breakthrough, acts, to, the, new, style, impressionism, today, too, these, works, along, with, others, are, considered, watershed, paintings, that, mark, the, start, of, modern, art, the, last, 20, years, of, manet, s, life, saw, him, form, bonds, with, other, great, artists, of, the, time, he, developed, his, own, simple, and, direct, style, that, would, be, heralded, as, innovative, and, serve, as, a, major, influence, for, future, painters, douard, manet, was, born, in, paris, on, 23, january, 1832, in, the, ancestral, h, tel, particulier, mansion, on, the, rue, des, petits, augustins, now, rue, bonaparte, to, an, affluent, and, well, connected, family, his, mother, eug, nie, desir, e, fournier, was, the, daughter, of, a, diplomat, and, goddaughter, of, the, swedish, crown, prince, charles, bernadotte, from, whom, the, swedish, monarchs, are, descended, his, father, auguste, manet, was, a, french, judge, who, expected, douard, to, pursue, a, career, in, law, his, uncle, edmond, fournier, encouraged, him, to, pursue, painting, and, took, young, manet, to, the, louvre, in, 1844, he, enrolled, at, secondary, school, the, coll, ge, rollin, where, he, boarded, until, 1848, he, showed, little, academic, talent, and, was, generally, unhappy, at, the, school, in, 1845, at, the, advice, of, his, uncle, manet, enrolled, in, a, special, course, of, drawing, where, he, met, antonin, proust, future, minister, of, fine, arts, and, subsequent, lifelong, friend, at, his, father, s, suggestion, in, 1848, he, sailed, on, a, training, vessel, to, rio, de, janeiro, after, he, twice, failed, the, examination, to, join, the, navy, his, father, relented, to, his, wishes, to, pursue, an, art, education, from, 1850, to, 1856, manet, studied, under, the, academic, painter, thomas, couture, couture, encouraged, his, students, to, paint, contemporary, life, though, he, would, eventually, be, horrified, by, manet, s, choice, of, lower, class, and, degenerate, subjects, such, as, the, absinthe, drinker, in, his, spare, time, manet, copied, old, masters, such, as, diego, vel, zquez, and, titian, in, the, louvre, from, 1853, to, 1856, manet, made, brief, visits, to, germany, italy, and, the, netherlands, during, which, time, he, was, influenced, by, the, dutch, painter, frans, hals, and, the, spanish, artists, vel, zquez, and, francisco, jos, de, goya, in, 1856, manet, opened, a, studio, his, style, in, this, period, was, characterized, by, loose, brush, strokes, simplification, of, details, and, the, suppression, of, transitional, tones, adopting, the, current, style, of, realism, initiated, by, gustave, courbet, he, painted, the, absinthe, drinker, 1858, 59, and, other, contemporary, subjects, such, as, beggars, singers, romani, people, in, caf, s, and, bullfights, after, his, early, career, he, rarely, painted, religious, mythological, or, historical, subjects, religious, paintings, from, 1864, include, his, jesus, mocked, by, the, soldiers, and, the, dead, christ, with, angels, manet, had, two, canvases, accepted, at, the, salon, in, 1861, a, portrait, of, his, mother, and, father, portrait, of, monsieur, and, madame, manet, the, latter, of, whom, at, the, time, was, paralysed, by, a, stroke, or, advanced, syphilis, was, ill, received, by, critics, the, other, the, spanish, singer, was, admired, by, th, ophile, gautier, and, placed, in, a, more, conspicuous, location, as, a, result, of, its, popularity, with, salon, goers, manet, s, work, which, appeared, slightly, slapdash, when, compared, with, the, meticulous, style, of, so, many, other, salon, paintings, intrigued, some, young, artists, and, brought, new, business, to, his, studio, according, to, one, contemporary, source, the, spanish, singer, painted, in, a, strange, new, fashion, caused, many, painters, eyes, to, open, and, their, jaws, to, drop, in, 1862, manet, exhibited, music, in, the, tuileries, probably, painted, in, 1860, one, of, his, first, masterpieces, with, its, portrayal, of, a, crowd, of, subjects, at, the, jardin, des, tuileries, the, painting, shows, the, outdoor, leisure, of, contemporary, paris, which, would, be, a, lifelong, subject, of, manet, s, among, the, figures, in, the, gardens, are, the, poet, charles, baudelaire, the, musician, jacques, offenbach, and, others, of, manet, s, family, and, friends, including, a, self, portrait, of, the, artist, music, in, the, tuileries, received, substantial, critical, and, public, attention, most, of, it, negative, in, the, words, of, one, manet, biographer, it, is, difficult, for, us, to, imagine, the, kind, of, fury, music, in, the, tuileries, provoked, when, it, was, exhibited, by, portraying, manet, s, social, circle, instead, of, classical, heroes, historical, icons, or, gods, the, painting, could, be, interpreted, as, challenging, the, value, of, those, subjects, or, as, an, attempt, to, elevate, his, contemporaries, to, the, same, level, the, public, accustomed, to, the, finely, detailed, brushwork, of, historical, painters, such, as, ernest, meissonier, thought, manet, s, thick, brushstrokes, looked, crude, and, unfinished, angered, by, the, subject, matter, and, technique, several, visitors, even, threatened, to, destroy, the, painting, one, of, manet, s, idols, eug, ne, delacroix, was, of, the, painting, s, few, defenders, despite, the, largely, negative, reaction, the, controversy, made, manet, a, well, known, name, in, paris, another, major, early, work, is, the, luncheon, on, the, grass, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, originally, le, bain, the, paris, salon, rejected, it, for, exhibition, in, 1863, but, manet, agreed, to, exhibit, it, at, the, salon, des, refus, s, salon, of, the, rejected, this, parallel, salon, was, initiated, by, emperor, napoleon, iii, as, a, solution, to, the, public, outcry, after, the, official, salon, s, selection, committee, only, accepted, 2217, paintings, out, of, more, than, 5000, submissions, and, allowed, rejected, artists, to, still, display, their, paintings, if, they, chose, the, painting, s, juxtaposition, of, fully, dressed, men, and, a, nude, woman, was, controversial, as, was, its, abbreviated, sketch, like, handling, an, innovation, that, distinguished, manet, from, courbet, one, critic, stated, that, the, brushwork, appeared, to, have, been, done, with, a, floor, mop, however, others, such, as, his, friend, antonin, proust, celebrated, the, painting, and, novelist, mile, zola, was, so, affected, by, the, experience, of, viewing, it, that, he, later, based, the, title, painting, in, his, novel, l, uvre, the, work, of, art, on, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, at, the, same, time, manet, s, composition, reveals, his, study, of, the, old, masters, as, the, disposition, of, the, main, figures, is, derived, from, marcantonio, raimondi, s, engraving, of, the, judgement, of, paris, c, 1515, based, on, a, drawing, by, raphael, two, additional, works, cited, by, scholars, as, important, precedents, for, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, are, pastoral, concert, c, 1510, and, the, tempest, both, of, which, are, attributed, variously, to, italian, renaissance, masters, giorgione, or, titian, le, d, jeuner, and, james, mcneill, whistler, s, symphony, in, white, no, 1, the, white, girl, were, the, two, most, discussed, works, of, the, salon, des, refus, s, which, itself, would, become, one, of, the, most, famous, art, exhibitions, of, all, time, following, the, salon, manet, became, yet, more, notorious, and, widely, discussed, however, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, and, manet, s, other, paintings, still, failed, to, sell, and, manet, continued, living, off, of, his, inheritance, from, his, recently, deceased, father, as, he, had, in, luncheon, on, the, grass, manet, again, paraphrased, a, respected, work, by, a, renaissance, artist, in, the, painting, olympia, 1863, a, nude, portrayed, in, a, style, reminiscent, of, early, studio, photographs, but, whose, pose, was, based, on, titian, s, venus, of, urbino, 1538, the, painting, is, also, reminiscent, of, francisco, goya, s, painting, the, nude, maja, 1800, manet, embarked, on, the, canvas, after, being, challenged, to, give, the, salon, a, nude, painting, to, display, his, uniquely, frank, depiction, of, a, self, assured, prostitute, was, accepted, by, the, paris, salon, in, 1865, where, it, created, a, scandal, according, to, antonin, proust, only, the, precautions, taken, by, the, administration, prevented, the, painting, being, punctured, and, torn, by, offended, viewers, the, painting, was, controversial, partly, because, the, nude, is, wearing, some, small, items, of, clothing, such, as, an, orchid, in, her, hair, a, bracelet, a, ribbon, around, her, neck, and, mule, slippers, all, of, which, accentuated, her, nakedness, sexuality, and, comfortable, courtesan, lifestyle, the, orchid, upswept, hair, black, cat, and, bouquet, of, flowers, were, all, recognized, symbols, of, sexuality, at, the, time, this, modern, venus, body, is, thin, counter, to, prevailing, standards, the, painting, s, lack, of, idealism, rankled, viewers, the, painting, s, flatness, inspired, by, japanese, wood, block, art, serves, to, make, the, nude, more, human, and, less, voluptuous, a, fully, dressed, black, servant, is, featured, exploiting, the, then, current, theory, that, black, people, were, hyper, sexed, that, she, is, wearing, the, clothing, of, a, servant, to, a, courtesan, here, furthers, the, sexual, tension, of, the, piece, olympia, s, body, as, well, as, her, gaze, is, unabashedly, confrontational, she, defiantly, looks, out, as, her, servant, offers, flowers, from, one, of, her, male, suitors, although, her, hand, rests, on, her, leg, hiding, her, pubic, area, the, reference, to, traditional, female, virtue, is, ironic, a, notion, of, modesty, is, notoriously, absent, in, this, work, a, contemporary, critic, denounced, olympia, s, shamelessly, flexed, left, hand, which, seemed, to, him, a, mockery, of, the, relaxed, shielding, hand, of, titian, s, venus, likewise, the, alert, black, cat, at, the, foot, of, the, bed, strikes, a, sexually, rebellious, note, in, contrast, to, that, of, the, sleeping, dog, in, titian, s, portrayal, of, the, goddess, in, his, venus, of, urbino, olympia, was, the, subject, of, caricatures, in, the, popular, press, but, was, championed, by, the, french, avant, garde, community, and, the, painting, s, significance, was, appreciated, by, artists, such, as, gustave, courbet, paul, c, zanne, claude, monet, and, later, paul, gauguin, as, with, luncheon, on, the, grass, the, painting, raised, the, issue, of, prostitution, within, contemporary, france, and, the, roles, of, women, within, society, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1862, manet, married, suzanne, leenhoff, in, 1863, at, a, protestant, church, leenhoff, was, a, dutch, born, piano, teacher, two, years, manet, s, senior, with, whom, he, had, been, romantically, involved, for, approximately, ten, years, leenhoff, initially, had, been, employed, by, manet, s, father, auguste, to, teach, manet, and, his, younger, brother, piano, she, also, may, have, been, auguste, s, mistress, in, 1852, leenhoff, gave, birth, out, of, wedlock, to, a, son, leon, koella, leenhoff, manet, painted, his, wife, in, the, reading, among, other, paintings, her, son, leon, leenhoff, whose, father, may, have, been, either, of, the, manets, posed, often, for, manet, most, famously, he, is, the, subject, of, the, boy, carrying, a, sword, of, 1861, metropolitan, museum, of, art, new, york, he, also, appears, as, the, boy, carrying, a, tray, in, the, background, of, the, balcony, 1868, 69, manet, became, friends, with, the, impressionists, edgar, degas, claude, monet, pierre, auguste, renoir, alfred, sisley, paul, c, zanne, and, camille, pissarro, through, another, painter, berthe, morisot, who, was, a, member, of, the, group, and, drew, him, into, their, activities, they, later, became, widely, known, as, the, batignolles, group, le, groupe, des, batignolles, the, supposed, grand, niece, of, the, painter, jean, honor, fragonard, morisot, had, her, first, painting, accepted, in, the, salon, de, paris, in, 1864, and, she, continued, to, show, in, the, salon, for, the, next, ten, years, manet, became, the, friend, and, colleague, of, morisot, in, 1868, she, is, credited, with, convincing, manet, to, attempt, plein, air, painting, which, she, had, been, practicing, since, she, was, introduced, to, it, by, another, friend, of, hers, camille, corot, they, had, a, reciprocating, relationship, and, manet, incorporated, some, of, her, techniques, into, his, paintings, in, 1874, she, became, his, sister, in, law, when, she, married, his, brother, eug, ne, it, has, been, speculated, that, there, was, a, repressed, love, between, manet, and, morisot, exemplified, by, the, numerous, portraits, he, did, of, her, before, she, married, his, brother, unlike, the, core, impressionist, group, manet, maintained, that, modern, artists, should, seek, to, exhibit, at, the, paris, salon, rather, than, abandon, it, in, favor, of, independent, exhibitions, nevertheless, when, manet, was, excluded, from, the, international, exhibition, of, 1867, he, set, up, his, own, exhibition, his, mother, worried, that, he, would, waste, all, his, inheritance, on, this, project, which, was, enormously, expensive, while, the, exhibition, earned, poor, reviews, from, the, major, critics, it, also, provided, his, first, contacts, with, several, future, impressionist, painters, including, degas, although, his, own, work, influenced, and, anticipated, the, impressionist, style, manet, resisted, involvement, in, impressionist, exhibitions, partly, because, he, did, not, wish, to, be, seen, as, the, representative, of, a, group, identity, and, partly, because, he, preferred, to, exhibit, at, the, salon, eva, gonzal, s, a, daughter, of, the, novelist, emmanuel, gonzal, s, was, his, only, formal, student, he, was, influenced, by, the, impressionists, especially, monet, and, morisot, their, influence, is, seen, in, manet, s, use, of, lighter, colors, after, the, early, 1870s, he, made, less, use, of, dark, backgrounds, but, retained, his, distinctive, use, of, black, uncharacteristic, of, impressionist, painting, he, painted, many, outdoor, plein, air, pieces, but, always, returned, to, what, he, considered, the, serious, work, of, the, studio, manet, enjoyed, a, close, friendship, with, composer, emmanuel, chabrier, painting, two, portraits, of, him, the, musician, owned, 14, of, manet, s, paintings, and, dedicated, his, impromptu, to, manet, s, wife, one, of, manet, s, frequent, models, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1880s, was, the, semimondaine, m, ry, laurent, who, posed, for, seven, portraits, in, pastel, laurent, s, salons, hosted, many, french, and, even, american, writers, and, painters, of, her, time, manet, had, connections, and, influence, through, such, events, throughout, his, life, although, resisted, by, art, critics, manet, could, number, as, his, champions, mile, zola, who, supported, him, publicly, in, the, press, st, phane, mallarm, and, charles, baudelaire, who, challenged, him, to, depict, life, as, it, was, manet, in, turn, drew, or, painted, each, of, them, manet, s, paintings, of, caf, scenes, are, observations, of, social, life, in, 19th, century, paris, people, are, depicted, drinking, beer, listening, to, music, flirting, reading, or, waiting, many, of, these, paintings, were, based, on, sketches, executed, on, the, spot, manet, often, visited, the, brasserie, reichshoffen, on, boulevard, de, rochechourt, upon, which, he, based, at, the, cafe, in, 1878, several, people, are, at, the, bar, and, one, woman, confronts, the, viewer, while, others, wait, to, be, served, such, depictions, represent, the, painted, journal, of, a, fl, neur, these, are, painted, in, a, style, which, is, loose, referencing, hals, and, vel, zquez, yet, they, capture, the, mood, and, feeling, of, parisian, night, life, they, are, painted, snapshots, of, bohemianism, urban, working, people, as, well, as, some, of, the, bourgeoisie, in, corner, of, a, caf, concert, a, man, smokes, while, behind, him, a, waitress, serves, drinks,

with, arms, extended, as, she, is, about, to, turn, is, on, stage, in, the, background, manet, also, sat, at, the, restaurant, on, the, avenue, de, clichy, called, pere, lathuille, s, which, had, a, garden, in, addition, to, the, dining, area, one, of, the, paintings, he, produced, here, was, chez, le, p, re, lathuille, at, pere, lathuille, s, in, which, a, man, displays, an, unrequited,

to, underscore, the, furious, energy, of, racehorses, as, they, rush, toward, the, viewer, in, skating, manet, shows, a, well, dressed, woman, in, the, foreground, while, others, skate, behind, her,

first, such, work, was, the, battle, of, the, kearsarge, and, the, alabama, 1864, a, sea, skirmish, known, as, the, battle, of, cherbourg, from, the, american, civil, war, which, took, place, off, the, french, coast, and, may, have, been, witnessed, by, the, artist, of, interest, next, was, the, french, intervention, in, mexico, from, 1867, to, 1869, manet, painted, three, versions, of, the, execution, of, emperor, maximilian, an, event, which, raised, concerns, regarding, french, foreign, and, domestic, policy, the, several, versions, of, the, execution, are, among, manet, s, largest, paintings, which, suggests, that, the, theme, was, one, which, the, painter, regarded, as, most, important, its, subject, is, the, execution, by, mexican, firing, squad, of, a, habsburg, emperor, who, had, been, installed, by, napoleon, iii, neither, the, paintings, nor, a, lithograph, of, the, subject, were, permitted, to, be, shown, in, france, as, an, indictment, of, formalized, slaughter, the,

with, stating, that, an, artist, can, say, everything, he, has, to, say, with, flowers, fruit, and, clouds, his, last, flower, paintings, are, a, demonstration, of, that, belief, in, 2023, the,

admirers, from, the, beginning, one, was, mile, zola, who, wrote, in, 1867, we, are, not, accustomed, to, seeing, such, simple, and, direct, translations, of, reality, then, as, i, said, there, is, such, a, surprisingly, elegant, awkwardness, it, is, a, truly, charming, experience, to, contemplate, this, luminous, and, serious, painting, which, interprets, nature, with, a, gentle, brutality, the, roughly, painted, style, and, photographic, lighting, in, manet, s, paintings, was, seen, as, specifically, modern, and, as, a, challenge, to, the, renaissance, works, he, copied, or, used, as, source, material, he, rejected, the, technique, he, had, learned, in, the, studio, of, thomas, couture, in, which, a, painting, was, constructed, using, successive, layers, of, paint, on, a, dark, toned, ground, in, favor, of, a, direct, alla, prima, method, using, opaque, paint, on, a, light, ground, novel, at, the, time, this, method, made, possible, the, completion, of, a, painting, in, a, single, sitting, it, was, adopted, by, the, impressionists, and, became, the, prevalent, method, of, painting, in, oils, for, generations, that, followed, manet, s, work, is, considered, early, modern, partially, because, of, the, opaque, flatness, of, his, surfaces, the, frequent, sketch, like, passages, and, the, black, outlining, of, figures, all, of, which, draw, attention, to, the, surface, of, the, picture, plane, and, the, material, quality, of, paint, the, art, historian, beatrice, farwell, says, manet, has, been, universally, regarded, as, the, father, of, modernism, with, courbet, he, was, among, the, first, to, take, serious, risks, with, the, public, whose, favour, he, sought, the, first, to, make, alla, prima, painting, the, standard, technique, for, oil, painting, and, one, of, the, first, to, take, liberties, with, renaissance, perspective, and, to, offer, pure, painting, as, a, source, of, aesthetic, pleasure, he, was, a, pioneer, again, with, courbet, in, the, rejection, of, humanistic, and, historical, subject, matter, and, shared, with, degas, the, establishment, of, modern, urban, life, as, acceptable, material, for, high, art, the, late, manet,
