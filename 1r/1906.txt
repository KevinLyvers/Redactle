scoring, record, of, bob, pettit, who, needed, 72, games, to, score, 2, 101, points, chamberlain, broke, eight, nba, records, and, he, was, named, both, rookie, of, the, year, and, mvp, that, season, the, warriors, entered, the, 1960, nba, playoffs, and, beat, the, syracuse, nationals, setting, up, a, game, against, the, eastern, division, champion, celtics, according, to, cherry, celtics, coach, auerbach, ordered, his, forward, tom, heinsohn, to, commit, personal, fouls, on, chamberlain, whenever, the, warriors, took, foul, shots, heinsohn, grabbed, and, shoved, chamberlain, to, prevent, him, from, running, back, quickly, auerbach, s, intention, was, for, the, celtics, to, throw, the, ball, quickly, enough, to, prevent, chamberlain, a, prolific, shot, blocker, from, returning, to, his, own, basket, in, time, and, boston, could, score, an, easy, fastbreak, basket, the, teams, split, the, first, two, games, but, chamberlain, became, annoyed, with, heinsohn, and, punched, him, during, game, 3, in, the, scuffle, chamberlain, injured, his, hand, and, philadelphia, lost, the, next, two, games, in, game, 5, with, his, hand, healthy, chamberlain, recorded, 50, points, and, 35, rebounds, in, a, 128, 107, win, over, the, celtics, extending, the, series, to, a, game, 6, in, game, 6, heinsohn, scored, the, decisive, basket, with, a, last, second, tip, in, and, the, warriors, lost, the, series, 4, 2, chamberlain, then, shocked, warriors, fans, by, saying, he, was, thinking, of, retiring, he, was, tired, of, being, double, teamed, or, triple, teamed, and, of, teams, executing, hard, personal, fouls, on, him, he, also, expressed, a, constant, fear, that, he, might, lose, his, temper, one, day, celtics, forward, heinsohn, said, half, the, fouls, against, him, were, hard, fouls, he, took, the, most, brutal, pounding, of, any, player, ever, gottlieb, coaxed, chamberlain, back, into, the, nba, with, a, salary, increase, to, 65, 000, chamberlain, s, 1960, 61, nba, season, started, with, a, 42, point, and, 31, rebound, performance, in, a, 133, 123, road, win, against, the, syracuse, nationals, on, november, 24, 1960, chamberlain, grabbed, an, nba, record, 55, rebounds, along, with, 34, points, and, 4, assists, in, a, 132, 129, home, loss, against, the, russell, led, boston, celtics, on, november, 29, chamberlain, recorded, 44, points, 38, rebounds, and, a, then, career, high, 7, assists, in, a, 122, 121, road, win, over, the, los, angeles, lakers, chamberlain, exceeded, his, rookie, season, statistics, averaging, 38, 4, points, and, 27, 2, rebounds, per, game, he, became, the, first, player, to, score, more, than, 3, 000, points, and, the, first, and, still, the, only, player, to, exceed, 2, 000, rebounds, in, a, single, season, grabbing, 2, 149, boards, chamberlain, won, his, first, field, goal, percentage, title, scored, almost, 32, of, his, team, s, points, and, collected, 30, 4, of, their, rebounds, chamberlain, failed, to, convert, his, play, into, team, success, this, time, bowing, out, against, the, nationals, in, a, three, game, sweep, according, to, cherry, chamberlain, was, difficult, and, did, not, respect, coach, johnston, who, was, unable, to, handle, him, in, retrospect, gottlieb, said, my, mistake, was, not, getting, a, strong, handed, coach, wasn, t, ready, for, big, time, in, the, 1961, 62, nba, season, the, warriors, were, coached, by, frank, mcguire, who, had, masterminded, chamberlain, s, triple, overtime, loss, in, the, ncaa, championship, against, the, tar, heels, in, that, year, chamberlain, set, several, all, time, records, which, have, since, never, been, threatened, he, averaged, 50, 4, points, and, grabbed, 25, 7, rebounds, per, game, chamberlain, s, 4, 029, regular, season, points, made, him, the, only, player, to, score, more, than, 4, 000, points, chamberlain, posted, 2, 052, rebounds, and, played, for, an, average, of, 48, 53, minutes, per, game, playing, 3, 882, of, his, team, s, 3, 890, minutes, because, chamberlain, played, in, overtime, games, he, averaged, more, minutes, per, game, than, the, regulation, 48, and, would, have, played, every, minute, if, he, had, not, been, ejected, in, one, game, after, picking, up, a, second, technical, foul, with, eight, minutes, left, to, play, on, march, 2, 1962, on, a, neutral, court, against, the, new, york, knicks, in, hershey, pennsylvania, chamberlain, scored, 100, points, he, shot, 36, of, 63, from, the, field, and, uncharacteristically, made, 28, of, 32, free, throws, joe, ruklick, got, the, assist, for, chamberlain, s, 100th, point, the, game, was, not, recorded, on, video, and, only, a, radio, broadcast, of, the, fourth, quarter, remains, one, writer, notes, the, lack, of, video, of, the, 100, point, game, only, added, to, its, mystique, for, years, former, nba, commissioner, david, stern, s, office, phone, would, play, announcer, bill, campbell, s, call, of, the, 100, point, basket, to, callers, on, hold, he, made, it, he, made, it, he, made, it, a, dipper, dunk, in, addition, to, chamberlain, s, regular, season, accomplishments, he, scored, 42, points, in, the, all, star, game, in, the, playoffs, the, warriors, again, played, against, the, boston, celtics, in, the, eastern, division, finals, both, cousy, and, russell, called, this, season, the, greatest, celtics, team, of, all, time, each, team, won, their, home, games, so, the, series, was, split, at, three, after, six, games, in, a, closely, contested, game, 7, chamberlain, tied, the, game, at, 107, with, 16, seconds, to, go, but, celtics, shooting, guard, sam, jones, hit, a, clutch, shot, with, two, seconds, left, to, win, the, series, for, boston, in, later, years, chamberlain, was, criticized, for, averaging, 50, points, but, not, winning, a, title, mcguire, said, wilt, has, been, simply, super, human, and, that, the, warriors, lacked, a, consistent, second, scorer, a, playmaker, and, a, second, big, man, to, take, pressure, off, chamberlain, in, the, 1962, 63, nba, season, gottlieb, sold, the, warriors, franchise, for, 850, 000, to, a, group, of, businessmen, led, by, franklin, mieuli, from, san, francisco, and, the, team, relocated, and, were, renamed, the, san, francisco, warriors, under, new, coach, bob, feerick, this, meant, the, warriors, team, dispersed, arizin, chose, to, retire, rather, than, move, away, from, his, family, and, his, job, at, ibm, in, philadelphia, coach, mcguire, resigned, rather, than, move, to, the, west, coast, and, gola, was, homesick, and, requesting, a, trade, to, the, new, york, knicks, halfway, through, the, season, with, both, secondary, scorers, gone, chamberlain, continued, exceeding, his, own, statistics, averaging, 44, 8, points, and, 24, 3, rebounds, per, game, that, year, despite, his, individual, success, the, warriors, lost, 49, of, their, 80, games, and, missed, the, playoffs, in, the, 1963, 64, nba, season, chamberlain, got, another, new, coach, former, nba, player, and, ex, soldier, alex, hannum, and, was, joined, by, rookie, center, nate, thurmond, who, later, entered, the, hall, of, fame, hannum, who, later, entered, the, hall, of, fame, as, a, coach, was, a, crafty, psychologist, who, emphasized, defense, and, passing, and, was, not, afraid, to, stand, up, to, the, dominant, chamberlain, who, would, not, communicate, with, coaches, he, did, not, like, backed, up, by, thurmond, chamberlain, recorded, 36, 9, points, and, 22, 3, rebounds, per, game, and, the, warriors, reached, the, nba, finals, in, that, series, they, again, succumbed, to, russell, s, boston, celtics, losing, 4, 1, according, to, cherry, chamberlain, and, hannum, deserved, much, credit, because, hannum, had, taken, the, previous, year, s, 31, 49, squad, plus, thurmond, and, became, an, nba, finals, contender, in, mid, 1964, chamberlain, a, prominent, participant, at, rucker, park, basketball, court, in, new, york, city, made, the, acquaintance, of, lew, alcindor, a, tall, talented, 17, year, old, who, played, there, alcindor, was, soon, allowed, into, chamberlain, s, inner, circle, and, quickly, idolized, the, ten, year, older, chamberlain, the, pair, later, developed, an, intense, rivalry, and, personal, antipathy, in, the, 1964, 65, nba, season, the, nba, widened, the, lane, from, 12, to, 16, feet, 3, 7, to, 4, 9, m, especially, because, of, centers, like, chamberlain, the, warriors, season, began, poorly, and, they, experienced, financial, trouble, at, the, 1965, all, star, weekend, chamberlain, was, traded, to, the, philadelphia, 76ers, the, renamed, former, rival, and, relocated, syracuse, nationals, chamberlain, did, not, like, sixers, coach, dolph, schayes, whom, he, thought, had, made, several, disrespectful, remarks, when, they, were, rival, players, the, warriors, received, 150, 000, and, paul, neumann, connie, dierking, and, lee, shaffer, who, opted, to, retire, rather, than, report, to, the, warriors, when, chamberlain, left, the, warriors, owner, franklin, mieuli, said, chamberlain, is, not, an, easy, man, to, love, the, fans, in, san, francisco, never, learned, to, love, him, wilt, is, easy, to, hate, people, came, to, see, him, lose, after, the, trade, a, reluctant, chamberlain, found, himself, on, a, promising, sixers, team, that, included, veteran, shooting, guard, and, future, hall, of, famer, hal, greer, and, talented, role, players, such, as, point, guard, larry, costello, small, forward, chet, walker, and, centers, johnny, red, kerr, and, lucious, jackson, the, team, also, included, all, rookie, forward, billy, cunningham, in, the, new, sixth, man, role, cherry, noted, there, was, tension, within, the, team, because, greer, was, the, formerly, undisputed, leader, and, was, not, willing, to, give, up, his, authority, and, jackson, a, talented, center, was, now, forced, to, play, power, forward, because, chamberlain, occupied, the, center, spot, as, the, season, progressed, however, the, three, began, to, work, together, more, closely, chamberlain, posted, 34, 7, points, and, 22, 9, rebounds, per, game, overall, for, the, season, future, georgetown, coach, john, thompson, then, a, rookie, for, the, boston, celtics, elbowed, chamberlain, in, the, face, and, broke, his, nose, causing, him, to, wear, a, face, mask, in, several, games, after, defeating, the, cincinnati, royals, a, team, led, by, fellow, all, american, oscar, robertson, in, the, playoffs, the, sixers, played, against, chamberlain, s, rival, boston, celtics, the, press, called, it, an, even, match, in, all, positions, even, at, center, where, russell, was, expected, to, give, chamberlain, a, tough, battle, the, teams, split, the, first, six, games, and, the, last, game, was, held, in, the, celtics, boston, garden, because, of, their, better, season, record, in, that, game, 7, chamberlain, scored, 30, points, and, 32, rebounds, while, russell, logged, 16, points, 27, rebounds, and, eight, assists, in, the, final, minute, chamberlain, hit, two, clutch, free, throws, and, slam, dunked, on, russell, reducing, boston, s, lead, to, 110, 109, with, five, seconds, left, russell, s, inbounds, pass, hit, a, guy, wire, supporting, the, backboard, giving, the, ball, back, to, the, sixers, coach, schayes, called, timeout, and, decided, it, would, be, unwise, to, pass, the, ball, to, chamberlain, whom, he, feared, the, celtics, would, intentionally, foul, red, kerr, set, a, pick, on, sam, jones, to, free, chet, walker, when, greer, attempted, to, inbound, the, ball, to, walker, john, havlicek, stole, the, ball, to, preserve, the, celtics, lead, for, the, fifth, time, in, seven, years, russell, s, team, deprived, chamberlain, of, the, title, according, to, chamberlain, it, was, in, this, game, people, started, calling, him, a, loser, in, an, interview, in, the, april, 1965, issue, of, sports, illustrated, chamberlain, criticized, his, fellow, players, coaches, and, nba, administrators, chamberlain, later, said, he, could, see, in, hindsight, the, interview, was, instrumental, in, damaging, his, public, image, in, the, 1965, 66, nba, season, ike, richman, the, sixers, co, owner, as, well, as, chamberlain, s, confidant, and, lawyer, died, of, a, heart, attack, while, attending, a, road, game, in, boston, the, sixers, posted, a, 55, 25, regular, season, record, and, chamberlain, won, his, second, mvp, award, in, that, season, chamberlain, again, dominated, his, opposition, by, recording, 33, 5, points, and, 24, 6, rebounds, a, game, leading, the, league, in, both, categories, in, one, game, chamberlain, dislocated, the, shoulder, of, baltimore, bullets, player, gus, johnson, by, blocking, his, dunk, attempt, off, the, court, chamberlain, s, commitment, to, the, team, was, doubted, because, he, was, a, late, sleeper, and, lived, in, new, york, city, preferring, to, commute, to, philadelphia, rather, than, live, there, and, he, was, only, available, for, training, in, the, afternoon, because, schayes, did, not, want, to, risk, angering, his, best, player, he, scheduled, the, daily, workout, at, 4, pm, this, angered, the, rest, of, the, team, who, preferred, an, early, schedule, that, allowed, them, the, afternoon, off, but, schayes, dismissed, their, protests, irv, kosloff, who, owned, the, sixers, alone, after, richman, s, death, unsuccessfully, pleaded, with, chamberlain, to, move, to, philadelphia, during, the, season, in, the, playoffs, the, sixers, again, played, the, boston, celtics, and, for, the, first, time, had, home, court, advantage, boston, won, the, first, two, games, on, the, road, winning, 115, 96, and, 114, 93, while, chamberlain, played, within, his, usual, range, his, fellow, team, members, shot, under, 40, this, caused, sports, journalist, joe, mcginnis, to, comment, the, celtics, played, like, champions, and, the, sixers, just, played, in, game, 3, chamberlain, scored, 31, points, and, 27, rebounds, for, the, road, win, when, coach, schayes, planned, to, hold, a, joint, team, practice, the, next, day, chamberlain, said, he, was, too, tired, to, attend, and, refused, schayes, plea, to, attend, and, shoot, a, few, foul, shots, with, the, team, in, game, 4, boston, won, 114, 108, prior, to, game, 5, chamberlain, skipped, practice, and, was, non, accessible, schayes, defended, chamberlain, as, excused, from, practice, but, his, teammates, knew, the, truth, and, were, less, forgiving, in, game, 5, chamberlain, scored, 46, points, and, grabbed, 34, rebounds, but, the, celtics, won, the, game, 120, 112, and, the, series, according, to, cherry, chamberlain, was, the, only, sixers, player, who, performed, in, the, series, but, his, unprofessional, egotistical, behavior, set, a, poor, example, for, his, teammates, prior, to, the, 1966, 67, nba, season, schayes, was, replaced, by, the, more, assertive, alex, hannum, according, to, cherry, in, a, locker, room, meeting, hannum, addressed, several, key, issues, he, observed, during, the, last, season, several, of, them, putting, chamberlain, in, an, unfavorable, light, sixers, forward, walker, said, on, several, occasions, players, had, to, pull, chamberlain, and, hannum, apart, to, prevent, a, fistfight, cunningham, commented, hannum, never, backed, down, and, showed, who, was, the, boss, winning, chamberlain, s, respect, when, emotions, dissipated, hannum, told, chamberlain, he, was, also, trying, to, win, a, title, but, that, to, achieve, this, chamberlain, had, to, act, like, a, man, both, on, and, off, the, court, hannum, persuaded, chamberlain, to, change, his, style, of, play, and, wanted, chamberlain, to, concentrate, more, on, defense, than, on, trying, to, score, kerr, was, traded, to, the, baltimore, bullets, for, point, guard, wali, jones, and, shooting, guard, matt, guokas, was, selected, in, the, first, round, of, the, 1966, nba, draft, as, a, result, of, his, style, of, play, change, chamberlain, averaged, a, career, low, 24, 1, points, and, took, only, 14, of, the, team, s, shots, but, was, extremely, efficient, with, a, record, breaking, 683, field, goal, accuracy, he, also, led, the, league, in, rebounds, per, game, 24, 2, was, third, in, assists, per, game, 7, 8, and, played, strong, defense, his, efficiency, that, season, was, reflected, by, 35, consecutive, made, field, goals, over, four, games, in, february, for, these, achievements, chamberlain, earned, his, third, mvp, award, the, sixers, had, a, then, record, 68, 13, season, including, a, record, 46, 4, start, the, formerly, egotistical, chamberlain, began, to, praise, his, teammates, lauding, hardworking, lucious, jackson, as, the, ultimate, power, forward, calling, greer, a, deadly, jump, shooter, and, jones, an, excellent, defender, and, outside, scorer, off, the, court, chamberlain, invited, the, team, to, restaurants, and, paid, the, entire, bill, knowing, he, earned, ten, times, more, than, the, others, greer, who, was, considered, a, consummate, professional, and, often, clashed, with, chamberlain, because, of, his, attitude, spoke, positively, of, him, saying, you, knew, in, a, minute, the, big, fella, was, ready, to, go, and, everybody, would, follow, in, the, playoffs, the, sixers, again, played, the, boston, celtics, in, the, eastern, division, finals, and, held, home, court, advantage, in, game, 1, the, sixers, beat, boston, 127, 112, powered, by, greer, s, 39, points, and, chamberlain, s, unofficial, quadruple, double, with, 24, points, 32, rebounds, 13, assists, and, 12, unofficially, counted, blocks, in, game, 2, the, sixers, won, 107, 102, in, overtime, and, player, coach, russell, grudgingly, praised, chamberlain, for, intimidating, the, celtics, into, taking, low, percentage, shots, from, further, outside, in, game, 3, chamberlain, grabbed, 41, rebounds, and, helped, the, sixers, win, 115, 104, the, celtics, prevented, a, sweep, by, winning, game, 4, with, a, 121, 117, victory, russell, who, was, coming, close, to, the, first, real, loss, of, his, career, said, right, now, he, is, playing, like, me, in, game, 5, the, sixers, outscored, the, celtics, 140, 116, ending, boston, s, historic, run, of, eight, consecutive, nba, titles, chamberlain, scored, 29, points, 36, rebounds, and, 13, assists, and, was, praised, by, the, celtics, russell, and, k, c, jones, philadelphia, fans, chanted, boston, is, dead, in, the, 1967, nba, finals, the, sixers, played, against, chamberlain, s, old, team, the, san, francisco, warriors, who, were, led, by, future, hall, of, famers, star, forward, rick, barry, and, center, nate, thurmond, the, sixers, won, the, first, two, games, chamberlain, and, greer, took, credit, for, defense, and, clutch, shooting, the, warriors, won, game, 3, the, sixers, won, game, 4, with, chamberlain, contributing, an, official, 10, blocked, shots, and, the, warriors, won, game, 5, so, philadelphia, was, up, 3, 2, prior, to, game, 6, in, game, 6, the, warriors, were, trailing, 123, 122, with, 15, seconds, left, for, the, last, play, thurmond, and, barry, tried, a, pick, and, roll, against, chamberlain, and, walker, but, the, sixers, foiled, it, because, walker, held, up, thurmond, s, ability, to, roll, and, barry, was, defended, by, chamberlain, making, it, impossible, to, shoot, by, the, time, barry, made, his, move, walker, recovered, back, to, barry, who, was, stuck, in, the, air, and, botched, the, shot, jackson, forced, a, jump, ball, on, the, rebound, and, the, sixers, won, the, championship, chamberlain, who, contributed, with, 17, 7, points, and, 28, 7, rebounds, per, game, against, thurmond, snaring, at, least, 23, rebounds, in, the, six, games, said, it, is, wonderful, to, be, a, part, of, the, greatest, team, in, basketball, being, a, champion, is, like, having, a, big, round, glow, inside, of, you, this, sixers, team, has, been, ranked, as, one, of, the, best, in, nba, history, in, the, 1967, 68, nba, season, the, relationship, between, chamberlain, and, sixers, owner, kosloff, continued, to, deteriorate, in, 1965, chamberlain, said, he, and, richman, had, worked, out, a, deal, that, would, give, chamberlain, 25, of, the, franchise, once, he, ended, his, career, although, there, is, no, written, proof, of, this, agreement, schayes, and, sixers, lawyer, alan, levitt, assumed, chamberlain, was, correct, kosloff, declined, the, request, angering, chamberlain, who, was, willing, to, move, to, the, rival, american, basketball, association, aba, once, his, contract, ended, in, 1967, kosloff, and, chamberlain, worked, out, a, truce, and, later, signed, a, one, year, 250, 000, contract, on, court, chamberlain, continued, his, focus, on, team, play, and, registered, 24, 3, points, and, 23, 8, rebounds, a, game, for, the, season, on, march, 18, 1968, in, a, 158, 128, victory, against, the, los, angeles, lakers, chamberlain,

best, record, in, the, league, for, the, third, consecutive, season, and, chamberlain, became, the, only, center, in, nba, history, to, finish, the, season, as, the, leader, in, total, assists, his, 702, beating, runner, up, point, guard, and, future, hall, of, famer, lenny, wilkens, total, by, 23, chamberlain, likened, his, assist, title, to, baseball, home, run, hitter, babe, ruth, leading, the, league, in, sacrifice, bunts, and, felt, he, dispelled, the, myth, he, was, incapable, or, unwilling, to, pass, the, ball, for, these, achievements, chamberlain, won, his, fourth, and, final, mvp, title, he, also, scored, his, 25, 000th, point, making, him, the, first, ever, player, to, score, that, many, points, he, gave, the, ball, to, team, physician, stan, lorber, the, sixers, won, 62, games, and, took, the, first, seed, of, the, playoffs, in, the, eastern, division, semifinals, they, played, against, the, new, york, knicks, in, a, physically, tough, matchup, the, sixers, lost,

despite, the, sixers, injury, woes, coach, hannum, was, confident, that, they, could, take, the, celtics, in, less, than, seven, games, and, referenced, the, higher, age, of, the, celtics, a, team, built, around, russell, and, jones, both, 34, on, april, 4, civil, rights, leader, martin, luther, king, jr, was, assassinated, with, eight, of, the, ten, starting, players, on, the, sixers, and, celtics, being, african, american, both, teams, were, in, deep, shock, and, there, were, calls, to, cancel, the, series, in, a, game, the, following, day, called, unreal, and, devoid, of, emotion, the, sixers, lost, 127, 118, after, attending, king, s, funeral, chamberlain, called, out, to, the, angry, rioters, who, were, setting, fires, all, over, the, country, stating, king, would, not, have, approved, in, game, 2, philadelphia, evened, the, series, with, a, 115, 106, victory, and, won, games, 3, and, 4, with, chamberlain, suspiciously, often, played, by, celtics, backup, center, wayne, embry, causing, the, press, to, speculate, russell, was, worn, down, prior, to, game, 5, the, sixers, seemed, poised, to, win, the, series, because, no, nba, team, had, overcome, a, 3, 1, deficit, before, the, celtics, however, rallied, winning, the, next, two, games, 122, 104, and, 114, 106, respectively, powered, by, a, spirited, john, havlicek, and, helped, by, the, sixers, poor, shooting, in, game, 7, 15, 202, philadelphia, fans, witnessed, a, 100, 96, defeat, for, the, sixers, making, it, the, first, time, in, nba, history, a, team, lost, a, series, after, leading, 3, 1, according, to, cherry, the, sixers, shot, poorly, greer, jones, walker, jackson, and, guokas, hit, a, combined, 25, of, 74, shots, while, chamberlain, grabbed, 34, rebounds, and, shot, 4, of, 9, for, a, total, of, 14, points, in, the, second, half, of, game, 7, chamberlain, did, not, attempt, a, shot, from, the, field, cherry, said, there, is, a, strange, pattern, in, that, game, because, in, a, typical, sixers, game, chamberlain, got, the, ball, 60, times, in, the, low, post, but, only, 23, times, in, game, 7, with, seven, in, the, third, quarter, and, twice, in, the, fourth, quarter, chamberlain, later, blamed, coach, hannum, for, the, lack, of, touches, a, point, hannum, conceded, cherry, comments, chamberlain, who, always, thought, of, himself, as, the, best, player, of, all, time, should, have, been, outspoken, enough, to, demand, the, ball, the, loss, meant, chamberlain, was, 1, 6, in, playoff, series, against, the, celtics, after, that, season, hannum, wanted, to, be, closer, to, his, family, on, the, west, coast, he, left, the, sixers, to, coach, the, oakland, oaks, in, the, newly, founded, aba, chamberlain, then, asked, for, a, trade, and, sixers, general, manager, jack, ramsay, traded, him, to, the, los, angeles, lakers, for, darrall, imhoff, archie, clark, and, jerry, chambers, the, motivation, for, this, move, remains, in, dispute, according, to, sportswriter, roland, lazenby, a, journalist, close, to, the, lakers, chamberlain, was, angry, at, kosloff, for, breaking, the, purported, chamberlain, richman, deal, according, to, ramsay, chamberlain, threatened, to, move, to, the, aba, after, hannum, left, and, forced, the, trade, according, to, cherry, there, are, several, personal, reasons, among, them, chamberlain, feeling, he, had, grown, too, big, for, philadelphia, and, sought, the, presence, of, fellow, celebrities, of, which, there, were, plenty, in, los, angeles, and, that, he, wanted, the, opportunity, to, date, white, women, which, was, possible, for, a, black, man, in, los, angeles, but, less, acceptable, elsewhere, on, july, 9, 1968, the, trade, between, the, los, angeles, lakers, and, the, sixers, was, completed, making, it, the, first, time, a, reigning, nba, mvp, was, traded, the, next, season, lakers, owner, jack, kent, cooke, gave, chamberlain, an, unprecedented, contract, paying, him, 250, 000, after, taxes, about, 2, 2, million, in, real, value, in, comparison, previous, lakers, top, earner, jerry, west, was, paid, 100, 000, before, taxes, about, 880, 000, in, real, value, for, the, 1968, 69, nba, season, chamberlain, joined, a, squad, that, included, his, fellow, former, all, american, forward, elgin, baylor, hall, of, fame, guard, jerry, west, backup, center, mel, counts, forwards, keith, erickson, and, tom, hawkins, and, 5, ft, 11, in, 1, 80, m, guard, johnny, egan, according, to, cherry, chamberlain, was, not, a, natural, leader, or, a, loyal, follower, which, made, it, difficult, to, fit, in, while, he, was, on, cordial, terms, with, west, chamberlain, often, argued, with, team, captain, baylor, later, saying, in, regard, to, baylor, we, were, good, friends, but, black, culture, you, never, let, the, other, guy, one, up, you, the, lack, of, a, second, guard, next, to, west, and, the, lack, of, speed, concerned, coach, butch, van, breda, kolff, after, losing, clark, and, hall, of, fame, guard, gail, goodrich, who, joined, the, phoenix, suns, after, the, 1968, nba, expansion, draft, he, said, egan, gets, murdered, on, defense, because, of, his, size, but, if, i, don, t, play, him, we, look, like, a, bunch, of, trucks, the, greatest, problem, was, his, tense, relationship, with, van, breda, kolff, pejoratively, calling, the, new, recruit, the, load, van, breda, kolff, later, said, chamberlain, was, egotistical, never, respected, him, too, often, slacked, off, in, practice, and, focused, too, much, on, his, own, statistics, chamberlain, described, van, breda, kolff, as, the, dumbest, and, worst, coach, ever, erickson, commented, butch, catered, to, elgin, and, jerry, and, that, is, not, a, good, way, to, get, on, wilt, s, side, that, relationship, was, doomed, from, the, start, chamberlain, experienced, an, often, frustrating, season, van, breda, kolff, benched, him, several, times, which, never, happened, before, in, his, career, in, mid, season, chamberlain, a, perennial, scoring, champion, had, two, games, in, which, he, scored, only, six, and, then, two, points, playing, through, his, problems, chamberlain, averaged, 20, 5, points, and, 21, 1, rebounds, a, game, that, season, cooke, was, pleased, because, ticket, sales, went, up, by, 11, since, acquiring, chamberlain, in, the, playoffs, the, lakers, defeated, 4, 2, chamberlain, s, old, club, the, san, francisco, warriors, after, losing, the, first, two, games, then, defeated, the, atlanta, hawks, and, then, played, chamberlain, s, rivals, russell, s, boston, celtics, going, into, the, nba, finals, as, 3, to, 1, favorites, the, lakers, won, the, first, two, games, but, lost, the, next, two, chamberlain, was, criticized, as, a, non, factor, in, the, series, being, neutralized, by, russell, with, little, effort, in, game, 4, sam, jones, again, hit, a, clutch, shot, this, time, off, the, wrong, foot, in, game, 5, chamberlain, scored, 13, points, and, grabbed, 31, rebounds, leading, los, angeles, to, a, 117, 104, win, in, game, 6, chamberlain, recorded, 18, rebounds, and, 4, assists, but, only, 8, points, and, the, celtics, won, 99, 90, cherry, criticized, his, performance, saying, if, chamberlain, had, come, up, big, and, put, up, a, normal, 30, point, scoring, night, the, lakers, would, have, probably, won, their, first, championship, in, los, angeles, in, game, 7, cooke, put, up, thousands, of, balloons, in, the, rafters, of, the, forum, in, anticipation, of, a, lakers, win, motivating, the, celtics, in, game, 7, the, lakers, trailed, 91, 76, after, three, quarters, but, later, rallied, chamberlain, twisted, his, knee, after, a, rebound, and, had, to, be, replaced, by, counts, with, three, minutes, to, go, the, lakers, trailed, 103, 102, but, they, committed, costly, turnovers, and, lost, the, game, 108, 106, this, came, despite, a, triple, double, from, west, who, had, 42, points, 13, rebounds, and, 12, assists, and, became, the, only, player, in, nba, history, to, be, named, finals, mvp, despite, being, on, the, losing, team, after, the, game, many, wondered, why, chamberlain, sat, out, the, final, six, minutes, at, the, time, of, his, final, substitution, chamberlain, had, scored, 18, points, hitting, seven, of, his, eight, shots, and, grabbed, 27, rebounds, significantly, more, than, the, 10, points, of, counts, on, 4, of, 13, shooting, among, others, russell, did, not, believe, chamberlain, s, injury, was, grave, and, accused, him, of, being, a, malingerer, stating, any, injury, short, of, a, broken, leg, or, a, broken, back, is, not, enough, in, spite, of, their, earlier, quarrels, van, breda, kolff, came, to, chamberlain, s, defense, saying, the, often, maligned, chamberlain, hardly, was, able, to, move, by, the, end, van, breda, kolff, was, perceived, as, pig, headed, for, benching, chamberlain, and, soon, resigned, as, lakers, coach, cherry, commented, some, journalists, reported, game, 7, destroyed, two, careers, wilt, s, because, he, wouldn, t, take, over, and, van, breda, kolff, because, he, wouldn, t, give, in, chamberlain, began, the, 1969, 70, nba, season, under, new, coach, joe, mullaney, strongly, averaging, 32, 2, points, and, 20, 6, rebounds, per, game, over, the, first, nine, games, of, the, season, during, the, ninth, game, he, had, a, serious, knee, injury, suffering, a, rupture, of, the, patellar, tendon, at, the, base, of, his, right, kneecap, and, he, missed, several, months, before, appearing, in, the, final, three, games, of, the, 82, game, regular, season, the, first, season, he, failed, to, reach, 20, rebounds, per, game, owing, to, his, strong, start, he, still, put, up, a, season, average, 27, 3, points, 18, 4, rebounds, and, 4, 1, assists, per, game, the, lakers, again, made, the, playoffs, in, the, first, round, the, lakers, defeated, goodrich, connie, hawkins, and, the, phoenix, suns, in, a, seven, game, series, the, lakers, swept, the, atlanta, hawks, in, the, second, round, before, ultimately, reaching, the, nba, finals, where, they, played, against, the, new, york, knicks, which, included, future, hall, of, famers, willis, reed, dave, debusschere, bill, bradley, and, walt, frazier, having, lost, lateral, speed, due, to, his, injury, chamberlain, was, often, too, slow, to, block, reed, s, preferred, high, post, jump, shots, the, knicks, won, game, 1, 124, 112, and, reed, scored, 37, points, in, game, 2, chamberlain, scored, 19, points, grabbed, 24, rebounds, and, blocked, reed, s, shot, in, the, final, seconds, leading, the, lakers, to, a, 105, 103, win, in, game, 3, west, hit, a, 60, foot, 18, m, shot, at, the, buzzer, to, tie, the, game, at, 102, but, the, knicks, won, in, overtime, 111, 108, in, game, 4, chamberlain, scored, 18, points, and, grabbed, 25, rebounds, helping, tie, the, series, at, 2, in, game, 5, with, the, knicks, trailing, by, more, than, nine, points, reed, pulled, his, thigh, muscle, and, seemed, to, be, out, for, the, series, by, convention, chamberlain, should, have, dominated, against, little, used, knicks, backup, centers, nate, bowman, and, bill, hosket, jr, or, forwards, bradley, and, debusschere, who, gave, up, more, than, 6, in, 150, mm, against, him, instead, the, lakers, gave, away, their, 13, point, halftime, lead, succumbed, to, the, aggressive, knicks, defense, and, committed, 19, second, half, turnovers, chamberlain, and, west, the, lakers, two, main, scorers, shot, the, ball, only, thrice, and, twice, respectively, in, the, entire, second, half, the, lakers, lost, 107, 100, in, what, was, called, one, of, the, greatest, comebacks, in, nba, finals, history, in, game, 6, chamberlain, scored, 45, points, grabbed, 27, rebounds, and, almost, single, handedly, equalized, the, series, in, a, 135, 113, lakers, win, with, reed, out, the, knicks, seemed, doomed, prior, to, game, 7, in, new, york, city, however, the, hero, of, game, 7, was, reed, who, hobbled, up, court, scored, the, first, four, points, and, inspired, his, team, to, one, of, the, most, famous, playoff, upsets, of, all, time, the, knicks, led, by, 27, at, halftime, and, despite, chamberlain, scoring, 21, points, lakers, had, their, third, consecutive, loss, in, game, 7, chamberlain, was, criticized, for, his, inability, to, dominate, his, injured, counterpart, but, according, to, cherry, chamberlain, s, feat, coming, back, from, a, career, threatening, injury, was, too, quickly, forgotten, in, the, 1970, 71, nba, season, the, lakers, signed, gail, goodrich, who, had, returned, from, the, suns, chamberlain, averaged, 20, 7, points, 18, 2, rebounds, and, 4, 3, assists, he, once, again, led, the, nba, in, rebounding, and, the, lakers, won, the, pacific, division, title, when, hall, of, fame, detroit, pistons, center, bob, lanier, who, was, 6, ft, 11, in, 2, 11, m, and, 250, lb, 110, kg, as, a, rookie, was, asked, about, the, most, memorable, moment, of, his, career, lanier, answered, when, wilt, chamberlain, lifted, me, up, and, moved, me, like, a, coffee, cup, so, he, could, get, a, favorable, position, after, losing, baylor, to, an, achilles, tendon, rupture, that, effectively, ended, his, career, and, especially, after, losing, west, after, a, knee, injury, the, lakers, were, seen, as, underdogs, in, the, playoffs, against, the, milwaukee, bucks, of, alcindor, freshly, crowned, mvp, and, the, veteran, hall, of, fame, guard, robertson, whom, they, played, in, the, western, conference, finals, after, winning, the, regular, season, with, 66, wins, the, bucks, were, seen, as, favorites, against, the, depleted, lakers, many, pundits, were, looking, forward, to, the, matchup, between, the, 34, year, old, chamberlain, and, the, 24, year, old, alcindor, in, game, 1, alcindor, outscored, chamberlain, 32, 22, and, the, bucks, won, 106, 85, in, game, 2, the, bucks, won, again, despite, chamberlain, scoring, 26, points, four, more, than, his, milwaukee, counterpart, prior, to, game, 3, the, lakers, situation, worsened, when, west, s, stand, in, erickson, underwent, an, appendectomy, and, was, out, for, the, season, with, rookie, jim, mcmillian, easing, the, scoring, pressure, chamberlain, scored, 24, points, and, grabbed, 24, rebounds, in, a, 118, 107, victory, but, the, bucks, defeated, the, lakers, 117, 94, in, game, 4, to, take, a, 3, 1, series, lead, milwaukee, ended, the, series, at, home, with, a, 116, 98, victory, in, game, 5, although, chamberlain, lost, he, was, lauded, for, holding, his, own, against, mvp, alcindor, who, was, 10, years, younger, and, healthy, after, the, playoffs, chamberlain, challenged, heavyweight, boxing, legend, muhammad, ali, to, a, fight, chamberlain, trained, with, cus, d, amato, for, the, 15, round, bout, set, to, take, place, on, july, 26, 1971, in, the, houston, astrodome, ali, refused, to, be, intimidated, issuing, his, typical, public, boasts, this, time, of, timber, and, the, tree, will, fall, in, 1965, chamberlain, consulted, his, father, who, had, seen, ali, fight, and, advised, chamberlain, against, it, cooke, offered, chamberlain, a, record, setting, contract, on, the, condition, he, agreed, to, give, up, what, cooke, termed, this, boxing, foolishness, chamberlain, ultimately, used, a, contractual, escape, joe, frazier, gave, ali, his, first,

sharman, as, head, coach, sharman, introduced, morning, shoot, arounds, in, which, the, perennial, latecomer, chamberlain, regularly, participated, in, contrast, to, earlier, years, with, schayes, and, transformed, him, into, a, defensive, minded, low, scoring, post, defender, in, the, style, of, russell, sharman, told, chamberlain, to, use, his, rebounding, and, passing, skills, to, quickly, initiate, fastbreaks, to, his, teammates, while, no, longer, being, the, main, scorer, chamberlain, was, named, the, lakers, new, captain, after, rupturing, his, achilles, tendon, perennial, captain, baylor, retired, and, was, replaced, with, chamberlain, initially, sharman, wanted, chamberlain, and, west, to, share, this, duty, but, west, declined, stating, he, was, injury, prone, and, wanted, to, concentrate, on, the, game, chamberlain, accepted, his, new, roles, and, posted, an, all, time, low, 14, 8, points, per, game, but, also, 19, 2, rebounds, per, game, and, led, the, league, with, a, 649, field, goal, percentage, powered, by, his, defensive, presence, the, lakers, had, an, unprecedented, 33, game, winning, streak, leading, to, a, then, record, 69, wins, in, the, regular, season, according, to, flynn, robinson, after, the, record, setting, streak, lakers, owner, cooke, sought, to, reward, each, of, his, players, who, may, have, been, expecting, a, trip, to, hawaii, with, a, 5, pen, set, in, response, chamberlain, had, everybody, put, the, pens, in, the, middle, of, the, floor, and, stepped, on, them, in, the, playoffs, the, lakers, defeated, the, chicago, bulls, then, played, against, the, milwaukee, bucks, who, were, led, by, young, center, and, regular, season, mvp, kareem, abdul, jabbar, formerly, lew, alcindor, life, called, the, matchup, between, chamberlain, and, abdul, jabbar, the, greatest, matchup, in, all, sports, chamberlain, helped, the, lakers, defeat, abdul, jabbar, and, the, bucks, in, six, games, and, he, was, lauded, for, his, performance, in, game, 6, which, the, lakers, won, 104, 100, after, trailing, by, 10, points, in, the, fourth, quarter, chamberlain, scored, 24, points, grabbed, 22, rebounds, played, all, 48,

in, overtime, proving, wrong, those, who, said, he, only, played, for, his, own, statistics, he, also, scored, a, game, high, 27, points, and, at, one, point, fell, on, his, right, hand, and, was,

1973, the, san, diego, conquistadors, a, member, of, the, nba, rival, league, aba, signed, chamberlain, as, a, player, coach, for, a, 600, 000, salary, according, to, chamberlain, part, of, the, reason, for, leaving, the, lakers, was, his, belief, he, had, the, right, to, renegotiate, his, contract, after, winning, the, 1971, 72, nba, championship, and, was, upset, the, lakers, did, not, contact, him, until, september, 1972, before, which, they, were, trying, to, acquire, ucla, star, center, bill, walton, who, ultimately, decided, to, return, to, school, for, the, 1972, 73, season, the, lakers, sued, chamberlain, and, prevented, him, from, playing, for, the, conquistadors, because, he, still, owed, the, lakers, the, option, year, of, his, contract, according, to, the, two, year, contract, chamberlain, had, signed, prior, to, the, 1971, 72, season, if, he, failed, to, sign, and, mail, back, his, next, contract, his, contract, with, the, lakers, would, be, deemed, to, be, renewed, the, lakers, said, they, mailed, chamberlain, a, new, contract, in, july, 1973, but, chamberlain, did, not, sign, it, so, the, old, contract, should, be, deemed, to, have, been, renewed, for, the, 1973, 74, season, on, october, 10, 1973, the, opening, day, of, the, conquistadors, season, a, judge, ruled, chamberlain, could, coach, the, conquistadors, but, could, not, play, for, any, team,

between, chamberlain, and, russell, is, often, simplified, to, one, between, a, great, player, chamberlain, with, a, player, who, makes, his, team, great, russell, an, individualist, against, a, team, player, chamberlain, would, say, boston, did, not, rely, on, russell, s, scoring, and, that, russell, could, concentrate, on, defense, and, rebounding, chamberlain, went, on, i, ve, got, to, hit, forty, points, or, so, or, this, team, is, in, trouble, i, must, score, understand, after, that, i, play, defense, and, get, the, ball, off, the, boards, i, try, to, do, them, all, best, i, can, but,

second, person, whom, he, was, ordered, to, inform, while, previously, friends, after, russell, criticized, chamberlain, for, his, performance, during, game, 7, of, the, 1969, nba, finals, the, two, men, did, not, speak, for, two, decades, russell, privately, apologized, to, chamberlain, and, later, publicly, apologized, in, a, 1997, joint, interview, with, bob, costas, the, 1969, nba, finals, is, arguably, the, biggest, stain, on, chamberlain, s, career, supporters, of, chamberlain, said, russell, won, more, games, because, he, had, better, skilled, teammates, in, the, finals, however, chamberlain, s, team, was, favored, and, lost, although, chamberlain, accumulated, some, of, the, most, impressive, statistics, in, the, history, of, professional, sports, he, was, often, called, selfish, and, a, loser, because, he, won, only, two, nba, championships, and, lost, seven, out, of, eight, playoff, series, against, bill, russell, s, celtics, teams, frank, deford, of, espn, said, chamberlain, was, caught, in, a, no, win, situation, if, you, win, everybody, says, well, look, at, him, he, s, that, big, if, you, lose, everybody, says, how, could, he, lose, a, guy, that, size, quoting, coach, alex, hannum, s, explanation, of, his, situation, chamberlain, often, said, nobody, roots, for, goliath, rick, barry, wrote, i, ll, say, what, most, players, feel, which, is, that, wilt, is, a, loser, he, is, terrible, in, big, games, he, knows, he, is, going, to, lose, and, be, blamed, for, the, loss, so, he, dreads, it, and, you, can, see, it, in, his, eyes, and, anyone, who, has, ever, played, with, him, will, agree, with, me, regardless, of, whether, they, would, admit, it, publicly, when, it, comes, down, to, the, closing, minutes, of, a, tough, game, an, important, game, he, doesn, t, want, the, ball, he, doesn, t, want, any, part, of, the, pressure, it, is, at, these, times, that, greatness, is, determined, and, wilt, doesn, t, have, it, there, is, no, way, you, can, compare, him, to, a, pro, like, a, bill, russell, or, a, jerry, west, these, are, clutch, competitors, chamberlain, s, main, weakness, was, his, poor, free, throw, shooting, a, 511, career, average, the, third, lowest, in, nba, history, with, a, low, of, 380, over, the, 1967, 68, season, chamberlain, later, said, he, was, a, psycho, case, in, this, matter, much, like, later, center, shaquille, o, neal, chamberlain, would, be, intentionally, fouled, and, was, a, target, of, criticism, because, of, it, many, suggestions, were, offered, he, shot, them, underhanded, one, handed, two, handed, from, the, side, of, the, circle, from, well, behind, the, line, and, banked, it, in, coach, hannum, once, suggested, chamberlain, shoot, his, fadeaway, jumper, as, a, free, throw, but, chamberlain, feared, drawing, more, attention, to, his, main, failing, despite, his, foul, line, problems, chamberlain, set, the, nba, record, which, was, later, equaled, by, adrian, dantley, for, the, most, free, throws, made, 28, using, the, underhand, technique, in, a, regular, season, game, in, his, 1962, 100, point, game, chamberlain, later, said, he, was, too, embarrassed, by, the, underhand, technique, to, continue, using, it, although, it, consistently, gave, him, better, results, chamberlain, stated, he, intentionally, missed, free, throws, so, a, teammate, could, get, the, rebound, and, score, two, points, instead, of, one, chamberlain, was, the, first, big, earner, of, basketball, upon, entering, the, nba, he, immediately, became, the, highest, paid, player, chamberlain, was, basketball, s, first, player, to, earn, at, least, 100, 000, a, year, and, he, earned, an, unprecedented, 1, 5, million, during, his, lakers, years, as, a, philadelphia, 76er, he,

playboy, mansion, where, he, regularly, held, parties, and, lived, his, later, notorious, sex, life, this, was, also, helped, by, the, fact, chamberlain, was, a, near, insomniac, who, often, skipped,

collected, women, swedish, olympic, high, jumper, annette, t, nnander, who, met, chamberlain, when, he, was, 40, and, she, was, 19, said, he, was, a, pick, up, artist, who, was, extremely, confident, yet, respectful, saying, i, think, wilt, hit, on, everything, that, moved, he, never, was, bad, or, rude, los, angeles, times, columnist, david, shaw, said, chamberlain, was, rude, and, sexist, toward, his, own, date, as, he, usually, was, during, a, dinner, with, shaw, and, his, wife, he, added, at, one, point, chamberlain, left, the, table, to, get, the, telephone, number, of, an, attractive, woman, at, a, nearby, table, in, chamberlain, s, second, book, a, view, from, above, he, claimed, to, have, had, sex, with, 20, 000, women, according, to, his, contemporary, rod, roddewig, chamberlain, documented, his, love, life, using, a, day, timer, every, time, chamberlain, had, sex, with, a, different, woman, he, put, a, check, in, his, day, timer, over, a, ten, day, period, there, were, 23, checks, in, the, book, a, rate, of, 2, 3, women, per, day, chamberlain, halved, that, number, to, be, conservative, and, to, correct, for, degrees, of, variation, he, then, multiplied, that, number, by, the, number, of, days, he, had, been, alive, and, subtracted, 15, years, giving, him, the, 20, 000, number, in, response, to, public, backlash, regarding, his, promiscuity, chamberlain, later, said, the, point, of, using, the, number, was, to, show, that, sex, was, a, great, part, of, my, life, as, basketball, was, a, great, part, of, my, life, that, s, the, reason, why, i, was, single, in, a, 1999, interview, shortly, before, his, death, chamberlain, regretted, not, having, explained, the, sexual, climate, at, the, time, of, his, promiscuity, and, warned, other, men, who, admired, him, for, it, saying, with, all, of, you, men, out, there, who, think, that, having, a, thousand, different, ladies, is, pretty, cool, i, have, learned, in, my, life, i, ve, found, out, that, having, one, woman, a, thousand, different, times, is, much, more, satisfying, chamberlain, also, said, he, never, came, close, to, marrying, and, had, no, intention, of, raising, any, children, in,

concerned, russell, s, electric, trains, as, the, championship, count, became, increasingly, lopsided, the, relationship, deteriorated, and, became, hostile, after, russell, accused, chamberlain, of, copping, out, in, game, 7, of, the, 1969, nba, finals, the, two, reconciled, after, two, decades, but, chamberlain, maintained, a, level, of, bitterness, regretted, he, had, not, been, more, physical,
