of, horowitz, but, there, were, only, three, janis, turini, who, i, brought, to, the, stage, and, graffman, if, someone, else, claims, it, it, s, not, true, i, had, some, who, played, for, me, for, four, months, once, a, week, i, stopped, work, with, them, because, they, did, not, progress, plaskin, remarks, the, fact, that, horowitz, disavowed, most, of, his, students, and, blurred, the, facts, regarding, their, periods, of, study, says, something, about, the, erratic, nature, of, his, personality, during, that, period, horowitz, returned, to, coaching, in, the, 1980s, working, with, murray, perahia, who, already, had, an, established, career, and, eduardus, halim, in, 1933, in, a, civil, ceremony, horowitz, married, wanda, toscanini, arturo, toscanini, s, daughter, although, horowitz, was, jewish, and, wanda, was, catholic, this, was, not, an, issue, because, neither, of, them, was, religiously, observant, because, wanda, knew, no, russian, and, horowitz, knew, very, little, italian, their, primary, language, was, french, horowitz, was, close, to, his, wife, who, was, one, of, the, few, people, from, whom, horowitz, would, accept, a, critique, of, his, playing, and, she,

despite, his, marriage, there, were, persistent, rumors, of, horowitz, s, homosexuality, arthur, rubinstein, said, of, horowitz, that, veryone, knew, and, accepted, him, as, a, homosexual, david, dubal, wrote, that, in, his, years, with, horowitz, there, was, no, evidence, that, the, octogenarian, was, sexually, active, but, that, there, was, no, doubt, he, was, powerfully, attracted, to, the, male, body, and, was, most, likely, often, sexually, frustrated, throughout, his, life, dubal, felt, that, horowitz, sublimated, a, strong, instinctual, sexuality, into, a, powerful, erotic, undercurrent, communicated, in, his, playing, horowitz, who, denied, being, homosexual, once, joked, here, are, three, kinds, of, pianists, jewish, pianists, homosexual, pianists, and, bad, pianists, in, an, article, in, the, new, york, times, in, september, 2013, kenneth, leedom, an, assistant, of, horowitz, for, five, years, before, 1955, said, he, had, secretly, been, horowitz, s, lover, we, had, a, wonderful, life, together, he, was, a, difficult, man, to, say, the, least, he, had, an, anger, in, him, that, was, unbelievable, the, number, of, meals, i, ve, had, thrown, on, the, floor, or, in, my, lap, he, d, pick, up, the, tablecloth, and, just, pull, it, off, the, table, and, all, the, food, would, go, flying, he, had, tantrums, a, lot, but, then, he, was, calm, and, sweet, very, sweet, very, lovable, and, he, really, adored, me, in, the, 1940s, horowitz, began, seeing, a, psychiatrist, in, an, attempt, to, alter, his, sexual, orientation, in, the, 1960s, and, again, in, the, 1970s, the, pianist, underwent, electroshock, treatment, for, depression, not, long, before, horowitz, died, he, called, gelb, and, told, him, he, was, like, family, now, and, he, didn, t, have, to, call, him, mr, horowitz, he, could, call, him, maestro, in, 1982, horowitz, began, using, prescribed, antidepressant, medications, there, are, reports, that, he, was, drinking, as, well, his, playing, underwent, a, perceptible, decline, during, this, period, with, his, 1983, performances, in, the, united, states, and, japan, marred, by, memory, lapses, and, a, loss, of, physical, control, hidekazu, yoshida, japanese, critic, likened, horowitz, to, a, cracked, rare, gorgeous, antique, vase, he, stopped, playing, in, public, for, two, years, in, 1985, horowitz, no, longer, taking, medication, or,

in, many, of, his, later, performances, although, still, capable, of, remarkable, technical, feats, he, substituted, finesse, and, coloration, for, bravura, many, critics, including, harold, c, schonberg, and, richard, dyer, felt, that, his, post, 1985, performances, and, recordings, were, the, best, of, his, later, years, in, 1986, horowitz, announced, that, he, would, return, to, the, soviet, union, for, the, first, time, since, 1925, to, give, recitals, in, moscow, and, leningrad, in, the, new, atmosphere, of, communication, and, understanding, between, the, ussr, and, the, us, these, concerts, were, seen, as, events, of, political, as, well, as, musical, significance, most, of, the, tickets, for, the, moscow, concert, were, reserved, for, the, soviet, elite, and, few, sold, to, the, general, public, this, resulted, in, a, number, of, moscow, conservatory, students, crashing, the, concert, which, was, audible, to, viewers, of, the, internationally, televised, recital, the, moscow, concert, was, released, on, a, compact, disc, titled, horowitz, in, moscow, which, reigned, at, the, top, of, billboard, s, classical, music, charts, for, over, a, year, it, was, also, released, on, vhs, and, eventually, dvd, the, concert, was, also, widely, seen, on, a, special, edition, of, cbs, news, sunday, morning, with, charles, kuralt, reporting, from, moscow, following, the,

life, horowitz, died, on, november, 5, 1989, in, new, york, city, of, a, heart, attack, aged, 86, he, was, buried, in, the, toscanini, family, tomb, in, the, cimitero, monumentale, milan, italy, horowitz, is, best, known, for, his, performances, of, the, romantic, piano, repertoire, many, consider, horowitz, s, first, recording, of, the, liszt, sonata, in, b, minor, in, 1932, to, be, the, definitive, reading, of, that, piece, even, after, over, 90, years, and, more, than, 100, performances, committed, to, disc, by, other, pianists, other, pieces, with, which, he, was, closely, associated, were, scriabin, s, tude, in, d, sharp, minor, chopin, s, ballade, no, 1, and, many, rachmaninoff, miniatures, including, polka, de, w, r, horowitz, was, acclaimed, for, his, recordings, of, the, rachmaninoff, piano, concerto, no, 3, and, his, performance, before, rachmaninoff, awed, the, composer, who, proclaimed, he, swallowed, it, whole, he, had, the, courage, the, intensity, the, daring, horowitz, was, also, known, for, his, performances, of, quieter, more, intimate, works, including, schumann, s, kinderszenen, scarlatti, s, keyboard, sonatas, keyboard, sonatas, by, clementi, and, several, mozart, and, haydn, sonatas, his, recordings, of, scarlatti, and, clementi, are, particularly, prized, and, he, is, credited, with, having, helped, revive, interest, in, the, two, composers, whose, works, had, been, seldom, performed, or, recorded, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, during, world, war, ii, horowitz, championed, contemporary, russian, music, giving, the, american, premieres, of, prokofiev, s, piano, sonatas, nos, 6, 7, and, 8, the, so, called, war, sonatas, and, kabalevsky, s, piano, sonatas, nos, 2, and, 3, horowitz, also, premiered, the, piano, sonata, and, excursions, of, samuel, barber, he, was, known, for, his, versions, of, several, of, liszt, s, hungarian, rhapsodies, the, second, rhapsody, was, recorded, in, 1953, during, horowitz, s, 25th, anniversary, concert, at, carnegie, hall, and, he, said, it, was, the, most, difficult, of, his, arrangements, horowitz, s, transcriptions, of, note, include, his, composition, variations, on, a, theme, from, carmen, and, the, stars, and, stripes, forever, by, john, philip, sousa, the, latter, became, a, favorite, with, audiences, who, would, anticipate, its, performance, as, an, encore, transcriptions, aside, horowitz, was, not, opposed, to, altering, the, text, of, compositions, to, improve, what, he, considered, unpianistic, writing, or, structural, clumsiness, in, 1940, with, the, composer, s, consent, horowitz, created, his, own, performance, edition, of, rachmaninoff, s, second, piano, sonata, from, the, 1913, original, and, 1931, revised, versions, which, pianists, including, ruth, laredo, and, h, l, ne, grimaud, have, used, he, substantially, rewrote, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, to, make, the, work, more, effective, on, the, grounds, that, mussorgsky, was, not, a, pianist, and, did, not, understand, the, possibilities, of, the, instrument, horowitz, also, altered, short, passages, in, some, works, such, as, substituting, interlocking, octaves, for, chromatic, scales, in, chopin, s, scherzo, in, b, minor, this, was, in, marked, contrast, to, many, pianists, of, the, post, 19th, century, era, who, considered, the, composer, s, text, sacrosanct, living, composers, whose, works, horowitz, played, among, them, rachmaninoff, prokofiev, and, poulenc, invariably, praised, horowitz, s, performances, of, their, work, even, when, he, took, liberties, with, their, scores, horowitz, s, interpretations, were, well, received, by, concert, audiences, but, not, by, some, critics, virgil, thomson, was, consistently, critical, of, horowitz, as, a, master, of, distortion, and, exaggeration, in, his, reviews, appearing, in, the, new, york, herald, tribune, horowitz, claimed, to, take, thomson, s, remarks, as, complimentary, saying, that, michelangelo, and, el, greco, were, also, masters, of, distortion, in, the, 1980, edition, of, grove, s, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, michael, steinberg, wrote, that, horowitz, illustrates, that, an, astounding, instrumental, gift, carries, no, guarantee, about, musical, understanding, new, york, times, music, critic, harold, c, schonberg, countered, that, reviewers, such, as, thomson, and, steinberg, were, unfamiliar, with, 19th, century, performance, practices, that, informed, horowitz, s, musical, approach, many, pianists, such, as, martha, argerich, and, maurizio, pollini, hold, horowitz, in, high, regard, and, the, pianist, friedrich, gulda, referred, to, horowitz, as, the, super, god, of, the, piano, horowitz, s, style, frequently, involved, vast, dynamic, contrasts, with, overwhelming, double, fortissimos, followed, by, sudden, delicate, pianissimos, he, was, able, to, produce, an, extraordinary, volume, of, sound, from, the, piano, without, producing, a, harsh, tone, he, elicited, an, exceptionally, wide, range, of, tonal, color, and, his, taut, precise, attack, was, noticeable, even, in, his, renditions, of, technically, undemanding, pieces, such, as, the, chopin, mazurkas, he, is, known, for, his, octave, technique, he, could, play, precise, passages, in, octaves, extraordinarily, quickly, when, asked, by, the, pianist, tedd, joselson, how, he, practiced, octaves, horowitz, gave, a, demonstration, and, joselson, reported, he, practiced, them, exactly, as, we, were, all, taught, to, do, music, critic, and, biographer, harvey, sachs, submitted, that, horowitz, may, have, been, the, beneficiary, and, perhaps, also, the, victim, of, an, extraordinary, central, nervous, system, and, an, equally, great, sensitivity, to, tone, color, oscar, levant, in, his, book, the, memoirs, of, an, amnesiac, wrote, that, horowitz, s, octaves, were, brilliant, accurate, and, etched, out, like, bullets, he, asked, horowitz, whether, he, shipped, them, ahead, or, carried, them, with, him, on, tour, horowitz, s, hand, position, was, unusual, in, that, the, palm, was, often, below, the, level, of, the, key, surface, he, frequently, played, chords, with, straight, fingers, and, the, little, finger, of, his, right, hand, was, often, curled, up, until, it, needed, to, play, a, note, to, harold, c, schonberg, it, was, like, a, strike, of, a, cobra, for, all, the, excitement, of, his, playing, horowitz, rarely, raised, his, hands, higher, than, the, piano, s, fallboard, byron, janis, one, of, horowitz, s, students, said, that, horowitz, tried, to, teach, him, that, technique, but, it, didn, t, work, for, him, horowitz, s, body, was, immobile, and, his, face, seldom, reflected, anything, other, than, intense, concentration, horowitz, preferred, to, perform, on, sunday, afternoons, as, he, felt, audiences, were, better, rested, and, more, attentive, than, on, weekday, evenings, grammy,
