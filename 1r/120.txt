studio, his, close, friend, mile, schuffenecker, a, former, stockbroker, who, also, aspired, to, become, an, artist, lived, close, by, gauguin, showed, paintings, in, impressionist, exhibitions, held, in, 1881, and, 1882, earlier, a, sculpture, of, his, son, mile, had, been, the, only, sculpture, in, the, 4th, impressionist, exhibition, of, 1879, his, paintings, received, dismissive, reviews, although, several, of, them, such, as, the, market, gardens, of, vaugirard, are, now, highly, regarded, in, 1882, the, stock, market, crashed, and, the, art, market, contracted, paul, durand, ruel, the, impressionists, primary, art, dealer, was, especially, affected, by, the, crash, and, for, a, period, of, time, stopped, buying, pictures, from, painters, such, as, gauguin, gauguin, s, earnings, contracted, sharply, and, over, the, next, two, years, he, slowly, formulated, his, plans, to, become, a, full, time, artist, the, following, two, summers, he, painted, with, pissarro, and, occasionally, paul, c, zanne, in, october, 1883, he, wrote, to, pissarro, saying, that, he, had, decided, to, make, his, living, from, painting, at, all, costs, and, asked, for, his, help, which, pissarro, at, first, readily, provided, the, following, january, gauguin, moved, with, his, family, to, rouen, where, they, could, live, more, cheaply, and, where, he, thought, he, had, discerned, opportunities, when, visiting, pissarro, there, the, previous, summer, however, the, venture, proved, unsuccessful, and, by, the, end, of, the, year, mette, and, the, children, moved, to, copenhagen, gauguin, following, shortly, after, in, november, 1884, bringing, with, him, his, art, collection, which, subsequently, remained, in, copenhagen, life, in, copenhagen, proved, equally, difficult, and, their, marriage, grew, strained, at, mette, s, urging, supported, by, her, family, gauguin, returned, to, paris, the, following, year, after, a, brief, period, in, italy, spent, in, the, small, towns, of, san, salvo, and, ururi, gauguin, returned, to, paris, in, june, 1885, accompanied, by, his, six, year, old, son, clovis, the, other, children, remained, with, mette, in, copenhagen, where, they, had, the, support, of, family, and, friends, while, mette, herself, was, able, to, get, work, as, a, translator, and, french, teacher, gauguin, initially, found, it, difficult, to, re, enter, the, art, world, in, paris, and, spent, his, first, winter, back, in, real, poverty, obliged, to, take, a, series, of, menial, jobs, clovis, eventually, fell, ill, and, was, sent, to, a, boarding, school, gauguin, s, sister, marie, providing, the, funds, during, this, first, year, gauguin, produced, very, little, art, he, exhibited, 19, paintings, and, a, wood, relief, at, the, eighth, and, last, impressionist, exhibition, in, may, 1886, most, of, these, paintings, were, earlier, work, from, rouen, or, copenhagen, and, there, was, nothing, really, novel, in, the, few, new, ones, although, his, baigneuses, dieppe, women, bathing, introduced, what, was, to, become, a, recurring, motif, the, woman, in, the, waves, nevertheless, f, lix, bracquemond, did, purchase, one, of, his, paintings, this, exhibition, also, established, georges, seurat, as, leader, of, the, avant, garde, movement, in, paris, gauguin, contemptuously, rejected, seurat, s, neo, impressionist, pointillist, technique, and, later, in, the, year, broke, decisively, with, pissarro, who, from, that, point, on, was, rather, antagonistic, towards, gauguin, gauguin, spent, the, summer, of, 1886, in, the, artist, s, colony, of, pont, aven, in, brittany, he, was, attracted, in, the, first, place, because, it, was, cheap, to, live, there, however, he, found, himself, an, unexpected, success, with, the, young, art, students, who, flocked, there, in, the, summer, his, naturally, pugilistic, temperament, he, was, both, an, accomplished, boxer, and, fencer, was, no, impediment, in, the, socially, relaxed, seaside, resort, he, was, remembered, during, that, period, as, much, for, his, outlandish, appearance, as, for, his, art, amongst, these, new, associates, was, charles, laval, who, would, accompany, gauguin, the, following, year, to, panama, and, martinique, that, summer, he, executed, some, pastel, drawings, of, nude, figures, in, the, manner, of, pissarro, and, those, by, degas, exhibited, at, the, 1886, eighth, impressionist, exhibition, he, mainly, painted, landscapes, such, as, la, berg, re, bretonne, the, breton, shepherdess, in, which, the, figure, plays, a, subordinate, role, his, jeunes, bretons, au, bain, young, breton, boys, bathing, introducing, a, theme, he, returned, to, each, time, he, visited, pont, aven, is, clearly, indebted, to, degas, in, its, design, and, bold, use, of, pure, colour, the, naive, drawings, of, the, english, illustrator, randolph, caldecott, used, to, illustrate, a, popular, guide, book, on, brittany, had, caught, the, imagination, of, the, avant, garde, student, artists, at, pont, aven, anxious, to, free, themselves, from, the, conservatism, of, their, academies, and, gauguin, consciously, imitated, them, in, his, sketches, of, breton, girls, these, sketches, were, later, worked, up, into, paintings, back, in, his, paris, studio, the, most, important, of, these, is, four, breton, women, which, shows, a, marked, departure, from, his, earlier, impressionist, style, as, well, as, incorporating, something, of, the, naive, quality, of, caldecott, s, illustration, exaggerating, features, to, the, point, of, caricature, gauguin, along, with, mile, bernard, charles, laval, mile, schuffenecker, and, many, others, re, visited, pont, aven, after, his, travels, in, panama, and, martinique, the, bold, use, of, pure, colour, and, symbolist, choice, of, subject, matter, distinguish, what, is, now, called, the, pont, aven, school, disappointed, with, impressionism, gauguin, felt, that, traditional, european, painting, had, become, too, imitative, and, lacked, symbolic, depth, by, contrast, the, art, of, africa, and, asia, seemed, to, him, full, of, mystic, symbolism, and, vigour, there, was, a, vogue, in, europe, at, the, time, for, the, art, of, other, cultures, especially, that, of, japan, japonism, he, was, invited, to, participate, in, the, 1889, exhibition, organized, by, les, xx, under, the, influence, of, folk, art, and, japanese, prints, gauguin, s, work, evolved, towards, cloisonnism, a, style, given, its, name, by, the, critic, douard, dujardin, to, describe, mile, bernard, s, method, of, painting, with, flat, areas, of, colour, and, bold, outlines, which, reminded, dujardin, of, the, medieval, cloisonn, enameling, technique, gauguin, was, very, appreciative, of, bernard, s, art, and, of, his, daring, with, the, employment, of, a, style, which, suited, gauguin, in, his, quest, to, express, the, essence, of, the, objects, in, his, art, in, gauguin, s, the, yellow, christ, 1889, often, cited, as, a, quintessential, cloisonnist, work, the, image, was, reduced, to, areas, of, pure, colour, separated, by, heavy, black, outlines, in, such, works, gauguin, paid, little, attention, to, classical, perspective, and, boldly, eliminated, subtle, gradations, of, colour, thereby, dispensing, with, the, two, most, characteristic, principles, of, post, renaissance, painting, his, painting, later, evolved, towards, synthetism, in, which, neither, form, nor, colour, predominate, but, each, has, an, equal, role, in, 1887, gauguin, left, france, along, with, his, friend, another, young, painter, charles, laval, his, dream, was, to, purchase, land, of, his, own, on, the, small, panamanian, island, of, taboga, where, he, stated, he, desired, to, live, on, fish, and, fruit, and, for, nothing, without, anxiety, for, the, day, or, for, the, morrow, by, the, time, he, reached, the, port, city, of, col, n, gauguin, was, out, of, money, and, found, work, as, a, laborer, on, the, french, construction, of, the, panama, canal, during, this, time, gauguin, penned, letters, to, his, wife, mette, lamenting, the, arduous, conditions, i, have, to, dig, from, five, thirty, in, the, morning, to, six, in, the, evening, under, the, tropical, sun, and, rain, he, wrote, at, night, i, am, devoured, by, mosquitoes, meanwhile, laval, had, been, earning, money, by, drawing, portraits, of, canal, officials, work, which, gauguin, detested, since, only, portraits, done, in, a, lewd, manner, would, sell, gauguin, held, a, profound, contempt, for, panama, and, at, one, point, was, arrested, in, panama, city, for, urinating, in, public, marched, across, town, at, gunpoint, gauguin, was, ordered, to, pay, a, fine, of, four, francs, after, discovering, that, land, on, taboga, was, priced, far, beyond, reach, and, after, falling, deathly, ill, on, the, island, where, he, was, subsequently, interned, in, a, yellow, fever, and, malaria, sanatorium, he, decided, to, leave, panama, later, that, same, year, gauguin, and, laval, spent, the, time, from, june, to, november, near, saint, pierre, on, the, caribbean, island, of, martinique, a, french, colony, his, thoughts, and, experiences, during, this, time, are, recorded, in, his, letters, to, his, wife, and, his, artist, friend, emile, schuffenecker, at, the, time, france, had, a, policy, of, repatriation, where, if, a, citizen, became, broke, or, stranded, on, a, french, colony, the, state, would, pay, for, the, boat, ride, back, upon, leaving, panama, protected, by, the, repatriation, policy, gauguin, and, laval, decided, to, disembark, at, the, martinique, port, of, st, pierre, scholars, disagree, on, whether, gauguin, intentionally, or, spontaneously, decided, to, stay, on, the, island, at, first, the, negro, hut, in, which, they, lived, suited, him, and, he, enjoyed, watching, people, in, their, daily, activities, however, the, weather, in, the, summer, was, hot, and, the, hut, leaked, in, the, rain, gauguin, also, suffered, dysentery, and, marsh, fever, while, in, martinique, he, produced, between, 10, and, 20, works, 12, being, the, most, common, estimate, traveled, widely, and, apparently, came, into, contact, with, a, small, community, of, indian, immigrants, a, contact, that, would, later, influence, his, art, through, the, incorporation, of, indian, symbols, during, his, stay, the, writer, lafcadio, hearn, was, also, on, the, island, his, account, provides, an, historical, comparison, to, accompany, gauguin, s, images, gauguin, finished, 11, known, paintings, during, his, stay, in, martinique, many, of, which, seem, to, be, derived, from, his, hut, his, letters, to, schuffenecker, express, an, excitement, about, the, exotic, location, and, natives, represented, in, his, paintings, gauguin, asserted, that, four, of, his, paintings, on, the, island, were, better, than, the, rest, the, works, as, a, whole, are, brightly, coloured, loosely, painted, outdoor, figural, scenes, even, though, his, time, on, the, island, was, short, it, surely, was, influential, he, recycled, some, of, his, figures, and, sketches, in, later, paintings, such, as, the, motif, in, among, the, mangoes, which, is, replicated, on, his, fans, rural, and, indigenous, populations, remained, a, popular, subject, in, gauguin, s, work, after, he, left, the, island, gauguin, s, martinique, paintings, were, exhibited, at, his, colour, merchant, ars, ne, poitier, s, gallery, there, they, were, seen, and, admired, by, vincent, van, gogh, and, his, art, dealer, brother, theo, whose, firm, goupil, cie, had, dealings, with, portier, theo, purchased, three, of, gauguin, s, paintings, for, 900, francs, and, arranged, to, have, them, hung, at, goupil, s, thus, introducing, gauguin, to, wealthy, clients, this, arrangement, with, goupil, s, continued, past, theo, s, death, in, 1891, at, the, same, time, vincent, and, gauguin, became, close, friends, on, vincent, s, part, it, amounted, to, something, akin, to, adulation, and, they, corresponded, together, on, art, a, correspondence, that, was, instrumental, in, gauguin, formulating, his, philosophy, of, art, in, 1888, at, theo, s, instigation, gauguin, and, vincent, spent, nine, weeks, painting, together, at, vincent, s, yellow, house, in, arles, in, the, south, of, france, gauguin, s, relationship, with, vincent, proved, fraught, their, relationship, deteriorated, and, eventually, gauguin, decided, to, leave, on, the, evening, of, 23, december, 1888, according, to, a, much, later, account, of, gauguin, s, vincent, confronted, gauguin, with, a, straight, razor, later, the, same, evening, he, cut, off, his, own, left, ear, he, wrapped, the, severed, tissue, in, newspaper, and, handed, it, to, a, woman, who, worked, at, a, brothel, gauguin, and, vincent, had, both, visited, and, asked, her, to, keep, this, object, carefully, in, remembrance, of, me, vincent, was, hospitalized, the, following, day, and, gauguin, left, arles, they, never, saw, each, other, again, but, they, continued, to, correspond, and, in, 1890, gauguin, went, so, far, as, to, propose, they, form, an, artist, studio, in, antwerp, an, 1889, sculptural, self, portrait, jug, in, the, form, of, a, head, appears, to, reference, gauguin, s, traumatic, relationship, with, vincent, gauguin, later, claimed, to, have, been, instrumental, in, influencing, vincent, van, gogh, s, development, as, a, painter, at, arles, while, vincent, did, briefly, experiment, with, gauguin, s, theory, of, painting, from, the, imagination, in, paintings, such, as, memory, of, the, garden, at, etten, it, did, not, suit, him, and, he, quickly, returned, to, painting, from, nature, although, gauguin, made, some, of, his, early, strides, in, the, world, of, art, under, pissarro, edgar, degas, was, gauguin, s, most, admired, contemporary, artist, and, a, great, influence, on, his, work, from, the, beginning, with, his, figures, and, interiors, as, well, as, a, carved, and, painted, medallion, of, singer, val, rie, roumi, he, had, a, deep, reverence, for, degas, artistic, dignity, and, tact, it, was, gauguin, s, healthiest, longest, lasting, friendship, spanning, his, entire, artistic, career, until, his, death, in, addition, to, being, one, of, his, earliest, supporters, including, buying, gauguin, s, work, and, persuading, dealer, paul, durand, ruel, to, do, the, same, there, was, never, a, public, support, for, gauguin, more, unwavering, than, from, degas, gauguin, also, purchased, work, from, degas, in, the, early, to, mid, 1870s, and, his, own, monotyping, predilection, was, probably, influenced, by, degas, advancements, in, the, medium, gauguin, s, durand, ruel, exhibition, in, november, 1893, which, degas, chiefly, organized, received, mixed, reviews, among, the, mocking, were, claude, monet, pierre, auguste, renoir, and, former, friend, pissarro, degas, however, praised, his, work, purchasing, te, faaturuma, and, admiring, the, exotic, sumptuousness, of, gauguin, s, conjured, folklore, in, appreciation, gauguin, presented, degas, with, the, moon, and, the, earth, one, of, the, exhibited, paintings, that, had, attracted, the, most, hostile, criticism, gauguin, s, late, canvas, riders, on, the, beach, two, versions, recalls, degas, horse, pictures, that, he, started, in, the, 1860s, specifically, racetrack, and, before, the, race, testifying, to, his, enduring, effect, on, gauguin, degas, later, purchased, two, paintings, at, gauguin, s, 1895, auction, to, raise, funds, for, his, final, trip, to, tahiti, these, were, vahine, no, te, vi, woman, with, a, mango, and, the, version, gauguin, painted, of, douard, manet, s, olympia, by, 1890, gauguin, had, conceived, the, project, of, making, tahiti, his, next, artistic, destination, a, successful, auction, of, paintings, in, paris, at, the, h, tel, drouot, in, february, 1891, along, with, other, events, such, as, a, banquet, and, a, benefit, concert, provided, the, necessary, funds, the, auction, had, been, greatly, helped, by, a, flattering, review, from, octave, mirbeau, courted, by, gauguin, through, camille, pissarro, after, visiting, his, wife, and, children, in, copenhagen, for, what, turned, out, to, be, the, last, time, gauguin, set, sail, for, tahiti, on, 1, april, 1891, promising, to, return, a, rich, man, and, make, a, fresh, start, his, avowed, intent, was, to, escape, european, civilization, and, everything, that, is, artificial, and, conventional, nevertheless, he, took, care, to, take, with, him, a, collection, of, visual, stimuli, in, the, form, of, photographs, drawings, and, prints, he, spent, the, first, three, months, in, papeete, the, capital, of, the, colony, and, already, much, influenced, by, french, and, european, culture, his, biographer, belinda, thomson, observes, that, he, must, have, been, disappointed, in, his, vision, of, a, primitive, idyll, he, was, unable, to, afford, the, pleasure, seeking, life, style, in, papeete, and, an, early, attempt, at, a, portrait, suzanne, bambridge, was, not, well, liked, he, decided, to, set, up, his, studio, in, mataiea, papeari, some, 45, kilometres, 28, mi, from, papeete, installing, himself, in, a, native, style, bamboo, hut, here, he, executed, paintings, depicting, tahitian, life, such, as, fatata, te, miti, by, the, sea, and, ia, orana, maria, ave, maria, the, latter, to, become, his, most, prized, tahitian, painting, many, of, his, finest, paintings, date, from, this, period, his, first, portrait, of, a, tahitian, model, is, thought, to, be, vahine, no, te, tiare, woman, with, a, flower, the, painting, is, notable, for, the, care, with, which, it, delineates, polynesian, features, he, sent, the, painting, to, his, patron, george, daniel, de, monfreid, a, friend, of, schuffenecker, who, was, to, become, gauguin, s, devoted, champion, in, tahiti, by, late, summer, 1892, this, painting, was, being, displayed, at, goupil, s, gallery, in, paris, art, historian, nancy, mowll, mathews, believes, that, gauguin, s, encounter, with, exotic, sensuality, in, tahiti, so, evident, in, the, painting, was, by, far, the, most, important, aspect, of, his, sojourn, there, he, often, rendered, titles, of, his, works, in, tahitian, some, of, these, titles, however, were, sometimes, very, misconjugated, to, a, point, where, they, were, almost, hard, to, understand, by, native, tahitian, speakers, themselves, gauguin, was, lent, copies, of, jacques, antoine, moerenhout, s, 1837, voyage, aux, les, du, grand, oc, an, and, edmond, de, bovis, 1855, tat, de, la, soci, t, tahitienne, l, arriv, e, des, europ, ens, containing, full, accounts, of, tahiti, s, forgotten, culture, and, religion, gauguin, was, fascinated, by, the, accounts, of, arioi, society, and, their, god, oro, because, these, accounts, contained, no, illustrations, and, the, tahitian, models, had, in, any, case, long, disappeared, he, could, give, free, rein, to, his, imagination, he, executed, some, twenty, paintings, and, a, dozen, woodcarvings, over, the, next, year, the, first, of, these, was, te, aa, no, areois, the, seed, of, the, areoi, representing, oro, s, terrestrial, wife, vairaumati, now, held, by, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, his, illustrated, notebook, of, the, time, ancien, culte, mahorie, is, preserved, in, the, louvre, and, was, published, in, facsimile, form, in, 1951, in, all, gauguin, sent, nine, of, his, paintings, to, monfreid, in, paris, these, were, eventually, exhibited, in, copenhagen, in, a, joint, exhibition, with, the, late, vincent, van, gogh, reports, that, they, had, been, well, received, though, in, fact, only, two, of, the, tahitian, paintings, were, sold, and, his, earlier, paintings, were, unfavourably, compared, with, van, gogh, s, were, sufficiently, encouraging, for, gauguin, to, contemplate, returning, with, some, seventy, others, he, had, completed, he, had, in, any, case, largely, run, out, of, funds, depending, on, a, state, grant, for, a, free, passage, home, in, addition, he, had, some, health, problems, diagnosed, as, heart, problems, by, the, local, doctor, which, mathews, suggests, may, have, been, the, early, signs, of, cardiovascular, syphilis, gauguin, later, wrote, a, travelogue, first, published, 1901, titled, noa, noa, originally, conceived, as, commentary, on, his, paintings, and, describing, his, experiences, in, tahiti, modern, critics, have, suggested, that, the, contents, of, the, book, were, in, part, fantasized, and, plagiarized, in, it, he, revealed, that, he, had, at, this, time, taken, a, 13, year, old, girl, as, native, wife, or, vahine, the, tahitian, word, for, woman, a, marriage, contracted, in, the, course, of, a, single, afternoon, this, was, teha, amana, called, tehura, in, the, travelogue, who, was, pregnant, by, him, by, the, end, of, summer, 1892, teha, amana, was, the, subject, of, several, of, gauguin, s, paintings, including, merahi, metua, no, tehamana, and, the, celebrated, spirit, of, the, dead, watching, as, well, as, a, notable, woodcarving, tehura, now, in, the, mus, e, d, orsay, by, the, end, of, july, 1893, gauguin, had, decided, to, leave, tahiti, and, he, would, never, see, teha, amana, or, their, child, again, even, after, returning, to, the, island, several, years, later, a, digital, catalogue, raisonn, of, the, paintings, from, this, period, was, released, by, the, wildenstein, plattner, institute, in, 2021, in, august, 1893, gauguin, returned, to, france, where, he, continued, to, execute, paintings, on, tahitian, subjects, such, as, mahana, no, atua, day, of, the, god, and, nave, nave, moe, sacred, spring, sweet, dreams, an, exhibition, at, the, durand, ruel, gallery, in, november, 1894, was, a, moderate, success, selling, at, quite, elevated, prices, 11, of, the, 40, paintings, exhibited, he, set, up, an, apartment, at, 6, rue, vercing, torix, on, the, edge, of, the, montparnasse, district, frequented, by, artists, and, began, to, conduct, a, weekly, salon, he, affected, an, exotic, persona, dressing, in, polynesian, costume, and, conducted, a, public, affair, with, a, young, woman, still, in, her, teens, half, indian, half, malayan, known, as, annah, the, javanese, despite, the, moderate, success, of, his, november, exhibition, he, subsequently, lost, durand, ruel, s, patronage, in, circumstances, that, are, not, clear, mathews, characterises, this, as, a, tragedy, for, gauguin, s, career, amongst, other, things, he, lost, the, chance, of, an, introduction, to, the, american, market, the, start, of, 1894, found, him, preparing, woodcuts, using, an, experimental, technique, for, his, proposed, travelogue, noa, noa, he, returned, to, pont, aven, for, the, summer, in, february, 1895, he, attempted, an, auction, of, his, paintings, at, h, tel, drouot, in, paris, similar, to, the, one, of, 1891, but, this, was, not, a, success, the, dealer, ambroise, vollard, however, showed, his, paintings, at, his, gallery, in, march, 1895, but, they, unfortunately, did, not, come, to, terms, at, that, date, he, submitted, a, large, ceramic, sculpture, he, called, oviri, he, had, fired, the, previous, winter, to, the, soci, t, nationale, des, beaux, arts, 1895, salon, opening, in, april, there, are, conflicting, versions, of, how, it, was, received, his, biographer, and, noa, noa, collaborator, the, symbolist, poet, charles, morice, contended, 1920, that, the, work, was, literally, expelled, from, the, exhibition, while, vollard, said, 1937, that, the, work, was, admitted, only, when, chaplet, threatened, to, withdraw, all, his, own, work, in, any, case, gauguin, took, the, opportunity, to, increase, his, public, exposure, by, writing, an, outraged, letter, on, the, state, of, modern, ceramics, to, le, soir, by, this, time, it, had, become, clear, that, he, and, his, wife, mette, were, irrevocably, separated, although, there, had, been, hopes, of, a, reconciliation, they, had, quickly, quarrelled, over, money, matters, and, neither, visited, the, other, gauguin, initially, refused, to, share, any, part, of, a, 13, 000, franc, inheritance, from, his, uncle, isidore, which, he, had, come, into, shortly, after, returning, mette, was, eventually, gifted, 1, 500, francs, but, she, was, outraged, and, from, that, point, on, kept, in, contact, with, him, only, through, schuffenecker, doubly, galling, for, gauguin, as, his, friend, thus, knew, the, true, extent, of, his, betrayal, by, mid, 1895, attempts, to, raise, funds, for, gauguin, s, return, to, tahiti, had, failed, and, he, began, accepting, charity, from, friends, in, june, 1895, eug, ne, carri, re, arranged, a, cheap, passage, back, to, tahiti, and, gauguin, never, saw, europe, again, gauguin, set, out, for, tahiti, again, on, 28, june, 1895, his, return, is, characterised, by, thomson, as, an, essentially, negative, one, his, disillusionment, with, the, paris, art, scene, compounded, by, two, attacks, on, him, in, the, same, issue, of, mercure, de, france, one, by, emile, bernard, the, other, by, camille, mauclair, mathews, remarks, that, his, isolation, in, paris, had, become, so, bitter, that, he, had, no, choice, but, to, try, to, reclaim, his, place, in, tahiti, society, he, arrived, in, september, 1895, and, was, to, spend, the, next, six, years, living, for, the, most, part, an, apparently, comfortable, life, as, an, artist, colon, near, or, at, times, in, papeete, during, this, time, he, was, able, to, support, himself, with, an, increasingly, steady, stream, of, sales, and, the, support, of, friends, and, well, wishers, though, there, was, a, period, of, time, 1898, 1899, when, he, felt, compelled, to, take, a, desk, job, in, papeete, of, which, there, is, not, much, record, he, built, a, spacious, reed, and, thatch, house, at, puna, auia, in, an, affluent, area, ten, miles, east, of, papeete, settled, by, wealthy, families, in, which, he, installed, a, large, studio, sparing, no, expense, jules, agostini, an, acquaintance, of, gauguin, s, and, an, accomplished, amateur, photographer, photographed, the, house, in, 1896, later, a, sale, of, land, obliged, him, to, build, a, new, one, in, the, same, neighbourhood, he, maintained, a, horse, and, trap, so, was, in, a, position, to, travel, daily, to, papeete, to, participate, in, the, social, life, of, the, colony, should, he, wish, he, subscribed, to, the, mercure, de, france, indeed, was, a, shareholder, by, then, france, s, foremost, critical, journal, and, kept, up, an, active, correspondence, with, fellow, artists, dealers, critics, and, patrons, in, paris, during, his, year, in, papeete, and, thereafter, he, played, an, increasing, role, in, local, politics, contributing, abrasively, to, a, local, journal, opposed, to, the, colonial, government, les, gu, pes, the, wasps, that, had, recently, been, formed, and, eventually, edited, his, own, monthly, publication, le, sourire, journal, s, rieux, the, smile, a, serious, newspaper, later, titled, simply, journal, m, chant, a, wicked, newspaper, a, certain, amount, of, artwork, and, woodcuts, from, his, newspaper, survive, in, february, 1900, he, became, the, editor, of, les, gu, pes, itself, for, which, he, drew, a, salary, and, he, continued, as, editor, until, he, left, tahiti, in, september, 1901, the, paper, under, his, editorship, was, noted, for, its, scurrilous, attacks, on, the, governor, and, officialdom, in, general, but, was, not, in, fact, a, champion, of, native, causes, although, perceived, as, such, nevertheless, for, the, first, year, at, least, he, produced, no, paintings, informing, monfreid, that, he, proposed, henceforth, to, concentrate, on, sculpture, few, of, his, wooden, carvings, from, this, period, survive, most, of, them, collected, by, monfreid, thomson, cites, oyez, hui, iesu, christ, on, the, cross, a, wooden, cylinder, half, a, metre, 20, tall, featuring, a, curious, hybrid, of, religious, motifs, the, cylinder, may, have, been, inspired, by, similar, symbolic, carvings, in, brittany, such, as, at, pleumeur, bodou, where, ancient, menhirs, have, been, christianised, by, local, craftsmen, when, he, resumed, painting, it, was, to, continue, his, long, standing, series, of, sexually, charged, nudes, in, paintings, such, as, te, tamari, no, atua, son, of, god, and, o, taiti, nevermore, thomson, observes, a, progression, in, complexity, mathews, notes, a, return, to, christian, symbolism, that, would, have, endeared, him, to, the, colonists, of, the, time, now, anxious, to, preserve, what, was, left, of, native, culture, by, stressing, the, universality, of, religious, principles, in, these, paintings, gauguin, was, addressing, an, audience, amongst, his, fellow, colonists, in, papeete, not, his, former, avant, garde, audience, in, paris, his, health, took, a, decided, turn, for, the, worse, and, he, was, hospitalised, several, times, for, a, variety, of, ailments, while, he, was, in, france, he, had, his, ankle, shattered, in, a, drunken, brawl, on, a, seaside, visit, to, concarneau, the, injury, an, open, fracture, never, healed, properly, then, painful, and, debilitating, sores, that, restricted, his, movement, began, erupting, up, and, down, his, legs, these, were, treated, with, arsenic, gauguin, blamed, the, tropical, climate, and, described, the, sores, as, eczema, but, his, biographers, agree, this, must, have, been, the, progress, of, syphilis, in, april, 1897, he, received, word, that, his, favorite, daughter, aline, had, died, from, pneumonia, this, was, also, the, month, he, learned, he, had, to, vacate, his, house, because, its, land, had, been, sold, he, took, out, a, bank, loan, to, build, a, much, more, extravagant, wooden, house, with, beautiful, views, of, the, mountains, and, sea, but, he, overextended, himself, in, so, doing, and, by, the, end, of, the, year, faced, the, real, prospect, of, his, bank, foreclosing, on, him, failing, health, and, pressing, debts, brought, him, to, the, brink, of, despair, at, the, end, of, the, year, he, completed, his, monumental, where, do, we, come, from, what, are, we, where, are, we, going, which, he, regarded, as, his, masterpiece, and, final, artistic, testament, in, a, letter, to, monfreid, he, explained, that, he, tried, to, kill, himself, after, finishing, it, the, painting, was, exhibited, at, vollard, s, gallery, in, november, the, following, year, along, with, eight, thematically, related, paintings, he, had, completed, by, july, this, was, his, first, major, exhibition, in, paris, since, his, durand, ruel, show, in, 1893, and, it, was, a, decided, success, critics, praising, his, new, serenity, where, do, we, come, from, however, received, mixed, reviews, and, vollard, had, difficulty, selling, it, he, eventually, sold, it, in, 1901, for, 2, 500, francs, about, 10, 000, in, year, 2000, us, dollars, to, gabriel, frizeau, of, which, vollard, s, commission, was, perhaps, as, much, as, 500, francs, georges, chaudet, gauguin, s, paris, dealer, died, in, the, fall, of, 1899, vollard, had, been, buying, gauguin, s, paintings, through, chaudet, and, now, made, an, agreement, with, gauguin, directly, the, agreement, provided, gauguin, a, regular, monthly, advance, of, 300, francs, against, a, guaranteed, purchase, of, at, least, 25, unseen, paintings, a, year, at, 200, francs, each, and, in, addition, vollard, undertook, to, provide, him, with, his, art, materials, there, were, some, initial, problems, on, both, sides, but, gauguin, was, finally, able, to, realise, his, long, cherished, plan, of, resettling, in, the, marquesas, islands, in, search, of, a, yet, more, primitive, society, he, spent, his, final, months, in, tahiti, living, in, considerable, comfort, as, attested, by, the, liberality, with, which, he, entertained, his, friends, at, that, time, gauguin, was, unable, to, continue, his, work, in, ceramics, in, the, islands, for, the, simple, reason, that, suitable, clay, was, not, available, similarly, without, access, to, a, printing, press, le, sourire, was, hectographed, he, was, obliged, to, turn, to, the, monotype, process, in, his, graphic, work, surviving, examples, of, these, prints, are, rather, rare, and, command, very, high, prices, in, the, saleroom, during, this, time, gauguin, maintained, a, relationship, with, pahura, pau, ura, a, tai, the, daughter, of, neighbours, in, puna, auia, gauguin, began, this, relationship, when, pau, ura, was, 14, 1, 2, years, old, he, fathered, two, children, with, her, of, which, a, daughter, died, in, infancy, the, other, a, boy, she, raised, herself, his, descendants, still, inhabited, tahiti, at, the, time, of, mathews, biography, pahura, refused, to, accompany, gauguin, to, the, marquesas, away, from, her, family, in, puna, auia, earlier, she, had, left, him, when, he, took, work, in, papeete, just, 10, miles, away, when, the, english, writer, willam, somerset, maugham, visited, her, in, 1917, she, could, offer, him, no, useful, memory, of, gauguin, and, chided, him, for, visiting, her, without, bringing, money, from, gauguin, s, family, gauguin, had, nurtured, his, plan, of, settling, in, the, marquesas, ever, since, seeing, a, collection, of, intricately, carved, marquesan, bowls, and, weapons, in, papeete, during, his, first, months, in, tahiti, however, he, found, a, society, that, as, in, tahiti, had, lost, its, cultural, identity, of, all, the, pacific, island, groups, the, marquesas, were, the, most, affected, by, the, import, of, western, diseases, especially, tuberculosis, an, 18th, century, population, of, some, 80, 000, had, declined, to, just, 4, 000, catholic, missionaries, held, sway, and, in, their, effort, to, control, drunkenness, and, promiscuity, obliged, all, native, children, to, attend, missionary, schools, into, their, teens, french, colonial, rule, was, enforced, by, a, gendarmerie, noted, for, its, malevolence, and, stupidity, while, traders, both, western, and, chinese, exploited, the, natives, appallingly, gauguin, settled, in, atuona, on, the, island, of, hiva, oa, arriving, 16, september, 1901, this, was, the, administrative, capital, of, the, island, group, but, considerably, less, developed, than, papeete, although, there, was, an, efficient, and, regular, steamer, service, between, the, two, there, was, a, military, doctor, but, no, hospital, the, doctor, was, relocated, to, papeete, the, following, february, and, thereafter, gauguin, had, to, rely, on, the, island, s, two, health, care, workers, the, vietnamese, exile, nguyen, van, cam, ky, dong, who, had, settled, on, the, island, but, had, no, formal, medical, training, and, the, protestant, pastor, paul, vernier, who, had, studied, medicine, in, addition, to, theology, both, of, these, were, to, become, close, friends, he, bought, a, plot, of, land, in, the, center, of, the, town, from, the, catholic, mission, having, first, ingratiated, himself, with, the, local, bishop, by, attending, mass, regularly, this, bishop, was, monseigneur, joseph, martin, initially, well, disposed, to, gauguin, because, he, was, aware, that, gauguin, had, sided, with, the, catholic, party, in, tahiti, in, his, journalism, gauguin, built, a, two, floor, house, on, his, plot, sturdy, enough, to, survive, a, later, cyclone, which, washed, away, most, other, dwellings, in, the, town, he, was, helped, in, the, task, by, the, two, best, marquesan, carpenters, on, the, island, one, of, them, called, tioka, tattooed, from, head, to, toe, in, the, traditional, marquesan, way, a, tradition, suppressed, by, the, missionaries, tioka, was, a, deacon, in, vernier, s, congregation, and, became, gauguin, s, neighbour, after, the, cyclone, when, gauguin, gifted, him, a, corner, of, his, plot, the, ground, floor, was, open, air, and, used, for, dining, and, living, while, the, top, floor, was, used, for, sleeping, and, as, his, studio, the, door, to, the, top, floor, was, decorated, with, a, polychrome, wood, carved, lintel, and, jambs, that, still, survive, in, museums, the, lintel, named, the, house, as, maison, du, jouir, i, e, house, of, pleasure, while, the, jambs, echoed, his, earlier, 1889, wood, carving, soyez, amoureuses, vous, serez, heureuses, i, e, be, in, love, you, will, be, happy, the, walls, were, decorated, with, amongst, other, things, his, prized, collection, of, forty, five, pornographic, photographs, he, had, purchased, in, port, said, on, his, way, out, from, france, in, the, early, days, at, least, until, gauguin, found, a, vahine, the, house, drew, appreciative, crowds, in, the, evenings, from, the, natives, who, came, to, stare, at, the, pictures, and, party, half, the, night, away, needless, to, say, all, this, did, not, endear, gauguin, to, the, bishop, still, less, when, gauguin, erected, two, sculptures, he, placed, at, the, foot, of, his, steps, lampooning, the, bishop, and, a, servant, reputed, to, be, the, bishop, s, mistress, and, yet, still, less, when, gauguin, later, attacked, the, unpopular, missionary, school, system, the, sculpture, of, the, bishop, p, re, paillard, is, to, be, found, at, the, national, gallery, of, art, washington, while, its, pendant, piece, th, r, se, realized, a, record, 30, 965, 000, for, a, gauguin, sculpture, at, a, christie, s, new, york, 2015, sale, these, were, among, at, least, eight, sculptures, that, adorned, the, house, according, to, a, posthumous, inventory, most, of, which, are, lost, today, together, they, represented, a, very, public, attack, on, the, hypocrisy, of, the, church, in, sexual, matters, state, funding, for, the, missionary, schools, had, ceased, as, a, result, of, the, 1901, associations, bill, promulgated, throughout, the, french, empire, the, schools, continued, with, difficulty, as, private, institutions, but, these, difficulties, were, compounded, when, gauguin, established, that, attendance, at, any, given, school, was, only, compulsory, within, a, catchment, area, of, some, two, and, a, half, miles, radius, this, led, to, numerous, teenage, daughters, being, withdrawn, from, the, schools, gauguin, called, this, process, rescuing, he, took, as, vahine, one, such, girl, vaeoho, also, called, marie, rose, the, 14, year, old, daughter, of, a, native, couple, who, lived, in, an, adjoining, valley, six, miles, distant, this, can, scarcely, have, been, a, pleasant, task, for, her, as, gauguin, s, sores, were, by, then, extremely, noxious, and, required, daily, dressing, nevertheless, she, lived, willingly, with, him, and, the, following, year, gave, birth, to, a, healthy, daughter, whose, descendants, continue, to, live, on, the, island, by, november, he, had, settled, into, his, new, home, with, vaeoho, a, cook, kahui, two, other, servants, nephews, of, tioka, his, dog, pegau, a, play, on, his, initials, pg, and, a, cat, the, house, itself, although, in, the, center, of, the, town, was, set, amongst, trees, and, secluded, from, view, the, partying, ceased, and, he, began, a, period, of, productive, work, sending, twenty, canvases, to, vollard, the, following, april, he, had, thought, he, would, find, new, motifs, in, the, marquesas, writing, to, monfreid, i, think, in, the, marquesas, where, it, is, easy, to, find, models, a, thing, that, is, growing, more, and, more, difficult, in, tahiti, and, with, new, country, to, explore, with, new, and, more, savage, subject, matter, in, brief, that, i, shall, do, beautiful, things, here, my, imagination, has, begun, to, cool, and, then, too, the, public, has, grown, so, used, to, tahiti, the, world, is, so, stupid, that, if, one, shows, it, canvases, containing, new, and, terrible, elements, tahiti, will, become, comprehensible, and, charming, my, brittany, pictures, are, now, rose, water, because, of, tahiti, tahiti, will, become, eau, de, cologne, because, of, the, marquesas, in, fact, his, marquesas, work, for, the, most, part, can, only, be, distinguished, from, his, tahiti, work, by, experts, or, by, their, dates, paintings, such, as, two, women, remaining, uncertain, in, their, location, for, anna, szech, what, distinguishes, them, is, their, repose, and, melancholy, albeit, containing, elements, of, disquiet, thus, in, the, second, of, two, versions, of, cavaliers, sur, la, plage, riders, on, the, beach, gathering, clouds, and, foamy, breakers, suggest, an, impending, storm, while, the, two, distant, figures, on, grey, horses, echo, similar, figures, in, other, paintings, that, are, taken, to, symbolise, death, gauguin, chose, to, paint, landscapes, still, lifes, and, figure, studies, at, this, time, with, an, eye, to, vollard, s, clientele, avoiding, the, primitive, and, lost, paradise, themes, of, his, tahiti, paintings, but, there, is, a, significant, trio, of, pictures, from, this, last, period, that, suggest, deeper, concerns, the, first, two, of, these, are, jeune, fille, l, ventail, young, girl, with, fan, and, le, sorcier, d, hiva, oa, marquesan, man, in, a, red, cape, the, model, for, jeune, fille, was, the, red, headed, tohotaua, the, daughter, of, a, chieftain, on, a, neighbouring, island, the, portrait, appears, to, have, been, taken, from, a, photograph, that, vernier, later, sent, to, vollard, the, model, for, le, sorcier, may, have, been, haapuani, an, accomplished, dancer, as, well, as, a, feared, magician, who, was, a, close, friend, of, gauguin, s, and, according, to, bengt, danielsson, married, to, tohotau, szech, notes, that, the, white, colour, of, tohotau, s, dress, is, a, symbol, of, power, and, death, in, polynesian, culture, the, sitter, doing, duty, for, a, maohi, culture, as, a, whole, threatened, with, extinction, le, sorcier, appears, to, have, been, executed, at, the, same, time, and, depicts, a, long, haired, young, man, wearing, an, exotic, red, cape, the, androgynous, nature, of, the, image, has, attracted, critical, attention, giving, rise, to, speculation, that, gauguin, intended, to, depict, a, m, h, i, e, a, third, gender, person, rather, than, a, taua, or, priest, the, third, picture, of, the, trio, is, the, mysterious, and, beautiful, contes, barbares, primitive, tales, featuring, tohotau, again, at, the, right, the, left, figure, is, jacob, meyer, de, haan, a, painter, friend, of, gauguin, s, from, their, pont, aven, days, who, had, died, a, few, years, previously, while, the, middle, figure, is, again, androgynous, identified, by, some, as, haapuani, the, buddha, like, pose, and, the, lotus, blossoms, suggests, to, elizabeth, childs, that, the, picture, is, a, meditation, on, the, perpetual, cycle, of, life, and, the, possibility, of, rebirth, as, these, paintings, reached, vollard, after, gauguin, s, sudden, death, nothing, is, known, about, gauguin, s, intentions, in, their, execution, in, march, 1902, the, governor, of, french, polynesia, douard, petit, arrived, in, the, marquesas, to, make, an, inspection, he, was, accompanied, by, douard, charlier, as, head, of, the, judicial, system, charlier, was, an, amateur, painter, who, had, been, befriended, by, gauguin, when, he, first, arrived, as, magistrate, at, papeete, in, 1895, however, their, relationship, had, turned, to, enmity, when, charlier, refused, to, prosecute, gauguin, s, then, vahine, pau, ura, for, a, number, of, trivial, offences, allegedly, housebreaking, and, theft, she, had, committed, at, puna, auia, while, gauguin, was, away, working, in, papeete, gauguin, had, gone, so, far, as, to, publish, an, open, letter, attacking, charlier, about, the, affair, in, les, gu, pes, petit, presumably, suitably, forewarned, refused, to, see, gauguin, to, deliver, the, settlers, protests, gauguin, their, spokesman, about, the, invidious, taxation, system, which, saw, most, revenue, from, the, marquesas, spent, in, papeete, gauguin, responded, in, april, by, refusing, to, pay, his, taxes, and, encouraging, the, settlers, traders, and, planters, to, do, likewise, at, around, the, same, time, gauguin, s, health, began, to, deteriorate, again, revisited, by, the, same, familiar, constellation, of, symptoms, involving, pain, in, the, legs, heart, palpitations, and, general, debility, the, pain, in, his, injured, ankle, grew, insupportable, and, in, july, he, was, obliged, to, order, a, trap, from, papeete, so, that, he, could, get, about, town, by, september, the, pain, was, so, extreme, that, he, resorted, to, morphine, injections, however, he, was, sufficiently, concerned, by, the, habit, he, was, developing, to, turn, his, syringe, set, over, to, a, neighbour, relying, instead, on, laudanum, his, sight, was, also, beginning, to, fail, him, as, attested, by, the, spectacles, he, wears, in, his, last, known, self, portrait, this, was, actually, a, portrait, commenced, by, his, friend, ky, dong, that, he, completed, himself, thus, accounting, for, its, uncharacteristic, style, it, shows, a, man, tired, and, aged, yet, not, entirely, defeated, for, a, while, he, considered, returning, to, europe, to, spain, to, get, treatment, monfreid, advised, him, in, returning, you, will, risk, damaging, that, process, of, incubation, which, is, taking, place, in, the, public, s, appreciation, of, you, at, present, you, are, a, unique, and, legendary, artist, sending, to, us, from, the, remote, south, seas, disconcerting, and, inimitable, works, which, are, the, definitive, creations, of, a, great, man, who, in, a, way, has, already, gone, from, this, world, your, enemies, and, like, all, who, upset, the, mediocrities, you, have, many, enemies, are, silent, but, they, dare, not, attack, you, do, not, even, think, of, it, you, are, so, far, away, you, should, not, return, you, are, already, as, unassailable, as, all, the, great, dead, you, already, belong, to, the, history, of, art, in, july, 1902, vaeoho, by, then, seven, months, pregnant, left, gauguin, to, return, home, to, her, neighbouring, valley, of, hekeani, to, have, her, baby, amongst, family, and, friends, she, gave, birth, in, september, but, did, not, return, gauguin, did, not, subsequently, take, another, vahine, it, was, at, this, time, that, his, quarrel, with, bishop, martin, over, missionary, schools, reached, its, height, the, local, gendarme, d, sir, charpillet, at, first, friendly, to, gauguin, wrote, a, report, to, the, administrator, of, the, island, group, who, resided, on, the, neighbouring, island, of, nuku, hiva, criticizing, gauguin, for, encouraging, natives, to, withdraw, their, children, from, school, as, well, as, encouraging, settlers, to, withhold, payment, of, their, taxes, as, luck, would, have, it, the, post, of, administrator, had, recently, been, filled, by, fran, ois, picquenot, an, old, friend, of, gauguin, s, from, tahiti, and, essentially, sympathetic, to, him, picquenot, advised, charpillet, not, to, take, any, action, over, the, schools, issue, since, gauguin, had, the, law, on, his, side, but, authorised, charpillet, to, seize, goods, from, gauguin, in, lieu, of, payment, of, taxes, if, all, else, failed, possibly, prompted, by, loneliness, and, at, times, unable, to, paint, gauguin, took, to, writing, in, 1901, the, manuscript, of, noa, noa, that, gauguin, had, prepared, along, with, woodcuts, during, his, interlude, in, france, was, finally, published, with, morice, s, poems, in, book, form, in, the, la, plume, edition, the, manuscript, itself, is, now, lodged, in, the, louvre, museum, sections, of, it, including, his, account, of, teha, amana, had, previously, been, published, without, woodcuts, in, 1897, in, la, revue, blanche, while, he, himself, had, published, extracts, in, les, gu, pes, while, he, was, editor, the, la, plume, edition, was, planned, to, include, his, woodcuts, but, he, withheld, permission, to, print, them, on, smooth, paper, as, the, publishers, wished, in, truth, he, had, grown, uninterested, in, the, venture, with, morice, and, never, saw, a, copy, declining, an, offer, of, one, hundred, complimentary, copies, nevertheless, its, publication, inspired, him, to, consider, writing, other, books, at, the, beginning, of, the, year, 1902, he, had, revised, an, old, 1896, 97, manuscript, l, esprit, moderne, et, le, catholicisme, the, modern, spirit, and, catholicism, on, the, roman, catholic, church, adding, some, twenty, pages, containing, insights, gleaned, from, his, dealings, with, bishop, martin, he, sent, this, text, to, bishop, martin, who, responded, by, sending, him, an, illustrated, history, of, the, church, gauguin, returned, the, book, with, critical, remarks, he, later, published, in, his, autobiographical, reminisces, he, next, prepared, a, witty, and, well, documented, essay, racontars, de, rapin, tales, of, a, dabbler, on, critics, and, art, criticism, which, he, sent, for, publication, to, andr, fontainas, art, critic, at, the, mercure, de, france, whose, favourable, review, of, where, do, we, come, from, what, are, we, where, are, we, going, had, done, much, to, restore, his, reputation, fontainas, however, replied, that, he, dared, not, publish, it, it, was, not, subsequently, published, until, 1951, on, 27, may, that, year, the, steamer, service, croix, du, sud, was, shipwrecked, off, the, apataki, atoll, and, for, a, period, of, three, months, the, island, was, left, without, mail, or, supplies, when, mail, service, resumed, gauguin, penned, an, angry, attack, on, governor, petit, in, an, open, letter, complaining, amongst, other, things, about, the, way, they, had, been, abandoned, following, the, shipwreck, the, letter, was, published, by, l, indep, ndant, the, successor, newspaper, to, les, gu, pes, that, november, in, papeete, petit, had, in, fact, followed, an, independent, and, pro, native, policy, to, the, disappointment, of, the, roman, catholic, party, and, the, newspaper, was, preparing, an, attack, on, him, gauguin, also, sent, the, letter, to, the, mercure, de, france, which, published, a, redacted, version, of, it, after, his, death, he, followed, this, with, a, private, letter, to, the, head, of, the, gendarmerie, in, papeete, complaining, about, his, own, local, gendarme, charpillet, s, excesses, in, making, prisoners, labor, for, him, danielsson, notes, that, while, these, and, similar, complaints, were, well, founded, the, motivation, for, them, all, was, wounded, vanity, and, simple, animosity, as, it, happened, the, relatively, supportive, charpillet, was, replaced, that, december, by, another, gendarme, jean, paul, claverie, from, tahiti, much, less, well, disposed, to, gauguin, and, who, in, fact, had, fined, him, in, his, earliest, mataiea, days, for, public, indecency, having, caught, him, bathing, naked, in, a, local, stream, following, complaints, from, the, missionaries, there, his, health, further, deteriorated, in, december, to, the, extent, that, he, was, scarcely, able, to, paint, he, began, an, autobiographical, memoir, he, called, avant, et, apr, s, before, and, after, published, in, translation, in, the, us, as, intimate, journals, which, he, completed, over, the, next, two, months, the, title, was, supposed, to, reflect, his, experiences, before, and, after, coming, to, tahiti, and, as, tribute, to, his, own, grandmother, s, unpublished, memoir, past, and, future, his, memoir, proved, to, be, a, fragmented, collection, of, observations, about, life, in, polynesia, his, own, life, and, comments, on, literature, and, paintings, he, included, in, it, attacks, on, subjects, as, diverse, as, the, local, gendarmerie, bishop, martin, his, wife, mette, and, the, danes, in, general, and, concluded, with, a, description, of, his, personal, philosophy, conceiving, life, as, an, existential, struggle, to, reconcile, opposing, binaries, mathews, notes, two, closing, remarks, as, a, distillation, of, his, philosophy, no, one, is, good, no, one, is, evil, everyone, is, both, in, the, same, way, and, in, different, ways, it, is, so, small, a, thing, the, life, of, a, man, and, yet, there, is, time, to, do, great, things, fragments, of, the, common, task, he, sent, the, manuscript, to, fontainas, for, editing, but, the, rights, reverted, to, mette, after, gauguin, s, death, and, it, was, not, published, until, 1918, in, a, facsimile, edition, the, american, translation, appearing, in, 1921, at, the, beginning, of, 1903, gauguin, engaged, in, a, campaign, designed, to, expose, the, incompetence, of, the, island, s, gendarmes, in, particular, jean, paul, claverie, for, taking, the, side, of, the, natives, directly, in, a, case, involving, the, alleged, drunkenness, of, a, group, of, them, claverie, however, escaped, censure, at, the, beginning, of, february, gauguin, wrote, to, the, administrator, fran, ois, picquenot, alleging, corruption, by, one, of, claverie, s, subordinates, picquenot, investigated, the, allegations, but, could, not, substantiate, them, claverie, responded, by, filing, a, charge, against, gauguin, of, libeling, a, gendarme, he, was, subsequently, fined, 500, francs, and, sentenced, to, three, months, imprisonment, by, the, local, magistrate, on, 27, march, 1903, gauguin, immediately, filed, an, appeal, in, papeete, and, set, about, raising, the, funds, to, travel, to, papeete, to, hear, his, appeal, at, this, time, gauguin, was, very, weak, and, in, great, pain, and, resorted, once, again, to, using, morphine, he, died, suddenly, on, the, morning, of, 8, may, 1903, earlier, he, had, sent, for, his, pastor, paul, vernier, complaining, of, fainting, fits, they, had, chatted, together, and, vernier, had, left, believing, him, in, a, stable, condition, however, gauguin, s, neighbour, tioka, found, him, dead, at, 11, o, clock, confirming, the, fact, in, the, traditional, marquesan, way, by, biting, his, scalp, in, an, attempt, to, revive, him, by, his, bedside, was, an, empty, bottle, of, laudanum, which, has, given, rise, to, speculation, that, he, was, the, victim, of, an, overdose, vernier, believed, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, gauguin, was, buried, in, the, catholic, calvary, cemetery, cimeti, re, calvaire, atuona, hiva, oa, at, 2, p, m, the, next, day, in, 1973, a, bronze, cast, of, his, oviri, figure, was, placed, on, his, grave, as, he, had, indicated, was, his, wish, ironically, his, nearest, neighbor, in, the, cemetery, is, bishop, martin, his, grave, surmounted, by, a, large, white, cross, vernier, wrote, an, account, of, gauguin, s, last, days, and, burial, reproduced, in, o, brien, s, edition, of, gauguin, s, letters, to, monfreid, word, of, gauguin, s, death, did, not, reach, france, to, monfreid, until, 23, august, 1903, in, the, absence, of, a, will, his, less, valuable, effects, were, auctioned, in, atuona, while, his, letters, manuscripts, and, paintings, were, auctioned, in, papeete, on, 5, september, 1903, mathews, notes, that, this, speedy, dispersal, of, his, effects, led, to, the, loss, of, much, valuable, information, about, his, later, years, thomson, notes, that, the, auction, inventory, of, his, effects, some, of, which, were, burned, as, pornography, revealed, a, life, that, was, not, as, impoverished, or, primitive, as, he, had, liked, to, maintain, mette, gauguin, in, due, course, received, the, proceeds, of, the, auction, some, 4, 000, francs, one, of, the, paintings, auctioned, in, papeete, was, maternit, ii, a, smaller, version, of, maternit, i, in, the, hermitage, museum, the, original, was, painted, at, the, time, his, then, vahine, pau, ura, in, puna, auia, gave, birth, to, their, son, emile, it, is, not, known, why, he, painted, the, smaller, copy, it, was, sold, for, 150, francs, to, a, french, naval, officer, commandant, cochin, who, said, that, governor, petit, himself, had, bid, up, to, 135, francs, for, the, painting, it, was, sold, at, sotheby, s, for,

still, carrying, gauguin, s, carved, lintel, this, was, eventually, recovered, four, of, the, five, pieces, held, at, the, mus, e, d, orsay, and, the, fifth, at, the, paul, gauguin, museum, in, tahiti, in, 2014, forensic, examination, of, four, teeth, found, in, a, glass, jar, in, a, well, near, gauguin, s, house, threw, into, question, the, conventional, belief, that, gauguin, had, suffered, from, syphilis, dna, examination, established, that, the, teeth, were, almost, certainly, gauguin, s, but, no, traces, were, found, of, the, mercury, that, was, used, to, treat, syphilis, at, the, time, suggesting, either, that, gauguin, did, not, suffer, from, syphilis, or, that, he, was, not, being, treated, for, it, in, 2007, four, rotten, molars, which, may, have, been, gauguin, s, were, found, by, archaeologists, at, the, bottom, of, a, well, that, he, built, on, the, island, of, hiva, oa, on, the, marquese, islands, gauguin, outlived, three, of, his, children, his, favorite, daughter, aline, died, of, pneumonia, his, son, clovis, died, of, a, blood, infection, following, a, hip, operation, and, a, daughter, whose, birth, was, portrayed, in, gauguin, s, painting, of, 1896, te, tamari, no, atua, the, child, of, gauguin, s, young, tahitian, mistress, pau, ura, died, only, a, few, days, after, her, birth, on, christmas, day, 1896, his, son, mile, gauguin, worked, as, a, construction, engineer, in, the, u, s, and, is, buried, in, lemon, bay, historical, cemetery, in, florida, another, son, jean, ren, became, a, well, known, sculptor, and, a, staunch, socialist, he, died, on, 21, april, 1961, in, copenhagen, pola, paul, rollon, became, an, artist, and, art, critic, and, wrote, a, memoir, my, father, paul, gauguin, 1937, gauguin, had, several, other, children, by, his, mistresses, germaine, born, 1891, with, juliette, huais, 1866, 1955, mile, marae, a, tai, born, 1899, with, pau, ura, and, a, daughter, born, 1902, with, vaeoho, marie, rose, there, is, some, speculation, that, the, belgian, artist, germaine, chardon, was, gauguin, s, daughter, emile, marae, a, tai, illiterate, and, raised, in, tahiti, by, pau, ura, was, brought, to, chicago, in, 1963, by, the, french, journalist, josette, giraud, and, was, an, artist, in, his, own, right, his, descendants, still, living, in, tahiti, as, of, 2001, primitivism, was, an, art, movement, of, late, 19th, century, painting, and, sculpture, characterized, by, exaggerated, body, proportions, animal, totems, geometric, designs, and, stark, contrasts, the, first, artist, to, systematically, use, these, effects, and, achieve, broad, public, success, was, paul, gauguin, the, european, cultural, elite, discovering, the, art, of, africa, micronesia, and, native, americans, for, the, first, time, were, fascinated, intrigued, and, educated, by, the, newness, wildness, and, the, stark, power, embodied, in, the, art, of, those, faraway, places, like, pablo, picasso, in, the, early, days, of, the, 20th, century, gauguin, was, inspired, and, motivated, by, the, raw, power, and, simplicity, of, the, so, called, primitive, art, of, those, foreign, cultures, gauguin, is, also, considered, a, post, impressionist, painter, his, bold, colourful, and, design, oriented, paintings, significantly, influenced, modern, art, artists, and, movements, in, the, early, 20th, century, inspired, by, him, include, vincent, van, gogh, henri, matisse, pablo, picasso, georges, braque, andr, derain, fauvism, cubism, and, orphism, among, others, later, he, influenced, arthur, frank, mathews, and, the, american, arts, and, crafts, movement, john, rewald, recognized, as, a, foremost, authority, on, late, 19th, century, art, wrote, a, series, of, books, about, the, post, impressionist, period, including, post, impressionism, from, van, gogh, to, gauguin, 1956, and, an, essay, paul, gauguin, letters, to, ambroise, vollard, and, andr, fontainas, included, in, rewald, s, studies, in, post, impressionism, 1986, discusses, gauguin, s, years, in, tahiti, and, the, struggles, of, his, survival, as, seen, through, correspondence, with, the, art, dealer, vollard, and, others, gauguin, s, posthumous, retrospective, exhibitions, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, in, 1903, and, an, even, larger, one, in, 1906, had, a, stunning, and, powerful, influence, on, the, french, avant, garde, and, in, particular, pablo, picasso, s, paintings, in, the, autumn, of, 1906, picasso, made, paintings, of, oversized, nude, women, and, monumental, sculptural, figures, that, recalled, the, work, of, paul, gauguin, and, showed, his, interest, in, primitive, art, picasso, s, paintings, of, massive, figures, from, 1906, were, directly, influenced, by, gauguin, s, sculpture, painting, and, his, writing, as, well, the, power, evoked, by, gauguin, s, work, led, directly, to, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, in, 1907, according, to, gauguin, biographer, david, sweetman, picasso, as, early, as, 1902, became, a, fan, of, gauguin, s, work, when, he, met, and, befriended, the, expatriate, spanish, sculptor, and, ceramist, paco, durrio, in, paris, durrio, had, several, of, gauguin, s, works, on, hand, because, he, was, a, friend, of, gauguin, s, and, an, unpaid, agent, of, his, work, durrio, tried, to, help, his, poverty, stricken, friend, in, tahiti, by, promoting, his, oeuvre, in, paris, after, they, met, durrio, introduced, picasso, to, gauguin, s, stoneware, helped, picasso, make, some, ceramic, pieces, and, gave, picasso, a, first, la, plume, edition, of, noa, noa, the, tahiti, journal, of, paul, gauguin, in, addition, to, seeing, gauguin, s, work, at, durrio, s, picasso, also, saw, the, work, at, ambroise, vollard, s, gallery, where, both, he, and, gauguin, were, represented, concerning, gauguin, s, impact, on, picasso, john, richardson, wrote, the, 1906, exhibition, of, gauguin, s, work, left, picasso, more, than, ever, in, this, artist, s, thrall, gauguin, demonstrated, the, most, disparate, types, of, art, not, to, speak, of, elements, from, metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the, bible, classical, myths, and, much, else, besides, could, be, combined, into, a, synthesis, that, was, of, its, time, yet, timeless, an, artist, could, also, confound, conventional, notions, of, beauty, he, demonstrated, by, harnessing, his, demons, to, the, dark, gods, not, necessarily, tahitian, ones, and, tapping, a, new, source, of, divine, energy, if, in, later, years, picasso, played, down, his, debt, to, gauguin, there, is, no, doubt, that, between, 1905, and, 1907, he, felt, a, very, close, kinship, with, this, other, paul, who, prided, himself, on, spanish, genes, inherited, from, his, peruvian, grandmother, had, not, picasso, signed, himself, paul, in, gauguin, s, honor, both, david, sweetman, and, john, richardson, point, to, the, gauguin, sculpture, called, oviri, literally, meaning, savage, the, gruesome, phallic, figure, of, the, tahitian, goddess, of, life, and, death, that, was, intended, for, gauguin, s, grave, exhibited, in, the, 1906, retrospective, exhibition, that, even, more, directly, led, to, les, demoiselles, sweetman, writes, gauguin, s, statue, oviri, which, was, prominently, displayed, in, 1906, was, to, stimulate, picasso, s, interest, in, both, sculpture, and, ceramics, while, the, woodcuts, would, reinforce, his, interest, in, print, making, though, it, was, the, element, of, the, primitive, in, all, of, them, which, most, conditioned, the, direction, that, picasso, s, art, would, take, this, interest, would, culminate, in, the, seminal, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, according, to, richardson, picasso, s, interest, in, stoneware, was, further, stimulated, by, the, examples, he, saw, at, the, 1906, gauguin, retrospective, at, the, salon, d, automne, the, most, disturbing, of, those, ceramics, one, that, picasso, might, have, already, seen, at, vollard, s, was, the, gruesome, oviri, until, 1987, when, the, mus, e, d, orsay, acquired, this, little, known, work, exhibited, only, once, since, 1906, it, had, never, been, recognized, as, the, masterpiece, it, is, let, alone, recognized, for, its, relevance, to, the, works, leading, up, to, the, demoiselles, although, just, under, 30, inches, high, oviri, has, an, awesome, presence, as, befits, a, monument, intended, for, gauguin, s, grave, picasso, was, very, struck, by, oviri, 50, years, later, he, was, delighted, when, cooper, and, i, told, him, that, we, had, come, upon, this, sculpture, in, a, collection, that, also, included, the, original, plaster, of, his, cubist, head, has, it, been, a, revelation, like, iberian, sculpture, picasso, s, shrug, was, grudgingly, affirmative, he, was, always, loath, to, admit, gauguin, s, role, in, setting, him, on, the, road, to, primitivism, gauguin, s, initial, artistic, guidance, was, from, pissarro, but, the, relationship, left, more, of, a, mark, personally, than, stylistically, gauguin, s, masters, were, giotto, raphael, ingres, eug, ne, delacroix, manet, degas, and, c, zanne, his, own, beliefs, and, in, some, cases, the, psychology, behind, his, work, were, also, influenced, by, philosopher, arthur, schopenhauer, and, poet, st, phane, mallarm, gauguin, like, some, of, his, contemporaries, such, as, degas, and, toulouse, lautrec, employed, a, technique, for, painting, on, canvas, known, as, peinture, l, essence, for, this, the, oil, binder, is, drained, from, the, paint, and, the, remaining, sludge, of, pigment, is, mixed, with, turpentine, he, may, have, used, a, similar, technique, in, preparing, his, monotypes, using, paper, instead, of, metal, as, it, would, absorb, oil, giving, the, final, images, a, matte, appearance, he, desired, he, also, proofed, some, of, his, existing, drawings, with, the, aid, of, glass, copying, an, underneath, image, onto, the, glass, surface, with, watercolour, or, gouache, for, printing, gauguin, s, woodcuts, were, no, less, innovative, even, to, the, avant, garde, artists, responsible, for, the, woodcut, revival, happening, at, that, time, instead, of, incising, his, blocks, with, the, intent, of, making, a, detailed, illustration, gauguin, initially, chiseled, his, blocks, in, a, manner, similar, to, wood, sculpture, followed, by, finer, tools, to, create, detail, and, tonality, within, his, bold, contours, many, of, his, tools, and, techniques, were, considered, experimental, this, methodology, and, use, of, space, ran, parallel, to, his, painting, of, flat, decorative, reliefs, starting, in, martinique, gauguin, began, using, analogous, colours, in, close, proximity, to, achieve, a, muted, effect, shortly, after, this, he, also, made, his, breakthroughs, in, non, representational, colour, creating, canvases, that, had, an, independent, existence, and, vitality, all, their, own, this, gap, between, surface, reality, and, himself, displeased, pissarro, and, quickly, led, to, the, end, of, their, relationship, his, human, figures, at, this, time, are, also, a, reminder, of, his, love, affair, with, japanese, prints, particularly, gravitating, to, the, naivety, of, their, figures, and, compositional, austerity, as, an, influence, on, his, primitive, manifesto, for, that, very, reason, gauguin, was, also, inspired, by, folk, art, he, sought, out, a, bare, emotional, purity, of, his, subjects, conveyed, in, a, straightforward, way, emphasizing, major, forms, and, upright, lines, to, clearly, define, shape, and, contour, gauguin, also, used, elaborate, formal, decoration, and, colouring, in, patterns, of, abstraction, attempting, to, harmonize, man, and, nature, his, depictions, of, the, natives, in, their, natural, environment, are, frequently, evident, of, serenity, and, a, self, contained, sustainability, this, complemented, one, of, gauguin, s, favorite, themes, which, was, the, intrusion, of, the, supernatural, into, day, to, day, life, in, one, instance, going, so, far, as, to, recall, ancient, egyptian, tomb, reliefs, with, her, name, is, vairaumati, and, ta, matete, in, an, interview, with, l, cho, de, paris, published, on, 15, march, 1895, gauguin, explains, that, his, developing, tactical, approach, is, reaching, for, synesthesia, he, states, in, an, 1888, letter, to, schuffenecker, gauguin, explains, the, enormous, step, he, had, taken, away, from, impressionism, and, that, he, was, now, intent, on, capturing, the, soul, of, nature, the, ancient, truths, and, character, of, its, scenery, and, inhabitants, gauguin, wrote, gauguin, began, making, prints, in, 1889, highlighted, by, a, series, of, zincographs, commissioned, by, theo, van, gogh, known, as, the, volpini, suite, which, also, appeared, in, the, cafe, des, arts, show, of, 1889, gauguin, was, not, hindered, by, his, printing, inexperience, and, made, a, number, of, provocative, and, unorthodox, choices, such, as, a, zinc, plate, instead, of, limestone, lithography, wide, margins, and, large, sheets, of, yellow, poster, paper, the, result, was, vivid, to, the, point, of, garish, but, foreshadows, his, more, elaborate, experiments, with, colour, printing, and, intent, to, elevate, monochromatic, images, his, first, masterpieces, of, printing, were, from, the, noa, noa, suite, of, 1893, 94, where, he, was, one, of, a, number, of, artists, reinventing, the, technique, of, the, woodcut, bringing, it, into, the, modern, era, he, started, the, series, shortly, after, returning, from, tahiti, eager, to, reclaim, a, leadership, position, within, the, avant, garde, and, share, pictures, based, on, his, french, polynesia, excursion, these, woodcuts, were, shown, at, his, unsuccessful, 1893, show, at, paul, durand, ruel, s, and, most, were, directly, related, to, paintings, of, his, in, which, he, had, revised, the, original, composition, they, were, shown, again, at, a, small, show, in, his, studio, in, 1894, where, he, garnered, rare, critical, praise, for, his, exceptional, painterly, and, sculptural, effects, gauguin, s, emerging, preference, for, the, woodcut, was, not, only, a, natural, extension, of, his, wood, reliefs, and, sculpture, but, may, have, also, been, provoked, by, its, historical, significance, to, medieval, artisans, and, the, japanese, gauguin, started, making, watercolour, monotypes, in, 1894, likely, overlapping, his, noa, noa, woodcuts, perhaps, even, serving, as, a, source, of, inspiration, for, them, his, techniques, remained, innovative, and, it, was, an, apt, technique, for, him, as, it, did, not, require, elaborate, equipment, such, as, a, printing, press, despite, often, being, a, source, of, practice, for, related, paintings, sculptures, or, woodcuts, his, monotype, innovation, offers, a, distinctly, ethereal, aesthetic, ghostly, afterimages, that, may, express, his, desire, to, convey, the, immemorial, truths, of, nature, his, next, major, woodcut, and, monotype, project, was, not, until, 1898, 99, known, as, the, vollard, suite, he, completed, this, enterprising, series, of, 475, prints, from, some, twenty, different, compositions, and, sent, them, to, the, dealer, ambroise, vollard, despite, not, compromising, to, his, request, for, salable, conformed, work, vollard, was, unsatisfied, and, made, no, effort, to, sell, them, gauguin, s, series, is, starkly, unified, with, black, and, white, aesthetic, and, may, have, intended, the, prints, to, be, similar, to, a, set, of, myriorama, cards, in, which, they, may, be, laid, out, in, any, order, to, create, multiple, panoramic, landscapes, this, activity, of, arranging, and, rearranging, was, similar, to, his, own, process, of, repurposing, his, images, and, motifs, as, well, as, a, symbolism, tendency, he, printed, the, work, on, tissue, thin, japanese, paper, and, the, multiple, proofs, of, gray, and, black, could, be, arranged, on, top, of, one, another, each, transparency, of, colour, showing, through, to, produce, a, rich, chiaroscuro, effect, in, 1899, he, started, his, radical, experiment, oil, transfer, drawings, much, like, his, watercolour, monotype, technique, it, was, a, hybrid, of, drawing, and, printmaking, the, transfers, were, the, grand, culmination, of, his, quest, for, an, aesthetic, of, primordial, suggestion, which, seems, to, be, relayed, in, his, results, that, echo, ancient, rubbings, worn, frescos, and, cave, paintings, gauguin, s, technical, progress, from, monotyping, to, the, oil, transfers, is, quite, noticeable, advancing, from, small, sketches, to, ambitiously, large, highly, finished, sheets, with, these, transfers, he, created, depth, and, texture, by, printing, multiple, layers, onto, the, same, sheet, beginning, with, graphite, pencil, and, black, ink, for, delineation, before, moving, to, blue, crayon, to, reinforce, line, and, add, shading, he, would, often, complete, the, image, with, a, wash, of, oiled, down, olive, or, brown, ink, the, practice, consumed, gauguin, until, his, death, fueling, his, imagination, and, conception, of, new, subjects, and, themes, for, his, paintings, this, collection, was, also, sent, to, vollard, who, remained, unimpressed, gauguin, prized, oil, transfers, for, the, way, they, transformed, the, quality, of, drawn, line, his, process, nearly, alchemical, in, nature, had, elements, of, chance, by, which, unexpected, marks, and, textures, regularly, arose, something, that, fascinated, him, in, metamorphosing, a, drawing, into, a, print, gauguin, made, a, calculated, decision, of, relinquishing, legibility, in, order, to, gain, mystery, and, abstraction, he, worked, in, wood, throughout, his, career, particularly, during, his, most, prolific, periods, and, is, known, for, having, achieved, radical, carving, results, before, doing, so, with, painting, even, in, his, earliest, shows, gauguin, often, included, wood, sculpture, in, his, display, from, which, he, built, his, reputation, as, a, connoisseur, of, the, so, called, primitive, a, number, of, his, early, carvings, appear, to, be, influenced, by, gothic, and, egyptian, art, in, correspondence, he, also, asserts, a, passion, for, cambodian, art, and, the, masterful, colouring, of, persian, carpet, and, oriental, rug, the, vogue, for, gauguin, s, work, started, soon, after, his, death, many, of, his, later, paintings, were, acquired, by, the, russian, collector, sergei, shchukin, a, substantial, part, of, his, collection, is, displayed, in, the, pushkin, museum, and, the, hermitage, gauguin, paintings, are, rarely, offered, for, sale, their, prices, reaching, tens, of, millions, of, us, dollars, in, the, saleroom, when, they, are, offered, his, 1892, nafea, faa, ipoipo, when, will, you,
