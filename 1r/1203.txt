as, very, improbable, in, its, details, the, professor, notes, that, zara, yaqob, wrote, in, his, mashafa, berhan, that, he, was, brought, down, from, the, royal, prison, of, mount, gishan, only, on,

the, oldest, qualified, candidate, david, buxton, points, out, the, effect, that, his, forced, seclusion, had, on, his, personality, deprived, of, all, contact, with, ordinary, people, or, ordinary, life, thrust, into, a, position, of, leadership, with, no, experience, of, the, affairs, of, state, he, was, faced, by, a, kingdom, seething, with, plots, and, rebellions, a, church, riven, with, heresies, and, outside, enemies, constantly, threatening, invasion, buxton, continues, although, he, became, emperor, in, 1434, zara, yaqob, was, not, crowned, until, 1436, at, axum, where, he, resided, for, three, years, during, his, first, years, on, the, throne, zara, yaqob, launched, a, strong, campaign, against, survivals, of, pagan, worship, and, un, christian, practices, within, the, church, according, to, a, manuscript, written, in, 1784, he, appointed, spies, to, search, and, smell, out, heretics, who, admitted, to, worshipping, pagan, gods, such, as, dasek, dail, guidale,

disobeyed, the, edict, had, his, property, looted, and, was, either, beaten, or, executed, the, ethiopian, church, had, been, divided, over, the, issue, of, biblical, sabbath, observance, for, roughly, a, century, one, group, which, was, loyal, to, the, coptic, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, believed, that, the, day, of, rest, should, be, observed, only, on, sunday, or, great, sabbath, another, group, the, followers, of, ewostatewos, believed, with, its, founder, that, both, the, original, seventh, day, sabbath, saturday, or, lesser, sabbath, and, sunday, should, be, observed, zara, yaqob, was, successful, in, persuading, two, recently, arrived, egyptian, abuna, mikael, and, gabriel, into, accepting, a, compromise, aimed, at, restoring, harmony, with, the, house, of, ewostatewos, as, the, followers, of, ewostatewos, were, known, at, the, same, time, he, made, efforts, to, pacify, the, house, of, ewostatewos, while, the, ewostathians, were, won, over, to, the, compromise, by, 1442, the, two, abuns, agreed, to, the, compromise, only, at, the, council, of, debre, mitmaq, in, tegulet, 1450, garad, mahiko, the, son, of, the, hadiya, ruler, garad, mehmad, refused, to, submit, to, abyssinia, however, with, the, help, of, one, of, mahiko, s, followers, the, garad, was, deposed, in, favor, of, his, uncle, bamo, garad, mahiko, then, sought, sanctuary, at, the, court, of, the, adal, sultanate, he, was, later, slain, by, the, military, contingent, adal, mabrak, who, had, been, in, pursuit, the, chronicles, record, that, the, adal, mabrak, sent, mahiko, s, head, and, limbs,

river, garad, mehamed, although, she, failed, to, bear, him, any, children, eleni, grew, into, a, powerful, political, person, when, a, conspiracy, involving, one, of, his, bitwodeds, came, to, light, zara, yaqob, reacted, by, appointing, his, two, daughters, medhan, zamada, and, berhan, zamada, to, these, two, offices, according, to, the, chronicle, of, his, reign, the, emperor, also, appointed, his, daughters, and, nieces, as, governors, over, eight, of, his, provinces, these, appointments, were, not, successful, after, hearing, about, the, demolition, of, the, egyptian, debre, mitmaq, monastery, he, ordered, a, period, of, national, mourning, and, built, a, church, of, the, same, name, in, tegulet, he, then, sent, a, letter, of, strong, protest, to, the, egyptian, sultan, sayf, ad, din, jaqmaq, he, reminded, jaqmaq, that, he, had, muslim, subjects, whom, he, treated, fairly, and, warned, that, he, had, the, power, to, divert, the, nile, but, refrained, from, doing, so, for, the, human, suffering, it, would, cause, jaqmaq, responded, with, gifts, to, appease, zara, yaqob, s, anger, but, refused, to, rebuild, the, coptic, churches, he, had, destroyed, the, sultan, would, then, encourage, the, adal, sultanate, to, invade, the, province, of, dawaro, to, distract, the, emperor, but, zara, yaqob, managed, to, defeated, badlay, ad, din, the, sultan, of, adal, at, the, battle,

a, group, of, warriors, from, shewa, in, hamassien, as, military, settlers, these, settlers, were, believed, to, have, the, terrified, the, local, population, and, it, is, said, that, the, earth, trembled, at, their, arrival, and, the, inhabitants, fled, the, country, in, fear, it, is, during, this, time, that, the, title, of, the, coastal, regions, ruler, bahr, negash, first, appears, in, records, and, according, to, richard, pankhurst, the, office, was, likely, introduced, by, zara, yaqob, after, observing, a, bright, light, in, the, sky, which, most, historians, have, identified, as, halley, s, comet, visible, in, ethiopia, in, 1456, and, believing, it, to, be, a, sign, from, god, indicating, his, approval, of, the, execution, by, stoning, of, a, group, of, heretics, 38, days, earlier, zara, yaqob, established, debre, berhan, as, his, capital, for, the, duration, of, his, reign, he, ordered, a, church, built, on, the, site, and, later, constructed, an, extensive, palace,

hawariat, abbot, of, dabra, libanos, criticized, yaqob, s, beatings, and, murder, of, men, the, emperor, had, the, abbot, himself, beaten, and, imprisoned, where, he, died, after, a, few, months, zara, yaqob, was, convinced, of, a, plot, against, him, in, 1453, which, led, to, more, brutal, actions, he, increasingly, became, convinced, that, his, wife, and, children, were, plotting, against, him, and, had, several, of, them, beaten, seyon, morgasa, the, mother, of, the, future, emperor, baeda, maryam, i, died, from, this, mistreatment, in, 1462, which, led, to, a, complete, break, between, son, and, father, eventually, relations, between, the, two, were, repaired, and, zara, yaqob, publicly, designated, baeda, maryam, as, his, successor, near, the, end, of, his, reign, in, 1464, 1465, massawa, and, the, dahlak, archipelago, were, pillaged, by, emperor, zara, yaqob, and, the, sultanate, of, dahlak, was, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, the, ethiopian, empire, according, to,
