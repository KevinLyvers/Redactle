a, kidney, and, liver, rupture, a, dislocated, shoulder, and, a, broken, skull, the, accidents, may, have, precipitated, the, physical, deterioration, that, was, to, follow, after, the, plane,

the, prize, money, mellow, says, hemingway, had, coveted, the, nobel, prize, but, when, he, won, it, months, after, his, plane, accidents, and, their, worldwide, press, coverage, there, must, have, been, a, lingering, suspicion, in, hemingway, s, mind, that, his, obituary, notices, had, played, a, part, in, the, academy, s, decision, he, was, still, recuperating, and, decided, against, traveling, to, stockholm, instead, he, sent, a, speech, to, be, read, in, which, he, defined, the, writer, s, life, writing, at, its, best, is, a, lonely, life, organizations, for, writers, palliate, the, writer, s, loneliness, but, i, doubt, if, they, improve, his, writing, he, grows, in, public, stature, as, he, sheds, his, loneliness, and, often, his, work, deteriorates, for, he, does, his, work, alone, and, if, he, is, a, good, enough, writer, he, must, face, eternity, or, the, lack, of, it, each, day, since, his, return, from, africa, hemingway, had, been, slowly, writing, his, african, journal, late, in, the, year, and, early, into, 1956, he, was, bedridden, with, a, variety, of, illnesses, he, was, ordered, to, stop, drinking, so, as, to, mitigate, liver, damage, advice,

reminded, of, trunks, he, had, stored, in, the, ritz, hotel, in, 1928, and, never, retrieved, upon, re, claiming, and, opening, the, trunks, hemingway, discovered, they, were, filled, with, notebooks, and, writing, from, his, paris, years, excited, about, the, discovery, when, he, returned, to, cuba, in, early, 1957, he, began, to, shape, the, recovered, work, into, his, memoir, a, moveable, feast,

chapters, to, the, garden, of, eden, and, worked, on, islands, in, the, stream, the, last, three, were, stored, in, a, safe, deposit, box, in, havana, as, he, focused, on, the, finishing, touches, for, a, moveable, feast, reynolds, claims, it, was, during, this, period, that, hemingway, slid, into, depression, from, which, he, was, unable, to, recover, finca, vig, a, became, crowded, with, guests, and, tourists, as, hemingway, considered, a, permanent, move, to, idaho, in, 1959, he, bought, a, home, overlooking, the, big, wood, river, outside, ketchum, and, left, cuba, although, he, apparently, remained, on, easy, terms, with, the, castro, government, telling, the, new, york, times, he, was, delighted, with, castro, s, overthrow, of, batista, he, was, in, cuba, in, november, 1959, between, returning, from, pamplona, and, traveling, west, to, idaho, and, the, following, year, for, his, 61st, birthday, however, that, year, he, and, mary, decided, to, leave, after, hearing,

about, 5, 000, books, hemingway, continued, to, rework, the, material, that, was, published, as, a, moveable, feast, through, the, 1950s, in, mid, 1959, he, visited, spain, to, research, a, series, of, bullfighting, articles, commissioned, by, life, magazine, life, wanted, only, 10, 000, words, but, the, manuscript, grew, out, of, control, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, he, could, not, organize, his, writing, so, he, asked, a, e, hotchner, to, travel, to, cuba, to, help, him, hotchner, helped, trim, the, life, piece, down, to, 40, 000, words, and, scribner, s, agreed, to, a, full, length, book, version, the, dangerous, summer, of, almost, 130, 000, words, hotchner, found, hemingway, to, be, unusually, hesitant, disorganized, and, confused, and, suffering, badly, from, failing, eyesight, he, left, cuba, for, the, last, time, on, july, 25, 1960, mary, went, with, him, to, new, york, where, he, set, up, a, small, office, and, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, work, soon, after, he, left, new, york, traveling, without, mary, to, spain, to, be, photographed, for, the, front, cover, of, life, magazine, a, few, days, later, the, news, reported, that, he, was, seriously, ill, and, on, the, verge, of, dying, which, panicked, mary, until, she, received, a, cable, from, him, telling, her, reports, false, enroute, madrid, love, papa, he, was, in, fact, seriously, ill, and, believed, himself, to, be, on, the, verge, of, a, breakdown, feeling, lonely, he, took, to, his, bed, for, days, retreating, into, silence, despite, having, the, first, installments, of, the, dangerous, summer, published, in, life, that, september, to, good, reviews, in, october, he, went, back, to, new, york, where, he, refused, to, leave, mary, s, apartment, presuming, that, he, was, being, watched, she, quickly, took, him, to, idaho, where, they, were, met, at, the, train, station, in, ketchum, by, local, physician, george, saviers, he, was, concerned, about, finances, missed, cuba, his, books, and, his, life, there, and, fretted, that, he, would, never, return, to, retrieve, the, manuscripts, that, he, had, left, in, a, bank, vault, he, believed, the, manuscripts, that, would, be, published, as, islands, in, the, stream, and, true, at, first, light, were, lost, he, became, paranoid, believing, that, the, fbi, was, actively, monitoring, his, movements, in, ketchum, mary, was, unable, to, care, for, her, husband, and, it, was, anathema, for, a, man, of, hemingway, s, generation, to, accept, he, suffered, from, mental, illness, at, the, end, of, november, saviers, flew, him, to, the, mayo, clinic, in, minnesota, on, the, pretext, that, he, was, to, be, treated, for, hypertension, he, was, checked, in, under, saviers, s, name, to, maintain, anonymity, meyers, writes, that, an, aura, of, secrecy, surrounds, hemingway, s, treatment, at, the, mayo, but, confirms, that, he, was, treated, with, electroconvulsive, therapy, ect, as, many, as, 15, times, in, december, 1960, reynolds, gained, access, to, hemingway, s, records, at, the, mayo, which, document, 10, ect, sessions, the, doctors, in, rochester, told, hemingway, the, depressive, state, for, which, he, was, being, treated, may, have, been, caused, by, his, long, term, use, of, reserpine, and, ritalin, of, the, ect, therapy, hemingway, told, hotchner, what, is, the, sense, of, ruining, my, head, and, erasing, my, memory, which, is, my, capital, and, putting, me, out, of, business, it, was, a, brilliant, cure, but, we, lost, the, patient, in, late, january, 1961, he, was, sent, home, as, meyers, writes, in, ruins, asked, to, provide, a, tribute, to, president, john, f, kennedy, in, february, he, could, only, produce, a, few, sentences, after, a, week, s, effort, a, few, months, later, on, april, 21, mary, found, hemingway, with, a, shotgun, in, the, kitchen, she, called, saviers, who, admitted, hemingway, to, the, sun, valley, hospital, under, sedation, once, the, weather, cleared, saviers, flew, again, to, rochester, with, his, patient, hemingway, underwent, three, electroshock, treatments, during, that, visit, he, was, released, at, the, end, of, june, and, was, home, in, ketchum, on, june, 30, two, days, later, hemingway, quite, deliberately, shot, himself, with, his, favorite, shotgun, in, the, early, morning, hours, of, july, 2, 1961, meyers, writes, that, he, unlocked, the, basement, storeroom, where, his, guns, were, kept, went, upstairs, to, the, front, entrance, foyer, pushed, two, shells, into, the, twelve, gauge, boss, shotgun, put, the, end, of, the, barrel, into, his, mouth, pulled, the, trigger, and, blew, out, his, brains, in, 2010, however, it, was, argued, that, hemingway, never, owned, a, boss, and, that, the, suicide, gun, was, actually, made, by, w, c, scott, son, his, favorite, one, that, was, used, at, shooting, competitions, in, cuba, duck, hunts, in, italy, or, at, a, safari, in, east, africa, when, the, authorities, arrived, mary, was, sedated, and, taken, to, the, hospital, returning, to, the, house, the, next, day, she, cleaned, the, house, and, saw, to, the, funeral, and, travel, arrangements, bernice, kert, writes, that, it, did, not, seem, to, her, a, conscious, lie, when, she, told, the, press, that, his, death, had, been, accidental, in, a, press, interview, five, years, later, mary, confirmed, that, he, had, shot, himself, family, and, friends, flew, to, ketchum, for, the, funeral, officiated, by, the, local, catholic, priest, who, believed, that, the, death, had, been, accidental, an, altar, boy, fainted, at, the, head, of, the, casket, during, the, funeral, and, hemingway, s, brother, leicester, wrote, it, seemed, to, me, ernest, would, have, approved, of, it, all, hemingway, s, behavior, during, his, final, years, had, been, similar, to, that, of, his, father, before, he, killed, himself, his, father, may, have, had, hereditary, hemochromatosis, whereby, the, excessive, accumulation, of, iron, in, tissues, culminates, in, mental, and, physical, deterioration, medical, records, made, available, in, 1991, confirmed, that, hemingway, had, been, diagnosed, with, hemochromatosis, in, early, 1961, his, sister, ursula, and, his, brother, leicester, also, killed, themselves, hemingway, s, health, was, further, complicated, by, heavy, drinking, throughout, most, of, his, life, which,

forensic, examination, of, hemingway, s, mental, illness, in, her, review, of, farah, s, book, beegel, writes, that, farah, postulates, hemingway, suffered, from, the, combination, of, depression, the, side, effects, of, nine, serious, concussions, then, she, writes, add, alcohol, and, stir, farah, writes, that, hemingway, s, concussions, resulted, in, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, which, eventually, led, to, a, form, of, dementia, most, likely, dementia, with, lewy, bodies, he, bases, his, hypothesis, on, hemingway, s, symptoms, consistent, with, dlb, such, as, the, various, comorbidities, and, most, particularly, the, delusions, which, surfaced, as, early, as, the, late, 1940s, and, were, almost, overwhelming, during, the, final, ketchum, years, beegel, writes, that, farah, s, study, is, convincing, and, should, put, an, end, to, future, speculation, following, the, tradition, established, by, mark, twain, stephen, crane, theodore, dreiser, and, sinclair, lewis, hemingway, was, a, journalist, before, becoming, a, novelist, the, new, york, times, wrote, in, 1926, of, hemingway, s, first, novel, no, amount, of, analysis, can, convey, the, quality, of, the, sun, also, rises, it, is, a, truly, gripping, story, told, in, a, lean, hard, athletic, narrative, prose, that, puts, more, literary, english, to, shame, the, sun, also, rises, is, written, in, the, spare, tight, prose, that, made, hemingway, famous, and, according, to, james, nagel, changed, the, nature, of, american, writing, in, 1954, when, hemingway, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, it, was, for, his, mastery, of, the, art, of, narrative, most, recently, demonstrated, in, the, old, man, and, the, sea, and, for, the, influence, that, he, has, exerted, on, contemporary, style, henry, louis, gates, believes, hemingway, s, style, was, fundamentally, shaped, in, reaction, to, experience, of, world, war, after, world, war, i, he, and, other, modernists, lost, faith, in, the, central, institutions, of, western, civilization, by, reacting, against, the, elaborate, style, of, 19th, century, writers, and, by, creating, a, style, in, which, meaning, is, established, through, dialogue, through, action, and, silences, a, fiction, in, which, nothing, crucial, or, at, least, very, little, is, stated, explicitly, if, a, writer, of, prose, knows, enough, of, what, he, is, writing, about, he, may, omit, things, that, he, knows, and, the, reader, if, the, writer, is, writing, truly, enough, will, have, a, feeling, of, those, things, as, strongly, as, though, the, writer, had, stated, them, the, dignity, of, movement, of, an, ice, berg, is, due, to, only, one, eighth, of, it, being, above, water, a, writer, who, omits, things, because, he, does, not, know, them, only, makes, hollow, places, in, his, writing, ernest, hemingway, in, death, in, the, afternoon, because, he, began, as, a, writer, of, short, stories, baker, believes, hemingway, learned, to, get, the, most, from, the, least, how, to, prune, language, how, to, multiply, intensities, and, how, to, tell, nothing, but, the, truth, in, a, way, that, allowed, for, telling, more, than, the, truth, hemingway, called, his, style, the, iceberg, theory, the, facts, float, above, water, the, supporting, structure, and, symbolism, operate, out, of, sight, the, concept, of, the, iceberg, theory, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, theory, of, omission, hemingway, believed, the, writer, could, describe, one, thing, such, as, nick, adams, fishing, in, big, two, hearted, river, though, an, entirely, different, thing, occurs, below, the, surface, nick, adams, concentrating, on, fishing, to, the, extent, that, he, does, not, have, to, think, about, anything, else, paul, smith, writes, that, hemingway, s, first, stories, collected, as, in, our, time, showed, he, was, still, experimenting, with, his, writing, style, and, when, he, wrote, about, spain, or, other, countries, he, incorporated, foreign, words, into, the, text, which, sometimes, appears, directly, in, the, other, language, in, italics, as, occurs, in, the, old, man, and, the, sea, or, in, english, as, literal, translations, in, general, he, avoided, complicated, syntax, about, 70, percent, of, the, sentences, are, simple, sentences, without, subordination, a, simple, childlike, grammar, structure, jackson, benson, believes, hemingway, used, autobiographical, details, as, framing, devices, about, life, in, general, not, only, about, his, life, for, example, benson, postulates, that, hemingway, used, his, experiences, and, drew, them, out, with, what, if, scenarios, what, if, i, were, wounded, in, such, a, way, that, i, could, not, sleep, at, night, what, if, i, were, wounded, and, made, crazy, what, would, happen, if, i, were, sent, back, to, the, front, writing, in, the, art, of, the, short, story, hemingway, explains, a, few, things, i, have, found, to, be, true, if, you, leave, out, important, things, or, events, that, you, know, about, the, story, is, strengthened, if, you, leave, or, skip, something, because, you, do, not, know, it, the, story, will, be, worthless, the, test, of, any, story, is, how, very, good, the, stuff, that, you, not, your, editors, omit, in, the, late, summer, that, year, we, lived, in, a, house, in, a, village, that, looked, across, the, river, and, the, plain, to, the, mountains, in, the, bed, of, the, river, there, were, pebbles, and, boulders, dry, and, white, in, the, sun, and, the, water, was, clear, and, swiftly, moving, and, blue, in, the, channels, troops, went, by, the, house, and, down, the, road, and, the, dust, they, raised, powdered, the, trees, opening, passage, of, a, farewell, to, arms, showing, hemingway, s, use, of, the, word, and, the, simplicity, of, the, prose, is, deceptive, zoe, trodd, believes, hemingway, crafted, skeletal, sentences, in, response, to, henry, james, s, observation, that, world, war, i, had, used, up, words, hemingway, offers, a, multi, focal, photographic, reality, his, iceberg, theory, of, omission, is, the, foundation, on, which, he, builds, the, syntax, which, lacks, subordinating, conjunctions, creates, static, sentences, the, photographic, snapshot, style, creates, a, collage, of, images, many, types, of, internal, punctuation, colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses, are, omitted, in, favor, of, short, declarative, sentences, the, sentences, build, on, each, other, as, events, build, to, create, a, sense, of, the, whole, multiple, strands, exist, in, one, story, an, embedded, text, bridges, to, a, different, angle, he, also, uses, other, cinematic, techniques, of, cutting, quickly, from, one, scene, to, the, next, or, of, splicing, a, scene, into, another, intentional, omissions, allow, the, reader, to, fill, the, gap, as, though, responding, to, instructions, from, the, author, and, create, three, dimensional, prose, conjunctions, such, as, and, are, habitually, used, in, place, of, commas, a, use, polysyndeton, that, conveys, immediacy, hemingway, s, polysyndetonic, sentence, or, in, later, works, his, use, of, subordinate, clauses, uses, conjunctions, to, juxtapose, startling, visions, and, images, benson, compares, them, to, haikus, many, of, hemingway, s, followers, misinterpreted, his, style, and, frowned, upon, expression, of, emotion, saul, bellow, satirized, this, style, as, do, you, have, emotions, strangle, them, hemingway, s, intent, was, not, to, eliminate, emotion, but, to, portray, it, realistically, as, he, explains, in, death, in, the, afternoon, in, writing, for, a, newspaper, you, told, what, happened, but, the, real, thing, the, sequence, of, motion, and, fact, which, made, the, emotion, and, which, would, be, as, valid, in, a, year, or, in, ten, years, or, with, luck, and, if, you, stated, it, purely, enough, always, was, beyond, me, he, tried, to, achieve, conveying, emotion, with, collages, of, images, this, use, of, an, image, as, an, objective, correlative, is, characteristic, of, ezra, pound, t, s, eliot, james, joyce, and, marcel, proust, hemingway, s, letters, refer, to, proust, s, remembrance, of, things, past, several, times, over, the, years, and, indicate, he, read, the, book, at, least, twice, hemingway, s, writing, includes, themes, of, love, war, travel, expatriation, wilderness, and, loss, critic, leslie, fiedler, sees, the, theme, he, defines, as, the, sacred, land, the, american, west, extended, in, hemingway, s, work, to, include, mountains, in, spain, switzerland, and, africa, and, to, the, streams, of, michigan, the, american, west, is, given, a, symbolic, nod, with, the, naming, of, the, hotel, montana, in, the, sun, also, rises, and, for, whom, the, bell, tolls, in, hemingway, s, expatriate, nationalism, jeffrey, herlihy, describes, hemingway, s, transnational, archetype, as, one, that, involves, characters, who, are, multilingual, and, bicultural, and, have, integrated, new, cultural, norms, from, the, host, community, into, their, daily, lives, by, the, time, plots, begin, in, this, way, foreign, scenarios, far, from, being, mere, exotic, backdrops, or, cosmopolitan, milieus, are, motivating, factors, in, character, action, in, hemingway, s, fiction, nature, is, a, place, for, rebirth, and, rest, it, is, where, the, hunter, or, fisherman, might, experience, a, moment, of, transcendence, at, the, moment, they, kill, their, prey, nature, is, where, men, exist, without, women, men, fish, men, hunt, men, find, redemption, in, nature, although, hemingway, does, write, about, sports, such, as, fishing, carlos, baker, notes, the, emphasis, is, more, on, the, athlete, than, the, sport, at, its, core, much, of, hemingway, s, work, can, be, viewed, in, the, light, of, american, naturalism, evident, in, detailed, descriptions, such, as, those, in, big, two, hearted, river, fiedler, notes, evil, a, dark, woman, contrasts, the, good, light, woman, the, dark, woman, brett, ashley, of, the, sun, also, rises, is, a, goddess, the, light, woman, margot, macomber, of, the, short, happy, life, of, francis, macomber, is, a, murderess, robert, scholes, says, early, hemingway, stories, such, as, a, very, short, story, present, a, male, character, favorably, and, a, female, unfavorably, according, to, rena, sanderson, early, hemingway, critics, lauded, his, male, centric, world, of, masculine, pursuits, and, the, fiction, divided, women, into, castrators, or, love, slaves, feminist, critics, attacked, hemingway, as, public, enemy, number, one, although, more, recent, re, evaluations, of, his, work, have, given, new, visibility, to, hemingway, s, female, characters, and, their, strengths, and, have, revealed, his, own, sensitivity, to, gender, issues, thus, casting, doubts, on, the, old, assumption, that, his, writings, were, one, sidedly, masculine, nina, baym, believes, that, brett, ashley, and, margot, macomber, are, the, two, outstanding, examples, of, hemingway, s, bitch, women, the, world, breaks, everyone, and, afterward, many, are, strong, in, the, broken, places, but, those, that, will, not, break, it, kills, it, kills, the, very, good, and, the, very, gentle, and, the, very, brave, impartially, if, you, are, none, of, these, you, can, be, sure, it, will, kill, you, too, but, there, will, be, no, special, hurry, ernest, hemingway, in, a, farewell, to, arms, death, permeates, much, of, hemingway, s, work, young, believes, the, death, in, indian, camp, was, not, so, much, on, the, father, who, kills, himself, but, on, nick, adams, who, witnesses, these, events, and, becomes, a, badly, scarred, and, nervous, young, man, young, believes, the, archetype, in, indian, camp, holds, the, master, key, to, what, its, author, was, up, to, for, some, thirty, five, years, of, his, writing, career, stoltzfus, considers, hemingway, s, work, to, be, more, complex, with, a, representation, of, the, truth, inherent, in, existentialism, if, nothingness, is, embraced, then, redemption, is, achieved, at, the, moment, of, death, those, who, face, death, with, dignity, and, courage, live, an, authentic, life, francis, macomber, dies, happy, because, the, last, hours, of, his, life, are, authentic, the, bullfighter, in, the, corrida, represents, the, pinnacle, of, a, life, lived, with, authenticity, in, his, paper, the, uses, of, authenticity, hemingway, and, the, literary, field, timo, m, ller, writes, that, hemingway, s, fiction, is, successful, because, the, characters, live, an, authentic, life, and, the, soldiers, fishers, boxers, and, backwoodsmen, are, among, the, archetypes, of, authenticity, in, modern, literature, emasculation, is, prevalent, in, hemingway, s, work, notably, in, god, rest, you, merry, gentlemen, and, the, sun, also, rises, emasculation, according, to, fiedler, is, a, result, of, a, generation, of, wounded, soldiers, and, of, a, generation, in, which, women, such, as, brett, gained, emancipation, this, also, applies, to, the, minor, character, frances, clyne, cohn, s, girlfriend, in, the, beginning, of, the, sun, also, rises, her, character, supports, the, theme, not, only, because, the, idea, was, presented, early, on, in, the, novel, but, also, the, impact, she, had, on, cohn, in, the, start, of, the, book, while, only, appearing, a, small, number, of, times, in, god, rest, you, merry, gentlemen, the, emasculation, is, literal, and, related, to, religious, guilt, baker, believes, hemingway, s, work, emphasizes, the, natural, versus, the, unnatural, in, an, alpine, idyll, the, unnaturalness, of, skiing, in, the, high, country, late, spring, snow, is, juxtaposed, against, the, unnaturalness, of, the, peasant, who, allowed, his, wife, s, dead, body, to, linger, too, long, in, the, shed, during, the, winter, the, skiers, and, peasant, retreat, to, the, valley, to, the, natural, spring, for, redemption, in, recent, decades, critics, have, characterized, hemingway, s, work, as, misogynistic, and, homophobic, susan, beegel, analyzed, four, decades, of, hemingway, criticism, and, found, that, critics, interested, in, multiculturalism, simply, ignored, hemingway, typical, is, this, analysis, of, the, sun, also, rises, hemingway, never, lets, the, reader, forget, that, cohn, is, a, jew, not, an, unattractive, character, who, happens, to, be, a, jew, but, a, character, who, is, unattractive, because, he, is, a, jew, during, the, same, decade, according, to, beegel, criticism, was, published, that, investigated, the, horror, of, homosexuality, and, racism, in, hemingway, s, fiction, in, an, overall, assessment, of, hemingway, s, work, beegel, has, written, throughout, his, remarkable, body, of, fiction, he, tells, the, truth, about, human, fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love, and, lust, hemingway, s, legacy, to, american, literature, is, his, style, writers, who, came, after, him, either, emulated, or, avoided, it, after, his, reputation, was, established, with, the, publication, of, the, sun, also, rises, he, became, the, spokesperson, for, the, post, world, war, i, generation, having, established, a, style, to, follow, his, books, were, burned, in, berlin, in, 1933, as, being, a, monument, of, modern, decadence, and, disavowed, by, his, parents, as, filth, reynolds, asserts, the, legacy, is, that, left, stories, and, novels, so, starkly, moving, that, some, have, become, part, of, our, cultural, heritage, benson, believes, the, details, of, hemingway, s, life, have, become, a, prime, vehicle, for, exploitation, resulting, in, a, hemingway, industry, the, hemingway, scholar, hallengren, believes, the, hard, boiled, style, and, the, machismo, must, be, separated, from, the, author, himself, benson, agrees, describing, him, as, introverted, and, private, as, j, d, salinger, although, hemingway, masked, his, nature, with, braggadocio, during, world, war, ii, salinger, met, and, corresponded, with, hemingway, whom, he, acknowledged, as, an, influence, in, a, letter, to, hemingway, salinger, claimed, their, talks, had, given, him, his, only, hopeful, minutes, of, the, entire, war, and, jokingly, named, himself, national, chairman, of, the, hemingway, fan, clubs, mary, hemingway,
