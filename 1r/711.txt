than, being, referred, to, as, mrs, putnam, when, the, new, york, times, referred, to, her, as, mrs, putnam, she, laughed, it, off, putnam, also, learned, he, would, be, called, mr, earhart, there, was, no, honeymoon, for, the, couple, because, earhart, was, involved, in, a, nine, day, cross, country, tour, promoting, autogyros, and, the, tour, s, sponsor, beech, nut, chewing, gum, earhart, and, putnam, never, had, children, but, putnam, had, two, sons, the, explorer, and, writer, david, binney, putnam, 1913, 1992, and, george, palmer, putnam, jr, 1921, 2013, from, his, previous, marriage, to, dorothy, binney, 1888, 1982, an, heir, to, her, father, s, chemical, company, binney, smith, on, may, 20, 1932, 34, year, old, earhart, set, off, from, harbour, grace, newfoundland, with, a, copy, of, the, telegraph, journal, given, to, her, by, journalist, stuart, trueman, to, confirm, the, date, of, the, flight, she, intended, to, fly, to, paris, in, her, single, engine, lockheed, vega, 5b, to, emulate, charles, lindbergh, s, solo, flight, five, years, earlier, her, technical, advisor, for, the, flight, was, the, norwegian, american, aviator, bernt, balchen, who, helped, prepare, her, aircraft, and, played, the, role, of, decoy, for, the, press, because, he, was, ostensibly, preparing, earhart, s, vega, for, his, own, arctic, flight, after, a, flight, lasting, 14, hours, 56, minutes, during, which, she, contended, with, strong, northerly, winds, icy, conditions, and, mechanical, problems, earhart, landed, in, a, pasture, at, culmore, north, of, derry, northern, ireland, the, landing, was, witnessed, by, cecil, king, and, t, sawyer, when, a, farm, hand, asked, have, you, flown, far, earhart, replied, from, america, as, the, first, woman, to, fly, solo, nonstop, across, the, atlantic, earhart, received, the, distinguished, flying, cross, from, congress, the, cross, of, knight, of, the, legion, of, honor, from, the, french, government, and, the, gold, medal, of, the, national, geographic, society, from, president, herbert, hoover, as, her, fame, grew, earhart, developed, friendships, with, many, people, in, high, offices, most, notably, first, lady, eleanor, roosevelt, who, shared, many, of, earhart, s, interests, especially, women, s, causes, after, flying, with, earhart, roosevelt, obtained, a, student, permit, but, did, not, further, pursue, her, plans, to, learn, to, fly, earhart, and, roosevelt, frequently, communicated, with, each, other, another, flyer, jacqueline, cochran, who, was, said, to, be, earhart, s, rival, also, became, her, confidante, during, this, period, on, january, 11, 1935, earhart, became, the, first, aviator, to, fly, solo, from, honolulu, hawaii, to, oakland, california, this, time, earhart, used, a, lockheed, 5c, vega, although, many, aviators, had, attempted, this, transoceanic, route, notably, by, the, unfortunate, participants, in, the, 1927, dole, air, race, that, had, reversed, the, route, earhart, s, flight, had, been, mainly, routine, with, no, mechanical, breakdowns, in, her, final, hours, she, relaxed, and, listened, to, the, broadcast, of, the, metropolitan, opera, from, new, york, on, april, 19, 1935, using, her, lockheed, vega, aircraft, that, she, had, named, old, bessie, the, fire, horse, earhart, flew, solo, from, los, angeles, to, mexico, city, earhart, s, next, record, attempt, was, a, nonstop, flight, from, mexico, city, to, new, york, after, she, set, off, on, may, 8, her, flight, was, uneventful, although, large, crowds, that, greeted, her, at, newark, new, jersey, were, a, concern, because, she, had, to, be, careful, not, to, taxi, into, them, earhart, again, participated, in, the, 1935, bendix, trophy, long, distance, air, race, finishing, fifth, the, best, result, she, could, manage, because, her, stock, lockheed, vega, whose, maximum, speed, was, 195, mph, 314, km, h, was, outclassed, by, purpose, built, aircraft, that, reached, more, than, 300, mph, 480, km, h, the, race, had, been, difficult, because, a, competitor, cecil, allen, died, in, a, fire, at, takeoff, and, jacqueline, cochran, was, forced, to, pull, out, due, to, mechanical, problems, in, addition, blinding, fog, and, violent, thunderstorms, plagued, the, race, between, 1930, and, 1935, earhart, set, seven, women, s, speed, and, distance, aviation, records, in, a, variety, of, aircraft, including, the, kinner, airster, lockheed, vega, and, pitcairn, autogiro, by, 1935, recognizing, the, limitations, of, her, lovely, red, vega, in, long, transoceanic, flights, earhart, contemplated, a, new, prize, one, flight, which, i, most, wanted, to, attempt, a, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, as, near, its, waistline, as, could, be, for, the, new, venture, she, would, need, a, new, aircraft, in, late, november, 1934, while, earhart, was, away, on, a, speaking, tour, a, fire, broke, out, at, the, putnam, residence, in, rye, destroying, many, family, treasures, and, earhart, s, personal, mementos, putnam, had, already, sold, his, interest, in, the, new, york, based, publishing, company, to, his, cousin, palmer, putnam, following, the, fire, the, couple, decided, to, move, to, the, west, coast, where, putnam, took, up, his, new, position, as, head, of, the, editorial, board, of, paramount, pictures, in, north, hollywood, at, earhart, s, urging, in, june, 1935, putnam, purchased, a, small, house, in, toluca, lake, a, san, fernando, valley, celebrity, enclave, community, between, the, warner, brothers, and, universal, pictures, studio, complexes, where, they, had, earlier, rented, a, temporary, residence, in, september, 1935, earhart, and, paul, mantz, established, a, business, partnership, they, had, been, considering, since, late, 1934, and, established, the, short, lived, earhart, mantz, flying, school, which, mantz, controlled, and, operated, through, his, aviation, company, united, air, services, which, was, based, at, burbank, airport, putnam, handled, publicity, for, the, school, which, primarily, taught, instrument, flying, using, link, trainers, also, in, 1935, earhart, joined, purdue, university, as, a, visiting, faculty, member, to, counsel, women, on, careers, and, as, a, technical, advisor, to, its, department, of, aeronautics, early, in, 1936, earhart, started, planning, to, fly, around, the, world, if, she, succeeded, she, would, become, the, first, woman, to, do, so, although, others, had, flown, around, the, world, earhart, s, flight, would, be, the, longest, at, 29, 000, miles, 47, 000, km, because, it, followed, a, roughly, equatorial, route, earhart, planned, to, court, publicity, along, the, route, to, increase, interest, in, a, planned, book, about, the, expedition, purdue, university, established, the, amelia, earhart, fund, for, aeronautical, research, and, gave, 50, 000, to, fund, the, purchase, of, a, lockheed, electra, 10e, airplane, in, july, 1936, lockheed, aircraft, company, built, the, airplane, which, was, fitted, with, extra, fuel, tanks, and, other, extensive, modifications, earhart, dubbed, the, twin, engine, monoplane, her, flying, laboratory, the, plane, was, built, at, lockheed, s, plant, in, burbank, california, and, after, delivery, it, was, hangared, at, the, nearby, mantz, s, united, air, services, earhart, chose, harry, manning, as, her, navigator, he, had, been, the, captain, of, the, president, roosevelt, the, ship, that, had, transported, earhart, from, europe, in, 1928, manning, was, also, a, pilot, and, a, skilled, radio, operator, who, knew, morse, code, the, original, plan, was, a, two, person, crew, earhart, would, fly, and, manning, would, navigate, during, a, flight, across, the, us, that, included, earhart, manning, and, putnam, earhart, flew, using, landmarks, she, and, putnam, knew, where, they, were, manning, did, a, navigation, fix, that, alarmed, putnam, because, manning, made, a, minor, navigational, error, that, put, them, in, the, wrong, state, they, were, flying, close, to, the, state, line, but, putnam, was, still, concerned, sometime, later, putnam, and, mantz, arranged, a, night, flight, to, test, manning, s, navigational, skill, under, poor, navigational, conditions, manning, s, position, was, off, by, 20, miles, 32, km, elgen, m, and, marie, k, long, considered, manning, s, performance, reasonable, because, it, was, within, an, acceptable, error, of, 30, miles, 48, km, but, mantz, and, putnam, wanted, a, better, navigator, through, contacts, in, the, los, angeles, aviation, community, fred, noonan, was, chosen, as, a, second, navigator, because, there, were, significant, additional, factors, that, had, to, be, dealt, with, while, using, celestial, navigation, for, aircraft, noonan, a, licensed, ship, s, captain, was, experienced, in, both, marine, and, flight, navigation, he, had, recently, left, pan, american, world, airways, pan, am, where, he, established, most, of, the, company, s, china, clipper, seaplane, routes, across, the, pacific, noonan, had, also, been, responsible, for, training, pan, american, s, navigators, to, fly, the, route, between, san, francisco, and, manila, under, the, original, plans, noonan, would, navigate, from, hawaii, to, howland, island, a, difficult, portion, of, the, flight, then, manning, would, continue, with, earhart, to, australia, and, she, would, proceed, on, her, own, for, the, remainder, of, the, project, on, march, 17, 1937, earhart, and, her, crew, set, out, on, the, first, leg, of, her, round, the, world, flight, but, they, abandoned, this, attempt, after, a, non, fatal, crash, that, damaged, the, aircraft, the, first, leg, of, this, attempt, was, between, oakland, california, and, honolulu, hawaii, the, crew, were, earhart, noonan, manning, and, mantz, who, was, acting, as, earhart, s, technical, advisor, due, to, problems, with, the, propeller, hubs, variable, pitch, mechanisms, the, aircraft, needed, servicing, and, was, taken, to, the, united, states, navy, s, luke, field, facility, at, pearl, harbor, the, flight, resumed, three, days, later, from, luke, field, with, earhart, noonan, and, manning, on, board, the, next, destination, was, howland, island, a, small, island, in, the, pacific, manning, the, radio, operator, had, made, arrangements, to, use, radio, direction, finding, to, home, in, to, the, island, the, flight, never, left, luke, field, during, the, takeoff, run, there, was, an, uncontrolled, ground, loop, the, forward, landing, gear, collapsed, both, propellers, hit, the, ground, and, the, plane, skidded, on, its, belly, the, cause, of, the, crash, is, not, known, some, witnesses, at, luke, field, including, an, associated, press, journalist, said, they, saw, a, tire, blow, earhart, earlier, thought, the, electra, s, right, tire, had, blown, and, the, right, landing, gear, had, collapsed, some, sources, including, mantz, cited, an, error, by, earhart, with, the, aircraft, severely, damaged, the, attempt, was, abandoned, and, the, aircraft, was, shipped, to, lockheed, burbank, california, for, repairs, while, the, electra, was, being, repaired, earhart, and, putnam, secured, additional, funds, and, prepared, for, a, second, attempt, in, which, they, would, fly, west, to, east, the, second, attempt, began, with, an, unpublicized, flight, from, oakland, to, miami, florida, and, after, arriving, there, earhart, announced, her, plans, to, circumnavigate, the, globe, the, flight, s, opposite, direction, was, partly, the, result, of, changes, in, global, wind, and, weather, patterns, along, the, planned, route, since, the, earlier, attempt, manning, the, only, skilled, radio, operator, had, left, the, crew, which, now, consisted, of, noonan, and, earhart, the, pair, departed, miami, on, june, 1, and, after, numerous, stops, in, south, america, africa, the, indian, subcontinent, and, southeast, asia, arrived, at, lae, new, guinea, on, june, 29, 1937, at, this, stage, about, 22, 000, miles, 35, 000, km, of, the, journey, had, been, completed, the, remaining, 7, 000, miles, 11, 000, km, would, be, over, the, pacific, on, july, 2, 1937, at, 10, 00, am, local, time, 12, 00, am, gmt, earhart, and, noonan, took, off, from, lae, airfield, in, the, heavily, loaded, electra, their, destination, was, howland, island, a, flat, sliver, of, land, 6, 500, ft, 2, 000, m, long, and, 1, 600, ft, 500, m, wide, 10, ft, 3, m, high, and, 2, 556, miles, 2, 221, nmi, 4, 113, km, away, the, expected, flying, time, was, about, 20, hours, accounting, for, the, two, hour, time, zone, difference, between, lae, and, howland, and, the, crossing, of, the, international, date, line, the, aircraft, was, expected, to, arrive, at, howland, the, morning, of, the, next, day, 2, july, the, aircraft, departed, lae, with, about, 1, 100, u, s, gallons, 4, 200, liters, of, gasoline, in, preparation, for, the, trip, to, howland, island, the, u, s, coast, guard, had, sent, the, cutter, uscgc, itasca, 1929, to, the, island, to, offer, communication, and, navigation, support, for, the, flight, the, cutter, was, to, communicate, with, earhart, s, aircraft, via, radio, transmit, a, homing, signal, to, help, the, aviators, locate, howland, island, use, radio, direction, finding, rdf, and, use, the, cutter, s, boilers, to, create, a, dark, column, of, smoke, that, could, be, seen, over, the, horizon, all, of, the, navigation, methods, failed, to, guide, earhart, to, howland, island, around, 3, pm, lae, time, earhart, reported, her, altitude, as, 10, 000, ft, 3, 000, m, but, that, they, would, reduce, altitude, due, to, thick, clouds, around, 5, pm, earhart, reported, her, altitude, as, 7, 000, ft, 2, 100, m, and, speed, as, 150, kn, 280, km, h, 170, mph, during, earhart, s, and, noonan, s, approach, to, howland, island, itasca, received, strong, clear, voice, transmissions, from, earhart, identifying, as, khaqq, but, she, was, unable, to, hear, voice, transmissions, from, the, ship, the, first, calls, received, from, earhart, were, routine, reports, stating, the, weather, was, cloudy, and, overcast, at, 2, 45, am, and, just, before, 5, am, on, july, 2, these, calls, were, broken, up, by, static, but, at, this, point, the, aircraft, was, a, long, distance, from, howland, at, 6, 14, am, another, call, was, received, stating, that, the, aircraft, was, within, 200, miles, 320, km, and, requesting, that, the, ship, use, its, direction, finder, to, provide, a, bearing, for, the, aircraft, earhart, began, whistling, into, the, microphone, to, provide, a, continuous, signal, for, the, ship, s, crew, to, use, at, this, point, the, radio, operators, on, itasca, realized, their, rdf, system, could, not, tune, into, the, aircraft, s, signal, on, 3105, khz, radioman, leo, bellarts, later, commented, he, was, sitting, there, sweating, blood, because, i, couldn, t, do, a, darn, thing, about, it, a, similar, call, asking, for, a, bearing, was, received, at, 6, 45, am, when, earhart, estimated, they, were, 100, miles, 160, km, away, an, itasca, radio, log, at, 7, 30, 7, 40, am, states, the, aircraft, had, only, a, half, hour, of, fuel, remaining, a, further, radio, log, states, they, thought, they, were, near, itasca, but, could, not, locate, it, and, were, flying, at, 1, 000, ft, 300, m, in, her, transmission, at, 7, 58, am, earhart, said, she, could, not, hear, itasca, and, asked, them, to, send, voice, signals, so, she, could, try, to, take, a, radio, bearing, itasca, reported, this, signal, as, the, loudest, possible, signal, indicating, earhart, and, noonan, were, in, the, immediate, area, the, ship, could, not, send, voice, at, the, frequency, she, asked, for, so, they, sent, morse, code, signals, instead, earhart, acknowledged, receiving, these, but, said, she, was, unable, to, determine, their, direction, the, last, voice, transmission, received, on, howland, island, from, earhart, indicated, she, and, noonan, were, flying, along, a, line, of, position, running, north, to, south, on, 157, 337, degrees, which, noonan, would, have, calculated, and, drawn, on, a, chart, as, passing, through, howland, after, all, contact, with, howland, island, was, lost, attempts, to, reach, the, flyers, with, voice, and, morse, code, transmissions, were, made, operators, across, the, pacific, and, in, the, united, states, may, have, heard, signals, from, the, electra, but, these, were, weak, or, unintelligible, a, series, of, misunderstandings, errors, or, mechanical, failures, are, likely, to, have, occurred, on, the, final, approach, to, howland, island, noonan, had, earlier, written, about, problems, affecting, the, accuracy, of, rdf, in, navigation, another, cited, cause, of, possible, confusion, was, that, itasca, and, earhart, planned, their, communication, schedule, using, time, systems, set, a, half, hour, apart, earhart, was, using, greenwich, civil, time, gct, and, itasca, was, using, a, naval, time, zone, designation, system, sources, have, noted, earhart, s, apparent, lack, of, understanding, of, her, direction, finding, system, which, had, been, fitted, to, the, aircraft, just, prior, to, the, flight, the, system, was, equipped, with, a, new, receiver, from, bendix, corporation, earhart, s, only, training, on, the, system, was, a, brief, introduction, by, joe, gurr, at, the, lockheed, factory, a, card, displaying, the, antenna, s, band, settings, was, mounted, so, it, was, not, visible, the, electra, expected, itasca, to, transmit, signals, the, electra, could, use, as, an, rdf, beacon, to, find, the, ship, in, theory, the, plane, could, listen, for, the, signal, while, rotating, its, loop, antenna, a, sharp, minimum, indicates, the, direction, of, the, rdf, beacon, the, electra, s, rdf, equipment, had, failed, due, to, a, blown, fuse, during, an, earlier, leg, flying, to, darwin, the, fuse, was, replaced, near, howland, earhart, could, hear, the, transmission, from, itasca, on, 7500, khz, but, she, was, unable, to, determine, a, minimum, so, she, could, not, determine, a, direction, to, the, ship, earhart, was, also, unable, to, determine, a, minimum, during, an, rdf, test, at, lae, the, u, s, government, investigated, the, aircraft, s, disappearance, and, in, its, report, concluded, earhart, s, plane, ran, out, of, fuel, and, crashed, into, the, ocean, during, the, 1970s, retired, united, states, navy, usn, captain, laurance, safford, began, a, lengthy, analysis, of, the, flight, his, research, included, the, intricate, radio, transmission, documentation, safford, concluded, the, flight, had, suffered, from, poor, planning, and, worse, execution, many, researchers, believe, earhart, and, noonan, died, during, or, shortly, after, the, crash, in, 1982, retired, usn, rear, admiral, richard, r, black, who, was, in, administrative, charge, of, the, howland, island, airstrip, and, was, present, in, the, radio, room, on, itasca, said, the, electra, went, into, the, sea, about, 10, am, july, 2, 1937, not, far, from, howland, earhart, s, stepson, george, palmer, putnam, jr, has, said, he, believes, the, plane, just, ran, out, of, gas, according, to, earhart, biography, author, susan, butler, the, aircraft, went, into, the, ocean, out, of, sight, of, howland, island, and, rests, on, the, seafloor, at, a, depth, of, 17, 000, ft, 5, km, tom, d, crouch, senior, curator, of, the, national, air, and, space, museum, has, said, the, electra, is, 18, 000, ft, down, and, compared, its, archaeological, significance, to, that, of, rms, titanic, british, aviation, historian, roy, nesbit, interpreted, evidence, in, contemporary, accounts, and, putnam, s, correspondence, and, concluded, earhart, s, electra, was, not, fully, fueled, at, lae, william, l, polhemous, the, navigator, on, ann, pellegreno, s, 1967, flight, that, followed, earhart, and, noonan, s, original, flight, path, studied, navigational, tables, for, july, 2, 1937, and, thought, noonan, may, have, miscalculated, the, single, line, approach, to, howland, beginning, approximately, one, hour, after, earhart, s, last, recorded, message, itasca, undertook, an, unsuccessful, search, north, and, west, of, howland, island, based, on, initial, assumptions, about, transmissions, from, the, aircraft, the, u, s, navy, joined, the, search, and, over, about, three, days, sent, available, resources, to, the, search, area, near, howland, island, official, search, efforts, lasted, until, july, 19, 1937, at, 4, million, the, air, and, sea, search, by, the, u, s, navy, and, coast, guard, was, the, costliest, and, most, intensive, in, u, s, history, up, to, that, time, despite, the, unprecedented, search, no, physical, evidence, of, earhart, noonan, or, the, electra, 10e, was, found, on, the, mornings, of, july, 3, and, july, 6, 1937, an, oakland, radio, amateur, was, reported, to, have, heard, emergency, transmissions, seemingly, from, earhart, in, the, days, after, their, last, confirmed, transmissions, further, transmissions, purporting, to, be, from, earhart, were, reported, many, of, which, were, determined, to, be, hoaxes, the, captain, of, uss, colorado, later, said, there, was, no, doubt, many, stations, calling, the, earhart, plane, on, the, plane, s, frequency, some, by, voice, and, others, by, signals, all, of, these, added, to, the, confusion, and, doubtfulness, of, the, authenticity, of, the, reports, immediately, after, the, end, of, the, official, search, putnam, financed, a, private, search, by, local, authorities, of, nearby, pacific, islands, and, waters, in, late, july, 1937, putnam, chartered, two, small, boats, and, while, he, remained, in, the, united, states, directed, a, search, of, other, islands, putnam, acted, to, become, the, trustee, of, earhart, s, estate, so, he, could, pay, for, the, searches, and, related, bills, in, probate, court, in, los, angeles, putnam, asked, to, have, the, declared, death, in, absentia, seven, year, waiting, period, waived, so, he, could, manage, earhart, s, finances, as, a, result, earhart, was, declared, legally, dead, on, january, 5, 1939, in, 2003, and, 2006, david, jourdan, through, his, company, nauticos, extensively, searched, a, 1, 200, square, mile, 3, 100, km, 2, area, north, and, west, of, howland, island, with, deep, sea, sonar, devices, the, searches, cost, 4, 5, million, but, did, not, find, any, wreckage, the, search, locations, were, derived, from, the, line, of, position, 157, 337, broadcast, by, earhart, on, july, 2, 1937, in, a, potentially, significant, discovery, in, 2024, deep, sea, vision, a, charleston, south, carolina, company, that, operates, unmanned, underwater, vehicles, found, via, sonar, what, it, said, are, the, remains, of, an, airplane, on, the, ocean, floor, using, advanced, underwater, exploration, technologies, including, synthetic, aperture, sonar, sas, they, detected, an, object, resembling, an, electra, airplane, approximately, 16, 000, ft, 4, 9, km, beneath, the, ocean, s, surface, within, 100, mi, 160, km, of, howland, island, the, object, s, location, size, proportions, and, defined, edges, on, an, otherwise, sandy, bottom, indicate, that, it, may, be, earhart, s, missing, plane, however, further, exploration, is, needed, for, confirmation, at, a, july, 20, 2024, presentation, at, the, amelia, earhart, hangar, museum, the, founders, of, deep, sea, vision, said, they, planned, to, send, a, follow, up, mission, provisionally,
