two, operas, one, of, his, first, and, most, popular, pieces, the, maple, leaf, rag, became, the, genre, s, first, and, most, influential, hit, later, being, recognized, as, the, quintessential, rag, joplin, considered, ragtime, to, be, a, form, of, classical, music, meant, to, be, played, in, concert, halls, and, largely, disdained, the, performance, of, ragtime, as, honky, tonk, music, most, common, in, saloons, joplin, grew, up, in, a, musical, family, of, railway, laborers, in, texarkana, arkansas, during, the, late, 1880s, he, traveled, the, american, south, as, a, musician, he, went, to, chicago, for, the, world, s, fair, of, 1893, which, helped, make, ragtime, a, national, craze, by, 1897, joplin, moved, to, sedalia, missouri, in, 1894, and, worked, as, a, piano, teacher, he, began, publishing, music, in, 1895, and, his, maple, leaf, rag, in, 1899, brought, him, fame, and, eventually, a, steady, income, in, 1901, joplin, moved, to, st, louis, and, two, years, later, scored, his, first, opera, a, guest, of, honor, it, was, confiscated, along, with, his, belongings, for, non, payment, of, bills, and, is, now, considered, lost, in, 1907, joplin, moved, to, new, york, city, to, unsuccessfully, find, a, producer, for, a, new, opera, in, 1916, joplin, descended, into, dementia, from, neurosyphilis, his, 1917, death, marks, the, end, of, the, ragtime, era, joplin, s, music, was, rediscovered, and, returned, to, popularity, in, the, early, 1970s, with, the, release, of, a, million, selling, album, recorded, by, joshua, rifkin, this, was, followed, by, the, academy, award, winning, 1973, film, the, sting, which, featured, several, of, joplin, s, compositions, treemonisha, his, second, opera, was, produced, in, 1972, and, in, 1976, joplin, was, awarded, a, pulitzer, prize, joplin, was, the, second, of, six, children, born, to, giles, joplin, a, former, slave, from, north, carolina, and, florence, givens, a, freeborn, african, american, woman, from, kentucky, his, birth, date, was, accepted, by, early, biographers, rudi, blesh, and, james, haskins, as, november, 24, 1868, although, later, biographer, edward, a, berlin, showed, this, was, almost, certainly, incorrect, there, is, disagreement, over, his, exact, place, of, birth, in, texas, with, blesh, identifying, texarkana, and, berlin, showing, the, earliest, record, of, joplin, being, the, june, 1870, census, which, locates, him, in, linden, as, a, two, year, old, by, 1880, the, joplins, moved, to, texarkana, arkansas, where, giles, worked, as, a, railroad, laborer, and, florence, as, a, cleaner, as, joplin, s, father, had, played, the, violin, for, plantation, parties, in, north, carolina, and, his, mother, sang, and, played, the, banjo, joplin, was, given, a, rudimentary, musical, education, by, his, family, and, from, the, age, of, seven, he, was, allowed, to, play, the, piano, while, his, mother, cleaned, at, some, point, in, the, early, 1880s, giles, joplin, left, the, family, for, another, woman, and, florence, struggled, to, support, her, children, through, domestic, work, biographer, susan, curtis, speculates, that, florence, s, support, of, her, son, s, musical, education, was, a, critical, factor, behind, her, separation, from, giles, who, wanted, the, boy, to, pursue, practical, employment, that, would, supplement, the, family, income, at, the, age, of, 16, joplin, performed, in, a, vocal, quartet, with, three, other, boys, in, and, around, texarkana, also, playing, piano, he, also, taught, guitar, and, mandolin, according, to, a, family, friend, the, young, joplin, was, serious, and, ambitious, studying, music, and, playing, the, piano, after, school, while, a, few, local, teachers, aided, him, he, received, most, of, his, musical, education, from, julius, weiss, a, german, born, american, jewish, music, professor, who, had, immigrated, to, texas, in, the, late, 1860s, and, was, employed, as, music, tutor, by, a, prominent, local, business, family, weiss, as, described, by, san, diego, jewish, world, writer, eric, george, tauber, was, no, stranger, to, race, hatred, as, a, jew, in, germany, he, was, often, slapped, and, called, a, christ, killer, weiss, had, studied, music, at, a, german, university, and, was, listed, in, town, records, as, a, professor, of, music, impressed, by, joplin, s, talent, and, realizing, the, joplin, family, s, dire, straits, weiss, taught, him, free, of, charge, while, tutoring, joplin, from, the, ages, of, 11, to, 16, weiss, introduced, him, to, folk, and, classical, music, including, opera, weiss, helped, joplin, appreciate, music, as, an, art, as, well, as, an, entertainment, and, helped, florence, acquire, a, used, piano, according, to, joplin, s, widow, lottie, joplin, never, forgot, weiss, in, his, later, years, after, achieving, fame, as, a, composer, joplin, sent, his, former, teacher, gifts, of, money, when, he, was, old, and, ill, until, weiss, died, in, the, late, 1880s, having, performed, at, various, local, events, as, a, teenager, joplin, gave, up, his, job, as, a, railroad, laborer, and, left, texarkana, to, become, a, traveling, musician, little, is, known, about, his, movements, at, this, time, although, he, is, recorded, in, texarkana, in, july, 1891, as, a, member, of, the, texarkana, minstrels, who, were, raising, money, for, a, monument, to, jefferson, davis, president, of, the, former, confederate, states, of, america, however, joplin, soon, learned, that, there, were, few, opportunities, for, black, pianists, churches, and, brothels, were, among, the, few, options, for, steady, work, joplin, played, pre, ragtime, jig, piano, in, various, red, light, districts, throughout, the, mid, south, and, some, claim, he, was, in, sedalia, and, st, louis, missouri, during, this, time, in, 1893, while, in, chicago, for, the, world, s, fair, joplin, formed, a, band, in, which, he, played, cornet, and, also, arranged, the, band, s, music, although, the, world, s, fair, minimized, the, involvement, of, african, americans, black, performers, still, came, to, the, saloons, caf, s, and, brothels, that, lined, the, fair, the, exposition, was, attended, by, 27, million, visitors, and, had, a, profound, effect, on, many, areas, of, american, cultural, life, including, ragtime, although, specific, information, is, sparse, numerous, sources, have, credited, the, chicago, world, s, fair, with, spreading, the, popularity, of, ragtime, joplin, found, that, his, music, as, well, as, that, of, other, black, performers, was, popular, with, visitors, by, 1897, ragtime, had, become, a, national, craze, in, u, s, cities, and, was, described, by, the, st, louis, dispatch, as, a, veritable, call, of, the, wild, which, mightily, stirred, the, pulses, of, city, bred, people, in, 1894, joplin, arrived, in, sedalia, missouri, at, first, joplin, stayed, with, the, family, of, arthur, marshall, a, 13, year, old, boy, who, later, became, one, of, joplin, s, students, and, a, ragtime, composer, in, his, own, right, there, is, no, record, of, joplin, having, a, residence, in, the, town, until, 1904, as, joplin, was, making, a, living, as, a, touring, musician, there, is, little, precise, evidence, known, about, joplin, s, activities, at, this, time, although, he, performed, as, a, solo, musician, at, dances, and, at, the, major, black, clubs, in, sedalia, the, black, 400, club, and, the, maple, leaf, club, he, performed, in, the, queen, city, cornet, band, and, his, own, six, piece, dance, orchestra, a, tour, with, his, own, singing, group, the, texas, medley, quartet, gave, him, his, first, opportunity, to, publish, his, own, compositions, and, it, is, known, that, he, went, to, syracuse, new, york, and, texas, three, businessmen, from, syracuse, m, l, mantell, and, the, leiter, brothers, published, joplin, s, first, two, works, the, songs, please, say, you, will, and, a, picture, of, her, face, in, 1895, joplin, s, visit, to, temple, texas, enabled, him, to, have, three, pieces, published, there, in, 1896, including, the, great, crush, collision, march, which, commemorated, a, planned, train, crash, on, the, missouri, kansas, texas, railroad, on, september, 15, that, he, may, have, witnessed, the, march, was, described, by, one, of, joplin, s, biographers, as, a, special, early, essay, in, ragtime, while, in, sedalia, joplin, taught, piano, to, students, who, included, future, ragtime, composers, arthur, marshall, brun, campbell, and, scott, hayden, joplin, enrolled, at, the, george, r, smith, college, where, he, apparently, studied, advanced, harmony, and, composition, the, college, s, records, were, destroyed, in, a, fire, in, 1925, and, biographer, edward, a, berlin, notes, that, it, was, unlikely, that, a, small, college, for, african, americans, would, be, able, to, provide, such, a, course, although, there, were, hundreds, of, rags, in, print, by, the, time, the, maple, leaf, rag, was, published, joplin, was, not, far, behind, he, completed, his, first, published, rag, original, rags, in, 1897, the, same, year, that, the, first, ragtime, work, appeared, in, print, the, mississippi, rag, by, william, krell, the, maple, leaf, rag, was, likely, to, have, been, known, in, sedalia, before, its, publication, in, 1899, brun, campbell, claimed, to, have, seen, the, manuscript, of, the, work, in, around, 1898, the, exact, circumstances, that, led, to, the, publication, of, the, maple, leaf, rag, are, unknown, and, a, number, of, versions, of, the, event, contradict, each, other, after, several, unsuccessful, approaches, to, publishers, joplin, signed, a, contract, on, august, 10, 1899, with, john, stillwell, stark, a, retailer, of, musical, instruments, who, became, his, most, important, publisher, the, contract, stipulated, that, joplin, would, receive, a, 1, royalty, on, all, sales, of, the, rag, with, a, minimum, sales, price, of, 25, cents, with, the, inscription, to, the, maple, leaf, club, prominently, visible, along, the, top, of, at, least, some, editions, it, is, likely, that, the, rag, was, named, after, the, maple, leaf, club, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, prove, the, link, and, there, were, many, other, possible, sources, for, the, name, in, and, around, sedalia, at, the, time, there, have, been, many, claims, about, the, sales, of, the, maple, leaf, rag, one, being, that, joplin, was, the, first, musician, to, sell, 1, million, copies, of, a, piece, of, instrumental, music, joplin, s, first, biographer, rudi, blesh, wrote, that, during, its, first, six, months, the, piece, sold, 75, 000, copies, and, became, the, first, great, instrumental, sheet, music, hit, in, america, however, research, by, joplin, s, later, biographer, edward, a, berlin, demonstrated, that, this, was, not, the, case, the, initial, print, run, of, 400, took, one, year, to, sell, and, under, the, terms, of, joplin, s, contract, with, a, 1, royalty, would, have, given, joplin, an, income, of, 4, or, approximately, 146, at, current, prices, later, sales, were, steady, and, would, have, given, joplin, an, income, that, would, have, covered, his, expenses, in, 1909, estimated, sales, would, have, given, him, an, income, of, 600, annually, approximately, 16, 968, in, current, prices, the, maple, leaf, rag, did, serve, as, a, model, for, the, hundreds, of, rags, to, come, from, future, composers, especially, in, the, development, of, classic, ragtime, after, the, publication, of, the, maple, leaf, rag, joplin, was, soon, being, described, as, king, of, rag, time, writers, not, least, by, himself, on, the, covers, of, his, own, work, such, as, the, easy, winners, and, elite, syncopations, during, his, time, in, st, louis, joplin, collaborated, with, scott, hayden, in, the, composition, of, four, rags, it, was, in, st, louis, that, joplin, produced, some, of, his, best, known, works, including, the, entertainer, march, majestic, and, the, short, theatrical, work, the, ragtime, dance, in, 1901, joplin, married, his, first, wife, belle, jones, 1875, 1903, a, sister, in, law, of, scott, hayden, by, 1903, the, joplins, had, moved, to, a, 13, room, house, renting, some, of, the, rooms, to, lodgers, who, included, pianist, composers, arthur, marshall, and, scott, hayden, joplin, did, not, work, as, a, pianist, in, the, saloons, in, st, louis, which, was, usually, a, major, source, of, income, for, musicians, as, he, was, probably, outclassed, by, the, competition, and, was, according, to, stark, s, son, a, mediocre, pianist, biographer, berlin, speculated, that, by, 1903, joplin, was, already, showing, early, signs, of, syphilis, which, reduced, his, coordination, and, pianistic, skills, in, 1903, joplin, s, only, child, a, daughter, died, joplin, and, his, first, wife, drifted, apart, in, june, 1904, joplin, married, freddie, alexander, of, little, rock, arkansas, the, young, woman, to, whom, he, had, dedicated, the, chrysanthemum, she, died, on, september, 10, 1904, of, complications, resulting, from, a, cold, ten, weeks, after, their, wedding, bethena, joplin, s, first, work, copyrighted, after, freddie, s, death, was, described, by, one, biographer, as, an, enchantingly, beautiful, piece, that, is, among, the, greatest, of, ragtime, waltzes, during, this, time, joplin, created, an, opera, company, of, 30, people, and, produced, his, first, opera, a, guest, of, honor, for, a, national, tour, it, is, not, certain, how, many, productions, were, staged, or, even, whether, this, was, an, all, black, show, or, a, racially, mixed, production, during, the, tour, either, in, springfield, illinois, or, pittsburg, kansas, someone, associated, with, the, company, stole, the, box, office, receipts, joplin, could, not, meet, the, company, s, payroll, or, pay, for, its, lodgings, at, a, theatrical, boarding, house, it, is, believed, that, the, score, for, a, guest, of, honor, was, lost, and, perhaps, destroyed, because, of, non, payment, of, the, company, s, boarding, house, bill, in, 1907, joplin, moved, to, new, york, city, which, he, believed, was, the, best, place, to, find, a, producer, for, a, new, opera, after, his, move, to, new, york, joplin, met, lottie, stokes, whom, he, married, in, 1909, in, 1911, unable, to, find, a, publisher, joplin, undertook, the, financial, burden, of, publishing, treemonisha, himself, in, piano, vocal, format, in, 1915, as, a, last, ditch, effort, to, see, it, performed, he, invited, a, small, audience, to, hear, it, at, a, rehearsal, hall, in, harlem, poorly, staged, and, with, only, joplin, on, piano, accompaniment, it, was, a, miserable, failure, to, a, public, not, ready, for, crude, black, musical, forms, so, different, from, the, european, grand, opera, of, that, time, the, audience, including, potential, backers, was, indifferent, and, walked, out, scott, writes, that, after, a, disastrous, single, performance, joplin, suffered, a, breakdown, he, was, bankrupt, discouraged, and, worn, out, he, concludes, that, few, american, artists, of, his, generation, faced, such, obstacles, treemonisha, went, unnoticed, and, unreviewed, largely, because, joplin, had, abandoned, commercial, music, in, favor, of, art, music, a, field, closed, to, african, americans, it, was, not, until, the, 1970s, that, the, opera, received, a, full, theatrical, staging, in, 1914, joplin, and, lottie, self, published, his, magnetic, rag, as, the, scott, joplin, music, company, which, he, had, formed, the, previous, december, biographer, vera, brodsky, lawrence, speculates, that, joplin, was, aware, of, his, advancing, deterioration, due, to, syphilis, and, was, consciously, racing, against, time, in, her, sleeve, notes, on, the, 1992, deutsche, grammophon, release, of, treemonisha, she, notes, that, he, plunged, feverishly, into, the, task, of, orchestrating, his, opera, day, and, night, with, his, friend, sam, patterson, standing, by, to, copy, out, the, parts, page, by, page, as, each, page, of, the, full, score, was, completed, by, 1916, joplin, had, developed, tertiary, syphilis, but, more, specifically, it, was, likely, neurosyphilis, on, february, 2, 1917, he, was, admitted, to, manhattan, state, hospital, a, mental, institution, the, king, of, ragtime, died, there, on, april, 1, of, syphilitic, dementia, at, the, age, of, 48, and, was, buried, in, a, pauper, s, grave, that, remained, unmarked, for, 57, years, his, grave, located, at, st, michael, s, cemetery, in, east, elmhurst, was, finally, given, a, marker, in, 1974, the, year, the, sting, which, showcased, his, music, won, best, picture, at, the, oscars, the, combination, of, classical, music, the, musical, atmosphere, present, around, texarkana, including, work, songs, gospel, hymns, spirituals, and, dance, music, and, joplin, s, natural, ability, have, been, cited, as, contributing, to, the, invention, of, ragtime, a, new, style, that, blended, african, american, musical, styles, with, european, forms, and, melodies, and, first, became, celebrated, in, the, 1890s, when, joplin, was, learning, the, piano, serious, musical, circles, condemned, ragtime, because, of, its, association, with, the, vulgar, and, inane, songs, cranked, out, by, the, tune, smiths, of, tin, pan, alley, as, a, composer, joplin, refined, ragtime, elevating, it, above, the, low, and, unrefined, form, played, by, the, wandering, honky, tonk, pianists, playing, mere, dance, music, of, popular, imagination, this, new, art, form, the, classic, rag, combined, afro, american, folk, music, s, syncopation, and, 19th, century, european, romanticism, with, its, harmonic, schemes, and, its, march, like, tempos, in, the, words, of, one, critic, ragtime, was, basically, an, afro, american, version, of, the, polka, or, its, analog, the, sousa, style, march, with, this, as, a, foundation, joplin, intended, his, compositions, to, be, played, exactly, as, he, wrote, them, without, improvisation, joplin, wrote, his, rags, as, classical, music, in, miniature, form, in, order, to, raise, ragtime, above, its, cheap, bordello, origins, and, produced, work, that, opera, historian, elise, kirk, described, as, more, tuneful, contrapuntal, infectious, and, harmonically, colorful, than, any, others, of, his, era, some, speculate, that, joplin, s, achievements, were, influenced, by, his, classically, trained, german, music, teacher, julius, weiss, who, may, have, brought, a, polka, rhythmic, sensibility, from, the, old, country, to, the, 11, year, old, joplin, as, curtis, put, it, the, educated, german, could, open, up, the, door, to, a, world, of, learning, and, music, of, which, young, joplin, was, largely, unaware, joplin, s, first, and, most, significant, hit, the, maple, leaf, rag, was, described, as, the, archetype, of, the, classic, rag, and, influenced, subsequent, rag, composers, for, at, least, 12, years, after, its, initial, publication, thanks, to, its, rhythmic, patterns, melody, lines, and, harmony, though, with, the, exception, of, joseph, lamb, and, james, scott, they, generally, failed, to, enlarge, upon, it, joplin, used, the, maple, leaf, rag, as, inspiration, for, subsequent, works, such, as, the, cascades, in, 1903, leola, in, 1905, gladiolus, rag, in, 1907, and, sugar, cane, rag, in, 1908, while, he, used, similar, harmonic, and, melodic, patterns, the, later, compositions, were, not, simple, copies, but, were, distinctly, new, works, which, used, dissonance, chromatic, sections, and, the, blues, third, the, opera, s, setting, is, a, former, slave, community, in, an, isolated, forest, near, joplin, s, childhood, town, texarkana, in, september, 1884, the, plot, centers, on, an, 18, year, old, woman, treemonisha, who, is, taught, to, read, by, a, white, woman, and, then, leads, her, community, against, the, influence, of, conjurers, who, prey, on, ignorance, and, superstition, treemonisha, is, abducted, and, is, about, to, be, thrown, into, a, wasps, nest, when, her, friend, remus, rescues, her, the, community, realizes, the, value, of, education, and, the, liability, of, their, ignorance, before, choosing, her, as, their, teacher, and, leader, joplin, wrote, both, the, score, and, the, libretto, for, the, opera, which, largely, follows, the, form, of, european, opera, with, many, conventional, arias, ensembles, and, choruses, in, addition, the, themes, of, superstition, and, mysticism, evident, in, treemonisha, are, common, in, the, operatic, tradition, and, certain, aspects, of, the, plot, echo, devices, in, the, work, of, the, german, composer, richard, wagner, of, which, joplin, was, aware, a, sacred, tree, that, treemonisha, sits, beneath, recalls, the, tree, that, siegmund, takes, his, enchanted, sword, from, in, die, walk, re, and, the, retelling, of, the, heroine, s, origins, echos, aspects, of, the, opera, siegfried, in, addition, african, american, folk, tales, also, influence, the, story, the, wasp, nest, incident, is, similar, to, the, story, of, br, er, rabbit, and, the, briar, patch, treemonisha, is, not, a, ragtime, opera, because, joplin, employed, the, styles, of, ragtime, and, other, black, music, sparingly, using, them, to, convey, racial, character, and, to, celebrate, the, music, of, his, childhood, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, opera, has, been, seen, as, a, valuable, record, of, rural, black, music, from, late, 19th, century, re, created, by, a, skilled, and, sensitive, participant, berlin, speculates, about, parallels, between, the, plot, and, joplin, s, own, life, he, notes, that, lottie, joplin, the, composer, s, third, wife, saw, a, connection, between, the, character, treemonisha, s, wish, to, lead, her, people, out, of, ignorance, and, a, similar, desire, in, the, composer, in, addition, it, has, been, speculated, that, treemonisha, represents, freddie, joplin, s, second, wife, because, the, date, of, the, opera, s, setting, was, likely, to, have, been, the, month, of, her, birth, at, the, time, of, the, opera, s, publication, in, 1911, the, american, musician, and, art, journal, praised, it, as, an, entirely, new, form, of, operatic, art, later, critics, have, also, praised, the, opera, as, occupying, a, special, place, in, american, history, with, its, heroine, a, startlingly, early, voice, for, modern, civil, rights, causes, notably, the, importance, of, education, and, knowledge, to, african, american, advancement, curtis, s, conclusion, is, similar, in, the, end, treemonisha, offered, a, celebration, of, literacy, learning, hard, work, and, community, solidarity, as, the, best, formula, for, advancing, the, race, berlin, describes, it, as, a, fine, opera, certainly, more, interesting, than, most, operas, then, being, written, in, the, united, states, but, later, states, that, joplin, s, own, libretto, showed, the, composer, was, not, a, competent, dramatist, with, the, book, not, up, to, the, quality, of, the, music, as, rick, benjamin, the, founder, and, director, of, the, paragon, ragtime, orchestra, found, out, joplin, succeeded, in, performing, treemonisha, for, paying, audiences, in, bayonne, new, jersey, in, 1913, joplin, s, skills, as, a, pianist, were, described, in, glowing, terms, by, a, sedalia, newspaper, in, 1898, and, fellow, ragtime, composers, arthur, marshall, and, joe, jordan, both, said, that, he, played, the, instrument, well, however, the, son, of, publisher, john, stark, stated, that, joplin, was, a, rather, mediocre, pianist, and, that, he, composed, on, paper, rather, than, at, the, piano, artie, matthews, recalled, the, delight, the, st, louis, players, took, in, outplaying, joplin, while, joplin, never, made, an, audio, recording, his, playing, is, preserved, on, seven, piano, rolls, for, use, in, mechanical, player, pianos, all, seven, were, made, in, 1916, of, these, the, six, released, under, the, connorized, label, show, evidence, of, editing, to, correct, the, performance, to, strict, rhythm, and, add, embellishments, probably, by, the, staff, musicians, at, connorized, berlin, theorizes, that, by, the, time, joplin, reached, st, louis, he, may, have, experienced, discoordination, of, the, fingers, tremors, and, an, inability, to, speak, clearly, all, symptoms, of, the, syphilis, that, killed, him, in, 1917, biographer, blesh, described, the, second, roll, recording, of, maple, leaf, rag, on, the, unirecord, label, from, june, 1916, as, shocking, disorganized, and, completely, distressing, to, hear, while, there, is, disagreement, among, piano, roll, experts, as, to, how, much, of, this, is, due, to, the, relatively, primitive, recording, and, production, techniques, of, the, time, berlin, notes, that, the, maple, leaf, rag, roll, was, likely, to, be, the, truest, record, of, joplin, s, playing, at, the, time, the, roll, however, may, not, reflect, his, abilities, earlier, in, life, joplin, and, his, fellow, ragtime, composers, rejuvenated, american, popular, music, fostering, an, appreciation, for, african, american, music, among, european, americans, by, creating, exhilarating, and, liberating, dance, tunes, its, syncopation, and, rhythmic, drive, gave, it, a, vitality, and, freshness, attractive, to, young, urban, audiences, indifferent, to, victorian, proprieties, joplin, s, ragtime, expressed, the, intensity, and, energy, of, a, modern, urban, america, joshua, rifkin, a, leading, joplin, recording, artist, wrote, a, pervasive, sense, of, lyricism, infuses, his, work, and, even, at, his, most, high, spirited, he, cannot, repress, a, hint, of, melancholy, or, adversity, he, had, little, in, common, with, the, fast, and, flashy, school, of, ragtime, that, grew, up, after, him, joplin, historian, bill, ryerson, adds, that, in, the, hands, of, authentic, practitioners, like, joplin, ragtime, was, a, disciplined, form, capable, of, astonishing, variety, and, subtlety, joplin, did, for, the, rag, what, chopin, did, for, the, mazurka, his, style, ranged, from, tones, of, torment, to, stunning, serenades, that, incorporated, the, bolero, and, the, tango, biographer, susan, curtis, wrote, that, joplin, s, music, had, helped, to, revolutionise, american, music, and, culture, by, removing, victorian, restraint, composer, and, actor, max, morath, found, it, striking, that, the, vast, majority, of, joplin, s, work, did, not, enjoy, the, popularity, of, the, maple, leaf, rag, because, while, the, compositions, were, of, increasing, lyrical, beauty, and, delicate, syncopation, they, remained, obscure, and, unheralded, during, his, life, according, to, music, historian, ian, whitcomb, joplin, apparently, realized, that, his, music, was, ahead, of, its, time, opined, that, maple, leaf, rag, would, make, him, king, of, ragtime, composers, but, he, also, knew, that, he, would, not, be, a, pop, hero, in, his, own, lifetime, when, i, m, dead, twenty, five, years, people, are, going, to, recognize, me, he, told, a, friend, just, over, thirty, years, later, he, was, recognized, and, later, historian, rudi, blesh, wrote, a, large, book, about, ragtime, which, he, dedicated, to, the, memory, of, joplin, although, he, was, penniless, and, disappointed, at, the, end, of, his, life, joplin, set, the, standard, for, ragtime, compositions, and, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, ragtime, music, while, ragtime, s, popularity, faded, around, then, new, orleans, jazz, stride, and, novelty, piano, subsequently, adopted, many, of, its, traits, and, as, a, pioneer, composer, and, performer, he, helped, pave, the, way, for, young, black, artists, to, reach, american, audiences, of, all, races, after, his, death, jazz, historian, floyd, levin, noted, those, few, who, realized, his, greatness, bowed, their, heads, in, sorrow, this, was, the, passing, of, the, king, of, all, ragtime, writers, the, man, who, gave, america, a, genuine, native, music, recordings, of, joplin,
