the, assistance, of, an, american, ghost, writer, bhutto, biographer, brooke, allen, stating, that, it, was, pre, eminently, a, political, performance, written, for, a, western, audience, with, the, intent, of, seducing, western, opinion, and, opinion, makers, as, well, as, whitewashing, her, father, s, regime, bhutto, s, autobiography, contained, several, factual, falsifications, she, wished, to, present, herself, as, a, ground, breaker, when, it, came, to, gender, issues, and, thus, presented, her, mother, nusrat, as, being, far, more, conservative, than, she, really, was, for, instance, falsely, claiming, that, nusrat, had, urged, her, to, wear, the, burqa, when, she, had, reached, adolescence, bhutto, s, first, cabinet, was, the, largest, in, pakistan, s, history, she, appointed,

with, initiatives, to, encourage, the, development, of, civil, society, she, ensured, the, release, of, a, number, of, political, prisoners, detained, under, the, zia, government, and, lifted, the,

to, pay, government, wages, many, of, the, policy, promises, she, had, made, in, her, election, campaign, were, not, delivered, because, the, pakistani, state, was, unable, to, finance, them, she, had, claimed, that, a, million, new, homes, would, be, built, each, year, and, that, universal, free, education, and, healthcare, would, be, introduced, none, of, which, was, economically, feasible, for, her, government, to, deliver, the, country, also, faced, a, growing, problem, with, the, illegal, narcotics, trade, with, pakistan, being, among, the, world, s, largest, heroin, exporters, and, the, drug, s, use, rapidly, increasing, domestically, bhutto, pledged, that, she, would, take, tough, action, on, the, powerful, drug, barons, bhutto, often, argued, with, beg, gul, and, khan, over, her, desired, policies, and, according, to, allen, won, some, battles, but, ultimately, lost, the, war, against, them, bhutto, succeeded, in, getting, khan, s, approval, to, change, two, of, the,

had, the, backing, of, the, military, in, the, presidential, election, bhutto, initially, proposed, malik, qasim, who, had, been, involved, in, the, mrd, as, the, ppp, s, nominee, but, the, military,

sindhi, minority, as, well, as, a, perception, that, bhutto, a, sindhi, was, attacking, the, punjab, although, bhutto, had, long, supported, greater, autonomy, for, pakistan, s, provinces, she, opposed, it, in, the, case, of, the, punjab, sharif, s, punjabi, authority, refused, to, accept, the, federal, officials, whom, bhutto, posted, there, relations, between, bhutto, and, pakistan, s, civil, service, also, deteriorated, causing, paralysis, of, many, state, affairs, bhutto, spoke, of, it, as, zia, s, bureaucracy, and, her, perceived, anti, punjabi, stance, impacted, many, civil,

laden, who, sought, to, overthrow, her, government, and, replace, it, with, an, islamic, theocracy, her, conservative, critics, continued, to, claim, it, was, un, islamic, for, a, woman, to, govern, and, unsuccessfully, tried, to, have, pakistan, suspended, from, the, international, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, on, this, basis, during, her, first, premiership, bhutto, went, on, a, number, of, foreign, trips, enhancing, her, image, as, the, first, female, prime, minister, in, the, islamic, world, in, these, she, sought, to, attract, foreign, investment, and, aid, for, pakistan, she, also, made, efforts, to, cultivate, good, relationships, with, the, leaders, of, islamic, countries, who, also, had, good, relationships, with, her, father, including, libya, s, gaddafi, abu,

against, the, country, s, marxist, leninist, government, the, u, s, was, funneling, money, to, these, mujahedeen, through, pakistan, although, preferred, to, deal, directly, with, beg, gul, and,

from, which, the, country, s, anti, soviet, islamist, dominated, opposition, forces, could, operate, when, the, operation, failed, and, the, pakistanis, were, driven, out, by, the, afghan, army, gul, blamed, bhutto, s, administration, for, the, failure, claiming, that, someone, in, her, entourage, had, leaked, details, of, the, mission, to, the, afghan, government, gul, was, too, powerful, for, bhutto, to, force, him, into, retirement, but, in, may, 1989, she, transferred, him, from, the, isi, to, another, section, of, the, military, placing, a, more, trusted, military, figure, in, his, role, bhutto, initially, attempted, to, improve, relations, with, neighbouring, india, withdrawing, zia, s, offer, of, a, no, war, pact, and, announcing, the, 1972, simla, agreement, as, the, basis, of, future, relations, she, invited, indian, prime, minister, rajiv, gandhi, and, his, wife, sonia, as, her, guests, for, a, three, day, visit, in, islamabad, following, the, south, asian,

of, the, punjab, this, warming, of, relations, angered, many, domestic, islamist, and, conservative, forces, they, alleged, that, she, and, gandhi, were, having, a, sexual, relationship, said, that, she, was, secretly, an, indian, agent, and, also, placed, renewed, emphasis, on, the, fact, that, bhutto, s, paternal, grandmother, had, been, born, to, a, hindu, family, the, people, of, kashmir, do, not, fear, death, because, they, are, muslims, the, kashmiris, have, the, blood, of, the, mujahids, and, ghazis, the, kashmiris, have, the, blood, of, muhajadeens, because, kashmiris, are, the, heirs, of, prophet, mohammed, hazrat, ali, and, hazrat, omar, and, the, brave, women, of, kashmir, they, know, how, to, fight, and, also, to, live, and, when, they, live, they, do, so, with, dignity, from,

particularly, on, the, kashmir, conflict, amid, growing, kashmiri, protests, against, indian, rule, in, interviews, bhutto, expressed, support, for, the, kashmiri, muslim, community, she, called, on, the, united, nations, to, oversee, the, kashmir, plebiscite, originally, promised, in, 1948, bhutto, visited, a, training, camp, for, pro, independence, kashmiris, on, the, pakistani, side, of, the, border, and, pledged, 5, million, for, their, cause, she, followed, this, with, further, statements, in, support, of, the, pro, independence, groups, in, one, speech, she, incited, kashmiri, muslims, to, rise, up, against, their, administration, later, in, a, 1993, interview, bhutto, stated, that, supporting, proxy, wars, in, punjab, and, kashmir, was, the, one, right, thing, undertaken, by, zia, presenting, these, in, part, as, revenge, for, india, s, role, in, the, humiliating, loss, of, bangladesh, in, 1990, major, general, pervez, musharraf, proposed, a, military, invasion, of, kargil, as, part, of, an, attempt, to, annex, kashmir, bhutto, refused, to, back, the, plan, believing, that, the, international, condemnation, would, be, severe, with, both, armies, mobilizing, on, either, side, of, the, border, there, were, growing, fears, that, tensions, over, kashmir, could, result, in, a, nuclear, war, between, pakistan, and, india, the, u, s, sent, special, envoy, robert, gates, to, the, region, to, dissuade, the, pakistanis, from, going, to, war, he, could, not, meet, bhutto, who, was, in, yemen, as, part, of, a, tour, of, the, gulf, states, but, met, with, president, khan, informing, him, that, the, u, s, would, not, support, pakistani, military, action, he, convinced, pakistan, to, step, back, from, hostilities, and, to, disband, the, kashmiri, training, camps, in, its, territory, after, bhutto, became, prime, minister, president, khan, and, the, military, were, reluctant, to, tell, her, about, pakistan, s, nuclear, program, and, it, remains, unknown, how, much, bhutto, knew, about, the, issue, during, her, first, term, in, office, she, later, related, that, to, find, out, more, she, contacted, key, scientists, in, the, program, such, as, a, q, khan, herself, bypassing, the, president, and, military, hierarchy, on, her, trip, to, the, united, states, she, told, congress, that, we, do, not, possess, nor, do, we, intend, to, make, a, nuclear, device, while, in, washington, d, c, she, met, with, cia, director, william, webster, who, showed, her, a, mock, up, of, the, pakistani, nuclear, weapon, and, stated, his, opinion, that, research, the, project, it, had, reached, a, crescendo, in, the, final, years, of, zia, s, government, william, s, revelations, came, as, a, shock, to, bhutto, who, was, unaware, of, how, advanced, pakistan, s, nuclear, development, had, become, the, united, states, wanted, to, prevent, pakistan, from, creating, such, a, device, and, president, george, h, w, bush, informed, her, that, u, s, military, aid, to, the, country, would, cease, unless, pakistan, refrained, from, producing, nuclear, bomb, cores, the, final, step, in, creating, the, weapon, between, january, and, march, 1989, she, authorised, cold, tests, of, nuclear, weaponry, without, fissionable, material, although, this, did, not, satisfy, the, military, authorities, in, 1990, shortly, before, leaving, office, the, american, ambassador, robert, oakley, informed, her, that, information, obtained, by, u, s, satellites, indicated, that, her, commitment, to, not, produce, weapons, grade, uranium, had, been, breached, at, the, kahuta,

while, the, investigations, into, his, corruption, were, therefore, politically, motivated, there, also, was, significant, evidence, of, his, guilt, in, this, regard, in, 1990, bhutto, gave, birth, to, her, first, daughter, bakhtawar, tales, of, corruption, in, public, sector, industries, began, to, surface, which, undermined, the, credibility, of, bhutto, the, unemployment, and, labour, strikes, began, to, take, place, which, halted, and, jammed, the, economic, wheel, of, the, country, and, bhutto, was, unable, to, solve, these, issues, due, to, the, cold, war, with, the, president, in, august, 1990, khan, dismissed, bhutto, s, government, under, the, eighth, amendment, of, the, constitution, he, claimed, that, this, was, necessary, owing, to, her, government, s, corruption, and,

lack, of, healthcare, although, not, also, discussing, her, own, administration, s, failures, on, those, same, issues, to, journalists, she, remained, unrepentant, about, her, period, in, office, insisting, that, she, had, made, no, mistakes, she, subsequently, also, accused, sharif, of, backing, the, salafi, jihadist, militant, group, al, qaeda, established, by, bin, laden, following, the,

discontent, over, pakistan, s, economic, situation, the, announcement, of, the, 1995, budget, was, met, with, strikes, and, demonstrations, as, many, ppp, members, became, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, bhutto, during, the, 1990s, they, referred, to, her, brother, mir, murtaza, still, in, exile, as, zulfikar, s, true, heir, from, syria, murtaza, campaigned, as, an, independent, candidate, for, larkana, in, the, sindh, legislative, assembly, election, of, 1993, bhutto, did, not, want, him, to, join, the, ppp, fearing, him, as, a, potential, challenger, to, her, leadership, of, the, party, however, his, mother, nusrat, campaigned, for, him, helping, him, win, the, election, having, won, he, flew, back, to, pakistan, in, november, to, take, up, his, new, position, around, ninety, criminal, charges, had, been, brought, against, him, under, zia, s, regime, so, on, arrival, murtaza, was, arrested, and, held, for, eight, months, in, solitary, confinement, suvorova, suggested, that, bhutto, had, allowed, this, as, a, concession, to, those, including, president, leghari, and, the, sindhi, chief, minister, syed, abdullah, ali, shah, who, insisted, that, murtaza, face, criminal, proceedings, for, his, militant, activities, murtaza, maintained, that, it, was, he, rather, than, his, sister, who, was, the, standard, bearer, for, their, father, s, championing, of, the, downtrodden, he, espoused, a, socialist, platform, different, from, his, sister, s, and, called, for, internal, elections, within, the, ppp, which, could, have, resulted, in, the, removal, of, bhutto, animosity, grew, between, the, two, siblings, in, june, 1994, murtaza, was, released, on, bail, and, at, his, subsequent, trial, he, was, acquitted, of, all, charges, in, 1995, he, established, his, own, party, the, ppp, shaheed, bhutto, the, party, s, name, implied, that, he, was, closer, to, the, bhutto, s, family, s, shaheed, than, his, sister, whom, he, symbolically, distanced, from, the, family, by, referring, to, her, as, begum, zardari, murtaza, focused, much, of, his, criticism, on, bhutto, s, husband, zardari, whom, he, blamed, of, being, responsible, for, government, corruption, he, hung, a, picture, of, zardari, up, in, the, guest, toilet, of, his, house, as, an, act, of, disrespect, to, his, brother, in, law, a, rumour, spread, that, in, one, incident, murtaza, invited, zardari, to, his, house, only, to, have, him, pinned, down, by, bodyguards, and, half, his, mustache, forcibly, shaved, off, nusrat, continued, to, support, murtaza, damaging, her, relationship, with, bhutto, mother, and, daughter, increasingly, criticised, one, another, bhutto, was, so, angry, with, her, mother, s, actions, that, she, ousted, her, as, co, chair, of, the, ppp, this, angered, nusrat, who, told, the, new, york, times, she, s, talked, a, lot, about, democracy, but, she, s, become, a, little, dictator, on, 20, september, 1996, murtaza, was, ambushed, by, police, near, karachi, they, opened, fire, killing, him, and, seven, others, all, witnesses, were, taken, into, police, custody, where, two, of, them, died, it, was, widely, believed, in, pakistan, that, the, killing, had, been, ordered, by, a, senior, government, figure, murtaza, s, supporters, thought, that, bhutto, and, her, husband, were, responsible, when, bhutto, tried, to, attend, her, brother, s, funeral, in, larkana, local, murtaza, supporters, pelted, her, car, with, rocks, at, the, funeral, nusrat, who, had, the, early, stages, of, alzheimer, s, disease, also, blamed, bhutto, for, her, brother, s, death, bhutto, initially, blamed, the, killing, on, a, conspiracy, against, her, family, she, suggested, that, president, leghari, had, been, involved, in, an, act, designed, to, destabilise, her, government, she, brought, in, scotland, yard, to, investigate, partly, to, quell, rumors, that, she, had, ordered, the, killing, although, the, case, remained, unsolved, after, murtaza, s, death, bhutto, re, established, a, relationship, with, her, mother, her, approval, poll, rose, by, 38, after, she, appeared, and, said, in, a, private, television, interview, after, the, elections, we, are, unhappy, with, the, manner, in, which, tampered, electoral, lists, were, provided, in, a, majority, of, constituencies, our, voters, were, turned, away, the, conservatives, attracted, voters, from, religious, society, mma, whose, support, had, collapsed, in, confidential, official, documents, benazir, bhutto, had, objected, to, the, number, of, urdu, speaking, class, in, 1993, elections, in, the, context, that, she, had, no, urdu, speaking, sentiment, in, her, circle, and, discrimination, was, continued, even, in, her, government, her, stance, on, these, issues, was, perceived, as, part, of, rising, public, disclosure, which, altaf, hussain, called, racism, due, to, benazir, bhutto, s, stubbornness, and, authoritative, actions, her, political, rivals, gave, her, the, nickname, iron, lady, of, pakistan, no, response, was, issued, by, bhutto, but, she, soon, associated, with, the, term, benazir, bhutto, expanded, the, authoritative, rights, of, police, combatant, force, and, the, provisional, governments, that, tackled, the, local, opposition, aggressively, bhutto, through, her, internal, security, minister, naseerullah, babar, intensified, the, internal, security, operations, and, steps, gradually, putting, down, the, opposition, s, political, rallies, while, she, did, not, completely, abandon, the, reconciliation, policy, in, her, own, worlds, benazir, bhutto, announced, there, was, no, basis, for, in, view, of, the, ongoing, political, process, bhutto, was, an, economist, by, profession, therefore, during, her, terms, as, prime, minister, she, herself, took, charge, of, the, ministry, of, finance, bhutto, sought, to, improve, the, country, s, declining, economy, she, disagreed, with, her, father, s, nationalisation, and, socialist, economics, soon, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, benazir, attempted, to, privatise, major, industries, that, had, been, nationalised, in, the, 1970s, bhutto, promised, to, end, the, nationalisation, programme, and, to, carry, out, the, industrialisation, programme, by, means, other, than, state, intervention, however, bhutto, did, not, carry, out, the, denationalisation, program, or, liberalisation, of, the, economy, during, her, first, government, no, nationalised, units, were, privatised, and, few, economic, regulations, were, reviewed, pakistan, suffered, a, currency, crisis, when, the, government, failed, to, arrest, the, 30, fall, in, the, value, of, the, pakistani, rupee, from, 21, to, 30, per, u, s, dollar, soon, economic, progress, became, her, top, priority, but, her, investment, and, industrialisation, programs, faced, major, setbacks, due, to, conceptions, formed, by, investors, based, upon, her, people, s, party, nationalisation, program, in, the, 1970s, by, the, 1990s, khan, and, bhutto, s, government, had, also, ultimately, lost, the, currency, war, with, the, indian, rupee, which, beat, the, value, of, pakistan, rupee, for, the, first, time, in, the, 1970s, bhutto, s, denationalisation, program, also, suffered, from, many, political, setbacks, as, many, of, her, government, members, were, either, directly, or, indirectly, involved, with, the, government, corruption, in, major, government, owned, industries, and, her, appointed, government, members, allegedly, sabotaged, her, efforts, to, privatise, the, industries, overall, the, living, standard, for, people, in, pakistan, declined, as, inflation, and, unemployment, grew, at, an, exponential, rate, particularly, as, un, sanctions, began, to, take, effect, during, her, first, and, second, term, the, difference, between, rich, and, poor, visibly, increased, and, the, middle, class, in, particular, were, the, ones, who, bore, the, brunt, of, the, economic, inequality, according, to, a, calculation, completed, by, the, federal, bureau, of, statistics, the, standard, of, living, for, the, rich, improved, while, the, standard, of, living, for, the, poor, declined, benazir, attributed, this, economic, inequality, to, be, a, result, of, ongoing, and, continuous, illegal, bangladeshi, immigration, bhutto, ordered, a, crackdown, on, and, deportation, of, illegal, bangladeshi, immigrants, her, action, strained, and, created, tensions, in, bangladesh, pakistan, relations, as, bangladesh, prime, minister, khaleda, zia, refused, to, accept, the, deportees, and, reportedly, sent, two, planeloads, back, to, pakistan, religious, parties, also, criticised, bhutto, and, dubbed, the, crackdown, as, anti, islamic, this, operation, backfired, and, had, devastating, effects, on, pakistan, s, economy, president, khan, saw, this, as, a, major, economic, failure, despite, khan, s, permission, granted, to, bhutto, for, the, approval, of, her, economic, policies, khan, blamed, bhutto, for, this, extensive, economic, slowdown, and, her, policy, that, failed, to, stop, the, illegal, immigration, khan, attributed, bhutto, s, government, members, corruption, in, government, owned, industries, as, the, major, sinkhole, in, pakistan, s, economy, that, failed, to, compete, with, neighboring, india, s, economy, during, her, second, term, bhutto, continued, to, follow, former, prime, minister, nawaz, sharif, s, privatisation, policies, which, she, called, a, disciplined, macroeconomics, policy, after, the, 1993, general, elections, the, privatisation, programme, of, state, owned, banks, and, utilities, accelerated, more, than, 42, billion, was, raised, from, the, sale, of, nationalised, corporations, and, industries, and, another, us, 20, billion, from, the, foreign, investment, made, the, united, states, after, 1993, the, country, s, national, economy, again, entered, in, the, second, period, of, the, stagflation, and, more, roughly, began, bite, the, country, s, financial, resources, and, the, financial, capital, bhutto, s, second, government, found, it, extremely, difficult, to, counter, the, second, era, of, stagflation, with, pressler, amendment, and, the, us, financial, and, military, embargo, tightened, its, position, after, a, year, of, study, bhutto, implemented, and, enforced, the, eighth, plan, to, overcome, the, stagflation, by, creating, a, dependable, and, effective, mechanism, for, accelerating, economic, and, social, progress, but, according, to, american, ambassador, to, pakistan, william, milam, s, bibliography, bangladesh, and, pakistan, flirting, with, failure, in, south, asia, the, eighth, plan, which, reflected, the, planned, economy, of, the, soviet, union, was, doomed, to, meet, with, failure, from, the, very, beginning, of, 1994, as, the, policies, were, weak, and, incoherent, on, many, occasions, bhutto, resisted, to, privatise, globally, competitive, and, billion, dollar, worth, state, owned, enterprises, such, as, pakistan, railways, and, pakistan, steel, mills, instead, the, grip, of, nationalisation, in, those, state, owned, enterprises, was, tightened, in, order, to, secure, the, capital, investment, of, these, industries, the, process, of, privatisation, of, the, nationalised, industries, was, associated, with, the, marked, performance, and, improvement, especially, the, terms, of, labour, productivity, a, number, of, privatisation, of, industries, such, as, gas, water, supply, and, sanitation, and, electricity, general, were, natural, monopolies, for, which, the, privatisation, involved, little, competition, furthermore, benazir, denied, that, privatisation, of, the, pakistan, railways, would, take, place, despite, the, calls, made, in, pakistan, and, was, said, to, have, told, planning, commission, chief, naveed, qamar, railways, privatisation, will, be, the, black, hole, of, this, government, please, never, mention, the, railways, to, me, again, bhutto, always, resisted, privatisation, of, united, bank, limited, pakistan, ubl, but, its, management, sent, the, recommendation, for, the, privatisation, which, dismayed, the, labour, union, the, united, group, of, employees, management, asked, bhutto, for, the, issue, of, the, regulation, sheet, which, she, denied, the, holding, of, ubl, in, government, control, turned, out, to, be, a, move, that, ended, in, disaster, for, bhutto, s, government, major, general, pervez, musharraf, worked, closely, with, bhutto, and, her, government, in, formulating, an, israel, strategy, in, 1993, bhutto, ordered, musharraf, then, director, general, of, the, pakistani, army, s, directorate, general, for, the, military, operation, dgmo, to, join, her,

the, pressler, amendment, and, launch, a, campaign, against, extremism, she, criticised, us, nonproliferation, policy, and, demanded, that, the, united, states, honor, its, contractual, obligation, during, her, second, term, relations, with, indian, prime, minister, p, v, narasimha, rao, further, deteriorated, like, her, father, benazir, bhutto, used, rhetoric, to, oppose, india, and, campaign, in, the, international, community, against, the, indian, nuclear, program, on, 1, may, 1995, she, used, harsh, language, in, her, public, warning, to, india, that, continuation, of, nuclear, program, would, have, terrible, consequences, india, responded, to, this, saying, she, was, interfering, in, an, internal, matter, of, india, and, the, indian, army, fired, a, rpg, at, the, kahuta, which, further, escalated, events, leading, to, full, fledged, war, when, this, news, reached, bhutto, she, responded, by, high, alerting, the, air, force, strategic, command, it, ordered, heavily, armed, arrows, griffins, black, panthers, and, the, black, spiders, to, begin, air, sorties, and, to, patrol, the, indo, pakistan, border, on, day, and, night, regular, missions, all, of, these, squadrons, are, part, of, the, strategic, command, on, 30, may, india, test, fired, a, prithvi, 1, missile, near, the, pakistan, border, which, bhutto, condemned, she, responded, by, deploying, shaheen, i, missiles, however, they, were, not, armed, benazir, bhutto, permitted, the, paf, to, deploy, the, crotale, missile, defence, and, the, anza, mk, iii, near, the, indian, border, which, escalated, the, conflict, but, effectively, kept, the, indian, army, and, the, indian, air, force, from, launching, any, surprise, attack, in, 1995, the, isi, reported, to, bhutto, that, narasimha, rao, had,

problem, facing, her, country, as, the, clash, between, moderation, and, extremism, and, was, pessimistic, about, her, safety, musharraf, himself, had, survived, several, assassination, attempts, by, islamist, militants, and, warned, bhutto, that, she, too, would, be, a, target, she, requested, that, the, us, or, uk, take, responsibility, for, her, security, but, they, refused, and, her, security,

bureau, of, investigation, to, investigate, the, crime, but, he, refused, relations, between, the, pair, were, further, strained, when, musharraf, declared, a, state, of, emergency, and, suspended, the, constitution, in, november, at, which, point, bhutto, was, visiting, dubai, the, ppp, and, pml, n, launched, protests, at, musharraf, s, actions, against, the, warnings, of, some, of, her,

while, ppp, supporters, rioted, in, various, parts, of, pakistan, leading, to, at, least, 50, deaths, authorities, claimed, that, the, assassin, had, been, a, teenage, boy, from, south, waziristan, they, claimed, to, have, proof, that, the, attack, had, been, masterminded, by, baitullah, mehsud, leader, of, the, pakistani, taliban, the, united, states, central, intelligence, agency, concurred, that, this, was, probable, although, mehsud, denied, the, accusation, mehsud, nevertheless, had, a, motive, he, believed, that, bhutto, s, pro, american, and, secularist, agenda, would, undermine, the, pakistani, taliban, s, control, of, south, waziristan, and, hinder, the, growth, of, sunni, islamist, radicalism, al, qaeda, commander, mustafa, abu, al, yazid, claimed, responsibility, for, the, assassination, declaring, that, we, terminated, the, most, precious, american, asset, which, vowed, to, defeat, mujahideen, the, ppp, accused, the, government, of, a, cover, up, with, several, ppp, figures, claiming, that, bhutto, had, been, killed, by, a, sniper, linked, to, the, intelligence, agencies, within, pakistan, there, was, also, public, speculation, that, the, attack, might, have, been, masterminded, by, india, or, the, united, states, musharraf, agreed, to, invite, britain, s, scotland, yard, to, investigate, the, assassination, although, its, eventual, report, proved, inconclusive, requests, for, the, body, to, be, exhumed, for, an, autopsy, were, rejected, by, zardari, in, bhutto, s, political, will, she, had, designated, her, son, bilawal, who, was, then, 19, as, her, political, heir, as, chair, of, the, ppp, it, also, specified, that, her, husband, should, serve, as, custodial, chairman, until, bilawal, completed, his, formal, education, zardari, became, co, chair, of, the, ppp, the, academic, anna, suvorova, specified, that, bhutto, s, assassination, created, a, real, family, cult, one, which, was, fuelled, by, various, apocrypha, rituals, and, relics, in, the, wake, of, bhutto, s, death, the, election, was, postponed, from, january, to, february, 2008, when, it, resulted, in, the, formation, of, a, coalition, government, bringing, together, the, ppp, and, the, pakistan, muslim, league, nawaz, the, new, coalition, put, forth, ppp, member, yousuf, raza, gilani, as, prime, minister, musharraf, facing, likely, impeachment, resigned, as, president, in, august, he, fled, to, london, although, in, february, 2011, a, rawalpindi, court, issued, a, subpoena, for, him, on, the, grounds, that, he, had, not, acted, on, known, threats, to, bhutto, and, had, provided, insufficient, security, to, protect, her, in, september, 2008, zardari, was, elected, president, of, pakistan, by, the, country, s, electoral, college, he, remained, in, that, position, until, 2013, as, president, zardari, called, for, a, united, nations, investigation, into, his, wife, s, assassination, in, 2009, the, un, secretary, general, ban, ki, moon, established, a, three, person, team, to, lead, the, investigation, comprising, the, chilean, heraldo, mu, oz, irish, peter, fitzgerald, and, indonesian, marzuki, darusman, although, it, was, not, in, the, commission, s, remit, to, identify, a, culprit, mu, oz, later, expressed, the, view, that, the, assassination, was, likely, carried, out, by, the, pakistani, taliban, perhaps, with, the, support, of, mehsud, and, that, they, may, well, have, been, assisted, by, rogue, elements, in, the, country, s, intelligence, agencies, he, also, expressed, the, view, that, the, original, police, investigation, had, been, deliberately, botched, in, february, 2012, the, pakistani, official, enquiry, issued, its, final, report, placing, responsibility, for, the, attack, with, 27, different, militant, groups, in, may, 2013, the, state, s, main, prosecutor, in, the, bhutto, case, zulfikar, ali, was, himself, assassinated, in, islamabad, there, was, never, a, smoking, gun, in, the, bhutto, investigation, many, in, pakistan, had, reasons, for, wanting, bhutto, dead, some, saw, her, as, corrupt, and, her, killing, was, considered, advantageous, to, both, the, military, establishment, and, to, the, islamic, fundamentalists, who, despised, her, bhutto, was, committed, to, democracy, and, modernisation, and, believed, that, the, future, of, the, islamic, world, lay, in, the, embrace, of, these, processes, however, allen, thought, that, it, was, hard, to, pin, down, what, bhutto, s, core, political, values, actually, were, bhatia, described, bhutto, as, having, liberal, convictions, and, a, self, evidently, progressive, outlook, while, suvorova, thought, that, bhutto, presented, herself, as, the, outpost, of, universal, liberal, values, in, conservative, pakistan, for, a, western, audience, bhutto, biographer, g, s, bhargava, thought, that, in, the, context, of, pakistani, politics, she, could, pass, for, a, social, democrat, her, friend, catherine, drucker, who, knew, her, while, the, two, women, were, at, oxford, university, said, bhutto, s, political, views, were, then, akin, to, those, commonplace, within, the, mild, leftism, of, the, day, bhargava, added, that, through, her, education, in, governance, and, politics, at, harvard, and, then, oxford, bhutto, had, a, thorough, exposure, to, political, theory, and, practice, in, historical, perspective, as, well, as, in, the, contemporary, setting, bhutto, admired, the, thatcherite, economic, policies, pursued, by, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, in, the, united, kingdom, she, was, according, to, biographer, mushtaq, ahmed, a, zealous, convert, to, privatisation, and, market, economics, bhutto, advocated, the, creation, of, an, expanded, economically, and, politically, stable, middle, class, in, pakistan, believing, that, this, was, needed, in, order, to, sustain, a, stable, democratic, state, allen, commented, that, although, the, ppp, had, once, been, officially, socialist, in, ideology, bhutto, was, not, a, natural, socialist, or, even, as, adept, at, talking, the, talk, as, zulfikar, had, been, she, disagreed, with, her, father, s, socialist, economic, policies, and, when, in, power, sought, to, privatise, various, industries, that, had, been, nationalised, in, the, 1970s, ahmed, thus, suggested, that, while, under, bhutto, the, ppp, continued, to, profess, ideals, of, egalitarianism, and, claimed, it, would, enhance, the, welfare, of, peasants, and, workers, such, progressive, phraseology, couched, an, absence, of, economic, policies, to, benefit, the, poor, instead, ahmed, thought, its, policies, primarily, benefited, the, privileged, classes, and, was, thus, a, right, wing, rather, than, left, wing, party, during, her, years, in, office, bhutto, also, did, nothing, to, seriously, challenge, the, feudal, nature, of, rural, pakistan, under, bhutto, ahmed, wrote, people, from, the, wealthy, feudal, class, dominated, the, ppp, both, at, the, federal, and, provincial, levels, bhargava, suggested, that, because, of, the, period, in, which, she, was, operating, bhutto, did, not, need, to, engage, in, the, verbal, radicalism, employed, by, her, father, not, needing, to, clamor, for, a, socialist, identity, in, order, to, win, votes, and, allowing, her, to, be, a, pragmatist, in, both, word, and, deed, lamb, described, bhutto, at, being, skilled, in, using, populist, strategies, in, election, campaigns, in, a, 2007, article, for, the, los, angeles, times, bhutto, s, niece, fatima, bhutto, called, her, a, puppet, democrat, linked, to, the, u, s, government, s, neoconservative, agenda, under, bhutto, s, leadership, the, ppp, was, officially, secular, as, were, the, governments, which, she, led, however, in, pakistan, at, the, time, the, term, secularisation, was, often, understood, not, as, reflecting, the, separation, of, religious, institutions, and, the, state, but, rather, had, connotations, of, atheism, and, irreligion, thus, suvorova, argued, bhutto, opposed, the, secularisation, of, islamic, societies, bhutto, also, took, a, hard, stance, against, militant, islamism, although, she, had, to, compromise, with, pakistan, s, powerful, islamist, lobby, she, favored, a, secular, government, for, the, country, allen, wrote, that, at, no, time, in, her, years, in, power, did, bhutto, westernized, though, she, was, feel, comfortable, in, seriously, challenging, pakistan, s, islamists, although, during, her, campaigns, she, vowed, to, abolish, the, hudud, restrictions, on, women, that, zia, had, introduced, she, never, did, so, instead, these, were, revoked, by, musharraf, in, 2006, bhutto, was, indignant, when, faced, with, sexism, and, regarded, herself, as, an, ardent, supporter, of, women, s, rights, however, suvorova, stated, that, she, was, never, a, feminist, in, theory, or, practice, bhutto, expressed, the, view, that, there, were, differences, between, male, and, female, leaders, and, that, women, leaders, are, more, generous, and, forgiving, male, leaders, tend, to, be, more, inflexible, and, more, rigid, in, contrast, to, those, islamic, clerics, who, insisted, that, her, involvement, in, politics, contrasted, with, islamic, values, she, insisted, that, there, was, no, conflict, in, her, view, it, was, men, s, interpretation, of, our, religion, that, restricted, women, s, opportunities, not, our, religion, itself, islam, in, fact, had, been, quite, progressive, towards, women, from, its, inception, bhutto, described, her, main, role, model, as, fatimah, the, daughter, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, stating, that, she, admired, her, piety, wisdom, and, courage, she, also, described, the, indian, prime, minister, indira, gandhi, as, a, political, inspiration, according, to, bhutto, biographer, shyam, bhatia, bhutto, possessed, a, desire, to, be, liked, and, to, be, popular, and, for, this, reason, was, prepared, to, be, all, things, to, all, people, having, a, chameleon, like, quality, to, blend, into, her, environment, mu, oz, concurred, describing, bhutto, as, a, woman, of, contradictions, suvorova, similarly, observed, that, bhutto, presented, herself, differently, when, in, the, west, compared, to, when, she, was, in, pakistan, while, in, pakistan, bhutto, presented, herself, as, a, conservative, muslim, who, always, wore, her, head, covered, but, as, a, student, in, oxford, she, had, adopted, a, more, liberal, lifestyle, tending, to, wear, a, t, shirt, and, jeans, and, occasionally, drinking, wine, as, a, politician, she, was, conscious, of, how, her, image, was, presented, in, pakistan, she, dressed, modestly, was, never, photographed, with, a, glass, lest, it, is, interpreted, as, containing, alcohol, and, would, refuse, to, shake, men, s, hands, in, the, country, she, also, wore, a, white, dupatta, on, her, head, to, placate, islamist, opposition, her, mother, and, other, female, family, members, had, not, covered, their, hair, in, this, manner, the, journalist, christina, lamb, believed, that, in, being, raised, in, a, wealthy, and, aristocratic, family, bhutto, was, unable, to, appreciate, the, struggles, of, pakistan, s, poorest, the, islamic, studies, scholar, akbar, s, ahmed, who, went, to, school, with, bhutto, wrote, that, she, was, a, pampered, and, precocious, child, bhatia, claimed, that, at, oxford, where, he, first, met, her, bhutto, was, spoilt, self, obsessed, and, prone, to, throwing, temper, tantrums, although, at, the, same, time, was, humorous, and, generous, willing, to, pay, for, her, friends, meals, whenever, at, a, restaurant, allen, suggested, that, bhutto, retained, her, characteristic, de, haut, en, bas, arrogance, a, relic, of, her, feudal, upbringing, arguing, that, her, key, character, flaw, had, been, a, belief, in, the, special, almost, sacred, destiny, of, herself, and, the, bhutto, family, and, that, accordingly, while, she, spoke, like, a, democrat, she, thought, and, felt, as, a, dynast, in, later, life, bhutto, was, accused, of, being, addicted, to, power, although, allen, thought, it, more, accurate, to, state, that, she, was, addicted, to, adulation, suggesting, that, this, stemmed, from, a, narcissistic, element, to, bhutto, s, personality, familial, charisma, is, rare, but, in, benazir, s, case, the, bhutto, name, matters, in, that, her, father, s, charisma, easily, transferred, to, her, she, had, her, own, charisma, when, she, emerged, in, the, 1980s, as, a, young, articulate, well, educated, and, well, spoken, woman, her, chief, assets, were, her, intelligence, her, confidence, and, the, fact, that, she, could, talk, to, people, of, various, backgrounds, with, empathy, she, had, the, rare, quality, of, humor, which, she, never, lost, in, spite, of, leading, an, uncertain, and, challenging, life, above, all, she, could, use, the, media, effectively, her, faults, as, a, political, leader, were, many, too, many, stories, of, corruption, stuck, to, her, she, was, not, a, good, administrator, she, was, too, inclined, to, listen, to, her, small, kitchen, cabinet, which, very, often, consisted, of, people, who, would, say, what, they, thought, she, wanted, to, hear, she, became, prime, minister, at, a, particularly, young, age, and, had, no, prior, political, or, other, cabinet, experience, islamic, studies, scholar, akbar, s, ahmed, 2008, commentators, and, biographers, have, said, that, bhutto, shared, her, father, s, charisma, but, also, his, arrogance, and, that, like, him, she, was, impatient, with, criticism, the, connection, between, bhutto, and, her, father, was, endorsed, by, allen, who, stated, that, they, had, much, in, common, strength, charisma, political, instinct, and, the, courage, part, and, parcel, of, their, arrogance, that, was, so, characteristic, of, both, allen, also, believed, that, bhutto, was, so, dedicated, to, her, father, that, psychologically, she, was, unable, to, admit, to, any, imperfection, in, him, after, his, death, she, repeatedly, presented, his, execution, as, a, martyrdom, bhutto, imitated, many, of, her, father, s, mannerisms, and, his, style, of, speech, the, journalist, carla, hall, referred, to, her, having, a, vaguely, british, accent, she, was, an, accomplished, orator, having, honed, her, skill, at, public, speaking, while, president, of, the, oxford, debating, society, having, encountered, her, later, in, life, mu, oz, regarded, bhutto, as, a, charming, and, intelligent, woman, close, friends, called, her, bb, a, name, with, which, she, signed, some, of, her, personal, letters, her, parents, gave, her, the, childhood, nickname, of, pinkie, possibly, alluding, to, her, rosy, complexion, allen, described, bhutto, as, a, woman, of, action, rather, than, an, intellectual, bhutto, s, choice, of, reading, material, was, usually, either, utilitarian, or, pleasurable, rather, than, intellectual, she, enjoyed, reading, mills, boon, romance, novels, and, the, celebrity, focused, hello, magazine, she, read, a, number, of, self, help, books, telling, a, friend, that, for, all, the, lows, in, my, life, those, self, help, books, helped, me, survive, i, can, tell, you, her, father, had, also, encouraged, her, to, read, the, writings, of, various, prominent, political, figures, among, them, napoleon, bonaparte, otto, von, bismarck, vladimir, lenin, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, and, mao, zedong, she, had, a, love, of, french, and, italian, cuisine, and, was, a, great, fan, of, the, music, of, american, singer, neil, diamond, in, a, 2002, interview, with, the, guardian, bhutto, described, her, allegiance, to, the, sufi, branch, of, sunni, islam, allen, thought, her, to, have, some, genuine, if, unorthodox, religious, belief, mixed, up, with, superstition, bhargava, stated, that, bhutto, was, dedicated, and, devout, in, her, religious, principles, but, modern, and, emancipated, in, her, behavior, and, outlook, in, conversation, she, often, used, the, phrase, inshallah, and, insisted, that, the, quran, supported, the, equality, of, the, sexes, bhutto, was, anti, abortion, and, spoke, forcefully, against, abortion, most, notably, at, the, 1994, meeting, of, the, international, conference, on, population, and, development, in, cairo, where, she, accused, the, west, of, seeking, to, impose, adultery, abortion, intercourse, education, and, other, such, matters, on, individuals, societies, and, religions, which, have, their, own, social, ethos, bhutto, was, the, oldest, of, four, children, of, these, her, younger, sister, sanam, or, sunny, remained, close, to, her, throughout, her, life, on, returning, to, pakistan, in, 1987, bhutto, s, mother, arranged, for, her, marriage, to, the, businessman, asif, ali, zardari, many, of, her, friends, were, surprised, that, bhutto, acquiesced, to, islamic, tradition, given, her, liberal, attitudes, however, she, later, related, that, she, felt, obligations, to, my, family, and, my, religion, to, go, through, with, it, and, that, her, high, public, profile, made, it, difficult, for, her, to, find, a, husband, through, other, means, she, consistently, presented, an, image, of, respect, and, loyalty, for, her, husband, throughout, the, many, accusations, and, periods, of, imprisonment, he, faced, allen, commented, that, it, would, probably, never, be, known, how, happy, the, couple, s, marriage, was, for, bhutto, always, projected, support, and, loyalty, for, her, unpopular, mate, in, the, final, years, of, bhutto, s, life, she, and, her, husband, lived, apart, according, to, allen, she, would, have, been, aware, that, a, divorce, or, a, public, separation, would, have, resulted, in, the, end, of, her, political, career, in, pakistan, due, to, social, stigma, around, the, subject, in, a, 2007, interview, bhutto, said, that, she, and, her, husband, were, living, apart, because, of, his, medical, requirements, adding, that, she, visited, him, every, month, in, new, york, regarding, the, rumors, of, separation, in, 2008, bhutto, s, friend, victoria, schofield, said, that, the, marriage, should, not, be, judged, by, ordinary, standards, according, to, schofield, after, zardari, s, return, from, prison, the, bhuttos, marriage, was, going, through, a, process, of, readjustment, in, 2018, bhutto, s, friend, ron, suskind, described, the, marriage, as, probably, not, all, bad, although, added, that, bhutto, did, not, consider, her, husband, to, be, an, equal, partner, in, the, marriage, the, couple, had, three, children, a, son, bilawal, was, born, in, september, 1988, while, she, was, campaigning, for, that, year, s, election, she, also, had, two, daughters, bakhtawar, born, on, 25, january, 1990, and, aseefa, born, on, 3, february, 1993, when, she, gave, birth, to, bakhtawar, she, became, the, first, elected, head, of, government, to, give, birth, while, in, office, bhutto, was, devoted, to, her, father, and, husband, in, later, life, she, increasingly, came, to, see, success, through, the, prism, of, her, family, the, benazir, bhutto, of, 1988, was, a, uniting, figure, for, her, country, that, of, twenty, years, later, a, divisive, one, in, retrospect, her, best, and, worst, qualities, seem, so, intimately, linked, that, the, course, of, her, career, might, almost, have, been, predicted, biographer, brooke, allen, 2016, mu, oz, described, bhutto, as, one, of, pakistan, s, most, important, political, figures, a, respected, world, leader, and, the, leading, stateswoman, in, the, islamic, world, allen, suggested, that, although, bhutto, s, record, in, office, was, that, of, a, corrupt, compromised, politician, she, displayed, admirable, qualities, especially, valor, in, the, face, of, opposition, within, the, islamic, world, bhutto, was, often, regarded, as, a, genuine, muslim, political, leader, and, recognised, as, the, head, of, pakistan, s, most, popular, political, party, bhargava, expressed, the, view, that, at, the, time, of, her, initial, election, bhutto, s, personal, popularity, was, tremendous, larger, than, any, that, her, father, had, previously, achieved, with, suvorova, suggesting, that, at, this, point, in, her, life, bhutto, was, often, regarded, as, a, quasi, saint, by, her, supporters, in, 1996, the, guinness, book, of, records, named, her, the, most, popular, international, politician, of, the, year, and, she, also, received, such, awards, at, the, french, legion, of, honour, and, oxford, university, s, doctor, honours, causa, at, the, same, time, there, were, many, pakistanis, who, despised, her, disliking, her, popularity, her, ties, to, western, nations, and, her, modernizing, agenda, extremist, sunni, islamist, elements, opposed, her, because, of, their, belief, that, female, leaders, are, un, islamic, and, because, she, was, a, shia, muslim, they, maintained, that, her, participation, in, politics, meant, associating, with, men, to, whom, she, was, not, related, and, that, this, compromised, the, modesty, required, by, islam, conservative, clerical, opponents, also, claimed, that, by, being, prime, minister, bhutto, was, failing, her, religious, duty, which, was, to, focus, her, energies, on, having, as, many, children, as, possible, ahmed, stated, that, bhutto, was, one, of, the, very, few, political, leaders, who, had, been, able, to, assume, the, iconic, status, of, a, political, martyr, in, the, west, while, simultaneously, evoking, strong, sentiments, in, the, muslim, world, he, therefore, contrasted, her, with, contemporaries, like, iraq, s, saddam, hussein, who, were, popular, domestically, but, hated, in, the, west, and, those, like, egypt, s, hosni, mubarak, who, curried, favor, with, western, governments, while, alienating, their, domestic, audience, bhutto, gained, popularity, in, western, nations, in, part, because, she, could, present, herself, as, being, part, of, their, world, speaking, a, high, standard, of, english, and, having, been, educated, at, harvard, and, oxford, while, her, western, supporters, sometimes, had, doubts, about, her, ability, to, govern, they, generally, viewed, her, as, a, progressive, figure, who, could, advance, democracy, and, counter, terrorism, in, pakistan, allen, commented, that, the, cards, might, have, been, stacked, in, bhutto, s, favor, she, was, rich, educated, aristocratic, the, favored, daughter, of, a, very, powerful, father, nevertheless, her, achievement, was, a, remarkable, one, given, the, male, dominated, environment, of, late, 20th, century, pakistani, society, mushtaq, ahmed, similarly, believed, that, for, a, woman, to, win, an, election, in, a, male, dominated, society, was, an,
