known, as, kamehameha, the, great, was, the, conqueror, and, first, ruler, of, the, kingdom, of, hawaii, the, state, of, hawaii, gave, a, statue, of, him, to, the, national, statuary, hall, collection, in, washington, d, c, as, one, of, two, statues, it, is, entitled, to, install, there, kamehameha, known, as, pai, ea, at, birth, was, born, to, keku, iapoiwa, ii, the, niece, of, alapainui, the, usurping, ruler, of, hawaii, island, who, had, killed, the, two, legitimate, heirs, of, keawe, kekahiali, iokamoku, during, civil, war, by, most, accounts, he, was, born, in, ainakea, kohala, hawaii, his, father, was, ke, ua, kalanikupuapa, ikalaninui, however, native, hawaiian, historian, samuel, kamakau, says, that, maui, monarch, kahekili, ii, had, h, nai, adopted, traditional, informal, adoption, kamehameha, at, birth, as, was, the, custom, of, the, time, kamakau, believes, this, is, why, kahekili, ii, is, often, referred, to, as, kamehameha, s, father, the, author, also, says, that, kame, eiamoku, told, kamehameha, i, that, he, was, the, son, of, kahekili, ii, saying, i, have, something, to, tell, you, ka, hekili, was, your, father, you, were, not, keoua, s, son, here, are, the, tokens, that, you, are, the, son, of, ka, hekili, king, kal, kaua, wrote, that, these, rumors, were, scandals, and, should, be, dismissed, as, the, offspring, of, hatred, and, jealousies, of, later, years, regardless, of, the, rumors, kamehameha, was, a, descendant, of, keawe, through, his, mother, keku, iapoiwa, ii, ke, ua, acknowledged, him, as, his, son, and, he, is, recognized, as, such, by, all, the, sovereigns, and, most, genealogists, accounts, of, kamehameha, i, s, birth, vary, but, sources, place, his, birth, between, 1736, and, 1761, with, historian, ralph, simpson, kuykendall, believing, it, to, be, between, 1748, and, 1761, an, early, source, is, thought, to, imply, a, 1758, dating, because, that, date, matched, a, visit, from, halley, s, comet, and, would, make, him, close, to, the, age, that, francisco, de, paula, mar, n, estimated, he, was, this, dating, however, does, not, accord, with, the, details, of, many, well, known, accounts, of, his, life, such, as, his, fighting, as, a, warrior, with, his, uncle, kalani, pu, u, or, his, being, of, age, to, father, his, first, children, by, that, time, the, 1758, dating, also, places, his, birth, after, the, death, of, his, father, kamakau, published, an, account, in, the, ka, nupepa, kuokoa, in, 1867, placing, the, date, of, kamehameha, s, birth, around, 1736, he, wrote, it, was, during, the, time, of, the, warfare, among, the, chiefs, of, hawaii, which, followed, the, death, of, keawe, chief, over, the, whole, island, ke, awe, i, kekahi, ali, i, o, ka, moku, that, kamehameha, i, was, born, however, his, general, dating, has, been, challenged, as, twenty, years, too, early, related, to, disputes, over, kamakau, s, inaccuracy, of, dating, compared, to, accounts, of, foreign, visitors, regardless, abraham, fornander, wrote, in, his, book, an, account, of, the, polynesian, race, its, origins, and, migrations, when, kamehameha, died, in, 1819, he, was, past, eighty, years, old, his, birth, would, thus, fall, between, 1736, and, 1740, probably, nearer, the, former, than, the, latter, a, brief, history, of, the, hawaiian, people, by, william, de, witt, alexander, lists, the, birth, date, in, the, chronological, table, of, events, of, hawaiian, history, as, 1736, in, 1888, the, kamakau, account, was, challenged, by, samuel, c, damon, in, the, missionary, publication, the, friend, deferring, to, a, 1753, dating, that, was, the, first, mentioned, by, james, jackson, jarves, but, the, kamakau, dating, was, widely, accepted, due, to, support, from, abraham, fornander, at, the, time, of, kamehameha, s, birth, his, father, ke, ua, along, with, his, half, brother, kalani, pu, u, were, serving, alapa, inui, ruler, of, the, island, of, hawai, i, alapa, inui, had, brought, the, brothers, to, his, court, after, defeating, both, of, their, fathers, in, the, civil, war, that, followed, the, death, of, keawe, kekahiali, iokamoku, ke, ua, had, died, while, kamehameha, was, very, young, thus, the, boy, was, raised, in, the, court, of, his, uncle, kalani, pu, u, the, traditional, mele, chant, of, keakamahana, chiefess, and, wife, of, alapainui, mentions, that, kamehameha, was, born, in, the, month, of, ikuw, autumn, winter, or, around, november, alapai, gave, the, young, kamehameha, to, keaka, and, her, sister, h, kau, to, raise, once, the, ruler, discovered, the, infant, had, indeed, survived, on, february, 10, 1911, the, kamakau, version, was, challenged, by, the, oral, history, of, the, kaha, family, as, published, in, newspaper, articles, also, appearing, in, the, kuoko, after, kamakau, s, history, was, published, again, this, time, to, a, wider, english, reading, public, in, 1911, hawaii, the, kaha, version, of, these, events, was, published, by, kamaka, stillman, who, had, objected, to, the, nupepa, article, kamehameha, was, raised, in, the, royal, court, of, his, uncle, kalani, pu, u, he, achieved, prominence, in, 1782, upon, kalani, pu, u, s, death, while, the, kingship, was, inherited, by, k, wala, kalani, pu, u, s, son, kamehameha, was, given, a, prominent, religious, position, as, guardian, of, the, hawaiian, god, of, war, k, ka, ilimoku, he, was, also, given, control, of, the, district, of, waipi, o, valley, the, two, cousins, relationship, was, strained, after, kamehameha, made, a, dedication, to, the, gods, instead, of, allowing, k, wala, to, do, that, kamehameha, accepted, the, allegiance, of, a, group, of, chiefs, from, the, kona, district, the, other, story, took, place, after, the, prophecy, was, passed, along, by, the, high, priests, and, high, chiefs, when, kamehameha, was, able, to, lift, the, naha, stone, he, was, considered, the, fulfiller, of, the, prophecy, other, ruling, chiefs, keawe, mauhili, the, mahoe, twins, keoua, and, other, chiefs, rejected, the, prophecy, of, ka, poukahi, the, high, chiefs, of, kauai, supported, kiwala, o, even, after, learning, about, the, prophecy, the,

of, chiefs, planned, to, unite, the, rest, of, the, hawaiian, islands, allies, came, from, british, and, american, traders, who, sold, guns, and, ammunition, to, kamehameha, another, major, factor, in, kamehameha, s, continued, success, was, the, support, of, kauai, chief, ka, iana, and, captain, william, brown, of, the, butterworth, squadron, he, guaranteed, kamehameha, unlimited, gunpowder, from, china, and, gave, him, the, formula, for, gunpowder, sulfur, saltpeter, and, charcoal, all, of, which, are, abundant, in, the, islands, two, westerners, who, lived, on, hawai, i, island, isaac,

during, their, interactions, the, chief, is, allegedly, to, have, offended, or, insulted, captain, metcalfe, somehow, causing, him, to, strike, the, chief, with, a, rope, s, end, sometime, later, while, docked, in, honolua, maui, a, small, boat, which, was, tied, to, the, larger, ship, and, had, a, crewman, inside, was, stolen, by, native, islanders, when, metcalfe, discovered, where, the, boat, was, taken, he, sailed, directly, to, the, village, of, olowalu, there, he, confirmed, that, the, boat, had, been, broken, apart, and, the, shipmate, murdered, previously, metcalfe, had, resorted, to, violence, when, he, fired, muskets, into, another, village, near, where, he, had, been, anchored, ultimately, killing, some, of, the, residents, this, time, furious, metcalfe, took, aim, at, olowalu, ordering, all, cannons, aboard, the, ship, to, be, moved, to, one, side, facing, the, island, as, the, captain, initiated, his, trading, calls, and, greetings, to, the, locals, hundreds,

son, and, all, but, one, isaac, davis, of, the, five, crewmen, kamehameha, took, davis, into, protection, and, took, possession, of, the, ship, eleanora, was, at, that, time, anchored, at, kealakekua,

there, hoapili, knew, that, they, were, being, followed, so, he, turned, around, kamehameha, had, many, wives, the, exact, number, is, debated, because, documents, that, recorded, the, names, of, his,
