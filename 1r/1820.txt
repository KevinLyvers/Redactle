charles, babbage, kh, frs, b, b, d, 26, december, 1791, 18, october, 1871, was, an, english, polymath, a, mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and, mechanical, engineer, babbage, originated, the, concept, of, a, digital, programmable, computer, babbage, is, considered, by, some, to, be, father, of, the, computer, he, is, credited, with, inventing, the, first, mechanical, computer, the, difference, engine, that, eventually, led, to, more, complex, electronic, designs, though, all, the, essential, ideas, of, modern, computers, are, to, be, found, in, his, analytical, engine, programmed, using, a, principle, openly, borrowed, from, the, jacquard, loom, babbage, had, a, broad, range, of, interests, in, addition, to, his, work, on, computers, covered, in, his, 1832, book, economy, of, manufactures, and, machinery, he, was, an, important, figure, in, the, social, scene, in, london, and, is, credited, with, importing, the, scientific, soir, e, from, france, with, his, well, attended, saturday, evening, soir, es, his, varied, work, in, other, fields, has, led, him, to, be, described, as, pre, eminent, among, the, many, polymaths, of, his, century, babbage, who, died, before, the, complete, successful, engineering, of, many, of, his, designs, including, his, difference, engine, and, analytical, engine, remained, a, prominent, figure, in, the, ideating, of, computing, parts, of, his, incomplete, mechanisms, are, on, display, in, the, science, museum, in, london, in, 1991, a, functioning, difference, engine, was, constructed, from, the, original, plans, built, to, tolerances, achievable, in, the, 19th, century, the, success, of, the, finished, engine, indicated, that, babbage, s, machine, would, have, worked, babbage, s, birthplace, is, disputed, but, according, to, the, oxford, dictionary, of, national, biography, he, was, most, likely, born, at, 44, crosby, row, walworth, road, london, england, a, blue, plaque, on, the, junction, of, larcom, street, and, walworth, road, commemorates, the, event, his, date, of, birth, was, given, in, his, obituary, in, the, times, as, 26, december, 1792, but, then, a, nephew, wrote, to, say, that, babbage, was, born, one, year, earlier, in, 1791, the, parish, register, of, st, mary, s, newington, london, shows, that, babbage, was, baptised, on, 6, january, 1792, supporting, a, birth, year, of, 1791, babbage, was, one, of, four, children, of, benjamin, babbage, and, betsy, plumleigh, teape, his, father, was, a, banking, partner, of, william, praed, in, founding, praed, s, co, of, fleet, street, london, in, 1801, in, 1808, the, babbage, family, moved, into, the, old, rowdens, house, in, east, teignmouth, around, the, age, of, eight, babbage, was, sent, to, a, country, school, in, alphington, near, exeter, to, recover, from, a, life, threatening, fever, for, a, short, time, he, attended, king, edward, vi, grammar, school, in, totnes, south, devon, but, his, health, forced, him, back, to, private, tutors, for, a, time, babbage, then, joined, the, 30, student, holmwood, academy, in, baker, street, enfield, middlesex, under, the, reverend, stephen, freeman, the, academy, had, a, library, that, prompted, babbage, s, love, of, mathematics, he, studied, with, two, more, private, tutors, after, leaving, the, academy, the, first, was, a, clergyman, near, cambridge, through, him, babbage, encountered, charles, simeon, and, his, evangelical, followers, but, the, tuition, was, not, what, he, needed, he, was, brought, home, to, study, at, the, totnes, school, this, was, at, age, 16, or, 17, the, second, was, an, oxford, tutor, under, whom, babbage, reached, a, level, in, classics, sufficient, to, be, accepted, by, the, university, of, cambridge, babbage, arrived, at, trinity, college, cambridge, in, october, 1810, he, was, already, self, taught, in, some, parts, of, contemporary, mathematics, he, had, read, robert, woodhouse, joseph, louis, lagrange, and, marie, agnesi, as, a, result, he, was, disappointed, in, the, standard, mathematical, instruction, available, at, the, university, babbage, john, herschel, george, peacock, and, several, other, friends, formed, the, analytical, society, in, 1812, they, were, also, close, to, edward, ryan, as, a, student, babbage, was, also, a, member, of, other, societies, such, as, the, ghost, club, concerned, with, investigating, supernatural, phenomena, and, the, extractors, club, dedicated, to, liberating, its, members, from, the, madhouse, should, any, be, committed, to, one, in, 1812, babbage, transferred, to, peterhouse, cambridge, he, was, the, top, mathematician, there, but, did, not, graduate, with, honours, he, instead, received, a, degree, without, examination, in, 1814, he, had, defended, a, thesis, that, was, considered, blasphemous, in, the, preliminary, public, disputation, but, it, is, not, known, whether, this, fact, is, related, to, his, not, sitting, the, examination, considering, his, reputation, babbage, quickly, made, progress, he, lectured, to, the, royal, institution, on, astronomy, in, 1815, and, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1816, after, graduation, on, the, other, hand, he, applied, for, positions, unsuccessfully, and, had, little, in, the, way, of, a, career, in, 1816, he, was, a, candidate, for, a, teaching, job, at, haileybury, college, he, had, recommendations, from, james, ivory, and, john, playfair, but, lost, out, to, henry, walter, in, 1819, babbage, and, herschel, visited, paris, and, the, society, of, arcueil, meeting, leading, french, mathematicians, and, physicists, that, year, babbage, applied, to, be, professor, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, with, the, recommendation, of, pierre, simon, laplace, the, post, went, to, william, wallace, with, herschel, babbage, worked, on, the, electrodynamics, of, arago, s, rotations, publishing, in, 1825, their, explanations, were, only, transitional, being, picked, up, and, broadened, by, michael, faraday, the, phenomena, are, now, part, of, the, theory, of, eddy, currents, and, babbage, and, herschel, missed, some, of, the, clues, to, unification, of, electromagnetic, theory, staying, close, to, amp, re, s, force, law, babbage, purchased, the, actuarial, tables, of, george, barrett, who, died, in, 1821, leaving, unpublished, work, and, surveyed, the, field, in, 1826, in, comparative, view, of, the, various, institutions, for, the, assurance, of, lives, this, interest, followed, a, project, to, set, up, an, insurance, company, prompted, by, francis, baily, and, mooted, in, 1824, but, not, carried, out, babbage, did, calculate, actuarial, tables, for, that, scheme, using, equitable, society, mortality, data, from, 1762, onwards, during, this, whole, period, babbage, depended, awkwardly, on, his, father, s, support, given, his, father, s, attitude, to, his, early, marriage, of, 1814, he, and, edward, ryan, wedded, the, whitmore, sisters, he, made, a, home, in, marylebone, in, london, and, established, a, large, family, on, his, father, s, death, in, 1827, babbage, inherited, a, large, estate, value, around, 100, 000, equivalent, to, 10, 9, million, or, 15, million, today, making, him, independently, wealthy, after, his, wife, s, death, in, the, same, year, he, spent, time, travelling, in, italy, he, met, leopold, ii, grand, duke, of, tuscany, foreshadowing, a, later, visit, to, piedmont, in, april, 1828, he, was, in, rome, and, relying, on, herschel, to, manage, the, difference, engine, project, when, he, heard, that, he, had, become, a, professor, at, cambridge, a, position, he, had, three, times, failed, to, obtain, in, 1820, 1823, and, 1826, babbage, was, instrumental, in, founding, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, 1820, initially, known, as, the, astronomical, society, of, london, its, original, aims, were, to, reduce, astronomical, calculations, to, a, more, standard, form, and, to, circulate, data, these, directions, were, closely, connected, with, babbage, s, ideas, on, computation, and, in, 1824, he, won, its, gold, medal, cited, for, his, invention, of, an, engine, for, calculating, mathematical, and, astronomical, tables, babbage, s, motivation, to, overcome, errors, in, tables, by, mechanisation, had, been, a, commonplace, since, dionysius, lardner, wrote, about, it, in, 1834, in, the, edinburgh, review, under, babbage, s, guidance, the, context, of, these, developments, is, still, debated, babbage, s, own, account, of, the, origin, of, the, difference, engine, begins, with, the, astronomical, society, s, wish, to, improve, the, nautical, almanac, babbage, and, herschel, were, asked, to, oversee, a, trial, project, to, recalculate, some, part, of, those, tables, with, the, results, to, hand, discrepancies, were, found, this, was, in, 1821, or, 1822, and, was, the, occasion, on, which, babbage, formulated, his, idea, for, mechanical, computation, the, issue, of, the, nautical, almanac, is, now, described, as, a, legacy, of, a, polarisation, in, british, science, caused, by, attitudes, to, sir, joseph, banks, who, had, died, in, 1820, babbage, studied, the, requirements, to, establish, a, modern, postal, system, with, his, friend, thomas, frederick, colby, concluding, there, should, be, a, uniform, rate, that, was, put, into, effect, with, the, introduction, of, the, uniform, fourpenny, post, supplanted, by, the, uniform, penny, post, in, 1839, and, 1840, colby, was, another, of, the, founding, group, of, the, society, he, was, also, in, charge, of, the, survey, of, ireland, herschel, and, babbage, were, present, at, a, celebrated, operation, of, that, survey, the, remeasuring, of, the, lough, foyle, baseline, the, analytical, society, had, initially, been, no, more, than, an, undergraduate, provocation, during, this, period, it, had, some, more, substantial, achievements, in, 1816, babbage, herschel, and, peacock, published, a, translation, from, french, of, the, lectures, of, sylvestre, lacroix, which, was, then, the, state, of, the, art, calculus, textbook, reference, to, lagrange, in, calculus, terms, marks, out, the, application, of, what, are, now, called, formal, power, series, british, mathematicians, had, used, them, from, about, 1730, to, 1760, as, re, introduced, they, were, not, simply, applied, as, notations, in, differential, calculus, they, opened, up, the, fields, of, functional, equations, including, the, difference, equations, fundamental, to, the, difference, engine, and, operator, d, module, methods, for, differential, equations, the, analogy, of, difference, and, differential, equations, was, notationally, changing, to, d, as, a, finite, difference, becomes, infinitesimal, these, symbolic, directions, became, popular, as, operational, calculus, and, pushed, to, the, point, of, diminishing, returns, the, cauchy, concept, of, limit, was, kept, at, bay, woodhouse, had, already, founded, this, second, british, lagrangian, school, with, its, treatment, of, taylor, series, as, formal, in, this, context, function, composition, is, complicated, to, express, because, the, chain, rule, is, not, simply, applied, to, second, and, higher, derivatives, this, matter, was, known, to, woodhouse, by, 1803, who, took, from, louis, fran, ois, antoine, arbogast, what, is, now, called, fa, di, bruno, s, formula, in, essence, it, was, known, to, abraham, de, moivre, 1697, herschel, found, the, method, impressive, babbage, knew, of, it, and, it, was, later, noted, by, ada, lovelace, as, compatible, with, the, analytical, engine, in, the, period, to, 1820, babbage, worked, intensively, on, functional, equations, in, general, and, resisted, both, conventional, finite, differences, and, arbogast, s, approach, in, which, and, d, were, related, by, the, simple, additive, case, of, the, exponential, map, but, via, herschel, he, was, influenced, by, arbogast, s, ideas, in, the, matter, of, iteration, i, e, composing, a, function, with, itself, possibly, many, times, writing, in, a, major, paper, on, functional, equations, in, the, philosophical, transactions, 1815, 6, babbage, said, his, starting, point, was, work, of, gaspard, monge, from, 1828, to, 1839, babbage, was, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, at, cambridge, not, a, conventional, resident, don, and, inattentive, to, his, teaching, responsibilities, he, wrote, three, topical, books, during, this, period, of, his, life, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1832, babbage, was, out, of, sympathy, with, colleagues, george, biddell, airy, his, predecessor, as, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, at, trinity, college, cambridge, thought, an, issue, should, be, made, of, his, lack, of, interest, in, lecturing, babbage, planned, to, lecture, in, 1831, on, political, economy, babbage, s, reforming, direction, looked, to, see, university, education, more, inclusive, universities, doing, more, for, research, a, broader, syllabus, and, more, interest, in, applications, but, william, whewell, found, the, programme, unacceptable, a, controversy, babbage, had, with, richard, jones, lasted, for, six, years, he, never, did, give, a, lecture, it, was, during, this, period, that, babbage, tried, to, enter, politics, simon, schaffer, writes, that, his, views, of, the, 1830s, included, disestablishment, of, the, church, of, england, a, broader, political, franchise, and, inclusion, of, manufacturers, as, stakeholders, he, twice, stood, for, parliament, as, a, candidate, for, the, borough, of, finsbury, in, 1832, he, came, in, third, among, five, candidates, missing, out, by, some, 500, votes, in, the, two, member, constituency, when, two, other, reformist, candidates, thomas, wakley, and, christopher, temple, split, the, vote, in, his, memoirs, babbage, related, how, this, election, brought, him, the, friendship, of, samuel, rogers, his, brother, henry, rogers, wished, to, support, babbage, again, but, died, within, days, in, 1834, babbage, finished, last, among, four, in, 1832, babbage, herschel, and, ivory, were, appointed, knights, of, the, royal, guelphic, order, however, they, were, not, subsequently, made, knights, bachelor, to, entitle, them, to, the, prefix, sir, which, often, came, with, appointments, to, that, foreign, order, though, herschel, was, later, created, a, baronet, babbage, now, emerged, as, a, polemicist, one, of, his, biographers, notes, that, all, his, books, contain, a, campaigning, element, his, reflections, on, the, decline, of, science, and, some, of, its, causes, 1830, stands, out, however, for, its, sharp, attacks, it, aimed, to, improve, british, science, and, more, particularly, to, oust, davies, gilbert, as, president, of, the, royal, society, which, babbage, wished, to, reform, it, was, written, out, of, pique, when, babbage, hoped, to, become, the, junior, secretary, of, the, royal, society, as, herschel, was, the, senior, but, failed, because, of, his, antagonism, to, humphry, davy, michael, faraday, had, a, reply, written, by, gerrit, moll, as, on, the, alleged, decline, of, science, in, england, 1831, on, the, front, of, the, royal, society, babbage, had, no, impact, with, the, bland, election, of, the, duke, of, sussex, to, succeed, gilbert, the, same, year, as, a, broad, manifesto, on, the, other, hand, his, decline, led, promptly, to, the, formation, in, 1831, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, baas, the, mechanics, magazine, in, 1831, identified, as, declinarians, the, followers, of, babbage, in, an, unsympathetic, tone, it, pointed, out, david, brewster, writing, in, the, quarterly, review, as, another, leader, with, the, barb, that, both, babbage, and, brewster, had, received, public, money, in, the, debate, of, the, period, on, statistics, qua, data, collection, and, what, is, now, statistical, inference, the, baas, in, its, statistical, section, which, owed, something, also, to, whewell, opted, for, data, collection, this, section, was, the, sixth, established, in, 1833, with, babbage, as, chairman, and, john, elliot, drinkwater, as, secretary, the, foundation, of, the, statistical, society, followed, babbage, was, its, public, face, backed, by, richard, jones, and, robert, malthus, babbage, published, on, the, economy, of, machinery, and, manufactures, 1832, on, the, organisation, of, industrial, production, it, was, an, influential, early, work, of, operational, research, john, rennie, the, younger, in, addressing, the, institution, of, civil, engineers, on, manufacturing, in, 1846, mentioned, mostly, surveys, in, encyclopaedias, and, babbage, s, book, was, first, an, article, in, the, encyclop, dia, metropolitana, the, form, in, which, rennie, noted, it, in, the, company, of, related, works, by, john, farey, jr, peter, barlow, and, andrew, ure, from, an, essay, on, the, general, principles, which, regulate, the, application, of, machinery, to, manufactures, and, the, mechanical, arts, 1827, which, became, the, encyclop, dia, metropolitana, article, of, 1829, babbage, developed, the, schematic, classification, of, machines, that, combined, with, discussion, of, factories, made, up, the, first, part, of, the, book, the, second, part, considered, the, domestic, and, political, economy, of, manufactures, the, book, sold, well, and, quickly, went, to, a, fourth, edition, 1836, babbage, represented, his, work, as, largely, a, result, of, actual, observations, in, factories, british, and, abroad, it, was, not, in, its, first, edition, intended, to, address, deeper, questions, of, political, economy, the, second, late, 1832, did, with, three, further, chapters, including, one, on, piece, rate, the, book, also, contained, ideas, on, rational, design, in, factories, and, profit, sharing, in, economy, of, machinery, was, described, what, is, now, called, the, babbage, principle, it, pointed, out, commercial, advantages, available, with, more, careful, division, of, labour, as, babbage, himself, noted, it, had, already, appeared, in, the, work, of, melchiorre, gioia, in, 1815, the, term, was, introduced, in, 1974, by, harry, braverman, related, formulations, are, the, principle, of, multiples, of, philip, sargant, florence, and, the, balance, of, processes, what, babbage, remarked, is, that, skilled, workers, typically, spend, parts, of, their, time, performing, tasks, that, are, below, their, skill, level, if, the, labour, process, can, be, divided, among, several, workers, labour, costs, may, be, cut, by, assigning, only, high, skill, tasks, to, high, cost, workers, restricting, other, tasks, to, lower, paid, workers, he, also, pointed, out, that, training, or, apprenticeship, can, be, taken, as, fixed, costs, but, that, returns, to, scale, are, available, by, his, approach, of, standardisation, of, tasks, therefore, again, favouring, the, factory, system, his, view, of, human, capital, was, restricted, to, minimising, the, time, period, for, recovery, of, training, costs, another, aspect, of, the, work, was, its, detailed, breakdown, of, the, cost, structure, of, book, publishing, babbage, took, the, unpopular, line, from, the, publishers, perspective, of, exposing, the, trade, s, profitability, he, went, as, far, as, to, name, the, organisers, of, the, trade, s, restrictive, practices, twenty, years, later, he, attended, a, meeting, hosted, by, john, chapman, to, campaign, against, the, booksellers, association, still, a, cartel, it, has, been, written, that, what, arthur, young, was, to, agriculture, charles, babbage, was, to, the, factory, visit, and, machinery, babbage, s, theories, are, said, to, have, influenced, the, layout, of, the, 1851, great, exhibition, and, his, views, had, a, strong, effect, on, his, contemporary, george, julius, poulett, scrope, karl, marx, argued, that, the, source, of, the, productivity, of, the, factory, system, was, exactly, the, combination, of, the, division, of, labour, with, machinery, building, on, adam, smith, babbage, and, ure, where, marx, picked, up, on, babbage, and, disagreed, with, smith, was, on, the, motivation, for, division, of, labour, by, the, manufacturer, as, babbage, did, he, wrote, that, it, was, for, the, sake, of, profitability, rather, than, productivity, and, identified, an, impact, on, the, concept, of, a, trade, john, ruskin, went, further, to, oppose, completely, what, manufacturing, in, babbage, s, sense, stood, for, babbage, also, affected, the, economic, thinking, of, john, stuart, mill, george, holyoake, saw, babbage, s, detailed, discussion, of, profit, sharing, as, substantive, in, the, tradition, of, robert, owen, and, charles, fourier, if, requiring, the, attentions, of, a, benevolent, captain, of, industry, and, ignored, at, the, time, charles, babbage, s, saturday, night, soir, es, held, from, 1828, into, the, 1840s, were, important, gathering, places, for, prominent, scientists, authors, and, aristocracy, babbage, is, credited, with, importing, the, scientific, soir, e, from, france, with, his, well, attended, saturday, evening, soir, es, works, by, babbage, and, ure, were, published, in, french, translation, in, 1830, on, the, economy, of, machinery, was, translated, in, 1833, into, french, by, douard, biot, and, into, german, the, same, year, by, gottfried, friedenberg, the, french, engineer, and, writer, on, industrial, organisation, l, on, lalanne, was, influenced, by, babbage, but, also, by, the, economist, claude, lucien, bergery, in, reducing, the, issues, to, technology, william, jevons, connected, babbage, s, economy, of, labour, with, his, own, labour, experiments, of, 1870, the, babbage, principle, is, an, inherent, assumption, in, frederick, winslow, taylor, s, scientific, management, mary, everest, boole, claimed, that, there, was, profound, influence, via, her, uncle, george, everest, of, indian, thought, in, general, and, indian, logic, in, particular, on, babbage, and, on, her, husband, george, boole, as, well, as, on, augustus, de, morgan, think, what, must, have, been, the, effect, of, the, intense, hinduizing, of, three, such, men, as, babbage, de, morgan, and, george, boole, on, the, mathematical, atmosphere, of, 1830, 65, what, share, had, it, in, generating, the, vector, analysis, and, the, mathematics, by, which, investigations, in, physical, science, are, now, conducted, in, 1837, responding, to, the, series, of, eight, bridgewater, treatises, babbage, published, his, ninth, bridgewater, treatise, under, the, title, on, the, power, wisdom, and, goodness, of, god, as, manifested, in, the, creation, in, this, work, babbage, weighed, in, on, the, side, of, uniformitarianism, in, a, current, debate, he, preferred, the, conception, of, creation, in, which, a, god, given, natural, law, dominated, removing, the, need, for, continuous, contrivance, the, book, is, a, work, of, natural, theology, and, incorporates, extracts, from, related, correspondence, of, herschel, with, charles, lyell, babbage, put, forward, the, thesis, that, god, had, the, omnipotence, and, foresight, to, create, as, a, divine, legislator, in, this, book, babbage, dealt, with, relating, interpretations, between, science, and, religion, on, the, one, hand, he, insisted, that, there, exists, no, fatal, collision, between, the, words, of, scripture, and, the, facts, of, nature, on, the, other, hand, he, wrote, that, the, book, of, genesis, was, not, meant, to, be, read, literally, in, relation, to, scientific, terms, against, those, who, said, these, were, in, conflict, he, wrote, that, the, contradiction, they, have, imagined, can, have, no, real, existence, and, that, whilst, the, testimony, of, moses, remains, unimpeached, we, may, also, be, permitted, to, confide, in, the, testimony, of, our, senses, the, ninth, bridgewater, treatise, was, quoted, extensively, in, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, the, parallel, with, babbage, s, computing, machines, is, made, explicit, as, allowing, plausibility, to, the, theory, that, transmutation, of, species, could, be, pre, programmed, jonar, ganeri, author, of, indian, logic, believes, babbage, may, have, been, influenced, by, indian, thought, one, possible, route, would, be, through, henry, thomas, colebrooke, mary, everest, boole, argues, that, babbage, was, introduced, to, indian, thought, in, the, 1820s, by, her, uncle, george, everest, some, time, about, 1825, came, to, england, for, two, or, three, years, and, made, a, fast, and, lifelong, friendship, with, herschel, and, with, babbage, who, was, then, quite, young, i, would, ask, any, fair, minded, mathematician, to, read, babbage, s, ninth, bridgewater, treatise, and, compare, it, with, the, works, of, his, contemporaries, in, england, and, then, ask, himself, whence, came, the, peculiar, conception, of, the, nature, of, miracle, which, underlies, babbage, s, ideas, of, singular, points, on, curves, chap, viii, from, european, theology, or, hindu, metaphysic, oh, how, the, english, clergy, of, that, day, hated, babbage, s, book, babbage, was, raised, in, the, protestant, form, of, the, christian, faith, his, family, having, inculcated, in, him, an, orthodox, form, of, worship, he, explained, my, excellent, mother, taught, me, the, usual, forms, of, my, daily, and, nightly, prayer, and, neither, in, my, father, nor, my, mother, was, there, any, mixture, of, bigotry, and, intolerance, on, the, one, hand, nor, on, the, other, of, that, unbecoming, and, familiar, mode, of, addressing, the, almighty, which, afterwards, so, much, disgusted, me, in, my, youthful, years, rejecting, the, athanasian, creed, as, a, direct, contradiction, in, terms, in, his, youth, he, looked, to, samuel, clarke, s, works, on, religion, of, which, being, and, attributes, of, god, 1704, exerted, a, particularly, strong, influence, on, him, later, in, life, babbage, concluded, that, the, true, value, of, the, christian, religion, rested, not, on, speculative, but, upon, those, doctrines, of, kindness, and, benevolence, which, that, religion, claims, and, enforces, not, merely, in, favour, of, man, himself, but, of, every, creature, susceptible, of, pain, or, of, happiness, in, his, autobiography, passages, from, the, life, of, a, philosopher, 1864, babbage, wrote, a, whole, chapter, on, the, topic, of, religion, where, he, identified, three, sources, of, divine, knowledge, he, stated, on, the, basis, of, the, design, argument, that, studying, the, works, of, nature, had, been, the, more, appealing, evidence, and, the, one, which, led, him, to, actively, profess, the, existence, of, god, advocating, for, natural, theology, he, wrote, in, the, works, of, the, creator, ever, open, to, our, examination, we, possess, a, firm, basis, on, which, to, raise, the, superstructure, of, an, enlightened, creed, the, more, man, inquires, into, the, laws, which, regulate, the, material, universe, the, more, he, is, convinced, that, all, its, varied, forms, arise, from, the, action, of, a, few, simple, principles, the, works, of, the, creator, ever, present, to, our, senses, give, a, living, and, perpetual, testimony, of, his, power, and, goodness, far, surpassing, any, evidence, transmitted, through, human, testimony, the, testimony, of, man, becomes, fainter, at, every, stage, of, transmission, whilst, each, new, inquiry, into, the, works, of, the, almighty, gives, to, us, more, exalted, views, of, his, wisdom, his, goodness, and, his, power, like, samuel, vince, babbage, also, wrote, a, defence, of, the, belief, in, divine, miracles, against, objections, previously, posed, by, david, hume, babbage, advocated, for, the, belief, of, divine, agency, stating, we, must, not, measure, the, credibility, or, incredibility, of, an, event, by, the, narrow, sphere, of, our, own, experience, nor, forget, that, there, is, a, divine, energy, which, overrides, what, we, familiarly, call, the, laws, of, nature, he, alluded, to, the, limits, of, human, experience, expressing, all, that, we, see, in, a, miracle, is, an, effect, which, is, new, to, our, observation, and, whose, cause, is, concealed, the, cause, may, be, beyond, the, sphere, of, our, observation, and, would, be, thus, beyond, the, familiar, sphere, of, nature, but, this, does, not, make, the, event, a, violation, of, any, law, of, nature, the, limits, of, man, s, observation, lie, within, very, narrow, boundaries, and, it, would, be, arrogance, to, suppose, that, the, reach, of, man, s, power, is, to, form, the, limits, of, the, natural, world, the, british, association, was, consciously, modelled, on, the, deutsche, naturforscher, versammlung, founded, in, 1822, it, rejected, romantic, science, as, well, as, metaphysics, and, started, to, entrench, the, divisions, of, science, from, literature, and, professionals, from, amateurs, belonging, as, he, did, to, the, wattite, faction, in, the, baas, represented, in, particular, by, james, watt, the, younger, babbage, identified, closely, with, industrialists, he, wanted, to, go, faster, in, the, same, directions, and, had, little, time, for, the, more, gentlemanly, component, of, its, membership, indeed, he, subscribed, to, a, version, of, conjectural, history, that, placed, industrial, society, as, the, culmination, of, human, development, and, shared, this, view, with, herschel, a, clash, with, roderick, murchison, led, in, 1838, to, his, withdrawal, from, further, involvement, at, the, end, of, the, same, year, he, sent, in, his, resignation, as, lucasian, professor, walking, away, also, from, the, cambridge, struggle, with, whewell, his, interests, became, more, focussed, on, computation, and, metrology, and, on, international, contacts, a, project, announced, by, babbage, was, to, tabulate, all, physical, constants, referred, to, as, constants, of, nature, a, phrase, in, itself, a, neologism, and, then, to, compile, an, encyclopaedic, work, of, numerical, information, he, was, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, absolute, measurement, his, ideas, followed, on, from, those, of, johann, christian, poggendorff, and, were, mentioned, to, brewster, in, 1832, there, were, to, be, 19, categories, of, constants, and, ian, hacking, sees, these, as, reflecting, in, part, babbage, s, eccentric, enthusiasms, babbage, s, paper, on, tables, of, the, constants, of, nature, and, art, was, reprinted, by, the, smithsonian, institution, in, 1856, with, an, added, note, that, the, physical, tables, of, arnold, henry, guyot, will, form, a, part, of, the, important, work, proposed, in, this, article, exact, measurement, was, also, key, to, the, development, of, machine, tools, here, again, babbage, is, considered, a, pioneer, with, henry, maudslay, william, sellers, and, joseph, whitworth, through, the, royal, society, babbage, acquired, the, friendship, of, the, engineer, marc, brunel, it, was, through, brunel, that, babbage, knew, of, joseph, clement, and, so, came, to, encounter, the, artisans, whom, he, observed, in, his, work, on, manufactures, babbage, provided, an, introduction, for, isambard, kingdom, brunel, in, 1830, for, a, contact, with, the, proposed, bristol, birmingham, railway, he, carried, out, studies, around, 1838, to, show, the, superiority, of, the, broad, gauge, for, railways, used, by, brunel, s, great, western, railway, in, 1838, babbage, invented, the, pilot, also, called, a, cow, catcher, the, metal, frame, attached, to, the, front, of, locomotives, that, clears, the, tracks, of, obstacles, he, also, constructed, a, dynamometer, car, his, eldest, son, benjamin, herschel, babbage, worked, as, an, engineer, for, brunel, on, the, railways, before, emigrating, to, australia, in, the, 1850s, babbage, also, invented, an, ophthalmoscope, which, he, gave, to, thomas, wharton, jones, for, testing, jones, however, ignored, it, the, device, only, came, into, use, after, being, independently, invented, by, hermann, von, helmholtz, babbage, achieved, notable, results, in, cryptography, though, this, was, still, not, known, a, century, after, his, death, letter, frequency, was, category, 18, of, babbage, s, tabulation, project, joseph, henry, later, defended, interest, in, it, in, the, absence, of, the, facts, as, relevant, to, the, management, of, movable, type, as, early, as, 1845, babbage, had, solved, a, cipher, that, had, been, posed, as, a, challenge, by, his, nephew, henry, hollier, and, in, the, process, he, made, a, discovery, about, ciphers, that, were, based, on, vigen, re, tables, specifically, he, realised, that, enciphering, plain, text, with, a, keyword, rendered, the, cipher, text, subject, to, modular, arithmetic, during, the, crimean, war, of, the, 1850s, babbage, broke, vigen, re, s, autokey, cipher, as, well, as, the, much, weaker, cipher, that, is, called, vigen, re, cipher, today, his, discovery, was, kept, a, military, secret, and, was, not, published, credit, for, the, result, was, instead, given, to, friedrich, kasiski, a, prussian, infantry, officer, who, made, the, same, discovery, some, years, later, however, in, 1854, babbage, published, the, solution, of, a, vigen, re, cipher, which, had, been, published, previously, in, the, journal, of, the, society, of, arts, in, 1855, babbage, also, published, a, short, letter, cypher, writing, in, the, same, journal, nevertheless, his, priority, was, not, established, until, 1985, babbage, involved, himself, in, well, publicised, but, unpopular, campaigns, against, public, nuisances, he, once, counted, all, the, broken, panes, of, glass, of, a, factory, publishing, in, 1857, a, table, of, the, relative, frequency, of, the, causes, of, breakage, of, plate, glass, windows, of, 464, broken, panes, 14, were, caused, by, drunken, men, women, or, boys, babbage, s, distaste, for, commoners, the, mob, included, writing, observations, of, street, nuisances, in, 1864, as, well, as, tallying, up, 165, nuisances, over, a, period, of, 80, days, he, especially, hated, street, music, and, in, particular, the, music, of, organ, grinders, against, whom, he, railed, in, various, venues, the, following, quotation, is, typical, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, misery, inflicted, upon, thousands, of, persons, and, the, absolute, pecuniary, penalty, imposed, upon, multitudes, of, intellectual, workers, by, the, loss, of, their, time, destroyed, by, organ, grinders, and, other, similar, nuisances, babbage, was, not, alone, in, his, campaign, a, convert, to, the, cause, was, the, mp, michael, thomas, bass, in, the, 1860s, babbage, also, took, up, the, anti, hoop, rolling, campaign, he, blamed, hoop, rolling, boys, for, driving, their, iron, hoops, under, horses, legs, with, the, result, that, the, rider, is, thrown, and, very, often, the, horse, breaks, a, leg, babbage, achieved, a, certain, notoriety, in, this, matter, being, denounced, in, debate, in, commons, in, 1864, for, commencing, a, crusade, against, the, popular, game, of, tip, cat, and, the, trundling, of, hoops, babbage, s, machines, were, among, the, first, mechanical, computers, that, they, were, not, actually, completed, was, largely, because, of, funding, problems, and, clashes, of, personality, most, notably, with, george, biddell, airy, the, astronomer, royal, babbage, directed, the, building, of, some, steam, powered, machines, that, achieved, some, modest, success, suggesting, that, calculations, could, be, mechanised, for, more, than, ten, years, he, received, government, funding, for, his, project, which, amounted, to, 17, 000, but, eventually, the, treasury, lost, confidence, in, him, while, babbage, s, machines, were, mechanical, and, unwieldy, their, basic, architecture, was, similar, to, that, of, a, modern, computer, the, data, and, program, memory, were, separated, operation, was, instruction, based, the, control, unit, could, make, conditional, jumps, and, the, machine, had, a, separate, i, o, unit, in, babbage, s, time, printed, mathematical, tables, were, calculated, by, human, computers, in, other, words, by, hand, they, were, central, to, navigation, science, and, engineering, as, well, as, mathematics, mistakes, were, known, to, occur, in, transcription, as, well, as, calculation, at, cambridge, babbage, saw, the, fallibility, of, this, process, and, the, opportunity, of, adding, mechanisation, into, its, management, his, own, account, of, his, path, towards, mechanical, computation, references, a, particular, occasion, in, 1812, he, was, sitting, in, his, rooms, in, the, analytical, society, looking, at, a, table, of, logarithms, which, he, knew, to, be, full, of, mistakes, when, the, idea, occurred, to, him, of, computing, all, tabular, functions, by, machinery, the, french, government, had, produced, several, tables, by, a, new, method, three, or, four, of, their, mathematicians, decided, how, to, compute, the, tables, half, a, dozen, more, broke, down, the, operations, into, simple, stages, and, the, work, itself, which, was, restricted, to, addition, and, subtraction, was, done, by, eighty, computers, who, knew, only, these, two, arithmetical, processes, here, for, the, first, time, mass, production, was, applied, to, arithmetic, and, babbage, was, seized, by, the, idea, that, the, labours, of, the, unskilled, computers, could, be, taken, over, completely, by, machinery, which, would, be, quicker, and, more, reliable, there, was, another, period, seven, years, later, when, his, interest, was, aroused, by, the, issues, around, computation, of, mathematical, tables, the, french, official, initiative, by, gaspard, de, prony, and, its, problems, of, implementation, were, familiar, to, him, after, the, napoleonic, wars, came, to, a, close, scientific, contacts, were, renewed, on, the, level, of, personal, contact, in, 1819, charles, blagden, was, in, paris, looking, into, the, printing, of, the, stalled, de, prony, project, and, lobbying, for, the, support, of, the, royal, society, in, works, of, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, babbage, referred, in, detail, to, de, prony, s, project, babbage, began, in, 1822, with, what, he, called, the, difference, engine, made, to, compute, values, of, polynomial, functions, it, was, created, to, calculate, a, series, of, values, automatically, by, using, the, method, of, finite, differences, it, was, possible, to, avoid, the, need, for, multiplication, and, division, for, a, prototype, difference, engine, babbage, brought, in, joseph, clement, to, implement, the, design, in, 1823, clement, worked, to, high, standards, but, his, machine, tools, were, particularly, elaborate, under, the, standard, terms, of, business, of, the, time, he, could, charge, for, their, construction, and, would, also, own, them, he, and, babbage, fell, out, over, costs, around, 1831, some, parts, of, the, prototype, survive, in, the, museum, of, the, history, of, science, oxford, this, prototype, evolved, into, the, first, difference, engine, it, remained, unfinished, and, the, finished, portion, is, located, at, the, science, museum, in, london, this, first, difference, engine, would, have, been, composed, of, around, 25, 000, parts, weighed, fifteen, short, tons, 13, 600, kg, and, would, have, been, 8, ft, 2, 4, m, tall, although, babbage, received, ample, funding, for, the, project, it, was, never, completed, he, later, 1847, 1849, produced, detailed, drawings, for, an, improved, version, difference, engine, no, 2, but, did, not, receive, funding, from, the, british, government, his, design, was, finally, constructed, in, 1989, 1991, using, his, plans, and, 19th, century, manufacturing, tolerances, it, performed, its, first, calculation, at, the, science, museum, london, returning, results, to, 31, digits, nine, years, later, in, 2000, the, science, museum, completed, the, printer, babbage, had, designed, for, the, difference, engine, the, science, museum, has, constructed, two, difference, engines, according, to, babbage, s, plans, for, the, difference, engine, no, 2, one, is, owned, by, the, museum, the, other, owned, by, the, technology, multimillionaire, nathan, myhrvold, went, on, exhibition, at, the, computer, history, museum, in, mountain, view, california, on, 10, may, 2008, the, two, models, that, have, been, constructed, are, not, replicas, after, the, attempt, at, making, the, first, difference, engine, fell, through, babbage, worked, to, design, a, more, complex, machine, called, the, analytical, engine, he, hired, c, g, jarvis, who, had, previously, worked, for, clement, as, a, draughtsman, the, analytical, engine, marks, the, transition, from, mechanised, arithmetic, to, fully, fledged, general, purpose, computation, it, is, largely, on, it, that, babbage, s, standing, as, computer, pioneer, rests, the, major, innovation, was, that, the, analytical, engine, was, to, be, programmed, using, punched, cards, the, engine, was, intended, to, use, loops, of, jacquard, s, punched, cards, to, control, a, mechanical, calculator, which, could, use, as, input, the, results, of, preceding, computations, the, machine, was, also, intended, to, employ, several, features, subsequently, used, in, modern, computers, including, sequential, control, branching, and, looping, it, would, have, been, the, first, mechanical, device, to, be, in, principle, turing, complete, charles, babbage, wrote, a, series, of, programs, for, the, analytical, engine, from, 1837, to, 1840, the, first, program, was, finished, in, 1837, the, engine, was, not, a, single, physical, machine, but, rather, a, succession, of, designs, that, babbage, tinkered, with, until, his, death, in, 1871, ada, lovelace, who, corresponded, with, babbage, during, his, development, of, the, analytical, engine, is, credited, with, developing, an, algorithm, that, would, enable, the, engine, to, calculate, a, sequence, of, bernoulli, numbers, despite, documentary, evidence, in, lovelace, s, own, handwriting, some, scholars, dispute, to, what, extent, the, ideas, were, lovelace, s, own, for, this, achievement, she, is, often, described, as, the, first, computer, programmer, though, no, programming, language, had, yet, been, invented, lovelace, also, translated, and, wrote, literature, supporting, the, project, describing, the, engine, s, programming, by, punch, cards, she, wrote, we, may, say, most, aptly, that, the, analytical, engine, weaves, algebraical, patterns, just, as, the, jacquard, loom, weaves, flowers, and, leaves, babbage, visited, turin, in, 1840, at, the, invitation, of, giovanni, plana, who, had, developed, in, 1831, an, analog, computing, machine, that, served, as, a, perpetual, calendar, here, in, 1840, in, turin, babbage, gave, the, only, public, explanation, and, lectures, about, the, analytical, engine, in, 1842, charles, wheatstone, approached, lovelace, to, translate, a, paper, of, luigi, menabrea, who, had, taken, notes, of, babbage, s, turin, talks, and, babbage, asked, her, to, add, something, of, her, own, fortunato, prandi, who, acted, as, interpreter, in, turin, was, an, italian, exile, and, follower, of, giuseppe, mazzini, per, georg, scheutz, wrote, about, the, difference, engine, in, 1830, and, experimented, in, automated, computation, after, 1834, and, lardner, s, edinburgh, review, article, he, set, up, a, project, of, his, own, doubting, whether, babbage, s, initial, plan, could, be, carried, out, this, he, pushed, through, with, his, son, edvard, scheutz, another, swedish, engine, was, that, of, martin, wiberg, 1860, in, 2011, researchers, in, britain, proposed, a, multimillion, pound, project, plan, 28, to, construct, babbage, s, analytical, engine, since, babbage, s, plans, were, continually, being, refined, and, were, never, completed, they, intended, to, engage, the, public, in, the, project, and, crowd, source, the, analysis, of, what, should, be, built, it, would, have, the, equivalent, of, 675, bytes, of, memory, and, run, at, a, clock, speed, of, about, 7, hz, they, hoped, to, complete, it, by, the, 150th, anniversary, of, babbage, s, death, in, 2021, advances, in, mems, and, nanotechnology, have, led, to, recent, high, tech, experiments, in, mechanical, computation, the, benefits, suggested, include, operation, in, high, radiation, or, high, temperature, environments, these, modern, versions, of, mechanical, computation, were, highlighted, in, the, economist, in, its, special, end, of, the, millennium, black, cover, issue, in, an, article, entitled, babbage, s, last, laugh, due, to, his, association, with, the, town, babbage, was, chosen, in, 2007, to, appear, on, the, 5, totnes, pound, note, an, image, of, babbage, features, in, the, british, cultural, icons, section, of, the, newly, designed, british, passport, in, 2015, on, 25, july, 1814, babbage, married, georgiana, whitmore, sister, of, british, parliamentarian, william, wolryche, whitmore, at, st, michael, s, church, in, teignmouth, devon, the, couple, lived, at, dudmaston, hall, shropshire, where, babbage, engineered, the, central, heating, system, before, moving, to, 5, devonshire, street, london, in, 1815, charles, and, georgiana, had, eight, children, but, only, four, benjamin, herschel, georgiana, whitmore, dugald, bromhead, and, henry, prevost, survived, childhood, charles, wife, georgiana, died, in, worcester, on, 1, september, 1827, the, same, year, as, his, father, their, second, son, also, named, charles, and, their, newborn, son, alexander, his, youngest, surviving, son, henry, prevost, babbage, 1824, 1918, went, on, to, create, six, small, demonstration, pieces, for, difference, engine, no, 1, based, on, his, father, s, designs, one, of, which, was, sent, to, harvard, university, where, it, was, later, discovered, by, howard, h, aiken, pioneer, of, the, harvard, mark, i, henry, prevost, s, 1910, analytical, engine, mill, previously, on, display, at, dudmaston, hall, is, now, on, display, at, the, science, museum, babbage, lived, and, worked, for, over, 40, years, at, 1, dorset, street, marylebone, where, he, died, at, the, age, of, 79, on, 18, october, 1871, he, was, buried, in, london, s, kensal, green, cemetery, according, to, horsley, babbage, died, of, renal, inadequacy, secondary, to, cystitis, he, had, declined, both, a, knighthood, and, baronetcy, he, also, argued, against, hereditary, peerages, favouring, life, peerages, instead, in, 1983, the, autopsy, report, for, charles, babbage, was, discovered, and, later, published, by, his, great, great, grandson, a, copy, of, the, original, is, also, available, half, of, babbage, s, brain, is, preserved, at, the, hunterian, museum, in, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, in, london, the, other, half, of, babbage, s, brain, is, on, display, in, the, science, museum, london, there, is, a, black, plaque, commemorating, the, 40, years, babbage, spent, at, 1, dorset, street, london, locations, institutions, and, other, things, named, after, babbage, include, babbage, frequently, appears, in, steampunk, works, he, has, been, called, an, iconic, figure, of, the, genre, other, works, in, which, babbage, appears, include
