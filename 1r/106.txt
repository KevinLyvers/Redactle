artists, clergy, monarchs, popes, tiziano, vecellio, italian, c, 1488, 90, 27, august, 1576, latinized, as, titianus, hence, known, in, english, as, titian, t, n, tish, n, was, an, italian, renaissance, painter, the, most, important, artist, of, renaissance, venetian, painting, he, was, born, in, pieve, di, cadore, near, belluno, during, his, lifetime, he, was, often, called, da, cadore, from, cadore, taken, from, his, native, region, recognized, by, his, contemporaries, as, the, sun, amidst, small, stars, recalling, the, final, line, of, dante, s, paradiso, titian, was, one, of, the, most, versatile, of, italian, painters, equally, adept, with, portraits, landscape, backgrounds, and, mythological, and, religious, subjects, his, painting, methods, particularly, in, the, application, and, use, of, colour, exerted, a, profound, influence, not, only, on, painters, of, the, late, italian, renaissance, but, on, future, generations, of, western, artists, his, career, was, successful, from, the, start, and, he, became, sought, after, by, patrons, initially, from, venice, and, its, possessions, then, joined, by, the, north, italian, princes, and, finally, the, habsburgs, and, papacy, along, with, giorgione, he, is, considered, a, founder, of, the, venetian, school, of, italian, renaissance, painting, during, his, long, life, titian, s, artistic, manner, changed, drastically, but, he, retained, a, lifelong, interest, in, colour, although, his, mature, works, may, not, contain, the, vivid, luminous, tints, of, his, early, pieces, they, are, renowned, for, their, loose, brushwork, and, subtlety, of, tone, the, exact, time, or, date, of, titian, s, birth, is, uncertain, when, he, was, an, old, man, he, claimed, in, a, letter, to, philip, ii, king, of, spain, to, have, been, born, in, 1474, but, this, seems, most, unlikely, other, writers, contemporary, to, his, old, age, give, figures, that, would, equate, to, birth, dates, between, 1473, and, after, 1482, most, modern, scholars, believe, a, date, between, 1488, and, 1490, is, more, likely, though, his, age, at, death, being, 99, had, been, accepted, into, the, 20th, century, he, was, the, son, of, gregorio, vecellio, and, his, wife, lucia, of, whom, little, is, known, gregorio, was, superintendent, of, the, castle, of, pieve, di, cadore, and, managed, local, mines, for, their, owners, gregorio, was, also, a, distinguished, councilor, and, soldier, many, relatives, including, titian, s, grandfather, were, notaries, and, the, family, was, well, established, in, the, area, which, was, ruled, by, venice, at, the, age, of, about, ten, to, twelve, titian, and, his, brother, francesco, who, perhaps, followed, later, were, sent, to, an, uncle, in, venice, to, find, an, apprenticeship, with, a, painter, the, minor, painter, sebastian, zuccato, whose, sons, became, well, known, mosaicists, and, who, may, have, been, a, family, friend, arranged, for, the, brothers, to, enter, the, studio, of, the, elderly, gentile, bellini, from, which, they, later, transferred, to, that, of, his, brother, giovanni, bellini, at, that, time, the, bellinis, especially, giovanni, were, the, leading, artists, in, the, city, there, titian, found, a, group, of, young, men, about, his, own, age, among, them, giovanni, palma, da, serinalta, lorenzo, lotto, sebastiano, luciani, and, giorgio, da, castelfranco, nicknamed, giorgione, francesco, vecellio, titian, s, older, brother, later, became, a, painter, of, some, note, in, venice, a, fresco, of, hercules, on, the, morosini, palace, is, said, to, have, been, one, of, titian, s, earliest, works, others, were, the, bellini, esque, so, called, gypsy, madonna, in, vienna, and, the, visitation, of, mary, and, elizabeth, from, the, convent, of, sant, andrea, now, in, the, accademia, venice, a, man, with, a, quilted, sleeve, is, an, early, portrait, painted, around, 1509, and, described, by, giorgio, vasari, in, 1568, scholars, long, believed, it, depicted, ludovico, ariosto, but, now, think, it, is, of, gerolamo, barbarigo, rembrandt, borrowed, the, composition, for, his, self, portraits, titian, joined, giorgione, as, an, assistant, but, many, contemporary, critics, already, found, titian, s, work, more, impressive, for, example, in, exterior, frescoes, now, almost, totally, destroyed, that, they, collaborated, on, for, the, fondaco, dei, tedeschi, state, warehouse, for, the, german, merchants, their, relationship, evidently, contained, a, significant, element, of, rivalry, distinguishing, between, their, work, during, this, period, remains, a, subject, of, scholarly, controversy, a, substantial, number, of, attributions, have, moved, from, giorgione, to, titian, in, the, 20th, century, with, little, traffic, the, other, way, one, of, the, earliest, known, titian, works, christ, carrying, the, cross, in, the, scuola, grande, di, san, rocco, depicting, the, ecce, homo, scene, was, long, regarded, as, by, giorgione, the, two, young, masters, were, likewise, recognized, as, the, leaders, of, their, new, school, of, arte, moderna, which, is, characterized, by, paintings, made, more, flexible, freed, from, symmetry, and, the, remnants, of, hieratic, conventions, still, found, in, the, works, of, giovanni, bellini, in, 1507, 1508, giorgione, was, commissioned, by, the, state, to, create, frescoes, on, the, re, erected, fondaco, dei, tedeschi, titian, and, morto, da, feltre, worked, along, with, him, and, some, fragments, of, paintings, remain, probably, by, giorgione, some, of, their, work, is, known, in, part, through, the, engravings, of, fontana, after, giorgione, s, early, death, in, 1510, titian, continued, to, paint, giorgionesque, subjects, for, some, time, though, his, style, developed, its, own, features, including, bold, and, expressive, brushwork, titian, s, talent, in, fresco, is, shown, in, those, he, painted, in, 1511, at, padua, in, the, carmelite, church, and, in, the, scuola, del, santo, some, of, which, have, been, preserved, among, them, the, meeting, at, the, golden, gate, and, three, scenes, miracoli, di, sant, antonio, from, the, life, of, st, anthony, of, padua, the, miracle, of, the, jealous, husband, which, depicts, the, murder, of, a, young, woman, by, her, husband, a, child, testifying, to, its, mother, s, innocence, and, the, saint, healing, the, young, man, with, a, broken, limb, the, resurrected, christ, uffizi, also, dates, to, 1511, 1512, in, 1512, titian, returned, to, venice, from, padua, in, 1513, he, obtained, la, senseria, a, profitable, privilege, much, coveted, by, artists, in, the, fondaco, dei, tedeschi, he, became, superintendent, of, the, government, works, especially, charged, with, completing, the, paintings, left, unfinished, by, giovanni, bellini, in, the, hall, of, the, great, council, in, the, ducal, palace, he, set, up, an, atelier, on, the, grand, canal, at, s, samuele, the, precise, site, being, now, unknown, it, was, not, until, 1516, after, the, death, of, giovanni, bellini, that, he, came, into, actual, enjoyment, of, his, patent, at, the, same, time, he, entered, an, exclusive, arrangement, for, painting, the, patent, yielded, him, a, good, annuity, of, 20, crowns, and, exempted, him, from, certain, taxes, in, return, he, was, bound, to, paint, likenesses, of, the, successive, doges, of, his, time, at, the, fixed, price, of, eight, crowns, each, the, actual, number, he, painted, was, five, during, this, period, 1516, 1530, which, may, be, called, the, period, of, his, mastery, and, maturity, the, artist, moved, on, from, his, early, giorgionesque, style, undertook, larger, more, complex, subjects, and, for, the, first, time, attempted, a, monumental, style, giorgione, died, in, 1510, and, giovanni, bellini, in, 1516, leaving, titian, unrivaled, in, the, venetian, school, for, sixty, years, he, was, the, undisputed, master, of, venetian, painting, in, 1516, he, completed, his, famous, masterpiece, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, for, the, high, altar, of, the, basilica, di, santa, maria, gloriosa, dei, frari, where, it, is, still, in, situ, this, piece, of, colourism, executed, on, a, grand, scale, rarely, before, seen, in, italy, created, a, sensation, the, signoria, took, note, and, observed, that, titian, was, neglecting, his, work, in, the, hall, of, the, great, council, but, in, 1516, he, succeeded, his, master, giovanni, bellini, in, receiving, a, pension, from, the, senate, furthermore, he, painted, the, similar, painting, of, assumption, of, the, virgin, above, the, altar, in, dubrovnik, cathedral, in, ragusa, now, croatia, the, pictorial, structure, of, the, assumption, that, of, uniting, in, the, same, composition, two, or, three, scenes, superimposed, on, different, levels, earth, and, heaven, the, temporal, and, the, infinite, was, continued, in, a, series, of, works, such, as, the, retable, of, san, domenico, at, ancona, 1520, the, retable, of, brescia, 1522, and, the, retable, of, san, niccol, 1523, in, the, vatican, museums, each, time, attaining, to, a, higher, and, more, perfect, conception, he, finally, reached, a, classic, formula, in, the, pesaro, madonna, better, known, as, the, madonna, di, ca, pesaro, c, 1519, 1526, also, for, the, frari, church, this, is, perhaps, his, most, studied, work, whose, patiently, developed, plan, is, set, forth, with, supreme, display, of, order, and, freedom, originality, and, style, here, titian, gave, a, new, conception, of, the, traditional, groups, of, donors, and, holy, persons, moving, in, aerial, space, the, plans, and, different, degrees, set, in, an, architectural, framework, titian, was, then, at, the, height, of, his, fame, and, towards, 1521, following, the, production, of, a, figure, of, st, sebastian, for, the, papal, legate, in, brescia, of, which, there, are, numerous, replicas, purchasers, pressed, for, his, work, to, this, period, belongs, a, more, extraordinary, work, the, assassination, of, saint, peter, martyr, 1530, formerly, in, the, dominican, church, of, san, zanipolo, and, destroyed, by, an, austrian, shell, in, 1867, only, copies, and, engravings, of, this, proto, baroque, picture, remain, it, combined, extreme, violence, and, a, landscape, mostly, consisting, of, a, great, tree, that, pressed, into, the, scene, and, seems, to, accentuate, the, drama, in, a, way, that, looks, forward, to, the, baroque, the, artist, simultaneously, continued, a, series, of, small, madonnas, which, he, placed, amid, beautiful, landscapes, in, the, manner, of, genre, pictures, or, poetic, pastorals, the, virgin, with, the, rabbit, in, the, louvre, is, the, finished, type, of, these, pictures, another, work, of, the, same, period, also, in, the, louvre, is, the, entombment, this, was, also, the, period, of, the, three, large, and, famous, mythological, scenes, for, the, camerino, of, alfonso, d, este, in, ferrara, the, bacchanal, of, the, andrians, and, the, worship, of, venus, in, the, museo, del, prado, and, the, bacchus, and, ariadne, 1520, 23, in, london, perhaps, the, most, brilliant, productions, of, the, neo, pagan, culture, or, alexandrianism, of, the, renaissance, many, times, imitated, but, never, surpassed, even, by, rubens, himself, finally, this, was, the, period, when, titian, composed, the, half, length, figures, and, busts, of, young, women, such, as, flora, in, the, uffizi, and, woman, with, a, mirror, in, the, louvre, at, least, according, to, popular, legend, they, were, modeled, by, some, of, venice, s, famous, courtesans, titian, s, skill, with, colour, is, exemplified, by, his, dana, one, of, several, mythological, paintings, or, poesie, poems, as, the, painter, called, them, this, painting, was, done, for, alessandro, farnese, but, a, later, variant, was, produced, for, philip, ii, for, whom, titian, painted, many, of, his, most, important, mythological, paintings, although, michelangelo, adjudged, this, piece, deficient, from, the, point, of, view, of, drawing, titian, and, his, studio, produced, several, versions, for, other, patrons, another, famous, painting, is, bacchus, and, ariadne, depicting, theseus, whose, ship, is, shown, in, the, distance, and, who, has, just, left, ariadne, at, naxos, when, bacchus, arrives, jumping, from, his, chariot, drawn, by, two, cheetahs, and, falling, immediately, in, love, with, ariadne, bacchus, raised, her, to, heaven, her, constellation, is, shown, in, the, sky, the, painting, belongs, to, a, series, commissioned, from, bellini, titian, and, dosso, dossi, for, the, camerino, d, alabastro, alabaster, room, in, the, ducal, palace, ferrara, by, alfonso, i, d, este, duke, of, ferrara, who, in, 1510, even, tried, to, commission, michelangelo, and, raphael, during, the, next, period, 1530, 1550, titian, developed, the, style, introduced, by, his, dramatic, death, of, st, peter, martyr, in, 1538, the, venetian, government, dissatisfied, with, titian, s, neglect, of, his, work, for, the, ducal, palace, ordered, him, to, refund, the, money, he, had, received, and, il, pordenone, his, rival, of, recent, years, was, installed, in, his, place, however, at, the, end, of, a, year, pordenone, died, and, titian, who, meanwhile, applied, himself, diligently, to, painting, in, the, hall, the, battle, of, cadore, was, reinstated, this, major, battle, scene, was, lost, with, many, other, major, works, by, venetian, artists, in, the, 1577, fire, that, destroyed, all, the, old, pictures, in, the, great, chambers, of, the, doge, s, palace, it, depicted, in, life, size, the, moment, when, the, venetian, general, d, alviano, attacked, the, enemy, with, horses, and, men, crashing, down, into, a, stream, it, was, titian, s, most, important, attempt, at, a, tumultuous, and, heroic, scene, of, movement, to, rival, raphael, s, battle, of, constantine, michelangelo, s, equally, ill, fated, battle, of, cascina, and, leonardo, da, vinci, s, the, battle, of, anghiari, these, last, two, unfinished, there, remains, only, a, poor, incomplete, copy, at, the, uffizi, and, a, mediocre, engraving, by, fontana, the, speech, of, the, marquis, del, vasto, madrid, 1541, was, also, partly, destroyed, by, fire, but, this, period, of, the, master, s, work, is, still, represented, by, the, presentation, of, the, blessed, virgin, venice, 1539, one, of, his, most, popular, canvasses, and, by, the, ecce, homo, vienna, 1541, despite, its, loss, the, painting, had, a, great, influence, on, bolognese, art, and, rubens, both, in, the, handling, of, details, and, the, general, effect, of, horses, soldiers, lictors, powerful, stirrings, of, crowds, at, the, foot, of, a, stairway, lit, by, torches, with, the, flapping, of, banners, against, the, sky, less, successful, were, the, pendentives, of, the, cupola, at, santa, maria, della, salute, death, of, abel, sacrifice, of, abraham, david, and, goliath, these, violent, scenes, viewed, in, perspective, from, below, were, by, their, very, nature, in, unfavourable, situations, they, were, nevertheless, much, admired, and, imitated, rubens, among, others, applying, this, system, to, his, forty, ceilings, the, sketches, only, remain, of, the, jesuit, church, at, antwerp, at, this, time, also, during, his, visit, to, rome, the, artist, began, a, series, of, reclining, venuses, the, venus, of, urbino, of, the, uffizi, venus, and, love, at, the, same, museum, venus, and, the, organ, player, madrid, which, shows, the, influence, of, contact, with, ancient, sculpture, giorgione, had, already, dealt, with, the, subject, in, his, dresden, picture, finished, by, titian, but, here, a, purple, drapery, substituted, for, a, landscape, background, changed, by, its, harmonious, colouring, the, whole, meaning, of, the, scene, from, the, beginning, of, his, career, titian, was, a, masterful, portrait, painter, in, works, like, la, bella, eleanora, de, gonzaga, duchess, of, urbino, at, the, pitti, palace, he, painted, the, likenesses, of, princes, or, doges, cardinals, or, monks, and, artists, or, writers, no, other, painter, was, so, successful, in, extracting, from, each, physiognomy, so, many, traits, at, once, characteristic, and, beautiful, among, portrait, painters, titian, is, compared, to, rembrandt, and, vel, zquez, with, the, interior, life, of, the, former, and, the, clearness, certainty, and, obviousness, of, the, latter, these, qualities, show, in, the, portrait, of, pope, paul, iii, of, naples, or, the, sketch, of, the, same, pope, paul, iii, and, his, grandsons, the, portrait, of, pietro, aretino, of, the, pitti, palace, the, portrait, of, isabella, of, portugal, madrid, and, the, series, of, emperor, charles, v, of, the, same, museum, the, charles, v, with, a, greyhound, 1533, and, especially, the, equestrian, portrait, of, charles, v, 1548, an, equestrian, picture, in, a, symphony, of, purples, this, state, portrait, of, charles, v, 1548, at, the, battle, of, m, hlberg, established, a, new, genre, that, of, the, grand, equestrian, portrait, the, composition, is, steeped, both, in, the, roman, tradition, of, equestrian, sculpture, and, in, the, medieval, representations, of, an, ideal, christian, knight, but, the, weary, figure, and, face, have, a, subtlety, few, such, representations, attempt, in, 1532, after, painting, a, portrait, of, the, emperor, charles, v, in, bologna, he, was, made, a, count, palatine, and, knight, of, the, golden, spur, his, children, were, also, made, nobles, of, the, empire, which, for, a, painter, was, an, exceptional, honor, this, appointment, allowed, him, to, gain, royal, patronage, and, work, on, prestigious, commissions, as, a, matter, of, professional, and, worldly, success, his, position, from, about, this, time, is, regarded, as, equal, only, to, that, of, raphael, michelangelo, and, at, a, later, date, rubens, in, 1540, he, received, a, pension, from, d, avalos, marquis, del, vasto, and, an, annuity, of, 200, crowns, which, was, afterwards, doubled, from, charles, v, from, the, treasury, of, milan, another, source, of, profit, for, he, was, always, aware, of, money, was, a, contract, obtained, in, 1542, for, supplying, grain, to, cadore, where, he, visited, almost, every, year, and, where, he, was, both, generous, and, influential, titian, had, a, favourite, villa, on, the, neighboring, manza, hill, in, front, of, the, church, of, castello, roganzuolo, from, which, it, may, be, inferred, he, made, his, chief, observations, of, landscape, form, and, effect, the, so, called, titian, s, mill, constantly, discernible, in, his, studies, is, at, collontola, near, belluno, he, visited, rome, in, 1546, and, obtained, the, freedom, of, the, city, his, immediate, predecessor, in, that, honor, having, been, michelangelo, in, 1537, he, could, at, the, same, time, have, succeeded, the, painter, sebastiano, del, piombo, in, his, lucrative, office, as, holder, of, the, piombo, or, papal, seal, and, he, was, prepared, to, take, holy, orders, for, the, purpose, but, the, project, lapsed, through, his, being, summoned, away, from, venice, in, 1547, to, paint, charles, v, and, others, in, augsburg, he, was, there, again, in, 1550, and, executed, the, portrait, of, philip, ii, which, was, sent, to, england, and, was, useful, in, philip, s, suit, for, the, hand, of, queen, mary, during, the, last, twenty, six, years, of, his, life, 1550, 1576, titian, worked, mainly, for, philip, ii, and, as, a, portrait, painter, he, became, more, self, critical, an, insatiable, perfectionist, keeping, some, pictures, in, his, studio, for, ten, years, returning, to, them, and, retouching, them, constantly, adding, new, expressions, at, once, more, refined, concise, and, subtle, he, also, finished, many, copies, that, his, pupils, made, of, his, earlier, works, this, caused, problems, of, attribution, and, priority, among, versions, of, his, works, which, were, also, widely, copied, and, faked, outside, his, studio, during, his, lifetime, and, afterwards, for, philip, ii, he, painted, a, series, of, large, mythological, paintings, known, as, the, poesie, mostly, from, ovid, which, scholars, regard, as, among, his, greatest, works, thanks, to, the, prudishness, of, philip, s, successors, these, were, later, mostly, given, as, gifts, and, only, two, remain, in, the, prado, titian, was, producing, religious, works, for, philip, at, the, same, time, some, of, which, the, ones, inside, ribeira, palace, are, known, to, have, been, destroyed, during, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, the, poesie, series, contained, the, following, works, the, poesie, except, for, the, death, of, actaeon, were, brought, together, for, the, first, time, in, nearly, 500, years, in, an, exhibition, in, 2020, and, 2021, that, travelled, from, the, national, gallery, in, london, to, the, museo, del, prado, in, madrid, to, the, isabella, stewart, gardner, museum, in, boston, where, it, closed, on, january, 2, 2022, another, painting, that, apparently, remained, in, his, studio, at, his, death, and, has, been, much, less, well, known, until, recent, decades, is, the, powerful, even, repellent, flaying, of, marsyas, krom, czech, republic, another, violent, masterpiece, is, tarquin, and, lucretia, cambridge, fitzwilliam, museum, for, each, problem, he, undertook, he, furnished, a, new, and, more, perfect, formula, he, never, again, equaled, the, emotion, and, tragedy, of, the, crowning, with, thorns, louvre, in, the, expression, of, the, mysterious, and, the, divine, he, never, equaled, the, poetry, of, the, pilgrims, of, emmaus, while, in, superb, and, heroic, brilliancy, he, never, again, executed, anything, more, grand, than, the, doge, grimani, adoring, faith, venice, doge, s, palace, or, the, trinity, of, madrid, on, the, other, hand, from, the, standpoint, of, flesh, tints, his, most, moving, pictures, are, those, of, his, old, age, such, as, the, poesie, and, the, antiope, of, the, louvre, he, even, attempted, problems, of, chiaroscuro, in, fantastic, night, effects, martyrdom, of, st, laurence, church, of, the, jesuits, venice, st, jerome, louvre, crucifixion, church, of, san, domenico, ancona, titian, had, engaged, his, daughter, lavinia, the, beautiful, girl, whom, he, loved, deeply, and, painted, various, times, to, cornelio, sarcinelli, of, serravalle, she, had, succeeded, her, aunt, orsa, then, deceased, as, the, manager, of, the, household, which, with, the, lordly, income, that, titian, made, by, this, time, placed, her, on, a, corresponding, footing, lavinia, s, marriage, to, cornelio, took, place, in, 1554, she, died, in, childbirth, in, 1560, titian, was, at, the, council, of, trent, towards, 1555, of, which, there, is, a, finished, sketch, in, the, louvre, his, friend, aretino, died, suddenly, in, 1556, and, another, close, intimate, the, sculptor, and, architect, jacopo, sansovino, in, 1570, in, september, 1565, titian, went, to, cadore, and, designed, the, decorations, for, the, church, at, pieve, partly, executed, by, his, pupils, one, of, these, is, a, transfiguration, another, an, annunciation, now, in, san, salvatore, venice, inscribed, titianus, fecit, by, way, of, protest, it, is, said, against, the, disparagement, of, some, persons, who, caviled, at, the, veteran, s, failing, handicraft, around, 1560, titian, painted, the, oil, on, canvas, madonna, and, child, with, saints, luke, and, catherine, of, alexandria, a, derivative, on, the, motif, of, madonna, and, child, it, is, suggested, that, members, of, titian, s, venice, workshop, probably, painted, the, curtain, and, luke, because, of, the, lower, quality, of, those, parts, he, continued, to, accept, commissions, to, the, end, of, his, life, like, many, of, his, late, works, titian, s, last, painting, the, piet, is, a, dramatic, nocturnal, scene, of, suffering, he, apparently, intended, it, for, his, own, tomb, chapel, he, had, selected, as, his, burial, place, the, chapel, of, the, crucifix, in, the, basilica, di, santa, maria, gloriosa, dei, frari, the, church, of, the, franciscan, order, in, payment, for, a, grave, he, offered, the, franciscans, a, picture, of, the, piet, that, represented, himself, and, his, son, orazio, with, a, sibyl, before, the, savior, he, nearly, finished, this, work, but, differences, arose, regarding, it, and, he, settled, on, being, interred, in, his, native, pieve, while, the, plague, raged, in, venice, titian, died, on, 27, august, 1576, depending, on, his, unknown, birthdate, see, above, he, was, somewhere, from, his, late, eighties,

large, monument, still, in, the, church, very, shortly, after, titian, s, death, his, son, assistant, and, sole, heir, orazio, also, died, of, the, plague, greatly, complicating, the, settlement, of, his, estate, as, he, had, made, no, will, titian, never, attempted, engraving, but, he, was, very, conscious, of, the, importance, of, printmaking, as, a, means, to, expand, his, reputation, in, the, period, 1515, 1520, he, designed, a, number, of, woodcuts, including, an, enormous, and, impressive, one, of, the, drowning, of, pharaoh, s, army, in, the, red, sea, in, twelve, blocks, intended, as, wall, decoration, as, a, substitute, for, paintings, and, collaborated, with, domenico, campagnola, and, others, who, produced, additional, prints, based, on, his, paintings, and, drawings, much, later, he, provided, drawings, based, on, his, paintings, to, cornelis, cort, from, the, netherlands, who, engraved, them, martino, rota, followed, cort, from, about, 1558, to, 1568, titian, employed, an, extensive, array, of, pigments, and, it, can, be, said, that, he, availed, himself, of, virtually, all, available, pigments, of, his, time, in, addition, to, the, common, pigments, of, the, renaissance, period, such, as, ultramarine, vermilion, lead, tin, yellow, ochres, and, azurite, he, also, used, the, rare, pigments, realgar, and, orpiment, titian, s, wife, cecilia, was, a, barber, s, daughter, from, his, hometown, village, of, cadore, as, a, young, woman, she, had, been, his, housekeeper, and, mistress, for, some, five, years, cecilia, had, already, borne, titian, two, fine, sons, pomponio, and, orazio, when, in, 1525, she, fell, seriously, ill, titian, wishing, to, legitimize, the, children, married, her, cecilia, recovered, the, marriage, was, a, happy, one, and, they, had, another, daughter, who, died, in, infancy, in, august, 1530, cecilia, died, titian, remarried, but, little, information, is, known, about, his, second, wife, she, was, possibly, the, mother, of, his, daughter, lavinia, titian, had, a, fourth, child, emilia, the, result, of, an, affair, possibly, with, a, housekeeper, his, favourite, child, was, orazio, who, became, his, assistant, in, august, 1530, titian, moved, his, two, sons, and, infant, daughter, to, a, new, home, and, convinced, his, sister, orsa, to, come, from, cadore, and, take, charge, of, the, household, the, mansion, difficult, to, find, now, is, in, the, biri, grande, then, a, fashionable, suburb, at, the, extreme, end, of, venice, on, the, sea, with, beautiful, gardens, and, a, view, towards, murano, in, about, 1526, he, had, become, acquainted, and, soon, close, friends, with, pietro, aretino, the, influential, and, audacious, figure, who, features, so, strangely, in, the, chronicles, of, the, time, titian, sent, a, portrait, of, him, to, gonzaga, duke, of, mantua, when, he, was, very, young, the, famed, italian, painter, tintoretto, was, brought, to, titian, s, studio, by, his, father, this, was, supposedly, around, 1533, when, titian, was, according, to, the, ordinary, accounts, over, 40, years, of, age, tintoretto, had, only, been, ten, days, in, the, studio, when, titian, sent, him, home, for, good, because, the, great, master, observed, some, very, spirited, drawings, which, he, learned, to, be, the, production, of, tintoretto, it, is, inferred, that, he, became, at, once, jealous, of, so, promising, a, student, this, however, is, mere, conjecture, and, perhaps, it, may, be, fairer, to, suppose, that, the, drawings, exhibited, so, much, independence, of, manner, that, titian, judged, that, young, jacopo, although, he, might, become, a, painter, would, never, be, properly, a, pupil, from, this, time, forward, the, two, always, remained, upon, distant, terms, though, tintoretto, being, indeed, a, professed, and, ardent, admirer, of, titian, but, never, a, friend, and, titian, and, his, adherents, turned, a, cold, shoulder, to, him, there, was, also, active, disparagement, but, it, passed, unnoticed, by, tintoretto, several, other, artists, of, the, vecelli, family, followed, in, the, wake, of, titian, francesco, vecellio, his, older, brother, was, introduced, to, painting, by, titian, it, is, said, at, the, age, of, twelve, but, chronology, will, hardly, admit, of, this, and, painted, in, the, church, of, s, vito, in, cadore, a, picture, of, the, titular, saint, armed, this, was, a, noteworthy, performance, of, which, titian, the, usual, story, became, jealous, so, francesco, was, diverted, from, painting, to, soldiering, and, afterwards, to, mercantile, life, marco, vecellio, called, marco, di, tiziano, born, in, 1545, was, titian, s, nephew, and, was, constantly, with, the, master, in, his, old, age, and, learned, his, methods, of, work, he, has, left, some, able, productions, in, the, ducal, palace, the, meeting, of, charles, v, and, clement, vii, in, 1529, in, san, giacomo, di, rialto, an, annunciation, in, santi, giovanni, e, paolo, christ, fulminant, a, son, of, marco, named, tiziano, or, tizianello, painted, early, in, the, 17th, century, from, a, different, branch, of, the, family, came, fabrizio, di, ettore, a,

painter, died, in, 1620, there, was, another, relative, girolamo, dante, who, being, a, scholar, and, assistant, of, titian, was, called, girolamo, di, tiziano, various, pictures, of, his, were, touched, up, by, the, master, and, are, difficult, to, distinguish, from, originals, few, of, the, pupils, and, assistants, of, titian, became, well, known, in, their, own, right, for, some, being, his, assistant, was, probably, a, lifetime, career, paris, bordone, and, bonifazio, veronese, were, his, assistants, during, at, some, point, in, their, careers, giulio, clovio, said, titian,

murano, damiano, mazza, and, gaspare, nervesa, contemporary, estimates, attribute, around, 400, works, to, titian, of, which, about, 300, survive, two, of, titian, s, works, in, private, hands, were,

million, the, galleries, had, until, 31, december, 2008, to, make, the, purchase, before, the, work, would, be, offered, to, private, collectors, but, the, deadline, was, extended, the, sale, created, controversy, with, politicians, who, argued, that, the, money, could, have, been, spent, more, wisely, during, a, deepening, recession, the, scottish, government, offered, 12, 5, million, and, 10, million, came, from, the, national, heritage, memorial, fund, the, rest, of, the, money, came, from, the, national, gallery, and, from, private, donations, the, other, painting, diana, and, callisto,
