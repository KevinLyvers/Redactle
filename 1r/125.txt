in, western, art, born, in, moscow, he, spent, his, childhood, in, odessa, where, he, graduated, from, odessa, art, school, he, enrolled, at, the, university, of, moscow, studying, law, and,

life, drawing, sketching, and, anatomy, at, the, age, of, 30, in, 1896, kandinsky, settled, in, munich, studying, first, at, anton, a, be, s, private, school, and, then, at, the, academy, of, fine, arts, he, returned, to, moscow, in, 1914, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, following, the, russian, revolution, kandinsky, became, an, insider, in, the, cultural, administration, of, anatoly, lunacharsky, and, helped, establish, the, museum, of, the, culture, of, painting, however, by, then, his, spiritual, outlook, was, foreign, to, the, argumentative, materialism, of, soviet, society, and, opportunities, beckoned, in, germany, to, which, he, returned, in, 1920, there, he, taught, at, the, bauhaus, school, of, art, and, architecture, from, 1922, until, the, nazis, closed, it, in, 1933, he, then, moved, to, france, where, he, lived, for, the, rest, of, his, life, becoming, a, french, citizen, in, 1939, and, producing, some, of, his, most, prominent, art, he, died, in, neuilly, sur, seine, in, 1944, three, days, before, his, 78th, birthday, kandinsky, was, born, in, moscow, the, son, of, lidia, ticheeva, and, vasily, silvestrovich, kandinsky, a, tea, merchant, one, of, his, great, grandmothers, was, princess, gantimurova, kandinsky, learned, from, a, variety, of, sources, while, in, moscow, he, studied, many, fields, while, in, school, including, law, and, economics, later, in, life, he, would, recall, being, fascinated, and, stimulated, by, colour, as, a, child, his, fascination, with, colour, symbolism, and, psychology, continued, as, he, grew, in, 1889, at, age, 23, he, was, part, of, an, ethnographic, research, group, that, travelled, to, the, vologda, region, north, of, moscow, in, looks, on, the, past, he, relates, that, the, houses, and, churches, were, decorated, with, such, shimmering, colours, that, upon, entering, them, he, felt, that, he, was, moving, into, a, painting, this, experience, as, well, as, his, study, of, the, region, s, folk, art, particularly, the, use, of, bright, colours, on, a, dark, background, were, reflected, in, much, of, his, early, work, a, few, years, later, he, first, likened, painting, to, composing, music, in, the, manner, for, which, he, would, become, noted, writing, colour, is, the, keyboard, the, eyes, are, the, harmony, the, soul, is, the, piano, with, many, strings, the, artist, is, the, hand, which, plays, touching, one, key, or, another, to, cause, vibrations, in, the, soul, kandinsky, was, also, the, uncle, of, russian, french, philosopher, alexandre, koj, ve, 1902, 1968, kandinsky, s, creation, of, abstract, work, followed, a, long, period, of, development, and, maturation, of, intense, thought, based, on, his, artistic, experiences, he, called, this, devotion, to, inner, beauty, fervor, of, spirit, and, spiritual, desire, inner, necessity, it, was, a, central, aspect, of, his, art, some, art, historians, suggest, that, kandinsky, s, passion, for, abstract, art, began, when, one, day, coming, back, home, he, found, one, of, his, own, paintings, hanging, upside, down, in, his, studio, and, he, stared, at, it, for, a, while, before, realizing, it, was, his, own, work, suggesting, to, him, the, potential, power, of, abstraction, in, 1896, at, the, age, of, 30, kandinsky, gave, up, a, promising, career, teaching, law, and, economics, to, enroll, in, the, munich, academy, where, his, teachers, would, eventually, include, franz, von, stuck, he, was, not, immediately, granted, admission, and, began, learning, art, on, his, own, that, same, year, before, leaving, moscow, he, saw, an, exhibit, of, paintings, by, monet, he, was, particularly, taken, with, the, impressionistic, style, of, haystacks, this, to, him, had, a, powerful, sense, of, colour, almost, independent, of, the, objects, themselves, later, he, would, write, about, this, experience, that, it, was, a, haystack, the, catalogue, informed, me, i, could, not, recognise, it, this, non, recognition, was, painful, to, me, i, considered, that, the, painter, had, no, right, to, paint, indistinctly, i, dully, felt, that, the, object, of, the, painting, was, missing, and, i, noticed, with, surprise, and, confusion, that, the, picture, not, only, gripped, me, but, impressed, itself, ineradicably, on, my, memory, painting, took, on, a, fairy, tale, power, and, splendour, kandinsky, was, similarly, influenced, during, this, period, by, richard, wagner, s, lohengrin, which, he, felt, pushed, the, limits, of, music, and, melody, beyond, standard, lyricism, he, was, also, spiritually, influenced, by, madame, blavatsky, 1831, 1891, the, best, known, exponent, of, theosophy, theosophical, theory, postulates, that, creation, is, a, geometrical, progression, beginning, with, a, single, point, the, creative, aspect, of, the, form, is, expressed, by, a, descending, series, of, circles, triangles, and, squares, kandinsky, s, book, concerning, the, spiritual, in, art, 1910, and, point, and, line, to, plane, 1926, echoed, this, theosophical, tenet, illustrations, by, john, varley, in, thought, forms, 1901, influenced, him, visually, in, the, summer, of, 1902, kandinsky, invited, gabriele, m, nter, to, join, him, at, his, summer, painting, classes, just, south, of, munich, in, the, alps, she, accepted, the, offer, and, their, relationship, became, more, personal, than, professional, art, school, usually, considered, difficult, was, easy, for, kandinsky, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, began, to, emerge, as, an, art, theorist, as, well, as, a, painter, the, number, of, his, existing, paintings, increased, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, much, remains, of, the, landscapes, and, towns, he, painted, using, broad, swaths, of, colour, and, recognisable, forms, for, the, most, part, however, kandinsky, s, paintings, did, not, feature, any, human, figures, an, exception, is, sunday, old, russia, 1904, in, which, kandinsky, recreates, a, highly, colourful, and, fanciful, view, of, peasants, and, nobles, in, front, of, the, walls, of, a, town, couple, on, horseback, 1907, depicts, a, man, on, horseback, holding, a, woman, as, they, ride, past, a, russian, town, with, luminous, walls, across, a, blue, river, the, horse, is, muted, while, the, leaves, in, the, trees, the, town, and, the, reflections, in, the, river, glisten, with, spots, of, colour, and, brightness, this, work, demonstrates, the, influence, of, pointillism, in, the, way, the, depth, of, field, is, collapsed, into, a, flat, luminescent, surface, fauvism, is, also, apparent, in, these, early, works, colours, are, used, to, express, kandinsky, s, experience, of, subject, matter, not, to, describe, objective, nature, perhaps, the, most, important, of, his, paintings, from, the, first, decade, of, the, 1900s, was, the, blue, rider, 1903, which, shows, a, small, cloaked, figure, on, a, speeding, horse, rushing, through, a, rocky, meadow, the, rider, s, cloak, is, medium, blue, which, casts, a, darker, blue, shadow, in, the, foreground, are, more, amorphous, blue, shadows, the, counterparts, of, the, fall, trees, in, the, background, the, blue, rider, in, the, painting, is, prominent, but, not, clearly, defined, and, the, horse, has, an, unnatural, gait, which, kandinsky, must, have, known, this, intentional, disjunction, allowing, viewers, to, participate, in, the, creation, of, the, artwork, became, an, increasingly, conscious, technique, used, by, kandinsky, in, subsequent, years, it, culminated, in, the, abstract, works, of, the, 1911, 1914, period, in, the, blue, rider, kandinsky, shows, the, rider, more, as, a, series, of, colours, than, in, specific, detail, this, painting, is, not, exceptional, in, that, regard, when, compared, with, contemporary, painters, but, it, shows, the, direction, kandinsky, would, take, only, a, few, years, later, from, 1906, to, 1908, kandinsky, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, travelling, across, europe, he, was, an, associate, of, the, blue, rose, symbolist, group, of, moscow, until, he, settled, in, the, small, bavarian, town, of, murnau, in, 1908, he, bought, a, copy, of, thought, forms, by, annie, besant, and, charles, webster, leadbeater, in, 1909, he, joined, the, theosophical, society, the, blue, mountain, 1908, 1909, was, painted, at, this, time, demonstrating, his, trend, toward, abstraction, a, mountain, of, blue, is, flanked, by, two, broad, trees, one, yellow, and, one, red, a, procession, with, three, riders, and, several, others, crosses, at, the, bottom, the, faces, clothing, and, saddles, of, the, riders, are, each, a, single, color, and, neither, they, nor, the, walking, figures, display, any, real, detail, the, flat, planes, and, the, contours, also, are, indicative, of, fauvist, influence, the, broad, use, of, color, in, the, blue, mountain, illustrates, kandinsky, s, inclination, toward, an, art, in, which, colour, is, presented, independently, of, form, and, in, which, each, color, is, given, equal, attention, the, composition, is, more, planar, the, painting, is, divided, into, four, sections, the, sky, the, red, tree, the, yellow, tree, and, the, blue, mountain, with, the, three, riders, kandinsky, s, paintings, from, this, period, are, large, expressive, coloured, masses, evaluated, independently, from, forms, and, lines, these, serve, no, longer, to, delimit, them, but, overlap, freely, to, form, paintings, of, extraordinary, force, music, was, important, to, the, birth, of, abstract, art, since, it, is, abstract, by, nature, it, does, not, try, to, represent, the, exterior, world, but, expresses, the, inner, feelings, of, the, soul, in, an, immediate, way, kandinsky, sometimes, used, musical, terms, to, identify, his, works, he, called, his, most, spontaneous, paintings, improvisations, and, described, more, elaborate, works, as, compositions, in, addition, to, painting, kandinsky, was, an, art, theorist, his, influence, on, the, history, of, western, art, stems, perhaps, more, from, his, theoretical, works, than, from, his, paintings, he, helped, found, the, neue, k, nstlervereinigung, m, nchen, munich, new, artists, association, becoming, its, president, in, 1909, however, the, group, could, not, integrate, the, radical, approach, of, kandinsky, and, others, with, conventional, artistic, concepts, and, the, group, dissolved, in, late, 1911, kandinsky, then, formed, a, new, group, the, blue, rider, der, blaue, reiter, with, like, minded, artists, such, as, august, macke, franz, marc, albert, bloch, and, gabriele, m, nter, the, group, released, an, almanac, the, blue, rider, almanac, and, held, two, exhibits, more, of, each, were, planned, but, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, ended, these, plans, and, sent, kandinsky, back, to, russia, via, switzerland, and, sweden, his, writing, in, the, blue, rider, almanac, and, the, treatise, on, the, spiritual, in, art, which, was, released, in, 1910, were, both, a, defence, and, promotion, of, abstract, art, and, an, affirmation, that, all, forms, of, art, were, equally, capable, of, reaching, a, level, of, spirituality, he, believed, that, colour, could, be, used, in, a, painting, as, something, autonomous, apart, from, the, visual, description, of, an, object, or, other, form, these, ideas, had, an, almost, immediate, international, impact, particularly, in, the, english, speaking, world, as, early, as, 1912, on, the, spiritual, in, art, was, reviewed, by, michael, sadleir, in, the, london, based, art, news, interest, in, kandinsky, grew, quickly, when, sadleir, published, an, english, translation, of, on, the, spiritual, in, art, in, 1914, extracts, from, the, book, were, published, that, year, in, percy, wyndham, lewis, s, periodical, blast, and, alfred, orage, s, weekly, cultural, newspaper, the, new, age, kandinsky, had, received, some, notice, earlier, in, britain, however, in, 1910, he, participated, in, the, allied, artists, exhibition, organised, by, frank, rutter, at, london, s, royal, albert, hall, this, resulted, in, his, work, being, singled, out, for, praise, in, a, review, of, that, show, by, the, artist, spencer, frederick, gore, in, the, art, news, sadleir, s, interest, in, kandinsky, also, led, to, kandinsky, s, first, works, entering, a, british, art, collection, sadleir, s, father, michael, sadler, acquired, several, wood, prints, and, the, abstract, painting, fragment, for, composition, vii, in, 1913, following, a, visit, by, father, and, son, to, meet, kandinsky, in, munich, that, year, these, works, were, displayed, in, leeds, either, in, the, university, or, the, premises, of, the, leeds, arts, club, between, 1913, and, 1923, the, sun, melts, all, of, moscow, down, to, a, single, spot, that, like, a, mad, tuba, starts, all, of, the, heart, and, all, of, the, soul, vibrating, but, no, this, uniformity, of, red, is, not, the, most, beautiful, hour, it, is, only, the, final, chord, of, a, symphony, that, takes, every, colour, to, the, zenith, of, life, that, like, the, fortissimo, of, a, great, orchestra, is, both, compelled, and, allowed, by, moscow, to, ring, out, from, 1918, to, 1921, kandinsky, was, involved, in, the, cultural, politics, of, russia, and, collaborated, in, art, education, and, museum, reform, he, painted, little, during, this, period, but, devoted, his, time, to, artistic, teaching, with, a, program, based, on, form, and, colour, analysis, he, also, helped, organize, the, institute, of, artistic, culture, in, moscow, of, which, he, was, its, first, director, his, spiritual, expressionistic, view, of, art, was, ultimately, rejected, by, the, radical, members, of, the, institute, as, too, individualistic, and, bourgeois, in, 1921, kandinsky, was, invited, to, go, to, germany, to, attend, the, bauhaus, of, weimar, by, its, founder, architect, walter, gropius, in, may, 1922, he, attended, the, international, congress, of, progressive, artists, and, signed, the, founding, proclamation, of, the, union, of, progressive, international, artists, kandinsky, taught, the, basic, design, class, for, beginners, and, the, course, on, advanced, theory, at, the, bauhaus, he, also, conducted, painting, classes, and, a, workshop, in, which, he, augmented, his, colour, theory, with, new, elements, of, form, psychology, the, development, of, his, works, on, forms, study, particularly, on, points, and, line, forms, led, to, the, publication, of, his, second, theoretical, book, point, and, line, to, plane, in, 1926, his, examinations, of, the, effects, of, forces, on, straight, lines, leading, to, the, contrasting, tones, of, curved, and, angled, lines, coincided, with, the, research, of, gestalt, psychologists, whose, work, was, also, discussed, at, the, bauhaus, geometrical, elements, took, on, increasing, importance, in, both, his, teaching, and, painting, particularly, the, circle, half, circle, the, angle, straight, lines, and, curves, this, period, was, intensely, productive, this, freedom, is, characterised, in, his, works, by, the, treatment, of, planes, rich, in, colours, and, gradations, as, in, yellow, red, blue, 1925, where, kandinsky, illustrates, his, distance, from, the, constructivism, and, suprematism, movements, influential, at, the, time, the, two, metre, wide, 6, ft, 7, in, yellow, red, blue, 1925, of, several, main, forms, a, vertical, yellow, rectangle, an, inclined, red, cross, and, a, large, dark, blue, circle, a, multitude, of, straight, or, sinuous, black, lines, circular, arcs, monochromatic, circles, and, scattered, coloured, checker, boards, contribute, to, its, delicate, complexity, this, simple, visual, identification, of, forms, and, the, main, coloured, masses, present, on, the, canvas, is, only, a, first, approach, to, the, inner, reality, of, the, work, whose, appreciation, necessitates, deeper, observation, not, only, of, forms, and, colours, involved, in, the, painting, but, their, relationship, their, absolute, and, relative, positions, on, the, canvas, and, their, harmony, kandinsky, was, one, of, die, blaue, vier, the, blue, four, which, was, a, group, that, was, formed, in, 1923, with, paul, klee, lyonel, feininger, and, alexej, von, jawlensky, at, the, instigation, of, galka, scheyer, who, promoted, their, work, in, the, united, states, from, 1924, onward, due, to, right, wing, hostility, the, bauhaus, left, weimar, for, dessau, in, 1925, following, a, nazi, smear, campaign, the, bauhaus, left, dessau, in, 1932, for, berlin, where, it, remained, until, its, dissolution, in, july, 1933, kandinsky, then, left, germany, settling, in, paris, living, in, an, apartment, in, paris, kandinsky, created, his, work, in, a, living, room, studio, biomorphic, forms, with, supple, non, geometric, outlines, appear, in, his, paintings, forms, which, suggest, microscopic, organisms, but, express, the, artist, s, inner, life, kandinsky, used, original, colour, compositions, evoking, slavic, popular, art, he, also, occasionally, mixed, sand, with, paint, to, give, a, granular, rustic, texture, to, his, paintings, this, period, corresponds, to, a, synthesis, of, kandinsky, s, previous, work, in, which, he, used, all, elements, enriching, them, in, 1936, and, 1939, he, painted, his, final, two, major, compositions, the, type, of, elaborate, canvases, he, had, not, produced, for, many, years, composition, ix, has, highly, contrasted, powerful, diagonals, whose, central, form, gives, the, impression, of, an, embryo, in, the, womb, small, squares, of, colours, and, coloured, bands, stand, out, against, the, black, background, of, composition, x, as, star, fragments, or, filaments, while, enigmatic, hieroglyphs, with, pastel, tones, cover, a, large, maroon, mass, which, seems, to, float, in, the, upper, left, corner, of, the, canvas, in, kandinsky, s, work, some, characteristics, are, obvious, while, certain, touches, are, more, discreet, and, veiled, they, reveal, themselves, only, progressively, to, those, who, deepen, their, connection, with, his, work, he, intended, his, forms, which, he, subtly, harmonised, and, placed, to, resonate, with, the, observer, s, soul, writing, that, music, is, the, ultimate, teacher, kandinsky, embarked, upon, the, first, seven, of, his, ten, compositions, the, first, three, survive, only, in, black, and, white, photographs, taken, by, fellow, artist, and, friend, gabriele, m, nter, composition, i, 1910, was, destroyed, by, a, british, air, raid, on, the, city, of, braunschweig, in, lower, saxony, on, the, night, of, 14, october, 1944, while, studies, sketches, and, improvisations, exist, particularly, of, composition, ii, a, nazi, raid, on, the, bauhaus, in, the, 1930s, resulted, in, the, confiscation, of, kandinsky, s, first, three, compositions, they, were, displayed, in, the, state, sponsored, degenerate, art, exhibition, and, were, then, destroyed, along, with, works, by, paul, klee, franz, marc, and, other, modern, artists, fascinated, by, christian, eschatology, and, the, perception, of, a, coming, new, age, a, common, theme, among, kandinsky, s, first, seven, compositions, is, the, apocalypse, the, end, of, the, world, as, we, know, it, writing, of, the, artist, as, prophet, in, his, book, concerning, the, spiritual, in, art, kandinsky, created, paintings, in, the, years, immediately, preceding, world, war, i, showing, a, coming, cataclysm, which, would, alter, individual, and, social, reality, having, a, devout, belief, in, orthodox, christianity, kandinsky, drew, upon, the, biblical, stories, of, noah, s, ark, jonah, and, the, whale, christ, s, resurrection, the, four, horsemen, of, the, apocalypse, in, the, book, of, revelation, russian, folktales, and, the, common, mythological, experiences, of, death, and, rebirth, never, attempting, to, picture, any, one, of, these, stories, as, a, narrative, he, used, their, veiled, imagery, as, symbols, of, the, archetypes, of, death, rebirth, and, destruction, creation, he, felt, were, imminent, in, the, pre, world, war, i, world, as, he, stated, in, concerning, the, spiritual, in, art, see, below, kandinsky, felt, that, an, authentic, artist, creating, art, from, an, internal, necessity, inhabits, the, tip, of, an, upward, moving, pyramid, this, progressing, pyramid, is, penetrating, and, proceeding, into, the, future, what, was, odd, or, inconceivable, yesterday, is, commonplace, today, what, is, avant, garde, today, and, understood, only, by, the, few, is, common, knowledge, tomorrow, the, modern, artist, prophet, stands, alone, at, the, apex, of, the, pyramid, making, new, discoveries, and, ushering, in, tomorrow, s, reality, kandinsky, was, aware, of, recent, scientific, developments, and, the, advances, of, modern, artists, who, had, contributed, to, radically, new, ways, of, seeing, and, experiencing, the, world, composition, iv, and, later, paintings, are, primarily, concerned, with, evoking, a, spiritual, resonance, in, viewer, and, artist, as, in, his, painting, of, the, apocalypse, by, water, composition, vi, kandinsky, puts, the, viewer, in, the, situation, of, experiencing, these, epic, myths, by, translating, them, into, contemporary, terms, with, a, sense, of, desperation, flurry, urgency, and, confusion, this, spiritual, communion, of, viewer, painting, artist, prophet, may, be, described, within, the, limits, of, words, and, images, as, the, der, blaue, reiter, almanac, essays, and, theorising, with, composer, arnold, schoenberg, indicate, kandinsky, also, expressed, the, communion, between, artist, and, viewer, as, being, available, to, both, the, senses, and, the, mind, synesthesia, hearing, tones, and, chords, as, he, painted, kandinsky, theorised, that, for, example, yellow, is, the, colour, of, middle, c, on, a, brassy, trumpet, black, is, the, colour, of, closure, and, the, end, of, things, and, that, combinations, of, colours, produce, vibrational, frequencies, akin, to, chords, played, on, a, piano, in, 1871, the, young, kandinsky, learned, to, play, the, piano, and, cello, kandinsky, also, developed, a, theory, of, geometric, figures, and, their, relationships, claiming, for, example, that, the, circle, is, the, most, peaceful, shape, and, represents, the, human, soul, these, theories, are, explained, in, point, and, line, to, plane, kandinsky, s, legendary, stage, design, for, a, performance, of, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, illustrates, his, synesthetic, concept, of, a, universal, correspondence, of, forms, colors, and, musical, sounds, in, 1928, the, stage, production, premiered, at, a, theater, in, dessau, in, 2015, the, original, designs, of, the, stage, elements, were, animated, with, modern, video, technology, and, synchronized, with, the, music, according, to, the, preparatory, notes, of, kandinsky, and, the, director, s, script, of, felix, klee, in, another, episode, with, m, nter, during, the, bavarian, abstract, expressionist, years, kandinsky, was, working, on, composition, vi, from, nearly, six, months, of, study, and, preparation, he, had, intended, the, work, to, evoke, a, flood, baptism, destruction, and, rebirth, simultaneously, after, outlining, the, work, on, a, mural, sized, wood, panel, he, became, blocked, and, could, not, go, on, m, nter, told, him, that, he, was, trapped, in, his, intellect, and, not, reaching, the, true, subject, of, the, picture, she, suggested, he, simply, repeat, the, word, uberflut, deluge, or, flood, and, focus, on, its, sound, rather, than, its, meaning, repeating, this, word, like, a, mantra, kandinsky, painted, and, completed, the, monumental, work, in, a, three, day, span, wassily, kandinsky, s, art, has, a, confluence, of, music, and, spirituality, with, his, appreciation, for, music, of, his, times, and, kinesthetic, disposition, kandinsky, s, artworks, have, a, marked, style, of, expressionism, in, his, early, years, but, he, embraced, all, types, of, artistic, styles, of, his, times, and, his, predecessors, i, e, art, nouveau, sinuous, organic, forms, fauvism, and, blaue, reiter, shocking, colours, surrealism, mystery, and, bauhaus, constructivism, only, to, move, towards, abstractionism, as, he, explored, spirituality, in, art, his, object, free, paintings, display, spiritual, abstraction, suggested, by, sounds, and, emotions, through, a, unity, of, sensation, driven, by, the, christian, faith, and, the, inner, necessity, of, an, artist, his, paintings, have, the, ambiguity, of, the, form, rendered, in, a, variety, of, colours, as, well, as, resistance, against, conventional, aesthetic, values, of, the, art, world, his, signature, or, individual, style, can, be, further, defined, and, divided, into, three, categories, over, the, course, of, his, art, career, impressions, representational, element, improvisations, spontaneous, emotional, reaction, and, compositions, ultimate, works, of, art, as, kandinsky, started, moving, away, from, his, early, inspiration, from, impressionism, his, paintings, became, more, vibrant, pictographic, and, expressive, with, more, sharp, shapes, and, clear, linear, qualities, but, eventually, kandinsky, went, further, rejecting, pictorial, representation, with, more, synesthetic, swirling, hurricanes, of, colours, and, shapes, eliminating, traditional, references, to, depth, and, laying, out, bare, and, abstracted, glyphs, however, what, remained, consistent, was, his, spiritual, pursuit, of, expressive, forms, emotional, harmony, is, another, salient, feature, in, the, later, works, of, kandinsky, with, diverse, dimensions, and, bright, hues, balanced, through, a, careful, juxtaposition, of, proportion, and, colours, he, substantiated, the, universality, of, shapes, in, his, artworks, thus, paving, the, way, for, further, abstraction, kandinsky, often, used, black, in, his, paintings, to, heighten, the, impact, of, brightly, coloured, forms, while, his, forms, were, often, biomorphic, approaches, to, bring, surrealism, in, his, art, kandinsky, s, analyses, on, forms, and, colours, result, not, from, simple, arbitrary, idea, associations, but, from, the, painter, s, inner, experience, he, spent, years, creating, abstract, sensorially, rich, paintings, working, with, form, and, colour, tirelessly, observing, his, own, paintings, along, with, those, of, other, artists, and, noting, their, effects, on, his, sense, of, colour, this, subjective, experience, is, something, that, anyone, can, do, not, scientific, objective, observations, but, inner, subjective, ones, referred, to, by, french, philosopher, michel, henry, as, absolute, subjectivity, or, the, absolute, phenomenological, life, published, in,

while, impressions, are, based, on, an, external, reality, that, serves, as, a, starting, point, improvisations, and, compositions, depict, images, emergent, from, the, unconscious, though, composition, is, developed, from, a, more, formal, point, of, view, after, graduating, in, 1892, kandinsky, married, his, cousin, anja, chimiakina, and, became, a, lecturer, in, jurisprudence, at,
