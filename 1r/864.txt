thorough, rest, salutary, walks, and, some, extra, pounds, to, fill, out, her, all, too, slender, shape, the, close, relationship, between, anna, and, her, father, was, different, from, the, rest, of,

basic, italian, the, positive, experience, she, had, at, the, lyceum, led, to, her, initial, choice, of, teaching, as, a, career, after, she, left, the, lyceum, in, 1912, she, took, an, extended, vacation, over, the, winter, months, in, italy, this, proved, to, be, for, a, period, a, time, of, self, doubt, anxiety, and, uncertainty, about, her, future, she, shared, these, concerns, in, correspondence, with, her, father, whose, writings, she, had, begun, reading, in, response, he, provided, reassurance, and, in, the, spring, of, 1913, he, joined, her, for, a, tour, of, verona,

romantic, interest, his, advice, to, jones, in, a, letter, of, 22, july, 1914, was, that, his, daughter, does, not, claim, to, be, treated, as, a, woman, being, still, far, away, from, sexual, longings, and, rather, refusing, man, there, is, an, outspoken, understanding, between, me, and, her, that, she, should, not, consider, marriage, or, the, preliminaries, before, she, gets, two, or,

but, she, was, particularly, appreciated, for, her, conscientious, preparations, and, for, her, gift, for, teaching, being, such, a, success, that, she, was, invited, to, stay, on, with, a, regular,

and, contributed, to, seminars, and, conferences, on, the, subject, in, 1935, she, became, director, of, the, vienna, psychoanalytical, training, institute, and, the, following, year, she, published, her, influential, study, of, the, ways, and, means, by, which, the, ego, wards, off, depression, displeasure, and, anxiety, the, ego, and, the, mechanisms, of, defence, it, became, a, founding, work, of, ego, psychology, and, established, freud, s, reputation, as, a, pioneering, theoretician, in, 1938, following, the, anschluss, in, which, nazi, germany, occupied, austria, anna, was, taken, to, gestapo, headquarters, in, vienna, for, questioning, on, the, activities, of, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, unknown, to, her, father, she, and, her, brother, martin, had, obtained, veronal, from, max, schur, the, family, doctor, in, sufficient, quantities, to, commit, suicide, if, faced, with, torture, or, internment, however, she, survived, her, interrogation, ordeal, and, returned, to, the, family, home, after, her, father, had, reluctantly, accepted, the, urgent, need, to, leave, vienna, she, set, about, organizing, the, complex, immigration, process, for, the, family, in, liaison, with, ernest, jones, the, then, president, of, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, who, secured, the, immigration, permits, that, eventually, led, to, the, family, establishing, their, new, home, in, london, at, 20, maresfield, gardens, hampstead, in, 1941, freud, and, burlingham, collaborated, in, establishing, the, hampstead, war, nursery, for, children,

regular, features, of, staff, training, freud, and, burlingham, went, on, to, publish, a, series, of, observational, studies, on, child, development, based, on, the, work, of, the, nursery, with, a, focus, on, the, impact, of, stress, on, children, and, their, capacity, to, find, substitute, affections, among, peers, in, the, absence, of, their, parents, the, bulldog, banks, home, run, on, similar, lines, to, the, nursery, was, established, after, the, war, for, a, group, of, children, who, had, survived, the, concentration, camps, building, on, and, developing, their, war, time, work, with, children, freud, and, burlingham, established, the, hampstead, child, therapy, course, and, clinic, now, the, anna, freud, national, centre, for, children, and, families, in, 1952, as, a, centre, for, therapy, training, and, research, work, during, the, war, years, the, hostility, between, anna, freud, and, melanie, klein, and, their, respective, followers, in, the, british, psychoanalytic, society, bps, grew, more, intense, their, disagreements, which, dated, back, to, the, 1920s, centered, around, the, theory, of, the, genesis, of, the, super, ego, and, the, consequent, clinical, approach, to, the, pre, oedipal, child, klein, argued, for, play, as, an, equivalent, to, free, association, in, adult, analyses, anna, freud, opposed, any, such, equivalence, proposing, an, educative, intervention, with, the, child, until, an, appropriate, level, of, ego, development, was, reached, at, the, oedipal, stage, klein, held, this, to, be, a, collusive, inhibition, of, analytical, work, with, the, child, to, avoid, a, terminal, split, in, the, bps, ernest, jones, its, president, chaired, a, number, of, extraordinary, business, meetings, with, the, aim, of, defusing, the, conflict, and, these, continued, during, the, war, years, the, meetings, which, became, known, as, the, controversial, discussions, were, established, on, a, more, regular, basis, from, 1942, in, 1944, there, finally, emerged, a, compromise, agreement, which, established, parallel, training, courses, providing, options, to, satisfy, the, concerns, of, the, rival, groups, that, had, formed, which, by, then, in, addition, to, the, followers, of, freud, and, klein, included, a, non, aligned, group, of, middle, or, independent, group, analysts, it, was, agreed, further, that, all, the, key, policy, making, committees, of, the, bps, should, have, representatives, from, the, three, groups, from, the, 1950s, until, the, end, of, her, life, freud, travelled, regularly, to, the, united, states, to, lecture, teach, and, visit, friends, during, the, 1970s, she, was, concerned, with, the, problems, of, emotionally, deprived, and, socially, disadvantaged, children, and, she, studied, deviations, and, delays, in, development, at, yale, law, school, she, taught, seminars, on, crime, and, the, family, this, led, to, a, transatlantic, collaboration, with, joseph, goldstein, and, albert, j, solnit, on, children, s, needs, and, the, law, published, in, three, volumes, as, beyond, the, best, interests, of, the, child, 1973, before, the, best, interests, of, the, child, 1979, and, in, the, best, interests, of, the, child, 1986, freud, also, used, her, visits, to, raise, funds, for, the, expanding, work, of, the, hampstead, clinic, and, was, able, to, secure, funding, from, the, national, institute, of, mental, health, the, clinic, was, also, the, beneficiary, of, a, substantial, bequest, from, the, estate, of, marilyn, monroe, who, had, left, money, to, her, new, york, analyst, marianne, kris, with, the, instruction, to, allocate, it, to, support, psychological, clinical, and, research, work, through, a, charity, of, her, choice, the, 1970s, were, also, a, time, of, emotional, stress, for, freud, as, she, endured, a, number, of, bereavements, involving, family, members, and, close, colleagues, her, favourite, brother, ernst, died, in, april, 1970, while, she, was, in, america, in, the, following, months, she, lost, two, of, her, american, cousins, henry, freud, and, rosie, waldinger, and, colleagues, heinz, hartmann, and, max, schur, she, had, further, distress, following, the, deaths, of, her, partner, dorothy, burlingham, s, eldest, son, and, daughter, both, of, whom, had, had, extensive, period, of, analysis, with, her, as, children, in, vienna,

from, her, new, york, home, seeking, further, analysis, with, anna, notwithstanding, the, latter, s, advice, to, continue, in, analysis, with, her, new, york, analyst, whilst, at, the, family, home,

heritage, at, 20, maresfield, gardens, hampstead, in, london, her, home, between, 1938, and, 1982, in, the, context, of, her, intimate, friendships, with, lou, andreas, salome, and, in, particular, with, dorothy, burlingham, with, whom, she, formed, a, life, long, partnership, questions, have, been, raised, in, relation, to, anna, freud, s, sexuality, notwithstanding, the, absence, of, any, evidence, of, and, her, denials, of, any, sexual, relationships, the, historian, of, psychoanalysis, lisabeth, roudinesco, argues, that, it, was, repression, of, her, homoerotic, sexuality, that, influenced, her, in, the, pathologising, of, homosexuality, in, her, clinical, work, as, well, as, in, her, prominent, advocacy, of, the, policy, of, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, which, debarred, homosexuals, as, candidates, for, training, as, psychoanalysts, anna, freud, was, a, prolific, writer, contributing, articles, on, psychoanalysis, to, many, different, publications, throughout, her, lifetime, her, first, publication, was, titled, an, introduction, to, psychoanalysis, lectures, for, child, analysts, and, teachers, 1922, 1935, and, was, the, result, of, four, different, lectures, she, was, delivering, at, the, time, to, teachers, and, caretakers, of, young, children, in, vienna, anna, freud, s, first, article, beating, fantasies, and, daydreams, 1922, drew, in, part, on, her, own, inner, life, but, th, made, her, contribution, no, less, scientific, in, it, she, explained, how, daydreaming, which, consciously, may, be, designed, to, suppress, masturbation, is, mainly, unconsciously, an, elaboration, of, the, original, masturbatory, fantasies, her, father, sigmund, freud, had, earlier, covered, very, similar, ground, in, a, child, is, being, beaten, they, both, used, material, from, her, analysis, as, clinical, illustration, in, their, sometimes, complementary, papers, in, which, he, highlighted, a, female, case, where, an, elaborate, superstructure, of, day, dreams, which, was, of, great, significance, for, the, life, of, the, person, concerned, had, grown, up, over, the, masochistic, beating, phantasy, which, almost, rose, to, the, level, of, a, work, of, art, her, views, on, child, development, which, she, expounded, in, 1927, in, her, first, book, an, introduction, to, the, technique, of, child, analysis, clashed, with, those, of, melanie, klein, was, departing, from, the, developmental, schedule, that, freud, and, his, analyst, daughter, found, most, plausible, in, particular, anna, freud, s, belief, that, in, children, s, analysis, the, transference, plays, a, different, role, and, the, analyst, not, only, represents, mother, but, is, still, an, original, second, mother, in, the, life, of, the, child, became, something, of, an, orthodoxy, over, much, of, the, psychoanalytic, world, for, her, next, major, work, in, 1936, the, ego, and, the, mechanisms, of, defence, a, classic, monograph, on, ego, psychology, and, defense, mechanisms, anna, freud, drew, on, her, own, clinical, experience, but, relied, on, her, father, s, writings, as, the, principal, and, authoritative, source, of, her, theoretical, insights, here, her, cataloguing, of, regression, repression, reaction, formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning, against, the, self, reversal, and, sublimation, helped, establish, the, importance, of, the, ego, functions, and, the, concept, of, defence, mechanisms, continuing, the, greater, emphasis, on, the, ego, than, that, to, be, found, in, the, work, of, her, father, we, should, like, to, learn, more, about, the, ego, during, his, final, decades, special, attention, was, paid, in, it, to, later, childhood, and, adolescent, developments, i, have, always, been, more, attracted, to, the, latency, period, than, the, pre, oedipal, phases, emphasizing, how, the, increased, intellectual, scientific, and, philosophical, interests, of, this, period, represent, attempts, at, mastering, the, drives, the, problem, posed, in, adolescence, by, physiological, maturation, has, been, stated, forcefully, by, anna, freud, aggressive, impulses, are, intensified, to, the, point, of, complete, unruliness, hunger, becomes, voracity, the, reaction, formations, which, seemed, to, be, firmly, established, in, the, structure, of, the, ego, threaten, to, fall, to, pieces, selma, fraiberg, s, tribute, of, 1959, that, the, writings, of, anna, freud, on, ego, psychology, and, her, studies, in, early, child, development, have, illuminated, the, world, of, childhood, for, workers, in, the, most, varied, professions, and, have, been, for, me, my, introduction, and, most, valuable, guide, spoke, at, that, time, for, most, of, psychoanalysis, outside, the, kleinian, heartland, arguably, however, it, was, in, anna, freud, s, london, years, that, she, wrote, her, most, distinguished, psychoanalytic, papers, including, about, losing, and, being, lost, which, everyone, should, read, regardless, of, their, interest, in, psychoanalysis, her, description, therein, of, simultaneous, urges, to, remain, loyal, to, the, dead, and, to, turn, towards, new, ties, with, the, living, may, perhaps, reflect, her, own, mourning, process, after, her, father, s, recent, death, focusing, thereafter, on, research, observation, and, treatment, of, children, anna, freud, established, a, group, of, prominent, child, developmental, analysts, which, included, erik, erikson, elisabeth, geleerd, edith, jacobson, and, margaret, mahler, who, noticed, that, children, s, symptoms, were, ultimately, analogue, to, personality, disorders, among, adults, and, thus, often, related, to, developmental, stages, her, book, normality, and, pathology, in, childhood, 1965,
