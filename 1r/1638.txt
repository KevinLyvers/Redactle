hermann, ludwig, ferdinand, von, helmholtz, formemrs, h, l, m, h, o, l, t, s, german, 31, august, 1821, 8, september, 1894, was, a, german, physicist, and, physician, who, made, significant, contributions, in, several, scientific, fields, particularly, hydrodynamic, stability, the, helmholtz, association, the, largest, german, association, of, research, institutions, is, named, in, his, honour, in, the, fields, of, physiology, and, psychology, helmholtz, is, known, for, his, mathematics, concerning, the, eye, theories, of, vision, ideas, on, the, visual, perception, of, space, colour, vision, research, the, sensation, of, tone, perceptions, of, sound, and, empiricism, in, the, physiology, of, perception, in, physics, he, is, known, for, his, theories, on, the, conservation, of, energy, and, on, the, electrical, double, layer, work, in, electrodynamics, chemical, thermodynamics, and, on, a, mechanical, foundation, of, thermodynamics, as, a, philosopher, he, is, known, for, his, philosophy, of, science, ideas, on, the, relation, between, the, laws, of, perception, and, the, laws, of, nature, the, science, of, aesthetics, and, ideas, on, the, civilizing, power, of, science, helmholtz, was, born, in, potsdam, the, son, of, the, local, gymnasium, headmaster, ferdinand, helmholtz, who, had, studied, classical, philology, and, philosophy, and, who, was, a, close, friend, of, the, publisher, and, philosopher, immanuel, hermann, fichte, helmholtz, s, work, was, influenced, by, the, philosophy, of, johann, gottlieb, fichte, and, immanuel, kant, he, tried, to, trace, their, theories, in, empirical, matters, like, physiology, as, a, young, man, helmholtz, was, interested, in, natural, science, but, his, father, wanted, him, to, study, medicine, helmholtz, earned, a, medical, doctorate, at, medicinisch, chirurgisches, friedrich, wilhelm, institute, in, 1842, and, served, a, one, year, internship, at, the, charit, hospital, because, there, was, financial, support, for, medical, students, trained, primarily, in, physiology, helmholtz, wrote, on, many, other, topics, ranging, from, theoretical, physics, to, the, age, of, the, earth, and, to, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, helmholtz, s, first, academic, position, was, as, a, teacher, of, anatomy, at, the, academy, of, arts, in, berlin, in, 1848, he, then, moved, to, take, a, post, of, associate, professor, of, physiology, at, the, prussian, university, of, k, nigsberg, where, he, was, appointed, in, 1849, in, 1855, he, accepted, a, full, professorship, of, anatomy, and, physiology, at, the, university, of, bonn, he, was, not, particularly, happy, in, bonn, however, and, three, years, later, he, transferred, to, the, university, of, heidelberg, in, baden, where, he, served, as, professor, of, physiology, in, 1871, he, accepted, his, final, university, position, as, professor, of, physics, at, the, friedrich, wilhelm, university, in, berlin, his, first, important, scientific, achievement, an, 1847, treatise, on, the, conservation, of, energy, was, written, in, the, context, of, his, medical, studies, and, philosophical, background, his, work, on, energy, conservation, came, about, while, studying, muscle, metabolism, he, tried, to, demonstrate, that, no, energy, is, lost, in, muscle, movement, motivated, by, the, implication, that, there, were, no, vital, forces, necessary, to, move, a, muscle, this, was, a, rejection, of, the, speculative, tradition, of, naturphilosophie, and, vitalism, which, was, at, that, time, a, dominant, philosophical, paradigm, in, german, physiology, he, was, working, against, the, argument, promoted, by, some, vitalists, that, living, force, can, power, a, machine, indefinitely, drawing, on, the, earlier, work, of, sadi, carnot, beno, t, paul, mile, clapeyron, and, james, prescott, joule, he, postulated, a, relationship, between, mechanics, heat, light, electricity, and, magnetism, by, treating, them, all, as, manifestations, of, a, single, force, or, energy, in, today, s, terminology, he, published, his, theories, in, his, book, ber, die, erhaltung, der, kraft, on, the, conservation, of, force, 1847, in, the, 1850s, and, 60s, building, on, the, publications, of, william, thomson, helmholtz, and, william, rankine, popularized, the, idea, of, the, heat, death, of, the, universe, in, fluid, dynamics, helmholtz, made, several, contributions, including, helmholtz, s, theorems, for, vortex, dynamics, in, inviscid, fluids, helmholtz, was, a, pioneer, in, the, scientific, study, of, human, vision, and, audition, inspired, by, psychophysics, he, was, interested, in, the, relationships, between, measurable, physical, stimuli, and, their, correspondent, human, perceptions, for, example, the, amplitude, of, a, sound, wave, can, be, varied, causing, the, sound, to, appear, louder, or, softer, but, a, linear, step, in, sound, pressure, amplitude, does, not, result, in, a, linear, step, in, perceived, loudness, the, physical, sound, needs, to, be, increased, exponentially, in, order, for, equal, steps, to, seem, linear, a, fact, that, is, used, in, current, electronic, devices, to, control, volume, helmholtz, paved, the, way, in, experimental, studies, on, the, relationship, between, the, physical, energy, physics, and, its, appreciation, psychology, with, the, goal, in, mind, to, develop, psychophysical, laws, the, sensory, physiology, of, helmholtz, was, the, basis, of, the, work, of, wilhelm, wundt, a, student, of, helmholtz, who, is, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, experimental, psychology, more, explicitly, than, helmholtz, wundt, described, his, research, as, a, form, of, empirical, philosophy, and, as, a, study, of, the, mind, as, something, separate, helmholtz, had, in, his, early, repudiation, of, naturphilosophie, stressed, the, importance, of, materialism, and, was, focusing, more, on, the, unity, of, mind, and, body, in, 1851, helmholtz, revolutionized, the, field, of, ophthalmology, with, the, invention, of, the, ophthalmoscope, an, instrument, used, to, examine, the, inside, of, the, human, eye, this, made, him, world, famous, overnight, helmholtz, s, interests, at, that, time, were, increasingly, focused, on, the, physiology, of, the, senses, his, main, publication, titled, handbuch, der, physiologischen, optik, handbook, of, physiological, optics, or, treatise, on, physiological, optics, english, translation, of, the, 3rd, volume, here, provided, empirical, theories, on, depth, perception, colour, vision, and, motion, perception, and, became, the, fundamental, reference, work, in, his, field, during, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, the, third, and, final, volume, published, in, 1867, helmholtz, described, the, importance, of, unconscious, inferences, for, perception, the, handbuch, was, first, translated, into, english, under, the, editorship, of, james, p, c, southall, on, behalf, of, the, optical, society, of, america, in, 1924, 5, his, theory, of, accommodation, went, unchallenged, until, the, final, decade, of, the, 20th, century, helmholtz, continued, to, work, for, several, decades, on, several, editions, of, the, handbook, frequently, updating, his, work, because, of, his, dispute, with, ewald, hering, who, held, opposite, views, on, spatial, and, colour, vision, this, dispute, divided, the, discipline, of, physiology, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1800s, in, 1849, while, at, k, nigsberg, helmholtz, measured, the, speed, at, which, the, signal, is, carried, along, a, nerve, fibre, at, that, time, most, people, believed, that, nerve, signals, passed, along, nerves, immeasurably, fast, he, used, a, recently, dissected, sciatic, nerve, of, a, frog, and, the, calf, muscle, to, which, it, attached, he, used, a, galvanometer, as, a, sensitive, timing, device, attaching, a, mirror, to, the, needle, to, reflect, a, light, beam, across, the, room, to, a, scale, which, gave, much, greater, sensitivity, helmholtz, reported, transmission, speeds, in, the, range, of, 24, 6, 38, 4, meters, per, second, in, 1863, helmholtz, published, sensations, of, tone, once, again, demonstrating, his, interest, in, the, physics, of, perception, this, book, influenced, musicologists, into, the, twentieth, century, helmholtz, invented, the, helmholtz, resonator, to, identify, the, various, frequencies, or, pitches, of, the, pure, sine, wave, components, of, complex, sounds, containing, multiple, tones, helmholtz, showed, that, different, combinations, of, resonators, could, mimic, vowel, sounds, alexander, graham, bell, in, particular, was, interested, in, this, but, not, being, able, to, read, german, misconstrued, helmholtz, s, diagrams, as, meaning, that, helmholtz, had, transmitted, multiple, frequencies, by, wire, which, would, allow, multiplexing, of, telegraph, signals, whereas, in, reality, electrical, power, was, used, only, to, keep, the, resonators, in, motion, bell, failed, to, reproduce, what, he, thought, helmholtz, had, done, but, later, said, that, had, he, been, able, to, read, german, he, would, not, have, gone, on, to, invent, the, telephone, on, the, harmonic, telegraph, principle, the, translation, by, alexander, j, ellis, was, first, published, in, 1875, the, first, english, edition, was, from, the, 1870, third, german, edition, ellis, s, second, english, edition, from, the, 1877, fourth, german, edition, was, published, in, 1885, the, 1895, and, 1912, third, and, fourth, english, editions, were, reprints, of, the, second, helmholtz, studied, the, phenomena, of, electrical, oscillations, from, 1869, to, 1871, and, in, a, lecture, delivered, to, the, naturhistorisch, medizinischen, vereins, zu, heidelberg, natural, history, and, medical, association, of, heidelberg, on, 30, april, 1869, titled, on, electrical, oscillations, he, indicated, that, the, perceptible, damped, electrical, oscillations, in, a, coil, joined, up, with, a, leyden, jar, were, about, 1, 50th, of, a, second, in, duration, in, 1871, helmholtz, moved, from, heidelberg, to, berlin, to, become, a, professor, of, physics, he, became, interested, in, electromagnetism, and, the, helmholtz, equation, is, named, for, him, although, he, did, not, make, major, contributions, to, this, field, his, student, heinrich, rudolf, hertz, became, famous, as, the, first, to, demonstrate, electromagnetic, radiation, oliver, heaviside, criticised, helmholtz, s, electromagnetic, theory, because, it, allowed, the, existence, of, longitudinal, waves, based, on, work, on, maxwell, s, equations, heaviside, pronounced, that, longitudinal, waves, could, not, exist, in, a, vacuum, or, a, homogeneous, medium, heaviside, did, not, note, however, that, longitudinal, electromagnetic, waves, can, exist, at, a, boundary, or, in, an, enclosed, space, helmholtz, wavered, between, empiricism, and, transcendentalism, in, his, philosophy, of, science, whoever, in, the, pursuit, of, science, seeks, after, immediate, practical, utility, may, rest, assured, that, he, seeks, in, vain, academic, discourse, heidelberg, 1862, other, students, and, research, associates, of, helmholtz, at, berlin, included, max, planck, heinrich, kayser, eugen, goldstein, wilhelm, wien, arthur, k, nig, henry, augustus, rowland, albert, a, michelson, wilhelm, wundt, fernando, sanford, and, michael, i, pupin, leo, koenigsberger, who, was, his, colleague, from, 1869, to, 1871, in, heidelberg, wrote, the, definitive, biography, of, him, in, 1902
