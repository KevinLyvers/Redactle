jonas, edward, salk, s, l, k, born, jonas, salk, october, 28, 1914, june, 23, 1995, was, an, american, virologist, and, medical, researcher, who, developed, one, of, the, first, successful, polio, vaccines, he, was, born, in, new, york, city, and, attended, the, city, college, of, new, york, and, new, york, university, school, of, medicine, in, 1947, salk, accepted, a, professorship, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, school, of, medicine, where, he, undertook, a, project, beginning, in, 1948, to, determine, the, number, of, different, types, of, poliovirus, for, the, next, seven, years, salk, devoted, himself, to, developing, a, vaccine, against, polio, salk, was, immediately, hailed, as, a, miracle, worker, when, the, vaccine, s, success, was, first, made, public, in, april, 1955, and, chose, to, not, patent, the, vaccine, or, seek, any, profit, from, it, in, order, to, maximize, its, global, distribution, the, national, foundation, for, infantile, paralysis, and, the, university, of, pittsburgh, looked, into, patenting, the, vaccine, but, since, salk, s, techniques, were, not, novel, their, patent, attorney, said, if, there, were, any, patentable, novelty, to, be, found, in, this, phase, it, would, lie, within, an, extremely, narrow, scope, and, would, be, of, doubtful, value, an, immediate, rush, to, vaccinate, began, in, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, many, countries, began, polio, immunization, campaigns, using, salk, s, vaccine, including, canada, sweden, denmark, norway, west, germany, the, netherlands, switzerland, and, belgium, by, 1959, the, salk, vaccine, had, reached, about, 90, countries, an, attenuated, live, oral, polio, vaccine, was, developed, by, albert, sabin, coming, into, commercial, use, in, 1961, less, than, 25, years, after, the, release, of, salk, s, vaccine, domestic, transmission, of, polio, had, been, eliminated, in, the, united, states, in, 1963, salk, founded, the, salk, institute, for, biological, studies, in, la, jolla, california, which, is, today, a, center, for, medical, and, scientific, research, he, continued, to, conduct, research, and, publish, books, in, his, later, years, focusing, in, his, last, years, on, the, search, for, a, vaccine, against, hiv, salk, campaigned, vigorously, for, mandatory, vaccination, throughout, the, rest, of, his, life, calling, the, universal, vaccination, of, children, against, disease, a, moral, commitment, salk, s, personal, papers, are, today, stored, in, geisel, library, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, jonas, salk, was, born, in, new, york, city, to, daniel, and, dora, n, e, press, salk, his, parents, were, jewish, daniel, was, born, in, new, jersey, to, immigrant, parents, and, dora, who, was, born, in, minsk, emigrated, to, the, united, states, when, she, was, twelve, salk, s, parents, did, not, receive, extensive, formal, education, jonas, had, two, younger, brothers, herman, and, lee, a, child, psychologist, the, family, moved, from, east, harlem, to, 853, elsmere, place, in, the, bronx, with, some, time, spent, in, queens, at, 439, beach, 69th, street, arverne, when, he, was, 13, salk, entered, townsend, harris, high, school, a, public, school, for, intellectually, gifted, students, named, after, the, founder, of, city, college, of, new, york, ccny, it, was, a, launching, pad, for, the, talented, sons, of, immigrant, parents, who, lacked, the, money, and, pedigree, to, attend, a, top, private, school, according, to, david, oshinsky, his, biographer, in, high, school, he, was, known, as, a, perfectionist, who, read, everything, he, could, lay, his, hands, on, according, to, one, of, his, fellow, students, students, had, to, cram, a, four, year, curriculum, into, just, three, years, as, a, result, most, dropped, out, or, flunked, out, despite, the, school, s, motto, study, study, study, however, of, the, students, who, graduated, most, had, the, grades, to, enroll, in, ccny, then, noted, for, being, a, highly, competitive, college, 96, salk, enrolled, in, ccny, where, he, earned, a, bachelor, of, science, degree, in, chemistry, in, 1934, oshinsky, writes, that, for, working, class, immigrant, families, city, college, represented, the, apex, of, public, higher, education, getting, in, was, tough, but, tuition, was, free, competition, was, intense, but, the, rules, were, fairly, applied, no, one, got, an, advantage, based, on, an, accident, of, birth, at, his, mother, s, urging, he, put, aside, aspirations, of, becoming, a, lawyer, and, instead, concentrated, on, classes, necessary, for, admission, to, medical, school, however, according, to, oshinsky, the, facilities, at, city, college, were, barely, second, rate, there, were, no, research, laboratories, the, library, was, inadequate, the, faculty, contained, few, noted, scholars, what, made, the, place, special, he, writes, was, the, student, body, that, had, fought, so, hard, to, get, there, driven, by, their, parents, from, these, ranks, of, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, emerged, a, wealth, of, intellectual, talent, including, more, nobel, prize, winners, eight, and, phd, recipients, than, any, other, public, college, except, the, university, of, california, at, berkeley, salk, entered, ccny, at, the, age, of, 15, a, common, age, for, a, freshman, who, had, skipped, multiple, grades, along, the, way, 98, as, a, child, salk, did, not, show, any, interest, in, medicine, or, science, in, general, he, said, in, an, interview, with, the, academy, of, achievement, as, a, child, i, was, not, interested, in, science, i, was, merely, interested, in, things, human, the, human, side, of, nature, if, you, like, and, i, continue, to, be, interested, in, that, after, graduating, from, city, college, of, new, york, salk, enrolled, in, new, york, university, school, of, medicine, according, to, oshinsky, nyu, based, its, modest, reputation, on, famous, alumni, such, as, walter, reed, who, helped, conquer, yellow, fever, tuition, was, comparatively, low, better, still, it, did, not, discriminate, against, jews, while, most, of, the, surrounding, medical, schools, cornell, columbia, university, of, pennsylvania, and, yale, had, rigid, quotas, in, place, yale, for, example, accepted, 76, applicants, in, 1935, out, of, a, pool, of, 501, although, 200, of, the, applicants, were, jewish, only, five, got, in, 98, during, his, years, at, new, york, university, medical, school, salk, worked, as, a, laboratory, technician, during, the, school, year, and, as, a, camp, counselor, in, the, summer, during, salk, s, medical, studies, he, stood, out, from, his, peers, according, to, bookchin, not, just, because, of, his, continued, academic, prowess, he, was, alpha, omega, alpha, the, phi, beta, kappa, society, of, medical, education, but, because, he, had, decided, he, did, not, want, to, practice, medicine, instead, he, became, absorbed, in, research, even, taking, a, year, off, to, study, biochemistry, he, later, focused, more, of, his, studies, on, bacteriology, which, had, replaced, medicine, as, his, primary, interest, he, said, his, desire, was, to, help, humankind, in, general, rather, than, single, patients, it, was, the, laboratory, work, in, particular, that, gave, new, direction, to, his, life, salk, has, said, my, intention, was, to, go, to, medical, school, and, then, become, a, medical, scientist, i, did, not, intend, to, practice, medicine, although, in, medical, school, and, in, my, internship, i, did, all, the, things, that, were, necessary, to, qualify, me, in, that, regard, i, had, opportunities, along, the, way, to, drop, the, idea, of, medicine, and, go, into, science, at, one, point, at, the, end, of, my, first, year, of, medical, school, i, received, an, opportunity, to, spend, a, year, in, research, and, teaching, in, biochemistry, which, i, did, and, at, the, end, of, that, year, i, was, told, that, i, could, if, i, wished, switch, and, get, a, ph, d, in, biochemistry, but, my, preference, was, to, stay, with, medicine, and, i, believe, that, this, is, all, linked, to, my, original, ambition, or, desire, which, was, to, be, of, some, help, to, humankind, so, to, speak, in, a, larger, sense, than, just, on, a, one, to, one, basis, in, his, last, year, of, medical, school, salk, said, i, had, an, opportunity, to, spend, time, in, elective, periods, in, my, last, year, in, medical, school, in, a, laboratory, that, was, involved, in, studies, on, influenza, the, influenza, virus, had, just, been, discovered, about, a, few, years, before, that, and, i, saw, the, opportunity, at, that, time, to, test, the, question, as, to, whether, we, could, destroy, the, virus, infectivity, and, still, immunize, and, so, by, carefully, designed, experiments, we, found, it, was, possible, to, do, so, in, 1941, during, his, postgraduate, work, in, virology, salk, chose, a, two, month, elective, to, work, in, the, thomas, francis, laboratory, at, the, university, of, michigan, francis, had, recently, joined, the, faculty, of, the, medical, school, after, working, for, the, rockefeller, foundation, where, he, had, discovered, the, type, b, influenza, virus, according, to, bookchin, the, two, month, stint, in, francis, s, lab, was, salk, s, first, introduction, to, the, world, of, virology, and, he, was, hooked, 25, after, graduating, from, medical, school, salk, began, his, residency, at, new, york, s, prestigious, mount, sinai, hospital, where, he, again, worked, in, francis, s, laboratory, salk, then, worked, at, the, university, of, michigan, school, of, public, health, with, francis, on, an, army, commissioned, project, in, michigan, to, develop, an, influenza, vaccine, he, and, francis, eventually, perfected, a, vaccine, that, was, soon, widely, used, at, army, bases, where, salk, discovered, and, isolated, one, of, the, strains, of, influenza, that, was, included, in, the, final, vaccine, 26, in, 1947, salk, became, ambitious, for, his, own, lab, and, was, granted, one, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, school, of, medicine, but, the, lab, was, smaller, than, he, had, hoped, and, he, found, the, rules, imposed, by, the, university, restrictive, in, 1948, harry, weaver, the, director, of, research, at, the, national, foundation, for, infantile, paralysis, contacted, salk, he, asked, salk, to, find, out, if, there, were, more, types, of, polio, than, the, three, then, known, and, offered, additional, space, equipment, and, researchers, for, the, first, year, he, gathered, supplies, and, researchers, including, julius, youngner, byron, bennett, l, james, lewis, and, secretary, lorraine, friedman, who, joined, salk, s, team, as, well, as, time, went, on, salk, began, securing, grants, from, the, mellon, family, and, was, able, to, build, a, working, virology, laboratory, he, later, joined, the, national, foundation, for, infantile, paralysis, s, polio, project, established, by, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, extensive, publicity, and, fear, of, polio, led, to, much, increased, funding, reaching, 67, million, by, 1955, despite, the, funding, research, continued, on, live, vaccines, 85, 87, salk, decided, to, use, what, he, believed, to, be, the, safer, killed, virus, instead, of, weakened, forms, of, strains, of, polio, viruses, like, the, ones, used, contemporaneously, by, albert, sabin, who, was, developing, an, oral, vaccine, after, successful, tests, on, laboratory, animals, on, july, 2, 1952, assisted, by, the, staff, at, the, d, t, watson, home, for, crippled, children, which, is, now, the, education, center, at, the, watson, institute, in, sewickley, pennsylvania, salk, injected, 43, children, with, his, killed, virus, vaccine, a, few, weeks, later, salk, injected, children, at, the, polk, state, school, for, the, retarded, and, feeble, minded, he, vaccinated, his, own, children, in, 1953, in, 1954, he, tested, the, vaccine, on, about, one, million, children, known, as, the, polio, pioneers, the, vaccine, was, announced, as, safe, on, april, 12, 1955, the, project, became, large, involving, 100, million, contributors, to, the, march, of, dimes, and, 7, million, volunteers, 54, the, foundation, allowed, itself, to, go, into, debt, to, finance, the, final, research, required, to, develop, the, salk, vaccine, salk, worked, incessantly, for, two, and, a, half, years, salk, s, inactivated, polio, vaccine, came, into, use, in, 1955, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, salk, preferred, not, to, have, his, career, as, a, scientist, affected, by, too, much, personal, attention, as, he, had, always, tried, to, remain, independent, and, private, in, his, research, and, life, but, this, proved, to, be, impossible, young, man, a, great, tragedy, has, befallen, you, you, ve, lost, your, anonymity, the, television, personality, ed, murrow, said, to, salk, shortly, after, the, onslaught, of, media, attention, when, murrow, asked, him, who, owns, this, patent, salk, replied, well, the, people, i, would, say, there, is, no, patent, could, you, patent, the, sun, the, vaccine, is, calculated, to, be, worth, 7, billion, had, it, been, patented, however, lawyers, from, the, national, foundation, for, infantile, paralysis, did, look, into, the, possibility, of, a, patent, but, ultimately, determined, that, the, vaccine, was, not, a, patentable, invention, because, of, prior, art, salk, served, on, the, board, of, directors, of, the, john, d, and, catherine, t, macarthur, foundation, author, jon, cohen, noted, jonas, salk, made, scientists, and, journalists, alike, go, goofy, as, one, of, the, only, living, scientists, whose, face, was, known, the, world, over, salk, in, the, public, s, eye, had, a, superstar, aura, airplane, pilots, would, announce, that, he, was, on, board, and, passengers, would, burst, into, applause, hotels, routinely, would, upgrade, him, into, their, penthouse, suites, a, meal, at, a, restaurant, inevitably, meant, an, interruption, from, an, admirer, scientists, and, journalists, who, regularly, dealt, with, salk, would, come, to, see, him, in, more, human, terms, but, many, still, initially, approached, him, with, the, same, drop, jawed, wonder, as, though, some, of, the, stardust, might, rub, off, for, the, most, part, salk, was, appalled, at, the, demands, on, the, public, figure, he, has, become, and, resentful, of, what, he, considers, to, be, the, invasion, of, his, privacy, wrote, the, new, york, times, a, few, months, after, his, vaccine, announcement, the, times, article, noted, at, 40, the, once, obscure, scientist, was, lifted, from, his, laboratory, almost, to, the, level, of, a, folk, hero, he, received, a, presidential, citation, a, score, of, awards, four, honorary, degrees, half, a, dozen, foreign, decorations, and, letters, from, thousands, of, fellow, citizens, his, alma, mater, city, college, of, new, york, gave, him, an, honorary, degree, as, doctor, of, laws, but, despite, such, very, nice, tributes, the, new, york, times, wrote, salk, is, profoundly, disturbed, by, the, torrent, of, fame, that, has, descended, upon, him, he, talks, continually, about, getting, out, of, the, limelight, and, back, to, his, laboratory, because, of, his, genuine, distaste, for, publicity, which, he, believes, is, inappropriate, for, a, scientist, during, a, 1980, interview, 25, years, later, he, said, it, s, as, if, i, ve, been, a, public, property, ever, since, having, to, respond, to, external, as, well, as, internal, impulses, it, s, brought, me, enormous, gratification, opened, many, opportunities, but, at, the, same, time, placed, many, burdens, on, me, it, altered, my, career, my, relationships, with, colleagues, i, am, a, public, figure, no, longer, one, of, them, if, salk, the, scientist, sounds, austere, wrote, the, new, york, times, salk, the, man, is, a, person, of, great, warmth, and, tremendous, enthusiasm, people, who, meet, him, generally, like, him, a, washington, newspaper, correspondent, commented, he, could, sell, me, the, brooklyn, bridge, and, i, never, bought, anything, before, geneticist, walter, nelson, rees, called, him, a, renaissance, scientist, brilliant, sophisticated, driven, a, fantastic, creature, 127, he, enjoys, talking, to, people, he, likes, and, he, likes, a, lot, of, people, wrote, the, times, he, talks, quickly, articulately, and, often, in, complete, paragraphs, and, he, has, very, little, perceptible, interest, in, the, things, that, interest, most, people, such, as, making, money, that, belongs, in, the, category, of, mink, coats, and, cadillacs, unnecessary, he, said, in, the, years, after, salk, s, discovery, many, supporters, in, particular, the, national, foundation, helped, him, build, his, dream, of, a, research, complex, for, the, investigation, of, biological, phenomena, from, cell, to, society, called, the, salk, institute, for, biological, studies, it, opened, in, 1963, in, the, san, diego, neighborhood, of, la, jolla, in, a, purpose, built, facility, designed, by, the, architect, louis, kahn, salk, believed, that, the, institution, would, help, new, and, upcoming, scientists, along, in, their, careers, as, he, said, himself, i, thought, how, nice, it, would, be, if, a, place, like, this, existed, and, i, was, invited, to, work, there, in, 1966, salk, described, his, ambitious, plan, for, the, creation, of, a, kind, of, socratic, academy, where, the, supposedly, alienated, two, cultures, of, science, and, humanism, will, have, a, favorable, atmosphere, for, cross, fertilization, author, and, journalist, howard, taubman, explained, although, he, is, distinctly, future, oriented, dr, salk, has, not, lost, sight, of, the, institute, s, immediate, aim, which, is, the, development, and, use, of, the, new, biology, called, molecular, and, cellular, biology, described, as, part, physics, part, chemistry, and, part, biology, the, broad, gauged, purpose, of, this, science, is, to, understand, man, s, life, processes, there, is, talk, here, of, the, possibility, once, the, secret, of, how, the, cell, is, triggered, to, manufacture, antibodies, is, discovered, that, a, single, vaccine, may, be, developed, to, protect, a, child, against, many, common, infectious, diseases, there, is, speculation, about, the, power, to, isolate, and, perhaps, eliminate, genetic, errors, that, lead, to, birth, defects, dr, salk, a, creative, man, himself, hopes, that, the, institute, will, do, its, share, in, probing, the, wisdom, of, nature, and, thus, help, enlarge, the, wisdom, of, man, for, the, ultimate, purpose, of, science, humanism, and, the, arts, in, his, judgment, is, the, freeing, of, each, individual, to, cultivate, his, full, creativity, in, whichever, direction, it, leads, as, if, to, prepare, for, socratic, encounters, such, as, these, the, institute, s, architect, louis, kahn, has, installed, blackboards, in, place, of, concrete, facings, on, the, walls, along, the, walks, the, new, york, times, in, a, 1980, article, celebrating, the, 25th, anniversary, of, the, salk, vaccine, described, the, current, workings, at, the, facility, reporting, at, the, institute, a, magnificent, complex, of, laboratories, and, study, units, set, on, a, bluff, overlooking, the, pacific, dr, salk, holds, the, titles, of, founding, director, and, resident, fellow, his, own, laboratory, group, is, concerned, with, the, immunologic, aspects, of, cancer, and, the, mechanisms, of, autoimmune, disease, such, as, multiple, sclerosis, in, which, the, immune, system, attacks, the, body, s, own, tissues, in, an, interview, about, his, future, hopes, at, the, institute, he, said, in, the, end, what, may, have, more, significance, is, my, creation, of, the, institute, and, what, will, come, out, of, it, because, of, its, example, as, a, place, for, excellence, a, creative, environment, for, creative, minds, francis, crick, co, discoverer, of, the, structure, of, the, dna, molecule, was, a, leading, professor, at, the, institute, until, his, death, in, 2004, the, institute, also, served, as, the, basis, for, bruno, latour, and, steve, woolgar, s, 1979, book, laboratory, life, the, construction, of, scientific, facts, beginning, in, the, mid, 1980s, salk, engaged, in, research, to, develop, a, vaccine, for, aids, he, cofounded, the, immune, response, corporation, irc, with, kevin, kimberlin, and, patented, remune, an, immunologic, therapy, but, was, unable, to, secure, liability, insurance, for, the, product, the, project, was, discontinued, in, 2007, twelve, years, after, salk, s, death, in, 1966, the, new, york, times, referred, to, him, as, the, father, of, biophilosophy, according, to, times, journalist, and, author, howard, taubman, he, never, forgets, there, is, a, vast, amount, of, darkness, for, man, to, penetrate, as, a, biologist, he, believes, that, his, science, is, on, the, frontier, of, tremendous, new, discoveries, and, as, a, philosopher, he, is, convinced, that, humanists, and, artists, have, joined, the, scientists, to, achieve, an, understanding, of, man, in, all, his, physical, mental, and, spiritual, complexity, such, interchanges, might, lead, he, would, hope, to, a, new, and, important, school, of, thinkers, he, would, designate, as, biophilosophers, salk, told, his, cousin, joel, kassiday, at, a, meeting, of, the, congressional, clearinghouse, on, the, future, on, capitol, hill, in, 1984, that, he, was, optimistic, that, ways, to, prevent, most, human, and, animal, diseases, would, eventually, be, developed, salk, said, people, must, be, prepared, to, take, prudent, risks, since, a, risk, free, society, would, become, a, dead, end, society, without, progress, salk, describes, his, biophilosophy, as, the, application, of, a, biological, evolutionary, point, of, view, to, philosophical, cultural, social, and, psychological, problems, he, went, into, more, detail, in, two, of, his, books, man, unfolding, and, the, survival, of, the, wisest, in, an, interview, in, 1980, he, described, his, thoughts, on, the, subject, including, his, feeling, that, a, sharp, rise, and, an, expected, leveling, off, in, the, human, population, would, take, place, and, eventually, bring, a, change, in, human, attitudes, i, think, of, biological, knowledge, as, providing, useful, analogies, for, understanding, human, nature, people, think, of, biology, in, terms, of, such, practical, matters, as, drugs, but, its, contribution, to, knowledge, about, living, systems, and, ourselves, will, in, the, future, be, equally, important, in, the, past, epoch, man, was, concerned, with, death, high, mortality, his, attitudes, were, antideath, antidisease, he, says, in, the, future, his, attitudes, will, be, expressed, in, terms, of, prolife, and, prohealth, the, past, was, dominated, by, death, control, in, the, future, birth, control, will, be, more, important, these, changes, we, re, observing, are, part, of, a, natural, order, and, to, be, expected, from, our, capacity, to, adapt, it, s, much, more, important, to, cooperate, and, collaborate, we, are, the, co, authors, with, nature, of, our, destiny, his, definition, of, a, biophilosopher, is, someone, who, draws, upon, the, scriptures, of, nature, recognizing, that, we, are, the, product, of, the, process, of, evolution, and, understands, that, we, have, become, the, process, itself, through, the, emergence, and, evolution, of, our, consciousness, our, awareness, our, capacity, to, imagine, and, anticipate, the, future, and, to, choose, from, among, alternatives, just, prior, to, his, death, salk, was, working, on, a, new, book, along, the, theme, of, biophilosophy, privately, reported, to, be, titled, millennium, of, the, mind, the, day, after, his, graduation, from, medical, school, in, 1939, salk, married, donna, lindsay, a, master, s, candidate, at, the, new, york, college, of, social, work, david, oshinsky, writes, that, donna, s, father, elmer, lindsay, a, wealthy, manhattan, dentist, viewed, salk, as, a, social, inferior, several, cuts, below, donna, s, former, suitors, eventually, her, father, agreed, to, the, marriage, on, two, conditions, first, salk, must, wait, until, he, could, be, listed, as, an, official, m, d, on, the, wedding, invitations, and, second, he, must, improve, his, rather, pedestrian, status, by, giving, himself, a, middle, name, 99, they, had, three, children, peter, who, also, became, a, physician, and, a, part, time, professor, of, infectious, diseases, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, darrell, who, also, worked, with, vaccines, and, genetics, and, eventually, retired, from, the, pediatrics, faculty, at, the, university, of, washington, school, of, medicine, and, jonathan, salk, an, adult, and, child, psychiatrist, and, assistant, clinical, professor, at, the, david, geffen, school, of, medicine, at, ucla, in, 1968, they, divorced,
