claude, l, vi, strauss, k, l, d, l, e, v, i, s, t, r, a, s, klawd, lay, vee, strowss, french, 28, november, 1908, 30, october, 2009, was, a, french, anthropologist, and, ethnologist, whose, work, was, key, in, the, development, of, the, theories, of, structuralism, and, structural, anthropology, he, held, the, chair, of, social, anthropology, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, between, 1959, and, 1982, was, elected, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, 1973, and, was, a, member, of, the, school, for, advanced, studies, in, the, social, sciences, in, paris, he, received, numerous, honors, from, universities, and, institutions, throughout, the, world, l, vi, strauss, argued, that, the, savage, mind, had, the, same, structures, as, the, civilized, mind, and, that, human, characteristics, are, the, same, everywhere, these, observations, culminated, in, his, famous, book, tristes, tropiques, 1955, which, established, his, position, as, one, of, the, central, figures, in, the, structuralist, school, of, thought, as, well, as, sociology, his, ideas, reached, into, many, fields, in, the, humanities, including, philosophy, structuralism, has, been, defined, as, the, search, for, the, underlying, patterns, of, thought, in, all, forms, of, human, activity, he, won, the, 1986, international, nonino, prize, in, italy, gustave, claude, l, vi, strauss, was, born, in, 1908, to, french, jewish, turned, agnostic, parents, who, were, living, in, brussels, where, his, father, was, working, as, a, portrait, painter, at, the, time, he, grew, up, in, paris, living, on, a, street, of, the, upscale, 16th, arrondissement, named, after, the, artist, claude, lorrain, whose, work, he, admired, and, later, wrote, about, during, the, first, world, war, from, age, 6, to, 10, he, lived, with, his, maternal, grandfather, who, was, the, rabbi, of, versailles, despite, his, religious, environment, early, on, claude, l, vi, strauss, was, an, atheist, or, agnostic, at, least, in, his, adult, life, from, 1918, to, 1925, he, studied, at, lyc, e, janson, de, sailly, high, school, receiving, a, baccalaureate, in, june, 1925, age, of, 16, in, his, last, year, 1924, he, was, introduced, to, philosophy, including, the, works, of, marx, and, kant, and, began, shifting, to, the, political, left, however, unlike, many, other, socialists, he, never, became, communist, from, 1925, he, spent, the, next, two, years, at, the, prestigious, lyc, e, condorcet, preparing, for, the, entrance, exam, to, the, highly, selective, cole, normale, sup, rieure, however, for, reasons, that, are, not, entirely, clear, he, decided, not, to, take, the, exam, in, 1926, he, went, to, sorbonne, in, paris, studying, law, and, philosophy, as, well, as, engaging, in, socialist, politics, and, activism, in, 1929, he, opted, for, philosophy, over, law, which, he, found, boring, and, from, 1930, to, 1931, put, politics, aside, to, focus, on, preparing, for, the, agr, gation, in, philosophy, in, order, to, qualify, as, a, professor, in, 1931, he, passed, the, agr, gation, coming, in, 3rd, place, and, youngest, in, his, class, at, age, 22, by, this, time, the, great, depression, had, hit, france, and, l, vi, strauss, found, himself, needing, to, provide, not, only, for, himself, but, his, parents, as, well, in, 1935, after, a, few, years, of, secondary, school, teaching, he, took, up, a, last, minute, offer, to, be, part, of, a, french, cultural, mission, to, brazil, in, which, he, would, serve, as, a, visiting, professor, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, s, o, paulo, while, his, then, wife, dina, served, as, a, visiting, professor, of, ethnology, the, couple, lived, and, did, their, anthropological, work, in, brazil, from, 1935, to, 1939, during, this, time, while, he, was, a, visiting, professor, of, sociology, claude, undertook, his, only, ethnographic, fieldwork, he, accompanied, dina, a, trained, ethnographer, in, her, own, right, who, was, also, a, visiting, professor, at, the, university, of, s, o, paulo, where, they, conducted, research, forays, into, the, mato, grosso, and, the, amazon, rainforest, they, first, studied, the, guaycuru, and, boror, indian, tribes, staying, among, them, for, a, few, days, in, 1938, they, returned, for, a, second, more, than, half, year, long, expedition, to, study, the, nambikwara, and, tupi, kawahib, societies, at, this, time, his, wife, had, an, eye, infection, that, prevented, her, from, completing, the, study, which, he, concluded, this, experience, cemented, l, vi, strauss, s, professional, identity, as, an, anthropologist, edmund, leach, suggests, from, l, vi, strauss, s, own, accounts, in, tristes, tropiques, that, he, could, not, have, spent, more, than, a, few, weeks, in, any, one, place, and, was, never, able, to, converse, easily, with, any, of, his, native, informants, in, their, native, language, which, is, uncharacteristic, of, anthropological, research, methods, of, participatory, interaction, with, subjects, to, gain, a, full, understanding, of, a, culture, in, the, 1980s, he, discussed, why, he, became, vegetarian, in, pieces, published, in, italian, daily, newspaper, la, repubblica, and, other, publications, anthologized, in, the, posthumous, book, nous, sommes, tous, des, cannibales, 2013, a, day, will, come, when, the, thought, that, to, feed, themselves, men, of, the, past, raised, and, massacred, living, beings, and, complacently, exposed, their, shredded, flesh, in, displays, shall, no, doubt, inspire, the, same, repulsion, as, that, of, the, travellers, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, facing, cannibal, meals, of, savage, american, primitives, in, america, oceania, asia, or, africa, l, vi, strauss, returned, to, france, in, 1939, to, take, part, in, the, war, effort, and, was, assigned, as, a, liaison, agent, to, the, maginot, line, after, the, french, capitulation, in, 1940, he, was, employed, at, a, lyc, e, in, montpellier, but, then, was, dismissed, under, the, vichy, racial, laws, l, vi, strauss, s, family, originally, from, alsace, was, of, jewish, ancestry, around, that, time, he, and, his, first, wife, separated, she, stayed, behind, and, worked, in, the, french, resistance, while, he, managed, to, escape, vichy, france, by, boat, to, martinique, from, where, he, was, finally, able, to, continue, travelling, victor, serge, describes, conversations, with, l, vi, strauss, aboard, the, freighter, capitaine, paul, lemerle, from, marseilles, to, martinique, in, his, notebooks, in, 1941, he, was, offered, a, position, at, the, new, school, for, social, research, in, new, york, city, and, granted, admission, to, the, united, states, a, series, of, voyages, brought, him, via, south, america, to, puerto, rico, where, he, was, investigated, by, the, fbi, after, german, letters, in, his, luggage, aroused, the, suspicions, of, customs, agents, l, vi, strauss, spent, most, of, the, war, in, new, york, city, along, with, jacques, maritain, henri, focillon, and, roman, jakobson, he, was, a, founding, member, of, the, cole, libre, des, hautes, tudes, a, sort, of, university, in, exile, for, french, academics, the, war, years, in, new, york, were, formative, for, l, vi, strauss, in, several, ways, his, relationship, with, jakobson, helped, shape, his, theoretical, outlook, jakobson, and, l, vi, strauss, are, considered, to, be, two, of, the, central, figures, on, which, structuralist, thought, is, based, in, addition, l, vi, strauss, was, also, exposed, to, the, american, anthropology, espoused, by, franz, boas, who, taught, at, columbia, university, in, 1942, while, having, dinner, at, the, faculty, house, at, columbia, boas, died, in, l, vi, strauss, s, arms, this, intimate, association, with, boas, gave, his, early, work, a, distinctive, american, inclination, that, helped, facilitate, its, acceptance, in, the, u, s, it, is, noteworthy, that, he, received, none, of, the, medals, and, honours, usually, awarded, to, resistants, let, alone, created, compagnon, de, la, lib, ration, after, a, brief, stint, from, 1946, to, 1947, as, a, cultural, attach, to, the, french, embassy, in, washington, dc, l, vi, strauss, returned, to, paris, in, 1948, at, this, time, he, received, his, state, doctorate, from, the, sorbonne, by, submitting, in, the, french, tradition, both, a, major, and, a, minor, doctoral, thesis, these, were, la, vie, familiale, et, sociale, des, indiens, nambikwara, the, family, and, social, life, of, the, nambikwara, indians, and, les, structures, l, mentaires, de, la, parent, the, elementary, structures, of, kinship, 234, in, 2008, he, became, the, first, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, to, reach, the, age, of, 100, and, one, of, the, few, living, authors, to, have, his, works, published, in, the, biblioth, que, de, la, pl, iade, on, the, death, of, maurice, druon, on, 14, april, 2009, he, became, the, dean, of, the, acad, mie, its, longest, serving, member, he, died, on, 30, october, 2009, at, age, 100, the, death, was, announced, four, days, later, french, president, nicolas, sarkozy, described, him, as, one, of, the, greatest, ethnologists, of, all, time, bernard, kouchner, the, french, foreign, minister, said, l, vi, strauss, broke, with, an, ethnocentric, vision, of, history, and, humanity, at, a, time, when, we, are, trying, to, give, meaning, to, globalization, to, build, a, fairer, and, more, humane, world, i, would, like, claude, l, vi, strauss, s, universal, echo, to, resonate, more, strongly, in, a, similar, vein, a, statement, by, l, vi, strauss, was, broadcast, on, national, public, radio, in, the, remembrance, produced, by, all, things, considered, on, 3, november, 2009, there, is, today, a, frightful, disappearance, of, living, species, be, they, plants, or, animals, and, it, s, clear, that, the, density, of, human, beings, has, become, so, great, if, i, can, say, so, that, they, have, begun, to, poison, themselves, and, the, world, which, i, am, finishing, my, existence, is, no, longer, a, world, that, i, like, the, daily, telegraph, said, in, its, obituary, that, l, vi, strauss, was, one, of, the, dominating, postwar, influences, in, french, intellectual, life, and, the, leading, exponent, of, structuralism, in, the, social, sciences, permanent, secretary, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, h, l, ne, carr, re, d, encausse, said, he, was, a, thinker, a, philosopher, we, will, not, find, another, like, him, the, elementary, structures, of, kinship, was, published, in, 1949, and, quickly, came, to, be, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, anthropological, works, on, kinship, it, was, even, reviewed, favorably, by, simone, de, beauvoir, who, saw, it, as, an, important, statement, of, the, position, of, women, in, non, western, cultures, a, play, on, the, title, of, durkheim, s, famous, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, l, vi, strauss, elementary, structures, re, examined, how, people, organized, their, families, by, examining, the, logical, structures, that, underlay, relationships, rather, than, their, contents, while, british, anthropologists, such, as, alfred, reginald, radcliffe, brown, argued, that, kinship, was, based, on, descent, from, a, common, ancestor, l, vi, strauss, argued, that, kinship, was, based, on, the, alliance, between, two, families, that, formed, when, women, from, one, group, married, men, from, another, throughout, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, l, vi, strauss, continued, to, publish, and, experienced, considerable, professional, success, on, his, return, to, france, he, became, involved, with, the, administration, of, the, cnrs, and, the, mus, e, de, l, homme, before, finally, becoming, a, professor, directeur, d, tudes, of, the, fifth, section, of, the, cole, pratique, des, hautes, tudes, the, religious, sciences, section, where, marcel, mauss, was, previously, professor, the, title, of, which, chair, he, renamed, comparative, religion, of, non, literate, peoples, while, l, vi, strauss, was, well, known, in, academic, circles, in, 1955, he, became, one, of, france, s, best, known, intellectuals, by, publishing, tristes, tropiques, in, paris, that, year, by, plon, best, known, translated, into, english, in, 1973, published, by, penguin, essentially, this, book, was, a, memoir, detailing, his, time, as, a, french, expatriate, throughout, the, 1930s, and, his, travels, l, vi, strauss, combined, exquisitely, beautiful, prose, dazzling, philosophical, meditation, and, ethnographic, analysis, of, the, amazonian, peoples, to, produce, a, masterpiece, the, organizers, of, the, prix, goncourt, for, instance, lamented, that, they, were, not, able, to, award, l, vi, strauss, the, prize, because, tristes, tropiques, was, nonfiction, l, vi, strauss, was, named, to, a, chair, in, social, anthropology, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, 1959, at, roughly, the, same, time, he, published, structural, anthropology, a, collection, of, his, essays, that, provided, both, examples, and, programmatic, statements, about, structuralism, at, the, same, time, as, he, was, laying, the, groundwork, for, an, intellectual, program, he, began, a, series, of, institutions, to, establish, anthropology, as, a, discipline, in, france, including, the, laboratory, for, social, anthropology, where, new, students, could, be, trained, and, a, new, journal, l, homme, for, publishing, the, results, of, their, research, in, 1962, l, vi, strauss, published, what, is, for, many, people, his, most, important, work, la, pens, e, sauvage, translated, into, english, as, the, savage, mind, and, later, as, wild, thought, the, french, title, is, an, untranslatable, pun, as, the, word, pens, e, means, both, thought, and, pansy, while, sauvage, has, a, range, of, meanings, different, from, english, savage, l, vi, strauss, supposedly, suggested, that, the, english, title, be, pansies, for, thought, borrowing, from, a, speech, by, ophelia, in, shakespeare, s, hamlet, act, iv, scene, v, french, editions, of, la, pens, e, sauvage, are, often, printed, with, an, image, of, wild, pansies, on, the, cover, the, savage, mind, discusses, not, just, primitive, thought, a, category, defined, by, previous, anthropologists, but, also, forms, of, thought, common, to, all, human, beings, the, first, half, of, the, book, lays, out, l, vi, strauss, s, theory, of, culture, and, mind, while, the, second, half, expands, this, account, into, a, theory, of, history, and, social, change, this, latter, part, of, the, book, engaged, l, vi, strauss, in, a, heated, debate, with, jean, paul, sartre, over, the, nature, of, human, freedom, on, the, one, hand, sartre, s, existentialist, philosophy, committed, him, to, a, position, that, human, beings, fundamentally, were, free, to, act, as, they, pleased, on, the, other, hand, sartre, also, was, a, leftist, who, was, committed, to, ideas, such, as, that, individuals, were, constrained, by, the, ideologies, imposed, on, them, by, the, powerful, l, vi, strauss, presented, his, structuralist, notion, of, agency, in, opposition, to, sartre, echoes, of, this, debate, between, structuralism, and, existentialism, eventually, inspired, the, work, of, younger, authors, such, as, pierre, bourdieu, now, a, worldwide, celebrity, l, vi, strauss, spent, the, second, half, of, the, 1960s, working, on, his, master, project, a, four, volume, study, called, mythologiques, in, it, he, followed, a, single, myth, from, the, tip, of, south, america, and, all, of, its, variations, from, group, to, group, north, through, central, america, and, eventually, into, the, arctic, circle, thus, tracing, the, myth, s, cultural, evolution, from, one, end, of, the, western, hemisphere, to, the, other, he, accomplished, this, in, a, typically, structuralist, way, examining, the, underlying, structure, of, relationships, among, the, elements, of, the, story, rather, than, focusing, on, the, content, of, the, story, itself, while, pens, e, sauvage, was, a, statement, of, l, vi, strauss, s, big, picture, theory, mythologiques, was, an, extended, four, volume, example, of, analysis, richly, detailed, and, extremely, long, it, is, less, widely, read, than, the, much, shorter, and, more, accessible, pens, e, sauvage, despite, its, position, as, l, vi, strauss, s, masterwork, l, vi, strauss, completed, the, final, volume, of, mythologiques, in, 1971, on, 14, may, 1973, he, was, elected, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, france, s, highest, honour, for, a, writer, he, was, a, member, of, other, notable, academies, worldwide, including, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, letters, in, 1956, he, became, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, he, then, became, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1960, and, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1967, he, received, the, erasmus, prize, in, 1973, the, meister, eckhart, prize, for, philosophy, in, 2003, and, several, honorary, doctorates, from, universities, such, as, oxford, harvard, yale, and, columbia, he, also, was, the, recipient, of, the, grand, croix, de, la, l, gion, d, honneur, was, a, commandeur, de, l, ordre, national, du, m, rite, and, commandeur, des, arts, et, des, lettres, in, 2005, he, received, the, xvii, premi, internacional, catalunya, generalitat, of, catalonia, after, his, retirement, he, continued, to, publish, occasional, meditations, on, art, music, philosophy, and, poetry, l, vi, strauss, sought, to, apply, the, structural, linguistics, of, ferdinand, de, saussure, to, anthropology, at, the, time, the, family, was, traditionally, considered, the, fundamental, object, of, analysis, but, was, seen, primarily, as, a, self, contained, unit, consisting, of, a, husband, a, wife, and, their, children, nephews, cousins, aunts, uncles, and, grandparents, all, were, treated, as, secondary, l, vi, strauss, argued, that, akin, to, saussure, s, notion, of, linguistic, value, families, acquire, determinate, identities, only, through, relations, with, one, another, thus, he, inverted, the, classical, view, of, anthropology, putting, the, secondary, family, members, first, and, insisting, on, analyzing, the, relations, between, units, instead, of, the, units, themselves, in, his, own, analysis, of, the, formation, of, the, identities, that, arise, through, marriages, between, tribes, l, vi, strauss, noted, that, the, relation, between, the, uncle, and, the, nephew, was, to, the, relation, between, brother, and, sister, as, the, relation, between, father, and, son, is, to, that, between, husband, and, wife, that, is, a, is, to, b, as, c, is, to, d, therefore, if, we, know, a, b, and, c, we, can, predict, d, an, example, of, this, law, is, illustrated, in, the, diagram, the, four, relation, units, are, marked, with, a, to, d, l, vi, strauss, noted, that, if, a, is, positive, b, is, negative, and, c, is, negative, then, it, can, inferred, that, d, is, positive, thereby, satisfying, the, constraint, a, is, to, b, as, c, is, to, d, in, this, case, the, relations, are, contrasting, the, goal, of, l, vi, strauss, s, structural, anthropology, then, was, to, simplify, the, masses, of, empirical, data, into, generalized, comprehensible, relations, between, units, which, allow, for, predictive, laws, to, be, identified, such, as, a, is, to, b, as, c, is, to, d, l, vi, strauss, s, theory, is, set, forth, in, structural, anthropology, 1958, briefly, he, considers, culture, a, system, of, symbolic, communication, to, be, investigated, with, methods, that, others, have, used, more, narrowly, in, the, discussion, of, novels, political, speeches, sports, and, movies, his, reasoning, makes, the, best, sense, when, contrasted, against, the, background, of, an, earlier, generation, s, social, theory, he, wrote, about, this, relationship, for, decades, a, preference, for, functionalist, explanations, dominated, the, social, sciences, from, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, through, the, 1950s, which, is, to, say, that, anthropologists, and, sociologists, tried, to, state, the, purpose, of, a, social, act, or, institution, the, existence, of, a, thing, was, explained, if, it, fulfilled, a, function, the, only, strong, alternative, to, that, kind, of, analysis, was, a, historical, explanation, accounting, for, the, existence, of, a, social, fact, by, stating, how, it, came, to, be, the, idea, of, social, function, developed, in, two, different, ways, however, the, english, anthropologist, alfred, reginald, radcliffe, brown, who, had, read, and, admired, the, work, of, the, french, sociologist, mile, durkheim, argued, that, the, goal, of, anthropological, research, was, to, find, the, collective, function, such, as, what, a, religious, creed, or, a, set, of, rules, about, marriage, did, for, the, social, order, as, a, whole, behind, this, approach, was, an, old, idea, the, view, that, civilization, developed, through, a, series, of, phases, from, the, primitive, to, the, modern, everywhere, in, the, same, manner, all, of, the, activities, in, a, given, kind, of, society, would, partake, of, the, same, character, some, sort, of, internal, logic, would, cause, one, level, of, culture, to, evolve, into, the, next, on, this, view, a, society, can, easily, be, thought, of, as, an, organism, the, parts, functioning, together, as, do, the, parts, of, a, body, in, contrast, the, more, influential, functionalism, of, bronis, aw, malinowski, described, the, satisfaction, of, individual, needs, what, a, person, derived, by, participating, in, a, custom, in, the, united, states, where, the, shape, of, anthropology, was, set, by, the, german, educated, franz, boas, the, preference, was, for, historical, accounts, this, approach, had, obvious, problems, which, l, vi, strauss, praises, boas, for, facing, squarely, historical, information, seldom, is, available, for, non, literate, cultures, the, anthropologist, fills, in, with, comparisons, to, other, cultures, and, is, forced, to, rely, on, theories, that, have, no, evidential, basis, the, old, notion, of, universal, stages, of, development, or, the, claim, that, cultural, resemblances, are, based, on, some, unrecognized, past, contact, between, groups, boas, came, to, believe, that, no, overall, pattern, in, social, development, could, be, proven, for, him, there, was, no, single, history, only, histories, there, are, three, broad, choices, involved, in, the, divergence, of, these, schools, each, had, to, decide, social, scientists, in, all, traditions, relied, on, cross, cultural, studies, as, it, was, always, necessary, to, supplement, information, about, a, society, with, information, about, others, thus, some, idea, of, a, common, human, nature, was, implicit, in, each, approach, the, critical, distinction, then, remained, twofold, for, l, vi, strauss, the, choice, was, for, the, demands, of, the, social, order, he, had, no, difficulty, bringing, out, the, inconsistencies, and, triviality, of, individualistic, accounts, malinowski, said, for, example, that, magic, beliefs, come, into, being, when, people, need, to, feel, a, sense, of, control, over, events, when, the, outcome, is, uncertain, in, the, trobriand, islands, he, found, proof, of, this, claim, in, the, rites, surrounding, abortions, and, weaving, skirts, but, in, the, same, tribes, there, is, no, magic, attached, to, making, clay, pots, even, though, it, is, no, more, certain, a, business, than, weaving, so, the, explanation, is, not, consistent, furthermore, these, explanations, tend, to, be, used, in, an, ad, hoc, superficial, way, one, postulates, a, trait, of, personality, when, needed, however, the, accepted, way, of, discussing, organizational, function, did, not, work, either, different, societies, might, have, institutions, that, were, similar, in, many, obvious, ways, and, yet, served, different, functions, many, tribal, cultures, divide, the, tribe, into, two, groups, and, have, elaborate, rules, about, how, the, two, groups, may, interact, however, exactly, what, they, may, do, trade, intermarry, is, different, in, different, tribes, for, that, matter, so, are, the, criteria, for, distinguishing, the, groups, nor, will, it, do, to, say, that, dividing, in, two, is, a, universal, need, of, organizations, because, there, are, a, lot, of, tribes, that, thrive, without, it, for, l, vi, strauss, the, methods, of, linguistics, became, a, model, for, all, his, earlier, examinations, of, society, his, analogies, usually, are, from, phonology, though, also, later, from, music, mathematics, chaos, theory, cybernetics, and, so, on, a, really, scientific, analysis, must, be, real, simplifying, and, explanatory, he, writes, phonemic, analysis, reveals, features, that, are, real, in, the, sense, that, users, of, the, language, can, recognize, and, respond, to, them, at, the, same, time, a, phoneme, is, an, abstraction, from, language, not, a, sound, but, a, category, of, sound, defined, by, the, way, it, is, distinguished, from, other, categories, through, rules, unique, to, the, language, the, entire, sound, structure, of, a, language, may, be, generated, from, a, relatively, small, number, of, rules, in, the, study, of, the, kinship, systems, that, first, concerned, him, this, ideal, of, explanation, allowed, a, comprehensive, organization, of, data, that, partly, had, been, ordered, by, other, researchers, the, overall, goal, was, to, find, out, why, family, relations, differed, among, various, south, american, cultures, the, father, might, have, great, authority, over, the, son, in, one, group, for, example, with, the, relationship, rigidly, restricted, by, taboos, in, another, group, the, mother, s, brother, would, have, that, kind, of, relationship, with, the, son, while, the, father, s, relationship, was, relaxed, and, playful, a, number, of, partial, patterns, had, been, noted, relations, between, the, mother, and, father, for, example, had, some, sort, of, reciprocity, with, those, of, father, and, son, if, the, mother, had, a, dominant, social, status, and, was, formal, with, the, father, for, example, then, the, father, usually, had, close, relations, with, the, son, but, these, smaller, patterns, joined, in, inconsistent, ways, one, possible, way, of, finding, a, master, order, was, to, rate, all, the, positions, in, a, kinship, system, along, several, dimensions, for, example, the, father, was, older, than, the, son, the, father, produced, the, son, the, father, had, the, same, sex, as, the, son, and, so, on, the, matrilineal, uncle, was, older, and, of, the, same, sex, but, did, not, produce, the, son, and, so, on, an, exhaustive, collection, of, such, observations, might, cause, an, overall, pattern, to, emerge, however, for, l, vi, strauss, this, kind, of, work, was, considered, analytical, in, appearance, only, it, results, in, a, chart, that, is, far, more, difficult, to, understand, than, the, original, data, and, is, based, on, arbitrary, abstractions, empirically, fathers, are, older, than, sons, but, it, is, only, the, researcher, who, declares, that, this, feature, explains, their, relations, furthermore, it, does, not, explain, anything, the, explanation, it, offers, is, tautological, if, age, is, crucial, then, age, explains, a, relationship, and, it, does, not, offer, the, possibility, of, inferring, the, origins, of, the, structure, a, proper, solution, to, the, puzzle, is, to, find, a, basic, unit, of, kinship, which, can, explain, all, the, variations, it, is, a, cluster, of, four, roles, brother, sister, father, son, these, are, the, roles, that, must, be, involved, in, any, society, that, has, an, incest, taboo, requiring, a, man, to, obtain, a, wife, from, some, man, outside, his, own, hereditary, line, a, brother, may, give, away, his, sister, for, example, whose, son, might, reciprocate, in, the, next, generation, by, allowing, his, sister, to, marry, exogamously, the, underlying, demand, is, a, continued, circulation, of, women, to, keep, various, clans, peacefully, related, right, or, wrong, this, solution, displays, the, qualities, of, structural, thinking, even, though, l, vi, strauss, frequently, speaks, of, treating, culture, as, the, product, of, the, axioms, and, corollaries, that, underlie, it, or, the, phonemic, differences, that, constitute, it, he, is, concerned, with, the, objective, data, of, field, research, he, notes, that, it, is, logically, possible, for, a, different, atom, of, kinship, structure, to, exist, sister, sister, s, brother, brother, s, wife, daughter, but, there, are, no, real, world, examples, of, relationships, that, can, be, derived, from, that, grouping, the, trouble, with, this, view, has, been, shown, by, australian, anthropologist, augustus, elkin, who, insisted, on, the, point, that, in, a, four, class, marriage, system, the, preferred, marriage, was, with, a, classificatory, mother, s, brother, s, daughter, and, never, with, the, true, one, l, vi, strauss, s, atom, of, kinship, structure, deals, only, with, consanguineal, kin, there, is, a, big, difference, between, the, two, situations, in, that, the, kinship, structure, involving, the, classificatory, kin, relations, allows, for, the, building, of, a, system, which, can, bring, together, thousands, of, people, l, vi, strauss, s, atom, of, kinship, stops, working, once, the, true, mobrda, is, missing, l, vi, strauss, also, developed, the, concept, of, the, house, society, to, describe, those, societies, where, the, domestic, unit, is, more, central, to, the, social, organization, than, the, descent, group, or, lineage, the, purpose, of, structuralist, explanation, is, to, organize, real, data, in, the, simplest, effective, way, all, science, he, says, is, either, structuralist, or, reductionist, in, confronting, such, matters, as, the, incest, taboo, one, is, facing, an, objective, limit, of, what, the, human, mind, has, accepted, so, far, one, could, hypothesize, some, biological, imperative, underlying, it, but, so, far, as, social, order, is, concerned, the, taboo, has, the, effect, of, an, irreducible, fact, the, social, scientist, can, only, work, with, the, structures, of, human, thought, that, arise, from, it, and, structural, explanations, can, be, tested, and, refuted, a, mere, analytic, scheme, that, wishes, causal, relations, into, existence, is, not, structuralist, in, this, sense, l, vi, strauss, s, later, works, are, more, controversial, in, part, because, they, impinge, on, the, subject, matter, of, other, scholars, he, believed, that, modern, life, and, all, history, were, founded, on, the, same, categories, and, transformations, that, he, had, discovered, in, the, brazilian, backcountry, the, raw, and, the, cooked, from, honey, to, ashes, the, naked, man, to, borrow, some, titles, from, the, mythologiques, for, instance, he, compares, anthropology, to, musical, serialism, and, defends, his, philosophical, approach, he, also, pointed, out, that, the, modern, view, of, primitive, cultures, was, simplistic, in, denying, them, a, history, the, categories, of, myth, did, not, persist, among, them, because, nothing, had, happened, it, was, easy, to, find, the, evidence, of, defeat, migration, exile, and, repeated, displacements, of, all, the, kinds, known, to, recorded, history, instead, the, mythic, categories, had, encompassed, these, changes, he, argued, for, a, view, of, human, life, as, existing, in, two, timelines, simultaneously, the, eventful, one, of, history, and, the, long, cycles, in, which, one, set, of, fundamental, mythic, patterns, dominates, and, then, perhaps, another, in, this, respect, his, work, resembles, that, of, fernand, braudel, the, historian, of, the, mediterranean, and, la, longue, dur, e, the, cultural, outlook, and, forms, of, social, organization, that, persisted, for, centuries, around, that, sea, he, is, right, in, that, history, is, difficult, to, build, up, in, a, non, literate, society, nevertheless, jean, guiart, s, anthropological, and, jos, garanger, s, archaeological, work, in, central, vanuatu, bringing, to, the, fore, the, skeletons, of, former, chiefs, described, in, local, myths, who, had, thus, been, living, persons, shows, that, there, can, be, some, means, of, ascertaining, the, history, of, some, groups, which, otherwise, would, be, deemed, a, historical, another, issue, is, the, experience, that, the, same, person, can, tell, one, a, myth, highly, charged, in, symbols, and, some, years, later, a, sort, of, chronological, history, claiming, to, be, chronic, of, a, descent, line, e, g, in, the, loyalty, islands, and, new, zealand, the, two, texts, having, in, common, that, they, each, deal, in, topographical, detail, with, the, land, tenure, claims, of, the, said, descent, line, see, douglas, oliver, on, the, siwai, in, bougainville, l, vi, strauss, would, agree, to, these, aspects, be, explained, inside, his, seminar, but, would, never, touch, them, on, his, own, the, anthropological, data, content, of, the, myths, was, not, his, problem, he, was, only, interested, in, the, formal, aspects, of, each, story, considered, by, him, as, the, result, of, the, workings, of, the, collective, unconscious, of, each, group, which, idea, was, taken, from, the, linguists, but, cannot, be, proved, in, any, way, although, he, was, adamant, about, its, existence, and, would, never, accept, any, discussion, on, this, point, similar, to, his, anthropological, theories, l, vi, strauss, identified, myths, as, a, type, of, speech, through, which, a, language, could, be, discovered, his, work, is, a, structuralist, theory, of, mythology, which, attempted, to, explain, how, seemingly, fantastical, and, arbitrary, tales, could, be, so, similar, across, cultures, because, he, had, the, believe, that, there, was, no, one, authentic, version, of, a, myth, rather, that, they, were, all, manifestations, of, the, same, language, he, sought, to, find, the, fundamental, units, of, myth, namely, the, mytheme, l, vi, strauss, broke, each, of, the, versions, of, a, myth, down, into, a, series, of, sentences, consisting, of, a, relation, between, a, function, and, a, subject, sentences, with, the, same, function, were, given, the, same, number, and, bundled, together, these, are, mythemes, what, l, vi, strauss, believed, he, had, discovered, when, he, examined, the, relations, between, mythemes, was, that, a, myth, consists, of, juxtaposed, binary, oppositions, oedipus, for, example, consists, of, the, overrating, of, blood, relations, and, the, underrating, of, blood, relations, the, autochthonous, origin, of, humans, and, the, denial, of, their, autochthonous, origin, influenced, by, hegel, l, vi, strauss, believed, that, the, human, mind, thinks, fundamentally, in, these, binary, oppositions, and, their, unification, the, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, triad, and, that, these, are, what, makes, meaning, possible, furthermore, he, considered, the, job, of, myth, to, be, a, sleight, of, hand, an, association, of, an, irreconcilable, binary, opposition, with, a, reconcilable, binary, opposition, creating, the, illusion, or, belief, that, the, former, had, been, resolved, l, vi, strauss, sees, a, basic, paradox, in, the, study, of, myth, on, one, hand, mythical, stories, are, fantastic, and, unpredictable, the, content, of, myth, seems, completely, arbitrary, on, the, other, hand, the, myths, of, different, cultures, are, surprisingly, similar, 208, on, the, one, hand, it, would, seem, that, in, the, course, of, a, myth, anything, is, likely, to, happen, but, on, the, other, hand, this, apparent, arbitrariness, is, belied, by, the, astounding, similarity, between, myths, collected, in, widely, different, regions, therefore, the, problem, if, the, content, of, myth, is, contingent, how, are, we, to, explain, the, fact, that, myths, throughout, the, world, are, so, similar, l, vi, strauss, proposed, that, universal, laws, must, govern, mythical, thought, and, resolve, this, seeming, paradox, producing, similar, myths, in, different, cultures, each, myth, may, seem, unique, but, he, proposed, it, is, just, one, particular, instance, of, a, universal, law, of, human, thought, in, studying, myth, l, vi, strauss, tries, to, reduce, apparently, arbitrary, data, to, some, kind, of, order, and, to, attain, a, level, at, which, a, kind, of, necessity, becomes, apparent, underlying, the, illusions, of, liberty, laurie, suggests, that, for, levi, strauss, operations, embedded, within, animal, myths, provide, opportunities, to, resolve, collective, problems, of, classification, and, hierarchy, marking, lines, between, the, inside, and, the, outside, the, law, and, its, exceptions, those, who, belong, and, those, who, do, not, according, to, l, vi, strauss, mythical, thought, always, progresses, from, the, awareness, of, oppositions, toward, their, resolution, 224, in, other, words, myths, consist, of, for, example, l, vi, strauss, thinks, the, trickster, of, many, native, american, mythologies, acts, as, a, mediator, l, vi, strauss, s, argument, hinges, on, two, facts, about, the, native, american, trickster, l, vi, strauss, argues, that, the, raven, and, coyote, mediate, the, opposition, between, life, and, death, the, relationship, between, agriculture, and, hunting, is, analogous, to, the, opposition, between, life, and, death, agriculture, is, solely, concerned, with, producing, life, at, least, up, until, harvest, time, hunting, is, concerned, with, producing, death, furthermore, the, relationship, between, herbivores, and, beasts, of, prey, is, analogous, to, the, relationship, between, agriculture, and, hunting, like, agriculture, herbivores, are, concerned, with, plants, like, hunting, beasts, of, prey, are, concerned, with, catching, meat, l, vi, strauss, points, out, that, the, raven, and, coyote, eat, carrion, and, are, therefore, halfway, between, herbivores, and, beasts, of, prey, like, beasts, of, prey, they, eat, meat, like, herbivores, they, do, not, catch, their, food, thus, he, argues, we, have, a, mediating, structure, of, the, following, type, 224, by, uniting, herbivore, traits, with, traits, of, beasts, of, prey, the, raven, and, coyote, somewhat, reconcile, herbivores, and, beasts, of, prey, in, other, words, they, mediate, the, opposition, between, herbivores, and, beasts, of, prey, as, we, have, seen, this, opposition, ultimately, is, analogous, to, the, opposition, between, life, and, death, therefore, the, raven, and, coyote, ultimately, mediate, the, opposition, between, life, and, death, this, l, vi, strauss, believes, explains, why, the, coyote, and, raven, have, contradictory, personalities, when, they, appear, as, the, mythical, trickster, the, trickster, is, a, mediator, since, his, mediating, function, occupies, a, position, halfway, between, two, polar, terms, he, must, retain, something, of, that, duality, namely, an, ambiguous, and, equivocal, character, 226, because, the, raven, and, coyote, reconcile, profoundly, opposed, concepts, i, e, life, and, death, their, own, mythical, personalities, must, reflect, this, duality, or, contradiction, in, other, words, they, must, have, a, contradictory, tricky, personality, this, theory, about, the, structure, of, myth, helps, support, l, vi, strauss, s, more, basic, theory, about, human, thought, according, to, this, more, basic, theory, universal, laws, govern, all, areas, of, human, thought, if, it, were, possible, to, prove, in, this, instance, too, that, the, apparent, arbitrariness, of, the, mind, its, supposedly, spontaneous, flow, of, inspiration, and, its, seemingly, uncontrolled, inventiveness, laws, operating, at, a, deeper, level, if, the, human, mind, appears, determined, even, in, the, realm, of, mythology, a, fortiori, it, must, also, be, determined, in, all, its, spheres, of, activity, out, of, all, the, products, of, culture, myths, seem, the, most, fantastic, and, unpredictable, therefore, l, vi, strauss, claims, that, if, even, mythical, thought, obeys, universal, laws, then, all, human, thought, must, obey, universal, laws, l, vi, strauss, developed, the, comparison, of, the, bricoleur, and, engineer, in, the, savage, mind, bricoleur, has, its, origin, in, the, old, french, verb, bricoler, which, originally, referred, to, extraneous, movements, in, ball, games, billiards, hunting, shooting, and, riding, but, which, today, means, do, it, yourself, building, or, repairing, things, with, the, tools, and, materials, on, hand, puttering, or, tinkering, as, it, were, in, comparison, to, the, true, craftsman, whom, l, vi, strauss, calls, the, engineer, the, bricoleur, is, adept, at, many, tasks, and, at, putting, preexisting, things, together, in, new, ways, adapting, his, project, to, a, finite, stock, of, materials, and, tools, the, engineer, deals, with, projects, in, their, entirety, conceiving, and, procuring, all, the, necessary, materials, and, tools, to, suit, his, project, the, bricoleur, approximates, the, savage, mind, and, the, engineer, approximates, the, scientific, mind, l, vi, strauss, says, that, the, universe, of, the, bricoleur, is, closed, and, he, often, is, forced, to, make, do, with, whatever, is, at, hand, whereas, the, universe, of, the, engineer, is, open, in, that, he, is, able, to, create, new, tools, and, materials, however, both, live, within, a, restrictive, reality, and, so, the, engineer, is, forced, to, consider, the, preexisting, set, of, theoretical, and, practical, knowledge, of, technical, means, in, a, similar, way, to, the, bricoleur, l, vi, strauss, s, theory, on, the, origin, of, the, trickster, has, been, criticized, on, a, number, of, points, by, anthropologists, stanley, diamond, notes, that, while, the, secular, civilized, often, consider, the, concepts, of, life, and, death, to, be, polar, primitive, cultures, often, see, them, as, aspects, of, a, single, condition, the, condition, of, existence, 308, diamond, remarks, that, l, vi, strauss, did, not, reach, such, a, conclusion, by, inductive, reasoning, but, simply, by, working, backwards, from, the, evidence, to, the, a, priori, mediated, concepts, 310, of, life, and, death, which, he, reached, by, assumption, of, a, necessary, progression, from, life, to, agriculture, to, herbivorous, animals, and, from, death, to, warfare, to, beasts, of, prey, for, that, matter, the, coyote, is, well, known, to, hunt, in, addition, to, scavenging, and, the, raven, also, has, been, known, to, act, as, a, bird, of, prey, in, contrast, to, l, vi, strauss, s, conception, nor, does, that, conception, explain, why, a, scavenger, such, as, a, bear, would, never, appear, as, the, trickster, diamond, further, remarks, that, the, trickster, names, raven, and, coyote, which, l, vi, strauss, explains, can, be, arrived, at, with, greater, economy, on, the, basis, of, let, us, say, the, cleverness, of, the, animals, involved, their, ubiquity, elusiveness, capacity, to, make, mischief, their, undomesticated, reflection, of, certain, human, traits, 311, finally, l, vi, strauss, s, analysis, does, not, appear, to, be, capable, of, explaining, why, representations, of, the, trickster, in, other, areas, of, the, world, make, use, of, such, animals, as, the, spider, and, mantis, edmund, leach, wrote, that, the, outstanding, characteristic, of, his, writing, whether, in, french, or, english, is, that, it, is, difficult, to, understand, his, sociological, theories, combine, baffling, complexity, with, overwhelming, erudition, some, readers, even, suspect, that, they, are, being, treated, to, a, confidence, trick, sociologist, stanislav, andreski, criticized, l, vi, strauss, s, work, generally, arguing, that, his, scholarship, was, often, sloppy, and, moreover, that, much, of, his, mystique, and, reputation, stemmed, from, his, threatening, people, with, mathematics, a, reference, to, l, vi, strauss, s, use, of, quasi, algebraic, equations, to, explain, his, ideas, drawing, on, postcolonial, approaches, to, anthropology, timothy, laurie, has, suggested, that, l, vi, strauss, speaks, from, the, vantage, point, of, a, state, intent, on, securing, knowledge, for, the, purposes, of, as, he, himself, would, often, claim, salvaging, local, cultures, but, the, salvation, workers, also, ascribe, to, themselves, legitimacy, and, authority, in, the, process, he, married, dina, dreyfus, in, 1932, they, later, divorced, he, was, then, married, to, rose, marie, ullmo, from, 1946, to, 1954, they, had, one, son, laurent, his, third, and, last, wife, was, monique, roman, they,
