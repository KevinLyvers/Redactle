teens, and, early, twenties, writing, that, he, became, addicted, to, nonconsensual, frotteurism, at, the, age, of, fifteen, and, claimed, to, have, had, had, hundreds, of, frotteur, incited, sex, adventures, until, his, twenties, he, reported, that, he, sought, out, crowded, trains, standing, rooms, in, the, back, of, movie, theaters, crowded, elevators, and, other, places, where, i, could, rub, my, midsection, against, women, s, backsides, and, hips, and, soon, get, delicious, orgasm, stating, that, the, encounters, were, sometimes, nonconsenting, ellis, also, wrote, i, am, now, when, i, think, about, it, guilty, about, my, acts, i, have, remorse, for, what, i, did, adding, that, i, deplore, the, sin, and, accept, the, sinner, but, then, went, on, to, say, i, knew, that, frotteurism, was, wrong, that, it, is, sometimes, nonconsenting, but, subway, sex, was, the, cheapest, and, easiest, sex, i, ever, had, and, i, continued, it, into, my, twenties, but, in, some, ways, it, was, great, no, fuss, no, obligations, no, time, wasted, no, having, to, put, up, with, the, inane, conversation, of, most, women, no, pregnancy, no, disease, no, boredom, illness, was, to, follow, ellis, throughout, his, life, at, age, 40, he, developed, diabetes, ellis, had, exaggerated, fears, of, speaking, in, public, and, during, his, adolescence, he, was, extremely, shy, around, women, at, age, 19, already, showing, signs, of, thinking, like, a, cognitive, behavioral, therapist, he, forced, himself, to, talk, to, 100, women, in, the, bronx, botanical, gardens, over, a, period, of, a, month, even, though, he, did, not, get, a, date, he, reported, that, he, desensitized, himself, to, his, fear, of, rejection, by, women, ellis, entered, the, field, of, clinical, psychology, after, first, earning, a, bachelor, of, arts, degree, in, business, from, what, was, then, known, as, the, city, college, of, new, york, downtown, in, 1934, he, began, a, brief, career, in, business, followed, by, one, as, a, writer, these, endeavors, took, place, during, the, great, depression, that, began, in, 1929, and, ellis, found, that, business, was, poor, and, had, no, success, in, publishing, his, fiction, finding, that, he, could, write, non, fiction, well, ellis, researched, and, wrote, on, human, sexuality, his, lay, counseling, in, this, subject, convinced, him, to, seek, a, new, career, in, clinical, psychology, in, 1942, ellis, began, his, studies, for, a, phd, in, clinical, psychology, at, teachers, college, columbia, university, which, trained, psychologists, mostly, in, psychoanalysis, he, completed, his, master, of, arts, in, clinical, psychology, from, teachers, college, in, june, 1943, and, started, a, part, time, private, practice, while, still, working, on, his, phd, degree, possibly, because, there, was, no, licensing, of, psychologists, in, new, york, at, that, time, ellis, began, publishing, articles, even, before, receiving, his, phd, in, 1946, he, wrote, a, critique, of, many, widely, used, pencil, and, paper, personality, tests, he, concluded, that, only, the, minnesota, multiphasic, personality, inventory, met, the, standards, of, a, research, based, instrument, in, 1947, he, was, awarded, a, phd, in, clinical, psychology, at, columbia, and, at, that, time, ellis, had, come, to, believe, that, psychoanalysis, was, the, deepest, and, most, effective, form, of, therapy, like, most, psychologists, of, that, time, he, was, interested, in, the, theories, of, sigmund, freud, he, sought, additional, training, in, psychoanalysis, and, then, began, to, practice, classical, psychoanalysis, shortly, after, receiving, his, phd, in, 1947, ellis, began, a, jungian, analysis, and, program, of, supervision, with, richard, hulbeck, a, leading, analyst, at, the, karen, horney, institute, whose, own, analyst, had, been, hermann, rorschach, the, developer, of, the, rorschach, inkblot, test, at, that, time, he, taught, at, new, york, university, rutgers, university, and, pittsburg, state, university, and, held, a, couple, of, leading, staff, positions, at, this, time, ellis, faith, in, psychoanalysis, was, gradually, crumbling, the, writings, of, karen, horney, alfred, adler, erich, fromm, and, harry, stack, sullivan, would, be, some, of, the, influences, in, ellis, s, thinking, and, played, a, role, in, shaping, his, psychological, models, ellis, credits, alfred, korzybski, his, book, science, and, sanity, and, general, semantics, for, starting, him, on, the, philosophical, path, for, founding, rational, therapy, in, addition, modern, and, ancient, philosophy, particularly, stoicism, and, his, own, experiences, heavily, influenced, his, new, theoretical, developments, to, psychotherapy, ellis, acknowledged, that, his, therapy, was, by, no, means, entirely, new, as, in, particular, paul, charles, dubois, s, rational, persuasion, had, prefigured, some, of, its, main, principles, ellis, stated, he, had, read, him, some, years, after, inventing, his, therapy, but, had, studied, mile, cou, since, a, young, age, from, the, late, 1940s, onward, ellis, worked, on, rational, emotive, behavioral, therapy, rebt, and, by, january, 1953, his, break, with, psychoanalysis, was, complete, and, he, began, calling, himself, a, rational, therapist, ellis, was, now, advocating, a, new, more, active, and, directive, type, of, psychotherapy, in, 1955, he, presented, rational, therapy, rt, in, rt, the, therapist, sought, to, help, the, client, understand, and, act, on, the, understanding, that, his, personal, philosophy, contained, beliefs, that, contributed, to, his, own, emotional, pain, this, new, approach, stressed, actively, working, to, change, a, client, s, self, defeating, beliefs, and, behaviours, by, demonstrating, their, irrationality, self, defeatism, and, rigidity, ellis, believed, that, through, rational, analysis, and, cognitive, reconstruction, people, could, understand, their, self, defeatingness, in, light, of, their, core, irrational, beliefs, and, then, develop, more, rational, constructs, in, 1954, ellis, began, teaching, his, new, techniques, to, other, therapists, and, by, 1957, he, formally, set, forth, the, first, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, by, proposing, that, therapists, help, people, adjust, their, thinking, and, behavior, as, the, treatment, for, emotional, and, behavioral, problems, two, years, later, ellis, published, how, to, live, with, a, neurotic, which, elaborated, on, his, new, method, in, 1960, ellis, presented, a, paper, on, his, new, approach, at, the, american, psychological, association, apa, convention, in, chicago, there, was, mild, interest, but, few, recognized, that, the, paradigm, set, forth, would, become, the, zeitgeist, within, a, generation, at, that, time, the, prevailing, interest, in, experimental, psychology, was, behaviorism, while, in, clinical, psychology, it, was, the, psychoanalytic, schools, of, notables, such, as, freud, jung, adler, and, perls, despite, the, fact, that, ellis, approach, emphasized, cognitive, emotive, and, behavioral, methods, his, strong, cognitive, emphasis, provoked, the, psychotherapeutic, establishment, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, followers, of, adler, consequently, he, was, often, received, with, significant, hostility, at, professional, conferences, and, in, print, he, regularly, held, seminars, where, he, would, bring, a, participant, up, on, stage, and, treat, them, his, own, therapeutical, style, was, famed, for, often, being, delivered, in, a, rough, confrontational, style, however, it, should, not, be, confused, with, his, rational, emotive, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, school, that, is, practiced, by, his, students, and, followers, in, a, large, variety, of, therapeutic, styles, e, g, often, depending, on, client, s, personality, client, s, clinical, problem, and, evidence, based, information, regarding, the, appropriate, intervention, but, also, including, therapist, s, own, preference, despite, the, relative, slow, adoption, of, his, approach, in, the, beginning, ellis, founded, his, own, institute, the, institute, for, rational, living, was, founded, as, a, non, profit, organization, in, 1959, by, 1968, it, was, chartered, by, the, new, york, state, board, of, regents, as, a, training, institute, and, psychological, clinic, by, the, 1960s, ellis, had, come, to, be, seen, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, american, sexual, revolution, especially, in, his, earlier, career, he, was, well, known, for, his, work, as, a, sexologist, and, for, his, liberal, humanistic, and, in, some, camps, controversial, opinions, on, human, sexuality, he, also, worked, with, noted, zoologist, and, sex, researcher, alfred, kinsey, and, explored, in, a, number, of, books, and, articles, the, topic, of, human, sexuality, and, love, sex, and, love, relations, were, his, professional, interests, even, from, the, beginning, of, his, career, norman, haire, in, his, preface, to, ellis, 1952, book, sex, beliefs, and, customs, applauded, the, work, of, the, society, for, the, prevention, of, venereal, disease, while, he, ridiculed, its, rival, the, national, council, for, combating, venereal, disease, who, argued, that, preventive, measures, such, as, condoms, would, encourage, vice, haire, called, them, the, society, for, the, prevention, of, the, prevention, of, venereal, disease, in, 1958, ellis, published, his, classic, work, sex, without, guilt, which, came, to, be, known, for, its, advocacy, of, a, liberal, attitude, toward, sex, he, contributed, to, paul, krassner, s, magazine, the, realist, among, its, articles, in, 1964, he, wrote, if, this, be, heresy, is, pornography, harmful, to, children, in, 1965, ellis, published, a, book, entitled, homosexuality, its, causes, and, cure, which, partly, saw, homosexuality, as, a, pathology, and, therefore, a, condition, to, be, cured, in, 1973, the, american, psychiatric, association, reversed, its, position, on, homosexuality, by, declaring, that, it, was, not, a, mental, disorder, and, thus, not, properly, subject, to, cure, and, in, 1976, ellis, clarified, his, earlier, views, in, sex, and, the, liberated, man, expounding, that, some, homosexual, disturbed, behaviors, may, be, subject, to, treatment, but, in, most, cases, that, should, not, be, attempted, as, homosexuality, is, not, inherently, good, or, evil, except, from, a, religious, viewpoint, see, ellis, and, religion, below, near, the, end, of, his, life, he, finally, updated, and, re, wrote, sex, without, guilt, in, 2001, and, released, as, sex, without, guilt, in, the, twenty, first, century, in, this, book, he, expounded, and, enhanced, his, humanistic, view, on, sexual, ethics, and, morality, and, dedicated, a, chapter, on, homosexuality, to, giving, homosexuals, advice, and, suggestion, on, how, to, more, greatly, enjoy, and, enhance, their, sexual, love, lives, while, preserving, some, of, the, ideas, about, human, sexuality, from, the, original, the, revision, described, his, later, humanistic, opinions, and, ethical, ideals, as, they, had, evolved, in, his, academic, work, and, practice, ellis, is, primarily, known, for, his, development, of, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, rebt, he, published, his, first, major, book, on, it, in, 1962, rebt, is, an, active, directive, philosophically, and, empirically, based, psychotherapy, the, aim, of, which, is, to, resolve, emotional, and, behavioral, problems, and, disturbances, and, to, help, people, to, lead, happier, and, more, fulfilling, lives, rebt, sees, disturbances, as, caused, by, characteristics, of, a, person, rather, than, a, particular, past, event, rebt, is, seen, as, the, first, form, of, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, later, in, life, ellis, wrote, i, hope, i, am, also, not, a, devout, rebter, since, i, do, not, think, it, is, an, unmitigated, cure, for, everyone, and, do, accept, its, distinct, limitations, ellis, advocated, the, importance, of, accepting, yourself, just, because, you, are, alive, human, and, unique, and, not, giving, yourself, a, global, rating, or, being, influenced, by, what, others, think, of, you, in, 1979, and, during, the, next, two, decades, one, part, of, ellis, research, was, an, exploration, of, behavioral, integrity, through, applied, experimental, psychology, focusing, on, reliability, honesty, and, loyalty, as, psychosocial, behavior, organizational, commitment, as, a, cognitive, norm, evaluating, concretely, through, images, developed, in, his, institute, in, his, book, personality, theories, developed, with, mike, abrams, and, lidia, dengelegi, abrams, establish, the, opinions, of, evaluation, of, integrity, understanding, the, reason, of, each, personality, can, have, a, change, in, their, attitude, reliability, is, the, common, factor, of, their, samples, taken, and, of, the, which, great, advances, were, obtained, to, look, for, a, tool, to, work, with, the, human, mind, in, his, original, version, of, his, book, sex, without, guilt, ellis, expressed, the, opinion, that, religious, restrictions, on, sexual, expression, are, often, needless, and, harmful, to, emotional, health, he, also, famously, debated, religious, psychologists, including, orval, hobart, mowrer, and, allen, bergin, over, the, proposition, that, religion, often, contributed, to, psychological, distress, because, of, his, forthright, espousal, of, a, nontheistic, humanism, he, was, recognized, in, 1971, as, humanist, of, the, year, by, the, american, humanist, association, by, 2003, he, was, one, of, the, signers, of, the, humanist, manifesto, ellis, most, recently, described, himself, as, a, probabilistic, atheist, meaning, that, while, he, acknowledged, that, he, could, not, be, completely, certain, there, is, no, god, he, believed, the, probability, a, god, exists, was, so, small, that, it, was, not, worth, his, or, anyone, else, s, attention, while, ellis, personal, atheism, and, humanism, remained, consistent, his, views, about, the, role, of, religion, in, mental, health, changed, over, time, in, early, comments, delivered, at, conventions, and, at, his, institute, in, new, york, city, ellis, overtly, and, often, with, characteristically, acerbic, delivery, stated, that, devout, religious, beliefs, and, practices, were, harmful, to, mental, health, in, the, case, against, religiosity, a, 1980, pamphlet, published, by, his, new, york, institute, he, offered, an, idiosyncratic, definition, of, religiosity, as, any, devout, dogmatic, and, demanding, belief, he, noted, that, religious, codes, and, religious, individuals, often, manifest, religiosity, but, added, that, devout, demanding, religiosity, is, also, obvious, among, many, orthodox, psychotherapists, and, psychoanalysts, devout, political, believers, and, aggressive, atheists, ellis, was, careful, to, state, that, rebt, was, independent, of, his, atheism, noting, that, many, skilled, rebt, practitioners, are, religious, including, some, who, are, ordained, ministers, in, his, later, days, he, significantly, toned, down, his, opposition, to, religion, while, ellis, maintained, his, firm, atheistic, stance, proposing, that, thoughtful, probabilistic, atheism, was, likely, the, most, emotionally, healthy, approach, to, life, he, acknowledged, and, agreed, with, survey, evidence, suggesting, that, belief, in, a, loving, god, can, also, be, psychologically, healthy, based, on, this, later, approach, to, religion, he, reformulated, his, professional, and, personal, view, in, one, of, his, last, books, the, road, to, tolerance, and, he, also, co, authored, a, book, counseling, and, psychotherapy, with, religious, persons, a, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, approach, with, two, religious, psychologists, stevan, lars, nielsen, and, w, brad, johnson, describing, principles, for, integrating, religious, material, and, beliefs, with, rebt, during, treatment, of, religious, clients, ellis, was, a, lifelong, advocate, for, peace, and, an, opponent, of, militarism, he, also, praised, libertarian, economist, walter, block, s, book, defending, the, undefendable, while, many, of, his, ideas, were, criticized, during, the, 1950s, and, 60s, by, the, psychotherapeutic, establishment, his, reputation, grew, immensely, in, the, subsequent, decades, from, the, 1960s, on, his, prominence, was, steadily, growing, as, the, cognitive, behavioral, therapies, cbt, were, gaining, further, theoretical, and, scientific, ground, from, then, cbt, gradually, became, one, of, the, most, popular, systems, of, psychotherapy, in, many, countries, mainly, due, to, the, large, body, of, rigorously, conducted, research, that, underpinned, the, work, of, the, cognitive, therapy, school, a, key, part, of, the, cbt, family, founded, by, aaron, t, beck, in, the, late, 1960s, his, institute, launched, a, professional, journal, and, in, the, early, 70s, established, the, living, school, for, children, between, 6, and, 13, the, school, provided, a, curriculum, that, incorporated, the, principles, of, re, b, t, despite, its, relative, short, life, interest, groups, generally, expressed, satisfaction, with, its, programmer, many, schools, of, psychological, thought, became, influenced, by, albert, ellis, including, rational, behavior, therapy, created, by, a, student, of, his, maxie, clarence, maultsby, jr, ellis, had, such, an, impact, that, in, a, 1982, survey, american, and, canadian, clinical, psychologists, and, counsellors, ranked, him, ahead, of, freud, when, asked, to, name, the, figure, who, had, exerted, the, average, influence, on, their, field, also, in, 1982, in, an, analysis, of, psychology, journals, published, in, the, us, it, was, found, that, ellis, was, the, most, cited, author, after, 1957, in, 1985, the, apa, presented, ellis, with, its, award, for, distinguished, professional, contributions, he, held, many, important, positions, in, many, professional, societies, including, the, division, of, consulting, psychology, of, the, apa, society, for, the, scientific, study, of, sexuality, american, association, of, marital, and, family, therapy, the, american, academy, of, psychotherapists, and, the, american, association, of, sex, educators, counsellors, and, therapists, in, addition, ellis, also, served, as, consulting, or, associate, editor, of, many, scientific, journals, many, professional, societies, gave, ellis, their, highest, professional, and, clinical, awards, in, the, mid, 1990s, he, renamed, his, psychotherapy, and, behavior, change, system, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, rebt, it, was, originally, known, as, rational, therapy, and, then, rational, emotive, therapy, this, he, did, to, stress, the, interrelated, importance, of, cognition, emotion, and, behavior, in, his, therapeutic, approach, in, 1994, he, also, updated, and, revised, his, original, 1962, classic, book, reason, and, emotion, in, psychotherapy, during, the, remainder, of, his, life, he, continued, developing, the, theory, that, cognition, emotion, and, behavior, are, intertwined, and, that, a, system, for, psychotherapy, and, behavior, change, must, involve, all, three, ellis, s, work, extended, into, areas, other, than, psychology, including, education, politics, business, and, philosophy, he, eventually, became, a, prominent, and, confrontational, social, commenter, and, public, speaker, on, a, wide, array, of, issues, during, his, career, he, publicly, debated, a, vast, number, of, people, who, represented, opposing, views, to, his, this, included, for, example, debates, with, psychologist, nathaniel, branden, on, objectivism, and, psychiatrist, thomas, szasz, on, the, topic, of, mental, illness, on, numerous, occasions, he, critiqued, opposing, psychotherapeutic, approaches, and, questioned, some, of, the, doctrines, in, certain, dogmatic, religious, systems, i, e,
