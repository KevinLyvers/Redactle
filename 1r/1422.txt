communist, party, of, czechoslovakia, 1948, 1970, public, against, violence, 1989, 1992, alexander, dub, ek, slovak, pronunciation, 27, november, 1921, 7, november, 1992, was, a, slovak, statesman, who, served, as, the, first, secretary, of, the, presidium, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, czechoslovakia, ks, de, facto, leader, of, czechoslovakia, from, january, 1968, to, april, 1969, and, as, chairman, of, the, federal, assembly, from, 1989, to, 1992, following, the, velvet, revolution, he, oversaw, significant, reforms, to, the, communist, system, during, a, period, that, became, known, as, the, prague, spring, but, his, reforms, were, reversed, and, he, was, eventually, sidelined, following, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, in, august, 1968, best, known, by, the, slogan, socialism, with, a, human, face, dub, ek, led, a, process, that, accelerated, cultural, and, economic, liberalization, in, czechoslovakia, reforms, were, opposed, by, conservatives, inside, the, party, who, benefited, from, the, stalinist, economy, as, well, as, interests, in, the, neighboring, soviet, bloc, who, feared, contagion, western, subversion, strategic, vulnerability, and, loss, of, institutional, power, for, reasons, of, institutional, interests, in, the, soviet, union, such, as, those, of, the, military, and, kgb, false, reports, and, the, growing, concern, among, the, soviet, leadership, that, dub, ek, was, no, longer, able, to, maintain, control, of, the, country, czechoslovakia, was, invaded, by, half, a, million, soviet, led, warsaw, pact, troops, on, the, night, of, 20, 21, august, 1968, this, was, intended, to, enable, a, coup, by, conservative, forces, that, coup, however, could, not, materialize, due, to, lack, of, a, viable, pro, soviet, replacement, leadership, and, the, unexpected, extraordinary, popularity, of, dub, ek, and, the, reformist, leadership, soviet, intervention, ushered, in, a, period, of, maneuver, between, conservatives, and, reformers, where, conservatives, relied, on, soviet, influence, to, shift, the, balance, of, power, reversing, reforms, of, the, prague, spring, dub, ek, was, forced, to, resign, as, party, head, in, april, 1969, succeeded, by, gust, v, hus, k, a, former, reformer, and, victim, of, stalinism, who, was, ambiguously, favored, by, moscow, this, signaled, the, end, of, the, prague, spring, and, the, beginning, of, normalization, dub, ek, was, expelled, from, the, communist, party, in, 1970, amid, a, purge, that, eventually, expelled, almost, two, thirds, of, the, 1968, party, membership, this, mostly, purged, the, younger, generation, of, post, stalin, communists, that, he, represented, along, with, many, of, the, most, competent, technical, experts, and, managers, during, the, velvet, revolution, in, 1989, dub, ek, served, as, the, chairman, of, the, federal, czechoslovak, parliament, and, contended, for, the, presidency, with, v, clav, havel, the, european, parliament, awarded, dub, ek, the, sakharov, prize, the, same, year, in, the, interim, between, the, prague, spring, and, the, velvet, revolution, dub, ek, withdrew, from, high, politics, but, served, as, a, leading, inspiration, and, symbolic, leader, for, eurocommunism, maintaining, intermittent, contact, with, european, communist, reformers, especially, in, italy, and, the, soviet, union, also, in, 1989, just, before, his, death, andrei, sakharov, wrote, i, am, convinced, that, the, breath, of, freedom, which, the, czechs, and, the, slovaks, enjoyed, when, dub, ek, was, their, leader, was, a, prologue, to, the, peaceful, revolutions, now, taking, place, in, eastern, europe, and, czechoslovakia, itself, sakharov, credited, dub, ek, and, the, prague, spring, as, his, inspiration, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, an, automobile, crash, in, 1992, dub, ek, remained, an, important, political, figure, many, saw, him, as, the, destined, future, president, of, newly, formed, slovakia, since, that, time, his, life, and, work, have, been, significantly, re, evaluated, this, comes, after, long, being, over, shadowed, by, simplistic, cold, war, narratives, and, rhetoric, according, to, jan, adamec, a, historical, scholar, based, in, prague, i, think, there, is, a, trend, that, became, apparent, around, 2009, and, became, even, more, visible, after, v, clav, havel, s, death, which, shows, certain, reconsideration, of, the, period, between, 1968, and, 1989, the, picture, is, becoming, more, diverse, and, is, no, longer, as, black, and, white, as, it, was, in, the, 1990s, the, communist, evil, and, the, fearful, suppressed, society, the, picture, is, now, gaining, a, variety, of, colours, since, 1989, many, historians, and, scholars, have, paraphrased, gennadi, gerasimov, a, spokesman, for, mikhail, gorbachev, when, asked, the, difference, between, what, gorbachev, and, dub, ek, had, done, he, said, it, was, 19, years, many, have, questioned, this, since, that, time, better, seeing, nuance, and, particularities, beyond, cold, war, narratives, in, fact, despite, both, future, leaders, profoundly, questioning, stalinism, at, the, time, of, nikita, khrushchev, secret, speech, in, 1956, dub, ek, had, a, family, upbringing, and, early, education, very, different, from, the, conventional, communist, party, training, that, many, assume, him, to, have, as, well, as, fundamentally, different, education, than, both, gorbachev, and, velvet, revolution, leader, v, clav, havel, as, ivan, laluha, points, out, his, thinking, was, shaped, by, his, upbringing, by, unconventional, parents, and, personal, experience, of, and, longtime, associations, with, utopian, and, international, experiments, and, members, that, emphasized, a, consensus, style, of, leadership, alexander, dub, ek, was, born, in, uhrovec, slovakia, then, part, of, czechoslovakia, on, 27, november, 1921, when, he, was, three, years, old, the, family, moved, to, the, soviet, union, he, spent, most, of, his, childhood, living, on, what, some, have, called, a, commune, in, kyrgyzstan, the, settlement, was, in, pishpek, now, bishkek, in, the, kirghiz, ssr, of, the, soviet, union, now, the, independent, state, of, kyrgyzstan, it, was, a, utopian, esperantist, and, idist, industrial, cooperative, interhelpo, pavol, dub, ek, alexander, s, son, described, what, his, grandfather, s, family, found, as, there, was, nothing, there, but, an, old, barracks, after, the, family, had, come, promised, job, opportunities, and, a, good, life, he, said, many, of, the, first, generation, of, immigrant, children, suffered, typhus, despite, this, pavol, said, it, was, impossible, to, go, back, at, that, time, in, 1933, the, family, moved, to, the, central, russian, city, of, gorky, now, nizhny, novgorod, alexander, was, then, 12, in, 1938, due, to, general, orders, by, stalin, they, would, have, had, to, renounce, their, czechoslovak, citizenship, in, order, to, stay, with, the, same, loyalty, to, their, place, of, birth, that, alexander, would, show, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, family, returned, to, czechoslovakia, at, 17, years, old, alexander, joined, the, then, illegal, communist, party, of, slovakia, kss, working, to, organize, resistance, at, his, workplace, it, was, here, as, a, factory, worker, in, dubnica, nad, v, hom, where, he, learned, his, first, trade, he, worked, together, with, his, brother, j, lius, and, with, his, childhood, friend, anna, borsekova, they, fought, against, the, wartime, pro, german, slovak, state, headed, by, jozef, tiso, in, august, 1944, dub, ek, and, his, brother, were, ordered, to, join, the, partisans, they, were, members, of, the, jan, i, ka, partisan, brigade, during, the, slovak, national, uprising, his, brother, died, in, the, uprising, the, second, and, last, time, alexander, was, wounded, he, was, sent, to, the, peterov, family, in, vel, ice, to, recover, with, anna, s, help, because, of, his, participation, in, the, uprising, this, would, be, a, bad, mark, against, him, during, the, stalinist, period, after, authorities, began, amalgamating, the, activities, of, partisans, in, the, uprisings, with, members, of, the, wartime, regime, and, other, non, communist, elements, dub, ek, s, father, tefan, had, been, a, member, of, the, party, since, 1921, upon, his, return, he, became, active, in, it, once, again, tefan, was, responsible, for, printing, the, party, papers, forged, and, official, documents, as, well, as, producing, other, left, wing, publications, during, this, time, the, activities, of, alexander, and, his, family, relied, more, on, working, through, personal, networks, rather, than, party, cells, the, entire, family, was, involved, shifting, from, one, place, to, the, next, eventually, moving, to, vel, ice, after, the, arrest, of, much, of, the, kss, leadership, in, 1942, tefan, and, the, dub, eks, worked, with, another, former, interhelpo, member, primarily, organizing, communist, youth, alexander, was, arrested, himself, in, july, but, not, before, having, significant, impact, and, authority, after, tefan, was, arrested, tefan, was, sent, to, prison, and, eventually, to, mauthausen, concentration, camp, which, he, survived, in, part, because, he, was, there, a, short, time, dub, ek, married, childhood, friend, anna, dub, ekov, n, e, borsekov, in, september, 1945, they, started, a, home, in, tren, n, dub, ek, began, his, studies, at, comenius, university, in, bratislava, but, he, would, return, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1955, to, attend, the, university, of, politics, in, moscow, where, he, graduated, in, 1958, before, he, returned, home, while, in, moscow, dub, ek, s, russian, friends, learned, of, khrushchev, s, secret, speech, denouncing, stalin, in, 1956, it, would, be, a, couple, of, months, before, they, would, tell, him, about, it, the, speech, had, been, an, answer, to, stories, circulating, of, those, who, had, begun, returning, from, false, imprisonment, in, the, gulag, as, much, as, dub, ek, was, disturbed, by, the, news, of, what, stalin, had, done, he, also, admired, khrushchev, for, making, the, speech, over, the, opposition, of, most, of, the, leadership, who, were, themselves, involved, in, 1948, the, party, he, had, joined, was, reorganized, as, the, slovak, branch, of, the, communist, party, of, czechoslovakia, ks, though, still, outside, of, the, higher, circles, dub, ek, s, generation, represented, the, young, idealistic, rank, and, file, of, the, party, that, took, power, in, 1948, not, a, break, from, it, it, was, stalinism, that, represented, the, discontinuity, it, was, this, pre, stalinist, generation, that, originally, seized, power, allied, with, the, younger, generation, of, party, members, who, began, to, question, the, path, taken, by, their, leadership, elders, as, they, began, to, rise, in, the, ranks, during, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, slovak, branch, of, the, party, emerged, from, the, war, with, a, smaller, membership, base, and, less, connection, with, slovak, institutions, than, the, czech, branches, had, to, recruit, a, mass, party, base, for, electoral, politics, the, party, s, leadership, which, was, over, 60, years, old, on, average, appealed, to, a, broad, segment, of, less, ideologically, motivated, younger, people, giving, the, party, a, more, pragmatic, and, less, orthodox, culture, in, contrast, to, the, czech, branch, of, the, party, family, regional, identity, religious, professional, and, inter, personal, relationships, formed, the, glue, of, the, slovak, branch, of, the, party, a, socially, idealistic, dub, ek, with, no, rigid, ideological, destination, in, mind, rose, amid, these, ranks, in, 1948, the, communist, party, of, czechoslovakia, took, power, in, june, 1949, still, in, tren, n, dub, ek, was, promoted, from, his, minor, party, duties, at, his, workplace, to, administrative, secretary, of, the, ov, kss, he, rose, through, the, party, ranks, as, a, party, functionary, first, in, tren, n, then, being, transferred, to, bratislava, and, then, to, bansk, bystrica, while, he, pursued, further, education, and, training, he, left, for, the, soviet, union, in, 1955, but, returned, in, 1958, after, completing, his, university, education, there, shortly, after, returning, from, moscow, in, september, 1958, he, was, appointed, head, secretary, of, the, west, slovak, regional, committee, of, the, kss, and, then, transferred, to, prague, in, 1960, there, as, secretary, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, the, czech, republic, for, industry, dub, ek, became, intensely, involved, in, the, work, of, rehabilitation, commissions, especially, drahomir, kolder, s, and, barnabit, s, 1962, 1963, learning, of, the, mechanisms, of, repression, dub, ek, would, call, this, a, watershed, in, his, thinking, that, would, dedicate, him, to, reforms, from, 1960, to, 1968, he, also, participated, in, the, national, assembly, in, 1963, a, power, struggle, in, the, leadership, of, the, slovak, branch, unseated, karol, bac, lek, and, pavol, david, hard, line, allies, of, anton, n, novotn, first, secretary, of, the, ks, and, president, of, czechoslovakia, bac, lek, was, removed, in, response, to, the, findings, of, the, rehabilitation, commissions, due, to, his, role, in, crimes, as, interior, minister, in, the, 1950s, in, their, place, a, new, generation, of, slovak, communists, took, control, of, party, and, state, organs, in, slovakia, led, by, dub, ek, who, became, first, secretary, of, the, slovak, branch, of, the, party, along, with, that, title, dub, ek, became, a, member, of, the, presidium, of, the, central, committee, of, the, ks, shortly, after, dub, ek, took, his, new, position, as, head, of, the, slovak, party, in, 1963, he, personally, oversaw, complete, rehabilitation, of, those, earlier, convicted, of, being, slovak, bourgeois, nationalists, he, promoted, the, return, of, historic, cultural, personalities, to, popular, awareness, within, slovak, society, this, took, the, form, of, celebrations, and, commemorations, such, as, the, 150th, birthdays, of, 19th, century, leaders, of, the, slovak, national, revival, udov, t, t, r, and, jozef, miloslav, hurban, the, centenary, of, the, matica, slovensk, in, 1963, and, the, twentieth, anniversary, of, the, slovak, national, uprising, dub, ek, himself, had, taken, part, in, even, before, this, reformist, take, over, the, political, and, intellectual, climate, in, slovakia, had, been, freer, than, that, in, the, czech, lands, meanwhile, cultural, weeklies, such, as, literarni, novinv, kult, rny, ivot, and, kulturni, tvorba, saw, greatly, expanded, readership, like, many, of, the, slovak, culture, institutions, these, publications, were, however, engaged, in, a, mostly, indirect, confrontation, with, the, center, such, as, obvious, ironic, overstating, of, the, party, line, political, conflicts, were, commonly, negotiated, this, was, complicated, by, exceptions, such, as, kult, rny, ivot, the, weekly, newspaper, of, the, union, of, slovak, writers, which, authorities, considered, politically, unreliable, such, direct, confrontations, were, spreading, in, 1967, vaclav, havel, s, play, the, memorandum, milan, kundera, s, novel, the, joke, novel, were, seen, by, many, writers, as, the, beginnings, of, open, rebellion, the, czechoslovak, economy, began, to, plateau, in, the, early, 1960s, the, one, size, fits, all, model, of, economic, planning, better, suited, to, the, pre, industrialized, soviet, union, of, the, 1930s, resulted, in, over, investment, in, heavy, industry, at, the, expense, of, light, industry, and, consumer, goods, quantity, was, maximized, regardless, of, costs, leading, to, poor, quality, and, prices, that, were, twice, that, of, world, prices, along, with, other, economists, ota, ik, condemned, the, existing, system, of, management, as, one, that, made, further, development, impossible, though, production, continued, to, grow, albeit, slowly, in, 1964, income, began, to, fall, this, forced, then, president, anton, n, novotn, to, begin, making, limited, concessions, to, liberalize, the, strictly, planned, economy, this, included, allowing, greater, freedom, to, companies, in, setting, prices, and, wages, though, the, source, of, the, immediate, crisis, was, the, now, pressing, economic, effects, dub, ek, s, generation, had, spent, the, early, 1960s, engaged, in, travel, research, and, study, heavily, supported, by, academia, the, state, and, the, party, their, body, of, research, and, experience, convinced, the, reformers, that, their, self, isolated, country, had, not, simply, reached, a, growth, impasse, but, had, fallen, behind, the, rest, of, the, world, due, to, a, generation, of, stagnation, in, all, spheres, of, life, reforms, only, touched, some, sectors, and, reforms, were, slow, which, the, regime, tried, to, make, up, with, increased, imports, liberalizing, the, centralized, economy, threatened, those, in, the, party, bureaucracy, who, administered, the, old, system, resulting, in, their, sabotage, and, slowing, of, what, reforms, were, voted, the, cultural, sphere, liberalized, the, most, completely, and, rapidly, but, the, economy, and, national, autonomy, remained, heavily, centralized, cultural, intellectuals, were, able, to, achieve, more, and, gain, greater, leverage, among, the, reformists, because, of, a, combination, of, a, greater, ability, to, connect, with, the, public, and, a, peculiarity, of, the, system, writers, and, publishers, benefited, from, the, autonomous, profitability, of, the, sectors, they, controlled, giving, them, fundamentally, different, interests, than, those, tied, to, heavy, industry, or, other, sectors, who, lacked, financial, independence, the, technocratic, economic, reformers, such, as, radoslav, seluck, who, denounced, the, cult, of, the, plan, were, only, slightly, less, ideologically, threatening, in, many, ways, they, were, just, as, dangerous, to, the, interests, of, conservatives, in, the, party, but, they, lacked, the, political, leverage, of, the, moral, economists, who, bridged, the, gap, with, the, writers, and, intellectuals, ota, ik, relied, on, an, interdisciplinary, approach, and, method, writers, and, cultural, intellectuals, began, to, see, themselves, as, holding, the, balance, of, power, between, the, entrenched, apparatus, and, reformers, which, for, many, explains, their, enthusiasm, for, joining, the, party, in, disproportionate, numbers, where, their, growing, power, could, be, expressed, regardless, the, economic, reforms, touched, on, both, the, nationalities, and, the, political, question, reforming, how, the, economy, operated, was, tied, to, how, the, party, operated, and, thinking, evolved, to, recognize, the, need, for, a, diversity, of, interests, to, be, represented, cultural, reform, touched, on, economic, reform, as, the, educated, groups, saw, one, of, the, principle, resources, the, economy, neglected, was, talent, technical, advance, required, abilities, that, were, neither, promoted, nor, respected, among, the, conservatives, such, as, novotn, who, were, mostly, poorly, educated, and, often, lacked, fundamental, competency, at, their, jobs, they, did, not, call, however, for, capitalism, and, class, difference, but, democratic, compensation, for, additional, time, and, expense, necessary, for, their, education, in, may, 1967, speaking, before, the, plenum, of, the, communist, party, of, slovakia, dub, ek, represented, this, rising, conviction, among, his, generation, that, rejected, the, dictatorship, of, a, single, class, of, workers, or, party, officials, instead, he, appealed, to, a, universal, all, inclusive, human, principle, that, had, as, much, in, common, with, sociology, as, marxist, leninism, in, origins, practice, and, aims, while, still, embracing, both, in, september, 1967, novotn, s, conservatives, began, to, impose, strict, censorship, on, films, and, other, culture, products, institutions, and, culture, workers, this, did, not, quiet, opposition, but, only, further, provoked, it, what, followed, was, an, unprecedented, mobilization, of, solidarity, among, culture, workers, in, both, czech, and, slovak, lands, following, his, presentation, of, grievances, the, month, before, in, october, 1967, dub, ek, and, ota, ik, challenged, first, secretary, novotn, s, leadership, style, at, a, central, committee, meeting, dub, ek, said, he, acted, like, a, dictator, faced, with, lack, of, support, at, the, central, and, local, level, of, the, party, and, large, public, demonstrations, the, last, day, of, october, that, were, badly, mishandled, provoking, further, opposition, novotn, secretly, invited, soviet, leader, leonid, brezhnev, to, visit, to, prague, in, december, 1967, he, had, hoped, to, shore, up, his, own, position, in, prague, brezhnev, was, stunned, to, learn, of, the, extent, of, the, opposition, to, novotn, he, decided, not, to, interfere, brezhnev, was, generally, supportive, of, novotny, but, said, he, was, not, there, to, solve, their, problems, he, was, there, to, help, restore, party, unity, while, the, ksc, presidium, was, deadlocked, 5, 5, in, january, 1968, the, questions, of, leadership, and, reform, were, turned, over, to, the, czechoslovak, party, central, committee, they, voted, no, confidence, in, novotn, by, splitting, the, functions, of, the, president, and, party, leader, he, remained, president, but, was, replaced, by, dub, ek, as, first, secretary, novotn, resisted, attempting, to, mobilize, elements, of, the, army, to, prevent, his, loss, of, power, ironically, investigation, into, this, led, to, novotn, being, completely, removed, from, office, a, few, months, later, investigations, by, officials, and, a, newly, freed, media, of, his, chief, accomplice, general, jan, ejna, exposed, a, corruption, scandal, involving, his, own, and, his, sons, shady, business, dealings, which, was, known, as, the, clover, seed, scandal, dub, ek, with, his, background, and, training, in, russia, was, seen, by, the, ussr, as, a, safe, pair, of, hands, our, sasha, as, brezhnev, called, him, aside, from, the, immediate, personal, and, professional, animosity, of, bulgarian, leader, todor, zhivkov, who, refused, to, acknowledge, him, directly, other, warsaw, pact, leaders, sent, customary, congratulations, zhivkov, received, a, protest, for, his, snub, from, soviet, diplomats, zhivkov, s, behavior, was, not, motivated, by, opposition, to, dub, ek, s, program, of, reforms, but, his, discomfort, at, the, manner, in, which, his, predecessor, had, been, removed, making, no, secret, where, he, was, headed, in, february, with, brezhnev, present, dub, ek, pledged, we, shall, have, to, remove, everything, that, strangles, artistic, and, scientific, creativeness, the, period, following, novotn, s, downfall, became, known, as, the, prague, spring, during, this, time, dub, ek, and, other, reformers, sought, to, liberalize, the, communist, government, creating, socialism, with, a, human, face, dub, ek, and, his, allies, aim, was, not, a, return, to, capitalism, nor, was, it, an, end, to, the, communist, party, s, rule, or, its, leading, role, in, society, it, was, socialism, marked, by, internal, democracy, unlimited, and, unconditioned, by, the, party, the, strengthening, of, the, faith, of, the, people, and, the, working, class, and, its, transformation, into, a, revolutionary, force, and, the, creative, power, of, the, party, to, that, end, the, prague, spring, sought, to, liberalize, the, existing, regime, it, continued, a, series, of, reforms, that, granted, greater, freedom, of, expression, to, the, press, and, public, rehabilitated, victims, of, stalinist, purges, by, klement, gottwald, advanced, economic, decentralization, and, supported, fundamental, human, rights, reforms, that, included, an, independent, judiciary, during, the, prague, spring, he, and, other, reform, minded, communists, enhanced, popular, support, for, the, communist, government, by, eliminating, its, repressive, features, allowing, greater, freedom, of, expression, and, tolerating, political, and, social, organizations, not, under, communist, control, dub, ek, svoboda, became, the, popular, refrain, of, student, demonstrations, during, this, period, while, a, poll, at, home, gave, him, 78, percent, public, support, dub, ek, declared, a, 10, year, program, to, implement, reforms, but, as, reforms, gained, momentum, he, struggled, to, both, maintain, control, and, move, with, events, dub, ek, had, been, a, compromise, candidate, between, more, radical, reformers, and, hard, line, conservatives, in, power, dub, ek, was, caught, between, a, powerful, hard, line, minority, in, czechoslovakia, and, their, allies, in, other, warsaw, pact, countries, who, pressured, dub, ek, to, rein, in, the, prague, spring, and, on, the, other, hand, more, radical, reformers, who, demanded, more, far, reaching, and, immediate, reforms, while, still, stressing, the, leading, role, of, the, party, and, the, centrality, of, the, warsaw, pact, dub, ek, also, was, open, to, redefining, the, duty, of, party, members, from, obedience, to, more, creative, expression, according, to, a, cia, assessment, at, the, time, dub, ek, was, seen, as, an, adept, politician, who, might, pull, the, balancing, act, off, at, home, which, if, true, made, soviet, military, intervention, all, the, more, urgently, needed, by, the, anti, reform, faction, the, soviet, politburo, may, not, have, shared, this, view, of, dub, ek, but, they, interpreted, events, as, demonstrating, dishonesty, as, much, as, lack, of, ability, in, a, phone, conversation, between, dub, ek, and, brezhnev, on, 13, august, dub, ek, complained, that, he, was, on, the, verge, of, quitting, in, frustration, having, difficulty, meeting, his, promises, because, he, was, operating, in, such, a, fluid, situation, that, planning, was, difficult, and, any, new, promises, could, just, cause, brezhnev, greater, distrust, when, those, promises, couldn, t, be, fulfilled, rapidly, the, soviet, leadership, tried, to, rein, in, events, in, czechoslovakia, through, a, series, of, negotiations, the, soviet, union, agreed, to, bilateral, talks, with, czechoslovakia, in, july, at, ierna, nad, tisou, railway, station, near, the, slovak, soviet, border, at, the, meeting, dub, ek, defended, the, reform, program, but, pledged, his, government, s, continued, commitment, to, the, warsaw, pact, and, comecon, dub, ek, promised, to, curb, the, media, and, anti, socialist, tendencies, and, prevent, the, reconstitution, of, the, social, democratic, party, in, return, the, soviets, promised, to, withdraw, troops, that, had, been, stationed, in, the, country, since, exercises, that, june, where, the, czechs, had, played, the, nato, team, despite, dub, ek, s, continuing, efforts, to, stress, these, commitments, afterward, brezhnev, and, other, warsaw, pact, leaders, told, dub, ek, they, remained, anxious, because, so, many, motives, were, hidden, behind, clandestine, activities, personal, motives, and, organizational, biases, where, even, pro, intervention, hard, liners, had, to, make, appearances, so, as, not, to, be, charged, with, treason, there, was, and, remains, confusion, as, to, soviet, motives, for, the, invasion, that, ended, the, prague, spring, some, believed, that, the, soviets, saw, even, a, partly, free, press, as, threatening, an, end, to, one, party, rule, in, czechoslovakia, and, by, extension, elsewhere, in, eastern, europe, this, is, contradicted, by, many, eyewitnesses, such, as, ken, coates, according, to, coates, the, charge, that, the, party, was, losing, control, or, that, counter, revolutionaries, were, misusing, reforms, including, press, freedom, to, undermine, the, party, position, was, laughable, saying, anyone, who, was, in, prague, and, lived, in, czechoslovakia, at, that, time, knew, that, the, party, s, authority, the, party, s, position, in, the, eyes, of, the, nation, had, improved, for, the, first, time, instead, he, said, that, the, party, discredited, itself, however, the, telephone, conversation, between, brezhnev, and, dub, ek, on, 13, august, suggests, that, media, coverage, was, given, high, importance, brezhnev, had, instructed, dub, ek, to, remove, key, people, responsible, for, the, media, specifically, pelik, n, c, sa, kriegel, and, other, scoundrels, dub, ek, s, unwillingness, or, inability, to, do, so, created, distrust, around, certain, statements, circulated, in, the, media, which, may, have, made, the, issue, more, significant, than, it, actually, was, in, itself, as, it, gave, credence, to, the, coup, plotters, press, freedom, began, as, an, opening, to, reassessment, of, the, stalinist, purges, and, the, nation, s, historic, past, but, it, grew, into, an, abstract, ideal, as, conservative, criticism, generalized, and, mounted, the, question, had, been, one, more, of, truth, telling, than, of, press, freedom, the, issues, were, more, broad, confusion, was, common, at, the, time, of, the, invasion, events, caught, much, of, the, world, by, surprise, despite, widespread, evidence, of, troop, buildups, and, continued, seeming, arbitrary, maneuvers, on, the, country, s, borders, in, an, emergency, meeting, of, the, united, states, national, security, council, called, by, president, lyndon, b, johnson, on, 20, august, defense, secretary, clark, clifford, along, with, the, cabinet, and, president, could, not, explain, soviet, actions, the, invasion, also, erupted, alongside, so, many, destabilizing, changes, that, some, have, pointed, to, press, freedom, serving, as, a, short, cut, explanation, in, a, letter, written, in, 1974, to, the, widow, of, josef, smrkovsk, a, close, political, ally, who, died, in, official, political, disgrace, that, january, dub, ek, said, he, remained, unable, to, explain, why, the, soviet, leadership, believed, distorted, reports, about, the, nature, and, aims, of, his, socialist, reforms, he, said, that, these, urgent, warnings, to, the, soviet, leadership, were, the, result, of, party, leaders, and, other, conservatives, who, saw, all, that, was, happening, solely, from, the, angle, of, the, loss, of, their, leading, role, in, the, party, anti, reformist, elements, were, a, coalition, of, hard, liners, in, the, soviet, union, such, as, yuri, andropov, whose, false, reports, of, events, in, hungary, had, also, helped, overcome, khrushchev, s, opposition, to, intervention, and, warsaw, pact, leaders, fearing, for, their, own, positions, such, as, east, german, leader, walter, ulbricht, and, polish, leader, w, adys, aw, gomu, ka, perhaps, most, significantly, false, high, level, reports, included, letters, secretly, passed, directly, to, the, soviet, politburo, by, those, within, the, czechoslovakian, regime, who, promoted, intervention, one, such, message, was, sent, to, brezhnev, at, the, time, of, the, ierna, nad, tisou, meeting, these, letters, and, reports, were, sent, by, a, group, of, anti, reformist, hard, liners, in, the, czechoslovak, communist, party, ksc, under, the, leadership, of, slovak, communist, party, chief, vasi, bi, ak, working, with, allies, in, the, stb, and, czechoslovak, army, bil, ak, later, wrote, in, his, own, memoirs, that, what, he, and, his, colleagues, feared, most, right, up, until, mid, august, was, that, dub, ek, would, reach, an, accommodation, of, compromise, with, moscow, that, would, forestall, or, prevent, an, invasion, bil, ak, himself, feared, his, own, imminent, departure, from, office, with, good, reason, his, hard, deadlines, were, august, 26, the, date, of, the, slovak, party, congress, and, august, 20, a, gathering, of, the, reformist, leadership, both, had, been, moved, up, to, allow, reformers, to, secure, better, positions, the, warnings, of, bil, ak, and, his, supporters, stoked, deliberately, exaggerated, fears, of, violent, anti, socialist, counter, revolution, as, an, imminent, threat, this, was, not, only, to, prod, the, soviets, to, quick, action, but, to, ensure, that, dub, ek, would, be, removed, and, not, even, a, moderate, reformist, government, would, remain, to, frustrate, their, personal, prerogatives, press, freedom, was, only, one, of, many, reforms, where, no, compromise, at, all, could, be, tolerated, on, the, night, of, 20, 21, august, 1968, military, forces, from, several, warsaw, pact, member, states, albania, romania, and, east, germany, did, not, participate, invaded, czechoslovakia, soviet, media, cited, a, call, for, help, from, unnamed, representatives, as, the, cause, of, the, fraternal, intervention, publishing, an, unidentified, appeal, as, proof, on, 22, august, 1968, however, as, it, became, clear, from, the, first, day, that, virtually, the, entire, responsible, leadership, of, the, czechoslovakian, government, and, communist, parties, including, dub, ek, were, being, blamed, as, causes, of, the, invasion, and, even, the, soviet, supported, leadership, fell, into, accusations, against, each, other, most, allied, communist, parties, around, the, world, rejected, the, soviet, pretext, as, a, thin, disguise, for, gross, violation, of, national, party, autonomy, even, president, ludv, k, svoboda, had, publicly, issued, a, statement, calling, on, occupying, forces, to, withdraw, and, for, reforms, to, continue, while, czechoslovakia, s, un, representatives, were, calling, for, international, support, against, the, invasion, the, soviets, were, only, partly, responsible, for, their, confusion, closely, following, a, long, telephone, conversation, between, bil, ak, and, brezhnev, on, 10, august, two, of, bil, ak, s, most, important, allies, met, with, the, soviet, ambassador, to, czechoslovakia, on, 14, 15, august, alois, indra, who, along, with, drahomir, kolder, had, previously, been, in, direct, contact, with, the, soviet, politburo, was, accompanied, by, another, ksc, hard, liner, old, ich, pavlovsk, in, their, meeting, with, ambassador, stepan, chervonenko, they, assured, him, that, as, soon, as, soviet, troops, move, into, action, on, the, night, of, 20, august, the, healthy, forces, in, the, ksc, would, carry, out, their, plan, of, action, to, oust, dub, ek, setting, up, a, provisional, revolutionary, government, of, workers, and, peasants, indra, said, he, could, guarantee, that, a, majority, of, the, ksc, presidium, the, ksc, central, committee, the, national, assembly, and, the, czechoslovak, government, would, join, with, the, healthy, forces, he, promised, six, of, the, eleven, members, of, the, ksc, presidium, and, 50, members, of, the, ksc, central, committee, as, his, supporters, the, soviet, politburo, received, many, such, appeals, for, intervention, misleading, them, into, confidence, the, viability, of, a, hard, liner, government, in, waiting, the, kgb, had, also, buried, reports, that, the, us, and, the, federal, republic, of, germany, were, not, behind, the, prague, spring, kgb, station, chief, in, washington, dc, oleg, kalugin, only, discovered, years, later, that, the, kgb, leadership, had, ordered, his, reports, destroyed, and, not, shown, to, anyone, after, they, received, what, kalugin, thought, was, a, more, balanced, assessment, meanwhile, kgb, reports, to, the, soviet, leadership, went, to, lengths, to, support, the, official, narrative, and, the, claims, of, anti, reform, hard, liners, they, blamed, everything, negative, that, happened, in, czechoslovakia, on, the, prague, spring, including, in, some, cases, traffic, crashes, fires, and, burglaries, the, kgb, even, manufactured, evidence, directing, agents, to, plant, cashes, of, american, made, weapons, near, the, german, border, in, order, to, be, discovered, they, instructed, agents, to, hang, posters, calling, for, the, overthrow, of, communism, this, was, to, prove, a, western, sponsored, network, was, active, in, dub, ek, s, reform, movement, as, part, of, an, imminent, insurrection, or, coup, the, kgb, was, only, further, enraged, when, the, czechoslovakian, interior, minister, revealed, it, all, to, be, a, deliberate, soviet, provocation, the, kgb, had, many, reasons, for, their, actions, but, most, important, may, have, been, its, institutional, bias, the, pillar, commission, set, up, to, investigate, the, show, trials, of, the, 1950s, recommended, the, disbandment, of, the, secret, police, and, czechoslovakian, security, services, had, already, ceased, most, cooperation, with, the, kgb, having, a, major, impact, on, the, kgbs, operational, effectiveness, and, influence, the, czech, security, services, had, been, vital, to, their, effective, operations, some, suggest, further, that, they, may, have, feared, eventual, reprisals, against, their, most, active, and, loyal, agents, within, the, stb, and, interior, ministry, this, motive, is, partly, supported, by, the, guarantees, against, reprisals, against, pro, soviet, czechoslovakians, in, the, moscow, protocols, the, kgb, was, also, upset, when, czechoslovak, interior, minister, josef, pavel, revealed, the, existence, of, six, kgb, liaison, agents, within, his, office, implying, that, they, would, be, removed, in, an, atmosphere, of, conformity, cultivated, by, brezhnev, only, a, few, in, the, kremlin, voiced, skepticism, such, as, gennady, voronov, who, asked, whom, was, it, really, so, necessary, for, us, to, defend, and, from, whom, bil, ak, would, join, indra, in, reassuring, the, soviets, promising, that, kolder, would, be, ready, to, be, voted, the, ksc, first, secretary, when, soviet, troops, arrived, when, two, of, their, promised, allies, on, the, presidium, jan, piller, and, franti, ek, barb, rek, opposed, the, invasion, and, supported, dub, ek, soviet, plans, had, to, be, abandoned, this, forced, them, to, retain, dub, ek, and, his, government, until, the, following, year, when, dub, ek, s, government, could, no, longer, contain, growing, pressure, to, advance, reforms, once, again, coming, both, from, within, and, without, the, party, the, day, of, the, invasion, occupying, armies, quickly, seized, control, of, prague, and, the, central, committee, s, building, taking, dub, ek, and, other, reformers, into, soviet, custody, but, before, they, were, arrested, dub, ek, urged, the, people, not, to, resist, militarily, on, the, grounds, that, presenting, a, military, defense, would, have, meant, exposing, the, czech, and, slovak, peoples, to, a, senseless, bloodbath, already, the, previous, month, when, officers, under, general, v, clav, prchl, k, head, of, the, ksc, s, military, department, began, preparing, contingency, plans, for, a, soviet, warsaw, pact, invasion, dub, ek, had, immediately, vetoed, its, implementation, in, the, early, hours, of, the, attack, czechoslovakian, radio, broadcast, an, appeal, to, citizens, not, to, resist, the, presidium, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, czechoslovakia, asked, all, citizens, of, the, republic, to, keep, the, peace, and, remain, at, their, posts, but, not, resist, the, advancing, armies, because, the, defense, of, our, state, borders, is, now, impossible, by, making, this, official, declaration, before, soviet, troops, could, preempt, functioning, of, the, official, government, the, czechoslovakian, leadership, ensured, that, both, the, invasion, and, soviet, invitation, would, be, seen, as, illegitimate, but, also, established, the, political, and, strategic, framework, for, the, resistance, as, symbolic, and, moral, where, their, opponent, would, have, less, control, controversy, at, that, time, and, since, has, arisen, as, to, whether, dub, ek, knew, of, the, invasion, and, hid, the, fact, for, his, own, reasons, perhaps, explaining, some, of, the, world, s, surprise, some, point, to, the, telephone, conversation, between, brezhnev, and, dub, ek, on, 13, august, where, dub, ek, is, recorded, to, say, if, you, on, the, soviet, politburo, believe, we, re, deceiving, you, you, should, take, the, measure, you, regard, as, appropriate, brezhnev, is, recorded, to, respond, such, measures, would, be, easier, for, us, to, adopt, if, you, and, your, comrades, would, more, openly, say, that, these, are, the, measures, you, re, expecting, of, us, historians, have, never, accepted, dub, ek, s, foreknowledge, and, dub, ek, has, always, denied, it, but, czech, resistance, was, somewhat, unconventional, and, much, is, shrouded, in, ambiguity, that, created, an, open, question, for, some, the, non, violent, resistance, of, the, czech, and, slovak, population, which, helped, delay, pacification, by, warsaw, pact, forces, for, over, eight, months, in, contrast, to, the, soviet, military, s, estimate, of, four, days, became, an, example, of, civilian, based, defense, a, latter, day, the, good, soldier, vejk, referring, to, an, early, 20th, century, czech, satirical, novel, wrote, of, the, comradely, pranks, of, changing, street, names, and, road, signs, of, pretending, not, to, understand, russian, and, of, putting, out, a, great, variety, of, humorous, welcoming, posters, meanwhile, for, a, short, time, government, radio, stations, called, for, the, invaders, to, return, home, long, live, freedom, svoboda, dub, ek, dub, ek, was, arrested, before, dawn, when, 3, security, officers, revolvers, in, hand, and, accompanied, by, several, soldiers, with, machine, guns, bust, into, his, office, one, of, them, cut, the, telephone, wires, while, another, began, to, cuff, him, when, dub, ek, protested, he, was, beaten, his, driver, attempted, to, intervene, and, was, immediately, shot, dub, ek, was, told, we, will, kill, if, necessary, a, million, czechs, threatened, one, of, the, officers, to, put, an, end, to, your, counter, revolution, later, on, the, day, of, the, invasion, dub, ek, along, with, premier, old, ich, ern, k, jozef, smrkovsky, and, frantisek, kriegel, were, taken, to, the, soviet, union, at, first, dub, ek, was, taken, to, a, mountain, cottage, in, the, ukraine, however, upon, encountering, massive, popular, resistance, to, their, planned, coup, and, president, svoboda, and, other, czech, representatives, who, were, still, in, prague, refusing, to, accept, any, agreement, made, without, approval, of, the, official, representatives, of, the, party, the, soviets, changed, tactics, and, sent, him, to, moscow, for, negotiations, on, 24, august, soviet, representatives, presented, the, moscow, protocol, rejecting, a, counter, proposal, offered, by, dub, ek, s, aides, they, said, it, was, non, negotiable, the, only, alternative, was, soviet, imposition, of, a, military, dictatorship, now, that, their, illusions, of, being, welcomed, as, liberators, proved, false, dub, ek, and, other, detainees, were, repeatedly, beaten, during, their, detention, and, dub, ek, reports, he, was, drugged, with, sedatives, to, make, him, more, compliant, resisting, nonetheless, dub, ek, s, team, gained, minor, but, significant, concessions, including, refusing, to, accept, soviet, justifications, for, the, invasion, or, the, right, of, the, soviet, union, or, any, other, country, to, decide, their, country, s, future, as, well, as, not, agreeing, to, the, immediate, reversal, of, all, reforms, in, the, end, dub, ek, said, they, were, forced, to, sign, in, order, to, avoid, bloodshed, in, the, room, and, back, at, home, with, only, franti, ek, kriegel, refusing, to, sign, this, ended, the, prague, spring, and, set, the, stage, for, a, moscow, directed, reversal, of, reforms, that, dub, ek, was, compelled, to, sell, and, implement, dub, ek, and, most, of, the, reformers, were, returned, to, prague, on, 27, august, at, the, time, the, moscow, protocol, was, intended, to, be, a, secret, document, it, was, revealed, to, party, members, the, subsequent, week, and, then, leaked, to, the, new, york, times, throughout, the, rest, of, the, year, dub, ek, and, other, senior, leaders, were, called, back, to, moscow, repeatedly, to, receive, new, demands, which, they, returned, home, to, deliver, to, their, people, this, led, dub, ek, to, consider, quitting, under, extreme, duress, at, times, but, he, always, recovered, the, soviets, made, no, attempt, to, hide, their, contempt, when, dub, ek, protested, that, he, had, already, met, the, terms, of, the, moscow, protocol, he, is, reported, to, have, been, told, to, shut, up, by, soviet, president, nikolai, podgorny, the, czechoslovakian, team, were, told, that, the, soviets, would, continue, to, turn, the, screws, harder, undeterred, by, the, protests, of, other, communist, parties, they, dismissed, them, saying, for, the, next, 30, or, 40, years, socialism, has, no, chance, in, the, capitalist, west, gustav, hus, k, reported, they, were, treated, as, scoundrels, in, january, 1969, dub, ek, was, hospitalized, in, bratislava, complaining, of, a, cold, and, had, to, cancel, a, speech, rumors, sprang, up, that, his, illness, was, radiation, sickness, and, that, it, was, caused, by, radioactive, strontium, being, placed, in, his, soup, during, his, stay, in, moscow, in, an, attempt, to, kill, him, however, a, u, s, intelligence, report, discounted, this, for, lack, of, evidence, also, that, month, following, the, self, immolation, of, jan, palach, reformers, renewed, their, offensive, against, conservative, hardliners, dub, ek, pledged, to, hold, the, line, against, both, reformers, and, neo, stalinists, but, opposition, was, moving, outside, the, party, for, tactical, reasons, dub, ek, was, forced, to, resign, as, first, secretary, in, april, 1969, following, the, czechoslovak, hockey, riots, the, soviets, were, not, only, alarmed, by, dub, ek, s, failure, to, contain, growing, pressure, to, resume, reforms, but, at, their, own, failures, to, consolidate, a, neo, stalinist, regime, under, indra, or, their, other, allies, dub, ek, was, replaced, by, former, reformer, gustav, hus, k, beginning, a, process, of, normalization, that, would, eventually, purge, two, thirds, of, the, party, and, de, politicize, the, country, at, the, time, leonid, brezhnev, is, supposed, to, have, said, if, we, cannot, find, the, puppets, then, we, will, tie, the, strings, to, the, leaders, though, no, longer, party, leader, dub, ek, had, been, re, elected, to, the, federal, assembly, as, the, federal, parliament, was, renamed, in, 1969, dub, ek, became, chairman, on, april, 28, following, the, violent, suppression, of, protests, by, new, domestic, czech, security, forces, dub, ek, signed, the, baton, law, into, effect, in, august, hus, k, had, sent, this, to, the, federal, assembly, to, expand, legal, powers, of, suppression, of, dissent, dub, ek, would, later, call, this, the, gravest, mistake, of, his, life, the, baton, law, was, widely, seen, as, the, end, of, hope, for, successful, resistance, despite, his, continued, cooperation, dub, ek, was, removed, from, parliamentary, office, on, october, 15, under, prime, minister, cernik, s, new, government, though, cernik, tried, to, placate, reformists, the, new, government, s, extreme, anti, reformist, faction, led, by, deputy, party, chief, lubom, r, trougal, wanted, to, put, dub, ek, on, trial, hus, k, who, styled, himself, as, a, post, ideological, realist, as, well, as, moscow, wanted, to, avoid, a, destabilizing, return, to, stalinism, instead, dub, ek, was, sent, into, diplomatic, exile, to, turkey, from, head, of, a, nation, of, millions, and, leader, of, 1, 6, million, party, members, he, went, to, heading, a, 7, person, staff, this, left, him, conveniently, out, of, the, country, while, more, aggressive, purges, began, in, earnest, some, suggested, at, the, time, it, would, be, too, dangerous, to, post, him, anywhere, within, the, soviet, bloc, where, he, was, widely, regarded, as, a, hero, hus, k, was, also, said, to, have, feared, that, direct, persecution, of, dub, ek, might, stir, more, instability, than, it, would, promote, some, thought, that, hus, k, s, reluctance, to, trials, and, executions, was, because, of, his, own, experiences, as, a, prisoner, though, he, thought, his, own, imprisonment, was, wrong, he, had, no, problem, with, imprisoning, state, enemies, on, general, principle, or, personal, feeling, others, suggest, that, it, was, the, hard, liners, themselves, who, wanted, dub, ek, out, of, the, country, to, isolate, him, from, the, public, and, to, prevent, him, becoming, a, martyr, as, trials, had, never, helped, the, communist, regime, either, within, the, country, or, internationally, alan, levy, a, journalist, who, witnessed, the, prague, spring, explained, hus, k, s, reluctance, with, a, comparison, hungary, was, able, to, relax, its, repressive, grip, within, less, than, 5, years, after, the, soviet, invasion, but, czechoslovakia, and, its, former, leaders, remained, in, a, state, of, limbo, rather, than, hell, that, would, eventually, last, for, decades, this, he, explained, as, because, unlike, hungary, czechoslovakia, had, no, real, revolt, to, liquidate, instead, he, and, the, soviets, had, to, invent, a, counter, revolution, not, prosecute, it, however, in, june, of, that, same, year, dub, ek, was, dismissed, from, his, ambassadorial, post, and, recalled, from, turkey, after, being, suspended, from, the, party, pending, an, investigation, by, hard, liners, this, was, read, as, a, signal, that, hus, k, had, lost, a, behind, the, scenes, power, struggle, against, the, hard, line, faction, led, by, trougal, indra, and, balik, they, had, taken, control, of, the, presidium, by, a, margin, of, 7, to, 4, voting, to, prepare, a, series, of, trials, against, reformers, on, charges, of, espionage, sedition, and, slander, of, the, republic, at, the, time, some, suggested, that, dub, ek, s, and, his, reformer, allies, fates, may, have, been, spared, by, the, chance, drunk, driving, crash, that, saved, hus, k, from, removal, himself, the, resulting, investigation, uncovered, a, conspiracy, by, ultra, conservatives, to, remove, hus, k, who, were, themselves, removed, others, said, that, this, threat, was, part, of, an, attempt, to, force, dub, ek, to, defect, to, the, west, using, his, wife, and, children, as, hostages, in, ankara, the, only, debate, within, ruling, circles, was, how, best, to, isolate, dub, ek, from, the, public, by, some, form, of, character, assassination, they, wanted, him, reassigned, to, a, position, as, a, senior, officer, in, the, pension, insurance, research, institute, to, entrap, him, in, a, scandal, after, having, failed, to, pressure, dub, ek, to, leave, under, a, cloud, as, a, defector, which, would, discredit, him, as, a, loyal, party, member, dub, ek, found, himself, a, permanent, free, range, prisoner, along, with, many, others, purged, from, the, party, and, blacklisted, from, work, the, purge, of, the, party, resulted, in, a, general, decline, in, membership, from, 1, 6, million, at, the, time, that, dub, ek, rose, to, power, to, 880, 000, by, the, end, of, 1970, more, purges, would, follow, as, loyalists, replaced, the, able, careerists, those, who, otherwise, cooperated, to, advance, their, careers, even, among, those, who, remained, members, by, the, end, of, 1970, many, either, refused, their, cards, or, had, not, paid, their, dues, the, reduction, in, numbers, was, accompanied, by, a, qualitative, change, in, the, party, where, the, party, that, dub, ek, headed, as, leader, of, the, post, stalinist, generation, of, idealists, was, gone, the, majority, of, members, were, over, 60, years, old, and, ideology, had, virtually, disappeared, even, among, conservatives, dub, ek, and, his, communist, reformers, had, proven, so, popular, that, the, only, way, to, root, them, out, of, the, political, fabric, of, the, nation, was, to, eradicate, communist, ideology, to, do, so, required, to, virtually, remove, an, entire, generation, from, the, party, even, czechoslovakian, universities, ceased, to, teach, marxism, for, lack, of, reliable, instructors, any, kind, of, political, belief, in, rapid, succession, would, be, grounds, for, suspicion, leaving, a, disaffected, population, for, dub, ek, and, many, others, this, did, not, mean, a, return, to, private, life, but, a, different, kind, of, political, life, where, in, dub, ek, s, case, his, career, in, high, politics, would, be, deferred, at, home, while, he, served, as, an, inspirational, symbol, of, eurocommunist, ideals, abroad, meanwhile, he, struggled, to, personally, survive, repressions, at, home, outwardly, he, shifted, to, menial, work, that, many, educated, reformers, were, forced, to, take, turning, down, a, post, at, a, slovak, social, security, agency, that, could, be, used, to, implicate, him, in, the, misappropriation, of, funds, he, instead, requested, to, work, as, a, forester, this, was, refused, but, he, was, eventually, given, a, clerical, job, with, the, state, forestry, agency, in, bratislava, he, was, still, investigated, at, work, but, wrong, doing, could, never, be, found, after, his, expulsion, from, the, party, dub, ek, became, a, nonperson, whose, very, mention, was, banned, in, 1988, he, told, voice, of, america, that, what, he, had, been, through, could, not, be, described, as, life, in, the, normal, sense, of, the, word, but, rather, a, matter, of, survival, interpretations, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, treated, him, as, a, man, who, had, lost, relevancy, due, to, prolonged, isolation, in, an, enforced, private, life, in, fact, his, life, became, anything, but, private, surveillance, was, constant, and, intrusive, perhaps, he, simply, outlived, the, narrative, that, had, confined, him, as, much, the, police, had, but, he, was, not, politically, unimportant, while, the, first, news, reports, during, the, normalization, period, 1970, 74, show, a, man, who, actively, avoided, attention, and, was, shifting, uncertainly, between, insecure, employment, telling, a, west, german, photographer, please, sir, please, sir, if, you, like, to, help, me, come, not, to, me, school, girls, giggled, saying, all, they, were, told, at, school, was, that, he, had, done, something, bad, other, reports, saw, him, as, a, man, living, securely, but, anonymously, with, his, wife, and, children, in, a, comfortable, villa, in, a, nice, neighborhood, in, bratislava, this, seems, to, have, been, the, official, fable, as, no, evidence, suggests, this, being, a, wholly, accurate, picture, when, in, 1975, authorities, turned, to, prosecute, his, wife, anna, she, presented, evidence, of, the, insecure, position, of, the, entire, family, and, personal, friends, denied, proper, medical, care, her, sons, denied, apartments, the, armed, guards, posted, at, their, home, that, made, them, fear, its, seizure, and, her, own, nervous, condition, and, health, problems, from, constant, surveillance, and, persecution, an, entire, politics, arose, around, the, false, portrayal, of, the, stability, security, and, privilege, of, the, dub, eks, private, life, in, part, to, make, plausible, that, dub, ek, was, at, liberty, to, be, heavily, involved, in, counter, revolutionary, activities, dub, ek, was, described, as, variously, a, spy, master, or, when, proven, not, to, be, or, when, misrepresented, by, either, the, regime, or, others, as, a, self, absorbed, and, simple, minded, marionette, of, powerful, external, forces, living, a, self, indulgent, private, life, insulated, from, political, participation, and, understanding, complaints, such, as, that, dub, ek, s, sons, were, given, high, marks, and, admitted, to, university, were, described, by, one, writer, as, self, righteous, vengefulness, of, the, soviet, sycophants, within, the, regime, dub, ek, would, say, he, first, broke, his, silence, by, publishing, letters, he, smuggled, out, of, the, country, after, he, was, denied, the, right, to, bury, his, mother, in, daylight, in, 1974, for, fear, it, would, provoke, an, anti, government, demonstration, dub, ek, s, public, letters, to, other, parties, and, to, the, national, assembly, were, part, of, a, larger, international, campaign, by, purged, members, gradually, being, joined, by, many, high, profile, figures, outside, czechoslovakia, and, other, domestic, activists, this, campaign, was, spurred, by, international, publication, of, the, memoirs, of, josef, smrkovsk, as, well, as, the, sometimes, described, hysterical, reaction, of, husak, to, dub, ek, s, both, real, and, invented, transgressions, and, writings, this, ultimately, gave, dub, ek, a, greater, voice, through, anti, regime, allies, and, provoked, dub, ek, further, in, self, preservation, when, in, september, 1975, as, husak, intensified, repressions, following, his, consolidation, of, leadership, positions, dub, ek, reacted, to, interrogation, by, refusing, to, deny, the, information, being, leaked, or, protesting, the, false, use, of, his, name, counter, threatening, to, act, decisively, if, repressive, measures, were, taken, against, him, the, former, leader, of, the, prague, spring, in, fact, had, much, in, common, with, eurocommunist, tendencies, there, were, common, challenges, in, the, countries, of, the, east, and, west, caught, between, the, superpowers, but, seeking, to, both, heal, the, division, of, europe, and, gain, autonomy, from, the, influence, of, great, power, politics, eurocommunism, sought, to, unify, the, european, labor, movement, and, participate, fully, in, parliamentary, and, internal, democracy, decentralize, and, steer, an, independent, course, not, only, did, this, bring, them, into, direct, conflict, with, the, soviet, union, during, the, crackdown, against, the, solidarity, trade, union, but, they, had, been, in, open, disagreement, with, moscow, over, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1968, the, clash, was, less, public, but, just, as, clear, in, a, restricted, meeting, of, the, italian, communist, party, enrico, berlinguer, told, members, to, prepare, their, base, for, a, clash, with, the, soviet, leadership, over, the, invasion, dub, ek, had, a, long, history, of, contact, with, not, only, the, italian, communist, party, but, with, its, newspaper, l, unita, and, its, journalists, a, highly, favorable, article, about, him, in, l, unit, on, june, 29, 1970, reporting, his, expulsion, from, the, party, portrayed, him, as, a, social, democratic, communist, seeking, to, change, the, ruling, style, of, the, party, he, struck, of, popular, cord, with, italian, audiences, and, remained, a, popular, symbol, of, shared, ideals, under, constant, surveillance, and, separated, from, his, domestic, contacts, it, was, in, many, ways, easier, for, him, to, make, contact, with, western, communist, media, and, parties, than, with, his, own, party, and, people, he, saw, this, use, of, intermediaries, as, the, natural, course, of, action, stating, in, a, letter, to, the, italian, communist, party, since, the, matter, of, the, political, path, in, the, communist, party, has, become, international, it, cannot, remain, internal, at, this, time, after, the, expulsion, of, almost, 600, 000, communists, from, the, party, and, their, civil, and, social, disenfranchisement, to, our, laws, and, the, constitution, of, czechoslovakia, the, crisis, in, the, party, deepened, even, more, a, gradual, starting, point, can, only, come, with, the, help, of, other, communist, parties, of, socialist, countries, and, other, communist, parties, especially, european, ones, helping, other, communist, parties, cannot, be, understood, as, interfering, in, the, internal, affairs, of, another, communist, party, because, it, has, long, since, become, an, international, matter, dub, ek, s, relationship, with, italian, communists, would, lead, to, his, first, direct, public, interview, which, prodded, the, university, of, bologna, into, offering, him, an, honorary, doctorate, as, a, man, who, could, bridge, the, differences, between, the, east, and, west, his, trip, to, italy, in, 1988, and, the, public, recognition, he, gained, from, both, the, timing, and, prestige, of, an, award, he, shared, with, nelson, mandela, marked, his, return, to, high, politics, this, was, at, a, time, when, perestroika, was, finally, breaking, through, to, the, soviet, bloc, nations, outside, the, soviet, union, this, led, directly, to, his, partial, rehabilitation, as, well, as, a, return, to, public, life, immediately, after, receiving, the, award, dub, ek, was, congratulated, by, rudolf, slansky, jr, son, of, rudolf, sl, nsk, who, pointed, to, his, importance, as, not, only, a, symbol, of, the, prague, spring, but, also, a, symbol, of, inevitable, changes, in, czechoslovakia, and, a, real, political, alternative, in, 1989, he, was, awarded, the, annual, sakharov, prize, in, its, second, year, of, existence, in, 1989, before, the, anniversary, of, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, the, slovak, members, of, the, movement, for, civil, freedoms, hos, decided, to, commemorate, the, event, by, laying, flowers, as, the, locations, of, those, in, slovakia, who, had, been, killed, five, of, the, organizers, signed, the, letter, announcing, it, they, were, promptly, arrested, and, came, to, be, known, as, the, bratislava, five, on, november, 14, 1989, the, final, day, of, the, trial, of, the, bratislava, five, a, crowd, gathered, in, front, of, the, bratislava, justice, palace, as, miroslav, kus, recollects, dub, ek, accompanied, him, and, the, gathered, mass, of, people, began, to, spontaneously, calling, to, him, to, say, something, they, lifted, him, onto, their, shoulders, and, he, spoke, from, there, talking, about, political, rights, and, freedoms, thus, on, a, subject, related, to, the, process, as, kus, said, it, was, actually, the, first, political, speech, at, a, public, manifestation, marking, the, very, beginning, of, the, revolutionary, changes, in, slovakia, in, november, 1989, on, 17, november, dub, ek, attended, the, students, march, at, albertov, in, the, prague, 2, municipal, district, fearing, he, would, give, a, speech, the, stb, arrested, dub, ek, releasing, him, the, next, morning, this, was, said, to, mark, the, last, arrest, of, an, opposition, leader, martin, b, tora, one, of, the, founders, of, public, against, violence, vpn, recounted, dub, ek, s, appearance, at, slovak, national, uprising, square, on, 23, november, as, alexander, dub, ek, descending, directly, from, heaven, from, non, existence, because, the, man, had, not, existed, for, twenty, years, being, pushed, into, the, background, not, only, as, a, politician, but, also, as, a, human, being, but, now, a, vpn, leader, as, a, remover, of, a, curse, liberation, from, fear, we, wanted, to, show, to, the, party, leadership, that, they, met, with, a, united, opposition, we, just, needed, to, give, a, clear, enough, signal, of, at, what, expense, a, violent, intervention, would, be, made, on, november, 19, the, civic, forum, headed, by, charter, 77, member, v, clav, havel, was, established, to, oppose, the, communist, government, several, hundred, thousand, individuals, demonstrated, against, the, communist, government, in, prague, on, november, 20, 28, 1989, the, night, after, his, appearance, at, slovak, national, uprising, square, on, 24, november, dub, ek, appeared, with, havel, on, a, balcony, overlooking, wenceslas, square, where, he, was, greeted, with, tremendous, applause, from, the, throngs, of, protesters, below, and, embraced, as, a, symbol, of, democratic, freedom, several, onlookers, even, chanted, dub, ek, na, hrad, dub, ek, to, the, castle, i, e, dub, ek, for, president, the, crowd, was, divided, by, his, calling, this, new, revolution, a, chance, to, continue, the, work, he, had, started, 20, years, earlier, and, prune, out, what, was, wrong, with, communism, by, this, time, most, of, the, protesters, wanted, nothing, to, do, with, communism, of, any, sort, later, that, night, dub, ek, was, on, stage, with, havel, at, the, laterna, magika, theatre, the, headquarters, of, civic, forum, when, the, entire, leadership, of, the, communist, party, resigned, this, resignation, in, effect, ended, communist, rule, in, czechoslovakia, while, the, show, of, a, united, front, was, necessary, for, the, revolution, of, 1989, it, would, later, prove, a, political, embarrassment, for, some, who, vied, for, power, against, later, regime, opponents, they, dismissed, dub, ek, as, a, symbol, of, the, past, rather, than, the, future, this, reflected, a, division, between, the, youth, movements, sometimes, called, the, jacobins, that, wanted, nothing, to, do, with, the, past, and, the, older, generation, that, was, seen, by, them, as, too, lenient, and, accommodating, many, of, these, arguments, are, obscured, by, politics, the, political, rivalry, between, hus, k, and, dub, ek, which, also, was, said, to, have, features, of, personal, animosity, stemming, from, hus, k, s, conviction, that, dub, ek, was, personally, to, blame, for, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, continued, to, have, repercussions, even, after, the, fall, of, the, regime, in, november, 1989, by, appointing, the, slovak, mari, n, alfa, as, prime, minister, of, the, federal, government, the, day, before, his, abdication, from, the, office, of, president, of, the, republic, which, took, place, on, december, 10, 1989, some, charge, that, hus, k, deliberately, pre, empted, dub, ek, by, indirectly, enabling, the, election, of, v, clav, havel, for, the, office, of, czechoslovak, president, dub, ek, s, popularity, throughout, czechoslovakia, was, high, giving, him, a, very, good, chance, of, winning, direct, election, for, president, however, he, lacked, support, from, the, prominent, figures, in, the, november, revolution, they, supported, charter, 77, member, havel, and, a, new, generation, of, leaders, when, dub, ek, himself, was, asked, to, explain, this, division, he, said, that, the, younger, generation, were, unable, to, distinguish, between, his, generation, of, reformist, communists, and, the, generation, of, communists, who, came, before, he, saw, the, consequence, of, this, post, velvet, revolution, as, creating, a, weakened, democratic, front, against, the, narrow, minded, and, dogmatic, dub, ek, said, this, was, not, the, first, nor, the, last, time, in, history, when, any, revolution, reaches, a, certain, stage, it, starts, devouring, its, own, children, according, to, a, member, of, charter, 77, petru, ka, ustrov, the, younger, generation, had, not, forgotten, that, it, was, dub, ek, who, signed, the, baton, law, and, his, fellow, reformers, who, assisted, in, pacification, of, the, country, she, explains, that, a, culture, of, trust, had, been, lost, it, was, politically, and, economically, impossible, to, continue, where, we, had, left, off, in, 1968, the, times, had, changed, and, so, had, the, people, while, havel, became, president, on, december, 28, 1989, dub, ek, was, elected, chairman, of, the, federal, assembly, holding, this, position, until, the, parliamentary, elections, in, june, 1992, true, to, his, past, dedication, to, eurocommunism, prior, to, this, on, december, 16, he, welcomed, the, delegation, of, the, italian, socialist, party, headed, by, its, chairman, bettino, craxi, in, prague, he, also, met, luciano, antonetti, as, a, journalist, and, an, old, friend, antonetti, interviewed, dub, ek, for, the, newspaper, l, unita, on, the, eve, of, the, presidential, election, in, the, interview, dub, ek, said, this, time, with, the, european, left, i, am, thinking, of, the, next, spring, but, he, emphasized, that, i, will, remain, outside, the, communist, party, even, if, it, is, renewed, throughout, 1990, 92, dub, ek, continued, intensive, contacts, with, italian, communists, and, socialists, including, visits, to, italy, where, he, was, awarded, honorary, citizenship, in, many, italian, cities, in, 1990, dub, ek, gave, the, commencement, address, to, the, college, of, arts, and, sciences, at, the, american, university, school, of, international, service, in, the, united, states, he, called, czechoslovakia, s, fight, against, the, soviet, invasion, a, moral, victory, gorbachev, would, have, agreed, when, he, said, we, thought, that, we, had, strangled, the, prague, spring, while, in, reality, we, had, strangled, ourselves, in, 1992, after, long, serving, as, an, independent, he, became, leader, of, the, social, democratic, party, of, slovakia, and, represented, that, party, in, the, federal, assembly, at, that, time, dub, ek, ambiguously, supported, the, federal, union, between, czechs, and, slovaks, against, the, ultimately, successful, push, towards, an, independent, slovak, state, however, once, it, was, clear, that, an, independent, slovak, republic, had, become, inevitable, at, the, same, time, historically, as, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, and, other, events, many, assumed, dub, ek, would, become, its, first, president, its, work, completed, the, charter, 77, movement, disbanded, on, november, 3, 1992, four, days, before, dub, ek, died, of, injuries, from, a, car, crash, the, federal, assembly, voted, for, the, dissolution, of, czechoslovakia, on, november, 25, 1992, czechoslovakia, was, formally, dissolved, on, december, 31, 1992, with, that, slovakia, became, an, independent, republic, dub, ek, died, on, 7, november, 1992, as, a, result, of, injuries, sustained, in, a, car, crash, that, took, place, on, 1, september, on, the, czech, d1, highway, near, humpolec, 20, days, short, of, his, 71st, birthday, he, was, buried, in, sl, vi, ie, dolie, cemetery, in, bratislava, slovakia, his, death, remained, an, open, question, to, some, with, allegations, of, involvement, by, either, then, prime, minister, of, slovakia, vladim, r, me, iar, or, the, kgb, an, investigation, was, reopened, when, some, members, of, his, social, democratic, party, demanded, it, a, second, investigation, ruled, that, the, death, was, due, to, aquaplaning, at, excessive, speed, in, rainy, weather, the, driver, was, reportedly, given, a, 12, month, sentence, for, speeding, however, his, son, pavol, dub, ek, said, afterward, he, remained, skeptical, saying, there, were, still, many, unclear, things, about, his, father, s, death, that, he, does, not, understand, in, an, interview, he, said, he, still, remained, skeptical, in, 2019, as, he, would, remain, for, the, rest, of, his, life, alexander, dub, ek, s, wife, anna, died, in, 1990, they, were, survived, by, three, sons, pavol, who, became, a, surgeon, and, traumatologist, peter, who, became, an, economist, and, milan, alexander, and, anna, s, first, son, was, still, born, without, dub, ek, czechoslovakian, reforms, may, have, taken, a, more, technocratic, form, that, didn, t, include, revival, of, slovak, culture, and, the, opening, of, arts, to, more, fluid, and, interdisciplinary, forms, that, were, exported, by, joint, ventures, and, the, diaspora, of, artists, after, the, soviet, crackdown, politically, the, prague, spring, may, have, been, more, contained, to, czechoslovakia, many, soviet, reformers, such, as, sakharov, would, have, lacked, the, concrete, inspiration, that, came, from, the, reforms, dub, ek, guided, particularly, the, revolt, against, stagnation, the, invasion, of, prague, started, the, true, dissident, movement, in, russia, an, abyss, opened, up, between, them, and, the, system, which, was, a, catastrophic, harbinger, of, change, without, prague, there, would, have, been, no, perestroika, dub, ek, s, style, of, leadership, and, the, ultimate, frustration, of, his, program, by, soviet, intervention, also, had, a, deep, impact, on, the, development, and, orientation, of, communist, and, socialist, parties, and, thinkers, in, the, west, dub, ek, also, left, a, legacy, of, might, have, beens, and, what, ifs, historians, and, the, public, will, continue, to, speculate, what, may, have, happened, had, he, not, died, from, a, car, crash, or, had, his, time, in, leadership, of, the, prague, spring, not, been, interrupted, by, soviet, intervention, one, obituary, speculates, that, had, he, become, the, slovak, president, his, influence, over, the, new, country, would, have, charted, a, more, immediately, inclusive, course, toward, europe, dub, ek, himself, has, been, remembered, in, artistic, representations, in, many, cultures, and, times, in, 1984, french, singer, and, songwriter, alice, dona, had, released, a, song, named, le, jardinier, de, bratislava, with, the, lyrics, written, by, claude, lemesle, as, an, apolitical, song, about, love, and, longing, for, freedom, the, song, was, inspired, by, a, trip, of, a, french, television, crew, to, visit, dub, ek, in, his, villa, near, slav, n, bratislava, they, were, denied, the, access, by, the, tb, secret, police, the, sole, footage, collected, of, dub, ek, was, of, him, attending, to, his, garden, in, 1990, the, film, invasion, a, dramatization, of, the, soviet, invasion, was, edited, by, producers, to, include, translated, commentary, by, alexander, dub, ek, responding, to, their, interview, about, the, events, it, portrays, the, movie, titled, dub, ek, released, in, 2018, is, the, first, film, based, on, the, life, of, alexander, dub, ek, it, is, a, slovak, historical, movie, whose, main, plot, revolves, around, events, related, to, the, warsaw, pact, invasion
