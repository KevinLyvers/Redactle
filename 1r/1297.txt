anti, ottoman, policies, after, years, of, negotiations, charles, v, came, to, an, agreement, with, pope, paul, iii, for, the, organization, of, the, council, of, trent, 1545, the, refusal, of, the, lutheran, schmalkaldic, league, to, recognize, the, council, s, validity, led, to, a, war, won, by, charles, however, henry, ii, of, france, offered, new, support, to, the, lutheran, cause, and, strengthened, the, franco, ottoman, alliance, with, suleiman, the, magnificent, ultimately, charles, v, conceded, the, peace, of, augsburg, and, abandoned, his, multi, national, project, with, abdications, in, 1556, that, divided, his, hereditary, and, imperial, domains, between, the, spanish, habsburgs, headed, by, his, son, philip, ii, of, spain, and, austrian, habsburgs, headed, by, his, brother, ferdinand, in, 1557, charles, retired, to, the, monastery, of, yuste, in, extremadura, and, died, there, a, year, later, charles, of, austria, was, born, on, 24, february, 1500, in, the, prinsenhof, of, ghent, a, flemish, city, of, the, habsburg, netherlands, to, philip, of, austria, and, joanna, of, trast, mara, his, father, philip, nicknamed, philip, the, handsome, was, the, firstborn, son, of, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, archduke, of, austria, and, mary, of, burgundy, heiress, to, the, burgundian, netherlands, charles, s, mother, joanna, was, a, younger, daughter, of, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, isabella, i, of, castile, the, catholic, monarchs, of, spain, from, the, house, of, trast, mara, the, political, marriage, of, philip, and, joanna, was, first, conceived, in, a, letter, sent, by, maximilian, to, ferdinand, to, seal, an, austro, spanish, alliance, established, as, part, of, the, league, of, venice, directed, against, the, kingdom, of, france, during, the, italian, wars, from, the, moment, he, became, king, of, the, romans, in, 1486, charles, s, paternal, grandfather, maximilian, had, carried, a, very, financially, risky, policy, of, maximum, expansionism, relying, mostly, on, the, resources, of, the, austrian, hereditary, lands, even, though, it, is, often, implied, among, others, by, erasmus, of, rotterdam, that, charles, v, and, the, habsburgs, gained, their, vast, empire, through, peaceful, policies, exemplified, by, the, saying, bella, gerant, ali, t, f, lix, austria, n, be, nam, quae, mars, ali, s, dat, tibi, regna, venus, or, let, others, wage, war, but, thou, o, happy, austria, marry, for, those, kingdoms, which, mars, gives, to, others, venus, gives, to, thee, reportedly, spoken, by, mathias, corvinus, maximilian, and, his, descendants, fought, wars, aplenty, maximilian, alone, fought, 27, wars, during, his, four, decades, of, ruling, his, general, strategy, was, to, combine, his, intricate, systems, of, alliance, wars, military, threats, and, offers, of, marriage, to, realize, his, expansionist, ambitions, ultimately, he, succeeded, in, coercing, bohemia, hungary, and, poland, into, acquiescence, in, the, habsburgs, expansionist, plan, the, fact, that, the, marriages, between, the, habsburgs, and, the, trast, maras, originally, conceived, as, a, marital, alliance, against, france, would, bring, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, to, maximilian, s, male, line, however, was, unexpected, the, marriage, contract, between, philip, and, joanna, was, signed, in, 1495, and, celebrations, were, held, in, 1496, philip, was, already, duke, of, burgundy, although, the, duchy, of, burgundy, itself, had, been, lost, to, the, french, crown, given, mary, s, death, in, 1482, and, also, heir, apparent, of, austria, as, honorific, archduke, joanna, in, contrast, was, only, third, in, the, spanish, line, of, succession, preceded, by, her, older, brother, john, prince, of, asturias, and, older, sister, isabella, of, aragon, both, heirs, to, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, john, and, isabella, died, in, 1498, and, the, catholic, monarchs, desired, to, keep, the, spanish, kingdoms, in, iberian, hands, so, they, designated, their, portuguese, grandson, miguel, da, paz, as, heir, presumptive, of, spain, by, naming, him, prince, of, asturias, but, he, died, as, a, baby, in, 1500, charles, s, mother, went, into, labour, at, a, ball, in, february, 1500, he, was, named, in, honour, of, charles, the, bold, of, burgundy, who, had, tried, to, turn, the, burgundian, state, into, a, continuous, territory, when, charles, was, born, a, poet, at, the, court, reported, that, the, people, of, ghent, shouted, austria, and, burgundy, throughout, the, whole, city, for, three, hours, to, celebrate, his, birth, given, the, dynastic, situation, the, newborn, was, originally, heir, apparent, only, of, the, burgundian, low, countries, as, the, honorific, duke, of, luxembourg, and, second, in, line, to, the, austrian, duchies, becoming, known, in, his, early, years, simply, as, charles, of, ghent, he, was, baptised, at, the, church, of, saint, john, by, the, bishop, of, tournai, the, burgundian, nobles, charles, i, de, cro, and, john, iii, of, glymes, were, his, godfathers, and, margaret, of, york, and, margaret, of, austria, respectively, his, step, grandmother, and, aunt, his, godmothers, charles, s, baptism, gifts, were, a, sword, and, a, helmet, objects, of, burgundian, chivalric, tradition, representing, respectively, the, instrument, of, war, and, the, symbol, of, peace, the, death, in, july, 1500, of, the, young, heir, presumptive, miguel, de, paz, to, the, iberian, realms, of, his, maternal, grandparents, meant, baby, charles, s, future, inheritance, potentially, expanded, to, include, castile, aragon, and, the, overseas, possessions, in, the, americas, in, 1501, his, parents, philip, and, joanna, left, charles, in, care, of, philip, s, step, grandmother, margaret, of, york, in, mechelen, and, went, to, spain, the, main, goal, of, their, spanish, mission, was, the, recognition, of, joanna, as, princess, of, asturias, given, prince, miguel, s, death, a, year, earlier, they, succeeded, despite, facing, some, opposition, from, the, castilian, cortes, which, were, reluctant, to, create, the, premises, for, habsburg, succession, in, 1504, when, her, mother, isabella, died, joanna, became, queen, of, castile, charles, only, met, his, father, again, in, 1503, while, his, mother, returned, in, 1504, after, giving, birth, to, ferdinand, in, spain, the, spanish, ambassador, gutierre, g, mez, de, fuensalida, reported, that, philip, often, visited, and, they, had, lots, of, fun, the, couple, s, unhappy, marriage, and, joanna, s, unstable, mental, state, however, created, many, difficulties, making, it, unsafe, for, the, children, to, stay, with, the, parents, philip, was, recognized, king, of, castile, in, 1506, he, died, shortly, after, an, event, that, was, said, to, drive, the, mentally, unstable, joanna, into, complete, insanity, she, was, retired, in, isolation, to, the, royal, palace, of, tordesillas, charles, s, grandfather, ferdinand, took, control, of, all, the, spanish, kingdoms, under, the, pretext, of, protecting, charles, s, rights, which, in, reality, he, wanted, to, elude, ferdinand, s, new, marriage, with, germaine, de, foix, failed, to, produce, a, surviving, trast, mara, heir, to, the, throne, so, charles, remained, the, heir, presumptive, to, the, iberian, realms, with, his, father, dead, and, his, mother, confined, charles, became, duke, of, burgundy, and, was, recognised, as, prince, of, asturias, heir, presumptive, of, castile, and, honorific, archduke, heir, apparent, of, austria, the, burgundian, inheritance, included, the, habsburg, netherlands, which, consisted, of, a, large, number, of, the, lordships, that, formed, the, low, countries, and, covered, modern, day, belgium, netherlands, and, luxembourg, it, excluded, burgundy, proper, annexed, by, france, in, 1477, with, the, exception, of, franche, comt, at, the, death, of, philip, in, 1506, charles, was, recognized, lord, of, the, netherlands, with, the, title, of, charles, ii, of, burgundy, during, his, childhood, and, teen, years, charles, lived, in, mechelen, together, with, his, sisters, mary, eleanor, and, isabella, at, the, court, of, his, aunt, margaret, of, austria, duchess, of, savoy, william, de, cro, later, prime, minister, and, adrian, of, utrecht, later, pope, adrian, vi, served, as, his, tutors, the, culture, and, courtly, life, of, the, low, countries, played, an, important, part, in, the, development, of, charles, s, beliefs, as, a, member, of, the, burgundian, order, of, the, golden, fleece, in, his, infancy, and, later, its, grandmaster, charles, was, educated, to, the, ideals, of, the, medieval, knights, and, the, desire, for, christian, unity, to, fight, the, infidel, the, low, countries, were, very, rich, during, his, reign, both, economically, and, culturally, charles, was, very, attached, to, his, homeland, and, spent, a, large, part, of, his, life, in, brussels, and, various, flemish, cities, the, spanish, inheritance, resulting, from, a, dynastic, union, of, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, included, spain, as, well, as, the, castilian, possessions, in, the, americas, the, spanish, west, indies, and, the, province, of, tierra, firme, and, the, aragonese, kingdoms, of, naples, sicily, and, sardinia, joanna, inherited, these, territories, in, 1516, while, confined, allegedly, because, she, was, mentally, ill, charles, therefore, claimed, the, crowns, for, himself, jure, matris, thus, becoming, co, monarch, with, joanna, with, the, title, of, charles, i, of, castile, and, aragon, or, charles, i, of, spain, castile, and, aragon, together, formed, the, largest, of, charles, s, personal, possessions, and, they, also, provided, a, great, number, of, generals, and, tercios, the, formidable, spanish, infantry, of, the, time, while, joanna, remained, confined, in, tordesillas, until, her, death, plus, ultra, the, rendition, from, french, into, latin, of, charles, s, personal, motto, plus, oultre, further, beyond, later, became, the, national, motto, of, spain, and, features, on, the, country, s, flag, as, part, of, the, spanish, coat, of, arms, since, the, 18th, century, however, at, his, accession, to, the, iberian, thrones, charles, was, viewed, as, a, foreign, prince, two, rebellions, the, revolt, of, the, germanies, and, the, revolt, of, the, comuneros, contested, charles, s, rule, in, the, 1520s, following, these, revolts, charles, placed, spanish, counselors, in, a, position, of, power, and, spent, a, significant, part, of, his, life, in, castile, including, his, final, years, in, a, monastery, indeed, his, son, and, heir, later, philip, ii, of, spain, was, born, and, raised, in, castile, nonetheless, many, spaniards, believed, that, their, resources, largely, consisting, of, flows, of, silver, from, the, americas, were, being, used, to, sustain, imperial, habsburg, policies, that, were, not, in, the, country, s, interest, charles, inherited, the, austrian, hereditary, lands, in, 1519, as, charles, i, of, austria, and, obtained, the, election, as, holy, roman, emperor, against, the, candidacy, of, the, french, king, since, the, imperial, election, he, was, known, as, emperor, charles, v, even, outside, of, germany, the, dynastic, motto, of, the, house, of, habsburg, used, by, charles, was, a, e, i, o, u, austria, est, imperare, orbi, universo, it, is, austria, s, destiny, to, rule, the, world, although, its, exact, meaning, remains, disputed, charles, staunchly, defended, catholicism, as, lutheranism, spread, various, german, princes, broke, with, him, on, religious, grounds, fighting, against, him, charles, s, presence, in, germany, was, often, marked, by, the, organization, of, imperial, diets, to, maintain, religious, and, political, unity, he, was, frequently, in, northern, italy, often, taking, part, in, complicated, negotiations, with, the, popes, to, address, the, rise, of, protestantism, it, is, important, to, note, though, that, the, german, catholics, supported, the, emperor, charles, had, a, close, relationship, with, important, german, families, like, the, house, of, nassau, many, of, which, were, represented, at, his, imperial, court, many, german, princes, noblemen, and, generals, led, his, military, campaigns, against, france, and, the, ottomans, or, accompanied, him, in, his, travels, and, the, bulk, of, his, army, was, generally, composed, of, german, troops, especially, the, imperial, landsknechte, in, 1506, charles, inherited, his, father, s, burgundian, territories, that, included, franche, comt, and, most, notably, the, low, countries, the, latter, territories, mostly, lay, within, the, holy, roman, empire, and, its, borders, but, were, formally, divided, between, fiefs, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, french, fiefs, such, as, charles, s, birthplace, of, flanders, the, last, remnant, of, the, burgundian, state, a, powerful, player, in, the, hundred, years, war, since, he, was, a, minor, his, aunt, margaret, of, austria, acted, as, regent, as, appointed, by, emperor, maximilian, until, 1515, she, soon, found, herself, at, war, with, france, over, charles, s, requirement, to, pay, homage, to, the, french, king, for, flanders, as, his, father, had, done, the, outcome, was, that, france, relinquished, its, ancient, claim, on, flanders, in, 1528, from, 1515, to, 1523, charles, s, government, in, the, netherlands, also, had, to, contend, with, the, rebellion, of, frisian, peasants, led, by, pier, gerlofs, donia, and, wijard, jelckama, the, rebels, were, initially, successful, but, after, a, series, of, defeats, the, remaining, leaders, were, captured, and, executed, in, 1523, charles, extended, the, burgundian, territory, with, the, annexation, of, tournai, artois, utrecht, groningen, and, guelders, the, seventeen, provinces, had, been, unified, by, charles, s, burgundian, ancestors, but, nominally, were, fiefs, of, either, france, or, the, holy, roman, empire, charles, eventually, won, the, guelders, wars, and, united, all, provinces, under, his, rule, the, last, one, being, the, duchy, of, guelders, in, 1549, charles, issued, a, pragmatic, sanction, declaring, the, low, countries, to, be, a, unified, entity, of, which, his, family, would, be, the, heirs, the, low, countries, held, an, essential, place, in, the, empire, for, charles, v, they, were, his, home, the, region, where, he, was, born, and, spent, his, childhood, because, of, trade, and, industry, and, the, wealth, of, the, region, s, cities, the, low, countries, also, represented, a, significant, income, for, the, imperial, treasury, the, burgundian, territories, were, generally, loyal, to, charles, throughout, his, reign, the, important, city, of, ghent, rebelled, in, 1539, due, to, heavy, tax, payments, demanded, by, charles, the, rebellion, did, not, last, long, however, as, charles, s, military, response, with, reinforcement, from, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, 3rd, duke, of, alba, was, swift, and, humiliating, to, the, rebels, of, ghent, in, the, castilian, cortes, of, valladolid, in, 1506, and, of, madrid, in, 1510, charles, was, sworn, as, the, prince, of, asturias, heir, apparent, to, his, mother, queen, joanna, on, the, other, hand, in, 1502, the, aragonese, corts, gathered, in, zaragoza, and, pledged, an, oath, to, joanna, as, heiress, presumptive, but, alonso, de, arag, n, archbishop, of, zaragoza, an, illegitimate, son, of, king, ferdinand, expressed, firmly, that, this, oath, could, not, establish, jurisprudence, that, is, to, say, modify, the, right, of, the, succession, except, by, virtue, of, a, formal, agreement, between, the, corts, and, the, king, so, upon, the, death, of, king, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, on, 23, january, 1516, joanna, inherited, the, crown, of, aragon, which, consisted, of, aragon, majorca, catalonia, valencia, naples, sicily, and, sardinia, while, charles, became, governor, general, nevertheless, the, flemings, wished, charles, to, assume, the, royal, title, and, this, was, supported, by, emperor, maximilian, i, and, pope, leo, x, thus, after, the, commemoration, of, ferdinand, ii, s, obsequies, on, 14, march, 1516, charles, was, proclaimed, king, of, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, jointly, with, his, mother, finally, when, the, castilian, regent, cardinal, jim, nez, de, cisneros, accepted, the, fait, accompli, he, acceded, to, charles, s, desire, to, be, proclaimed, king, and, imposed, his, instatement, throughout, the, kingdom, charles, arrived, in, his, new, kingdoms, in, autumn, of, 1517, jim, nez, de, cisneros, came, to, meet, him, but, fell, ill, along, the, way, not, without, a, suspicion, of, poison, and, he, died, before, reaching, the, king, due, to, the, irregularity, of, charles, assuming, the, royal, title, while, his, mother, the, legitimate, queen, was, alive, the, negotiations, with, the, castilian, cortes, in, valladolid, 1518, proved, difficult, in, the, end, charles, was, accepted, under, the, following, conditions, he, would, learn, to, speak, castilian, he, would, not, appoint, foreigners, he, was, prohibited, from, taking, precious, metals, from, castile, beyond, the, quinto, real, and, he, would, respect, the, rights, of, his, mother, queen, joanna, the, cortes, paid, homage, to, him, in, valladolid, in, february, 1518, after, this, charles, departed, to, the, crown, of, aragon, he, managed, to, overcome, the, resistance, of, the, aragonese, cortes, and, catalan, corts, and, he, was, recognized, as, king, of, aragon, and, count, of, barcelona, jointly, with, his, mother, while, his, mother, was, kept, confined, and, could, only, rule, in, name, the, kingdom, of, navarre, had, been, invaded, by, ferdinand, of, aragon, jointly, with, castile, in, 1512, but, he, pledged, a, formal, oath, to, respect, the, kingdom, on, charles, s, accession, to, the, spanish, thrones, the, parliament, of, navarre, cortes, required, him, to, attend, the, coronation, ceremony, to, become, charles, iv, of, navarre, still, this, demand, fell, on, deaf, ears, and, the, parliament, kept, piling, up, grievances, charles, was, accepted, as, sovereign, even, though, the, spanish, felt, uneasy, with, the, imperial, style, spanish, kingdoms, varied, in, their, traditions, castile, had, become, an, authoritarian, highly, centralized, kingdom, where, the, monarch, s, own, will, easily, overrode, legislative, and, justice, institutions, by, contrast, in, the, crown, of, aragon, and, especially, in, the, pyrenean, kingdom, of, navarre, law, prevailed, and, the, monarchy, was, seen, as, a, contract, with, the, people, this, became, an, inconvenience, and, a, matter, of, dispute, for, charles, v, and, later, kings, since, realm, specific, traditions, limited, their, absolute, power, with, charles, the, government, became, more, absolute, even, though, until, his, mother, died, in, 1555, charles, did, not, hold, absolute, power, in, the, country, soon, resistance, to, the, emperor, arose, because, of, heavy, taxation, to, support, foreign, wars, in, which, castilians, had, little, interest, and, because, charles, tended, to, select, flemings, for, high, offices, in, castile, and, america, ignoring, castilian, candidates, the, resistance, culminated, in, the, revolt, of, the, comuneros, which, charles, suppressed, comuneros, released, joanna, and, wanted, to, depose, charles, and, support, joanna, to, be, the, sole, monarch, instead, while, joanna, refused, to, depose, her, son, her, confinement, would, continue, after, the, revolt, to, prevent, possible, events, alike, immediately, after, crushing, the, castilian, revolt, charles, was, confronted, again, with, the, hot, issue, of, navarre, when, king, henry, ii, attempted, to, reconquer, the, kingdom, main, military, operations, lasted, until, 1524, when, hondarribia, surrendered, to, charles, s, forces, but, frequent, cross, border, clashes, in, the, western, pyrenees, only, stopped, in, 1528, treaties, of, madrid, and, cambrai, after, these, events, navarre, remained, a, matter, of, domestic, and, international, litigation, still, for, a, century, a, french, dynastic, claim, to, the, throne, did, not, end, until, the, july, revolution, in, 1830, charles, wanted, his, son, and, heir, philip, ii, to, marry, the, heiress, of, navarre, jeanne, d, albret, jeanne, was, instead, forced, to, marry, william, duke, of, julich, cleves, berg, but, that, childless, marriage, was, annulled, after, four, years, she, next, married, antoine, de, bourbon, and, both, she, and, their, son, henry, of, navarre, would, oppose, philip, ii, in, the, french, wars, of, religion, after, its, integration, into, charles, s, empire, castile, guaranteed, effective, military, units, and, its, american, possessions, provided, the, bulk, of, the, empire, s, financial, resources, however, the, two, conflicting, strategies, of, charles, v, enhancing, the, possessions, of, his, family, and, protecting, catholicism, against,

threatened, by, the, ottoman, empire, and, barbary, pirates, charles, instead, focused, on, defeating, protestantism, in, germany, and, the, netherlands, which, proved, to, be, lost, causes, each, hastened, the, economic, decline, of, the, spanish, empire, in, the, next, generation, the, enormous, budget, deficit, accumulated, during, charles, s, reign, along, with, the, inflation, that, affected, the, kingdom, resulted, in, declaring, bankruptcy, during, the, reign, of, philip, ii, the, crown, of, aragon, inherited, by, charles, included, the, kingdom, of, naples, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, as, holy, roman, emperor, charles, was, sovereign, in, several, states, of, northern, italy, as, king, of, italy, the, duchy, of, milan, however, was, under, french, control, france, took, milan, from, the, house, of, sforza, after, victory, against, switzerland, at, the, battle, of, marignano, in, 1515, imperial, papal, troops, succeeded, in, re, installing, francesco, ii, sforza, in, milan, in, 1521, in, the, context, of, an, alliance, between, charles, v, and, pope, leo, x, a, franco, swiss, army, was, expelled, from, lombardy, at, the, battle, of, bicocca, 1522, in, 1524, francis, i, of, france, retook, the, initiative, crossing, into, lombardy, where, milan, along, with, several, other, cities, once, again, fell, to, his, attack, pavia, alone, held, out, and, on, 24, february, 1525, charles, s, twenty, fifth, birthday, charles, s, forces, led, by, charles, de, lannoy, captured, francis, and, crushed, his, army, in, the, battle, of, pavia, in, 1535, francesco, ii, sforza, died, without, heirs, and, charles, v, annexed, the, territory, as, a, vacant, imperial, state, with, the, help, of, massimiliano, stampa, one, of, the, most, influential, courtiers, of, the, late, duke, charles, successfully, held, on, to, all, of, its, italian, territories, though, they, were, invaded, again, on, multiple, occasions, during, the, italian, wars, in, addition, habsburg, trade, in, the, mediterranean, was, consistently, disrupted, by, the, ottoman, empire, and, its, vassal, barbary, pirates, in, 1538, a, holy, league, consisting, of, all, the, italian, states, and, the, spanish, kingdoms, was, formed, to, drive, the, ottomans, back, but, it, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, preveza, decisive, naval, victory, eluded, charles, it, would, not, be, achieved, until, after, his, death, at, the, battle, of, lepanto, in, 1571, after, the, death, of, his, paternal, grandfather, maximilian, in, 1519, charles, inherited, the, habsburg, monarchy, he, was, also, the, natural, candidate, of, the, electors, to, succeed, his, grandfather, as, holy, roman, emperor, he, defeated, the, candidacies, of, frederick, iii, of, saxony, francis, i, of, france, and, henry, viii, of, england, in, the, 1519, imperial, election, according, to, some, charles, became, emperor, due, to, the, fact, that, by, paying, huge, bribes, to, the, electors, he, was, the, highest, bidder, he, won, the, crown, on, 28, june, 1519, on, 23, october, 1520, he, was, crowned, in, germany, and, some, ten, years, later, on, 24, february, 1530, he, was, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, by, pope, clement, vii, in, bologna, the, last, emperor, to, receive, a, papal, coronation, others, point, out, that, while, the, electors, were, paid, this, was, not, the, reason, for, the, outcome, or, at, most, played, only, a, small, part, the, important, factor, that, swayed, the, final, decision, was, that, frederick, refused, the, offer, and, made, a, speech, in, support, of, charles, on, the, ground, that, they, needed, a, strong, leader, against, the, ottomans, charles, had, the, resources, and, was, a, prince, of, german, extraction, although, even, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, his, position, was, more, powerful, than, that, of, any, of, his, predecessors, the, decentralized, structure, of, the, empire, proved, resilient, not, least, because, of, the, reformation, it, was, exactly, during, this, crucial, period, charles, v, and, ferdinand, were, too, busy, with, non, german, affairs, to, prevent, imperial, cities, in, upper, germany, from, becoming, estranged, from, imperial, power, due, to, charles, v, s, difficulties, in, coordinating, between, the, austrian, hungarian, fronts, and, his, mediterranean, fronts, in, the, face, of, the, ottoman, threat, as, well, as, in, his, german, burgundian, and, italian, theatres, of, war, against, german, protestant, princes, and, france, the, defense, of, central, europe, as, well, as, many, responsibilities, involving, the, management, of, the, empire, was, subcontracted, to, ferdinand, charles, v, abdicated, as, archduke, of, austria, in, 1522, and, nine, years, after, that, he, had, the, german, princes, elect, ferdinand, as, king, of, the, romans, who, thus, became, his, designated, successor, as, emperor, a, move, that, had, profound, implications, for, state, formation, in, south, eastern, europe, afterwards, ferdinand, managed, to, gain, control, of, bohemia, croatia, and, hungary, with, support, from, local, nobles, and, his, german, vassals, charles, abdicated, as, emperor, in, 1556, in, favour, of, his, brother, ferdinand, however, due, to, lengthy, debate, and, bureaucratic, procedure, the, imperial, diet, did, not, accept, the, abdication, and, thus, make, it, legally, valid, until, 24, february, 1558, up, to, that, date, charles, continued, to, use, the, title, of, emperor, much, of, charles, s, reign, was, taken, up, by, conflicts, with, france, which, found, itself, encircled, by, charles, s, empire, while, it, still, maintained, ambitions, in, italy, in, 1520, charles, visited, england, where, his, aunt, catherine, of, aragon, urged, her, husband, henry, viii, to, ally, himself, with, the, emperor, in, 1508, charles, had, been, nominated, by, henry, vii, to, the, order, of, the, garter, his, garter, stall, plate, survives, in, saint, george, s, chapel, the, first, war, with, charles, s, great, nemesis, francis, i, of, france, began, in, 1521, charles, allied, with, england, and, pope, leo, x, against, the, french, and, the, venetians, and, was, highly, successful, driving, the, french, out, of, milan, and, defeating, and, capturing, francis, at, the, battle, of, pavia, in, 1525, to, gain, his, freedom, francis, ceded, burgundy, to, charles, in, the, treaty, of, madrid, as, well, as, renouncing, his, support, of, henry, ii, s, claim, over, navarre, when, he, was, released, however, francis, had, the, parlement, of, paris, denounce, the, treaty, because, it, had, been, signed, under, duress, france, then, joined, the, league, of, cognac, that, pope, clement, vii, had, formed, with, henry, viii, of, england, the, venetians, the, florentines, and, the, milanese, to, resist, imperial, domination, of, italy, in, the, ensuing, war, charles, s, sack, of, rome, 1527, and, virtual, imprisonment, of, pope, clement, vii, in, 1527, prevented, the, pope, from, annulling, the, marriage, of, henry, viii, of, england, and, charles, s, aunt, catherine, of, aragon, so, henry, eventually, broke, with, rome, thus, leading, to, the, english, reformation, in, other, respects, the, war, was, inconclusive, in, the, treaty, of, cambrai, 1529, called, the, ladies, peace, because, it, was, negotiated, between, charles, s, aunt, and, francis, mother, francis, renounced, his, claims, in, italy, but, retained, control, of, burgundy, a, third, war, erupted, in, 1536, following, the, death, of, francesco, ii, sforza, charles, installed, his, son, philip, in, the, duchy, of, milan, despite, francis, claims, on, it, this, war, too, was, inconclusive, francis, failed, to, conquer, milan, but, he, succeeded, in, conquering, most, of, the, lands, of, charles, s, ally, charles, iii, duke, of, savoy, including, his, capital, turin, a, truce, at, nice, in, 1538, on, the, basis, of, uti, possidetis, ended, the, war, but, lasted, only, a, short, time, war, resumed, in, 1542, with, francis, now, allied, with, ottoman, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, and, charles, once, again, allied, with, henry, viii, despite, the, conquest, of, nice, by, a, franco, ottoman, fleet, the, french, could, not, advance, toward, milan, while, a, joint, anglo, imperial, invasion, of, northern, france, led, by, charles, himself, won, some, successes, but, was, ultimately, abandoned, leading, to, another, peace, and, restoration, of, the, status, quo, ante, bellum, in, 1544, a, final, war, erupted, with, francis, son, and, successor, henry, ii, in, 1551, henry, won, early, success, in, lorraine, where, he, captured, metz, but, french, offensives, in, italy, failed, charles, abdicated, midway, through, this, conflict, leaving, further, conduct, of, the, war, to, his, son, philip, ii, and, his, brother, ferdinand, i, holy, roman, emperor, charles, fought, continually, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, its, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, the, defeat, of, hungary, at, the, battle, of, moh, cs, in, 1526, sent, a, wave, of, terror, over, europe, the, muslim, advance, in, central, europe, was, halted, at, the, siege, of, vienna, 1529, followed, by, a, counter, attack, of, charles, v, across, the, danube, river, however, by, 1541, central, and, southern, hungary, fell, under, ottoman, control, suleiman, won, the, contest, for, mastery, of, the, mediterranean, in, spite, of, christian, victories, such, as, the, conquest, of, tunis, in, 1535, the, regular, ottoman, fleet, came, to, dominate, the, eastern, mediterranean, after, its, victories, at, preveza, in, 1538, and, djerba, in, 1560, shortly, after, charles, s, death, which, severely, decimated, the, spanish, navy, at, the, same, time, the, muslim, barbary, corsairs, acting, under, the, general, authority, and, supervision, of, the, sultan, regularly, devastated, the, spanish, and, italian, coasts, and, crippled, spanish, trade, the, advance, of, the, ottomans, in, the, mediterranean, and, central, europe, chipped, at, the, foundations, of, habsburg, power, and, diminished, imperial, prestige, in, 1536, francis, i, allied, france, with, suleiman, against, charles, while, francis, was, persuaded, to, sign, a, peace, treaty, in, 1538, he, again, allied, himself, with, the, ottomans, in, 1542, in, a, franco, ottoman, alliance, in, 1543, charles, allied, himself, with, henry, viii, and, forced, francis, to, sign, the, truce, of, cr, py, en, laonnois, later, in, 1547, charles, signed, a, humiliating, treaty, with, the, ottomans, to, gain, himself, some, respite, from, the, huge, expenses, of, their, war, charles, v, made, overtures, to, the, safavid, empire, to, open, a, second, front, against, the, ottomans, in, an, attempt, at, creating, a, habsburg, persian, alliance, contacts, were, positive, but, rendered, difficult, by, enormous, distances, in, effect, however, the, safavids, did, enter, in, conflict, with, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, ottoman, safavid, war, forcing, it, to, split, its, military, resources, during, the, 1541, expedition, of, algiers, the, losses, amongst, the, invading, force, were, heavy, with, 150, ships, lost, plus, large, numbers, of, sailors, and, soldiers, a, turkish, chronicler, confirmed, that, the, berber, tribes, massacred, 12, 000, invaders, leaving, war, materiel, including, 100, to, 200, guns, which, would, be, recovered, to, furnish, the, ramparts, of, algiers, charles, army, was, taken, prisoner, in, such, numbers, that, the, markets, of, algiers, were, filled, with, slaves, the, issue, of, the, reformation, was, first, brought, to, the, imperial, attention, under, charles, v, as, holy, roman, emperor, charles, called, martin, luther, to, the, diet, of, worms, in, 1521, promising, him, safe, conduct, if, he, would, appear, after, luther, defended, the, ninety, five, theses, and, his, writings, the, emperor, commented, that, monk, will, never, make, me, a, heretic, charles, v, relied, on, religious, unity, to, govern, his, various, realms, otherwise, unified, only, in, his, person, and, perceived, luther, s, teachings, as, a, disruptive, form, of, heresy, he, outlawed, luther, and, issued, the, edict, of, worms, declaring, you, know, that, i, am, a, descendant, of, the, most, christian, emperors, of, the, great, german, people, of, the, catholic, kings, of, spain, of, the, archdukes, of, austria, and, of, the, dukes, of, burgundy, all, of, these, their, whole, life, long, were, faithful, sons, of, the, roman, church, after, their, deaths, they, left, by, natural, law, and, heritage, these, holy, catholic, rites, for, us, to, live, and, die, by, following, their, example, and, so, until, now, i, have, lived, as, a, true, follower, of, these, our, ancestors, i, am, therefore, resolved, to, maintain, everything, which, these, my, forebears, have, established, to, the, present, charles, v, however, kept, his, word, and, left, martin, luther, free, to, leave, the, city, frederick, iii, elector, of, saxony, and, protector, of, luther, lamented, the, outcome, of, the, diet, on, the, road, back, from, worms, luther, was, kidnapped, by, frederick, s, men, and, hidden, in, a, distant, castle, in, wartburg, there, he, began, to, work, on, his, german, translation, of, the, bible, the, spread, of, lutheranism, led, to, two, major, revolts, that, of, the, knights, in, 1522, 1523, and, that, of, the, peasants, led, by, thomas, muntzer, in, 1524, 1525, while, the, pro, imperial, swabian, league, in, conjunction, with, protestant, princes, afraid, of, social, revolts, restored, order, charles, v, used, the, instrument, of, pardon, to, maintain, peace, following, this, charles, v, took, a, tolerant, approach, and, pursued, a, policy, of, reconciliation, with, the, lutherans, the, 1530, imperial, diet, of, augsburg, was, requested, by, emperor, charles, v, to, decide, on, three, issues, first, the, defence, of, the, empire, against, the, ottoman, threat, second, issues, related, to, policy, currency, and, public, well, being, and, third, disagreements, about, christianity, in, attempt, to, reach, some, compromise, and, a, chance, to, deal, with, the, german, situation, the, diet, was, inaugurated, by, the, emperor, on, 20, june, it, produced, numerous, outcomes, most, notably, the, 1530, declaration, of, the, lutheran, estates, known, as, the, augsburg, confession, confessio, augustana, a, central, document, of, lutheranism, luther, s, assistant, philip, melanchthon, went, even, further, and, presented, it, to, charles, v, the, emperor, strongly, rejected, it, and, in, 1531, the, schmalkaldic, league, was, formed, by, protestant, princes, in, 1532, charles, v, recognized, the, league, and, effectively, suspended, the, edict, of, worms, with, the, standstill, of, nuremberg, the, standstill, required, the, protestants, to, continue, to, take, part, in, the, imperial, wars, against, the, turks, and, the, french, and, postponed, religious, affairs, until, an, ecumenical, council, of, the, catholic, church, was, called, by, the, pope, to, solve, the, issue, due, to, papal, delays, in, organizing, a, general, council, charles, v, decided, to, organize, a, german, summit, and, presided, over, the, colloquy, of, regensburg, between, catholics, and, lutherans, in, 1541, but, no, compromise, was, achieved, in, 1545, the, council, of, trent, was, finally, opened, and, the, counter, reformation, began, the, catholic, initiative, was, supported, by, a, number, of, the, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, however, the, schmalkaldic, league, refused, to, recognize, the, validity, of, the, council, and, occupied, territories, of, catholic, princes, therefore, charles, v, outlawed, the, schmalkaldic, league, and, opened, hostilities, against, it, in, 1546, the, next, year, his, forces, drove, the, league, s, troops, out, of, southern, germany, and, defeated, john, frederick, elector, of, saxony, and, philip, of, hesse, at, the, battle, of, m, hlberg, capturing, both, at, the, augsburg, interim, in, 1548, he, created, a, solution, giving, certain, allowances, to, protestants, until, the, council, of, trent, would, restore, unity, however, members, of, both, sides, resented, the, interim, and, some, actively, opposed, it, the, council, was, re, opened, in, 1550, with, the, participation, of, lutherans, and, charles, v, set, up, the, imperial, court, in, innsbruck, austria, sufficiently, close, to, trent, for, him, to, follow, the, evolution, of, the, debates, in, 1552, protestant, princes, in, alliance, with, henry, ii, of, france, rebelled, again, and, the, second, schmalkaldic, war, began, maurice, of, saxony, instrumental, for, the, imperial, victory, in, the, first, conflict, switched, side, to, the, protestant, cause, and, bypassed, the, imperial, army, by, marching, directly, into, innsbruck, with, the, goal, of, capturing, the, emperor, charles, v, was, forced, to, flee, the, city, during, an, attack, of, gout, and, barely, made, it, alive, to, villach, in, a, state, of, semi, consciousness, carried, in, a, litter, after, failing, to, recapture, metz, from, the, french, charles, v, returned, to, the, low, countries, for, the, last, years, of, his, emperorship, in, 1555, he, instructed, his, brother, ferdinand, to, sign, the, peace, of, augsburg, in, his, name, the, agreements, led, to, the, religious, division, of, germany, between, catholic, and, protestant, princedoms, between, 1554, and, 1556, charles, v, gradually, divided, the, habsburg, empire, and, the, house, of, habsburg, between, a, senior, spanish, line, and, a, german, austrian, branch, his, abdications, all, occurred, at, the, palace, of, coudenberg, in, brussels, first, he, abdicated, the, thrones, of, sicily, and, naples, the, latter, a, papal, fief, and, the, imperial, duchy, of, milan, in, favour, of, his, son, philip, on, 25, july, 1554, philip, was, secretly, invested, with, milan, already, in, 1540, and, again, in, 1546, but, only, in, 1554, did, the, emperor, make, it, public, upon, the, abdications, of, naples, and, sicily, philip, was, invested, by, pope, julius, iii, with, the, kingdom, of, naples, on, 2, october, and, with, the, kingdom, of, sicily, on, 18, november, the, most, famous, and, only, public, abdication, took, place, a, year, later, on, 25, october, 1555, when, charles, announced, to, the, states, general, of, the, netherlands, reunited, in, the, great, hall, where, he, was, emancipated, forty, years, before, by, emperor, maximilian, his, abdication, of, those, territories, in, favour, of, his, son, philip, as, well, as, his, intention, to, step, down, from, all, of, his, positions, and, retire, to, a, monastery, during, the, ceremony, the, gout, afflicted, emperor, charles, v, leaned, on, the, shoulder, of, his, advisor, william, the, silent, and, crying, pronounced, his, resignation, speech, when, i, was, nineteen, i, undertook, to, be, a, candidate, for, the, imperial, crown, not, to, increase, my, possessions, but, rather, to, engage, myself, more, vigorously, in, working, for, the, welfare, of, germany, and, my, other, realms, and, in, the, hopes, of, thereby, bringing, peace, among, the, christian, peoples, and, uniting, their, fighting, forces, for, the, defense, of, the, catholic, faith, against, the, ottomans, i, had, almost, reached, my, goal, when, the, attack, by, the, french, king, and, some, german, princes, called, me, once, more, to, arms, against, my, enemies, i, accomplished, what, i, could, but, success, in, war, lies, in, the, hands, of, god, who, gives, victory, or, takes, it, away, as, he, pleases, i, must, for, my, part, confess, that, i, have, often, misled, myself, either, from, youthful, inexperience, from, the, pride, of, mature, years, or, from, some, other, weakness, of, human, nature, i, nonetheless, declare, to, you, that, i, never, knowingly, or, willingly, acted, unjustly, if, actions, of, this, kind, are, nevertheless, justly, laid, to, my, account, i, formally, assure, you, now, that, i, did, them, unknowingly, and, against, my, own, intention, i, therefore, beg, those, present, today, whom, i, have, offended, in, this, respect, together, with, those, who, are, absent, to, forgive, me, he, concluded, the, speech, by, mentioning, his, voyages, ten, to, the, low, countries, nine, to, germany, seven, to, spain, seven, to, italy, four, to, france, two, to, england, and, two, to, north, africa, his, last, public, words, were, my, life, has, been, one, long, journey, with, no, fanfare, in, 1556, he, finalised, his, abdications, on, 16, january, 1556, he, gave, spain, and, the, spanish, empire, in, the, americas, to, philip, on, 27, august, 1556, he, abdicated, as, holy, roman, emperor, in, favour, of, his, brother, ferdinand, elected, king, of, the, romans, in, 1531, the, succession, was, recognized, by, the, prince, electors, assembled, at, frankfurt, only, in, 1558, and, by, the, pope, only, in, 1559, the, imperial, abdication, also, marked, the, beginning, of, ferdinand, s, legal, and, suo, jure, rule, in, the, austrian, possessions, that, he, governed, in, charles, s, name, since, 1521, 1522, and, were, attached, to, hungary, and, bohemia, since, 1526, according, to, scholars, charles, decided, to, abdicate, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, religious, division, of, germany, sanctioned, in, 1555, the, state, of, spanish, finances, bankrupted, with, inflation, by, the, time, his, reign, ended, the, revival, of, italian, wars, with, attacks, from, henry, ii, of, france, the, never, ending, advance, of, the, ottomans, in, the, mediterranean, and, central, europe, and, his, declining, health, in, particular, attacks, of, gout, such, as, the, one, that, forced, him, to, postpone, an, attempt, to, recapture, the, city, of, metz, where, he, was, later, defeated, in, september, 1556, charles, left, the, low, countries, and, sailed, to, spain, accompanied, by, his, sisters, mary, of, hungary, and, eleanor, of, austria, he,

gout, he, lived, alone, in, a, secluded, monastery, surrounded, by, paintings, by, titian, and, with, clocks, lining, every, wall, which, some, historians, believe, were, symbols, of, his, reign, and, his, lack, of, time, in, august, 1558, charles, was, taken, seriously, ill, with, what, was, revealed, in, the, twenty, first, century, to, be, malaria, he, died, in, the, early, hours, of, the, morning, on, 21, september, 1558, at, the, age, of, 58, holding, in, his, hand, the, cross, that, his, wife, isabella, had, been, holding, when, she, died, following, his, death, there, were, a, plethora, of, commemorations, in, his, empire, including, in, mexico, and, peru, some, 30, 000, masses, were, arranged, for, the, soul, of, the, emperor, and, some, 30, 000, gold, ducats, that, he, had, set, aside, for, the, ransom, of, prisoners, poor, virgins, and, paupers, were, distributed, but, he, owed, huge, debts, from, his, constant, warfare, far, beyond, the, funds, on, hand, which, his, heirs, spent, decades, paying, off, charles, was, originally, buried, in, the, chapel, of, the, monastery, of, yuste, but, he, left, a, codicil, in, his, last, will, and, testament, asking, for, the, establishment, of, a, new, religious, foundation, in, which, he, would, be, reburied, with, isabella, following, his, return, to, spain, in, 1559, their, son, philip, undertook, the, task, of, fulfilling, his, father, s, wish, when, he, founded, the, monastery, of, san, lorenzo, de, el, escorial, after, the, monastery, s, royal, crypt, was, completed, in, 1574, the, bodies, of, charles, and, isabella, were, relocated, and, re, interred, into, a, small, vault, directly, underneath, the, altar, of, the, royal, chapel, in, accordance, with, charles, s, wishes, to, be, buried, half,

the, royal, tombs, were, still, under, construction, in, 1654, after, the, basilica, and, royal, tombs, were, finally, completed, during, the, reign, of, their, great, grandson, philip, iv, the, remains, of, charles, and, isabella, were, moved, into, the, royal, pantheon, of, kings, which, lies, directly, under, the, basilica, on, one, side, of, the, basilica, are, bronze, effigies, of, charles, and, isabella, with, effigies, of, their, daughter, maria, of, austria, and, charles, s, sisters, eleanor, of, austria, and, maria, of, hungary, behind, them, exactly, adjacent, to, them, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, basilica, are, effigies, of, their, son, philip, with, three, of, his, wives, and, their, ill, fated, grandson, carlos, prince, of, asturias, given, the, vast, dominions, of, the, house, of, habsburg, charles, was, often, on, the, road, and, needed, deputies, to, govern, his, realms, for, the, times, he, was, absent, from, his, territories, his, first, governor, of, the, netherlands, was, margaret, of, austria, succeeded, by, his, sister, mary, of, hungary, and, emmanuel, philibert, duke, of, savoy, his, first, regent, of, spain, was, adrian, of, utrecht, succeeded, by, isabella, of, portugal, and, philip, ii, of, spain, for, the, regency, and, governorship, of, the, austrian, hereditary, lands, charles, named, his, brother, ferdinand, archduke, in, the, austrian, lands, under, his, authority, at, the, diet, of, worms, 1521, charles, also, agreed, to, favor, the, election, of, ferdinand, as, king, of, the, romans, in, germany, which, took, place, in, 1531, by, virtue, of, these, agreements, ferdinand, became, holy, roman, emperor, and, obtained, hereditary, rights, over, austria, at, the, abdication, of, charles, in, 1556, charles, de, lannoy, carafa, and, antonio, folc, de, cardona, y, enriquez, were, viceroys, of, the, kingdoms, of, naples, sicily, and, sardinia, respectively, overall, charles, v, travelled, ten, times, to, the, low, countries, nine, to, germany, seven, to, spain, seven, to, italy, four, to, france, two, to, england, and, two, to, north, africa, during, all, his, travels, the, emperor, left, a, documentary, trail, in, almost, every, place, he, went, allowing, historians, to, surmise, that, he, spent, 10, 000, days, in, the, low, countries, 6, 500, days, in, spain, 3, 000, days, in, germany, and, 1, 000, days, in, italy, he, further, spent, 195, days, in, france, 99, in, north, africa, and, 44, days, in, england, for, only, 260, days, his, exact, location, is, unrecorded, all, of, them, being, days, spent, at, sea, travelling, between, his, dominions, as, he, put, it, in, his, last, public, speech, my, life, has, been, one, long, journey, charles, never, traveled, to, his, overseas, possessions, in, the, americas, since, such, a, transatlantic, crossing, to, a, place, not, central, to, his, political, interests, at, the, time, was, unthinkable, the, new, world, was, an, increasingly, important, part, of, the, balance, of, power, but, it, was, completely, subordinate, to, european, considerations, the, spanish, colonial, empire, took, up, relatively, little, of, charles, v, s, time, its, principal, function, was, to, provide, resources, to, support, his, ambitions, on, the, near, side, of, the, atlantic, again, and, again, it, was, bullion, from, the, indies, a, fifth, of, total, revenue, which, either, funded, campaigns, against, the, french, turks, and, german, princes, directly, or, provided, the, security, against, which, the, emperor, could, borrow, the, great, banking, house, of, fugger, in, augsburg, for, example, of, nearly, 2, million, escudos, worth, of, treasury, the, largest, recipient, was, germany, followed, by, the, low, countries, charles, s, travels, throughout, his, reign, also, show, his, priority, quite, clearly, he, visited, italy, on, seven, occasions, france, on, four, and, england, and, africa, on, two, and, spent, six, long, stays, in, spain, itself, but, he, travelled, to, flanders, and, germany, on, no, fewer, than, nineteen, occasions, he, never, visited, the, americas, his, imperial, status, stemmed, from, the, imperium, romanum, not, the, global, sweep, of, his, lands, in, short, the, holy, roman, empire, not, the, emerging, spanish, empire, provided, the, imperial, context, in, which, the, ambitions, of, charles, v, played, out, he, did, however, establish, strong, administrative, structures, to, rule, them, including, the, european, based, council, of, the, indies, in, 1524, and, the, establishment, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, and, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, when, the, aztec, and, inca, civilizations, were, conquered, in, his, name, in, 1534, charles, accepted, a, personal, audience, with, maxixcatzin, a, nobleman, from, tlaxcala, who, demanded, and, received, several, special, privileges, for, his, city, and, its, people, the, tlaxcallans, had, formed, an, alliance, with, spain, and, were, instrumental, in, the, overthrow, of, the, aztecs, and, other, conquests, in, the, americas, charles, decrees, recognized, their, contributions, and, promised, that, tlaxcala, s, autonomy, would, be, preserved, his, treatment, of, the, tlaxcallans, and, other, friendly, native, peoples, as, important, allies, rather, than, conquered, subjects, ensured, strong, support, from, tlaxcala, and, other, allied, native, groups, for, the, next, three, centuries, under, the, organization, and, patronage, of, maximilian, i, southern, germany, had, become, the, leading, arms, industry, region, of, the, 16th, century, rivalled, only, by, northern, italy, with, the, chief, centers, being, nuremberg, augsburg, milan, and, brescia, charles, v, continued, with, the, development, of, mass, production, and, standardization, of, gun, caliber, which, greatly, affected, warfare, the, helmschmied, of, augsburg, and, the, negroli, of, milan, were, among, the, foremost, families, of, armourers, of, the, time, under, charles, v, the, spanish, arms, industry, was, also, significantly, expanded, with, significant, improvements, of, the, muskets, the, landsknechte, originally, recruited, and, organized, by, maximilian, and, georg, von, frundsberg, formed, the, bulk, of, charles, v, s, imperial, army, they, surpassed, the, swiss, mercenaries, in, quality, and, quantity, as, the, best, and, most, easily, available, mercenaries, in, europe, and, were, considered, best, fighting, troops, in, the, first, half, of, the, 16th, century, for, their, brutal, and, ruthless, efficiency, with, a, french, saying, going, a, landsknecht, thrown, out, heaven, couldn, t, get, in, hell, because, he, would, frighten, the, devil, terrence, mcintosh, notes, that, charles, v, like, his, grandfather, relied, heavily, on, german, military, manpower, fearsome, landsknechts, as, well, as, redoubtable, swiss, german, mercenaries, maximilian, invaded, northern, italy, in, 1496, 1508, and, repeatedly, between, 1509, and, 1516, soon, after, the, imperial, election, in, 1519, charles, v, was, waging, war, there, his, overwhelmingly, german, troops, won, the, battle, of, pavia, and, captured, the, french, king, in, 1525, two, years, later, they, sacked, the, city, of, rome, murdering, between, six, and, twelve, thousand, residents, and, pillaging, for, eight, months, his, expansionist, and, aggressive, policy, in, combination, with, the, brutal, behaviours, of, the, landsknechte, which, incidentally, happened, right, at, the, formation, of, the, early, modern, german, nation, would, leave, an, indelible, mark, on, his, neighbours, impression, of, the, german, polity, despite, the, fact, that, in, the, long, term, it, was, in, general, not, belligerent, charles, v, also, favoured, german, heavy, cavalry, although, costly, many, cavalrymen, and, noblemen, fighting, for, charles, v, were, of, burgundian, extraction, often, part, of, the, order, of, the, golden, fleece, italian, condottieri, were, also, recruited, in, spain, inheriting, the, reform, work, of, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, in, 1536, charles, reorganized, his, infantry, and, created, the, first, units, of, the, tercios, later, they, would, become, the, most, formidable, fighting, force, of, the, sixteenth, century, the, original, tercios, were, exclusively, spanish, and, this, situation, remained, until, philip, ii, organized, the, italian, tercios, in, 1584, charles, s, main, sources, of, revenue, were, from, castile, naples, and, the, low, countries, which, yielded, in, total, an, annual, amount, of, around, 2, 8, million, spanish, ducats, in, the, 1520s, and, about, 4, 8, million, spanish, ducats, in, the, 1540s, ferdinand, i, s, annual, revenue, totalled, between, 1, 7, million, and, 1, 9, million, venetian, ducats, 2, 15, 2, 5, million, florin, or, rhine, gulden, their, chief, enemy, the, ottomans, had, a, more, streamlined, and, profitable, system, yielding, in, total, 10, million, gold, ducats, in, 1527, 1528, and, also, did, not, suffer, from, deficit, he, often, had, to, depend, on, loans, from, bankers, he, borrowed, 28, million, ducats, in, total, during, his, reign, of, which, 5, 5, million, ducats, came, from, the, fuggers, and, 4, 2, million, from, the, welsers, of, augsburg, other, creditors, were, from, genoa, antwerp, and, spain, the, habsburg, expansion, and, consolidation, of, rule, was, accompanied, by, remarkable, development, of, communication, diplomatic, and, espionage, systems, in, 1495, emperor, maximilian, and, franz, von, taxis, from, the, thurn, und, taxis, family, developed, the, niederl, ndische, postkurs, a, postal, system, that, connected, the, low, countries, with, innsbruck, the, system, quickly, converged, with, the, european, trade, system, and, an, emerging, market, for, news, spurring, a, pan, europe, communication, revolution, the, system, was, developed, further, by, philip, the, handsome, who, negotiated, new, standards, for, the, systems, with, the, taxis, and, unified, communication, between, germany, the, netherlands, france, and, spain, by, adding, stations, in, granada, toledo, blois, paris, and, lyon, in, 1505, after, his, father, s, death, charles, as, duke, of, burgundy, continued, to, develop, the, system, behringer, notes, that, whereas, the, status, of, private, mail, remains, unclear, in, the, treaty, of, 1506, it, is, obvious, from, the, contract, of, 1516, that, the, taxis, company, had, the, right, to, carry, mail, and, keep, the, profit, as, long, as, it, guaranteed, the, delivery, of, court, mail, at, clearly, defined, speeds, regulated, by, time, sheets, to, be, filled, in, by, the, post, riders, on, the, way, to, their, destination, in, return, imperial, privileges, guaranteed, exemption, from, local, taxes, local, jurisdiction, and, military, service, 21, the, terminology, of, the, early, modern, communications, system, and, the, legal, status, of, its, participants, were, invented, at, these, negotiations, he, confirmed, jannetto, s, son, giovanni, battista, as, postmaster, general, chief, et, maistre, general, de, noz, postes, par, tous, noz, royaumes, pays, et, seigneuries, in, 1520, by, charles, v, s, time, the, holy, roman, empire, had, become, the, centre, of, the, european, communication, s, universe, charles, v, also, inherited, efficient, multinational, diplomatic, networks, from, both, the, trast, mara, and, habsburg, burgundian, dynasties, following, the, example, of, the, papal, curia, in, the, late, fifteenth, century, both, dynasties, also, began, to, employ, permanent, envoys, earlier, than, other, secular, powers, the, habsburg, network, developed, in, parallel, to, their, postal, system, charles, v, combined, the, spanish, and, the, imperial, systems, into, one, his, opponents, chiefly, france, found, a, counterweight, though, by, the, alliance, with, the, ottoman, empire, which, francis, i, admitted, to, be, the, only, force, that, could, prevent, the, habsburgs, from, transforming, european, states, into, a, europe, wide, empire, moreover, charles, v, s, military, might, frightened, other, european, rulers, thus, while, he, was, able, to, make, the, pope, a, reluctant, agent, like, his, grandfather, ferdinand, had, done, no, lasting, alliance, could, be, achieved, after, the, battle, of, pavia, the, european, rulers, united, to, prevent, harsh, terms, from, being, placed, upon, france, in, the, 1530s, in, the, context, of, the, conflict, between, the, habsburg, empire, and, their, greatest, opponent, the, ottomans, an, espionage, network, was, built, by, charles, and, don, alfonso, granai, castriota, the, marquis, of, atripalda, who, conducted, its, operations,

made, serious, progress, in, his, mastery, of, verse, in, the, italian, style, charles, commissioned, several, portraits, from, the, painter, titian, including, the, portrait, of, charles, v, and, the, equestrian, portrait, of, charles, v, becoming, a, friend, of, the, artist, these, portraits, helped, to, spread, the, image, of, charles, as, a, powerful, ruler, and, protector, of, christendom, promoting, his, image, as, an, enlightened, renaissance, ruler, the, building, of, the, palace, of, charles, v, was, commissioned, charles, who, wished, to, establish, his, residence, close, to, the, alhambra, palaces, although, the, catholic, monarchs, had, already, altered, some, rooms, of, the, alhambra, after, the, conquest, of, the, city, in, 1492, charles, v, intended, to, construct, a, permanent, residence, befitting, an, emperor, the, project, was, given, to, pedro, machuca, an, architect, whose, life, and, development, are, poorly, documented, at, the, time, spanish, architecture, was, immersed, in, the, plateresque, style, with, traces, of, gothic, architecture, still, visible, machuca, built, a, palace, corresponding, stylistically, to, mannerism, a, mode, then, in, its,

been, a, home, to, a, monarch, and, stood, roofless, until, 1957, from, his, maternal, grandmother, isabella, i, of, castile, who, had, funded, christopher, columbus, s, first, voyage, in, 1492, charles, inherited, castile, s, overseas, territories, in, the, americas, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, began, in, 1493, but, these, permanent, settlements, in, the, caribbean, and, spanish, main, were, marginal, to, charles, s, european, empire, and, not, the, focus, of, his, attention, through, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, 1494, spain, and, portugal, had, agreed, on, a, division, of, overseas, territories, so, that, with, the, exception, of, brazil, which, portugal, could, claim, charles, could, claim, the, rest, of, the, new, world, the, realm, of, his, known, possessions, expanded, with, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, 1519, 21, under, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, and, by, magellan, s, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, in, 1522, these, successes, convinced, charles, of, his, divine, mission, to, become, the, leader, of, christendom, which, still, perceived, a, significant, threat, from, islam, the, conquest, of, central, mexico, bringing, a, high, indigenous, civilization, under, spanish, rule, compelled, charles, to, grapple, with, creating, structures, of, institutional, rule, in, the, americas, charles, had, begun, creating, councils, to, oversee, aspects, of, his, realms, first, reorganizing, the, existing, council, of, castile, established, by, the, catholic, monarchs, indicating, the, americas, importance, he, founded, the, council, of, the, indies, in, 1524, to, deal, with, the, complexities, of, castile, s, overseas, possessions, unlike, his, european, possessions, that, were, not, consolidated, geographically, but, were, nonetheless, all, relatively, near, each, other, ruling, the, americas, had, to, take, into, account, the, atlantic, ocean, prior, to, the, creation, of, the, viceroyalties, he, established, a, high, court, audiencia, to, administer, justice, he, formalized, conversion, of, indigenous, populations, to, christianity, the, so, called, spiritual, conquest, by, sending, franciscan, dominican, and, augustinian, friars, starting, in, the, mid, 1520s, with, the, discovery, of, large, deposits, of, silver, in, northern, mexico, in, the, 1540s, and, in, 1545, in, peru, at, potos, charles, s, advisors, urged, regulation, of, mining, to, ensure, that, bullion, was, directed, to, crown, coffers, ad, hoc, administrative, solutions, of, the, early, conquest, period, gave, way, to, charles, s, establishment, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, in, mexico, city, 1535, the, spanish, capital, founded, on, the, ruins, of, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, in, the, 1530s, charles, established, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, in, the, newly, founded, spanish, capital, of, lima, 1544, as, it, became, clear, that, establishing, royal, control, was, important, charles, sought, to, undermine, growing, power, of, the, group, of, conquistadors, in, mexico, and, peru, awarded, personal, grants, of, indigenous, labor, in, perpetuity, by, issuing, the, new, laws, of, 1542, ending, grant, holders, rights, in, perpetuity, dominican, friar, bartolom, de, las, casas, s, long, term, campaign, to, protect, indigenous, populations, from, spanish, conquerors, exploitation, influenced, charles, s, new, policy, in, peru, it, resulted, in, a, major, spanish, rebellion, against, the, crown, when, the, newly, appointed, viceroy, blasco, n, ez, vela, attempted, to, implement, the, measure, in, mexico, viceroy, don, antonio, de, mendoza, prudently, did, not, in, peru, the, new, viceroy, was, murdered, to, many, spanish, settlers, the, new, laws, seemed, like, a, declaration, of, war, and, their, hostile, reaction, was, swift, and, overwhelming, the, violent, uprising, necessitated, a, major, military, response, organized, by, pedro, de, la, gasca, to, whom, charles, granted, sweeping, powers, in, order, to, re, establish, royal, authority, the, rebellion, in, peru, coincided, with, one, in, germany, in, the, americas, charles, was, forced, to, temper, the, initial, order, ending, inheritance, allowing, grants, to, be, passed, on, to, one, further, generation, but, he, refused, to, yield, on, the, question, of, allowing, enslavement, of, the, indigenous, regarding, the, spanish, rebels, supporting, the, cause, of, gonzalo, pizarro, who, might, have, set, up, a, kingdom, of, peru, with, himself, as, ruler, charles, fully, supported, pizarro, s, beheading, and, his, supporters, execution, and, confiscation, of, property, this, was, similar, to, the, treatment, of, comunero, rebels, early, in, his, iberian, rule, pizarro, s, execution, marks, the, end, of, spanish, rebellion, against, the, crown, relatively, early, in, his, rule, charles, assigned, a, concession, 1528, in, venezuela, province, to, bartholomeus, v, welser, in, compensation, for, his, inability, to, repay, debts, owed, the, concession, known, as, klein, venedig, little, venice, was, revoked, in, 1546, during, the, rebellion, in, peru, by, spanish, colonists, against, charles, the, question, of, labor, and, treatment, of, indigenous, populations, had, occupied, charles, s, maternal, grandparents, and, as, indigenous, populations, in, the, caribbean, were, decimated, by, disease, and, overwork, transshipment, of, african, slaves, to, replace, the, labor, force, began, on, 28, august, 1518, charles, issued, a, charter, authorizing, the, transportation, of, slaves, directly, from, africa, to, the, americas, up, until, that, point, since, at, least, 1510, african, slaves, had, usually, been, transported, to, castile, or, portugal, and, had, then, been, transshipped, to, the, caribbean, charles, s, decision, to, create, a, direct, more, economically, viable, africa, to, america, slave, trade, fundamentally, changed, the, nature, and, scale, of, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, protection, of, indigenous, populations, against, spaniards, exploitation, was, the, key, motivation, behind, charles, s, issuance, of, the, 1542, new, laws, with, gasca, s, suppression, of, spanish, colonists, rebellion, in, peru, charles, was, still, concerned, about, the, welfare, of, his, indigenous, subjects, so, on, 3, july, 1549, charles, ordered, the, council, of, the, indies, to, stop, all, the, conquests, until, it, was, certain, that, spain, was, acting, in, accordance, with, the, moral, law, so, penetration, into, the, american, continent, was, suspended, until, 1556, this, was, because, philosophical, questions, arose, especially, from, catholic, jurists, and, scholastic, philosophers, about, whether, the, hispanic, monarchy, had, the, moral, right, to, legally, conquer, the, indies, since, the, year, 1542, a, moral, crisis, was, developing, in, the, government, because, of, the, spanish, colonization, in, america, while, the, crown, of, castile, was, overwhelmed, by, the, constant, denunciations, of, abuses, it, was, receiving, especially, from, the, conquests, in, peru, and, those, that, occurred, in, the, new, kingdom, of, granada, which, could, cause, anguish, in, people, of, all, estates, even, if, they, were, prelates, or, knights, of, the, spanish, nobility, thus, charles, influenced, by, the, reflections, of, francisco, de, vitoria, and, the, school, of, salamanca, together, with, the, pressure, of, missionaries, wanted, to, be, sure, that, their, power, was, beyond, reproach, therefore, it, was, ordered, to, stop, all, military, companies, in, the, overseas, domains, until, a, board, of, wise, men, ruled, on, the, fairest, way, to, carry, them, out, seriously, considering, the, total, or, partial, abandonment, of, the, new, world, until, the, imperial, doubt, was, resolved, regarding, how, to, avoid, in, the, future, the, possibility, of, abusive, discoveries, overwhelming, conquests, and, predatory, colonizations, that, were, based, on, the, oppressive, exploitation, of, indigenous, labor, in, 1550, charles, convened, a, conference, at, valladolid, in, order, to, consider, the, morality, of, the, force, used, against, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, new, world, which, included, figures, such, as, bartolom, de, las, casas, from, which, conceptions, of, the, human, rights, of, the, indians, would, arise, according, to, the, thomistic, natural, law, making, the, hispanic, monarchy, a, pioneer, both, in, theory, and, in, practice, on, how, to, approach, respect, for, the, conquered, theologians, and, jurists, from, all, parts, of, the, empire, began, to, arrive, in, the, capital, presenting, themselves, with, the, best, souls, of, spain, such, as, domingo, de, soto, bartolom, carranza, melchor, cano, and, also, pedro, de, la, gasca, peru, s, first, peacemaker, after, civil, wars, between, the, conquerors, of, peru, together, with, the, jurisconsults, of, the, council, of, the, indies, bartolom, de, las, casas, would, defend, that, the, wars, of, conquest, were, unjust, while, juan, gin, s, de, sep, lveda, would, defend, the, opposite, the, court, after, long, debates, voted, and, tied, so, there, was, no, official, sentence, but, there, were, several, binding, reports, in, which, the, purpose, was, to, ensure, that, the, treatment, given, to, the, natives, was, correct, it, was, the, first, time, that, kings, and, philosophers, conceded, that, men, have, fundamental, rights, for, the, mere, fact, of, being, men, ius, gentium, rights, of, the, eternal, law, that, are, prior, to, any, positive, law, written, in, the, treaties, never, before, had, a, european, people, wondered, in, such, depth, where, their, own, rights, of, the, victor, ended, and, where, the, rights, of, the, defeated, begin, finally, spain, did, not, abandon, the, indies, largely, based, on, the, sayings, of, vitoria, after, many, barbarians, have, converted, there, it, would, not, be, convenient, or, lawful, for, the, prince, to, abandon, the, administration, of, those, provinces, therefore, spanish, rule, was, maintained, as, sep, lveda, claimed, but, it, was, recognized, that, the, indians, were, people, with, their, own, rights, as, de, las, casas, paid, for, and, enshrined, in, the, new, laws, together, with, the, papal, bull, sublimis, deus, given, this, there, was, no, longer, talks, about, conquest, but, about, pacification, so, urbanization, was, resumed, with, specific, instructions, to, avoid, harm, to, the, indians, the, regulations, on, how, to, act, in, the, future, in, terms, of, discoveries, and, colonizations, were, the, following, in,

goods, from, the, natives, and, take, them, by, force, except, for, some, of, them, who, wanted, to, go, as, interpreters, no, viceroy, or, governor, would, undertake, new, voyages, of, discovery, on, their, own, neither, by, sea, nor, by, land, in, the, colonizations, parcels, would, be, prohibited, from, the, first, life, indian, slaves, would, be, freed, it, was, forbidden, to, make, them, slaves, in, the, future, a, revision, of, the, repartimientos, de, indios, to, the, audiencias, would, be, ordered, so, that, those, that, some, spaniards, had, in, excess, would, pass, to, the, crown, all, the, indians, that, private, individuals, had, without, legitimate, title, would, be, transferred, to, the, crown, it, would, be, forbidden, to, charge, the, natives, except, where, it, was, inexcusable, moderate, rates, would, be, imposed, on, taxes, and, services, rates, and, tributes, would, be, completely, abolished, in, those, places, where, the, indians, had, been, subjected, to, fierce, exploitation, the, antilles, his, father, s, sister, margaret, was, the, mother, figure, in, his, life, she, was, a, huge, influence, on, charles, a, canny, learned, and, artistic, woman, with, a, court, that, included, artists, bernard, van, orley, and, albrecht, d, rer, and, master, tapestry, maker, pieter, van, aelst, she, taught, her, nephew, above, all, that, a, court, could, be, a, salon, she, saw, to, his, education, securing, as, tutor, adrian, of, utrecht, a, member, of, the, brethren, of, the, common, life, which, advocated, simplicity, and, promoted, a, cult, of, indigence, and, deprivation, the, brethren, had, many, important, members, including, thomas, kempis, adrian, later, became, pope, adrian, vi, a, third, major, influence, in, charles, s, early, life, was, william, de, cro, sieur, de, chi, ves, who, became, his, governor, and, grand, chamberlain, giving, charles, a, chivalrous, education, he, was, tough, taskmaster, and, when, questioned, about, it, he, said, cousin, i, am, the, defender, and, guardian, of, his, youth, i, do, not, want, him, to, be, incapable, because, he, has, not, understood, affairs, nor, been, trained, to, work, charles, spoke, several, languages, he, was, fluent, in, french, and, dutch, his, native, languages, he, later, added, an, acceptable, castilian, spanish, which, he, was, required, to, learn, by, the, castilian, cortes, generales, he, could, also, speak, some, basque, acquired, by, the, influence, of, the, basque, secretaries, serving, in, the, royal, court, he, gained, a, decent, command, of, german, following, the, imperial, election, though, he, never, spoke, it, as, well, as, french, by, 1532, charles, was, proficient, in, portuguese, and, spoke, latin, a, witticism, sometimes, attributed, to, charles, is, i, speak, spanish, latin, depending, on, the, source, to, god, italian, to, women, french, to, men, and, german, to, my, horse, a, variant, of, the, quote, is, attributed, to, him, by, jonathan, swift, in, his, 1726, gulliver, s, travels, but, there, are, no, contemporary, accounts, referencing, the, quotation, which, has, many, other, variants, and, it, is, often, attributed, instead, to, frederick, the, great, charles, suffered, from, an, enlarged, lower, jaw, mandibular, prognathism, a, congenital, deformity, that, became, considerably, worse, in, later, habsburg, generations, giving, rise, to, the, term, habsburg, jaw, this, deformity, may, have, been, caused, by, the, family, s, long, history, of, repeated, intermarriages, between, close, family, members, as, commonly, practiced, in, royal, families, of, that, era, to, maintain, dynastic, control, of, territory, some, advisors, considered, him, physically, weak, and, used, that, as, a, reason, for, him, to, delay, his, marriage, to, mary, tudor, a, diplomat, in, charles, s, court, described, him, as, not, much, of, a, womaniser, and, did, not, have, out, of, wedlock, children, during, his, marriage, he, suffered, from, fainting, spells, which, might, have, been, epilepsy, he, was, seriously, afflicted, with, gout, presumably, caused, by, a, diet, consisting, mainly, of, red, meat, as, he, aged, his, gout, progressed, from, painful, to, crippling, in, his, retirement, he, was, carried, around, the, monastery, of, yuste, in, a, sedan, chair, a, ramp, was, specially, constructed, to, allow, him, easy, access, to, his, rooms, on, 21, december, 1507, charles, was, betrothed, to, 11, year, old, mary, the, daughter, of, king, henry, vii, of, england, and, younger, sister, to, the, future, king, henry, viii, of, england, who, was, to, take, the, throne, in, two, years, however, the, engagement, was, called, off, in, 1513, on, the, advice, of, cardinal, thomas, wolsey, and, mary, was, instead, married, to, king, louis, xii, of, france, in, 1514, after, his, ascension, to, the, spanish, thrones, of, castile, and, aragon, negotiations, for, charles, s, marriage, began, shortly, after, his, arrival, in, castile, with, the, castilian, nobles, expressing, their, wishes, for, him, to, marry, his, first, cousin, isabella, of, portugal, the, daughter, of, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, and, charles, s, aunt, maria, of, aragon, the, nobles, desired, charles, s, marriage, to, a, princess, of, castilian, blood, and, a, marriage, to, isabella, would, have, secured, an, alliance, between, castile, and, portugal, however, the, 18, year, old, king, was, in, no, hurry, to, marry, and, ignored, the, nobles, advice, exploring, other, marriage, options, instead, of, marrying, isabella, he, sent, his, sister, eleanor, to, marry, isabella, s, widowed, father, king, manuel, in, 1518, in, 1521, on, the, advice, of, his, flemish, counsellors, especially, william, de, cro, charles, became, engaged, to, his, other, first, cousin, mary, daughter, of, his, aunt, catherine, of, aragon, and, king, henry, viii, in, order, to, secure, an, alliance, with, england, however, this, engagement, was, very, problematic, because, mary, was, only, six, years, old, at, the, time, sixteen, years, charles, s, junior, which, meant, that, he, would, have, to, wait, for, her, to, be, old, enough, to, marry, by, 1525, charles, could, not, wait, any, longer, to, marry, and, have, legitimate, children, as, heirs, he, had, abandoned, the, idea, of, an, english, alliance, cancelled, his, engagement, to, mary, and, decided, to, marry, isabella, and, form, an, alliance, with, portugal, he, wrote, to, isabella, s, brother, king, john, iii, of, portugal, making, a, double, marriage, contract, charles, would, marry, isabella, and, john, would, marry, charles, s, youngest, sister, catherine, a, marriage, to, isabella, was, more, beneficial, for, charles, as, she, was, closer, to, him, in, age, was, fluent, in, spanish, and, provided, him, with, a, very, handsome, dowry, of, 900, 000, doblas, de, oro, castellanas, would, help, to, solve, the, financial, problems, brought, on, by, the, italian, wars, the, marriage, brought, him, the, additional, titles, as, monarch, of, the, canaries, and, of, the, indies, the, isles, of, mainland, and, the, ocean, sea, marrying, isabella, would, allow, charles, to, have, her, serve, as, regent, in, spain, whenever, he, left, ultimately, this, union, would, result, in, their, son, philip, having, the, strongest, claim, to, the, portuguese, throne, when, the, house, of, aviz, died, out, in, 1580, resulting, in, the, iberian, union, on, 10, march, 1526, charles, and, isabella, met, at, the, alc, zar, of, seville, the, marriage, was, originally, a, political, arrangement, but, on, their, first, meeting, the, couple, fell, deeply, in, love, isabella, captivated, the, emperor, with, her, beauty, and, charm, they, were, married, that, very, same, night, in, a, quiet, ceremony, in, the, hall, of, ambassadors, just, after, midnight, following, their, wedding, charles, and, isabella, spent, a, long, and, happy, honeymoon, at, the, alhambra, in, granada, charles, began, the, construction, of, the, palace, of, charles, v, in, 1527, wishing, to, establish, a, permanent, residence, befitting, an, emperor, and, empress, in, the, alhambra, palaces, however, the, palace, was, not, completed, during, their, lifetimes, and, remained, roofless, until, the, late, 20th, century, despite, the, emperor, s, long, absences, due, to, political, affairs, abroad, the, marriage, was, a, happy, one, as, both, partners, were, always, devoted, and, faithful, to, each, other, the, empress, acted, as, regent, of, spain, during, her, husband, s, absences, and, she, proved, herself, to, be, a, good, politician, and, ruler, thoroughly, impressing, the, emperor, with, many, of, her, political, accomplishments, and, decisions, the, marriage, lasted, for, 13, years, until, isabella, s, death, in, 1539, the, empress, contracted, a, fever, during, the, third, month, of, her, seventh, pregnancy, which, resulted, in, antenatal, complications, that, caused, her, to, miscarry, a, stillborn, son, her, health, further, deteriorated, due, to, an, infection, and, she, died, two, weeks, later, on, 1, may, 1539, aged, 35, charles, was, left, so, grief, stricken, by, his, wife, s, death, that, for, two, months, he, shut, himself, up, in, a, monastery, where, he, prayed, and, mourned, for, her, in, solitude, charles, never, recovered, from, isabella, s, death, dressing, in, black, for, the, rest, of, his, life, to, show, his, eternal, mourning, and, unlike, most, kings, of, the, time, he, never, remarried, in, memory, of, his, wife, the, emperor, commissioned, the, painter, titian, to, paint, several, posthumous, portraits, of, isabella, the, finished, portraits, included, titian, s, portrait, of, isabella, of, portugal, and, la, gloria, charles, kept, these, paintings, with, him, whenever, he, travelled, and, they, were, among, those, that, he, brought, with, him, after, his, retirement, to, the, monastery, of, yuste, in, 1557, in, 1540, charles, paid, tribute, to, isabella, s, memory, when, he, commissioned, the, flemish, composer, thomas, crecquillon, to, compose, new, music, as, a, memorial, to, her, crecquillon, composed, his, missa, mort, m, a, priv, in, memory, of, the, empress, it, expresses, the, emperor, s, grief, and, great, wish, for, a, heavenly, reunion, with, his, beloved, wife, during, his, lifetime, charles, v, had, several, nonmarital, liaisons, including, some, that, produced, children, one, relationship, was, with, his, step, grandmother, germaine, de, foix, which, may, have, produced, a, child, isabel, after, the, death, of, his, wife, charles, seduced, barbara, blomberg, a, teenager, exactly, the, same, age, as, his, son, philip, he, kept, the, relationship, and, the, existence, of, this, out, of, wedlock, son, secret, no, doubt, because, he, felt, ashamed, of, his, affair, with, a, teenager, when, he, was, forty, six, the, child, named, ger, nimo, later, became, known, as, john, of, austria, the, emperor, made, provisions, for, the, child, in, a, secret, codicil, to, his, will, as, with, his, other, out, of, wedlock, children, the, baby, was, taken, from, the, mother, he, met, this, son, once, the, relationship, was, not, revealed, to, his, legitimate, children, in, his, lifetime, but, they, became, aware, of, the, relationship, after, his, death, charles, and, isabella, had, seven, legitimate, children, but, only, three, of, them, survived, to, adulthood, charles, also, had, natural, children, before, he, married, and, after, he, was, widowed, due, to, philip, ii, being, a, grandson, of, manuel, i, of, portugal, through, his, mother, he, was, in, the, line, of, succession, to, the, throne, of, portugal, and, claimed, it, after, his, uncle, s, death, henry, the, cardinal, king, in, 1580, thus, establishing, the, personal, union, between, spain, and, portugal, charles, also, had, six, children, out, of, wedlock, charles, v, styled, himself, as, holy, roman, emperor, after, his, election, according, to, a, papal, dispensation, conferred, to, the, habsburg, family, by, pope, julius, ii, in, 1508, and, confirmed, in, 1519, to, the, prince, electors, by, the, legates, of, pope, leo, x, although, papal, coronation, was, no, longer, necessary, to, confirm, the, imperial, title, charles, v, was, crowned, in, the, city, of, bologna, by, pope, clement, vii, in, the, medieval, fashion, charles, v, accumulated, a, large, number, of, titles, due, to, his, vast, inheritance, of, burgundian, spanish, and, austrian, realms, following, the, pacts, of, worms, 21, april, 1521, and, brussels, 7, february, 1522, he, secretly, gave, the, austrian, lands, to, his, younger, brother, ferdinand, and, elevated, him, to, the, status, of, archduke, nevertheless, according, to, the, agreements, charles, continued, to, style, himself, as, archduke, of, austria, and, maintained, that, ferdinand, acted, as, his, vassal, and, vicar, furthermore, the, pacts, of, 1521, 1522, imposed, restrictions, on, the, governorship, and, regency, of, ferdinand, for, example, all, of, ferdinand, s, letters, to, charles, v, were, signed, your, obedient, brother, and, servant, nonetheless, the, same, agreements, promised, ferdinand, the, designation, as, future, emperor, and, the, transfer, of, hereditary, rights, over, austria, at, the, imperial, succession, following, the, death, of, louis, ii, king, of, hungary, and, bohemia, at, the, battle, of, mohacs, in, 1526, charles, v, favoured, the, election, of, ferdinand, as, king, of, hungary, and, croatia, and, bohemia, despite, this, charles, also, styled, himself, as, king, of, hungary, and, bohemia, and, retained, this, titular, use, in, official, acts, such, as, his, testament, as, in, the, case, of, the, austrian, lands, as, a, consequence, cartographers, and, historians, have, described, those, kingdoms, both, as, realms, of, charles, v, and, as, possessions, of, ferdinand, not, without, confusion, others, such, as, the, venetian, envoys, reported, that, the, states, of, ferdinand, were, all, held, in, common, with, the, emperor, therefore, although, he, had, agreed, on, the, future, division, of, the, dynasty, between, ferdinand, and, philip, ii, of, spain, during, his, own, reign, charles, v, conceived, the, existence, of, a, single, house, of, austria, of, which, he, was, the, sole, head, in, the, abdications, of, 1554, 1556, charles, left, his, personal, possessions, to, philip, ii, and, the, imperial, title, to, ferdinand, the, titles, of, king, of, hungary, croatia, etc, were, also, nominally, left, to, the, spanish, line, in, particular, to, carlos, prince, of, asturias, and, son, of, philip, ii, however, charles, s, imperial, abdication, marked, the, beginning, of, ferdinand, s, suo, jure, rule, in, austria, and, his, other, lands, despite, the, claims, of, philip, and, his, descendants, hungary, and, bohemia, were, left, under, the, nominal, and, substantial, rule, of, ferdinand, and, his, successors, formal, disputes, between, the, two, lines, over, hungary, and, bohemia, were, to, be, solved, with, the, onate, treaty, of, 1617, as, part, of, andreas, palaiologos, will, he, theoretically, inherited, the, title, of, eastern, roman, emperor, from, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, isabella, i, of, castille, therefore, cementing, the, claim, of, the, holy, roman, empire, of, inheriting, the, roman, legacy, since, the, fall, of, constantinople, however, the, byzantine, imperial, title, was, never, formally, hereditary, and, rested, on, possession, of, that, city, which, led, to, imperial, status, being, claimed, by, the, ottoman, sultans, charles, s, full, titulature, went, as, follows,

as, well, as, various, social, movements, and, wider, problems, associated, with, his, reign, historically, seen, as, a, great, ruler, by, some, or, a, tragic, failure, of, a, politician, by, others, he, is, generally, seen, by, modern, historians, as, an, overall, capable, politician, a, brave, and, effective, military, leader, although, his, political, vision, and, financial, management, tend,
