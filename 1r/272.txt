satan, and, god, s, expulsion, of, them, from, the, garden, of, eden, paradise, lost, elevated, milton, s, reputation, as, one, of, history, s, greatest, poets, he, also, served, as, a, civil, servant, for, the, commonwealth, of, england, under, its, council, of, state, and, later, under, oliver, cromwell, milton, achieved, fame, and, recognition, during, his, lifetime, his, celebrated, areopagitica, 1644, written, in, condemnation, of, pre, publication, censorship, is, among, history, s, most, influential, and, impassioned, defences, of, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, the, press, his, desire, for, freedom, extended, beyond, his, philosophy, and, was, reflected, in, his, style, which, included, his, introduction, of, new, words, coined, from, latin, and, ancient, greek, to, the, english, language, he, was, the, first, modern, writer, to, employ, unrhymed, verse, outside, of, the, theatre, or, translations, milton, is, described, as, the, greatest, english, author, by, his, biographer, william, hayley, and, he, remains, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, preeminent, writers, in, the, english, language, though, critical, reception, has, oscillated, in, the, centuries, since, his, death, often, on, account, of, his, republicanism, samuel, johnson, praised, paradise, lost, as, a, poem, which, with, respect, to, design, may, claim, the, first, place, and, with, respect, to, performance, the, second, among, the, productions, of, the, human, mind, though, he, a, tory, described, milton, s, politics, as, those, of, an, acrimonious, and, surly, republican, milton, was, revered, by, poets, such, as, william, blake, william, wordsworth, and, thomas, hardy, phases, of, milton, s, life, parallel, the, major, historical, and, political, divisions, in, stuart, england, at, the, time, in, his, early, years, milton, studied, at, christ, s, college, cambridge, and, then, travelled, wrote, poetry, mostly, for, private, circulation, and, launched, a, career, as, pamphleteer, and, publicist, under, charles, i, s, increasingly, autocratic, rule, and, britain, s, breakdown, into, constitutional, confusion, and, ultimately, civil, war, while, once, considered, dangerously, radical, and, heretical, milton, contributed, to, a, seismic, shift, in, accepted, public, opinions, during, his, life, that, ultimately, elevated, him, to, public, office, in, england, the, restoration, of, 1660, and, his, loss, of, vision, later, deprived, milton, much, of, his, public, platform, but, he, used, the, period, to, develop, many, of, his, major, works, milton, s, views, developed, from, extensive, reading, travel, and, experience, that, began, with, his, days, as, a, student, at, cambridge, in, the, 1620s, and, continued, through, the, english, civil, war, which, started, in, 1642, and, continued, until, 1651, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1674, milton, was, impoverished, and, on, the, margins, of, english, intellectual, life, but, famous, throughout, europe, and, unrepentant, for, political, choices, that, placed, him, at, odds, with, governing, authorities, john, milton, was, born, in, bread, street, london, on, 9, december, 1608, the, son, of, composer, john, milton, and, his, wife, sarah, jeffrey, the, senior, john, milton, 1562, 1647, moved, to, london, around, 1583, after, being, disinherited, by, his, devout, catholic, father, richard, the, ranger, milton, for, embracing, protestantism, in, london, the, senior, john, milton, married, sarah, jeffrey, 1572, 1637, and, found, lasting, financial, success, as, a, scrivener, he, lived, in, and, worked, from, a, house, in, cheapside, at, bread, street, where, the, mermaid, tavern, was, located, the, elder, milton, was, noted, for, his, skill, as, a, composer, of, music, and, this, talent, left, his, son, with, a, lifelong, appreciation, for, music, and, friendships, with, musicians, such, as, henry, lawes, the, prosperity, of, milton, s, father, allowed, his, eldest, son, to, obtain, a, private, tutor, thomas, young, a, scottish, presbyterian, with, an, ma, from, the, university, of, st, andrews, young, s, influence, also, served, as, the, poet, s, introduction, to, religious, radicalism, after, young, s, tutorship, milton, attended, st, paul, s, school, in, london, where, he, began, the, study, of, latin, and, greek, the, classical, languages, left, an, imprint, on, both, his, poetry, and, prose, in, english, he, also, wrote, in, latin, and, italian, milton, s, first, datable, compositions, are, two, psalms, written, at, age, 15, at, long, bennington, one, contemporary, source, is, brief, lives, of, john, aubrey, an, uneven, compilation, including, first, hand, reports, in, the, work, aubrey, quotes, christopher, milton, s, younger, brother, when, he, was, young, he, studied, very, hard, and, sat, up, very, late, commonly, till, twelve, or, one, o, clock, at, night, aubrey, adds, his, complexion, exceeding, faire, he, was, so, faire, that, they, called, him, the, lady, of, christ, s, college, in, 1625, milton, gained, entry, to, christ, s, college, at, the, university, of, cambridge, where, he, graduated, with, a, ba, in, 1629, ranking, fourth, of, 24, honours, graduates, that, year, in, the, university, of, cambridge, preparing, at, that, time, to, become, an, anglican, priest, he, stayed, on, at, cambridge, where, he, received, his, ma, on, 3, july, 1632, milton, may, have, been, rusticated, suspended, in, his, first, year, at, cambridge, for, quarrelling, with, his, tutor, bishop, william, chappell, he, was, certainly, at, home, in, london, in, the, lent, term, 1626, there, he, wrote, elegia, prima, his, first, latin, elegy, to, charles, diodati, a, friend, from, st, paul, s, based, on, remarks, of, john, aubrey, chappell, whipt, milton, this, story, is, now, disputed, though, certainly, milton, disliked, chappell, historian, christopher, hill, notes, that, milton, was, apparently, rusticated, and, that, the, differences, between, chappell, and, milton, may, have, been, either, religious, or, personal, it, is, also, possible, that, like, isaac, newton, four, decades, later, milton, was, sent, home, from, cambridge, because, of, the, plague, which, impacted, cambridge, significantly, in, 1625, at, cambridge, milton, was, on, good, terms, with, edward, king, he, later, dedicated, lycidas, to, him, milton, also, befriended, theologian, roger, williams, tutoring, williams, in, hebrew, in, exchange, for, lessons, in, dutch, despite, developing, a, reputation, for, poetic, skill, and, general, erudition, milton, suffered, from, alienation, among, his, peers, during, his, time, at, cambridge, having, once, watched, his, fellow, students, attempting, comedy, upon, the, college, stage, he, later, observed, they, thought, themselves, gallant, men, and, i, thought, them, fools, milton, also, was, disdainful, of, the, university, curriculum, which, consisted, of, stilted, formal, debates, conducted, in, latin, on, abstruse, topics, his, own, corpus, is, not, devoid, of, humour, notably, his, sixth, prolusion, and, his, epitaphs, on, the, death, of, thomas, hobson, while, at, cambridge, he, wrote, a, number, of, his, well, known, shorter, english, poems, including, on, the, morning, of, christ, s, nativity, epitaph, on, the, admirable, dramaticke, poet, w, shakespeare, his, first, poem, to, appear, in, print, l, allegro, and, il, penseroso, it, appears, in, all, his, writings, that, he, had, the, usual, concomitant, of, great, abilities, a, lofty, and, steady, confidence, in, himself, perhaps, not, without, some, contempt, of, others, for, scarcely, any, man, ever, wrote, so, much, and, praised, so, few, of, his, praise, he, was, very, frugal, as, he, set, its, value, high, and, considered, his, mention, of, a, name, as, a, security, against, the, waste, of, time, and, a, certain, preservative, from, oblivion, samuel, johnson, lives, of, the, most, eminent, english, poets, after, receiving, his, ma, milton, moved, to, hammersmith, his, father, s, new, home, since, the, previous, year, he, also, lived, at, horton, berkshire, from, 1635, and, undertook, six, years, of, self, directed, private, study, hill, argues, that, this, was, not, retreat, into, a, rural, idyll, hammersmith, was, then, a, suburban, village, falling, into, the, orbit, of, london, and, even, horton, was, becoming, deforested, and, suffered, from, the, plague, he, read, both, ancient, and, modern, works, of, theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and, science, in, preparation, for, a, prospective, poetical, career, milton, s, intellectual, development, can, be, charted, via, entries, in, his, commonplace, book, like, a, scrapbook, now, in, the, british, library, as, a, result, of, such, intensive, study, milton, is, considered, to, be, among, the, most, learned, of, all, english, poets, in, addition, to, his, years, of, private, study, milton, had, command, of, latin, greek, hebrew, french, spanish, and, italian, from, his, school, and, undergraduate, days, he, also, added, old, english, to, his, linguistic, repertoire, in, the, 1650s, while, researching, his, history, of, britain, and, probably, acquired, proficiency, in, dutch, soon, after, milton, continued, to, write, poetry, during, this, period, of, study, his, arcades, and, comus, were, both, commissioned, for, masques, composed, for, noble, patrons, connections, of, the, egerton, family, and, performed, in, 1632, and, 1634, respectively, comus, argues, for, the, virtuousness, of, temperance, and, chastity, he, contributed, his, pastoral, elegy, lycidas, to, a, memorial, collection, for, one, of, his, fellow, students, at, cambridge, drafts, of, these, poems, are, preserved, in, milton, s, poetry, notebook, known, as, the, trinity, manuscript, because, it, is, now, kept, at, trinity, college, cambridge, in, may, 1638, accompanied, by, a, manservant, milton, embarked, upon, a, tour, of, france, and, italy, for, 15, months, that, lasted, until, july, or, august, 1639, his, travels, supplemented, his, study, with, new, and, direct, experience, of, artistic, and, religious, traditions, especially, roman, catholicism, he, met, famous, theorists, and, intellectuals, of, the, time, and, was, able, to, display, his, poetic, skills, for, specific, details, of, what, happened, within, milton, s, grand, tour, there, appears, to, be, just, one, primary, source, milton, s, own, defensio, secunda, there, are, other, records, including, some, letters, and, some, references, in, his, other, prose, tracts, but, the, bulk, of, the, information, about, the, tour, comes, from, a, work, that, according, to, barbara, lewalski, was, not, intended, as, autobiography, but, as, rhetoric, designed, to, emphasise, his, sterling, reputation, with, the, learned, of, europe, he, first, went, to, calais, and, then, on, to, paris, riding, horseback, with, a, letter, from, diplomat, henry, wotton, to, ambassador, john, scudamore, through, scudamore, milton, met, hugo, grotius, a, dutch, law, philosopher, playwright, and, poet, milton, left, france, soon, after, this, meeting, he, travelled, south, from, nice, to, genoa, and, then, to, livorno, and, pisa, he, reached, florence, in, july, 1638, while, there, milton, enjoyed, many, of, the, sites, and, structures, of, the, city, his, candour, of, manner, and, erudite, neo, latin, poetry, earned, him, friends, in, florentine, intellectual, circles, and, he, met, the, astronomer, galileo, who, was, under, house, arrest, at, arcetri, as, well, as, others, milton, probably, visited, the, florentine, academy, and, the, accademia, della, crusca, along, with, smaller, academies, in, the, area, including, the, apatisti, and, the, svogliati, in, which, i, have, always, admired, above, all, others, because, of, the, elegance, not, just, of, its, tongue, but, also, of, its, wit, i, lingered, for, about, two, months, there, i, at, once, became, the, friend, of, many, gentlemen, eminent, in, rank, and, learning, whose, private, academies, i, frequented, a, florentine, institution, which, deserves, great, praise, not, only, for, promoting, humane, studies, but, also, for, encouraging, friendly, intercourse, milton, s, account, of, florence, in, defensio, secunda, he, left, florence, in, september, to, continue, to, rome, with, the, connections, from, florence, milton, was, able, to, have, easy, access, to, rome, s, intellectual, society, his, poetic, abilities, impressed, those, like, giovanni, salzilli, who, praised, milton, within, an, epigram, in, late, october, milton, attended, a, dinner, given, by, the, english, college, rome, despite, his, dislike, for, the, society, of, jesus, meeting, english, catholics, who, were, also, guests, theologian, henry, holden, and, the, poet, patrick, cary, he, also, attended, musical, events, including, oratorios, operas, and, melodramas, milton, left, for, naples, toward, the, end, of, november, where, he, stayed, only, for, a, month, because, of, the, spanish, control, during, that, time, he, was, introduced, to, giovanni, battista, manso, patron, to, both, torquato, tasso, and, to, giambattista, marino, originally, milton, wanted, to, leave, naples, in, order, to, travel, to, sicily, and, then, on, to, greece, but, he, returned, to, england, during, the, summer, of, 1639, because, of, what, he, claimed, in, defensio, secunda, were, sad, tidings, of, civil, war, in, england, matters, became, more, complicated, when, milton, received, word, that, his, childhood, friend, diodati, had, died, milton, in, fact, stayed, another, seven, months, on, the, continent, and, spent, time, at, geneva, with, diodati, s, uncle, after, he, returned, to, rome, in, defensio, secunda, milton, proclaimed, that, he, was, warned, against, a, return, to, rome, because, of, his, frankness, about, religion, but, he, stayed, in, the, city, for, two, months, and, was, able, to, experience, carnival, and, meet, lukas, holste, a, vatican, librarian, who, guided, milton, through, its, collection, he, was, introduced, to, cardinal, francesco, barberini, who, invited, milton, to, an, opera, hosted, by, the, cardinal, around, march, milton, travelled, once, again, to, florence, staying, there, for, two, months, attending, further, meetings, of, the, academies, and, spending, time, with, friends, after, leaving, florence, he, travelled, through, lucca, bologna, and, ferrara, before, coming, to, venice, in, venice, milton, was, exposed, to, a, model, of, republicanism, later, important, in, his, political, writings, but, he, soon, found, another, model, when, he, travelled, to, geneva, from, switzerland, milton, travelled, to, paris, and, then, to, calais, before, finally, arriving, back, in, england, in, either, july, or, august, 1639, on, returning, to, england, where, the, bishops, wars, presaged, further, armed, conflict, milton, began, to, write, prose, tracts, against, episcopacy, in, the, service, of, the, puritan, and, parliamentary, cause, milton, s, first, foray, into, polemics, was, of, reformation, touching, church, discipline, in, england, 1641, followed, by, of, prelatical, episcopacy, the, two, defences, of, smectymnuus, a, group, of, presbyterian, divines, named, from, their, initials, the, ty, belonged, to, milton, s, old, tutor, thomas, young, and, the, reason, of, church, government, urged, against, prelaty, he, vigorously, attacked, the, high, church, party, of, the, church, of, england, and, their, leader, william, laud, archbishop, of, canterbury, with, frequent, passages, of, real, eloquence, lighting, up, the, rough, controversial, style, of, the, period, and, deploying, a, wide, knowledge, of, church, history, he, was, supported, by, his, father, s, investments, but, milton, became, a, private, schoolmaster, at, this, time, educating, his, nephews, and, other, children, of, the, well, to, do, this, experience, and, discussions, with, educational, reformer, samuel, hartlib, led, him, to, write, his, short, tract, of, education, in, 1644, urging, a, reform, of, the, national, universities, in, june, 1642, milton, paid, a, visit, to, the, manor, house, at, forest, hill, oxfordshire, and, aged, 34, married, the, 17, year, old, mary, powell, the, marriage, got, off, to, a, poor, start, as, mary, did, not, adapt, to, milton, s, austere, lifestyle, or, get, along, with, his, nephews, milton, found, her, intellectually, unsatisfying, and, disliked, the, royalist, views, she, had, absorbed, from, her, family, it, is, also, speculated, that, she, refused, to, consummate, the, marriage, mary, soon, returned, home, to, her, parents, and, did, not, come, back, until, 1645, partly, because, of, the, outbreak, of, the, civil, war, in, the, meantime, her, desertion, prompted, milton, to, publish, a, series, of, pamphlets, over, the, next, three, years, arguing, for, the, legality, and, morality, of, divorce, beyond, grounds, of, adultery, anna, beer, author, of, a, 2008, biography, of, milton, points, to, a, lack, of, evidence, and, the, dangers, of, cynicism, in, urging, that, it, was, not, necessarily, the, case, that, the, private, life, so, animated, the, public, polemicising, in, 1643, milton, had, a, brush, with, the, authorities, over, these, writings, in, parallel, with, hezekiah, woodward, who, had, more, trouble, it, was, the, hostile, response, accorded, the, divorce, tracts, that, spurred, milton, to, write, areopagitica, a, speech, of, mr, john, milton, for, the, liberty, of, unlicenc, d, printing, to, the, parlament, of, england, his, celebrated, attack, on, pre, printing, censorship, in, areopagitica, milton, aligns, himself, with, the, parliamentary, cause, and, he, also, begins, to, synthesize, the, ideal, of, neo, roman, liberty, with, that, of, christian, liberty, milton, also, courted, another, woman, during, this, time, we, know, nothing, of, her, except, that, her, name, was, davis, and, she, turned, him, down, however, it, was, enough, to, induce, mary, powell, into, returning, to, him, which, she, did, unexpectedly, by, begging, him, to, take, her, back, they, had, two, daughters, in, quick, succession, following, their, reconciliation, with, the, parliamentary, victory, in, the, civil, war, milton, used, his, pen, in, defence, of, the, republican, principles, represented, by, the, commonwealth, the, tenure, of, kings, and, magistrates, 1649, defended, the, right, of, the, people, to, hold, their, rulers, to, account, and, implicitly, sanctioned, the, regicide, milton, s, political, reputation, got, him, appointed, secretary, for, foreign, tongues, by, the, council, of, state, in, march, 1649, his, main, job, description, was, to, compose, the, english, republic, s, foreign, correspondence, in, latin, and, other, languages, but, he, also, was, called, upon, to, produce, propaganda, for, the, regime, and, to, serve, as, a, censor, in, october, 1649, he, published, eikonoklastes, an, explicit, defence, of, the, regicide, in, response, to, the, eikon, basilike, a, phenomenal, best, seller, popularly, attributed, to, charles, i, that, portrayed, the, king, as, an, innocent, christian, martyr, a, month, later, the, exiled, charles, ii, and, his, party, published, the, defence, of, monarchy, defensio, regia, pro, carolo, primo, written, by, leading, humanist, claudius, salmasius, by, january, of, the, following, year, milton, was, ordered, to, write, a, defence, of, the, english, people, by, the, council, of, state, milton, worked, more, slowly, than, usual, given, the, european, audience, and, the, english, republic, s, desire, to, establish, diplomatic, and, cultural, legitimacy, as, he, drew, on, the, learning, marshalled, by, his, years, of, study, to, compose, a, riposte, on, 24, february, 1652, milton, published, his, latin, defence, of, the, english, people, defensio, pro, populo, anglicano, also, known, as, the, first, defence, milton, s, pure, latin, prose, and, evident, learning, exemplified, in, the, first, defence, quickly, made, him, a, european, reputation, and, the, work, ran, to, numerous, editions, he, addressed, his, sonnet, 16, to, the, lord, generall, cromwell, in, may, 1652, beginning, cromwell, our, chief, of, men, although, it, was, not, published, until, 1654, in, 1654, milton, completed, the, second, defence, of, the, english, nation, defensio, secunda, in, response, to, an, anonymous, royalist, tract, regii, sanguinis, clamor, ad, coelum, adversus, parricidas, anglicanos, a, work, that, made, many, personal, attacks, on, milton, the, second, defence, praised, oliver, cromwell, now, lord, protector, while, exhorting, him, to, remain, true, to, the, principles, of, the, revolution, alexander, morus, to, whom, milton, wrongly, attributed, the, clamor, in, fact, by, peter, du, moulin, published, an, attack, on, milton, in, response, to, which, milton, published, the, autobiographical, defensio, pro, se, in, 1655, milton, held, the, appointment, of, secretary, for, foreign, tongues, to, the, commonwealth, council, of, state, until, 1660, although, after, he, had, become, totally, blind, most, of, the, work, was, done, by, his, deputies, georg, rudolph, wecklein, then, philip, meadows, and, from, 1657, by, the, poet, andrew, marvell, by, 1652, milton, had, become, totally, blind, the, cause, of, his, blindness, is, debated, but, bilateral, retinal, detachment, or, glaucoma, are, most, likely, his, blindness, forced, him, to, dictate, his, verse, and, prose, to, amanuenses, who, copied, them, out, for, him, one, of, these, was, andrew, marvell, one, of, his, best, known, sonnets, when, i, consider, how, my, light, is, spent, titled, by, a, later, editor, john, newton, on, his, blindness, is, presumed, to, date, from, this, period, cromwell, s, death, in, 1658, caused, the, english, republic, to, collapse, into, feuding, military, and, political, factions, milton, however, stubbornly, clung, to, the, beliefs, that, had, originally, inspired, him, to, write, for, the, commonwealth, in, 1659, he, published, a, treatise, of, civil, power, attacking, the, concept, of, a, state, dominated, church, the, position, known, as, erastianism, as, well, as, considerations, touching, the, likeliest, means, to, remove, hirelings, denouncing, corrupt, practises, in, church, governance, as, the, republic, disintegrated, milton, wrote, several, proposals, to, retain, a, non, monarchical, government, against, the, wishes, of, parliament, soldiers, and, the, people, upon, the, restoration, in, may, 1660, milton, fearing, for, his, life, went, into, hiding, while, a, warrant, was, issued, for, his, arrest, and, his, writings, were, burnt, he, re, emerged, after, a, general, pardon, was, issued, but, was, nevertheless, arrested, and, briefly, imprisoned, before, influential, friends, intervened, such, as, marvell, now, an, mp, milton, married, for, a, third, and, final, time, on, 24, february, 1663, marrying, elizabeth, betty, minshull, aged, 24, a, native, of, wistaston, cheshire, he, spent, the, remaining, decade, of, his, life, living, quietly, in, london, only, retiring, to, a, cottage, during, the, great, plague, of, london, milton, s, cottage, in, chalfont, st, giles, his, only, extant, home, during, this, period, milton, published, several, minor, prose, works, such, as, the, grammar, textbook, art, of, logic, and, a, history, of, britain, his, only, explicitly, political, tracts, were, the, 1672, of, true, religion, arguing, for, toleration, except, for, catholics, and, a, translation, of, a, polish, tract, advocating, an, elective, monarchy, both, these, works, were, referred, to, in, the, exclusion, debate, the, attempt, to, exclude, the, heir, presumptive, from, the, throne, of, england, james, duke, of, york, because, he, was, roman, catholic, that, debate, preoccupied, politics, in, the, 1670s, and, 1680s, and, precipitated, the, formation, of, the, whig, party, and, the, glorious, revolution, milton, died, on, 8, november, 1674, just, a, month, before, his, 66th, birthday, he, was, buried, in, the, church, of, st, giles, without, cripplegate, fore, street, london, however, sources, differ, as, to, whether, the, cause, of, death, was, consumption, or, gout, according, to, an, early, biographer, his, funeral, was, attended, by, his, learned, and, great,

1652, had, four, children, mary, powell, died, on, 5, may, 1652, from, complications, following, deborah, s, birth, milton, s, daughters, survived, to, adulthood, but, he, always, had, a, strained, relationship, with, them, on, 12, november, 1656, milton, was, married, to, katherine, woodcock, at, st, margaret, s, westminster, she, died, on, 3, february, 1658, less, than, four, months, after, giving, birth, to, her, daughter, katherine, who, also, died, milton, married, for, a, third, time, on, 24, february, 1663, to, elizabeth, mynshull, or, minshull, 1638, 1728, the, niece, of, thomas, mynshull, a, wealthy, apothecary, and, philanthropist, in, manchester, the, marriage, took, place, at, st, mary, aldermary, in, the, city, of, london, despite, a, 31, year, age, gap, the, marriage, seemed, happy, according, to, john, aubrey, and, lasted, more, than, 12, years, until, milton, s, death, a, plaque, on, the, wall, of, mynshull, s, house, in, manchester, describes, elizabeth, as, milton, s, 3rd, and, best, wife, samuel, johnson, however, claims, that, mynshull, was, a, domestic, companion, and, attendant, and, milton, s, nephew, edward, phillips, relates, that, mynshull, oppressed, his, children, in, his, lifetime, and, cheated, them, at, his, death, his, nephews, edward, and, john, phillips, sons, of, milton, s, sister, anne, were, educated, by, milton, and, became, writers, themselves, john, acted, as, a, secretary, and, edward, was, milton, s, first, biographer, milton, s, poetry, was, slow, to, see, the, light, of, day, at, least, under, his, name, his, first, published, poem, was, on, shakespeare, 1630, anonymously, included, in, the, second, folio, edition, of, william, shakespeare, s, plays, in, 1632, an, annotated, copy, of, the, first, folio, has, been, suggested, to, contain, marginal, notes, by, milton, milton, collected, his, work, in, 1645, poems, in, the, midst, of, the, excitement, attending, the, possibility, of, establishing, a, new, english, government, the, anonymous, edition, of, comus, was, published, in, 1637, and, the, publication, of, lycidas, in, 1638, in, justa, edouardo, king, naufrago, was, signed, j, m, otherwise, the, 1645, collection, was, the, only, poetry, of, his, to, see, print, until, paradise, lost, appeared, in, 1667, milton, s, magnum, opus, the, blank, verse, epic, poem, paradise, lost, was, composed, by, the, blind, and, impoverished, milton, from, 1658, to, 1664, first, edition, with, small, but, significant, revisions, published, in, 1674, second, edition, as, a, blind, poet, milton, dictated, his, verse, to, a, series, of, aides, in, his, employ, it, has, been, argued, that, the, poem, reflects, his, personal, despair, at, the, failure, of, the, revolution, yet, affirms, an, ultimate, optimism, in, human, potential, some, literary, critics, have, argued, that, milton, encoded, many, references, to, his, unyielding, support, for, the, good, old, cause, on, 27, april, 1667, milton, sold, the, publication, rights, for, paradise, lost, to, publisher, samuel, simmons, for, 5, equivalent, to, approximately, 770, in, 2015, purchasing, power, with, a, further, 5, to, be, paid, if, and, when, each, print, run, sold, out, of, between, 1, 300, and, 1, 500, copies, the, first, run, was, a, quarto, edition, priced, at, three, shillings, per, copy, about, 23, in, 2015, purchasing, power, equivalent, published, in, august, 1667, and, it, sold, out, in, eighteen, months, milton, followed, up, the, publication, paradise, lost, with, its, sequel, paradise, regained, which, was, published, alongside, the, tragedy, samson, agonistes, in, 1671, both, of, these, works, also, reflect, milton, s, post, restoration, political, situation, just, before, his, death, in, 1674, milton, supervised, a, second, edition, of, paradise, lost, accompanied, by, an, explanation, of, why, the, poem, rhymes, not, and, prefatory, verses, by, andrew, marvell, in, 1673, milton, republished, his, 1645, poems, as, well, as, a, collection, of, his, letters, and, the, latin, prolusions, from, his, cambridge, days, an, unfinished, religious, manifesto, de, doctrina, christiana, probably, written, by, milton, lays, out, many, of, his, heterodox, theological, views, and, was, not, discovered, and, published, until, 1823, milton, s, key, beliefs, were, idiosyncratic, not, those, of, an, identifiable, group, or, faction, and, often, they, go, well, beyond, the, orthodoxy, of, the, time, their, tone, however, stemmed, from, the, puritan, emphasis, on, the, centrality, and, inviolability, of, conscience, he, was, his, own, man, but, he, was, anticipated, by, henry, robinson, in, areopagitica, while, milton, s, beliefs, are, generally, considered, to, be, consistent, with, protestant, christianity, stephen, fallon, argues, that, by, the, late, 1650s, milton, may, have, at, least, toyed, with, the, idea, of, monism, or, animist, materialism, the, notion, that, a, single, material, substance, which, is, animate, self, active, and, free, composes, everything, in, the, universe, from, stones, and, trees, and, bodies, to, minds, souls, angels, and, god, fallon, claims, that, milton, devised, this, position, to, avoid, the, mind, body, dualism, of, plato, and, descartes, as, well, as, the, mechanistic, determinism, of, hobbes, according, to, fallon, milton, s, monism, is, most, notably, reflected, in, paradise, lost, when, he, has, angels, eat, 5, 433, 439, and, apparently, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, 8, 622, 629, and, the, de, doctrina, where, he, denies, the, dual, natures, of, man, and, argues, for, a, theory, of, creation, ex, deo, milton, was, a, passionately, individual, christian, humanist, poet, he, appears, on, the, pages, of, seventeenth, century, english, puritanism, an, age, characterized, as, the, world, turned, upside, down, he, was, a, puritan, and, yet, was, unwilling, to, surrender, conscience, to, party, positions, on, public, policy, thus, milton, s, political, thought, driven, by, competing, convictions, a, reformed, faith, and, a, humanist, spirit, led, to, enigmatic, outcomes, milton, s, apparently, contradictory, stance, on, the, vital, problems, of, his, age, arose, from, religious, contestations, to, the, questions, of, the, divine, rights, of, kings, in, both, the, cases, he, seems, in, control, taking, stock, of, the, situation, arising, from, the, polarization, of, the, english, society, on, religious, and, political, lines, he, fought, with, the, puritans, against, the, cavaliers, i, e, the, king, s, party, and, helped, win, the, day, but, the, very, same, constitutional, and, republican, polity, when, tried, to, curtail, freedom, of, speech, milton, given, his, humanistic, zeal, wrote, areopagitica, some, of, humanity, s, first, scriptures, on, freedom, of, speech, allow, honest, arguments, to, ignore, attacks, it, is, foolish, to, doubt, the, power, of, education, and, leave, others, waiting, letting, it, become, impossible, to, cope, i, have, seen, cases, where, people, can, refuse, to, show, up, and, make, themselves, known, in, public, competitions, areopagitica, was, written, in, response, to, the, licensing, order, in, november, 1644, milton, s, political, thought, may, be, best, categorized, according, to, respective, periods, in, his, life, and, times, the, years, 1641, 42, were, dedicated, to, church, politics, and, the, struggle, against, episcopacy, after, his, divorce, writings, areopagitica, and, a, gap, he, wrote, in, 1649, 54, in, the, aftermath, of, the, execution, of, charles, i, and, in, polemic, justification, of, the, regicide, and, the, existing, parliamentarian, regime, then, in, 1659, 60, he, foresaw, the, restoration, and, wrote, to, head, it, off, milton, s, own, beliefs, were, in, some, cases, unpopular, particularly, his, commitment, to, republicanism, in, coming, centuries, milton, would, be, claimed, as, an, early, apostle, of, liberalism, according, to, james, tully, with, locke, as, with, milton, republican, and, contraction, conceptions, of, political, freedom, join, hands, in, common, opposition, to, the, disengaged, and, passive, subjection, offered, by, absolutists, such, as, hobbes, and, robert, filmer, a, friend, and, ally, in, the, pamphlet, wars, was, marchamont, nedham, austin, woolrych, considers, that, although, they, were, quite, close, there, is, little, real, affinity, beyond, a, broad, republicanism, between, their, approaches, blair, worden, remarks, that, both, milton, and, nedham, with, others, such, as, andrew, marvell, and, james, harrington, would, have, taken, their, problem, with, the, rump, parliament, to, be, not, the, republic, itself, but, the, fact, that, it, was, not, a, proper, republic, woolrych, speaks, of, the, gulf, between, milton, s, vision, of, the, commonwealth, s, future, and, the, reality, in, the, early, version, of, his, history, of, britain, begun, in, 1649, milton, was, already, writing, off, the, members, of, the, long, parliament, as, incorrigible, he, praised, oliver, cromwell, as, the, protectorate, was, set, up, though, subsequently, he, had, major, reservations, when, cromwell, seemed, to, be, backsliding, as, a, revolutionary, after, a, couple, of, years, in, power, milton, moved, closer, to, the, position, of, sir, henry, vane, to, whom, he, wrote, a, sonnet, in, 1652, the, group, of, disaffected, republicans, included, besides, vane, john, bradshaw, john, hutchinson, edmund, ludlow, henry, marten, robert, overton, edward, sexby, and, john, streater, but, not, marvell, who, remained, with, cromwell, s, party, milton, had, already, commended, overton, along, with, edmund, whalley, and, bulstrode, whitelocke, in, defensio, secunda, nigel, smith, writes, that, john, streater, and, the, form, of, republicanism, he, stood, for, was, a, fulfilment, of, milton, s, most, optimistic, ideas, of, free, speech, and, of, public, heroism, as, richard, cromwell, fell, from, power, he, envisaged, a, step, towards, a, freer, republic, or, free, commonwealth, writing, in, the, hope, of, this, outcome, in, early, 1660, milton, had, argued, for, an, awkward, position, in, the, ready, and, easy, way, because, he, wanted, to, invoke, the, good, old, cause, and, gain, the, support, of, the, republicans, but, without, offering, a, democratic, solution, of, any, kind, his, proposal, backed, by, reference, amongst, other, reasons, to, the, oligarchical, dutch, and, venetian, constitutions, was, for, a, council, with, perpetual, membership, this, attitude, cut, right, across, the, grain, of, popular, opinion, of, the, time, which, swung, decisively, behind, the, restoration, of, the, stuart, monarchy, that, took, place, later, in, the, year, milton, an, associate, of, and, advocate, on, behalf, of, the, regicides, was, silenced, on, political, matters, as, charles, ii, returned, john, milton, was, neither, a, clergyman, nor, a, theologian, however, theology, and, particularly, english, calvinism, formed, the, palette, on, which, he, created, his, greatest, thoughts, milton, wrestled, with, the, great, doctrines, of, the, church, amidst, the, theological, crosswinds, of, his, age, the, great, poet, was, undoubtedly, reformed, though, his, grandfather, richard, the, ranger, milton, had, been, roman, catholic, however, milton, s, calvinism, had, to, find, expression, in, a, broad, spirited, humanism, like, many, renaissance, artists, before, him, milton, attempted, to, integrate, christian, theology, with, classical, modes, in, his, early, poems, the, poet, narrator, expresses, a, tension, between, vice, and, virtue, the, latter, invariably, related, to, protestantism, in, comus, milton, may, make, ironic, use, of, the, caroline, court, masque, by, elevating, notions, of, purity, and, virtue, over, the, conventions, of, court, revelry, and, superstition, in, his, later, poems, milton, s, theological, concerns, become, more, explicit, his, use, of, biblical, citation, was, wide, ranging, harris, fletcher, standing, at, the, beginning, of, the, intensification, of, the, study, of, the, use, of, scripture, in, milton, s, work, poetry, and, prose, in, all, languages, milton, mastered, notes, that, typically, milton, clipped, and, adapted, biblical, quotations, to, suit, the, purpose, giving, precise, chapter, and, verse, only, in, texts, for, a, more, specialized, readership, as, for, the, plenitude, of, milton, s, quotations, from, scripture, fletcher, comments, for, this, work, i, have, in, all, actually, collated, about, twenty, five, hundred, of, the, five, to, ten, thousand, direct, biblical, quotations, which, appear, therein, milton, s, customary, english, bible, was, the, authorized, king, james, when, citing, and, writing, in, other, languages, he, usually, employed, the, latin, translation, by, immanuel, tremellius, though, he, was, equipped, to, read, the, bible, in, latin, in, greek, and, in, hebrew, including, the, targumim, or, aramaic, paraphrases, of, the, old, testament, and, the, syriac, version, of, the, new, together, with, the, available, commentaries, of, those, several, versions, milton, embraced, many, heterodox, christian, theological, views, he, has, been, accused, of, rejecting, the, trinity, believing, instead, that, the, son, was, subordinate, to, the, father, a, position, known, as, arianism, and, his, sympathy, or, curiosity, was, probably, engaged, by, socinianism, in, august, 1650, he, licensed, for, publication, by, william, dugard, the, racovian, catechism, based, on, a, non, trinitarian, creed, milton, s, alleged, arianism, like, much, of, his, theology, is, still, subject, of, debate, and, controversy, rufus, wilmot, griswold, argued, that, in, none, of, his, great, works, is, there, a, passage, from, which, it, can, be, inferred, that, he, was, an, arian, and, in, the, very, last, of, his, writings, he, declares, that, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, a, plain, doctrine, in, scripture, in, areopagitica, milton, classified, arians, and, socinians, as, errorists, and, schismatics, alongside, arminians, and, anabaptists, a, source, has, interpreted, him, as, broadly, protestant, if, not, always, easy, to, locate, in, a, more, precise, religious, category, in, 2019, john, rogers, stated, heretics, both, john, milton, and, isaac, newton, were, as, most, scholars, now, agree, arians, in, his, 1641, treatise, of, reformation, milton, expressed, his, dislike, for, catholicism, and, episcopacy, presenting, rome, as, a, modern, babylon, and, bishops, as, egyptian, taskmasters, these, analogies, conform, to, milton, s, puritanical, preference, for, old, testament, imagery, he, knew, at, least, four, commentaries, on, genesis, those, of, john, calvin, paulus, fagius, david, pareus, and, andreus, rivetus, through, the, interregnum, milton, often, presents, england, rescued, from, the, trappings, of, a, worldly, monarchy, as, an, elect, nation, akin, to, the, old, testament, israel, and, shows, its, leader, oliver, cromwell, as, a, latter, day, moses, these, views, were, bound, up, in, protestant, views, of, the, millennium, which, some, sects, such, as, the, fifth, monarchists, predicted, would, arrive, in, england, milton, however, would, later, criticise, the, worldly, millenarian, views, of, these, and, others, and, expressed, orthodox, ideas, on, the, prophecy, of, the, four, empires, the, restoration, of, the, stuart, monarchy, in, 1660, began, a, new, phase, in, milton, s, work, in, paradise, lost, paradise, regained, and, samson, agonistes, milton, mourns, the, end, of, the, godly, commonwealth, the, garden, of, eden, may, allegorically, reflect, milton, s, view, of, england, s, recent, fall, from, grace, while, samson, s, blindness, and, captivity, mirroring, milton, s, own, lost, sight, may, be, a, metaphor, for, england, s, blind, acceptance, of, charles, ii, as, king, illustrated, by, paradise, lost, is, mortalism, the, belief, that, the, soul, lies, dormant, after, the, body, dies, despite, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, milton, did, not, lose, his, personal, faith, samson, shows, how, the, loss, of, national, salvation, did, not, necessarily, preclude, the, salvation, of, the, individual, while, paradise, regained, expresses, milton, s, continuing, belief, in, the, promise, of, christian, salvation, through, jesus, christ, though, he, maintained, his, personal, faith, in, spite, of, the, defeats, suffered, by, his, cause, the, dictionary, of, national, biography, recounted, how, he, had, been, alienated, from, the, church, of, england, by, archbishop, william, laud, and, then, moved, similarly, from, the, dissenters, by, their, denunciation, of, religious, tolerance, in, england, milton, had, come, to, stand, apart, from, all, sects, though, apparently, finding, the, quakers, most, congenial, he, never, went, to, any, religious, services, in, his, later, years, when, a, servant, brought, back, accounts, of, sermons, from, nonconformist, meetings, milton, became, so, sarcastic, that, the, man, at, last, gave, up, his, place, writing, of, the, enigmatic, and, often, conflicting, views, of, milton, in, the, puritan, age, david, daiches, wrote, christian, and, humanist, protestant, patriot, and, heir, of, the, golden, ages, of, greece, and, rome, he, faced, what, appeared, to, him, to, be, the, birth, pangs, of, a, new, and, regenerate, england, with, high, excitement, and, idealistic, optimism, a, fair, theological, summary, may, be, that, john, milton, was, a, puritan, though, his, tendency, to, press, further, for, liberty, of, conscience, sometimes, out, of, conviction, and, often, out, of, mere, intellectual, curiosity, made, the, great, man, at, least, a, vital, if, not, uncomfortable, ally, in, the, broader, puritan, movement, milton, called, in, the, areopagitica, for, the, liberty, to, know, to, utter, and, to, argue, freely, according, to, conscience, above, all, liberties, to, the, conflicting, protestant, denominations, according, to, american, historian, william, hunter, milton, argued, for, disestablishment, as, the, only, effective, way, of, achieving, broad, toleration, rather, than, force, a, man, s, conscience, government, should, recognise, the, persuasive, force, of, the, gospel, milton, wrote, the, doctrine, and, discipline, of, divorce, in, 1643, at, the, beginning, of, the, english, civil, war, in, august, of, that, year, he, presented, his, thoughts, to, the, westminster, assembly, of, divines, which, had, been, created, by, the, long, parliament, to, bring, greater, reform, to, the, church, of, england, the, assembly, convened, on, 1, july, against, the, will, of, king, charles, i, milton, s, thinking, on, divorce, caused, him, considerable, trouble, with, the, authorities, an, orthodox, presbyterian, view, of, the, time, was, that, milton, s, views, on, divorce, constituted, a, one, man, heresy, the, fervently, presbyterian, edwards, had, included, milton, s, divorce, tracts, in, his, list, in, gangraena, of, heretical, publications, that, threatened, the, religious, and, moral, fabric, of, the, nation, milton, responded, by, mocking, him, as, shallow, edwards, in, the, satirical, sonnet, on, the, new, forcers, of, conscience, under, the, long, parliament, usually, dated, to, the, latter, half, of, 1646, even, here, though, his, originality, is, qualified, thomas, gataker, had, already, identified, mutual, solace, as, a, principal, goal, in, marriage, milton, abandoned, his, campaign, to, legitimise, divorce, after, 1645, but, he, expressed, support, for, polygamy, in, the, de, doctrina, christiana, the, theological, treatise, that, provides, the, clearest, evidence, for, his, views, milton, wrote, during, a, period, when, thoughts, about, divorce, were, anything, but, simplistic, rather, there, was, active, debate, among, thinkers, and, intellectuals, at, the, time, however, milton, s, basic, approval, of, divorce, within, strict, parameters, set, by, the, biblical, witness, was, typical, of, many, influential, christian, intellectuals, particularly, the, westminster, divines, milton, addressed, the, assembly, on, the, matter, of, divorce, in, august, 1643, at, a, moment, when, the, assembly, was, beginning, to, form, its, opinion, on, the, matter, in, the, doctrine, and, discipline, of, divorce, milton, argued, that, divorce, was, a, private, matter, not, a, legal, or, ecclesiastical, one, neither, the, assembly, nor, parliament, condemned, milton, or, his, ideas, in, fact, when, the, westminster, assembly, wrote, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, they, allowed, for, divorce, of, marriage, and, divorce, chapter, 24, section, 5, in, cases, of, infidelity, or, abandonment, thus, the, christian, community, at, least, a, majority, within, the, puritan, sub, set, approved, of, milton, s, views, nevertheless, reaction, among, puritans, to, milton, s, views, on, divorce, was, mixed, herbert, palmer, a, member, of, the, westminster, assembly, condemned, milton, in, the, strongest, possible, language, if, any, plead, conscience, for, divorce, for, other, causes, than, christ, and, his, apostles, mention, of, which, a, wicked, booke, is, abroad, and, uncensured, though, deserving, to, be, burnt, whose, author, hath, been, so, impudent, as, to, set, his, name, to, it, and, dedicate, it, to, your, selves, will, you, grant, a, toleration, for, all, this, palmer, expressed, his, disapproval, in, a, sermon, addressed, to, the, westminster, assembly, the, scottish, commissioner, robert, baillie, described, palmer, s, sermon, as, one, of, the, most, scottish, and, free, sermons, that, ever, i, heard, any, where, history, was, particularly, important, for, the, political, class, of, the, period, and, lewalski, considers, that, milton, more, than, most, illustrates, a, remark, of, thomas, hobbes, on, the, weight, placed, at, the, time, on, the, classical, latin, historical, writers, tacitus, livy, sallust, and, cicero, and, their, republican, attitudes, milton, himself, wrote, that, worthy, deeds, are, not, often, destitute, of, worthy, relaters, in, book, ii, of, his, history, of, britain, a, sense, of, history, mattered, greatly, to, him, the, course, of, human, history, the, immediate, impact, of, the, civil, disorders, and, his, own, traumatic, personal, life, are, all, regarded, by, milton, as, typical, of, the, predicament, he, describes, as, the, misery, that, has, bin, since, adam, once, paradise, lost, was, published, milton, s, stature, as, epic, poet, was, immediately, recognised, he, cast, a, formidable, shadow, over, english, poetry, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, he, was, often, judged, equal, or, superior, to, all, other, english, poets, including, shakespeare, very, early, on, though, he, was, championed, by, whigs, and, decried, by, tories, with, the, regicide, edmund, ludlow, he, was, claimed, as, an, early, whig, while, the, high, tory, anglican, minister, luke, milbourne, lumped, milton, in, with, other, agents, of, darkness, such, as, john, knox, george, buchanan, richard, baxter, algernon, sidney, and, john, locke, the, political, ideas, of, milton, locke, sidney, and, james, harrington, strongly, influenced, the, radical, whigs, whose, ideology, in, turn, was, central, to, the, american, revolution, modern, scholars, of, milton, s, life, politics, and, work, are, known, as, miltonists, his, work, is, the, subject, of, a, very, large, amount, of, academic, scholarship, in, 2008, john, milton, passage, a, short, passage, by, bread, street, into, st, mary, le, bow, churchyard, in, london, was, unveiled, john, dryden, an, early, enthusiast, in, 1677, began, the, trend, of, describing, milton, as, the, poet, of, the, sublime, dryden, s, the, state, of, innocence, and, the, fall, of, man, an, opera, 1677, is, evidence, of, an, immediate, cultural, influence, in, 1695, patrick, hume, became, the, first, editor, of, paradise, lost, providing, an, extensive, apparatus, of, annotation, and, commentary, particularly, chasing, down, allusions, in, 1732, the, classical, scholar, richard, bentley, offered, a, corrected, version, of, paradise, lost, bentley, was, considered, presumptuous, and, was, attacked, in, the, following, year, by, zachary, pearce, christopher, ricks, judges, that, as, critic, bentley, was, both, acute, and, wrong, headed, and, incorrigibly, eccentric, william, empson, also, finds, pearce, to, be, more, sympathetic, to, bentley, s, underlying, line, of, thought, than, is, warranted, there, was, an, early, partial, translation, of, paradise, lost, into, german, by, theodore, haak, and, based, on, that, a, standard, verse, translation, by, ernest,

newton, s, edition, of, milton, was, a, culmination, of, the, honour, bestowed, upon, milton, by, early, enlightenment, thinkers, it, may, also, have, been, prompted, by, richard, bentley, s, infamous, edition, described, above, samuel, johnson, wrote, numerous, essays, on, paradise, lost, and, milton, was, included, in, his, lives, of, the, most, eminent, english, poets, 1779, 1781, in,

edmund, spenser, as, milton, s, precursor, and, saw, himself, as, milton, s, poetical, son, in, his, milton, a, poem, in, two, books, blake, uses, milton, as, a, spiritual, guide, and, a, symbol, of, poetic, inspiration, edmund, burke, was, a, theorist, of, the, sublime, and, he, regarded, milton, s, description, of, hell, as, exemplary, of, sublimity, as, an, aesthetic, concept, for, burke, it, was, to, set, alongside, mountain, tops, a, storm, at, sea, and, infinity, in, the, beautiful, and, the, sublime, he, wrote, no, person, seems, better, to, have, understood, the, secret, of, heightening, or, of, setting, terrible, things, if, i, may, use, the, expression, in, their, strongest, light, by, the, force, of, a, judicious, obscurity, than, milton, the, romantic, poets, valued, his, exploration, of, blank, verse, but, for, the, most, part, rejected, his, religiosity, william, wordsworth, began, his, sonnet, london, 1802, with, milton, thou, should, st, be, living, at, this, hour, and, modelled, the, prelude, his, own, blank, verse, epic, on, paradise, lost, john, keats, found, the, yoke, of, milton, s, style, uncongenial, he, exclaimed, that, miltonic, verse, cannot, be, written, but, in, an, artful, or, rather, artist, s, humour, keats, felt, that, paradise, lost, was, a, beautiful, and, grand, curiosity, but, his, own, unfinished, attempt, at, epic, poetry, hyperion, was, unsatisfactory, to, the, author, because, amongst, other, things, it, had, too, many, miltonic, inversions, in, the, madwoman, in, the, attic, sandra, gilbert, and, susan, gubar, note,

eliot, in, particular, the, claim, that, the, study, of, milton, could, be, of, no, help, it, was, only, a, hindrance, by, arguing, as, if, it, were, a, matter, of, deciding, not, to, study, milton, the, problem, rather, was, to, escape, from, an, influence, that, was, so, difficult, to, escape, from, because, it, was, unrecognized, belonging, as, it, did, to, the, climate, of, the, habitual, and, natural, harold, bloom, in, the, anxiety, of, influence, wrote, that, milton, is, the, central, problem, in, any, theory, and, history, of, poetic, influence, in, english, milton, s,

also, derived, from, milton, s, writings, examples, include, thomas, wolfe, s, look, homeward, angel, aldous, huxley, s, eyeless, in, gaza, arthur, koestler, s, darkness, at, noon, and, william, golding, s, darkness, visible, t, s, eliot, believed, that, of, no, other, poet, is, it, so, difficult, to, consider, the, poetry, simply, as, poetry, without, our, theological, and, political, dispositions, making, unlawful, entry, milton, s, use, of, blank, verse, in, addition, to, his, stylistic, innovations, such, as, grandiloquence, of, voice, and, vision, peculiar, diction, and, phraseology, influenced, later, poets, at, the, time, poetic, blank, verse, was, considered, distinct, from, its, use, in, verse, drama, and, paradise, lost, was, taken, as, a, unique, exemplar, said, isaac, watts, in, 1734, mr, milton, is, esteemed, the, parent, and, author, of, blank, verse, among, us, miltonic, verse, might, be, synonymous, for, a, century, with, blank, verse, as, poetry, a, new, poetic, terrain, independent, from, both, the, drama, and, the, heroic, couplet, lack, of, rhyme, was, sometimes, taken, as, milton, s, defining, innovation, he, himself, considered, the, rhymeless, quality, of, paradise, lost, to, be, an, extension, of, his, own, personal, liberty, this, neglect, then, of, rhime, is, to, be, esteem, d, an, example, set, the, first, in, english, of, ancient, liberty, recover, d, to, heroic, poem, from, the, troublesom, and, modern, bondage, of, rimeing, this, pursuit, of, freedom, was, largely, a, reaction, against, conservative, values, entrenched, within, the, rigid, heroic, couplet, within, a, dominant, culture, that, stressed, elegance, and, finish, he, granted, primacy, to, freedom, breadth, and, imaginative, suggestiveness, eventually, developed, into, the, romantic, vision, of, sublime, terror, reaction, to, milton, s, poetic, worldview, included, grudgingly, acknowledgement, of, the, poet, s, resemblance, to, classical, writers, greek, and, roman, poetry, being, unrhymed, blank, verse, came, to, be, a, recognised, medium, for, religious, works, and, for, translations, of, the, classics, unrhymed, lyrics, like, collins, ode, to, evening, in, the, meter, of, milton, s, translation, of, horace, s, ode, to, pyrrha, were, not, uncommon, after, 1740, a, second, aspect, of, milton, s, blank, verse, was, the, use, of, unconventional, rhythm, his, blank, verse, paragraph, and, his, audacious, and, victorious, attempt, to, combine, blank, and, rhymed, verse, with, paragraphic, effect, in, lycidas, lay, down, indestructible, models, and, patterns, of, english, verse, rhythm, as, distinguished, from, the, narrower, and, more, strait, laced, forms, of, english, metre, before, milton, the, sense, of, regular, rhythm, had, been, knocked, into, the, english, head, so, securely, that, it, was, part, of, their, nature, the, heroick, measure, according, to, samuel, johnson, is, pure, when, the, accent, rests, upon, every, second, syllable, through, the, whole, line, the, repetition, of, this, sound, or, percussion, at, equal, times, is, the, most, complete, harmony, of, which, a, single, verse, is, capable, caesural, pauses, most, agreed, were, best, placed, at, the, middle, and, the, end, of, the, line, in, order, to, support, this, symmetry, lines, were, most, often, octo, or, deca, syllabic, with, no, enjambed, endings, to, this, schema, milton, introduced, modifications, which, included, hypermetrical, syllables, trisyllabic, feet, inversion, or, slighting, of, stresses, and, the, shifting, of, pauses, to, all, parts, of, the, line, milton, deemed, these, features, to, be, reflective, of, the, transcendental, union, of, order, and, freedom, admirers, remained, hesitant, to, adopt, such, departures, from, traditional, metrical, schemes, the, english, had, been, writing, separate, lines, for, so, long, that, they, could, not, rid, themselves, of, the, habit, isaac, watts, preferred, his, lines, distinct, from, each, other, as, did, oliver, goldsmith, henry, pemberton, and, scott, of, amwell, whose, general, opinion, it, was, that, milton, s, frequent, omission, of, the, initial, unaccented, foot, was, displeasing, to, a, nice, ear, it, was, not, until, the, late, 18th, century, that, poets, beginning, with, gray, began, to, appreciate, the, composition, of, milton, s, harmony, how, he, loved, to, vary, his, pauses, his, measures, and, his, feet, which, gives, that, enchanting, air, of, freedom, and, wilderness, to, his, versification, by, the, 20th, century, american, poet, and, critic, john, hollander, would, go, so, far, as, to, say, that, milton, was, able, by, plying, that, most, remarkable, instrument, of, english, meter, to, invent, a, new, mode, of, image, making, in, english, poetry, milton, s, pursuit, of, liberty, extended, into, his, vocabulary, as, well, it, included, many, latinate, neologisms, as, well, as, obsolete, words, already, dropped, from, popular, usage, so, completely, that, their, meanings, were, no, longer, understood, in, 1740, francis, peck, identified, some, examples, of, milton, s, old, words, now, popular, the, miltonian, dialect, as, it, was, called, was, emulated, by, later, poets, pope, used, the, diction, of, paradise, lost, in, his, homer, translation, while, the, lyric, poetry, of, gray, and, collins, was, frequently, criticised, for, their, use, of, obsolete, words, out, of, spenser, and, milton, the, language, of, thomson, s, finest, poems, e, g, the, seasons, the, castle, of, indolence, was, self, consciously, modelled, after, the, miltonian, dialect, with, the, same, tone, and, sensibilities, as, paradise, lost, following, to, milton, english, poetry, from, pope, to, john, keats, exhibited, a, steadily, increasing, attention, to, the, connotative, the, imaginative, and, poetic, value, of, words, milton, s, ode, at, a, solemn, musick, was, set, for, choir, and, orchestra, as, blest, pair, of, sirens, by, hubert, parry, 1848, 1918, and, milton, s, poem, on, the, morning, of, christ, s, nativity, was, set, as, a, large, scale, choral, work, by, cyril, rootham, 1875, 1938, milton, also, wrote, the, hymn, let, us, with, a, gladsome, mind, a, versification, of, psalm, 136, his, l, allegro, and, il, penseroso, with, additional, material, were, magnificently, set, by, handel, 1740
