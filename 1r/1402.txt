long, viewed, phnom, penh, s, population, with, mistrust, particularly, as, the, city, s, numbers, had, been, swelled, by, peasant, refugees, who, had, fled, the, khmer, rouge, s, advance, and, were, considered, to, be, traitors, shortly, after, taking, the, city, the, khmer, rouge, announced, that, its, inhabitants, had, to, evacuate, to, escape, a, forthcoming, us, bombing, raid, the, group,

hard, work, and, loving, cambodia, being, widely, employed, for, instance, broadcast, via, loudspeakers, or, on, the, radio, neologisms, were, introduced, and, everyday, vocabulary, was, altered, to, encourage, a, more, collectivist, mentality, cambodians, were, encouraged, to, talk, about, themselves, in, the, plural, we, rather, than, the, singular, i, while, working, in, the, fields, people,

the, newspaper, padevat, revolution, restrictions, were, placed, on, movement, with, people, permitted, to, travel, only, with, the, permission, of, the, local, khmer, rouge, authorities, in, january, 1976, a, cabinet, meeting, was, held, to, promulgate, a, new, constitution, declaring, that, the, country, was, to, be, renamed, democratic, kampuchea, the, constitution, asserted, state, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, declared, the, equality, of, men, and, women, and, the, rights, and, obligation, of, all, citizens, to, work, it, outlined, that, the, country, would, be, governed, by, a, three, person, presidium, and, at, the, time, pol, pot, and, khmer, rouge, leaders, expected, that, sihanouk, would, take, one, of, these, roles, sihanouk, was, nevertheless, increasingly, uncomfortable, with, the, new, government, and, in, march, he, resigned, his, role, as, head, of, state, pol, pot, tried, repeatedly, but, unsuccessfully, to, get, him, to, change, his, mind, sihanouk, asked, to, be, allowed, to, travel, to, china, citing, the, need, for, medical, treatment, but, this, was, denied, he, was, instead, kept, in, his, palace, which, was, sufficiently, stocked, with, goods, to, allow, him, a, luxurious, lifestyle, throughout, the, khmer, rouge, years, the, removal, of, sihanouk, ended, the, pretence, that, the, khmer, rouge, government, was, a, united, front, with, sihanouk, no, longer, part, of, the, government, pol, pot, s, government, stated, that, the, national, revolution, was, over, and, that, the, socialist, revolution, could, begin, allowing, the, country, to, move, towards, pure, communism, as, swiftly, as, possible, pol, pot, described, the, new, state, as, a, precious, model, for, humanity, with, a, revolutionary, spirit, that, outstripped, that, of, earlier, revolutionary, socialist, movements, in, the, 1970s, world, communism, was, at, its, strongest, point, in, history, and, pol, pot, presented, the, cambodian, example, as, the, one, which, other, revolutionary, movements, should, follow, as, part, of, the, new, presidium, pol, pot, became, the, country, s, prime, minister, it, was, at, this, point, that, he, took, on, the, public, pseudonym, of, pol, pot, as, no, one, in, the, country, knew, who, this, was, a, fictitious, biography, was, presented, pol, pot, s, key, allies, took, the, other, two, positions, with, nuon, chea, as, president, of, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, assembly, and, khieu, samphan, as, the, head, of, state, in, principle, the, khmer, rouge, standing, committee, made, decisions, on, the, basis, of, the, principle, of, democratic, centralism, in, reality, it, was, more, autocratic, with, pol, pot, s, decisions, being, implemented, the, parliament, which, had, been, elected, the, previous, year, never, met, after, 1976, in, september, 1976, pol, pot, publicly, revealed, that, the, angkar, or, organization, as, the, secretive, body, exercising, supreme, power, was, known, was, a, marxist, leninist, organisation, in, september, 1977, at, a, rally, in, the, olympic, stadium, pol, pot, then, revealed, that, angkar, was, a, pseudonym, for, the, cpk, in, september, 1976, it, was, announced, that, pol, pot, had, stepped, down, as, prime, minister, to, be, replaced, by, nuon, chea, but, in, reality, he, remained, in, power, returning, to, his, former, position, in, october, this, was, possibly, a, diversionary, tactic, to, distract, the, vietnamese, government, while, pol, pot, purged, the, cpk, of, individuals, he, suspected, of, harbouring, vietnamese, sympathies, despite, their, marxist, pretences, the, khmer, rouge, sought, to, eradicate, the, working, class, seeing, it, as, a, decadent, relic, of, the, past, the, khmer,

dam, was, built, many, of, these, irrigation, projects, failed, due, to, a, lack, of, technical, expertise, on, the, part, of, the, workers, the, standing, committee, agreed, to, link, several, villages, in, a, single, co, operative, of, 500, to, 1000, families, with, the, goal, of, later, forming, commune, sized, units, twice, that, size, communal, kitchens, were, also, introduced, so, that, all, members, of, a, commune, ate, together, rather, than, in, their, individual, homes, foraging, or, hunting, for, additional, food, was, prohibited, regarded, as, individualistic, behaviour, from, the, summer, of, 1976, the, government, ordered, that, children, over, the, age, of, seven, would, live, not, with, their, parents, but, communally, with, khmer, rouge, instructors, the, co, operatives, produced, less, food, than, the, government, believed, in, part, due, to, a, lack, of, motivation, among, laborers, and, the, diversion, of, the, strongest, workers, to, irrigation, projects, fearing, criticism, many, party, cadres, falsely, claimed, that, they, had, met, the, government, s, food, production, quota, the, government, became, aware, of, this, and, by, the, end, of, 1976, pol, pot, acknowledged, food, shortages, in, three, quarters, of, the, country, members, of, the, khmer, rouge, received, special, privileges, not, enjoyed, by, the, rest, of, the, population,

placed, under, the, responsibility, of, the, defence, minister, son, sen, the, numbers, sent, to, s, 21, grew, steadily, as, the, cpk, purge, proceeded, in, the, first, half, of, 1976, about, 400, people, were, sent, there, in, the, second, half, of, the, year, that, number, was, nearer, to, 1, 000, by, the, spring, of, 1977, 1, 000, people, were, being, sent, there, each, month, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, people, would, be, killed, at, s, 21, during, the, khmer, rouge, period, about, a, dozen, of, them, were, westerners, pol, pot, never, personally, visited, s, 21, from, late, 1976, onward, and, especially, in, the, middle, of, 1977, the, levels, of, violence, increased, across, democratic, kampuchea, particularly, at, the, village, level, in, rural, areas, most, of, the, killings, were, perpetrated, by, young, cadres, who, were, enforcing, what, they, believed, to, be, the, government, s, will, across, the, country, peasant, cadres, tortured, and, killed, members, of, their, communities, whom, they, disliked, many, cadres, ate, the, livers, of, their, victims, and, tore, unborn, foetuses, from, their, mothers, for, use, as, koan, kroach, talismans, the, cpk, central, command, was, aware, of, such, practices, but, did, nothing, to, stop, them, by, 1977, the, growing, violence, coupled, with, poor, food, was, generating, disillusionment, even, within, the, khmer, rouge, s, core, support, base, growing, numbers, of, cambodians, attempted, to, flee, into, thailand, and, vietnam, in, the, autumn, of, 1977, pol, pot, declared, the, purges, at, an, end, according, to, the, cpk, s, own, figures, by, august, 1977, between, 4, 000, and, 5, 000, party, members, had, been, liquidated, as, enemy, agents, or, bad, elements, in, 1978, the, government, initiated, a, second, purge, during, which, tens, of, thousands, of, cambodians, were, accused, of, being, vietnamese, sympathisers, and, killed, at, this, point, the, remaining, cpk, members, who, had, spent, time, in, hanoi, were, killed, along, with, their, children, in, january, 1978, pol, pot, announced, to, his, colleagues, that, their, slogan, should, be, purify, the, party, purify, the,

rouge, spurned, both, the, western, states, and, the, soviet, union, as, sources, of, support, instead, china, became, cambodia, s, main, international, partner, with, vietnam, increasingly, siding, with, the, soviet, union, over, china, the, chinese, saw, pol, pot, s, government, as, a, bulwark, against, vietnamese, influence, in, indochina, mao, pledged, 1, billion, in, military, and, economic, aid, to, cambodia, including, an, immediate, 20, million, grant, many, thousands, of, chinese, military, advisors, and, technicians, were, also, sent, to, the, country, to, assist, in, projects, like, the, construction, of, the, kampong, chhnang, military, airport, the, relationship, between, the, chinese, and, cambodian, governments, was, nevertheless, marred, by, mutual, suspicion, and, china, had, little, influence, on, pol, pot, s, domestic, policies, it, had, greater, influence, on, cambodia, s, foreign, policy, successfully, pushing, the, country, to, pursue, rapprochement, with, thailand, and, open, communication, with, the, u, s, to, combat, vietnamese, influence, in, the, region, after, mao, died, in, september, 1976, pol, pot, praised, him, and, cambodia, declared, an, official, period, of, mourning, in, november, 1976, pol, pot, travelled, secretly, to, beijing, seeking, to, retain, his, country, s, alliance, with, china, after, the, gang, of, four, were, arrested, from, beijing, he, was, then, taken, on, a, tour, of, china, visiting, sites, associated, with, mao, and, the, chinese, communist, party, the, chinese, were, the, only, country, allowed, to, retain,

example, that, should, be, copied, by, other, revolutionary, movements, across, the, world, and, courted, marxist, leaders, from, burma, indonesia, malaysia, and, thailand, allowing, thai, marxists, to, establish, bases, along, the, cambodian, border, with, thailand, in, november, 1977, burma, s, ne, win, was, the, first, foreign, head, of, government, to, visit, democratic, kampuchea, followed, soon, after, by, romania, s, nicolae, ceau, escu, ben, kiernan, estimates, that, 1, 671, million, to, 1, 871, million, cambodians, died, as, a, result, of, khmer, rouge, policy, or, between, 21, and, 24, of, cambodia, s, 1975, population, a, study, by, french, demographer, marek, sliwinski, calculated, slightly, fewer, than, 2, million, unnatural, deaths, under, the, khmer, rouge, out, of, a, 1975, cambodian, population, of, 7, 8, million, 33, 5, of, cambodian, men, died, under, the, khmer, rouge, compared, to, 15, 7, of, cambodian, women, according, to, a, 2001, academic, source, the, most, widely, accepted, estimates, of, excess, deaths, under, the, khmer, rouge, range, from, 1, 5, million, to, 2, million, although, figures, as, low, as, 1, million, and, as, high, as, 3, million, have, been, cited, conventionally, accepted, estimates, of, deaths, due, to, khmer, rouge, executions, range, from, 500, 000, to, 1, million, a, third, to, one, half, of, excess, mortality, during, the, period, however, a, 2013, academic, source, citing, research, from, 2009, indicates, that, execution, may, have, accounted, for, as, much, as, 60, of, the, total, with, 23, 745, mass, graves, containing, approximately, 1, 3, million, suspected, victims, of, execution, while, considerably, higher, than, earlier, and, more, widely, accepted, estimates, of, khmer, rouge, executions, the, documentation, center, of, cambodia, dc, cam, s, craig, etcheson, defended, such, estimates, of, over, one, million, executions, as, plausible, given, the, nature, of, the, mass, grave, and, dc, cam, s, methods, which, are, more, likely, to, produce, an, under, count, of, bodies, rather, than, an, over, estimate, demographer, patrick, heuveline, estimated, that, between, 1, 17, million, and, 3, 42, million, cambodians, died, unnatural, deaths, between, 1970, and, 1979, with, between, 150, 000, and, 300, 000, of, those, deaths, occurring, during, the, civil, war, heuveline, s, central, estimate, is, 2, 52, million, excess, deaths, of, which, 1, 4, million, were, the, direct, result, of, violence, despite, being, based, on, a, house, to, house, survey, of, cambodians, the, estimate, of, 3, 3, million, deaths, promulgated, by, the, khmer, rouge, s, successor, regime, the, people, s, republic, of, kampuchea, prk, is, generally, considered, to, be, an, exaggeration, among, other, methodological, errors, the, prk, authorities, added, the, estimated, number, of, victims, that, had, been, found, in, the, partially, exhumed, mass, graves, to, the, raw, survey, results, meaning, that, some, victims, would, have, been, double, counted, an, estimated, 300, 000, cambodians, starved, to, death, between, 1979, and, 1980, largely, as, a, result, of, the, after, effects, of, khmer, rouge, policies, in, december, 1976, the, kampuchean, communist, party, central, committee, s, annual, plenum, proposed, the, country, ready, itself, for, the, prospect, of, war, with, vietnam, pol, pot, believed, that, vietnam, was, committed, to, expansionism, and, thus, was, a, threat, to, cambodian, independence, there, were, renewed, border, clashes, between, cambodia, and, vietnam, in, early, 1977, continuing, into, april, on, 30, april, cambodian, units, backed, by, artillery, fire, entered, vietnam, and, attacked, a, series, of, villages, killing, several, hundred, vietnamese, civilians, vietnam, responded, by, ordering, its, air, force, to, bomb, cambodian, border, positions, several, months, later, the, fighting, resumed, in, september, two, divisions, of, the, cambodian, eastern, zone, entered, the, tay, ninh, area, of, vietnam, where, they, attacked, several, villages, and, slaughtered, their, inhabitants, that, month, pol, pot, travelled, to, beijing, and, from, there, to, north, korea, where, kim, il, sung, spoke, out, against, vietnam, in, solidarity, with, the, khmer, rouge, in, december, vietnam, sent, 50, 000, troops, over, the, border, along, a, 100, mile, stretch, penetrating, 12, miles, into, cambodia, cambodia, then, formally, broke, off, diplomatic, relations, with, vietnam, cambodian, forces, fought, back, against, the, invaders, who, had, withdrawn, to, vietnam, by, 6, january, 1978, at, this, point, pol, pot, ordered, cambodia, s, military, to, take, an, aggressive, proactive, stance, attacking, vietnamese, troops, before, the, latter, had, the, chance, to, act, in, january, and, february, 1978, the, cambodian, army, launched, raids, on, various, vietnamese, villages, the, vietnamese, politburo, then, concluded, that, it, must, not, leave, pol, pot, in, power, but, must, remove, him, from, power, before, the, cambodian, military, strengthened, further, in, 1978, it, established, military, training, camps, for, cambodian, refugees, in, southern, vietnam, forming, the, nucleus, of, a, future, cambodian, regime, the, cambodian, government, also, readied, itself, for, war, plans, for, a, personality, cult, revolving, around, pol, pot, were, drawn, up, based, on, the, chinese, and, north, korean, models, in, the, belief, that, such, a, cult, would, unify, the, population, in, wartime, large, photographs, of, pol, pot, began, to, be, placed, in, communal, dining, halls, while, oil, paintings, and, busts, of, him, were, produced, the, cult, was, ultimately, never, implemented, the, failure, of, cambodian, troops, in, the, eastern, zone, to, successfully, resist, the, vietnamese, incursion, made, pol, pot, suspicious, of, their, allegiances, he, ordered, a, purge, of, the, eastern, zone, with, over, 400, cpk, cadres, from, the, area, being, sent, to, s, 21, aware, that, they, would, be, killed, on, pol, pot, s, orders, increasing, numbers, of, eastern, zone, troops, began, rebelling, against, the, khmer, rouge, government, pol, pot, sent, more, troops, into, the, eastern, zone, to, defeat, the, rebels, ordering, them, to, slaughter, the, inhabitants, of, any, villages, that, were, believed, to, be, harbouring, any, rebel, forces, this, suppression, in, the, east, was, according, to, short, the, bloodiest, single, episode, under, pol, pot, s, rule, fleeing, the, government, troops, many, leading, rebels, including, zone, deputy, chiefs, heng, samrin, and, pol, saroeun, made, it, into, vietnam, where, they, joined, the, anti, pol, pot, exile, community, by, august, 1978, pol, pot, could, only, consider, mok, s, forces, in, the, south, west, and, pauk, s, in, the, central, zone, as, being, reliable, early, in, 1978, pol, pot, s, government, began, trying, to, improve, relations, with, various, foreign, countries, such, as, thailand, to, bolster, its, position, against, vietnam, many, other, governments, in, southeast, asia, sympathised, with, cambodia, s, situation, fearing, the, impact, of, vietnamese, expansionism, and, soviet, influence, on, their, own, countries, although, supportive, of, the, cambodians, the, chinese, government, decided, not, to, send, its, army, into, cambodia, fearing, that, an, all, out, conflict, with, vietnam, could, provoke, a, war, with, the, soviet, union, meanwhile, vietnam, was, planning, its, full, scale, invasion, of, cambodia, in, december, 1978, it, formally, launched, the, khmer, national, united, front, for, national, salvation, knufns, a, group, made, up, of, cambodian, exiles, which, it, hoped, to, install, in, place, of, the, khmer, rouge, initially, knufns, was, headed, by, heng, samrin, fearing, this, vietnamese, threat, pol, pot, wrote, an, anti, vietnamese, tract, titled, the, black, paper, in, september, 1978, pol, pot, began, increasingly, courting, sihanouk, in, the, hope, that, the, latter, could, prove, a, rallying, point, in, support, of, the, khmer, rouge, government, that, same, month, pol, pot, flew, to, china, to, meet, with, deng, deng, condemned, vietnamese, aggression, but, suggested, that, the, khmer, rouge, had, precipitated, the, conflict, by, being, too, radical, in, its, policies, and, by, allowing, cambodian, troops, to, behave, anarchically, along, the, border, with, vietnam, on, returning, to, cambodia, in, october, pol, pot, ordered, the, country, s, army, to, switch, tactics, adopting, a, defensive, strategy, involving, the, heavy, use, of, land, mines, to, stop, vietnamese, incursions, he, also, cautioned, the, army, to, avoid, direct, confrontations, which, would, incur, heavy, losses, and, instead, adopt, guerrilla, tactics, in, november, 1978, the, cpk, held, its, fifth, congress, here, mok, was, appointed, the, third, ranked, figure, in, the, government, behind, pol, pot, and, nuon, chea, soon, after, the, congress, two, senior, government, members, vorn, vet, and, kong, sophal, were, arrested, and, sent, to, s, 21, this, precipitated, another, round, of, purges, on, 25, december, 1978, the, vietnamese, army, launched, its, full, scale, invasion, its, columns, initially, advanced, into, north, east, cambodia, taking, kratie, on, 30, december, and, stung, treng, on, 3, january, the, vietnamese, main, force, then, entered, cambodia, on, 1, january, 1979, heading, along, highways, one, and, seven, toward, phnom, penh, cambodia, s, forward, defences, failed, to, stop, them, with, an, attack, on, phnom, penh, imminent, in, january, pol, pot, ordered, sihanouk, and, his, family, to, be, sent, to, thailand, the, entire, diplomatic, corps, followed, shortly, after, on, 7, january, pol, pot, and, other, senior, government, figures, left, the, city, and, drove, to, pursat, they, spent, two, days, there, before, moving, on, to, battambang, after, the, khmer, rouge, evacuated, phnom, penh, mok, was, the, only, senior, government, figure, left, in, the, city, tasked, with, overseeing, its, defence, nuon, chear, ordered, the,

much, and, that, you, know, for, the, other, people, the, babies, the, young, ones, i, did, not, order, them, to, be, killed, in, late, july, pol, pot, and, the, three, khmer, rouge, commanders, who,

losses, to, the, cambodian, army, and, in, march, 1999, ta, mok, was, also, captured, and, the, khmer, rouge, effectively, ceased, to, exist, pol, s, aim, was, to, plunge, the, country, into, an, inferno, of, revolutionary, change, where, certainly, old, ideas, and, those, who, refused, to, abandon, them, would, perish, in, the, flames, but, from, which, cambodia, itself, would, emerge, strengthened, and, purified, as, a, paragon, of, communist, virtue, journalist, philip, short, 2004, short, noted, that, an, underlying, doctrinal, view, among, the, khmer, rouge, was, that, it, is, always, better, to, go, too, far, than, not, far, enough, an, approach, that, was, at, the, root, of, many, of, the, abuses, which, occurred, under, their, regime, within, the, khmer, rouge, itself, hunger, lack, of, sleep, and, long, hours, of, labour, were, employed, at, training, camps, to, ramp, up, the, physical, and, mental, pressure, and, thus, facilitate, indoctrination, short, commented, that, no, other, communist, party, in, history, ever, went, so, far, in, its, attempts, directly, to, remould, the, minds, of, its, members, pol, pot, disbanded, his, communist, party, during, the, 1980s, in, order, to, try, to, portray, himself, in, a, new, favorable, light, and, because, most, of, his, support, came, from, capitalist, nations, during, that, decade, pol, pot, frequently, commented, that, we, chose, communism, because, we, wanted, to, restore, our, nation, we, helped, the, vietnamese, who, were, communist, but, now, the, communists, are, fighting, us, so, we, have, to, turn, to, the, west, and, follow, their, way, this, action, led, short, to, suggest, that, the, veneer, of, marxism, leninism, which, had, cloaked, cambodian, radicalism, had, only, ever, been, skin, deep, before, his, death, in, 1997, he, proclaimed, that, when, i, die, my, only, wish, is, that, cambodia, remain, cambodia, and, belong, to, the, west, it, is, over, for, communism, and, i, want, to, stress, that, pol, pot, stated, that, he, was, inspired, by, what, he, saw, happening, in, india, with, gandhi, and, nehru, he, said, that, he, started, off, as, a, nationalist, and, then, a, patriot, before, reading, progressive, books, and, the, french, newspaper, l, humanite, while, in, paris, regarding, the, origin, of, his, political, views, he, remarked, that, i, cannot, tell, you, of, any, single, influence, maybe, it, s, a, little, from, here, a, little, from, there, short, observed, that, decision, making, in, pol, pot, s, cambodia, was, unruly, making, it, dissimilar, from, the, centralised, organised, processes, which, were, found, in, other, orthodox, communist, states, within, democratic, kampuchea, there, was, much, regional, and, local, variation, in, how, party, cadres, implemented, pol, pot, s, orders, deng, xiaoping, criticised, the, khmer, rouge, for, engaging, in, deviations, from, marxism, leninism, albania, s, enver, hoxha, referred, to, pot, as, a, barbarous, fascist, in, re, interpreting, the, revolutionary, role, of, classes, and, behind, the, thinnest, of, marxist, veneers, on, the, proletariat, pol, pot, embraced, the, idea, of, a, revolutionary, alliance, between, the, peasantry, and, the, intellectuals, pol, pot, s, government, was, totalitarian, and, he, has, been, described, as, a, dictator, pol, pot, desired, autarky, or, complete, self, sufficiency, for, cambodia, short, suggested, that, pol, pot, had, been, an, authentic, spokesman, for, the, yearning, that, many, khmer, felt, for, the, return, of, their, former, greatness, the, era, of, the, khmer, empire, chandler, noted, that, pol, pot, like, previous, cambodian, leaders, emphasised, the, belief, that, cambodia, was, purer, than, other, nations, the, party, leadership, has, been, described, as, xenophobic, pol, pot, repeatedly, stated, or, implied, that, cambodians, were, an, intrinsically, superior, group, to, other, ethnic, or, national, groups, and, that, they, were, immune, to, foreign, influences, short, also, noted, that, the, khmer, rouge, generally, regarded, foreigners, as, enemies, during, the, cambodian, civil, war, they, killed, numerous, foreign, journalists, whom, they, captured, whereas, the, vietnamese, marxists, typically, let, them, go, native, religions, were, banned, as, part, of, the, khmer, rouge, s, attempt, to, eliminate, religion, in, the, country, to, add, to, the, confusion, even, his, identity, remains, in, question, in, an, interview, with, yugoslav, television, in, 1977, pol, pot, said, he, had, come, from, a, poor, peasant, family, but, a, cambodian, refugee, in, paris, laau, phuok, insists, that, pol, pot, s, real, name, is, saloth, sar, and, that, his, father, was, a, landowner, distantly, related, to, the, royal, family, a, third, version, is, that, pol, pot, is, really, tol, sat, a, revolutionary, who, was, elected, to, the, khmer, rouge, people, s, representative, assembly, in, phnom, penh, in, 1976, to, complete, the, mystery, photographs, of, pol, pot, tend, to, change, in, appearance, ever, so, slightly, through, the, years, journalist, christopher, jones, 1981, david, chandler, characterized, pol, pot, as, having, a, thirst, for, power, being, introspective, self, effacing, and, displaying, self, control, he, was, also, described, as, being, highly, reclusive, obsessed, with, secrecy, and, fearful, of, the, threat, of, assassination, he, was, often, in, control, while, pretending, not, to, be, short, stated, that, he, delighted, in, appearing, to, be, what, he, was, not, a, nameless, face, in, the, crowd, during, his, political, career, he, used, a, wide, array, of, pseudonyms, pouk, hay, pol, 87, grand, uncle, elder, brother, first, brother, and, in, later, years, he, used, the, pseudonyms, 99, and, phem, he, told, a, secretary, that, the, more, often, you, change, your, name, the, better, it, confuses, the, enemy, in, later, life, he, concealed, and, falsified, many, details, of, his, life, he, never, explained, why, he, chose, the, pseudonym, pol, pot, although, in, 1997, william, t, vollmann, stated, that, it, was, derived, from, the, french, phrase, politique, potentiel, according, to, the, official, biography, of, pol, pot, published, in, september, 1978, by, the, department, of, press, and, information, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, of, democratic, kampuchea, pol, pot, liked, to, live, and, work, in, the, calm, he, had, a, large, spirit, of, union, he, showed, revolutionary, optimism, and, he, was, deeply, and, firmly, confident, in, the, people, the, masses, especially, in, the, poor, peasants, pol, pot, displayed, what, chandler, called, a, genteel, charisma, and, what, short, described, as, a, magnetic, personality, as, a, child, his, brother, characterized, him, as, having, been, sweet, tempered, and, equable, while, fellow, school, pupils, recalled, that, pol, pot, was, mediocre, but, pleasant, as, a, teacher, he, was, characterized, by, his, pupils, as, having, been, calm, honest, and, persuasive, having, an, evident, good, nature, and, an, attractive, personality, chandler, noted, that, he, had, the, common, touch, when, interacting, with, people, according, to, short, pol, pot, s, varied, and, eclectic, upbringing, meant, that, he, was, able, to, communicate, naturally, with, people, of, all, sorts, and, conditions, establishing, an, instinctive, rapport, that, invariably, made, them, want, to, like, him, many, observers, commented, on, his, distinctive, smile, when, speaking, to, audiences, he, usually, carried, a, fan, which, in, cambodian, culture, was, traditionally, associated, with, monkhood, pol, pot, was, softly, spoken, during, speeches, he, was, serene, and, calm, even, in, the, midst, of, using, violent, rhetoric, chandler, noted, that, when, meeting, with, people, pol, pot, displayed, an, apparent, warmth, and, was, known, for, his, slowly, uttered, words, kong, duong, who, worked, with, pol, pot, in, the, 1980s, said, that, he, was, very, likeable, a, really, nice, person, he, was, friendly, and, everything, he, said, seemed, very, sensible, he, would, never, blame, you, or, scold, you, to, your, face, pol, pot, suffered, from, insomnia, and, was, frequently, ill, he, suffered, from, malaria, and, intestinal, ailments, which, left, him, ill, several, times, a, year, whilst, he, was, in, power, as, well, as, having, a, love, of, traditional, khmer, music, in, childhood, he, became, interested, in, romantic, french, poetry, with, the, work, of, paul, verlaine, being, among, his, favorites, chandler, suggested, that, the, seven, years, that, pol, pot, primarily, spent, in, jungle, encampments, among, his, fellow, marxists, had, a, significant, effect, on, his, world, view, and, they, probably, reinforced, his, sense, of, destiny, and, self, importance, pol, pot, had, a, nationalistic, attitude, and, displayed, little, interest, in, events, outside, cambodia, he, was, self, righteous, and, typically, rejected, compromise, or, attempts, to, gain, a, consensus, short, related, that, pol, did, believe, he, was, acting, for, the, common, good, and, that, sooner, or, later, everyone, would, recognise, that, chandler, noted, that, pol, pot, displayed, a, tendency, towards, violence, and, terror, short, suggested, that, pol, pot, along, with, other, senior, members, of, the, khmer, rouge, engaged, in, the, glorification, of, violence, and, saw, bloodshed, as, a, cause, for, exultation, this, short, suggested, marked, the, khmer, rouge, s, leadership, out, as, being, different, from, those, who, led, the, chinese, and, vietnamese, marxist, movements, who, tended, to, see, violence, as, a, necessary, evil, rather, than, something, to, embrace, joyfully, pol, pot, wanted, his, followers, to, develop, a, revolutionary, consciousness, that, would, allow, them, to, act, without, his, guidance, and, was, often, disappointed, when, they, failed, to, display, this, partly, because, he, did, not, fully, trust, subordinates, he, micro, managed, events, scrutinising, things, such, as, menus, for, state, receptions, or, the, programming, schedules, for, radio, broadcasts, although, some, of, pol, pot, s, supporters, wanted, a, personality, cult, devoted, to, him, akin, to, those, in, other, marxist, governed, countries, this, never, successfully, emerged, in, cambodia, although, some, busts, and, paintings, of, him, were, produced, during, the, start, of, the, war, with, vietnam, cambodia, never, saw, songs, and, plays, written, about, him, his, photograph, was, not, included, in, party, literature, and, there, were, no, publication, of, his, thoughts, as, had, been, seen, with, leaders, in, countries, like, china, and, north, korea, chandler, thought, that, the, proposed, personality, cult, never, became, full, blown, in, large, part, because, self, advertisement, did, not, come, easily, to, pol, pot, it, may, also, have, reflected, his, sincere, opposition, to, individualism, chandler, described, pol, pot, as, one, of, the, visionary, leaders, of, cambodian, history, for, his, attempts, to, radically, transform, the, country, by, 1979, his, name, was, internationally, recognised, as, a, byword, for, mass, killings, and, chaos, in, its, obituary, notice, for, pol, pot, the, new, york, times, referred, to, him, as, the, creator, of, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, brutal, and, radical, regimes, both, the, bbc, news, and, time, magazine, blamed, his, government, for, one, of, the, worst, mass, killings, of, the, 20th, century, in, 2009, deutsche, welle, described, pol, pot, s, government, as, having, initiated, one, of, the, world, s, most, infamous, political, experiments, while, short, referred, to, the, khmer, rouge, as, the, most, radical, revolutionary, movement, of, modern, times, writing, for, the, u, s, socialist, magazine, jacobin, in, 2019, the, dutch, socialist, alex, de, jong, characterised, pol, pot, s, government, as, a, genocidal, regime, and, noted, that, the, name, of, the, khmer, rouge, had, become, synonymous, with, murder, and, repression, many, cambodians, who, lived, through, his, administration, later, referred, to, it, as, samai, a, pot, the, era, of, the, contemptible, pot, the, idea, that, the, deaths, which, occurred, under, pol, pot, s, government, should, be, considered, genocide, was, first, put, forward, by, the, vietnamese, government, in, 1979, after, the, revelations, of, the, killings, committed, at, tuol, sleng, prison, the, vietnamese, backed, prk, administration, swiftly, opened, the, prison, to, visitors, as, the, genocide, museum, short, argued, that, while, pol, pot, s, administration, was, clearly, responsible, for, crimes, against, humanity, it, was, misleading, to, accuse, it, of, genocide, because, it, never, sought, to, eradicate, an, entire, population, chandler, noted, that, while, cambodia, s, revolution, under, pol, pot, produced, millions, of, victims, it, also, had, some, beneficiaries, those, who, were, empowered, by, the, khmer, rouge, administration, either, probably, believed, pol, pot, s, claims, regarding, the, construction, of, a, socialist, society, or, vigorously, pretended, that, they, did, according, to, chandler, chandler, also, noted, that, pol, pot, s, supporters, believed, that, it, was, his, clear, sighted, strategies, and, tactics, that, had, wrested, control, of, cambodia, from, the, united, states, and, its, feudal, puppets, and, that, he, had, uprooted, enemies, from, the, party, encouraged, vigilance, built, the, alliance, with, china, and, masterminded, the, four, year, plan, during, the, war, with, vietnam, many, cambodians, revered, pol, pot, s, khmer, rouge, forces, as, nationalists, who, were, defending, the, country, internationally, his, movement, received, support, from, such, countries, as, china, thailand, and, the, united, states, during, that, conflict, because, they, saw, it, as, a, bulwark, against, vietnam, and, thus, vietnam, s, key, ally, the, soviet, union, various, groups, visited, pol, pot, s, government, while, it, was, in, power, the, small, canadian, communist, league, marxist, leninist, for, instance, sent, a, delegation, to, meet, with, him, in, phnom, penh, in, december, 1978, another, sympathiser, who, visited, pol, pot, that, year, was, the, scottish, communist, malcolm, caldwell, an, economic, historian, based, at, london, s, school, of, oriental, and, african, studies, he, met, with, pol, pot, but, was, murdered, shortly, afterward, the, culprit, was, never, identified, also, in, 1978, the, khmer, rouge, met, with, delegates, of, the, swedish, cambodian, friendship, association, whose, members, openly, sympathised, with, the, khmer, rouge, one, of, its, members, gunnar, bergstr, m, later, noted, that, in, the, 1970s, he, had, been, a, vietnam, war, protestor, who, had, become, dissatisfied, with, the, soviet, union, and, believed, that, the, cambodian, government, was, building, a, society, based, on, freedom, and, equality, in, his, view, the, khmer, rouge, regime, was, an, example, to, the, third, world, bergstr, m, noted, that, he, and, his, fellow, members, had, heard, about, atrocities, that, were, taking, place, but, did, not, want, to, believe, them, a, number, of, cultic, activities, and, practices, have, been, observed, around, pol, pot, s, grave, people, from, anlong, veng, but, also, from, other, parts, of, cambodia, go, to, his, grave, to, make, offerings, of, food, on, certain, holy, days, including, the, festival, of, the, dead, and, the, cambodian, new, year, some, people, make, daily, offerings, of, food, as, well, as, more, significant, offerings, such, as, a, pig, s, head, and, court, music, sung, by, an, orchestra, amanda, pike, an, investigative, journalist, who, has, visited, cambodia, states, that, some, of, pol, pot, s, supporters, still, cling, to, his, memory, and, ideology, and, she, also, states, that, some, fervent, believers, still, worship, him, she, reports, that, these, people, dig, through, pol, pot, s, ashes, and, snatch, up, fragments, of, his, bones, to, take, away, as, talismans, cambodian, villagers, say, that, they, dream, of, pol, pot, and, afterwards, they, win, the, lottery, or, become, cured, from, malaria, in, addition, people, kneel, down, near, his, grave, and, start, praying, they, chant, all, your, children, are, here, grandpa, don, t, say, that, we, ve, forgotten, you, they, ask, for, good, health, and, for, their, children, to, be, educated, just, like, pol, pot, was, when, asked, about, why, they, go, to, pol, pot, s, grave, some, say, they, knew, him, personally, others, say, that, they, go, to, pay, their, respects, to, a, former, leader, most, seem, to, perceive, that, some, part, of, the, world, thinks, of, pol, pot, in, a, negative, light, however, they, insist, that, he, was, a, supporter, of, the, common, farmer, and, a, defender, of, cambodia, there, have, also, been, cases, of, people, claiming, to, have, dreamed, of, pol, pot, and, sleepwalked, towards, his, grave
