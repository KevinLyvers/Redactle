and, a, pioneer, in, the, development, of, opera, he, is, considered, a, crucial, transitional, figure, between, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, of, music, history, born, in, cremona, where, he, undertook, his, first, musical, studies, and, compositions, monteverdi, developed, his, career, first, at, the, court, of, mantua, c, 1590, 1613, and, then, until, his, death, in, the, republic, of, venice, where, he, was, maestro, di, cappella, at, the, basilica, of, san, marco, his, surviving, letters, give, insight, into, the, life, of, a, professional, musician, in, italy, of, the, period, including, problems, of, income, patronage, and, politics, much, of, monteverdi, s, output, including, many, stage, works, has, been, lost, his, surviving, music, includes, nine, books, of, madrigals, large, scale, religious, works, such, as, his, vespro, della, beata, vergine, vespers, for, the, blessed, virgin, of, 1610, and, three, complete, operas, his, opera, l, orfeo, 1607, is, the, earliest, of, the, genre, still, widely, performed, towards, the, end, of, his, life, he, wrote, works, for, venice, including, il, ritorno, d, ulisse, in, patria, and, l, incoronazione, di, poppea, while, he, worked, extensively, in, the, tradition, of, earlier, renaissance, polyphony, as, evidenced, in, his, madrigals, he, undertook, great, developments, in, form, and, melody, and, began, to, employ, the, basso, continuo, technique, distinctive, of, the, baroque, no, stranger, to, controversy, he, defended, his, sometimes, novel, techniques, as, elements, of, a, seconda, pratica, contrasting, with, the, more, orthodox, earlier, style, which, he, termed, the, prima, pratica, largely, forgotten, during, the, eighteenth, and, much, of, the, nineteenth, centuries, his, works, enjoyed, a, rediscovery, around, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, he, is, now, established, both, as, a, significant, influence, in, european, musical, history, and, as, a, composer, whose, works, are, regularly, performed, and, recorded, monteverdi, was, baptised, in, the, church, of, ss, nazaro, e, celso, cremona, on, 15, may, 1567, the, register, records, his, name, as, claudio, zuan, antonio, the, son, of, messer, baldasar, mondeverdo, he, was, the, first, child, of, the, apothecary, baldassare, monteverdi, and, his, first, wife, maddalena, n, e, zignani, they, had, married, early, the, previous, year, claudio, s, brother, giulio, cesare, monteverdi, b, 1573, was, also, to, become, a, musician, there, were, two, other, brothers, and, two, sisters, from, baldassare, s, marriage, to, maddalena, and, his, subsequent, marriage, in, 1576, or, 1577, cremona, was, close, to, the, border, of, the, republic, of, venice, and, not, far, from, the, lands, controlled, by, the, duchy, of, mantua, in, both, of, which, states, monteverdi, was, later, to, establish, his, career, there, is, no, clear, record, of, monteverdi, s, early, musical, training, or, evidence, that, as, is, sometimes, claimed, he, was, a, member, of, the, cathedral, choir, or, studied, at, cremona, university, monteverdi, s, first, published, work, a, set, of, motets, sacrae, cantiunculae, sacred, songs, for, three, voices, was, issued, in, venice, in, 1582, when, he, was, only, fifteen, years, old, in, this, and, his, other, initial, publications, he, describes, himself, as, the, pupil, of, marc, antonio, ingegneri, who, was, from, 1581, and, possibly, from, 1576, to, 1592, the, maestro, di, cappella, at, cremona, cathedral, the, musicologist, tim, carter, deduces, that, ingegneri, gave, him, a, solid, grounding, in, counterpoint, and, composition, and, that, monteverdi, would, also, have, studied, playing, instruments, of, the, viol, family, and, singing, monteverdi, s, first, publications, also, give, evidence, of, his, connections, beyond, cremona, even, in, his, early, years, his, second, published, work, madrigali, spirituali, spiritual, madrigals, 1583, was, printed, at, brescia, his, next, works, his, first, published, secular, compositions, were, sets, of, five, part, madrigals, according, to, his, biographer, paolo, fabbri, the, inevitable, proving, ground, for, any, composer, of, the, second, half, of, the, sixteenth, century, the, secular, genre, par, excellence, the, first, book, of, madrigals, venice, 1587, was, dedicated, to, count, marco, verit, of, verona, the, second, book, of, madrigals, venice, 1590, was, dedicated, to, the, president, of, the, senate, of, milan, giacomo, ricardi, for, whom, he, had, played, the, viola, da, braccio, in, 1587, in, the, dedication, of, his, second, book, of, madrigals, monteverdi, had, described, himself, as, a, player, of, the, vivuola, which, could, mean, either, viola, da, gamba, or, viola, da, braccio, in, 1590, or, 1591, he, entered, the, service, of, duke, vincenzo, i, gonzaga, of, mantua, he, recalled, in, his, dedication, to, the, duke, of, his, third, book, of, madrigals, venice, 1592, that, the, most, noble, exercise, of, the, vivuola, opened, to, me, the, fortunate, way, into, your, service, in, the, same, dedication, he, compares, his, instrumental, playing, to, flowers, and, his, compositions, as, fruit, which, as, it, matures, can, more, worthily, and, more, perfectly, serve, you, indicating, his, intentions, to, establish, himself, as, a, composer, duke, vincenzo, was, keen, to, establish, his, court, as, a, musical, centre, and, sought, to, recruit, leading, musicians, when, monteverdi, arrived, in, mantua, the, maestro, di, capella, at, the, court, was, the, flemish, musician, giaches, de, wert, other, notable, musicians, at, the, court, during, this, period, included, the, composer, and, violinist, salomone, rossi, rossi, s, sister, the, singer, madama, europa, and, francesco, rasi, monteverdi, married, the, court, singer, claudia, de, cattaneis, in, 1599, they, were, to, have, three, children, two, sons, francesco, b, 1601, and, massimiliano, b, 1604, and, a, daughter, who, died, soon, after, birth, in, 1603, monteverdi, s, brother, giulio, cesare, joined, the, court, musicians, in, 1602, when, wert, died, in, 1596, his, post, was, given, to, benedetto, pallavicino, but, monteverdi, was, clearly, highly, regarded, by, vincenzo, and, accompanied, him, on, his, military, campaigns, in, hungary, 1595, and, also, on, a, visit, to, flanders, in, 1599, here, at, the, town, of, spa, he, is, reported, by, his, brother, giulio, cesare, as, encountering, and, bringing, back, to, italy, the, canto, alla, francese, the, meaning, of, this, literally, song, in, the, french, style, is, debatable, but, may, refer, to, the, french, influenced, poetry, of, gabriello, chiabrera, some, of, which, was, set, by, monteverdi, in, his, scherzi, musicali, and, which, departs, from, the, traditional, italian, style, of, lines, of, 9, or, 11, syllables, monteverdi, may, possibly, have, been, a, member, of, vincenzo, s, entourage, at, florence, in, 1600, for, the, marriage, of, maria, de, medici, and, henry, iv, of, france, at, which, celebrations, jacopo, peri, s, opera, euridice, the, earliest, surviving, opera, was, premiered, on, the, death, of, pallavicino, in, 1601, monteverdi, was, confirmed, as, the, new, maestro, di, capella, at, the, turn, of, the, 17th, century, monteverdi, found, himself, the, target, of, musical, controversy, the, influential, bolognese, theorist, giovanni, maria, artusi, attacked, monteverdi, s, music, without, naming, the, composer, in, his, work, l, artusi, overo, delle, imperfettioni, della, moderna, musica, artusi, or, on, the, imperfections, of, modern, music, of, 1600, followed, by, a, sequel, in, 1603, artusi, cited, extracts, from, monteverdi, s, works, not, yet, published, they, later, formed, parts, of, his, fourth, and, fifth, books, of, madrigals, of, 1603, and, 1605, condemning, their, use, of, harmony, and, their, innovations, in, use, of, musical, modes, compared, to, orthodox, polyphonic, practice, of, the, sixteenth, century, artusi, attempted, to, correspond, with, monteverdi, on, these, issues, the, composer, refused, to, respond, but, found, a, champion, in, a, pseudonymous, supporter, l, ottuso, academico, the, obtuse, academic, eventually, monteverdi, replied, in, the, preface, to, the, fifth, book, of, madrigals, that, his, duties, at, court, prevented, him, from, a, detailed, reply, but, in, a, note, to, the, studious, reader, he, claimed, that, he, would, shortly, publish, a, response, seconda, pratica, overo, perfettione, della, moderna, musica, the, second, style, or, perfection, of, modern, music, this, work, never, appeared, but, a, later, publication, by, claudio, s, brother, giulio, cesare, made, it, clear, that, the, seconda, pratica, which, monteverdi, defended, was, not, seen, by, him, as, a, radical, change, or, his, own, invention, but, was, an, evolution, from, previous, styles, prima, pratica, which, was, complementary, to, them, this, debate, seems, in, any, case, to, have, raised, the, composer, s, profile, leading, to, reprints, of, his, earlier, books, of, madrigals, some, of, his, madrigals, were, published, in, copenhagen, in, 1605, and, 1606, and, the, poet, tommaso, stigliani, 1573, 1651, published, a, eulogy, of, him, in, his, 1605, poem, o, sirene, de, fiumi, the, composer, of, madrigal, comedies, and, theorist, adriano, banchieri, wrote, in, 1609, i, must, not, neglect, to, mention, the, most, noble, of, composers, monteverdi, his, expressive, qualities, are, truly, deserving, of, the, highest, commendation, and, we, find, in, them, countless, examples, of, matchless, declamation, enhanced, by, comparable, harmonies, the, modern, music, historian, massimo, ossi, has, placed, the, artusi, issue, in, the, context, of, monteverdi, s, artistic, development, if, the, controversy, seems, to, define, monteverdi, s, historical, position, it, also, seems, to, have, been, about, stylistic, developments, that, by, 1600, monteverdi, had, already, outgrown, the, non, appearance, of, monteverdi, s, promised, explanatory, treatise, may, have, been, a, deliberate, ploy, since, by, 1608, by, monteverdi, s, reckoning, artusi, had, become, fully, reconciled, to, modern, trends, in, music, and, the, seconda, pratica, was, by, then, well, established, monteverdi, had, no, need, to, revisit, the, issue, on, the, other, hand, letters, to, giovanni, battista, doni, of, 1632, show, that, monteverdi, was, still, preparing, a, defence, of, the, seconda, practica, in, a, treatise, entitled, melodia, he, may, still, have, been, working, on, this, at, the, time, of, his, death, ten, years, later, in, 1606, vincenzo, s, heir, francesco, commissioned, from, monteverdi, the, opera, l, orfeo, to, a, libretto, by, alessandro, striggio, for, the, carnival, season, of, 1607, it, was, given, two, performances, in, february, and, march, 1607, the, singers, included, in, the, title, role, rasi, who, had, sung, in, the, first, performance, of, euridice, witnessed, by, vincenzo, in, 1600, this, was, followed, in, 1608, by, the, opera, l, arianna, libretto, by, ottavio, rinuccini, intended, for, the, celebration, of, the, marriage, of, francesco, to, margherita, of, savoy, all, the, music, for, this, opera, is, lost, apart, from, ariadne, s, lament, which, became, extremely, popular, to, this, period, also, belongs, the, ballet, entertainment, il, ballo, delle, ingrate, the, strain, of, the, hard, work, monteverdi, had, been, putting, into, these, and, other, compositions, was, exacerbated, by, personal, tragedies, his, wife, died, in, september, 1607, and, the, young, singer, caterina, martinelli, intended, for, the, title, role, of, arianna, died, of, smallpox, in, march, 1608, monteverdi, also, resented, his, increasingly, poor, financial, treatment, by, the, gonzagas, he, retired, to, cremona, in, 1608, to, convalesce, and, wrote, a, bitter, letter, to, vincenzo, s, minister, annibale, chieppio, in, november, of, that, year, seeking, unsuccessfully, an, honourable, dismissal, although, the, duke, increased, monteverdi, s, salary, and, pension, and, monteverdi, returned, to, continue, his, work, at, the, court, he, began, to, seek, patronage, elsewhere, after, publishing, his, vespers, in, 1610, which, were, dedicated, to, pope, paul, v, he, visited, rome, ostensibly, hoping, to, place, his, son, francesco, at, a, seminary, but, apparently, also, seeking, alternative, employment, in, the, same, year, he, may, also, have, visited, venice, where, a, large, collection, of, his, church, music, was, being, printed, with, a, similar, intention, duke, vincenzo, died, on, 18, february, 1612, when, francesco, succeeded, him, court, intrigues, and, cost, cutting, led, to, the, dismissal, of, monteverdi, and, his, brother, giulio, cesare, who, both, returned, almost, penniless, to, cremona, despite, francesco, s, own, death, from, smallpox, in, december, 1612, monteverdi, was, unable, to, return, to, favour, with, his, successor, his, brother, cardinal, ferdinando, gonzaga, in, 1613, following, the, death, of, giulio, cesare, martinengo, monteverdi, auditioned, for, his, post, as, maestro, at, the, basilica, of, san, marco, in, venice, for, which, he, submitted, music, for, a, mass, he, was, appointed, in, august, 1613, and, given, 50, ducats, for, his, expenses, of, which, he, was, robbed, together, with, his, other, belongings, by, highwaymen, at, sanguinetto, on, his, return, to, cremona, martinengo, had, been, ill, for, some, time, before, his, death, and, had, left, the, music, of, san, marco, in, a, fragile, state, the, choir, had, been, neglected, and, the, administration, overlooked, when, monteverdi, arrived, to, take, up, his, post, his, principal, responsibility, was, to, recruit, train, discipline, and, manage, the, musicians, of, san, marco, the, capella, who, amounted, to, about, 30, singers, and, six, instrumentalists, the, numbers, could, be, increased, for, major, events, among, the, recruits, to, the, choir, was, francesco, cavalli, who, joined, in, 1616, at, the, age, of, 14, he, remained, connected, with, san, marco, throughout, his, life, and, developed, a, close, association, with, monteverdi, monteverdi, also, sought, to, expand, the, repertory, including, not, only, the, traditional, a, cappella, repertoire, of, roman, and, flemish, composers, but, also, examples, of, the, modern, style, which, he, favoured, including, the, use, of, continuo, and, other, instruments, apart, from, this, he, was, of, course, expected, to, compose, music, for, all, the, major, feasts, of, the, church, this, included, a, new, mass, each, year, for, holy, cross, day, and, christmas, eve, cantatas, in, honour, of, the, venetian, doge, and, numerous, other, works, many, of, which, are, lost, monteverdi, was, also, free, to, obtain, income, by, providing, music, for, other, venetian, churches, and, for, other, patrons, and, was, frequently, commissioned, to, provide, music, for, state, banquets, the, procurators, of, san, marco, to, whom, monteverdi, was, directly, responsible, showed, their, satisfaction, with, his, work, in, 1616, by, raising, his, annual, salary, from, 300, ducats, to, 400, the, relative, freedom, which, the, republic, of, venice, afforded, him, compared, to, the, problems, of, court, politics, in, mantua, are, reflected, in, monteverdi, s, letters, to, striggio, particularly, his, letter, of, 13, march, 1620, when, he, rejects, an, invitation, to, return, to, mantua, extolling, his, present, position, and, finances, in, venice, and, referring, to, the, pension, which, mantua, still, owes, him, nonetheless, remaining, a, mantuan, citizen, he, accepted, commissions, from, the, new, duke, ferdinando, who, had, formally, renounced, his, position, as, cardinal, in, 1616, to, take, on, the, duties, of, state, these, included, the, balli, tirsi, e, clori, 1616, and, apollo, 1620, an, opera, andromeda, 1620, and, an, intermedio, le, nozze, di, tetide, for, the, marriage, of, ferdinando, with, caterina, de, medici, 1617, most, of, these, compositions, were, extensively, delayed, in, creation, partly, as, shown, by, surviving, correspondence, through, the, composer, s, unwillingness, to, prioritise, them, and, partly, because, of, constant, changes, in, the, court, s, requirements, they, are, now, lost, apart, from, tirsi, e, clori, which, was, included, in, the, seventh, book, of, madrigals, published, 1619, and, dedicated, to, the, duchess, caterina, for, which, the, composer, received, a, pearl, necklace, from, the, duchess, a, subsequent, major, commission, the, opera, la, finta, pazza, licori, to, a, libretto, by, giulio, strozzi, was, completed, for, fernando, s, successor, vincenzo, ii, who, succeeded, to, the, dukedom, in, 1626, because, of, the, latter, s, illness, he, died, in, 1627, it, was, never, performed, and, it, is, now, also, lost, monteverdi, also, received, commissions, from, other, italian, states, and, from, their, communities, in, venice, these, included, for, the, milanese, community, in, 1620, music, for, the, feast, of, st, charles, borromeo, and, for, the, florentine, community, a, requiem, mass, for, cosimo, ii, de, medici, 1621, monteverdi, acted, on, behalf, of, paolo, giordano, ii, duke, of, bracciano, to, arrange, publication, of, works, by, the, cremona, musician, francesco, petratti, among, monteverdi, s, private, venetian, patrons, was, the, nobleman, girolamo, mocenigo, at, whose, home, was, premiered, in, 1624, the, dramatic, entertainment, il, combattimento, di, tancredi, e, clorinda, based, on, an, episode, from, torquato, tasso, s, la, gerusalemme, liberata, in, 1627, monteverdi, received, a, major, commission, from, odoardo, farnese, duke, of, parma, for, a, series, of, works, and, gained, leave, from, the, procurators, to, spend, time, there, during, 1627, and, 1628, monteverdi, s, musical, direction, received, the, attention, of, foreign, visitors, the, dutch, diplomat, and, musician, constantijn, huygens, attending, a, vespers, service, at, the, church, of, ss, giovanni, e, lucia, wrote, that, he, heard, the, most, perfect, music, i, had, ever, heard, in, my, life, it, was, directed, by, the, most, famous, claudio, monteverdi, who, was, also, the, composer, and, was, accompanied, by, four, theorbos, two, cornettos, two, bassoons, one, basso, de, viola, of, huge, size, organs, and, other, instruments, monteverdi, wrote, a, mass, and, provided, other, musical, entertainment, for, the, visit, to, venice, in, 1625, of, the, crown, prince, w, adys, aw, of, poland, who, may, have, sought, to, revive, attempts, made, a, few, years, previously, to, lure, monteverdi, to, warsaw, he, also, provided, chamber, music, for, wolfgang, wilhelm, count, palatine, of, neuburg, when, the, latter, was, paying, an, incognito, visit, to, venice, in, july, 1625, correspondence, of, monteverdi, in, 1625, and, 1626, with, the, mantuan, courtier, ercole, marigliani, reveals, an, interest, in, alchemy, which, apparently, monteverdi, had, taken, up, as, a, hobby, he, discusses, experiments, to, transform, lead, into, gold, the, problems, of, obtaining, mercury, and, mentions, commissioning, special, vessels, for, his, experiments, from, the, glassworks, at, murano, despite, his, generally, satisfactory, situation, in, venice, monteverdi, experienced, personal, problems, from, time, to, time, he, was, on, one, occasion, probably, because, of, his, wide, network, of, contacts, the, subject, of, an, anonymous, denunciation, to, the, venetian, authorities, alleging, that, he, supported, the, habsburgs, he, was, also, subject, to, anxieties, about, his, children, his, son, francesco, while, a, student, of, law, at, padua, in, 1619, was, spending, in, monteverdi, s, opinion, too, much, time, with, music, and, he, therefore, moved, him, to, the, university, of, bologna, this, change, did, not, have, the, desired, result, and, it, seems, that, monteverdi, resigned, himself, to, francesco, having, a, musical, career, he, joined, the, choir, of, san, marco, in, 1623, his, other, son, massimiliano, who, graduated, in, medicine, was, arrested, by, the, inquisition, in, mantua, in, 1627, for, reading, forbidden, literature, monteverdi, was, obliged, to, sell, the, necklace, he, had, received, from, duchess, caterina, to, pay, for, his, son, s, eventually, successful, defence, monteverdi, wrote, at, the, time, to, striggio, seeking, his, help, and, fearing, that, massimiliano, might, be, subject, to, torture, it, seems, that, striggio, s, intervention, was, helpful, money, worries, at, this, time, also, led, monteverdi, to, visit, cremona, to, secure, for, himself, a, church, canonry, a, series, of, disturbing, events, troubled, monteverdi, s, world, in, the, period, around, 1630, mantua, was, invaded, by, habsburg, armies, in, 1630, who, besieged, the, plague, stricken, town, and, after, its, fall, in, july, looted, its, treasures, and, dispersed, the, artistic, community, the, plague, was, carried, to, mantua, s, ally, venice, by, an, embassy, led, by, monteverdi, s, confidante, striggio, and, over, a, period, of, 16, months, led, to, over, 45, 000, deaths, leaving, venice, s, population, in, 1633, at, just, above, 100, 000, the, lowest, level, for, about, 150, years, among, the, plague, victims, was, monteverdi, s, assistant, at, san, marco, and, a, notable, composer, in, his, own, right, alessandro, grandi, the, plague, and, the, after, effects, of, war, had, an, inevitable, deleterious, effect, on, the, economy, and, artistic, life, of, venice, monteverdi, s, younger, brother, giulio, cesare, also, died, at, this, time, probably, from, the, plague, by, this, time, monteverdi, was, in, his, sixties, and, his, rate, of, composition, seems, to, have, slowed, down, he, had, written, a, setting, of, strozzi, s, proserpina, rapita, the, abduction, of, proserpina, now, lost, except, for, one, vocal, trio, for, a, mocenigo, wedding, in, 1630, and, produced, a, mass, for, deliverance, from, the, plague, for, san, marco, which, was, performed, in, november, 1631, his, set, of, scherzi, musicali, was, published, in, venice, in, 1632, in, 1631, monteverdi, was, admitted, to, the, tonsure, and, was, ordained, deacon, and, later, priest, in, 1632, although, these, ceremonies, took, place, in, venice, he, was, nominated, as, a, member, of, diocese, of, cremona, this, may, imply, that, he, intended, to, retire, there, the, opening, of, the, opera, house, of, san, cassiano, in, 1637, the, first, public, opera, house, in, europe, stimulated, the, city, s, musical, life, and, coincided, with, a, new, burst, of, the, composer, s, activity, the, year, 1638, saw, the, publication, of, monteverdi, s, eighth, book, of, madrigals, and, a, revision, of, the, ballo, delle, ingrate, the, eighth, book, contains, a, ballo, volgendi, il, ciel, which, may, have, been, composed, for, the, holy, roman, emperor, ferdinand, iii, to, whom, the, book, is, dedicated, the, years, 1640, 1641, saw, the, publication, of, the, extensive, collection, of, church, music, selva, morale, e, spirituale, among, other, commissions, monteverdi, wrote, music, in, 1637, and, 1638, for, strozzi, s, accademia, degli, unisoni, in, venice, and, in, 1641, a, ballet, la, vittoria, d, amore, for, the, court, of, piacenza, monteverdi, was, still, not, entirely, free, from, his, responsibilities, for, the, musicians, at, san, marco, he, wrote, to, complain, about, one, of, his, singers, to, the, procurators, on, 9, june, 1637, i, claudio, monteverdi, come, humbly, to, set, forth, to, you, how, domenicato, aldegati, a, bass, yesterday, morning, at, the, time, of, the, greatest, concourse, of, people, spoke, these, exact, words, the, director, of, music, comes, from, a, brood, of, cut, throat, bastards, a, thieving, fucking, he, goat, and, i, shit, on, him, and, whoever, protects, him, monteverdi, s, contribution, to, opera, at, this, period, is, notable, he, revised, his, earlier, opera, l, arianna, in, 1640, and, wrote, three, new, works, for, the, commercial, stage, il, ritorno, d, ulisse, in, patria, the, return, of, ulysses, to, his, homeland, 1640, first, performed, in, bologna, with, venetian, singers, le, nozze, d, enea, e, lavinia, the, marriage, of, aeneas, and, lavinia, 1641, music, now, lost, and, l, incoronazione, di, poppea, the, coronation, of, poppea, 1643, the, introduction, to, the, printed, scenario, of, le, nozze, d, enea, by, an, unknown, author, acknowledges, that, monteverdi, is, to, be, credited, for, the, rebirth, of, theatrical, music, and, that, he, will, be, sighed, for, in, later, ages, for, his, compositions, will, surely, outlive, the, ravages, of, time, in, his, last, surviving, letter, 20, august, 1643, monteverdi, already, ill, was, still, hoping, for, the, settlement, of, the, long, disputed, pension, from, mantua, and, asked, the, doge, of, venice, to, intervene, on, his, behalf, he, died, in, venice, on, 29, november, 1643, after, paying, a, brief, visit, to, cremona, and, is, buried, in, the, church, of, the, frari, he, was, survived, by, his, sons, masimilliano, died, in, 1661, francesco, after, 1677, there, is, a, consensus, among, music, historians, that, a, period, extending, from, the, mid, 15th, century, to, around, 1625, characterised, in, lewis, lockwood, s, phrase, by, substantial, unity, of, outlook, and, language, should, be, identified, as, the, period, of, renaissance, music, musical, literature, has, also, defined, the, succeeding, period, covering, music, from, approximately, 1580, to, 1750, as, the, era, of, baroque, music, it, is, in, the, late, 16th, to, early, 17th, century, overlap, of, these, periods, that, much, of, monteverdi, s, creativity, flourished, he, stands, as, a, transitional, figure, between, the, renaissance, and, the, baroque, in, the, renaissance, era, music, had, developed, as, a, formal, discipline, a, pure, science, of, relationships, in, the, words, of, lockwood, in, the, baroque, era, it, became, a, form, of, aesthetic, expression, increasingly, used, to, adorn, religious, social, and, festive, celebrations, in, which, in, accordance, with, plato, s, ideal, the, music, was, subordinated, to, the, text, solo, singing, with, instrumental, accompaniment, or, monody, acquired, greater, significance, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, replacing, polyphony, as, the, principal, means, of, dramatic, music, expression, this, was, the, changing, world, in, which, monteverdi, was, active, percy, scholes, in, his, oxford, companion, to, music, describes, the, new, music, thus, discarded, the, choral, polyphony, of, the, madrigal, style, as, barbaric, and, set, dialogue, or, soliloquy, for, single, voices, imitating, more, or, less, the, inflexions, of, speech, and, accompanying, the, voice, by, playing, mere, supporting, chords, short, choruses, were, interspersed, but, they, too, were, homophonic, rather, than, polyphonic, marc, antonio, ingegneri, monteverdi, s, first, tutor, was, a, master, of, the, musica, reservata, vocal, style, which, involved, the, use, of, chromatic, progressions, and, word, painting, monteverdi, s, early, compositions, were, grounded, in, this, style, ingegneri, was, a, traditional, renaissance, composer, something, of, an, anachronism, according, to, arnold, but, monteverdi, also, studied, the, work, of, more, modern, composers, such, as, luca, marenzio, luzzasco, luzzaschi, and, a, little, later, giaches, de, wert, from, whom, he, would, learn, the, art, of, expressing, passion, he, was, a, precocious, and, productive, student, as, indicated, by, his, youthful, publications, of, 1582, 83, mark, ringer, writes, that, these, teenaged, efforts, reveal, palpable, ambition, matched, with, a, convincing, mastery, of, contemporary, style, but, at, this, stage, they, display, their, creator, s, competence, rather, than, any, striking, originality, geoffrey, chew, classifies, them, as, not, in, the, most, modern, vein, for, the, period, acceptable, but, out, of, date, chew, rates, the, canzonette, collection, of, 1584, much, more, highly, than, the, earlier, juvenilia, these, brief, three, voice, pieces, draw, on, the, airy, modern, style, of, the, villanellas, of, marenzio, a, substantial, vocabulary, of, text, related, madrigalisms, the, canzonetta, form, was, much, used, by, composers, of, the, day, as, a, technical, exercise, and, is, a, prominent, element, in, monteverdi, s, first, book, of, madrigals, published, in, 1587, in, this, book, the, playful, pastoral, settings, again, reflect, the, style, of, marenzio, while, luzzaschi, s, influence, is, evident, in, monteverdi, s, use, of, dissonance, the, second, book, 1590, begins, with, a, setting, modelled, on, marenzio, of, a, modern, verse, torquato, tasso, s, non, si, levav, ancor, and, concludes, with, a, text, from, 50, years, earlier, pietro, bembo, s, cantai, un, tempo, monteverdi, set, the, latter, to, music, in, an, archaic, style, reminiscent, of, the, long, dead, cipriano, de, rore, between, them, is, ecco, mormorar, l, onde, strongly, influenced, by, de, wert, and, hailed, by, chew, as, the, great, masterpiece, of, the, second, book, a, thread, common, throughout, these, early, works, is, monteverdi, s, use, of, the, technique, of, imitatio, a, general, practice, among, composers, of, the, period, whereby, material, from, earlier, or, contemporary, composers, was, used, as, models, for, their, own, work, monteverdi, continued, to, use, this, procedure, well, beyond, his, apprentice, years, a, factor, that, in, some, critics, eyes, has, compromised, his, reputation, for, originality, monteverdi, s, first, fifteen, years, of, service, in, mantua, are, bracketed, by, his, publications, of, the, third, book, of, madrigals, in, 1592, and, the, fourth, and, fifth, books, in, 1603, and, 1605, between, 1592, and, 1603, he, made, minor, contributions, to, other, anthologies, how, much, he, composed, in, this, period, is, a, matter, of, conjecture, his, many, duties, in, the, mantuan, court, may, have, limited, his, opportunities, but, several, of, the, madrigals, that, he, published, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, books, were, written, and, performed, during, the, 1590s, some, figuring, prominently, in, the, artusi, controversy, the, third, book, shows, strongly, the, increased, influence, of, wert, by, that, time, monteverdi, s, direct, superior, as, maestro, de, capella, at, mantua, two, poets, dominate, the, collection, tasso, whose, lyrical, poetry, had, figured, prominently, in, the, second, book, but, is, here, represented, through, the, more, epic, heroic, verses, from, gerusalemme, liberata, and, giovanni, battista, guarini, whose, verses, had, appeared, sporadically, in, monteverdi, s, earlier, publications, but, form, around, half, of, the, contents, of, the, third, book, wert, s, influence, is, reflected, in, monteverdi, s, forthrightly, modern, approach, and, his, expressive, and, chromatic, settings, of, tasso, s, verses, of, the, guarini, settings, chew, writes, the, epigrammatic, style, closely, matches, a, poetic, and, musical, ideal, of, the, period, often, depends, on, strong, final, cadential, progressions, with, or, without, the, intensification, provided, by, chains, of, suspended, dissonances, chew, cites, the, setting, of, stracciami, pur, il, core, as, a, prime, example, of, monteverdi, s, irregular, dissonance, practice, tasso, and, guarini, were, both, regular, visitors, to, the, mantuan, court, monteverdi, s, association, with, them, and, his, absorption, of, their, ideas, may, have, helped, lay, the, foundations, of, his, own, approach, to, the, musical, dramas, that, he, would, create, a, decade, later, as, the, 1590s, progressed, monteverdi, moved, closer, towards, the, form, that, he, would, identify, in, due, course, as, the, seconda, pratica, claude, v, palisca, quotes, the, madrigal, ohim, se, tanto, amate, published, in, the, fourth, book, but, written, before, 1600, it, is, among, the, works, attacked, by, artusi, as, a, typical, example, of, the, composer, s, developing, powers, of, invention, in, this, madrigal, monteverdi, again, departs, from, the, established, practice, in, the, use, of, dissonance, by, means, of, a, vocal, ornament, palisca, describes, as, chapp, monteverdi, s, daring, use, of, this, device, is, says, palisca, like, a, forbidden, pleasure, in, this, and, in, other, settings, the, poet, s, images, were, supreme, even, at, the, expense, of, musical, consistency, the, fourth, book, includes, madrigals, to, which, artusi, objected, on, the, grounds, of, their, modernism, however, ossi, describes, it, as, an, anthology, of, disparate, works, firmly, rooted, in, the, 16th, century, closer, in, nature, to, the, third, book, than, to, the, fifth, besides, tasso, and, guarini, monteverdi, set, to, music, verses, by, rinuccini, maurizio, moro, s, ch, io, vorrei, morire, and, ridolfo, arlotti, luci, serene, e, chiare, there, is, evidence, of, the, composer, s, familiarity, with, the, works, of, carlo, gesualdo, and, with, composers, of, the, school, of, ferrara, such, as, luzzaschi, the, book, was, dedicated, to, a, ferrarese, musical, society, the, accademici, intrepidi, the, fifth, book, looks, more, to, the, future, for, example, monteverdi, employs, the, concertato, style, with, basso, continuo, a, device, that, was, to, become, a, typical, feature, in, the, emergent, baroque, era, and, includes, a, sinfonia, instrumental, interlude, in, the, final, piece, he, presents, his, music, through, complex, counterpoint, and, daring, harmonies, although, at, times, combining, the, expressive, possibilities, of, the, new, music, with, traditional, polyphony, aquilino, coppini, drew, much, of, the, music, for, his, sacred, contrafacta, of, 1608, from, monteverdi, s, 3rd, 4th, and, 5th, books, of, madrigals, in, writing, to, a, friend, in, 1609, coppini, commented, that, monteverdi, s, pieces, require, during, their, performance, more, flexible, rests, and, bars, that, are, not, strictly, regular, now, pressing, forward, or, abandoning, themselves, to, slowing, down, in, them, there, is, a, truly, wondrous, capacity, for, moving, the, affections, in, monteverdi, s, final, five, years, service, in, mantua, he, completed, the, operas, l, orfeo, 1607, and, l, arianna, 1608, and, wrote, quantities, of, sacred, music, including, the, messa, in, illo, tempore, 1610, and, also, the, collection, known, as, vespro, della, beata, vergine, which, is, often, referred, to, as, monteverdi, s, vespers, 1610, he, also, published, scherzi, musicale, a, tre, voci, 1607, settings, of, verses, composed, since, 1599, and, dedicated, to, the, gonzaga, heir, francesco, the, vocal, trio, in, the, scherzi, comprises, two, sopranos, and, a, bass, accompanied, by, simple, instrumental, ritornellos, according, to, bowers, the, music, reflected, the, modesty, of, the, prince, s, resources, it, was, nevertheless, the, earliest, publication, to, associate, voices, and, instruments, in, this, particular, way, the, opera, opens, with, a, brief, trumpet, toccata, the, prologue, of, la, musica, a, figure, representing, music, is, introduced, with, a, ritornello, by, the, strings, repeated, often, to, represent, the, power, of, music, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, an, operatic, leitmotif, act, 1, presents, a, pastoral, idyll, the, buoyant, mood, of, which, continues, into, act, 2, the, confusion, and, grief, which, follow, the, news, of, euridice, s, death, are, musically, reflected, by, harsh, dissonances, and, the, juxtaposition, of, keys, the, music, remains, in, this, vein, until, the, act, ends, with, the, consoling, sounds, of, the, ritornello, act, 3, is, dominated, by, orfeo, s, aria, possente, spirto, e, formidabil, nume, by, which, he, attempts, to, persuade, caronte, to, allow, him, to, enter, hades, monteverdi, s, vocal, embellishments, and, virtuoso, accompaniment, provide, what, tim, carter, has, described, as, one, of, the, most, compelling, visual, and, aural, representations, in, early, opera, in, act, 4, the, warmth, of, proserpina, s, singing, on, behalf, of, orfeo, is, retained, until, orfeo, fatally, looks, back, the, brief, final, act, which, sees, orfeo, s, rescue, and, metamorphosis, is, framed, by, the, final, appearance, of, the, ritornello, and, by, a, lively, moresca, that, brings, the, audience, back, to, their, everyday, world, throughout, the, opera, monteverdi, makes, innovative, use, of, polyphony, extending, the, rules, beyond, the, conventions, which, composers, normally, observed, in, fidelity, to, palestrina, he, combines, elements, of, the, traditional, 16th, century, madrigal, with, the, new, monodic, style, where, the, text, dominates, the, music, and, sinfonias, and, instrumental, ritornellos, illustrate, the, action, the, music, for, this, opera, is, lost, except, for, the, lamento, d, arianna, which, was, published, in, the, sixth, book, in, 1614, as, a, five, voice, madrigal, a, separate, monodic, version, was, published, in, 1623, in, its, operatic, context, the, lament, depicts, arianna, s, various, emotional, reactions, to, her, abandonment, sorrow, anger, fear, self, pity, desolation, and, a, sense, of, futility, throughout, indignation, and, anger, are, punctuated, by, tenderness, until, a, descending, line, brings, the, piece, to, a, quiet, conclusion, the, musicologist, suzanne, cusick, writes, that, monteverdi, creat, the, lament, as, a, recognizable, genre, of, vocal, chamber, music, and, as, a, standard, scene, in, opera, that, would, become, crucial, almost, genre, defining, to, the, full, scale, public, operas, of, 17th, century, venice, cusick, observes, how, monteverdi, is, able, to, match, in, music, the, rhetorical, and, syntactical, gestures, in, the, text, of, ottavio, rinuccini, the, opening, repeated, words, lasciatemi, morire, let, me, die, are, accompanied, by, a, dominant, seventh, chord, which, ringer, describes, as, an, unforgettable, chromatic, stab, of, pain, ringer, suggests, that, the, lament, defines, monteverdi, s, innovative, creativity, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, in, which, the, prelude, and, the, liebestod, in, tristan, und, isolde, announced, wagner, s, discovery, of, new, expressive, frontiers, rinuccini, s, full, libretto, which, has, survived, was, set, in, modern, times, by, alexander, goehr, arianna, 1995, including, a, version, of, monteverdi, s, lament, the, vespro, della, beata, vergine, monteverdi, s, first, published, sacred, music, since, the, madrigali, spirituali, of, 1583, consists, of, 14, components, an, introductory, versicle, and, response, five, psalms, interspersed, with, five, sacred, concertos, monteverdi, s, term, a, hymn, and, two, magnificat, settings, collectively, these, pieces, fulfil, the, requirements, for, a, vespers, service, on, any, feast, day, of, the, virgin, monteverdi, employs, many, musical, styles, the, more, traditional, features, such, as, cantus, firmus, falsobordone, and, venetian, canzone, are, mixed, with, the, latest, madrigal, style, including, echo, effects, and, chains, of, dissonances, some, of, the, musical, features, used, are, reminiscent, of, l, orfeo, written, slightly, earlier, for, similar, instrumental, and, vocal, forces, in, this, work, the, sacred, concertos, fulfil, the, role, of, the, antiphons, which, divide, the, psalms, in, regular, vespers, services, their, non, liturgical, character, has, led, writers, to, question, whether, they, should, be, within, the, service, or, indeed, whether, this, was, monteverdi, s, intention, in, some, versions, of, monteverdi, s, vespers, for, example, those, of, denis, stevens, the, concertos, are, replaced, with, antiphons, associated, with, the, virgin, although, john, whenham, in, his, analysis, of, the, work, argues, that, the, collection, as, a, whole, should, be, regarded, as, a, single, liturgical, and, artistic, entity, all, the, psalms, and, the, magnificat, are, based, on, melodically, limited, and, repetitious, gregorian, chant, psalm, tones, around, which, monteverdi, builds, a, range, of, innovative, textures, this, concertato, style, challenges, the, traditional, cantus, firmus, and, is, most, evident, in, the, sonata, sopra, sancta, maria, written, for, eight, string, and, wind, instruments, plus, basso, continuo, and, a, single, soprano, voice, monteverdi, uses, modern, rhythms, frequent, metre, changes, and, constantly, varying, textures, yet, according, to, john, eliot, gardiner, for, all, the, virtuosity, of, its, instrumental, writing, and, the, evident, care, which, has, gone, into, the, combinations, of, timbre, monteverdi, s, chief, concern, was, resolving, the, proper, combination, of, words, and, music, the, actual, musical, ingredients, of, the, vespers, were, not, novel, to, mantua, concertato, had, been, used, by, lodovico, grossi, da, viadana, a, former, choirmaster, at, the, cathedral, of, mantua, while, the, sonata, sopra, had, been, anticipated, by, archangelo, crotti, in, his, sancta, maria, published, in, 1608, it, is, writes, denis, arnold, monteverdi, s, mixture, of, the, various, elements, that, makes, the, music, unique, arnold, adds, that, the, vespers, achieved, fame, and, popularity, only, after, their, 20th, century, rediscovery, they, were, not, particularly, regarded, in, monteverdi, s, time, during, his, years, in, venice, monteverdi, published, his, sixth, 1614, seventh, 1619, and, eighth, 1638, books, of, madrigals, the, sixth, book, consists, of, works, written, before, the, composer, s, departure, from, mantua, hans, redlich, sees, it, as, a, transitional, work, containing, monteverdi, s, last, madrigal, compositions, in, the, manner, of, the, prima, pratica, together, with, music, which, is, typical, of, the, new, style, of, expression, which, monteverdi, had, displayed, in, the, dramatic, works, of, 1607, 08, the, central, theme, of, the, collection, is, loss, the, best, known, work, is, the, five, voice, version, of, the, lamento, d, arianna, which, says, massimo, ossi, gives, an, object, lesson, in, the, close, relationship, between, monodic, recitative, and, counterpoint, the, book, contains, monteverdi, s, first, settings, of, verses, by, giambattista, marino, and, two, settings, of, petrarch, which, ossi, considers, the, most, extraordinary, pieces, in, the, volume, providing, some, stunning, musical, moments, while, monteverdi, had, looked, backwards, in, the, sixth, book, he, moved, forward, in, the, seventh, book, from, the, traditional, concept, of, the, madrigal, and, from, monody, in, favour, of, chamber, duets, there, are, exceptions, such, the, two, solo, lettere, amorose, love, letters, se, i, languidi, miei, sguardi, and, se, pur, destina, e, vole, written, to, be, performed, genere, rapresentativo, acted, as, well, as, sung, of, the, duets, which, are, the, main, features, of, the, volume, chew, highlights, ohim, dov, il, mio, ben, dov, il, mio, core, a, romanesca, in, which, two, high, voices, express, dissonances, above, a, repetitive, bass, pattern, the, book, also, contains, large, scale, ensemble, works, and, the, ballet, tirsi, e, clori, this, was, the, height, of, monteverdi, s, marino, period, six, of, the, pieces, in, the, book, are, settings, of, the, poet, s, verses, as, carter, puts, it, monteverdi, embraced, marino, s, madrigalian, kisses, and, love, bites, with, the, enthusiasm, typical, of, the, period, some, commentators, have, opined, that, the, composer, should, have, had, better, poetic, taste, the, eighth, book, subtitled, madrigali, guerrieri, et, amorosi, madrigals, of, war, and, love, is, structured, in, two, symmetrical, halves, one, for, war, and, one, for, love, each, half, begins, with, a, six, voice, setting, followed, by, an, equally, large, scale, petrarch, setting, then, a, series, of, duets, mainly, for, tenor, voices, and, concludes, with, a, theatrical, number, and, a, final, ballet, the, war, half, contains, several, items, written, as, tributes, to, the, emperor, ferdinand, iii, who, had, succeeded, to, the, habsburg, throne, in, 1637, many, of, monteverdi, s, familiar, poets, strozzi, rinuccini, tasso, marino, guarini, are, represented, in, the, settings, it, is, difficult, to, gauge, when, many, of, the, pieces, were, composed, although, the, ballet, mascherata, dell, ingrate, that, ends, the, book, dates, back, to, 1608, and, the, celebration, of, the, gonzaga, savoy, marriage, the, combattimento, di, tancredi, e, clorinda, centrepiece, of, the, war, settings, had, been, written, and, performed, in, venice, in, 1624, on, its, publication, in, the, eighth, book, monteverdi, explicitly, linked, it, to, his, concept, of, concitato, genera, otherwise, stile, concitato, aroused, style, that, would, fittingly, imitate, the, utterance, and, the, accents, of, a, brave, man, who, is, engaged, in, warfare, and, implied, that, since, he, had, originated, this, style, others, had, begun, to, copy, it, the, work, employed, for, the, first, time, instructions, for, the, use, of, pizzicato, string, chords, and, also, evocations, of, fanfares, and, other, sounds, of, combat, the, critic, andrew, clements, describes, the, eighth, book, as, a, statement, of, artistic, principles, and, compositional, authority, in, which, monteverdi, shaped, and, expanded, the, madrigal, form, to, accommodate, what, he, wanted, to, do, the, pieces, collected, in, book, eight, make, up, a, treasury, of, what, music, in, the, first, half, the, 17th, century, could, possibly, express, during, this, period, of, his, venetian, residency, monteverdi, composed, quantities, of, sacred, music, numerous, motets, and, other, short, works, were, included, in, anthologies, by, local, publishers, such, as, giulio, cesare, bianchi, a, former, student, of, monteverdi, and, lorenzo, calvi, and, others, were, published, elsewhere, in, italy, and, austria, the, range, of, styles, in, the, motets, is, broad, from, simple, strophic, arias, with, string, accompaniment, to, full, scale, declamations, with, an, alleluia, finale, monteverdi, retained, emotional, and, political, attachments, to, the, mantuan, court, and, wrote, for, it, or, undertook, to, write, large, amounts, of, stage, music, including, at, least, four, operas, the, ballet, tirsi, e, clori, survives, through, its, inclusion, in, the, seventh, book, but, the, rest, of, the, mantuan, dramatic, music, is, lost, many, of, the, missing, manuscripts, may, have, disappeared, in, the, wars, that, overcame, mantua, in, 1630, the, most, significant, aspect, of, their, loss, according, to, carter, is, the, extent, to, which, they, might, have, provided, musical, links, between, monteverdi, s, early, mantuan, operas, and, those, he, wrote, in, venice, after, 1638, without, these, links, it, is, hard, to, a, produce, a, coherent, account, of, his, development, as, a, composer, for, the, stage, likewise, janet, beat, regrets, that, the, 30, year, gap, hampers, the, study, of, how, opera, orchestration, developed, during, those, critical, early, years, apart, from, the, madrigal, books, monteverdi, s, only, published, collection, during, this, period, was, the, volume, of, scherzi, musicale, in, 1632, for, unknown, reasons, the, composer, s, name, does, not, appear, on, the, inscription, the, dedication, being, signed, by, the, venetian, printer, bartolomeo, magni, carter, surmises, that, the, recently, ordained, monteverdi, may, have, wished, to, keep, his, distance, from, this, secular, collection, it, mixes, strophic, continuo, songs, for, solo, voice, with, more, complex, works, which, employ, continuous, variation, over, repeated, bass, patterns, chew, selects, the, chaconne, for, two, tenors, zefiro, torna, e, di, soavi, accenti, as, the, outstanding, item, in, the, collection, he, greater, part, of, this, piece, consists, of, repetitions, of, a, bass, pattern, which, ensures, tonal, unity, of, a, simple, kind, owing, to, its, being, framed, as, a, simple, cadence, in, a, g, major, tonal, type, over, these, repetitions, inventive, variations, unfold, in, virtuoso, passage, work, main, articles, il, ritorno, d, ulisse, in, patria, l, incoronazione, di, poppea, selva, morale, e, spirituale, the, last, years, of, monteverdi, s, life, were, much, occupied, with, opera, for, the, venetian, stage, richard, taruskin, in, his, oxford, history, of, western, music, gave, his, chapter, on, this, topic, the, title, opera, from, monteverdi, to, monteverdi, this, wording, originally, proposed, humorously, by, the, italian, music, historian, nino, pirrotta, is, interpreted, seriously, by, taruskin, as, indicating, that, monteverdi, is, significantly, responsible, for, the, transformation, of, the, opera, genre, from, a, private, entertainment, of, the, nobility, as, with, orfeo, in, 1607, to, what, became, a, major, commercial, genre, as, exemplified, by, his, opera, l, incoronazione, di, poppea, 1643, his, two, surviving, operatic, works, of, this, period, il, ritorno, d, ulisse, in, patria, and, l, incoronazione, are, held, by, arnold, to, be, the, first, modern, operas, il, ritorno, is, the, first, venetian, opera, to, depart, from, what, ellen, rosand, terms, the, mythological, pastoral, however, david, johnson, in, the, north, american, review, warns, audiences, not, to, expect, immediate, affinity, with, mozart, verdi, or, puccini, you, have, to, submit, yourself, to, a, much, slower, pace, to, a, much, more, chaste, conception, of, melody, to, a, vocal, style, that, is, at, first, merely, like, dry, declamation, and, only, on, repeated, hearings, begins, to, assume, an, extraordinary, eloquence, il, ritorno, says, carter, is, clearly, influenced, by, monteverdi, s, earlier, works, penelope, s, lament, in, act, i, is, close, in, character, to, the, lament, from, l, arianna, while, the, martial, episodes, recall, il, combattimento, stile, concitato, is, prominent, in, the, fight, scenes, and, in, the, slaying, of, penelope, s, suitors, in, l, incoronazione, monteverdi, represents, moods, and, situations, by, specific, musical, devices, triple, metre, stands, for, the, language, of, love, arpeggios, demonstrate, conflict, stile, concitato, represents, rage, there, is, continuing, debate, about, how, much, of, the, extant, l, incoronazione, music, is, monteverdi, s, original, and, how, much, is, the, work, of, others, there, are, for, instance, traces, of, music, by, francesco, cavalli, the, selva, morale, e, spirituale, of, 1641, and, the, posthumous, messa, et, salmi, published, in, 1650, which, was, edited, by, cavalli, are, selections, of, the, sacred, music, that, monteverdi, wrote, for, san, marco, during, his, 30, year, tenure, much, else, was, likely, written, but, not, published, the, selva, morale, volume, opens, with, a, series, of, madrigal, settings, on, moral, texts, dwelling, on, themes, such, as, the, transitory, nature, of, love, earthly, rank, and, achievement, even, existence, itself, they, are, followed, by, a, mass, in, conservative, style, stile, antico, the, high, point, of, which, is, an, extended, seven, voice, gloria, scholars, believe, that, this, might, have, been, written, to, celebrate, the, end, of, the, 1631, plague, the, rest, of, the, volume, is, made, up, of, numerous, psalm, settings, two, magnificats, and, three, salve, reginas, the, messa, et, salmi, volume, includes, a, stile, antico, mass, for, four, voices, a, polyphonic, setting, of, the, psalm, laetatus, sum, and, a, version, of, the, litany, of, lareto, that, monteverdi, had, originally, published, in, 1620, the, posthumous, ninth, book, of, madrigals, was, published, in, 1651, a, miscellany, dating, back, to, the, early, 1630s, some, items, being, repeats, of, previously, published, pieces, such, as, the, popular, duet, o, sia, tranquillo, il, mare, from, 1638, the, book, includes, a, trio, for, three, sopranos, come, dolce, oggi, l, auretta, which, is, the, only, surviving, music, from, the, 1630, lost, opera, proserpina, rapita, in, his, lifetime, monteverdi, enjoyed, considerable, status, among, musicians, and, the, public, this, is, evidenced, by, the, scale, of, his, funeral, rites, ith, truly, royal, pomp, a, catafalque, was, erected, in, the, chiesa, de, padrini, minori, de, frari, decorated, all, in, mourning, but, surrounded, with, so, many, candles, that, the, church, resembled, a, night, sky, luminous, with, stars, this, glorification, was, transitory, carter, writes, that, in, monteverdi, s, day, music, rarely, survived, beyond, the, circumstances, of, its, initial, performance, and, was, quickly, forgotten, along, with, its, creator, in, this, regard, monteverdi, fared, better, than, most, his, operatic, works, were, revived, in, several, cities, in, the, decade, following, his, death, according, to, severo, bonini, writing, in, 1651, every, musical, household, in, italy, possessed, a, copy, of, the, lamento, d, arianna, the, german, composer, heinrich, sch, tz, who, had, studied, in, venice, under, giovanni, gabrieli, shortly, before, monteverdi, s, arrival, there, possessed, a, copy, of, il, combattimento, and, himself, took, up, elements, of, the, stile, concitato, on, his, second, visit, to, venice, in, 1628, 1629, arnold, believes, sch, tz, absorbed, the, concepts, of, basso, continuo, and, expressiveness, of, word, setting, but, he, opines, that, sch, tz, was, more, directly, influenced, by, the, style, of, the, younger, generation, of, venetian, composers, including, grandi, and, giovanni, rovetta, the, eventual, successor, to, monteverdi, at, san, marco, sch, tz, published, a, first, book, of, symphoniae, sacrae, settings, of, biblical, texts, in, the, style, of, seconda, pratica, in, venice, in, 1629, es, steh, gott, auf, from, his, symphoniae, sacrae, ii, published, in, dresden, in, 1647, contains, specific, quotations, from, monteverdi, after, the, 1650s, monteverdi, s, name, quickly, disappears, from, contemporary, accounts, his, music, generally, forgotten, except, for, the, lamento, the, prototype, of, a, genre, that, would, endure, well, into, the, 18th, century, interest, in, monteverdi, revived, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, among, music, scholars, in, germany, and, italy, although, he, was, still, regarded, as, essentially, a, historical, curiosity, wider, interest, in, the, music, itself, began, in, 1881, when, robert, eitner, published, a, shortened, version, of, the, orfeo, score, around, this, time, kurt, vogel, scored, the, madrigals, from, the, original, manuscripts, but, more, critical, interest, was, shown, in, the, operas, following, the, discovery, of, the, l, incoronazione, manuscript, in, 1888, and, that, of, il, ritorno, in, 1904, largely, through, the, efforts, of, vincent, d, indy, all, three, operas, were, staged, in, one, form, or, another, during, the, first, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, l, orfeo, in, may, 1911, l, incoronazione, in, february, 1913, and, il, ritorno, in, may, 1925, the, italian, nationalist, poet, gabriele, d, annunzio, lauded, monteverdi, and, in, his, novel, il, fuoco, 1900, wrote, of, il, divino, claudio, what, a, heroic, soul, purely, italian, in, its, essence, his, vision, of, monteverdi, as, the, true, founder, of, italian, musical, lyricism, was, adopted, by, musicians, who, worked, with, the, regime, of, benito, mussolini, 1922, 1945, including, gian, francesco, malipiero, luigi, dallapiccola, and, mario, labroca, who, contrasted, monteverdi, with, the, decadence, of, the, music, of, richard, strauss, claude, debussy, and, igor, stravinsky, in, the, years, after, the, second, world, war, the, operas, began, to, be, performed, in, the, major, opera, houses, and, eventually, were, established, in, the, general, repertory, the, resuscitation, of, monteverdi, s, sacred, music, took, longer, he, did, not, benefit, from, the, catholic, church, s, 19th, century, revival, of, renaissance, music, in, the, way, that, palestrina, did, perhaps, as, carter, suggests, because, monteverdi, was, viewed, chiefly, as, a, secular, composer, it, was, not, until, 1932, that, the, 1610, vespers, were, published, in, a, modern, edition, followed, by, redlich, s, revision, two, years, later, modern, editions, of, the, selva, morale, and, missa, e, salmi, volumes, were, published, respectively, in, 1940, and, 1942, the, revival, of, public, interest, in, monteverdi, s, music, gathered, pace, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, reaching, full, spate, in, the, general, early, music, revival, of, the, 1970s, during, which, time, the, emphasis, turned, increasingly, towards, authentic, performance, using, historical, instruments, the, magazine, gramophone, notes, over, 30, recordings, of, the, vespers, between, 1976, and, 2011, and, 27, of, il, combattimento, di, tancredi, e, clorinda, between, 1971, and, 2013, monteverdi, s, surviving, operas, are, today, regularly, performed, the, website, operabase, notes, 555, performances, of, the, operas, in, 149, productions, worldwide, in, the, seasons, 2011, 2016, ranking, monteverdi, at, 30th, position, for, all, composers, and, at, 8th, ranking, for, italian, opera, composers, in, 1985, manfred, h, stattkus, published, an, index, to, monteverdi, s, works, the, stattkus, verzeichnis, revised, in, 2006, giving, each, composition, an, sv, number, to, be, used, for, cataloguing, and, references, monteverdi, is, lauded, by, modern, critics, as, the, most, significant, composer, in, late, renaissance, and, early, baroque, italy, one, of, the, principal, composers, in, the, history, of, western, music, and, routinely, as, the, first, great, opera, composer, these, assessments, reflect, a, contemporary, perspective, since, his, music, was, largely, unknown, to, the, composers, who, followed, him, during, an, extensive, period, spanning, more, than, two, centuries, after, his, death, it, is, as, redlich, and, others, have, pointed, out, the, composers, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, who, have, rediscovered, monteverdi, and, sought, to, make, his, music, a, basis, for, their, own, possibly, as, chew, suggests, they, are, attracted, by, monteverdi, s, reputation, as, a, modern, a, breaker, of, rules, against, the, ancients, those, who, deferred, to, ancient, authority, although, the, composer, was, essentially, a, pragmatist, showing, what, can, only, be, described, as, an, opportunistic, and, eclectic, willingness, to, use, whatever, lay, to, hand, for, the, purpose, in, a, letter, dated, 16, october, 1633, monteverdi, appears, to, endorse, the, view, of, himself, as, a, modern, i, would, rather, be, moderately, praised, for, the, new, style, than, greatly, praised, for, the, ordinary, however, chew, in, his, final, summation, sees, the, composer, historically, as, facing, both, ways, willing, to, use, modern, techniques, but, while, at, the, same, time, protective, of, his, status, as, a, competent, composer, in, the, stile, antico, thus, says, chew, his, achievement, was, both, retrospective, and, progressive, monteverdi, represents, the, late, renaissance, era, while, simultaneously, summing, up, much, of, the, early, baroque, and, in, one, respect, in, particular, his, achievement, was, enduring, the, effective, projection, of, human, emotions, in, music, in, a, way, adequate, for, theatre, as, well, as, for, chamber, music
