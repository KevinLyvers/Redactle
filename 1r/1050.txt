and, commander, in, chief, of, greece, for, a, planned, invasion, of, the, achaemenid, empire, of, persia, however, his, assassination, by, a, royal, bodyguard, pausanias, of, orestis, led, to, the,

a, hostage, to, illyria, by, ptolemy, of, aloros, philip, was, later, held, in, thebes, c, 368, 365, bc, which, at, the, time, was, the, leading, city, of, greece, while, in, thebes, philip, received, a, military, and, diplomatic, education, from, epaminondas, and, lived, with, pammenes, who, was, an, enthusiastic, advocate, of, the, sacred, band, of, thebes, in, 364, bc, philip, returned, to, macedon, in, 359, bc, perhaps, in, may, philip, s, other, brother, king, perdiccas, iii, died, in, battle, against, the, illyrians, before, leaving, perdiccas, had, appointed, philip, as, regent, for, his, infant, son, amyntas, iv, but, philip, succeeded, in, taking, the, kingdom, for, himself, philip, s, military, skills, and, expansionist, vision, of, macedonia, brought, him, early, success, he, first, had, to, remedy, the, woes, over, macedonian, territory, faced, by, his, throne, s, government, this, was, a, predicament, that, had, greatly, worsened, through, macedonia, s, defeat, by, the, illyrians, a, struggle, in, which, king, perdiccas, himself, had, died, the, paeonians, and, the, thracians, had, sacked, and, invaded, the, eastern, regions, of, macedonia, while, the, athenians, had, landed, at, methoni, on, the, coast, with, a, contingent, under, the, macedonian, pretender, argaeus, ii, philip, pushed, back, the, paeonians, and, thracians, promising, tributes, and, defeated, the, 3, 000, athenian, hoplites, 359, bc, momentarily, free, from, his, opponents, he, concentrated, on, strengthening, his, internal, position, and, above, all, his, army, philip, ii, made, many, notable, contributions, to, the, macedonian, army, the, cavalry, which, were, the, primary, source, of, the, army, s, strength, went, from, a, force, of, 600, to, 4000, from, the, time, of, the, battles, with, the, illyrians, to, 334, bc, the, discipline, and, training, of, the, soldiers, increased, as, well, and, the, macedonian, soldiers, under, philip, were, provided, with, the, possibility, of, promotion, through, the, ranks, and, rewards, and, bonus, wages, for, exceptional, service, in, addition, to, these, changes, philip, created, the, macedonian, phalanx, an, infantry, formation, that, consisted, of, soldiers, all, armed, with, a, sarissa, philip, is, credited, for, adding, the, sarissa, to, the, macedonian, army, where, it, soon, was, the, common, weapon, used, by, most, soldiers, philip, had, married, audata, daughter, or, granddaughter, of, the, illyrian, king, bardylis, however, this, marriage, did, not, prevent, him, from, marching, against, the, illyrians, in, 358, bc, and, defeating, them, in, a, battle, in, which, some, 7, 000, illyrians, died, 357, bc, by, this, move, philip, established, his, authority, inland, as, far, as, lake, ohrid, and, earned, the, favour, of, the, epirotes, after, securing, the, western, and, southern, borders, of, macedon, philip, went, on, to, besiege, amphipolis, in, 357, bc, the, athenians, had, been, unable, to, conquer, amphipolis, which, commanded, the, gold, mines, of, mount, pangaion, so, philip, reached, an, agreement, with, athens, to, lease, the, city, to, them, after, his, conquest, in, exchange, for, pydna, which, was, lost, by, macedon, in, 363, bc, however, after, conquering, amphipolis, philip, captured, pydna, for, himself, and, kept, both, cities, 357, bc, athens, soon, declared, war, against, him, and, as, a, result, philip, allied, macedon, with, the, chalcidian, league, of, olynthus, he, subsequently, conquered, potidaea, this, time, keeping, his, word, and, ceding, it, to, the, league, in, 356, bc, in, 357, bc, philip, married, the, epirote, princess, olympias, who, was, the, daughter, of, the, king, of, the, molossians, alexander, was, born, in, 356, bc, the, same, year, as, philip, s, racehorse, won, at, the, olympic, games, during, 356, bc, philip, conquered, the, town, of, crenides, and, changed, its, name, to, philippi, he, then, established, a, powerful, garrison, there, to, control, its, mines, which, yielded, much, of, the, gold, he, later, used, for, his, campaigns, in, the, meantime, his, general, parmenion, defeated, the, illyrians, again, in, 355, 354, bc, he, besieged, methone, the, last, city, on, the, thermaic, gulf, controlled, by, athens, during, the, siege, philip, was, injured, in, his, right, eye, which, was, later, removed, surgically, despite, the, arrival, of, two, athenian, fleets, the, city, fell, in, 354, bc, philip, also, attacked, abdera, and, maronea, on, the, thracian, coast, 354, 353, bc, philip, s, involvement, in, the, third, sacred, war, 356, 346, bc, began, in, 354, bc, at, the, request, of, the, thessalian, league, philip, and, his, army, traveled, to, thessaly, in, order, to, capture, pagasae, resulting, in, an, alliance, with, thebes, a, year, later, in, 353, bc, philip, was, once, again, asked, to, assist, in, battle, but, this, time, against, the, tyrant, lycophron, who, was, supported, by, onomarchus, philip, and, his, forces, invaded, thessaly, defeating, 7, 000, phocians, and, forcing, phayllus, the, brother, of, onomarchus, to, leave, that, same, year, onomarchus, and, his, army, defeated, philip, in, two, succeeding, battles, philip, returned, to, thessaly, the, next, summer, this, time, with, an, army, of, 20, 000, infantry, 3, 000, cavalry, and, the, additional, support, of, the, thessalian, league, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, crocus, field, 6, 000, phocians, fell, and, 3, 000, were, taken, as, prisoners, and, later, drowned, this, battle, earned, philip, immense, prestige, as, well, as, the, free, acquisition, of, pherae, he, was, made, the, leader, archon, of, the, thessalian, league, and, was, able, to, claim, magnesia, and, perrhaebia, which, expanded, his, territory, to, pagasae, philip, did, not, attempt, to, advance, into, central, greece, because, the, athenians, unable, to, arrive, in, time, to, defend, pagasae, had, occupied, thermopylae, there, were, no, hostilities, with, athens, yet, but, athens, was, threatened, by, the, macedonians, from, 352, to, 346, bc, philip, did, not, again, travel, south, he, was, active, in, completing, the, subjugation, of, the, balkan, hill, country, to, the, west, and, north, and, in, reducing, the, greek, cities, of, the, coast, as, far, as, the, hebrus, to, the, chief, of, these, coastal, cities, olynthus, philip, continued, to, profess, friendship, until, its, neighboring, cities, were, in, his, hands, in, 348, bc, philip, started, the, siege, of, olynthus, which, apart, from, its, strategic, position, housed, his, half, brothers, arrhidaeus, and, menelaus, pretenders, to, the, macedonian, throne, olynthus, had, at, first, allied, itself, with, philip, but, later, shifted, its, allegiance, to, athens, the, latter, however, did, nothing, to, help, the, city, because, its, expeditions, were, held, back, by, a, revolt, in, euboea, the, macedonian, king, took, olynthus, in, 348, bc, and, razed, the, city, to, the, ground, the, same, fate, was, inflicted, on, other, cities, of, the, chalcidian, peninsula, resulting, in, the, chalcidian, league, dissolving, macedon, and, the, regions, adjoining, it, having, now, been, securely, consolidated, philip, celebrated, his, olympic, games, at, dium, in, 347, bc, philip, advanced, to, the, conquest, of, the, eastern, districts, about, hebrus, and, compelled, the, submission, of, the, thracian, prince, cersobleptes, in, 346, bc, he, intervened, effectively, in, the, war, between, thebes, and, the, phocians, but, his, wars, with, athens, continued, intermittently, however, athens, had, made, overtures, for, peace, and, when, philip, again, moved, south, peace, was, sworn, in, thessaly, with, key, greek, city, states, in, submission, philip, ii, turned, to, sparta, warning, them, if, i, invade, laconia, i, shall, turn, you, out, the, spartans, laconic, reply, was, one, word, if, philip, proceeded, to, invade, laconia, devastate, much, of, it, and, eject, the, spartans, from, various, parts, in, 345, bc, philip, conducted, a, hard, fought, campaign, against, the, ardiaioi, ardiaei, under, their, king, pleuratus, i, during, which, philip, was, seriously, wounded, in, the, lower, right, leg, by, an, ardian, soldier, in, 342, bc, philip, led, a, military, expedition, north, against, the, scythians, conquering, the, thracian, fortified, settlement, eumolpia, to, give, it, his, name, philippopolis, modern, plovdiv, in, 340, bc, philip, started, the, siege, of, perinthus, and, in, 339, bc, began, another, siege, against, the, city, of, byzantium, as, both, sieges, failed, philip, s, influence, over, greece, was, compromised, he, successfully, reasserted, his, authority, in, the, aegean, by, defeating, an, alliance, of, thebans, and, athenians, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, in, 338, bc, and, in, the, same, year, destroyed, amfissa, because, the, residents, had, illegally, cultivated, part, of, the, crisaian, plain, which, belonged, to, delphi, these, decisive, victories, led, to, philip, being, recognized, as, the, military, leader, of, the, league, of, corinth, a, greek, confederation, allied, against, the, persian, empire, in, 338, 7, bc, members, of, the, league, agreed, never, to, wage, war, against, each, other, unless, it, was, to, suppress, revolution, philip, ii, was, involved, quite, early, against, the, achaemenid, empire, from, around, 352, bc, he, supported, several, persian, opponents, to, artaxerxes, iii, such, as, artabazos, ii, amminapes, or, a, persian, nobleman, named, sisines, by, receiving, them, for, several, years, as, exiles, at, the, macedonian, court, this, gave, him, a, good, knowledge, of, persian, issues, and, may, even, have, influenced, some, of, his, innovations, in, the, management, of, the, macedonian, state, alexander, was, also, acquainted, with, these, persian, exiles, during, his, youth, in, 336, bc, philip, ii, sent, parmenion, with, amyntas, andromenes, and, attalus, and, an, army, of, 10, 000, men, into, asia, minor, to, make, preparations, for, an, invasion, to, free, the, greeks, living, on, the, western, coast, and, islands, from, achaemenid, rule, at, first, all, went, well, the, greek, cities, on, the, western, coast, of, anatolia, revolted, until, the, news, arrived, that, philip, had, been, assassinated, and, had, been, succeeded, as, king, by, his, young, son, alexander, the, macedonians, were, demoralized, by, philip, s, death, and, were, subsequently, defeated, near, magnesia, by, the, achaemenids, under, the, command, of, the, mercenary, memnon, of, rhodes, the, kings, of, macedon, practiced, polygamy, philip, ii, had, seven, wives, throughout, his, life, all, members, of, royalty, from, foreign, dynasties, and, all, of, which, were, considered, queens, making, their, children, royalty, as, well, the, dates, of, philip, s, multiple, marriages, and, the, names, of, some, of, his, wives, are, contested, below, is, the, order, of, marriages, king, philip, was, assassinated, in, october, 336, bc, perhaps, 25, october, at, aegae, the, ancient, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, macedon, philip, and, his, royal, court, were, gathered, in, order, to, celebrate, the, marriage, of, alexander, i, of, epirus, and, cleopatra, of, macedon, philip, s, daughter, by, his, fourth, wife, olympias, while, the, king, was, entering, into, the, town, s, theatre, he, was, unprotected, in, order, to, appear, approachable, to, the, greek, diplomats, and, dignitaries, who, were, present, at, that, time, philip, was, suddenly, approached, by, pausanias, of, orestis, one, of, his, seven, bodyguards, and, was, stabbed, in, his, ribs, after, philip, was, killed, the, assassin, immediately, tried, to, escape, and, reach, his, getaway, associates, who, were, waiting, for, him, with, horses, at, the, entrance, to, aegae, the, assassin, was, pursued, by, three, of, philip, s, other, bodyguards, and, during, the, chase, his, horse, accidentally, tripped, on, a, vine, he, was, subsequently, stabbed, to, death, by, the, bodyguards, the, three, sons, of, aeropus, of, lyncestis, were, also, suspected, of, taking, part, in, the, plot, acting, as, accomplices, of, pausanias, arrhabaeus, and, heromenes, were, put, to, death, while, the, third, brother, alexander, of, lyncestis, was, pardoned, the, reasons, for, the, assassination, are, difficult, to, ascertain, there, was, controversy, even, among, ancient, historians, the, only, known, surviving, contemporary, account, is, that, of, aristotle, who, states, simply, that, philip, was, killed, because, pausanias, had, been, offended, by, attalus, philip, s, uncle, in, law, and, his, friends, attalus, was, the, uncle, of, philip, s, wife, cleopatra, renamed, eurydice, upon, marriage, fifty, years, later, the, historian, cleitarchus, expanded, and, embellished, the, story, centuries, afterwards, this, version, was, propagated, by, diodorus, siculus, and, other, historians, who, relied, on, cleitarchus, according, to, the, sixteenth, book, of, diodorus, history, pausanias, of, orestis, had, been, a, lover, of, philip, but, became, jealous, when, philip, turned, his, attention, to, a, younger, man, also, called, pausanias, the, elder, pausanias, taunting, of, the, new, lover, caused, the, younger, pausanias, to, throw, away, his, life, in, battle, which, turned, his, friend, attalus, against, the, elder, pausanias, attalus, took, his, revenge, by, getting, pausanias, of, orestis, drunk, at, a, public, dinner, and, then, raping, him, when, pausanias, complained, to, philip, the, king, felt, unable, to, chastise, attalus, as, he, was, about, to, send, him, to, asia, with, parmenion, to, establish, a, bridgehead, for, an, invasion, he, was, planning, also, philip, had, recently, married, attalus, niece, cleopatra, eurydice, rather, than, offend, attalus, philip, tried, to, mollify, pausanias, by, elevating, him, within, his, personal, bodyguard, pausanias, then, seems, to, have, redirected, his, desire, for, revenge, towards, the, man, who, had, failed, to, avenge, his, damaged, honour, and, accordingly, to, plan, to, kill, philip, some, time, after, the, alleged, rape, while, attalus, was, away, in, asia, fighting, the, persians, he, put, his, plan, into, action, other, historians, e, g, justin, 9, 7, suggested, that, alexander, and, or, his, mother, olympias, were, at, least, privy, to, the, intrigue, if, not, themselves, instigators, olympias, seems, to, have, been, anything, but, discreet, in, manifesting, her, gratitude, to, pausanias, according, to, justin, s, report, he, writes, that, the, same, night, of, her, return, from, exile, she, placed, a, crown, on, the, assassin, s, corpse, and, later, erected, a, tumulus, over, his, grave, and, ordered, that, annual, sacrifices, be, made, to, the, memory, of, pausanias, some, modern, historians, have, claimed, that, none, of, the, accounts, are, probable, they, say, that, in, the, case, of, pausanias, the, purported, motive, for, the, crime, hardly, seems, adequate, furthermore, they, claim, that, implicating, alexander, and, olympias, in, the, plot, seems, specious, to, act, as, they, did, would, have, required, them, to, act, with, an, improbable, degree, of, brazen, effrontery, in, the, face, of, a, military, whose, members, were, personally, loyal, to, philip, what, seems, to, have, been, recorded, rather, are, simply, suspicions, that, were, naturally, directed, towards, the, chief, beneficiaries, of, the, assassination, however, their, actions, in, response, to, the, murder, are, hardly, evidence, of, their, guilt, with, respect, to, the, crime, itself, regardless, of, how, sympathetic, they, might, have, seemed, afterward, scholar, daniel, ogden, has, noted, that, if, there, was, a, sexual, side, to, the, murder, then, it, can, be, contextualized, in, this, regard, against, known, homosexual, relationships, in, and, around, the, macedonian, court, and, that, according, to, aristotle, the, regicide, of, archelaus, i, of, macedon, was, by, his, former, eromenoi, crateuas, and, hellenocrates, of, larissa, whatever, the, actual, background, to, the, assassination, it, may, have, had, an, enormous, effect, on, later, world, events, far, beyond, what, any, conspirators, could, have, predicted, as, asserted, by, some, modern, historians, had, the, older, and, more, settled, philip, been, the, one, in, charge, of, the, war, against, persia, he, might, have, been, content, to, make, relatively, moderate, conquests, e, g, making, anatolia, into, a, macedonian, province, and, unlike, his, son, alexander, not, have, wanted, to, push, further, into, an, overall, conquest, of, persia, and, further, campaigns, in, india, in, 1977, greek, archaeologist, manolis, andronikos, started, excavating, the, great, tumulus, at, aigai, near, modern, vergina, the, capital, and, burial, site, of, the, kings, of, macedon, and, found, that, two, of, the, four, tombs, in, the, tumulus, were, undisturbed, since, antiquity, moreover, these, two, and, particularly, tomb, ii, contained, fabulous, treasures, and, objects, of, great, quality, and, sophistication, although, there, was, much, debate, for, some, years, as, suspected, at, the, time, of, the, discovery, tomb, ii, has, been, shown, to, be, that, of, philip, ii, as, indicated, by, many, features, including, the, greaves, one, of, which, was, shaped, consistently, to, fit, a, leg, with, a, misaligned, tibia, philip, ii, was, recorded, as, having, broken, his, tibia, also, the, remains, of, the, skull, show, damage, to, the, right, eye, caused, by, the, penetration, of, an, object, historically, recorded, to, be, an, arrow, two, scientists, who, studied, some, of, the, bones, claimed, in, 2015, that, philip, was, buried, in, tomb, i, not, tomb, ii, on, the, basis, of, age, knee, ankylosis, and, a, hole, matching, the, penetrating, wound, and, lameness, suffered, by, philip, the, authors, of, the, study, identified, the, remains, of, tomb, i, in, vergina, as, those, of, philip, ii, tomb, ii, instead, was, identified, in, the, study, as, that, of, king, arrhidaeus, and, his, wife, eurydice, ii, the, greek, ministry, of, culture, replied, that, this, claim, was, baseless, and, that, the, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, the, ankylotic, knee, belongs, to, another, body, which, was, thrown, or, put, into, tomb, i, after, this, had, been, looted, and, probably, between, 276, 5, and, 250, bc, besides, this, the, theory, that, tomb, i, belonged, to, philip, ii, had, previously, been, shown, to, be, false, more, recent, research, gives, further, evidence, that, tomb, ii, contains, the, remains, of, philip, ii, the, heroon, at, vergina, in, macedonia, the, ancient, city, of, aegae, is, thought, to, have, been, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, the, family, of, alexander, the, great, and, may, have, housed, the, cult, statue, of, philip, it, is, probable, that, he, was, regarded, as, a, hero, or, deified, on, his, death, though, the, macedonians, did, not, consider, philip, a, god, he, did, receive, other, forms, of, recognition, from, the, greeks, e, g, at, eresos, altar, to, zeus, philippeios, ephesos, his, statue, was, placed, in, the, temple, of, artemis, and, at, olympia, where, the, philippeion, was, built, isocrates, once, wrote, to, philip, that, if, he, defeated, persia, there, would, be, nothing, left, for, him, to, do, but, to, become, a, god, and, demades, proposed, that, philip, be, regarded, as, the, thirteenth, god, however, there, is, no, clear, evidence, that, philip, was, raised, to, the, divine, status, accorded, his, son, alexander, philip, is, mentioned, in, the, opening, verse, of, the, deutero, canonical, first, book, of, maccabees, primary, sources, secondary, sources
