awarded, the, 1934, nobel, prize, in, literature, for, his, bold, and, ingenious, revival, of, dramatic, and, scenic, art, pirandello, s, works, include, novels, hundreds, of, short, stories, and, about, 40, plays, some, of, which, are, written, in, sicilian, pirandello, s, tragic, farces, are, often, seen, as, forerunners, of, the, theatre, of, the, absurd, pirandello, was, born, into, an, upper, class, family, in, girgenti, now, agrigento, sicily, near, the, poor, suburb, of, porto, empedocle, the, area, was, called, caos, from, c, usi, sicilian, for, trousers, after, the, shape, of, a, nearby, ravine, his, father, stefano, pirandello, belonged, to, a, wealthy, family, involved, in, the, sulphur, industry, and, his, mother, caterina, ricci, gramitto, was, also, of, a, well, to, do, background, descending, from, a, family, of, the, bourgeois, professional, class, of, agrigento, both, families, the, pirandellos, and, the, ricci, gramittos, were, ferociously, anti, bourbon, and, actively, participated, in, the, struggle, for, unification, and, democracy, risorgimento, stefano, participated, in, the, famous, expedition, of, the, thousand, later, following, garibaldi, all, the, way, to, the, battle, of, aspromonte, and, caterina, who, had, hardly, reached, the, age, of, thirteen, was, forced, to, accompany, her, father, to, malta, where, he, had, been, sent, into, exile, by, the, bourbon, monarchy, but, the, open, participation, in, the, garibaldian, cause, and, the, strong, sense, of, idealism, of, those, early, years, were, quickly, transformed, above, all, in, caterina, into, an, angry, and, bitter, disappointment, with, the, new, reality, created, by, the, unification, pirandello, would, eventually, assimilate, this, sense, of, betrayal, and, resentment, and, express, it, in, several, of, his, poems, and, in, his, novel, the, old, and, the, young, it, is, also, probable, that, this, climate, of, disillusion, inculcated, in, the, young, luigi, the, sense, of, disproportion, between, ideals, and, reality, which, is, recognizable, in, his, essay, on, humorism, l, umorismo, pirandello, received, his, elementary, education, at, home, but, was, much, more, fascinated, by, the, fables, and, legends, somewhere, between, popular, and, magic, that, his, elderly, servant, maria, stella, used, to, recount, to, him, than, by, anything, scholastic, or, academic, by, the, age, of, twelve, he, had, already, written, his, first, tragedy, at, the, insistence, of, his, father, he, was, registered, at, a, technical, school, but, eventually, switched, to, the, study, of, the, humanities, at, the, ginnasio, something, which, had, always, attracted, him, in, 1880, the, pirandello, family, moved, to, palermo, it, was, here, in, the, capital, of, sicily, that, luigi, completed, his, high, school, education, he, also, began, reading, omnivorously, focusing, above, all, on, 19th, century, italian, poets, such, as, giosu, carducci, and, arturo, graf, he, then, started, writing, his, first, poems, and, fell, in, love, with, his, cousin, lina, during, this, period, the, first, signs, of, serious, differences, arose, between, luigi, and, his, father, luigi, had, discovered, some, notes, revealing, the, existence, of, stefano, s, extramarital, relations, as, a, reaction, to, the, ever, increasing, distrust, and, disharmony, that, luigi, was, developing, toward, his, father, a, man, of, a, robust, physique, and, crude, manners, his, attachment, to, his, mother, would, continue, growing, to, the, point, of, profound, veneration, this, later, expressed, itself, after, her, death, in, the, moving, pages, of, the, novella, colloqui, con, i, personaggi, in, 1915, his, romantic, feelings, for, his, cousin, initially, looked, upon, with, disfavour, were, suddenly, taken, very, seriously, by, lina, s, family, they, demanded, that, luigi, abandon, his, studies, and, dedicate, himself, to, the, sulphur, business, so, that, he, could, immediately, marry, her, in, 1886, during, a, vacation, from, school, luigi, went, to, visit, the, sulphur, mines, of, porto, empedocle, and, started, working, with, his, father, this, experience, was, essential, to, him, and, would, provide, the, basis, for, such, stories, as, il, fumo, ci, ula, scopre, la, luna, as, well, as, some, of, the, descriptions, and, background, in, the, novel, the, old, and, the, young, the, marriage, which, had, seemed, imminent, was, postponed, pirandello, then, registered, at, the, university, of, palermo, in, the, departments, of, law, and, of, letters, the, campus, at, palermo, and, above, all, the, department, of, law, was, the, centre, in, those, years, of, the, vast, movement, which, would, eventually, evolve, into, the, fasci, siciliani, although, pirandello, was, not, an, active, member, of, this, movement, he, had, close, ties, of, friendship, with, its, leading, ideologists, rosario, garibaldi, bosco, enrico, la, loggia, giuseppe, de, felice, giuffrida, and, francesco, de, luca, in, 1887, having, definitively, chosen, the, department, of, letters, he, moved, to, rome, in, order, to, continue, his, studies, but, the, encounter, with, the, city, centre, of, the, struggle, for, unification, to, which, the, families, of, his, parents, had, participated, with, generous, enthusiasm, was, disappointing, and, nothing, close, to, what, he, had, expected, when, i, arrived, in, rome, it, was, raining, hard, it, was, night, time, and, i, felt, like, my, heart, was, being, crushed, but, then, i, laughed, like, a, man, in, the, throes, of, desperation, pirandello, who, was, an, extremely, sensitive, moralist, finally, had, a, chance, to, see, for, himself, the, irreducible, decadence, of, the, so, called, heroes, of, the, risorgimento, in, the, person, of, his, uncle, rocco, now, a, greying, and, exhausted, functionary, of, the, prefecture, who, provided, him, with, temporary, lodgings, in, rome, the, desperate, laugh, the, only, manifestation, of, revenge, for, the, disappointment, undergone, inspired, the, bitter, verses, of, his, first, collection, of, poems, mal, giocondo, 1889, but, not, all, was, negative, this, first, visit, to, rome, provided, him, with, the, opportunity, to, assiduously, visit, the, many, theatres, of, the, capital, il, nazionale, il, valle, il, manzoni, oh, the, dramatic, theatre, i, will, conquer, it, i, cannot, enter, into, one, without, experiencing, a, strange, sensation, an, excitement, of, the, blood, through, all, my, veins, because, of, a, conflict, with, a, latin, professor, he, was, forced, to, leave, the, university, of, rome, and, went, to, bonn, with, a, letter, of, presentation, from, one, of, his, other, professors, the, stay, in, bonn, which, lasted, two, years, was, fervid, with, cultural, life, he, read, the, german, romantics, jean, paul, tieck, chamisso, heinrich, heine, and, goethe, he, began, translating, the, roman, elegies, of, goethe, composed, the, elegie, boreali, in, imitation, of, the, style, of, the, roman, elegies, and, he, began, to, meditate, on, the, topic, of, humorism, by, way, of, the, works, of, cecco, angiolieri, in, march, 1891, he, received, his, doctorate, in, romance, philology, with, a, dissertation, on, the, dialect, of, agrigento, sounds, and, developments, of, sounds, in, the, speech, of, craperallis, after, a, brief, sojourn, in, sicily, during, which, the, planned, marriage, with, his, cousin, was, finally, called, off, he, returned, to, rome, where, he, became, friends, with, a, group, of, writer, journalists, including, ugo, fleres, tomaso, gnoli, giustino, ferri, and, luigi, capuana, capuana, encouraged, pirandello, to, dedicate, himself, to,

san, vincenzo, maria, antonietta, portulano, the, first, years, of, matrimony, brought, on, in, him, a, new, fervour, for, his, studies, and, writings, his, encounters, with, his, friends, and, the, discussions, on, art, continued, more, vivacious, and, stimulating, than, ever, while, his, family, life, despite, the, complete, incomprehension, of, his, wife, with, respect, to, the, artistic, vocation, of, her, husband, proceeded, relatively, tranquilly, with, the, birth, of, two, sons, stefano, and, fausto, and, a, daughter, rosalia, lietta, in, the, meantime, pirandello, intensified, his, collaborations, with, newspaper, editors, and, other, journalists, in, magazines, such, as, la, critica, and, la, tavola, rotonda, in, which, he, published, in, 1895, the, first, part, of, the,

shock, that, her, mental, balance, remained, profoundly, and, irremediably, shaken, pirandello, who, had, initially, harboured, thoughts, of, suicide, attempted, to, remedy, the, situation, as, best, he, could, by, increasing, the, number, of, his, lessons, in, both, italian, and, german, and, asking, for, compensation, from, the, magazines, to, which, he, had, freely, given, away, his, writings,

many, autobiographical, elements, that, have, been, fantastically, re, elaborated, it, was, an, immediate, and, resounding, success, translated, into, german, in, 1905, this, novel, paved, the, way, to, the, notoriety, and, fame, which, allowed, pirandello, to, publish, with, the, more, important, firms, such, as, treves, with, whom, he, published, in, 1906, another, collection, of, novellas,

context, of, playwriting, during, the, early, and, mid, 1900s, pirandello, s, impact, is, notable, pirandello, inspired, playwrights, such, as, samuel, beckett, and, harold, pinter, to, write, plays, that, echo, the, themes, of, existential, exploration, and, metaphysical, questioning, that, he, focused, on, in, his, works, however, his, influence, goes, beyond, playwrights, french, philosopher, jean, paul, sartre, was, also, heavily, inspired, by, pirandello, s, ideas, to, dive, deep, into, one, of, the, main, pillars, of, his, philosophy, existentialism, the, playwright, s, portrayal, of, fractured, identities, and, the, ambiguity, of, existence, in, his, plays, served, as, inspiration, for, sartre, s, concepts, of, freedom, authenticity, and, existential, angst, pirandello, s, character, narratives, and, metaphysical, themes, not, only, aligned, with, but, also, enriched, sartre, s, philosophical, discourses, creating, a, link, between, existential, thought, in, both, theater, and, philosophy, where, each, medium, deepened, and, reflected, upon, the, complexities, and, theories, of, the, other, thus, the, dialogues, between, self, and, other, freedom, and, responsibility, authenticity, and, bad, faith, found, ground, in, the, intersection, of, their, respective, domains, his, legacy, pushes, further, reflection, into, the, complexities, of, characters, human, consciousness, and, identity, pirandello, s, contributions, to, theater, and, philosophy, provide, a, rich, tapestry, of, existential, themes, interwoven, with, detailed, character, narratives, his, thorough, and, insightful, examinations, of, the, intricacies, of, the, human, psyche, and, identity, have, left, a, mark, that, is, palpable, in, contemporary, theater, and, academic, circles, this, influence, while, rooted, in, a, specific, historical, context, manages, to, bridge, the, gap, between, past, and, present, the, careful, juxtaposition, of, simplicity, and, depth, in, his, works, not, only, invites, but, stimulates, discourse, resonating, deeply, with, modern, artists, playwrights, and, thinkers, as, a, result, discussions, on, existential, concepts, identity, and, the, nature, of, reality, continue, to, be, enriched, by, pirandello, s, foundational, ideas, nearly, all, of, pirandello, s, plays, were, translated, into, english, by, the, actor, robert, rietti,
