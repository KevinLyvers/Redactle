which, yielded, the, number, 847, 288, 609, 443, shen, kuo, experimented, with, the, pinhole, camera, and, burning, mirror, as, the, ancient, chinese, mohists, had, done, in, the, 4th, century, bc, as, mozi, of, china, s, warring, states, period, was, perhaps, the, first, to, describe, the, concept, of, camera, obscura, if, not, his, greek, contemporary, aristotle, the, iraqi, muslim, scientist, ibn, al, haytham, 965, 1039, further, experimented, with, camera, obscura, and, was, the, first, to, attribute, geometrical, and, quantitative, properties, to, it, but, shen, was, first, to, note, the, relationship, of, the, three, separate, radiation, phenomena, the, focal, point, burning, point, and, pinhole, using, a, fitting, metaphor, shen, compared, optical, image, inversion, to, an, oarlock, and, waisted, drum, along, with, focal, points, he, also, noted, that, the, image, in, a, concave, mirror, is, inverted, shen, who, never, asserted, that, he, was, the, first, to, experiment, with, camera, obscura, hints, in, his, writing, that, camera, obscura, was, dealt, with, in, the, miscellaneous, morsels, from, youyang, written, by, duan, chengshi, d, 863, during, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, in, regard, to, the, inverted, image, of, a, chinese, pagoda, by, a, seashore, chinese, authors, from, the, 12th, to, 17th, centuries, would, discuss, the, optical, observations, made, by, shen, kuo, but, not, advance, them, further, while, leonardo, da, vinci, 1452, 1519, would, be, the, first, in, europe, to, make, a, similar, observation, about, the, focal, point, and, pinhole, in, camera, obscura, since, the, time, of, the, engineer, and, inventor, ma, jun, c, 200, 265, the, chinese, had, used, the, south, pointing, chariot, which, did, not, employ, magnetism, as, a, compass, in, 1044, the, collection, of, the, most, important, military, techniques, wujing, zongyao, recorded, that, fish, shaped, objects, cut, from, sheet, iron, magnetized, by, thermoremanence, essentially, heating, that, produced, weak, magnetic, force, and, placed, in, a, water, filled, bowl, enclosed, by, a, box, were, used, for, directional, pathfinding, alongside, the, south, pointing, chariot, however, it, was, not, until, the, time, of, shen, kuo, that, the, earliest, magnetic, compasses, would, be, used, for, navigation, in, his, written, work, shen, kuo, made, the, first, known, explicit, reference, to, the, magnetic, compass, needle, and, the, concept, of, true, north, he, wrote, that, steel, needles, were, magnetized, once, they, were, rubbed, with, lodestone, and, that, they, were, put, in, floating, position, or, in, mountings, he, described, the, suspended, compass, as, the, best, form, to, be, used, and, noted, that, the, magnetic, needle, of, compasses, pointed, either, south, or, north, shen, kuo, asserted, that, the, needle, will, point, south, but, with, a, deviation, stating, are, always, displaced, slightly, east, rather, than, pointing, due, south, shen, kuo, wrote, that, it, was, preferable, to, use, the, twenty, four, point, rose, instead, of, the, old, eight, compass, cardinal, points, and, the, former, was, recorded, in, use, for, navigation, shortly, after, shen, s, death, the, preference, of, use, for, the, twenty, four, point, rose, compass, may, have, arisen, from, shen, s, finding, of, a, more, accurate, astronomical, meridian, determined, by, his, measurement, between, the, pole, star, and, true, north, however, it, could, also, have, been, inspired, by, geomantic, beliefs, and, practices, the, book, of, the, author, zhu, yu, the, pingzhou, table, talks, published, in, 1119, written, from, 1111, to, 1117, was, the, first, record, of, use, of, a, compass, for, seafaring, navigation, however, zhu, yu, s, book, recounts, events, back, to, 1086, when, shen, kuo, was, writing, the, dream, pool, essays, this, meant, that, in, shen, s, time, the, compass, might, have, already, been, in, navigational, use, in, any, case, shen, kuo, s, writing, on, magnetic, compasses, has, proved, invaluable, for, understanding, china, s, earliest, use, of, the, compass, for, seafaring, navigation, many, of, shen, kuo, s, contemporaries, were, interested, in, antiquarian, pursuits, of, collecting, old, artworks, they, were, also, interested, in, archaeological, pursuits, although, for, rather, different, reasons, than, why, shen, kuo, held, an, interest, in, archaeology, while, shen, s, educated, confucian, contemporaries, were, interested, in, obtaining, ancient, relics, and, antiques, in, order, to, revive, their, use, in, rituals, shen, was, more, concerned, with, how, items, from, archeological, finds, were, originally, manufactured, and, what, their, functionality, would, have, been, based, on, empirical, evidence, shen, kuo, criticized, those, in, his, day, who, reconstructed, ancient, ritual, objects, using, only, their, imagination, and, not, the, tangible, evidence, from, archeological, digs, or, finds, shen, also, disdained, the, notion, of, others, that, these, objects, were, products, of, the, sages, or, the, aristocratic, class, of, antiquity, rightfully, crediting, the, items, manufacture, and, production, to, the, common, working, people, and, artisans, of, previous, eras, some, author, writes, that, shen, kuo, advocated, the, use, of, an, interdisciplinary, approach, to, archaeology, and, practiced, such, an, approach, himself, through, his, work, in, metallurgy, optics, and, geometry, in, the, study, of, ancient, measures, while, working, in, the, bureau, of, astronomy, shen, kuo, s, interest, in, archaeology, and, old, relics, led, him, to, reconstruct, an, armillary, sphere, from, existing, models, as, well, as, from, ancient, texts, that, could, provide, additional, information, shen, used, ancient, mirrors, while, conducting, his, optics, experiments, he, observed, ancient, weaponry, describing, the, scaled, sight, devices, on, ancient, crossbows, and, the, ancients, production, of, swords, with, composite, blades, that, had, a, midrib, of, wrought, iron, and, low, carbon, steel, while, having, two, sharp, edges, of, high, carbon, steel, being, a, knowledgeable, musician, shen, also, suggested, suspending, an, ancient, bell, by, using, a, hollow, handle, in, his, assessment, of, the, carved, reliefs, of, the, ancient, zhuwei, tomb, shen, stated, that, the, reliefs, demonstrate, genuine, han, dynasty, era, clothing, after, unearthing, an, ancient, crossbow, device, from, a, house, s, garden, in, haichow, jiangsu, shen, discovered, that, the, cross, wire, grid, sighting, device, marked, in, graduated, measurements, on, the, stock, could, be, used, to, calculate, the, height, of, a, distant, mountain, in, the, same, way, that, mathematicians, could, apply, right, angle, triangles, to, measure, height, needham, asserts, shen, had, discovered, the, survey, device, known, as, jacob, s, staff, which, was, not, described, elsewhere, until, the, proven, al, jewish, mathematician, levi, ben, gerson, 1288, 1344, wrote, of, it, in, 1321, shen, wrote, that, while, viewing, the, whole, of, a, mountain, the, distance, on, the, instrument, was, long, but, while, viewing, a, small, part, of, the, mountainside, the, distance, was, short, due, to, the, device, s, cross, piece, that, had, to, be, pushed, further, away, from, the, observer, s, eye, with, the, graduation, starting, on, the, further, end, he, wrote, that, if, one, placed, an, arrow, on, the, device, and, looked, past, its, end, the, degree, of, the, mountain, could, be, measured, and, thus, its, height, could, be, calculated, the, ancient, greek, aristotle, 384, bc, 322, bc, wrote, in, his, meteorology, of, how, the, earth, had, the, potential, for, physical, change, including, the, belief, that, all, rivers, and, seas, at, one, time, did, not, exist, where, they, were, and, were, dry, the, greek, writer, xenophanes, 570, bc, 480, bc, wrote, of, how, inland, marine, fossils, were, evidence, that, massive, periodic, flooding, had, wiped, out, mankind, several, times, in, the, past, but, never, wrote, of, land, formation, or, shifting, seashores, du, yu, 222, 285, a, chinese, jin, dynasty, officer, believed, that, the, land, of, hills, would, eventually, be, leveled, into, valleys, and, valleys, would, gradually, rise, to, form, hills, the, daoist, alchemist, ge, hong, 284, 364, wrote, of, the, legendary, immortal, magu, in, a, written, dialogue, by, ge, ma, gu, described, how, what, was, once, the, eastern, sea, i, e, east, china, sea, had, transformed, into, solid, land, where, mulberry, trees, grew, and, would, one, day, be, filled, with, mountains, and, dry, dusty, lands, the, later, persian, muslim, scholar, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, 973, 1048, hypothesized, that, india, was, once, covered, by, the, indian, ocean, while, observing, rock, formations, at, the, mouths, of, rivers, it, was, shen, kuo, who, formulated, a, hypothesis, about, the, process, of, land, formation, geomorphology, based, upon, several, observations, as, evidence, this, included, his, observation, of, fossil, shells, in, a, geological, stratum, of, a, mountain, hundreds, of, miles, from, the, ocean, he, inferred, that, the, land, was, reshaped, and, formed, by, erosion, of, the, mountains, uplift, and, the, deposition, of, silt, after, observing, strange, natural, erosions, of, the, taihang, mountains, and, the, yandang, mountain, near, wenzhou, he, hypothesized, that, with, the, inundation, of, silt, the, land, of, the, continent, must, have, been, formed, over, an, enormous, span, of, time, while, visiting, the, taihang, mountains, in, 1074, shen, kuo, noticed, strata, of, bivalve, shells, and, ovoid, rocks, in, a, horizontal, running, span, through, a, cliff, like, a, large, belt, shen, proposed, that, the, cliff, was, once, the, location, of, an, ancient, seashore, that, by, his, time, had, shifted, hundreds, of, miles, east, shen, wrote, that, in, the, zhiping, reign, period, 1064, 1067, a, man, of, zezhou, unearthed, an, object, in, his, garden, that, looked, like, a, serpent, or, dragon, and, after, examining, it, concluded, the, dead, animal, had, apparently, turned, to, stone, the, magistrate, of, jincheng, zheng, boshun, examined, the, creature, as, well, and, noted, the, same, scale, like, markings, that, were, seen, on, other, marine, animals, shen, kuo, likened, this, to, the, stone, crabs, found, in, china, shen, also, wrote, that, since, petrified, bamboos, were, found, underground, in, a, climatic, area, where, they, had, never, been, known, to, be, grown, the, climate, there, must, have, shifted, geographically, over, time, around, the, year, 1080, shen, kuo, noted, that, a, landslide, on, the, bank, of, a, large, river, near, yanzhou, modern, yan, an, had, revealed, an, open, space, several, dozens, of, feet, under, the, ground, once, the, bank, collapsed, this, underground, space, contained, hundreds, of, petrified, bamboos, still, intact, with, roots, and, trunks, all, turned, to, stone, as, shen, kuo, wrote, shen, kuo, noted, that, bamboos, do, not, grow, in, yanzhou, located, in, northern, china, and, he, was, puzzled, during, which, previous, dynasty, the, bamboos, could, have, grown, considering, that, damp, and, gloomy, low, places, provide, suitable, conditions, for, the, growth, of, bamboo, shen, deduced, that, the, climate, of, yanzhou, must, have, fit, that, description, in, very, ancient, times, although, this, would, have, intrigued, many, of, his, readers, the, study, of, paleoclimatology, in, medieval, china, did, not, develop, into, an, established, discipline, the, song, dynasty, philosopher, zhu, xi, 1130, 1200, wrote, of, this, curious, natural, phenomenon, of, fossils, as, well, he, was, known, to, have, read, the, works, of, shen, kuo, shen, s, description, of, soil, erosion, and, weathering, predated, that, of, georgius, agricola, in, his, book, of, 1546, de, veteribus, et, novis, metallis, furthermore, shen, s, theory, of, sedimentary, deposition, predated, that, of, james, hutton, whose, groundbreaking, work, was, published, in, 1802, considered, the, foundation, of, modern, geology, historian, joseph, needham, likened, shen, s, account, to, that, of, the, scottish, scientist, roderick, murchison, 1792, 1871, who, was, inspired, to, become, a, geologist, after, observing, a, providential, landslide, early, speculation, and, hypothesis, pertaining, to, what, is, now, known, as, meteorology, had, a, long, tradition, in, china, before, shen, kuo, for, example, the, han, dynasty, scholar, wang, chong, 27, 97, accurately, described, the, process, of, the, water, cycle, however, shen, made, some, observations, that, were, not, found, elsewhere, in, chinese, literature, for, instance, shen, was, the, first, in, east, asia, to, describe, tornadoes, which, were, thought, to, exist, only, in, the, western, hemisphere, until, their, observation, in, china, during, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, shen, gave, reasoning, earlier, proposed, by, sun, sikong, 1015, 1076, that, rainbows, were, formed, by, the, shadow, of, the, sun, in, rain, occurring, when, the, sun, would, shine, upon, it, paul, dong, writes, that, shen, s, explanation, of, the, rainbow, as, a, phenomenon, of, atmospheric, refraction, is, basically, in, accord, with, modern, scientific, principles, in, europe, roger, bacon, 1214, 1294, was, the, first, to, suggest, that, the, colors, of, the, rainbow, were, caused, by, the, reflection, and, refraction, of, sunlight, through, rain, drops, shen, hypothesized, that, rays, of, sunlight, refract, before, reaching, the, surface, of, the, earth, hence, people, on, earth, observing, the, sun, are, not, viewing, it, in, its, exact, position, in, other, words, the, altitude, of, the, apparent, sun, is, higher, than, the, actual, altitude, of, the, sun, dong, writes, that, at, the, time, this, discovery, was, remarkably, original, ibn, al, haytham, in, his, book, of, optics, 1021, also, discussed, atmospheric, refraction, in, regard, to, twilight, being, the, head, official, for, the, bureau, of, astronomy, shen, kuo, was, an, avid, scholar, of, medieval, astronomy, and, improved, the, designs, of, several, astronomical, instruments, shen, is, credited, with, making, improved, designs, of, the, gnomon, armillary, sphere, and, clepsydra, clock, for, the, clepsydra, he, designed, a, new, overflow, tank, type, and, argued, for, a, more, efficient, higher, order, interpolation, instead, of, linear, interpolation, in, calibrating, the, measure, of, time, improving, the, 5th, century, model, of, the, astronomical, sighting, tube, shen, kuo, widened, its, diameter, so, that, the, new, calibration, could, observe, the, pole, star, indefinitely, this, came, about, due, to, the, position, of, the, pole, star, shifting, in, position, since, the, time, of, zu, geng, in, the, 5th, century, hence, shen, kuo, diligently, observed, the, course, of, the, pole, star, for, three, months, plotting, the, data, of, its, course, and, coming, to, the, conclusion, that, it, had, shifted, slightly, over, three, degrees, apparently, this, astronomical, finding, had, an, impact, upon, the, intellectual, community, in, china, at, the, time, even, shen, s, political, rival, and, contemporary, astronomer, su, song, featured, shen, s, corrected, position, of, the, pole, star, halfway, between, tian, shu, at, 350, degrees, and, the, current, polaris, in, the, fourth, star, map, of, his, celestial, atlas, the, astronomical, phenomena, of, the, solar, eclipse, and, lunar, eclipse, had, been, observed, in, the, 4th, century, bc, by, astronomers, gan, de, and, shi, shen, the, latter, gave, instructions, on, predicting, the, eclipses, based, on, the, relative, position, of, the, moon, to, the, sun, the, philosopher, wang, chong, argued, against, the, radiating, influence, theory, of, jing, fang, s, writing, in, the, 1st, century, bc, and, that, of, zhang, heng, 78, 139, the, latter, two, correctly, hypothesized, that, the, brightness, of, the, moon, was, merely, light, reflected, from, the, sun, jing, fang, had, written, in, the, 1st, century, bc, of, how, it, was, long, accepted, in, china, that, the, sun, and, moon, were, spherical, in, shape, like, a, crossbow, bullet, not, flat, shen, kuo, also, wrote, of, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, in, this, manner, yet, expanded, upon, this, to, explain, why, the, celestial, bodies, were, spherical, going, against, the, flat, earth, theory, for, celestial, bodies, however, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, shen, kuo, supported, a, round, earth, theory, which, was, introduced, into, chinese, science, by, matteo, ricci, and, xu, guangqi, in, the, 17th, century, when, the, director, of, the, astronomical, observatory, asked, shen, kuo, if, the, shapes, of, the, sun, and, moon, were, round, like, balls, or, flat, like, fans, shen, kuo, explained, that, celestial, bodies, were, spherical, because, of, knowledge, of, waxing, and, waning, of, the, moon, much, like, what, zhang, heng, had, said, shen, kuo, likened, the, moon, to, a, ball, of, silver, which, does, not, produce, light, but, simply, reflects, light, if, provided, from, another, source, the, sun, he, explained, that, when, the, sun, s, light, is, slanting, the, moon, appears, full, he, then, explained, if, one, were, to, cover, any, sort, of, sphere, with, white, powder, and, then, viewed, from, the, side, it, would, appear, to, be, a, crescent, hence, he, reasoned, that, celestial, bodies, were, spherical, he, also, wrote, that, although, the, sun, and, moon, were, in, conjunction, and, opposition, with, each, other, once, a, month, this, did, not, mean, the, sun, would, be, eclipsed, every, time, their, paths, met, because, of, the, small, obliquity, of, their, orbital, paths, shen, is, also, known, for, his, cosmological, hypotheses, in, explaining, the, variations, of, planetary, motions, including, retrogradation, his, colleague, wei, pu, realized, that, the, old, calculation, technique, for, the, mean, sun, was, inaccurate, compared, to, the, apparent, sun, since, the, latter, was, ahead, of, it, in, the, accelerated, phase, of, motion, and, behind, it, in, the, retarded, phase, shen, s, hypotheses, were, similar, to, the, concept, of, the, epicycle, in, the, greco, roman, tradition, only, shen, compared, the, side, section, of, orbital, paths, of, planets, and, variations, of, planetary, speeds, to, points, in, the, tips, of, a, willow, leaf, in, a, similar, rudimentary, physical, analogy, of, celestial, motions, as, john, b, henderson, describes, it, shen, likened, the, relationship, of, the, moon, s, path, to, the, ecliptic, the, path, of, the, sun, to, the, figure, of, a, rope, coiled, about, a, tree, along, with, his, colleague, wei, pu, in, the, bureau, of, astronomy, shen, kuo, planned, to, plot, out, the, exact, coordinates, of, planetary, and, lunar, movements, by, recording, their, astronomical, observations, three, times, a, night, for, a, continuum, of, five, years, the, song, astronomers, of, shen, s, day, still, retained, the, lunar, theory, and, coordinates, of, the, earlier, yi, xing, which, after, 350, years, had, devolved, into, a, state, of, considerable, error, shen, criticized, earlier, chinese, astronomers, for, failing, to, describe, celestial, movement, in, spatial, terms, yet, he, did, not, attempt, to, provide, any, reasoning, for, the, motive, power, of, the, planets, or, other, celestial, movements, shen, and, wei, began, astronomical, observations, for, the, moon, and, planets, by, plotting, their, locations, three, times, a, night, for, what, should, have, been, five, successive, years, the, officials, and, astronomers, at, court, were, deeply, opposed, to, wei, and, shen, s, work, offended, by, their, insistence, that, the, coordinates, of, the, renowned, yi, xing, were, inaccurate, they, also, slandered, wei, pu, out, of, resentment, that, a, commoner, had, expertise, exceeding, theirs, when, wei, and, shen, made, a, public, demonstration, using, the, gnomon, to, prove, the, doubtful, wrong, the, other, ministers, reluctantly, agreed, to, correct, the, lunar, and, solar, errors, despite, this, success, they, eventually, dismissed, wei, and, shen, s, tables, of, planetary, motions, therefore, only, the, worst, and, most, obvious, planetary, errors, were, corrected, and, many, inaccuracies, remained, shen, kuo, wrote, that, during, the, qingli, reign, period, 1041, 1048, under, emperor, renzong, of, song, 1022, 1063, an, obscure, commoner, and, artisan, known, as, bi, sheng, 990, 1051, invented, ceramic, movable, type, printing, although, the, use, of, assembling, individual, characters, to, compose, a, piece, of, text, had, its, origins, in, antiquity, bi, sheng, s, methodical, innovation, was, something, completely, revolutionary, for, his, time, shen, kuo, noted, that, the, process, was, tedious, if, one, only, wanted, to, print, a, few, copies, of, a, book, but, if, one, desired, to, make, hundreds, or, thousands, of, copies, the, process, was, incredibly, fast, and, efficient, beyond, shen, kuo, s, writing, however, nothing, is, known, of, bi, sheng, s, life, or, the, influence, of, movable, type, in, his, lifetime, although, the, details, of, bi, sheng, s, life, were, scarcely, known, shen, kuo, wrote, when, bi, sheng, died, his, fount, of, type, passed, into, the, possession, of, my, followers, i, e, one, of, shen, s, nephews, among, whom, it, has, been, kept, as, a, precious, possession, until, now, there, are, a, few, surviving, examples, of, books, printed, in, the, late, song, dynasty, using, movable, type, printing, this, includes, zhou, bida, s, notes, of, the, jade, hall, printed, in, 1193, using, the, method, of, baked, clay, movable, type, characters, outlined, in, the, dream, pool, essays, yao, shu, 1201, 1278, an, advisor, to, kublai, khan, once, persuaded, a, disciple, yang, gu, to, print, philological, primers, and, neo, confucian, texts, by, using, what, he, termed, the, movable, type, of, shen, kuo, wang, zhen, fl, 1290, 1333, who, wrote, the, valuable, agricultural, scientific, and, technological, treatise, of, the, nong, shu, mentioned, an, alternative, method, of, baking, earthenware, type, with, earthenware, frames, in, order, to, make, whole, blocks, wang, zhen, also, improved, its, use, by, inventing, wooden, movable, type, in, the, years, 1297, or, 1298, while, he, was, a, magistrate, of, jingde, anhui, province, the, earlier, bi, sheng, had, experimented, with, wooden, movable, type, but, wang, s, main, contribution, was, improving, the, speed, of, typesetting, with, simple, mechanical, devices, along, with, the, complex, systematic, arrangement, of, wooden, movable, type, involving, the, use, of, revolving, tables, although, later, metal, movable, type, would, be, used, in, china, wang, zhen, experimented, with, tin, metal, movable, type, but, found, its, use, to, be, inefficient, by, the, 15th, century, metal, movable, type, printing, was, developed, in, ming, dynasty, china, and, earlier, in, goryeo, korea, by, the, mid, 13th, century, and, was, widely, applied, in, china, by, at, least, the, 16th, century, in, jiangsu, and, fujian, wealthy, ming, era, families, sponsored, the, use, of, metal, type, printing, mostly, using, bronze, this, included, the, printing, works, of, hua, sui, 1439, 1513, who, pioneered, the, first, chinese, bronze, type, movable, printing, in, the, year, 1490, in, 1718, during, the, mid, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1912, the, scholar, of, tai, an, known, as, xu, zhiding, developed, movable, type, with, enamelware, instead, of, earthenware, there, was, also, zhai, jinsheng, b, 1784, a, teacher, of, jingxian, anhui, who, spent, thirty, years, making, a, font, of, earthenware, movable, type, and, by, 1844, he, had, over, 100, 000, chinese, writing, characters, in, five, sizes, despite, these, advances, movable, type, printing, never, gained, the, amount, of, widespread, use, in, east, asia, that, woodblock, printing, had, achieved, since, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, in, the, 9th, century, with, written, chinese, the, vast, amount, of, written, morpheme, characters, impeded, movable, type, s, acceptance, and, practical, use, and, was, therefore, seen, as, largely, unsatisfactory, furthermore, the, european, printing, press, first, invented, by, johannes, gutenberg, 1398, 1468, was, eventually, wholly, adopted, as, the,
