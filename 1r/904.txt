indian, yogacara, metaphysics, of, appearance, only, vij, apti, m, tra, which, has, been, described, as, a, form, of, epistemological, idealism, phenomenology, and, close, to, immanuel, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, apart, from, this, he, wrote, several, commentaries, works, on, logic, argumentation, and, devotional, poetry, vasubandhu, is, one, of, the, most, influential, thinkers, in, the, indian, buddhist, philosophical, tradition, because, of, their, association, with, nalanda, university, vasubandhu, and, asanga, are, amongst, the, so, called, seventeen, nalanda, masters, in, j,

initially, studied, with, the, buddhist, sarv, stiv, da, also, called, vaibh, ika, who, upheld, the, mahavibhasa, commentary, school, which, was, dominant, in, gandhara, and, later, moved, to, kashmir, to, study, with, the, heads, of, the, orthodox, sarvastivada, branch, there, after, returning, home, he, lectured, on, abhidharma, and, composed, the, abhidharmako, ak, rik, verses, on, the, treasury, of, the, abhidharma, a, verse, distillation, of, sarvastivada, abhidharma, teachings, which, was, an, analysis, of, all, factors, of, experience, into, its, constituent, dharmas, phenomenal, events, however, vasubandhu, had, also, begun, to, question, sarv, stiv, da, vaibh, ika, view, for, some, time, and, had, studied, with, the, sautr, ntika, teacher, manoratha, thus, his, auto, commentary, to, his, abhidharma, verses, sometimes, criticize, the, vaibh, ika, system, from, a, sautr, ntika, viewpoint, however, the, work, is, not, always, critical, of, vaibh, ika, and, in, some, cases, it, also, defends, the, orthodox, vaibhasika, position, the, abhidharmako, a, remains, the, main, source, for, abhidharma, studies, in, both, tibetan, buddhism, and, east, asian, buddhism, vasubandhu, is, later, said, to, have, converted, to, mahayana, beliefs, under, the, influence, of, his, brother, asanga, whereupon, he, composed, a, number, of, yogacara, treatises, and, mahayana, sutra, commentaries, some, of, his, most, influential, mahayana, works, have, been, the, twenty, verses, on, consciousness, only, vim, atik, vij, aptim, trat, siddhi, with, its, commentary, vi, atik, v, tti, the, thirty, verses, on, consciousness, only, tri, ik, vij, aptim, trat, and, his, discourse, on, the, pure, land, j, ngt, l, n, the, thirty, verses, is, the, basis, for, xuanzang, s, cheng, wei, shi, lun, one, of, the, most, important, sources, in, east, asian, yogacara, buddhism, his, pure, land, treatise, was, also, very, influential, on, east, asian, pure, land, buddhism, in, india, vasubandhu, became, known, as, a, major, mahayana, master, scholar, and, debater, he, is, reported, to, have, defeated, samkhya, philosophers, in, debate, in, front, of, the, gupta, king, vikramaditya, variously, identified, as, chandragupta, ii, or, skandagupta, at, ayodhya, who, is, said, to, have, rewarded, him, with, 300, 000, pieces, of, gold, vasubandhu, used, the, money, he, made, from, royal, patronage, and, debating, victories, to, build, buddhist, monasteries, and, hospitals, as, per, traditional, accounts, vasubandhu, died, while, visiting, nepal, at, the, age, of, 100, vasubandhu, was, prolific, author, of, buddhist, treatises, and, commentaries, a, list, of, his, key, works, includes, erich, frauwallner, a, mid, 20th, century, buddhologist, sought, to, distinguish, two, vasubandhus, one, the, yog, c, rin, and, the, other, a, sautr, ntika, but, this, view, has, largely, fallen, from, favour, in, part, on, the, basis, of, the, anonymous, abhidharma, d, pa, a, critique, of, the, abhidharmako, ak, rik, which, clearly, identifies, vasubandhu, as, the, sole, author, of, both, groups, of, writings, according, to, dan, lusthaus, since, the, progression, and, development, of, his, thought, is, so, strikingly, evident, in, these, works, and, the, similarity, of, vocabulary, and, style, of, argument, so, apparent, across, the, texts, the, theory, of, two, vasubandhus, has, little, merit, scholarly, consensus, on, this, question, has, generally, moved, away, from, frauwallner, s, two, authors, position, confucianism, persons, topics,

of, perception, causal, theories, the, causes, and, elimination, of, moral, problems, the, theory, of, rebirth, and, the, qualities, of, a, buddha, the, treasury, and, its, commentary, also, expound, all, kinds, of, arguments, relating, to, the, sarvastivada, abhidharma, and, critique, those, arguments, from, a, sautantrika, perspective, in, the, commentary, major, arguments, include, an, extensive, critique, of, the, self, atman, and, pudgala, and, a, critique, of, the, sarvastivada, theory, of, the, existence, of, the, dharmas, of, the, three, time, periods, in, the, treasury, vasubadhu, also, argued, against, a, creator, god, ishvara, and, against, the, sarvastivada, theory, of, avij, aptir, pa, unperceived, physicality, or, invisible, physicality, vasubandhu, s, critique, of, the, self, is, a, defence, of, buddhist, anatman, doctrine, and, also, a, critique, of, the, buddhist, personalist, school, and, hindu, view, of, the, soul, it, is, intended, to, show, the, unreality, of, the, self, or, person, as, over, and, above, the, five, skandhas, heaps, aggregates, which, make, up, an, individual, vasubandhu, begins, by, outlining, the, soteriological, motive, for, his, argument, writing, that, any, view, which, sees, the, self, as, having, independent, reality, e, g, the, hindu, view, is, not, conducive, to, nirvana, vasubandhu, then, evaluates, the, idea, of, the, self, from, epistemic, grounds, pramana, vasubandhu, states, that, what, is, real, can, only, be, known, from, perception, pratyak, a, or, inference, anum, a, perception, allows, one, to, observe, directly, the, objects, of, the, six, sense, spheres, inference, allows, one, to, infer, the, existence, of, sense, organs, however, there, is, no, such, inference, for, a, solid, real, self, apart, from, the, stream, of, constantly, changing, sense, perceptions, and, mental, activity, of, the, sense, spheres, vasubandhu, also, argues, that, because, the, self, is, not, causally, efficient, it, is, mere, convention, praj, apti, and, a, conceptual, construction, parikalpita, this, argument, is, mainly, against, the, buddhist, pudgalavada, school, who, held, a, view, of, a, person, that, was, dependent, on, the, five, aggregates, yet, was, also, distinct, in, order, to, account, for, the, continuity, of, personality, vasubandhu, sees, this, as, illogical, for, him, the, self, is, made, up, of, constantly, changing, sensory, organs, sense, impressions, ideas, and, mental, processes, any, imagined, unity, of, self, hood, is, a, false, projection, vasubandhu, also, uses, this, analysis, of, the, stream, of, consciousness, to, attack, non, buddhist, hindu, views, of, the, atman, vasubandhu, shows, that, the, hindu, view, of, the, self, as, controller, is, refuted, by, an, analysis, of, the, flux, and, disorder, of, mental, events, and, the, inability, of, the, supposed, self, to, control, our, minds, and, thoughts, in, any, way, we, would, like, if, the, self, is, truly, an, eternal, un, caused, agent, it, should, be, unaffected, by, mere, physical, and, mental, causes, and, it, also, seems, difficult, to, explain, how, such, a, force, existing, independently, outside, of, the, mind, could, causally, interact, with, it, vasubandhu, also, answers, several, common, objections, to, the, buddhist, not, self, view, such, as, how, karma, works, without, a, self, and, what, exactly, undergoes, rebirth, vasubandhu, points, to, the, causal, continuum, of, aggregates, processes, which, undergoes, various, changes, leading, to, future, karmic, events, and, rebirth, during, vasubandhu, s, era, the, philosophy, of, space, and, time, was, an, important, issue, in, buddhist, philosophy, the, sarv, stiv, din, tradition, which, vasubandhu, studied, held, the, view, of, the, existence, of, dharmas, phenomenal, events, in, all, three, times, past, present, future, this, was, said, to, be, their, defining, theoretical, position, hence, their, name, sarv, stiv, da, is, sanskrit, for, theory, of, all, exists, in, contrast, to, this, eternalist, view, the, sautr, ntika, a, rival, offshoot, held, the, doctrine, of, extreme, momentariness, a, form, of, presentism, only, the, present, moment, exists, in, the, abhidharmako, ak, rik, vasubandhu, puts, forth, the, sarv, stiv, din, theory, and, then, in, his, commentary, bhasya, he, critiques, this, theory, and, argues, for, the, momentariness, of, the, sautr, ntika, he, also, later, wrote, the, karma, siddhi, prakara, a, exposition, establishing, karma, which, also, expounded, the, momentariness, view, k, anikav, da, vasubandhu, s, view, here, is, that, each, dharma, comes, into, existence, only, for, a, moment, in, which, it, discharges, its, causal, efficacy, and, then, self, destructs, the, stream, of, experience, is, then, a, causal, series, of, momentary, dharmas, the, issue, of, continuity, and, transference, of, karma, is, explained, in, the, latter, text, by, an, exposition, of, the, storehouse, consciousness, layavij, na, which, stores, karmic, seeds, b, ja, and, survives, rebirth, according, to, dan, lusthaus, vasubandhu, s, major, ideas, are, vasubandhu, s, main, yogacara, works, vi, atik, and, tri, ik, put, forth, the, theory, of, vij, aptim, tra, which, has, been, rendered, variously, as, representation, only, consciousness, only, and, appearance, only, while, some, scholars, such, as, lusthaus, see, vasubandhu, as, expounding, a, phenomenology, of, experience, others, sean, butler, see, him, as, expounding, some, form, of, idealism, similar, to, kant, or, george, berkeley, the, twenty, verses, begins, by, stating, in, mahayana, philosophy, viewed, as, being, consciousness, only, mind, citta, thought, manas, consciousness, chit, and, perception, pratyaksa, are, synonyms, the, word, mind, citta, includes, mental, states, and, mental, activities, in, its, meaning, the, word, only, is, intended, to, deny, the, existence, of, any, external, objects, of, consciousness, we, recognize, of, course, that, mental, representations, seem, to, be, correlated, with, external, non, mental, objects, but, this, may, be, no, different, from, situations, in, which, people, with, vision, disorders, see, hairs, moons, and, other, things, that, are, not, there, one, of, vasubandhu, s, main, arguments, in, the, twenty, verses, is, the, dream, argument, which, he, uses, to, show, that, it, is, possible, for, mental, representations, to, appear, to, be, restricted, by, space, and, time, he, uses, the, example, of, mass, hallucinations, in, buddhist, hell, to, defend, against, those, who, would, doubt, that, mental, appearances, can, be, shared, to, counter, the, argument, that, mere, mental, events, have, no, causal, efficacy, he, uses, the, example, of, a, wet, dream, vasubandhu, then, turns, to, a, mereological, critique, of, physical, theories, such, as, buddhist, atomism, and, hindu, monism, showing, that, his, appearance, only, view, is, much, more, parsimonious, and, rational, the, thirty, verses, also, outlines, the, yogacara, theory, of, the, eight, consciousnesses, and, how, each, one, can, be, overcome, by, the, stages, of, enlightenment, turning, consciousness, vijnana, into, unmediated, cognition, jnana, by, cleansing, the, stream, of, consciousness, from, contaminations, and, defilements, the, treatise, on, buddha, nature, was, extremely, influential, in, east, asian, buddhism, by, propounding, the, concept, of, tathagatagarbha, buddha, nature, the, thirty, verses, and, the, three, natures, exposition, trisvabhavanirdesha, does, not, like, the, twenty, verses, argue, for, appearance, only, but, assumes, it, and, uses, it, to, explain, the, nature, of, experience, which, is, of, three, natures, or, three, modes, these, are, the, fabricated, nature, parikalpitasvabh, va, the, dependent, paratantrasvabh, va, and, the, absolute, parini, pannasvabh, va, the, fabricated, nature, is, the, world, of, everyday, experience, and, mental, appearances, dependent, nature, is, the, causal, process, of, the, arising, of, the, fabricated, nature, while, the, absolute, nature, is, things, as, they, are, in, themselves, with, no, subject, object, distinction, according, to, vasubandhu, the, absolute, reality, itself, dharmat, is, non, dual, and, the, dichotomy, of, perception, into, perceiver, and, perceived, is, actually, a, conceptual, fabrication, for, vasubandhu, to, say, that, something, is, non, dual, is, that, it, is, both, conceptually, non, dual, and, perceptually, non, dual, to, say, that, i, exist, is, to, conceptually, divide, the, causal, flux, of, the, world, into, self, and, other, a, false, construct, just, the, same, to, say, that, an, observed, object, is, separate, from, the, observer, is, also, to, impute, a, false, conception, into, the, world, as, it, really, is, perception, only, vasubandhu, uses, the, analogy, of, a, magician, who, uses, a, magic, spell, dependent, nature, conceptual, construction, to, make, a, piece, of, wood, the, absolute, non, duality, look, like, an, elephant, fabricated, nature, duality, the, basic, problem, for, living, beings, who, suffer, is, that, they, are, fooled, by, the, illusion, into, thinking, that, it, is, real, that, self, and, duality, exists, true, wisdom, is, seeing, through, this, illusion, vasubandhu, contributed, to, buddhist, logic, and, is, held, to, have, been, the, origin, of, formal, logic, in, the, indian, logico, epistemological, tradition, he, was, particularly, interested, in, formal, logic, to, fortify, his, contributions, to, the, traditions, of, dialectical, contestability, and, debate, anacker, 2005, p, 31, holds, that, a, method, for, argumentation, v, da, vidhi, is, the, only, work, on, logic, by, vasabandhu, which, has, to, any, extent, survived, it, is, the, earliest, of, the, treatises, known, to, have, been, written, by, him, on, the, subject, this, is, all, the, more, interesting, because, v, da, vidhi, marks, the, dawn, of, indian, formal, logic, the, title, method, for, argumentation, indicates, that, vasabandhu, s, concern, with, logic, was, primarily, motivated, by, the, wish, to, mould, formally, flawless, arguments, and, is, thus, a, result, of, his, interest, in, philosophical, debate, this, text, also, paved, the, way, for, the, later, developments, of, dignaga, and, dharmakirti, in, the, field, of, logic
