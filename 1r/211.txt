aristophanes, r, s, t, f, n, i, z, ancient, greek, pronounced, c, 446, c, 386, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, comic, playwright, from, athens, and, a, poet, of, old, attic, comedy, he, wrote, in, total, forty, plays, of, which, eleven, survive, virtually, complete, today, these, provide, the, most, valuable, examples, of, a, genre, of, comic, drama, known, as, old, comedy, and, are, used, to, define, it, along, with, fragments, from, dozens, of, lost, plays, by, aristophanes, and, his, contemporaries, also, known, as, the, father, of, comedy, and, the, prince, of, ancient, comedy, aristophanes, has, been, said, to, recreate, the, life, of, ancient, athens, more, convincingly, than, any, other, author, his, powers, of, ridicule, were, feared, and, acknowledged, by, influential, contemporaries, plato, singled, out, aristophanes, play, the, clouds, as, slander, that, contributed, to, the, trial, and, subsequent, condemning, to, death, of, socrates, although, other, satirical, playwrights, had, also, caricatured, the, philosopher, aristophanes, second, play, the, babylonians, now, lost, was, denounced, by, cleon, as, a, slander, against, the, athenian, polis, it, is, possible, that, the, case, was, argued, in, court, but, details, of, the, trial, are, not, recorded, and, aristophanes, caricatured, cleon, mercilessly, in, his, subsequent, plays, especially, the, knights, the, first, of, many, plays, that, he, directed, himself, in, my, opinion, he, says, through, that, play, s, chorus, the, author, director, of, comedies, has, the, hardest, job, of, all, the, english, name, aristophanes, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, meaning, one, who, appears, best, from, ristos, lit, best, and, phan, s, from, the, verb, lit, to, appear, an, athenian, citizen, aristophanes, came, from, the, deme, of, kydathenaion, his, father, was, philippus, from, the, attic, phyle, clan, of, pandionis, and, his, mother, was, zenodora, his, family, was, believed, to, have, owned, property, on, the, island, of, aegina, little, is, known, about, aristophanes, life, his, plays, being, the, main, source, of, biographical, information, it, was, conventional, in, old, comedy, for, the, chorus, to, speak, on, behalf, of, the, author, during, an, address, called, the, parabasis, where, some, biographical, facts, can, usually, be, found, these, facts, however, relate, almost, entirely, to, his, career, as, a, dramatist, and, the, plays, contain, few, clear, and, unambiguous, clues, about, his, personal, beliefs, or, his, private, life, he, was, a, comic, poet, in, an, age, when, it, was, conventional, for, a, poet, to, assume, the, role, of, teacher, didaskalos, and, though, this, specifically, referred, to, his, training, of, the, chorus, in, rehearsal, it, also, covered, his, relationship, with, the, audience, as, a, commentator, on, significant, issues, aristophanes, claimed, to, be, writing, for, a, clever, and, discerning, audience, yet, he, also, declared, that, other, times, would, judge, the, audience, according, to, its, reception, of, his, plays, he, sometimes, boasts, of, his, originality, as, a, dramatist, yet, his, plays, consistently, espouse, opposition, to, radical, new, influences, in, athenian, society, he, caricatured, leading, figures, in, the, arts, notably, euripides, whose, influence, on, his, own, work, however, he, once, grudgingly, acknowledged, in, politics, especially, the, populist, cleon, and, in, philosophy, religion, where, socrates, was, the, most, obvious, target, such, caricatures, seem, to, imply, that, aristophanes, was, an, old, fashioned, conservative, yet, that, view, of, him, leads, to, contradictions, it, has, been, argued, that, aristophanes, produced, plays, mainly, to, entertain, the, audience, and, to, win, prestigious, competitions, his, plays, were, written, for, production, at, the, great, dramatic, festivals, of, athens, the, lenaia, and, city, dionysia, where, they, were, judged, and, awarded, prizes, in, competition, with, the, works, of, other, comic, dramatists, an, elaborate, series, of, lotteries, designed, to, prevent, prejudice, and, corruption, reduced, the, voting, judges, at, the, city, dionysia, to, just, five, these, judges, probably, reflected, the, mood, of, the, audiences, yet, there, is, much, uncertainty, about, the, composition, of, those, audiences, the, theatres, were, certainly, huge, with, seating, for, at, least, 10, 000, at, the, theatre, of, dionysus, the, day, s, program, at, the, city, dionysia, for, example, was, crowded, with, three, tragedies, and, a, satyr, play, ahead, of, a, comedy, but, it, is, possible, that, many, of, the, poorer, citizens, typically, the, main, supporters, of, demagogues, like, cleon, occupied, the, festival, holiday, with, other, pursuits, the, conservative, views, expressed, in, the, plays, might, therefore, reflect, the, attitudes, of, the, dominant, group, in, an, unrepresentative, audience, the, production, process, might, also, have, influenced, the, views, expressed, in, the, plays, throughout, most, of, aristophanes, career, the, chorus, was, essential, to, a, play, s, success, and, it, was, recruited, and, funded, by, a, choregus, a, wealthy, citizen, appointed, to, the, task, by, one, of, the, archons, a, choregus, could, regard, his, personal, expenditure, on, the, chorus, as, a, civic, duty, and, a, public, honour, but, aristophanes, showed, in, the, knights, that, wealthy, citizens, might, regard, civic, responsibilities, as, punishment, imposed, on, them, by, demagogues, and, populists, like, cleon, thus, the, political, conservatism, of, the, plays, may, reflect, the, views, of, the, wealthiest, section, of, athenian, society, on, whose, generosity, all, dramatists, depended, for, putting, on, their, plays, when, aristophanes, first, play, the, banqueters, was, produced, athens, was, an, ambitious, imperial, power, and, the, peloponnesian, war, was, only, in, its, fourth, year, his, plays, often, express, pride, in, the, achievement, of, the, older, generation, the, victors, at, marathon, yet, they, are, not, jingoistic, and, they, are, staunchly, opposed, to, the, war, with, sparta, the, plays, are, particularly, scathing, in, criticism, of, war, profiteers, among, whom, populists, such, as, cleon, figure, prominently, by, the, time, his, last, play, was, produced, around, 386, bc, athens, had, been, defeated, in, war, its, empire, had, been, dismantled, and, it, had, undergone, a, transformation, from, being, the, political, to, the, intellectual, centre, of, greece, aristophanes, was, part, of, this, transformation, and, he, shared, in, the, intellectual, fashions, of, the, period, the, structure, of, his, plays, evolves, from, old, comedy, until, in, his, last, surviving, play, wealth, ii, it, more, closely, resembles, new, comedy, however, it, is, uncertain, whether, he, led, or, merely, responded, to, changes, in, audience, expectations, aristophanes, won, second, prize, at, the, city, dionysia, in, 427, bc, with, his, first, play, the, banqueters, now, lost, he, won, first, prize, there, with, his, next, play, the, babylonians, also, now, lost, it, was, usual, for, foreign, dignitaries, to, attend, the, city, dionysia, and, the, babylonians, caused, some, embarrassment, for, the, athenian, authorities, since, it, depicted, the, cities, of, the, delian, league, as, slaves, grinding, at, a, mill, some, influential, citizens, notably, cleon, reviled, the, play, as, slander, against, the, polis, and, possibly, took, legal, action, against, the, author, the, details, of, the, trial, are, unrecorded, but, speaking, through, the, hero, of, his, third, play, the, acharnians, staged, at, the, lenaia, where, there, were, few, or, no, foreign, dignitaries, the, poet, carefully, distinguishes, between, the, polis, and, the, real, targets, of, his, acerbic, wit, people, among, us, and, i, don, t, mean, the, polis, remember, this, i, don, t, mean, the, polis, but, wicked, little, men, of, a, counterfeit, kind, aristophanes, repeatedly, savages, cleon, in, his, later, plays, but, these, satirical, diatribes, appear, to, have, had, no, effect, on, cleon, s, political, career, a, few, weeks, after, the, performance, of, the, knights, a, play, full, of, anti, cleon, jokes, cleon, was, elected, to, the, prestigious, board, of, ten, generals, cleon, also, seems, to, have, had, no, real, power, to, limit, or, control, aristophanes, the, caricatures, of, him, continued, up, to, and, even, beyond, his, death, in, the, absence, of, clear, biographical, facts, about, aristophanes, scholars, make, educated, guesses, based, on, interpretation, of, the, language, in, the, plays, inscriptions, and, summaries, or, comments, by, hellenistic, and, byzantine, scholars, can, also, provide, useful, clues, we, know, from, a, combination, of, these, sources, and, especially, from, comments, in, the, knights, and, the, clouds, that, aristophanes, first, three, plays, were, not, directed, by, him, they, were, instead, directed, by, callistratus, and, philoneides, an, arrangement, that, seemed, to, suit, aristophanes, since, he, appears, to, have, used, these, same, directors, in, many, later, plays, as, well, philoneides, for, example, later, directed, the, frogs, and, he, was, also, credited, perhaps, wrongly, with, directing, the, wasps, aristophanes, s, use, of, directors, complicates, our, reliance, on, the, plays, as, sources, of, biographical, information, because, apparent, self, references, might, have, been, made, with, reference, to, his, directors, instead, thus, for, example, a, statement, by, the, chorus, in, the, acharnians, seems, to, indicate, that, the, poet, had, a, close, personal, association, with, the, island, of, aegina, similarly, the, hero, in, the, acharnians, complains, about, cleon, dragging, me, into, court, over, last, year, s, play, comments, made, by, the, chorus, referring, to, aristophanes, in, the, clouds, have, been, interpreted, as, evidence, that, he, can, hardly, have, been, more, than, 18, years, old, when, his, first, play, the, banqueters, was, produced, the, second, parabasis, in, wasps, appears, to, indicate, that, he, reached, some, kind, of, temporary, accommodation, with, cleon, following, either, the, controversy, over, the, babylonians, or, a, subsequent, controversy, over, the, knights, it, has, been, inferred, from, statements, in, the, clouds, and, peace, that, aristophanes, was, prematurely, bald, aristophanes, was, probably, victorious, at, least, once, at, the, city, dionysia, with, babylonians, in, 427, and, at, least, three, times, at, the, lenaia, with, the, acharnians, in, 425, knights, in, 424, and, frogs, in, 405, frogs, in, fact, won, the, unique, distinction, of, a, repeat, performance, at, a, subsequent, festival, a, son, of, aristophanes, araros, was, also, a, comic, poet, and, he, could, have, been, heavily, involved, in, the, production, of, his, father, s, play, wealth, ii, in, 388, araros, is, also, thought, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, posthumous, performances, of, the, now, lost, plays, aeolosicon, ii, and, cocalus, and, it, is, possible, that, the, last, of, these, won, the, prize, at, the, city, dionysia, in, 387, it, appears, that, a, second, son, philippus, was, twice, victorious, at, the, lenaia, and, he, could, have, directed, some, of, eubulus, comedies, a, third, son, was, called, either, nicostratus, or, philetaerus, and, a, man, by, the, latter, name, appears, in, the, catalogue, of, lenaia, victors, with, two, victories, the, first, probably, in, the, late, 370s, plato, s, the, symposium, appears, to, be, a, useful, source, of, biographical, information, about, aristophanes, but, its, reliability, is, open, to, doubt, it, purports, to, be, a, record, of, conversations, at, a, dinner, party, at, which, both, aristophanes, and, socrates, are, guests, held, some, seven, years, after, the, performance, of, the, clouds, the, play, in, which, socrates, was, cruelly, caricatured, one, of, the, guests, alcibiades, even, quotes, from, the, play, when, teasing, socrates, over, his, appearance, and, yet, there, is, no, indication, of, any, ill, feeling, between, socrates, and, aristophanes, plato, s, aristophanes, is, in, fact, a, genial, character, and, this, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, plato, s, own, friendship, with, him, their, friendship, appears, to, be, corroborated, by, an, epitaph, for, aristophanes, reputedly, written, by, plato, in, which, the, playwright, s, soul, is, compared, to, an, eternal, shrine, for, the, graces, plato, was, only, a, boy, when, the, events, in, the, symposium, are, supposed, to, have, occurred, and, it, is, possible, that, his, aristophanes, is, in, fact, based, on, a, reading, of, the, plays, for, example, conversation, among, the, guests, turns, to, the, subject, of, love, and, aristophanes, explains, his, notion, of, it, in, terms, of, an, amusing, allegory, a, device, he, often, uses, in, his, plays, he, is, represented, as, suffering, an, attack, of, hiccups, and, this, might, be, a, humorous, reference, to, the, crude, physical, jokes, in, his, plays, he, tells, the, other, guests, that, he, is, quite, happy, to, be, thought, amusing, but, he, is, wary, of, appearing, ridiculous, this, fear, of, being, ridiculed, is, consistent, with, his, declaration, in, the, knights, that, he, embarked, on, the, career, of, comic, playwright, warily, after, witnessing, the, public, contempt, and, ridicule, that, other, dramatists, had, incurred, aristophanes, survived, the, peloponnesian, war, two, oligarchic, revolutions, and, two, democratic, restorations, this, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, that, he, was, not, actively, involved, in, politics, despite, his, highly, political, plays, he, was, probably, appointed, to, the, council, of, five, hundred, for, a, year, at, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, century, but, such, appointments, were, very, common, in, democratic, athens, the, language, of, aristophanes, plays, and, in, old, comedy, generally, was, valued, by, ancient, commentators, as, a, model, of, the, attic, dialect, the, orator, quintilian, believed, that, the, charm, and, grandeur, of, the, attic, dialect, made, old, comedy, an, example, for, orators, to, study, and, follow, and, he, considered, it, inferior, in, these, respects, only, to, the, works, of, homer, a, revival, of, interest, in, the, attic, dialect, may, have, been, responsible, for, the, recovery, and, circulation, of, aristophanes, plays, during, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, ad, resulting, in, their, survival, today, in, aristophanes, plays, the, attic, dialect, is, couched, in, verse, and, his, plays, can, be, appreciated, for, their, poetic, qualities, for, aristophanes, contemporaries, the, works, of, homer, and, hesiod, formed, the, cornerstones, of, hellenic, history, and, culture, thus, poetry, had, a, moral, and, social, significance, that, made, it, an, inevitable, topic, of, comic, satire, aristophanes, was, very, conscious, of, literary, fashions, and, traditions, and, his, plays, feature, numerous, references, to, other, poets, these, include, not, only, rival, comic, dramatists, such, as, eupolis, and, hermippus, and, predecessors, such, as, magnes, crates, and, cratinus, but, also, tragedians, notably, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, all, three, of, whom, are, mentioned, in, e, g, the, frogs, aristophanes, was, the, equal, of, these, great, tragedians, in, his, subtle, use, of, lyrics, he, appears, to, have, modelled, his, approach, to, language, on, that, of, euripides, in, particular, so, much, so, that, the, comic, dramatist, cratinus, labelled, him, a, euripidaristophanist, addicted, to, hair, splitting, niceties, a, full, appreciation, of, aristophanes, plays, requires, an, understanding, of, the, poetic, forms, he, employed, with, virtuoso, skill, and, of, their, different, rhythms, and, associations, there, were, three, broad, poetic, forms, iambic, dialogue, tetrameter, verses, and, lyrics, the, rhythm, begins, at, a, typical, anapestic, gallop, slows, down, to, consider, the, revered, poets, hesiod, and, homer, then, gallops, off, again, to, its, comic, conclusion, at, the, expense, of, the, unfortunate, pantocles, such, subtle, variations, in, rhythm, are, common, in, the, plays, allowing, for, serious, points, to, be, made, while, still, whetting, the, audience, s, appetite, for, the, next, joke, though, to, myself, i, often, seem, a, bright, chap, and, not, awkward, none, comes, close, to, amynias, son, of, sellos, of, the, bigwig, clan, a, man, i, once, saw, dine, with, rich, leogorus, now, as, poor, as, antiphon, he, lives, on, apples, and, pomegranates, yet, he, got, himself, appointed, ambassador, to, pharsalus, way, up, there, in, thessaly, home, of, the, poor, penestes, happy, to, be, where, everyone, is, as, penniless, as, he, is, it, can, be, argued, that, the, most, important, feature, of, the, language, of, the, plays, is, imagery, particularly, the, use, of, similes, metaphors, and, pictorial, expressions, in, the, knights, for, example, the, ears, of, a, character, with, selective, hearing, are, represented, as, parasols, that, open, and, close, in, the, frogs, aeschylus, is, said, to, compose, verses, in, the, manner, of, a, horse, rolling, in, a, sandpit, some, plays, feature, revelations, of, human, perfectibility, that, are, poetic, rather, than, religious, in, character, such, as, the, marriage, of, the, hero, pisthetairos, to, zeus, s, paramour, in, the, birds, and, the, recreation, of, old, athens, crowned, with, roses, at, the, end, of, the, knights, it, is, widely, believed, that, aristophanes, condemned, rhetoric, on, both, moral, and, political, grounds, he, states, a, speaker, trained, in, the, new, rhetoric, may, use, his, talents, to, deceive, the, jury, and, bewilder, his, opponents, so, thoroughly, that, the, trial, loses, all, semblance, of, fairness, he, is, speaking, to, the, art, of, flattery, and, evidence, points, towards, the, fact, that, many, of, aristophanes, plays, were, actually, created, with, the, intent, to, attack, the, view, of, rhetoric, the, most, noticeable, attack, can, be, seen, in, his, play, banqueters, in, which, two, brothers, from, different, educational, backgrounds, argue, over, which, education, is, better, one, brother, comes, from, a, background, of, old, fashioned, education, while, the, other, brother, appears, to, be, a, product, of, the, sophistic, education, the, chorus, was, mainly, used, by, aristophanes, as, a, defense, against, rhetoric, and, would, often, talk, about, topics, such, as, the, civic, duty, of, those, who, were, educated, in, classical, teachings, in, aristophanes, opinion, it, was, the, job, of, those, educated, adults, to, protect, the, public, from, deception, and, to, stand, as, a, beacon, of, light, for, those, who, were, more, gullible, than, others, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, aristophanes, was, so, against, the, sophists, came, into, existence, from, the, requirements, listed, by, the, leaders, of, the, organization, money, was, essential, which, meant, that, roughly, all, of, the, pupils, studying, with, the, sophists, came, from, upper, class, backgrounds, and, excluded, the, rest, of, the, polis, aristophanes, believed, that, education, and, knowledge, was, a, public, service, and, that, anything, that, excluded, willing, minds, was, nothing, but, an, abomination, he, concludes, that, all, politicians, that, study, rhetoric, must, have, doubtful, citizenships, unspeakable, morals, and, too, much, arrogance, the, plays, of, aristophanes, are, among, the, defining, examples, of, old, comedy, aristophanes, plays, are, also, the, only, full, length, old, comedy, plays, that, have, survived, from, antiquity, thus, making, them, literally, among, the, most, defining, elements, for, defining, old, comedy, for, this, reason, an, understanding, of, old, comedy, and, aristophanes, place, in, it, is, useful, to, comprehend, his, plays, in, their, historical, and, cultural, context, the, themes, of, old, comedy, included, the, structural, elements, of, a, typical, aristophanic, plot, can, be, summarized, as, follows, the, rules, of, competition, did, not, prevent, a, playwright, arranging, and, adjusting, these, elements, to, suit, his, particular, needs, in, the, acharnians, and, peace, for, example, there, is, no, formal, agon, whereas, in, the, clouds, there, are, two, agons, the, parabasis, is, an, address, to, the, audience, by, the, chorus, or, chorus, leader, while, the, actors, leave, or, have, left, the, stage, in, this, role, the, chorus, is, sometimes, out, of, character, as, the, author, s, voice, and, sometimes, in, character, although, these, capacities, are, often, difficult, to, distinguish, generally, the, parabasis, occurs, somewhere, in, the, middle, of, a, play, and, often, there, is, a, second, parabasis, towards, the, end, the, elements, of, a, parabasis, have, been, defined, and, named, by, scholars, but, it, is, probable, that, aristophanes, own, understanding, was, less, formal, the, selection, of, elements, can, vary, from, play, to, play, and, it, varies, considerably, within, plays, between, first, and, second, parabasis, the, early, plays, the, acharnians, to, the, birds, are, fairly, uniform, in, their, approach, however, and, the, following, elements, of, a, parabasis, can, be, found, within, them, the, wasps, is, thought, to, offer, the, best, example, of, a, conventional, approach, and, the, elements, of, a, parabasis, can, be, identified, and, located, in, that, play, as, follows, textual, corruption, is, probably, the, reason, for, the, absence, of, the, antistrophe, in, the, second, parabasis, however, there, are, several, variations, from, the, ideal, even, within, the, early, plays, for, example, the, parabasis, proper, in, the, clouds, lines, 518, 562, is, composed, in, eupolidean, meter, rather, than, in, anapests, and, the, second, parabasis, includes, a, kommation, but, it, lacks, strophe, antistrophe, and, antepirrhema, the, clouds, lines, 1113, 1130, the, second, parabasis, in, the, acharnians, lines, 971, 999, can, be, considered, a, hybrid, parabasis, song, i, e, the, declaimed, sections, are, merely, continuations, of, the, strophe, and, antistrophe, and, unlike, the, typical, parabasis, it, seems, to, comment, on, actions, that, occur, on, stage, during, the, address, an, understanding, of, old, comedy, conventions, such, as, the, parabasis, is, necessary, for, a, proper, understanding, of, aristophanes, plays, on, the, other, hand, a, sensitive, appreciation, of, the, plays, is, necessary, for, a, proper, understanding, of, the, conventions, the, tragic, dramatists, sophocles, and, euripides, died, near, the, end, of, the, peloponnesian, war, and, the, art, of, tragedy, thereafter, ceased, to, develop, yet, comedy, continued, to, evolve, after, the, defeat, of, athens, and, it, is, possible, that, it, did, so, because, in, aristophanes, it, had, a, master, craftsman, who, lived, long, enough, to, help, usher, it, into, a, new, age, indeed, according, to, one, ancient, source, platonius, c, 9th, century, ad, one, of, aristophanes, s, last, plays, aioliskon, had, neither, a, parabasis, nor, any, choral, lyrics, making, it, a, type, of, middle, comedy, while, kolakos, anticipated, all, the, elements, of, new, comedy, including, a, rape, and, a, recognition, scene, aristophanes, seems, to, have, had, some, appreciation, of, his, formative, role, in, the, development, of, comedy, as, indicated, by, his, comment, in, clouds, that, his, audience, would, be, judged, by, other, times, according, to, its, reception, of, his, plays, clouds, was, awarded, third, i, e, last, place, after, its, original, performance, and, the, text, that, has, come, down, to, the, modern, age, was, a, subsequent, draft, that, aristophanes, intended, to, be, read, rather, than, acted, the, circulation, of, his, plays, in, manuscript, extended, their, influence, beyond, the, original, audience, over, whom, in, fact, they, seem, to, have, had, little, or, no, practical, influence, they, did, not, affect, the, career, of, cleon, they, failed, to, persuade, the, athenians, to, pursue, an, honourable, peace, with, sparta, and, it, is, not, clear, that, they, were, instrumental, in, the, trial, and, execution, of, socrates, whose, death, probably, resulted, from, public, animosity, towards, the, philosopher, s, disgraced, associates, such, as, alcibiades, exacerbated, of, course, by, his, own, intransigence, during, the, trial, the, plays, in, manuscript, form, have, been, put, to, some, surprising, uses, as, indicated, earlier, they, were, used, in, the, study, of, rhetoric, on, the, recommendation, of, quintilian, and, by, students, of, the, attic, dialect, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, ad, it, is, possible, that, plato, sent, copies, of, the, plays, to, dionysius, of, syracuse, so, that, he, might, learn, about, athenian, life, and, government, latin, translations, of, the, plays, by, andreas, divus, venice, 1528, were, circulated, widely, throughout, europe, in, the, renaissance, and, these, were, soon, followed, by, translations, and, adaptations, in, modern, languages, racine, for, example, drew, les, plaideurs, 1668, from, the, wasps, goethe, who, turned, to, aristophanes,
