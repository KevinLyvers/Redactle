american, lands, a, persuasive, orator, tecumseh, traveled, widely, forming, a, native, american, confederacy, and, promoting, intertribal, unity, even, though, his, efforts, to, unite, native, americans, ended, with, his, death, in, the, war, of, 1812, he, became, an, iconic, folk, hero, in, american, indigenous, and, canadian, popular, history, tecumseh, was, born, in, what, is, now, ohio, at, a, time, when, the, far, flung, shawnees, were, reuniting, in, their, ohio, country, homeland, during, his, childhood, the, shawnees, lost, territory, to, the, expanding, american, colonies, in, a, series, of, border, conflicts, tecumseh, s, father, was, killed, in, battle, against, american, colonists, in, 1774, tecumseh, was, thereafter, mentored, by, his, older, brother, cheeseekau, a, noted, war, chief, who, died, fighting, americans, in, 1792, as, a, young, war, leader, tecumseh, joined, shawnee, chief, blue, jacket, s, armed, struggle, against, further, american, encroachment, which, ended, in, defeat, at, the, battle, of, fallen, timbers, in, 1794, and, with, the, loss, of, most, of, ohio, in, the, 1795, treaty, of, greenville, in, 1805, tecumseh, s, younger, brother, tenskwatawa, who, came, to, be, known, as, the, shawnee, prophet, founded, a, religious, movement, that, called, upon, native, americans, to, reject, european, influences, and, return, to, a, more, traditional, lifestyle, in, 1808, tecumseh, and, tenskwatawa, established, prophetstown, a, village, in, present, day, indiana, that, grew, into, a, large, multi, tribal, community, tecumseh, traveled, constantly, spreading, the, prophet, s, message, and, eclipsing, his, brother, in, prominence, tecumseh, proclaimed, that, native, americans, owned, their, lands, in, common, and, urged, tribes, not, to, cede, more, territory, unless, all, agreed, his, message, alarmed, american, leaders, as, well, as, native, leaders, who, sought, accommodation, with, the, united, states, in, 1811, when, tecumseh, was, in, the, south, recruiting, allies, americans, under, william, henry, harrison, defeated, tenskwatawa, at, the, battle, of, tippecanoe, and, destroyed, prophetstown, in, the, war, of, 1812, tecumseh, joined, his, cause, with, the, british, recruited, warriors, and, helped, capture, detroit, in, august, 1812, the, following, year, he, led, an, unsuccessful, campaign, against, the, united, states, in, ohio, and, indiana, when, u, s, naval, forces, took, control, of, lake, erie, in, 1813, tecumseh, reluctantly, retreated, with, the, british, into, upper, canada, where, american, forces, engaged, them, at, the, battle, of, the, thames, on, october, 5, 1813, in, which, tecumseh, was, killed, his, death, caused, his, confederacy, to, collapse, the, lands, he, had, fought, to, defend, were, eventually, ceded, to, the, u, s, government, his, legacy, as, one, of, the, most, celebrated, native, americans, in, history, grew, in, the, years, after, his, death, although, details, of, his, life, have, often, been, obscured, by, mythology, tecumseh, was, born, in, shawnee, territory, in, what, is, now, ohio, between, 1764, and, 1771, the, best, evidence, suggests, a, birthdate, of, around, march, 1768, the, shawnee, pronunciation, of, his, name, has, traditionally, been, rendered, by, non, shawnee, sources, as, tecumth, he, was, born, into, the, panther, clan, of, the, kispoko, division, of, the, shawnee, tribe, like, most, shawnees, his, name, indicated, his, clan, translations, of, his, name, from, the, shawnee, language, include, i, cross, the, way, and, shooting, star, references, to, a, meteor, associated, with, the, panther, clan, later, stories, claimed, that, tecumseh, was, named, after, a, shooting, star, that, appeared, at, his, birth, although, his, father, and, most, of, his, siblings, as, members, of, the, panther, clan, were, named, after, the, same, meteor, tecumseh, was, likely, born, in, the, shawnee, town, of, chillicothe, in, the, scioto, river, valley, near, present, day, chillicothe, ohio, or, in, a, nearby, kispoko, village, tecumseh, s, father, puckeshinwau, was, a, shawnee, war, chief, of, the, kispoko, division, tecumseh, s, mother, methoataaskee, probably, belonged, to, the, pekowi, division, and, the, turtle, clan, although, some, traditions, maintain, that, she, was, muscogee, his, mother, may, have, been, a, blood, relative, of, william, weatherford, tecumseh, was, the, fifth, of, eight, children, his, parents, met, and, married, in, what, is, now, alabama, where, many, shawnees, had, settled, after, being, driven, out, of, the, ohio, country, by, the, iroquois, in, the, 17th, century, beaver, wars, around, 1759, puckeshinwau, and, methoataaskee, moved, to, the, ohio, country, as, part, of, a, shawnee, effort, to, reunite, in, their, traditional, homeland, in, 1763, the, british, empire, laid, claim, to, the, ohio, country, following, its, victory, in, the, french, and, indian, war, that, year, cheeseekau, took, part, in, pontiac, s, war, a, pan, tribal, effort, to, counter, british, control, of, the, region, tecumseh, was, born, in, the, peaceful, decade, after, pontiac, s, war, a, time, when, puckeshinwau, likely, became, the, chief, of, the, kispoko, town, on, the, scioto, in, a, 1768, treaty, the, iroquois, ceded, land, south, of, the, ohio, river, including, present, day, kentucky, to, the, british, a, region, the, shawnee, and, other, tribes, used, for, hunting, shawnees, attempted, to, organize, further, resistance, against, colonial, occupation, of, the, region, culminating, in, the, 1774, battle, of, point, pleasant, in, which, puckeshinwau, was, killed, after, the, battle, shawnees, ceded, kentucky, to, the, colonists, when, the, american, revolutionary, war, between, the, british, and, their, american, colonies, began, in, 1775, many, shawnees, allied, themselves, with, the, british, raiding, into, kentucky, with, the, aim, of, driving, out, american, settlers, tecumseh, too, young, to, fight, was, among, those, forced, to, relocate, in, the, face, of, american, counterraids, in, 1777, his, family, moved, from, the, scioto, river, to, a, kispoko, town, on, the, mad, river, near, present, day, springfield, ohio, general, george, rogers, clark, commander, of, the, kentucky, militia, led, a, major, expedition, into, shawnee, territory, in, 1780, tecumseh, may, have, witnessed, the, ensuing, battle, of, piqua, on, august, 8, after, the, shawnees, retreated, clark, burned, their, villages, and, crops, the, shawnees, relocated, to, the, northwest, along, the, great, miami, river, but, clark, returned, in, 1782, and, destroyed, those, villages, as, well, forcing, the, shawnees, to, retreat, further, north, near, present, day, bellefontaine, ohio, after, the, american, revolutionary, war, ended, in, 1783, the, united, states, claimed, the, lands, north, of, the, ohio, river, by, right, of, conquest, britain, had, renounced, its, claims, to, the, area, in, the, treaty, of, paris, in, response, indians, convened, a, great, intertribal, conference, at, lower, sandusky, in, the, summer, of, 1783, speakers, most, notably, joseph, brant, of, the, mohawk, argued, that, indians, must, unite, to, hold, onto, their, lands, they, put, forth, a, doctrine, that, indian, lands, were, held, in, common, by, all, tribes, and, so, no, further, land, should, be, ceded, to, the, united, states, without, the, consent, of, all, the, tribes, this, idea, made, a, strong, impression, on, tecumseh, just, fifteen, years, old, when, he, attended, the, conference, as, an, adult, he, would, become, such, a, well, known, advocate, of, this, policy, that, some, mistakenly, thought, it, had, originated, with, him, the, united, states, however, insisted, on, dealing, with, the, tribes, individually, getting, each, to, sign, separate, land, treaties, in, january, 1786, moluntha, civil, chief, of, the, mekoche, shawnee, division, signed, the, treaty, of, fort, finney, surrendering, most, of, ohio, to, the, americans, later, that, year, moluntha, was, murdered, by, a, kentucky, militiaman, initiating, a, new, border, war, tecumseh, now, about, eighteen, years, old, became, a, warrior, under, the, tutelage, of, his, older, brother, cheeseekau, who, emerged, as, a, noted, war, chief, tecumseh, participated, in, attacks, on, flatboats, traveling, down, the, ohio, river, carrying, waves, of, immigrants, into, lands, the, shawnees, had, lost, he, was, disturbed, by, the, sight, of, prisoners, being, cruelly, treated, by, the, shawnees, an, early, indication, of, his, lifelong, aversion, to, torture, and, cruelty, for, which, he, would, later, be, celebrated, in, 1788, tecumseh, cheeseekau, and, their, family, moved, westward, relocating, near, cape, girardeau, missouri, they, hoped, to, be, free, of, american, settlers, only, to, find, colonists, moving, there, as, well, so, they, did, not, stay, long, in, late, 1789, or, early, 1790, tecumseh, traveled, south, with, cheeseekau, to, live, with, the, chickamauga, cherokees, near, lookout, mountain, in, what, is, now, tennessee, some, shawnees, already, lived, among, the, chickamaugas, who, were, fierce, opponents, of, u, s, expansion, cheeseekau, led, about, forty, shawnees, in, raids, against, colonists, tecumseh, was, presumably, among, them, during, his, nearly, two, years, among, the, chickamaugas, tecumseh, probably, had, a, daughter, with, a, cherokee, woman, the, relationship, was, brief, and, the, child, remained, with, her, mother, in, 1791, tecumseh, returned, to, the, ohio, country, to, take, part, in, the, northwest, indian, war, as, a, minor, leader, the, native, confederacy, that, had, been, formed, to, fight, the, war, was, led, by, the, shawnee, blue, jacket, and, would, provide, a, model, for, the, confederacy, tecumseh, created, years, later, he, led, a, band, of, eight, followers, including, his, younger, brother, lalaw, thika, later, known, as, tenskwatawa, tecumseh, missed, fighting, in, a, major, indian, victory, st, clair, s, defeat, on, november, 4, because, he, was, hunting, or, scouting, at, the, time, the, following, year, he, participated, in, other, skirmishes, before, rejoining, cheeseekau, in, tennessee, tecumseh, was, with, cheeseekau, when, he, was, killed, in, an, unsuccessful, attack, on, buchanan, s, station, near, nashville, in, 1792, tecumseh, probably, sought, revenge, for, his, brother, s, death, but, the, details, are, unknown, during, this, time, he, was, somewhat, known, as, an, eloquent, speaker, among, native, americans, and, this, reputation, would, follow, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, as, he, grew, in, prominence, tecumseh, returned, to, the, ohio, country, at, the, end, of, 1792, and, fought, in, several, more, skirmishes, in, 1794, he, fought, in, the, battle, of, fallen, timbers, a, bitter, defeat, for, the, indians, the, native, confederacy, fell, apart, especially, after, blue, jacket, agreed, to, make, peace, with, the, americans, tecumseh, did, not, attend, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, greenville, 1795, in, which, about, two, thirds, of, ohio, and, portions, of, present, day, indiana, were, ceded, to, the, united, states, by, 1796, tecumseh, was, both, the, civil, and, war, chief, of, a, kispoko, band, of, about, 50, warriors, and, 250, people, his, sister, tecumapease, was, the, band, s, principal, female, chief, tecumseh, took, a, wife, mamate, and, had, a, son, paukeesaa, born, about, 1796, their, marriage, did, not, last, and, tecumapease, raised, paukeesaa, from, the, age, of, seven, or, eight, tecumseh, s, band, moved, to, various, locations, before, settling, in, 1798, close, to, delaware, indians, along, the, white, river, near, present, day, anderson, indiana, where, he, lived, for, the, next, eight, years, he, married, twice, more, during, this, time, his, third, marriage, to, white, wing, lasted, until, 1807, while, tecumseh, lived, along, the, white, river, native, americans, in, the, region, were, troubled, by, sickness, alcoholism, poverty, the, loss, of, land, depopulation, and, the, decline, of, their, traditional, way, of, life, several, religious, prophets, emerged, each, offering, explanations, and, remedies, for, the, crisis, among, these, was, tecumseh, s, younger, brother, lalaw, thika, a, healer, in, tecumseh, s, village, until, this, time, lalaw, thika, had, been, regarded, as, a, misfit, with, little, promise, in, 1805, he, began, preaching, drawing, upon, ideas, espoused, by, earlier, prophets, particularly, the, delaware, prophet, neolin, lalaw, thika, urged, listeners, to, reject, european, influences, stop, drinking, alcohol, and, discard, their, traditional, medicine, bags, tecumseh, followed, his, brother, s, teachings, by, eating, only, native, food, wearing, traditional, shawnee, clothing, and, not, drinking, alcohol, in, 1806, tecumseh, and, lalaw, thika, now, known, as, the, shawnee, prophet, established, a, new, town, near, the, ruins, of, fort, greenville, present, day, greenville, ohio, where, the, 1795, treaty, of, greenville, had, been, signed, the, prophet, s, message, spread, widely, attracting, visitors, and, converts, from, multiple, tribes, the, brothers, hoped, to, reunite, the, scattered, shawnees, at, greenville, but, they, were, opposed, by, black, hoof, a, mekoche, chief, regarded, by, americans, as, the, principal, chief, of, the, shawnees, black, hoof, and, other, leaders, around, the, shawnee, town, of, wapakoneta, urged, shawnees, to, accommodate, the, united, states, by, adopting, some, american, customs, with, the, goal, of, creating, a, shawnee, homeland, with, secure, borders, in, northern, ohio, the, prophet, s, movement, represented, a, challenge, to, the, shawnee, chiefs, who, sat, on, the, tribal, council, at, wapakoneta, most, ohio, shawnees, followed, black, hoof, s, path, and, rejected, the, prophet, s, movement, important, converts, who, joined, the, movement, at, greenville, were, blue, jacket, the, famed, shawnee, war, leader, and, roundhead, who, became, tecumseh, s, close, friend, and, ally, american, settlers, grew, uneasy, as, indians, flocked, to, greenville, in, 1806, and, 1807, tecumseh, and, blue, jacket, traveled, to, chillicothe, the, capital, of, the, new, u, s, state, of, ohio, to, reassure, the, governor, that, greenville, posed, no, threat, rumors, of, war, between, the, united, states, and, great, britain, followed, the, chesapeake, incident, of, june, 1807, to, escape, the, rising, tensions, tecumseh, and, the, prophet, decided, to, move, west, to, a, more, secure, location, farther, from, american, forts, and, closer, to, potential, western, indian, allies, in, 1808, tecumseh, and, the, prophet, established, a, village, americans, would, call, prophetstown, north, of, present, day, lafayette, indiana, the, prophet, adopted, a, new, name, tenskwatawa, the, open, door, meaning, he, was, the, door, through, which, followers, could, reach, salvation, like, greenville, prophetstown, attracted, numerous, followers, comprising, shawnees, potawatomis, kickapoos, winnebagos, sauks, ottawas, wyandots, and, iowas, an, unprecedented, variety, of, natives, living, together, perhaps, 6, 000, people, settled, in, the, area, making, it, larger, than, any, american, city, in, the, region, jortner, 2011, argues, that, prophetstown, was, effectively, an, independent, city, state, at, prophetstown, tecumseh, and, tenskwatawa, initially, worked, to, maintain, a, peaceful, coexistence, with, the, united, states, a, major, turning, point, came, in, september, 1809, when, william, henry, harrison, governor, of, the, indiana, territory, negotiated, the, treaty, of, fort, wayne, purchasing, 2, 5, to, 3, million, acres, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, km, 2, of, land, in, what, is, present, day, indiana, and, illinois, although, many, indian, leaders, signed, the, treaty, others, who, used, the, land, were, deliberately, excluded, from, the, negotiations, the, treaty, created, widespread, outrage, among, indians, and, according, to, historian, john, sugden, put, tecumseh, on, the, road, to, war, with, the, united, states, before, the, treaty, of, fort, wayne, tecumseh, was, relatively, unknown, to, outsiders, who, usually, referred, to, him, as, the, prophet, s, brother, afterwards, he, emerged, as, a, prominent, figure, as, he, built, an, intertribal, confederacy, to, counter, u, s, expansion, in, august, 1810, tecumseh, met, with, william, henry, harrison, at, vincennes, capital, of, the, indiana, territory, a, standoff, that, became, legendary, tecumseh, demanded, that, harrison, rescind, the, fort, wayne, cession, and, said, he, would, oppose, american, settlement, on, the, disputed, lands, he, said, the, chiefs, who, had, signed, the, treaty, would, be, punished, and, that, he, was, uniting, the, tribes, to, prevent, further, cessions, harrison, insisted, the, land, had, been, purchased, fairly, and, that, tecumseh, had, no, right, to, object, because, native, americans, did, not, own, land, in, common, harrison, said, he, would, send, tecumseh, s, demands, to, president, james, madison, but, did, not, expect, the, president, to, accept, them, as, the, meeting, concluded, tecumseh, said, that, if, madison, did, not, rescind, the, fort, wayne, treaty, you, and, i, will, have, to, fight, it, out, after, the, confrontation, with, harrison, tecumseh, traveled, widely, to, build, his, confederacy, he, went, westward, to, recruit, allies, among, the, potawatomis, winnebagos, sauks, foxes, kickapoos, and, missouri, shawnees, in, november, 1810, he, visited, fort, malden, in, upper, canada, to, ask, british, officials, for, assistance, in, the, coming, war, but, the, british, were, noncommittal, urging, restraint, in, may, 1811, tecumseh, visited, ohio, to, recruit, warriors, among, the, shawnees, wyandots, and, senecas, after, returning, to, prophetstown, he, sent, a, delegation, to, the, iroquois, in, new, york, in, july, 1811, tecumseh, again, met, harrison, at, vincennes, he, told, the, governor, he, had, amassed, a, confederacy, of, northern, tribes, and, was, heading, south, to, do, the, same, for, the, next, six, months, tecumseh, traveled, some, 3, 000, miles, 4, 800, km, in, the, south, and, west, to, recruit, allies, the, documentary, evidence, of, this, journey, is, fragmentary, and, was, exaggerated, in, folklore, but, he, probably, met, with, chickasaws, choctaws, muscogee, osages, western, shawnees, and, delawares, iowas, sauks, foxes, sioux, kickapoos, and, potawatomis, he, was, aided, in, his, efforts, by, two, extraordinary, events, the, great, comet, of, 1811, and, the, new, madrid, earthquake, which, he, and, other, native, americans, interpreted, as, omens, that, his, confederacy, should, be, supported, many, rejected, his, overtures, especially, in, the, south, most, notably, the, choctaws, and, chickasaws, his, most, receptive, southern, listeners, were, among, the, muscogee, a, faction, among, the, muscogee, who, became, known, as, the, red, sticks, responded, to, tecumseh, s, call, to, arms, contributing, to, the, coming, of, the, creek, war, according, to, sugden, 1997, tecumseh, had, made, a, serious, mistake, by, informing, harrison, he, would, be, absent, from, prophetstown, for, an, extended, time, harrison, wrote, that, tecumseh, s, absence, affords, a, most, favorable, opportunity, for, breaking, up, his, confederacy, in, september, 1811, harrison, marched, toward, prophetstown, with, about, 1, 000, men, in, the, pre, dawn, hours, on, november, 7, warriors, from, prophetstown, launched, a, surprise, attack, on, harrison, s, camp, initiating, the, battle, of, tippecanoe, harrison, s, men, held, their, ground, after, which, the, prophet, s, warriors, withdrew, and, evacuated, prophetstown, the, americans, burned, the, village, the, following, day, and, returned, to, vincennes, historians, have, traditionally, viewed, the, battle, of, tippecanoe, as, a, devastating, blow, to, tecumseh, s, confederacy, according, to, a, story, recorded, by, benjamin, drake, ten, years, after, the, battle, tecumseh, was, furious, with, tenskwatawa, after, the, battle, and, threatened, to, kill, him, afterwards, it, was, said, the, prophet, played, little, part, in, the, confederacy, s, leadership, modern, scholarship, has, cast, doubt, on, this, interpretation, dowd, 1992, cave, 2002, and, jortner, 2011, argued, that, stories, of, tenskwatawa, s, disgrace, originated, with, harrison, s, allies, and, are, not, supported, by, other, sources, according, to, this, view, the, battle, was, a, setback, for, tenskwatawa, but, he, continued, to, serve, as, the, confederacy, s, spiritual, leader, with, tecumseh, as, its, diplomat, and, military, leader, harrison, hoped, his, preemptive, strike, would, subdue, tecumseh, s, confederacy, but, a, wave, of, frontier, violence, erupted, after, the, battle, native, americans, many, who, had, fought, at, tippecanoe, sought, revenge, killing, as, many, as, 46, americans, tecumseh, sought, to, restrain, warriors, from, premature, action, while, preparing, the, confederacy, for, future, hostilities, by, the, time, the, united, states, declared, war, on, great, britain, in, june, 1812, as, many, as, 800, warriors, had, gathered, around, the, rebuilt, prophetstown, tecumseh, s, native, american, allies, throughout, the, northwest, territory, numbered, around, 3, 500, warriors, in, june, 1812, tecumseh, arrived, at, fort, malden, in, amherstburg, to, join, his, cause, with, the, british, in, the, war, of, 1812, the, british, had, few, troops, and, scant, resources, in, the, west, so, native, allies, were, essential, to, the, defense, of, upper, canada, the, british, quickly, recognized, tecumseh, as, the, most, influential, of, their, indian, allies, and, relied, upon, him, to, direct, the, native, forces, he, and, his, warriors, scouted, and, probed, enemy, positions, as, american, general, william, hull, crossed, into, canada, and, threatened, to, take, fort, malden, on, july, 25, tecumseh, s, warriors, skirmished, with, americans, north, of, amherstburg, inflicting, the, first, american, fatalities, of, the, war, tecumseh, turned, his, attention, to, cutting, off, hull, s, supply, and, communication, lines, on, the, u, s, side, of, the, border, south, of, detroit, on, august, 5, he, led, 25, warriors, in, two, successive, ambushes, scattering, a, far, superior, force, tecumseh, captured, hull, s, outgoing, mail, which, revealed, that, the, general, was, fearful, of, being, cut, off, on, august, 9, tecumseh, joined, with, british, soldiers, at, the, battle, of, maguaga, successfully, thwarting, hull, s, attempt, to, reopen, his, line, of, communications, two, days, later, hull, pulled, the, last, of, his, men, from, amherstburg, ending, his, attempt, to, invade, canada, on, august, 14, major, general, isaac, brock, british, commander, of, upper, canada, arrived, at, fort, malden, and, began, preparations, for, attacking, hull, at, fort, detroit, tecumseh, upon, hearing, of, brock, s, plans, reportedly, turned, to, his, companions, and, said, this, is, a, man, tecumseh, and, brock, formed, an, immediate, friendship, that, served, to, cement, the, alliance, brock, s, high, esteem, for, tecumseh, likely, contributed, to, a, popular, belief, that, tecumseh, was, appointed, a, brigadier, general, in, the, british, army, though, this, is, a, myth, tecumseh, led, about, 530, warriors, in, the, siege, of, detroit, according, to, one, account, tecumseh, had, his, men, repeatedly, pass, through, an, opening, in, the, woods, to, create, the, impression, that, thousands, of, native, americans, were, outside, the, fort, a, story, that, may, be, apocryphal, to, almost, everyone, s, astonishment, hull, decided, to, surrender, on, august, 16, afterwards, brock, wrote, of, tecumseh, he, who, attracted, most, of, my, attention, was, a, shawnee, chief, tecumset, brother, to, the, prophet, who, for, the, last, two, years, has, carried, on, contrary, to, our, remonstrances, an, active, warfare, against, the, united, states, a, more, sagacious, or, a, more, gallant, warrior, does, not, i, believe, exist, he, was, the, admiration, of, every, one, who, conversed, with, him, brock, likely, assured, tecumseh, that, the, british, would, support, native, american, land, claims, he, wrote, his, superiors, that, restoration, of, land, fraudulently, usurped, from, the, native, americans, should, be, considered, in, any, peace, treaty, news, of, detroit, s, capture, revived, british, discussion, of, creating, of, an, indian, barrier, state, to, ensure, the, security, of, upper, canada, after, his, short, stay, in, the, area, brock, returned, to, the, niagara, frontier, where, he, was, killed, in, action, several, weeks, later, meanwhile, the, british, had, negotiated, a, temporary, armistice, and, called, off, further, offensives, tecumseh, was, frustrated, by, the, unexpected, british, american, armistice, which, came, at, a, time, when, his, confederacy, was, attacking, other, american, forts, and, needed, british, support, in, september, 1812, he, and, roundhead, led, 600, warriors, to, assist, in, an, attack, on, fort, wayne, but, the, siege, failed, before, they, arrived, another, siege, against, fort, harrison, also, failed, tecumseh, stayed, in, the, prophetstown, region, for, the, remainder, of, 1812, coordinating, native, american, war, efforts, i, have, with, me, eight, hundred, braves, you, have, an, equal, number, in, your, hiding, place, come, out, with, them, and, give, me, battle, you, talked, like, a, brave, when, we, met, at, vincennes, and, i, respected, you, but, now, you, hide, behind, logs, and, in, the, earth, like, a, ground, hog, give, me, your, answer, tecumseh, returned, to, amherstburg, in, april, 1813, meanwhile, the, americans, having, suffered, defeat, at, the, battle, of, frenchtown, in, january, 1813, were, pushing, back, toward, detroit, under, the, command, of, william, henry, harrison, tecumseh, and, roundhead, led, about, 1, 200, warriors, to, fort, meigs, a, recently, constructed, american, fort, along, the, maumee, river, in, ohio, the, indians, initially, saw, little, action, while, british, forces, under, general, henry, procter, laid, siege, to, the, fort, fighting, outside, the, fort, began, on, may, 5, after, the, arrival, of, american, reinforcements, who, attacked, the, british, gun, batteries, tecumseh, led, an, attack, on, an, american, sortie, from, the, fort, then, crossed, the, river, to, help, defeat, a, regiment, of, kentucky, militia, the, british, and, native, americans, had, inflicted, heavy, casualties, on, the, americans, outside, the, fort, but, failed, to, capture, it, procter, s, canadian, militia, and, many, of, tecumseh, s, warriors, left, after, the, battle, so, procter, was, compelled, to, lift, the, siege, one, of, the, most, famous, incidents, in, tecumseh, s, life, occurred, after, the, battle, american, prisoners, had, been, taken, to, the, nearby, ruins, of, fort, miami, when, a, group, of, indians, began, killing, prisoners, tecumseh, rushed, in, and, stopped, the, slaughter, according, to, sugden, 1997, tecumseh, s, defense, of, the, american, prisoners, became, a, cornerstone, of, his, legend, the, ultimate, proof, of, his, inherent, nobility, some, accounts, said, tecumseh, rebuked, general, procter, for, failing, to, protect, the, prisoners, though, this, might, not, have, happened, tecumseh, and, procter, returned, to, fort, meigs, in, july, 1813, tecumseh, with, 2, 500, warriors, the, largest, contingent, he, would, ever, lead, they, had, little, hope, of, taking, the, strongly, defended, fort, but, tecumseh, sought, to, draw, the, americans, into, open, battle, he, staged, a, mock, battle, within, earshot, of, the, fort, hoping, the, americans, would, ride, out, to, assist, the, ruse, failed, and, the, second, siege, of, fort, meigs, was, lifted, procter, then, led, a, detachment, to, attack, fort, stephenson, on, the, sandusky, river, while, tecumseh, went, west, to, intercept, potential, american, advances, procter, s, attack, failed, and, the, expedition, returned, to, amherstburg, tecumseh, hoped, further, offensives, were, forthcoming, but, after, the, american, naval, victory, in, the, battle, of, lake, erie, on, september, 10, 1813, procter, decided, to, retreat, from, amherstburg, tecumseh, pleaded, with, procter, to, stay, and, fight, our, lives, are, in, the, hands, of, the, great, spirit, we, are, determined, to, defend, our, lands, and, if, it, is, his, will, we, wish, to, leave, our, bones, upon, them, procter, insisted, the, defense, of, amherstburg, was, untenable, now, that, the, americans, controlled, lake, erie, but, he, promised, to, make, a, stand, at, chatham, along, the, thames, river, tecumseh, reluctantly, agreed, the, british, burned, fort, malden, and, public, buildings, in, amherstburg, then, began, the, retreat, with, william, henry, harrison, s, army, in, pursuit, tecumseh, arrived, at, chatham, to, find, that, procter, had, retreated, even, further, upriver, procter, sent, word, that, he, had, chosen, to, make, a, stand, near, moraviantown, tecumseh, was, angered, by, the, change, in, plans, but, he, led, a, rearguard, action, at, chatham, to, slow, the, american, advance, and, was, slightly, wounded, in, the, arm, many, of, tecumseh, s, despairing, allies, deserted, during, the, retreat, leaving, him, 500, warriors, procter, and, tecumseh, outnumbered, more, than, three, to, one, faced, the, americans, at, the, battle, of, the, thames, on, october, 5, tecumseh, positioned, his, men, in, a, line, of, trees, along, the, right, hoping, to, flank, the, americans, the, left, commanded, by, procter, collapsed, almost, immediately, and, procter, fled, the, battlefield, colonel, richard, mentor, johnson, led, the, american, charge, against, the, indians, tecumseh, was, killed, in, the, fierce, fighting, and, the, indians, dispersed, the, americans, had, won, a, decisive, victory, after, the, battle, american, soldiers, stripped, and, scalped, tecumseh, s, body, the, next, day, when, tecumseh, s, body, had, been, positively, identified, others, peeled, off, some, skin, as, souvenirs, the, location, of, his, remains, is, unknown, the, earliest, account, stated, that, his, body, had, been, taken, by, canadians, and, buried, at, sandwich, later, stories, said, he, was, buried, at, the, battlefield, or, that, his, body, was, secretly, removed, and, buried, elsewhere, according, to, another, tradition, an, ojibwe, named, oshahwahnoo, who, had, fought, at, moraviantown, exhumed, tecumseh, s, body, in, the, 1860s, and, buried, him, on, st, anne, island, on, the, st, clair, river, in, 1931, these, bones, were, examined, tecumseh, had, broken, a, thighbone, in, a, riding, accident, as, a, youth, and, thereafter, walked, with, a, limp, but, neither, thigh, of, this, skeleton, had, been, broken, nevertheless, in, 1941, the, remains, were, buried, on, nearby, walpole, island, in, a, ceremony, honoring, tecumseh, st, denis, 2005, in, a, book, length, investigation, of, the, topic, concluded, that, tecumseh, was, likely, buried, on, the, battlefield, and, his, remains, have, been, lost, initial, published, accounts, identified, richard, mentor, johnson, as, having, killed, tecumseh, in, 1816, another, account, claimed, a, different, soldier, had, fired, the, fatal, shot, the, matter, became, controversial, in, the, 1830s, when, johnson, was, a, candidate, for, vice, president, of, the, united, states, to, martin, van, buren, johnson, s, supporters, promoted, him, as, tecumseh, s, killer, employing, slogans, such, as, rumpsey, dumpsey, rumpsey, dumpsey, colonel, johnson, killed, tecumseh, johnson, s, opponents, collected, testimony, contradicting, this, claim, numerous, other, possibilities, were, named, sugden, 1985, presented, the, evidence, and, argued, that, johnson, s, claim, was, the, strongest, though, not, conclusive, johnson, became, vice, president, in, 1837, his, fame, largely, based, on, his, claim, to, have, killed, tecumseh, tecumseh, s, death, led, to, the, collapse, of, his, confederacy, except, in, the, southern, creek, war, most, of, his, followers, did, little, more, fighting, in, the, negotiations, that, ended, the, war, of, 1812, the, british, attempted, to, honor, promises, made, to, tecumseh, by, insisting, upon, the, creation, of, a, native, american, barrier, state, in, the, old, northwest, the, americans, refused, and, the, matter, was, dropped, the, treaty, of, ghent, 1814, called, for, native, american, lands, to, be, restored, to, their, 1811, boundaries, something, the, united, states, had, no, intention, of, doing, by, the, end, of, the, 1830s, the, u, s, government, had, compelled, shawnees, still, living, in, ohio, to, sign, removal, treaties, and, move, west, of, the, mississippi, river, tecumseh, was, widely, admired, in, his, lifetime, even, by, americans, who, had, fought, against, him, his, primary, american, foe, william, henry, harrison, described, tecumseh, as, one, of, those, uncommon, geniuses, which, spring, up, occasionally, to, produce, revolutions, and, overturn, the, established, order, of, things, after, his, death, he, became, an, iconic, folk, hero, in, american, indigenous, and, canadian, history, for, many, native, americans, in, the, united, states, and, first, nations, people, in, canada, he, became, a, hero, who, transcends, tribal, identity, tecumseh, s, stature, grew, over, the, decades, after, his, death, often, at, the, expense, of, tenskwatawa, whose, religious, views, white, writers, found, alien, and, unappealing, white, writers, tended, to, turn, tecumseh, into, a, secular, leader, who, only, used, his, brother, s, religious, movement, for, political, reasons, for, many, europeans, and, white, north, americans, he, became, the, foremost, example, of, the, noble, savage, stereotype, tecumseh, is, honored, in, canada, as, a, hero, who, played, a, major, role, in, canada, s, defense, in, the, war, of, 1812, joining, sir, isaac, brock, and, laura, secord, as, the, best, remembered, people, of, that, war, john, richardson, an, important, early, canadian, novelist, had, served, with, tecumseh, and, idolized, him, his, 1828, epic, poem, tecumseh, or, the, warrior, of, the, west, was, intended, to, preserve, the, memory, of, one, of, the, noblest, and, most, gallant, spirits, in, history, canadian, writers, such, as, charles, mair, tecumseh, a, drama, 1886, celebrated, tecumseh, as, a, canadian, patriot, an, idea, reflected, in, numerous, subsequent, biographies, written, for, canadian, school, children, the, portrayal, of, tecumseh, as, a, canadian, patriot, has, been, criticized, for, obscuring, his, true, aim, of, protecting, native, homelands, outside, of, canada, among, the, many, things, named, for, tecumseh, in, canada, are, the, naval, reserve, unit, hmcs, tecumseh, and, the, towns, of, tecumseh, in, southwestern, ontario, and, new, tecumseth, in, central, ontario, in, 1931, the, canadian, government, designated, tecumseh, as, a, person, of, national, historic, significance, tecumseh, has, long, been, admired, in, germany, especially, due, to, popular, novels, by, fritz, steuben, beginning, with, the, flying, arrow, 1930, steuben, used, tecumseh, to, promote, nazism, though, later, editions, of, his, novels, removed, the, nazi, elements, an, east, german, film, tecumseh, was, released, in, 1972, in, the, united, states, tecumseh, became, a, legendary, figure, the, historical, details, of, his, life, shrouded, in, mythology, according, to, edmunds, 2007, the, real, tecumseh, has, been, overshadowed, by, a, folk, hero, whose, exploits, combine, the, best, of, fact, and, fiction, only, in, the, late, 20th, century, did, academic, historians, begin, to, unravel, fact, from, fiction, the, fictional, tecumseh, has, been, featured, in, poems, plays, and, novels, movies, and, outdoor, dramas, examples, include, george, jones, s, tecumseh, or, the, prophet, of, the, west, 1844, play, mary, catherine, crowley, s, love, thrives, in,
