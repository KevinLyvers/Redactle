consolidation, of, power, alexander, the, great, had, invaded, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, before, abandoning, his, campaign, in, 324, bce, due, to, a, mutiny, caused, by, the, prospect, of, facing, another, large, empire, presumably, the, nanda, empire, chandragupta, defeated, and, conquered, both, the, nanda, empire, centered, in, pataliputra, magadha, and, the, greek, satraps, that, were, appointed, or, formed, from, alexander, s, empire, in, south, asia, afterwards, chandragupta, expanded, and, secured, his, western, border, where, he, was, confronted, by, seleucus, i, nicator, in, the, seleucid, mauryan, war, after, two, years, of, war, chandragupta, was, considered, to, have, gained, the, upper, hand, in, the, conflict, and, annexed, satrapies, up, to, the, hindu, kush, instead, of, prolonging, the, war, both, parties, settled, on, a, marriage, treaty, chandragupta, s, empire, extended, throughout, most, of, south, asia, spanning, from, modern, day, bengal, to, afghanistan, across, north, india, as, well, as, making, inroads, into, central, and, south, india, in, contrast, to, the, jain, legends, which, developed, 900, years, later, contemporary, greek, evidence, states, that, chandragupta, did, not, give, up, performing, the, rites, of, sacrificing, animals, associated, with, vedic, brahminism, he, delighted, in, hunting, and, otherwise, leading, a, life, remote, from, the, jain, practice, of, ahimsa, or, nonviolence, towards, living, beings, chandragupta, s, reign, and, the, maurya, empire, set, an, era, of, economic, prosperity, reforms, infrastructure, expansions, and, tolerance, many, religions, thrived, within, his, realms, and, his, descendants, empire, buddhism, jainism, and, j, vika, gained, prominence, alongside, vedic, and, brahmanistic, traditions, and, minority, religions, such, as, zoroastrianism, and, the, greek, pantheon, were, respected, a, memorial, for, chandragupta, maurya, exists, on, the, chandragiri, hill, along, with, a, seventh, century, hagiographic, inscription, chandragupta, s, life, and, accomplishments, are, described, in, ancient, and, historical, greek, hindu, buddhist, and, jain, texts, but, they, significantly, vary, in, detail, chandragupta, was, born, about, 340, bc, and, died, at, about, 295, bc, his, main, biographical, sources, in, chronological, order, are, the, greek, and, roman, texts, do, not, mention, chandragupta, directly, except, for, a, second, century, text, written, by, the, roman, historian, justin, they, predominantly, mention, the, last, nanda, emperor, who, usurped, the, throne, of, the, king, before, him, justin, states, that, chandragupta, was, of, humble, origin, and, includes, stories, of, miraculous, legends, associated, with, him, such, as, a, wild, elephant, appearing, and, submitting, itself, to, him, as, a, ride, to, him, before, a, battle, justin, s, text, notes, that, chandragupta, and, chanakya, defeated, and, removed, nanda, from, his, throne, megasthenes, account, as, it, has, survived, in, greek, texts, that, quote, him, states, that, alexander, the, great, and, chandragupta, met, which, if, true, would, mean, his, rule, started, before, 321, bce, he, is, described, as, a, great, king, but, not, as, great, in, power, and, influence, as, porus, in, northwestern, india, or, agrammes, dhana, nanda, in, eastern, india, as, alexander, did, not, cross, the, beas, river, chandragupta, s, territory, probably, included, the, punjab, region, the, pre, 4th, century, hindu, puranic, texts, mostly, mirror, the, greek, sources, these, texts, do, not, discuss, the, details, of, chandragupta, s, ancestry, but, rather, cover, the, ancestry, of, the, last, nanda, king, the, nanda, king, is, described, to, be, cruel, against, dharma, and, shastras, and, born, out, of, an, illicit, relationship, followed, by, a, coup, the, chanakya, s, arthasastra, refers, to, the, nanda, rule, as, against, the, spiritual, cultural, and, military, interests, of, the, country, a, period, where, intrigue, and, vice, multiplied, chanakya, states, that, chandragupta, returned, dharma, nurtured, diversity, of, views, and, ruled, virtuously, that, kindled, love, among, the, subjects, for, his, rule, buddhist, texts, such, as, mahavamsa, describe, chandragupta, to, be, of, kshatriya, origin, these, sources, written, about, seven, centuries, after, his, dynasty, ended, state, that, both, chandragupta, and, his, grandson, ashoka, a, patron, of, buddhism, were, moriyas, a, branch, of, gautama, buddha, s, shakya, noble, family, these, buddhist, sources, attempt, to, link, the, dynasty, of, their, patron, ashoka, directly, to, the, buddha, the, sources, claim, that, the, family, branched, off, to, escape, persecution, from, a, king, of, kosala, and, chandragupta, s, ancestors, moved, into, a, secluded, himalayan, kingdom, known, for, its, peacocks, the, buddhist, sources, explain, the, epithet, maurya, comes, from, these, peacocks, or, mora, in, pali, sanskrit, mayura, the, buddhist, texts, are, inconsistent, some, offer, other, legends, to, explain, his, epithet, for, example, they, mention, a, city, named, moriya, nagara, where, all, buildings, were, made, of, bricks, colored, like, the, peacock, s, neck, the, maha, bodhi, vasa, states, he, hailed, from, moriya, nagara, while, the, digha, nikaya, states, he, came, from, the, maurya, clan, of, pipphalivana, the, buddhist, sources, also, mention, that, brahmin, chanakya, was, his, counselor, and, with, whose, support, chandragupta, became, the, king, at, patliputra, he, has, also, been, variously, identified, with, shashigupta, which, has, same, etymology, as, of, chandragupta, of, paropamisadae, on, the, account, of, same, life, events, the, 12th, century, digambara, text, parishishtaparvan, by, hemachandra, is, the, main, and, earliest, jain, source, of, the, complete, legend, of, chandragupta, it, was, written, nearly, 1, 400, years, after, chandragupta, s, death, canto, 8, verses, 170, to, 469, describes, the, legend, of, chandragupta, and, chanakya, s, influence, on, him, other, digambara, jain, sources, state, he, moved, to, karnataka, after, renouncing, his, kingdom, and, performed, sallekhana, the, jain, religious, ritual, of, peacefully, welcoming, death, by, fasting, the, earliest, mention, of, chandragupta, s, ritual, death, is, found, in, harisena, s, brhatkathakosa, a, sanskrit, text, of, stories, about, digambara, jains, the, brhatkathakosa, describes, the, legend, of, bhadrabahu, and, mentions, chandragupta, in, its, 131st, story, however, the, story, makes, no, mention, of, the, maurya, empire, and, mentions, that, his, disciple, chandragupta, lived, in, and, migrated, from, ujjain, a, kingdom, northwest, madhya, pradesh, about, a, thousand, kilometers, west, of, the, magadha, and, patliputra, central, bihar, this, has, led, to, the, proposal, that, harisena, s, chandragupta, may, be, a, later, era, different, person, none, of, the, ancient, texts, mention, when, chandragupta, was, born, plutarch, claims, that, he, was, a, young, man, when, he, met, alexander, iii, during, the, latter, s, invasion, of, india, c, 326, 325, bce, assuming, the, plutarch, account, is, true, raychaudhuri, proposed, in, 1923, that, chandragupta, may, have, been, born, after, 350, bce, according, to, other, greco, roman, texts, chandragupta, attacked, the, greek, indian, governors, after, alexander, s, death, c, 323, bce, with, seleucus, i, nicator, entering, into, a, treaty, with, chandragupta, years, later, seleucus, nicator, under, this, treaty, gave, up, arachosia, kandahar, gedrosia, makran, and, paropamisadae, kabul, to, chandragupta, in, exchange, for, 500, war, elephants, the, texts, do, not, include, the, start, or, end, year, of, chandragupta, s, reign, according, to, some, hindu, and, buddhist, texts, chandragupta, ruled, for, 24, years, the, buddhist, sources, state, chandragupta, maurya, ruled, 162, years, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, however, the, buddha, s, birth, and, death, vary, by, source, and, all, these, lead, to, a, chronology, that, is, significantly, different, from, the, greco, roman, records, similarly, jain, sources, composed, give, different, gaps, between, mahavira, s, death, and, his, accession, as, with, the, buddha, s, death, the, date, of, mahavira, s, death, itself, is, also, a, matter, of, debate, and, the, inconsistencies, and, lack, of, unanimity, among, the, jain, authors, cast, doubt, on, jain, sources, this, digambara, jain, chronology, also, is, not, reconcilable, with, the, chronology, implied, in, other, indian, and, non, indian, sources, historians, such, as, irfan, habib, and, vivekanand, jha, assign, chandragupta, s, reign, to, c, 322, 298, bce, upinder, singh, dates, his, rule, from, 324, or, 321, bce, to, 297, bce, kristi, wiley, states, he, reigned, between, 320, and, 293, bce, one, medieval, commentator, states, chandragupta, to, be, the, son, of, one, of, the, nanda, s, wives, with, the, name, mura, other, sources, describe, mura, as, a, concubine, of, the, king, another, sanskrit, dramatic, text, mudrarakshasa, uses, the, terms, vrishala, and, kula, hina, meaning, not, descending, from, a, recognized, clan, or, family, to, describe, chandragupta, the, word, vrishala, has, two, meanings, one, is, the, son, of, a, shudra, the, other, means, the, best, of, kings, a, later, commentator, used, the, former, interpretation, to, posit, that, chandragupta, had, a, shudra, background, however, historian, radha, kumud, mukherjee, opposed, this, theory, and, stated, that, the, word, should, be, interpreted, as, the, best, of, kings, the, same, drama, also, refers, to, chandragupta, as, someone, of, humble, origin, like, justin, according, to, the, 11th, century, texts, of, the, kashmiri, hindu, tradition, kathasaritsagara, and, brihat, katha, manjari, the, nanda, lineage, was, very, short, chandragupta, was, a, son, of, purva, nanda, the, older, nanda, based, in, ayodhya, the, common, theme, in, the, hindu, sources, is, that, chandragupta, came, from, a, humble, background, and, with, chanakya, he, emerged, as, a, dharmic, king, loved, by, his, subjects, according, to, the, digambara, legend, by, hemachandra, chanakya, was, a, jain, layperson, and, a, brahmin, when, chanakya, was, born, jain, monks, prophesied, that, chanakya, will, one, day, grow, up, to, help, make, someone, an, emperor, and, will, be, the, power, behind, the, throne, chanakya, believed, in, the, prophecy, and, fulfilled, it, by, agreeing, to, help, the, daughter, of, a, peacock, breeding, community, chief, deliver, a, baby, boy, in, exchange, he, asked, the, mother, to, give, up, the, boy, and, let, him, adopt, him, at, a, later, date, the, jain, brahmin, then, went, about, making, money, through, magic, and, returned, later, to, claim, young, chandragupta, whom, he, taught, and, trained, together, they, recruited, soldiers, and, attacked, the, nanda, empire, eventually, they, won, and, proclaimed, patliputra, as, their, capital, the, buddhist, and, hindu, legends, present, different, versions, of, how, chandragupta, met, chanakya, broadly, they, mention, young, chandragupta, creating, a, mock, game, of, a, royal, court, that, he, and, his, shepherd, friends, played, near, vinjha, forest, chanakya, saw, him, give, orders, to, the, others, bought, him, from, the, hunter, and, adopted, chandragupta, chanakya, taught, and, admitted, him, in, taxila, to, study, the, vedas, military, arts, law, and, other, shastras, after, taxila, chandragupta, and, chanakya, moved, to, pataliputra, the, capital, and, a, historic, learning, center, in, the, eastern, magadha, kingdom, of, india, they, met, nanda, there, according, to, hindu, sources, and, dhana, nanda, according, to, pali, language, buddhist, sources, chandragupta, became, a, commander, of, the, nanda, army, but, according, to, justin, chandragupta, offended, the, nanda, king, nandrum, or, nandrus, who, ordered, his, execution, an, alternative, version, states, that, it, was, the, nanda, king, who, was, publicly, insulted, by, chanakya, chandragupta, and, chanakya, escaped, and, became, rebels, who, planned, to, remove, the, nanda, king, from, power, the, mudrarakshasa, also, states, that, chanakya, swore, to, destroy, the, nanda, dynasty, after, he, felt, insulted, by, the, king, the, roman, text, by, justin, mentions, a, couple, of, miraculous, incidents, that, involved, sandracottus, chandragupta, and, presents, these, legends, as, omens, and, portents, of, his, fate, in, the, first, incident, when, chandragupta, was, asleep, after, having, escaped, from, nandrum, a, big, lion, came, up, to, him, licked, him, and, then, left, in, the, second, incident, when, chandragupta, was, readying, for, war, with, alexander, s, generals, a, huge, wild, elephant, approached, him, and, offered, itself, to, be, his, steed, according, to, the, buddhist, text, mahavamsa, tika, chandragupta, and, chanakya, raised, an, army, by, recruiting, soldiers, from, many, places, after, the, former, completed, his, education, at, taxila, chanakya, made, chandragupta, the, leader, of, the, army, the, digambara, jain, text, parishishtaparvan, states, that, this, army, was, raised, by, chanakya, with, coins, he, minted, and, an, alliance, formed, with, parvataka, according, to, justin, chandragupta, organized, an, army, early, translators, interpreted, justin, s, original, expression, as, body, of, robbers, but, states, raychaudhuri, the, original, expression, used, by, justin, may, mean, mercenary, soldier, hunter, or, robber, greco, roman, writer, plutarch, stated, in, his, life, of, alexander, that, the, nanda, king, was, so, unpopular, that, had, alexander, tried, he, could, have, easily, conquered, india, after, alexander, ended, his, campaign, and, left, chandragupta, s, army, conquered, the, nanda, capital, pataliputra, around, 322, bce, with, chanakya, s, counsel, historically, reliable, details, of, chandragupta, s, campaign, into, pataliputra, are, unavailable, and, the, legends, written, centuries, later, are, inconsistent, buddhist, texts, such, as, milindapanha, claim, magadha, was, ruled, by, the, nanda, dynasty, which, with, chanakya, s, counsel, chandragupta, conquered, to, restore, dhamma, the, army, of, chandragupta, and, chanakya, first, conquered, the, nanda, outer, territories, before, invading, pataliputra, in, contrast, to, the, easy, victory, of, buddhist, sources, the, hindu, and, jain, texts, state, that, the, campaign, was, bitterly, fought, because, the, nanda, dynasty, had, a, powerful, and, well, trained, army, the, conquest, was, fictionalised, in, mudrarakshasa, in, which, chandragupta, is, said, to, have, first, acquired, punjab, and, allied, with, a, local, king, named, parvatka, under, the, chanakya, s, advice, before, advancing, on, the, nanda, empire, chandragupta, laid, siege, to, patliputra, now, patna, the, capital, of, magadha, around, 322, b, c, by, deploying, guerrilla, warfare, methods, with, the, help, of, mercenaries, from, conquered, areas, historian, p, k, bhattacharyya, states, that, the, empire, was, built, by, a, gradual, conquest, of, provinces, after, the, initial, consolidation, of, magadha, according, to, the, digambara, jain, version, by, hemachandra, the, success, of, chandragupta, and, his, strategist, chanakya, was, stopped, by, a, nanda, town, that, refused, to, surrender, chanakya, disguised, himself, as, a, mendicant, and, found, seven, mother, goddesses, saptamatrikas, inside, he, concluded, these, goddesses, were, protecting, the, town, people, the, townspeople, sought, the, disguised, mendicant, s, advice, on, how, to, end, the, blockade, of, the, army, surrounding, their, town, hemacandra, wrote, chanakya, swindled, them, into, removing, the, mother, goddesses, the, townspeople, removed, the, protective, goddesses, and, an, easy, victory, over, the, town, followed, thereafter, the, alliance, of, chandragupta, and, parvataka, overran, the, nanda, empire, and, attacked, pataliputra, with, an, immeasurable, army, with, a, depleted, treasury, exhausted, merit, and, insufficient, intelligence, the, nanda, emperor, lost, these, legends, state, that, the, nanda, emperor, was, defeated, but, allowed, to, leave, pataliputra, alive, with, a, chariot, full, of, items, his, family, needed, the, jain, sources, attest, that, his, daughter, fell, in, love, at, first, sight, with, chandragupta, and, married, him, with, the, defeat, of, nanda, chandragupta, maurya, founded, the, maurya, empire, in, ancient, india, the, indian, campaign, of, alexander, the, great, ended, before, chandragupta, came, into, power, alexander, had, left, india, in, 325, bce, and, assigned, the, northwestern, indian, subcontinent, territories, to, greek, governors, the, nature, of, early, relationship, between, these, governors, and, chandragupta, is, unknown, justin, mentions, chandragupta, as, a, rival, of, the, alexander, s, successors, in, north, western, india, he, states, that, after, alexander, s, death, chandragupta, freed, indian, territories, from, the, greeks, and, executed, some, of, the, governors, according, to, boesche, this, war, with, the, northwestern, territories, was, in, part, fought, by, mercenaries, hired, by, chandragupta, and, chanakya, and, these, wars, may, have, been, the, cause, of, the, demise, of, two, of, alexander, s, governors, nicanor, and, philip, megasthenes, served, as, a, greek, ambassador, in, his, court, for, four, years, according, to, appian, seleucus, i, nicator, one, of, alexander, s, macedonian, generals, who, in, 312, bce, established, the, seleucid, empire, with, its, capital, at, babylon, brought, persia, and, bactria, under, his, own, authority, putting, his, eastern, front, facing, the, empire, of, chandragupta, seleucus, and, chandragupta, waged, war, until, they, came, to, an, understanding, with, each, other, seleucus, married, off, his, daughter, berenice, to, chandragupta, to, forge, an, alliance, r, c, majumdar, and, d, d, kosambi, note, that, seleucus, appeared, to, have, fared, poorly, after, ceding, large, territories, west, of, the, indus, to, chandragupta, the, maurya, empire, added, arachosia, kandahar, gedrosia, balochistan, and, paropamisadae, gandhara, according, to, strabo, seleucus, nicator, gave, these, regions, to, chandragupta, along, with, a, marriage, treaty, and, in, return, received, five, hundred, elephants, the, details, of, the, engagement, treaty, are, not, known, however, since, the, extensive, sources, available, on, seleucus, never, mention, an, indian, princess, it, is, thought, that, the, marital, alliance, went, the, other, way, with, chandragupta, himself, or, his, son, bindusara, marrying, a, seleucid, princess, in, accordance, with, contemporary, greek, practices, to, form, dynastic, alliances, an, indian, puranic, source, the, pratisarga, parva, of, the, bhavishya, purana, described, the, marriage, of, chandragupta, with, a, greek, yavana, princess, daughter, of, seleucus, chandragupta, sent, 500, war, elephants, to, seleucus, which, played, a, key, role, in, seleucus, victory, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, addition, to, this, treaty, seleucus, dispatched, megasthenes, as, an, ambassador, to, chandragupta, s, court, and, later, antiochos, sent, deimakos, to, his, son, bindusara, at, the, maurya, court, at, patna, after, annexing, seleucus, provinces, west, of, the, indus, river, chandragupta, had, a, vast, empire, extending, across, the, northern, indian, sub, continent, from, the, bay, of, bengal, to, the, arabian, sea, chandragupta, began, expanding, his, empire, southwards, beyond, the, vindhya, range, and, into, the, deccan, plateau, by, the, time, his, conquests, were, complete, chandragupta, s, empire, extended, over, most, of, the, subcontinent, two, poetic, anthologies, from, the, tamil, sangam, literature, corpus, akananuru, and, purananuru, allude, to, the, nanda, rule, and, maurya, empire, for, example, poems, 69, 281, and, 375, mention, the, army, and, chariots, of, the, mauryas, while, poems, 251, and, 265, may, be, alluding, to, the, nandas, however, the, poems, dated, between, first, century, bce, to, fifth, century, ce, do, not, mention, chandragupta, maurya, by, name, and, some, of, them, could, be, referring, to, a, different, moriya, dynasty, in, the, deccan, region, in, the, fifth, century, ce, according, to, upinder, singh, these, poems, may, be, mentioning, mokur, and, koshar, kingdoms, of, vadugars, northerners, in, karnataka, and, andhra, pradesh, with, one, interpretation, being, that, the, maurya, empire, had, an, alliance, with, these, at, some, point, of, time, greek, writer, phylarchus, c, third, century, bce, who, is, quoted, by, athenaeus, calls, chandragupta, sandrokoptos, the, later, greco, roman, writers, strabo, arrian, and, justin, c, second, century, call, him, sandrocottus, in, greek, and, latin, accounts, chandragupta, is, known, as, sandrakottos, greek, and, androcottus, greek, the, king, s, epithets, mentioned, in, the, sanskrit, play, mudrarakshasa, include, chanda, siri, chandra, shri, piadamsana, priya, darshana, and, vrishala, piadamsana, is, similar, to, priyadasi, an, epithet, of, his, grandson, ashoka, the, word, vrishala, is, used, in, indian, epics, and, law, books, to, refer, to, non, orthodox, people, according, to, one, theory, it, may, be, derived, from, the, greek, royal, title, basileus, but, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, of, this, the, indian, sources, apply, it, to, several, non, royals, especially, wandering, teachers, and, ascetics, there, are, no, records, of, chandragupta, s, military, conquests, and, the, reach, of, his, empire, it, is, based, on, inferences, from, greek, and, roman, historians, and, the, religious, indian, texts, written, centuries, after, his, death, based, on, these, the, north, west, reach, of, his, empire, included, parts, of, present, day, afghanistan, that, seleucus, i, nicator, ceded, to, him, including, kabul, kandahar, taxila, and, gandhara, these, are, the, areas, where, his, grandson, ashoka, left, the, major, kandahar, rock, edict, and, other, edicts, in, the, greek, and, aramaic, languages, in, the, west, chandragupta, s, rule, over, present, day, gujarat, is, attested, to, by, ashoka, s, inscription, in, junagadh, on, the, same, rock, about, 400, years, later, rudradaman, inscribed, a, longer, text, sometime, about, the, mid, second, century, rudradaman, s, inscription, states, that, the, sudarshana, lake, in, the, area, was, commissioned, during, the, rule, of, chandragupta, through, his, governor, vaishya, pushyagupta, and, conduits, were, added, during, ashoka, s, rule, through, tushaspha, the, mauryan, control, of, the, region, is, further, corroborated, by, the, inscription, on, the, rock, which, suggests, that, chandragupta, controlled, the, malwa, region, in, central, india, located, between, gujarat, and, pataliputra, there, is, uncertainty, about, the, other, conquests, that, chandragupta, may, have, achieved, especially, in, the, deccan, region, of, southern, india, at, the, time, of, his, grandson, ashoka, s, ascension, in, c, 268, bce, the, empire, extended, up, to, present, day, karnataka, in, the, south, so, the, southern, conquests, may, be, attributed, to, either, chandragupta, or, his, son, bindusara, if, the, jain, tradition, about, chandragupta, ending, his, life, as, a, renunciate, in, karnakata, is, considered, correct, it, appears, that, chandragupta, initiated, the, southern, conquest, maurya, with, his, counsellor, chanakya, together, built, one, of, the, largest, empires, ever, on, the, indian, subcontinent, chandragupta, s, empire, extended, from, bengal, to, central, afghanistan, encompassing, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, except, for, parts, that, are, now, tamil, nadu, kerala, and, odisha, after, unifying, much, of, india, chandragupta, and, chanakya, passed, a, series, of, major, economic, and, political, reforms, chandragupta, established, a, strong, central, administration, from, pataliputra, now, patna, chandragupta, applied, the, statecraft, and, economic, policies, described, in, chanakya, s, text, arthashastra, there, are, varying, accounts, in, the, historic, legendary, and, hagiographic, literature, of, various, indian, religions, about, chandragupta, s, rule, but, allchin, and, erdosy, are, suspect, they, state, one, cannot, but, be, struck, by, the, many, close, correspondences, between, the, hindu, arthashastra, and, the, two, other, major, sources, the, buddhist, asokan, inscriptions, and, greek, megasthenes, text, the, maurya, rule, was, a, structured, administration, chandragupta, had, a, council, of, ministers, amatya, with, chanakya, was, his, chief, minister, the, empire, was, organised, into, territories, janapada, centres, of, regional, power, were, protected, with, forts, durga, and, state, operations, were, funded, with, treasury, kosa, strabo, in, his, geographica, composed, about, 300, years, after, chandragupta, s, death, describes, aspects, of, his, rule, in, his, chapter, xv, 46, 69, he, had, councillors, for, matters, of, justice, and, assessors, to, collect, taxes, on, commercial, activity, and, trade, goods, he, routinely, performed, vedic, sacrifices, brahmanical, rituals, and, hosted, major, festivals, marked, by, procession, of, elephants, and, horses, his, officers, inspected, situations, requiring, law, and, order, in, the, cities, the, crime, rate, was, low, according, to, megasthenes, chandragupta, s, rule, was, marked, by, three, parallel, administrative, structures, one, managed, the, affairs, of, villages, ensuring, irrigation, recording, land, ownership, monitoring, tools, supply, enforcing, hunting, wood, products, and, forest, related, laws, and, settling, disputes, another, administrative, structure, managed, city, affairs, including, all, matters, related, to, trade, merchant, activity, visit, of, foreigners, harbors, roads, temples, markets, and, industries, they, also, collected, taxes, and, ensured, standardized, weights, and, measures, the, third, administrative, body, overlooked, the, military, its, training, its, weapons, supply, and, the, needs, of, the, soldiers, chanakya, was, concerned, about, chandragupta, s, safety, and, developed, elaborate, techniques, to, prevent, assassination, attempts, various, sources, report, chandragupta, frequently, changed, bedrooms, to, confuse, conspirators, he, left, his, palace, only, for, certain, tasks, to, go, on, military, expeditions, to, visit, his, court, for, dispensing, justice, to, offer, sacrifices, for, celebrations, and, for, hunting, during, celebrations, he, was, well, guarded, and, on, hunts, he, was, surrounded, by, female, guards, who, were, presumed, to, be, less, likely, to, participate, in, a, coup, conspiracy, these, strategies, may, have, resulted, from, the, historical, context, of, the, nanda, emperor, who, had, come, to, power, by, assassinating, the, previous, emperor, during, chandragupta, s, reign, and, that, of, his, dynasty, many, religions, thrived, in, india, with, buddhism, jainism, and, ajivika, gaining, prominence, along, with, other, folk, traditions, the, empire, built, a, strong, economy, from, a, solid, infrastructure, such, as, irrigation, temples, mines, and, roads, ancient, epigraphical, evidence, suggests, chandragupta, under, counsel, from, chanakya, started, and, completed, many, irrigation, reservoirs, and, networks, across, the, indian, subcontinent, to, ensure, food, supplies, for, the, civilian, population, and, the, army, a, practice, continued, by, his, dynastic, successors, regional, prosperity, in, agriculture, was, one, of, the, required, duties, of, his, state, officials, the, strongest, evidence, of, infrastructure, development, is, found, in, the, junagadh, rock, inscription, of, rudradaman, in, gujarat, dated, to, about, 150, ce, it, states, among, other, things, that, rudradaman, repaired, and, enlarged, the, reservoir, and, irrigation, conduit, infrastructure, built, by, chandragupta, and, enhanced, by, asoka, chandragupta, s, empire, also, built, mines, manufacturing, centres, and, networks, for, trading, goods, his, rule, developed, land, routes, to, transport, goods, across, the, indian, subcontinent, chandragupta, expanded, roads, suitable, for, carts, as, he, preferred, those, over, narrow, tracks, suitable, for, only, pack, animals, according, to, kaushik, roy, the, maurya, dynasty, rulers, were, great, road, builders, the, greek, ambassador, megasthenes, credited, this, tradition, to, chandragupta, after, the, completion, of, a, thousand, mile, long, highway, connecting, chandragupta, s, capital, pataliputra, in, bihar, to, taxila, in, the, north, west, where, he, studied, the, other, major, strategic, road, infrastructure, credited, to, this, tradition, spread, from, pataliputra, in, various, directions, connecting, it, with, nepal, kapilavastu, dehradun, mirzapur, odisha, andhra, and, karnataka, roy, stated, this, network, boosted, trade, and, commerce, and, helped, move, armies, rapidly, and, efficiently, chandragupta, and, chanakya, seeded, weapon, manufacturing, centres, and, kept, them, as, a, state, monopoly, of, the, state, the, state, however, encouraged, competing, private, parties, to, operate, mines, and, supply, these, centres, they, considered, economic, prosperity, essential, to, the, pursuit, of, dharma, virtuous, life, and, adopted, a, policy, of, avoiding, war, with, diplomacy, yet, continuously, preparing, the, army, for, war, to, defend, its, interests, and, other, ideas, in, the, arthashastra, the, evidence, of, arts, and, architecture, during, chandragupta, s, time, is, mostly, limited, to, texts, such, as, those, by, megasthenese, and, kautilya, the, edict, inscriptions, and, carvings, on, monumental, pillars, are, attributed, to, his, grandson, ashoka, the, texts, imply, the, existence, of, cities, public, works, and, prosperous, architecture, but, the, historicity, of, these, is, in, question, archeological, discoveries, in, the, modern, age, such, as, those, didarganj, yakshi, discovered, in, 1917, buried, beneath, the, banks, of, the, ganges, suggest, exceptional, artisanal, accomplishment, the, site, was, dated, to, third, century, bce, by, many, scholars, but, later, dates, such, as, the, kushan, era, 1st, 4th, century, ce, have, also, been, proposed, the, competing, theories, state, that, the, art, linked, to, chandragupta, maurya, s, dynasty, was, learnt, from, the, greeks, and, west, asia, in, the, years, alexander, the, great, waged, war, or, that, these, artifacts, belong, to, an, older, indigenous, indian, tradition, frederick, asher, of, the, university, of, minnesota, says, we, cannot, pretend, to, have, definitive, answers, and, perhaps, as, with, most, art, we, must, recognize, that, there, is, no, single, answer, or, explanation, the, circumstances, and, year, of, chandragupta, s, death, are, unclear, and, disputed, according, to, digambara, jain, accounts, bhadrabahu, forecast, a, 12, year, famine, because, of, all, the, killing, and, violence, during, the, conquests, by, chandragupta, maurya, he, led, a, group, of, jain, monks, to, south, india, where, chandragupta, maurya, joined, him, as, a, monk, after, abdicating, his, kingdom, to, his, son, bindusara, together, states, a, digambara, legend, chandragupta, and, bhadrabahu, moved, to, shravanabelagola, in, present, day, south, karnataka, these, jain, accounts, appeared, in, texts, such, as, brihakath, ko, a, 931, ce, of, harishena, bhadrab, hu, charita, 1450, ce, of, ratnanandi, muniva, sa, bhyudaya, 1680, ce, and, rajavali, kathe, chandragupta, lived, as, an, ascetic, at, shravanabelagola, for, several, years, before, fasting, to, death, as, per, the, practice, of, sallekhana, according, to, the, digambara, legend, in, accordance, with, the, digambara, tradition, the, hill, on, which, chandragupta, is, stated, to, have, performed, asceticism, is, now, known, as, chandragiri, hill, and, digambaras, believe, that, chandragupta, maurya, erected, an, ancient, temple, that, now, survives, as, the, chandragupta, basadi, according, to, roy, chandragupta, s, abdication, of, throne, may, be, dated, to, c, 298, bce, and, his, death, between, 297, bce, and, 293, bce, his, grandson, was, emperor, ashoka, who, is, famed, for, his, historic, pillars, and, his, role, in, helping, spread, buddhism, outside, of,

speaks, of, yatindra, bhadrabahu, and, his, disciple, chandragupta, the, fame, of, whose, penance, spread, into, other, words, along, with, texts, several, digambara, jain, inscriptions, dating, from, the, 7th, 15th, century, refer, to, bhadrabahu, and, a, prabhacandra, later, digambara, tradition, identified, the, prabhacandra, as, chandragupta, and, some, modern, era, scholars, have, accepted, this, digambara, tradition, while, others, have, not, several, of, the, late, digambara, inscriptions, and, texts, in, karnataka, state, the, journey, started, from, ujjain, and, not, patliputra, as, stated, in, some, digambara, texts, jeffery, d, long, a, scholar, of, jain, and, hindu, studies, says, in, one, digambara, version, it, was, samprati, chandragupta, who, renounced, migrated, and, performed, sallekhana, in, shravanabelagola, long, states, scholars, attribute, the, disintegration, of, the, maurya, empire, to, the, times, and, actions, of, samprati, chandragupta, the, grandson, of, ashoka, and, great, great, grandson, of, chandragupta, maurya, the, two, chandraguptas, have, been, confused, to, be, the, same, in, some, digambara, legends, scholar, of, jain, studies, and, sanskrit, paul, dundas, says, the, svetambara, tradition, of, jainism, disputes, the, ancient, digambara, legends, according, to, a, fifth, century, text, of, the, svetambara, jains, the, digambara, sect, of, jainism, was, founded, 609, years, after, mahavira, s, death, or, in, first, century, ce, digambaras, wrote, their, own, versions, and, legends, after, the, fifth, century, with, their, first, expanded, digambara, version, of, sectarian, split, within, jainism, appearing, in, the, tenth, century, the, svetambaras, texts, describe, bhadrabahu, was, based, near, nepalese, foothills, of, the, himalayas, in, third, century, bce, who, neither, moved, nor, travelled, with, chandragupta, maurya, to, the, south, rather, he, died, near, patliputra, according, to, the, svetambara, jains, the, 12th, century, svetambara, jain, legend, by, hemachandra, presents, a, different, picture, the, hemachandra, version, includes, stories, about, jain, monks, who, could, become, invisible, to, steal, food, from, imperial, storage, and, the, jain, brahmin, chanakya, using, violence, and, cunning, tactics, to, expand, chandragupta, s, empire, and, increase, imperial, revenues, it, states, in, verses, 8, 415, to, 8, 435, that, for, 15, years, as, emperor, chandragupta, was, a, follower, of, non, jain, ascetics, with, the, wrong, view, of, religion, and, lusted, for, women, chanakya, who, was, a, jain, convert, himself, persuaded, chandragupta, to, convert, to, jainism, by, showing, that, jain, ascetics, avoided, women, and, focused, on, their, religion, the, legend, mentions, chanakya, aiding, the, premature, birth, of, bindusara, it, states, in, verse, 8, 444, that, chandragupta, died, in, meditation, can, possibly, be, sallekhana, and, went, to, heaven, according, to, hemachandra, s, legend, chanakya, also, performed, sallekhana, according, to, v, r, ramachandra, dikshitar, an, indologist, and, historian, several, of, the, digambara, legends, mention, prabhacandra, who, had, been, misidentified, as, chandragupta, maurya, particularly, after, the, original, publication, on, shravanabelagola, epigraphy, by, b, lewis, rice, the, earliest, and, most, important, inscriptions, mention, prabhacandra, which, rice, presumed, may, have, been, the, clerical, name, assumed, by, chadragupta, maurya, after, he, renounced, and, moved, with, bhadrabahu, from, patliputra, dikshitar, stated, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, this, and, prabhacandra, was, an, important, jain, monk, scholar, who, migrated, centuries, after, chandragupta, maurya, s, death, other, scholars, have, taken, rice, s, deduction, of, chandragupta, maurya, retiring, and, dying, in, shravanabelagola, as, the, working, hypothesis, since, no, alternative, historical, information, or, evidence, is, available, about, chandragupta, s, final, years, and, death, according, to, historian, sushma, jansari, a, closer, look, at, the, evidence, for, chandragupta, s, conversion, to, jainism, and, his, and, bhadrab, hu, s, association, with, rava, a, be, go, a, reveals, that, it, is, both, late, and, problematic, in, addition, except, for, jain, sources, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, view, of, chandragupta, s, conversion, and, migration, jansari, concludes, overall, therefore, the, evidence, as, it, currently, stands, suggests, that, the, story, of, chandragupta, s, conversion, to, jainism, and, abdication, if, indeed, he, did, abdicate, his, migration, southwards, and, his, association, or, otherwise, with, bhadrab, hu, and, the, site, of, rava, a, be, go, a, developed, after, c, 600, ad, a, memorial, to, chandragupta, maurya, exists, on, chandragiri, hill, in, shravanabelagola, karnataka, the, indian, postal, service, issued, a, commemorative, postage,
