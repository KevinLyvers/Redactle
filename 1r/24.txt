oriental, in, chicago, another, is, that, the, girls, chose, the, surname, after, drama, critic, robert, garland, garland, s, daughter, lorna, luft, stated, that, her, mother, selected, the, name, when, jessel, announced, that, the, trio, looked, prettier, than, a, garland, of, flowers, a, tv, special, was, filmed, in, hollywood, at, the, pantages, theatre, premiere, of, a, star, is, born, on, september, 29, 1954, in, which, jessel, stated, i, think, that, i, ought, to, tell, the, folks, that, it, was, i, who, named, judy, garland, judy, garland, not, that, it, would, have, made, any, difference, you, couldn, t, have, hid, that, great, talent, if, you, d, called, her, tel, aviv, windsor, shell, you, know, but, her, name, when, i, first, met, her, was, frances, gumm, and, it, wasn, t, the, kind, of, a, name, that, so, sensitive, a, great, actress, like, that, should, have, and, so, we, called, her, judy, garland, and, i, think, she, s, a, combination, of, helen, hayes, and, al, jolson, and, maybe, jenny, lind, and, sarah, bernhardt, a, later, explanation, surfaced, when, jessel, was, a, guest, on, garland, s, television, show, in, 1963, he, said, that, he, had, sent, actress, judith, anderson, a, telegram, containing, the, word, garland, and, it, stuck, in, his, mind, however, garland, asked, jessel, just, moments, later, if, this, story, was, true, and, he, blithely, replied, no, by, late, 1934, the, gumm, sisters, had, changed, their, name, to, the, garland, sisters, frances, changed, her, name, to, judy, soon, after, inspired, by, a, popular, hoagy, carmichael, song, the, group, broke, up, by, august, 1935, when, mary, jane, suzanne, garland, flew, to, reno, nevada, and, married, musician, lee, kahn, a, member, of, the, jimmy, davis, orchestra,

signed, garland, to, a, contract, with, mgm, presumably, without, a, screen, test, though, she, had, made, a, test, for, the, studio, several, months, earlier, the, studio, did, not, know, what, to, do, with, her, aged, thirteen, she, was, older, than, the, traditional, child, star, but, too, young, for, adult, roles, her, physical, appearance, was, a, dilemma, for, mgm, she, was, only, 4, ft, 11, 1, 2, in, 151, cm, and, her, cute, or, girl, next, door, looks, did, not, exemplify, the, glamorous, persona, then, required, of, leading, female, performers, she, was, self, conscious, and, anxious, about, her, appearance, garland, went, to, school, at, metro, with, ava, gardner, lana, turner, elizabeth, taylor, real, beauties, said, charles, walters, who, directed, her, in, a, number, of, films, judy, was, the, big, money, maker, at, the, time, a, big, success, but, she, was, the, ugly, duckling, i, think, it, had, a, very, damaging, effect, on, her, emotionally, for, a, long, time, i, think, it, lasted, forever, really, her, insecurity, was, exacerbated, by, the, attitude, of, studio, chief, mayer, who, referred, to, her, as, his, little, hunchback, during, her, early, years, at, the, studio, she, was, photographed, and, dressed, in, plain, garments, or, frilly, juvenile, gowns, and, costumes, to, match, the, girl, next, door, image, created, for, her, they, had, her, wear, removable, caps, on, her, teeth, and, rubberized, discs, to, reshape, her, nose, on, november, 16, 1935, 13, year, old, garland, was, in, the, midst, of, preparing, for, a, radio,

died, the, following, morning, at, age, 49, leaving, her, devastated, her, song, for, the, shell, chateau, hour, was, her, first, professional, rendition, of, zing, went, the, strings, of, my, heart, a, song, that, became, a, standard, in, many, of, her, concerts, garland, performed, at, various, studio, functions, and, was, eventually, cast, opposite, deanna, durbin, in, the, musical, short, every, sunday, 1936, the, film, contrasted, her, vocal, range, and, swing, style, with, durbin, s, operatic, soprano, and, served, as, an, extended, screen, test, for, them, as, studio, executives, were, questioning, the, wisdom, of, having, two, girl, singers, on, the, roster, garland, s, first, feature, length, film, was, a, loan, out, to, fox, titled, pigskin, parade, a, football, themed, musical, comedy, where, she, was, billed, tenth, after, stuart, erwin, jack, haley, patsy, kelly, betty, grable, and, others, garland, sang, three, solos, including, the, texas, tornado, and, the, balboa, garland, came, to, the, attention, of, studio, executives, when, she, sang, a, special, arrangement, of, you, made, me, love, you, i, didn, t, want, to, do, it, to, clark, gable, at, a, birthday, party, that, the, studio, arranged, for, the, actor, her, rendition, was, so, well, regarded, that, she, performed, the, song, in, the, all, star, extravaganza, broadway, melody, of, 1938, 1937, when, she, sang, to, a, photograph, of, him, mgm, hit, a, winning, formula, when, it, paired, garland, with, mickey, rooney, in, a, string, of, what, were, known, as, backyard, musicals, the, duo, first, appeared, together, as, supporting, characters, in, the, b, movie, thoroughbreds, don, t, cry, 1937, garland, was, then, cast, in, the, fourth, of, the, hardy, family, movies, love, finds, andy, hardy, 1938, as, a, literal, girl, next, door, to, rooney, s, character, andy, hardy, although, hardy, s, love, interest, was, played, by, lana, turner, they, teamed, as, lead, characters, for, the, first, time, in, babes, in, arms, 1939, ultimately, appearing, in, five, additional, films, including, hardy, films, andy, hardy, meets, debutante, 1940, and, life, begins, for, andy, hardy, 1941, garland, stated, that, she, rooney, and, other, young, performers, were, constantly, prescribed, amphetamines, to, stay, awake, and, keep, up, with, the, frantic, pace, of, making, one, film, after, another, they, were, also, given, barbiturates, to, take, before, going, to, bed, so, they, could, sleep, this, regular, use, of, drugs, she, said, led, to, addiction, and, a, life, long, struggle, she, later, resented, the, hectic, schedule, and, believed, mgm, stole, her, youth, rooney, however, denied, their, studio, was, responsible, for, her, addiction, judy, garland, was, never, given, any, drugs, by, metro, goldwyn, mayer, mr, mayer, didn, t, sanction, anything, for, judy, no, one, on, that, lot, was, responsible, for, judy, garland, s, death, unfortunately, judy, chose, that, path, garland, s, weight, was, within, a, healthy, range, but, the, studio, demanded, she, constantly, diet, they, even, went, so, far, as, to, serve, her, only, a, bowl, of, soup, and, a, plate, of, lettuce, when, she, ordered, a, regular, meal, she, was, plagued, with, self, doubt, throughout, her, life, despite, successful, film, and, recording, careers, awards, critical, praise, and, her, ability, to, fill, concert, halls, worldwide, she, required, constant, reassurance, that, she, was, talented, and, attractive, in, 1938, when, garland, was, sixteen, she, was, cast, as, dorothy, gale, in, the, wizard, of, oz, 1939, a, film, based, on, the, 1900, children, s, book, by, l, frank, baum, in, the, film, she, sang, the, song, with, which, she, would, be, constantly, identified, afterward, over, the, rainbow, although, producers, arthur, freed, and, mervyn, leroy, had, wanted, to, cast, her, in, the, role, from, the, beginning, studio, chief, mayer, first, tried, to, borrow, shirley, temple, from, 20th, century, fox, but, they, declined, deanna, durbin, was, then, asked, but, was, unavailable, this, resulted, in, garland, being, cast, garland, was, initially, outfitted, in, a, blonde, wig, for, the, part, but, freed, and, leroy, decided, against, it, shortly, into, filming, her, blue, gingham, dress, was, chosen, for, its, blurring, effect, on, her, figure, which, made, her, look, younger, shooting, commenced, on, october, 13, 1938, and, it, was, completed, on, march, 16, 1939, with, a, final, cost, of, more, than, 2, million, equivalent, to, 34, million, in, 2023, with, the, conclusion, of, filming, mgm, kept, garland, busy, with, promotional, tours, and, the, shooting, of, babes, in, arms, also, 1939, directed, by, busby, berkeley, she, and, rooney, were, sent, on, a, cross, country, promotional, tour, culminating, in, the, august, 17, new, york, city, premiere, at, the, capitol, theater, which, included, a, five, show, a, day, appearance, schedule, for, the, two, stars, garland, was, reportedly, put, on, a, diet, consisting, of, cigarettes, chicken, soup, and, coffee, during, filming, in, a, further, attempt, to, minimize, her, curves, this, may, be, erroneous, as, historians, jay, scarfone, and, william, stillman, clarify, that, at, the, time, garland, was, an, anti, smoker, and, was, allowed, solid, food, however, her, diet, was, accompanied, by, swimming, and, hiking, outings, plus, games, of, tennis, and, badminton, with, her, stunt, double, bobbie, koshay, the, wizard, of, oz, was, a, tremendous, critical, success, though, its, high, budget, and, estimated, promotion, costs, of, 4, million, equivalent, to, 69, million, in, 2023, coupled, with, the, lower, revenue, that, was, generated, by, discounted, children, s, tickets, meant, that, the, film, did, not, return, a, profit, until, it, was, re, released, in, the, 1940s, and, on, subsequent, occasions, at, the, 1939, academy, awards, ceremony, garland, received, her, only, academy, award, an, academy, juvenile, award, for, her, performances, in, 1939, including, the, wizard, of, oz, and, babes, in, arms, she, was, the, fourth, person, to,

adult, role, a, dual, role, of, both, mother, and, daughter, little, nellie, kelly, was, purchased, from, george, m, cohan, as, a, vehicle, for, her, to, display, both, her, audience, appeal, and, her, physical, appearance, the, role, was, a, challenge, for, her, requiring, the, use, of, an, accent, her, first, adult, kiss, and, the, only, death, scene, of, her, career, her, co, star, george, murphy, regarded, the, kiss, as, embarrassing, he, said, it, felt, like, a, hillbilly, with, a, child, bride, during, that, time, garland, was, still, in, her, teens, when, she, experienced, her, first, serious, adult, romance, with, bandleader, artie, shaw, she, was, deeply, devoted, to, him, and, was, devastated, in, early, 1940, when, he, eloped, with, lana, turner, garland, began, a, relationship, with, musician, david, rose, and, on, her, 18th, birthday, he, gave, her, an, engagement, ring, the, studio, intervened, because, at, the, time, he, was, still, married, to, actress,

gowns, her, lightened, hair, was, also, pulled, up, in, a, stylish, fashion, however, no, matter, how, glamorous, or, beautiful, she, appeared, on, screen, or, in, photographs, she, was, never, confident, about, her, appearance, and, never, escaped, the, girl, next, door, image, that, the, studio, had, created, for, her, one, of, garland, s, most, successful, films, for, mgm, was, meet, me,

removing, her, nose, discs, and, dental, caps, she, appreciated, the, results, so, much, that, ponedel, was, written, into, her, contract, for, all, her, remaining, pictures, at, mgm, around, the, same, time, garland, had, a, brief, affair, with, actor, and, film, director, orson, welles, who, was, then, married, to, actress, rita, hayworth, garland, and, welles, ended, the, affair, in, early, 1945, but, remained, on, good, terms, afterwards, during, the, filming, of, meet, me, in, st, louis, garland, and, minnelli, had, some, initial, conflicts, but, they, entered, into, a, relationship,

which, did, not, make, a, profit, since, garland, had, starred, in, the, wizard, of, oz, the, main, reasons, for, its, failure, were, not, only, its, cost, but, also, included, the, increasing, expense, of, the, shooting, delays, while, garland, was, ill, as, well, as, the, general, public, s, unwillingness, to, accept, her, in, a, sophisticated, film, following, her, work, on, the, pirate,

earlier, judy, s, great, gift, mason, said, in, his, eulogy, was, that, she, could, wring, tears, out, of, hearts, of, rock, she, gave, so, richly, and, so, generously, that, there, was, no, currency, in, which, to, repay, her, the, public, and, press, were, barred, she, was, interred, in, a, crypt, in, the, community, mausoleum, at, ferncliff, cemetery, in, hartsdale, new, york, a, town, 24,

years, of, criminal, mismanagement, of, her, financial, affairs, by, her, representatives, and, staff, along, with, her, generosity, toward, her, family, and, various, causes, resulted, in, her, poor, financial, situation, at, the, end, of, her, life, in, her, last, will, signed, and, sealed, in, early, 1961, garland, made, many, generous, bequests, that, could, not, be, fulfilled, because, her,

of, garland, s, personal, items, was, auctioned, off, by, her, ex, husband, sidney, luft, with, the, support, of, their, daughter, lorna, and, their, son, joey, almost, 500, items, ranging, from,

los, angeles, garland, possessed, a, contralto, singing, voice, described, as, brassy, powerful, effortless, and, resonant, often, demonstrating, a, tremulous, powerful, vibrato, although, her, range, was, comparatively, small, garland, was, capable, of, alternating, between, female, and, male, sounding, timbres, with, little, effort, the, richmond, times, dispatch, correspondent, tony, farrell, wrote, she, possessed, a, deep, velvety, contralto, voice, that, could, turn, on, a, dime, to, belt, out, the, high, notes, ron, o, brien, producer, of, tribute, album, the, definitive, collection, judy, garland, 2006, wrote, the, singer, s, combination, of, natural, phrasing, elegant, delivery, mature, pathos, and, powerful, dramatic, dynamics, she, brings, to, songs, make, her, the, definitive, interpretations, the, huffington, post, writer, joan, e, dowlin, called, the, period, of, garland, s, music, career, between, 1937, and, 1945, the, innocent, years, during, which, the, critic, believes, the, singer, s, voice, was, vibrant, and, her, musical, expression, exuberant, taking, note, of, its, resonance, and, distinct, rich, yet, sweet, quality, that, grabs, you, and, pulls, you, in, garland, s, voice, would, often, vary, to, suit, the, song, she, was, interpreting, ranging, from, soft, engaging, and, tender, during, ballads, to, humorous, on, some, of, her, duets, with, other, artists, her, more, joyful, belted, performances, have, been, compared, to, entertainers, sophie, tucker, ethel, merman, and, al, jolson, although, her, musical, repertoire, consisted, largely, of, cast, recordings, show, tunes, and, traditional, pop, standards, garland, was, also, capable, of, singing, soul, blues, and, jazz, music, which, dowlin, compared, to, singer, elvis, presley, garland, always, claimed, that, her, talent, as, a, performer, was, inherited, saying, nobody, ever, taught, me, what, to, do, onstage, critics, agree, that, even, when, she, debuted, as, a, child, garland, had, always, sounded, mature, for, her, age, particularly, on, her, earlier, recordings, from, an, early, age, garland, had, been, billed, as, the, little, girl, with, the, leather, lungs, a, designation, the, singer, later, admitted, to, having, felt, humiliated, by, because, she, would, have, much, preferred, to, have, been, known, to, audiences, as, a, pretty, or, nice, little, girl, jessel, recalled, that, even, at, only, 12, years, old, garland, s, singing, voice, resembled, that, of, a, woman, with, a, heart, that, had, been, hurt, the, kansas, city, star, contributor, robert, trussel, cited, garland, s, singing, voice, among, the, reasons, why, her, role, in, the, wizard, of, oz, remains, memorable, writing, that, although, she, might, have, been, made, up, and, costumed, to, look, like, a, little, girl, she, didn, t, sing, like, one, due, to, her, powerful, contralto, command, attention, camille, paglia, writing, for, the, new, york, times, joked, that, even, in, garland, s, adult, life, her, petite, frame, literally, throbbed, with, her, huge, voice, making, it, appear, as, though, she, were, at, war, with, her, own, body, musical, theater, actress, and, director, donna, thomason, opined, that, garland, was, an, effective, performer, because, of, her, ability, to, make, her, singing, voice, a, natural, extension, of, speaking, voice, an, asset, that, thomason, believed, all, musical, theater, actors, should, at, least, strive, to, achieve, trussel, agreed, that, garland, s, singing, voice, sounded, utterly, natural, it, never, seemed, forced, or, overly, trained, writing, for, turner, classic, movies, biographer, jonathan, riggs, observed, that, garland, had, a, tendency, to, imbue, her, vocals, with, a, paradoxical, combination, of, fragility, and, resilience, that, eventually, became, a, signature, trademark, of, hers, this, signature, style, of, her, performances, used, to, be, marked, with, power, in, her, voice, pronounced, enunciation, and, projecting, a, sense, of, vulnerability, through, her, singing, and, body, language, michael, bronski, writes, in, his, book, culture, clash, there, was, a, hurt, in, her, voice, and, an, immediacy, to, her, performance, that, gave, the, impression, that, it, was, her, pain, louis, bayard, of, the, washington, post, described, garland, s, voice, as, throbbing, believing, it, to, be, capable, of, connect, with, in, a, way, no, other, voice, does, bayard, also, believes, that, listeners, find, it, hard, to, disentwine, the, sorrow, in, her, voice, from, the, sorrow, that, dogged, her, life, while, dowlin, argued, that, listening, to, judy, sing, makes, me, forget, all, of, the, angst, and, suffering, she, must, have, endured, the, new, york, times, obituarist, in, 1969, observed, that, garland, whether, intentionally, or, not, brought, with, her, all, the, well, publicized, phantoms, of, her, emotional, breakdown, her, career, collapses, and, comebacks, on, stage, during, later, performances, the, same, writer, said, that, garland, s, voice, changed, and, lost, some, of, its, quality, as, she, aged, although, she, retained, much, of, her, personality, contributing, to, the, irish, independent, julia, molony, observed, garland, s, voice, although, still, rich, with, emotion, had, finally, begun, to, creak, with, the, weight, of, years, of, disappointment, and, hard, living, by, the, time, she, performed, at, carnegie, hall, in, 1961, similarly, the, live, record, s, entry, in, the, library, of, congress, wrote, that, while, her, voice, was, still, strong, it, had, also, gained, a, bit, of, heft, and, a, bit, of, wear, author, cary, o, dell, believes, garland, s, rasp, and, occasional, quiver, only, upped, the, emotional, quotient, of, many, of, her, numbers, particularly, on, her, signature, songs, over, the, rainbow, and, the, man, that, got, away, garland, stated, that, she, always, felt, most, safe, and, at, home, while, performing, onstage, regardless, of, the, condition, of, her, voice, her, musical, talent, has, been, commended, by, her, peers, opera, singer, maria, callas, once, said, that, garland, possessed, the, most, superb, voice, she, had, ever, heard, while, singer, and, actor, bing, crosby, said, that, no, other, singer, could, be, compared, to, her, when, garland, was, rested, garland, was, known, for, interacting, with, her, audiences, during, live, performances, the, new, york, times, obituarist, wrote, that, garland, possessed, a, seemingly, unquenchable, need, for, her, audiences, to, respond, with, acclaim, and, affection, and, often, they, did, screaming, we, love, you, judy, we, love, you, garland, herself, explained, in, 1961, a, really, great, reception, makes, me, feel, like, i, have, a, great, big, warm, heating, pad, all, over, me, i, truly, have, a, great, love, for, an, audience, and, i, used, to, want, to, prove, it, to, them, by, giving, them, blood, but, i, have, a, funny, new, thing, now, a, real, determination, to, make, people, enjoy, the, show, the, new, york, times, writer, described, her, as, both, an, instinctive, actress, and, comedienne, the, anonymous, contributor, commented, that, garland, s, performance, style, resembled, that, of, a, music, hall, performer, in, an, era, when, music, halls, were, obsolete, close, friends, of, garland, s, insisted, that, she, never, truly, wanted, to, be, a, movie, star, and, would, have, much, rather, devoted, her, career, entirely, to, singing, and, recording, records, allmusic, biographer, william, ruhlmann, believes, that, garland, s, ability, to, maintain, a, successful, career, as, a, recording, artist, even, after, her, film, appearances, became, less, frequent, was, unusual, for, an, artist, at, the, time, garland, has, been, identified, as, a, triple, threat, due, to, her, ability, to, sing, act, and, dance, arguably, equally, well, doug, strassler, a, critic, for, the, new, york, press, described, garland, as, a, triple, threat, who, bounced, between, family, musicals, and, adult, dramas, with, a, precision, and, a, talent, that, remains, largely, unmatched, in, terms, of, acting, peter, lennon, writing, for, the, guardian, in, 1999, identified, garland, as, a, chameleon, due, to, her, ability, to, alternate, between, comedic, musical, and, dramatic, roles, citing, the, wizard, of, oz, the, clock, a, star, is, born, and, i, could, go, on, singing, her, final, film, role, as, prominent, examples, michael, musto, a, journalist, for, w, magazine, wrote, that, in, her, film, roles, garland, could, project, decency, vulnerability, and, spunk, like, no, other, star, and, she, wrapped, it, up, with, a, tremulously, beautiful, vocal, delivery, that, could, melt, even, the, most, hardened, troll, selected, studio, albums, garland, was, nearly, as, famous, for, her, personal, struggles, in, everyday, life, as, she, was, for, her, entertainment, career, she, has, been, closely, associated, with, her, carefully, cultivated, girl, next, door, image, early, in, her, career, during, the, 1930s, garland, s, public, image, had, earned, her, the, title, america, s, favorite, kid, sister, as, well, as, the, title, little, miss, showbusiness, in, a, review, for, the, star, tribune, graydon, royce, wrote, that, garland, s, public, image, remained, that, of, a, midwestern, girl, who, couldn, t, believe, where, she, was, despite, having, been, a, well, established, celebrity, for, over, 20, years, royce, believes, that, fans, and, audiences, insisted, on, preserving, their, memory, of, garland, as, dorothy, no, matter, how, much, she, matured, calling, her, a, captive, not, of, her, own, desire, to, stay, young, but, a, captive, of, the, public, s, desire, to, preserve, her, that, way, thus, the, studio, continued, to, cast, garland, in, roles, that, were, significantly, younger, than, her, actual, age, according, to, malony, garland, was, one, of, hollywood, s, hardest, working, performers, during, the, 1940s, which, malony, claims, she, used, as, a, coping, mechanism, after, her, first, marriage, imploded, however, studio, employees, recall, that, garland, had, a, tendency, to, be, quite, intense, headstrong, and, volatile, judy, garland, the, secret, life, of, an, american, legend, author, david, shipman, claims, that, several, individuals, were, frustrated, by, garland, s, narcissism, and, growing, instability, while, millions, of, fans, found, her, public, demeanor, and, psychological, state, to, be, fragile, appearing, neurotic, in, interviews, mgm, reports, that, garland, was, consistently, tardy, and, demonstrated, erratic, behavior, which, resulted, in, several, delays, and, disruptions, to, filming, schedules, until, she, was, finally, dismissed, from, the, studio, which, had, deemed, her, unreliable, and, difficult, to, manage, farrell, called, garland, a, grab, bag, of, contradictions, which, has, always, been, a, feast, for, the, american, imagination, describing, her, public, persona, as, awkward, yet, direct, bashful, yet, brash, describing, the, singer, as, tender, and, endearing, yet, savage, and, turbulent, paglia, wrote, that, garland, cut, a, path, of, destruction, through, many, lives, and, out, of, that, chaos, she, made, art, of, still, searing, intensity, calling, her, a, creature, of, extremes, greedy, sensual, and, demanding, gluttonous, for, pleasure, and, pain, paglia, also, compared, garland, to, entertainer, frank, sinatra, due, to, their, shared, emblematic, personality, into, whom, the, mass, audience, projected, its, hopes, and, disappointments, while, observing, that, she, lacked, sinatra, s, survival, skills, despite, her, success, as, a, performer, garland, suffered, from, low, self, esteem, particularly, with, regard, to, her, weight, which, she, constantly, dieted, to, maintain, at, the, behest, of, the, studio, and, mayer, critics, and, historians, believe, this, was, a, result, of, having, been, told, that, she, was, an, ugly, duckling, by, studio, executives, entertainment, weekly, columnist, gene, lyons, observed, that, both, audiences, and, fellow, members, of, the, entertainment, industry, tended, either, to, love, her, or, to, hate, her, at, one, point, stevie, phillips, who, had, worked, as, an, agent, for, garland, for, four, years, described, her, client, as, a, demented, demanding, supremely, talented, drug, addict, royce, argues, that, garland, maintained, astonishing, strength, and, courage, even, during, difficult, times, english, actor, dirk, bogarde, once, called, garland, the, funniest, woman, i, have, ever, met, ruhlmann, wrote, that, the, singer, s, personal, life, contrasted, so, starkly, with, the, exuberance, and, innocence, of, her, film, roles, despite, her, personal, struggles, garland, disagreed, with, the, public, s, opinion, that, she, was, a, tragic, figure, her, younger, daughter, lorna, agreed, that, garland, hated, being, referred, to, as, a, tragic, figure, explaining, we, all, have, tragedies, in, our, lives, but, that, does, not, make, us, tragic, she, was, funny, and, she, was, warm, and, she, was, wonderfully, gifted, she, had, great, highs, and, great, moments, in, her, career, she, also, had, great, moments, in, her, personal, life, yes, we, lost, her, at, 47, years, old, that, was, tragic, but, she, was, not, a, tragic, figure, ruhlmann, argues, that, garland, actually, used, the, public, s, opinion, of, her, tragic, image, to, her, advantage, towards, the, end, of, her, career, by, the, time, of, her, death, in, 1969, garland, had, appeared, in, more, than, 35, films, she, has, been, called, one, of, the, greats, of, entertainment, and, her, reputation, has, endured, in, 1992, gerald, clarke, of, architectural, digest, dubbed, garland, probably, the, greatest, american, entertainer, of, the, twentieth, century, o,

huffington, post, contributor, joan, e, dowlin, concluded, that, garland, possessed, a, distinct, it, quality, by, exemplif, the, star, quality, of, charisma, musical, talent, natural, acting, ability, and, despite, what, the, studio, honchos, said, good, looks, even, if, they, were, the, girl, next, door, looks, allmusic, s, biographer, william, ruhlmann, said, that, the, core, of, her, significance, as, an, artist, remains, her, amazing, voice, and, emotional, commitment, to, her, songs, and, believes, that, her, career, is, sometimes, viewed, more, as, an, object, lesson, in, hollywood, excess, than, as, the, remarkable, string, of, multimedia, accomplishments, it, was, in, 2012, strassler, described, garland, as, more, than, an, icon, like, charlie, chaplin, and, lucille, ball, she, created, a, template, that, the, powers, that, be, have, forever, been, trying, with, varied, levels, of, success, to, replicate, garland, s, live, performances, towards, the, end, of, her,
