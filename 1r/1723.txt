william, harvey, 1, april, 1578, 3, june, 1657, was, an, english, physician, who, made, influential, contributions, in, anatomy, and, physiology, he, was, the, first, known, physician, to, describe, completely, and, in, detail, the, systemic, circulation, and, properties, of, blood, being, pumped, to, the, brain, and, the, rest, of, the, body, by, the, heart, though, earlier, writers, such, as, realdo, colombo, michael, servetus, and, jacques, dubois, had, provided, precursors, of, the, theory, william, s, father, thomas, harvey, was, a, jurat, of, folkestone, where, he, served, as, mayor, in, 1600, records, and, personal, descriptions, delineate, him, as, an, overall, calm, diligent, and, intelligent, man, whose, sons, revered, consulted, and, implicitly, trusted, in, him, they, made, their, father, the, treasurer, of, their, wealth, when, they, acquired, great, estates, he, kept, employed, and, improved, their, gainings, to, their, great, advantage, thomas, harvey, s, portrait, can, still, be, seen, in, the, central, panel, of, a, wall, of, the, dining, room, at, rolls, park, chigwell, in, essex, william, was, the, eldest, of, nine, children, seven, sons, and, two, daughters, of, thomas, and, his, wife, joan, halke, notable, family, connections, include, heneage, finch, 1st, earl, of, nottingham, who, married, william, s, niece, elizabeth, harvey, and, the, diplomat, sir, daniel, harvey, his, great, nephew, was, the, naval, hero, eliab, harvey, captain, of, hms, temeraire, harvey, s, initial, education, was, carried, out, in, folkestone, where, he, learned, latin, he, then, entered, the, king, s, school, canterbury, harvey, stayed, at, the, king, s, school, for, five, years, after, which, he, matriculated, at, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, in, 1593, harvey, graduated, as, a, bachelor, of, arts, from, caius, in, 1597, he, then, travelled, through, france, and, germany, to, italy, where, he, entered, the, university, of, padua, in, 1599, during, harvey, s, years, of, study, there, he, developed, a, relationship, with, fabricius, and, read, fabricius, s, de, venarum, ostiolis, harvey, graduated, as, a, doctor, of, medicine, at, the, age, of, 24, from, the, university, of, padua, on, 25, april, 1602, harvey, had, conducted, himself, so, wonderfully, well, in, the, examination, and, had, shown, such, skill, memory, and, learning, that, he, had, far, surpassed, even, the, great, hopes, which, his, examiners, had, formed, of, him, after, graduating, from, padua, harvey, immediately, returned, to, england, where, he, obtained, the, degree, of, doctor, of, medicine, from, the, university, of, cambridge, that, same, year, and, became, a, fellow, of, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, following, this, harvey, established, himself, in, london, joining, the, royal, college, of, physicians, on, 5, october, 1604, a, few, weeks, after, his, admission, harvey, married, elizabeth, browne, daughter, of, lancelot, browne, dr, physic, a, medical, doctor, they, had, no, children, harvey, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, college, of, physicians, on, 5, june, 1607, which, earned, him, the, post, nominal, letters, frcp, he, then, accepted, a, position, at, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, that, he, was, to, occupy, for, almost, all, the, rest, of, his, life, succeeding, dr, wilkinson, on, 14, october, 1609, he, became, the, physician, in, charge, at, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, which, enjoined, him, in, god, s, most, holy, name, to, endeavor, yourself, to, do, the, best, of, your, knowledge, in, the, profession, of, physic, to, the, poor, then, present, or, any, other, of, the, poor, at, any, time, of, the, week, which, shall, be, sent, home, unto, you, by, the, hospitaller, you, shall, not, for, favor, lucre, or, gain, appoint, or, write, anything, for, the, poor, but, such, good, and, wholesome, things, as, you, shall, think, with, your, best, advice, will, do, the, poor, good, without, any, affection, or, respect, to, be, had, to, the, apothecary, and, you, shall, take, no, gift, or, reward, for, your, counsel, this, you, will, promise, to, do, as, you, shall, answer, before, god, harvey, earned, around, thirty, three, pounds, a, year, and, lived, in, a, small, house, in, ludgate, although, two, houses, in, west, smithfield, were, attached, as, fringe, benefits, to, the, post, of, physician, at, this, point, the, physician, s, function, consisted, of, a, simple, but, thorough, analysis, of, patients, who, were, brought, to, the, hospital, once, a, week, and, the, subsequent, writing, of, prescriptions, the, next, important, phase, of, harvey, s, life, began, with, his, appointment, to, the, office, of, lumleian, lecturer, on, 4, august, 1615, the, lumleian, lectureship, founded, by, lord, lumley, and, dr, richard, caldwell, in, 1582, consisted, in, giving, lectures, for, a, period, of, seven, years, with, the, purpose, of, spreading, light, and, increasing, the, general, knowledge, of, anatomy, throughout, england, harvey, began, his, lectures, in, april, 1616, and, also, compiled, his, lecture, notes, in, a, notebook, at, this, time, at, the, age, of, thirty, seven, he, was, described, as, a, man, of, lowest, stature, round, faced, his, eyes, small, round, very, black, and, full, of, spirit, his, hair, as, black, as, a, raven, and, curling, the, notes, which, he, used, at, the, time, are, preserved, in, the, british, museum, at, the, beginning, of, his, lectures, harvey, laid, down, the, canons, for, his, guidance, harvey, continued, to, participate, in, the, lumleian, lectures, while, also, taking, care, of, his, patients, at, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, he, thus, soon, attained, an, important, and, fairly, lucrative, practice, which, climaxed, with, his, appointment, as, physician, extraordinary, to, king, james, i, on, 3, february, 1618, he, seems, to, have, similarly, served, various, aristocrats, including, lord, chancellor, bacon, bacon, entirely, failed, to, impress, the, more, practical, minded, harvey, who, refused, to, regard, him, as, a, great, philosopher, he, said, of, him, he, writes, philosophy, like, a, lord, chancellor, in, 1628, he, published, in, frankfurt, his, completed, treatise, on, the, circulation, of, the, blood, the, de, motu, cordis, as, a, result, of, negative, comments, by, other, physicians, harvey, fell, mightily, in, his, practice, but, continued, advancing, his, career, he, was, re, elected, censor, of, the, college, of, physicians, in, 1629, having, been, elected, for, the, first, time, in, 1613, and, the, second, time, in, 1625, eventually, harvey, was, also, elected, treasurer, of, the, college, harvey, was, a, prominent, sceptic, regarding, allegations, of, witchcraft, he, was, one, of, the, examiners, of, four, women, from, lancashire, accused, of, witchcraft, in, 1634, and, as, a, consequence, of, his, report, all, of, them, were, acquitted, earlier, in, 1632, while, travelling, with, the, king, to, newmarket, he, had, been, sent, to, investigate, a, woman, accused, of, being, a, witch, initially, he, told, her, that, he, was, a, wizard, and, had, come, to, discuss, the, craft, with, her, and, asked, whether, she, had, a, familiar, she, put, down, a, saucer, of, milk, and, called, to, a, toad, which, came, out, and, drank, the, milk, he, then, sent, her, out, to, fetch, some, ale, killed, the, toad, and, dissected, it, concluding, that, it, was, a, perfectly, ordinary, animal, and, not, supernatural, in, any, way, when, the, woman, returned, she, was, naturally, very, angry, and, upset, but, harvey, eventually, silenced, her, by, stating, that, he, was, the, king, s, physician, sent, to, discover, whether, she, was, a, witch, and, if, she, were, to, have, her, apprehended, at, the, age, of, fifty, two, harvey, received, commands, from, the, king, to, accompany, the, duke, of, lennox, during, his, trip, abroad, this, voyage, the, first, after, harvey, s, return, from, padua, lasted, three, years, taking, harvey, through, the, countries, of, france, and, spain, during, the, mantuan, war, and, plague, during, this, journey, he, wrote, to, viscount, dorchester, i, can, complain, that, by, the, way, we, could, scarce, see, a, dog, crow, kite, raven, or, any, other, bird, or, anything, to, anatomize, only, some, few, miserable, people, the, relics, of, the, war, and, the, plague, where, famine, had, made, anatomies, before, i, came, it, is, scarce, credible, in, so, rich, populous, and, plentiful, countries, as, these, were, that, so, much, misery, and, desolation, poverty, and, famine, should, in, so, short, a, time, be, as, we, have, seen, i, interpret, it, well, that, it, will, be, a, great, motive, for, all, here, to, have, and, procure, assurance, of, settled, peace, it, is, time, to, leave, fighting, when, there, is, nothing, to, eat, nothing, to, be, kept, and, nothing, to, be, gotten, having, returned, to, england, in, 1632, harvey, accompanied, king, charles, i, wherever, he, went, as, physician, in, ordinary, in, particular, charles, s, hunting, expeditions, gave, harvey, access, to, many, deer, carcasses, it, was, upon, them, that, harvey, made, many, observations, and, developed, his, theories, harvey, returned, to, italy, in, october, 1636, dining, at, the, english, college, rome, as, a, guest, of, the, jesuits, there, it, is, possible, he, met, galileo, in, florence, en, route, during, the, english, civil, war, a, mob, of, citizen, soldiers, opposed, to, the, king, entered, harvey, s, lodgings, stole, his, goods, and, scattered, his, papers, the, papers, consisted, of, the, records, of, a, large, number, of, dissections, of, diseased, bodies, with, his, observations, on, the, development, on, insects, and, a, series, of, notes, on, comparative, anatomy, during, this, period, harvey, maintained, his, position, helped, the, wounded, on, several, occasions, and, protected, the, king, s, children, during, the, battle, of, edgehill, the, conflicts, of, the, civil, war, soon, led, king, charles, to, oxford, with, harvey, attending, where, the, physician, was, made, doctor, of, physic, in, 1642, and, later, warden, of, merton, college, in, 1645, in, oxford, he, harvey, very, soon, settled, down, to, his, accustomed, pursuits, unmindful, of, the, clatter, of, arms, and, of, the, constant, marching, and, countermarching, around, him, for, the, city, remained, the, base, of, operations, until, its, surrender, the, surrender, of, oxford, in, 1645, marks, the, beginning, of, harvey, s, gradual, retirement, from, public, life, and, duties, now, sixty, eight, years, old, and, childless, harvey, had, lost, three, brothers, and, his, wife, by, this, time, he, thus, decided, to, return, to, london, and, lived, with, his, brothers, eliab, and, daniel, at, different, periods, having, retired, from, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, and, his, various, other, aforementioned, positions, he, passed, most, of, this, time, reading, general, literature, several, attempts, to, bring, harvey, back, into, the, working, world, were, made, however, here, is, an, excerpt, of, one, of, harvey, s, answers, would, you, be, the, man, who, should, recommend, me, to, quit, the, peaceful, haven, where, i, now, pass, my, life, and, launch, again, upon, the, faithless, sea, you, know, full, well, what, a, storm, my, former, lucubrations, raised, much, better, is, it, oftentimes, to, grow, wise, at, home, and, in, private, than, by, publishing, what, you, have, amassed, with, infinite, labour, to, stir, up, tempests, that, may, rob, you, of, peace, and, quiet, for, the, rest, of, your, days, harvey, died, at, roehampton, in, the, house, of, his, brother, eliab, on, 3, june, 1657, descriptions, of, the, event, seem, to, show, that, he, died, of, a, cerebral, haemorrhage, from, vessels, long, injured, by, gout, it, is, highly, probable, that, the, left, middle, cerebral, artery, malfunctioned, leading, to, a, gradual, accumulation, of, blood, in, the, brain, which, eventually, overwhelmed, it, there, exists, a, fairly, detailed, account, of, what, happened, on, that, day, harvey, went, to, speak, and, found, that, he, had, the, dead, palsy, in, his, tongue, then, he, saw, what, was, to, become, of, him, he, knew, there, were, then, no, hopes, of, his, recovery, so, presently, he, sends, for, his, young, nephews, to, come, up, to, him, he, then, made, signs, for, seized, with, the, dead, palsy, in, his, tongue, he, could, not, speak, to, let, him, blood, his, tongue, which, did, him, little, or, no, good, and, so, ended, his, days, dying, in, the, evening, of, the, day, on, which, he, was, stricken, the, palsy, giving, him, an, easy, passport, his, will, distributed, his, material, goods, and, wealth, throughout, his, extended, family, and, also, left, a, substantial, amount, of, money, to, the, royal, college, of, physicians, harvey, was, buried, in, st, andrew, s, church, in, hempstead, in, northern, essex, the, funeral, procession, started, on, 26, june, 1657, leading, harvey, to, be, placed, in, the, harvey, chapel, built, by, eliab, the, conditions, of, harvey, s, burial, are, also, known, harvey, was, laid, in, the, chapel, between, the, bodies, of, his, two, nieces, and, like, them, he, was, lapt, in, lead, coffin, less, on, st, luke, s, day, 18, october, 1883, harvey, s, remains, were, reinterred, the, leaden, case, carried, from, the, vault, by, eight, fellows, of, the, college, of, physicians, and, deposited, in, a, sarcophagus, containing, his, works, and, an, inscription, the, body, of, william, harvey, lapt, in, lead, simply, soldered, was, laid, without, shell, or, enclosure, of, any, kind, in, the, harvey, vault, of, this, church, of, hempstead, essex, in, june, 1657, in, the, course, of, time, the, lead, enclosing, the, remains, was, from, expose, and, natural, decay, so, seriously, damaged, as, to, endanger, its, preservation, rendering, some, repair, of, it, the, duty, of, those, interested, in, the, memory, of, the, illustrious, discoverer, of, the, circulation, of, the, blood, the, royal, college, of, physicians, of, which, corporate, body, harvey, was, a, munificent, benefactor, did, in, the, years, 1882, 1883, by, permission, of, the, representatives, of, the, harvey, family, undertake, this, duty, in, accordance, with, this, determination, the, leaden, mortuary, chest, containing, the, remains, of, harvey, was, repaired, and, was, as, far, as, possible, restored, to, its, original, state, published, in, 1628, in, the, city, of, frankfurt, host, to, an, annual, book, fair, that, harvey, knew, would, allow, immediate, dispersion, of, his, work, the, 72, page, exercitatio, anatomica, de, motu, cordis, et, sanguinis, in, animalibus, contains, the, mature, account, of, the, circulation, of, the, blood, opening, with, a, dedication, to, king, charles, i, the, quarto, has, 17, chapters, which, give, a, clear, and, connected, account, of, the, action, of, the, heart, and, the, consequent, movement, of, the, blood, around, the, body, in, a, circuit, having, only, a, tiny, lens, at, his, disposal, harvey, was, not, able, to, reach, the, adequate, pictures, that, were, attained, through, such, microscopes, used, by, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, thus, he, had, to, resort, to, theory, and, not, practical, evidence, in, certain, parts, of, his, book, after, the, first, chapter, which, simply, outlines, past, ideas, and, accepted, rules, regarding, the, heart, and, lungs, harvey, moves, on, to, a, fundamental, premise, to, his, treatise, stating, that, it, was, important, to, study, the, heart, when, it, was, active, in, order, to, truly, comprehend, its, true, movement, a, task, which, even, he, found, of, great, difficulty, as, he, says, i, found, the, task, so, truly, arduous, that, i, was, almost, tempted, to, think, that, the, movement, of, the, heart, was, only, to, be, comprehended, by, god, for, i, could, neither, rightly, perceive, at, first, when, the, systole, and, when, the, diastole, took, place, by, reason, of, the, rapidity, of, the, movement, this, initial, thought, led, harvey, s, ambition, and, assiduousness, to, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, overall, structure, of, the, heart, studied, with, fewer, hindrances, in, cold, blooded, animals, after, this, harvey, analyses, the, arteries, showing, how, their, pulsation, depends, upon, the, contraction, of, the, left, ventricle, while, the, contraction, of, the, right, ventricle, propels, its, charge, of, blood, into, the, pulmonary, artery, whilst, doing, this, the, physician, reiterates, the, fact, that, these, two, ventricles, move, together, almost, simultaneously, and, not, independently, as, had, been, thought, previously, by, his, predecessors, this, discovery, was, made, while, observing, the, heart, of, such, animals, as, the, eel, and, several, other, types, of, fish, indeed, the, general, study, of, countless, animals, was, of, utmost, importance, to, harvey, s, research, among, the, ones, already, cited, one, can, add, the, study, of, the, snail, the, invisible, shrimp, the, chick, before, its, hatching, and, even, the, pigeon, a, digression, to, an, experiment, can, be, made, to, this, note, using, the, inactive, heart, of, a, dead, pigeon, and, placing, upon, it, a, finger, wet, with, saliva, harvey, was, able, to, witness, a, transitory, and, yet, incontrovertible, pulsation, he, had, just, witnessed, the, heart, s, ability, to, recover, from, fatigue, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, william, harvey, had, already, discerned, the, existence, of, the, ductus, arteriosus, and, explained, its, relative, function, here, he, says, in, embryos, whilst, the, lungs, are, in, a, state, of, inaction, performing, no, function, subject, to, no, movement, any, more, than, if, they, had, not, been, present, nature, uses, the, two, ventricles, of, the, heart, as, if, they, formed, but, one, for, the, transmission, of, the, blood, however, the, apex, of, harvey, s, work, is, probably, the, eighth, chapter, in, which, he, deals, with, the, actual, quantity, of, blood, passing, through, the, heart, from, the, veins, to, the, arteries, coming, into, conflict, with, galen, s, accepted, view, of, the, liver, as, the, origin, of, venous, blood, harvey, estimated, the, capacity, of, the, heart, how, much, blood, is, expelled, through, each, pump, of, the, heart, and, the, number, of, times, the, heart, beats, in, a, half, an, hour, all, of, these, estimates, were, purposefully, low, so, that, people, could, see, the, vast, amount, of, blood, galen, s, theory, required, the, liver, to, produce, he, estimated, that, the, capacity, of, the, heart, was, 1, 5, imperial, fluid, ounces, 43, ml, and, that, every, time, the, heart, pumps, 1, 8, of, that, blood, is, expelled, this, led, to, harvey, s, estimate, that, about, 1, 6, imperial, fluid, ounce, 4, 7, ml, of, blood, went, through, the, heart, every, time, it, pumped, the, next, estimate, he, used, was, that, the, heart, beats, 1, 000, times, every, half, an, hour, which, gave, 10, pounds, 6, ounces, of, blood, in, a, half, an, hour, and, when, this, number, was, multiplied, by, 48, half, hours, in, a, day, he, realised, that, the, liver, would, have, to, produce, 498, pounds, of, blood, in, a, day, more, than, the, weight, of, the, whole, body, having, this, simple, but, essential, mathematical, proportion, at, hand, which, proved, the, overall, impossible, aforementioned, role, of, the, liver, harvey, went, on, to, prove, how, the, blood, circulated, in, a, circle, by, means, of, countless, experiments, initially, done, on, serpents, and, fish, tying, their, veins, and, arteries, in, separate, periods, of, time, harvey, noticed, the, modifications, which, occurred, indeed, as, he, tied, the, veins, the, heart, would, become, empty, while, as, he, did, the, same, to, the, arteries, the, organ, would, swell, up, this, process, was, later, performed, on, the, human, body, in, the, image, on, the, right, the, physician, tied, a, tight, ligature, onto, the, upper, arm, of, a, person, this, would, cut, off, blood, flow, from, the, arteries, and, the, veins, when, this, was, done, the, arm, below, the, ligature, was, cool, and, pale, while, above, the, ligature, it, was, warm, and, swollen, the, ligature, was, loosened, slightly, which, allowed, blood, from, the, arteries, to, come, into, the, arm, since, arteries, are, deeper, in, the, flesh, than, the, veins, when, this, was, done, the, opposite, effect, was, seen, in, the, lower, arm, it, was, now, warm, and, swollen, the, veins, were, also, more, visible, since, now, they, were, full, of, blood, harvey, then, noticed, little, bumps, in, the, veins, which, he, realised, were, the, valves, of, the, veins, discovered, by, his, teacher, hieronymus, fabricius, harvey, tried, to, push, blood, in, the, vein, down, the, arm, but, to, no, avail, when, he, tried, to, push, it, up, the, arm, it, moved, quite, easily, the, same, effect, was, seen, in, other, veins, of, the, body, except, the, veins, in, the, neck, those, veins, were, different, from, the, others, they, did, not, allow, blood, to, flow, up, but, only, down, this, led, harvey, to, believe, that, the, veins, allowed, blood, to, flow, to, the, heart, and, the, valves, maintained, the, one, way, flow, contrary, to, a, popular, misconception, harvey, did, not, predict, the, existence, of, capillaries, his, observations, convinced, him, that, direct, connection, between, veins, and, arteries, are, unnecessary, he, wrote, blood, permeates, the, pores, in, the, flesh, and, it, is, absorbed, and, imbibed, from, every, part, by, the, veins, harvey, s, discovery, of, the, circulation, of, the, blood, was, based, on, inference, not, direct, observation, and, was, incompatible, with, the, prevailing, paradigm, at, the, time, that, paradigm, held, among, other, things, that, the, blood, could, flow, from, one, side, of, the, heart, to, the, other, harvey, knew, that, he, was, facing, an, uphill, battle, but, what, remains, to, be, said, about, the, quantity, and, source, of, the, blood, which, thus, passes, is, of, so, novel, and, unheard, of, character, that, i, not, only, fear, injury, to, myself, from, the, envy, of, a, few, but, i, tremble, lest, i, have, mankind, at, large, for, my, enemies, so, much, doth, want, and, custom, that, become, as, another, nature, and, doctrine, once, sown, and, that, hath, struck, deep, root, and, respect, for, antiquity, influence, all, men, still, the, die, is, cast, and, my, trust, is, in, my, love, of, truth, and, the, candour, that, inheres, in, cultivated, minds, harvey, s, premonitions, that, his, discovery, would, be, met, with, scepticism, derision, and, abuse, were, entirely, justified, it, took, twenty, years, for, his, theory, of, the, circulation, of, the, blood, to, be, generally, accepted, at, the, time, of, harvey, s, publication, galen, had, been, an, influential, medical, authority, for, several, centuries, galen, believed, that, blood, passed, between, the, ventricles, by, means, of, invisible, pores, according, to, galen, s, views, the, venous, system, was, quite, separate, from, the, arterial, system, except, when, they, came, in, contact, through, the, unseen, pores, arabic, scholar, ibn, al, nafis, had, disputed, aspects, of, galen, s, views, providing, a, model, that, seems, to, imply, a, form, of, pulmonary, circulation, in, his, commentary, on, anatomy, in, avicenna, s, canon, 1242, al, nafis, stated, that, blood, moved, from, the, heart, to, the, lungs, where, it, mixed, with, air, and, then, back, to, the, heart, from, which, it, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, body, harvey, s, discoveries, inevitably, and, historically, came, into, conflict, with, galen, s, teachings, and, the, publication, of, his, treatise, de, motu, cordis, incited, considerable, controversy, within, the, medical, community, some, doctors, affirmed, they, would, rather, err, with, galen, than, proclaim, the, truth, with, harvey, galen, incompletely, perceived, the, function, of, the, heart, believing, it, a, productor, of, heat, while, the,
