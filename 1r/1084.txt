solely, on, the, testimony, of, muslim, authors, thapar, also, argued, against, the, prevalent, narrative, yet, in, a, curiously, contradictory, manner, the, turko, persian, narratives, were, accepted, as, historically, valid, and, even, their, internal, contradictions, were, not, given, much, attention, largely, because, they, approximated, more, closely, to, the, current, european, sense, of, history, than, did, the, other, sources, the, last, four, years, of, mahmud, s, life, were, spent, contending, with, the, influx, of, oghuz, and, seljuk, turks, from, central, asia, and,
