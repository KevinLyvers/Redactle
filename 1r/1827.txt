in, machine, code, he, did, not, utilize, assembly, language, he, then, purchased, a, sinclair, ql, which, he, modified, extensively, especially, its, operating, system, because, it, was, so, hard, to, get, software, for, it, in, finland, he, wrote, his, own, assembler, and, editor, in, addition, to, pac, man, graphics, libraries, for, the, ql, and, a, few, games, he, wrote, a, pac, man, clone, cool, man, torvalds, attended, the, university, of, helsinki, from, 1988, to, 1996, graduating, with, a, master, s, degree, in, computer, science, from, the, nodes, research, group, his, textbooks, while, there, included, programming, the, 80386, by, john, h, crawford, and, patrick, p, gelsinger, sybex, 1987, isbn, 0895883813, and, the, design, of, the, unix, operating, system, by, maurice, j, bach, prentice, hall, 1986, isbn, 0, 13, 201799, 7, he, bought, computer, science, professor, andrew, tanenbaum, s, book, operating, systems, design, and, implementation, in, which, tanenbaum, describes, minix, an, educational, stripped, down, version, of, unix, in, 1990, torvalds, resumed, his, university, studies, and, was, exposed, to, unix, for, the, first, time, in, the, form, of, a, dec, microvax, running, ultrix, his, msc, thesis, was, titled, linux, a, portable, operating, system, on, 5, january, 1991, he, purchased, an, intel, 80386, based, ibm, pc, clone, before, receiving, his, minix, copy, which, in, turn, enabled, him, to, begin, work, on, linux, his, academic, career, was, interrupted, after, his, first, year, of, study, when, he, joined, the, finnish, navy, nyland, brigade, in, the, summer, of, 1989, selecting, the, 11, month, officer, training, program, to, fulfill, the, mandatory, military, service, of, finland, he, gained, the, rank, of, second, lieutenant, with, the, role, of, an, artillery, observer, the, first, linux, prototypes, were, publicly, released, in, late, 1991, version, 1, 0, was, released, on, 14, march, 1994, torvalds, first, encountered, the, gnu, project, in, fall, of, 1991, when, another, swedish, speaking, computer, science, student, lars, wirzenius, took, him, to, the, university, of, technology, to, listen, to, free, software, guru, richard, stallman, s, speech, torvalds, would, ultimately, switch, his, original, license, which, forbade, commercial, use, to, stallman, s, gnu, general, public, license, version, 2, gplv2, for, his, linux, kernel, after, complaints, of, distributors, being, unable, to, recoup, their, costs, due, to, a, non, commercial, clause, after, a, visit, to, transmeta, in, late, 1996, torvalds, accepted, a, position, at, the, company, in, california, where, he, worked, from, february, 1997, to, june, 2003, he, then, moved, to, the, open, source, development, labs, which, has, since, merged, with, the, free, standards, group, to, become, the, linux, foundation, under, whose, auspices, he, continues, to, work, in, june, 2004, torvalds, and, his, family, moved, to, dunthorpe, oregon, to, be, closer, to, the, osdl, s, headquarters, in, beaverton, from, 1997, to, 1999, he, was, involved, in, 86open, helping, select, the, standard, binary, format, for, linux, and, unix, in, 1999, he, was, named, by, the, mit, technology, review, tr100, as, one, of, the, world, s, top, 100, innovators, under, age, 35, in, 1999, red, hat, and, va, linux, both, leading, developers, of, linux, based, software, presented, torvalds, with, stock, options, in, gratitude, for, his, creation, that, year, both, companies, went, public, and, torvalds, s, share, value, briefly, shot, up, to, about, us, 20, million, his, personal, mascot, is, a, penguin, nicknamed, tux, which, has, been, widely, adopted, by, the, linux, community, as, the, linux, kernel, s, mascot, although, torvalds, believes, open, source, is, the, only, right, way, to, do, software, he, also, has, said, that, he, uses, the, best, tool, for, the, job, even, if, that, includes, proprietary, software, he, was, criticized, for, his, use, and, alleged, advocacy, of, the, proprietary, bitkeeper, software, for, version, control, in, the, linux, kernel, he, subsequently, wrote, a, free, software, replacement, for, it, called, git, in, 2008, torvalds, stated, that, he, used, the, fedora, linux, distribution, because, it, had, fairly, good, support, for, the, powerpc, processor, architecture, which, he, favored, at, the, time, he, confirmed, this, in, a, 2012, interview, torvalds, abandoned, gnome, for, a, while, after, the, release, of, gnome, 3, 0, saying, the, developers, have, apparently, decided, that, it, s, too, complicated, to, actually, do, real, work, on, your, desktop, and, have, decided, to, make, it, really, annoying, to, do, he, then, switched, to, xfce, in, 2013, torvalds, resumed, using, gnome, noting, that, they, have, extensions, now, that, are, still, much, too, hard, to, find, but, with, extensions, you, can, make, your, desktop, look, almost, as, good, as, it, used, to, look, two, years, ago, the, linux, foundation, currently, sponsors, torvalds, so, he, can, work, full, time, on, improving, linux, torvalds, is, known, for, vocally, disagreeing, with, other, developers, on, the, linux, kernel, mailing, list, calling, himself, a, really, unpleasant, person, he, explained, i, d, like, to, be, a, nice, person, and, curse, less, and, encourage, people, to, grow, rather, than, telling, them, they, are, idiots, i, m, sorry, i, tried, it, s, just, not, in, me, his, attitude, which, he, considers, necessary, for, making, his, points, clear, has, drawn, criticism, from, intel, programmer, sage, sharp, and, systemd, developer, lennart, poettering, among, others, on, sunday, 16, september, 2018, the, linux, kernel, code, of, conflict, was, suddenly, replaced, by, a, new, code, of, conduct, based, on, the, contributor, covenant, shortly, thereafter, in, the, release, notes, for, linux, 4, 19, rc4, torvalds, apologized, for, his, behavior, calling, his, personal, attacks, of, the, past, unprofessional, and, uncalled, for, and, announced, a, period, of, time, off, to, get, some, assistance, on, how, to, understand, people, s, emotions, and, respond, appropriately, it, soon, transpired, that, these, events, followed, the, new, yorker, approaching, torvalds, with, a, series, of, questions, critical, of, his, conduct, following, the, release, of, linux, 4, 19, on, 22, october, 2018, torvalds, returned, to, maintaining, the, kernel, initially, torvalds, wanted, to, call, the, kernel, he, developed, freax, a, combination, of, free, freak, and, the, letter, x, to, indicate, that, it, was, a, unix, like, system, but, his, friend, ari, lemmke, who, administered, the, ftp, server, where, the, kernel, was, first, hosted, named, torvalds, directory, linux, as, of, 2006, approximately, 2, of, the, linux, kernel, was, written, by, torvalds, himself, despite, the, thousands, who, have, contributed, to, it, his, percentage, is, still, one, of, the, largest, however, he, said, in, 2012, that, his, own, personal, contribution, is, now, mostly, merging, code, written, by, others, with, little, programming, he, retains, the, highest, authority, to, decide, which, new, code, is, incorporated, into, the, standard, linux, kernel, torvalds, holds, the, linux, trademark, and, monitors, its, use, chiefly, through, the, linux, mark, institute, on, 3, april, 2005, torvalds, began, development, on, git, version, control, software, that, later, became, widely, used, on, 26, july, 2005, he, turned, over, git, s, maintenance, to, junio, hamano, a, major, project, contributor, subsurface, is, software, for, logging, and, planning, scuba, dives, which, torvalds, began, developing, in, late, 2011, it, is, free, and, open, source, software, distributed, under, the, terms, of, the, gnu, general, public, license, version, 2, dirk, hohndel, became, its, head, maintainer, in, late, 2012, linus, torvalds, is, married, to, tove, torvalds, n, e, monni, a, six, time, finnish, national, karate, champion, whom, he, met, in, late, 1993, he, was, running, introductory, computer, laboratory, exercises, for, students, and, instructed, the, course, attendees, to, send, him, an, e, mail, as, a, test, to, which, tove, responded, with, an, e, mail, asking, for, a, date, they, were, later, married, and, have, three, daughters, two, of, whom, were, born, in, the, united, states, the, linux, kernel, s, reboot, system, call, accepts, their, dates, of, birth, written, in, hexadecimal, as, magic, values, torvalds, has, described, himself, as, completely, a, religious, atheist, adding, i, find, that, people, seem, to, think, religion, brings, morals, and, appreciation, of, nature, i, actually, think, it, detracts, from, both, it, gives, people, the, excuse, to, say, oh, nature, was, just, created, and, so, the, act, of, creation, is, seen, to, be, something, miraculous, i, appreciate, the, fact, that, wow, it, s, incredible, that, something, like, this, could, have, happened, in, the, first, place, he, later, added, that, while, in, europe, religion, is, mostly, a, personal, issue, in, the, united, states, it, has, become, very, politicized, when, discussing, the, issue, of, church, and, state, separation, he, said, yeah, it, s, kind, of, ironic, that, in, many, european, countries, there, is, actually, a, kind, of, legal, binding, between, the, state, and, the, state, religion, in, linus, the, liberator, a, story, about, the, march, linuxworld, conference, torvalds, says, there, are, like, two, golden, rules, in, life, one, is, do, unto, others, as, you, would, want, them, to, do, unto, you, for, some, reason, people, associate, this, with, christianity, i, m, not, a, christian, i, m, agnostic, the, other, rule, is, be, proud, of, what, you, do, in, 2004, torvalds, moved, with, his, family, from, silicon, valley, to, portland, oregon, in, 2010, torvalds, became, a, united, states, citizen, and, registered, to, vote, in, the, united, states, as, of, that, year, he, was, unaffiliated, with, any, u, s, political, party, saying, i, have, way, too, much, personal, pride, to, want, to, be, associated, with, any, of, them, quite, frankly, linus, developed, an, interest, in, scuba, diving, in, the, early, 2000s, and, has, achieved, numerous, certifications, leading, him, to, create, the, subsurface, project, university, of, helsinki, has, named, an, auditorium, after, torvalds, and, his, computer, is, on, display, at, the, department, of, computer, science, time,
