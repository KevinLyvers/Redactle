heinrich, rudolf, hertz, h, r, t, s, hurts, german, 22, february, 1857, 1, january, 1894, was, a, german, physicist, who, first, conclusively, proved, the, existence, of, the, electromagnetic, waves, predicted, by, james, clerk, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, the, unit, of, frequency, cycle, per, second, was, named, the, hertz, in, his, honor, heinrich, rudolf, hertz, was, born, in, 1857, in, hamburg, then, a, sovereign, state, of, the, german, confederation, into, a, prosperous, and, cultured, hanseatic, family, his, father, was, gustav, ferdinand, hertz, his, mother, was, anna, elisabeth, pfefferkorn, while, studying, at, the, gelehrtenschule, des, johanneums, in, hamburg, hertz, showed, an, aptitude, for, sciences, as, well, as, languages, learning, arabic, he, studied, sciences, and, engineering, in, the, german, cities, of, dresden, munich, and, berlin, where, he, studied, under, gustav, r, kirchhoff, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, in, 1880, hertz, obtained, his, phd, from, the, university, of, berlin, and, for, the, next, three, years, remained, for, post, doctoral, study, under, helmholtz, serving, as, his, assistant, in, 1883, hertz, took, a, post, as, a, lecturer, in, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, kiel, in, 1885, hertz, became, a, full, professor, at, the, university, of, karlsruhe, in, 1886, hertz, married, elisabeth, doll, the, daughter, of, max, doll, a, lecturer, in, geometry, at, karlsruhe, they, had, two, daughters, johanna, born, on, 20, october, 1887, and, mathilde, born, on, 14, january, 1891, who, went, on, to, become, a, notable, biologist, during, this, time, hertz, conducted, his, landmark, research, into, electromagnetic, waves, hertz, took, a, position, of, professor, of, physics, and, director, of, the, physics, institute, in, bonn, on, 3, april, 1889, a, position, he, held, until, his, death, during, this, time, he, worked, on, theoretical, mechanics, with, his, work, published, in, the, book, die, prinzipien, der, mechanik, in, neuem, zusammenhange, dargestellt, the, principles, of, mechanics, presented, in, a, new, form, published, posthumously, in, 1894, in, 1892, hertz, was, diagnosed, with, an, infection, after, a, bout, of, severe, migraines, and, underwent, operations, to, treat, the, illness, he, died, due, to, complications, after, surgery, which, had, attempted, to, cure, his, condition, some, consider, his, ailment, to, have, been, caused, by, a, malignant, bone, condition, he, died, at, the, age, of, 36, in, bonn, germany, in, 1894, and, was, buried, in, the, ohlsdorf, cemetery, in, hamburg, hertz, s, wife, elisabeth, hertz, n, e, doll, 1864, 1941, did, not, remarry, he, was, survived, by, his, daughters, johanna, 1887, 1967, and, mathilde, 1891, 1975, neither, ever, married, or, had, children, hence, hertz, has, no, living, descendants, in, 1864, scottish, mathematical, physicist, james, clerk, maxwell, proposed, a, comprehensive, theory, of, electromagnetism, now, called, maxwell, s, equations, maxwell, s, theory, predicted, that, coupled, electric, and, magnetic, fields, could, travel, through, space, as, an, electromagnetic, wave, maxwell, proposed, that, light, consisted, of, electromagnetic, waves, of, short, wavelength, but, no, one, had, been, able, to, prove, this, or, generate, or, detect, electromagnetic, waves, of, other, wavelengths, during, hertz, s, studies, in, 1879, helmholtz, suggested, that, hertz, s, doctoral, dissertation, be, on, testing, maxwell, s, theory, helmholtz, had, also, proposed, the, berlin, prize, problem, that, year, at, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, for, anyone, who, could, experimentally, prove, an, electromagnetic, effect, in, the, polarization, and, depolarization, of, insulators, something, predicted, by, maxwell, s, theory, helmholtz, was, sure, hertz, was, the, most, likely, candidate, to, win, it, not, seeing, any, way, to, build, an, apparatus, to, experimentally, test, this, hertz, thought, it, was, too, difficult, and, worked, on, electromagnetic, induction, instead, hertz, did, produce, an, analysis, of, maxwell, s, equations, during, his, time, at, kiel, showing, they, did, have, more, validity, than, the, then, prevalent, action, at, a, distance, theories, in, the, autumn, of, 1886, after, hertz, received, his, professorship, at, karlsruhe, he, was, experimenting, with, a, pair, of, riess, spirals, when, he, noticed, that, discharging, a, leyden, jar, into, one, of, these, coils, produced, a, spark, in, the, other, coil, with, an, idea, on, how, to, build, an, apparatus, hertz, now, had, a, way, to, proceed, with, the, berlin, prize, problem, of, 1879, on, proving, maxwell, s, theory, although, the, actual, prize, had, expired, uncollected, in, 1882, he, used, a, dipole, antenna, consisting, of, two, collinear, one, meter, wires, with, a, spark, gap, between, their, inner, ends, and, zinc, spheres, attached, to, the, outer, ends, for, capacitance, as, a, radiator, the, antenna, was, excited, by, pulses, of, high, voltage, of, about, 30, kilovolts, applied, between, the, two, sides, from, a, ruhmkorff, coil, he, received, the, waves, with, a, resonant, single, loop, antenna, with, a, micrometer, spark, gap, between, the, ends, this, experiment, produced, and, received, what, are, now, called, radio, waves, in, the, very, high, frequency, range, between, 1886, and, 1889, hertz, conducted, a, series, of, experiments, that, would, prove, the, effects, he, was, observing, were, results, of, maxwell, s, predicted, electromagnetic, waves, starting, in, november, 1887, with, his, paper, on, electromagnetic, effects, produced, by, electrical, disturbances, in, insulators, hertz, sent, a, series, of, papers, to, helmholtz, at, the, berlin, academy, including, papers, in, 1888, that, showed, transverse, free, space, electromagnetic, waves, traveling, at, a, finite, speed, over, a, distance, in, the, apparatus, hertz, used, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, radiated, away, from, the, wires, as, transverse, waves, hertz, had, positioned, the, oscillator, about, 12, meters, from, a, zinc, reflecting, plate, to, produce, standing, waves, each, wave, was, about, 4, meters, long, using, the, ring, detector, he, recorded, how, the, wave, s, magnitude, and, component, direction, varied, hertz, measured, maxwell, s, waves, and, demonstrated, that, the, velocity, of, these, waves, was, equal, to, the, velocity, of, light, the, electric, field, intensity, polarization, and, reflection, of, the, waves, were, also, measured, by, hertz, these, experiments, established, that, light, and, these, waves, were, both, a, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, obeying, the, maxwell, equations, hertz, did, not, realize, the, practical, importance, of, his, radio, wave, experiments, he, stated, that, it, s, of, no, use, whatsoever, this, is, just, an, experiment, that, proves, maestro, maxwell, was, right, we, just, have, these, mysterious, electromagnetic, waves, that, we, cannot, see, with, the, naked, eye, but, they, are, there, asked, about, the, applications, of, his, discoveries, hertz, replied, nothing, i, guess, hertz, s, proof, of, the, existence, of, airborne, electromagnetic, waves, led, to, an, explosion, of, experimentation, with, this, new, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, which, was, called, hertzian, waves, until, around, 1910, when, the, term, radio, waves, became, current, within, 10, years, researchers, such, as, oliver, lodge, ferdinand, braun, and, guglielmo, marconi, employed, radio, waves, in, the, first, wireless, telegraphy, radio, communication, systems, leading, to, radio, broadcasting, and, later, television, in, 1909, braun, and, marconi, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, contributions, to, the, development, of, wireless, telegraphy, today, radio, is, an, essential, technology, in, global, telecommunication, networks, and, the, communications, medium, used, by, modern, wireless, devices, in, 1892, hertz, began, experimenting, and, demonstrated, that, cathode, rays, could, penetrate, very, thin, metal, foil, such, as, aluminium, philipp, lenard, a, student, of, heinrich, hertz, further, researched, this, ray, effect, he, developed, a, version, of, the, cathode, tube, and, studied, the, penetration, by, x, rays, of, various, materials, however, lenard, did, not, realize, that, he, was, producing, x, rays, hermann, von, helmholtz, formulated, mathematical, equations, for, x, rays, he, postulated, a, dispersion, theory, before, r, ntgen, made, his, discovery, and, announcement, it, was, formed, on, the, basis, of, the, electromagnetic, theory, of, light, wiedmann, s, annalen, vol, xlviii, however, he, did, not, work, with, actual, x, rays, hertz, helped, establish, the, photoelectric, effect, which, was, later, explained, by, albert, einstein, when, he, noticed, that, a, charged, object, loses, its, charge, more, readily, when, illuminated, by, ultraviolet, radiation, uv, in, 1887, he, made, observations, of, the, photoelectric, effect, and, of, the, production, and, reception, of, electromagnetic, em, waves, published, in, the, journal, annalen, der, physik, his, receiver, consisted, of, a, coil, with, a, spark, gap, whereby, a, spark, would, be, seen, upon, detection, of, em, waves, he, placed, the, apparatus, in, a, darkened, box, to, see, the, spark, better, he, observed, that, the, maximum, spark, length, was, reduced, when, in, the, box, a, glass, panel, placed, between, the, source, of, em, waves, and, the, receiver, absorbed, uv, that, assisted, the, electrons, in, jumping, across, the, gap, when, removed, the, spark, length, would, increase, he, observed, no, decrease, in, spark, length, when, he, substituted, quartz, for, glass, as, quartz, does, not, absorb, uv, radiation, hertz, concluded, his, months, of, investigation, and, reported, the, results, obtained, he, did, not, further, pursue, investigation, of, this, effect, nor, did, he, make, any, attempt, at, explaining, how, the, observed, phenomenon, was, brought, about, in, 1881, and, 1882, hertz, published, two, articles, on, what, was, to, become, known, as, the, field, of, contact, mechanics, which, proved, to, be, an, important, basis, for, later, theories, in, the, field, joseph, valentin, boussinesq, published, some, critically, important, observations, on, hertz, s, work, nevertheless, establishing, this, work, on, contact, mechanics, to, be, of, immense, importance, his, work, basically, summarises, how, two, axi, symmetric, objects, placed, in, contact, will, behave, under, loading, he, obtained, results, based, upon, the, classical, theory, of, elasticity, and, continuum, mechanics, the, most, significant, flaw, of, his, theory, was, the, neglect, of, any, nature, of, adhesion, between, the, two, solids, which, proves, to, be, important, as, the, materials, composing, the, solids, start, to, assume, high, elasticity, it, was, natural, to, neglect, adhesion, at, the, time, however, as, there, were, no, experimental, methods, of, testing, for, it, to, develop, his, theory, hertz, used, his, observation, of, elliptical, newton, s, rings, formed, upon, placing, a, glass, sphere, upon, a, lens, as, the, basis, of, assuming, that, the, pressure, exerted, by, the, sphere, follows, an, elliptical, distribution, he, used, the, formation, of, newton, s, rings, again, while, validating, his, theory, with, experiments, in, calculating, the, displacement, which, the, sphere, has, into, the, lens, kenneth, l, johnson, k, kendall, and, a, d, roberts, jkr, used, this, theory, as, a, basis, while, calculating, the, theoretical, displacement, or, indentation, depth, in, the, presence, of, adhesion, in, 1971, hertz, s, theory, is, recovered, from, their, formulation, if, the, adhesion, of, the, materials, is, assumed, to, be, zero, similar, to, this, theory, however, using, different, assumptions, b, v, derjaguin, v, m, muller, and, y, p, toporov, published, another, theory, in, 1975, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, dmt, theory, in, the, research, community, which, also, recovered, hertz, s, formulations, under, the, assumption, of, zero, adhesion, this, dmt, theory, proved, to, be, premature, and, needed, several, revisions, before, it, came, to, be, accepted, as, another, material, contact, theory, in, addition, to, the, jkr, theory, both, the, dmt, and, the, jkr, theories, form, the, basis, of, contact, mechanics, upon, which, all, transition, contact, models, are, based, and, used, in, material, parameter, prediction, in, nanoindentation, and, atomic, force, microscopy, these, models, are, central, to, the, field, of, tribology, and, he, was, named, as, one, of, the, 23, men, of, tribology, by, duncan, dowson, despite, preceding, his, great, work, on, electromagnetism, which, he, himself, considered, with, his, characteristic, soberness, to, be, trivial, hertz, s, research, on, contact, mechanics, has, facilitated, the, age, of, nanotechnology, hertz, also, described, the, hertzian, cone, a, type, of, fracture, mode, in, brittle, solids, caused, by, the, transmission, of, stress, waves, hertz, always, had, a, deep, interest, in, meteorology, probably, derived, from, his, contacts, with, wilhelm, von, bezold, who, was, his, professor, in, a, laboratory, course, at, the, munich, polytechnic, in, the, summer, of, 1878, as, an, assistant, to, helmholtz, in, berlin, he, contributed, a, few, minor, articles, in, the, field, including, research, on, the, evaporation, of, liquids, a, new, kind, of, hygrometer, and, a, graphical, means, of, determining, the, properties, of, moist, air, when, subjected, to, adiabatic, changes, in, the, introduction, of, his, 1894, book, principles, of, mechanics, hertz, discusses, the, different, pictures, used, to, represent, physics, in, his, time, including, the, picture, of, newtonian, mechanics, based, on, mass, and, forces, a, second, picture, based, on, energy, conservation, and, hamilton, s, principle, and, his, own, picture, based, uniquely, on, space, time, mass, and, the, hertz, principle, comparing, them, in, terms, of, permissibility, correctness, and, appropriateness, hertz, wanted, to, remove, empty, assumptions, and, argue, against, the, newtonian, concept, of, force, and, against, action, at, a, distance, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, inspired, by, hertz, s, work, extended, his, picture, theory, into, a, picture, theory, of, language, in, his, 1921, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, which, influenced, logical, positivism, wittgenstein, also, quotes, him, in, the, blue, and, brown, books, because, hertz, s, family, converted, from, judaism, to, lutheranism, two, decades, before, his, birth, his, legacy, ran, afoul, of, the, nazi, government, in, the, 1930s, a, regime, that, classified, people, by, race, instead, of, religious, affiliation, hertz, s, name, was, removed, from, streets, and, institutions, and, there, was, even, a, movement, to, rename, the, frequency, unit, named, in, his, honor, hertz, after, hermann, von, helmholtz, instead, keeping, the, symbol, hz, unchanged, his, family, was, also, persecuted, for, their, non, aryan, status, hertz, s, youngest, daughter, mathilde, lost, a, lectureship, at, berlin, university, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, and, within, a, few, years, she, her, sister, and, their, mother, left, germany, and, settled, in, england, heinrich, hertz, s, nephew, gustav, ludwig, hertz, was, a, nobel, prize, winner, and, gustav, s, son, carl, helmut, hertz, invented, medical, ultrasonography, his, daughter, mathilde, carmen, hertz, was, a, well, known, biologist, and, comparative, psychologist, hertz, s, grandnephew, hermann, gerhard, hertz, professor, at, the, university, of, karlsruhe, was, a, pioneer, of, nmr, spectroscopy, and, in, 1995, published, hertz, s, laboratory, notes, the, si, unit, hertz, hz, was, established, in, his, honor, by, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, in, 1930, for, frequency, an, expression, of, the, number, of, times, that, a, repeated, event, occurs, per, second, it, was, adopted, by, the, cgpm, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, in, 1960, officially, replacing, the, previous, name, cycles, per, second, cps, in, 1928, the, heinrich, hertz, institute, for, oscillation, research, was, founded, in, berlin, today, known, as, the, fraunhofer, institute, for, telecommunications, heinrich, hertz, institute, hhi, in, 1969, in, east, germany, a, heinrich, hertz, memorial, medal, was, cast, the, ieee, heinrich, hertz, medal, established, in, 1987, is, for, outstanding, achievements, in, hertzian, waves, presented, annually, to, an, individual, for, achievements, which, are, theoretical, or, experimental, in, nature, the, submillimeter, radio, telescope, at, mt, graham, arizona, constructed, in, 1992, is, named, after, him, a, crater, that, lies, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, just, behind, the, eastern, limb, is, the, hertz, crater, named, in, his, honor, on, his, birthday, in, 2012, google, honored, hertz, with, a, google, doodle, inspired, by, his, life, s, work, on, its, home, page, lists, and, histories, electromagnetic, radiation, other
