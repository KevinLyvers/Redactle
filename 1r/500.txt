complained, that, gli, re, had, introduced, him, to, square, phrase, structure, and, conventional, modulations, which, he, subsequently, had, to, unlearn, nonetheless, equipped, with, the, necessary, theoretical, tools, prokofiev, started, experimenting, with, dissonant, harmonies, and, unusual, time, signatures, in, a, series, of, short, piano, pieces, he, called, ditties, after, the, so, called, song, form, more, accurately, ternary, form, on, which, they, were, based, laying, the, basis, for, his, own, musical, style, despite, his, growing, talent, prokofiev, s, parents, hesitated, over, starting, their, son, on, a, musical, career, at, such, an, early, age, and, considered, the, possibility, of, his, attending, a, good, high, school, in, moscow, by, 1904, his, mother, had, decided, instead, on, saint, petersburg, and, she, and, prokofiev, visited, the, then, capital, to, explore, the, possibility, of, moving, there, for, his, education, they, were, introduced, to, composer, alexander, glazunov, a, professor, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, who, asked, to, see, prokofiev, and, his, music, prokofiev, had, composed, two, more, operas, desert, islands, and, the, feast, during, the, plague, and, was, working, on, his, fourth, undina, glazunov, was, so, impressed, that, he, urged, prokofiev, s, mother, to, have, her, son, apply, for, admission, to, the, conservatory, he, passed, the, introductory, tests, and, enrolled, that, year, several, years, younger, than, most, of, his, class, prokofiev, was, viewed, as, eccentric, and, arrogant, and, annoyed, a, number, of, his, classmates, by, keeping, statistics, on, their, errors, during, that, period, he, studied, under, among, others, alexander, winkler, for, piano, anatoly, lyadov, for, harmony, and, counterpoint, nikolai, tcherepnin, for, conducting, and, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, for, orchestration, though, when, rimsky, korsakov, died, in, 1908, prokofiev, noted, that, he, had, only, studied, with, him, after, a, fashion, he, was, just, one, of, many, students, in, a, heavily, attended, class, and, regretted, that, he, otherwise, never, had, the, opportunity, to, study, with, him, he, also, shared, classes, with, the, composers, boris, asafyev, and, nikolai, myaskovsky, the, latter, becoming, a, close, and, lifelong, friend, as, a, member, of, the, saint, petersburg, music, scene, prokofiev, developed, a, reputation, as, a, musical, rebel, while, getting, praise, for, his, original, compositions, which, he, performed, himself, on, the, piano, in, 1909, he, graduated, from, his, class, in, composition, with, unimpressive, marks, he, continued, at, the, conservatory, studying, piano, under, anna, yesipova, and, continuing, his, conducting, lessons, under, tcherepnin, in, 1910, prokofiev, s, father, died, and, sergei, s, financial, support, ceased, fortunately, he, had, started, making, a, name, for, himself, as, a, composer, and, pianist, outside, the, conservatory, making, appearances, at, the, st, petersburg, evenings, of, contemporary, music, there, he, performed, several, of, his, more, adventurous, piano, works, such, as, his, highly, chromatic, and, dissonant, etudes, op, 2, 1909, his, performance, of, it, impressed, the, organisers, of, the, evenings, sufficiently, for, them, to, invite, prokofiev, to, give, the, russian, premiere, of, arnold, schoenberg, s, drei, klavierst, cke, op, 11, prokofiev, s, harmonic, experimentation, continued, with, sarcasms, for, piano, op, 17, 1912, which, makes, extensive, use, of, polytonality, he, composed, his, first, two, piano, concertos, around, then, the, latter, of, which, caused, a, scandal, at, its, premiere, 23, august, 1913, pavlovsk, according, to, one, account, the, audience, left, the, hall, with, exclamations, of, to, hell, with, this, futuristic, music, the, cats, on, the, roof, make, better, music, but, the, modernists, were, in, rapture, in, 1911, help, arrived, from, renowned, russian, musicologist, and, critic, alexander, ossovsky, who, wrote, a, supportive, letter, to, music, publisher, boris, p, jurgenson, son, of, publishing, firm, founder, peter, jurgenson, thus, a, contract, was, offered, to, the, composer, prokofiev, made, his, first, foreign, trip, in, 1913, travelling, to, paris, and, london, where, he, first, encountered, sergei, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, in, 1914, prokofiev, finished, his, career, at, the, conservatory, by, entering, the, battle, of, the, pianos, a, competition, open, to, the, five, best, piano, students, for, which, the, prize, was, a, schroeder, grand, piano, prokofiev, won, by, performing, his, own, piano, concerto, no, 1, soon, afterwards, he, journeyed, to, london, where, he, made, contact, with, the, impresario, sergei, diaghilev, diaghilev, commissioned, prokofiev, s, first, ballet, ala, and, lolli, but, when, prokofiev, brought, the, work, in, progress, to, him, in, italy, in, 1915, he, rejected, it, as, non, russian, urging, prokofiev, to, write, music, that, was, national, in, character, diaghilev, then, commissioned, the, ballet, chout, the, buffoon, the, original, russian, language, full, title, was, meaning, the, tale, of, the, buffoon, who, outwits, seven, other, buffoons, under, diaghilev, s, guidance, prokofiev, chose, his, subject, from, a, collection, of, folk, tales, by, the, ethnographer, alexander, afanasyev, the, story, concerning, a, buffoon, and, a, series, of, confidence, tricks, had, been, previously, suggested, to, diaghilev, by, igor, stravinsky, as, a, possible, subject, for, a, ballet, and, diaghilev, and, his, choreographer, l, onide, massine, helped, prokofiev, to, shape, it, into, a, ballet, scenario, prokofiev, s, inexperience, with, ballet, led, him, to, revise, the, work, extensively, in, the, 1920s, following, diaghilev, s, detailed, critique, prior, to, its, first, production, the, ballet, s, premiere, in, paris, on, 17, may, 1921, was, a, huge, success, and, was, greeted, with, great, admiration, by, an, audience, that, included, jean, cocteau, igor, stravinsky, and, maurice, ravel, stravinsky, called, the, ballet, the, single, piece, of, modern, music, he, could, listen, to, with, pleasure, while, ravel, called, it, a, work, of, genius, during, world, war, i, prokofiev, returned, to, the, conservatory, and, studied, organ, to, avoid, conscription, in, 1916, he, debuted, his, toccata, shortly, after, this, he, composed, the, gambler, based, on, fyodor, dostoyevsky, s, novel, of, the, same, name, but, rehearsals, were, plagued, by, problems, and, the, scheduled, 1917, premi, re, had, to, be, cancelled, because, of, the, february, revolution, in, the, summer, of, that, year, prokofiev, composed, his, first, symphony, the, classical, the, name, was, prokofiev, s, own, the, music, is, in, a, style, that, according, to, prokofiev, joseph, haydn, would, have, used, if, he, were, alive, at, the, time, the, music, is, more, or, less, classical, in, style, but, incorporates, more, modern, musical, elements, see, neoclassicism, the, symphony, was, also, an, exact, contemporary, of, prokofiev, s, violin, concerto, no, 1, in, d, major, op, 19, which, was, scheduled, to, premiere, in, november, 1917, the, first, performances, of, both, works, had, to, wait, until, 21, april, 1918, and, 18, october, 1923, respectively, prokofiev, stayed, briefly, with, his, mother, in, kislovodsk, in, the, caucasus, after, completing, the, score, of, seven, they, are, seven, a, chaldean, invocation, for, chorus, and, orchestra, prokofiev, was, left, with, nothing, to, do, and, time, hung, heavily, on, my, hands, believing, that, russia, had, no, use, for, music, at, the, moment, prokofiev, decided, to, try, his, fortunes, in, america, until, the, turmoil, in, his, homeland, had, passed, he, set, out, for, moscow, and, petersburg, in, march, 1918, to, sort, out, financial, matters, and, to, arrange, for, his, passport, in, may, he, headed, for, the, us, having, obtained, official, permission, to, do, so, from, anatoly, lunacharsky, the, people, s, commissar, for, education, who, told, him, you, are, a, revolutionary, in, music, we, are, revolutionaries, in, life, we, ought, to, work, together, but, if, you, want, to, go, to, america, i, shall, not, stand, in, your, way, arriving, in, san, francisco, after, having, been, released, from, questioning, by, immigration, officials, on, angel, island, on, 11, august, 1918, prokofiev, was, soon, compared, to, other, famous, russian, exiles, such, as, sergei, rachmaninoff, his, debut, solo, concert, in, new, york, led, to, several, further, engagements, he, also, received, a, contract, from, the, music, director, of, the, chicago, opera, association, cleofonte, campanini, for, the, production, of, his, new, opera, the, love, for, three, oranges, but, due, to, campanini, s, illness, and, death, the, premiere, was, postponed, the, delay, was, another, example, of, prokofiev, s, bad, luck, in, operatic, matters, the, failure, also, cost, him, his, american, solo, career, since, the, opera, took, too, much, time, and, effort, he, soon, found, himself, in, financial, difficulties, and, in, april, 1920, he, left, for, paris, not, wanting, to, return, to, russia, as, a, failure, in, paris, prokofiev, reaffirmed, his, contacts, with, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, he, also, completed, some, of, his, older, unfinished, works, such, as, his, third, piano, concerto, the, love, for, three, oranges, finally, premi, red, in, chicago, under, the, composer, s, baton, on, 30, december, 1921, diaghilev, became, sufficiently, interested, in, the, opera, to, request, prokofiev, play, the, vocal, score, to, him, in, june, 1922, while, they, were, both, in, paris, for, a, revival, of, chout, so, he, could, consider, it, for, a, possible, production, stravinsky, who, was, present, at, the, audition, refused, to, listen, to, more, than, the, first, act, when, he, then, accused, prokofiev, of, wasting, time, composing, operas, prokofiev, retorted, that, stravinsky, was, in, no, position, to, lay, down, a, general, artistic, direction, since, he, is, himself, not, immune, to, error, according, to, prokofiev, stravinsky, became, incandescent, with, rage, and, we, almost, came, to, blows, and, were, separated, only, with, difficulty, as, a, result, our, relations, became, strained, and, for, several, years, stravinsky, s, attitude, toward, me, was, critical, in, march, 1922, prokofiev, moved, with, his, mother, to, the, town, of, ettal, in, the, bavarian, alps, where, for, over, a, year, he, concentrated, on, an, opera, project, the, fiery, angel, based, on, the, novel, by, valery, bryusov, his, later, music, had, acquired, a, following, in, russia, and, he, received, invitations, to, return, there, but, decided, to, stay, in, europe, in, 1923, prokofiev, married, the, spanish, singer, carolina, codina, 1897, 1989, stage, name, lina, llubera, before, moving, back, to, paris, in, paris, several, of, his, works, including, the, second, symphony, were, performed, but, their, reception, was, lukewarm, and, prokofiev, sensed, that, he, was, evidently, no, longer, a, sensation, still, the, symphony, appeared, to, prompt, diaghilev, to, commission, le, pas, d, acier, the, steel, step, a, modernist, ballet, score, intended, to, portray, the, industrialisation, of, the, soviet, union, it, was, enthusiastically, received, by, parisian, audiences, and, critics, around, 1924, prokofiev, was, introduced, to, christian, science, he, began, to, practice, its, teachings, which, he, believed, to, be, beneficial, to, his, health, and, to, his, fiery, temperament, and, to, which, he, remained, faithful, for, the, rest, of, his, life, according, to, biographer, simon, morrison, prokofiev, and, stravinsky, restored, their, friendship, though, prokofiev, particularly, disliked, stravinsky, s, stylization, of, bach, in, such, recent, works, as, the, octet, and, the, concerto, for, piano, and, wind, instruments, for, his, part, stravinsky, described, prokofiev, as, the, greatest, russian, composer, of, his, day, after, himself, prokofiev, met, boris, krasin, in, the, violinist, joseph, szigeti, s, paris, apartment, in, 1924, in, 1927, prokofiev, made, his, first, concert, tour, in, the, soviet, union, over, more, than, two, months, he, spent, time, in, moscow, and, leningrad, as, st, petersburg, had, been, renamed, where, he, enjoyed, a, very, successful, staging, of, the, love, for, three, oranges, in, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, 1928, prokofiev, completed, his, third, symphony, which, was, broadly, based, on, his, unperformed, opera, the, fiery, angel, the, conductor, serge, koussevitzky, characterized, the, third, as, the, greatest, symphony, since, tchaikovsky, s, sixth, in, the, meantime, under, the, influence, of, the, teachings, of, christian, science, prokofiev, had, turned, against, the, expressionist, style, and, the, subject, matter, of, the, fiery, angel, he, now, preferred, what, he, called, a, new, simplicity, which, he, found, more, sincere, than, the, contrivances, and, complexities, of, so, much, modern, music, of, the, 1920s, in, 1928, 29, prokofiev, composed, his, last, ballet, for, diaghilev, the, prodigal, son, when, first, staged, in, paris, on, 21, may, 1929, choreographed, by, george, balanchine, with, serge, lifar, in, the, title, role, the, audience, and, critics, were, particularly, struck, by, the, final, scene, in, which, the, prodigal, son, drags, himself, across, the, stage, on, his, knees, to, be, welcomed, by, his, father, diaghilev, had, recognised, that, in, the, music, to, the, scene, prokofiev, had, never, been, more, clear, more, simple, more, melodious, and, more, tender, only, months, later, diaghilev, died, that, summer, prokofiev, completed, the, divertimento, op, 43, which, he, had, started, in, 1925, and, revised, his, sinfonietta, op, 5, 48, a, work, started, in, his, days, at, the, conservatory, in, october, of, that, year, he, had, a, car, crash, while, driving, his, family, back, to, paris, from, their, holiday, as, the, car, turned, over, prokofiev, pulled, some, muscles, on, his, left, hand, prokofiev, was, therefore, unable, to, perform, in, moscow, during, his, tour, shortly, after, the, accident, but, he, was, able, to, enjoy, watching, performances, of, his, music, from, the, audience, prokofiev, also, attended, the, bolshoi, theatre, s, audition, of, his, ballet, le, pas, d, acier, and, was, interrogated, by, members, of, the, russian, association, of, proletarian, musicians, rapm, about, the, work, he, was, asked, whether, the, factory, portrayed, a, capitalist, factory, where, the, worker, is, a, slave, or, a, soviet, factory, where, the, worker, is, the, master, if, it, is, a, soviet, factory, when, and, where, did, prokofiev, examine, it, since, from, 1918, to, the, present, he, has, been, living, abroad, and, came, here, for, the, first, time, in, 1927, for, two, weeks, prokofiev, replied, that, concerns, politics, not, music, and, therefore, i, won, t, answer, the, rapm, condemned, the, ballet, as, a, flat, and, vulgar, anti, soviet, anecdote, a, counter, revolutionary, composition, bordering, on, fascism, the, bolshoi, had, no, option, but, to, reject, the, ballet, with, his, left, hand, healed, prokofiev, toured, the, united, states, successfully, at, the, start, of, 1930, propped, up, by, his, recent, european, success, that, year, prokofiev, began, his, first, non, diaghilev, ballet, on, the, dnieper, op, 51, a, work, commissioned, by, serge, lifar, who, had, been, appointed, maitre, de, ballet, at, the, paris, op, ra, in, 1931, and, 1932, he, completed, his, fourth, and, fifth, piano, concertos, the, following, year, saw, the, completion, of, the, symphonic, song, op, 57, which, prokofiev, s, friend, myaskovsky, thinking, of, its, potential, audience, in, the, soviet, union, told, him, isn, t, quite, for, us, it, lacks, that, which, we, mean, by, monumentalism, a, familiar, simplicity, and, broad, contours, of, which, you, are, extremely, capable, but, temporarily, are, carefully, avoiding, by, the, early, 1930s, both, europe, and, america, were, suffering, from, the, great, depression, which, inhibited, both, new, opera, and, ballet, productions, though, audiences, for, prokofiev, s, appearances, as, a, pianist, were, in, europe, at, least, undiminished, but, prokofiev, saw, himself, as, a, composer, first, and, foremost, and, increasingly, resented, the, time, lost, to, composition, through, his, appearances, as, a, pianist, having, been, homesick, for, some, time, prokofiev, began, to, build, substantial, bridges, with, the, soviet, union, following, the, dissolution, of, the, rapm, in, 1932, he, acted, increasingly, as, a, musical, ambassador, between, his, homeland, and, western, europe, and, his, premieres, and, commissions, were, increasingly, under, the, auspices, of, the, soviet, union, one, such, was, lieutenant, kij, which, was, commissioned, as, the, score, to, a, soviet, film, another, commission, from, the, kirov, theatre, as, the, mariinsky, had, now, been, renamed, in, leningrad, was, the, ballet, romeo, and, juliet, composed, to, a, scenario, created, by, adrian, piotrovsky, and, sergei, radlov, following, the, precepts, of, drambalet, dramatised, ballet, officially, promoted, at, the, kirov, to, replace, works, based, primarily, on, choreographic, display,
