central, advisory, commission, and, was, succeeded, by, chen, yun, deng, continued, to, chair, and, develop, the, reform, and, opening, up, as, the, main, policy, and, he, advanced, the, three, steps, suitable, for, china, s, economic, development, strategy, within, seventy, years, the, first, step, to, double, the, 1980, gnp, and, ensure, that, the, people, have, enough, food, and, clothing, was, attained, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, the, second, step, to, quadruple, the, 1980, gnp, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, was, achieved, in, 1995, ahead, of, schedule, the, third, step, to, increase, per, capita, gnp, to, the, level, of, the, medium, developed, countries, by, 2050, at, which, point, the, chinese, people, will, be, fairly, well, off, and, modernization, will, be, basically, realized, improving, relations, with, the, outside, world, was, the, second, of, two, important, philosophical, shifts, outlined, in, deng, s, program, of, reform, termed, gaige, kaifang, lit, reforms, and, openness, china, s, domestic, social, political, and, most, notably, economic, systems, would, undergo, significant, changes, during, deng, s, time, the, goals, of, deng, s, reforms, were, summed, up, by, the, four, modernizations, those, of, agriculture, industry, science, and, technology, and, the, military, the, strategy, for, achieving, these, aims, of, becoming, a, modern, industrial, nation, was, the, socialist, market, economy, deng, argued, that, china, was, in, the, primary, stage, of, socialism, and, that, the, duty, of, the, party, was, to, perfect, so, called, socialism, with, chinese, characteristics, and, seek, truth, from, facts, this, somewhat, resembles, the, leninist, theoretical, justification, of, the, new, economic, policy, nep, in, the, 1920s, which, argued, that, the, soviet, union, had, not, gone, deeply, enough, into, the, capitalist, phase, and, therefore, needed, limited, capitalism, in, order, to, fully, evolve, its, means, of, production, the, socialism, with, chinese, characteristics, settles, a, benign, structure, for, the, implementation, of, ethnic, policy, and, forming, a, unique, method, of, ethnic, theory, deng, s, economic, policy, prioritized, developing, china, s, productive, forces, in, deng, s, view, this, development, is, the, most, fundamental, revolution, from, the, viewpoint, of, historical, development, and, oor, socialism, is, not, socialism, his, theoretical, justification, for, allowing, market, forces, was, the, proportion, of, planning, to, market, forces, is, not, the, essential, difference, between, socialism, and, capitalism, a, planned, economy, is, not, equivalent, to, socialism, because, there, is, planning, under, capitalism, too, a, market, economy, is, not, capitalism, because, there, are, markets, under, socialism, too, planning, and, market, forces, are, both, means, of, controlling, economic, activity, the, essence, of, socialism, is, liberation, and, development, of, the, productive, forces, elimination, of, exploitation, and, polarisation, and, the, ultimate, achievement, of, prosperity, for, all, this, concept, must, be, made, clear, to, the, people, unlike, hua, guofeng, deng, believed, that, no, policy, should, be, rejected, outright, simply, because, it, was, not, associated, with, mao, unlike, more, conservative, leaders, such, as, chen, yun, deng, did, not, object, to, policies, on, the, grounds, that, they, were, similar, to, ones, that, were, found, in, capitalist, nations, this, political, flexibility, towards, the, foundations, of, socialism, is, strongly, supported, by, quotes, such, as, we, mustn, t, fear, to, adopt, the, advanced, management, methods, applied, in, capitalist, countries, the, very, essence, of, socialism, is, the, liberation, and, development, of, the, productive, systems, socialism, and, market, economy, are, not, incompatible, we, should, be, concerned, about, right, wing, deviations, but, most, of, all, we, must, be, concerned, about, left, wing, deviations, although, deng, provided, the, theoretical, background, and, the, political, support, to, allow, economic, reform, to, occur, the, general, consensus, amongst, historians, is, that, few, of, the, economic, reforms, that, deng, introduced, were, originated, by, deng, himself, premier, zhou, enlai, for, example, pioneered, the, four, modernizations, years, before, deng, in, addition, many, reforms, would, be, introduced, by, local, leaders, often, not, sanctioned, by, central, government, directives, if, successful, and, promising, these, reforms, would, be, adopted, by, larger, and, larger, areas, and, ultimately, introduced, nationally, an, often, cited, example, is, the, household, responsibility, system, which, was, first, secretly, implemented, by, a, poor, rural, village, at, the, risk, of, being, convicted, as, counter, revolutionary, this, experiment, proved, very, successful, deng, openly, supported, it, and, it, was, later, adopted, nationally, many, other, reforms, were, influenced, by, the, experiences, of, the, east, asian, tigers, this, was, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, pattern, of, perestroika, undertaken, by, mikhail, gorbachev, in, which, most, major, reforms, originated, with, gorbachev, himself, the, bottom, up, approach, of, deng, s, reforms, in, contrast, to, the, top, down, approach, of, perestroika, was, likely, a, key, factor, in, the, success, of, the, former, deng, s, reforms, actually, included, the, introduction, of, planned, centralized, management, of, the, macro, economy, by, technically, proficient, bureaucrats, abandoning, mao, s, mass, campaign, style, of, economic, construction, however, unlike, the, soviet, model, management, was, indirect, through, market, mechanisms, deng, sustained, mao, s, legacy, to, the, extent, that, he, stressed, the, primacy, of, agricultural, output, and, encouraged, a, significant, decentralization, of, decision, making, in, the, rural, economy, teams, and, individual, peasant, households, at, the, local, level, material, incentives, rather, than, political, appeals, were, to, be, used, to, motivate, the, labor, force, including, allowing, peasants, to, earn, extra, income, by, selling, the, produce, of, their, private, plots, at, free, market, value, in, the, move, toward, market, allocation, local, municipalities, and, provinces, were, allowed, to, invest, in, industries, that, they, considered, most, profitable, which, encouraged, investment, in, light, manufacturing, thus, deng, s, reforms, shifted, china, s, development, strategy, to, an, emphasis, on, light, industry, and, export, led, growth, light, industrial, output, was, vital, for, a, developing, country, coming, from, a, low, capital, base, with, the, short, gestation, period, low, capital, requirements, and, high, foreign, exchange, export, earnings, revenues, generated, by, light, manufacturing, were, able, to, be, reinvested, in, technologically, more, advanced, production, and, further, capital, expenditures, and, investments, however, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, similar, but, much, less, successful, reforms, in, the, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, and, the, people, s, republic, of, hungary, these, investments, were, not, government, mandated, the, capital, invested, in, heavy, industry, largely, came, from, the, banking, system, and, most, of, that, capital, came, from, consumer, deposits, one, of, the, first, items, of, the, deng, reforms, was, to, prevent, reallocation, of, profits, except, through, taxation, or, through, the, banking, system, hence, the, reallocation, in, state, owned, industries, was, somewhat, indirect, thus, making, them, more, or, less, independent, from, government, interference, in, short, deng, s, reforms, sparked, an, industrial, revolution, in, china, these, reforms, were, a, reversal, of, the, maoist, policy, of, economic, self, reliance, china, decided, to, accelerate, the, modernization, process, by, stepping, up, the, volume, of, foreign, trade, especially, the, purchase, of, machinery, from, japan, and, the, west, in, october, 1978, to, exchange, the, instruments, of, ratification, for, the, treaty, of, peace, and, friendship, between, japan, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, deng, xiaoping, visited, japan, for, the, first, time, and, was, warmly, received, by, prime, minister, takeo, fukuda, and, others, deng, xiaoping, was, only, vice, premier, during, the, time, of, his, meetings, with, japanese, officials, but, the, japanese, government, received, deng, as, the, effective, paramount, leader, of, china, due, to, his, long, history, with, the, ccp, nonetheless, deng, was, deemed, the, first, chinese, leader, to, receive, an, audience, in, addition, to, japanese, emperor, showa, a, news, article, from, nhk, japan, in, 1978, reported, that, deng, diplomatically, stated, we, talked, about, our, past, but, his, majesty, s, focus, on, building, a, better, future, is, something, i, noticed, deng, s, statement, suggests, the, new, era, of, china, s, political, reform, through, foreign, economic, diplomacy, treaty, of, peace, and, friendship, between, japan, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, is, an, ongoing, pact, between, the, two, nations, to, this, day, article, 1, of, the, treaty, describes, mutual, respect, for, sovereignty, and, territorial, integrity, mutual, non, aggression, and, mutual, non, interference, in, internal, affairs, article, 2, proclaims, anti, hegemony, article, 3, discusses, the, further, development, of, economic, and, cultural, relations, between, the, two, countries, and, article, 4, addresses, the, relationship, of, this, treaty, with, third, countries, although, it, took, six, years, from, the, restoration, of, diplomatic, relations, for, the, peace, treaty, negotiations, to, be, concluded, as, the, anti, hegemony, clause, and, the, third, country, clause, were, considered, the, most, contentious, the, agreement, still, informs, much, of, contemporary, sino, japanese, relations, by, participating, in, such, export, led, growth, china, was, able, to, step, up, the, four, modernizations, by, attaining, certain, foreign, funds, market, advanced, technologies, and, management, experiences, thus, accelerating, its, economic, development, from, 1980, deng, attracted, foreign, companies, to, a, series, of, special, economic, zones, where, foreign, investment, and, market, liberalization, were, encouraged, the, reforms, sought, to, improve, labor, productivity, new, material, incentives, and, bonus, systems, were, introduced, rural, markets, selling, peasants, homegrown, products, and, the, surplus, products, of, communes, were, revived, not, only, did, rural, markets, increase, agricultural, output, they, stimulated, industrial, development, as, well, with, peasants, able, to, sell, surplus, agricultural, yields, on, the, open, market, domestic, consumption, stimulated, industrialization, as, well, and, also, created, political, support, for, more, difficult, economic, reforms, there, are, some, parallels, between, deng, s, market, socialism, especially, in, the, early, stages, and, vladimir, lenin, s, nep, as, well, as, those, of, nikolai, bukharin, s, economic, policies, in, that, both, foresaw, a, role, for, private, entrepreneurs, and, markets, based, on, trade, and, pricing, rather, than, central, planning, as, academics, christopher, marquis, and, kunyuan, qiao, observe, deng, had, been, present, in, the, soviet, union, when, lenin, implemented, the, nep, and, it, is, reasonable, to, infer, that, it, may, have, impacted, deng, s, view, that, markets, could, exist, within, socialism, 254, in, first, meeting, between, deng, and, armand, hammer, deng, pressed, the, industrialist, and, former, investor, in, lenin, s, soviet, union, for, as, much, information, on, the, new, economic, policy, as, possible, from, 1980, onwards, deng, led, the, expansion, of, the, economy, and, in, political, terms, took, over, negotiations, with, the, united, kingdom, to, return, hong, kong, meeting, personally, with, then, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, thatcher, had, participated, in, the, meetings, with, the, hopes, of, keeping, british, rule, over, hong, kong, island, and, kowloon, two, of, the, three, constituent, territories, of, the, colony, but, this, was, firmly, rejected, by, deng, the, result, of, these, negotiations, was, the, sino, british, joint, declaration, signed, on, 19, december, 1984, which, formally, outlined, the, united, kingdom, s, return, of, the, whole, hong, kong, colony, to, china, by, 1997, the, chinese, government, pledged, to, respect, the, economic, system, and, civil, liberties, of, the, british, colony, for, fifty, years, after, the, handover, deng, s, theory, of, one, country, two, systems, applied, to, hong, kong, and, macau, and, deng, intended, to, also, present, it, as, an, attractive, option, to, the, people, of, taiwan, for, eventual, incorporation, of, that, island, where, sovereignty, over, the, territory, is, still, disputed, in, 1982, deng, first, explained, the, concept, of, one, country, two, systems, in, relation, to, taiwan, 231, deng, s, statements, during, the, 1987, drafting, of, the, basic, law, of, hong, kong, showed, his, view, of, the, principle, in, the, hong, kong, context, 176, at, that, time, deng, stated, that, the, central, government, would, not, intervene, in, the, daily, business, of, hong, kong, but, predicted, hong, kong, would, sometimes, have, issues, affecting, national, interests, that, would, require, the, central, government, s, involvement, 178, 179, deng, said, after, 1997, we, shall, still, allow, people, in, hong, kong, to, attack, the, communist, party, of, china, and, china, verbally, but, what, if, the, words, were, turned, into, action, trying, to, convert, hong, kong, into, a, base, of, opposition, to, the, chinese, mainland, under, the, pretext, of, democracy, then, there, s, no, choice, but, intervention, in, june, 1988, deng, stated, that, hong, kong, s, political, system, today, is, neither, the, british, system, nor, the, american, system, and, it, should, not, transplant, the, western, ways, in, the, future, 179, china, s, rapid, economic, growth, presented, several, problems, the, 1982, census, revealed, the, extraordinary, growth, of, the, population, which, already, exceeded, a, billion, people, deng, continued, the, plans, initiated, by, hua, guofeng, to, restrict, birth, to, only, one, child, limiting, women, to, one, child, under, pain, of, administrative, penalty, the, policy, applied, to, urban, areas, and, included, forced, abortions, in, august, 1983, deng, launched, the, strike, hard, anti, crime, campaign, due, to, the, worsening, public, safety, after, the, cultural, revolution, it, was, reported, that, the, government, set, quotas, for, 5, 000, executions, by, mid, november, and, sources, in, taiwan, claimed, that, as, many, as, 60, 000, people, were, executed, in, that, time, although, more, recent, estimates, have, placed, the, number, at, 24, 000, who, were, sentenced, to, death, mostly, in, the, first, battle, of, the, campaign, a, number, of, people, arrested, some, even, received, death, penalty, were, children, or, relatives, of, government, officials, at, various, levels, including, the, grandson, of, zhu, de, demonstrating, the, principle, of, all, are, equal, before, the, law, the, campaign, had, an, immediate, positive, effect, on, public, safety, while, controversies, also, arose, such, as, whether, some, of, the, legal, punishments, were, too, harsh, and, whether, the, campaign, had, long, term, positive, effect, on, public, safety, increasing, economic, freedom, was, being, translated, into, a, greater, freedom, of, opinion, and, critics, began, to, arise, within, the, system, including, the, famous, dissident, wei, jingsheng, who, coined, the, term, fifth, modernization, in, reference, to, democracy, as, a, missing, element, in, the, renewal, plans, of, deng, xiaoping, in, the, late, 1980s, dissatisfaction, with, the, authoritarian, regime, and, growing, inequalities, caused, the, biggest, crisis, to, deng, s,

official, backed, by, deng, but, ousted, by, the, eight, elders, and, the, conservative, wing, of, the, politburo, many, people, were, dissatisfied, with, the, party, s, slow, response, and, relatively, subdued, funeral, arrangements, public, mourning, began, on, the, streets, of, beijing, and, universities, in, the, surrounding, areas, in, beijing, this, was, centered, on, the, monument, to, the, people, s, heroes, in, tiananmen, square, the, mourning, became, a, public, conduit, for, anger, against, perceived, nepotism, in, the, government, the, unfair, dismissal, and, early, death, of, hu, and, the, behind, the, scenes, role, of, the, old, men, by, the, eve, of, hu, s, funeral, the, demonstration, had, reached, 100, 000, people, on, tiananmen, square, while, the, protests, lacked, a, unified, cause, or, leadership, participants, raised, the, issue, of, corruption, within, the, government, and, some, voiced, calls, for, economic, liberalization, and, democratic, reform, within, the, structure, of, the, government, while, others, called, for, a, less, authoritarian, and, less, centralized, form, of, socialism, during, the, demonstrations, deng, s, pro, market, ally,

tanks, and, helicopters, were, sent, into, the, city, to, quell, the, protests, by, force, resulting, in, hundreds, to, thousands, of, casualties, many, ordinary, people, in, beijing, believed, that, deng, had, ordered, the, intervention, but, political, analysts, do, not, know, who, was, actually, behind, the, order, however, deng, s, daughter, defends, the, actions, that, occurred, as, a, collective, decision, by, the, party, leadership, to, purge, sympathizers, of, tiananmen, demonstrators, the, communist, party, initiated, a, one, and, a, half, year, long, program, similar, to, the, anti, rightist, movement, old, timers, like, deng, fei, aimed, to, deal, strictly, with, those, inside, the, party, with, serious, tendencies, toward, bourgeois, liberalization, and, more, than, 30, 000, communist, officers, were, deployed, to, the, task, zhao, was, placed, under, house, arrest, by, hardliners, and, deng, himself, was, forced, to, make, concessions, to, them, he, soon, declared, that, the, entire, imperialist, western, world, plans, to, make, all, socialist, countries, discard, the, socialist, road, and, then, bring, them, under, the, monopoly, of, international, capital, and, onto, the, capitalist, road, a, few, months, later, he, said, that, the, united, states, was, too, deeply, involved, in, the, student, movement, referring, to, foreign, reporters, who, had, given, financial, aid, to, the, student, leaders, and, later, helped, them, escape, to, various, western, countries, primarily, the, united, states, through, hong, kong, and, taiwan, although, deng, initially, made, concessions, to, the, socialist, hardliners, he, soon, resumed, his, reforms, after, his, 1992, southern, tour, after, his, tour, he, was, able, to, stop, the, attacks, of, the, socialist, hardliners, on, the, reforms, through, their, named, capitalist, or, socialist, campaign, deng, privately, told, former, canadian, prime, minister, pierre, trudeau, that, factions, of, the, communist, party, could, have, grabbed, army, units, and, the, country, had, risked, a, civil, war, two, years, later, deng, endorsed, zhu, rongji, a, shanghai, mayor, as, a, vice, premier, candidate, zhu, rongji, had, refused, to, declare, martial, law, in, shanghai, during, the, demonstrations, even, though, socialist, hardliners, had, pressured, him, officially, deng, decided, to, retire, from, top, positions, when, he, stepped, down, as, chairman, of, the, central, military, commission, in, november, 1989, and, his, successor, jiang, zemin, became, the, new, chairman, of, the, central,

communist, party, he, was, believed, to, have, set, a, good, example, for, communist, cadres, who, refused, to, retire, at, old, age, he, broke, earlier, conventions, of, holding, offices, for, life, he, was, often, referred, to, as, simply, comrade, xiaoping, with, no, title, attached, because, of, the, 1989, tiananmen, square, protests, deng, s, power, had, been, significantly, weakened, and, there, was, a, growing, formalist, faction, opposed, to, deng, s, reforms, within, the, communist, party, to, reassert, his, economic, agenda, in, the, spring, of, 1992, deng, made, a, tour, of, southern, china, visiting, guangzhou, shenzhen, zhuhai, and, spending, the, new, year, in, shanghai, using, his, travels, as, a, method, of, reasserting, his, economic, policy, after, his, retirement, from, office, the, 1992, southern, tour, is, widely, regarded, as, a, critical, point, in, the, modern, history, of, china, as, it, saved, the, chinese, economic, reform, and, preserved, the, stability, of, the, society, deng, s, health, deteriorated, drastically, since, 1994, in, january, 1995, deng, s, daughter, told, the, press, that, a, year, ago, he, could, walk, for, 30, minutes,
