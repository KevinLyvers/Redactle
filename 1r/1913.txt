an, australian, international, cricketer, widely, acknowledged, as, the, greatest, batsman, of, all, time, his, cricketing, successes, have, been, claimed, by, shane, warne, among, others, to, make, bradman, the, greatest, sportsperson, in, history, bradman, s, career, test, batting, average, of, 99, 94, is, considered, by, some, to, be, the, greatest, achievement, by, any, sportsman, in, any, major, sport, although, bradman, reportedly, disliked, fame, his, iconic, status, made, him, one, of, australia, s, best, known, personalities, and, arguably, the, country, s, first, celebrity, the, story, that, the, young, bradman, practised, alone, with, a, cricket, stump, and, a, golf, ball, is, part, of, australian, folklore, his, meteoric, rise, from, bush, cricket, to, the, australian, test, team, took, just, over, two, years, before, his, 22nd, birthday, he, had, set, many, records, for, top, scoring, some, of, which, still, stand, and, became, australia, s, sporting, idol, at, the, height, of, the, great, depression, this, hero, status, grew, and, continued, through, the, second, world, war, during, a, 20, year, playing, career, bradman, consistently, scored, at, a, level, that, made, him, in, the, words, of, former, australia, captain, bill, woodfull, worth, three, batsmen, to, australia, a, controversial, set, of, tactics, known, as, bodyline, was, specially, devised, by, the, england, team, to, curb, his, scoring, as, a, captain, and, administrator, bradman, was, committed, to, attacking, entertaining, cricket, he, drew, spectators, in, record, numbers, he, hated, the, constant, adulation, however, and, it, affected, how, he, dealt, with, others, the, focus, of, attention, on, bradman, s, individual, performances, strained, relationships, with, some, teammates, administrators, and, journalists, who, thought, him, aloof, and, wary, following, an, enforced, hiatus, due, to, the, second, world, war, he, made, a, dramatic, comeback, captaining, an, australian, team, known, as, the, invincibles, on, a, record, breaking, unbeaten, tour, of, england, a, complex, and, highly, driven, man, not, given, to, close, personal, relationships, bradman, retained, a, pre, eminent, position, in, the, game, by, acting, as, an, administrator, selector, and, writer, for, three, decades, following, his, retirement, even, after, he, became, reclusive, in, his, declining, years, bradman, s, opinion, was, highly, sought, and, his, status, as, a, national, icon, was, still, recognised, almost, fifty, years, after, his, retirement, as, a, test, player, in, 1997, prime, minister, john, howard, called, him, the, greatest, living, australian, bradman, s, image, has, appeared, on, postage, stamps, and, coins, and, a, museum, dedicated, to, his, life, was, opened, while, he, was, still, living, on, the, centenary, of, his, birth, 27, august, 2008, the, royal, australian, mint, issued, a, 5, commemorative, gold, coin, with, bradman, s, image, in, 2009,

the, cootamundra, home, of, granny, scholz, a, midwife, which, is, now, the, bradman, birthplace, museum, bradman, s, mother, had, hailed, from, mittagong, in, the, nsw, southern, highlands, and, in, 1911, when, bradman, was, about, two, and, a, half, years, old, his, parents, decided, to, relocate, to, bowral, close, to, emily, s, family, and, friends, in, mittagong, as, life, at, yeo, yeo, was, proving, difficult, emily, who, bowled, left, arm, spin, played, in, the, women, s, intercolonial, cricket, competition, between, the, main, states, in, 1890s, bradman, practised, batting, incessantly, during, his, youth, he, invented, his, own, solo, cricket, game, using, a, cricket, stump, for, a, bat, and, a, golf, ball, a, water, tank, mounted, on, a, curved, brick, stand, stood, on, a, paved, area, behind, the, family, home, when, hit, into, the, curved, brick, facing, of, the, stand, the, ball, rebounded, at, high, speed, and, varying, angles, and, bradman, would, attempt, to, hit, it, again, this, form, of, practice, developed, his, timing, and, reactions, to, a, high, degree, in, more, formal, cricket, bradman, hit, his, first, century, at, the, age, of, 12, with, an, undefeated, 115, playing, for, bowral, public, school, against, mittagong, high, school, during, the, 1920, 21, season, bradman, acted, as, scorer, for, the, local, bowral, team, captained, by, his, uncle, george, whatman, in, october, 1920, he, filled, in, when, the, team, was, one, man, short, scoring, 37, and, 29, on, debut, during, the, season, bradman, s, father, took, him, to, the, sydney, cricket, ground, scg, to, watch, the, fifth, ashes, test, match, on, that, day, bradman, formed, an, ambition, telling, his, father, i, shall, never, be, satisfied, until, i, play, on, this, ground, bradman, left, school, in, 1922, and, went, to, work, for, a, local, real, estate, agent, who, encouraged, his, sporting, pursuits, by, giving, him, time, off, when, necessary, he, gave, up, cricket, in, favour, of, tennis, for, two, years, but, resumed, playing, cricket, in, 1925, 26, bradman, became, a, regular, selection, for, the, bowral, team, several, outstanding, performances, earned, him, the, attention, of, sydney, newspapers, competing, on, matting, over, concrete, pitches, bowral, played, other, rural, towns, in, the, berrima, district, competition, against, wingello, a, team, that, included, the, future, test, bowler, bill, o, reilly, bradman, made, 234, in, the, competition, final, against, moss, vale, which, extended, over, five, consecutive, saturdays, bradman, scored, 320, not, out, during, the, following, australian, winter, 1926, the, ageing, australian, team, lost, the, ashes, in, england, and, a, number, of, test, players, retired, the, new, south, wales, cricket, association, began, a, hunt, for, new, talent, mindful, of, bradman, s, big, scores, for, bowral, the, association, wrote, to, him, requesting, his, attendance, at, a, practice, session, in, sydney, he, was, subsequently, chosen, for, the, country, week, tournaments, at, both, cricket, and, tennis, to, be, played, during, separate, weeks, bradman, s, boss, presented, him, with, an, ultimatum, he, could, have, only, one, week, away, from, work, and, therefore, had, to, choose, between, the, two, sports, he, chose, cricket, bradman, s, performances, during, country, week, resulted, in, an, invitation, to, play, grade, cricket, in, sydney, for, st, george, in, the, 1926, 27, season, he, scored, 110, on, his, debut, making, his, first, century, on, a, turf, pitch, on, 1, january, 1927, bradman, turned, out, for, the, nsw, second, team, for, the, remainder, of, the, season, he, travelled, the, 130, kilometres, 81, mi, from, bowral, to, sydney, every, saturday, to, play, for, st, george, the, next, season, continued, the, rapid, rise, of, the, boy, from, bowral, selected, to, replace, the, unfit, archie, jackson, in, the, nsw, team, bradman, made, his, first, class, debut, at, the, adelaide, oval, aged, 19, he, secured, the, achievement, of, a, hundred, on, debut, with, an, innings, of, 118, featuring, what, soon, became, his, trademarks, fast, footwork, calm, confidence, and, rapid, scoring, in, the, final, match, of, the, season, he, made, his, first, century, at, the, scg, against, the, sheffield, shield, champions, victoria, despite, his, potential, bradman, was, not, chosen, for, the, australian, second, team, to, tour, new, zealand, bradman, decided, that, his, chances, for, test, selection, would, be, improved, by, moving, to, sydney, for, the, 1928, 29, season, when, england, were, to, tour, in, defence, of, the, ashes, initially, he, continued, working, in, real, estate, but, later, took, a, promotions, job, with, the, sporting, goods, retailer, mick, simmons, ltd, in, the, first, match, of, the, sheffield, shield, season, he, scored, a, century, in, each, innings, against, queensland, he, followed, this, with, scores, of, 87, and, 132, not, out, against, the, england, touring, team, and, was, rewarded, with, selection, for, the, first, test, to, be, played, at, brisbane, playing, in, only, his, tenth, first, class, match, bradman, nicknamed, braddles, by, his, teammates, found, his, initial, test, a, harsh, learning, experience, caught, on, a, sticky, wicket, australia, were, all, out, for, 66, in, the, second, innings, and, lost, by, 675, runs, still, a, test, record, following, scores, of, 18, and, 1, the, selectors, dropped, bradman, to, twelfth, man, for, the, second, test, an, injury, to, bill, ponsford, early, in, the, match, required, bradman, to, field, as, substitute, while, england, amassed, 636, following, their, 863, runs, in, the, first, test, rs, dick, whitington, wrote, he, had, scored, only, nineteen, himself, and, these, experiences, appear, to, have, provided, him, with, food, for, thought, recalled, for, the, third, test, at, the, melbourne, cricket, ground, bradman, scored, 79, and, 112, to, become, the, youngest, player, to, make, a, test, century, although, the, match, was, still, lost, another, loss, followed, in, the, fourth, test, bradman, reached, 58, in, the, second, innings, and, appeared, set, to, guide, the, team, to, victory, when, he, was, run, out, it, was, to, be, the, only, run, out, of, his, test, career, the, losing, margin, was, just, twelve, runs, the, improving, australians, did, manage, to, win, the, fifth, and, final, test, bradman, top, scored, with, 123, in, the, first, innings, and, was, at, the, wicket, in, the, second, innings, when, his, captain, jack, ryder, hit, the, winning, runs, bradman, completed, the, season, with, 1, 690, first, class, runs, averaging, 93, 88, and, his, first, multiple, century, in, a, sheffield, shield, match, not, out, against, victoria, set, a, new, ground, record, for, the, scg, bradman, averaged, 113, 28, in, 1929, 30, in, a, trial, match, to, select, the, team, that, would, tour, england, he, was, last, man, out, in, the, first, innings, for, 124, as, his, team, followed, on, the, skipper, bill, woodfull, asked, bradman, to, keep, the, pads, on, and, open, the, second, innings, by, the, end, of, play, he, was, 205, not, out, on, his, way, to, 225, against, queensland, at, the, scg, bradman, set, a, then, world, record, for, first, class, cricket, by, scoring, 452, not, out, he, made, his, runs, in, only, 415, minutes, not, long, after, the, feat, he, recalled, on, 434, i, had, a, curious, intuition, i, seemed, to, sense, that, the, ball, would, be, a, short, pitched, one, on, the, leg, stump, and, i, could, almost, feel, myself, getting, ready, to, make, my, shot, before, the, ball, was, delivered, sure, enough, it, pitched, exactly, where, i, had, anticipated, and, hooking, it, to, the, square, leg, boundary, i, established, the, only, record, upon, which, i, had, set, my, heart, although, he, was, an, obvious, selection, to, tour, england, bradman, s, unorthodox, style, raised, doubts, that, he, could, succeed, on, the, slower, english, pitches, percy, fender, wrote, he, will, always, be, in, the, category, of, the, brilliant, if, unsound, ones, promise, there, is, in, bradman, in, plenty, though, watching, him, does, not, inspire, one, with, any, confidence, that, he, desires, to, take, the, only, course, which, will, lead, him, to, a, fulfilment, of, that, promise, he, makes, a, mistake, then, makes, it, again, and, again, he, does, not, correct, it, or, look, as, if, he, were, trying, to, do, so, he, seems, to, live, for, the, exuberance, of, the, moment, the, encomiums, were, not, confined, to, his, batting, gifts, nor, did, the, criticism, extend, to, his, character, australia, has, unearthed, a, champion, said, former, australian, test, great, clem, hill, self, taught, with, natural, ability, but, most, important, of, all, with, his, heart, in, the, right, place, selector, dick, jones, weighed, in, with, the, observation, that, it, was, good, to, watch, him, talking, to, an, old, player, listening, attentively, to, everything, that, is, said, and, then, replying, with, a, modest, thank, you, england, were, favourites, to, win, the, 1930, ashes, series, and, if, the, australians, were, to, exceed, expectations, their, young, batsmen, bradman, and, jackson, needed, to, prosper, with, his, elegant, batting, technique, jackson, appeared, the, brighter, prospect, of, the, pair, however, bradman, began, the, tour, with, 236, at, worcester, and, went, on, to, score, 1, 000, first, class, runs, by, the, end, of, may, the, fifth, player, and, first, australian, to, achieve, this, rare, feat, in, his, first, test, appearance, in, england, bradman, hit, 131, in, the, second, innings, but, england, won, the, match, his, batting, reached, a, new, level, in, the, second, test, at, lord, s, where, he, scored, 254, as, australia, won, and, levelled, the, series, later, in, life, bradman, rated, this, the, best, innings, of, his, career, as, practically, without, exception, every, ball, went, where, it, was, intended, to, go, wisden, noted, bradman, s, fast, footwork, and, how, he, hit, the, ball, all, round, the, wicket, with, power, and, accuracy, as, well, as, faultless, concentration, in, keeping, the, ball, on, the, ground, in, terms, of, runs, scored, this, performance, was, soon, surpassed, in, the, third, test, at, headingley, bradman, scored, a, century, before, lunch, on, 11, july, the, first, day, of, the, test, match, to, equal, the, performances, of, victor, trumper, and, charlie, macartney, in, the, afternoon, bradman, added, another, century, between, lunch, and, tea, before, finishing, the, day, on, 309, not, out, he, remains, the, only, test, player, to, pass, 300, in, one, day, s, play, his, eventual, score, of, 334, was, a, world, record, exceeding, the, previous, mark, of, 325, by, andy, sandham, bradman, dominated, the, australian, innings, the, second, highest, tally, was, 77, by, alan, kippax, businessman, arthur, whitelaw, later, presented, bradman, with, a, cheque, for, 1, 000, in, appreciation, of, his, achievement, the, match, ended, in, anti, climax, as, poor, weather, prevented, a, result, as, it, also, did, in, the, fourth, test, in, the, deciding, test, at, the, oval, england, made, 405, during, an, innings, stretching, over, three, days, due, to, intermittent, rain, bradman, made, yet, another, multiple, century, this, time, 232, which, helped, give, australia, a, big, lead, of, 290, runs, in, a, crucial, partnership, with, jackson, bradman, battled, through, a, difficult, session, when, england, fast, bowler, harold, larwood, bowled, short, on, a, pitch, enlivened, by, the, rain, wisden, gave, this, period, of, play, only, a, passing, mention, on, the, wednesday, morning, the, ball, flew, about, a, good, deal, both, batsmen, frequently, being, hit, on, the, body, on, more, than, one, occasion, each, player, cocked, the, ball, up, dangerously, but, always, as, it, happened, just, wide, of, the, fieldsmen, a, number, of, english, players, and, commentators, noted, bradman, s, discomfort, in, playing, the, short, rising, delivery, the, revelation, came, too, late, for, this, particular, match, but, was, to, have, immense, significance, in, the, next, ashes, series, australia, won, the, match, by, an, innings, and, regained, the, ashes, the, victory, made, an, impact, in, australia, with, the, economy, sliding, toward, depression, and, unemployment, rapidly, rising, the, country, found, solace, in, sporting, triumph, the, story, of, a, self, taught, 22, year, old, from, the, bush, who, set, a, series, of, records, against, the, old, rival, made, bradman, a, national, hero, the, statistics, he, achieved, on, the, tour, especially, in, the, test, matches, broke, records, for, the, day, and, some, have, stood, the, test, of, time, in, all, bradman, scored, 974, runs, at, an, average, of, 139, 14, during, the, test, series, with, four, centuries, including, two, double, hundreds, and, a, triple, as, of, 2022, no, one, has, matched, or, exceeded, 974, runs, or, three, double, centuries, in, one, test, series, the, record, of, 974, runs, exceeds, the, second, best, performance, by, 69, runs, and, was, achieved, in, two, fewer, innings, bradman, s, first, class, tally, 2, 960, runs, at, an, average, of, 98, 66, with, 10, centuries, was, another, enduring, record, the, most, by, any, overseas, batsman, on, a, tour, of, england, on, the, tour, the, dynamic, nature, of, bradman, s, batting, contrasted, sharply, with, his, quiet, solitary, off, field, demeanour, he, was, described, as, aloof, from, his, teammates, and, he, did, not, offer, to, buy, them, a, round, of, drinks, let, alone, share, the, money, given, to, him, by, whitelaw, he, spent, a, lot, of, his, free, time, alone, writing, as, he, had, sold, the, rights, to, a, book, on, his, return, to, australia, bradman, was, surprised, by, the, intensity, of, his, reception, he, became, a, reluctant, hero, mick, simmons, wanted, to, cash, in, on, their, employee, s, newly, won, fame, asking, bradman, to, leave, his, teammates, and, attend, official, receptions, they, organised, in, adelaide, melbourne, goulburn, his, hometown, of, bowral, and, sydney, where, he, received, a, brand, new, custom, built, chevrolet, at, each, stop, bradman, received, a, level, of, adulation, that, embarrassed, him, this, focus, on, individual, accomplishment, in, a, team, game, permanently, damaged, relationships, with, his, contemporaries, commenting, on, australia, s, victory, the, team, s, vice, captain, vic, richardson, said, we, could, have, played, any, team, without, bradman, but, we, could, not, have, played, the, blind, school, without, clarrie, grimmett, a, modest, bradman, can, be, heard, in, a, 1930, recording, saying, i, have, always, endeavoured, to, do, my, best, for, the, side, and, the, few, centuries, that, have, come, my, way, have, been, achieved, in, the, hope, of, winning, matches, my, one, idea, when, going, into, bat, was, to, make, runs, for, australia, in, 1930, 31, against, the, first, west, indian, side, to, visit, australia, bradman, s, scoring, was, more, sedate, than, in, england, although, he, did, make, 223, in, 297, minutes, in, the, third, test, at, brisbane, and, 152, in, 154, minutes, in, the, following, test, at, melbourne, however, he, scored, quickly, in, a, very, successful, sequence, of, innings, against, south, africa, in, the, australian, summer, of, 1931, 32, for, nsw, against, the, tourists, he, made, 30, 135, and, 219, in, the, test, matches, he, scored, 226, 277, minutes, 112, 155, minutes, 2, and, 167, 183, minutes, his, 299, not, out, in, the, fourth, test, at, adelaide, set, a, new, record, for, the, highest, score, in, a, test, in, australia, australia, won, nine, of, the, ten, tests, played, over, the, two, series, at, this, point, bradman, had, played, fifteen, test, matches, since, the, beginning, of, 1930, scoring, 2, 227, runs, at, an, average, of, 131, he, had, played, eighteen, innings, scoring, ten, centuries, six, of, which, had, extended, beyond, 200, his, overall, scoring, rate, was, 42, runs, per, hour, with, 856, or, 38, 5, of, his, tally, scored, in, boundaries, significantly, he, had, not, hit, a, six, which, typified, bradman, s, attitude, if, he, hit, the, ball, along, the, ground, then, it, could, not, be, caught, during, this, phase, of, his, career, his, youth, and, natural, fitness, allowed, him, to, adopt, a, machine, like, approach, to, batting, the, south, african, fast, bowler, sandy, bell, described, bowling, to, him, as, heart, breaking, with, his, sort, of, cynical, grin, which, rather, reminds, one, of, the, sphinx, he, never, seems, to, perspire, between, these, two, seasons, bradman, seriously, contemplated, playing, professional, cricket, in, england, with, the, lancashire, league, club, accrington, a, move, that, according, to, the, rules, of, the, day, would, have, ended, his, test, career, a, consortium, of, three, sydney, businesses, offered, an, alternative, they, devised, a, two, year, contract, whereby, bradman, wrote, for, associated, newspapers, broadcast, on, radio, 2ue, and, promoted, the, menswear, retailing, chain, fj, palmer, and, son, however, the, contract, increased, bradman, s, dependence, on, his, public, profile, making, it, more, difficult, to, maintain, the, privacy, that, he, ardently, desired, in, a, second, class, fixture, in, november, 1931, bradman, scored, 100, off, 22, balls, in, a, three, over, spell, in, a, match, for, blackheath, against, lithgow, bradman, s, score, of, 256, included, 14, sixes, and, 29, fours, notably, hitting, more, sixes, in, this, one, innings, than, he, hit, in, his, entire, first, class, career, bradman, s, chaotic, wedding, to, jessie, menzies, in, april, 1932, epitomised, these, new, and, unwelcome, intrusions, into, his, private, life, the, church, was, under, siege, all, throughout, the, day, uninvited, guests, stood, on, chairs, and, pews, to, get, a, better, view, police, erected, barriers, that, were, broken, down, and, many, of, those, invited, could, not, get, a, seat, just, weeks, later, bradman, joined, a, private, team, organised, by, arthur, mailey, to, tour, the, united, states, and, canada, he, travelled, with, his, wife, and, the, couple, treated, the, trip, as, a, honeymoon, playing, 51, games, in, 75, days, bradman, scored, 3, 779, runs, at, 102, 1, with, eighteen, centuries, although, the, standard, of, play, was, not, high, the, effects, of, the, amount, of, cricket, bradman, had, played, in, the, three, previous, years, together, with, the, strains, of, his, celebrity, status, began, to, show, on, his, return, home, as, long, as, australia, has, bradman, she, will, be, invincible, it, is, almost, time, to, request, a, legal, limit, on, the, number, of, runs, bradman, should, be, allowed, to, make, news, chronicle, london, within, the, marylebone, cricket, club, mcc, which, administered, english, cricket, at, the, time, few, voices, were, more, influential, than, plum, warner, s, who, when, considering, england, s, response, to, bradman, wrote, that, it, must, evolve, a, new, type, of, bowler, and, develop, fresh, ideas, and, strange, tactics, to, curb, his, almost, uncanny, skill, to, that, end, warner, orchestrated, the, appointment, of, douglas, jardine, as, england, captain, in, 1931, as, a, prelude, to, jardine, leading, the, 1932, 33, tour, to, australia, with, warner, as, team, manager, remembering, that, bradman, had, struggled, against, bouncers, during, his, 232, at, the, oval, in, 1930, jardine, decided, to, combine, traditional, leg, theory, with, short, pitched, bowling, to, combat, bradman, he, settled, on, the, nottinghamshire, fast, bowlers, harold, larwood, and, bill, voce, as, the, spearheads, for, his, tactics, in, support, the, england, selectors, chose, another, three, pacemen, for, the, squad, the, unusually, high, number, of, fast, bowlers, caused, a, lot, of, comment, in, both, countries, and, roused, bradman, s, own, suspicions, bradman, had, other, problems, to, deal, with, at, this, time, among, these, were, bouts, of, illness, from, an, undiagnosed, malaise, which, had, begun, during, the, tour, of, north, america, and, that, the, australian, board, of, control, had, initially, refused, permission, for, him, to, write, a, column, for, the, sydney, sun, newspaper, bradman, who, had, signed, a, two, year, contract, with, the, sun, threatened, to, withdraw, from, cricket, to, honour, his, contract, when, the, board, denied, him, permission, to, write, eventually, the, paper, released, bradman, from, the, contract, in, a, victory, for, the, board, in, three, first, class, games, against, england, before, the, tests, bradman, averaged, just, 17, 16, in, six, innings, jardine, decided, to, give, the, new, tactics, a, trial, in, only, one, game, a, fixture, against, an, australian, xi, at, melbourne, in, this, match, bradman, faced, the, leg, theory, and, later, warned, local, administrators, that, trouble, was, brewing, if, it, continued, he, withdrew, from, the, first, test, at, the, scg, amid, rumours, that, he, had, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, despite, his, absence, england, employed, what, were, already, becoming, known, as, the, bodyline, tactics, against, the, australian, batsmen, and, won, an, ill, tempered, match, the, public, clamoured, for, the, return, of, bradman, to, defeat, bodyline, he, was, the, batsman, who, could, conquer, this, cankerous, bowling, bradmania, amounting, almost, to, religious, fervour, demanded, his, return, recovered, from, his, indisposition, bradman, returned, to, the, side, in, kippax, s, position, a, world, record, crowd, of, 63, 993, at, the, mcg, saw, bradman, come, to, the, crease, on, the, first, day, of, the, second, test, with, the, score, at, 2, 67, a, standing, ovation, ensued, that, delayed, play, for, several, minutes, bradman, anticipated, receiving, a, bouncer, as, his, first, ball, and, as, the, bowler, delivered, he, moved, across, his, stumps, to, play, the, hook, shot, the, ball, failed, to, rise, and, bradman, dragged, it, onto, his, stumps, the, first, ball, duck, was, his, first, in, a, test, the, crowd, fell, into, stunned, silence, as, he, walked, off, however, australia, took, a, first, innings, lead, in, the, match, and, another, record, crowd, on, 2, january, 1933, watched, bradman, hit, a, counter, attacking, second, innings, century, his, unbeaten, 103, from, 146, balls, in, a, team, total, of, 191, helped, set, england, a, target, of, 251, to, win, bill, o, reilly, and, bert, ironmonger, bowled, australia, to, a, series, levelling, victory, amid, hopes, that, bodyline, was, beaten, the, third, test, at, the, adelaide, oval, proved, pivotal, there, were, angry, crowd, scenes, after, the, australian, captain, bill, woodfull, and, wicket, keeper, bert, oldfield, were, hit, by, bouncers, an, apologetic, warner, entered, the, australian, dressing, room, and, was, rebuked, by, woodfull, woodfull, s, remarks, that, there, are, two, teams, out, there, and, only, one, of, them, is, playing, cricket, were, leaked, to, the, press, and, warner, and, others, attributed, this, to, australian, opening, batsman, jack, fingleton, however, for, many, years, even, after, fingleton, s, death, a, bitter, war, of, accusation, passed, between, fingleton, and, bradman, as, to, who, was, the, real, source, of, the, leak, in, a, cable, to, the, mcc, the, australian, board, of, control, repeated, the, allegation, of, poor, sportsmanship, directed, at, warner, by, woodfull, with, the, support, of, the, mcc, england, continued, with, bodyline, despite, australian, protests, the, tourists, won, the, last, three, tests, convincingly, and, regained, the, ashes, bradman, caused, controversy, with, his, own, tactics, always, seeking, to, score, and, with, the, leg, side, packed, with, fielders, he, often, backed, away, and, hit, the, ball, into, the, vacant, half, of, the, outfield, with, unorthodox, shots, reminiscent, of, tennis, or, golf, this, brought, him, 396, runs, at, 56, 57, for, the, series, and, plaudits, for, attempting, to, find, a, solution, to, bodyline, although, his, series, average, was, just, 57, of, his, career, mean, fingleton, was, in, no, doubt, that, bradman, s, game, altered, irrevocably, as, a, consequence, of, bodyline, writing, bodyline, was, specially, prepared, nurtured, for, and, expended, on, him, and, in, consequence, his, technique, underwent, a, change, quicker, than, might, have, been, the, case, with, the, passage, of, time, bodyline, plucked, something, vibrant, from, his, art, the, constant, glare, of, celebrity, and, the, tribulations, of, the, season, forced, bradman, to, reappraise, his, life, outside, the, game, and, to, seek, a, career, away, from, his, cricketing, fame, harry, hodgetts, a, south, australian, delegate, to, the, board, of, control, offered, bradman, work, as, a, stockbroker, if, he, would, relocate, to, adelaide, and, captain, the, south, australia, team, sa, unknown, to, the, public, the, sa, cricket, association, saca, instigated, hodgetts, approach, and, subsidised, bradman, s, wage, although, his, wife, was, hesitant, about, moving, bradman, eventually, agreed, to, the, deal, in, february, 1934, in, his, farewell, season, for, nsw, bradman, averaged, 132, 44, his, best, yet, he, was, appointed, vice, captain, for, the, 1934, tour, of, england, however, he, was, unwell, for, much, of, the, summer, and, reports, in, newspapers, hinted, that, he, was, suffering, from, heart, trouble, although, he, again, started, with, a, double, century, at, worcester, his, famed, concentration, soon, deserted, him, wisden, wrote, there, were, many, occasions, on, which, he, was, out, to, wild, strokes, indeed, at, one, period, he, created, the, impression, that, to, some, extent, he, had, lost, control, of, himself, and, went, in, to, bat, with, an, almost, complete, disregard, for, anything, in, the, shape, of, a, defensive, stroke, at, one, stage, bradman, went, thirteen, first, class, innings, without, a, century, the, longest, such, spell, of, his, career, prompting, suggestions, that, bodyline, had, eroded, his, confidence, and, altered, his, technique, after, three, tests, the, series, was, locked, up, 1, 1, and, bradman, had, scored, 133, runs, in, five, innings, the, australians, travelled, to, sheffield, and, played, a, warm, up, game, before, the, fourth, test, bradman, started, slowly, and, then, the, old, bradman, back, with, us, in, the, twinkling, of, an, eye, almost, he, went, on, to, make, 140, with, the, last, 90, runs, coming, in, just, 45, minutes, on, the, opening, day, of, the, fourth, test, at, headingley, leeds, england, were, out, for, 200, but, australia, slumped, to, 3, 39, losing, the, third, wicket, from, the, last, ball, of, the, day, listed, to, bat, at, number, five, bradman, would, start, his, innings, the, next, day, that, evening, bradman, declined, an, invitation, to, dinner, from, neville, cardus, telling, the, journalist, that, he, wanted, an, early, night, because, the, team, needed, him, to, make, a, double, century, the, next, day, cardus, pointed, out, that, his, previous, innings, on, the, ground, was, 334, and, the, law, of, averages, was, against, another, such, score, bradman, told, cardus, i, don, t, believe, in, the, law, of, averages, in, the, event, bradman, batted, all, of, the, second, day, and, into, the, third, putting, on, a, then, world, record, partnership, of, 388, with, bill, ponsford, when, he, was, finally, out, for, 304, 473, balls, 43, fours, and, two, sixes, australia, had, a, lead, of, 350, runs, but, rain, prevented, them, from, forcing, a, victory, the, effort, of, the, lengthy, innings, stretched, bradman, s, reserves, of, energy, and, he, did, not, play, again, until, the, fifth, test, at, the, oval, the, match, that, would, decide, the, ashes, in, the, first, innings, at, the, oval, bradman, and, ponsford, recorded, an, even, more, massive, partnership, this, time, 451, runs, it, had, taken, them, less, than, a, month, to, break, the, record, they, had, set, at, headingley, this, new, world, record, was, to, last, 57, years, bradman, s, share, of, the, stand, was, 244, from, 271, balls, and, the, australian, total, of, 701, set, up, victory, by, 562, runs, for, the, fourth, time, in, five, series, the, ashes, changed, hands, england, would, not, recover, them, again, until, after, bradman, s, retirement, seemingly, restored, to, full, health, bradman, blazed, two, centuries, in, the, last, two, games, of, the, tour, however, when, he, returned, to, london, to, prepare, for, the, trip, home, he, experienced, severe, abdominal, pain, it, took, a, doctor, more, than, 24, hours, to, diagnose, acute, appendicitis, and, a, surgeon, operated, immediately, bradman, lost, a, lot, of, blood, during, the, four, hour, procedure, and, peritonitis, set, in, penicillin, and, sulphonamides, were, still, experimental, treatments, at, this, time, peritonitis, was, usually, a, fatal, condition, on, 25, september, the, hospital, issued, a, statement, that, bradman, was, struggling, for, his, life, and, that, blood, donors, were, needed, urgently, the, effect, of, the, announcement, was, little, short, of, spectacular, the, hospital, could, not, deal, with, the, number, of, donors, and, closed, its, switchboard, in, the, face, of, the, avalanche, of, telephone, calls, generated, by, the, news, journalists, were, asked, by, their, editors, to, prepare, obituaries, o, reilly, took, a, call, from, king, george, v, s, secretary, asking, that, the, king, be, kept, informed, of, the, situation, bradman, s, wife, started, the, month, long, journey, to, london, as, soon, as, she, received, the, news, en, route, she, heard, a, rumour, that, her, husband, had, died, a, telephone, call, clarified, the, situation, and, by, the, time, she, reached, london, bradman, had, begun, a, slow, recovery, he, followed, medical, advice, to, convalesce, taking, several, months, to, return, to, australia, and, missing, the, 1934, 35, australian, season, there, was, off, field, intrigue, in, australian, cricket, during, the, antipodean, winter, of, 1935, australia, scheduled, to, make, a, tour, of, south, africa, at, the, end, of, the, year, needed, to, replace, the, retired, woodfull, as, captain, the, board, of, control, wanted, bradman, to, lead, the, team, yet, on, 8, august, the, board, announced, his, withdrawal, from, the, team, due, to, a, lack, of, fitness, surprisingly, in, the, light, of, this, announcement, bradman, led, the, south, australian, team, in, a, full, programme, of, matches, that, season, the, captaincy, was, given, to, vic, richardson, bradman, s, predecessor, as, south, australian, captain, cricket, author, chris, harte, s, analysis, of, the, situation, is, that, a, prior, unspecified, commercial, agreement, forced, bradman, to, remain, in, australia, harte, attributed, an, ulterior, motive, to, his, relocation, the, off, field, behaviour, of, richardson, and, other, south, australian, players, had, displeased, the, saca, which, was, looking, for, new, leadership, to, help, improve, discipline, bradman, became, a, committeeman, of, the, saca, and, a, selector, of, the, south, australian, and, australian, teams, he, took, his, adopted, state, to, its, first, sheffield, shield, title, for, ten, years, bradman, weighing, in, with, personal, contributions, of, 233, against, queensland, and, 357, against, victoria, he, finished, the, season, with, 369, in, 233, minutes, a, south, australian, record, made, against, tasmania, the, bowler, who, dismissed, him, reginald, townley, would, later, become, leader, of, the, tasmanian, liberal, party, australia, defeated, south, africa, 4, 0, and, senior, players, such, as, o, reilly, were, pointed, in, their, comments, about, the, enjoyment, of, playing, under, richardson, s, captaincy, a, group, of, players, who, were, openly, hostile, toward, bradman, formed, during, the, tour, for, some, the, prospect, of, playing, under, bradman, was, daunting, as, was, the, knowledge, that, he, would, additionally, be, sitting, in, judgement, of, their, abilities, in, his, role, as, a, selector, to, start, the, new, season, the, test, side, played, a, rest, of, australia, team, captained, by, bradman, at, sydney, in, early, october, 1936, the, test, xi, suffered, a, big, defeat, due, to, bradman, s, 212, and, a, haul, of, 12, wickets, taken, by, leg, spinner, frank, ward, bradman, let, the, members, of, the, test, team, know, that, despite, their, recent, success, the, team, still, required, improvement, shortly, afterwards, his, first, child, was, born, on, 28, october, but, died, the, next, day, he, took, time, out, of, cricket, for, two, weeks, and, on, his, return, made, 192, in, three, hours, against, victoria, in, the, last, match, before, the, beginning, of, the, ashes, series, the, test, selectors, made, five, changes, to, the, team, who, had, played, in, the, previous, test, match, significantly, australia, s, most, successful, bowler, clarrie, grimmett, was, replaced, by, ward, one, of, four, players, making, their, debut, bradman, s, role, in, grimmett, s, omission, from, the, team, was, controversial, and, it, became, a, theme, that, dogged, bradman, as, grimmett, continued, to, be, prolific, in, domestic, cricket, while, his, successors, were, ineffective, he, was, regarded, as, having, finished, the, veteran, bowler, s, test, career, in, a, political, purge, australia, fell, to, successive, defeats, in, the, opening, two, tests, bradman, making, two, ducks, in, his, four, innings, and, it, seemed, that, the, captaincy, was, affecting, his, form, the, selectors, made, another, four, changes, to, the, team, for, the, third, test, at, melbourne, bradman, won, the, toss, on, new, year, s, day, 1937, but, again, failed, with, the, bat, scoring, just, 13, the, australians, could, not, take, advantage, of, a, pitch, that, favoured, batting, and, finished, the, day, at, 6, 181, on, the, second, day, rain, dramatically, altered, the, course, of, the, game, with, the, sun, drying, the, pitch, in, those, days, covers, could, not, be, used, during, matches, bradman, declared, to, get, england, in, to, bat, while, the, pitch, was, sticky, england, also, declared, to, get, australia, back, in, conceding, a, lead, of, 124, bradman, countered, by, reversing, his, batting, order, to, protect, his, run, makers, while, conditions, improved, the, ploy, worked, and, bradman, went, in, at, number, seven, in, an, innings, spread, over, three, days, he, battled, influenza, while, scoring, 270, off, 375, balls, sharing, a, record, partnership, of, 346, with, jack, fingleton, and, australia, went, on, to, victory, in, 2001, wisden, rated, this, performance, as, the, best, test, match, innings, of, all, time, the, next, test, at, the, adelaide, oval, was, fairly, even, until, bradman, played, another, patient, second, innings, making, 212, from, 395, balls, australia, levelled, the, series, when, the, erratic, left, arm, spinner, chuck, fleetwood, smith, bowled, australia, to, victory, in, the, series, deciding, fifth, test, bradman, returned, to, a, more, aggressive, style, in, top, scoring, with, 169, off, 191, balls, in, australia, s, 604, and, australia, won, by, an, innings, australia, s, achievement, of, winning, a, test, series, after, outright, losses, in, the, first, two, matches, has, never, been, repeated, in, test, cricket, during, the, 1938, tour, of, england, bradman, played, the, most, consistent, cricket, of, his, career, he, needed, to, score, heavily, as, england, had, a, strengthened, batting, line, up, while, the, australian, bowling, was, over, reliant, on, o, reilly, grimmett, was, overlooked, but, jack, fingleton, made, the, team, so, the, clique, of, anti, bradman, players, remained, playing, 26, innings, on, tour, bradman, recorded, 13, centuries, a, new, australian, record, and, again, made, 1, 000, first, class, runs, before, the, end, of, may, becoming, the, only, player, to, do, so, twice, in, scoring, 2, 429, runs, bradman, achieved, the, highest, average, ever, recorded, in, an, english, season, 115, 66, in, the, first, test, england, amassed, a, big, first, innings, score, and, looked, likely, to, win, but, stan, mccabe, made, 232, for, australia, a, performance, bradman, rated, as, the, best, he, had, ever, seen, with, australia, forced, to, follow, on, bradman, fought, hard, to, ensure, mccabe, s, effort, was, not, in, vain, and, he, secured, the, draw, with, 144, not, out, it, was, the, slowest, test, hundred, of, his, career, and, he, played, a, similar, innings, of, 102, not, out, in, the, next, test, as, australia, struggled, to, another, draw, rain, completely, washed, out, the, third, test, at, old, trafford, australia, s, opportunity, came, at, headingley, a, test, described, by, bradman, as, the, best, he, ever, played, in, england, batted, first, and, made, 223, during, the, australian, innings, bradman, backed, himself, by, opting, to, bat, on, in, poor, light, conditions, reasoning, that, australia, could, score, more, runs, in, bad, light, on, a, good, pitch, than, on, a, rain, affected, pitch, in, good, light, when, he, had, the, option, to, go, off, he, scored, 103, out, of, a, total, of, 242, and, the, gamble, paid, off, as, it, meant, there, was, sufficient, time, to, push, for, victory, when, an, england, collapse, left, them, a, target, of, only, 107, to, win, australia, slumped, to, 4, 61, with, bradman, out, for, 16, an, approaching, storm, threatened, to, wash, the, game, out, but, the, poor, weather, held, off, and, australia, managed, to, secure, the, win, a, victory, that, retained, the, ashes, for, the, only, time, in, his, life, the, tension, of, the, occasion, got, to, bradman, and, he, could, not, watch, the, closing, stages, of, play, a, reflection, of, the, pressure, that, he, felt, all, tour, he, described, the, captaincy, as, exhausting, and, said, he, found, it, difficult, to, keep, going, the, euphoria, of, securing, the, ashes, preceded, australia, s, heaviest, defeat, at, the, oval, england, amassed, a, world, record, of, 7, 903, and, their, opening, batsman, len, hutton, scored, an, individual, world, record, by, making, 364, in, an, attempt, to, relieve, the, burden, on, his, bowlers, bradman, took, a, rare, turn, at, bowling, during, his, third, over, he, fractured, his, ankle, and, teammates, carried, him, from, the, ground, with, bradman, injured, and, fingleton, unable, to, bat, because, of, a, leg, muscle, strain, australia, were, thrashed, by, an, innings, and, 579, runs, which, remains, the, largest, margin, in, test, cricket, history, unfit, to, complete, the, tour, bradman, left, the, team, in, the, hands, of, vice, captain, stan, mccabe, at, this, point, bradman, felt, that, the, burden, of, captaincy, would, prevent, him, from, touring, england, again, although, he, did, not, make, his, doubts, public, despite, the, pressure, of, captaincy, bradman, s, batting, form, remained, supreme, an, experienced, mature, player, now, commonly, called, the, don, had, replaced, the, blitzing, style, of, his, early, days, as, the, boy, from, bowral, in, 1938, 39, he, led, south, australia, to, the, sheffield, shield, and, made, a, century, in, six, consecutive, innings, to, equal, cb, fry, s, world, record, bradman, totalled, 21, first, class, centuries, in, 34, innings, from, the, beginning, of, the, 1938, tour, of, england, including, preliminary, games, in, australia, until, early, 1939, the, next, season, bradman, made, an, abortive, bid, to, join, the, victoria, state, side, the, melbourne, cricket, club, advertised, the, position, of, club, secretary, and, he, was, led, to, believe, that, if, he, applied, he, would, get, the, job, the, position, which, had, been, held, by, hugh, trumble, until, his, death, in, august, 1938, was, one, of, the, most, prestigious, jobs, in, australian, cricket, the, annual, salary, of, 1, 000, would, make, bradman, financially, secure, while, allowing, him, to, retain, a, connection, with, the, game, on, 18, january, 1939, the, club, s, committee, on, the, casting, vote, of, the, chairman, chose, former, test, batsman, vernon, ransford, over, bradman, in, august, 1939, bradman, won, the, south, australian, squash, championships, beating, australian, davis, cup, tennis, player, don, turnbull, in, the, final, turnbull, won, the, first, two, games, in, the, best, of, five, game, contest, and, led, 8, 3, in, the, third, game, with, five, match, points, but, bradman, won, the, game, and, the, fourth, turnbull, led, 8, 5, in, the, fifth, game, but, bradman, went, on, to, win, the, 1939, 40, season, was, bradman, s, most, productive, ever, for, sa, 1, 448, runs, at, an, average, of, 144, 8, he, made, three, double, centuries, including, 251, not, out, against, nsw, the, innings, that, he, rated, the, best, he, ever, played, in, the, sheffield, shield, as, he, tamed, bill, o, reilly, at, the, height, of, his, form, however, it, was, the, end, of, an, era, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, led, to, the, indefinite, postponement, of, all, cricket, tours, and, the, suspension, of, the, sheffield, shield, competition, bradman, joined, the, royal, australian, air, force, raaf, on, 28, june, 1940, and, was, passed, fit, for, air, crew, duty, the, raaf, had, more, recruits, than, it, could, equip, and, train, and, bradman, spent, four, months, in, adelaide, before, the, governor, general, of, australia, lord, gowrie, persuaded, bradman, to, transfer, to, the, army, a, move, that, was, criticised, as, a, safer, option, for, him, given, the, rank, of, lieutenant, he, was, posted, to, the, army, school, of, physical, training, at, frankston, victoria, to, act, as, a, divisional, supervisor, of, physical, training, the, exertion, of, the, job, aggravated, his, chronic, muscular, problems, diagnosed, as, fibrositis, surprisingly, in, light, of, his, batting, prowess, a, routine, army, test, revealed, that, bradman, had, poor, eyesight, invalided, out, of, service, in, june, 1941, bradman, spent, months, recuperating, unable, even, to, shave, himself, or, comb, his, hair, due, to, the, extent, of, the, muscular, pain, he, suffered, he, resumed, stockbroking, during, 1942, in, his, biography, of, bradman, charles, williams, expounded, the, theory, that, the, physical, problems, were, psychosomatic, induced, by, stress, and, possibly, depression, bradman, read, the, book, s, manuscript, and, did, not, disagree, had, any, cricket, been, played, at, this, time, he, would, not, have, been, available, although, he, found, some, relief, in, 1945, when, referred, to, the, melbourne, masseur, ern, saunders, bradman, permanently, lost, the, feeling, in, the, thumb, and, index, finger, of, his, dominant, right, hand, in, june, 1945, bradman, faced, a, financial, crisis, when, the, firm, of, harry, hodgetts, collapsed, due, to, fraud, and, embezzlement, bradman, moved, quickly, to, set, up, his, own, business, utilising, hodgetts, client, list, and, his, old, office, in, grenfell, street, adelaide, the, fallout, led, to, a, prison, term, for, hodgetts, and, left, a, stigma,

winston, churchill, he, was, the, most, celebrated, man, in, england, during, the, summer, of, 1948, his, appearances, throughout, the, country, were, like, one, continuous, farewell, matin, e, at, last, his, batting, showed, human, fallibility, often, especially, at, the, start, of, the, innings, he, played, where, the, ball, wasn, t, and, spectators, rubbed, their, eyes, despite, his, waning,

three, cheers, from, the, opposition, his, test, batting, average, stood, at, 101, 39, facing, the, wrist, spin, of, eric, hollies, bradman, pushed, forward, to, the, second, ball, that, he, faced,

again, and, so, his, career, average, finished, at, 99, 94, if, he, had, scored, just, four, runs, in, his, last, innings, it, would, have, been, 100, a, story, developed, over, the, years, that, claimed, bradman, missed, the, ball, because, of, tears, in, his, eyes, a, claim, bradman, denied, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, australian, team, won, the, ashes, 4, 0, completed, the, tour, unbeaten, and, entered, history, as, the, invincibles, just, as, bradman, s, legend, grew, rather, than, diminished, over, the, years, so, too, has, the, reputation, of, the, 1948, team, for, bradman, it, was, the, most, personally, fulfilling, period, of, his, playing, days, as, the, divisiveness, of, the, 1930s, had, passed, he, wrote, knowing, the, personnel, i, was, confident, that, here, at, last, was, the, great, opportunity, which, i, had, longed, for, a, team, of, cricketers, whose, respect, and, loyalty, were, unquestioned, who, would, regard, me, in, a, fatherly, sense, and, listen, to, my, advice, follow, my, guidance, and, not, question, my, handling, of, affairs, there, are, no, longer, any, fears, that, they, will, query, the, wisdom, of, what, you, do, the, result, is, a, sense, of, freedom, to, give, full, reign, to, your, own, creative, ability, and, personal, judgment, with, bradman, now, retired, from, professional, cricket, rc, robertson, glasgow, wrote, of, the, english, reaction, a, miracle, has, been, removed, from, among, us, so, must, ancient, italy, have, felt, when, she, heard, of, the, death, of, hannibal, bradman, still, holds, the, following, significant, records, for, test, match, cricket, bradman, s, test, batting, average, of, 99, 94, has, become, one, of, cricket, s, most, famous, iconic, statistics, no, other, player, who, has, played, more, than, 20, test, match, innings, has, finished, their, career, with, a, test, average, of, more, than, 62, bradman, scored, centuries, at, a, rate, better, than, one, every, three, innings, in, 80, test, innings, bradman, scored, 29, centuries, only, 11, players, have, since, surpassed, his, total, all, at, a, much, slower, rate, the, next, fastest, player, to, reach, 29, centuries, sachin, tendulkar, required, nearly, twice, as, long, 148, innings, to, do, so, in, addition, bradman, s, total, of, 12, test, double, hundreds, constituting, 15, of, his, innings, remains, the, most, achieved, by, any, test, batsman, and, was, accumulated, faster, than, any, other, player, s, total, for, comparison, the, next, highest, totals, of, test, double, hundreds, are, kumar, sangakkara, s, 11, in, 223, innings, 4, 9, brian, lara, s, 9, in, 232, innings, 3, 9, and, wally, hammond, s, 7, in, 140, innings, 5, the, next, highest, rate, of, scoring, test, double, centuries, was, achieved, by, vinod, kambli, whose, 21, innings, included, 2, double, centuries, 9, 5, wisden, hailed, bradman, as, the, greatest, phenomenon, in, the, history, of, cricket, indeed, in, the, history, of, all, ball, games, statistician, charles, davis, analysed, the, statistics, for, several, prominent, sportsmen, by, comparing, the, number, of, standard, deviations, that, they, stand, above, the, mean, for, their, sport, the, top, performers, in, his, selected, sports, are, the, statistics, show, that, no, other, athlete, dominates, an, international, sport, to, the, extent, that, bradman, does, cricket, in, order, to, post, a, similarly, dominant, career, statistic, as, bradman, a, baseball, batter, would, need, a, career, batting, average, of, 392, while, a, basketball, player, would, need, to, score, an, average, of, 43, 0, points, per, game, over, their, career, the, respective, records, are, 366, and, 30, 1, when, bradman, died, time, allocated, a, space, in, its, milestones, column, for, an, obituary, australian, icon, considered, by, many, to, be, the, pre, eminent, sportsman, of, all, time, one, of, australia, s, most, beloved, heroes, he, was, revered, abroad, as, well, when, nelson, mandela, was, released, after, 27, years, in, prison, his, first, question, to, an, australian, visitor, was, is, sir, donald, bradman, still, alive, bradman, s, early, development, was, shaped, by, the, high, bounce, of, the, ball, on, matting, over, concrete, pitches, he, favoured, horizontal, bat, shots, such, as, the, hook, pull, and, cut, to, deal, with, the, bounce, and, devised, a, unique, grip, on, the, bat, handle, that, would, accommodate, these, strokes, without, compromising, his, ability, to, defend, employing, a, side, on, stance, at, the, wicket, bradman, kept, perfectly, still, as, the, bowler, ran, in, his, backswing, had, a, crooked, look, that, troubled, his, early, critics, but, he, resisted, entreaties, to, change, his, backswing, kept, his, hands, in, close, to, the, body, leaving, him, perfectly, balanced, and, able, to, change, his, stroke, mid, swing, if, need, be, another, telling, factor, was, the, decisiveness, of, bradman, s, footwork, he, used, the, crease, by, either, coming, metres, down, the, pitch, to, drive, or, playing, so, far, back, that, his, feet, ended, up, level, with, the, stumps, when, playing, the, cut, hook, or, pull, bradman, s, game, evolved, with, experience, he, temporarily, adapted, his, technique, during, the, bodyline, series, deliberately, moving, around, the, crease, in, an, attempt, to, score, from, the, short, pitched, deliveries, at, his, peak, in, the, mid, 1930s, he, had, the, ability, to, switch, between, a, defensive, and, attacking, approach, as, the, occasion, demanded, after, the, second, world, war, he, adjusted, to, bat, within, the, limitations, set, by, his, age, becoming, a, steady, accumulator, of, runs, however, bradman, never, truly, mastered, batting, on, sticky, wickets, wisden, commented, f, there, really, is, a, blemish, on, his, amazing, record, it, is, the, absence, of, a, significant, innings, on, one, of, those, sticky, dogs, of, old, after, his, return, to, australia, bradman, played, in, his, own, testimonial, match, at, melbourne, scoring, his, 117th, and, last, century, and, receiving, 9, 342, in, proceeds, a606, 489, in, 2021, terms, in, the, 1949, new, year, honours, he, was, appointed, knight, bachelor, for, his, services, to, the, game, becoming, the, only, australian, cricketer, ever, to, be, knighted, he, commented, that, he, would, have, preferred, to, remain, just, mister, the, following, year, he, published, a, memoir, farewell, to, cricket, bradman, accepted, offers, from, the, daily, mail, to, travel, with, and, write, about, the, 1953, and, 1956, australian, teams, in, england, the, art, of, cricket, his, final, book, published, in, 1958, is, an, instructional, manual, bradman, retired, from, his, stockbroking, business, in, june, 1954, depending, on, the, comfortable, income, earned, as, a, board, member, of, 16, publicly, listed, companies, his, highest, profile, affiliation, was, with, argo, investments, limited, where, he, was, chairman, for, a, number, of, years, charles, williams, commented, that, usiness, was, excluded, on, medical, grounds, the, only, sensible, alternative, was, a, career, in, the, administration, of, the, game, which, he, loved, and, to, which, he, had, given, most, of, his, active, life, bradman, was, honoured, at, a, number, of, cricket, grounds, notably, when, his, portrait, was, hung, in, the, long, room, at, lord, s, until, shane, warne, s, portrait, was, added, in, 2005, bradman, was, one, of, just, three, australians, to, be, honoured, in, this, way, bradman, inaugurated, a, bradman, stand, at, the, sydney, cricket, ground, in, january, 1974, the, adelaide, oval, also, opened, a, bradman, stand, in, 1990, which, housed, new, media, and, corporate, facilities, the, oval, s, bradman, stand, was, demolished, in, 2012, as, the, stadium, underwent, an, extensive, re, development, later, in, 1974, he, attended, a, lord, s, taverners, function, in, london, where, he, experienced, heart, problems, which, forced, him, to, limit, his, public, appearances, to, select, occasions, only, with, his, wife, bradman, returned, to, bowral, in, 1976, where, the, new, cricket, ground, was, named, in, his, honour, he, gave, the, keynote, speech, at, the, historic, centenary, test, at, melbourne, in, 1977, on, 16, june, 1979, the, australian, government, awarded, bradman, the, nation, s, second, highest, civilian, honour, at, that, time, companion, of, the, order, of, australia, ac, in, recognition, of, service, to, the, sport, of, cricket, and, cricket, administration, in, 1980, he, resigned, from, the, acb, to, lead, a, more, secluded, life, in, addition, to, acting, as, one, of, south, australia, s, delegates, to, the, board, of, control, from, 1945, to, 1980, bradman, was, a, committee, member, of, the, saca, between, 1935, and, 1986, it, is, estimated, that, he, attended, 1, 713, saca, meetings, during, this, half, century, of, service, aside, from, two, years, in, the, early, 1950s, he, filled, a, selector, s, berth, for, the, test, team, between, 1936, and, 1971, cricket, saw, an, increase, in, defensive, play, during, the, 1950s, as, a, selector, bradman, favoured, attacking, positive, cricketers, who, entertained, the, paying, public, he, formed, an, alliance, with, australian, captain, richie, benaud, seeking, more, attractive, play, with, some, success, he, served, two, high, profile, periods, as, chairman, of, the, board, of, control, in, 1960, 63, and, 1969, 72, during, the, first, he, dealt, with, the, growing, prevalence, of, illegal, bowling, actions, in, the, game, a, problem, that, he, adjudged, the, most, complex, i, have, known, in, cricket, because, it, is, not, a, matter, of, fact, but, of, opinion, the, major, controversy, of, his, second, stint, was, a, proposed, tour, of, australia, by, south, africa, in, 1971, 72, on, bradman, s, recommendation, the, series, was, cancelled, cricket, journalist, michael, coward, said, of, bradman, as, an, administrator, bradman, was, more, than, a, cricket, player, nonpareil, he, was, an, astute, and, progressive, administrator, an, expansive, thinker, philosopher, and, writer, on, the, game, indeed, in, some, respects, he, was, as, powerful, persuasive, and, influential, a, figure, off, the, ground, as, he, was, on, it, in, the, late, 1970s, bradman, played, an, important, role, during, the, world, series, cricket, schism, as, a, member, of, a, special, australian, cricket, board, committee, formed, to, handle, the, crisis, he, was, criticised, for, not, airing, an, opinion, but, he, dealt, with, world, series, cricket, far, more, pragmatically, than, other, administrators, richie, benaud, described, bradman, as, a, brilliant, administrator, and, businessman, warning, that, he, was, not, to, be, underestimated, as, australian, captain, ian, chappell, fought, with, bradman, over, the, issue, of, player, remuneration, in, the, early, 1970s, and, has, suggested, that, bradman, was, parsimonious, i, thought, to, myself, ian, did, you, just, ask, bradman, to, fill, your, wallet, with, money, bradman, s, harangue, confirmed, my, suspicions, that, the, players, were, going, to, have, a, hard, time, extracting, more, money, from, the, acb, despite, south, africa, s, apartheid, regime, excluding, black, players, from, participating, in, national, sports, many, countries, including, australia, retained, sporting, relations, with, the, regime, until, the, mid, 1970s, in, this, vein, the, south, african, national, cricket, team, was, meant, to, tour, australia, over, the, 1971, 72, australian, summer, public, polls, from, the, time, suggested, that, despite, a, group, of, very, active, protestors, around, 75, of, australians, wanted, the, tour, to, go, ahead, believing, that, australia, should, not, interfere, with, south, africa, s, domestic, politics, bradman, as, chair, of, the, australian, cricket, board, was, initially, sympathetic, to, this, majority, position, of, allowing, the, planned, tour, to, proceed, he, expressed, the, view, that, white, south, african, cricketers, many, of, whom, had, voiced, their, opposition, to, apartheid, and, had, tried, harder, than, our, protestors, to, do, something, about, it, should, not, be, punished, for, the, decisions, of, their, national, government, however, seeking, to, understand, the, situation, better, bradman, travelled, to, south, africa, in, june, 1971, while, there, bradman, met, with, then, south, african, prime, minister, john, vorster, their, exchange, was, documented, as, follows, sobers, a, west, indian, cricketer, was, regarded, as, perhaps, the, greatest, cricketing, all, rounder, of, all, time, and, was, reportedly, admired, by, bradman, who, had, helped, get, sobers, out, to, play, in, south, australia, the, previous, decade, when, bradman, returned, to, australia, later, in, the, year, and, in, the, absence, of, any, intervention, by, the, australian, government, to, prevent, the, tour, he, argued, to, the, other, members, of, the, australian, cricket, board, that, they, should, cancel, the, tour, on, behalf, of, the, board, bradman, made, a, one, line, statement, to, the, press, we, will, not, play, them, until, they, choose, a, team, on, a, non, racial, basis, at, the, time, many, disapproved, of, bradman, s, decision, to, cancel, to, the, tour, vorster, unsurprisingly, decried, the, decision, calling, it, one, by, anarchists, communists, and, fellow, travellers, even, australian, prime, minister, william, mcmahon, expressed, regret, at, the, decision, saying, it, had, been, wanted, by, a, great, many, australians, meanwhile, some, australian, newspapers, lamented, that, a, small, violent, group, of, trouble, makers, has, won, the, day, and, that, bradman, had, conced, defeat, without, a, ball, being, bowled, the, decision, was, however, praised, in, other, media, and, was, well, received, by, anti, apartheid, activists, in, south, africa, those, who, appreciated, bradman, s, decision, included, a, then, imprisoned, nelson, mandela, after, bradman, s, death, mandela, prasied, him, on, public, television, stating, that, he, was, a, hero, a, true, hero, although, bradman, became, unwell, and, died, before, the, two, could, meet, australian, prime, minister, malcolm, fraser, gifted, mandela, a, signed, bat, from, the, cricketer, which, read, to, nelson, mandela, in, recognition, of, a, great, unfinished, innings, after, his, wife, s, death, in, 1997, bradman, suffered, a, discernible, and, not, unexpected, wilting, of, spirit, the, next, year, on, his, 90th, birthday, he, hosted, a, meeting, with, his, two, favourite, modern, players, shane, warne, and, sachin, tendulkar, but, he, was, not, seen, in, his, familiar, place, at, the, adelaide, oval, again, in, an, oft, recited, anecdote, tendulkar, was, impressed, with, bradman, s, sharpness, and, sense, of, humour, at, this, historic, meeting, i, tendulkar, asked, him, a, question, what, would, you, have, averaged, in, today, s, cricket, he, thought, about, it, and, said, maybe, 70, the, natural, reaction, was, why, only, 70, and, not, 99, he, said, c, mon, that, s, not, bad, for, a, 90, year, old, man, hospitalised, with, pneumonia, in, december, 2000, he, returned, home, in, the, new, year, and, died, there, on, 25, february, 2001, aged, 92, a, memorial, service, to, mark, bradman, s, life, was, held, on, 25, march, 2001, at, st, peter, s, anglican, cathedral, adelaide, the, service, was, attended, by, a, host, of, former, and, current, test, cricketers, as, well, as, australia, s, then, prime, minister, john, howard, leader, of, the, opposition, kim, beazley, and, former, prime, minister, bob, hawke, eulogies, were, given, by, richie, benaud, and, governor, general, sir, william, deane, the, service, was, broadcast, live, on, abc, television, to, a, viewing, audience, of, 1, 45, million, a, private, service, for, family, and, friends, was, earlier, held, at, the, centennial, park, cemetery, in, the, suburb, of, pasadena, with, many, people, lining, both, greenhill, and, goodwood, roads, to, pay, their, respects, as, his, funeral, motorcade, passed, by, cricket, writer, david, frith, summed, up, the, paradox, of, the, continuing, fascination, with, bradman, as, the, years, passed, with, no, lessening, of, his, reclusiveness, so, his, public, stature, continued, to, grow, until, the, sense, of, reverence, and, unquestioning, worship, left, many, of, his, contemporaries, scratching, their, heads, in, wondering, admiration, although, modest, about, his, own, abilities, and, generous, in, his, praise, of, other, cricketers, bradman, was, fully, aware, of, the, talents, he, possessed, as, a, player, there, is, some, evidence, that, he, sought, to, influence, his, legacy, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, bradman, carefully, selected, the, people, to, whom, he, gave, interviews, assisting, michael, page, roland, perry, and, charles, williams, who, all, produced, biographical, works, about, him, bradman, also, agreed, to, an, extensive, interview, with, norman, may, for, abc, radio, broadcast, as, bradman, the, don, declares, in, eight, 55, minute, episodes, during, 1988, as, early, as, 1939, bradman, had, a, royal, navy, ship, named, after, him, built, as, a, fishing, trawler, in, 1936, hms, bradman, was, taken, over, by, the, admiralty, in, 1939, but, was, sunk, by, german, aircraft, the, following, year, in, the, 1963, edition, of, wisden, cricketers, almanack, bradman, was, selected, by, neville, cardus, as, one, of, the, six, giants, of, the, wisden, century, this, was, a, special, commemorative, selection, requested, by, wisden, for, its, 100th, edition, the, other, five, players, chosen, were, sydney, barnes, w, g, grace, jack, hobbs, tom, richardson, and, victor,
