were, purified, for, a, week, through, fasting, and, ritual, bathing, before, the, cooking, of, the, feast, could, begin, this, tasting, of, taiwanese, cuisine, of, the, prince, regent, should, be, understood, as, part, of, an, integration, ceremony, of, incorporating, the, colony, into, the, empire, which, can, be, seen, as, the, context, and, purpose, of, hirohito, s, taiwanese, visit, having, visited, several, sites, outside, of, taipei, hirohito, returned, to, the, capital, on, the, 24th, and, on, the, 25th, of, april, just, one, day, before, his, departure, he, visited, the, beitou,

be, shortened, to, his, majesty, in, writing, the, emperor, was, also, referred, to, formally, as, the, reigning, emperor, in, november, 1928, hirohito, s, accession, was, confirmed, in, ceremonies, sokui, which, are, conventionally, identified, as, enthronement, and, coronation, sh, wa, no, tairei, shiki, but, this, formal, event, would, have, been, more, accurately, described, as, a, public, confirmation, that, he, possessed, the, japanese, imperial, regalia, also, called, the, three, sacred, treasures, which, have, been, handed, down, through, the, centuries, however, his, enthronement, events, were, planned, and, staged, under, the, economic, conditions, of, a, recession, whereas, the, 55th, imperial, diet, unanimously, passed, 7, 360, 000, for, the, festivities, the, first, part, of, hirohito, s, reign, took, place, against, a, background, of, financial, crisis, and, increasing, military, power, within, the, government, through, both, legal, and, extralegal, means, the, imperial, japanese, army, and, imperial, japanese, navy, held, veto, power, over, the, formation, of, cabinets, since, 1900, between, 1921, and, 1944, there, were, 64, separate, incidents, of, political, violence, hirohito, narrowly, escaped, assassination, by, a, hand, grenade, thrown, by, a, korean, independence, activist, lee, bong, chang, in, tokyo, on, 9, january, 1932, in, the, sakuradamon, incident, another, notable, case, was, the, assassination, of, moderate, prime, minister, inukai, tsuyoshi, in, 1932, marking, the, end, of, civilian, control, of, the, military, the, february, 26, incident, an, attempted, military, coup, followed, in, february, 1936, it, was, carried, out, by, junior, army, officers, of, the, k, d, ha, faction, who, had, the, sympathy, of, many, high, ranking, officers, including, yasuhito, prince, chichibu, one, of, hirohito, s, brothers, this, revolt, was, occasioned, by, a, loss, of, political, support, by, the, militarist, faction, in, diet, elections, the, coup, resulted, in, the, murders, of, several, high, government, and, army, officials, when, chief, aide, de, camp, shigeru, honj, informed, him, of, the, revolt, hirohito, immediately, ordered, that, it, be, put, down, and, referred, to, the, officers, as, rebels, b, to, shortly, thereafter, he, ordered, army, minister, yoshiyuki, kawashima, to, suppress, the, rebellion, within, the, hour, he, asked, for, reports, from, honj, every, 30, minutes, the, next, day, when, told, by, honj, that, the, high, command, had, made, little, progress, in, quashing, the, rebels, the, emperor, told, him, i, myself, will, lead, the, konoe, division, and, subdue, them, the, rebellion, was, suppressed, following, his, orders, on, 29, february, beginning, from, the, mukden, incident, in, 1931, in, which, japan, staged, a, false, flag, operation, and, made, a, false, accusation, against, chinese, dissidents, as, a, pretext, to, invade, manchuria, japan, occupied, chinese, territories, and, established, puppet, governments, such, aggression, was, recommended, to, hirohito, by, his, chiefs, of, staff, and, prime, minister, fumimaro, konoe, and, hirohito, did, not, voice, objection, to, the, invasion, of, china, a, diary, by, chamberlain, kuraji, ogura, says, that, he, was, reluctant, to, start, war, against, china, in, 1937, because, they, had, underestimated, china, s, military, strength, and, japan, should, be, cautious, in, its, strategy, in, this, regard, ogura, writes, hirohito, said, that, once, you, start, a, war, it, cannot, easily, be, stopped, in, the, middle, what, s, important, is, when, to, end, the, war, and, one, should, be, cautious, in, starting, a, war, but, once, begun, it, should, be, carried, out, thoroughly, nonetheless, according, to, herbert, bix, hirohito, s, main, concern, seems, to, have, been, the, possibility, of, an, attack, by, the, soviet, union, given, his, questions, to, his, chief, of, staff, prince, kan, in, kotohito, and, army, minister, hajime, sugiyama, about, the, time, it, could, take, to, crush, chinese, resistance, and, how, could, they, prepare, for, the, eventuality, of, a, soviet, incursion, based, on, bix, s, findings, hirohito, was, displeased, by, prince, kan, in, s, evasive, responses, about, the, substance, of, such, contingency, plans, but, nevertheless, still, approved, the, decision, to, move, troops, to, north, china, according, to, akira, fujiwara, hirohito, endorsed, the, policy, of, qualifying, the, invasion, of, china, as, an, incident, instead, of, a, war, therefore, he, did, not, issue, any, notice, to, observe, international, law, in, this, conflict, unlike, what, his, predecessors, did, in, previous, conflicts, officially, recognized, by, japan, as, wars, and, the, deputy, minister, of, the, japanese, army, instructed, the, chief, of, staff, of, japanese, china, garrison, army, on, 5, august, not, to, use, the, term, prisoners, of, war, for, chinese, captives, this, instruction, led, to, the, removal, of, the, constraints, of, international, law, on, the, treatment, of, chinese, prisoners, the, works, of, yoshiaki, yoshimi, and, seiya, matsuno, show, that, hirohito, also, authorized, by, specific, orders, rinsanmei, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, against, the, chinese, later, in, his, life, hirohito, looked, back, on, his, decision, to, give, the, go, ahead, to, wage, a, defensive, war, against, china, and, opined, that, his, foremost, priority, was, not, to, wage, war, with, china, but, to, prepare, for, a, war, with, the, soviet, union, as, his, army, had, reassured, him, that, the, china, war, would, end, within, three, months, but, that, decision, of, his, had, haunted, him, since, he, forgot, that, the, japanese, forces, in, china, were, drastically, fewer, than, that, of, the, chinese, hence, the, shortsightedness, of, his, perspective, was, evident, on, december, 1, 1937, hirohito, had, given, formal, instruction, to, general, iwane, matsui, to, capture, and, occupy, the, enemy, capital, of, nanking, he, was, very, eager, to, fight, this, battle, since, he, and, his, council, firmly, believed, that, all, it, would, take, is, a, one, huge, blow, to, bring, forth, the, surrender, of, chiang, kai, shek, he, even, gave, an, imperial, rescript, to, iwane, when, he, returned, to, tokyo, a, year, later, despite, the, brutality, that, his, officers, had, inflicted, on, the, chinese, populace, in, nanking, thus, hirohito, had, seemingly, turned, a, blind, eye, to, and, condoned, these, monstrosities, during, the, invasion, of, wuhan, from, august, to, october, 1938, hirohito, authorized, the, use, of, toxic, gas, on, 375, separate, occasions, despite, the, resolution, adopted, by, the, league, of, nations, on, 14, may, condemning, japanese, use, of, toxic, gas, in, july, 1939, hirohito, quarrelled, with, his, brother, prince, chichibu, over, whether, to, support, the, anti, comintern, pact, and, reprimanded, the, army, minister, seishir, itagaki, but, after, the, success, of, the, wehrmacht, in, europe, hirohito, consented, to, the, alliance, on, 27, september, 1940, ostensibly, under, hirohito, s, leadership, japan, became, a, contracting, partner, of, the, tripartite, pact, with, germany, and, italy, forming, the, axis, powers, the, objectives, to, be, obtained, were, clearly, defined, a, free, hand, to, continue, with, the, conquest, of, china, and, southeast, asia, no, increase, in, us, or, british, military, forces, in, the, region, and, cooperation, by, the, west, in, the, acquisition, of, goods, needed, by, our, empire, on, 5, september, prime, minister, konoe, informally, submitted, a, draft, of, the, decision, to, hirohito, just, one, day, in, advance, of, the, imperial, conference, at, which, it, would, be, formally, implemented, on, this, evening, hirohito, had, a, meeting, with, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, army, sugiyama, chief, of, staff, of, the, navy, osami, nagano, and, prime, minister, konoe, hirohito, questioned, sugiyama, about, the, chances, of, success, of, an, open, war, with, the, occident, as, sugiyama, answered, positively, hirohito, scolded, him, at, the, time, of, the, china, incident, the, army, told, me, that, we, could, achieve, peace, immediately, after, dealing, them, one, blow, with, three, divisions, but, you, can, t, still, beat, chiang, kai, shek, even, today, sugiyama, you, were, army, minister, at, that, time, china, is, a, vast, area, with, many, ways, in, and, ways, out, and, we, met, unexpectedly, big, difficulties, you, say, the, interior, of, china, is, huge, isn, t, the, pacific, ocean, even, bigger, than, china, didn, t, i, caution, you, each, time, about, those, matters, sugiyama, are, you, lying, to, me, chief, of, naval, general, staff, admiral, nagano, a, former, navy, minister, and, vastly, experienced, later, told, a, trusted, colleague, i, have, never, seen, the, emperor, reprimand, us, in, such, a, manner, his, face, turning, red, and, raising, his, voice, nevertheless, all, speakers, at, the, imperial, conference, were, united, in, favor, of, war, rather, than, diplomacy, baron, yoshimichi, hara, president, of, the, imperial, council, and, hirohito, s, representative, then, questioned, them, closely, producing, replies, to, the, effect, that,

initiate, war, was, a, mistake, he, agreed, but, the, next, day, he, would, tell, me, you, were, worried, about, it, yesterday, but, you, do, not, have, to, worry, so, much, thus, gradually, he, began, to, lean, toward, war, and, the, next, time, i, met, him, he, leaned, even, more, toward, in, short, i, felt, the, emperor, was, telling, me, my, prime, minister, does, not, understand,

begin, while, a, member, of, the, imperial, house, was, prime, minister, the, imperial, house, would, have, to, carry, the, responsibility, and, he, was, opposed, to, this, instead, hirohito, chose, the, hard, line, general, hideki, t, j, who, was, known, for, his, devotion, to, the, imperial, institution, and, asked, him, to, make, a, policy, review, of, what, had, been, sanctioned, by, the,

advisors, in, the, period, leading, up, to, pearl, harbor, he, expanded, his, control, over, military, matters, and, participated, in, the, conference, of, military, councillors, which, was, considered, unusual, of, him, additionally, he, sought, additional, information, regarding, the, attack, plans, an, aide, reported, that, he, openly, showed, joy, upon, learning, of, the, success, of, the, surprise, attacks, on, 25, november, henry, l, stimson, united, states, secretary, of, war, noted, in, his, diary, that, he, had, discussed, with, us, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, severe, likelihood, that, japan, was, about, to, launch, a, surprise, attack, and, that, the, question, had, been, how, we, should, maneuver, them, into, the, position, of, firing, the, first, shot, without, allowing, too, much, danger, to, ourselves, on, the, following, day, 26, november, 1941, us, secretary, of, state, cordell, hull, presented, the, japanese, ambassador, with, the, hull, note,

the, invasion, of, malaya, with, the, nation, fully, committed, to, the, war, hirohito, took, a, keen, interest, in, military, progress, and, sought, to, boost, morale, according, to, akira, yamada, and, akira, fujiwara, hirohito, made, major, interventions, in, some, military, operations, for, example, he, pressed, sugiyama, four, times, on, 13, and, 21, january, and, 9, and, 26, february, to, increase, troop, strength, and, launch, an, attack, on, bataan, on, 9, february, 19, march, and, 29, may, hirohito, ordered, the, army, chief, of, staff, to, examine, the, possibilities, for, an, attack, on, chongqing, in, china, which, led, to, operation, gogo, while, some, authors, like, journalists, peter, jennings, and, todd, brewster, say, that, throughout, the, war, hirohito, was, outraged, at, japanese, war, crimes, and, the, political, dysfunction, of, many, societal, institutions, that, proclaimed, their, loyalty, to, him, and, sometimes, spoke, up, against, them, others, such, as, historians, herbert, p, bix, and, mark, felton, as, well, as, the, expert, on, china, s, international, relations, michael, tai, point, out, that, hirohito, personally, sanctioned, the, three, alls, policy, sank, sakusen, a, scorched, earth, strategy, implemented, in, china, from, 1942, to, 1945, and, which, was, both, directly, and, indirectly, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, more, than, 2, 7, million, chinese, civilians, as, the, tide, of, war, began, to, turn, against, japan, around, late, 1942, and, early, 1943, the, flow, of, information, to, the, palace, gradually, began, to, bear, less, and, less, relation, to, reality, while, others, suggest, that, hirohito, worked, closely, with, prime, minister, hideki, tojo, continued, to, be, well, and, accurately, briefed, by, the, military, and, knew, japan, s, military, position, precisely, right, up, to, the, point, of, surrender, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, general, affairs, section, of, the, prime, minister, s, office, shuichi, inada, remarked, to, t, j, s, private, secretary, sadao, akamatsu, there, has, never, been, a, cabinet, in, which, the, prime, minister, and, all, the, ministers, reported, so, often, to, the, throne, in, order, to, effect, the, essence, of, genuine, direct, imperial, rule, and, to, relieve, the, concerns, of, the, emperor, the, ministers, reported, to, the, throne, matters, within, the, scope, of, their, responsibilities, as, per, the, prime, minister, s, directives, in, times, of, intense, activities, typed, drafts, were, presented, to, the, emperor, with, corrections, in, red, first, draft, second, draft, final, draft, and, so, forth, came, as, deliberations, progressed, one, after, the, other, and, were, sanctioned, accordingly, by, the, emperor, in, the, first, six, months, of, war, all, the, major, engagements, had, been, victories, japanese, advances, were, stopped, in, the, summer, of, 1942, with, the, battle, of, midway, and, the, landing, of, the, american, forces, on, guadalcanal, and, tulagi, in, august, hirohito, played, an, increasingly, influential, role, in, the, war, in, eleven, major, episodes, he, was, deeply, involved, in, supervising, the, actual, conduct, of, war, operations, hirohito, pressured, the, high, command, to, order, an, early, attack, on, the, philippines, in, 1941, 42, including, the, fortified, bataan, peninsula, he, secured, the, deployment, of, army, air, power, in, the, guadalcanal, campaign, following, japan, s, withdrawal, from, guadalcanal, he, demanded, a, new, offensive, in, new, guinea, which, was, duly, carried, out, but, failed, badly, unhappy, with, the, navy, s, conduct, of, the, war, he, criticized, its, withdrawal, from, the, central, solomon, islands, and, demanded, naval, battles, against, the, americans, for, the, losses, they, had, inflicted, in, the, aleutians, the, battles, were, disasters, finally, it, was, at, his, insistence, that, plans, were, drafted, for, the, recapture, of, saipan, and, later, for, an, offensive, in, the, battle, of, okinawa, with, the, army, and, navy, bitterly, feuding, he, settled, disputes, over, the, allocation, of, resources, he, helped, plan, military, offenses, in, september, 1944, hirohito, declared, that, it, must, be, his, citizens, resolve, to, smash, the, evil, purposes, of, the, westerners, so, that, their, imperial, destiny, might, continue, but, all, along, it, is, just, a, mask, for, the, urgent, need, of, japan, to, scratch, a, victory, against, the, counter, offensive, campaign, of, the, allied, forces, on, october, 18, 1944, the, imperial, headquarters, had, resolved, that, the, japanese, must, make, a, stand, in, the, vicinity, of, leyte, to, prevent, the, americans, from, landing, in, the, philippines, this, view, was, widely, frowned, upon, and, disgruntled, the, policymakers, from, both, the, army, and, navy, sectors, hirohito, was, quoted, that, he, approved, of, such, since, if, they, won, in, that, campaign, they, would, be, finally, having, a, room, to, negotiate, with, the, americans, as, high, as, their, spirits, could, go, the, reality, check, for, the, japanese, would, also, come, into, play, since, the, forces, they, have, sent, in, leyte, was, practically, the, ones, that, would, efficiently, defend, the, island, of, luzon, hence, the, japanese, had, struck, a, huge, blow, in, their, own, military, planning, the, media, under, tight, government, control, repeatedly, portrayed, him, as, lifting, the, popular, morale, even, as, the, japanese, cities, came, under, heavy, air, attack, in, 1944, 45, and, food, and, housing, shortages, mounted, japanese, retreats, and, defeats, were, celebrated, by, the, media, as, successes, that, portended, certain, victory, only, gradually, did, it, become, apparent, to, the, japanese, people, that, the, situation, was, very, grim, due, to, growing, shortages, of, food, medicine, and, fuel, as, u, s, submarines, began, wiping, out, japanese, shipping, starting, in, mid, 1944, american, raids, on, the, major, cities, of, japan, made, a, mockery, of, the, unending, tales, of, victory, later, that, year, with, the, downfall, of, tojo, s, government, two, other, prime, ministers, were, appointed, to, continue, the, war, effort, kuniaki, koiso, and, kantar, suzuki, each, with, the, formal, approval, of, hirohito, both, were, unsuccessful, and, japan, was, nearing, disaster, in, early, 1945, in, the, wake, of, the, losses, in, the, battle, of, leyte, emperor, hirohito, began, a, series, of, individual, meetings, with, senior, government, officials, to, consider, the, progress, of, the, war, all, but, ex, prime, minister, fumimaro, konoe, advised, continuing, the, war, konoe, feared, a, communist, revolution, even, more, than, defeat, in, war, and, urged, a, negotiated, surrender, in, february, 1945, during, the, first, private, audience, with, hirohito, he, had, been, allowed, in, three, years, konoe, advised, hirohito, to, begin, negotiations, to, end, the, war, according, to, grand, chamberlain, hisanori, fujita, hirohito, still, looking, for, a, tennozan, a, great, victory, in, order, to, provide, a, stronger, bargaining, position, firmly, rejected, konoe, s, recommendation, with, each, passing, week, victory, became, less, likely, in, april, the, soviet, union, issued, notice, that, it, would, not, renew, its, neutrality, agreement, japan, s, ally, germany, surrendered, in, early, may, 1945, in, june, the, cabinet, reassessed, the, war, strategy, only, to, decide, more, firmly, than, ever, on, a, fight, to, the, last, man, this, strategy, was, officially, affirmed, at, a, brief, imperial, council, meeting, at, which, as, was, normal, hirohito, did, not, speak, the, following, day, lord, keeper, of, the, privy, seal, k, ichi, kido, prepared, a, draft, document, which, summarized, the, hopeless, military, situation, and, proposed, a, negotiated, settlement, extremists, in, japan, were, also, calling, for, a, death, before, dishonor, mass, suicide, modeled, on, the, 47, ronin, incident, by, mid, june, 1945, the, cabinet, had, agreed, to, approach, the, soviet, union, to, act, as, a, mediator, for, a, negotiated, surrender, but, not, before, japan, s, bargaining, position, had, been, improved, by, repulse, of, the, anticipated, allied, invasion, of, mainland, japan, on, 22, june, hirohito, met, with, his, ministers, saying, i, desire, that, concrete, plans, to, end, the, war, unhampered, by, existing, policy, be, speedily, studied, and, that, efforts, be, made, to, implement, them, the, attempt, to, negotiate, a, peace, via, the, soviet, union, came, to, nothing, there, was, always, the, threat, that, extremists, would, carry, out, a, coup, or, foment, other, violence, on, 26, july, 1945, the, allies, issued, the, potsdam, declaration, demanding, unconditional, surrender, the, japanese, government, council, the, big, six, considered, that, option, and, recommended, to, hirohito, that, it, be, accepted, only, if, one, to, four, conditions, were, agreed, upon, including, a, guarantee, of, hirohito, s, continued, position, in, japanese, society, hirohito, decided, not, to, surrender, that, changed, after, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, the, soviet, declaration, of, war, on, 9, august, emperor, hirohito, told, k, ichi, kido, the, soviet, union, has, declared, war, and, today, began, hostilities, against, us, on, 10, august, the, cabinet, drafted, an, imperial, rescript, ending, the, war, following, hirohito, s, indications, that, the, declaration, did, not, compromise, any, demand, which, prejudiced, his, prerogatives, as, a, sovereign, ruler, on, 12, august, 1945, hirohito, informed, the, imperial, family, of, his, decision, to, surrender, one, of, his, uncles, prince, yasuhiko, asaka, asked, whether, the, war, would, be, continued, if, the, kokutai, national, polity, could, not, be, preserved, hirohito, simply, replied, of, course, on, 14, august, hirohito, made, the, decision, to, surrender, unconditionally, and, the, suzuki, government, notified, the, allies, that, it, had, accepted, the, potsdam, declaration, on, 15, august, a, recording, of, hirohito, s, surrender, speech, was, broadcast, over, the, radio, the, first, time, hirohito, was, heard, on, the, radio, by, the, japanese, people, announcing, japan, s, acceptance, of, the, potsdam, declaration, during, the, historic, broadcast, hirohito, stated, moreover, the, enemy, has, begun, to, employ, a, new, and, most, cruel, bomb, the, power, of, which, to, do, damage, is, indeed, incalculable, taking, the, toll, of, many, innocent, lives, should, we, continue, to, fight, not, only, would, it, result, in, an, ultimate, collapse, and, obliteration, of, the, japanese, nation, but, also, it, would, lead, to, the, total, extinction, of, human, civilization, the, speech, also, noted, that, the, war, situation, has, developed, not, necessarily, to, japan, s, advantage, and, ordered, the, japanese, to, endure, the, unendurable, the, speech, using, formal, archaic, japanese, was, not, readily, understood, by, many, commoners, according, to, historian, richard, storry, in, a, history, of, modern, japan, hirohito, typically, used, a, form, of, language, familiar, only, to, the, well, educated, and, to, the, more, traditional, samurai, families, a, faction, of, the, army, opposed, to, the, surrender, attempted, a, coup, d, tat, on, the, evening, of, 14, august, prior, to, the, broadcast, they, seized, the, imperial, palace, the, ky, j, incident, but, the, physical, recording, of, hirohito, s, speech, was, hidden, and, preserved, overnight, the, coup, failed, and, the, speech, was, broadcast, the, next, morning, in, his, first, ever, press, conference, given, in, tokyo, in, 1975, when, he, was, asked, what, he, thought, of, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, hirohito, answered, it, s, very, regrettable, that, nuclear, bombs, were, dropped, and, i, feel, sorry, for, the, citizens, of, hiroshima, but, it, couldn, t, be, helped, because, that, happened, in, wartime, shikata, ga, nai, meaning, it, cannot, be, helped, after, the, japanese, surrender, in, august, 1945, there, was, a, large, amount, of, pressure, that, came, from, both, allied, countries, and, japanese, leftists, that, demanded, hirohito, step, down, and, be, indicted, as, a, war, criminal, australia, britain, and, 70, percent, of, the, american, public, wanted, hirohito, tried, as, a, class, a, war, criminal, general, douglas, macarthur, did, not, like, the, idea, as, he, thought, that, an, ostensibly, cooperating, emperor, would, help, establish, a, peaceful, allied, occupation, regime, in, japan, macarthur, saw, hirohito, as, a, symbol, of, the, continuity, and, cohesion, of, the, japanese, people, as, a, result, any, possible, evidence, that, would, incriminate, hirohito, and, his, family, were, excluded, from, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, macarthur, created, a, plan, that, separated, hirohito, from, the, militarists, retained, hirohito, as, a, constitutional, monarch, but, only, as, a, figurehead, and, used, hirohito, to, retain, control, over, japan, to, help, achieve, american, postwar, objectives, in, japan, as, hirohito, appointed, his, uncle, and, daughter, s, father, in, law, prince, naruhiko, higashikuni, as, the, prime, minister, to, replace, kantar, suzuki, who, resigned, due, to, responsibility, for, the, surrender, to, assist, the, american, occupation, there, were, attempts, by, numerous, leaders, to, have, him, put, on, trial, for, alleged, war, crimes, many, members, of, the, imperial, family, such, as, princes, chichibu, takamatsu, and, higashikuni, pressured, hirohito, to, abdicate, so, that, one, of, the, princes, could, serve, as, regent, until, his, eldest, son, crown, prince, akihito, came, of, age, on, 27, february, 1946, hirohito, s, youngest, brother, prince, mikasa, even, stood, up, in, the, privy, council, and, indirectly, urged, hirohito, to, step, down, and, accept, responsibility, for, japan, s, defeat, according, to, minister, of, welfare, ashida, s, diary, everyone, seemed, to, ponder, mikasa, s, words, never, have, i, seen, his, majesty, s, face, so, pale, historians, have, criticized, the, decision, to, protect, hirohito, and, all, members, of, the, imperial, family, who, were, implicated, in, the, war, such, as, prince, chichibu, prince, asaka, prince, higashikuni, and, prince, fushimi, hiroyasu, from, criminal, prosecutions, before, the, war, crime, trials, actually, convened, the, supreme, commander, for, the, allied, powers, its, international, prosecution, section, ips, and, japanese, officials, worked, behind, the, scenes, not, only, to, prevent, the, imperial, family, from, being, indicted, but, also, to, influence, the, testimony, of, the, defendants, to, ensure, that, no, one, implicated, hirohito, high, officials, in, court, circles, and, the, japanese, government, collaborated, with, allied, general, headquarters, in, compiling, lists, of, prospective, war, criminals, while, the, individuals, arrested, as, class, a, suspects, and, incarcerated, solemnly, vowed, to, protect, their, sovereign, against, any, possible, taint, of, war, responsibility, thus, months, before, the, tokyo, tribunal, commenced, macarthur, s, highest, subordinates, were, working, to, attribute, ultimate, responsibility, for, pearl, harbor, to, hideki, t, j, by, allowing, the, major, criminal, suspects, to, coordinate, their, stories, so, that, hirohito, would, be, spared, from, indictment, according, to, john, w, dower, this, successful, campaign, to, absolve, hirohito, of, war, responsibility, knew, no, bounds, hirohito, was, not, merely, presented, as, being, innocent, of, any, formal, acts, that, might, make, him, culpable, to, indictment, as, a, war, criminal, he, was, turned, into, an, almost, saintly, figure, who, did, not, even, bear, moral, responsibility, for, the, war, according, to, bix, macarthur, s, truly, extraordinary, measures, to, save, hirohito, from, trial, as, a, war, criminal, had, a, lasting, and, profoundly, distorting, impact, on, japanese, understanding, of, the, lost, war, historian, gary, j, bass, presented, evidence, supporting, hirohito, s, responsibility, in, the, war, noting, that, had, he, been, prosecuted, as, some, judges, and, others, advocated, a, compelling, case, could, have, been, constructed, against, him, however, the, americans, were, apprehensive, that, removing, the, emperor, from, power, and, subjecting, him, to, trial, could, trigger, widespread, chaos, and, collapse, of, japan, given, his, revered, status, among, the, japanese, populace, additionally, the, advent, of, the, cold, war, brought, about, harsh, political, circumstances, chiang, kai, shek, s, chinese, nationalists, were, losing, the, chinese, civil, war, to, mao, zedong, s, chinese, communist, party, prompting, the, truman, administration, to, consider, the, potential, loss, of, china, as, an, ally, and, strategic, partner, as, a, result, ensuring, japan, s, strength, and, stability, became, imperative, for, securing, a, reliable, postwar, ally, hirohito, was, not, put, on, trial, but, he, was, forced, to, explicitly, reject, the, quasi, official, claim, that, hirohito, of, japan, was, an, arahitogami, i, e, an, incarnate, divinity, this, was, motivated, by, the, fact, that, according, to, the, japanese, constitution, of, 1889, hirohito, had, a, divine, power, over, his, country, which, was, derived, from, the, shinto, belief, that, the, japanese, imperial, family, were, the, descendants, of, the, sun, goddess, amaterasu, hirohito, was, however, persistent, in, the, idea, that, the, emperor, of, japan, should, be, considered, a, descendant, of, the, gods, in, december, 1945, he, told, his, vice, grand, chamberlain, michio, kinoshita, it, is, permissible, to, say, that, the, idea, that, the, japanese, are, descendants, of, the, gods, is, a, false, conception, but, it, is, absolutely, impermissible, to, call, chimerical, the, idea, that, the, emperor, is, a, descendant, of, the, gods, in, any, case, the, renunciation, of, divinity, was, noted, more, by, foreigners, than, by, japanese, and, seems, to, have, been, intended, for, the, consumption, of, the, former, the, theory, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, had, already, had, some, proponents, in, japan, in, 1935, when, tatsukichi, minobe, advocated, the, theory, that, sovereignty, resides, in, the, state, of, which, the, emperor, is, just, an, organ, the, tenn, kikan, setsu, it, caused, a, furor, he, was, forced, to, resign, from, the, house, of, peers, and, his, post, at, the, tokyo, imperial, university, his, books, were, banned, and, an, attempt, was, made, on, his, life, not, until, 1946, was, the, tremendous, step, made, to, alter, the, emperor, s, title, from, imperial, sovereign, to, constitutional, monarch, although, the, emperor, had, supposedly, repudiated, claims, to, divinity, his, public, position, was, deliberately, left, vague, partly, because, general, macarthur, thought, him, probable, to, be, a, useful, partner, to, get, the, japanese, to, accept, the, occupation, and, partly, due, to, behind, the, scenes, maneuvering, by, shigeru, yoshida, to, thwart, attempts, to, cast, him, as, a, european, style, monarch, nevertheless, hirohito, s, status, as, a, limited, constitutional, monarch, was, formalized, with, the, enactment, of, the, 1947, constitution, officially, an, amendment, to, the, meiji, constitution, it, defined, the, emperor, as, the, symbol, of, the, state, and, the, unity, of, the, people, his, role, was, redefined, as, entirely, ceremonial, and, representative, without, even, nominal, governmental, powers, he, was, limited, to, performing, matters, of, state, as, delineated, in, the, constitution, and, in, most, cases, his, actions, in, that, realm, were, carried, out, in, accordance, with, the, binding, instructions, of, the, cabinet, following, the, iranian, revolution, and, the, end, of, the, short, lived, central, african, empire, both, in, 1979, hirohito, found, himself, the, last, monarch, in, the, world, to, bear, any, variation, of, the, highest, royal, title, emperor, for, the, rest, of, his, life, hirohito, was, an, active, figure, in, japanese, life, and, performed, many, of, the, duties, commonly, associated, with, a, constitutional, head, of, state, he, and, his, family, maintained, a, strong, public, presence, often, holding, public, walkabouts, and, making, public, appearances, at, special, events, and, ceremonies, for, example, in, 1947, the, emperor, made, a, public, visit, to, hiroshima, and, held, a, speech, in, front, of, a, massive, crowd, encouraging, the, city, s, citizens, he, also, played, an, important, role, in, rebuilding, japan, s, diplomatic, image, traveling, abroad, to, meet, with, many, foreign, leaders, including, queen, elizabeth, ii, of, the, united, kingdom, 1971, and, united, states, president, gerald, ford, 1975, he, was, not, only, the, first, reigning, japanese, emperor, to, visit, foreign, countries, but, also, the, first,

planned, at, the, outset, because, initially, the, stop, in, the, united, states, was, only, for, refueling, to, visit, europe, however, the, meeting, was, decided, in, a, hurry, at, the, request, of, the, united, states, although, the, japanese, side, accepted, the, request, minister, for, foreign, affairs, takeo, fukuda, made, a, public, telephone, call, to, the, japanese, ambassador, to, the,

foreign, minister, fukuda, was, worried, that, president, nixon, s, talks, with, hirohito, would, be, used, to, repair, the, deteriorating, japan, u, s, relations, and, he, was, concerned, that, the, premise, of, the, symbolic, emperor, system, could, fluctuate, there, was, an, early, visit, with, deep, royal, exchanges, in, denmark, and, belgium, and, in, france, they, were, warmly, welcomed, in,

hirohito, as, the, east, asian, equivalent, of, adolf, hitler, and, referred, to, him, as, hirohitler, and, prompted, a, wider, comparative, discussion, of, the, memory, and, perception, of, axis, war, crimes, the, protests, against, hirohito, s, visit, also, condemned, and, highlighted, what, they, perceived, as, mutual, japanese, and, west, german, complicity, in, and, enabling, of, the, american, war, effort, against, communism, in, vietnam, regarding, these, protests, and, opposition, emperor, hirohito, was, not, surprised, to, have, received, a, report, in, advance, at, a, press,

to, enshrine, the, war, criminals, in, 1978, nagayoshi, matsudaira, died, in, 2006, which, some, commentators, have, speculated, is, the, reason, for, release, of, the, memo, on, 22, september, 1987,

alongside, his, late, parents, emperor, taish, and, empress, teimei, and, his, wife, empress, nagako, who, died, in, 2000, the, issue, of, emperor, hirohito, s, war, responsibility, is, contested, during, the, war, the, allies, frequently, depicted, hirohito, to, equate, with, hitler, and, mussolini, as, the, three, axis, dictators, after, the, war, since, the, u, s, thought, that, the, retention, of, the, emperor, would, help, establish, a, peaceful, allied, occupation, regime, in, japan, and, help, the, u, s, achieve, their, postwar, objectives, they, depicted, hirohito, as, a, powerless, figurehead, without, any, implication, in, wartime, policies, historians, have, said, that, hirohito, wielded, more, power, than, previously, believed, and, he, was, actively, involved, in, the, decision, to, launch, the, war, as, well, as, in, other, political, and, military, decisions, over, the, years, as, new, evidence, surfaced, historians, were, able, to, arrive, at, the, conclusion, that, he, was, culpable, for, the, war, and, was, reflecting, on, his, wartime, role, historians, have, stated, that, hirohito, was, directly, responsible, for, the, atrocities, committed, by, the, imperial, forces, in, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, in, world, war, ii, they, have, said, that, he, and, some, members, of, the, imperial, family, such, as, his, brother, prince, chichibu, his, cousins, the, princes, takeda, and, fushimi, and, his, uncles, the, princes, kan, in, asaka, and, higashikuni, should, have, been, tried, for, war, crimes, in, a, study, published, in, 1996, historian, mitsuyoshi, himeta, said, that, the, three, alls, policy, sank, sakusen, a, japanese, scorched, earth, policy, adopted, in, china, and, sanctioned, by, emperor, hirohito, himself, was, both, directly, and, indirectly, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, more, than, 2, 7, million, chinese, civilians, his, works, and, those, of, akira, fujiwara, about, the, details, of, the, operation, were, commented, by, herbert, p, bix, in, his, hirohito, and, the, making, of, modern, japan, who, wrote, that, the, sank, sakusen, far, surpassed, nanking, massacre, not, only, in, terms, of, numbers, but, in, brutality, as, well, as, these, military, operations, caused, death, and, suffering, on, a, scale, incomparably, greater, than, the, totally, unplanned, orgy, of, killing, in, nanking, which, later, came, to, symbolize, the, war, while, the, nanking, massacre, was, unplanned, bix, said, hirohito, knew, of, and, approved, annihilation, campaigns, in, china, that, included, burning, villages, thought, to, harbor, guerrillas, top, u, s, government, officials, understood, the, emperor, s, intimate, role, during, the, war, deeply, engaged, in, military, operations, hirohito, commissioned, a, war, room, beneath, the, tokyo, imperial, palace, to, closely, monitor, japan, s, military, activities, the, extensive, resources, required, for, regular, updates, to, the, emperor, often, drew, complaints, from, military, officials, to, celebrate, significant, military, victories, he, rode, his, white, horse, in, parades, in, front, of, the, imperial, palace, poison, gas, weapons, such, as, phosgene, were, produced, by, unit, 731, and, authorized, by, specific, orders, given, by, hirohito, himself, transmitted, by, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, army, hirohito, authorized, the, use, of, toxic, gas, 375, times, during, the, battle, of, wuhan, from, august, to, october, 1938, he, rewarded, shiro, ishii, who, was, the, head, of, the, medical, experimentation, unit, and, unit, 731, with, a, special, service, medal, prince, mikasa, the, younger, brother, of, hirohito, informed, the, yomiuri, shimbun, that, during, 1944, he, compiled, a, thorough, report, detailing, the, wartime, atrocities, perpetrated, by, japanese, soldiers, in, china, he, clarified, that, he, didn, t, directly, discuss, the, report, with, hirohito, however, he, added, that, when, i, met, with, him, i, did, report, on, the, china, situation, in, bits, and, pieces, additionally, he, recalled, showing, hirohito, a, chinese, produced, film, depicting, japanese, atrocities, officially, the, imperial, constitution, adopted, under, emperor, meiji, gave, full, power, to, the, emperor, article, 4, prescribed, that, the, emperor, is, the, head, of, the, empire, combining, in, himself, the, rights, of, sovereignty, and, exercises, them, according, to, the, provisions, of, the, present, constitution, likewise, according, to, article, 6, the, emperor, gives, sanction, to, laws, and, orders, them, to, be, promulgated, and, executed, and, article, 11, the, emperor, has, the, supreme, command, of, the, army, and, the, navy, the, emperor, was, thus, the, leader, of, the, imperial, general, headquarters, according, to, bob, tadashi, wakabayashi, of, york, university, hirohito, s, authority, up, to, 1945, depended, on, three, elements, first, he, was, a, constitutional, monarch, subject, to, legal, restrictions, and, binding, conventions, as, he, has, so, often, stressed, second, he, was, supreme, commander, of, japanese, armed, forces, though, his, orders, were, often, ignored, and, sometimes, defied, third, he, wielded, absolute, moral, authority, in, japan, by, granting, imperial, honors, that, conveyed, incontestable, prestige, and, by, issuing, imperial, rescripts, that, had, coercive, power, greater, than, law, the, last, two, elements, of, hirohito, s, power, were, the, strongest, while, the, first, element, was, the, weakest, hirohito, had, the, ultimate, authority, to, shape, the, country, s, policies, by, either, agreeing, or, disagreeing, with, it, he, even, used, his, authority, to, disagree, with, policies, shaped, by, the, army, hirohito, was, the, supreme, military, commander, in, imperial, japan, and, pursued, armed, expansionist, policies, against, weaker, asian, neighbors, he, never, opposed, war, or, expansion, but, he, opposed, war, with, the, us, and, britain, because, of, his, fear, that, japan, would, lose, wakabayashi, further, adds, also, as, a, matter, of, course, he, wanted, to, keep, what, his, generals, conquered, though, he, was, less, greedy, than, some, of, them, none, of, this, should, surprise, us, hirohito, would, be, no, more, have, granted, independence, korea, independence, or, returned, manchuria, to, china, than, roosevelt, would, have, granted, hawaii, independence, or, returned, texas, to, mexico, historians, such, as, herbert, bix, akira, fujiwara, peter, wetzler, and, akira, yamada, assert, that, post, war, arguments, favoring, the, view, that, hirohito, was, a, mere, figurehead, overlook, the, importance, of, numerous, behind, the, chrysanthemum, curtain, meetings, where, the, real, decisions, were, made, between, the, emperor, his, chiefs, of, staff, and, the, cabinet, using, primary, sources, and, the, monumental, work, of, shir, hara, as, a, basis, fujiwara, and, wetzler, have, produced, evidence, suggesting, that, the, emperor, worked, through, intermediaries, to, exercise, a, great, deal, of, control, over, the, military, and, was, neither, bellicose, nor, a, pacifist, but, an, opportunist, who, governed, in, a, pluralistic, decision, making, process, american, historian, herbert, p, bix, said, that, emperor, hirohito, might, have, been, the, prime, mover, behind, most, of, japan, s, military, aggression, during, the, sh, wa, era, the, view, promoted, by, the, imperial, palace, and, american, occupation, forces, immediately, after, world, war, ii, portrayed, emperor, hirohito, as, a, purely, ceremonial, figure, who, behaved, strictly, according, to, protocol, while, remaining, at, a, distance, from, the, decision, making, processes, this, view, was, endorsed, by, prime, minister, noboru, takeshita, in, a, speech, on, the, day, of, hirohito, s, death, in, which, takeshita, asserted, that, the, war, had, broken, out, against, wishes, takeshita, s, statement, provoked, outrage, in, nations, in, east, asia, and, commonwealth, nations, such, as, the, united, kingdom, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, according, to, historian, fujiwara, the, thesis, that, the, emperor, as, an, organ, of, responsibility, could, not, reverse, cabinet, decision, is, a, myth, fabricated, after, the, war, according, to, yinan, he, associate, professor, of, international, relations, at, lehigh, university, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, conservative, japanese, elites, created, self, whitewashing, self, glorifying, national, myths, that, minimized, the, scope, of, japan, s, war, responsibility, which, included, presenting, the, emperor, as, a, peace, seeking, diplomat, and, a, narrative, that, separated, him, from, the, militarists, whom, they, described, as, people, who, hijacked, the, japanese, government, and, led, the, country, into, war, shifting, the, responsibility, from, the, ruling, class, to, only, a, few, military, leaders, this, narrative, also, narrowly, focuses, on, the, u, s, japan, conflict, completely, ignores, the, wars, japan, waged, in, asia, and, disregards, the, atrocities, committed, by, japanese, troops, during, the, war, japanese, elites, created, the, narrative, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, tarnishing, the, national, image, and, regain, the, international, acceptance, of, the, country, kentar, awaya, said, that, post, war, japanese, public, opinion, supporting, protection, of, the, emperor, was, influenced, by, u, s, propaganda, promoting, the, view, that, the, emperor, together, with, the, japanese, people, had, been, fooled, by, the, military, in, the, years, immediately, after, hirohito, s, death, scholars, who, spoke, out, against, the, emperor, were, threatened, and, attacked, by, right, wing, extremists, susan, chira, reported, scholars, who, have, spoken, out, against, the, late, emperor, have, received, threatening, phone, calls, from, japan, s, extremist, right, wing, one, example, of, actual, violence, occurred, in, 1990, when, the, mayor, of, nagasaki, hitoshi, motoshima, was, shot, and, critically, wounded, by, a, member, of, the, ultranationalist, group, seikijuku, a, year, before, in, 1989, motoshima, had, broken, what, was, characterized, as, one, of, most, sensitive, taboos, by, asserting, that, emperor, hirohito, bore, responsibility, for, world, war, ii, regarding, hirohito, s, exemption, from, trial, before, the, international, military, tribunal, of, the, far, east, opinions, were, not, unanimous, sir, william, webb, the, president, of, the, tribunal, declared, this, immunity, of, the, emperor, is, contrasted, with, the, part, he, played, in, launching, the, war, in, the, pacific, is, i, think, a, matter, which, the, tribunal, should, take, into, consideration, in, imposing, the, sentences, likewise, the, french, judge, henri, bernard, wrote, about, hirohito, s, accountability, that, the, declaration, of, war, by, japan, had, a, principal, author, who, escaped, all, prosecution, and, of, whom, in, any, case, the, present, defendants, could, only, be, considered, accomplices, an, account, from, the, vice, interior, minister, in, 1941, michio, yuzawa, asserts, that, hirohito, was, at, ease, with, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, once, he, had, made, a, decision, since, his, death, in, 1989, historians, have, discovered, evidence, that, prove, hirohito, s, culpability, for, the, war, and, that, he, was, not, a, passive, figurehead, manipulated, by, those, around, him, according, to, notebooks, by, michiji, tajima, a, top, imperial, household, agency, official, who, took, office, after, the, war, emperor, hirohito, privately, expressed, regret, about, the, atrocities, that, were, committed, by, japanese, troops, during, the, nanjing, massacre, in, addition, to, feeling, remorseful, about, his, own, role, in, the, war, he, fell, short, by, allowing, radical, elements, of, the, military, to, drive, the, conduct, of, the, war, in, december, 1990, the, bungeishunj, published, the, showa, tenno, dokuhaku, roku, dokuhaku, roku, which, recorded, conversations, hirohito, held, with, five, imperial, household, ministry, officials, between, march, and, april, 1946, containing, twenty, four, sections, the, dokuhaku, roku, recorded, hirohito, speaking, retroactively, on, topics, arranged, chronologically, from, 1919, to, 1946, right, before, the, tokyo, war, crimes, trials, japan, signed, the, tripartite, pact, in, 1940, and, another, agreement, in, december, 1941, that, forbade, japan, from, signing, a, separate, peace, treaty, with, the, united, states, in, the, dokuhaku, roku, hirohito, said, in, 1941, we, thought, we, could, achieve, a, draw, with, the, us, or, at, best, win, by, a, six, to, four, margin, but, total, victory, was, nearly, impossible, when, the, war, actually, began, however, we, gained, a, miraculous, victory, at, pearl, harbor, and, our, invasions, of, malaya, and, burma, succeeded, far, quicker, than, expected, so, if, not, for, this, agreement, we, might, have, achieved, peace, when, we, were, in, an, advantageous, position, the, passage, in, the, dokuhaku, roku, refutes, the, theory, that, hirohito, wanted, an, early, conclusion, to, the, war, due, to, his, value, for, peace, instead, it, provides, evidence, that, he, desired, its, end, because, of, japan, s, early, military, victories, in, pearl, harbor, and, southeast, asia, in, september, 1944, prime, minister, koiso, kuniaki, proposed, that, a, settlement, and, concessions, such, as, the, return, of, hong, kong, should, be, given, to, chiang, kai, shek, so, that, japanese, troops, in, china, could, be, diverted, to, the, pacific, war, hirohito, rejected, the, proposal, and, did, not, want, to, give, concessions, to, china, because, he, feared, it, would, signal, japanese, weakness, create, defeatism, at, home, and, trigger, independence, movements, in, occupied, countries, as, the, war, shifted, unfavorably, for, japan, his, sentiments, were, recorded, in, the, dokuhaku, roku, as, follows, i, hoped, to, give, the, enemy, one, good, bashing, somewhere, and, then, seize, a, chance, for, peace, yet, i, didn, t, want, to, ask, for, peace, before, germany, did, because, then, we, would, lose, trust, in, the, international, community, for, having, violated, that, corollary, agreement, as, the, war, front, progressed, northward, hirohito, persistently, hoped, for, the, japanese, military, to, deliver, a, good, bashing, at, some, point, during, the, war, which, meant, securing, a, decisive, victory, and, then, leveraging, that, success, to, negotiate, the, most, favorable, terms, possible, for, japan, in, the, autumn, of, 1944, he, hoped, for, a, victory, at, battle, of, leyte, gulf, but, japan, suffered, defeat, on, 14, february, 1945, fumimaro, konoe, wrote, a, proposal, to, hirohito, urging, him, to, quell, extremist, elements, within, the, military, and, end, the, war, konoe, argued, that, although, surrendering, to, america, might, preserve, imperial, rule, it, would, not, survive, a, communist, revolution, he, believed, was, imminent, hirohito, was, troubled, by, the, ambiguity, surrounding, america, s, commitment, to, upholding, imperial, rule, he, considered, the, advice, of, army, chief, of, staff, yoshijir, umezu, who, advocated, for, continuing, the, fight, to, the, bitter, end, believing, that, the, americans, could, be, lured, into, a, trap, on, taiwan, where, they, could, be, defeated, however, the, americans, avoided, taiwan, despite, the, defeat, at, the, battle, of, okinawa, and, acknowledging, japan, s, imminent, unconditional, surrender, following, this, defeat, hirohito, persisted, in, seeking, another, battlefield, where, a, decisive, victory, could, be, achieved, considering, locations, such, as, yunnan, or, burma, in, august, 1945, hirohito, agreed, to, the, potsdam, declaration, because,

it, from, yuzawa, s, family, the, bookseller, said, it, took, me, nine, years, to, come, forward, as, i, was, afraid, of, a, backlash, but, now, i, hope, the, memo, would, help, us, figure, out, what, really, happened, during, the, war, in, which, 3, 1, million, people, were, killed, takahisa, furukawa, expert, on, wartime, history, from, nihon, university, confirmed, the, authenticity, of, the,

made, a, decision, if, his, majesty, had, any, regret, over, negotiations, with, britain, and, the, u, s, he, would, have, looked, somewhat, grim, there, was, no, such, indication, which, must, be, a, result, of, his, determination, i, m, completely, relieved, given, the, current, conditions, i, could, say, we, have, practically, won, already, historian, furukawa, concluded, from, yuzawa, s, memo, tojo, is, a, bureaucrat, who, was, incapable, of, making, own, decisions, so, he, turned, to, the, emperor, as, his, supervisor, that, s, why, he, had, to, report, everything, for, the, emperor, to,

associate, professor, of, government, at, dartmouth, college, and, a, specialist, in, japanese, war, memory, said, over, the, years, these, different, pieces, of, evidence, have, trickled, out, and, historians, have, amassed, this, picture, of, culpability, and, how, he, was, reflecting, on, that, this, is, another, piece, of, the, puzzle, that, very, much, confirms, that, the, picture, that, was, taking, place, before, which, is, that, he, was, extremely, culpable, and, after, the, war, he, was, devastated, about, this, an, entry, dated, 27, may, 1980, said, the, emperor, wanted, to,

of, hirohito, s, ministers, and, advisers, as, being, worried, that, the, emperor, was, getting, ahead, of, them, in, terms, of, battle, preparations, thus, hyakutake, quotes, tsuneo, matsudaira, the, imperial, household, minister, saying, the, emperor, appears, to, have, been, prepared, for, war, in, the, face, of, the, tense, times, 13, october, 1941, likewise, koichi, kido, lord, keeper, of, the, privy, seal, is, quoted, as, saying, i, occasionally, have, to, try, to, stop, him, from, going, too, far, 13, october, 1941, the, emperor, s, resolve, appears, to, be, going, too, far, 20,

aides, expressed, concerns, about, hirohito, leaning, toward, japan, s, entry, into, the, war, hyakutake, s, diary, is, a, significant, record, penned, by, one, of, the, close, aides, to, the, emperor, documenting, the, process, of, how, japan, s, leaders, led, to, the, war, the, declassified, january, 1989, british, government, assessment, of, hirohito, describes, him, as, too, weak, to, alter, the, course, of, events, and, hirohito, was, powerless, and, comparisons, with, hitler, are, ridiculously, wide, off, the, mark, hirohito, s, power, was, limited, by, ministers, and, the, military, and, if, he, asserted, his, views, too, much, he, would, have, been, replaced, by, another, member, of, the, royal, family, indian, jurist, radhabinod, pal, opposed, the, international, military, tribunal, and, made, a, 1, 235, page, judgment, he, found, the, entire, prosecution, case, to, be, weak, regarding, the, conspiracy, to, commit, an, act, of, aggressive, war, with, brutalization, and, subjugation, of, conquered, nations, pal, said, there, is, no, evidence, testimonial, or, circumstantial, concomitant, prospectant, restrospectant, that, would, in, any, way, lead, to, the, inference, that, the, government, in, any, way, permitted, the, commission, of, such, offenses, he, added, that, conspiracy, to, wage, aggressive, war, was, not, illegal, in, 1937, or, at, any, point, since, pal, supported, the, acquittal, of, all, of, the, defendants, he, considered, the, japanese, military, operations, as, justified, because, chiang, kai, shek, supported, the, boycott, of, trade, operations, by, the, western, powers, particularly, the, united, states, boycott, of, oil, exports, to, japan, pal, argued, the, attacks, on, neighboring, territories, were, justified, to, protect, the, japanese, empire, from, an, aggressive, environment, especially, the, soviet, union, he, considered, that, to, be, self, defense, operations, which, are, not, criminal, pal, said, the, real, culprits, are, not, before, us, and, concluded, that, only, a, lost, war, is, an, international, crime, a, january, 1989, declassified, british, government, assessment, of, hirohito, said, the, emperor, was, uneasy, with, japan, s, drift, to, war, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, but, was, too, weak, to, alter, the, course, of, events, the, dispatch, by, john, whitehead, former, ambassador, of, the, united, kingdom, to, japan, to, foreign, secretary, geoffrey, howe, was, declassified, on, thursday, 20, july, 2017, at, the, national, archives, in, london, the, letter, was, written, shortly, after, hirohito, s, death, britain, s, ambassador, to, japan, john, whitehead, stated, in, 1989, by, personality, and, temperament, hirohito, was, ill, suited, to, the, role, assigned, to, him, by, destiny, the, successors, of, the, men, who, had, led, the, meiji, restoration, yearned, for, a, charismatic, warrior, king, instead, they, were, given, an, introspective, prince, who, grew, up, to, be, more, at, home, in, the, science, laboratory, than, on, the, military, parade, ground, but, in, his, early, years, every, effort, was, made, to, cast, him, in, a, different, mould, a, man, of, stronger, personality, than, hirohito, might, have, tried, more, strenuously, to, check, the, growing, influence, of, the, military, in, japanese, politics, and, the, drift, of, japan, toward, war, with, the, western, powers, the, contemporary, diary, evidence, suggests, that, hirohito, was, uncomfortable, with, the, direction, of, japanese, policy, the, consensus, of, those, who, have, studied, the, documents, of, the, period, is, that, hirohito, was, consistent, in, attempting, to, use, his, personal, influence, to, induce, caution, and, to, moderate, and, even, obstruct, the, growing, impetus, toward, war, whitehead, concludes, that, ultimately, hirohito, was, powerless, and, comparisons, with, hitler, are, ridiculously, wide, off, the, mark, if, hirohito, acted, too, insistently, with, his, views, he, could, have, been, isolated, or, replaced, with, a, more, pliant, member, of, the, royal, family, the, pre, war, meiji, constitution, defined, hirohito, as, sacred, and, all, powerful, but, according, to, whitehead, hirohito, s, power, was, limited, by, ministers, and, the, military, whitehead, explained, after, world, war, ii, that,
