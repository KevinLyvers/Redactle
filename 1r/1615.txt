andr, marie, amp, re, uk, p, r, m, p, r, us, m, p, r, french, 20, january, 1775, 10, june, 1836, was, a, french, physicist, and, mathematician, who, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, science, of, classical, electromagnetism, which, he, referred, to, as, electrodynamics, he, is, also, the, inventor, of, numerous, applications, such, as, the, solenoid, a, term, coined, by, him, and, the, electrical, telegraph, as, an, autodidact, amp, re, was, a, member, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, and, professor, at, the, cole, polytechnique, and, the, coll, ge, de, france, the, si, unit, of, measurement, of, electric, current, the, ampere, is, named, after, him, his, name, is, also, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, the, term, kinematic, is, the, english, version, of, his, cin, matique, which, he, constructed, from, the, greek, kinema, movement, motion, itself, derived, from, kinein, to, move, andr, marie, amp, re, was, born, on, 20, january, 1775, in, lyon, to, jean, jacques, amp, re, a, prosperous, businessman, and, jeanne, antoinette, desuti, res, sarcey, amp, re, during, the, height, of, the, french, enlightenment, he, spent, his, childhood, and, adolescence, at, the, family, property, at, poleymieux, au, mont, d, or, near, lyon, jean, jacques, amp, re, a, successful, merchant, was, an, admirer, of, the, philosophy, of, jean, jacques, rousseau, whose, theories, of, education, as, outlined, in, his, treatise, mile, were, the, basis, of, amp, re, s, education, rousseau, believed, that, young, boys, should, avoid, formal, schooling, and, pursue, instead, a, direct, education, from, nature, amp, re, s, father, actualized, this, ideal, by, allowing, his, son, to, educate, himself, within, the, walls, of, his, well, stocked, library, french, enlightenment, masterpieces, such, as, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, s, histoire, naturelle, g, n, rale, et, particuli, re, begun, in, 1749, and, denis, diderot, and, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, s, encyclop, die, volumes, added, between, 1751, and, 1772, thus, became, amp, re, s, schoolmasters, the, young, amp, re, however, soon, resumed, his, latin, lessons, which, enabled, him, to, master, the, works, of, leonhard, euler, and, daniel, bernoulli, in, addition, amp, re, used, his, access, to, the, latest, books, to, begin, teaching, himself, advanced, mathematics, at, age, 12, in, later, life, amp, re, claimed, that, he, knew, as, much, about, mathematics, and, science, when, he, was, eighteen, as, ever, he, knew, but, as, a, polymath, his, reading, embraced, history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and, the, natural, sciences, his, mother, was, a, devout, catholic, so, amp, re, was, also, initiated, into, the, catholic, faith, along, with, enlightenment, science, the, french, revolution, 1789, 99, that, began, during, his, youth, was, also, influential, amp, re, s, father, was, called, into, public, service, by, the, new, revolutionary, government, becoming, a, justice, of, the, peace, in, a, small, town, near, lyon, when, the, jacobin, faction, seized, control, of, the, revolutionary, government, in, 1792, his, father, jean, jacques, amp, re, resisted, the, new, political, tides, and, he, was, guillotined, on, 24, november, 1793, as, part, of, the, jacobin, purges, of, the, period, in, 1796, amp, re, met, julie, carron, and, in, 1799, they, were, married, amp, re, took, his, first, regular, job, in, 1799, as, a, mathematics, teacher, which, gave, him, the, financial, security, to, marry, carron, and, father, his, first, child, jean, jacques, named, after, his, father, the, next, year, jean, jacques, amp, re, eventually, achieved, his, own, fame, as, a, scholar, of, languages, amp, re, s, maturation, corresponded, with, the, transition, to, the, napoleonic, regime, in, france, and, the, young, father, and, teacher, found, new, opportunities, for, success, within, the, technocratic, structures, favoured, by, the, new, french, first, consul, in, 1802, amp, re, was, appointed, a, professor, of, physics, and, chemistry, at, the, cole, centrale, in, bourg, en, bresse, leaving, his, ailing, wife, and, infant, son, jean, jacques, antoine, amp, re, in, lyon, he, used, his, time, in, bourg, to, research, mathematics, producing, consid, rations, sur, la, th, orie, math, matique, du, jeu, 1802, considerations, on, the, mathematical, theory, of, games, a, treatise, on, mathematical, probability, that, he, sent, to, the, paris, academy, of, sciences, in, 1803, after, the, death, of, his, wife, in, july, 1803, amp, re, moved, to, paris, where, he, began, a, tutoring, post, at, the, new, cole, polytechnique, in, 1804, despite, his, lack, of, formal, qualifications, amp, re, was, appointed, a, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, school, in, 1809, as, well, as, holding, positions, at, this, school, until, 1828, in, 1819, and, 1820, amp, re, offered, courses, in, philosophy, and, astronomy, respectively, at, the, university, of, paris, and, in, 1824, he, was, elected, to, the, prestigious, chair, in, experimental, physics, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, 1814, amp, re, was, invited, to, join, the, class, of, mathematicians, in, the, new, institut, imp, rial, the, umbrella, under, which, the, reformed, state, academy, of, sciences, would, sit, amp, re, engaged, in, a, diverse, array, of, scientific, inquiries, during, the, years, leading, up, to, his, election, to, the, academy, writing, papers, and, engaging, in, topics, from, mathematics, and, philosophy, to, chemistry, and, astronomy, which, was, customary, among, the, leading, scientific, intellectuals, of, the, day, amp, re, claimed, that, at, eighteen, years, he, found, three, culminating, points, in, his, life, his, first, communion, the, reading, of, antoine, leonard, thomas, s, eulogy, of, descartes, and, the, taking, of, the, bastille, on, the, day, of, his, wife, s, death, he, wrote, two, verses, from, the, psalms, and, the, prayer, o, lord, god, of, mercy, unite, me, in, heaven, with, those, whom, you, have, permitted, me, to, love, on, earth, in, times, of, duress, he, would, take, refuge, in, the, reading, of, the, bible, and, the, fathers, of, the, church, a, lay, catholic, he, took, for, a, time, into, his, family, the, young, student, fr, d, ric, ozanam, 1813, 1853, one, of, the, founders, of, the, conference, of, charity, later, known, as, the, society, of, saint, vincent, de, paul, ozanam, would, much, later, be, beatified, by, pope, john, paul, ii, in, 1998, through, amp, re, ozanam, had, contact, with, leaders, of, the, neo, catholic, movement, such, as, fran, ois, ren, de, chateaubriand, jean, baptiste, henri, lacordaire, and, charles, forbes, ren, de, montalembert, in, september, 1820, amp, re, s, friend, and, eventual, eulogist, fran, ois, arago, showed, the, members, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, the, surprising, discovery, by, danish, physicist, hans, christian, rsted, that, a, magnetic, needle, is, deflected, by, an, adjacent, electric, current, amp, re, began, developing, a, mathematical, and, physical, theory, to, understand, the, relationship, between, electricity, and, magnetism, furthering, rsted, s, experimental, work, amp, re, showed, that, two, parallel, wires, carrying, electric, currents, attract, or, repel, each, other, depending, on, whether, the, currents, flow, in, the, same, or, opposite, directions, respectively, this, laid, the, foundation, of, electrodynamics, he, also, applied, mathematics, in, generalizing, physical, laws, from, these, experimental, results, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, principle, that, came, to, be, called, amp, re, s, law, which, states, that, the, mutual, action, of, two, lengths, of, current, carrying, wire, is, proportional, to, their, lengths, and, to, the, intensities, of, their, currents, amp, re, also, applied, this, same, principle, to, magnetism, showing, the, harmony, between, his, law, and, french, physicist, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, s, law, of, electric, action, amp, re, s, devotion, to, and, skill, with, experimental, techniques, anchored, his, science, within, the, emerging, fields, of, experimental, physics, amp, re, also, provided, a, physical, understanding, of, the, electromagnetic, relationship, theorizing, the, existence, of, an, electrodynamic, molecule, the, forerunner, of, the, idea, of, the, electron, that, served, as, the, component, element, of, both, electricity, and, magnetism, using, this, physical, explanation, of, electromagnetic, motion, amp, re, developed, a, physical, account, of, electromagnetic, phenomena, that, was, both, empirically, demonstrable, and, mathematically, predictive, almost, 100, years, later, in, 1915, albert, einstein, together, with, wander, johannes, de, haas, made, the, proof, of, the, correctness, of, amp, re, s, hypothesis, through, the, einstein, de, haas, effect, in, 1827, amp, re, published, his, magnum, opus, m, moire, sur, la, th, orie, math, matique, des, ph, nom, nes, lectrodynamiques, uniquement, d, duite, de, l, experience, memoir, on, the, mathematical, theory, of, electrodynamic, phenomena, uniquely, deduced, from, experience, the, work, that, coined, the, name, of, his, new, science, electrodynamics, and, became, known, ever, after, as, its, founding, treatise, in, 1827, amp, re, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, and, in, 1828, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, science, probably, the, highest, recognition, came, from, james, clerk, maxwell, who, in, his, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, named, amp, re, the, newton, of, electricity, an, international, convention, signed, at, the, 1881, international, exposition, of, electricity, established, the, ampere, as, one, of, the, standard, units, of, electrical, measurement, in, recognition, of, his, contribution, to, the, creation, of, modern, electrical, science, and, along, with, the, coulomb, volt, ohm, watt, and, farad, which, are, named, respectively, after, amp, re, s, contemporaries, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, of, france, alessandro, volta, of, italy, georg, ohm, of, germany, james, watt, of, scotland, and, michael, faraday, of, england, amp, re, s, name, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, many, streets, and, squares, are, named, after, amp, re, as, are, schools, a, lyon, metro, station, a, graphics, processing, unit, microarchitecture, a, mountain, on, the, moon, and, an, electric, ferry, in, norway, partial, translations, complete, translations
