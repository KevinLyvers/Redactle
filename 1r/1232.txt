1580, ten, years, after, the, siege, of, ishiyama, hongan, ji, began, the, son, of, chief, abbot, k, sa, surrendered, the, fortress, to, nobunaga, after, their, supplies, were, exhausted, and, they, received, an, official, request, from, the, emperor, to, do, so, nobunaga, spared, the, lives, of, ishiyama, hongan, ji, s, defenders, but, expelled, them, from, osaka, and, burnt, the, fortress, to, the, ground, although, the, ikk, ikki, continued, to, make, a, last, stand, in, kaga, province, nobunaga, s, capture, of, ishiyama, hongan, ji, crippled, them, as, a, major, military, force, one, of, the, strongest, rulers, in, the, anti, nobunaga, alliance, was, takeda, shingen, who, used, to, be, an, ally, of, the, oda, clan, at, the, apex, of, the, anti, nobunaga, coalition, in, 1572, takeda, shingen, ordered, akiyama, nobutomo, one, of, the, twenty, four, generals, of, shingen, to, attack, iwamura, castle, nobunaga, s, aunt, lady, otsuya, conspired, against, the, oda, clan, surrendered, the, castle, to, the, takeda, and, married, nobutomo, from, there, the, takeda, oda, relationship, declined, and, nobunaga, started, a, war, against, the, takeda, clan, in, the, same, year, shingen, decided, to, make, a, drive, for, kyoto, at, the, urgings, of, the, shogun, ashikaga, yoshiaki, starting, with, invading, tokugawa, territory, nobunaga, tied, down, on, the, western, front, sent, lackluster, aid, to, tokugawa, ieyasu, who, suffered, defeat, at, the, battle, of, mikatagahara, in, early, 1573, however, after, the, battle, tokugawa, s, forces, launched, night, raids, and, convinced, takeda, of, an, imminent, counter, attack, thus, saving, the, vulnerable, tokugawa, with, the, bluff, this, would, play, a, pivotal, role, in, tokugawa, s, philosophy, of, strategic, patience, in, his, campaigns, with, nobunaga, shortly, thereafter, the, takeda, forces, were, neutralized, after, shingen, died, in, april, 1573, 153, 56, in, 1575, takeda, katsuyori, son, of, takeda, shingen, moved, to, tokugawa, territory, attacked, yoshida, castle, and, later, besieged, nagashino, castle, katsuyori, angered, when, okudaira, sadamasa, rejoined, the, tokugawa, had, originally, conspired, with, oga, yashiro, to, take, the, tokugawa, controlled, okazaki, castle, the, capital, of, mikawa, province, this, plot, failed, 80, 82, tokugawa, ieyasu, appealed, to, nobunaga, for, help, and, nobunaga, personally, led, an, army, of, about, 30, 000, men, to, the, relief, of, nagashino, castle, the, combined, force, of, 38, 000, men, under, oda, nobunaga, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, defeated, and, devastated, the, takeda, clan, at, the, battle, of, nagashino, this, battle, was, the, greatest, defeat, of, the, takeda, clan, conventionally, the, battle, of, nagashino, was, regarded, as, a, historic, defeat, in, which, takeda, katsuyori, ordered, his, cavalry, to, charge, recklessly, into, a, horse, guard, fence, where, arquebusiers, were, waiting, for, them, losing, many, takeda, officers, and, soldiers, moreover, it, has, been, said, that, nobunaga, developed, a, new, battle, strategy, called, three, stage, shooting, in, which, arquebusiers, were, arranged, in, several, rows, with, the, front, row, firing, a, volley, and, then, making, way, for, the, second, row, to, fire, once, the, second, row, had, fired, and, made, way, for, the, third, row, the, first, row, had, reloaded, and, were, ready, to, fire, again, this, way, the, oda, could, keep, a, relatively, steady, rate, of, musket, fire, however, this, was, a, theory, developed, by, the, imperial, japanese, army, general, staff, based, on, oze, hoan, s, shinch, ki, and, t, yama, nobuharu, s, s, ken, ki, which, are, war, chronicles, later, as, research, based, on, documents, letters, and, ota, gy, ichi, s, shinch, k, ki, progressed, many, errors, were, pointed, out, it, is, now, believed, that, it, was, mainly, the, logistics, in, nobunaga, s, hands, that, determined, the, winner, the, end, of, the, takeda, clan, came, in, 1582, when, oda, nobutada, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, forces, conquered, shinano, and, kai, province, takeda, katsuyori, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, tenmokuzan, and, then, committed, suicide, in, early, 1573, yoshiaki, initiated, a, siege, against, nobunaga, under, the, directive, of, the, monk, kennyo, takeda, shingen, and, asakura, yoshikage, tried, to, subdue, yoshiaki, azai, nagamasa, matsunaga, hisahide, sanninshu, miyoshi, miyoshi, yoshitsugu, and, others, also, participated, in, the, siege, against, nobunaga, although, the, siege, initially, cornered, nobunaga, s, forces, but, the, siege, was, failed, it, was, interrupted, by, the, death, of, takeda, shingen, in, mid, 1573, yoshiaki, began, a, revolt, in, kyoto, he, requested, the, help, of, the, matsunaga, clan, and, allied, with, them, yoshiaki, and, the, matsunaga, clan, gathered, an, army, in, makishima, castle, in, april, and, again, in, july, which, is, when, the, revolt, started, this, angered, nobunaga, who, took, his, armies, and, invaded, kyoto, however, when, matsunaga, hisahide, saw, the, hope, for, success, was, not, achieved, he, returned, to, nobunaga, to, fight, the, miyoshi, nobunaga, s, entry, into, kyoto, presented, him, with, a, situation, very, different, from, that, from, which, he, had, come, nobunaga, reportedly, set, fire, to, kyoto, which, forced, yoshiaki, to, retreat, he, focused, on, ashikaga, yoshiaki, who, had, openly, declared, hostility, more, than, once, despite, the, imperial, court, s, intervention, nobunaga, was, able, to, defeat, yoshiaki, s, forces, and, the, power, of, the, ashikaga, was, effectively, destroyed, on, 27, august, 1573, when, nobunaga, drove, yoshiaki, out, of, kyoto, and, sent, him, into, exile, yoshiaki, became, a, buddhist, monk, shaving, his, head, and, taking, the, name, sho, san, which, he, later, changed, to, rei, o, in, bringing, the, ashikaga, shogunate, to, an, end, after, the, ashikaga, shogunate, came, to, end, the, authority, of, the, imperial, court, of, emperor, gimachi, also, began, to, fall, this, trend, reversed, after, oda, nobunaga, entered, kyoto, in, a, show, of, allegiance, that, indicated, that, the, emperor, had, the, oda, clan, s, support, in, 1574, nobunaga, appointed, a, rank, of, lower, third, rank, ju, sanmi, of, the, imperial, court, and, made, a, court, advisor, sangi, court, appointments, would, continue, to, be, lavished, on, a, nearly, annual, basis, possibly, in, hope, of, placating, him, nobunaga, acquired, many, official, titles, including, major, counselor, gondainagon, general, of, the, right, of, the, imperial, army, ukon, etaish, and, minister, of, the, right, udaijin, in, 1576, azuchi, castle, was, built, from, 1576, to, 1579, on, mount, azuchi, on, the, eastern, shore, of, lake, biwa, in, mi, province, nobunaga, intentionally, built, azuchi, castle, close, enough, to, kyoto, that, he, could, watch, over, and, guard, the, approaches, to, the, capital, azuchi, castle, s, location, was, also, strategically, advantageous, in, managing, the, communications, and, transportation, routes, between, nobunaga, s, greatest, foes, uesugi, to, the, north, the, takeda, in, the, east, and, the, m, ri, to, the, west, the, castle, and, its, nearby, town, were, depicted, on, the, so, called, azuchi, screens, which, oda, nobunaga, gifted, to, pope, gregory, xiii, who, displayed, them, in, the, vatican, collections, the, fundamental, policy, of, the, m, ri, clan, was, to, avoid, conflict, with, nobunaga, and, in, the, early, 1570s, even, when, some, issues, arose, they, continued, a, cautious, diplomacy, to, prevent, any, decisive, confrontations, however, when, terumoto, placed, ashikaga, yoshiaki, under, his, protection, war, between, the, two, families, became, inevitable, it, happened, in, 1576, at, battle, of, kizugawaguchi, that, the, m, ri, were, to, be, drawn, into, the, ishiyama, hongan, ji, war, nobunaga, s, siege, of, a, religious, stronghold, in, settsu, which, he, had, begun, in, 1570, terumoto, turned, to, the, vaunted, m, ri, navy, in, 1576, first, battle, of, kizugawaguchi, nobunaga, s, admiral, kuki, yoshitaka, had, cut, the, honganji, s, sea, lanes, and, sat, in, blockade, off, the, coast, terumoto, ordered, his, fleet, commanded, by, murakami, takeyoshi, to, make, for, the, waters, off, settsu, and, once, there, the, navy, inflicted, an, embarrassing, defeat, on, kuki, and, opened, the, honganji, s, supply, lines, later, in, 1578, at, second, battle, of, kizugawaguchi, k, ki, yoshitaka, defeat, takeyoshi, and, drove, the, m, ri, away, a, further, attempt, by, the, m, ri, to, break, the, blockade, the, following, year, was, turned, back, and, in, 1580, the, honganji, surrendered, the, conflict, between, oda, and, uesugi, precipitated, by, uesugi, intervention, in, the, domain, of, the, hatakeyama, clan, in, noto, province, an, oda, client, state, this, event, provoked, the, uesugi, incursion, a, coup, d, tat, led, by, the, pro, oda, general, ch, tsugutsura, who, killed, hatakeyama, yoshinori, the, lord, of, noto, and, replaced, him, with, hatakeyama, yoshitaka, as, a, puppet, ruler, as, a, result, uesugi, kenshin, the, head, of, the, uesugi, clan, mobilized, an, army, and, led, it, into, noto, against, tsugutsura, consequently, nobunaga, sent, an, army, led, by, shibata, katsuie, and, some, of, his, most, experienced, generals, to, attack, kenshin, they, clashed, at, the, battle, of, tedorigawa, in, kaga, province, in, 1577, in, november, 1577, the, battle, of, tedorigawa, took, place, near, the, tedori, river, in, kaga, province, kenshin, tricked, nobunaga, s, forces, into, launching, a, frontal, attack, across, the, tedorigawa, and, defeated, him, having, suffered, the, loss, of, 1, 000, men, the, oda, withdrew, south, the, result, was, a, decisive, uesugi, victory, and, nobunaga, considered, ceding, the, northern, provinces, to, kenshin, but, kenshin, s, sudden, death, in, early, 1578, caused, a, succession, crisis, that, ended, the, uesugi, s, movement, to, the, south, 12, 13, 228, 230, 288, the, tensh, iga, war, tensh, iga, no, ran, was, two, invasions, of, iga, province, by, the, oda, clan, during, the, sengoku, period, the, province, was, conquered, by, oda, nobunaga, in, 1581, after, an, unsuccessful, attempt, in, 1579, by, his, son, oda, nobukatsu, the, name, of, the, war, is, derived, from, the, tensh, era, name, 1573, 92, in, which, it, occurred, other, names, for, the, campaign, include, the, attack, on, iga, iga, zeme, or, pacification, of, iga, iga, heitei, oda, nobunaga, himself, toured, the, conquered, province, in, early, november, 1581, and, then, withdrew, his, troops, placing, control, in, nobukatsu, s, hands, by, 1580s, nobunaga, was, the, most, powerful, lord, in, japan, controlling, 20, provinces, in, central, japan, owari, mino, omi, iga, ise, yamato, yamashiro, kawachi, wakasa, settsu, echizen, hida, kaga, noto, tango, tanba, harima, inaba, tajima, and, h, ki, 309, 10, by, 1582, nobunaga, was, at, the, height, of, his, power, and, as, the, most, powerful, warlord, the, de, facto, leader, of, japan, oda, nobunaga, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, finally, occupied, shinano, and, kai, province, defeated, the, takeda, at, the, battle, of, tenmokuzan, destroying, the, clan, and, resulting, in, takeda, katsuyori, fleeing, from, the, battle, before, committing, suicide, with, his, wife, while, being, pursued, by, oda, forces, by, this, point, nobunaga, was, preparing, to, launch, invasions, into, etchu, province, shikoku, and, mori, clan, domain, nobunaga, s, former, sandal, bearer, hashiba, hideyoshi, invaded, bitch, province, and, laid, siege, to, takamatsu, castle, the, castle, was, vital, to, the, mori, clan, and, losing, it, would, have, left, mori, s, home, domain, vulnerable, more, reinforcements, led, by, m, ri, terumoto, arrived, to, relieve, the, siege, prompting, hideyoshi, to, ask, in, turn, for, reinforcements, from, nobunaga, nobunaga, immediately, ordered, his, leading, generals, and, also, akechi, mitsuhide, to, prepare, their, armies, with, the, overall, expedition, to, be, led, by, nobunaga, 241, 307a, nobunaga, left, azuchi, castle, for, honn, ji, a, temple, in, kyoto, he, frequented, when, visiting, the, city, where, he, was, to, hold, a, tea, ceremony, hence, nobunaga, only, had, 30, pages, with, him, while, his, son, oda, nobutada, had, brought, 2, 000, of, his, cavalrymen, 243, akechi, mitsuhide, stationed, in, the, tanba, province, led, his, army, toward, kyoto, under, the, pretense, of, following, the, order, of, nobunaga, but, as, they, were, crossing, katsura, river, he, decided, to, assassinate, nobunaga, for, unknown, reasons, and, the, cause, of, his, betrayal, is, controversial, mitsuhide, aware, that, nobunaga, was, nearby, and, unprotected, for, his, tea, ceremony, saw, an, opportunity, to, act, at, that, time, mitsuhide, is, said, to, have, announced, to, his, troops, that, the, enemy, awaits, at, honn, ji, teki, wa, honn, ji, ni, ari, but, this, is, a, later, creation, in, reality, mitsuhide, kept, the, target, of, the, attack, secret, from, his, troops, so, that, information, would, not, leak, out, on, 21, june, 1582, before, dawn, the, akechi, army, surrounded, the, honn, ji, temple, with, nobunaga, present, while, another, unit, of, akechi, troops, was, sent, to, my, kaku, ji, in, a, coup, although, nobunaga, and, his, servants, resisted, the, unexpected, intrusion, they, were, soon, overwhelmed, nobunaga, also, fought, back, for, a, while, before, retreating, and, after, letting, the, court, ladies, escape, he, committed, seppuku, in, one, of, the, inner, rooms, after, capturing, honn, ji, mitsuhide, attacked, nobutada, the, eldest, son, and, heir, of, nobunaga, who, also, died, by, suicide, 307, 08, mitsuhide, searched, for, nobunaga, s, body, but, could, not, find, it, as, a, result, he, was, unable, to, prove, nobunaga, s, death, thus, neither, providing, justification, for, his, rebellion, nor, gaining, support, from, those, who, doubted, nobunaga, s, death, later, when, nobunaga, s, retainer, toyotomi, hideyoshi, learnt, of, his, lord, s, death, he, intercepted, mitsuhide, s, messenger, trying, to, deliver, a, letter, to, the, m, ri, clan, informing, them, of, nobunaga, s, death, and, requesting, an, alliance, and, withheld, information, hideyoshi, managed, to, pacify, the, m, ri, by, demanding, the, suicide, of, shimizu, muneharu, in, exchange, for, ending, his, siege, of, takamatsu, castle, which, the, m, ri, accepted, he, then, turned, back, to, kyoto, with, his, forces, in, a, swift, forced, march, known, as, the, ch, goku, gaeshi, mitsuhide, failed, to, establish, his, position, after, nobunaga, s, death, and, oda, forces, under, hideyoshi, defeated, his, army, at, the, battle, of, yamazaki, in, july, 1582, mitsuhide, was, killed, as, a, victim, of, ochimusha, gari, during, a, losing, battle, hideyoshi, continued, and, completed, nobunaga, s, conquest, of, japan, within, the, following, decade, the, goal, of, national, unification, and, a, return, to, the, comparative, political, stability, of, the, earlier, muromachi, period, was, widely, shared, by, the, multitude, of, autonomous, daimy, during, the, sengoku, period, oda, nobunaga, was, the, first, for, whom, this, goal, seemed, attainable, he, controlled, most, of, honshu, shortly, before, his, death, in, the, honn, ji, incident, of, 1582, the, motive, for, the, rebellion, of, akechi, mitsuhide, the, vassal, who, betrayed, nobunaga, remains, unclear, partly, because, mitsuhide, himself, did, not, say, anything, and, various, theories, are, still, being, discussed, after, the, incident, mitsuhide, declared, to, the, world, that, he, would, rule, over, nobunaga, s, territory, but, was, soon, defeated, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, the, loss, of, his, position, and, power, so, quickly, gave, rise, to, the, idiom, mikka, tenka, lit, a, three, day, reign, later, hideyoshi, succeeded, in, regaining, oda, s, territory, and, wrested, control, of, it, from, the, oda, clan, further, expanding, his, dominion, greatly, and, when, he, was, appointed, to, the, highest, rank, of, kuge, kanpaku, despite, being, a, common, born, samurai, and, in, 1590, eight, years, after, the, incident, he, achieved, the, unification, of, japan, after, the, death, of, hideyoshi, tokugawa, ieyasu, completed, the, goal, of, national, unification, by, subjugating, local, daimy, under, a, hereditary, shogunate, which, was, ultimately, accomplished, in, 1603, when, ieyasu, was, granted, the, title, of, shogun, by, emperor, go, y, zei, following, the, successful, sekigahara, campaign, of, 1600, the, nature, of, the, succession, of, power, through, the, three, daimy, is, reflected, in, a, well, known, japanese, idiom, nobunaga, pounds, the, national, rice, cake, hideyoshi, kneads, it, and, in, the, end, ieyasu, sits, down, and, eats, it, the, changing, character, of, power, through, nobunaga, hideyoshi, and, ieyasu, is, reflected, in, another, well, known, idiom, nobunaga, said, little, bird, sing, if, you, don, t, sing, i, will, kill, you, hideyoshi, said, little, bird, sing, if, you, don, t, sing, i, will, make, you, sing,

samurai, and, finished, them, as, statesmen, nobunaga, inherited, his, father, s, domain, at, the, age, of, 17, and, quickly, gained, control, of, owari, province, through, gekokujo, hideyoshi, started, his, career, in, nobunaga, s, army, as, an, ashigaru, but, quickly, rose, up, through, the, ranks, as, a, samurai, ieyasu, initially, fought, against, nobunaga, as, the, heir, of, a, rival, daimy, but, later, expanded, his, own, inheritance, through, a, profitable, alliance, with, nobunaga, 142, in, 1579, nobunaga, s, resignation, from, his, posts, as, udaijin, minister, of, the, right, and, ukonoe, no, daisho, right, general, of, the, imperial, guard, baffled, the, imperial, court, this, was, because, nobunaga, who, was, on, the, verge, of, unifying, the, country, did, not, hold, an, official, position, that, could, shake, the, authority, of, the, imperial, court, therefore, in, may, 1582, the, imperial, court, sent, a, message, to, nobunaga, offering, him, a, government, position, of, his, choice, among, sei, i, taish, gun, kanpaku, and, daj, daijin, however, nobunaga, did, not, give, a, clear, reply, and, the, honnoji, incident, took, place, so, it, remains, unclear, what, kind, of, government, scheme, nobunaga, had, in, mind, in, 1582, nobunaga, was, posthumously, promoted, and, given, the, title, of, daj, daijin, and, the, court, rank, of, junior, first, rank, ju, ichi, i, more, than, 300, years, later, in, 1917, he, was, further, promoted, and, given, the, rank, of, senior, first, rank, sh, ichi, i, in, the, addendum, to, lu, s, fr, is, s, 1582, annals, of, japan, on, nobunaga, s, death, it, is, stated, that, nobunaga, intended, to, conquer, china, according, to, fr, is, nobunaga, intended, to, organise, a, large, fleet, to, conquer, china, after, the, unification, of, japan, and, to, have, his, sons, divide, and, rule, the, territory, however, there, is, no, such, statement, in, japanese, sources, and, many, researchers, doubt, its, authenticity, according, to, lu, s, fr, is, s, history, of, japan, nobunaga, attempted, to, deify, himself, in, his, later, years, by, building, s, ken, ji, in, part, of, azuchi, castle, and, installing, a, stone, called, bonsan, as, a, deity, to, replace, him, frois, a, christian, attributes, this, to, nobunaga, s, arrogance, which, drove, him, to, the, madness, of, wanting, to, be, worshipped, on, earth, and, the, honn, ji, incident, was, his, punishment, many, researchers, doubt, the, authenticity, of, frois, s, description, as, there, is, no, mention, of, this, in, the, japanese, sources, however, the, existence, of, bonsan, itself, is, mentioned, in, shinch, k, ki, as, for, the, reason, for, his, self, deification, it, is, thought, that, it, was, to, give, legitimacy, to, those, with, oda, family, blood, to, rule, the, country, with, a, view, to, after, the, unification, of, the, country, later, after, their, deaths, hideyoshi, and, ieyasu, willed, themselves, to, be, worshipped, as, deities, with, hideyoshi, being, deified, as, toyokuni, daimy, jin, and, ieyasu, as, t, sh, daigongen, in, japan, there, have, been, no, small, number, of, persons, who, have, become, gods, since, ancient, times, however, they, were, deified, by, others, after, they, died, as, human, beings, whereas, these, three, are, very, unique, in, that, they, willingly, tried, to, become, gods, before, they, died, nobunaga, led, a, large, army, to, kyoto, in, honour, of, ashikaga, shogun, yoshiaki, and, re, established, the, muromachi, shogunate, under, which, he, extended, his, power, into, the, kinai, region, the, conventional, theory, is, that, nobunaga, aimed, from, the, outset, to, overthrow, the, muromachi, shogunate, and, clan, system, and, with, yoshiaki, at, the, top, to, seize, real, power, himself, that, is, to, establish, a, puppet, government, in, recent, years, however, a, theory, has, emerged, that, nobunaga, and, yoshiaki, were, good, partners, and, that, the, final, breakdown, was, due, to, yoshiaki, s, betrayal, of, nobunaga, and, that, nobunaga, did, not, originally, intend, to, overthrow, the, muromachi, shogunate, as, for, the, imperial, court, it, was, conventionally, believed, that, nobunaga, tried, to, put, pressure, on, the, imperial, court, and, destroy, the, existing, order, in, recent, years, however, it, has, begun, to, be, thought, that, nobunaga, may, have, consistently, valued, the, emperor, and, the, imperial, court, for, the, emperors, and, court, nobles, who, had, lost, their, territories, to, the, samurais, and, were, forced, to, live, in, poverty, without, access, to, financial, resources, nobunaga, was, a, reliable, daimy, who, made, huge, donations, and, for, nobunaga, his, links, with, the, imperial, court, helped, to, improve, the, oda, clan, s, brand, image, after, conquering, owari, and, mino, nobunaga, used, the, seal, of, tenka, fubu, to, promote, his, vision, with, a, view, to, unifying, the, country, tenkafubu, means, spreading, military, power, throughout, the, world, and, it, is, the, idea, of, ruling, the, country, peacefully, in, other, words, ending, the, warring, states, period, and, restoring, peace, and, order, he, then, put, into, action, a, plan, for, the, economic, development, of, the, areas, he, controlled, starting, with, the, matchlock, gun, nobunaga, paved, the, way, for, unifying, the, country, through, a, chain, of, innovations, from, the, development, of, military, technology, and, new, weapons, to, the, international, supply, chain, for, importing, raw, materials, for, ammunition, to, the, development, of, domestic, distribution, networks, to, the, way, the, territory, was, governed, those, innovations, were, supported, by, the, financial, resources, obtained, through, his, economic, plans, oda, nobunaga, is, known, for, his, implementation, of, a, series, of, innovative, policies, such, as, rakuichi, rakuza, and, the, abolition, of, the, barrier, system, nobunaga, knew, that, his, grandfather, and, father, had, gained, wealth, from, the, water, transportation, of, ise, bay, by, taking, control, of, tsushima, and, atsuta, ports, he, himself, also, promoted, the, commercialization, of, his, territory, by, increasing, the, circulation, of, goods, and, money, through, the, above, policies, the, funds, to, procure, and, operate, the, soldiers, guns, and, other, weapons, that, supported, the, unification, of, the, country, were, also, obtained, through, this, rakuichi, rakuza, is, an, economic, policy, that, aims, to, revitalize, commerce, by, making, it, possible, for, anyone, to, do, business, anywhere, rakuichi, was, to, allow, people, to, do, business, anywhere, in, the, castle, town, whereas, previously, they, could, only, do, business, in, designated, areas, rakuza, does, not, recognize, the, privileges, of, a, monopoly, trade, association, called, za, and, guarantees, free, business, at, that, time, samurai, families, controlled, the, farmlands, and, farmers, while, temples, shrines, and, court, nobles, controlled, the, commerce, and, distribution, industry, by, controlling, the, ichi, market, and, za, union, nobunaga, s, promotion, of, raku, ichi, raku, za, was, intended, to, deprive, temples, shrines, and, court, nobles, of, their, privileges, and, allow, the, warrior, class, to, dominate, the, territory, in, all, areas, nobunaga, abolished, the, barrier, posts, within, his, domain, and, allowed, the, free, passage, of, goods, he, also, ordered, the, construction, and, improvement, of, roads, and, bridges, of, the, kinai, region, he, built, bridges, across, inlets, and, rivers, chiseled, out, rocks, to, make, steep, roads, more, gradual, widened, roads, to, three, and, a, half, meters, and, planted, pine, trees, and, willows, on, both, sides, of, them, nobunaga, developed, not, only, land, transportation, but, also, maritime, transportation, including, the, waterways, of, lake, biwa, and, the, sea, routes, of, ise, bay, and, the, seto, inland, sea, these, measures, enabled, not, only, the, free, passage, of, people, but, also, the, free, transportation, of, goods, thus, facilitating, distribution, the, development, of, logistics, has, brought, benefits, not, only, economically, but, also, militarily, allowing, soldiers, and, munitions, to, be, delivered, to, the, battlefield, quickly, and, reliably, in, general, nobunaga, thought, in, terms, of, unifying, factors, in, the, words, of, george, sansom, 300, 2, the, sengoku, daimy, of, the, time, did, not, change, their, strongholds, and, had, to, return, to, their, home, after, each, battle, making, it, difficult, for, the, takeda, uesugi, and, other, clans, far, from, kyoto, to, go, to, kyoto, however, nobunaga, continued, to, move, his, stronghold, as, his, territory, expanded, in, order, to, control, kyoto, which, was, essential, for, unifying, the, country, he, moved, from, one, base, to, another, from, shobata, kiyosu, komakiyama, gifu, and, azuchi, and, his, castle, in, osaka, the, diplomatic, and, economic, center, of, east, asia, was, under, construction, shortly, before, his, death, he, always, based, in, the, nodes, of, regional, distribution, and, ensured, the, maintenance, of, public, peace, in, the, area, thereby, promoting, the, development, of, the, local, economy, and, the, concentration, of, capital, in, the, cities, backed, by, his, enormous, economic, power, nobunaga, overwhelmed, his, opponents, by, building, stone, wall, castles, such, as, komakiyama, castle, and, azuchi, castle, which, consumed, more, labor, and, financial, resources, than, conventional, castles, and, by, constructing, economic, cities, castle, towns, connected, to, them, in, other, words, nobunaga, politically, appealed, his, power, throughout, the, country, through, civil, engineering, projects, such, as, the, construction, of, castles, toyotomi, hideyoshi, followed, suit, and, built, ishigakiyama, castle, and, osaka, castle, nobunaga, implemented, financial, reforms, that, introduced, a, new, monetary, system, in, 1569, the, oda, nobunaga, eiroku, 12, law, was, enacted, which, is, regarded, by, some, as, the, beginning, of, early, modern, monetary, policy, in, japan, it, was, an, epoch, making, attempt, to, increase, the, volume, of, money, in, circulation, and, prevent, the, inflow, of, bad, money, at, the, same, time, a, fixed, exchange, rate, system, was, introduced, and, coins, which, had, been, mixed, in, disorderly, fashion, were, clearly, defined, as, standard, coins, and, deteriorated, coins, the, oda, clan, s, guarantee, has, given, value, to, coins, that, were, considered, degraded, coins, in, other, regions, revived, many, coins, that, had, been, excluded, from, trade, and, stabilised, commercial, transactions, at, the, same, time, by, differentiating, the, value, of, coins, according, to, their, exchange, rate, the, government, prevented, an, excessive, influx, of, deteriorated, coins, nobunaga, also, used, gold, and, silver, as, currency, to, trade, in, high, value, commodities, nobunaga, himself, played, a, role, in, expanding, the, circulation, of, gold, and, silver, by, using, gold, and, silver, for, purchases, in, meibutsu, gari, lit, specialty, hunting, one, of, the, attainments, of, nobunaga, s, government, which, aimed, to, unify, the, country, was, oda, kenchi, lit, oda, land, survey, which, began, in, earnest, in, 1580, starting, with, the, kinai, region, it, is, an, administrative, measure, that, requires, the, daimy, under, his, command, to, submit, their, harvest, in, the, form, of, kokudaka, figures, this, was, succeeded, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, taik, kenchi, lit, taik, land, survey, when, asked, by, the, emperor, and, the, muromachi, shogun, to, assume, the, post, of, vice, shogun, and, offered, the, post, of, kanrei, which, was, effectively, the, highest, rank, in, samurai, society, nobunaga, declined, and, instead, requested, permission, to, rule, directly, over, three, of, japan, s, largest, distribution, centres, sakai, izumi, province, kusatsu, and, tsu, mi, province, sakai, an, autonomous, city, was, enjoying, its, golden, days, as, an, international, trading, port, overflowing, with, goods, the, latest, science, and, technology, and, information, from, east, asia, and, the, west, despite, the, territorial, expansion, wars, of, the, sengoku, daimy, s, what, nobunaga, sought, from, the, merchants, of, sakai, was, their, enormous, wealth, as, well, as, their, expertise, in, the, nanban, trade, and, their, own, trade, routes, to, obtain, raw, materials, for, guns, and, gunpowder, nobunaga, took, imai, s, ky, an, upstart, merchant, from, sakai, under, his, control, imai, established, japan, s, first, comprehensive, military, industry, and, supported, nobunaga, s, unification, of, japan, by, mass, producing, guns, and, securing, an, exclusive, trading, route, for, the, import, of, potassium, nitrate, a, raw, material, for, gunpowder, that, was, not, produced, in, japan, tsuda, s, gy, a, key, figure, in, sakai, s, self, governing, organization, also, severed, ties, with, hongan, ji, and, submitted, to, nobunaga, nobunaga, demanded, a, large, amount, of, war, funds, from, sakai, sakai, merchants, initially, refused, but, were, persuaded, by, s, ky, and, s, gy, to, accept, it, thus, nobunaga, obtained, sakai, without, fighting, imai, s, ky, tsuda, s, gy, and, sen, s, eki, later, sen, no, rikyu, were, appointed, as, nobunaga, s, tea, masters, and, secured, their, positions, as, political, merchants, nobunaga, made, personnel, decisions, based, on, ability, and, results, not, titles, until, then, the, family, culture, of, warlords, had, been, one, of, respecting, family, lineage, and, passing, down, positions, from, generation, to, generation, but, nobunaga, made, a, major, shift, to, a, personnel, system, based, on, merit, it, is, known, that, hashiba, hideyoshi, came, from, a, poor, peasant, background, in, owari, while, akechi, mitsuhide, came, from, a, samurai, background, in, mino, but, had, spent, a, long, time, as, a, poor, ronin, these, two, men, caught, up, with, and, eventually, overtook, nobunaga, s, old, vassals, including, shibata, katsuie, niwa, nagahide, sakuma, nobumori, and, others, among, the, oda, vassals, mitsuhide, was, the, first, to, become, the, lord, of, one, province, and, one, castle, and, the, second, was, hideyoshi, this, was, unthinkable, for, other, sengoku, daimy, militarily, nobunaga, changed, the, way, war, was, fought, in, japan, an, unprecedented, military, revolution, was, taking, place, in, japan, at, the, time, through, a, military, revolution, using, the, new, technology, of, matchlock, guns, he, ended, the, sengoku, period, of, decentralization, and, moved, japan, into, the, early, modern, era, of, centralization, nobunaga, was, the, first, of, the, other, sengoku, daimyo, to, own, and, utilise, a, large, number, of, firearms, from, an, early, date, he, changed, the, perception, that, matchlock, guns, commonly, known, as, tanegashima, were, unsuitable, for, actual, combat, due, to, their, short, range, and, inability, to, fire, continuously, to, the, perception, that, they, were, invincible, weapons, by, deploying, in, large, numbers, firing, them, all, at, once, local, historiography, kunitomo, teppoki, states, that, nobunaga, had, already, recognised, the, potential, of, guns, in, 1549, six, years, after, they, were, introduced, to, japan, and, put, hashimoto, ippa, in, charge, of, gun, production, and, that, 500, guns, were, completed, in, 1550, shinch, k, ki, also, mentions, that, he, learnt, marksmanship, from, hashimoto, ippa, around, 1550, four, years, later, in, 1554, he, fielded, guns, for, the, first, time, at, the, battle, of, muraki, castle, where, nobunaga, replaced, his, guns, one, after, the, other, and, fired, them, himself, taking, the, fort, in, a, single, day, the, battle, of, nagashino, in, 1575, is, famous, for, the, continuous, firing, of, guns, but, nobunaga, had, already, carried, it, out, 21, years, earlier, documents, left, behind, in, sakai, which, was, under, the, direct, control, of, nobunaga, describing, the, manufacture, of, guns, reveal, that, japan, had, already, become, the, world, s, leading, gun, power, with, mass, production, based, on, a, division, of, labour, for, each, part, radiological, analysis, also, revealed, that, japanese, made, guns, using, the, japanese, sword, forging, technique, were, more, stable, in, strength, and, more, powerful, because, they, contained, fewer, impurities, although, a, mass, production, system, for, guns, had, been, established, there, was, still, no, daimy, capable, of, providing, a, stable, supply, of, ammunition, nobunaga, was, the, first, to, make, this, possible, he, had, established, an, international, supply, chain, to, import, raw, materials, for, ammunition, from, china, and, southeast, asia, through, portuguese, merchants, by, putting, international, port, cities, such, as, sakai, under, his, direct, control, and, protecting, the, jesuits, later, during, the, tokugawa, period, japan, exported, large, quantities, of, no, longer, needed, firearms, to, the, netherlands, along, with, swords, and, other, weapons, nobunaga, had, the, previously, disparate, spear, lengths, aligned, to, 3, ken, about, 5, 5, metres, or, 18, ft, or, 3, and, a, half, ken, about, 6, 4, metres, or, 21, ft, the, spear, lengths, used, in, the, sengoku, period, were, generally, 2, ken, 3, 6, metres, or, 12, ft, however, when, nobunaga, was, a, teenager, he, saw, his, comrades, beating, each, other, with, spears, in, a, mock, battle, and, had, his, army, replace, their, own, spears, with, longer, ones, as, short, spears, were, useless, the, way, spears, were, used, in, those, days, was, for, miscellaneous, soldiers, under, ashigaru, with, long, spears, to, form, a, line, and, advance, swinging, their, spears, down, from, above, as, if, they, were, striking, rather, than, stabbing, this, alone, was, powerful, enough, and, if, the, long, spearmen, formed, a, yaribusuma, lit, line, of, spears, with, their, spearheads, facing, forward, they, could, sufficiently, counter, cavalry, units, so, the, effect, was, enormous, nobunaga, introduced, civil, engineering, not, only, in, the, political, field, but, also, in, the, military, field, he, turned, the, battle, into, a, large, scale, civil, engineering, project, this, was, clearly, beyond, the, scope, of, preparations, for, a, favorable, outcome, of, the, war, he, invaded, enemy, territory, in, force, mobilizing, construction, workers, carpenters, blacksmiths, founders, miners, and, others, to, construct, roads, and, build, tsunagi, jiro, linking, castle, in, attacking, castles, he, adopted, the, tsukejiro, attaching, castle, strategy, of, which, building, numerous, fortifications, around, enemy, castles, and, narrowing, the, siege, while, moving, toyotomi, hideyoshi, took, charge, of, the, works, as, a, field, supervisor, under, nobunaga, and, later, took, over, his, methods, nobunaga, is, thought, to, have, favored, gambling, tactics, such, as, surprise, attacks, because, of, the, battle, of, okehazama, but, in, reality, he, preferred, to, use, overwhelming, military, power, to, overpower, his, opponents, nobunaga, tried, to, create, a, standing, army, by, implementing, the, separation, of, soldiers, and, farmers, samurais, at, that, time, were, half, farmers, and, half, soldiers, who, spent, most, of, their, time, as, farmers, and, only, fought, at, the, behest, of, their, lords, who, were, also, the, owners, of, the, farmland, in, times, of, war, therefore, they, could, not, fight, much, during, the, busy, farming, season, from, summer, to, autumn, nobunaga, on, the, other, hand, attempted, to, separate, soldiers, from, farmers, although, not, as, thoroughly, as, toyotomi, hideyoshi, later, did, each, time, nobunaga, moved, his, base, of, operations, he, promoted, the, concentration, of, his, vassals, under, his, castles, as, a, result, the, separation, of, troops, and, agriculture, was, promoted, allowing, for, planned, group, training, and, the, formation, of, army, units, of, different, types, sonae, lit, preparation, such, as, firearms, units, and, cavalry, units, daimyo, s, bodyguards, and, messengers, were, called, umamawari, sh, lit, horse, related, group, and, nobunaga, divided, them, into, two, groups, one, group, had, a, red, horo, cloak, on, their, backs, so, they, were, called, akahoro, sh, lit, red, mantle, group, and, the, other, had, a, black, horo, cloak, on, their, backs, so, they, were, called, kurohoro, sh, lit, black, mantle, group, the, leader, of, akahoro, sh, was, maeda, toshiie, and, the, leader, of, kurohoro, sh, was, sassa, narimasa, nobunaga, placed, great, importance, on, intelligence, warfare, after, the, battle, of, okehazama, he, most, highly, valued, yanada, masatsuna, who, reported, every, movement, of, the, imagawa, forces, that, day, rather, than, the, samurais, who, actually, defeated, yoshimoto, nobunaga, adopted, a, system, of, area, armies, which, enabled, him, to, react, in, multiple, regions, simultaneously, and, operated, it, in, a, large, scale, nobunaga, s, army, had, an, unthinkable, military, rule, known, as, the, issen, giri, lit, cutting, people, for, a, penny, whereby, all, vassals, including, ashigaru, and, lower, ranking, ones, were, to, be, put, to, death, if, they, stole, even, a, single, penny, in, those, days, it, was, common, practice, for, sengoku, daimyo, such, as, takeda, and, uesugi, to, allow, their, vassals, to, raid, nearby, villages, pillage, and, assault, them, if, they, won, a, battle, they, rather, entered, the, war, for, the, profits, to, be, gained, from, the, looting, after, the, battle, was, over, it, was, also, common, for, traffickers, to, set, up, markets, to, sell, the, captured, people, however, nobunaga, denied, this, and, forbade, the, soldiers, under, his, command, from, looting, and, violence, against, the, people, on, the, contrary, food, and, other, supplies, were, bought, for, a, price, furthermore, he, took, a, tough, attitude, towards, roadside, bandits, who, stood, in, the, way, of, trade, as, a, result, after, nobunaga, united, owari, security, improved, to, the, extent, that, merchants, could, take, naps, on, the, roadside, these, actions, enabled, nobunaga, to, gain, the, support, of, the, people, and, move, towards, unifying, the, country, strict, military, discipline, was, inherited, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, who, recognized, it, as, an, important, factor, in, gaining, public, support, nobunaga, is, said, to, have, used, six, armored, ships, in, the, second, battle, of, kizugawaguchi, in, 1578, nobunaga, who, suffered, a, heavy, blow, at, the, first, battle, of, the, kizugawaguchi, from, h, raku, hiya, of, the, murakami, suigun, the, core, of, the, mori, suigun, ordered, kuki, yoshitaka, to, build, iron, armoured, ships, to, repel, the, mori, suigun, attempting, to, bring, provisions, and, other, supplies, to, the, osaka, hongan, ji, they, are, thought, to, have, been, large, wooden, ships, atakebune, covered, with, iron, plates, with, cannons, on, the, front, and, arrows, and, guns, on, the, sides, with, two, or, three, tiers, of, turrets, on, the, upper, deck, however, as, no, actual, ships, have, survived, and, historical, documents, are, inadequately, described, there, are, many, theories, about, the, appearance, and, structure, of, iron, armoured, ships, some, believe, that, they, were, not, actually, iron, armoured, ships, but, simply, european, style, black, ships, or, that, they, may, not, have, been, completely, covered, with, iron, plates, but, only, important, parts, were, covered, with, iron, it, is, also, said, that, iron, armoured, ships, were, intended, to, intimidate, rather, than, attack, and, could, not, move, much, themselves, and, were, more, like, fortress, like, ships, floating, on, the, sea, in, tamon, in, eishun, s, tamon, in, diary, there, are, passages, which, state, that, the, ship, was, a, ship, of, iron, and, prepared, to, prevent, guns, bullets, from, going, through, and, this, is, the, only, historical, document, that, provides, evidence, that, the, ship, was, armoured, with, iron, plates, some, argue, that, since, tamon, in, diary, is, a, primary, historical, source, its, account, should, be, trusted, but, it, is, only, hearsay, and, was, not, witnessed, by, eishun, himself, on, the, other, hand, the, jesuit, missionary, organtino, who, actually, observed, the, ships, wrote, in, his, report, that, it, resembled, a, portuguese, ship, and, was, surprised, that, such, a, ship, had, been, built, in, japan, if, they, were, similar, to, the, portuguese, ships, of, the, time, galleons, it, is, assumed, that, they, would, have, been, very, different, from, atakebune, a, keelless, riverboat, the, ships, were, also, said, to, be, equipped, with, three, cannons, and, numerous, elaborate, and, large, long, guns, shinch, k, ki, manuscript, mentions, that, big, guns, were, powerful, in, naval, battles, but, does, not, say, whether, they, were, actually, iron, armoured, nobunaga, initiated, a, period, in, japanese, art, history, known, as, fushimi, or, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, in, reference, to, the, area, south, of, kyoto, he, built, extensive, gardens, and, castles, which, were, themselves, great, works, of, art, azuchi, castle, included, a, seven, story, tenshukaku, which, included, a, treasury, filled, with, gold, and, precious, objects, works, of, art, included, paintings, on, movable, screens, by, bu, sliding, doors, fusuma, and, walls, by, kan, eitoku, 380, 82, nobunaga, promoted, the, tea, ceremony, not, only, that, he, is, said, to, have, built, trust, with, his, subordinates, by, successfully, utilizing, the, system, for, political, use, of, the, tea, ceremony, which, toyotomi, hideyoshi, later, named, onchanoyu, goseido, lit, tea, ceremony, politics, he, actively, promoted, the, value, of, the, tea, ceremony, in, samurai, society, giving, it, a, value, equal, to, the, fiefdom, and, rank, he, received, from, his, lord, he, transformed, the, values, of, the, samurai, through, the, following, three, actions, nobunaga, held, tea, ceremonies, with, limited, participants, and, showed, his, authority, by, displaying, his, tea, utensils, making, it, known, that, the, tea, ceremony, was, a, samurai, ritual, he, forbade, his, vassals, to, hold, tea, ceremonies, but, allowed, those, who, made, special, achievements, to, hold, tea, ceremonies, by, giving, them, tea, utensils, the, vassals, then, began, to, take, pleasure, in, nobunaga, s, bestowal, of, specialties, and, to, feel, great, honor, in, being, allowed, to, hold, tea, ceremonies, thus, among, the, warriors, the, specialty, tea, utensils, and, the, holding, of, tea, ceremonies, became, of, special, value, and, they, began, to, covet, tea, utensils, more, than, the, territory, given, to, them, by, their, lord, nobunaga, was, famous, for, his, great, love, of, sumo, and, frequently, held, sumo, tournaments, at, j, raku, ji, in, azuchi, between, 1570, and, 1581, the, year, before, his, death, in, the, beginning, the, tournament, attracted, braggarts, from, all, over, mi, province, but, gradually, it, began, to, draw, from, kyoto, and, other, regions, the, largest, tournament, was, held, in, 1578, at, mount, azuchi, with, 1, 500, participants, the, main, reason, for, organising, the, tournament, was, of, course, that, nobunaga, was, a, great, lover, of, sumo, but, there, was, also, the, practical, advantage, of, selecting, young, men, of, good, physique, and, martial, prowess, and, the, aim, was, to, demonstrate, nobunaga, s, authority, by, putting, on, a, big, show, while, at, the, same, time, relieving, popular, discontent, by, making, it, fun, for, everyone, regarding, the, relationship, between, nobunaga, and, sumo, there, is, a, theory, that, the, yumitorishiki, bow, twirling, ceremony, and, the, format, in, which, sumo, wrestlers, are, divided, into, east, and, west, and, judged, by, a, gy, ji, sumo, referee, were, born, out, of, the, sumo, tournament, organised, by, nobunaga, as, for, the, theory, that, nobunaga, is, the, origin, of, the, east, west, sumo, ranking, system, there, are, actually, historical, documents, in, omi, hachiman, city, that, support, this, relationship, in, 1581, nobunaga, who, was, enjoying, a, fire, festival, with, his, vassals, dressed, up, in, nanban, costumes, had, them, perform, take, zum, bamboo, wrestling, using, bamboos, of, firecracker, he, praised, the, two, boasts, of, strength, had, fought, to, a, draw, and, as, a, reward, he, gave, the, surnames, higashi, lit, east, to, denzo, who, entered, the, ring, from, the, east, and, nishi, lit, west, to, umejiro, who, entered, the, ring, from, the, west, it, is, said, that, razor, blades, became, popular, in, japan, when, nobunaga, oda, used, them, to, create, a, samurai, hair, style, sakayaki, the, razor, blade, is, said, to, have, arrived, in, japan, around, 538, this, was, the, year, that, buddhism, was, introduced, to, japan, and, razor, blades, were, also, introduced, as, a, buddhist, implement, for, monks, to, shave, their, heads, razor, blades, were, expensive, and, also, sacred, buddhist, implements, so, even, afterwards, it, remained, common, to, use, wooden, tweezers, for, grooming, hair, and, beards, samurai, warriors, also, used, tweezers, to, remove, hair, but, it, was, painful, time, consuming, and, caused, the, pores, to, become, fester, it, is, said, that, the, rationalist, nobunaga, therefore, shaved, sakayaki, with, a, razor, blade, which, led, to, the, use, of, razor, blades, among, samurai, shaving, the, sakayaki, was, a, fashionable, hairstyle, that, townspeople, began, to, imitate, and, became, established, in, the, edo, period, it, is, said, that, this, has, made, the, use, of, razor, blades, commonplace, for, the, general, public, the, first, known, african, person, in, japan, came, with, a, jesuit, delegation, in, 1579, and, was, then, employed, by, oda, nobunaga, for, 15, months, 1581, 1582, as, a, retainer, his, african, name, and, birthplace, are, unknown, he, was, given, the, name, yasuke, nobunaga, did, not, actively, believe, in, any, particular, god, or, buddha, himself, according, to, jesuit, scholar, lu, s, fr, is, he, told, people, there, was, no, afterlife, but, he, did, not, deny, that, he, was, an, adherent, of, hokke, sh, and, it, was, common, for, him, to, pray, for, victory, and, to, visit, temples, and, shrines, he, never, denied, or, suppressed, the, beliefs, of, others, for, any, reason, and, was, even, willing, to, help, and, shelter, them, if, they, asked, for, help, nobunaga, rather, respected, them, as, long, as, they, did, not, associate, with, the, various, daimy, s, or, meddle, in, politics, like, fixers, but, rather, devoted, themselves, to, their, main, task, as, religious, people, in, fact, for, temples, and, shrines, that, do, not, go, beyond, their, main, religious, duties, he, has, made, donations, paid, for, repairs, to, facilities, and, relieved, them, of, their, territories, it, is, sometimes, said, that, nobunaga, hated, buddhism, because, of, his, wars, with, hongan, ji, his, suppression, of, ikk, ikki, his, fire, attack, against, mt, hiei, and, his, attacks, on, mt, k, ya, but, this, is, a, great, misconception, it, is, true, that, he, showed, no, mercy, even, to, monks, but, this, was, not, because, he, hated, buddhism, there, is, a, saying, that, if, you, kill, a, monk, you, will, be, cursed, for, seven, generations, but, unlike, most, daimy, s, of, the, time, nobunaga, simply, did, not, have, such, a, taboo, nobunaga, only, fought, buddhist, forces, as, thoroughly, as, he, had, fought, other, sengoku, daimy, s, and, while, it, is, true, that, he, killed, thousands, of, monks, and, tens, of, thousands, of, believers, he, never, forbade, their, faith, itself, nobunaga, would, forgive, them, if, they, complied, with, his, advice, to, surrender, but, if, they, did, not, he, would, send, a, large, army, to, massacre, them, and, try, to, suppress, them, through, fear, the, ikk, sh, jodo, shinshu, hongwanji, order, was, very, powerful, at, the, time, the, osaka, hongan, ji, later, ishiyama, hongan, ji, was, an, armed, group, comparable, to, the, sengoku, daimy, controlling, territory, and, employing, as, mercenaries, the, saika, sh, of, kii, province, who, were, skilled, in, the, use, of, guns, the, ishiyama, hongan, ji, war, was, a, war, that, began, when, nobunaga, who, considered, osaka, his, future, base, ordered, the, osaka, honganji, to, withdraw, from, osaka, kennyo, issued, a, proclamation, to, his, followers, to, overthrow, nobunaga, and, they, rose, up, in, anti, nobunaga, ranks, hongwanji, then, laid, siege, to, nobunaga, with, takeda, asakura, azai, m, ri, and, others, ikk, ikki, were, a, nationwide, trans, religious, resistance, movement, against, lords, and, rulers, of, the, secular, realm, organized, by, the, hongwan, ji, order, nobunaga, attempted, to, isolate, the, osaka, hongan, ji, by, exterminating, the, ikk, ikki, in, various, parts, of, the, country, nobunaga, s, massacre, is, generally, criticized, but, there, is, also, the, view, that, nobunaga, had, no, choice, but, to, massacre, them, as, a, result, of, hongan, ji, temple, s, request, for, thorough, resistance, from, its, followers, in, the, case, of, mount, hiei, and, mount, koya, they, were, attacked, because, they, had, joined, the, daimy, s, who, were, hostile, to, nobunaga, or, sheltered, defeated, soldiers, nobunaga, allowed, the, jesuits, to, proselytise, christianity, and, sheltered, their, activities, in, japan, this, was, because, the, use, of, matchlocks, which, were, absolutely, necessary, for, warfare, was, impossible, without, the, nanban, trade, and, because, the, nanban, trade, required, jesuit, mediation, and, diplomacy, with, portugal, although, domestic, production, of, guns, themselves, had, already, begun, nitre, for, the, gunpowder, and, lead, for, the, bullets, were, rarely, produced, in, japan, at, the, time, so, the, only, way, to, secure, large, quantities, was, to, seize, routes, brought, in, from, overseas, by, portuguese, merchant, ships, the, jesuits, also, actively, backed, nobunaga, because, they, considered, him, to, be, the, closest, person, to, unifying, the, country, above, all, it, was, best, to, borrow, nobunaga, s, help, to, destroy, the, buddhist, power, which, was, their, greatest, enemy, lu, s, fr, is, described, nobunaga, in, his, history, of, japan, as, of, medium, height, and, lean, build, with, a, thin, moustache, and, a, very, clear, voice, regarding, his,

have, used, according, to, fr, is, he, had, great, understanding, and, clear, judgment, disdained, gods, buddha, and, other, idols, and, did, not, believe, in, any, pagan, divination, his, sect, was, the, lotus, sect, but, he, preached, in, high, spirits, that, there, is, no, creator, of, the, universe, that, the, spirit, is, not, immortal, and, that, nothing, exists, after, death, and, there, are, no, awards, or, punishments, in, the, afterlife, he, was, extremely, fond, of, warfare, devoted, to, the, practice, of, martial, arts, and, was, coarse, he, was, arrogant, but, honourable, strict, in, righteousness, and, enjoyed, the, deeds, of, justice, and, mercy, when, others, insulted, him, he, did, not, hesitate, to, punish, them, but, in, certain, matters, he, showed, amiability, and, mercy, he, was, also, temperamental, though, not, greedy, and, could, be, prone, to, temper, tantrums, he, was, secretive, in, his, decisions, and, extremely, cunning, in, his, strategies, he, was, magnanimous, and, patient, even, when, the, fortunes, of, war, seemed, to, be, against, him, he, had, a, somewhat, melancholy, shadow, but, when, it, came, to, difficult, schemes, he, was, fearless, and, people, followed, his, orders, in, everything, he, was, seldom, disciplined, rarely, swayed, by, the, advice, of, his, vassals, and, was, extremely, feared, and, respected, by, all, he, despised, all, the, daimy, of, japan, and, spoke, to, them, condescendingly, as, if, they, were, his, subordinate, retainers, and, the, people, obeyed, him, as, if, he, were, an, absolute, monarch, on, the, other, hand, he, also, spoke, cordially, with, a, very, lowly, and, despised, servant, he, did, not, drink, ate, sparingly, did, not, sleep, much, and, was, an, early, riser, he, liked, his, house, to, be, clean, and, was, meticulous, in, his, instructions, on, various, matters, when, talking, to, people, he, disliked, long, conversations, and, lengthy, preliminaries, he, particularly, liked, the, famous, vessels, of, the, tea, ceremony, good, horses, swords, and, falconry, he, also, loved, watching, people, perform, sumo, naked, in, front, of, him, regardless, of, status, nobunaga, s, many, great, achievements, were, also, thanks, to, the, education, of, his, father, nobuhide, originally, nobuhide, was, only, one, of, the, three, magistrates, of, kiyosu, rather, than, the, whole, of, owari, but, he, gained, so, much, power, that, he, overpowered, the, shugodai, who, ruled, owari, nobuhide, was, not, only, a, brilliant, military, man, but, was, also, a, well, known, cultural, figure, in, kyoto, however, he, believed, that, doing, the, same, thing, as, himself, at, the, turn, of, the, age, would, no, longer, work, did, not, give, nobunaga, the, same, education, as, himself, at, all, nobuhide, let, nobunaga, do, only, what, he, wanted, to, do, and, what, he, was, good, at, as, a, result, he, had, no, complexes, about, anything, or, anyone, a, letter, left, by, luis, frois, states, that, in, response, to, a, letter, from, takeda, shingen, signed, tendai, no, zasu, shamon, shingen, lit, the, head, priest, of, the, tendai, sect, monk, shingen, nobunaga,

tendai, sect, as, the, reason, for, his, hostility, to, nobunaga, and, to, emphasise, this, and, gain, support, from, buddhist, forces, he, took, the, name, of, tendai, zasu, indicating, that, he, was, the, head, of, enryaku, ji, in, reality, however, shingen, was, not, a, tendai, zasu, or, even, a, believer, in, the, tendai, sect, and, it, is, said, that, nobunaga, may, have, referred, to, himself, as, the, demon, king, to, mock, shingen, s, own, choice, of, title, the, young, nobunaga, was, famous, for, his, bizarre, outfit, and, eccentric, behaviour, and, people, called, him, utsuke, lit, great, fool, at, that, time, he, was, dressed, in, his, yukatabira, sleeves, removed, half, hakama, with, a, flint, pouch, and, others, hanging, from, it, his, hair, tied, into, a, chasen, mage, with, crimson, or, light, green, threads, a, sword, in, a, vermilion, sheath, and, all, his, attendants, carried, vermilion, arms, he, also, devoured, fruits, and, mochi, standing, up, without, caring, about, the, public, gaze, in, the, streets, or, walked, in, a, dishevelled, manner, leaning, on, others, or, hanging, on, their, shoulders, nobunaga, had, no, particular, pastimes, but, practised, horsemanship, in, the, morning, and, evening, and, from, spring, to, summer, he, would, go, into, the, river, to, practice, water, drills, he, also, learnt, archery, from, ichikawa, daisuke, marksmanship, from, hashimoto, ippa, and, military, tactics, from, hirata, sanmi, also, at, that, time, he, watched, a, mock, battle, using, bamboo, spears, and, said, that, spears, could, not, be, used, if, they, were, too, short, so, he, had, all, his, spears, replaced, with, longer, ones, of, 3, ken, 5, 4, metres, or, 18, ft, or, 3, and, a, half, ken, 6, 3, metres, or, 21, ft, at, the, funeral, of, his, father, nobuhide, his, younger, brother, nobuyuki, nobukatsu, wore, a, formal, kataginu, and, long, hakama, and, burnt, incense, according, to, etiquette, while, nobunaga, came, without, long, hakama, with, his, hair, tied, in, a, chasen, mage, a, tachi, sword, and, a, wakizashi, with, a, long, handle, wrapped, in, straw, rope, he, then, grabbed, some, powdered, incense, threw, it, at, the, tablets, and, walked, away, at, a, meeting, between, nobunaga, and, his, father, in, law, saito, d, san, d, san, sneaked, a, peek, to, determine, what, kind, of, man, his, son, in, law, was, before, they, actually, met, then, nobunaga, appeared, with, his, hair, tied, up, in, a, chasen, mage, with, a, light, green, flat, cord, wearing, a, yukatabira, with, one, sleeve, off, a, tachi, sword, and, wakizashi, with, gold, and, silver, flakes, pasted, on, the, sheath, and, the, long, handle, wrapped, in, straw, rope, a, thick, taro, stem, rope, as, an, arm, band, seven, or, eight, flint, pouches, and, gourds, hanging, around, his, waist, like, monkey, trainers, and, a, half, hakama, made, of, four, pieces, of, tiger, and, leopard, leather, according, to, r, jin, zatsuwa, a, compilation, of, stories, by, local, elders, he, also, had, a, large, picture, of, a, penis, dyed, on, the, back, of, his, yukatabira, on, the, other, hand, he, was, accompanied, by, a, large, contingent, of, a, peculiarly, organized, force, of, 500, long, spearmen, and, 500, archers, and, matchlock, troops, d, san, went, to, the, meeting, place, in, his, regular, clothes, thinking, that, he, would, not, need, formal, attire, if, he, were, to, meet, such, a, fool, but, nobunaga, changed, back, into, his, haori, and, long, hakama, and, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, he, appeared, in, formal, attire, with, his, hair, neatly, folded, in, futatsu, ori, on, the, way, home, d, san, s, retainers, laughed, at, him, saying, nobunaga, was, a, fool, after, all, but, d, san, replied, that, is, why, i, am, frustrated, my, children, will, be, under, the, command, of, that, fool, in, the, future, he, said, with, a, bitter, look, on, his, face, nowadays, oda, nobunaga, is, one, of, japan, s, most, popular, historical, figures, despite, his, brutal, image, nobunaga, is, widely, recognised, for, his, appeal, as, an, innovator, who, more, than, compensated, for, his, shortcomings, however, the, image, of, nobunaga, has, changed, significantly, during, the, edo, period, from, the, meiji, to, the, early, sh, wa, era, and, since, world, war, ii, oda, nobunaga, s, reputation, in, the, edo, period, was, rather, negative, overall, he, was, particularly, poorly, regarded, among, confucian, scholars, as, confucianism, was, then, shaping, the, new, fundamental, values, of, japan, this, was, because, the, ideal, politics, in, confucianism, was, the, royal, way, of, subduing, people, through, benevolence, and, the, hegemony, or, politics, of, restraining, people, through, force, and, trickery, like, nobunaga, s, was, considered, undesirable, the, biggest, hero, of, the, time, was, tokugawa, ieyasu, the, founder, of, the, edo, shogunate, but, he, had, a, surprisingly, low, public, profile, as, he, was, deified, and, could, not, be, easily, treated, in, popular, culture, the, most, popular, figure, among, the, common, people, was, hideyoshi, who, rose, from, peasant, to, ruler, of, the, country, in, the, late, edo, period, he, finally, received, high, praise, in, rai, san, y, s, nihon, gaishi, 1827, however, san, y, evaluated, nobunaga, from, the, perspective, of, imperial, ideology, more, than, he, evaluated, his, military, strategies, san, y, interpreted, nobunaga, s, project, to, unify, the, whole, country, as, being, in, the, interests, of, the, emperor, in, the, meiji, era, nobunaga, was, still, not, highly, regarded, this, changed, in, the, taish, era, when, the, journalist, tokutomi, soh, took, up, nobunaga, s, innovations, and, gave, him, high, praise, for, his, continuous, firing, of, guns, and, the, abolition, of, customs, checkpoints, however, what, soh, considered, most, important, was, still, nobunaga, as, a, kinnoka, imperialist, who, ended, the, shogunate, government, that, lasted, from, kamakura, to, muromachi, and, emphasized, the, imperial, court, with, militarism, on, the, rise, academism, also, encouraged, the, image, of, nobunaga, as, an, innovator, and, loyalist, on, the, other, hand, the, general, staff, of, the, former, imperial, japanese, army, studied, the, battles, of, okehazama, and, nagashino, and, highly, evaluated, nobunaga, as, a, tactician, however, after, the, second, world, war, as, a, result, of, the, elimination, of, the, imperialist, view, of, history, it, came, to, be, thought, that, nobunaga, should, be, seen, simply, as, a, military, commander, and, a, politician, this, is, because, the, research, style, had, changed, from, one, based, on, war, tales, such, as, hoan, shinch, ki, to, one, based, on, ancient, documents, gradually, nobunaga, s, progressive, nature, began, to, be, discussed, and, his, image, as, the, favourite, of, the, times, took, root, as, a, result, the, pre, war, image, of, nobunaga, as, an, imperialist, disappeared, and, a, new, image, of, nobunaga, as, a, revolutionary, who, destroyed, the, old, order, and, challenged, established, authority, emerged, however, the, latest, research, perhaps, as, a, reaction, to, this, has, shown, a, marked, tendency, to, believe, that, nobunaga, did, not, uproot, the, existing, system, but, came, to, terms, with, vested, interests, and, promoted, gradual, reforms, and, some, assess, that, he, was, in, fact, a, conservative, daimy, in, recent, years, nobunaga, appears, frequently, in, fiction, and, continues, to, be, portrayed, in, many, different, anime, manga, video, games, and, cinematic, films, very, often, wearing, a, western, style, mustache, and, a, red, european, cape, allegedly, gifted, to, him, however, it, was, after, world, war, ii, that, oda, nobunaga, became, popular, nobunaga, had, previously, appeared, as, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, lord, in, various, taik, ki, in, which, hideyoshi, played, a, leading, role, such, as, ehon, taik, ki, published, in, the, edo, period, and, yoshikawa, eiji, s, historical, novel, shinsho, taik, ki, written, during, world, war, ii, but, in, short, he, was, a, supporting, character, nobunaga, was, often, portrayed, as, a, tyrant, in, variations, of, the, taik, ki, where, his, lack, of, virtue, and, narrow, mindedness, were, often, emphasised, although, his, abilities, were, appreciated, an, exception, is, eiji, yoshikawa, s, taik, ki, in, which, he, was, a, firm, but, benevolent, lord, the, post, war, image, of, nobunaga, began, with, writer, sakaguchi, ango, s, oda, nobunaga, he, described, nobunaga, as, a, rationalist, to, the, bone, nobunaga, first, gained, popularity, in, japan, with, the, hit, film, f, unji, oda, nobunaga, 1959, an, adaptation, of, the, novel, oda, nobunaga, 1955, 60, by, historical, novelist, yamaoka, s, hachi, the, popularity, of, nobunaga, was, determined, by, the, success, of, shiba, ry, tar, s, novel, kunitori, monogatari, 1963, 1966, shiba, positioned, nobunaga, as, a, revolutionary, with, a, clear, will, a, rarity, in, japanese, history, and, established, an, image, of, nobunaga, in, which, light, and, shadow, coexisted, not, only, evaluating, his, innovativeness, but, also, criticising, his, brutality, however, he, was, not, yet, absolutely, popular, at, the, start, of, the, serialisation, and, was, a, double, starring, with, akechi, mitsuhide, on, the, contrary, the, original, protagonist, was, his, father, in, law, saito, d, san, and, nobunaga, was, not, planned, to, appear, however, due, to, its, popularity, shiba, was, not, allowed, to, finish, the, series, and, had, no, choice, but, to, bring, out, nobunaga, and, make, it, a, two, part, series, in, 1973, taiga,
