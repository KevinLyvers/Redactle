rejected, of, qadar, predestination, in, sahih, al, bukhari, by, quoting, a, verse, of, the, qur, an, implying, that, god, had, precisely, determined, all, human, acts, according, to, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, al, bukhari, signified, that, if, someone, was, to, accept, autonomy, in, creating, his, acts, he, would, be, assumed, to, be, playing, god, s, role, and, so, would, subsequently, be, declared, a, mushrik, similar, to, the, later, ash, ari, view, of, kasb, acquisition, occasionalism, and, causality, which, link, human, action, with, divine, omnipotence, in, another, chapter, al,
