gajah, mada, c, 1290, c, 1364, also, known, as, jirnnodhara, was, a, powerful, military, leader, and, mahapatih, of, the, javanese, empire, of, majapahit, during, the, 14th, century, he, is, credited, in, old, javanese, manuscripts, poems, and, inscriptions, with, bringing, the, empire, to, its, peak, of, glory, he, delivered, an, oath, called, sumpah, palapa, in, which, he, vowed, not, to, rest, until, he, had, conquered, all, of, the, southeast, asian, archipelago, of, nusantara, for, majapahit, 363, 364, during, his, reign, the, hindu, epics, including, the, r, m, yana, and, the, mah, bh, rata, became, ingrained, in, the, javanese, culture, and, worldview, through, the, performing, arts, of, wayang, kulit, leather, puppets, he, is, considered, an, important, national, hero, in, modern, indonesia, as, well, as, a, symbol, of, patriotism, and, national, unity, historical, accounts, of, his, life, political, career, and, administration, are, taken, from, several, sources, mainly, the, pararaton, the, book, of, kings, the, nagarakretagama, a, javanese, language, eulogy, and, an, inscription, dating, from, the, mid, 14th, century, much, of, the, modern, popular, depiction, of, gajah, mada, derives, from, the, imagination, of, mohammad, yamin, in, his, 1945, book, gajah, mada, pahlawan, persatuan, nusantara, one, day, in, the, 1940s, yamin, visited, trowulan, the, site, of, the, capital, city, of, the, former, majapahit, kingdom, he, found, fragments, of, terracotta, one, of, which, was, a, piggy, bank, in, the, form, of, the, face, of, a, man, with, a, stocky, face, and, curly, hair, based, on, the, look, on, the, piggy, bank, s, face, yamin, interpreted, this, as, the, face, of, gajah, mada, the, unifier, of, the, archipelago, yamin, then, asked, the, artist, henk, ngantung, to, make, a, painting, based, on, the, terracotta, fragment, the, painting, was, displayed, as, the, cover, of, yamin, s, book, many, people, disagree, with, yamin, s, opinion, because, it, is, impossible, for, the, face, of, a, figure, as, big, as, gajah, mada, to, be, displayed, in, a, piggy, bank, such, a, portrayal, is, considered, an, insult, because, usually, the, state, leaders, during, the, hindu, buddhist, era, including, majapahit, were, made, in, effigy, as, statues, some, even, believe, that, the, face, was, none, other, than, yamin, s, own, face, another, illustration, of, the, historical, gajah, mada, different, from, yamin, s, is, the, result, of, research, at, the, university, of, indonesia, by, archaeologist, agus, aris, munandar, he, interpreted, that, gajah, mada, was, depicted, as, bima, in, wayang, shadow, puppet, shows, with, a, transverse, mustache, in, popular, depiction, gajah, mada, is, mostly, shown, bare, chested, wearing, a, sarong, and, using, a, weapon, in, the, form, of, a, kris, while, this, may, have, been, true, on, civilian, duties, his, official, outfit, might, have, been, different, a, sundanese, patih, explained, in, the, kidung, sundayana, that, gajah, mada, wore, a, gold, embossed, karambalangan, breastplate, and, was, armed, with, a, gold, layered, spear, and, a, shield, full, of, diamond, decoration, according, to, munandar, at, first, gajah, mada, was, depicted, as, a, brajanata, character, from, the, panji, tales, and, as, bima, from, the, mah, bh, rata, in, later, eras, the, panji, story, was, known, earlier, than, the, activities, of, making, bima, statues, which, apparently, began, in, the, mid, 15th, century, so, the, former, was, likely, gajah, mada, s, original, depiction, the, glorification, of, gajah, mada, in, the, first, stage, is, profane, in, the, form, of, its, depiction, as, brajanata, but, then, the, glorification, of, gajah, mada, occurs, in, the, second, stage, which, is, more, sacred, which, is, equated, with, bima, as, an, aspect, of, siva, in, the, statue, found, at, the, national, museum, of, indonesia, no, 5136, 310d, the, statue, is, depicted, with, a, sturdy, body, transverse, mustache, and, wavy, curls, at, the, top, of, the, head, there, is, a, hair, tie, with, a, ribbon, forming, like, a, tekes, hat, he, wears, clothes, and, jewelry, bracelets, and, an, upper, armband, in, the, form, of, a, snake, like, bima, s, the, traditional, bima, statue, depiction, associated, with, gajah, mada, was, made, at, the, end, of, majapahit, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, characteristics, are, a, wearing, a, supit, urang, crown, his, hair, is, shaped, in, two, arches, at, the, top, of, the, head, like, a, shrimp, tongs, b, a, transverse, mustache, c, strong, body, d, wearing, poleng, black, and, white, cloth, and, e, the, phallus, is, always, depicted, standing, out, in, the, bima, statue, stored, in, the, national, museum, no, 2776, 286b, he, is, depicted, standing, upright, with, both, hands, beside, his, body, his, right, hand, holding, a, gadha, a, kind, of, mace, his, phallus, is, depicted, as, protruding, with, a, shawl, hanging, between, his, legs, he, is, wearing, a, serpent, upavita, a, crown, of, supit, urang, a, grim, face, and, a, thick, transverse, mustache, and, the, hair, above, the, forehead, is, described, as, curly, forming, a, jamang, forehead, decoration, the, similarity, between, the, statue, of, brajanata, as, the, embodiment, of, gajah, mada, and, the, statue, of, bima, is, not, a, coincidence, but, there, is, an, underlying, conception, that, is, developed, along, with, the, distance, between, historical, events, and, their, worshippers, at, a, later, time, the, word, gajah, elephant, refers, to, a, large, animal, that, is, respected, by, other, animals, in, hindu, mythology, it, is, believed, to, be, a, vahana, animal, mount, of, the, god, indra, elephants, are, also, associated, with, ganesha, the, elephant, headed, god, with, a, human, body, the, son, of, shiva, and, parvati, as, for, the, word, mada, in, the, ancient, javanese, language, possibly, derived, from, sanskrit, where, the, word, has, the, same, meaning, it, means, drunk, when, an, elephant, is, drunk, he, will, walk, arbitrarily, and, violently, overcoming, all, obstacles, so, when, it, is, associated, with, the, figure, of, gajah, mada, the, name, can, be, interpreted, in, two, ways, namely, in, the, gajah, mada, inscription, another, nickname, was, used, namely, rakryan, mapatih, jirnnodhara, it, is, possible, the, name, is, just, a, title, for, gajah, mada, but, it, can, also, be, seen, as, the, official, name, the, meaning, of, the, word, jirnnodhara, is, builder, of, something, new, or, restorer, of, something, that, has, fallen, apart, in, a, literal, sense, gajah, mada, is, the, builder, of, caitya, for, kertanegara, which, did, not, exist, before, in, a, figurative, sense, he, can, be, seen, as, a, restorer, and, successor, to, kertanegara, s, ideas, in, the, dwipantara, mandala, concept, not, much, is, known, about, gajah, mada, s, early, life, but, he, was, born, into, an, ordinary, family, early, accounts, mention, his, career, as, a, commander, of, the, bhayangkara, an, elite, royal, guard, for, the, majapahit, king, and, royal, family, when, rakrian, kuti, an, official, from, majapahit, rebelled, against, king, jayanegara, r, 1309, 1328, in, 1321, gajah, mada, and, the, mahapatih, arya, tadah, rescued, the, king, and, his, family, by, escaping, from, the, capital, city, of, trowulan, later, gajah, mada, helped, the, king, return, to, the, capital, and, crush, the, rebellion, seven, years, later, jayanegara, was, murdered, by, the, court, physician, rakrian, tanca, an, aide, of, rakrian, kuti, another, version, suggests, that, jayanegara, was, assassinated, by, gajah, mada, in, 1328, jayanegara, was, overly, protective, of, his, two, half, sisters, born, from, kertarajasa, s, youngest, queen, dyah, dewi, gayatri, complaints, by, the, two, young, princesses, led, to, the, intervention, of, gajah, mada, his, solution, was, to, arrange, for, a, surgeon, to, murder, the, king, while, pretending, to, perform, surgery, jayanegara, was, immediately, succeeded, by, his, half, sister, tribhuwana, wijayatunggadewi, r, 1328, 1350, however, when, she, took, the, throne, the, sadeng, and, keta, region, did, not, send, their, delegations, which, was, interpreted, as, a, rebellion, this, was, later, confirmed, when, tribhuwana, s, spies, discovered, that, both, regions, were, preparing, for, rebellions, sadeng, and, keta, were, coastal, regions, who, were, formerly, conquered, by, majapahit, however, the, death, of, nambi, in, 1316, a, local, patih, who, was, deemed, instrumental, in, raising, both, regions, also, contributed, to, the, rebellion, at, this, time, sadeng, was, also, led, by, a, famed, majapahit, general, wirota, wiraganti, while, gajah, mada, was, still, currently, a, patih, he, was, sent, by, tribhuwana, with, the, advice, of, the, sickly, mahapatih, arya, tadah, to, negotiate, with, rebel, leaders, in, 1331, however, the, majapahit, general, ra, kembar, a, rival, of, gajah, mada, preceded, his, arrival, with, his, army, to, crush, both, rebellions, his, men, jabung, tarewes, lembu, peteng, dan, ikal, ikalan, bang, were, also, the, ones, implicated, in, the, murder, of, nambi, this, led, to, a, conflict, between, gajah, mada, s, and, ra, kembar, s, forces, which, was, only, resolved, when, tribhuwana, herself, led, the, battles, against, both, rebelling, regions, after, arya, tadah, s, retirement, gajah, mada, was, picked, as, mahapatih, in, 1334, it, was, during, gajah, mada, s, reign, as, mahapatih, around, the, year, 1345, that, the, famous, muslim, traveller, ibn, battuta, visited, sumatra, it, is, said, that, it, was, during, his, appointment, as, mahapatih, under, queen,

thought, that, the, royal, marriage, was, a, sign, of, a, new, alliance, between, sunda, and, majapahit, gajah, mada, thought, otherwise, he, stated, that, the, princess, of, sunda, was, not, to, be, hailed, as, the, new, queen, consort, of, majapahit, but, merely, as, a, concubine, as, a, sign, of, submission, of, sunda, to, majapahit, this, misunderstanding, led, to, embarrassment, and,
