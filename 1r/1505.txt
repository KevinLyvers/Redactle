foreign, markets, particularly, yemen, and, abyssinia, ethiopia, and, developed, a, reputation, among, the, quraysh, for, their, intellect, nobility, and, wealth, their, prominence, was, owed, to, the, leadership, of, khalid, s, paternal, grandfather, al, mughira, ibn, abd, allah, khalid, s, paternal, uncle, hisham, was, known, as, the, lord, of, mecca, and, the, date, of, his, death, was,

muhammad, at, the, battle, of, uhud, north, of, medina, according, to, the, historian, donald, routledge, hill, rather, than, launching, a, frontal, assault, against, the, muslim, lines, on, the, slopes, of, mount, uhud, khalid, adopted, the, sound, tactics, of, going, around, the, mountain, and, bypassing, the, muslim, flank, he, advanced, through, the, wadi, qanat, valley, west, of, uhud, until, being, checked, by, muslim, archers, south, of, the, valley, at, mount, ruma, the, muslims, gained, the, early, advantage, in, the, fight, but, after, most, of, the, muslim, archers, abandoned, their, positions, to, join, the, raiding, of, the, meccans, camp, khalid, charged, against, the, resulting, break, in, the, muslims, rear, defensive, lines, in, the, ensuing, rout, several, dozen, muslims, were, killed, the, narratives, of, the, battle, describe, khalid, riding, through, the, field, slaying, the, muslims, with, his, lance, shaban, credits, khalid, s, military, genius, for, the, quraysh, s, victory, at, uhud, the, only, engagement, in, which, the, tribe, defeated, muhammad, in, 628, muhammad, and, his, followers, headed, for, mecca, to, perform, the, umra, lesser, pilgrimage, to, mecca, and, the, quraysh, dispatched, 200, cavalry, to, intercept, him, upon, hearing, of, his, departure, khalid, was, at, the, head, of, the, cavalry, and, muhammad, avoided, confronting, him, by, taking, an, unconventional, and, difficult, alternate, route, ultimately, reaching, hudaybiyya, at, the, edge, of, mecca, upon, realizing, muhammad, s, change, of, course, khalid, withdrew, to, mecca, a, truce, between, the, muslims, and, the, quraysh, was, reached, in, the, treaty, of, hudaybiyya, in, march, ridda, wars, conquest, of, sasanian, persia, conquest, of, byzantine, syria, campaigns, in, africa, campaigns, in, armenia, and, anatolia, in, the, year, 6, ah, c, 627, or, 8, ah, c, 629, khalid, embraced, islam, in, muhammad, s, presence, alongside, the, qurayshite, amr, ibn, al, as, the, modern, historian, michael, lecker, comments, that, the, accounts, holding, that, khalid, and, amr, converted, in, 8, ah, are, perhaps, more, trustworthy, the, historian, akram, diya, umari, holds, that, khalid, and, amr, embraced, islam, and, relocated, to, medina, following, the, treaty, of, hudaybiyya, apparently, after, the, quraysh, dropped, demands, for, the, extradition, of, newer, muslim, converts, to, mecca, following, his, conversion, khalid, began, to, devote, all, his, considerable, military, talents, to, the, support, of, the, new, muslim, state, according, to, the, historian, hugh, n, kennedy, khalid, participated, in, the, expedition, to, mu, ta, in, modern, day, jordan, ordered, by, muhammad, in, september, 629, the, purpose, of, the, raid, may, have, been, to, acquire, booty, in, the, wake, of, the, sasanian, persian, army, s, retreat, from, syria, following, its, defeat, by, the, byzantine, empire, in, july, the, muslim, detachment, was, routed, by, a, byzantine, force, consisting, mostly, of, arab, tribesmen, led, by, the, byzantine, commander, theodore, and, several, high, ranking, muslim, commanders, were, slain, khalid, took, command, of, the, army, following, the, deaths, of, the, appointed, commanders, and, with, considerable, difficulty, oversaw, a, safe, withdrawal, of, the, muslims, muhammad, rewarded, khalid, by, bestowing, on, him, the, honorary, title, sayf, allah, the, sword, of, god, in, december, 629, or, january, 630, khalid, took, part, in, muhammad, s, capture, of, mecca, after, which, most, of, the, quraysh, converted, to, islam, in, that, engagement, khalid, led, a, nomadic, contingent, called, muhajirat, al, arab, the, bedouin, emigrants, he, led, one, of, the, two, main, pushes, into, the, city, and, in, the, subsequent, fighting, with, the, quraysh, three, of, his, men, were, killed, while, twelve, qurayshites, were, slain, according, to, ibn, ishaq, the, 8th, century, biographer, of, muhammad, khalid, commanded, the, bedouin, banu, sulaym, in, the, muslims, vanguard, at, the, battle, of, hunayn, later, that, year, in, that, confrontation, the, muslims, boosted, by, the, influx, of, qurayshite, converts, defeated, the, thaqif, the, ta, if, based, traditional, rivals, of, the, quraysh, and, their, nomadic, hawazin, allies, khalid, was, then, appointed, to, destroy, the, idol, of, al, uzza, one, of, the, goddesses, worshiped, in, pre, islamic, arabian, religion, in, the, nakhla, area, between, mecca, and, ta, if, khalid, was, afterward, dispatched, to, invite, to, islam, the, banu, jadhima, in, yalamlam, about, 80, kilometers, 50, mi, south, of, mecca, but, the, islamic, traditional, sources, hold, that, he, attacked, the, tribe, illicitly, in, the, version, of, ibn, ishaq, khalid, had, persuaded, the, jadhima, tribesmen, to, disarm, and, embrace, islam, which, he, followed, up, by, executing, a, number, of, the, tribesmen, in, revenge, for, the, jadhima, s, slaying, of, his, uncle, fakih, ibn, al, mughira, dating, to, before, khalid, s, conversion, to, islam, in, the, narrative, of, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, d, 1449, khalid, misunderstood, the, tribesmen, s, acceptance, of, the, faith, as, a, rejection, or, denigration, of, islam, due, to, his, unfamiliarity, with, the, jadhima, s, accent, and, consequently, attacked, them, in, both, versions, muhammad, declared, himself, innocent, of, khalid, s, action, but, did, not, discharge, or, punish, him, according, to, the, historian, w, montgomery, watt, the, traditional, account, about, the, jadhima, incident, is, hardly, more, than, a, circumstantial, denigration, of, kh, lid, and, yields, little, solid, historical, fact, later, in, 630, while, muhammad, was, at, tabuk, he, dispatched, khalid, to, capture, the, oasis, market, town, of, dumat, al, jandal, khalid, gained, its, surrender, and, imposed, a, heavy, penalty, on, the, inhabitants, of, the, town, one, of, whose, chiefs, the, kindite, ukaydir, ibn, abd, al, malik, al, sakuni, was, ordered, by, khalid, to, sign, the, capitulation, treaty, with, muhammad, in, medina, in, june, 631, khalid, was, sent, by, muhammad, at, the, head, of, 480, men, to, invite, the, mixed, christian, and, polytheistic, balharith, tribe, of, najran, to, embrace, islam, the, tribe, converted, and, khalid, instructed, them, in, the, qur, an, and, islamic, laws, before, returning, to, muhammad, in, medina, with, a, balharith, delegation, after, muhammad, s, death, in, june, 632, one, of, his, early, and, close, companions, abu, bakr, became, caliph, leader, of, the, muslim, community, the, issue, of, succession, had, caused, discord, among, the, muslims, the, ansar, lit, helpers, the, natives, of, medina, who, hosted, muhammad, after, his, emigration, from, mecca, attempted, to, elect, their, own, leader, opinion, was, split, among, the, muhajirun, lit, emigrants, the, mostly, qurayshite, natives, of, mecca, who, emigrated, with, muhammad, to, medina, one, group, advocated, for, a, companion, closer, in, kinship, to, muhammad, namely, his, cousin, ali, while, another, group, backed, by, new, converts, among, the, qurayshite, aristocracy, rallied, behind, abu, bakr, the, latter, with, the, key, intervention, of, the, prominent, muhajirun, umar, ibn, al, khattab, and, abu, ubayda, ibn, al, jarrah, overrode, the, ansar, and, acceded, khalid, was, a, staunch, supporter, of, abu, bakr, s, succession, a, report, preserved, in, a, work, by, the, 13th, century, scholar, ibn, abi, l, hadid, claims, that, khalid, was, a, partisan, of, abu, bakr, opposed, ali, s, candidacy, and, declared, that, abu, bakr, was, not, a, man, about, whom, one, needs, enquire, and, his, character, needs, not, be, sounded, out, most, tribes, in, arabia, except, those, inhabiting, the, environs, of, mecca, medina, and, ta, if, discontinued, their, allegiance, to, the, nascent, muslim, state, after, muhammad, s, death, or, had, never, established, formal, relations, with, medina, islamic, historiography, describes, abu, bakr, s, efforts, to, establish, or, reestablish, islamic, rule, over, the, tribes, as, the, ridda, wars, wars, against, the, apostates, views, of, the, wars, by, modern, historians, vary, considerably, watt, agrees, with, the, islamic, characterization, of, the, tribal, opposition, as, anti, islamic, in, nature, while, julius, wellhausen, and, c, h, becker, hold, the, tribes, were, opposed, to, the, tax, obligations, to, medina, rather, than, islam, as, a, religion, in, the, view, of, leone, caetani, and, bernard, lewis, the, opposing, tribes, who, had, established, ties, with, medina, regarded, their, religious, and, fiscal, obligations, as, being, a, personal, contract, with, muhammad, their, attempts, to, negotiate, different, terms, after, his, death, were, rejected, by, abu, bakr, who, proceeded, to, launch, the, campaigns, against, them, of, the, six, main, conflict, zones, in, arabia, during, the, ridda, wars, two, were, centered, in, najd, the, central, arabian, plateau, the, rebellion, of, the, asad, tayy, and, ghatafan, tribes, under, tulayha, and, the, rebellion, of, the, tamim, tribe, led, by, sajah, both, leaders, claimed, to, be, prophets, after, abu, bakr, quashed, the, threat, to, medina, by, the, ghatafan, at, the, battle, of, dhu, al, qassa, he, dispatched, khalid, against, the, rebel, tribes, in, najd, khalid, was, abu, bakr, s, third, nominee, to, lead, the, campaign, after, his, first, two, choices, zayd, ibn, al, khattab, and, abu, hudhayfa, ibn, utba, refused, the, assignment, his, forces, were, drawn, from, the, muhajirun, and, the, ansar, throughout, the, campaign, khalid, demonstrated, considerable, operational, independence, and, did, not, stringently, abide, by, the, caliph, s, directives, in, the, words, of, shaban, he, simply, defeated, whoever, was, there, to, be, defeated, khalid, s, initial, focus, was, the, suppression, of, tulayha, s, following, in, late, 632, he, confronted, tulayha, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, buzakha, which, took, place, at, the, eponymous, well, in, asad, territory, where, the, tribes, were, encamped, the, tayy, defected, to, the, muslims, before, khalid, s, troops, arrived, to, buzakha, the, result, of, mediation, between, the, two, sides, by, the, tayy, chief, adi, ibn, hatim, the, latter, had, been, assigned, by, medina, as, its, tax, collector, over, his, tribe, and, its, traditional, asad, rivals, khalid, bested, the, asad, ghatafan, forces, in, battle, when, tulayha, appeared, close, to, defeat, the, fazara, section, of, the, ghatafan, under, their, chief, uyayna, ibn, hisn, deserted, the, field, compelling, tulayha, to, flee, for, syria, his, tribe, the, asad, subsequently, submitted, to, khalid, followed, by, the, hitherto, neutral, banu, amir, which, had, awaited, the, results, of, the, conflict, before, giving, its, allegiance, to, either, side, uyayna, was, captured, and, brought, to, medina, as, a, result, of, the, victory, at, buzakha, the, muslims, gained, control, over, most, of, najd, after, buzakha, khalid, proceeded, against, the, rebel, tamimite, chieftain, malik, ibn, nuwayra, headquartered, in, al, butah, in, the, present, day, qassim, region, malik, had, been, appointed, by, muhammad, as, the, collector, of, the, sadaqa, alms, tax, over, his, clan, of, the, tamim, the, yarbu, but, stopped, forwarding, this, tax, to, medina, after, muhammad, s, death, abu, bakr, consequently, resolved, to, have, him, executed, by, khalid, the, latter, faced, divisions, within, his, army, regarding, this, campaign, with, the, ansar, initially, staying, behind, citing, instructions, by, abu, bakr, not, to, campaign, further, until, receiving, a, direct, order, by, the, caliph, khalid, claimed, such, an, order, was, his, prerogative, as, the, commander, appointed, by, the, caliph, but, he, did, not, force, the, ansar, to, participate, and, continued, his, march, with, troops, from, the, muhajirun, and, the, bedouin, defectors, from, buzakha, and, its, aftermath, the, ansar, ultimately, rejoined, khalid, after, internal, deliberations, according, to, the, most, common, account, in, the, muslim, traditional, sources, khalid, s, army, encountered, malik, and, eleven, of, his, clansmen, from, the, yarbu, in, 632, the, yarbu, did, not, resist, proclaimed, their, muslim, faith, and, were, escorted, to, khalid, s, camp, khalid, had, them, all, executed, over, the, objection, of, an, ansarite, who, had, been, among, the, captors, of, the, tribesmen, and, argued, for, the, captives, inviolability, due, to, their, testaments, as, muslims, afterward, khalid, married, malik, s, widow, umm, tamim, bint, al, minhal, when, news, of, khalid, s, actions, reached, medina, umar, who, had, become, abu, bakr, s, chief, aide, pressed, for, khalid, to, be, punished, or, relieved, of, command, but, abu, bakr, pardoned, him, according, to, the, account, of, the, 8th, century, historian, sayf, ibn, umar, malik, had, also, been, cooperating, with, the, prophetess, sajah, his, kinswoman, from, the, yarbu, but, after, they, were, defeated, by, rival, clans, from, the, tamim, left, her, cause, and, retreated, to, his, camp, at, al, butah, there, he, was, encountered, with, his, small, party, by, the, muslims, the, modern, historian, wilferd, madelung, discounts, sayf, s, version, asserting, that, umar, and, other, muslims, would, not, have, protested, khalid, s, execution, of, malik, if, the, latter, had, left, islam, while, watt, considers, accounts, about, the, tamim, during, the, ridda, in, general, to, be, obscure, partly, because, the, enemies, of, kh, lid, b, al, wal, d, have, twisted, the, stories, to, blacken, him, in, the, view, of, the, modern, historian, ella, landau, tasseron, the, truth, behind, malik, s, career, and, death, will, remain, buried, under, a, heap, of, conflicting, traditions, following, a, series, of, setbacks, in, her, conflict, with, rival, tamim, factions, sajah, joined, the, strongest, opponent, of, the, muslims, musaylima, the, leader, of, the, sedentary, banu, hanifa, tribe, in, the, yamama, the, agricultural, eastern, borderlands, of, najd, musaylima, had, laid, claims, to, prophet, hood, before, muhammad, s, emigration, from, mecca, and, his,

value, lay, not, only, with, its, abundance, of, wheat, fields, and, date, palms, but, also, its, location, connecting, medina, to, the, regions, of, bahrayn, and, oman, in, eastern, arabia, abu, bakr, had, dispatched, shurahbil, ibn, hasana, and, khalid, s, cousin, ikrima, with, an, army, to, reinforce, the, muslim, governor, in, the, yamama, musaylima, s, tribal, kinsman, thumama, ibn, uthal, according, to, the, modern, historian, meir, jacob, kister, it, was, likely, the, threat, posed, by, this, army, which, compelled, musaylima, to, forge, an, alliance, with, sajah, ikrima, was, repelled, by, musaylima, s, forces, and, thereafter, instructed, by, abu, bakr, to, quell, rebellions, in, oman, and, mahra, central, southern, arabia, while, shurahbil, was, to, remain, in, the, yamama, in, expectation, of, khalid, s, large, army, after, his, victories, against, the, bedouin, of, najd, khalid, headed, to, the, yamama, with, warnings, of, the, hanifa, s, military, prowess, and, instructions, by, abu, bakr, to, act, severely, toward, the, tribe, should, he, be, victorious, the, 12th, century, historian, ibn, hubaysh, al, asadi, holds, that, the, armies, of, khalid, and, musaylima, respectively, stood, at, 4, 500, and, 4, 000, kister, dismisses, the, much, larger, figures, cited, by, most, of, the, early, muslim, sources, as, exaggerations, khalid, s, first, three, assaults, against, musaylima, at, the, plain, of, aqraba, were, beaten, back, the, strength, of, musaylima, s, warriors, the, superiority, of, their, swords, and, the, fickleness, of, the, bedouin, contingents, in, khalid, s, ranks, were, all, reasons, cited, by, the, muslims, for, their, initial, failures, khalid, heeded, the, counsel, of, the, ansarite, thabit, ibn, qays, to, exclude, the, bedouins, from, the, next, fight, in, the, fourth, assault, against, the, hanifa, the, muhajirun, under, khalid, and, the, ansar, under, thabit, killed, a, lieutenant, of, musaylima, who, subsequently, fled, with, part, of, his, army, the, muslims, pursued, the, hanifa, to, a, large, enclosed, garden, which, musaylima, used, to, stage, a, last, stand, against, the, muslims, the, enclosure, was, stormed, by, the, muslims, musaylima, was, slain, and, most, of, the, hanifites, were, killed, or, wounded, the, enclosure, became, known, as, the, garden, of, death, for, the, high, casualties, suffered, by, both, sides, khalid, assigned, a, hanifite, taken, captive, early, in, the, campaign, mujja, a, ibn, al, murara, to, assess, the, strength, morale, and, intentions, of, the, hanifa, in, their, yamama, fortresses, in, the, aftermath, of, musaylima, s, slaying, mujja, a, had, the, women, and, children, of, the, tribe, dress, and, pose, as, men, at, the, openings, of, the, forts, in, a, ruse, to, boost, their, leverage, with, khalid, he, relayed, to, khalid, that, the, hanifa, still, counted, numerous, warriors, determined, to, continue, the, fight, against, the, muslims, this, assessment, along, with, the, exhaustion, of, his, own, troops, compelled, khalid, to, accept, mujja, a, s, counsel, for, a, ceasefire, with, the, hanifa, despite, abu, bakr, s, directives, to, pursue, retreating, hanifites, and, execute, hanifite, prisoners, of, war, khalid, s, terms, with, the, hanifa, entailed, the, tribe, s, conversion, to, islam, and, the, surrender, of, their, arms, and, armor, and, stockpiles, of, gold, and, silver, abu, bakr, ratified, the, treaty, though, he, remained, opposed, to, khalid, s, concessions, and, warned, that, the, hanifa, would, remain, eternally, faithful, to, musaylima, the, treaty, was, further, consecrated, by, khalid, s, marriage, to, mujja, a, s, daughter, according, to, lecker, mujja, a, s, ruse, may, have, been, invented, by, the, islamic, tradition, in, order, to, protect, khalid, s, policy, because, the, negotiated, treaty, caused, the, muslims, great, losses, khalid, was, allotted, an, orchard, and, a, field, in, each, village, included, in, the, treaty, with, the, hanifa, while, the, villages, excluded, from, the, treaty, were, subject, to, punitive, measures, among, these, villages, were, musaylima, s, hometown, al, haddar, and, mar, at, whose, inhabitants, were, expelled, or, enslaved, and, the, villages, resettled, with, tribesmen, from, clans, of, the, tamim, the, traditional, sources, place, the, final, suppression, of, the, arab, tribes, of, the, ridda, wars, before, march, 633, though, caetani, insists, the, campaigns, must, have, continued, into, 634, the, tribes, in, bahrayn, may, have, resisted, the, muslims, until, the, middle, of, 634, a, number, of, the, early, islamic, sources, ascribe, a, role, for, khalid, on, the, bahrayn, front, after, his, victory, over, the, hanifa, shoufani, deems, this, improbable, while, allowing, the, possibility, that, khalid, had, earlier, sent, detachments, from, his, army, to, reinforce, the, main, muslim, commander, in, bahrayn, al, ala, al, hadhrami, the, muslim, war, efforts, in, which, khalid, played, a, vital, part, secured, medina, s, dominance, over, the, strong, tribes, of, arabia, which, sought, to, diminish, islamic, authority, in, the, peninsula, and, restored, the, nascent, muslim, state, s, prestige, according, to, lecker, khalid, and, the, other, qurayshite, generals, gained, precious, experience, in, mobilizing, large, multi, tribal, armies, over, long, distances, and, benefited, from, the, close, acquaintance, of, the, kuraysh, with, tribal, politics, throughout, arabia, with, the, yamama, pacified, khalid, marched, northward, toward, sasanian, territory, in, iraq, lower, mesopotamia, he, reorganized, his, army, possibly, because, the, bulk, of, the, muhajirun, may, have, withdrawn, to, medina, according, to, the, historian, khalil, athamina, the, remnants, of, khalid, s, army, consisted, of, nomadic, arabs, from, medina, s, environs, whose, chiefs, were, appointed, to, replace, the, vacant, command, posts, left, by, the, sahaba, companions, of, muhammad, the, historian, fred, donner, holds, that, the, muhajirun, and, the, ansar, still, formed, the, core, of, his, army, along, with, a, large, proportion, of, nomadic, arabs, likely, from, the, muzayna, tayy, tamim, asad, and, ghatafan, tribes, the, commanders, of, the, tribal, contingents, appointed, by, khalid, were, adi, ibn, hatim, of, the, tayy, and, asim, ibn, amr, of, the, tamim, he, arrived, at, the, southern, iraqi, frontier, with, about, 1, 000, warriors, in, the, late, spring, or, early, summer, of, 633, the, focus, of, khalid, s, offensive, was, the, western, banks, of, the, euphrates, river, and, the, nomadic, arabs, who, dwelt, there, the, details, of, the, campaign, s, itinerary, are, inconsistent, in, the, early, muslim, sources, though, donner, asserts, that, the, general, course, of, khalid, s, progress, in, the, first, part, of, his, campaigning, in, iraq, can, be, quite, clearly, traced, the, 9th, century, histories, of, al, baladhuri, and, khalifa, ibn, khayyat, hold, khalid, s, first, major, battle, in, iraq, was, his, victory, over, the, sasanian, garrison, at, ubulla, the, ancient, apologos, near, modern, basra, and, the, nearby, village, of, khurayba, though, al, tabari, d, 923, considers, attribution, of, the, victory, to, khalid, as, erroneous, and, that, ubulla, was, conquered, later, by, utba, ibn, ghazwan, al, mazini, donner, accepts, the, town, s, conquest, by, utba, somewhat, later, than, 634, is, the, more, likely, scenario, though, the, historian, khalid, yahya, blankinship, argues, kh, lid, at, least, may, have, led, a, raid, there, although, actually, reduced, the, area, from, ubulla, s, vicinity, khalid, marched, up, the, western, bank, of, the, euphrates, where, he, clashed, with, the, small, sasanian, garrisons, who, guarded, the, iraqi, frontier, from, nomadic, incursions, the, clashes, occurred, at, dhat, al, salasil, nahr, al, mar, a, a, canal, connecting, the, euphrates, with, the, tigris, immediately, north, of, ubulla, madhar, a, town, several, days, north, of, ubulla, ullays, likely, the, ancient, trade, center, of, vologesias, and, walaja, the, last, two, places, were, in, the, vicinity, of, al, hira, a, predominantly, arab, market, town, and, the, sasanian, administrative, center, for, the, middle, euphrates, valley, al, hira, s, capture, was, the, most, significant, gain, of, khalid, s, campaign, after, besting, the, city, s, persian, cavalry, under, the, commander, azadhbih, in, minor, clashes, khalid, and, part, of, his, army, entered, the, unwalled, city, al, hira, s, arab, tribal, nobles, many, of, whom, were, nestorian, christians, with, blood, ties, to, the, nomadic, tribes, on, the, city, s, western, desert, fringes, barricaded, in, their, scattered, fortified, palaces, in, the, meantime, the, other, part, of, khalid, s, army, harried, the, villages, in, al, hira, s, orbit, many, of, which, were, captured, or, capitulated, on, tributary, terms, with, the, muslims, the, arab, nobility, of, al, hira, surrendered, in, an, agreement, with, khalid, whereby, the, city, paid, a, tribute, in, return, for, assurances, that, al, hira, s, churches, and, palaces, would, not, be, disturbed, the, annual, sum, to, be, paid, by, al, hira, amounted, to, 60, 000, or, 90, 000, silver, dirhams, which, khalid, forwarded, to, medina, marking, the, first, tribute, the, caliphate, received, from, iraq, during, the, engagements, in, and, around, al, hira, khalid, received, key, assistance, from, al, muthanna, ibn, haritha, and, his, shayban, tribe, who, had, been, raiding, this, frontier, for, a, considerable, period, before, khalid, s, arrival, though, it, is, not, clear, if, al, muthanna, s, earlier, activities, were, linked, to, the, nascent, muslim, state, after, khalid, departed, he, left, al, muthanna, in, practical, control, of, al, hira, and, its, vicinity, he, received, similar, assistance, from, the, sadus, clan, of, the, dhuhl, tribe, under, qutba, ibn, qatada, and, the, ijl, tribe, under, al, madh, ur, ibn, adi, during, the, engagements, at, ubulla, and, walaja, none, of, these, tribes, all, of, which, were, branches, of, the, banu, bakr, confederation, joined, khalid, when, he, operated, outside, of, their, tribal, areas, khalid, continued, northward, along, the, euphrates, valley, attacking, anbar, on, the, east, bank, of, the, river, where, he, secured, capitulation, terms, from, its, sasanian, commander, afterward, he, plundered, the, surrounding, market, villages, frequented, by, tribesmen, from, the, bakr, and, quda, a, confederations, before, moving, against, ayn, al, tamr, an, oasis, town, west, of, the, euphrates, and, about, 90, kilometers, 56, mi, south, of, anbar, khalid, encountered, stiff, resistance, there, by, the, tribesmen, of, the, namir, compelling, him, to, besiege, the, town, s, fortress, the, namir, were, led, by, hilal, ibn, aqqa, a, christian, chieftain, allied, with, the, sasanians, who, khalid, had, crucified, after, defeating, him, ayn, al, tamr, capitulated, and, khalid, captured, the, town, of, sandawda, to, the, north, by, this, stage, khalid, had, subjugated, the, western, areas, of, the, lower, euphrates, and, the, nomadic, tribes, including, the, namir, taghlib, iyad, taymallat, and, most, of, the, ijl, as, well, as, the, settled, arab, tribesmen, which, resided, there, athamina, doubts, the, islamic, traditional, narrative, that, abu, bakr, directed, khalid, to, launch, a, campaign, in, iraq, citing, abu, bakr, s, disinterest, in, iraq, at, a, time, when, the, muslim, state, s, energies, were, focused, principally, on, the, conquest, of, syria, unlike, syria, iraq, had, not, been, the, focus, of, muhammad, s, or, the, early, muslims, ambitions, nor, did, the, quraysh, maintain, trading, interests, in, the, region, dating, to, the, pre, islamic, period, as, they, had, in, syria, according, to, shaban, it, is, unclear, if, khalid, requested, or, received, abu, bakr, s, sanction, to, raid, iraq, or, ignored, objections, by, the, caliph, athamina, notes, hints, in, the, traditional, sources, that, khalid, initiated, the, campaign, unilaterally, implying, that, the, return, of, the, muhajirun, in, khalid, s, ranks, to, medina, following, musaylima, s, defeat, likely, represented, their, protest, of, khalid, s, ambitions, in, iraq, shaban, holds, that, the, tribesmen, who, remained, in, khalid, s, army, were, motivated, by, the, prospect, of, war, booty, particularly, amid, an, economic, crisis, in, arabia, which, had, arisen, in, the, aftermath, of, the, ridda, campaigns, according, to, fred, donner, the, subjugation, of, arab, tribes, may, have, been, khalid, s, primary, goal, in, iraq, and, clashes, with, persian, troops, were, the, inevitable, if, incidental, result, of, the, tribes, alignment, with, the, sasanian, empire, in, kennedy, s, view, khalid, s, push, toward, the, desert, frontier, of, iraq, was, a, natural, continuation, of, his, work, subduing, the, tribes, of, northeastern, arabia, and, in, line, with, medina, s, policy, to, bring, all, nomadic, arab, tribes, under, its, authority, madelung, asserts, abu, bakr, relied, on, the, qurayshite, aristocracy, during, the, ridda, wars, and, early, muslim, conquests, and, speculates, that, the, caliph, dispatched, khalid, to, iraq, to, allot, the, makhzum, an, interest, in, that, region, the, extent, of, khalid, s, role, in, the, conquest, of, iraq, is, disputed, by, modern, historians, patricia, crone, argues, it, is, unlikely, khalid, played, any, role, on, the, iraqi, front, citing, seeming, contradictions, by, contemporary, non, arabic, sources, namely, the, armenian, chronicle, of, sebeos, c, 661, and, the, khuzistan, chronicle, c, 680, the, former, only, records, arab, armies, being, sent, to, conquer, iraq, as, the, muslim, conquest, of, syria, was, already, underway, as, opposed, to, before, as, held, by, the, traditional, islamic, sources, while, the, latter, mentions, khalid, as, the, conqueror, of, syria, only, crone, views, the, traditional, reports, as, part, of, a, general, theme, in, the, largely, iraq, based, abbasid, era, post, 750, sources, to, diminish, the, early, muslims, focus, on, syria, in, favor, of, iraq, crone, s, assessment, is, considered, a, radical, critique, of, the, sources, by, r, stephen, humphreys, while, khalid, yahya, blankinship, calls, it, too, one, sided, the, fact, that, kh, lid, is, a, major, hero, in, the, historical, traditions, of, iraq, certainly, suggests, ties, there, that, can, have, come, only, from, his, early, participation, in, its, conquest, all, early, islamic, accounts, agree, that, khalid, was, ordered, by, abu, bakr, to, leave, iraq, for, syria, to, support, muslim, forces, already, present, there, most, of, these, accounts, hold, that, the, caliph, s, order, was, prompted, by, requests, for, reinforcements, by, the, muslim, commanders, in, syria, khalid, likely, began, his, march, to, syria, in, early, april, 634, he, left, small, muslim, garrisons, in, the, conquered, cities, of, iraq, under, the, overall, military, command, of, al, muthanna, ibn, haritha, the, chronological, sequence, of, events, after, khalid, s, operations, in, ayn, al, tamr, is, inconsistent, and, confused, according, to, donner, khalid, undertook, two, further, principal, operations, before, embarking, on, his, march, to, syria, which, have, often, been, conflated, by, the, sources, with, events, that, occurred, during, the, march, one, of, the, operations, was, against, dumat, al, jandal, and, the, other, against, the, namir, and, taghlib, tribes, present, along, the, western, banks, of, the, upper, euphrates, valley, as, far, as, the, balikh, tributary, and, the, jabal, al, bishri, mountains, northeast, of, palmyra, it, is, unclear, which, engagement, occurred, first, though, both, were, muslim, efforts, to, bring, the, mostly, nomadic, arab, tribes, of, north, arabia, and, the, syrian, steppe, under, medina, s, control, in, the, dumat, al, jandal, campaign, khalid, was, instructed, by, abu, bakr, or, requested, by, one, of, the, commanders, of, the, campaign, al, walid, ibn, uqba, to, reinforce, the, lead, commander, iyad, ibn, ghanm, s, faltering, siege, of, the, oasis, town, its, defenders, were, backed, by, their, nomadic, allies, from, the, byzantine, confederate, tribes, the, ghassanids, tanukhids, salihids, bahra, and, banu, kalb, khalid, left, ayn, al, tamr, for, dumat, al, jandal, where, the, combined, muslim, forces, bested, the, defenders, in, a, pitched, battle, afterward, khalid, executed, the, town, s, kindite, leader, ukaydir, who, had, defected, from, medina, following, muhammad, s, death, while, the, kalbite, chief, wadi, a, was, spared, after, the, intercession, of, his, tamimite, allies, in, the, muslims, camp, the, historians, michael, jan, de, goeje, and, caetani, dismiss, altogether, that, khalid, led, an, expedition, to, dumat, al, jandal, following, his, iraqi, campaign, and, that, the, city, mentioned, in, the, traditional, sources, was, likely, the, town, by, the, same, name, near, al, hira, the, historian, laura, veccia, vaglieri, calls, their, assessment, logical, and, writes, that, it, seems, impossible, that, kh, lid, could, have, made, such, a, detour, which, would, have, taken, him, so, far, out, of, his, way, while, delaying, the, accomplishment, of, his, mission, vaglieri, surmises, that, the, oasis, was, conquered, by, iyad, ibn, ghanm, or, possibly, amr, ibn, al, as, as, the, latter, had, been, previously, tasked, during, the, ridda, wars, with, suppressing, wadi, a, who, had, barricaded, himself, in, dumat, al, jandal, crone, dismissing, khalid, s, role, in, iraq, entirely, asserts, that, khalid, had, definitively, captured, dumat, al, jandal, in, the, 631, campaign, and, from, there, crossed, the, desert, to, engage, in, the, syrian, conquest, the, starting, point, of, khalid, s, general, march, to, syria, was, al, hira, according, to, most, of, the, traditional, accounts, with, the, exception, of, al, baladhuri, who, places, it, at, ayn, al, tamr, the, segment, of, the, general, march, called, the, desert, march, by, the, sources, occurred, at, an, unclear, stage, after, the, al, hira, departure, this, phase, entailed, khalid, and, his, men, numbering, between, 500, and, 800, strong, marching, from, a, well, called, quraqir, across, a, vast, stretch, of, waterless, desert, for, six, days, and, five, nights, until, reaching, a, source, of, water, at, a, place, called, suwa, as, his, men, did, not, possess, sufficient, waterskins, to, traverse, this, distance, with, their, horses, and, camels, khalid, had, some, twenty, of, his, camels, increase, their, typical, water, intake, and, sealed, their, mouths, to, prevent, the, camels, from, eating, and, consequently, spoiling, the, water, in, their, stomachs, each, day, of, the, march, he, had, a, number, of, the, camels, slaughtered, so, his, men, could, drink, the, water, stored, in, the, camels, stomachs, the, utilization, of, the, camels, as, water, storage, and, the, locating, of, the, water, source, at, suwa, were, the, result, of, advice, given, to, khalid, by, his, guide, rafi, ibn, amr, of, the, tayy, excluding, the, above, mentioned, operations, in, dumat, al, jandal, and, the, upper, euphrates, valley, the, traditional, accounts, agree, on, only, two, events, of, khalid, s, route, to, syria, after, the, departure, from, al, hira, the, desert, march, between, quraqir, and, suwa, and, a, subsequent, raid, against, the, bahra, tribe, at, or, near, suwa, and, operations, which, resulted, in, the, submission, of, palmyra, otherwise, they, diverge, in, tracing, khalid, s, itinerary, based, on, these, accounts, donner, summarizes, three, possible, routes, taken, by, khalid, to, the, vicinity, of, damascus, two, via, palmyra, from, the, north, and, the, one, via, dumat, al, jandal, from, the, south, kennedy, notes, the, sources, are, equally, certain, in, their, advocacy, of, their, respective, itineraries, and, there, is, simply, no, knowing, which, version, is, correct, in, the, first, palmyra, damascus, itinerary, khalid, marches, upwards, along, the, euphrates, passing, through, places, he, had, previously, reduced, to, jabal, al, bishri, and, from, there, successively, moves, southwestwards, through, palmyra, al, qaryatayn, and, huwwarin, before, reaching, the, damascus, area, in, this, route, the, only, span, where, a, desert, march, could, have, occurred, is, between, jabal, al, bishri, and, palmyra, though, the, area, between, the, two, places, is, considerably, less, than, a, six, day, march, and, contains, a, number, of, water, sources, the, second, palmyra, damascus, itinerary, is, a, relatively, direct, route, between, al, hira, and, palmyra, via, ayn, al, tamr, the, stretch, of, desert, between, ayn, al, tamr, and, palmyra, is, long, enough, to, corroborate, a, six, day, march, and, contains, scarce, watering, points, though, there, are, no, placenames, that, can, be, interpreted, as, quraqir, or, suwa, in, the, dumat, al, jandal, damascus, route, such, placenames, exist, namely, the, sites, of, qulban, qurajir, associated, with, quraqir, along, the, eastern, edge, of, wadi, sirhan, and, sab, biyar, which, is, identified, with, suwa, 150, kilometers, 93, mi, east, of, damascus, the, span, between, the, two, sites, is, arid, and, corresponds, with, the, six, day, march, narrative, the, desert, march, is, the, most, celebrated, episode, of, khalid, s, expedition, and, medieval, futuh, islamic, conquests, literature, in, general, kennedy, writes, that, the, desert, march, has, been, enshrined, in, history, and, legend, arab, sources, marvelled, at, his, endurance, modern, scholars, have, seen, him, as, a, master, of, strategy, he, asserts, it, is, certain, khalid, embarked, on, the, march, a, memorable, feat, of, military, endurance, and, his, arrival, in, syria, was, an, important, ingredient, of, the, success, of, muslim, arms, there, the, historian, moshe, gil, calls, the, march, a, feat, which, has, no, parallel, and, a, testament, to, khalid, s, qualities, as, an, outstanding, commander, the, historian, ryan, j, lynch, deems, khalid, s, desert, march, to, be, a, literary, construct, by, the, authors, of, the, islamic, tradition, to, form, a, narrative, linking, the, muslim, conquests, of, iraq, and, syria, and, presenting, the, conquests, as, a, well, calculated, singular, affair, in, line, with, the, authors, alleged, polemical, motives, lynch, holds, that, the, story, of, the, march, which, would, have, excited, and, entertained, muslim, audiences, was, created, out, of, fragments, of, social, memory, by, inhabitants, who, attributed, the, conquests, of, their, towns, or, areas, to, khalid, as, a, means, to, earn, a, certain, degree, of, prestige, through, association, with, the, famous, general, most, traditional, accounts, have, the, first, muslim, armies, deploy, to, syria, from, medina, at, the, beginning, of, 13, ah, early, spring, 634, the, commanders, of, the, muslim, armies, were, amr, ibn, al, as, yazid, ibn, abi, sufyan, shurahbil, ibn, hasana, and, abu, ubayda, ibn, al, jarrah, though, the, last, may, have, not, deployed, to, syria, until, after, umar, s, succession, to, the, caliphate, in, the, summer, of, 634, following, abu, bakr, s, death, according, to, donner, the, traditional, sources, dating, of, the, first, muslim, armies, deployment, to, syria, was, behind, by, several, months, it, most, likely, occurred, in, the, autumn, of, 633, which, better, conforms, with, the, anonymous, syriac, chronicle, of, 724, which, dates, the, first, clash, between, the, muslim, armies, and, the, byzantines, to, february, 634, by, the, time, khalid, had, left, iraq, the, muslim, armies, in, syria, had, already, fought, a, number, of, skirmishes, with, local, byzantine, garrisons, and, dominated, the, southern, syrian, countryside, but, did, not, control, any, urban, centers, khalid, was, appointed, supreme, commander, of, the, muslim, armies, in, syria, accounts, cited, by, al, baladhuri, al, tabari, ibn, a, tham, al, fasawi, d, 987, and, ibn, hubaysh, al, asadi, hold, that, abu, bakr, appointed, khalid, supreme, commander, as, part, of, his, reassignment, from, iraq, to, syria, citing, the, general, s, military, talents, and, record, a, single, account, in, al, baladhuri, instead, attributes, khalid, s, appointment, to, a, consensus, among, the, commanders, already, in, syria, though, athamina, asserts, it, is, inconceivable, that, a, man, like, would, agree, to, such, a, decision, voluntarily, upon, his, accession, umar, may, have, confirmed, khalid, as, supreme, commander, khalid, reached, the, meadow, of, marj, rahit, north, of, damascus, after, his, army, s, trek, across, the, desert, he, arrived, on, easter, day, of, that, year, i, e, 24, april, 634, a, rare, precise, date, cited, by, most, traditional, sources, which, donner, deems, to, be, likely, correct, there, khalid, attacked, a, group, of, ghassanids, celebrating, easter, before, he, or, his, subordinate, commanders, raided, the, ghouta, agricultural, belt, around, damascus, afterward, khalid, and, the, commanders, of, the, earlier, muslim, armies, except, for, amr, assembled, at, bosra, southeast, of, damascus, the, trading, center, of, bosra, along, with, the, hauran, region, in, which, it, lies, had, historically, supplied, the, nomadic, tribes, of, arabia, with, wheat, oil, and, wine, and, had, been, visited, by, muhammad, during, his, youth, the, byzantines, may, not, have, reestablished, an, imperial, garrison, in, the, city, in, the, aftermath, of, the, sasanian, withdrawal, in, 628, and, the, muslim, armies, encountered, token, resistance, during, their, siege, bosra, capitulated, in, late, may, 634, making, it, the, first, major, city, in, syria, to, fall, to, the, muslims, khalid, and, the, muslim, commanders, headed, west, to, palestine, to, join, amr, as, the, latter, s, subordinates, in, the, battle, of, ajnadayn, the, first, major, confrontation, with, the, byzantines, in, july, the, battle, ended, in, a, decisive, victory, for, the, muslims, and, the, byzantines, retreated, toward, pella, fahl, in, arabic, a, major, city, east, of, the, jordan, river, the, muslims, pursued, them, and, scored, another, major, victory, at, the, battle, of, fahl, though, it, is, unclear, if, amr, or, khalid, held, overall, command, in, the, engagement, the, remnants, of, the, byzantine, forces, from, ajnadayn, and, fahl, retreated, north, to, damascus, where, the, byzantine, commanders, called, for, imperial, reinforcements, khalid, advanced, possibly, besting, a, byzantine, unit, at, the, marj, al, suffar, plain, before, besieging, the, city, each, of, the, five, muslim, commanders, were, charged, with, blocking, one, of, the, city, gates, khalid, was, stationed, at, bab, sharqi, the,

determination, approached, khalid, at, bab, sharqi, with, an, offer, to, open, the, gate, in, return, for, assurances, of, safety, khalid, accepted, and, ordered, the, drafting, of, a, capitulation, agreement, although, several, versions, of, khalid, s, treaty, were, recorded, in, the, early, muslim, and, christian, sources, they, generally, concur, that, the, inhabitants, lives, properties, and, churches, were, to, be, safeguarded, in, return, for, their, payment, of, the, jizya, poll, tax, imperial, properties, were, confiscated, by, the, muslims, the, treaty, probably, served, as, the, model, for, the, capitulation, agreements, made, throughout, syria, as, well, iraq, and, egypt, during, the, early, muslim, conquests, although, the, accounts, cited, by, al, waqidi, d, 823, and, ibn, ishaq, agree, that, damascus, surrendered, in, august, september, 635, they, provide, varying, timelines, of, the, siege, ranging, from, four, to, fourteen, months, in, the, spring, of, 636, khalid, withdrew, his, forces, from, damascus, to, the, old, ghassanid, capital, at, jabiya, in, the, golan, he, was, prompted, by, the, approach, of, a, large, byzantine, army, dispatched, by, heraclius, consisting, of, imperial, troops, led, by, vahan, and, theodore, trithyrius, and, frontier, troops, including, christian, arab, light, cavalry, led, by, the, ghassanid, phylarch, jabala, ibn, al, ayham, and, armenian, auxiliaries, led, by, a, certain, georgius, called, jaraja, by, the, arabs, the, sizes, of, the, forces, are, disputed, by, modern, historians, donner, holds, the, byzantines, outnumbered, the, muslims, four, to, one, walter, e, kaegi, writes, the, byzantines, probably, enjoyed, numerical, superiority, with, 15, 000, 20, 000, or, more, troops, and, john, walter, jandora, holds, there, was, likely, near, parity, in, numbers, between, the, two, sides, with, the, muslims, at, 36, 000, men, including, 10, 000, from, khalid, s, army, and, the, byzantines, at, about, 40, 000, the, byzantine, army, set, up, camp, at, the, ruqqad, tributary, west, of, the, muslims, positions, at, jabiya, khalid, consequently, withdrew, taking, up, position, north, of, the, yarmouk, river, close, to, where, the, ruqqad, meets, the, yarmouk, the, area, spanned, high, hilltops, water, sources, critical, routes, connecting, damascus, to, the, galilee, and, historic, pastures, of, the, ghassanids, for, over, a, month, the, muslims, held, the, strategic, high, ground, between, adhri, at, modern, daraa, and, their, camp, near, dayr, ayyub, and, bested, the, byzantines, in, a, skirmish, outside, jabiya, on, 23, july, 636, jandora, asserts, that, the, byzantines, christian, arab, and, armenian, auxiliaries, deserted, or, defected, but, that, the, byzantine, force, remained, formidable, consisting, of, a, vanguard, of, heavy, cavalry, and, a, rear, guard, of, infantrymen, when, they, approached, the, muslim, defensive, lines, khalid, split, his, cavalry, into, two, main, groups, each, positioned, behind, the, muslims, right, and, left, infantry, wings, to, protect, his, forces, from, a, potential, envelopment, by, the, byzantine, heavy, cavalry, he, stationed, an, elite, squadron, of, 200, 300, horsemen, to, support, the, center, of, his, defensive, line, and, left, archers, posted, in, the, muslims, camp, near, dayr, ayyub, where, they, could, be, most, effective, against, an, incoming, byzantine, force, the, byzantines, initial, assaults, against, the, muslims, right, and, left, flanks, successively, failed, but, they, kept, up, the, momentum, until, the, entire, muslim, line, fell, back, or, as, contemporary, christian, sources, maintain, feigned, retreat, the, byzantines, pursued, the, muslims, into, their, camp, where, the, muslims, had, their, camel, herds, hobbled, to, form, a, series, of, defensive, perimeters, from, which, the, infantry, could, fight, and, which, byzantine, cavalries, could, not, easily, penetrate, as, a, result, the, byzantines, were, left, vulnerable, to, attack, by, muslim, archers, their, momentum, was, halted, and, their, left, flank, exposed, khalid, and, his, cavalries, used, the, opportunity, to, pierce, the, byzantines, left, flank, taking, advantage, of, the, gap, between, the, byzantine, infantry, and, cavalry, khalid, enveloped, the, opposing, heavy, cavalry, on, either, side, but, intentionally, left, an, opening, from, which, the, byzantines, could, only, escape, northward, far, from, their, infantry, according, to, the, 9th, century, byzantine, historian, theophanes, the, byzantine, infantry, mutinied, under, vahan, possibly, in, light, of, theodore, s, failure, to, counter, the, attack, on, the, cavalry, the, infantry, was, subsequently, routed, the, byzantine, cavalry, meanwhile, had, withdrawn, north, to, the, area, between, the, ruqqad, and, allan, tributaries, khalid, sent, a, force, to, pursue, and, prevent, them, from, regrouping, he, followed, up, with, a, nighttime, operation, in, which, he, seized, the, ruqqad, bridge, the, only, viable, withdrawal, route, for, the, byzantines, the, muslims, then, assaulted, the, byzantines, camps, on, 20, august, and, massacred, most, of, the, byzantine, troops, or, induced, panic, in, byzantine, ranks, causing, thousands, to, die, in, the, yarmouk, s, ravines, in, an, attempt, to, make, a, westward, retreat, jandora, credits, the, muslim, victory, at, yarmouk, to, the, cohesion, and, superior, leadership, of, the, muslim, army, particularly, the, ingenuity, of, khalid, in, comparison, to, the, widespread, discord, in, the, byzantine, army, s, ranks, and, the, conventional, tactics, of, theodorus, which, khalid, correctly, anticipated, in, gil, s, view, khalid, s, withdrawal, before, the, army, of, heraclius, the, evacuation, of, damascus, and, the, counter, movement, on, the, yarmouk, tributaries, are, evidence, of, his, excellent, organising, ability, and, his, skill, at, manoeuvring, on, the, battlefield, the, byzantine, rout, marked, the, destruction, of, their, last, effective, army, in, syria, immediately, securing, earlier, muslim, gains, in, palestine, and, transjordan, and, paving, the, way, for, the, recapture, of, damascus, in, december, this, time, by, abu, ubayda, and, the, conquest, of, the, beqaa, valley, and, ultimately, the, rest, of, syria, to, the, north, in, jandora, s, assessment, yarmouk, was, one, of, the, most, important, battles, of, world, history, ultimately, leading, to, muslim, victories, which, expanded, the, caliphate, between, the, pyrenees, mountains, and, central, asia, khalid, was, retained, as, supreme, commander, of, the, muslim, forces, in, syria, between, six, months, and, two, years, from, the, start, of, umar, s, caliphate, depending, on, the, source, modern, historians, mostly, agree, that, umar, s, dismissal, of, khalid, probably, occurred, in, the, aftermath, of, yarmouk, the, caliph, appointed, abu, ubayda, to, khalid, s, place, reassigned, his, troops, to, the, remaining, muslim, commanders, and, subordinated, khalid, under, the, command, of, one, of, abu, ubayda, s, lieutenants, a, later, order, deployed, the, bulk, of, khalid, s, former, troops, to, iraq, varied, causes, for, khalid, s, dismissal, from, the, supreme, command, are, cited, by, the, early, islamic, sources, among, them, were, his, independent, decision, making, and, minimal, coordination, with, the, leadership, in, medina, older, allegations, of, moral, misconduct, including, his, execution, of, malik, ibn, nuwayra, and, subsequent, marriage, to, malik, s, widow, accusations, of, generous, distribution, of, booty, to, members, of, the, tribal, nobility, to, the, detriment, of, eligible, early, muslim, converts, personal, animosity, between, khalid, and, umar, and, umar, s, uneasiness, over, khalid, s, heroic, reputation, among, the, muslims, which, he, feared, could, develop, into, a, personality, cult, the, modern, historians, de, goeje, william, muir, and, andreas, stratos, viewed, umar, s, enmity, with, khalid, as, a, contributing, cause, of, khalid, s, dismissal, shaban, acknowledges, the, enmity, but, asserts, it, had, no, bearing, on, the, caliph, s, decision, de, goeje, dismisses, khalid, s, extravagant, grants, to, the, tribal, nobility, a, common, practice, among, the, early, muslim, leaders, including, muhammad, as, a, cause, for, his, sacking, muir, becker, stratos, and, philip, k, hitti, have, proposed, that, khalid, was, ultimately, dismissed, because, the, muslim, gains, in, syria, in, the, aftermath, of, yarmouk, required, the, replacement, of, a, military, commander, at, the, helm, with, a, capable, administrator, such, as, abu, ubayda, athamina, doubts, all, the, aforementioned, reasons, arguing, the, cause, must, have, been, vital, at, a, time, when, large, parts, of, syria, remained, under, byzantine, control, and, heraclius, had, not, abandoned, the, province, athamina, holds, that, with, all, his, military, limitations, abu, ubayda, would, not, have, been, considered, a, worthy, replacement, for, kh, lid, s, incomparable, talents, medina, s, lack, of, a, regular, standing, army, the, need, to, redeploy, fighters, to, other, fronts, and, the, byzantine, threat, to, muslim, gains, in, syria, all, required, the, establishment, of, a, defense, structure, based, on, the, older, established, arab, tribes, in, syria, which, had, served, as, confederates, of, byzantium, after, medina, s, entreaties, to, the, leading, confederates, the, ghassanids, were, rebuffed, relations, were, established, with, the, kalb, judham, and, lakhm, these, tribes, likely, considered, the, large, numbers, of, outside, arab, tribesmen, in, khalid, s, army, as, a, threat, to, their, political, and, economic, power, khalid, s, initial, force, of, 500, 800, men, had, swelled, to, as, high, as, 10, 000, as, a, result, of, tribesmen, joining, his, army, s, ranks, from, the, iraqi, front, or, arabia, and, as, high, as, 30, 000, 40, 000, factoring, in, their, families, athamina, concludes, umar, dismissed, khalid, and, recalled, his, troops, from, syria, as, an, overture, to, the, kalb, and, their, allies, abu, ubayda, and, khalid, proceeded, from, damascus, northward, to, homs, called, emesa, by, the, byzantines, and, besieged, the, city, probably, in, the, winter, of, 636, 637, the, siege, held, amid, a, number, of, sorties, by, the, byzantine, defenders, and, the, city, capitulated, in, the, spring, per, the, surrender, terms, taxes, were, imposed, on, the, inhabitants, in, return, for, guarantees, of, protection, for, their, property, churches, water, mills, and, the, city, walls, a, quarter, of, the, church, of, st, john, was, reserved, for, muslim, use, and, abandoned, houses, and, gardens, were, confiscated, and, distributed, by, abu, ubayda, or, khalid, among, the, muslim, troops, and, their, families, owing, to, its, proximity, to, the, desert, steppe, homs, was, viewed, as, a, favorable, place, of, settlement, for, arab, tribesmen, and, became, the, first, city, in, syria, to, acquire, a, large, muslim, population, information, about, the, subsequent, conquests, in, northern, syria, is, scant, and, partly, contradictory, khalid, was, dispatched, by, abu, ubayda, to, conquer, qinnasrin, called, chalcis, by, the, byzantines, and, nearby, aleppo, khalid, routed, a, byzantine, force, led, by, a, certain, minas, in, the, outskirts, of, qinnasrin, there, khalid, spared, the, inhabitants, following, their, appeal, and, claim, that, they, were, arabs, forcibly, conscripted, by, the, byzantines, he, followed, up, by, besieging, the, walled, town, of, qinnasrin, which, capitulated, in, august, september, 638, he, and, iyad, ibn, ghanm, then, launched, the, first, muslim, raid, into, byzantine, anatolia, khalid, made, qinnasrin, his, headquarters, settling, there, with, his, wife, khalid, was, appointed, abu, ubayda, s, deputy, governor, in, qinnasrin, in, 638, the, campaigns, against, homs, and, qinnasrin, resulted, in, the, conquest, of, northwestern, syria, and, prompted, heraclius, to, abandon, his, headquarters, at, edessa, for, samosata, in, anatolia, and, ultimately, to, the, imperial, capital, of, constantinople, khalid, may, have, participated, in, the, siege, of, jerusalem, which, capitulated, in, 637, or, 638, according, to, al, tabari, he, was, one, of, the, witnesses, of, a, letter, of, assurance, by, umar, to, patriarch, sophronius, of, jerusalem, guaranteeing, the, safety, of, the, city, s, people, and, property, according, to, sayf, ibn, umar, later, in, 638, khalid, was, rumored, to, have, lavishly, distributed, war, spoils, from, his, northern, syrian, campaigns, including, a, sum, to, the, kindite, nobleman, al, ash, ath, ibn, qays, umar, consequently, ordered, that, abu, ubayda, publicly, interrogate, and, relieve, khalid, from, his, post, regardless, of, the, interrogation, s, outcome, as, well, as, to, put, qinnasrin, under, abu, ubayda, s, direct, administration, following, his, interrogation, in, homs, khalid, issued, successive, farewell, speeches, to, the, troops, in, qinnasrin, and, homs, before, being, summoned, by, umar, to, medina, sayf, s, account, notes, that, umar, sent, notice, to, the, muslim, garrisons, in, syria, and, iraq, that, khalid, was, dismissed, not, as, a, result, of, improprieties, but, because, the, troops, had, become, captivated, by, illusions, on, account, of, him, and, he, feared, they, would, disproportionately, place, their, trust, in, him, rather, than, god, khalid, s, sacking, did, not, elicit, public, backlash, possibly, due, to, existing, awareness, in, the, muslim, polity, of, umar, s, enmity, toward, khalid, which, prepared, the, public, for, his, dismissal, or, because, of, existing, hostility, toward, the, makhzum, in, general, as, a, result, of, their, earlier, opposition, to, muhammad, and, the, early, muslims, in, the, account, of, ibn, asakir, umar, declared, at, a, council, of, the, muslim, army, at, jabiya, in, 638, that, khalid, was, dismissed, for, lavishing, war, spoils, on, war, heroes, tribal, nobles, and, poets, instead, of, reserving, the, sums, for, needy, muslims, no, attending, commanders, voiced, opposition, except, for, a, makhzumite, who, accused, umar, of, violating, the, military, mandate, given, to, khalid, by, muhammad, according, to, the, muslim, jurist, al, zuhri, d, 742, before, his, death, in, 639, abu, ubayda, appointed, khalid, and, iyad, ibn, ghanm, as, his, successors, but, umar, confirmed, only, iyad, as, governor, of, the, homs, qinnasrin, jazira, district, and, appointed, yazid, ibn, abi, sufyan, governor, over, the, rest, of, syria, namely, the, districts, of, damascus, jordan, and, palestine, khalid, died, in, medina, or, homs, in, 21, ah, c, 642, ce, purported, hadiths, related, about, khalid, include, muhammad, s, urgings, to, muslims, not, to, harm, khalid, and, prophecies, that, khalid, would, be, dealt, injustices, despite, his, tremendous, contributions, to, islam, in, islamic, literary, narratives, umar, expresses, remorse, over, dismissing, khalid, and, the, women, of, medina, mourn, his, death, en, masse, athamina, considers, these, all, to, be, no, more, than, latter, day, expressions, of, sympathy, on, the, part, of, subsequent, generations, for, the, heroic, character, of, khalid, as, portrayed, by, islamic, tradition, khalid, is, credited, by, the, early, sources, for, being, the, most, effective, commander, of, the, conquests, including, after, his, dismissal, from, the, supreme, command, he, is, considered, one, of, the, tactical, geniuses, of, the, early, islamic, period, by, donner, the, historian, carole, hillenbrand, calls, him, the, most, famous, of, all, arab, muslim, generals, and, humphreys, describes, him, as, perhaps, the, most, famous, and, brilliant, arab, general, of, the, riddah, wars, and, the, early, conquests, in, kennedy, s, assessment, khalid, was, a, brilliant, ruthless, military, commander, but, one, with, whom, the, more, pious, muslims, could, never, feel, entirely, comfortable, while, recognizing, his, military, achievements, the, early, islamic, sources, present, a, mixed, assessment, of, khalid, due, to, his, early, confrontation, with, muhammad, at, uhud, his, reputation, for, brutal, or, disproportionate, actions, against, arab, tribesmen, during, the, ridda, wars, and, his, military, fame, which, disturbed, the, pious, early, converts, according, to, the, historian, richard, blackburn, despite, attempts, in, the, early, sources, to, discredit, khalid, his, reputation, has, developed, as, islam, s, most, formidable, warrior, during, the, eras, of, muhammad, abu, bakr, and, the, conquest, of, syria, kennedy, notes, that, his, reputation, as, a, great, general, has, lasted, through, the, generations, and, streets, are, named, after, him, all, over, the, arab, world, khalid, is, considered, a, war, hero, by, sunni, muslims, while, many, shia, muslims, view, him, as, a, war, criminal, for, his, execution, of, malik, ibn, nuwayra, and, immediate, marriage, of, his, widow, in, contravention, of, the, traditional, islamic, bereavement, period, khalid, s, eldest, son, was,

in, 750, or, shortly, after, when, all, forty, of, his, male, descendants, died, in, a, plague, in, syria, according, to, the, 11th, century, historian, ibn, hazm, as, a, result, his, family, s, properties, including, his, residence, and, several, other, houses, in, medina, were, inherited, by, ayyub, ibn, salama, a, great, grandson, of, khalid, s, brother, al, walid, ibn, al, walid, they,
