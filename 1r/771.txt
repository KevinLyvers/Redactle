georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 27, august, 1770, 14, november, 1831, was, a, german, philosopher, and, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, of, german, idealism, and, 19th, century, philosophy, his, influence, extends, across, the, entire, range, of, contemporary, philosophical, topics, from, metaphysical, issues, in, epistemology, and, ontology, to, political, philosophy, the, philosophy, of, history, philosophy, of, art, philosophy, of, religion, and, the, history, of, philosophy, born, in, 1770, in, stuttgart, holy, roman, empire, during, the, transitional, period, between, the, enlightenment, and, the, romantic, movement, in, the, germanic, regions, of, europe, hegel, lived, through, and, was, influenced, by, the, french, revolution, and, the, napoleonic, wars, his, fame, rests, chiefly, upon, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, the, science, of, logic, his, teleological, account, of, history, and, his, lectures, at, the, university, of, berlin, on, topics, from, his, encyclopedia, of, the, philosophical, sciences, throughout, his, work, hegel, strove, to, address, and, correct, the, problematic, dualisms, of, modern, philosophy, kantian, and, otherwise, typically, by, drawing, upon, the, resources, of, ancient, philosophy, particularly, aristotle, hegel, everywhere, insists, that, reason, and, freedom, are, historical, achievements, not, natural, givens, his, dialectical, speculative, procedure, is, grounded, in, the, principle, of, immanence, that, is, in, assessing, claims, always, according, to, their, own, internal, criteria, taking, skepticism, seriously, he, contends, that, people, cannot, presume, any, truths, that, have, not, passed, the, test, of, experience, even, the, a, priori, categories, of, the, logic, must, attain, their, verification, in, the, natural, world, and, the, historical, accomplishments, of, humankind, guided, by, the, delphic, imperative, to, know, thyself, hegel, presents, free, self, determination, as, the, essence, of, humankind, a, conclusion, from, his, 1806, 07, phenomenology, that, he, claims, is, further, verified, by, the, systematic, account, of, the, interdependence, of, logic, nature, and, spirit, in, his, later, encyclopedia, he, asserts, that, the, logic, at, once, preserves, and, overcomes, the, dualisms, of, the, material, and, the, mental, that, is, it, accounts, for, both, the, continuity, and, difference, marking, the, domains, of, nature, and, culture, as, a, metaphysically, necessary, and, coherent, identity, of, identity, and, non, identity, hegel, was, born, on, 27, august, 1770, in, stuttgart, capital, of, the, duchy, of, w, rttemberg, in, the, holy, roman, empire, now, southwestern, germany, christened, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, he, was, known, as, wilhelm, to, his, close, family, his, father, georg, ludwig, hegel, 1733, 1799, was, secretary, to, the, revenue, office, at, the, court, of, karl, eugen, duke, of, w, rttemberg, hegel, s, mother, maria, magdalena, louisa, hegel, n, e, fromm, 1741, 1783, was, the, daughter, of, a, lawyer, at, the, high, court, of, justice, at, the, w, rttemberg, court, ludwig, albrecht, fromm, 1696, 1758, she, died, of, bilious, fever, when, hegel, was, thirteen, hegel, and, his, father, also, caught, the, disease, but, narrowly, survived, hegel, had, a, sister, chistiane, luise, 1773, 1832, and, a, brother, georg, ludwig, 1776, 1812, who, perished, as, an, officer, during, napoleon, s, 1812, russian, campaign, at, the, age, of, three, hegel, went, to, the, german, school, when, he, entered, the, latin, school, two, years, later, he, already, knew, the, first, declension, having, been, taught, it, by, his, mother, 4, in, 1776, he, entered, stuttgart, s, eberhard, ludwigs, gymnasium, and, during, his, adolescence, read, voraciously, copying, lengthy, extracts, in, his, diary, authors, he, read, include, the, poet, friedrich, gottlieb, klopstock, and, writers, associated, with, the, enlightenment, such, as, christian, garve, and, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, in, 1844, hegel, s, first, biographer, karl, rosenkranz, described, the, young, hegel, s, education, there, by, saying, that, it, belonged, entirely, to, the, enlightenment, with, respect, to, principle, and, entirely, to, classical, antiquity, with, respect, to, curriculum, his, studies, at, the, gymnasium, concluded, with, his, graduation, speech, the, abortive, state, of, art, and, scholarship, in, turkey, at, the, age, of, eighteen, hegel, entered, the, t, binger, stift, a, protestant, seminary, attached, to, the, university, of, t, bingen, where, he, had, as, roommates, the, poet, and, philosopher, friedrich, h, lderlin, and, the, future, philosopher, friedrich, schelling, sharing, a, dislike, for, what, they, regarded, as, the, restrictive, environment, of, the, seminary, the, three, became, close, friends, and, mutually, influenced, each, other, s, ideas, it, is, mostly, likely, that, hegel, attended, the, stift, because, it, was, state, funded, for, he, had, a, profound, distaste, for, the, study, of, orthodox, theology, and, never, wanted, to, become, a, minister, all, three, greatly, admired, hellenic, civilization, and, hegel, additionally, steeped, himself, in, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, lessing, during, this, time, they, watched, the, unfolding, of, the, french, revolution, with, shared, enthusiasm, although, the, violence, of, the, 1793, reign, of, terror, dampened, hegel, s, hopes, he, continued, to, identify, with, the, moderate, girondin, faction, and, never, lost, his, commitment, to, the, principles, of, 1789, which, he, expressed, by, drinking, a, toast, to, the, storming, of, the, bastille, every, fourteenth, of, july, schelling, and, h, lderlin, immersed, themselves, in, theoretical, debates, on, kantian, philosophy, from, which, hegel, remained, aloof, hegel, at, this, time, envisaged, his, future, as, that, of, a, popularphilosoph, a, man, of, letters, who, serves, to, make, the, abstruse, ideas, of, philosophers, accessible, to, a, wider, public, his, own, felt, need, to, engage, critically, with, the, central, ideas, of, kantianism, would, not, come, until, 1800, having, received, his, theological, certificate, from, the, t, bingen, seminary, hegel, became, hofmeister, house, tutor, to, an, aristocratic, family, in, berne, 1793, 1796, during, this, period, he, composed, the, text, which, has, become, known, as, the, life, of, jesus, and, a, book, length, manuscript, titled, the, positivity, of, the, christian, religion, his, relations, with, his, employers, becoming, strained, hegel, accepted, an, offer, mediated, by, h, lderlin, to, take, up, a, similar, position, with, a, wine, merchant, s, family, in, frankfurt, in, 1797, there, h, lderlin, exerted, an, important, influence, on, hegel, s, thought, in, berne, hegel, s, writings, had, been, sharply, critical, of, orthodox, christianity, but, in, frankfurt, under, the, influence, of, early, romanticism, he, underwent, a, sort, of, reversal, exploring, in, particular, the, mystical, experience, of, love, as, the, true, essence, of, religion, also, in, 1797, the, unpublished, and, unsigned, manuscript, of, the, oldest, systematic, program, of, german, idealism, was, written, it, was, written, in, hegel, s, hand, but, may, have, been, authored, by, hegel, schelling, or, h, lderlin, while, in, frankfurt, hegel, composed, the, essay, fragments, on, religion, and, love, in, 1799, he, wrote, another, essay, titled, the, spirit, of, christianity, and, its, fate, unpublished, during, his, lifetime, in, 1801, hegel, came, to, jena, at, the, encouragement, of, schelling, who, held, the, position, of, extraordinary, professor, at, the, university, of, jena, hegel, secured, a, position, at, the, university, of, jena, as, a, privatdozent, unsalaried, lecturer, after, submitting, the, inaugural, dissertation, de, orbitis, planetarum, in, which, he, briefly, criticized, mathematical, arguments, that, assert, that, there, must, exist, a, planet, between, mars, and, jupiter, later, in, the, year, hegel, s, essay, the, difference, between, fichte, s, and, schelling, s, system, of, philosophy, was, completed, he, lectured, on, logic, and, metaphysics, and, gave, lectures, with, schelling, on, an, introduction, to, the, idea, and, limits, of, true, philosophy, and, facilitated, a, philosophical, disputorium, in, 1802, schelling, and, hegel, founded, the, journal, kritische, journal, der, philosophie, critical, journal, of, philosophy, to, which, they, contributed, until, the, collaboration, ended, when, schelling, left, for, w, rzburg, in, 1803, in, 1805, the, university, promoted, hegel, to, the, unsalaried, position, of, extraordinary, professor, after, he, wrote, a, letter, to, the, poet, and, minister, of, culture, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, protesting, the, promotion, of, his, philosophical, adversary, jakob, friedrich, fries, ahead, of, him, hegel, attempted, to, enlist, the, help, of, the, poet, and, translator, johann, heinrich, vo, to, obtain, a, post, at, the, renascent, university, of, heidelberg, but, he, failed, to, his, chagrin, fries, was, in, the, same, year, made, ordinary, professor, salaried, the, following, february, marked, the, birth, of, hegel, s, illegitimate, son, georg, ludwig, friedrich, fischer, 1807, 1831, as, the, result, of, an, affair, with, hegel, s, landlady, christiana, burkhardt, n, e, fischer, with, his, finances, drying, up, quickly, hegel, was, under, great, pressure, to, deliver, his, book, the, long, promised, introduction, to, his, philosophical, system, hegel, was, putting, the, finishing, touches, to, it, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, as, napoleon, engaged, prussian, troops, on, 14, october, 1806, in, the, battle, of, jena, on, a, plateau, outside, the, city, on, the, day, before, the, battle, napoleon, entered, the, city, of, jena, hegel, recounted, his, impressions, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, friedrich, immanuel, niethammer, i, saw, the, emperor, this, world, soul, riding, out, of, the, city, on, reconnaissance, it, is, indeed, a, wonderful, sensation, to, see, such, an, individual, who, concentrated, here, at, a, single, point, astride, a, horse, reaches, out, over, the, world, and, masters, it, hegel, biographer, terry, pinkard, notes, that, hegel, s, comment, to, niethammer, is, all, the, more, striking, since, he, had, already, composed, the, crucial, section, of, the, phenomenology, in, which, he, remarked, that, the, revolution, had, now, officially, passed, to, another, land, germany, that, would, complete, in, thought, what, the, revolution, had, only, partially, accomplished, in, practice, although, napoleon, had, spared, the, university, of, jena, from, much, of, the, destruction, of, the, surrounding, city, few, students, returned, after, the, battle, and, enrollment, suffered, making, hegel, s, financial, prospects, even, worse, hegel, traveled, in, the, winter, to, bamberg, and, stayed, with, niethammer, to, oversee, the, proofs, of, the, phenomenology, which, was, being, printed, there, although, hegel, tried, to, obtain, another, professorship, even, writing, goethe, in, an, attempt, to, help, secure, a, permanent, position, replacing, a, professor, of, botany, he, was, unable, to, find, a, permanent, position, in, 1807, he, had, to, move, to, bamberg, since, his, savings, and, the, payment, from, the, phenomenology, were, exhausted, and, he, needed, money, to, support, his, illegitimate, son, ludwig, there, he, became, the, editor, of, the, local, newspaper, bamberger, zeitung, a, position, he, obtained, with, the, help, of, niethammer, ludwig, fischer, and, his, mother, stayed, behind, in, jena, in, bamberg, as, editor, of, the, bamberger, zeitung, which, was, a, pro, french, newspaper, hegel, extolled, the, virtues, of, napoleon, and, often, editorialized, the, prussian, accounts, of, the, war, being, the, editor, of, a, local, newspaper, hegel, also, became, an, important, person, in, bamberg, social, life, often, visiting, with, the, local, official, johann, heinrich, liebeskind, and, becoming, involved, in, local, gossip, and, pursued, his, passions, for, cards, fine, eating, and, the, local, bamberg, beer, however, hegel, bore, contempt, for, what, he, saw, as, old, bavaria, frequently, referring, to, it, as, barbaria, and, dreaded, that, hometowns, like, bamberg, would, lose, their, autonomy, under, new, the, bavarian, state, after, being, investigated, in, september, 1808, by, the, bavarian, state, for, potentially, violating, security, measures, by, publishing, french, troop, movements, hegel, wrote, to, niethammer, now, a, high, official, in, munich, pleading, for, niethammer, s, help, in, securing, a, teaching, position, with, the, help, of, niethammer, hegel, was, appointed, headmaster, of, a, gymnasium, in, nuremberg, in, november, 1808, a, post, he, held, until, 1816, while, in, nuremberg, hegel, adapted, his, recently, published, phenomenology, of, spirit, for, use, in, the, classroom, part, of, his, remit, was, to, teach, a, class, called, introduction, to, knowledge, of, the, universal, coherence, of, the, sciences, in, 1811, hegel, married, marie, helena, susanna, von, tucher, 1791, 1855, the, eldest, daughter, of, a, senator, this, period, saw, the, publication, of, his, second, major, work, the, science, of, logic, wissenschaft, der, logik, 3, vols, 1812, 1813, and, 1816, and, the, birth, of, two, sons, karl, friedrich, wilhelm, 1813, 1901, and, immanuel, thomas, christian, 1814, 1891, having, received, offers, of, a, post, from, the, universities, of, erlangen, berlin, and, heidelberg, hegel, chose, heidelberg, where, he, moved, in, 1816, soon, after, his, illegitimate, son, ludwig, fischer, now, ten, years, old, joined, the, hegel, household, in, april, 1817, having, spent, time, in, an, orphanage, after, the, death, of, his, mother, christiana, burkhardt, in, 1817, hegel, published, the, encyclopedia, of, the, philosophical, sciences, in, outline, as, a, summary, of, his, philosophy, for, students, attending, his, lectures, at, heidelberg, it, is, also, while, in, heidelberg, that, hegel, first, lectured, on, the, philosophy, of, art, in, 1818, hegel, accepted, the, renewed, offer, of, the, chair, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, berlin, which, had, remained, vacant, since, johann, gottlieb, fichte, s, death, in, 1814, here, hegel, published, his, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, right, 1821, hegel, devoted, himself, primarily, to, delivering, lectures, his, lectures, on, the, philosophy, of, fine, art, the, philosophy, of, religion, the, philosophy, of, history, and, the, history, of, philosophy, were, published, posthumously, from, students, notes, in, spite, of, his, notoriously, terrible, delivery, his, fame, spread, and, his, lectures, attracted, students, from, all, over, germany, and, beyond, meanwhile, hegel, and, his, pupils, such, as, leopold, von, henning, friedrich, wilhelm, carov, were, harassed, and, put, under, the, surveillance, of, prince, sayn, wittgenstein, the, interior, minister, of, prussia, and, his, reactionary, circles, in, the, prussian, court, in, the, remainder, of, his, career, he, made, two, trips, to, weimar, where, he, met, with, goethe, for, the, last, time, and, to, brussels, the, northern, netherlands, leipzig, vienna, prague, and, paris, during, the, last, ten, years, of, his, life, hegel, did, not, publish, another, book, but, thoroughly, revised, the, encyclopedia, second, edition, 1827, third, 1830, in, his, political, philosophy, he, criticized, karl, ludwig, von, haller, s, reactionary, work, which, claimed, that, laws, were, not, necessary, a, number, of, other, works, on, the, philosophy, of, history, religion, aesthetics, and, the, history, of, philosophy, were, compiled, from, the, lecture, notes, of, his, students, and, published, posthumously, hegel, was, appointed, university, rector, of, the, university, in, october, 1829, but, his, term, ended, in, september, 1830, hegel, was, deeply, disturbed, by, the, riots, for, reform, in, berlin, in, that, year, in, 1831, frederick, william, iii, decorated, him, with, the, order, of, the, red, eagle, 3rd, class, for, his, service, to, the, prussian, state, in, august, 1831, a, cholera, epidemic, reached, berlin, and, hegel, left, the, city, taking, up, lodgings, in, kreuzberg, now, in, a, weak, state, of, health, hegel, seldom, went, out, as, the, new, semester, began, in, october, hegel, returned, to, berlin, in, the, mistaken, belief, that, the, epidemic, had, largely, subsided, by, 14, november, hegel, was, dead, the, physicians, pronounced, the, cause, of, death, as, cholera, but, it, is, likely, he, died, from, another, gastrointestinal, disease, his, last, words, are, said, to, have, been, there, was, only, one, man, who, ever, understood, me, and, even, he, didn, t, understand, me, he, was, buried, on, 16, november, in, accordance, with, his, wishes, hegel, was, buried, in, the, dorotheenstadt, cemetery, next, to, fichte, and, karl, wilhelm, ferdinand, solger, hegel, s, illegitimate, son, ludwig, fischer, had, died, shortly, before, while, serving, with, the, dutch, army, in, batavia, and, the, news, of, his, death, never, reached, his, father, early, the, following, year, hegel, s, sister, christiane, committed, suicide, by, drowning, hegel, s, two, remaining, sons, karl, who, became, a, historian, and, immanuel, who, followed, a, theological, path, lived, long, and, safeguarded, their, father, s, manuscripts, and, letters, and, produced, editions, of, his, works, as, h, s, harris, recounts, when, hegel, entered, the, t, bingen, seminary, in, 1788, he, was, a, typical, product, of, the, german, enlightenment, an, enthusiastic, reader, of, rousseau, and, lessing, acquainted, with, kant, at, least, at, second, hand, but, perhaps, more, deeply, devoted, to, the, classics, than, to, any, thing, modern, during, this, early, period, of, his, life, the, greeks, especially, plato, came, first, although, he, later, elevated, aristotle, above, plato, hegel, never, abandoned, his, love, of, ancient, philosophy, the, imprint, of, which, is, everywhere, in, his, thought, hegel, s, concern, with, various, forms, of, cultural, unity, judaic, greek, medieval, and, modern, during, this, early, period, would, remain, with, him, throughout, his, career, in, this, way, he, was, also, a, typical, product, of, early, german, romanticism, unity, of, life, was, the, phrase, used, by, hegel, and, his, generation, to, express, their, concept, of, the, highest, good, it, encompasses, unity, with, oneself, with, others, and, with, nature, the, main, threat, to, such, unity, consists, in, division, entzweiung, or, alienation, entfremdung, in, this, respect, hegel, was, particularly, taken, with, the, phenomenon, of, love, as, a, kind, of, unity, in, difference, this, both, in, the, ancient, articulation, provided, by, plato, and, in, the, christian, religion, s, doctrine, of, agape, which, hegel, at, this, time, viewed, as, already, grounded, on, universal, reason, this, interest, as, well, as, his, theological, training, would, continue, to, mark, his, thought, even, as, it, developed, in, a, more, theoretical, or, metaphysical, direction, according, to, glenn, alexander, magee, hegel, s, thought, in, particular, the, tripartite, structure, of, his, system, also, owes, much, to, the, hermetic, tradition, in, particular, the, work, of, jakob, b, hme, the, conviction, that, philosophy, must, take, the, form, of, a, system, hegel, owed, most, particularly, to, his, t, bingen, roommates, schelling, and, h, lderlin, hegel, also, read, widely, and, was, much, influenced, by, adam, smith, and, other, theorists, of, the, political, economy, it, was, kant, s, critical, philosophy, that, provided, what, hegel, took, as, the, definitive, modern, articulation, of, the, divisions, that, must, be, overcome, this, led, to, his, engagement, with, the, philosophical, programs, of, fichte, and, schelling, as, well, as, his, attention, to, spinoza, and, the, pantheism, controversy, the, influence, of, johann, gottfried, von, herder, however, would, lead, hegel, to, a, qualified, rejection, of, the, universality, claimed, by, the, kantian, program, in, favor, of, a, more, culturally, linguistically, and, historically, informed, account, of, reason, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, was, published, in, 1807, this, is, the, first, time, that, at, the, age, of, thirty, six, hegel, lays, out, his, own, distinctive, approach, and, adopts, an, outlook, that, is, recognizably, hegelian, to, the, philosophical, problems, of, post, kantian, philosophy, yet, the, book, was, poorly, understood, even, by, hegel, s, contemporaries, and, received, mostly, negative, reviews, to, this, day, the, phenomenology, is, infamous, for, among, other, things, its, conceptual, and, allusive, density, idiosyncratic, terminology, and, confusing, transitions, its, most, comprehensive, commentary, scholar, h, s, harris, s, two, volume, hegel, s, ladder, the, pilgrimage, of, reason, and, the, odyssey, of, spirit, runs, more, than, three, times, the, length, of, the, text, itself, the, fourth, chapter, of, the, phenomenology, includes, hegel, s, first, presentation, of, the, lord, bondsman, dialectic, the, section, of, the, book, that, has, been, most, influential, in, general, culture, what, is, at, stake, in, the, conflict, hegel, presents, is, the, practical, not, theoretical, recognition, or, acknowledgement, of, the, universality, i, e, personhood, humanity, of, each, of, two, opposed, self, consciousnesses, what, the, readers, learn, but, what, the, self, consciousnesses, described, do, not, yet, realize, is, that, recognition, can, only, be, successful, and, actual, as, reciprocal, or, mutual, this, is, the, case, for, the, simple, reason, that, the, recognition, of, someone, you, do, not, recognize, as, properly, human, cannot, count, as, genuine, recognition, hegel, can, also, be, seen, here, as, criticizing, the, individualist, worldview, of, people, and, society, as, a, collection, of, atomized, individuals, instead, taking, a, holistic, view, of, human, self, consciousness, as, requiring, the, recognition, of, others, and, people, s, view, of, themselves, as, being, shaped, by, the, views, of, others, hegel, describes, the, phenomenology, as, both, the, introduction, to, his, philosophical, system, and, also, as, the, first, part, of, that, system, as, the, science, of, the, experience, of, consciousness, yet, it, has, long, been, controversial, in, both, respects, indeed, hegel, s, own, attitude, changed, throughout, his, life, nevertheless, however, complicated, the, details, the, basic, strategy, by, which, it, attempts, to, make, good, on, its, introductory, claim, is, not, difficult, to, state, beginning, with, only, the, most, basic, certainties, of, consciousness, itself, the, most, immediate, of, which, is, the, certainty, that, i, am, conscious, of, this, object, here, and, now, hegel, aims, to, show, that, these, certainties, of, natural, consciousness, have, as, their, consequence, the, standpoint, of, speculative, logic, this, does, not, however, make, the, phenomenology, a, bildungsroman, it, is, not, the, consciousness, under, observation, that, learns, from, its, experience, only, we, the, phenomenological, observers, are, in, a, position, to, profit, from, hegel, s, logical, reconstruction, of, the, science, of, experience, the, ensuing, dialectic, is, long, and, hard, it, is, described, by, hegel, himself, as, a, path, of, despair, in, which, self, consciousness, finds, itself, to, be, over, and, again, in, error, it, is, the, self, concept, of, consciousness, itself, that, is, tested, in, the, domain, of, experience, and, where, that, concept, is, not, adequate, self, consciousness, suffers, this, violence, at, its, own, hands, and, brings, to, ruin, its, own, restricted, satisfaction, for, as, hegel, points, out, one, cannot, learn, how, to, swim, without, getting, into, the, water, by, progressively, testing, its, concept, of, knowledge, in, this, way, by, making, experience, his, standard, of, knowledge, hegel, is, embarking, upon, nothing, less, than, a, transcendental, deduction, of, metaphysics, in, the, course, of, its, dialectic, the, phenomenology, purports, to, demonstrate, that, because, consciousness, always, includes, self, consciousness, there, are, no, given, objects, of, direct, awareness, not, already, mediated, by, thought, further, analysis, of, the, structure, of, self, consciousness, reveals, that, both, the, social, and, conceptual, stability, of, the, experiential, world, depend, upon, networks, of, reciprocal, recognition, failures, of, recognition, then, demand, reflection, upon, the, past, as, a, way, to, understand, what, is, required, of, us, at, the, present, for, hegel, this, ultimately, involves, rethinking, an, interpretation, of, religion, as, the, collective, reflection, of, the, modern, community, on, what, ultimately, counts, for, it, he, contends, finally, that, this, historically, socially, construed, philosophical, account, of, that, whole, process, elucidates, the, genesis, of, a, distinctly, modern, standpoint, another, way, of, putting, this, is, to, say, that, the, phenomenology, takes, up, kant, s, philosophical, project, of, investigating, the, capacities, and, limits, of, reason, under, the, influence, of, herder, however, hegel, proceeds, historically, instead, of, altogether, a, priori, yet, although, proceeding, historically, hegel, resists, the, relativistic, consequences, of, herder, s, own, thought, in, the, words, of, one, scholar, it, is, hegel, s, insight, that, reason, itself, has, a, history, that, what, counts, as, reason, is, the, result, of, a, development, this, is, something, that, kant, never, imagines, and, that, herder, only, glimpses, in, praise, of, hegel, s, accomplishment, walter, kaufmann, writes, that, the, guiding, conviction, of, the, phenomenology, is, that, a, philosopher, should, not, confine, him, or, herself, to, views, that, have, been, held, but, penetrate, these, to, the, human, reality, they, reflect, in, other, words, it, is, not, enough, to, consider, propositions, or, even, the, content, of, consciousness, it, is, worthwhile, to, ask, in, every, instance, what, kind, of, spirit, would, entertain, such, propositions, hold, such, views, and, have, such, a, consciousness, every, outlook, in, other, words, is, to, be, studied, not, merely, as, an, academic, possibility, but, as, an, existential, reality, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, shows, that, the, search, for, an, externally, objective, criterion, of, truth, is, a, fool, s, errand, the, constraints, on, knowledge, are, necessarily, internal, to, spirit, itself, yet, although, theories, and, self, conceptions, may, always, be, reevaluated, renegotiated, and, revised, this, is, not, a, merely, imaginative, exercise, claims, to, knowledge, must, always, prove, their, own, adequacy, in, real, historical, experience, although, hegel, seemed, during, his, berlin, years, to, have, abandoned, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, at, the, time, of, his, unexpected, death, he, was, in, fact, making, plans, to, revise, and, republish, it, as, hegel, was, no, longer, in, need, of, money, or, credentials, h, s, harris, argues, that, the, only, rational, conclusion, that, can, be, drawn, from, his, decision, to, republish, the, book, is, that, he, still, regarded, the, science, of, experience, as, a, valid, project, in, itself, and, one, for, which, later, system, has, no, equivalent, there, is, however, no, scholarly, consensus, about, the, phenomenology, with, respect, to, either, of, the, systematic, roles, asserted, by, hegel, at, the, time, of, its, publication, hegel, s, philosophical, system, is, divided, into, three, parts, the, science, of, logic, the, philosophy, of, nature, and, the, philosophy, of, spirit, the, latter, two, of, which, together, constitute, the, real, philosophy, this, structure, is, adopted, from, proclus, s, neoplatonic, triad, of, remaining, procession, return, and, from, the, christian, trinity, although, evident, in, draft, writings, dating, back, as, early, as, 1805, the, system, was, not, completed, in, published, form, until, the, 1817, encyclopedia, 1st, ed, frederick, c, beiser, argues, that, the, position, of, the, logic, with, respect, to, the, real, philosophy, is, best, understood, in, terms, of, hegel, s, appropriation, of, aristotle, s, distinction, between, the, order, of, explanation, and, the, order, of, being, to, beiser, hegel, is, neither, a, platonist, who, believes, in, abstract, logical, entities, nor, a, nominalist, according, to, whom, the, particular, is, first, in, the, orders, of, explanation, and, being, alike, rather, hegel, is, a, holist, for, hegel, the, universal, is, always, first, in, the, order, of, explanation, even, if, what, is, naturally, particular, is, first, in, the, order, of, being, with, respect, to, the, system, as, a, whole, that, universal, is, supplied, by, the, logic, michael, j, inwood, states, the, logical, idea, is, non, temporal, and, therefore, does, not, exist, at, any, time, apart, from, its, manifestations, to, ask, when, it, divides, into, nature, and, spirit, is, analogous, to, asking, when, 12, divides, into, 5, and, 7, the, question, does, not, have, an, answer, because, it, is, predicated, upon, a, fundamental, misunderstanding, of, its, terms, the, task, of, the, logic, at, this, high, systemic, level, is, to, articulate, what, hegel, calls, the, identity, of, identity, and, non, identity, of, nature, and, spirit, put, another, way, it, aims, to, overcome, subject, object, dualism, this, is, to, say, that, among, other, things, hegel, s, philosophical, project, endeavors, to, provide, the, metaphysical, basis, for, an, account, of, spirit, that, is, continuous, with, yet, distinct, from, the, merely, natural, world, without, thereby, reducing, either, term, to, the, other, furthermore, the, final, sections, of, hegel, s, encyclopedia, suggest, that, to, give, priority, to, any, one, of, its, three, parts, is, to, have, an, interpretation, that, is, one, sided, incomplete, or, otherwise, inaccurate, as, hegel, famously, declares, the, true, is, the, whole, hegel, s, concept, of, logic, differs, greatly, from, that, of, the, ordinary, english, sense, of, the, term, this, can, be, seen, for, instance, in, such, metaphysical, definitions, of, logic, as, the, science, of, things, grasped, in, thoughts, that, used, to, be, taken, to, express, the, essentialities, of, the, things, as, michael, wolff, explains, hegel, s, logic, is, a, continuation, of, kant, s, distinctive, logical, program, its, occasional, engagement, with, the, familiar, aristotelian, conception, of, logic, is, only, incidental, to, hegel, s, project, twentieth, century, developments, by, such, logicians, as, frege, and, russell, likewise, remain, logics, of, formal, validity, and, so, are, likewise, irrelevant, to, hegel, s, project, which, aspires, to, provide, a, metaphysical, logic, of, truth, there, are, two, texts, of, hegel, s, logic, the, first, the, science, of, logic, 1812, 1813, 1816, bk, i, revised, 1831, is, sometimes, also, called, the, greater, logic, the, second, is, the, first, volume, of, hegel, s, encyclopedia, and, is, sometimes, known, as, the, lesser, logic, the, encyclopedia, logic, is, an, abbreviated, or, condensed, presentation, of, the, same, dialectic, hegel, composed, it, for, use, with, students, in, the, lecture, hall, not, as, a, substitute, for, its, proper, book, length, exposition, hegel, presents, logic, as, a, presuppositionless, science, that, investigates, the, most, fundamental, thought, determinations, or, categories, and, so, constitutes, the, basis, of, philosophy, in, putting, something, into, question, one, already, presupposes, logic, in, this, regard, it, is, the, only, field, of, inquiry, that, must, constantly, reflect, upon, its, own, mode, of, functioning, the, science, of, logic, is, hegel, s, attempt, to, meet, this, foundational, demand, as, he, puts, it, logic, coincides, with, metaphysics, in, the, words, of, scholar, glenn, alexander, magee, the, logic, provides, an, account, of, pure, categories, or, ideas, which, are, timelessly, true, and, which, make, up, the, formal, structure, of, reality, itself, it, is, important, to, see, however, that, hegel, s, metaphysical, program, is, not, a, return, to, the, leibnizian, wolffian, rationalism, critiqued, by, kant, which, is, a, criticism, hegel, accepts, in, particular, hegel, rejects, any, form, of, metaphysics, as, speculation, about, the, transcendent, his, procedure, an, appropriation, of, aristotle, s, concept, of, form, is, fully, immanent, more, generally, hegel, agrees, wholeheartedly, with, kant, s, rejection, of, all, forms, of, dogmatism, and, also, agrees, that, any, future, metaphysics, must, pass, the, test, of, criticism, it, is, the, assessment, of, scholar, stephen, houlgate, that, hegel, s, method, of, immanent, logical, development, and, critique, is, historically, unique, philosopher, b, atrice, longuenesse, holds, that, this, project, may, be, understood, on, analogy, to, kant, as, inseparably, a, metaphysical, and, a, transcendental, deduction, of, the, categories, of, metaphysics, this, approach, insists, and, claims, to, demonstrate, that, the, insights, of, logic, cannot, be, judged, by, standards, external, to, thought, itself, that, is, that, thought, is, not, the, mirror, of, nature, yet, she, argues, this, does, not, imply, that, these, standards, are, arbitrary, or, subjective, hegel, s, translator, and, scholar, of, german, idealism, george, di, giovanni, likewise, interprets, the, logic, as, drawing, upon, yet, also, in, opposition, to, kant, immanently, transcendental, its, categories, according, to, hegel, are, built, into, life, itself, and, define, what, it, is, to, be, an, object, in, general, books, one, and, two, of, the, logic, are, the, doctrines, of, being, and, essence, together, they, comprise, the, objective, logic, which, is, largely, occupied, with, overcoming, the, assumptions, of, traditional, metaphysics, book, three, is, the, final, part, of, the, logic, it, discusses, the, doctrine, of, the, concept, which, is, concerned, with, reintegrating, those, categories, of, objectivity, into, a, thoroughly, idealistic, account, of, reality, simplifying, greatly, being, describes, its, concepts, just, as, they, appear, essence, attempts, to, explain, them, with, reference, to, other, forces, and, the, concept, explains, and, unites, them, both, in, terms, of, an, internal, teleology, the, categories, of, being, pass, over, from, one, to, the, next, as, denoting, thought, determinations, only, extrinsically, connected, to, one, another, the, categories, of, essence, reciprocally, shine, into, one, another, finally, in, the, concept, thought, has, shown, itself, to, be, fully, self, referential, and, so, its, categories, organically, develop, from, one, to, the, next, it, is, clear, then, that, in, hegel, s, technical, sense, of, the, term, the, concept, begriff, sometimes, also, rendered, notion, capitalized, by, some, translators, but, not, others, is, not, a, psychological, concept, when, deployed, with, the, definitive, article, the, and, sometimes, modified, by, the, term, logical, hegel, is, referring, to, the, intelligible, structure, of, reality, as, articulated, in, the, subjective, logic, when, used, in, the, plural, however, hegel, s, sense, is, much, closer, to, the, ordinary, dictionary, sense, of, the, term, hegel, s, inquiry, into, thought, is, concerned, to, systematize, thought, s, own, internal, self, differentiation, that, is, how, pure, concepts, logical, categories, differ, from, one, another, in, their, various, relations, of, implication, and, interdependence, for, instance, in, the, opening, dialectic, of, the, logic, hegel, claims, to, display, that, the, thought, of, being, pure, being, without, further, determination, is, indistinguishable, from, the, concept, of, nothing, and, that, in, this, passing, back, and, forth, of, being, and, nothing, each, immediately, vanishes, in, its, opposite, this, movement, is, neither, one, concept, nor, the, other, but, the, category, of, becoming, there, is, not, a, difference, here, to, which, one, can, refer, only, a, dialectic, that, one, can, observe, and, describe, the, final, category, of, the, logic, is, the, idea, as, with, the, concept, the, sense, of, this, term, for, hegel, is, not, psychological, rather, following, kant, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, hegel, s, usage, harks, back, to, the, greek, eidos, plato, s, concept, of, form, that, is, fully, existent, and, universal, hegel, s, idee, like, plato, s, idea, is, the, product, of, an, attempt, to, fuse, ontology, epistemology, evaluation, etc, into, a, single, set, of, concepts, the, logic, accommodates, within, itself, the, necessity, of, the, realm, of, natural, spiritual, contingency, that, which, cannot, be, determined, in, advance, to, go, further, it, must, abandon, thinking, altogether, and, let, itself, go, opening, itself, to, that, which, is, other, than, thought, in, pure, receptivity, simply, put, logic, realizes, itself, only, in, the, domain, of, nature, and, spirit, in, which, it, attains, its, verification, hence, the, conclusion, of, the, science, of, logic, with, the, idea, freely, discharging, itself, into, objectivity, and, external, life, and, so, too, the, systematic, transition, to, the, realphilosophie, in, contrast, to, the, first, logical, part, of, hegel, s, system, the, second, real, philosophical, part, the, philosophy, of, nature, and, of, spirit, is, an, ongoing, project, with, respect, to, its, historical, content, which, continues, to, change, and, develop, for, instance, although, hegel, regards, the, basic, structure, of, the, philosophy, of, nature, as, complete, he, was, aware, that, science, is, not, finished, and, will, continue, to, make, new, discoveries, philosophy, is, as, hegel, puts, it, its, own, time, comprehended, in, thoughts, he, expands, upon, this, definition, a, further, word, on, the, subject, of, issuing, instructions, on, how, the, world, ought, to, be, philosophy, at, any, rate, always, comes, too, late, to, perform, this, function, as, the, thought, of, the, world, it, appears, only, at, a, time, when, actuality, has, gone, through, its, formative, process, and, attained, its, completed, state, this, lesson, of, the, concept, is, necessarily, also, apparent, from, history, namely, that, it, is, only, when, actuality, has, reached, maturity, that, the, ideal, appears, opposite, the, real, and, reconstructs, this, real, world, which, it, has, grasped, in, its, substance, in, the, shape, of, an, intellectual, realm, when, philosophy, paints, its, gray, in, gray, a, shape, of, life, has, grown, old, and, it, cannot, be, rejuvenated, but, only, recognized, by, the, gray, in, gray, of, philosophy, the, owl, of, minerva, begins, its, flight, only, with, the, onset, of, dusk, this, frequently, has, been, read, as, an, expression, of, the, impotence, of, philosophy, political, or, otherwise, and, a, rationalization, of, the, status, quo, allegra, de, laurentiis, however, points, out, that, the, german, expression, sich, fertig, machen, translated, as, getting, ready, or, to, get, ready, does, not, only, imply, completion, but, also, preparedness, this, additional, meaning, is, important, because, it, better, reflects, hegel, s, aristotelian, concept, of, actuality, he, characterizes, actuality, as, being, at, work, staying, itself, that, can, never, be, once, and, for, all, completed, or, finished, hegel, describes, the, relationship, between, the, logical, and, the, real, philosophical, parts, of, his, system, in, this, way, if, philosophy, does, not, stand, above, its, time, in, content, it, does, so, in, form, because, as, the, thought, and, knowledge, of, that, which, is, the, substantial, spirit, of, its, time, it, makes, that, spirit, its, object, this, is, to, say, that, what, makes, the, philosophy, of, the, real, scientific, in, hegel, s, technical, sense, is, the, systematically, coherent, logical, form, it, uncovers, in, its, natural, historical, material, and, so, also, displays, in, its, presentation, the, philosophy, of, nature, organizes, the, contingent, material, of, the, natural, sciences, systematically, as, part, of, the, philosophy, of, the, real, in, no, way, does, it, presume, to, tell, nature, what, it, must, be, like, historically, various, interpreters, have, questioned, hegel, s, understanding, of, the, natural, sciences, of, his, time, however, this, claim, has, been, largely, refuted, by, recent, scholarship, one, of, the, very, few, ways, in, which, the, philosophy, of, nature, might, correct, claims, made, by, the, natural, sciences, themselves, is, to, combat, reductive, explanations, that, is, to, discredit, accounts, employing, categories, not, adequate, to, the, complexity, of, the, phenomena, they, purport, to, explain, as, for, instance, attempting, to, explain, life, in, strictly, chemical, terms, although, hegel, and, other, naturphilosophen, aim, to, revive, a, teleological, understanding, of, nature, they, argue, that, their, strictly, internal, or, immanent, concept, of, teleology, is, limited, to, the, ends, observable, within, nature, itself, hence, they, claim, it, does, not, violate, the, kantian, critique, even, more, strongly, hegel, and, schelling, claim, that, kant, s, restriction, of, teleology, to, regulative, status, effectively, undermines, his, own, critical, project, of, explaining, the, possibility, of, knowledge, their, argument, is, that, only, under, the, assumption, that, there, is, an, organism, is, it, possible, to, explain, the, actual, interaction, between, the, subjective, and, the, objective, the, ideal, and, the, real, hence, the, organism, must, be, acknowledged, to, have, constitutive, status, introducing, hegel, s, philosophy, of, nature, for, a, 21st, century, audience, dieter, wandschneider, observes, that, contemporary, philosophy, of, science, has, lost, sight, of, the, ontological, issue, at, stake, namely, the, question, of, an, intrinsically, lawful, nature, consider, for, example, the, problem, of, what, constitutes, a, law, of, nature, this, problem, is, central, to, our, understanding, of, nature, yet, philosophy, of, science, has, not, provided, a, definitive, response, to, it, up, to, now, nor, can, we, expect, to, have, such, an, answer, from, that, quarter, in, future, it, is, back, to, hegel, that, wandschneider, would, direct, philosophers, of, science, for, guidance, in, the, philosophy, of, nature, recent, scholars, have, also, argued, that, hegel, s, approach, to, the, philosophy, of, nature, provides, valuable, resources, for, theorizing, and, confronting, recent, environmental, challenges, entirely, unforeseen, by, hegel, these, philosophers, point, to, such, aspects, of, his, philosophy, as, its, distinctive, metaphysical, grounding, and, the, continuity, of, its, conception, of, the, nature, spirit, relationship, the, german, geist, has, a, wide, range, of, meanings, in, its, most, general, hegelian, sense, however, geist, denotes, the, human, mind, and, its, products, in, contrast, to, nature, and, also, the, logical, idea, some, older, translations, render, it, as, mind, rather, than, spirit, as, is, especially, evident, in, the, anthropology, hegel, s, concept, of, spirit, is, an, appropriation, and, transformation, of, the, self, referential, aristotelian, concept, of, energeia, spirit, is, not, something, above, or, otherwise, external, to, nature, it, is, the, highest, organization, and, development, of, nature, s, powers, according, to, hegel, the, essence, of, spirit, is, freedom, the, encyclopedia, philosophy, of, spirit, charts, the, progressively, determinate, stages, of, this, freedom, until, spirit, fulfills, the, delphic, imperative, with, which, hegel, begins, know, thyself, as, becomes, clear, hegel, s, concept, of, freedom, is, not, or, not, merely, the, capacity, for, arbitrary, choice, but, has, as, its, core, notion, that, something, especially, a, person, is, free, if, and, only, if, it, is, independent, and, self, determining, not, determined, by, or, dependent, upon, something, other, than, itself, it, is, in, other, words, at, least, predominantly, dialectically, an, account, of, what, isaiah, berlin, would, later, term, positive, liberty, standing, at, the, transition, from, nature, to, spirit, the, role, of, the, philosophy, of, subjective, spirit, is, to, analyze, the, elements, necessary, for, or, presupposed, by, such, relations, namely, the, structures, characteristic, of, and, necessary, to, the, individual, rational, agent, it, does, this, by, elaborating, the, fundamental, nature, of, the, biological, spiritual, human, individual, along, with, the, cognitive, and, the, practical, prerequisites, of, human, social, interaction, this, section, particularly, its, first, part, contains, various, comments, that, were, commonplace, in, hegel, s, day, and, can, now, be, recognized, as, openly, racist, such, as, unfounded, claims, about, the, naturally, lower, intellectual, and, emotional, development, of, black, people, in, his, perspective, these, racial, differences, are, related, to, climate, according, to, hegel, it, is, not, racial, characteristics, but, the, climactic, conditions, in, which, a, people, lives, that, variously, limit, or, enable, its, capacity, for, free, self, determination, he, believes, that, race, is, not, destiny, any, group, could, in, principle, improve, and, transform, its, condition, by, migrating, to, friendlier, climes, hegel, divides, his, philosophy, of, the, subjective, spirit, into, three, parts, anthropology, phenomenology, and, psychology, anthropology, deals, with, soul, which, is, spirit, still, mired, in, nature, all, that, within, us, which, precedes, our, self, conscious, mind, or, intellect, in, the, section, phenomenology, hegel, examines, the, relation, between, consciousness, and, its, object, and, the, emergence, of, intersubjective, rationality, psychology, deals, with, a, great, deal, that, would, be, categorized, as, epistemology, or, theory, of, knowledge, today, hegel, discusses, among, other, things, the, nature, of, attention, memory, imagination, and, judgement, throughout, this, section, but, especially, in, the, anthropology, hegel, appropriates, and, develops, aristotle, s, hylomorphic, approach, to, what, is, today, theorized, as, the, mind, body, problem, the, solution, to, the, mind, body, problem, hinges, upon, recognizing, that, mind, does, not, act, upon, the, body, as, cause, of, effects, but, rather, acts, upon, itself, as, an, embodied, living, subjectivity, as, such, mind, develops, itself, progressively, attaining, more, and, more, of, a, self, determined, character, its, final, section, free, spirit, develops, the, concept, of, free, will, which, is, foundational, for, hegel, s, philosophy, of, right, in, the, broadest, terms, hegel, s, philosophy, of, objective, spirit, is, his, social, philosophy, his, philosophy, of, how, the, human, spirit, objectifies, itself, in, its, social, and, historical, activities, and, productions, or, put, differently, it, is, an, account, of, the, institutionalization, of, freedom, besier, declares, this, a, rare, instance, of, unanimity, in, hegel, scholarship, all, scholars, agree, there, is, no, more, important, concept, in, hegel, s, political, theory, than, freedom, this, is, because, it, is, the, foundation, of, right, the, essence, of, spirit, and, the, telos, of, history, this, part, of, hegel, s, philosophy, is, presented, first, in, his, 1817, encyclopedia, revised, 1827, and, 1830, and, then, at, greater, length, in, the, 1821, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, right, or, natural, law, and, political, science, in, outline, like, the, encyclopedia, intended, as, a, textbook, upon, which, he, also, frequently, lectured, its, final, part, the, philosophy, of, world, history, was, additionally, elaborated, in, hegel, s, lectures, on, the, subject, hegel, s, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, right, has, been, controversial, from, the, date, of, its, original, publication, it, is, not, however, a, straightforward, defense, of, the, autocratic, prussian, state, as, some, have, alleged, but, is, rather, a, defense, of, prussia, as, it, was, to, have, become, under, reform, administrations, the, german, recht, in, hegel, s, title, does, not, have, a, direct, english, equivalent, though, it, does, correspond, to, the, latin, ius, and, the, french, droit, as, a, first, approximation, michael, inwood, distinguishes, three, senses, beiser, observes, that, hegel, s, theory, is, his, attempt, to, rehabilitate, the, natural, law, tradition, while, taking, into, account, the, criticisms, of, the, historical, school, he, adds, that, without, a, sound, interpretation, of, hegel, s, theory, of, natural, law, we, have, very, little, understanding, of, the, very, foundation, of, his, social, and, political, thought, consistent, with, beiser, s, position, adriaan, t, peperzak, documents, hegel, s, arguments, against, social, contract, theory, and, stresses, the, metaphysical, foundations, of, hegel, s, philosophy, of, right, observing, that, analyzing, the, structure, of, hegel, s, argument, in, the, philosophy, of, right, shows, that, achieving, political, autonomy, is, fundamental, to, hegel, s, analysis, of, the, state, and, government, kenneth, r, westphal, provides, this, brief, outline, hegel, describes, the, state, of, his, time, a, constitutional, monarchy, as, rationally, embodying, three, cooperative, and, mutually, inclusive, elements, these, elements, are, democracy, rule, of, the, many, who, are, involved, in, legislation, aristocracy, rule, of, the, few, who, apply, concretize, and, execute, the, laws, and, monarchy, rule, of, the, one, who, heads, and, encompasses, all, power, it, is, what, aristotle, called, a, mixed, form, of, government, which, is, designed, to, include, what, is, best, of, each, of, the, three, classical, forms, the, division, of, powers, prevents, an, single, power, from, dominating, others, hegel, is, particularly, concerned, to, bind, the, monarch, to, the, constitution, limiting, his, authority, so, that, he, can, do, little, more, than, to, declare, of, what, his, ministers, have, already, decided, that, it, is, to, be, so, the, relation, of, hegel, s, philosophy, of, right, to, modern, liberalism, is, complex, he, sees, liberalism, as, a, valuable, and, characteristic, expression, of, the, modern, world, however, it, carries, the, danger, within, itself, to, undermine, its, own, values, this, self, destructive, tendency, may, be, avoided, by, measuring, the, subjective, goals, of, individuals, by, a, larger, objective, and, collective, good, moral, values, then, have, only, a, limited, place, in, the, total, scheme, of, things, yet, although, it, is, not, without, reason, that, hegel, is, widely, regarded, as, a, major, proponent, of, what, isaiah, berlin, would, later, term, positive, liberty, he, was, just, as, unwavering, and, unequivocal, in, his, defense, of, negative, liberty, if, hegel, s, ideal, sovereign, is, much, weaker, than, was, typical, in, monarchies, his, time, so, too, is, his, democratic, element, much, weaker, than, is, typical, in, democracies, of, modern, times, although, he, insists, upon, the, importance, of, public, participation, hegel, severely, limits, suffrage, and, follows, the, english, bicameral, model, in, which, only, members, of, the, lower, house, that, of, commoners, and, bourgeoisie, are, elected, officials, nobles, in, the, upper, house, like, the, monarch, inherit, their, positions, the, final, part, of, the, philosophy, of, objective, spirit, is, entitled, world, history, in, this, section, hegel, argues, that, this, immanent, principle, produces, with, logical, inevitability, an, expansion, of, the, species, capacities, for, self, determination, freedom, and, a, deepening, of, its, self, understanding, self, knowing, in, hegel, s, own, words, world, history, is, progress, in, the, consciousness, of, freedom, a, progress, that, we, must, comprehend, conceptually, see, also, legacy, below, for, further, discussion, of, the, complex, legacy, of, hegel, s, social, and, political, philosophy, hegel, s, use, of, the, term, absolute, is, easily, misunderstood, inwood, however, clarifies, derived, from, the, latin, absolutus, it, means, not, dependent, on, conditional, on, relative, to, or, restricted, by, anything, else, self, contained, perfect, complete, for, hegel, this, means, that, absolute, knowing, can, only, denote, an, absolute, relation, in, which, the, ground, of, experience, and, the, experiencing, agent, are, one, and, the, same, the, object, known, is, explicitly, the, subject, who, knows, that, is, the, only, thing, which, is, really, an, activity, that, is, truly, absolute, is, that, which, is, entirely, self, conditioned, and, according, to, hegel, this, only, occurs, when, spirit, takes, itself, up, as, its, own, object, the, final, section, of, his, philosophy, of, spirit, presents, the, three, modes, of, such, absolute, knowing, art, religion, and, philosophy, it, is, with, reference, to, different, modalities, of, consciousness, intuition, representation, and, comprehending, thinking, that, hegel, distinguishes, the, three, modes, of, absolute, knowing, frederick, beiser, summarizes, art, religion, and, philosophy, all, have, the, same, object, the, absolute, or, truth, itself, but, they, consist, in, different, forms, of, knowledge, of, it, art, presents, the, absolute, in, the, form, of, immediate, intuition, anschauung, religion, presents, it, in, the, form, of, representation, vorstellung, and, philosophy, presents, it, in, the, form, of, concepts, begriffe, r, diger, bubner, additionally, clarifies, that, the, increase, in, conceptual, transparency, according, to, which, these, spheres, are, systematically, ordered, is, not, hierarchical, in, any, evaluative, sense, although, hegel, s, discussion, of, absolute, spirit, in, the, encyclopedia, is, quite, brief, he, develops, his, account, at, length, in, lectures, on, the, philosophy, of, fine, art, the, philosophy, of, religion, and, the, history, of, philosophy, in, the, phenomenology, and, even, in, the, 1817, edition, of, the, encyclopedia, hegel, discusses, art, only, as, it, figures, in, what, he, terms, the, art, religion, of, the, ancient, greeks, in, 1818, however, hegel, begins, lecturing, on, the, philosophy, of, art, as, an, explicitly, autonomous, domain, although, h, g, hotho, titled, his, edition, of, the, lectures, vorlesungen, ber, die, sthetik, hegel, directly, states, that, his, topic, is, not, the, spacious, realm, of, the, beautiful, but, art, or, rather, fine, art, he, doubles, down, on, this, in, the, next, paragraph, by, explicitly, distinguishing, his, project, from, the, broader, philosophical, projects, pursued, under, the, heading, of, aesthetics, by, christian, wolff, and, alexander, gottlieb, baumgarten, some, critics, most, canonically, benedetto, croce, in, 1907, have, attributed, to, hegel, some, form, of, the, thesis, that, art, is, dead, hegel, however, never, said, any, such, thing, nor, can, such, a, view, be, plausibly, attributed, to, him, indeed, one, commentator, places, that, debate, in, perspective, with, the, observation, that, hegel, s, claim, that, art, no, longer, serves, our, highest, aims, is, radical, not, for, the, suggestion, that, art, now, fails, to, do, so, but, for, the, suggestion, that, it, ever, did, hegel, s, detailed, and, systematic, treatment, of, the, various, arts, over, such, a, great, span, has, even, led, ernst, gombrich, to, present, hegel, as, the, father, of, art, history, indeed, until, recently, hegel, s, lectures, were, largely, ignored, by, philosophers, and, received, most, of, their, attention, from, literary, critics, and, art, historians, the, more, narrowly, conceptual, project, of, the, philosophy, of, art, however, is, to, articulate, and, defend, the, autonomy, of, art, making, possible, an, account, of, the, special, individuality, distinguishing, works, of, aesthetic, worth, according, to, hegel, artistic, beauty, reveals, absolute, truth, through, perception, he, holds, that, the, best, art, conveys, metaphysical, knowledge, by, revealing, through, sense, perception, what, is, unconditionally, true, that, is, what, his, metaphysical, theory, affirms, to, be, unconditional, or, absolute, so, while, hegel, ennobles, art, insofar, as, it, conveys, metaphysical, knowledge, he, tempers, his, assessment, in, view, of, his, belief, that, art, s, sensory, media, can, never, adequately, convey, what, completely, transcends, the, contingency, of, sensation, this, is, why, according, to, hegel, art, can, only, be, one, of, three, mutually, complementary, modes, of, absolute, spirit, although, his, understanding, of, christianity, evolved, over, time, hegel, identified, as, a, lutheran, his, entire, life, one, constant, was, his, profound, appreciation, for, the, christian, insight, into, the, intrinsic, worth, and, freedom, of, every, individual, hegel, s, earliest, writings, on, christianity, date, between, 1783, and, 1800, he, was, still, working, out, his, ideas, at, this, time, and, everything, from, this, period, was, abandoned, as, fragments, or, unfinished, drafts, hegel, was, very, much, dissatisfied, with, the, dogmatism, and, positivity, of, the, christian, religion, to, which, he, opposed, the, spontaneous, religion, of, the, greeks, in, the, spirit, of, christianity, he, proposes, a, sort, of, resolution, by, aligning, the, universality, of, kantian, moral, philosophy, with, the, universality, of, the, teachings, of, jesus, in, paraphrase, the, moral, principle, of, the, gospel, is, charity, or, love, and, love, is, the, beauty, of, the, heart, a, spiritual, beauty, which, combines, the, greek, soul, and, kant, s, moral, reason, although, he, did, not, return, to, this, romantic, formulation, the, unification, of, greek, and, christian, thought, would, remain, a, preoccupation, throughout, his, life, religion, is, a, major, theme, throughout, the, 1807, phenomenology, of, spirit, well, before, it, emerges, as, the, explicit, topic, of, the, penultimate, religion, chapter, this, is, seen, most, directly, in, the, metaphysical, unhappiness, of, the, augustinian, consciousness, in, chapter, iv, and, in, hegel, s, depiction, of, the, struggle, of, the, church, of, the, faithful, with, enlightenment, philosophes, in, chapter, vi, hegel, s, proper, account, of, christianity, however, is, to, be, found, in, the, final, section, of, the, phenomenology, just, prior, to, the, closing, chapter, absolute, knowing, it, is, presented, under, the, heading, the, revelatory, religion, by, means, of, philosophical, exposition, of, christian, doctrines, such, as, incarnation, and, resurrection, hegel, claims, to, demonstrate, or, to, make, manifest, the, conceptual, truth, of, christianity, and, so, to, overcome, what, has, only, been, positively, revealed, by, explication, of, its, underlying, revelatory, truth, the, heart, of, hegel, s, interpretation, of, christianity, can, be, seen, in, his, interpretation, of, the, trinity, god, the, father, must, give, himself, existence, as, finitely, human, son, the, death, of, whom, discloses, his, essential, being, as, spirit, and, crucially, according, to, hegel, his, own, philosophical, concept, of, spirit, makes, transparent, what, is, only, obscurely, represented, in, the, christian, concept, of, the, trinity, and, so, it, makes, manifest, the, philosophical, truth, of, religion, which, now, is, known, in, an, essay, on, the, phenomenology, george, di, giovanni, contrasts, kant, s, rational, faith, with, hegel, s, rational, religion, on, his, view, the, modern, role, of, religion, consists, in, expressing, and, nurturing, spirit, in, its, most, individual, forms, rather, than, in, explaining, reality, there, is, no, longer, any, place, for, faith, in, opposition, to, knowledge, instead, faith, assumes, such, forms, as, the, trust, placed, in, individuals, close, to, us, or, in, the, time, and, place, in, which, we, happen, to, live, in, other, words, according, to, hegel, s, philosophical, interpretation, christianity, does, not, require, faith, in, any, doctrine, that, is, not, fully, justified, by, reason, what, is, left, then, is, the, religious, community, free, to, minister, to, individual, needs, and, to, celebrate, the, absolute, freedom, of, spirit, hegel, s, encyclopedia, includes, a, section, on, the, revealed, religion, but, it, is, quite, short, it, is, his, berlin, lectures, that, contain, his, next, presentation, of, christianity, which, he, variously, refers, to, as, the, consummate, absolute, or, revelatory, religion, all, equivalent, terms, in, this, context, transcripts, of, three, of, hegel, s, four, courses, have, been, preserved, and, they, show, him, to, be, continually, adjusting, his, emphases, and, exposition, the, interpretation, of, christianity, that, he, advances, however, is, still, very, much, that, which, he, presented, in, the, phenomenology, only, now, he, is, able, to, expound, at, greater, length, and, with, greater, clarity, upon, what, he, had, covered, earlier, in, such, a, condensed, fashion, walter, jaeschke, questions, whether, luther, would, have, recognized, hegel, s, claim, to, protestantism, hegel, embraces, the, doctrine, of, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, with, his, concept, of, spirit, but, rejects, the, core, lutheran, doctrines, of, sola, gratia, and, sola, scriptura, instead, he, affirms, as, the, fundamental, principle, of, protestantism, the, obstinacy, that, does, honor, to, mankind, to, refuse, to, recognize, in, conviction, anything, not, ratified, by, thought, on, similar, grounds, frederick, beiser, while, acknowledging, hegel, s, apparently, sincere, profession, of, lutheranism, describes, hegel, s, theology, as, effectively, the, very, opposite, of, luther, s, discussing, the, hegel, renaissance, in, late, 20th, century, anglo, american, philosophy, beiser, expresses, surprise, given, today, s, highly, secular, academic, culture, at, such, a, surge, of, interest, in, hegel, for, according, to, hegel, the, divine, is, the, centerpoint, of, philosophy, hegel, s, concept, of, god, differs, from, theistic, conceptions, found, in, orthodox, christianity, and, from, deistic, conceptions, suggested, by, eighteenth, century, philosophers, nonetheless, hegel, conceptualizes, god, as, the, infinite, or, absolute, in, agreement, with, the, classical, definition, given, by, st, anselm, as, that, of, which, nothing, greater, can, be, conceived, just, how, to, most, properly, characterize, hegel, s, distinctive, articulation, of, christianity, was, a, matter, of, intense, debate, even, in, his, own, life, and, among, his, students, after, his, death, so, it, is, likely, to, remain, neither, theistic, nor, deistic, hegel, s, god, can, only, be, articulated, in, the, philosophical, terms, of, the, concept, of, spirit, or, his, own, distinctive, logical, vocabulary, nevertheless, hegel, everywhere, insists, that, his, is, the, christian, god, history, frederick, beiser, writes, is, central, to, hegel, s, conception, of, philosophy, philosophy, is, only, possible, if, it, is, historical, only, if, the, philosopher, is, aware, of, the, origins, context, and, development, of, his, doctrines, in, this, 1993, essay, titled, hegel, s, historicism, beiser, declares, this, to, be, nothing, less, than, a, revolution, in, the, history, of, philosophy, in, a, 2011, monograph, however, beiser, excludes, hegel, from, his, treatment, of, the, german, historicist, tradition, for, the, reason, that, hegel, is, more, interested, in, the, philosophy, of, history, than, in, the, epistemological, project, of, justifying, its, status, as, a, science, moreover, against, the, relativistic, implications, of, historicism, narrowly, construed, hegel, s, metaphysics, of, spirit, supplies, a, telos, internal, to, history, itself, in, terms, of, which, progress, can, be, measured, and, assessed, this, is, the, self, consciousness, of, freedom, the, more, that, awareness, of, this, essential, freedom, of, spirit, permeates, a, culture, the, more, advanced, hegel, claims, it, to, be, because, freedom, according, to, hegel, is, the, essence, of, spirit, the, developing, self, awareness, of, this, is, just, as, much, a, development, in, truth, as, it, is, in, political, life, thinking, presupposes, an, instinctive, belief, in, truth, and, the, history, of, philosophy, as, recounted, by, hegel, is, a, progressive, sequence, of, system, identifying, concepts, of, truth, whether, or, not, hegel, is, a, historicist, simply, depends, upon, how, one, defines, the, term, the, importance, of, history, in, hegel, s, philosophy, however, cannot, be, denied, german, has, two, words, for, history, historie, and, geschichte, the, first, refers, to, the, narrative, organization, of, empirical, material, the, second, includes, an, account, of, the, underlying, developmental, logic, the, intrinsic, ground, of, deeds, and, events, only, the, latter, procedure, can, supply, a, properly, universal, or, philosophical, history, and, this, is, the, procedure, hegel, adopts, in, all, of, his, historical, writings, according, to, hegel, humans, are, distinctly, historical, creatures, because, not, only, do, they, exist, in, time, they, also, internalize, temporal, events, so, that, they, become, in, a, profound, sense, part, of, what, and, who, people, are, integral, to, humanity, s, self, understanding, and, self, knowledge, this, is, why, the, history, of, philosophy, for, instance, is, integral, to, philosophy, itself, it, being, literally, impossible, for, early, philosophers, to, think, what, later, philosophers, afforded, all, the, riches, of, their, predecessors, could, think, and, perhaps, with, this, distance, work, through, more, thoroughly, or, consistently, from, a, later, perspective, for, instance, it, becomes, apparent, that, the, concept, of, personhood, includes, the, implication, of, universality, such, as, renders, contradictory, any, interpretation, or, implementation, that, extends, it, to, some, people, but, not, to, others, in, the, introduction, to, his, lectures, on, the, philosophy, of, world, history, simplifying, his, own, account, hegel, divides, human, history, into, three, epochs, in, what, he, calls, the, oriental, world, one, person, the, pharaoh, or, emperor, was, free, in, the, greco, roman, world, some, people, moneyed, citizens, were, free, in, the, germanic, world, that, is, european, christendom, all, persons, are, free, in, his, discussion, of, the, ancient, world, hegel, provides, a, heavily, qualified, defense, of, slavery, as, he, puts, it, elsewhere, slavery, occurs, in, a, transitional, phase, between, the, natural, human, existence, and, the, truly, ethical, condition, it, occurs, in, a, world, where, a, wrong, is, still, right, here, the, wrong, is, valid, so, that, the, position, it, occupies, is, a, necessary, one, hegel, is, clear, however, that, there, is, an, unconditional, moral, demand, to, reject, the, institution, of, slavery, and, that, slavery, is, incompatible, with, the, rational, state, and, the, essential, freedom, of, every, individual, some, commentators, most, notably, alexandre, koj, ve, and, francis, fukuyama, have, understood, hegel, to, claim, that, having, achieved, a, fully, universal, concept, of, freedom, history, is, complete, that, it, has, reached, its, conclusion, against, this, however, it, can, be, objected, that, freedom, may, yet, be, expanded, in, terms, both, of, its, scope, and, its, content, since, hegel, s, day, the, scope, of, the, concept, of, freedom, has, been, expanded, to, acknowledge, the, rightful, inclusion, of, women, formerly, enslaved, or, colonized, peoples, the, mentally, ill, and, those, who, do, not, conform, to, conservative, norms, with, respect, to, sexual, preference, or, gender, identity, among, others, as, to, the, content, of, freedom, the, united, nations, international, bill, of, human, rights, just, for, instance, expands, the, concept, of, freedom, beyond, what, hegel, himself, articulates, additionally, although, hegel, consistently, presents, his, philosophical, histories, as, east, to, west, narratives, scholars, such, as, j, m, fritzman, argue, that, not, only, is, this, prejudice, quite, incidental, to, the, substance, of, hegel, s, philosophical, position, but, that, with, india, now, the, world, s, largest, democracy, for, instance, or, with, south, africa, s, mighty, efforts, to, transcend, apartheid, the, movement, of, freedom, back, to, the, east, may, already, have, begun, hegel, is, often, credited, with, proceeding, according, to, a, dialectical, method, in, point, of, fact, however, hegel, characterizes, his, philosophy, as, speculative, spekulativ, rather, than, dialectical, and, uses, the, term, dialectical, only, quite, rarely, this, is, because, although, dialektik, sometimes, stands, for, the, entire, movement, of, the, self, articulation, of, meaning, or, thought, this, term, refers, more, specifically, to, the, self, negation, of, the, determinations, of, the, understanding, verstand, when, they, are, thought, through, in, their, fixedness, and, opposition, by, contrast, hegel, describes, correct, thinking, as, the, methodical, interplay, of, three, moments, for, example, self, consciousness, is, the, concept, that, consciousness, has, of, itself, thus, in, this, case, concept, and, referent, coincide, self, consciousness, refers, to, mind, s, taking, on, the, self, contradictory, and, thus, also, self, negating, role, of, being, subject, and, object, of, one, and, the, same, act, of, cognition, simultaneously, and, in, the, same, respect, hence, it, is, a, speculative, concept, according, to, beiser, if, hegel, has, any, methodology, at, all, it, appears, to, be, an, anti, methodology, a, method, to, suspend, all, methods, hegel, s, term, dialectic, must, be, understood, with, reference, to, the, concept, of, the, object, of, investigation, what, must, be, grasped, is, the, self, organization, of, the, subject, matter, its, inner, necessity, and, inherent, movement, hegel, renounces, all, external, methods, such, as, could, be, applied, to, some, subject, matter, the, dialectical, character, of, hegel, s, speculative, procedure, often, makes, his, position, on, any, given, issue, quite, difficult, to, characterize, instead, of, seeking, to, answer, a, question, or, solve, a, problem, directly, he, frequently, recasts, it, by, showing, for, instance, how, the, dichotomy, underlying, the, dispute, is, false, and, that, it, is, therefore, possible, to, integrate, elements, from, both, positions, speculative, thought, preserves, what, is, true, from, apparently, opposing, theories, in, a, process, that, hegel, terms, sublation, to, sublate, aufheben, has, three, main, senses, hegel, generally, uses, the, term, in, all, three, senses, with, particular, emphasis, on, the, second, and, third, in, which, apparent, contradictions, are, speculatively, overcome, his, word, for, what, is, sublated, is, moment, das, moment, in, the, neuter, which, denotes, an, essential, feature, or, aspect, of, a, whole, conceived, as, a, static, system, and, an, essential, phase, in, a, whole, conceived, as, a, dialectical, movement, or, process, when, hegel, describes, something, as, contradictory, what, he, means, is, that, it, is, not, independently, self, sustaining, on, its, own, terms, and, so, it, can, only, be, comprehended, as, a, moment, of, a, larger, whole, according, to, hegel, to, think, of, the, finite, as, a, moment, of, the, whole, rather, than, an, independently, self, determined, existent, is, what, it, means, to, grasp, it, as, idealized, das, ideelle, idealism, then, is, the, doctrine, that, finite, entities, are, ideal, ideell, they, depend, not, on, themselves, for, their, existence, but, on, some, larger, self, sustaining, entity, that, underlies, or, embraces, them, the, pronoun, expressions, moment, sublate, and, idealize, are, characteristic, of, hegel, s, account, of, idealism, they, can, be, understood, as, stages, of, thought, in, which, the, object, is, conceptually, present, first, in, mere, adumbration, then, according, to, circumstances, both, internal, and, external, to, it, and, finally, standing, completely, on, its, own, this, phenomenological, and, conceptual, analysis, distinguishes, hegel, s, idealism, from, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, and, berkeley, s, mentalistic, idealism, in, contrast, to, those, positions, hegel, s, idealism, is, entirely, compatible, with, realism, and, non, mechanistic, naturalism, this, position, rejects, empiricism, as, an, a, priori, account, of, knowledge, but, it, is, in, no, way, opposed, to, the, philosophical, legitimacy, of, empirical, knowledge, hegel, s, idealistic, contention, which, he, claims, to, demonstrate, is, that, being, itself, is, rational, although, it, is, not, incorrect, to, refer, to, hegel, s, philosophy, as, absolute, idealism, this, moniker, was, at, the, time, more, associated, with, schelling, and, hegel, himself, is, documented, as, employing, it, with, reference, to, his, own, philosophy, only, three, times, according, to, hegel, every, philosophy, is, essentially, idealism, this, claim, is, based, on, the, assumption, which, hegel, claims, to, demonstrate, that, conceptualization, is, present, at, all, cognitive, levels, for, to, completely, deny, this, would, undermine, trust, in, the, conceptual, capacities, necessary, for, objective, knowledge, and, so, would, lead, to, total, skepticism, hence, according, to, robert, stern, hegel, s, idealism, amounts, to, a, form, of, conceptual, realism, understood, as, the, belief, that, concepts, are, part, of, the, structure, of, reality, this, terminology, largely, developed, earlier, by, fichte, was, spread, by, heinrich, moritz, chalyb, us, in, accounts, of, hegel, s, philosophy, that, have, since, been, broadly, discredited, walter, kaufmann, for, instance, reports, fichte, introduced, into, german, philosophy, the, three, step, of, thesis, antithesis, and, synthesis, using, these, three, terms, schelling, took, up, this, terminology, hegel, did, not, he, never, once, used, these, three, terms, together, to, designate, three, stages, in, an, argument, or, account, in, any, of, his, books, and, they, do, not, help, us, understand, his, phenomenology, his, logic, or, his, philosophy, of, history, they, impede, any, open, minded, comprehension, of, what, he, does, by, forcing, it, into, a, scheme, which, was, available, to, him, and, which, he, deliberately, spurned, more, modestly, it, has, been, said, that, this, account, is, only, a, partial, comprehension, that, requires, correction, what, it, gets, right, is, that, according, to, hegel, truth, emerges, from, error, in, the, course, of, historical, development, in, a, way, that, implies, a, holism, in, which, partial, truths, are, progressively, corrected, so, that, their, one, sidedness, is, overcome, what, it, distorts, is, that, such, a, description, is, possible, only, after, the, process, has, unfolded, the, thesis, and, antithesis, are, not, alien, to, one, another, inasmuch, as, there, can, be, said, to, be, such, a, dialectical, method, it, is, not, an, external, one, such, as, could, be, applied, to, some, subject, matter, similarly, stephen, houlgate, argues, that, in, whatever, limited, sense, hegel, might, be, said, to, have, a, method, it, is, a, strictly, immanent, method, that, is, it, emerges, from, thoughtful, immersion, in, the, subject, matter, itself, if, this, leads, to, dialectics, that, is, only, because, there, is, a, contradiction, in, the, object, itself, not, because, of, any, external, methodological, procedure, hegel, s, influence, on, subsequent, philosophical, developments, has, been, enormous, in, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, england, a, school, known, as, british, idealism, propounded, a, version, of, absolute, idealism, in, direct, engagement, with, hegel, s, texts, prominent, members, included, j, m, e, mctaggart, r, g, collingwood, and, g, r, g, mure, separately, some, philosophers, such, as, marx, dewey, derrida, adorno, and, gadamer, have, selectively, developed, hegelian, ideas, into, their, own, philosophical, programs, others, have, developed, their, positions, in, opposition, to, hegel, s, system, these, include, for, instance, such, diverse, philosophers, as, schopenhauer, kierkegaard, russell, g, e, moore, and, foucault, in, theology, hegel, s, influence, marks, the, work, of, karl, barth, and, dietrich, bonhoeffer, these, names, however, constitute, only, a, small, sample, of, some, of, the, more, important, figures, who, have, developed, their, thought, in, engagement, with, the, philosophy, of, hegel, some, historians, present, hegel, s, early, influence, in, germanic, philosophy, as, divided, into, two, opposing, camps, right, and, left, the, right, hegelians, the, allegedly, direct, disciples, of, hegel, at, the, friedrich, wilhelms, universit, t, advocated, a, protestant, orthodoxy, and, the, political, conservatism, of, the, post, napoleon, restoration, period, the, left, hegelians, also, known, as, the, young, hegelians, interpreted, hegel, in, a, revolutionary, sense, leading, to, an, advocation, of, atheism, in, religion, and, liberal, democracy, in, politics, recent, studies, however, have, questioned, this, paradigm, the, right, hegelians, were, quickly, forgotten, and, today, mainly, known, only, to, specialists, the, left, hegelians, by, contrast, included, some, of, the, most, important, thinkers, of, the, period, and, through, their, emphasis, on, practice, some, of, these, thinkers, have, remained, exceedingly, influential, primarily, through, the, marxist, tradition, among, the, first, followers, to, take, an, expressly, critical, view, of, hegel, s, system, were, those, in, the, 19th, century, german, group, known, as, the, young, hegelians, which, included, feuerbach, marx, engels, and, their, followers, the, primary, thrust, of, their, criticism, is, concisely, expressed, in, the, eleventh, of, marx, s, theses, on, feuerbach, from, his, 1845, german, ideology, the, philosophers, have, only, interpreted, the, world, in, various, ways, the, point, however, is, to, change, it, in, the, twentieth, century, a, hegelian, inflected, interpretation, of, marx, was, further, developed, in, the, work, of, critical, theorists, of, the, frankfurt, school, this, was, due, to, a, the, rediscovery, and, re, evaluation, of, hegel, as, a, possible, philosophical, progenitor, of, marxism, by, philosophically, oriented, marxists, b, a, resurgence, of, hegel, s, historical, perspective, and, c, an, increasing, recognition, of, the, importance, of, his, dialectical, method, gy, rgy, luk, cs, history, and, class, consciousness, 1923, in, particular, helped, to, reintroduce, hegel, into, the, marxist, canon, it, has, become, commonplace, to, identify, french, hegel, with, the, lectures, of, alexandre, koj, ve, who, emphasized, the, master, servant, dialectic, which, he, mistranslated, as, master, slave, and, hegel, s, philosophy, of, history, this, perspective, however, overlooks, over, sixty, years, of, french, writing, on, hegel, according, to, which, hegelianism, was, identified, with, the, system, presented, in, the, encyclopedia, the, later, reading, drawing, instead, upon, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, was, in, many, ways, a, reaction, against, the, earlier, after, 1945, this, dramatic, hegelianism, which, centered, on, the, theme, of, historical, becoming, through, conflict, to, be, seen, as, compatible, with, existentialism, and, marxism, by, confining, the, dialectic, to, history, the, dominant, french, readings, of, jean, wahl, alexandre, koj, ve, and, jean, hyppolite, effectively, presented, hegel, as, providing, a, philosophical, anthropology, instead, of, a, general, metaphysics, this, reading, took, the, topic, of, desire, as, its, focal, point, of, intervention, a, major, theme, was, that, a, reason, that, seeks, to, be, all, inclusive, falsifies, reality, by, suppressing, or, repressing, its, other, although, it, cannot, be, attributed, entirely, to, koj, ve, this, reading, of, hegel, shaped, the, thought, and, interpretations, of, thinkers, such, as, jean, paul, sartre, maurice, merleau, ponty, claude, levi, strauss, jacques, lacan, and, georges, bataille, koj, ve, s, interpretation, of, the, master, slave, dialectic, as, the, basic, model, of, historical, development, also, influenced, the, feminism, of, simone, de, beauvoir, and, the, anti, racist, and, anti, colonial, work, of, frantz, fanon, as, documented, by, richard, j, bernstein, the, influence, of, hegel, on, american, pragmatism, can, be, divided, into, three, moments, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, mid, twentieth, and, the, present, the, first, is, to, be, found, in, early, issues, of, the, journal, of, speculative, philosophy, founded, 1867, the, second, is, evident, in, the, acknowledged, influence, upon, major, figures, including, john, dewey, charles, peirce, and, william, james, as, dewey, himself, describes, the, attraction, there, were, however, also, subjective, reasons, for, the, appeal, that, hegel, s, thought, made, to, me, it, supplied, a, demand, for, unification, that, was, doubtless, an, intense, emotional, craving, and, yet, was, a, hunger, that, only, an, intellectualized, subject, matter, could, satisfy, dewey, accepted, much, of, hegel, s, account, of, history, and, society, but, rejected, his, conception, of, hegel, s, account, of, absolute, knowing, two, philosophers, john, mcdowell, and, robert, brandom, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, pittsburgh, hegelians, constitute, per, bernstein, the, third, moment, of, hegel, s, influence, on, pragmatism, however, while, openly, acknowledging, the, influence, neither, claims, to, explicate, hegel, s, views, according, to, his, own, self, understanding, in, addition, each, is, avowedly, influenced, by, wilfrid, sellars, mcdowell, is, particularly, interested, in, dispelling, the, myth, of, the, given, the, dichotomy, between, concept, and, intuition, whereas, brandom, is, concerned, mostly, to, develop, hegel, s, social, account, of, reason, giving, and, normative, implication, these, appropriations, of, hegel, s, thought, are, two, among, several, non, metaphysical, readings, published, articles, are, in, quotes, book, titles, are, italicized, bern, 1793, 96, frankfurt, am, main, 1797, 1800, jena, 1801, 07, bamberg, 1807, 08, nuremberg, 1808, 16, heidelberg, 1816, 18, berlin, 1818, 31, this, matters, philosophically, because, hegel, s, terms, here, are, an, appropriation, of, aristotle, s, analysis, of, the, master, servant, relation, in, his, politics, 1253a24, 1256b39, and, oeconomica, as, peperzak, puts, it, commenting, upon, the, encyclopedia, version, of, the, dialectic, hegel, likewise, emphasizes, the, mutual, benefit, and, commonality, of, the, union, between, a, free, master, and, the, animal, sapiens, who, serves, him, as, an, appropriate, organon, or, as, harris, remarks, the, master, is, the, rational, agent, and, the, slave, is, the, rational, instrument, probably, his, most, direct, discussion, of, the, vocabulary, of, natural, right, is, to, be, found, in, the, introduction, to, hegel, s, 1817, 1818, heidelberg, lectures, after, this, he, almost, always, speaks, of, right, simplicitur, or, right, as, modified, by, his, own, distinct, philosophical, terms, hegel, adopted, the, terms, positive, and, natural, from, legal, theory, where, they, indicate, the, difference, between, imperfect, human, written, secondary, positive, law, and, perfect, primary, god, given, natural, law, a, rigorous, justification, of, hegel, s, method, is, given, in, the, last, chapter, of, his, logic, gw, 12, pp, 237, 253, in, the, courses, on, the, philosophy, of, right, dialeklik, is, mentioned, e, g, in, ilt, 3, 139, dialectics, means, in, general, that, something, finite, pretends, to, be, though, it, is, not, insofar, as, it, has, its, limit, in, itself, and, wa, 273, all, that, is, limited, is, dialectical, in, itself, failure, to, see, that, hegel, does, not, stop, at, the, second, intellectual, and, negative, dialectical, stage, of, knowledge, leads, to, a, reading, that, is, more, kantian, than, hegelian, reluctance, to, recognize, that, the, oppositions, between, e, g, idea, and, nature, or, substance, and, subject, are, only, provisional, and, not, yet, fully, true, leads, to, a, misunderstanding, of, hegel, s, concepts, of, spirit, and, absolute, spirit, and, consequently, to, fundamental, distortions, of, his, theory, and, practice, of, philosophy, itself, in, ordinary, reflection, however, these, operations, function, in, isolation, once, understanding, fixes, its, terms, it, stops, thinking, and, simply, holds, to, the, distinctions, made, the, paradoxes, in, plato, s, dialogues, are, not, ultimately, resolved, and, the, modem, theory, of, categories, is, simply, a, way, of, dispelling, paradoxes, theory, construction, divorced, from, the, discipline, of, understanding, and, the, awareness, that, anomalies, develop, out, of, inherent, limitations, becomes, pure, fantasy, and, loses, its, tie, with, reality, for, hegel, rational, thinking, involves, integrating, all, three, operations, into, a, single, complex, process, of, thinking, category
