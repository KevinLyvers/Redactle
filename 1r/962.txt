college, showed, its, regard, for, cranmer, by, reinstating, his, fellowship, he, began, studying, theology, and, by, 1520, he, had, been, ordained, the, university, already, having, named, him, as, one, of, its, preachers, he, received, his, doctor, of, divinity, degree, in, 1526, not, much, is, known, about, cranmer, s, thoughts, and, experiences, during, his, three, decades, at, cambridge, traditionally, he, has, been, portrayed, as, a, humanist, whose, enthusiasm, for, biblical, scholarship, prepared, him, to, adopt, lutheran, ideas, which, were, spreading, during, the, 1520s, a, study, of, his, marginalia, reveals, an, early, antipathy, to, martin, luther, and, an, admiration, for, erasmus, when, cardinal, wolsey, the, king, s, lord, chancellor, selected, several, cambridge, scholars, including, edward, lee, stephen, gardiner, and, richard, sampson, to, be, diplomats, throughout, europe, cranmer, was, chosen, for, an, embassy, to, the, holy, roman, emperor, his, supposed, participation, in, an, earlier, embassy, to, spain, mentioned, in, the, older, literature, has, proved, to, be, spurious, henry, viii, s, first, marriage, arose, from, the, death, of, his, older, brother, arthur, in, 1502, their, father, henry, vii, betrothed, arthur, s, widow, catherine, of, aragon, to, the, future, king, the, marriage, immediately, raised, questions, about, the, biblical, prohibition, in, leviticus, 18, and, 20, against, marriage, to, a, brother, s, wife, the, couple, married, in, 1509, and, after, a, series, of, miscarriages, a, daughter, mary, was, born, in, 1516, by, the, 1520s, henry, still, did, not, have, a, son, to, name, as, heir, and, he, took, this, as, a, sure, sign, of, god, s, anger, and, made, overtures, to, the, vatican, about, an, annulment, he, gave, cardinal, wolsey, the, task, of, prosecuting, his, case, wolsey, began, by, consulting, university, experts, from, 1527, cranmer, assisted, with, the, annulment, proceedings, in, addition, to, his, duties, as, a, cambridge, don, in, mid, 1529, cranmer, stayed, with, relatives, in, waltham, holy, cross, to, avoid, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, in, cambridge, two, of, his, cambridge, associates, stephen, gardiner, and, edward, foxe, joined, him, the, three, discussed, the, annulment, issue, and, cranmer, suggested, putting, aside, the, legal, case, in, rome, in, favour, of, a, general, canvassing, of, opinions, from, university, theologians, throughout, europe, henry, showed, much, interest, in, the, idea, when, gardiner, and, foxe, presented, him, with, this, plan, it, is, unknown, whether, the, king, or, his, new, lord, chancellor, thomas, more, explicitly, approved, the, plan, eventually, it, was, implemented, and, cranmer, was, requested, to, join, the, royal, team, in, rome, to, gather, university, opinions, edward, foxe, coordinated, the, research, effort, and, the, team, produced, the, collectanea, satis, copiosa, the, sufficiently, abundant, collections, and, the, determinations, historical, and, theological, support, for, the, argument, that, the, king, exercised, supreme, jurisdiction, within, his, realm, cranmer, s, first, contact, with, a, continental, reformer, was, with, simon, grynaeus, a, humanist, based, in, basel, switzerland, and, a, follower, of, the, swiss, reformers, huldrych, zwingli, and, johannes, oecolampadius, in, mid, 1531, grynaeus, took, an, extended, visit, to, england, to, offer, himself, as, an, intermediary, between, the, king, and, the, continental, reformers, he, struck, up, a, friendship, with, cranmer, and, after, his, return, to, basel, he, wrote, about, cranmer, to, the, german, reformer, martin, bucer, in, strasbourg, grynaeus, early, contacts, initiated, cranmer, s, eventual, relationship, with, the, strasbourg, and, swiss, reformers, in, january, 1532, cranmer, was, appointed, the, resident, ambassador, at, the, court, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, as, the, emperor, travelled, throughout, his, realm, cranmer, had, to, follow, him, to, his, residence, in, regensburg, he, passed, through, the, lutheran, city, of, nuremberg, and, saw, for, the, first, time, the, effects, of, the, reformation, when, the, imperial, diet, was, moved, to, nuremberg, he, met, the, leading, architect, of, the, nuremberg, reforms, andreas, osiander, they, became, good, friends, and, during, that, july, cranmer, took, the, surprising, action, of, marrying, margarete, the, niece, of, osiander, s, wife, he, did, not, take, her, as, his, mistress, as, was, the, prevailing, custom, with, priests, for, whom, celibacy, was, too, rigorous, scholars, note, that, cranmer, had, moved, however, moderately, at, this, stage, into, identifying, with, certain, lutheran, principles, this, progress, in, his, personal, life, was, not, matched, in, his, political, life, as, he, was, unable, to, persuade, charles, catherine, s, nephew, to, support, the, annulment, of, his, aunt, s, marriage, while, cranmer, was, following, charles, through, italy, he, received, a, royal, letter, dated, 1, october, 1532, informing, him, that, he, had, been, appointed, the, new, archbishop, of, canterbury, following, the, death, of, archbishop, william, warham, cranmer, was, ordered, to, return, to, england, the, appointment, had, been, secured, by, the, family, of, anne, boleyn, who, was, being, courted, by, henry, when, cranmer, s, promotion, became, known, in, london, it, caused, great, surprise, as, cranmer, had, previously, held, only, minor, positions, in, the, church, cranmer, left, mantua, on, 19, november, and, arrived, in, england, at, the, beginning, of, january, henry, personally, financed, the, papal, bulls, necessary, for, cranmer, s, promotion, to, canterbury, the, bulls, were, easily, acquired, because, the, papal, nuncio, was, under, orders, from, rome, to, please, the, english, in, an, effort, to, prevent, a, final, breach, the, bulls, arrived, around, 26, march, 1533, and, cranmer, was, consecrated, as, a, bishop, on, 30, march, in, st, stephen, s, chapel, by, john, longland, bishop, of, lincoln, john, vesey, bishop, of, exeter, and, henry, standish, bishop, of, st, asaph, even, while, they, were, waiting, for, the, bulls, cranmer, continued, to, work, on, the, annulment, proceedings, which, required, greater, urgency, after, anne, announced, her, pregnancy, henry, and, anne, were, secretly, married, on, 24, or, 25, january, 1533, in, the, presence, of, a, handful, of, witnesses, cranmer, did, not, learn, of, the, marriage, until, 14, days, later, for, the, next, few, months, cranmer, and, the, king, worked, on, establishing, legal, procedures, on, how, the, monarch, s, marriage, would, be, judged, by, his, most, senior, clergy, several, drafts, of, the, procedures, have, been, preserved, in, letters, written, between, the, two, once, procedures, were, agreed, upon, cranmer, opened, court, sessions, on, 10, may, inviting, henry, and, catherine, of, aragon, to, appear, gardiner, represented, the, king, catherine, did, not, appear, or, send, a, proxy, on, 23, may, cranmer, pronounced, the, judgement, that, henry, s, marriage, with, catherine, was, against, the, law, of, god, he, even, issued, a, threat, of, excommunication, if, henry, did, not, stay, away, from, catherine, henry, was, now, free, to, marry, and, on, 28, may, cranmer, validated, henry, and, anne, s, marriage, on, 1, june, cranmer, personally, crowned, and, anointed, anne, queen, and, delivered, to, her, the, sceptre, and, rod, pope, clement, vii, was, furious, at, this, defiance, but, he, could, not, take, decisive, action, as, he, was, pressured, by, other, monarchs, to, avoid, an, irreparable, breach, with, england, on, 9, july, he, provisionally, excommunicated, henry, and, his, advisers, who, included, cranmer, unless, he, repudiated, anne, by, the, end, of, september, henry, kept, anne, as, his, wife, and, on, 7, september, anne, gave, birth, to, elizabeth, cranmer, baptised, her, immediately, afterwards, and, acted, as, one, of, her, godparents, it, is, difficult, to, assess, how, cranmer, s, theological, views, had, evolved, since, his, cambridge, days, there, is, evidence, that, he, continued, to, support, humanism, he, renewed, erasmus, pension, that, had, previously, been, granted, by, archbishop, warham, in, june, 1533, he, was, confronted, with, the, difficult, tasks, not, only, of, disciplining, a, reformer, but, also, of, seeing, him, burned, at, the, stake, john, frith, was, condemned, to, death, for, his, views, on, the, eucharist, he, denied, the, real, presence, cranmer, personally, tried, to, persuade, him, to, change, his, views, without, success, although, he, rejected, frith, s, radicalism, by, 1534, he, clearly, signalled, that, he, had, broken, with, rome, and, that, he, had, set, a, new, theological, course, he, supported, the, cause, of, reform, by, gradually, replacing, the, old, guard, in, his, ecclesiastical, province, with, men, such, as, hugh, latimer, who, followed, the, new, thinking, he, intervened, in, religious, disputes, supporting, reformers, to, the, disappointment, of, religious, conservatives, who, desired, to, maintain, the, link, with, rome, cranmer, was, not, immediately, accepted, by, the, bishops, within, his, province, when, he, attempted, a, canonical, visitation, he, had, to, avoid, locations, where, a, resident, conservative, bishop, might, make, an, embarrassing, personal, challenge, to, his, authority, in, 1535, cranmer, had, difficult, encounters, with, several, bishops, john, stokesley, john, longland, and, stephen, gardiner, among, others, they, objected, to, cranmer, s, power, and, title, and, argued, that, the, act, of, supremacy, did, not, define, his, role, this, prompted, thomas, cromwell, the, king, s, chief, minister, to, activate, and, to, take, the, office, of, the, vicegerent, the, deputy, supreme, head, of, ecclesiastical, affairs, he, created, another, set, of, institutions, that, gave, a, clear, structure, to, the, royal, supremacy, hence, the, archbishop, was, eclipsed, by, vicegerent, cromwell, in, regard, to, the, king, s, spiritual, jurisdiction, there, is, no, evidence, that, cranmer, resented, his, position, as, junior, partner, although, he, was, an, exceptional, scholar, he, lacked, the, political, ability, to, outface, even, clerical, opponents, those, tasks, were, left, to, cromwell, on, 29, january, 1536, when, anne, miscarried, a, son, the, king, began, to, reflect, again, on, the, biblical, prohibitions, that, had, haunted, him, during, his, marriage, with, catherine, of, aragon, shortly, after, the, miscarriage, the, king, started, to, take, an, interest, in, jane, seymour, by, 24, april, he, had, commissioned, cromwell, to, prepare, the, case, for, a, divorce, unaware, of, these, plans, cranmer, had, continued, to, write, letters, to, cromwell, on, minor, matters, up, to, 22, april, anne, was, sent, to, the, tower, of, london, on, 2, may, and, cranmer, was, urgently, summoned, by, cromwell, on, the, very, next, day, cranmer, wrote, a, letter, to, the, king, expressing, his, doubts, about, the, queen, s, guilt, highlighting, his, own, esteem, for, anne, after, it, was, delivered, cranmer, was, resigned, to, the, fact, that, the, end, of, anne, s, marriage, was, inevitable, on, 16, may, he, saw, anne, in, the, tower, and, heard, her, confession, and, the, following, day, he, pronounced, the, marriage, null, and, void, two, days, later, anne, was, executed, cranmer, was, one, of, the, few, who, publicly, mourned, her, death, the, vicegerency, brought, the, pace, of, reforms, under, the, control, of, the, king, a, balance, was, instituted, between, the, conservatives, and, the, reformers, and, this, was, seen, in, the, ten, articles, the, first, attempt, at, defining, the, beliefs, of, the, henrician, church, the, articles, had, a, two, part, structure, the, first, five, articles, showed, the, influence, of, the, reformers, by, recognising, only, three, of, the, former, seven, sacraments, baptism, eucharist, and, penance, the, last, five, articles, concerned, the, roles, of, images, saints, rites, and, ceremonies, and, purgatory, and, they, reflected, the, views, of, the, traditionalists, two, early, drafts, of, the, document, have, been, preserved, and, show, different, teams, of, theologians, at, work, the, competition, between, the, conservatives, and, reformers, is, revealed, in, rival, editorial, corrections, made, by, cranmer, and, cuthbert, tunstall, the, bishop, of, durham, the, end, product, had, something, that, pleased, and, annoyed, both, sides, of, the, debate, by, 11, july, cranmer, cromwell, and, the, convocation, the, general, assembly, of, the, clergy, had, subscribed, to, the, ten, articles, in, late, 1536, the, north, of, england, was, convulsed, in, a, series, of, uprisings, collectively, known, as, the, pilgrimage, of, grace, the, most, serious, opposition, to, henry, s, policies, cromwell, and, cranmer, were, the, primary, targets, of, the, protesters, fury, cromwell, and, the, king, worked, furiously, to, quell, the, rebellion, while, cranmer, kept, a, low, profile, after, it, was, clear, that, henry, s, regime, was, safe, the, government, took, the, initiative, to, remedy, the, evident, inadequacy, of, the, ten, articles, the, outcome, after, months, of, debate, was, the, institution, of, a, christian, man, informally, known, from, the, first, issue, as, the, bishops, book, the, book, was, initially, proposed, in, february, 1537, in, the, first, vicegerential, synod, ordered, by, cromwell, for, the, whole, church, cromwell, opened, the, proceedings, but, as, the, synod, progressed, cranmer, and, foxe, took, on, the, chairmanship, and, the, co, ordination, foxe, did, most, of, the, final, editing, and, the, book, was, published, in, late, september, even, after, publication, the, book, s, status, remained, vague, because, the, king, had, not, given, his, full, support, to, it, in, a, draft, letter, henry, noted, that, he, had, not, read, the, book, but, supported, its, printing, his, attention, was, most, likely, occupied, by, the, pregnancy, of, jane, seymour, and, the, birth, of, the, male, heir, edward, that, henry, had, sought, for, so, long, jane, died, shortly, after, giving, birth, and, her, funeral, was, held, on, 12, november, that, month, henry, started, to, work, on, the, bishops, book, his, amendments, were, sent, to, cranmer, sampson, and, others, for, comment, cranmer, s, responses, to, the, king, were, far, more, confrontational, than, his, colleagues, and, he, wrote, at, much, greater, length, they, reveal, unambiguous, statements, supporting, reformed, theology, such, as, justification, by, faith, or, sola, fide, faith, alone, and, predestination, his, words, did, not, convince, the, king, a, new, statement, of, faith, was, delayed, until, 1543, with, the, publication, of, the, king, s, book, in, 1538, the, king, and, cromwell, arranged, with, lutheran, princes, to, have, detailed, discussions, on, forming, a, political, and, religious, alliance, henry, had, been, seeking, a, new, embassy, from, the, schmalkaldic, league, since, mid, 1537, the, lutherans, were, delighted, by, this, and, they, sent, a, joint, delegation, from, various, german, cities, including, a, colleague, of, martin, luther, s, friedrich, myconius, the, delegates, arrived, in, england, on, 27, may, 1538, after, initial, meetings, with, the, king, cromwell, and, cranmer, discussions, on, theological, differences, were, transferred, to, lambeth, palace, under, cranmer, s, chairmanship, progress, on, an, agreement, was, slow, partly, owing, to, cromwell, being, too, busy, to, help, expedite, the, proceedings, and, partly, because, the, negotiating, team, on, the, english, side, was, evenly, balanced, between, conservatives, and, reformers, the, talks, dragged, on, with, the, germans, becoming, weary, despite, the, archbishop, s, strenuous, efforts, the, negotiations, were, fatally, neutralised, by, an, appointee, of, the, king, cranmer, s, colleague, edward, foxe, who, sat, on, henry, s, privy, council, had, died, earlier, in, the, year, the, king, chose, as, his, replacement, cranmer, s, conservative, rival, cuthbert, tunstall, who, was, told, to, stay, near, henry, to, give, advice, on, 5, august, when, the, german, delegates, sent, a, letter, to, the, king, regarding, three, items, that, particularly, worried, them, compulsory, clerical, celibacy, the, withholding, of, the, chalice, from, the, laity, and, the, maintenance, of, private, masses, for, the, dead, tunstall, was, able, to, intervene, for, the, king, and, to, influence, the, decision, the, result, was, a, thorough, dismissal, by, the, king, of, many, of, the, germans, chief, concerns, although, cranmer, begged, the, germans, to, continue, with, the, negotiations, using, the, argument, to, consider, the, many, thousands, of, souls, in, england, at, stake, they, left, on, 1, october, without, any, substantial, achievements, continental, reformer, philipp, melanchthon, was, aware, that, he, was, very, much, admired, by, henry, in, early, 1539, melanchthon, wrote, several, letters, to, henry, criticising, his, views, on, religion, in, particular, his, support, of, clerical, celibacy, by, late, april, another, delegation, from, the, lutheran, princes, arrived, to, build, on, melanchthon, s, exhortations, cromwell, wrote, a, letter, to, the, king, in, support, of, the, new, lutheran, mission, the, king, had, begun, to, change, his, stance, and, concentrated, on, wooing, conservative, opinion, in, england, rather, than, reaching, out, to, the, lutherans, on, 28, april, 1539, parliament, met, for, the, first, time, in, three, years, cranmer, was, present, but, cromwell, was, unable, to, attend, due, to, ill, health, on, 5, may, the, house, of, lords, created, a, committee, with, the, customary, religious, balance, between, conservatives, and, reformers, to, examine, and, determine, doctrine, the, committee, was, given, little, time, to, do, the, detailed, work, needed, for, a, thorough, revision, on, 16, may, the, duke, of, norfolk, noted, that, the, committee, had, not, agreed, on, anything, and, proposed, that, the, lords, examine, six, doctrinal, questions, which, eventually, formed, the, basis, of, the, six, articles, they, affirmed, the, conservative, interpretation, of, doctrines, such, as, the, real, presence, clerical, celibacy, and, the, necessity, of, auricular, confession, the, private, confession, of, sins, to, a, priest, as, the, act, of, the, six, articles, neared, passage, in, parliament, cranmer, moved, his, wife, and, children, out, of, england, to, safety, up, until, this, time, the, family, was, kept, quietly, hidden, most, likely, in, ford, palace, in, kent, the, act, passed, parliament, at, the, end, of, june, and, it, forced, latimer, and, nicholas, shaxton, to, resign, their, dioceses, given, their, outspoken, opposition, to, the, measure, the, setback, for, the, reformers, was, short, lived, by, september, henry, was, displeased, with, the, results, of, the, act, and, its, promulgators, the, ever, loyal, cranmer, and, cromwell, were, back, in, favour, the, king, asked, his, archbishop, to, write, a, new, preface, for, the, great, bible, an, english, translation, of, the, bible, that, was, first, published, in, april, 1539, under, the, direction, of, cromwell, the, preface, was, in, the, form, of, a, sermon, addressed, to, readers, as, for, cromwell, he, was, delighted, that, his, plan, of, a, royal, marriage, between, henry, and, anne, of, cleves, the, sister, of, a, german, prince, was, accepted, by, the, king, in, cromwell, s, view, the, marriage, could, potentially, bring, back, contacts, with, the, schmalkaldic, league, henry, was, dismayed, with, anne, when, they, first, met, on, 1, january, 1540, but, married, her, reluctantly, on, 6, january, in, a, ceremony, officiated, by, cranmer, the, marriage, ended, in, disaster, as, henry, decided, that, he, would, request, a, royal, divorce, this, resulted, in, henry, being, placed, in, an, embarrassing, position, and, cromwell, suffered, the, consequences, his, old, enemies, including, the, duke, of, norfolk, took, advantage, of, the, weakened, cromwell, and, he, was, arrested, on, 10, june, he, immediately, lost, the, support, of, all, his, friends, including, cranmer, as, cranmer, had, done, for, anne, boleyn, he, wrote, a, letter, to, the, king, defending, the, past, work, of, cromwell, henry, s, marriage, to, anne, of, cleves, was, quickly, annulled, on, 9, july, by, the, vice, gerential, synod, now, led, by, cranmer, and, gardiner, following, the, annulment, cromwell, was, executed, on, 28, july, cranmer, now, found, himself, in, a, politically, prominent, position, with, no, one, else, to, shoulder, the, burden, throughout, the, rest, of, henry, s, reign, he, clung, to, henry, s, authority, the, king, had, total, trust, in, him, and, in, return, cranmer, could, not, conceal, anything, from, the, king, at, the, end, of, june, 1541, henry, with, his, new, wife, catherine, howard, left, for, his, first, visit, to, the, north, of, england, cranmer, was, left, in, london, as, a, member, of, a, council, taking, care, of, matters, for, the, king, in, his, absence, his, colleagues, were, lord, chancellor, thomas, audley, and, edward, seymour, earl, of, hertford, this, was, cranmer, s, first, major, piece, of, responsibility, outside, the, church, in, october, while, the, king, and, queen, were, away, a, reformer, named, john, lascelles, revealed, to, cranmer, that, catherine, engaged, in, extramarital, affairs, cranmer, gave, the, information, to, audley, and, seymour, and, they, decided, to, wait, until, henry, s, return, afraid, of, angering, the, king, audley, and, seymour, suggested, that, cranmer, inform, henry, cranmer, slipped, a, message, to, henry, during, mass, on, all, saints, day, an, investigation, revealed, the, truth, of, the, marital, indiscretions, and, catherine, was, executed, in, february, 1542, in, 1543, several, conservative, clergymen, in, kent, banded, together, to, attack, and, denounce, two, reformers, richard, turner, and, john, bland, before, the, privy, council, they, prepared, articles, to, present, to, the, council, but, at, the, last, moment, additional, denunciations, were, added, by, stephen, gardiner, s, nephew, germain, gardiner, these, new, articles, attacked, cranmer, and, listed, his, misdeeds, back, to, 1541, this, document, and, the, following, actions, were, the, basis, of, the, so, called, prebendaries, plot, the, articles, were, delivered, to, the, council, in, london, and, were, probably, read, on, 22, april, 1543, the, king, most, likely, saw, the, articles, against, cranmer, that, night, the, archbishop, appeared, unaware, that, an, attack, on, his, person, was, made, his, commissioners, in, lambeth, dealt, specifically, with, turner, s, case, where, he, was, acquitted, much, to, the, fury, of, the, conservatives, while, the, plot, against, cranmer, proceeded, the, reformers, were, attacked, on, other, fronts, on, 20, april, the, convocation, reconvened, to, consider, revising, the, bishops, book, cranmer, presided, over, the, sub, committees, but, the, conservatives, were, able, to, overturn, many, reforming, ideas, including, justification, by, faith, alone, on, 5, may, the, new, revision, called, a, necessary, doctrine, and, erudition, for, any, christian, man, or, the, king, s, book, was, released, doctrinally, it, was, far, more, conservative, than, the, bishops, book, on, 10, may, the, reformers, received, another, blow, parliament, passed, the, act, for, the, advancement, of, true, religion, which, abolished, erroneous, books, and, restricted, the, reading, of, the, bible, in, english, to, those, of, noble, status, reformers, were, examined, forced, to, recant, or, imprisoned, from, may, to, august, for, five, months, henry, took, no, action, on, the, accusations, against, his, archbishop, the, conspiracy, was, finally, revealed, to, cranmer, by, the, king, himself, according, to, cranmer, s, secretary, ralph, morice, sometime, in, september, 1543, the, king, showed, cranmer, a, paper, summarising, the, accusations, against, him, an, investigation, was, to, be, mounted, and, cranmer, was, appointed, chief, investigator, surprise, raids, were, carried, out, evidence, gathered, and, ringleaders, identified, typically, cranmer, put, the, clergymen, involved, in, the, conspiracy, through, immediate, humiliation, but, he, eventually, forgave, them, and, continued, to, use, their, services, to, show, his, trust, in, cranmer, henry, gave, cranmer, his, ring, when, the, privy, council, arrested, cranmer, at, the, end, of, november, the, nobles, were, hampered, by, the, symbol, of, the, king, s, trust, in, him, cranmer, s, victory, ended, with, two, second, rank, leaders, imprisoned, and, germain, gardiner, executed, with, the, atmosphere, in, cranmer, s, favour, he, pursued, quiet, efforts, to, reform, the, church, particularly, the, liturgy, on, 27, may, 1544, the, first, officially, authorised, vernacular, service, was, published, the, processional, service, of, intercession, known, as, the, exhortation, and, litany, it, survives, today, with, minor, modifications, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, the, traditional, litany, uses, invocations, to, saints, but, cranmer, thoroughly, reformed, this, aspect, by, providing, no, opportunity, in, the, text, for, such, veneration, additional, reformers, were, elected, to, the, house, of, commons, and, new, legislation, was, introduced, to, curb, the, effects, of, the, act, of, the, six, articles, and, the, act, for, the, advancement, of, true, religion, in, 1546, the, conservatives, in, a, coalition, including, gardiner, the, duke, of, norfolk, the, lord, chancellor, wriothesley, and, the, bishop, of, london, edmund, bonner, made, one, last, attempt, to, challenge, the, reformers, several, reformers, with, links, to, cranmer, were, targeted, some, such, as, lascelles, were, burned, at, the, stake, powerful, reform, minded, nobles, edward, seymour, and, john, dudley, returned, to, england, from, overseas, and, turned, the, tide, against, the, conservatives, two, incidents, tipped, the, balance, gardiner, was, disgraced, before, the, king, when, he, refused, to, agree, to, exchange, episcopal, estates, and, the, son, of, the, duke, of, norfolk, was, charged, with, treason, and, executed, there, is, no, evidence, that, cranmer, played, any, part, in, these, political, games, and, there, were, no, further, plots, as, the, king, s, health, ebbed, in, his, final, months, cranmer, performed, his, final, duties, for, the, king, on, 28, january, 1547, when, he, gave, a, reformed, statement, of, faith, while, gripping, henry, s, hand, instead, of, giving, him, his, last, rites, cranmer, mourned, henry, s, death, and, it, was, later, said, that, he, demonstrated, his, grief, by, growing, a, beard, the, beard, was, also, a, sign, of, his, break, with, the, past, continental, reformers, grew, beards, to, mark, their, rejection, of, the, old, church, and, this, significance, of, clerical, beards, was, well, understood, in, england, on, 31, january, he, was, among, the, executors, of, the, king, s, final, will, that, nominated, edward, seymour, as, lord, protector, and, welcomed, the, boy, king, edward, vi, under, the, regency, of, seymour, the, reformers, became, part, of, the, establishment, a, royal, visitation, of, the, provinces, took, place, in, august, 1547, and, each, parish, was, instructed, to, obtain, a, copy, of, the, homilies, this, book, consisted, of, twelve, homilies, four, of, which, were, written, by, cranmer, his, reassertion, of, the, doctrine, of, justification, by, faith, elicited, a, strong, reaction, from, gardiner, in, the, homily, of, good, works, annexed, to, faith, cranmer, attacked, monasticism, and, the, importance, of, various, personal, actions, involved, in, liturgical, recitations, and, ceremonies, hence, he, narrowed, the, range, of, good, works, considered, necessary, and, reinforced, the, importance, of, faith, in, each, parish, visited, injunctions, were, put, in, place, that, resolved, to, eliminate, any, image, which, had, any, suspicion, of, devotion, attached, to, it, cranmer, s, eucharistic, views, which, had, already, moved, away, from, official, catholic, doctrine, received, another, push, from, continental, reformers, cranmer, had, been, in, contact, with, martin, bucer, since, initial, contacts, were, made, with, the, schmalkaldic, league, cranmer, and, bucer, s, relationship, became, ever, closer, owing, to, charles, v, s, victory, over, the, league, at, m, hlberg, which, left, england, as, the, sole, major, nation, that, gave, sanctuary, to, persecuted, reformers, cranmer, wrote, a, letter, to, bucer, now, lost, with, questions, on, eucharistic, theology, in, bucer, s, reply, dated, 28, november, 1547, he, denied, the, human, real, presence, and, condemned, transubstantiation, and, the, adoration, of, the, elements, the, letter, was, delivered, to, cranmer, by, two, italian, reformed, theologians, peter, martyr, and, bernardino, ochino, who, were, invited, to, take, refuge, in, england, martyr, also, brought, with, him, an, epistle, written, allegedly, by, john, chrysostom, ad, caesarium, monachum, which, appeared, to, provide, patristic, support, against, the, corporeal, real, presence, these, documents, influenced, cranmer, s, thoughts, on, the, eucharist, in, march, 1549, strasbourg, forced, martin, bucer, and, paul, fagius, to, leave, cranmer, immediately, invited, the, men, to, england, and, promised, they, would, be, placed, in, english, universities, when, they, arrived, on, 25, april, cranmer, was, delighted, to, meet, bucer, face, to, face, after, eighteen, years, of, correspondence, he, needed, these, scholarly, men, to, train, a, new, generation, of, preachers, as, well, as, to, assist, in, the, reform, of, liturgy, and, doctrine, others, who, accepted, his, invitations, included, the, polish, reformer, jan, aski, but, cranmer, could, not, convince, osiander, and, melanchthon, that, they, should, come, to, england, as, the, use, of, english, in, worship, services, spread, the, need, for, a, complete, uniform, liturgy, for, the, church, became, evident, initial, meetings, to, start, what, would, eventually, become, the, 1549, book, of, common, prayer, were, held, in, the, former, abbey, of, chertsey, and, in, windsor, castle, in, september, 1548, the, list, of, participants, can, be, only, partially, reconstructed, but, it, is, known, that, the, members, were, balanced, between, conservatives, and, reformers, these, meetings, were, followed, by, a, debate, on, the, eucharist, in, the, house, of, lords, which, took, place, between, 14, and, 19, december, cranmer, publicly, revealed, in, this, debate, that, he, had, abandoned, the, doctrine, of, the, corporeal, real, presence, and, believed, that, the, eucharistic, presence, was, only, spiritual, parliament, backed, the, publication, of, the, prayer, book, after, christmas, by, passing, the, act, of, uniformity, 1549, it, then, legalised, clerical, marriage, it, is, difficult, to, ascertain, how, much, of, the, prayer, book, is, cranmer, s, personal, composition, generations, of, liturgical, scholars, have, been, able, to, track, down, the, sources, that, he, used, including, the, sarum, rite, writings, from, hermann, von, wied, and, several, lutheran, sources, including, osiander, and, justus, jonas, it, is, more, problematic, to, determine, how, cranmer, worked, on, the, book, and, with, whom, he, worked, where, information, about, his, possible, helpers, is, lacking, he, is, given, the, credit, for, the, editorship, and, the, overall, structure, of, the, book, the, use, of, the, new, prayer, book, was, made, compulsory, on, 9, june, 1549, this, triggered, a, series, of, protests, in, devon, and, cornwall, where, the, english, language, was, not, yet, in, common, usage, now, known, as, the, prayer, book, rebellion, by, early, july, the, uprising, had, spread, to, other, parts, in, the, east, of, england, the, rebels, made, a, number, of, demands, including, the, restoration, of, the, six, articles, the, use, of, latin, for, the, mass, with, only, the, consecrated, bread, given, to, the, laity, the, restoration, of, prayers, for, souls, in, purgatory, and, the, rebuilding, of, abbeys, cranmer, wrote, a, strong, response, to, these, demands, to, the, king, in, which, he, denounced, the, wickedness, of, the, rebellion, on, 21, july, cranmer, commandeered, st, paul, s, cathedral, where, he, vigorously, defended, the, official, church, line, a, draft, of, his, sermon, the, only, extant, written, sample, of, his, preaching, from, his, entire, career, shows, that, he, collaborated, with, peter, martyr, on, dealing, with, the, rebellion, the, prayer, book, rebellion, and, other, events, harmed, the, seymour, regency, the, privy, council, became, divided, when, several, dissident, councillors, joined, behind, john, dudley, to, oust, seymour, cranmer, and, two, other, councillors, william, paget, and, thomas, smith, initially, rallied, behind, seymour, after, a, flurry, of, letters, passed, between, the, two, sides, a, bloodless, coup, d, tat, ended, seymour, s, protectorship, on, 13, october, 1549, despite, the, support, of, religiously, conservative, politicians, behind, dudley, s, coup, the, reformers, managed, to, maintain, control, of, the, new, government, and, the, english, reformation, continued, to, consolidate, gains, seymour, was, initially, imprisoned, in, the, tower, but, was, shortly, released, on, 6, february, 1550, and, returned, to, the, council, the, archbishop, was, able, to, transfer, his, former, chaplain, nicholas, ridley, from, the, minor, see, of, rochester, to, the, diocese, of, london, at, the, same, time, john, ponet, took, ridley, s, former, position, incumbent, conservatives, were, uprooted, and, replaced, with, reformers, the, first, result, of, cooperation, and, consultation, between, cranmer, and, bucer, was, the, first, edwardine, ordinal, the, liturgy, for, the, ordination, of, priests, this, was, missing, in, the, first, prayer, book, and, was, not, published, until, 1550, cranmer, adopted, bucer, s, draft, and, created, three, services, for, commissioning, a, deacon, a, priest, and, a, bishop, in, the, same, year, cranmer, produced, the, defence, of, the, true, and, catholic, doctrine, of, the, sacrament, of, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, a, semi, official, explanation, of, the, eucharistic, theology, within, the, prayer, book, it, was, the, first, full, length, book, with, cranmer, s, name, on, the, title, page, the, preface, summarises, his, quarrel, with, rome, in, a, well, known, passage, where, he, compared, beads, pardons, pilgrimages, and, such, other, like, popery, with, weeds, still, the, roots, of, the, weeds, were, transubstantiation, the, corporeal, real, presence, and, the, sacrificial, nature, of, the, mass, although, bucer, assisted, in, the, development, of, the, english, reformation, he, was, still, quite, concerned, about, the, speed, of, its, progress, both, bucer, and, fagius, had, noticed, that, the, 1549, prayer, book, was, not, a, remarkable, step, forward, however, cranmer, assured, bucer, that, it, was, only, a, first, step, and, that, its, initial, form, was, temporary, by, late, 1550, bucer, was, becoming, disillusioned, cranmer, ensured, he, did, not, feel, alienated, and, kept, in, close, touch, with, him, this, attention, paid, off, during, the, vestments, controversy, this, incident, was, initiated, by, john, hooper, a, follower, of, heinrich, bullinger, who, had, recently, returned, from, z, rich, hooper, was, unhappy, with, cranmer, s, prayer, book, and, ordinal, and, particularly, objected, to, using, ceremonies, and, vestments, when, the, privy, council, selected, him, to, be, the, bishop, of, gloucester, on, 15, may, 1550, he, laid, down, conditions, for, not, wearing, the, required, vestments, he, found, an, ally, among, the, continental, reformers, in, jan, aski, who, had, become, a, leader, of, the, stranger, church, in, london, a, designated, place, of, worship, for, continental, protestant, refugees, his, church, s, forms, and, practices, had, taken, reforms, much, further, than, cranmer, would, have, liked, bucer, and, peter, martyr, while, they, sympathised, with, hooper, s, position, supported, cranmer, s, arguments, of, timing, and, authority, cranmer, and, ridley, stood, their, ground, this, led, to, hooper, s, imprisonment, and, he, eventually, gave, in, he, was, consecrated, on, 8, march, 1551, according, to, the, ordinal, and, preached, before, the, king, in, his, episcopal, garments, cranmer, s, vision, of, reform, was, maintained, through, careful, steps, under, the, government, s, authority, cranmer, s, role, in, politics, was, diminishing, when, on, 16, october, 1551, seymour, was, arrested, on, charges, of, treason, in, december, seymour, was, put, on, trial, and, although, acquitted, of, treason, he, was, judged, guilty, of, felony, and, was, put, to, death, on, 22, january, 1552, this, began, the, breach, between, cranmer, and, dudley, it, was, aggravated, during, the, year, by, the, regency, s, gradual, appropriation, of, ecclesiastical, property, throughout, this, political, turmoil, cranmer, worked, simultaneously, on, three, major, projects, in, his, reform, programme, the, revision, of, canon, law, the, revision, of, the, prayer, book, and, the, formation, of, a, statement, of, doctrine, the, original, catholic, canon, law, that, defined, governance, within, the, church, needed, revision, following, henry, s, break, with, rome, several, revision, attempts, were, made, throughout, henry, s, reign, but, these, initial, projects, were, shelved, as, the, speed, of, reform, outpaced, the, time, required, to, revise, as, the, reformation, stabilised, cranmer, formed, a, committee, in, december, 1551, to, restart, the, work, he, recruited, peter, martyr, to, the, committee, and, he, also, asked, aski, and, hooper, to, participate, showing, his, habitual, ability, to, forgive, past, actions, cranmer, and, martyr, realised, that, a, successful, enactment, of, a, reformed, ecclesiastical, law, code, in, england, would, have, international, significance, cranmer, planned, to, draw, together, all, the, reformed, churches, of, europe, under, england, s, leadership, to, counter, the, council, of, trent, the, catholic, church, s, response, to, the, protestant, reformation, in, march, 1552, cranmer, invited, the, foremost, continental, reformers, bullinger, john, calvin, and, melanchthon, to, come, to, england, and, to, participate, in, an, ecumenical, council, the, response, was, disappointing, melanchthon, did, not, respond, bullinger, stated, that, neither, of, them, could, leave, germany, as, it, was, riven, by, war, between, the, emperor, and, the, lutheran, princes, and, while, calvin, showed, some, enthusiasm, he, said, he, was, unable, to, come, cranmer, acknowledged, calvin, and, replied, meanwhile, we, will, reform, the, english, church, to, the, utmost, of, our, ability, and, give, our, labour, that, both, its, doctrines, and, laws, will, be, improved, after, the, model, of, holy, scripture, one, partial, manuscript, of, the, project, survived, that, was, annotated, with, corrections, and, comments, by, cranmer, and, martyr, when, the, final, version, was, presented, to, parliament, the, breach, between, cranmer, and, dudley, was, complete, and, the, regent, effectively, killed, the, canon, law, bill, in, the, house, of, lords, as, with, the, first, prayer, book, the, origins, and, participants, in, its, revision, are, obscure, but, it, was, clear, that, cranmer, led, the, project, and, steered, its, development, it, had, begun, as, early, as, the, end, of, 1549, when, the, convocation, of, canterbury, met, to, discuss, the, matter, late, in, 1550, the, opinions, of, martyr, and, bucer, were, sought, on, how, the, liturgy, might, be, improved, and, they, influenced, the, revision, significantly, the, view, of, the, spiritual, presence, was, clarified, by, the, use, of, entirely, different, words, at, the, offering, of, the, bread, and, the, wine, to, the, communicants, new, rubrics, noted, that, any, bread, could, be, used, and, any, bread, or, wine, that, remained, could, be, used, by, the, curate, thus, dissociating, the, elements, from, any, physical, presence, the, new, book, removed, any, possibility, of, prayers, for, the, dead, because, such, prayers, implied, support, for, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, the, act, of, uniformity, 1552, which, authorised, the, book, s, use, specified, that, it, be, exclusively, used, from, 1, november, the, final, version, was, officially, published, at, almost, the, last, minute, owing, to, dudley, s, intervention, while, travelling, in, the, north, of, the, country, he, met, the, scots, reformer, john, knox, who, was, based, in, newcastle, impressed, by, his, preaching, dudley, selected, him, as, a, royal, chaplain, and, brought, him, south, to, participate, in, the, reform, projects, in, a, sermon, before, the, king, knox, attacked, the, practice, of, kneeling, during, communion, on, 27, september, 1552, the, privy, council, stopped, the, printing, of, the, new, prayer, book, and, told, cranmer, to, revise, it, he, responded, with, a, long, letter, arguing, that, it, was, for, parliament, with, the, royal, assent, to, decide, any, changes, in, the, liturgy, on, 22, october, the, council, decided, to, keep, the, liturgy, as, it, was, and, to, add, the, so, called, black, rubric, which, explained, that, no, adoration, was, intended, when, kneeling, at, communion, the, origins, of, the, statement, which, eventually, became, the, forty, two, articles, are, equally, obscure, as, early, as, december, 1549, the, archbishop, demanded, that, his, bishops, subscribe, to, certain, doctrinal, articles, in, 1551, cranmer, presented, a, version, of, a, statement, to, the, bishops, but, its, status, remained, ambiguous, cranmer, did, not, devote, much, effort, to, developing, the, articles, most, likely, owing, to, work, on, the, canon, law, revision, he, became, more, interested, once, the, hope, for, an, ecumenical, council, faded, by, september, 1552, draft, versions, of, the, articles, were, being, worked, on, by, cranmer, and, john, cheke, his, scholarly, friend, commissioned, to, translate, them, into, latin, when, the, forty, two, articles, were, finally, published, in, may, 1553, the, title, page, declared, that, the, convocation, agreed, upon, the, articles, which, were, published, by, the, king, s, authority, this, was, not, the, case, and, the, mistake, was, likely, caused, by, miscommunications, between, the, archbishop, and, the, privy, council, cranmer, complained, about, this, to, the, council, but, the, authorities, noted, that, the, articles, were, developed, during, the, convocation, hence, evading, giving, a, direct, answer, the, council, gave, cranmer, the, unhappy, task, of, requiring, the, bishops, to, subscribe, to, the, articles, many, of, whom, opposed, them, and, pointed, out, the, anomaly, of, the, title, page, while, cranmer, was, carrying, out, this, duty, events, unfolded, that, rendered, the, subscriptions, futile, edward, vi, became, seriously, ill, and, the, councillors, were, told, that, he, did, not, have, long, to, live, in, may, 1553, the, council, sent, several, letters, to, continental, reformers, assuring, them, that, edward, s, health, was, improving, among, the, letters, was, one, addressed, to, melanchthon, inviting, him, to, come, to, england, to, take, up, the, regius, chair, in, cambridge, which, had, been, vacant, since, the, death, of, martin, bucer, in, february, 1551, both, henry, viii, and, cranmer, had, previously, failed, to, convince, melanchthon, to, come, this, time, the, council, made, a, serious, effort, by, sending, him, an, advance, to, cover, his, travel, expenses, cranmer, sent, a, personal, letter, urging, him, to, take, the, offer, despite, his, plea, melanchthon, never, made, the, voyage, to, england, while, this, effort, to, shore, up, the, reformation, was, taking, place, the, council, was, working, to, persuade, several, judges, to, put, on, the, throne, lady, jane, grey, edward, s, cousin, and, a, protestant, instead, of, mary, henry, and, catherine, of, aragon, s, daughter, and, a, catholic, on, 17, june, 1553, the, king, made, his, will, noting, jane, would, succeed, him, contravening, the, third, succession, act, cranmer, tried, to, speak, to, edward, alone, but, he, was, refused, and, his, audience, with, edward, occurred, in, the, presence, of, the, councillors, edward, told, him, that, he, supported, what, he, had, written, in, his, will, cranmer, s, decision, to, support, jane, must, have, occurred, before, 19, june, when, royal, orders, were, sent, to, convene, the, convocation, for, the, recognition, of, the, new, succession, by, mid, july, there, were, serious, provincial, revolts, in, mary,

taken, against, the, archbishop, on, 8, august, he, led, edward, s, funeral, according, to, the, rites, of, the, prayer, book, during, these, months, he, advised, others, including, peter, martyr, to, flee, england, but, he, himself, chose, to, stay, reformed, bishops, were, removed, from, office, and, conservative, clergy, such, as, edmund, bonner, had, their, old, positions, restored, cranmer, did, not, go, down, without, a, fight, when, rumours, spread, that, he, authorised, the, use, of, the, mass, in, canterbury, cathedral, he, declared, them, to, be, false, and, said, all, the, doctrine, and, religion, by, our, said, sovereign, lord, king, edward, vi, is, more, pure, and, according, to, god, s, word, than, any, that, hath, been, used, in, england, these, thousand, years, not, surprisingly, the, government, regarded, cranmer, s, declaration, as, tantamount, to, sedition, he, was, ordered, to, stand, before, the, council, in, the, star, chamber, on, 14, september, and, on, that, day, he, said, his, final, goodbye, to, martyr, cranmer, was, sent, straight, to, the, tower, to, join, hugh, latimer, and, nicholas, ridley, on, 13, november, 1553, cranmer, and, four, others, were, brought, to, trial, for, treason, found, guilty, and, condemned, to, death, numerous, witnesses, testified, that, cranmer, had, encouraged, heresy, and, had, written, heretical, works, through, february, 1554, jane, grey, and, other, rebels, were, executed, and, attention, then, turned, to, the, religious, leaders, of, the, reformation, on, 8, march, 1554, the, privy, council, ordered, cranmer, ridley, and, latimer, to, be, transferred, to, bocardo, prison, in, oxford, to, await, a, second, trial, for, heresy, during, this, time, cranmer, was, able, to, smuggle, out, a, letter, to, martyr, who, had, fled, to, strasbourg, the, last, surviving, document, written, in, his, own, hand, he, stated, that, the, desperate, situation, of, the, church, was, proof, that, it, would, eventually, be, delivered, and, wrote, i, pray, that, god, may, grant, that, we, may, endure, to, the, end, cranmer, remained, isolated, in, bocardo, prison, for, seventeen, months, before, the, trial, started, on, 12, september, 1555, although, it, took, place, in, england, the, trial, was, under, papal, jurisdiction, and, the, final, verdict, would, come, from, rome, under, interrogation, cranmer, admitted, to, every, fact, that, was, placed, before, him, but, he, denied, any, treachery, disobedience, or, heresy, the, trial, of, latimer, and, ridley, started, shortly, after, cranmer, s, but, their, verdicts, came, almost, immediately, and, they, were, burned, at, the, stake, on, 16, october, cranmer, was, taken, to, a, tower, to, watch, the, proceedings, on, 4, december, rome, decided, cranmer, s, fate, by, depriving, him, of, the, archbishopric, and, giving, permission, to, the, secular, authorities, to, carry, out, their, sentence, in, his, final, days, cranmer, s, circumstances, changed, which, led, to, several, recantations, on, 11, december, he, was, taken, out, of, bocardo, and, placed, in, the, house, of, the, dean, of, christ, church, this, new, environment, was, very, different, from, that, of, his, two, years, in, prison, he, was, in, an, academic, community, and, treated, as, a, guest, approached, by, a, dominican, friar, juan, de, villagarc, a, he, debated, the, issues, of, papal, supremacy, and, purgatory, in, his, first, four, recantations, produced, between, the, end, of, january, and, mid, february, cranmer, submitted, himself, to, the, authority, of, the, king, and, queen, and, recognised, the, pope, as, head, of, the, church, on, 14, february, 1556, he, was, degraded, from, holy, orders, and, returned, to, bocardo, he, had, conceded, very, little, and, edmund, bonner, was, not, satisfied, with, these, admissions, on, 24, february, a, writ, was, issued, to, the, mayor, of, oxford, and, the, date, of, cranmer, s, execution, was, set, for, 7, march, two, days, after, the, writ, was, issued, a, fifth, statement, the, first, which, could, be, called, a, true, recantation, was, issued, cranmer, repudiated, all, lutheran, and, zwinglian, theology, fully, accepted, catholic, theology, including, papal, supremacy, and, transubstantiation, and, stated, that, there, was, no, salvation, outside, the, catholic, church, he, announced, his, joy, at, returning, to, the, catholic, faith, asked, for, and, received, sacramental, absolution, and, participated, in, the, mass, cranmer, s, burning, was, postponed, and, under, the, normal, practice, of, canon, law, he, should, have, been, absolved, mary, however, decided, that, no, further, postponement, was, possible, his, last, recantation, was, issued, on, 18, march, it, was, a, sign, of, a, broken, man, a, sweeping, confession, of, sin, despite, the, stipulation, in, canon, law, that, recanting, heretics, be, reprieved, mary, was, determined, to, make, an, example, of, cranmer, arguing, that, his, iniquity, and, obstinacy, was, so, great, against, god, and, your, grace, that, your, clemency, and, mercy, could, have, no, place, with, him, and, pressed, ahead, with, his, execution, cranmer, was, told, that, he, would, be, able, to, make, a, final, recantation, but, that, this, time, it, was, to, be, in, public, during, a, service, at, the, university, church, in, oxford, he, wrote, and, submitted, the, speech, in, advance, and, it, was, published, after, his, death, at, the, pulpit, on, the, day, of, his, execution, 21, march, 1556, he, opened, with, a, prayer, and, an, exhortation, to, obey, the, king, and, queen, but, he, ended, his, sermon, totally, unexpectedly, deviating, from, the, prepared, script, he, renounced, the, recantations, that, he, had, written, or, signed, with, his, own, hand, since, his, degradation, and, he, stated, that, in, consequence, his, hand, would, be, punished, by, being, burnt, first, he, then, said, and, as, for, the, pope, i, refuse, him, as, christ, s, enemy, and, antichrist, with, all, his, false, doctrine, he, was, pulled, from, the, pulpit, and, taken, to, where, latimer, and, ridley, had, been, burnt, six, months, previously, as, the, flames, drew, around, him, he, fulfilled, his, promise, by, placing, his, right, hand, into, the, heart, of, the, fire, calling, it, that, unworthy, hand, his, dying, words, were, lord, jesus, receive, my, spirit, i, see, the, heavens, open, and, jesus, standing, at, the, right, hand, of, god, the, marian, government, produced, a, pamphlet, with, all, six, recantations, plus, the, text, of, the, speech, cranmer, was, to, have, made, in, the, university, church, his, subsequent, withdrawal, of, his, recantations, was, not, mentioned, though, what, actually, happened, soon, became, common, knowledge, undermining, the, effectiveness, of, marian, propaganda, similarly, the, protestant, party, had, difficulty, in, making, use, of, the, event, given, cranmer, s, recantations, the, exiles, propaganda, concentrated, on, publishing, various, specimens, of, his, writings, eventually, john, foxe, put, cranmer, s, story, to, effective, use, in, 1559, and, it, featured, prominently, in, his, acts, and, monuments, when, it, was, first, printed, in, 1563, cranmer, s, family, had, been, exiled, to, the, continent, in, 1539, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, they, returned, to, england, but, it, was, soon, after, the, accession, of, edward, vi, in, 1547, that, cranmer, publicly, acknowledged, their, existence, not, much, is, known, about, the, early, years, of, the, children, his, daughter, margaret, was, likely, born, in, the, 1530s, and, his, son, thomas, came, later, probably, during, the, reign, of, edward, around, the, time, of, mary, s, accession, cranmer, s, wife, margarete, escaped, to, germany, while, his, son, was, entrusted, to, his, brother, edmund, cranmer, who, took, him, to, the, continent, margarete, cranmer, eventually, married, cranmer, s, favourite, publisher, edward, whitchurch, the, couple, returned, to, england, after, mary, s, reign, and, settled, in, surrey, whitchurch, also, negotiated, for, the, marriage, of, margaret, to, thomas, norton, whitchurch, died, in, 1562, and, margarete, married, for, the, third, time, to, bartholomew, scott, she, died, in, the, 1570s, both, of, cranmer, s, children, died, without, issue, and, his, line, became, extinct, when, elizabeth, i, came, to, power, in, 1558, she, restored, the, church, of, england, s, independence, from, rome, under, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, the, church, that, she, re, established, represented, in, effect, a, snapshot, of, the, edwardine, church, from, september, 1552, thus, the, elizabethan, prayer, book, was, basically, cranmer, s, 1552, edition, but, without, the, black, rubric, in, the, convocation, of, 1563, the, forty, two, articles, which, were, never, adopted, by, the, church, were, altered, in, the, area, of, eucharistic, doctrine, to, form, the, thirty, nine, articles, most, of, the, exiles, returned, to, england, and, resumed, their, careers, in, the, church, to, some, like, edmund, grindal, an, archbishop, of, canterbury, during, elizabeth, s, reign, cranmer, provided, a, shining, example, whose, work, should, be, upheld, and, extended, cranmer, s, greatest, concerns, were, the, maintenance, of, the, royal, supremacy, and, the, diffusion, of, reformed, theology, and, practice, scholars, note, that, he, is, best, remembered, for, his, contribution, to, the, realms, of, language, and, of, cultural, identity, his, prose, helped, to, guide, the, development, of, the, english, language, and, the, book, of, common, prayer, is, a, major, contribution, to, english, literature, that, influenced, many, lives, in, the, anglophone, world, it, has, guided, anglican, worship, for, four, hundred, years, catholic, biographers, sometimes, depict, cranmer, as, an, unprincipled, opportunist, a, nicodemite, and, a, tool, of, royal, tyranny, for, their, part, some, protestant, biographers, appear, to, overlook, the, ways, or, occasions, in, which, cranmer, betrayed, his, own, principles, both, sides, can, agree, in, seeing, cranmer, as, a, committed, scholar, whose, life, showed, the, strengths, and, weaknesses, of, a, very, human, and, often, under, appreciated, reformer, the, church, of, england, commemorates, thomas, cranmer, as, a, reformation, martyr, on, 21, march, the, anniversary, of, his, death, and, he, is, remembered, in, the, calendar, of, saints, of, the, church, of, england, with, a, lesser, festival, the, supposed, site, of, the, burnings, is, marked, by, a, paving, cross, in, broad, street, oxford, where, an, annual, remembrance, is, held, by, the, prayer, book, society, the, u, s, episcopal, church, liturgical, calendar, honours, him, together, with, hugh, latimer, and, nicholas, ridley, with, a, day, of, optional, observance, on, 16, october
