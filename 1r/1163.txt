richard, i, 8, september, 1157, 6, april, 1199, known, as, richard, c, ur, de, lion, norman, french, quor, de, lion, or, richard, the, lionheart, because, of, his, reputation, as, a, great, military, leader, and, warrior, was, king, of, england, from, 1189, until, his, death, in, 1199, he, also, ruled, as, duke, of, normandy, aquitaine, and, gascony, lord, of, cyprus, count, of, poitiers, anjou, maine, and, nantes, and, was, overlord, of, brittany, at, various, times, during, the, same, period, he, was, the, third, of, five, sons, of, henry, ii, of, england, and, eleanor, of, aquitaine, and, was, therefore, not, expected, to, become, king, but, his, two, elder, brothers, predeceased, their, father, by, the, age, of, 16, richard, had, taken, command, of, his, own, army, putting, down, rebellions, in, poitou, against, his, father, richard, was, an, important, christian, commander, during, the, third, crusade, leading, the, campaign, after, the, departure, of, philip, ii, of, france, and, achieving, several, victories, against, his, muslim, counterpart, saladin, although, he, finalised, a, peace, treaty, and, ended, the, campaign, without, retaking, jerusalem, richard, probably, spoke, both, french, and, occitan, he, was, born, in, england, where, he, spent, his, childhood, before, becoming, king, however, he, lived, most, of, his, adult, life, in, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, in, the, southwest, of, france, following, his, accession, he, spent, very, little, time, perhaps, as, little, as, six, months, in, england, most, of, his, reign, was, spent, on, crusade, in, captivity, or, actively, defending, the, french, portions, of, the, angevin, empire, though, regarded, as, a, model, king, during, the, four, centuries, after, his, death, and, seen, as, a, pious, hero, by, his, subjects, from, the, 17th, century, onward, he, was, gradually, perceived, by, historians, as, a, ruler, who, preferred, to, use, his, kingdom, merely, as, a, source, of, revenue, to, support, his, armies, rather, than, regarding, england, as, a, responsibility, requiring, his, presence, as, ruler, this, little, england, view, of, richard, has, come, under, increasing, scrutiny, by, modern, historians, who, view, it, as, anachronistic, richard, i, remains, one, of, the, few, kings, of, england, remembered, more, commonly, by, his, epithet, than, his, regnal, number, and, is, an, enduring, iconic, figure, both, in, england, and, in, france, richard, was, born, on, 8, september, 1157, probably, at, beaumont, palace, in, oxford, england, son, of, king, henry, ii, of, england, and, eleanor, of, aquitaine, he, was, the, younger, brother, of, william, henry, the, young, king, and, matilda, william, died, before, richard, s, birth, as, a, younger, son, of, king,

half, sisters, from, his, mother, s, first, marriage, to, louis, vii, of, france, marie, and, alix, richard, is, often, depicted, as, having, been, the, favourite, son, of, his, mother, his, father, was, angevin, norman, and, great, grandson, of, william, the, conqueror, contemporary, historian, ralph, de, diceto, traced, his, family, s, lineage, through, matilda, of, scotland, to, the, anglo, saxon, kings, of, england, and, alfred, the, great, and, from, there, legend, linked, them, to, noah, and, woden, according, to, angevin, family, tradition, there, was, even, infernal, blood, in, their, ancestry, with, a, claimed, descent, from, the, fairy, or, female, demon, melusine, while, his, father, visited, his, lands, from, scotland, to, france, richard, probably, spent, his, childhood, in, england, his, first, recorded, visit, to, the, european, continent, was, in, may, 1165, when, his, mother, took, him, to, normandy, his, wet, nurse, was, hodierna, of, st, albans, whom,

it, is, not, known, to, what, extent, he, used, or, understood, english, he, was, an, educated, man, who, composed, poetry, and, wrote, in, limousin, lenga, d, c, and, also, in, french, during, his, captivity, english, prejudice, against, foreigners, was, used, in, a, calculated, way, by, his, brother, john, to, help, destroy, the, authority, of, richard, s, chancellor, william, longchamp, who, was, a, norman, one, of, the, specific, charges, laid, against, longchamp, by, john, s, supporter, hugh, nonant, was, that, he, could, not, speak, english, this, indicates, that, by, the, late, 12th, century, a, knowledge, of, english, was, expected, of, those, in, positions, of, authority, in, england, richard, was, said, to, be, very, attractive, his, hair, was, between, red, and, blond, and, he, was, light, eyed, with, a, pale, complexion, according, to, clifford, brewer, he, was, 6, feet, 5, inches, 1, 96, m, although, that, is, unverifiable, since, his, remains, have, been, lost, since,

berenguer, iv, count, of, barcelona, however, these, arrangements, failed, and, the, marriage, never, took, place, henry, the, young, king, was, married, to, margaret, daughter, of, louis, vii, of,

1168, the, intercession, of, pope, alexander, iii, was, necessary, to, secure, a, truce, between, them, henry, ii, had, conquered, brittany, and, taken, control, of, gisors, and, the, vexin, which, had, been, part, of, margaret, s, dowry, early, in, the, 1160s, there, had, been, suggestions, richard, should, marry, alys, countess, of, the, vexin, fourth, daughter, of, louis, vii, because, of, the, rivalry, between, the, kings, of, england, and, france, louis, obstructed, the, marriage, a, peace, treaty, was, secured, in, january, 1169, and, richard, s, betrothal, to, alys, was, confirmed,

fell, seriously, ill, in, 1170, he, enacted, his, plan, to, divide, his, territories, although, he, would, retain, overall, authority, over, his, sons, and, their, territories, his, son, henry, was, crowned, as, heir, apparent, in, june, 1170, and, in, 1171, richard, left, for, aquitaine, with, his, mother, and, henry, ii, gave, him, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, at, the, request, of, eleanor, richard, and, his, mother, embarked, on, a, tour, of, aquitaine, in, 1171, in, an, attempt, to, pacify, the, locals, together, they, laid, the, foundation, stone, of, st, augustine, s, monastery, in, limoges, in, june, 1172, at, age, 14, richard, was, formally, recognised, as, duke, of, aquitaine, and, count, of, poitou, when, he, was, granted, the, lance, and, banner, emblems, of, his, office, the, ceremony, took, place, in, poitiers, and, was, repeated, in, limoges, where, he, wore, the, ring, of, st, valerie, who, was, the, personification, of, aquitaine, according, to, ralph, of, coggeshall, henry, the, young, king, instigated, rebellion, against, henry, ii, he, wanted, to, reign, independently, over, at, least, part, of, the, territory, his, father, had, promised, him, and, to, break, away, from, his, dependence, on, henry, ii, who, controlled, the, purse, strings, there, were, rumors, that, eleanor, might, have, encouraged, her, sons, to, revolt, against, their, father, henry, the, young, king, abandoned, his, father, and, left, for, the, french, court, seeking, the, protection, of, louis, vii, his, brothers, richard, and, geoffrey, soon, followed, him, while, the, five, year, old, john, remained, in, england, louis, gave, his, support, to, the, three, brothers, and, even, knighted, richard, tying, them, together, through, vassalage, jordan, fantosme, a, contemporary, poet, described, the, rebellion, as, a, war, without, love, the, brothers, made, an, oath, at, the, french, court, that, they, would, not, make, terms, with, henry, ii, without, the, consent, of, louis, vii, and, the, french, barons, with, the, support, of, louis, henry, the, young, king, attracted, many, barons, to, his, cause, through, promises, of, land, and, money, one, such, baron, was, philip, i, count, of, flanders, who, was, promised, 1, 000, and, several, castles, the, brothers, also, had, supporters, ready, to, rise, up, in, england, robert, de, beaumont, 3rd, earl, of, leicester, joined, forces, with, hugh, bigod, 1st, earl, of, norfolk, hugh, de, kevelioc, 5th, earl, of, chester, and, william, i, of, scotland, for, a, rebellion, in, suffolk, the, alliance, with, louis, was, initially, successful, and, by, july, 1173, the, rebels, were, besieging, aumale, neuf, march, and, verneuil, and, hugh, de, kevelioc, had, captured, dol, in, brittany, richard, went, to, poitou, and, raised, the, barons, who, were, loyal, to, himself, and, his, mother, in, rebellion, against, his, father, eleanor, was, captured, so, richard, was, left, to, lead, his, campaign, against, henry, ii, s, supporters, in, aquitaine, on, his, own, he, marched, to, take, la, rochelle, but, was, rejected, by, the, inhabitants, he, withdrew, to, the, city, of, saintes, which, he, established, as, a, base, of, operations, in, the, meantime, henry, ii, had, raised, a, very, expensive, army, of, more, than, 20, 000, mercenaries, with, which, to, face, the, rebellion, he, marched, on, verneuil, and, louis, retreated, from, his, forces, the, army, proceeded, to, recapture, dol, and, subdued, brittany, at, this, point, henry, ii, made, an, offer, of, peace, to, his, sons, on, the, advice, of, louis, the, offer, was, refused, henry, ii, s, forces, took, saintes, by, surprise, and, captured, much, of, its, garrison, although, richard, was, able, to, escape, with, a, small, group, of, soldiers, he, took, refuge, in, ch, teau, de, taillebourg, for, the, rest, of, the, war, henry, the, young, king, and, the, count, of, flanders, planned, to, land, in, england, to, assist, the, rebellion, led, by, the, earl, of, leicester, anticipating, this, henry, ii, returned, to, england, with, 500, soldiers, and, his, prisoners, including, eleanor, and, his, sons, wives, and, fianc, es, but, on, his, arrival, found, out, that, the, rebellion, had, already, collapsed, william, i, of, scotland, and, hugh, bigod, were, captured, on, 13, and, 25, july, respectively, henry, ii, returned, to, france, and, raised, the, siege, of, rouen, where, louis, vii, had, been, joined, by, henry, the, young, king, after, abandoning, his, plan, to, invade, england, louis, was, defeated, and, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, in, september, 1174, the, treaty, of, montlouis, when, henry, ii, and, louis, vii, made, a, truce, on, 8, september, 1174, its, terms, specifically, excluded, richard, abandoned, by, louis, and, wary, of, facing, his, father, s, army, in, battle, richard, went, to, henry, ii, s, court, at, poitiers, on, 23, september, and, begged, for, forgiveness, weeping, and, falling, at, the, feet, of, henry, who, gave, richard, the, kiss, of, peace, several, days, later, richard, s, brothers, joined, him, in, seeking, reconciliation, with, their, father, the, terms, the, three, brothers, accepted, were, less, generous, than, those, they, had, been, offered, earlier, in, the, conflict, when, richard, was, offered, four, castles, in, aquitaine, and, half, of, the, income, from, the, duchy, richard, was, given, control, of, two, castles, in, poitou, and, half, the, income, of, aquitaine, henry, the, young, king, was, given, two, castles, in, normandy, and, geoffrey, was, permitted, half, of, brittany, eleanor, remained, henry, ii, s, prisoner, until, his, death, partly, as, insurance, for, richard, s, good, behaviour, after, the, conclusion, of, the, war, the, process, of, pacifying, the, provinces, that, had, rebelled, against, henry, ii, began, the, king, travelled, to, anjou, for, this, purpose, and, geoffrey, dealt, with, brittany, in, january, 1175, richard, was, dispatched, to, aquitaine, to, punish, the, barons, who, had, fought, for, him, the, historian, john, gillingham, notes, that, the, chronicle, of, roger, of, howden, is, the, main, source, for, richard, s, activities, in, this, period, according, to, the, chronicle, most, of, the, castles, belonging, to, rebels, were, to, be, returned, to, the, state, they, were, in, 15, days, before, the, outbreak, of, war, while, others, were, to, be, razed, given, that, by, this, time, it, was, common, for, castles, to, be, built, in, stone, and, that, many, barons, had, expanded, or, refortified, their, castles, this, was, not, an, easy, task, roger, of, howden, records, the, two, month, siege, of, castillon, sur, agen, while, the, castle, was, notoriously, strong, richard, s, siege, engines, battered, the, defenders, into, submission, on, this, campaign, richard, acquired, the, name, the, lion, or, the, lionheart, due, to, his, noble, brave, and, fierce, leadership, he, is, referred, to, as, this, our, lion, hic, leo, noster, as, early, as, 1187, in, the, topographia, hibernica, of, giraldus, cambrensis, while, the, byname, lionheart, le, quor, de, lion, is, first, recorded, in, ambroise, s, l, estoire, de, la, guerre, sainte, in, the, context, of, the, accon, campaign, of, 1191, henry, seemed, unwilling, to, entrust, any, of, his, sons, with, resources, that, could, be, used, against, him, it, was, suspected, that, the, king, had, appropriated, alys, of, france, richard, s, betrothed, as, his, mistress, this, made, a, marriage, between, richard, and, alys, technically, impossible, in, the, eyes, of, the, church, but, henry, prevaricated, he, regarded, alys, s, dowry, vexin, in, the, le, de, france, as, valuable, richard, was, discouraged, from, renouncing, alys, because, she, was, the, sister, of, king, philip, ii, of, france, a, close, ally, after, his, failure, to, overthrow, his, father, richard, concentrated, on, putting, down, internal, revolts, by, the, nobles, of, aquitaine, especially, in, the, territory, of, gascony, the, increasing, cruelty, of, his, rule, led, to, a, major, revolt, there, in, 1179, hoping, to, dethrone, richard, the, rebels, sought, the, help, of, his, brothers, henry, and, geoffrey, the, turning, point, came, in, the, charente, valley, in, the, spring, of, 1179, the, well, defended, fortress, of, taillebourg, seemed, impregnable, the, castle, was, surrounded, by, a, cliff, on, three, sides, and, a, town, on, the, fourth, side, with, a, three, layer, wall, richard, first, destroyed, and, looted, the, farms, and, lands, surrounding, the, fortress, leaving, its, defenders, no, reinforcements, or, lines, of, retreat, the, garrison, sallied, out, of, the, castle, and, attacked, richard, he, was, able, to, subdue, the, army, and, then, followed, the, defenders, inside, the, open, gates, where, he, easily, took, over, the, castle, in, two, days, richard, s, victory, at, taillebourg, deterred, many, barons, from, thinking, of, rebelling, and, forced, them, to, declare, their, loyalty, to, him, in, 1181, 82, richard, faced, a, revolt, over, the, succession, to, the, county, of, angoul, me, his, opponents, turned, to, philip, ii, of, france, for, support, and, the, fighting, spread, through, the, limousin, and, p, rigord, the, excessive, cruelty, of, richard, s, punitive, campaigns, aroused, even, more, hostility, after, richard, had, subdued, his, rebellious, barons, he, again, challenged, his, father, from, 1180, to, 1183, the, tension, between, henry, and, richard, grew, as, king, henry, commanded, richard, to, pay, homage, to, henry, the, young, king, but, richard, refused, finally, in, 1183, henry, the, young, king, and, geoffrey, duke, of, brittany, invaded, aquitaine, in, an, attempt, to, subdue, richard, richard, s, barons, joined, in, the, fray, and, turned, against, their, duke, however, richard, and, his, army, succeeded, in, holding, back, the, invading, armies, and, they, executed, any, prisoners, the, conflict, paused, briefly, in, june, 1183, when, the, young, king, died, with, the, death, of, henry, the, young, king, richard, became, the, eldest, surviving, son, and, therefore, heir, to, the, english, crown, king, henry, demanded, that, richard, give, up, aquitaine, which, he, planned, to, give, to, his, youngest, son, john, as, his, inheritance, richard, refused, and, conflict, continued, between, them, this, refusal, is, what, finally, made, henry, ii, bring, queen, eleanor, out, of, prison, he, sent, her, to, aquitaine, and, demanded, that, richard, give, up, his, lands, to, his, mother, who, would, once, again, rule, over, those, lands, in, 1187, to, strengthen, his, position, richard, allied, himself, with, 22, year, old, philip, ii, the, son, of, eleanor, s, ex, husband, louis, vii, by, adela, of, champagne, roger, of, howden, wrote, the, king, of, england, was, struck, with, great, astonishment, and, wondered, what, could, mean, and, taking, precautions, for, the, future, frequently, sent, messengers, into, france, for, the, purpose, of, recalling, his, son, richard, who, pretending, that, he, was, peaceably, inclined, and, ready, to, come, to, his, father, made, his, way, to, chinon, and, in, spite, of, the, person, who, had, the, custody, thereof, carried, off, the, greater, part, of, his, father, s, treasures, and, fortified, his, castles, in, poitou, with, the, same, refusing, to, go, to, his, father, overall, howden, is, chiefly, concerned, with, the, politics, of, the, relationship, between, richard, and, philip, gillingham, has, addressed, theories, suggesting, that, this, political, relationship, was, also, sexually, intimate, which, he, posits, probably, stemmed, from, an, official, record, announcing, that, as, a, symbol, of, unity, between, the, two, countries, the, kings, of, england, and, france, had, slept, overnight, in, the, same, bed, gillingham, has, characterized, this, as, an, accepted, political, act, nothing, sexual, about, it, a, bit, like, a, modern, day, photo, opportunity, with, news, arriving, of, the, battle, of, hattin, he, took, the, cross, at, tours, in, the, company, of, other, french, nobles, in, exchange, for, philip, s, help, against, his, father, richard, paid, homage, to, philip, in, november, 1188, on, 4, july, 1189, the, forces, of, richard, and, philip, defeated, henry, s, army, at, ballans, henry, agreed, to, name, richard, his, heir, apparent, two, days, later, henry, died, in, chinon, and, richard, succeeded, him, as, king, of, england, duke, of, normandy, and, count, of, anjou, roger, of, howden, claimed, that, henry, s, corpse, bled, from, the, nose, in, richard, s, presence, which, was, assumed, to, be, a, sign, that, richard, had, caused, his, death, richard, i, was, officially, invested, as, duke, of, normandy, on, 20, july, 1189, and, crowned, king, in, westminster, abbey, on, 3, september, 1189, tradition, barred, all, jews, and, women, from, the, investiture, but, some, jewish, leaders, arrived, to, present, gifts, for, the, new, king, according, to, ralph, of, diceto, richard, s, courtiers, stripped, and, flogged, the, jews, then, flung, them, out, of, court, when, a, rumour, spread, that, richard, had, ordered, all, jews, to, be, killed, the, people, of, london, attacked, the, jewish, population, many, jewish, homes, were, destroyed, by, arsonists, and, several, jews, were, forcibly, converted, some, sought, sanctuary, in, the, tower, of, london, and, others, managed, to, escape, among, those, killed, was, jacob, of, orl, ans, a, respected, jewish, scholar, roger, of, howden, in, his, gesta, regis, ricardi, claimed, that, the, jealous, and, bigoted, citizens, started, the, rioting, and, that, richard, punished, the, perpetrators, allowing, a, forcibly, converted, jew, to, return, to, his, native, religion, baldwin, of, forde, archbishop, of, canterbury, reacted, by, remarking, if, the, king, is, not, god, s, man, he, had, better, be, the, devil, s, offended, that, he, was, not, being, obeyed, and, aware, that, the, attacks, could, destabilise, his, realm, on, the, eve, of, his, departure, on, crusade, richard, ordered, the, execution, of, those, responsible, for, the, most, heinous, murders, and, persecutions, including, rioters, who, had, accidentally, burned, down, christian, homes, he, distributed, a, royal, writ, demanding, that, the, jews, be, left, alone, the, edict, was, only, loosely, enforced, however, and, the, following, march, further, violence, occurred, including, a, massacre, at, york, richard, had, already, taken, the, cross, as, count, of, poitou, in, 1187, his, father, and, philip, ii, had, done, so, at, gisors, on, 21, january, 1188, after, receiving, news, of, the, fall, of, jerusalem, to, saladin, after, richard, became, king, he, and, philip, agreed, to, go, on, the, third, crusade, since, each, feared, that, during, his, absence, the, other, might, usurp, his, territories, richard, swore, an, oath, to, renounce, his, past, wickedness, in, order, to, show, himself, worthy, to, take, the, cross, he, started, to, raise, and, equip, a, new, crusader, army, he, spent, most, of, his, father, s, treasury, filled, with, money, raised, by, the, saladin, tithe, raised, taxes, and, even, agreed, to, free, king, william, i, of, scotland, from, his, oath, of, subservience, to, richard, in, exchange, for, 10, 000, marks, 6, 500, to, raise, still, more, revenue, he, sold, the, right, to, hold, official, positions, lands, and, other, privileges, to, those, interested, in, them, those, already, appointed, were, forced, to, pay, huge, sums, to, retain, their, posts, william, longchamp, bishop, of, ely, and, the, king, s, chancellor, made, a, show, of, bidding, 3, 000, to, remain, as, chancellor, he, was, apparently, outbid, by, a, certain, reginald, the, italian, but, that, bid, was, refused, richard, made, some, final, arrangements, on, the, continent, he, reconfirmed, his, father, s, appointment, of, william, fitz, ralph, to, the, important, post, of, seneschal, of, normandy, in, anjou, stephen, of, tours, was, replaced, as, seneschal, and, temporarily, imprisoned, for, fiscal, mismanagement, payn, de, rochefort, an, angevin, knight, became, seneschal, of, anjou, in, poitou, the, ex, provost, of, benon, peter, bertin, was, made, seneschal, and, finally, the, household, official, helie, de, la, celle, was, picked, for, the, seneschalship, in, gascony, after, repositioning, the, part, of, his, army, he, left, behind, to, guard, his, french, possessions, richard, finally, set, out, on, the, crusade, in, summer, 1190, his, delay, was, criticised, by, troubadours, such, as, bertran, de, born, he, appointed, as, regents, hugh, de, puiset, bishop, of, durham, and, william, de, mandeville, 3rd, earl, of, essex, who, soon, died, and, was, replaced, by, william, longchamp, richard, s, brother, john, was, not, satisfied, by, this, decision, and, started, scheming, against, william, longchamp, when, richard, was, raising, funds, for, his, crusade, he, was, said, to, have, declared, i, would, have, sold, london, if, i, could, find, a, buyer, in, september, 1190, richard, and, philip, arrived, in, sicily, after, the, death, of, king, william, ii, of, sicily, in, 1189, his, cousin, tancred, had, seized, power, although, the, legal, heir, was, william, s, aunt, constance, wife, of, henry, vi, holy, roman, emperor, tancred, had, imprisoned, william, s, widow, queen, joan, who, was, richard, s, sister, and, did, not, give, her, the, money, she, had, inherited, in, william, s, will, when, richard, arrived, he, demanded, that, his, sister, be, released, and, given, her, inheritance, she, was, freed, on, 28, september, but, without, the, inheritance, the, presence, of, foreign, troops, also, caused, unrest, in, october, the, people, of, messina, revolted, demanding, that, the, foreigners, leave, richard, attacked, messina, capturing, it, on, 4, october, 1190, after, looting, and, burning, the, city, richard, established, his, base, there, but, this, created, tension, between, richard, and, philip, he, remained, there, until, tancred, finally, agreed, to, sign, a, treaty, on, 4, march, 1191, the, treaty, was, signed, by, richard, philip, and, tancred, its, main, terms, were, the, two, kings, stayed, in, sicily, for, a, while, but, this, resulted, in, increasing, tensions, between, them, and, their, men, with, philip, plotting, with, tancred, against, richard, the, two, kings, eventually, met, to, clear, the, air, and, reached, an, agreement, including, the, end, of, richard, s, betrothal, to, philip, s, sister, alys, in, 1190, king, richard, before, leaving, for, the, holy, land, for, the, crusade, met, joachim, of, fiore, who, spoke, to, him, of, a, prophecy, contained, in, the, book, of, revelation, in, april, 1191, richard, left, messina, for, acre, with, an, army, of, 17, 000, men, but, a, storm, dispersed, his, large, fleet, after, some, searching, it, was, discovered, that, the, ship, carrying, his, sister, joan, and, his, new, fianc, e, berengaria, of, navarre, was, anchored, on, the, south, coast, of, cyprus, along, with, the, wrecks, of, several, other, vessels, including, the, treasure, ship, survivors, of, the, wrecks, had, been, taken, prisoner, by, the, island, s, ruler, isaac, komnenos, on, 1, may, 1191, richard, s, fleet, arrived, in, the, port, of, lemesos, on, cyprus, he, ordered, isaac, to, release, the, prisoners, and, treasure, isaac, refused, so, richard, landed, his, troops, and, took, lemesos, various, princes, of, the, holy, land, arrived, in, lemesos, at, the, same, time, in, particular, guy, of, lusignan, all, declared, their, support, for, richard, provided, that, he, support, guy, against, his, rival, conrad, of, montferrat, the, local, magnates, abandoned, isaac, who, considered, making, peace, with, richard, joining, him, on, the, crusade, and, offering, his, daughter, in, marriage, to, the, person, named, by, richard, isaac, changed, his, mind, however, and, tried, to, escape, richard, s, troops, led, by, guy, de, lusignan, conquered, the, whole, island, by, 1, june, isaac, surrendered, and, was, confined, with, silver, chains, because, richard, had, promised, that, he, would, not, place, him, in, irons, richard, named, richard, de, camville, and, robert, of, thornham, as, governors, he, later, sold, the, island, to, the, master, of, knights, templar, robert, de, sabl, and, it, was, subsequently, acquired, in, 1192, by, guy, of, lusignan, and, became, a, stable, feudal, kingdom, the, rapid, conquest, of, the, island, by, richard, was, of, strategic, importance, the, island, occupies, a, key, strategic, position, on, the, maritime, lanes, to, the, holy, land, whose, occupation, by, the, christians, could, not, continue, without, support, from, the, sea, cyprus, remained, a, christian, stronghold, until, the, ottoman, invasion, in, 1570, richard, s, exploit, was, well, publicised, and, contributed, to, his, reputation, and, he, also, derived, significant, financial, gains, from, the, conquest, of, the, island, richard, left, cyprus, for, acre, on, 5, june, with, his, allies, before, leaving, cyprus, on, crusade, richard, married, berengaria, the, first, born, daughter, of, king, sancho, vi, of, navarre, richard, had, first, grown, close, to, her, at, a, tournament, held, in, her, native, navarre, the, wedding, was, held, in, lemesos, on, 12, may, 1191, at, the, chapel, of, st, george, and, was, attended, by, richard, s, sister, joan, whom, he, had, brought, from, sicily, the, marriage, was, celebrated, with, great, pomp, and, splendour, many, feasts, and, entertainments, and, public, parades, and, celebrations, followed, commemorating, the, event, when, richard, married, berengaria, he, was, still, officially, betrothed, to, alys, and, he, pushed, for, the, match, in, order, to, obtain, the, kingdom, of, navarre, as, a, fief, as, aquitaine, had, been, for, his, father, further, eleanor, championed, the, match, as, navarre, bordered, aquitaine, thereby, securing, the, southern, border, of, her, ancestral, lands, richard, took, his, new, wife, on, crusade, with, him, briefly, though, they, returned, separately, berengaria, had, almost, as, much, difficulty, in, making, the, journey, home, as, her, husband, did, and, she, did, not, see, england, until, after, his, death, after, his, release, from, german, captivity, richard, showed, some, regret, for, his, earlier, conduct, but, he, was, not, reunited, with, his, wife, the, marriage, remained, childless, richard, landed, at, acre, on, 8, june, 1191, he, gave, his, support, to, his, poitevin, vassal, guy, of, lusignan, who, had, brought, troops, to, help, him, in, cyprus, guy, was, the, widower, of, his, father, s, cousin, sibylla, of, jerusalem, and, was, trying, to, retain, the, kingship, of, jerusalem, despite, his, wife, s, death, during, the, siege, of, acre, the, previous, year, guy, s, claim, was, challenged, by, conrad, of, montferrat, second, husband, of, sibylla, s, half, sister, isabella, conrad, whose, defence, of, tyre, had, saved, the, kingdom, in, 1187, was, supported, by, philip, of, france, son, of, his, first, cousin, louis, vii, of, france, and, by, another, cousin, leopold, v, duke, of, austria, richard, also, allied, with, humphrey, iv, of, toron, isabella, s, first, husband, from, whom, she, had, been, forcibly, divorced, in, 1190, humphrey, was, loyal, to, guy, and, spoke, arabic, fluently, so, richard, used, him, as, a, translator, and, negotiator, richard, and, his, forces, aided, in, the, capture, of, acre, despite, richard, s, serious, illness, at, one, point, while, sick, from, arnaldia, a, disease, similar, to, scurvy, he, picked, off, guards, on, the, walls, with, a, crossbow, while, being, carried, on, a, stretcher, covered, in, a, great, silken, quilt, eventually, conrad, of, montferrat, concluded, the, surrender, negotiations, with, saladin, s, forces, inside, acre, and, raised, the, banners, of, the, kings, in, the, city, richard, quarrelled, with, leopold, over, the, deposition, of, isaac, komnenos, related, to, leopold, s, byzantine, mother, and, his, position, within, the, crusade, leopold, s, banner, had, been, raised, alongside, the, english, and, french, standards, this, was, interpreted, as, arrogance, by, both, richard, and, philip, as, leopold, was, a, vassal, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, although, he, was, the, highest, ranking, surviving, leader, of, the, imperial, forces, richard, s, men, tore, the, flag, down, and, threw, it, in, the, moat, of, acre, leopold, left, the, crusade, immediately, philip, also, left, soon, afterwards, in, poor, health, and, after, further, disputes, with, richard, over, the, status, of, cyprus, philip, demanded, half, the, island, and, the, kingship, of, jerusalem, richard, suddenly, found, himself, without, allies, richard, had, kept, 2, 700, muslim, prisoners, as, hostages, against, saladin, fulfilling, all, the, terms, of, the, surrender, of, the, lands, around, acre, philip, before, leaving, had, entrusted, his, prisoners, to, conrad, but, richard, forced, him, to, hand, them, over, to, him, richard, feared, his, forces, being, bottled, up, in, acre, as, he, believed, his, campaign, could, not, advance, with, the, prisoners, in, train, he, therefore, ordered, all, the, prisoners, executed, he, then, moved, south, defeating, saladin, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, arsuf, 30, miles, 50, km, north, of, jaffa, on, 7, september, 1191, saladin, attempted, to, harass, richard, s, army, into, breaking, its, formation, in, order, to, defeat, it, in, detail, richard, maintained, his, army, s, defensive, formation, however, until, the, hospitallers, broke, ranks, to, charge, the, right, wing, of, saladin, s, forces, richard, then, ordered, a, general, counterattack, which, won, the, battle, arsuf, was, an, important, victory, the, muslim, army, was, not, destroyed, despite, the, considerable, casualties, it, suffered, but, it, did, rout, this, was, considered, shameful, by, the, muslims, and, boosted, the, morale, of, the, crusaders, in, november, 1191, following, the, fall, of, jaffa, the, crusader, army, advanced, inland, towards, jerusalem, the, army, then, marched, to, beit, nuba, only, 12, miles, 19, km, from, jerusalem, muslim, morale, in, jerusalem, was, so, low, that, the, arrival, of, the, crusaders, would, probably, have, caused, the, city, to, fall, quickly, however, the, weather, was, appallingly, bad, cold, with, heavy, rain, and, hailstorms, this, combined, with, the, fear, that, the, crusader, army, if, it, besieged, jerusalem, might, be, trapped, by, a, relieving, force, led, to, the, decision, to, retreat, back, to, the, coast, richard, attempted, to, negotiate, with, saladin, but, this, was, unsuccessful, in, the, first, half, of, 1192, he, and, his, troops, refortified, ascalon, an, election, forced, richard, to, accept, conrad, of, montferrat, as, king, of, jerusalem, and, he, sold, cyprus, to, his, defeated, prot, g, guy, only, days, later, on, 28, april, 1192, conrad, was, stabbed, to, death, by, the, assassins, before, he, could, be, crowned, eight, days, later, richard, s, own, nephew, henry, ii, of, champagne, was, married, to, the, widowed, isabella, although, she, was, carrying, conrad, s, child, the, murder, was, never, conclusively, solved, and, richard, s, contemporaries, widely, suspected, his, involvement, the, crusader, army, made, another, advance, on, jerusalem, and, in, june, 1192, it, came, within, sight, of, the, city, before, being, forced, to, retreat, once, again, this, time, because, of, dissension, amongst, its, leaders, in, particular, richard, and, the, majority, of, the, army, council, wanted, to, force, saladin, to, relinquish, jerusalem, by, attacking, the, basis, of, his, power, through, an, invasion, of, egypt, the, leader, of, the, french, contingent, hugh, iii, duke, of, burgundy, however, was, adamant, that, a, direct, attack, on, jerusalem, should, be, made, this, split, the, crusader, army, into, two, factions, and, neither, was, strong, enough, to, achieve, its, objective, richard, stated, that, he, would, accompany, any, attack, on, jerusalem, but, only, as, a, simple, soldier, he, refused, to, lead, the, army, without, a, united, command, the, army, had, little, choice, but, to, retreat, back, to, the, coast, a, period, of, minor, skirmishes, with, saladin, s, forces, commenced, punctuated, by, another, defeat, in, the, field, for, the, ayyubid, army, at, the, battle, of, jaffa, baha, al, din, a, contemporary, muslim, soldier, and, biographer, of, saladin, recorded, a, tribute, to, richard, s, martial, prowess, at, this, battle, i, have, been, assured, that, on, that, day, the, king, of, england, lance, in, hand, rode, along, the, whole, length, of, our, army, from, right, to, left, and, not, one, of, our, soldiers, left, the, ranks, to, attack, him, the, sultan, was, wroth, thereat, and, left, the, battlefield, in, anger, both, sides, realised, that, their, respective, positions, were, growing, untenable, richard, knew, that, both, philip, and, his, own, brother, john, were, starting, to, plot, against, him, and, the, morale, of, saladin, s, army, had, been, badly, eroded, by, repeated, defeats, however, saladin, insisted, on, the, razing, of, ascalon, s, fortifications, which, richard, s, men, had, rebuilt, and, a, few, other, points, richard, made, one, last, attempt, to, strengthen, his, bargaining, position, by, attempting, to, invade, egypt, saladin, s, chief, supply, base, but, failed, in, the, end, time, ran, out, for, richard, he, realised, that, his, return, could, be, postponed, no, longer, since, both, philip, and, john, were, taking, advantage, of, his, absence, he, and, saladin, finally, came, to, a, settlement, on, 2, september, 1192, the, terms, provided, for, the, destruction, of, ascalon, s, fortifications, allowed, christian, pilgrims, and, merchants, access, to, jerusalem, and, initiated, a, three, year, truce, richard, being, ill, with, arnaldia, left, for, england, on, 9, october, 1192, bad, weather, forced, richard, s, ship, to, put, in, at, corfu, in, the, lands, of, byzantine, emperor, isaac, ii, angelos, who, objected, to, richard, s, annexation, of, cyprus, formerly, byzantine, territory, disguised, as, a, knight, templar, richard, sailed, from, corfu, with, four, attendants, but, his, ship, was, wrecked, near, aquileia, forcing, richard, and, his, party, into, taking, a, dangerous, land, route, through, central, europe, on, his, way, to, the, territory, of, his, brother, in, law, henry, the, lion, richard, was, captured, shortly, before, christmas, 1192, near, vienna, by, leopold, of, austria, who, accused, richard, of, arranging, the, murder, of, his, cousin, conrad, of, montferrat, moreover, richard, had, personally, offended, leopold, by, casting, down, his, standard, from, the, walls, of, acre, leopold, kept, richard, prisoner, at, d, rnstein, castle, under, the, care, of, leopold, s, ministerialis, hadmar, of, kuenring, this, mishap, was, soon, known, in, england, but, the, regents, were, for, some, weeks, uncertain, of, his, whereabouts, while, in, prison, richard, wrote, the, musical, piece, ja, nus, hons, pris, or, ja, nuls, om, pres, no, man, who, is, imprisoned, which, is, addressed, to, his, half, sister, marie, he, wrote, the, song, in, french, and, occitan, versions, to, express, his, feelings, of, abandonment, by, his, people, and, his, sister, the, detention, of, a, crusader, was, contrary, to, public, law, and, on, these, grounds, pope, celestine, iii, excommunicated, leopold, on, 28, march, 1193, richard, was, brought, to, speyer, and, handed, over, to, holy, roman, emperor, henry, vi, who, imprisoned, him, in, trifels, castle, the, emperor, was, aggrieved, by, the, support, the, plantagenets, had, given, to, the, family, of, henry, the, lion, and, by, richard, s, recognition, of, tancred, in, sicily, henry, vi, needed, money, to, raise, an, army, and, assert, his, rights, over, southern, italy, and, continued, to, hold, richard, for, ransom, nevertheless, to, richard, s, irritation, pope, celestine, hesitated, to, excommunicate, henry, vi, as, he, had, duke, leopold, for, the, continued, wrongful, imprisonment, of, richard, he, famously, refused, to, show, deference, to, the, emperor, and, declared, to, him, i, am, born, of, a, rank, which, recognises, no, superior, but, god, the, king, was, at, first, shown, a, certain, measure, of, respect, but, later, at, the, prompting, of, philip, of, dreux, bishop, of, beauvais, and, philip, of, france, s, cousin, the, conditions, of, richard, s, captivity, worsened, and, he, was, kept, in, chains, so, heavy, richard, declared, that, a, horse, or, ass, would, have, struggled, to, move, under, them, the, emperor, demanded, that, 150, 000, marks, 100, 000, pounds, of, silver, be, delivered, to, him, before, he, would, release, the, king, the, same, amount, raised, by, the, saladin, tithe, only, a, few, years, earlier, and, two, to, three, times, the, annual, income, of, the, english, crown, under, richard, meanwhile, eleanor, worked, tirelessly, to, raise, the, ransom, for, her, son, s, release, leopold, also, requested, eleanor, fair, maid, of, brittany, niece, of, richard, marry, his, heir, frederick, both, clergy, and, laymen, were, taxed, for, a, quarter, of, the, value, of, their, property, the, gold, and, silver, treasures, of, the, churches, were, confiscated, and, money, was, raised, from, the, scutage, and, the, carucage, taxes, at, the, same, time, richard, s, brother, john, and, king, philip, of, france, offered, 80, 000, marks, for, henry, vi, to, hold, richard, prisoner, until, michaelmas, 1194, henry, turned, down, the, offer, the, money, to, release, the, king, was, transferred, to, germany, by, the, emperor, s, ambassadors, but, at, the, king, s, peril, had, it, been, lost, along, the, way, richard, would, have, been, held, responsible, and, finally, on, 4, february, 1194, richard, was, released, philip, sent, a, message, to, john, look, to, yourself, the, devil, is, loose, furthermore, upon, the, sudden, death, of, leopold, under, the, pressure, of, the, pope, the, new, duke, frederick, was, forced, to, abandon, his, marriage, plan, with, eleanor, of, brittany, in, richard, s, absence, his, brother, john, revolted, with, the, aid, of, philip, amongst, philip, s, conquests, in, the, period, of, richard, s, imprisonment, was, a, part, of, normandy, called, norman, vexin, facing, french, vexin, richard, forgave, john, when, they, met, again, and, named, him, as, his, heir, in, place, of, their, nephew, arthur, at, winchester, on, 11, march, 1194, richard, was, crowned, a, second, time, to, nullify, the, shame, of, his, captivity, richard, began, his, reconquest, of, the, lost, lands, in, normandy, the, fall, of, the, ch, teau, de, gisors, to, the, french, in, 1193, opened, a, gap, in, the, norman, defences, the, search, began, for, a, fresh, site, for, a, new, castle, to, defend, the, duchy, of, normandy, and, act, as, a, base, from, which, richard, could, launch, his, campaign, to, take, back, vexin, from, french, control, a, naturally, defensible, position, was, identified, perched, high, above, the, river, seine, an, important, transport, route, in, the, manor, of, andeli, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, louviers, december, 1195, between, richard, and, philip, ii, neither, king, was, allowed, to, fortify, the, site, despite, this, richard, intended, to, build, the, vast, ch, teau, gaillard, richard, tried, to, obtain, the, manor, through, negotiation, walter, de, coutances, archbishop, of, rouen, was, reluctant, to, sell, the, manor, as, it, was, one, of, the, diocese, s, most, profitable, and, other, lands, belonging, to, the, diocese, had, recently, been, damaged, by, war, when, philip, besieged, aumale, in, normandy, richard, grew, tired, of, waiting, and, seized, the, manor, although, the, act, was, opposed, by, the, catholic, church, the, archbishop, issued, an, interdict, against, performing, church, services, in, the, duchy, of, normandy, roger, of, howden, detailed, unburied, bodies, of, the, dead, lying, in, the, streets, and, square, of, the, cities, of, normandy, the, interdict, was, still, in, force, when, work, began, on, the, castle, but, pope, celestine, iii, repealed, it, in, april, 1197, after, richard, made, gifts, of, land, to, the, archbishop, and, the, diocese, of, rouen, including, two, manors, and, the, prosperous, port, of, dieppe, royal, expenditure, on, castles, declined, from, the, levels, spent, under, henry, ii, attributed, to, a, concentration, of, resources, on, richard, s, war, with, the, king, of, france, however, the, work, at, ch, teau, gaillard, was, some, of, the, most, expensive, of, its, time, and, cost, an, estimated, 15, 000, to, 20, 000, between, 1196, and, 1198, this, was, more, than, double, richard, s, spending, on, castles, in, england, an, estimated, 7, 000, unprecedented, in, its, speed, of, construction, the, castle, was, mostly, complete, in, two, years, when, most, construction, on, such, a, scale, would, have, taken, the, better, part, of, a, decade, according, to, william, of, newburgh, in, may, 1198, richard, and, the, labourers, working, on, the, castle, were, drenched, in, a, rain, of, blood, while, some, of, his, advisers, thought, the, rain, was, an, evil, omen, richard, was, undeterred, as, no, master, mason, is, mentioned, in, the, otherwise, detailed, records, of, the, castle, s, construction, military, historian, richard, allen, brown, has, suggested, that, richard, himself, was, the, overall, architect, this, is, supported, by, the, interest, richard, showed, in, the, work, through, his, frequent, presence, in, his, final, years, the, castle, became, richard, s, favourite, residence, and, writs, and, charters, were, written, at, ch, teau, gaillard, bearing, apud, bellum, castrum, de, rupe, at, the, fair, castle, of, the, rock, ch, teau, gaillard, was, ahead, of, its, time, featuring, innovations, that, would, be, adopted, in, castle, architecture, nearly, a, century, later, allen, brown, described, ch, teau, gaillard, as, one, of, the, finest, castles, in, europe, and, military, historian, sir, charles, oman, wrote, that, it, was, considered, the, masterpiece, of, its, time, the, reputation, of, its, builder, c, ur, de, lion, as, a, great, military, engineer, might, stand, firm, on, this, single, structure, he, was, no, mere, copyist, of, the, models, he, had, seen, in, the, east, but, introduced, many, original, details, of, his, own, invention, into, the, stronghold, determined, to, resist, philip, s, designs, on, contested, angevin, lands, such, as, the, vexin, and, berry, richard, poured, all, his, military, expertise, and, vast, resources, into, the, war, on, the, french, king, he, organised, an, alliance, against, philip, including, baldwin, ix, of, flanders, renaud, count, of, boulogne, and, his, father, in, law, king, sancho, vi, of, navarre, who, raided, philip, s, lands, from, the, south, most, importantly, he, managed, to, secure, the, welf, inheritance, in, saxony, for, his, nephew, henry, the, lion, s, son, who, was, elected, otto, iv, of, germany, in, 1198, partly, as, a, result, of, these, and, other, intrigues, richard, won, several, victories, over, philip, at, fr, teval, in, 1194, just, after, richard, s, return, to, france, from, captivity, and, money, raising, in, england, philip, fled, leaving, his, entire, archive, of, financial, audits, and, documents, to, be, captured, by, richard, at, the, battle, of, gisors, sometimes, called, courcelles, in, 1198, richard, took, dieu, et, mon, droit, god, and, my, right, as, his, motto, still, used, by, the, british, monarchy, today, echoing, his, earlier, boast, to, emperor, henry, that, his, rank, acknowledged, no, superior, but, god, in, march, 1199, richard, was, in, limousin, suppressing, a, revolt, by, viscount, aimar, v, of, limoges, although, it, was, lent, he, devastated, the, viscount, s, land, with, fire, and, sword, he, besieged, the, tiny, virtually, unarmed, castle, of, ch, lus, chabrol, some, chroniclers, claimed, that, this, was, because, a, local, peasant, had, uncovered, a, treasure, trove, of, roman, gold, on, 26, march, 1199, richard, was, hit, in, the, shoulder, by, a, crossbow, bolt, and, the, wound, turned, gangrenous, richard, asked, to, have, the, crossbowman, brought, before, him, called, alternatively, pierre, or, peter, basile, john, sabroz, dudo, and, bertrand, de, gourdon, from, the, town, of, gourdon, by, chroniclers, the, man, turned, out, according, to, some, sources, but, not, all, to, be, a, boy, he, said, richard, had, killed, his, father, and, two, brothers, and, that, he, had, intended, to, kill, richard, in, revenge, he, expected, to, be, executed, but, as, a, final, act, of, mercy, richard, forgave, him, saying, live, on, and, by, my, bounty, behold, the, light, of, day, before, he, ordered, the, boy, to, be, freed, and, sent, away, with, 100, shillings, richard, died, on, 6, april, 1199, in, the, arms, of, his, mother, and, thus, ended, his, earthly, day, because, of, the, nature, of, his, death, it, was, later, said, that, the, lion, by, the, ant, was, slain, according, to, one, chronicler, richard, s, last, act, of, chivalry, proved, fruitless, when, the, infamous, mercenary, captain, mercadier, had, the, boy, flayed, alive, and, hanged, as, soon, as, richard, died, richard, s, heart, was, buried, at, rouen, in, normandy, his, entrails, in, ch, lus, where, he, died, and, the, rest, of, his, body, at, the, feet, of, his, father, at, fontevraud, abbey, in, anjou, in, 2012, scientists, analysed, the, remains, of, richard, s, heart, and, found, that, it, had, been, embalmed, with, various, substances, including, frankincense, a, symbolically, important, substance, because, it, had, been, present, both, at, the, birth, and, embalming, of, christ, henry, sandford, bishop, of, rochester, 1226, 1235, announced, that, he, had, seen, a, vision, of, richard, ascending, to, heaven, in, march, 1232, along, with, stephen, langton, the, former, archbishop, of, canterbury, the, king, having, presumably, spent, 33, years, in, purgatory, as, expiation, for, his, sins, richard, produced, no, legitimate, heirs, and, acknowledged, only, one, illegitimate, son, philip, of, cognac, he, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, john, as, king, his, french, territories, with, the, exception, of, rouen, initially, rejected, john, as, a, successor, preferring, his, nephew, arthur, the, lack, of, any, direct, heirs, from, richard, was, the, first, step, in, the, dissolution, of, the, angevin, empire, contemporaries, considered, richard, as, both, a, king, and, a, knight, famed, for, personal, martial, prowess, this, was, apparently, the, first, such, instance, of, this, combination, he, was, known, as, a, valiant, competent, military, leader, and, individual, fighter, who, was, courageous, and, generous, at, the, same, time, he, was, considered, prone, to, the, sins, of, lust, pride, greed, and, above, all, excessive, cruelty, ralph, of, coggeshall, summarising, richard, s, career, deplores, that, the, king, was, one, of, the, immense, cohort, of, sinners, he, was, criticised, by, clergy, chroniclers, for, having, taxed, the, clergy, both, for, the, crusade, and, for, his, ransom, whereas, the, church, and, the, clergy, were, usually, exempt, from, taxes, richard, was, a, patron, and, a, protector, of, the, trouv, res, and, troubadours, of, his, entourage, he, was, also, a, poet, himself, he, was, interested, in, writing, and, music, and, two, poems, are, attributed, to, him, the, first, one, is, a, sirventes, in, old, french, dalfin, je, us, voill, desrenier, and, the, second, one, is, a, lament, that, he, wrote, during, his, imprisonment, at, d, rnstein, castle, ja, nus, hons, pris, with, a, version, in, old, occitan, and, a, version, in, old, french, in, the, historiography, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, much, interest, was, shown, in, richard, s, sexuality, in, particular, whether, there, was, evidence, of, homosexuality, the, topic, had, not, been, raised, by, victorian, or, edwardian, historians, a, fact, denounced, as, a, conspiracy, of, silence, by, john, harvey, 1948, the, argument, primarily, drew, on, accounts, of, richard, s, behaviour, as, well, as, of, his, confessions, and, penitences, and, of, his, childless, marriage, richard, did, have, at, least, one, illegitimate, child, philip, of, cognac, and, there, are, reports, on, his, sexual, relations, with, local, women, during, his, campaigns, historians, remain, divided, on, the, question, of, richard, s, sexuality, harvey, argued, in, favour, of, his, homosexuality, but, has, been, disputed, by, other, historians, most, notably, john, gillingham, 1994, who, argues, that, richard, was, probably, heterosexual, flori, 1999, again, argued, in, favour, of, richard, s, homosexuality, based, on, richard, s, two, public, confessions, and, penitences, in, 1191, and, 1195, which, according, to, flori, must, have, referred, to, the, sin, of, sodomy, but, flori, concedes, that, contemporary, accounts, of, richard, taking, women, by, force, exist, concluding, that, he, probably, had, sexual, relations, with, both, men, and, women, flori, and, gillingham, nevertheless, agree, that, accounts, of, bed, sharing, do, not, support, the, suggestion, that, richard, had, a, sexual, relationship, with, king, philip, ii, as, other, modern, authors, had, suggested, the, second, great, seal, of, richard, i, 1198, shows, him, bearing, a, shield, depicting, three, lions, passant, guardant, this, is, the, first, instance, of, the, appearance, of, this, blazon, which, later, became, established, as, the, royal, arms, of, england, it, is, likely, therefore, that, richard, introduced, this, heraldic, design, in, his, earlier, great, seal, of, 1189, he, had, used, either, one, lion, rampant, or, two, lions, rampants, combatants, arms, which, he, may, have, adopted, from, his, father, richard, is, also, credited, with, having, originated, the, english, crest, of, a, lion, statant, now, statant, guardant, the, coat, of, three, lions, continues, to, represent, england, on, several, coins, of, the, pound, sterling, forms, the, basis, of, several, emblems, of, english, national, sports, teams, such, as, the, england, national, football, team, and, the, team, s, three, lions, anthem, and, endures, as, one, of, the, most, recognisable, national, symbols, of, england, around, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, various, legends, developed, that, after, richard, s, capture, his, minstrel, blondel, travelled, europe, from, castle, to, castle, loudly, singing, a, song, known, only, to, the, two, of, them, they, had, composed, it, together, eventually, he, came, to, the, place, where, richard, was, being, held, and, richard, heard, the, song, and, answered, with, the, appropriate, refrain, thus, revealing, where, the, king, was, incarcerated, the, story, was, the, basis, of, andr, ernest, modeste, gr, try, s, opera, richard, c, ur, de, lion, and, seems, to, be, the, inspiration, for, the, opening, to, richard, thorpe, s, film, version, of, ivanhoe, it, seems, unconnected, to, the, real, jean, blondel, de, nesle, an, aristocratic, trouv, re, it, also, does, not, correspond, to, the, historical, reality, since, the, king, s, jailers, did, not, hide, the, fact, on, the, contrary, they, publicised, it, an, early, account, of, this, legend, is, to, be, found, in, claude, fauchet, s, recueil, de, l, origine, de, la, langue, et, poesie, fran, oise, 1581, at, some, time, around, the, 16th, century, tales, of, robin, hood, started, to, mention, him, as, a, contemporary, and, supporter, of, king, richard, the, lionheart, robin, being, driven, to, outlawry, during, the, misrule, of, richard, s, evil, brother, john, while, richard, was, away, at, the, third, crusade, richard, s, reputation, over, the, years, has, fluctuated, wildly, according, to, historian, john, gillingham, according, to, gillingham, richard, s, reputation, above, all, as, a, crusader, meant, that, the, tone, of, contemporaries, and, near, contemporaries, whether, writing, in, the, west, or, the, middle, east, was, overwhelmingly, favourable, even, historians, attached, to, the, court, of, his, enemy, philip, augustus, believed, that, if, richard, had, not, fought, against, philip, then, england, would, never, have, had, a, better, king, a, german, contemporary, walther, von, der, vogelweide, believed, that, richard, s, generosity, was, what, made, his, subjects, willing, to, raise, a, king, s, ransom, on, his, behalf, richard, s, character, was, also, praised, by, figures, in, saladin, s, court, such, as, baha, ad, din, and, ibn, al, athir, who, judged, him, the, most, remarkable, ruler, of, his, time, even, in, scotland, he, won, a, high, place, in, historical, tradition, after, richard, s, death, his, image, was, further, romanticized, and, for, at, least, four, centuries, richard, was, considered, a, model, king, by, historians, such, as, holinshed, and, john, speed, however, in, 1621, the, stuart, courtier, and, poet, and, historian, samuel, daniel, criticized, richard, for, wasting, english, resources, on, the, crusade, and, wars, in, france, this, remarkably, original, and, consciously, anachronistic, interpretation, eventually, became, the, common, opinion, of, scholars, though, richard, s, popular, image, tended, to, be, dominated, by, the, positive, qualities, of, chivalry, and, military, competence, his, reputation, among, historians, was, typified, by, steven, runciman, s, verdict, he, was, a, bad, son, a, bad, husband, and, a, bad, king, but, a, gallant, and, splendid, soldier, history, of, the, crusades, vol, iii, victorian, england, was, divided, on, richard, many, admired, him, as, a, crusader, and, man, of, god, erecting, an, heroic, statue, to, him, outside, the, houses, of, parliament, the, late, victorian, scholar, william, stubbs, however, thought, him, a, bad, son, a, bad, husband, a, selfish, ruler, and, a, vicious, man, during, his, ten, years, reign, richard, was, in, england, for, no, more, than, six, months, and, totally, absent, for, the, last, five, years, which, led, to, stubbs, argue, that, richard, had, no, sympathy, or, even, consideration, for, his, people, he, was, no, englishman, and, his, ambition, was, that, of, a, mere, warrior, however, since, 1978, this, approach, has, been, increasingly, questioned, for, its, insularity, according, to, gillingham, it, is, now, more, widely, acknowledged, that, richard, was, head, of, a, dynasty, with, far, wider, responsibilities, than, merely, english, ones, and, that, in, judging, a, ruler, s, political, acumen, more, weight, might, be, attached, to, contemporary, opinion, than, to, views, which, occurred, to, no, one, until, many, centuries, after, his, death, in, world, war, i, when, british, troops, commanded, by, general, edmund, allenby, captured, jerusalem, the, british, press, printed, cartoons, of, richard, looking, down, from, the, heavens, with, the, caption, reading, at, last, my, dream, has, come, true, general, allenby, protested, against, his, campaign, being, presented, as, a, latter, day, crusade, stating, the, importance, of, jerusalem, lay, in, its, strategic, importance, there, was, no, religious, impulse, in, this, campaign, category
