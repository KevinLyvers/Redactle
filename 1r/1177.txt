stopped, in, thessaloniki, where, they, swore, oaths, to, uphold, the, treaty, that, conrad, had, agreed, with, emperor, manuel, i, komnenos, the, previous, winter, this, treaty, obligated, the, germans, to, attack, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, in, cooperation, with, the, byzantines, after, confirming, the, treaty, frederick, was, sent, ahead, to, germany, he, passed, through, bulgaria, and, hungary, and, arrived, in, germany, in, april, 1149, when, conrad, died, in, february, 1152, only, frederick, and, the, prince, bishop, of, bamberg, were, at, his, deathbed, both, asserted, afterwards, that, conrad, had, in, full, possession, of, his, mental, faculties, handed, the, royal, insignia, to, frederick, and, indicated, that, he, rather, than, conrad, s, own, six, year, old, son, the, future, frederick, iv, duke, of, swabia, succeed, him, as, king, frederick, energetically, pursued, the, crown, and, at, frankfurt, on, 4, march, 1152, the, kingdom, s, princely, electors, designated, him, as, the, next, german, king, he, was, crowned, king, of, the, romans, at, aachen, several, days, later, on, 9, march, 1152, the, reigns, of, henry, iv, and, henry, v, left, the, status, of, the, german, empire, in, disarray, its, power, waning, under, the, weight, of, the, investiture, controversy, for, a, quarter, of, a, century, following, the, death, of, henry, v, in, 1125, the, german, monarchy, was, largely, a, nominal, title, with, no, real, power, behind, it, the, king, chosen, by, the, prince, electors, was, given, no, resources, outside, those, of, his, own, duchy, and, he, was, at, the, same, time, prevented, from, exercising, any, real, authority, or, leadership, the, royal, title, was, furthermore, passed, from, one, family, to, another, to, preclude, the, development, of, any, dynastic, interest, in, the, german, crown, when, frederick, was, chosen, as, king, in, 1152, royal, power, had, been, in, effective, abeyance, for, over, twenty, five, years, and, to, a, considerable, degree, for, more, than, eighty, years, the, only, real, claim, to, wealth, lay, in, the, rich, cities, of, northern, italy, which, were, still, within, the, nominal, control, of, the, german, king, the, salian, line, had, died, out, with, the, death, of, henry, v, in, 1125, and, the, german, princes, refused, to, give, the, crown, to, his, nephew, the, duke, of, swabia, for, fear, he, would, try, to, regain, the, imperial, power, held, by, henry, v, instead, they, chose, lothair, iii, 1125, 1137, who, found, himself, embroiled, in, a, long, running, dispute, with, the, hohenstaufens, and, who, married, into, the, welfs, one, of, the, hohenstaufens, gained, the, throne, as, conrad, iii, of, germany, 1137, 1152, when, frederick, barbarossa, succeeded, his, uncle, in, 1152, there, seemed, to, be, excellent, prospects, for, ending, the, feud, since, he, was, a, welf, on, his, mother, s, side, the, welf, duke, of, saxony, henry, the, lion, would, not, be, appeased, however, remaining, an, implacable, enemy, of, the, hohenstaufen, monarchy, barbarossa, had, the, duchies, of, swabia, and, franconia, the, force, of, his, own, personality, and, very, little, else, to, construct, an, empire, the, germany, that, frederick, tried, to, unite, was, a, patchwork, of, more, than, 1, 600, individual, states, each, with, its, own, prince, a, few, of, these, such, as, bavaria, and, saxony, were, large, many, were, too, small, to, pinpoint, on, a, map, the, titles, afforded, to, the, german, king, were, caesar, augustus, and, emperor, of, the, romans, by, the, time, frederick, would, assume, these, they, were, little, more, than, propaganda, slogans, with, little, other, meaning, frederick, was, a, pragmatist, who, dealt, with, the, princes, by, finding, a, mutual, self, interest, unlike, henry, ii, of, england, frederick, did, not, attempt, to, end, medieval, feudalism, but, rather, tried, to, restore, it, though, this, was, beyond, his, ability, the, great, players, in, the, german, civil, war, had, been, the, pope, emperor, ghibellines, and, the, guelfs, but, none, of, these, had, emerged, as, the, winner, eager, to, restore, the, empire, to, the, position, it, had, occupied, under, charlemagne, and, otto, i, the, great, the, new, king, saw, clearly, that, the, restoration, of, order, in, germany, was, a, necessary, preliminary, to, the, enforcement, of, the, imperial, rights, in, italy, issuing, a, general, order, for, peace, he, made, lavish, concessions, to, the, nobles, abroad, frederick, intervened, in, the, danish, civil, war, between, svend, iii, and, valdemar, i, of, denmark, and, began, negotiations, with, the, eastern, roman, emperor, manuel, i, comnenus, it, was, probably, about, this, time, that, the, king, obtained, papal, assent, for, the, annulment, of, his, childless, marriage, with, adelheid, of, vohburg, on, the, grounds, of, consanguinity, his, great, great, grandfather, was, a, brother, of, adela, s, great, great, great, grandmother, making, them, fourth, cousins, once, removed, he, then, made, a, vain, attempt, to, obtain, a, bride, from, the, court, of, constantinople, on, his, accession, frederick, had, communicated, the, news, of, his, election, to, pope, eugene, iii, but, had, neglected, to, ask, for, papal, confirmation, in, march, 1153, frederick, concluded, the, treaty, of, constance, with, the, pope, wherein, he, promised, in, return, for, his, coronation, to, defend, the, papacy, to, make, no, peace, with, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, or, other, enemies, of, the, church, without, the, consent, of, eugene, and, to, help, eugene, regain, control, of, the, city, of, rome, frederick, undertook, six, expeditions, into, italy, in, the, first, beginning, in, october, 1154, his, plan, was, to, launch, a, campaign, against, the, normans, under, king, william, i, of, sicily, he, marched, down, and, almost, immediately, encountered, resistance, to, his, authority, obtaining, the, submission, of, milan, he, successfully, besieged, tortona, on, 13, february, 1155, razing, it, to, the, ground, on, 18, april, he, moved, on, to, pavia, where, he, according, to, some, historians, received, the, iron, crown, and, the, title, of, king, of, italy, on, 24, april, in, the, basilica, of, san, michele, maggiore, other, historians, instead, suggest, his, coronation, took, place, in, monza, on, 15, april, moving, through, bologna, and, tuscany, he, was, soon, approaching, the, city, of, rome, there, pope, adrian, iv, was, struggling, with, the, forces, of, the, republican, city, commune, led, by, arnold, of, brescia, a, student, of, abelard, as, a, sign, of, good, faith, frederick, dismissed, the, ambassadors, from, the, revived, roman, senate, and, imperial, forces, suppressed, the, republicans, arnold, was, captured, and, hanged, for, treason, and, rebellion, despite, his, unorthodox, teaching, concerning, theology, arnold, was, not, charged, with, heresy, as, frederick, approached, the, gates, of, rome, the, pope, advanced, to, meet, him, at, the, royal, tent, the, king, received, him, and, after, kissing, the, pope, s, feet, frederick, expected, to, receive, the, traditional, kiss, of, peace, frederick, had, declined, to, hold, the, pope, s, stirrup, while, leading, him, to, the, tent, however, so, adrian, refused, to, give, the, kiss, until, this, protocol, had, been, complied, with, frederick, hesitated, and, adrian, iv, withdrew, after, a, day, s, negotiation, frederick, agreed, to, perform, the, required, ritual, reportedly, muttering, pro, petro, non, adriano, for, peter, not, for, adrian, rome, was, still, in, an, uproar, over, the, fate, of, arnold, of, brescia, so, rather, than, marching, through, the, streets, of, rome, frederick, and, adrian, retired, to, the, vatican, the, next, day, 18, june, 1155, adrian, iv, crowned, frederick, i, holy, roman, emperor, at, st, peter, s, basilica, amidst, the, acclamations, of, the, german, army, the, romans, began, to, riot, and, frederick, spent, his, coronation, day, putting, down, the, revolt, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, over, 1, 000, romans, and, many, more, thousands, injured, the, next, day, frederick, adrian, and, the, german, army, travelled, to, tivoli, from, there, a, combination, of, the, unhealthy, italian, summer, and, the, effects, of, his, year, long, absence, from, germany, meant, he, was, forced, to, put, off, his, planned, campaign, against, the, normans, of, sicily, on, their, way, northwards, they, attacked, spoleto, and, encountered, the, ambassadors, of, manuel, i, comnenus, who, showered, frederick, with, costly, gifts, at, verona, frederick, declared, his, fury, with, the, rebellious, milanese, before, finally, returning, to, germany, disorder, was, again, rampant, in, germany, especially, in, bavaria, but, general, peace, was, restored, by, frederick, s, vigorous, but, conciliatory, measures, the, duchy, of, bavaria, was, transferred, from, henry, ii, jasomirgott, margrave, of, austria, to, frederick, s, formidable, younger, cousin, henry, the, lion, duke, of, saxony, of, the, house, of, guelph, whose, father, had, previously, held, both, duchies, henry, ii, jasomirgott, was, named, duke, of, austria, in, compensation, for, his, loss, of, bavaria, as, part, of, his, general, policy, of, concessions, of, formal, power, to, the, german, princes, and, ending, the, civil, wars, within, the, kingdom, frederick, further, appeased, henry, by, issuing, him, with, the, privilegium, minus, granting, him, unprecedented, entitlements, as, duke, of, austria, this, was, a, large, concession, on, the, part, of, frederick, who, realized, that, henry, the, lion, had, to, be, accommodated, even, to, the, point, of, sharing, some, power, with, him, frederick, could, not, afford, to, make, an, outright, enemy, of, henry, on, 9, june, 1156, at, w, rzburg, frederick, married, beatrice, of, burgundy, daughter, and, heiress, of, renaud, iii, thus, adding, to, his, possessions, the, sizeable, realm, of, the, county, of, burgundy, in, an, attempt, to, create, comity, emperor, frederick, proclaimed, the, peace, of, the, land, written, between, 1152, and, 1157, which, enacted, punishments, for, a, variety, of, crimes, as, well, as, systems, for, adjudicating, many, disputes, he, also, declared, himself, the, sole, augustus, of, the, roman, world, ceasing, to, recognise, manuel, i, at, constantinople, the, retreat, of, frederick, in, 1155, forced, pope, adrian, iv, to, come, to, terms, with, king, william, i, of, sicily, granting, to, william, i, territories, that, frederick, viewed, as, his, dominion, this, aggrieved, frederick, and, he, was, further, displeased, when, papal, legates, chose, to, interpret, a, letter, from, adrian, to, frederick, in, a, manner, that, seemed, to, imply, that, the, imperial, crown, was, a, gift, from, the, papacy, and, that, in, fact, the, empire, itself, was, a, fief, of, the, papacy, disgusted, with, the, pope, and, still, wishing, to, crush, the, normans, in, the, south, of, italy, in, june, 1158, frederick, set, out, upon, his, second, italian, expedition, accompanied, by, henry, the, lion, and, his, saxon, troops, this, expedition, resulted, in, the, revolt, and, capture, of, milan, the, diet, of, roncaglia, that, saw, the, establishment, of, imperial, officers, and, ecclesiastical, reforms, in, the, cities, of, northern, italy, and, the, beginning, of, the, long, struggle, with, pope, alexander, iii, milan, soon, rebelled, again, and, humiliated, empress, beatrice, see, legend, below, the, death, of, pope, adrian, iv, in, 1159, led, to, the, election, of, two, rival, popes, alexander, iii, and, the, antipope, victor, iv, and, both, sought, frederick, s, support, frederick, busy, with, the, siege, of, crema, appeared, unsupportive, of, alexander, iii, and, after, the, sacking, of, crema, demanded, that, alexander, appear, before, the, emperor, at, pavia, and, to, accept, the, imperial, decree, alexander, refused, and, frederick, recognised, victor, iv, as, the, legitimate, pope, in, 1160, in, response, alexander, iii, excommunicated, both, frederick, i, and, victor, iv, frederick, attempted, to, convoke, a, joint, council, with, king, louis, vii, of, france, in, 1162, to, decide, the, issue, of, who, should, be, pope, louis, neared, the, meeting, site, but, when, he, became, aware, that, frederick, had, stacked, the, votes, for, victor, louis, decided, not, to, attend, the, council, as, a, result, the, issue, was, not, resolved, at, that, time, the, political, result, of, the, struggle, with, pope, alexander, was, an, alliance, formed, between, the, norman, state, of, sicily, and, pope, alexander, iii, against, frederick, in, the, meantime, frederick, had, to, deal, with, another, rebellion, at, milan, in, which, the, city, surrendered, on, 6, march, 1162, much, of, it, was, destroyed, three, weeks, later, on, the, emperor, s, orders, the, fate, of, milan, led, to, the, submission, of, brescia, placentia, and, many, other, northern, italian, cities, in, august, 1162, he, triumphantly, entered, turin, and, was, crowned, with, his, consort, in, the, cathedral, on, august, 15, returning, to, germany, towards, the, close, of, 1162, frederick, prevented, the, escalation, of, conflicts, between, henry, the, lion, from, saxony, and, a, number, of, neighbouring, princes, who, were, growing, weary, of, henry, s, power, influence, and, territorial, gains, he, also, severely, punished, the, citizens, of, mainz, for, their, rebellion, against, archbishop, arnold, in, frederick, s, third, visit, to, italy, in, 1163, his, plans, for, the, conquest, of, sicily, were, ruined, by, the, formation, of, a, powerful, league, against, him, brought, together, mainly, by, opposition, to, imperial, taxes, in, 1164, frederick, took, what, are, believed, to, be, the, relics, of, the, biblical, magi, the, wise, men, or, three, kings, from, the, basilica, di, sant, eustorgio, in, milan, and, gave, them, as, a, gift, or, as, loot, to, the, archbishop, of, cologne, rainald, of, dassel, the, relics, had, great, religious, significance, and, could, be, counted, upon, to, draw, pilgrims, from, all, over, christendom, today, they, are, kept, in, the, shrine, of, the, three, kings, in, the, cologne, cathedral, after, the, death, of, the, antipope, victor, iv, frederick, supported, antipope, paschal, iii, but, he, was, soon, driven, from, rome, leading, to, the, return, of, pope, alexander, iii, in, 1165, in, the, meantime, frederick, was, focused, on, restoring, peace, in, the, rhineland, where, he, organized, a, magnificent, celebration, of, the, canonization, of, charlemagne, at, aachen, under, the, authority, of, the, antipope, paschal, iii, concerned, over, rumours, that, alexander, iii, was, about, to, enter, into, an, alliance, with, the, byzantine, emperor, manuel, i, in, october, 1166, frederick, embarked, on, his, fourth, italian, campaign, hoping, as, well, to, secure, the, claim, of, paschal, iii, and, the, coronation, of, his, wife, beatrice, as, holy, roman, empress, this, time, henry, the, lion, refused, to, join, frederick, on, his, italian, trip, tending, instead, to, his, own, disputes, with, neighbors, and, his, continuing, expansion, into, slavic, territories, in, northeastern, germany, in, 1167, frederick, began, besieging, ancona, which, had, acknowledged, the, authority, of, manuel, i, at, the, same, time, his, forces, achieved, a, great, victory, over, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, monte, porzio, heartened, by, this, victory, frederick, lifted, the, siege, of, ancona, and, hurried, to, rome, where, he, had, his, wife, crowned, empress, and, also, received, a, second, coronation, from, paschal, iii, his, campaign, was, halted, by, the, sudden, outbreak, of, an, epidemic, malaria, or, the, plague, which, threatened, to, destroy, the, imperial, army, and, drove, the, emperor, as, a, fugitive, to, germany, where, he, remained, for, the, ensuing, six, years, during, this, period, frederick, decided, conflicting, claims, to, various, bishoprics, asserted, imperial, authority, over, bohemia, poland, and, hungary, initiated, friendly, relations, with, manuel, i, and, tried, to, come, to, a, better, understanding, with, henry, ii, of, england, and, louis, vii, of, france, many, swabian, counts, including, his, cousin, the, young, duke, of, swabia, frederick, iv, died, in, 1167, so, he, was, able, to, organize, a, new, mighty, territory, in, the, duchy, of, swabia, under, his, reign, in, this, time, consequently, his, younger, son, frederick, v, became, the, new, duke, of, swabia, in, 1167, while, his, eldest, son, henry, was, crowned, king, of, the, romans, in, 1169, alongside, his, father, who, also, retained, the, title, increasing, anti, german, sentiment, swept, through, lombardy, culminating, in, the, restoration, of, milan, in, 1169, in, 1174, frederick, made, his, fifth, expedition, to, italy, it, was, probably, during, this, time, that, the, famous, tafelg, terverzeichnis, a, record, of, the, royal, estates, was, made, he, was, opposed, by, the, pro, papal, lombard, league, now, joined, by, venice, sicily, and, constantinople, which, had, previously, formed, to, stand, against, him, the, cities, of, northern, italy, had, become, exceedingly, wealthy, through, trade, representing, a, marked, turning, point, in, the, transition, from, medieval, feudalism, while, continental, feudalism, had, remained, strong, socially, and, economically, it, was, in, deep, political, decline, by, the, time, of, frederick, barbarossa, when, the, northern, italian, cities, inflicted, a, defeat, on, frederick, at, alessandria, in, 1175, the, european, world, was, shocked, with, the, refusal, of, henry, the, lion, to, bring, help, to, italy, the, campaign, was, a, complete, failure, frederick, suffered, a, heavy, defeat, at, the, battle, of, legnano, near, milan, on, 29, may, 1176, where, he, was, wounded, and, for, some, time, was, believed, to, be, dead, this, battle, marked, the, turning, point, in, frederick, s, claim, to, empire, he, had, no, choice, other, than, to, begin, negotiations, for, peace, with, alexander, iii, and, the, lombard, league, in, the, peace, of, anagni, in, 1176, frederick, recognized, alexander, iii, as, pope, and, in, the, peace, of, venice, in, 1177, frederick, and, alexander, iii, were, formally, reconciled, with, decisions, of, paschal, iii, nullfied, beatrice, ceased, to, be, referred, as, empress, the, scene, was, similar, to, that, which, had, occurred, between, pope, gregory, vii, and, henry, iv, holy, roman, emperor, at, canossa, a, century, earlier, the, conflict, was, the, same, as, that, resolved, in, the, concordat, of, worms, did, the, holy, roman, emperor, have, the, power, to, name, the, pope, and, bishops, the, investiture, controversy, from, previous, centuries, had, been, brought, to, a, tendentious, peace, with, the, concordat, of, worms, and, affirmed, in, the, first, council, of, the, lateran, now, it, had, recurred, in, a, slightly, different, form, frederick, had, to, humble, himself, before, alexander, iii, at, venice, the, emperor, acknowledged, the, pope, s, sovereignty, over, the, papal, states, and, in, return, alexander, acknowledged, the, emperor, s, overlordship, of, the, imperial, church, also, in, the, peace, of, venice, a, truce, was, made, with, the, lombard, cities, which, took, effect, in, august, 1178, the, grounds, for, a, permanent, peace, were, not, established, until, 1183, however, in, the, peace, of, constance, when, frederick, conceded, their, right, to, freely, elect, town, magistrates, by, this, move, frederick, recovered, his, nominal, domination, over, italy, which, became, his, chief, means, of, applying, pressure, on, the, papacy, in, a, move, to, consolidate, his, reign, after, the, disastrous, expedition, into, italy, frederick, was, formally, crowned, king, of, burgundy, at, arles, on, 30, june, 1178, although, traditionally, the, german, kings, had, automatically, inherited, the, royal, crown, of, arles, since, the, time, of, conrad, ii, frederick, felt, the, need, to, be, crowned, by, the, archbishop, of, arles, regardless, of, his, laying, claim, to, the, title, from, 1152, frederick, did, not, forgive, henry, the, lion, for, refusing, to, come, to, his, aid, in, 1176, by, 1180, henry, had, successfully, established, a, powerful, state, comprising, saxony, bavaria, and, substantial, territories, in, the, north, and, east, of, germany, taking, advantage, of, the, hostility, of, other, german, princes, to, henry, frederick, had, henry, tried, in, absentia, by, a, court, of, bishops, and, princes, in, 1180, declared, that, imperial, law, overruled, traditional, german, law, and, had, henry, stripped, of, his, lands, and, declared, an, outlaw, he, then, invaded, saxony, with, an, imperial, army, to, force, his, cousin, to, surrender, henry, s, allies, deserted, him, and, he, finally, had, to, submit, to, frederick, at, an, imperial, diet, in, erfurt, in, november, 1181, henry, spent, three, years, in, exile, at, the, court, of, his, father, in, law, henry, ii, of, england, in, normandy, before, being, allowed, back, into, germany, he, finished, his, days, in, germany, as, the, much, diminished, duke, of, brunswick, frederick, s, desire, for, revenge, was, sated, henry, the, lion, lived, a, relatively, quiet, life, sponsoring, arts, and, architecture, frederick, s, victory, over, henry, did, not, gain, him, as, much, in, the, german, feudalistic, system, as, it, would, have, in, the, english, feudalistic, system, while, in, england, the, pledge, of, fealty, went, in, a, direct, line, from, overlords, to, those, under, them, the, germans, pledged, oaths, only, to, the, direct, overlord, so, that, in, henry, s, case, those, below, him, in, the, feudal, chain, owed, nothing, to, frederick, thus, despite, the, diminished, stature, of, henry, the, lion, frederick, did, not, gain, his, allegiances, frederick, was, faced, with, the, reality, of, disorder, among, the, german, states, where, continuous, civil, wars, were, waged, between, pretenders, and, the, ambitious, who, wanted, the, crown, for, themselves, italian, unity, under, german, rule, was, more, myth, than, truth, despite, proclamations, of, german, hegemony, the, pope, was, the, most, powerful, force, in, italy, when, frederick, returned, to, germany, after, his, defeat, in, northern, italy, he, was, a, bitter, and, exhausted, man, the, german, princes, far, from, being, subordinated, to, royal, control, were, intensifying, their, hold, on, wealth, and, power, in, germany, and, entrenching, their, positions, there, began, to, be, a, generalized, social, desire, to, create, greater, germany, by, conquering, the, slavs, to, the, east, although, the, italian, city, states, had, achieved, a, measure, of, independence, from, frederick, as, a, result, of, his, failed, fifth, expedition, into, italy, the, emperor, had, not, given, up, on, his, italian, dominions, in, 1184, he, held, a, massive, celebration, the, diet, of, pentecost, when, his, two, eldest, sons, were, knighted, and, thousands, of, knights, were, invited, from, all, over, germany, while, payments, upon, the, knighting, of, a, son, were, part, of, the, expectations, of, an, overlord, in, england, and, france, only, a, gift, was, given, in, germany, for, such, an, occasion, frederick, s, monetary, gain, from, this, celebration, is, said, to, have, been, modest, later, in, 1184, frederick, again, moved, into, italy, this, time, joining, forces, with, the, local, rural, nobility, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, tuscan, cities, in, 1186, he, engineered, the, marriage, of, his, son, henry, to, constance, of, sicily, heiress, to, the, kingdom, of, sicily, over, the, objections, of, pope, urban, iii, pope, urban, iii, died, shortly, after, and, was, succeeded, by, pope, gregory, viii, who, even, as, papal, chancellor, had, pursued, a, more, conciliatory, line, with, the, emperor, than, previous, popes, and, was, more, concerned, with, troubling, reports, from, the, holy, land, than, with, a, power, struggle, with, barbarossa, around, 23, november, 1187, frederick, received, letters, that, had, been, sent, to, him, from, the, rulers, of, the, crusader, states, in, the, near, east, urging, him, to, come, to, their, aid, around, 1, december, cardinal, henry, of, marcy, preached, a, crusade, sermon, before, frederick, and, a, public, assembly, in, strasbourg, frederick, expressed, support, for, the, crusade, but, declined, to, take, the, cross, on, the, grounds, of, his, ongoing, conflict, with, archbishop, philip, of, cologne, he, did, however, urge, king, philip, ii, of, france, to, take, the, cross, through, messengers, and, then, in, a, personal, meeting, on, 25, december, on, the, border, between, ivois, and, mouzon, on, 27, march, 1188, at, the, diet, of, mainz, the, archbishop, of, cologne, submitted, to, frederick, bishop, of, w, rzburg, godfrey, of, spitzenberg, preached, a, crusade, sermon, and, frederick, asked, the, assembly, whether, he, should, take, the, cross, at, the, universal, acclaim, of, the, assembly, he, took, the, crusader, s, vow, his, second, son, the, duke, of, swabia, followed, suit, the, eldest, henry, vi, was, to, remain, behind, in, germany, as, regent, at, mainz, frederick, proclaimed, a, general, expedition, against, the, pagans, he, set, the, period, of, preparation, as, 17, april, 1188, to, 8, april, 1189, and, scheduled, the, army, to, assemble, at, regensburg, on, 23, april, 1189, at, strasbourg, frederick, had, imposed, a, small, tax, on, the, jews, of, germany, to, fund, the, crusade, he, also, put, the, jews, under, his, protection, and, forbade, anyone, to, preach, against, the, jews, when, mobs, threatened, the, jews, of, mainz, on, the, eve, of, the, assembly, in, march, frederick, sent, the, imperial, marshal, henry, of, kalden, to, disperse, them, rabbi, moses, then, met, with, the, emperor, which, resulted, in, an, imperial, edict, threatening, maiming, or, death, for, anyone, who, maimed, or, killed, a, jew, on, 29, march, frederick, and, the, rabbi, rode, through, the, streets, together, frederick, successfully, prevented, a, repeat, of, the, massacres, that, had, accompanied, the, first, crusade, and, second, crusade, in, germany, because, frederick, had, signed, a, treaty, of, friendship, with, saladin, in, 1175, he, felt, it, necessary, to, give, saladin, notice, of, the, termination, of, their, alliance, on, 26, may, 1188, he, sent, count, henry, ii, of, dietz, to, present, an, ultimatum, to, saladin, a, few, days, after, christmas, 1188, frederick, received, hungarian, byzantine, serbian, and, seljuk, envoys, in, nuremberg, the, hungarians, and, seljuks, promised, provisions, and, safe, conduct, to, the, crusaders, the, envoys, of, stefan, nemanja, grand, prince, of, serbia, announced, that, their, prince, would, receive, frederick, in, ni, only, with, difficulty, was, an, agreement, reached, with, the, byzantine, envoy, john, kamateros, frederick, sent, a, large, embassy, ahead, to, make, preparations, in, byzantium, on, 15, april, 1189, in, haguenau, frederick, formally, and, symbolically, accepted, the, staff, and, scrip, of, a, pilgrim, and, set, out, his, crusade, was, the, most, meticulously, planned, and, organized, up, to, that, time, according, to, one, source, written, in, the, 1220s, frederick, organized, a, grand, army, of, 100, 000, men, including, 20, 000, knights, and, set, out, on, the, overland, route, to, the, holy, land, this, number, is, believed, to, be, inaccurate, by, modern, scholars, using, incomplete, contemporary, sources, that, place, the, size, of, his, army, at, 12, 000, 15, 000, men, including, 3, 000, 4, 000, knights, on, 11, may, 1189, after, the, majority, of, his, army, had, already, departed, toward, hungary, on, land, frederick, sailed, from, regensburg, down, the, river, danube, when, he, came, to, the, village, of, mauthausen, frederick, ordered, the, village, to, be, burned, for, levying, a, toll, on, the, crusader, army, the, crusaders, then, passed, through, hungary, serbia, and, bulgaria, before, entering, byzantine, territory, while, in, hungary, barbarossa, personally, asked, the, hungarian, prince, g, za, brother, of, king, b, la, iii, of, hungary, to, join, the, crusade, the, king, agreed, and, a, hungarian, army, of, 2, 000, men, led, by, g, za, escorted, the, german, emperor, s, forces, later, on, frederick, camped, in, philippopolis, then, in, adrianople, in, the, autumn, of, 1189, to, avoid, the, winter, climate, in, anatolia, in, the, meantime, he, received, imprisoned, german, emissaries, who, were, held, in, constantinople, and, exchanged, hostages, with, isaac, ii, as, a, guarantee, that, the, crusaders, would, not, sack, local, settlements, until, they, depart, the, byzantine, territory, in, march, 1190, frederick, left, adrianople, for, gallipoli, at, the, dardanelles, to, embark, to, asia, minor, the, armies, coming, from, western, europe, pushed, on, through, anatolia, where, they, were, victorious, at, the, battle, of, philomelium, and, defeated, the, turks, in, the, battle, of, iconium, eventually, reaching, as, far, as, cilician, armenia, the, approach, of, barbarossa, s, victorious, german, army, greatly, concerned, saladin, who, was, forced, to, weaken, his, force, at, the, siege, of, acre, and, send, troops, to, the, north, to, block, the, arrival, of, the, germans, barbarossa, opted, on, the, local, armenians, advice, to, follow, a, shortcut, along, the, saleph, river, meanwhile, the, army, started, to, traverse, the, mountain, path, on, 10, june, 1190, he, drowned, near, silifke, castle, in, the, saleph, river, there, are, several, conflicting, accounts, of, the, event, jacques, de, vitry, a, historian, of, the, crusades, outlined, frederick, s, endeavors, and, saladin, s, dilemma, in, which, he, reported, while, these, were, the, varied, fortunes, of, the, first, in, the, field, frederick, the, roman, emperor, set, out, on, his, journey, by, land, with, great, power, and, a, countless, host, of, warriors, passing, over, the, borders, of, germany, he, crossed, hungary, macedonia, and, greece, and, marched, through, the, land, of, the, saracens, with, a, mighty, hand, and, a, stretched, out, arm, he, took, iconium, philomena, and, many, other, cities, and, reached, armenia, where, during, great, heat, he, went, into, the, river, which, the, natives, call, the, iron, river, to, bathe, and, therein, for, our, sins, was, miserably, drowned, and, so, died, to, the, loss, of, all, christendom, saladin, so, greatly, feared, his, approach, that, he, ordered, the, walls, of, laodicia, gibelet, tortosa, biblium, and, beyrout, to, be, pulled, down, sparing, only, the, fortresses, that, is, the, citadels, and, towers, frederick, s, death, caused, several, thousand, german, soldiers, to, leave, the, force, and, return, home, through, the, cilician, and, syrian, ports, the, german, hungarian, army, was, struck, with, an, onset, of, disease, near, antioch, weakening, it, further, only, 5, 000, soldiers, a, third, of, the, original, force, arrived, in, acre, barbarossa, s, son, frederick, vi, of, swabia, carried, on, with, the, remnants, of, the, german, army, along, with, the, hungarian, army, under, the, command, of, prince, g, za, with, the, aim, of, burying, the, emperor, in, jerusalem, but, efforts, to, preserve, his, body, in, vinegar, failed, hence, his, flesh, was, interred, in, the, cathedral, of, saint, peter, in, antioch, his, bones, in, the, cathedral, of, tyre, and, his, heart, and, inner, organs, in, saint, paul, s, church, tarsus, the, unexpected, demise, of, frederick, left, the, crusader, army, under, the, command, of, the, rivals, philip, ii, and, richard, who, had, traveled, to, palestine, separately, by, sea, and, ultimately, led, to, its, dissolution, richard, continued, to, the, east, where, he, fought, saladin, winning, territories, along, the, shores, of, palestine, but, ultimately, failed, to, win, the, war, by, conquering, jerusalem, itself, before, he, was, forced, to, return, to, his, own, territories, in, north, western, europe, known, to, modern, historians, as, the, angevin, empire, he, returned, home, after, he, signed, the, treaty, of, ramla, agreeing, that, jerusalem, would, remain, under, muslim, control, while, allowing, unarmed, christian, pilgrims, and, traders, to, visit, the, city, the, treaty, also, reduced, the, latin, kingdom, to, a, geopolitical, coastal, strip, extending, from, tyre, to, jaffa, the, increase, in, wealth, of, the, trading, cities, of, northern, italy, led, to, a, revival, in, the, study, of, the, justinian, code, a, latin, legal, system, that, had, become, extinct, centuries, earlier, legal, scholars, renewed, its, application, it, is, speculated, that, pope, gregory, vii, personally, encouraged, the, justinian, rule, of, law, and, had, a, copy, of, it, the, historian, norman, cantor, described, corpus, juris, civilis, justinian, body, of, civil, law, as, the, greatest, legal, code, ever, devised, it, envisaged, the, law, of, the, state, as, a, reflection, of, natural, moral, law, the, principle, of, rationality, in, the, universe, by, the, time, frederick, assumed, the, throne, this, legal, system, was, well, established, on, both, sides, of, the, alps, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, availability, of, the, new, professional, class, of, lawyers, the, civil, law, allowed, frederick, to, use, these, lawyers, to, administer, his, kingdom, in, a, logical, and, consistent, manner, it, also, provided, a, framework, to, legitimize, his, claim, to, the, right, to, rule, both, germany, and, northern, italy, in, the, old, days, of, henry, iv, and, henry, v, the, claim, of, divine, right, of, kings, had, been, severely, undermined, by, the, investiture, controversy, the, church, had, won, that, argument, in, the, common, man, s, mind, there, was, no, divine, right, for, the, german, king, to, also, control, the, church, by, naming, both, bishops, and, popes, the, institution, of, the, justinian, code, was, used, perhaps, unscrupulously, by, frederick, to, lay, claim, to, divine, powers, in, germany, frederick, was, a, political, realist, taking, what, he, could, and, leaving, the, rest, in, italy, he, tended, to, be, a, romantic, reactionary, reveling, in, the, antiquarian, spirit, of, the, age, exemplified, by, a, revival, of, classical, studies, and, roman, law, it, was, through, the, use, of, the, restored, justinian, code, that, frederick, came, to, view, himself, as, a, new, roman, emperor, roman, law, gave, a, rational, purpose, for, the, existence, of, frederick, and, his, imperial, ambitions, it, was, a, counterweight, to, the, claims, of, the, church, to, have, authority, because, of, divine, revelation, the, church, was, opposed, to, frederick, for, ideological, reasons, not, the, least, of, which, was, the, humanist, nature, found, in, the, revival, of, the, old, roman, legal, system, when, pepin, the, short, sought, to, become, king, of, the, franks, in, the, 8th, century, the, church, needed, military, protection, so, pepin, found, it, convenient, to, make, an, ally, of, the, pope, frederick, however, desired, to, put, the, pope, aside, and, claim, the, crown, of, old, rome, simply, because, he, was, in, the, likeness, of, the, great, emperors, of, old, who, tended, to, have, a, domineering, role, over, the, church, caesaropapism, pope, adrian, iv, was, naturally, opposed, to, this, view, and, undertook, a, vigorous, propaganda, campaign, designed, to, diminish, frederick, and, his, ambition, to, a, large, extent, this, was, successful, frederick, did, little, to, encourage, economic, development, in, germany, prior, to, the, autumn, of, 1165, in, that, year, he, visited, the, lower, rhineland, the, most, economically, advanced, region, in, germany, he, had, already, travelled, to, northern, italy, the, most, economically, advanced, region, in, the, empire, three, times, from, 1165, on, frederick, pursued, economic, policies, to, encourage, growth, and, trade, there, is, no, question, that, his, reign, was, a, period, of, major, economic, growth, in, germany, but, it, is, impossible, now, to, determine, how, much, of, that, growth, was, owed, to, frederick, s, policies, the, number, of, mints, in, germany, increased, ninefold, in, the, reign, of, frederick, and, his, son, henry, from, about, two, dozen, mints, at, the, start, of, his, reign, to, 215, mints, in, 1197, and, from, a, mere, two, royal, mints, to, 28, frederick, himself, established, at, least, twelve, royal, mints, including, those, of, aachen, donauw, rth, ulm, haguenau, duisburg, kaiserswerth, frankfurt, gelnhausen, and, dortmund, he, also, granted, privileges, exempting, the, merchants, of, aachen, gelnhausen, haguenau, monza, rome, pisa, and, venice, from, all, tolls, within, the, empire, otto, of, freising, frederick, s, uncle, wrote, an, account, of, his, reign, entitled, gesta, friderici, i, imperatoris, deeds, of, the, emperor, frederick, which, is, considered, to, be, an, accurate, history, of, the, king, otto, s, other, major, work, the, chronica, sive, historia, de, duabus, civitatibus, chronicle, or, history, of, the, two, cities, had, been, an, exposition, of, the, civitas, dei, the, city, of, god, of, augustine, of, hippo, full, of, augustinian, negativity, concerning, the, nature, of, the, world, and, history, his, work, on, frederick, is, of, opposite, tone, being, an, optimistic, portrayal, of, the, glorious, potentials, of, imperial, authority, otto, died, after, finishing, the, first, two, books, leaving, the, last, two, to, rahewin, his, provost, rahewin, s, text, is, in, places, heavily, dependent, on, classical, precedent, for, example, rahewin, s, physical, description, of, frederick, reproduces, word, for, word, except, for, details, of, hair, and, beard, a, description, of, another, monarch, theodoric, ii, written, nearly, eight, hundred, years, earlier, by, sidonius, apollinaris, his, character, is, such, that, not, even, those, envious, of, his, power, can, belittle, its, praise, his, person, is, well, proportioned, he, is, shorter, than, very, tall, men, but, taller, and, more, noble, than, men, of, medium, height, his, hair, is, golden, curling, a, little, above, his, forehead, his, eyes, are, sharp, and, piercing, his, beard, reddish, his, lips, delicate, his, whole, face, is, bright, and, cheerful, his, teeth, are, even, and, snow, white, in, color, modesty, rather, than, anger, causes, him, to, blush, frequently, his, shoulders, are, rather, broad, and, he, is, strongly, built, in, the, opinion, of, norman, cantor, frederick, s, charisma, led, to, a, fantastic, juggling, act, that, over, a, quarter, of, a, century, restored, the, imperial, authority, in, the, german, states, his, formidable, enemies, defeated, him, on, almost, every, side, yet, in, the, end, he, emerged, triumphant, when, frederick, came, to, the, throne, the, prospects, for, the, revival, of, german, imperial, power, were, extremely, thin, the, great, german, princes, had, increased, their, power, and, land, holdings, the, king, had, been, left, with, only, the, traditional, family, domains, and, a, vestige, of, power, over, the, bishops, and, abbeys, the, backwash, of, the, investiture, controversy, had, left, the, german, states, in, continuous, turmoil, rival, states, were, in, perpetual, war, these, conditions, allowed, frederick, to, be, both, warrior, and, occasional, peace, maker, both, to, his, advantage, frederick, is, the, subject, of, many, legends, including, that, of, a, kyffh, user, legend, legend, says, he, is, not, dead, but, asleep, with, his, knights, in, a, cave, in, the, kyffh, user, mountains, in, thuringia, or, mount, untersberg, at, the, border, between, bavaria, germany, and, salzburg, austria, and, that, when, the, ravens, cease, to, fly, around, the, mountain, he, will, awake, and, restore, germany, to, its, ancient, greatness, according, to, the, story, his, red, beard, has, grown, through, the, table, at, which, he, sits, his, eyes, are, half, closed, in, sleep, but, now, and, then, he, raises, his, hand, and, sends, a, boy, out, to, see, if, the, ravens, have, stopped, flying, a, similar, story, set, in, sicily, was, earlier, attested, about, his, grandson, frederick, ii, to, garner, political, support, the, german, empire, built, atop, the, kyffh, user, the, kyffh, user, monument, which, declared, kaiser,

jacopo, da, voragine, this, was, a, popularized, interpretation, of, the, biblical, end, of, the, world, it, consisted, of, three, things, 1, terrible, natural, disasters, 2, the, arrival, of, the,
