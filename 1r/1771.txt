james, watt, frs, frse, w, t, 30, january, 1736, 19, january, 1736, os, 25, august, 1819, was, a, scottish, inventor, mechanical, engineer, and, chemist, who, improved, on, thomas, newcomen, s, 1712, newcomen, steam, engine, with, his, watt, steam, engine, in, 1776, which, was, fundamental, to, the, changes, brought, by, the, industrial, revolution, in, both, his, native, great, britain, and, the, rest, of, the, world, while, working, as, an, instrument, maker, at, the, university, of, glasgow, watt, became, interested, in, the, technology, of, steam, engines, at, the, time, engineers, such, as, john, smeaton, were, aware, of, the, inefficiencies, of, newcomen, s, engine, and, aimed, to, improve, it, watt, s, insight, was, to, realize, that, contemporary, engine, designs, wasted, a, great, deal, of, energy, by, repeatedly, cooling, and, reheating, the, cylinder, watt, introduced, a, design, enhancement, the, separate, condenser, which, avoided, this, waste, of, energy, and, radically, improved, the, power, efficiency, and, cost, effectiveness, of, steam, engines, eventually, he, adapted, his, engine, to, produce, rotary, motion, greatly, broadening, its, use, beyond, pumping, water, watt, attempted, to, commercialise, his, invention, but, experienced, great, financial, difficulties, until, he, entered, a, partnership, with, matthew, boulton, in, 1775, the, new, firm, of, boulton, and, watt, was, eventually, highly, successful, and, watt, became, a, wealthy, man, in, his, retirement, watt, continued, to, develop, new, inventions, though, none, was, as, significant, as, his, steam, engine, work, as, watt, developed, the, concept, of, horsepower, the, si, unit, of, power, the, watt, was, named, after, him, james, watt, was, born, on, 19, january, 1736, in, greenock, renfrewshire, the, eldest, of, the, five, surviving, children, of, agnes, muirhead, 1703, 1755, and, james, watt, 1698, 1782, his, mother, came, from, a, distinguished, family, was, well, educated, and, said, to, be, of, forceful, character, while, his, father, was, a, shipwright, ship, owner, and, contractor, and, served, as, the, greenock, s, chief, baillie, in, 1751, the, watt, family, s, wealth, came, in, part, from, watt, s, father, s, trading, in, slaves, and, slave, produced, goods, watt, s, parents, were, presbyterians, and, strong, covenanters, but, despite, his, religious, upbringing, he, later, became, a, deist, watt, s, grandfather, thomas, watt, 1642, 1734, was, a, teacher, of, mathematics, surveying, and, navigation, and, baillie, to, the, baron, of, cartsburn, initially, watt, was, educated, at, home, by, his, mother, later, going, on, to, attend, greenock, grammar, school, there, he, exhibited, an, aptitude, for, mathematics, while, latin, and, greek, failed, to, interest, him, watt, is, said, to, have, suffered, prolonged, bouts, of, ill, health, as, a, child, and, from, frequent, headaches, all, his, life, after, leaving, school, watt, worked, in, the, workshops, of, his, father, s, businesses, demonstrating, considerable, dexterity, and, skill, in, creating, engineering, models, after, his, father, suffered, unsuccessful, business, ventures, watt, left, greenock, to, seek, employment, in, glasgow, as, a, mathematical, instrument, maker, when, he, was, 18, watt, s, mother, died, and, his, father, s, health, began, to, fail, watt, travelled, to, london, and, was, able, to, obtain, a, period, of, training, as, an, instrument, maker, for, a, year, 1755, 56, then, returned, to, scotland, settling, in, the, major, commercial, city, of, glasgow, intent, on, setting, up, his, own, instrument, making, business, he, was, still, very, young, and, having, not, had, a, full, apprenticeship, did, not, have, the, usual, connections, via, a, former, master, to, establish, himself, as, a, journeyman, instrument, maker, watt, was, saved, from, this, impasse, by, the, arrival, from, jamaica, of, astronomical, instruments, bequeathed, by, alexander, macfarlane, to, the, university, of, glasgow, instruments, that, required, expert, attention, watt, restored, them, to, working, order, and, was, remunerated, these, instruments, were, eventually, installed, in, the, macfarlane, observatory, subsequently, three, professors, offered, him, the, opportunity, to, set, up, a, small, workshop, within, the, university, it, was, initiated, in, 1757, and, two, of, the, professors, the, physicist, and, chemist, joseph, black, as, well, as, the, famed, economist, adam, smith, became, watt, s, friends, at, first, he, worked, on, maintaining, and, repairing, scientific, instruments, used, in, the, university, helping, with, demonstrations, and, expanding, the, production, of, quadrants, he, made, and, repaired, brass, reflecting, quadrants, parallel, rulers, scales, parts, for, telescopes, and, barometers, among, other, things, biographers, such, as, samuel, smiles, assert, that, watt, struggled, to, establish, himself, in, glasgow, due, to, opposition, from, the, trades, house, but, this, has, been, disputed, by, other, historians, such, as, harry, lumsden, the, records, from, this, period, are, fragmentary, but, while, it, is, clear, that, watt, encountered, opposition, he, was, nevertheless, able, to, work, and, trade, as, a, skilled, metal, worker, suggesting, that, the, incorporation, of, hammermen, were, satisfied, that, he, met, their, requirements, for, membership, or, that, watt, managed, to, avoid, their, outright, opposition, in, 1759, he, formed, a, partnership, with, john, craig, an, architect, and, businessman, to, manufacture, and, sell, a, line, of, products, including, musical, instruments, and, toys, this, partnership, lasted, for, the, next, six, years, and, employed, up, to, 16, workers, craig, died, in, 1765, one, employee, alex, gardner, eventually, took, over, the, business, which, lasted, into, the, 20th, century, in, 1764, watt, married, his, cousin, margaret, peggy, miller, with, whom, he, had, 5, children, 2, of, whom, lived, to, adulthood, james, jr, 1769, 1848, and, margaret, 1767, 1796, his, wife, died, in, childbirth, in, 1773, in, 1777, he, married, again, to, ann, macgregor, daughter, of, a, glasgow, dye, maker, with, whom, he, had, 2, children, gregory, 1777, 1804, who, became, a, geologist, and, mineralogist, and, janet, 1779, 1794, ann, died, in, 1832, between, 1777, and, 1790, he, lived, in, regent, place, birmingham, there, is, a, popular, story, that, watt, was, inspired, to, invent, the, steam, engine, by, seeing, a, kettle, boiling, the, steam, forcing, the, lid, to, rise, and, thus, showing, watt, the, power, of, steam, this, story, is, told, in, many, forms, in, some, watt, is, a, young, lad, in, others, he, is, older, sometimes, it, s, his, mother, s, kettle, sometimes, his, aunt, s, suggesting, that, it, may, be, apocryphal, in, any, event, watt, did, not, invent, the, steam, engine, but, significantly, improved, the, efficiency, of, the, existing, newcomen, engine, by, adding, a, separate, condenser, consistent, with, the, now, familiar, principles, of, thermal, efficiency, the, story, was, possibly, created, by, watt, s, son, james, watt, jr, who, was, determined, to, preserve, and, embellish, his, father, s, legacy, in, this, light, it, can, be, seen, as, akin, to, the, story, of, isaac, newton, and, the, falling, apple, and, his, discovery, of, gravity, although, likely, a, myth, the, story, of, watt, and, the, kettle, has, a, basis, in, fact, in, trying, to, understand, the, thermodynamics, of, heat, and, steam, james, watt, carried, out, many, laboratory, experiments, and, his, diaries, record, that, in, conducting, these, he, used, a, kettle, as, a, boiler, to, generate, steam, in, 1759, watt, s, friend, john, robison, called, his, attention, to, the, use, of, steam, as, a, source, of, motive, power, the, design, of, the, newcomen, engine, in, use, for, almost, 50, years, for, pumping, water, from, mines, had, hardly, changed, from, its, first, implementation, watt, began, to, experiment, with, steam, though, he, had, never, seen, an, operating, steam, engine, he, tried, constructing, a, model, it, failed, to, work, satisfactorily, but, he, continued, his, experiments, and, began, to, read, everything, he, could, about, the, subject, he, came, to, realise, the, importance, of, latent, heat, the, thermal, energy, released, or, absorbed, during, a, constant, temperature, process, in, understanding, the, engine, which, unknown, to, watt, his, friend, joseph, black, had, previously, discovered, years, before, understanding, of, the, steam, engine, was, in, a, very, primitive, state, for, the, science, of, thermodynamics, would, not, be, formalised, for, nearly, another, 100, years, in, 1763, watt, was, asked, to, repair, a, model, newcomen, engine, belonging, to, the, university, even, after, repair, the, engine, barely, worked, after, much, experimentation, watt, demonstrated, that, about, three, quarters, of, the, thermal, energy, of, the, steam, was, being, consumed, in, heating, the, engine, cylinder, on, every, cycle, this, energy, was, wasted, because, later, in, the, cycle, cold, water, was, injected, into, the, cylinder, to, condense, the, steam, to, reduce, its, pressure, thus, by, repeatedly, heating, and, cooling, the, cylinder, the, engine, wasted, most, of, its, thermal, energy, rather, than, converting, it, into, mechanical, energy, watt, s, critical, insight, arrived, at, in, may, 1765, as, he, crossed, glasgow, green, park, was, to, cause, the, steam, to, condense, in, a, separate, chamber, apart, from, the, piston, and, to, maintain, the, temperature, of, the, cylinder, at, the, same, temperature, as, the, injected, steam, by, surrounding, it, with, a, steam, jacket, thus, very, little, energy, was, absorbed, by, the, cylinder, on, each, cycle, making, more, available, to, perform, useful, work, watt, had, a, working, model, later, that, same, year, despite, a, potentially, workable, design, there, were, still, substantial, difficulties, in, constructing, a, full, scale, engine, this, required, more, capital, some, of, which, came, from, black, more, substantial, backing, came, from, john, roebuck, the, founder, of, the, celebrated, carron, iron, works, near, falkirk, with, whom, he, now, formed, a, partnership, roebuck, lived, at, kinneil, house, in, bo, ness, during, which, time, watt, worked, at, perfecting, his, steam, engine, in, a, cottage, adjacent, to, the, house, the, shell, of, the, cottage, and, a, very, large, part, of, one, of, his, projects, still, exist, to, the, rear, the, principal, difficulty, was, in, machining, the, piston, and, cylinder, iron, workers, of, the, day, were, more, like, blacksmiths, than, modern, machinists, and, were, unable, to, produce, the, components, with, sufficient, precision, much, capital, was, spent, in, pursuing, a, patent, on, watt, s, invention, strapped, for, resources, watt, was, forced, to, take, up, employment, first, as, a, surveyor, then, as, a, civil, engineer, for, 8, years, roebuck, went, bankrupt, and, matthew, boulton, who, owned, the, soho, manufactory, works, near, birmingham, acquired, his, patent, rights, an, extension, of, the, patent, to, 1800, was, successfully, obtained, in, 1775, through, boulton, watt, finally, had, access, to, some, of, the, best, iron, workers, in, the, world, the, difficulty, of, the, manufacture, of, a, large, cylinder, with, a, tightly, fitting, piston, was, solved, by, john, wilkinson, who, had, developed, precision, boring, techniques, for, cannon, making, at, bersham, near, wrexham, north, wales, watt, and, boulton, formed, a, hugely, successful, partnership, boulton, and, watt, which, lasted, for, the, next, 25, years, in, 1776, the, first, engines, were, installed, and, working, in, commercial, enterprises, these, first, engines, were, used, to, power, pumps, and, produced, only, reciprocating, motion, to, move, the, pump, rods, at, the, bottom, of, the, shaft, the, design, was, commercially, successful, and, for, the, next, five, years, watt, was, very, busy, installing, more, engines, mostly, in, cornwall, for, pumping, water, out, of, mines, these, early, engines, were, not, manufactured, by, boulton, and, watt, but, were, made, by, others, according, to, drawings, made, by, watt, who, served, in, the, role, of, consulting, engineer, the, erection, of, the, engine, and, its, shakedown, was, supervised, by, watt, at, first, and, then, by, men, in, the, firm, s, employ, with, the, actual, work, being, accomplished, by, the, purchaser, of, the, engine, supervising, erectors, included, at, various, times, william, murdoch, john, rennie, william, playfair, john, southern, logan, henderson, james, lawson, william, brunton, isaac, perrins, and, others, these, were, large, machines, the, first, for, example, had, a, cylinder, with, a, diameter, of, 50, inches, and, an, overall, height, of, about, 24, feet, and, required, the, construction, of, a, dedicated, building, to, house, it, boulton, and, watt, charged, an, annual, payment, equal, to, one, third, of, the, value, of, the, coal, saved, in, comparison, to, a, newcomen, engine, performing, the, same, work, the, field, of, application, for, the, invention, was, greatly, widened, when, boulton, urged, watt, to, convert, the, reciprocating, motion, of, the, piston, to, produce, rotational, power, for, grinding, weaving, and, milling, although, a, crank, seemed, the, obvious, solution, to, the, conversion, watt, and, boulton, were, stymied, by, a, patent, for, this, whose, holder, james, pickard, and, his, associates, proposed, to, cross, license, the, external, condenser, watt, adamantly, opposed, this, and, they, circumvented, the, patent, by, their, sun, and, planet, gear, in, 1781, over, the, next, six, years, he, made, other, improvements, and, modifications, to, the, steam, engine, a, double, acting, engine, in, which, the, steam, acted, alternately, on, both, sides, of, the, piston, was, one, he, described, methods, for, working, the, steam, expansively, i, e, using, steam, at, pressures, well, above, atmospheric, a, compound, engine, which, connected, two, or, more, engines, was, described, two, more, patents, were, granted, for, these, in, 1781, and, 1782, numerous, other, improvements, that, made, for, easier, manufacture, and, installation, were, continually, implemented, one, of, these, included, the, use, of, the, steam, indicator, which, produced, an, informative, plot, of, the, pressure, in, the, cylinder, against, its, volume, which, he, kept, as, a, trade, secret, another, important, invention, one, which, watt, was, most, proud, of, was, the, parallel, motion, linkage, which, was, essential, in, double, acting, engines, as, it, produced, the, straight, line, motion, required, for, the, cylinder, rod, and, pump, from, the, connected, rocking, beam, whose, end, moves, in, a, circular, arc, this, was, patented, in, 1784, a, throttle, valve, to, control, the, power, of, the, engine, and, a, centrifugal, governor, patented, in, 1788, to, keep, it, from, running, away, were, very, important, these, improvements, taken, together, produced, an, engine, which, was, up, to, five, times, as, fuel, efficient, as, the, newcomen, engine, because, of, the, danger, of, exploding, boilers, which, were, in, a, very, primitive, stage, of, development, and, the, ongoing, issues, with, leaks, watt, restricted, his, use, of, high, pressure, steam, all, of, his, engines, used, steam, at, near, atmospheric, pressure, edward, bull, started, constructing, engines, for, boulton, and, watt, in, cornwall, in, 1781, by, 1792, he, had, started, making, engines, of, his, own, design, but, which, contained, a, separate, condenser, and, so, infringed, watt, s, patents, two, brothers, jabez, carter, hornblower, and, jonathan, hornblower, jnr, also, started, to, build, engines, about, the, same, time, others, began, to, modify, newcomen, engines, by, adding, a, condenser, and, the, mine, owners, in, cornwall, became, convinced, that, watt, s, patent, could, not, be, enforced, they, started, to, withhold, payments, to, boulton, and, watt, which, by, 1795, had, fallen, on, hard, times, of, the, total, 21, 000, equivalent, to, 2, 740, 000, as, of, 2023, owed, only, 2, 500, had, been, received, watt, was, forced, to, go, to, court, to, enforce, his, claims, he, first, sued, bull, in, 1793, the, jury, found, for, watt, but, the, question, of, whether, or, not, the, original, specification, of, the, patent, was, valid, was, left, to, another, trial, in, the, meantime, injunctions, were, issued, against, the, infringers, forcing, their, payments, of, the, royalties, to, be, placed, in, escrow, the, trial, on, determining, the, validity, of, the, specifications, which, was, held, in, the, following, year, was, inconclusive, but, the, injunctions, remained, in, force, and, the, infringers, except, for, jonathan, hornblower, all, began, to, settle, their, cases, hornblower, was, soon, brought, to, trial, in, 1799, and, the, verdict, of, the, four, was, decisively, in, favour, of, watt, their, friend, john, wilkinson, who, had, solved, the, problem, of, boring, an, accurate, cylinder, was, a, particularly, grievous, case, he, had, erected, about, 20, engines, without, boulton, s, and, watts, knowledge, they, finally, agreed, to, settle, the, infringement, in, 1796, boulton, and, watt, never, collected, all, that, was, owed, them, but, the, disputes, were, all, settled, directly, between, the, parties, or, through, arbitration, these, trials, were, extremely, costly, in, both, money, and, time, but, ultimately, were, successful, for, the, firm, before, 1780, there, was, no, good, method, for, making, copies, of, letters, or, drawings, the, only, method, sometimes, used, was, a, mechanical, one, using, multiple, linked, pens, watt, at, first, experimented, with, improving, this, method, but, soon, gave, up, on, this, approach, because, it, was, so, cumbersome, he, instead, decided, to, try, to, physically, transfer, ink, from, the, front, of, the, original, to, the, back, of, another, sheet, moistened, with, a, solvent, and, pressed, to, the, original, the, second, sheet, had, to, be, thin, so, that, the, ink, could, be, seen, through, it, when, the, copy, was, held, up, to, the, light, thus, reproducing, the, original, exactly, watt, started, to, develop, the, process, in, 1779, and, made, many, experiments, to, formulate, the, ink, select, the, thin, paper, to, devise, a, method, for, wetting, the, special, thin, paper, and, to, make, a, press, suitable, for, applying, the, correct, pressure, to, effect, the, transfer, all, of, these, required, much, experimentation, but, he, soon, had, enough, success, to, patent, the, process, a, year, later, watt, formed, another, partnership, with, boulton, who, provided, financing, and, james, keir, to, manage, the, business, in, a, firm, called, james, watt, and, co, the, perfection, of, the, invention, required, much, more, development, work, before, it, could, be, routinely, used, by, others, but, this, was, carried, out, over, the, next, few, years, boulton, and, watt, gave, up, their, shares, to, their, sons, in, 1794, it, became, a, commercial, success, and, was, widely, used, in, offices, even, into, the, 20th, century, from, an, early, age, watt, was, very, interested, in, chemistry, in, late, 1786, while, in, paris, he, witnessed, an, experiment, by, claude, louis, berthollet, in, which, he, reacted, hydrochloric, acid, with, manganese, dioxide, to, produce, chlorine, he, had, already, found, that, an, aqueous, solution, of, chlorine, could, bleach, textiles, and, had, published, his, findings, which, aroused, great, interest, among, many, potential, rivals, when, watt, returned, to, britain, he, began, experiments, along, these, lines, with, hopes, of, finding, a, commercially, viable, process, he, discovered, that, a, mixture, of, salt, manganese, dioxide, and, sulphuric, acid, could, produce, chlorine, which, watt, believed, might, be, a, cheaper, method, he, passed, the, chlorine, into, a, weak, solution, of, alkali, and, obtained, a, turbid, solution, that, appeared, to, have, good, bleaching, properties, he, soon, communicated, these, results, to, james, mcgrigor, his, father, in, law, who, was, a, bleacher, in, glasgow, otherwise, he, tried, to, keep, his, method, a, secret, with, mcgrigor, and, his, wife, annie, he, started, to, scale, up, the, process, and, in, march, 1788, mcgrigor, was, able, to, bleach, 1, 500, yards, 4, 500, feet, of, cloth, to, his, satisfaction, about, this, time, berthollet, discovered, the, salt, and, sulphuric, acid, process, and, published, it, so, it, became, public, knowledge, many, others, began, to, experiment, with, improving, the, process, which, still, had, many, shortcomings, not, the, least, of, which, was, the, problem, of, transporting, the, liquid, product, watt, s, rivals, soon, overtook, him, in, developing, the, process, and, he, dropped, out, of, the, race, it, was, not, until, 1799, when, charles, tennant, patented, a, process, for, producing, solid, bleaching, powder, calcium, hypochlorite, that, it, became, a, commercial, success, by, 1794, watt, had, been, chosen, by, thomas, beddoes, to, manufacture, apparatuses, to, produce, clean, and, store, gases, for, use, in, the, new, pneumatic, institution, at, hotwells, in, bristol, watt, continued, to, experiment, with, various, gases, but, by, 1797, the, medical, uses, for, the, factitious, airs, artificial, gases, had, come, to, a, dead, end, watt, combined, theoretical, knowledge, of, science, with, the, ability, to, apply, it, practically, chemist, humphry, davy, said, of, him, those, who, consider, james, watt, only, as, a, great, practical, mechanic, form, a, very, erroneous, idea, of, his, character, he, was, equally, distinguished, as, a, natural, philosopher, and, a, chemist, and, his, inventions, demonstrate, his, profound, knowledge, of, those, sciences, and, that, peculiar, characteristic, of, genius, the, union, of, them, for, practical, application, he, was, greatly, respected, by, other, prominent, men, of, the, industrial, revolution, he, was, an, important, member, of, the, lunar, society, of, birmingham, and, was, a, much, sought, after, conversationalist, and, companion, always, interested, in, expanding, his, horizons, his, personal, relationships, with, his, friends, and, business, partners, were, always, congenial, and, long, lasting, according, to, lord, liverpool, prime, minister, of, the, uk, a, more, excllent, and, amikable, man, in, all, the, relations, of, life, i, believe, never, existed, watt, was, a, prolific, correspondent, during, his, years, in, cornwall, he, wrote, long, letters, to, boulton, several, times, per, week, he, was, averse, to, publishing, his, results, in, for, example, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, however, and, instead, preferred, to, communicate, his, ideas, in, patents, he, was, an, excellent, draughtsman, he, was, a, rather, poor, businessman, and, especially, hated, bargaining, and, negotiating, terms, with, those, who, sought, to, use, the, steam, engine, in, a, letter, to, william, small, in, 1772, watt, confessed, that, he, would, rather, face, a, loaded, cannon, than, settle, an, account, or, make, a, bargain, until, he, retired, he, was, always, very, concerned, about, his, financial, affairs, and, was, something, of, a, worrier, his, health, was, often, poor, and, he, suffered, frequent, nervous, headaches, and, depression, when, he, retired, in, 1800, he, became, a, rich, enough, man, to, pass, the, business, on, to, his, sons, at, first, the, partnership, made, the, drawings, and, specifications, for, the, engines, and, supervised, the, work, to, erect, them, on, the, customers, property, they, produced, almost, none, of, the, parts, themselves, watt, did, most, of, his, work, at, his, home, in, harper, s, hill, in, birmingham, while, boulton, worked, at, the, soho, manufactory, gradually, the, partners, began, to, actually, manufacture, more, and, more, of, the, parts, and, by, 1795, they, purchased, a, property, about, a, mile, away, from, the, soho, manufactory, on, the, banks, of, the, birmingham, canal, to, establish, a, new, foundry, for, the, manufacture, of, the, engines, the, soho, foundry, formally, opened, in, 1796, at, a, time, when, watt, s, sons, gregory, and, james, jr, were, heavily, involved, in, the, management, of, the, enterprise, in, 1800, the, year, of, watt, s, retirement, the, firm, made, a, total, of, 41, engines, watt, retired, in, 1800, the, same, year, that, his, fundamental, patent, and, partnership, with, boulton, expired, the, famous, partnership, was, transferred, to, the, men, s, sons, matthew, robinson, boulton, and, james, watt, junior,
