then, enrolled, in, the, bucharest, school, of, fine, arts, where, he, received, academic, training, in, sculpture, he, worked, hard, and, quickly, distinguished, himself, as, talented, one, of, his, earliest, surviving, works, under, the, guidance, of, his, anatomy, teacher, dimitrie, gerota, is, a, masterfully, rendered, corch, statue, of, a, man, with, skin, removed, to, reveal, the, muscles, underneath, which, was, exhibited, at, the, romanian, athenaeum, in, 1903, though, just, an, anatomical, study, it, foreshadowed, the, sculptor, s, later, efforts, to, reveal, essence, rather, than, merely, copy, outward, appearance, in, 1903, br, ncu, i, traveled, to, munich, and, from, there, to, paris, in, paris, he, was, welcomed, by, the, community, of, artists, and, intellectuals, brimming, with, new, ideas, he, worked, for, two, years, in, the, workshop, of, antonin, merci, of, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, and, was, invited, to, enter, the, workshop, of, auguste, rodin, even, though, he, admired, the, eminent, rodin, he, left, the, rodin, studio, after, only, two, months, saying, nothing, can, grow, under, big, trees, after, leaving, rodin, s, workshop, br, ncu, i, began, developing, the, revolutionary, style, for, which, he, is, known, his, first, commissioned, work, the, prayer, was, part, of, a, gravestone, memorial, it, depicts, a, young, woman, crossing, herself, as, she, kneels, and, marks, the, first, step, toward, abstracted, non, literal, representation, and, shows, his, drive, to, depict, not, the, outer, form, but, the, idea, the, essence, of, things, he, also, began, doing, more, carving, rather, than, the, method, popular, with, his, contemporaries, that, of, modeling, in, clay, or, plaster, which, would, be, cast, in, metal, and, by, 1908, he, worked, almost, exclusively, by, carving, in, the, following, few, years, he, made, many, versions, of, sleeping, muse, and, the, kiss, further, simplifying, forms, to, geometrical, and, sparse, objects, his, works, became, popular, in, france, romania, and, the, united, states, collectors, notably, john, quinn, bought, his, pieces, and, reviewers, praised, his, works, in, 1913, br, ncu, i, s, work, was, displayed, at, both, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, and, the, first, exhibition, in, the, u, s, of, modern, art, the, armory, show, in, 1920, he, developed, a, notorious, reputation, with, the, entry, of, princess, x, in, the, salon, the, phallic, appearance, of, this, large, gleaming, bronze, piece, scandalized, the, salon, and, despite, br, ncu, i, s, explanation, that, it, was, simply, meant, to, represent, the, essence, of, womanhood, it, was, removed, from, the, exhibition, princess, x, was, revealed, to, be, princess, marie, bonaparte, direct, descendant, of, the, younger, brother, of, napoleon, bonaparte, the, sculpture, has, been, interpreted, by, some, as, symbolizing, her, obsession, with, the, penis, and, her, lifelong, quest, to, achieve, vaginal, orgasm, with, the, help, of, sigmund, freud, around, this, time, br, ncu, i, began, crafting, the, bases, for, his, sculptures, with, much, care, and, originality, because, he, considered, them, important, to, the, works, themselves, one, of, his, major, groups, of, sculptures, involved, the, bird, in, space, simple, abstract, shapes, representing, a, bird, in, flight, the, works, are, based, on, his, earlier, m, iastra, series, in, romanian, folklore, the, m, iastra, is, a, beautiful, golden, bird, who, foretells, the, future, and, cures, the, blind, over, the, following, 20, years, br, ncu, i, made, multiple, versions, of, bird, in, space, out, of, marble, or, bronze, athena, tacha, spear, s, book, br, ncu, i, s, birds, caa, monographs, xxi, nyu, press, new, york, 1969, first, sorted, out, the, 36, versions, and, their, development, from, the, early, m, iastra, to, the, golden, bird, of, the, late, teens, to, the, bird, in, space, which, emerged, in, the, early, 1920s, and, which, br, ncu, i, developed, throughout, his, life, one, of, these, versions, caused, a, major, controversy, in, 1926, when, photographer, edward, steichen, purchased, it, and, shipped, it, to, the, united, states, customs, officers, did, not, accept, the, bird, as, a, work, of, art, and, assessed, customs, duty, on, its, import, as, an, industrial, item, after, protracted, court, proceedings, this, assessment, was, overturned, thus, confirming, the, bird, s, status, as, a, duty, exempt, work, of, art, the, verdict, was, somewhat, influenced, by, the, judge, justice, waite, s, personal, appreciation, of, the, art, calling, it, beautiful, symmetrical, and, ornamental, the, ruling, also, established, the, important, principle, that, art, does, not, have, to, involve, a, realistic, representation, of, nature, and, that, it, was, legitimate, for, it, to, simply, represent, an, abstract, concept, in, this, case, flight, his, work, became, increasingly, popular, in, the, u, s, where, he, visited, several, times, during, his, life, worldwide, fame, in, 1933, brought, him, the, commission, of, building, a, meditation, temple, the, temple, of, deliverance, in, india, for, the,

year, old, artist, not, only, because, of, the, artistic, influence, of, brancusi, and, exploration, of, biomorphic, abstraction, in, sculpture, but, also, because, of, the, way, which, hunt, chose,
