seleucus, i, nicator, s, l, u, k, s, greek, s, leukos, nik, t, r, lit, seleucus, the, victorious, c, 358, 281, bc, was, a, macedonian, greek, general, officer, and, successor, of, alexander, the, great, who, went, on, to, found, the, eponymous, seleucid, empire, led, by, the, seleucid, dynasty, initially, a, secondary, player, in, the, power, struggles, following, alexander, s, death, seleucus, rose, to, become, the, total, ruler, of, asia, minor, syria, mesopotamia, and, the, iranian, plateau, assuming, the, title, of, basileus, king, the, seleucid, empire, was, one, of, the, major, powers, of, the, hellenistic, world, until, it, was, overcome, by, the, roman, republic, and, parthian, empire, in, the, late, second, and, early, first, centuries, bc, while, serving, under, alexander, seleucus, was, commander, of, the, hypaspistai, or, silver, shields, an, elite, macedonian, infantry, unit, after, the, death, of, alexander, in, june, 323, bc, seleucus, initially, supported, perdiccas, the, regent, of, alexander, s, empire, and, was, appointed, commander, of, the, companions, and, chiliarch, at, the, partition, of, babylon, in, 323, bc, however, after, the, outbreak, of, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, in, 322, perdiccas, military, failures, against, ptolemy, in, egypt, led, to, the, mutiny, of, his, troops, in, pelusium, perdiccas, was, betrayed, and, assassinated, in, a, conspiracy, by, seleucus, peithon, and, antigenes, in, pelusium, sometime, in, either, 321, or, 320, bc, at, the, partition, of, triparadisus, in, 321, bc, seleucus, was, appointed, satrap, of, babylon, under, the, new, regent, antipater, but, almost, immediately, the, wars, between, the, diadochi, resumed, and, one, of, the, most, powerful, of, the, diadochi, antigonus, forced, seleucus, to, flee, babylon, seleucus, was, only, able, to, return, to, babylon, in, 312, bc, with, the, support, of, ptolemy, from, 312, bc, seleucus, ruthlessly, expanded, his, dominions, and, eventually, conquered, the, persian, and, median, lands, seleucus, ruled, not, only, babylonia, but, the, entire, eastern, part, of, alexander, s, empire, seleucus, further, made, claim, to, the, former, satrapies, in, gandhara, and, in, eastern, india, however, these, ambitions, were, contested, by, chandragupta, maurya, resulting, in, the, seleucid, mauryan, war, 305, 303, bc, the, conflict, was, ultimately, resolved, by, a, treaty, resulting, in, the, maurya, empire, annexing, the, eastern, satrapies, additionally, a, marriage, alliance, was, formed, with, chandragupta, marrying, a, daughter, of, seleucus, according, to, strabo, and, appian, furthermore, the, seleucid, empire, received, a, considerable, military, force, of, 500, war, elephants, with, mahouts, which, would, play, a, decisive, role, against, antigonus, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, in, 281, bc, he, also, defeated, lysimachus, at, the, battle, of, corupedium, adding, asia, minor, to, his, empire, seleucus, victories, against, antigonus, and, lysimachus, left, the, seleucid, dynasty, virtually, unopposed, amongst, the, diadochi, however, seleucus, also, hoped, to, take, control, of, lysimachus, european, territories, primarily, thrace, and, macedon, itself, but, upon, arriving, in, thrace, in, 281, bc, seleucus, was, assassinated, by, ptolemy, ceraunus, who, had, taken, refuge, at, the, seleucid, court, with, his, sister, lysandra, the, assassination, of, seleucus, destroyed, seleucid, prospects, in, thrace, and, macedon, and, paved, the, way, for, ptolemy, ceraunus, to, absorb, much, of, lysimachus, former, power, in, macedon, seleucus, was, succeeded, by, his, son, antiochus, i, as, ruler, of, the, seleucid, empire, seleucus, founded, a, number, of, new, cities, during, his, reign, including, antioch, 300, bc, edessa, and, seleucia, on, the, tigris, c, 305, bc, a, foundation, that, eventually, depopulated, babylon, seleucus, was, the, son, of, antiochus, historian, junianus, justinus, claims, that, antiochus, was, one, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, s, generals, but, no, such, general, is, mentioned, in, any, other, sources, and, nothing, is, known, of, his, supposed, career, under, philip, it, is, possible, that, antiochus, was, a, member, of, an, upper, macedonian, noble, family, seleucus, mother, was, supposedly, called, laodice, but, nothing, else, is, known, of, her, later, seleucus, named, a, number, of, cities, after, his, parents, seleucus, was, born, in, europus, located, in, the, northern, part, of, macedonia, just, a, year, before, his, birth, if, the, year, 358, bc, is, accepted, as, the, most, likely, date, the, paeonians, invaded, the, region, philip, defeated, the, invaders, and, only, a, few, years, later, utterly, subdued, them, under, macedonian, rule, seleucus, year, of, birth, is, unclear, justin, claims, he, was, 77, years, old, during, the, battle, of, corupedium, which, would, place, his, year, of, birth, at, 358, bc, appian, tells, us, seleucus, was, 73, years, old, during, the, battle, which, means, 354, bc, would, be, the, year, of, birth, eusebius, of, caesarea, however, mentions, the, age, of, 75, and, thus, the, year, 356, bc, making, seleucus, the, same, age, as, alexander, the, great, this, is, most, likely, propaganda, on, seleucus, part, to, make, him, seem, comparable, to, alexander, as, a, teenager, seleucus, was, chosen, to, serve, as, the, king, s, page, pais, it, was, customary, for, all, male, offspring, of, noble, families, to, first, serve, in, this, position, and, later, as, officers, in, the, king, s, army, seleucus, like, his, later, rivals, antigonus, i, monophthalmus, and, demetrius, i, of, macedon, was, reportedly, a, very, large, and, powerful, man, appian, wrote, of, an, incident, in, which, a, wild, bull, that, was, about, to, be, sacrificed, by, alexander, broke, free, of, its, bounds, and, seleucus, managed, to, restrain, the, animal, just, with, his, bare, hands, this, was, apparently, the, reason, for, the, bull, horns, often, depicted, in, the, coins, he, later, minted, as, a, sovereign, a, number, of, legends, similar, to, those, told, of, alexander, the, great, were, told, of, seleucus, it, was, said, antiochus, told, his, son, before, he, left, to, battle, the, persians, with, alexander, that, his, real, father, was, actually, the, god, apollo, the, god, had, left, a, ring, with, a, picture, of, an, anchor, as, a, gift, to, laodice, seleucus, had, a, birthmark, shaped, like, an, anchor, it, was, told, that, seleucus, sons, and, grandsons, also, had, similar, birthmarks, the, story, is, similar, to, the, one, told, about, alexander, most, likely, the, story, is, propaganda, invented, to, present, seleucus, as, the, natural, successor, of, alexander, john, malalas, tells, us, seleucus, had, a, sister, called, didymeia, who, had, sons, called, nicanor, and, nicomedes, it, is, most, likely, the, sons, are, fictitious, didymeia, might, refer, to, the, oracle, of, apollo, in, didyma, near, miletus, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, ptolemy, son, of, seleucus, was, actually, the, uncle, of, seleucus, in, spring, 334, bc, as, a, young, man, of, about, twenty, three, seleucus, accompanied, alexander, into, asia, by, the, time, of, the, indian, campaigns, beginning, in, late, in, 327, bc, he, had, risen, to, the, command, of, the, elite, infantry, corps, in, the, macedonian, army, the, shield, bearers, hypaspistai, later, known, as, the, silvershields, it, is, said, by, arrian, that, when, alexander, crossed, the, hydaspes, river, on, a, boat, he, was, accompanied, by, perdiccas, ptolemy, i, soter, lysimachus, and, also, seleucus, during, the, subsequent, battle, of, the, hydaspes, 326, bc, seleucus, led, his, troops, against, the, elephants, of, king, porus, it, is, unknown, the, extent, in, which, seleucus, participated, in, the, actual, planning, of, the, battle, as, he, is, not, mentioned, as, holding, any, major, independent, position, during, the, battle, this, contrasts, with, craterus, hephaistion, peithon, and, leonnatus, each, of, whom, had, sizable, detachments, under, their, control, seleucus, royal, hypaspistai, were, constantly, under, alexander, s, eye, and, at, his, disposal, they, later, participated, in, the, indus, valley, campaign, in, the, battles, fought, against, the, malli, and, in, the, crossing, of, the, gedrosian, desert, at, the, great, marriage, ceremony, at, susa, in, the, spring, of, 324, bc, seleucus, married, apama, daughter, of, spitamenes, they, had, his, eldest, son, and, successor, antiochus, i, soter, at, least, two, legitimate, daughters, laodice, and, apama, and, possibly, another, son, achaeus, at, the, same, event, alexander, married, the, daughter, of, the, late, persian, king, darius, iii, while, several, other, macedonians, married, persian, women, after, alexander, s, death, 323, bc, when, the, other, senior, macedonian, officers, unloaded, their, susa, wives, en, masse, seleucus, was, one, of, the, very, few, who, kept, his, wife, and, apama, remained, his, consort, later, queen, for, the, rest, of, her, life, ancient, sources, report, several, anecdotes, about, seleucus, activities, during, the, life, of, alexander, in, the, first, of, these, episodes, he, participated, in, a, sailing, trip, near, babylon, where, alexander, s, diadem, was, blown, off, his, head, and, landed, on, some, reeds, near, the, tombs, of, assyrian, kings, seleucus, swam, to, fetch, the, diadem, back, placing, it, on, his, own, head, while, returning, to, the, boat, to, keep, it, dry, the, validity, of, the, story, is, dubious, in, the, second, he, took, part, in, the, dinner, party, of, medeios, the, thessalian, with, alexander, the, story, of, the, dinner, party, of, medeios, may, be, true, but, the, plot, to, poison, the, king, is, unlikely, in, the, final, story, seleucus, reportedly, slept, in, the, temple, of, the, god, serapis, shortly, before, alexander, s, death, in, the, hope, that, his, health, might, improve, the, validity, of, this, story, is, also, questionable, as, the, graeco, egyptian, serapis, had, not, yet, been, invented, at, the, time, alexander, the, great, died, without, a, successor, in, babylon, on, june, 10, 323, bc, his, general, perdiccas, became, the, regent, of, all, of, alexander, s, empire, while, alexander, s, physically, and, mentally, disabled, half, brother, arrhidaeus, was, chosen, as, the, next, king, under, the, name, philip, iii, of, macedon, alexander, s, unborn, child, alexander, iv, was, also, named, his, father, s, successor, in, the, partition, of, babylon, however, perdiccas, effectively, divided, the, enormous, macedonian, dominion, among, alexander, s, generals, seleucus, was, chosen, to, command, the, companion, cavalry, hetairoi, and, appointed, first, or, court, chiliarch, which, made, him, the, senior, officer, in, the, royal, army, after, the, regent, and, commander, in, chief, perdiccas, several, other, powerful, men, supported, perdiccas, including, ptolemy, lysimachus, peithon, and, eumenes, perdiccas, power, depended, on, his, ability, to, hold, alexander, s, enormous, empire, together, and, on, whether, he, could, force, the, satraps, to, obey, him, war, soon, broke, out, between, perdiccas, and, the, other, diadochi, to, cement, his, position, perdiccas, tried, to, marry, alexander, s, sister, cleopatra, the, first, war, of, the, diadochi, began, when, perdiccas, sent, alexander, s, corpse, to, macedonia, for, burial, ptolemy, however, captured, the, body, and, took, it, to, alexandria, perdiccas, and, his, troops, followed, him, to, egypt, whereupon, ptolemy, conspired, with, the, satrap, of, media, peithon, and, the, commander, of, the, argyraspides, antigenes, both, serving, as, officers, under, perdiccas, and, assassinated, him, cornelius, nepos, mentions, that, seleucus, also, took, part, in, this, conspiracy, but, this, is, not, certain, the, most, powerful, man, in, the, empire, after, the, death, of, perdiccas, was, antipater, perdiccas, opponents, gathered, in, triparadisos, where, the, empire, of, alexander, was, partitioned, again, the, treaty, of, triparadisus, 321, bc, at, triparadisos, the, soldiers, had, become, mutinous, and, were, planning, to, murder, their, master, antipater, seleucus, and, antigonus, however, prevented, this, for, betraying, perdiccas, seleucus, was, awarded, the, rich, province, of, babylon, this, decision, may, have, been, antigonus, idea, seleucus, babylon, was, surrounded, by, peucestas, the, satrap, of, persis, antigenes, the, new, satrap, of, susiana, and, peithon, of, media, babylon, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, provinces, of, the, empire, but, its, military, power, was, insignificant, it, is, possible, that, antipater, divided, the, eastern, provinces, so, that, no, single, satrap, could, rise, above, the, others, in, power, after, the, death, of, alexander, archon, of, pella, was, chosen, satrap, of, babylon, perdiccas, however, had, plans, to, supersede, archon, and, nominate, docimus, as, his, successor, during, his, invasion, of, egypt, perdiccas, sent, docimus, along, with, his, detachments, to, babylon, archon, waged, war, against, him, but, fell, in, battle, thus, docimus, was, not, intending, to, give, babylon, to, seleucus, without, a, fight, it, is, not, certain, how, seleucus, took, babylon, from, docimus, but, according, to, one, babylonian, chronicle, an, important, building, was, destroyed, in, the, city, during, the, summer, or, winter, of, 320, bc, other, babylonian, sources, state, that, seleucus, arrived, in, babylon, in, october, or, november, 320, bc, despite, the, presumed, battle, docimus, was, able, to, escape, meanwhile, the, empire, was, once, again, in, turmoil, peithon, the, satrap, of, media, assassinated, philip, the, satrap, of, parthia, and, replaced, him, with, his, brother, eudemus, as, the, new, satrap, in, the, west, antigonus, and, eumenes, waged, war, against, each, other, just, like, peithon, and, seleucus, eumenes, was, one, of, the, former, supporters, of, perdiccas, seleucus, biggest, problem, was, however, babylon, itself, the, locals, had, rebelled, against, archon, and, supported, docimus, the, babylonian, priesthood, had, great, influence, over, the, region, babylon, also, had, a, sizeable, population, of, macedonian, and, greek, veterans, of, alexander, s, army, seleucus, won, over, the, priests, with, monetary, gifts, and, bribes, after, the, death, of, antipater, in, 319, bc, the, satrap, of, media, began, to, expand, his, power, peithon, assembled, a, large, army, of, perhaps, over, 20, 000, soldiers, under, the, leadership, of, peucestas, the, other, satraps, of, the, region, brought, together, an, opposing, army, of, their, own, peithon, was, finally, defeated, in, a, battle, waged, in, parthia, he, escaped, to, media, but, his, opponents, did, not, follow, him, and, rather, returned, to, susiana, meanwhile, eumenes, and, his, army, had, arrived, at, cilicia, but, had, to, retreat, when, antigonus, reached, the, city, the, situation, was, difficult, for, seleucus, eumenes, and, his, army, were, north, of, babylon, antigonus, was, following, him, with, an, even, larger, army, peithon, was, in, media, and, his, opponents, in, susiana, antigenes, satrap, of, susiana, and, commander, of, the, argyraspides, was, allied, with, eumenes, antigenes, was, in, cilicia, when, the, war, between, him, and, peithon, began, peithon, arrived, at, babylon, in, the, autumn, or, winter, of, 317, bc, peithon, had, lost, a, large, number, of, troops, but, seleucus, had, even, fewer, soldiers, eumenes, decided, to, march, to, susa, in, the, spring, of, 316, bc, the, satraps, in, susa, had, apparently, accepted, eumenes, claims, of, his, fighting, on, behalf, of, the, lawful, ruling, family, against, the, usurper, antigonus, eumenes, marched, his, army, 300, stadions, away, from, babylon, and, tried, to, cross, the, tigris, seleucus, had, to, act, he, sent, two, triremes, and, some, smaller, ships, to, stop, the, crossing, he, also, tried, to, get, the, former, hypasiti, of, the, argyraspides, to, join, him, but, this, did, not, happen, seleucus, also, sent, messages, to, antigonus, because, of, his, lack, of, troops, seleucus, apparently, had, no, plans, to, actually, stop, eumenes, he, opened, the, flood, barriers, of, the, river, but, the, resulting, flood, did, not, stop, eumenes, in, the, spring, of, 316, bc, seleucus, and, peithon, joined, antigonus, who, was, following, eumenes, to, susa, from, susa, antigonus, went, to, media, from, where, he, could, threaten, the, eastern, provinces, he, left, seleucus, with, a, small, number, of, troops, to, prevent, eumenes, from, reaching, the, mediterranean, sibyrtius, satrap, of, arachosia, saw, the, situation, as, hopeless, and, returned, to, his, own, province, the, armies, of, eumenes, and, his, allies, were, at, breaking, point, antigonus, and, eumenes, had, two, encounters, during, 316, bc, in, the, battles, of, paraitacene, and, gabiene, eumenes, was, defeated, and, executed, the, events, of, the, second, war, of, the, diadochi, revealed, seleucus, ability, to, wait, for, the, right, moment, blazing, into, battle, was, not, his, style, antigonus, spent, the, winter, of, 316, bc, in, media, whose, ruler, was, once, again, peithon, peithon, s, lust, for, power, had, grown, and, he, tried, to, get, a, portion, of, antigonus, troops, to, revolt, to, his, side, antigonus, however, discovered, the, plot, and, executed, peithon, he, then, superseded, peucestas, as, satrap, of, persia, in, the, summer, of, 315, bc, antigonus, arrived, in, babylon, and, was, warmly, welcomed, by, seleucus, the, relationship, between, the, two, soon, turned, cold, however, seleucus, punished, one, of, antigonus, officers, without, asking, permission, from, antigonus, antigonus, became, angry, and, demanded, that, seleucus, give, him, the, income, from, the, province, which, seleucus, refused, to, do, he, was, however, afraid, of, antigonus, and, fled, to, egypt, with, 50, horsemen, it, is, told, that, chaldean, astrologers, prophesied, to, antigonus, that, seleucus, would, become, master, of, asia, and, would, kill, antigonus, after, hearing, this, antigonus, sent, soldiers, after, seleucus, who, had, however, first, escaped, to, mesopotamia, and, then, to, syria, antigonus, executed, blitor, the, new, satrap, of, mesopotamia, for, helping, seleucus, modern, scholars, are, skeptical, of, the, prophecy, story, it, seems, certain, however, that, the, babylonian, priesthood, was, against, seleucus, during, seleucus, escape, to, egypt, macedonia, was, undergoing, great, turmoil, alexander, the, great, s, mother, olympias, had, been, invited, back, to, macedon, by, polyperchon, in, order, to, drive, cassander, out, she, held, great, respect, among, the, macedonian, army, but, lost, some, of, this, when, she, had, philip, iii, and, his, wife, eurydice, killed, as, well, as, many, nobles, whom, she, took, revenge, upon, for, supporting, antipater, during, his, long, reign, cassander, reclaimed, macedon, the, following, year, at, pydna, and, then, had, her, killed, alexander, iv, still, a, young, child, and, his, mother, roxane, were, held, guarded, at, amphipolis, and, died, under, mysterious, circumstances, in, 310, bc, probably, murdered, at, the, instigation, of, cassander, to, allow, the, diadochs, to, assume, the, title, of, king, after, arriving, in, egypt, seleucus, sent, his, friends, to, greece, to, inform, his, fellow, diadochi, cassander, ruler, of, macedon, and, overlord, of, greece, and, lysimachus, ruler, of, thracia, about, antigonus, antigonus, was, now, the, most, powerful, of, the, diadochi, and, the, others, would, soon, have, to, face, him, ptolemy, lysimachus, and, cassander, formed, a, coalition, against, antigonus, the, allies, sent, a, proposition, to, antigonus, in, which, they, demanded, shares, of, his, accumulated, treasure, and, of, his, territory, with, phoenica, and, syria, going, to, ptolemy, cappadocia, and, lycia, to, cassander, hellespontine, phrygia, to, lysimachus, and, babylonia, to, seleucus, antigonus, refused, and, in, the, spring, of, 314, bc, he, marched, against, ptolemy, in, syria, seleucus, acted, as, an, admiral, to, ptolemy, during, the, first, phase, of, the, war, antigonus, was, besieging, tyre, when, seleucus, sailed, past, him, and, went, on, to, threaten, the, coast, of, syria, and, asia, minor, antigonus, allied, with, the, island, of, rhodes, which, had, a, strategic, location, and, a, navy, capable, of, preventing, the, allies, from, combining, their, forces, because, of, the, threat, of, rhodes, ptolemy, gave, seleucus, a, hundred, ships, and, sent, him, to, the, aegean, sea, the, fleet, was, too, small, to, defeat, rhodes, but, it, was, big, enough, to, force, asander, the, satrap, of, caria, to, ally, with, ptolemy, to, demonstrate, his, power, seleucus, also, invaded, the, city, of, erythrai, polemaios, a, nephew, of, antigonus, attacked, asander, seleucus, returned, to, cyprus, where, ptolemy, i, had, sent, his, brother, menelaos, along, with, 10, 000, mercenaries, and, 100, ships, seleucus, and, menelaos, began, to, besiege, kition, antigonus, sent, most, of, his, fleet, to, the, aegean, sea, and, his, army, to, asia, minor, ptolemy, now, had, an, opportunity, to, invade, syria, where, he, defeated, demetrius, the, son, of, antigonus, in, the, battle, of, gaza, in, 312, bc, it, is, probable, that, seleucus, took, part, in, the, battle, peithon, son, of, agenor, whom, antigonus, had, nominated, as, the, new, satrap, of, babylon, fell, in, the, battle, the, death, of, peithon, gave, seleucus, an, opportunity, to, return, to, babylon, seleucus, had, prepared, his, return, to, babylon, well, after, the, battle, of, gaza, demetrius, retreated, to, tripoli, while, ptolemy, advanced, all, the, way, to, sidon, ptolemy, gave, seleucus, 800, infantry, and, 200, cavalry, he, also, had, his, friends, accompanying, him, perhaps, the, same, 50, who, escaped, with, him, from, babylon, on, the, way, to, babylon, seleucus, recruited, more, soldiers, from, the, colonies, along, the, route, he, finally, had, about, 3, 000, soldiers, in, babylon, peithon, s, commander, diphilus, barricaded, himself, in, the, city, s, fortress, seleucus, conquered, babylon, with, great, speed, and, the, fortress, was, also, quickly, captured, seleucus, friends, who, had, stayed, in, babylon, were, released, from, captivity, his, return, to, babylon, was, afterwards, officially, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, the, seleucid, empire, and, that, year, as, the, first, of, the, seleucid, era, soon, after, seleucus, return, the, supporters, of, antigonus, tried, to, get, babylon, back, nicanor, was, the, new, satrap, of, media, and, the, strategos, of, the, eastern, provinces, his, army, had, about, 17, 000, soldiers, evagoras, the, satrap, of, aria, was, allied, with, him, it, was, obvious, that, seleucus, small, force, could, not, defeat, the, two, in, battle, seleucus, hid, his, armies, in, the, marshes, that, surrounded, the, area, where, nicanor, was, planning, to, cross, the, tigris, and, made, a, surprise, attack, during, the, night, evagoras, fell, in, the, beginning, of, the, battle, and, nicanor, was, cut, off, from, his, forces, the, news, about, the, death, of, evagoras, spread, among, the, soldiers, who, started, to, surrender, en, masse, almost, all, of, them, agreed, to, fight, under, seleucus, nicanor, escaped, with, only, a, few, men, even, though, seleucus, now, had, about, 20, 000, soldiers, they, were, not, enough, to, withstand, the, forces, of, antigonus, he, also, did, not, know, when, antigonus, would, begin, his, counterattack, on, the, other, hand, he, knew, that, at, least, two, eastern, provinces, did, not, have, a, satrap, a, great, majority, of, his, own, troops, were, from, these, provinces, some, of, evagoras, troops, were, persian, perhaps, a, portion, of, the, troops, were, eumenes, soldiers, who, had, a, reason, to, hate, antigonus, seleucus, decided, to, take, advantage, of, this, situation, seleucus, spread, different, stories, among, the, provinces, and, the, soldiers, according, to, one, of, them, he, had, in, a, dream, seen, alexander, standing, beside, him, eumenes, had, tried, to, use, a, similar, propaganda, trick, antigonus, who, had, been, in, asia, minor, while, seleucus, had, been, in, the, east, with, alexander, could, not, use, alexander, in, his, own, propaganda, seleucus, being, macedonian, had, the, ability, to, gain, the, trust, of, the, macedonians, among, his, troops, which, was, not, the, case, with, eumenes, after, becoming, once, again, satrap, of, babylon, seleucus, became, much, more, aggressive, in, his, politics, in, a, short, time, he, conquered, media, and, susiana, diodorus, siculus, reports, that, seleucus, also, conquered, other, nearby, areas, which, might, refer, to, persis, aria, or, parthia, seleucus, did, not, reach, bactria, and, sogdiana, the, satrap, of, the, former, was, stasanor, who, had, remained, neutral, during, the, conflicts, after, the, defeat, of, nikanor, s, army, there, was, no, force, in, the, east, that, could, have, opposed, seleucus, it, is, uncertain, how, seleucus, arranged, the, administration, of, the, provinces, he, had, conquered, most, satraps, had, died, in, theory, polyperchon, was, still, the, lawful, successor, of, antipater, and, the, official, regent, of, the, macedonian, kingdom, it, was, his, duty, to, select, the, satraps, however, polyperchon, was, still, allied, with, antigonus, and, thus, an, enemy, of, seleucus, antigonus, sent, his, son, demetrius, along, with, 15, 000, infantry, and, 4, 000, cavalry, to, reconquer, babylon, apparently, he, gave, demetrius, a, time, limit, after, which, he, had, to, return, to, syria, antigonus, believed, seleucus, was, still, ruling, only, babylon, perhaps, nicanor, had, not, told, him, that, seleucus, now, had, at, least, 20, 000, soldiers, it, seems, that, the, scale, of, nicanor, s, defeat, was, not, clear, to, all, parties, antigonus, did, not, know, seleucus, had, conquered, the, majority, of, the, eastern, provinces, and, perhaps, cared, little, about, the, eastern, parts, of, the, empire, when, demetrius, arrived, in, babylon, seleucus, was, somewhere, in, the, east, he, had, left, patrocles, to, defend, the, city, babylon, was, defended, in, an, unusual, way, it, had, two, strong, fortresses, in, which, seleucus, had, left, his, garrisons, the, inhabitants, of, the, city, were, transferred, out, and, settled, in, the, neighbouring, areas, some, as, far, as, susa, the, surroundings, of, babylon, were, excellent, for, defence, with, cities, swamps, canals, and, rivers, demetrius, troops, started, to, besiege, the, fortresses, of, babylon, and, conquered, one, of, them, the, second, fortress, proved, more, difficult, for, demetrius, he, left, his, friend, archelaus, to, continue, the, siege, and, himself, returned, west, leaving, 5, 000, infantry, and, 1, 000, cavalry, in, babylon, ancient, sources, do, not, mention, what, happened, to, these, troops, perhaps, seleucus, had, to, reconquer, babylon, from, archelaus, over, the, course, of, nine, years, 311, 302, bc, while, antigonus, was, occupied, in, the, west, seleucus, brought, the, whole, eastern, part, of, alexander, s, empire, as, far, as, the, jaxartes, and, indus, rivers, under, his, authority, in, 311, bc, antigonus, made, peace, with, cassander, lysimachus, and, ptolemy, which, gave, him, an, opportunity, to, deal, with, seleucus, antigonus, army, had, at, least, 80, 000, soldiers, even, if, he, left, half, of, his, troops, in, the, west, he, would, still, have, a, numerical, advantage, over, seleucus, seleucus, may, have, received, help, from, cossaians, whose, ancestors, were, the, ancient, kassites, antigonus, had, devastated, their, lands, while, fighting, eumenes, seleucus, perhaps, recruited, a, portion, of, archelaus, troops, when, antigonus, finally, invaded, babylon, seleucus, army, was, much, bigger, than, before, many, of, his, soldiers, certainly, hated, antigonus, the, population, of, babylon, was, also, hostile, seleucus, thus, did, not, need, to, garrison, the, area, to, keep, the, locals, from, revolting, little, information, is, available, about, the, conflict, between, antigonus, and, seleucus, only, a, very, rudimentary, babylonian, chronicle, detailing, the, events, of, the, war, remains, the, description, of, the, year, 310, bc, has, completely, disappeared, it, seems, that, antigonus, conquered, babylon, his, plans, were, disturbed, however, by, ptolemy, who, made, a, surprise, attack, in, cilicia, we, do, know, that, seleucus, defeated, antigonus, in, at, least, one, decisive, battle, this, battle, is, only, mentioned, in, stratagems, in, war, by, polyaenus, polyaenus, reports, that, the, troops, of, seleucus, and, antigonus, fought, for, a, whole, day, but, when, night, came, the, battle, was, still, undecided, the, two, forces, agreed, to, rest, for, the, night, and, continue, in, the, morning, antigonus, troops, slept, without, their, equipment, seleucus, ordered, his, forces, to, sleep, and, eat, breakfast, in, battle, formation, shortly, before, dawn, seleucus, troops, attacked, the, forces, of, antigonus, who, were, still, without, their, weapons, and, in, disarray, and, thus, easily, defeated, the, historical, accuracy, of, the, story, is, questionable, the, babylonian, war, finally, ended, in, seleucus, victory, antigonus, was, forced, to, retreat, west, both, sides, fortified, their, borders, antigonus, built, a, series, of, fortresses, along, the, balikh, river, while, seleucus, built, a, few, cities, including, dura, europos, and, nisibis, the, next, event, connected, to, seleucus, was, the, founding, of, the, city, of, seleucia, the, city, was, built, on, the, shore, of, the, tigris, probably, in, 307, or, 305, bc, seleucus, made, seleucia, his, new, capital, thus, imitating, lysimachus, cassander, and, antigonus, all, of, whom, had, named, cities, after, themselves, seleucus, also, transferred, the, mint, of, babylon, to, his, new, city, babylon, was, soon, left, in, the, shadow, of, seleucia, and, the, story, goes, that, antiochus, the, son, of, seleucus, moved, the, whole, population, of, babylon, to, his, father, s, namesake, capital, in, 275, bc, the, city, flourished, until, ad, 165, when, the, romans, destroyed, it, a, story, of, the, founding, of, the, city, goes, as, follows, seleucus, asked, the, babylonian, priests, which, day, would, be, best, to, found, the, city, the, priest, calculated, the, day, but, wanting, the, founding, to, fail, told, seleucus, a, different, date, the, plot, failed, however, because, when, the, correct, day, came, seleucus, soldiers, spontaneously, started, building, the, city, when, questioned, the, priests, admitted, their, deed, the, struggle, among, the, diadochi, reached, its, climax, when, antigonus, after, the, extinction, of, the, old, royal, line, of, macedonia, proclaimed, himself, king, in, 306, bc, ptolemy, lysimachus, cassander, and, seleucus, the, other, four, principal, macedonian, chiefs, soon, followed, and, assumed, the, title, and, style, of, basileus, king, seleucus, soon, turned, his, attention, once, again, eastward, the, persian, provinces, in, what, is, now, modern, afghanistan, together, with, the, wealthy, kingdom, of, gandhara, and, the, states, of, the, indus, valley, had, all, submitted, to, alexander, the, great, and, become, part, of, his, empire, when, alexander, died, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, successors, split, his, empire, apart, as, his, generals, fought, for, control, of, alexander, s, empire, in, the, eastern, territories, seleucus, i, nicator, took, control, of, alexander, s, conquests, according, to, the, roman, historian, appian, always, lying, in, wait, for, the, neighboring, nations, strong, in, arms, and, persuasive, in, council, he, acquired, mesopotamia, armenia, seleucid, cappadocia, persis, parthia, bactria, arabia, tapouria, sogdia, arachosia, hyrcania, and, other, adjacent, peoples, that, had, been, subdued, by, alexander, as, far, as, the, river, indus, so, that, the, boundaries, of, his, empire, were, the, most, extensive, in, asia, after, that, of, alexander, the, whole, region, from, phrygia, to, the, indus, was, subject, to, seleucus, the, mauryans, then, annexed, the, areas, around, the, indus, governed, by, the, four, greek, satraps, nicanor, phillip, eudemus, and, peithon, this, established, mauryan, control, to, the, banks, of, the, indus, chandragupta, s, victories, convinced, seleucus, that, he, needed, to, secure, his, eastern, flank, seeking, to, hold, the, macedonian, territories, there, seleucus, thus, came, into, conflict, with, the, emerging, and, expanding, mauryan, empire, over, the, indus, valley, in, the, year, 306, bc, seleucus, i, nicator, went, to, india, and, apparently, occupied, territory, as, far, as, the, indus, and, eventually, waged, war, with, the, maurya, emperor, chandragupta, maurya, only, a, few, sources, mention, his, activities, in, india, chandragupta, known, in, greek, sources, as, sandrokottos, founder, of, the, mauryan, empire, had, conquered, the, indus, valley, and, several, other, parts, of, the, easternmost, regions, of, alexander, s, empire, seleucus, began, a, campaign, against, chandragupta, and, crossed, the, indus, most, western, historians, note, that, it, appears, to, have, fared, poorly, as, he, did, not, achieve, his, goals, even, though, what, exactly, happened, is, unknown, the, two, leaders, ultimately, reached, an, agreement, and, through, a, treaty, sealed, in, 303, bc, seleucus, abandoned, the, territories, he, could, never, securely, hold, in, exchange, for, stabilizing, the, east, and, obtaining, elephants, with, which, he, could, turn, his, attention, against, his, great, western, rival, antigonus, monophthalmus, the, 500, war, elephants, seleucus, obtained, from, chandragupta, were, to, play, a, key, role, in, the, forthcoming, battles, particularly, at, ipsus, against, antigonus, and, demetrius, the, maurya, king, might, have, married, the, daughter, of, seleucus, according, to, strabo, the, ceded, territories, bordered, the, indus, the, geographical, position, of, the, tribes, is, as, follows, along, the, indus, are, the, paropamisadae, above, whom, lies, the, paropamisus, mountain, then, towards, the, south, the, arachoti, then, next, towards, the, south, the, gedroseni, with, the, other, tribes, that, occupy, the, seaboard, and, the, indus, lies, latitudinally, alongside, all, these, places, and, of, these, places, in, part, some, that, lie, along, the, indus, are, held, by, indians, although, they, formerly, belonged, to, the, persians, alexander, took, these, away, from, the, arians, and, established, settlements, of, his, own, but, seleucus, nicator, gave, them, to, sandrocottus, upon, terms, of, intermarriage, and, of, receiving, in, exchange, five, hundred, elephants, strabo, 15, 2, 9, from, this, it, seems, that, seleucus, surrendered, the, easternmost, provinces, of, arachosia, gedrosia, paropamisadae, and, perhaps, also, aria, on, the, other, hand, he, was, accepted, by, other, satraps, of, the, eastern, provinces, his, persian, wife, apama, may, have, helped, him, implement, his, rule, in, bactria, and, sogdiana, this, would, tend, to, be, corroborated, archaeologically, as, concrete, indications, of, mauryan, influence, such, as, the, inscriptions, of, the, edicts, of, ashoka, which, are, known, to, be, located, in, for, example, kandhahar, in, today, s, southern, afghanistan, some, authors, say, that, the, argument, relating, to, seleucus, handing, over, more, of, what, is, now, southern, afghanistan, is, an, exaggeration, originating, in, a, statement, by, pliny, the, elder, referring, not, specifically, to, the, lands, received, by, chandragupta, but, rather, to, the, various, opinions, of, geographers, regarding, the, definition, of, the, word, india, most, geographers, in, fact, do, not, look, upon, india, as, bounded, by, the, river, indus, but, add, to, it, the, four, satrapies, of, the, gedrose, the, arachot, the, aria, and, the, paropamisad, the, river, cophes, thus, forming, the, extreme, boundary, of, india, according, to, other, writers, however, all, these, territories, are, reckoned, as, belonging, to, the, country, of, the, aria, pliny, natural, history, vi, 23, nevertheless, it, is, usually, considered, today, that, arachosia, and, the, other, three, regions, did, become, dominions, of, the, mauryan, empire, the, alliance, between, chandragupta, and, seleucus, was, affirmed, with, a, marriage, epigamia, chandragupta, or, his, son, may, have, married, a, daughter, of, seleucus, or, perhaps, there, was, diplomatic, recognition, of, intermarriage, between, indians, and, greeks, as, well, an, indian, puranic, source, the, pratisarga, parva, of, the, bhavishya, purana, also, described, the, marriage, of, chandragupta, with, a, greek, yavana, princess, daughter, of, seleucus, suluva, in, indian, sources, in, addition, to, this, matrimonial, recognition, or, alliance, seleucus, dispatched, an, ambassador, megasthenes, to, the, mauryan, court, at, pataliputra, modern, patna, in, bihar, state, only, short, extracts, remain, of, megasthenes, description, of, the, journey, the, two, rulers, seem, to, have, been, on, very, good, terms, as, classical, sources, have, recorded, that, following, their, treaty, chandragupta, sent, various, presents, such, as, aphrodisiacs, to, seleucus, seleucus, obtained, knowledge, of, most, of, northern, india, as, explained, by, pliny, the, elder, through, his, numerous, embassies, to, the, mauryan, empire, the, other, parts, of, the, country, beyond, the, hydaspes, the, farthest, extent, of, alexander, s, conquests, were, discovered, and, surveyed, by, seleucus, nicator, namely, seleucus, apparently, minted, coins, during, his, stay, in, india, as, several, coins, in, his, name, are, in, the, indian, standard, and, have, been, excavated, in, india, these, coins, describe, him, as, basileus, king, which, implies, a, date, later, than, 306, bc, some, of, them, also, mention, seleucus, in, association, with, his, son, antiochus, as, king, which, would, also, imply, a, date, as, late, as, 293, bc, no, seleucid, coins, were, struck, in, india, thereafter, and, confirm, the, reversal, of, territory, west, of, the, indus, to, chandragupta, seleucus, may, have, founded, a, navy, in, the, persian, gulf, and, in, the, indian, ocean, the, war, elephants, seleucus, received, from, chandragupta, proved, to, be, useful, when, the, diadochi, finally, decided, to, deal, with, antigonus, cassander, seleucus, and, lysimachus, defeated, antigonus, and, demetrius, in, the, battle, of, ipsus, antigonus, fell, in, battle, but, demetrius, escaped, after, the, battle, syria, was, placed, under, seleucus, rule, he, understood, syria, to, encompass, the, region, from, the, taurus, mountains, to, sinai, but, ptolemy, had, already, conquered, palestine, and, phoenicia, in, 299, bc, seleucus, allied, with, demetrius, and, married, his, daughter, stratonice, stratonice, was, also, the, daughter, of, antipater, s, daughter, phila, seleucus, had, a, daughter, by, stratonice, who, was, also, called, phila, the, fleet, of, demetrius, destroyed, ptolemy, s, fleet, and, thus, seleucus, did, not, need, to, fight, him, seleucus, however, did, not, manage, to, enlarge, his, kingdom, to, the, west, the, main, reason, was, that, he, did, not, have, enough, greek, troops, during, the, battle, of, ipsus, he, had, less, infantry, than, lysimachus, his, strength, was, in, his, war, elephants, and, in, traditional, persian, cavalry, in, order, to, enlarge, his, army, seleucus, tried, to, attract, colonists, from, mainland, greece, by, founding, four, new, cities, seleucia, pieria, and, laodicea, in, syria, on, the, coast, and, antioch, on, the, orontes, and, apameia, in, the, orontes, river, valley, antioch, became, his, chief, seat, of, government, the, new, seleucia, was, supposed, to, become, his, new, naval, base, and, a, gateway, to, the, mediterranean, seleucus, also, founded, six, smaller, cities, it, is, said, of, seleucus, that, few, princes, have, ever, lived, with, so, great, a, passion, for, the, building, of, cities, he, is, reputed, to, have, built, in, all, nine, seleucias, sixteen, antiochs, and, six, laodiceas, seleucus, nominated, his, son, antiochus, i, as, his, co, ruler, and, viceroy, of, the, eastern, provinces, in, 292, bc, the, vast, extent, of, the, empire, seeming, to, require, a, double, government, in, 294, bc, stratonice, married, her, stepson, antiochus, seleucus, reportedly, instigated, the, marriage, after, discovering, that, his, son, was, in, danger, of, dying, of, love, sickness, seleucus, was, thus, able, to, get, stratonice, out, of, the, way, as, her, father, demetrius, had, now, become, king, of, macedonia, the, alliance, between, seleucus, and, demetrius, ended, in, 294, bc, when, seleucus, conquered, cilicia, demetrius, invaded, and, easily, conquered, cilicia, in, 286, bc, which, meant, that, demetrius, was, now, threatening, the, most, important, regions, of, seleucus, empire, in, syria, demetrius, troops, however, were, tired, and, had, not, received, their, payment, seleucus, on, the, other, hand, was, known, as, a, cunning, and, rich, leader, who, had, earned, the, adoration, of, his, soldiers, seleucus, blocked, the, roads, leading, south, from, cilicia, and, urged, demetrius, troops, to, join, his, side, simultaneously, he, tried, to, evade, battle, with, demetrius, finally, seleucus, addressed, demetrius, personally, he, showed, himself, in, front, of, the, soldiers, and, removed, his, helmet, revealing, his, identity, demetrius, troops, now, started, to, abandon, their, leader, en, masse, demetrius, was, finally, imprisoned, in, apameia, and, died, a, few, years, later, in, captivity, lysimachus, and, ptolemy, had, supported, seleucus, against, demetrius, but, after, the, latter, s, defeat, the, alliance, started, to, break, apart, lysimachus, ruled, macedonia, thracia, and, asia, minor, he, also, had, problems, with, his, family, lysimachus, executed, his, son, agathocles, whose, wife, lysandra, escaped, to, babylon, to, seleucus, the, unpopularity, of, lysimachus, after, the, murder, of, agathocles, gave, seleucus, an, opportunity, to, remove, his, last, rival, his, intervention, in, the, west, was, solicited, by, ptolemy, keraunos, who, on, the, accession, to, the, egyptian, throne, of, his, brother, ptolemy, ii, 285, bc, had, at, first, taken, refuge, with, lysimachus, and, then, with, seleucus, seleucus, then, invaded, asia, minor, and, defeated, his, rival, in, the, battle, of, corupedium, in, lydia, 281, bc, lysimachus, fell, in, battle, in, addition, ptolemy, had, died, a, few, years, earlier, seleucus, was, thus, now, the, only, living, contemporary, of, alexander, before, his, death, seleucus, tried, to, deal, with, the, administration, of, asia, minor, the, region, was, ethnically, diverse, consisting, of, greek, cities, a, persian, aristocracy, and, indigenous, peoples, seleucus, perhaps, tried, to, defeat, cappadocia, but, failed, lysimachus, old, officer, philetairos, ruled, pergamon, independently, on, the, other, hand, based, on, their, names, seleucus, apparently, founded, a, number, of, new, cities, in, asia, minor, few, of, the, letters, seleucus, sent, to, different, cities, and, temples, still, exist, all, cities, in, asia, minor, sent, embassies, to, their, new, ruler, it, is, reported, that, seleucus, complained, about, the, number, of, letters, he, received, and, was, forced, to, read, he, was, apparently, a, popular, ruler, in, lemnos, he, was, celebrated, as, a, liberator, and, a, temple, was, built, to, honour, him, according, to, a, local, custom, seleucus, was, always, offered, an, extra, cup, of, wine, during, dinner, time, his, title, during, this, period, was, seleucus, soter, saviour, when, seleucus, left, for, europe, the, organizational, rearrangement, of, asia, minor, had, not, been, completed, seleucus, now, held, the, whole, of, alexander, s, conquests, except, egypt, and, moved, to, take, possession, of, macedonia, and, thrace, he, intended, to, leave, asia, to, antiochus, and, content, himself, for, the, remainder, of, his, days, with, the, macedonian, kingdom, in, its, old, limits, he, had, however, hardly, crossed, into, the, thracian, chersonese, when, he, was, assassinated, by, ptolemy, keraunos, near, lysimachia, in, september, 281, bc, it, appears, certain, that, after, taking, macedonia, and, thracia, seleucus, would, have, tried, to, conquer, greece, he, had, already, prepared, this, campaign, using, the, numerous, gifts, presented, to, him, he, was, also, nominated, an, honorary, citizen, of, athens, antiochus, founded, the, cult, of, his, father, a, cult, of, personality, formed, around, the, later, members, of, the, seleucid, dynasty, and, seleucus, was, later, worshipped, as, a, son, of, zeus, nikator, one, inscription, found, in, ilium, troy, advises, priests, to, sacrifice, to, apollo, the, ancestor, of, antiochus, family, several, anecdotes, of, seleucus, life, became, popular, in, the, classical, world, seleucus, reputation, as, a, founder, of, cities, also, seems, to, have, persisted, after, his, death, excavations, at, the, site, of, dura, europos, in, syria, for, instance, uncovered, a, cult, relief, from, a, temple, showing, seleucus, as, the, founder, of, the, city, crowning, the, gad, of, dura, clearer, evidence, that, the, city, considered, seleucus, to, be, its, founder, come, from, a, fragmentary, papyrus, document, p, dura, 32, which, designates, dura, europos, as, the, colony, of, the, europeans, of, seleucs, nicator, the, sparse, archaeological, remains, from, the, hellenistic, period, of, the, site, however, indicate, that, the, site, began, life, as, a, small, garrison, settlement, a, phourion, on, royal, land, that, did, not, yet, have, the, status, of, a, polis, the, road, system, and, fortifications, only, seem, to, have, been, constructed, in, 150, ce, the, small, community, living, around, the, base, of, the, citadel, with, small, plots, of, land, for, each, soldier, in, the, surrounding, countryside, is, unlikely, to, have, had, much, royal, attention, in, this, early, period, but, the, legend, surrounding, seleucus, i, nicator, as, a, city, founder, seems, to, have, lead, later, inhabitants, to, attach, his, name, to, their, settlement, 2, satrap, at, partition, of, babylon, possibly,
