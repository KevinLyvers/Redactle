tutankhamun, or, tutankhamen, c, 1341, bc, c, 1323, bc, was, an, ancient, egyptian, pharaoh, who, ruled, c, 1332, 1323, bc, during, the, late, eighteenth, dynasty, of, ancient, egypt, born, tutankhaten, he, was, likely, a, son, of, akhenaten, thought, to, be, the, kv55, mummy, his, mother, was, identified, through, dna, testing, as, the, younger, lady, buried, in, kv35, she, was, a, full, sister, of, her, husband, tutankhamun, acceded, to, the, throne, around, the, age, of, nine, following, the, short, reigns, of, his, predecessors, smenkhkare, and, neferneferuaten, he, married, his, half, sister, ankhesenpaaten, who, was, probably, the, mother, of, his, two, infant, daughters, during, his, reign, he, restored, the, traditional, polytheistic, form, of, ancient, egyptian, religion, undoing, the, religious, shift, known, as, atenism, his, endowments, and, restorations, of, cults, were, recorded, on, the, restoration, stela, the, cult, of, the, god, amun, at, thebes, was, restored, to, prominence, and, the, royal, couple, changed, their, names, to, tutankhamun, and, ankhesenamun, replacing, the, aten, suffix, additionally, he, moved, the, royal, court, away, from, akhenaten, s, capital, amarna, and, back, to, memphis, he, reestablished, diplomatic, relations, with, the, mitanni, and, carried, out, military, campaigns, in, nubia, and, the, near, east, tutankhamun, was, one, of, few, kings, worshipped, as, a, deity, during, his, lifetime, the, young, king, likely, began, construction, of, a, royal, tomb, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, and, an, accompanying, mortuary, temple, but, both, were, unfinished, at, the, time, of, his, death, tutankhamun, died, unexpectedly, aged, about, 18, his, health, and, the, cause, of, his, death, have, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, in, 2012, it, was, suggested, he, died, from, a, combination, of, malaria, and, a, leg, fracture, with, his, royal, tomb, incomplete, he, was, instead, buried, in, a, small, non, royal, tomb, adapted, for, his, use, he, was, succeeded, by, his, vizier, ay, likely, an, old, man, when, he, became, king, ay, s, reign, was, short, being, succeeded, by, horemheb, tutankhamun, s, commander, in, chief, under, horemheb, the, restoration, of, the, traditional, ancient, egyptian, religion, was, completed, ay, and, tutankhamun, s, constructions, were, usurped, and, earlier, amarna, period, rulers, were, erased, in, modern, times, tutankhamun, is, known, for, the, 1922, discovery, of, his, tomb, kv62, by, a, team, led, by, british, egyptologist, howard, carter, sponsored, by, british, aristocrat, george, herbert, although, robbed, anciently, it, retained, much, of, its, original, contents, including, the, king, s, undisturbed, mummy, the, discovery, received, worldwide, press, coverage, with, over, 5, 000, artifacts, it, gave, rise, to, renewed, public, interest, in, ancient, egypt, for, which, tutankhamun, s, mask, now, preserved, at, the, egyptian, museum, remains, a, popular, symbol, some, of, his, treasure, has, traveled, worldwide, with, unprecedented, response, the, egyptian, government, allowed, tours, beginning, in, 1961, the, deaths, of, some, individuals, who, were, involved, in, the, excavation, have, been, popularly, attributed, to, the, curse, of, the, pharaohs, due, to, the, similarity, of, their, circumstances, since, the, discovery, of, his, tomb, he, has, been, referred, to, colloquially, as, king, tut, tutankhamun, was, born, in, the, reign, of, akhenaten, during, the, amarna, period, of, the, late, eighteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, his, original, name, was, tutankhaten, or, tutankhuaten, meaning, living, image, of, aten, reflecting, the, shift, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, known, as, atenism, which, characterized, akhenaten, s, reign, his, parentage, is, debated, as, they, are, not, attested, in, surviving, inscriptions, he, was, certainly, a, prince, as, a, fragmentary, inscription, from, hermopolis, refers, to, tutankhuaten, as, a, king, s, son, he, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, the, son, of, akhenaten, or, his, successor, smenkhkare, inscriptions, from, tutankhamun, s, reign, treat, him, as, a, son, of, akhenaten, s, father, amenhotep, iii, but, that, is, only, possible, if, akhenaten, s, 17, year, reign, included, a, long, co, regency, with, his, father, a, possibility, that, many, egyptologists, once, supported, but, is, now, being, abandoned, his, mother, has, been, variously, suggested, to, be, akhenaten, s, chief, wife, nefertiti, or, akhenaten, s, daughters, meritaten, or, meketaten, tutankhamun, was, wet, nursed, by, a, woman, named, maia, known, from, her, tomb, at, saqqara, dna, testing, identified, his, father, as, the, mummy, from, tomb, kv55, thought, to, be, akhenaten, and, his, mother, as, the, younger, lady, an, anonymous, mummy, cached, in, tomb, kv35, his, parents, were, full, siblings, both, being, children, of, amenhotep, iii, and, his, chief, wife, tiye, the, identity, of, the, younger, lady, is, unknown, but, she, cannot, be, nefertiti, as, she, was, not, known, to, be, a, sister, of, akhenaten, however, researchers, such, as, marc, gabolde, and, aidan, dodson, claim, that, nefertiti, was, indeed, tutankhamun, s, mother, in, this, interpretation, of, the, dna, results, the, genetic, closeness, is, not, due, to, a, brother, sister, pairing, but, the, result, of, three, generations, of, first, cousin, marriage, making, nefertiti, a, first, cousin, of, akhenaten, the, validity, and, reliability, of, the, genetic, data, from, mummified, remains, has, been, questioned, due, to, possible, degradation, due, to, decay, when, tutankhaten, became, king, he, married, ankhesenpaaten, one, of, akhenaten, s, daughters, who, later, changed, her, name, to, ankhesenamun, he, fathered, two, daughters, who, died, at, or, soon, after, birth, and, were, buried, with, him, in, his, tomb, computed, tomography, studies, published, in, 2011, revealed, that, one, daughter, was, born, prematurely, at, 5, 6, months, of, pregnancy, and, the, other, at, full, term, 9, months, dna, testing, has, suggested, the, anonymous, mummy, kv21a, is, their, mother, but, the, data, is, not, statistically, significant, enough, to, allow, her, to, be, securely, identified, as, his, only, known, wife, ankhesenamun, tutankhamun, s, death, marked, the, end, of, the, royal, bloodline, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, a, genetic, study, published, in, 2020, revealed, tutankhamun, had, the, haplogroups, ydna, r1b, which, originated, in, western, asia, and, which, today, makes, up, 50, 60, of, the, genetic, pool, of, modern, europeans, and, mtdna, k, which, originated, in, the, near, east, he, shares, this, y, haplogroup, with, his, father, the, kv55, mummy, akhenaten, and, grandfather, amenhotep, iii, and, his, mtdna, haplogroup, with, his, mother, the, younger, lady, his, grandmother, tiye, and, his, great, grandmother, thuya, the, profiles, for, tutankhamun, and, amenhotep, iii, were, incomplete, and, the, analysis, produced, differing, probability, figures, despite, having, concordant, allele, results, because, the, relationships, of, these, two, mummies, with, the, kv55, mummy, had, previously, been, confirmed, in, an, earlier, study, the, haplogroup, prediction, of, both, mummies, could, be, derived, from, the, full, profile, of, the, kv55, data, in, 2022, s, o, y, keita, analysed, 8, short, tandem, loci, str, data, originally, published, by, hawass, et, al, in, studies, from, 2010, and, 2012, the, first, of, these, studies, had, investigated, familial, relationships, among, 11, royal, mummies, of, the, new, kingdom, which, included, tutankhamun, and, amenhotep, iii, as, well, as, potential, inherited, disorders, and, infectious, diseases, the, second, of, these, studies, described, above, had, investigated, the, y, haplogroups, and, genetic, kinship, of, ramesses, iii, and, an, unknown, man, buried, along, with, him, in, the, royal, cache, at, deir, el, bahari, keita, analysed, the, str, data, from, these, studies, using, an, algorithm, that, only, has, three, choices, eurasians, sub, saharan, africans, and, east, asians, using, these, three, options, keita, concluded, that, the, majority, of, the, samples, had, a, population, affinity, with, sub, saharan, africans, in, one, affinity, analysis, however, keita, cautioned, that, this, does, not, mean, that, the, royal, mummies, lacked, other, affiliations, which, he, argued, had, been, obscured, in, typological, thinking, keita, further, added, that, different, data, and, algorithms, might, give, different, results, reflecting, the, complexity, of, biological, heritage, and, the, associated, interpretation, tutankhamun, became, pharaoh, between, eight, and, nine, years, of, age, following, the, short, reigns, of, akhenaten, s, successors, smenkhkare, and, neferneferuaten, it, is, uncertain, whether, smenkhkare, s, reign, outlasted, akhenaten, s, the, female, ruler, neferneferuaten, is, now, thought, to, have, become, co, regent, shortly, before, akhenaten, s, death, and, to, have, reigned, for, some, time, after, it, on, acceding, the, throne, tutankhamun, took, the, throne, name, nebkheperure, he, reigned, for, about, nine, years, during, tutankhamun, s, reign, the, position, of, vizier, was, split, between, upper, and, lower, egypt, the, principal, vizier, for, upper, egypt, was, usermontu, another, figure, named, pentju, was, also, vizier, but, it, is, unclear, of, which, lands, it, is, not, entirely, known, if, ay, tutankhamun, s, successor, actually, held, this, position, a, gold, foil, fragment, from, kv58, seems, to, indicate, but, not, certainly, that, ay, was, referred, to, as, a, priest, of, maat, along, with, an, epithet, of, vizier, doer, of, maat, the, epithet, does, not, fit, the, usual, description, used, by, the, regular, vizier, but, might, indicate, an, informal, title, it, might, be, that, ay, used, the, title, of, vizier, in, an, unprecedented, manner, an, egyptian, priest, named, manetho, wrote, a, comprehensive, history, of, ancient, egypt, where, he, refers, to, a, king, named, orus, who, ruled, for, 36, years, and, had, a, daughter, named, acencheres, who, reigned, twelve, years, and, her, brother, rathotis, who, ruled, for, only, nine, years, the, amarna, rulers, are, central, in, the, list, but, which, name, corresponds, with, which, historic, figure, is, not, agreed, upon, by, researchers, orus, and, acencheres, have, been, identified, with, horemheb, and, akhenaten, and, rathotis, with, tutankhamun, the, names, are, also, associated, with, smenkhkare, amenhotep, iii, ay, and, the, others, in, differing, order, in, order, for, the, pharaoh, who, held, divine, office, to, be, linked, to, the, people, and, the, gods, special, epithets, were, created, for, them, at, their, accession, to, the, throne, the, ancient, egyptian, titulary, also, served, to, demonstrate, one, s, qualities, and, link, them, to, the, terrestrial, realm, the, five, names, were, developed, over, the, centuries, beginning, with, the, horus, name, tutankhamun, s, original, nomen, tutankhaten, did, not, have, a, nebty, name, or, a, gold, falcon, name, associated, with, it, as, nothing, has, been, found, with, the, full, five, name, protocol, at, the, beginning, of, tutankhaten, s, reign, the, royal, court, was, still, located, at, amarna, and, evidence, from, his, tomb, shows, that, the, aten, was, still, acknowledged, but, several, pieces, of, evidence, suggest, that, his, court, was, trying, to, reconcile, atenism, with, the, traditional, religion, and, activity, at, amarna, decreased, during, the, first, four, years, of, his, reign, these, years, saw, dramatic, reversals, of, akhenaten, s, policies, which, given, the, king, s, young, age, must, have, been, instigated, by, his, advisors, in, the, third, year, of, tutankhaten, s, reign, his, name, was, changed, to, tutankhamun, and, that, of, his, queen, to, akhesenamun, the, restoration, stela, which, probably, dates, to, year, 4, of, tutankhamun, s, reign, characterizes, the, amarna, period, as, a, time, of, disaster, saying, temples, and, the, estates, of, the, gods, and, goddesses, from, elephantine, to, the, marshes, of, the, delta, had, fallen, into, ruin, if, you, asked, a, god, for, advice, he, would, not, attend, and, if, one, spoke, to, a, goddess, likewise, she, would, not, attend, the, stela, proclaims, the, rebuilding, of, the, traditional, cults, priests, and, other, members, of, temple, staffs, were, restored, to, their, former, positions, around, this, time, the, royal, court, abandoned, amarna, memphis, became, the, main, seat, of, royal, administration, continuing, a, trend, that, dated, back, to, akhenaten, s, predecessors, toward, administering, the, country, from, that, central, location, rather, than, the, more, outlying, site, of, thebes, with, amun, restored, as, egypt, s, preeminent, deity, thebes, once, again, became, its, greatest, center, of, religious, activity, tutankhamun, enriched, and, endowed, the, priestly, orders, of, two, important, cults, initiated, a, restoration, process, for, old, monuments, that, were, damaged, during, the, amarna, period, and, reburied, his, father, s, remains, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, given, his, age, the, king, probably, had, advisers, which, presumably, included, ay, who, succeeded, tutankhamun, and, general, horemheb, ay, s, possible, son, in, law, and, successor, horemheb, records, that, the, king, appointed, him, lord, of, the, land, as, hereditary, prince, to, maintain, law, he, also, noted, his, ability, to, calm, the, young, king, when, his, temper, flared, in, his, third, regnal, year, tutankhamun, reversed, several, changes, made, during, his, father, s, reign, he, ended, the, worship, of, the, god, aten, and, restored, the, god, amun, to, supremacy, the, ban, on, the, cult, of, amun, was, lifted, and, traditional, privileges, were, restored, to, its, priesthood, the, capital, was, moved, back, to, thebes, and, the, city, of, akhetaten, was, abandoned, as, part, of, the, restoration, of, the, traditional, cults, the, king, initiated, building, projects, in, particular, at, karnak, in, thebes, where, he, laid, out, the, sphinx, avenue, leading, to, the, temple, of, mut, the, sphinxes, were, originally, made, for, akhenaten, and, nefertiti, they, were, given, new, ram, heads, and, small, statues, of, the, king, at, luxor, temple, he, completed, the, decoration, of, the, entrance, colonnade, of, amenhotep, iii, tutankhamun, made, several, endowments, that, enriched, and, added, to, the, priestly, numbers, of, the, cults, of, amun, and, ptah, he, commissioned, new, statues, of, the, deities, from, the, best, metals, and, stone, and, had, new, processional, barques, made, of, the, finest, cedar, from, lebanon, and, had, them, embellished, with, gold, and, silver, a, building, called, the, temple, of, nebkheperure, beloved, of, amun, who, puts, thebes, in, order, which, may, be, identical, to, a, building, called, temple, of, nebkheperre, in, thebes, a, possible, mortuary, temple, used, recycled, talatat, from, akhenaten, s, east, karnak, aten, temples, indicating, that, the, dismantling, of, these, temples, was, already, underway, many, of, tutankhamun, s, construction, projects, were, uncompleted, at, the, time, of, his, death, and, were, completed, by, or, usurped, by, his, successors, especially, horemheb, the, sphinx, avenue, was, completed, by, his, successor, ay, and, the, whole, was, usurped, by, horemheb, the, restoration, stele, was, usurped, by, horemheb, pieces, of, the, temple, of, nebkheperure, in, thebes, were, recycled, into, horemheb, s, own, building, projects, in, ancient, egypt, pharaohs, were, venerated, after, their, deaths, through, mortuary, cults, and, associated, temples, as, deities, this, form, of, apotheosis, was, relegated, to, deceased, pharaohs, but, tutankhamun, was, one, of, the, few, pharaohs, who, was, worshiped, in, this, manner, during, his, lifetime, a, stela, discovered, at, karnak, and, dedicated, to, amun, ra, and, tutankhamun, indicates, that, the, king, could, be, appealed, to, in, his, deified, state, for, forgiveness, and, to, free, the, petitioner, from, an, ailment, caused, by, sin, temples, of, his, cult, were, built, as, far, away, as, in, kawa, and, faras, in, nubia, the, title, of, the, sister, of, the, viceroy, of, kush, included, a, reference, to, the, deified, king, indicative, of, the, universality, of, his, cult, the, country, was, economically, weak, and, in, turmoil, following, the, reign, of, akhenaten, diplomatic, relations, with, other, kingdoms, had, been, neglected, and, tutankhamun, sought, to, restore, them, in, particular, with, the, mitanni, evidence, of, his, success, is, suggested, by, the, gifts, from, various, countries, found, in, his, tomb, despite, his, efforts, for, improved, relations, battles, with, nubians, and, asiatics, were, recorded, in, his, mortuary, temple, at, thebes, both, victories, for, egypt, also, as, far, as, is, known, tutankhamun, s, military, reign, was, undefeated, and, is, one, of, several, other, undefeated, reigns, in, ancient, egypt, s, history, the, extent, to, which, tutankhamun, participated, in, battles, is, an, open, question, and, has, yet, to, reach, consensus, among, researchers, on, one, hand, his, tomb, contained, extensive, military, armament, such, as, bows, khopesh, swords, daggers, wristguards, maces, shields, and, a, club, suggesting, he, had, extensive, weaponry, training, some, imagery, while, likely, figurative, does, depict, tutankhamun, as, directly, participatory, in, warfare, such, as, the, graphic, battle, depictions, on, the, painted, treasure, chest, in, his, tomb, other, artifacts, such, as, the, nine, bows, footstool, walking, sticks, and, sandals, depicting, enemies, and, a, gold, leaf, picture, of, him, during, chariot, archery, against, enemies, also, suggest, that, he, was, actively, engaged, in, egypt, s, international, conflict, egyptologist, bob, brier, has, argued, leaning, towards, tutankhamun, being, an, actively, participating, warrior, in, his, later, years, on, the, other, hand, given, tutankhamun, s, youth, and, hypothesized, physical, disabilities, like, a, speculated, cane, handicap, some, historians, are, skeptical, that, he, participated, in, these, battles, yet, some, experts, such, as, sofia, aziz, and, other, researchers, have, taken, the, position, that, the, speculations, of, tutankhamun, s, physical, frailty, are, overestimated, arguing, that, mummy, damage, has, led, to, misdiagnosis, instead, they, argue, that, the, more, rigorous, scientific, view, is, that, he, was, physically, active, and, perhaps, militarily, participatory, egyptologist, charlotte, booth, states, that, tutankhamun, participated, in, at, least, two, battles, one, nubian, battle, and, one, asiatic, battle, nevertheless, noting, that, other, researchers, suggest, that, he, may, have, only, accompanied, the, army, to, the, battlefield, for, moral, support, as, opposed, to, actively, participating, details, about, tutankhamun, s, health, and, early, death, are, heavily, debated, the, most, recent, study, suggests, tutankhamun, had, bone, necrosis, and, a, possible, clubfoot, which, may, have, rendered, him, dependent, on, assistive, canes, this, theory, is, disputed, as, neither, the, canes, nor, his, sandals, show, the, kinds, of, the, wear, expected, he, also, had, other, health, issues, including, scoliosis, and, had, contracted, several, strains, of, malaria, he, likely, died, of, complications, from, a, broken, leg, possibly, compounded, by, malaria, tutankhamun, was, slight, of, build, and, roughly, 167, cm, 5, ft, 6, in, tall, ct, investigations, of, tutankhamun, s, skull, revealed, an, excellent, condition, of, his, dentition, he, had, large, front, incisors, and, an, overbite, characteristic, of, the, thutmosid, royal, line, to, which, he, belonged, analysis, of, the, clothing, found, in, his, tomb, particularly, the, dimensions, of, his, loincloths, and, belts, indicates, that, he, had, a, narrow, waist, and, rounded, hips, in, attempts, to, explain, both, his, unusual, depiction, in, art, and, his, early, death, it, has, been, theorised, that, tutankhamun, had, gynecomastia, marfan, syndrome, wilson, turner, x, linked, intellectual, disability, syndrome, fr, hlich, syndrome, adiposogenital, dystrophy, klinefelter, syndrome, androgen, insensitivity, syndrome, aromatase, excess, syndrome, in, conjunction, with, sagittal, craniosynostosis, syndrome, antley, bixler, syndrome, or, one, of, its, variants, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, he, had, inherited, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, in, a, bid, to, explain, the, religiosity, of, his, great, grandfather, thutmose, iv, and, father, akhenaten, and, their, early, deaths, however, caution, has, been, urged, in, this, diagnosis, in, january, 2005, tutankhamun, s, mummy, was, ct, scanned, the, results, showed, that, the, young, king, had, a, partially, cleft, hard, palate, and, possibly, a, mild, case, of, scoliosis, additionally, he, was, diagnosed, with, a, flat, right, foot, with, hypophalangism, while, his, left, foot, was, clubbed, and, had, bone, necrosis, of, the, second, and, third, metatarsals, freiberg, disease, or, k, hler, disease, ii, however, the, clubfoot, diagnosis, is, disputed, james, gamble, instead, suggests, that, the, position, is, a, result, of, tutankhamun, habitually, walking, on, the, outside, of, his, foot, due, to, the, pain, caused, by, k, hler, disease, ii, this, theory, has, been, refuted, by, members, of, hawass, team, the, condition, may, have, forced, tutankhamun, to, walk, with, the, use, of, a, cane, many, of, which, were, found, in, his, tomb, however, none, of, them, show, the, wear, expected, of, essential, aids, the, wear, on, his, sandals, where, present, is, also, even, on, both, feet, the, presence, of, such, a, number, of, sticks, is, not, unexpected, as, canes, were, a, symbol, of, status, in, ancient, egypt, genetic, testing, through, str, analysis, rejected, the, hypothesis, of, gynecomastia, and, craniosynostoses, e, g, antley, bixler, syndrome, or, marfan, syndrome, genetic, testing, for, stevor, ama1, or, msp1, genes, specific, for, plasmodium, falciparum, revealed, indications, of, malaria, tropica, in, 4, mummies, including, tutankhamun, s, this, is, currently, the, oldest, known, genetic, proof, of, the, ailment, the, team, discovered, dna, from, several, strains, of, the, parasite, indicating, that, he, was, repeatedly, infected, with, the, most, severe, strain, of, malaria, his, malaria, infections, may, have, caused, a, fatal, immune, response, in, the, body, or, triggered, circulatory, shock, the, ct, scan, also, showed, that, he, had, experienced, a, compound, left, leg, fracture, this, injury, being, the, result, of, modern, damage, was, ruled, out, based, on, the, ragged, edges, of, the, fracture, modern, damage, features, sharp, edges, embalming, substances, were, present, within, the, fracture, indicating, that, it, was, associated, with, an, open, wound, no, signs, of, healing, were, present, a, facial, reconstruction, of, tutankhamun, was, carried, out, in, 2005, by, the, egyptian, supreme, council, of, antiquities, and, national, geographic, three, separate, teams, egyptian, french, and, american, worked, separately, to, approximate, the, face, of, the, boy, king, while, the, egyptian, and, french, teams, knew, their, subject, was, tutankhamun, the, american, team, worked, blind, all, teams, produced, very, similar, results, but, it, was, that, of, the, french, team, that, was, ultimately, cast, in, silicone, stuart, tyson, smith, egyptologist, and, professor, of, anthropology, at, university, of, california, santa, barbara, in, 2008, expressed, criticism, of, the, forensic, reconstruction, in, a, journal, review, he, noted, that, tutankhamun, s, face, was, depicted, as, very, light, skinned, reflecting, a, bias, among, media, outlets, smith, further, added, that, egyptologists, have, been, strangely, reluctant, to, admit, that, the, ancient, egyptians, were, rather, dark, skinned, africans, especially, the, farther, south, one, goes, there, are, no, surviving, records, of, the, circumstances, of, tutankhamun, s, death, it, has, been, the, subject, of, considerable, debate, and, major, studies, hawass, and, his, team, postulate, that, his, death, was, likely, the, result, of, the, combination, of, his, multiple, weakening, disorders, a, leg, fracture, perhaps, as, the, result, of, a, fall, and, a, severe, malarial, infection, however, timmann, and, meyer, have, argued, that, sickle, cell, anemia, better, fits, the, pathologies, exhibited, by, the, king, a, suggestion, the, egyptian, team, has, called, interesting, and, plausible, murder, by, a, blow, to, the, head, was, theorised, as, a, result, of, the, 1968, x, ray, which, showed, two, bone, fragments, inside, the, skull, this, theory, was, disproved, by, further, analysis, of, the, x, rays, and, the, ct, scan, the, inter, cranial, bone, fragments, were, determined, to, be, the, result, of, the, modern, unwrapping, of, the, mummy, as, they, are, loose, and, not, adherent, to, the, embalming, resin, no, evidence, of, bone, thinning, or, calcified, membranes, which, could, be, indicative, of, a, fatal, blow, to, the, head, were, found, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, young, king, was, killed, in, a, chariot, accident, due, to, a, pattern, of, crushing, injuries, including, the, fact, that, the, front, part, of, his, chest, wall, and, ribs, are, missing, however, the, missing, ribs, are, unlikely, to, be, a, result, of, an, injury, sustained, at, the, time, of, death, photographs, taken, at, the, conclusion, of, carter, s, excavation, in, 1926, show, that, the, chest, wall, of, the, king, was, intact, still, wearing, a, beaded, collar, with, falcon, headed, terminals, the, absence, of, both, the, collar, and, chest, wall, was, noted, in, the, 1968, x, ray, and, further, confirmed, by, the, ct, scan, it, is, likely, that, the, front, part, of, his, chest, was, removed, by, robbers, during, the, theft, of, the, beaded, collar, the, intricate, beaded, skullcap, the, king, was, pictured, wearing, in, 1926, was, also, missing, by, 1968, since, the, two, children, of, tutankhamun, and, his, sister, wife, queen, ankhesenamun, were, both, stillborns, and, tutankhamun, was, the, last, of, the, royal, male, siblings, there, was, no, immediate, heir, apparent, to, assume, the, throne, as, ankhesenamun, s, husband, records, in, horemheb, s, tomb, state, that, tutankhamun, appointed, him, lord, of, the, land, as, iry, pat, heir, designate, which, is, essentially, the, designated, hereditary, prince, to, maintain, law, however, queen, ankhesenamun, preferred, to, not, marry, someone, of, lesser, status, than, royal, queen, status, horemheb, was, a, militaryman, of, peasant, birth, and, was, as, the, military, commander, in, chief, technically, a, servant, of, queen, ankhesenamun, the, vizier, ay, while, of, some, royal, blood, was, an, established, vizier, and, also, technically, a, servant, of, queen, ankhesenamun, ankhesenamun, s, spousal, preferences, ignited, a, series, of, disruption, in, the, fulfillment, of, king, tutankhamun, s, will, on, throne, heirship, seeking, to, resolve, her, spousal, dilemma, ankhesenamun, inadvertently, generated, a, predicament, involving, the, hittite, king, suppiluliuma, i, and, his, son, prince, zannanza, known, as, the, zannanza, affair, meanwhile, tutankhamun, s, vizier, maneuvered, in, the, midst, of, tutankhamun, s, death, to, intercept, the, throne, circumventing, horemheb, s, rightful, heirship, marrying, ankhesenamun, towards, the, onset, of, this, hittite, egyptian, negotiation, period, unbeknownst, to, hittites, the, fact, that, ay, is, depicted, presiding, over, tutankhamun, s, funeral, which, is, customary, for, the, successor, pharaoh, and, the, fact, that, horemheb, appears, to, have, been, absent, at, tutankhamun, s, funeral, aligns, with, this, the, pharaoh, ay, s, reign, was, abruptly, short, and, his, death, again, left, a, vacancy, in, the, throne, with, no, royal, bloodline, heir, because, ay, did, not, have, children, with, queen, ankhesenamun, toward, the, end, of, ay, s, reign, ay, named, his, son, military, generalissimo, nakhtmin, to, be, successor, to, the, throne, however, nakhtmin, never, became, pharaoh, because, he, died, before, he, could, ultimately, as, prescribed, by, the, will, of, tutankhamun, horemheb, succeeded, the, throne, as, pharaoh, after, ay, s, death, likely, marrying, ankhesenamun, the, marriage, was, brief, as, ankhesenamun, died, only, a, couple, years, into, horemheb, s, lengthy, reign, horemheb, never, had, any, children, with, ankhesenamun, and, with, her, death, the, royal, bloodline, of, tutankhamun, definitively, completely, came, to, a, halt, as, pharaoh, horemheb, saw, to, it, that, the, restoration, of, the, traditional, ancient, egyptian, religion, that, tutankhamun, was, previously, spearheading, was, completed, restabilizing, the, nation, notably, during, the, standard, damnatio, memoriae, process, that, each, new, egyptian, pharaoh, undertakes, horemheb, defaced, ay, s, tomb, but, left, tutankhamun, s, untouched, presumably, out, of, respect, in, due, course, horemheb, had, selected, then, civilian, military, officer, ramesses, i, as, heir, to, the, throne, who, already, had, a, grandson, ramesses, ii, who, would, then, go, on, to, found, the, ramesside, dynasty, and, become, the, greatest, pharaoh, of, ancient, egypt, this, initiated, a, new, royal, bloodline, that, replaced, the, royal, bloodline, that, ended, with, the, death, of, tutankhamun, tutankhamun, was, buried, in, a, tomb, that, was, unusually, small, considering, his, status, his, death, may, have, occurred, unexpectedly, before, the, completion, of, a, grander, royal, tomb, causing, his, mummy, to, be, buried, in, a, tomb, intended, for, someone, else, this, would, preserve, the, observance, of, the, customary, 70, days, between, death, and, burial, his, tomb, was, robbed, at, least, twice, in, antiquity, but, based, on, the, items, taken, including, perishable, oils, and, perfumes, and, the, evidence, of, restoration, of, the, tomb, after, the, intrusions, these, robberies, likely, took, place, within, several, months, at, most, of, the, initial, burial, the, location, of, the, tomb, was, lost, because, it, had, come, to, be, buried, by, debris, from, subsequent, tombs, and, workers, houses, were, built, over, the, tomb, entrance, the, concession, rights, for, excavating, the, valley, of, the, kings, was, held, by, theodore, davis, from, 1905, until, 1914, in, that, time, he, had, unearthed, ten, tombs, including, the, nearly, intact, but, non, royal, tomb, of, queen, tiye, s, parents, yuya, and, thuya, as, he, continued, working, there, in, the, later, years, he, uncovered, nothing, of, major, significance, davis, did, find, several, objects, in, kv58, referring, to, tutankhamun, which, included, knobs, and, handles, bearing, his, name, most, significantly, the, embalming, cache, of, the, king, kv54, he, believed, this, to, be, the, pharaoh, s, lost, tomb, and, published, his, findings, as, such, with, the, line, i, fear, the, valley, of, the, tombs, is, exhausted, in, 1907, howard, carter, was, invited, by, william, garstin, and, gaston, maspero, to, excavate, for, george, herbert, 5th, earl, of, carnarvon, in, the, valley, the, earl, of, carnarvon, and, carter, had, hoped, this, would, lead, to, their, gaining, the, concession, when, davis, gave, it, up, but, had, to, be, satisfied, with, excavations, in, different, parts, of, the, theban, necropolis, for, seven, more, years, after, a, systematic, search, beginning, in, 1915, carter, discovered, the, actual, tomb, of, tutankhamun, kv62, in, november, 1922, an, ancient, stroke, of, luck, allowed, the, tomb, to, survive, to, modern, times, the, tomb, s, entrance, was, buried, by, mounds, of, debris, from, the, cutting, of, kv9, over, 150, years, after, tutankhamun, s, burial, ancient, workmen, s, huts, were, also, built, on, the, site, this, area, remained, unexcavated, until, 1922, due, to, its, proximity, to, kv9, as, excavations, would, impede, tourist, access, to, that, tomb, carter, commenced, excavations, in, early, november, 1922, before, the, height, of, the, tourist, season, the, first, step, of, the, tomb, s, entrance, staircase, was, uncovered, on, 4, november, 1922, according, to, carter, s, account, the, workmen, discovered, the, step, while, digging, beneath, the, remains, of, the, huts, other, accounts, attribute, the, discovery, to, a, boy, digging, outside, the, assigned, work, area, by, february, 1923, the, antechamber, had, been, cleared, of, everything, but, two, sentinel, statues, a, day, and, time, were, selected, to, unseal, the, tomb, with, about, twenty, appointed, witnesses, that, included, lord, carnarvon, several, egyptian, officials, museum, representatives, and, the, staff, of, the, government, press, bureau, on, 17, february, 1923, at, just, after, two, o, clock, the, seal, was, broken, letters, published, in, 2022, of, correspondence, between, rex, engelbach, and, alan, gardiner, reveal, that, howard, carter, had, stolen, objects, from, the, tomb, such, as, a, whm, amulet, before, the, tomb, was, officially, opened, rex, engelbach, said, in, a, letter, to, gardiner, about, a, whm, amulet, gifted, to, gardiner, from, carter, that, the, whm, amulet, you, showed, me, has, been, undoubtedly, stolen, from, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, tutankhamun, s, tomb, is, the, only, royal, tomb, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, found, in, near, intact, condition, there, were, 5, 398, items, found, in, the, tomb, including, a, solid, gold, coffin, face, mask, thrones, archery, bows, trumpets, a, lotus, chalice, two, imiut, fetishes, gold, toe, stalls, furniture, food, wine, sandals, and, fresh, linen, underwear, howard, carter, took, 10, years, to, catalog, the, items, recent, analysis, suggests, a, dagger, recovered, from, the, tomb, had, an, iron, blade, made, from, a, meteorite, study, of, artifacts, of, the, time, including, other, artifacts, from, tutankhamun, s, tomb, could, provide, valuable, insights, into, metalworking, technologies, around, the, mediterranean, at, the, time, complete, study, of, the, iron, artefacts, from, the, tomb, besides, the, blade, of, a, richly, decorated, golden, dagger, small, iron, chisel, blades, set, into, wooden, handles, an, eye, of, horus, amulet, and, a, miniature, headrest, demonstrated, that, all, were, made, of, similar, material, only, in, 2022, a, complex, technological, and, material, study, of, the, tutankhamun, s, mask, was, published, many, of, tutankhamun, s, burial, goods, show, signs, of, being, adapted, for, his, use, after, being, originally, made, for, earlier, owners, probably, smenkhkare, or, neferneferuaten, or, both, on, 4, november, 2007, 85, years, to, the, day, after, carter, s, discovery, tutankhamun, s, mummy, was, placed, on, display, in, his, underground, tomb, at, luxor, when, the, linen, wrapped, mummy, was, removed, from, its, golden, sarcophagus, to, a, climate, controlled, glass, box, the, case, was, designed, to, prevent, the, heightened, rate, of, decomposition, caused, by, the, humidity, and, warmth, from, tourists, visiting, the, tomb, in, 2009, the, tomb, was, closed, for, restoration, by, the, ministry, of, antiquities, and, the, getty, conservation, institute, while, the, closure, was, originally, planned, for, five, years, to, restore, the, walls, affected, by, humidity, the, egyptian, revolution, of, 2011, set, the, project, back, the, tomb, re, opened, in, february, 2019, for, many, years, rumors, of, a, curse, of, the, pharaohs, probably, fueled, by, newspapers, seeking, sales, at, the, time, of, the, discovery, persisted, emphasizing, the, early, death, of, some, of, those, who, had, entered, the, tomb, the, most, prominent, was, george, herbert, 5th, earl, of, carnarvon, who, died, on, 5, april, 1923, five, months, after, the, discovery, of, the, first, step, leading, down, to, the, tomb, on, 4, november, 1922, the, cause, of, carnarvon, s, death, was, pneumonia, supervening, on, erysipelas, a, streptococcal, infection, of, the, skin, and, underlying, soft, tissue, the, earl, had, been, in, an, automobile, accident, in, 1901, making, him, very, unhealthy, and, frail, his, doctor, recommended, a, warmer, climate, so, in, 1903, the, carnarvons, traveled, to, egypt, where, the, earl, became, interested, in, egyptology, along, with, the, stresses, of, the, excavation, carnarvon, was, already, in, a, weakened, state, when, an, infection, led, to, pneumonia, a, study, showed, that, of, the, 58, people, who, were, present, when, the, tomb, and, sarcophagus, were, opened, only, eight, died, within, a, dozen, years, howard, carter, died, of, lymphoma, in, 1939, at, the, age, of, 64, the, last, survivors, included, lady, evelyn, herbert, lord, carnarvon, s, daughter, who, was, among, the, first, people, to, enter, the, tomb, after, its, discovery, in, november, 1922, who, lived, for, a, further, 57, years, and, died, in, 1980, and, american, archaeologist, j, o, kinnaman, who, died, in, 1961, 39, years, after, the, event, tutankhamun, s, fame, is, primarily, the, result, of, his, well, preserved, tomb, and, the, global, exhibitions, of, his, associated, artifacts, as, jon, manchip, white, writes, in, his, foreword, to, the, 1977, edition, of, carter, s, the, discovery, of, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, the, pharaoh, who, in, life, was, one, of, the, least, esteemed, of, egypt, s, pharaohs, has, become, in, death, the, most, renowned, the, discoveries, in, the, tomb, were,

alley, songs, the, most, popular, of, the, latter, was, old, king, tut, by, harry, von, tilzer, from, 1923, which, was, recorded, by, such, prominent, artists, of, the, time, as, jones, hare, and, sophie, tucker, king, tut, became, the, name, of, products, businesses, and, the, pet, dog, of, u, s, president, herbert, hoover, while, the, treasures, of, tutankhamun, exhibit, was, touring, the,

million, copies, in, 2023, an, extinct, whale, discovered, in, the, eocene, deposits, of, egypt, was, named, tutcetus, after, tutankhamun, due, to, the, small, size, and, immature, age, of, the, type,
