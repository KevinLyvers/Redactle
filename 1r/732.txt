titus, lucretius, carus, t, a, t, s, l, u, k, r, i, s, ty, t, s, loo, kree, sh, s, latin, c, 99, c, 55, bc, was, a, roman, poet, and, philosopher, his, only, known, work, is, the, philosophical, poem, de, rerum, natura, a, didactic, work, about, the, tenets, and, philosophy, of, epicureanism, which, usually, is, translated, into, english, as, on, the, nature, of, things, and, somewhat, less, often, as, on, the, nature, of, the, universe, very, little, is, known, about, lucretius, s, life, the, only, certainty, is, that, he, was, either, a, friend, or, client, of, gaius, memmius, to, whom, the, poem, was, addressed, and, dedicated, de, rerum, natura, was, a, considerable, influence, on, the, augustan, poets, particularly, virgil, in, his, aeneid, and, georgics, and, to, a, lesser, extent, on, the, eclogues, and, horace, the, work, was, almost, lost, during, the, middle, ages, but, was, rediscovered, in, 1417, in, a, monastery, in, germany, by, poggio, bracciolini, and, it, played, an, important, role, both, in, the, development, of, atomism, lucretius, was, an, important, influence, on, pierre, gassendi, and, the, efforts, of, various, figures, of, the, enlightenment, era, to, construct, a, new, christian, humanism, and, now, good, memmius, receptive, ears, and, keen, intelligence, detached, from, cares, i, pray, you, bring, to, true, philosophy, de, rerum, natura, tr, melville, 1, 50, if, i, must, speak, my, noble, memmius, as, nature, s, majesty, now, known, demands, de, rerum, natura, tr, melville, 5, 6, virtually, nothing, is, known, about, the, life, of, lucretius, and, there, is, insufficient, basis, for, a, confident, assertion, of, the, dates, of, lucretius, s, birth, or, death, in, other, sources, another, yet, briefer, note, is, found, in, the, chronicon, of, donatus, s, pupil, jerome, writing, four, centuries, after, lucretius, s, death, he, enters, under, the, 171st, olympiad, titus, lucretius, the, poet, is, born, if, jerome, is, accurate, about, lucretius, s, age, 43, when, lucretius, died, discussed, below, then, it, may, be, concluded, he, was, born, in, 99, or, 98, bc, less, specific, estimates, place, the, birth, of, lucretius, in, the, 90s, bc, and, his, death, in, the, 50s, bc, in, agreement, with, the, poem, s, many, allusions, to, the, tumultuous, state, of, political, affairs, in, rome, and, its, civil, strife, lucretius, probably, was, a, member, of, the, aristocratic, gens, lucretia, and, his, work, shows, an, intimate, knowledge, of, the, luxurious, lifestyle, in, rome, lucretius, s, love, of, the, countryside, invites, speculation, that, he, inhabited, family, owned, rural, estates, as, did, many, wealthy, roman, families, and, he, certainly, was, expensively, educated, with, a, mastery, of, latin, greek, literature, and, philosophy, a, brief, biographical, note, is, found, in, aelius, donatus, s, life, of, virgil, which, seems, to, be, derived, from, an, earlier, work, by, suetonius, the, note, reads, the, first, years, of, his, life, virgil, spent, in, cremona, until, the, assumption, of, his, toga, virilis, on, his, 17th, birthday, when, the, same, two, men, held, the, consulate, as, when, he, was, born, and, it, so, happened, that, on, the, very, same, day, lucretius, the, poet, passed, away, however, although, lucretius, certainly, lived, and, died, around, the, time, that, virgil, and, cicero, flourished, the, information, in, this, particular, testimony, is, internally, inconsistent, if, virgil, was, born, in, 70, bc, his, 17th, birthday, would, be, in, 53, the, two, consuls, of, 70, bc, pompey, and, crassus, stood, together, as, consuls, again, in, 55, not, 53, another, note, regarding, lucretius, s, biography, is, found, in, jerome, s, chronicon, where, he, contends, that, lucretius, was, driven, mad, by, a, love, potion, and, when, during, the, intervals, of, his, insanity, he, had, written, a, number, of, books, which, were, later, emended, by, cicero, he, killed, himself, by, his, own, hand, in, the, 44th, year, of, his, life, the, claim, that, he, was, driven, mad, by, a, love, potion, although, defended, by, such, scholars, as, reale, and, catan, is, often, dismissed, as, the, result, of, historical, confusion, or, anti, epicurean, bias, in, some, accounts, the, administration, of, the, toxic, aphrodisiac, is, attributed, to, his, wife, lucilia, regardless, jerome, s, image, of, lucretius, as, a, lovesick, mad, poet, continued, to, have, significant, influence, on, modern, scholarship, until, quite, recently, although, it, now, is, accepted, that, such, a, report, is, inaccurate, his, poem, de, rerum, natura, usually, translated, as, on, the, nature, of, things, or, on, the, nature, of, the, universe, transmits, the, ideas, of, epicureanism, which, includes, atomism, and, cosmology, lucretius, was, the, first, writer, known, to, introduce, roman, readers, to, epicurean, philosophy, the, poem, written, in, some, 7, 400, dactylic, hexameters, is, divided, into, six, untitled, books, and, explores, epicurean, physics, through, richly, poetic, language, and, metaphors, lucretius, presents, the, principles, of, atomism, the, nature, of, the, mind, and, soul, explanations, of, sensation, and, thought, the, development, of, the, world, and, its, phenomena, and, explains, a, variety, of, celestial, and, terrestrial, phenomena, the, universe, described, in, the, poem, operates, according, to, these, physical, principles, guided, by, fortuna, chance, and, not, the, divine, intervention, of, the, traditional, roman, deities, and, the, religious, explanations, of, the, natural, world, within, this, work, lucretius, makes, reference, to, the, cultural, and, technological, development, of, humans, in, his, use, of, available, materials, tools, and, weapons, through, prehistory, to, lucretius, s, own, time, he, specifies, the, earliest, weapons, as, hands, nails, and, teeth, these, were, followed, by, stones, branches, and, fire, once, humans, could, kindle, and, control, it, he, then, refers, to, tough, iron, and, copper, in, that, order, but, goes, on, to, say, that, copper, was, the, primary, means, of, tilling, the, soil, and, the, basis, of, weaponry, until, by, slow, degrees, the, iron, sword, became, predominant, it, still, was, in, his, day, and, the, bronze, sickle, fell, into, disrepute, as, iron, ploughs, were, introduced, he, had, earlier, envisaged, a, pre, technological, pre, literary, kind, of, human, whose, life, was, lived, in, the, fashion, of, wild, beasts, roaming, at, large, from, this, beginning, he, theorised, there, followed, the, development, in, turn, of, crude, huts, use, and, kindling, of, fire, clothing, language, family, and, city, states, he, believed, that, smelting, of, metal, and, perhaps, too, the, firing, of, pottery, was, discovered, by, accident, for, example, the, result, of, a, forest, fire, he, does, specify, however, that, the, use, of, copper, followed, the, use, of, stones, and, branches, and, preceded, the, use, of, iron, lucretius, seems, to, equate, copper, with, bronze, an, alloy, of, copper, and, tin, that, has, much, greater, resilience, than, copper, both, copper, and, bronze, were, superseded, by, iron, during, his, millennium, 1000, bc, to, 1, bc, he, may, have, considered, bronze, to, be, a, stronger, variety, of, copper, and, not, necessarily, a, wholly, individual, material, lucretius, is, believed, to, be, the, first, to, put, forward, a, theory, of, the, successive, uses, of, first, wood, and, stone, then, copper, and, bronze, and, finally, iron, although, his, theory, lay, dormant, for, many, centuries, it, was, revived, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, he, has, been, credited, with, originating, the, concept, of, the, three, age, system, that, was, formalised, from, 1834, by, c, j, thomsen, in, a, letter, by, cicero, to, his, brother, quintus, in, february, 54, bc, cicero, said, the, poems, of, lucretius, are, as, you, write, they, exhibit, many, flashes, of, genius, and, yet, show, great, mastership, in, the, work, of, another, author, in, late, republican, rome, virgil, writes, in, the, second, book, of, his, georgics, apparently, referring, to, lucretius, happy, is, he, who, has, discovered, the, causes, of, things, and, has, cast, beneath, his, feet, all, fears, unavoidable, fate, and, the, din, of, the, devouring, underworld, lucretius, was, an, early, thinker, in, what, grew, to, become, the, study, of, evolution, he, believed, that, nature, experiments, endlessly, across, the, aeons, and, the, organisms, that, adapt, best, to, their, environment, have, the, best, chance, of, surviving, living, organisms, survived, because, of, the, commensurate, relationship, between, their, strength, speed, or, intellect, and, the, external, dynamics, of, their, environment, prior, to, charles, darwin, s, 1859, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, the, natural, philosophy, of, lucretius, typified, one, of, the, foremost, non, teleological, and, mechanistic, accounts, of, the, creation, and, evolution, of, life, in, contrast, to, modern, thought, on, the, subject, he, did, not, believe, that, new, species, evolved, from, previously, existing, ones, lucretius, challenged, the, assumption, that, humans, are, necessarily, superior, to, animals, noting, that, mammalian, mothers, in, the, wild, recognize, and, nurture, their, offspring, as, do, human, mothers, despite, his, advocacy, of, empiricism, and, his, many, correct, conjectures, about, atomism, and, the, nature, of, the, physical, world, lucretius, concludes, his, first, book, stressing, the, absurdity, of, the, by, then, well, established, spherical, earth, theory, as, it, related, to, the, personally, favored, infinite, earth, hypothesis, which, did, not, make, reference, to, outer, bodies, while, epicurus, left, open, the, possibility, for, free, will, by, arguing, for, the, uncertainty, of, the, paths, of, atoms, lucretius, viewed, the, soul, or, mind, as, emerging, from, fortuitous, arrangements, of, distinct, particles
