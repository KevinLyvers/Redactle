william, shakespeare, c, 23, april, 1564, 23, april, 1616, was, an, english, playwright, poet, and, actor, he, is, widely, regarded, as, the, greatest, writer, in, the, english, language, and, the, world, s, pre, eminent, dramatist, he, is, often, called, england, s, national, poet, and, the, bard, of, avon, or, simply, the, bard, his, extant, works, including, collaborations, consist, of, some, 39, plays, 154, sonnets, three, long, narrative, poems, and, a, few, other, verses, some, of, uncertain, authorship, his, plays, have, been, translated, into, every, major, living, language, and, are, performed, more, often, than, those, of, any, other, playwright, shakespeare, remains, arguably, the, most, influential, writer, in, the, english, language, and, his, works, continue, to, be, studied, and, reinterpreted, shakespeare, was, born, and, raised, in, stratford, upon, avon, warwickshire, at, the, age, of, 18, he, married, anne, hathaway, with, whom, he, had, three, children, susanna, and, twins, hamnet, and, judith, sometime, between, 1585, and, 1592, he, began, a, successful, career, in, london, as, an, actor, writer, and, part, owner, sharer, of, a, playing, company, called, the, lord, chamberlain, s, men, later, known, as, the, king, s, men, after, the, ascension, of, king, james, vi, of, scotland, to, the, english, throne, at, age, 49, around, 1613, he, appears, to, have, retired, to, stratford, where, he, died, three, years, later, few, records, of, shakespeare, s, private, life, survive, this, has, stimulated, considerable, speculation, about, such, matters, as, his, physical, appearance, his, sexuality, his, religious, beliefs, and, even, certain, fringe, theories, as, to, whether, the, works, attributed, to, him, were, written, by, others, shakespeare, produced, most, of, his, known, works, between, 1589, and, 1613, his, early, plays, were, primarily, comedies, and, histories, and, are, regarded, as, some, of, the, best, works, produced, in, these, genres, he, then, wrote, mainly, tragedies, until, 1608, among, them, hamlet, othello, king, lear, and, macbeth, all, considered, to, be, among, the, finest, works, in, english, in, the, last, phase, of, his, life, he, wrote, tragicomedies, also, known, as, romances, such, as, the, winter, s, tale, and, the, tempest, and, collaborated, with, other, playwrights, many, of, shakespeare, s, plays, were, published, in, editions, of, varying, quality, and, accuracy, during, his, lifetime, however, in, 1623, john, heminges, and, henry, condell, two, fellow, actors, and, friends, of, shakespeare, s, published, a, more, definitive, text, known, as, the, first, folio, a, posthumous, collected, edition, of, shakespeare, s, dramatic, works, that, includes, 36, of, his, plays, its, preface, was, a, prescient, poem, by, ben, jonson, a, former, rival, of, shakespeare, who, hailed, shakespeare, with, the, now, famous, epithet, not, of, an, age, but, for, all, time, shakespeare, was, the, son, of, john, shakespeare, an, alderman, and, a, successful, glover, glove, maker, originally, from, snitterfield, in, warwickshire, and, mary, arden, the, daughter, of, an, affluent, landowning, family, he, was, born, in, stratford, upon, avon, where, he, was, baptised, on, 26, april, 1564, his, date, of, birth, is, unknown, but, is, traditionally, observed, on, 23, april, saint, george, s, day, this, date, which, can, be, traced, to, william, oldys, and, george, steevens, has, proved, appealing, to, biographers, because, shakespeare, died, on, the, same, date, in, 1616, he, was, the, third, of, eight, children, and, the, eldest, surviving, son, although, no, attendance, records, for, the, period, survive, most, biographers, agree, that, shakespeare, was, probably, educated, at, the, king, s, new, school, in, stratford, a, free, school, chartered, in, 1553, about, a, quarter, mile, 400, m, from, his, home, grammar, schools, varied, in, quality, during, the, elizabethan, era, but, grammar, school, curricula, were, largely, similar, the, basic, latin, text, was, standardised, by, royal, decree, and, the, school, would, have, provided, an, intensive, education, in, grammar, based, upon, latin, classical, authors, at, the, age, of, 18, shakespeare, married, 26, year, old, anne, hathaway, the, consistory, court, of, the, diocese, of, worcester, issued, a, marriage, licence, on, 27, november, 1582, the, next, day, two, of, hathaway, s, neighbours, posted, bonds, guaranteeing, that, no, lawful, claims, impeded, the, marriage, the, ceremony, may, have, been, arranged, in, some, haste, since, the, worcester, chancellor, allowed, the, marriage, banns, to, be, read, once, instead, of, the, usual, three, times, and, six, months, after, the, marriage, anne, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, susanna, baptised, 26, may, 1583, twins, son, hamnet, and, daughter, judith, followed, almost, two, years, later, and, were, baptised, 2, february, 1585, hamnet, died, of, unknown, causes, at, the, age, of, 11, and, was, buried, 11, august, 1596, after, the, birth, of, the, twins, shakespeare, left, few, historical, traces, until, he, is, mentioned, as, part, of, the, london, theatre, scene, in, 1592, the, exception, is, the, appearance, of, his, name, in, the, complaints, bill, of, a, law, case, before, the, queen, s, bench, court, at, westminster, dated, michaelmas, term, 1588, and, 9, october, 1589, scholars, refer, to, the, years, between, 1585, and, 1592, as, shakespeare, s, lost, years, biographers, attempting, to, account, for, this, period, have, reported, many, apocryphal, stories, nicholas, rowe, shakespeare, s, first, biographer, recounted, a, stratford, legend, that, shakespeare, fled, the, town, for, london, to, escape, prosecution, for, deer, poaching, in, the, estate, of, local, squire, thomas, lucy, shakespeare, is, also, supposed, to, have, taken, his, revenge, on, lucy, by, writing, a, scurrilous, ballad, about, him, another, 18th, century, story, has, shakespeare, starting, his, theatrical, career, minding, the, horses, of, theatre, patrons, in, london, john, aubrey, reported, that, shakespeare, had, been, a, country, schoolmaster, some, 20th, century, scholars, suggested, that, shakespeare, may, have, been, employed, as, a, schoolmaster, by, alexander, hoghton, of, lancashire, a, catholic, landowner, who, named, a, certain, william, shakeshafte, in, his, will, little, evidence, substantiates, such, stories, other, than, hearsay, collected, after, his, death, and, shakeshafte, was, a, common, name, in, the, lancashire, area, it, is, not, known, definitively, when, shakespeare, began, writing, but, contemporary, allusions, and, records, of, performances, show, that, several, of, his, plays, were, on, the, london, stage, by, 1592, by, then, he, was, sufficiently, known, in, london, to, be, attacked, in, print, by, the, playwright, robert, greene, in, his, groats, worth, of, wit, from, that, year, there, is, an, upstart, crow, beautified, with, our, feathers, that, with, his, tiger, s, heart, wrapped, in, a, player, s, hide, supposes, he, is, as, well, able, to, bombast, out, a, blank, verse, as, the, best, of, you, and, being, an, absolute, johannes, factotum, is, in, his, own, conceit, the, only, shake, scene, in, a, country, scholars, differ, on, the, exact, meaning, of, greene, s, words, but, most, agree, that, greene, was, accusing, shakespeare, of, reaching, above, his, rank, in, trying, to, match, such, university, educated, writers, as, christopher, marlowe, thomas, nashe, and, greene, himself, the, so, called, university, wits, the, italicised, phrase, parodying, the, line, oh, tiger, s, heart, wrapped, in, a, woman, s, hide, from, shakespeare, s, henry, vi, part, 3, along, with, the, pun, shake, scene, clearly, identify, shakespeare, as, greene, s, target, as, used, here, johannes, factotum, jack, of, all, trades, refers, to, a, second, rate, tinkerer, with, the, work, of, others, rather, than, the, more, common, universal, genius, greene, s, attack, is, the, earliest, surviving, mention, of, shakespeare, s, work, in, the, theatre, biographers, suggest, that, his, career, may, have, begun, any, time, from, the, mid, 1580s, to, just, before, greene, s, remarks, after, 1594, shakespeare, s, plays, were, performed, at, the, theatre, in, shoreditch, only, by, the, lord, chamberlain, s, men, a, company, owned, by, a, group, of, players, including, shakespeare, that, soon, became, the, leading, playing, company, in, london, after, the, death, of, queen, elizabeth, in, 1603, the, company, was, awarded, a, royal, patent, by, the, new, king, james, i, and, changed, its, name, to, the, king, s, men, all, the, world, s, a, stage, and, all, the, men, and, women, merely, players, they, have, their, exits, and, their, entrances, and, one, man, in, his, time, plays, many, parts, as, you, like, it, act, ii, scene, 7, 139, 142, in, 1599, a, partnership, of, members, of, the, company, built, their, own, theatre, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, thames, which, they, named, the, globe, in, 1608, the, partnership, also, took, over, the, blackfriars, indoor, theatre, extant, records, of, shakespeare, s, property, purchases, and, investments, indicate, that, his, association, with, the, company, made, him, a, wealthy, man, and, in, 1597, he, bought, the, second, largest, house, in, stratford, new, place, and, in, 1605, invested, in, a, share, of, the, parish, tithes, in, stratford, some, of, shakespeare, s, plays, were, published, in, quarto, editions, beginning, in, 1594, and, by, 1598, his, name, had, become, a, selling, point, and, began, to, appear, on, the, title, pages, shakespeare, continued, to, act, in, his, own, and, other, plays, after, his, success, as, a, playwright, the, 1616, edition, of, ben, jonson, s, works, names, him, on, the, cast, lists, for, every, man, in, his, humour, 1598, and, sejanus, his, fall, 1603, the, absence, of, his, name, from, the, 1605, cast, list, for, jonson, s, volpone, is, taken, by, some, scholars, as, a, sign, that, his, acting, career, was, nearing, its, end, the, first, folio, of, 1623, however, lists, shakespeare, as, one, of, the, principal, actors, in, all, these, plays, some, of, which, were, first, staged, after, volpone, although, one, cannot, know, for, certain, which, roles, he, played, in, 1610, john, davies, of, hereford, wrote, that, good, will, played, kingly, roles, in, 1709, rowe, passed, down, a, tradition, that, shakespeare, played, the, ghost, of, hamlet, s, father, later, traditions, maintain, that, he, also, played, adam, in, as, you, like, it, and, the, chorus, in, henry, v, though, scholars, doubt, the, sources, of, that, information, throughout, his, career, shakespeare, divided, his, time, between, london, and, stratford, in, 1596, the, year, before, he, bought, new, place, as, his, family, home, in, stratford, shakespeare, was, living, in, the, parish, of, st, helen, s, bishopsgate, north, of, the, river, thames, he, moved, across, the, river, to, southwark, by, 1599, the, same, year, his, company, constructed, the, globe, theatre, there, by, 1604, he, had, moved, north, of, the, river, again, to, an, area, north, of, st, paul, s, cathedral, with, many, fine, houses, there, he, rented, rooms, from, a, french, huguenot, named, christopher, mountjoy, a, maker, of, women, s, wigs, and, other, headgear, nicholas, rowe, was, the, first, biographer, to, record, the, tradition, repeated, by, samuel, johnson, that, shakespeare, retired, to, stratford, some, years, before, his, death, he, was, still, working, as, an, actor, in, london, in, 1608, in, an, answer, to, the, sharers, petition, in, 1635, cuthbert, burbage, stated, that, after, purchasing, the, lease, of, the, blackfriars, theatre, in, 1608, from, henry, evans, the, king, s, men, placed, men, players, there, which, were, heminges, condell, shakespeare, etc, however, it, is, perhaps, relevant, that, the, bubonic, plague, raged, in, london, throughout, 1609, the, london, public, playhouses, were, repeatedly, closed, during, extended, outbreaks, of, the, plague, a, total, of, over, 60, months, closure, between, may, 1603, and, february, 1610, which, meant, there, was, often, no, acting, work, retirement, from, all, work, was, uncommon, at, that, time, shakespeare, continued, to, visit, london, during, the, years, 1611, 1614, in, 1612, he, was, called, as, a, witness, in, bellott, v, mountjoy, a, court, case, concerning, the, marriage, settlement, of, mountjoy, s, daughter, mary, in, march, 1613, he, bought, a, gatehouse, in, the, former, blackfriars, priory, and, from, november, 1614, he, was, in, london, for, several, weeks, with, his, son, in, law, john, hall, after, 1610, shakespeare, wrote, fewer, plays, and, none, are, attributed, to, him, after, 1613, his, last, three, plays, were, collaborations, probably, with, john, fletcher, who, succeeded, him, as, the, house, playwright, of, the, king, s, men, he, retired, in, 1613, before, the, globe, theatre, burned, down, during, the, performance, of, henry, viii, on, 29, june, shakespeare, died, on, 23, april, 1616, at, the, age, of, 52, he, died, within, a, month, of, signing, his, will, a, document, which, he, begins, by, describing, himself, as, being, in, perfect, health, no, extant, contemporary, source, explains, how, or, why, he, died, half, a, century, later, john, ward, the, vicar, of, stratford, wrote, in, his, notebook, shakespeare, drayton, and, ben, jonson, had, a, merry, meeting, and, it, seems, drank, too, hard, for, shakespeare, died, of, a, fever, there, contracted, not, an, impossible, scenario, since, shakespeare, knew, jonson, and, drayton, of, the, tributes, from, fellow, authors, one, refers, to, his, relatively, sudden, death, we, wondered, shakespeare, that, thou, went, st, so, soon, from, the, world, s, stage, to, the, grave, s, tiring, room, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, and, two, daughters, susanna, had, married, a, physician, john, hall, in, 1607, and, judith, had, married, thomas, quiney, a, vintner, two, months, before, shakespeare, s, death, shakespeare, signed, his, last, will, and, testament, on, 25, march, 1616, the, following, day, thomas, quiney, his, new, son, in, law, was, found, guilty, of, fathering, an, illegitimate, son, by, margaret, wheeler, both, of, whom, had, died, during, childbirth, thomas, was, ordered, by, the, church, court, to, do, public, penance, which, would, have, caused, much, shame, and, embarrassment, for, the, shakespeare, family, shakespeare, bequeathed, the, bulk, of, his, large, estate, to, his, elder, daughter, susanna, under, stipulations, that, she, pass, it, down, intact, to, the, first, son, of, her, body, the, quineys, had, three, children, all, of, whom, died, without, marrying, the, halls, had, one, child, elizabeth, who, married, twice, but, died, without, children, in, 1670, ending, shakespeare, s, direct, line, shakespeare, s, will, scarcely, mentions, his, wife, anne, who, was, probably, entitled, to, one, third, of, his, estate, automatically, he, did, make, a, point, however, of, leaving, her, my, second, best, bed, a, bequest, that, has, led, to, much, speculation, some, scholars, see, the, bequest, as, an, insult, to, anne, whereas, others, believe, that, the, second, best, bed, would, have, been, the, matrimonial, bed, and, therefore, rich, in, significance, shakespeare, was, buried, in, the, chancel, of, the, holy, trinity, church, two, days, after, his, death, the, epitaph, carved, into, the, stone, slab, covering, his, grave, includes, a, curse, against, moving, his, bones, which, was, carefully, avoided, during, restoration, of, the, church, in, 2008, good, frend, for, iesvs, sake, forbeare, to, digg, the, dvst, encloased, heare, bleste, be, y, man, y, spares,

he, that, moves, my, bones, some, time, before, 1623, a, funerary, monument, was, erected, in, his, memory, on, the, north, wall, with, a, half, effigy, of, him, in, the, act, of, writing, its, plaque, compares, him, to, nestor, socrates, and, virgil, in, 1623, in, conjunction, with, the, publication, of, the, first, folio, the, droeshout, engraving, was, published, shakespeare, has, been, commemorated, in, many, statues, and, memorials, around, the, world, including, funeral, monuments, in, southwark, cathedral, and, poets, corner, in, westminster, abbey, most, playwrights, of, the, period, typically, collaborated, with, others, at, some, point, as, critics, agree, shakespeare, did, mostly, early, and, late, in, his, career, the, first, recorded, works, of, shakespeare, are, richard, iii, and, the, three, parts, of, henry, vi, written, in, the, early, 1590s, during, a, vogue, for, historical, drama, shakespeare, s, plays, are, difficult, to, date, precisely, however, and, studies, of, the, texts, suggest, that, titus, andronicus, the, comedy, of, errors, the, taming, of, the, shrew, and, the, two, gentlemen, of, verona, may, also, belong, to, shakespeare, s, earliest, period, his, first, histories, which, draw, heavily, on, the, 1587, edition, of, raphael, holinshed, s, chronicles, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, dramatise, the, destructive, results, of, weak, or, corrupt, rule, and, have, been, interpreted, as, a, justification, for, the, origins, of, the, tudor, dynasty, the, early, plays, were, influenced, by, the, works, of, other, elizabethan, dramatists, especially, thomas, kyd, and, christopher, marlowe, by, the, traditions, of, medieval, drama, and, by, the, plays, of, seneca, the, comedy, of, errors, was, also, based, on, classical, models, but, no, source, for, the, taming, of, the, shrew, has, been, found, though, it, has, an, identical, plot, but, different, wording, as, another, play, with, a, similar, name, like, the, two, gentlemen, of, verona, in, which, two, friends, appear, to, approve, of, rape, the, shrew, s, story, of, the, taming, of, a, woman, s, independent, spirit, by, a, man, sometimes, troubles, modern, critics, directors, and, audiences, shakespeare, s, early, classical, and, italianate, comedies, containing, tight, double, plots, and, precise, comic, sequences, give, way, in, the, mid, 1590s, to, the, romantic, atmosphere, of, his, most, acclaimed, comedies, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, is, a, witty, mixture, of, romance, fairy, magic, and, comic, lowlife, scenes, shakespeare, s, next, comedy, the, equally, romantic, the, merchant, of, venice, contains, a, portrayal, of, the, vengeful, jewish, moneylender, shylock, which, reflects, dominant, elizabethan, views, but, may, appear, derogatory, to, modern, audiences, the, wit, and, wordplay, of, much, ado, about, nothing, the, charming, rural, setting, of, as, you, like, it, and, the, lively, merrymaking, of, twelfth, night, complete, shakespeare, s, sequence, of, great, comedies, after, the, lyrical, richard, ii, written, almost, entirely, in, verse, shakespeare, introduced, prose, comedy, into, the, histories, of, the, late, 1590s, henry, iv, part, 1, and, 2, and, henry, v, henry, iv, features, falstaff, rogue, wit, and, friend, of, prince, hal, his, characters, become, more, complex, and, tender, as, he, switches, deftly, between, comic, and, serious, scenes, prose, and, poetry, and, achieves, the, narrative, variety, of, his, mature, work, this, period, begins, and, ends, with, two, tragedies, romeo, and, juliet, the, famous, romantic, tragedy, of, sexually, charged, adolescence, love, and, death, and, julius, caesar, based, on, sir, thomas, north, s, 1579, translation, of, plutarch, s, parallel, lives, which, introduced, a, new, kind, of, drama, according, to, shakespearean, scholar, james, shapiro, in, julius, caesar, the, various, strands, of, politics, character, inwardness, contemporary, events, even, shakespeare, s, own, reflections, on, the, act, of, writing, began, to, infuse, each, other, in, the, early, 17th, century, shakespeare, wrote, the, so, called, problem, plays, measure, for, measure, troilus, and, cressida, and, all, s, well, that, ends, well, and, a, number, of, his, best, known, tragedies, many, critics, believe, that, shakespeare, s, tragedies, represent, the, peak, of, his, art, hamlet, has, probably, been, analysed, more, than, any, other, shakespearean, character, especially, for, his, famous, soliloquy, which, begins, to, be, or, not, to, be, that, is, the, question, unlike, the, introverted, hamlet, whose, fatal, flaw, is, hesitation, othello, and, lear, are, undone, by, hasty, errors, of, judgement, the, plots, of, shakespeare, s, tragedies, often, hinge, on, such, fatal, errors, or, flaws, which, overturn, order, and, destroy, the, hero, and, those, he, loves, in, othello, iago, stokes, othello, s, sexual, jealousy, to, the, point, where, he, murders, the, innocent, wife, who, loves, him, in, king, lear, the, old, king, commits, the, tragic, error, of, giving, up, his, powers, initiating, the, events, which, lead, to, the, torture, and, blinding, of, the, earl, of, gloucester, and, the, murder, of, lear, s, youngest, daughter, cordelia, according, to, the, critic, frank, kermode, the, play, offers, neither, its, good, characters, nor, its, audience, any, relief, from, its, cruelty, in, macbeth, the, shortest, and, most, compressed, of, shakespeare, s, tragedies, uncontrollable, ambition, incites, macbeth, and, his, wife, lady, macbeth, to, murder, the, rightful, king, and, usurp, the, throne, until, their, own, guilt, destroys, them, in, turn, in, this, play, shakespeare, adds, a, supernatural, element, to, the, tragic, structure, his, last, major, tragedies, antony, and, cleopatra, and, coriolanus, contain, some, of, shakespeare, s, finest, poetry, and, were, considered, his, most, successful, tragedies, by, the, poet, and, critic, t, s, eliot, eliot, wrote, shakespeare, acquired, more, essential, history, from, plutarch, than, most, men, could, from, the, whole, british, museum, in, his, final, period, shakespeare, turned, to, romance, or, tragicomedy, and, completed, three, more, major, plays, cymbeline, the, winter, s, tale, and, the, tempest, as, well, as, the, collaboration, pericles, prince, of, tyre, less, bleak, than, the, tragedies, these, four, plays, are, graver, in, tone, than, the, comedies, of, the, 1590s, but, they, end, with, reconciliation, and, the, forgiveness, of, potentially, tragic, errors, some, commentators, have, seen, this, change, in, mood, as, evidence, of, a, more, serene, view, of, life, on, shakespeare, s, part, but, it, may, merely, reflect, the, theatrical, fashion, of, the, day, shakespeare, collaborated, on, two, further, surviving, plays, henry, viii, and, the, two, noble, kinsmen, probably, with, john, fletcher, shakespeare, s, works, include, the, 36, plays, printed, in, the, first, folio, of, 1623, listed, according, to, their, folio, classification, as, comedies, histories, and, tragedies, two, plays, not, included, in, the, first, folio, the, two, noble, kinsmen, and, pericles, prince, of, tyre, are, now, accepted, as, part, of, the, canon, with, today, s, scholars, agreeing, that, shakespeare, made, major, contributions, to, the, writing, of, both, no, shakespearean, poems, were, included, in, the, first, folio, in, the, late, 19th, century, edward, dowden, classified, four, of, the, late, comedies, as, romances, and, though, many, scholars, prefer, to, call, them, tragicomedies, dowden, s, term, is, often, used, in, 1896, frederick, s, boas, coined, the, term, problem, plays, to, describe, four, plays, all, s, well, that, ends, well, measure, for, measure, troilus, and, cressida, and, hamlet, dramas, as, singular, in, theme, and, temper, cannot, be, strictly, called, comedies, or, tragedies, he, wrote, we, may, therefore, borrow, a, convenient, phrase, from, the, theatre, of, today, and, class, them, together, as, shakespeare, s, problem, plays, the, term, much, debated, and, sometimes, applied, to, other, plays, remains, in, use, though, hamlet, is, definitively, classed, as, a, tragedy, it, is, not, clear, for, which, companies, shakespeare, wrote, his, early, plays, the, title, page, of, the, 1594, edition, of, titus, andronicus, reveals, that, the, play, had, been, acted, by, three, different, troupes, after, the, plagues, of, 1592, 93, shakespeare, s, plays, were, performed, by, his, own, company, at, the, theatre, and, the, curtain, in, shoreditch, north, of, the, thames, londoners, flocked, there, to, see, the, first, part, of, henry, iv, leonard, digges, recording, let, but, falstaff, come, hal, poins, the, rest, and, you, scarce, shall, have, a, room, when, the, company, found, themselves, in, dispute, with, their, landlord, they, pulled, the, theatre, down, and, used, the, timbers, to, construct, the, globe, theatre, the, first, playhouse, built, by, actors, for, actors, on, the, south, bank, of, the, thames, at, southwark, the, globe, opened, in, autumn, 1599, with, julius, caesar, one, of, the, first, plays, staged, most, of, shakespeare, s, greatest, post, 1599, plays, were, written, for, the, globe, including, hamlet, othello, and, king, lear, after, the, lord, chamberlain, s, men, were, renamed, the, king, s, men, in, 1603, they, entered, a, special, relationship, with, the, new, king, james, although, the, performance, records, are, patchy, the, king, s, men, performed, seven, of, shakespeare, s, plays, at, court, between, 1, november, 1604, and, 31, october, 1605, including, two, performances, of, the, merchant, of, venice, after, 1608, they, performed, at, the, indoor, blackfriars, theatre, during, the, winter, and, the, globe, during, the, summer, the, indoor, setting, combined, with, the, jacobean, fashion, for, lavishly, staged, masques, allowed, shakespeare, to, introduce, more, elaborate, stage, devices, in, cymbeline, for, example, jupiter, descends, in, thunder, and, lightning, sitting, upon, an, eagle, he, throws, a, thunderbolt, the, ghosts, fall, on, their, knees, the, actors, in, shakespeare, s, company, included, the, famous, richard, burbage, william, kempe, henry, condell, and, john, heminges, burbage, played, the, leading, role, in, the, first, performances, of, many, of, shakespeare, s, plays, including, richard, iii, hamlet, othello, and, king, lear, the, popular, comic, actor, will, kempe, played, the, servant, peter, in, romeo, and, juliet, and, dogberry, in, much, ado, about, nothing, among, other, characters, he, was, replaced, around, 1600, by, robert, armin, who, played, roles, such, as, touchstone, in, as, you, like, it, and, the, fool, in, king, lear, in, 1613, sir, henry, wotton, recorded, that, henry, viii, was, set, forth, with, many, extraordinary, circumstances, of, pomp, and, ceremony, on, 29, june, however, a, cannon, set, fire, to, the, thatch, of, the, globe, and, burned, the, theatre, to, the, ground, an, event, which, pinpoints, the, date, of, a, shakespeare, play, with, rare, precision, in, 1623, john, heminges, and, henry, condell, two, of, shakespeare, s, friends, from, the, king, s, men, published, the, first, folio, a, collected, edition, of, shakespeare, s, plays, it, contained, 36, texts, including, 18, printed, for, the, first, time, the, others, had, already, appeared, in, quarto, versions, flimsy, books, made, from, sheets, of, paper, folded, twice, to, make, four, leaves, no, evidence, suggests, that, shakespeare, approved, these, editions, which, the, first, folio, describes, as, stol, n, and, surreptitious, copies, alfred, pollard, termed, some, of, the, pre, 1623, versions, as, bad, quartos, because, of, their, adapted, paraphrased, or, garbled, texts, which, may, in, places, have, been, reconstructed, from, memory, where, several, versions, of, a, play, survive, each, differs, from, the, others, the, differences, may, stem, from, copying, or, printing, errors, from, notes, by, actors, or, audience, members, or, from, shakespeare, s, own, papers, in, some, cases, for, example, hamlet, troilus, and, cressida, and, othello, shakespeare, could, have, revised, the, texts, between, the, quarto, and, folio, editions, in, the, case, of, king, lear, however, while, most, modern, editions, do, conflate, them, the, 1623, folio, version, is, so, different, from, the, 1608, quarto, that, the, oxford, shakespeare, prints, them, both, arguing, that, they, cannot, be, conflated, without, confusion, in, 1593, and, 1594, when, the, theatres, were, closed, because, of, plague, shakespeare, published, two, narrative, poems, on, sexual, themes, venus, and, adonis, and, the, rape, of, lucrece, he, dedicated, them, to, henry, wriothesley, earl, of, southampton, in, venus, and, adonis, an, innocent, adonis, rejects, the, sexual, advances, of, venus, while, in, the, rape, of, lucrece, the, virtuous, wife, lucrece, is, raped, by, the, lustful, tarquin, influenced, by, ovid, s, metamorphoses, the, poems, show, the, guilt, and, moral, confusion, that, result, from, uncontrolled, lust, both, proved, popular, and, were, often, reprinted, during, shakespeare, s, lifetime, a, third, narrative, poem, a, lover, s, complaint, in, which, a, young, woman, laments, her, seduction, by, a, persuasive, suitor, was, printed, in, the, first, edition, of, the, sonnets, in, 1609, most, scholars, now, accept, that, shakespeare, wrote, a, lover, s, complaint, critics, consider, that, its, fine, qualities, are, marred, by, leaden, effects, the, phoenix, and, the, turtle, printed, in, robert, chester, s, 1601, love, s, martyr, mourns, the, deaths, of, the, legendary, phoenix, and, his, lover, the, faithful, turtle, dove, in, 1599, two, early, drafts, of, sonnets, 138, and, 144, appeared, in, the, passionate, pilgrim, published, under, shakespeare, s, name, but, without, his, permission, published, in, 1609, the, sonnets, were, the, last, of, shakespeare, s, non, dramatic, works, to, be, printed, scholars, are, not, certain, when, each, of, the, 154, sonnets, was, composed, but, evidence, suggests, that, shakespeare, wrote, sonnets, throughout, his, career, for, a, private, readership, even, before, the, two, unauthorised, sonnets, appeared, in, the, passionate, pilgrim, in, 1599, francis, meres, had, referred, in, 1598, to, shakespeare, s, sugred, sonnets, among, his, private, friends, few, analysts, believe, that, the, published, collection, follows, shakespeare, s, intended, sequence, he, seems, to, have, planned, two, contrasting, series, one, about, uncontrollable, lust, for, a, married, woman, of, dark, complexion, the, dark, lady, and, one, about, conflicted, love, for, a, fair, young, man, the, fair, youth, it, remains, unclear, if, these, figures, represent, real, individuals, or, if, the, authorial, i, who, addresses, them, represents, shakespeare, himself, though, wordsworth, believed, that, with, the, sonnets, shakespeare, unlocked, his, heart, shall, i, compare, thee, to, a, summer, s, day, thou, art, more, lovely, and, more, temperate, opening, lines, from, shakespeare, s, sonnet, 18, the, 1609, edition, was, dedicated, to, a, mr, w, h, credited, as, the, only, begetter, of, the, poems, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, written, by, shakespeare, himself, or, by, the, publisher, thomas, thorpe, whose, initials, appear, at, the, foot, of, the, dedication, page, nor, is, it, known, who, mr, w, h, was, despite, numerous, theories, or, whether, shakespeare, even, authorised, the, publication, critics, praise, the, sonnets, as, a, profound, meditation, on, the, nature, of, love, sexual, passion, procreation, death, and, time, shakespeare, s, first, plays, were, written, in, the, conventional, style, of, the, day, he, wrote, them, in, a, stylised, language, that, does, not, always, spring, naturally, from, the, needs, of, the, characters, or, the, drama, the, poetry, depends, on, extended, sometimes, elaborate, metaphors, and, conceits, and, the, language, is, often, rhetorical, written, for, actors, to, declaim, rather, than, speak, the, grand, speeches, in, titus, andronicus, in, the, view, of, some, critics, often, hold, up, the, action, for, example, and, the, verse, in, the, two, gentlemen, of, verona, has, been, described, as, stilted, and, pity, like, a, naked, new, born, babe, striding, the, blast, or, heaven, s, cherubim, hors, d, upon, the, sightless, couriers, of, the, air, however, shakespeare, soon, began, to, adapt, the, traditional, styles, to, his, own, purposes, the, opening, soliloquy, of, richard, iii, has, its, roots, in, the, self, declaration, of, vice, in, medieval, drama, at, the, same, time, richard, s, vivid, self, awareness, looks, forward, to, the, soliloquies, of, shakespeare, s, mature, plays, no, single, play, marks, a, change, from, the, traditional, to, the, freer, style, shakespeare, combined, the, two, throughout, his, career, with, romeo, and, juliet, perhaps, the, best, example, of, the, mixing, of, the, styles, by, the, time, of, romeo, and, juliet, richard, ii, and, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, in, the, mid, 1590s, shakespeare, had, begun, to, write, a, more, natural, poetry, he, increasingly, tuned, his, metaphors, and, images, to, the, needs, of, the, drama, itself, shakespeare, s, standard, poetic, form, was, blank, verse, composed, in, iambic, pentameter, in, practice, this, meant, that, his, verse, was, usually, unrhymed, and, consisted, of, ten, syllables, to, a, line, spoken, with, a, stress, on, every, second, syllable, the, blank, verse, of, his, early, plays, is, quite, different, from, that, of, his, later, ones, it, is, often, beautiful, but, its, sentences, tend, to, start, pause, and, finish, at, the, end, of, lines, with, the, risk, of, monotony, once, shakespeare, mastered, traditional, blank, verse, he, began, to, interrupt, and, vary, its, flow, this, technique, releases, the, new, power, and, flexibility, of, the, poetry, in, plays, such, as, julius, caesar, and, hamlet, shakespeare, uses, it, for, example, to, convey, the, turmoil, in, hamlet, s, mind, sir, in, my, heart, there, was, a, kind, of, fighting, that, would, not, let, me, sleep, methought, i, lay, worse, than, the, mutines, in, the, bilboes, rashly, and, prais, d, be, rashness, for, it, let, us, know, our, indiscretion, sometimes, serves, us, well, after, hamlet, shakespeare, varied, his, poetic, style, further, particularly, in, the, more, emotional, passages, of, the, late, tragedies, the, literary, critic, a, c, bradley, described, this, style, as, more, concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in, construction, less, regular, not, seldom, twisted, or, elliptical, in, the, last, phase, of, his, career, shakespeare, adopted, many, techniques, to, achieve, these, effects, these, included, run, on, lines, irregular, pauses, and, stops, and, extreme, variations, in, sentence, structure, and, length, in, macbeth, for, example, the, language, darts, from, one, unrelated, metaphor, or, simile, to, another, was, the, hope, drunk, wherein, you, dressed, yourself, 1, 7, 35, 38, pity, like, a, naked, new, born, babe, striding, the, blast, or, heaven, s, cherubim, hors, d, upon, the, sightless, couriers, of, the, air, 1, 7, 21, 25, the, listener, is, challenged, to, complete, the, sense, the, late, romances, with, their, shifts, in, time, and, surprising, turns, of, plot, inspired, a, last, poetic, style, in, which, long, and, short, sentences, are, set, against, one, another, clauses, are, piled, up, subject, and, object, are, reversed, and, words, are, omitted, creating, an, effect, of, spontaneity, shakespeare, combined, poetic, genius, with, a, practical, sense, of, the, theatre, like, all, playwrights, of, the, time, he, dramatised, stories, from, sources, such, as, plutarch, and, holinshed, he, reshaped, each, plot, to, create, several, centres, of, interest, and, to, show, as, many, sides, of, a, narrative, to, the, audience, as, possible, this, strength, of, design, ensures, that, a, shakespeare, play, can, survive, translation, cutting, and, wide, interpretation, without, loss, to, its, core, drama, as, shakespeare, s, mastery, grew, he, gave, his, characters, clearer, and, more, varied, motivations, and, distinctive, patterns, of, speech, he, preserved, aspects, of, his, earlier, style, in, the, later, plays, however, in, shakespeare, s, late, romances, he, deliberately, returned, to, a, more, artificial, style, which, emphasised, the, illusion, of, theatre, shakespeare, s, work, has, made, a, significant, and, lasting, impression, on, later, theatre, and, literature, in, particular, he, expanded, the, dramatic, potential, of, characterisation, plot, language, and, genre, until, romeo, and, juliet, for, example, romance, had, not, been, viewed, as, a, worthy, topic, for, tragedy, soliloquies, had, been, used, mainly, to, convey, information, about, characters, or, events, but, shakespeare, used, them, to, explore, characters, minds, his, work, heavily, influenced, later, poetry, the, romantic, poets, attempted, to, revive, shakespearean, verse, drama, though, with, little, success, critic, george, steiner, described, all, english, verse, dramas, from, coleridge, to, tennyson, as, feeble, variations, on, shakespearean, themes, john,

mendelssohn, s, overture, and, incidental, music, for, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, and, sergei, prokofiev, s, ballet, romeo, and, juliet, his, work, has, inspired, several, operas, among, them, giuseppe, verdi, s, macbeth, otello, and, falstaff, whose, critical, standing, compares, with, that, of, the, source, plays, shakespeare, has, also, inspired, many, painters, including, the, romantics, and, the, pre, raphaelites, while, william, hogarth, s, 1745, painting, of, actor, david, garrick, playing, richard, iii, was, decisive, in, establishing, the, genre, of, theatrical,

extends, far, beyond, his, native, england, and, the, english, language, his, reception, in, germany, was, particularly, significant, as, early, as, the, 18th, century, shakespeare, was, widely, translated, and, popularised, in, germany, and, gradually, became, a, classic, of, the, german, weimar, era, christoph, martin, wieland, was, the, first, to, produce, complete, translations, of,

most, translated, author, in, history, he, was, not, of, an, age, but, for, all, time, ben, jonson, shakespeare, was, not, revered, in, his, lifetime, but, he, received, a, large, amount, of, praise, in, 1598, the, cleric, and, author, francis, meres, singled, him, out, from, a, group, of, english, playwrights, as, the, most, excellent, in, both, comedy, and, tragedy, the, authors, of, the,

applause, delight, the, wonder, of, our, stage, although, he, had, remarked, elsewhere, that, shakespeare, wanted, art, lacked, skill, between, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, and, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, classical, ideas, were, in, vogue, as, a, result, critics, of, the, time, mostly, rated, shakespeare, below, john, fletcher, and, ben, jonson, thomas, rymer, for, example, condemned, shakespeare, for, mixing, the, comic, with, the, tragic, nevertheless, poet, and, critic, john, dryden, rated, shakespeare, highly, saying, of, jonson, i, admire, him, but, i, love, shakespeare, he, also, famously, remarked, that, shakespeare, was, naturally, learned, he, needed, not, the, spectacles, of, books, to, read, nature, he, looked, inwards, and, found, her, there, for, several, decades, rymer, s, view, held, sway, but, during, the, 18th, century, critics, began, to, respond, to, shakespeare, on, his, own, terms, and, like, dryden, to, acclaim, what, they, termed, his, natural, genius, a, series, of, scholarly, editions, of, his, work, notably, those, of, samuel, johnson, in, 1765, and, edmond, malone, in, 1790, added, to, his, growing, reputation, by, 1800, he, was, firmly, enshrined, as, the, national, poet, and, described, as, the, bard, of, avon, or, simply, the, bard, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, his, reputation, also, spread, abroad, among, those, who, championed, him, were, the, writers, voltaire, goethe, stendhal, and, victor, hugo, during, the, romantic, era, shakespeare, was, praised, by, the, poet, and, literary, philosopher, samuel, taylor, coleridge, and, the, critic, august, wilhelm, schlegel, translated, his, plays, in, the, spirit, of, german, romanticism, in, the, 19th, century, critical, admiration, for, shakespeare, s, genius, often, bordered, on, adulation, this, king, shakespeare, the, essayist, thomas, carlyle, wrote, in, 1840, does, not, he, shine, in, crowned, sovereignty, over, us, all, as, the, noblest, gentlest, yet, strongest, of, rallying, signs, indestructible, the, victorians, produced, his, plays, as, lavish, spectacles, on, a, grand, scale, the, playwright, and, critic, george,

the, arts, during, the, early, 20th, century, far, from, discarding, shakespeare, eagerly, enlisted, his, work, in, the, service, of, the, avant, garde, the, expressionists, in, germany, and, the,

works, attributed, to, him, proposed, alternative, candidates, include, francis, bacon, christopher, marlowe, and, edward, de, vere, 17th, earl, of, oxford, several, group, theories, have, also, been, proposed, all, but, a, few, shakespeare, scholars, and, literary, historians, consider, it, a, fringe, theory, with, only, a, small, minority, of, academics, who, believe, that, there, is, reason, to, question, the, traditional, attribution, but, interest, in, the, subject, particularly, the, oxfordian, theory, of, shakespeare, authorship, continues, into, the, 21st, century, shakespeare, conformed, to, the, official, state, religion, but, his, private, views, on, religion, have, been, the, subject, of, debate, shakespeare, s, will, uses, a, protestant, formula, and, he, was, a, confirmed, member, of, the, church, of, england, where, he, was, married, his, children, were, baptised, and, where, he, is, buried, some, scholars, are, of, the, view, that, members, of, shakespeare, s, family, were, catholics, at, a, time, when, practising, catholicism, in, england, was, against, the, law, shakespeare, s, mother, mary, arden, certainly, came, from, a, pious, catholic, family, the, strongest, evidence, might, be, a, catholic, statement, of, faith, signed, by, his, father, john, shakespeare, found, in, 1757, in, the, rafters, of, his, former, house, in, henley, street, however, the, document, is, now, lost, and, scholars, differ, as, to, its, authenticity, in, 1591, the, authorities, reported, that, john, shakespeare, had, missed, church, for, fear, of, process, for, debt, a, common, catholic, excuse, in, 1606, the, name, of, william, s, daughter, susanna, appears, on, a, list, of, those, who, failed, to, attend, easter, communion, in, stratford, other, authors, argue, that, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, about, shakespeare, s, religious, beliefs, scholars, find, evidence, both, for, and, against, shakespeare, s, catholicism, protestantism, or, lack, of, belief, in, his, plays, but, the, truth, may, be, impossible, to, prove, few, details, of, shakespeare, s, sexuality, are, known, at, 18, he, married, 26, year, old, anne, hathaway, who, was, pregnant, susanna, the, first, of, their, three, children, was, born, six, months, later, on, 26, may, 1583, over, the, centuries, some, readers, have, posited, that, shakespeare, s, sonnets, are, autobiographical, and, point, to, them, as, evidence, of, his, love, for, a, young, man, others, read, the, same, passages, as, the, expression, of, intense, friendship, rather, than, romantic, love, the, 26, so, called, dark, lady, sonnets, addressed, to, a, married, woman, are, taken, as, evidence, of, heterosexual, liaisons, no, written, contemporary, description, of, shakespeare, s, physical, appearance, survives, and, no, evidence, suggests, that, he, ever, commissioned, a, portrait, from, the, 18th, century, the, desire, for, authentic, shakespeare, portraits, fuelled, claims, that, various, surviving, pictures, depicted, shakespeare, that, demand, also, led, to, the, production, of, several, fake, portraits, as, well, as, misattributions, re, paintings, and, relabelling, of, portraits, of, other, people, some, scholars, suggest, that, the, droeshout, portrait, which, ben, jonson, approved, of, as, a, good, likeness, and, his, stratford, monument, provide, perhaps, the, best, evidence, of, his, appearance, of, the, claimed, paintings, art, historian, tarnya, cooper, concluded, that, the, chandos, portrait, shown, at, the, top, of, this, article, had, the, strongest, claim, of, any, of, the, known, contenders, to, be, a, true, portrait, of, shakespeare, after, a, three, year, study, supported, by, the, national, portrait, gallery, london, the, portrait, s, owners, cooper, contended, that, its, composition, date, contemporary, with, shakespeare, its, subsequent, provenance, and, the, sitter, s, attire, all, supported, the, attribution, education
