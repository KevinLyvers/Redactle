encouraged, rohingya, to, return, after, being, displaced, however, experts, have, largely, criticized, the, burmese, investigations, as, insincere, with, the, military, declaring, itself, innocent, and, the, government, preventing, a, visit, from, investigators, from, the, united, nations, many, rohingya, have, also, not, returned, due, to, perceiving, danger, and, a, lack, of, rights, in,
