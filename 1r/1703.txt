brought, her, to, the, farm, of, a, friend, in, the, kenya, highlands, in, 1957, from, there, she, obtained, work, as, a, secretary, and, acting, on, her, friend, s, advice, she, telephoned, louis, leakey, the, kenyan, archaeologist, and, palaeontologist, with, no, other, thought, than, to, make, an, appointment, to, discuss, animals, leakey, believing, that, the, study, of, existing, great, apes, could, provide, indications, of, the, behaviour, of, early, hominids, was, looking, for, a, chimpanzee, researcher, though, he, kept, the, idea, to, himself, instead, he, proposed, that, goodall, work, for, him, as, a, secretary, after, obtaining, approval, from, his, co, researcher, and, wife, british, paleoanthropologist, mary, leakey, louis, sent, goodall, to, olduvai, gorge, in,

napier, leakey, raised, funds, and, on, 14, july, 1960, goodall, went, to, gombe, stream, national, park, becoming, the, first, of, what, would, come, to, be, called, the, trimates, she, was, accompanied, by, her, mother, whose, presence, was, necessary, to, satisfy, the, requirements, of, david, anstey, chief, warden, who, was, concerned, for, their, safety, goodall, credits, her, mother, with, encouraging, her, to, pursue, a, career, in, primatology, a, male, dominated, field, at, the, time, goodall, has, stated, that, women, were, not, accepted, in, the, field, when, she, started, her, research, in, the, late, 1950s, as, of, 2019, the, field, of, primatology, is, made, up, almost, evenly, of, men, and, women, in, part, thanks, to, the, trailblazing, of, goodall, and, her, encouragement, of, young, women, to, join, the, field, leakey, arranged, funding, and, in, 1962, he, sent, goodall, who, had, no, degree, to, the, university, of, cambridge, she, was, the, eighth, person, to, be, allowed, to, study, for, a, phd, at, cambridge, without, first, having, obtained, a, bachelor, s, degree, she, went, to, newnham, college, cambridge, where, she, received, her, bachelor, of, arts, in, natural, sciences, by, 1964, which, is, when, she, went, up, to, the, new, darwin, college, cambridge, for, a, doctor, of, philosophy, in, ethology, her, thesis, was, completed, in, 1966, under, the, supervision, of, robert, hinde, on, the, behaviour, of, free, living, chimpanzees, detailing, her, first, five, years, of, study, at, the, gombe, reserve, on, 19, june, 2006, the, open, university, of, tanzania, awarded, her, an, honorary, doctor, of, science, degree, goodall, studied, chimpanzee, social, and, family, life, beginning, with, the, kasakela, chimpanzee, community, in, gombe, stream, national, park, tanzania, in, 1960, she, found, that, it, isn, t, only, human, beings, who, have, personality, who, are, capable, of, rational, thought, emotions, like, joy, and, sorrow, she, also, observed, behaviours, such, as, hugs, kisses, pats, on, the, back, and, even, tickling, what, we, consider, human, actions, goodall, insists, that, these, gestures, are, evidence, of, the, close, supportive, affectionate, bonds, that, develop, between, family, members, and, other, individuals, within, a, community, which, can, persist, throughout, a, life, span, of, more, than, 50, years, goodall, s, research, at, gombe, stream, challenged, two, long, standing, beliefs, of, the, day, that, only, humans, could, construct, and, use, tools, and, that, chimpanzees, were, vegetarians, while, observing, one, chimpanzee, feeding, at, a, termite, mound, she, watched, him, repeatedly, place, stalks, of, grass, into, termite, holes, then, remove, them, from, the, hole, covered, with, clinging, termites, effectively, fishing, for, termites, the, chimpanzees, would, also, take, twigs, from, trees, and, strip, off, the, leaves, to, make, the, twig, more, effective, a, form, of, object, modification, that, is, the, rudimentary, beginnings, of, toolmaking, humans, had, long, distinguished, themselves, from, the, rest, of, the, animal, kingdom, as, man, the, toolmaker, in, response, to, goodall, s, revolutionary, findings, louis, leakey, wrote, we, must, now, redefine, man, redefine, tool, or, accept, chimpanzees, as, human, in, contrast, to, the, peaceful, and, affectionate, behaviours, she, observed, goodall, also, found, an, aggressive, side, of, chimpanzee, nature, at, gombe, stream, she, discovered, that, chimpanzees, will, systematically, hunt, and, eat, smaller, primates, such, as, colobus, monkeys, goodall, watched, a, hunting, group, isolate, a, colobus, monkey, high, in, a, tree, and, block, all, possible, exits, then, one, chimpanzee, climbed, up, and, captured, and, killed, the, colobus, the, others, then, each, took, parts, of, the, carcass, sharing, with, other, members, of, the, troop, in, response, to, begging, behaviours, the, chimpanzees, at, gombe, kill, and, eat, as, much, as, one, third, of, the, colobus, population, in, the, park, each, year, this, alone, was, a, major, scientific, find, that, challenged, previous, conceptions, of, chimpanzee, diet, and, behaviour, goodall, also, observed, the, tendency, for, aggression, and, violence, within, chimpanzee, troops, goodall, observed, dominant, females, deliberately, killing, the, young, of, other, females, in, the, troop, to, maintain, their, dominance, sometimes, going, as, far, as, cannibalism, she, says, of, this, revelation, during, the, first, ten, years, of, the, study, i, had, believed, that, the, gombe, chimpanzees, were, for, the, most, part, rather, nicer, than, human, beings, then, suddenly, we, found, that, chimpanzees, could, be, brutal, that, they, like, us, had, a, darker, side, to, their, nature, she, described, the, 1974, 1978, gombe, chimpanzee, war, in, her, 1990, memoir, through, a, window, my, thirty, years, with, the, chimpanzees, of, gombe, her, findings, revolutionised, contemporary, knowledge, of, chimpanzee, behaviour, and, were, further, evidence, of, the, social, similarities, between, humans, and, chimpanzees, goodall, set, herself, apart, from, convention, by, naming, the, animals, in, her, studies, of, primates, instead, of, assigning, each, a, number, numbering, was, a, nearly, universal, practice, at, the, time, and, was, thought, to, be, important, in, the, removal, of, oneself, from, the, potential, for, emotional, attachment, to, the, subject, being, studied, setting, herself, apart, from, other, researchers, also, led, her, to, develop, a, close, bond, with, the, chimpanzees, and, to, become, the, only, human, ever, accepted, into, chimpanzee, society, she, was, the, lowest, ranking, member, of, a, troop, for, a, period, of, 22, months, among, those, whom, goodall, named, during, her, years, in, gombe, were, in, 1977, goodall, established, the, jane, goodall, institute, jgi, which, supports, the, gombe, research, and, she, is, a, global, leader, in, the, effort, to, protect, chimpanzees, and, their, habitats, with, nineteen, offices, around, the, world, the, jgi, is, widely, recognised, for, community, centred, conservation, and, development, programs, in, africa, its, global, youth, program, roots, shoots, began, in, 1991, when, a, group, of, 16, local, teenagers, met, with, goodall, on, her, back, porch, in, dar, es, salaam, tanzania, they, were, eager, to, discuss, a, range, of, problems, they, knew, about, from, first, hand, experience, that, caused, them, deep, concern, the, organisation, has, over, 10, 000, groups, in, over, 100, countries, as, of, 2010, in, 1992, goodall, founded, the, tchimpounga, chimpanzee, rehabilitation, centre, in, the, republic, of, congo, to, care, for, chimpanzees, orphaned, due, to, bush, meat, trade, the, rehabilitation, houses, over, a, hundred, chimps, over, its, three, islands, in, 1994, goodall, founded, the, lake, tanganyika, catchment, reforestation, and, education, tacare, or, take, care, pilot, project, to, protect, chimpanzees, habitat, from, deforestation, by, reforesting, hills, around, gombe, while, simultaneously, educating, neighbouring, communities, on, sustainability, and, agriculture, training, the, tacare, project, also, supports, young, girls, by, offering, them, access, to, reproductive, health, education, and, through, scholarships, to, finance, their, college, tuition, owing, to, an, overflow, of, handwritten, notes, photographs, and, data, piling, up, at, jane, s, home, in, dar, es, salaam, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, jane, goodall, institute, s, center, for, primate, studies, was, created, at, the, university, of, minnesota, to, house, and, organise, this, data, as, of, 2011, all, of, the, original, jane, goodall, archives, reside, there, and, have, been, digitised, analysed, and, placed, in, an, online,

the, diet, for, ethical, environmental, and, health, reasons, in, the, inner, world, of, farm, animals, 2009, goodall, writes, that, farm, animals, are, far, more, aware, and, intelligent, than, we, ever, imagined, and, despite, having, been, bred, as, domestic, slaves, they, are, individual, beings, in, their, own, right, as, such, they, deserve, our, respect, and, our, help, who, will, plead, for, them, if, we, are, silent, goodall, has, also, said, thousands, of, people, who, say, they, love, animals, sit, down, once, or, twice, a, day, to, enjoy, the, flesh, of, creatures, who, have, been, treated, so, with, little, respect, and, kindness, just, to, make, more, meat, in, 2021, goodall, became, a, vegan, and, authored, a, cookbook, titled, eat, meat, less, goodall, is, an,

for, alternative, methods, of, medical, research, she, controversially, described, edinburgh, zoo, s, new, primate, enclosure, as, a, wonderful, facility, where, monkeys, are, probably, better, off, living, in, the, wild, in, an, area, like, budongo, where, one, in, six, gets, caught, in, a, wire, snare, and, countries, like, congo, where, chimpanzees, monkeys, and, gorillas, are, shot, for, food, commercially, this, was, in, conflict, with, advocates, for, animals, position, on, captive, animals, in, june, that, year, she, resigned, the, presidency, of, the, organisation, which, she,

it, difficult, to, recognize, familiar, faces, goodall, was, raised, in, a, christian, congregationalist, family, as, a, young, woman, she, took, night, classes, in, theosophy, her, family, were, occasional, churchgoers, but, goodall, began, attending, more, regularly, as, a, teenager, when, the, church, appointed, a, new, minister, trevor, davies, he, was, highly, intelligent, and, his, sermons, were, powerful, and, thought, provoking, i, could, have, listened, to, his, voice, for, hours, i, fell, madly, in, love, with, him, suddenly, no, one, had, to, encourage, me, to, go, to, church, indeed, there, were, never, enough, services, for, my, liking, of, her, later, discovery, of, the, atheism, and, agnosticism, of, many, of, her, scientific, colleagues, goodall, wrote, that, ortunately, by, the, time, i, got, to, cambridge, i, was, twenty, seven, years, old, and, my, beliefs, had, already, moulded, so, that, i, was, not, influenced, by, these, opinions, in, her, 1999, book, reason, for, hope, a, spiritual, journey, goodall, describes, the, implications, of, a, mystical, experience, she, had, at, notre, dame, cathedral, in, 1977, since, i, cannot, believe, that, this, was, the, result, of, chance, i, have, to, admit, anti, chance, and, so, i, must, believe, in, a, guiding, power, in, the, universe, in, other, words, i, must, believe, in, god, when, asked, if, she, believes, in, god, goodall, said, in, september, 2010, i, don, t, have, any, idea, of, who, or, what, god, is, but, i, do, believe, in, some, great, spiritual, power, i, feel, it, particularly, when, i, m, out, in, nature, it, s, just, something, that, s, bigger, and, stronger, than, what, i, am, or, what, anybody, is, i, feel, it, and, it, s, enough, for, me, when, asked, in, the, same, year, if, she, still, considers, herself, a, christian, goodall, told, the, guardian, i, suppose, so, i, was, raised, as, a, christian, and, stated, that, she, saw, no, contradiction, between, evolution, and, belief, in, god, in, her, foreword, to, the, 2017, book, the, intelligence, of, the, cosmos, by, ervin, laszlo, a, philosopher, of, science, who, advocates, quantum, consciousness, theory, goodall, wrote, we, must, accept, that, there, is, an, intelligence, driving, the, process, that, the, universe, and, life, on, earth, are, inspired, and, in, formed, by, an, unknown, and, unknowable, creator, a, supreme, being, a, great, spiritual, power, goodall, used, unconventional, practices, in, her, study, for, example, naming, individuals, instead, of, numbering, them, at, the, time, numbering, was, used, to, prevent, emotional, attachment, and, loss, of, objectivity, goodall, wrote, in, 1993, when, in, the, early, 1960s, i, brazenly, used, such, words, as, childhood, adolescence, motivation, excitement, and, mood, i, was, much, criticised, even, worse, was, my, crime, of, suggesting, that, chimpanzees, had, personalities, i, was, ascribing, human, characteristics, to, nonhuman, animals, and, was, thus, guilty, of, that, worst, of, ethological, sins, anthropomorphism, many, standard, methods, aim, to, avoid, interference, by, observers, and, in, particular, some, believe, that, the, use, of, feeding, stations, to, attract, gombe, chimpanzees, has, altered, normal, foraging, and, feeding, patterns, and, social, relationships, this, argument, is, the, focus, of, a, book, published, by, margaret, power, in, 1991, it, has, been, suggested, that, higher, levels, of, aggression, and, conflict, with, other, chimpanzee, groups, in, the, area, were, due, to, the, feeding, which, could, have, created, the, wars, between, chimpanzee, social, groups, described, by, goodall, aspects, of, which, she, did, not, witness, in, the, years, before, artificial, feeding, began, at, gombe, thus, some, regard, goodall, s, observations, as, distortions, of, normal, chimpanzee, behaviour, goodall, herself, acknowledged, that, feeding, contributed, to, aggression, within, and, between, groups, but, maintained, that, the, effect, was, limited, to, alteration, of, the, intensity, and, not, the, nature, of, chimpanzee, conflict, and, further, suggested, that, feeding, was, necessary, for, the, study, to, be, effective, at, all, craig, stanford, of, the, jane, goodall, research, institute, at, the, university, of, southern, california, states, that, researchers, conducting, studies, with, no, artificial, provisioning, have, a, difficult, time, viewing, any, social, behaviour, of, chimpanzees, especially, those, related, to, inter, group, conflict, some, recent, studies, such, as, those, by, crickette, sanz, in, the, goualougo, triangle, congo, and, christophe, boesch, in, the, ta, national, park, ivory, coast, have, not, shown, the, aggression, observed, in, the, gombe, studies, however, other, primatologists, disagree, that, the, studies, are, flawed, for, example, jim, moore, provides, a, critique, of, margaret, powers, assertions, and, some, studies, of, other, chimpanzee, groups, have, shown, aggression, similar, to, that, in, gombe, even, in, the, absence, of, feeding, on, 22, march, 2013, hachette, book, group, announced, that, goodall, s, and, co, author, gail, hudson, s, new, book, seeds, of, hope, would, not, be, released, on, 2, april, as, planned, due, to, the, discovery, of, plagiarised, portions, a, reviewer, for, the, washington, post, found, unattributed, sections, that, were, copied, from, websites, about, organic, tea, and, tobacco, and, an, amateurish, astrology, site, as, well, as, from, wikipedia, goodall, apologised, and, stated, it, is, important, to, me, that, the, proper, sources, are, credited, and, i, will, be, working, diligently, with, my, team, to, address, all, areas, of, concern, my, goal, is, to, ensure, that, when, this, book, is, released, it, is, not, only, up, to, the, highest, of, standards, but, also, that, the, focus, be, on, the, crucial, messages, it, conveys, the, book, was, released, on, 1, april, 2014, after, review, and, the, addition, of, 57, pages, of, endnotes, goodall, is, known, to, support, the, possibility, that, undiscovered, species,
