and, final, test, after, alf, valentine, had, fallen, ill, sobers, was, selected, as, a, bowler, despite, only, mediocre, performances, against, england, for, barbados, he, made, a, good, impression, by, taking, 4, 75, in, england, s, first, innings, including, a, wicket, in, his, opening, over, sobers, also, scored, 14, not, out, and, 26, batting, at, number, nine, however, england, won, the, match, by, nine, wickets, australia, toured, the, west, indies, in, 1954, 55, and, their, all, rounder, keith, miller, thought, that, sobers, would, become, a, better, batsman, than, bowler, despite, batting, in, the, lower, order, sobers, was, not, selected, for, the, first, test, which, the, west, indies, lost, by, nine, wickets, however, he, regained, his, place, for, the, second, test, in, port, of, spain, trinidad, and, tobago, the, match, was, a, high, scoring, draw, with, sobers, scoring, 47, and, eight, not, out, he, was, barely, used, with, the, ball, bowling, three, overs, for, ten, runs, as, australia, amassed, a, first, innings, total, of, over, 600, sobers, was, given, a, further, opportunity, in, the, next, test, in, georgetown, guyana, british, guiana, at, the, time, in, south, america, despite, scoring, only, 12, and, 11, with, the, bat, he, took, three, wickets, in, the, australians, first, innings, nevertheless, australia, won, by, eight, wickets, west, indian, captain, and, opening, batsman, jeff, stollmeyer, twisted, his, ankle, after, treading, on, a, ball, ahead, of, the, fourth, test, in, barbados, triggering, huge, debate, about, who, should, open, eventually, sobers, was, chosen, to, open, the, innings, after, australia, had, amassed, another, total, of, over, 600, sobers, had, a, suspicion, he, might, be, asked, to, do, the, job, i, couldn, t, see, them, sending, in, anyone, else, i, was, a, bowler, with, a, little, ability, as, a, batsman, and, they, wanted, someone, to, help, see, off, the, shine, and, protect, the, three, w, s, sobers, struck, his, first, three, deliveries, for, boundaries, all, from, the, bowling, of, miller, in, the, fast, bowler, s, second, over, sobers, hit, him, for, another, three, fours, he, was, eventually, dismissed, for, 43, out, of, a, first, wicket, partnership, of, 52, with, john, holt, the, match, was, drawn, and, sobers, took, one, wicket, in, the, australians, only, innings, before, scoring, 11, in, the, west, indies, second, innings, the, home, team, were, again, defeated, in, the, fifth, and, final, test, in, jamaica, sobers, performed, with, the, bat, however, scoring, 35, not, out, and, 64, sobers, went, on, his, first, overseas, tour, in, the, early, months, of, 1956, when, aged, 19, he, was, part, of, the, west, indian, tour, of, new, zealand, the, series, was, not, successful, personally, for, sobers, who, struggled, on, the, foreign, batting, wickets, west, indies, pitches, had, little, or, no, grass, while, in, new, zealand, the, pitches, were, green, i, took, one, look, and, asked, myself, how, i, could, possibly, bat, on, that, how, could, i, make, runs, i, was, out, before, i, even, walked, to, the, crease, sobers, later, wrote, playing, in, all, four, tests, he, totalled, 81, runs, and, two, wickets, as, a, batsman, sobers, needed, time, to, develop, at, test, level, and, in, nine, tests, as, a, teenager, he, scored, only, one, half, century, and, averaged, 29, 33, with, the, bat, sobers, was, sent, home, from, new, zealand, early, to, play, an, unofficial, test, match, against, an, england, team, that, included, feared, fast, bowler, frank, tyson, after, struggling, to, cope, with, tyson, s, pace, sobers, managed, to, score, a, half, century, raising, hope, that, he, would, be, selected, for, the, upcoming, tour, to, england, something, he, considered, unlikely, after, his, lack, of, form, in, the, first, trial, match, to, help, select, the, squad, for, the, upcoming, tour, sobers, scored, a, century, in, trinidad, the, matches, also, saw, sobers, get, his, first, look, at, west, indian, cricket, politics, wes, hall, and, frank, mason, were, competing, for, a, single, place, in, the, touring, party, and, sobers, and, everton, weekes, decided, they, would, take, on, mason, and, knock, him, out, of, the, firing, line, to, try, and, get, our, fellow, bajan, countryman, wes, in, the, team, the, pair, attacked, mason, while, they, defended, hall, in, a, tactic, that, paid, off, with, hall, selected, despite, sobers, believing, mason, was, the, better, bowler, at, the, time, sobers, toured, england, for, their, summer, in, 1957, he, played, his, first, match, against, the, jim, swanton, xi, in, april, and, was, surprised, about, how, cold, the, conditions, were, often, causing, him, to, wear, two, or, three, jumpers, his, performances, with, the, bat, throughout, the, five, test, series, were, classed, as, mediocre, scoring, 320, runs, at, 32, with, three, half, centuries, on, the, bowling, front, sobers, struggled, taking, five, wickets, at, 71, it, was, in, the, final, test, at, the, oval, that, sobers, gained, the, attention, of, critics, with, defiant, batting, amid, a, disappointing, team, performance, the, condition, of, the, pitch, was, subject, to, criticism, and, described, by, wisden, cricketers, almanack, as, a, strange, sight, after, england, had, scored, 412, the, west, indies, were, easily, dismissed, for, 89, and, 86, by, the, surrey, spinners, jim, laker, and, tony, lock, who, were, playing, on, their, home, ground, batting, at, number, 3, sobers, made, 39, and, 42, while, none, of, his, colleagues, passed, 30, in, either, innings, in, its, summary, of, the, tour, wisden, said, of, the, newcomers, collie, smith, sobers, rohan, kanhai, and, roy, gilchrist, were, particularly, impressive, adding, that, to, sobers, a, tall, left, handed, all, rounder, fell, the, distinction, of, hitting, the, highest, score, of, the, tour, 219, not, out, against, nottinghamshire, at, trent, bridge, sobers, undoubtedly, was, a, very, fine, stroke, player, who, should, go, far, at, this, stage, of, his, career, sobers, had, frustrated, his, admirers, by, failing, to, convert, good, starts, into, high, scores, he, had, reached, double, figures, in, 18, of, his, 22, test, innings, although, his, highest, score, was, still, only, 66, but, in, the, three, years, following, the, 1957, tour, he, fulfilled, his, promise, in, his, next, 24, tests, he, scored, 2, 250, runs, at, the, exceptionally, high, average, of, 93, 75, in, 1958, he, scored, his, maiden, test, century, against, pakistan, in, kingston, and, expanded, it, to, an, unbeaten, 365, breaking, the, world, record, test, score, of, 364, set, by, england, s, len, hutton, in, 1938, sobers, batted, for, 614, minutes, and, scored, 38, fours, but, unusually, in, such, a, large, total, no, sixes, at, 21, years, and, 216, days, he, is, the, youngest, player, to, break, the, individual, scoring, record, in, tests, and, remains, the, youngest, triple, centurion, sir, garfield, sobers, set, the, world, records, for, the, highest, maiden, test, ton, 365, as, well, as, becoming, the, first, batsman, in, test, history, to, convert, his, maiden, test, ton, into, a, triple, ton, he, made, 824, runs, with, three, centuries, in, the, five, tests, against, pakistan, and, followed, this, with, 557, runs, and, three, more, centuries, on, the, west, indies, tour, of, india, in, 1958, 59, sobers, underwent, trauma, following, the, death, of, collie, smith, in, september, 1959, but, he, continued, to, play, cricket, successfully, in, the, home, test, series, against, england, in, 1959, 60, he, scored, three, centuries, in, five, matches, totalling, 709, runs, largely, inspired, by, new, west, indies, captain, sir, frank, worrell, who, was, a, close, personal, friend, sobers, had, an, outstanding, 1960, 61, series, in, australia, he, scored, a, celebrated, 132, on, the, first, day, of, the, first, test, at, brisbane, cricket, ground, the, match, which, resulted, in, the, first, tied, test, wisden, confirmed, that, some, observers, considered, it, the, best, hundred, they, had, ever, seen, sobers, scored, 430, runs, in, the, series, which, australia, won, 2, 1, with, two, centuries, his, fielding, was, outstanding, and, he, took, 12, catches, he, felt, he, had, had, a, good, series, starting, badly, but, then, coming, on, and, a, very, positive, outcome, for, him, was, to, receive, an, invitation, from, don, bradman, to, play, for, south, australia, in, 1961, 62, sobers, took, 15, wickets, in, the, 1960, 61, series, including, a, best, analysis, of, 5, 120, at, an, average, of, 39, 20, and, his, bowling, allowed, worrell, to, play, an, extra, batsman, in, the, final, three, tests, thus, using, sobers, for, the, first, time, as, a, designated, all, rounder, a, role, in, which, he, became, the, dominant, player, in, world, cricket, over, the, next, decade, being, awarded, the, wisden, leading, cricketer, in, the, world, title, retrospectively, eight, times, in, 13, years, sobers, was, never, a, prolific, wicket, taker, in, test, cricket, and, his, average, of, three, wickets, per, game, in, this, series, typified, his, whole, career, overall, he, took, 235, wickets, in, his, 93, tests, at, an, average, of, 34, 03, and, was, more, effective, when, operating, as, a, pace, bowler, his, best, performance, was, 6, 73, and, although, he, achieved, five, wickets, in, an, innings, six, times, he, never, took, ten, in, a, match, his, success, continued, in, the, next, two, series, at, home, to, india, in, 1961, 62, and, away, to, england, in, 1963, he, was, elected, wisden, cricketer, of, the, year, in, 1964, and, then, succeeded, worrell, who, had, retired, as, west, indies, captain, for, the, 1964, 65, home, series, against, australia, sobers, enjoyed, immediate, success, as, west, indies, captain, when, his, team, defeated, australia, by, 179, runs, in, the, first, test, at, sabina, park, west, indies, went, on, to, win, the, series, 2, 1, and, so, claim, the, new, frank, worrell, trophy, this, was, the, first, time, west, indies, had, beaten, australia, in, a, test, series, he, enjoyed, spectacular, success, in, england, in, 1966, and, was, widely, acclaimed, as, king, cricket, in, the, five, tests, he, scored, 722, runs, at, an, average, of, 103, 14, with, three, centuries, and, had, 20, wickets, at, 27, 25, as, well, as, taking, 10, catches, west, indies, won, the, series, 3, 1, with, one, match, drawn, his, status, was, celebrated, at, that, time, by, the, trinidadian, calypso, artist, mighty, sparrow, with, his, song, sir, garfield, sobers, in, 1966, 67, sobers, captained, the, west, indies, team, to, india, in, 1966, 67, and, they, won, the, series, 2, 0, with, one, match, drawn, he, lost, a, series, for, the, first, time, in, 1967, 68, when, west, indies, were, surprisingly, beaten, at, home, by, england, four, matches, were, drawn, and, england, won, the, fourth, test, at, queen, s, park, oval, following, a, controversial, declaration, by, sobers, which, enabled, england, to, score, the, necessary, 215, 3, to, win, at, just, four, runs, an, over, in, 1968, 69, sobers, captained, the, west, indian, cricket, team, in, australia, in, 1968, 69, but, they, lost, the, series, 3, 1, and, then, drew, a, three, test, series, in, new, zealand, 1, 1, in, 1969, west, indies, lost, 2, 0, in, england, with, one, match, drawn, sobers, captained, west, indies, for, the, five, test, home, series, versus, india, in, 1970, 71, india, won, the, series, 1, 0, with, four, matches, drawn, a, year, later, sobers, led, west, indies, in, five, home, tests, against, new, zealand, and, all, five, were, drawn, sobers, was, succeeded, as, west, indies, captain, by, rohan, kanhai, for, the, 1972, 73, home, series, against, australia, sobers, did, not, play, in, that, series, but, returned, to, play, under, kanhai, in, england, in, 1973, he, played, his, last, test, in, march, 1974, at, queen, s, park, oval, against, england, when, south, africa, were, banned, from, international, cricket, because, of, the, country, s, apartheid, policy, south, africa, s, two, lucrative, tours, to, england, in, 1970, and, to, australia, in, 1971, 72, were, cancelled, the, cricket, authorities, responded, by, forming, a, rest, of, the, world, team, to, play, two, unofficial, test, series, instead, and, these, teams, included, some, leading, south, african, players, sobers, was, invited, to, captain, the, rest, of, the, world, xi, in, england, and, a, world, xi, in, australia, in, 1970, captaining, the, rest, of, the, world, xi, against, england, he, took, 6, 21, on, the, opening, day, of, the, first, unofficial, test, at, lord, s, with, pace, bowling, the, ball, swinging, and, seaming, at, high, speed, he, then, scored, a, magnificent, 183, and, helped, bowl, out, england, in, the, second, innings, using, his, left, arm, wrist, spin, in, the, fourth, test, at, headingley, sobers, scored, 114, and, 59, as, his, team, won, by, two, wickets, following, the, rest, of, the, world, series, he, outraged, many, in, the, west, indies, by, playing, in, a, friendly, double, wicket, tournament, in, rhodesia, in, september, 1970, in, january, 1972, in, the, third, unofficial, test, between, australia, and, the, world, xi, at, the, melbourne, cricket, ground, sobers, played, an, innings, of, 254, which, was, described, by, don, bradman, as, probably, the, greatest, exhibition, of, batting, ever, seen, in, australia, australian, captain, ian, chappell, also, rates, the, innings, as, the, best, innings, he, ever, saw, he, reached, his, century, in, 129, balls, and, after, a, rest, day, reached, 254, in, 326, balls, it, was, one, of, the, most, magnificent, innings, seen, on, the, melbourne, cricket, ground, and, his, superb, display, of, forceful, cricket, lasted, 376, minutes, and, included, two, sixes, and, 33, fours, sobers, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, these, two, unofficial, series, should, be, given, full, test, status, due, to, the, quality, of, the, players, involved, sobers, spent, several, seasons, in, english, league, cricket, having, completed, his, first, tour, of, england, with, west, indies, in, 1957, he, followed, the, advice, of, his, mentor, frank, worrell, and, became, the, professional, at, radcliffe, cricket, club, in, the, central, lancashire, league, staying, for, five, seasons, from, 1958, to, 1962, this, experience, enabled, him, to, hone, his, skills, in, varying, conditions, and, sobers, says, that, playing, in, the, league, furthered, his, cricket, education, he, enjoyed, considerable, success, at, radcliffe, in, 1961, he, achieved, a, rare, double, by, scoring, 1008, runs, and, taking, 144, wickets, his, performances, being, instrumental, in, radcliffe, winning, both, the, league, s, championship, title, and, its, supplementary, wood, cup, competition, while, he, was, engaged, at, radcliffe, sobers, underwent, emotional, trauma, after, a, road, accident, in, september, 1959, on, the, a34, near, stoke, on, trent, which, resulted, in, collie, smith, s, death, sobers, was, driving, a, car, in, which, smith, and, another, west, indian, test, player, tom, dewdney, were, passengers, smith, s, back, was, broken, by, the, collision, and, he, died, three, days, later, sobers, could, not, recall, much, about, the, crash, and, was, fined, 10, for, driving, without, due, care, and, attention, he, began, drinking, more, and, there, were, concerns, expressed, by, himself, and, others, that, the, experience, might, affect, his, cricket, career, he, got, over, the, trauma, by, deciding, that, he, would, be, letting, his, country, down, if, he, disappeared, into, the, mists, of, an, alcoholic, haze, and, he, resolved, to, play, not, just, for, garfield, sobers, but, for, collie, smith, as, well, thus, setting, himself, the, task, of, playing, for, two, men, he, recovered, well, and, after, an, outstanding, home, test, series, against, england, in, 1959, 60, he, returned, to, radcliffe, where, he, continued, as, club, professional, for, the, next, three, seasons, sobers, gives, an, insight, into, the, life, of, the, club, professional, in, his, autobiography, he, was, paid, 500, a, season, by, radcliffe, that, was, a, reasonable, wage, but, he, relied, on, matchday, collections, to, augment, it, and, a, good, performance, would, boost, the, collection, he, sometimes, received, as, much, as, 50, in, a, collection, and, that, represented, a, massive, bonus, radcliffe, placed, no, restrictions, on, him, and, when, they, had, no, game, he, could, play, as, a, guest, professional, in, other, leagues, throughout, lancashire, and, yorkshire, he, particularly, liked, playing, in, yorkshire, when, he, could, because, they, would, pay, him, 25, per, appearance, with, a, collection, on, top, if, he, did, well, after, touring, england, with, west, indies, in, 1963, he, moved, to, the, north, staffordshire, and, south, cheshire, league, in, 1964, to, play, for, norton, cricket, club, who, duly, won, the, league, title, sobers, made, 549, runs, in, 18, innings, at, 49, 90, finishing, second, in, the, league, averages, behind, only, his, amateur, brother, gerald, also, playing, for, norton, who, averaged, 50, 12, gary, sobers, did, even, better, with, the, ball, his, 97, wickets, at, 8, 38, heading, the, league, averages, 1965, saw, a, repeat, performance, with, norton, again,

61, west, indies, tour, sobers, and, his, west, indian, colleagues, wes, hall, and, rohan, kanhai, returned, to, australia, to, take, part, in, the, sheffield, shield, sobers, played, for, south, australia, and, had, an, enormous, impact, on, attendances, causing, an, 89, increase, with, gate, receipts, rising, by, two, and, a, half, times, he, topped, both, the, batting, and, bowling, averages, at, south, australia, his, best, performance, being, against, champions, new, south, wales, at, the, adelaide, oval, when, he, scored, 251, and, took, 3, 51, and, 6, 72, he, was, even, more, outstanding, in, 1963, 64, when, largely, due, to, his, efforts, south, australia, won, the, sheffield, shield, sobers, was, the, season, s, leading, runscorer, with, 973, at, 74, 84, and, the, leading, wicket, taker, with, 47, at, 28, 27, sobers, spent, three, seasons, with, south, australia, and, in, two, he, achieved, the, rare, double, of, 1000, runs, and, 50, wickets, sobers, played, intermittently, for, barbados, throughout, his, first, class, career, he, made, his, first, appearance, in, the, inaugural, season, of, the, new, shell, shield, competition, in, february, 1966, his, last, appearance, for, barbados, came, in, the, 1973, 74, shell, shield, match, against, jamaica, at, kensington, oval, at, the, end, of, the, 1967, english, cricket, season, it, was, agreed, that, each, county, club, could, immediately, sign, a, non, english, player, for, the, 1968, season, seven, clubs, approached, sobers, and, on, 14, december, 1967, nottinghamshire, announced, that, he, had, signed, for, them, and, had, been, appointed, club, captain, sobers, stated, that, although, he, had, enjoyed, his, time, in, league, cricket, he, had, a, definite, preference, for, the, first, class, game, and, he, looked, forward, to, restoring, nottinghamshire, s, fortunes, though, details, were, undisclosed, wisden, 1968, speculated, that, his, contract, would, run, for, three, years, and, be, worth, 7000, a, year, a, very, high, income, at, the, time, including, an, apartment, and, a, car, on, 31, august, 1968, sobers, became, the, first, batsman, ever, to, hit, six, sixes, in, a, single, over, of, six, consecutive, balls, in, first, class, cricket, sobers, hit, the, first, four, balls, cleanly, out, of, the, ground, but, was, caught, on, his, fifth, attempt, by, roger, davis, on, the, boundary, at, long, off, however, while, doing, so, davis, fell, on, his, back, and, landed, on, the, line, umpire, eddie, phillipson, ruled, that, davis, had, carried, the, ball, over, the, boundary, and, signalled, six, sobers, then, smashed, the, next, ball, the, sixth, ball, of, the, over, clean, over, the, east, terrace, of, the, st, helen, s, cricket, ground, as, commentator, wilf, wooller, put, it, and, he, s, done, it, he, s, done, it, and, my, goodness, it, s, gone, way, down, to, swansea, sobers, was, playing, as, captain, of, nottinghamshire, against, glamorgan, at, st, helen, s, in, swansea, the, unfortunate, bowler, was, malcolm, nash, this, tally, of, 36, runs, in, an, over, broke, a, 57, year, old, record, of, 34, runs, held, by, ted, alletson, the, ball, was, collected, from, a, garden, by, 11, year, old, richard, lewis, he, later, gave, the, ball, to, sobers, in, 1984, 85, indian, batsman, ravi, shastri, equalled, the, record, by, scoring, six, sixes, in, an, over, while, playing, for, bombay, versus, baroda, an, outstanding, all, rounder, sobers, was, left, handed, as, both, batsman, and, bowler, his, versatility, enabled, him, to, bowl, all, varieties, of, left, arm, bowling, from, spin, to, fast, medium, as, a, fielder, he, was, usually, stationed, close, to, the, wicket, but, he, was, also, a, very, capable, outfielder, in, a, 1988, interview, with, norman, may, the, great, australian, batsman, and, cricket, administrator, sir, donald, bradman, described, sobers, as, the, best, all, rounder, he, ever, saw, and, gave, this, assessment, of, his, style, and, technique, i, ve, got, no, hesitation, at, all, in, saying, that, gary, sobers, is, the, greatest, allround, cricketer, i, ever, saw, sobers, made, over, 8000, runs, for, the, west, indies, in, test, matches, at, the, splendid, average, of, 57, 7, and, only, weekes, and, headley, have, beaten, that, average, he, also, took, 235, wickets, although, his, bowling, average, of, 34, was, high, it, is, understandable, because, he, bowled, fast, with, the, new, ball, left, hand, googly, or, first, finger, spin, according, to, what, the, situation, demanded, and, this, took, away, some, of, the, accuracy, that, the, less, versatile, bowlers, developed, without, a, doubt, he, was, the, best, batsman, in, the, world, against, fast, bowling, on, top, of, that, he, was, a, superb, fielder, in, any, position, richie, benaud, described, sobers, as, the, greatest, all, round, cricketer, the, world, has, seen, benaud, wrote, sobers, was, a, brilliant, batsman, splendid, fielder, particularly, close, to, the, wicket, and, a, bowler, of, extraordinary, skill, whether, bowling, with, the, new, ball, providing, orthodox, left, arm, spin, or, over, the, wrist, spin, fred, trueman, enjoyed, a, great, rivalry, with, sobers, and, later, described, him, as, a, sublime, left, hand, batsman, who, was, one, of, the, greatest, cricketers, ever, to, have, graced, the, game, certainly, the, greatest, all, rounder, trueman, went, on, to, say, that, sobers, as, a, batsman, has, a, great, cricketing, brain, and, his, thought, processes, are, lightning, quick, c, l, r, james, when, describing, the, batsmanship, of, wilton, st, hill, commented, upon, st, hill, s, ability, to, judge, the, ball, early, in, its, flight, and, so, quickly, decide, which, stroke, to, play, in, james, s, view, only, sir, don, bradman, and, sobers, were, comparable, with, st, hill, in, having, this, capability, of, seeing, the, ball, wisden, 1969, described, the, lightning, footwork, of, sobers, as, he, got, into, position, for, his, stroke, commenting, upon, sobers, s, six, sixes, in, an, over, against, his, team, in, 1968, glamorgan, captain, tony, lewis, said, it, was, not, sheer, slogging, through, strength, but, scientific, hitting, with, every, movement, working, in, harmony, as, a, bowler, sobers, began, as, an, orthodox, left, arm, spinner, sla, and, later, developed, the, ability, to, bowl, left, arm, wrist, spin, and, googlies, sobers, could, also, operate, as, a, seamer, sometimes, using, medium, pace, but, he, was, much, more, effective, when, he, bowled, fast, with, the, new, ball, he, could, make, the, delivery, curve, late, in, flight, at, high, speed, his, action, being, a, loose, springy, run, followed, by, a, whiplash, delivery, though, he, mostly, fielded, close, to, the, wicket, sobers, was, an, exceptional, outfielder, who, was, seen, on, one, occasion, when, he, had, fielded, the, ball, on, the, boundary, to, bend, his, hand, back, almost, parallel, with, his, arm, before, flipping, the, ball, a, full, seventy, yards, to, the, wicketkeeper, following, his, success, as, captain, of, west, indies, on, the, 1966, tour, of, england, the, 1967, edition, of, wisden, cricketers, almanack, declared, that, for, sobers, the, 1966, tests, were, one, triumph, after, another, with, bat, and, ball, as, well, as, in, the, field, as, a, master, tactician, and, fantastic, catcher, close, to, the, bat, sobers, s, exploits, in, 1966, earned, him, the, media, bestowed, sobriquet, of, king, cricket, which, soon, afterwards, became, the, title, of, a, book, about, him, sobers, was, briefly, engaged, to, indian, actress, anju, mahendru, after, he, met, her, on, the, 1966, 67, tour, of, india, he, married, prudence, pru, kirby, an, australian, in, september, 1969, they, had, two, sons, matthew, and, daniel, and, an, adopted, daughter, genevieve, the, marriage, ended, in, divorce, in, 1990, after, the, couple, broke, up, in, 1984, however, sobers, acquired, dual, australian, citizenship, through, marriage, in, 1980, he, says, that, his, was, a, multi, sporting, family, who, were, all, good, at, football, basketball, table, tennis, and, tennis, his, own, favourite, sport, is, golf, and, he, has, been, an, enthusiastic, gambler, he, is, the, author, of, a, children, s, novel, about, cricket, bonaventure, and, the, flashing, blade, in, which, computer, analysis, helps, a, university, cricket, team, become, unbeatable, in, 2021, sobers, expressed, his, opposition, to, the, constitutional, change, made, by, the, government, of, barbados, to, become, a, republic, and, abolish, the, monarchy, of, barbados, in, the, 1975, new, year, honours, queen, elizabeth, ii, created, sobers, a, knight, bachelor, for, his, services, to, cricket, the, award, was, made, in, the, british, diplomatic, and, overseas, section, of, the, list, rather, than, on, the, nomination, of, the, government, of, barbados, which, had, stopped, putting, forward, recommendations, for, british, honours, this, caused, the, british, foreign, and, commonwealth, office, some, unease, as, shown, by, papers, released, by, the, national, archives, in, 2005, however, since, barbados, had, not, yet, introduced, its, own, system, of, honours, the, prime, minister, of, barbados, was, pleased, that, an, honour, would, be, forthcoming, for, sobers, the, award, was, originally, intended, to, be, made, in, the, 1975, queen, s, birthday, honours, but, since, there, was, a, royal, visit, to, barbados, planned, for, february, 1975, it, was, moved, forward, to, the, new, year, list, so, that, sobers, could, be, knighted, by, the, queen, in, person, during, the, visit, the, very, short, turnaround, between, the, decision, to, make, the, award, and, its, announcement, meant, that, the, governor, general, of, barbados, was, not, informed, of, the, award, before, the, public, announcement, which, caused, some, hurt, feelings, between, london, and, bridgetown, he, was, the, subject, of, this, is, your, life, in, 1975, when, he, was, surprised, by, eamonn, andrews, while, attending, a, reception, at, the, barbadian, high, commission, in, london, to, celebrate, his, recent, knighthood, sobers, was, made, a, national, hero, of, barbados, by, the, cabinet, of, barbados, in, 1998, and, is, thus, accorded, the, honorary, prefix, the, right,
