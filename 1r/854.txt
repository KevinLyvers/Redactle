herbert, spencer, 27, april, 1820, 8, december, 1903, was, an, english, polymath, active, as, a, philosopher, psychologist, biologist, sociologist, and, anthropologist, spencer, originated, the, expression, survival, of, the, fittest, which, he, coined, in, principles, of, biology, 1864, after, reading, charles, darwin, s, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, the, term, strongly, suggests, natural, selection, yet, spencer, saw, evolution, as, extending, into, realms, of, sociology, and, ethics, so, he, also, supported, lamarckism, spencer, developed, an, all, embracing, conception, of, evolution, as, the, progressive, development, of, the, physical, world, biological, organisms, the, human, mind, and, human, culture, and, societies, as, a, polymath, he, contributed, to, a, wide, range, of, subjects, including, ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political, theory, philosophy, literature, astronomy, biology, sociology, and, psychology, during, his, lifetime, he, achieved, tremendous, authority, mainly, in, english, speaking, academia, spencer, was, the, single, most, famous, european, intellectual, in, the, closing, decades, of, the, nineteenth, century, but, his, influence, declined, sharply, after, 1900, who, now, reads, spencer, asked, talcott, parsons, in, 1937, spencer, was, born, in, derby, england, on, 27, april, 1820, the, son, of, william, george, spencer, generally, called, george, spencer, s, father, was, a, religious, dissenter, who, drifted, from, methodism, to, quakerism, and, who, seems, to, have, transmitted, to, his, son, an, opposition, to, all, forms, of, authority, he, ran, a, school, founded, on, the, progressive, teaching, methods, of, johann, heinrich, pestalozzi, and, also, served, as, secretary, of, the, derby, philosophical, society, a, scientific, society, which, had, been, founded, in, 1783, by, erasmus, darwin, the, grandfather, of, charles, darwin, spencer, was, educated, in, empirical, science, by, his, father, while, the, members, of, the, derby, philosophical, society, introduced, him, to, pre, darwinian, concepts, of, biological, evolution, particularly, those, of, erasmus, darwin, and, jean, baptiste, lamarck, his, uncle, the, reverend, thomas, spencer, vicar, of, hinton, charterhouse, near, bath, completed, spencer, s, limited, formal, education, by, teaching, him, some, mathematics, and, physics, and, enough, latin, to, enable, him, to, translate, some, easy, texts, thomas, spencer, also, imprinted, on, his, nephew, his, own, firm, free, trade, and, anti, statist, political, views, otherwise, spencer, was, an, autodidact, who, acquired, most, of, his, knowledge, from, narrowly, focused, readings, and, conversations, with, his, friends, and, acquaintances, both, as, an, adolescent, and, as, a, young, man, spencer, found, it, difficult, to, settle, to, any, intellectual, or, professional, discipline, he, worked, as, a, civil, engineer, during, the, railway, boom, of, the, late, 1830s, while, also, devoting, much, of, his, time, to, writing, for, provincial, journals, that, were, nonconformist, in, their, religion, and, radical, in, their, politics, spencer, published, his, first, book, social, statics, 1851, whilst, working, as, sub, editor, on, the, free, trade, journal, the, economist, from, 1848, to, 1853, he, predicted, that, humanity, would, eventually, become, completely, adapted, to, the, requirements, of, living, in, society, with, the, consequential, withering, away, of, the, state, its, publisher, john, chapman, introduced, spencer, to, his, salon, which, was, attended, by, many, of, the, leading, radical, and, progressive, thinkers, of, the, capital, including, john, stuart, mill, harriet, martineau, george, henry, lewes, and, mary, ann, evans, george, eliot, with, whom, he, was, briefly, romantically, linked, spencer, himself, introduced, the, biologist, thomas, henry, huxley, who, would, later, win, fame, as, darwin, s, bulldog, and, who, remained, spencer, s, lifelong, friend, however, it, was, the, friendship, of, evans, and, lewes, that, acquainted, him, with, john, stuart, mill, s, a, system, of, logic, and, with, auguste, comte, s, positivism, and, which, set, him, on, the, road, to, his, life, s, work, he, strongly, disagreed, with, comte, spencer, s, second, book, principles, of, psychology, published, in, 1855, explored, a, physiological, basis, for, psychology, and, was, the, fruit, of, his, friendship, with, evans, and, lewes, the, book, was, founded, on, his, fundamental, assumption, that, the, human, mind, is, subject, to, natural, laws, and, that, these, can, be, discovered, within, the, framework, of, general, biology, this, permitted, the, adoption, of, a, developmental, perspective, not, merely, in, terms, of, the, individual, as, in, traditional, psychology, but, also, of, the, species, and, the, race, through, this, paradigm, spencer, aimed, to, reconcile, the, associationist, psychology, of, mill, s, logic, the, notion, that, the, human, mind, is, constructed, from, atomic, sensations, held, together, by, the, laws, of, the, association, of, ideas, with, the, apparently, more, scientific, theory, of, phrenology, which, locates, specific, mental, functions, in, specific, parts, of, the, brain, spencer, argued, that, both, these, theories, are, partial, accounts, of, the, truth, repeated, associations, of, ideas, are, embodied, in, the, formation, of, specific, strands, of, brain, tissue, and, these, can, be, passed, from, one, generation, to, the, next, by, means, of, the, lamarckian, mechanism, of, use, inheritance, the, psychology, he, believed, would, do, for, the, human, mind, what, isaac, newton, had, done, for, matter, however, the, book, was, not, initially, successful, and, the, last, of, the, 251, copies, of, its, first, edition, were, not, sold, until, june, 1861, spencer, s, interest, in, psychology, derived, from, a, more, fundamental, concern, which, was, to, establish, the, universality, of, natural, law, in, common, with, others, of, his, generation, including, the, members, of, chapman, s, salon, he, was, possessed, with, the, idea, of, demonstrating, that, it, is, possible, to, show, that, everything, in, the, universe, including, human, culture, language, and, morality, could, be, explained, by, laws, of, universal, validity, this, was, in, contrast, to, the, views, of, many, theologians, of, the, time, who, insisted, that, some, parts, of, creation, in, particular, the, human, soul, are, beyond, the, realm, of, scientific, investigation, comte, s, syst, me, de, philosophie, positive, had, been, written, with, the, ambition, of, demonstrating, the, universality, of, natural, law, and, spencer, was, to, follow, comte, in, the, scale, of, his, ambition, however, spencer, differed, from, comte, in, believing, it, is, possible, to, discover, a, single, law, of, universal, application, which, he, identified, with, progressive, development, and, was, to, call, the, principle, of, evolution, in, 1858, spencer, produced, an, outline, of, what, was, to, become, the, system, of, synthetic, philosophy, this, immense, undertaking, which, has, few, parallels, in, the, english, language, aimed, to, demonstrate, that, the, principle, of, evolution, applies, in, biology, psychology, sociology, spencer, appropriated, comte, s, term, for, the, new, discipline, and, morality, spencer, envisaged, that, this, work, of, ten, volumes, would, take, twenty, years, to, complete, in, the, end, it, took, him, twice, as, long, and, consumed, almost, all, the, rest, of, his, long, life, despite, spencer, s, early, struggles, to, establish, himself, as, a, writer, by, the, 1870s, he, had, become, the, most, famous, philosopher, of, the, age, his, works, were, widely, read, during, his, lifetime, and, by, 1869, he, was, able, to, support, himself, solely, on, the, profit, of, book, sales, and, on, income, from, his, regular, contributions, to, victorian, periodicals, which, were, collected, as, three, volumes, of, essays, his, works, were, translated, into, german, italian, spanish, french, russian, japanese, and, chinese, and, into, many, other, languages, and, he, was, offered, honours, and, awards, all, over, europe, and, north, america, he, also, became, a, member, of, the, athenaeum, an, exclusive, gentleman, s, club, in, london, open, only, to, those, distinguished, in, the, arts, and, sciences, and, the, x, club, a, dining, club, of, nine, founded, by, t, h, huxley, that, met, every, month, and, included, some, of, the, most, prominent, thinkers, of, the, victorian, age, three, of, whom, would, become, presidents, of, the, royal, society, members, included, physicist, philosopher, john, tyndall, and, darwin, s, cousin, the, banker, and, biologist, sir, john, lubbock, there, were, also, some, quite, significant, satellites, such, as, liberal, clergyman, arthur, stanley, the, dean, of, westminster, and, guests, such, as, charles, darwin, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, were, entertained, from, time, to, time, through, such, associations, spencer, had, a, strong, presence, in, the, heart, of, the, scientific, community, and, was, able, to, secure, an, influential, audience, for, his, views, the, last, decades, of, spencer, s, life, were, characterised, by, growing, disillusionment, and, loneliness, he, never, married, and, after, 1855, was, a, life, long, hypochondriac, who, complained, endlessly, of, pains, and, maladies, that, no, physician, could, diagnose, at, that, time, his, excitability, and, sensitivity, to, disagreement, handicapped, his, social, life, his, nervous, sensibility, was, extreme, a, game, of, billiards, was, enough, to, deprive, him, of, his, night, s, rest, he, had, been, looking, forward, with, pleasure, to, a, meeting, with, huxley, but, he, gave, it, up, because, there, was, a, difference, on, some, scientific, question, between, them, and, this, might, have, given, rise, to, an, argument, which, spencer, s, nerves, could, not, bear, by, the, 1890s, his, readership, had, begun, to, desert, him, while, many, of, his, closest, friends, died, and, he, had, come, to, doubt, the, confident, faith, in, progress, that, he, had, made, the, centre, piece, of, his, philosophical, system, his, later, years, were, also, ones, in, which, his, political, views, became, increasingly, conservative, whereas, social, statics, had, been, the, work, of, a, radical, democrat, who, believed, in, votes, for, women, and, even, for, children, and, in, the, nationalisation, of, the, land, to, break, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, by, the, 1880s, he, had, become, a, staunch, opponent, of, female, suffrage, and, made, common, cause, with, the, landowners, of, the, liberty, and, property, defence, league, against, what, they, saw, as, the, drift, towards, socialism, of, elements, such, as, sir, william, harcourt, within, the, administration, of, william, ewart, gladstone, largely, against, the, opinions, of, gladstone, himself, spencer, s, political, views, from, this, period, were, expressed, in, what, has, become, his, most, famous, work, the, man, versus, the, state, the, exception, to, spencer, s, growing, conservatism, was, that, he, remained, throughout, his, life, an, ardent, opponent, of, imperialism, and, militarism, his, critique, of, the, boer, war, was, especially, scathing, and, it, contributed, to, his, declining, popularity, in, britain, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1883, spencer, also, invented, a, precursor, to, the, modern, paper, clip, though, it, looked, more, like, a, modern, cotter, pin, this, binding, pin, was, distributed, by, ackermann, company, spencer, shows, drawings, of, the, pin, in, appendix, i, following, appendix, h, of, his, autobiography, along, with, published, descriptions, of, its, uses, in, 1902, shortly, before, his, death, spencer, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, which, was, assigned, to, the, german, theodor, mommsen, he, continued, writing, all, his, life, in, later, years, often, by, dictation, until, he, succumbed, to, poor, health, at, the, age, of, 83, his, ashes, are, interred, in, the, eastern, side, of, london, s, highgate, cemetery, facing, karl, marx, s, grave, at, spencer, s, funeral, the, indian, nationalist, leader, shyamji, krishna, varma, announced, a, donation, of, 1, 000, to, establish, a, lectureship, at, oxford, university, in, tribute, to, spencer, and, his, work, the, basis, for, spencer, s, appeal, to, many, of, his, generation, was, that, he, appeared, to, offer, a, ready, made, system, of, belief, which, could, substitute, for, conventional, religious, faith, at, a, time, when, orthodox, creeds, were, crumbling, under, the, advances, of, modern, science, spencer, s, philosophical, system, seemed, to, demonstrate, that, it, is, possible, to, believe, in, the, ultimate, perfection, of, humanity, on, the, basis, of, advanced, scientific, conceptions, such, as, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, and, biological, evolution, in, essence, spencer, s, philosophical, vision, was, formed, by, a, combination, of, deism, and, positivism, on, the, one, hand, he, had, imbibed, something, of, eighteenth, century, deism, from, his, father, and, other, members, of, the, derby, philosophical, society, and, from, books, like, george, combe, s, immensely, popular, the, constitution, of, man, 1828, this, treated, the, world, as, a, cosmos, of, benevolent, design, and, the, laws, of, nature, as, the, decrees, of, a, being, transcendentally, kind, natural, laws, are, thus, the, statutes, of, a, well, governed, universe, that, have, been, decreed, by, the, creator, with, the, intention, of, promoting, human, happiness, although, spencer, lost, his, christian, faith, as, a, teenager, and, later, rejected, any, anthropomorphic, conception, of, the, deity, he, nonetheless, held, fast, to, this, conception, at, an, almost, subconscious, level, at, the, same, time, however, he, owed, far, more, than, he, would, ever, acknowledge, to, positivism, in, particular, in, its, conception, of, a, philosophical, system, as, the, unification, of, the, various, branches, of, scientific, knowledge, he, also, followed, positivism, in, his, insistence, that, it, is, only, possible, to, have, genuine, knowledge, of, phenomena, and, hence, that, it, is, idle, to, speculate, about, the, nature, of, the, ultimate, reality, the, tension, between, positivism, and, his, residual, deism, ran, through, the, entire, system, of, synthetic, philosophy, spencer, followed, comte, in, aiming, for, the, unification, of, scientific, truth, it, was, in, this, sense, that, his, philosophy, aimed, to, be, synthetic, like, comte, he, was, committed, to, the, universality, of, natural, law, the, idea, that, the, laws, of, nature, apply, without, exception, to, the, organic, realm, as, much, as, to, the, inorganic, and, to, the, human, mind, as, much, as, to, the, rest, of, creation, the, first, objective, of, synthetic, philosophy, was, thus, to, demonstrate, that, there, are, no, exceptions, to, being, able, to, discover, scientific, explanations, in, the, form, of, natural, laws, of, all, the, phenomena, of, the, universe, spencer, s, volumes, on, biology, psychology, and, sociology, were, all, intended, to, demonstrate, the, existence, of, natural, laws, in, these, specific, disciplines, even, in, his, writings, on, ethics, he, held, that, it, is, possible, to, discover, laws, of, morality, that, have, the, status, of, laws, of, nature, while, still, having, normative, content, a, conception, which, can, be, traced, to, george, combe, s, constitution, of, man, the, second, objective, of, the, synthetic, philosophy, was, to, show, that, these, same, laws, lead, inexorably, to, progress, in, contrast, to, comte, who, stressed, only, the, unity, of, the, scientific, method, spencer, sought, the, unification, of, scientific, knowledge, in, the, form, of, the, reduction, of, all, natural, laws, to, one, fundamental, law, the, law, of, evolution, in, this, respect, he, followed, the, model, laid, down, by, the, edinburgh, publisher, robert, chambers, in, his, anonymous, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, 1844, although, often, dismissed, as, a, lightweight, forerunner, of, charles, darwin, s, the, origin, of, species, chambers, book, was, in, reality, a, programme, for, the, unification, of, science, which, aimed, to, show, that, laplace, s, nebular, hypothesis, for, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, and, lamarck, s, theory, of, species, transformation, are, both, instances, of, one, magnificent, generalisation, of, progressive, development, lewes, phrase, chambers, was, associated, with, chapman, s, salon, and, his, work, served, as, the, unacknowledged, template, for, the, synthetic, philosophy, spencer, first, articulated, his, evolutionary, perspective, in, his, essay, progress, its, law, and, cause, published, in, chapman, s, westminster, review, in, 1857, and, which, later, formed, the, basis, of, the, first, principles, of, a, new, system, of, philosophy, 1862, in, it, he, expounded, a, theory, of, evolution, which, combines, insights, from, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, essay, the, theory, of, life, itself, derivative, from, friedrich, von, schelling, s, naturphilosophie, with, a, generalisation, of, von, baer, s, law, of, embryological, development, spencer, posited, that, all, structures, in, the, universe, develop, from, a, simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity, to, a, complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, while, undergoing, increasing, integration, of, the, differentiated, parts, this, evolutionary, process, can, be, observed, spencer, believed, throughout, the, cosmos, it, is, a, universal, law, applying, to, the, stars, and, galaxies, and, to, biological, organisms, and, to, human, social, organisation, and, to, the, human, mind, it, differed, from, other, scientific, laws, only, in, its, greater, generality, and, the, laws, of, the, special, sciences, can, be, shown, to, be, illustrations, of, this, principle, the, principles, described, by, herbert, spencer, received, a, variety, of, interpretations, bertrand, russell, stated, in, a, letter, to, beatrice, webb, in, 1923, i, don, t, know, whether, was, ever, made, to, realize, the, implications, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, if, so, he, may, well, be, upset, the, law, says, that, everything, tends, to, uniformity, and, a, dead, level, diminishing, not, increasing, heterogeneity, spencer, s, attempt, to, explain, the, evolution, of, complexity, was, radically, different, from, that, of, darwin, s, origin, of, species, which, was, published, two, years, later, spencer, is, often, quite, erroneously, believed, to, have, merely, appropriated, and, generalised, darwin, s, work, on, natural, selection, but, although, after, reading, darwin, s, work, he, coined, the, phrase, survival, of, the, fittest, as, his, own, term, for, darwin, s, concept, and, is, often, misrepresented, as, a, thinker, who, merely, applied, the, darwinian, theory, to, society, he, only, grudgingly, incorporated, natural, selection, into, his, preexisting, overall, system, the, primary, mechanism, of, species, transformation, that, he, recognised, was, lamarckian, use, inheritance, which, posited, that, organs, are, developed, or, are, diminished, by, use, or, disuse, and, that, the, resulting, changes, may, be, transmitted, to, future, generations, spencer, believed, that, this, evolutionary, mechanism, is, also, necessary, to, explain, higher, evolution, especially, the, social, development, of, humanity, moreover, in, contrast, to, darwin, he, held, that, evolution, has, a, direction, and, an, end, point, the, attainment, of, a, final, state, of, equilibrium, he, tried, to, apply, the, theory, of, biological, evolution, to, sociology, he, proposed, that, society, is, the, product, of, change, from, lower, to, higher, forms, just, as, in, the, theory, of, biological, evolution, the, lowest, forms, of, life, are, said, to, be, evolving, into, higher, forms, spencer, claimed, that, man, s, mind, has, evolved, in, the, same, way, from, the, simple, automatic, responses, of, lower, animals, to, the, process, of, reasoning, in, the, thinking, man, spencer, believed, in, two, kinds, of, knowledge, knowledge, gained, by, the, individual, and, knowledge, gained, by, the, race, according, to, his, thinking, intuition, or, knowledge, learned, unconsciously, is, the, inherited, experience, of, the, race, spencer, in, his, book, principles, of, biology, 1864, proposed, a, pangenesis, theory, that, involves, physiological, units, assumed, to, be, related, to, specific, body, parts, and, responsible, for, the, transmission, of, characteristics, to, offspring, these, hypothetical, hereditary, units, are, similar, to, darwin, s, gemmules, spencer, read, with, excitement, the, original, positivist, sociology, of, auguste, comte, a, philosopher, of, science, comte, had, proposed, a, theory, of, sociocultural, evolution, that, society, progresses, by, a, general, law, of, three, stages, writing, after, various, developments, in, biology, however, spencer, rejected, what, he, regarded, as, the, ideological, aspects, of, comte, s, positivism, attempting, to, reformulate, social, science, in, terms, of, his, principle, of, evolution, which, he, applied, to, the, biological, psychological, and, sociological, aspects, of, the, universe, spencer, is, also, generally, credited, as, the, first, to, use, the, term, social, structure, given, the, primacy, which, spencer, placed, on, evolution, his, sociology, might, be, described, as, social, darwinism, mixed, with, lamarckism, however, despite, its, popularity, this, view, of, spencer, s, sociology, is, mistaken, while, his, political, and, ethical, writings, have, themes, consistent, with, social, darwinism, such, themes, are, absent, in, spencer, s, sociological, works, which, focus, on, how, processes, of, societal, growth, and, differentiation, lead, to, changing, degrees, of, complexity, in, social, organization, the, evolutionary, progression, from, simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity, to, complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, is, exemplified, spencer, argued, by, the, development, of, society, he, developed, a, theory, of, two, types, of, society, the, militant, and, the, industrial, which, corresponded, to, this, evolutionary, progression, militant, society, structured, around, relationships, of, hierarchy, and, obedience, is, simple, and, undifferentiated, industrial, society, based, on, voluntary, contractually, assumed, social, obligations, is, complex, and, differentiated, society, which, spencer, conceptualised, as, a, social, organism, evolved, from, the, simpler, state, to, the, more, complex, according, to, the, universal, law, of, evolution, moreover, industrial, society, is, the, direct, descendant, of, the, ideal, society, developed, in, social, statics, although, spencer, now, equivocated, over, whether, the, evolution, of, society, would, result, in, anarchism, as, he, had, first, believed, or, whether, it, points, to, a, continued, role, for, the, state, albeit, one, reduced, to, the, minimal, functions, of, the, enforcement, of, contracts, and, external, defence, though, spencer, made, some, valuable, contributions, to, early, sociology, not, least, in, his, influence, on, structural, functionalism, his, attempt, to, introduce, lamarckian, or, darwinian, ideas, into, the, realm, of, sociology, was, unsuccessful, it, was, considered, by, many, furthermore, to, be, actively, dangerous, hermeneuticians, of, the, period, such, as, wilhelm, dilthey, would, pioneer, the, distinction, between, the, natural, sciences, naturwissenschaften, and, human, sciences, geisteswissenschaften, in, the, united, states, the, sociologist, lester, frank, ward, who, would, be, elected, as, the, first, president, of, the, american, sociological, association, launched, a, relentless, attack, on, spencer, s, theories, of, laissez, faire, and, political, ethics, although, ward, admired, much, of, spencer, s, work, he, believed, that, spencer, s, prior, political, biases, had, distorted, his, thought, and, had, led, him, astray, in, the, 1890s, mile, durkheim, established, formal, academic, sociology, with, a, firm, emphasis, on, practical, social, research, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, generation, of, german, sociologists, most, notably, max, weber, had, presented, methodological, antipositivism, however, spencer, s, theories, of, laissez, faire, survival, of, the, fittest, and, minimal, human, interference, in, the, processes, of, natural, law, had, an, enduring, and, even, increasing, appeal, in, the, social, science, fields, of, economics, and, political, science, and, one, writer, has, recently, made, the, case, for, spencer, s, importance, for, a, sociology, that, must, learn, to, take, energy, in, society, seriously, spencer, predicted, in, his, first, book, that, the, endpoint, of, the, evolutionary, process, will, be, the, creation, of, the, perfect, man, in, the, perfect, society, with, human, beings, becoming, completely, adapted, to, social, life, the, chief, difference, between, spencer, s, earlier, and, later, conceptions, of, this, process, is, the, evolutionary, timescale, involved, the, psychological, and, hence, also, the, moral, constitution, which, has, been, bequeathed, to, the, present, generation, by, our, ancestors, and, which, we, in, turn, will, hand, on, to, future, generations, is, in, the, process, of, gradual, adaptation, to, the, requirements, of, living, in, society, for, example, aggression, is, a, survival, instinct, which, was, necessary, in, the, primitive, conditions, of, life, but, is, maladaptive, in, advanced, societies, because, human, instincts, have, a, specific, location, in, strands, of, brain, tissue, they, are, subject, to, the, lamarckian, mechanism, of, use, inheritance, so, that, gradual, modifications, could, be, transmitted, to, future, generations, over, the, course, of, many, generations, the, evolutionary, process, will, ensure, that, human, beings, will, become, less, aggressive, and, increasingly, altruistic, leading, eventually, to, a, perfect, society, in, which, no, one, would, cause, another, person, pain, however, spencer, held, for, evolution, to, produce, the, perfect, individual, it, is, necessary, for, present, and, future, generations, to, experience, the, natural, consequences, of, their, conduct, only, in, this, way, will, individuals, have, the, incentives, required, to, work, on, self, improvement, and, thus, to, hand, an, improved, moral, constitution, to, their, descendants, hence, anything, that, interferes, with, the, natural, relationship, of, conduct, and, consequence, was, to, be, resisted, and, this, included, the, use, of, the, coercive, power, of, the, state, to, relieve, poverty, to, provide, public, education, or, to, require, compulsory, vaccination, although, charitable, giving, is, to, be, encouraged, even, it, has, to, be, limited, by, the, consideration, that, suffering, is, frequently, the, result, of, individuals, receiving, the, consequences, of, their, actions, hence, too, much, individual, benevolence, directed, to, the, undeserving, poor, would, break, the, link, between, conduct, and, consequence, that, spencer, considered, fundamental, to, ensuring, that, humanity, continues, to, evolve, to, a, higher, level, of, development, spencer, adopted, a, utilitarian, standard, of, ultimate, value, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, and, the, culmination, of, the, evolutionary, process, will, be, the, maximization, of, utility, in, the, perfect, society, individuals, would, not, only, derive, pleasure, from, the, exercise, of, altruism, positive, beneficence, but, would, aim, to, avoid, inflicting, pain, on, others, negative, beneficence, they, would, also, instinctively, respect, the, rights, of, others, leading, to, the, universal, observance, of, the, principle, of, justice, each, person, had, the, right, to, a, maximum, amount, of, liberty, that, was, compatible, with, a, like, liberty, in, others, liberty, is, interpreted, to, mean, the, absence, of, coercion, and, is, closely, connected, to, the, right, to, private, property, spencer, termed, this, code, of, conduct, absolute, ethics, which, provided, a, scientifically, grounded, moral, system, that, could, substitute, for, the, supernaturally, based, ethical, systems, of, the, past, however, he, recognized, that, our, inherited, moral, constitution, does, not, currently, permit, us, to, behave, in, full, compliance, with, the, code, of, absolute, ethics, and, for, this, reason, we, need, a, code, of, relative, ethics, which, takes, into, account, the, distorting, factors, of, our, present, imperfections, spencer, s, distinctive, view, of, musicology, was, also, related, to, his, ethics, spencer, thought, that, the, origin, of, music, is, to, be, found, in, impassioned, oratory, speakers, have, persuasive, effect, not, only, by, the, reasoning, of, their, words, but, by, their, cadence, and, tone, the, musical, qualities, of, their, voice, serve, as, the, commentary, of, the, emotions, upon, the, propositions, of, the, intellect, as, spencer, put, it, music, conceived, as, the, heightened, development, of, this, characteristic, of, speech, makes, a, contribution, to, the, ethical, education, and, progress, of, the, species, the, strange, capacity, which, we, have, for, being, affected, by, melody, and, harmony, may, be, taken, to, imply, both, that, it, is, within, the, possibilities, of, our, nature, to, realize, those, intenser, delights, they, dimly, suggest, and, that, they, are, in, some, way, concerned, in, the, realization, of, them, if, so, the, power, and, the, meaning, of, music, become, comprehensible, but, otherwise, they, are, a, mystery, spencer, s, last, years, were, characterized, by, a, collapse, of, his, initial, optimism, replaced, instead, by, a, pessimism, regarding, the, future, of, mankind, nevertheless, he, devoted, much, of, his, efforts, to, reinforcing, his, arguments, and, preventing, the, misinterpretation, of, his, monumental, theory, of, non, interference, spencer, s, reputation, among, the, victorians, owed, a, great, deal, to, his, agnosticism, he, rejected, theology, as, representing, the, impiety, of, the, pious, he, was, to, gain, much, notoriety, from, his, repudiation, of, traditional, religion, and, was, frequently, condemned, by, religious, thinkers, for, allegedly, advocating, atheism, and, materialism, nonetheless, unlike, thomas, henry, huxley, whose, agnosticism, was, a, militant, creed, directed, at, the, unpardonable, sin, of, faith, in, adrian, desmond, s, phrase, spencer, insisted, that, he, was, not, concerned, with, undermining, religion, in, the, name, of, science, but, to, bring, about, a, reconciliation, of, the, two, the, following, argument, is, a, summary, of, part, 1, of, his, first, principles, 2nd, ed, 1867, starting, either, from, religious, belief, or, from, science, spencer, argued, we, are, ultimately, driven, to, accept, certain, indispensable, but, literally, inconceivable, notions, whether, we, are, concerned, with, a, creator, or, the, substratum, which, underlies, our, experience, of, phenomena, we, can, frame, no, conception, of, it, therefore, spencer, concluded, that, religion, and, science, agree, in, the, supreme, truth, that, human, understanding, is, only, capable, of, relative, knowledge, this, is, the, case, since, owing, to, the, inherent, limitations, of, the, human, mind, it, is, only, possible, to, obtain, knowledge, of, phenomena, not, of, the, reality, the, absolute, underlying, phenomena, hence, both, science, and, religion, must, come, to, recognise, as, the, most, certain, of, all, facts, that, the, power, which, the, universe, manifests, to, us, is, utterly, inscrutable, he, called, this, awareness, of, the, unknowable, and, he, presented, worship, of, the, unknowable, as, capable, of, being, a, positive, faith, which, could, substitute, for, conventional, religion, indeed, he, thought, that, the, unknowable, represents, the, ultimate, stage, in, the, evolution, of, religion, the, final, elimination, of, its, last, anthropomorphic, vestiges, spencerian, views, in, 21st, century, circulation, derive, from, his, political, theories, and, memorable, attacks, on, the, reform, movements, of, the, late, 19th, century, he, has, been, claimed, as, a, precursor, by, right, libertarians, and, anarcho, capitalists, austrian, school, economist, murray, rothbard, called, social, statics, the, greatest, single, work, of, libertarian, political, philosophy, ever, written, spencer, argued, that, the, state, is, not, an, essential, institution, and, that, it, will, decay, as, a, voluntary, market, organisation, comes, to, replace, the, coercive, aspects, of, the, state, he, also, argued, that, the, individual, has, a, right, to, ignore, the, state, as, a, result, of, this, perspective, spencer, was, harshly, critical, of, patriotism, in, response, to, being, told, that, british, troops, were, in, danger, during, the, second, afghan, war, 1878, 1880, he, replied, when, men, hire, themselves, out, to, shoot, other, men, to, order, asking, nothing, about, the, justice, of, their, cause, i, don, t, care, if, they, are, shot, themselves, politics, in, late, victorian, britain, moved, in, directions, that, spencer, disliked, and, his, arguments, provided, so, much, ammunition, for, conservatives, and, individualists, in, europe, and, america, that, they, are, still, in, use, in, the, 21st, century, the, expression, there, is, no, alternative, tina, made, famous, by, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, may, be, traced, to, its, emphatic, use, by, spencer, by, the, 1880s, he, was, denouncing, the, new, toryism, that, is, the, social, reformist, wing, of, the, liberal, party, the, wing, to, some, extent, hostile, to, prime, minister, william, ewart, gladstone, this, faction, of, the, liberal, party, spencer, compared, to, the, interventionist, toryism, of, such, people, as, the, former, conservative, party, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, in, the, man, versus, the, state, 1884, he, attacked, gladstone, and, the, liberal, party, for, losing, its, proper, mission, they, should, be, defending, personal, liberty, he, said, and, instead, promoting, paternalist, social, legislation, what, gladstone, himself, called, construction, an, element, in, the, modern, liberal, party, that, he, opposed, spencer, denounced, irish, land, reform, compulsory, education, laws, to, regulate, safety, at, work, prohibition, and, temperance, laws, tax, funded, libraries, and, welfare, reforms, his, main, objections, were, threefold, the, use, of, the, coercive, powers, of, the, government, the, discouragement, given, to, voluntary, self, improvement, and, the, disregard, of, the, laws, of, life, the, reforms, he, said, were, tantamount, to, socialism, which, he, said, was, about, the, same, as, slavery, in, terms, of, limiting, human, freedom, spencer, vehemently, attacked, the, widespread, enthusiasm, for, the, annexation, of, colonies, and, imperial, expansion, which, subverted, all, he, had, predicted, about, evolutionary, progress, from, militant, to, industrial, societies, and, states, spencer, anticipated, many, of, the, analytical, standpoints, of, later, right, libertarian, theorists, such, as, friedrich, hayek, especially, in, his, law, of, equal, liberty, his, insistence, on, the, limits, to, predictive, knowledge, his, model, of, spontaneous, social, order, and, his, warnings, about, the, unintended, consequences, of, collectivist, social, reforms, while, often, caricatured, as, ultra, conservative, spencer, had, been, more, radical, or, left, libertarian, earlier, in, his, career, opposing, private, property, in, land, and, claiming, that, each, person, has, a, latent, claim, to, participate, in, the, use, of, the, earth, views, that, influenced, georgism, calling, himself, a, radical, feminist, and, advocating, the, organisation, of, trade, unions, as, a, bulwark, against, exploitation, by, bosses, and, favoured, an, economy, organised, primarily, in, free, worker, co, operatives, as, a, replacement, for, wage, labor, although, he, retained, support, for, unions, his, views, on, the, other, issues, had, changed, by, the, 1880s, he, came, to, predict, that, social, welfare, programmes, would, eventually, lead, to, the, socialisation, of, the, means, of, production, saying, all, socialism, is, slavery, spencer, defined, a, slave, as, a, person, who, labours, under, coercion, to, satisfy, another, s, desires, and, believed, that, under, socialism, or, communism, the, individual, would, be, enslaved, to, the, whole, community, rather, than, to, a, particular, master, and, it, means, not, whether, his, master, is, a, single, person, or, society, for, many, the, name, of, herbert, spencer, is, virtually, synonymous, with, social, darwinism, a, social, theory, that, applies, the, law, of, the, survival, of, the, fittest, to, society, and, is, integrally, related, to, the, nineteenth, century, rise, in, scientific, racism, in, his, famed, work, social, statics, 1850, he, argued, that, imperialism, had, served, civilization, by, clearing, the, inferior, races, off, the, earth, the, forces, which, are, working, out, the, great, scheme, of, perfect, happiness, taking, no, account, of, incidental, suffering, exterminate, such, sections, of, mankind, as, stand, in, their, way, be, he, human, or, be, he, brute, the, hindrance, must, be, got, rid, of, yet, in, the, same, work, spencer, goes, on, to, say, that, the, incidental, evolutionary, benefits, derived, from, such, barbarous, practices, do, not, serve, as, justifications, for, them, going, forward, spencer, s, association, with, social, darwinism, might, have, its, origin, in, a, specific, interpretation, of, his, support, for, competition, whereas, in, biology, the, competition, of, various, organisms, can, result, in, the, death, of, a, species, or, organism, the, kind, of, competition, spencer, advocated, is, closer, to, the, one, used, by, economists, where, competing, individuals, or, firms, improve, the, well, being, of, the, rest, of, society, spencer, viewed, private, charity, positively, encouraging, both, voluntary, association, and, informal, care, to, aid, those, in, need, rather, than, relying, on, government, bureaucracy, or, force, he, further, recommended, that, private, charitable, efforts, would, be, wise, to, avoid, encouraging, the, formation, of, new, dependent, families, by, those, unable, to, support, themselves, without, charity, focusing, on, the, form, as, well, as, the, content, of, spencer, s, synthetic, philosophy, one, writer, has, identified, it, as, the, paradigmatic, case, of, social, darwinism, understood, as, a, politically, motivated, metaphysic, very, different, in, both, form, and, motivation, from, darwinist, science, in, a, letter, to, the, japanese, government, regarding, intermarriage, with, westerners, spencer, stated, that, if, you, mix, the, constitution, of, two, widely, divergent, varieties, which, have, severally, become, adapted, to, widely, divergent, modes, of, life, you, get, a, constitution, which, is, adapted, to, the, mode, of, life, of, neither, a, constitution, which, will, not, work, properly, he, goes, on, to, say, that, america, has, failed, to, limit, the, immigration, of, chinese, and, restrict, their, contact, especially, sexual, with, the, presumed, european, stock, he, states, if, they, mix, they, must, form, a, bad, hybrid, regarding, the, issue, of, chinese, and, ethnically, european, americans, spencer, ends, his, letter, with, the, following, blanket, statement, against, all, immigration, in, either, case, supposing, the, immigration, to, be, large, immense, social, mischief, must, arise, and, eventually, social, disorganization, the, same, thing, will, happen, if, there, should, be, any, considerable, mixture, of, european, or, american, races, with, the, japanese, while, most, philosophers, fail, to, achieve, much, of, a, following, outside, the, academy, of, their, professional, peers, by, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, spencer, had, achieved, an, unparalleled, popularity, as, the, sheer, volume, of, his, sales, indicate, he, was, perhaps, the, only, philosopher, in, history, to, sell, over, a, million, copies, of, his, works, during, his, own, lifetime, in, the, united, states, where, pirated, editions, were, still, commonplace, his, authorised, publisher, appleton, sold, 368, 755, copies, between, 1860, and, 1903, this, figure, did, not, differ, much, from, his, sales, in, his, native, britain, and, once, editions, in, the, rest, of, the, world, are, added, in, the, figure, of, a, million, copies, seems, like, a, conservative, estimate, as, william, james, remarked, spencer, enlarged, the, imagination, and, set, free, the, speculative, mind, of, countless, doctors, engineers, and, lawyers, of, many, physicists, and, chemists, and, of, thoughtful, laymen, generally, the, aspect, of, his, thought, that, emphasised, individual, self, improvement, found, a, ready, audience, in, the, skilled, working, class, spencer, s, influence, among, leaders, of, thought, was, also, immense, though, it, was, most, often, expressed, in, terms, of, their, reaction, to, and, repudiation, of, his, ideas, as, his, american, follower, john, fiske, observed, spencer, s, ideas, were, to, be, found, running, like, the, weft, through, all, the, warp, of, victorian, thought, such, varied, thinkers, as, henry, sidgwick, t, h, green, g, e, moore, william, james, henri, bergson, and, mile, durkheim, defined, their, ideas, in, relation, to, his, durkheim, s, division, of, labour, in, society, is, to, a, very, large, extent, an, extended, debate, with, spencer, from, whose, sociology, many, commentators, now, agree, durkheim, borrowed, extensively, in, post, 1863, uprising, poland, many, of, spencer, s, ideas, became, integral, to, the, dominant, fin, de, si, cle, ideology, polish, positivism, the, leading, polish, writer, of, the, period, boles, aw, prus, hailed, spencer, as, the, aristotle, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, adopted, spencer, s, metaphor, of, society, as, organism, giving, it, a, striking, poetic, presentation, in, his, 1884, micro, story, mold, of, the, earth, and, highlighting, the, concept, in, the, introduction, to, his, most, universal, novel, pharaoh, 1895, the, early, 20th, century, was, hostile, to, spencer, soon, after, his, death, his, philosophical, reputation, went, into, a, sharp, decline, half, a, century, after, his, death, his, work, was, dismissed, as, a, parody, of, philosophy, and, the, historian, richard, hofstadter, called, him, the, metaphysician, of, the, homemade, intellectual, and, the, prophet, of, the, cracker, barrel, agnostic, nonetheless, spencer, s, thought, had, penetrated, so, deeply, into, the, victorian, age, that, his, influence, did, not, disappear, entirely, in, recent, years, much, more, positive, estimates, have, appeared, as, well, as, a, still, highly, negative, estimate, despite, his, reputation, as, a, social, darwinist, spencer, s, political, thought, has, been, open, to, multiple, interpretations, his, political, philosophy, could, both, provide, inspiration, to, those, who, believed, that, individuals, were, masters, of, their, fate, who, should, brook, no, interference, from, a, meddling, state, and, those, who, believed, that, social, development, required, a, strong, central, authority, in, lochner, v, new, york, conservative, justices, of, the, united, states, supreme, court, could, find, inspiration, in, spencer, s, writings, for, striking, down, a, new, york, law, limiting, the, number, of, hours, a, baker, could, work, during, the, week, on, the, ground, that, this, law, restricted, liberty, of, contract, arguing, against, the, majority, s, holding, that, a, right, to, free, contract, is, implicit, in, the, due, process, clause, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, wrote, the, fourteenth, amendment, does, not, enact, mr, herbert, spencer, s, social, statics, spencer, has, also, been, described, as, a, quasi, anarchist, as, well, as, an, outright, anarchist, marxist, theorist, georgi, plekhanov, in, his, 1909, book, anarchism, and, socialism, labelled, spencer, a, conservative, anarchist, spencer, s, work, has, frequently, been, seen, as, a, model, for, later, libertarian, thinkers, such, as, robert, nozick, and, he, continues, to, be, read, and, is, often, invoked, by, libertarians, on, issues, concerning, the, function, of, government, and, the, fundamental, character, of, individual, rights, spencer, s, ideas, also, became, very, influential, in, china, and, japan, largely, because, he, appealed, to, the, reformers, desire, to, establish, a, strong, nation, state, with, which, to, compete, with, the, western, powers, his, thought, was, introduced, by, the, chinese, scholar, yen, fu, who, saw, his, writings, as, a, prescription, for, the, reform, of, the, qing, state, spencerism, was, so, influential, in, china, that, it, was, synthesized, into, the, chinese, translation, of, the, origin, of, species, in, which, darwin, s, branching, view, of, evolution, was, converted, into, a, linear, progressive, one, spencer, also, influenced, the, japanese, westernizer, tokutomi, soho, who, believed, that, japan, was, on, the, verge, of, transitioning, from, a, militant, society, to, an, industrial, society, and, needed, to, quickly, jettison, all, things, japanese, and, take, up, western, ethics, and, learning, he, also, corresponded, with, kaneko, kentaro, warning, him, of, the, dangers, of, imperialism, savarkar, writes, in, his, inside, the, enemy, camp, about, reading, all, of, spencer, s, works, of, his, great, interest, in, them, of, their, translation, into, marathi, and, their, influence, on, the, likes, of, tilak, and, agarkar, and, the, affectionate, sobriquet, given, to, him, in, maharashtra, harbhat, pendse, spencer, greatly, influenced, literature, and, rhetoric, his, 1852, essay, the, philosophy, of, style, explored, a, growing, trend, of, formalist, approaches, to, writing, highly, focused, on, the, proper, placement, and, ordering, of, the, parts, of, an, english, sentence, he, created, a, guide, for, effective, composition, spencer, aimed, to, free, prose, writing, from, as, much, friction, and, inertia, as, possible, so, that, the, reader, would, not, be, slowed, by, strenuous, deliberations, concerning, the, proper, context, and, meaning, of, a, sentence, spencer, argued, that, writers, should, aim, to, so, present, ideas, that, they, may, be, apprehended, with, the, least, possible, mental, effort, by, the, reader, he, argued, that, by, making, the, meaning, as, readily, accessible, as, possible, the, writer, would, achieve, the, greatest, possible, communicative, efficiency, this, was, accomplished, according, to, spencer, by, placing, all, the, subordinate, clauses, objects, and, phrases, before, the, subject, of, a, sentence, so, that, when, readers, reached, the, subject, they, had, all, the, information, they, needed, to, completely, perceive, its, significance, while, the, overall, influence, that, the, philosophy, of, style, had, on, the, field, of, rhetoric, was, not, as, far, reaching, as, his, contribution, to, other, fields, spencer, s, voice, lent, authoritative, support, to, formalist, views, of, rhetoric, spencer, influenced, literature, inasmuch, as, many, novelists, and, short, story, authors, came, to, address, his, ideas, in, their, work, spencer, was, referenced, by, george, eliot, leo, tolstoy, machado, de, assis, thomas, hardy, boles, aw, prus, george, bernard, shaw, abraham, cahan, richard, austin, freeman, d, h, lawrence, and, jorge, luis, borges, arnold, bennett, greatly, praised, first, principles, and, the, influence, it, had, on, bennett, may, be, seen, in, his, many, novels, jack, london, went, so, far, as, to, create, a, character, martin, eden, a, staunch, spencerian, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, character, of, vershinin, in, anton, chekhov, s, play, the, three, sisters, is, a, dedicated, spencerian, h, g, wells, used, spencer, s, ideas, as, a, theme, in, his, novella, the, time, machine, employing, them, to, explain, the, evolution, of, man, into, two, species, it, is, perhaps, the, best, testimony, to, the, influence, of, spencer, s, beliefs, and, writings, that, his, reach, was, so, diverse, he, influenced, not, only, the, administrators, who, shaped, their, societies, inner, workings, but, also, the, artists, who, helped, shape, those, societies, ideals, and, beliefs, in, rudyard, kipling, s, novel, kim, the, anglophile, bengali, spy, hurree, babu, admires, herbert, spencer, and, quotes, him, to, comic, effect, they, are, of, course, dematerialised, phenomena, spencer, says, i, am, good, enough, herbert, spencerian, i, trust, to, meet, little, thing, like, death, which, is, all, in, my, fate, you, know, he, thanked, all, the, gods, of, hindustan, and, herbert, spencer, that, there, remained, some, valuables, to, steal, upton, sinclair, in, one, clear, call, 1948, quips, that, huxley, said, that, herbert, spencer, s, idea, of, a, tragedy, was, a, generalization, killed, by, a, fact, essay, collections, biographical, sources
