theodoric, or, theoderic, the, great, 454, 30, august, 526, also, called, theodoric, the, amal, was, king, of, the, ostrogoths, 475, 526, and, ruler, of, the, independent, ostrogothic, kingdom, of, italy, between, 493, and, 526, regent, of, the, visigoths, 511, 526, and, a, patrician, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, as, ruler, of, the, combined, gothic, realms, theodoric, controlled, an, empire, stretching, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, adriatic, sea, though, theodoric, himself, only, used, the, title, king, rex, some, scholars, characterize, him, as, a, western, roman, emperor, in, all, but, name, since, he, ruled, a, large, part, of, the, former, western, roman, empire, described, as, a, res, publica, had, received, the, former, western, imperial, regalia, from, constantinople, in, 497, which, he, used, was, referred, to, by, the, imperial, title, princeps, by, the, italian, aristocracy, and, exercised, imperial, powers, recognized, in, the, east, such, as, naming, consuls, as, a, young, child, of, an, ostrogothic, nobleman, theodoric, was, taken, as, a, hostage, to, constantinople, where, he, spent, his, formative, years, and, received, an, east, roman, education, paideia, theodoric, returned, to, pannonia, around, 470, and, throughout, the, 470s, he, campaigned, against, the, sarmatians, and, competed, for, influence, among, the, goths, of, the, roman, balkans, gaining, recognition, as, king, in, 471, the, emperor, zeno, made, him, a, commander, of, the, eastern, roman, forces, in, 483, and, consul, in, 484, nevertheless, theodoric, remained, in, constant, hostilities, with, the, emperor, and, frequently, raided, east, roman, territory, at, the, behest, of, zeno, in, 489, theodoric, attacked, odoacer, the, king, of, italy, emerging, victorious, in, 493, as, the, new, ruler, of, italy, he, upheld, a, roman, legal, administration, and, scholarly, culture, while, promoting, a, major, building, program, across, italy, in, 505, he, expanded, into, the, balkans, and, by, 511, he, had, brought, the, visigothic, kingdom, of, spain, under, his, direct, control, and, established, hegemony, over, the, burgundian, and, vandal, kingdoms, theodoric, died, in, 526, and, was, buried, in, a, grand, mausoleum, in, ravenna, he, lived, on, as, the, figure, dietrich, von, bern, in, germanic, heroic, legend, theodoric, was, born, in, ad, 454, in, pannonia, on, the, banks, of, the, neusiedler, see, near, carnuntum, the, son, of, king, theodemir, a, germanic, amali, nobleman, and, his, concubine, ereleuva, this, was, just, a, year, after, the, ostrogoths, had, thrown, off, nearly, a, century, of, domination, by, the, huns, to, this, end, historian, hans, ulrich, wiemer, states, that, theodoric, s, childhood, was, spent, at, a, time, of, violent, conflicts, between, non, roman, groups, attempting, to, fill, the, power, vacuum, created, by, the, collapse, of, attila, s, empire, his, gothic, name, which, is, reconstructed, by, linguists, as, iudareiks, translates, into, people, king, or, ruler, of, the, people, in, 461, when, theodoric, was, seven, or, eight, years, of, age, he, was, taken, hostage, in, constantinople, to, secure, the, ostrogoths, compliance, with, a, treaty, theodemir, had, concluded, with, the, augustus, leo, i, ruled, 457, 474, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, the, pannonian, goths, were, required, to, surrender, a, hostage, of, royal, descent, to, the, emperor, s, court, in, this, case, that, hostage, was, theodoric, the, treaty, also, secured, a, payment, to, constantinople, of, some, 300, pounds, worth, of, gold, each, year, theodoric, was, well, educated, by, constantinople, s, best, teachers, his, status, made, him, valuable, since, the, amal, family, from, which, he, came, as, told, by, theodoric, allegedly, ruled, half, of, all, goths, since, the, third, century, ad, historian, peter, heather, argues, that, theodoric, s, claims, were, likely, self, aggrandizing, propaganda, and, that, the, amal, dynasty, was, more, limited, than, modern, commentators, presume, until, 469, theodoric, remained, in, constantinople, where, he, spent, formative, years, catching, up, on, all, the, romanitas, it, had, taken, generations, of, visigothic, balthi, to, acquire, theodoric, was, treated, with, favor, by, the, emperor, leo, i, he, learned, to, read, write, and, perform, arithmetic, while, in, captivity, in, the, eastern, empire, when, leo, heard, that, his, imperial, army, was, retreating, from, the, goths, near, pannonia, he, sent, theodoric, home, with, gifts, and, no, promises, of, any, commitments, on, his, return, in, 469, 470, theodoric, assumed, leadership, over, the, gothic, regions, previously, ruled, by, his, uncle, valamir, while, his, father, became, king, not, long, afterwards, near, singidunum, modern, belgrade, in, upper, moesia, the, tisza, sarmatian, king, babai, had, extended, his, authority, at, constantinople, s, expense, legitimizing, his, position, as, a, warrior, theodoric, crossed, the, danube, with, six, thousand, warriors, defeated, the, sarmatians, and, killed, babai, this, moment, likely, crystallized, his, position, and, marked, the, beginning, of, his, kingship, despite, not, actually, having, yet, assumed, the, throne, perhaps, to, assert, his, authority, as, an, amali, prince, theodoric, kept, the, conquered, area, of, singidunum, for, himself, throughout, the, 470s, sometimes, in, the, name, of, the, empire, itself, theodoric, launched, campaigns, against, potential, gothic, rivals, and, other, enemies, of, the, eastern, empire, which, made, him, an, important, military, and, political, figure, one, of, his, chief, rivals, was, the, chieftain, of, the, thracian, goths, theodoric, strabo, strabo, means, the, squinter, who, had, led, a, major, revolt, against, the, emperor, zeno, finding, common, ground, with, the, emperor, theodoric, was, rewarded, by, zeno, and, made, commander, of, east, roman, forces, while, his, people, became, foederati, or, federates, of, the, roman, army, in, 471, theodoric, was, recognized, as, king, of, the, ostrogoths, by, 6, 000, goths, that, had, previously, rebelled, against, the, hunnic, ruler, dengizich, in, 467, 468, zeno, attempted, to, play, one, germanic, chieftain, against, another, and, take, advantage, of, an, opportunity, sometime, in, 476, 477, when, after, hearing, demands, from, theodoric, for, new, lands, since, his, people, were, facing, a, famine, he, offered, theodoric, strabo, the, command, once, belonging, to, theodoric, enraged, by, this, betrayal, theodoric, turned, his, wrath, against, the, communities, in, the, rhodope, mountains, where, his, forces, commandeered, livestock, and, slaughtered, peasants, sacked, and, burned, stobi, in, macedonia, and, requisitioned, supplies, from, the, archbishop, at, heraclea, gothic, plundering, finally, elicited, a, settlement, from, zeno, but, theodoric, initially, refused, any, compromise, theodoric, sent, one, of, his, confidants, sidimund, forward, to, epidaurum, for, negotiations, with, zeno, while, the, roman, envoy, and, theodoric, were, negotiating, zeno, sent, troops, against, some, of, theodoric, s, wagons, which, were, under, the, protection, of, his, able, general, theodimund, unaware, of, this, treachery, theodoric, s, goths, lost, around, 2, 000, wagons, and, 5, 000, of, his, people, were, taken, captive, he, settled, his, people, in, epirus, in, 479, with, the, help, of, his, relative, sidimund, in, 482, he, raided, greece, and, sacked, larissa, bad, luck, rebellions, and, poor, decisions, left, zeno, in, an, unfortunate, position, which, subsequently, led, him, to, seek, another, agreement, with, theodoric, in, 483, zeno, made, theodoric, magister, militum, praesentalis, and, consul, designate, in, 484, whereby, he, commanded, the, danubian, provinces, of, dacia, ripensis, and, moesia, inferior, as, well, as, the, adjacent, regions, seeking, further, gains, theodoric, frequently, ravaged, the, provinces, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, eventually, threatening, constantinople, itself, by, 486, there, was, little, disputing, the, open, hostilities, between, theodoric, and, zeno, the, emperor, sought, the, assistance, of, the, bulgars, who, were, likewise, defeated, by, theodoric, in, 487, theodoric, began, his, aggressive, campaign, against, constantinople, blockading, the, city, occupying, strategically, important, suburbs, and, cutting, off, its, water, supply, although, it, seems, theodoric, never, intended, to, occupy, the, city, but, instead, to, use, the, assault, as, a, means, of, gaining, power, and, prestige, from, the, eastern, empire, the, ostrogoths, needed, a, place, to, live, and, zeno, was, having, serious, problems, with, odoacer, the, germanic, foederatus, and, king, of, italy, who, although, ostensibly, viceroy, for, zeno, was, menacing, byzantine, territory, and, not, respecting, the, rights, of, roman, citizens, in, italy, in, 488, zeno, ordered, theodoric, to, overthrow, odoacer, for, this, task, he, received, support, from, rugian, king, frideric, the, son, of, theodoric, s, cousin, giso, theodoric, moved, with, his, people, towards, italy, in, the, autumn, of, 488, on, the, way, he, was, opposed, by, the, gepids, whom, he, defeated, at, sirmium, in, august, 489, arriving, in, italy, theodoric, won, the, battles, of, isonzo, and, verona, in, 489, once, again, theodoric, was, pressed, by, zeno, in, 490, to, attack, odoacer, theodoric, s, army, was, defeated, by, odoacer, s, forces, at, faenza, in, 490, but, regained, the, upper, hand, after, securing, victory, in, the, battle, of, the, adda, river, on, 11, august, 490, for, several, years, the, armies, of, odoacer, and, theodoric, vied, for, supremacy, across, the, italian, peninsula, theodoric, besieged, odoacer, in, ravenna, until, 2, february, 493, when, a, treaty, was, signed, making, the, kings, joint, rulers, of, italy, theodoric, entered, ravenna, on, 5, march, 493, and, a, banquet, celebrating, the, treaty, was, organized, on, 15, march, at, this, feast, theodoric, after, making, a, toast, drew, his, sword, and, struck, odoacer, splitting, him, in, two, from, collarbone, to, thigh, along, with, odoacer, theodoric, had, the, king, s, most, loyal, followers, slaughtered, as, well, making, him, the, master, of, italy, with, odoacer, dead, and, his, forces, dispersed, theodoric, now, faced, the, problem, of, settlement, for, his, people, concerned, about, thinning, out, the, amal, line, too, much, theodoric, believed, he, could, not, afford, to, spread, some, 40, 000, of, his, tribesmen, across, the, entire, italian, peninsula, such, considerations, led, him, to, the, conclusion, that, it, was, best, to, settle, the, ostrogoths, in, three, concentrated, areas, around, pavia, ravenna, and, picenum, theodoric, s, kingdom, was, among, the, most, roman, of, the, barbarian, states, and, he, successfully, ruled, most, of, italy, for, thirty, three, years, following, his, treachery, against, odoacer, he, visited, rome, in, 500, where, he, stayed, for, 6, months, and, held, games, in, the, circus, probably, also, in, the, colosseum, and, renewed, the, grain, largesse, to, the, roman, populace, which, had, perhaps, been, interrupted, since, the, days, of, odoacer, theodoric, extended, his, hegemony, over, the, burgundian, and, vandal, kingdoms, along, with, visigothic, royals, through, marriage, alliances, he, had, married, the, sister, of, the, mighty, frankish, king, clovis, likely, in, recognition, of, frankish, power, he, sent, a, substantial, dowry, accompanied, by, a, guard, of, 5, 000, troops, with, his, sister, amalafrida, when, she, married, the, king, of, the, vandals, and, alans, thrasamund, in, 504, 505, theodoric, extended, his, realms, in, the, balkans, by, defeating, the, gepids, acquiring, the, province, of, pannonia, theodoric, became, regent, for, the, infant, visigothic, king, his, grandson, amalaric, following, the, defeat, of, alaric, ii, by, the, franks, under, clovis, in, 507, the, franks, were, able, to, wrest, control, of, aquitaine, from, the, visigoths, but, otherwise, theodoric, was, able, to, defeat, their, incursions, in, 511, the, visigothic, kingdom, was, brought, under, theodoric, s, direct, control, forming, a, gothic, superstate, that, extended, from, the, atlantic, to, the, danube, while, territories, that, were, lost, to, the, franks, remained, that, way, theodoric, concluded, a, peace, arrangement, with, the, heirs, of, the, frankish, kingdom, once, clovis, was, dead, additional, evidence, of, the, gothic, king, s, extensive, royal, reach, include, the, acts, of, ecclesiastical, councils, that, were, held, in, tarragona, and, gerona, while, both, occurred, in, 516, and, 517, they, date, back, to, the, regnal, years, of, theoderic, which, seem, to, commence, in, the, year, 511, like, odoacer, theodoric, was, ostensibly, only, a, viceroy, for, the, augustus, in, constantinople, but, he, nonetheless, adopted, the, trappings, of, imperial, style, increasingly, emphasizing, his, neo, imperial, status, according, to, historian, peter, brown, theodoric, was, in, the, habit, of, commenting, that, an, able, goth, wants, to, be, like, a, roman, only, a, poor, roman, would, want, to, be, like, a, goth, much, like, the, representatives, of, the, eastern, empire, theodoric, chose, to, be, clad, in, robes, dyed, purple, emulating, the, imperial, colors, and, perhaps, even, to, reinforce, the, imperial, dispatch, of, the, augustus, anastasius, i, which, outlined, theodoric, s, position, as, an, imperial, colleague, chroniclers, like, cassiodorus, added, a, layer, of, legitimacy, for, theodoric, and, the, amal, tribe, from, which, he, came, by, casting, them, as, cooperative, participants, in, the, greater, history, of, the, mediterranean, dating, back, to, the, era, of, alexander, the, great, in, reality, at, least, in, part, due, to, his, formidable, military, he, was, able, to, avoid, imperial, supervision, and, dealings, between, the, emperor, and, theodoric, were, as, equals, unlike, odoacer, however, theodoric, respected, the, agreement, he, had, made, and, allowed, roman, citizens, within, his, kingdom, to, be, subject, to, roman, law, and, the, roman, judicial, system, the, goths, meanwhile, lived, under, their, own, laws, and, customs, in, 519, when, a, mob, had, burned, down, the, synagogues, of, ravenna, theodoric, ordered, the, town, to, rebuild, them, at, its, own, expense, theodoric, experienced, difficulties, before, his, death, he, had, married, off, his, daughter, amalasuintha, to, the, visigoth, eutharic, but, eutharic, died, in, august, 522, or, 523, so, no, lasting, dynastic, connection, of, ostrogoths, and, visigoths, was, established, which, highlighted, the, tensions, between, the, eastern, empire, and, the, west, the, new, augustus, justin, i, who, replaced, anastasius, a, man, with, whom, theodoric, had, good, relations, was, under, the, influence, of, his, nephew, justinian, somehow, imperial, views, hardened, against, the, west, and, talk, of, rome, s, fall, emerged, during, this, period, leading, to, questions, about, the, legitimacy, of, barbarian, rule, theodoric, s, good, relations, with, the, roman, senate, deteriorated, due, to, a, presumed, senatorial, conspiracy, in, 522, and, in, 523, theodoric, had, the, philosopher, and, court, official, boethius, and, boethius, father, in, law, symmachus, arrested, on, charges, of, treason, related, to, the, alleged, plot, for, his, role, theodoric, had, boethius, executed, in, 524, despite, the, complex, relationship, between, theodoric, and, his, son, in, law, the, catholic, burgundian, king, sigismund, the, two, enjoyed, a, mutual, peace, for, fifteen, years, then, in, 522, sigismund, killed, his, own, son, theodoric, s, grandson, sigeric, an, act, which, infuriated, theodoric, and, he, retaliated, by, invading, the, burgundian, kingdom, accompanied, by, the, franks, between, the, two, peoples, sigismund, s, burgundian, forces, faced, two, fronts, and, were, defeated, meanwhile, sigismund, s, arian, brother, godomar, established, himself, as, king, over, the, remaining, burgundian, territory, and, ruled, for, a, decade, when, theodoric, s, sister, amalafrida, sought, to, possibly, change, the, direction, of, vandal, succession, following, the, death, of, her, spouse, the, former, vandal, king, thrasamund, the, new, catholic, vandal, king, hilderic, had, her, along, with, the, accompanying, gothic, retinue, killed, theodoric, was, incensed, and, planned, an, expedition, to, restore, his, power, over, the, vandal, kingdom, when, he, died, of, dysentery, in, the, summer, of, 526, the, gothic, king, was, succeeded, by, his, grandson, athalaric, with, theodoric, s, daughter, amalasuintha, serving, as, regent, since, athalaric, was, but, ten, years, of, age, when, theodoric, died, her, role, was, to, carry, out, the, dead, ruler, s, political, testament, to, seek, accommodation, with, the, senate, and, maintain, peace, with, the, emperor, suddenly, the, once, united, goths, were, split, and, theodoric, s, grandson, amalaric, ruled, the, newly, independent, visigothic, kingdom, for, the, next, five, years, theodoric, was, married, once, he, had, a, concubine, in, moesia, name, unknown, with, whom, he, had, two, daughters, by, his, marriage, in, 493, to, the, pagan, audofleda, the, sister, of, clovis, who, was, baptized, an, arian, at, the, time, of, their, wedding, theodoric, had, one, daughter, after, his, death, in, ravenna, in, 526, theodoric, was, succeeded, by, his, grandson, athalaric, athalaric, was, at, first, represented, by, his, mother, amalasuintha, who, served, as, regent, between, 534, and, 535, the, kingdom, of, the, ostrogoths, however, began, to, wane, and, the, personal, union, of, the, gothic, tribes, once, brought, together, by, theoderic, collapsed, following, his, demise, the, subsequent, campaigns, into, italy, by, justinian, whose, long, reign, from, 527, to, 565, delineates, the, transition, from, antiquity, to, the, middle, ages, in, the, latin, west, according, to, historian, michael, kulikowski, wrought, the, final, blows, to, theodoric, s, once, dominant, kingdom, theodoric, promoted, the, rebuilding, of, roman, cities, and, the, preservation, of, ancient, monuments, in, italy, in, 500, rome, itself, was, given, special, attention, by, theodoric, who, wanted, to, restore, the, structures, previously, damaged, by, time, and, the, barbarians, alike, since, as, he, mused, rome, s, great, buildings, were, witness, to, its, grandeur, power, and, thereto, instructed, his, architects, to, restore, all, that, was, ancient, his, preservation, efforts, were, designed, to, elicit, awe, and, admiration, in, future, generations, the, fame, of, theodoric, s, building, works, reached, far, away, syria, in, the, aggregate, theodoric, s, building, program, saw, more, extensive, new, construction, and, restoration, than, that, of, any, of, the, west, roman, emperors, after, honorius, 395, 423, theodoric, devoted, most, of, his, architectural, attention, to, his, capital, ravenna, he, restored, ravenna, s, water, supply, by, repairing, an, aqueduct, originally, built, by, trajan, according, to, the, chronicles, of, cassiodorus, a, number, of, cities, were, renewed, by, theodoric, s, building, enterprises, some, of, which, even, surpassed, the, ancient, wonders, historian, jonathan, j, arnold, quips, northern, cities, like, ravenna, verona, pavia, milan, parma, como, aquileia, and, still, others, received, new, or, improved, walls, palaces, aqueducts, churches, baths, and, a, host, of, other, impressive, and, glorious, buildings, all, reiterating, to, their, respective, inhabitants, their, own, importance, within, a, newly, revived, and, reinvigorated, roman, empire, and, connecting, such, ideas, with, the, intervention, of, a, caring, and, devoted, princeps, theodoric, he, constructed, a, great, basilica, of, hercules, next, to, a, colossal, statue, of, the, hero, himself, to, promote, arianism, the, king, commissioned, a, small, arian, cathedral, the, hagia, anastasis, which, contains, the, arian, baptistery, three, more, churches, built, by, theodoric, in, ravenna, and, its, suburbs, s, andrea, dei, goti, s, giorgio, and, s, eusebio, were, destroyed, in, the, 13th, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, theodoric, built, the, palace, of, theodoric, for, himself, in, ravenna, modeled, on, the, great, palace, of, constantinople, it, was, an, expansion, of, an, earlier, roman, structure, the, palace, church, of, christ, the, redeemer, survives, and, is, known, today, as, the, basilica, of, sant, apollinare, nuovo, it, was, theodoric, s, personal, church, of, worship, and, was, modeled, specifically, according, to, his, tastes, an, equestrian, statue, of, theodoric, was, erected, in, the, square, in, front, of, the, palace, statues, like, these, were, symbols, of, the, ancient, world, and, theodoric, s, equestrian, likeness, was, meant, to, convey, his, status, as, the, undisputed, ruler, of, the, western, empire, theodoric, the, great, was, interred, in, ravenna, but, his, bones, were, scattered, and, his, mausoleum, was, converted, to, a, church, after, belisarius, conquered, the, city, in, 540, his, mausoleum, is, one, of, the, finest, monuments, in, ravenna, unlike, all, the, other, contemporary, buildings, in, ravenna, which, were, made, of, brick, the, mausoleum, of, theodoric, was, built, completely, from, fine, quality, stone, ashlars, possibly, as, a, reference, to, the, goths, tradition, of, an, origin, in, scandinavia, the, architect, decorated, the, frieze, with, a, pattern, found, in, 5th, and, 6th, century, scandinavian, metal, adornments, the, palace, of, domitian, on, the, palatine, hill, was, reconstructed, using, the, receipts, from, a, specially, levied, tax, while, the, city, walls, of, rome, were, rebuilt, a, feat, celebrated, by, the, senate, of, rome, with, a, gilded, statue, of, theodoric, the, senate, s, curia, the, theatre, of, pompey, the, city, aqueducts, sewers, and, a, granary, were, refurbished, and, repaired, and, statues, were, set, up, in, the, flavian, amphitheatre, in, 522, the, philosopher, boethius, became, his, magister, officiorum, head, of, all, the, government, and, court, services, boethius, was, a, roman, aristocrat, and, christian, humanist, who, was, also, a, philosopher, poet, theologian, mathematician, astronomer, translator, and, commentator, on, aristotle, and, other, greek, luminaries, it, is, hard, to, overestimate, this, one, time, servant, and, eventual, victim, of, theodoric, for, his, influence, on, philosophy, particularly, christian, philosophy, throughout, the, middle, ages, boethius, treatises, and, commentaries, became, textbooks, for, medieval, students, and, the, great, greek, philosophers, were, unknown, except, for, his, latin, translations, the, execution, of, boethius, did, nothing, to, dissipate, tensions, between, arians, and, catholics, but, merely, raised, additional, questions, about, barbarian, imperial, legitimacy, theodoric, was, of, the, arian, nontrinitarian, faith, and, in, his, final, years, he, was, no, longer, the, disengaged, arian, patron, of, religious, toleration, that, he, had, seemed, earlier, in, his, reign, indeed, his, death, cut, short, what, could, well, have, developed, into, a, major, persecution, of, catholic, churches, in, retaliation, for, measures, taken, by, justinian, in, constantinople, against, arians, there, despite, the, byzantine, caesaropapism, which, conflated, imperial, and, ecclesiastical, authority, in, the, same, person, whereby, theodoric, s, arian, beliefs, were, tolerated, under, two, separate, emperors, the, fact, remained, that, to, most, clergy, across, the, eastern, empire, theodoric, was, a, heretic, at, the, end, of, his, reign, quarrels, arose, with, his, roman, subjects, and, the, byzantine, emperor, justin, i, over, the, matter, of, arianism, these, quarrels, ultimately, led, to, the, martyrdom, of, boethius, and, pope, john, i, by, starvation, in, 524, and, 526, respectively, relations, between, the, two, realms, deteriorated, although, theodoric, s, military, abilities, dissuaded, the, byzantines, from, waging, war, against, him, after, his, death, that, reluctance, faded, quickly, seeking, to, restore, the, glory, of, ancient, rome, theodoric, ruled, italy, during, one, of, its, most, peaceful, and, prosperous, periods, and, was, accordingly, hailed, as, a, new, trajan, and, valentinian, i, for, his, building, efforts, and, his, religious, toleration, his, far, sighted, goals, included, taking, what, was, best, from, roman, culture, and, combining, it, with, gothic, energy, and, physical, power, as, a, way, into, the, future, relatively, amicable, relations, between, goths, and, romans, also, make, theodoric, s, kingdom, notable, memories, of, his, reign, made, him, a, hero, of, medieval, german, legends, as, dietrich, von, bern, where, the, two, figures, have, represented, the, same, person, historian, john, julius, norwich, wrote, no, other, germanic, ruler, setting, up, his, throne, on, the, ruins, of, the, western, empire, possessed, a, fraction, of, his, statesmanship, and, political, vision, and, when, he, died, italy, lost, the, greatest, of, her, early, medieval, rulers, unequalled, until, the, days, of, charlemagne, theodoric, is, an, important, figure, in, germanic, heroic, legend, as, the, character, dietrich, von, bern, old, high, german, deotr, h, known, in, old, norse, as, j, rekr, or, i, rekr, and, old, english, as, odr, c, in, german, legends, dietrich, becomes, an, exile, from, his, native, kingdom, of, lombardy, fighting, with, the, help, of, etzel, against, his, usurping, uncle, ermenrich, only, the, old, high,

traditions, of, the, church, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, among, modern, historians, as, to, how, qualify, the, nature, of, power, theodoric, wielded, in, his, domains, traditionalists, have, argued, for, some, time, that, theodoric, was, a, germanic, king, citing, as, their, frame, of, reference, later, byzantine, sources, written, during, the, gothic, war, that, brand, him, as, a, barbarian, king, who, merely, mimicked, roman, customs, one, scholar, jonathan, j, arnold, advocates, that, this, nature, changed, during, the, course, of, the, 6th, century, arnold, alludes, to, local, and, contemporary, sources, such, as, magnus, felix, ennodius, s, vita, beatissimi, viri, epiphani, episcopi, ticinensis, ecclesiae, cassiodorus, s, variae, and, laudes, or, the, pars, posterior, of, the, anonymus, valesianus, arguing, therefrom, that, rome, in, the, west, did, not, fall, in, 476, but, merely, awaited, a, proper, roman, emperor, to, rule, it, according, to, arnold, these, two, sources, ultimately, reveal, that, theodoric, was, actually, viewed, both, by, the, italian, nobility, and, the, eastern, court, in, constantinople, as, a, legitimate, western, roman, emperor, arnold, built, his, case, on, the, fact, that, theodoric, widely, used, the, title, of, princeps, for, himself, and, employed, the, term, res, publica, to, describe, the, domain, he, ruled, these, titles, although, archaic, were, customarily, reserved, for, the, emperor, and, his, empire, thereto, arnold, explains, that, the, restraint, shown, by, theodoric, in, refraining, to, use, titles, such, as, imperator, imperium, or, augustus, was, aimed, at, sparing, the, pride, of, the, eastern, monarchy, and, ensuring, it, of, its, seniority, but, that, this, did, not, diminish, theodoric, s, claim, to, the, purple, in, the, west, this, view, is, however, rejected, by, other, scholars, such, as, theodoric, s, most, recent, biographer, hans, ulrich, wiemer, he, claims, that, jonathan, j, arnold, takes, to, face, value, comments, of, a, few, interested, parties, from, the, italian, nobility, these, few, sources, close, to, theodoric, and, of, a, doubtful, impartiality, should, not, be, used, to, infer, the, general, opinion, toward, theodoric, from, all, classes, of, the, italian, population, nor, in, constantinople, he, further, states, that, this, vision, of, theodoric, s, position, fails, to, address, the, duality, of, its, rule, having, to, retain, the, loyalty, of, both, the, roman, and, the, gothic, parts, of, its, people, wiemer, states, that, the, roman, interpretation, of, theodoric, has, recently, been, taken, to, extremes, in, the, theory, that, theodoric, was, virtually, a, western, roman, emperor, in, italy, according, to, this, view, theodoric, restored, the, roman, empire, in, the, west, which, he, ruled, as, princeps, romanus, demonstrating, his, doubts, on, this, wiemer, points, out, how, during, theodoric, s, rule, he, kept, the, two, ethnic, groups, italo, romans, and, goths, clearly, separated, for, instance, only, goths, could, carry, certain, military, equipment, swords, lances, shields, and, helmets, or, assume, key, positions, in, the, military, hierarchy, and, the, hairstyles, between, goths, and, romans, remained, distinctive, let, alone, their, language, finally, he, states, that, the, eastern, court, never, formally, acknowledged, theodoric, as, a, western, emperor, a, necessary, condition, to, become, one, the, last, of, which, ever, recognized, by, constantinople, being, julius, nepos, who, died, in, 480, likewise, for, political, reasons, the, frankish, and, burgundian, kingdoms, never, recognized, him, as, an, emperor, each, established, as, rulers, in, their, own, right, and, as, theodoric, s, kinsman, they, were, tied, to, one, another, via, diplomatic, marriages
