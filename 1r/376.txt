mythology, he, also, began, reading, nietzsche, in, 1895, and, that, philosopher, s, ideas, of, dual, impulses, of, passion, and, order, in, humankind, was, a, heavy, influence, on, most, of, his,

printed, copies, of, romantic, songs, were, sold, and, one, hour, after, midnight, received, only, one, printing, and, sold, sluggishly, furthermore, hesse, suffered, a, great, shock, when, his, mother, disapproved, of, romantic, songs, on, the, grounds, that, they, were, too, secular, and, even, vaguely, sinful, from, late, 1899, hesse, worked, in, a, distinguished, antique, bookshop, in,

funeral, stating, in, a, letter, to, his, father, i, think, it, would, be, better, for, us, both, that, i, do, not, come, in, spite, of, my, love, for, my, mother, due, to, the, good, notices, that, hesse, received, for, lauscher, the, publisher, samuel, fischer, became, interested, in, hesse, and, with, the, novel, peter, camenzind, which, appeared, first, as, a, pre, publication, in, 1903, and,

began, a, family, eventually, having, three, sons, in, gaienhofen, he, wrote, his, second, novel, beneath, the, wheel, which, was, published, in, 1906, in, the, following, time, he, composed, primarily, short, stories, and, poems, his, story, the, wolf, written, in, 1906, 07, was, quite, possibly, a, foreshadowing, of, steppenwolf, his, next, novel, gertrude, published, in, 1910, revealed, a, production, crisis, he, had, to, struggle, through, writing, it, and, he, later, would, describe, it, as, a, miscarriage, gaienhofen, was, the, place, where, hesse, s, interest, in, buddhism, was, re, sparked, following, a, letter, to, kapff, in, 1895, entitled, nirvana, hesse, had, ceased, alluding, to, buddhist, references, in, his, work, in, 1904, however, arthur, schopenhauer, and, his, philosophical, ideas, started, receiving, attention, again, and, hesse, discovered, theosophy, schopenhauer, and, theosophy, renewed, hesse, s, interest, in, india, although, it, was, many, years, before, the, publication, of, hesse, s, siddhartha, 1922, this, masterpiece, was, to, be, derived, from, these, new, influences, during, this, time, there, also, was, increased, dissonance, between, him, and, maria, and, in, 1911, hesse, left, for, a, long, trip, to, sri, lanka, and, indonesia, he, also, visited, sumatra, borneo, and, burma, but, the, physical, experience, was, to, depress, him, any, spiritual, or, religious, inspiration, that, he, was, looking, for, eluded, him, but, the, journey, made, a, strong, impression, on, his, literary, work, following, hesse, s, return, the, family, moved, to, bern, 1912, but, the, change, of, environment, could, not, solve, the, marriage, problems, as, he, himself, confessed, in, his, novel, rosshalde, from, 1914, at, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, hesse, registered, himself, as, a, volunteer, with, the, imperial, army, saying, that, he, could, not, sit, inactively, by, a, warm, fireplace, while, other, young, authors, were, dying, on, the, front, he, was, found, unfit, for, combat, duty, but, was, assigned, to, service, involving, the, care, of, prisoners, of, war, while, most, poets, and, authors, of, the, warring, countries, quickly, became, embroiled, in, a, tirade, of, mutual, hate, hesse, seemingly, immune, to, the, general, war, enthusiasm, of, the, time, wrote, an, essay, titled, o, friends, not, these, tones, o, freunde, nicht, diese, t, ne, which, was, published, in, the, neue, z, rcher, zeitung, on, 3, november, in, this, essay, he, appealed, to, his, fellow, intellectuals, not, to, fall, for, nationalistic, madness, and, hatred, calling, for, subdued, voices, and, recognition, of, europe, s, common, heritage, hesse, wrote, that, love, is, greater, than, hate, understanding, greater, than, ire, peace, nobler, than, war, this, exactly, is, what, this, unholy, world, war, should, burn, into, our, memories, more, so, than, ever, felt, before, what, followed, from, this, hesse, later, indicated, was, a, great, turning, point, in, his, life, for, the, first, time, he, found, himself, in, the, middle, of, a, serious, political, conflict, attacked, by, the, german, press, the, recipient, of, hate, mail, and, distanced, from, old, friends, however, he, did, receive, support, from, his, friend, theodor, heuss, and, the, french, writer, romain, rolland, who, visited, hesse, in, august, 1915, in, 1917, hesse, wrote, to, rolland, the, attempt, to, apply, love, to, matters, political, has, failed, this, public, controversy, was, not, yet, resolved, when, a, deeper, life, crisis, befell, hesse, with, the, death, of, his, father, on, 8, march, 1916, the, serious, illness, of, his, son, martin, and, his, wife, s, schizophrenia, he, was, forced, to, leave, his, military, service, and, begin, receiving, psychotherapy, this, began, for, hesse, a, long, preoccupation, with, psychoanalysis, through, which, he, came, to, know, carl, jung, personally, and, was, challenged, to, new, creative, heights, hesse, and, jung, both, later, maintained, a, correspondence, with, chilean, author, diplomat, and, nazi, sympathizer, miguel, serrano, who, detailed, his, relationship, with, both, figures, in, the, book, c, g, jung, hermann, hesse, a, record, of, two, friendships, during, a, three, week, period, in, september, and, october, 1917, hesse, penned, his,

here, he, explored, his, writing, projects, further, he, began, to, paint, an, activity, reflected, in, his, next, major, story, klingsor, s, last, summer, published, in, 1920, this, new, beginning, in, different, surroundings, brought, him, happiness, and, hesse, later, called, his, first, year, in, ticino, the, fullest, most, prolific, most, industrious, and, most, passionate, time, of, my, life, in, 1922, hesse, s, novella, siddhartha, appeared, which, showed, the, love, for, indian, culture, and, buddhist, philosophy, that, had, already, developed, earlier, in, his, life, in, 1924,
