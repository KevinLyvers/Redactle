the, campaign, and, especially, zhukov, s, pioneering, use, of, tanks, remained, little, known, outside, the, soviet, union, zhukov, considered, khalkhin, gol, to, be, invaluable, preparation, for, conducting, operations, during, the, second, world, war, in, may, 1940, zhukov, became, an, army, general, making, him, one, of, the, eight, high, ranking, red, army, officers, in, the, autumn, of, 1940, zhukov, started, preparing, plans, for, the, military, exercise, concerning, the, defence, of, the, western, border, of, the, soviet, union, it, had, been, pushed, further, to, the, west, after, the, soviet, union, annexed, eastern, poland, and, the, baltic, republics, in, his, memoirs, zhukov, reports, that, in, this, exercise, he, commanded, the, western, or, blue, forces, the, supposed, invasion, troops, and, his, opponent, was, colonel, general, dmitry, pavlov, the, commander, of, the, eastern, or, red, forces, the, supposed, soviet, troops, he, noted, that, blue, had, 60, divisions, while, red, had, 50, divisions, zhukov, describes, the, exercise, as, being, similar, to, events, that, later, took, place, during, the, german, invasion, russian, historian, bobylev, noted, that, the, details, of, the, exercises, were, reported, differently, by, the, various, participants, who, published, memoirs, he, said, that, there, were, two, exercises, one, from, 2, to, 6, january, 1941, for, the, north, west, direction, another, from, 8, to, 11, january, for, the, south, west, direction, during, the, first, western, forces, attacked, eastern, forces, on, 15, july, but, the, eastern, forces, counterattacked, and, by, 1, august, reached, the, original, border, at, the, time, the, eastern, forces, had, a, numerical, advantage, 51, infantry, divisions, against, 41, 8, 811, tanks, against, 3, 512, with, the, exception, of, anti, tank, guns, bobylev, describes, how, by, the, end, of, the, exercise, the, eastern, forces, did, not, manage, to, surround, and, destroy, the, western, forces, in, their, turn, the, western, forces, threatened, to, surround, the, eastern, forces, the, same, historian, reported, that, the, second, game, was, won, by, the, easterners, meaning, that, on, the, whole, both, games, were, won, by, the, side, commanded, by, zhukov, however, he, noted, that, the, games, had, a, serious, disadvantage, since, they, did, not, consider, an, initial, attack, by, western, forces, but, only, an, attack, by, eastern, forces, from, the, initial, border, according, to, marshal, aleksandr, vasilevsky, the, war, game, defeat, of, pavlov, s, red, troops, against, zhukov, was, not, widely, known, the, victory, of, zhukov, s, blue, troops, was, widely, publicized, which, created, a, popular, illusion, of, easy, success, for, a, preemptive, offensive, on, 1, february, 1941, zhukov, became, chief, of, the, red, army, s, general, staff, he, was, also, elected, a, candidate, member, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, in, february, 1941, and, was, appointed, a, deputy, people, s, commissar, for, defence, in, march, from, 2, february, 1941, as, the, chief, of, the, general, staff, and,

germany, and, its, allies, the, plan, was, completed, no, later, than, 15, may, 1941, according, to, a, dated, document, found, in, the, soviet, archives, after, they, were, declassified, in, the, 1990s, some, researchers, such, as, victor, suvorov, have, theorized, that, on, 14, may, soviet, people, s, commissar, of, defense, semyon, timoshenko, and, general, zhukov, presented, these, plans, to, stalin, for, a, preemptive, attack, against, germany, through, southern, poland, soviet, forces, would, occupy, the, vistula, border, and, continue, to, katowice, or, even, berlin, should, the, main, german, armies, retreat, or, the, baltic, coast, should, german, forces, not, retreat, and, be, forced, to, protect, poland, and, east, prussia, the, attacking, soviets, were, supposed, to, reach, siedlce, d, blin, and, then, capture, warsaw, before, penetrating, toward, the, southwest, and, imposing, final, defeat, at, lublin, historians, do, not, have, the, original, documents, that, could, verify, the, existence, of, such, a, plan, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, stalin, accepted, it, in, a, transcript, of, an, interview, on, 26, may, 1965, zhukov, said, that, stalin, did, not, approve, the, plan, but, zhukov, did, not, clarify, whether, execution, was, attempted, as, of, 1999, no, other, approved, plan, for, a, soviet, attack, had, been, found, on, 10, june, 1941, zhukov, sent, a, message, to, the, military, council, of, the, kiev, special, military, district, after, someone, most, likely, the, commander, of, the, kiev, district, mikhail, kirponos, had, ordered, troops, on, the, border, to, occupy, forward, positions, zhukov, ordered, such, action, could, provoke, the, germans, into, armed, confrontation, fraught, with, all, sorts, of, consequences, revoke, this, order, immediately, and, report, who, specifically, gave, such, an, unauthorised, order, on, 11, june, he, sent, a, telegram, saying, that, his, immediate, superior, timoshenko, had, ordered, that, they, were, to, report, back, by, 16, june, confirming, that, the, troops, had, been, withdrawn, from, their, forward, positions, according, to, the, historian, david, e, murphy, the, action, by, timoshenko, and, zhukov, must, have, been, initiated, at, the, request, of, stalin, david, glantz, and, jonathan, house, american, scholars, of, the, red, army, argue, that, the, soviet, union, was, not, ready, for, war, in, june, 1941, nor, did, it, intend, as, some, have, contended, to, launch, a, preventative, war, gerhard, weinberg, a, scholar, of, nazi, foreign, policy, supports, their, view, arguing, that, adolf, hitler, s, decision, to, launch, operation, barbarossa, was, not, because, of, a, sense, of, urgent, foreboding, but, rather, from, a, purposeful, determination, and, he, had, started, his, planning, for, the, invasion, well, in, advance, of, the, summer, of, 1941, on, 22, june, 1941, germany, launched, operation, barbarossa, an, invasion, of, the, soviet,

grouping, invading, in, vladimir, volynia, and, brody, direction, and, even, to, seize, the, lublin, region, by, the, evening, of, 24, june, this, manoeuvre, failed, and, disorganized, red, army, units, were, destroyed, by, the, wehrmacht, furthermore, the, subsequent, battle, of, kiev, in, september, where, over, 600, 000, soviet, troops, were, captured, or, killed, lowered, his, standing, with, stalin, zhukov, subsequently, claimed, that, he, was, forced, by, joseph, stalin, to, sign, the, directive, supposedly, written, by, aleksandr, vasilevsky, despite, the, reservations, that, he, raised, when, stalin, arrived, unannounced, at, command, headquarters, on, 29, june, demanding, to, know, why, he, was, not, being, told, what, was, happening, at, the, front, zhukov, courageously, told, him, comrade, stalin, our, duty, is, first, of, all, to, help, the, front, commanders, and, only, then, to, inform, you, but, when, he, had, to, admit, that, they, lost, contact, with, the,

be, gathered, from, reading, rokossovsky, s, comments, in, an, official, report, on, zhukov, s, character, has, a, strong, will, decisive, and, firm, often, demonstrates, initiative, and, skillfully, applies, it, disciplined, demanding, and, persistent, in, his, demands, a, somewhat, ungracious, and, not, sufficiently, sympathetic, person, rather, stubborn, painfully, proud, in, professional,

tsouras, described, the, move, from, odessa, to, the, urals, as, a, relegation, from, a, second, rate, to, a, fifth, rate, assignment, throughout, this, time, security, chief, lavrentiy, beria, was, supposedly, trying, to, topple, zhukov, two, of, zhukov, s, subordinates, marshal, of, aviation, alexander, novikov, and, lieutenant, general, konstantin, telegin, were, arrested, and, tortured, in, lefortovo, prison, at, the, end, of, 1945, after, stalin, s, death, it, was, claimed, that, novikov, was, allegedly, forced, by, beria, into, a, confession, which, implicated, zhukov, in, a, conspiracy, in, reality, novikov, may, have, been, encouraged, to, point, the, finger, at, zhukov, because, he, saw, zhukov, s, membership, at, the, investigation, commission, of, the, aviators, affair, a, purge, of, the, soviet, aircraft, industry, following, accusations, that, during, the, war, the, fighter, planes, had, been, of, poor, quality, in, which, novikov, was, implicated, as, instrumental, to, his, downfall, regardless, in, a, conference, all, generals, except, gru, director, filipp, golikov, defended, zhukov, against, accusation, of, misspending, during, this, time, zhukov, was, accused, of, unauthorized, looting, of, goods, confiscated, by, the, germans, and, of, bonapartism, in, 1946, seven, rail, carriages, with, furniture, that, zhukov, was, taking, to, the, soviet, union, from, germany, were, impounded, in, 1948, his, apartments, and, house, in, moscow, were, searched, and, many, valuables, looted, from, germany, were, found, in, his, investigation, beria, concluded, that, zhukov, had, in, his, possession, 17, golden, rings, three, gemstones, the, faces, of, 15, golden, necklaces, more, than, four, kilometers, 2, 5, mi, of, cloth, 323, pieces, of, fur, 44, carpets, taken, from, german, palaces, 55, paintings, and, 20, guns, zhukov, admitted, in, a, memorandum, to, zhdanov, i, felt, very, guilty, i, shouldn, t, have, collected, those, useless, junks, and, put, them, into, some, warehouse, assuming, nobody, needs, them, any, more, i, swear, as, a, bolshevik, that, i, would, avoid, such, errors, and, follies, thereafter, surely, i, still, and, will, wholeheartedly, serve, the, motherland, the, party, and, the, great, comrade, stalin, when, learning, of, zhukov, s, misfortunes, and, despite, not, understanding, all, the, problems, eisenhower, expressed, his, sympathy, for, his, comrade, in, arms, in, february, 1953, stalin, relieved, zhukov, of, his, post, as, commander, of, the, urals, military, district, recalling, zhukov, to, moscow, it, was, thought, zhukov, s, expertise, was, needed, in, the, korean, war, however, in, practice, zhukov, received, no, orders, from, stalin, after, arriving, in, moscow, on, 5, march, 1953, at, 09, 50, stalin, died, of, a, stroke, following, stalin, s, passing, zhukov, s, life, entered, a, new, phase, during, the, war, zhukov, was, one, of, only, a, few, people, who, understood, stalin, s, personality, as, the, chief, of, staff, and, deputy, supreme, commander, zhukov, had, hundreds, of, meetings, with, stalin, both, private, and, during, stavka, conferences, consequently, zhukov, understood, stalin, s, personality, and, methods, well, according, to, zhukov, stalin, was, a, bold, and, secretive, person, but, he, was, also, hot, tempered, and, skeptical, zhukov, was, able, to, gauge, stalin, s, mood, for, example, when, stalin, drew, deeply, on, his, tobacco, pipe, it, was, a, sign, of, a, good, mood, conversely, if, stalin, failed, to, light, his, pipe, once, it, was, out, of, tobacco, it, was, a, sign, of, imminent, rage, his, outstanding, knowledge, of, stalin, s, personality, was, an, asset, that, allowed, him, to, deal, with, stalin, s, outbursts, in, a, way, other, soviet, generals, could, not, both, zhukov, and, stalin, were, hot, tempered, and, both, made, concessions, necessary, to, sustain, their, relationship, while, zhukov, viewed, his, relationship, with, stalin, as, one, of, a, subordinate, senior, stalin, was, in, awe, and, possibly, jealous, of, zhukov, both, were, military, commanders, but, stalin, s, experience, was, limited, to, a, previous, generation, of, non, mechanized, warfare, by, contrast, zhukov, was, highly, influential, in, the, development, of, contemporary, combined, operations, of, highly, mechanized, armies, the, differences, in, their, outlooks, were, the, cause, of, many, tempestuous, disagreements, between, the, two, of, them, at, stavka, meetings, nonetheless, zhukov, was, less, competent, than, stalin, as, a, politician, highlighted, by, zhukov, s, many, failures, in, politics, stalin, s, unwillingness, to, value, zhukov, beyond, the, marshal, s, military, talents, was, one, of, the, reasons, why, zhukov, was, recalled, from, berlin, significant, to, their, relationship, as, well, was, zhukov, s, bluntness, towards, his, superior, stalin, was, dismissive, of, the, fawning, of, many, of, his, entourage, and, openly, criticized, it, many, people, around, stalin, including, beria, yezhov, and, mekhlis, felt, obliged, to, flatter, stalin, to, remain, on, his, good, side, zhukov, remained, obstinate, and, argumentative, and, did, not, hesitate, to, publicly, contradict, stalin, to, the, point, of, risking, his, career, and, life, their, heated, argument, about, whether, to, abandon, kiev, due, to, the, germans, rapid, advance, in, summer, of, 1941, was, typical, of, zhukov, s, approach, zhukov, s, ability, to, remain, skeptical, and, unwavering, at, giving, in, to, pressure, did, garner, him, the, respect, of, stalin, after, stalin, s, death, zhukov, returned, to, favor, becoming, deputy, defence, minister, in, 1953, he, then, had, an, opportunity, to, avenge, himself, on, beria, with, stalin, s, sudden, death, the, soviet, union, fell, into, a, leadership, crisis, georgy, malenkov, temporarily, became, first, secretary, malenkov, and, his, allies, attempted, to, purge, stalin, s, influence, and, personality, cult, however, malenkov, himself, did, not, have, the, courage, to, do, this, alone, moreover, lavrentiy, beria, remained, dangerous, the, politicians, sought, reinforcement, from, the, powerful, and, prestigious, military, men, in, this, matter, nikita, khrushchev, chose, zhukov, because, the, two, had, forged, a, good, relationship, and, in, addition, during, world, war, ii, zhukov, had, twice, saved, khrushchev, from, false, accusations, on, 26, june, 1953, a, special, meeting, of, the, politburo, was, held, by, malenkov, beria, came, to, the, meeting, with, an, uneasy, feeling, because, it, was, called, hastily, indeed, zhukov, had, ordered, general, kirill, moskalenko, to, secretly, prepare, a, special, force, and, permitted, the, force, to, use, two, of, zhukov, s, and, defence, minister, nikolai, bulganin, s, special, cars, which, had, tinted, windows, in, order, to, safely, infiltrate, the, kremlin, zhukov, also, ordered, him, to, replace, the, mvd, guard, with, the, guard, of, the, moscow, military, district, finally, khrushchev, suggested, expelling, beria, from, the, communist, party, and, bringing, him, before, a, military, court, moskalenko, s, special, forces, obeyed, zhukov, was, a, member, of, the, military, tribunal, during, the, beria, trial, which, was, headed, by, marshal, ivan, konev, on, 18, december, 1953, the, military, court, sentenced, beria, to, death, during, the, burial, of, beria, konev, commented, the, day, this, man, was, born, deserves, to, be, damned, then, zhukov, said, i, considered, it, as, my, duty, to, contribute, my, little, part, in, this, matter, when, bulganin, became, premier, in, 1955, he, appointed, zhukov, as, defense, minister, zhukov, participated, in, many, political, activities, he, successfully, opposed, the, re, establishment, of, the, commissar, system, because, the, party, and, political, leaders, were, not, professional, military, and, thus, the, highest, power, should, fall, to, the, army, commanders, until, 1955, zhukov, had, both, sent, to, and, received, letters, from, eisenhower, both, leaders, agreed, that, the, two, superpowers, should, coexist, peacefully, in, july, 1955, zhukov, together, with, khrushchev, bulganin, vyacheslav, molotov, and, andrei, gromyko, participated, in, a, summit, conference, at, geneva, after, the, ussr, signed, the, austrian, state, treaty, and, withdrew, its, army, from, the, country, zhukov, followed, orders, from, the, then, prime, minister, georgy, malenkov, and, communist, party, leader, khrushchev, during, the, invasion, of, hungary, following, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, along, with, the, majority, of, members, of, the, presidium, he, urged, khrushchev, to, send, troops, to, support, the, hungarian, authorities, and, to, secure, the, austrian, border, zhukov, and, most, of, the, presidium, were, not, however, eager, to, see, a, full, scale, intervention, in, hungary, zhukov, even, recommended, the, withdrawal, of, soviet, troops, when, it, seemed, that, they, might, have, to, take, extreme, measures, to, suppress, the, revolution, the, mood, in, the, presidium, changed, again, when, hungary, s, new, prime, minister, imre, nagy, began, to, talk, about, hungarian, withdrawal, from, the, warsaw, pact, that, led, the, soviets, to, attack, the, revolutionaries, and, to, replace, nagy, with, j, nos, k, d, r, in, the, same, years, when, the, uk, france, and, israel, invaded, egypt, during, the, suez, crisis, zhukov, expressed, support, for, egypt, s, right, of, self, defense, in, october, 1957, zhukov, visited, yugoslavia, and, albania, aboard, the, chapayev, class, cruiser, kuibyshev, attempting, to, repair, the, tito, stalin, split, of, 1948, during, the, voyage, kuibyshev, encountered, units, of, the, u, s, sixth, fleet, and, passing, honours, in, the, form, of, full, salvos, were, exchanged, between, the, vessels, on, his, 60th, birthday, in, 1956, zhukov, received, his, fourth, hero, of, the, soviet, union, title, making, him, the, first, person, to, receive, the, honour, four, times, the, only, other, four, time, recipient, was, leonid, brezhnev, who, never, rose, above, modest, military, rank, and, received, all, of, his, four, hero, of, the, soviet, union, medals, for, his, birthday, as, part, of, his, overall, cult, of, personality, and, love, for, medals, titles, and, decorations, despite, his, general, lack, of, political, ability, zhukov, became, the, highest, ranking, military, professional, who, was, also, a, member, of, the, presidium, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, he, further, became, a, symbol, of, national, strength, the, most, widely, esteemed, soviet, military, hero, of, world, war, ii, zhukov, s, prestige, was, even, higher, than, the, police, and, security, agencies, of, the, ussr, and, thus, rekindled, concerns, among, political, leaders, going, even, further, than, khrushchev, zhukov, demanded, that, the, political, agencies, in, the, red, army, report, to, him, before, the, party, he, demanded, an, official, condemnation, of, stalin, s, crimes, during, the, great, purge, he, also, supported, the, political, vindication, and, rehabilitation, of, mikhail, tukhachevsky, grigoriy, shtern, vasily, blyukher, alexander, yegorov, and, many, others, in, response, his, opponents, accused, him, of, being, a, reformist, and, bonapartist, such, enviousness, and, hostility, proved, to, be, the, key, factor, that, led, to, his, later, downfall, the, relationship, between, zhukov, and, khrushchev, reached, its, peak, during, the, 20th, congress, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, cpsu, in, 1956, after, becoming, the, first, secretary, of, the, party, khrushchev, moved, against, stalin, s, legacy, and, criticised, his, personality, cult, in, a, speech, on, the, cult, of, personality, and, its, consequences, to, complete, such, startling, acts, khrushchev, needed, the, approval, or, at, least, the, acquiescence, of, the, military, headed, by, minister, of, defense, zhukov, at, the, plenary, session, of, the, central, committee, of, the, cpsu, held, in, june, 1957, zhukov, supported, khrushchev, against, the, anti, party, group, that, had, a, majority, in, the, presidium, and, voted, to, replace, khrushchev, as, first, secretary, with, bulganin, at, that, plenum, zhukov, stated, the, army, is, against, this, resolution, and, not, even, a, tank, will, leave, its, position, without, my, order, in, the, same, session, the, anti, party, group, was, condemned, and, zhukov, was, made, a, member, of, the, presidium, his, second, fall, was, more, sudden, and, public, even, than, his, first, on, 4, october, 1957, he, left, on, an, official, visit, to, yugoslavia, and, albania, he, returned, to, moscow, on, 26, october, straight, to, a, meeting, of, the, presidium, during, which,

announced, zhukov, s, return, also, reported, that, he, had, been, relieved, of, his, duties, according, to, many, researchers, soviet, politicians, including, khrushchev, himself, had, a, deep, seated, fear, of, powerful, people, after, being, forced, out, of, the, government, zhukov, stayed, away, from, politics, many, people, including, former, subordinates, frequently, paid, him, visits, joined, him, on, hunting, excursions, and, exchanged, reminiscences, in, september, 1959, while, visiting, the, united, states, khrushchev, told, president, eisenhower, that, the, retired, marshal, zhukov, liked, fishing, zhukov, was, actually, a, keen, aquarist, in, response, eisenhower, sent, zhukov, a, set, of, fishing, tackle, zhukov, respected, this, gift, so, much, that, he, is, said, to, have, exclusively, used, eisenhower, s, fishing, tackle, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, referring, to, soviet, fishing, tackle, as, substandard, after, khrushchev, was, deposed, in, october, 1964, brezhnev, restored, zhukov, to, favor, though, not, to, power, in, a, move, to, use, zhukov, s, popularity, to, strengthen, his, political, position, zhukov, s, name, was, put, in, the, public, eye, yet, again, when, brezhnev, lionised, zhukov, in, a, speech, commemorating, the, great, patriotic, war, on, 9, may, 1965, zhukov, was, invited, to, sit, on, the, tribune, of, the, lenin,

clashed, constantly, with, mikhail, suslov, the, communist, party, s, chief, ideologue, and, second, in, command, in, charge, of, censorship, who, demanded, many, revisions, and, removals, particularly, his, criticisms, of, stalin, voroshilov, budyonny, and, molotov, after, brezhnev, came, to, power, suslov, made, further, demands, to, exaggerate, colonel, brezhnev, s, role, in, wwii, by, glorifying, the, little, known, and, strategically, unimportant, battles, of, malaya, zemlya, and, novorossiysk, as, a, decisive, turning, point, in, the, eastern, front, both, of, which, zhukov,
