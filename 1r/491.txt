pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, t, a, k, f, s, k, i, chy, kof, skee, 7, may, 1840, 6, november, 1893, was, a, russian, composer, during, the, romantic, period, he, was, the, first, russian, composer, whose, music, would, make, a, lasting, impression, internationally, tchaikovsky, wrote, some, of, the, most, popular, concert, and, theatrical, music, in, the, current, classical, repertoire, including, the, ballets, swan, lake, and, the, nutcracker, the, 1812, overture, his, first, piano, concerto, violin, concerto, the, romeo, and, juliet, overture, fantasy, several, symphonies, and, the, opera, eugene, onegin, although, musically, precocious, tchaikovsky, was, educated, for, a, career, as, a, civil, servant, as, there, was, little, opportunity, for, a, musical, career, in, russia, at, the, time, and, no, system, of, public, music, education, when, an, opportunity, for, such, an, education, arose, he, entered, the, nascent, saint, petersburg, conservatory, from, which, he, graduated, in, 1865, the, formal, western, oriented, teaching, that, tchaikovsky, received, there, set, him, apart, from, composers, of, the, contemporary, nationalist, movement, embodied, by, the, russian, composers, of, the, five, with, whom, his, professional, relationship, was, mixed, tchaikovsky, s, training, set, him, on, a, path, to, reconcile, what, he, had, learned, with, the, native, musical, practices, to, which, he, had, been, exposed, from, childhood, from, that, reconciliation, he, forged, a, personal, but, unmistakably, russian, style, the, principles, that, governed, melody, harmony, and, other, fundamentals, of, russian, music, diverged, from, those, that, governed, western, european, music, which, seemed, to, defeat, the, potential, for, using, russian, music, in, large, scale, western, composition, or, for, forming, a, composite, style, and, it, caused, personal, antipathies, that, dented, tchaikovsky, s, self, confidence, russian, culture, exhibited, a, split, personality, with, its, native, and, adopted, elements, having, drifted, apart, increasingly, since, the, time, of, peter, the, great, that, resulted, in, uncertainty, among, the, intelligentsia, about, the, country, s, national, identity, an, ambiguity, mirrored, in, tchaikovsky, s, career, despite, his, many, popular, successes, tchaikovsky, s, life, was, punctuated, by, personal, crises, and, depression, contributory, factors, included, his, early, separation, from, his, mother, for, boarding, school, followed, by, his, mother, s, early, death, the, death, of, his, close, friend, and, colleague, nikolai, rubinstein, his, failed, marriage, with, antonina, miliukova, and, the, collapse, of, his, 13, year, association, with, the, wealthy, patroness, nadezhda, von, meck, tchaikovsky, s, homosexuality, which, he, kept, private, has, traditionally, also, been, considered, a, major, factor, though, some, scholars, have, played, down, its, importance, his, dedication, of, his, sixth, symphony, to, his, nephew, vladimir, bob, davydov, and, his, feelings, expressed, about, davydov, in, letters, to, others, especially, following, davydov, s, suicide, have, been, cited, as, evidence, for, a, romantic, love, between, the, two, tchaikovsky, s, sudden, death, at, the, age, of, 53, is, generally, ascribed, to, cholera, but, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, as, to, whether, cholera, was, indeed, the, cause, and, whether, the, death, was, accidental, or, intentional, while, his, music, has, remained, popular, among, audiences, critical, opinions, were, initially, mixed, some, russians, did, not, feel, it, was, sufficiently, representative, of, native, musical, values, and, expressed, suspicion, that, europeans, accepted, the, music, for, its, western, elements, in, an, apparent, reinforcement, of, the, latter, claim, some, europeans, lauded, tchaikovsky, for, offering, music, more, substantive, than, exoticism, and, said, he, transcended, the, stereotypes, of, russian, classical, music, others, dismissed, tchaikovsky, s, music, as, deficient, because, it, did, not, stringently, follow, western, principles, tchaikovsky, was, born, on, 7, may, 1840, in, votkinsk, a, small, town, in, vyatka, governorate, during, the, russian, empire, in, present, day, udmurtia, near, the, banks, of, the, kama, river, his, father, ilya, petrovich, tchaikovsky, served, as, a, lieutenant, colonel, and, engineer, in, the, department, of, mines, and, managed, the, ironworks, in, kamsko, votkinsk, his, grandfather, pyotr, fedorovich, tchaikovsky, was, born, in, the, village, of, nikolaevka, yekaterinoslav, governorate, russian, empire, in, present, day, mykolaivka, ukraine, and, served, first, as, a, physician, s, assistant, in, the, army, and, later, as, city, governor, of, glazov, in, vyatka, his, great, grandfather, a, zaporozhian, cossack, named, fyodor, chaika, served, in, the, russian, military, at, the, battle, of, poltava, in, 1709, tchaikovsky, s, mother, alexandra, andreyevna, n, e, d, assier, was, the, second, of, ilya, s, three, wives, his, first, wife, died, several, years, before, pyotr, s, birth, she, was, 18, years, younger, than, her, husband, and, was, of, french, and, german, ethnicity, through, her, paternal, side, both, ilya, and, alexandra, were, trained, in, the, arts, including, music, of, his, six, siblings, tchaikovsky, was, close, to, his, sister, alexandra, and, twin, brothers, anatoly, and, modest, alexandra, s, marriage, to, lev, davydov, would, produce, seven, children, and, lend, tchaikovsky, the, only, real, family, life, he, would, know, as, an, adult, especially, during, his, years, of, wandering, one, of, those, children, vladimir, davydov, who, went, by, the, nickname, bob, would, become, very, close, to, him, in, 1844, the, family, hired, fanny, d, rbach, a, 22, year, old, french, governess, four, and, a, half, year, old, tchaikovsky, was, initially, thought, too, young, to, study, alongside, his, older, brother, nikolai, and, a, niece, of, the, family, his, insistence, convinced, d, rbach, otherwise, by, the, age, of, six, he, had, become, fluent, in, french, and, german, tchaikovsky, also, became, attached, to, the, young, woman, her, affection, for, him, was, reportedly, a, counter, to, his, mother, s, coldness, and, emotional, distance, from, him, though, others, assert, that, the, mother, doted, on, her, son, d, rbach, saved, much, of, tchaikovsky, s, work, from, this, period, including, his, earliest, known, compositions, and, became, a, source, of, several, childhood, anecdotes, tchaikovsky, began, piano, lessons, at, age, five, within, three, years, he, had, become, as, adept, at, reading, sheet, music, as, his, teacher, tchaikovsky, s, parents, initially, supportive, hired, a, tutor, bought, an, orchestrion, a, form, of, barrel, organ, that, could, imitate, elaborate, orchestral, effects, and, encouraged, his, piano, study, for, both, aesthetic, and, practical, reasons, however, they, decided, in, 1850, to, send, tchaikovsky, to, the, imperial, school, of, jurisprudence, in, saint, petersburg, they, had, both, graduated, from, institutes, in, saint, petersburg, and, the, school, of, jurisprudence, which, mainly, served, the, lesser, nobility, and, thought, that, this, education, would, prepare, tchaikovsky, for, a, career, as, a, civil, servant, regardless, of, talent, the, only, musical, careers, available, in, russia, at, that, time, except, for, the, affluent, aristocracy, were, as, a, teacher, in, an, academy, or, as, an, instrumentalist, in, one, of, the, imperial, theaters, both, were, considered, on, the, lowest, rank, of, the, social, ladder, with, individuals, in, them, enjoying, no, more, rights, than, peasants, tchaikovsky, s, father, s, income, was, also, growing, increasingly, uncertain, so, both, parents, may, have, wanted, tchaikovsky, to, become, independent, as, soon, as, possible, as, the, minimum, age, for, acceptance, was, 12, and, tchaikovsky, was, only, 10, at, the, time, he, was, required, to, spend, two, years, boarding, at, the, imperial, school, of, jurisprudence, s, preparatory, school, 1, 300, kilometres, 800, mi, from, his, family, once, those, two, years, had, passed, tchaikovsky, transferred, to, the, imperial, school, of, jurisprudence, to, begin, a, seven, year, course, of, studies, tchaikovsky, s, early, separation, from, his, mother, despite, the, aforementioned, alleged, distant, relationship, caused, an, emotional, trauma, that, lasted, the, rest, of, his, life, and, was, intensified, by, her, death, from, cholera, in, 1854, when, he, was, 14, the, loss, of, his, mother, also, prompted, tchaikovsky, to, make, his, first, serious, attempt, at, composition, a, waltz, in, her, memory, tchaikovsky, s, father, who, had, also, contracted, cholera, but, recovered, fully, sent, him, back, to, school, immediately, in, the, hope, that, classwork, would, occupy, the, boy, s, mind, isolated, tchaikovsky, compensated, with, friendships, with, fellow, students, that, became, lifelong, these, included, aleksey, apukhtin, and, vladimir, gerard, music, while, not, an, official, priority, at, school, also, bridged, the, gap, between, tchaikovsky, and, his, peers, they, regularly, attended, the, opera, and, tchaikovsky, would, improvise, at, the, school, s, harmonium, on, themes, he, and, his, friends, had, sung, during, choir, practice, we, were, amused, vladimir, gerard, later, remembered, but, not, imbued, with, any, expectations, of, his, future, glory, tchaikovsky, also, continued, his, piano, studies, through, franz, becker, an, instrument, manufacturer, who, made, occasional, visits, to, the, school, however, the, results, according, to, musicologist, david, brown, were, negligible, in, 1855, tchaikovsky, s, father, funded, private, lessons, with, rudolph, k, ndinger, and, questioned, him, about, a, musical, career, for, his, son, while, impressed, with, the, boy, s, talent, k, ndinger, said, he, saw, nothing, to, suggest, a, future, composer, or, performer, he, later, admitted, that, his, assessment, was, also, based, on, his, own, negative, experiences, as, a, musician, in, russia, and, his, unwillingness, for, tchaikovsky, to, be, treated, likewise, tchaikovsky, was, told, to, finish, his, course, and, then, try, for, a, post, in, the, ministry, of, justice, on, 10, june, 1859, the, 19, year, old, tchaikovsky, graduated, as, a, titular, counselor, a, low, rung, on, the, civil, service, ladder, appointed, to, the, ministry, of, justice, he, became, a, junior, assistant, within, six, months, and, a, senior, assistant, two, months, after, that, he, remained, a, senior, assistant, for, the, rest, of, his, three, year, civil, service, career, meanwhile, the, russian, musical, society, rms, was, founded, in, 1859, by, the, grand, duchess, elena, pavlovna, a, german, born, aunt, of, tsar, alexander, ii, and, her, prot, g, pianist, and, composer, anton, rubinstein, previous, tsars, and, the, aristocracy, had, focused, almost, exclusively, on, importing, european, talent, the, aim, of, the, rms, was, to, fulfill, alexander, ii, s, wish, to, foster, native, talent, it, hosted, a, regular, season, of, public, concerts, previously, held, only, during, the, six, weeks, of, lent, when, the, imperial, theaters, were, closed, and, provided, basic, professional, training, in, music, in, 1861, tchaikovsky, attended, rms, classes, in, music, theory, taught, by, nikolai, zaremba, at, the, mikhailovsky, palace, now, the, russian, museum, these, classes, were, a, precursor, to, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, which, opened, in, 1862, tchaikovsky, enrolled, at, the, conservatory, as, part, of, its, premiere, class, he, studied, harmony, and, counterpoint, with, zaremba, and, instrumentation, and, composition, with, rubinstein, he, was, awarded, a, silver, medal, for, his, thesis, a, cantata, on, schiller, s, ode, to, joy, the, conservatory, benefited, tchaikovsky, in, two, ways, it, transformed, him, into, a, musical, professional, with, tools, to, help, him, thrive, as, a, composer, and, the, in, depth, exposure, to, european, principles, and, musical, forms, gave, him, a, sense, that, his, art, was, not, exclusively, russian, or, western, this, mindset, became, important, in, tchaikovsky, s, reconciliation, of, russian, and, european, influences, in, his, compositional, style, he, believed, and, attempted, to, show, that, both, these, aspects, were, intertwined, and, mutually, dependent, his, efforts, became, both, an, inspiration, and, a, starting, point, for, other, russian, composers, to, build, their, own, individual, styles, rubinstein, was, impressed, by, tchaikovsky, s, musical, talent, on, the, whole, and, cited, him, as, a, composer, of, genius, in, his, autobiography, he, was, less, pleased, with, the, more, progressive, tendencies, of, some, of, tchaikovsky, s, student, work, nor, did, he, change, his, opinion, as, tchaikovsky, s, reputation, grew, he, and, zaremba, clashed, with, tchaikovsky, when, he, submitted, his, first, symphony, for, performance, by, the, russian, musical, society, in, saint, petersburg, rubinstein, and, zaremba, refused, to, consider, the, work, unless, substantial, changes, were, made, tchaikovsky, complied, but, they, still, refused, to, perform, the, symphony, tchaikovsky, distressed, that, he, had, been, treated, as, though, he, were, still, their, student, withdrew, the, symphony, it, was, given, its, first, complete, performance, minus, the, changes, rubinstein, and, zaremba, had, requested, in, moscow, in, february, 1868, once, tchaikovsky, graduated, in, 1865, rubinstein, s, brother, nikolai, offered, him, the, post, of, professor, of, music, theory, at, the, soon, to, open, moscow, conservatory, while, the, salary, for, his, professorship, was, only, 50, rubles, a, month, the, offer, itself, boosted, tchaikovsky, s, morale, and, he, accepted, the, post, eagerly, he, was, further, heartened, by, news, of, the, first, public, performance, of, one, of, his, works, his, characteristic, dances, conducted, by, johann, strauss, ii, at, a, concert, in, pavlovsk, park, on, 11, september, 1865, tchaikovsky, later, included, this, work, re, titled, dances, of, the, hay, maidens, in, his, opera, the, voyevoda, from, 1867, to, 1878, tchaikovsky, combined, his, professorial, duties, with, music, criticism, while, continuing, to, compose, this, activity, exposed, him, to, a, range, of, contemporary, music, and, afforded, him, the, opportunity, to, travel, abroad, in, his, reviews, he, praised, beethoven, considered, brahms, overrated, and, despite, his, admiration, took, schumann, to, task, for, poor, orchestration, he, appreciated, the, staging, of, wagner, s, der, ring, des, nibelungen, at, its, inaugural, performance, in, bayreuth, germany, but, not, the, music, calling, das, rheingold, unlikely, nonsense, through, which, from, time, to, time, sparkle, unusually, beautiful, and, astonishing, details, a, recurring, theme, he, addressed, was, the, poor, state, of, russian, opera, in, 1856, while, tchaikovsky, was, still, at, the, school, of, jurisprudence, and, anton, rubinstein, lobbied, aristocrats, to, form, the, russian, musical, society, critic, vladimir, stasov, and, an, 18, year, old, pianist, mily, balakirev, met, and, agreed, upon, a, nationalist, agenda, for, russian, music, one, that, would, take, the, operas, of, mikhail, glinka, as, a, model, and, incorporate, elements, from, folk, music, reject, traditional, western, practices, and, use, non, western, harmonic, devices, such, as, the, whole, tone, and, octatonic, scales, they, saw, western, style, conservatories, as, unnecessary, and, antipathetic, to, fostering, native, talent, balakirev, c, sar, cui, modest, mussorgsky, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, and, alexander, borodin, became, known, as, the, moguchaya, kuchka, translated, into, english, as, the, mighty, handful, or, the, five, rubinstein, criticized, their, emphasis, on, amateur, efforts, in, musical, composition, balakirev, and, later, mussorgsky, attacked, rubinstein, for, his, musical, conservatism, and, his, belief, in, professional, music, training, tchaikovsky, and, his, fellow, conservatory, students, were, caught, in, the, middle, while, ambivalent, about, much, of, the, five, s, music, tchaikovsky, remained, on, friendly, terms, with, most, of, its, members, in, 1869, he, and, balakirev, worked, together, on, what, became, tchaikovsky, s, first, recognized, masterpiece, the, fantasy, overture, romeo, and, juliet, a, work, which, the, five, wholeheartedly, embraced, the, group, also, welcomed, his, second, symphony, later, nicknamed, the, little, russian, despite, their, support, tchaikovsky, made, considerable, efforts, to, ensure, his, musical, independence, from, the, group, as, well, as, from, the, conservative, faction, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, the, infrequency, of, tchaikovsky, s, musical, successes, won, with, tremendous, effort, exacerbated, his, lifelong, sensitivity, to, criticism, nikolai, rubinstein, s, private, fits, of, rage, critiquing, his, music, such, as, attacking, the, first, piano, concerto, did, not, help, matters, his, popularity, grew, however, as, several, first, rate, artists, became, willing, to, perform, his, compositions, hans, von, b, low, premiered, the, first, piano, concerto, and, championed, other, tchaikovsky, works, both, as, pianist, and, conductor, other, artists, included, adele, aus, der, ohe, max, erdmannsd, rfer, eduard, n, pravn, k, and, sergei, taneyev, another, factor, that, helped, tchaikovsky, s, music, become, popular, was, a, shift, in, attitude, among, russian, audiences, whereas, they, had, previously, been, satisfied, with, flashy, virtuoso, performances, of, technically, demanding, but, musically, lightweight, works, they, gradually, began, listening, with, increasing, appreciation, of, the, composition, itself, tchaikovsky, s, works, were, performed, frequently, with, few, delays, between, their, composition, and, first, performances, the, publication, from, 1867, onward, of, his, songs, and, great, piano, music, for, the, home, market, also, helped, boost, the, composer, s, popularity, during, the, late, 1860s, tchaikovsky, began, to, compose, operas, his, first, the, voyevoda, based, on, a, play, by, alexander, ostrovsky, premiered, in, 1869, the, composer, became, dissatisfied, with, it, however, and, having, re, used, parts, of, it, in, later, works, destroyed, the, manuscript, undina, followed, in, 1870, only, excerpts, were, performed, and, it, too, was, destroyed, between, these, projects, tchaikovsky, started, to, compose, an, opera, called, mandragora, to, a, libretto, by, sergei, rachinskii, the, only, music, he, completed, was, a, short, chorus, of, flowers, and, insects, the, first, tchaikovsky, opera, to, survive, intact, the, oprichnik, premiered, in, 1874, during, its, composition, he, lost, ostrovsky, s, part, finished, libretto, tchaikovsky, too, embarrassed, to, ask, for, another, copy, decided, to, write, the, libretto, himself, modeling, his, dramatic, technique, on, that, of, eug, ne, scribe, cui, wrote, a, characteristically, savage, press, attack, on, the, opera, mussorgsky, writing, to, vladimir, stasov, disapproved, of, the, opera, as, pandering, to, the, public, nevertheless, the, oprichnik, continues, to, be, performed, from, time, to, time, in, russia, the, last, of, the, early, operas, vakula, the, smith, op, 14, was, composed, in, the, second, half, of, 1874, the, libretto, based, on, gogol, s, christmas, eve, was, to, have, been, set, to, music, by, alexander, serov, with, serov, s, death, the, libretto, was, opened, to, a, competition, with, a, guarantee, that, the, winning, entry, would, be, premiered, by, the, imperial, mariinsky, theatre, tchaikovsky, was, declared, the, winner, but, at, the, 1876, premiere, the, opera, enjoyed, only, a, lukewarm, reception, after, tchaikovsky, s, death, rimsky, korsakov, wrote, the, opera, christmas, eve, based, on, the, same, story, other, works, of, this, period, include, the, variations, on, a, rococo, theme, for, cello, and, orchestra, the, third, and, fourth, symphonies, the, ballet, swan, lake, and, the, opera, eugene, onegin, tchaikovsky, remained, abroad, for, a, year, after, the, disintegration, of, his, marriage, during, this, time, he, completed, eugene, onegin, orchestrated, his, fourth, symphony, and, composed, the, violin, concerto, he, returned, briefly, to, the, moscow, conservatory, in, the, autumn, of, 1879, for, the, next, few, years, assured, of, a, regular, income, from, von, meck, he, traveled, incessantly, throughout, europe, and, rural, russia, mainly, alone, and, avoided, social, contact, whenever, possible, during, this, time, tchaikovsky, s, foreign, reputation, grew, and, a, positive, reassessment, of, his, music, also, took, place, in, russia, thanks, in, part, to, russian, novelist, fyodor, dostoevsky, s, call, for, universal, unity, with, the, west, at, the, unveiling, of, the, pushkin, monument, in, moscow, in, 1880, before, dostoevsky, s, speech, tchaikovsky, s, music, had, been, considered, overly, dependent, on, the, west, as, dostoevsky, s, message, spread, throughout, russia, this, stigma, toward, tchaikovsky, s, music, evaporated, the, unprecedented, acclaim, for, him, even, drew, a, cult, following, among, the, young, intelligentsia, of, saint, petersburg, including, alexandre, benois, l, on, bakst, and, sergei, diaghilev, two, musical, works, from, this, period, stand, out, with, the, cathedral, of, christ, the, saviour, nearing, completion, in, moscow, in, 1880, the, 25th, anniversary, of, the, coronation, of, alexander, ii, in, 1881, and, the, 1882, moscow, arts, and, industry, exhibition, in, the, planning, stage, nikolai, rubinstein, suggested, that, tchaikovsky, compose, a, grand, commemorative, piece, tchaikovsky, agreed, and, finished, it, within, six, weeks, he, wrote, to, nadezhda, von, meck, that, this, piece, the, 1812, overture, would, be, very, loud, and, noisy, but, i, wrote, it, with, no, warm, feeling, of, love, and, therefore, there, will, probably, be, no, artistic, merits, in, it, he, also, warned, conductor, eduard, n, pravn, k, that, i, shan, t, be, at, all, surprised, and, offended, if, you, find, that, it, is, in, a, style, unsuitable, for, symphony, concerts, nevertheless, the, overture, became, for, many, the, piece, by, tchaikovsky, they, know, best, particularly, well, known, for, the, use, of, cannon, in, the, scores, on, 23, march, 1881, nikolai, rubinstein, died, in, paris, that, december, tchaikovsky, started, work, on, his, piano, trio, in, a, minor, dedicated, to, the, memory, of, a, great, artist, first, performed, privately, at, the, moscow, conservatory, on, the, first, anniversary, of, rubinstein, s, death, the, piece, became, extremely, popular, during, the, composer, s, lifetime, in, november, 1893, it, would, become, tchaikovsky, s, own, elegy, at, memorial, concerts, in, moscow, and, st, petersburg, in, 1884, tchaikovsky, began, to, shed, his, unsociability, and, restlessness, that, march, emperor, alexander, iii, conferred, upon, him, the, order, of, saint, vladimir, fourth, class, which, included, a, title, of, hereditary, nobility, and, a, personal, audience, with, the, tsar, this, was, seen, as, a, seal, of, official, approval, which, advanced, tchaikovsky, s, social, standing, and, might, have, been, cemented, in, the, composer, s, mind, by, the, success, of, his, orchestral, suite, no, 3, at, its, january, 1885, premiere, in, saint, petersburg, in, 1885, alexander, iii, requested, a, new, production, of, eugene, onegin, at, the, bolshoi, kamenny, theatre, in, saint, petersburg, by, having, the, opera, staged, there, and, not, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, he, served, notice, that, tchaikovsky, s, music, was, replacing, italian, opera, as, the, official, imperial, art, in, addition, at, the, instigation, of, ivan, vsevolozhsky, director, of, the, imperial, theaters, and, a, patron, of, the, composer, tchaikovsky, was, awarded, a, lifetime, annual, pension, of, 3, 000, rubles, from, the, tsar, this, made, him, the, premier, court, composer, in, practice, if, not, in, the, actual, title, despite, tchaikovsky, s, disdain, for, public, life, he, now, participated, in, it, as, part, of, his, increasing, celebrity, and, out, of, a, duty, he, felt, to, promote, russian, music, he, helped, support, his, former, pupil, sergei, taneyev, who, was, now, director, of, moscow, conservatory, by, attending, student, examinations, and, negotiating, the, sometimes, sensitive, relations, among, various, members, of, the, staff, he, served, as, director, of, the, moscow, branch, of, the, russian, musical, society, during, the, 1889, 1890, season, in, this, post, he, invited, many, international, celebrities, to, conduct, including, johannes, brahms, anton, n, dvo, k, and, jules, massenet, during, this, period, tchaikovsky, also, began, promoting, russian, music, as, a, conductor, in, january, 1887, he, substituted, on, short, notice, at, the, bolshoi, theater, in, moscow, for, performances, of, his, opera, cherevichki, within, a, year, he, was, in, considerable, demand, throughout, europe, and, russia, these, appearances, helped, him, overcome, life, long, stage, fright, and, boosted, his, self, assurance, in, 1888, tchaikovsky, led, the, premiere, of, his, fifth, symphony, in, saint, petersburg, repeating, the, work, a, week, later, with, the, first, performance, of, his, tone, poem, hamlet, although, critics, proved, hostile, with, c, sar, cui, calling, the, symphony, routine, and, meretricious, both, works, were, received, with, extreme, enthusiasm, by, audiences, and, tchaikovsky, undeterred, continued, to, conduct, the, symphony, in, russia, and, europe, conducting, brought, him, to, the, united, states, in, 1891, where, he, led, the, new, york, music, society, s, orchestra, in, his, festival, coronation, march, at, the, inaugural, concert, of, carnegie, hall, in, november, 1887, tchaikovsky, arrived, at, saint, petersburg, in, time, to, hear, several, of, the, russian, symphony, concerts, devoted, exclusively, to, the, music, of, russian, composers, one, included, the, first, complete, performance, of, his, revised, first, symphony, another, featured, the, final, version, of, third, symphony, of, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, with, whose, circle, tchaikovsky, was, already, in, touch, rimsky, korsakov, with, alexander, glazunov, anatoly, lyadov, and, several, other, nationalistically, minded, composers, and, musicians, had, formed, a, group, known, as, the, belyayev, circle, named, after, a, merchant, and, amateur, musician, who, became, an, influential, music, patron, and, publisher, tchaikovsky, spent, much, time, in, this, circle, becoming, far, more, at, ease, with, them, than, he, had, been, with, the, five, and, increasingly, confident, in, showcasing, his, music, alongside, theirs, this, relationship, lasted, until, tchaikovsky, s, death, in, 1892, tchaikovsky, was, voted, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, des, beaux, arts, in, france, only, the, second, russian, subject, to, be, so, honored, the, first, was, sculptor, mark, antokolsky, the, following, year, the, university, of, cambridge, in, england, awarded, tchaikovsky, an, honorary, doctor, of, music, degree, discussion, of, tchaikovsky, s, personal, life, especially, his, sexuality, has, perhaps, been, among, the, most, extensive, of, any, composer, in, the, 19th, century, and, certainly, of, any, russian, composer, of, his, time, it, has, also, at, times, caused, considerable, confusion, from, soviet, efforts, to, expunge, all, references, to, homosexuality, and, portray, him, as, a, heterosexual, to, efforts, at, analysis, by, western, biographers, biographers, have, generally, agreed, that, tchaikovsky, was, homosexual, he, sought, the, company, of, other, men, in, his, circle, for, extended, periods, associating, openly, and, establishing, professional, connections, with, them, his, first, love, was, reportedly, sergey, kireyev, a, younger, fellow, student, at, the, imperial, school, of, jurisprudence, according, to, modest, tchaikovsky, this, was, pyotr, ilyich, s, strongest, longest, and, purest, love, tchaikovsky, s, dedication, of, his, sixth, symphony, to, his, nephew, vladimir, bob, davydov, 21, at, the, time, and, his, feelings, expressed, about, davydov, in, letters, to, others, especially, following, davydov, s, suicide, has, been, cited, as, evidence, for, romantic, love, between, the, two, the, degree, to, which, the, composer, might, have, felt, comfortable, with, his, sexual, desires, has, however, remained, open, to, debate, it, is, still, unknown, whether, tchaikovsky, according, to, musicologist, and, biographer, david, brown, felt, tainted, within, himself, defiled, by, something, from, which, he, finally, realized, he, could, never, escape, or, whether, according, to, alexander, poznansky, he, experienced, no, unbearable, guilt, over, his, sexual, desires, and, eventually, came, to, see, his, sexual, peculiarities, as, an, insurmountable, and, even, natural, part, of, his, personality, without, experiencing, any, serious, psychological, damage, relevant, portions, of, his, brother, modest, s, autobiography, where, he, tells, of, the, composer, s, same, sex, attraction, have, been, published, as, have, letters, previously, suppressed, by, soviet, censors, in, which, tchaikovsky, openly, writes, of, it, such, censorship, has, persisted, in, the, russian, government, resulting, in, many, officials, including, the, former, culture, minister, vladimir, medinsky, denying, his, homosexuality, outright, passages, in, tchaikovsky, s, letters, which, reveal, his, homosexual, desires, have, been, censored, in, russia, in, one, such, passage, he, said, of, a, homosexual, acquaintance, petashenka, used, to, drop, by, with, the, criminal, intention, of, observing, the, cadet, corps, which, is, right, opposite, our, windows, but, i, ve, been, trying, to, discourage, these, compromising, visits, and, with, some, success, in, another, one, he, wrote, after, our, walk, i, offered, him, some, money, which, was, refused, he, does, it, for, the, love, of, art, and, adores, men, with, beards, tchaikovsky, lived, as, a, bachelor, for, most, of, his, life, in, 1868, he, met, belgian, soprano, d, sir, e, art, t, with, whom, he, considered, marriage, but, owing, to, various, circumstances, the, relationship, ended, tchaikovsky, later, claimed, she, was, the, only, woman, he, ever, loved, in, 1877, at, the, age, of, 37, he, wed, a, former, student, antonina, miliukova, the, marriage, was, a, disaster, mismatched, psychologically, and, sexually, the, couple, lived, together, for, only, two, and, a, half, months, before, tchaikovsky, left, overwrought, emotionally, and, suffering, from, acute, writer, s, block, tchaikovsky, s, family, remained, supportive, of, him, during, this, crisis, and, throughout, his, life, tchaikovsky, s, marital, debacle, may, have, forced, him, to, face, the, full, truth, about, his, sexuality, he, never, blamed, antonina, for, the, failure, of, their, marriage, tchaikovsky, was, also, aided, by, nadezhda, von, meck, the, widow, of, a, railway, magnate, who, had, begun, contact, with, him, not, long, before, the, marriage, as, well, as, an, important, friend, and, emotional, support, she, became, his, patroness, for, the, next, 13, years, which, allowed, him, to, focus, exclusively, on, composition, although, tchaikovsky, called, her, his, best, friend, they, agreed, never, to, meet, under, any, circumstances, on, 16, 28, october, 1893, tchaikovsky, conducted, the, premiere, of, his, sixth, symphony, the, path, tique, in, saint, petersburg, nine, days, later, on, 6, november, tchaikovsky, died, there, aged, 53, he, was, interred, in, tikhvin, cemetery, at, the, alexander, nevsky, monastery, near, the, graves, of, fellow, composers, alexander, borodin, mikhail, glinka, and, modest, mussorgsky, later, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, and, mily, balakirev, were, also, buried, nearby, tchaikovsky, s, death, is, attributed, to, cholera, caused, by, drinking, unboiled, water, at, a, local, restaurant, in, the, 1980s, in, britain, however, there, was, academic, speculation, that, he, killed, himself, either, with, poison, or, by, contracting, cholera, intentionally, in, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, roland, john, wiley, wrote, the, polemics, over, tchaikovsky, s, death, have, reached, an, impasse, as, for, illness, problems, of, evidence, offer, little, hope, of, satisfactory, resolution, the, state, of, diagnosis, the, confusion, of, witnesses, disregard, of, long, term, effects, of, smoking, and, alcohol, we, do, not, know, how, tchaikovsky, died, we, may, never, find, out, of, tchaikovsky, s, western, predecessors, robert, schumann, stands, out, as, an, influence, in, formal, structure, harmonic, practices, and, piano, writing, according, to, brown, and, musicologist, roland, john, wiley, boris, asafyev, comments, that, schumann, left, his, mark, on, tchaikovsky, not, just, as, a, formal, influence, but, also, as, an, example, of, musical, dramaturgy, and, self, expression, leon, botstein, argues, the, music, of, franz, liszt, and, richard, wagner, also, left, their, imprints, on, tchaikovsky, s, orchestral, style, the, late, romantic, trend, for, writing, orchestral, suites, begun, by, franz, lachner, jules, massenet, and, joachim, raff, after, the, rediscovery, of, bach, s, works, in, that, genre, may, have, influenced, tchaikovsky, to, try, his, own, hand, at, them, tchaikovsky, s, teacher, anton, rubinstein, s, opera, the, demon, became, a, model, for, the, final, tableau, of, eugene, onegin, so, did, l, o, delibes, ballets, copp, lia, and, sylvia, for, the, sleeping, beauty, and, georges, bizet, s, opera, carmen, a, work, tchaikovsky, admired, tremendously, for, the, queen, of, spades, otherwise, it, was, to, composers, of, the, past, that, tchaikovsky, turned, beethoven, whose, music, he, respected, mozart, whose, music, he, loved, glinka, whose, opera, a, life, for, the, tsar, made, an, indelible, impression, on, him, as, a, child, and, whose, scoring, he, studied, assiduously, and, adolphe, adam, whose, ballet, giselle, was, a, favorite, of, his, from, his, student, days, and, whose, score, he, consulted, while, working, on, the, sleeping, beauty, beethoven, s, string, quartets, may, have, influenced, tchaikovsky, s, attempts, in, that, medium, other, composers, whose, work, interested, tchaikovsky, included, hector, berlioz, felix, mendelssohn, giacomo, meyerbeer, gioachino, rossini, giuseppe, verdi, vincenzo, bellini, carl, maria, von, weber, and, henry, litolff, tchaikovsky, displayed, a, wide, stylistic, and, emotional, range, from, light, salon, works, to, grand, symphonies, some, of, his, works, such, as, the, variations, on, a, rococo, theme, employ, a, classical, form, reminiscent, of, 18th, century, composers, such, as, mozart, his, favorite, composer, other, compositions, such, as, his, little, russian, symphony, and, his, opera, vakula, the, smith, flirt, with, musical, practices, more, akin, to, those, of, the, five, especially, in, their, use, of, folk, song, other, works, such, as, tchaikovsky, s, last, three, symphonies, employ, a, personal, musical, idiom, that, facilitated, intense, emotional, expression, american, music, critic, and, journalist, harold, c, schonberg, wrote, of, tchaikovsky, s, sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous, fund, of, melody, a, feature, that, has, ensured, his, music, s, continued, success, with, audiences, tchaikovsky, s, complete, range, of, melodic, styles, was, as, wide, as, that, of, his, compositions, sometimes, he, used, western, style, melodies, sometimes, original, melodies, written, in, the, style, of, russian, folk, song, sometimes, he, used, actual, folk, songs, according, to, the, new, grove, tchaikovsky, s, melodic, gift, could, also, become, his, worst, enemy, in, two, ways, the, first, challenge, arose, from, his, ethnic, heritage, unlike, western, themes, the, melodies, that, russian, composers, wrote, tended, to, be, self, contained, they, functioned, with, a, mindset, of, stasis, and, repetition, rather, than, one, of, progress, and, ongoing, development, on, a, technical, level, it, made, modulating, to, a, new, key, to, introduce, a, contrasting, second, theme, exceedingly, difficult, as, this, was, literally, a, foreign, concept, that, did, not, exist, in, russian, music, the, second, way, melody, worked, against, tchaikovsky, was, a, challenge, that, he, shared, with, the, majority, of, romantic, age, composers, they, did, not, write, in, the, regular, symmetrical, melodic, shapes, that, worked, well, with, sonata, form, such, as, those, favored, by, classical, composers, such, as, haydn, mozart, or, beethoven, rather, the, themes, favored, by, romantics, were, complete, and, independent, in, themselves, this, completeness, hindered, their, use, as, structural, elements, in, combination, with, one, another, this, challenge, was, why, the, romantics, were, never, natural, symphonists, all, a, composer, like, tchaikovsky, could, do, with, them, was, to, essentially, repeat, them, even, when, he, modified, them, to, generate, tension, maintain, interest, and, satisfy, listeners, harmony, could, be, a, potential, trap, for, tchaikovsky, according, to, brown, since, russian, creativity, tended, to, focus, on, inertia, and, self, enclosed, tableaux, while, western, harmony, worked, against, this, to, propel, the, music, onward, and, on, a, larger, scale, shape, it, modulation, the, shifting, from, one, key, to, another, was, a, driving, principle, in, both, harmony, and, sonata, form, the, primary, western, large, scale, musical, structure, since, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, modulation, maintained, harmonic, interest, over, an, extended, time, scale, provided, a, clear, contrast, between, musical, themes, and, showed, how, those, themes, were, related, to, each, other, one, point, in, tchaikovsky, s, favor, was, a, flair, for, harmony, that, astonished, rudolph, k, ndinger, tchaikovsky, s, music, tutor, during, his, time, at, the, school, of, jurisprudence, added, to, what, he, learned, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, studies, this, talent, allowed, tchaikovsky, to, employ, a, varied, range, of, harmony, in, his, music, from, the, western, harmonic, and, textural, practices, of, his, first, two, string, quartets, to, the, use, of, the, whole, tone, scale, in, the, center, of, the, finale, of, the, second, symphony, a, practice, more, typically, used, by, the, five, rhythmically, tchaikovsky, sometimes, experimented, with, unusual, meters, more, often, he, used, a, firm, regular, meter, a, practice, that, served, him, well, in, dance, music, at, times, his, rhythms, became, pronounced, enough, to, become, the, main, expressive, agent, of, the, music, they, also, became, a, means, found, typically, in, russian, folk, music, of, simulating, movement, or, progression, in, large, scale, symphonic, movements, a, synthetic, propulsion, as, brown, phrases, it, which, substituted, for, the, momentum, that, would, be, created, in, strict, sonata, form, by, the, interaction, of, melodic, or, motivic, elements, this, interaction, generally, does, not, take, place, in, russian, music, for, more, on, this, please, see, repetition, below, tchaikovsky, struggled, with, sonata, form, its, principle, of, organic, growth, through, the, interplay, of, musical, themes, was, alien, to, russian, practice, the, traditional, argument, that, tchaikovsky, seemed, unable, to, develop, themes, in, this, manner, fails, to, consider, this, point, it, also, discounts, the, possibility, that, tchaikovsky, might, have, intended, the, development, passages, in, his, large, scale, works, to, act, as, enforced, hiatuses, to, build, tension, rather, than, grow, organically, as, smoothly, progressive, musical, arguments, according, to, brown, and, musicologists, hans, keller, and, daniel, zhitomirsky, tchaikovsky, found, his, solution, to, large, scale, structure, while, composing, the, fourth, symphony, he, essentially, sidestepped, thematic, interaction, and, kept, sonata, form, only, as, an, outline, as, zhitomirsky, phrases, it, within, this, outline, the, focus, centered, on, periodic, alternation, and, juxtaposition, tchaikovsky, placed, blocks, of, dissimilar, tonal, and, thematic, material, alongside, one, another, with, what, keller, calls, new, and, violent, contrasts, between, musical, themes, keys, and, harmonies, this, process, according, to, brown, and, keller, builds, momentum, and, adds, intense, drama, while, the, result, warrack, charges, is, still, an, ingenious, episodic, treatment, of, two, tunes, rather, than, a, symphonic, development, of, them, in, the, germanic, sense, brown, counters, that, it, took, the, listener, of, the, period, through, a, succession, of, often, highly, charged, sections, which, added, up, to, a, radically, new, kind, of, symphonic, experience, italics, brown, one, that, functioned, not, on, the, basis, of, summation, as, austro, german, symphonies, did, but, on, one, of, accumulation, partly, owing, to, the, melodic, and, structural, intricacies, involved, in, this, accumulation, and, partly, due, to, the, composer, s, nature, tchaikovsky, s, music, became, intensely, expressive, this, intensity, was, entirely, new, to, russian, music, and, prompted, some, russians, to, place, tchaikovsky, s, name, alongside, that, of, dostoevsky, german, musicologist, hermann, kretzschmar, credits, tchaikovsky, in, his, later, symphonies, with, offering, full, images, of, life, developed, freely, sometimes, even, dramatically, around, psychological, contrasts, this, music, has, the, mark, of, the, truly, lived, and, felt, experience, leon, botstein, in, elaborating, on, this, comment, suggests, that, listening, to, tchaikovsky, s, music, became, a, psychological, mirror, connected, to, everyday, experience, one, that, reflected, on, the, dynamic, nature, of, the, listener, s, own, emotional, self, this, active, engagement, with, the, music, opened, for, the, listener, a, vista, of, emotional, and, psychological, tension, and, an, extremity, of, feeling, that, possessed, relevance, because, it, seemed, reminiscent, of, one, s, own, truly, lived, and, felt, experience, or, one, s, search, for, intensity, in, a, deeply, personal, sense, as, mentioned, above, repetition, was, a, natural, part, of, tchaikovsky, s, music, just, as, it, is, an, integral, part, of, russian, music, his, use, of, sequences, within, melodies, repeating, a, tune, at, a, higher, or, lower, pitch, in, the, same, voice, could, go, on, for, extreme, length, the, problem, with, repetition, is, that, over, a, period, of, time, the, melody, being, repeated, remains, static, even, when, there, is, a, surface, level, of, rhythmic, activity, added, to, it, tchaikovsky, kept, the, musical, conversation, flowing, by, treating, melody, tonality, rhythm, and, sound, color, as, one, integrated, unit, rather, than, as, separate, elements, by, making, subtle, but, noticeable, changes, in, the, rhythm, or, phrasing, of, a, tune, modulating, to, another, key, changing, the, melody, itself, or, varying, the, instruments, playing, it, tchaikovsky, could, keep, a, listener, s, interest, from, flagging, by, extending, the, number, of, repetitions, he, could, increase, the, musical, and, dramatic, tension, of, a, passage, building, into, an, emotional, experience, of, almost, unbearable, intensity, as, brown, phrases, it, controlling, when, the, peak, and, release, of, that, tension, would, take, place, musicologist, martin, cooper, calls, this, practice, a, subtle, form, of, unifying, a, piece, of, music, and, adds, that, tchaikovsky, brought, it, to, a, high, point, of, refinement, for, more, on, this, practice, see, the, next, section, like, other, late, romantic, composers, tchaikovsky, relied, heavily, on, orchestration, for, musical, effects, tchaikovsky, however, became, noted, for, the, sensual, opulence, and, voluptuous, timbrel, virtuosity, of, his, orchestration, like, glinka, tchaikovsky, tended, toward, bright, primary, colors, and, sharply, delineated, contrasts, of, texture, however, beginning, with, the, third, symphony, tchaikovsky, experimented, with, an, increased, range, of, timbres, tchaikovsky, s, scoring, was, noted, and, admired, by, some, of, his, peers, rimsky, korsakov, regularly, referred, his, students, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, to, it, and, called, it, devoid, of, all, striving, after, effect, give, a, healthy, beautiful, sonority, this, sonority, musicologist, richard, taruskin, pointed, out, is, essentially, germanic, in, effect, tchaikovsky, s, expert, use, of, having, two, or, more, instruments, play, a, melody, simultaneously, a, practice, called, doubling, and, his, ear, for, uncanny, combinations, of, instruments, resulted, in, a, generalized, orchestral, sonority, in, which, the, individual, timbres, of, the, instruments, being, thoroughly, mixed, would, vanish, in, works, like, the, serenade, for, strings, and, the, variations, on, a, rococo, theme, tchaikovsky, showed, he, was, highly, gifted, at, writing, in, a, style, of, 18th, century, european, pastiche, tchaikovsky, graduated, from, imitation, to, full, scale, evocation, in, the, ballet, the, sleeping, beauty, and, the, opera, the, queen, of, spades, this, practice, which, alexandre, benois, calls, pass, ism, lends, an, air, of, timelessness, and, immediacy, making, the, past, seem, as, though, it, were, the, present, on, a, practical, level, tchaikovsky, was, drawn, to, past, styles, because, he, felt, he, might, find, the, solution, to, certain, structural, problems, within, them, his, rococo, pastiches, also, may, have, offered, escape, into, a, musical, world, purer, than, his, own, into, which, he, felt, himself, irresistibly, drawn, in, this, sense, tchaikovsky, operated, in, the, opposite, manner, to, igor, stravinsky, who, turned, to, neoclassicism, partly, as, a, form, of, compositional, self, discovery, tchaikovsky, s, attraction, to, ballet, might, have, allowed, a, similar, refuge, into, a, fairy, tale, world, where, he, could, freely, write, dance, music, within, a, tradition, of, french, elegance, maes, maintains, that, regardless, of, what, he, was, writing, tchaikovsky, s, main, concern, was, how, his, music, impacted, his, listeners, on, an, aesthetic, level, at, specific, moments, in, the, piece, and, on, a, cumulative, level, once, the, music, had, finished, what, his, listeners, experienced, on, an, emotional, or, visceral, level, became, an, end, in, itself, tchaikovsky, s, focus, on, pleasing, his, audience, might, be, considered, closer, to, that, of, mendelssohn, or, mozart, considering, that, he, lived, and, worked, in, what, was, probably, the, last, 19th, century, feudal, nation, the, statement, is, not, actually, that, surprising, and, yet, even, when, writing, so, called, programme, music, for, example, his, romeo, and, juliet, fantasy, overture, he, cast, it, in, sonata, form, his, use, of, stylized, 18th, century, melodies, and, patriotic, themes, was, geared, toward, the, values, of, russian, aristocracy, he, was, aided, in, this, by, ivan, vsevolozhsky, who, commissioned, the, sleeping, beauty, from, tchaikovsky, and, the, libretto, for, the, queen, of, spades, from, modest, with, their, use, of, 18th, century, settings, stipulated, firmly, tchaikovsky, also, used, the, polonaise, frequently, the, dance, being, a, musical, code, for, the, romanov, dynasty, and, a, symbol, of, russian, patriotism, using, it, in, the, finale, of, a, work, could, assure, its, success, with, russian, listeners, tchaikovsky, s, relationship, with, collaborators, was, mixed, like, nikolai, rubinstein, with, the, first, piano, concerto, virtuoso, and, pedagogue, leopold, auer, rejected, the, violin, concerto, initially, but, changed, his, mind, he, played, it, to, great, public, success, and, taught, it, to, his, students, who, included, jascha, heifetz, and, nathan, milstein, wilhelm, fitzenhagen, intervened, considerably, in, shaping, what, he, considered, his, piece, the, variations, on, a, rococo, theme, according, to, music, critic, michael, steinberg, tchaikovsky, was, angered, by, fitzenhagen, s, license, but, did, nothing, the, rococo, variations, were, published, with, the, cellist, s, amendments, his, collaboration, on, the, three, ballets, went, better, and, in, marius, petipa, who, worked, with, him, on, the, last, two, he, might, have, found, an, advocate, when, the, sleeping, beauty, was, seen, by, its, dancers, as, needlessly, complicated, petipa, convinced, them, to, put, in, the, extra, effort, tchaikovsky, compromised, to, make, his, music, as, practical, as, possible, for, the, dancers, and, was, accorded, more, creative, freedom, than, ballet, composers, were, usually, accorded, at, the, time, he, responded, with, scores, that, minimized, the, rhythmic, subtleties, normally, present, in, his, work, but, were, inventive, and, rich, in, melody, with, more, refined, and, imaginative, orchestration, than, in, the, average, ballet, score, critical, reception, to, tchaikovsky, s, music, was, varied, but, also, improved, over, time, even, after, 1880, some, inside, russia, held, it, suspect, for, not, being, nationalistic, enough, and, thought, western, european, critics, lauded, it, for, exactly, that, reason, there, might, have, been, a, grain, of, truth, in, the, latter, according, to, musicologist, and, conductor, leon, botstein, as, german, critics, especially, wrote, of, the, indeterminacy, of, artistic, character, being, truly, at, home, in, the, non, russian, of, the, foreign, critics, who, did, not, care, for, his, music, eduard, hanslick, lambasted, the, violin, concerto, as, a, musical, composition, whose, stink, one, can, hear, and, william, forster, abtrop, wrote, of, the, fifth, symphony, the, furious, peroration, sounds, like, nothing, so, much, as, a, horde, of, demons, struggling, in, a, torrent, of, brandy, the, music, growing, drunker, and, drunker, pandemonium, delirium, tremens, raving, and, above, all, noise, worse, confounded, the, division, between, russian, and, western, critics, remained, through, much, of, the, 20th, century, but, for, a, different, reason, according, to, brown, and, wiley, the, prevailing, view, of, western, critics, was, that, the, same, qualities, in, tchaikovsky, s, music, that, appealed, to, audiences, its, strong, emotions, directness, and, eloquence, and, colorful, orchestration, added, up, to, compositional, shallowness, the, music, s, use, in, popular, and, film, music, brown, says, lowered, its, esteem, in, their, eyes, still, further, there, was, also, the, fact, pointed, out, earlier, that, tchaikovsky, s, music, demanded, active, engagement, from, the, listener, and, as, botstein, phrases, it, spoke, to, the, listener, s, imaginative, interior, life, regardless, of, nationality, conservative, critics, he, adds, may, have, felt, threatened, by, the, violence, and, hysteria, they, detected, and, felt, such, emotive, displays, attacked, the, boundaries, of, conventional, aesthetic, appreciation, the, cultured, reception, of, art, as, an, act, of, formalist, discernment, and, the, polite, engagement, of, art, as, an, act, of, amusement, there, has, also, been, the, fact, that, the, composer, did, not, follow, sonata, form, strictly, relying, instead, on, juxtaposing, blocks, of, tonalities, and, thematic, groups, maes, states, this, point, has, been, seen, at, times, as, a, weakness, rather, than, a, sign, of, originality, even, with, what, schonberg, termed, a, professional, reevaluation, of, tchaikovsky, s, work, the, practice, of, faulting, tchaikovsky, for, not, following, in, the, steps, of, the, viennese, masters, has, not, gone, away, entirely, while, his, intention, of, writing, music, that, would, please, his, audiences, is, also, sometimes, taken, to, task, in, a, 1992, article, new, york, times, critic, allan, kozinn, writes, it, is, tchaikovsky, s, flexibility, after, all, that, has, given, us, a, sense, of, his, variability, tchaikovsky, was, capable, of, turning, out, music, entertaining, and, widely, beloved, though, it, is, that, seems, superficial, manipulative, and, trivial, when, regarded, in, the, context, of, the, whole, literature, the, first, piano, concerto, is, a, case, in, point, it, makes, a, joyful, noise, it, swims, in, pretty, tunes, and, its, dramatic, rhetoric, allows, or, even, requires, a, soloist, to, make, a, grand, swashbuckling, impression, but, it, is, entirely, hollow, in, the, 21st, century, however, critics, are, reacting, more, positively, to, tchaikovsky, s, tunefulness, originality, and, craftsmanship, tchaikovsky, is, being, viewed, again, as, a, composer, of, the, first, rank, writing, music, of, depth, innovation, and, influence, according, to, cultural, historian, and, author, joseph, horowitz, important, in, this, reevaluation, is, a, shift, in, attitude, away, from, the, disdain, for, overt, emotionalism, that, marked, half, of, the, 20th, century, we, have, acquired, a, different, view, of, romantic, excess, horowitz, says, tchaikovsky, is, today, more, admired, than, deplored, for, his, emotional, frankness, if, his, music, seems, harried, and, insecure, so, are, we, all, horowitz, maintains, that, while, the, standing, of, tchaikovsky, s, music, has, fluctuated, among, critics, for, the, public, it, never, went, out, of, style, and, his, most, popular, works, have, yielded, iconic, sound, bytes, such, as, the, love, theme, from, romeo, and, juliet, along, with, those, tunes, botstein, adds, tchaikovsky, appealed, to, audiences, outside, of, russia, with, an, immediacy, and, directness, that, were, startling, even, for, music, an, art, form, often, associated, with, emotion, tchaikovsky, s, melodies, stated, with, eloquence, and, matched, by, his, inventive, use, of, harmony, and, orchestration, have, always, ensured, audience, appeal, his, popularity, is, considered, secure, with, his, following, in, many, countries, including, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, second, only, to, that, of, beethoven, his, music, has, also, been, used, frequently, in, popular, music, and, film, according, to, wiley, tchaikovsky, was, a, pioneer, in, several, ways, thanks, in, large, part, to, nadezhda, von, meck, wiley, writes, he, became, the, first, full, time, professional, russian, composer, this, wiley, adds, allowed, him, the, time, and, freedom, to, consolidate, the, western, compositional, practices, he, had, learned, at, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, with, russian, folk, song, and, other, native, musical, elements, to, fulfill, his, own, expressive, goals, and, forge, an, original, deeply, personal, style, he, made, an, impact, in, not, only, complete, works, such, as, the, symphony, but, also, program, music, and, as, wiley, phrases, it, transformed, liszt, s, and, berlioz, s, achievements, into, matters, of, shakespearean, elevation, and, psychological, import, wiley, and, holden, both, note, that, tchaikovsky, did, all, this, without, a, native, school, of, composition, upon, which, to, fall, back, they, point, out, that, only, glinka, had, preceded, him, in, combining, russian, and, western, practices, and, his, teachers, in, saint, petersburg, had, been, thoroughly, germanic, in, their, musical, outlook, he, was, they, write, for, all, intents, and, purposes, alone, in, his, artistic, quest, maes, and, taruskin, write, that, tchaikovsky, believed, that, his, professionalism, in, combining, skill, and, high, standards, in, his, musical, works, separated, him, from, his, contemporaries, in, the, five, maes, adds, that, like, them, he, wanted, to, produce, music, that, reflected, russian, national, character, but, which, did, so, to, the, highest, european, standards, of, quality, tchaikovsky, according, to, maes, came, along, at, a, time, when, the, nation, itself, was, deeply, divided, as, to, what, that, character, truly, was, like, his, country, maes, writes, it, took, him, time, to, discover, how, to, express, his, russianness, in, a, way, that, was, true, to, himself, and, what, he, had, learned, because, of, his, professionalism, maes, says, he, worked, hard, at, this, goal, and, succeeded, the, composer, s, friend, music, critic, herman, laroche, wrote, of, the, sleeping, beauty, that, the, score, contained, an, element, deeper, and, more, general, than, color, in, the, internal, structure, of, the, music, above, all, in, the, foundation, of, the, element, of, melody, this, basic, element, is, undoubtedly, russian, tchaikovsky, was, inspired, to, reach, beyond, russia, with, his, music, according, to, maes, and, taruskin, his, exposure, to, western, music, they, write, encouraged, him, to, think, it, belonged, to, not, just, russia, but, also, the, world, at, large, volkov, adds, that, this, mindset, made, him, think, seriously, about, russia, s, place, in, european, musical, culture, the, first, russian, composer, to, do, so, it, steeled, him, to, become, the, first, russian, composer, to, acquaint, foreign, audiences, personally, with, his, own, works, warrack, writes, as, well, as, those, of, other, russian, composers, in, his, biography, of, tchaikovsky, anthony, holden, recalls, the, dearth, of, russian, classical, music, before, tchaikovsky, s, birth, then, places, the, composer, s, achievements, into, historical, perspective, twenty, years, after, tchaikovsky, s, death, in, 1913, igor, stravinsky, s, the, rite, of, spring, erupted, onto, the, musical, scene, signaling, russia, s, arrival, into, 20th, century, music, between, these, two, very, different, worlds, tchaikovsky, s, music, became, the, sole, bridge, a, recording, was, made, in, moscow, in, january, 1890, by, julius, block, on, behalf, of, thomas, edison, a, transcript, of, the, recording, follows, identification, of, the, speakers, is, speculative, according, to, musicologist, leonid, sabaneyev, tchaikovsky, was, not, comfortable, with, being, recorded, for, posterity, and, tried, to, shy, away, from, it, on, an, apparently, separate, visit, from, the, one, related, above, block, asked, the, composer, to, play, something, on, a, piano, or, at, least, say, something, tchaikovsky, refused, he, told, block, i, am, a, bad, pianist, and, my, voice, is, raspy, why, should, one, eternalize, it
