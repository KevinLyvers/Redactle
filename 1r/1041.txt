with, varying, success, against, the, roman, empire, under, two, emperors, after, raiding, south, across, the, danube, he, defeated, a, roman, invasion, in, the, reign, of, domitian, securing, a, period, of, independence, during, which, decebalus, consolidated, his, rule, when, trajan, came, to, power, his, armies, invaded, dacia, to, weaken, its, threat, to, the, roman, border, territories, of, moesia, decebalus, was, defeated, in, 102, ad, and, his, own, sister, was, abducted, within, this, timeframe, and, forcibly, wed, into, roman, nobility, causing, some, historians, to, infer, that, she, was, the, ancestress, of, the, usurper, regalianus, who, claimed, to, be, a, kinsman, of, decebalus, he, remained, in, power, as, a, client, king, but, continued, to, assert, his, independence, leading, to, a, final, and, overwhelming, roman, invasion, north, of, the, danube, in, 105, ad, trajan, reduced, the, dacian, capital, sarmizegetusa, to, ruins, in, 106, ad, absorbing, some, of,

about, decebalus, youth, or, background, decebalus, appears, to, have, risen, to, prominence, in, the, court, of, the, dacian, king, duras, who, claimed, authority, over, all, dacian, territory, an, ancient, dacian, pot, bearing, the, words, decebalus, per, scorilo, led, to, the, suggestion, that, this, might, mean, decebalus, son, of, scorilo, according, to, lucian, boia, this, suggestion, was, originally, a, scholarly, joke, but, the, theory, has, been, considered, plausible, by, several, writers, it, has, been, suggested, that, scorilo, may, be, identical, to, the, coryllus, or, scorillus, identified, by, jordanes, as, a, dacian, king, prior, to, duras, duras, may, have, been, decebalus, uncle, having, taken, over, the, throne, by, agnatic, right, on, his, brother, s, death, in, 85, ad, the, dacian, army, began, minor, raids, upon, the, heavily, fortified, roman, province, of, moesia, located, south, of, the, danube, in, 86, king, duras, ordered, a, more, vigorous, attack, south, into, moesia, roman, sources, refer, to, the, attack, being, led, by, diurpaneus, or, dorpaneus, many, authors, have, taken, this, person, to, be, duras, himself, and, refer, to, him, as, duras, diurpaneus, other, scholars, argue, that, duras, and, diurpaneus, are, different, individuals, or, that, diurpaneus, is, identical, to, decebalus, recent, sources, take, the, view, that, diurpaneus, is, most, likely, decebalus, the, dacians, defeated, and, killed, oppius, sabinus, the, governor, of, moesia, forcing, domitian, to, deploy, more, troops, to, the, area, marcus, cornelius, nigrinus, replaced, sabinus, domitian, took, command, to, deal, with, the, problem, himself, arriving, with, his, general, prefect, of, the, praetorian, guards, cornelius, fuscus, domitian, pushed, back, the, dacians, from, moesia, then, returned, to, rome, to, celebrate, a, triumph, leaving, fuscus, in, charge, of, the, army, fuscus, advanced, into, dacia, but, his, four, or, five, legions, suffered, a, major, defeat, when, ambushed, by, the, forces, of, decebalus, the, sources, say, diurpaneus, was, in, command, which, might, mean, decebalus, or, duras, two, roman, legions, among, which, was, the, v, alaudae, were, ambushed, and, defeated, at, a, mountain, pass, the, romans, called, tapae, widely, known, as, the, iron, gates, of, transylvania, fuscus, was, killed, and, decebalus, was, crowned, king, after, the, ageing, duras, abdicated, dio, cassius, described, decebalus, as, follows, this, man, was, shrewd, in, his, understanding, of, warfare, and, shrewd, also, in, the, waging, of, war, he, judged, well, when, to, attack, and, chose, the, right, moment, to, retreat, he, was, an, expert, in, ambuscades, and, a, master, in, pitched, battles, and, he, knew, not, only, how, to, follow, up, a, victory, well, but, also, how, to, manage, well, a, defeat, hence, he, showed, himself, a, worthy, antagonist, of, the, romans, for, a, long, time, fuscus, was, replaced, by, tettius, julianus, in, 88, julianus, commanded, another, roman, army, under, domitian, against, the, dacians, defeating, them, in, a, battle, near, tapae, however, elsewhere, in, europe, domitian, was, having, to, deal, with, revolts, along, the, rhine, and, suffered, heavy, defeats, at, the, hands, of, the, marcomanni, and, sarmatian, tribes, in, the, east, notably, the, iazyges, needing, the, troops, in, moesia, domitian, agreed, to, peace, terms, with, decebalus, he, agreed, to, pay, large, sums, eight, million, sesterces, in, annual, tribute, to, the, dacians, for, maintaining, peace, decebalus, sent, his, brother, diegis, to, rome, to, accept, a, diadem, from, the, emperor, officially, recognising, decebalus, s, royal, status, decebalus, victory, greatly, increased, his, prestige, he, proceeded, to, centralize, power, and, build, up, his, fortifications, and, war, machines, using, engineers, supplied, by, domitian, decebalus, s, court, also, became, a, haven, for, malcontents, and, deserters, from, the, roman, empire, becoming, the, nucleus, for, anti, roman, sentiment, in, the, words, of, historian, julian, bennett, he, also, sought, to, build, alliances, with, independent, tribes, notably, the, getic, bastarnae, and, the, sarmatian, roxolani, he, failed, to, secure, the, support, of, the, quadi, marcomanni, and, jazyges, but, ensured, that, they, would, not, interfere, with, his, plans, when, trajan, came, to, power, in, 98, he, immediately, toured, the, danube, area, and, ordered, the, strengthening, of, fortifications, along, the, dacian, frontier, three, years, later, trajan, decided, to, launch, an, offensive, against, dacia, according, to, cassius, dio, this, was, because, he, had, taken, stock, of, previous, record, resented, the, annual, sums, of, money, they, were, getting, and, saw, that, their, powers, and, their, pride, were, on, the, increase, trajan, s, force, crossed, the, danube, in, 101, and, advanced, into, dacia, pushing, back, dacian, forces, according, to, dio, decebalus, sent, envoys, asking, for, negotiations, but, trajan, refused, a, personal, meeting, at, the, second, battle, of, tapae, decebalus, was, defeated, but, he, inflicted, serious, losses, on, the, romans, trajan, chose, not, to, pursue, the, war, until, the, spring, decebalus, tried, to, wrongfoot, trajan, by, launching, a, surprise, attack, on, moesia, but, he, suffered, a, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, adamclisi, despite, stiff, resistance, the, romans, closed, on, the, dacian, capital, by, early, 102, decebalus, was, forced, to, concede, defeat, and, accept, trajan, s, terms, which, included, the, loss, of, some, territories, in, the, vicinity, of, the, danube, and, the, dismantling, of, his, fortresses, however, decebalus, retained, his, throne, decebalus, had, no, intention, of, remaining, subject, to, rome, or, giving, up, his, lost, territory, as, soon, as, he, was, able, to, he, took, revenge, on, those, who, had, supported, rome, he, annexed, territory, from, the, jazyges, and, violated, the, peace, treaty, by, re, arming, and, receiving, refugees, and, deserters, from, roman, territory, he, also, restored, his, fortifications, this, time, decebalus, did, not, wait, for, trajan, to, strike, in, 105, he, authorised, a, direct, attack, on, the, newly, occupied, roman, territory, probably, the, fortress, at, banat, the, attack, seems, to, have, taken, trajan, and, the, senate, by, surprise, trajan, immediately, travelled, north, to, review, fortifications, meanwhile, decebalus, continued, to, disrupt, roman, positions, with, guerrilla, attacks, he, also, developed, a, plan, to, assassinate, trajan, by, using, roman, auxiliaries, who, had, defected, to, the, dacians, to, infiltrate, the, emperor, s, camp, the, plot, failed, however, he, succeeded, in, capturing, one, of, trajan, s, senior, officers, pompeius, longinus, whom, he, tried, to, use, as, a, hostage, to, bargain, with, trajan, longinus, took, poison, to, avoid, being, so, used, trajan, meanwhile, was, building, a, large, force, for, a, full, scale, invasion, decebalus, tried, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, but, trajan, demanded, that, decebalus, surrender, himself, which, he, refused, to, do, decebalus, allies, among, the, surrounding, tribes, seem, to, have, deserted, him, at, this, point, trajan, launched, a, direct, attack, on, the, dacian, capital, sarmizegetusa, after, a, long, siege, of, sarmizegetusa, and, a, few, skirmishes, in, the, nearby, region, the, romans, conquered, the, dacian, capital, decebalus, managed, to, escape, with, his, family, he, and, his, remaining, supporters, continued, a, guerrilla, campaign, in, the, carpathian, mountains, decebalus, was, hunted, down, and, finally, cornered, by, roman, detachments, seeking, his, head, rather, than, being, captured, only, to, be, exhibited, and, humiliated, at, rome, decebalus, committed, suicide, by, slashing, his, own, throat, as, depicted, on, trajan, s, column, spiral, 22, panel, b, it, is, likely, that, he, killed, himself, as, a, roman, cavalry, scout, named, tiberius, claudius, maximus, from, legio, vii, claudia, was, approaching, he, was, probably, still, alive, when, maximus, reached, him, as, is, claimed, on, maximus, funerary, stele, discovered, at, gramini, in, greece, maximus, is, presumably, the, figure, seen, on, trajan, s, column, reaching, out, to, decebalus, from, his, horse, decebalus, head, and, right, hand, were, then, taken, to, trajan, in, ranisstorum, an, unidentified, dacian, village, perhaps, piatra, craivii,

and, has, been, portrayed, in, numerous, literary, works, movies, public, sculptures, and, other, memorials, decebalus, began, to, be, seen, in, these, terms, during, the, 19th, century, when, he,
