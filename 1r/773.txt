mature, work, he, sought, to, develop, a, systematic, foundational, science, based, on, the, so, called, phenomenological, reduction, arguing, that, transcendental, consciousness, sets, the, limits, of, all, possible, knowledge, husserl, redefined, phenomenology, as, a, transcendental, idealist, philosophy, husserl, s, thought, profoundly, influenced, 20th, century, philosophy, and, he, remains,

testament, during, his, twenties, husserl, asked, to, be, baptized, into, the, lutheran, church, in, 1886, husserl, s, father, adolf, had, died, in, 1884, herbert, spiegelberg, writes, while, outward, religious, practice, never, entered, his, life, any, more, than, it, did, that, of, most, academic, scholars, of, the, time, his, mind, remained, open, for, the, religious, phenomenon, as, for, any, other, genuine, experience, at, times, husserl, saw, his, goal, as, one, of, moral, renewal, although, a, steadfast, proponent, of, a, radical, and, rational, autonomy, in, all, things, husserl, could, also, speak, about, his, vocation, and, even, about, his, mission, under, god, s, will, to, find, new, ways, for, philosophy, and, science, observes, spiegelberg, following, his, phd, in, mathematics, husserl, returned, to, berlin, to, work, as, the, assistant, to, karl, weierstrass, yet, already, husserl, had, felt, the, desire, to, pursue, philosophy, then, professor, weierstrass, became, very, ill, husserl, became, free, to, return, to, vienna, where, after, serving, a, short, military, duty, he, devoted, his, attention, to, philosophy, in, 1884, at, the, university, of, vienna, he, attended, the, lectures, of, franz, brentano, on, philosophy, and, philosophical, psychology, brentano, introduced, him, to, the, writings, of, bernard, bolzano, hermann, lotze, j, stuart, mill, and, david, hume, husserl, was, so, impressed, by, brentano, that, he, decided, to, dedicate, his, life, to, philosophy, indeed, franz, brentano, is, often, credited, as, being, his, most, important, influence, e, g, with, regard, to, intentionality, following, academic, advice, two, years, later, in, 1886, husserl, followed, carl, stumpf, a, former, student, of, brentano, to, the, university, of, halle, seeking, to, obtain, his, habilitation, which, would, qualify, him, to, teach, at, the, university, level, there, under, stumpf, s, supervision, he, wrote, ber, den, begriff, der, zahl, on, the, concept, of, number, in, 1887, which, would, serve, later, as, the, basis, for, his, first, important, work, philosophie, der, arithmetik, 1891, in, 1887, husserl, married, malvine, steinschneider, a, union, that, would, last, over, fifty, years, in, 1892, their, daughter, elizabeth, was, born, in, 1893, their, son, gerhart, and, in, 1894, their, son, wolfgang, elizabeth, would, marry, in, 1922, and, gerhart, in, 1923, wolfgang, however, became, a, casualty, of, the, first, world, war, gerhart, would, become, a, philosopher, of, law, contributing, to, the, subject, of, comparative, law, teaching, in, the, united, states, and, after, the, war, in, austria, following, his, marriage, husserl, began, his, long, teaching, career, in, philosophy, he, started, in, 1887, as, a, privatdozent, at, the, university, of, halle, in, 1891, he, published, his, philosophie, der, arithmetik, psychologische, und, logische, untersuchungen, which, drawing, on, his, prior, studies, in, mathematics, and, philosophy, proposed, a, psychological, context, as, the, basis, of, mathematics, it, drew, the, adverse, notice, of, gottlob, frege, who, criticized, its, psychologism, in, 1901, husserl, with, his, family, moved, to, the, university, of, g, ttingen, where, he, taught, as, extraordinarius, professor, just, prior, to, this, a, major, work, of, his, logische, untersuchungen, halle, 1900, 1901, was, published, volume, one, contains, seasoned, reflections, on, pure, logic, in, which, he, carefully, refutes, psychologism, this, work, was, well, received, and, became, the, subject, of, a, seminar, given, by, wilhelm, dilthey, husserl, in, 1905, traveled, to, berlin, to, visit, dilthey, two, years, later, in, italy, he, paid, a, visit, to, franz, brentano, his, inspiring, old, teacher, and, to, constantin, carath, odory, the, mathematician, kant, and, descartes, were, also, now, influencing, his, thought, in, 1910, he, became, joint, editor, of, the, journal, logos, during, this, period, husserl, had, delivered, lectures, on, internal, time, consciousness, which, several, decades, later, his, former, student, martin, heidegger, edited, for, publication, in, 1912, at, freiburg, the, journal, jahrbuch, f, r, philosophie, und, ph, nomenologische, forschung, yearbook, for, philosophy, and, phenomenological, research, was, founded, by, husserl, and, his, school, and, which, published, articles, of, their, phenomenological, movement, from, 1913, to, 1930, his, important, work, ideen, was, published, in, its, first, issue, vol, 1, issue, 1, 1913, before, beginning, ideen, husserl, s, thought, had, reached, the, stage, where, each, subject, is, presented, to, itself, and, to, each, all, others, are, presentiated, vergegenw, rtigung, not, as, parts, of, nature, but, as, pure, consciousness, ideen, advanced, his, transition, to, a, transcendental, interpretation, of, phenomenology, a, view, later, criticized, by, among, others, jean, paul, sartre, in, ideen, paul, ric, ur, sees, the, development, of, husserl, s, thought, as, leading, from, the, psychological, cogito, to, the, transcendental, cogito, as, phenomenology, further, evolves, it, leads, when, viewed, from, another, vantage, point, in, husserl, s, labyrinth, to, transcendental, subjectivity, also, in, ideen, husserl, explicitly, elaborates, the, phenomenological, and, eidetic, reductions, ivan, ilyin, and, karl, jaspers, visited, husserl, at, g, ttingen, in, october, 1914, both, his, sons, were, sent, to, fight, on, the, western, front, of, world, war, i, and, the, following, year, one, of, them, wolfgang, husserl, was, badly, injured, on, 8, march, 1916, on, the, battlefield, of, verdun, wolfgang, was, killed, in, action, the, next, year, his, other, son, gerhart, husserl, was, wounded, in, the, war, but, survived, his, own, mother, julia, died, in, november, 1917, one, of, his, outstanding, students, and, later, a, noted, philosophy, professor, in, his, own, right, adolf, reinach, was, killed, in, the, war, while, serving, in, flanders, husserl, had, transferred, in, 1916, to, the, university, of, freiburg, in, freiburg, im, breisgau, where, he, continued, bringing, his, work, in, philosophy, to, fruition, now, as, a, full, professor, edith, stein, served, as, his, personal, assistant, during, his, first, few, years, in, freiburg, followed, later, by, martin, heidegger, from, 1920, to, 1923, the, mathematician, hermann, weyl, began, corresponding, with, him, in, 1918, husserl, gave, four, lectures, on, phenomenological, method, at, university, college, london, in, 1922, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1923, called, on, him, to, relocate, there, but, he, declined, the, offer, in, 1926, heidegger, dedicated, his, book, sein, und, zeit, being, and, time, to, him, in, grateful, respect, and, friendship, husserl, remained, in, his, professorship, at, freiburg, until, he, requested, retirement, teaching, his, last, class, on, 25, july, 1928, a, festschrift, to, celebrate, his, seventieth, birthday, was, presented, to, him, on, 8, april, 1929, despite, retirement, husserl, gave, several, notable, lectures, the, first, at, paris, in, 1929, led, to, m, ditations, cart, siennes, paris, 1931, husserl, here, reviews, the, phenomenological, epoch, or, phenomenological, reduction, presented, earlier, in, his, pivotal, ideen, 1913, in, terms, of, a, further, reduction, of, experience, to, what, he, calls, a, sphere, of, ownness, from, within, this, sphere, which, husserl, enacts, to, show, the, impossibility, of, solipsism, the, transcendental, ego, finds, itself, always, already, paired, with, the, lived, body, of, another, ego, another, monad, this, a, priori, interconnection, of, bodies, given, in, perception, is, what, founds, the, interconnection, of, consciousnesses, known, as, transcendental, intersubjectivity, which, husserl, would, go, on, to, describe, at, length, in, volumes, of, unpublished, writings, there, has, been, a, debate, over, whether, or, not, husserl, s, description, of, ownness, and, its, movement, into, intersubjectivity, is, sufficient, to, reject, the, charge, of, solipsism, to, which, descartes, for, example, was, subject, one, argument, against, husserl, s, description, works, this, way, instead, of, infinity, and, the, deity, being, the, ego, s, gateway, to, the, other, as, in, descartes, husserl, s, ego, in, the, cartesian, meditations, itself, becomes, transcendent, it, remains, however, alone, unconnected, only, the, ego, s, grasp, by, analogy, of, the, other, e, g, by, conjectural, reciprocity, allows, the, possibility, for, an, objective, intersubjectivity, and, hence, for, community, in, 1933, the, racial, laws, of, the, new, national, socialist, german, workers, party, were, enacted, on, 6, april, husserl, was, banned, from, using, the, library, at, the, university, of, freiburg, or, any, other, academic, library, the, following, week, after, a, public, outcry, he, was, reinstated, yet, his, colleague, heidegger, was, elected, rector, of, the, university, on, 21, 22, april, and, joined, the, nazi, party, by, contrast, in, july, husserl, resigned, from, the, deutsche, akademie, later, husserl, lectured, at, prague, in, 1935, and, vienna, in, 1936, which, resulted, in, a, very, differently, styled, work, that, while, innovative, is, no, less, problematic, die, krisis, belgrade, 1936, husserl, describes, here, the, cultural, crisis, gripping, europe, then, approaches, a, philosophy, of, history, discussing, galileo, descartes, several, british, philosophers, and, kant, the, apolitical, husserl, before, had, specifically, avoided, such, historical, discussions, pointedly, preferring, to, go, directly, to, an, investigation, of, consciousness, merleau, ponty, and, others, question, whether, husserl, here, does, not, undercut, his, own, position, in, that, husserl, had, attacked, in, principle, historicism, while, specifically, designing, his, phenomenology, to, be, rigorous, enough, to, transcend, the, limits, of, history, on, the, contrary, husserl, may, be, indicating, here, that, historical, traditions, are, merely, features, given, to, the, pure, ego, s, intuition, like, any, other, a, longer, section, follows, on, the, lifeworld, one, not, observed, by, the, objective, logic, of, science, but, a, world, seen, through, subjective, experience, yet, a, problem, arises, similar, to, that, dealing, with, history, above, a, chicken, and, egg, problem, does, the, lifeworld, contextualize, and, thus, compromise, the, gaze, of, the, pure, ego, or, does, the, phenomenological, method, nonetheless, raise, the, ego, up, transcendent, these, last, writings, presented, the, fruits, of, his, professional, life, since, his, university, retirement, husserl, had, worked, at, a, tremendous, pace, producing, several, major, works, after, suffering, a, fall, in, the, autumn, of, 1937, the, philosopher, became, ill, with, pleurisy, edmund, husserl, died, in, freiburg, on, 27, april, 1938, having, just, turned, 79, his, wife, malvine, survived, him, eugen, fink, his, research, assistant, delivered, his, eulogy, gerhard, ritter, was, the, only, freiburg, faculty, member, to, attend, the, funeral, as, an, anti, nazi, protest, husserl, was, rumoured, to, have, been, denied, the, use, of, the, library, at, freiburg, as, a, result, of, the, anti, jewish, legislation, of, april, 1933, however, among, other, disabilities, husserl, was, unable, to, publish, his, works, in, nazi, germany, it, was, also, rumoured, that, his, former, pupil, martin, heidegger, informed, husserl, that, he, was, discharged, but, it, was, actually, the, previous, rector, apparently, husserl, and, heidegger, had, moved, apart, during, the, 1920s, which, became, clearer, after, 1928, when, husserl, retired, and, heidegger, succeeded, to, his, university, chair, in, the, summer, of, 1929, husserl, had, studied, carefully, selected, writings, of, heidegger, coming, to, the, conclusion, that, on, several, of, their, key, positions, they, differed, e, g, heidegger, substituted, dasein, for, the, pure, ego, thus, transforming, phenomenology, into, an, anthropology, a, type, of, psychologism, strongly, disfavored, by, husserl, such, observations, of, heidegger, along, with, a, critique, of, max, scheler, were, put, into, a, lecture, husserl, gave, to, various, kant, societies, in, frankfurt, berlin, and, halle, during, 1931, entitled, ph, nomenologie, und, anthropologie, in, the, war, time, 1941, edition, of, heidegger, s, primary, work, being, and, time, sein, und, zeit, first, published, in, 1927, the, original, dedication, to, husserl, was, removed, this, was, not, due, to, a, negation, of, the, relationship, between, the, two, philosophers, however, but, rather, was, the, result, of, a, suggested, censorship, by, heidegger, s, publisher, who, feared, that, the, book, might, otherwise, be, banned, by, the, nazi, regime, the, dedication, can, still, be, found, in, a, footnote, on, page, 38, thanking, husserl, for, his, guidance, and, generosity, husserl, had, died, three, years, earlier, in, post, war, editions, of, sein, und, zeit, the, dedication, to, husserl, is, restored, the, complex, troubled, and, sundered, philosophical, relationship, between, husserl, and, heidegger, has, been, widely, discussed, on, 4, may, 1933, professor, edmund, husserl, addressed, the, recent, regime, change, in, germany, and, its, consequences, the, future, alone, will, judge, which, was, the, true, germany, in, 1933, and, who, were, the, true, germans, those, who, subscribe, to, the, more, or, less, materialistic, mythical, racial, prejudices, of, the, day, or, those, germans, pure, in, heart, and, mind, heirs, to, the, great, germans, of, the, past, whose, tradition, they, revere, and, perpetuate, after, his, death, husserl, s, manuscripts, amounting, to, approximately, 40, 000, pages, of, gabelsberger, stenography, and, his, complete, research, library, were, in, 1939, smuggled, to, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, in, belgium, by, the, franciscan, priest, herman, van, breda, there, they, were, deposited, at, leuven, to, form, the, husserl, archives, of, the, higher, institute, of, philosophy, much, of, the, material, in, his, research, manuscripts, has, since, been, published, in, the, husserliana, critical, edition, series, in, his, first, works, husserl, combined, mathematics, psychology, and, philosophy, with, the, goal, of, providing, a, sound, foundation, for, mathematics, he, analyzed, the, psychological, process, needed, to, obtain, the, concept, of, number, and, then, built, up, a, theory, on, this, analysis, he, used, methods, and, concepts, taken, from, his, teachers, from, weierstrass, he, derived, the, idea, of, generating, the, concept, of, number, by, counting, a, certain, collection, of, objects, from, brentano, and, stumpf, he, took, the, distinction, between, proper, and, improper, presenting, 159, in, an, example, husserl, explained, this, in, the, following, way, if, someone, is, standing, in, front, of, a, house, they, have, a, proper, direct, presentation, of, that, house, but, if, they, are, looking, for, it, and, ask, for, directions, then, these, directions, e, g, the, house, on, the, corner, of, this, and, that, street, are, an, indirect, improper, presentation, in, other, words, the, person, can, have, a, proper, presentation, of, an, object, if, it, is, actually, present, and, an, improper, or, symbolic, as, husserl, also, calls, it, one, if, they, only, can, indicate, that, object, through, signs, symbols, etc, husserl, s, logical, investigations, 1900, 1901, is, considered, the, starting, point, for, the, formal, theory, of, wholes, and, their, parts, known, as, mereology, another, important, element, that, husserl, took, over, from, brentano, was, intentionality, the, notion, that, the, main, characteristic, of, consciousness, is, that, it, is, always, intentional, while, often, simplistically, summarised, as, aboutness, or, the, relationship, between, mental, acts, and, the, external, world, brentano, defined, it, as, the, main, characteristic, of, mental, phenomena, by, which, they, could, be, distinguished, from, physical, phenomena, every, mental, phenomenon, every, psychological, act, has, a, content, is, directed, at, an, object, the, intentional, object, every, belief, desire, etc, has, an, object, that, it, is, about, the, believed, the, wanted, brentano, used, the, expression, intentional, inexistence, to, indicate, the, status, of, the, objects, of, thought, in, the, mind, the, property, of, being, intentional, of, having, an, intentional, object, was, the, key, feature, to, distinguish, mental, phenomena, and, physical, phenomena, because, physical, phenomena, lack, intentionality, altogether, some, years, after, the, 1900, 1901, publication, of, his, main, work, the, logische, untersuchungen, logical, investigations, husserl, made, some, key, conceptual, elaborations, which, led, him, to, assert, that, to, study, the, structure, of, consciousness, one, would, have, to, distinguish, between, the, act, of, consciousness, and, the, phenomena, at, which, it, is, directed, the, objects, as, intended, knowledge, of, essences, would, only, be, possible, by, bracketing, all, assumptions, about, the, existence, of, an, external, world, this, procedure, he, called, epoch, these, new, concepts, prompted, the, publication, of, the, ideen, ideas, in, 1913, in, which, they, were, at, first, incorporated, and, a, plan, for, a, second, edition, of, the, logische, untersuchungen, from, the, ideen, onward, husserl, concentrated, on, the, ideal, essential, structures, of, consciousness, the, metaphysical, problem, of, establishing, the, reality, of, what, people, perceive, as, distinct, from, the, perceiving, subject, was, of, little, interest, to, husserl, in, spite, of, his, being, a, transcendental, idealist, husserl, proposed, that, the, world, of, objects, and, of, ways, in, which, people, direct, themselves, toward, and, perceive, those, objects, is, normally, conceived, of, in, what, he, called, the, natural, attitude, which, is, characterized, by, a, belief, that, objects, exist, distinct, from, the, perceiving, subject, and, exhibit, properties, that, people, see, as, emanating, from, them, this, attitude, is, also, called, physicalist, objectivism, husserl, proposed, a, radical, new, phenomenological, way, of, looking, at, objects, by, examining, how, people, in, their, many, ways, of, being, intentionally, directed, toward, them, actually, constitute, them, to, be, distinguished, from, materially, creating, objects, or, objects, merely, being, figments, of, the, imagination, in, the, phenomenological, standpoint, the, object, ceases, to, be, something, simply, external, and, ceases, to, be, seen, as, providing, indicators, about, what, it, is, and, becomes, a, grouping, of, perceptual, and, functional, aspects, that, imply, one, another, under, the, idea, of, a, particular, object, or, type, the, notion, of, objects, as, real, is, not, expelled, by, phenomenology, but, bracketed, as, a, way, in, which, people, regard, objects, instead, of, a, feature, that, inheres, in, an, object, s, essence, founded, in, the, relation, between, the, object, and, the, perceiver, to, better, understand, the, world, of, appearances, and, objects, phenomenology, attempts, to, identify, the, invariant, features, of, how, objects, are, perceived, and, pushes, attributions, of, reality, into, their, role, as, an, attribution, about, the, things, people, perceive, or, an, assumption, underlying, how, people, perceive, objects, the, major, dividing, line, in, husserl, s, thought, is, the, turn, to, transcendental, idealism, in, a, later, period, husserl, began, to, wrestle, with, the, complicated, issues, of, intersubjectivity, specifically, how, communication, about, an, object, can, be, assumed, to, refer, to, the, same, ideal, entity, cartesian, meditations, meditation, v, husserl, tries, new, methods, of, bringing, his, readers, to, understand, the, importance, of, phenomenology, to, scientific, inquiry, and, specifically, to, psychology, and, what, it, means, to, bracket, the, natural, attitude, the, crisis, of, the, european, sciences, is, husserl, s, unfinished, work, that, deals, most, directly, with, these, issues, in, it, husserl, for, the, first, time, attempts, a, historical, overview, of, the, development, of, western, philosophy, and, science, emphasizing, the, challenges, presented, by, their, increasingly, one, sidedly, empirical, and, naturalistic, orientation, husserl, declares, that, mental, and, spiritual, reality, possess, their, own, reality, independent, of, any, physical, basis, and, that, a, science, of, the, mind, geisteswissenschaft, must, be, established, on, as, scientific, a, foundation, as, the, natural, sciences, have, managed, it, is, my, conviction, that, intentional, phenomenology, has, for, the, first, time, made, spirit, as, spirit, the, field, of, systematic, scientific, experience, thus, effecting, a, total, transformation, of, the, task, of, knowledge, husserl, s, thought, is, revolutionary, in, several, ways, most, notably, in, the, distinction, between, natural, and, phenomenological, modes, of, understanding, in, the, former, sense, perception, in, correspondence, with, the, material, realm, constitutes, the, known, reality, and, understanding, is, premised, on, the, accuracy, of, the, perception, and, the, objective, knowability, of, what, is, called, the, real, world, phenomenological, understanding, strives, to, be, rigorously, presuppositionless, by, means, of, what, husserl, calls, phenomenological, reduction, this, reduction, is, not, conditioned, but, rather, transcendental, in, husserl, s, terms, pure, consciousness, of, absolute, being, in, husserl, s, work, consciousness, of, any, given, thing, calls, for, discerning, its, meaning, as, an, intentional, object, such, an, object, does, not, simply, strike, the, senses, to, be, interpreted, or, misinterpreted, by, mental, reason, it, has, already, been, selected, and, grasped, grasping, being, an, etymological, connotation, of, percipere, the, root, of, perceive, from, logical, investigations, 1900, 1901, to, experience, and, judgment, published, in, 1939, husserl, expressed, clearly, the, difference, between, meaning, and, object, he, identified, several, different, kinds, of, names, for, example, there, are, names, that, have, the, role, of, properties, that, uniquely, identify, an, object, each, of, these, names, expresses, a, meaning, and, designates, the, same, object, examples, of, this, are, the, victor, in, jena, and, the, loser, in, waterloo, or, the, equilateral, triangle, and, the, equiangular, triangle, in, both, cases, both, names, express, different, meanings, but, designate, the, same, object, there, are, names, which, have, no, meaning, but, have, the, role, of, designating, an, object, aristotle, socrates, and, so, on, finally, there, are, names, which, designate, a, variety, of, objects, these, are, called, universal, names, their, meaning, is, a, concept, and, refers, to, a, series, of, objects, the, extension, of, the, concept, the, way, people, know, sensible, objects, is, called, sensible, intuition, husserl, also, identifies, a, series, of, formal, words, which, are, necessary, to, form, sentences, and, have, no, sensible, correlates, examples, of, formal, words, are, a, the, more, than, over, under, two, group, and, so, on, every, sentence, must, contain, formal, words, to, designate, what, husserl, calls, formal, categories, there, are, two, kinds, of, categories, meaning, categories, and, formal, ontological, categories, meaning, categories, relate, judgments, they, include, forms, of, conjunction, disjunction, forms, of, plural, among, others, formal, ontological, categories, relate, objects, and, include, notions, such, as, set, cardinal, number, ordinal, number, part, and, whole, relation, and, so, on, the, way, people, know, these, categories, is, through, a, faculty, of, understanding, called, categorial, intuition, through, sensible, intuition, consciousness, constitutes, what, husserl, calls, a, situation, of, affairs, sachlage, it, is, a, passive, constitution, where, objects, themselves, are, presented, to, this, situation, of, affairs, through, categorial, intuition, people, are, able, to, constitute, a, state, of, affairs, sachverhalt, one, situation, of, affairs, through, objective, acts, of, consciousness, acts, of, constituting, categorially, can, serve, as, the, basis, for, constituting, multiple, states, of, affairs, for, example, suppose, a, and, b, are, two, sensible, objects, in, a, certain, situation, of, affairs, it, can, be, used, as, the, basis, to, say, a, b, and, b, a, two, judgments, which, designate, the, same, state, of, affairs, for, husserl, a, sentence, has, a, proposition, or, judgment, as, its, meaning, and, refers, to, a, state, of, affairs, which, has, a, situation, of, affairs, as, a, reference, base, 35, husserl, sees, ontology, as, a, science, of, essences, sciences, of, essences, are, contrasted, with, factual, sciences, the, former, are, knowable, a, priori, and, provide, the, foundation, for, the, later, which, are, knowable, a, posteriori, ontology, as, a, science, of, essences, is, not, interested, in, actual, facts, but, in, the, essences, themselves, whether, they, have, instances, or, not, husserl, distinguishes, between, formal, ontology, which, investigates, the, essence, of, objectivity, in, general, and, regional, ontologies, which, study, regional, essences, that, are, shared, by, all, entities, belonging, to, the, region, regions, correspond, to, the, highest, genera, of, concrete, entities, material, nature, personal, consciousness, and, interpersonal, spirit, husserl, s, method, for, studying, ontology, and, sciences, of, essence, in, general, is, called, eidetic, variation, it, involves, imagining, an, object, of, the, kind, under, investigation, and, varying, its, features, the, changed, feature, is, inessential, to, this, kind, if, the, object, can, survive, its, change, otherwise, it, belongs, to, the, kind, s, essence, for, example, a, triangle, remains, a, triangle, if, one, of, its, sides, is, extended, but, it, ceases, to, be, a, triangle, if, a, fourth, side, is, added, regional, ontology, involves, applying, this, method, to, the, essences, corresponding, to, the, highest, genera, husserl, believed, that, truth, in, itself, has, as, ontological, correlate, being, in, itself, just, as, meaning, categories, have, formal, ontological, categories, as, correlates, logic, is, a, formal, theory, of, judgment, that, studies, the, formal, a, priori, relations, among, judgments, using, meaning, categories, mathematics, on, the, other, hand, is, formal, ontology, it, studies, all, the, possible, forms, of, being, of, objects, hence, for, both, logic, and, mathematics, the, different, formal, categories, are, the, objects, of, study, not, the, sensible, objects, themselves, the, problem, with, the, psychological, approach, to, mathematics, and, logic, is, that, it, fails, to, account, for, the, fact, that, this, approach, is, about, formal, categories, and, not, simply, about, abstractions, from, sensibility, alone, the, reason, why, sensible, objects, are, not, dealt, with, in, mathematics, is, because, of, another, faculty, of, understanding, called, categorial, abstraction, through, this, faculty, people, are, able, to, get, rid, of, sensible, components, of, judgments, and, just, focus, on, formal, categories, themselves, thanks, to, eidetic, reduction, or, essential, intuition, people, are, able, to, grasp, the, possibility, impossibility, necessity, and, contingency, among, concepts, and, among, formal, categories, categorial, intuition, along, with, categorial, abstraction, and, eidetic, reduction, are, the, basis, for, logical, and, mathematical, knowledge, husserl, criticized, the, logicians, of, his, day, for, not, focusing, on, the, relation, between, subjective, processes, that, offer, objective, knowledge, of, pure, logic, all, subjective, activities, of, consciousness, need, an, ideal, correlate, and, objective, logic, constituted, noematically, as, it, is, constituted, by, consciousness, needs, a, noetic, correlate, the, subjective, activities, of, consciousness, husserl, stated, that, logic, has, three, strata, each, further, away, from, consciousness, and, psychology, than, those, that, precede, it, the, ontological, correlate, to, the, third, stratum, is, the, theory, of, manifolds, in, formal, ontology, it, is, a, free, investigation, where, a, mathematician, can, assign, several, meanings, to, several, symbols, and, all, their, possible, valid, deductions, in, a, general, and, indeterminate, manner, it, is, properly, speaking, the, most, universal, mathematics, of, all, through, the, posit, of, certain, indeterminate, objects, formal, ontological, categories, as, well, as, any, combination, of, mathematical, axioms, mathematicians, can, explore, the, apodeictic, connections, between, them, as, long, as, consistency, is, preserved, according, to, husserl, this, view, of, logic, and, mathematics, accounted, for, the, objectivity, of, a, series, of, mathematical, developments, of, his, time, such, as, n, dimensional, manifolds, both, euclidean, and, non, euclidean, hermann, grassmann, s, theory, of, extensions, william, rowan, hamilton, s, hamiltonians, sophus, lie, s, theory, of, transformation, groups, and, cantor, s, set, theory, jacob, klein, was, one, student, of, husserl, who, pursued, this, line, of, inquiry, seeking, to, desedimentize, mathematics, and, the, mathematical, sciences, after, obtaining, his, phd, in, mathematics, husserl, began, analyzing, the, foundations, of, mathematics, from, a, psychological, point, of, view, in, his, habilitation, thesis, on, the, concept, of, number, 1886, and, in, his, philosophy, of, arithmetic, 1891, husserl, sought, by, employing, brentano, s, descriptive, psychology, to, define, the, natural, numbers, in, a, way, that, advanced, the, methods, and, techniques, of, karl, weierstrass, richard, dedekind, georg, cantor, gottlob, frege, and, other, contemporary, mathematicians, later, in, the, first, volume, of, his, logical, investigations, the, prolegomena, of, pure, logic, husserl, while, attacking, the, psychologistic, point, of, view, in, logic, and, mathematics, also, appears, to, reject, much, of, his, early, work, although, the, forms, of, psychologism, analysed, and, refuted, in, the, prolegomena, did, not, apply, directly, to, his, philosophy, of, arithmetic, some, scholars, question, whether, frege, s, negative, review, of, the, philosophy, of, arithmetic, helped, turn, husserl, towards, modern, platonism, but, he, had, already, discovered, the, work, of, bernard, bolzano, independently, around, 1890, 91, in, his, logical, investigations, husserl, explicitly, mentioned, bolzano, g, w, leibniz, and, hermann, lotze, as, inspirations, for, his, newer, position, husserl, s, review, of, ernst, schr, der, published, before, frege, s, landmark, 1892, article, clearly, distinguishes, sense, from, reference, thus, husserl, s, notions, of, noema, and, object, also, arose, independently, likewise, in, his, criticism, of, frege, in, the, philosophy, of, arithmetic, husserl, remarks, on, the, distinction, between, the, content, and, the, extension, of, a, concept, moreover, the, distinction, between, the, subjective, mental, act, namely, the, content, of, a, concept, and, the, external, object, was, developed, independently, by, brentano, and, his, school, and, may, have, surfaced, as, early, as, brentano, s, 1870s, lectures, on, logic, scholars, such, as, j, n, mohanty, claire, ortiz, hill, and, guillermo, e, rosado, haddock, among, others, have, argued, that, husserl, s, so, called, change, from, psychologism, to, platonism, came, about, independently, of, frege, s, review, 253, 262, for, example, the, review, falsely, accuses, husserl, of, subjectivizing, everything, so, that, no, objectivity, is, possible, and, falsely, attributes, to, him, a, notion, of, abstraction, whereby, objects, disappear, until, all, that, remains, are, numbers, as, mere, ghosts, contrary, to, what, frege, states, in, husserl, s, philosophy, of, arithmetic, there, are, already, two, different, kinds, of, representations, subjective, and, objective, moreover, objectivity, is, clearly, defined, in, that, work, frege, s, attack, seems, to, be, directed, at, certain, foundational, doctrines, then, current, in, weierstrass, s, berlin, school, of, which, husserl, and, cantor, cannot, be, said, to, be, orthodox, representatives, furthermore, various, sources, indicate, that, husserl, changed, his, mind, about, psychologism, as, early, as, 1890, a, year, before, he, published, the, philosophy, of, arithmetic, husserl, stated, that, by, the, time, he, published, that, book, he, had, already, changed, his, mind, that, he, had, doubts, about, psychologism, from, the, very, outset, he, attributed, this, change, of, mind, to, his, reading, of, leibniz, bolzano, lotze, and, david, hume, husserl, makes, no, mention, of, frege, as, a, decisive, factor, in, this, change, in, his, logical, investigations, husserl, mentions, frege, only, twice, once, in, a, footnote, to, point, out, that, he, had, retracted, three, pages, of, his, criticism, of, frege, s, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, and, again, to, question, frege, s, use, of, the, word, bedeutung, to, designate, reference, rather, than, meaning, sense, in, a, letter, dated, 24, may, 1891, frege, thanked, husserl, for, sending, him, a, copy, of, the, philosophy, of, arithmetic, and, husserl, s, review, of, ernst, schr, der, s, vorlesungen, ber, die, algebra, der, logik, in, the, same, letter, frege, used, the, review, of, schr, der, s, book, to, analyze, husserl, s, notion, of, the, sense, of, reference, of, concept, words, hence, frege, recognized, as, early, as, 1891, that, husserl, distinguished, between, sense, and, reference, consequently, frege, and, husserl, independently, elaborated, a, theory, of, sense, and, reference, before, 1891, commentators, argue, that, husserl, s, notion, of, noema, has, nothing, to, do, with, frege, s, notion, of, sense, because, noemata, are, necessarily, fused, with, noeses, which, are, the, conscious, activities, of, consciousness, noemata, have, three, different, levels, consequently, in, intentional, activities, even, non, existent, objects, can, be, constituted, and, form, part, of, the, whole, noema, frege, however, did, not, conceive, of, objects, as, forming, parts, of, senses, if, a, proper, name, denotes, a, non, existent, object, it, does, not, have, a, reference, hence, concepts, with, no, objects, have, no, truth, value, in, arguments, moreover, husserl, did, not, maintain, that, predicates, of, sentences, designate, concepts, according, to, frege, the, reference, of, a, sentence, is, a, truth, value, for, husserl, it, is, a, state, of, affairs, frege, s, notion, of, sense, is, unrelated, to, husserl, s, noema, while, the, latter, s, notions, of, meaning, and, object, differ, from, those, of, frege, in, detail, husserl, s, conception, of, logic, and, mathematics, differs, from, that, of, frege, who, held, that, arithmetic, could, be, derived, from, logic, for, husserl, this, is, not, the, case, mathematics, with, the, exception, of, geometry, is, the, ontological, correlate, of, logic, and, while, both, fields, are, related, neither, one, is, strictly, reducible, to, the, other, reacting, against, authors, such, as, john, stuart, mill, christoph, von, sigwart, and, his, own, former, teacher, brentano, husserl, criticised, their, psychologism, in, mathematics, and, logic, i, e, their, conception, of, these, abstract, and, a, priori, sciences, as, having, an, essentially, empirical, foundation, and, a, prescriptive, or, descriptive, nature, according, to, psychologism, logic, would, not, be, an, autonomous, discipline, but, a, branch, of, psychology, either, proposing, a, prescriptive, and, practical, art, of, correct, judgement, as, brentano, and, some, of, his, more, orthodox, students, did, or, a, description, of, the, factual, processes, of, human, thought, husserl, pointed, out, that, the, failure, of, anti, psychologists, to, defeat, psychologism, was, a, result, of, being, unable, to, distinguish, between, the, foundational, theoretical, side, of, logic, and, the, applied, practical, side, pure, logic, does, not, deal, at, all, with, thoughts, or, judgings, as, mental, episodes, but, about, a, priori, laws, and, conditions, for, any, theory, and, any, judgments, whatsoever, conceived, as, propositions, in, themselves, since, truth, in, itself, has, being, in, itself, as, ontological, correlate, and, since, psychologists, reduce, truth, and, hence, logic, to, empirical, psychology, the, inevitable, consequence, is, scepticism, psychologists, have, not, been, successful, either, in, showing, how, induction, or, psychological, processes, can, justify, the, absolute, certainty, of, logical, principles, such, as, the, principles, of, identity, and, non, contradiction, it, is, therefore, futile, to, base, certain, logical, laws, and, principles, on, uncertain, processes, of, the, mind, this, confusion, made, by, psychologism, and, related, disciplines, such, as, biologism, and, anthropologism, can, be, due, to, three, specific, prejudices, 1, the, first, prejudice, is, the, supposition, that, logic, is, somehow, normative, in, nature, husserl, argues, that, logic, is, theoretical, i, e, that, logic, itself, proposes, a, priori, laws, which, are, themselves, the, basis, of, the, normative, side, of, logic, since, mathematics, is, related, to, logic, he, cites, an, example, from, mathematics, a, formula, like, a, b, a, b, a, b, does, not, offer, any, insight, into, how, to, think, mathematically, it, just, expresses, a, truth, a, proposition, that, says, the, product, of, the, sum, and, the, difference, of, a, and, b, should, give, the, difference, of, the, squares, of, a, and, b, does, express, a, normative, proposition, but, this, normative, statement, is, based, on, the, theoretical, statement, a, b, a, b, a, b, 2, for, psychologists, the, acts, of, judging, reasoning, deriving, and, so, on, are, all, psychological, processes, therefore, it, is, the, role, of, psychology, to, provide, the, foundation, of, these, processes, husserl, states, that, this, effort, made, by, psychologists, is, a, met, basis, eis, llo, g, nos, gr, a, transgression, to, another, field, 344, it, is, a, met, basis, because, psychology, cannot, provide, any, foundations, for, a, priori, laws, which, themselves, are, the, basis, for, all, correct, thought, psychologists, have, the, problem, of, confusing, intentional, activities, with, the, object, of, these, activities, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, the, act, of, judging, and, the, judgment, itself, the, act, of, counting, and, the, number, itself, and, so, on, counting, five, objects, is, undeniably, a, psychological, process, but, the, number, 5, is, not, 3, judgments, can, be, true, or, not, true, psychologists, argue, that, judgments, are, true, because, they, become, evidently, true, to, us, 261, this, evidence, a, psychological, process, that, guarantees, truth, is, indeed, a, psychological, process, husserl, responds, by, saying, that, truth, itself, as, well, as, logical, laws, always, remain, valid, regardless, of, psychological, evidence, that, they, are, true, no, psychological, process, can, explain, the, a, priori, objectivity, of, these, logical, truths, from, this, criticism, to, psychologism, the, distinction, between, psychological, acts, and, their, intentional, objects, and, the, difference, between, the, normative, side, of, logic, and, the, theoretical, side, derives, from, a, platonist, conception, of, logic, this, means, that, logical, and, mathematical, laws, should, be, regarded, as, being, independent, of, the, human, mind, and, also, as, an, autonomy, of, meanings, it, is, essentially, the, difference, between, the, real, everything, subject, to, time, and, the, ideal, or, irreal, everything, that, is, atemporal, such, as, logical, truths, mathematical, entities, mathematical, truths, and, meanings, in, general, david, carr, commented, on, husserl, s, following, in, his, 1970, dissertation, at, yale, it, is, well, known, that, husserl, was, always, disappointed, at, the, tendency, of, his, students, to, go, their, own, way, to, embark, upon, fundamental, revisions, of, phenomenology, rather, than, engage, in, the, communal, task, as, originally, intended, by, the, radical, new, science, notwithstanding, he, did, attract, philosophers, to, phenomenology, martin, heidegger, is, the, best, known, of, husserl, s, students, the, one, whom, husserl, chose, as, his, successor, at, freiburg, heidegger, s, magnum, opus, being, and, time, was, dedicated, to, husserl, they, shared, their, thoughts, and, worked, alongside, each, other, for, over, a, decade, at, the, university, of, freiburg, heidegger, being, husserl, s, assistant, during, 1920, 1923, heidegger, s, early, work, followed, his, teacher, but, with, time, he, began, to, develop, new, insights, distinctively, variant, husserl, became, increasingly, critical, of, heidegger, s, work, especially, in, 1929, and, included, pointed, criticism, of, heidegger, in, lectures, he, gave, during, 1931, heidegger, while, acknowledging, his, debt, to, husserl, followed, a, political, position, offensive, and, harmful, to, husserl, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, 1933, husserl, being, of, jewish, origin, and, heidegger, infamously, being, then, a, nazi, proponent, academic, discussion, of, husserl, and, heidegger, is, extensive, at, g, ttingen, in, 1913, adolf, reinach, 1884, 1917, was, now, husserl, s, right, hand, he, was, above, all, the, mediator, between, husserl, and, the, students, for, he, understood, extremely, well, how, to, deal, with, other, persons, whereas, husserl, was, pretty, much, helpless, in, this, respect, he, was, an, original, editor, of, husserl, s, new, journal, jahrbuch, one, of, his, works, giving, a, phenomenological, analysis, of, the, law, of, obligations, appeared, in, its, first, issue, reinach, was, widely, admired, and, a, remarkable, teacher, husserl, in, his, 1917, obituary, wrote, he, wanted, to, draw, only, from, the, deepest, sources, he, wanted, to, produce, only, work, of, enduring, value, and, through, his, wise, restraint, he, succeeded, in, this, edith, stein, was, husserl, s, student, at, g, ttingen, and, freiburg, while, she, wrote, her, doctoral, thesis, the, empathy, problem, as, it, developed, historically, and, considered, phenomenologically, 1916, she, then, became, his, assistant, at, freiburg, in, 1916, 18, she, later, adapted, her, phenomenology, to, the, modern, school, of, modern, thomism, ludwig, landgrebe, became, assistant, to, husserl, in, 1923, from, 1939, he, collaborated, with, eugen, fink, at, the, husserl, archives, in, leuven, in, 1954, he, became, leader, of, the, husserl, archives, landgrebe, is, known, as, one, of, husserl, s, closest, associates, but, also, for, his, independent, views, relating, to, history, religion, and, politics, as, seen, from, the, viewpoints, of, existentialist, philosophy, and, metaphysics, eugen, fink, was, a, close, associate, of, husserl, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, he, wrote, the, sixth, cartesian, meditation, which, husserl, said, was, the, truest, expression, and, continuation, of, his, own, work, fink, delivered, the, eulogy, for, husserl, in, 1938, roman, ingarden, an, early, student, of, husserl, at, freiburg, corresponded, with, husserl, into, the, mid, 1930s, ingarden, did, not, accept, however, the, later, transcendental, idealism, of, husserl, which, he, thought, would, lead, to, relativism, ingarden, has, written, his, work, in, german, and, polish, in, his, sp, r, o, istnienie, wiata, ger, der, streit, um, die, existenz, der, welt, eng, dispute, about, existence, of, the, world, he, created, his, own, realistic, position, which, also, helped, to, spread, phenomenology, in, poland, max, scheler, met, husserl, in, halle, in, 1901, and, found, in, his, phenomenology, a, methodological, breakthrough, for, his, own, philosophy, scheler, who, was, at, g, ttingen, when, husserl, taught, there, was, one, of, the, original, few, editors, of, the, journal, jahrbuch, f, r, philosophie, und, ph, nomenologische, forschung, 1913, scheler, s, work, formalism, in, ethics, and, nonformal, ethics, of, value, appeared, in, the, new, journal, 1913, and, 1916, and, drew, acclaim, the, personal, relationship, between, the, two, men, however, became, strained, due, to, scheler, s, legal, troubles, and, scheler, returned, to, munich, although, scheler, later, criticised, husserl, s, idealistic, logical, approach, and, proposed, instead, a, phenomenology, of, love, he, states, that, he, remained, deeply, indebted, to, husserl, throughout, his, work, nicolai, hartmann, was, once, thought, to, be, at, the, center, of, phenomenology, but, perhaps, no, longer, in, 1921, the, prestige, of, hartmann, the, neo, kantian, who, was, professor, of, philosophy, at, marburg, was, added, to, the, movement, he, publicly, declared, his, solidarity, with, the, actual, work, of, die, ph, nomenologie, yet, hartmann, s, connections, were, with, max, scheler, and, the, munich, circle, husserl, himself, evidently, did, not, consider, him, as, a, phenomenologist, his, philosophy, however, is, said, to, include, an, innovative, use, of, the, method, emmanuel, levinas, in, 1929, gave, a, presentation, at, one, of, husserl, s, last, seminars, in, freiburg, also, that, year, he, wrote, on, husserl, s, ideen, 1913, a, long, review, published, by, a, french, journal, with, gabrielle, peiffer, levinas, translated, into, french, husserl, s, m, ditations, cart, siennes, 1931, he, was, at, first, impressed, with, heidegger, and, began, a, book, on, him, but, broke, off, the, project, when, heidegger, became, involved, with, the, nazis, after, the, war, he, wrote, on, jewish, spirituality, most, of, his, family, had, been, murdered, by, the, nazis, in, lithuania, levinas, then, began, to, write, works, that, would, become, widely, known, and, admired, alfred, schutz, s, phenomenology, of, the, social, world, seeks, to, rigorously, ground, max, weber, s, interpretive, sociology, in, husserl, s, phenomenology, husserl, was, impressed, by, this, work, and, asked, schutz, to, be, his, assistant, jean, paul, sartre, was, also, largely, influenced, by, husserl, although, he, later, came, to, disagree, with, key, points, in, his, analyses, sartre, rejected, husserl, s, transcendental, interpretations, begun, in, his, ideen, 1913, and, instead, followed, heidegger, s, ontology, maurice, merleau, ponty, s, phenomenology, of, perception, is, influenced, by, edmund, husserl, s, work, on, perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space, and, temporality, including, husserl, s, theory, of, retention, and, protention, merleau, ponty, s, description, of, motor, intentionality, and, sexuality, for, example, retain, the, important,
