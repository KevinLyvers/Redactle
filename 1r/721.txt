in, the, roman, province, of, numidia, his, mother, monica, or, monnica, was, a, devout, christian, his, father, patricius, was, a, pagan, who, converted, to, christianity, on, his, deathbed, he, had, a, brother, named, navigius, and, a, sister, whose, name, is, lost, but, is, conventionally, remembered, as, perpetua, scholars, generally, agree, that, augustine, and, his, family, were, berbers, an, ethnic, group, indigenous, to, north, africa, but, were, heavily, romanized, speaking, only, latin, at, home, as, a, matter, of, pride, and, dignity, in, his, writings, augustine, leaves, some, information, as, to, the, consciousness, of, his, african, heritage, at, least, geographically, and, perhaps, ethnically, for, example, he, refers, to, apuleius, as, the, most, notorious, of, us, africans, to, ponticianus, as, a, country, man, of, ours, insofar, as, being, african, and, to, faustus, of, mileve, as, an, african, gentleman, augustine, s, family, name, aurelius, suggests, his, father, s, ancestors, were, freedmen, of, the, gens, aurelia, given, full, roman, citizenship, by, the, edict, of, caracalla, in, 212, augustine, s, family, had, been, roman, from, a, legal, standpoint, for, at, least, a, century, when, he, was, born, it, is, assumed, that, his, mother, monica, was, of, berber, origin, on, the, basis, of, her, name, but, as, his, family, were, honestiores, an, upper, class, of, citizens, known, as, honorable, men, augustine, s, first, language, was, likely, latin, at, the, age, of, 11, augustine, was, sent, to, school, at, madaurus, now, m, daourouch, a, small, numidian, city, about, 31, kilometres, 19, miles, south, of, thagaste, there, he, became, familiar, with, latin, literature, as, well, as, pagan, beliefs, and, practices, his, first, insight, into, the, nature, of, sin, occurred, when, he, and, a, number, of, friends, stole, pears, from, a, neighbourhood, garden, he, tells, this, story, in, his, autobiography, confessions, he, realises, that, the, pears, were, tempting, neither, for, its, colour, nor, its, flavour, he, was, neither, hungry, nor, poor, and, he, had, enough, of, fruit, which, were, much, better, over, the, next, few, chapters, augustine, agonises, over, this, past, sin, of, his, recognising, that, one, does, not, desire, evil, for, evil, s, sake, rather, through, an, inordinate, preference, for, these, goods, of, a, lower, kind, the, better, and, higher, are, neglected, in, other, words, man, is, drawn, to, sin, when, grossly, choosing, the, lesser, good, over, a, greater, good, eventually, augustine, concludes, that, it, was, the, good, of, the, companionship, between, him, and, his, accomplices, that, allowed, him, to, delight, in, this, theft, at, the, age, of, 17, through, the, generosity, of, his, fellow, citizen, romanianus, augustine, went, to, carthage, to, continue, his, education, in, rhetoric, though, it, was, above, the, financial, means, of, his, family, despite, the, good, warnings, of, his, mother, as, a, youth, augustine, lived, a, hedonistic, lifestyle, for, a, time, associating, with, young, men, who, boasted, of, their, sexual, exploits, the, need, to, gain, their, acceptance, encouraged, inexperienced, boys, like, augustine, to, seek, or, make, up, stories, about, sexual, experiences, despite, multiple, claims, to, the, contrary, it, has, been, suggested, that, augustine, s, actual, sexual, experiences, were, likely, with, members, of, the, opposite, sex, only, it, was, while, he, was, a, student, in, carthage, that, he, read, cicero, s, dialogue, hortensius, now, lost, which, he, described, as, leaving, a, lasting, impression, enkindling, in, his, heart, the, love, of, wisdom, and, a, great, thirst, for, truth, it, started, his, interest, in, philosophy, although, raised, christian, augustine, became, a, manichaean, much, to, his, mother, s, chagrin, at, about, the, age, of, 17, augustine, began, a, relationship, with, a, young, woman, in, carthage, though, his, mother, wanted, him, to, marry, a, person, of, his, class, the, woman, remained, his, lover, he, was, warned, by, his, mother, to, avoid, fornication, sex, outside, marriage, but, augustine, persisted, in, the, relationship, for, over, fifteen, years, and, the, woman, gave, birth, to, his, son, adeodatus, 372, 388, which, means, gift, from, god, who, was, viewed, as, extremely, intelligent, by, his, contemporaries, in, 385, augustine, ended, his, relationship, with, his, lover, in, order, to, prepare, to, marry, a, teenage, heiress, by, the, time, he, was, able, to, marry, her, however, he, had, decided, to, become, a, christian, priest, and, the, marriage, did, not, happen, augustine, was, from, the, beginning, a, brilliant, student, with, an, eager, intellectual, curiosity, but, he, never, mastered, greek, his, first, greek, teacher, was, a, brutal, man, who, constantly, beat, his, students, and, augustine, rebelled, and, refused, to, study, by, the, time, he, realized, he, needed, to, know, greek, it, was, too, late, and, although, he, acquired, a, smattering, of, the, language, he, was, never, eloquent, with, it, he, did, however, become, a, master, of, latin, augustine, taught, grammar, at, thagaste, during, 373, and, 374, the, following, year, he, moved, to, carthage, to, conduct, a, school, of, rhetoric, and, remained, there, for, the, next, nine, years, disturbed, by, unruly, students, in, carthage, he, moved, to, establish, a, school, in, rome, where, he, believed, the, best, and, brightest, rhetoricians, practised, in, 383, however, augustine, was, disappointed, with, the, apathetic, reception, it, was, the, custom, for, students, to, pay, their, fees, to, the, professor, on, the, last, day, of, the, term, and, many, students, attended, faithfully, all, term, and, then, did, not, pay, manichaean, friends, introduced, him, to, the, prefect, of, the, city, of, rome, symmachus, who, had, been, asked, by, the, imperial, court, at, milan, to, provide, a, rhetoric, professor, augustine, won, the, job, and, headed, north, to, take, his, position, in, milan, in, late, 384, thirty, years, old, he, had, won, the, most, visible, academic, position, in, the, latin, world, at, a, time, when, such, posts, gave, ready, access, to, political, careers, although, augustine, spent, ten, years, as, a, manichaean, he, was, never, an, initiate, or, elect, but, an, auditor, the, lowest, level, in, this, religion, s, hierarchy, while, still, at, carthage, a, disappointing, meeting, with, the, manichaean, bishop, faustus, of, mileve, a, key, exponent, of, manichaean, theology, started, augustine, s, scepticism, of, manichaeanism, in, rome, he, reportedly, turned, away, from, manichaeanism, embracing, the, scepticism, of, the, new, academy, movement, because, of, his, education, augustine, had, great, rhetorical, prowess, and, was, very, knowledgeable, of, the, philosophies, behind, many, faiths, at, milan, his, mother, s, religiosity, augustine, s, own, studies, in, neoplatonism, and, his, friend, simplicianus, all, urged, him, towards, christianity, this, was, shortly, after, the, roman, emperor, theodosius, i, declared, christianity, to, be, the, only, legitimate, religion, for, the, roman, empire, on, 27, february, 380, by, the, edict, of, thessalonica, and, then, issued, a, decree, of, death, for, all, manichaean, monks, in, 382, initially, augustine, was, not, strongly, influenced, by, christianity, and, its, ideologies, but, after, coming, in, contact, with, ambrose, of, milan, augustine, reevaluated, himself, and, was, forever, changed, augustine, arrived, in, milan, and, visited, ambrose, having, heard, of, his, reputation, as, an, orator, like, augustine, ambrose, was, a, master, of, rhetoric, but, older, and, more, experienced, soon, their, relationship, grew, as, augustine, wrote, and, i, began, to, love, him, of, course, not, at, the, first, as, a, teacher, of, the, truth, for, i, had, entirely, despaired, of, finding, that, in, thy, church, but, as, a, friendly, man, augustine, was, very, much, influenced, by, ambrose, even, more, than, by, his, own, mother, and, others, he, admired, in, his, confessions, augustine, states, that, man, of, god, received, me, as, a, father, would, and, welcomed, my, coming, as, a, good, bishop, should, ambrose, adopted, augustine, as, a, spiritual, son, after, the, death, of, augustine, s, father, augustine, s, mother, had, followed, him, to, milan, and, arranged, a, respectable, marriage, for, him, although, augustine, acquiesced, he, had, to, dismiss, his, concubine, and, grieved, for, having, forsaken, his, lover, he, wrote, my, mistress, being, torn, from, my, side, as, an, impediment, to, my, marriage, my, heart, which, clave, to, her, was, racked, and, wounded, and, bleeding, augustine, confessed, he, had, not, been, a, lover, of, wedlock, so, much, as, a, slave, of, lust, so, he, procured, another, concubine, since, he, had, to, wait, two, years, until, his, fianc, e, came, of, age, however, his, emotional, wound, was, not, healed, it, was, during, this, period, that, he, uttered, his, famously, insincere, prayer, grant, me, chastity, and, continence, but, not, yet, there, is, evidence, augustine, may, have, considered, this, former, relationship, to, be, equivalent, to, marriage, in, his, confessions, he, admitted, the, experience, eventually, produced, a, decreased, sensitivity, to, pain, augustine, eventually, broke, off, his, engagement, to, his, eleven, year, old, fianc, e, but, never, renewed, his, relationship, with, either, of, his, concubines, alypius, of, thagaste, steered, augustine, away, from, marriage, saying, they, could, not, live, a, life, together, in, the, love, of, wisdom, if, he, married, augustine, looked, back, years, later, on, the, life, at, cassiciacum, a, villa, outside, of, milan, where, he, gathered, with, his, followers, and, described, it, as, christianae, vitae, otium, the, leisure, of, christian, life, in, late, august, of, 386, at, the, age, of, 31, having, heard, of, ponticianus, s, and, his, friends, first, reading, of, the, life, of, anthony, of, the, desert, augustine, converted, to, christianity, as, augustine, later, told, it, his, conversion, was, prompted, by, hearing, a, child, s, voice, say, take, up, and, read, latin, tolle, lege, resorting, to, the, sortes, biblicae, he, opened, a, book, of, st, paul, s, writings, codex, apostoli, 8, 12, 29, at, random, and, read, romans, 13, 13, 14, not, in, rioting, and, drunkenness, not, in, chambering, and, wantonness, not, in, strife, and, envying, but, put, on, the, lord, jesus, christ, and, make, no, provision, for, the, flesh, to, fulfil, the, lusts, thereof, he, later, wrote, an, account, of, his, conversion, in, his, confessions, latin, confessiones, which, has, since, become, a, classic, of, christian, theology, and, a, key, text, in, the, history, of, autobiography, this, work, is, an, outpouring, of, thanksgiving, and, penitence, although, it, is, written, as, an, account, of, his, life, the, confessions, also, talks, about, the, nature, of, time, causality, free, will, and, other, important, philosophical, topics, the, following, is, taken, from, that, work, belatedly, i, loved, thee, o, beauty, so, ancient, and, so, new, belatedly, i, loved, thee, for, see, thou, wast, within, and, i, was, without, and, i, sought, thee, out, there, unlovely, i, rushed, heedlessly, among, the, lovely, things, thou, hast, made, thou, wast, with, me, but, i, was, not, with, thee, these, things, kept, me, far, from, thee, even, though, they, were, not, at, all, unless, they, were, in, thee, thou, didst, call, and, cry, aloud, and, didst, force, open, my, deafness, thou, didst, gleam, and, shine, and, didst, chase, away, my, blindness, thou, didst, breathe, fragrant, odours, and, i, drew, in, my, breath, and, now, i, pant, for, thee, i, tasted, and, now, i, hunger, and, thirst, thou, didst, touch, me, and, i, burned, for, thy, peace, ambrose, baptized, augustine, and, his, son, adeodatus, in, milan, on, easter, vigil, 24, 25, april, 387, a, year, later, in, 388, augustine, completed, his, apology, on, the, holiness, of, the, catholic, church, that, year, also, adeodatus, and, augustine, returned, home, to, africa, augustine, s, mother, monica, died, at, ostia, italy, as, they, prepared, to, embark, for, africa, upon, their, arrival, they, began, a, life, of, aristocratic, leisure, at, augustine, s, family, s, property, soon, after, adeodatus, too, died, augustine, then, sold, his, patrimony, and, gave, the, money, to, the, poor, he, only, kept, the, family, house, which, he, converted, into, a, monastic, foundation, for, himself, and, a, group, of, friends, furthermore, while, he, was, known, for, his, major, contributions, to, christian, rhetoric, another, major, contribution, was, his, preaching, style, after, converting, to, christianity, augustine, turned, against, his, profession, as, a, rhetoric, professor, in, order, to, devote, more, time, to, preaching, in, 391, augustine, was, ordained, a, priest, in, hippo, regius, now, annaba, in, algeria, he, was, especially, interested, in, discovering, how, his, previous, rhetorical, training, in, italian, schools, would, help, the, christian, church, achieve, its, objective, of, discovering, and, teaching, the, different, scriptures, in, the, bible, he, became, a, famous, preacher, more, than, 350, preserved, sermons, are, believed, to, be, authentic, and, was, noted, for, combating, the, manichaean, religion, to, which, he, had, formerly, adhered, he, preached, around, 6, 000, to, 10, 000, sermons, when, he, was, alive, however, there, are, only, around, 500, sermons, that, are, accessible, today, when, augustine, preached, his, sermons, they, were, recorded, by, stenographers, some, of, his, sermons, would, last, over, one, hour, and, he, would, preach, multiple, times, throughout, a, given, week, when, talking, to, his, audience, he, would, stand, on, an, elevated, platform, however, he, would, walk, towards, the, audience, during, his, sermons, when, he, was, preaching, he, used, a, variety, of, rhetorical, devices, that, included, analogies, word, pictures, similes, metaphors, repetition, and, antithesis, when, trying, to, explain, more, about, the, bible, in, addition, he, used, questions, and, rhymes, when, talking, about, the, differences, between, people, s, life, on, earth, and, heaven, as, seen, in, one, of, his, sermons, that, was, preached, in, 412, ad, augustine, believed, that, the, preachers, ultimate, goal, is, to, ensure, the, salvation, of, their, audience, in, 395, he, was, made, coadjutor, bishop, of, hippo, and, became, full, bishop, shortly, thereafter, hence, the, name, augustine, of, hippo, and, he, gave, his, property, to, the, church, of, thagaste, he, remained, in, that, position, until, his, death, in, 430, bishops, were, the, only, individuals, allowed, to, preach, when, he, was, alive, and, he, scheduled, time, to, preach, after, being, ordained, despite, a, busy, schedule, made, up, of, preparing, sermons, and, preaching, at, other, churches, besides, his, own, when, serving, as, the, bishop, of, hippo, his, goal, was, to, minister, to, individuals, in, his, congregation, and, he, would, choose, the, passages, that, the, church, planned, to, read, every, week, as, bishop, he, believed, that, it, was, his, job, to, interpret, the, work, of, the, bible, he, wrote, his, autobiographical, confessions, in, 397, 398, his, work, the, city, of, god, was, written, to, console, his, fellow, christians, shortly, after, the, visigoths, had, sacked, rome, in, 410, augustine, worked, tirelessly, to, convince, the, people, of, hippo, to, convert, to, christianity, though, he, had, left, his, monastery, he, continued, to, lead, a, monastic, life, in, the, episcopal, residence, much, of, augustine, s, later, life, was, recorded, by, his, friend, possidius, bishop, of, calama, present, day, guelma, algeria, in, his, sancti, augustini, vita, during, this, latter, part, of, augustine, s, life, he, helped, lead, a, large, community, of, christians, against, different, political, and, religious, factors, which, had, a, major, influence, on, his, writings, possidius, admired, augustine, as, a, man, of, powerful, intellect, and, a, stirring, orator, who, took, every, opportunity, to, defend, christianity, against, its, detractors, possidius, also, described, augustine, s, personal, traits, in, detail, drawing, a, portrait, of, a, man, who, ate, sparingly, worked, tirelessly, despised, gossip, shunned, the, temptations, of, the, flesh, and, exercised, prudence, in, the, financial, stewardship, of, his, see, shortly, before, augustine, s, death, the, vandals, a, germanic, tribe, that, had, converted, to, arianism, invaded, roman, africa, the, vandals, besieged, hippo, in, the, spring, of, 430, when, augustine, entered, his, final, illness, according, to, possidius, one, of, the, few, miracles, attributed, to, augustine, the, healing, of, an, ill, man, took, place, during, the, siege, augustine, has, been, cited, to, have, excommunicated, himself, upon, the, approach, of, his, death, in, an, act, of, public, penance, and, solidarity, with, sinners, spending, his, final, days, in, prayer, and, repentance, he, requested, the, penitential, psalms, of, david, be, hung, on, his, walls, so, he, could, read, them, and, upon, which, led, him, to, freely, and, constantly, according, to, posiddius, biography, he, directed, the, library, of, the, church, in, hippo, and, all, the, books, therein, should, be, carefully, preserved, he, died, on, 28, august, 430, shortly, after, his, death, the, vandals, lifted, the, siege, of, hippo, but, they, returned, soon, after, and, burned, the, city, they, destroyed, all, but, augustine, s, cathedral, and, library, which, they, left, untouched, augustine, was, canonized, by, popular, acclaim, and,

contribution, of, writings, covered, diverse, fields, including, theology, philosophy, and, sociology, along, with, john, chrysostom, augustine, was, among, the, most, prolific, scholars, of, the, early, church, by, quantity, augustine, was, one, of, the, first, christian, ancient, latin, authors, with, a, very, clear, vision, of, theological, anthropology, he, saw, the, human, being, as, a, perfect, unity, of, soul, and, body, in, his, late, treatise, on, care, to, be, had, for, the, dead, section, 5, 420, he, exhorted, respect, for, the, body, on, the, grounds, it, belonged, to, the, very, nature, of, the, human, person, augustine, s, favourite, figure, to, describe, body, soul, unity, is, marriage, caro, tua, coniunx, tua, your, body, is, your, wife, initially, the, two, elements, were, in, perfect, harmony, after, the, fall, of, humanity, they, are, now, experiencing, dramatic, combat, with, one, another, they, are, two, categorically, different, things, the, body, is, a, three, dimensional, object, composed, of, the, four, elements, whereas, the, soul, has, no, spatial, dimensions, soul, is, a, kind, of, substance, participating, in, reason, fit, for, ruling, the, body, augustine, was, not, preoccupied, as, plato, and, descartes, were, in, detailed, efforts, to, explain, the, metaphysics, of, the, soul, body, union, it, sufficed, for, him, to, admit, they, are, metaphysically, distinct, to, be, a, human, is, to, be, a, composite, of, soul, and, body, with, the, soul, superior, to, the, body, the, latter, statement, is, grounded, in, his, hierarchical, classification, of, things, into, those, that, merely, exist, those, that, exist, and, live, and, those, that, exist, live, and, have, intelligence, or, reason, like, other, church, fathers, such, as, athenagoras, tertullian, clement, of, alexandria, and, basil, of, caesarea, augustine, vigorously, condemned, the, practice, of, induced, abortion, and, although, he, disapproved, of, abortion, during, any, stage, of, pregnancy, he, made, a, distinction, between, early, and, later, abortions, he, acknowledged, the, distinction, between, formed, and, unformed, fetuses, mentioned, in, the, septuagint, translation, of, exodus, 21, 22, 23, which, incorrectly, translates, the, word, harm, from, the, original, hebrew, text, as, form, in, the, koine, greek, of, the, septuagint, his, view, was, based, on, the, aristotelian, distinction, between, the, fetus, before, and, after, its, supposed, vivification, therefore, he, did, not, classify, as, murder, the, abortion, of, an, unformed, fetus, since, he, thought, it, could, not, be, known, with, certainty, the, fetus, had, received, a, soul, augustine, held, that, the, timing, of, the, infusion, of, the, soul, was, a, mystery, known, to, god, alone, however, he, considered, procreation, as, one, of, the, goods, of, marriage, abortion, figured, as, a, means, along, with, drugs, which, cause, sterility, of, frustrating, this, good, it, lay, along, a, continuum, which, included, infanticide, as, an, instance, of, lustful, cruelty, or, cruel, lust, augustine, called, the, use, of, means, to, avoid, the, birth, of, a, child, an, evil, work, a, reference, to, either, abortion, or, contraception, or, both, in, city, of, god, augustine, rejected, both, the, contemporary, ideas, of, ages, such, as, those, of, certain, greeks, and, egyptians, that, differed, from, the, church, s, sacred, writings, in, the, literal, interpretation, of, genesis, augustine, argued, that, god, had, created, everything, in, the, universe, simultaneously, and, not, over, a, period, of, six, days, he, argued, the, six, day, structure, of, creation, presented, in, the, book, of, genesis, represents, a, logical, framework, rather, than, the, passage, of, time, in, a, physical, way, it, would, bear, a, spiritual, rather, than, physical, meaning, which, is, no, less, literal, one, reason, for, this, interpretation, is, the, passage, in, sirach, 18, 1, creavit, omnia, simul, he, created, all, things, at, once, which, augustine, took, as, proof, that, the, days, of, genesis, 1, had, to, be, taken, non, literalistically, as, additional, support, for, describing, the, six, days, of, creation, as, a, heuristic, device, augustine, thought, the, actual, event, of, creation, would, be, incomprehensible, by, humans, and, therefore, needed, to, be, translated, augustine, also, does, not, envision, original, sin, as, causing, structural, changes, in, the, universe, and, even, suggests, that, the, bodies, of, adam, and, eve, were, already, created, mortal, before, the, fall, apart, from, his, specific, views, augustine, recognized, that, interpreting, the, creation, story, was, difficult, and, remarked, that, interpretations, could, change, should, new, information, come, up, augustine, developed, his, doctrine, of, the, church, principally, in, reaction, to, the, donatist, sect, he, taught, there, is, one, church, but, within, this, church, there, are, two, realities, namely, the, visible, aspect, the, institutional, hierarchy, the, catholic, sacraments, and, the, laity, and, the, invisible, the, souls, of, those, in, the, church, who, are, either, dead, sinful, members, or, elect, predestined, for, heaven, the, former, is, the, institutional, body, established, by, christ, on, earth, which, proclaims, salvation, and, administers, the, sacraments, while, the, latter, is, the, invisible, body, of, the, elect, made, up, of, genuine, believers, from, all, ages, who, are, known, only, to, god, the, church, which, is, visible, and, societal, will, be, made, up, of, wheat, and, tares, that, is, good, and, wicked, people, as, per, mat, 13, 30, until, the, end, of, time, this, concept, countered, the, donatist, claim, that, only, those, in, a, state, of, grace, were, the, true, or, pure, church, on, earth, and, that, priests, and, bishops, who, were, not, in, a, state, of, grace, had, no, authority, or, ability, to, confect, the, sacraments, augustine, s, ecclesiology, was, more, fully, developed, in, city, of, god, there, he, conceives, of, the, church, as, a, heavenly, city, or, kingdom, ruled, by, love, which, will, ultimately, triumph, over, all, earthly, empires, which, are, self, indulgent, and, ruled, by, pride, augustine, followed, cyprian, in, teaching, that, bishops, and, priests, of, the, church, are, the, successors, of, the, apostles, and, their, authority, in, the, church, is, god, given, the, concept, of, church, invisible, was, advocated, by, augustine, as, part, of, his, refutation, of, the, donatist, sect, though, he, as, other, church, fathers, before, him, saw, the, invisible, church, and, visible, church, as, one, and, the, same, thing, unlike, the, later, protestant, reformers, who, did, not, identify, the, catholic, church, as, the, true, church, he, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, platonist, belief, that, true, reality, is, invisible, and, that, if, the, visible, reflects, the, invisible, it, does, so, only, partially, and, imperfectly, see, theory, of, forms, others, question, whether, augustine, really, held, to, some, form, of, an, invisible, true, church, concept, augustine, originally, believed, in, premillennialism, namely, that, christ, would, establish, a, literal, 1, 000, year, kingdom, prior, to, the, general, resurrection, but, later, rejected, the, belief, viewing, it, as, carnal, during, the, medieval, period, the, catholic, church, built, its, system, of, eschatology, on, augustinian, amillennialism, where, christ, rules, the, earth, spiritually, through, his, triumphant, church, during, the, reformation, theologians, such, as, john, calvin, accepted, amillennialism, augustine, taught, that, the, eternal, fate, of, the, soul, is, determined, at, death, and, that, purgatorial, fires, of, the, intermediate, state, purify, only, those, who, died, in, communion, with, the, church, his, teaching, provided, fuel, for, later, theology, although, augustine, did, not, develop, an, independent, mariology, his, statements, on, mary, surpass, in, number, and, depth, those, of, other, early, writers, even, before, the, council, of, ephesus, he, defended, the, ever, virgin, mary, as, the, mother, of, god, believing, her, to, be, full, of, grace, following, earlier, latin, writers, such, as, jerome, on, account, of, her, sexual, integrity, and, innocence, likewise, he, affirmed, that, the, virgin, mary, conceived, as, virgin, gave, birth, as, virgin, and, stayed, virgin, forever, augustine, took, the, view, that, if, a, literal, interpretation, contradicts, science, and, humans, god, given, reason, the, biblical, text, should, be, interpreted, metaphorically, while, each, passage, of, scripture, has, a, literal, sense, this, literal, sense, does, not, always, mean, the, scriptures, are, mere, history, at, times, they, are, rather, an, extended, metaphor, augustine, taught, that, the, sin, of, adam, and, eve, was, either, an, act, of, foolishness, insipientia, followed, by, pride, and, disobedience, to, god, or, that, pride, came, first, the, first, couple, disobeyed, god, who, had, told, them, not, to, eat, of, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, gen, 2, 17, the, tree, was, a, symbol, of, the, order, of, creation, self, centeredness, made, adam, and, eve, eat, of, it, thus, failing, to, acknowledge, and, respect, the, world, as, it, was, created, by, god, with, its, hierarchy, of, beings, and, values, they, would, not, have, fallen, into, pride, and, lack, of, wisdom, if, satan, had, not, sown, into, their, senses, the, root, of, evil, radix, mali, their, nature, was, wounded, by, concupiscence, or, libido, which, affected, human, intelligence, and, will, as, well, as, affections, and, desires, including, sexual, desire, in, terms, of, metaphysics, concupiscence, is, not, a, state, of, being, but, a, bad, quality, the, privation, of, good, or, a, wound, augustine, s, understanding, of, the, consequences, of, original, sin, and, the, necessity, of, redeeming, grace, was, developed, in, the, struggle, against, pelagius, and, his, pelagian, disciples, caelestius, and, julian, of, eclanum, who, had, been, inspired, by, rufinus, of, syria, a, disciple, of, theodore, of, mopsuestia, they, refused, to, agree, original, sin, wounded, human, will, and, mind, insisting, human, nature, was, given, the, power, to, act, to, speak, and, to, think, when, god, created, it, human, nature, cannot, lose, its, moral, capacity, for, doing, good, but, a, person, is, free, to, act, or, not, act, in, a, righteous, way, pelagius, gave, an, example, of, eyes, they, have, capacity, for, seeing, but, a, person, can, make, either, good, or, bad, use, of, it, pelagians, insisted, human, affections, and, desires, were, not, touched, by, the, fall, either, immorality, e, g, fornication, is, exclusively, a, matter, of, will, i, e, a, person, does, not, use, natural, desires, in, a, proper, way, in, opposition, augustine, pointed, out, the, apparent, disobedience, of, the, flesh, to, the, spirit, and, explained, it, as, one, of, the, results, of, original, sin, punishment, of, adam, and, eve, s, disobedience, to, god, augustine, had, served, as, a, hearer, for, the, manichaeans, for, about, nine, years, who, taught, that, the, original, sin, was, carnal, knowledge, but, his, struggle, to, understand, the, cause, of, evil, in, the, world, started, before, that, at, the, age, of, nineteen, by, malum, evil, he, understood, most, of, all, concupiscence, which, he, interpreted, as, a, vice, dominating, people, and, causing, in, men, and, women, moral, disorder, agostino, trap, insists, augustine, s, personal, experience, cannot, be, credited, for, his, doctrine, about, concupiscence, he, considers, augustine, s, marital, experience, to, be, quite, normal, and, even, exemplary, aside, from, the, absence, of, christian, wedding, rites, as, j, brachtendorf, showed, augustine, used, ciceronian, stoic, concept, of, passions, to, interpret, paul, s, doctrine, of, universal, sin, and, redemption, the, view, that, not, only, human, soul, but, also, senses, were, influenced, by, the, fall, of, adam, and, eve, was, prevalent, in, augustine, s, time, among, the, fathers, of, the, church, it, is, clear, the, reason, for, augustine, s, distancing, from, the, affairs, of, the, flesh, was, different, from, that, of, plotinus, a, neoplatonist, who, taught, that, only, through, disdain, for, fleshly, desire, could, one, reach, the, ultimate, state, of, mankind, augustine, taught, the, redemption, i, e, transformation, and, purification, of, the, body, in, the, resurrection, some, authors, perceive, augustine, s, doctrine, as, directed, against, human, sexuality, and, attribute, his, insistence, on, continence, and, devotion, to, god, as, coming, from, augustine, s, need, to, reject, his, own, highly, sensual, nature, as, described, in, the, confessions, augustine, taught, that, human, sexuality, has, been, wounded, together, with, the, whole, of, human, nature, and, requires, redemption, of, christ, that, healing, is, a, process, realized, in, conjugal, acts, the, virtue, of, continence, is, achieved, thanks, to, the, grace, of, the, sacrament, of, christian, marriage, which, becomes, therefore, a, remedium, concupiscentiae, remedy, of, concupiscence, the, redemption, of, human, sexuality, will, be, however, fully, accomplished, only, in, the, resurrection, of, the, body, the, sin, of, adam, is, inherited, by, all, human, beings, already, in, his, pre, pelagian, writings, augustine, taught, that, original, sin, is, transmitted, to, his, descendants, by, concupiscence, which, he, regarded, as, the, passion, of, both, soul, and, body, making, humanity, a, massa, damnata, mass, of, perdition, condemned, crowd, and, much, enfeebling, though, not, destroying, the, freedom, of, the, will, although, earlier, christian, authors, taught, the, elements, of, physical, death, moral, weakness, and, a, sin, propensity, within, original, sin, augustine, was, the, first, to, add, the, concept, of, inherited, guilt, reatus, from, adam, whereby, an, infant, was, eternally, damned, at, birth, although, augustine, s, anti, pelagian, defence, of, original, sin, was, confirmed, at, numerous, councils, i, e, carthage, 418, ephesus, 431, orange, 529, trent, 1546, and, by, popes, i, e, pope, innocent, i, 401, 417, and, pope, zosimus, 417, 418, his, inherited, guilt, eternally, damning, infants, was, omitted, by, these, councils, and, popes, anselm, of, canterbury, established, in, his, cur, deus, homo, the, definition, that, was, followed, by, the, great, 13th, century, schoolmen, namely, that, original, sin, is, the, privation, of, the, righteousness, which, every, man, ought, to, possess, thus, separating, it, from, concupiscence, with, which, some, of, augustine, s, disciples, had, identified, it, as, later, did, luther, and, calvin, in, 1567, pope, pius, v, condemned, the, identification, of, original, sin, with, concupiscence, augustine, taught, that, god, orders, all, things, while, preserving, human, freedom, prior, to, 396, he, believed, predestination, was, based, on, god, s, foreknowledge, of, whether, individuals, would, believe, in, christ, that, god, s, grace, was, a, reward, for, human, assent, later, in, response, to, pelagius, augustine, said, that, the, sin, of, pride, consists, in, assuming, we, are, the, ones, who, choose, god, or, that, god, chooses, us, in, his, foreknowledge, because, of, something, worthy, in, us, and, argued, that, god, s, grace, causes, the, individual, act, of, faith, scholars, are, divided, over, whether, augustine, s, teaching, implies, double, predestination, or, the, belief, god, chooses, some, people, for, damnation, as, well, as, some, for, salvation, catholic, scholars, tend, to, deny, he, held, such, a, view, while, some, protestants, and, secular, scholars, have, held, that, augustine, did, believe, in, double, predestination, about, 412, augustine, became, the, first, christian, to, understand, predestination, as, a, divine, unilateral, pre, determination, of, individuals, eternal, destinies, independently, of, human, choice, although, his, prior, manichaean, sect, did, teach, this, concept, some, protestant, theologians, such, as, justo, l, gonz, lez, and, bengt, h, gglund, interpret, augustine, s, teaching, that, grace, is, irresistible, results, in, conversion, and, leads, to, perseverance, in, on, rebuke, and, grace, de, correptione, et, gratia, augustine, wrote, and, what, is, written, that, he, wills, all, men, to, be, saved, while, yet, all, men, are, not, saved, may, be, understood, in, many, ways, some, of, which, i, have, mentioned, in, other, writings, of, mine, but, here, i, will, say, one, thing, he, wills, all, men, to, be, saved, is, so, said, that, all, the, predestinated, may, be, understood, by, it, because, every, kind, of, men, is, among, them, speaking, of, the, twins, jacob, and, esau, augustine, wrote, in, his, book, on, the, gift, of, perseverance, t, ought, to, be, a, most, certain, fact, that, the, former, is, of, the, predestinated, the, latter, is, not, also, in, reaction, to, the, donatists, augustine, developed, a, distinction, between, the, regularity, and, validity, of, the, sacraments, regular, sacraments, are, performed, by, clergy, of, the, catholic, church, while, sacraments, performed, by, schismatics, are, considered, irregular, nevertheless, the, validity, of, the, sacraments, does, not, depend, upon, the, holiness, of, the, priests, who, perform, them, ex, opere, operato, therefore, irregular, sacraments, are, still, accepted, as, valid, provided, they, are, done, in, the, name, of, christ, and, in, the, manner, prescribed, by, the, church, on, this, point, augustine, departs, from, the, earlier, teaching, of, cyprian, who, taught, that, converts, from, schismatic, movements, must, be, re, baptised, augustine, taught, that, sacraments, administered, outside, the, catholic, church, though, true, sacraments, avail, nothing, however, he, also, stated, that, baptism, while, it, does, not, confer, any, grace, when, done, outside, the, church, does, confer, grace, as, soon, as, one, is, received, into, the, catholic, church, augustine, is, said, to, have, held, an, understanding, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, saying, that, christ, s, statement, this, is, my, body, referred, to, the, bread, he, carried, in, his, hands, and, that, christians, must, have, faith, the, bread, and, wine, are, in, fact, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, despite, what, they, see, with, their, eyes, for, instance, he, stated, that, he, walked, here, in, the, same, flesh, and, gave, us, the, same, flesh, to, be, eaten, unto, salvation, but, no, one, eats, that, flesh, unless, first, he, adores, it, and, thus, it, is, discovered, how, such, a, footstool, of, the, lord, s, feet, is, adored, and, not, only, do, we, not, sin, by, adoring, we, do, sin, by, not, adoring, presbyterian, professor, and, author, john, riggs, argued, that, augustine, held, that, christ, is, really, present, in, the, elements, of, the, eucharist, but, not, in, a, bodily, manner, because, his, body, remains, in, heaven, augustine, in, his, work, on, christian, doctrine, referred, to, the, eucharist, as, a, figure, and, a, sign, against, the, pelagians, augustine, strongly, stressed, the, importance, of, infant, baptism, about, the, question, whether, baptism, is, an, absolute, necessity, for, salvation, however, augustine, appears, to, have, refined, his, beliefs, during, his, lifetime, causing, some, confusion, among, later, theologians, about, his, position, he, said, in, one, of, his, sermons, that, only, the, baptized, are, saved, this, belief, was, shared, by, many, early, christians, however, a, passage, from, his, city, of, god, concerning, the, apocalypse, may, indicate, augustine, did, believe, in, an, exception, for, children, born, to, christian, parents, augustine, s, contemporaries, often, believed, astrology, to, be, an, exact, and, genuine, science, its, practitioners, were, regarded, as, true, men, of, learning, and, called, mathematici, astrology, played, a, prominent, part, in, manichaean, doctrine, and, augustine, himself, was, attracted, by, their, books, in, his, youth, being, particularly, fascinated, by, those, who, claimed, to, foretell, the, future, later, as, a, bishop, he, warned, that, one, should, avoid, astrologers, who, combine, science, and, horoscopes, augustine, s, term, mathematici, meaning, astrologers, is, sometimes, mistranslated, as, mathematicians, according, to, augustine, they, were, not, genuine, students, of, hipparchus, or, eratosthenes, but, common, swindlers, epistemological, concerns, shaped, augustine, s, intellectual, development, his, early, dialogues, contra, academicos, 386, and, de, magistro, 389, both, written, shortly, after, his, conversion, to, christianity, reflect, his, engagement, with, sceptical, arguments, and, show, the, development, of, his, doctrine, of, divine, illumination, the, doctrine, of, illumination, claims, god, plays, an, active, and, regular, part, in, human, perception, and, understanding, by, illuminating, the, mind, so, human, beings, can, recognize, intelligible, realities, god, presents, as, opposed, to, god, designing, the, human, mind, to, be, reliable, consistently, as, in, for, example, descartes, s, idea, of, clear, and, distinct, perceptions, according, to, augustine, illumination, is, obtainable, to, all, rational, minds, and, is, different, from, other, forms, of, sense, perception, it, is, meant, to, be, an, explanation, of, the, conditions, required, for, the, mind, to, have, a, connection, with, intelligible, entities, augustine, also, posed, the, problem, of, other, minds, throughout, different, works, most, famously, perhaps, in, on, the, trinity, viii, 6, 9, and, developed, what, has, come, to, be, a, standard, solution, the, argument, from, analogy, to, other, minds, in, contrast, to, plato, and, other, earlier, philosophers, augustine, recognized, the, centrality, of, testimony, to, human, knowledge, and, argued, that, what, others, tell, us, can, provide, knowledge, even, if, we, do, not, have, independent, reasons, to, believe, their, testimonial, reports, augustine, asserted, christians, should, be, pacifists, as, a, personal, philosophical, stance, however, peacefulness, in, the, face, of, a, grave, wrong, that, could, only, be, stopped, by, violence, would, be, a, sin, defence, of, one, s, self, or, others, could, be, a, necessity, especially, when, authorized, by, a, legitimate, authority, while, not, breaking, down, the, conditions, necessary, for, war, to, be, just, augustine, coined, the, phrase, in, his, work, the, city, of, god, in, essence, the, pursuit, of, peace, must, include, the, option, of, fighting, for, its, long, term, preservation, such, a, war, could, not, be, pre, emptive, but, defensive, to, restore, peace, thomas, aquinas, centuries, later, used, the, authority, of, augustine, s, arguments, in, an, attempt, to, define, the, conditions, under, which, a, war, could, be, just, included, in, augustine, s, earlier, theodicy, is, the, claim, god, created, humans, and, angels, as, rational, beings, possessing, free, will, free, will, was, not, intended, for, sin, meaning, it, is, not, equally, predisposed, to, both, good, and, evil, a, will, defiled, by, sin, is, not, considered, as, free, as, it, once, was, because, it, is, bound, by, material, things, which, could, be, lost, or, be, difficult, to, part, with, resulting, in, unhappiness, sin, impairs, free, will, while, grace, restores, it, only, a, will, that, was, once, free, can, be, subjected, to, sin, s, corruption, after, 412, augustine, changed, his, theology, teaching, that, humanity, had, no, free, will, to, believe, in, christ, but, only, a, free, will, to, sin, i, in, fact, strove, on, behalf, of, the, free, choice, of, the, human, will, but, god, s, grace, conquered, retract, 2, 1, the, early, christians, opposed, the, deterministic, views, e, g, fate, of, stoics, gnostics, and, manichaeans, prevalent, in, the, first, four, centuries, christians, championed, the, concept, of, a, relational, god, who, interacts, with, humans, rather, than, a, stoic, or, gnostic, god, who, unilaterally, foreordained, every, event, yet, stoics, still, claimed, to, teach, free, will, patristics, scholar, ken, wilson, argues, that, every, early, christian, author, with, extant, writings, who, wrote, on, the, topic, prior, to, augustine, of, hippo, 412, advanced, human, free, choice, rather, than, a, deterministic, god, according, to, wilson, augustine, taught, traditional, free, choice, until, 412, when, he, reverted, to, his, earlier, manichaean, and, stoic, deterministic, training, when, battling, the, pelagians, only, a, few, christians, accepted, augustine, s, view, of, free, will, until, the, protestant, reformation, when, both, luther, and, calvin, embraced, augustine, s, deterministic, teachings, wholeheartedly, the, catholic, church, considers, augustine, s, teaching, to, be, consistent, with, free, will, he, often, said, that, anyone, can, be, saved, if, they, wish, while, god, knows, who, will, and, will, not, be, saved, with, no, possibility, for, the, latter, to, be, saved, in, their, lives, this, knowledge, represents, god, s, perfect, knowledge, of, how, humans, will, freely, choose, their, destinies, augustine, was, among, the, earliest, to, examine, the, legitimacy, of, the, laws, of, man, and, attempt, to, define, the, boundaries, of, what, laws, and, rights, occur, naturally, instead, of, being, arbitrarily, imposed, by, mortals, all, who, have, wisdom, and, conscience, he, concludes, are, able, to, use, reason, to, recognize, the, lex, naturalis, natural, law, mortal, law, should, not, attempt, to, force, people, to, do, what, is, right, or, avoid, what, is, wrong, but, simply, to, remain, just, therefore, an, unjust, law, is, no, law, at, all, people, are, not, obligated, to, obey, laws, that, are, unjust, those, that, their, conscience, and, reason, tell, them, violate, natural, law, and, rights, augustine, led, many, clergy, under, his, authority, at, hippo, to, free, their, slaves, as, a, pious, and, holy, act, he, boldly, wrote, a, letter, urging, the, emperor, to, set, up, a, new, law, against, slave, traders, and, was, very, much, concerned, about, the, sale, of, children, christian, emperors, of, his, time, for, 25, years, had, permitted, the, sale, of, children, not, because, they, approved, of, the, practice, but, as, a, way, of, preventing, infanticide, when, parents, were, unable, to, care, for, a, child, augustine, noted, that, the, tenant, farmers, in, particular, were, driven, to, hire, out, or, to, sell, their, children, as, a, means, of, survival, in, his, book, the, city, of, god, he, presents, the, development, of, slavery, as, a, product, of, sin, and, as, contrary, to, god, s, divine, plan, he, wrote, that, god, did, not, intend, that, this, rational, creature, who, was, made, in, his, image, should, have, dominion, over, anything, but, the, irrational, creation, not, man, over, man, but, man, over, the, beasts, thus, he, wrote, that, righteous, men, in, primitive, times, were, made, shepherds, of, cattle, not, kings, over, men, the, condition, of, slavery, is, the, result, of, sin, he, declared, in, the, city, of, god, augustine, wrote, he, felt, the, existence, of, slavery, was, a, punishment, for, the, existence, of, sin, even, if, an, individual, enslaved, person, committed, no, sin, meriting, punishment, he, wrote, slavery, is, however, penal, and, is, appointed, by, that, law, which, enjoins, the, preservation, of, the, natural, order, and, forbids, its, disturbance, augustine, believed, slavery, did, more, harm, to, the, slave, owner, than, the, enslaved, person, himself, the, lowly, position, does, as, much, good, to, the, servant, as, the, proud, position, does, harm, to, the, master, augustine, proposes, as, a, solution, to, sin, a, type, of, cognitive, reimagining, of, one, s, situation, where, slaves, may, themselves, make, their, slavery, in, some, sort, free, by, serving, not, in, crafty, fear, but, in, faithful, love, until, the, end, of, the, world, eradicated, slavery, for, good, until, all, unrighteousness, pass, away, and, all, principality, and, every, human, power, be, brought, to, nothing, and, god, be, all, in, all, against, certain, christian, movements, some, of, which, rejected, the, use, of, hebrew, scripture, augustine, countered, that, god, had, chosen, the, jews, as, a, special, people, and, he, considered, the, scattering, of, jewish, people, by, the, roman, empire, to, be, a, fulfilment, of, prophecy, he, rejected, homicidal, attitudes, quoting, part, of, the, same, prophecy, namely, slay, them, not, lest, they, should, at, last, forget, thy, law, psalm, 59, 11, augustine, who, believed, jewish, people, would, be, converted, to, christianity, at, the, end, of, time, argued, god, had, allowed, them, to, survive, their, dispersion, as, a, warning, to, christians, as, such, he, argued, they, should, be, permitted, to, dwell, in, christian, lands, the, sentiment, sometimes, attributed, to, augustine, that, christians, should, let, the, jews, survive, but, not, thrive, it, is, repeated, by, the, author, james, carroll, in, his, book, constantine, s, sword, for, example, is, apocryphal, and, is, not, found, in, any, of, his, writings, for, augustine, the, evil, of, sexual, immorality, was, not, in, the, sexual, act, itself, but, in, the, emotions, that, typically, accompany, it, in, on, christian, doctrine, augustine, contrasts, love, which, is, enjoyment, on, account, of, god, and, lust, which, is, not, on, account, of, god, augustine, claims, that, following, the, fall, sexual, lust, concupiscentia, has, become, necessary, for, copulation, as, required, to, stimulate, male, erection, sexual, lust, is, an, evil, result, of, the, fall, and, therefore, evil, must, inevitably, accompany, sexual, intercourse, on, marriage, and, concupiscence, 1, 19, therefore, following, the, fall, even, marital, sex, carried, out, merely, to, procreate, inevitably, perpetuates, evil, on, marriage, and, concupiscence, 1, 27, a, treatise, against, two, letters, of, the, pelagians, 2, 27, for, augustine, proper, love, exercises, a, denial, of, selfish, pleasure, and, the, subjugation, of, corporeal, desire, to, god, the, only, way, to, avoid, evil, caused, by, sexual, intercourse, is, to, take, the, better, way, confessions, 8, 2, and, abstain, from, marriage, on, marriage, and, concupiscence, 1, 31, sex, within, marriage, is, not, however, for, augustine, a, sin, although, necessarily, produces, the, evil, of, sexual, lust, based, on, the, same, logic, augustine, also, declared, the, pious, virgins, raped, during, the, sack, of, rome, to, be, innocent, because, they, did, not, intend, to, sin, nor, enjoy, the, act, before, the, fall, augustine, believed, sex, was, a, passionless, affair, just, like, many, a, laborious, work, accomplished, by, the, compliant, operation, of, our, other, limbs, without, any, lascivious, heat, that, the, seed, might, be, sown, without, any, shameful, lust, the, genital, members, simply, obeying, the, inclination, of, the, will, after, the, fall, by, contrast, the, penis, cannot, be, controlled, by, mere, will, subject, instead, to, both, unwanted, impotence, and, involuntary, erections, sometimes, the, urge, arises, unwanted, sometimes, on, the, other, hand, it, forsakes, the, eager, lover, and, desire, grows, cold, in, the, body, while, burning, in, the, mind, it, arouses, the, mind, but, it, does, not, follow, through, what, it, has, begun, and, arouse, the, body, also, city, of, god, 14, 16, augustine, censured, those, who, try, to, prevent, the, creation, of, offspring, when, engaging, in, sexual, relations, saying, that, though, they, may, be, nominally, married, they, are, not, really, but, are, using, that, designation, as, a, cloak, for, turpitude, when, they, allow, their, unwanted, children, to, die, of, exposure, they, unmask, their, sin, sometimes, they, use, drugs, to, produce, sterility, or, other, means, to, try, to, destroy, the, fetus, before, they, are, born, their, marriage, is, not, wedlock, but, debauchery, augustine, believed, adam, and, eve, had, both, already, chosen, in, their, hearts, to, disobey, god, s, command, not, to, eat, of, the, tree, of, knowledge, before, eve, took, the, fruit, ate, it, and, gave, it, to, adam, accordingly, augustine, did, not, believe, adam, was, any, less, guilty, of, sin, augustine, praises, women, and, their, role, in, society, and, in, the, church, in, his, tractates, on, the, gospel, of, john, augustine, commenting, on, the, samaritan, woman, from, john, 4, 1, 42, uses, the, woman, as, a, figure, of, the, church, in, agreement, with, the, new, testament, teaching, that, the, church, is, the, bride, of, christ, husbands, love, your, wives, as, christ, loved, the, church, and, gave, himself, up, for, her, augustine, believed, that, woman, has, been, made, for, man, and, that, in, sex, she, is, physically, subject, to, him, in, the, same, way, as, our, natural, impulses, need, to, be, subjected, to, the, reasoning, power, of, the, mind, in, order, that, the, actions, to, which, they, lead, may, be, inspired, by, the, principles, of, good, conduct, women, were, created, as, a, helper, to, men, for, augustine, augustine, is, considered, an, influential, figure, in, the, history, of, education, a, work, early, in, augustine, s, writings, is, de, magistro, on, the, teacher, which, contains, insights, into, education, his, ideas, changed, as, he, found, better, directions, or, better, ways, of, expressing, his, ideas, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, augustine, wrote, his, retractationes, retractations, reviewing, his, writings, and, improving, specific, texts, henry, chadwick, believes, an, accurate, translation, of, retractationes, may, be, reconsiderations, reconsiderations, can, be, seen, as, an, overarching, theme, of, the, way, augustine, learned, augustine, s, understanding, of, the, search, for, understanding, meaning, and, truth, as, a, restless, journey, leaves, room, for, doubt, development, and, change, augustine, was, a, strong, advocate, of, critical, thinking, skills, because, written, works, were, limited, during, this, time, spoken, communication, of, knowledge, was, very, important, his, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, community, as, a, means, of, learning, distinguishes, his, pedagogy, from, some, others, augustine, believed, dialectic, is, the, best, means, for, learning, and, that, this, method, should, serve, as, a, model, for, learning, encounters, between, teachers, and, students, augustine, s, dialogue, writings, model, the, need, for, lively, interactive, dialogue, among, learners, he, recommended, adapting, educational, practices, to, fit, the, students, educational, backgrounds, if, a, student, has, been, well, educated, in, a, wide, variety, of, subjects, the, teacher, must, be, careful, not, to, repeat, what, they, have, already, learned, but, to, challenge, the, student, with, material, they, do, not, yet, know, thoroughly, with, the, student, who, has, had, no, education, the, teacher, must, be, patient, willing, to, repeat, things, until, the, student, understands, and, sympathetic, perhaps, the, most, difficult, student, however, is, the, one, with, an, inferior, education, who, believes, he, understands, something, when, he, does, not, augustine, stressed, the, importance, of, showing, this, type, of, student, the, difference, between, having, words, and, having, understanding, and, of, helping, the, student, to, remain, humble, with, his, acquisition, of, knowledge, under, the, influence, of, bede, alcuin, and, rabanus, maurus, de, catechizandis, rudibus, came, to, exercise, an, important, role, in, the, education, of, clergy, at, the, monastic, schools, especially, from, the, eighth, century, onwards, augustine, believed, students, should, be, given, an, opportunity, to, apply, learned, theories, to, practical, experience, yet, another, of, augustine, s, major, contributions, to, education, is, his, study, on, the, styles, of, teaching, he, claimed, there, are, two, basic, styles, a, teacher, uses, when, speaking, to, the, students, the, mixed, style, includes, complex, and, sometimes, showy, language, to, help, students, see, the, beautiful, artistry, of, the, subject, they, are, studying, the, grand, style, is, not, quite, as, elegant, as, the, mixed, style, but, is, exciting, and, heartfelt, with, the, purpose, of, igniting, the, same, passion, in, the, students, hearts, augustine, balanced, his, teaching, philosophy, with, the, traditional, bible, based, practice, of, strict, discipline, augustine, knew, latin, and, ancient, greek, he, had, a, long, correspondence, with, st, jerome, regarding, the, textual, differences, existing, between, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, greek, septuagint, concluding, that, the, original, greek, manuscripts, were, closely, similar, to, the, other, hebrew, ones, and, also, that, even, the, differences, in, the, two, original, versions, of, the, holy, scripture, could, enlight, its, spiritual, meaning, to, have, been, unitarily, inspired, by, god, augustine, of, hippo, had, to, deal, with, issues, of, violence, and, coercion, throughout, his, entire, career, due, largely, to, the, donatist, catholic, conflict, he, is, one, of, the, very, few, authors, in, antiquity, who, ever, truly, theoretically, examined, the, ideas, of, religious, freedom, and, coercion, 107, augustine, handled, the, infliction, of, punishment, and, the, exercise, of, power, over, law, breakers, by, analyzing, these, issues, in, ways, similar, to, modern, debates, on, penal, reform, his, teaching, on, coercion, has, embarrassed, his, modern, defenders, and, vexed, his, modern, detractors, 116, because, it, is, seen, as, making, him, appear, to, generations, of, religious, liberals, as, le, prince, et, patriarche, de, persecuteurs, 107, yet, brown, asserts, that, at, the, same, time, augustine, becomes, an, eloquent, advocate, of, the, ideal, of, corrective, punishment, and, reformation, of, the, wrongdoer, russell, says, augustine, s, theory, of, coercion, was, not, crafted, from, dogma, but, in, response, to, a, unique, historical, situation, and, is, therefore, context, dependent, while, others, see, it, as, inconsistent, with, his, other, teachings, 125, during, the, great, persecution, when, roman, soldiers, came, calling, some, of, the, officials, handed, over, the, sacred, books, vessels, and, other, church, goods, rather, than, risk, legal, penalties, over, a, few, objects, ix, maureen, tilley, says, this, was, a, problem, by, 305, that, became, a, schism, by, 311, because, many, of, the, north, african, christians, had, a, long, established, tradition, of, a, physicalist, approach, to, religion, xv, the, sacred, scriptures, were, not, simply, books, to, them, but, were, the, word, of, god, in, physical, form, therefore, they, saw, handing, over, the, bible, and, handing, over, a, person, to, be, martyred, as, two, sides, of, the, same, coin, ix, those, who, cooperated, with, the, authorities, became, known, as, traditores, the, term, originally, meant, one, who, hands, over, a, physical, object, but, it, came, to, mean, traitor, ix, according, to, tilley, after, the, persecution, ended, those, who, had, apostatized, wanted, to, return, to, their, positions, in, the, church, xiv, the, north, african, christians, the, rigorists, who, became, known, as, donatists, refused, to, accept, them, ix, x, catholics, were, more, tolerant, and, wanted, to, wipe, the, slate, clean, xiv, 69, for, the, next, 75, years, both, parties, existed, often, directly, alongside, each, other, with, a, double, line, of, bishops, for, the, same, cities, xv, competition, for, the, loyalty, of, the, people, included, multiple, new, churches, and, violence, 334, no, one, is, exactly, sure, when, the, circumcellions, and, the, donatists, allied, but, for, decades, they, fomented, protests, and, street, violence, accosted, travellers, and, attacked, random, catholics, without, warning, often, doing, serious, and, unprovoked, bodily, harm, such, as, beating, people, with, clubs, cutting, off, their, hands, and, feet, and, gouging, out, eyes, 172, 173, 222, 242, 254, augustine, became, coadjutor, bishop, of, hippo, in, 395, and, since, he, believed, that, conversion, must, be, voluntary, his, appeals, to, the, donatists, were, verbal, for, several, years, he, used, popular, propaganda, debate, personal, appeal, general, councils, appeals, to, the, emperor, and, political, pressure, to, bring, the, donatists, back, into, union, with, the, catholics, but, all, attempts, failed, 242, 254, the, harsh, realities, augustine, faced, can, be, found, in, his, letter, 28, written, to, bishop, novatus, around, 416, donatists, had, attacked, cut, out, the, tongue, and, cut, off, the, hands, of, a, bishop, rogatus, who, had, recently, converted, to, catholicism, an, unnamed, count, of, africa, had, sent, his, agent, with, rogatus, and, he, too, had, been, attacked, the, count, was, inclined, to, pursue, the, matter, 120, russell, says, augustine, demonstrates, a, hands, on, involvement, with, the, details, of, his, bishopric, but, at, one, point, in, the, letter, he, confesses, he, does, not, know, what, to, do, all, the, issues, that, plague, him, are, there, stubborn, donatists, circumcellion, violence, the, vacillating, role, of, secular, officials, the, imperative, to, persuade, and, his, own, trepidations, 120, 121, the, empire, responded, to, the, civil, unrest, with, the, law, and, its, enforcement, and, thereafter, augustine, changed, his, mind, about, using, verbal, arguments, alone, instead, he, came, to, support, the, state, s, use, of, coercion, 107, 116, augustine, did, not, believe, the, empire, s, enforcement, would, make, the, donatists, more, virtuous, but, he, did, believe, it, would, make, them, less, vicious, 128, the, primary, proof, text, of, what, augustine, thought, concerning, coercion, is, from, letter, 93, written, in, 408, as, a, reply, to, bishop, vincentius, of, cartenna, mauretania, north, africa, this, letter, shows, that, both, practical, and, biblical, reasons, led, augustine, to, defend, the, legitimacy, of, coercion, he, confesses, that, he, changed, his, mind, because, of, the, ineffectiveness, of, dialogue, and, the, proven, efficacy, of, laws, 3, he, had, been, worried, about, false, conversions, if, force, was, used, but, now, he, says, it, seems, imperial, persecution, is, working, many, donatists, had, converted, 116, fear, had, made, them, reflect, and, made, them, docile, 3, augustine, continued, to, assert, that, coercion, could, not, directly, convert, someone, but, concluded, it, could, make, a, person, ready, to, be, reasoned, with, 103, 121, according, to, mar, marcos, augustine, made, use, of, several, biblical, examples, to, legitimize, coercion, but, the, primary, analogy, in, letter, 93, and, in, letter, 185, is, the, parable, of, the, great, feast, in, luke, 14, 15, 24, and, its, statement, compel, them, to, come, in, 1, russell, says, augustine, uses, the, latin, term, cogo, instead, of, the, compello, of, the, vulgate, since, to, augustine, cogo, meant, to, gather, together, or, collect, and, was, not, simply, compel, by, physical, force, 121, in, 1970, robert, markus, argued, that, for, augustine, a, degree, of, external, pressure, being, brought, for, the, purpose, of, reform, was, compatible, with, the, exercise, of, free, will, russell, asserts, that, confessions, 13, is, crucial, to, understanding, augustine, s, thought, on, coercion, using, peter, brown, s, explanation, of, augustine, s, view, of, salvation, he, explains, that, augustine, s, past, his, own, sufferings, and, conversion, through, god, s, pressures, along, with, his, biblical, hermeneutics, is, what, led, him, to, see, the, value, in, suffering, for, discerning, truth, 116, 117, according, to, russell, augustine, saw, coercion, as, one, among, many, conversion, strategies, for, forming, a, pathway, to, the, inner, person, 119, in, augustine, s, view, there, is, such, a, thing, as, just, and, unjust, persecution, augustine, explains, that, when, the, purpose, of, persecution, is, to, lovingly, correct, and, instruct, then, it, becomes, discipline, and, is, just, 2, he, said, the, church, would, discipline, its, people, out, of, a, loving, desire, to, heal, them, and, that, once, compelled, to, come, in, heretics, would, gradually, give, their, voluntary, assent, to, the, truth, of, christian, orthodoxy, 115, frederick, h, russell, describes, this, as, a, pastoral, strategy, in, which, the, church, did, the, persecuting, with, the, dutiful, assistance, of, roman, authorities, 115, adding, that, it, is, a, precariously, balanced, blend, of, external, discipline, and, inward, nurturance, 125, augustine, placed, limits, on, the, use, of, coercion, recommending, fines, imprisonment, banishment, and, moderate, floggings, preferring, beatings, with, rods, which, was, a, common, practice, in, the, ecclesial, courts, 164, he, opposed, severity, maiming, and, the, execution, of, heretics, 768, while, these, limits, were, mostly, ignored, by, roman, authorities, michael, lamb, says, that, in, doing, this, augustine, appropriates, republican, principles, from, his, roman, predecessors, and, maintains, his, commitment, to, liberty, legitimate, authority, and, the, rule, of, law, as, a, constraint, on, arbitrary, power, he, continues, to, advocate, holding, authority, accountable, to, prevent, domination, but, affirms, the, state, s, right, to, act, herbert, a, deane, on, the, other, hand, says, there, is, a, fundamental, inconsistency, between, augustine, s, political, thought, and, his, final, position, of, approval, of, the, use, of, political, and, legal, weapons, to, punish, religious, dissidence, and, others, have, seconded, this, view, brown, asserts, that, augustine, s, thinking, on, coercion, is, more, of, an, attitude, than, a, doctrine, since, it, is, not, in, a, state, of, rest, but, is, instead, marked, by, a, painful, and, protracted, attempt, to, embrace, and, resolve, tensions, 107, according, to, russell, it, is, possible, to, see, how, augustine, himself, had, evolved, from, his, earlier, confessions, to, this, teaching, on, coercion, and, the, latter, s, strong, patriarchal, nature, intellectually, the, burden, has, shifted, imperceptibly, from, discovering, the, truth, to, disseminating, the, truth, 129, the, bishops, had, become, the, church, s, elite, with, their, own, rationale, for, acting, as, stewards, of, the, truth, russell, points, out, that, augustine, s, views, are, limited, to, time, and, place, and, his, own, community, but, later, others, took, what, he, said, and, applied, it, outside, those, parameters, in, ways, augustine, never, imagined, or, intended, 129, augustine, was, one, of, the, most, prolific, latin, authors, in, terms, of, surviving, works, and, the, list, of, his, works, consists, of, more, than, one, hundred, separate, titles, they, include, apologetic, works, against, the, heresies, of, the, arians, donatists, manichaeans, and, pelagians, texts, on, christian, doctrine, notably, de, doctrina, christiana, on, christian, doctrine, exegetical, works, such, as, commentaries, on, genesis, the, psalms, and, paul, s, letter, to, the, romans, many, sermons, and, letters, and, the, retractationes, a, review, of, his, earlier, works, which, he, wrote, near, the, end, of, his, life, apart, from, those, augustine, is, probably, best, known, for, his, confessions, which, is, a, personal, account, of, his, earlier, life, and, for, de, civitate, dei, the, city, of, god, consisting, of, 22, books, which, he, wrote, to, restore, the, confidence, of, his, fellow, christians, which, was, badly, shaken, by, the, sack, of, rome, by, the, visigoths, in, 410, his, on, the, trinity, in, which, he, developed, what, has, become, known, as, the, psychological, analogy, of, the, trinity, is, also, considered, to, be, among, his, masterpieces, and, arguably, of, more, doctrinal, importance, than, the, confessions, or, the, city, of, god, he, also, wrote, on, free, choice, of, the, will, de, libero, arbitrio, addressing, why, god, gives, humans, free, will, that, can, be, used, for, evil, in, both, his, philosophical, and, theological, reasoning, augustine, was, greatly, influenced, by, stoicism, platonism, and, neoplatonism, particularly, by, the, work, of, plotinus, author, of, the, enneads, probably, through, the, mediation, of, porphyry, and, victorinus, as, pierre, hadot, has, argued, some, neoplatonic, concepts, are, still, visible, in, augustine, s, early, writings, his, early, and, influential, writing, on, the, human, will, a, central, topic, in, ethics, would, become, a, focus, for, later, philosophers, such, as, schopenhauer, kierkegaard, and, nietzsche, he, was, also, influenced, by, the, works, of, virgil, known, for, his, teaching, on, language, and, cicero, known, for, his, teaching, on, argument, philosopher, bertrand, russell, was, impressed, by, augustine, s, meditation, on, the, nature, of, time, in, the, confessions, comparing, it, favourably, to, kant, s, version, of, the, view, that, time, is, subjective, catholic, theologians, generally, subscribe, to, augustine, s, belief, that, god, exists, outside, of, time, in, the, eternal, present, that, time, only, exists, within, the, created, universe, because, only, in, space, is, time, discernible, through, motion, and, change, his, meditations, on, the, nature, of, time, are, closely, linked, to, his, consideration, of, the, human, ability, of, memory, frances, yates, in, her, 1966, study, the, art, of, memory, argues, that, a, brief, passage, of, the, confessions, 10, 8, 12, in, which, augustine, writes, of, walking, up, a, flight, of, stairs, and, entering, the, vast, fields, of, memory, clearly, indicates, that, the, ancient, romans, were, aware, of, how, to, use, explicit, spatial, and, architectural, metaphors, as, a, mnemonic, technique, for, organizing, large, amounts, of, information, augustine, s, philosophical, method, especially, demonstrated, in, his, confessions, had, a, continuing, influence, on, continental, philosophy, throughout, the, 20th, century, his, descriptive, approach, to, intentionality, memory, and, language,
