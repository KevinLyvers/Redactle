critics, such, as, adrian, martin, have, called, the, style, of, filmmaking, in, the, koker, trilogy, as, diagrammatical, linking, the, zig, zagging, patterns, in, the, landscape, and, the, geometry, of, forces, of, life, and, the, world, a, flashback, of, the, zigzag, path, in, life, and, nothing, more, 1992, in, turn, triggers, the, spectator, s, memory, of, the, previous, film, where, is, the,

means, of, a, stranger, s, sojourn, in, a, remote, kurdish, village, an, unusual, feature, of, the, movie, is, that, many, of, the, characters, are, heard, but, not, seen, at, least, thirteen, to, fourteen, speaking, characters, in, the, film, are, never, seen, in, 2000, at, the, san, francisco, film, festival, award, ceremony, kiarostami, was, awarded, the, akira, kurosawa, prize, for, lifetime, achievement, in, directing, but, surprised, everyone, by, giving, it, away, to, veteran, iranian, actor, behrooz, vossoughi, for, his, contribution, to, iranian, cinema, in, 2001, kiarostami, and, his, assistant, seifollah, samadian, traveled, to, kampala, uganda, at, the, request, of, the, united, nations, international, fund, for, agricultural, development, to, film, a, documentary, about, programs, assisting, ugandan, orphans, he, stayed, for, ten, days, and, made, abc, africa, the, trip, was, originally, intended, as, research, in, preparation, for, the, filming, but, kiarostami, ended, up, editing, the, entire, film, from, the, video, footage, shot, there, the, high, number, of, orphans, in, uganda, has, resulted, from, the, deaths, of, parents, in, the, aids, epidemic, time, out, editor, and, national, film, theatre, chief, programmer, geoff, andrew, said, in, referring, to, the, film, like, his, previous, four, features, this, film, is, not, about, death, but, life, and, death, how, they, re, linked, and, what, attitude, we, might, adopt, with, regard, to, their, symbiotic, inevitability, the, following, year, kiarostami, directed, ten, revealing, an, unusual, method, of, filmmaking, and, abandoning, many, scriptwriting, conventions, kiarostami, focused, on, the, socio, political, landscape, of, iran, the, images, are, seen, through, the, eyes, of, one, woman, as, she, drives, through, the, streets, of, tehran, over, a, period, of, several, days, her, journey, is, composed, of, ten, conversations, with, various, passengers, which, include, her, sister, a, hitchhiking, prostitute, and, a, jilted, bride, and, her, demanding, young, son, this, style, of, filmmaking, was, praised, by, a, number, of, critics, a, o, scott, in, the, new, york, times, wrote, that, kiarostami, in, addition, to, being, perhaps, the, most, internationally, admired, iranian, filmmaker, of, the, past, decade, is, also, among, the, world, masters, of, automotive, cinema, he, understands, the, automobile, as, a, place, of, reflection, observation, and, above, all, talk, in, 2003, kiarostami, directed, five, a, poetic, feature, with, no, dialogue, or, characterization, it, consists, of, five, long, shots, of, nature, which, are, single, take, sequences, shot, with, a, hand, held, dv, camera, along, the, shores, of, the, caspian, sea, although, the, film, lacks, a, clear, storyline, geoff, andrew, argues, that, the, film, is, more, than, just, pretty, pictures, he, adds, assembled, in, order, they, comprise, a, kind, of, abstract, or, emotional, narrative, arc, which, moves, evocatively, from, separation, and, solitude, to, community, from, motion, to, rest, near, silence, to, sound, and, song, light, to, darkness, and, back, to, light, again, ending, on, a, note, of, rebirth, and, regeneration, he, notes, the, degree, of, artifice, concealed, behind, the, apparent, simplicity, of, the, imagery, in, 2005, kiarostami, contributed, the, central, section, to, tickets, a, portmanteau, film, set, on, a, train, traveling, through, italy, the, other, segments, were, directed, by, ken, loach, and, ermanno, olmi, in, 2008, kiarostami, directed, the, feature, shirin, which, features, close, ups, of, many, notable, iranian, actresses, and, the, french, actress, juliette, binoche, as, they, watch, a, film, based, on, a, partly, mythological, persian, romance, tale, of, khosrow, and, shirin, with, themes, of, female, self, sacrifice, the, film, has, been, described, as, a, compelling, exploration, of, the, relationship, between, image, sound, and, female, spectatorship, that, summer, he, directed, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, s, opera, cos, fan, tutte, conducted, by, christophe, rousset, at, festival, d, aix, en, provence, starring, with, william, shimell, but, the, following, year, s, performances, at, the, english, national, opera, was, impossible, to, direct, because, of, refusal, of, permission, to, travel, abroad, certified, copy, 2010, again, starring, juliette, binoche, was, made, in, tuscany, and, was, kiarostami, s, first, film, to, be, shot, and, produced, outside, iran, the, story, of, an, encounter, between, a, british, man, and, a, french, woman, it, was, entered, in, competition, for, the, palme, d, or, in, the, 2010, cannes, film, festival, peter, bradshaw, of, the, guardian, describes, the, film, as, an, intriguing, oddity, and, said, certified, copy, is, the, deconstructed, portrait, of, a, marriage, acted, with, well, intentioned, fervour, by, juliette, binoche, but, persistently, baffling, contrived, and, often, simply, bizarre, a, highbrow, misfire, of, the, most, peculiar, sort, he, concluded, that, the, film, is, unmistakably, an, example, of, kiarostami, s, compositional, technique, though, not, a, successful, example, roger, ebert, however, praised, the, film, noting, that, kiarostami, is, rather, brilliant, in, the, way, he, creates, offscreen, spaces, binoche, won, the, best, actress, award, at, cannes, for, her, performance, in, the, film, kiarostami, s, penultimate, film, like, someone, in, love, set, and, shot, in, japan, received, largely, positive, reviews, from, critics, kiarostami, s, final, film, 24, frames, was, released, posthumously, in, 2017, an, experimental, film, based, on, 24, of, kiarostami, s, still, photographs, 24, frames, enjoyed, a, highly, positive, critical, reception, with, a, rotten, tomatoes, score, of, 92, kiarostami, was, a, jury, member, at, numerous, film, festivals, most, notably, the, cannes, film, festival, in, 1993, 2002, and, 2005, he, was, also, the, president, of, the, cam, ra, d, or, jury, in, cannes, film, festival, 2005, he, was, announced, as, the, president, of, the, cin, fondation, and, short, film, sections, of, the, 2014, cannes, film, festival, other, representatives, include, the, venice, film, festival, in, 1985, the, locarno, international, film, festival, in, 1990, the, san, sebastian, international, film, festival, in, 1996, the, s, o, paulo, international, film, festival, in, 2004, the, capalbio, cinema, festival, in, 2007, in, which, he, was, president, of, the, jury, and, the, k, stendorf, film, and, music, festival, in, 2011, he, also, made, regular, appearances, at, many, other, film, festivals, across, europe, including, the, estoril, film, festival, in, portugal, though, kiarostami, has, been, compared, to, satyajit, ray, vittorio, de, sica, ric, rohmer, and, jacques, tati, his, films, exhibit, a, singular, style, often, employing, techniques, of, his, own, invention, during, the, filming, of, the, bread, and, alley, in, 1970, kiarostami, had, major, differences, with, his, experienced, cinematographer, about, how, to, film, the, boy, and, the, attacking, dog, while, the, cinematographer, wanted, separate, shots, of, the, boy, approaching, a, close, up, of, his, hand, as, he, enters, the, house, and, closes, the, door, followed, by, a, shot, of, the, dog, kiarostami, believed, that, if, the, three, scenes, could, be, captured, as, a, whole, it, would, have, a, more, profound, impact, in, creating, tension, over, the, situation, that, one, shot, took, around, forty, days, to, complete, until, kiarostami, was, fully, content, with, the, scene, kiarostami, later, commented, that, the, breaking, of, scenes, would, have, disrupted, the, rhythm, and, content, of, the, film, s, structure, preferring, to, let, the, scene, flow, as, one, unlike, other, directors, kiarostami, showed, no, interest, in, staging, extravagant, combat, scenes, or, complicated, chase, scenes, in, large, scale, productions, instead, attempting, to, mold, the, medium, of, film, to, his, own, specifications, kiarostami, appeared, to, have, settled, on, his, style, with, the, koker, trilogy, which, included, a, myriad, of, references, to, his, own, film, material, connecting, common, themes, and, subject, matter, between, each, of, the, films, stephen, bransford, has, contended, that, kiarostami, s, films, do, not, contain, references, to, the, work, of, other, directors, but, are, fashioned, in, such, a, manner, that, they, are, self, referenced, bransford, believes, his, films, are, often, fashioned, into, an, ongoing, dialectic, with, one, film, reflecting, on, and, partially, demystifying, an, earlier, film, he, continued, experimenting, with, new, modes, of, filming, using, different, directorial, methods, and, techniques, a, case, in, point, is, ten, which, was, filmed, in, a, moving, automobile, in, which, kiarostami, was, not, present, he, gave, suggestions, to, the, actors, about, what, to, do, and, a, camera, placed, on, the, dashboard, filmed, them, while, they, drove, around, tehran, the, camera, was, allowed, to, roll, capturing, the, faces, of, the, people, involved, during, their, daily, routine, using, a, series, of, extreme, close, shots, ten, was, an, experiment, that, used, digital, cameras, to, virtually, eliminate, the, director, this, new, direction, towards, a, digital, micro, cinema, is, defined, as, a, micro, budget, filmmaking, practice, allied, with, a, digital, production, basis, kiarostami, s, cinema, offers, a, different, definition, of, film, according, to, film, professors, such, as, jamsheed, akrami, of, william, paterson, university, kiarostami, consistently, tried, to, redefine, film, by, forcing, the, increased, involvement, of, the, audience, in, his, later, years, he, also, progressively, trimmed, the, timespan, within, his, films, akrami, thinks, that, this, reduces, filmmaking, from, a, collective, endeavor, to, a, purer, more, basic, form, of, artistic, expression, kiarostami, s, films, contain, a, notable, degree, of, ambiguity, an, unusual, mixture, of, simplicity, and, complexity, and, often, a, mix, of, fictional, and, documentary, elements, docufiction, kiarostami, has, stated, we, can, never, get, close, to, the, truth, except, through, lying, the, boundary, between, fiction, and, non, fiction, is, significantly, reduced, in, kiarostami, s, cinema, the, french, philosopher, jean, luc, nancy, writing, about, kiarostami, and, in, particular, life, and, nothing, more, has, argued, that, his, films, are, neither, quite, fiction, nor, quite, documentary, life, and, nothing, more, he, argues, is, neither, representation, nor, reportage, but, rather, evidence, t, all, looks, like, reporting, but, everything, underscores, indique, l, vidence, that, it, is, the, fiction, of, a, documentary, in, fact, kiarostami, shot, the, film, several, months, after, the, earthquake, and, that, it, is, rather, a, document, about, fiction, not, in, the, sense, of, imagining, the, unreal, but, in, the, very, specific, and, precise, sense, of, the, technique, of, the, art, of, constructing, images, for, the, image, by, means, of, which, each, time, each, opens, a, world, and, precedes, himself, in, it, s, y, pr, c, de, is, not, pregiven, donn, e, toute, faite, as, are, those, of, dreams, phantasms, or, bad, films, it, is, to, be, invented, cut, and, edited, thus, it, is, evidence, insofar, as, if, one, day, i, happen, to, look, at, my, street, on, which, i, walk, up, and, down, ten, times, a, day, i, construct, for, an, instant, a, new, evidence, of, my, street, for, jean, luc, nancy, this, notion, of, cinema, as, evidence, rather, than, as, documentary, or, imagination, is, tied, to, the, way, kiarostami, deals, with, life, and, death, cf, the, remark, by, geoff, andrew, on, abc, africa, cited, above, to, the, effect, that, kiarostami, s, films, are, not, about, death, but, about, life, and, death, existence, resists, the, indifference, of, life, and, death, it, lives, beyond, mechanical, life, it, is, always, its, own, mourning, and, its, own, joy, it, becomes, figure, image, it, does, not, become, alienated, in, images, but, it, is, presented, there, the, images, are, the, evidence, of, its, existence, the, objectivity, of, its, assertion, this, thought, which, for, me, is, the, very, thought, of, this, film, is, a, difficult, thought, perhaps, the, most, difficult, it, s, a, slow, thought, always, underway, fraying, a, path, so, that, the, path, itself, becomes, thought, it, is, that, which, frays, images, so, that, images, become, this, thought, so, that, they, become, the, evidence, of, this, thought, and, not, to, represent, it, in, other, words, wanting, to, accomplish, more, than, just, represent, life, and, death, as, opposing, forces, but, rather, to, illustrate, the, way, in, which, each, element, of, nature, is, inextricably, linked, kiarostami, devised, a, cinema, that, does, more, than, just, present, the, viewer, with, the, documentable, facts, but, neither, is, it, simply, a, matter, of, artifice, because, existence, means, more, than, simply, life, it, is, projective, containing, an, irreducibly, fictive, element, but, in, this, being, more, than, life, it, is, therefore, contaminated, by, mortality, nancy, is, giving, a, clue, in, other, words, toward, the, interpretation, of, kiarostami, s, statement, that, lying, is, the, only, way, to, truth, the, concepts, of, change, and, continuity, in, addition, to, the, themes, of, life, and, death, play, a, major, role, in, kiarostami, s, works, in, the, koker, trilogy, these, themes, play, a, central, role, as, illustrated, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1990, manjil, rudbar, earthquake, disaster, they, also, represent, the, power, of, human, resilience, to, overcome, and, defy, destruction, unlike, the, koker, films, which, convey, an, instinctual, thirst, for, survival, taste, of, cherry, explores, the, fragility, of, life, and, focuses, on, how, precious, it, is, some, film, critics, believe, that, the, assemblage, of, light, versus, dark, scenes, in, kiarostami, s, film, grammar, such, as, in, taste, of, cherry, and, the, wind, will, carry, us, suggests, the, mutual, existence, of, life, with, its, endless, possibilities, and, death, as, a, factual, moment, of, anyone, s, life, ahmad, karimi, hakkak, of, the, university, of, maryland, argues, that, one, aspect, of, kiarostami, s, cinematic, style, is, that, he, is, able, to, capture, the, essence, of, persian, poetry, and, create, poetic, imagery, within, the, landscape, of, his, films, in, several, of, his, movies, such, as, where, is, the, friend, s, home, and, the, wind, will, carry, us, classical, persian, poetry, is, directly, quoted, in, the, film, highlighting, the, artistic, link, and, intimate, connection, between, them, this, in, turn, reflects, on, the, connection, between, the, past, and, present, between, continuity, and, change, the, characters, recite, poems, mainly, from, classical, persian, poet, omar, khayy, m, or, modern, persian, poets, such, as, sohrab, sepehri, and, forough, farrokhzad, one, scene, in, the, wind, will, carry, us, has, a, long, shot, of, a, wheat, field, with, rippling, golden, crops, through, which, the, doctor, accompanied, by, the, filmmaker, is, riding, his, scooter, in, a, twisting, road, in, response, to, the, comment, that, the, other, world, is, a, better, place, than, this, one, the, doctor, recites, this, poem, of, khayyam, they, promise, of, houries, in, heaven, but, i, would, say, wine, is, better, take, the, present, to, the, promises, a, drum, sounds, melodious, from, distance, it, has, been, argued, that, the, creative, merit, of, kiarostami, s, adaptation, of, sohrab, sepehri, and, forough, farrokhzad, s, poems, extends, the, domain, of, textual, transformation, adaptation, is, defined, as, the, transformation, of, a, prior, to, a, new, text, sima, daad, of, the, university, of, washington, contends, that, kiarostami, s, adaptation, arrives, at, the, theoretical, realm, of, adaptation, by, expanding, its, limit, from, inter, textual, potential, to, trans, generic, potential, kiarostami, s, complex, sound, images, and, philosophical, approach, have, caused, frequent, comparisons, with, mystical, filmmakers, such, as, andrei, tarkovsky, and, robert, bresson, while, acknowledging, substantial, cultural, differences, much, of, western, critical, writing, about, kiarostami, positions, him, as, the, iranian, equivalent, of, such, directors, by, virtue, of, a, similarly, austere, spiritual, poetics, and, moral, commitment, some, draw, parallels, between, certain, imagery, in, kiarostami, s, films, with, that, of, sufi, concepts, while, most, english, language, writers, such, as, david, sterritt, and, the, spanish, film, professor, alberto, elena, interpret, kiarostami, s, films, as, spiritual, other, critics, including, david, walsh, and, hamish, ford, have, rated, the, influence, of, spirituality, in, his, films, as, lower, kiarostami, along, with, jean, cocteau, satyajit, ray, pier, paolo, pasolini, derek, jarman, and, alejandro, jodorowsky, was, a, filmmaker, who, expressed, himself, in, other,

and, his, films, the, results, of, the, analysis, reveal, how, kiarostami, s, treatment, of, uncertain, reality, is, similar, in, his, poems, and, films, kiarostami, s, poetry, is, reminiscent, of, the, later, nature, poems, of, the, persian, painter, poet, sohrab, sepehri, on, the, other, hand, the, succinct, allusion, to, philosophical, truths, without, the, need, for, deliberation, the, non, judgmental, tone, of, the, poetic, voice, and, the, structure, of, the, poem, absence, of, personal, pronouns, adverbs, or, over, reliance, on, adjectives, as, well, as, the, lines, containing, a, kigo, a, season, word, gives, much, of, this, poetry, a, haikuesque, characteristic, kiarostami, s, three, volumes, of, original, verse, plus, his, selections, from, classical, and, contemporary,

cannot, describe, my, feelings, about, them, when, satyajit, ray, passed, on, i, was, very, depressed, but, after, seeing, kiarostami, s, films, i, thanked, god, for, giving, us, just, the, right, person, to, take, his, place, critically, acclaimed, directors, such, as, martin, scorsese, have, commented, that, kiarostami, represents, the, highest, level, of, artistry, in, the, cinema, the, austrian, director, michael, haneke, had, admired, the, work, of, abbas, kiarostami, as, among, the, best, of, any, living, director, in, 2006, the, guardian, s, panel, of, critics, ranked,

imagine, the, dialogue, and, circumstances, of, important, scenes, in, homework, and, close, up, parts, of, the, soundtrack, are, masked, or, silenced, critics, have, argued, that, the, subtlety, of, kiarostami, s, cinematic, expression, is, largely, resistant, to, critical, analysis, while, kiarostami, has, won, significant, acclaim, in, europe, for, several, of, his, films, the, iranian, government, has, refused, to, permit, the, screening, of, his, films, to, which, he, responded, the, government, has, decided, not, to, show, any, of, my, films, for, the, past, 10, years, i, think, they, don, t, understand, my, films, and, so, prevent, them, being, shown, just, in, case, there, is, a, message, they, don, t, want, to, get, out, in, the, wake, of, the, september, 11, attacks, kiarostami, was, refused, a, visa, to, attend, the, new, york, film, festival, the, festival, director, richard, pe, a, who, had, invited, him, said, it, s, a, terrible, sign, of, what, s, happening,
