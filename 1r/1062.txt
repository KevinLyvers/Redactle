military, services, and, reorganized, the, empire, s, provincial, divisions, establishing, the, largest, and, most, bureaucratic, government, in, the, history, of, the, empire, he, established, new, administrative, centers, in, nicomedia, mediolanum, sirmium, and, trevorum, closer, to, the, empire, s, frontiers, than, the, traditional, capital, at, rome, building, on, third, century, trends, towards, absolutism, he, styled, himself, an, autocrat, elevating, himself, above, the, empire, s, masses, with, imposing, forms, of, court, ceremonies, and, architecture, bureaucratic, and, military,

standardized, made, more, equitable, and, levied, at, generally, higher, rates, not, all, of, diocletian, s, plans, were, successful, the, edict, on, maximum, prices, 301, his, attempt, to, curb, inflation, via, price, controls, was, counterproductive, and, quickly, ignored, although, effective, while, he, ruled, diocletian, s, tetrarchic, system, collapsed, after, his, abdication, under, the, competing, dynastic, claims, of, maxentius, and, constantine, sons, of, maximian, and, constantius, respectively, the, diocletianic, persecution, 303, 312, the, empire, s, last, largest, and,

despite, these, failures, and, challenges, diocletian, s, reforms, fundamentally, changed, the, structure, of, the, roman, imperial, government, and, helped, stabilize, the, empire, economically, and, militarily, enabling, the, empire, to, remain, essentially, intact, for, another, 150, years, despite, being, near, the, brink, of, collapse, in, diocletian, s, youth, weakened, by, illness, diocletian, left, the, imperial, office, on, 1, may, 305, becoming, the, first, roman, emperor, to, abdicate, the, position, voluntarily, he, lived, out, his, retirement, in, his, palace, on, the, dalmatian, coast, tending, to, his, vegetable, gardens, his, palace, eventually, became, the, core, of, the, modern, day, city, of, split, in, croatia, diocletian, was, born, in, dalmatia, probably, at, or, near, the, town, of, salona, modern, solin, croatia, to, which, he, retired, later, in, life, his, original, name, was, diocles, in, full, gaius, valerius, diocles, possibly, derived, from, dioclea, the, name, of, both, his, mother, and, her, supposed, place, of, birth, diocletian, s, official, birthday, was, 22, december, and, his, year, of, birth, has, been, estimated, at, between, 242, and, 245, based, on, a, statement, that, he, was, aged, 68, at, death, alongside, other, evidence, his, parents, were, of, low, status, eutropius, records, that, he, is, said, by, most, writers, to, have, been, the, son, of, a, scribe, but, by, some, to, have, been, a, freedman, of, a, senator, called, anulinus, the, first, forty, years, of, his, life, are, mostly, obscure, diocletian, was, considered, an, illyricianus, illyrian, who, had, been, schooled, and, promoted, by, aurelian, the, 12th, century, byzantine, chronicler, joannes, zonaras, states, that, he, was, dux, moesiae, a, commander, of, forces, on, the, lower, danube, the, often, unreliable, historia, augusta, states, that, he, served, in, gaul, but, this, is, not, corroborated, by, other, sources, and, is, ignored, by, modern, historians, the, first, time, diocletian, s, whereabouts, are, accurately, established, was, in, 282, when, the, emperor, carus, made, him, commander, of, the, protectores, domestici, the, elite, cavalry, force, directly, attached, to, the, imperial, household, this, post, earned, him, the, honor, of, a, consulship, in, 283, carus, s, death, amid, a, successful, war, with, persia, and, in, mysterious, circumstances, he, was, believed, to, have, been, struck, by, lightning, or, killed, by, persian, soldiers, left, his, sons, numerian, and, carinus, as, the, new, augusti, carinus, quickly, made, his, way, to, rome, from, his, post, in, gaul, and, arrived, there, by, january, 284, becoming, the, legitimate, emperor, in, the, west, numerian, lingered, in, the, east, the, roman, withdrawal, from, persia, was, orderly, and, unopposed, the, sassanid, king, bahram, ii, could, not, field, an, army, against, them, as, he, was, still, struggling, to, establish, his, authority, by, march, 284, numerian, had, only, reached, emesa, homs, in, syria, by, november, only, asia, minor, in, emesa, he, was, apparently, still, alive, and, in, good, health, he, issued, the, only, extant, rescript, in, his, name, there, but, after, he, left, the, city, his, staff, including, the, prefect, numerian, s, father, in, law, and, the, dominant, influence, in, his, entourage, aper, reported, that, he, suffered, from, an, inflammation, of, the, eyes, he, traveled, in, a, closed, coach, from, then, on, when, the, army, reached, bithynia, some, of, the, soldiers, smelled, an, odor, emanating, from, the, coach, they, opened, its, curtains, and, found, numerian, dead, both, eutropius, and, aurelius, victor, describe, numerian, s, death, as, an, assassination, aper, officially, broke, the, news, in, nicomedia, zmit, in, november, numerian, s, generals, and, tribunes, called, a, council, for, the, succession, and, chose, diocles, as, emperor, in, spite, of, aper, s, attempts, to, garner, support, on, 20, november, 284, the, army, of, the, east, gathered, on, a, hill, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, outside, nicomedia, the, army, unanimously, saluted, diocles, as, their, new, augustus, and, he, accepted, the, purple, imperial, vestments, he, raised, his, sword, to, the, light, of, the, sun, and, swore, an, oath, disclaiming, responsibility, for, numerian, s, death, he, asserted, that, aper, had, killed, numerian, and, concealed, it, in, full, view, of, the, army, diocles, drew, his, sword, and, killed, aper, soon, after, aper, s, death, diocles, changed, his, name, to, the, more, latinate, diocletianus, in, full, gaius, valerius, diocletianus, after, his, accession, diocletian, and, lucius, caesonius, bassus, were, named, as, consuls, and, assumed, the, fasces, in, place, of, carinus, and, numerian, bassus, was, a, member, of, a, senatorial, family, from, campania, a, former, consul, and, proconsul, of, africa, chosen, by, probus, for, signal, distinction, he, was, skilled, in, areas, of, government, where, diocletian, presumably, had, no, experience, diocletian, s, elevation, of, bassus, symbolized, his, rejection, of, carinus, government, in, rome, his, refusal, to, accept, second, tier, status, to, any, other, emperor, and, his, willingness, to, continue, the, long, standing, collaboration, between, the, empire, s, senatorial, and, military, aristocracies, it, also, tied, his, success, to, that, of, the, senate, whose, support, he, would, need, in, his, advance, on, rome, diocletian, was, not, the, only, challenger, to, carinus, rule, the, usurper, julianus, carinus, corrector, venetiae, took, control, of, northern, italy, and, pannonia, after, diocletian, s, accession, julianus, minted, coins, from, siscia, sisak, croatia, declaring, himself, emperor, and, promising, freedom, this, aided, diocletian, in, his, portrayal, of, carinus, as, a, cruel, and, oppressive, tyrant, julianus, forces, were, weak, and, were, handily, dispersed, when, carinus, armies, moved, from, britain, to, northern, italy, as, the, leader, of, the, united, east, diocletian, was, clearly, the, greater, threat, over, the, winter, of, 284, 85, diocletian, advanced, west, across, the, balkans, in, the, spring, some, time, before, the, end, of, may, his, armies, met, carinus, across, the, river, margus, great, morava, in, moesia, in, modern, accounts, the, site, has, been, located, between, the, mons, aureus, seone, west, of, smederevo, and, viminacium, near, modern, belgrade, serbia, despite, having, a, stronger, more, powerful, army, carinus, held, the, weaker, position, his, rule, was, unpopular, and, it, was, later, alleged, that, he, had, mistreated, the, senate, and, seduced, his, officers, wives, it, is, possible, that, flavius, constantius, the, governor, of, dalmatia, and, diocletian, s, associate, in, the, household, guard, had, already, defected, to, diocletian, in, the, early, spring, when, the, battle, of, the, margus, began, carinus, prefect, aristobulus, also, defected, in, the, course, of, the, battle, carinus, was, killed, by, his, own, men, following, diocletian, s, victory, both, the, western, and, the, eastern, armies, acclaimed, him, as, emperor, diocletian, exacted, an, oath, of, allegiance, from, the, defeated, army, and, departed, for, italy, diocletian, may, have, become, involved, in, battles, against, the, quadi, and, marcomanni, immediately, after, the, battle, of, the, margus, he, eventually, made, his, way, to, northern, italy, and, made, an, imperial, government, but, it, is, not, known, whether, he, visited, rome, at, this, time, there, is, a, contemporary, issue, of, coins, suggestive, of, an, imperial, adventus, arrival, for, the, city, but, some, modern, historians, state, that, diocletian, avoided, the, city, to, demonstrate, that, the, city, and, its, senate, were, no, longer, politically, relevant, to, the, affairs, of, the, empire, diocletian, dated, his, reign, from, his, elevation, by, the, army, not, his, ratification, by, the, senate, following, the, practice, established, by, carus, who, had, declared, the, senate, s, ratification, a, useless, formality, however, diocletian, offered, proof, of, his, deference, towards, the, senate, by, retaining, aristobulus, as, ordinary, consul, and, colleague, for, 285, one, of, the, few, instances, during, the, late, empire, in, which, an, emperor, admitted, a, privatus, as, his, colleague, and, by, creating, senior, senators, vettius, aquilinus, and, junius, maximus, ordinary, consuls, for, the, following, year, for, maximus, it, was, his, second, consulship, if, diocletian, did, enter, rome, shortly, after, his, accession, he, did, not, stay, long, he, is, attested, back, in, the, balkans, by, 2, november, 285, on, campaign, against, the, sarmatians, diocletian, replaced, the, prefect, of, rome, with, his, consular, colleague, bassus, most, officials, who, had, served, under, carinus, however, retained, their, offices, under, diocletian, in, an, act, of, clementia, denoted, by, the, epitomator, of, aurelius, victor, as, unusual, diocletian, did, not, kill, or, depose, carinus, s, traitorous, praetorian, prefect, and, consul, aristobulus, but, confirmed, him, in, both, roles, he, later, gave, him, the, proconsulate, of, africa, and, the, post, of, urban, prefect, for, 295, the, other, figures, who, retained, their, offices, might, have, also, betrayed, carinus, the, assassinations, of, aurelian, and, probus, demonstrated, that, sole, rulership, was, dangerous, to, the, stability, of, the, empire, conflict, boiled, in, every, province, from, gaul, to, syria, egypt, to, the, lower, danube, it, was, too, much, for, one, person, to, control, and, diocletian, needed, a, lieutenant, according, to, eutropius, diocletian, raised, his, fellow, officer, maximian, to, the, office, of, caesar, making, him, his, heir, and, effective, co, ruler, the, concept, of, dual, rulership, was, not, new, to, the, roman, empire, augustus, the, first, emperor, had, nominally, shared, power, with, his, colleagues, and, a, formal, office, of, co, emperor, co, augustus, had, existed, from, marcus, aurelius, onward, most, recently, emperor, carus, and, his, sons, had, ruled, together, albeit, unsuccessfully, diocletian, was, in, a, less, comfortable, position, than, most, of, his, predecessors, as, he, had, a, daughter, valeria, but, no, sons, his, co, ruler, had, to, be, from, outside, his, family, raising, the, question, of, trust, some, historians, state, that, diocletian, adopted, maximian, as, his, filius, augusti, his, augustan, son, upon, his, appointment, to, the, throne, following, the, precedent, of, some, previous, emperors, this, argument, has, not, been, universally, accepted, diocletian, and, maximian, added, each, other, s, nomina, their, family, name, valerius, and, aurelius, respectively, to, their, own, thus, creating, an, artificial, family, link, and, becoming, part, of, the, aurelius, valerius, family, the, relationship, between, diocletian, and, maximian, was, quickly, couched, in, religious, terms, around, 287, diocletian, assumed, the, title, iovius, jovius, and, maximian, assumed, the, title, herculius, hercules, the, titles, were, probably, meant, to, convey, certain, characteristics, of, their, associated, leaders, diocletian, in, jovian, style, would, take, on, the, dominating, roles, of, planning, and, commanding, maximian, in, herculian, mode, would, act, as, jupiter, s, heroic, subordinate, for, all, their, religious, connotations, the, emperors, were, not, gods, in, the, tradition, of, the, imperial, cult, although, they, may, have, been, hailed, as, such, in, imperial, panegyrics, instead, they, were, seen, as, the, gods, representatives, effecting, their, will, on, earth, the, shift, from, military, acclamation, to, divine, sanctification, took, the, power, to, appoint, emperors, away, from, the, army, religious, legitimization, elevated, diocletian, and, maximian, above, potential, rivals, in, a, way, military, power, and, dynastic, claims, could, not, after, his, acclamation, maximian, was, dispatched, to, fight, the, rebel, bagaudae, insurgent, peasants, of, gaul, diocletian, returned, to, the, east, progressing, slowly, by, 2, november, he, had, only, reached, civitas, iovia, botivo, near, ptuj, slovenia, in, the, balkans, during, the, autumn, of, 285, he, encountered, a, tribe, of, sarmatians, who, demanded, assistance, the, sarmatians, requested, that, diocletian, either, help, them, recover, their, lost, lands, or, grant, them, pasturage, rights, within, the, empire, diocletian, refused, and, fought, a, battle, with, them, but, was, unable, to, secure, a, complete, victory, the, nomadic, pressures, of, the, european, plain, remained, and, could, not, be, solved, by, a, single, war, soon, the, sarmatians, would, have, to, be, fought, again, diocletian, wintered, in, nicomedia, there, may, have, been, a, revolt, in, the, eastern, provinces, at, this, time, as, he, brought, settlers, from, asia, to, populate, emptied, farmlands, in, thrace, he, visited, syria, palaestina, the, following, spring, his, stay, in, the, east, saw, diplomatic, success, in, the, conflict, with, persia, in, 287, bahram, ii, granted, him, precious, gifts, declared, open, friendship, with, the, empire, and, invited, diocletian, to, visit, him, roman, sources, insist, that, the, act, was, entirely, voluntary, around, the, same, time, perhaps, in, 287, persia, relinquished, claims, on, armenia, and, recognized, roman, authority, over, territory, to, the, west, and, south, of, the, tigris, the, western, portion, of, armenia, was, incorporated, into, the, empire, and, made, a, province, tiridates, iii, the, arsacid, claimant, to, the, armenian, throne, and, a, roman, client, had, been, disinherited, and, forced, to, take, refuge, in, the, empire, after, the, persian, conquest, of, 252, 53, in, 287, he, returned, to, lay, claim, to, the, eastern, half, of, his, ancestral, domain, and, encountered, no, opposition, bahram, ii, s, gifts, were, widely, recognized, as, symbolic, of, a, victory, in, the, ongoing, conflict, with, persia, and, diocletian, was, hailed, as, the, founder, of, eternal, peace, the, events, might, have, represented, a, formal, end, to, carus, s, eastern, campaign, which, probably, ended, without, an, acknowledged, peace, at, the, conclusion, of, discussions, with, the, persians, diocletian, re, organized, the, mesopotamian, frontier, and, fortified, the, city, of, circesium, buseire, syria, on, the, euphrates, maximian, s, campaigns, were, not, proceeding, as, smoothly, the, bagaudae, had, been, easily, suppressed, but, carausius, the, man, he, had, put, in, charge, of, operations, against, saxon, and, frankish, pirates, on, the, saxon, shore, had, according, to, literary, sources, begun, keeping, the, goods, seized, from, the, pirates, for, himself, maximian, issued, a, death, warrant, for, his, larcenous, subordinate, carausius, fled, the, continent, proclaimed, himself, emperor, and, agitated, britain, and, northwestern, gaul, into, open, revolt, against, maximian, and, diocletian, far, more, probable, according, to, the, archaeological, evidence, is, that, carausius, had, held, some, important, military, post, in, britain, already, had, a, firm, basis, of, power, in, britain, and, northern, gaul, and, profited, from, the, lack, of, legitimacy, of, the, central, government, carausius, strove, to, have, his, legitimacy, as, a, junior, emperor, acknowledged, by, diocletian, in, his, coinage, he, extolled, the, concord, between, him, and, the, central, power, one, bronze, piece, from, 290, read, pax, avggg, the, peace, of, the, three, augusti, on, the, other, side, it, showed, carausius, together, with, diocletian, and, maximian, with, the, caption, caravsivs, et, fratres, svi, carausius, his, brothers, however, diocletian, could, not, allow, a, breakaway, regional, usurper, following, in, postumus, s, footprints, to, enter, of, his, own, accord, the, imperial, college, spurred, by, the, crisis, on, 1, april, 286, maximian, took, up, the, title, of, augustus, emperor, unusually, diocletian, could, not, have, been, present, to, witness, it, it, has, even, been, suggested, that, maximian, usurped, the, title, and, was, only, later, recognized, by, diocletian, in, hopes, of, avoiding, civil, war, this, suggestion, is, unpopular, as, it, is, clear, that, diocletian, meant, for, maximian, to, act, with, a, certain, amount, of, independence, it, may, be, posited, that, diocletian, felt, the, need, to, bind, maximian, closer, to, him, by, making, him, his, empowered, associate, to, avoid, the, possibility, of, him, striking, some, sort, of, deal, with, carausius, maximian, realized, that, he, could, not, immediately, suppress, the, rogue, commander, so, in, 287, he, campaigned, against, tribes, beyond, the, rhine, instead, as, carausius, was, allied, to, the, franks, maximian, s, campaigns, could, be, seen, as, an, effort, to, deny, him, a, basis, of, support, on, the, mainland, the, following, spring, as, maximian, prepared, a, fleet, for, an, expedition, against, carausius, diocletian, returned, from, the, east, to, meet, maximian, the, two, emperors, agreed, on, a, joint, campaign, against, the, alamanni, diocletian, invaded, germania, through, raetia, while, maximian, progressed, from, mainz, each, burned, crops, and, food, supplies, as, he, went, destroying, the, germans, means, of, sustenance, the, two, men, added, territory, to, the, empire, and, allowed, maximian, to, continue, preparations, against, carausius, without, further, disturbance, on, his, return, to, the, east, diocletian, managed, what, was, probably, another, rapid, campaign, against, the, resurgent, sarmatians, no, details, survive, but, surviving, inscriptions, indicate, that, diocletian, took, the, title, sarmaticus, maximus, after, 289, in, the, east, diocletian, engaged, in, diplomacy, with, desert, tribes, in, the, regions, between, rome, and, persia, he, might, have, been, attempting, to, persuade, them, to, ally, themselves, with, rome, thus, reviving, the, old, rome, friendly, palmyrene, sphere, of, influence, or, to, reduce, the, frequency, of, their, incursions, no, details, survive, for, these, events, some, of, the, princes, of, these, states, were, persian, client, kings, a, disturbing, fact, for, the, romans, in, light, of, increasing, tensions, with, the, sassanids, in, the, west, maximian, lost, the, fleet, built, in, 288, and, 289, probably, in, the, early, spring, of, 290, the, panegyrist, who, refers, to, the, loss, suggests, that, its, cause, was, a, storm, but, this, might, have, been, an, attempt, to, conceal, an, embarrassing, military, defeat, diocletian, broke, off, his, tour, of, the, eastern, provinces, soon, thereafter, he, returned, with, haste, to, the, west, reaching, emesa, by, 10, may, 290, and, sirmium, on, the, danube, by, 1, july, 290, diocletian, met, maximian, in, milan, either, in, late, december, 290, or, january, 291, the, meeting, was, undertaken, with, a, sense, of, solemn, pageantry, the, emperors, spent, most, of, their, time, in, public, appearances, it, has, been, surmised, that, the, ceremonies, were, arranged, to, demonstrate, diocletian, s, continuing, support, for, his, faltering, colleague, a, deputation, from, the, roman, senate, met, with, the, emperors, renewing, its, infrequent, contact, with, the, imperial, office, the, choice, of, milan, over, rome, further, snubbed, the, capital, s, pride, but, then, it, was, already, a, long, established, practice, that, rome, itself, was, only, a, ceremonial, capital, as, the, actual, seat, of, the, imperial, administration, was, determined, by, the, needs, of, defense, long, before, diocletian, gallienus, r, 253, 68, had, chosen, milan, for, his, headquarters, if, the, panegyric, detailing, the, ceremony, implied, that, the, true, center, of, the, empire, was, not, rome, but, where, the, emperor, sat, the, capital, of, the, empire, appeared, to, be, there, where, the, two, emperors, met, it, simply, echoed, what, had, already, been, stated, by, the, historian, herodian, in, the, early, third, century, rome, is, where, the, emperor, is, during, the, meeting, decisions, on, matters, of, politics, and, war, were, probably, made, in, secret, the, augusti, would, not, meet, again, until, 303, some, time, after, his, return, and, before, 293, diocletian, transferred, command, of, the, war, against, carausius, from, maximian, to, flavius, constantius, which, he, concluded, successfully, in, 296, constantius, was, a, former, governor, of, dalmatia, and, a, man, of, military, experience, stretching, back, to, aurelian, s, campaigns, against, zenobia, 272, 73, he, was, maximian, s, praetorian, prefect, in, gaul, and, the, husband, to, maximian, s, daughter, theodora, on, 1, march, 293, at, milan, maximian, gave, constantius, the, office, of, caesar, the,

constantius, as, sons, these, relationships, implied, a, line, of, succession, galerius, and, constantius, would, become, augusti, after, the, departure, of, diocletian, and, maximian, maximian, s,

victoriously, on, the, danube, by, the, end, of, his, reign, diocletian, had, secured, the, entire, length, of, the, danube, provided, it, with, forts, bridgeheads, highways, and, walled, towns, and, sent, fifteen, or, more, legions, to, patrol, the, region, an, inscription, at, sexaginta, prista, on, the, lower, danube, extolled, restored, tranquility, to, the, region, the, defense, came, at, a, heavy, cost, but, was, a, significant, achievement, in, an, area, difficult, to, defend, galerius, meanwhile, was, engaged, during, 291, 293, in, disputes, in, upper, egypt, where, he, suppressed, a, regional, uprising, he, returned, to, syria, in, 295, to, fight, the, revanchist, persian, empire, diocletian, s, attempts, to, bring, the, egyptian, tax, system, in, line, with, imperial, standards,

including, alexandria, recognized, his, rule, diocletian, moved, into, egypt, to, suppress, him, first, putting, down, rebels, in, the, thebaid, in, the, autumn, of, 297, then, moving, on, to, besiege, alexandria, domitianus, died, in, december, 297, by, which, time, diocletian, had, secured, control, of, the, egyptian, countryside, alexandria, whose, defense, was, organized, under, domitianus, s, former, corrector, aurelius, achilleus, held, out, probably, until, march, 298, later, in, 298, a, triumphal, column, was, erected, in, alexandria, to, honor, diocletian, known, as,

succession, came, to, power, in, persia, in, early, 294, narseh, sent, diocletian, the, customary, package, of, gifts, between, the, empires, and, diocletian, responded, with, an, exchange, of, ambassadors, within, persia, narseh, was, destroying, every, trace, of, his, immediate, predecessors, from, public, monuments, he, sought, to, identify, himself, with, the, warlike, kings, ardashir, i, r, 226, 241, and, shapur, i, r, 241, 272, who, had, defeated, and, imprisoned, emperor, valerian, r, 253, 260, following, his, failed, invasion, of, the, sasanian, empire, narseh, declared, war, on, rome, in, 295, or, 296, he, appears, to, have, first, invaded, western, armenia, where, he, seized, the, lands, delivered, to, tiridates, in, the, peace, of, 287, he, moved, south, into, roman, mesopotamia, in, 297, where, he, inflicted, a, severe, defeat, on, galerius, in, the, region, between, carrhae, harran, turkey, and, callinicum, raqqa, syria, suggested, by, the, historian, fergus, millar, to, have, been, somewhere, on, the, balikh, river, diocletian, may, or, may, not, have, been, present, at, the, battle, but, he, quickly, divested, himself, of, all, responsibility, in, a, public, ceremony, at, antioch, the, official, version, of, events, was, clear, galerius, was, responsible, for, the, defeat, diocletian, was, not, diocletian, publicly, humiliated, galerius, forcing, him, to, walk, for, a, mile, at, the, head, of, the, imperial, caravan, still, clad, in, the, purple, robes, of, the, emperor, galerius, was, reinforced, probably, in, the, spring, of, 298, by, a, new, contingent, collected, from, the, empire, s, danubian, holdings, narseh, did, not, advance, from, armenia, and, mesopotamia, leaving, galerius, to, lead, the, offensive, in, 298, with, an, attack, on, northern, mesopotamia, via, armenia, it, is, unclear, if, diocletian, was, present, to, assist, the, campaign, he, might, have, returned, to, egypt, or, syria, narseh, retreated, to, armenia, to, fight, galerius, s, force, to, narseh, s, disadvantage, the, rugged, armenian, terrain, was, favorable, to, roman, infantry, but, not, to, sassanid, cavalry, in, two, battles, galerius,

led, to, a, wide, diffusion, of, syriac, christianity, from, a, center, at, nisibis, in, later, decades, and, the, eventual, christianization, of, armenia, to, strengthen, the, defence, of, the, east, diocletian, had, a, fortified, road, constructed, at, the, southern, border, where, the, empire, bordered, the, arabs, in, the, year, 300, this, road, would, remain, in, use, for, centuries, but, proved, ineffective, in, defending, the, border, as, conventional, armies, could, not, operate, in, the, region, at, the, conclusion, of, the, peace, of, nisibis, diocletian, and, galerius, returned, to, antioch, at, some, time, in, 299, the, emperors, took, part, in, a, ceremony, of, sacrifice, and, divination, in, an, attempt, to, predict, the, future, the, haruspices, were, unable, to, read, the, entrails, of, the, sacrificed, animals, and, blamed, christians, in, the, imperial, household, the, emperors, ordered, all, members, of, the, court, to, perform, a, sacrifice, to, purify, the,

religion, faithful, to, the, traditional, roman, pantheon, and, understanding, of, demands, for, religious, purification, but, eusebius, lactantius, and, constantine, state, that, it, was, galerius, not, diocletian, who, was, the, prime, supporter, of, the, purge, galerius, even, more, devoted, and, passionate, than, diocletian, saw, political, advantage, in, the, persecution, he, was, willing, to, break, with, a, government, policy, of, inaction, on, the, issue, antioch, was, diocletian, s, primary, residence, from, 299, to, 302, while, galerius, swapped, places, with, his, augustus, on, the, middle, and, lower, danube, diocletian, visited, egypt, once, over, the, winter, of, 301, 2, and, issued, a, grain, dole, in, alexandria, following, some, public, disputes, with, manicheans, diocletian, ordered, that, the, leading, followers, of, mani, be, burnt, alive, along, with, their, scriptures, in, a, 31, march, 302, rescript, from, alexandria, he, declared, that, low, status, manicheans, must, be, executed, by, the, blade, and, high, status, manicheans, must, be, sent, to, work, in, the, quarries, of, proconnesus, marmara, island, turkey, or, the, mines, of, phaeno, in, southern, palestine, all, manichean, property, was, to, be, seized, and, deposited, in, the, imperial, treasury, diocletian, found, much, to, be, offended, by, in, manichean, religion, its, novelty, its, alien, origins, its, perceived, corruption, of, roman, morals, and, its, inherent, opposition, to, long, standing, religious, traditions, his, reasons, for, opposing, manichaeanism, were, also, applied, to, his, next, target, christianity, diocletian, returned, to, antioch, in, the, autumn, of, 302, he, ordered, that, the, deacon, romanus, of, caesarea, have, his, tongue, removed, for, defying, the, order, of, the, courts, and, interrupting, official, sacrifices, romanus, was, then, sent, to, prison, where, he, was, executed, on, 17, november, 303, diocletian, left, the, city, for, nicomedia, in, the, winter, accompanied, by, galerius, according, to, lactantius, diocletian, and, galerius, argued, over, imperial, policy, towards, christians, while, wintering, at, nicomedia, in, 302, diocletian, believed, that, forbidding, christians, from, the, bureaucracy, and, military, would, be, sufficient, to, appease, the, gods, but, galerius, pushed, for, extermination, the, two, men, sought, the, advice, of, the, oracle, of, apollo, at, didyma, the, oracle, responded, that, the, impious, on, earth, hindered, apollo, s, ability, to, provide, advice, rhetorically, eusebius, records, the, oracle, as, saying, the, just, on, earth, these, impious, diocletian, was, informed, by, members, of, the, court, could, only, refer, to, the, christians, of, the, empire, at, the, behest, of, his, court, diocletian, acceded, to, demands, for, universal, persecution, on, 23, february, 303, diocletian, ordered, that, the, newly, built, church, at, nicomedia, be, razed, he, demanded, that, its, scriptures, be, burned, and, seized, its, precious, stores, for, the, treasury, the, next, day, diocletian, s, first, edict, against, the, christians, was, published, the, edict, ordered, the, destruction, of, christian, scriptures, and, places, of, worship, across, the, empire, and, prohibited, christians, from, assembling, for, worship, before, the, end, of, february, a, fire, destroyed, part, of, the, imperial, palace, galerius, convinced, diocletian, that, the, culprits, were, christians, conspirators, who, had, plotted, with, the, eunuchs, of, the, palace, an, investigation, was, commissioned, but, no, responsible, party, was, found, executions, followed, anyway, and, the, palace, eunuchs, dorotheus, and, gorgonius, were, executed, one, individual, peter, cubicularius, was, stripped, raised, high, and, scourged, salt, and, vinegar, were, poured, in, his, wounds, and, he, was, slowly, boiled, over, an, open, flame, the, executions, continued, until, at, least, 24, april, 303, when, six, individuals, including, the, bishop, anthimus, were, decapitated, a, second, fire, occurred, sixteen, days, after, the, first, galerius, left, the, city, for, rome, declaring, nicomedia, unsafe, diocletian, would, soon, follow, although, further, persecutory, edicts, followed, compelling, the, arrest, of, the, christian, clergy, and, universal, acts, of, sacrifice, they, were, ultimately, unsuccessful, most, christians, escaped, punishment, and, pagans, too, were, generally, unsympathetic, to, the, persecution, the, martyrs, sufferings, strengthened, the, resolve, of, their, fellow, christians, constantius, and, maximian, did, not, apply, the, later, edicts, and, left, the, christians, of, the, west, unharmed, galerius, rescinded, the, edict, in, 311, announcing, that, the, persecution, had, failed, to, bring, christians, back, to, traditional, religion, the, temporary, apostasy, of, some, christians, and, the, surrendering, of, scriptures, during, the, persecution, played, a, major, role, in, the, subsequent, donatist, controversy, within, twenty, five, years, of, the, persecution, s, inauguration, the, christian, emperor, constantine, would, rule, the, empire, alone, he, would, reverse, the, consequences, of, the, edicts, and, return, all, confiscated, property, to, christians, under, constantine, s, rule, christianity, would, become, the, empire, s, preferred, religion, diocletian, was, demonized, by, his, christian, successors, lactantius, intimated, that, diocletian, s, ascendancy, heralded, the, apocalypse, diocletian, entered, the, city, of, rome, in, the, early, winter, of, 303, on, 20, november, he, celebrated, with, maximian, the, twentieth, anniversary, of, his, reign, vicennalia, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, tetrarchy, decennalia, and, a, triumph, for, the, war, with, persia, diocletian, soon, grew, impatient, with, the, city, as, the, romans, acted, towards, him, with, what, edward, gibbon, following, lactantius, calls, licentious, familiarity, the, roman, people, did, not, give, enough, deference, to, his, supreme, authority, it, expected, him, to, act, the, part, of, an, aristocratic, ruler, not, a, monarchic, one, on, 20, december, 303, diocletian, cut, short, his, stay, in, rome, and, left, for, the, north, he, did, not, even, perform, the, ceremonies, investing, him, with, his, ninth, consulate, he, did, them, in, ravenna, on, 1, january, 304, instead, there, are, suggestions, in, the, panegyrici, latini, and, lactantius, s, account, that, diocletian, arranged, plans, for, his, and, maximian, s, future, retirement, of, power, in, rome, maximian, according, to, these, accounts, swore, to, uphold, diocletian, s, plan, in, a, ceremony, in, the, temple, of, jupiter, from, ravenna, diocletian, left, for, the, danube, there, possibly, in, galerius, s, company, he, took, part, in, a, campaign, against, the, carpi, he, contracted, a, minor, illness, while, on, campaign, but, his, condition, quickly, worsened, and, he, chose, to, travel, in, a, litter, in, the, late, summer, he, left, for, nicomedia, on, 20, november, 304, he, appeared, in, public, to, dedicate, the, opening, of, the, circus, beside, his, palace, he, collapsed, soon, after, the, ceremonies, over, the, winter, of, 304, 05, he, kept, within, his, palace, at, all, times, rumors, that, diocletian, s, death, was, being, kept, secret, until, galerius, could, assume, power, spread, through, the, city, on, 13, december, it, was, falsely, announced, that, diocletian, had, killed, himself, the, city, was, sent, into, mourning, from, which, it, recovered, after, public, declarations, that, diocletian, was, still, alive, when, diocletian, reappeared, in, public, on, 1, march, 305, he, was, emaciated, and, barely, recognizable, galerius, arrived, in, the, city, later, in, march, according, to, lactantius, he, came, armed, with, plans, to, reconstitute, the, tetrarchy, force, diocletian, to, step, down, and, fill, the, imperial, office, with, men, compliant, to, his, will, through, coercion, and, threats, he, eventually, convinced, diocletian, to, comply, with, his, plan, lactantius, also, claims, that, he, had, done, the, same, to, maximian, at, sirmium, scholars, doubt, lactantius, account, since, he, had, a, strong, bias, against, galerius, and, probably, attempted, to, villainize, him, on, 1, may, 305, diocletian, called, an, assembly, of, his, generals, traditional, companion, troops, and, representatives, from, distant, legions, they, met, at, the, same, hill, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, out, of, nicomedia, where, diocletian, had, been, proclaimed, emperor, in, front, of, a, statue, of, jupiter, his, patron, deity, diocletian, addressed, the, crowd, with, tears, in, his, eyes, he, told, them, of, his, weakness, his, need, for, rest, and, his, will, to, resign, he, declared, that, he, needed, to, pass, the, duty, of, empire, on, to, someone, stronger, he, thus, became, the, first, and, arguably, only, roman, emperor, to, voluntarily, abdicate, his, title, most, in, the, crowd, believed, that, constantine, and, maxentius, the, only, adult, sons, of, reigning, emperors, who, had, long, been, preparing, to, succeed, their, fathers, would, be, granted, the, title, of, caesar, constantine, had, travelled, through, palestine, at, the, right, hand, of, diocletian, and, was, present, at, the, palace, in, nicomedia, in, 303, and, 305, it, is, likely, that, maxentius, received, the, same, treatment, in, lactantius, s, account, when, diocletian, announced, that, he, was, to, resign, the, entire, crowd, turned, to, face, constantine, it, was, not, to, be, severus, ii, and, maximinus, ii, were, declared, caesars, maximinus, appeared, and, took, diocletian, s, robes, on, the, same, day, severus, received, his, robes, from, maximian, in, milan, constantius, succeeded, maximian, as, augustus, of, the, west, but, constantine, and, maxentius, were, entirely, ignored, in, the, transition, of, power, this, did, not, bode, well, for, the, future, security, of, the, tetrarchic, system, diocletian, retired, to, his, homeland, dalmatia, he, moved, into, the, expansive, diocletian, s, palace, a, heavily, fortified, compound, located, by, the, small, town, of, spalatum, on, the, shores, of, the, adriatic, sea, and, near, the, large, provincial, administrative, center, of, salona, the, palace, is, preserved, in, great, part, to, this, day, and, forms, the, historic, core, of, split, modern, day, croatia, where, it, was, designated, a, world, heritage, site, by, unesco, in, 1979, maximian, retired, to, villas, in, campania, or, lucania, their, homes, were, distant, from, political, life, but, diocletian, and, maximian, were, close, enough, to, remain, in, regular, contact, with, each, other, galerius, assumed, the, consular, fasces, in, 308, with, diocletian, as, his, colleague, in, the, autumn, of, 308, galerius, again, conferred, with, diocletian, at, carnuntum, petronell, carnuntum, austria, diocletian, and, maximian, were, both, present, on, 11, november, 308, to, see, galerius, appoint, licinius, to, be, augustus, in, place, of, severus, who, had, died, at, the, hands, of, maxentius, he, ordered, maximian, who, had, attempted, to, return, to, power, after, his, retirement, to, step, down, permanently, at, carnuntum, people, begged, diocletian, to, return, to, the, throne, to, resolve, the, conflicts, that, had, arisen, through, constantine, s, rise, to, power, and, maxentius, s, usurpation, diocletian, s, reply, if, you, could, show, the, cabbage, that, i, planted, with, my, own, hands, to, your, emperor, he, definitely, wouldn, t, dare, suggest, that, i, replace, the, peace, and, happiness, of, this, place, with, the, storms, of, a, never, satisfied, greed, diocletian, lived, for, four, more, years, spending, his, days, in, his, palace, gardens, he, saw, his, tetrarchic, system, fail, torn, apart, by, the, civil, wars, of, his, successors, he, heard, of, maximian, s, third, claim, to, the, throne, his, forced, suicide, and, his, damnatio, memoriae, in, his, own, palace, statues, and, portraits, of, his, former, companion, emperor, were, torn, down, and, destroyed, after, an, illness, diocletian, died, on, 3, december, 311, with, some, proposing, that, he, took, his, own, life, in, despair, diocletian, saw, his, work, as, that, of, a, restorer, a, figure, of, authority, whose, duty, it, was, to, return, the, empire, to, peace, to, recreate, stability, and, justice, where, barbarian, hordes, had, destroyed, it, he, arrogated, regimented, and, centralized, political, authority, on, a, massive, scale, in, his, policies, he, enforced, an, imperial, system, of, values, on, diverse, and, often, unreceptive, provincial, audiences, in, the, imperial, propaganda, from, the, period, recent, history, was, perverted, and, minimized, in, the, service, of, the, theme, of, the, tetrarchs, as, restorers, aurelian, s, achievements, were, ignored, the, revolt, of, carausius, was, backdated, to, the, reign, of, gallienus, and, it, was, implied, that, the, tetrarchs, engineered, aurelian, s, defeat, of, the, palmyrenes, the, period, between, gallienus, and, diocletian, was, effectively, erased, the, history, of, the, empire, before, the, tetrarchy, was, portrayed, as, a, time, of, civil, war, savage, despotism, and, imperial, collapse, in, those, inscriptions, that, bear, their, names, diocletian, the, founder, of, eternal, peace, and, his, companions, are, referred, to, as, restorers, of, the, whole, world, men, who, succeeded, in, defeating, the, nations, of, the, barbarians, and, confirming, the, tranquility, of, their, world, the, theme, of, restoration, was, conjoined, to, an, emphasis, on, the, uniqueness, and, accomplishments, of, the, tetrarchs, themselves, the, cities, where, emperors, lived, frequently, in, this, period, milan, trier, arles, sirmium, serdica, thessaloniki, nicomedia, and, antioch, were, treated, as, alternate, imperial, seats, to, the, exclusion, of, rome, and, its, senatorial, elite, a, new, style, of, ceremony, was, developed, emphasizing, the, distinction, of, the, emperor, from, all, other, persons, the, quasi, republican, ideals, of, augustus, s, primus, inter, pares, were, abandoned, for, all, but, the, tetrarchs, themselves, diocletian, took, to, wearing, a, gold, crown, and, jewels, and, forbade, the, use, of, purple, cloth, to, all, but, the, emperors, his, subjects, were, required, to, prostrate, themselves, in, his, presence, adoratio, the, most, fortunate, were, allowed, the, privilege, of, kissing, the, hem, of, his, robe, proskynesis, circuses, and, basilicas, were, designed, to, keep, the, face, of, the, emperor, perpetually, in, view, and, always, in, a, seat, of, authority, the, emperor, became, a, figure, of, transcendent, authority, a, man, beyond, the, grip, of, the, masses, his, every, appearance, was, stage, managed, this, style, of, presentation, was, not, new, many, of, its, elements, were, first, seen, in, the, reigns, of, aurelian, and, severus, but, it, was, only, under, the, tetrarchs, that, it, was, refined, into, an, explicit, system, in, keeping, with, his, move, from, an, ideology, of, republicanism, to, one, of, autocracy, diocletian, s, council, of, advisers, his, consilium, differed, from, those, of, earlier, emperors, he, destroyed, the, augustan, illusion, of, imperial, government, as, a, cooperative, affair, among, emperor, army, and, senate, in, its, place, he, established, an, effectively, autocratic, structure, a, shift, later, epitomized, in, the, institution, s, name, it, would, be, called, a, consistorium, not, a, council, diocletian, regulated, his, court, by, distinguishing, separate, departments, scrinia, for, different, tasks, from, this, structure, came, the, offices, of, different, magistri, like, the, magister, officiorum, master, of, offices, and, associated, secretariats, these, were, men, suited, to, dealing, with, petitions, requests, correspondence, legal, affairs, and, foreign, embassies, within, his, court, diocletian, maintained, a, permanent, body, of, legal, advisers, men, with, significant, influence, on, his, re, ordering, of, juridical, affairs, there, were, also, two, finance, ministers, dealing, with, the, separate, bodies, of, the, public, treasury, and, the, private, domains, of, the, emperor, and, the, praetorian, prefect, the, most, significant, person, of, the, whole, diocletian, s, reduction, of, the, praetorian, guards, to, the, level, of, a, simple, city, garrison, for, rome, lessened, the, military, powers, of, the, prefect, although, a, prefect, like, asclepiodotus, was, still, a, trained, general, but, the, office, retained, much, civil, authority, the, prefect, kept, a, staff, of, hundreds, and, managed, affairs, in, all, segments, of, government, in, taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and, minor, military, commands, the, praetorian, prefect, was, often, second, only, to, the, emperor, himself, altogether, diocletian, greatly, increased, the, number, of, bureaucrats, at, the, government, s, command, lactantius, claimed, that, there, were, now, more, men, using, tax, money, than, there, were, paying, it, the, historian, warren, treadgold, estimates, that, under, diocletian, the, number, of, men, in, the, civil, service, doubled, from, 15, 000, to, 30, 000, the, classicist, roger, s, bagnall, estimates, that, there, was, one, bureaucrat, for, every, 5, 10, 000, people, in, egypt, based, on, 400, or, 800, bureaucrats, for, 4, million, inhabitants, jones, estimated, 30, 000, bureaucrats, which, he, remarks, is, not, an, extravagant, number, given, the, size, of, the, empire, he, breaks, down, the, bureaucracy, as, less, than, 12, 000, provincial, officials, and, roughly, 6, 000, diocesan, officials, for, the, military, he, estimates, a, modest, 300, officials, per, magister, militum, and, 40, per, dux, for, a, total, of, about, 5, 000, military, officials, for, the, praetorian, prefect, and, urban, prefect, he, estimates, approximately, 5, 000, clerks, he, comments, that, the, expense, the, empire, paid, for, these, was, not, high, as, many, lower, level, clerks, were, not, paid, and, the, wage, of, higher, officials, was, generally, modest, to, avoid, the, possibility, of, local, usurpations, to, facilitate, a, more, efficient, collection, of, taxes, and, supplies, and, to, ease, the, enforcement, of, the, law, diocletian, doubled, the, number, of, provinces, from, fifty, to, almost, one, hundred, the, provinces, were, grouped, into, twelve, dioceses, each, governed, by, an, appointed, official, called, a, vicarius, or, deputy, of, the, praetorian, prefects, some, of, the, provincial, divisions, required, revision, and, were, modified, either, soon, after, 293, or, early, in, the, fourth, century, rome, herself, including, her, environs, as, defined, by, a, 100, mile, 160, km, radius, perimeter, around, the, city, itself, was, not, under, the, authority, of, the, praetorian, prefect, as, she, was, to, be, administered, by, a, city, prefect, of, senatorial, rank, the, sole, prestigious, post, with, actual, power, reserved, exclusively, for, senators, except, for, some, governors, in, italy, with, the, titles, of, corrector, and, the, proconsuls, of, asia, and, africa, the, dissemination, of, imperial, law, to, the, provinces, was, facilitated, by, diocletian, s, reform, of, the, empire, s, provincial, structure, which, meant, that, there, were, now, more, governors, praesides, ruling, over, smaller, regions, and, smaller, populations, diocletian, s, reforms, shifted, the, governors, main, function, to, that, of, the, presiding, official, in, the, lower, courts, whereas, in, the, early, empire, military, and, judicial, functions, were, the, function, of, the, governor, and, procurators, had, supervised, taxation, under, the, new, system, vicarii, and, governors, were, responsible, for, justice, and, taxation, and, a, new, class, of, duces, dukes, acting, independently, of, the, civil, service, had, military, command, these, dukes, sometimes, administered, two, or, three, of, the, new, provinces, created, by, diocletian, and, had, forces, ranging, from, two, thousand, to, more, than, twenty, thousand, men, in, addition, to, their, roles, as, judges, and, tax, collectors, governors, were, expected, to, maintain, the, postal, service, cursus, publicus, and, ensure, that, town, councils, fulfilled, their, duties, this, curtailment, of, governors, powers, as, the, emperors, representatives, may, have, lessened, the, political, dangers, of, an, all, too, powerful, class, of, imperial, delegates, but, it, also, severely, limited, governors, ability, to, oppose, local, landed, elites, especially, those, of, senatorial, status, which, although, with, reduced, opportunities, for, office, holding, retained, wealth, social, prestige, and, personal, connections, particularly, in, relatively, peaceful, regions, without, a, great, military, presence, on, one, occasion, diocletian, had, to, exhort, a, proconsul, of, africa, not, to, fear, the, consequences, of, treading, on, the, toes, of, the, local, magnates, of, senatorial, rank, if, a, governor, of, senatorial, rank, himself, felt, these, pressures, the, difficulties, faced, by, a, mere, praeses, were, likely, greater, this, led, to, a, strained, relationship, between, the, central, power, and, local, elites, sometime, during, 303, attempted, military, sedition, in, seleucia, pieria, and, antioch, prompted, diocletian, to, extract, bloody, retribution, on, both, cities, by, putting, to, death, a, number, of, their, council, members, for, failing, in, their, duties, of, keeping, order, in, their, jurisdiction, as, with, most, emperors, much, of, diocletian, s, daily, routine, rotated, around, legal, affairs, responding, to, appeals, and, petitions, and, delivering, decisions, on, disputed, matters, rescripts, authoritative, interpretations, issued, by, the, emperor, in, response, to, demands, from, disputants, in, both, public, and, private, cases, were, a, common, duty, of, second, and, third, century, emperors, in, the, nomadic, imperial, courts, of, the, later, empire, one, can, track, the, progress, of, the, imperial, retinue, through, the, locations, from, whence, particular, rescripts, were, issued, the, presence, of, the, emperor, was, what, allowed, the, system, to, function, whenever, the, imperial, court, would, settle, in, one, of, the, capitals, there, was, a, glut, in, petitions, as, in, late, 294, in, nicomedia, where, diocletian, kept, winter, quarters, admittedly, diocletian, s, praetorian, prefects, afranius, hannibalianus, julius, asclepiodotus, and, aurelius, hermogenianus, aided, in, regulating, the, flow, and, presentation, of, such, paperwork, but, the, deep, legalism, of, roman, culture, kept, the, workload, heavy, emperors, in, the, forty, years, preceding, diocletian, s, reign, had, not, managed, these, duties, so, effectively, and, their, output, in, attested, rescripts, is, low, diocletian, by, contrast, was, prodigious, in, his, affairs, there, are, around, 1, 200, rescripts, in, his, name, still, surviving, and, these, probably, represent, only, a, small, portion, of, the, total, issue, the, sharp, increase, in, the, number, of, edicts, and, rescripts, produced, under, diocletian, s, rule, has, been, read, as, evidence, of, an, ongoing, effort, to, realign, the, whole, empire, on, terms, dictated, by, the, imperial, center, under, the, governance, of, the, jurists, gregorius, aurelius, arcadius, charisius, and, hermogenianus, the, imperial, government, began, issuing, official, books, of, precedent, collecting, and, listing, all, the, rescripts, that, had, been, issued, since, the, reign, of, hadrian, r, 117, 38, the, codex, gregorianus, includes, rescripts, up, to, 292, which, the, codex, hermogenianus, updated, with, a, comprehensive, collection, of, rescripts, issued, by, diocletian, in, 293, and, 294, although, the, very, act, of, codification, was, a, radical, innovation, given, the, precedent, based, design, of, the, roman, legal, system, the, jurists, were, generally, conservative, and, constantly, looked, to, past, roman, practice, and, theory, for, guidance, they, were, probably, given, more, free, rein, over, their, codes, than, the, later, compilers, of, the, codex, theodosianus, 438, and, codex, justinianus, 529, would, have, gregorius, and, hermogenianus, s, codices, lack, the, rigid, structuring, of, later, codes, and, were, not, published, in, the, name, of, the, emperor, but, in, the, names, of, their, compilers, their, official, character, was, clear, in, that, both, collections, were, acknowledged, by, courts, as, authoritative, records, of, imperial, legislation, up, to, the, date, of, their, publication, and, regularly, updated, after, diocletian, s, reform, of, the, provinces, governors, were, called, iudex, or, judge, the, governor, became, responsible, for, his, decisions, first, to, his, immediate, superiors, as, well, as, to, the, more, distant, office, of, the, emperor, it, was, most, likely, at, this, time, that, judicial, records, became, verbatim, accounts, of, what, was, said, in, trial, making, it, easier, to, determine, bias, or, improper, conduct, on, the, part, of, the, governor, with, these, records, and, the, empire, s, universal, right, of, appeal, imperial, authorities, probably, had, a, great, deal, of, power, to, enforce, behavior, standards, for, their, judges, in, spite, of, diocletian, s, attempts, at, reform, the, provincial, restructuring, was, far, from, clear, especially, when, citizens, appealed, the, decisions, of, their, governors, proconsuls, for, example, were, often, both, judges, of, first, instance, and, appeal, and, the, governors, of, some, provinces, took, appellant, cases, from, their, neighbors, it, soon, became, impossible, to, avoid, taking, some, cases, to, the, emperor, for, arbitration, and, judgment, diocletian, s, reign, marks, the, end, of, the, classical, period, of, roman, law, where, diocletian, s, system, of, rescripts, shows, adherence, to, classical, tradition, constantine, s, law, is, full, of, greek, and, eastern, influences, partly, in, response, to, economic, pressures, and, in, order, to, protect, the, vital, functions, of, the, state, diocletian, restricted, social, and, professional, mobility, peasants, became, tied, to, the, land, in, a, way, that, presaged, later, systems, of, land, tenure, and, workers, such, as, bakers, armorers, public, entertainers, and, workers, in, the, mint, had, their, occupations, made, hereditary, soldiers, children, were, also, forcibly, enrolled, something, that, followed, spontaneous, tendencies, among, the, rank, and, file, but, also, expressed, increasing, difficulties, in, recruitment, it, is, archaeologically, difficult, to, distinguish, diocletian, s, fortifications, from, those, of, his, successors, and, predecessors, the, devil, s, dykes, for, example, the, danubian, earthworks, traditionally, attributed, to, diocletian, cannot, even, be, securely, dated, to, a, particular, century, the, most, that, can, be, said, about, built, structures, under, diocletian, s, reign, is, that, he, rebuilt, and, strengthened, forts, at, the, upper, rhine, frontier, where, he, followed, the, works, built, under, probus, along, the, lake, constance, basel, and, the, rhine, iller, danube, line, on, the, danube, where, a, new, line, of, forts, on, the, far, side, of, the, river, the, ripa, sarmatica, was, added, to, older, rehabilitated, fortresses, in, egypt, and, on, the, frontier, with, persia, beyond, that, much, discussion, is, speculative, and, reliant, on, the, broad, generalizations, of, written, sources, diocletian, and, the, tetrarchs, had, no, consistent, plan, for, frontier, advancement, and, records, of, raids, and, forts, built, across, the, frontier, are, likely, to, indicate, only, temporary, claims, the, strata, diocletiana, built, after, the, persian, wars, which, ran, from, the, euphrates, north, of, palmyra, and, south, towards, northeast, arabia, in, the, general, vicinity, of, bostra, is, the, classic, diocletianic, frontier, system, consisting, of, an, outer, road, followed, by, tightly, spaced, forts, defensible, hard, points, manned, by, small, garrisons, followed, by, further, fortifications, in, the, rear, in, an, attempt, to, resolve, the, difficulty, and, slowness, of, transmitting, orders, to, the, frontier, the, new, capitals, of, the, tetrarchic, era, were, all, much, closer, to, the, empire, s, frontiers, than, rome, had, been, trier, sat, on, the, moselle, a, tributary, of, the, rhine, sirmium, and, serdica, were, close, to, the, danube, thessaloniki, was, on, the, route, leading, eastward, and, nicomedia, and, antioch, were, important, points, in, dealings, with, persia, lactantius, criticized, diocletian, for, an, excessive, increase, in, troop, sizes, declaring, that, each, of, the, four, princes, strove, to, maintain, a, much, more, considerable, military, force, than, any, sole, emperor, had, done, in, times, past, there, began, to, be, fewer, men, who, paid, taxes, than, there, were, who, received, wages, so, that, the, means, of, the, husbandmen, being, exhausted, by, enormous, impositions, the, farms, were, abandoned, cultivated, grounds, became, woodland, and, universal, dismay, prevailed, the, fifth, century, pagan, zosimus, by, contrast, praised, diocletian, for, keeping, troops, on, the, borders, rather, than, keeping, them, in, the, cities, as, constantine, was, held, to, have, done, both, these, views, had, some, truth, to, them, despite, the, biases, of, their, authors, diocletian, and, the, tetrarchs, did, greatly, expand, the, army, and, the, growth, was, mostly, in, frontier, regions, where, the, increased, effectiveness, of, the, new, diocletianic, legions, seem, to, have, been, mostly, spread, across, a, network, of, strongholds, nevertheless, it, is, difficult, to, establish, the, precise, details, of, these, shifts, given, the, weakness, of, the, sources, the, army, expanded, to, about, 580, 000, men, from, a, 285, strength, of, 390, 000, of, which, 310, 000, men, were, stationed, in, the, east, most, of, whom, manned, the, persian, frontier, the, navy, increased, from, approximately, 45, 000, to, approximately, 65, 000, men, diocletian, s, expansion, of, the, army, and, civil, service, meant, that, the, empire, s, tax, burden, grew, since, military, upkeep, took, the, largest, portion, of, the, imperial, budget, any, reforms, here, would, be, especially, costly, the, proportion, of, the, adult, male, population, excluding, slaves, serving, in, the, army, increased, from, roughly, 1, in, 25, to, 1, in, 15, an, increase, judged, excessive, by, some, modern, commentators, official, troop, allowances, were, kept, to, low, levels, and, the, mass, of, troops, often, resorted, to, extortion, or, the, taking, of, civilian, jobs, arrears, became, the, norm, for, most, troops, many, were, even, given, payment, in, kind, in, place, of, their, salaries, were, he, unable, to, pay, for, his, enlarged, army, there, would, likely, be, civil, conflict, potentially, open, revolt, diocletian, was, led, to, devise, a, new, system, of, taxation, in, the, early, empire, 30, bc, ad, 235, the, roman, government, paid, for, what, it, needed, in, gold, and, silver, the, coinage, was, stable, requisition, forced, purchase, was, used, to, supply, armies, on, the, march, during, the, third, century, crisis, 235, 285, the, government, resorted, to, requisition, rather, than, payment, in, debased, coinage, since, it, could, never, be, sure, of, the, value, of, money, requisition, was, nothing, more, or, less, than, seizure, diocletian, made, requisition, into, tax, he, introduced, an, extensive, new, tax, system, based, on, heads, capita, and, land, iugera, with, one, iugerum, equal, to, approximately, 0, 65, acres, and, tied, to, a, new, regular, census, of, the, empire, s, population, and, wealth, census, officials, traveled, throughout, the, empire, assessed, the, value, of, labor, and, land, for, each, landowner, and, joined, the, landowners, totals, together, to, make, citywide, totals, of, capita, and, iuga, the, iugum, was, not, a, consistent, measure, of, land, but, varied, according, to, the, type, of, land, and, crop, and, the, amount, of, labor, necessary, for, sustenance, the, caput, was, not, consistent, either, women, for, instance, were, often, valued, at, half, a, caput, and, sometimes, at, other, values, cities, provided, animals, money, and, manpower, in, proportion, to, its, capita, and, grain, in, proportion, to, its, iuga, most, taxes, were, due, each, year, on, 1, september, and, levied, from, individual, landowners, by, decuriones, decurions, these, decurions, analogous, to, city, councilors, were, responsible, for, paying, from, their, own, pocket, what, they, failed, to, collect, diocletian, s, reforms, also, increased, the, number, of, financial, officials, in, the, provinces, more, rationales, and, magistri, privatae, are, attested, under, diocletian, s, reign, than, before, these, officials, represented, the, interests, of, the, fisc, which, collected, taxes, in, gold, and, the, imperial, properties, fluctuations, in, the, value, of, the, currency, made,

the, new, censuses, would, keep, up, with, changes, in, the, values, of, capita, and, iuga, italy, which, had, long, been, exempt, from, taxes, was, included, in, the, tax, system, from, 290, 291, as, a, diocesis, the, city, of, rome, remained, exempt, the, regions, i, e, provinces, south, of, rome, generally, called, suburbicarian, as, opposed, to, the, northern, annonaria, region, seem, to, have, been, relatively, less, taxed, in, what, probably, was, a, sop, offered, to, the, great, senatorial, families, and, their, landed, properties, diocletian, s, edicts, emphasized, the, common, liability, of, all, taxpayers, public, records, of, all, taxes, were, made, public, the, position, of, decurion, member, of, the, city, council, had, been, an, honor, sought, by, wealthy, aristocrats,

aurelian, s, attempt, to, reform, the, currency, had, failed, the, denarius, was, dead, diocletian, restored, the, three, metal, coinage, and, issued, better, quality, pieces, the, new, system, consisted, of, five, coins, the, aureus, solidus, a, gold, coin, weighing, like, its, predecessors, one, sixtieth, of, a, pound, the, argenteus, a, coin, weighing, one, ninety, sixth, of, a, pound, and, containing, ninety, five, percent, pure, silver, the, follis, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, laureatus, a, which, is, a, copper, coin, with, added, silver, struck, at, the, rate, of, thirty, two, to, the, pound, the, radiatus, a, small, copper, coin, struck, at, the, rate, of, 108, to, the, pound, with, no, added, silver, and, a, coin, known, today, as, the, laureatus, b, a, smaller, copper, coin, struck, at, the, rate, of, 192, to, the, pound, since, the, nominal, values, of, these, new, issues, were, lower, than, their, intrinsic, worth, as, metals, the, state, was, minting, these, coins, at, a, loss, this, practice, could, be, sustained, only, by, requisitioning, precious, metals, from, private, citizens, in, exchange, for, state, minted, coin, of, a, far, lower, value, than, the, price, of, the, precious, metals, requisitioned, by, 301, the, system, was, in, trouble, strained, by, a, new, bout, of, inflation, diocletian, therefore, issued, his, edict, on, coinage, an, act, re, tariffing, all, debts, so, that, the, nummus, the, most, common, coin, in, circulation, would, be, worth, half, as, much, in, the, edict, preserved, in, an, inscription, from, the, city, of, aphrodisias, in, caria, near, geyre, turkey, it, was, declared, that, all, debts, contracted, before, 1, september, 301, must, be, repaid, at, the, old, standards, while, all, debts, contracted, after, that, date, would, be, repaid, at, the, new, standards, it, appears, that, the, edict, was, made, in, an, attempt, to, preserve, the, current, price, of, gold, and, to, keep, the, empire, s, coinage, on, silver, rome, s, traditional, metal, currency, this, edict, risked, giving, further, momentum, to, inflationary, trends, as, had, happened, after, aurelian, s, currency, reforms, the, government, s, response, was, to, issue, a, price, freeze, the, edict, on, maximum, prices, edictum, de, pretiis, rerum, venalium, was, issued, two, to, three, months, after, the, coinage, edict, somewhere, between, 20, november, and, 10, december, 301, the, best, preserved, latin, inscription, surviving, from, the, greek, east, the, edict, survives, in, many, versions, on, materials, as, varied, as, wood, papyrus, and, stone, in, the, edict, diocletian, declared, that, the, current, pricing, crisis, resulted, from, the, unchecked, greed, of, merchants, and, had, resulted, in, turmoil, for, the, mass, of, common, citizens, the, language, of, the, edict, calls, on, the, people, s, memory, of, their, benevolent, leaders, and, exhorts, them, to, enforce, the, provisions, of, the, edict, thereby, restoring, perfection, to, the, world, the, edict, goes, on, to, list, in, detail, over, one, thousand, goods, and, accompanying, retail, prices, not, to, be, exceeded, penalties, are, laid, out, for, various, pricing, transgressions, in, the, most, basic, terms, the, edict, was, ignorant, of, the, law, of, supply, and, demand, it, ignored, the, fact, that, prices, might, vary, from, region, to, region, according, to, product, availability, and, it, ignored, the, impact, of, transportation, costs, in, the, retail, price, of, goods, in, the, judgment, of, the, historian, david, potter, the, edict, was, an, act, of, economic, lunacy, the, fact, that, the, edict, began, with, a, long, rhetorical, preamble, betrays, at, the, same, time, a, moralizing, stance, as, well, as, a, weak, grasp, of, economics, perhaps, simply, the, wishful, thinking, that, criminalizing, a, practice, was, enough, to, stop, it, there, is, no, consensus, about, how, effectively, the, edict, was, enforced, supposedly, inflation, speculation, and, monetary, instability, continued, and, a, black, market, arose, to, trade, in, goods, forced, out, of, official, markets, the, edict, s, penalties, were, applied, unevenly, across, the, empire, some, scholars, believe, they, were, applied, only, in, diocletian, s, domains, widely, resisted, and, eventually, dropped, perhaps, within, a, year, of, the, edict, s, issue, lactantius, has, written, of, the, perverse, accompaniments, to, the, edict, of, goods, withdrawn, from, the, market, of, brawls, over, minute, variations, in, price, of, the, deaths, that, came, when, its, provisions, were, enforced, his, account, may, be, true, but, it, seems, to, modern, historians, exaggerated, and, hyperbolic, and, the, impact, of, the, law,
