fatima, that, muhammad, s, family, line, has, survived, to, this, date, her, name, and, her, epithets, remain, popular, choices, for, muslim, girls, when, muhammad, died, in, 632, fatima, and, her, husband, ali, refused, to, acknowledge, the, authority, of, the, first, caliph, abu, bakr, the, couple, and, their, supporters, held, that, ali, was, the, rightful, successor, of, muhammad, possibly, referring, to, his, announcement, at, the, ghadir, khumm, controversy, surrounds, fatima, s, death, within, six, months, of, muhammad, s, sunni, islam, holds, that, fatima, died, from, grief, in, shia, islam, however, fatima, s, miscarriage, and, death, are, said, to, have, been, the, direct, result, of, her, injuries, during, a, raid, on, her, house, to, subdue, ali, ordered, by, abu, bakr, it, is, believed, that, fatima, s, dying, wish, was, that, the, caliph, should, not, attend, her, funeral, she, was, buried, secretly, at, night, and, her, exact, burial, place, remains, uncertain, her, most, common, epithet, is, al, zahra, lit, the, one, that, shines, the, radiant, which, encodes, her, piety, and, regularity, in, prayer, this, epithet, is, believed, by, the, shia, to, be, a, reference, to, her, primordial, creation, from, light, that, continues, to, radiate, throughout, the, creation, the, shia, ibn, babawahy, d, 991, writes, that, whenever, fatima, prayed, her, light, shone, for, the, inhabitants, of, the, heavens, as, starlight, shines, for, the, inhabitants, of, the, earth, other, titles, of, her, in, shia, are, al, iddiqa, lit, the, righteous, al, tahira, lit, the, pure, al, mubaraka, lit, the, blessed, and, al, mansura, lit, helped, by, god, another, shia, title, is, al, mu, additha, in, view, of, the, reports, that, angels, spoke, to, fatima, on, multiple, occasions, similar, to, mary, mother, of, jesus, fatima, is, also, recognized, as, sayyidat, nisa, al, janna, lit, mistress, of, the, women, of, paradise, and, sayyidat, nisa, al, alamin, lit, mistress, of, the, women, of, the, worlds, in, shia, and, sunni, collections, of, hadith, including, the, canonical, sunni, sahih, al, bukhari, and, sahih, muslim, the, name, fatima, is, from, the, arabic, root, f, t, m, lit, to, wean, and, signifies, the, shia, belief, that, she, her, progeny, and, her, adherents, shi, a, have, been, spared, from, hellfire, alternatively, the, word, fatima, is, associated, in, shia, sources, with, fatir, lit, creator, a, name, of, god, as, the, earthly, symbol, of, the, divine, creative, power, a, kunya, or, honorific, title, of, fatima, in, islam, is, umm, abiha, lit, the, mother, of, her, father, suggesting, that, fatima, was, exceptionally, nurturing, towards, her, father, umm, al, aima, lit, the, mother, of, imams, is, a, kunya, of, fatima, in, twelver, sources, as, eleven, of, the, twelve, imams, descended, from, her, fatima, was, born, in, mecca, to, khadija, the, first, of, muhammad, s, wives, the, mainstream, sunni, view, is, that, khadija, gave, birth, to, fatima, in, 605, ce, at, age, fifty, five, years, before, the, first, quranic, revelations, this, implies, that, fatima, was, over, eighteen, at, the, time, of, her, marriage, which, would, have, been, unusual, in, arabia, twelver, sources, however, report, that, fatima, was, born, in, about, 612, or, 615, ce, when, khadija, would, have, been, slightly, older, the, report, of, the, sunni, ibn, sa, d, in, his, kitab, al, tabaqat, al, kubra, suggests, that, fatima, was, born, when, muhammad, was, about, thirty, five, years, old, the, sunni, view, is, that, fatima, had, three, sisters, named, zaynab, umm, kulthum, and, ruqayyah, who, did, not, survive, muhammad, alternatively, a, number, of, shia, sources, state, that, zainab, ruqayyah, and, umm, kulthum, were, adopted, by, muhammad, after, the, death, of, their, mother, hala, a, sister, of, khadija, according, to, abbas, most, shia, muslims, hold, that, fatima, was, muhammad, s, only, biological, daughter, whereas, fedele, limits, this, belief, to, the, twelver, shia, hyder, reports, that, this, belief, is, prevalent, among, the, shia, in, south, asia, fatima, also, had, three, brothers, all, of, whom, died, in, childhood, fatima, grew, up, in, mecca, while, muhammad, and, his, few, followers, suffered, the, ill, treatment, of, disbelievers, on, one, occasion, she, rushed, to, help, muhammad, when, filth, was, thrown, over, him, at, the, instigation, of, abu, jahl, muhammad, s, enemy, and, a, polytheist, fatima, lost, her, mother, khadija, in, childhood, when, khadija, died, it, is, said, that, gabriel, descended, upon, muhammad, with, a, message, to, console, fatima, fatima, married, muhammad, s, cousin, ali, in, medina, around, 1, or, 2, ah, 623, 5, ce, possibly, after, the, battle, of, badr, there, is, sunni, and, shia, evidence, that, some, of, the, companions, including, abu, bakr, and, umar, had, earlier, asked, for, fatima, s, hand, in, marriage, but, were, turned, down, by, muhammad, who, said, he, was, waiting, for, the, moment, fixed, by, destiny, it, is, also, said, that, ali, was, reticent, to, ask, muhammad, to, marry, fatima, on, account, of, his, poverty, when, muhammad, put, forward, ali, s, proposal, to, fatima, she, remained, silent, which, was, understood, as, a, tacit, agreement, on, the, basis, of, this, report, woman, s, consent, in, marriage, has, always, been, necessary, in, islamic, law, muhammad, also, suggested, that, ali, sell, his, shield, to, pay, the, bridal, gift, mahr, muhammad, performed, the, wedding, ceremony, and, they, prepared, an, austere, wedding, feast, with, gifts, from, other, muslims, shia, sources, have, recorded, that, fatima, donated, her, wedding, gown, on, her, wedding, night, later, the, couple, moved, into, a, house, next, to, muhammad, s, quarters, in, medina, their, marriage, lasted, about, ten, years, until, fatima, s, death, fatima, s, age, at, the, time, of, her, marriage, is, uncertain, reported, between, nine, and, twenty, one, ali, is, said, to, have, been, about, twenty, two, as, with, the, majority, of, muslims, the, couple, lived, in, severe, poverty, in, the, early, years, of, islam, in, particular, both, had, to, do, hard, physical, work, to, get, by, shia, sources, elaborate, that, ali, worked, at, various, jobs, while, fatima, was, responsible, for, domestic, chores, it, has, also, been, related, that, muhammad, taught, the, couple, a, tasbih, to, help, ease, the, burden, of, their, poverty, the, tasbih, of, fatima, consists, of, the, phrases, allah, hu, akbar, lit, god, is, the, greatest, al, hamdu, lillah, lit, all, praise, is, due, to, god, and, subhan, allah, lit, god, is, glorious, their, financial, circumstances, later, improved, after, more, lands, fell, to, muslims, in, the, battle, of, khaybar, fatima, was, at, some, point, given, a, maidservant, named, fidda, following, the, battle, of, uhud, fatima, tended, to, the, wounds, of, her, father, and, regularly, visited, the, graves, to, pray, for, those, killed, in, the, battle, later, fatima, rejected, abu, sufyan, s, pleas, to, mediate, between, him, and, muhammad, fatima, also, accompanied, muhammad, in, the, conquest, of, mecca, among, others, the, sunni, al, suyuti, d, 1505, ascribes, to, muhammad, that, god, ordered, me, to, marry, fatima, to, ali, according, to, veccia, vaglieri, and, klemm, muhammad, also, told, fatima, that, he, had, married, her, to, the, best, member, of, his, family, there, is, another, version, of, this, hadith, in, the, canonical, sunni, collection, musnad, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, in, which, muhammad, lauds, ali, as, the, first, in, islam, the, most, knowledgeable, and, the, most, patient, of, the, muslim, community, nasr, writes, that, the, union, of, fatima, and, ali, holds, a, special, spiritual, significance, for, muslims, as, it, is, seen, as, the, marriage, between, the, greatest, saintly, figures, surrounding, muhammad, ali, did, not, marry, again, while, fatima, was, alive, however, al, miswar, ibn, makhrama, a, companion, who, was, nine, when, muhammad, died, appears, to, be, the, sole, narrator, of, an, alleged, marriage, proposal, of, ali, to, abu, jahl, s, daughter, in, sunni, sources, while, polygyny, is, permitted, in, islam, muhammad, reportedly, banned, this, marriage, from, the, pulpit, saying, that, there, can, be, no, joining, of, the, daughter, of, the, prophet, and, the, daughter, of, the, enemy, of, god, abu, jahl, he, is, also, said, to, have, praised, his, other, son, in, law, possibly, uthman, or, abu, al, as, soufi, notes, that, the, reference, to, the, third, caliph, uthman, might, reflect, the, sunni, orthodoxy, in, which, uthman, is, considered, superior, to, his, successor, ali, buehler, suggests, that, such, sunni, traditions, that, place, ali, in, a, negative, light, should, be, treated, with, caution, as, they, mirror, the, political, agenda, of, the, time, in, shia, sources, by, contrast, fatima, is, reported, to, have, had, a, happy, marital, life, which, continued, until, her, death, in, 11, ah, in, particular, ali, is, reported, to, have, said, whenever, i, looked, at, her, all, my, worries, and, sadness, disappeared, the, sunni, al, hakim, al, nishapuri, d, 1014, and, al, khwarazmi, d, 1173, and, the, shia, al, qadi, al, nu, man, d, 974, and, al, tabari, al, shia, eleventh, century, have, likened, fatima, to, the, full, moon, the, sun, hidden, by, clouds, or, the, sun, that, has, come, out, of, the, clouds, the, first, expression, is, a, common, metaphor, for, beauty, in, arabic, and, persian, the, shia, al, majlesi, d, 1699, explains, that, the, second, expression, is, a, reference, to, fatima, s, chastity, while, the, third, expression, refers, to, her, primordial, light, soufi, details, that, fatima, s, manners, closely, resembled, muhammad, s, her, gait, was, also, similar, to, the, prophet, s, according, to, veccia, vaglieri, who, also, argues, that, fatima, must, have, enjoyed, good, health, on, the, account, of, bearing, multiple, children, her, arduous, house, chores, and, her, journeys, to, mecca, her, sources, are, silent, about, the, appearance, of, fatima, which, leads, her, to, the, conclusion, fatima, was, certainly, not, a, beautiful, woman, in, contrast, the, sunni, al, khwarazmi, relates, from, the, prophet, that, if, beauty, husn, were, a, person, it, would, be, fatima, indeed, she, is, greater, while, some, shia, authors, have, likened, her, to, a, human, houri, fatima, was, severely, bereaved, after, muhammad, s, death, in, a, h, 11, 632, c, e, several, elegies, to, muhammad, attributed, to, fatima, have, survived, and, are, collected, in, a, diwan, of, poetry, at, the, same, time, fatima, also, actively, contested, the, succession, of, abu, bakr, and, maintained, that, ali, was, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, fatima, died, within, six, months, of, her, father, and, her, death, at, a, young, age, is, subject, of, intense, controversy, with, allegations, against, abu, bakr, and, his, ally, umar, as, detailed, below, fadak, was, a, village, located, to, the, north, of, medina, at, a, distance, of, two, days, travel, as, part, of, a, peace, treaty, with, a, jewish, tribe, half, of, the, agricultural, land, of, fadak, was, considered, fay, and, belonged, to, the, prophet, in, line, with, verse, 59, 6, of, the, quran, there, is, some, evidence, that, muhammad, gifted, his, share, of, fadak, to, fatima, when, verse, 17, 26, was, revealed, and, her, agents, managed, the, property, when, muhammad, was, alive, this, is, the, shia, view, among, sunnis, al, suyuti, d, 1505, and, al, dhahabi, d, 1348, are, of, this, view, while, al, jurjani, d, 1078, and, ibn, kathir, d, 1373, are, uncertain, if, the, verse, was, revealed, to, muhammad, in, medina, the, revenue, of, fadak, largely, supported, needy, travelers, the, poor, military, expeditions, and, muhammad, s, family, who, were, forbidden, from, receiving, general, alms, following, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, and, early, in, his, caliphate, abu, bakr, is, said, to, have, seized, fadak, from, fatima, by, evicting, her, agents, possibly, as, a, show, of, authority, to, muhammad, s, clan, banu, hashim, who, had, not, yet, pledged, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, this, is, the, shia, view, among, sunnis, the, charge, of, usurpation, appears, for, instance, in, the, works, of, ibn, hajar, al, haythami, d, 1566, and, ibn, sa, d, d, 845, among, others, the, sunni, al, baladhuri, d, 892, reports, that, fatima, objected, to, abu, bakr, saying, that, fadak, was, a, gift, from, her, father, her, husband, ali, and, a, maid, at, muhammad, s, house, named, umm, aiman, are, reported, to, have, offered, their, testimonies, in, support, of, fatima, by, some, accounts, fatima, also, brought, her, two, sons, as, witnesses, abu, bakr, however, did, not, find, their, testimonies, sufficient, to, establish, the, ownership, of, fatima, requiring, two, men, or, one, man, and, two, women, as, witnesses, per, islamic, law, khetia, adds, that, fatima, might, have, expected, her, closeness, with, muhammad, to, strengthen, her, case, in, the, same, vein, shias, argue, the, truthful, fatima, would, have, not, claimed, something, which, was, not, hers, in, another, account, abu, bakr, agreed, to, return, fadak, to, fatima, but, was, dissuaded, by, his, ally, umar, who, tore, up, the, deed, written, by, abu, bakr, probably, after, abu, bakr, rejected, fatima, s, claim, she, demanded, her, inheritance, from, the, estate, of, her, father, abu, bakr, rejected, this, too, claiming, that, muhammad, had, disinherited, his, family, more, specifically, he, maintained, that, muhammad, had, personally, told, him, that, prophets, do, not, leave, inheritance, and, what, they, leave, behind, is, public, property, that, should, be, administered, by, the, caliph, abu, bakr, was, initially, the, sole, witness, to, this, statement, referred, to, as, the, hadith, of, muhammad, s, inheritance, in, his, al, tabaqat, al, kubra, the, sunni, traditionist, ibn, sa, d, d, 845, furnishes, the, hadith, of, inheritance, with, two, chains, of, transmission, which, include, numerous, prominent, companions, of, muhammad, such, as, umar, uthman, and, zubayr, in, particular, he, includes, in, these, chains, some, notable, hashimites, such, as, ali, and, ibn, abbas, who, are, both, known, to, have, vehemently, disputed, this, claim, of, abu, bakr, in, other, sources, on, the, other, hand, soufi, holds, that, abu, bakr, is, generally, regarded, as, the, only, credible, narrator, of, this, hadith, in, sunni, sources, adding, that, similar, reports, attributed, to, other, companions, have, been, rejected, by, sunnis, along, these, lines, sajjadi, writes, that, all, credible, versions, of, this, hadith, are, narrated, from, abu, bakr, his, ally, umar, his, daughter, aisha, and, malik, ibn, aus, al, hadathan, though, some, primary, sources, have, disputed, whether, the, last, one, was, a, companion, of, muhammad, nevertheless, soufi, notes, that, abu, bakr, s, testimony, is, strong, enough, for, sunnis, to, make, an, exception, to, the, quranic, rules, of, inheritance, twelvers, however, reject, the, authenticity, of, the, hadith, of, inheritance, based, on, their, own, traditions, pointing, also, to, the, contradictions, of, this, hadith, with, the, quran, in, protest, fatima, is, said, to, have, delivered, a, speech, at, the, prophet, s, mosque, known, as, the, sermon, of, fadak, among, other, sources, this, sermon, appears, in, balaghat, al, nisa, a, collection, of, eloquent, speeches, by, muslim, women, though, the, attribution, of, this, speech, to, fatima, is, rejected, by, sunnis, fatima, is, said, to, have, upheld, ali, in, her, speech, as, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, she, is, also, reported, to, have, chastised, abu, bakr, for, denying, her, inheritance, and, accused, him, of, hadith, fabrication, saying, that, muhammad, could, have, not, contradicted, the, quran, to, support, her, claim, she, is, believed, to, have, quoted, verse, 27, 16, of, the, quran, in, which, solomon, inherits, from, his, father, david, and, verse, 19, 6, in, which, zechariah, prays, for, a, son, who, would, inherit, from, him, and, from, the, house, of, jacob, as, reported, in, balaghat, fatima, also, quoted, verses, 8, 75, and, 33, 6, about, the, rights, of, every, muslim, to, inheritance, abu, bakr, terminated, the, status, of, purity, of, muhammad, s, kin, by, forcing, them, to, rely, on, general, alms, which, the, prophet, had, forbidden, for, them, in, his, lifetime, at, the, same, time, abu, bakr, allowed, the, prophet, s, widows, to, inherit, his, quarters, in, medina, in, particular, he, granted, his, daughter, aisha, some, properties, in, the, aliya, part, of, medina, and, in, bahrain, by, maintaining, their, status, abu, bakr, might, have, signaled, to, the, muslim, community, that, his, daughter, aisha, and, the, rest, of, muhammad, s, widows, were, the, true, heirs, of, muhammad, according, to, aslan, madelung, holds, a, similar, view, madelung, suggests, that, the, caliphate, of, abu, bakr, was, inherently, inconsistent, with, maintaining, the, privileged, status, of, muhammad, s, kin, and, applying, the, quranic, rules, of, inheritance, to, them, as, phrased, by, mavani, if, the, banu, hashim, had, inherited, muhammad, s, material, property, then, they, might, have, also, been, expected, to, inherit, the, spiritual, authority, of, muhammad, similar, views, are, voiced, by, jafri, margoliouth, ayoub, and, lalani, while, el, hibri, does, not, view, the, saga, of, fadak, as, a, mere, financial, dispute, according, to, aslan, abu, bakr, s, actions, are, often, regarded, as, a, political, move, to, weaken, muhammad, s, clan, and, strip, his, kin, from, their, privileged, status, aslan, also, argues, that, abu, bakr, s, efforts, were, intended, to, undermine, ali, s, claim, to, the, caliphate, these, efforts, writes, aslan, are, partly, explained, by, abu, bakr, s, conviction, that, the, caliphate, must, reside, outside, of, muhammad, s, clan, and, partly, by, the, personal, enmity, between, abu, bakr, and, ali, madelung, abbas, and, anthony, have, noted, the, poor, relations, between, the, two, men, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, muhammad, s, death, in, 11, 632, the, ansar, natives, of, medina, gathered, in, the, saqifa, lit, courtyard, of, the, sa, ida, clan, the, conventional, wisdom, is, that, they, met, to, decide, on, a, new, leader, for, the, muslim, community, among, themselves, for, madelung, however, the, absence, of, the, muhajirun, migrants, from, mecca, from, this, meeting, suggests, that, the, ansar, gathered, to, re, establish, the, control, of, the, ansar, over, their, city, medina, under, the, belief, that, the, muhajirun, would, mostly, return, to, mecca, after, muhammad, s, death, abu, bakr, and, umar, both, companions, of, muhammad, hastened, to, the, gathering, upon, learning, about, it, after, a, heated, session, in, which, a, chief, of, the, ansar, was, likely, beaten, into, submission, by, umar, those, gathered, at, saqifa, agreed, on, abu, bakr, as, the, new, head, of, the, community, the, saqifa, event, is, said, to, have, excluded, muhammad, s, family, who, were, preparing, to, bury, him, and, most, of, the, muhajirun, to, protest, the, appointment, of, abu, bakr, al, baladhuri, d, 892, reports, that, the, banu, hashim, muhammad, s, clan, and, some, of, his, companions, gathered, at, fatima, s, house, among, them, were, muhammad, s, uncle, abbas, and, his, companion, zubayr, according, to, madelung, the, protesters, including, fatima, held, that, her, husband, ali, was, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, possibly, referring, to, muhammad, s, announcement, at, ghadir, khumm, ali, is, believed, to, have, explained, this, position, to, abu, bakr, after, the, saqifa, affair, abu, bakr, reportedly, tasked, his, ally, umar, with, securing, ali, s, pledge, of, allegiance, as, noted, by, al, tabari, d, 923, the, latter, led, an, armed, mob, to, ali, s, residence, and, threatened, to, set, the, house, on, fire, if, ali, and, his, supporters, would, not, pledge, their, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, the, scene, soon, grew, violent, and, zubayr, was, disarmed, and, carried, away, the, mob, however, retreated, without, ali, s, pledge, after, fatima, pleaded, with, them, as, reported, in, al, imama, wa, al, siyasa, alternatively, al, baladhuri, states, that, ali, capitulated, and, pledged, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, immediately, after, umar, s, threat, in, contrast, the, canonical, sahih, al, bukhari, and, sahih, muslim, relate, that, ali, pledged, to, abu, bakr, after, fatima, died, soufi, comments, that, all, but, one, of, the, traditions, cited, by, al, tabari, and, al, baladhuri, do, not, have, chains, of, transmission, that, reach, back, to, the, time, of, the, conflict, madelung, believes, that, abu, bakr, later, placed, a, boycott, on, ali, and, more, broadly, on, the, banu, hashim, to, abandon, their, support, for, ali, as, a, result, prominent, men, ceased, to, speak, to, ali, according, to, a, sunni, hadith, attributed, to, aisha, hazleton, similarly, writes, that, ali, prayed, alone, even, in, the, mosque, jafri, adds, that, those, who, initially, supported, ali, gradually, turned, and, pledged, their, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, it, appears, that, only, his, wife, fatima, and, their, four, small, children, remained, on, his, side, writes, hazleton, in, line, with, a, statement, to, this, effect, attributed, to, ali, in, nahj, al, balagha, umar, has, been, noted, for, his, severity, and, misogyny, especially, in, shia, sources, umar, s, toughness, shidda, is, cited, in, a, sunni, tradition, by, aisha, as, the, reason, umar, was, excluded, from, a, supposed, attempt, at, reconciliation, between, ali, and, abu, bakr, kelen, describes, an, incident, of, umar, s, violence, against, his, sister, when, she, professed, islam, before, umar, it, is, uncertain, what, followed, the, above, altercation, at, fatima, s, house, shia, sources, allege, that, fatima, suffered, injuries, and, miscarriage, during, a, raid, on, her, house, led, by, umar, in, particular, shia, alleges, that, fatima, miscarried, her, son, muhsin, whose, name, had, been, chosen, by, muhammad, before, his, death, according, to, abbas, these, claims, are, categorically, rejected, by, sunnis, who, maintain, that, muhsin, died, in, infancy, of, natural, causes, the, allegations, of, violence, and, miscarriage, appear, in, some, shia, works, including, the, canonical, kitab, al, kafi, kamil, al, ziyarat, kitab, al, irshad, tarikh, al, ya, qubi, and, dala, il, al, imama, of, these, tarikh, al, ya, qubi, does, not, mention, miscarriage, while, kitab, al, irshad, by, al, mufid, d, 1022, is, quiet, about, any, violence, for, the, latter, considering, that, al, mufid, writes, about, violence, against, fatima, elsewhere, khetia, suspects, that, he, refrained, from, controversial, topics, in, his, kitab, al, irshad, to, render, it, accessible, to, most, twelvers, without, provoking, the, anger, of, sunnis, in, his, al, saqifa, wa, fadak, al, jawhari, d, 935, includes, a, tradition, to, the, effect, that, umar, and, his, men, first, threatened, to, set, fatima, s, house, on, fire, then, they, entered, the, house, despite, her, pleas, and, forced, ali, and, his, supporters, out, of, the, house, the, remainder, of, the, account, in, al, imama, wa, al, siyasa, describes, that, ali, was, pulled, out, of, his, house, by, force, and, threatened, with, death, according, to, khetia, mu, awiya, r, 661, 680, is, known, to, have, alluded, to, the, violent, arrest, of, ali, in, a, letter, to, him, before, the, battle, of, siffin, madelung, is, uncertain, about, the, use, of, force, still, he, notes, that, there, is, evidence, in, sunni, sources, that, fatima, s, house, was, searched, according, to, madelung, ali, later, repeatedly, said, that, he, would, have, resisted, abu, bakr, had, there, been, forty, men, with, him, alternatively, buehler, suggests, that, the, allegations, of, violence, should, be, treated, with, caution, as, they, reflect, the, political, agendas, of, the, time, in, contrast, veccia, vaglieri, is, of, the, view, that, the, shia, allegations, are, based, on, facts, even, if, they, have, been, exaggerated, abbas, writes, that, some, well, regarded, sunni, sources, mention, umar, s, raid, and, fatima, s, injuries, khetia, believes, that, there, are, known, instances, where, sensitive, information, has, been, censored, by, sunni, authors, such, as, the, prominent, jurist, abu, ubayd, al, salam, d, 837, who, was, possibly, concerned, with, the, righteous, representation, of, muhammad, s, companions, similar, allegations, have, emerged, against, al, tabari, and, al, mas, udi, d, 956, along, these, lines, lucas, and, soufi, both, note, the, sunni, tendency, to, minimize, and, neutralize, the, conflicts, among, companions, after, muhammad, particularly, about, the, saqifa, affair, while, these, conflicts, might, have, been, amplified, in, shia, records, both, al, tabari, and, al, mas, udi, note, that, abu, bakr, regretted, the, events, after, saqifa, on, his, deathbed, in, particular, al, tabari, states, that, abu, bakr, wished, he, had, never, opened, fatima, s, house, to, anything, even, though, they, had, locked, it, as, a, gesture, of, defiance, this, appears, to, have, been, a, sensitive, admission, that, has, been, censored, by, the, sunni, author, abu, ubayd, al, salam, in, his, kitab, al, amwal, abu, bakr, s, regret, is, also, cited, by, the, shia, al, ya, qubi, d, 897, 8, sunni, sources, are, nearly, unanimous, that, ali, pledged, his, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, after, fatima, s, death, when, it, became, clear, that, muslims, did, not, broadly, support, his, cause, ali, is, said, to, have, relinquished, his, claims, to, the, caliphate, for, the, sake, of, the, unity, of, a, nascent, islam, which, faced, internal, and, external, threats, according, to, mavani, in, particular, jafri, notes, that, ali, turned, down, proposals, to, forcefully, pursue, the, caliphate, including, an, offer, from, abu, sufyan, in, reference, to, abu, bakr, s, caliphate, madelung, writes, that, a, poem, later, began, to, circulate, among, the, banu, hashim, ending, with, surely, we, have, been, cheated, in, the, most, monstrous, way, ali, forbade, the, poet, to, recite, it, adding, that, the, welfare, of, islam, was, dearer, to, him, than, anything, else, in, sharp, contrast, with, muhammad, s, lifetime, ali, is, believed, to, have, retired, from, public, life, during, the, caliphates, of, abu, bakr, umar, and, uthman, anthony, describes, this, change, in, ali, s, attitude, as, a, silent, censure, of, the, first, three, caliphs, while, he, reportedly, advised, abu, bakr, and, umar, on, government, and, religious, matters, the, mutual, distrust, and, hostility, of, ali, with, abu, bakr, and, umar, is, well, documented, though, largely, downplayed, or, ignored, in, sunni, sources, their, differences, were, epitomized, during, the, proceedings, of, the, electoral, council, in, 644, when, ali, refused, to, be, bound, by, the, precedence, of, the, first, two, caliphs, a, common, sunni, argument, is, that, ali, would, have, never, continued, his, relations, with, umar, had, the, latter, organized, a, raid, on, ali, s, home, a, typical, shia, response, is, that, ali, gave, up, his, rights, and, exercised, restraint, for, the, sake, of, a, nascent, islam, according, to, abbas, fatima, died, in, 11, 632, within, six, months, of, muhammad, s, death, she, was, 18, or, 27, years, old, at, that, time, according, to, shia, and, sunni, sources, respectively, the, exact, date, of, her, death, is, uncertain, but, the, shia, commonly, commemorates, her, death, on, 13, jumada, ii, the, sunni, belief, is, that, fatima, died, from, grief, after, muhammad, s, death, shia, islam, however, holds, that, fatima, s, injuries, during, a, raid, by, umar, directly, caused, her, miscarriage, and, death, shortly, after, al, tabari, mentions, the, suffering, of, fatima, in, her, final, days, shia, traditions, similarly, describe, fatima, s, agony, in, her, final, days, in, particular, the, isma, ili, jurist, al, nu, man, similarly, reports, a, hadith, from, the, fifth, imam, to, the, effect, that, whatever, had, been, done, to, her, by, the, people, caused, fatima, to, become, bedridden, while, her, body, wasted, until, it, became, like, a, specter, this, hadith, seems, to, contain, a, reference, to, fatima, s, injuries, during, the, raid, ayoub, describes, fatima, a, symbol, of, quiet, suffering, in, islamic, piety, in, particular, the, twelver, shia, believe, in, the, redemptive, power, of, the, pain, and, martyrdom, endured, by, the, ahl, al, bayt, including, fatima, for, those, who, empathize, with, their, divine, cause, and, suffering, multiple, sources, report, that, fatima, never, reconciled, with, abu, bakr, and, umar, partly, based, on, a, tradition, to, this, effect, in, the, canonical, sunni, collection, sahih, al, bukhari, there, are, some, accounts, that, abu, bakr, and, umar, visited, fatima, on, her, deathbed, to, apologize, which, madelung, considers, self, incriminatory, as, reported, in, al, imama, wa, al, siyasa, fatima, reminded, the, two, visitors, of, muhammad, s, words, fatima, is, part, of, me, and, whoever, angers, her, has, angered, me, the, dying, fatima, then, told, the, two, that, they, had, indeed, angered, her, and, that, she, would, soon, take, her, complaint, to, god, and, his, prophet, muhammad, there, are, also, sunni, reports, that, fatima, reconciled, with, abu, bakr, and, umar, though, madelung, suggests, that, they, were, invented, to, address, the, negative, implications, of, fatima, s, anger, following, her, will, ali, buried, fatima, secretly, at, night, and, hid, her, burial, plot, according, to, the, sunni, al, tabari, her, dying, wish, was, that, abu, bakr, should, not, attend, the, funeral, and, this, request, was, fulfilled, by, ali, fatima, s, wish, is, believed, to, be, at, odds, with, the, common, practice, of, muslims, who, are, encouraged, to, join, funerals, in, shia, sources, her, wish, for, a, secret, burial, is, viewed, as, a, sign, of, the, disassociation, of, muhammad, s, daughter, with, the, muslim, community, who, largely, failed, to, support, her, against, abu, bakr, the, prominent, twelver, traditionist, al, tusi, d, 1067, reports, an, account, of, the, burial, that, vividly, describes, the, suffering, of, ali, after, the, death, of, his, wife, attributed, to, their, son, husayn, al, mufid, d, 1022, another, notable, twelver, scholar, includes, in, his, ikhtisas, a, related, tradition, ascribed, to, ja, far, al, sadiq, the, sixth, imam, this, tradition, describes, that, the, next, morning, abu, bakr, and, umar, berated, ali, for, the, secret, burial, of, fatima, after, learning, that, this, was, fatima, s, wish, the, account, continues, that, umar, threatened, to, locate, and, exhume, fatima, s, body, and, then, re, bury, her, after, funeral, prayer, according, to, this, account, what, prevented, umar, from, materializing, his, threat, was, ali, s, warning, by, god, as, long, as, i, m, alive, and, zulfiqar, is, in, my, hands, you, will, not, reach, her, and, you, know, best, for, khetia, the, interpretation, is, that, the, loss, of, fatima, was, so, traumatizing, for, ali, that, he, threatened, umar, with, violence, for, the, first, time, despite, his, previous, restraint, fatima, s, exact, burial, place, in, medina, remains, uncertain, with, often, contradictory, reports, the, two, most, probable, locations, for, her, grave, are, the, al, baqi, cemetery, and, her, home, which, was, later, annexed, to, the, prophet, s, mosque, the, former, location, is, reportedly, supported, by, her, son, hasan, s, wish, to, be, buried, next, to, his, mother, on, the, other, hand, the, sunni, al, samhoodi, d, 1533, concludes, that, hasan, is, buried, next, to, his, grandmother, fatimah, bint, asad, rather, than, his, mother, fatima, this, uncertainty, in, shia, sources, again, underscores, fatima, s, displeasure, with, the, muslim, community, fatima, was, survived, by, two, sons, hasan, and, husayn, and, two, daughters, zaynab, and, umm, kulthum, controversy, surrounds, the, fate, of, her, third, son, muhsin, some, canonical, shia, sources, report, that, muhsin, died, in, miscarriage, following, umar, s, raid, on, fatima, s, house, alternatively, sunnis, hold, that, muhsin, died, in, infancy, of, natural, causes, it, is, through, fatima, that, muhammad, s, progeny, has, spread, throughout, the, muslim, world, fatima, s, descendants, are, given, the, honorific, titles, of, sayyid, lit, lord, or, sir, or, sharif, lit, noble, and, are, respected, by, muslims, the, fatimid, dynasty, r, 909, 1171, in, north, africa, claimed, descent, from, fatima, via, the, isma, ili, imam, muhammad, ibn, isma, il, though, this, claim, has, been, challenged, while, fatima, is, not, mentioned, in, the, quran, by, name, some, verses, are, associated, with, her, in, classical, exegeses, an, example, is, verse, 3, 61, of, the, quran, after, an, inconclusive, debate, about, jesus, with, a, christian, delegation, from, najran, in, 10, 631, 2, it, was, decided, to, engage, in, mubuhala, where, both, parties, would, pray, to, invoke, god, s, curse, upon, whoever, was, the, liar, this, is, when, muhammad, is, reported, to, have, received, verse, 3, 61, of, the, quran, also, known, as, the, verse, of, mubahala, which, reads, and, to, whomsoever, disputes, with, thee, over, it, after, the, knowledge, that, has, come, unto, thee, say, come, let, us, call, upon, our, sons, and, your, sons, our, women, and, your, women, ourselves, and, yourselves, then, let, us, pray, earnestly, so, as, to, place, the, curse, of, god, upon, those, who, lie, madelung, argues, that, our, sons, in, the, verse, of, mubahala, must, refer, to, muhammad, s, grandchildren, hasan, and, husayn, in, that, case, he, continues, it, would, be, reasonable, to, also, include, in, the, event, their, parents, ali, and, fatima, madelung, writes, that, their, inclusion, by, muhammad, in, this, significant, ritual, must, have, raised, the, religious, rank, of, his, family, a, similar, view, is, voiced, by, lalani, of, those, present, on, muhammad, s, side, shia, traditions, are, unanimous, that, our, women, refers, to, fatima, and, ourselves, refers, to, ali, in, particular, since, the, verse, refers, to, ali, as, the, self, of, muhammad, shia, holds, that, the, former, enjoys, the, same, authority, as, the, latter, in, contrast, most, sunni, accounts, by, al, tabari, do, not, name, the, participants, of, the, event, while, some, other, sunni, historians, agree, with, the, shia, view, some, accounts, about, mubahala, add, that, muhammad, ali, fatima, hasan, and, husayn, stood, under, muhammad, s, cloak, and, this, five, are, thus, known, as, the, ahl, al, kisa, lit, people, of, the, cloak, on, the, same, occasion, muhammad, is, also, believed, to, have, referred, to, them, as, the, ahl, al, bayt, according, to, shia, and, some, sunni, sources, including, the, canonical, sahih, muslim, and, sunan, al, tirmidhi, the, last, passage, of, verse, 33, 33, also, known, as, the, verse, of, purification, reads, god, only, desires, to, remove, defilement, from, you, o, ahl, al, bayt, and, to, purify, you, completely, muslims, disagree, as, to, who, belong, to, the, ahl, al, bayt, lit, people, of, the, house, and, what, political, privileges, or, responsibilities, they, have, shia, islam, limits, the, ahl, al, bayt, to, the, ahl, al, kisa, namely, muhammad, fatima, ali, hasan, and, husayn, there, are, various, views, in, sunni, islam, though, a, typical, compromise, is, to, include, also, muhammad, s, wives, in, the, ahl, al, bayt, the, verse, of, purification, is, regarded, in, shia, islam, as, evidence, of, the, infallibility, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, the, majority, of, the, traditions, quoted, by, al, tabari, d, 923, in, his, exegesis, identify, the, ahl, al, bayt, in, the, verse, of, purification, with, the, ahl, al, kisa, namely, muhammad, ali, fatima, hasan, and, husayn, these, traditions, are, also, cited, by, some, other, early, sunni, authorities, including, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, d, 855, al, suyuti, d, 1505, al, hafiz, al, kabir, and, ibn, kathir, d, 1373, the, canonical, sunni, collection, sunnan, al, tirmidhi, reports, that, muhammad, limited, the, ahl, al, bayt, to, ali, fatima, and, their, two, sons, when, the, verse, of, purification, was, revealed, to, him, in, the, event, of, mubahala, muhammad, is, believed, to, have, gathered, ali, fatima, and, their, sons, under, his, cloak, and, referred, to, them, as, the, ahl, al, bayt, according, to, shia, and, some, sunni, sources, including, the, canonical, sahih, muslim, and, sunan, al, tirmidhi, veccia, vaglieri, writes, that, muhammad, recited, the, last, passage, of, the, verse, of, purification, every, morning, when, he, passed, by, fatima, s, house, to, remind, her, household, of, the, fajr, prayer, this, makeup, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, is, echoed, by, veccia, vaglieri, and, jafri, and, unanimously, reported, in, shia, sources, possibly, because, the, earlier, injunctions, in, the, verse, of, purification, are, addressed, at, muhammad, s, wives, some, sunni, authors, like, ibn, kathir, include, muhammad, s, wives, in, the, ahl, al, bayt, a, number, of, sunni, hadiths, including, some, narrated, by, ibn, abbas, and, ikrima, also, support, the, inclusion, of, muhammad, s, wives, in, the, ahl, al, bayt, this, view, is, shared, by, goldziher, and, his, coauthors, alternatively, leaman, argues, that, only, those, wives, of, prophets, who, mother, their, successors, are, counted, by, the, quran, in, their, ahl, al, bayt, verse, 42, 23, of, the, quran, also, known, as, the, verse, of, mawadda, includes, the, passage, say, i, ask, not, of, you, any, reward, for, it, save, affection, among, kinsfolk, the, word, kinsfolk, al, qurba, in, this, verse, is, interpreted, by, the, shia, as, the, ahl, al, bayt, ibn, ishaq, d, 767, narrates, that, the, prophet, specified, al, qurba, as, his, daughter, fatima, her, husband, ali, and, their, two, sons, hasan, and, husayn, as, quoted, by, madelung, hasan, ibn, ali, referred, to, the, verse, of, mawadda, in, his, inaugural, speech, as, the, caliph, after, the, assassination, of, his, father, in, 661, saying, that, he, belonged, to, the, ahl, al, bayt, whose, love, he, has, made, obligatory, in, his, book, the, verse, of, mawadda, is, often, cited, by, the, shia, about, the, elevated, status, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, in, twelver, shia, the, affection, in, this, verse, also, entails, obedience, to, the, ahl, al, bayt, as, the, source, of, exoteric, and, esoteric, guidance, this, obedience, is, believed, to, benefit, the, faithful, first, and, foremost, citing, the, following, passage, of, verse, 34, 47, which, contains, the, passage, say, i, ask, not, of, you, any, reward, that, shall, be, yours, fa, huwa, la, kum, some, sunni, commentators, agree, with, the, shia, view, including, baydawi, al, razi, and, ibn, maghazili, most, sunni, authors, however, reject, the, shia, view, and, offer, various, alternatives, the, view, preferred, by, al, tabari, is, that, the, verse, of, mawadda, instructs, muslims, to, love, the, prophet, because, of, their, blood, relations, to, him, alternatively, madelung, suggests, that, the, verse, of, mawadda, demands, love, towards, relatives, in, general, verses, 76, 5, 22, are, connected, to, fatima, in, most, shia, and, some, sunni, sources, including, the, works, of, the, shia, al, tabarsi, d, 1153, and, the, sunni, al, qurtubi, d, 1273, and, al, alusi, d, 1854, according, to, these, exegetes, verses, 76, 5, 22, were, revealed, to, muhammad, after, fatima, ali, hasan, husayn, and, their, maidservant, fidda, gave, away, their, only, meal, of, the, day, to, beggars, who, visited, their, home, for, three, consecutive, days, in, particular, verses, 76, 7, 12, read, they, fulfill, their, vows, and, fear, a, day, whose, evil, is, widespread, and, give, food, despite, loving, it, to, the, indigent, the, orphan, and, the, captive, we, feed, you, only, for, the, face, of, god, we, do, not, desire, any, recompense, or, thanks, from, you, truly, we, fear, from, our, lord, a, grim, calamitous, day, so, god, has, shielded, them, from, the, evil, of, that, day, bestowed, upon, them, radiance, and, joy, and, rewarded, them, for, having, been, patient, with, a, garden, and, with, silk, the, quranic, praise, for, mary, in, verse, 3, 42, has, been, echoed, for, fatima, based, on, a, prophetic, hadith, that, lists, fatima, khadija, mary, and, asiya, as, the, outstanding, women, of, all, time, then, the, angels, said, o, mary, truly, god, has, chosen, you, and, purified, you, and, chosen, you, over, the, women, of, the, world, especially, in, the, shia, literature, there, is, a, strong, parallel, between, fatima, and, mary, to, the, extent, that, one, of, the, shia, epithets, for, fatima, is, maryam, al, kubra, lit, mary, the, greater, similar, to, mary, some, early, sources, report, that, angels, spoke, to, fatima, on, multiple, occasions, both, are, viewed, as, mothers, of, exalted, progenies, mary, gave, birth, to, jesus, and, fatima, is, the, mother, of, the, imams, fatima, surpasses, mary, in, purity, and, divine, favor, in, shia, writings, and, in, some, sunni, sources, for, instance, citing, the, statement, women, s, honor, is, through, their, fathers, the, shia, ibn, shahr, ashub, d, 1192, argues, about, the, superiority, of, fatima, daughter, of, muhammad, over, mary, daughter, of, imran, to, reconcile, the, superiority, of, fatima, with, verse, 3, 42, above, the, women, of, the, world, in, this, verse, is, interpreted, as, the, women, of, mary, s, time, by, most, shia, and, some, sunni, exegetes, verse, 24, 35, of, the, quran, also, known, as, the, verse, of, light, is, often, associated, with, fatima, in, shia, exegeses, the, verse, of, light, begins, as, god, is, the, light, of, the, heavens, and, the, earth, the, parable, of, his, light, is, as, if, there, were, a, niche, and, within, it, a, lamp, the, lamp, enclosed, in, glass, the, glass, as, it, were, a, brilliant, star, according, to, the, shia, al, kulayni, d, 941, fatima, is, in, this, verse, both, the, niche, wherein, resides, the, lamp, i, e, the, imams, and, the, shimmering, glass, for, the, divine, light, the, canonical, sunni, collection, sahih, al, bukhari, attributes, to, muhammad, fatima, is, a, part, of, me, and, whoever, makes, her, angry, makes, me, angry, similar, versions, of, this, hadith, appear, in, other, shia, and, sunni, sources, the, sunni, al, suyuti, relates, from, muhammad, that, whoever, loves, my, offspring, god, loves, whoever, gets, angry, god, gets, angry, at, them, the, shia, ibn, babawahy, similarly, narrates, from, muhammad, that, verily, god, becomes, angry, when, fatima, is, angry, and, is, pleased, when, she, is, pleased, another, prophetic, hadith, in, sahih, al, bukhari, elevates, fatima, to, the, mistress, of, all, the, women, on, earth, and, in, paradise, muhammad, is, also, famously, said, to, have, listed, fatima, khadija, mary, and, asiya, as, the, four, outstanding, women, of, all, time, whenever, fatima, arrived, muhammad, used, to, stand, up, greet, her, and, ask, her, to, sit, next, to, him, when, leaving, medina, fatima, was, the, last, person, that, muhammad, bid, farewell, to, and, she, was, the, first, he, visited, upon, his, return, her, manners, were, described, to, be, similar, to, muhammad, s, the, prophet, held, that, fatima, will, be, the, first, person, to, enter, the, paradise, and, as, with, mary, she, will, intercede, for, those, who, honor, her, and, her, descendants, it, is, attributed, to, abu, bakr, s, daughter, aisha, that, fatima, was, the, most, beloved, of, women, to, the, prophet, and, ali, was, the, most, beloved, of, men, to, him, according, to, the, sunni, al, hakim, al, nishapuri, and, al, tirmidhi, d, 892, and, the, shia, al, qadi, al, nu, man, among, others, a, similar, tradition, is, cited, by, the, sunni, al, suyuti, there, are, also, competing, traditions, about, abu, bakr, aisha, instead, of, ali, fatima, though, spellberg, believes, they, were, circulated, later, for, political, reasons, muhammad, s, wife, umm, salama, relates, in, possibly, the, earliest, version, of, the, hadith, al, kisa, that, muhammad, gathered, ali, fatima, hasan, and, husayn, under, his, cloak, and, prayed, o, god, these, are, my, ahl, al, bayt, lit, the, people, of, my, house, and, my, closest, family, members, remove, defilement, from, them, and, purify, them, completely, thus, making, a, reference, to, verse, 33, 33, of, the, quran, known, also, as, the, verse, of, purification, the, accounts, of, the, sunni, ibn, kathir, and, al, suyuti, and, the, shia, tabatabai, d, 1981, continue, that, umm, salama, asked, muhammad, am, i, with, thee, o, messenger, of, god, but, received, the, negative, response, thou, shalt, obtain, good, thou, shalt, obtain, good, there, also, exists, a, version, of, this, hadith, in, sunni, sources, where, umm, salama, is, included, in, the, ahl, al, bayt, in, another, sunni, version, muhammad, s, servant, wathila, bint, al, asqa, is, counted, in, the, ahl, al, bayt, while,
