evropy, it, was, not, until, after, the, publication, of, this, work, that, he, realized, where, his, strength, lay, and, commenced, his, 12, volume, history, of, the, russian, state, in, order, to, accomplish, the, task, he, secluded, himself, for, two, years, at, simbirsk, when, emperor, alexander, learned, the, cause, of, his, retirement, karamzin, was, invited, to, tver, where, he, read, to, the, emperor, the, first, eight, volumes, of, his, history, he, was, a, strong, supporter, of, the, anti, polish, policies, of, the, russian, empire, and, expressed, hope, that, there, would, be, no,

the, sheets, of, his, great, work, which, the, emperor, read, over, with, him, in, the, gardens, of, the, palace, of, tsarskoye, selo, he, did, not, however, live, to, carry, his, work, further, than, the, eleventh, volume, terminating, it, at, the, accession, of, michael, romanov, in, 1613, he, died, on, 22, may, old, style, 1826, in, the, tauride, palace, a, monument, was, erected, to, his, memory, at, simbirsk, in, 1845, karamzin, is, credited, for, having, introduced, the, letter, into, the, russian, alphabet, some, time, after, 1795, prior, to, that, simple, e, e, had, been, used, though, there, was, also, a, rare, form, patterned, after, the, extant, letter, note, that, is, not, an, obligatory, letter, and, simple, e, e, is, still, often, used, in, books, other, than, dictionaries, and, schoolchildren, s, primers, until, the, appearance, of, his, work, little, had, been, done, in, this, direction, in, russia, the, preceding, attempt, of, vasily, tatishchev, was, merely, a, rough, sketch, inelegant, in, style, and, without, the, true, spirit, of, criticism, karamzin, was, most, industrious, in, accumulating, materials, and, the, notes, to, his, volumes, are, mines, of, interesting, information, perhaps, karamzin, may, justly, be, criticized, for, the, false, gloss, and, romantic, air, thrown, over, the, early, russian, annals, in, this, respect, his, work, is, reminiscent, of, that, of, sir, walter, scott, whose, writings, were, at, that, time, creating, a, great, sensation, throughout, europe, and, probably, influenced, karamzin, karamzin, wrote, openly, as, the, panegyrist, of, the, autocracy, indeed, his, work, has, been, styled, the, epic, of, despotism, and, considered, ivan, iii, as, the, architect, of, russian, greatness, a, glory, that, he, had, earlier, perhaps, while, more, under, the, influence, of, western, ideas, assigned, to, peter, the, great, the, deeds, of, ivan, the, terrible, are, described, with, disgust, though, in, the, battle, pieces, he, demonstrates, considerable, powers, of, description, and, the, characters, of, many, of, the, chief, personages, in, the, russian, annals, are, drawn, in, firm, and, bold, lines, as, a, critic, karamzin, was, of, great, service, to, his, country, in, fact, he, may, be, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, review, and, essay, in, the, western, style, among, the, russians, also, karamzin, is, sometimes, considered, a, founding, father, of, russian, conservatism, upon, appointing, him, a, state, historian, alexander, i, greatly, valued, karamzin, s, advice, on, political, matters, his, conservative, views, were, clearly, expounded, in, the, memoir, on, old, and, new, russia, written, for, alexander, i, in, 1812, this, scathing, attack, on, reforms, proposed, by, mikhail, speransky, was, to, become, a, cornerstone, of, official, ideology, of, imperial, russia, for, years, to, come, several, places, in, russia, were, named, after, the, writer, in, 2016, on,
