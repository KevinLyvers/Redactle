not, taking, the, band, seriously, rather, than, asking, them, to, leave, they, instead, decided, to, break, up, and, then, quietly, reformed, the, band, as, a, four, piece, while, the, band, was, performing, under, the, earth, moniker, they, recorded, several, demos, written, by, norman, haines, such, as, the, rebel, when, i, came, down, and, song, for, jim, the, latter, of, which, being, a, reference, to, jim, simpson, who, was, a, manager, for, the, bands, bakerloo, blues, line, and, tea, symphony, as, well, as, the, trumpet, player, for, the, group, locomotive, simpson, had, recently, started, a, new, club, named, henry, s, blueshouse, at, the, crown, hotel, in, birmingham, and, offered, to, let, earth, play, there, after, they, agreed, to, waive, the, usual, support, band, fee,

his, stint, with, the, band, would, be, short, lived, iommi, made, an, appearance, with, jethro, tull, on, the, rolling, stones, rock, and, roll, circus, tv, show, unsatisfied, with, the, direction, of, jethro, tull, iommi, returned, to, earth, by, the, end, of, the, month, it, just, wasn, t, right, so, i, left, iommi, said, at, first, i, thought, tull, were, great, but, i, didn, t, much, go, for, having, a, leader, in, the, band, which, was, ian, anderson, s, way, when, i, came, back, from, tull, i, came, back, with, a, new, attitude, altogether, they, taught, me, that, to, get, on, you, got, to, work, for, it, while, playing, shows, in, england, in, 1969, the, band, discovered, they, were, being, mistaken, for, another, english, group, named, earth, so, they, decided, to, change, their, name, again, this, name, change, would, give, rise, to, the, well, known, debate, about, the, alleged, aesthetic, influence, of, coven, which, the, british, band, always, denied, a, cinema, across, the, street, from, the, band, s, rehearsal, room, was, showing, the, 1963, italian, horror, film, black, sabbath, starring, boris, karloff, and, directed, by, mario, bava, while, watching, people, line, up, to, see, the, film, butler, noted, that, it, was, strange, that, people, spend, so, much, money, to, see, scary, movies, following, that, osbourne, and, butler, wrote, the, lyrics, for, a, song, called, black, sabbath, which, was, inspired, by, the, work, of, horror, and, adventure, story, writer, dennis, wheatley, along, with, a, vision, that, butler, had, of, a, black, silhouetted, figure, standing, at, the, foot, of, his, bed, making, use, of, the, musical, tritone, also, known, as, the, devil, s, interval, the, song, s, ominous, sound, and, dark, lyrics, pushed, the, band, in, a, darker, direction, a, stark, contrast, to, the, popular, music, of, the, late, 1960s, which, was, dominated, by, flower, power, folk, music, and, hippie, culture, judas, priest, frontman, rob, halford, has, called, the, track, probably, the, most, evil, song, ever, written, inspired, by, the, new, sound, the, band, changed, their, name, to, black, sabbath, in, august, 1969,

the, era, but, modern, day, reviewers, such, as, allmusic, s, steve, huey, cite, paranoid, as, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, influential, heavy, metal, albums, of, all, time, which, defined, the,

with, a, briefcase, full, of, cash, to, buy, drugs, we, were, getting, into, coke, big, time, ward, explained, uppers, downers, quaaludes, whatever, you, like, it, got, to, the, stage, where, you, come, up, with, ideas, and, forget, them, because, you, were, just, so, out, of, it, production, completed, in, april, 1971, and, in, july, the, band, released, master, of, reality, just, six, months, after, the, u, s, release, of, paranoid, the, album, reached, the, top, 10, in, the, u, s, and, the, united, kingdom, and, was, certified, gold, in, less, than, two, months, eventually, receiving,

the, grave, and, sweet, leaf, critical, response, of, the, era, was, generally, unfavourable, with, lester, bangs, delivering, an, ambivalent, review, of, master, of, reality, in, rolling, stone, describing, the, closing, children, of, the, grave, as, na, ve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute, doggerel, but, in, the, tradition, the, only, criterion, is, excitement, and, black, sabbath, s, got, it, in, 2003, rolling, stone, would, place, the, album, at, number, 300, on, their, 500, greatest, albums, of, all, time, list, following, the, master, of, reality, world, tour, in, 1972, the, band, took, their, first, break, in, three, years, as, ward, explained, the, band, started, to, become, very, fatigued, and, very, tired, we, d, been, on, the, road, non, stop, year, in, and, year, out, constantly, touring, and, recording, i, think, master, of, reality, was, kind, of, like, the, end, of, an, era, the, first, three, albums, and, we, decided, to, take, our, time, with, the, next, album, in, june, 1972, the, band, reconvened, in, los, angeles, to, begin, work, on, their, next, album, at, the, record, plant, with, more, time, in, the, studio, the, album, saw, the, band, experimenting, with, new, textures, such, as, strings, piano, orchestration, and, multi, part, songs, recording, was, plagued, with, problems, many, as, a, result, of, substance, abuse, issues, struggling, to, record, the, song, cornucopia, after, sitting, in, the, middle, of, the, room, just, doing, drugs, ward, was, nearly, fired, i, hated, the, song, there, were, some, patterns, that, were, just, horrible, the, drummer, said, i, nailed, it, in, the, end, but, the, reaction, i, got, was, the, cold, shoulder, from, everybody, it, was, like, well, just, go, home, you, re, not, being, of, any, use, right, now, i, felt, like, i, d, blown, it, i, was, about, to, get, fired, butler, thought, that, the, end, product, was, very, badly, produced, as, far, as, i, was, concerned, our, then, manager, insisted, on, producing, it, so, he, could, claim, production, costs, the, album, was, originally, titled, snowblind, after, the, song, of, the, same, name, which, deals, with, cocaine, abuse, the, record, company, changed, the, title, at, the, last, minute, to, black, sabbath, vol, 4, ward, observed, there, was, no, volume, 1, 2, or, 3, so, it, s, a, pretty, stupid, title, really, vol, 4, was, released, in, september, 1972, and, while, critics, were, dismissive, it, achieved, gold, status, in, less, than, a, month, and, was, the, band, s, fourth, consecutive, release, to, sell, a, million, in, the, u, s, tomorrow, s, dream, was, released, as, a, single, the, band, s, first, since, paranoid, but, failed, to, chart, following, an, extensive, tour, of, the, u, s, in, 1973, the, band, travelled, again, to, australia, followed, by, a, tour, for, the, first, time, to, new, zealand, before, moving, onto, mainland, europe, the, band, were, definitely, in, their, heyday, recalled, ward, in, the, sense, that, nobody, had, burnt, out, quite, yet, following, the, vol, 4, world, tour, black, sabbath, returned, to, los, angeles, to, begin, work, on, their, next, release, pleased, with, the, vol, 4, album, the, band, sought, to, recreate, the, recording, atmosphere, and, returned, to, the, record, plant, studio, in, los, angeles, with, new, musical, innovations, of, the, era, the, band, were, surprised, to, find, that, the, room, they, had, used, previously, at, the, record, plant, was, replaced, by, a, giant, synthesiser, the, band, rented, a, house, in, bel, air, and, began, writing, in, the, summer, of, 1973, but, in, part, because, of, substance, issues, and, fatigue, they, were, unable, to, complete, any, songs, ideas, weren, t, coming, out, the, way, they, were, on, vol, 4, and, we, really, got, discontent, iommi, said, everybody, was, sitting, there, waiting, for, me, to, come, up, with, something, i, just, couldn, t, think, of, anything, and, if, i, didn, t, come, up, with, anything, nobody, would, do, anything, after, a, month, in, los, angeles, with, no, results, the, band, opted, to, return, to, england, they, rented, clearwell, castle, in, the, forest, of, dean, we, rehearsed, in, the, dungeons, and, it, was, really, creepy, but, it, had, some, atmosphere, it, conjured, up, things, and, stuff, started, coming, out, again, while, working, in, the, dungeon, iommi, stumbled, onto, the, main, riff, of, sabbath, bloody, sabbath, which, set, the, tone, for, the, new, material, recorded, at, morgan, studios, in, london, by, mike, butcher, and, building, off, the, stylistic, changes, introduced, on, vol, 4, new, songs, incorporated, synthesisers, strings, and, complex, arrangements, yes, keyboardist, rick, wakeman, was, brought, in, as, a, session, player, appearing, on, sabbra, cadabra, in, november, 1973, black, sabbath, began, to, receive, positive, reviews, in, the, mainstream, press, after, the, release, of, sabbath, bloody, sabbath, with, gordon, fletcher, of, rolling, stone, calling, the, album, an, extraordinarily, gripping, affair, and, nothing, less, than, a, complete, success, later, reviewers, such, as, allmusic, s, eduardo, rivadavia, cite, the, album, as, a, masterpiece, essential, to, any, heavy, metal, collection, while, also, displaying, a, newfound, sense, of, finesse, and, maturity,

years, of, litigation, black, sabbath, began, work, on, their, sixth, album, in, february, 1975, again, in, england, at, morgan, studios, in, willesden, this, time, with, a, decisive, vision, to, differ, the, sound, from, sabbath, bloody, sabbath, we, could, ve, continued, and, gone, on, and, on, getting, more, technical, using, orchestras, and, everything, else, which, we, didn, t,

best, record, since, paranoid, it, might, be, their, best, ever, although, later, reviewers, such, as, allmusic, noted, that, the, magical, chemistry, that, made, such, albums, as, paranoid, and, volume, 4, so, special, was, beginning, to, disintegrate, sabotage, reached, the, top, 20, in, both, the, u, s, and, the, united, kingdom, but, was, the, band, s, first, release, not, to, achieve,

allmusic, gave, the, album, two, stars, and, noted, that, the, band, was, unravelling, at, an, alarming, rate, the, album, featured, less, of, the, doomy, ominous, sound, of, previous, efforts, and, incorporated, more, synthesisers, and, uptempo, rock, songs, technical, ecstasy, failed, to, reach, the, top, 50, in, the, u, s, and, was, the, band, s, second, consecutive, release, not, to, achieve, platinum, status, although, it, was, later, certified, gold, in, 1997, the, album, included, dirty, women, which, remains, a, live, staple, as, well, as, ward, s, first, lead, vocal, on, the, song,

dave, walker, a, longtime, friend, of, the, band, who, had, previously, been, a, member, of, fleetwood, mac, and, savoy, brown, and, informed, him, that, osbourne, had, left, the, band, walker, who, was, at, that, time, fronting, a, band, called, mistress, flew, to, birmingham, from, california, in, late, 1977, to, write, material, and, rehearse, with, black, sabbath, on, 8, january, 1978, walker, made, his, only, live, performance, with, black, sabbath, on, vocals, when, they, played, an, early, version, of, the, song, junior, s, eyes, on, the, bbc, television, programme, look, hear, walker, later, recalled, that, while, in, birmingham, he, had, bumped, into, osbourne, in, a, pub, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, osbourne, was, not, fully, committed, to, leaving, black, sabbath, the, last, sabbath, albums, were, just, very, depressing, for, me, osbourne, said, i, was, doing, it, for, the, sake, of, what, we, could, get, out, of, the, record, company, just, to, get, fat, on, beer, and, put, a, record, out, walker, has, said, that, he, wrote, a, lot, of, lyrics, during, his, brief, time, in, the, band, but, none, of, them, were, ever, used, if, any, recordings, of, this, version, of, the, band, other, than, the, look, hear, footage, still, exist, walker, says, that, he, is, not, aware, of, them, osbourne, initially, set, out, to, form, a, solo, project, featuring, former, dirty, tricks, members, john, frazer, binnie, terry, horbury, and, andy, bierne, as, the, new, band, were, in, rehearsals, in, january, 1978, osbourne, had, a, change, of, heart, and, rejoined, black, sabbath, three, days, before, we, were, due, to, go, into, the, studio, ozzy, wanted, to, come, back, to, the, band, iommi, explained, he, wouldn, t, sing, any, of, the, stuff, we, d, written, with, the, other, guy, walker, so, it, made, it, very, difficult, we, went, into, the, studio, with, basically, no, songs, we, d, write, in, the, morning, so, we, could, rehearse, and, record, at, night, it, was, so, difficult, like, a, conveyor, belt, because, you, couldn, t, get, time, to, reflect, on, stuff, is, this, right, is, this, working, properly, it, was, very, difficult, for, me, to, come, up, with, the, ideas, and, putting, them, together, that, quick, the, band, spent, five, months, at, sounds, interchange, studios, in, toronto, ontario, canada, writing, and, recording, what, would, become, never, say, die, it, took, quite, a, long, time, iommi, said, we, were, getting, really, drugged, out, doing, a, lot, of, dope, we, d, go, down, to, the, sessions, and, have, to, pack, up, because, we, were, too, stoned, we, d, have, to, stop, nobody, could, get, anything, right, we, were, all, over, the, place, everybody, s, playing, a, different, thing, we, d, go, back, and, sleep, it, off, and, try, again, the, next, day, the, album, was, released, in, september, 1978, reaching, number, 12, in, the, united, kingdom, and, number, 69, in, the, u, s, press, response, was, unfavourable, and, did, not, improve, over, time, with, eduardo, rivadavia, of, allmusic, stating, two, decades, after, its, release, that, the, album, s, unfocused, songs, perfectly, reflected, the, band, s, tense, personnel, problems, and, drug, abuse, the, album, featured, the, singles, never, say, die, and, hard, road, both, of, which, cracked, the, top, 40, in, the, united, kingdom, the, band, also, made, their, second, appearance, on, the, bbc, s, top, of, the, pops, performing, never, say, die, it, took, nearly, 20, years, for, the, album, to, be, certified, gold, in, the, u, s, touring, in, support, of, never, say, die, began, in, may, 1978, with, openers, van, halen, reviewers, called, black, sabbath, s, performance, tired, and, uninspired, a, stark, contrast, to, the, youthful, performance, of, van, halen, who, were, touring, the, world, for, the, first, time, the, band, filmed, a, performance, at, the, hammersmith, odeon, in, june, 1978, which, was, later, released, on, dvd, as, never, say, die, the, final, show, of, the, tour, and, osbourne, s, last, appearance, with, the, band, until, later, reunions, was, in, albuquerque, new, mexico, on, 11,

album, the, entire, band, were, abusing, both, alcohol, and, other, drugs, but, iommi, says, osbourne, was, on, a, totally, different, level, altogether, the, band, would, come, up, with, new, song, ideas, but, osbourne, showed, little, interest, and, would, refuse, to, sing, them, pressure, from, the, record, label, and, frustrations, with, osbourne, s, lack, of, input, coming, to, a, head, iommi, made, the, decision, to, fire, osbourne, in, 1979, iommi, believed, the, only, options, available, were, to, fire, osbourne, or, break, the, band, up, completely, at, that, time, ozzy, had, come, to, an, end, iommi, said, we, were, all, doing, a, lot, of, drugs, a, lot, of, coke, a, lot, of, everything, and, ozzy, was, getting, drunk, so, much, at, the, time, we, were, supposed, to, be, rehearsing, and, nothing, was, happening, it, was, like, rehearse, today, no, we, ll, do, it, tomorrow, it, really, got, so, bad, that, we, didn, t, do, anything, it, just, fizzled, out, ward, who, was, close, with, osbourne, was, chosen, by, iommi, to, break, the, news, to, the, singer, on, 27, april, 1979, i, hope, i, was, professional, i, might, not, have, been, actually, when, i, m, drunk, i, am, horrible, i, am, horrid, ward, said, alcohol, was, definitely, one, of, the, most, damaging, things, to, black, sabbath, we, were, destined, to, destroy, each, other, the, band, were, toxic, very, toxic, sharon, arden, later, sharon, osbourne, daughter, of, black, sabbath, manager, don, arden, suggested, former, rainbow, vocalist, ronnie, james, dio, to, replace, ozzy, osbourne, in, 1979, don, arden, was, at, this, point, still, trying, to, convince, osbourne, to, rejoin, the, band, as, he, viewed, the, original, line, up, as, the, most, profitable, dio, officially, joined, in, june, and, the, band, began, writing, their, next, album, with, a, notably, different, vocal, style, from, osbourne, s, dio, s, addition, to, the, band, marked, a, change, in, black, sabbath, s, sound, they, were, totally, different, altogether, iommi, explains, not, only, voice, wise, but, attitude, wise, ozzy, was, a, great, showman, but, when, dio, came, in, it, was, a, different, attitude, a, different, voice, and, a, different, musical, approach, as, far, as, vocals, dio, would, sing, across, the, riff, whereas, ozzy, would, follow, the, riff, like, in, iron, man, ronnie, came, in, and, gave, us, another, angle, on, writing, geezer, butler, temporarily, left, the, band, in, september, 1979, for, personal, reasons, according, to, dio, the, band, initially, hired, craig, gruber, with, whom, dio, had, previously, played, while, in, elf, and, rainbow, on, bass, to, assist, with, writing, the, new, album, gruber, was, soon, replaced, by, geoff, nicholls, of, quartz, the, new, line,

the, band, it, was, intolerable, for, me, to, get, on, the, stage, without, ozzy, and, i, drank, 24, hours, a, day, my, alcoholism, accelerated, geezer, butler, stated, that, after, ward, s, final, show, the, drummer, came, in, drunk, stating, that, he, might, as, well, be, a, martian, ward, then, got, angry, packed, his, things, and, got, on, a, bus, to, leave, following, ward, s, sudden, departure, the, group, hired, drummer, vinny, appice, further, trouble, for, the, band, came, during, their, 9, october, 1980, concert, at, the, milwaukee, arena, which, degenerated, into, a, riot, that, caused, 10, 000, in, damages, to, the, arena, and, resulted, in, 160, arrests, according, to, the, associated, press, the, crowd, of, mostly, adolescent, males, first, became, rowdy, in, a, performance, by, the, blue, oyster, cult, and, then, grew, restless, while, waiting, an, hour, for, black, sabbath, to, begin, playing, a, member, of, the, audience, threw, a, beer, bottle, that, struck, bassist, butler, and, effectively, ended, the, show, the, band, then, abruptly, halted, its, performance, and, began, leaving, as, the, crowd, rioted, the, band, completed, the, heaven, and,

featured, ronnie, james, dio, as, vocalist, mob, rules, was, released, in, october, 1981, and, was, well, received, by, fans, but, less, so, by, critics, rolling, stone, reviewer, j, d, considine, gave, the, album, one, star, claiming, mob, rules, finds, the, band, as, dull, witted, and, flatulent, as, ever, like, most, of, the, band, s, earlier, work, time, helped, to, improve, the, opinions, of, the, music, press, a, decade, after, its, release, allmusic, s, eduardo, rivadavia, called, mob, rules, a, magnificent, record, the, album, was, certified, gold, and, reached, the, top, 20, on, the, uk, chart, the, album, s, title, track, the, mob, rules, which, was, recorded, at, john, lennon, s, old, house, in, england, was, also, featured, in, the, 1981, animated, film, heavy, metal,

titled, live, evil, during, the, mob, rules, world, tour, across, the, united, states, in, dallas, san, antonio, and, seattle, in, 1982, during, the, mixing, process, for, the, album, iommi, and, butler, had, a, falling, out, with, dio, misinformed, by, their, then, current, mixing, engineer, iommi, and, butler, accused, dio, of, sneaking, into, the, studio, at, night, to, raise, the, volume, of, his, vocals, in, addition, dio, was, not, satisfied, with, the, pictures, of, him, in, the, artwork, butler, also, accused, dio, and, appice, of, working, on, a, solo, album, during, the, album, s, mixing, without, telling, the, other, members, of, black, sabbath, ronnie, wanted, more, say, in, things, iommi, said, and, geezer, would, get, upset, with, him, and, that, is, where, the, rot, set, in, live, evil, is, when, it, all, fell, apart, ronnie, wanted, to, do, more, of, his, own, thing, and, the, engineer, we, were, using, at, the, time, in, the, studio, didn, t, know, what, to, do, because, ronnie, was, telling, him, one, thing, and, we, were, telling, him, another, at, the, end, of, the, day, we, just, said, that, s, it, the, band, is, over, when, it, comes, time, for, the, vocal, nobody, tells, me, what, to, do, nobody, because, they, re, not, as, good, as, me, so, i, do, what, i, want, to, do, dio, later, said, i, refuse, to, listen, to, live, evil, because, there, are, too, many, problems, if, you, look, at, the, credits, the, vocals, and, drums, are, listed, off, to, the, side, open, up, the, album, and, see, how, many, pictures, there, are, of, tony, and, how, many, there, are, of, me, and, vinny, ronnie, james, dio, left, black, sabbath, in, november, 1982, to, start, his, own, band, and, took, drummer, vinny, appice, with, him, live, evil, was,

singers, for, the, band, s, next, release, deep, purple, and, whitesnake, s, david, coverdale, samson, s, nicky, moore, and, lone, star, s, john, sloman, were, all, considered, and, iommi, states, in, his, autobiography, that, michael, bolton, auditioned, the, band, settled, on, former, deep, purple, vocalist, ian, gillan, to, replace, dio, in, december, 1982, the, project, was, initially, not, to, be, called, black, sabbath, but, pressure, from, the, record, label, forced, the, group, to, retain, the, name, the, band, entered, the, manor, studios, in, shipton, on, cherwell, oxfordshire, in, june, 1983, with, a, returned, and, newly, sober, bill, ward, on, drums, that, was, the, very, first, album, that, i, ever, did, clean, and, sober, ward, recalled, i, only, got, drunk, after, i, finished, all, my, work, on, the, album, which, wasn, t, a, very, good, idea, sixty, to, seventy, per, cent, of, my, energy, was, taken, up, on, learning, how, to, get, through, the, day, without, taking, a, drink, and, learning, how, to, do, things, without, drinking, and, thirty, per, cent, of, me, was, involved, in, the, album, born, again, 7, august, 1983, was, panned, on, release, by, critics, despite, this, negative, reception, it, reached, number, four, in, the, uk, and, number, 39, in, the, u, s, even, three, decades, after, its, release, allmusic, s, eduardo, rivadavia, called, the, album, dreadful, noting, that, gillan, s, bluesy, style, and, humorous, lyrics, were, completely, incompatible, with, the, lords, of, doom, and, gloom, unable, to, tour, because, of, the, pressures, of, the, road, ward, quit, the, band, i, fell, apart, with, the, idea, of, touring, he, later, explained, i, got, so, much, fear, behind, touring, i, didn, t, talk, about, the, fear, i, drank, behind, the, fear, instead, and, that, was, a, big, mistake, he, was, replaced, by, former, electric, light, orchestra, drummer, bev, bevan, for, the, born, again, 83, 84, world, tour, often, unofficially, referred, to, as, the, feighn, death, sabbath, 83, 84, world, tour, which, began, in, europe, with, diamond, head, and, later, in, the, u, s, with, quiet, riot, and, night, ranger, the, band, headlined, the, 1983, reading, festival, in, england, adding, deep, purple, s, smoke, on, the, water, to, their, encore, the, tour, in, support, of, born, again, included, a, giant, set, of, the, stonehenge, monument, in, a, move, later, parodied, in, the, mockumentary, this, is, spinal, tap, the, band, made, a, mistake, in, ordering, the, set, piece, butler, explained, we, had, sharon, osbourne, s, dad, don, arden, managing, us, he, came, up, with, the, idea, of, having, the, stage, set, be, stonehenge, he, wrote, the, dimensions, down, and, gave, it, to, our, tour, manager, he, wrote, it, down, in, metres, but, he, meant, to, write, it, down, in, feet, the, people, who, made, it, saw, fifteen, metres, instead, of, fifteen, feet, it, was, 45, feet, high, and, it, wouldn, t, fit, on, any, stage, anywhere, so, we, just, had, to, leave, it, in, the, storage, area, it, cost, a, fortune, to, make, but, there, was, not, a, building, on, earth, that, you, could, fit, it, into, following, the, completion, of, the, born, again, tour, in, march, 1984, vocalist, ian, gillan, left, black, sabbath, to, re, join, deep, purple, which, was, reforming, after, a, long, hiatus, bevan, left, at, the, same, time, and, gillan, remarked, that, he, and, bevan, were, made, to, feel, like, hired, help, by, iommi, the, band, then, recruited, an, unknown, los, angeles, vocalist, named, david, donato, and, ward, once, again, rejoined, the, band, the, new, line, up, wrote, and, rehearsed, throughout, 1984, and, eventually, recorded, a, demo, with, producer, bob, ezrin, in, october, unhappy, with, the, results, the, band, parted, ways, with, donato, shortly, after, disillusioned, with, the, band, s, revolving, line, up, ward, left, shortly, after, stating, this, isn, t, black, sabbath, butler, would, quit, sabbath, next, in, november, 1984, to, form, a, solo, band, when, ian, gillan, took, over, that, was, the, end, of, it, for, me, he, said, i, thought, it, was, just, a, joke, and, i, just, totally, left, when, we, got, together, with, gillan, it, was, not, supposed, to, be, a, black, sabbath, album, after, we, had, done, the, album, we, gave, it, to, warner, bros, and, they, said, they, were, going, to, put, it, out, as, a, black, sabbath, album, and, we, didn, t, have, a, leg, to, stand, on, i, got, really, disillusioned, with, it, and, gillan, was, really, pissed, off, about, it, that, lasted, one, album, and, one, tour, and, then, that, was, it, one, vocalist, whose, status, is, disputed, both, inside, and, outside, sabbath, is, christian, evangelist, and, former, joshua, frontman, jeff, fenholt, fenholt, insists, he, was, a, singer, in, sabbath, between, january, and, may, 1985, iommi, has, never, confirmed, this, fenholt, gives, a, detailed, account, in, garry, sharpe, young, s, book, sabbath, bloody, sabbath, the, battle, for, black, sabbath, following, both, ward, s, and, butler, s, exits, sole, remaining, original, member, iommi, put,

spot, at, bob, geldof, s, live, aid, performing, at, the, philadelphia, show, on, 13, july, 1985, this, event, which, also, featured, reunions, of, the, who, and, led, zeppelin, marked, the, first, time, the, original, line, up, had, appeared, on, stage, since, 1978, we, were, all, drunk, when, we, did, live, aid, recalled, geezer, butler, but, we, d, all, got, drunk, separately, returning, to, his, solo, work, iommi, enlisted, bassist, dave, spitz, ex, great, white, drummer, eric, singer, and, initially, intended, to, use, multiple, singers, including, rob, halford, of, judas, priest, former, deep, purple, and, trapeze, vocalist, glenn, hughes, and, former, sabbath, vocalist, ronnie, james, dio, this, plan, didn, t, work, as, he, forecasted, we, were, going, to, use, different, vocalists, on, the, album, guest, vocalists, but, it, was, so, difficult, getting, it, together, and, getting, releases, from, their, record, companies, glenn, hughes, came, along, to, sing, on, one, track, and, we, decided, to, use, him, on, the, whole, album, the, band, spent, the, remainder, of, the, year, in, the, studio, recording, what, would, become, seventh, star, 1986, warner, bros,

and, released, the, album, as, black, sabbath, featuring, tony, iommi, in, january, 1986, it, opened, up, a, whole, can, of, worms, iommi, explained, if, we, could, have, done, it, as, a, solo, album, it, would, have, been, accepted, a, lot, more, seventh, star, sounded, little, like, a, sabbath, album, incorporating, instead, elements, popularised, by, the, 1980s, sunset, strip, hard, rock, scene, it, was, panned, by, the, critics, of, the, era, although, later, reviewers, such, as, allmusic, gave, album, verdicts, calling, the, album, often, misunderstood, and, underrated, the, new, line, up, rehearsed, for, six, weeks, preparing, for, a, full, world, tour, although, the, band, were, eventually, forced, to, use, the, sabbath, name, i, was, into, the, tony, iommi, project, but, i, wasn, t, into, the, black, sabbath, moniker, hughes, said, the, idea, of, being, in, black, sabbath, didn, t, appeal, to, me, whatsoever, glenn, hughes, singing, in, black, sabbath, is, like, james, brown,
