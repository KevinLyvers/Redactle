submitted, the, story, for, pulitzer, prize, consideration, and, cooke, was, awarded, the, pulitzer, prize, for, feature, writing, on, april, 13, 1981, the, story, was, then, found, to, be, a, complete, fabrication, and, the, pulitzer, was, returned, in, retrospect, woodward, made, the, following, statement, i, was, blown, away, by, the, story, i, think, that, the, decision, to, nominate, the, story, for, a, pulitzer, is, of, minimal, consequence, i, also, think, that, it, won, is, of, little, consequence, it, is, a, brilliant, story, fake, and, fraud, that, it, is, it, would, be, absurd, for, me, or, any, other, editor, to, review, the, authenticity, or, accuracy, of, stories, that, are, nominated, for, prizes, china, s, alleged, role, in, the, 1996, united, states, campaign, finance, controversy, first, gained, public, attention, when, woodward, and, brian, duffy, published, a, story, stating, that, a, united, states, department, of, justice, investigation, into, the,

events, at, camp, david, in, the, aftermath, of, september, 11, and, discussed, the, worldwide, attack, matrix, woodward, believed, the, bush, administration, s, claims, of, iraqi, weapons, of, mass, destruction, prior, to, the, war, during, an, appearance, on, larry, king, live, he, was, asked, by, a, telephone, caller, suppose, we, go, to, war, and, go, into, iraq, and, there, are, no, weapons, of, mass, destruction, woodward, responded, i, think, the, chance, of, that, happening, is, about, zero, there, s, just, too, much, there, woodward, later, admitted, his, error, saying, i, think, i, dropped, the, ball, here, i, should, have, pushed, much, much, harder, on, the, skepticism, about, the, reality, of, wmd, in, other, words, said, hey, look, the, evidence, is, not, as, strong, as, they, were, claiming, in, 2008, as, a, part, of, the, talks, at, google, series, woodward, who, was, interviewed, by, google, ceo, eric, schmidt, said, that, he, had, a, fourth, book, in, his, bush, at, war, series, in, the, making, he, then, added, jokingly, that, his, wife, had, told, him, that, she, would, kill, him, if, he, decides, to, write, a, fifth, in, the, series, on, november, 14, 2005, woodward, gave, a, two, hour, deposition, to, special, counsel, patrick, fitzgerald, he, testified, that, a, senior, administration, official, told, him, in, june, 2003, that, iraq, war, critic, joe, wilson, s, wife, later, identified, as, valerie, plame, worked, for, the, cia, as, a, wmd, analyst, not, as, an, undercover, operative, woodward, appears, to, have, been, the, first, reporter, to, learn, about, her, employment, albeit, not, her, name, from, a, government, source, the, deposition, was, reported, in, the, washington, post, on, november, 16, 2005, and, was, the, first, time, woodward, revealed, publicly, that, he, had, any, special, knowledge, about, the, case, woodward, testified, the, information, was, given, to, him, in, a, casual, and, offhand, manner, and, said, that, he, does, not, believe, it, was, part, of, any, coordinated, effort, to, out, plame, as, a, cia, employee, later, woodward, s, source, identified, himself, it, was, richard, armitage, colin, powell, s, deputy, and, an, internal, critic, of, the, iraq, war, and, the, white, house, inner, circle, woodward, said, the, revelation, came, at, the, end, of, a, long, confidential, background, interview, for, his, 2004, book, plan, of, attack, he, did, not, reveal, the, official, s, disclosure, at, the, time, because, it, did, not, strike, him, as, important, later, he, kept, it, to, himself, because, it, came, as, part, of, a, confidential, conversation, with, a, source, in, his, deposition, woodward, also, said, that, he, had, conversations, with, scooter, libby, after, the, june, 2003, conversation, with, his, confidential, administration, source, and, testified, that, it, is, possible, that, he, might, have, asked, libby, further, questions, about, joe, wilson, s, wife, before, her, employment, at, the, cia, and, her, identity, were, publicly, known, woodward, apologized, to, leonard, downie, jr, editor, of, the, washington, post, for, not, informing, him, earlier, of, the, june, 2003, conversation, downie, accepted, the, apology, and, said, even, had, the, paper, known, it, would, not, have, changed, its, reporting, new, york, university, professor, jay, rosen, severely, criticized, woodward, for, allegedly, being, co, opted, by, the, bush, white, house, and, also, for, not, telling, the, truth, about, his, role, in, the, plame, affair, writing, not, only, is, woodward, not, in, the, hunt, but, he, is, slowly, turning, into, the, hunted, part, of, what, remains, to, be, uncovered, is, how, woodward, was, played, by, the, bush, team, and, what, they, thought, they, were, doing, by, leaking, to, him, as, well, as, what, he, did, with, the, dubious, information, he, got, although, woodward, is, no, longer, employed, by, the, post, woodward, has, continued, to, write, books, and, report, stories, for, the, washington, post, and, has, the, title, of, associate, editor, at, the, paper, which, was, described, by, post, media, columnist, margaret,

in, which, he, criticized, the, obama, administration, for, their, statements, in, 2012, and, 2013, that, the, sequester, had, been, proposed, by, republicans, in, congress, woodward, said, his, research, showed, that, the, sequester, proposal, had, originated, with, the, white, house, press, secretary, jay, carney, confirmed, the, sequester, was, something, that, was, discussed, and, as, has, been, reported, it, was, an, idea, that, the, white, house, put, forward, on, february, 27, woodward, told, politico, that, before, the, column, was, published, woodward, had, called, a, senior, white, house, official, later, identified, by, reporters, as, economic, adviser, gene, sperling, to, discuss, the, piece, and, that, the, official, had, yelled, at, for, about, a, half, hour, before, sending, him, a, page, long, email, that, included, the, sentence, i, think, you, will, regret, staking, out, that, claim, in, politico, s, reporting, woodward, s, focus, on, that, line, was, described, as, making, clear, he, saw, as, a, veiled, threat, although, woodward, did, not, use, the, word, threat, or, threatened, several, other, sources, also, indicated, that, woodward, had, expressed, the, line, as, an, intended, threat, the, next, day, politico, published, the, complete, email, exchange, between, woodward, and, sperling, sperling, s, statements, leading, up, to, the, regret, line, read, but, i, do, truly, believe, you, should, rethink, your, comment, about, saying, that, potus, asking, for, revenues, is, moving, the, goal, post, i, know, you, may, not, believe, this, but, as, a, friend, i, think, you, will, regret, staking, out, that, claim, the, white, house, subsequently, released, a, statement, that, of, course, no, threat, was, intended, the, note, suggested, that, mr, woodward, would, regret, the, observation, he, made, regarding, the, sequester, because, that, observation, was, inaccurate, nothing, more, upon, release, of, the, emails, several, conservative, commentators, indicated, they, no, longer, agreed, with, characterizing, the, regret, statement, as, a, threat, in, a, february, 28, fox, news, channel, interview, woodward, said, he, had, never, used, the, word, threat, but, said, sperling, s, conduct, was, not, the, way, to, operate, in, a, white, house, he, also, said, i, ve, been, flooded, with, emails, from, people, in, the, press, saying, this, is, exactly, the, way, the, white, house, works, they, are, trying, to, control, and, they, don, t, want, to, be, challenged, or, crossed, national, journal, editor, ron,

overestimate, the, contributions, to, my, newspaper, and, to, my, time, as, editor, of, that, extraordinary, reporter, bob, woodward, surely, the, best, of, his, generation, at, investigative, reporting, the, best, i, ve, ever, seen, and, woodward, has, maintained, the, same, position, on, top, of, journalism, s, ladder, ever, since, watergate, in, 1995, woodward, also, received, the, golden, plate, award, of, the, american, academy, of, achievement, david, gergen, who, had, worked, in, the, white, house, during, the, richard, nixon, and, three, subsequent, administrations, said, in, his, 2000, memoir, eyewitness, to, power, of, woodward, s, reporting, i, don, t, accept, everything, he, writes, as, gospel, he, can, get, details, wrong, but, generally, his, accounts, in, both, his, books, and, in, the, post, are, remarkably, reliable, and, demand, serious, attention, i, am, convinced, he, writes, only, what, he, believes, to, be, true, or, has, been, reliably, told, to, be, true, and, he, is, certainly, a, force, for, keeping, the, government, honest, in, 2001, woodward, won, the, walter, cronkite, award, for, excellence, in, journalism, fred, barnes, of, the, weekly,

gates, former, director, of, the, cia, and, secretary, of, defense, said, that, he, wished, he, d, recruited, woodward, into, the, cia, saying, he, has, an, extraordinary, ability, to, get, otherwise, responsible, adults, to, spill, guts, to, him, his, ability, to, get, people, to, talk, about, stuff, they, shouldn, t, be, talking, about, is, just, extraordinary, and, may, be, unique, woodward, often, uses, unnamed, sources, in, his, reporting, for, the, post, and, in, his, books, using, extensive, interviews, with, firsthand, witnesses, documents, meeting, notes, diaries, calendars, and, other, documentation, woodward, attempts, to, construct, a, seamless, narrative, of, events, most, often, told, through, the, eyes, of, the, key, participants, nicholas, von, hoffman, has, made, the, criticism, that, arrestingly, irrelevant, detail, is, used, while, michael, massing, believes, woodward, s, books, are, filled, with, long, at, times, tedious, passages, with, no, evident, direction, joan, didion, published, a, comprehensive, criticism, of, woodward, in, a, lengthy, september, 1996, essay, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, though, woodward, is, a, widely, trusted, reporter, even, an, american, icon, she, says, that, he, assembles, reams, of, often, irrelevant, detail, fails, to, draw, conclusions, and, make, judgments, measurable, cerebral, activity, is, virtually, absent, from, his, books, after, watergate, from, 1979, to, 1996, she, said, she, said, the, books, are, notable, for, a, scrupulous, passivity, an, agreement, to, cover, the, story, not, as, it, is, occurring, but, as, it, is, presented, which, is, to, say, as, it, is, manufactured, she, ridicules, fairness, as, a, familiar, newsroom, piety, the, excuse, in, practice, for, a, good, deal, of, autopilot, reporting, and, lazy, thinking, all, this, focus, on, what, people, said, and, thought, their, decent, intentions, circumscribes, possible, discussion, or, speculation, resulting, in, what, she, called, political, pornography, the, post, s, richard, harwood, defended, woodward, in, a, september, 6, 1996, column, arguing, that, woodward, s, method, is, that, of, a, reporter, talking, to, people, you, write, about, checking, and, cross, checking, their, versions, of, contemporary, history, and, collecting, documentary, evidence, in, notes, letters, and, records, commentator, david, frum, has, said, that, washington, officials, can, learn, something, about, the, way, washington, works, from, woodward, s, books, from, his, books, you, can, draw, a, composite, profile, of, the, powerful, washington, player, that, person, is, highly, circumspect, highly, risk, averse, eschews, new, ideas, flatters, his, colleagues, to, their, face, while, trashing, them, to, woodward, behind, their, backs, and, is, always, careful, to, avoid, career, threatening, confrontation, we, all, admire, heroes, but, woodward, s, books, teach, us, that, those, who, rise, to, leadership, are, precisely, those, who, take, care, to, abjure, heroism, for, themselves, despite, these, criticisms, and, challenges, woodward, has, been, praised, as, an, authoritative, and, balanced, journalist, the, new, york, times, book, review, said, in, 2004, that, no, reporter, has, more, talent, for, getting, washington, s, inside, story, and, telling, it, cogently, as, of, 2008, woodward, was, giving, speeches, on, the, lecture, circuit, to, industry, lobbying, groups, such, as, the, american, bankruptcy, institute, the, national, association, of, chain, drug, stores, and, the, mortgage, bankers,
