harvard, massachusetts, in, may, 1843, for, what, would, become, fruitlands, a, community, based, on, utopian, ideals, inspired, in, part, by, transcendentalism, the, farm, would, run, based, on, a, communal, effort, using, no, animals, for, labor, its, participants, would, eat, no, meat, and, use, no, wool, or, leather, emerson, said, he, felt, sad, at, heart, for, not, engaging, in, the, experiment, himself, even, so, he, did, not, feel, fruitlands, would, be, a, success, their, whole, doctrine, is, spiritual, he, wrote, but, they, always, end, with, saying, give, us, much, land, and, money, even, alcott, admitted, he, was, not, prepared, for, the, difficulty, in, operating, fruitlands, none, of, us, were, prepared, to, actualize, practically, the, ideal, life, of, which, we, dreamed, so, we, fell, apart, he, wrote, after, its, failure, emerson, helped, buy, a, farm, for, alcott, s, family, in, concord, which, alcott, named, hillside, the, dial, ceased, publication, in,

name, emerson, made, a, living, as, a, popular, lecturer, in, new, england, and, much, of, the, rest, of, the, country, he, had, begun, lecturing, in, 1833, by, the, 1850s, he, was, giving, as, many, as, 80, lectures, per, year, he, addressed, the, boston, society, for, the, diffusion, of, useful, knowledge, and, the, gloucester, lyceum, among, others, emerson, spoke, on, a, wide, variety, of, subjects, and, many, of, his, essays, grew, out, of, his, lectures, he, charged, between, 10, and, 50, for, each, appearance, bringing, him, as, much, as, 2, 000, in, a, typical, winter, lecture, season, this, was, more, than, his, earnings, from, other, sources, in, some, years, he, earned, as, much, as, 900, for, a, series, of, six, lectures, and, in, another, for, a, winter, series, of, talks, in, boston, he, netted, 1, 600, he, eventually, gave, some, 1, 500, lectures, in, his, lifetime, his, earnings, allowed, him, to, expand, his, property, buying, 11, acres, 4, 5, ha, of, land, by, walden, pond, and, a, few, more, acres, in, a, neighboring, pine, grove, he, wrote, that, he, was, landlord, and, water, lord, of, 14, acres, more, or, less, emerson, was, introduced, to, indian, philosophy, through, the, works, of, the, french, philosopher, victor, cousin, in, 1845, emerson, s, journals, show, he, was, reading, the, bhagavad, gita, and, henry, thomas, colebrooke, s, essays, on, the, vedas, he, was, strongly, influenced, by, vedanta, and, much, of, his, writing, has, strong, shades, of, nondualism, one, of, the, clearest, examples, of, this, can, be, found, in, his, essay, the, over, soul, we, live, in, succession, in, division, in, parts, in, particles, meantime, within, man, is, the, soul, of, the, whole, the, wise, silence, the, universal, beauty, to, which, every, part, and, particle, is, equally, related, the, eternal, one, and, this, deep, power, in, which, we, exist, and, whose, beatitude, is, all, accessible, to, us, is, not, only, self, sufficing, and, perfect, in, every, hour, but, the, act, of, seeing, and, the, thing, seen, the, seer, and, the, spectacle, the, subject, and, the, object, are, one, we, see, the, world, piece, by, piece, as, the, sun, the, moon, the, animal, the, tree, but, the, whole, of, which, these, are, shining, parts, is, the, soul, the, central, message, emerson, drew, from, his, asian, studies, was, that, the,

between, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, and, the, bloody, june, days, when, he, arrived, he, saw, the, stumps, of, trees, that, had, been, cut, down, to, form, barricades, in, the, february, riots, on, may, 21, he, stood, on, the, champ, de, mars, in, the, midst, of, mass, celebrations, for, concord, peace, and, labor, he, wrote, in, his, journal, at, the, end, of, the, year, we, shall, take, account, see, if, the, revolution, was, worth, the, trees, the, trip, left, an, important, imprint, on, emerson, s, later, work, his, 1856, book, english, traits, is, based, largely, on, observations, recorded, in, his, travel, journals, and, notebooks, emerson, later, came, to, see, the, american, civil, war, as, a, revolution, that, shared, common, ground, with, the, european, revolutions, of, 1848, in, a, speech, in, concord, massachusetts, on, may, 3, 1851, emerson, denounced, the, fugitive, slave, act, the, act, of, congress, is, a, law, which, every, one, of, you, will, break, on, the, earliest, occasion, a, law, which, no, man, can, obey, or, abet, the, obeying, without, loss, of, self, respect, and, forfeiture, of, the, name, of, gentleman, that, summer, he, wrote, in, his, diary, this, filthy, enactment, was, made, in, the, nineteenth, century, by, people, who, could, read, and, write, i, will, not, obey, it, in, february, 1852, emerson, and, james, freeman, clarke, and, william, henry, channing, edited, an, edition, of, the, works, and, letters, of, margaret, fuller, who, had, died, in, 1850, within, a, week, of, her, death, her, new, york, editor, horace, greeley, suggested, to, emerson, that, a, biography, of, fuller, to, be, called, margaret, and, her, friends, be, prepared, quickly, before, the, interest, excited, by, her, sad, decease, has, passed, away, published, under, the, title, the, memoirs, of, margaret, fuller, ossoli, fuller, s, words, were, heavily, censored, or, rewritten, the, three, editors, were, not, concerned, about, accuracy, they, believed, public, interest, in, fuller, was, temporary, and, that, she, would, not, survive, as, a, historical, figure, even, so, it, was, the, best, selling, biography, of, the, decade, and, went, through, thirteen, editions, before, the, end, of, the, century, walt, whitman, published, the, innovative, poetry, collection, leaves, of, grass, in, 1855, and, sent, a, copy, to, emerson, for, his, opinion, emerson, responded, positively, sending, whitman, a, flattering, five, page, letter, in, response, emerson, s, approval, helped, the, first, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, stir, up, significant, interest, and, convinced, whitman, to, issue, a, second, edition, shortly, thereafter, this, edition, quoted, a, phrase, from, emerson, s, letter, printed, in, gold, leaf, on, the, cover, i, greet, you, at, the, beginning, of, a, great, career, emerson, took, offense, that, this, letter, was, made, public, and, later, was, more, critical, of, the, work, in, summer, 1858, emerson, camped, at, follensbee, pond, in, the, adirondack, mountains, in, upstate, new, york, with, nine, others, louis, agassiz, james, russell, lowell, john, holmes, horatio, woodman, ebenezer, rockwood, hoar, jeffries, wyman, estes, howe, amos, binney, and, william, james, stillman, invited, but, unable, to, make, the, trip, were, oliver, wendell, holmes, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, and, charles, eliot, norton, all, members, of, the, saturday, club, boston, massachusetts, this, social, club, was, mostly, a, literary, membership, that, met, the, last, saturday, of, the, month, at, the, boston, parker, house, hotel, omni, parker, house, william, james, stillman, was, a, painter, and, founding, editor, of, an, art, journal, called, the, crayon, stillman, was, born, and, grew, up, in, schenectady, which, was, just, south, of, the, adirondack, mountains, he, later, traveled, there, to, paint, the, wilderness, landscape, and, to, fish, and, hunt, he, shared, his, experiences, in, this, wilderness, to, the, members, of, the, saturday, club, raising, their, interest, in, this, unknown, region, james, russell, lowell, and, william, stillman, led, the, effort, to, organize, a, trip, to, the, adirondacks, they, began, their, journey, on, august, 2, 1858, traveling, by, train, steamboat, stagecoach, and, canoe, guide, boats, news, that, these, cultured, men, were, living, like, sacs, and, sioux, in, the, wilderness, appeared, in, newspapers, across, the, nation, this, became, known, as, the, philosophers, camp, this, event, was, a, landmark, in, the, nineteenth, century, intellectual, movement, linking, nature, with, art, and, literature, although, much, has, been, written, over, many, years, by, scholars, and, biographers, of, emerson, s, life, little, has, been, written, of, what, has, become, known, as, the, philosophers, camp, at, follensbee, pond, yet, his, epic, poem, adirondac, reads, like, a, journal, of, his, day, to, day, detailed, description, of, adventures, in, the, wilderness, with, his, fellow, members, of, the, saturday, club, this, two, week, camping, excursion, 1858, in, the, adirondacks, brought, him, face, to, face, with, a, true, wilderness, something, he, spoke, of, in, his, essay, nature, published, in, 1836, he, said, in, the, wilderness, i, find, something, more, dear, and, connate, than, in, streets, or, villages, emerson, was, staunchly, opposed, to, slavery, but, he, did, not, appreciate, being, in, the, public, limelight, and, was, hesitant, about, lecturing, on, the, subject, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, civil, war, he, did, give, a, number, of, lectures, however, beginning, as, early, as, november, 1837, a, number, of, his, friends, and, family, members, were, more, active, abolitionists, than, he, at, first, but, from, 1844, on, he, more, actively, opposed, slavery, he, gave, a, number, of, speeches, and, lectures, and, welcomed, john, brown, to, his, home, during, brown, s, visits, to, concord, he, voted, for, abraham, lincoln, in, 1860, but, was, disappointed, that, lincoln, was, more, concerned, about, preserving, the, union, than, eliminating, slavery, outright, once, the, american, civil, war, broke, out, emerson, made, it, clear, that, he, believed, in, immediate, emancipation, of, the, slaves, around, this, time, in, 1860, emerson, published, the, conduct, of, life, his, seventh, collection, of, essays, it, grappled, with, some, of, the, thorniest, issues, of, the, moment, and, his, experience, in, the, abolition, ranks, is, a, telling, influence, in, his, conclusions, in, these, essays, emerson, strongly, embraced, the, idea, of, war, as, a, means, of, national, rebirth, civil, war, national, bankruptcy, or, revolution, more, rich, in, the, central, tones, than, languid, years, of, prosperity, emerson, visited, washington, d, c, at, the, end, of, january, 1862, he, gave, a, public, lecture, at, the, smithsonian, on, january, 31, 1862, and, declared, the, south, calls, slavery, an, institution, i, call, it, destitution, emancipation, is, the, demand, of, civilization, the, next, day, february, 1, his, friend, charles, sumner, took, him, to, meet, lincoln, at, the, white, house, lincoln, was, familiar, with, emerson, s, work, having, previously, seen, him, lecture, emerson, s, misgivings, about, lincoln, began, to, soften, after, this, meeting, in, 1865, he, spoke, at, a, memorial, service, held, for, lincoln, in, concord, old, as, history, is, and, manifold, as, are, its, tragedies, i, doubt, if, any, death, has, caused, so, much, pain, as, this, has, caused, or, will, have, caused, on, its, announcement, emerson, also, met, a, number, of, high, ranking, government, officials, including, salmon, p, chase, the, secretary, of, the, treasury, edward, bates, the, attorney, general, edwin, m, stanton, the, secretary, of, war, gideon, welles, the, secretary, of, the, navy, and, william, seward, the, secretary, of, state, on, may, 6, 1862, emerson, s, prot, g, henry, david, thoreau, died, of, tuberculosis, at, the, age, of, 44, emerson, delivered, his, eulogy, he, often, referred, to, thoreau, as, his, best, friend, despite, a, falling, out, that, began, in, 1849, after, thoreau, published, a, week, on, the, concord, and, merrimack, rivers, another, friend, nathaniel, hawthorne, died, two, years, after, thoreau, in, 1864, emerson, served, as, a, pallbearer, when, hawthorne, was, buried, in, concord, as, emerson, wrote, in, a, pomp, of, sunshine, and, verdure, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1864, in, 1867, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, starting, in, 1867, emerson, s, health, began, declining, he, wrote, much, less, in, his, journals, beginning, as, early, as, the, summer, of, 1871, or, in, the, spring, of, 1872, he, started, experiencing, memory, problems, and, suffered, from, aphasia, by, the, end, of, the, decade, he, forgot, his, own, name, at, times, and, if, asked, how, he, felt, would, respond, quite, well, i, have, lost, my, mental, faculties, but, am, perfectly, well, in, the, spring, of, 1871, emerson, took, a, trip, on, the, transcontinental, railroad, barely, two, years, after, its, completion, along, the, way, and, in, california, he, met, a, number, of, dignitaries, including, brigham, young, during, a, stopover, in, salt, lake, city, part, of, his, california, visit, included, a, trip, to, yosemite, and, while, there, he, met, a, young, and, unknown, john, muir, a, signature, event, in, muir, s, career, emerson, s, concord, home, caught, fire, on, july, 24, 1872, he, called, for, help, from, neighbors, and, giving, up, on, putting, out, the, flames, all, tried, to, save, as, many, objects, as, possible, the, fire, was, put, out, by, ephraim, bull, jr, the, one, armed, son, of, ephraim, wales, bull, donations, were, collected, by, friends, to, help, the, emersons, rebuild, including, 5, 000, gathered, by, francis, cabot, lowell, another, 10, 000, collected, by, lebaron, russell, briggs, and, a, personal, donation, of, 1, 000, from, george, bancroft, support, for, shelter, was, offered, as, well, though, the, emersons, ended, up, staying, with, family, at, the, old, manse, invitations, came, from, anne, lynch, botta, james, elliot, cabot, james, t, fields, and, annie, adams, fields, the, fire, marked, an, end, to, emerson, s, serious, lecturing, career, from, then, on, he, would, lecture, only, on, special, occasions, and, only, in, front, of, familiar, audiences, while, the, house, was, being, rebuilt, emerson, took, a, trip, to, england, continental, europe, and, egypt, he, left, on, october, 23, 1872, along, with, his, daughter, ellen, while, his, wife, lidian, spent, time, at, the, old, manse, and, with, friends, emerson, and, his, daughter, ellen, returned, to, the, united, states, on, the, ship, olympus, along, with, friend, charles, eliot, norton, on, april, 15, 1873, emerson, s, return, to, concord, was, celebrated, by, the, town, and, school, was, canceled, that, day, in, late, 1874, emerson, published, an, anthology, of, poetry, entitled, parnassus, which, included, poems, by, anna, laetitia, barbauld, julia, caroline, dorr, jean, ingelow, lucy, larcom, jones, very, as, well, as, thoreau, and, several, others, originally, the, anthology, had, been, prepared, as, early, as, the, fall, of, 1871, but, it, was, delayed, when, the, publishers, asked, for, revisions, the, problems, with, his, memory, had, become, embarrassing, to, emerson, and, he, ceased, his, public, appearances, by, 1879, in, reply, to, an, invitation, to, a, retirement, celebration, for, octavius, b, frothingham, he, wrote, i, am, not, in, condition, to, make, visits, or, take, any, part, in, conversation, old, age, has, rushed, on, me, in, the, last, year, and, tied, my, tongue, and, hid, my, memory, and, thus, made, it, a, duty, to, stay, at, home, the, new, york, times, quoted, his, reply, and, noted, that, his, regrets, were, read, aloud, at, the, celebration, holmes, wrote, of, the, problem, saying, emerson, is, afraid, to, trust, himself, in, society, much, on, account, of, the, failure, of, his, memory, and, the, great, difficulty, he, finds, in, getting, the, words, he, wants, it, is, painful, to, witness, his, embarrassment, at, times, on, april, 21, 1882, emerson, was, found, to, be, suffering, from, pneumonia, he, died, six, days, later, emerson, is, buried, in, sleepy, hollow, cemetery, concord, massachusetts, he, was, placed, in, his, coffin, wearing, a, white, robe, given, by, the, american, sculptor, daniel, chester, french, emerson, s, religious, views, were, often, considered, radical, at, the, time, he, believed, that, all, things, are, connected, to, god, and, therefore, all, things, are, divine, critics, believed, that, emerson, was, removing, the, central, god, figure, as, henry, ware, jr, said, emerson, was, in, danger, of, taking, away, the, father, of, the, universe, and, leaving, but, a, company, of, children, in, an, orphan, asylum, emerson, was, partly, influenced, by, german, philosophy, and, biblical, criticism, his, views, the, basis, of, transcendentalism, suggested, that, god, does, not, have, to, reveal, the, truth, but, that, the, truth, could, be, intuitively, experienced, directly, from, nature, when, asked, his, religious, belief, emerson, stated, i, am, more, of, a, quaker, than, anything, else, i, believe, in, the, still, small, voice, and, that, voice, is, christ, within, us, emerson, was, a, supporter, of, the, spread, of, community, libraries, in, the, 19th, century, having, this, to, say, of, them, consider, what, you, have, in, the, smallest, chosen, library, a, company, of, the, wisest, and, wittiest, men, that, could, be, picked, out, of, all, civil, countries, in, a, thousand, years, have, set, in, best, order, the, results, of, their, learning, and, wisdom, emerson, had, romantic, interest, in, various, women, throughout, his, life, including, anna, barker, and, caroline, sturgis, emerson, did, not, become, an, ardent, abolitionist, until, 1844, though, his, journals, show, he, was, concerned, with, slavery, beginning, in, his, youth, even, dreaming, about, helping, to, free, slaves, in, june, 1856, shortly, after, charles, sumner, a, united, states, senator, was, beaten, for, his, staunch, abolitionist, views, emerson, lamented, that, he, himself, was, not, as, committed, to, the, cause, he, wrote, there, are, men, who, as, soon, as, they, are, born, take, a, bee, line, to, the, axe, of, the, inquisitor, wonderful, the, way, in, which, we, are, saved, by, this, unfailing, supply, of, the, moral, element, after, sumner, s, attack, emerson, began, to, speak, out, about, slavery, i, think, we, must, get, rid, of, slavery, or, we, must, get, rid, of, freedom, he, said, at, a, meeting, at, concord, that, summer, emerson, used, slavery, as, an, example, of, a, human, injustice, especially, in, his, role, as, a, minister, in, early, 1838, provoked, by, the, murder, of, an, abolitionist, publisher, from, alton, illinois, named, elijah, parish, lovejoy, emerson, gave, his, first, public, antislavery, address, as, he, said, it, is, but, the, other, day, that, the, brave, lovejoy, gave, his, breast, to, the, bullets, of, a, mob, for, the, rights, of, free, speech, and, opinion, and, died, when, it, was, better, not, to, live, john, quincy, adams, said, the, mob, murder, of, lovejoy, sent, a, shock, as, of, any, earthquake, throughout, this, continent, however, emerson, maintained, that, reform, would, be, achieved, through, moral, agreement, rather, than, by, militant, action, by, august, 1, 1844, at, a, lecture, in, concord, he, stated, more, clearly, his, support, for, the, abolitionist, movement, we, are, indebted, mainly, to, this, movement, and, to, the, continuers, of, it, for, the, popular, discussion, of, every, point, of, practical, ethics, emerson, is, often, known, as, one, of, the, most, liberal, democratic, thinkers, of, his, time, who, believed, that, through, the, democratic, process, slavery, should, be, abolished, while, being, an, avid, abolitionist, who, was, known, for, his, criticism, of, the, legality, of, slavery, emerson, struggled, with, the, implications, of, race, his, usual, liberal, leanings, did, not, clearly, translate, when, it, came, to, believing, that, all, races, had, equal, capability, or, function, which, was, a, common, conception, for, the, period, in, which, he, lived, many, critics, believe, that, it, was, his, views, on, race, that, inhibited, him, from, becoming, an, abolitionist, earlier, in, his, life, and, also, inhibited, him, from, being, more, active, in, the, antislavery, movement, much, of, his, early, life, he, was, silent, on, the, topic, of, race, and, slavery, not, until, he, was, well, into, his, 30s, did, emerson, begin, to, publish, writings, on, race, and, slavery, and, not, until, he, was, in, his, late, 40s, and, 50s, did, he, become, known, as, an, antislavery, activist, during, his, early, life, emerson, seemed, to, develop, a, hierarchy, of, races, based, on, faculty, to, reason, or, rather, whether, african, slaves, were, distinguishably, equal, to, white, men, based, on, their, ability, to, reason, in, a, journal, entry, written, in, 1822, emerson, wrote, about, a, personal, observation, it, can, hardly, be, true, that, the, difference, lies, in, the, attribute, of, reason, i, saw, ten, twenty, a, hundred, large, lipped, lowbrowed, black, men, in, the, streets, who, except, in, the, mere, matter, of, language, did, not, exceed, the, sagacity, of, the, elephant, now, is, it, true, that, these, were, created, superior, to, this, wise, animal, and, designed, to, control, it, and, in, comparison, with, the, highest, orders, of, men, the, africans, will, stand, so, low, as, to, make, the, difference, which, subsists, between, themselves, the, sagacious, beasts, inconsiderable, as, with, many, supporters, of, slavery, during, his, early, years, emerson, seems, to, have, thought, that, the, faculties, of, african, slaves, were, not, equal, to, those, of, white, slave, owners, but, this, belief, in, racial, inferiorities, did, not, make, emerson, a, supporter, of, slavery, emerson, wrote, later, that, year, that, no, ingenious, sophistry, can, ever, reconcile, the, unperverted, mind, to, the, pardon, of, slavery, nothing, but, tremendous, familiarity, and, the, bias, of, private, interest, emerson, saw, the, removal, of, people, from, their, homeland, the, treatment, of, slaves, and, the, self, seeking, benefactors, of, slaves, as, gross, injustices, for, emerson, slavery, was, a, moral, issue, while, superiority, of, the, races, was, an, issue, he, tried, to, analyze, from, a, scientific, perspective, based, on, what, he, believed, to, be, inherited, traits, emerson, saw, himself, as, a, man, of, saxon, descent, in, a, speech, given, in, 1835, titled, permanent, traits, of, the, english, national, genius, he, said, the, inhabitants, of, the, united, states, especially, of, the, northern, portion, are, descended, from, the, people, of, england, and, have, inherited, the, traits, of, their, national, character, he, saw, direct, ties, between, race, based, on, national, identity, and, the, inherent, nature, of, the, human, being, white, americans, who, were, native, born, in, the, united, states, and, of, english, ancestry, were, categorized, by, him, as, a, separate, race, which, he, thought, had, a, position, of, being, superior, to, other, nations, his, idea, of, race, was, based, on, a, shared, culture, environment, and, history, he, believed, that, native, born, americans, of, english, descent, were, superior, to, european, immigrants, including, the, irish, french, and, germans, and, also, as, being, superior, to, english, people, from, england, whom, he, considered, a, close, second, and, the, only, really, comparable, group, later, in, his, life, emerson, s, ideas, on, race, changed, when, he, became, more, involved, in, the, abolitionist, movement, while, at, the, same, time, he, began, to, more, thoroughly, analyze, the, philosophical, implications, of, race, and, racial, hierarchies, his, beliefs, shifted, focus, to, the, potential, outcomes, of, racial, conflicts, emerson, s, racial, views, were, closely, related, to, his, views, on, nationalism, and, national, superiority, which, was, a, common, view, in, the, united, states, at, that, time, emerson, used, contemporary, theories, of, race, and, natural, science, to, support, a, theory, of, race, development, he, believed, that, the, current, political, battle, and, the, current, enslavement, of, other, races, was, an, inevitable, racial, struggle, one, that, would, result, in, the, inevitable, union, of, the, united, states, such, conflicts, were, necessary, for, the, dialectic, of, change, that, would, eventually, allow, the, progress, of, the, nation, in, much, of, his, later, work, emerson, seems, to, allow, the, notion, that, different, european, races, will, eventually, mix, in, america, this, hybridization, process, would, lead, to, a, superior, race, that, would, be, to, the, advantage, of, the, superiority, of, the, united, states, as, a, lecturer, and, orator, emerson, nicknamed, the, sage, of, concord, became, the, leading, voice, of, intellectual, culture, in, the, united, states, james, russell, lowell, editor, of, the, atlantic, monthly, and, the, north, american, review, commented, in, his, book, my, study, windows, 1871, that, emerson, was, not, only, the, most, steadily, attractive, lecturer, in, america, but, also, one, of, the, pioneers, of, the, lecturing, system, herman, melville, who, had, met, emerson, in, 1849, originally, thought, he, had, a, defect, in, the, region, of, the, heart, and, a, self, conceit, so, intensely, intellectual, that, at, first, one, hesitates, to, call, it, by, its, right, name, though, he, later, admitted, emerson, was, a, great, man, theodore, parker, a, minister, and, transcendentalist, noted, emerson, s, ability, to, influence, and, inspire, others, the, brilliant, genius, of, emerson, rose, in, the, winter, nights, and, hung, over, boston, drawing, the, eyes, of, ingenuous, young, people, to, look, up, to, that, great, new, star, a, beauty, and, a, mystery, which, charmed, for, the, moment, while, it, gave, also, perennial, inspiration, as, it, led, them, forward, along, new, paths, and, towards, new, hopes, emerson, s, work, not, only, influenced, his, contemporaries, such, as, walt, whitman, and, henry, david, thoreau, but, would, continue, to, influence, thinkers, and, writers, in, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, down, to, the, present, notable, thinkers, who, recognize, emerson, s, influence, include, nietzsche, and, william, james, emerson, s, godson, there, is, little, disagreement, that, emerson, was, the, most, influential, writer, of, 19th, century, america, though, these, days, he, is, largely, the, concern, of, scholars, walt, whitman, henry, david, thoreau, and, william, james, were, all, positive, emersonians, while, herman, melville, nathaniel, hawthorne, and, henry, james, were, emersonians, in, denial, while, they, set, themselves, in, opposition, to, the, sage, there, was, no, escaping, his, influence, to, t, s, eliot, emerson, s, essays, were, an, encumbrance, waldo, the, sage, was, eclipsed, from, 1914, until, 1965, when, he, returned, to, shine, after, surviving, in, the, work, of, major, american, poets, like, robert, frost, wallace, stevens, and, hart, crane, in, his, book, the, american, religion, harold, bloom, repeatedly, refers, to, emerson, as, the, prophet, of, the, american, religion, which, in, the, context, of, the, book, refers, to, indigenously, american, religions, such, as, mormonism, and, christian, science, which, arose, largely, in, emerson, s, lifetime, but, also, to, mainline, protestant, churches, that, bloom, says, have, become, in, the, united, states, more, gnostic, than, their, european, counterparts, in, the, western, canon, bloom, compares, emerson, to, michel, de, montaigne, the, only, equivalent, reading, experience, that, i, know, is, to, reread, endlessly, in, the, notebooks, and, journals, of, ralph, waldo, emerson, the, american, version, of, montaigne,
