thomas, alva, edison, february, 11, 1847, october, 18, 1931, was, an, american, inventor, and, businessman, he, developed, many, devices, in, fields, such, as, electric, power, generation, mass, communication, sound, recording, and, motion, pictures, these, inventions, which, include, the, phonograph, the, motion, picture, camera, and, early, versions, of, the, electric, light, bulb, have, had, a, widespread, impact, on, the, modern, industrialized, world, he, was, one, of, the, first, inventors, to, apply, the, principles, of, organized, science, and, teamwork, to, the, process, of, invention, working, with, many, researchers, and, employees, he, established, the, first, industrial, research, laboratory, edison, was, raised, in, the, american, midwest, early, in, his, career, he, worked, as, a, telegraph, operator, which, inspired, some, of, his, earliest, inventions, in, 1876, he, established, his, first, laboratory, facility, in, menlo, park, new, jersey, where, many, of, his, early, inventions, were, developed, he, later, established, a, botanical, laboratory, in, fort, myers, florida, in, collaboration, with, businessmen, henry, ford, and, harvey, s, firestone, and, a, laboratory, in, west, orange, new, jersey, that, featured, the, world, s, first, film, studio, the, black, maria, with, 1, 093, us, patents, in, his, name, as, well, as, patents, in, other, countries, edison, is, regarded, as, the, most, prolific, inventor, in, american, history, edison, married, twice, and, fathered, six, children, he, died, in, 1931, due, to, complications, from, diabetes, thomas, edison, was, born, in, 1847, in, milan, ohio, but, grew, up, in, port, huron, michigan, after, the, family, moved, there, in, 1854, he, was, the, seventh, and, last, child, of, samuel, ogden, edison, jr, 1804, 1896, born, in, marshalltown, nova, scotia, and, nancy, matthews, elliott, 1810, 1871, born, in, chenango, county, new, york, his, patrilineal, family, line, was, dutch, by, way, of, new, jersey, the, surname, had, originally, been, edeson, his, great, grandfather, loyalist, john, edeson, fled, new, jersey, for, nova, scotia, in, 1784, the, family, moved, to, middlesex, county, upper, canada, around, 1811, and, his, grandfather, capt, samuel, edison, sr, served, with, the, 1st, middlesex, militia, during, the, war, of, 1812, his, father, samuel, edison, jr, moved, to, vienna, ontario, and, fled, to, ohio, after, his, involvement, in, the, rebellion, of, 1837, edison, was, taught, reading, writing, and, arithmetic, by, his, mother, a, former, school, teacher, he, attended, school, for, only, a, few, months, however, one, biographer, described, him, as, a, very, curious, child, who, learned, most, things, by, reading, on, his, own, as, a, child, he, became, fascinated, with, technology, and, spent, hours, working, on, experiments, at, home, edison, developed, hearing, problems, at, the, age, of, 12, the, cause, of, his, deafness, has, been, attributed, to, a, bout, of, scarlet, fever, during, childhood, and, recurring, untreated, middle, ear, infections, he, subsequently, concocted, elaborate, fictitious, stories, about, the, cause, of, his, deafness, he, was, completely, deaf, in, one, ear, and, barely, hearing, in, the, other, it, is, alleged, that, edison, would, listen, to, a, music, player, or, piano, by, clamping, his, teeth, into, the, wood, to, absorb, the, sound, waves, into, his, skull, as, he, got, older, edison, believed, his, hearing, loss, allowed, him, to, avoid, distraction, and, concentrate, more, easily, on, his, work, modern, day, historians, and, medical, professionals, have, suggested, he, may, have, had, adhd, it, is, known, that, early, in, his, career, he, enrolled, in, a, chemistry, course, at, the, cooper, union, for, the, advancement, of, science, and, art, to, support, his, work, on, a, new, telegraphy, system, with, charles, batchelor, this, appears, to, have, been, his, only, enrollment, in, courses, at, an, institution, of, higher, learning, thomas, edison, began, his, career, as, a, news, butcher, selling, newspapers, candy, and, vegetables, on, trains, running, from, port, huron, to, detroit, he, turned, a, 50, a, week, profit, by, age, 13, most, of, which, went, to, buying, equipment, for, electrical, and, chemical, experiments, at, age, 15, in, 1862, he, saved, 3, year, old, jimmie, mackenzie, from, being, struck, by, a, runaway, train, jimmie, s, father, station, agent, j, u, mackenzie, of, mount, clemens, michigan, was, so, grateful, that, he, trained, edison, as, a, telegraph, operator, edison, s, first, telegraphy, job, away, from, port, huron, was, at, stratford, junction, ontario, on, the, grand, trunk, railway, he, also, studied, qualitative, analysis, and, conducted, chemical, experiments, until, he, left, the, job, rather, than, be, fired, after, being, held, responsible, for, a, near, collision, of, two, trains, edison, obtained, the, exclusive, right, to, sell, newspapers, on, the, road, and, with, the, aid, of, four, assistants, he, set, in, type, and, printed, the, grand, trunk, herald, which, he, sold, with, his, other, papers, this, began, edison, s, long, streak, of, entrepreneurial, ventures, as, he, discovered, his, talents, as, a, businessman, ultimately, his, entrepreneurship, was, central, to, the, formation, of, some, 14, companies, including, general, electric, formerly, one, of, the, largest, publicly, traded, companies, in, the, world, in, 1866, at, the, age, of, 19, edison, moved, to, louisville, kentucky, where, as, an, employee, of, western, union, he, worked, the, associated, press, bureau, news, wire, edison, requested, the, night, shift, which, allowed, him, plenty, of, time, to, spend, at, his, two, favorite, pastimes, reading, and, experimenting, eventually, the, latter, pre, occupation, cost, him, his, job, one, night, in, 1867, he, was, working, with, a, lead, acid, battery, when, he, spilt, sulfuric, acid, onto, the, floor, it, ran, between, the, floorboards, and, onto, his, boss, s, desk, below, the, next, morning, edison, was, fired, his, first, patent, was, for, the, electric, vote, recorder, u, s, patent, 90, 646, which, was, granted, on, june, 1, 1869, finding, little, demand, for, the, machine, edison, moved, to, new, york, city, shortly, thereafter, one, of, his, mentors, during, those, early, years, was, a, fellow, telegrapher, and, inventor, named, franklin, leonard, pope, who, allowed, the, impoverished, youth, to, live, and, work, in, the, basement, of, his, elizabeth, new, jersey, home, while, edison, worked, for, samuel, laws, at, the, gold, indicator, company, pope, and, edison, founded, their, own, company, in, october, 1869, working, as, electrical, engineers, and, inventors, edison, began, developing, a, multiplex, telegraphic, system, which, could, send, two, messages, simultaneously, in, 1874, edison, s, major, innovation, was, the, establishment, of, an, industrial, research, lab, in, 1876, it, was, built, in, menlo, park, a, part, of, raritan, township, now, named, edison, township, in, his, honor, in, middlesex, county, new, jersey, with, the, funds, from, the, sale, of, edison, s, quadruplex, telegraph, after, his, demonstration, of, the, telegraph, edison, was, not, sure, that, his, original, plan, to, sell, it, for, 4, 000, to, 5, 000, was, right, so, he, asked, western, union, to, make, a, bid, he, was, surprised, to, hear, them, offer, 10, 000, 269, 294, in, 2023, which, he, gratefully, accepted, the, quadruplex, telegraph, was, edison, s, first, big, financial, success, and, menlo, park, became, the, first, institution, set, up, with, the, specific, purpose, of, producing, constant, technological, innovation, and, improvement, edison, was, legally, credited, with, most, of, the, inventions, produced, there, though, many, employees, carried, out, research, and, development, under, his, direction, his, staff, was, generally, told, to, carry, out, his, directions, in, conducting, research, and, he, drove, them, hard, to, produce, results, william, joseph, hammer, a, consulting, electrical, engineer, started, working, for, edison, and, began, his, duties, as, a, laboratory, assistant, in, december, 1879, he, assisted, in, experiments, on, the, telephone, phonograph, electric, railway, iron, ore, separator, electric, lighting, and, other, developing, inventions, however, hammer, worked, primarily, on, the, incandescent, electric, lamp, and, was, put, in, charge, of, tests, and, records, on, that, device, in, 1880, he, was, appointed, chief, engineer, of, the, edison, lamp, works, in, his, first, year, the, plant, under, general, manager, francis, robbins, upton, turned, out, 50, 000, lamps, according, to, edison, hammer, was, a, pioneer, of, incandescent, electric, lighting, frank, j, sprague, a, competent, mathematician, and, former, naval, officer, was, recruited, by, edward, h, johnson, and, joined, the, edison, organization, in, 1883, one, of, sprague, s, contributions, to, the, edison, laboratory, at, menlo, park, was, to, expand, edison, s, mathematical, methods, despite, the, common, belief, that, edison, did, not, use, mathematics, analysis, of, his, notebooks, reveal, that, he, was, an, astute, user, of, mathematical, analysis, conducted, by, his, assistants, such, as, francis, robbins, upton, for, example, determining, the, critical, parameters, of, his, electric, lighting, system, including, lamp, resistance, by, an, analysis, of, ohm, s, law, joule, s, law, and, economics, nearly, all, of, edison, s, patents, were, utility, patents, which, were, protected, for, 17, years, and, included, inventions, or, processes, that, are, electrical, mechanical, or, chemical, in, nature, about, a, dozen, were, design, patents, which, protect, an, ornamental, design, for, up, to, 14, years, as, in, most, patents, the, inventions, he, described, were, improvements, over, prior, art, the, phonograph, patent, in, contrast, was, unprecedented, in, describing, the, first, device, to, record, and, reproduce, sounds, in, just, over, a, decade, edison, s, menlo, park, laboratory, had, expanded, to, occupy, two, city, blocks, edison, said, he, wanted, the, lab, to, have, a, stock, of, almost, every, conceivable, material, a, newspaper, article, printed, in, 1887, reveals, the, seriousness, of, his, claim, stating, the, lab, contained, eight, thousand, kinds, of, chemicals, every, kind, of, screw, made, every, size, of, needle, every, kind, of, cord, or, wire, hair, of, humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels, silk, in, every, texture, cocoons, various, kinds, of, hoofs, shark, s, teeth, deer, horns, tortoise, shell, cork, resin, varnish, and, oil, ostrich, feathers, a, peacock, s, tail, jet, amber, rubber, all, ores, and, the, list, goes, on, over, his, desk, edison, displayed, a, placard, with, sir, joshua, reynolds, famous, quotation, there, is, no, expedient, to, which, a, man, will, not, resort, to, avoid, the, real, labor, of, thinking, this, slogan, was, reputedly, posted, at, several, other, locations, throughout, the, facility, in, menlo, park, edison, had, created, the, first, industrial, laboratory, concerned, with, creating, knowledge, and, then, controlling, its, application, edison, s, name, is, registered, on, 1, 093, patents, edison, began, his, career, as, an, inventor, in, newark, new, jersey, with, the, automatic, repeater, and, his, other, improved, telegraphic, devices, but, the, invention, that, first, gained, him, wider, notice, was, the, phonograph, in, 1877, this, accomplishment, was, so, unexpected, by, the, public, at, large, as, to, appear, almost, magical, edison, became, known, as, the, wizard, of, menlo, park, his, first, phonograph, recorded, on, tinfoil, around, a, grooved, cylinder, despite, its, limited, sound, quality, and, that, the, recordings, could, be, played, only, a, few, times, the, phonograph, made, edison, a, celebrity, joseph, henry, president, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, and, one, of, the, most, renowned, electrical, scientists, in, the, us, described, edison, as, the, most, ingenious, inventor, in, this, country, or, in, any, other, in, april, 1878, edison, traveled, to, washington, to, demonstrate, the, phonograph, before, the, national, academy, of, sciences, congressmen, senators, and, president, hayes, the, washington, post, described, edison, as, a, genius, and, his, presentation, as, a, scene, that, will, live, in, history, although, edison, obtained, a, patent, for, the, phonograph, in, 1878, he, did, little, to, develop, it, until, alexander, graham, bell, chichester, bell, and, charles, tainter, produced, a, phonograph, like, device, in, the, 1880s, that, used, wax, coated, cardboard, cylinders, in, 1876, edison, began, work, to, improve, the, microphone, for, telephones, at, that, time, called, a, transmitter, by, developing, a, carbon, microphone, which, consists, of, two, metal, plates, separated, by, granules, of, carbon, that, would, change, resistance, with, the, pressure, of, sound, waves, a, steady, direct, current, is, passed, between, the, plates, through, the, granules, and, the, varying, resistance, results, in, a, modulation, of, the, current, creating, a, varying, electric, current, that, reproduces, the, varying, pressure, of, the, sound, wave, up, to, that, point, microphones, such, as, the, ones, developed, by, johann, philipp, reis, and, alexander, graham, bell, worked, by, generating, a, weak, current, the, carbon, microphone, works, by, modulating, a, direct, current, and, subsequently, using, a, transformer, to, transfer, the, signal, so, generated, to, the, telephone, line, edison, was, one, of, many, inventors, working, on, the, problem, of, creating, a, usable, microphone, for, telephony, by, having, it, modulate, an, electric, current, passed, through, it, his, work, was, concurrent, with, emile, berliner, s, loose, contact, carbon, transmitter, who, lost, a, later, patent, case, against, edison, over, the, carbon, transmitter, s, invention, and, david, edward, hughes, study, and, published, paper, on, the, physics, of, loose, contact, carbon, transmitters, work, that, hughes, did, not, bother, to, patent, edison, used, the, carbon, microphone, concept, in, 1877, to, create, an, improved, telephone, for, western, union, in, 1886, edison, found, a, way, to, improve, a, bell, telephone, microphone, one, that, used, loose, contact, ground, carbon, with, his, discovery, that, it, worked, far, better, if, the, carbon, was, roasted, this, type, was, put, in, use, in, 1890, and, was, used, in, all, telephones, along, with, the, bell, receiver, until, the, 1980s, in, 1878, edison, began, working, on, a, system, of, electrical, illumination, something, he, hoped, could, compete, with, gas, and, oil, based, lighting, he, began, by, tackling, the, problem, of, creating, a, long, lasting, incandescent, lamp, something, that, would, be, needed, for, indoor, use, however, thomas, edison, did, not, invent, the, light, bulb, in, 1840, british, scientist, warren, de, la, rue, developed, an, efficient, light, bulb, using, a, coiled, platinum, filament, but, the, high, cost, of, platinum, kept, the, bulb, from, becoming, a, commercial, success, many, other, inventors, had, also, devised, incandescent, lamps, including, alessandro, volta, s, demonstration, of, a, glowing, wire, in, 1800, and, inventions, by, henry, woodward, and, mathew, evans, others, who, developed, early, and, commercially, impractical, incandescent, electric, lamps, included, humphry, davy, james, bowman, lindsay, moses, g, farmer, william, e, sawyer, joseph, swan, and, heinrich, g, bel, these, early, bulbs, all, had, flaws, such, as, an, extremely, short, life, and, requiring, a, high, electric, current, to, operate, which, made, them, difficult, to, apply, on, a, large, scale, commercially, 217, 218, in, his, first, attempts, to, solve, these, problems, edison, tried, using, a, filament, made, of, cardboard, carbonized, with, compressed, lampblack, this, burnt, out, too, quickly, to, provide, lasting, light, he, then, experimented, with, different, grasses, and, canes, such, as, hemp, and, palmetto, before, settling, on, bamboo, as, the, best, filament, edison, continued, trying, to, improve, this, design, and, on, november, 4, 1879, filed, for, u, s, patent, 223, 898, granted, on, january, 27, 1880, for, an, electric, lamp, using, a, carbon, filament, or, strip, coiled, and, connected, to, platina, contact, wires, the, patent, described, several, ways, of, creating, the, carbon, filament, including, cotton, and, linen, thread, wood, splints, papers, coiled, in, various, ways, it, was, not, until, several, months, after, the, patent, was, granted, that, edison, and, his, team, discovered, that, a, carbonized, bamboo, filament, could, last, over, 1, 200, hours, attempts, to, prevent, blackening, of, the, bulb, due, to, emission, of, charged, carbon, from, the, hot, filament, culminated, in, edison, effect, bulbs, which, redirected, and, controlled, the, mysterious, unidirectional, current, edison, s, 1883, patent, for, voltage, regulating, is, notably, the, first, us, patent, for, an, electronic, device, due, to, its, use, of, an, edison, effect, bulb, as, an, active, component, subsequent, scientists, studied, applied, and, eventually, evolved, the, bulbs, into, vacuum, tubes, a, core, component, of, early, analog, and, digital, electronics, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1878, edison, formed, the, edison, electric, light, company, in, new, york, city, with, several, financiers, including, j, p, morgan, spencer, trask, and, the, members, of, the, vanderbilt, family, edison, made, the, first, public, demonstration, of, his, incandescent, light, bulb, on, december, 31, 1879, in, menlo, park, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, said, we, will, make, electricity, so, cheap, that, only, the, rich, will, burn, candles, henry, villard, president, of, the, oregon, railroad, and, navigation, company, attended, edison, s, 1879, demonstration, villard, was, impressed, and, requested, edison, install, his, electric, lighting, system, aboard, villard, s, company, s, new, steamer, the, columbia, although, hesitant, at, first, edison, agreed, to, villard, s, request, most, of, the, work, was, completed, in, may, 1880, and, the, columbia, went, to, new, york, city, where, edison, and, his, personnel, installed, columbia, s, new, lighting, system, the, columbia, was, edison, s, first, commercial, application, for, his, incandescent, light, bulb, the, edison, equipment, was, removed, from, columbia, in, 1895, in, 1880, lewis, latimer, a, draftsman, and, an, expert, witness, in, patent, litigation, began, working, for, the, united, states, electric, lighting, company, run, by, edison, s, rival, hiram, s, maxim, while, working, for, maxim, latimer, invented, a, process, for, making, carbon, filaments, for, light, bulbs, and, helped, install, broad, scale, lighting, systems, for, new, york, city, philadelphia, montreal, and, london, latimer, holds, the, patent, for, the, electric, lamp, issued, in, 1881, and, a, second, patent, for, the, process, of, manufacturing, carbons, the, filament, used, in, incandescent, light, bulbs, issued, in, 1882, on, october, 8, 1883, the, us, patent, office, ruled, that, edison, s, patent, was, based, on, the, work, of, william, e, sawyer, and, was, therefore, invalid, litigation, continued, for, nearly, six, years, in, 1885, latimer, switched, camps, and, started, working, with, edison, on, october, 6, 1889, a, judge, ruled, that, edison, s, electric, light, improvement, claim, for, a, filament, of, carbon, of, high, resistance, was, valid, to, avoid, a, possible, court, battle, with, yet, another, competitor, joseph, swan, who, held, an, 1880, british, patent, on, a, similar, incandescent, electric, lamp, he, and, swan, formed, a, joint, company, called, ediswan, to, manufacture, and, market, the, invention, in, britain, the, incandescent, light, bulb, patented, by, edison, also, began, to, gain, widespread, popularity, in, europe, as, well, mahen, theatre, in, brno, in, what, is, now, the, czech, republic, opened, in, 1882, and, was, the, first, public, building, in, the, world, to, use, edison, s, electric, lamps, francis, jehl, edison, s, assistant, in, the, invention, of, the, lamp, supervised, the, installation, in, september, 2010, a, sculpture, of, three, giant, light, bulbs, was, erected, in, brno, in, front, of, the, theater, the, first, edison, light, bulbs, in, the, nordic, countries, were, installed, at, the, weaving, hall, of, the, finlayson, s, textile, factory, in, tampere, finland, in, march, 1882, in, 1901, edison, attended, the, pan, american, exposition, in, buffalo, new, york, his, company, the, edison, manufacturing, company, was, given, the, task, of, installing, the, electric, lights, on, the, various, buildings, and, structures, that, were, built, for, the, exposition, at, night, edison, made, a, panorama, photograph, of, the, illuminated, buildings, after, devising, a, commercially, viable, electric, light, bulb, on, october, 21, 1879, edison, developed, an, electric, utility, to, compete, with, the, existing, gas, light, utilities, on, december, 17, 1880, he, founded, the, edison, illuminating, company, and, during, the, 1880s, he, patented, a, system, for, electricity, distribution, the, company, established, the, first, investor, owned, electric, utility, on, september, 4, 1882, in, pearl, street, new, york, city, his, 600, kw, cogeneration, steam, powered, generating, station, pearl, street, station, s, electrical, power, distribution, system, was, switched, on, providing, 110, volts, direct, current, dc, initially, to, 59, customers, in, lower, manhattan, quickly, growing, to, 508, customers, with, 10, 164, lamps, the, power, station, was, decommissioned, in, 1895, eight, months, earlier, in, january, 1882, to, demonstrate, feasibility, edison, had, switched, on, the, 93, kw, first, steam, generating, power, station, at, holborn, viaduct, in, london, this, was, a, smaller, 110, v, dc, supply, system, eventually, supplying, 3, 000, street, lights, and, a, number, of, nearby, private, dwellings, but, was, shut, down, in, september, 1886, as, uneconomic, since, he, was, unable, to, extend, the, premises, on, january, 19, 1883, the, first, standardized, incandescent, electric, lighting, system, employing, overhead, wires, began, service, in, roselle, new, jersey, as, edison, expanded, his, direct, current, dc, power, delivery, system, he, received, stiff, competition, from, companies, installing, alternating, current, ac, systems, from, the, early, 1880s, ac, arc, lighting, systems, for, streets, and, large, spaces, had, been, an, expanding, business, in, the, us, with, the, development, of, transformers, in, europe, and, by, westinghouse, electric, in, the, us, in, 1885, 1886, it, became, possible, to, transmit, ac, long, distances, over, thinner, and, cheaper, wires, and, step, down, reduce, the, voltage, at, the, destination, for, distribution, to, users, this, allowed, ac, to, be, used, in, street, lighting, and, in, lighting, for, small, business, and, domestic, customers, the, market, edison, s, patented, low, voltage, dc, incandescent, lamp, system, was, designed, to, supply, edison, s, dc, empire, suffered, from, one, of, its, chief, drawbacks, it, was, suitable, only, for, the, high, density, of, customers, found, in, large, cities, edison, s, dc, plants, could, not, deliver, electricity, to, customers, more, than, one, mile, from, the, plant, and, left, a, patchwork, of, unsupplied, customers, between, plants, small, cities, and, rural, areas, could, not, afford, an, edison, style, system, leaving, a, large, part, of, the, market, without, electrical, service, ac, companies, expanded, into, this, gap, edison, expressed, views, that, ac, was, unworkable, and, the, high, voltages, used, were, dangerous, as, george, westinghouse, installed, his, first, ac, systems, in, 1886, thomas, edison, struck, out, personally, against, his, chief, rival, stating, just, as, certain, as, death, westinghouse, will, kill, a, customer, within, six, months, after, he, puts, in, a, system, of, any, size, he, has, got, a, new, thing, and, it, will, require, a, great, deal, of, experimenting, to, get, it, working, practically, many, reasons, have, been, suggested, for, edison, s, anti, ac, stance, one, notion, is, that, the, inventor, could, not, grasp, the, more, abstract, theories, behind, ac, and, was, trying, to, avoid, developing, a, system, he, did, not, understand, edison, also, appeared, to, have, been, worried, about, the, high, voltage, from, misinstalled, ac, systems, killing, customers, and, hurting, the, sales, of, electric, power, systems, in, general, the, primary, reason, was, that, edison, electric, based, their, design, on, low, voltage, dc, and, switching, a, standard, after, they, had, installed, over, 100, systems, was, in, edison, s, mind, out, of, the, question, by, the, end, of, 1887, edison, electric, was, losing, market, share, to, westinghouse, who, had, built, 68, ac, based, power, stations, to, edison, s, 121, dc, based, stations, to, make, matters, worse, for, edison, the, thomson, houston, electric, company, of, lynn, massachusetts, another, ac, based, competitor, built, 22, power, stations, parallel, to, expanding, competition, between, edison, and, the, ac, companies, was, rising, public, furor, over, a, series, of, deaths, in, the, spring, of, 1888, caused, by, pole, mounted, high, voltage, alternating, current, lines, this, turned, into, a, media, frenzy, against, high, voltage, alternating, current, and, the, seemingly, greedy, and, callous, lighting, companies, that, used, it, edison, took, advantage, of, the, public, perception, of, ac, as, dangerous, and, joined, with, self, styled, new, york, anti, ac, crusader, harold, p, brown, in, a, propaganda, campaign, aiding, brown, in, the, public, electrocution, of, animals, with, ac, and, supported, legislation, to, control, and, severely, limit, ac, installations, and, voltages, to, the, point, of, making, it, an, ineffective, power, delivery, system, in, what, was, now, being, referred, to, as, a, war, of, the, currents, the, development, of, the, electric, chair, was, used, in, an, attempt, to, portray, ac, as, having, a, greater, lethal, potential, than, dc, and, smear, westinghouse, via, edison, colluding, with, brown, and, westinghouse, s, chief, ac, rival, the, thomson, houston, electric, company, to, ensure, the, first, electric, chair, was, powered, by, a, westinghouse, ac, generator, edison, was, becoming, marginalized, in, his, own, company, having, lost, majority, control, in, the, 1889, merger, that, formed, edison, general, electric, in, 1890, he, told, president, henry, villard, he, thought, it, was, time, to, retire, from, the, lighting, business, and, moved, on, to, an, iron, ore, refining, project, that, preoccupied, his, time, edison, s, dogmatic, anti, ac, values, were, no, longer, controlling, the, company, by, 1889, edison, s, electric, s, own, subsidiaries, were, lobbying, to, add, ac, power, transmission, to, their, systems, and, in, october, 1890, edison, machine, works, began, developing, ac, based, equipment, cut, throat, competition, and, patent, battles, were, bleeding, off, cash, in, the, competing, companies, and, the, idea, of, a, merger, was, being, put, forward, in, financial, circles, the, war, of, currents, ended, in, 1892, when, the, financier, j, p, morgan, engineered, a, merger, of, edison, general, electric, with, its, main, alternating, current, based, rival, the, thomson, houston, company, that, put, the, board, of, thomson, houston, in, charge, of, the, new, company, called, general, electric, general, electric, now, controlled, three, quarters, of, the, us, electrical, business, and, would, compete, with, westinghouse, for, the, ac, market, edison, served, as, a, figurehead, on, the, company, s, board, of, directors, for, a, few, years, before, selling, his, shares, edison, moved, from, menlo, park, after, the, death, of, his, first, wife, mary, in, 1884, and, purchased, a, home, known, as, glenmont, in, 1886, as, a, wedding, gift, for, his, second, wife, mina, in, llewellyn, park, in, west, orange, new, jersey, in, 1885, thomas, edison, bought, 13, acres, of, property, in, fort, myers, florida, for, roughly, 2, 750, equivalent, to, 93, 256, in, 2023, and, built, what, was, later, called, seminole, lodge, as, a, winter, retreat, the, main, house, and, guest, house, are, representative, of, italianate, architecture, and, queen, anne, style, architecture, the, building, materials, were, pre, cut, in, new, england, by, the, kennebec, framing, company, and, the, stephen, nye, lumber, company, of, fairfield, maine, the, materials, were, then, shipped, down, by, boat, and, were, constructed, at, a, cost, of, 12, 000, each, which, included, the, cost, of, interior, furnishings, edison, and, mina, spent, many, winters, at, their, home, in, fort, myers, and, edison, tried, to, find, a, domestic, source, of, natural, rubber, due, to, the, security, concerns, around, world, war, i, edison, suggested, forming, a, science, and, industry, committee, to, provide, advice, and, research, to, the, us, military, and, he, headed, the, naval, consulting, board, in, 1915, edison, became, concerned, with, america, s, reliance, on, foreign, supply, of, rubber, and, was, determined, to, find, a, native, supply, of, rubber, edison, s, work, on, rubber, took, place, largely, at, his, research, laboratory, in, fort, myers, which, has, been, designated, as, a, national, historic, chemical, landmark, the, laboratory, was, built, after, thomas, edison, henry, ford, and, harvey, s, firestone, pulled, together, 75, 000, to, form, the, edison, botanical, research, corporation, initially, only, ford, and, firestone, were, to, contribute, funds, to, the, project, while, edison, did, all, the, research, edison, however, wished, to, contribute, 25, 000, as, well, edison, did, the, majority, of, the, research, and, planting, sending, results, and, sample, rubber, residues, to, his, west, orange, lab, edison, employed, a, two, part, acid, base, extraction, to, derive, latex, from, the, plant, material, after, it, was, dried, and, crushed, to, a, powder, after, testing, 17, 000, plant, samples, he, eventually, found, an, adequate, source, in, the, goldenrod, plant, edison, decided, on, solidago, leavenworthii, also, known, as, leavenworth, s, goldenrod, the, plant, which, normally, grows, roughly, 3, 4, feet, tall, with, a, 5, latex, yield, was, adapted, by, edison, through, cross, breeding, to, produce, plants, twice, the, size, and, with, a, latex, yield, of, 12, during, the, 1911, new, york, electrical, show, edison, told, representatives, of, the, copper, industry, it, was, a, shame, he, did, not, have, a, chunk, of, it, the, representatives, decided, to, give, a, cubic, foot, of, solid, copper, weighing, 486, pounds, with, their, gratitude, inscribed, on, it, in, appreciation, for, his, part, in, the, continuous, stimulation, in, the, copper, industry, edison, is, credited, with, designing, and, producing, the, first, commercially, available, fluoroscope, a, machine, that, uses, x, rays, to, take, radiographs, until, edison, discovered, that, calcium, tungstate, fluoroscopy, screens, produced, brighter, images, than, the, barium, platinocyanide, screens, originally, used, by, wilhelm, r, ntgen, the, technology, was, capable, of, producing, only, very, faint, images, the, fundamental, design, of, edison, s, fluoroscope, is, still, in, use, today, although, edison, abandoned, the, project, after, nearly, losing, his, own, eyesight, and, seriously, injuring, his, assistant, clarence, dally, dally, made, himself, an, enthusiastic, human, guinea, pig, for, the, fluoroscopy, project, and, was, exposed, to, a, poisonous, dose, of, radiation, he, later, died, at, the, age, of, 39, of, injuries, related, to, the, exposure, including, mediastinal, cancer, in, 1903, a, shaken, edison, said, don, t, talk, to, me, about, x, rays, i, am, afraid, of, them, nonetheless, his, work, was, important, in, the, development, of, a, technology, still, used, today, edison, invented, a, highly, sensitive, device, that, he, named, the, tasimeter, which, measured, infrared, radiation, his, impetus, for, its, creation, was, the, desire, to, measure, the, heat, from, the, solar, corona, during, the, total, solar, eclipse, of, july, 29, 1878, the, device, was, not, patented, since, edison, could, find, no, practical, mass, market, application, for, it, the, key, to, edison, s, initial, reputation, and, success, was, his, work, in, the, field, of, telegraphy, with, knowledge, gained, from, years, of, working, as, a, telegraph, operator, he, learned, the, basics, of, electricity, this, together, with, his, studies, in, chemistry, at, the, cooper, union, allowed, him, to, make, his, early, fortune, with, the, stock, ticker, the, first, electricity, based, broadcast, system, his, innovations, also, included, the, development, of, the, quadruplex, the, first, system, which, could, simultaneously, transmit, four, messages, through, a, single, wire, edison, was, granted, a, patent, for, a, motion, picture, camera, labeled, the, kinetograph, he, did, the, electromechanical, design, while, his, employee, william, kennedy, dickson, a, photographer, worked, on, the, photographic, and, optical, development, much, of, the, credit, for, the, invention, belongs, to, dickson, in, 1891, thomas, edison, built, a, kinetoscope, or, peep, hole, viewer, this, device, was, installed, in, penny, arcades, where, people, could, watch, short, simple, films, the, kinetograph, and, kinetoscope, were, both, first, publicly, exhibited, may, 20, 1891, in, april, 1896, thomas, armat, s, vitascope, manufactured, by, the, edison, factory, and, marketed, in, edison, s, name, was, used, to, project, motion, pictures, in, public, screenings, in, new, york, city, later, he, exhibited, motion, pictures, with, voice, soundtrack, on, cylinder, recordings, mechanically, synchronized, with, the, film, officially, the, kinetoscope, entered, europe, when, wealthy, american, businessman, irving, t, bush, 1869, 1948, bought, a, dozen, machines, from, the, continental, commerce, company, of, frank, z, maguire, and, joseph, d, baucus, bush, placed, from, october, 17, 1894, the, first, kinetoscopes, in, london, at, the, same, time, the, french, company, kin, toscope, edison, michel, et, alexis, werner, bought, these, machines, for, the, market, in, france, in, the, last, three, months, of, 1894, the, continental, commerce, company, sold, hundreds, of, kinetoscopes, in, europe, i, e, the, netherlands, and, italy, in, germany, and, in, austria, hungary, the, kinetoscope, was, introduced, by, the, deutsche, sterreichische, edison, kinetoscop, gesellschaft, founded, by, the, ludwig, stollwerck, of, the, schokoladen, s, sswarenfabrik, stollwerck, co, of, cologne, the, first, kinetoscopes, arrived, in, belgium, at, the, fairs, in, early, 1895, the, edison, s, kin, toscope, fran, ais, a, belgian, company, was, founded, in, brussels, on, january, 15, 1895, with, the, rights, to, sell, the, kinetoscopes, in, monaco, france, and, the, french, colonies, the, main, investors, in, this, company, were, belgian, industrialists, on, may, 14, 1895, the, edison, s, kin, toscope, belge, was, founded, in, brussels, businessman, ladislas, victor, lewitzki, living, in, london, but, active, in, belgium, and, france, took, the, initiative, in, starting, this, business, he, had, contacts, with, leon, gaumont, and, the, american, mutoscope, and, biograph, co, in, 1898, he, also, became, a, shareholder, of, the, biograph, and, mutoscope, company, for, france, edison, s, film, studio, made, nearly, 1, 200, films, the, majority, of, the, productions, were, short, films, showing, everything, from, acrobats, to, parades, to, fire, calls, including, titles, such, as, fred, ott, s, sneeze, 1894, the, kiss, 1896, the, great, train, robbery, 1903, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, 1910, and, the, first, frankenstein, film, in, 1910, in, 1903, when, the, owners, of, luna, park, coney, island, announced, they, would, execute, topsy, the, elephant, by, strangulation, poisoning, and, electrocution, with, the, electrocution, part, ultimately, killing, the, elephant, edison, manufacturing, sent, a, crew, to, film, it, releasing, it, that, same, year, with, the, title, electrocuting, an, elephant, as, the, film, business, expanded, competing, exhibitors, routinely, copied, and, exhibited, each, other, s, films, to, better, protect, the, copyrights, on, his, films, edison, deposited, prints, of, them, on, long, strips, of, photographic, paper, with, the, u, s, copyright, office, many, of, these, paper, prints, survived, longer, and, in, better, condition, than, the, actual, films, of, that, era, in, 1908, edison, started, the, motion, picture, patents, company, which, was, a, conglomerate, of, nine, major, film, studios, commonly, known, as, the, edison, trust, thomas, edison, was, the, first, honorary, fellow, of, the, acoustical, society, of, america, which, was, founded, in, 1929, edison, said, his, favorite, movie, was, the, birth, of, a, nation, he, thought, that, talkies, had, spoiled, everything, for, him, there, isn, t, any, good, acting, on, the, screen, they, concentrate, on, the, voice, now, and, have, forgotten, how, to, act, i, can, sense, it, more, than, you, because, i, am, deaf, his, favorite, stars, were, mary, pickford, and, clara, bow, starting, in, the, late, 1870s, edison, became, interested, and, involved, with, mining, high, grade, iron, ore, was, scarce, on, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, and, edison, tried, to, mine, low, grade, ore, edison, developed, a, process, using, rollers, and, crushers, that, could, pulverize, rocks, up, to, 10, tons, the, dust, was, then, sent, between, three, giant, magnets, that, would, pull, the, iron, ore, from, the, dust, despite, the, failure, of, his, mining, company, the, edison, ore, milling, company, edison, used, some, of, the, materials, and, equipment, to, produce, cement, in, 1901, edison, visited, an, industrial, exhibition, in, the, sudbury, area, in, ontario, canada, and, thought, nickel, and, cobalt, deposits, there, could, be, used, in, his, production, of, electrical, equipment, he, returned, as, a, mining, prospector, and, is, credited, with, the, original, discovery, of, the, falconbridge, ore, body, his, attempts, to, mine, the, ore, body, were, not, successful, and, he, abandoned, his, mining, claim, in, 1903, a, street, in, falconbridge, as, well, as, the, edison, building, which, served, as, the, head, office, of, falconbridge, mines, are, named, for, him, in, the, late, 1890s, edison, worked, on, developing, a, lighter, more, efficient, rechargeable, battery, at, that, time, called, an, accumulator, he, looked, on, them, as, something, customers, could, use, to, power, their, phonographs, but, saw, other, uses, for, an, improved, battery, including, electric, automobiles, the, then, available, lead, acid, rechargeable, batteries, were, not, very, efficient, and, that, market, was, already, tied, up, by, other, companies, so, edison, pursued, using, alkaline, instead, of, acid, he, had, his, lab, work, on, many, types, of, materials, going, through, some, 10, 000, combinations, eventually, settling, on, a, nickel, iron, combination, besides, his, experimenting, edison, also, probably, had, access, to, the, 1899, patents, for, a, nickel, iron, battery, by, the, swedish, inventor, waldemar, jungner, edison, obtained, a, us, and, european, patent, for, his, nickel, iron, battery, in, 1901, and, founded, the, edison, storage, battery, company, and, by, 1904, it, had, 450, people, working, there, the, first, rechargeable, batteries, they, produced, were, for, electric, cars, but, there, were, many, defects, with, customers, complaining, about, the, product, when, the, capital, of, the, company, was, exhausted, edison, paid, for, the, company, with, his, private, money, edison, did, not, demonstrate, a, mature, product, until, 1910, a, very, efficient, and, durable, nickel, iron, battery, with, lye, as, the, electrolyte, the, nickel, iron, battery, was, never, very, successful, by, the, time, it, was, ready, electric, cars, were, disappearing, and, lead, acid, batteries, had, become, the, standard, for, turning, over, gas, powered, car, starter, motors, at, the, start, of, world, war, i, the, american, chemical, industry, was, primitive, most, chemicals, were, imported, from, europe, the, outbreak, of, war, in, august, 1914, resulted, in, a, shortage, of, imported, chemicals, one, of, particular, importance, to, edison, was, phenol, which, was, used, to, make, phonograph, records, presumably, as, phenolic, resins, of, the, bakelite, type, at, the, time, phenol, came, from, coal, as, a, by, product, of, coke, oven, gases, or, manufactured, gas, for, gas, lighting, phenol, could, be, nitrated, to, picric, acid, and, converted, to, ammonium, picrate, a, shock, resistant, high, explosive, suitable, for, use, in, artillery, shells, most, phenol, had, been, imported, from, britain, but, with, war, parliament, blocked, exports, and, diverted, most, to, production, of, ammonium, picrate, britain, also, blockaded, supplies, from, germany, edison, responded, by, undertaking, production, of, phenol, at, his, silver, lake, facility, using, processes, developed, by, his, chemists, he, built, two, plants, with, a, capacity, of, six, tons, of, phenol, per, day, production, began, the, first, week, of, september, one, month, after, hostilities, began, in, europe, he, built, two, plants, to, produce, raw, material, benzene, at, johnstown, pennsylvania, and, bessemer, alabama, replacing, supplies, previously, from, germany, edison, manufactured, aniline, dyes, which, previously, had, been, supplied, by, the, german, dye, trust, other, wartime, products, include, xylene, p, phenylenediamine, shellac, and, pyrax, wartime, shortages, made, these, ventures, profitable, in, 1915, his, production, capacity, was, fully, committed, by, midyear, phenol, was, a, critical, material, because, two, derivatives, were, in, high, growth, phases, bakelite, the, original, thermoset, plastic, had, been, invented, in, 1909, aspirin, too, was, a, phenol, derivative, invented, in, 1899, it, had, become, a, blockbuster, drug, bayer, had, acquired, a, plant, to, manufacture, in, the, us, in, rensselaer, new, york, but, struggled, to, find, phenol, to, keep, their, plant, running, during, the, war, edison, was, able, to, oblige, bayer, relied, on, chemische, fabrik, von, heyden, in, piscataway, new, jersey, to, convert, phenol, to, salicylic, acid, which, they, converted, to, aspirin, it, is, said, that, german, companies, bought, up, supplies, of, phenol, to, block, production, of, ammonium, picrate, edison, preferred, not, to, sell, phenol, for, military, uses, he, sold, his, surplus, to, bayer, who, had, it, converted, to, salicylic, acid, by, heyden, some, of, which, was, exported, in, 1920, edison, spoke, to, american, magazine, saying, that, he, had, been, working, on, a, device, for, some, time, to, see, if, it, was, possible, to, communicate, with, the, dead, edison, said, the, device, would, work, on, scientific, principles, not, by, an, occult, means, the, press, had, a, field, day, over, edison, s, remarks, the, actual, nature, of, this, invention, remained, a, mystery, as, there, were, no, details, revealed, to, the, public, in, 2015, philippe, baudouin, a, french, journalist, found, a, copy, of, edison, s, diary, in, a, thrift, store, with, a, chapter, not, found, in, the, previously, published, editions, the, new, chapter, details, edison, s, theories, of, the, afterlife, and, the, scientific, basis, by, which, communication, with, the, dead, might, be, achieved, henry, ford, the, automobile, magnate, later, lived, a, few, hundred, feet, away, from, edison, at, his, winter, retreat, in, fort, myers, ford, once, worked, as, an, engineer, for, the, edison, illuminating, company, of, detroit, and, met, edison, at, a, convention, of, affiliated, edison, illuminating, companies, in, brooklyn, ny, in, 1896, edison, was, impressed, with, ford, s, internal, combustion, engine, automobile, and, encouraged, its, developments, they, were, friends, until, edison, s, death, edison, and, ford, undertook, annual, motor, camping, trips, from, 1914, to, 1924, harvey, firestone, and, naturalist, john, burroughs, also, participated, in, 1928, edison, joined, the, fort, myers, civitan, club, he, believed, strongly, in, the, organization, writing, that, the, civitan, club, is, doing, things, big, things, for, the, community, state, and, nation, and, i, certainly, consider, it, an, honor, to, be, numbered, in, its, ranks, he, was, an, active, member, in, the, club, until, his, death, sometimes, bringing, henry, ford, to, the, club, s, meetings, edison, was, active, in, business, right, up, to, the, end, just, months, before, his, death, the, lackawanna, railroad, inaugurated, suburban, electric, train, service, from, hoboken, to, montclair, dover, and, gladstone, new, jersey, electrical, transmission, for, this, service, was, by, means, of, an, overhead, catenary, system, using, direct, current, which, edison, had, championed, despite, his, frail, condition, edison, was, at, the, throttle, of, the, first, electric, mu, multiple, unit, train, to, depart, lackawanna, terminal, in, hoboken, in, september, 1930, driving, the, train, the, first, mile, through, hoboken, yard, on, its, way, to, south, orange, this, fleet, of, cars, would, serve, commuters, in, north, jersey, for, the, next, 54, years, until, their, retirement, in, 1984, a, plaque, commemorating, edison, s, inaugural, ride, can, be, seen, today, in, the, waiting, room, of, lackawanna, terminal, in, hoboken, which, is, presently, operated, by, nj, transit, edison, was, said, to, have, been, influenced, by, a, popular, fad, diet, in, his, last, few, years, the, only, liquid, he, consumed, was, a, pint, of, milk, every, three, hours, he, is, reported, to, have, believed, this, diet, would, restore, his, health, however, this, tale, is, doubtful, in, 1930, the, year, before, edison, died, mina, said, in, an, interview, about, him, correct, eating, is, one, of, his, greatest, hobbies, she, also, said, that, during, one, of, his, periodic, great, scientific, adventures, edison, would, be, up, at, 7, 00, have, breakfast, at, 8, 00, and, be, rarely, home, for, lunch, or, dinner, implying, that, he, continued, to, have, all, three, edison, became, the, owner, of, his, milan, ohio, birthplace, in, 1906, on, his, last, visit, in, 1923, he, was, reportedly, shocked, to, find, his, old, home, still, lit, by, lamps, and, candles, edison, died, of, complications, of, diabetes, on, october, 18, 1931, in, his, home, glenmont, in, llewellyn, park, in, west, orange, new, jersey, which, he, had, purchased, in, 1886, as, a, wedding, gift, for, mina, rev, stephen, j, herben, officiated, at, the, funeral, edison, is, buried, behind, the, home, edison, s, last, breath, is, reportedly, contained, in, a, test, tube, at, the, henry, ford, museum, near, detroit, ford, reportedly, convinced, charles, edison, to, seal, a, test, tube, of, air, in, the, inventor, s, room, shortly, after, his, death, as, a, memento, a, plaster, death, mask, and, casts, of, edison, s, hands, were, also, made, mina, died, in, 1947, on, december, 25, 1871, at, the, age, of, 24, edison, married, 16, year, old, mary, stilwell, 1855, 1884, whom, he, had, met, two, months, earlier, she, was, an, employee, at, one, of, his, shops, they, had, three, children, mary, edison, died, at, age, 29, on, august, 9, 1884, of, unknown, causes, possibly, from, a, brain, tumor, or, a, morphine, overdose, doctors, frequently, prescribed, morphine, to, women, in, those, years, to, treat, a, variety, of, causes, and, researchers, believe, that, her, symptoms, could, have, been, from, morphine, poisoning, edison, generally, preferred, spending, time, in, the, laboratory, to, being, with, his, family, on, february, 24, 1886, at, the, age, of, 39, edison, married, the, 20, year, old, mina, miller, 1865, 1947, in, akron, ohio, she, was, the, daughter, of, the, inventor, lewis, miller, co, founder, of, the, chautauqua, institution, and, a, benefactor, of, methodist, charities, they, also, had, three, children, together, mina, outlived, thomas, edison, dying, on, august, 24, 1947, wanting, to, be, an, inventor, but, not, having, much, of, an, aptitude, for, it, thomas, edison, s, son, thomas, alva, edison,

times, in, 1926, that, i, really, had, nothing, to, tell, him, but, i, hated, to, disappoint, him, so, i, thought, up, this, story, about, communicating, with, spirits, but, it, was, all, a, joke,
