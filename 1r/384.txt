completely, out, of, touch, with, european, culture, in, one, noted, speech, he, said, the, war, is, horrible, but, it, has, the, advantage, of, keeping, hitler, from, making, speeches, about, culture, mann, was, one, of, the, few, publicly, active, opponents, of, nazism, among, german, expatriates, in, the, u, s, in, a, bbc, broadcast, of, 30, december, 1945, mann, expressed, understanding, as, to, why, those, peoples, that, had, suffered, from, the, nazi, regime, would, embrace, the, idea, of, german, collective, guilt, but, he, also, thought, that, many, enemies, might, now, have, second, thoughts, about, revenge, and, he, expressed, regret, that, such, judgement, cannot, be, based, on, the, individual, those, whose, world, became, grey, a, long, time, ago, when, they, realized, what, mountains, of, hate, towered, over, germany, those, who, a, long, time, ago, imagined, during, sleepless, nights, how, terrible, would, be, the, revenge, on, germany, for, the, inhuman, deeds, of, the, nazis, cannot, help, but, view, with, wretchedness, all, that, is, being, done, to, germans, by, the, russians, poles, or, czechs, as, nothing, other, than, a, mechanical, and, inevitable, reaction, to, the, crimes, that, the, people, have, committed, as, a, nation, in, which, unfortunately, individual, justice, or, the, guilt, or, innocence, of, the, individual, can,

german, birth, i, finally, testify, that, i, am, painfully, familiar, with, certain, political, trends, spiritual, intolerance, political, inquisitions, and, declining, legal, security, and, all, this, in, the, name, of, an, alleged, state, of, emergency, that, is, how, it, started, in, germany, as, mann, joined, protests, against, the, jailing, of, the, hollywood, ten, and, the, firing, of, schoolteachers, suspected, of, being, communists, he, found, the, media, had, been, closed, to, him, finally, he, was, forced, to, quit, his, position, as, consultant, in, germanic, literature, at,

considered, an, anarchist, and, whom, he, lovingly, and, mockingly, admired, for, his, courage, to, be, boring, throughout, mann, s, dostoevsky, essay, he, finds, parallels, between, the, russian, and, the, sufferings, of, friedrich, nietzsche, speaking, of, nietzsche, he, says, his, personal, feelings, initiate, him, into, those, of, the, criminal, in, general, all, creative, originality, all, artist, nature, in, the, broadest, sense, of, the, word, does, the, same, it, was, the, french, painter, and, sculptor, degas, who, said, that, an, artist, must, approach, his, work, in, the, spirit, of, the, criminal, about, to, commit, a, crime, nietzsche, s, influence, on, mann, runs, deep, in, his, work, especially, in, nietzsche, s, views, on, decay, and, the, proposed, fundamental, connection, between, sickness, and, creativity, mann, believed, that, disease, should, not, be, regarded, as, wholly, negative, in, his, essay, on, dostoevsky, we, find, but, after, all, and, above, all, it, depends, on, who, is, diseased, who, mad, who, epileptic, or, paralytic, an, average, dull, witted, man, in, whose, illness, any, intellectual, or, cultural, aspect, is, non, existent, or, a, nietzsche, or, dostoyevsky, in, their, case, something, comes, out, in, illness, that, is, more, important, and, conducive, to, life, and, growth, than, any, medical, guaranteed, health, or, sanity, n, other, words, certain, conquests, made, by, the, soul, and, the, mind, are, impossible, without, disease, madness, crime, of, the, spirit, many, of, thomas, mann, s, works, have, the, following, similarities, defunct, during, world, war, i, mann, supported, the, conservatism, of, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, attacked, liberalism, and, supported, the, war, effort, calling, the, great, war, a, purification, a, liberation, an, enormous, hope, in, his, 600, page, long, work, reflections, of, a, nonpolitical, man, 1918, mann, presented, his, conservative, anti, modernist, philosophy, spiritual, tradition, over, material, progress, german, patriotism, over, egalitarian, internationalism, and, rooted, culture, over, rootless, civilisation, in, on, the, german, republic, von, deutscher, republik, 1922, mann, called, upon, german, intellectuals, to, support, the, new, weimar, republic, the, work, was, delivered, at, the, beethovensaal, in, berlin, on, 13, october, 1922, and, published, in, die, neue, rundschau, in, november, 1922, in, the, work, mann, developed, his, eccentric, defence, of, the, republic, based, on, extensive, close, readings, of, novalis, and, walt, whitman, also, in, 1921, he, wrote, an, essay, mind, and, money, in, which, he, made, a, very, open, assessment, of, his, family, background, in, any, case, i, am, personally, indebted, to, the, capitalist, world, order, from, the, past, which, is, why, it, will, never, be, appropriate, for, me, to, spit, on, it, as, it, is, la, mode, these, days, thereafter, his, political, views, gradually, shifted, toward, liberal, left, he, especially, embraced, democratic, principles, when, the, weimar, republic, was, established, mann, initially, gave, his, support, to, the, left, liberal, german, democratic, party, before, urging, unity, behind, the, social, democrats, probably, less, for, ideological, reasons, but, because, he, only, trusted, the, political, party, of, the, workers, to, provide, sufficient, mass, and, resistance, to, the, growing, nazism, in, 1930, he, gave, a, public, address, in, berlin, titled, an, appeal, to, reason, in, which, he, strongly, denounced, nazism, and, encouraged, resistance, by, the, working, class, this, was, followed, by, numerous, essays, and, lectures, in, which, he, attacked, the, nazis, at, the, same, time, he, expressed, increasing, sympathy, for, socialist, ideas, when, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, 1933, mann, and, his, wife, were, on, holiday, in, switzerland, due, to, his, strident, denunciations, of, nazi, policies, his, son, klaus, advised, him, not, to, return, in, contrast, to, those, of, his, brother, heinrich, and, his, son, klaus, mann, s, books, were, not, among, those, burnt, publicly, by, hitler, s, regime, in, may, 1933, possibly, since, he, had, been, the, nobel, laureate, in, literature, for, 1929, in, 1936, the, nazi, government, officially, revoked, his, german, citizenship, during, the, war, mann, made, a, series, of, anti, nazi, radio, speeches, published, as, listen, germany, in, 1943, they, were, recorded, on, tape, in, the, united, states, and, then, sent, to, the, united, kingdom, where, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, transmitted, them, hoping, to, reach, german, listeners, mann, expressed, his, belief, in, the, collection, of, letters, written, in, exile, listen, germany, deutsche, h, rer, that, equating, soviet, communism, with, nazi, fascism, on, the, basis, that, both, are, totalitarian, systems, was, either, superficial, or, insincere, in, showing, a, preference, for, nazism, he, clarified, this, view, during, a, german, press, interview, in, july, 1949, declaring, that, he, was, not, a, communist, but, that, communism, at, least, had, some, relation, to, ideals, of, humanity, and, of, a, better, future, he, said, that, the, transition, of, the, communist, revolution, into, an, autocratic, regime, was, a, tragedy, while, nazism, was, only, devilish, nihilism, mann, s, diaries, reveal, his, struggles, with, his, homosexuality, which, found, frequent, reflection, in, his, works, most, prominently, through, the, obsession, of, the, elderly,

at, its, depth, mann, s, infatuations, probably, remained, largely, platonic, katia, mann, tolerated, these, love, affairs, as, did, the, children, because, they, knew, that, it, didn, t, go, too,

earlier, or, later, date, but, the, experiences, themselves, were, not, yet, literary, only, in, retrospective, he, converted, them, into, literary, production, and, sublimated, his, shame, into, the, theory, that, a, writer, experiences, in, order, to, express, himself, that, his, life, is, just, material, mann, even, went, so, far, as, to, accuse, his, brother, heinrich, of, his, aestheticism, being, a, gesture, rich, highly, gifted, impotence, for, life, and, love, when, mann, met, the, aging, bachelor, heuser, who, had, worked, in, china, for, 18, years, for, the, last, time, in, 1954,

always, denied, his, novels, had, autobiographical, components, the, unsealing, of, his, diaries, revealing, how, consumed, his, life, had, been, with, unrequited, and, sublimated, passion, resulted,

the, pious, dance, adventure, book, of, a, youth, 1926, which, is, openly, set, in, berlin, s, homosexual, milieu, although, he, embraced, male, male, eroticism, he, disapproved, of, gay, lifestyle, the, eulenburg, affair, which, broke, out, two, years, after, mann, s, marriage, had, strengthened, him, in, his, renunciation, of, a, gay, life, and, he, supported, the, journalist, maximilian, harden, who, was, friends, with, katia, mann, s, family, in, his, denunciatory, trial, against, the, gay, prince, of, eulenburg, a, close, friend, of, emperor, wilhelm, ii, thomas, mann, was, always, concerned, about, his, dignity, reputation, and, respectability, the, poet, king, goethe, was, his, role, model, his, horror, at, a, possible, collapse, of, these, attributes, found, expression, in, the, character, of, aschenbach, in, death, in, venice, but, as, time, went, on, mann, became, more, open, when, the, twenty, two, year, old, war, novelist, gore, vidal, published, his, first, novel, the, city, and, the, pillar, in, 1948, a, love, story, between, small, town, american, boys, and, a, portrait, of, homosexual, life, in, new, york, and, hollywood, in, the, forties, a, highly, controversial, book, even, among, the, publishers, not, to, mention, the, press, mann, called, it, a, noble, work, when, the, physician, and, pioneer, of, gay, liberation, magnus, hirschfeld, sent, another, petition, to, the, reichstag, in, 1922, to, abolish, section, 175, of, the, german, criminal, code, under, which, many, homosexuals, were, imprisoned, simply, because, of, their, inclinations, thomas, mann, also, signed, however, criminal, liability, among, adults, was, only, abolished, through, a, change, in, the, law, on, june, 25, 1969, fourteen, years, after, mann, s, death, and, just, three, days, before, the, stonewall, riots, this, legal, situation, certainly, had, an, impact, throughout, his, life, the, man, whom, the, nazis, labeled, a, traitor, never, had,
