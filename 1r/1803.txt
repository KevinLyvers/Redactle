andrey, nikolaevich, kolmogorov, russian, ipa, 25, april, 1903, 20, october, 1987, was, a, soviet, mathematician, who, played, a, central, role, in, the, creation, of, modern, probability, theory, he, also, contributed, to, the, mathematics, of, topology, intuitionistic, logic, turbulence, classical, mechanics, algorithmic, information, theory, and, computational, complexity, andrey, kolmogorov, was, born, in, tambov, about, 500, kilometers, southeast, of, moscow, in, 1903, his, unmarried, mother, maria, yakovlevna, kolmogorova, died, giving, birth, to, him, andrey, was, raised, by, two, of, his, aunts, in, tunoshna, near, yaroslavl, at, the, estate, of, his, grandfather, a, well, to, do, nobleman, little, is, known, about, andrey, s, father, he, was, supposedly, named, nikolai, matveyevich, katayev, and, had, been, an, agronomist, katayev, had, been, exiled, from, saint, petersburg, to, the, yaroslavl, province, after, his, participation, in, the, revolutionary, movement, against, the, tsars, he, disappeared, in, 1919, and, was, presumed, to, have, been, killed, in, the, russian, civil, war, andrey, kolmogorov, was, educated, in, his, aunt, vera, s, village, school, and, his, earliest, literary, efforts, and, mathematical, papers, were, printed, in, the, school, journal, the, swallow, of, spring, andrey, at, the, age, of, five, was, the, editor, of, the, mathematical, section, of, this, journal, kolmogorov, s, first, mathematical, discovery, was, published, in, this, journal, at, the, age, of, five, he, noticed, the, regularity, in, the, sum, of, the, series, of, odd, numbers, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2, displaystyle, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2, etc, in, 1910, his, aunt, adopted, him, and, they, moved, to, moscow, where, he, graduated, from, high, school, in, 1920, later, that, same, year, kolmogorov, began, to, study, at, moscow, state, university, and, at, the, same, time, mendeleev, moscow, institute, of, chemistry, and, technology, kolmogorov, writes, about, this, time, i, arrived, at, moscow, university, with, a, fair, knowledge, of, mathematics, i, knew, in, particular, the, beginning, of, set, theory, i, studied, many, questions, in, articles, in, the, encyclopedia, of, brockhaus, and, efron, filling, out, for, myself, what, was, presented, too, concisely, in, these, articles, kolmogorov, gained, a, reputation, for, his, wide, ranging, erudition, while, an, undergraduate, student, in, college, he, attended, the, seminars, of, the, russian, historian, s, v, bakhrushin, and, he, published, his, first, research, paper, on, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, landholding, practices, in, the, novgorod, republic, during, the, same, period, 1921, 22, kolmogorov, worked, out, and, proved, several, results, in, set, theory, and, in, the, theory, of, fourier, series, in, 1922, kolmogorov, gained, international, recognition, for, constructing, a, fourier, series, that, diverges, almost, everywhere, around, this, time, he, decided, to, devote, his, life, to, mathematics, in, 1925, kolmogorov, graduated, from, moscow, state, university, and, began, to, study, under, the, supervision, of, nikolai, luzin, he, formed, a, lifelong, close, friendship, with, pavel, alexandrov, a, fellow, student, of, luzin, indeed, several, researchers, have, concluded, that, the, two, friends, were, involved, in, a, homosexual, relationship, although, neither, acknowledged, this, openly, during, their, lifetimes, kolmogorov, together, with, aleksandr, khinchin, became, interested, in, probability, theory, also, in, 1925, he, published, his, work, in, intuitionistic, logic, on, the, principle, of, the, excluded, middle, in, which, he, proved, that, under, a, certain, interpretation, all, statements, of, classical, formal, logic, can, be, formulated, as, those, of, intuitionistic, logic, in, 1929, kolmogorov, earned, his, doctor, of, philosophy, ph, d, degree, from, moscow, state, university, in, 1929, kolmogorov, and, alexandrov, during, a, long, travel, stayed, about, a, month, in, an, island, in, lake, sevan, in, armenia, in, 1930, kolmogorov, went, on, his, first, long, trip, abroad, traveling, to, g, ttingen, and, munich, and, then, to, paris, he, had, various, scientific, contacts, in, g, ttingen, first, with, richard, courant, and, his, students, working, on, limit, theorems, where, diffusion, processes, proved, to, be, the, limits, of, discrete, random, processes, then, with, hermann, weyl, in, intuitionistic, logic, and, lastly, with, edmund, landau, in, function, theory, his, pioneering, work, about, the, analytical, methods, of, probability, theory, was, published, in, german, in, 1931, also, in, 1931, he, became, a, professor, at, moscow, state, university, in, 1933, kolmogorov, published, his, book, foundations, of, the, theory, of, probability, laying, the, modern, axiomatic, foundations, of, probability, theory, and, establishing, his, reputation, as, the, world, s, leading, expert, in, this, field, in, 1935, kolmogorov, became, the, first, chairman, of, the, department, of, probability, theory, at, moscow, state, university, around, the, same, years, 1936, kolmogorov, contributed, to, the, field, of, ecology, and, generalized, the, lotka, volterra, model, of, predator, prey, systems, during, the, great, purge, in, 1936, kolmogorov, s, doctoral, advisor, nikolai, luzin, became, a, high, profile, target, of, stalin, s, regime, in, what, is, now, called, the, luzin, affair, kolmogorov, and, several, other, students, of, luzin, testified, against, luzin, accusing, him, of, plagiarism, nepotism, and, other, forms, of, misconduct, the, hearings, eventually, concluded, that, he, was, a, servant, to, fascistoid, science, and, thus, an, enemy, of, the, soviet, people, luzin, lost, his, academic, positions, but, curiously, he, was, neither, arrested, nor, expelled, from, the, academy, of, sciences, of, the, soviet, union, the, question, of, whether, kolmogorov, and, others, were, coerced, into, testifying, against, their, teacher, remains, a, topic, of, considerable, speculation, among, historians, all, parties, involved, refused, to, publicly, discuss, the, case, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, soviet, russian, mathematician, sem, n, samsonovich, kutateladze, concluded, in, 2013, after, reviewing, archival, documents, made, available, during, the, 1990s, and, other, surviving, testimonies, that, the, students, of, luzin, had, initiated, the, accusations, against, luzin, out, of, personal, acrimony, there, was, no, definitive, evidence, that, the, students, were, coerced, by, the, state, nor, was, there, any, definitive, evidence, to, support, their, allegations, of, academic, misconduct, soviet, historian, of, mathematics, a, p, yushkevich, surmised, that, unlike, many, of, the, other, high, profile, persecutions, of, the, era, stalin, did, not, personally, initiate, the, persecution, of, luzin, and, instead, eventually, concluded, that, he, was, not, a, threat, to, the, regime, which, would, explain, the, unusually, mild, punishment, relative, to, other, contemporaries, in, a, 1938, paper, kolmogorov, established, the, basic, theorems, for, smoothing, and, predicting, stationary, stochastic, processes, a, paper, that, had, major, military, applications, during, the, cold, war, in, 1939, he, was, elected, a, full, member, academician, of, the, ussr, academy, of, sciences, during, world, war, ii, kolmogorov, contributed, to, the, soviet, war, effort, by, applying, statistical, theory, to, artillery, fire, developing, a, scheme, of, stochastic, distribution, of, barrage, balloons, intended, to, help, protect, moscow, from, german, bombers, during, the, battle, of, moscow, in, his, study, of, stochastic, processes, especially, markov, processes, kolmogorov, and, the, british, mathematician, sydney, chapman, independently, developed, a, pivotal, set, of, equations, in, the, field, that, have, been, given, the, name, of, the, chapman, kolmogorov, equations, later, kolmogorov, focused, his, research, on, turbulence, beginning, his, publications, in, 1941, in, classical, mechanics, he, is, best, known, for, the, kolmogorov, arnold, moser, theorem, first, presented, in, 1954, at, the, international, congress, of, mathematicians, in, 1957, working, jointly, with, his, student, vladimir, arnold, he, solved, a, particular, interpretation, of, hilbert, s, thirteenth, problem, around, this, time, he, also, began, to, develop, and, has, since, been, considered, a, founder, of, algorithmic, complexity, theory, often, referred, to, as, kolmogorov, complexity, theory, kolmogorov, married, anna, dmitrievna, egorova, in, 1942, he, pursued, a, vigorous, teaching, routine, throughout, his, life, both, at, the, university, level, and, also, with, younger, children, as, he, was, actively, involved, in, developing, a, pedagogy, for, gifted, children, in, literature, music, and, mathematics, at, moscow, state, university, kolmogorov, occupied, different, positions, including, the, heads, of, several, departments, probability, statistics, and, random, processes, mathematical, logic, he, also, served, as, the, dean, of, the, moscow, state, university, department, of, mechanics, and, mathematics, in, 1971, kolmogorov, joined, an, oceanographic, expedition, aboard, the, research, vessel, dmitri, mendeleev, he, wrote, a, number, of, articles, for, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, in, his, later, years, he, devoted, much, of, his, effort, to, the, mathematical, and, philosophical, relationship, between, probability, theory, in, abstract, and, applied, areas, kolmogorov, died, in, moscow, in, 1987, and, his, remains, were, buried, in, the, novodevichy, cemetery, a, quotation, attributed, to, kolmogorov, is, every, mathematician, believes, that, he, is, ahead, of, the, others, the, reason, none, state, this, belief, in, public, is, because, they, are, intelligent, people, vladimir, arnold, once, said, kolmogorov, poincar, gauss, euler, newton, are, only, five, lives, separating, us, from, the, source, of, our, science, kolmogorov, received, numerous, awards, and, honours, both, during, and, after, his, lifetime, the, following, are, named, in, kolmogorov, s, honour, a, bibliography, of, his, works, appeared, in, publications, of, a, n, kolmogorov, annals, of, probability, 17, 3, 945, 964, july, 1989, doi, 10, 1214, aop, 1176991252, textbooks
