coup, comonfort, felt, that, by, temporarily, assuming, dictatorial, powers, he, could, hold, the, extremists, on, both, sides, in, check, and, pursue, a, middle, course, always, his, object, it, soon, became, obvious, that, such, an, assumption, was, merely, wishful, thinking, comonfort, accepted, and, had, ju, rez, imprisoned, in, the, capital, comonfort, however, had, blundered, in, overestimating, the, support, he, could, expect, among, the, state, governors, the, strategic, port, state, of, veracruz, disowned, the, plan, of, tacubaya, and, comonfort, realized, that, the, country, had, begun, to, fragment, into, civil, war, this, was, much, more, than, he, had, intended, and, he, began, to, back, away, from, the, conservatives, ju, rez, was, released, from, prison, on,

found, it, impossible, to, meet, its, domestic, and, its, foreign, obligations, a, british, minister, plenipotentiary, sir, charles, wyke, was, commissioned, on, march, 30, 1861, to, negotiate, british, claims, while, providing, reassurance, that, the, british, government, aimed, to, respect, mexican, sovereignty, and, maintain, cordial, relations, between, both, countries, on, may, 27,

would, culminate, in, the, second, french, intervention, in, mexico, and, the, failed, efforts, of, the, second, french, empire, to, overthrow, the, government, of, the, mexican, republic, and, impose, a, monarchy, upon, the, nation, the, main, french, pretext, for, subsequently, invading, mexico, had, been, specifically, the, issue, of, the, jecker, bonds, a, series, of, high, interest, loans, which, had, been, contracted, through, a, swiss, banker, named, jecker, by, the, conservative, government, during, the, reform, war, when, the, government, of, ju, rez, refused, to, honor, the,

mexican, monarchist, exiles, acting, independently, of, the, mexican, government, monarchism, in, mexico, had, been, reduced, to, irrelevance, after, the, fall, of, the, extremely, short, lived, first, mexican, empire, in, 1823, when, jos, mar, a, guti, rrez, de, estrada, had, attempted, to, revive, the, issue, by, proposing, a, monarchy, for, the, country, in, 1840, he, was, driven, out, of, the, country, by, public, outrage, which, included, condemnation, from, both, the, liberal, party, and, the, conservative, party, rejected, by, his, own, country, estrada, sought, support, for, his, monarchical, project, abroad, gaining, the, aid, of, the, mexican, diplomat, jos, manuel, hidalgo, y, esnaurr, zar, who, personally, knew, empress, eugenie, of, france, and, had, won, her, over, to, the, idea, of, a, mexican, monarchy, as, early, as, 1857, eugenie, was, enthusiastic, about, the, effort, to, establish, a, monarchy, in, mexico, but, napoleon, iii, was, skeptical, afraid, of, offending, the, united, states, through, the, violation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, this, concern, was, rendered, null, by, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1859, and, president, ju, rez, 1861, decree, suspending, foreign, debts, gave, france, a, pretext, to, send, troops, to, mexico, napoleon, iii, saw, an, advantage, in, establishing, a, client, state, on, the, american, continent, which, could, also, serve, as, a, buffer, state, to, united, states, expansionism, for, the, meantime, however, napoleon, iii, kept, his, full, aims, hidden, mexican, negotiations, with, wykes, had, broken, down, and, the, minister, wrote, back, to, london, advocating, that, the, british, navy, make, a, show, of, force, london, and, paris, began, to, make, arrangements, over, the, matter, and, soon, invited, the, government, of, spain, which, had, also, been, affected, by, the, president, ju, rez, suspension, of, debts, on, october, 31, 1861, the, convention, of, london, was, signed, between, france, great, britain, and, spain, formalizing, plans, to, militarily, intervene, in, mexico, for, the, purposes, of, arranging, its, debt, payments, foreign, minister, manuel, doblado, invited, the, commissioners, to, travel, to, orizaba, and, there, the, three, powers, proceeded, to, officially, recognized, the, government, of, ju, rez, along, with, mexican, sovereignty, on, 9, april, 1862, agreements, at, orizaba, between, the, allies, broke, down, as, france, made, it, increasingly, clear, that, it, intended, to, violate, mexican, sovereignty, in, violation, of, previous, agreements, the, british, informed, the, mexican, government, that, they, now, intended, to, exit, the, country, and, an, arrangement, was, made, with, the, british, government, to, settle, its, claims, spain, also, agreed, to, evacuate, the, country, minister, doblado, on, april, 11, 1862, made, it, known, to, the, french, government, that, its, intentions, were, leading, to, war,

mexico, by, the, time, the, french, intervention, began, and, the, conservative, party, was, initially, reluctant, to, join, the, french, in, establishing, a, monarchy, the, spanish, general, juan, prim, who, had, been, part, of, the, joint, expedition, would, report, to, his, government, that, there, had, been, no, monarchists, in, mexico, the, conservatives, would, eventually, be, won, over, as, they, opportunistically, sought, the, military, aid, to, return, themselves, to, power, after, their, loss, in, the, reform, war, napoleon, iii, sent, reinforcements, of, 30, 000, troops, under, the, command, of, general, forey, forey, reached, orizaba, on, 24, october, 1862, and, began, planning, another, siege, of, puebla, the, defense, of, which, had, now, passed, on, to, jes, s, gonz,

acceptance, of, maximilian, were, sent, by, the, french, to, miramar, and, maximilian, officially, accepted, the, throne, of, the, mexican, empire, on, april, 10, 1864, preparing, then, to, depart, for, the, country, maximilian, signed, arrangements, with, napoleon, agreeing, that, mexico, should, assume, the, cost, for, its, own, occupation, a, measure, which, caused, outrage, in, the, ju, rez,

immediately, recaptured, the, state, of, guerrero, the, approaching, end, of, the, american, civil, war, brought, much, hope, to, the, republican, cause, and, ju, rez, alluded, to, a, future, union, victory, in, order, to, inspire, his, partisans, for, a, victorious, united, states, would, be, able, to, more, stridently, oppose, the, second, french, intervention, as, a, violation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, after, the, civil, war, ended, in, april, 1865, a, concentration, of, american, troops, along, the, rio, bravo, caused, bazaine, to, send, more, of, his, troops, to, the, north, resulting, in, an, increase, of, republican, guerilla, activity, in, states, such, as, guanajuato, and, michoacan, some, imperial, prefects, resigned, for, lack, of, troops, and, emperor, maximilian,

to, evacuate, chihuahua, city, but, bazaine, did, not, pursue, any, further, fearing, a, clash, of, french, troops, with, american, troops, and, ju, rez, made, his, new, capital, in, el, paso, del,

rez, denied, the, validity, of, ortega, s, claims, arguing, that, the, relevant, constitutional, clause, concerned, itself, with, an, interim, presidency, for, the, purpose, of, arranging, new, elections, which, at, the, moment, were, impossible, ju, rez, passed, a, decree, prolonging, his, own, presidency, and, it, was, generally, accepted, among, the, liberals, throughout, late, 1865,
