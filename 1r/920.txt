john, the, apostle, ancient, greek, latin, ioannes, c, 6, ad, c, 100, ad, ge, ez, also, known, as, saint, john, the, beloved, and, in, eastern, orthodox, christianity, saint, john, the, theologian, was, one, of, the, twelve, apostles, of, jesus, according, to, the, new, testament, generally, listed, as, the, youngest, apostle, he, was, the, son, of, zebedee, and, salome, his, brother, james, was, another, of, the, twelve, apostles, the, church, fathers, identify, him, as, john, the, evangelist, john, of, patmos, john, the, elder, and, the, beloved, disciple, and, testify, that, he, outlived, the, remaining, apostles, and, was, the, only, one, to, die, of, natural, causes, although, modern, scholars, are, divided, on, the, veracity, of, these, claims, john, the, apostle, is, traditionally, held, to, be, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, and, many, christian, denominations, believe, that, he, authored, several, other, books, of, the, new, testament, the, three, johannine, epistles, and, the, book, of, revelation, together, with, the, gospel, of, john, are, called, the, johannine, works, depending, on, whether, he, is, distinguished, from, or, identified, with, john, the, evangelist, john, the, elder, and, john, of, patmos, although, the, authorship, of, the, johannine, works, has, traditionally, been, attributed, to, john, the, apostle, only, a, minority, of, contemporary, scholars, believe, he, wrote, the, gospel, and, most, conclude, that, he, wrote, none, of, them, regardless, of, whether, or, not, john, the, apostle, wrote, any, of, the, johannine, works, most, scholars, agree, that, all, three, epistles, were, written, by, the, same, author, and, that, the, epistles, did, not, have, the, same, author, as, the, book, of, revelation, although, there, is, widespread, disagreement, among, scholars, as, to, whether, the, author, of, the, epistles, was, different, from, that, of, the, gospel, john, the, apostle, was, the, son, of, zebedee, and, the, younger, brother, of, james, the, great, according, to, church, tradition, their, mother, was, salome, also, according, to, some, traditions, salome, was, the, sister, of, mary, jesus, mother, making, salome, jesus, aunt, and, her, sons, john, the, apostle, and, james, were, jesus, cousins, john, the, apostle, is, traditionally, believed, to, be, one, of, two, disciples, the, other, being, andrew, recounted, in, john, 1, 35, 39, who, upon, hearing, the, baptist, point, out, jesus, as, the, lamb, of, god, followed, jesus, and, spent, the, day, with, him, thus, becoming, the, first, two, disciples, called, by, jesus, on, this, basis, some, traditions, believe, that, john, was, first, a, disciple, of, john, the, baptist, even, though, he, is, not, named, in, this, episode, according, to, the, synoptic, gospels, matt, 4, 18, 22, mark, 1, 16, 20, luke, 5, 1, 11, zebedee, and, his, sons, fished, in, the, sea, of, galilee, jesus, then, called, peter, andrew, and, the, two, sons, of, zebedee, to, follow, him, james, and, john, are, listed, among, the, twelve, apostles, jesus, referred, to, the, pair, as, boanerges, translated, sons, of, thunder, a, gospel, story, relates, how, the, brothers, wanted, to, call, down, heavenly, fire, on, an, unhospitable, samaritan, town, but, jesus, rebuked, them, john, was, also, the, disciple, who, reported, to, jesus, that, they, had, forbidden, a, non, disciple, from, casting, out, demons, in, jesus, name, prompting, jesus, to, state, that, he, who, is, not, against, us, is, on, our, side, john, is, traditionally, believed, to, have, lived, on, for, more, than, fifty, years, after, the, martyrdom, of, his, brother, james, who, became, the, first, apostle, to, die, a, martyr, s, death, in, ad, 44, john, is, always, mentioned, in, the, group, of, the, first, four, apostles, in, the, gospels, and, in, the, book, of, acts, listed, either, second, third, or, fourth, john, along, with, his, brother, james, and, peter, formed, an, informal, triumvirate, among, the, twelve, apostles, in, the, gospels, jesus, allowed, them, to, be, the, only, apostles, present, at, three, particular, occasions, during, his, public, ministry, the, raising, of, jairus, daughter, transfiguration, of, jesus, and, agony, in, the, garden, of, gethsemane, jesus, sent, only, peter, and, john, into, the, city, to, make, the, preparation, for, the, final, passover, meal, the, last, supper, many, traditions, identify, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, in, the, gospel, of, john, as, the, apostle, john, but, this, identification, is, debated, at, the, meal, itself, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, sat, next, to, jesus, it, was, customary, to, recline, on, couches, at, meals, and, this, disciple, leaned, on, jesus, tradition, identifies, this, disciple, as, john, after, the, arrest, of, jesus, in, the, garden, of, gethsemane, only, peter, and, the, other, disciple, according, to, tradition, john, followed, him, into, the, palace, of, the, high, priest, the, beloved, disciple, alone, among, the, apostles, remained, near, jesus, at, the, foot, of, the, cross, on, calvary, alongside, myrrhbearers, and, numerous, other, women, following, the, instruction, of, jesus, from, the, cross, the, beloved, disciple, took, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, into, his, care, as, the, last, legacy, of, jesus, peter, and, john, were, also, the, only, two, apostles, who, ran, to, the, empty, tomb, after, mary, magdalene, bore, witness, to, the, resurrection, of, jesus, after, jesus, ascension, and, the, descent, of, the, holy, spirit, at, pentecost, john, together, with, peter, took, a, prominent, part, in, the, founding, and, guidance, of, the, church, he, was, with, peter, at, the, healing, of, the, lame, man, at, solomon, s, porch, in, the, temple, and, he, was, also, thrown, into, prison, with, peter, later, only, peter, and, john, went, to, visit, the, newly, converted, believers, in, samaria, while, he, remained, in, judea, and, the, surrounding, area, the, other, disciples, returned, to, jerusalem, for, the, apostolic, council, c, 48, 50, ad, paul, in, opposing, his, enemies, in, galatia, explicitly, recalled, that, john, along, with, peter, and, james, the, just, were, collectively, recognized, as, the, three, pillars, of, the, church, he, also, referred, to, the, recognition, that, his, apostolic, preaching, of, a, gospel, free, from, jewish, law, was, received, from, these, three, the, most, prominent, men, of, the, messianic, community, at, jerusalem, the, phrase, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, as, a, brother, ho, math, t, s, hon, gap, ho, i, sous, or, in, john, 20, 2, whom, jesus, loved, as, a, friend, hon, ephilei, ho, i, sous, is, used, six, times, in, the, gospel, of, john, but, in, no, other, new, testament, accounts, of, jesus, john, 21, 24, claims, that, the, gospel, of, john, is, based, on, the, written, testimony, of, this, disciple, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, is, specifically, referred, to, six, times, in, the, gospel, of, john, none, of, the, other, gospels, includes, anyone, in, the, parallel, scenes, that, could, be, directly, understood, as, the, beloved, disciple, for, example, in, luke, 24, 12, peter, alone, runs, to, the, tomb, mark, matthew, and, luke, do, not, mention, any, one, of, the, twelve, disciples, having, witnessed, the, crucifixion, there, are, also, two, references, to, an, unnamed, other, disciple, in, john, 1, 35, 40, and, john, 18, 15, 16, which, may, be, to, the, same, person, based, on, the, wording, in, john, 20, 2, church, tradition, has, held, that, john, is, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, and, four, other, books, of, the, new, testament, the, three, epistles, of, john, and, the, book, of, revelation, in, the, gospel, authorship, is, internally, credited, to, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, o, math, t, s, on, gapa, o, i, sous, in, john, 20, 2, john, 21, 24, claims, that, the, gospel, of, john, is, based, on, the, written, testimony, of, the, beloved, disciple, the, authorship, of, some, johannine, literature, has, been, debated, since, about, the, year, 200, in, his, 4th, century, ecclesiastical, history, eusebius, says, that, the, first, epistle, of, john, and, the, gospel, of, john, are, widely, agreed, upon, as, his, however, eusebius, mentions, that, the, consensus, is, that, the, second, and, third, epistles, of, john, are, not, his, but, were, written, by, some, other, john, eusebius, also, goes, to, some, length, to, establish, with, the, reader, that, there, is, no, general, consensus, regarding, the, revelation, of, john, the, revelation, of, john, could, only, be, what, is, now, called, the, book, of, revelation, the, gospel, according, to, john, differs, considerably, from, the, synoptic, gospels, which, were, likely, written, decades, earlier, the, bishops, of, asia, minor, supposedly, requested, him, to, write, his, gospel, to, deal, with, the, heresy, of, the, ebionites, who, asserted, that, christ, did, not, exist, before, mary, john, probably, knew, of, the, gospels, of, matthew, mark, and, luke, but, these, gospels, spoke, of, jesus, primarily, in, the, year, following, the, imprisonment, and, death, of, john, the, baptist, around, 600, however, sophronius, of, jerusalem, noted, that, two, epistles, bearing, his, name, are, considered, by, some, to, be, the, work, of, a, certain, john, the, elder, and, while, stating, that, revelation, was, written, by, john, of, patmos, it, was, later, translated, by, justin, martyr, and, irenaeus, presumably, in, an, attempt, to, reconcile, tradition, with, the, obvious, differences, in, greek, style, until, the, 19th, century, the, authorship, of, the, gospel, of, john, had, been, attributed, to, the, apostle, john, however, most, modern, critical, scholars, have, their, doubts, some, scholars, place, the, gospel, of, john, somewhere, between, ad, 65, and, 85, john, robinson, proposes, an, initial, edition, by, 50, 55, and, then, a, final, edition, by, 65, due, to, narrative, similarities, with, paul, pp, 284, 307, other, scholars, are, of, the, opinion, that, the, gospel, of, john, was, composed, in, two, or, three, stages, p, 43, most, contemporary, scholars, consider, that, the, gospel, was, not, written, until, the, latter, third, of, the, first, century, ad, and, with, the, earliest, possible, date, of, ad, 75, 80, a, date, of, ad, 75, 80, as, the, earliest, possible, date, of, composition, for, this, gospel, other, scholars, think, that, an, even, later, date, perhaps, even, the, last, decade, of, the, first, century, ad, right, up, to, the, start, of, the, 2nd, century, i, e, 90, 100, is, applicable, nonetheless, today, many, theological, scholars, continue, to, accept, the, traditional, authorship, colin, g, kruse, states, that, since, john, the, evangelist, has, been, named, consistently, in, the, writings, of, early, church, fathers, it, is, hard, to, pass, by, this, conclusion, despite, widespread, reluctance, to, accept, it, by, many, but, by, no, means, all, modern, scholars, modern, mainstream, bible, scholars, generally, assert, that, the, gospel, of, john, has, been, written, by, an, anonymous, author, regarding, whether, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, was, an, eyewitness, according, to, paul, n, anderson, the, gospel, contains, more, direct, claims, to, eyewitness, origins, than, any, of, the, other, gospel, traditions, f, f, bruce, argues, that, 19, 35, contains, an, emphatic, and, explicit, claim, to, eyewitness, authority, the, gospel, nowhere, claims, to, have, been, written, by, direct, witnesses, to, the, reported, events, mainstream, bible, scholars, assert, that, all, four, gospels, from, the, new, testament, are, fundamentally, anonymous, and, most, of, mainstream, scholars, agree, that, these, gospels, have, not, been, written, by, eyewitnesses, as, the, new, oxford, annotated, bible, 2018, has, put, it, scholars, generally, agree, that, the, gospels, were, written, forty, to, sixty, years, after, the, death, of, jesus, according, to, the, book, of, revelation, its, author, was, on, the, island, of, patmos, for, the, word, of, god, and, for, the, testimony, of, jesus, when, he, was, honoured, with, the, vision, contained, in, revelation, the, author, of, the, book, of, revelation, identifies, himself, as, john, in, standard, english, translation, the, early, 2nd, century, writer, justin, martyr, was, the, first, to, equate, the, author, of, revelation, with, john, the, apostle, however, most, biblical, scholars, now, contend, that, these, were, separate, individuals, since, the, text, was, written, around, 100, ad, after, the, death, of, john, the, apostle, although, many, historians, have, defended, the, identification, of, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, with, that, of, the, book, of, revelation, based, on, the, similarity, of, the, two, texts, john, the, presbyter, an, obscure, figure, in, the, early, church, has, also, been, identified, with, the, seer, of, the, book, of, revelation, by, such, authors, as, eusebius, in, his, church, history, book, iii, 39, and, jerome, john, is, considered, to, have, been, exiled, to, patmos, during, the, persecutions, under, emperor, domitian, revelation, 1, 9, says, that, the, author, wrote, the, book, on, patmos, i, john, both, your, brother, and, companion, in, tribulation, was, on, the, island, that, is, called, patmos, for, the, word, of, god, and, for, the, testimony, of, jesus, christ, adela, yarbro, collins, a, biblical, scholar, at, yale, divinity, school, writes, early, tradition, says, that, john, was, banished, to, patmos, by, the, roman, authorities, this, tradition, is, credible, because, banishment, was, a, common, punishment, used, during, the, imperial, period, for, a, number, of, offenses, among, such, offenses, were, the, practices, of, magic, and, astrology, prophecy, was, viewed, by, the, romans, as, belonging, to, the, same, category, whether, pagan, jewish, or, christian, prophecy, with, political, implications, like, that, expressed, by, john, in, the, book, of, revelation, would, have, been, perceived, as, a, threat, to, roman, political, power, and, order, three, of, the, islands, in, the, sporades, were, places, where, political, offenders, were, banished, pliny, natural, history, 4, 69, 70, tacitus, annals, 4, 30, some, modern, critical, scholars, have, raised, the, possibility, that, john, the, apostle, john, the, evangelist, and, john, of, patmos, were, three, separate, individuals, these, scholars, assert, that, john, of, patmos, wrote, revelation, but, neither, the, gospel, of, john, nor, the, epistles, of, john, the, author, of, revelation, identifies, himself, as, john, several, times, but, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, never, identifies, himself, directly, some, catholic, scholars, state, that, vocabulary, grammar, and, style, make, it, doubtful, that, the, book, could, have, been, put, into, its, present, form, by, the, same, person, s, responsible, for, the, fourth, gospel, there, is, no, information, in, the, bible, concerning, the, duration, of, john, s, activity, in, judea, according, to, tradition, john, and, the, other, apostles, remained, some, 12, years, in, this, first, field, of, labour, the, persecution, of, christians, under, herod, agrippa, i, r, 41, 44, ad, led, to, the, scattering, of, the, apostles, through, the, roman, empire, s, provinces, a, messianic, community, existed, at, ephesus, before, paul, s, first, labors, there, cf, the, brethren, in, addition, to, priscilla, and, aquila, the, original, community, was, under, the, leadership, of, apollos, 1, corinthians, 1, 12, they, were, disciples, of, john, the, baptist, and, were, converted, by, aquila, and, priscilla, according, to, tradition, after, the, assumption, of, mary, john, went, to, ephesus, irenaeus, writes, of, the, church, of, ephesus, founded, by, paul, with, john, continuing, with, them, until, the, times, of, trajan, from, ephesus, he, wrote, the, three, epistles, attributed, to, him, john, was, banished, by, the, roman, authorities, to, the, greek, island, of, patmos, where, according, to, tradition, he, wrote, the, book, of, revelation, according, to, tertullian, in, the, prescription, of, heretics, john, was, banished, presumably, to, patmos, after, being, plunged, into, boiling, oil, in, rome, and, suffering, nothing, from, it, it, is, said, that, all, in, the, audience, of, colosseum, were, converted, to, christianity, upon, witnessing, this, miracle, this, event, would, have, occurred, in, the, late, 1st, century, during, the, reign, of, the, emperor, domitian, who, was, known, for, his, persecution, of, christians, when, john, was, aged, he, trained, polycarp, who, later, became, bishop, of, smyrna, this, was, important, because, polycarp, was, able, to, carry, john, s, message, to, future, generations, polycarp, taught, irenaeus, passing, on, to, him, stories, about, john, similarly, ignatius, of, antioch, was, a, student, of, john, in, against, heresies, irenaeus, relates, how, polycarp, told, a, story, of, john, the, disciple, of, the, lord, going, to, bathe, at, ephesus, and, perceiving, cerinthus, within, rushed, out, of, the, bath, house, without, bathing, exclaiming, let, us, fly, lest, even, the, bath, house, fall, down, because, cerinthus, the, enemy, of, the, truth, is, within, it, is, traditionally, believed, that, john, was, the, youngest, of, the, apostles, and, survived, all, of, them, he, is, said, to, have, lived, to, old, age, dying, of, natural, causes, at, ephesus, sometime, after, ad, 98, during, the, reign, of, trajan, thus, becoming, the, only, apostle, who, did, not, die, as, a, martyr, an, alternative, account, of, john, s, death, ascribed, by, later, christian, writers, to, the, early, second, century, bishop, papias, of, hierapolis, claims, that, he, was, slain, by, the, jews, most, johannine, scholars, doubt, the, reliability, of, its, ascription, to, papias, but, a, minority, including, b, w, bacon, martin, hengel, and, henry, barclay, swete, maintain, that, these, references, to, papias, are, credible, zahn, argues, that, this, reference, is, actually, to, john, the, baptist, john, s, tomb, is, thought, to, be, located, in, the, former, basilica, of, st, john, at, sel, uk, a, small, town, in, the, vicinity, of, ephesus, the, opening, of, his, tomb, during, constantine, the, great, s, reign, yielded, no, bones, giving, rise, to, the, belief, that, his, body, was, assumed, into, heaven, another, fact, that, continues, to, advance, the, belief, of, st, john, s, assumption, into, heaven, is, the, fact, that, st, john, belongs, among, a, few, saints, who, left, no, bodily, relics, john, is, also, associated, with, the, pseudepigraphal, apocryphal, text, of, the, acts, of, john, which, is, traditionally, viewed, as, written, by, john, himself, or, his, disciple, leucius, charinus, it, was, widely, circulated, by, the, second, century, ce, but, deemed, heretical, at, the, second, council, of, nicaea, 787, ce, varying, fragments, survived, in, greek, and, latin, within, monastic, libraries, it, contains, strong, docetic, themes, but, is, not, considered, in, modern, scholarship, to, be, gnostic, the, feast, day, of, saint, john, in, the, roman, catholic, church, which, calls, him, saint, john, apostle, and, evangelist, and, in, the, anglican, communion, and, lutheran, calendars, which, call, him, saint, john, the, apostle, and, evangelist, is, on, 27, december, in, the, tridentine, calendar, he, was, commemorated, also, on, each, of, the, following, days, up, to, and, including, 3, january, the, octave, of, the, 27, december, feast, this, octave, was, abolished, by, pope, pius, xii, in, 1955, the, liturgical, color, is, white, john, apostle, and, evangelist, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, festival, on, 27, december, in, roman, catholic, tradition, he, is, considered, patron, of, turkey, asia, minor, and, turkish, people, until, 1960, another, feast, day, which, appeared, in, the, general, roman, calendar, is, that, of, saint, john, before, the, latin, gate, on, 6, may, celebrating, a, tradition, recounted, by, jerome, that, st, john, was, brought, to, rome, during, the, reign, of, the, emperor, domitian, and, was, thrown, in, a, vat, of, boiling, oil, from, which, he, was, miraculously, preserved, unharmed, a, church, san, giovanni, a, porta, latina, dedicated, to, him, was, built, near, the, latin, gate, of, rome, the, traditional, site, of, this, event, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, those, eastern, catholic, churches, which, follow, the, byzantine, rite, commemorate, the, repose, of, the, holy, apostle, and, evangelist, john, the, theologian, on, 26, september, on, 8, may, they, celebrate, the, feast, of, the, holy, apostle, and, evangelist, john, the, theologian, on, which, date, christians, used, to, draw, forth, from, his, grave, fine, ashes, which, were, believed, to, be, effective, for, healing, the, sick, john, is, also, commemorated, on, 30, june, as, a, member, of, the, twelve, apostles, there, is, also, a, commemoration, of, the, synaxis, of, the, apostle, john, at, diaconissa, on, 15, february, the, quran, also, speaks, of, jesus, s, disciples, but, does, not, mention, their, names, instead, referring, to, them, as, supporters, for, allah, the, sunnah, did, not, mention, their, names, either, however, some, muslim, scholars, mentioned, their, names, likely, relying, on, the, resources, of, christians, who, are, considered, people, of, the, book, in, islamic, tradition, muslim, exegesis, more, or, less, agrees, with, the, new, testament, list, and, says, that, the, disciples, included, peter, philip, thomas, bartholomew, matthew, andrew, james, jude, john, and, simon, the, zealot, notably, narrations, of, people, of, the, book, christians, and, jews, are, not, to, be, believed, or, disbelieved, by, muslims, as, long, as, there, is, nothing, that, supports, or, denies, them, in, quran, or, sunnah, druze, tradition, honors, several, mentors, and, prophets, and, john, the, apostle, is, honored, as, a, prophet, in, the, druze, tradition, and, doctrine, matthew, the, apostle, is, respected, for, his, contributions, to, spiritual, knowledge, and, guidance, druze, doctrine, teaches, that, christianity, is, to, be, esteemed, and, praised, as, the, gospel, writers, are, regarded, as, carriers, of, wisdom, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, teaches, that, john, is, mentioned, frequently, in, latter, day, revelation, 1, ne, 14, 18, 27, 3, ne, 28, 6, ether, 4, 16, d, c, 7, 27, 12, 61, 14, 77, 88, 141, for, latter, day, saints, these, passages, confirm, the, biblical, record, of, john, and, also, provide, insight, into, his, greatness, and, the, importance, of, the, work, the, lord, has, given, him, to, do, on, the, earth, in, new, testament, times, and, in, the, last, days, the, latter, day, scriptures, clarify, that, john, did, not, die, but, was, allowed, to, remain, on, the, earth, as, a, ministering, servant, until, the, time, of, the, lord, s, second, coming, john, 21, 20, 23, 3, ne, 28, 6, 7, d, c, 7, it, also, teaches, that, in, 1829, along, with, the, resurrected, peter, and, the, resurrected, james, john, visited, joseph, smith, and, oliver, cowdery, and, restored, the, priesthood, authority, with, apostolic, succession, to, earth, though, a, few, ex, latter, day, saints, claim, controversially, that, previous, editions, of, latter, day, scripture, contradict, this, claim, of, priesthood, authority, and, apostolic, succession, john, along, with, the, three, nephites, will, live, to, see, the, second, coming, of, christ, as, translated, beings, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, teaches, that, john, the, apostle, is, the, same, person, as, john, the, evangelist, john, of, patmos, and, the, beloved, disciple, as, he, was, traditionally, identified, with, the, beloved, apostle, the, evangelist, and, the, author, of, the, revelation, and, several, epistles, john, played, an, extremely, prominent, role, in, art, from, the, early, christian, period, onward, he, is, traditionally, depicted, in, one, of, two, distinct, ways, either, as,
