daniel, bernoulli, frs, b, r, n, u, l, i, bur, noo, lee, swiss, standard, german, 8, february, 1700, 27, march, 1782, was, a, swiss, mathematician, and, physicist, and, was, one, of, the, many, prominent, mathematicians, in, the, bernoulli, family, from, basel, he, is, particularly, remembered, for, his, applications, of, mathematics, to, mechanics, especially, fluid, mechanics, and, for, his, pioneering, work, in, probability, and, statistics, his, name, is, commemorated, in, the, bernoulli, s, principle, a, particular, example, of, the, conservation, of, energy, which, describes, the, mathematics, of, the, mechanism, underlying, the, operation, of, two, important, technologies, of, the, 20th, century, the, carburetor, and, the, aeroplane, wing, daniel, bernoulli, was, born, in, groningen, in, the, netherlands, into, a, family, of, distinguished, mathematicians, the, bernoulli, family, came, originally, from, antwerp, at, that, time, in, the, spanish, netherlands, but, emigrated, to, escape, the, spanish, persecution, of, the, protestants, after, a, brief, period, in, frankfurt, the, family, moved, to, basel, in, switzerland, daniel, was, the, son, of, johann, bernoulli, one, of, the, early, developers, of, calculus, and, a, nephew, of, jacob, bernoulli, an, early, researcher, in, probability, theory, and, the, discoverer, of, the, mathematical, constant, e, he, had, two, brothers, niklaus, and, johann, ii, daniel, bernoulli, was, described, by, w, w, rouse, ball, as, by, far, the, ablest, of, the, younger, bernoullis, he, is, said, to, have, had, a, bad, relationship, with, his, father, both, of, them, entered, and, tied, for, first, place, in, a, scientific, contest, at, the, university, of, paris, johann, banned, daniel, from, his, house, allegedly, being, unable, to, bear, the, shame, of, daniel, being, considered, his, equal, johann, allegedly, plagiarized, key, ideas, from, daniel, s, book, hydrodynamica, in, his, book, hydraulica, and, backdated, them, to, before, hydrodynamica, daniel, s, attempts, at, reconciliation, with, his, father, were, unsuccessful, when, he, was, in, school, johann, encouraged, daniel, to, study, business, citing, poor, financial, compensation, for, mathematicians, daniel, initially, refused, but, later, relented, and, studied, both, business, and, medicine, at, his, father, s, behest, under, the, condition, that, his, father, would, teach, him, mathematics, privately, daniel, studied, medicine, at, basel, heidelberg, and, strasbourg, and, earned, a, phd, in, anatomy, and, botany, in, 1721, he, was, a, contemporary, and, close, friend, of, leonhard, euler, he, went, to, st, petersburg, in, 1724, as, professor, of, mathematics, but, was, very, unhappy, there, a, temporary, illness, together, with, the, censorship, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, and, disagreements, over, his, salary, gave, him, an, excuse, for, leaving, st, petersburg, in, 1733, he, returned, to, the, university, of, basel, where, he, successively, held, the, chairs, of, medicine, metaphysics, and, natural, philosophy, until, his, death, in, may, 1750, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, his, earliest, mathematical, work, was, the, exercitationes, mathematical, exercises, published, in, 1724, with, the, help, of, goldbach, two, years, later, he, pointed, out, for, the, first, time, the, frequent, desirability, of, resolving, a, compound, motion, into, motions, of, translation, and, motion, of, rotation, his, chief, work, is, hydrodynamica, published, in, 1738, it, resembles, joseph, louis, lagrange, s, m, canique, analytique, in, being, arranged, so, that, all, the, results, are, consequences, of, a, single, principle, namely, conservation, of, energy, this, was, followed, by, a, memoir, on, the, theory, of, the, tides, to, which, conjointly, with, the, memoirs, by, euler, and, colin, maclaurin, a, prize, was, awarded, by, the, french, academy, these, three, memoirs, contain, all, that, was, done, on, this, subject, between, the, publication, of, isaac, newton, s, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, and, the, investigations, of, pierre, simon, laplace, bernoulli, also, wrote, a, large, number, of, papers, on, various, mechanical, questions, especially, on, problems, connected, with, vibrating, strings, and, the, solutions, given, by, brook, taylor, and, by, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, in, his, 1738, book, specimen, theoriae, novae, de, mensura, sortis, exposition, of, a, new, theory, on, the, measurement, of, risk, bernoulli, offered, a, solution, to, the, st, petersburg, paradox, as, the, basis, of, the, economic, theory, of, risk, aversion, risk, premium, and, utility, bernoulli, often, noticed, that, when, making, decisions, that, involved, some, uncertainty, people, did, not, always, try, to, maximize, their, possible, monetary, gain, but, rather, tried, to, maximize, utility, an, economic, term, encompassing, their, personal, satisfaction, and, benefit, bernoulli, realized, that, for, humans, there, is, a, direct, relationship, between, money, gained, and, utility, but, that, it, diminishes, as, the, money, gained, increases, for, example, to, a, person, whose, income, is, 10, 000, per, year, an, additional, 100, in, income, will, provide, more, utility, than, it, would, to, a, person, whose, income, is, 50, 000, per, year, one, of, the, earliest, attempts, to, analyze, a, statistical, problem, involving, censored, data, was, bernoulli, s, 1766, analysis, of, smallpox, morbidity, and, mortality, data, to, demonstrate, the, efficacy, of, inoculation, in, hydrodynamica, 1738, he, laid, the, basis, for, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, and, applied, the, idea, to, explain, boyle, s, law, he, worked, with, euler, on, elasticity, and, the, development, of, the, euler, bernoulli, beam, equation, bernoulli, s, principle, is, of, critical, use, in, aerodynamics, according, to, l, on, brillouin, the, principle, of, superposition, was, first, stated, by, daniel, bernoulli, in, 1753, the, general, motion, of, a, vibrating, system, is, given, by, a, superposition, of, its, proper, vibrations, in, 2002, bernoulli, was, inducted, into, the, international, air, space, hall, of, fame, at, the, san, diego, air, space, museum
