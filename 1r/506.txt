not, stunned, he, was, impressed, enough, to, insist, that, stravinsky, continue, lessons, but, advised, against, him, entering, the, saint, petersburg, conservatory, due, to, its, rigorous, environment, importantly, rimsky, korsakov, agreed, personally, to, advise, stravinsky, on, his, compositions, after, stravinsky, s, father, died, in, 1902, and, the, young, composer, became, more, independent, he, became, increasingly, involved, in, rimsky, korsakov, s, circle, of, artists, his, first, major, task, from, his, new, teacher, was, the, four, movement, piano, sonata, in, f, sharp, minor, in, the, style, of, glazunov, and, tchaikovsky, he, paused, temporarily, to, write, a, cantata, for, rimsky, korsakov, s, 60th, birthday, celebration, which, the, elder, composer, described, as, not, bad, soon, after, finishing, the, sonata, the, student, began, his, large, scale, symphony, in, e, flat, the, first, draft, of, which, he, finished, in, 1905, that, year, the, dedicatee, of, the, piano, sonata, nikolay, richter, performed, it, at, a, recital, hosted, by, the, rimsky, korsakovs, marking, the, first, public, premiere, of, a, stravinsky, piece, after, the, events, of,

spending, more, time, in, rimsky, korsakov, s, circle, of, artists, the, young, composer, became, increasingly, cramped, in, the, stylistically, conservative, atmosphere, modern, music, was, questioned, and, concerts, of, contemporary, music, were, looked, down, upon, the, group, occasionally, attended, chamber, concerts, oriented, to, modern, music, and, while, rimsky, korsakov, and, his, colleague, anatoly, lyadov, hated, attending, stravinsky, remembered, the, concerts, as, intriguing, and, intellectually, stimulating, being, the, first, place, he, was, exposed, to, french, composers, like, franck, dukas, faur, and, debussy, nevertheless, stravinsky, remained, loyal, to, rimsky, korsakov, the, musicologist, eric, walter, white, suspected, that, the, composer, believed, compliance, with, rimsky, korsakov, was, necessary, to, succeed, in, the, russian, music, world, stravinsky, later, wrote, that, his, teachers, musical, conservatism, was, justified, and, helped, him, build, the, foundation, that, would, become, the, base, of, his, style, in, august, 1905, stravinsky, announced, his, engagement, to, yekaterina, nosenko, his, first, cousin, whom, he, had, met, in, 1890, during, a, family, trip, he, later, recalled, from, our, first, hour, together, we, both, seemed, to, realize, that, we, would, one, day, marry, or, so, we, told, each, other, later, perhaps, we, were, always, more, like, brother, and, sister, i, was, a, deeply, lonely, child, and, i, wanted, a, sister, of, my, own, catherine, who, was, my, first, cousin, came, into, my, life, as, a, kind, of, long, wanted, sister, we, were, from, then, until, her, death, extremely, close, and, closer, than, lovers, sometimes, are, for, mere, lovers, may, be, strangers, though, they, live, and, love, together, all, their, lives, catherine, was, my, dearest, friend, and, playmate, until, we, grew, into, our, marriage, the, two, had, grown, close, during, family, trips, encouraging, each, other, s,

nosenko, s, best, friend, but, after, the, self, described, summer, romance, had, ended, nosenko, and, stravinsky, s, relationship, began, developing, into, a, furtive, romance, between, their, intermittent, family, visits, nosenko, studied, painting, at, the, acad, mie, colarossi, in, paris, the, two, married, on, 24, january, 1906, at, the, church, of, the, annunciation, five, miles,

1908, caused, stravinsky, deep, mourning, and, he, later, recalled, that, funeral, song, which, he, composed, in, memory, of, his, teacher, was, the, best, of, my, works, before, the, firebird, in, 1898, the, impresario, sergei, diaghilev, founded, the, russian, art, magazine, mir, iskusstva, but, after, it, ended, publication, in, 1904, he, turned, towards, paris, for, artistic, opportunities, rather, than, his, native, russia, in, 1907, diaghilev, presented, a, five, concert, series, of, russian, music, at, the, paris, opera, the, following, year, he, staged, the, paris, premiere, of,

russes, in, april, 1909, and, while, the, company, scored, successes, with, parisian, audiences, stravinsky, was, working, on, act, i, of, his, first, opera, the, nightingale, as, the, ballets, russes, faced, financial, issues, diaghilev, wanted, a, new, ballet, with, distinctly, russian, music, and, design, something, that, had, recently, become, popular, with, french, and, other, western, audiences, likely, due, to, the, group, of, russian, classical, composers, known, as, the, five, according, to, the, musicologist, richard, taruskin, diaghilev, s, company, settled, on, the, subject, of, the, mythical, firebird, diaghilev, asked, multiple, composers, to, write, the, ballet, s, score, including, lyadov, and, nikolai, tcherepnin, but, after, none, committed, to, the, project, the, impresario, turned, to, the, 27, year, old, stravinsky, who, gladly, accepted, the, task, during, the, ballet, s, production, stravinsky, became, close, with, diaghilev, s, artistic, circle, who, were, impressed, by, his, enthusiasm, to, learn, more, about, non, musical, art, forms, the, firebird, premiered, in, paris, as, l, oiseau, de, feu, on, 25, june, 1910, to, widespread, critical, acclaim, and, made, stravinsky, an, overnight, sensation, many, critics, praised, the, composer, s, alignment, with, russian, nationalist, music, stravinsky, later, recollected, that, after, the, premiere, and, subsequent, performances, he, met, many, figures, in, the, paris, art, scene, debussy, was, brought, on, stage, after, the, premiere, and, invited, stravinsky, to, dinner, beginning, a, lifelong, friendship, between, the, two, composers, the, stravinsky, family, moved, to, lausanne, switzerland, for, the, birth, of, their, third, child, soulima, and, it, was, there, that, stravinsky, began, work, on, a, konzertst, ck, for, piano, and, orchestra, depicting, the, tale, of, a, puppet, coming, to, life, after, diaghilev, heard, the, early, drafts, he, convinced, stravinsky, to, turn, it, into, a, ballet, for, the, 1911, season, the, resulting, work, petrushka, under, the, french, spelling, petrouchka, premiered, in, paris, on, 13, june, 1911, to, equal, popularity, as, the, firebird, and, stravinsky, became, established, as, one, of, the, most, advanced, young, theater, composers, of, his, time, while, composing, the, firebird, stravinsky, conceived, an, idea, for, a, work, about, what, he, called, a, solemn, pagan, rite, sage, elders, seated, in, a, circle, watched, a, young, girl, dance, herself, to, death, he, immediately, shared, the, idea, with, nicholas, roerich, a, friend, and, painter, of, pagan, subjects, when, stravinsky, told, diaghilev, about, the, idea, the, impresario, excitedly, agreed, to, commission, the, work, after, the, premiere, of, petrushka, stravinsky, settled, at, his, family, s, residence, in, ustilug, and, fleshed, out, the, details, of, the, ballet, with, roerich, later, finishing, the, work, in, clarens, switzerland, the, result, was, the, rite, of, spring, le, sacre, du, printemps, which, depicted, pagan, rituals, in, slavonic, tribes, and, used, many, avant, garde, techniques, including, uneven, rhythms, and, meters,

though, fellow, composers, were, impressed, by, the, music, s, emotion, and, free, treatment, of, counterpoint, and, themes, in, early, july, 1914, while, his, family, resided, in, switzerland, near, his, sick, wife, the, composer, traveled, to, russia, to, retrieve, texts, for, his, next, work, a, ballet, cantata, depicting, russian, wedding, traditions, titled, les, noces, soon, after, he,

composer, intensely, researched, russian, folk, poetry, and, prepared, librettos, for, numerous, works, to, be, composed, in, the, coming, years, including, les, noces, renard, pribaoutki, and, other, song, cycles, stravinsky, met, numerous, swiss, french, artists, during, his, time, in, morges, including, the, author, charles, f, ramuz, with, whom, he, collaborated, on, the, small, scale, theater, work, l, histoire, du, soldat, the, eleven, musician, and, two, dancer, show, was, designed, for, easy, travel, but, after, a, premiere, run, funded, by, werner, reinhart, all, other, performances, were, canceled, due, to, the, spanish, flu, epidemic, stravinsky, s, income, from, performance, royalties, was, suddenly, cut, off, when, his, germany, based, publisher, suspended, operations, due, to, the, war, to, keep, his, family, afloat, the, composer, sold, numerous, manuscripts, and, accepted, commissions, from, wealthy, impresarios, one, such, commission, included, renard, a, theater, work, completed, in, 1916, upon, a, request, from, princesse, edmond, de, polignac, additionally, stravinsky, made, a, new, concert, suite, from, the, firebird, and, sold, it, to, a, london,

the, war, ended, stravinsky, decided, that, his, residence, in, switzerland, was, too, far, from, europe, s, musical, activity, and, briefly, moved, his, family, to, carantec, france, in, september, 1920, they, relocated, to, the, home, of, coco, chanel, an, associate, of, diaghilev, s, where, stravinsky, composed, his, early, neoclassical, work, the, symphonies, of, wind, instruments, after, his, relationship, with, chanel, developed, into, an, affair, stravinsky, relocated, his, family, to, the, white, migr, hub, biarritz, in, may, 1921, partly, due, to, the, presence, of, his, other, lover, vera, de, bosset, at, the, time, de, bosset, was, married, to, the, former, ballet, russes, stage, designer, serge, sudeikin, though, de, bosset, later, divorced, sudeikin, to, marry, stravinsky, though, yekaterina, stravinsky, became, aware, of, her, husband, s, infidelity, the, stravinskys, never, divorced, likely, due, to, the, composer, s, refusal, to, separate, in, 1921, stravinsky, signed, a, contract, with, the, player, piano, company, pleyel, to, create, piano, roll, arrangements, of, his, music, he, received, a, studio, at, their, factory, on, the, rue, rochechouart, where, he, reorchestrated, les, noces, for, a, small, ensemble, including, player, piano, the, composer, transcribed, many, of, his, major, works, for, the, mechanical, pianos, and, the,

contract, in, 1924, this, time, with, the, aeolian, company, in, london, producing, rolls, that, included, comments, about, the, work, by, stravinsky, that, were, engraved, into, the, rolls, he, stopped, working, with, player, pianos, in, 1930, when, the, aeolian, company, s, london, branch, was, dissolved, the, interest, in, pushkin, shared, by, stravinsky, and, diaghilev, led, to, mavra, a, comic, opera, begun, in, 1921, that, exhibited, the, composer, s, rejection, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, style, and, his, turn, towards, classic, russian, operatists, like, tchaikovsky, glinka, and, dargomyzhsky, yet, after, the, 1922, premiere, the, work, s, tame, nature, compared, to, the, innovative, music, stravinsky, had, come, to, be, known, for, disappointed, critics, in, 1923, stravinsky, finished, orchestrating, les, noces, settling, on, a, percussion, ensemble, including, four, pianos, the, ballets, russes, staged, the, ballet, cantata, that, june, and, although, it, initially, received, moderate, reviews, the, london, production, received, a, flurry, of, critical, attacks, leading, the, writer, h, g, wells, to, publish, an, open, letter, in, support, of, the, work, during, this, period, stravinsky, expanded, his, involvement, in, conducting, and, piano, performance, he, conducted, the, premiere, of, his, octet, in, 1923, and, served, as, the, soloist, for, the, premiere, of, his, piano, concerto, in, 1924, following, its, debut, he, embarked, on, a, tour, performing, the, concerto, in, over, 40, concerts, the, stravinsky, family, moved, again, in, september, 1924, to, nice, france, the, composer, s, schedule, was, divided, between, spending, time, with, his, family, in, nice, performing, in, paris, and, touring, other, locations, often, accompanied, by, de, bosset, at, this, time, stravinsky, was, going, through, a, spiritual, crisis, onset, by, meeting, father, nicolas, a, priest, near, his, new, home, he, had, abandoned, the, russian, orthodox, church, during, his, teenage, years, but, after, meeting, father, nicolas, in, 1926, and, reconnecting, with, his, faith, he, began, regularly, attending, services, from, then, until, moving, to, the, united, states, stravinsky, diligently, attended, church, participated, in, charity, work, and, studied, religious, texts, the, composer, later, wrote, that, he, was, contacted, by, god, at, a, service, at, the, basilica, of, saint, anthony, of, padua, leading, him, to, write, his, first, religious, composition, the, pater, noster, for, a, cappella, choir, in, 1925, stravinsky, asked, the, french, writer, and, artist, jean, cocteau, to, write, the, libretto, for, an, operatic, setting, of, sophocles, tragedy, oedipus, rex, in, latin, the, may, 1927, premiere, of, his, opera, oratorio, oedipus, rex, was, staged, as, a, concert, performance, since, there, was, too, little, time, and, money, to, present, it, as, a, full, opera, and, stravinsky, attributed, the, work, s, critical, failure, to, its, programming, between, two, glittery, ballets, furthermore, the, influence, from, russian, orthodox, vocal, music, and, 18th, century, composers, like, handel, was, not, well, received, in, the, press, after, the, may, 1927, premiere, neoclassicism, was, not, popular, with, parisian, critics, and, stravinsky, had, to, publicly, assert, that, his, music, was, not, part, of, the, movement, this, reception, from, critics, was, not, improved, by, stravinsky, s, next, ballet, apollon, musag, te, which, depicted, the, birth, and, apotheosis, of, apollo, using, an, 18th, century, ballet, de, cour, musical, style, george, balanchine, choreographed, the, premiere, beginning, decades, of, collaborations, between, stravinsky, and, the, choreographer, nevertheless, some, critics, found, it, to, be, a, turning, point, in, stravinsky, s, neoclassical, music, describing, it, as, a, pure, work, that, blended, neoclassical, ideas, with, modern, methods, of, composition, a, new, commission, for, a, ballet, from, ida, rubinstein, in, 1928, led, stravinsky, again, to, tchaikovsky, basing, the, music, on, romantic, ballets, like, swan, lake, and, borrowing, many, themes, from, tchaikovsky, stravinsky, wrote, the, fairy, s, kiss, with, hans, christian, andersen, s, tale, the, ice, maiden, as, the, subject, the, november, 1928, premiere, was, not, well, received, likely, due, to, the, disconnect, between, each, of, the, ballet, s, sections, and, the, mediocre, choreography, of, which, stravinsky, disapproved, diaghilev, s, fury, with, stravinsky, for, accepting, a, ballet, commission, from, someone, else, caused, an, intense, feud, between, the, two, one, that, lasted, until, the, impresario, s, death, in, august, 1929, most, of, that, year, was, spent, composing, a, new, solo, piano, work, the, capriccio, and, touring, across, europe, to, conduct, and, perform, piano, the, capriccio, s, success, after, the, december, 1929, premiere, caused, a, flurry, of, performance, requests, from, many, orchestras, a, commission, from, the, boston, symphony, orchestra, in, 1930, for, a, symphonic, work, led, stravinsky, back, to, latin, texts, this, time, from, the, book, of, psalms, between, touring, concerts, he, composed, the, choral, symphony, of, psalms, a, deeply, religious, work, that, premiered, in, december, of, that, year, while, touring, in, germany, stravinsky, visited, his, publisher, s, home, and, met, the, violinist, samuel, dushkin, who, convinced, him, to, compose, the, violin, concerto, with, dushkin, s, help, on, the, solo, part, impressed, by, dushkin, s, virtuosic, ability, and, understanding, of, music, the, composer, wrote, more, music, for, violin, and, piano, and, rearranged, some, of, his, earlier, music, to, be, performed, alongside, the, concerto, while, on, tour, until, 1933, that, year, stravinsky, received, another, ballet, commission, from, ida, rubenstein, for, a, setting, of, a, poem, by, andr, gide, the, resulting, melodrama, pers, phone, only, received, three, performances, in, 1934, due, to, its, lukewarm, reception, and, stravinsky, s, disdain, towards, the, work, was, evident, in, his, later, suggestion, that, the, libretto, be, rewritten, in, june, of, that, year, stravinsky, became, a, naturalized, french, citizen, protecting, all, his, future, works, under, copyright, in, france, and, the, united, states, his, family, subsequently, moved, to, an, apartment, on, the, rue, du, faubourg, saint, honor, in, paris, where, he, began, writing, a, two, volume, autobiography, with, the, help, of, walter, nouvel, published, in, 1935, and, 1936, as, chroniques, de, ma, vie, after, the, short, run, of, pers, phone, stravinsky, embarked, on, a, successful, three, month, tour, of, the, united, states, with, dushkin, he, visited, south, america, for, the, first, time, the, following, year, the, composer, s, son, soulima, was, an, excellent, pianist, having, performed, the, capriccio, in, concert, with, his, father, conducting, continuing, a, line, of, solo, piano, works, the, elder, stravinsky, composed, the, concerto, for, two, pianos, to, be, performed, by, them, both, and, they, toured, the, work, through, 1936, around, this, time, came, three, american, commissioned, works, the, ballet, jeu, de, cartes, for, balanchine, the, brandenburg, concerto, like, work, dumbarton, oaks, and, the, lamenting, symphony, in, c, for, the, chicago, symphony, orchestra, s, 50th, anniversary, stravinsky, s, last, years, in, france, from, late, 1938, to, 1939, were, marked, by, the, deaths, of, his, eldest, daughter, his, wife, and, his, mother, the, former, two, from, tuberculosis, in, addition, the, increasingly, hostile, criticism, of, his, music, in, major, publications, and, failed, run, for, a, seat, at, the, institut, de, france, further, dissociated, him, from, france, and, shortly, after, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, in, september, 1939, he, moved, to, the, united, states, upon, arriving, in, the, united, states, stravinsky, resided, with, edward, w, forbes, the, director, of, the, charles, eliot, norton, lectures, series, at, harvard, university, the, composer, was, contracted, to, deliver, six, lectures, for, the, series, beginning, in, october, 1939, and, ending, in, april, 1940, the, lectures, written, with, assistance, from, pyotr, suvchinsky, and, alexis, roland, manuel, were, published, in, french, under, the, title, po, tique, musicale, poetics, of, music, in, 1941, with, an, english, translation, following, in, 1947, between, lectures, stravinsky, finished, the, symphony, in, c, and, toured, across, the, country, meeting, de, bosset, upon, her, arrival, in, new, york, stravinsky, and, de, bosset, finally, married, on, 9, march, 1940, in, bedford, massachusetts, after, the, completion, of, his, lecture, series, the, couple, moved, to, los, angeles, where, they, applied, for, american, naturalization, money, became, scarce, as, the, war, stopped, the, composer, from, receiving, european, royalties, making, him, take, up, numerous, conducting, engagements, and, compose, commercial, works, for, the, entertainment, industry, including, the, scherzo, la, russe, for, paul, whiteman, and, the, sc, nes, de, ballet, for, a, broadway, revue, some, discarded, film, music, made, it, into, larger, works, as, with, the, war, inspired, symphony, in, three, movements, the, middle, movement, of, which, used, music, from, an, unused, score, for, the, song, of, bernadette, 1943, the, couple, s, poor, english, led, to, the, formation, of, a, predominantly, european, social, circle, and, home, life, the, estate, staff, consisted, of, mostly, russians, and, frequent, guests, included, musicians, joseph, szigeti, arthur, rubinstein, and, sergei, rachmaninoff, however, stravinsky, eventually, joined, popular, hollywood, circles, attending, parties, with, celebrities, and, becoming, closely, acquainted, with, european, authors, aldous, huxley, w, h, auden, christopher, isherwood, and, dylan, thomas, in, 1945, stravinsky, received, american, citizenship, and, subsequently, signed, a, contract, with, british, publishing, house, boosey, hawkes, who, agreed, to, publish, all, his, future, works, additionally, he, revised, many, of, his, older, works, and, had, boosey, hawkes, publish, the, new, editions, to, re, copyright, his, older, works, around, the, 1948, premiere, of, another, balanchine, collaboration, the, ballet, orpheus, the, composer, met, the, young, conductor, robert, craft, in, new, york, craft, had, asked, stravinsky, to, explain, the, revision, of, the, symphonies, of, wind, instruments, for, an, upcoming, concert, the, two, quickly, became, friends, and, stravinsky, invited, craft, to, los, angeles, the, young, conductor, soon, became, stravinsky, s, assistant, collaborator, and, amanuensis, until, the, composer, s, death, as, stravinsky, became, more, familiar, with, english, he, developed, the, idea, to, write, an, english, language, opera, based, on, a, series, of, paintings, by, 18th, century, artist, william, hogarth, titled, the, rake, s, progress, the, composer, joined, auden, to, write, the, libretto, in, november, 1947, american, writer, chester, kallman, was, later, brought, in, to, assist, auden, stravinsky, finished, the, opera, of, the, same, name, in, 1951, and, despite, its, widespread, performances, and, success, the, composer, was, dismayed, to, find, that, his, newer, music, did, not, captivate, young, composers, craft, had, introduced, stravinsky, to, the, serial, music, of, the, second, viennese, school, shortly, after, the, rake, s, progress, premiered, and, the, opera, s, composer, began, studying, and, listening, to, the, music, of, anton, webern, and, arnold, schoenberg, during, the, 1950s, stravinsky, continued, touring, extensively, across, the, world, occasionally, returning, to, los, angeles, to, compose, in, 1953, he, agreed, to, compose, a, new, opera, with, a, libretto, by, dylan, thomas, but, development, on, the, project, came, to, a, sudden, end, following, thomas, s, death, in, november, of, that, year, stravinsky, completed, in, memoriam, dylan, thomas, his, first, work, fully, based, on, the, serial, twelve, tone, technique, the, following, year, the, 1956, cantata, canticum, sacrum, premiered, at, the, international, festival, of, contemporary, music, in, venice, inspiring, norddeutscher, rundfunk, to, commission, the, musical, setting, threni, in, 1957, with, the, balanchine, ballet, agon, stravinsky, fused, neoclassical, themes, with, the, twelve, tone, technique, and, threni, showed, his, full, shift, towards, use, of, tone, rows, in, 1959, craft, interviewed, stravinsky, for, an, article, titled, answers, to, 35, questions, in, which, the, composer, sought, to, correct, myths, surrounding, him, and, discuss, his, relationships, with, other, artists, the, article, was, later, expanded, into, a, book, and, over, the, next, four, years, three, more, interview, style, books, were, published, continued, international, tours, brought, stravinsky, to, washington, d, c, in, january, 1962, where, he, attended, a, dinner, at, the, white, house, with, then, president, john, f, kennedy, in, honor, of, the, composer, s, 80th, birthday, although, it, was, largely, an, anti, soviet, political, stunt, stravinsky, remembered, the, event, fondly, composing, the, elegy, for, j, f, k, after, the, president, s, assassination, a, year, later, in, september, 1962, he, returned, to, russia, for, the, first, time, since, 1914, accepting, an, invitation, from, the, union, of, soviet, composers, to, conduct, six, performances, in, moscow, and, leningrad, after, the, success, of, the, firebird, and, the, rite, of, spring, in, the, 1910s, stravinsky, s, music, was, respected, and, frequently, performed, in, the, soviet, union, influencing, young, soviet, composers, at, the, time, like, dmitri, shostakovich, however, after, stalin, began, consolidating, power, in, the, early, 1930s, stravinsky, s, music, nearly, vanished, and, was, formally, banned, in, 1948, a, new, interest, in, his, works, was, born, during, the, khrushchev, thaw, partly, due, to, the, composer, s, 1962, visit, during, his, three, week, visit, he, met, with, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, and, several, leading, soviet, composers, including, shostakovich, and, aram, khachaturian, stravinsky, did, not, return, to, los, angeles, until, december, 1962, after, eight, months, of, almost, continual, traveling, stravinsky, revisited, biblical, themes, for, many, of, his, later, works, notably, in, the, 1961, chamber, cantata, a, sermon, a, narrative, and, a, prayer, the, 1962, musical, television, production, the, flood, the, 1963, hebrew, cantata, abraham, and, isaac, and, the, 1966, requiem, canticles, the, last, of, which, was, his, final, major, composition, between, tours, the, composer, worked, relentlessly, to, devise, new, tone, rows, even, working, on, toilet, paper, from, airplane, lavatories, the, intense, touring, schedule, began, taking, a, toll, on, the, elderly, composer, january, 1967, marked, his, last, recording, session, and, his, final, public, concert, came, the, following, may, after, spending, the, autumn, of, 1967, in, the, hospital, due, to, bleeding, stomach, ulcers, and, thrombosis, stravinsky, returned, to, domestic, touring, in, 1968, only, appearing, as, an, audience, member, but, stopped, composing, due, to, his, gradual, decline, in, physical, health, in, his, final, years, the, stravinskys, and, craft, moved, to, new, york, to, be, closer, to, medical, care, and, the, composer, s, travel, was, limited, to, visiting, family, in, europe, soon, after, being, discharged, from, lenox, hill, hospital, after, contracting, pulmonary, edema, the, stravinskys, moved, to, a, new, apartment, on, fifth, avenue, where, the, composer, died, on, 6, april, 1971, at, the, age, of, 88, a, funeral, service, was, held, three, days, later, at, the, frank, e, campbell, funeral, chapel, after, a, service, at, santi, giovanni, e, paolo, with, a, performance, of, the, requiem, canticles, conducted, by, craft, stravinsky, was, buried, on, the, cemetery, island, of, san, michele, in, venice, several, yards, from, the, tomb, of, sergei, diaghilev, much, of, stravinsky, s, music, is, characterized, by, short, sharp, articulations, with, minimal, rubato, or, vibrato, his, student, works, were, primarily, assignments, from, his, teacher, rimsky, korsakov, and, were, mainly, influenced, by, russian, composers, his, first, three, ballets, the, firebird, petrushka, and, the, rite, of, spring, marked, the, beginning, of, his, international, fame, and, a, departure, from, 19th, century, styles, stravinsky, s, music, is, often, divided, into, three, periods, of, composition, his, russian, period, 1913, 1920, where, he, was, greatly, influenced, by, russian, artists, and, folklore, his, neoclassical, period, 1920, 1951, where, he, turned, towards, techniques, and, themes, from, the, classical, period, and, his, serial, period, 1954, 1968, where, he, used, highly, structured, composition, techniques, pioneered, by, composers, of, the, second, viennese, school, stravinsky, s, time, before, meeting, diaghilev, was, spent, learning, from, rimsky, korsakov, and, his, collaborators, only, three, works, survive, from, before, stravinsky, met, rimsky, korsakov, in, august, 1902, tarantella, 1898, scherzo, in, g, minor, 1902, and, the, storm, cloud, the, first, two, being, works, for, piano, and, the, last, for, voice, and, piano, stravinsky, s, first, assignment, from, rimsky, korsakov, was, the, four, movement, piano, sonata, in, f, sharp, minor, which, was, also, his, first, work, to, be, performed, in, public, rimsky, korsakov, often, gave, stravinsky, the, task, of, orchestrating, various, works, to, allow, him, to, analyze, the, works, form, and, structure, many, of, stravinsky, s, early, works, showed, influence, from, french, composers, as, well, notably, in, the, minimal, use, of, large, doublings, and, different, combinations, of, tone, colors, a, number, of, stravinsky, s, student, compositions, were, performed, at, rimsky, korsakov, s, gatherings, at, his, home, these, include, a, set, of, bagatelles, a, chanson, comique, and, a, cantata, showing, the, use, of, classical, musical, techniques, that, would, later, define, stravinsky, s, neoclassical, period, the, musicologist, stephen, walsh, described, this, time, in, stravinsky, s, musical, career, as, aesthetically, cramped, due, to, the, cynical, conservatism, of, rimsky, korsakov, and, his, music, rimsky, korsakov, thought, the, symphony, in, e, flat, 1907, was, swayed, too, much, by, glazunov, s, style, and, disliked, the, modernist, influence, on, faun, and, shepherdess, 1907, however, critics, found, the, works, to, not, stand, out, from, his, teacher, s, music, russian, composers, often, used, large, orchestration, to, feature, many, different, timbres, and, stravinsky, harnessed, this, idea, in, his, first, three, ballets, often, surprising, the, musicians, and, performers, due, to, the, orchestra, s, great, force, at, certain, moments, the, firebird, used, a, harmonic, structure, that, stravinsky, called, leit, harmony, a, portmanteau, of, leitmotif, and, harmony, used, by, rimsky, korsakov, in, his, opera, the, golden, cockerel, the, leit, harmony, was, used, to, juxtapose, the, protagonist, the, firebird, and, the, antagonist, koschei, the, deathless, the, former, was, associated, with, whole, tone, phrases, and, the, latter, with, octatonic, harmony, stravinsky, later, wrote, how, he, composed, the, firebird, in, a, state, of, revolt, against, rimsky, and, that, he, tried, to, surpass, him, with, ponticello, col, legno, flautando, glissando, and, fluttertongue, effects, stravinsky, defined, his, musical, character, in, his, second, ballet, petrushka, the, russian, influence, can, be, seen, in, the, use, of, a, number, of, russian, folk, tunes, in, addition, to, two, waltzes, by, viennese, composer, joseph, lanner, and, a, french, music, hall, tune, stravinsky, also, used, a, folk, tune, from, rimsky, korsakov, s, opera, the, snow, maiden, showing, the, former, s, continued, reverence, for, his, teacher, stravinsky, s, third, ballet, the, rite, of, spring, caused, a, near, riot, at, the, premiere, due, to, its, avant, garde, nature, he, had, begun, to, experiment, with, polytonality, in, the, firebird, and, petrushka, but, for, the, rite, of, spring, he, pushed, to, its, logical, conclusion, as, eric, walter, white, described, it, in, addition, the, complex, meter, in, the, music, consists, of, phrases, combining, conflicting, time, signatures, and, odd, accents, such, as, the, jagged, slashes, in, the, sacrificial, dance, both, polytonality, and, unusual, rhythms, can, be, heard, in, the, chords, that, open, the, second, episode, augurs, of, spring, consisting, of, an, e, flat, dominant, 7, superimposed, on, an, f, flat, major, triad, written, in, an, uneven, rhythm, stravinsky, shifting, the, accents, seemingly, at, random, to, create, asymmetry, the, rite, of, spring, is, one, of, the, most, famous, and, influential, works, of, the, 20th, century, the, musicologist, donald, jay, grout, described, it, as, having, the, effect, of, an, explosion, that, so, scattered, the, elements, of, musical, language, that, they, could, never, again, be, put, together, as, before, the, musicologist, jeremy, noble, said, that, stravinsky, s, intensive, researches, into, russian, folk, material, took, place, during, his, time, in, switzerland, from, 1914, to, 1920, b, la, bart, k, considered, stravinsky, s, russian, period, to, have, begun, in, 1913, with, the, rite, of, spring, due, to, its, use, of, russian, folk, songs, themes, and, techniques, the, use, of, duple, or, triple, meters, was, especially, prevalent, in, stravinsky, s, russian, period, music, while, the, pulse, may, have, remained, constant, the, time, signature, would, often, change, to, constantly, shift, the, accents, while, stravinsky, did, not, use, as, many, folk, melodies, as, he, had, in, his, first, three, ballets, he, often, used, folk, poetry, the, ballet, cantata, les, noces, was, based, on, texts, from, a, collection, of, russian, folk, poetry, by, pyotr, kireevsky, and, his, opera, ballet, renard, was, based, on, a, folktale, collected, by, alexander, afanasyev, many, of, stravinsky, s, russian, period, works, featured, animal, characters, and, themes, likely, due, to, inspiration, from, nursery, rhymes, he, read, with, his, children, stravinsky, also, used, unique, theatrical, styles, les, noces, blended, the, staging, of, ballets, with, the, small, instrumentation, of, early, cantatas, a, unique, production, described, on, the, score, as, russian, choreographic, scenes, in, renard, the, voices, were, placed, in, the, orchestra, as, they, were, meant, to, accompany, the, action, on, stage, l, histoire, du, soldat, was, composed, in, 1918, with, the, swiss, novelist, charles, f, ramuz, as, a, small, musical, theatre, production, for, dancers, a, narrator, and, a, septet, it, mixed, the, russian, folktales, in, the, narrative, with, common, musical, structures, of, the, time, like, the, tango, waltz, rag, and, chorale, even, as, his, style, changed, in, later, years, stravinsky, maintained, a, musical, connection, to, his, russian, roots, the, ballet, pulcinella, was, commissioned, by, diaghilev, in, 1919, after, he, proposed, the, idea, of, a, ballet, based, on, music, by, 18th, century, italian, composers, like, giovanni, battista, pergolesi, by, imposing, a, work, based, on, the, harmonic, and, rhythmic, systems, of, late, baroque, era, composers, stravinsky, marked, the, start, of, his, turn, towards, 18th, century, music, although, the, musicologist, jeremy, noble, considered, stravinsky, s, neoclassical, period, to, have, begun, in, 1920, with, his, symphonies, of, wind, instruments, bart, k, argued, that, the, period, really, starts, with, his, octet, for, wind, instruments, followed, by, his, concerto, for, piano, during, this, period, stravinsky, used, techniques, and, themes, from, the, classical, period, of, music, greek, mythology, was, a, common, theme, in, stravinsky, s, neoclassical, works, his, first, greek, mythology, based, work, was, the, ballet, apollon, musag, te, 1927, choosing, the, leader, of, the, muses, and, the, god, of, art, apollo, as, the, subjects, stravinsky, would, use, themes, from, greek, mythology, in, future, works, like, oedipus, rex, 1927, persephone, 1935, and, orpheus, 1947, richard, taruskin, wrote, that, oedipus, rex, was, the, product, of, stravinsky, s, neo, classical, manner, at, its, most, extreme, and, that, musical, techniques, thought, outdated, were, juxtaposed, against, contemporary, ideas, in, addition, stravinsky, turned, towards, older, musical, structures, and, modernized, them, his, octet, 1923, uses, the, sonata, form, modernizing, it, by, disregarding, the, standard, ordering, of, themes, and, traditional, tonal, relationships, for, different, sections, baroque, counterpoint, was, used, throughout, the, choral, symphony, of, psalms, 1930, in, the, jazz, influenced, ebony, concerto, 1945, stravinsky, fused, big, band, orchestration, with, baroque, forms, and, harmonies, stravinsky, s, neoclassical, period, ended, in, 1951, with, the, opera, the, rake, s, progress, taruskin, described, the, opera, as, the, hub, and, essence, of, neo, classicism, he, pointed, out, how, the, opera, contains, numerous, references, to, greek, mythology, and, other, operas, like, mozart, s, don, giovanni, and, bizet, s, carmen, but, still, embod, the, distinctive, structure, of, a, fairy, tale, stravinsky, was, inspired, by, the, operas, of, mozart, in, composing, the, music, particularly, cos, fan, tutte, but, other, scholars, also, point, out, influence, from, handel, gluck, beethoven, schubert, weber, rossini, donizetti, and, verdi, the, rake, s, progress, has, become, an, important, work, in, opera, repertoire, being, than, any, other, opera, written, after, the, death, of, puccini, according, to, taruskin, in, the, 1950s, stravinsky, began, using, serial, compositional, techniques, such, as, the, twelve, tone, technique, originally, devised, by, arnold, schoenberg, noble, wrote, that, this, time, was, the, most, profound, change, in, stravinsky, s, musical, vocabulary, partly, due, to, stravinsky, s, newfound, interest, in, the, music, of, the, second, viennese, school, after, meeting, robert, craft, the, composer, s, treatment, of, the, twelve, tone, technique, was, unique, whereas, schoenberg, s, technique, was, very, strict, disallowing, repetitions, of, a, tone, row, until, it, was, complete, stravinsky, repeated, notes, freely, even, separating, the, row, into, cells, and, reordering, the, notes, in, addition, his, serial, period, s, orchestration, style, became, dark, and, bass, heavy, with, winds, and, piano, frequently, using, their, lowest, registers, stravinsky, first, experimented, with, non, twelve, tone, serial, techniques, in, small, scale, works, such, as, the, cantata, 1952, the, septet, 1953, and, three, songs, from, shakespeare, 1953, the, first, of, his, compositions, fully, based, on, such, techniques, was, in, memoriam, dylan, thomas, 1954, agon, 1954, 1957, was, the, first, of, his, works, to, include, a, twelve, tone, series, whereas, the, second, movement, from, canticum, sacrum, 1956, was, the, first, piece, to, contain, a, movement, entirely, based, on, a, tone, row, agon, s, unique, tonal, structure, was, significant, to, stravinsky, s, serial, music, it, begins, diatonic, moves, towards, full, 12, tone, serialism, in, the, middle, and, returns, to, diatonicism, in, the, end, stravinsky, returned, to, sacred, themes, in, works, such, as, canticum, sacrum, threni, 1958, a, sermon, a, narrative, and, a, prayer, 1961, and, the, flood, 1962, stravinsky, used, a, number, of, concepts, from, earlier, works, in, his, serial, pieces, for, example, the, voice, of, god, being, two, bass, voices, in, homophony, seen, in, the, flood, was, previously, used, in, les, noces, stravinsky, s, final, large, scale, work, the, requiem, canticles, 1966, made, use, of, a, complex, four, part, array, of, tone, rows, throughout, showing, the, evolution, of, stravinsky, s, serialist, music, noble, described, the, requiem, canticles, as, a, distillation, both, of, the, liturgical, text, and, of, his, own, musical, means, of, setting, it, evolved, and, refined, through, a, career, of, more, than, 60, years, the, influence, of, other, composers, on, stravinsky, can, be, seen, throughout, this, period, he, was, heavily, influenced, by, schoenberg, not, only, in, his, use, of, the, twelve, tone, technique, but, also, in, the, distinctly, schoenbergian, instrumentation, of, the, septet, and, the, similarities, between, schoenberg, s, klangfarbenmelodie, and, stravinsky, s, variations, stravinsky, also, used, a, number, of, themes, found, in, works, by, benjamin, britten, later, commenting, about, the, many, titles, and, subjects, with, mr, britten, already, in, addition, he, was, very, familiar, with, the, works, of, anton, webern, being, one, of, the, figures, who, inspired, stravinsky, to, consider, serialism, a, possible, form, of, composition, stravinsky, worked, with, some, of, the, most, famous, artists, of, his, time, many, of, whom, he, met, after, achieving, international, success, with, the, firebird, diaghilev, was, one, of, the, composer, s, most, prominent, artistic, influences, having, introduced, him, to, composing, for, the, stage, and, bringing, him, international, fame, with, his, first, three, ballets, through, the, ballets, russes, and, diaghilev, stravinsky, worked, with, figures, like, vaslav, nijinsky, l, onide, massine, alexandre, benois, michel, fokine, and, l, on, bakst, the, composer, s, interest, in, art, propelled, him, to, develop, a, strong, relationship, with, picasso, whom, he, met, in, 1917, in, the, years, following, the, two, engaged, in, an, artistic, dialogue, in, which, they, exchanged, small, scale, works, of, art, to, each, other, as, a, sign, of, intimacy, which, included, the, famous, portrait, of, stravinsky, by, picasso, and, a, short, sketch, of, clarinet, music, by, stravinsky, this, exchange, was, essential, to, establish, how, the, artists, would, approach, their, collaborative, space, in, ragtime, and, pulcinella, stravinsky, displayed, a, taste, in, literature, that, was, wide, and, reflected, his, constant, desire, for, new, discoveries, the, texts, and, literary, sources, for, his, work, began, with, interest, in, russian, folklore, after, moving, to, switzerland, in, 1914, stravinsky, began, gathering, folk, stories, from, numerous, collections, which, were, later, used, in, works, like, les, noces, renard, pribaoutki, and, various, songs, many, of, stravinsky, s, works, including, the, firebird, renard, and, l, histoire, du, soldat, were, inspired, by, alexander, afanasyev, s, famous, collection, russian, folk, tales, collections, of, folk, music, influenced, stravinsky, s, music, numerous, melodies, from, the, rite, of, spring, were, found, in, an, anthology, of, lithuanian, folk, songs, an, interest, in, the, latin, liturgy, began, shortly, after, stravinsky, rejoined, the, church, in, 1926, beginning, with, the, composition, of, his, first, religious, work, in, 1926, pater, noster, written, in, old, church, slavonic, he, later, used, three, psalms, from, the, latin, vulgate, in, his, symphony, of, psalms, for, orchestra, and, mixed, choir, many, works, in, the, composer, s, neoclassical, and, serial, periods, used, or, were, based, on, liturgical, texts, stravinsky, worked, with, many, authors, throughout, his, career, he, first, worked, with, the, swiss, novelist, charles, f, ramuz, on, l, histoire, du, soldat, in, 1918, with, whom, he, formed, the, idea, and, wrote, the, text, in, 1933, ida, rubinstein, commissioned, stravinsky, to, set, music, to, a, poem, by, andr, gide, later, becoming, the, melodrama, pers, phone, the, stravinsky, gide, collaboration, was, apparently, tense, gide, disliked, how, the, music, did, not, follow, the, prosody, of, his, poem, and, did, not, attend, rehearsals, and, stravinsky, ignored, many, of, gide, s, ideas, gide, later, left, the, project, and, did, not, attend, the, premiere, run, the, story, of, the, rake, s, progress, was, first, conceived, by, stravinsky, and, w, h, auden, the, latter, of, whom, wrote, the, libretto, with, chester, kallman, stravinsky, befriended, many, other, authors, as, well, including, t, s, eliot, aldous, huxley, christopher, isherwood, and, dylan, thomas, the, last, of, whom, stravinsky, began, working, with, on, an, opera, in, 1953, but, stopped, due, to, thomas, s, death, stravinsky, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, composers, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1998, time, magazine, listed, him, as, one, of, the, 100, most, influential, people, of, the, century, stravinsky, was, not, only, recognized, for, his, composing, he, also, achieved, fame, as, a, pianist, and, as, a, conductor, philip, glass, wrote, in, time, he, conducted, with, an, energy, and, vividness, that, completely, conveyed, his, every, musical, intention, here, was, stravinsky, a, musical, revolutionary, whose, own, evolution, never, stopped, there, is, not, a, composer, who, lived, during, his, time, or, is, alive, today, who, was, not, touched, and, sometimes, transformed, by, his, work, stravinsky, was, also, renowned, for, his, precise, orchestration, the, critic, alexis, roland, manuel, wrote, that, stravinsky, and, the, french, composer, maurice, ravel, were, the, in, the, world, who, best, knows, the, weight, of, a, trombone, note, the, harmonics, of, a, cello, or, a, pp, tam, tam, in, the, relationships, of, one, orchestral, group, to, another, stravinsky, was, noted, for, his, distinctive, use, of, rhythm, especially, in, the, rite, of, spring, the, rhythm, in, the, rite, stretched, across, bars, and, lacked, distinct, beats, which, opened, the, door, for, future, composers, to, make, rhythm, more, fluid, within, meters, however, many, saw, his, subsequent, neoclassical, period, as, a, return, to, the, past, while, other, composers, tried, advancing, modern, music, his, subsequent, turn, towards, serialism, further, alienated, him, from, audiences, and, academics, saw, this, stylistic, shift, as, not, innovative, enough, since, they, believed, the, death, of, schoenberg, also, marked, the, end, of, twelve, tone, music, stephen, walsh, related, the, changing, nature, of, stravinsky, s, music, to, the, composer, s, nature, as, an, exile, from, his, native, russia, stravinsky, adapted, to, his, environment, and, absorbed, the, music, of, those, around, him, martha, hyde, stated, that, more, recent, analysis, judg, stravinsky, s, neoclassical, style, as, the, harbinger, of, musical, postmodernism, after, his, death, stravinsky, s, importance, in, modernist, music, became, evident, though, many, modern, styles, quickly, fell, out, of, fashion, like, twelve, tone, music, the, music, of, stravinsky, stood, out, as, a, body, of, unique, ingenuity, according, to, walsh, stravinsky, influenced, many, composers, and, musicians, his, music, continues, to, offer, inspiration, and, a, unique, method, to, young, composers, the, rhythmic, innovations, in, the, rite, of, spring, brought, rhythm, to, the, forefront, of, modern, music, rather, than, tonality, setting, a, new, standard, in, the, modernist, movement, that, future, composers, like, var, se, and, ligeti, were, inspired, to, innovate, upon, stravinsky, s, rhythm, and, vitality, greatly, influenced, aaron, copland, and, pierre, boulez, and, the, combination, of, folklore, and, modernism, found, in, many, of, stravinsky, s, works, influenced, b, la, bart, k, as, well, stravinsky, s, less, popular, works, were, also, widely, influential, the, disconnected, form, of, the, symphonies, of, wind, instruments, can, be, seen, similarly, in, later, works, by, avant, garde, masters, like, messiaen, tippett, andriessen, and, xenakis, stravinsky, also, influenced, composers, like, elliott, carter, harrison, birtwistle, and, john, tavener, aside, from, craft, his, students, include, robert, strassburg, armando, jos, fernandes, mordecai, seter, and, warren, zevon, stravinsky, s, need, for, money, during, the, world, wars, led, him, to, sign, many, contracts, with, record, companies, to, conduct, his, music, his, early, exposure, to, player, piano, technology, guided, his, view, that, records, were, far, inferior, to, live, performance, but, acted, as, historical, documentation, of, how, his, works, should, be, performed, as, a, result, stravinsky, left, a, massive, archive, of, recordings, of, his, own, music, seldom, recording, music, by, other, composers, although, most, of, his, recordings, were, made, with, studio, musicians,
