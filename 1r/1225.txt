yang, tinghe, proposed, adopting, zhu, houcong, as, the, hongzhi, emperor, s, son, so, he, could, ascend, as, the, late, emperor, s, younger, brother, in, addition, there, were, many, favorites, of, the, deceased, emperor, living, in, beijing, who, were, afraid, of, changes, the, most, influential, among, them, was, general, jiang, bin, the, commander, of, the, border, troops, who, had, been, transferred, to, beijing, it, was, feared, that, he, would, try, to, install, his, own, candidate, for, the, throne, namely, zhu, junzhang, prince, of, dai, who, was, based, in, the, border, city, of, datong, in, the, mentioned, reprimand, king, wen, the, father, of, the, founder, of, the, zhou, dynasty, king, wu, is, also, contrasted, with, the, unworthy, last, shang, king, zhou, the, jiajing, emperor, saw, a, parallel, between, king, wen, zhou, and, wu, and, his, noble, father, unworthy, zhengde, emperor, and, himself, therefore, he, judged, that, he, did, not, owe, the, throne, to, the, grand, secretaries, ministers, or, the, empress, dowager, but, to, the, virtues, of, his, father, recognized, by, the, heavens, this, was, the, basis, of, his, respect, for, his, parents, and, his, rejection, of, adoption, in, the, dispute, over, rituals, the, day, after, the, zhengde, emperor, s, death, a, delegation, of, high, ranking, dignitaries, left, beijing, for, anlu, to, inform, the,

throne, but, zhu, houcong, refused, to, appear, as, the, heir, apparent, stating, that, he, was, invited, to, assume, the, imperial, rank, and, was, therefore, the, emperor, not, the, son, of, the, emperor, according, to, the, grand, secretaries, and, the, government, he, was, the, son, of, the, hongzhi, emperor, he, forced, his, way, into, the, city, with, imperial, honors, and, on, the, same, day, 27, may, 1521, he, ceremoniously, ascended, the, throne, the, young, emperor, reportedly, chose, the, name, of, his, era, himself, from, his, favorite, chapter, of, the, book, of, documents, with, jia, meaning, to, improve, make, splendid, and, jing, meaning, to, pacify, in, chinese, the, primary, desire, of, the, new, emperor, was, to, posthumously, elevate, his, father, to, the, imperial, rank, in, contrast, yang, tinghe, insisted, on, his, formal, adoption, by, the, hongzhi, emperor, in, order, to, legitimize, his, claim, to, the, throne, and, become, the, younger, brother, of, the, late, zhengde, emperor, however, the, jiajing, emperor, and, his, mother, rejected, the, adoption, citing, the, wording, of, the, recall, decree, which, did, not, mention, it, the, emperor, did, not, want, to, declare, his, parents, as, his, uncle, and, aunt, instead, he, requested, the, elevation, of, his, parents, to, the, imperial, status, to, bring, their, ranks, into, line, most, officials, agreed, to, maintain, a, direct, line, of, succession, and, supported, yang, tinghe, but, the, emperor, argued, for, the, duty, to, his, biological, parents, he, insisted, on, his, mother,

of, the, emperor, had, already, formed, in, late, 1521, the, jiajing, emperor, succeeded, in, having, his, parents, and, grandmother, lady, shao, granted, imperial, rank, however, disputes, continued, until, yang, tinghe, was, forced, to, resign, in, march, 1524, and, the, removal, of, the, emperor, s, opponents, began, in, august, 1524, after, a, disapproving, demonstration, by, hundreds, of, opposing, officials, in, front, of, the, gates, of, the, audience, hall, the, opposition, was, beaten, at, court, 17, officials, died, from, their, wounds, and, the, rest, were, exiled, to, the, provinces, by, the, emperor, during, the, dispute, the, jiajing, emperor, asserted, his, independence, from, the, grand, secretaries, and, made, decisions, based, on, his, own, judgment, rather, than, consulting, with, them, or, simply, approving, their, proposals, this, was, seen, as, a, despotic, approach, that, went, against, the, traditional, way, of, governing, and, was, criticized, by, concerned, scholars, as, a, result, of, the, dispute, the, teachings, of, confucian, scholar, and, reformer, wang, yangming, gained, popularity, as, some, of, the, emperor, s, followers, were, influenced, by, his, arguments, additionally, there, was, an, increase, in, critical, analysis, and, interpretation, of, texts, during, discussions, and, there, was, a, growing, criticism, of, the, conservative, attitudes, of, the, hanlin, academy, in, 1530, the, jiajing, emperor, published, the, biography, of, empress, ma, the, gao, huanghou, chuan, and, the, household, instructions, of, empress, xu, under, the, title, n, xun, instructions, for, women, in, 12, volumes, the, work, was, attributed, to, the, emperor, s, mother, empress, ma, was, the, wife, of, the, hongwu, emperor, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, and, empress, xu, was, the, wife, of, the, yongle, emperor, the, first, monarch, in, the, new, branch, of, the, dynasty, additionally, the, emperor, changed, the, yongle, emperor, s, temple, name, from, taizong, to, chengzu, it, is, believed, that, jiajing, s, interest, in, the, yongle, emperor, stemmed, from, the, precedent, of, starting, a, new, branch, of, the, dynasty, the, emperor, also, suggested, transferring, his, father, s, remains, from, the, mausoleum, in, huguang, to, the, vicinity, of, the, imperial, burial, ground, near, beijing, however, in, the, end, only, a, shrine, was, created, for, him, in, the, palace, the, emperor, also, took, steps, to, honor, his, ancestors, such, as, restoring, ancestral, temples, giving, his, parents, longer, titles, and, supervising, rituals, and, ritual, music, after, his, mother, s, death, in, december, 1538, the, emperor, traveled, south, to, anlu, to, resolve, the, question, of, whether, to, bury, his, parents, together, in, the, south, or, in, beijing, he, ultimately, chose, to, bury, his, mother, in, his, father, s, mausoleum, near, zhongxiang, in, honor, of, his, father, he, also, published, his, veritable, records, shilu, and, renamed, anlu, zhou, to, chengtian, prefecture, chengtian, fu, after, the, example, of, the, imperial, capitals, during, his, journey, to, anlu, the, jiajing, emperor, was, shocked, by, the, sight, of, starving, and, impoverished, people, and, refugees, he, immediately, released, 20, thousand, liang, 746, kg, of, silver, for, relief, he, saw, their, suffering, as, a, failure, of, his, ceremonial, and, administrative, reforms, two, years, later, during, civil, service, examinations, he, asked, candidates, why, there, was, still, poverty, in, the, country, despite, his, efforts, to, faithfully, follow, confucian, teachings, and, observe, ceremonies, after, successfully, resolving, the, great, rites, controversy, the, emperor, proceeded, to, make, changes, to, other, rituals, and, ceremonies, despite, facing, opposition, from, some, officials, these, changes, primarily, affected, the, rites, performed, by, the, monarch, in, the, late, 1530s, separate, sacrifices, to, the, heavens, earth, sun, and, moon, were, introduced, additionally, the, jiajing, emperor, altered, the, titles, and, forms, of, honoring, confucius, including, a, ban, on, images, in, confucius, temples, leaving, only, plaques, with, the, names, of, confucius, and, his, followers, the, layout, of, the, temple, of, confucius, was, also, modified, to, include, separate, chapels, for, confucius, father, and, three, disciples, as, part, of, these, changes, confucius, was, stripped, of, his, title, of, king, by, the, jiajing, emperor, who, believed, that, the, emperor, should, not, bow, to, a, king, furthermore, the, emperor, did, not, want, confucius, to, be, worshipped, in, the, same, rituals, used, for, imperial, sacrifices, to, the, heavens, as, a, result, the, ceremonies, in, the, temple, of, confucius, were, simplified, and, no, longer, resembled, imperial, sacrifices, in, addition, sacrifices, to, former, emperors, and, kings, were, separated, from, the, imperial, sacrifices, to, the, heavens, and, a, special, temple, was, built, for, them, this, elevated, the, status, of, the, monarch, as, his, rites, were, now, distinct, from, all, others, however, from, the, years, 1532, 1533, the, jiajing, emperor, lost, interest, in, ritual, reforms, and, the, worship, of, heaven, as, he, was, no, longer, able, to, elevate, his, own, or, his, father, s, status, this, led, to, a, decline, in, the, importance, of, ceremonies, during, his, reign, important, positions, in, the, imperial, palace, were, filled, by, eunuchs, brought, from, anlu, by, the, jiajing, emperor, as, part, of, the, dismissal, of, eunuchs, associated, with, the, previous, monarch, some, eunuch, posts, in, the, provinces, were, eliminated, however, the, overall, influence, of, eunuchs, did, not, decrease, in, fact, it, continued, to, grow, by, the, 1530s, the, most, influential, eunuchs, saw, themselves, as, equal, to, the, grand, secretaries, in, 1548, 1549, the, roles, of, the, head, of, the, eastern, depot, and, the, directorate, of, ceremonial, were, combined, and, the, palace, guard, established, in, 1552, and, composed, of, eunuchs, was, also, under, their, control, this, effectively, placed, the, entire, eunuch, branch, of, state, administration, under, their, management, early, in, the, emperors, reign, selected, eunuchs, from, the, directorate, of, ceremonial, aided, the, emperor, in, practicing, calligraphy, these, eunuchs, accompanied, the, emperor, to, study, after, court, sessions, the, eunuchs, and, the, emperor, would, read, aloud, at, least, ten, times, the, text, of, the, book, assigned, in, a, given, session, the, eunuchs, were, to, ensure, the, emperor, thoroughly, understood, after, 1524, the, emperor, s, closest, advisers, were, zhang, fujing, and, gui, e, they, attempted, to, remove, followers, of, yang, tinghe, who, were, associated, with, the, hanlin, academy, from, influential, positions, this, resulted, in, a, purge, of, the, beijing, authorities, in, 1527, 1528, and, a, significant, change, in, personnel, at, the, academy, in, addition, zhang, fujing, and, gui, e, worked, to, limit, the, influence, of, senior, grand, secretary, fei, hong, in, the, grand, secretariat, to, balance, this, they, brought, back, yang, yiqing, who, had, previously, served, in, the, grand, secretariat, in, 1515, 1516, in, the, following, years, there, was, a, power, struggle, between, the, grand, secretaries, and, their, associated, groups, of, officials, the, position, of, senior, grand, secretary, was, constantly, changing, with, fei, hong, yang, yiqing, zhang, fujing, and, others, taking, turns, in, the, early, 1530s, the, jiajing, emperor, s, trust, was, won, by, xia, yan, who, had, been, promoted, from, minister, of, rites, to, grand, secretary, later, in, the, late, 1530s, yan, song, xia, yan, s, successor, in, the, ministry, also, gained, the, jiajing, emperor, s, trust, however, despite, initially, supporting, yan, song, s, rise, xia, yan, and, yan, song, eventually, came, into, conflict, in, 1542, yan, song, was, able, to, oust, xia, yan, and, take, control, of, the, grand, secretariat, in, an, attempt, to, counterbalance, yan, song, s, influence, the, emperor, called, xia, yan, back, to, lead, the, grand, secretariat, in, october, 1545, however, the, two, statesmen, were, at, odds, with, xia, yan, ignoring, yan, song, refusing, to, consult, him, and, canceling, his, appointment, as, a, result, the, emperor, grew, distant, from, xia, yan, partly, due, to, his, reserved, attitude, towards, taoist, rituals, and, prayers, in, contrast, yan, song, strongly, supported, the, emperor, s, interest, in, taoism, in, february, 1548, xia, yan, supported, a, campaign, to, ordos, without, informing, yan, song, making, him, solely, responsible, for, it, when, the, emperor, withdrew, his, support, for, the, campaign, due, to, unfavorable, omens, and, reports, of, discontent, in, the, neighboring, province, of, shaanxi, enemies, of, xia, yan, including, yan, song, used, this, as, an, opportunity, to, bring, charges, against, him, and, have, him, executed, from, 1549, to, 1562, the, grand, secretariat, was, under, the, control, of, yan, song, he, was, known, for, his, attentiveness, and, diligence, towards, the, monarch, but, also, for, pushing, his, colleagues, out, of, power, despite, facing, numerous, political, crises, and, challenges, yan, song, managed, to, survive, by, delegating, decisions, and, responsibilities, to, the, appropriate, ministries, and, authorities, for, example, the, ministry, of, rites, was, responsible, for, dealing, with, the, mongols, while, the, ministry, of, war, handled, their, expulsion, however, yan, song, avoided, getting, involved, in, the, government, s, biggest, issue, at, the, time, state, finances, leaving, it, to, the, ministries, of, revennue, and, works, he, only, maintained, control, over, personnel, matters, and, selected, political, issues, despite, facing, criticism, for, corruption, and, selling, offices, yan, song, was, able, to, convince, the, emperor, that, these, were, false, accusations, and, that, his, critics, were, simply, trying, to, remove, him, from, power, the, emperor, who, was, always, suspicious, of, officials, believed, yan, song, s, defense, yan, song, who, was, already, eighty, years, old, in, 1560, was, unable, to, continue, his, role, as, grand, secretary, this, was, especially, true, after, his, wife, died, in, 1561, and, his, son, who, had, been, assisting, him, with, writing, edicts, went, home, to, organize, the, funeral, to, make, matters, worse, he, faced, opposition, from, his, subordinate, grand, secretary, xu, jie, as, a, result, the, emperor, no, longer, relied, on, yan, song, and, dismissed, him, in, june, 1562, xu, jie, then, took, over, as, the, head, of, the, grand, secretariat, with, the, personnel, changes, in, the, immediate, surroundings, of, the, emperor, the, focus, and, style, of, his, policies, also, shifted, during, the, first, phase, of, his, reign, the, jiajing, emperor, placed, great, importance, on, ceremonies, which, were, seen, as, essential, in, maintaining, order, and, promoting, a, sense, of, superiority, over, non, chinese, peoples, according, to, confucian, beliefs, the, refinement, and, organization, of, these, ceremonies, aimed, to, showcase, the, ming, dynasty, as, a, model, for, surrounding, countries, and, the, world, the, emperor, received, significant, assistance, from, his, senior, grand, secretary, zhang, fujing, however, during, xia, yan, s, dominance, in, the, grand, secretariat, the, emperor, withdrew, from, the, forbidden, city, to, the, west, park, neglecting, his, public, duties, but, still, maintaining, control, over, the, government, during, this, time, ming, china, used, military, force, to, intimidate, neighboring, countries, successfully, in, the, case, of, vietnam, but, falling, in, the, attempt, to, recapture, ordos, resulting, in, xia, yan, s, death, in, 1548, in, the, following, period, during, the, conflicts, of, the, 1550s, in, the, north, and, on, the, coast, yan, song, pursued, a, policy, of, compromise, and, negotiation, which, was, accompanied, by, corruption, after, the, fall, of, yan, song, in, 1562, the, emperor, s, interest, in, good, governance, was, rekindled, under, the, influence, of, the, capable, and, energetic, grand, secretary, xu, jie, thus, the, jiajing, emperor, s, rule, after, the, overthrow, of, yang, tinghe, can, be, divided, into, four, phases, zhang, fujing, s, strict, adherence, to, ideology, xia, yan, s, aggressive, expansionism, yan, song, s, complacent, corruption, and, xu, jie, s, corrective, reforms, one, important, aspect, of, the, decision, making, process, since, the, beginning, of, the, ming, dynasty, has, been, the, system, of, interdepartmental, consultation, among, high, officials, memoranda, and, proposals, were, submitted, for, debate, to, the, nine, ministers, as, well, as, to, generals, of, the, central, military, commissions, and, other, officials, the, result, of, these, discussions, was, then, presented, to, the, emperor, for, a, final, decision, the, grand, secretaries, were, responsible, for, organizing, the, circulation, of, these, memoranda, but, did, not, have, the, authority, to, make, decisions, the, jiajing, emperor, emphasized, the, importance, of, discussing, important, decisions, at, court, and, encouraged, officials, to, express, their, opinions, particularly, in, the, case, of, high, ranking, government, officials, to, the, obligee, however, in, the, early, ming, period, this, system, often, served, to, justify, the, decisions, of, the, emperors, especially, after, the, crisis, of, 1380, as, there, was, no, social, basis, for, diverse, attitudes, however, as, the, crises, of, the, mid, 15th, century, emerged, the, situation, changed, and, the, need, for, political, changes, became, apparent, the, emergence, of, officials, with, merchant, family, backgrounds, also, provided, a, basis, for, assessing, problems, from, different, perspectives, officials, used, this, system, to, debate, build, support, networks, lobby, for, their, own, interests, push, opponents, out, of, office, and, sometimes, even, sabotage, their, policies, the, emperor, s, harsh, treatment, of, dissenters, earned, him, many, opponents, and, led, to, multiple, attempts, on, his, life, in, 1539, while, traveling, to, anlu, his, temporary, residences, were, repeatedly, set, on, fire, the, most, serious, incident, occurred, on, 27, november, 1542, when, a, group, of, palace, women, attempted, to, strangle, him, when, the, emperor, had, fallen, asleep, in, one, of, his, concubines, quarters, a, serving, girl, led, several, palace, women, to, start, strangling, him, with, a, silk, cord, however, one, of, the, palace, women, panicked, and, alerted, the, eunuchs, who, then, informed, empress, fang, the, emperor, eventually, woke, up, after, being, unconscious, for, eight, hours, but, was, unable, to, speak, empress, fang, ordered, the, execution, of, all, women, involved, in, the, assassination, attempt, both, those, who, were, actually, involved, and, those, who, were, falsely, accused, the, motives, of, palace, women, are, unclear, but, it, is, possible, that, the, emperor, s, cruel, treatment, towards, them, possibly, in, his, pursuit, of, a, longer, life, may, have, played, a, role, after, the, assassination, attempt, the, jiajing, emperor, completely, withdrew, from, the, formal, life, of, the, court, and, the, forbidden, city, he, moved, to, the, yongshou, palace, palace, of, eternal, life, in, the, west, park, of, the, imperial, city, where, he, occasionally, stayed, starting, in, 1539, the, west, park, was, located, in, the, western, third, of, the, imperial, city, separated, from, it, and, the, forbidden, city, by, a, system, of, three, lakes, called, taiye, lake, these, lakes, stretched, over, two, kilometers, from, north, to, south, and, occupied, half, of, the, park, s, area, the, emperor, built, west, park, to, be, a, complex, where, he, could, live, and, seek, immortality, since, the, beginning, of, the, ming, dynasty, west, park, has, been, seen, as, a, symbol, of, the, lands, of, immortals, the, jiajing, emperor, who, was, fascinated, by, taoism, and, the, concept, of, immortality, was, intrigued, by, this, and, attempted, to, reconstruct, the, site, in, accordance, with, contemporary, beliefs, about, the, lands, of, immortals, he, aligned, the, names, of, the, palaces, and, the, attire, of, the, servants, and, officials, with, taoist, symbolism, and, taoist, ceremonies, were, performed, animals, were, also, kept, and, plants, were, grown, for, divination, purposes, however, after, the, emperor, s, death, most, of, the, buildings, he, had, constructed, were, demolished, leaving, only, one, temple, dagaoxian, dian, which, still, stands, today, after, 1542, the, emperor, never, resided, in, his, palace, in, the, forbidden, city, this, relocation, to, the, west, park, also, resulted, in, the, transfer, of, the, administrative, center, of, the, empire, further, isolating, the, emperor, from, the, bureaucracy, in, fact, as, early, as, 1534, he, ceased, holding, imperial, audiences, instead, his, decisions, were, conveyed, to, the, ministries, and, other, authorities, through, a, select, group, of, advisors, who, had, direct, access, to, him, this, group, included, the, grand, secretaries, the, minister, of, rites, and, several, military, commanders, however, the, discontinuation, of, audiences, did, not, indicate, a, lack, of, interest, in, governing, the, emperor, diligently, read, reports, and, submissions, from, officials, and, often, worked, late, into, the, night, from, the, beginning, of, his, reign, the, jiajing, emperor, was, drawn, to, the, taoist, faith, with, its, focus, on, supernaturalism, and, the, pursuit, of, immortality, this, may, have, been, influenced, by, his, childhood, spent, in, huguang, where, the, people, were, known, for, their, superstitious, beliefs, however, the, jiajing, emperor, s, support, of, taoism, was, not, without, limits, in, 1527, ministers, and, grand, secretaries, gui, e, fang, xianfu, yang, yiqing, and, huo, tao, proposed, stricter, regulations, for, the, establishment, of, new, taoist, and, buddhist, temples, and, monasteries, they, also, suggested, the, abolition, of, nunneries, and, temples, the, confiscation, of, their, property, and, the, return, of, buddhist, and, taoist, nuns, and, priests, to, secular, life, the, emperor, signed, the, decree, that, was, prepared, however, as, the, jiajing, emperor, had, no, heir, in, the, first, ten, years, of, his, reign, some, high, ranking, officials, suggested, that, taoist, prayers, and, rituals, could, solve, the, problem, this, piqued, his, interest, which, only, intensified, after, the, assassination, in, 1542, the, jiajing, emperor, spared, no, expense, or, time, for, taoist, ceremonies, the, taoists, requested, among, other, things, tens, of, kilograms, of, gold, dust, for, their, prayers, the, emperor, even, had, temples, built, for, them, which, required, a, lot, of, wood, to, be, transported, from, distant, sichuan, additionally, he, gave, them, valuable, items, among, the, taoists, shao, yuanjie, was, particularly, favored, by, the, emperor, starting, in, 1526, shao, yuanjie, was, known, for, his, prayers, for, rain, and, protection, against, calamities, after, the, birth, of, the, emperor, s, first, sons, the, eldest, died, young, in, 1533, and, the, second, was, born, in, 1536, he, was, highly, honored, however, shao, yuanjie, died, in, 1539, and, was, replaced, by, tao, zhongwen, tao, zhongwen, further, strengthened, the, emperor, s, faith, in, taoism, and, gained, respect, for, himself, by, accurately, predicting, a, fire, on, the, way, south, to, anlu, in, order, to, prolong, the, emperor, s, life, tao, zhongwen, offered, him, aphrodisiacs, and, elixirs, of, immortality, made, from, surite, and, arsenic, in, september, 1540, the, emperor, announced, his, plans, to, withdraw, into, private, life, in, the, coming, years, to, seek, immortality, this, caused, great, concern, among, officials, who, criticized, the, preparations, as, toxic, those, who, openly, criticized, the, emperor, were, executed, and, in, the, following, decades, he, slowly, consumed, the, elixirs, after, 1545, the, emperor, began, to, rely, on, oracles, for, guidance, in, state, affairs, these, oracles, were, organized, by, tao, zhongwen, who, had, control, over, their, results, yan, song, also, participated, in, divination, seeing, it, as, an, opportunity, to, influence, politics, in, a, favorable, direction, the, emperor, s, pursuit, of, immortality, included, engaging, in, sexual, relations, with, young, girls, of, which, he, and, tao, zhongwen, collected, 960, for, this, purpose, he, also, called, on, officials, throughout, the, country, to, search, for, and, send, magical, herbs, however, after, tao, zhongwen, s, death, in, november, 1560, the, emperor, struggled, to, find, a, taoist, adept, who, could, meet, his, needs, in, addition, to, taoist, prayers, the, literary, form, of, qingci, a, poetic, style, of, prayer, full, of, allusions, was, revived, and, developed, the, emperor, s, favor, with, officials, was, often, based, on, their, skill, in, writing, in, this, style, rather, than, their, statesmanship, yan, song, and, xia, yan, who, were, particularly, skilled, in, this, style, were, often, referred, to, contemptuously, as, qingci, zaixiang, qingci, premiers, during, the, reign, of, the, jiajing, emperor, the, climate, was, cooler, and, wetter, compared, to, previous, years, however, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, there, were, warmer, winters, temperatures, were, 1, 5, degrees, lower, than, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, south, and, north, of, china, were, affected, by, floods, while, the, yangtze, river, basin, experienced, severe, drought, in, 1528, the, worst, drought, of, the, entire, ming, era, hit, zhejiang, shanxi, shaanxi, and, hubei, resulting, in, the, death, of, half, of, the, population, in, some, areas, of, henan, and, jiangnan, jiangnan, continued, to, suffer, from, droughts, epidemics, rains, and, famines, until, the, late, 1540s, earthquakes, were, also, a, frequent, occurrence, during, the, jiajing, emperor, s, reign, with, many, recorded, in, various, areas, for, instance, in, the, span, of, ten, months, from, july, 1523, to, may, 1524, there, were, 38, recorded, earthquakes, in, nanjing, alone, there, were, fifteen, in, just, one, month, in, 1525, the, most, devastating, earthquake, occurred, on, 23, january, 1556, affecting, the, provinces, of, shaanxi, shanxi, and, henan, in, shaanxi, entire, regions, such, as, weinan, huazhou, chaoyi, and, sanyuan, were, left, in, ruins, the, yellow, river, and, the, wei, river, also, overflowed, and, some, areas, experienced, tremors, for, several, days, the, disaster, claimed, the, lives, of, 830, 000, people, including, several, former, ministers, as, a, result, the, affected, areas, were, granted, tax, forgiveness, for, several, years, despite, facing, occasional, challenges, from, nature, the, first, half, of, the, 16th, century, saw, significant, economic, growth, in, agriculture, and, crafts, however, the, state, struggled, to, collect, taxes, particularly, from, newly, cultivated, land, trade, and, handicraft, production, the, quotas, and, revenues, set, a, century, earlier, were, not, met, during, the, jiajing, era, chinese, peasants, began, to, expand, their, agricultural, crops, to, include, species, native, to, central, and, south, america, in, the, 1530s, groundnut, cultivation, was, documented, in, jiangnan, having, spread, there, from, fujian, it, is, believed, that, fujian, peasants, acquired, it, from, portuguese, sailors, sweet, potatoes, were, documented, in, yunnan, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1560s, having, arrived, via, burma, their, presence, on, the, southeast, coast, fujian, and, guangdong, was, only, mentioned, by, authors, of, the, time, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 16th, century, during, the, wanli, era, maize, cultivation, was, documented, as, early, as, the, 1550s, in, inland, henan, but, it, was, most, likely, acquired, from, europeans, several, decades, earlier, it, was, also, sent, by, yunnan, natives, to, beijing, as, part, of, tribute, before, the, mid, 16th, century, however, maize, was, not, well, liked, by, the, chinese, and, its, cultivation, remained, the, concern, of, minority, peoples, in, southwest, china, for, nearly, three, centuries, it, was, only, in, the, 18th, century, that, it, began, to, be, grown, on, a, larger, scale, in, chinese, populated, regions, yang, tinghe, upon, the, accession, of, the, jiajing, emperor, implemented, a, program, of, severe, austerity, this, was, in, response, to, the, significant, increase, in, the, number, of, state, paid, dignitaries, during, the, previous, century, the, number, of, officers, rose, from, less, than, 13, 000, at, the, beginning, of, the, hongwu, emperor, s, reign, 1368, 1398, to, 28, 000, by, the, end, and, eventually, reached, 100, 000, in, 1520, many, of, them, lived, in, and, around, the, capital, many, of, these, officers, were, surplus, and, did, not, actively, serve, in, the, military, the, same, was, true, for, civil, servants, resulting, in, a, total, of, around, 4, million, tons, of, grain, being, imported, to, beijing, each, year, to, support, the, needs, of, civil, servants, soldiers, and, officers, this, grain, was, distributed, at, a, rate, of, 1, ton, 107, 4, liters, per, person, per, month, providing, for, approximately, 300, 000, individuals, in, 1522, yang, tinghe, took, decisive, action, by, cutting, off, payments, to, 148, 700, supernumerary, and, honorary, officers, and, officials, resulting, in, an, annual, reduction, of, 1, 5, million, tons, of, grain, in, state, expenditure, this, move, proved, to, be, beneficial, in, the, mid, 16th, century, as, the, savings, allowed, the, authorities, to, convert, the, 1, 5, million, tons, of, grain, tax, into, a, silver, tax, greatly, improving, the, state, s, finances, in, the, mid, 1520s, despite, efforts, to, save, money, the, state, s, financial, situation, remained, problematic, the, costly, construction, projects, during, the, early, years, of, the, jiajing, era, had, depleted, the, grain, supplies, from, 8, 9, years, worth, of, expenditure, to, only, 3, years, as, well, as, the, silver, reserves, that, had, been, accumulated, in, the, 1520s, in, 1540, the, minister, of, revennue, was, dismissed, for, refusing, to, agree, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, workers, on, public, works, which, already, numbered, 40, 000, he, argued, that, the, cost, of, reconstructing, palaces, ceremonial, altars, and, temples, had, already, reached, 6, million, liang, 224, tons, of, silver, since, the, beginning, of, the, jiajing, emperor, s, reign, and, that, he, did, not, have, the, means, to, sustain, such, a, pace, of, construction, while, the, emperor, did, cancel, some, projects, the, most, expensive, buildings, in, the, west, park, were, not, among, them, the, revenue, of, the, taichang, treasury, which, consisted, of, the, ministry, of, revennue, s, income, in, silver, averaged, 2, million, liang, 74, 6, tons, per, year, after, 1532, out, of, this, amount, 1, 3, million, liang, was, allocated, for, border, defense, however, in, the, 1540s, the, annual, silver, expenditure, increased, to, 3, 47, million, liang, resulting, in, a, deficit, of, 1, 4, million, the, ministry, of, revennue, attempted, to, address, this, issue, by, implementing, stricter, monitoring, of, income, and, expenses, as, well, as, requiring, final, accounts, to, be, presented, at, the, end, of, each, year, despite, these, efforts, the, deficits, persisted, in, 1541, 1, 2, million, tans, of, grain, surplus, which, was, a, result, of, yang, tinghe, s, austerity, measures, were, converted, into, silver, payments, however, this, decision, was, later, revoked, after, five, years, but, was, eventually, reinstated, this, led, to, an, increase, in, the, annual, revenue, of, the, taichang, treasury, from, 2, to, more, than, 3, million, liang, in, the, early, 1550s, from, 1540, onwards, the, conversion, of, taxes, from, grain, to, silver, became, widespread, although, the, specific, proportion, and, method, of, conversion, varied, among, different, counties, in, the, 1550s, state, expenditures, both, regular, and, extraordinary, increased, significantly, the, cost, of, maintaining, military, garrisons, on, the, northern, border, doubled, and, the, state, faced, additional, financial, burdens, due, to, the, earthquake, of, 1556, and, the, fire, that, destroyed, three, audience, palaces, and, the, southern, gate, of, the, forbidden, city, in, 1557, the, reconstruction, of, these, palaces, took, five, years, and, cost, hundreds, of, thousands, of, liang, of, silver, unfortunately, in, 1561, the, emperor, s, palace, in, the, west, park, which, had, also, been, recently, rebuilt, burned, down, again, during, this, time, the, state, s, annual, expenditure, in, silver, ranged, from, 3, to, 6, million, liang, while, the, proper, revenue, was, only, around, 3, million, to, make, up, for, the, shortfall, the, state, resorted, to, extraordinary, taxes, savings, and, even, transfers, from, the, emperor, s, personal, treasury, which, often, left, it, completely, depleted, in, 1552, the, minister, of, revennue, proposed, an, additional, tax, of, two, million, liang, to, be, imposed, on, the, wealthy, prefectures, of, jiangnan, the, emperor, agreed, and, this, procedure, was, repeated, however, during, the, 1550s, jiangnan, was, frequently, attacked, by, pirates, and, also, suffered, from, natural, disasters, making, it, difficult, to, collect, even, the, usual, taxes, the, local, authorities, were, exhausted, and, lacked, the, resources, to, deal, with, floods, and, crop, failures, and, the, government, did, not, respond, until, the, situation, became, dire, and, refugees, along, with, epidemics, appeared, on, the, streets, of, beijing, to, fund, military, operations, in, southeastern, china, taxes, were, levied, in, the, affected, regions, often, in, the, form, of, labor, surcharges, these, taxes, remained, in, place, until, some, of, them, totaling, 400, 500, thousand, liang, were, abolished, in, 1562, savings, and, frugality, also, had, negative, consequences, in, 1560, the, market, price, of, rice, doubled, to, 0, 8, liang, of, silver, per, tan, leading, to, a, revolt, by, the, nanjing, garrison, to, appease, them, 40, thousand, liang, 1492, kg, of, silver, was, distributed, and, the, soldiers, were, not, punished, another, issue, was, the, salaries, of, members, of, the, imperial, family, which, exceeded, 8, 5, million, tons, of, grain, in, the, early, 1560s, and, were, still, insufficient, for, the, large, number, of, family, members, this, problem, was, brought, to, the, attention, of, the, emperor, who, discussed, it, but, took, no, action, in, 1564, 140, members, of, the, imperial, family, gathered, in, front, of, the, governor, s, palace, in, shensi, to, demand, payment, of, their, arrears, which, amounted, to, over, 600, 000, tons, of, grain, however, the, local, authorities, were, only, able, to, collect, 78, 000, liang, of, silver, as, a, result, the, emperor, excluded, those, involved, from, the, imperial, family, but, the, issue, persisted, the, government, s, need, for, silver, revenue, prompted, the, implementation, of, the, single, whip, reform, beginning, in, the, south, east, coast, where, there, was, a, surplus, of, silver, due, to, the, flourishing, trade, industry, during, the, period, of, 1530s, to, 1570s, the, primary, source, of, silver, for, china, was, western, japan, where, new, deposits, were, found, in, the, 1550s, and, 1560s, chinese, merchants, faced, restricted, access, to, japan, due, to, conflicts, on, the, chinese, coast, as, a, result, the, portuguese, took, on, the, role, of, intermediary, between, japan, and, china, the, reforms, known, as, the, single, whip, reform, encompassed, a, variety, of, measures, that, were, implemented, in, different, locations, and, combinations, these, measures, included, the, replacement, of, taxpayers, with, compulsory, labor, for, land, assignments, the, introduction, of, annual, payments, instead, of, the, previous, ten, year, levy, cycle, of, the, lijia, system, the, substitution, of, compulsory, labor, tax, payments, the, consolidation, of, various, fees, and, mandatory, services, into, a, single, payment, and, the, simplification, of, land, categorization, in, 1522, a, new, method, of, calculating, taxes, was, implemented, initially, in, one, county, this, method, took, into, account, the, fertility, of, newly, fertilized, land, and, the, conversion, of, field, area, to, fiscal, mu, making, it, easier, for, taxpayers, to, calculate, their, taxes, this, method, became, popular, in, both, the, north, and, south, but, the, government, had, mixed, feelings, about, it, on, one, hand, it, simplified, the, tax, calculation, process, but, on, the, other, hand, it, relied, on, lower, ranking, officials, who, were, known, for, their, corrupt, practices, as, a, result, the, government, would, sometimes, support, and, other, times, ban, this, method, the, adjustments, and, equalization, of, taxes, also, had, a, positive, impact, on, land, prices, and, market, activity, in, some, cases, the, implementation, of, new, local, cadastres, led, to, households, acquiring, land, registers, replacing, the, outdated, yellow, registers, during, the, early, years, of, the, jiajing, emperor, s, reign, the, statesman, and, philosopher, wang, yangming, d, 1529, was, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, although, he, did, not, participate, in, the, rites, dispute, his, disciples, were, sympathetic, towards, the, emperor, s, following, of, the, inner, moral, voice, despite, his, previous, success, in, quelling, the, rebellion, of, the, prince, of, ning, wang, had, been, dismissed, from, his, position, in, the, civil, service, under, the, zhengde, emperor, however, in, 1525, the, minister, of, rites, xi, shu, proposed, his, reinstatement, due, to, his, exceptional, reputation, as, a, statesman, unfortunately, this, proposal, faced, opposition, from, grand, secretaries, gui, e, and, yang, yiqing, whose, influence, would, diminish, with, wang, s, return, to, beijing, as, a, result, they, suggested, sending, him, to, the, southeast, to, suppress, the, rebellion, in, guangxi, wang, yangming, s, new, concept, of, neo, confucian, philosophy, centered, on, the, concept, of, xin, heart, mind, was, met, with, criticism, from, representatives, of, the, official, zhusist, orthodoxy, as, a, result, his, teachings, were, banned, and, he, was, only, rehabilitated, in, 1567, after, the, death, of, the, jiajing, emperor, however, despite, this, setback, his, ideas, continued, to, spread, throughout, the, country, as, his, teachings, gained, popularity, his, followers, formed, various, regional, schools, the, jiangzhou, school, led, by, figures, such, as, luo, hongxian, zuo, shouyi, ouyang, de, and, nie, bao, provided, the, most, accurate, interpretation, of, wang, s, ideas, the, taizhou, school, on, the, other, hand, led, by, wang, gen, he, xinyin, and, others, took, a, more, radical, approach, some, neo, confucians, disagreed, with, the, views, of, either, wang, yangming, or, zhu, xi, on, the, origin, of, the, universe, instead, they, focused, on, elaborating, the, concept, of, qi, for, example, wang, tingxiang, drew, inspiration, from, the, ideas, of, zhang, zai, of, song, and, xue, xuan, of, ming, he, argued, that, the, universe, did, not, arise, from, the, principle, of, li, but, from, the, primordial, energy, of, qi, yuan, qi, similarly, luo, qinshun, believed, that, energy, was, the, primordial, force, while, principle, served, as, the, source, of, order, and, regularity, both, of, these, thinkers, aimed, to, shift, philosophy, from, moralizing, to, empiricism, a, direction, that, would, become, prevalent, in, chinese, confucianism, a, century, later, during, the, early, qing, period, during, the, jiajing, era, the, epicenter, of, artistic, creativity, was, in, the, wealthy, jiangnan, region, particularly, in, suzhou, this, area, attracted, intellectuals, who, prioritized, artistic, self, expression, over, pursuing, an, official, career, these, intellectuals, were, known, as, the, wu, school, named, after, the, region, s, old, name, the, most, prominent, and, representative, painters, of, the, wu, school, were, wen, zhengming, and, chen, chun, wen, zhengming, was, a, master, of, poetry, calligraphy, and, painting, he, was, known, for, his, monochrome, or, lightly, colored, landscapes, in, the, style, of, shen, zhou, as, well, as, his, blue, green, landscapes, in, the, tang, style, he, is, credited, with, reviving, the, tradition, of, southern, amateur, painting, chen, chun, a, disciple, of, wen, zhengming, brought, originality, to, the, genre, of, flowers, and, birds, he, was, also, renowned, for, his, conceptual, writing, as, a, calligrapher, wen, zhengming, had, many, disciples, and, followers, including, his, sons, and, the, painters, wen, peng, and, wen, jia, wen, peng, in, addition, to, his, skills, in, conceptual, writing, gained, recognition, for, his, seal, carving, other, notable, painters, from, the, wu, school, include, wen, zhengming, s, relative, wen, boren, as, well, as, qian, gu, and, lu, zhi, many, artists, such, as, qiu, ying, and, xu, wei, were, influenced, by, the, wu, school, but, did, not, belong, to, it, they, worked, in, suzhou, and, its, surrounding, areas, qiu, ying, was, part, of, the, conservative, wing, of, the, southern, tradition, while, xu, wei, broke, away, from, this, conservative, expression, his, paintings, are, characterized, by, a, deliberate, carelessness, and, simplification, of, form, resulting, in, exceptional, credibility, and, expressiveness, in, his, compositions, qiu, ying, s, works, were, more, popular, among, the, general, public, than, the, work, of, scholars, and, officials, known, as, literary, painting, as, a, result, merchants, often, signed, his, paintings, in, his, name, even, if, they, were, far, from, his, style, consorts, and, issue
