euclid, j, u, k, l, d, greek, fl, 300, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, mathematician, active, as, a, geometer, and, logician, considered, the, father, of, geometry, he, is, chiefly, known, for, the, elements, treatise, which, established, the, foundations, of, geometry, that, largely, dominated, the, field, until, the, early, 19th, century, his, system, now, referred, to, as, euclidean, geometry, involved, new, innovations, in, combination, with, a, synthesis, of, theories, from, earlier, greek, mathematicians, including, eudoxus, of, cnidus, hippocrates, of, chios, thales, and, theaetetus, with, archimedes, and, apollonius, of, perga, euclid, is, generally, considered, among, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, antiquity, and, one, of, the, most, influential, in, the, history, of, mathematics, very, little, is, known, of, euclid, s, life, and, most, information, comes, from, the, scholars, proclus, and, pappus, of, alexandria, many, centuries, later, medieval, islamic, mathematicians, invented, a, fanciful, biography, and, medieval, byzantine, and, early, renaissance, scholars, mistook, him, for, the, earlier, philosopher, euclid, of, megara, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, he, spent, his, career, in, alexandria, and, lived, around, 300, bc, after, plato, s, students, and, before, archimedes, there, is, some, speculation, that, euclid, studied, at, the, platonic, academy, and, later, taught, at, the, musaeum, he, is, regarded, as, bridging, the, earlier, platonic, tradition, in, athens, with, the, later, tradition, of, alexandria, in, the, elements, euclid, deduced, the, theorems, from, a, small, set, of, axioms, he, also, wrote, works, on, perspective, conic, sections, spherical, geometry, number, theory, and, mathematical, rigour, in, addition, to, the, elements, euclid, wrote, a, central, early, text, in, the, optics, field, optics, and, lesser, known, works, including, data, and, phaenomena, euclid, s, authorship, of, on, divisions, of, figures, and, catoptrics, has, been, questioned, he, is, thought, to, have, written, many, lost, works, the, english, name, euclid, is, the, anglicized, version, of, the, ancient, greek, name, eukle, des, it, is, derived, from, eu, well, and, kl, s, fame, meaning, renowned, glorious, in, english, by, metonymy, euclid, can, mean, his, most, well, known, work, euclid, s, elements, or, a, copy, thereof, and, is, sometimes, synonymous, with, geometry, as, with, many, ancient, greek, mathematicians, the, details, of, euclid, s, life, are, mostly, unknown, he, is, accepted, as, the, author, of, four, mostly, extant, treatises, the, elements, optics, data, phaenomena, but, besides, this, there, is, nothing, known, for, certain, of, him, the, traditional, narrative, mainly, follows, the, 5th, century, ad, account, by, proclus, in, his, commentary, on, the, first, book, of, euclid, s, elements, as, well, as, a, few, anecdotes, from, pappus, of, alexandria, in, the, early, 4th, century, according, to, proclus, euclid, lived, shortly, after, several, of, plato, s, d, 347, bc, followers, and, before, the, mathematician, archimedes, c, 287, c, 212, bc, specifically, proclus, placed, euclid, during, the, rule, of, ptolemy, i, r, 305, 304, 282, bc, euclid, s, birthdate, is, unknown, some, scholars, estimate, around, 330, or, 325, bc, but, others, refrain, from, speculating, it, is, presumed, that, he, was, of, greek, descent, but, his, birthplace, is, unknown, proclus, held, that, euclid, followed, the, platonic, tradition, but, there, is, no, definitive, confirmation, for, this, it, is, unlikely, he, was, a, contemporary, of, plato, so, it, is, often, presumed, that, he, was, educated, by, plato, s, disciples, at, the, platonic, academy, in, athens, historian, thomas, heath, supported, this, theory, noting, that, most, capable, geometers, lived, in, athens, including, many, of, those, whose, work, euclid, built, on, historian, michalis, sialaros, considers, this, a, mere, conjecture, in, any, event, the, contents, of, euclid, s, work, demonstrate, familiarity, with, the, platonic, geometry, tradition, in, his, collection, pappus, mentions, that, apollonius, studied, with, euclid, s, students, in, alexandria, and, this, has, been, taken, to, imply, that, euclid, worked, and, founded, a, mathematical, tradition, there, the, city, was, founded, by, alexander, the, great, in, 331, bc, and, the, rule, of, ptolemy, i, from, 306, bc, onwards, gave, it, a, stability, which, was, relatively, unique, amid, the, chaotic, wars, over, dividing, alexander, s, empire, ptolemy, began, a, process, of, hellenization, and, commissioned, numerous, constructions, building, the, massive, musaeum, institution, which, was, a, leading, center, of, education, euclid, is, speculated, to, have, been, among, the, musaeum, s, first, scholars, euclid, s, date, of, death, is, unknown, it, has, been, speculated, that, he, died, c, 270, bc, euclid, is, often, referred, to, as, euclid, of, alexandria, to, differentiate, him, from, the, earlier, philosopher, euclid, of, megara, a, pupil, of, socrates, included, in, dialogues, of, plato, with, whom, he, was, historically, conflated, valerius, maximus, the, 1st, century, ad, roman, compiler, of, anecdotes, mistakenly, substituted, euclid, s, name, for, eudoxus, 4th, century, bc, as, the, mathematician, to, whom, plato, sent, those, asking, how, to, double, the, cube, perhaps, on, the, basis, of, this, mention, of, a, mathematical, euclid, roughly, a, century, early, euclid, became, mixed, up, with, euclid, of, megara, in, medieval, byzantine, sources, now, lost, eventually, leading, euclid, the, mathematician, to, be, ascribed, details, of, both, men, s, biographies, and, described, as, megarensis, lit, of, megara, the, byzantine, scholar, theodore, metochites, c, 1300, explicitly, conflated, the, two, euclids, as, did, printer, erhard, ratdolt, s, 1482, editio, princeps, of, campanus, of, novara, s, latin, translation, of, the, elements, after, the, mathematician, bartolomeo, zamberti, appended, most, of, the, extant, biographical, fragments, about, either, euclid, to, the, preface, of, his, 1505, translation, of, the, elements, subsequent, publications, passed, on, this, identification, later, renaissance, scholars, particularly, peter, ramus, reevaluated, this, claim, proving, it, false, via, issues, in, chronology, and, contradiction, in, early, sources, medieval, arabic, sources, give, vast, amounts, of, information, concerning, euclid, s, life, but, are, completely, unverifiable, most, scholars, consider, them, of, dubious, authenticity, heath, in, particular, contends, that, the, fictionalization, was, done, to, strengthen, the, connection, between, a, revered, mathematician, and, the, arab, world, there, are, also, numerous, anecdotal, stories, concerning, to, euclid, all, of, uncertain, historicity, which, picture, him, as, a, kindly, and, gentle, old, man, the, best, known, of, these, is, proclus, story, about, ptolemy, asking, euclid, if, there, was, a, quicker, path, to, learning, geometry, than, reading, his, elements, which, euclid, replied, with, there, is, no, royal, road, to, geometry, this, anecdote, is, questionable, since, a, very, similar, interaction, between, menaechmus, and, alexander, the, great, is, recorded, from, stobaeus, both, accounts, were, written, in, the, 5th, century, ad, neither, indicates, its, source, and, neither, appears, in, ancient, greek, literature, any, firm, dating, of, euclid, s, activity, c, 300, bc, is, called, into, question, by, a, lack, of, contemporary, references, the, earliest, original, reference, to, euclid, is, in, apollonius, prefatory, letter, to, the, conics, early, 2nd, century, bc, the, third, book, of, the, conics, contains, many, astonishing, theorems, that, are, useful, for, both, the, syntheses, and, the, determinations, of, number, of, solutions, of, solid, loci, most, of, these, and, the, finest, of, them, are, novel, and, when, we, discovered, them, we, realized, that, euclid, had, not, made, the, synthesis, of, the, locus, on, three, and, four, lines, but, only, an, accidental, fragment, of, it, and, even, that, was, not, felicitously, done, the, elements, is, speculated, to, have, been, at, least, partly, in, circulation, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, as, archimedes, and, apollonius, take, several, of, its, propositions, for, granted, however, archimedes, employs, an, older, variant, of, the, theory, of, proportions, than, the, one, found, in, the, elements, the, oldest, physical, copies, of, material, included, in, the, elements, dating, from, roughly, 100, ad, can, be, found, on, papyrus, fragments, unearthed, in, an, ancient, rubbish, heap, from, oxyrhynchus, roman, egypt, the, oldest, extant, direct, citations, to, the, elements, in, works, whose, dates, are, firmly, known, are, not, until, the, 2nd, century, ad, by, galen, and, alexander, of, aphrodisias, by, this, time, it, was, a, standard, school, text, some, ancient, greek, mathematicians, mention, euclid, by, name, but, he, is, usually, referred, to, as, the, author, of, elements, in, the, middle, ages, some, scholars, contended, euclid, was, not, a, historical, personage, and, that, his, name, arose, from, a, corruption, of, greek, mathematical, terms, euclid, is, best, known, for, his, thirteen, book, treatise, the, elements, greek, stoicheia, considered, his, magnum, opus, much, of, its, content, originates, from, earlier, mathematicians, including, eudoxus, hippocrates, of, chios, thales, and, theaetetus, while, other, theorems, are, mentioned, by, plato, and, aristotle, it, is, difficult, to, differentiate, the, work, of, euclid, from, that, of, his, predecessors, especially, because, the, elements, essentially, superseded, much, earlier, and, now, lost, greek, mathematics, the, classicist, markus, asper, concludes, that, apparently, euclid, s, achievement, consists, of, assembling, accepted, mathematical, knowledge, into, a, cogent, order, and, adding, new, proofs, to, fill, in, the, gaps, and, the, historian, serafina, cuomo, described, it, as, a, reservoir, of, results, despite, this, sialaros, furthers, that, the, remarkably, tight, structure, of, the, elements, reveals, authorial, control, beyond, the, limits, of, a, mere, editor, the, elements, does, not, exclusively, discuss, geometry, as, is, sometimes, believed, it, is, traditionally, divided, into, three, topics, plane, geometry, books, 1, 6, basic, number, theory, books, 7, 10, and, solid, geometry, books, 11, 13, though, book, 5, on, proportions, and, 10, on, irrational, lines, do, not, exactly, fit, this, scheme, the, heart, of, the, text, is, the, theorems, scattered, throughout, using, aristotle, s, terminology, these, may, be, generally, separated, into, two, categories, first, principles, and, second, principles, the, first, group, includes, statements, labeled, as, a, definition, greek, or, postulate, or, a, common, notion, only, the, first, book, includes, postulates, later, known, as, axioms, and, common, notions, the, second, group, consists, of, propositions, presented, alongside, mathematical, proofs, and, diagrams, it, is, unknown, if, euclid, intended, the, elements, as, a, textbook, but, its, method, of, presentation, makes, it, a, natural, fit, as, a, whole, the, authorial, voice, remains, general, and, impersonal, book, 1, of, the, elements, is, foundational, for, the, entire, text, it, begins, with, a, series, of, 20, definitions, for, basic, geometric, concepts, such, as, lines, angles, and, various, regular, polygons, euclid, then, presents, 10, assumptions, see, table, right, grouped, into, five, postulates, axioms, and, five, common, notions, these, assumptions, are, intended, to, provide, the, logical, basis, for, every, subsequent, theorem, i, e, serve, as, an, axiomatic, system, the, common, notions, exclusively, concern, the, comparison, of, magnitudes, while, postulates, 1, through, 4, are, relatively, straightforward, the, 5th, is, known, as, the, parallel, postulate, and, particularly, famous, book, 1, also, includes, 48, propositions, which, can, be, loosely, divided, into, those, concerning, basic, theorems, and, constructions, of, plane, geometry, and, triangle, congruence, 1, 26, parallel, lines, 27, 34, the, area, of, triangles, and, parallelograms, 35, 45, and, the, pythagorean, theorem, 46, 48, the, last, of, these, includes, the, earliest, surviving, proof, of, the, pythagorean, theorem, described, by, sialaros, as, remarkably, delicate, book, 2, is, traditionally, understood, as, concerning, geometric, algebra, though, this, interpretation, has, been, heavily, debated, since, the, 1970s, critics, describe, the, characterization, as, anachronistic, since, the, foundations, of, even, nascent, algebra, occurred, many, centuries, later, the, second, book, has, a, more, focused, scope, and, mostly, provides, algebraic, theorems, to, accompany, various, geometric, shapes, it, focuses, on, the, area, of, rectangles, and, squares, see, quadrature, and, leads, up, to, a, geometric, precursor, of, the, law, of, cosines, book, 3, focuses, on, circles, while, the, 4th, discusses, regular, polygons, especially, the, pentagon, book, 5, is, among, the, work, s, most, important, sections, and, presents, what, is, usually, termed, as, the, general, theory, of, proportion, book, 6, utilizes, the, theory, of, ratios, in, the, context, of, plane, geometry, it, is, built, almost, entirely, of, its, first, proposition, triangles, and, parallelograms, which, are, under, the, same, height, are, to, one, another, as, their, bases, from, book, 7, onwards, the, mathematician, benno, artmann, notes, that, euclid, starts, afresh, nothing, from, the, preceding, books, is, used, number, theory, is, covered, by, books, 7, to, 10, the, former, beginning, with, a, set, of, 22, definitions, for, parity, prime, numbers, and, other, arithmetic, related, concepts, book, 7, includes, the, euclidean, algorithm, a, method, for, finding, the, greatest, common, divisor, of, two, numbers, the, 8th, book, discusses, geometric, progressions, while, book, 9, includes, the, proposition, now, called, euclid, s, theorem, that, there, are, infinitely, many, prime, numbers, of, the, elements, book, 10, is, by, far, the, largest, and, most, complex, dealing, with, irrational, numbers, in, the, context, of, magnitudes, the, final, three, books, 11, 13, primarily, discuss, solid, geometry, by, introducing, a, list, of, 37, definitions, book, 11, contextualizes, the, next, two, although, its, foundational, character, resembles, book, 1, unlike, the, latter, it, features, no, axiomatic, system, or, postulates, the, three, sections, of, book, 11, include, content, on, solid, geometry, 1, 19, solid, angles, 20, 23, and, parallelepipedal, solids, 24, 37, in, addition, to, the, elements, at, least, five, works, of, euclid, have, survived, to, the, present, day, they, follow, the, same, logical, structure, as, elements, with, definitions, and, proved, propositions, four, other, works, are, credibly, attributed, to, euclid, but, have, been, lost, euclid, is, generally, considered, with, archimedes, and, apollonius, of, perga, as, among, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, antiquity, many, commentators, cite, him, as, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, the, history, of, mathematics, the, geometrical, system, established, by, the, elements, long, dominated, the, field, however, today, that, system, is, often, referred, to, as, euclidean, geometry, to, distinguish, it, from, other, non, euclidean, geometries, discovered, in, the, early, 19th, century, among, euclid, s, many, namesakes, are, the, european, space, agency, s, esa, euclid, spacecraft, the, lunar, crater, euclides, and, the, minor, planet, 4354, euclides, the, elements, is, often, considered, after, the, bible, as, the, most, frequently, translated, published, and, studied, book, in, the, western, world, s, history, with, aristotle, s, metaphysics, the, elements, is, perhaps, the, most, successful, ancient, greek, text, and, was, the, dominant, mathematical, textbook, in, the, medieval, arab, and, latin, worlds, the, first, english, edition, of, the, elements, was, published, in, 1570, by, henry, billingsley, and, john, dee, the, mathematician, oliver, byrne, published, a, well, known, version, of, the, elements, in, 1847, entitled, the, first, six, books, of, the, elements, of, euclid, in, which, coloured, diagrams, and, symbols, are, used, instead, of, letters, for, the, greater, ease, of, learners, which, included, colored, diagrams, intended, to, increase, its, pedagogical, effect, david, hilbert, authored, a, modern, axiomatization, of, the, elements
