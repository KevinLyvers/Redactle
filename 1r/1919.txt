it, became, evident, that, chand, was, at, his, best, he, took, the, ball, away, to, the, right, and, marthins, did, well, to, give, him, a, good, pass, quick, as, lightning, dhyan, chand, shot, a, goal, the, ball, struck, one, of, the, defenders, stick, and, went, into, the, net, giving, goalkeeper, collie, no, chance, a, goal, within, 3, minutes, of, the, start, was, more, than, what, the, most, optimistic, of, the, up, supporters, could, expect, at, the, interval, up, led, by, three, goals, to, nil, on, their, part, rajputana, put, every, ounce, of, their, efforts, to, score, the, up,

every, two, years, after, two, more, trial, matches, between, various, hopefuls, the, olympic, team, including, chand, as, center, forward, was, announced, and, assembled, in, bombay, center, half, broome, eric, pinniger, was, selected, as, the, vice, captain, the, ihf, was, initially, low, on, funds, since, the, provinces, of, bombay, madras, and, burma, had, turned, a, deaf, ear, to, their, financial, appeal, but, they, managed, to, scrape, enough, money, the, olympic, team, then, played, a, match, against, the, bombay, xi, and, amazingly, lost, 3, 2, even, though, singh, scored, both, his, team, s, goals, with, a, quiet, send, off, the, team, left, for, england, on, 10, march, to, play, 11, matches, against, local, sides, as, well, in, the, london, folkestone, festival, in, 1927,

conservative, body, but, there, seems, to, be, something, more, than, conservative, behind, their, unwillingness, apparently, ever, to, meet, india, in, a, full, international, encounter, finally, on, 24, april, the, team, arrived, in, amsterdam, to, embark, on, a, tour, of, the, low, countries, in, all, the, pre, olympic, matches, against, local, dutch, german, and, belgian, teams, the, indian,

the, match, would, be, which, was, heightened, by, the, feeling, that, the, burden, of, the, country, s, honour, was, on, their, shoulders, the, game, was, played, at, a, fast, pace, and, was, packed, with, thrilling, incidents, the, germans, undercut, and, lifted, the, ball, but, the, indian, team, countered, with, brilliant, half, volleying, and, amazing, long, shots, twice, dara, attempted, to,

olympic, final, in, his, autobiography, goal, chand, wrote, when, germany, was, four, goals, down, a, ball, hit, allen, s, pad, and, rebounded, the, germans, took, full, advantage, of, this, and, made, a, rush, netting, the, ball, before, we, could, stop, it, that, was, the, only, goal, germany, would, score, in, the, match, against, our, eight, and, incidentally, the, only, goal, scored, against, india, in, the, entire, olympic, tournament, india, s, goal, getters, were, roop, singh, tapsell, and, jaffar, with, one, each, dara, two, and, myself, three, the, international, hockey,
