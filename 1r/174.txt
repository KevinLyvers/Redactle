djoser, possible, architect, of, djoser, s, step, pyramid, and, high, priest, of, the, sun, god, ra, at, heliopolis, very, little, is, known, of, imhotep, as, a, historical, figure, but, in, the, 3, 000, years, following, his, death, he, was, gradually, glorified, and, deified, traditions, from, long, after, imhotep, s, death, treated, him, as, a, great, author, of, wisdom, texts, and, especially, as, a, physician, no, text, from, his, lifetime, mentions, these, capacities, and, no, text, mentions, his, name, in, the, first, 1, 200, years, following, his, death, apart, from, the, three, short, contemporary, inscriptions, that, establish, him, as, chancellor, to, the, pharaoh, the, first, text, to, reference, imhotep, dates, to, the, time, of, amenhotep, iii, c, 1391, 1353, bc, it, is, addressed, to, the, owner, of, a, tomb, and, reads, the, wab, priest, may, give, offerings, to, your, ka, the, wab, priests, may, stretch, to, you, their, arms, with, libations, on, the, soil, as, it, is, done, for, imhotep, with, the, remains, of, the, water, bowl, it, appears, that, this, libation, to, imhotep, was, done, regularly, as, they, are, attested, on, papyri, associated, with, statues, of, imhotep, until, the, late, period, c, 664, 332, bc, wildung, 1977, explains, the, origin, of, this, cult, as, a, slow, evolution, of, intellectuals, memory, of, imhotep, from, his, death, onward, gardiner, finds, the, cult, of, imhotep, during, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, 1077, bc, sufficiently, distinct, from, the, usual, offerings, made, to, other, commoners, that, the, epithet, demigod, is, likely, justified, to, describe, his, veneration, the, first, references, to, the, healing, abilities, of, imhotep, occur, from, the, thirtieth, dynasty, c, 380, 343, bc, onward, some, 2, 200, years, after, his, death, 127, 44, imhotep, is, among, under, a, dozen, non, royal, egyptians, who, were, deified, after, their, deaths, the, center, of, his, cult, was, in, memphis, the, location, of, his, tomb, remains, unknown, despite, efforts, to, find, it, the, consensus, is, that, it, is, hidden, somewhere, at, saqqara, imhotep, s, historicity, is, confirmed, by, two, contemporary, inscriptions, made, during, his, lifetime, on, the, base, or, pedestal, of, one, of, djoser, s, statues, cairo, je, 49889, and, also, by, a, graffito, on, the, enclosure, wall, surrounding, sekhemkhet, s, unfinished, step, pyramid, the, latter, inscription, suggests, that, imhotep, outlived, djoser, by, a, few, years, and, went, on, to, serve, in, the, construction, of, king, sekhemkhet, s, pyramid, which, was, abandoned, due, to, this, ruler, s, brief, reign, imhotep, was, one, of, the, chief, officials, of, the, pharaoh, djoser, concurring, with, much, later, legends, egyptologists, credit, him, with, the, design, and, construction, of, the, pyramid, of, djoser, a, step, pyramid, at, saqqara, built, during, the, 3rd, dynasty, he, may, also, have, been, responsible, for, the, first, known, use, of, stone, columns, to, support, a, building, despite, these, later, attestations, the, pharaonic, egyptians, themselves, never, credited, imhotep, as, the, designer, of, the, stepped, pyramid, nor, with, the, invention, of, stone, architecture, two, thousand, years, after, his, death, imhotep, s, status, had, risen, to, that, of, a, god, of, medicine, and, healing, eventually, imhotep, was, equated, with, thoth, the, god, of, architecture, mathematics, and, medicine, and, patron, of, scribes, imhotep, s, cult, was, merged, with, that, of, his, own, former, tutelary, god, he, was, revered, in, the, region, of, thebes, as, the, brother, of, amenhotep, son, of, hapu, another, deified, architect, in, the, temples, dedicated, to, thoth, v3, p104, because, of, his, association, with, health, the, greeks, equated, imhotep, with, asklepios, their, own, god, of, health, who, also, was, a, deified, mortal, according, to, myth, imhotep, s, mother, was, a, mortal, named, kheredu, ankh, she, too, being, eventually, revered, as, a, demi, goddess, as, the, daughter, of, banebdjedet, alternatively, since, imhotep, was, known, as, the, son, of, ptah, v, p106, his, mother, was, sometimes, claimed, to, be, sekhmet, the, patron, of, upper, egypt, whose, consort, was, ptah, the, upper, egyptian, famine, stela, which, dates, from, the, ptolemaic, period, 305, 30, bc, bears, an, inscription, containing, a, legend, about, a, famine, lasting, seven, years, during, the, reign, of, djoser, imhotep, is, credited, with, having, been, instrumental, in, ending, it, one, of, his, priests, explained, the, connection, between, the, god, khnum, and, the, rise, of, the, nile, to, the, pharaoh, who, then, had, a, dream, in, which, the, nile, god, spoke, to, him, promising, to, end, the, drought, a, demotic, papyrus, from, the, temple, of, tebtunis, dating, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, preserves, a, long, story, about, imhotep, the, pharaoh, djoser, plays, a, prominent, role, in, the, story, which, also, mentions, imhotep, s, family, his, father, the, god, ptah, his, mother, khereduankh, and, his, younger, sister, renpetneferet, at, one, point, djoser, desires, renpetneferet, and, imhotep, disguises, himself, and, tries, to, rescue, her, the, text, also, refers, to, the, royal, tomb, of, djoser, part, of, the, legend, includes, an, anachronistic, battle, between, the, old, kingdom, and, the, assyrian, armies, where, imhotep, fights, an, assyrian, sorceress, in, a, duel, of, magic, as, an, instigator, of, egyptian, culture, imhotep, s, idealized, image, lasted, well, into, the, roman, period, in, the, ptolemaic, period, the, egyptian, priest, and, historian, manetho, credited, him, with, inventing, the, method, of, a, stone, dressed, building, during, djoser, s, reign, although, he, was, not, the, first, to, actually, build, with, stone, stonewalling, flooring, lintels, and, jambs, had, appeared, sporadically, during, the, archaic, period, even, though, it, is, true, that, a, building, the, size, of, the, step, pyramid, made, entirely, out, of, stone, had, never, before, been, constructed, before, djoser, kings, were, buried, in, mastaba, tombs, egyptologist, james, peter, allen, states, that, the, greeks, equated, him, with, their, own, god, of, medicine, asklepios, although, ironically, there, is, no, evidence, that, imhotep, himself, was, a, physician, in, his, pulitzer, prize, winning, biography, of, cancer, the, emperor, of, all, maladies, siddhartha, mukherjee, cites, the, oldest, identified, written, diagnosis, of, cancer, to, imhotep, unfortunately, the, therapy, imhotep, laconically, prescribed, for, it, would, be, equally, recognizable, for, millennia, there, is, none, imhotep, s, name, is, shared, by, the, antagonist, of, the, 1932, film, the, mummy, its, 1999, remake, and, that, film, s, 2001, sequel
