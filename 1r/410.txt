possibility, of, psychic, phenomena, and, attended, about, 20, seances, experiments, in, telepathy, and, sittings, with, mediums, writing, to, spiritualist, journal, light, that, year, he, declared, himself, to, be, a, spiritualist, describing, one, particular, event, that, had, convinced, him, psychic, phenomena, were, real, also, in, 1887, on, 26, january, he, was, initiated, as, a, freemason, at, the, phoenix, lodge, no, 257, in, southsea, he, resigned, from, the, lodge, in, 1889, returned, to, it, in, 1902, and, resigned, again, in, 1911, in, 1889, he, became, a, founding, member, of, the, hampshire, society, for, psychical, research, in, 1893, he, joined, the, london, based, society, for, psychical, research, and, in, 1894, he, collaborated, with, sir, sidney, scott, and, frank, podmore, in, a, search, for, poltergeists, in, devon, doyle, was, also, a, member, of, the, hermetic, order, of, the, golden, dawn, doyle, and, the, spiritualist, william, thomas, stead, who, would, die, on, the, titanic, were, led, to, believe, that, julius, and, agnes, zancig, had, genuine, psychic, powers, and, they, claimed, publicly, that, the, zancigs, used, telepathy, however, in, 1924, the, zancigs, confessed, that, their, mind, reading, act, had, been, a, trick, they, published, the, secret, code, and, all, other, details, of, the, trick, method, they, had, used, under, the, title, our, secrets, in, a, london, newspaper, doyle, also, praised, the, psychic, phenomena, and, spirit, materialisations, that, he, believed, had, been, produced, by, eusapia, palladino, and, mina, crandon, both, of, whom, were, also, later, exposed, as, frauds, in, 1916, at, the, height, of, the, first, world, war, doyle, s, belief, in, psychic, phenomena, was, strengthened, by, what, he, took, to, be, the, psychic, abilities, of, his, children, s, nanny, lily, loder, symonds, this, and, the, constant, drumbeat, of, wartime, deaths, inspired, him, with, the, idea, that, spiritualism, was, what, he, called, a, new, revelation, sent, by, god, to, bring, solace, to, the, bereaved, he, wrote, a, piece, in, light, magazine, about, his, faith, and, began, lecturing, frequently, on, spiritualism, in, 1918, he, published, his, first, spiritualist, work, the, new, revelation, some, have, mistakenly, assumed, that, doyle, s, turn, to, spiritualism, was, prompted, by, the, death, of, his, son, kingsley, but, doyle, began, presenting, himself, publicly, as, a, spiritualist, in, 1916, and, kingsley, died, on, 28, october, 1918, from, pneumonia, contracted, during, his, convalescence, after, being, seriously, wounded, in, the, 1916, battle, of, the, somme, nevertheless, the, war, related, deaths, of, many, people, who, were, close, to, him, appear, to, have, even, further, strengthened, his, long, held, belief, in, life, after, death, and, spirit, communication, doyle, s, brother, brigadier, general, innes, doyle, died, also, from, pneumonia, in, february, 1919, his, two, brothers, in, law, one, of, whom, was, e, w, hornung, creator, of, the, literary, character, raffles, as, well, as, his, two, nephews, also, died, shortly, after, the, war, his, second, book, on, spiritualism, the, vital, message, appeared, in, 1919, doyle, found, solace, in, supporting, spiritualism, s, ideas, and, the, attempts, of, spiritualists, to, find, proof, of, an, existence, beyond, the, grave, in, particular, according, to, some, he, favoured, christian, spiritualism, and, encouraged, the, spiritualists, national, union, to, accept, an, eighth, precept, that, of, following, the, teachings, and, example, of, jesus, of, nazareth, he, was, a, member, of, the, renowned, supernaturalist, organisation, the, ghost, club, in, 1919, the, magician, p, t, selbit, staged, a, s, ance, at, his, flat, in, bloomsbury, which, doyle, attended, although, some, later, claimed, that, doyle, had, endorsed, the, apparent, instances, of, clairvoyance, at, that, s, ance, as, genuine, a, contemporaneous, report, by, the, sunday, express, quoted, doyle, as, saying, i, should, have, to, see, it, again, before, passing, a, definite, opinion, on, it, and, i, have, my, doubts, about, the, whole, thing, in, 1920, doyle, and, the, noted, sceptic, joseph, mccabe, held, a, public, debate, at, queen, s, hall, in, london, with, doyle, taking, the, position, that, the, claims, of, spiritualism, were, true, after, the, debate, mccabe, published, a, booklet, is, spiritualism, based, on, fraud, in, which, he, laid, out, evidence, refuting, doyle, s, arguments, and, claimed, that, doyle, had, been, duped, into, believing, in, spiritualism, through, deliberate, mediumship, trickery, doyle, also, debated, the, psychiatrist, harold, dearden, who, vehemently, disagreed, with, doyle, s, belief, that, many, cases, of, diagnosed, mental, illness, were, the, result, of, spirit, possession, in, 1920, doyle, travelled, to, australia, and, new, zealand, on, spiritualist, missionary, work, and, over, the, next, several, years, until, his, death, he, continued, his, mission, giving, talks, about, his, spiritualist, conviction, in, britain, europe, and, the, united, states, doyle, wrote, a, novel, the, land, of, mist, centred, on, spiritualist, themes, and, featuring, the, character, professor, challenger, he, also, wrote, many, non, fiction, spiritualist, works, perhaps, his, most, famous, of, these, was, the, coming, of, the, fairies, 1922, in, which, doyle, described, his, beliefs, about, the, nature, and, existence, of, fairies, and, spirits, reproduced, the, five, cottingley, fairies, photographs, asserted, that, those, who, suspected, them, being, faked, were, wrong, and, expressed, his, conviction, that, they, were, authentic, decades, later, the, photos, taken, by, cousins, frances, griffiths, and, elsie, wright, were, definitively, shown, to, have, been, faked, and, their, creators, admitted, to, the, fakery, although, both, maintained, that, they, really, had, seen, fairies, doyle, was, friends, for, a, time, with, the, american, magician, harry, houdini, even, though, houdini, explained, that, his, feats, were, based, on, illusion, and, trickery, doyle, was, convinced, that, houdini, had, supernatural, powers, and, said, as, much, in, his, work, the, edge, of, the, unknown, houdini, s, friend, bernard, m, l, ernst, recounted, a, time, when, houdini, had, performed, an, impressive, trick, at, his, home, in, doyle, s, presence, houdini, had, assured, doyle, that, the, trick, was, pure, illusion, and, had, expressed, the, hope, that, this, demonstration, would, persuade, doyle, not, to, go, around, endorsing, phenomena, simply, because, he, could, think, of, no, explanation, for, what, he, had, seen, other, than, supernatural, power, however, according, to, ernst, doyle, simply, refused, to, believe, that, it, had, been, a, trick, houdini, became, a, prominent, opponent, of, the, spiritualist, movement, in, the, 1920s, after, the, death, of, his, beloved, mother, he, insisted, that, spiritualist, mediums, employed, trickery, and, consistently, exposed, them, as, frauds, these, differences, between, houdini, and, doyle, eventually, led, to, a, bitter, public, falling, out, between, them, in, 1922, the, psychical, researcher, harry, price, accused, the, spirit, photographer, william, hope, of, fraud, doyle, defended, hope, but, further, evidence, of, trickery, was, obtained, from, other, researchers, doyle, threatened, to, have, price, evicted, from, the, national, laboratory, of, psychical, research, and, predicted, that, if, he, persisted, in, writing, what, he, called, sewage, about, spiritualists, he, would, meet, the, same, fate, as, harry, houdini, price, wrote, arthur, conan, doyle, and, his, friends, abused, me, for, years, for, exposing, hope, in, response, to, the, exposure, of, frauds, that, had, been, perpetrated, by, hope, and, other, spiritualists, doyle, led, 84, members, of, the, society, for, psychical, research, to, resign, in, protest, from, the, society, on, the, ground, that, they, believed, it, was, opposed, to, spiritualism, doyle, s, two, volume, book, the, history, of, spiritualism, was, published, in, 1926, w, leslie, curnow, a, spiritualist, contributed, much, research, to, the, book, later, that, year, robert, john, tillyard, wrote, a, predominantly, supportive, review, of, it, in, the, journal, nature, this, review, provoked, controversy, several, other, critics, including, a, a, campbell, swinton, pointed, out, the, evidence, of, fraud, in, mediumship, as, well, as, doyle, s, non, scientific, approach, to, the, subject, in, 1927, doyle, gave, a, filmed, interview, in, which, he, spoke, about, sherlock, holmes, and, spiritualism, richard, milner, an, american, historian, of, science, argued, that, doyle, may, have, been, the, perpetrator, of, the, piltdown, man, hoax, of, 1912, creating, the, counterfeit, hominid, fossil, that, fooled, the, scientific, world, for, over, 40, years, milner, noted, that, doyle, had, a, plausible, motive, namely, revenge, on, the, scientific, establishment, for, debunking, one, of, his, favourite, psychics, and, said, that, the, lost, world, appeared, to, contain, several, clues, referring, cryptically, to, his, having, been, involved, in, the, hoax, samuel, rosenberg, s, 1974, book, naked, is, the, best, disguise, purports, to, explain, how, throughout, his, writings, doyle, had, provided, overt, clues, to, otherwise, hidden, or, suppressed, aspects, of, his, way, of, thinking, that, seemed, to, support, the, idea, that, doyle, would, be, involved, in, such, a, hoax, however, more, recent, research, suggests, that, doyle, was, not, involved, in, 2016, researchers, at, the, natural, history, museum, and, liverpool, john, moores, university, analyzed, dna, evidence, showing, that, responsibility, for, the, hoax, lay, with, the, amateur, archaeologist, charles, dawson, who, had, originally, found, the, remains, he, had, initially, not, been, considered, the, likely, perpetrator, because, the, hoax, was, seen, as, being, too, elaborate, for, him, to, have, devised, however, the, dna, evidence, showed, that, a, supposedly, ancient, tooth, he, had, discovered, in, 1915, at, a, different, site, came, from, the, same, jaw, as, that, of, the, piltdown, man, suggesting, that, he, had, planted, them, both, that, tooth, too, was, later, proven, to, have, been, planted, as, part, of, a, hoax, chris, stringer, an, anthropologist, from, the, natural, history, museum, was, quoted, as, saying, conan, doyle, was, known, to, play, golf, at, the, piltdown, site, and, had, even, given, dawson, a, lift, in, his, car, to, the, area, but, he, was, a, public, man, and, very, busy, and, it, is, very, unlikely, that, he, would, have, had, the, time, so, there, are, some, coincidences, but, i, think, they, are, just, coincidences, when, you, look, at, the, fossil, evidence, you, can, only, associate, dawson, with, all, the, finds, and, dawson, was, known, to, be, personally, ambitious, he, wanted, professional, recognition, he, wanted, to, be, a, member, of, the, royal, society, and, he, was, after, an, mbe, he, wanted, people, to, stop, seeing, him, as, an, amateur, another, of, doyle, s, longstanding, interests, was, architectural, design, in, 1895, when, he, commissioned, an, architect, friend, of, his, joseph, henry, ball, to, build, him, a, home, he, played, an, active, part, in, the, design, process, the, home, in, which, he, lived, from, october, 1897, to, september, 1907, known, as, undershaw, near, hindhead, in, surrey, was, used, as, a, hotel, and, restaurant, from, 1924, until, 2004, when, it, was, bought, by, a, developer, and, then, stood, empty, while, conservationists, and, doyle, fans, fought, to, preserve, it, in, 2012, the, high, court, in, london, ruled, in, favor, of, those, seeking, to, preserve, the, historic, building, ordering, that, the, redevelopment, permission, be, quashed, on, the, ground, that, it, had, not, been, obtained, through, proper, procedures, the, building, was, later, approved, to, become, part, of, stepping, stones, a, school, for, children, with, disabilities, and, special, needs, doyle, made, his, most, ambitious, foray, into, architecture, in, march, 1912, while, he, was, staying, at, the, lyndhurst, grand, hotel, he, sketched, the, original, designs, for, a, third, storey, extension, and, for, an, alteration, of, the, front, facade, of, the, building, work, began, later, that, year, and, when, it, was, finished, the, building, was, a, nearly, exact, manifestation, of, the, plans, doyle, had, sketched, superficial, alterations, have, been, subsequently, made, but, the, essential, structure, is, still, clearly, doyle, s, in, 1914, on, a, family, trip, to, the, jasper, national, park, in, canada, he, designed, a, golf, course, and, ancillary, buildings, for, a, hotel, the, plans, were, realised, in, full, but, neither, the, golf, course, nor, the, buildings, have, survived, in, 1926, doyle, laid, the, foundation, stone, for, a, spiritualist, temple, in, camden, london, of, the, building, s, total, 600, construction, costs, he, provided, 500, the, crimes, club, was, a, private, social, club, founded, by, doyle, in,
