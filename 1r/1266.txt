into, the, royal, houses, of, europe, something, which, his, immediate, predecessors, had, consciously, tended, to, avoid, peter, s, son, aleksei, petrovich, born, of, his, first, marriage, to, a, russian, noblewoman, had, no, problem, securing, a, bride, from, the, ancient, house, of, brunswick, l, neburg, however, the, tsar, experienced, difficulties, in, arranging, similar, marriages, for,

who, was, then, living, in, exile, in, russia, as, peter, s, guest, after, having, failed, in, his, attempt, to, succeed, his, maternal, uncle, as, king, of, sweden, and, whose, patrimony, was, at, that, time, under, danish, occupation, despite, all, this, the, prince, was, of, impeccable, birth, and, well, connected, to, many, royal, houses, it, was, a, respectable, and, politically, useful, alliance, in, the, same, year, elizabeth, was, betrothed, to, marry, charles, frederick, s, first, cousin, charles, augustus, of, holstein, gottorp, the, eldest, son, of, christian, augustus, prince, of, eutin, anna, petrovna, s, wedding, took, place, in, 1725, as, planned, even, though, her, father, had, died, 8, february, 1725, a, few, weeks, before, the, nuptials, in, elizabeth, s, case, however, her, fianc, died, on, 31, may, 1727, before, her, wedding, could, be, celebrated, this, came, as, a, double, blow, to, elizabeth, because, her, mother, who, had, ascended, to, the, throne, as, catherine, i, had, died, just, two, weeks, previously, on, 17, may, 1727, by, the, end, of, may, 1727, 17, year, old, elizabeth, had, lost, her, fianc, and, both, of, her, parents, furthermore, her, half, nephew, peter, ii, had, ascended, the, throne, her, marriage, prospects, continued, to, fail, to, improve, three, years, later, when, her, nephew, died, and, was, succeeded, on, the, throne, by, elizabeth, s, first, cousin, anna, daughter, of, ivan, v, there, was, little, love, lost, between, the, cousins, and, no, prospect, of, either, any, russian, nobleman, or, any, foreign, prince, seeking, elizabeth, s, hand, in, marriage, nor, could, she, marry, a, commoner, because, it, would, cost, her, royal, status, property, rights, and, claim, to, the, throne, the, fact, that, elizabeth, was, something, of, a, beauty, did, not, improve, marriage, prospects, but, instead, earned, her, resentment, when, the, empress, anna, asked, the, chinese, minister, in, saint, petersburg, to, identify, the, most, beautiful, woman, at, her, court, he, pointed, to, elizabeth, much, to, anna, s, displeasure, elizabeth, s, response, to, the, lack, of, marriage, prospects, was, to, take, alexander, shubin, a, sergeant, in, the, semyonovsky, life, guards, regiment, as, her, lover, when, empress, anna, found, out, about, this, she, banished, him, to, siberia, after, consoling, herself, elizabeth, turned, to, coachmen, and, footmen, for, her, sexual, pleasure, she, eventually, found, a, long, term, companion, in, alexei, razumovsky, a, kind, hearted, ukrainian, cossack, with, a, good, bass, voice, razumovsky, had, been, brought, from, his, village, to, saint, petersburg, by, a, nobleman, to, sing, for, a, church, choir, but, the, grand, duchess, purchased, the, talented, serf, from, the, nobleman, for, her, own, choir, a, simple, minded, man, razumovsky, never, showed, interest, in, affairs, of, state, during, all, the, years, of, his, relationship, with, elizabeth, which, spanned, from, the, days, of, her, obscurity, to, the, height, of, her, power, as, the, couple, was, devoted, to, each, other, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, they, might, even, have, married, in, a, secret, ceremony, in, 1742, the, holy, roman, emperor, made, razumovsky, a, count, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1756, elizabeth, made, him, a, prince, and, field, marshal, while, aleksandr, danilovich, menshikov, remained, in, power, until, september, 1727, the, government, of, elizabeth, s, adolescent, nephew, peter, ii, reigned, 1727, 1730, treated, her, with, liberality, and, distinction, however, the, dolgorukovs, an, ancient, boyar, family, deeply, resented, menshikov, with, peter, ii, s, attachment, to, prince, ivan, dolgorukov, and, two, of, their, family, members, on, the, supreme, state, council, they, had, the, leverage, for, a, successful, coup, menshikov, was, arrested, stripped, of, all, his, honours, and, properties, and, exiled, to, northern, siberia, where, he, died, in, november, 1729, the, dolgorukovs, hated, the, memory, of, peter, the, great, and, practically, banished, his, daughter, from, court, during, the, reign, of, her, cousin, anna, 1730, 1740, elizabeth, was, gathering, support, in, the, background, being, the, daughter, of, peter, the, great, she, enjoyed, much, support, from, the, russian, guards, regiments, she, often, visited, the, elite, guards, regiments, marking, special, events, with, the, officers, and, acting, as, godmother, to, their, children, after, the, death, of, empress, anna, the, regency, of, anna, leopoldovna, for, the, infant, ivan, vi, was, marked, by, high, taxes, and, economic, problems, the, french, ambassador, in, saint, petersburg, the, marquis, de, la, ch, tardie, was, deeply, involved, in, planning, a, coup, to, depose, the, regent, whose, foreign, policy, was, opposed, to, the, interests, of, france, and, bribed, numerous, officers, in, the, imperial, guard, to, support, elizabeth, s, coup, the, french, adventurer, jean, armand, de, lestocq, helped, her, actions, according, to, the, advice, of, the, marquis, de, la, ch, tardie, and, the, swedish, ambassador, who, were, particularly, interested, in, toppling, the, regime, of, anna, leopoldovna, on, the, night, of, 25, november, 1741, o, s, elizabeth, seized, power, with, the, help, of, the, preobrazhensky, life, guards, regiment, arriving, at, the, regimental, headquarters, wearing, a, warrior, s, metal, breastplate, over, her, dress, and, grasping, a, silver, cross, she, challenged, them, whom, do, you, want, to, serve, me, your, natural, sovereign, or, those, who, have, stolen, my, inheritance, won, over, the, regiment, marched, to, the, winter, palace, and, arrested, the, infant, emperor, his, parents, and, their, own, lieutenant, colonel, count, burkhard, christoph, von, munnich, it, was, a, daring, coup, and, amazingly, succeeded, without, bloodshed, elizabeth, had, vowed, that, if, she, became, empress, she, would, not, sign, a, single, death, sentence, an, extraordinary, promise, at, the, time, but, one, that, she, kept, throughout, her, life, despite, elizabeth, s, promise, there, was, still, cruelty, in, her, regime, although, she, initially, thought, of, allowing, the, young, tsar, and, his, mother, to, leave, russia, she, imprisoned, them, later, in, a, shlisselburg, fortress, worried, that, they, would, stir, up, trouble, for, her, in, other, parts, of, europe, fearing, a, coup, on, ivan, s, favour, elizabeth, set, about, destroying, all, papers, coins, or, anything, else, depicting, or, mentioning, ivan, she, had, issued, an, order, that, if, any, attempt, were, made, for, the, adult, ivan, to, escape, he, was, to, be, eliminated, catherine, the, great, upheld, the, order, and, when, an, attempt, was, made, he, was, killed, and, secretly, buried, within, the, fortress, another, case, was, countess, natalia, lopukhina, the, circumstances, of, elizabeth, s, birth, would, later, be, used, by, her, political, opponents, to, challenge, her, right, to, the, throne, on, grounds, of, illegitimacy, when, countess, lopukhina, s, son, ivan, lopukhin, complained, of, elizabeth, in, a, tavern, he, implicated, his, mother, himself, and, others, in, a, plot, to, reinstate, ivan, vi, as, tsar, ivan, lopukhin, was, overheard, and, tortured, for, information, all, the, conspirators, were, sentenced, to, death, the, female, conspirators, had, their, sentences, commuted, to, having, their, tongues, removed, and, being, publicly, flogged, the, men, were, broken, on, the, wheel, elizabeth, crowned, herself, empress, in, the, dormition, cathedral, on, 25, april, 1742, o, s, which, would, become, standard, for, all, emperors, of, russia, until, 1896, at, the, age, of, thirty, three, with, relatively, little, political, experience, she, found, herself, at, the, head, of, a, great, empire, at, one, of, the, most, critical, periods, of, its, existence, her, proclamation, explained, that, the, preceding, reigns, had, led, russia, to, ruin, the, russian, people, have, been, groaning, under, the, enemies, of, the, christian, faith, but, she, has, delivered, them, from, the, degrading, foreign, oppression, russia, had, been, under, the, domination, of, german, advisers, so, elizabeth, exiled, the, most, unpopular, of, them, including, andrey, osterman, and, burkhard, christoph, von, m, nnich, she, passed, down, several, pieces, of, legislation, that, undid, much, of, the, work, her, father, had, done, to, limit, the, power, of, the, church, with, all, her, shortcomings, documents, often, waited, months, for, her, signature, elizabeth, had, inherited, her, father, s, genius, for, government, her, usually, keen, judgement, and, her, diplomatic, tact, again, and, again, recalled, peter, the, great, what, sometimes, appeared, as, irresolution, and, procrastination, was, most, often, a, wise, suspension, of, judgement, under, exceptionally, difficult, circumstances, from, the, russian, point, of, view, her, greatness, as, a, stateswoman, consisted, of, her, steady, appreciation, of, national, interests, and, her, determination, to, promote, them, against, all, obstacles, despite, the, substantial, changes, made, by, peter, the, great, he, had, not, exercised, a, really, formative, influence, on, the, intellectual, attitudes, of, the, ruling, classes, as, a, whole, although, elizabeth, lacked, the, early, education, necessary, to, flourish, as, an, intellectual, once, finding, the, reading, of, secular, literature, to, be, injurious, to, health, she, was, clever, enough, to, know, its, benefits, and, made, considerable, groundwork, for, her, eventual, successor, catherine, the, great, she, made, education, freely, available, to, all, social, classes, except, for, serfs, encouraged, establishment, of, the, first, university, in, russia, founded, in, moscow, by, mikhail, lomonosov, and, helped, to, finance, the, establishment, of, the, imperial, academy, of, fine, arts, a, gifted, diplomat, elizabeth, hated, bloodshed, and, conflict, and, went, to, great, lengths, to, alter, the, russian, system, of, punishment, even, outlawing, capital, punishment, according, to, historian, robert, nisbet, bain, it, was, one, of, her, chief, glories, that, so, far, as, she, was, able, she, put, a, stop, to, that, mischievous, contention, of, rival, ambitions, at, court, which, had, disgraced, the, reigns, of, peter, ii, anna, and, ivan, vi, and, enabled, foreign, powers, to, freely, interfere, in, the, domestic, affairs, of, russia, elizabeth, enjoyed, and, excelled, in, architecture, overseeing, and, financing, many, construction, projects, during, her, reign, one, of, the, many, projects, from, the, italian, architect, bartolomeo, rastrelli, was, the, reconstruction, of, peterhof, palace, adding, several, wings, between, 1745, and, 1755, her, most, famous, creations, were, the, smolny, convent, and, the, winter, palace, though, she, died, before, its, completion, the, palace, is, said, to, contain, 1, 500, rooms, 1, 786, doors, and, 1, 945, windows, including, bureaucratic, offices, and, the, imperial, family, s, living, quarters, arranged, in, two, enfilades, from, the, top, of, the, jordan, staircase, regarding, the, smolny, convent, historian, robert, nisbet, bain, stated, that, no, other, russian, sovereign, ever, erected, so, many, churches, the, expedited, completion, of, buildings, became, a, matter, of, importance, to, the, empress, and, work, continued, throughout, the, year, even, in, winter, s, severest, months, 859, 555, rubles, had, been, allocated, to, the, project, a, sum, raised, by, a, tax, on, state, owned, taverns, but, work, temporarily, ceased, due, to, lack, of, resources, ultimately, taxes, were, increased, on, salt, and, alcohol, to, completely, fund, the, extra, costs, however, elizabeth, s, incredible, extravagance, ended, up, greatly, benefiting, the, country, s, infrastructure, needing, goods, shipped, from, all, over, the, world, numerous, roads, in, all, russia, were, modernised, at, her, orders, as, an, unmarried, and, childless, empress, it, was, imperative, for, elizabeth, to, find, a, legitimate, heir, to, secure, the, romanov, dynasty, she, chose, her, nephew, peter, of, holstein, gottorp, the, young, peter, had, lost, his, mother, shortly, after, he, was, born, and, his, father, at, the, age, of, eleven, elizabeth, invited, her, young, nephew, to, saint, petersburg, where, he, was, received, into, the, russian, orthodox, church, and, proclaimed, the, heir, to, the, throne, on, 7, november, 1742, keen, to, see, the, dynasty, secured, elizabeth, immediately, gave, peter, the, best, russian, tutors, and, settled, on, princess, sophie, of, anhalt, zerbst, as, a, bride, for, her, heir, incidentally, sophie, s, mother, joanna, elisabeth, of, holstein, gottorp, was, a, sister, of, elizabeth, s, own, fianc, who, had, died, before, the, wedding, on, her, conversion, to, the, russian, orthodox, church, sophie, was, given, the, name, catherine, in, memory, of, elizabeth, s, mother, the, marriage, took, place, on, 21, august, 1745, nine, years, later, a, son, the, future, paul, i, was, born, on, 20, september, 1754, there, is, considerable, speculation, as, to, the, actual, paternity, of, paul, it, is, suggested, that, he, was, not, peter, s, son, at, all, but, that, his, mother, had, engaged, in, an, affair, to, which, elizabeth, had, consented, with, a, young, officer, sergei, vasilievich, saltykov, who, would, have, been, paul, s, biological, father, peter, never, gave, any, indication, that, he, believed, paul, to, have, been, fathered, by, anyone, but, himself, but, took, no, interest, in, parenthood, elizabeth, most, certainly, took, an, active, interest, and, acted, as, if, she, were, his, mother, instead, of, catherine, shortly, after, paul, s, birth, the, empress, ordered, the, midwife, to, take, the, baby, and, to, follow, her, and, catherine, did, not, see, her, child, for, another, month, for, a, short, churching, ceremony, six, months, later, elizabeth, let, catherine, see, the, child, again, the, child, had, in, effect, become, a, ward, of, the, state, and, in, a, larger, sense, the, property, of, the, state, elizabeth, abolished, the, cabinet, council, system, that, had, been, used, under, anna, and, reconstituted, the, senate, as, it, had, been, under, peter, the, great, with, the, chiefs, of, the, departments, of, state, none, of, them, german, attending, her, first, task, after, this, was, to, address, the, war, with, sweden, on, 23, january, 1743, direct, negotiations, between, the, two, powers, were, opened, at, bo, in, the, treaty, of, bo, on, 7, august, 1743, o, s, sweden, ceded, to, russia, all, of, southern, finland, east, of, the, kymmene, river, which, became, the, boundary, between, the, two, states, the, treaty, also, gave, russia, the, fortresses, of, villmanstrand, and, fredrikshamn, the, concessions, to, russia, can, be, credited, to, the, diplomatic, ability, of, the, new, vice, chancellor, aleksey, bestuzhev, ryumin, who, had, elizabeth, s, support, she, placed, bestuzhev, at, the, head, of, foreign, affairs, immediately, after, her, accession, he, represented, the, anti, franco, prussian, side, of, her, council, and, his, objective, was, an, alliance, with, england, and, austria, at, that, time, it, was, probably, advantageous, to, russia, both, the, lopukhina, affair, and, other, attempts, of, frederick, the, great, and, louis, xv, to, get, rid, of, bestuzhev, failed, instead, they, put, the, russian, court, into, the, centre, of, a, tangle, of, intrigue, during, the, earlier, years, of, elizabeth, s, reign, ultimately, the, minister, s, strong, support, from, the, empress, prevailed, bestuzhev, had, many, achievements, his, effective, diplomacy, and, 30, 000, troops, sent, to, the, rhine, accelerated, the, peace, negotiations, leading, to, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, 18, october, 1748, he, extricated, his, country, from, the, swedish, imbroglio, and, reconciled, his, imperial, mistress, with, the, courts, of, vienna, and, london, he, enabled, russia, to, assert, herself, effectually, in, poland, the, ottoman, empire, sweden, and, isolated, the, king, of, prussia, by, forcing, him, into, hostile, alliances, all, this, would, have, been, impossible, without, the, steady, support, of, elizabeth, who, trusted, him, completely, in, spite, of, the, chancellor, s, many, enemies, most, of, whom, were, her, personal, friends, however, on, 14, february, 1758, bestuzhev, was, removed, from, office, the, future, catherine, ii, recorded, he, was, relieved, of, all, his, decorations, and, rank, without, a, soul, being, able, to, reveal, for, what, crimes, or, transgressions, the, first, gentleman, of, the, empire, was, so, despoiled, and, sent, back, to, his, house, as, a, prisoner, no, specific, crime, was, ever, pinned, on, bestuzhev, instead, it, was, inferred, that, he, had, attempted, to, sow, discord, between, the, empress, and, her, heir, and, his, consort, enemies, of, the, pro, austrian, bestuzhev, were, his, rivals, the, shuvalov, family, vice, chancellor, mikhail, vorontsov, and, the, french, ambassador, the, great, event, of, elizabeth, s, later, years, was, the, seven, years, war, elizabeth, regarded, the, convention, of, westminster, 16, january, 1756, in, which, great, britain, and, prussia, agreed, to, unite, their, forces, to, oppose, the, entry, of, or, the, passage, through, germany, of, troops, of, every, foreign, power, as, utterly, subversive, of, the, previous, conventions, between, great, britain, and, russia, elizabeth, sided, against, prussia, over, a, personal, dislike, of, frederick, the, great, she, wanted, him, reduced, within, proper, limits, so, that, he, might, no, longer, be, an, alleged, danger, to, the, empire, elizabeth, acceded, to, the, second, treaty, of, versailles, thus, entering, into, an, alliance, with, france, and, austria, against, prussia, on, 17, may, 1757, the, imperial, russian, army, 85, 000, strong, advanced, against, k, nigsberg, the, serious, illness, of, the, empress, which, began, with, a, fainting, fit, at, tsarskoe, selo, 19, september, 1757, the, fall, of, bestuzhev, 21, february, 1758, and, the, cabals, and, intrigues, of, the, various, foreign, powers, at, saint, petersburg, did, not, interfere, with, the, progress, of, the, war, the, crushing, defeat, of, kunersdorf, 12, august, 1759, at, last, brought, frederick, to, the, verge, of, ruin, from, that, day, he, despaired, of, success, but, he, was, saved, for, the, moment, by, the, jealousies, of, the, russian, and, austrian, commanders, which, ruined, the, military, plans, of, the, allies, from, the, end, of, 1759, to, the, end, of, 1761, the, eagerness, of, the, russian, empress, was, the, one, constraining, political, force, that, held, together, the, heterogeneous, incessantly, jarring, elements, of, the, anti, prussian, combination, from, the, russian, point, of, view, her, greatness, as, a, stateswoman, consisted, of, her, steady, appreciation, of, russian, interests, and, her, determination, to, promote, them, against, all, obstacles, she, insisted, throughout, that, the, king, of, prussia, must, be, reduced, to, the, rank, of, a, prince, elector, frederick, himself, was, quite, aware, of, his, danger, i, m, at, the, end, of, my, resources, he, wrote, at, the, beginning, of, 1760, the, continuance, of, this, war, means, for, me, utter, ruin, things, may, drag, on, perhaps, till, july, but, then, a, catastrophe, must, come, on, 21, may, 1760, a, fresh, convention, was, signed, between, russia, and, austria, a, secret, clause, of, which, never, communicated, to, the, court, of, versailles, guaranteed, east, prussia, to, russia, as, an, indemnity, for, war, expenses, the, failure, of, the, campaign, of, 1760, wielded, by, the, inept, count, buturlin, induced, the, court, of, versailles, on, the, evening, of, 22, january, 1761, to, present, to, the, court, of, saint, petersburg, a, dispatch, to, the, effect, that, the, king, of, france, by, reason, of, the, condition, of, his, dominions, absolutely, desired, peace, the, russian, empress, s, reply, was, delivered, to, the, two, ambassadors, on, 12, february, it, was, inspired, by, the, most, uncompromising, hostility, towards, the, king, of, prussia, elizabeth, would, not, consent, to, any, pacific, overtures, until, the, original, object, of, the, league, had, been, accomplished, simultaneously, elizabeth, had, conveyed, to, louis, xv, a, confidential, letter, in, which, she, proposed, the, signature, of, a, new, treaty, of, alliance, of, a, more, comprehensive, and, explicit, nature, than, the, preceding, treaties, between, the, two, powers, without, the, knowledge, of, austria, elizabeth, s, object, in, the, mysterious, negotiation, seems, to, have, been, to, reconcile, france, and, great, britain, in, return, for, which, signal, service, france, was, to, throw, all, her, forces, into, the, attack, on, prussia, this, project, which, lacked, neither, ability, nor, audacity, foundered, upon, louis, xv, s, invincible, jealousy, of, the, growth, of, russian, influence, in, eastern, europe, and, his, fear, of, offending, the, porte, it, was, finally, arranged, by, the, allies, that, their, envoys, at, paris, should, fix, the, date, for, the, assembling, of, a, peace, congress, and, that, in, the, meantime, the, war, against, prussia, should, be, vigorously, prosecuted, in, 1760, a, russian, flying, column, briefly, occupied, berlin, russian, victories, placed, prussia, in, serious, danger, the, campaign, of, 1761, was, almost, as, abortive, as, the, campaign, of, 1760, frederick, acted, on, the, defensive, with, consummate, skill, and, the, capture, of, the, prussian, fortress, of, kolberg, on, christmas, day, 1761, by, rumyantsev, was, the, sole, russian, success, frederick, however, was, now, at, the, last, gasp, on, 6, january, 1762, he, wrote, to, count, karl, wilhelm, finck, von, finckenstein, we, ought, now, to, think, of, preserving, for, my, nephew, by, way, of, negotiation, whatever, fragments, of, my, territory, we, can, save, from, the, avidity, of, my, enemies, a, fortnight, later, he, wrote, to, prince, ferdinand, of, brunswick, the, sky, begins, to, clear, courage, my, dear, fellow, i, have, received, the, news, of, a, great, event, the, miracle, of, the, house, of, brandenburg, that, snatched, him, from, destruction, was, the, death, of, the, russian, empress, on, 5, january, 1762, n, s, in, 1742, the, imperial, government, at, saint, petersburg, ordered, a, russian, military, expedition, to, conquer, the, chukchi, and, koryaks, but, the, expedition, failed, and, its, commander, major, dmitry, pavlutsky, was, killed, in, 1747, on, 12, march, 1747, a, party, of, 500, chukchi, warriors, raided, the, russian, stockade, of, anadyrsk, by, 1750, it, had, become, clear, the, chukchi, would, be, difficult, to, conquer, the, empress, then, changed, her, tactical, approach, and, established, a, formal, peace, with, them, elizabeth, s, court, was, one, of, the, most, splendid, in, all, europe, as, historian, mikhail, shcherbatov, stated, the, court, was, arrayed, in, cloth, of, gold, her, nobles, satisfied, with, only, the, most, luxurious, garments, the, most, expensive, foods, the, rarest, drinks, that, largest, number, of, servants, and, they, applied, this, standard, of, lavishness, to, their, dress, as, well, a, great, number, of, silver, and, gold, objects, were, produced, the, most, the, country, had, seen, thus, far, in, its, history, it, was, common, to, order, over, a, thousand, bottles, of, french, champagnes, and, wines, to, be, served, at, one, event, and, to, serve, pineapples, at, all, receptions, despite, the, difficulty, of, procuring, the, fruit, in, such, quantities, french, plays, quickly, became, the, most, popular, and, often, were, performed, twice, a, week, in, tandem, music, became, very, important, many, attribute, its, popularity, to, elizabeth, s, supposed, husband, the, emperor, of, the, night, alexei, razumovsky, who, reportedly, relished, music, elizabeth, spared, no, expense, in, importing, leading, musical, talents, from, germany, france, and, italy, she, reportedly, owned, 15, 000, dresses, several, thousand, pairs, of, shoes, and, a, seemingly, unlimited, number, of, stockings, attractive, in, her, youth, and, vain, as, an, adult, elizabeth, passed, various, decrees, intended, to, make, herself, stand, out, she, issued, an, edict, against, anyone, wearing, the, same, hairstyle, dress, or, accessory, as, the, empress, one, woman, accidentally, wore, the, same, item, as, the, empress, and, was, lashed, across, the, face, for, it, another, law, required, french, fabric, salesmen, to, sell, to, the, empress, first, and, those, who, disregarded, that, law, were, arrested, one, famous, story, exemplifying, her, vanity, is, that, once, elizabeth, got, a, bit, of, powder, in, her, hair, and, was, unable, to, remove, it, except, by, cutting, a, patch, of, her, hair, she, made, all, of, the, court, ladies, cut, patches, out, of, their, hair, too, which, they, did, with, tears, in, their, eyes, this, aggressive, vanity, became, a, tenet, of, the, court, throughout, her, reign, particularly, as, she, grew, older, according, to, historian, tamara, talbot, rice, later, in, life, her, outbursts, of, anger, were, directed, either, against, people, who, were, thought, to, have, endangered, russia, s, security, or, against, women, whose, beauty, rivalled, her, own, despite, her, volatile, and, often, violent, reactions, to, others, regarding, her, appearance, elizabeth, was, ebullient, in, most, other, matters, particularly, when, it, came, to, court, entertainment, it, was, reported, that, she, threw, two, balls, a, week, one, would, be, a, large, event, with, an, average, of, 800, guests, in, attendance, most, of, whom, were, the, nation, s, leading, merchants, members, of, the, lower, nobility, and, guards, stationed, in, and, around, the, city, of, the, event, the, other, ball, was, a, much, smaller, affair, reserved, for, her, closest, friends, and, members, of, the, highest, echelons, of, nobility, the, smaller, gatherings, began, as, masked, balls, but, evolved, into, the, famous, metamorphoses, balls, by, 1744, at, these, metamorphoses, balls, guests, were, expected, to, dress, as, the, opposite, sex, with, elizabeth, often, dressing, up, as, cossack, or, carpenter, in, honour, of, her, father, costumes, not, permitted, at, the, event, were, those, of, pilgrims, and, harlequins, which, she, considered, profane, and, indecent, respectively, most, courtiers, thoroughly, disliked, the, balls, as, most, guests, by, decree, looked, ridiculous, but, elizabeth, adored, them, as, catherine, the, great, s, advisor, potemkin, posited, this, was, because, she, was, the, only, woman, who, looked, truly, fine, and, completely, a, man, as, she, was, tall, and, possessed, a, powerful, body, male, attire, suited, her, kazimierz, waliszewski, noted, that, elizabeth, had, beautiful, legs, and, loved, to, wear, male, attire, because, of, the, tight, trousers, though, the, balls, were, by, far, her, most, personally, beloved, and, lavish, events, elizabeth, often, threw, children, s, birthday, parties, and, wedding, receptions, for, those, affiliated, with, her, court, going, so, far, as, to, provide, dowries, for, each, of, her, ladies, in, waiting, in, the, late, 1750s, elizabeth, s, health, started, to, decline, she, suffered, a, series, of, dizzy, spells, and, refused, to, take, the, medication, she, had, been, prescribed, the, empress, forbade, the, word, death, in, her, presence, until, she, suffered, a, stroke, on, 24, december, 1761, o, s, knowing, that, she, was, dying, elizabeth, used, her, last, remaining, strength, to, make, her, confession, to, recite, with, her, confessor, the, prayer, for, the, dying, and, to, say, farewell, to, the, few, people, who, wished, to, be, with, her, including, peter, and, catherine, and, counts, alexei, and, kirill, razumovsky, the, empress, died, the, next, day, orthodox, christmas, 1761, for, her, lying, in, state, she, was, dressed, in, a, shimmering, silver, dress, it, was, said, that, she, was, beautiful, in, death, as, she, had, been, in, life, she, was, buried, in, the, peter, and, paul, cathedral, in, saint, petersburg, on, 3, february, 1762,
