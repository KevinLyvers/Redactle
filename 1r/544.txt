assurance, of, phrasing, and, intonation, but, there, was, also, an, outgoing, warmth, a, palpable, eagerness, to, reach, and, touch, the, audience, and, there, was, mocking, wit, a, smile, was, often, lightly, evident, on, her, lips, and, her, eyes, as, if, for, once, she, could, accept, the, fact, that, there, were, people, who, did, dig, her, the, beat, flowed, in, her, uniquely, sinuous, supple, way, of, moving, the, story, along, the, words, became, her, own, experiences, and, coursing, through, it, all, was, lady, s, sound, a, texture, simultaneously, steel, edged, and, yet, soft,
