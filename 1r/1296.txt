formerly, his, close, ally, richelieu, sought, to, consolidate, royal, power, and, restrained, the, power, of, the, nobility, in, order, to, transform, france, into, a, strong, centralized, state, in, foreign, policy, his, primary, objectives, were, to, check, the, power, of, the, habsburg, dynasty, reigning, notably, in, spain, and, austria, and, to, ensure, french, dominance, in, the, thirty, years, war, of, 1618, 1648, after, that, conflict, engulfed, europe, despite, suppressing, the, huguenot, rebellions, of, the, 1620s, he, made, alliances, with, protestant, states, like, the, kingdom, of, england, and, the, dutch, republic, to, help, him, achieve, his, goals, however, although, he, was, a, powerful, political, figure, in, his, own, right, events, such, as, the, day, of, the, dupes, french, journ, e, des, dupes, in, 1630, showed, that, richelieu, s, power, still, depended, on, the, king, s, confidence, an, alumnus, of, the, university, of, paris, and, headmaster, of, the, college, of, sorbonne, richelieu, renovated, and, extended, the, institution, he, became, famous, for, his, patronage, of, the, arts, and, founded, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, the, learned, society,

richelieu, in, 1629, born, in, paris, on, 9, september, 1585, armand, du, plessis, was, the, fourth, of, five, children, and, the, last, of, three, sons, he, was, delicate, from, childhood, and, suffered, frequent, bouts, of, ill, health, throughout, his, life, his, family, belonged, to, the, lesser, nobility, of, poitou, his, father, fran, ois, du, plessis, seigneur, de, richelieu, was, a, soldier, and, courtier, who, served, as, the, grand, provost, of, france, and, his, mother, susanne, de, la, porte, was, the, daughter, of, a, famous, jurist, when, he, was, five, years, old, richelieu, s, father, died, of, fever, in, the, french, wars, of, religion, leaving, the, family, in, debt, however, with, the, aid, of, royal, grants, the, family, was, able, to, avoid, financial, difficulties, at, the, age, of, 9, young, richelieu, was, sent, to, the, college, of, navarre, in, paris, to, study, philosophy, thereafter, he, began, to, train, for, a, military, career, there, he, learned, mathematics, fencing, horse, riding, dancing, skills, courtly, manners, and, military, drill, his, private, life, seems, to, have, been, typical, for, a, young, officer, of, the, era, in, 1605, aged, twenty, he, was, treated, by, th, odore, de, mayerne, for, gonorrhea, henry, iii, had, rewarded, richelieu, s, father, for, his, participation, in, the, wars, of, religion, by, granting, his, family, the, bishopric, of, lu, on, the, family, appropriated, most, of, the, revenues, of, the, bishopric, for, private, use, they, were, however, challenged, by, clergymen, who, desired, the, funds, for, ecclesiastical, purposes, to, protect, the, important, source, of, revenue, richelieu, s, mother, proposed, to, make, her, second, son, alphonse, the, bishop, of, lu, on, alphonse, who, had, no, desire, to, become, a, bishop, became, instead, a, carthusian, monk, thus, it, became, necessary, that, the, younger, richelieu, join, the, clergy, he, had, strong, academic, interests, and, threw, himself, into, studying, for, his, new, post, in, 1606, henry, iv, nominated, richelieu, to, become, bishop, of, lu, on, as, richelieu, had, not, yet, reached, the, canonical, minimum, age, it, was, necessary, that, he, journey, to, rome, for, a, special, dispensation, from, pope, paul, v, this, secured, richelieu, was, consecrated, bishop, in, april, 1607, soon, after, he, returned, to, his, diocese, in, 1608, richelieu, was, heralded, as, a, reformer, he, became, the, first, bishop, in, france, to, implement, the, institutional, reforms, prescribed, by, the, council, of, trent, between, 1545, and, 1563, at, about, this, time, richelieu, became, a, friend, of, fran, ois, leclerc, du, tremblay, better, known, as, p, re, joseph, or, father, joseph, a, capuchin, friar, who, would, later, become, a, close, confidant, because, of, his, closeness, to, richelieu, and, the, grey, colour, of, his, robes, father, joseph, was, also, nicknamed, l, minence, grise, lit, the, grey, eminence, later, richelieu, often, used, him, as, an, agent, during, diplomatic, negotiations, in, 1614, the, clergymen, of, poitou, asked, richelieu, to, be, one, of, their, representatives, to, the, estates, general, there, he, was, a, vigorous, advocate, of, the, catholic, church, arguing, that, it, should, be, exempt, from, taxes, and, that, bishops, should, have, more, political, power, he, was, the, most, prominent, clergyman, to, support, the, adoption, of, the, decrees, of, the, council, of, trent, throughout, france, the, third, estate, commoners, was, his, chief, opponent, in, this, endeavour, at, the, end, of, the, assembly, the, first, estate, the, clergy, chose, him, to, deliver, the, address, enumerating, its, petitions, and, decisions, soon, after, the, dissolution, of, the, estates, general, richelieu, entered, the, service, of, king, louis, xiii, s, wife, anne, of, austria, as, her, almoner, richelieu, advanced, politically, by, faithfully, serving, the, queen, mother, s, favourite, concino, concini, the, most, powerful, minister, in, the, kingdom, in, 1616, richelieu, was, made, secretary, of, state, and, was, given, responsibility, for, foreign, affairs, like, concini, the, bishop, was, one, of, the, closest, advisors, of, louis, xiii, s, mother, marie, de, medici, the, queen, had, become, regent, of, france, when, the, nine, year, old, louis, ascended, the, throne, although, her, son, reached, the, legal, age, of, majority, in, 1614, she, remained, the, effective, ruler, of, the, realm, however, her, policies, and, those, of, concini, proved, unpopular, with, many, in, france, as, a, result, both, marie, and, concini, became, the, targets, of, intrigues, at, court, their, most, powerful, enemy, was, charles, de, luynes, in, april, 1617, in, a, plot, arranged, by, luynes, louis, xiii, ordered, that, concini, be, arrested, and, killed, should, he, resist, concini, was, consequently, assassinated, and, marie, de, m, dicis, overthrown, his, patron, having, died, richelieu, also, lost, power, he, was, dismissed, as, secretary, of, state, and, was, removed, from, the, court, in, 1618, the, king, still, suspicious, of, the, bishop, of, lu, on, banished, him, to, avignon, there, richelieu, spent, most, of, his, time, writing, he, composed, a, catechism, titled, l, instruction, du, chr, tien, in, 1619, marie, de, m, dicis, escaped, from, her, confinement, in, the, ch, teau, de, blois, becoming, the, titular, leader, of, an, aristocratic, rebellion, the, king, and, the, duc, de, luynes, recalled, richelieu, believing, that, he, would, be, able, to, reason, with, the, queen, richelieu, was, successful, in, this, endeavour, mediating, between, her, and, her, son, complex, negotiations, bore, fruit, when, the, treaty, of, angoul, me, was, ratified, marie, de, m, dicis, was, given, complete, freedom, but, would, remain, at, peace, with, the, king, the, queen, mother, was, restored, to, the, royal, council, after, the, death, of, the, king, s, favourite, the, duc, de, luynes, in, 1621, richelieu, rose, to, power, quickly, the, year, after, the, king, nominated, richelieu, for, a, cardinalate, which, pope, gregory, xv, accordingly, granted, in, september, 1622, crises, in, france, including, a, rebellion, of, the, huguenots, rendered, richelieu, a, nearly, indispensable, advisor, to, the, king, after, he, was, appointed, to, the, royal, council, of, ministers, on, 29, april, 1624, he, intrigued, against, the, chief, minister, charles, duc, de, la, vieuville, on, 12, august, of, the, same, year, la, vieuville, was, arrested, on, charges, of, corruption, and, cardinal, richelieu, took, his, place, as, the, king, s, principal, minister, the, following, day, but, the, cardinal, de, la, rochefoucauld, nominally, remained, president, of, the, council, richelieu, was, officially, appointed, president, in, november, 1629, cardinal, richelieu, s, policy, involved, two, primary, goals, centralization, of, power, in, france, and, opposition, to, the, habsburg, dynasty, which, ruled, in, both, austria, and, spain, he, saw, the, reestablishment, of, the, catholic, orthodoxy, as, a, political, maneuver, of, the, habsburg, and, austrian, states, which, was, detrimental, to, the, french, national, interests, shortly, after, he, became, louis, principal, minister, he, was, faced, with, a, crisis, in, valtellina, a, valley, in, lombardy, northern, italy, to, counter, spanish, designs, on, the, territory, richelieu, supported, the, protestant, swiss, canton, of, grisons, which, also, claimed, the, strategically, important, valley, the, cardinal, deployed, troops, to, valtellina, from, which, the, pope, s, garrisons, were, driven, out, richelieu, s, early, decision, to, support, a, protestant, canton, against, the, pope, was, a, foretaste, of, the, purely, diplomatic, power, politics, he, espoused, in, his, foreign, policy, to, further, consolidate, power, in, france, richelieu, sought, to, suppress, the, influence, of, the, feudal, nobility, in, 1626, he, abolished, the, position, of, constable, of, france, and, ordered, all, fortified, castles, razed, with, the, exception, only, of, those, needed, to, defend, against, invaders, thus, he, stripped, the, princes, dukes, and, lesser, aristocrats, of, important, defences, that, could, have, been, used, against, the, king, s, armies, during, rebellions, as, a, result, richelieu, was, hated, by, most, of, the, nobility, another, obstacle, to, the, centralization, of, power, was, religious, division, in, france, the, huguenots, one, of, the, largest, political, and, religious, factions, in, the, country, controlled, a, significant, military, force, and, were, in, rebellion, moreover, charles, i, the, king, of, england, declared, war, on, france, in, an, attempt, to, aid, the, huguenot, faction, in, 1627, richelieu, ordered, the, army, to, besiege, the, huguenot, stronghold, of, la, rochelle, the, cardinal, personally, commanded, the, besieging, troops, english, troops, under, the, duke, of, buckingham, led, an, expedition, to, help, the, citizens, of, la, rochelle, but, failed, abysmally, the, city, however, remained, firm, for, over, a, year, before, capitulating, in, 1628, although, the, huguenots, suffered, a, major, defeat, at, la, rochelle, they, continued, to, fight, led, by, henri, duc, de, rohan, protestant, forces, however, were, defeated, in, 1629, rohan, submitted, to, the, terms, of, the, peace, of, alais, as, a, result, religious, toleration, for, protestants, which, had, first, been, granted, by, the, edict, of, nantes, in, 1598, was, permitted, to, continue, but, the, cardinal, abolished, their, political, rights, and, protections, rohan, was, not, executed, as, were, leaders, of, rebellions, later, in, richelieu, s, tenure, in, fact, he, later, became, a, commanding, officer, in, the, french, army, habsburg, spain, exploited, the, french, conflict, with, the, huguenots, to, extend, its, influence, in, northern, italy, it, funded, the, huguenot, rebels, to, keep, the, french, army, occupied, meanwhile, expanding, its, italian, dominions, richelieu, however, responded, aggressively, after, la, rochelle, capitulated, he, personally, led, the, french, army, to, northern, italy, to, restrain, spain, on, 26, november, 1629, he, was, created, duc, de, richelieu, and, a, peer, of, france, in, the, next, year, richelieu, s, position, was, seriously, threatened, by, his, former, patron, marie, de, m, dicis, marie, believed, that, the, cardinal, had, robbed, her, of, her, political, influence, thus, she, demanded, that, her, son, dismiss, the, chief, minister, louis, xiii, was, not, at, first, averse, to, such, a, course, of, action, as, he, personally, disliked, richelieu, despite, this, the, persuasive, statesman, was, able, to, secure, the, king, as, an, ally, against, his, own, mother, on, 11, november, 1630, marie, de, m, dicis, and, the, king, s, brother, gaston, duc, d, orl, ans, secured, the, king, s, agreement, for, the, dismissal, richelieu, however, was, aware, of, the, plan, and, quickly, convinced, the, king, to, repent, meanwhile, marie, de, m, dicis, was, exiled, to, compi, gne, both, marie, and, the, duc, d, orl, ans, continued, to, conspire, against, richelieu, but, their, schemes, came, to, nothing, the, nobility, also, remained, powerless, the, only, important, rising, was, that, of, henri, duc, de, montmorency, in, 1632, richelieu, ruthless, in, suppressing, opposition, ordered, the, duke, s, execution, in, 1634, the, cardinal, had, one, of, his, outspoken, critics, urbain, grandier, burned, at, the, stake, in, the, loudun, affair, these, and, other, harsh, measures, were, orchestrated, by, richelieu, to, intimidate, his, enemies, he, also, ensured, his, political, security, by, establishing, a, large, network, of, spies, in, france, and, in, other, european, countries, before, richelieu, s, ascent, to, power, most, of, europe, had, become, enmeshed, in, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, france, was, not, openly, at, war, with, the, habsburgs, who, ruled, spain, and, the, holy, roman, empire, so, subsidies, and, aid, were, provided, secretly, to, their, adversaries, richelieu, however, believed, that, war, against, spain, would, be, unavoidable, he, considered, the, dutch, republic, as, one, of, france, s, most, important, allies, for, it, bordered, directly, with, the, spanish, netherlands, and, was, right, in, the, middle, of, the, eighty, years, war, with, spain, at, that, time, luckily, for, him, richelieu, was, a, bon, fran, ais, just, like, the, king, who, had, already, decided, to, subsidize, the, dutch, to, fight, against, the, spanish, via, the, treaty, of, compi, gne, in, june, 1624, prior, to, richelieu, s, appointment, to, first, minister, in, august, that, same, year, a, military, expedition, secretly, financed, by, france, and, commanded, by, marquis, de, coeuvres, started, an, action, with, the, intention, of, liberating, the, valtelline, from, spanish, occupation, in, 1625, richelieu, also, sent, money, to, ernst, von, mansfeld, a, famous, mercenary, general, operating, in, germany, in, english, service, however, in, may, 1626, when, war, costs, had, almost, ruined, france, king, and, cardinal, made, peace, with, spain, via, the, treaty, of, mon, on, this, peace, quickly, ended, after, tensions, due, to, the, war, of, the, mantuan, succession, in, 1629, emperor, ferdinand, ii, subjugated, many, of, his, protestant, opponents, in, germany, richelieu, alarmed, by, ferdinand, s, growing, influence, incited, sweden, to, intervene, providing, money, in, the, meantime, france, and, spain, remained, hostile, due, to, spain, s, ambitions, in, northern, italy, at, that, time, northern, italy, was, a, major, strategic, region, in, europe, s, balance, of, power, serving, as, a, link, between, the, habsburgs, in, the, empire, and, in, spain, had, the, imperial, armies, dominated, this, region, france, would, have, been, threatened, by, habsburg, encirclement, spain, was, meanwhile, seeking, papal, approval, for, a, universal, monarchy, when, in, 1630, french, diplomats, in, regensburg, agreed, to, make, peace, with, spain, richelieu, refused, to, support, them, the, agreement, would, have, prohibited, french, interference, in, germany, therefore, richelieu, advised, louis, xiii, to, refuse, to, ratify, the, treaty, in, 1631, he, allied, france, to, sweden, which, had, just, invaded, the, empire, in, the, treaty, of, b, rwalde, military, expenses, placed, a, considerable, strain, on, royal, revenues, in, response, richelieu, raised, the, gabelle, salt, tax, and, the, taille, land, tax, the, taille, was, enforced, to, provide, funds, to, raise, armies, and, wage, war, the, clergy, nobility, and, high, bourgeoisie, either, were, exempt, or, could, easily, avoid, payment, so, the, burden, fell, on, the, poorest, segment, of, the, nation, to, collect, taxes, more, efficiently, and, to, keep, corruption, to, a, minimum, richelieu, bypassed, local, tax, officials, replacing, them, with, intendants, officials, in, the, direct, service, of, the, crown, richelieu, s, financial, scheme, however, caused, unrest, among, the, peasants, there, were, several, uprisings, in, 1636, to, 1639, richelieu, crushed, the, revolts, violently, and, dealt, with, the, rebels, harshly, because, he, openly, aligned, france, with, protestant, powers, richelieu, was, denounced, by, many, as, a, traitor, to, the, roman, catholic, church, he, ordered, ships, of, war, from, jean, bicker, military, action, at, first, was, disastrous, for, the, french, with, many, victories, going, to, spain, and, the, empire, neither, side, however, could, obtain, a, decisive, advantage, and, the, conflict, lingered, on, after, richelieu, s, death, richelieu, was, instrumental, in, redirecting, the, thirty, years, war, from, the, conflict, of, protestantism, versus, catholicism, to, that, of, nationalism, versus, habsburg, hegemony, in, this, conflict, france, effectively, drained, the, already, overstretched, resources, of, the, habsburg, empire, and, drove, it, inexorably, towards, bankruptcy, the, defeat, of, habsburg, forces, at, the, battle, of, lens, in, 1648, coupled, with, their, failure, to, prevent, a, french, invasion, of, catalonia, effectively, spelled, the, end, for, habsburg, domination, of, the, continent, and, for, the, personal, career, of, spanish, prime, minister, olivares, when, richelieu, came, to, power, new, france, where, the, french, had, a, foothold, since, jacques, cartier, had, no, more, than, 100, permanent, european, inhabitants, richelieu, encouraged, louis, xiii, to, colonize, the, americas, by, the, foundation, of, the, compagnie, de, la, nouvelle, france, in, imitation, of, the, dutch, west, india, company, unlike, the, other, colonial, powers, france, encouraged, a, peaceful, coexistence, in, new, france, between, natives, and, colonists, and, sought, the, integration, of, indians, into, colonial, society, samuel, de, champlain, governor, of, new, france, at, the, time, of, richelieu, saw, intermarriage, between, french, and, indians, as, a, solution, to, increase, population, in, its, colony, under, the, guidance, of, richelieu, louis, xiii, issued, the, ordonnance, of, 1627, by, which, the, indians, converted, to, catholicism, were, considered, as, natural, frenchmen, the, descendants, of, the, french, who, are, accustomed, to, this, country, together, with, all, the, indians, who, will, be, brought, to, the, knowledge, of, the, faith, and, will, profess, it, shall, be, deemed, and, renowned, natural, frenchmen, and, as, such, may, come, to, live, in, france, when, they, want, and, acquire, donate, and, succeed, and, accept, donations, and, legacies, just, as, true, french, subjects, without, being, required, to, take, letters, of, declaration, of, naturalization, the, 1666, census, of, new, france, conducted, some, 20, years, after, the, death, of, cardinal, richelieu, showed, a, population, of, 3, 215, habitants, in, new, france, many, more, than, there, had, been, only, a, few, decades, earlier, but, also, a, great, difference, in, the, number, of, men, 2, 034, and, women, 1, 181, toward, the, end, of, his, life, richelieu, alienated, many, people, including, pope, urban, viii, richelieu, was, displeased, by, the, pope, s, refusal, to, name, him, the, papal, legate, in, france, in, turn, the, pope, did, not, approve, of, the, administration, of, the, french, church, or, of, french, foreign, policy, however, the, conflict, was, largely, resolved, when, the, pope, granted, a, cardinalate, to, jules, mazarin, one, of, richelieu, s, main, political, allies, in, 1641, despite, troubled, relations, with, the, roman, catholic, church, richelieu, did, not, support, the, complete, repudiation, of, papal, authority, in, france, as, was, advocated, by, the, gallicanists, as, he, neared, death, richelieu, faced, a, plot, that, threatened, to, remove, him, from, power, the, cardinal, had, introduced, a, young, man, named, henri, coiffier, de, ruz, marquis, de, cinq, mars, to, louis, xiii, s, court, the, cardinal, had, been, a, friend, of, cinq, mars, s, father, more, importantly, richelieu, hoped, that, cinq, mars, would, become, louis, s, favourite, so, that, he, could, indirectly, exercise, greater, influence, over, the, monarch, s, decisions, cinq, mars, had, become, the, royal, favourite, by, 1639, but, contrary, to, cardinal, richelieu, s, belief, he, was, not, easy, to, control, the, young, marquis, realized, that, richelieu, would, not, permit, him, to, gain, political, power, in, 1641, he, participated, in, the, comte, de, soissons, s, failed, conspiracy, against, richelieu, but, was, not, discovered, then, the, following, year, he, schemed, with, leading, nobles, including, the, king, s, brother, the, duc, d, orl, ans, to, raise, a, rebellion, he, also, signed, a, secret, agreement, with, the, king, of, spain, who, promised, to, aid, the, rebels, richelieu, s, spy, service, however, discovered, the, plot, and, the, cardinal, received, a, copy, of, the, treaty, cinq, mars, was, promptly, arrested, and, executed, although, louis, approved, the, use, of, capital, punishment, he, grew, more, distant, from, richelieu, as, a, result, however, richelieu, was, now, dying, for, many, years, he, had, suffered, from, recurrent, fevers, possibly, malaria, strangury, intestinal, tuberculosis, with, fistula, and, migraine, now, his, right, arm, was, suppurating, with, tubercular, osteitis, and, he, coughed, blood, after, his, death, his, lungs, were, found, to, have, extensive, cavities, and, caseous, necrosis, his, doctors, continued, to, bleed, him, frequently, further, weakening, him, as, he, felt, his, death, approaching, he, named, mazarin, one, of, his, most, faithful, followers, to, succeed, him, as, chief, minister, to, the, king, richelieu, died, on, 4, december, 1642, aged, 57, his, body, was, embalmed, and, interred, at, the, church, of, the, sorbonne, by, that, time, the, populace, detested, him, in, many, provinces, of, the, kingdom, bonfires, were, kindled, to, celebrate, his, death, during, the, french, revolution, the, corpse, was, removed, from, its, tomb, and, the, mummified, front, of, his, head, having, been, removed, and, replaced, during, the, original, embalming, process, was, stolen, it, ended, up, in, the, possession, of, nicholas, armez, of, brittany, by, 1796, and, he, occasionally, exhibited, the, well, preserved, face, his, nephew, louis, philippe, armez, inherited, it, and, also, occasionally, exhibited, it, and, lent, it, out, for, study, in, 1866, napoleon, iii, persuaded, armez, to, return, the, face, to, the, government, for, re, interment, with, the, rest, of, richelieu, s, body, an, investigation, of, subsidence, of, the, church, floor, enabled, the, head, to, be, photographed, in, 1895, richelieu, was, a, chess, player, and, a, famous, patron, of, the, arts, an, author, of, various, religious, and, political, works, most, notably, his, political, testament, he, sent, his, agents, abroad, in, search, of,
