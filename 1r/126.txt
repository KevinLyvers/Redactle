hobbies, drawing, and, writing, poems, were, not, fostered, in, the, same, way, as, music, was, in, his, early, years, following, his, parents, wishes, klee, focused, on, becoming, a, musician, but, he, decided, on, the, visual, arts, during, his, teen, years, partly, out, of, rebellion, and, partly, because, modern, music, lacked, meaning, for, him, he, stated, i, didn, t, find, the, idea, of, going, in, for, music, creatively, particularly, attractive, in, view, of, the, decline, in, the, history, of, musical, achievement, as, a, musician, he, played, and, felt, emotionally, bound, to, traditional, works, of, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, century, but, as, an, artist, he, craved, the, freedom, to, explore, radical, ideas, and, styles, at, sixteen, klee, s, landscape, drawings, already, show, considerable, skill, around, 1897, klee, started, his, diary, which, he, kept, until, 1918, and, which, has, provided, scholars, with, valuable, insight, into, his, life, and, thinking,

exams, at, the, gymnasium, of, bern, where, he, qualified, in, the, humanities, with, his, characteristic, dry, wit, he, wrote, after, all, it, s, rather, difficult, to, achieve, the, exact, minimum, and, it, involves, risks, on, his, own, time, in, addition, to, his, deep, interests, in, music, and, art, klee, was, a, great, reader, of, literature, and, later, a, writer, on, art, theory, and, aesthetics, with, his, parents, reluctant, permission, in, 1898, klee, began, studying, art, at, the, academy, of, fine, arts, in, munich, with, heinrich, knirr, and, franz, von, stuck, he, excelled, at, drawing, but, seemed, to, lack, any, natural, color, sense, he, later, recalled, during, the, third, winter, i, even, realized, that, i, probably, would, never, learn, to, paint, during, these, times, of, youthful, adventure, klee, spent, much, time, in, pubs, and, had, affairs, with, lower, class, women, and, artists, models, he, had, an, illegitimate, son, in, 1900, who, died, several, weeks, after, birth, after, receiving, his, fine, arts, degree, klee, traveled, in, italy, from, october, 1901, to, may, 1902, with, friend, hermann, haller, they, visited, rome, florence, naples, and, the, amalfi, coast, studying, the, master, painters, of, past, centuries, he, exclaimed, the, forum, and, the, vatican, have, spoken, to, me, humanism, wants, to, suffocate, me, he, responded, to, the, colors, of, italy, but, sadly, noted, that, a, long, struggle, lies, in, store, for, me, in, this, field, of, color, for, klee, color, represented, the, optimism, and, nobility, in, art, and, a, hope, for, relief, from, the, pessimistic, nature, he, expressed, in, his, black, and, white, grotesques, and, satires, returning, to, bern, he, lived, with, his, parents, for, several, years, and, took, occasional, art, classes, by, 1905, he, was, developing, some, experimental, techniques, including, drawing, with, a, needle, on, a, blackened, pane, of, glass, resulting, in, fifty, seven, works, including, his, portrait, of, my, father, 1906, in, the, years, 1903, 05, he, also, completed, a, cycle, of, eleven, zinc, plate, etchings, called, inventions, his, first, exhibited, works, in, which, he, illustrated, several, grotesque, characters, he, commented, though, i, m, fairly, satisfied, with, my, etchings, i, can, t, go, on, like, this, i, m, not, a, specialist, klee, was, still, dividing, his, time, with, music, playing, the, violin, in, an, orchestra, and, writing, concert, and, theater, reviews, klee, married, bavarian, pianist, lily, stumpf, in, 1906, and, they, had, one,

art, work, his, attempt, to, be, a, magazine, illustrator, failed, klee, s, art, work, progressed, slowly, for, the, next, five, years, partly, from, having, to, divide, his, time, with, domestic, matters, and, partly, as, he, tried, to, find, a, new, approach, to, his, art, in, 1910, he, had, his, first, solo, exhibition, in, bern, which, then, travelled, to, three, swiss, cities, in, january, 1911, alfred, kubin, met, klee, in, munich, and, encouraged, him, to, illustrate, voltaire, s, candide, his, resultant, drawings, were, published, later, in, a, 1920, version, of, the, book, edited, by, kurt, wolff, around, this, time, klee, s, graphic, work, increased, his, early, inclination, towards, the, absurd, and, the, sarcastic, was, well, received, by, kubin, who, befriended, klee, and, became, one, of, his, first, significant, collectors, klee, met, through, kubin, the, art, critic, wilhelm, hausenstein, in, 1911, klee, was, a, foundation, member, and, manager, of, the, munich, artists, union, sema, that, summer, in, autumn, he, made, an, acquaintance, with, august, macke, and, wassily, kandinsky, and, in, winter, he, joined, the, editorial, team, of, the, almanac, der, blaue, reiter, founded, by, franz, marc, and, kandinsky, on, meeting, kandinsky, klee, recorded, i, came, to, feel, a, deep, trust, in, him, he, is, somebody, and, has, an, exceptionally, beautiful, and, lucid, mind, other, members, included, macke, gabriele, m, nter, and, marianne, von, werefkin, klee, became, in, a, few, months, one, of, the, most, important, and, independent, members, of, the, blaue, reiter, but, he, was, not, yet, fully, integrated, the, release, of, the, almanac, was, delayed, for, the, benefit, of, an, exhibition, the, first, blaue, reiter, exhibition, took, place, from, 18, december, 1911, to, 1, january, 1912, in, the, moderne, galerie, heinrich, thannhauser, in, munich, klee, did, not, attend, it, but, in, the, second, exhibition, which, occurred, from, 12, february, to, 18, march, 1912, in, the, galerie, goltz, 17, of, his, graphic, works, were, shown, the, name, of, this, art, exhibition, was, schwarz, wei, as, it, only, regarded, graphic, painting, initially, planned, to, be, released, in, 1911, the, release, date, of, the, der, blau, reiter, almanac, by, kandinsky, and, marc, was, delayed, in, may, 1912, including, the, reproduced, ink, drawing, steinhauer, by, klee, at, the, same, time, kandinsky, published, his, art, history, writing, ber, das, geistige, in, der, kunst, the, association, opened, klee, s, mind, to, modern, theories, of, color, his, travels, to, paris, in, 1912, also, exposed, him, to, the, ferment, of, cubism, and, the, pioneering, examples, of, pure, painting, an, early, term, for, abstract, art, the, use, of, bold, color, by, robert, delaunay, and, maurice, de, vlaminck, also, inspired, him, rather, than, copy, these, artists, klee, began, working, out, his, own, color, experiments, in, pale, watercolors, and, did, some, primitive, landscapes, including, in, the, quarry, 1913, and, houses, near, the, gravel, pit, 1913, using, blocks, of, color, with, limited, overlap, klee, acknowledged, that, a, long, struggle, lies, in, store, for, me, in, this, field, of, color, in, order, to, reach, his, distant, noble, aim, soon, he, discovered, the, style, which, connects, drawing, and, the, realm, of, color, klee, s, artistic, breakthrough, came, in, 1914, when, he, briefly, visited, tunisia, with, august, macke, and, louis, moilliet, and, was, impressed, by, the, quality, of, the, light, there, he, wrote, color, has, taken, possession, of, me, no, longer, do, i, have, to, chase, after, it, i, know, that, it, has, hold, of, me, forever, color, and, i, are, one, i, am, a, painter, with, that, realization, faithfulness, to, nature, faded, in, importance, instead, klee, began, to, delve, into, the, cool, romanticism, of, abstraction, in, gaining, a, second, artistic, vocabulary, klee, added, color, to, his, abilities, in, draftsmanship, and, in, many, works, combined, them, successfully, as, he, did, in, one, series, he, called, operatic, paintings, one, of, the, most, literal, examples, of, this, new, synthesis, is, the, bavarian, don, giovanni, 1919, after, returning, home, klee, painted, his, first, pure, abstract, in, the, style, of, kairouan, 1914, composed, of, colored, rectangles, and, a, few, circles, the, colored, rectangle, became, his, basic, building, block, what, some, scholars, associate, with, a, musical, note, which, klee, combined, with, other, colored, blocks, to, create, a, color, harmony, analogous, to, a, musical, composition, his, selection, of, a, particular, color, palette, emulates, a, musical, key, sometimes, he, uses, complementary, pairs, of, colors, and, other, times, dissonant, colors, again, reflecting, his, connection, with, musicality, a, few, weeks, later, world, war, i, began, at, first, klee, was, somewhat, detached, from, it, as, he, wrote, ironically, i, have, long, had, this, war, in, me, that, is, why, inwardly, it, is, none, of, my, concern, klee, was, conscripted, as, a, landsturmsoldat, soldier, of, the, reserve, forces, in, prussia, or, imperial, germany, on, 5, march, 1916, the, deaths, of, his, friends, august, macke, and, franz, marc, in, battle, began, to, affect, him, venting, his, distress, he, created, several, pen, and, ink, lithographs, on, war, themes, including, death, for, the, idea, 1915, after, finishing, the, military, training, course, which, began, on, 11, march, 1916, he, was, committed, as, a, soldier, behind, the, front, klee, moved, on, 20, august, to, the, aircraft, maintenance, company, in, oberschleissheim, executing, skilled, manual, work, such, as, restoring, aircraft, camouflage, and, accompanying, aircraft, transports, on, 17, january, 1917, he, was, transferred, to, the, royal, bavarian, flying, school, in, gersthofen, which, 54, years, later, became, the, usasa, field, station, augsburg, to, work, as, a, clerk, for, the, treasurer, until, the, end, of, the, war, this, allowed, him, to, stay, in, a, small, room, outside, of, the, barrack, block, and, continue, painting, he, continued, to, paint, during, the, entire, war, and, managed, to, exhibit, in, several, shows, by, 1917, klee, s, work, was, selling, well, and, art, critics, acclaimed, him, as, the, best, of, the, new, german, artists, his, ab, ovo, 1917, is, particularly, noteworthy, for, its, sophisticated, technique, it, employs, watercolor, on, gauze, and, paper, with, a, chalk, ground, which, produces, a, rich, texture, of, triangular, circular, and, crescent, patterns, demonstrating, his, range, of, exploration, mixing, color, and, line, his, warning, of, the, ships, 1918, is, a, colored, drawing, filled, with, symbolic, images, on, a, field, of, suppressed, color, in, 1919, klee, applied, for, a, teaching, post, at, the, academy, of, art, in, stuttgart, this, attempt, failed, but, he, had, a, major, success, in, securing, a, three, year, contract, with, a, minimum, annual, income, with, dealer, hans, goltz, whose, influential, gallery, gave, klee, major, exposure, and, some, commercial, success, a, retrospective, of, over, 300, works, in, 1920, was, also, notable, klee, taught, at, the, bauhaus, from, january, 1921, to, april, 1931, he, was, a, form, master, in, the, bookbinding, stained, glass, and, mural, painting, workshops, and, was, provided, with, two, studios, in, 1922, kandinsky, joined, the, staff, and, resumed, his, friendship, with, klee, later, that, year, the, first, bauhaus, exhibition, and, festival, was, held, for, which, klee, created, several, of, the, advertising, materials, klee, welcomed, the, many, conflicting, theories, and, opinions, within, the, bauhaus, i, also, approve, of, these, forces, competing, one, with, the, other, if, the, result, is, achievement, klee, was, also, a, member, of, die, blaue, vier, the, blue, four, with, kandinsky, lyonel, feininger, and, alexej, von, jawlensky, which, formed, in, 1923, at, the, instigation, of, galka, scheyer, who, subsequently, organized, exhibitions, of, their, work, in, the, united, states, in, 1924, klee, had, his, first, exhibits, in, paris, and, he, became, a, hit, with, the, french, surrealists, klee, visited, egypt, in, 1928, which, impressed, him, less, than, tunisia, in, 1929, the, first, major, monograph, on, klee, s, work, was, published, written, by, will, grohmann, klee, also, taught, at, the, d, sseldorf, academy, from, 1931, to, 1933, and, was, singled, out, by, a, nazi, newspaper, then, that, great, fellow, klee, comes, onto, the, scene, already, famed, as, a, bauhaus, teacher, in, dessau, he, tells, everyone, he, s, a, thoroughbred, arab, but, he, s, a, typical, galician, jew, his, home, was, searched, by, the, gestapo, and, he, was, fired, from, his, job, his, self, portrait, struck, from, the, list, 1933, commemorates, the, sad, occasion, in, 1933, 34, klee, had, shows, in, london, and, paris, and, finally, met, pablo, picasso, whom, he, greatly, admired, the, klee, family, emigrated, to, switzerland, in, late, 1933, klee, was, at, the, peak, of, his, creative, output, his, ad, parnassum, 1932, is, considered, his, masterpiece, and, the, best, example, of, his, pointillist, style, it, is, also, one, of, his, largest, most, finely, worked, paintings, he, produced, nearly, 500, works, in, 1933, during, his, last, year, in, germany, however, in, 1933, klee, began, experiencing, the, symptoms, of, what, was, diagnosed, as, scleroderma, after, his, death, the, progression, of, his, fatal, disease, which, made, swallowing, very, difficult, can, be, followed, through, the, art, he, created, in, his, last, years, his, output, in, 1936, was, only, 25, pictures, in, the, later, 1930s, his, health, recovered, somewhat, and, he, was, encouraged, by, a, visit, from, kandinsky, and, picasso, klee, s, simpler, and, larger, designs, enabled, him, to, keep, up, his, output, in, his, final, years, and, in, 1939, he, created, over, 1, 200, works, a, career, high, for, one, year, he, used, heavier, lines, and, mainly, geometric, forms, with, fewer, but, larger, blocks, of, color, his, varied, color, palettes, some, with, bright, colors, and, others, somber, perhaps, reflected, his, alternating, moods, of, optimism, and, pessimism, back, in, germany, in, 1937, seventeen, of, klee, s, pictures, were, included, in, an, exhibition, of, degenerate, art, and, 102, of, his, works, in, public, collections, were, seized, by, the, nazis, in, 1935, two, years, after, moving, to, switzerland, and, working, in, a, very, confined, situation, klee, developed, scleroderma, an, autoimmune, disease, resulting, in, hardening, of, connective, tissue, he, endured, pain, that, seems, to, be, reflected, in, his, last, works, of, art, in, his, last, months, he, created, 50, drawings, of, angels, one, of, his, last, paintings, death, and, fire, features, a, skull, in, the, center, with, the, german, word, for, death, tod, appearing, in, the, face, he, died, in, muralto, locarno, switzerland, on, 29, june, 1940, without, having, obtained, swiss, citizenship, despite, his, birth, in, that, country, his, art, work, was, considered, too, revolutionary, even, degenerate, by, the, swiss, authorities, but, eventually, they, accepted, his, request, six, days, after, his, death, his, legacy, comprised, about, 9, 000, works, of, art, the, words, on, his, tombstone, klee, s, credo, placed, there, by, his, son, felix, say, i, cannot, be, grasped, in, the, here, and, now, for, my, dwelling, place, is, as, much, among, the, dead, as, the, yet, unborn, slightly, closer, to, the, heart, of, creation, than, usual, but, still, not, close, enough, he, was, buried, at, schosshaldenfriedhof, bern, switzerland, klee, has, been, variously, associated, with, expressionism, cubism, futurism, surrealism, and, abstraction, but, his, pictures, are, difficult, to, classify, he, generally, worked, in, isolation, from, his, peers, and, interpreted, new, art, trends, in, his, own, way, he, was, inventive, in, his, methods, and, technique, klee, worked, in, many, different, media, oil, paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and, others, he, often, combined, them, into, one, work, he, used, canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal, foils, fabric, wallpaper, and, newsprint, klee, employed, spray, paint, knife, application, stamping, glazing, and, impasto, and, mixed, media, such, as, oil, with, watercolor, watercolor, with, pen, and, india, ink, and, oil, with, tempera, he, was, a, natural, draftsman, and, through, long, experimentation, developed, a, mastery, of, color, and, tonality, many, of, his, works, combine, these, skills, he, uses, a, great, variety, of, color, palettes, from, nearly, monochromatic, to, highly, polychromatic, his, works, often, have, a, fragile, childlike, quality, to, them, and, are, usually, on, a, small, scale, he, often, used, geometric, forms, and, grid, format, compositions, as, well, as, letters, and, numbers, frequently, combined, with, playful, figures, of, animals, and, people, some, works, were, completely, abstract, many, of, his, works, and, their, titles, reflect, his, dry, humor, and, varying, moods, some, express, political, convictions, they, frequently, allude, to, poetry, music, and, dreams, and, sometimes, include, words, or, musical, notation, the, later, works, are, distinguished, by, spidery, hieroglyph, like, symbols, rainer, maria, rilke, wrote, about, klee, in, 1921, even, if, you, hadn, t, told, me, he, plays, the, violin, i, would, have, guessed, that, on, many, occasions, his, drawings, were, transcriptions, of, music, pamela, kort, observed, klee, s, 1933, drawings, present, their, beholder, with, an, unparalleled, opportunity, to, glimpse, a, central, aspect, of, his, aesthetics, that, has, remained, largely, unappreciated, his, lifelong, concern, with, the, possibilities, of, parody, and, wit, herein, lies, their, real, significance, particularly, for, an, audience, unaware, that, klee, s, art, has, political, dimensions, among, the, few, plastic, works, are, hand, puppets, made, between, 1916, and, 1925, for, his, son, felix, the, artist, neither, counted, them, as, a, component, of, his, oeuvre, nor, did, he, list, them, in, his, catalogue, raisonn, thirty, of, the, preserved, puppets, are, stored, at, the, zentrum, paul, klee, bern, some, of, klee, s, early, preserved, children, s, drawings, which, his, grandmother, encouraged, were, listed, on, his, catalogue, raisonn, a, total, of, 19, etchings, were, produced, during, the, bern, years, ten, of, these, were, made, between, 1903, and, 1905, in, the, cycle, inventionen, inventions, which, were, presented, in, june, 1906, at, the, internationale, kunstausstellung, des, vereins, bildender, k, nstler, m, nchens, secession, international, art, exhibition, of, the, association, for, graphic, arts, munich, secession, his, first, appearance, as, a, painter, in, the, public, klee, had, removed, the, third, invention, pessimistische, allegorie, des, gebirges, pessimistic, allegory, of, the, mountain, in, february, 1906, from, his, cycle, the, satirical, etchings, for, example, jungfrau, im, baum, jungfrau, tr, umend, virgin, on, the, tree, virgin, dreaming, from, 1903, and, greiser, phoenix, aged, phoenix, from, 1905, were, classified, by, klee, as, surrealistic, outposts, jungfrau, im, baum, ties, on, the, motive, le, cattive, madri, 1894, by, giovanni, segantini, the, picture, was, influenced, by, grotesque, lyric, poetries, of, alfred, jarry, max, jacob, and, christian, morgenstern, it, features, a, cultural, pessimism, which, can, be, found, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, in, works, by, symbolists, the, invention, nr, 6, the, 1903, etching, zwei, m, nner, einander, in, h, herer, stellung, vermutend, two, men, supposing, the, other, to, be, in, a, higher, position, depicts, two, naked, men, presumably, emperor, wilhelm, ii, and, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, recognizable, by, their, hairstyle, and, beards, as, their, clothes, and, insignia, were, bereft, both, of, them, have, no, clue, if, their, conventional, salute, is, in, order, or, not, as, they, assume, that, their, counterpart, could, have, been, higher, rated, they, bow, and, scrape, klee, began, to, introduce, a, new, technique, in, 1905, scratching, on, a, blackened, glass, panel, with, a, needle, in, that, manner, he, created, about, 57, verre, glomis, pictures, among, those, the, 1905, gartenszene, scene, on, a, garden, and, the, 1906, portr, t, des, vaters, portrait, of, a, father, with, which, he, tried, to, combine, painting, and, scratching, klee, s, solitary, early, work, ended, in, 1911, the, year, he, met, and, was, inspired, by, the, graphic, artist, alfred, kubin, and, became, associated, with, the, artists, of, the, blaue, reiter, during, his, twelve, day, educational, trip, to, tunis, in, april, 1914, klee, produced, with, macke, and, moilliet, watercolor, paintings, which, implement, the, strong, light, and, color, stimulus, of, the, north, african, countryside, in, the, fashion, of, paul, c, zanne, and, robert, delaunay, s, cubistic, form, concepts, the, aim, was, not, to, imitate, nature, but, to, create, compositions, analogous, to, nature, s, formative, principle, as, in, the, works, in, den, h, usern, von, saint, germain, in, the, houses, of, saint, germain, and, stra, encaf, streetcaf, klee, conveyed, the, scenery, in, a, grid, so, that, it, dissolves, into, colored, harmony, he, also, created, abstract, works, in, that,

took, place, it, took, over, ten, years, that, klee, worked, on, experiments, and, analysis, of, the, color, resulting, to, an, independent, artificial, work, whereby, his, design, ideas, were, based, on, the, colorful, oriental, world, f, hn, im, marc, schen, garten, foehn, at, marc, s, garden, was, made, after, the, turin, trip, it, indicates, the, relations, between, color, and, the, stimulus, of, macke, and, delaunay, although, elements, of, the, garden, are, clearly, visible, a, further, steering, towards, abstraction, is, noticeable, in, his, diary, klee, wrote, the, following, note, at, that, time, in, the, large, molding, pit, are, lying, ruins, on, which, one, partially, hangs, they, provide, the, material, for, the, abstraction, the, terrible, the, world, the, abstract, the, art, while, a, happy, world, produces, secularistic, art, under, the, impression, of, his, military, service, he, created, the, painting, trauerblumen, velvetbells, in, 1917, which, with, its, graphical, signs, vegetal, and, phantastic, shapes, is, a, forerunner, of, his, future, works, harmonically, combining, graphic, color, and, object, for, the, first, time, birds, appear, in, the, pictures, such, as, in, blumenmythos, flower, myth, from, 1918, mirroring, the, flying, and, falling, planes, he, saw, in, gersthofen, and, the, photographed, plane, crashes, in, the, 1918, watercolor, painting, einst, dem, grau, der, nacht, enttaucht, a, compositional, implemented, poem, possibly, written, by, klee, he, incorporated, letters, in, small, in, terms, of, color, separated, squares, cutting, off, the, first, verse, from, the, second, one, with, silver, paper, at, the, top, of, the, cardboard, which, carries, the, picture, the, verses, are, inscribed, in, manuscript, form, here, klee, did, not, lean, on, delaunay, s, colors, but, on, marc, s, although, the, picture, content, of, both, painters, does, not, correspond, with, each, other, herwarth, walden, klee, s, art, dealer, saw, in, them, a, wachabl, sung, changing, of, the, guard, of, his, art, since, 1919, he, often, used, oil, colors, with, which, he, combined, watercolors, and, colored, pencil, the, villa, r, kunstmuseum, basel, from, 1919, unites, visible, realities, such, as, sun, moon, mountains, trees, and, architectures, as, well, as, surreal, pledges, and, sentiment, readings, his, works, during, this, time, include, camel, in, rhythmic, landscape, with, trees, as, well, as, other, paintings, with, abstract, graphical, elements, such, as, betroffener, ort, affected, place, 1922, from, that, period, he, created, die, zwitscher, maschine, the, twittering, machine, which, was, later, removed, from, the, national, gallery, after, being, named, defamatory, in, the, munich, exhibition, entartete, kunst, the, painting, was, later, bought, by, the, buchholz, gallery, new, york, and, then, transferred, in, 1939, to, the, museum, of, modern, art, the, twittering, in, the, title, refers, to, the, open, beaked, birds, while, the, machine, is, illustrated, by, the, crank, the, watercolor, painting, appears, at, a, first, glance, childish, but, it, allows, more, interpretations, the, picture, can, be, interpreted, as, a, critic, by, klee, who, shows, through, denaturation, of, the, birds, that, the, world, technization, heist, the, creatures, self, determination, other, examples, from, that, period, are, der, goldfisch, the, goldfish, from, 1925, katze, und, vogel, cat, and, bird, from, 1928, and, hauptweg, und, nebenwege, main, road, and, byways, from, 1929, through, variations, of, the, canvas, ground, and, his, combined, painting, techniques, klee, created, new, color, effects, and, picture, impressions, from, 1916, to, 1925, klee, created, 50, hand, puppets, for, his, son, felix, the, puppets, are, not, mentioned, in, the, bauhaus, catalog, of, works, since, they, were, intended, as, private, toys, from, the, beginning, nevertheless, they, are, an, impressive, example, of, klee, s, imagery, he, not, only, dealt, with, puppet, shows, privately, but, also, in, his, artistic, work, at, the, bauhaus, in, 1931, klee, transferred, to, d, sseldorf, to, teach, at, the, akademie, the, nazis, shut, down, the, bauhaus, soon, after, during, this, time, klee, illustrated, a, series, of, guardian, angels, among, these, figurations, is, in, engelshut, in, the, angel, s, care, its, overlaying, technique, evinces, the, polyphonic, character, of, his, drawing, method, between, 1920, and, 1932, the, 1932, painting, ad, parnassum, was, also, created, in, the, d, sseldorf, period, 100, cm, 126, cm, 39, in, 50, in, this, is, one, of, his, largest, paintings, as, he, usually, worked, with, small, formats, in, this, mosaic, like, work, in, the, style, of, pointillism, he, combined, different, techniques, and, compositional, principles, influenced, by, his, trip, to, egypt, from, 1928, to, 1929, klee, built, a, color, field, from, individually, stamped, dots, surrounded, by, similarly, stamped, lines, which, results, in, a, pyramid, above, the, roof, of, the, parnassus, there, is, a, sun, the, title, identifies, the, picture, as, the, home, of, apollo, and, the, muses, during, his, 1929, travels, through, egypt, klee, developed, a, sense, of, connection, to, the, land, described, by, art, historian, olivier, berggruen, as, a, mystical, feeling, in, the, desert, the, sun, s, intense, rays, seemed, to, envelop, all, living, things, and, at, night, the, movement, of, the, stars, felt, even, more, palpable, in, the, architecture, of, the, ancient, funerary, moments, klee, discovered, a, sense, of, proportion, and, measure, in, which, human, beings, appeared, to, establish, a, convincing, relationship, with, the, immensity, of, the, landscape, furthermore, he, was, drawn, to, the, esoteric, numerology, that, governed, the, way, in, which, these, monuments, had, been, built, in, 1933, his, last, year, in, germany, he, created, a, range, of, paintings, and, drawings, the, catalogue, raisonn, comprised, 482, works, the, self, portrait, in, the, same, year, with, the, programmatic, title, von, der, liste, gestrichen, removed, from, the, list, provides, information, about, his, feeling, after, losing, his, professorship, the, abstract, portrait, was, painted, in, dark, colors, and, shows, closed, eyes, and, compressed, lips, while, on, the, back, of, his, head, there, is, a, large, x, symbolizing, that, his, art, was, no, longer, valued, in, germany, in, this, period, klee, mainly, worked, on, large, sized, pictures, after, the, onset, of, illness, there, were, about, 25, works, in, the, 1936, catalogue, but, his, productivity, increased, in, 1937, to, 264, pictures, 1938, to, 489, and, 1939, his, most, productive, year, to, 1254, they, dealt, with, ambivalent, themes, expressing, his, personal, fate, the, political, situation, and, his, wit, examples, are, the, watercolor, painting, musiker, musician, a, stick, man, face, with, partially, serious, partially, smiling, mouth, and, the, revolution, des, viadukts, revolution, of, the, viadukt, an, anti, fascist, art, in, viadukt, 1937, the, bridge, arches, split, from, the, bank, as, they, refuse, to, be, linked, to, a, chain, and, are, therefore, rioting, since, 1938, klee, worked, more, intensively, with, hieroglyphic, like, elements, the, painting, insula, dulcamara, from, the, same, year, which, is, one, of, his, largest, 88, cm, 176, cm, 35, in, 69, in, shows, a, white, face, in, the, middle, of, the, elements, symbolizing, death, with, its, black, circled, eye, sockets, bitterness, and, sorrow, are, not, rare, in, much, of, his, works, during, this, time, klee, created, in, 1940, a, picture, which, strongly, differs, from, the, previous, works, leaving, it, unsigned, on, the, scaffold, the, comparatively, realistic, still, life, ohne, titel, later, named, as, der, todesengel, angel, of, death, depicts, flowers, a, green, pot, sculpture, and, an, angel, the, moon, on, black, ground, is, separated, from, these, groups, during, his, 60th, birthday, klee, was, photographed, in, front, of, this, picture, art, does, not, reproduce, the, visible, rather, it, makes, visible, klee, s, act, is, very, prestigious, in, a, minimum, of, one, line, he, can, reveal, his, wisdom, he, is, everything, profound, gentle, and, many, more, of, the, good, things, and, this, because, he, is, innovative, wrote, oskar, schlemmer, klee, s, future, artist, colleague, at, the, bauhaus, in, his, september, 1916, diary, novelist, and, klee, s, friend, wilhelm, hausenstein, wrote, in, his, work, ber, expressionismus, in, der, malerei, on, expressionism, in, painting, maybe, klee, s, attitude, is, in, general, understandable, for, musical, people, how, klee, is, one, of, the, most, delightsome, violinist, playing, bach, and, h, ndel, who, ever, walked, on, earth, for, klee, the, german, classic, painter, of, the, cubism, the, world, music, became, his, companion, possibly, even, a, part, of, his, art, the, composition, written, in, notes, seems, to, be, not, dissimilar, when, klee, visited, the, paris, surrealism, exhibition, in, 1925, max, ernst, was, impressed, by, his, work, his, partially, morbid, motifs, appealed, to, the, surrealists, andr, breton, helped, to, develop, the, surrealism, and, renamed, klee, s, 1912, painting, zimmerperspektive, mit, einwohnern, room, perspective, with, people, to, chambre, spirit, in, a, catalogue, critic, ren, crevel, called, the, artist, a, dreamer, who, releases, a, swarm, of, small, lyrical, louses, from, mysterious, abysses, paul, klee, s, confidante, will, grohmann, argued, in, the, cahiers, d, art, that, he, stands, definitely, well, solid, on, his, feet, he, is, by, no, means, a, dreamer, he, is, a, modern, person, who, teaches, as, a, professor, at, the, bauhaus, whereupon, breton, as, joan, mir, remembers, was, critical, of, klee, masson, and, i, have, both, discovered, paul, klee, paul, luard, and, crevel, are, also, interested, in, klee, and, they, have, even, visited, him, but, breton, despises, him, the, art, of, mentally, ill, people, inspired, klee, as, well, as, kandinsky, and, max, ernst, after, hans, prinzhorns, book, bildnerei, der, geisteskranken, artistry, of, the, mentally, ill, was, published, in, 1922, in, 1937, some, papers, from, prinzhorn, s, anthology, were, presented, at, the, national, socialist, propaganda, exhibition, entartete, kunst, in, munich, with, the, purpose, of, defaming, the, works, of, kirchner, klee, nolde, and, other, artists, by, likening, them, to, the, works, of, the, insane, in, 1949, marcel, duchamp, commented, on, paul, klee, the, first, reaction, in, front, of, a, klee, painting, is, the, very, pleasant, discovery, what, everyone, of, us, could, or, could, have, done, to, try, drawing, like, in, our, childhood, most, of, his, compositions, show, at, the, first, glance, a, plain, naive, expression, found, in, children, s, drawings, at, a, second, analyse, one, can, discover, a, technique, which, takes, as, a, basis, a, large, maturity, in, thinking, a, deep, understanding, of, dealing, with, watercolors, to, paint, a, personal, method, in, oil, structured, in, decorative, shapes, let, klee, stand, out, in, the, contemporary, art, and, make, him, incomparable, on, the, other, side, his, experiment, was, adopted, in, the, last, 30, years, by, many, other, artists, as, a, basis, for, newer, creations, in, the, most, different, areas, in, painting, his, extreme, productivity, never, shows, evidence, of, repetition, as, is, usually, the, case, he, had, so, much, to, say, that, a, klee, never, became, another, klee, one, of, klee, s, paintings, angelus, novus, was, the, object, of, an, interpretative, text, by, german, philosopher, and, literary, critic, walter, benjamin, who, purchased, the, painting, in, 1921, in, his, theses, on, the, philosophy, of, history, benjamin, suggests, that, the, angel, depicted, in, the, painting, might, be, seen, as, representing, the, angel, of, history, another, aspect, of, his, legacy, and, one, demonstrating, his, multi, faceted, presence, in, the, modern, artistic, imagination, is, his, appeal, for, those, interested, in, the, history, of, the, algorithm, as, exemplified, by, homage, to, paul, klee, by, computer, art, pioneer, frieder, nake, unlike, his, taste, for, adventurous, modern, experiment, in, painting, klee, though, musically, talented, was, attracted, to, older, traditions, of, music, he, appreciated, neither, composers, of, the, late, 19th, century, such, as, wagner, bruckner, and, mahler, nor, contemporary, music, bach, and, mozart, were, for, him, the, greatest, composers, he, most, enjoyed, playing, the, works, by, the, latter, klee, s, work, has, influenced, composers, such, as, argentinian, roberto, garc, a, morillo, in, 1943, with, tres, pinturas, de, paul, klee, others, include, the, american, composer, david, diamond, in, 1958, with, the, four, part, opus, welt, von, paul, klee, world, of, paul, klee, gunther, schuller, composed, seven, studies, on, themes, of,
