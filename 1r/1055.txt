declining, power, of, the, roman, empire, to, extend, his, territory, to, the, south, after, the, death, of, emperor, honorius, and, the, usurpation, of, joannes, in, 423, internal, power, struggles, broke, out, in, the, roman, empire, theodoric, used, this, situation, and, tried, to, capture, the, important, road, junction, arelate, but, the, magister, militum, a, tius, who, was, assisted, by, the, huns, was, able, to, save, the, city, the, visigoths, concluded, a, treaty, and, were, given, gallic, noblemen, as, hostages, the, later, emperor, avitus, visited, theodoric, lived, at, his, court, and, taught, his, sons, because, the, romans, had, to, fight, against, the, franks, who, plundered, cologne, and, trier, in, 435, and, because, of, other, events, theodoric, saw, the, chance, to, conquer, narbo, martius, in, 436, to, obtain, access, to, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, roads, to, the, pyrenees, but, litorius, with, the, aid, of, the, huns, prevented, the, capture, of, the, city, and, drove, the, visigoths, back, to, their, capital, tolosa, theodoric, s, offer, of, peace, was, refused, but, the, king, won, the, decisive, battle, at, tolosa, and, litorius, soon, died, in, gothic, imprisonment, from, his, injuries, avitus, went, according, to, the, orders, of, a, tius, to, tolosa, and, offered, a, peace, treaty, which, theodoric, accepted, perhaps, the, romans, recognized, at, that, time, the, sovereignty, of, the, visigoth, state, a, daughter, of, theodoric, had, been, married, in, 429, to, huneric, a, son, of, the, vandal, ruler, geiseric, but, huneric, later, had, ambitions, to, wed, eudocia, a, daughter, of, the, emperor, valentinian, iii, he, therefore, accused, theodoric, s, daughter, of, planning, to, kill, him, and, in, 444, had, her, mutilated, her, ears, and, nose, cut, off, and, sent, back, to, her, father, which, earned, the, enmity, of, the, visigoths, in, 444, the, former, magister, militum, sebastianus, son, in, law, of, bonifatius, fled, to, tolosa, seeking, refuge, after, exhausting, his, welcome, in, constantinople, where, he, had, been, living, in, exile, since, bonifatius, s, death, this, could, have, strained, relations, with, a, tius, but, theodoric, did, not, permit, sebastianus, to, stay, in, toulouse, sebastianus, then, fled, to, barcelona, where, he, was, also, rebuffed, before, finally, seeking, asylum, in, africa, unfortunately, for, sebastianus, geiseric, seems, to, have, been, no, happier, to, welcome, sebastianus, than, theodoric, and, had, sebastianus, executed, shortly, after, his, arrival, theodoric, was, also, an, enemy, of, the, suevic, king, rechila, in, iberia, because, visigoth, troops, assisted, the, imperial, commander, vitus, in, his, campaign, against, the, suevi, in, 446, but, the, ability, of, this, people, to, conduct, a, strong, defence, and, the, better, relations, between, geiseric, and, the, roman, empire, led, theodoric, to, change, his, foreign, policy, he, therefore, in, february, 449, married, one, of, his, daughters, to, the, new, suevic, king, rechiar, who, visited, his, father, in, law, at, tolosa, in, july, 449, on, his, return, according, to, the, author, isidore, of, seville, rechiar, with, the, assistance, of, visigoth, troops, devastated, the, area, surrounding, the, city, of, caesaraugusta, and, managed, by, guile, to, take, ilerda, some, recent, scholars, doubt, that, theodoric, issued, legislation, as, it, was, assumed, in, earlier, times, when, attila, the, hun, finally, invaded, gaul, avitus, arranged, an, alliance, between, theodoric, and, his, long, standing, enemy, a, tius, against, the, huns, theodoric, joined, this, coalition, because, he, recognized, the, danger, of, the, huns, to, his, own, realm, with, his, whole, army, and, his, sons, thorismund, and, theodoric, he, joined, a, tius, the, visigoth, and, roman, troops, then, saved, the, civitas, aurelianorum, and, forced, attila, to, withdraw, june, 451, then, a, tius, and, theodoric, followed, the, huns, and, fought, against, them, at, the, battle, of, ch, lons, near, troyes, in, about, june, 451, most, visigoths, fought, at, the, right, wing, under, the, command, of, theodoric, but, a, smaller, force, fought, at, the, left, under, the, command, of, thorismund, theodoric, s, forces, contributed, decisively, to, the, victory, of, the, romans, but, he, himself, was, killed, during, the, battle, jordanes, records, two, different, accounts, of, his, death, one, was, that, theodoric, was, thrown, from, his, horse, and, trampled, to, death, the, second, was, that, theodoric, was, slain, by, the, spear, of, the, ostrogoth, andag, who, was, the, father, of, jordanes, s, patron, gunthigis, the, body, of, theodoric, wasn, t, found, until, the, next, day, according, to, gothic, tradition, he, was, mourned, and, buried, by, his, warriors, on, the, battlefield, immediately, thorismund, was, elected, as, successor, of, his, father, after, theodoric, i, s, death, his, sons, ruled, the, visigoths, in, succession, murdering, one, another, by, turns, thorismund, ruled, from, theodoric, s, death, until, 453, when, he, was, murdered, by, his, brother, theodoric, ii, theodoric, ii, ruled, from, 453, until, 466, when, he, was, murdered, by, his, younger, brother, euric, another, brother, frederic, had, died, in, battle, during, theodoric, ii, s, reign, euric, ruled, the, visigoths, from, 466, until, his, death, by, natural, causes, in, 484, theodoric, s, two, other, sons, retimer, and, himnerith, did, not, serve, as, visigothic, kings, after, euric, s, death, power, passed, to, his, son, alaric, ii, according, to, sidonius, apollinaris, who, spent, time, at, theodoric, ii, s, court, theodoric, ii, was, a, grandson, of, alaric, i, the, first, king, of, the, visigoths, this, is, consistent, with, theodoric, ii, s, son, being, called, alaric, ii, as, this, would, make, him, the, great, grandson, of, alaric, i, the, general, consensus, is, that, theodoric, i, s, wife, must, have, been, a, daughter, of, alaric, as, there, are, no, contemporary, accounts, claiming, that, theodoric, himself, was, alaric, s, son, for, his, sacrifice, and, subsequent, victory, over, attila, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, theodoric, became, a, revered, figure, in, western, historiography, and, served, as, an, inspiration, for, j, r, r, tolkien, in, his, creation, of, king, th, oden, of, rohan, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, and, the, battle, of, the, pelennor, fields
