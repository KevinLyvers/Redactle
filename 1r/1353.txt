exercised, a, great, deal, of, influence, over, urrutia, s, regime, which, was, now, ruling, by, decree, he, ensured, that, the, government, implemented, policies, to, cut, corruption, and, fight, illiteracy, and, that, it, attempted, to, remove, batistanos, from, positions, of, power, by, dismissing, congress, and, barring, all, those, elected, in, the, rigged, elections, of, 1954, and, 1958, from, future, office, he, then, pushed, urrutia, to, issue, a, temporary, ban, on, political, parties, he, repeatedly, said, that, they, would, eventually, hold, multiparty, elections, although, repeatedly, denying, that, he, was, a, communist, to, the, press, he, began, clandestinely, meeting, members, of, the, psp, to, discuss, the, creation, of, a, socialist, state, we, are, not, executing, innocent, people, or, political, opponents, we, are, executing, murderers, and, they, deserve, it, castro, s, response, to, his, critics, regarding, the, mass, executions, 1959, in, suppressing, the, revolution, batista, s, government, had, killed, thousands, of, cubans, castro, and, influential, sectors, of, the, press, put, the, death, toll, at, 20, 000, but, a, list, of,

but, instead, sent, vice, president, richard, nixon, whom, castro, instantly, disliked, after, meeting, castro, nixon, described, him, to, eisenhower, the, one, fact, we, can, be, sure, of, is, that, castro, has, those, indefinable, qualities, which, made, him, a, leader, of, men, whatever, we, may, think, of, him, he, is, going, to, be, a, great, factor, in, the, development, of, cuba, and, very, possibly, in, latin, american, affairs, generally, he, seems, to, be, sincere, he, is, either, incredibly, naive, about, communism, or, under, communist, discipline, my, guess, is, the, former, his, ideas, as, to, how, to, run, a, government, or, an, economy, are, less, developed, than, those, of, almost, any, world, figure, i, have, met, in, fifty, countries, but, because, he, has, the, power,

that, cuban, society, could, evolve, straight, to, pure, communism, rather, than, gradually, progress, through, various, stages, of, socialism, in, turn, the, soviet, loyalist, an, bal, escalante,

to, decline, as, large, sectors, of, the, population, felt, little, incentive, to, work, hard, this, was, exacerbated, by, the, perception, that, a, revolutionary, elite, had, emerged, consisting, of, those, connected, to, the, administration, they, had, access, to, better, housing, private, transportation, servants, and, the, ability, to, purchase, luxury, goods, abroad, castro, publicly,

relations, with, israel, citing, its, government, s, close, relationship, with, the, us, and, its, treatment, of, palestinians, during, the, israel, palestine, conflict, this, earned, castro, respect, throughout, the, arab, world, in, particular, from, the, libyan, leader, muammar, gaddafi, who, became, a, friend, and, ally, as, the, yom, kippur, war, broke, out, in, october, 1973, between, israel,

castro, considered, africa, to, be, the, weakest, link, in, the, imperialist, chain, and, at, the, request, of, agostinho, neto, he, ordered, 230, military, advisers, into, angola, in, november, 1975, to, aid, neto, s, marxist, mpla, in, the, angolan, civil, war, when, the, us, and, south, africa, stepped, up, their, support, of, the, opposition, flna, and, unita, castro, ordered, a, further, 18, 000, troops, to, angola, which, played, a, major, role, in, forcing, a, south, african, and, unita, retreat, the, decision, to, intervene, in, angola, has, been, a, controversial, one, all, the, more, so, as, castro, s, critics, have, charged, that, it, was, not, his, decision, at, all, contending, that, the, soviets, ordered, him, to, do, so, castro, always, maintained, that, he, took, the, decision, to, launch, operation, carlota, himself, in, response, to, an, appeal, from, neto, and, that, the, soviets, were, in, fact, opposed, to, cuban, intervention, in, angola, which, took, place,

assembly, 1979, in, 1977, the, ogaden, war, broke, out, over, the, disputed, ogaden, region, as, somalia, invaded, ethiopia, although, a, former, ally, of, somali, president, siad, barre, castro, had, warned, him, against, such, action, and, cuba, sided, with, mengistu, haile, mariam, s, marxist, government, of, ethiopia, in, a, desperate, attempt, to, stop, the, war, castro, had, a, summit, with, barre, where, he, proposed, a, federation, of, ethiopia, somalia, and, south, yemen, as, an, alternative, to, war, barre, who, saw, seizing, the, ogaden, as, the, first, step, towards, creating, a, greater, somalia, that, would, unite, all, of, the, somalis, into, one, state, rejected, the, federation, offer, and, decided, upon, war, castro, sent, troops, under, the, command, of, general, arnaldo, ochoa, to, aid, the, overwhelmed, ethiopian, army, mengistu, s, regime, was, barely, hanging, on, by, 1977, having, lost, one, third, of, its, army, in, eritrea, at, the, time, of, the, somali, invasion, the, intervention, of, 17, 000, cuban, troops, into, the, ogaden, was, by, all, accounts, decisive, in, altering, a, war, that, ethiopia, was, on, the, brink, of, losing, into, a, victory, after, forcing, back, the, somalis, mengistu, then, ordered, the, ethiopians, to, suppress, the, eritrean, people, s, liberation, front, a, measure, castro, refused, to, support, castro, extended, support, to, latin, american, revolutionary, movements, namely, the, sandinista, national, liberation, front, in, its, overthrow, of, the, nicaraguan, rightist, government, of, anastasio, somoza, debayle, in, july, 1979, castro, s, critics, accused, the, government, of, wasting, cuban, lives, in, these, military, endeavours, the, anti, castro, center, for, a, free, cuba, has, claimed, that, an, estimated, 14, 000, cubans, were, killed, in, foreign, cuban, military, actions, when, american, critics, claimed, that, castro, had, no, right, to, interfere, in, these, nations, he, countered, that, cuba, had, been, invited, into, them, pointing, out, the, us, s, own, involvement, in, various, foreign, nations, between, 1979, and, 1991, about, 370, 000, cuban, troops, together, with, 50, 000, cuban, civilians, mostly, teachers, and, doctors, served, in, angola, representing, about, 5, of, cuba, s, population, the, cuban, intervention, in, angola, was, envisioned, as, a, short, term, commitment, but, the, angolan, government, used, the, profits, from, the, oil, industry, to, subsidize, cuba, s, economy, making, cuba, as, economically, dependent, upon, angola, as, angola, was, militarily, dependent, upon, cuba, in, the, late, 1970s, cuba, s, relations, with, north, american, states, improved, during, the, period, with, mexican, president, luis, echeverr, a, canadian, prime, minister, pierre, trudeau, and, us, president, jimmy, carter, in, power, carter, continued, criticizing, cuba, s, human, rights, abuses, but, adopted, a, respectful, approach, which, gained, castro, s, attention, considering, carter, well, meaning, and, sincere, castro, freed, certain, political, prisoners, and, allowed, some, cuban, exiles, to, visit, relatives, on, the, island, hoping, that, in, turn, carter, would, abolish, the, economic, embargo, and, stop, cia, support, for, militant, dissidents, conversely, his, relationship, with, china, declined, as, he, accused, deng, xiaoping, s, chinese, government, of, betraying, their, revolutionary, principles, by, initiating, trade, links, with, the, us, and, attacking, vietnam, in, 1979, the, conference, of, the, non, aligned, movement, nam, was, held, in, havana, where, castro, was, selected, as, nam, president, a, position, he, held, until, 1982, in, his, capacity, as, both, president, of, the, nam, and, of, cuba, he, appeared, at, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, october, 1979, and, gave, a, speech, on, the, disparity, between, the, world, s, rich, and, poor, his, speech, was, greeted, with, much, applause, from, other, world, leaders, though, his, standing, in, nam, was, damaged, by, cuba, s, refusal, to, condemn, the, soviet, intervention, in, afghanistan, by, the, 1980s, cuba, s, economy, was, again, in, trouble, following, a, decline, in, the, market, price, of, sugar, and, 1979, s, decimated, harvest, for, the, first, time, unemployment, became, a, serious, problem, in, castro, s, cuba, with, the, government, sending, unemployed, youth, to, other, countries, primarily, east, germany, to, work, there, desperate, for, money, cuba, s, government, secretly, sold, off, paintings, from, national, collections, and, illicitly, traded, for, us, electronic, goods, through, panama, increasing, numbers, of, cubans, fled, to, florida, but, were, labelled, scum, and, lumpen, by, castro, and, his, cdr, supporters, in, one, incident, 10, 000, cubans, stormed, the, peruvian, embassy, requesting, asylum, and, so, the, us, agreed, that, it, would, accept, 3, 500, refugees, castro, conceded, that, those, who, wanted, to, leave, could, do, so, from, mariel, port, in, what, was, known, as, the, mariel, boatlift, hundreds, of, boats, arrived, from, the, us, leading, to, a, mass, exodus, of, 120, 000, castro, s, government, took, advantage, of, the, situation, by, loading, criminals, the, mentally, ill, and, homosexuals, onto, the, boats, destined, for, florida, the, event, destabilized, carter, s, administration, and, later, in, 1980, ronald, reagan, was, elected, us, president, reagan, s, administration, adopted, a, hard, line, approach, against, castro, making, its, desire, to, overthrow, his, regime, clear, in, late, 1981, castro, publicly, accused, the, us, of, biological, warfare, against, cuba, by, orchestrating, a, dengue, fever, epidemic, cuba, s, economy, became, even, more, dependent, on, soviet, aid, with, soviet, subsidies, mainly, in, the, form, of, supplies, of, low, cost, oil, and, voluntarily, buying, cuban, sugar, at, inflated, prices, averaging, 4, 5, billion, a, year, by, the, late, 1980s, this, accounted, for, 30, 38, of, the, country, s, entire, gdp, soviet, economic, assistance, had, not, helped, cuba, s, long, term, growth, prospects, by, promoting, diversification, or, sustainability, although, described, as, a, relatively, highly, developed, latin, american, export, economy, in, 1959, and, the, early, 1960s, cuba, s, basic, economic, structure, changed, very, little, between, then, and, the, 1980s, tobacco, products, such, as, cigars, and, cigarettes, were, the, only, manufactured, products, among, cuba, s, leading, exports, and, were, produced, using, an, expensive, and, labor, intensive, pre, industrial, process, the, cuban, economy, remained, highly, inefficient, and, over, specialized, in, a, few, highly, subsidized, commodities, exported, primarily, to, the, soviet, bloc, countries, although, despising, argentina, s, right, wing, military, junta, castro, supported, them, in, the, 1982, falklands, war, against, britain, and, offered, military, aid, to, the, argentinians, castro, supported, the, leftist, new, jewel, movement, that, seized, power, in, grenada, in, 1979, befriending, grenadine, president, maurice, bishop, and, sending, doctors, teachers, and, technicians, to, aid, the, country, s, development, when, bishop, was, executed, in, a, soviet, backed, coup, by, hard, line, marxist, bernard, coard, in, october, 1983, castro, condemned, the, killing, but, cautiously, retained, support, for, grenada, s, government, however, the, us, used, the, coup, as, a, basis, for, invading, the, island, cuban, soldiers, died, in, the, conflict, with, castro, denouncing, the, invasion, and, comparing, the, us, to, nazi, germany, in, a, july, 1983, speech, marking, the, 30th, anniversary, of, the, cuban, revolution, castro, condemned, reagan, s, administration, as, a, reactionary, extremist, clique, who, were, waging, an, openly, warmongering, and, fascist, foreign, policy, castro, feared, a, us, invasion, of, nicaragua, and, sent, ochoa, to, train, the, governing, sandinistas, in, guerrilla, warfare, but, received, little, support, from, the, ussr, in, 1985, mikhail, gorbachev, became, secretary, general, of, the, soviet, communist, party, a, reformer, he, implemented, measures, to, increase, freedom, of, the, press, glasnost, and, economic, decentralization, perestroika, in, an, attempt, to, strengthen, socialism, like, many, orthodox, marxist, critics, castro, feared, that, the, reforms, would, weaken, the, socialist, state, and, allow,

october, 1985, castro, gave, up, regularly, smoking, cuban, cigars, helping, to, set, an, example, for, the, rest, of, the, populace, castro, became, passionate, in, his, denunciation, of, the, third, world, debt, problem, arguing, that, the, third, world, would, never, escape, the, debt, that, first, world, banks, and, governments, imposed, upon, it, in, 1985, havana, hosted, five, international, conferences, on, the, world, debt, problem, by, november, 1987, castro, began, spending, more, time, on, the, angolan, civil, war, in, which, the, marxist, mpla, government, had, fallen, into, retreat, angolan, president, jos, eduardo, dos, santos, successfully, appealed, for, more, cuban, troops, with, castro, later, admitting, that, he, devoted, more, time, to, angola, than, to, the, domestic, situation, believing, that, a, victory, would, lead, to, the, collapse, of, apartheid, in, response, to, the, siege, of, cuito, cuanavale, in, 1987, 1988, by, south, african, unita, forces, castro, sent, an, additional, 12, 000, cuban, army, troops, to, angola, in, late, 1987, from, afar, in, havana, castro, was, closely, involved, in, the, decision, making, about, the, defence, of, cuito, cuanavle, and, came, into, conflict, with, ochoa, whom, he, criticized, for, almost, losing, cuito, cuanavle, to, a, south, african, unita, assault, on, 13, january, 1988, despite, warning, for, almost, two, months, prior, that, such, an, attack, was, coming, on, 30, january, 1988, ochoa, was, summoned, to, a, meeting, with, castro, in, havana, where, he, was, told, that, cuito, cuanavale, must, not, fall, and, to, execute, castro, s, plans, for, a, pull, back, to, more, defensible, positions, over, the, objections, of, the, angolans, the, cuban, troops, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, relief, of, cuito, cuanavale, breaking, the, siege, in, march, 1988, which, led, to, the, withdrawal, of, most, of, the, south, african, troops, from, angola, cuban, propaganda, turned, the, siege, of, cuito, cuanavle, into, a, decisive, victory, that, changed, the, course, of, african, history, and, castro, awarded, 82, soldiers, medals, of, the, newly, created, medal, of, merit, for, the, defense, of, cuito, cuanavle, on, 1, april, 1988, tensions, were, increased, with, the, cubans, advancing, close, to, the, border, of, namibia, which, led, to, warnings, from, the, south, african, government, that, they, considered, this, an, extremely, unfriendly, act, causing, south, africa, to, mobilize, and, call, up, its, reserves, in, the, spring, of, 1988, the, intensity, of, south, african, cuban, fighting, drastically, increased, with, both, sides, taking, heavy, losses, the, prospect, of, an, all, out, cuban, south, african, war, served, to, concentrate, minds, in, both, moscow, and, washington, and, led, to, an, increased, push, for, a, diplomatic, solution, to, the, angolan, war, the, cost, of, cuba, s, wars, in, africa, were, paid, for, with, soviet, subsidies, at, a, time, when, the, soviet, economy, was, badly, hurt, by, low, oil, prices, while, the, apartheid, government, of, south, africa, had, by, the, 1980s, become, a, very, awkward, american, ally, as, much, of, the, american, population, especially, black, americans, objected, to, apartheid, from, the, viewpoint, of, both, moscow, and, washington, having, both, cuba, and, south, africa, disengage, in, angola, was, the, best, possible, outcome, the, low, oil, prices, of, the, 1980s, had, also, changed, the, angolan, attitude, about, subsidizing, the, cuban, economy, as, dos, santos, found, the, promises, made, in, the, 1970s, when, oil, prices, were, high, to, be, a, serious, drain, upon, angola, s, economy, in, the, 1980s, south, african, whites, were, vastly, outnumbered, by, south, african, blacks, and, accordingly, the, south, african, army, could, not, take, heavy, losses, with, its, white, troops, as, that, would, fatally, weaken, the, ability, of, the, south, african, state, to, uphold, apartheid, the, cubans, had, also, taken, heavy, losses, while, the, increasing, difficult, relations, with, dos, santos, who, become, less, generous, in, subsidizing, the, cuban, economy, suggested, that, such, losses, were, not, worth, the, cost, gorbachev, called, for, a, negotiated, end, to, the, conflict, and, in, 1988, organized, a, quadripartite, talk, between, the, ussr, us, cuba, and, south, africa, they, agreed, that, all, foreign, troops, would, pull, out, of, angola, while, south, africa, agreed, to, grant, independence, to, namibia, castro, was, angered, by, gorbachev, s, approach, believing, that, he, was, abandoning, the, plight, of, the, world, s, poor, in, favour, of, d, tente, when, gorbachev, visited, cuba, in, april, 1989, he, informed, castro, that, perestroika, meant, an, end, to, subsidies, for, cuba, ignoring, calls, for, liberalization, in, accordance, with, the, soviet, example, castro, continued, to, clamp, down, on, internal, dissidents, and, in, particular, kept, tabs, on, the, military, the, primary, threat, to, the, government, a, number, of, senior, military, officers, including, ochoa, and, tony, de, la,

economy, had, declined, by, over, 40, in, under, two, years, with, major, food, shortages, widespread, malnutrition, and, a, lack, of, basic, goods, castro, hoped, for, a, restoration, of, marxism, leninism, in, the, ussr, but, refrained, from, backing, the, 1991, coup, in, that, country, when, gorbachev, regained, control, cuba, soviet, relations, deteriorated, further, and, soviet, troops,

not, meet, the, marxist, assumption, that, socialism, would, be, achieved, through, proletariat, revolution, for, most, of, the, forces, involved, in, batista, s, overthrow, were, led, by, members, of, the, cuban, middle, class, according, to, castro, a, country, could, be, regarded, as, socialist, if, its, means, of, production, were, controlled, by, the, state, in, this, way, his, understanding, of, socialism, was, less, about, who, controlled, power, in, a, country, and, more, about, the, method, of, distribution, castro, s, government, was, also, nationalistic, with, castro, declaring, we, are, not, only, marxist, leninists, but, also, nationalists, and, patriots, in, this, it, drew, upon, a, longstanding, tradition, of, cuban, nationalism, castro, biographer, sebastian, balfour, noted, that, the, vein, of, moral, regeneration, and, voluntarism, that, runs, through, castro, s, thought, owes, far, more, to, hispanic, nationalism, than, european, socialism, or, marxism, leninism, historian, richard, gott, remarked, that, one, of, the, keys, to, castro, s, success, was, his, ability, to, use, the, twin, themes, of, socialism, and, nationalism, and, keep, them, endlessly, in, play, castro, described, karl, marx, and, cuban, nationalist, jos, mart, as, his, main, political, influences, although, gott, believed, that, mart, ultimately, remained, more, important, than, marx, in, castro, s, politics, castro, described, mart, s, political, ideas, as, a, philosophy, of, independence, and, an, exceptional, humanistic, philosophy, and, his, supporters, and, apologists, repeatedly, claimed, that, there, were, great, similarities, between, the, two, figures, biographer, volker, skierka, described, castro, s, government, as, a, highly, individual, socialist, nationalist, fidelista, system, with, theodore, draper, terming, his, approach, castroism, viewing, it, as, a, blend, of, european, socialism, with, the, latin, american, revolutionary, tradition, political, scientist, paul, c, sondrol, has, described, castro, s, approach, to, politics, as, totalitarian, utopianism, with, a, style, of, leadership, that, drew, upon, the, wider, latin, american, phenomenon, of, the, caudillo, he, drew, inspiration, from, the, wider, latin, american, anti, imperialist, movements, of, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, including, argentina, s, per, n, and, guatemala, s, jacobo, rbenz, castro, took, a, relatively, socially, conservative, stance, on, many, issues, opposing, drug, use, gambling, and, prostitution, which, he, viewed, as, moral, evils, instead, he, advocated, hard, work, family, values, integrity, and, self, discipline, although, his, government, repressed, homosexual, activity, for, decades, later, in, his, life, he, took, responsibility, for, this, persecution, regretting, it, as, a, great, injustice, as, he, himself, put, it, juan, reynaldo, s, nchez, castro, s, former, bodyguard, detailed, much, of, his, personal, and, private, life, in, his, book, the, double, life, of, fidel, castro, he, described, castro, as, nothing, ordinary, about, him, at, all, he, is, unique, special, and, different, he, profiled, him, as, an, egocentric, who, loved, being, the, center, of, attention, and, with, his, almost, electric, charisma, grabbed, the, attention, of, the, people, around, him, he, was, also, highly, manipulative, with, his, formidable, intelligence, he, could, easily, manipulate, a, person, or, group, of, people, in, addition, he, was, repetitive, and, obsessive, in, discussions, with, his, colleagues, or, foreigners, he, would, repeat, the, same, things, repeatedly, until, they, were, convinced, he, was, right, it, was, impossible, to, contradict, him, on, any, subject, whatsoever, anyone, who, attempted, to, convince, him, that, he, was, wrong, or, even, made, a, suggestion, that, it, could, be, improved, slightly, was, making, a, fatal, error, fidel, would, then, make, a, mental, mark, of, the, individual, as, an, idiot, and, wait, for, the, right, time, to, retaliate, against, them, nobody, not, even, ra, l, was, exempt, from, this, despite, being, the, minister, of, the, armed, forces, he, would, bring, seemingly, minor, military, decisions, to, castro, for, his, final, approval, to, avoid, inadvertently, contradicting, him, s, nchez, believed, that, general, arnaldo, ochoa, s, downfall, was, significantly, related, to, his, willingness, to, contradict, fidel, s, orders, in, angola, biographer, leycester, coltman, described, castro, as, fiercely, hard, working, dedicated, loyal, generous, and, magnanimous, but, noted, that, he, could, be, vindictive, and, unforgiving, he, asserted, that, castro, always, had, a, keen, sense, of, humor, and, could, laugh, at, himself, but, could, equally, be, a, bad, loser, who, would, act, with, ferocious, rage, if, he, thought, that, he, was, being, humiliated, publicly, he, was, known, for, throwing, tantrums, and, could, make, snap, judgments, which, he, refused, to, back, down, from, in, private, though, castro, was, skilled, at, keeping, his, anger, in, check, and, not, allowing, it, to, affect, his, judgment, simply, becoming, cold, and, withdrawn, s, nchez, stated, that, in, 17, years, he, had, only, seen, castro, explode, in, anger, twice, one, upon, being, informed, of, his, daughter, alina, s, defection, in, 1993, castro, was, known, for, working, long, hours, he, primarily, woke, up, late, rarely, before, ten, or, eleven, in, the, morning, and, started, his, working, day, around, noon, and, would, work, until, late, at, night, often, only, going, to, bed, at, 3, or, 4, am, he, preferred, to, meet, foreign, diplomats, in, these, early, hours, believing, that, they, would, be, tired, and, he, could, gain, the, upper, hand, in, negotiations, castro, liked, to, meet, with, ordinary, citizens, both, in, cuba, and, abroad, but, took, a, particularly, paternal, attitude, toward, cubans, treating, them, as, if, they, were, a, part, of, his, own, giant, family, british, historian, alex, von, tunzelmann, commented, that, though, ruthless, was, a, patriot, a, man, with, a, profound, sense, that, it, was, his, mission, to, save, the, cuban, people, political, scientist, paul, c, sondrol, characterized, castro, as, quintessentially, totalitarian, in, his, charismatic, appeal, utopian, functional, role, and, public, transformative, utilisation, of, power, balfour, described, castro, as, having, a, voracity, for, knowledge, and, elephantine, memory, that, allowed, him, to, speak, for, hours, on, various, subjects, his, hero, was, alexander, the, great, whose, spanish, equivalent, alejandro, he, adopted, as, his, nom, de, guerre, castro, was, a, voracious, reader, amongst, his, favorite, authors, were, ernest, hemingway, franz, kafka, william, shakespeare, and, maxim, gorky, he, named, for, whom, the, bell, tolls, his, favorite, book, committing, several, portions, of, the, novel, to, memory, and, using, some, of, its, lessons, as, a, guerrilla, fighter, he, enjoyed, art, and, photography, and, was, known, as, a, patron, of, both, within, cuba, but, was, uninterested, in, music, and, disliked, dancing, he, was, also, an, avid, fan, of, cinema, particularly, soviet, films, his, favorite, film, was, the, five, hour, long, 1967, adaption, of, leo, tolstoy, s, war, and, peace, castro, had, a, lifelong, passion, almost, obsession, with, cows, and, starting, in, 1966, with, bovine, genetics, and, breeding, state, media, frequently, published, details, of, his, attempts, to, breed, cows, with, increased, milk, yields, this, interest, reached, its, peak, in, 1982, when, a, cow, that, fidel, had, bred, ubre, blanca, broke, the, guinness, world, record, for, producing, 29, gallons, of, milk, live, on, national, television, she, was, promoted, into, a, national, celebrity, and, propaganda, tool, and, when, the, cow, died, in, 1985, granma, published, an, official, obituary, for, her, on, the, front, page, and, the, postal, service, issued, stamps, in, her, honor, fidel, castro, s, religious, beliefs, have, been, a, matter, of, some, debate, he, was, baptized, and, raised, as, a, roman, catholic, he, criticized, the, use, of, the, bible, to, justify, the, oppression, of, women, and, africans, but, commented, that, christianity, exhibited, a, group, of, very, humane, precepts, which, gave, the, world, ethical, values, and, a, sense, of, social, justice, relating, if, people, call, me, christian, not, from, the, standpoint, of, religion, but, from, the, standpoint, of, social, vision, i, declare, that, i, am, a, christian, during, a, visit, of, american, minister, and, activist, jesse, jackson, castro, accompanied, him, to, a, methodist, church, service, where, he, even, spoke, from, the, pulpit, with, a, bible, before, him, an, event, that, marked, a, beginning, of, increased, openness, towards, christianity, in, cuba, he, promoted, the, idea, that, jesus, christ, was, a, communist, citing, the, feeding, of, the, 5, 000, and, the, story, of, jesus, and, the, rich, young, man, as, evidence, within, cuba, castro, was, primarily, referred, to, by, his, official, military, title, comandante, en, jefe, he, was, usually, addressed, as, comandante, the, commander, in, general, discourse, as, well, as, in, person, but, could, also, be, addressed, as, el, jefe, the, chief, in, the, third, person, particularly, within, the, party, and, military, command, castro, was, often, nicknamed, el, caballo, the, horse, a, label, attributed, to, cuban, entertainer, benny, mor, which, alludes, to, castro, s, well, known, philandering, during, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, with, his, logorrheic, oratorical, abilities, and, profound, charisma, castro, was, highly, skilled, at, manipulation, and, deception, quickly, whipping, up, his, audience, and, entire, population, segments, into, support, large, throngs, of, supporters, gathered, to, cheer, at, castro, s, fiery, speeches, which, typically, lasted, for, hours, even, outdoors, in, inclement, weather, and, without, the, use, of, written, notes, during, speeches, castro, regularly, cited, reports, and, books, he, had, read, on, various, subjects, including, military, matters, plant, cultivation, filmmaking, and, chess, strategies, officially, the, cuban, government, did, maintain, a, cult, of, personality, however, unlike, other, soviet, era, leaders, and, his, allies, it, was, less, widespread, and, took, on, a, more, subtle, and, discreet, form, there, were, no, statues, or, large, portraits, of, him, but, rather, signs, with, thoughts, of, the, comandante, his, popularity, among, segments, of, the, cuban, populace, led, to, one, development, without, the, government, s, involvement, it, would, be, used, to, judge, each, individual, s, devotion, to, his, revolutionary, cause, indeed, by, 2006, castro, s, image, could, frequently, be, found, in, cuban, stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and, on, national, television, in, private, however, castro, hated, such, idolization, campaigns, and, believed, that, he, had, intellectual, ascendancy, over, leaders, who, engaged, in, such, behavior, such, as, his, friend, kim, il, sung, of, north, korea, whose, cult, of, personality, he, considered, excessive, outlandish, and, unreasonable, he, gave, no, importance, to, his, appearance, or, clothing, for, 37, years, he, wore, only, his, trademark, olive, green, military, fatigues, or, the, standard, minfar, dress, uniform, for, formal, events, and, special, occasions, emphasizing, his, role, as, the, perpetual, revolutionary, but, in, the, mid, 1990s, began,

foreign, leaders, he, met, with, giving, him, a, dominating, presence, in, any, room, or, photo, that, was, taken, which, he, used, to, his, advantage, for, comparison, abraham, lincoln, and, charles, de, gaulle, both, well, known, for, their, tall, heights, stood, at, 6, 4, and, 6, 5, respectively, until, his, uprising, against, batista, castro, typically, kept, a, pencil, thin, mustache, and, combed, back, hair, typical, of, upper, class, cuban, men, in, the, 1950s, but, grew, out, both, during, his, years, as, a, guerrilla, fighter, and, retained, them, afterward, castro, also, disliked, worrying, about, his, appearance, and, hated, shaving, making, the, beard, and, uniform, all, the, more, convenient, for, him, his, uniform, was, also, kept, simple, he, never, wore, any, medals, or, decorations, and, his, only, marker, of, rank, was, the, comandante, el, jefe, insignia, stitched, on, the, shoulder, straps, until, the, 1990s, he, wore, combat, boots, but, he, abandoned, them, for, sneakers, and, tennis, shoes, instead, due, to, orthopedic, issues, around, his, waist, he, often, carried, a, 9mm, browning, pistol, in, a, brown, leather, holster, with, three, additional, magazines, his, weapon, of, choice, was, a, 7, 62, kalashnikov, akm, which, castro, occasionally, carried, with, him, during, the, 1960s, but, was, later, kept, stored, in, a, suitcase, carried, by, one, of, the, members, of, his, escort, or, kept, placed, between, his, feet, while, driving, along, with, five, cartridges, he, frequently, used, it, during, shooting, exercises, and, practice, castro, had, a, lifelong, love, of, guns, and, was, considered, an, expert, sharpshooter, impressing, foreign, visitors, and, even, holding, up, against, members, of, his, elite, bodyguards, who, engaged, in, frequent, competition, with, him, castro, s, most, iconic, public, feature, eventually, became, the, cuban, cigar, he, smoked, daily, introduced, to, it, by, his, father, at, the, age, of, 15, castro, continued, the, habit, for, almost, 44, years, except, for, a, brief, period, during, the, 1950s, while, he, was, a, guerrilla, fighter, and, boycotting, against, batista, linked,
