john, logie, baird, frse, l, o, i, b, r, d, 13, august, 1888, 14, june, 1946, was, a, scottish, inventor, electrical, engineer, and, innovator, who, demonstrated, the, world, s, first, live, working, television, system, on, 26, january, 1926, he, went, on, to, invent, the, first, publicly, demonstrated, colour, television, system, and, the, first, viable, purely, electronic, colour, television, picture, tube, in, 1928, the, baird, television, development, company, achieved, the, first, transatlantic, television, transmission, baird, s, early, technological, successes, and, his, role, in, the, practical, introduction, of, broadcast, television, for, home, entertainment, have, earned, him, a, prominent, place, in, television, s, history, in, 2006, baird, was, named, as, one, of, the, 10, greatest, scottish, scientists, in, history, having, been, listed, in, the, national, library, of, scotland, s, scottish, science, hall, of, fame, in, 2015, he, was, inducted, into, the, scottish, engineering, hall, of, fame, in, 2017, ieee, unveiled, a, bronze, street, plaque, at, 22, frith, street, bar, italia, london, dedicated, to, baird, and, the, invention, of, television, in, 2021, the, royal, mint, unveiled, a, john, logie, baird, 50p, coin, commemorating, the, 75th, anniversary, of, his, death, baird, was, born, on, 13, august, 1888, in, helensburgh, dunbartonshire, and, was, the, youngest, of, four, children, of, the, reverend, john, baird, the, church, of, scotland, s, minister, for, the, local, st, bride, s, church, and, jessie, morrison, inglis, the, orphaned, niece, of, the, wealthy, inglis, family, of, shipbuilders, from, glasgow, he, was, educated, at, larchfield, academy, now, part, of, lomond, school, in, helensburgh, the, glasgow, and, west, of, scotland, technical, college, and, the, university, of, glasgow, while, at, college, baird, undertook, a, series, of, engineering, apprentice, jobs, as, part, of, his, course, the, conditions, in, industrial, glasgow, at, the, time, helped, form, his, socialist, convictions, but, also, contributed, to, his, ill, health, he, became, an, agnostic, though, this, did, not, strain, his, relationship, with, his, father, his, degree, course, was, interrupted, by, the, first, world, war, and, he, never, returned, to, graduate, at, the, beginning, of, 1915, he, volunteered, for, service, in, the, british, army, but, was, classified, as, unfit, for, active, duty, unable, to, go, to, the, front, he, took, a, job, with, the, clyde, valley, electrical, power, company, which, was, engaged, in, munitions, work, in, early, 1923, and, in, poor, health, baird, moved, to, 21, linton, crescent, hastings, on, the, south, coast, of, england, he, later, rented, a, workshop, in, the, queen, s, arcade, in, the, town, baird, built, what, was, to, become, the, world, s, first, working, television, set, using, items, that, included, an, old, hatbox, and, a, pair, of, scissors, some, darning, needles, a, few, bicycle, light, lenses, a, used, tea, chest, and, sealing, wax, and, glue, that, he, purchased, in, february, 1924, he, demonstrated, to, the, radio, times, that, a, semi, mechanical, analogue, television, system, was, possible, by, transmitting, moving, silhouette, images, in, july, of, the, same, year, he, received, a, 1000, volt, electric, shock, but, survived, with, only, a, burnt, hand, but, as, a, result, his, landlord, mr, tree, asked, him, to, vacate, the, premises, soon, after, arriving, in, london, looking, for, publicity, baird, visited, the, daily, express, newspaper, to, promote, his, invention, the, news, editor, was, terrified, and, he, was, quoted, by, one, of, his, staff, as, saying, for, god, s, sake, go, down, to, reception, and, get, rid, of, a, lunatic, who, s, down, there, he, says, he, s, got, a, machine, for, seeing, by, wireless, watch, him, he, may, have, a, razor, on, him, in, these, attempts, to, develop, a, working, television, system, baird, experimented, using, the, nipkow, disk, paul, gottlieb, nipkow, had, invented, this, scanning, system, in, 1884, television, historian, albert, abramson, calls, nipkow, s, patent, the, master, television, patent, nipkow, s, work, is, important, because, baird, followed, by, many, others, chose, to, develop, it, into, a, broadcast, medium, in, his, laboratory, on, 2, october, 1925, baird, successfully, transmitted, the, first, television, picture, with, a, greyscale, image, the, head, of, a, ventriloquist, s, dummy, nicknamed, stooky, bill, in, a, 32, line, vertically, scanned, image, at, five, pictures, per, second, baird, went, downstairs, and, fetched, an, office, worker, 20, year, old, william, edward, taynton, to, see, what, a, human, face, would, look, like, and, taynton, became, the, first, person, to, be, televised, in, a, full, tonal, range, in, june, 1924, baird, had, bought, from, cyril, frank, elwell, a, thallium, sulphide, thalofide, cell, developed, by, theodore, case, in, the, usa, the, thalofide, cell, was, part, of, the, important, new, technology, of, talking, pictures, baird, s, pioneering, implementation, of, this, cell, allowed, baird, to, become, the, first, person, to, produce, a, live, moving, greyscale, television, image, from, reflected, light, baird, achieved, this, where, other, inventors, had, failed, by, applying, two, unique, methods, to, the, case, cell, he, accomplished, this, by, improving, the, signal, conditioning, from, the, cell, through, temperature, optimisation, cooling, and, his, own, custom, designed, video, amplifier, baird, gave, the, first, public, demonstration, of, moving, silhouette, images, by, television, at, selfridges, department, store, in, london, in, a, three, week, series, of, demonstrations, beginning, on, 25, march, 1925, on, 26, january, 1926, baird, gave, the, first, public, demonstration, of, true, television, images, for, members, of, the, royal, institution, and, a, reporter, from, the, times, in, his, laboratory, at, 22, frith, street, in, the, soho, district, of, london, where, bar, italia, is, now, located, baird, initially, used, a, scan, rate, of, 5, pictures, per, second, improving, this, to, 12, 5, pictures, per, second, c, 1927, it, was, the, first, demonstration, of, a, television, system, that, could, scan, and, display, live, moving, images, with, tonal, graduation, he, demonstrated, the, world, s, first, colour, transmission, on, 3, july, 1928, using, scanning, discs, at, the, transmitting, and, receiving, ends, with, three, spirals, of, apertures, each, spiral, with, a, filter, of, a, different, primary, colour, and, three, light, sources, at, the, receiving, end, with, a, commutator, to, alternate, their, illumination, that, same, year, he, also, demonstrated, stereoscopic, television, in, 1927, baird, transmitted, a, long, distance, television, signal, over, 438, miles, 705, km, of, telephone, line, between, london, and, glasgow, baird, transmitted, the, world, s, first, long, distance, television, pictures, to, the, central, hotel, at, glasgow, central, station, this, transmission, was, baird, s, response, to, a, 225, mile, long, distance, telecast, between, stations, of, at, t, bell, labs, the, bell, stations, were, in, new, york, and, washington, dc, the, earlier, telecast, took, place, in, april, 1927, a, month, before, baird, s, demonstration, baird, set, up, the, baird, television, development, company, ltd, which, in, 1928, made, the, first, transatlantic, television, transmission, from, london, to, hartsdale, new, york, and, in, 1929, the, first, television, programmes, officially, transmitted, by, the, bbc, in, november, 1929, baird, and, bernard, natan, established, france, s, first, television, company, t, l, vision, baird, natan, broadcast, on, the, bbc, on, 14, july, 1930, the, man, with, the, flower, in, his, mouth, was, the, first, drama, shown, on, uk, television, the, bbc, transmitted, baird, s, first, live, outside, broadcast, with, the, televising, of, the, derby, in, 1931, he, demonstrated, a, theatre, television, system, with, a, screen, two, feet, by, five, feet, 60, cm, by, 150, cm, in, 1930, at, the, london, coliseum, berlin, paris, and, stockholm, by, 1939, he, had, improved, his, theatre, projection, to, televise, a, boxing, match, on, a, screen, 15, ft, 4, 6, m, by, 12, ft, 3, 7, m, from, 1929, to, 1935, the, bbc, transmitters, were, used, to, broadcast, television, programmes, using, the, 30, line, baird, system, and, from, 1932, to, 1935, the, bbc, also, produced, the, programmes, in, their, own, studio, first, at, broadcasting, house, and, then, later, at, 16, portland, place, in, addition, from, 1933, baird, and, the, baird, company, were, producing, and, broadcasting, a, small, number, of, television, programmes, independent, of, the, bbc, from, baird, s, studios, and, transmitter, at, the, crystal, palace, in, south, london, on, 2, november, 1936, from, alexandra, palace, located, on, the, high, ground, of, the, north, london, ridge, the, bbc, began, alternating, baird, 240, line, transmissions, with, emi, s, electronic, scanning, system, which, had, recently, been, improved, to, 405, lines, after, a, merger, with, marconi, the, baird, system, at, the, time, involved, an, intermediate, film, process, where, footage, was, shot, on, cinefilm, which, was, rapidly, developed, and, scanned, the, trial, was, due, to, last, for, 6, months, but, the, bbc, ceased, broadcasts, with, the, baird, system, in, february, 1937, due, in, part, to, a, disastrous, fire, in, the, baird, facilities, at, crystal, palace, it, was, becoming, apparent, to, the, bbc, that, the, baird, system, would, ultimately, fail, due, in, large, part, to, the, lack, of, mobility, of, the, baird, system, s, cameras, with, their, developer, tanks, hoses, and, cables, commercially, baird, s, contemporaries, such, as, george, william, walton, and, william, stephenson, were, ultimately, more, successful, as, their, patents, underpinned, the, early, television, system, used, by, scophony, limited, who, operated, in, britain, up, to, wwii, and, then, in, the, us, of, all, the, electro, mechanical, television, techniques, invented, and, developed, by, the, mid, 1930s, the, technology, known, as, scophony, had, no, rival, in, terms, of, technical, performance, in, 1948, scophony, acquired, john, logie, baird, ltd, baird, s, television, systems, were, replaced, by, the, first, fully, electronic, television, system, developed, by, the, newly, formed, company, emi, marconi, under, sir, isaac, shoenberg, who, headed, a, research, group, that, developed, an, advanced, camera, tube, the, emitron, and, a, relatively, efficient, hard, vacuum, cathode, ray, tube, for, the, television, receiver, philo, t, farnsworth, s, electronic, image, dissector, camera, was, available, to, baird, s, company, via, a, patent, sharing, agreement, however, the, image, dissector, camera, was, found, to, be, lacking, in, light, sensitivity, requiring, excessive, levels, of, illumination, the, baird, company, used, the, farnsworth, tubes, instead, to, scan, cinefilm, in, which, capacity, they, proved, serviceable, though, prone, to, drop, outs, and, other, problems, farnsworth, himself, came, to, london, to, the, baird, crystal, palace, laboratories, in, 1936, but, was, unable, to, fully, solve, the, problem, the, fire, that, burned, crystal, palace, to, the, ground, later, that, year, further, hampered, the, baird, company, s, ability, to, compete, baird, made, many, contributions, to, the, field, of, electronic, television, after, mechanical, systems, became, obsolete, in, 1939, he, showed, a, system, known, today, as, hybrid, colour, using, a, cathode, ray, tube, in, front, of, which, revolved, a, disc, fitted, with, colour, filters, a, method, taken, up, by, cbs, and, rca, in, the, united, states, as, early, as, 1940, baird, had, started, work, on, a, fully, electronic, system, he, called, the, telechrome, early, telechrome, devices, used, two, electron, guns, aimed, at, either, side, of, a, phosphor, plate, the, phosphor, was, patterned, so, the, electrons, from, the, guns, only, fell, on, one, side, of, the, patterning, or, the, other, using, cyan, and, magenta, phosphors, a, reasonable, limited, colour, image, could, be, obtained, he, also, demonstrated, the, same, system, using, monochrome, signals, to, produce, a, 3d, image, called, stereoscopic, at, the, time, in, 1941, he, patented, and, demonstrated, this, system, of, three, dimensional, television, at, a, definition, of, 500, lines, on, 16, august, 1944, he, gave, the, world, s, first, demonstration, of, a, practical, fully, electronic, colour, television, display, his, 600, line, colour, system, used, triple, interlacing, using, six, scans, to, build, each, picture, similar, concepts, were, common, through, the, 1940s, and, 50s, differing, primarily, in, the, way, they, re, combined, the, colours, generated, by, the, three, guns, one, of, them, the, geer, tube, was, similar, to, baird, s, concept, but, used, small, pyramids, with, the, phosphors, deposited, on, their, outside, faces, instead, of, baird, s, 3d, patterning, on, a, flat, surface, in, 1943, the, hankey, committee, was, appointed, to, oversee, the, resumption, of, television, broadcasts, after, the, war, baird, persuaded, them, to, make, plans, to, adopt, his, proposed, 1000, line, telechrome, electronic, colour, system, as, the, new, post, war, broadcast, standard, the, picture, resolution, on, this, system, would, have, been, comparable, to, today, s, hdtv, high, definition, television, the, hankey, committee, s, plan, lost, all, momentum, partly, due, to, the, challenges, of, postwar, reconstruction, the, monochrome, 405, line, standard, remained, in, place, until, 1985, in, some, areas, and, the, 625, line, system, was, introduced, in, 1964, and, pal, colour, in, 1967, a, demonstration, of, large, screen, three, dimensional, television, by, the, bbc, was, reported, in, march, 2008, over, 60, years, after, baird, s, demonstration, some, of, baird, s, early, inventions, were, not, fully, successful, in, his, twenties, he, tried, to, create, diamonds, by, heating, graphite, later, baird, invented, a, glass, razor, which, was, rust, resistant, but, shattered, inspired, by, pneumatic, tyres, he, attempted, to, make, pneumatic, shoes, but, his, prototype, contained, semi, inflated, balloons, which, burst, years, later, this, same, idea, was, successfully, adopted, for, dr, martens, boots, he, also, invented, a, thermal, undersock, the, baird, undersock, which, was, moderately, successful, baird, suffered, from, cold, feet, and, after, a, number, of, trials, he, found, that, an, extra, layer, of, cotton, inside, the, sock, provided, warmth, between, 1926, and, 1928, he, attempted, to, develop, an, early, video, recording, device, which, he, dubbed, phonovision, the, system, consisted, of, a, large, nipkow, scanning, disk, attached, by, a, mechanical, linkage, to, a, record, cutting, lathe, the, result, was, a, disc, that, could, record, a, 30, line, video, signal, technical, difficulties, with, the, system, prevented, its, further, development, but, some, of, the, original, phonovision, discs, have, been, preserved, baird, s, other, developments, were, in, fibre, optics, radio, direction, finding, infrared, night, viewing, and, radar, there, is, discussion, about, his, exact, contribution, to, the, development, of, radar, for, his, wartime, defence, projects, have, never, been, officially, acknowledged, by, the, uk, government, according, to, malcolm, baird, his, son, what, is, known, is, that, in, 1926, baird, filed, a, patent, for, a, device, that, formed, images, from, reflected, radio, waves, a, device, remarkably, similar, to, radar, and, that, he, was, in, correspondence, with, the, british, government, at, the, time, the, radar, contribution, is, in, dispute, according, to, some, experts, baird, s, noctovision, is, not, radar, unlike, radar, except, continuous, wave, radar, noctovision, is, incapable, of, determining, the, distance, to, the, scanned, subject, noctovision, also, cannot, determine, the, coordinates, of, the, subject, in, three, dimensional, space, from, december, 1944, logie, baird, lived, at, 1, station, road, bexhill, on, sea, east, sussex, he, later, died, there, on, 14, june, 1946, after, suffering, a, stroke, in, february, the, house, was, demolished, in, 2007, and, the, site, is, now, occupied, by, apartments, named, baird, court, logie, baird, is, buried, beside, his, parents, in, helensburgh, cemetery, argyll, scotland, australian, television, s, logie, awards, were, named, in, honour, of, john, logie, baird, s, contribution, to, the, invention, of, the, television, baird, became, the, only, deceased, subject, of, this, is, your, life, when, he, was, honoured, by, eamonn, andrews, at, the, bbc, television, theatre, in, 1957, in, 2014, the, society, of, motion, picture, and, television, engineers, smpte, inducted, logie, baird, into, the, honor, roll, which, posthumously, recognizes, individuals, who, were, not, awarded, honorary, membership, during, their, lifetimes, but, whose, contributions, would, have, been, sufficient, to, warrant, such, an, honor, in, 2013, historic, environment, scotland, awarded, a, plaque, to, commemorate, logie, baird, it, can, be, found, in, helensburgh, books, patents
