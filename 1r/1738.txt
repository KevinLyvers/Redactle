alfred, lothar, wegener, v, e, n, r, german, 1, november, 1880, november, 1930, was, a, german, climatologist, geologist, geophysicist, meteorologist, and, polar, researcher, during, his, lifetime, he, was, primarily, known, for, his, achievements, in, meteorology, and, as, a, pioneer, of, polar, research, but, today, he, is, most, remembered, as, the, originator, of, continental, drift, hypothesis, by, suggesting, in, 1912, that, the, continents, are, slowly, drifting, around, the, earth, german, kontinentalverschiebung, his, hypothesis, was, not, accepted, by, mainstream, geology, until, the, 1950s, when, numerous, discoveries, such, as, palaeomagnetism, provided, strong, support, for, continental, drift, and, thereby, a, substantial, basis, for, today, s, model, of, plate, tectonics, wegener, was, involved, in, several, expeditions, to, greenland, to, study, polar, air, circulation, before, the, existence, of, the, jet, stream, was, accepted, expedition, participants, made, many, meteorological, observations, and, were, the, first, to, overwinter, on, the, inland, greenland, ice, sheet, and, the, first, to, bore, ice, cores, on, a, moving, arctic, glacier, alfred, wegener, was, born, in, berlin, on, 1, november, 1880, the, youngest, of, five, children, to, richard, wegener, and, his, wife, anna, his, father, was, a, theologian, and, teacher, of, classical, languages, at, the, joachimsthalschen, gymnasium, and, berlinisches, gymnasium, zum, grauen, kloster, in, 1886, his, family, purchased, a, former, manor, house, near, rheinsberg, which, they, used, as, a, vacation, home, wegener, attended, school, at, the, k, llnische, gymnasium, on, wallstrasse, in, berlin, completing, his, abitur, in, 1899, graduating, as, the, best, in, his, class, wegener, studied, physics, meteorology, and, astronomy, at, the, friedrich, wilhelm, university, in, berlin, completing, two, external, semesters, at, heidelberg, and, innsbruck, his, teachers, included, wilhelm, f, rster, for, astronomy, and, max, planck, for, thermodynamics, from, 1902, to, 1903, during, his, studies, he, was, an, assistant, at, the, urania, astronomical, observatory, he, completed, his, doctoral, dissertation, on, the, subject, of, applying, the, astronomical, data, of, alfonsine, tables, to, contemporary, computational, methods, in, 1905, under, the, supervision, of, julius, bauschinger, and, wilhelm, f, rster, despite, becoming, a, doctor, in, the, field, of, astronomy, wegener, had, always, maintained, a, strong, interest, in, the, developing, fields, of, meteorology, and, climatology, and, his, studies, afterwards, focused, on, these, disciplines, in, 1905, wegener, became, an, assistant, at, the, aeronautisches, observatorium, lindenberg, near, beeskow, he, worked, there, with, his, brother, kurt, who, was, likewise, a, scientist, with, an, interest, in, meteorology, and, polar, research, the, two, pioneered, the, use, of, weather, balloons, to, track, air, masses, on, a, balloon, ascent, undertaken, to, carry, out, meteorological, investigations, and, to, test, a, celestial, navigation, method, using, a, particular, type, of, quadrant, libellenquadrant, the, wegener, brothers, set, a, new, record, for, a, continuous, balloon, flight, remaining, aloft, 52, 5, hours, from, 5, 7, april, 1906, his, observations, during, his, time, at, the, observatorium, made, a, significant, contribution, to, the, field, of, atmospheric, physics, in, that, same, year, 1906, wegener, participated, in, the, first, of, his, four, greenland, expeditions, later, regarding, this, experience, as, marking, a, decisive, turning, point, in, his, life, the, denmark, expedition, was, led, by, the, dane, ludvig, mylius, erichsen, and, charged, with, studying, the, last, unknown, portion, of, the, northeastern, coast, of, greenland, during, the, expedition, wegener, constructed, the, first, meteorological, station, in, greenland, near, danmarkshavn, where, he, launched, kites, and, tethered, balloons, to, make, meteorological, measurements, in, an, arctic, climatic, zone, here, wegener, also, made, his, first, acquaintance, with, death, in, a, wilderness, of, ice, when, the, expedition, leader, and, two, of, his, colleagues, died, on, an, exploratory, trip, undertaken, with, sled, dogs, after, his, return, in, 1908, and, until, world, war, i, wegener, was, a, lecturer, in, meteorology, applied, astronomy, and, cosmic, physics, at, the, university, of, marburg, his, students, and, colleagues, in, marburg, particularly, valued, his, ability, to, clearly, and, understandably, explain, even, complex, topics, and, current, research, findings, without, sacrificing, precision, his, lectures, formed, the, basis, of, what, was, to, become, a, standard, textbook, in, meteorology, first, written, in, 1909, 1910, thermodynamik, der, atmosph, re, thermodynamics, of, the, atmosphere, in, which, he, incorporated, many, of, the, results, of, the, greenland, expedition, on, 6, january, 1912, he, presented, his, first, proposal, of, continental, drift, in, a, lecture, to, the, geologische, vereinigung, geological, association, at, the, senckenberg, museum, frankfurt, am, main, later, in, 1912, he, made, the, case, for, the, theory, in, a, long, three, part, article, and, a, shorter, summary, plans, for, a, new, greenland, expedition, grew, out, of, wegener, and, johan, peter, koch, s, frustration, with, the, disorganisation, and, meager, scientific, results, of, the, danmark, expedition, the, new, danish, expedition, to, queen, louise, land, would, involve, only, four, men, take, place, in, 1912, 1913, and, have, koch, for, leader, after, a, stopover, in, iceland, to, purchase, and, test, ponies, as, pack, animals, the, expedition, arrived, in, danmarkshavn, even, before, the, trip, to, the, inland, ice, began, the, expedition, was, almost, annihilated, by, a, calving, glacier, koch, broke, his, leg, when, he, fell, into, a, glacier, crevasse, and, spent, months, recovering, in, a, sickbed, wegener, and, koch, were, the, first, to, winter, on, the, inland, ice, in, northeast, greenland, inside, their, hut, they, drilled, to, a, depth, of, 25, m, with, an, auger, in, summer, 1913, the, team, crossed, the, inland, ice, the, four, expedition, participants, covering, a, distance, twice, as, long, as, fridtjof, nansen, s, southern, greenland, crossing, in, 1888, only, a, few, kilometres, from, the, western, greenland, settlement, of, kangersuatsiaq, the, small, team, ran, out, of, food, while, struggling, to, find, their, way, through, difficult, glacial, break, up, terrain, but, at, the, last, moment, after, the, last, pony, and, dog, had, been, eaten, they, were, picked, up, at, a, fjord, by, the, clergyman, of, upernavik, who, just, happened, to, be, visiting, a, remote, congregation, at, the, time, later, in, 1913, after, his, return, wegener, married, else, k, ppen, the, daughter, of, his, former, teacher, and, mentor, the, meteorologist, wladimir, k, ppen, the, young, pair, lived, in, marburg, where, wegener, resumed, his, university, lectureship, there, his, two, older, daughters, were, born, hilde, 1914, 1936, and, sophie, k, te, 1918, 2012, their, third, daughter, hanna, charlotte, lotte, 1920, 1989, was, born, in, hamburg, lotte, would, in, 1938, marry, the, famous, austrian, mountaineer, and, adventurer, heinrich, harrer, while, in, 1939, k, te, married, siegfried, uiberreither, austrian, nazi, gauleiter, of, styria, as, an, infantry, reserve, officer, wegener, was, immediately, called, up, when, the, first, world, war, began, in, 1914, on, the, war, front, in, belgium, he, experienced, fierce, fighting, but, his, term, lasted, only, a, few, months, after, being, wounded, twice, he, was, declared, unfit, for, active, service, and, assigned, to, the, army, weather, service, this, activity, required, him, to, travel, constantly, between, various, weather, stations, in, germany, on, the, balkans, on, the, western, front, and, in, the, baltic, region, nevertheless, he, was, able, in, 1915, to, complete, the, first, version, of, his, major, work, die, entstehung, der, kontinente, und, ozeane, the, origin, of, continents, and, oceans, his, brother, kurt, remarked, that, alfred, wegener, s, motivation, was, to, reestablish, the, connection, between, geophysics, on, the, one, hand, and, geography, and, geology, on, the, other, which, had, become, completely, ruptured, because, of, the, specialized, development, of, these, branches, of, science, interest, in, this, small, publication, was, however, low, also, because, of, wartime, chaos, by, the, end, of, the, war, wegener, had, published, almost, 20, additional, meteorological, and, geophysical, papers, in, which, he, repeatedly, embarked, for, new, scientific, frontiers, in, 1917, he, undertook, a, scientific, investigation, of, the, treysa, meteorite, in, 1919, wegener, replaced, k, ppen, as, head, of, the, meteorological, department, at, the, german, naval, observatory, deutsche, seewarte, and, moved, to, hamburg, with, his, wife, and, their, two, daughters, in, 1921, he, was, moreover, appointed, senior, lecturer, at, the, new, university, of, hamburg, from, 1919, to, 1923, wegener, did, pioneering, work, on, reconstructing, the, climate, of, past, eras, now, known, as, paleoclimatology, closely, in, collaboration, with, milutin, milankovi, publishing, die, klimate, der, geologischen, vorzeit, the, climates, of, the, geological, past, together, with, his, father, in, law, wladimir, k, ppen, in, 1924, in, 1922, the, third, fully, revised, edition, of, the, origin, of, continents, and, oceans, appeared, and, discussion, began, on, his, theory, of, continental, drift, first, in, the, german, language, area, and, later, internationally, withering, criticism, was, the, response, of, most, experts, in, 1924, wegener, was, appointed, to, a, professorship, in, meteorology, and, geophysics, in, graz, a, position, that, was, both, secure, and, free, of, administrative, duties, he, concentrated, on, physics, and, the, optics, of, the, atmosphere, as, well, as, the, study, of, tornadoes, he, had, studied, tornadoes, for, several, years, by, this, point, publishing, the, first, thorough, european, tornado, climatology, in, 1917, he, also, posited, tornado, vortex, structures, and, formative, processes, scientific, assessment, of, his, second, greenland, expedition, ice, measurements, atmospheric, optics, etc, continued, to, the, end, of, the, 1920s, in, november, 1926, wegener, presented, his, continental, drift, theory, at, a, symposium, of, the, american, association, of, petroleum, geologists, in, new, york, city, again, earning, rejection, from, everyone, but, the, chairman, three, years, later, the, fourth, and, final, expanded, edition, of, the, origin, of, continents, and, oceans, appeared, in, april, october, 1929, wegener, embarked, on, his, third, expedition, to, greenland, which, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, german, greenland, expedition, which, he, was, planning, to, lead, in, 1930, 1931, wegener, s, last, greenland, expedition, was, in, 1930, the, 14, participants, under, his, leadership, were, to, establish, three, permanent, stations, from, which, the, thickness, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, could, be, measured, and, year, round, arctic, weather, observations, made, they, would, travel, on, the, ice, cap, using, two, innovative, propeller, driven, snowmobiles, in, addition, to, ponies, and, dog, sleds, wegener, felt, personally, responsible, for, the, expedition, s, success, as, the, german, government, had, contributed, 120, 000, 1, 5, million, in, 2007, dollars, success, depended, on, enough, provisions, being, transferred, from, west, camp, to, eismitte, mid, ice, also, known, as, central, station, for, two, men, to, winter, there, and, this, was, a, factor, in, the, decision, that, led, to, his, death, owing, to, a, late, thaw, the, expedition, was, six, weeks, behind, schedule, and, as, summer, ended, the, men, at, eismitte, sent, a, message, that, they, had, insufficient, fuel, and, so, would, return, on, 20, october, on, 24, september, although, the, route, markers, were, by, now, largely, buried, under, snow, wegener, set, out, with, thirteen, greenlanders, and, his, meteorologist, fritz, loewe, to, supply, the, camp, by, dog, sled, during, the, journey, the, temperature, reached, 60, c, 76, f, and, loewe, s, toes, became, so, frostbitten, they, had, to, be, amputated, with, a, penknife, without, anaesthetic, twelve, of, the, greenlanders, returned, to, west, camp, on, 19, october, the, remaining, three, members, of, the, expedition, reached, eismitte, expedition, member, johannes, georgi, estimated, that, there, were, only, enough, supplies, for, three, at, eismitte, so, wegener, and, 27, year, old, native, greenlander, rasmus, villumsen, took, two, dog, sleds, and, made, for, west, camp, georgi, later, found, that, he, had, underestimated, the, supplies, and, that, wegener, and, villumsen, could, have, overwintered, at, eismitte, they, took, no, food, for, the, dogs, and, killed, them, one, by, one, to, feed, the, rest, until, they, could, run, only, one, sled, while, villumsen, rode, the, sled, wegener, had, to, use, skis, but, they, never, reached, the, camp, wegener, died, in, his, tent, around, 90, miles, from, eismitte, and, was, hastily, buried, with, his, skis, stuck, upright, in, the, snow, villumsen, resumed, his, journey, but, he, was, never, seen, again, six, months, later, on, 12, may, 1931, wegener, s, skis, were, discovered, expedition, members, built, a, pyramid, shaped, mausoleum, in, the, ice, and, snow, and, alfred, wegener, s, body, was, laid, to, rest, wegener, had, been, 50, years, of, age, and, a, heavy, smoker, and, it, was, believed, that, he, had, died, of, heart, failure, brought, on, by, overexertion, kurt, wegener, took, over, the, expedition, s, leadership, in, july, according, to, the, prearranged, plan, for, such, an, eventuality, wegener, first, thought, of, this, idea, by, noticing, that, the, different, large, landmasses, of, the, earth, almost, fit, together, like, a, jigsaw, puzzle, the, continental, shelf, of, the, americas, fits, closely, to, africa, and, europe, antarctica, australia, india, and, madagascar, fit, next, to, the, tip, of, southern, africa, but, wegener, only, published, his, idea, after, reading, a, paper, in, 1911, which, criticised, the, prevalent, hypothesis, that, a, bridge, of, land, once, connected, europe, and, america, on, the, grounds, that, this, contradicts, isostasy, wegener, s, main, interest, was, meteorology, and, he, wanted, to, join, the, denmark, greenland, expedition, scheduled, for, mid, 1912, he, presented, his, continental, drift, hypothesis, on, 6, january, 1912, he, analysed, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, ocean, for, rock, type, geological, structures, and, fossils, he, noticed, that, there, was, a, significant, similarity, between, matching, sides, of, the, continents, especially, in, fossil, plants, from, 1912, wegener, publicly, advocated, the, existence, of, continental, drift, arguing, that, all, the, continents, were, once, joined, in, a, single, landmass, and, had, since, drifted, apart, he, supposed, that, the, mechanisms, causing, the, drift, might, be, the, centrifugal, force, of, the, earth, s, rotation, polflucht, or, the, astronomical, precession, wegener, also, speculated, about, sea, floor, spreading, and, the, role, of, the, mid, ocean, ridges, stating, that, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, zone, in, which, the, floor, of, the, atlantic, as, it, keeps, spreading, is, continuously, tearing, open, and, making, space, for, fresh, relatively, fluid, and, hot, sima, from, depth, however, he, did, not, pursue, these, ideas, in, his, later, works, in, 1915, in, the, first, edition, of, his, book, die, entstehung, der, kontinente, und, ozeane, written, in, german, wegener, drew, together, evidence, from, various, fields, to, advance, the, theory, that, there, had, once, been, a, giant, continent, which, he, named, urkontinent, german, for, primal, continent, analogous, to, the, greek, pangaea, meaning, all, lands, or, all, earth, expanded, editions, during, the, 1920s, presented, further, evidence, the, first, english, edition, was, published, in, 1924, as, the, origin, of, continents, and, oceans, a, translation, of, the, 1922, third, german, edition, the, last, german, edition, published, in, 1929, revealed, the, significant, observation, that, shallower, oceans, were, geologically, younger, it, was, not, translated, into, english, until, 1962, note, prior, advocates, for, various, forms, of, continental, dynamics, abraham, ortelius, antonio, snider, pellegrini, eduard, suess, roberto, mantovani, otto, ampferer, and, frank, bursley, taylor, in, his, work, wegener, presented, a, large, amount, of, observational, evidence, in, support, of, continental, drift, but, the, mechanism, remained, a, problem, partly, because, wegener, s, estimate, of, the, velocity, of, continental, motion, 250, cm, year, was, too, high, the, currently, accepted, rate, for, the, separation, of, the, americas, from, europe, and, africa, is, about, 2, 5, cm, year, while, his, ideas, attracted, a, few, early, supporters, such, as, alexander, du, toit, from, south, africa, arthur, holmes, in, england, and, milutin, milankovi, in, serbia, for, whom, continental, drift, theory, was, the, premise, for, investigating, polar, wandering, the, hypothesis, was, initially, met, with, scepticism, from, geologists, who, viewed, wegener, as, an, outsider, and, were, resistant, to, change, the, german, geologist, max, semper, wrote, a, critique, of, the, theory, which, culminated, in, this, mockery, against, wegener, so, one, can, only, ask, for, the, necessary, distance, to, be, maintained, and, the, request, to, stop, honouring, geology, in, the, future, but, to, visit, specialist, areas, that, have, so, far, forgotten, to, write, above, their, gate, oh, holy, saint, florian, spare, this, house, set, others, on, fire, max, semper, 1917, nevertheless, the, eminent, swiss, geologist, mile, argand, advocated, wegener, s, theory, in, his, inaugural, address, to, the, 1922, international, geological, congress, the, one, american, edition, of, wegener, s, work, published, in, 1925, was, written, in, a, dogmatic, style, that, often, results, from, german, translations, in, 1926, at, the, initiative, of, willem, van, der, gracht, the, american, association, of, petroleum, geologists, organised, a, symposium, on, the, continental, drift, hypothesis, the, opponents, argued, as, did, the, leipziger, geologist, franz, kossmat, that, the, oceanic, crust, was, too, firm, for, the, continents, to, simply, plough, through, from, at, least, 1910, wegener, imagined, the, continents, once, fitting, together, not, at, the, current, shore, line, but, 200, m, below, this, at, the, level, of, the, continental, shelves, where, they, match, well, part, of, the, reason, wegener, s, ideas, were, not, initially, accepted, was, the, misapprehension, that, he, was, suggesting, the, continents, had, fit, along, the, current, coastline, charles, schuchert, commented, during, this, vast, time, the, sea, waves, have, been, continuously, pounding, against, africa, and, brazil, and, in, many, places, rivers, have, been, bringing, into, the, ocean, great, amounts, of, eroded, material, yet, everywhere, the, geographic, shore, lines, are, said, to, have, remained, practically, unchanged, it, apparently, makes, no, difference, to, wegener, how, hard, or, how, soft, are, the, rocks, of, these, shore, lines, what, are, their, geological, structures, that, might, aid, or, retard, land, or, marine, erosion, how, often, the, strand, lines, have, been, elevated, or, depressed, and, how, far, peneplanation, has, gone, on, during, each, period, of, continental, stability, furthermore, sea, level, in, itself, has, not, been, constant, especially, during, the, pleistocene, when, the, lands, were, covered, by, millions, of, square, miles, of, ice, made, from, water, subtracted, out, of, the, oceans, in, the, equatorial, regions, this, level, fluctuated, three, times, during, the, pleistocene, and, during, each, period, of, ice, accumulation, the, sea, level, sank, about, 250, feet, wegener, was, in, the, audience, for, this, lecture, but, made, no, attempt, to, defend, his, work, possibly, because, of, an, inadequate, command, of, the, english, language, in, 1943, george, gaylord, simpson, wrote, a, strong, critique, of, the, theory, as, well, as, the, rival, theory, of, sunken, land, bridges, and, gave, evidence, for, the, idea, that, similarities, of, flora, and, fauna, between, the, continents, could, best, be, explained, by, these, being, fixed, land, masses, which, over, time, were, connected, and, disconnected, by, periodic, flooding, a, theory, known, as, permanentism, alexander, du, toit, wrote, a, rejoinder, to, this, the, following, year, alfred, wegener, has, been, mischaracterised, as, a, lone, genius, whose, theory, of, continental, drift, met, widespread, rejection, until, well, after, his, death, in, fact, the, main, tenets, of, the, theory, gained, widespread, acceptance, by, european, researchers, already, in, the, 1920s, and, the, debates, were, mostly, about, specific, details, however, the, theory, took, longer, to, be, accepted, in, north, america, in, the, early, 1950s, the, new, science, of, paleomagnetism, pioneered, at, the, university, of, cambridge, by, s, k, runcorn, and, at, imperial, college, by, p, m, s, blackett, was, soon, producing, data, in, favour, of, wegener, s, theory, by, early, 1953, samples, taken, from, india, showed, that, the, country, had, previously, been, in, the, southern, hemisphere, as, predicted, by, wegener, by, 1959, the, theory, had, enough, supporting, data, that, minds, were, starting, to, change, particularly, in, the, united, kingdom, where, in, 1964, the, royal, society, held, a, symposium, on, the, subject, the, 1960s, saw, several, relevant, developments, in, geology, notably, the, discoveries, of, seafloor, spreading, and, wadati, benioff, zones, and, this, led, to, the, rapid, resurrection, of, the, continental, drift, hypothesis, in, the, form, of, its, direct, descendant, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, maps, of, the, geomorphology, of, the, ocean, floors, created, by, marie, tharp, in, cooperation, with, bruce, heezen, were, an, important, contribution, to, the, paradigm, shift, that, was, starting, wegener, was, then, recognised, as, the, founding, father, of, one, of, the, major, scientific, revolutions, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, advent, of, the, global, positioning, system, gps, in, 1993, it, became, possible, to, measure, continental, drift, directly, the, alfred, wegener, institute, for, polar, and, marine, research, in, bremerhaven, germany, was, established, in, 1980, on, wegener, s, centenary, it, awards, the, wegener, medal, in, his, name, the, crater, wegener, on, the, moon, and, the, crater, wegener, on, mars, as, well, as, the, asteroid, 29227, wegener, the, wegener, peninsula, in, eastern, greenland, and, the, peninsula, where, he, died, in, western, greenland, near, ummannaq, 71, 12, n, 51, 50, w, 71, 200, n, 51, 833, w, 71, 200, 51, 833, are, named, after, him, the, european, geosciences, union, sponsors, an, alfred, wegener, medal, honorary, membership, for, scientists, who, have, achieved, exceptional, international, standing, in, atmospheric, hydrological, or, ocean, sciences, defined, in, their, widest, senses, for, their, merit, and, their, scientific, achievements
