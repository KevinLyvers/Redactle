painting, eluded, him, yet, he, tried, repeatedly, to, master, the, art, and, there, are, several, references, to, this, in, his, early, letters, and, reminiscence, in, 1900, for, instance, when, he, was, nearing, forty, and, already, a, celebrated, writer, he, wrote, to, jagadish, chandra, bose, you, will, be, surprised, to, hear, that, i, am, sitting, with, a, sketchbook, drawing, needless, to, say, the, pictures, are, not, intended, for, any, salon, in, paris, they, cause, me, not, the, least, suspicion, that, the, national, gallery, of, any, country, will, suddenly, decide, to, raise, taxes, to, acquire, them, but, just, as, a, mother, lavishes, most, affection, on, her, ugliest, son, so, i, feel, secretly, drawn, to, the, very, skill, that, comes, to, me, least, easily, he, also, realized, that, he, was, using, the, eraser, more, than, the, pencil, and, dissatisfied, with, the, results, he, finally, withdrew, deciding, it, was, not, for, him, to, become, a, painter, india, s,

views, were, first, revealed, in, manast, which, was, mostly, composed, in, his, twenties, evidence, produced, during, the, hindu, german, conspiracy, trial, and, latter, accounts, affirm, his, awareness, of, the, ghadarites, and, stated, that, he, sought, the, support, of, japanese, prime, minister, terauchi, masatake, and, former, premier, kuma, shigenobu, yet, he, lampooned, the,

independence, movement, and, he, wanted, to, assert, india, s, right, to, be, independent, without, denying, the, importance, of, what, india, could, learn, from, abroad, he, urged, the, masses, to, avoid, victimology, and, instead, seek, self, help, and, education, and, he, saw, the, presence, of, british, administration, as, a, political, symptom, of, our, social, disease, he, maintained, that, even, for, those, at, the, extremes, of, poverty, there, can, be, no, question, of, blind, revolution, preferable, to, it, was, a, steady, and, purposeful, education, so, i, repeat, we, never, can, have, a, true, view, of, man, unless, we, have, a, love, for, him, civilisation, must, be, judged, and, prized, not, by, the, amount, of, power, it, has, developed, but, by, how, much, it, has,
