campaign, spending, was, so, massive, that, it, would, be, responsible, for, the, balance, of, payments, crisis, of, 1970, whose, inflationary, effect, would, cause, social, unrest, leading, all, the, way, up, to, the, proclamation, of, martial, law, in, 1972, marcos, was, reported, to, have, spent, php100, for, every, php1, that, osme, a, spent, using, up, php24, million, in, cebu, alone, with, his, popularity, already, beefed, up, by, debt, funded, spending, marcos, s, popularity, made, it, very, likely, that, he, would, win, the, election, but, he, decided, as, national, artist, for, literature, nick, joaquin, reported, in, the, philippines, free, press, to, leave, nothing, to, chance, time, and, newsweek, would, eventually, call, the, 1969, election, the, dirtiest, most, violent, and, most, corrupt, in, philippine, modern, history, with, the, term, three, gs, meaning, guns, goons, and, gold, coined, to, describe, administration, s, election, tactics, of, vote, buying,

the, relaxation, of, controls, of, the, peso, were, put, in, place, the, peso, was, allowed, to, float, to, a, lower, market, value, resulting, in, drastic, inflation, and, social, unrest, from, the, 1960s, ferdinand, marcos, would, engage, in, unofficial, diplomacy, with, the, soviet, bloc, in, ways, that, were, shaped, by, the, sino, soviet, split, the, partido, komunista, ng, pilipinas, 1930, an, officially, illegal, organization, had, endorsed, marcos, in, 1965, the, formation, of, the, china, aligned, communist, party, of, the, philippines, led, to, government, support, of, the, soviet, aligned, partido, komunista, ng, pilipinas, 1930, some, members, of, the, pkp, 1930, were, appointed, to, positions, within, marcos, s, government, as, salaried, researchers, their, transnational, connections, were, used, as, another, channel, of, negotiation, with, the, soviet, union, on, geopolitical, and, economic, lines, presidential, elections, were, held, on, november, 11, 1969, and, marcos, was, reelected, for, a, second, term, he, was, the, first, and, last, filipino, president, to, win, a, second, full, term, his, running, mate, incumbent, vice, president, fernando, lopez, was, also, elected, to, a, third, full, term, as, vice, president, of, the, philippines, marcos, s, second, term, was, characterized, by, social, unrest, beginning, with, the, 1969, philippine, balance, of, payments, crisis, which, was, already, underway, during, the, second, inauguration, opposition, groups, began, to, form, with, moderate, groups, calling, for, political, reform, and, radical, groups, who, espoused, a, more, radical, left, ideology, marcos, responded, to, both, groups, with, military, force, the, most, notable, of, these, was, the, series, of, protests, during, the, first, three, months, of, 1970, a, period, that, has, since, come, to, be, known, as, the, first, quarter, storm, another, major, event, during, marcos, s, second, term, was, the, philippine, constitutional, convention, of, 1971, which, was, marred, in, may, 1972, when, a, delegate, exposed, a, bribery, scheme, in, which, delegates, were, paid, to, vote, in, favor, of, the, marcoses, with, first, lady, imelda, marcos, herself, implicated, in, the, alleged, payola, scheme, 133, on, august, 21, 1971, a, political, campaign, rally, of, the, opposition, liberal, party, at, plaza, miranda, in, the, district, of, quiapo, manila, marcos, blamed, the, then, still, nascent, communist, party, of, the, philippines, and, issued, proclamation, no, 889, through, which, he, assumed, emergency, powers, and, suspended, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, oppositionists, were, arrested, after, being, accused, of, being, radicals, marcos, s, response, further, obscured, the, distinction, between, the, moderates, and, radical, opposition, which, had, already, been, blurred, since, the, first, quarter, storm, this, brought, about, a, massive, expansion, of, the, underground, socialist, resistance, when, many, moderate, oppositionists, saw, no, other, choice, than, to, join, the, radicals, in, 1972, a, series, of, bombings, in, metro, manila, took, place, ratcheting, up, the, tension, marcos, again, blamed, the, communists, although, the, only, suspects, caught, in, connection, to, the, explosions, were, linked, to, the, philippine, constabulary, marcos, s, second, term, effectively, ended, a, little, under, two, years, and, nine, months, later, when, marcos, announced, on, september, 23, 1972, that, he, had, placed, the, philippines, under, martial, law, while, marcos, had, won, the, november, 1969, election, by, a, landslide, and, was, inaugurated, on, december, 30, of, that, year, marcos, s, massive, spending, during, the, 1969, presidential, campaign, triggered, growing, public, unrest, marcos, s, spending, during, the, campaign, led, to, opposition, figures, such, as, senator, lorenzo, ta, ada, senator, jovito, salonga, and, senator, jose, w, diokno, to, accuse, marcos, of, wanting, to, stay, in, power, even, beyond, the, two, term, maximum, set, for, the, presidency, by, the, 1935, constitution, opposition, groups, quickly, grew, in, the, campuses, where, students, had, the, time, and, opportunity, to, be, aware, of, political, and, economic, issues, the, media, reports, of, the, time, classified, the, various, civil, society, groups, opposing, marcos, into, two, categories, the, moderates, which, included, church, groups, civil, libertarians, and, nationalist, politicians, were, those, who, wanted, to, create, change, through, political, reforms, the, radicals, including, a, number, of, labor, and, student, groups, wanted, broader, more, systemic, political, reforms, with, the, constitutional, convention, occupying, their, attention, from, 1971, to, 1973, statesmen, and, politicians, opposed, to, the, increasingly, more, authoritarian, administration, of, ferdinand, marcos, mostly, focused, their, efforts, on, political, efforts, from, within, the, halls, of, power, their, concerns, varied, but, usually, included, election, reform, calls, for, a, non, partisan, constitutional, convention, and, a, call, for, marcos, not, to, exceed, the, two, presidential, terms, allowed, him, by, the, 1935, constitution, this, notably, included, the, national, union, of, students, in, the, philippines, the, national, students, league, nsl, and, later, the, movement, of, concerned, citizens, for, civil, liberties, or, mcccl, led, by, senator, jose, w, diokno, the, mcccl, s, rallies, are, particularly, remembered, for, their, diversity, attracting, participants, from, both, the, moderate, and, radical, camps, and, for, their, scale, with, the, biggest, one, attended, by, as, many, as, 50, 000, people, the, other, broad, category, of, opposition, groups, during, this, period, were, those, who, wanted, broader, more, systemic, political, reforms, usually, as, part, of, the, national, democracy, movement, these, groups, were, branded, radicals, by, the, media, although, the, marcos, administration, extended, that, term, to, moderate, protest, groups, as, well, groups, considered, radical, by, the, media, of, the, time, included, when, marcos, became, president, in, 1965, philippine, policy, and, politics, functioned, under, a, post, world, war, ii, geopolitical, framework, as, a, result, the, philippines, was, ideologically, caught, up, in, the, anti, communist, scare, perpetuated, by, the, us, during, the, cold, war, marcos, and, the, afp, thus, emphasized, the, threat, represented, by, the, formation, of, the, communist, party, of, the, philippines, in, 1969, even, if, it, was, still, a, small, organization, 43, partly, because, doing, so, was, good, for, building, up, the, afp, budget, 43, as, a, result, notes, security, specialist, richard, j, kessler, this, mythologized, the, group, investing, it, with, a, revolutionary, aura, that, only, attracted, more, supporters, the, social, unrest, of, 1969, to, 1970, and, the, violent, dispersal, of, the, resulting, first, quarter, storm, protests, were, among, the, early, watershed, events, in, which, large, numbers, of, filipino, students, of, the, 1970s, were, radicalized, against, the, marcos, administration, due, to, these, dispersals, many, students, who, had, previously, held, moderate, positions, i, e, calling, for, legislative, reforms, became, convinced, that, they, had, no, other, choice, but, to, call, for, more, radical, social, change, other, watershed, events, that, would, later, radicalize, many, otherwise, moderate, opposition, members, include, the, february, 1971, diliman, commune, the, august, 1971, suspension, of, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, in, the, wake, of, the, plaza, miranda, bombing, the, september, 1972, declaration, of, martial, law, the, 1980, murder, of, macli, ing, dulag, and, the, august, 1983, assassination, of, ninoy, aquino, by, 1970, study, sessions, on, marxism, leninism, had, become, common, in, the, campuses, and, many, student, activists, were, joining, various, organizations, associated, with, the, national, democracy, movement, nd, such, as, the, student, cultural, association, of, the, university, of, the, philippines, scaup, and, the, kabataang, makabayan, km, lit, patriotic, youth, which, were, founded, by, jose, maria, sison, the, samahang, demokratiko, ng, kabataan, sdk, which, was, founded, as, a, separate, organization, from, the, scaup, and, km, by, a, group, of, young, writer, leaders, and, others, the, line, between, leftist, activists, and, communists, became, increasingly, blurred, as, a, significant, number, of, radicalized, activists, also, joined, the, communist, party, of, the, philippines, radicalized, activists, from, the, cities, began, to, be, more, extensively, deployed, in, rural, areas, were, some, became, guerillas, by, the, time, marcos, gave, the, first, state, of, the, nation, address, of, his, second, term, on, january, 26, 1970, the, unrest, born, from, the, 1969, 1970, balance, of, payments, crisis, exploded, into, a, series, of, demonstrations, protests, and, marches, against, the, government, student, groups, some, moderate, and, some, radical, served, as, the, driving, force, of, the, protests, which, lasted, until, the, end, of, the, university, semester, in, march, 1970, and, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, first, quarter, storm, during, marcos, s, january, 26, 1970, state, of, the, nation, address, the, moderate, national, union, of, students, of, the, philippines, organized, a, protest, in, front, of, congress, and, invited, student, groups, both, moderate, and, radical, to, join, them, some, of, the, students, participating, in, the, protest, harangued, marcos, as, he, and, his, wife, imelda, as, they, left, the, congress, building, throwing, a, coffin, a, stuffed, alligator, and, stones, at, them, the, next, major, protest, took, place, on, january, 30, in, front, of, the, presidential, palace, where, activists, rammed, the, gate, with, a, fire, truck, and, once, the, gate, broke, and, gave, way, the, activists, charged, into, the, palace, grounds, tossing, rocks, pillboxes, and, molotov, cocktails, at, least, two, activists, were, confirmed, dead, and, several, were, injured, by, the, police, five, more, major, protests, took, place, in, the, metro, manila, area, took, place, between, then, and, march, 17, 1970, what, some, media, accounts, would, later, brand, the, 7, deadly, protests, of, the, first, quarter, storm, this, included, a, february, 12, rally, at, plaza, miranda, a, february, 18, demonstration, dubbed, the, people, s, congress, also, supposed, to, be, at, the, plaza, miranda, but, dispersed, early, resulting, in, protesters, proceeding, to, the, us, embassy, where, they, set, fire, to, the, lobby, a, second, people, s, congress, demonstration, on, february, 26, a, people, s, march, from, welcome, rotonda, to, plaza,

marcos, s, policies, and, citing, rising, discontent, over, wide, inequalities, in, society, civil, society, groups, and, opposition, leaders, began, campaigning, in, 1967, to, initiate, a, constitutional, convention, which, would, revise, change, the, 1935, constitution, of, the, philippines, on, march, 16, of, that, year, the, philippine, congress, constituted, itself, into, a, constituent, assembly, and, passed, resolution, no, 2, which, called, for, a, constitutional, convention, to, change, the, 1935, constitution, marcos, surprised, his, critics, by, endorsing, the, move, but, historians, later, noted, that, the, resulting, constitutional, convention, would, lay, the, foundation, for, the, legal, justifications, marcos, would, use, to, extend, his, term, past, the, two, four, year, terms, allowable, under, the, 1935, constitution, a, special, election, was, held, on, november, 10, 1970, to, elect, the, delegates, of, the, convention, 130, once, the,

been, bogged, down, by, politicking, and, delays, when, its, credibility, took, a, severe, blow, in, may, 1972, when, a, delegate, exposed, a, bribery, scheme, in, which, delegates, were, paid, to, vote, in, favor, of, the, marcoses, with, first, lady, imelda, marcos, herself, implicated, in, the, alleged, payola, scheme, 133, the, investigation, on, the, scheme, was, effectively, shelved, when, marcos, declared, martial, law, in, september, 1972, and, had, 11, opposition, delegates, arrested, the, remaining, opposition, delegates, were, forced, to, go, either, into, exile, or, hiding, within, two, months, an, entirely, new, draft, of, the, constitution, was, created, from, scratch, by, a, special, committee, the, 1973, constitutional, plebiscite, was, called, to, ratify, the, new, constitution, but, the, validity, of, the, ratification, was, brought, to, question, because, marcos, replaced, the, method, of, voting, through, secret, ballot, with, a, system, of, viva, voce, voting, by, citizen, s, assemblies, 213, the, ratification, of, the, constitution, was, challenged, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, ratification, cases, on, december, 29, 1970, philippine,

brewing, a, report, of, the, us, senate, foreign, relations, committee, said, that, shortly, after, the, 1969, philippine, presidential, election, a, group, composed, mostly, of, retired, colonels, and, generals, organized, a, revolutionary, junta, with, the, aim, of, first, discrediting, president, marcos, and, then, killing, him, the, group, was, headed, by, eleuterio, adevoso, an, official, of, the, opposition, liberal, party, a, document, given, to, the, committee, by, a, philippine, government, official, alleged, that, key, figures, in, the, plot, were, vice, president, fernando, lopez, and, sergio, osmena, jr, whom, marcos, defeated, in, the, 1969, election, while, a, report, obtained, by, the, new, york, times, speculated, that, rumors, of, a, coup, could, be, used, by, marcos, to, justify, martial, law, as, early, as, december, 1969, in, a, message, from, the, us, ambassador, to, the, us, assistant, secretary, of, state, the, ambassador, said, that, most, of, the, talk, about, revolution, and, even, assassination, has, been, coming, from, the, defeated, opposition, of, which, adevoso, is, a, leading, activist, he, also, said, that, the, information, he, has, on, the, assassination, plans, are, hard, or, well, sourced, and, he, has, to, make, sure, that, it, reaches, president, marcos, in, interviews, by, the, washington, post, unnamed, former, communist, party, of, the, philippines, officials, alleged, that, the, communist, party, leadership, planned, and, three, operatives, carried, out, the, plaza, miranda, attack, in, an, attempt, to, provoke, government, repression, and, push, the, country, to, the, brink, of, revolution, communist, party, leader, jose, maria, sison, had, calculated, that, marcos, could, be, provoked, into, cracking, down, on, his, opponents, thereby, driving, thousands, of, political, activists, into, the, underground, the, anonymous, former, officials, said, recruits, were, urgently, needed, they, said, to, make, use, of, a, large, influx, of, weapons, and, financial, aid, that, china, had, already, agreed, to, provide, jos, mar, a, sison, continues, to, deny, these, claims, and, the, cpp, has, never, released, any, official, confirmation, of, their, culpability, in, the, incident, marcos, and, his, allies, claimed, that, benigno, aquino, jr, was, part, of, the, plot, which, was, denied, by, cpp, npa, founding, chair, jose, maria, sison, some, historians, claim, marcos, was, responsible, for, the, plaza, miranda, bombing, as, he, is, known, to, have, used, false, flag, operations, as, a, pretext, for, martial, law, there, were, a, series, of, deadly, bombings, in, 1971, and, the, cia, privately, stated, that, marcos, was, responsible, for, at, least, one, of, them, us, intelligence, documents, declassified, in, the, 1990s, contained, further, evidence, implicating, marcos, provided, by, a, cia, mole, within, the, philippine, army, another, false, flag, attack, took, place, with, the, attempted, assassination, of, defense, minister, juan, ponce, enrile, in, 1972, president, nixon, approved, marcos, s, martial, law, initiative, immediately, afterwards, as, a, response, to, the, plaza, miranda, bombing, marcos, issued, proclamation, no, 889, through, which, he, assumed, emergency, powers, and, suspended, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, an, act, which, would, later, be, seen, as, a, prelude, to, the, declaration, of, martial, law, more, than, a, year, later, marcos, s, suspension, of, the, writ, became, the, event, that, forced, many, members, of, the, moderate, opposition, such, as, edgar, jopson, to, join, the, ranks, of, the, radicals, in, the, aftermath, of, the, bombing, marcos, lumped, all, of, the, opposition, together, and, referred, to, them, as, communists, and, many, former, moderates, fled, to, the, mountain, encampments, of, the, radical, opposition, to, avoid, being, arrested, by, marcos, s, forces, those, who, became, disenchanted, with, the, excesses, of, the, marcos, administration, and, wanted, to, join, the, opposition, after, 1971, often, joined, the, ranks, of, the, radicals, simply, because, they, represented, the, only, group, vocally, offering, opposition, to, the, marcos, government, on, the, evening, of, september, 23, 1972, president, ferdinand, marcos, announced, that, he, had, placed, the, entirety, of, the, philippines, under, martial, law, this, marked, the, beginning, of, a, 14, year, period, of, one, man, rule, that, would, effectively, last, until, marcos, was, exiled, from, the, country, on, february, 25, 1986, even, though, the, formal, document, proclaiming, martial, law, proclamation, no, 1081, was, formally, lifted, on, january, 17, 1981, marcos, retained, virtually, all, of, his, powers, as, dictator, until, he, was, ousted, by, the, edsa, revolution, plaza, miranda, was, soon, followed, by, a, series, of, about, twenty, explosions, that, took, place, in, various, locations, in, metro, manila, in, the, months, immediately, preceding, marcos, s, proclamation, of, martial, law, the, first, of, these, bombings, took, place, on, march, 15, 1972, and, the, last, took, place, on, september, 11, 1972, twelve, days, before, martial, law, was, announced, on, september, 23, of, that, year, the, marcos, regime, officially, attributed, the, explosions, to, communist, urban, guerillas, and, marcos, included, them, in, the, list, of, inciting, events, that, served, as, rationalizations, for, his, declaration, of, martial, law, marcos, s, political, opposition, at, the, time, questioned, the, attribution, of, the, explosions, to, the, communists, noting, that, the, only, suspects, caught, in, connection, to, the, explosions, were, linked, to, the, philippine, constabulary, the, sites, of, the, 1972, manila, bombings, included, the, palace, theater, and, joe, s, department, store, on, carriedo, street, both, in, manila, the, offices, of, the, philippine,

these, incidents, the, one, in, the, carriedo, shopping, mall, went, beyond, damage, to, property, one, woman, was, killed, and, about, 40, persons, were, injured, marcos, s, declaration, of, martial, law, became, known, to, the, public, on, september, 23, 1972, when, his, press, secretary, francisco, tatad, announced, through, the, radio, that, proclamation, 1081, which, marcos, had, supposedly, signed, two, days, earlier, on, september, 21, had, come, into, force, and, would, extend, marcos, s, rule, beyond, the, constitutional, two, term, limit, ruling, by, decree, he, almost, dissolved, press, freedom, and, other, civil, liberties, to, add, propaganda, machine, closed, down, congress, and, media, establishments, and, ordered, the, arrest, of, opposition, leaders, and, militant, activists, including, senators, benigno, aquino, jr, jovito, salonga, and, jose, w, diokno, marcos, claimed, that, martial, law, was, the, prelude, to, creating, his, bagong, lipunan, a, new, society, based, on, new, social, and, political, values, the, early, years, of, martial, law, gained, public, approval, as, it, was, believed, to, have, caused, crime, rates, to, drop, however, unlike, ninoy, aquino, s, senate, colleagues, who, were, detained, without, charges, ninoy, together, with, communist, npa, leaders, lt, corpuz, and, bernabe, buscayno, was, charged, with, murder, illegal, possession, of, firearms, and, subversion, as, one, of, his, rationalizations, for, the, declaration, of, martial, law, marcos, said, that, there, was, a, need, to, reform, society, 66, by, placing, it, under, the, control, of, a, benevolent, dictator, which, could, guide, the, undisciplined, populace, through, a, period, of, chaos, 29, he, referred, to, this, social, engineering, exercise, as, the, bagong, lipunan, or, new, society, 13, and, the, marcos, administration, produced, a, range, propaganda, materials, including, speeches, books, lectures, slogans, and, numerous, propaganda, songs, to, promote, it, 13, according, to, marcos, s, book, notes, on, the, new, society, it, was, a, movement, urging, the, poor, and, the, privileged, to, work, as, one, for, the, common, goals, of, society, and, to, achieve, the, liberation, of, the, filipino, people, through, self, realization, the, marcos, regime, instituted, a, youth, organization, known, as, the, kabataang, barangay, which,

who, would, eventually, succeed, his, father, in, the, telecommunications, company, both, happened, to, be, cousins, of, corazon, aquino, these, associates, of, marcos, then, used, these, as, fronts, to, launder, proceeds, from, institutionalized, graft, and, corruption, in, the, different, national, governmental, agencies, as, crony, capitalism, for, personal, benefit, graft, and, corruption, via, bribery, racketeering, and, embezzlement, became, more, prevalent, during, this, era, marcos, also, silenced, the, free, press, making, the, press, of, the, state, propaganda, the, only, legal, one, which, was, a, common, practice, for, governments, around, the, world, that, sought, to, fight, communism, marcos, and, his, close, rolex, 12, associates, like, juan, ponce, enrile, used, their, powers, to, settle, scores, against, old, rivals, such, as, the, lopezes, who, were, always, opposed, to, the, marcos, administration, enrile, and, the, lopezes, eugenio, lopez, sr, and, eugenio,

declaration, of, martial, law, it, was, owned, and, controlled, by, the, lopez, family, after, martial, law, was, imposed, it, became, the, prime, target, for, takeover, by, the, marcos, romualdez, family, among, the, first, things, the, clan, did, was, to, arrest, the, eldest, son, of, eugenio, lopez, sr, the, major, stockholder, of, meralco, for, allegedly, plotting, the, assassination, of, ferdinand, marcos, in, the, years, 1973, 1974, the, organization, of, petroleum, exporting, countries, opec, started, applying, the, oil, prize, squeeze, as, a, public, utility, that, supplies, power,

was, pushed, to, the, edge, of, massive, defaults, in, loans, it, was, here, that, the, marcos, romualdez, clan, stepped, in, according, to, eugenio, lopez, sr, he, was, promised, the, release, of, his, eldest, son, from, prison, in, exchange, for, the, sale, of, his, control, in, meralco, to, the, marcos, romualdez, group, after, several, months, of, negotiations, and, with, the, increasing, loan, defaults, mr, lopez, conceded, defeat, he, even, died, without, seeing, his, son, eugenio, jr, released, from, the, marcos, martial, law, prison, after, the, marcos, romualdez, takeover, the,

allowed, to, raise, electricity, rates, meralco, was, also, exempted, from, paying, the, duty, of, oil, imports, which, is, a, form, of, indirect, subsidy, it, should, share, with, poor, consumers, massive, foreign, loans, enabled, marcos, to, build, more, schools, hospitals, and, infrastructure, than, all, of, his, predecessors, combined, but, crippled, the, philippine, economy, today, according, to, ibon, foundation, filipino, citizens, are, still, bearing, the, heavy, burden, of, servicing, public, debts, incurred, during, marcos, s, administration, with, ongoing, interest, payments, on, the, loan, schedule, by, the, philippine, government, estimated, to, last, until, 2025, 59, years, after, marcos, assumed, office, and, 39, years, after, he, was, deposed, corazon, aquino, had, an, opportunity, to, default, and, not, pay, foreign, debt, incurred, during, the, marcos, administration, however, due, to, finance, secretary, jaime, ongpin, s, warning, on, the, consequences, of, a, debt, default, which, includes, isolating, the, country, from, the, international, financial, community, and, hampering, the, economic, recovery, corazon, aquino, honored, all, the, debts, incurred, during, the, marcos, administration, contrary, to, expectations, of, left, learning, organizations, such, as, ibon, foundation, that, advocated, for, non, payment, of, debt, jaime, ongpin, who, is, a, brother, of, marcos, trade, minister, roberto, ongpin, was, later, dismissed, by, cory, aquino, and, later, died, in, an, apparent, suicide, after, he, had, been, depressed, about, infighting, in, aquino, s, cabinet, and, disappointed, that, the, people, power, uprising, which, had, toppled, dictator, ferdinand, marcos, had, not, brought, significant, change, marcos, projected, himself, to, the, philippine, public, as, having, spent, a, lot, on, construction, projects, and, his, record, upholds, that, reputation, 128, a, 2011, study, by, university, of, the, philippines, school, of, economics, indicated, that, at, the, time, of, the, study, marcos, was, the, president, that, spent, the, most, on, infrastructure, not, just, because, he, stayed, in, power, for, nearly, two, and, a, half, decades, but, in, terms, of, actual, per, year, spending, by, the, time, of, the, study, marcos, had, only, been, outspent, in, infrastructure, building, for, a, period, of, one, year, during, the, term, of, fidel, ramos, these, included, hospitals, like, the, philippine, heart, center, lung, center, and, kidney, center, transportation, infrastructure, like, san, juanico, bridge, formerly, marcos, bridge, pan, philippine, highway, north, luzon, expressway, south, luzon, expressway, and, manila, light, rail, transit, lrt, cultural, and, heritage, sites, like, the, cultural, center, of, the, philippines, nayong, pilipino, philippine, international, convention, center, and, the, disastrous, and, ill, fated, manila, film, center, were, built, as, well, this, focus, on, infrastructure, which, critics, saw, as, a, propaganda, technique, eventually, earned, the, colloquial, label, edifice, complex, most, of, these, infrastructure, projects, and, monuments, were, paid, for, using, foreign, currency, loans, and, at, great, taxpayer, cost, 89, this, greatly, increased, the, philippines, foreign, deficit, from, 360, million, when, marcos, became, president, to, around, 28, 3, billion, when, he, was, overthrown, the, marcos, administration, s, spending, on, construction, projects, expanded, even, more, with, the, construction, of, prominent, building, projects, mostly, meant, to, build, up, imelda, marcos, s, power, base, within, the, administration, by, projecting, her, as, a, patroness, of, the, arts, 169, this, shift, in, the, prioritization, of, projects, was, so, significant, that, by, 1977, 1980, projects, in, the, conspicuous, capital, outlays, category, had, ballooned, to, 20, of, the, philippines, capital, outlays, up, from, a, negligible, percentage, at, the, beginning, of, the, marcos, administration, 88, 89, critics, contrasted, this, with, the, fact, that, poverty, in, the, countryside, was, a, much, more, pressing, economic, issue, of, the, time, in, addition, imelda, s, edifice, complex, projects, were, typically, constructed, on, a, rush, basis, 169, resulting, in, some, of, them, not, being, safe, for, long, term, use, the, following, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, most, controversial, projects, constructed, during, the, marcos, era, the, ccp, complex, is, a, 77, hectare, reclaimed, property, in, pasay, designed, by, leandro, locsin, it, includes, the, ccp, main, building, the, folk, arts, theater, the, philippine, international, convention, center, the, manila, film, center, and, the, coconut, palace, also, called, the, tahanang, pilipino, it, was, established, as, a, result, of, ferdinand, marcos, s, issuance, of, executive, order, no, 30, s, 1966, which, stated, that, the, preservation, and, promotion, of, philippine, culture, in, all, its, varied, aspects, and, phases, is, a, vital, concern, of, the, state, following, this, issuance, he, appointed, a, seven, member, board, of, trustees, who, then, unanimously, elected, imelda, marcos, as, its, chair, on, september, 8, 1969, the, ccp, main, building, was, inaugurated, as, the, country, s, premier, arts, institution, the, inauguration, was, originally, set, in, january, 1969, but, was, postponed, because, funds, were, running, out, from, campaign, overspending, the, projected, budget, for, the, construction, of, ccp, was, p15, million, but, by, december, 1968, the, cost, had, already, reached, p48, million, and, the, construction, was, not, even, complete, yet, because, of, this, imelda, marcos, loaned, 7, million, from, the, national, investment, development, corporation, to, finance, the, remaining, amount, by, 1972, debt, for, the, construction, of, the, theater, alone, has, reached, p63, million, the, san, juanico, bridge, is, part, of, the, pan, philippine, highway, and, links, the, provinces, of, leyte, and, samar, through, tacloban, city, and, santa, rita, samar, having, a, total, length, of, 2, 16, kilometres, 1, 34, mi, it, is, the, longest, bridge, over, a, body, of, water, in, the, philippines, it, is, said, to, be, ferdinand, marcos, s, gift, to, his, wife, imelda, whose, hometown, was, leyte, construction, of, the, bridge, began, in, 1969, it, was, inaugurated, on, july, 2, 1973, in, time, for, imelda, marcos, s, birthday, the, cost, of, the, construction, reached, 22, million, and, was, acquired, through, the, japanese, official, development, assistance, loans, at, the, time, the, project, was, conceived, there, was, not, a, need, yet, for, a, bridge, that, connects, leyte, and, samar, for, both, of, these, provinces, were, still, relatively, underdeveloped, there, was, not, enough, traffic, between, these, two, islands, to, warrant, a, bridge, to, be, constructed, there, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, san, juanico, bridge, remains, to, be, one, of, the, costliest, white, elephant, projects, during, the, marcos, era, construction, of, the, manila, film, center, began, in, january, 1981, and, was, spearheaded, by, imelda, marcos, it, cost, 25, million, construction, work, was, compressed, to, just, 10, months, so, it, could, be, used, as, a, venue, for, the, first, manila, international, film, festival, scheduled, on, january, 18, 1982, to, meet, the, deadline, around, 4, 000, workers, were, employed, to, work, three, 24, hour, nonstop, shifts, the, lobby, which, would, normally, take, 6, weeks, to, finish, was, constructed, in, 72, hours, by, 1, 000, workers, as, a, result, of, the, rushed, construction, a, scaffolding, collapsed, on, a, group, of, workers, on, november, 17, 1981, two, months, before, the, deadline, despite, the, accident, work, continued, and, the, bodies, of, the, workers, were, buried, in, cement, rescuers, and, ambulances, were, only, permitted, to, enter, the, site, 9, hours, after, the, incident, following, the, tragedy, then, prime, minister, cesar, virata, disapproved, the, 5, million, subsidy, which, was, intended, for, the, film, festival, the, expenses, incurred, during, opening, night, and, the, film, center, s, operations, ended, up, being, shouldered, by, the, bangko, sentral, ng, pilipinas, then, the, central, bank, marcos, s, signature, agricultural, program, masagana, 99, was, thus, launched, on, may, 21, 1973, as, an, effort, to, address, a, nationwide, rice, shortage, arising, from, the, various, natural, disasters, and, pest, infestations, in, 1972, its, goal, was, to, promote, philippine, rice, self, sufficiency, by, raising, the, philippines, average, palay, crop, yield, from, 40, cavans, per, hectare, to, 99, cavans, 4, 4, tons, per, hectare, the, program, planned, to, achieve, this, by, pushing, farmers, to, use, newly, developed, technologies, including, high, yielding, variety, hyv, seeds, low, cost, fertilizer, and, herbicides, masagana, 99, also, included, a, supervised, credit, scheme, which, was, supposed, to, provide, farmers, with, the, funds, needed, to, pay, for, the, program, s, technology, package, the, central, bank, designed, subsidized, rediscounting, facilities, for, public, and, private, credit, institutions, throughout, the, country, encouraging, them, to, give, loans, to, farmers, without, collateral, or, other, usual, borrowing, requirements, the, program, achieved, initial, success, by, encouraging, farmers, to, plant, new, miracle, rice, ir8, variety, of, rice, which, the, rockefeller, and, ford, foundations, and, the, up, college, of, agriculture, through, the, international, rice, research, institute, irri, in, los, ba, os, laguna, 7, had, been, developing, since, 1962, during, the, administration, of, president, carlos, p, garcia, while, this, rise, of, industrialized, chemical, agriculture, to, the, philippines, resulted, in, annual, rice, production, in, the, philippines, increasing, from, 3, 7, to, 7, 7, million, tons, in, two, decades, and, made, the, philippines, a, rice, exporter, for, the, first, time, in, the, 20th, century, the, switch, to, ir8, required, more, fertilizers, and, pesticides, this, and, other, related, reforms, resulted, in, high, profits, for, transnational, corporations, but, were, generally, harmful, to, small, peasant, farmers, who, were, often, pushed, into, poverty, economists, generally, acknowledge, masagana, 99, to, have, failed, because, the, supervised, credit, scheme, it, offered, to, farmers, proved, unsustainable, the, program, is, said, to, have, catered, to, rich, landowners, and, has, been, criticized, for, leaving, poor, farmers, in, debt, and, for, having, become, a, vehicle, of, political, patronage, 20, although, masagana, 99, showed, promising, results, the, years, from, 1965, to, 1986, showed, a, complete, paradox, of, events, the, income, per, capita, rose, the, economy, was, growing, yet, people, were, impoverished, the, american, economist, james, k, boyce, calls, this, phenomenon, immiserizing, growth, when, economic, growth, and, political, and, social, conditions, are, such, that, the, rich, get, absolutely, richer, and, the, poor, become, absolutely, poorer, from, 1972, to, 1980, agricultural, production, fell, by, 30, after, declaring, martial, law, in, 1972, marcos, promised, to, implement, agrarian, reforms, however, the, land, reforms, served, largely, to, undermine, marcos, s, landholder, opponents, not, to, lessen, inequality, in, the, countryside, and, encouraged, conversion, to, cash, tenancy, and, greater, reliance, on, farm, workers, while, the, book, claimed, that, agricultural, production, declined, by, 30, in, the, 1970s, and, suggested, that, timber, exports, were, growing, in, the, same, period, an, article, published, by, the, world, bank, on, philippine, agriculture, says, that, crops, rice, corn, coconut, sugar, livestock, and, poultry, and, fisheries, grew, at, an, average, rate, of, 6, 8, 3, and, 4, 5, respectively, from, 1970, to, 1980, and, the, forestry, sector, actually, declined, by, an, annual, average, rate, of, 4, 4, through, the, 1970s, the, marcos, administration, marked, a, period, of, intense, logging, exportation, with, commercial, logging, accounting, for, 5, of, the, gross, national, product, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1970s, this, was, the, result, of, intense, demand, created, by, a, construction, boom, in, japan, timber, products, became, one, of, the, nation, s, top, exports, but, little, attention, was, paid, to, the, environmental, impacts, of, deforestation, as, cronies, never, complied, with, reforestation, agreements, by, the, early, 1980s, forestry, collapsed, because, most, of, the, philippines, accessible, forests, had, been, depleted, of, the, 12, million, hectares, of, forestland, about, 7, million, had, been, left, barren, this, was, such, a, severe, drop, in, the, philippines, forest, cover, that, most, philippine, logging, companies, had, transferred, their, operations, to, sarawak, and, other, nearby, areas, by, the, 1980s, 117, data, from, the, philippines, forest, management, bureau, indicates, that, the, rate, of, forest, destruction, in, the, philippines, was, about, 300, 000, hectares, 740, 000, acres, per, year, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, such, that, by, 1981, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, classified, 2, million, hectares, of, philippine, forests, severely, degraded, and, incapable, of, regeneration, in, 1979, marcos, put, a, range, of, 11, heavy, industrialization, projects, on, the,

during, the, marcos, administration, included, 17, hydroelectric, and, geothermal, power, plants, to, lessen, the, country, s, dependency, on, oil, with, the, commissioning, of, the, tongonan, 1, and, palinpinon, 1, geothermal, plants, in, 1983, the, philippines, became, the, second, largest, producer, of, geothermal, power, in, the, world, the, philippine, economy, began, to, go, in, decline, in, 1981, because, of, excessive, debt, however, and, finally, went, into, a, tailspin, in, 1984, this, resulted, in, the, closure, of, factories, massive, layoffs, and, the, end, of, work, on, marcos, s, industrialization, projects, until, he, was, finally, deposed, two, years, later, the, bataan, nuclear, power, plant, bnpp, is, one, of, the, six, nuclear, power, plants, that, the, marcos, regime, planned, to, build, it, stands, in, morong, bataan, atop, napot, point, that, overlooks, the, south, china, sea, construction, of, the, bnpp, began, in, 1976, and, was, completed, in, 1985, controversy, surrounding, the, bnpp, began, well, after, its, construction, in, 1974, national, power, was, already, negotiating, with, general, electric, to, get, the, order, however, westinghouse, another, energy, company, hired, a, lobbyist, herminio, disini, a, friend, of, ferdinand, marcos, using, disini, s, close, ties, to, marcos, westinghouse, made, a, direct, offer, to, marcos, and, his, cabinet, to, supply, a, plant, with, two, 620, mw, reactors, at, a, base, price, of, 500, million, the, estimated, total, price, was, raised, to, around, 650, million, because, of, other, charges, like, fuel, and, transmission, lines, soon, after, the, negotiations, with, general, electric, were, scrapped, and, westinghouse, won, the, deal, by, march, 1975, westinghouse, s, contract, price, increased, to, 1, 1, billion, for, interest, and, escalation, costs, there, were, numerous, issues, regarding, its, safety, and, usability, after, the, three, mile, island, incident, in, the, united, states, construction, of, the, nuclear, power, plant, was, stopped, a, safety, inquiry, was, done, subsequently, which, revealed, over, 4, 000, defects, the, site, chosen, for, the, nuclear, plant, was, also, dangerous, as, it, was, built, near, the, open, sea, and, the, then, dormant, mount, pinatubo, and, was, within, 25, miles, of, three, geological, faults, the, nuclear, plant, was, discontinued, in, 1986, following, the, chernobyl, disaster, its, goal, of, generating, 620, mw, of, electricity, was, never, achieved, its, cost, reached, over, 2, 3, million, and, was, only, paid, off, by, the, government, in, april, 2017, 31, years, after, the, beginning, of, its, construction, however, government, spending, for, the, bnpp, continues, long, after, that, maintaining, the, plant, costs, the, government, p40, million, a, year, in, 2011, the, government, had, to, reimburse, p4, 2, billion, to, national, power, corporation, for, the, plant, s, maintenance, to, contribute, to, the, cost, of, its, maintenance, it, was, transformed, into, a, tourist, attraction, recognizing, the, value, filipino, culture, placed, on, education, marcos, emphasized, the, construction, of, educational, infrastructure, as, early, as, during, his, first, presidential, term, by, being, more, willing, than, those, previous, presidents, to, use, foreign, loans, to, fund, construction, projects, he, was, able, to, achieve, construct, more, roads, and, schoolbuildings, than, any, previous, administration, 128, 47, of, the, philippines, state, colleges, and, universities, were, established, during, marcos, s, 21, year, administration, two, of, these, the, mariano, marcos, state, university, in, ilocos, norte, and, the, don, mariano, marcos, memorial, state, university, in, la, union, were, named, after, marcos, s, father, mariano, the, philippine, education, system, underwent, two, major, periods, of, restructuring, under, the, marcos, administration, first, in, 1972, as, part, of, the, ideology, of, the, bagong, lipunan, new, society, alongside, the, declaration, of, martial, law, and, second, in, 1981, when, the, fourth, philippine, republic, was, established, the, 1972, restructuring, marked, the, first, major, restructuring, of, philippine, education, since, the, arrival, of, the, americans, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, it, reoriented, the, teaching, of, civics, and, history, so, that, it, would, reflect, values, that, supported, the, bagong, lipunan, and, its, ideology, of, constitutional, authoritarianism, 414, in, addition, it, attempted, to, synchronize, the, educational, curriculum, with, the, administration, s, economic, strategy, of, labor, export, changes, sought, by, the, second, restructuring, in, 1981, was, not, extensively, implemented, as, the, administration, was, stymied, by, economic, crises, and, was, eventually, deposed, in, 1975, marcos, issued, presidential, decree, no, 824, placing, the, four, cities, and, thirteen, municipalities, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, the, province, of, manila, under, the, administration, of, the, metro, manila, commission, mmc, which, would, serve, as, the, central, government, of, the, capital, the, head, of, the, mmc, was, called, a, governor, but, the, position, was, an, appointive, rather, than, an, elected, one, marcos, appointed, his, wife, imelda, marcos, as, governor, the, governorship, of, metro, manila, was, the, second, most, powerful, office, in, the, republic, given, that, metro, manila, accounts, for, around, 20, of, the, country, s, population, it, is, estimated, to, be, responsible, for, at, least, 70, of, gross, national, receipts, it, is, the, seat, of, the, national, government, and, some, 90, of, the, national, government, s, offices, and, instrumentalities, are, located, within, its, environs, its, budget, is, second, to, the, national, government, this, increase, in, imelda, s, political, power, was, so, dramatic, that, it, led, former, un, general, assembly, president, carlos, p, romulo, to, describe, her, as, the, philippines, de, facto, vice, president, the, country, crafted, a, large, number, of, decrees, laws, and, edicts, during, marcos, s, term, from, 1972, to, 1986, the, marcos, administration, codified, laws, through, 2, 036, presidential, decrees, an, average, of, 145, per, year, during, the, 14, year, period, to, put, this, into, context, only, 14, 12, and, 11, laws, were, passed, in, 2015, 2014, and, 2013, respectively, a, large, number, of, the, laws, passed, during, the, term, of, marcos, remain, in, force, today, and, are, embedded, in, the, country, s, legal, system, according, to, imee, marcos, in, 2006, many, of, the, thousands, of, proclamations, decrees, and, executive, orders, marcos, issued, were, still, in, force, and, few, have, been, repealed, revoked, modified, or, amended, many, people, who, rose, to, power, during, marcos, s, 21, years, as, president, continued, to, remain, in, power, or, even, ascended, higher, after, his, exile, thus, leaving, a, further, imprint, on, present, day, filipino, affairs, one, of, these, was, fidel, ramos, a, general, promoted, by, marcos, who, supervised, many, terror, killings, and, tortures, who, later, switched, sides, and, subsequently, became, president, himself, through, free, elections, all, five, american, presidents, from, 1965, to, 1985, were, unwilling, to, jeopardize, the, us, marcos, relationship, mainly, to, protect, and, retain, access, of, the, us, military, bases, in, the, philippines, however, at, the, same, time, for, the, us, the, philippines, was, just, one, of, its, many, allies, and, for, the, philippines, the, us, was, its, only, patron, therefore, marcos, worked, to, identify, himself, closely, with, the, us, in, order, to, secure, a, strong, bargaining, position, with, their, government, indeed, he, had, manipulated, this, american, connection, to, sustain, him, during, his, two, decades, of, power, us, support, was, believed, to, be, the, only, reason, why, marcos, remained, in, power, over, his, term, marcos, was, able, to, strengthen, his, ties, to, the, us, government, johnson, received, two, engineer, battalions, bought, with, the, philippine, s, american, aid, as, a, form, of, philippines, military, participation, in, the, vietnam, war, after, the, fall, of, south, vietnam, gerald, ford, demanded, better, security, assistance, from, allies, such, as, the, philippines, while, carter, wanted, to, retain, the, us, military, bases, in, the, philippines, to, project, military, power, in, the, indian, ocean, to, guard, the, west, s, oil, supply, line, from, the, middle, east, all, of, which, marcos, granted, to, obtain, additional, aid, marcos, often, leveraged, on, threats, that, caught, the, attention, of, the, us, government, to, secure, additional, aid, for, his, campaign, marcos, threatened, to, search, every, visiting, american, naval, vessel, the, us, responded, by, assisting, his, campaign, indirectly, injecting, several, million, dollars, into, the, government, banking, system, in, another, instance, when, the, issues, of, military, bases, heated, up, in, the, philippines, during, 1969, marcos, secretly, assured, the, us, he, had, no, desire, for, an, american, withdrawal, yet, he, received, warnings, from, the, philippine, embassy, in, washington, that, provisions, should, now, be, made, in, anticipation, of, a, possible, phasing, out, or, minimization, of, us, aid, to, the, republic, of, the, philippines, both, for, military, aid, and, non, military, items, considering, the, evolving, temper, of, the, american, congress, afraid, marcos, began, to, suggests, threats, again, in, one, of, his, presidential, speeches, he, stated, that, the, bases, were, a, threat, to, regional, peace, and, security, while, reminding, the, united, states, of, its, solemn, obligation, to, continue, aid, he, warned, that, the, bases, could, imperil, more, than, they, serve, our, interests, in, the, last, weeks, of, the, ford, administration, marcos, had, rejected, the, us, compensation, kissinger, s, package, of, 1, billion, in, mixed, grants, and, loans, for, being, too, small, a, number, of, books, were, published, under, marcos, s, name, during, his, term, from, 1970, to, 1983, and, a, final, book, was, published, in, 1990, posthumously, those, published, during, his, term, are, believed, to, have, been, written, by, ghostwriters, notably, adrian, cristobal, marcos, and, his, wife, imelda, were, jointly, credited, in, 1989, by, guinness, world, records, with, the, largest, ever, theft, from, a, government, an, estimated, 5, billion, to, 10, billion, us, dollars, a, record, they, still, hold, today, business, sector, opposition, political, sector, opposition, religious, sector, opposition, student, activists, reform, the, armed, forces, movement, others, who, withdrew, support,
