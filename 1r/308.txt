and, though, it, earned, him, a, few, respectable, reviews, the, book, sold, poorly, heavily, influenced, by, kerouac, s, reading, of, thomas, wolfe, it, reflects, on, the, generational, epic, formula, and, the, contrasts, of, small, town, life, versus, the, multi, dimensional, and, larger, life, of, the, city, the, book, was, heavily, edited, by, robert, giroux, with, around, 400, pages, taken, out, for, the, next, six, years, kerouac, continued, to, write, regularly, building, upon, previous, drafts, tentatively, titled, the, beat, generation, and, gone, on, the, road, he, completed,

prose, kerouac, wrote, the, final, draft, in, 20, days, with, joan, his, wife, supplying, him, with, benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls, of, pea, soup, and, mugs, of, coffee, to, keep, him, going, before, beginning, kerouac, cut, sheets, of, tracing, paper, into, long, strips, wide, enough, for, a, typewriter, and, taped, them, together, into, a, 120, foot, 37, m, long, roll, which, he, then, fed, into, the, machine, this, allowed, him, to, type, continuously, without, the, interruption, of, reloading, pages, the, resulting, manuscript, contained, no, chapter, or, paragraph, breaks, and, was, much, more, explicit, than, the, version, which, was, eventually, published, though, spontaneous, kerouac, had, prepared, long, in, advance, before, beginning, to, write, in, fact, according, to, his, columbia, professor, and, mentor, mark, van, doren, he, had, outlined, much, of, the, work, in, his, journals, over, the, several, preceding, years, though, the, work, was, completed, quickly, kerouac, had, a, long, and, difficult, time, finding, a, publisher, before, on, the, road, was, accepted, by, viking, press, kerouac, got, a, job, as, a, railroad, brakeman, and, fire, lookout, see, desolation, peak, washington, traveling, between, the, east, and, west, coasts, of, the, united, states, to, earn, money, frequently, finding, rest, and, the, quiet, space, necessary, for, writing, at, the, home, of, his, mother, while, employed, in, this, way, he, met, and, befriended, abe, green, a, young, freight, train, jumper, who, later, introduced, kerouac, to, herbert, huncke, a, times, square, street, hustler, and, favorite, of, many, beat, generation, writers, according, to, kerouac, on, the, road, was, really, a, story, about, two, catholic, buddies, roaming, the, country, in, search, of, god, and, we, found, him, i, found, him, in, the, sky, in, market, street, san, francisco, those, 2, visions, and, dean, neal, had, god, sweating, out, of, his, forehead, all, the, way, there, is, no, other, way, out, for, the, holy, man, he, must, sweat, for, god, and, once, he, has, found, him, the, godhood, of, god, is, forever, established, and, really, must, not, be, spoken, about, according, to, his, biographer, historian, douglas, brinkley, on, the, road, has, been, misinterpreted, as, a, tale, of, companions, out, looking, for, kicks, but, the, most, important, thing, to, comprehend, is, that, kerouac, was, an, american, catholic, author, for, example, virtually, every, page, of, his, diary, bore, a, sketch, of, a, crucifix, a, prayer, or, an, appeal, to, christ, to, be, forgiven, in, the, spring, of, 1951, while, pregnant, joan, haverty, left, and, divorced, kerouac, in, february, 1952, she, gave, birth, to, kerouac, s, only, child, jan, kerouac, whom, he,

enemies, on, both, sides, of, the, political, spectrum, the, right, disdaining, his, association, with, drugs, and, sexual, libertinism, and, the, left, contemptuous, of, his, anti, communism, and, catholicism, characteristically, he, watched, the, 1954, senate, mccarthy, hearings, smoking, marijuana, and, rooting, for, the, anti, communist, crusader, senator, joseph, mccarthy, in, desolation, angels, he, wrote, when, i, went, to, columbia, all, they, tried, to, teach, us, was, marx, as, if, i, cared, considering, marxism, like, freudianism, to, be, an, illusory, tangent, in, 1957, after, being, rejected, by, several, other, publishers, on, the, road, was, finally, purchased, by, viking, press, which, demanded, major, revisions, prior, to, publication, many, of, the, most, sexually, explicit, passages, were, removed, and, fearing, libel, suits, pseudonyms, were, used, for, the, book, s, characters, these, revisions, have, often, led, to, criticisms, of, the, alleged, spontaneity,

generation, was, invented, by, kerouac, during, a, conversation, held, with, fellow, novelist, herbert, huncke, huncke, used, the, term, beat, to, describe, a, person, with, little, money, and, few, prospects, kerouac, s, fame, came, as, an, unmanageable, surge, that, would, ultimately, be, his, undoing, kerouac, s, novel, is, often, described, as, the, defining, work, of, the, post, world, war,

teachers, ruth, fuller, sasaki, and, alan, watts, he, wrote, to, snyder, referring, to, a, meeting, with, d, t, suzuki, that, even, suzuki, was, looking, at, me, through, slitted, eyes, as, though, i, was, a, monstrous, imposter, he, passed, up, the, opportunity, to, reunite, with, snyder, in, california, and, explained, to, philip, whalen, i, d, be, ashamed, to, confront, you, and, gary, now, i,

and, ends, with, footage, of, kerouac, reading, from, on, the, road, and, visions, of, cody, on, the, steve, allen, show, in, november, 1959, in, response, to, allen, s, question, how, would, you,

gwernig, used, to, translate, his, breton, language, poems, into, english, so, that, kerouac, could, read, and, understand, them, meeting, with, jack, kerouac, in, 1965, for, instance, was, a, decisive, turn, since, he, could, not, speak, breton, he, asked, me, would, you, not, write, some, of, your, poems, in, english, i, d, really, like, to, read, them, so, i, wrote, an, diri, dir, stairs, of, steel, for, him, and, kept, on, doing, so, that, s, why, i, often, write, my, poems, in, breton, french, and, english, during, these, years, kerouac, suffered, the, loss, of, his, older, sister, to, a, heart, attack, in, 1964, and, his, mother, suffered, a, paralyzing, stroke, in, 1966, kerouac, moved, in, with, his, mother, in, hyannis, massachusetts, for, almost, a, year, in, 1966, in, 1968, neal, cassady, also, died, while, in, mexico, despite, the, role, which, his, literary, work, played, in, inspiring, the, counterculture, movement, of, the, 1960s, kerouac, was, openly, critical, of, it, arguments, over, the, movement, which, kerouac, believed, was, only, an, excuse, to, be, spiteful, also, resulted, in, him, splitting, with, ginsberg, by, 1968, also, in, 1968, kerouac, last, appeared, on, television, for, firing, line, produced, and, hosted, by, william, f, buckley, jr, a, friend, of, his, from, college, seemingly, intoxicated, he, affirmed, his,

hemorrhage, he, received, several, transfusions, in, an, attempt, to, make, up, for, the, loss, of, blood, and, doctors, subsequently, attempted, surgery, but, a, damaged, liver, prevented, his, blood, from, clotting, he, never, regained, consciousness, after, the, operation, and, died, at, the, hospital, at, 5, 15, the, following, morning, at, the, age, of, 47, his, cause, of, death, was, listed, as, an, internal, hemorrhage, bleeding, esophageal, varices, caused, by, cirrhosis, the, result, of, longtime, alcohol, abuse, a, possible, contributing, factor, was, an, untreated, hernia, he, suffered, in, a, bar, fight, several, weeks, earlier, his, funeral, was, held, at, st, jean, baptiste, church, in, lowell, massachusetts, and, he, was, buried, at, edson, cemetery, at, the, time, of, his, death, kerouac, was, living, with, his, third, wife, stella, sampas, kerouac, his, mother, gabrielle, inherited, most, of, his, estate, kerouac, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, father, of, the, beat, movement, although, he, actively, disliked, such, labels, kerouac, s, method, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, prolific, explosion, of, jazz, especially, the, bebop, genre, established, by, charlie, parker, dizzy, gillespie, thelonious, monk, and, others, later, he, included, ideas, he, developed, from, his, buddhist, studies, that, began, with, gary, snyder, he, often, referred, to, his, style, as, spontaneous, prose, although, kerouac, s, prose, was, spontaneous, and, purportedly, without, edits, he, primarily, wrote, autobiographical, novels, or, roman, clef, based, upon, actual, events, from, his, life, and, the, people, with, whom, he, interacted, this, approach, is, reflected, also, by, his, plot, structure, his, narratives, were, not, heavily, focused, on, traditional, plot, structures, instead, his, works, often, revolved, around, a, series, of, episodic, encounters, road, trips, and, personal, reflections, the, emphasis, was, on, the, characters, experiences, and, the, exploration, of, themes, such, as, freedom, rebellion, and, the, search, for, meaning, many, of, his, books, exemplified, this, spontaneous, approach, including, on, the, road, visions, of, cody, visions, of, gerard, big, sur, and, the, subterraneans, the, central, features, of, this, writing, method, were, the, ideas, of, breath, borrowed, from, jazz, and, from, buddhist, meditation, breathing, improvising, words, over, the, inherent, structures, of, mind, and, language, and, limited, revision, connected, with, this, idea, of, breath, was, the, elimination, of, the, period, substituting, instead, a, long, connecting, dash, as, such, the, phrases, occurring, between, dashes, might, resemble, improvisational, jazz, licks, when, spoken, the, words, take, on, a, certain, musical, rhythm, and, tempo, kerouac, greatly, admired, and, was, influenced, by, gary, snyder, the, dharma, bums, contains, accounts, of, a, mountain, climbing, trip, kerouac, took, with, snyder, and, includes, excerpts, of, letters, from, snyder, while, living, with, snyder, outside, mill, valley, california, in, 1956, kerouac, worked, on, a, book, about, him, which, he, considered, calling, visions, of, gary, this, eventually, became, dharma, bums, which, kerouac, described, as, mostly, about, that, summer, kerouac, took, a, job, as, a, fire, lookout, on, desolation, peak, in, the, north, cascades, in, washington, after, hearing, snyder, s, and, whalen, s, stories, of, working, as, fire, spotters, kerouac, described, the, experience, in, desolation, angels, and, later, in, alone, on, a, mountaintop, published, in, lonesome, traveler, and, the, dharma, bums, kerouac, would, go, on, for, hours, often, drunk, to, friends, and, strangers, about, his, method, allen, ginsberg, initially, unimpressed, would, later, be, one, of, his, great, proponents, and, it, was, kerouac, s, free, flowing, prose, method, that, inspired, the, composition, of, ginsberg, s, poem, howl, it, was, at, about, the, time, of, the, subterraneans, that, he, was, encouraged, by, ginsberg, and, others, to, formally, explain, his, style, of, his, expositions, of, the, spontaneous, prose, method, the, most, concise, was, belief, and, technique, for, modern, prose, a, list, of, 30, essential, maxims, and, i, shambled, after, as, usual, as, i, ve, been, doing, all, my, life, after, people, who, interest, me, because, the, only, people, for, me, are, the, mad, ones, the, ones, who, are, mad, to, live, mad, to, talk, mad, to, be, saved, desirous, of, everything, at, the, same, time, the, ones, who, never, yawn, or, say, a, commonplace, thing, but, burn, burn, burn, like, fabulous, yellow, roman, candles, exploding, like, spiders, across, the, stars, and, in, the, middle, you, see, the, blue, centerlight, pop, and, everybody, goes, awww, on, the, road, some, believed, that, at, times, kerouac, s, writing, technique, did, not, produce, lively, or, energetic, prose, truman, capote, said, of, it, that, s, not, writing, it, s, typing, according, to, carolyn, cassady, and, others, he, constantly, rewrote, and, revised, his, work, although, the, body, of, kerouac, s, work, has, been, published, in, english, in, addition, to, his, poetry, and, letters, to, friends, and, family, he, also, wrote, unpublished, works, of, fiction, in, french, the, existence, of, his, two, novels, written, in, french, la, nuit, est, ma, femme, and, sur, le, chemin, was, revealed, to, the, general, public, in, a, series, of, articles, published, by, journalist, gabriel, anctil, in, the, montreal, newspaper, le, devoir, in, 2007, and, 2008, all, these, works, including, la, nuit, est, ma, femme, sur, le, chemin, and, large, sections, of, maggie, cassidy, originally, written, in, french, have, now, been, published, together, in, a, volume, entitled, la, vie, est, d, hommage, bor, al, 2016, edited, by, university, of, pennsylvania, professor, jean, christophe, cloutier, in, 1996, the, nouvelle, revue, fran, aise, had, already, published, excerpts, and, an, article, on, la, nuit, est, ma, femme, and, scholar, paul, maher, jr, in, his, biography, kerouac, his, life, and, work, discussed, sur, le, chemin, the, novella, completed, in, five, days, in, mexico, during, december, 1952, is, a, telling, example, of, kerouac, s, attempts, at, writing, in, his, first, language, a, language, he, often, called, canuck, french, kerouac, refers, to, this, short, novel, in, a, letter, addressed, to, neal, cassady, who, is, commonly, known, as, the, inspiration, for, the, character, dean, moriarty, dated, january, 10, 1953, the, published, novel, runs, over, 110, pages, having, been, reconstituted, from, six, distinct, files, in, the, kerouac, archive, by, professor, cloutier, set, in, 1935, mostly, on, the, east, coast, it, explores, some, of, the, recurring, themes, of, kerouac, s, literature, by, way, of, a, spoken, word, narrative, here, as, with, most, of, his, french, writings, kerouac, writes, with, little, regard, for, grammar, or, spelling, often, relying, on, phonetics, in, order, to, render, an, authentic, reproduction, of, the, french, canadian, vernacular, even, though, this, work, has, the, same, title, as, one, of, his, best, known, english, novels, it, is, the, original, french, version, of, an, incomplete, translation, that, later, became, old, bull, in, the, bowery, now, published, in, the, unknown, kerouac, from, the, library, of, america, the, unknown, kerouac, edited, by, todd, tietchen, includes, cloutier, s, translation, of, la, nuit, est, ma, femme, and, the, completed, translation, of, sur, le, chemin, under, the, title, old, bull, in, the, bowery, la, nuit, est, ma, femme, was, written, in, early, 1951, and, completed, a, few, days, or, weeks, before, he, began, the, original, english, version, of, on, the, road, as, many, scholars, such, as, paul, maher, jr, joyce, johnson, hassan, melehy, and, gabriel, anctil, have, pointed, out, kerouac, s, early, writing, particularly, his, first, novel, the, town, and, the, city, was, more, conventional, and, bore, the, strong, influence, of, thomas, wolfe, the, technique, kerouac, developed, that, later, gained, him, notoriety, was, heavily, influenced, by, jazz, especially, bebop, and, later, buddhism, as, well, as, the, joan, anderson, letter, written, by, neal, cassady, the, diamond, sutra, was, the, most, important, buddhist, text, for, kerouac, and, probably, one, of, the, three, or, four, most, influential, things, he, ever, read, in, 1955, he, began, an, intensive, study, of, this, sutra, in, a, repeating, weekly, cycle, devoting, one, day, to, each, of, the, six, p, ramit, s, and, the, seventh, to, the, concluding, passage, on, sam, dhi, this, was, his, sole, reading, on, desolation, peak, and, he, hoped, by, this, means, to, condition, his, mind, to, emptiness, and, possibly, to, have, a, vision, james, joyce, was, also, a, literary, influence, on, kerouac, and, alludes, to, joyce, s, work, more, than, any, other, author, kerouac, had, high, esteem, for, joyce, and, he, often, used, joyce, s, stream, of, consciousness, technique, regarding, on, the, road, he, wrote, in, a, letter, to, ginsberg, i, can, tell, you, now, as, i, look, back, on, the, flood, of, language, it, is, like, ulysses, and, should, be, treated, with, the, same, gravity, additionally, kerouac, admired, joyce, s, experimental, use, of, language, as, seen, in, his, novel, visions, of, cody, which, uses, an, unconventional, narrative, as, well, as, a, multiplicity, of, authorial, voices, kerouac, and, his, literary, works, had, a, major, impact, on, the, popular, rock, music, of, the, 1960s, artists, including, bob, dylan, the, beatles, patti, smith, tom, waits, the, grateful, dead, and, the, doors, all, credit, kerouac, as, a, significant, influence, on, their, music, and, lifestyles, this, is, especially, so, with, members, of, the, band, the, doors, jim, morrison, and, ray, manzarek, who, quote, jack, kerouac, and, his, novel, on, the, road, as, one, of, the, band, s, greatest, influences, in, his, book, light, my, fire, my, life,

in, relation, to, kerouac, s, work, and, rock, n, roll, in, order, to, vindicate, the, cultural, ideological, and, aesthetic, advancement, in, kerouac, s, work, and, its, relevance, and, the, genesis, of, rock, n, roll, one, must, first, understand, the, origins, of, jazz, and, its, offshoots, the, first, forms, of, jazz, were, formed, in, new, orleans, from, a, melange, of, blues, work, songs, marches, work, songs, african, and, european, music, bop, the, form, of, jazz, that, most, influenced, kerouac, was, created, by, african, american, musicians, in, new, york, basements, between, 1941, and, 1945, bop, arose, as, a, reaction, to, the, perception, of, musical, theft, perpetrated, by, white, entertainers, e, g, benny, goodman, and, his, swing, band, in, an, attempt, to, reclaim, the, cultural, property, of, the, black, community, which, had, informed, every, popular, music, genre, there, has, always, been, an, exchange, of, ideas, and, musical, forms, between, black, and, white, communities, for, example, elvis, sings, gospel, and, blues, and, white, country, songs, and, some, black, rock, n, roll, artists, sing, in, a, manner, similar, to, elvis, or, borrow, elements, from,
