gaius, plinius, secundus, ad, 23, 24, 79, called, pliny, the, elder, p, l, n, i, was, a, roman, author, naturalist, natural, philosopher, naval, and, army, commander, of, the, early, roman, empire, and, a, friend, of, the, emperor, vespasian, he, wrote, the, encyclopedic, naturalis, historia, natural, history, a, comprehensive, thirty, seven, volume, work, covering, a, vast, array, of, topics, on, human, knowledge, and, the, natural, world, which, became, an, editorial, model, for, encyclopedias, he, spent, most, of, his, spare, time, studying, writing, and, investigating, natural, and, geographic, phenomena, in, the, field, among, pliny, s, greatest, works, was, the, twenty, volume, bella, germaniae, the, history, of, the, german, wars, which, is, no, longer, extant, bella, germaniae, which, began, where, aufidius, bassus, libri, belli, germanici, the, war, with, the, germans, left, off, was, used, as, a, source, by, other, prominent, roman, historians, including, plutarch, tacitus, and, suetonius, tacitus, may, have, used, bella, germaniae, as, the, primary, source, for, his, work, de, origine, et, situ, germanorum, on, the, origin, and, situation, of, the, germans, pliny, the, elder, died, in, ad, 79, in, stabiae, while, attempting, the, rescue, of, a, friend, and, her, family, from, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, pliny, s, dates, are, pinned, to, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, in, ad, 79, and, a, statement, by, his, nephew, that, he, died, in, his, 56th, year, which, would, put, his, birth, in, ad, 23, or, 24, pliny, was, the, son, of, an, equestrian, gaius, plinius, celer, and, his, wife, marcella, neither, the, younger, nor, the, elder, pliny, mention, the, names, their, ultimate, source, is, a, fragmentary, inscription, cil, v, 1, 3442, found, in, a, field, in, verona, and, recorded, by, the, 16th, century, augustinian, friar, onofrio, panvinio, the, form, is, an, elegy, the, most, commonly, accepted, reconstruction, is, plinivs, secvndvs, avgv, leri, patri, matri, marcellae, testamento, fieri, ivsso, plinius, secundus, augur, ordered, this, to, be, made, as, a, testament, to, his, father, ler, and, his, mother, marcella, the, actual, words, are, fragmentary, the, reading, of, the, inscription, depends, on, the, reconstruction, but, in, all, cases, the, names, come, through, whether, he, was, an, augur, and, whether, she, was, named, grania, marcella, are, less, certain, jean, hardouin, presents, a, statement, from, an, unknown, source, that, he, claims, was, ancient, that, pliny, was, from, verona, and, that, his, parents, were, celer, and, marcella, hardouin, also, cites, the, conterraneity, see, below, of, catullus, how, the, inscription, got, to, verona, is, unknown, but, it, could, have, arrived, by, dispersal, of, property, from, pliny, the, younger, s, estate, at, colle, plinio, north, of, citt, di, castello, identified, with, certainty, by, his, initials, in, the, roof, tiles, he, kept, statues, of, his, ancestors, there, pliny, the, elder, was, born, at, como, not, at, verona, it, is, only, as, a, native, of, old, gallia, transpadana, that, he, calls, catullus, of, verona, his, conterraneus, or, fellow, countryman, not, his, municeps, or, fellow, townsman, a, statue, of, pliny, on, the, fa, ade, of, the, como, cathedral, celebrates, him, as, a, native, son, he, had, a, sister, plinia, who, married, into, the, caecilii, and, was, the, mother, of, his, nephew, pliny, the, younger, whose, letters, describe, his, work, and, study, regimen, in, detail, in, one, of, his, letters, to, tacitus, avunculus, meus, pliny, the, younger, details, how, his, uncle, s, breakfasts, would, be, light, and, simple, levis, et, facilis, following, the, customs, of, our, forefathers, veterum, more, interdiu, pliny, the, younger, wanted, to, convey, that, pliny, the, elder, was, a, good, roman, which, means, that, he, maintained, the, customs, of, the, great, roman, forefathers, this, statement, would, have, pleased, tacitus, two, inscriptions, identifying, the, hometown, of, pliny, the, younger, as, como, take, precedence, over, the, verona, theory, one, cil, v, 5262, commemorates, the, younger, s, career, as, the, imperial, magistrate, and, details, his, considerable, charitable, and, municipal, expenses, on, behalf, of, the, people, of, como, another, cil, v, 5667, identifies, his, father, lucius, village, as, present, day, fecchio, tribe, oufentina, a, hamlet, of, cant, near, como, therefore, plinia, likely, was, a, local, girl, and, pliny, the, elder, her, brother, was, from, como, gaius, was, a, member, of, the, plinia, gens, the, insubric, root, plina, still, persists, with, rhotacism, in, the, local, surname, prina, he, did, not, take, his, father, s, cognomen, celer, but, assumed, his, own, secundus, as, his, adopted, son, took, the, same, cognomen, pliny, founded, a, branch, the, plinii, secundi, the, family, was, prosperous, pliny, the, younger, s, combined, inherited, estates, made, him, so, wealthy, that, he, could, found, a, school, and, a, library, endow, a, fund, to, feed, the, women, and, children, of, como, and, own, numerous, estates, around, rome, and, lake, como, as, well, as, enrich, some, of, his, friends, as, a, personal, favor, no, earlier, instances, of, the, plinii, are, known, in, 59, bc, only, about, 82, years, before, pliny, s, birth, julius, caesar, founded, novum, comum, reverting, to, comum, as, a, colonia, to, secure, the, region, against, the, alpine, tribes, whom, he, had, been, unable, to, defeat, he, imported, a, population, of, 4, 500, from, other, provinces, to, be, placed, in, comasco, and, 500, aristocratic, greeks, to, found, novum, comum, itself, the, community, was, thus, multi, ethnic, and, the, plinies, could, have, come, from, anywhere, whether, any, conclusions, can, be, drawn, from, pliny, s, preference, for, greek, words, or, julius, pokorny, s, derivation, of, the, name, from, north, italic, as, bald, is, a, matter, of, speculative, opinion, no, record, of, any, ethnic, distinctions, in, pliny, s, time, is, apparent, the, population, considered, themselves, to, be, roman, citizens, pliny, the, elder, did, not, marry, and, had, no, children, in, his, will, he, adopted, his, nephew, which, entitled, the, latter, to, inherit, the, entire, estate, the, adoption, is, called, a, testamental, adoption, by, writers, on, the, topic, who, assert, that, it, applied, to, the, name, change, only, but, roman, jurisprudence, recognizes, no, such, category, pliny, the, younger, thus, became, the, adopted, son, of, pliny, the, elder, after, the, latter, s, death, for, at, least, some, of, the, time, however, pliny, the, elder, resided, in, the, same, house, in, misenum, with, his, sister, and, nephew, whose, husband, and, father, respectively, had, died, young, they, were, living, there, when, pliny, the, elder, decided, to, investigate, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, and, was, sidetracked, by, the, need, for, rescue, operations, and, a, messenger, from, his, friend, asking, for, assistance, pliny, s, father, took, him, to, rome, to, be, educated, in, lawmaking, pliny, relates, that, he, saw, marcus, servilius, nonianus, in, ad, 46, at, about, age, 23, pliny, entered, the, army, as, a, junior, officer, as, was, the, custom, for, young, men, of, equestrian, rank, ronald, syme, plinian, scholar, reconstructs, three, periods, at, three, ranks, pliny, s, interest, in, roman, literature, attracted, the, attention, and, friendship, of, other, men, of, letters, in, the, higher, ranks, with, whom, he, formed, lasting, friendships, later, these, friendships, assisted, his, entry, into, the, upper, echelons, of, the, state, however, he, was, trusted, for, his, knowledge, and, ability, as, well, according, to, syme, he, began, as, a, praefectus, cohortis, a, commander, of, a, cohort, an, infantry, cohort, as, junior, officers, began, in, the, infantry, under, gnaeus, domitius, corbulo, himself, a, writer, whose, works, did, not, survive, in, germania, inferior, in, ad, 47, he, took, part, in, the, roman, conquest, of, the, chauci, and, the, construction, of, the, canal, between, the, rivers, maas, and, rhine, his, description, of, the, roman, ships, anchored, in, the, stream, overnight, having, to, ward, off, floating, trees, has, the, stamp, of, an, eyewitness, account, at, some, uncertain, date, pliny, was, transferred, to, the, command, of, germania, superior, under, publius, pomponius, secundus, with, a, promotion, to, military, tribune, which, was, a, staff, position, with, duties, assigned, by, the, district, commander, pomponius, was, a, half, brother, of, corbulo, they, had, the, same, mother, vistilia, a, powerful, matron, of, the, roman, upper, classes, who, had, seven, children, by, six, husbands, some, of, whom, had, imperial, connections, including, a, future, empress, pliny, s, assignments, are, not, clear, but, he, must, have, participated, in, the, campaign, against, the, chatti, of, ad, 50, at, age, 27, in, his, fourth, year, of, service, associated, with, the, commander, in, the, praetorium, he, became, a, familiar, and, close, friend, of, pomponius, who, also, was, a, man, of, letters, at, another, uncertain, date, pliny, was, transferred, back, to, germania, inferior, corbulo, had, moved, on, assuming, command, in, the, east, this, time, pliny, was, promoted, to, praefectus, alae, commander, of, a, wing, responsible, for, a, cavalry, battalion, of, about, 480, men, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, military, service, there, a, decorative, phalera, or, piece, of, harness, with, his, name, on, it, has, been, found, at, castra, vetera, modern, xanten, then, a, large, roman, army, and, naval, base, on, the, lower, rhine, pliny, s, last, commander, there, apparently, neither, a, man, of, letters, nor, a, close, friend, of, his, was, pompeius, paullinus, governor, of, germania, inferior, ad, 55, 58, pliny, relates, that, he, personally, knew, paulinus, to, have, carried, around, 12, 000, pounds, of, silver, service, on, which, to, dine, in, a, campaign, against, the, germans, a, practice, which, would, not, have, endeared, him, to, the, disciplined, pliny, according, to, his, nephew, during, this, period, he, wrote, his, first, book, perhaps, in, winter, quarters, when, more, spare, time, was, available, a, work, on, the, use, of, missiles, on, horseback, de, jaculatione, equestri, on, the, use, of, the, dart, by, cavalry, it, has, not, survived, but, in, natural, history, he, seems, to, reveal, at, least, part, of, its, content, using, the, movements, of, the, horse, to, assist, the, javelin, man, in, throwing, missiles, while, astride, its, back, during, this, period, he, also, dreamed, that, the, spirit, of, drusus, nero, begged, him, to, save, his, memory, from, oblivion, the, dream, prompted, pliny, to, begin, forthwith, a, history, of, all, the, wars, between, the, romans, and, the, germans, which, he, did, not, complete, for, some, years, at, the, earliest, time, that, pliny, could, have, left, the, service, nero, the, last, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, had, been, emperor, for, two, years, he, did, not, leave, office, until, ad, 68, when, pliny, was, 45, years, old, during, that, time, pliny, did, not, hold, any, high, office, or, work, in, the, service, of, the, state, in, the, subsequent, flavian, dynasty, his, services, were, in, such, demand, that, he, had, to, give, up, his, law, practice, which, suggests, that, he, had, been, trying, not, to, attract, the, attention, of, nero, who, was, a, dangerous, acquaintance, under, nero, pliny, lived, mainly, in, rome, he, mentions, the, map, of, armenia, and, the, neighbourhood, of, the, caspian, sea, which, was, sent, to, rome, by, the, staff, of, corbulo, in, 58, he, also, witnessed, the, construction, of, nero, s, domus, aurea, or, golden, house, after, the, great, fire, of, rome, in, 64, besides, pleading, law, cases, pliny, wrote, researched, and, studied, his, second, published, work, was, the, life, of, pomponius, secundus, a, two, volume, biography, of, his, old, commander, pomponius, secundus, meanwhile, he, was, completing, his, monumental, work, bella, germaniae, the, only, authority, expressly, quoted, in, the, first, six, books, of, the, annales, of, tacitus, and, probably, one, of, the, principal, authorities, for, the, same, author, s, germania, it, disappeared, in, favor, of, the, writings, of, tacitus, which, are, far, shorter, and, early, in, the, fifth, century, symmachus, had, little, hope, of, finding, a, copy, like, caligula, nero, seemed, to, grow, gradually, more, insane, as, his, reign, progressed, pliny, devoted, much, of, his, time, to, writing, on, the, comparatively, safe, subjects, of, grammar, and, rhetoric, he, published, a, three, book, six, volume, educational, manual, on, rhetoric, entitled, studiosus, the, student, pliny, the, younger, says, of, it, the, orator, is, trained, from, his, very, cradle, and, perfected, it, was, followed, by, eight, books, entitled, dubii, sermonis, of, doubtful, phraseology, these, are, both, now, lost, works, his, nephew, relates, he, wrote, this, under, nero, in, the, last, years, of, his, reign, when, every, kind, of, literary, pursuit, which, was, in, the, least, independent, or, elevated, had, been, rendered, dangerous, by, servitude, in, 68, nero, no, longer, had, any, friends, and, supporters, he, committed, suicide, and, the, reign, of, terror, was, at, an, end, as, was, the, interlude, in, pliny, s, obligation, to, the, state, at, the, end, of, ad, 69, after, a, year, of, civil, war, consequent, on, the, death, of, nero, vespasian, a, successful, general, became, emperor, like, pliny, he, had, come, from, the, equestrian, class, rising, through, the, ranks, of, the, army, and, public, offices, and, defeating, the, other, contenders, for, the, highest, office, his, main, tasks, were, to, re, establish, peace, under, imperial, control, and, to, place, the, economy, on, a, sound, footing, he, needed, in, his, administration, all, the, loyalty, and, assistance, he, could, find, pliny, apparently, trusted, without, question, perhaps, reading, between, the, lines, recommended, by, vespasian, s, son, titus, was, put, to, work, immediately, and, was, kept, in, a, continuous, succession, of, the, most, distinguished, procuratorships, according, to, suetonius, a, procurator, was, generally, a, governor, of, an, imperial, province, the, empire, was, perpetually, short, of, and, was, always, seeking, officeholders, for, its, numerous, offices, throughout, the, latter, stages, of, pliny, s, life, he, maintained, good, relations, with, emperor, vespasian, as, is, written, in, the, first, line, of, pliny, the, younger, s, avunculus, meus, ante, lucem, ibat, ad, vespasianum, imperatorem, nam, ille, quoque, noctibus, utebatur, deinde, ad, officium, sibi, delegatum, before, dawn, he, was, going, to, emperor, vespasian, for, he, also, made, use, of, the, night, then, he, did, the, other, duties, assigned, to, him, in, this, passage, pliny, the, younger, conveys, to, tacitus, that, his, uncle, was, ever, the, academic, always, working, the, word, ibat, imperfect, he, used, to, go, gives, a, sense, of, repeated, or, customary, action, in, the, subsequent, text, he, mentions, again, how, most, of, his, uncle, s, day, was, spent, working, reading, and, writing, he, notes, that, pliny, was, indeed, a, very, ready, sleeper, sometimes, dropping, off, in, the, middle, of, his, studies, and, then, waking, up, again, a, definitive, study, of, the, procuratorships, of, pliny, was, compiled, by, the, classical, scholar, friedrich, m, nzer, which, was, reasserted, by, ronald, syme, and, became, a, standard, reference, point, m, nzer, hypothesized, four, procuratorships, of, which, two, are, certainly, attested, and, two, are, probable, but, not, certain, however, two, does, not, satisfy, suetonius, description, of, a, continuous, succession, consequently, plinian, scholars, present, two, to, four, procuratorships, the, four, comprising, i, gallia, narbonensis, in, 70, ii, africa, in, 70, 72, iii, hispania, tarraconensis, in, 72, 74, and, iv, gallia, belgica, in, 74, 76, according, to, syme, pliny, may, have, been, successor, to, valerius, paulinus, procurator, of, gallia, narbonensis, southeastern, france, early, in, ad, 70, he, seems, to, have, a, familiarity, with, the, provincia, which, however, might, otherwise, be, explained, for, example, he, says, in, the, cultivation, of, the, soil, the, manners, and, civilization, of, the, inhabitants, and, the, extent, of, its, wealth, it, is, surpassed, by, none, of, the, provinces, and, in, short, might, be, more, truthfully, described, as, a, part, of, italy, than, as, a, province, denoting, a, general, popular, familiarity, with, the, region, pliny, certainly, spent, some, time, in, the, province, of, africa, most, likely, as, a, procurator, among, other, events, or, features, that, he, saw, are, the, provoking, of, rubetae, poisonous, toads, bufonidae, by, the, psylli, the, buildings, made, with, molded, earthen, walls, superior, in, solidity, to, any, cement, and, the, unusual, fertile, seaside, oasis, of, gab, s, then, tacape, tunisia, currently, a, world, heritage, site, syme, assigns, the, african, procuratorship, to, ad, 70, 72, the, procuratorship, of, hispania, tarraconensis, was, next, a, statement, by, pliny, the, younger, that, his, uncle, was, offered, 400, 000, sesterces, for, his, manuscripts, by, larcius, licinius, while, he, pliny, the, elder, was, procurator, of, hispania, makes, it, the, most, certain, of, the, three, pliny, lists, the, peoples, of, hither, hispania, including, population, statistics, and, civic, rights, modern, asturias, and, gallaecia, he, stops, short, of, mentioning, them, all, for, fear, of, wearying, the, reader, as, this, is, the, only, geographic, region, for, which, he, gives, this, information, syme, hypothesizes, that, pliny, contributed, to, the, census, of, hither, hispania, conducted, in, 73, 74, by, vibius, crispus, legate, from, the, emperor, thus, dating, pliny, s, procuratorship, there, during, his, stay, in, hispania, he, became, familiar, with, the, agriculture, and, especially, the, gold, mines, of, the, north, and, west, of, the, country, his, descriptions, of, the, various, methods, of, mining, appear, to, be, eyewitness, judging, by, the, discussion, of, gold, mining, methods, in, his, natural, history, he, might, have, visited, the, mine, excavated, at, las, m, dulas, the, last, position, of, procurator, an, uncertain, one, was, of, gallia, belgica, based, on, pliny, s, familiarity, with, it, the, capital, of, the, province, was, augusta, treverorum, trier, named, for, the, treveri, surrounding, it, pliny, says, that, in, the, year, but, one, before, this, a, severe, winter, killed, the, first, crops, planted, by, the, treviri, they, sowed, again, in, march, and, had, a, most, abundant, harvest, the, problem, is, to, identify, this, the, year, in, which, the, passage, was, written, using, 77, as, the, date, of, composition, syme, arrives, at, ad, 74, 75, as, the, date, of, the, procuratorship, when, pliny, is, presumed, to, have, witnessed, these, events, the, argument, is, based, entirely, on, presumptions, nevertheless, this, date, is, required, to, achieve, suetonius, continuity, of, procuratorships, if, the, one, in, gallia, belgica, occurred, pliny, was, allowed, home, rome, at, some, time, in, ad, 75, 76, he, was, presumably, at, home, for, the, first, official, release, of, natural, history, in, 77, whether, he, was, in, rome, for, the, dedication, of, vespasian, s, temple, of, peace, in, the, forum, in, 75, which, was, in, essence, a, museum, for, display, of, art, works, plundered, by, nero, and, formerly, adorning, the, domus, aurea, is, uncertain, as, is, his, possible, command, of, the, vigiles, night, watchmen, a, lesser, post, no, actual, post, is, discernible, for, this, period, on, the, bare, circumstances, he, was, an, official, agent, of, the, emperor, in, a, quasiprivate, capacity, perhaps, he, was, between, posts, in, any, case, his, appointment, as, commander, of, the, imperial, fleet, at, misenum, took, him, there, where, he, resided, with, his, sister, and, nephew, vespasian, died, of, disease, on, 23, june, 79, pliny, outlived, him, by, four, months, during, nero, s, reign, of, terror, pliny, avoided, working, on, any, writing, that, would, attract, attention, to, himself, his, works, on, oratory, in, the, last, years, of, nero, s, reign, 67, 68, focused, on, form, rather, than, on, content, he, began, working, on, content, again, probably, after, vespasian, s, rule, began, in, ad, 69, when, the, terror, clearly, was, over, and, would, not, be, resumed, it, was, to, some, degree, reinstituted, and, later, cancelled, by, his, son, titus, when, vespasian, suppressed, the, philosophers, at, rome, but, not, pliny, who, was, not, among, them, representing, as, he, says, something, new, in, rome, an, encyclopedist, certainly, a, venerable, tradition, outside, italy, in, his, next, work, bella, germaniae, pliny, completed, the, history, which, aufidius, bassus, left, unfinished, pliny, s, continuation, of, bassus, s, history, was, one, of, the, authorities, followed, by, suetonius, and, plutarch, tacitus, also, cites, pliny, as, a, source, he, is, mentioned, concerning, the, loyalty, of, burrus, commander, of, the, praetorian, guard, whom, nero, removed, for, disloyalty, tacitus, portrays, parts, of, pliny, s, view, of, the, pisonian, conspiracy, to, kill, nero, and, make, piso, emperor, as, absurd, and, mentions, that, he, could, not, decide, whether, pliny, s, account, or, that, of, messalla, was, more, accurate, concerning, some, of, the, details, of, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, evidently, pliny, s, extension, of, bassus, extended, at, least, from, the, reign, of, nero, to, that, of, vespasian, pliny, seems, to, have, known, it, was, going, to, be, controversial, as, he, deliberately, reserved, it, for, publication, after, his, death, it, has, been, long, completed, and, its, accuracy, confirmed, but, i, have, determined, to, commit, the, charge, of, it, to, my, heirs, lest, i, should, have, been, suspected, during, my, lifetime, of, having, been, unduly, influenced, by, ambition, by, this, means, i, confer, an, obligation, on, those, who, occupy, the, same, ground, with, myself, and, also, on, posterity, who, i, am, aware, will, contend, with, me, as, i, have, done, with, my, predecessors, pliny, s, last, work, according, to, his, nephew, was, the, naturalis, historia, natural, history, an, encyclopedia, into, which, he, collected, much, of, the, knowledge, of, his, time, some, historians, consider, this, to, be, the, first, encyclopedia, written, it, comprised, 37, books, his, sources, were, personal, experience, his, own, prior, works, such, as, the, work, on, germania, and, extracts, from, other, works, these, extracts, were, collected, in, the, following, manner, one, servant, would, read, aloud, and, another, would, write, the, extract, as, dictated, by, pliny, he, is, said, to, have, dictated, extracts, while, taking, a, bath, in, winter, he, furnished, the, copier, with, gloves, and, long, sleeves, so, his, writing, hand, would, not, stiffen, with, cold, pliny, the, younger, in, avunculus, meus, his, extract, collection, finally, reached, about, 160, volumes, which, larcius, licinius, the, praetorian, legate, of, hispania, tarraconensis, unsuccessfully, offered, to, purchase, for, 400, 000, sesterces, that, would, have, been, in, 73, 74, see, above, pliny, bequeathed, the, extracts, to, his, nephew, when, composition, of, natural, history, began, is, unknown, since, he, was, preoccupied, with, his, other, works, under, nero, and, then, had, to, finish, the, history, of, his, times, he, is, unlikely, to, have, begun, before, 70, the, procuratorships, offered, the, ideal, opportunity, for, an, encyclopedic, frame, of, mind, the, date, of, an, overall, composition, cannot, be, assigned, to, any, one, year, the, dates, of, different, parts, must, be, determined, if, they, can, by, philological, analysis, the, post, mortem, of, the, scholars, the, closest, known, event, to, a, single, publication, date, that, is, when, the, manuscript, was, probably, released, to, the, public, for, borrowing, and, copying, and, was, probably, sent, to, the, flavians, is, the, date, of, the, dedication, in, the, first, of, the, 37, books, it, is, to, the, imperator, titus, as, titus, and, vespasian, had, the, same, name, titus, flavius, vespasianus, earlier, writers, hypothesized, a, dedication, to, vespasian, pliny, s, mention, of, a, brother, domitian, and, joint, offices, with, a, father, calling, that, father, great, points, certainly, to, titus, pliny, also, says, that, titus, had, been, consul, six, times, the, first, six, consulships, of, titus, were, in, 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, and, 77, all, conjointly, with, vespasian, and, the, seventh, was, in, 79, this, brings, the, date, of, the, dedication, probably, to, 77, in, that, year, vespasian, was, 68, he, had, been, ruling, conjointly, with, titus, for, some, years, the, title, imperator, does, not, indicate, that, titus, was, sole, emperor, but, was, awarded, for, a, military, victory, in, this, case, that, in, jerusalem, in, 70, aside, from, minor, finishing, touches, the, work, in, 37, books, was, completed, in, ad, 77, that, it, was, written, entirely, in, 77, or, that, pliny, was, finished, with, it, then, cannot, be, proved, moreover, the, dedication, could, have, been, written, before, publication, and, it, could, have, been, published, either, privately, or, publicly, earlier, without, the, dedication, the, only, certain, fact, is, that, pliny, died, in, ad, 79, natural, history, is, one, of, the, largest, single, works, to, have, survived, from, the, roman, empire, and, was, intended, to, cover, the, entire, field, of, ancient, knowledge, based, on, the, best, authorities, available, to, pliny, he, claims, to, be, the, only, roman, ever, to, have, undertaken, such, a, work, it, encompasses, the, fields, of, botany, zoology, astronomy, geology, and, mineralogy, as, well, as, the, exploitation, of, those, resources, it, remains, a, standard, work, for, the, roman, period, and, the, advances, in, technology, and, understanding, of, natural, phenomena, at, the, time, his, discussions, of, some, technical, advances, are, the, only, sources, for, those, inventions, such, as, hushing, in, mining, technology, or, the, use, of, water, mills, for, crushing, or, grinding, grain, much, of, what, he, wrote, about, has, been, confirmed, by, archaeology, it, is, virtually, the, only, work, that, describes, the, work, of, artists, of, the, time, and, is, a, reference, work, for, the, history, of, art, as, such, pliny, s, approach, to, describing, the, work, of, artists, informed, lorenzo, ghiberti, in, writing, his, commentaries, in, the, 15th, century, and, giorgio, vasari, who, wrote, the, celebrated, lives, of, the, most, excellent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, in, 1550, some, historians, consider, natural, history, to, be, the, first, encyclopedia, ever, written, it, was, the, earliest, encyclopedia, to, survive, there, were, many, ancient, histories, written, before, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, but, scholars, still, recognize, natural, history, as, an, encyclopedia, setting, it, apart, from, the, other, ancient, histories, regardless, of, if, it, was, first, it, is, certainly, the, most, significant, through, natural, history, pliny, the, elder, gives, modern, experts, a, view, into, meanings, of, various, things, from, first, century, rome, in, a, way, that, no, other, surviving, text, does, each, book, of, the, natural, history, covers, a, different, topic, and, the, work, is, meant, to, cover, every, topic, given, the, organization, of, the, work, it, is, clear, that, it, was, meant, to, be, a, reference, resource, even, modern, scholars, will, sometimes, compare, an, unknown, object, mentioned, in, a, different, ancient, text, with, the, objects, described, by, pliny, and, make, comparisons, modern, scholars, are, also, able, to, use, natural, history, to, understand, the, traditions, fantasies, and, prejudices, in, ancient, rome, some, people, have, said, that, certain, prejudices, that, have, been, prevalent, throughout, western, history, such, as, a, stigma, around, menstruation, were, spread, by, natural, history, the, work, became, a, model, for, all, later, encyclopedias, in, terms, of, the, breadth, of, subject, matter, examined, the, need, to, reference, original, authors, and, a, comprehensive, index, list, of, the, contents, it, is, the, only, work, by, pliny, to, have, survived, and, the, last, that, he, published, lacking, a, final, revision, at, his, sudden, and, unexpected, death, in, the, ad, 79, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, pliny, who, had, been, appointed, praefectus, classis, in, the, roman, navy, by, vespasian, was, stationed, with, the, fleet, at, misenum, at, the, time, of, the, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, he, organized, and, led, a, rescue, mission, upon, receiving, a, message, from, his, friend, rectina, who, had, been, left, stranded, in, stabiae, during, the, eruption, pliny, boarded, one, of, several, galleys, that, he, dispatched, across, the, gulf, of, naples, to, stabiae, as, pliny, s, vessel, approached, the, shore, near, herculaneum, cinders, and, pumice, began, to, fall, on, it, the, helmsman, advised, turning, back, to, which, pliny, replied, fortune, favours, the, bold, steer, to, where, pomponianus, is, upon, reaching, stabiae, they, found, senator, pomponianus, but, the, same, winds, that, brought, them, there, prevented, them, from, leaving, the, group, waited, for, the, wind, to, abate, but, they, decided, to, leave, later, that, evening, for, fear, that, their, houses, would, collapse, the, group, fled, when, a, plume, of, hot, toxic, gases, engulfed, them, pliny, a, corpulent, man, who, suffered, from, a, chronic, respiratory, condition, possibly, asthma, died, from, asphyxiation, caused, by, the, toxic, gases, and, was, left, behind, upon, the, group, s, return, three, days, later, after, the, plume, had, dispersed, pliny, s, body, was, found, with, no, apparent, external, injuries, twenty, seven, years, later, upon, a, request, from, tacitus, pliny, the, younger, provided, an, account, obtained, from, the, survivors, from, stabiae, of, his, uncle, s, death, suetonius, wrote, that, pliny, approached, the, shore, only, from, scientific, interest, and, then, asked, a, slave, to, kill, him, to, avoid, heat, from, the, volcano, in, 1859, jacob, bigelow, after, summarizing, the, information, about, pliny, s, death, contained, in, pliny, the, younger, s, letter, to, tacitus, concluded, that, pliny, had, died, from, apoplexy, stroke, or, heart, disease
