effort, a, review, of, her, correspondence, reveals, a, complete, contradiction, between, the, clumsiness, of, chanel, the, letter, writer, and, the, talent, of, chanel, as, a, composer, of, maxims, after, correcting, the, handful, of, aphorisms, that, chanel, wrote, about, her, m, tier, reverdy, added, to, this, collection, of, chanelisms, a, series, of, thoughts, of, a, more, general, nature, some, touching, on, life, and, taste, others, on, allure, and, love, 328, her, involvement, with, iribe, was, a, deep, one, until, his, sudden, death, in, 1935, iribe, and, chanel, shared, the, same,

palasse, labrunie, when, chanel, returned, home, she, said, churchill, had, me, freed, 186, 87, the, extent, of, churchill, s, intervention, for, chanel, after, the, war, became, a, subject, of, gossip, and, speculation, some, historians, claimed, that, people, worried, that, if, chanel, were, forced, to, testify, about, her, own, activities, at, trial, she, would, expose, the, pro, nazi, sympathies, and, activities, of, certain, top, level, british, officials, members, of, the, society, elite, and, the, royal, family, vaughan, writes, that, some, claim, that, churchill, instructed,

friend, and, biographer, marcel, haedrich, said, of, her, wartime, interaction, with, the, nazi, regime, if, one, took, seriously, the, few, disclosures, that, mademoiselle, chanel, allowed, herself, to, make, about, those, black, years, of, the, occupation, one, s, teeth, would, be, set, on, edge, but, the, truth, was, that, the, war, simply, did, not, interest, her, her, overpowering, egocentricity, protected, her, better, than, the, maginot, line, had, protected, her, country, no, one, could, impinge, upon, what, one, might, call, her, splendid, isolation, she, said, there, will, always, be, wars, because, so, many, medicines, are, being, invented, that, soon, people, won, t, die, anymore, churchill, and, chanel, s, friendship, marks, its, origin, in, the, 1920s, with, the, eruption, of, chanel, s, scandalous, beginning, when, falling, in, love, with, the, duke, of, westminster, churchill, s, intervention, at, the, end, of, the, war, prevented, chanel, s, punishment, for, spy, collaborations, and, ultimately, salvaged, her, legacy, in, 2023, a, purported, membership, card, for, the, french, resistance, belonging, to, chanel, was, discovered, in, the, french,

portions, of, which, were, published, by, several, media, outlets, chanel, corporate, refuted, the, claim, of, espionage, while, acknowledging, that, company, officials, had, read, only, media, excerpts, of, the, book, the, chanel, group, stated, what, is, certain, is, that, she, had, a, relationship, with, a, german, aristocrat, during, the, war, clearly, it, wasn, t, the, best, period, to, have, a, love, story, with, a, german, even, if, baron, von, dincklage, was, english, by, his, mother, and, she, chanel, knew, him, before, the, war, in, an, interview, given, to, the, associated, press, author, vaughan, discussed, the, unexpected, turn, of, his, research, i, was, looking, for, something, else, and, i, come, across, this, document, saying, chanel, is, a, nazi, agent, then, i, really, started, hunting, through, all, of, the, archives, in, the, united, states, in, london, in, berlin, and, in, rome, and, i, came, across, not, one, but, 20, 30, 40, absolutely, solid, archival, materials, on, chanel, and, her, lover, hans, g, nther, von, dincklage, who, was, a, professional, abwehr, spy, vaughan, also, addressed, the, discomfort, many, felt, with, the, revelations, provided, in, his, book, a, lot, of, people, in, this, world, don, t, want, the, iconic, figure, of, gabrielle, coco, chanel, one, of, france, s, great, cultural, idols, destroyed, this, is, definitely, something, that, a, lot, of, people, would, have, preferred, to, put, aside, to, forget, to, just, go, on, selling, chanel, scarves, and, jewellery, in, 1945, chanel, moved, to, switzerland, where, she, lived, for, several, years, part, of, the, time, with, dincklage, in, 1953, she, sold, her, villa, la, pausa, on, the, french, riviera, to, the, publisher, and, translator, emery, reves, five,

battle, pierre, wertheimer, 176, 77, when, chanel, came, out, with, her, comeback, collection, in, 1954, the, french, press, were, cautious, due, to, her, collaboration, during, the, war, and, the, controversy, of, the, collection, however, the, american, and, british, press, saw, it, as, a, breakthrough, bringing, together, fashion, and, youth, in, a, new, way, bettina, ballard, the, influential, editor, of, the, us, vogue, remained, loyal, to, chanel, and, featured, the, model, marie, h, l, ne, arnaud, the, face, of, chanel, in, the, 1950s, in, the, march, 1954, issue, 270,

by, her, nephew, andr, palasse, who, lived, in, switzerland, and, his, two, daughters, who, lived, in, paris, although, chanel, was, viewed, as, a, prominent, figure, of, luxury, fashion, during, her, life, chanel, s, influence, has, been, examined, further, after, her, death, in, 1971, when, chanel, died, the, first, lady, of, france, mme, pompidou, organised, a, hero, s, tribute, soon, french,

influence, gone, were, the, aigrettes, long, hair, hobble, skirts, 11, her, design, aesthetic, redefined, the, fashionable, woman, in, the, post, world, war, i, era, the, chanel, trademark, look, was, of, youthful, ease, liberated, physicality, and, unencumbered, sportive, confidence, the, horse, culture, and, penchant, for, hunting, so, passionately, pursued, by, the, elites, especially, the, british, fired, chanel, s, imagination, her, own, enthusiastic, indulgence, in, the, sporting, life, led, to, clothing, designs, informed, by, those, activities, from, her, excursions, on, water, with, the, yachting, world, she, appropriated, the, clothing, associated, with, nautical, pursuits, the, horizontal, striped, shirt, bell, bottom, pants, crewneck, sweaters, and, espadrille, shoes, all, traditionally, worn, by, sailors, and, fishermen, 47, 79, chanel, s, initial, triumph, was, her, innovative, use, of, jersey, a, machine, knit, material, manufactured, for, her, by, the, firm, rodier, 128, 133, traditionally, relegated, to, the, manufacture, of, undergarments, and, sportswear, tennis, golf, and, beach, attire, jersey, was, considered, too, ordinary, to, be, used, in, couture, and, was, disliked, by, designers, because, the, knit, structure, made, it, difficult, to, handle, compared, to, woven, fabrics, according, to, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, with, her, financial, situation, precarious, in, the, early, years, of, her, design, career, chanel, purchased, jersey, primarily, for, its, low, cost, the, qualities, of, the, fabric, however, ensured, that, the, designer, would, continue, to, use, it, long, after, her, business, became, profitable, chanel, s, early, wool, jersey, travelling, suit, consisted, of, a, cardigan, jacket, and, pleated, skirt, paired, with, a, low, belted, pullover, top, this, ensemble, worn, with, low, heeled, shoes, became, the, casual, look, in, expensive, women, s, wear, 13, 47, chanel, s, introduction, of, jersey, to, high, fashion, worked, well, for, two, reasons, first, the, war, had, caused, a, shortage, of, more, traditional, couture, materials, and, second, women, began, desiring, simpler, and, more, practical, clothes, her, fluid, jersey, suits, and, dresses, were, created, with, these, notions, in, mind, and, allowed, for, free, and, easy, movement, this, was, greatly, appreciated, at, the, time, because, women, were, working, for, the, war, effort, as, nurses, civil, servants, and, in, factories, their, jobs, involved, physical, activity, and, they, had, to, ride, trains, buses, and, bicycles, to, get, to, work, 57, for, such, circumstances, they, desired, outfits, that, did, not, give, way, easily, and, could, be, put, on, without, the, help, of, servants, 28, designers, such, as, paul, poiret, and, fortuny, introduced, ethnic, references, into, haute, couture, in, the, 1900s, and, early, 1910s, chanel, continued, this, trend, with, slav, inspired, designs, in, the, early, 1920s, the, beading, and, embroidery, on, her, garments, at, this, time, was, exclusively, executed, by, kitmir, an, embroidery, house, founded, by, an, exiled, russian, aristocrat, the, grand,
