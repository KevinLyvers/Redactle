precursor, to, modernism, especially, in, his, attempts, to, paint, nature, as, he, perceived, it, during, his, long, career, he, was, the, most, consistent, and, prolific, practitioner, of, impressionism, s, philosophy, of, expressing, one, s, perceptions, of, nature, especially, as, applied, to, plein, air, outdoor, landscape, painting, the, term, impressionism, is, derived, from, the, title, of, his, painting, impression, soleil, levant, which, was, first, exhibited, in, the, so, called, exhibition, of, rejects, of, 1874, an, exhibition, initiated, by, monet, and, like, minded, artists, as, an, alternative, to, the, salon, monet, was, raised, in, le, havre, normandy, and, became, interested, in, the, outdoors, and, drawing, from, an, early, age, although, his, mother,

landscapes, seascapes, and, portraits, but, attracted, little, attention, a, key, early, influence, was, eug, ne, boudin, who, introduced, him, to, the, concept, of, plein, air, painting, from, 1883, monet, lived, in, giverny, also, in, northern, france, where, he, purchased, a, house, and, property, and, began, a, vast, landscaping, project, including, a, water, lily, pond, monet, s, ambition, to, document, the, french, countryside, led, to, a, method, of, painting, the, same, scene, many, times, so, as, to, capture, the, changing, of, light, and, the, passing, of, the, seasons, among, the, best, known, examples, are, his, series, of, haystacks, 1890, 1891, paintings, of, rouen, cathedral, 1892, 1894, and, the, paintings, of, water, lilies, in, his, garden, in, giverny, that, occupied, him, continuously, for, the, last, 20, years, of, his, life, frequently, exhibited, and, successful, during, his, lifetime, monet, s, fame, and, popularity, soared, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, when, he, became, one, of, the, world, s, most, famous, painters, and, a, source, of, inspiration, for, a, burgeoning, group, of, artists, claude, monet, was, born, on, 14, november, 1840, on, the, fifth, floor, of, 45, rue, laffitte, in, the, 9th, arrondissement, of, paris, he, was, the, second, son, of, claude, adolphe, monet, 1800, 1871, and, louise, justine, aubr, e, monet,

to, go, into, the, family, s, ship, chandling, and, grocery, business, but, monet, wanted, to, become, an, artist, his, mother, was, a, singer, and, supported, monet, s, desire, for, a, career, in, art, on, 1, april, 1851, he, entered, le, havre, secondary, school, of, the, arts, he, was, an, apathetic, student, who, after, showing, skill, in, art, from, young, age, began, drawing, caricatures, and, portraits, of, acquaintances, at, age, 15, for, money, he, began, his, first, drawing, lessons, from, jacques, fran, ois, ochard, a, former, student, of, jacques, louis, david, in, around, 1858, he, met, fellow, artist, eug, ne, boudin, who, would, encourage, monet, to, develop, his, techniques, teach, him, the, en, plein, air, outdoor, techniques, for, painting, and, take, monet, on, painting, excursions, monet, thought, of, boudin, as, his, master, whom, he, owed, everything, to, for, his, later, success, in, 1857, his, mother, died, he, lived, with, his, father, and, aunt, marie, jeanne, lecadre, lecadre, would, be, a, source, of, support, for, monet, in, his, early, art, career, from, 1858, to, 1860, monet, continued, his, studies, in, paris, where, he, enrolled, in, acad, mie, suisse, and, met, camille, pissarro, in, 1859, he, was, called, for, military, service, and, served, under, the, chasseurs, d, afrique, african, hunters, in, algeria, from, 1861, to, 1862, his, time, in, algeria, had, a, powerful, effect, on, monet, who, later, said, that, the, light, and, vivid, colours, of, north, africa, contained, the, gem, of, my, future, researches, illness, forced, his, return, to, le, havre, where, he, bought, out, his, remaining, service, and, met, johan, barthold, jongkind, who, together, with, boudin, was, an, important, mentor, to, monet, upon, his, return, to, paris, with, the, permission, of, his, father, he, divided, his, time, between, his, childhood, home, and, the, countryside, and, enrolled, in, charles, gleyre, s, studio, where, he, met, pierre, auguste, renoir, and, fr, d, ric, bazille, bazille, eventually, became, his, closest, friend, in, search, of, motifs, they, traveled, to, honfleur, where, monet, painted, several, studies, of, the, harbor, and, the, mouth, of, the, seine, monet, often, painted, alongside, renoir, and, alfred, sisley, both, of, whom, shared, his, desire, to, articulate, new, standards, of, beauty, in, conventional, subjects, during, this, time, he, painted, women, in, garden, his, first, successful, large, scale, painting, and, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, the, most, important, painting, of, monet, s, early, period, having, debuted, at, the, salon, in, 1865, with, la, pointe, de, la, h, ve, at, low, tide, and, mouth, of, the, seine, at, honfleur, to, large, praise, he, hoped, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, would, help, him, break, through, into, the, salon, of, 1866, he, could, not, finish, it, in, a, timely, manner, and, instead, submitted, the, woman, in, the, green, dress, and, pav, de, chailly, to, acceptance, thereafter, he, submitted, works, to, the, salon, annually, until, 1870, but, they, were, accepted, by, the, juries, only, twice, in, 1866, and, 1868, he, sent, no, more, works, to, the, salon, until, his, single, final, attempt, in, 1880, his, work, was, considered, radical, discouraged, at, all, official, levels, in, 1867, his, then, mistress, camille, doncieux, whom, he, had, met, two, years, earlier, as, a, model, for, his, paintings, gave, birth, to, their, first, child, jean, monet, had, a, strong, relationship, with, jean, claiming, that, camille, was, his, lawful, wife, so, jean, would, be, considered, legitimate, monet, s, father, stopped, financially, supporting, him, as, a, result, of, the, relationship, earlier, in, the, year, monet, had, been, forced, to, move, to, his, aunt, s, house, in, sainte, adresse, there, he, immersed, himself, in, his, work, although, a, temporary, problem, with, his, eyesight, probably, related, to, stress, prevented, him, from, working, in, sunlight, monet, loved, his, family, dearly, painting, many, portraits, of, them, such, as, child, with, a, cup, a, portrait, of, jean, monet, this, painting, in, particular, shows, the, first, signs, of, monets, later, famous, impressionistic, work, with, help, from, the, art, collector, louis, joachim, gaudibert, he, reunited, with, camille, and, moved, to, tretat, the, following, year, around, this, time, he, was, trying, to, establish, himself, as, a, figure, painter, who, depicted, the, explicitly, contemporary, bourgeois, an, intention, that, continued, into, the, 1870s, he, did, evolve, his, painting, technique, and, integrate, stylistic, experimentation, in, his, plein, air, style, as, evidenced, by, the, beach, at, sainte, adresse, and, on, the, bank, of, the, seine, respectively, the, former, being, his, first, sustained, campaign, of, painting, that, involved, tourism, several, of, his, paintings, had, been, purchased, by, gaudibert, who, commissioned, a, painting, of, his, wife, alongside, other, projects, the, gaudiberts, were, for, two, years, the, most, supportive, of, monet, s, hometown, patrons, monet, would, later, be, financially, supported, by, the, artist, and, art, collector, gustave, caillebotte, bazille, and, perhaps, gustave, courbet, although, creditors, still, pursued, him, he, married, camille, on, 28, june, 1870, just, before, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, during, the, war, he, and, his, family, lived, in, london, and, the, netherlands, to, avoid, conscription, monet, and, charles, fran, ois, daubigny, lived, in, self, imposed, exile, while, living, in, london, monet, met, his, old, friend, pissarro, and, the, american, painter, james, abbott, mcneill, whistler, and, befriended, his, first, and, primary, art, dealer, paul, durand, ruel, an, encounter, that, would, be, decisive, for, his, career, there, he, saw, and, admired, the, works, of, john, constable, and, j, m, w, turner, and, was, impressed, by, turner, s, treatment, of, light, especially, in, the, works, depicting, the, fog, on, the, thames, he, repeatedly, painted, the, thames, hyde, park, and, green, park, in, the, spring, of, 1871, his, works, were, refused, authorisation, for, inclusion, in, the, royal, academy, exhibition, and, police, suspected, him, of, revolutionary, activities, that, same, year, he, learned, of, his, father, s, death, the, family, moved, to, argenteuil, in, 1871, where, he, influenced, by, his, time, with, dutch, painters, mostly, painted, the, seine, s, surrounding, area, he, acquired, a, sailboat, to, paint, on, the, river, in, 1874, he, signed, a, six, and, a, half, year, lease, and, moved, into, a, newly, built, rose, colored, house, with, green, shutters, in, argenteuil, where, he, painted, fifteen, paintings, of, his, garden, from, a, panoramic, perspective, paintings, such, as, gladioli, marked, what, was, likely, the, first, time, monet, had, cultivated, a, garden, for, the, purpose, of, his, art, the, house, and, garden, became, the, single, most, important, motif, of, his, final, years, in, argenteuil, for, the, next, four, years, he, painted, mostly, in, argenteuil, and, took, an, interest, in, the, colour, theories, of, chemist, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, for, three, years, of, the, decade, he, rented, a, large, villa, in, saint, denis, for, a, thousand, francs, per, year, camille, monet, on, a, garden, bench, displays, the, garden, of, the, villa, and, what, some, have, argued, to, be, camille, s, grief, upon, learning, of, her, father, s, death, monet, and, camille, were, often, in, financial, straits, during, this, period, they, were, unable, to, pay, their, hotel, bill, during, the, summer, of, 1870, and, likely, lived, on, the, outskirts, of, london, as, a, result, of, insufficient, funds, an, inheritance, from, his, father, together, with, sales, of, his, paintings, did, however, enable, them, to, hire, two, servants, and, a, gardener, by, 1872, following, the, successful, exhibition, of, some, maritime, paintings, and, the, winning, of, a, silver, medal, at, le, havre, monet, s, paintings, were, seized, by, creditors, from, whom, they, were, bought, back, by, a, shipping, merchant, gaudibert, who, was, also, a, patron, of, boudin, when, durand, ruel, s, previous, support, of, monet, and, his, peers, began, to, decline, monet, renoir, pissarro, sisley, paul, c, zanne, edgar, degas, and, berthe, morisot, exhibited, their, work, independently, they, did, so, under, the, name, the, anonymous, society, of, painters, sculptors, and, engravers, for, which, monet, was, a, leading, figure, in, its, formation, he, was, inspired, by, the, style, and, subject, matter, of, his, slightly, older, contemporaries, pissarro, and, douard, manet, the, group, whose, title, was, chosen, to, avoid, association, with, any, style, or, movement, were, unified, in, their, independence, from, the, salon, and, rejection, of, the, prevailing, academicism, monet, gained, a, reputation, as, the, foremost, landscape, painter, of, the, group, at, the, first, exhibition, in, 1874, monet, displayed, among, others, impression, sunrise, the, luncheon, and, boulevard, des, capucines, the, art, critic, louis, leroy, wrote, a, hostile, review, taking, particular, notice, of, impression, sunrise, 1872, a, hazy, depiction, of, le, havre, port, and, stylistic, detour, he, coined, the, term, impressionism, conservative, critics, and, the, public, derided, the, group, with, the, term, initially, being, ironic, and, denoting, the, painting, as, unfinished, more, progressive, critics, praised, the, depiction, of, modern, life, louis, edmond, duranty, called, their, style, a, revolution, in, painting, leroy, later, regretted, inspiring, the, name, as, he, believed, that, they, were, a, group, whose, majority, had, nothing, impressionist, the, total, attendance, is, estimated, at, 3500, monet, priced, impression, sunrise, at, 1000, francs, but, failed, to, sell, it, the, exhibition, was, open, to, anyone, prepared, to, pay, 60, francs, and, gave, artists, the, opportunity, to, show, their, work, without, the, interference, of, a, jury, another, exhibition, was, held, in, 1876, again, in, opposition, to, the, salon, monet, displayed, 18, paintings, including, the, beach, at, sainte, adresse, which, showcased, multiple, impressionist, characteristics, for, the, third, exhibition, on, 5, april, 1877, he, selected, seven, paintings, from, the, dozen, he, had, made, of, gare, saint, lazare, in, the, past, three, months, the, first, time, he, had, synced, as, many, paintings, of, the, same, site, carefully, coordinating, their, scenes, and, temporalities, the, paintings, were, well, received, by, critics, who, especially, praised, the, way, he, captured, the, arrival, and, departures, of, the, trains, by, the, fourth, exhibition, his, involvement, was, by, means, of, negotiation, on, caillebotte, s, part, his, last, time, exhibiting, with, the, impressionists, was, in, 1882, four, years, before, the, final, impressionist, exhibition, monet, renoir, pissarro, morisot, c, zanne, and, sisley, proceeded, to, experiment, with, new, methods, of, depicting, reality, they, rejected, the, dark, contrasting, lighting, of, romantic, and, realist, paintings, in, favour, of, the, pale, tones, of, their, peers, paintings, such, as, those, by, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, and, boudin, after, developing, methods, for, painting, transient, effects, monet, would, go, on, to, seek, more, demanding, subjects, new, patrons, and, collectors, his, paintings, produced, in, the, early, 1870s, left, a, lasting, impact, on, the, movement, and, his, peers, many, of, whom, moved, to, argenteuil, as, a, result, of, admiring, his, depiction, in, 1875, he, returned, to, figure, painting, with, woman, with, a, parasol, madame, monet, and, her, son, after, effectively, abandoning, it, with, the, luncheon, his, interest, in, the, figure, continued, for, the, next, four, years, reaching, its, crest, in, 1877, and, concluding, altogether, in, 1890, in, an, unusually, revealing, letter, to, th, odore, duret, monet, discussed, his, revitalised, interest, i, am, working, like, never, before, on, a, new, endeavour, figures, in, plein, air, as, i, understand, them, this, is, an, old, dream, one, that, has, always, obsessed, me, and, that, i, would, like, to, master, once, and, for, all, but, it, is, all, so, difficult, i, am, working, very, hard, almost, to, the, point, of, making, myself, ill, in, 1876, camille, monet, became, seriously, ill, their, second, son, michel, was, born, in, 1878, after, which, camille, s, health, deteriorated, further, in, the, autumn, of, that, year, they, moved, to, the, village, of, v, theuil, where, they, shared, a, house, with, the, family, of, ernest, hosched, a, wealthy, department, store, owner, and, patron, of, the, arts, who, had, commissioned, four, paintings, from, monet, in, 1878, camille, was, diagnosed, with, uterine, cancer, she, died, the, next, year, her, death, alongside, financial, difficulties, once, having, to, leave, his, house, to, avoid, creditors, afflicted, monet, s, career, hosched, had, recently, purchased, several, paintings, but, soon, went, bankrupt, leaving, for, paris, in, hopes, of, regaining, his, fortune, as, interest, in, the, impressionists, dwindled, monet, made, a, study, in, oils, of, his, late, wife, many, years, later, he, confessed, to, his, friend, georges, clemenceau, that, his, need, to, analyse, colours, was, both, a, joy, and, a, torment, to, him, he, explained, i, one, day, found, myself, looking, at, my, beloved, wife, s, dead, face, and, just, systematically, noting, the, colours, according, to, an, automatic, reflex, john, berger, describes, the, work, as, a, blizzard, of, white, grey, purplish, paint, a, terrible, blizzard, of, loss, which, will, forever, efface, her, features, in, fact, there, can, be, very, few, death, bed, paintings, which, have, been, so, intensely, felt, or, subjectively, expressive, monet, s, study, of, the, seine, continued, he, submitted, two, paintings, to, the, salon, in, 1880, one, of, which, was, accepted, he, began, to, abandon, impressionist, techniques, as, his, paintings, utilised, darker, tones, and, displayed, environments, such, as, the, seine, river, in, harsh, weather, for, the, rest, of, the, decade, he, focused, on, the, elemental, aspect, of, nature, his, personal, life, influenced, his, distancing, from, the, impressionists, he, returned, to, tretat, and, expressed, in, letters, to, alice, hosched, who, he, would, marry, in, 1892, following, her, husband, s, death, the, preceding, year, a, desire, to, die, in, 1881, he, moved, with, alice, and, her, children, to, poissy, and, again, sold, his, paintings, to, durand, ruel, alice, s, third, daughter, suzanne, would, become, monet, s, preferred, model, after, camille, in, april, 1883, looking, out, the, window, of, the, train, between, vernon, and, gasny, he, discovered, giverny, in, normandy, that, same, year, his, first, major, retrospective, show, was, held, in, a, letter, sent, to, monet, in, 1884, paul, durand, ruel, mentions, monet, s, financial, worries, and, tells, him, that, both, the, stockbroker, theodore, charles, gadala, and, georges, clemenceau, have, purchased, paintings, monet, s, struggles, with, creditors, ended, following, prosperous, trips, he, went, to, bordighera, in, 1884, and, brought, back, 50, landscapes, he, travelled, to, the, netherlands, in, 1886, to, paint, the, tulips, he, soon, met, and, became, friends, with, gustave, geffroy, who, published, an, article, on, monet, despite, his, qualms, monet, s, paintings, were, sold, in, america, and, contributed, towards, his, financial, security, in, contrast, to, the, last, two, decades, of, his, career, monet, favoured, working, alone, and, felt, that, he, was, always, better, when, he, did, having, regularly, long, for, solitude, away, from, crowded, tourist, resorts, and, sophisticated, urban, settings, such, a, desire, was, recurrent, in, his, letters, to, alice, in, 1883, monet, and, his, family, rented, a, house, and, gardens, in, giverny, which, provided, him, domestic, stability, he, had, not, yet, enjoyed, the, house, was, situated, near, the, main, road, between, the, towns, of, vernon, and, gasny, at, giverny, there, was, a, barn, that, doubled, as, a, painting, studio, orchards, and, a, small, garden, the, house, was, close, enough, to, the, local, schools, for, the, children, to, attend, and, the, surrounding, landscape, provided, numerous, natural, areas, for, monet, to, paint, the, family, worked, and, built, up, the, gardens, and, monet, s, fortunes, began, to, change, for, the, better, as, durand, ruel, had, increasing, success, in, selling, his, paintings, the, gardens, were, monet, s, greatest, source, of, inspiration, for, 40, years, in, 1890, monet, purchased, the, house, during, the, 1890s, monet, built, a, greenhouse, and, a, second, studio, a, spacious, building, well, lit, with, skylights, monet, wrote, daily, instructions, to, his, gardener, precise, designs, and, layouts, for, plantings, and, invoices, for, his, floral, purchases, and, his, collection, of, botany, books, as, monet, s, wealth, grew, his, garden, evolved, he, remained, its, architect, even, after, he, hired, seven, gardeners, monet, purchased, additional, land, with, a, water, meadow, white, water, lilies, local, to, france, were, planted, along, with, imported, cultivars, from, south, america, and, egypt, resulting, in, a, range, of, colours, including, yellow, blue, and, white, lilies, that, turned, pink, with, age, in, 1902, he, increased, the, size, of, his, water, garden, by, nearly, 4000, square, metres, the, pond, was, enlarged, in, 1901, and, 1910, with, easels, installed, all, around, to, allow, different, perspectives, to, be, captured, dissatisfied, with, the, limitations, of, impressionism, monet, began, to, work, on, series, of, paintings, displaying, single, subjects, haystacks, poplars, and, the, rouen, cathedral, to, resolve, his, frustration, these, series, of, paintings, provided, widespread, critical, and, financial, success, in, 1898, 61, paintings, were, exhibited, at, the, petit, gallery, he, also, began, a, series, of, mornings, on, the, seine, which, portrayed, the, dawn, hours, of, the, river, in, 1887, and, 1889, he, displayed, a, series, of, paintings, of, belle, le, to, rave, reviews, by, critics, monet, chose, the, location, in, the, hope, of, finding, a, new, aesthetic, language, that, bypassed, learned, formulas, one, that, would, be, both, true, to, nature, and, unique, to, him, as, an, individual, not, like, anyone, else, in, 1899, he, began, painting, the, water, lilies, that, would, occupy, him, continuously, for, the, next, 20, years, of, his, life, being, his, last, and, most, ambitious, sequence, of, paintings, he, had, exhibited, this, first, group, of, pictures, of, the, garden, devoted, primarily, to, his, japanese, bridge, in, 1900, he, returned, to, london, now, residing, at, the, prestigious, savoy, hotel, in, 1899, to, produce, a, series, that, included, 41, paintings, of, waterloo, bridge, 34, of, charing, cross, bridge, and, 19, of, the, house, of, parliament, monet, s, final, journey, would, be, to, venice, with, alice, in, 1908, depictions, of, the, water, lilies, with, alternating, light, and, mirror, like, reflections, became, an, integral, part, of, his, work, by, the, mid, 1910s, monet, had, achieved, a, completely, new, fluid, and, somewhat, audacious, style, of, painting, in, which, the, water, lily, pond, became, the, point, of, departure, for, an, almost, abstract, art, claude, roger, marx, noted, in, a, review, of, monet, s, successful, 1909, exhibition, of, the, first, water, lilies, series, that, he, had, reached, the, ultimate, degree, of, abstraction, and, imagination, joined, to, the, real, this, exhibition, entitled, waterlilies, a, series, of, waterscape, consisted, of, 42, canvases, his, largest, and, most, unified, series, to, date, he, would, ultimately, make, over, 250, paintings, of, the, waterlilies, at, his, house, monet, met, with, artists, writers, intellectuals, and, politicians, from, france, england, japan, and, the, united, states, in, the, summer, of, 1887, he, met, john, singer, sargent, whose, experimentation, with, figure, painting, out, of, doors, intrigued, him, the, pair, went, on, to, frequently, influence, each, other, monet, s, second, wife, alice, died, in, 1911, and, his, oldest, son, jean, who, had, married, alice, s, daughter, blanche, monet, s, particular, favourite, died, in, 1914, their, deaths, left, monet, depressed, as, blanche, cared, for, him, it, was, during, this, time, that, monet, began, to, develop, the, first, signs, of, possible, cataracts, in, 1913, monet, travelled, to, london, to, consult, the, german, ophthalmologist, richard, liebreich, he, was, prescribed, new, glasses, and, rejected, cataract, surgery, for, the, right, eye, the, next, year, monet, encouraged, by, clemenceau, made, plans, to, construct, a, new, large, studio, that, he, could, use, to, create, a, decorative, cycle, of, paintings, devoted, to, the, water, garden, in, the, following, years, his, perception, of, colour, suffered, his, broad, strokes, were, broader, and, his, paintings, were, increasingly, darker, to, achieve, his, desired, outcome, he, began, to, label, his, tubes, of, paint, kept, a, strict, order, on, his, palette, and, wore, a, straw, hat, to, negate, glare, he, approached, painting, by, formulating, the, ideas, and, features, in, his, mind, taking, the, motif, in, large, masses, and, transcribing, them, through, memory, and, imagination, this, was, due, to, him, being, insensitive, to, the, finer, shades, of, tonalities, and, colors, seen, close, up, monet, s, output, decreased, as, he, became, withdrawn, although, he, did, produce, several, panel, paintings, for, the, french, government, from, 1914, to, 1918, to, great, financial, success, and, he, would, later, create, works, for, the, state, his, work, on, the, cycle, of, paintings, mostly, occurred, around, 1916, to, 1921, cataract, surgery, was, once, again, recommended, this, time, by, clemenceau, monet, who, was, apprehensive, following, honor, daumier, and, mary, cassatt, s, botched, surgeries, stated, that, he, would, rather, have, poor, sight, and, perhaps, abandon, painting, than, forego, a, little, of, these, things, that, i, love, in, 1919, monet, began, a, series, of, landscape, paintings, in, full, force, although, he, was, not, pleased, with, the, outcome, by, october, the, weather, caused, monet, to, cease, plein, air, painting, and, the, next, month, he, sold, four, of, the, eleven, water, lilies, paintings, despite, his, then, reluctance, to, relinquish, his, work, the, series, inspired, praise, from, his, peers, his, later, works, were, well, received, by, dealers, and, collectors, and, he, received, 200, 000, francs, from, one, collector, in, 1922, a, prescription, of, mydriatics, provided, short, lived, relief, he, eventually, underwent, cataract, surgery, in, 1923, persistent, cyanopsia, and, aphakic, spectacles, proved, to, be, a, struggle, now, able, to, see, the, real, colours, he, began, to, destroy, canvases, from, his, pre, operative, period, upon, receiving, tinted, zeiss, lenses, monet, was, laudatory, although, his, left, eye, soon, had, to, be, entirely, covered, by, a, black, lens, by, 1925, his, visual, impairment, was, improved, and, he, began, to, retouch, some, of, his, pre, operative, works, with, bluer, water, lilies, than, before, during, world, war, i, in, which, his, younger, son, michel, served, monet, painted, a, weeping, willow, series, as, homage, to, the, french, fallen, soldiers, he, became, deeply, dedicated, to, the, decorations, of, his, garden, during, the, war, monet, has, been, described, as, the, driving, force, behind, impressionism, crucial, to, the, art, of, the, impressionist, painters, was, the, understanding, of, the, effects, of, light, on, the, local, colour, of, objects, and, the, effects, of, the, juxtaposition, of, colours, with, each, other, his, free, flowing, style, and, use, of, colour, have, been, described, as, almost, ethereal, and, the, of, impressionist, style, impression, sunrise, is, an, example, of, the, fundamental, impressionist, principle, of, depicting, only, that, which, is, purely, visible, monet, was, fascinated, with, the, effects, of, light, and, painting, en, plein, air, he, believed, that, his, only, merit, lies, in, having, painted, directly, in, front, of, nature, seeking, to, render, my, impressions, of, the, most, fleeting, effects, wanting, to, paint, the, air, he, often, combined, modern, life, subjects, in, outdoor, light, monet, made, light, the, central, focus, of, his, paintings, to, capture, its, variations, he, would, sometimes, complete, a, painting, in, one, sitting, often, without, preparation, he, wished, to, demonstrate, how, light, altered, colour, and, perception, of, reality, his, interest, in, light, and, reflection, began, in, the, late, 1860s, and, lasted, throughout, his, career, during, his, first, time, in, london, he, developed, an, admiration, for, the, relationship, between, the, artist, and, motifs, for, what, he, deemed, the, envelope, he, utilised, pencil, drawings, to, quickly, note, subjects, and, motifs, for, future, reference, monet, s, portrayal, of, landscapes, emphasised, industrial, elements, such, as, railways, and, factories, his, early, seascapes, featured, brooding, nature, depicted, with, muted, colours, and, local, residents, critic, and, friend, of, monet, th, odore, duret, noted, in, 1874, that, he, was, little, attracted, by, rustic, scenes, he, particularly, drawn, towards, nature, when, it, is, embellished, and, towards, urban, scenes, and, for, preference, he, paint, flowery, gardens, parks, and, groves, when, depicting, figures, and, landscapes, in, tandem, monet, wished, for, the, landscape, to, not, be, a, mere, backdrop, and, the, figures, not, to, be, dominate, the, composition, his, dedication, to, such, a, portrayal, of, landscapes, resulted, in, monet, reprimanding, renoir, for, defying, it, he, often, depicted, the, suburban, and, rural, leisure, activities, of, paris, and, as, a, young, artist, experimented, with, still, lifes, from, the, 1870s, onwards, he, gradually, moved, away, from, suburban, and, urban, landscapes, when, they, were, depicted, it, was, to, further, his, study, of, light, contemporary, critics, and, later, academics, felt, that, with, his, choice, of, showcasing, belle, le, he, had, indicated, a, desire, to, move, away, from, the, modern, culture, of, impressionist, paintings, and, instead, towards, primitive, nature, after, meeting, boudin, monet, dedicated, himself, to, searching, for, new, and, improved, methods, of, painterly, expression, to, this, end, as, a, young, man, he, visited, the, salon, and, familiarised, himself, with, the, works, of, older, painters, and, made, friends, with, other, young, artists, the, five, years, that, he, spent, at, argenteuil, spending, much, time, on, the, river, seine, in, a, little, floating, studio, were, formative, in, his, study, of, the, effects, of, light, and, reflections, he, began, to, think, in, terms, of, colours, and, shapes, rather, than, scenes, and, objects, he, used, bright, colours, in, dabs, and, dashes, and, squiggles, of, paint, having, rejected, the, academic, teachings, of, gleyre, s, studio, he, freed, himself, from, theory, saying, i, like, to, paint, as, a, bird, sings, boudin, daubigny, jongkind, courbet, and, corot, were, among, monet, s, influences, and, he, would, often, work, in, accordance, with, developments, in, avant, garde, art, in, 1877, a, series, of, paintings, at, st, lazare, station, had, monet, looking, at, smoke, and, steam, and, the, way, that, they, affected, colour, and, visibility, being, sometimes, opaque, and, sometimes, translucent, he, was, to, further, use, this, study, in, the, painting, of, the, effects, of, mist, and, rain, on, the, landscape, the, study, of, the, effects, of, atmosphere, was, to, evolve, into, a, number, of, series, of, paintings, in, which, monet, repeatedly, painted, the, same, subject, such, as, his, water, lilies, series, in, different, lights, at, different, hours, of, the, day, and, through, the, changes, of, weather, and, season, this, process, began, in, the, 1880s, and, continued, until, the, end, of, his, life, in, 1926, in, his, later, career, monet, transcended, the, impressionist, style, and, begun, to, push, the, boundaries, of, art, monet, refined, his, palette, in, the, 1870s, consciously, minimising, the, use, of, darker, tones, and, favouring, pastel, colours, this, coincided, with, his, softer, approach, using, smaller, and, more, varied, brush, strokes, his, palette, would, again, undergo, change, in, the, 1880s, with, more, emphasis, than, before, on, harmony, between, warm, and, cold, hues, following, his, optical, operation, in, 1923, monet, returned, to, his, style, from, before, a, decade, ago, he, forwent, garish, colours, or, coarse, application, for, emphasised, colour, schemes, of, blue, and, green, whilst, suffering, from, cataracts, his, paintings, were, more, broad, and, abstract, from, the, late, 1880s, onwards, he, had, simplified, his, compositions, and, sought, subjects, which, could, offer, broad, colour, and, tone, he, increasingly, used, red, and, yellow, tones, a, trend, that, first, started, following, his, trip, to, venice, monet, often, travelled, alone, at, this, time, from, france, to, normandy, to, london, to, the, rivera, and, rouen, in, search, of, new, and, more, challenging, subjects, the, stylistic, change, was, likely, a, by, product, of, the, disorder, and, not, an, intentional, choice, monet, would, often, work, on, large, canvases, due, to, the, deterioration, of, his, eyesight, and, by, 1920, he, admitted, that, he, had, grown, too, accustomed, to, broad, painting, to, return, to, small, canvases, the, influence, of, his, cataracts, on, his, output, has, been, a, topic, of, discussion, among, academics, lane, et, al, 1997, argues, the, occurrence, of, a, deterioration, from, the, late, 1860s, onwards, led, to, a, diminishing, of, sharp, lines, gardens, were, a, focus, throughout, his, art, becoming, prominent, in, his, later, work, especially, during, the, last, decade, of, his, life, daniel, wildenstein, noted, a, seamless, continuity, in, his, paintings, that, was, enriched, by, innovation, from, the, 1880s, onwards, and, particularly, in, the, 1890s, monet, s, series, of, paintings, of, specific, subjects, sought, to, document, the, different, conditions, of, light, and, weather, as, light, and, weather, changed, throughout, the, day, he, switched, between, canvases, sometimes, working, on, as, many, as, eight, at, one, time, usually, spending, an, hour, on, each, in, 1895, he, exhibited, 20, paintings, of, rouen, cathedral, showcasing, the, fa, ade, in, different, conditions, of, light, weather, and, atmosphere, the, paintings, do, not, focus, on, the, grand, medieval, building, but, on, the, play, of, light, and, shade, across, its, surface, transforming, the, solid, masonry, for, this, series, he, experimented, with, creating, his, own, frames, his, first, series, exhibited, was, of, haystacks, painted, from, different, points, of, view, and, at, different, times, of, the, day, fifteen, of, the, paintings, were, exhibited, at, the, galerie, durand, ruel, in, 1891, in, 1892, he, produced, twenty, six, views, of, rouen, cathedral, between, 1883, and, 1908, monet, travelled, to, the, mediterranean, where, he, painted, landmarks, landscapes, and, seascapes, including, a, series, of, paintings, in, venice, in, london, he, painted, four, series, the, houses, of, parliament, london, charing, cross, bridge, waterloo, bridge, and, views, of, westminster, bridge, helen, gardner, writes, monet, with, a, scientific, precision, has, given, us, an, unparalleled, and, unexcelled, record, of, the, passing, of, time, as, seen, in, the, movement, of, light, over, identical, forms, following, his, return, from, london, monet, painted, mostly, from, nature, in, his, own, garden, its, water, lilies, its, pond, and, its, bridge, from, 22, november, to, 15, december, 1900, another, exhibition, dedicated, to, him, was, held, at, the, durand, ruel, gallery, with, around, ten, versions, of, the, water, lilies, exhibited, this, same, exhibition, was, organized, in, february, 1901, in, new, york, city, where, it, was, met, with, great, success, in, 1901, monet, enlarged, the, pond, of, his, home, by, buying, a, meadow, located, on, the, other, side, of, the, ru, the, local, watercourse, he, then, divided, his, time, between, work, on, nature, and, work, in, his, studio, the, canvases, dedicated, to, the, water, lilies, evolved, with, the, changes, made, to, his, garden, in, addition, around, 1905, monet, gradually, modified, his, aesthetics, by, abandoning, the, perimeter, of, the, body, of, water, and, therefore, modifying, perspective, he, also, changed, the, shape, and, size, of, his, canvases, by, moving, from, rectangular, stretchers, to, square, and, then, circular, stretchers, these, canvases, were, created, with, great, difficulty, monet, spent, a, significant, amount, of, time, reworking, them, in, order, to, find, the, perfect, effects, and, impressions, when, he, deemed, them, unsuccessful, he, did, not, hesitate, to, destroy, them, he, continually, postponed, the, durand, ruel, exhibition, until, he, was, satisfied, with, the, works, after, several, postponements, dating, back, to, 1906, the, exhibition, titled, les, nymph, as, ended, up, opening, on, 6, may, 1909, comprising, forty, eight, paintings, dating, from, 1903, to, 1908, representing, a, series, of, landscapes, and, water, lily, scenes, this, exhibition, was, once, again, a, success, monet, died, of, lung, cancer, on, 5, december, 1926, at, the, age, of, 86, and, is, buried, in, the, giverny, church, cemetery, monet, had, insisted, that, the, occasion, be, simple, thus, only, about, fifty, people, attended, the, ceremony, at, his, funeral, clemenceau, removed, the, black, cloth, draped, over, the, coffin, stating, no, black, for, monet, and, replaced, it, with, a, flower, patterned, cloth, at, the, time, of, his, death, waterlilies, was, technically, unfinished, monet, s, home, garden, and, water, lily, pond, were, bequeathed, by, michel, to, the, french, academy, of, fine, arts, part, of, the, institut, de, france, in, 1966, through, the, fondation, claude, monet, the, house, and, gardens, were, opened, for, visits, in, 1980, following, restoration, in, addition, to, souvenirs, of, monet, and, other, objects, of, his, life, the, house, contains, his, collection, of, japanese, woodcut, prints, which, had, a, pronounced, influence, on, his, art, the, house, and, garden, along, with, the, museum, of, impressionism, are, major, attractions, in, giverny, which, hosts, tourists, from, all, over, the, world, speaking, of, monet, s, body, of, work, wildenstein, said, that, it, is, so, extensive, that, its, very, ambition, and, diversity, challenges, our, understanding, of, its, importance, his, paintings, produced, at, giverny, and, under, the, influence, of, cataracts, have, been, said, to, create, a, link, between, impressionism, and, twentieth, century, art, and, modern, abstract, art, respectively, his, later, works, were, a, major, inspiration, to, objective, abstraction, ellsworth, kelly, following, a, formative, experience, at, giverny, paid, homage, to, monet, s, works, created, there, with, tableau, vert, 1952, monet, has, been, called, an, intermediary, between, tradition, and, modernism, his, work, has, been, examined, in, relation, to, postmodernism, and, was, an, influence, to, bazille, sisley, renoir, and, pissarro, monet, is, now, the, most, famous, of, the, impressionists, as, a, result, of, his, contributions, to, the, movement, he, exerted, a, huge, influence, on, late, 19th, century, art, in, may, 1927, 27, panel, paintings, were, displayed, in, the, mus, e, de, l, orangerie, following, lengthy, negotiations, with, the, french, government, due, to, his, later, works, being, ignored, by, artists, art, historians, critics, and, the, public, few, attended, the, showing, in, the, 1950s, monet, s, later, works, were, rediscovered, by, the, abstract, expressionists, and, those, adjacent, like, clement, greenberg, who, used, a, similar, canvases, and, held, a, disinterest, in, the, blunt, and, ideological, art, of, the, war, a, 1952, essay, by, andr, masson, helped, change, the, perception, of, the, paintings, and, inspire, appreciation, that, began, to, take, shape, in, 1956, 1957, the, next, year, a, fire, in, the, museum, of, modern, art, would, see, the, water, lilies, paintings, acquired, by, them, burn, the, large, scale, nature, of, monet, s, later, paintings, proved, to, be, difficult, for, some, museums, which, resulted, in, them, altering, the, framing, in, 1978, monet, s, garden, in, giverny, which, had, grown, decrepit,
