menander, m, n, n, d, r, greek, menandros, c, 342, 41, c, 290, bc, was, a, greek, dramatist, and, the, best, known, representative, of, athenian, new, comedy, he, wrote, 108, comedies, and, took, the, prize, at, the, lenaia, festival, eight, times, his, record, at, the, city, dionysia, is, unknown, he, was, one, of, the, most, popular, writers, and, most, highly, admired, poets, in, antiquity, but, his, work, was, considered, lost, before, the, early, middle, ages, it, now, survives, only, in, latin, language, adaptations, by, terence, and, plautus, and, in, the, original, greek, in, highly, fragmentary, form, most, of, which, were, discovered, on, papyrus, in, egyptian, tombs, during, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, in, the, 1950s, to, the, great, excitement, of, classicists, it, was, announced, that, a, single, play, by, menander, dyskolos, had, finally, been, rediscovered, in, the, bodmer, papyri, intact, enough, to, be, performed, menander, was, the, son, of, well, to, do, parents, his, father, diopeithes, is, identified, by, some, with, the, athenian, general, and, governor, of, the, thracian, chersonese, known, from, the, speech, of, demosthenes, de, chersoneso, he, presumably, derived, his, taste, for, comic, drama, from, his, uncle, alexis, he, was, the, friend, associate, and, perhaps, pupil, of, theophrastus, and, was, on, intimate, terms, with, the, athenian, dictator, demetrius, of, phalerum, he, also, enjoyed, the, patronage, of, ptolemy, soter, the, son, of, lagus, who, invited, him, to, his, court, but, menander, preferring, the, independence, of, his, villa, in, the, piraeus, and, the, company, of, his, mistress, glycera, refused, according, to, the, note, of, a, scholiast, on, the, ibis, of, ovid, he, drowned, while, bathing, and, his, countrymen, honored, him, with, a, tomb, on, the, road, leading, to, athens, where, it, was, seen, by, pausanias, numerous, supposed, busts, of, him, survive, including, a, well, known, statue, in, the, vatican, formerly, thought, to, represent, gaius, marius, his, rival, in, dramatic, art, and, supposedly, in, the, affections, of, glycera, was, philemon, who, appears, to, have, been, more, popular, menander, however, believed, himself, to, be, the, better, dramatist, and, according, to, aulus, gellius, used, to, ask, philemon, don, t, you, feel, ashamed, whenever, you, gain, a, victory, over, me, according, to, caecilius, of, calacte, porphyry, in, eusebius, praeparatio, evangelica, menander, was, accused, of, plagiarism, as, his, the, superstitious, man, was, taken, from, the, augur, of, antiphanes, but, reworkings, and, variations, on, a, theme, of, this, sort, were, commonplace, and, so, the, charge, is, a, complicated, one, how, long, complete, copies, of, his, plays, survived, is, unclear, although, 23, of, them, with, commentary, by, michael, psellus, were, said, to, still, have, been, available, in, constantinople, in, the, 11th, century, he, is, praised, by, plutarch, comparison, of, menander, and, aristophanes, and, quintilian, institutio, oratoria, who, accepted, the, tradition, that, he, was, the, author, of, the, speeches, published, under, the, name, of, the, attic, orator, charisius, an, admirer, and, imitator, of, euripides, menander, resembles, him, in, his, keen, observation, of, practical, life, his, analysis, of, the, emotions, and, his, fondness, for, moral, maxims, many, of, which, became, proverbial, the, property, of, friends, is, common, whom, the, gods, love, die, young, evil, communications, corrupt, good, manners, from, the, tha, s, quoted, in, 1, corinthians, 15, 33, these, maxims, chiefly, monostichs, were, afterwards, collected, and, with, additions, from, other, sources, were, edited, as, menander, s, one, verse, maxims, a, kind, of, moral, textbook, for, the, use, of, schools, the, single, surviving, speech, from, his, early, play, drunkenness, is, an, attack, on, the, politician, callimedon, in, the, manner, of, aristophanes, whose, bawdy, style, was, adopted, in, many, of, his, plays, menander, found, many, roman, imitators, eunuchus, andria, heauton, timorumenos, and, adelphi, of, terence, called, by, caesar, dimidiatus, menander, were, avowedly, taken, from, menander, but, some, of, them, appear, to, be, adaptations, and, combinations, of, more, than, one, play, thus, in, the, andria, were, combined, menander, s, the, woman, from, andros, and, the, woman, from, perinthos, in, the, eunuchus, the, eunuch, and, the, flatterer, while, the, adelphi, was, compiled, partly, from, menander, and, partly, from, diphilus, the, original, of, terence, s, hecyra, as, of, the, phormio, is, generally, supposed, to, be, not, by, menander, but, apollodorus, of, carystus, the, bacchides, and, stichus, of, plautus, were, probably, based, upon, menander, s, the, double, deceiver, and, brotherly, loving, men, but, the, poenulus, does, not, seem, to, be, from, the, carthaginian, nor, the, mostellaria, from, the, apparition, in, spite, of, the, similarity, of, titles, caecilius, statius, luscius, lanuvinus, turpilius, and, atilius, also, imitated, menander, he, was, further, credited, with, the, authorship, of, some, epigrams, of, doubtful, authenticity, the, letters, addressed, to, ptolemy, soter, and, the, discourses, in, prose, on, various, subjects, mentioned, by, the, suda, are, probably, spurious, most, of, menander, s, work, did, not, survive, the, middle, ages, except, as, short, fragments, federico, da, montefeltro, s, library, at, urbino, reputedly, had, tutte, le, opere, a, complete, works, but, its, existence, has, been, questioned, and, there, are, no, traces, after, cesare, borgia, s, capture, of, the, city, and, the, transfer, of, the, library, to, the, vatican, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, all, that, was, known, of, menander, were, fragments, quoted, by, other, authors, and, collected, by, augustus, meineke, 1855, and, theodor, kock, comicorum, atticorum, fragmenta, 1888, these, consist, of, some, 1650, verses, or, parts, of, verses, in, addition, to, a, considerable, number, of, words, quoted, from, menander, by, ancient, lexicographers, this, situation, changed, abruptly, in, 1907, with, the, discovery, of, the, cairo, codex, which, contained, large, parts, of, the, samia, the, perikeiromene, and, the, epitrepontes, a, section, of, the, heros, and, another, fragment, from, an, unidentified, play, a, fragment, of, 115, lines, of, the, sikyonioi, had, been, found, in, the, papier, mache, of, a, mummy, case, in,

for, two, more, mummy, cases, this, proved, to, be, drawn, from, the, same, manuscript, as, the, discovery, in, 1906, which, had, clearly, been, thoroughly, recycled, other, papyrus, fragments, continue, to, be, discovered, and, published, in, 2003, a, palimpsest, manuscript, in, syriac, writing, of, the, 9th, century, was, found, where, the, reused, parchment, comes, from, a, very,
