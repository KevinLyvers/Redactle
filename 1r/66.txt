their, act, he, first, met, george, gershwin, who, was, working, as, a, song, plugger, for, jerome, h, remick, s, music, publishing, company, in, 1916, astaire, had, already, been, hunting, for, new, music, and, dance, ideas, their, chance, meeting, was, to, affect, the, careers, of, both, artists, profoundly, astaire, was, always, on, the, lookout, for, new, steps, on, the, circuit, and, was, starting, to, demonstrate, his, quest, for, novelty, and, perfection, the, astaires, broke, into, broadway, in, 1917, with, over, the, top, a, patriotic, revue, and, performed, for, u, s, and, allied, troops, at, this, time, as, well, they, followed, up, with, several, more, shows, of, their, work, in, the, passing, show, of, 1918, heywood, broun, wrote, in, an, evening, in, which, there, was, an, abundance, of, good, dancing, fred, astaire, stood, out, he, and, his, partner, adele, astaire, made, the, show, pause, early, in, the, evening, with, a, beautiful, loose, limbed, dance, adele, s, sparkle, and, humor, drew, much, of, the, attention, owing, in, part, to, fred, s, careful, preparation, and, sharp, supporting, choreography, she, still, set, the, tone, of, their, act, but, by, this, time, astaire, s, dancing, skill, was, beginning, to, outshine, his, sister, s, during, the, 1920s, fred, and, adele, appeared, on, broadway, and, the, london, stage, they, won, popular, acclaim, with, the, theater, crowd, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, in, shows, such, as, jerome, kern, s, the, bunch, and, judy, 1922, george, and, ira, gershwin, s, lady, be, good, 1924, and, funny, face, 1927, and, later, in, the, band, wagon, 1931, astaire, s, tap, dancing, was, recognized, by, then, as, among, the, best, for, example, robert, benchley, wrote, in, 1930, i, don, t, think, that, i, will, plunge, the, nation, into, war, by, stating, that, fred, is, the, greatest, tap, dancer, in, the, world, while, in, london, fred, studied, piano, at, the, guildhall, school, of, music, alongside, his, friend, and, colleague, no, l, coward, and, in, 1926, was, one, of, the, judges, at, the, charleston, championship, of, the, world, competition, at, the, royal, albert, hall, where, lew, grade, was, declared, the, winner, after, the, close, of, funny, face, the, astaires, went, to, hollywood, for, a, screen, test, now, lost, at, paramount, pictures, but, paramount, deemed, them, unsuitable, for, films, they, split, in, 1932, when, adele, married, her, first, husband, lord, charles, cavendish, the, second, son, of, the, 9th, duke, of, devonshire, fred, went, on, to, achieve, success, on, his, own, on, broadway, and, in, london, with, gay, divorce, later, made, into, the, film, the, gay, divorcee, while, considering, offers, from, hollywood, the, end, of, the, partnership, was, traumatic, for, astaire, but, stimulated, him, to, expand, his, range, free, of, the, brother, sister, constraints, of, the, former, pairing, and, working, with, new, partner, claire, luce, fred, created, a, romantic, partnered, dance, to, cole, porter, s, night, and, day, which, had, been, written, for, gay, divorce, luce, stated, that, she, had, to, encourage, him, to, take, a, more, romantic, approach, come, on, fred, i, m, not, your, sister, you, know, 6, the, success, of, the, stage, play, was, credited, to, this, number, and, when, recreated, in, the, gay, divorcee, 1934, the, film, version, of, the, play, it, ushered, in, a, new, era, in, filmed, dance, 23, 26, 61, recently, film, footage, taken, by, fred, stone, of, astaire, performing, in, gay, divorce, with, luce, s, successor, dorothy, stone, in, new, york, in, 1933, was, uncovered, by, dancer, and, historian, betsy, baytos, and, now, represents, the, earliest, known, performance, footage, of, astaire, according, to, hollywood, folklore, a, screen, test, report, on, astaire, for, rko, radio, pictures, now, lost, along, with, the, test, is, reported, to, have, read, can, t, sing, can, t, act, balding, can, dance, a, little, the, producer, of, the, astaire, rogers, pictures, pandro, s, berman, claimed, he, had, never, heard, the, story, in, the, 1930s, and, that, it, only, emerged, years, afterward, 7, astaire, later, clarified, insisting, that, the, report, had, read, can, t, act, slightly, bald, also, dances, in, any, case, the, test, was, clearly, disappointing, and, david, o, selznick, who, had, signed, astaire, to, rko, and, commissioned, the, test, stated, in, a, memo, i, am, uncertain, about, the, man, but, i, feel, in, spite, of, his, enormous, ears, and, bad, chin, line, that, his, charm, is, so, tremendous, that, it, comes, through, even, on, this, wretched, test, 7, however, this, did, not, affect, rko, s, plans, for, astaire, they, lent, him, for, a, few, days, to, mgm, in, 1933, for, his, significant, hollywood, debut, in, the, successful, musical, film, dancing, lady, in, the, movie, he, appeared, as, himself, dancing, with, joan, crawford, on, his, return, to, rko, he, got, fifth, billing, after, fourth, billed, ginger, rogers, in, the, 1933, dolores, del, r, o, vehicle, flying, down, to, rio, in, a, review, variety, magazine, attributed, its, massive, success, to, astaire, s, presence, the, main, point, of, flying, down, to, rio, is, the, screen, promise, of, fred, astaire, he, s, assuredly, a, bet, after, this, one, for, he, s, distinctly, likable, on, the, screen, the, mike, is, kind, to, his, voice, and, as, a, dancer, he, remains, in, a, class, by, himself, the, latter, observation, will, be, no, news, to, the, profession, which, has, long, admitted, that, astaire, starts, dancing, where, the, others, stop, hoofing, 7, having, already, been, linked, to, his, sister, adele, on, stage, astaire, was, initially, very, reluctant, to, become, part, of, another, dance, team, he, wrote, his, agent, i, don, t, mind, making, another, picture, with, her, but, as, for, this, team, idea, it, s, out, i, ve, just, managed, to, live, down, one, partnership, and, i, don, t, want, to, be, bothered, with, any, more, 8, however, he, was, persuaded, by, the, apparent, public, appeal, of, the, astaire, rogers, pairing, the, partnership, and, the, choreography, of, astaire, and, hermes, pan, helped, make, dancing, an, important, element, of, the, hollywood, film, musical, astaire, and, rogers, made, nine, films, together, at, rko, flying, down, to, rio, 1933, the, gay, divorcee, 1934, roberta, 1935, in, which, astaire, also, demonstrates, his, oft, overlooked, piano, skills, with, a, spirited, solo, on, i, won, t, dance, top, hat, 1935, follow, the, fleet, 1936, swing, time, 1936, shall, we, dance, 1937, carefree, 1938, and, the, story, of, vernon, and, irene, castle, 1939, six, out, of, the, nine, astaire, rogers, musicals, became, the, biggest, moneymakers, for, rko, all, of, the, films, brought, a, certain, prestige, and, artistry, that, all, studios, coveted, at, the, time, their, partnership, elevated, them, both, to, stardom, as, katharine, hepburn, reportedly, said, he, gives, her, class, and, she, gives, him, sex, appeal, 134, astaire, received, a, percentage, of, the, films, profits, something, scarce, in, actors, contracts, at, that, time, astaire, revolutionized, dance, on, film, by, having, complete, autonomy, over, its, presentation, he, is, credited, with, two, important, innovations, in, early, film, musicals, 23, 26, first, he, insisted, that, a, closely, tracking, dolly, camera, film, a, dance, routine, in, as, few, shots, as, possible, typically, with, just, four, to, eight, cuts, while, holding, the, dancers, in, full, view, at, all, times, this, gave, the, illusion, of, an, almost, stationary, camera, filming, an, entire, dance, in, a, single, shot, astaire, famously, quipped, either, the, camera, will, dance, or, i, will, 420, astaire, maintained, this, policy, from, the, gay, divorcee, in, 1934, until, his, last, film, musical, finian, s, rainbow, in, 1968, when, director, francis, ford, coppola, overruled, him, astaire, s, style, of, dance, sequences, allowed, the, viewer, to, follow, the, dancers, and, choreography, in, their, entirety, this, style, differed, strikingly, from, those, in, the, busby, berkeley, musicals, those, musicals, sequences, were, filled, with, extravagant, aerial, shots, dozens, of, cuts, for, quick, takes, and, zooms, on, areas, of, the, body, such, as, a, chorus, row, of, arms, or, legs, astaire, s, second, innovation, involved, the, context, of, the, dance, he, was, adamant, that, all, song, and, dance, routines, be, integral, to, the, plotlines, of, the, film, instead, of, using, dance, as, a, spectacle, as, busby, berkeley, did, astaire, used, it, to, move, the, plot, along, typically, an, astaire, picture, would, include, at, least, three, standard, dances, one, would, be, a, solo, performance, by, astaire, which, he, termed, his, sock, solo, another, would, be, a, partnered, comedy, dance, routine, finally, he, would, include, a, partnered, romantic, dance, routine, dance, commentators, arlene, croce, 6, hannah, hyam, 146, 147, and, john, mueller, 8, 9, consider, rogers, to, have, been, astaire, s, greatest, dance, partner, a, view, shared, by, hermes, pan, and, stanley, donen, film, critic, pauline, kael, adopts, a, more, neutral, stance, while, time, magazine, film, critic, richard, schickel, writes, the, nostalgia, surrounding, rogers, astaire, tends, to, bleach, out, other, partners, mueller, sums, up, rogers, s, abilities, as, follows, rogers, was, outstanding, among, astaire, s, partners, not, because, she, was, superior, to, others, as, a, dancer, but, because, as, a, skilled, intuitive, actress, she, was, cagey, enough, to, realize, that, acting, did, not, stop, when, dancing, began, the, reason, so, many, women, have, fantasized, about, dancing, with, fred, astaire, is, that, ginger, rogers, conveyed, the, impression, that, dancing, with, him, is, the, most, thrilling, experience, imaginable, according, to, astaire, ginger, had, never, danced, with, a, partner, before, flying, down, to, rio, she, faked, it, an, awful, lot, she, couldn, t, tap, and, she, couldn, t, do, this, and, that, but, ginger, had, style, and, talent, and, improved, as, she, went, along, she, got, so, that, after, a, while, everyone, else, who, danced, with, me, looked, wrong, on, p, 162, of, his, book, ginger, salute, to, a, star, author, dick, richards, quotes, astaire, saying, to, raymond, rohauer, curator, of, the, new, york, gallery, of, modern, art, ginger, was, brilliantly, effective, she, made, everything, work, for, her, actually, she, made, things, very, fine, for, both, of, us, and, she, deserves, most, of, the, credit, for, our, success, in, 1976, british, talk, show, host, michael, parkinson, asked, astaire, who, his, favorite, dancing, partner, was, on, parkinson, at, first, astaire, refused, to, answer, but, ultimately, he, said, excuse, me, i, must, say, ginger, was, certainly, the, one, you, know, the, most, effective, partner, i, ever, had, everyone, knows, rogers, described, astaire, s, uncompromising, standards, extending, to, the, whole, production, sometimes, he, ll, think, of, a, new, line, of, dialogue, or, a, new, angle, for, the, story, they, never, know, what, time, of, night, he, ll, call, up, and, start, ranting, enthusiastically, about, a, fresh, idea, no, loafing, on, the, job, on, an, astaire, picture, and, no, cutting, corners, 16, despite, their, success, astaire, was, unwilling, to, have, his, career, tied, exclusively, to, any, partnership, he, negotiated, with, rko, to, strike, out, on, his, own, with, a, damsel, in, distress, in, 1937, with, an, inexperienced, non, dancing, joan, fontaine, unsuccessfully, as, it, turned, out, he, returned, to, make, two, more, films, with, rogers, carefree, 1938, and, the, story, of, vernon, and, irene, castle, 1939, while, both, films, earned, respectable, gross, incomes, they, both, lost, money, because, of, increased, production, costs, 410, and, astaire, left, rko, after, being, labeled, box, office, poison, by, the, independent, theatre, owners, of, america, astaire, was, reunited, with, rogers, in, 1949, at, mgm, for, their, final, outing, the, barkleys, of, broadway, the, only, one, of, their, films, together, to, be, shot, in, technicolor, astaire, left, rko, in, 1939, to, freelance, and, pursue, new, film, opportunities, with, mixed, though, generally, successful, outcomes, throughout, this, period, astaire, continued, to, value, the, input, of, choreographic, collaborators, unlike, the, 1930s, when, he, worked, almost, exclusively, with, hermes, pan, he, tapped, the, talents, of, other, choreographers, to, innovate, continually, his, first, post, ginger, dance, partner, was, the, redoubtable, eleanor, powell, considered, the, most, exceptional, female, tap, dancer, of, her, generation, they, starred, in, broadway, melody, of, 1940, in, which, they, performed, a, celebrated, extended, dance, routine, to, cole, porter, s, begin, the, beguine, in, his, autobiography, steps, in, time, astaire, remarked, she, put, em, down, like, a, man, no, ricky, ticky, sissy, stuff, with, ellie, she, really, knocked, out, a, tap, dance, in, a, class, by, herself, he, played, alongside, bing, crosby, in, holiday, inn, 1942, and, later, blue, skies, 1946, but, in, spite, of, the, enormous, financial, success, of, both, he, was, reportedly, dissatisfied, with, roles, where, he, lost, the, girl, to, crosby, the, former, film, is, memorable, for, his, virtuoso, solo, dance, to, let, s, say, it, with, firecrackers, the, latter, film, featured, puttin, on, the, ritz, an, innovative, song, and, dance, routine, indelibly, associated, with, him, other, partners, during, this, period, included, paulette, goddard, in, second, chorus, 1940, in, which, he, dance, conducted, the, artie, shaw, orchestra, he, made, two, pictures, with, rita, hayworth, the, first, film, you, ll, never, get, rich, 1941, catapulted, hayworth, to, stardom, in, the, movie, astaire, integrated, for, the, third, time, latin, american, dance, idioms, into, his, style, the, first, being, with, ginger, rogers, in, the, carioca, number, from, flying, down, to, rio, 1933, and, the, second, again, with, rogers, was, the, dengozo, dance, from, the, story, of, vernon, and, irene, castle, 1939, his, second, film, with, hayworth, you, were, never, lovelier, 1942, was, equally, successful, it, featured, a, duet,

troubled, routine, astaire, choreographed, this, film, alone, and, achieved, modest, box, office, success, it, represented, a, notable, departure, for, astaire, from, his, usual, charming, happy, go, lucky, screen, persona, and, confused, contemporary, critics, his, next, partner, lucille, bremer, was, featured, in, two, lavish, vehicles, both, directed, by, vincente, minnelli, the, fantasy,

a, role, for, him, on, galactica, because, of, his, grandchildren, s, interest, in, the, series, and, the, producers, were, delighted, at, the, opportunity, to, create, an, entire, episode, to,

suit, in, 1979, his, final, film, was, the, 1981, adaptation, of, peter, straub, s, novel, ghost, story, this, horror, film, was, also, the, last, for, two, of, his, most, prominent, castmates, melvyn, douglas, and, douglas, fairbanks, jr, astaire, was, a, virtuoso, dancer, able, when, called, for, to, convey, light, hearted, venturesomeness, or, deep, emotion, his, technical, control, and, sense, of, rhythm, were, astonishing, long, after, the, photography, for, the, solo, dance, number, i, wanna, be, a, dancin, man, was, completed, for, the, 1952, feature, the, belle, of, new, york, it, was, decided, that, astaire, s, humble, costume, and, the, threadbare, stage, set, were, inadequate, and, the, entire, sequence, was, reshot, the, 1994, documentary, that, s, entertainment, iii, shows, the, two, performances, side, by, side, in, split, screen, frame, for, frame, the, two, performances, are, identical, down, to, the, subtlest, gesture, astaire, s, execution, of, a, dance, routine, was, prized, for, its, elegance, grace, originality, and, precision, he, drew, from, a, variety, of, influences, including, tap, classical, dance, and, the, elevated, style, of, vernon, and, irene, castle, his, was, a, uniquely, recognizable, dance, style, that, greatly, influenced, the, american, smooth, style, of, ballroom, dance, and, set, standards, against, which, subsequent, film, dance, musicals, would, be, judged, he, termed, his, eclectic, approach, outlaw, style, an, unpredictable, and, instinctive, blending, of, personal, artistry, his, dances, are, economical, yet, endlessly, nuanced, as, jerome, robbins, stated, astaire, s, dancing, looks, so, simple, so, disarming, so, easy, yet, the, understructure, the, way, he, sets, the, steps, on, over, or, against, the, music, is, so, surprising, and, inventive, 18, astaire, further, observed, working, out, the, steps, is, a, very, complicated, process, something, like, writing, music, you, have, to, think, of, some, step, that, flows, into, the, next, one, and, the, whole, dance, must, have, an, integrated, pattern, if, the, dance, is, right, there, shouldn, t, be, a, single, superfluous, movement, it, should, build, to, a, climax, and, stop, 15, although, astaire, was, the, primary, choreographer, of, all, his, dance, routines, he, welcomed, the, input, of, collaborators, and, notably, his, principal, collaborator, hermes, pan, but, dance, historian, john, mueller, believes, that, astaire, acted, as, the, lead, choreographer, in, his, solos, and, partnered, dances, throughout, his, career, he, notes, astaire, s, dance, style, was, consistent, in, subsequent, films, made, with, or, without, the, assistance, of, pan, furthermore, astaire, choreographed, all, the, routines, during, his, broadway, career, with, his, sister, adele, frequently, a, dance, sequence, was, built, around, two, or, three, key, ideas, sometimes, inspired, by, his, steps, or, by, the, music, itself, suggesting, a, particular, mood, or, action, 20, caron, said, that, while, kelly, danced, close, to, the, ground, she, felt, like, she, was, floating, with, astaire, many, dance, routines, were, built, around, a, gimmick, like, dancing, on, the, walls, in, royal, wedding, or, dancing, with, his, shadows, in, swing, time, he, or, his, collaborator, would, think, of, these, routines, earlier, and, save, them, for, the, right, situation, they, would, spend, weeks, creating, all, the, dance, sequences, in, a, secluded, rehearsal, space, before, filming, would, begin, they, would, work, with, a, rehearsal, pianist, often, the, composer, hal, borne, who, in, turn, would, communicate, modifications, to, the, musical, orchestrators, his, perfectionism, was, legendary, but, his, relentless, insistence, on, rehearsals, and, retakes, was, a, burden, to, some, when, time, approached, for, the, shooting, of, a, number, astaire, would, rehearse, for, another, two, weeks, and, record, the, singing, and, music, with, all, the, preparation, completed, the, actual, shooting, would, go, quickly, conserving, costs, astaire, agonized, during, the, process, frequently, asking, colleagues, for, acceptance, for, his, work, as, vincente, minnelli, stated, he, lacks, confidence, to, the, most, enormous, degree, of, all, the, people, in, the, world, he, will, not, even, go, to, see, his, rushes, he, always, thinks, he, is, no, good, 16, as, astaire, himself, observed, i, ve, never, yet, got, anything, 100, right, still, it, s, never, as, bad, as, i, think, it, is, 16, michael, kidd, astaire, s, co, choreographer, on, the, 1953, film, the, band, wagon, found, that, his, own, concern, about, the, emotional, motivation, behind, the, dance, was, not, shared, by, astaire, kidd, later, recounted, technique, was, important, to, him, he, d, say, let, s, do, the, steps, let, s, add, the, looks, later, extremely, modest, about, his, singing, abilities, he, frequently, claimed, that, he, could, not, sing, but, the, critics, rated, him, as, among, the, finest, astaire, introduced, some, of, the, most, celebrated, songs, from, the, great, american, songbook, in, particular, cole, porter, s, night, and, day, in, gay, divorce, 1932, so, near, and, yet, so, far, in, you, ll, never, get, rich, 1941, irving, berlin, s, isn, t, this, a, lovely, day, cheek, to, cheek, and, top, hat, white, tie, and, tails, in, top, hat, 1935, let, s, face, the, music, and, dance, in, follow, the, fleet, 1936, and, change, partners, in, carefree, 1938, he, first, presented, jerome, kern, s, the, way, you, look, tonight, in, swing, time, 1936, the, gershwins, they, can, t, take, that, away, from, me, in, shall, we, dance, 1937, a, foggy, day, and, nice, work, if, you, can, get, it, in, a, damsel, in, distress, 1937, johnny, mercer, s, one, for, my, baby, from, the, sky, s, the, limit, 1943, something, s, gotta, give, from, daddy, long, legs, 1955, and, harry, warren, and, arthur, freed, s, this, heart, of, mine, from, ziegfeld, follies, 1946, astaire, also, co, introduced, a, number, of, song, classics, via, song, duets, with, his, partners, for, example, with, his, sister, adele, he, co,

swing, time, 1936, along, with, the, gershwins, let, s, call, the, whole, thing, off, from, shall, we, dance, 1937, with, judy, garland, he, sang, irving, berlin, s, a, couple, of, swells, from, easter, parade, 1948, and, with, jack, buchanan, oscar, levant, and, nanette, fabray, he, delivered, arthur, schwartz, s, and, howard, dietz, s, that, s, entertainment, from, the, band, wagon, 1953, although, he, possessed, a, light, voice, he, was, admired, for, his, lyricism, diction, and, phrasing, the, grace, and, elegance, so, prized, in, his, dancing, seemed, to, be, reflected, in, his, singing, a, capacity, for, synthesis, which, led, burton, lane, to, describe, him, as, the, world, s, greatest, musical, performer, 21, irving, berlin, considered, astaire, the, equal, of, any, male, interpreter, of, his, songs, as, good, as, jolson, crosby, or, sinatra, not, necessarily, because, of, his, voice, but, for, his, conception, of, projecting, a, song, jerome, kern, considered, him, the, supreme, male, interpreter, of, his, songs, 21, and, while, george, gershwin, was, somewhat, critical, of, astaire, s, singing, abilities, he, wrote, many, of, his, most, memorable, songs, for, him, 123, 128, in, his, heyday, astaire, was, referenced, in, lyrics, of, songwriters, cole, porter, lorenz, hart, and, eric, maschwitz, and, continues, to, inspire, modern, songwriters, astaire, was,
