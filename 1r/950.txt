ad, he, is, considered, to, be, the, first, of, the, apostolic, fathers, of, the, church, and, a, leading, member, of, the, church, in, rome, in, the, late, 1st, century, little, is, known, about, clement, s, life, tertullian, claimed, that, clement, was, ordained, by, saint, peter, early, church, lists, place, him, as, the, second, or, third, bishop, of, rome, eusebius, in, his, book, church, history, mentioned, clement, as, the, third, bishop, of, rome, and, as, the, co, laborer, of, paul, in, against, heresies, irenaeus, describes, clement, as, the, successor, to, anacletus, third, bishop, of, rome, and, a, personal, acquaintance, of, the, apostles, according, to, the, annuario, pontificio, clement, was, the, fourth, bishop, of, rome, holding, office, at, the, very, end, of, the, 1st, century, it, is, likely, that, clement, died, in, exile, and, was, possibly, martyred, according, to, apocryphal, stories, dating, back, to, the, 4th, century, by, authors, such, as, rufinus, clement, was, imprisoned, by, roman, emperor, trajan, and, was, executed, by, being, tied, to, an, anchor, and, thrown, into, the, sea, the, liber, pontificalis, states, that, clement, died, in, greece, in, the, third, year, of, trajan, s, reign, or, 100, ad, the, only, known, genuine, extant, writing, of, clement, is, his, letter, to, the, church, at, corinth, 1, clement, in, response, to, a, dispute, in, which, certain, presbyters, of, the, corinthian, church, had, been, deposed, he, asserted, the, authority, of, the, presbyters, as, rulers, of, the, church, because, they, had, been, appointed, by, the, apostles, his, letter, which, is, one, of, the, oldest, extant, christian, documents, outside, the, new, testament, was, read, in, the, church, at, corinth, along, with, other, epistles, some, of, which, later, became, part, of, the, christian, canon, this, letter, is, considered, to, be, the, earliest, affirmation, of, the, principle, of, apostolic, succession, a, second, epistle, 2, clement, was, once, controversially, attributed, to, clement, although, recent, scholarship, suggests, it, to, be, a, homily, by, another, author, in, the, pseudo, clementine, writings, clement, is, the, intermediary, through, whom, the, apostles, teach, the, church, clement, is, recognized, as, a, saint, in, many, christian, churches, and, a, patron, saint, of, mariners, he, is, commemorated, on, 23, november, in, the, catholic, church, the, anglican, communion, and, the, lutheran, church, in, eastern, orthodox, christianity, his, feast, is, kept, on, 25, november, the, liber, pontificalis, presents, a, list, that, makes, linus, the, second, in, the, line, of, bishops, of, rome, with, peter, as, first, but, at, the, same, time, it, states, that, peter, ordained, two, bishops, linus, and, anacletus, for, the, priestly, service, of, the, community, devoting, himself, instead, to, prayer, and, preaching, and, that, it, was, to, clement, that, he, entrusted, the, church, as, a, whole, appointing, him, as, his, successor, tertullian, considered, clement, to, be, the, immediate, successor, of, peter, in, one, of, his, works, jerome, listed, clement, as, the, fourth, bishop, of, rome, after, peter, if, indeed, the, second, was, linus, and, the, third, anacletus, although, most, of, the, latins, think, that, clement, was, second, after, the, apostle, clement, is, put, after, linus, and, cletus, anacletus, in, the, earliest, c, 180, account, that, of, irenaeus, who, is, followed, by, eusebius, of, caesarea, early, succession, lists, name, clement, as, the, first, 636, second, or, third, successor, of, peter, however, the, meaning, of, his, inclusion, in, these, lists, has, been, very, controversial, some, believe, there, were, presbyter, bishops, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, but, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, a, monarchical, episcopacy, in, rome, at, such, an, early, date, there, is, also, however, no, evidence, of, a, change, occurring, in, ecclesiastical, organization, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 2nd, century, which, would, indicate, that, a, new, or, newly, monarchical, episcopacy, was, establishing, itself, a, tradition, that, began, in, the, 3rd, and, 4th, century, has, identified, him, as, the, clement, that, paul, mentioned, in, philippians, 4, 3, a, fellow, laborer, in, christ, while, in, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, customary, to, identify, him, as, a, freedman, of, titus, flavius, clemens, who, was, consul, with, his, cousin, the, emperor, domitian, this, identification, which, no, ancient, sources, suggest, afterwards, lost, support, the, 2nd, century, shepherd, of, hermas, mentions, a, clement, whose, office, it, was, to, communicate, with, other, churches, most, likely, this, is, a, reference, to, clement, i, a, large, congregation, existed, in, rome, c, 58, when, paul, wrote, his, epistle, to, the, romans, paul, arrived, in, rome, c, 60, acts, paul, and, peter, were, said, to, have, been, martyred, there, nero, persecuted, roman, christians, after, rome, burned, in, 64, and, the, congregation, may, have, suffered, further, persecution, under, domitian, 81, 96, clement, was, the, first, of, early, rome, s, most, notable, bishops, the, liber, pontificalis, which, documents, the, reigns, of, popes, states, that, clement, had, known, peter, clement, is, known, for, his, epistle, to, the, church, in, corinth, c, 96, in, which, he, asserts, the, apostolic, authority, of, the, bishops, presbyters, as, rulers, of, the, church, the, epistle, mentions, episkopoi, overseers, bishops, or, presbyteroi, elders, presbyters, as, the, upper, class, of, minister, served, by, the, deacons, but, since, it, does, not, mention, himself, it, gives, no, indication, of, the, title, or, titles, used, for, clement, in, rome, according, to, apocryphal, acta, dating, to, the, 4th, century, at, earliest, clement, was, banished, from, rome, to, the, chersonesus, during, the, reign, of, the, emperor, trajan, and, was, set, to, work, in, a, stone, quarry, finding, on, his, arrival, that, the, prisoners, were, suffering, from, lack, of, water, he, knelt, down, in, prayer, looking, up, he, saw, a, lamb, on, a, hill, went, to, where, the, lamb, had, stood, and, struck, the, ground, with, his, pickaxe, releasing, a, gushing, stream, of, clear, water, this, miracle, resulted, in, the, conversion, of, large, numbers, of, the, local, pagans, and, his, fellow, prisoners, to, christianity, as, punishment, clement, was, martyred, by, being, tied, to, an, anchor, and, thrown, from, a, boat, into, the, black, sea, the, legend, recounts, that, every, year, a, miraculous, ebbing, of, the, sea, revealed, a, divinely, built, shrine, containing, his, bones, however, the, oldest, sources, on, clement, s, life, eusebius, and, jerome, note, nothing, of, his, martyrdom, 639, the, inkerman, cave, monastery, marks, the, supposed, place, of, clement, s, burial, in, crimea, a, year, or, two, before, his, own, death, in, 869, cyril, brought, to, rome, what, he, believed, to, be, the, relics, of, clement, bones, he, found, in, crimea, buried, with, an, anchor, on, dry, land, they, are, now, enshrined, in, the, basilica, di, san, clemente, but, there, are, also, other, traditions, about, an, ancient, veneration, of, the, relics, in, chersonesus, and, the, translation, of, the, head, to, kyiv, other, relics, of, clement, including, his, head, are, claimed, by, the, kyiv, monastery, of, the, caves, in, ukraine, the, liber, pontificalis, states, that, clement, wrote, two, letters, though, the, second, letter, 2, clement, is, no, longer, ascribed, to, him, by, many, modern, scholars, clement, s, only, extant, uncontested, text, is, a, letter, to, the, christian, congregation, in, corinth, often, called, the, first, epistle, of, clement, or, 1, clement, the, history, of, 1, clement, clearly, and, continuously, shows, clement, as, the, author, of, this, letter, it, is, considered, the, earliest, authentic, christian, document, outside, the, new, testament, clement, writes, to, the, troubled, congregation, in, corinth, where, certain, presbyters, or, bishops, have, been, deposed, the, class, of, clergy, above, that, of, deacons, is, argued, by, certain, historians, to, be, designated, indifferently, by, the, two, terms, clement, calls, for, repentance, and, reinstatement, of, those, who, have, been, deposed, in, line, with, maintenance, of, order, and, obedience, to, church, authority, since, the, apostles, established, the, ministry, of, bishops, and, deacons, he, mentions, offering, the, gifts, as, one, of, the, functions, of, the, higher, class, of, clergy, the, epistle, offers, valuable, insight, into, church, ministry, at, that, time, and, into, the, history, of, the, roman, church, it, was, highly, regarded, and, was, read, in, church, at, corinth, along, with, the, scriptures, c, 170, we, should, be, obedient, unto, god, rather, than, follow, those, who, in, arrogance, and, unruliness, have, set, themselves, up, as, leaders, in, abominable, jealousy, for, christ, is, with, them, that, are, lowly, of, mind, not, with, them, that, exalt, themselves, over, the, flock, do, we, then, think, it, to, be, a, great, and, marvelous, thing, if, the, creator, of, the, universe, shall, bring, about, the, resurrection, of, them, that, have, served, him, with, holiness, in, the, assurance, of, a, good, faith, seeing, that, he, showeth, to, us, even, by, a, bird, the, magnificence, of, his, promise, in, the, epistle, it, is, argued, by, some, that, clement, uses, the, terms, bishop, and, presbyter, interchangeably, for, the, higher, order, of, ministers, above, deacons, in, some, congregations, particularly, in, egypt, the, distinction, between, bishops, and, presbyters, seems, to, have, become, established, only, later, but, by, the, middle, of, the, second, century, all, the, leading, christian, centres, had, bishops, scholars, such, as, bart, ehrman, treat, as, significant, the, fact, that, of, the, seven, letters, written, by, ignatius, of, antioch, to, seven, christian, churches, shortly, after, the, time, of, clement, the, only, one, that, does, not, present, the, church, as, headed, by, a, single, bishop, is, that, addressed, to, the, church, in, rome, although, this, letter, did, not, refer, to, a, collective, priesthood, either, clement, s, letter, also, contains, historical, references, it, mentions, persecutions, of, christians, records, the, martyrdom, of, the, apostle, peter, and, suggests, that, the, apostle, paul, traveled, to, spain, clement, s, view, on, justification, has, had, much, scholarly, discussion, as, he, is, sometimes, argued, to, have, believed, sola, fide, though, others, believe, him, as, having, synergist, views, debate, exists, because, clement, directly, stated, that, we, are, not, justified, by, ourselves, but, by, faith, however, in, other, places, of, the, letter, he, stresses, judgement, on, sin, the, protestant, scholar, tom, schreiner, argued, that, clement, of, rome, believed, in, a, grace, oriented, justification, by, faith, which, will, cause, the, believer, to, do, works, as, a, result, philip, schaff, also, said, that, clement, probably, taught, a, faith, alone, doctrine, while, catholic, encyclopedia, wrote, that, clement, believed, works, to, be, part, of, justification, rudolf, knopf, and, rudolf, bultmann, also, believed, that, clement, believed, in, synergism, and, that, the, believer, needs, to, cooperate, with, the, grace, of, god, to, be, saved, rudolf, knopf, in, his, commentary, on, the, letter, of, clement, to, the, corinthians, stated, that, pre, christian, sins, are, wiped, out, by, baptism, for, those, sins, that, follow, a, person, must, have, faith, in, divine, mercy, and, at, the, same, time, that, person, must, exhibit, his, or, her, own, good, deeds, apart, from, which, the, person, cannot, be, saved, david, downs, argued, against, the, view, that, clement, of, rome, holds, synergist, views, he, argued, that, clement, did, not, write, a, letter, about, deep, soteriology, but, instead, to, provide, moral, guidance, to, the, corinthians, david, downs, stated, according, to, the, soteriological, economy, of, clement, everything, rests, on, the, goodness, mercy, and, election, of, the, creator, which, have, befitted, the, chosen, portion, through, jesus, thomas, schreiner, argued, that, clement, taught, that, faith, was, enough, to, be, saved, because, of, 1, clement, 32, 4, where, he, stated, and, so, we, having, been, called, through, his, will, in, christ, jesus, are, not, justified, through, ourselves, or, through, our, own, wisdom, or, understanding, or, piety, or, works, which, we, wrought, in, holiness, of, heart, but, through, faith, whereby, the, almighty, god, justified, all, men, that, have, been, from, the, beginning, to, whom, be, the, glory, for, ever, and, ever, amen, 1, clement, 32, 4, the, epistle, has, been, cited, as, the, first, work, to, establish, roman, primacy, because, he, wrote, to, settle, a, problem, in, the, church, but, most, scholars, see, the, epistle, as, more, fraternal, than, authoritative, and, orthodox, scholar, john, meyendorff, sees, it, as, connected, with, the, roman, church, s, awareness, of, its, priority, rather, than, primacy, among, local, churches, it, has, also, been, argued, by, dave, armstrong, that, clement, supported, papal, infallibility, in, letter, to, the, corinthians, 1, 63, because, of, him, speaking, of, the, corinthians, to, being, obedient, to, the, things, he, has, written, through, the, holy, spirit, in, order, to, correct, and, root, out, the, wicked, passion, of, jealousy, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, epistle, may, contain, early, evidence, for, belief, in, universal, salvation, according, to, catholic, encyclopedia, the, letter, of, clement, has, trinitarian, theology, and, christ, is, frequently, called, as, the, high, priest, by, him, the, second, epistle, of, clement, is, a, homily, or, sermon, likely, written, in, corinth, or, rome, but, not, by, clement, early, christian, congregations, often, shared, homilies, to, be, read, the, homily, describes, christian, character, and, repentance, it, is, possible, that, the, church, from, which, clement, sent, his, epistle, had, included, a, festal, homily, to, share, in, one, economical, post, thus, the, homily, became, known, as, the, second, epistle, of, clement, while, 2, clement, has, been, traditionally, ascribed, to, clement, most, scholars, believe, that, 2, clement, was, written, in, the, 2nd, century, based, on, the, doctrinal, themes, of, the, text, and, a, near, match, between, words, in, 2, clement, and, in, the, greek, gospel, of, the, egyptians, doubts, about, the, authorship, were, already, expressed, in, antiquity, by, eusebius, and, jerome, two, epistles, on, virginity, were, traditionally, attributed, to, clement, but, now, there, exists, almost, universal, consensus, that, clement, was, not, the, author, of, those, two, epistles, a, 9th, century, collection, of, church, legislation, known, as, the, false, decretals, which, was, once, attributed, to, isidore, of, seville, is, largely, composed, of, forgeries, all, of, what, it, presents, as, letters, of, pre, nicene, popes, beginning, with, clement, are, forgeries, as, are, some, of, the, documents, that, it, attributes, to, councils, and, more, than, forty, falsifications, are, found, in, the, decretals, that, it, gives, as, those, of, post, nicene, popes, from, sylvester, i, 314, 335, to, gregory, ii, 715, 731, the, false, decretals, were, part, of, a, series, of, falsifications, of, past, legislation, by, a, party, in, the, carolingian, empire, whose, principal, aim, was, to, free, the, church, and, the, bishops, from, interference, by, the, state, and, the, metropolitan, archbishops, respectively, clement, is, included, among, other, early, christian, popes, as, authors, of, the, pseudo, isidoran, or, false, decretals, a, 9th, century, forgery, these, decrees, and, letters, portray, even, the, early, popes, as, claiming, absolute, and, universal, authority, clement, is, the, earliest, pope, to, whom, a, pseudo, isidoran, text, is, attributed, clement, is, also, the, hero, of, an, early, christian, romance, or, novel, that, has, survived, in, at, least, two, different, versions, known, as, the, clementine, literature, where, he, is, identified, with, emperor, domitian, s, cousin, titus, flavius, clemens, clementine, literature, portrays, clement, as, the, apostles, means, of, disseminating, their, teachings, to,
