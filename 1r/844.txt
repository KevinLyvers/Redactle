vilfredo, federico, damaso, pareto, born, wilfried, fritz, pareto, 15, july, 1848, 19, august, 1923, was, an, italian, polymath, whose, areas, of, interest, included, sociology, civil, engineering, economics, political, science, and, philosophy, he, made, several, important, contributions, to, economics, particularly, in, the, study, of, income, distribution, and, in, the, analysis, of, individuals, choices, he, was, also, responsible, for, popularising, the, use, of, the, term, elite, in, social, analysis, he, introduced, the, concept, of, pareto, efficiency, and, helped, develop, the, field, of, microeconomics, he, was, also, the, first, to, claim, that, income, follows, a, pareto, distribution, which, is, a, power, law, probability, distribution, the, pareto, principle, was, named, after, him, and, it, was, built, on, his, observations, that, 80, of, the, wealth, in, italy, belonged, to, about, 20, of, the, population, he, also, contributed, to, the, fields, of, sociology, and, mathematics, pareto, was, born, of, an, exiled, noble, genoese, family, on, 15, july, 1848, in, paris, the, centre, of, the, popular, revolutions, of, that, year, his, father, raffaele, pareto, 1812, 1882, was, an, italian, civil, engineer, and, ligurian, marquis, who, had, left, italy, much, as, giuseppe, mazzini, and, other, italian, nationalists, had, his, mother, marie, metenier, was, a, french, woman, enthusiastic, about, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, the, german, states, his, parents, named, him, wilfried, fritz, which, became, vilfredo, federico, upon, his, family, s, move, back, to, italy, in, 1858, in, his, childhood, pareto, lived, in, a, middle, class, environment, receiving, a, high, standard, of, education, attending, the, newly, created, istituto, tecnico, leardi, where, ferdinando, pio, rosellini, was, his, mathematics, professor, in, 1869, he, earned, a, doctorate, in, engineering, from, what, is, now, the, polytechnic, university, of, turin, then, the, technical, school, for, engineers, with, a, dissertation, entitled, the, fundamental, principles, of, equilibrium, in, solid, bodies, his, later, interest, in, equilibrium, analysis, in, economics, and, sociology, can, be, traced, back, to, this, dissertation, pareto, was, among, the, contributors, to, the, rome, based, magazine, la, ronda, between, 1919, and, 1922, for, some, years, after, graduation, he, worked, as, a, civil, engineer, first, for, the, state, owned, italian, railway, company, and, later, in, private, industry, he, was, manager, of, the, iron, works, of, san, giovanni, valdarno, and, later, general, manager, of, italian, iron, works, he, did, not, begin, serious, work, in, economics, until, his, mid, forties, he, started, his, career, as, a, fiery, advocate, of, classical, liberalism, besetting, the, most, ardent, british, liberals, with, his, attacks, on, any, form, of, government, intervention, in, the, free, market, in, 1886, he, became, a, lecturer, on, economics, and, management, at, the, university, of, florence, his, stay, in, florence, was, marked, by, political, activity, much, of, it, fueled, by, his, own, frustrations, with, government, regulators, in, 1889, after, the, death, of, his, parents, pareto, changed, his, lifestyle, quitting, his, job, and, marrying, a, russian, woman, alessandrina, bakunina, in, 1893, he, succeeded, l, on, walras, to, the, chair, of, political, economy, at, the, university, of, lausanne, in, switzerland, where, he, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, published, there, in, 1896, 1897, a, textbook, containing, the, pareto, distribution, of, how, wealth, is, distributed, which, he, believed, was, a, constant, through, any, human, society, in, any, age, or, country, in, 1906, he, made, the, famous, observation, that, twenty, per, cent, of, the, population, owned, eighty, per, cent, of, the, property, in, italy, later, generalised, by, joseph, m, juran, into, the, pareto, principle, also, termed, the, 80, 20, rule, pareto, maintained, cordial, personal, relationships, with, individual, socialists, but, he, always, thought, their, economic, ideas, were, severely, flawed, he, later, became, suspicious, of, their, motives, and, denounced, socialist, leaders, as, an, aristocracy, of, brigands, who, threatened, to, despoil, the, country, and, criticized, the, government, of, the, italian, statesman, giovanni, giolitti, for, not, taking, a, tougher, stance, against, worker, strikes, growing, unrest, among, labour, in, the, kingdom, of, italy, led, him, to, the, anti, socialist, and, anti, democratic, camp, his, attitude, towards, italian, fascism, in, his, last, years, is, a, matter, of, controversy, pareto, s, relationship, with, scientific, sociology, in, the, age, of, the, foundation, is, grafted, in, a, paradigmatic, way, at, the, moment, in, which, he, starting, from, the, political, economy, criticizes, positivism, as, a, totalizing, and, metaphysical, system, devoid, of, a, rigorous, logical, experimental, method, in, this, sense, we, can, read, the, fate, of, the, paretian, production, within, a, history, of, the, social, sciences, that, continues, to, show, its, peculiarity, and, interest, for, its, contributions, in, the, 21st, century, the, story, of, pareto, is, also, part, of, the, multidisciplinary, research, of, a, scientific, model, that, privileges, sociology, as, a, critique, of, cumulative, models, of, knowledge, as, well, as, a, discipline, tending, to, the, affirmation, of, relational, models, of, science, in, 1889, pareto, married, alessandrina, bakunina, a, russian, woman, she, left, him, in, 1902, for, a, young, servant, twenty, years, later, in, 1923, he, married, jeanne, regis, a, french, woman, just, before, his, death, in, geneva, switzerland, on, 19, august, 1923, pareto, s, later, years, were, spent, in, collecting, the, material, for, his, best, known, work, trattato, di, sociologia, generale, 1916, the, mind, and, society, published, in, 1935, his, final, work, was, compendio, di, sociologia, generale, 1920, in, his, trattato, di, sociologia, generale, 1916, rev, french, trans, 1917, published, in, english, by, harcourt, brace, in, a, four, volume, edition, edited, by, arthur, livingston, under, the, title, the, mind, and, society, 1935, pareto, developed, the, notion, of, the, circulation, of, elites, the, first, social, cycle, theory, in, sociology, he, is, famous, for, saying, history, is, a, graveyard, of, aristocracies, pareto, seems, to, have, turned, to, sociology, for, an, understanding, of, why, his, abstract, mathematical, economic, theories, did, not, work, out, in, practice, in, the, belief, that, unforeseen, or, uncontrollable, social, factors, intervened, his, sociology, holds, that, much, social, action, is, nonlogical, and, that, much, personal, action, is, designed, to, give, spurious, logicality, to, non, rational, actions, we, are, driven, he, taught, by, certain, residues, and, by, derivations, from, these, residues, the, more, important, of, these, have, to, do, with, conservatism, and, risk, taking, and, human, history, is, the, story, of, the, alternate, dominance, of, these, sentiments, in, the, ruling, elite, which, comes, into, power, strong, in, conservatism, but, gradually, changes, over, to, the, philosophy, of, the, foxes, or, speculators, a, catastrophe, results, with, a, return, to, conservatism, the, lion, mentality, follows, this, cycle, might, be, broken, by, the, use, of, force, says, pareto, but, the, elite, becomes, weak, and, humanitarian, and, shrinks, from, violence, among, those, who, introduced, pareto, s, sociology, to, the, united, states, were, george, homans, and, lawrence, j, henderson, at, harvard, and, paretian, ideas, gained, considerable, influence, especially, on, harvard, sociologist, talcott, parsons, who, developed, a, systems, approach, to, society, and, economics, that, argues, the, status, quo, is, usually, functional, the, american, historian, bernard, devoto, played, an, important, role, in, introducing, pareto, s, ideas, to, these, cambridge, intellectuals, and, other, americans, in, the, 1930s, wallace, stegner, in, his, biography, of, devoto, recounts, these, developments, and, says, this, about, the, often, misunderstood, distinction, between, residues, and, derivations, basic, to, pareto, s, method, is, the, analysis, of, society, through, its, non, rational, residues, which, are, persistent, and, unquestioned, social, habits, beliefs, and, assumptions, and, its, derivations, which, are, the, explanations, justifications, and, rationalizations, we, make, of, them, one, of, the, commonest, errors, of, social, thinkers, is, to, assume, rationality, and, logic, in, social, attitudes, and, structures, another, is, to, confuse, residues, and, derivations, renato, cirillo, wrote, that, vilfredo, pareto, had, frequently, been, considered, a, predecessor, of, fascism, as, a, result, of, his, support, for, the, movement, when, it, began, however, cirillo, disagreed, with, this, interpretation, suggesting, that, pareto, was, critical, of, fascism, in, his, private, letters, pareto, argued, that, democracy, was, an, illusion, and, that, a, ruling, class, always, emerged, and, enriched, itself, for, him, the, key, question, was, how, actively, the, rulers, ruled, for, this, reason, he, called, for, a, drastic, reduction, of, the, state, and, welcomed, benito, mussolini, s, rule, as, a, transition, to, this, minimal, state, so, as, to, liberate, the, pure, economic, forces, when, he, was, still, a, young, student, the, future, leader, of, italian, fascism, benito, mussolini, attended, some, of, pareto, s, lectures, at, the, university, of, lausanne, in, 1904, it, has, been, argued, that, mussolini, s, move, away, from, socialism, towards, a, form, of, elitism, may, be, attributed, to, pareto, s, ideas, franz, borkenau, a, biographer, argued, that, mussolini, followed, pareto, s, policy, ideas, during, the, beginning, of, his, tenure, as, prime, minister, 18, karl, popper, dubbed, pareto, the, theoretician, of, totalitarianism, but, according, to, renato, cirillo, there, is, no, evidence, in, popper, s, published, work, that, he, read, pareto, in, any, detail, before, repeating, what, was, then, a, common, but, dubious, judgement, in, anti, fascist, circles, pareto, theory, of, maximum, economics, pareto, turned, his, interest, to, economic, matters, and, he, became, an, advocate, of, free, trade, finding, himself, in, conflict, with, the, italian, government, his, writings, reflected, the, ideas, of, l, on, walras, that, economics, is, essentially, a, mathematical, science, pareto, was, a, leader, of, the, lausanne, school, and, represents, the, second, generation, of, the, neoclassical, revolution, his, tastes, and, obstacles, approach, to, general, equilibrium, theory, was, resurrected, during, the, great, paretian, revival, of, the, 1930s, and, has, influenced, theoretical, economics, since, in, his, manual, of, political, economy, 1906, the, focus, is, on, equilibrium, in, terms, of, solutions, to, individual, problems, of, objectives, and, constraints, he, used, the, indifference, curve, of, edgeworth, 1881, extensively, for, the, theory, of, the, consumer, and, another, great, novelty, in, his, theory, of, the, producer, he, gave, the, first, presentation, of, the, trade, off, box, now, known, as, the, edgeworth, bowley, box, pareto, was, the, first, to, realize, that, cardinal, utility, could, be, dispensed, with, and, economic, equilibrium, thought, of, in, terms, of, ordinal, utility, that, is, it, was, not, necessary, to, know, how, much, a, person, valued, this, or, that, only, that, he, preferred, x, of, this, to, y, of, that, utility, was, a, preference, ordering, with, this, pareto, not, only, inaugurated, modern, microeconomics, but, he, also, demolished, the, alliance, of, economics, and, utilitarian, philosophy, which, calls, for, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, pareto, said, good, cannot, be, measured, he, replaced, it, with, the, notion, of, pareto, optimality, the, idea, that, a, system, is, enjoying, maximum, economic, satisfaction, when, no, one, can, be, made, better, off, without, making, someone, else, worse, off, pareto, optimality, is, widely, used, in, welfare, economics, and, game, theory, a, standard, theorem, is, that, a, perfectly, competitive, market, creates, distributions, of, wealth, that, are, pareto, optimal, some, economic, concepts, in, current, use, are, based, on, his, work, he, argued, that, in, all, countries, and, times, the, distribution, of, income, and, wealth, is, highly, skewed, with, a, few, holding, most, of, the, wealth, he, argued, that, all, observed, societies, follow, a, regular, logarithmic, pattern, where, n, is, the, number, of, people, with, wealth, higher, than, x, and, a, and, m, are, constants, over, the, years, pareto, s, law, has, proved, remarkably, close, to, observed, data
