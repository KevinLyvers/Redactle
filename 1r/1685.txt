post, docs, linus, carl, pauling, frs, p, l, paw, ling, february, 28, 1901, august, 19, 1994, was, an, american, chemist, biochemist, chemical, engineer, peace, activist, author, and, educator, he, published, more, than, 1, 200, papers, and, books, of, which, about, 850, dealt, with, scientific, topics, new, scientist, called, him, one, of, the, 20, greatest, scientists, of, all, time, for, his, scientific, work, pauling, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1954, for, his, peace, activism, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1962, he, is, one, of, five, people, to, have, won, more, than, one, nobel, prize, the, others, being, marie, curie, john, bardeen, frederick, sanger, and, karl, barry, sharpless, of, these, he, is, the, only, person, to, have, been, awarded, two, unshared, nobel, prizes, and, one, of, two, people, to, be, awarded, nobel, prizes, in, different, fields, the, other, being, marie, curie, pauling, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, fields, of, quantum, chemistry, and, molecular, biology, his, contributions, to, the, theory, of, the, chemical, bond, include, the, concept, of, orbital, hybridisation, and, the, first, accurate, scale, of, electronegativities, of, the, elements, pauling, also, worked, on, the, structures, of, biological, molecules, and, showed, the, importance, of, the, alpha, helix, and, beta, sheet, in, protein, secondary, structure, pauling, s, approach, combined, methods, and, results, from, x, ray, crystallography, molecular, model, building, and, quantum, chemistry, his, discoveries, inspired, the, work, of, rosalind, franklin, james, watson, francis, crick, and, maurice, wilkins, on, the, structure, of, dna, which, in, turn, made, it, possible, for, geneticists, to, crack, the, dna, code, of, all, organisms, in, his, later, years, he, promoted, nuclear, disarmament, as, well, as, orthomolecular, medicine, megavitamin, therapy, and, dietary, supplements, especially, ascorbic, acid, commonly, known, as, vitamin, c, none, of, his, ideas, concerning, the, medical, usefulness, of, large, doses, of, vitamins, have, gained, much, acceptance, in, the, mainstream, scientific, community, he, was, married, to, the, american, human, rights, activist, ava, helen, pauling, linus, carl, pauling, was, born, on, february, 28, 1901, in, portland, oregon, the, firstborn, child, of, herman, henry, william, pauling, 1876, 1910, and, lucy, isabelle, belle, darling, 1881, 1926, 22, he, was, named, linus, carl, in, honor, of, lucy, s, father, linus, and, herman, s, father, carl, 8, his, ancestry, included, german, and, english, in, 1902, after, his, sister, pauline, was, born, pauling, s, parents, decided, to, move, out, of, portland, to, find, more, affordable, and, spacious, living, quarters, than, their, one, room, apartment, 4, lucy, stayed, with, her, husband, s, parents, in, oswego, until, herman, brought, the, family, to, salem, where, he, worked, briefly, as, a, traveling, salesman, for, the, skidmore, drug, company, within, a, year, of, lucile, s, birth, in, 1904, herman, pauling, moved, his, family, to, oswego, oregon, where, he, opened, his, own, drugstore, 4, he, moved, his, family, to, condon, oregon, in, 1905, 5, by, 1906, herman, pauling, was, suffering, from, recurrent, abdominal, pain, he, died, of, a, perforated, ulcer, on, june, 11, 1910, leaving, lucy, to, care, for, linus, lucile, and, pauline, 9, pauling, attributes, his, interest, in, becoming, a, chemist, to, being, amazed, by, experiments, conducted, by, a, friend, lloyd, a, jeffress, who, had, a, small, chemistry, lab, kit, 17, he, later, wrote, i, was, simply, entranced, by, chemical, phenomena, by, the, reactions, in, which, substances, often, with, strikingly, different, properties, appear, and, i, hoped, to, learn, more, and, more, about, this, aspect, of, the, world, in, high, school, pauling, conducted, chemistry, experiments, by, scavenging, equipment, and, material, from, an, abandoned, steel, plant, with, an, older, friend, lloyd, simon, pauling, set, up, palmon, laboratories, in, simon, s, basement, they, approached, local, dairies, offering, to, perform, butterfat, samplings, at, cheap, prices, but, dairymen, were, wary, of, trusting, two, boys, with, the, task, and, the, business, ended, in, failure, 21, at, age, 15, the, high, school, senior, had, enough, credits, to, enter, oregon, state, university, osu, known, then, as, oregon, agricultural, college, 22, lacking, two, american, history, courses, required, for, his, high, school, diploma, pauling, asked, the, school, principal, if, he, could, take, the, courses, concurrently, during, the, spring, semester, denied, he, left, washington, high, school, in, june, without, a, diploma, 48, the, school, awarded, him, an, honorary, diploma, 45, years, later, after, he, was, awarded, two, nobel, prizes, pauling, held, a, number, of, jobs, to, earn, money, for, his, future, college, expenses, including, working, part, time, at, a, grocery, store, for, us, 8, per, week, equivalent, to, us, 220, in, 2023, his, mother, arranged, an, interview, with, the, owner, of, a, number, of, manufacturing, plants, in, portland, mr, schwietzerhoff, who, hired, him, as, an, apprentice, machinist, at, a, salary, of, us, 40, per, month, equivalent, to, us, 1, 120, in, 2023, this, was, soon, raised, to, us, 50, per, month, 23, pauling, also, set, up, a, photography, laboratory, with, two, friends, 24, in, september, 1917, pauling, was, finally, admitted, by, oregon, state, university, he, immediately, resigned, from, the, machinist, s, job, and, informed, his, mother, who, saw, no, point, in, a, university, education, of, his, plans, 25, in, his, first, semester, pauling, registered, for, two, courses, in, chemistry, two, in, mathematics, mechanical, drawing, introduction, to, mining, and, use, of, explosives, modern, english, prose, gymnastics, and, military, drill, 26, his, roommate, was, childhood, pal, and, lifelong, best, friend, lloyd, jeffress, he, was, active, in, campus, life, and, founded, the, school, s, chapter, of, the, delta, upsilon, fraternity, after, his, second, year, he, planned, to, take, a, job, in, portland, to, help, support, his, mother, the, college, offered, him, a, position, teaching, quantitative, analysis, a, course, he, had, just, finished, taking, himself, he, worked, forty, hours, a, week, in, the, laboratory, and, classroom, and, earned, us, 100, a, month, equivalent, to, us, 1, 500, in, 2023, enabling, him, to, continue, his, studies, 29, in, his, last, two, years, at, school, pauling, became, aware, of, the, work, of, gilbert, n, lewis, and, irving, langmuir, on, the, electronic, structure, of, atoms, and, their, bonding, to, form, molecules, 29, he, decided, to, focus, his, research, on, how, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, substances, are, related, to, the, structure, of, the, atoms, of, which, they, are, composed, becoming, one, of, the, founders, of, the, new, science, of, quantum, chemistry, engineering, professor, samuel, graf, selected, pauling, to, be, his, teaching, assistant, in, a, mechanics, and, materials, course, 29, during, the, winter, of, his, senior, year, pauling, taught, a, chemistry, course, for, home, economics, majors, it, was, in, one, of, these, classes, that, pauling, met, his, future, wife, ava, helen, miller, 31, 41, in, 1922, pauling, graduated, with, a, degree, in, chemical, engineering, he, went, on, to, graduate, school, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, caltech, in, pasadena, california, under, the, guidance, of, roscoe, dickinson, and, richard, tolman, his, graduate, research, involved, the, use, of, x, ray, diffraction, to, determine, the, structure, of, crystals, he, published, seven, papers, on, the, crystal, structure, of, minerals, while, he, was, at, caltech, he, received, his, phd, in, physical, chemistry, and, mathematical, physics, summa, cum, laude, in, 1925, in, 1926, pauling, was, awarded, a, guggenheim, fellowship, to, travel, to, europe, to, study, under, german, physicist, arnold, sommerfeld, in, munich, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, in, copenhagen, and, austrian, physicist, erwin, schr, dinger, in, z, rich, all, three, were, experts, in, the, new, field, of, quantum, mechanics, and, other, branches, of, physics, pauling, became, interested, in, how, quantum, mechanics, might, be, applied, in, his, chosen, field, of, interest, the, electronic, structure, of, atoms, and, molecules, in, z, rich, pauling, was, also, exposed, to, one, of, the, first, quantum, mechanical, analyses, of, bonding, in, the, hydrogen, molecule, done, by, walter, heitler, and, fritz, london, pauling, devoted, the, two, years, of, his, european, trip, to, this, work, and, decided, to, make, it, the, focus, of, his, future, research, he, became, one, of, the, first, scientists, in, the, field, of, quantum, chemistry, and, a, pioneer, in, the, application, of, quantum, theory, to, the, structure, of, molecules, in, 1927, pauling, took, a, new, position, as, an, assistant, professor, at, caltech, in, theoretical, chemistry, he, launched, his, faculty, career, with, a, very, productive, five, years, continuing, with, his, x, ray, crystal, studies, and, also, performing, quantum, mechanical, calculations, on, atoms, and, molecules, he, published, approximately, fifty, papers, in, those, five, years, and, created, the, five, rules, now, known, as, pauling, s, rules, by, 1929, he, was, promoted, to, associate, professor, and, by, 1930, to, full, professor, in, 1931, the, american, chemical, society, awarded, pauling, the, langmuir, prize, for, the, most, significant, work, in, pure, science, by, a, person, 30, years, of, age, or, younger, the, following, year, pauling, published, what, he, regarded, as, his, most, important, paper, in, which, he, first, laid, out, the, concept, of, hybridization, of, atomic, orbitals, and, analyzed, the, tetravalency, of, the, carbon, atom, at, caltech, pauling, struck, up, a, close, friendship, with, theoretical, physicist, robert, oppenheimer, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, who, spent, part, of, his, research, and, teaching, schedule, as, a, visitor, at, caltech, each, year, pauling, was, also, affiliated, with, berkeley, serving, as, a, visiting, lecturer, in, physics, and, chemistry, from, 1929, to, 1934, oppenheimer, even, gave, pauling, a, stunning, personal, collection, of, minerals, the, two, men, planned, to, mount, a, joint, attack, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, apparently, oppenheimer, would, supply, the, mathematics, and, pauling, would, interpret, the, results, their, relationship, soured, when, oppenheimer, tried, to, pursue, pauling, s, wife, ava, helen, when, pauling, was, at, work, oppenheimer, came, to, their, home, and, blurted, out, an, invitation, to, ava, helen, to, join, him, on, a, tryst, in, mexico, she, flatly, refused, and, reported, the, incident, to, pauling, he, immediately, cut, off, his, relationship, with, oppenheimer, 152, in, the, summer, of, 1930, pauling, made, another, european, trip, during, which, he, learned, about, gas, phase, electron, diffraction, from, herman, francis, mark, after, returning, he, built, an, electron, diffraction, instrument, at, caltech, with, a, student, of, his, lawrence, olin, brockway, and, used, it, to, study, the, molecular, structure, of, a, large, number, of, chemical, substances, pauling, introduced, the, concept, of, electronegativity, in, 1932, using, the, various, properties, of, molecules, such, as, the, energy, required, to, break, bonds, and, the, dipole, moments, of, molecules, he, established, a, scale, and, an, associated, numerical, value, for, most, of, the, elements, the, pauling, electronegativity, scale, which, is, useful, in, predicting, the, nature, of, bonds, between, atoms, in, molecules, in, 1936, pauling, was, promoted, to, chairman, of, the, division, of, chemistry, and, chemical, engineering, at, caltech, and, to, the, position, of, director, of, the, gates, and, crellin, laboratories, of, chemistry, he, would, hold, both, positions, until, 1958, pauling, also, spent, a, year, in, 1948, at, the, university, of, oxford, as, george, eastman, visiting, professor, and, fellow, of, balliol, in, the, late, 1920s, pauling, began, publishing, papers, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, between, 1937, and, 1938, he, took, a, position, as, george, fischer, baker, non, resident, lecturer, in, chemistry, at, cornell, university, while, at, cornell, he, delivered, a, series, of, nineteen, lectures, and, completed, the, bulk, of, his, famous, textbook, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, preface, it, is, based, primarily, on, his, work, in, this, area, that, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1954, for, his, research, into, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, and, its, application, to, the, elucidation, of, the, structure, of, complex, substances, pauling, s, book, has, been, considered, chemistry, s, most, influential, book, of, this, century, and, its, effective, bible, in, the, 30, years, after, its, first, edition, was, published, in, 1939, the, book, was, cited, more, than, 16, 000, times, even, today, many, modern, scientific, papers, and, articles, in, important, journals, cite, this, work, more, than, seventy, years, after, the, first, publication, part, of, pauling, s, work, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, led, to, his, introduction, of, the, concept, of, orbital, hybridization, while, it, is, normal, to, think, of, the, electrons, in, an, atom, as, being, described, by, orbitals, of, types, such, as, s, and, p, it, turns, out, that, in, describing, the, bonding, in, molecules, it, is, better, to, construct, functions, that, partake, of, some, of, the, properties, of, each, thus, the, one, 2s, and, three, 2p, orbitals, in, a, carbon, atom, can, be, mathematically, mixed, or, combined, to, make, four, equivalent, orbitals, called, sp, 3, hybrid, orbitals, which, would, be, the, appropriate, orbitals, to, describe, carbon, compounds, such, as, methane, or, the, 2s, orbital, may, be, combined, with, two, of, the, 2p, orbitals, to, make, three, equivalent, orbitals, called, sp, 2, hybrid, orbitals, with, the, remaining, 2p, orbital, unhybridized, which, would, be, the, appropriate, orbitals, to, describe, certain, unsaturated, carbon, compounds, such, as, ethylene, 111, 120, other, hybridization, schemes, are, also, found, in, other, types, of, molecules, another, area, which, he, explored, was, the, relationship, between, ionic, bonding, where, electrons, are, transferred, between, atoms, and, covalent, bonding, where, electrons, are, shared, between, atoms, on, an, equal, basis, pauling, showed, that, these, were, merely, extremes, and, that, for, most, actual, cases, of, bonding, the, quantum, mechanical, wave, function, for, a, polar, molecule, ab, is, a, combination, of, wave, functions, for, covalent, and, ionic, molecules, 66, here, pauling, s, electronegativity, concept, is, particularly, useful, the, electronegativity, difference, between, a, pair, of, atoms, will, be, the, surest, predictor, of, the, degree, of, ionicity, of, the, bond, the, third, of, the, topics, that, pauling, attacked, under, the, overall, heading, of, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, was, the, accounting, of, the, structure, of, aromatic, hydrocarbons, particularly, the, prototype, benzene, the, best, description, of, benzene, had, been, made, by, the, german, chemist, friedrich, kekul, he, had, treated, it, as, a, rapid, interconversion, between, two, structures, each, with, alternating, single, and, double, bonds, but, with, the, double, bonds, of, one, structure, in, the, locations, where, the, single, bonds, were, in, the, other, pauling, showed, that, a, proper, description, based, on, quantum, mechanics, was, an, intermediate, structure, which, was, a, blend, of, each, the, structure, was, a, superposition, of, structures, rather, than, a, rapid, interconversion, between, them, the, name, resonance, was, later, applied, to, this, phenomenon, in, a, sense, this, phenomenon, resembles, those, of, hybridization, and, also, polar, bonding, both, described, above, because, all, three, phenomena, involve, combining, more, than, one, electronic, structure, to, achieve, an, intermediate, result, in, 1929, pauling, published, five, rules, which, help, to, predict, and, explain, crystal, structures, of, ionic, compounds, these, rules, concern, 1, the, ratio, of, cation, radius, to, anion, radius, 2, the, electrostatic, bond, strength, 3, the, sharing, of, polyhedron, corners, edges, and, faces, 4, crystals, containing, different, cations, and, 5, the, rule, of, parsimony, in, the, mid, 1930s, pauling, strongly, influenced, by, the, biologically, oriented, funding, priorities, of, the, rockefeller, foundation, s, warren, weaver, decided, to, strike, out, into, new, areas, of, interest, although, pauling, s, early, interest, had, focused, almost, exclusively, on, inorganic, molecular, structures, he, had, occasionally, thought, about, molecules, of, biological, importance, in, part, because, of, caltech, s, growing, strength, in, biology, pauling, interacted, with, such, great, biologists, as, thomas, hunt, morgan, theodosius, dobzhanski, calvin, bridges, and, alfred, sturtevant, his, early, work, in, this, area, included, studies, of, the, structure, of, hemoglobin, with, his, student, charles, d, coryell, he, demonstrated, that, the, hemoglobin, molecule, changes, structure, when, it, gains, or, loses, an, oxygen, molecule, as, a, result, of, this, observation, he, decided, to, conduct, a, more, thorough, study, of, protein, structure, in, general, he, returned, to, his, earlier, use, of, x, ray, diffraction, analysis, but, protein, structures, were, far, less, amenable, to, this, technique, than, the, crystalline, minerals, of, his, former, work, the, best, x, ray, pictures, of, proteins, in, the, 1930s, had, been, made, by, the, british, crystallographer, william, astbury, but, when, pauling, tried, in, 1937, to, account, for, astbury, s, observations, quantum, mechanically, he, could, not, it, took, eleven, years, for, pauling, to, explain, the, problem, his, mathematical, analysis, was, correct, but, astbury, s, pictures, were, taken, in, such, a, way, that, the, protein, molecules, were, tilted, from, their, expected, positions, pauling, had, formulated, a, model, for, the, structure, of, hemoglobin, in, which, atoms, were, arranged, in, a, helical, pattern, and, applied, this, idea, to, proteins, in, general, in, 1951, based, on, the, structures, of, amino, acids, and, peptides, and, the, planar, nature, of, the, peptide, bond, pauling, robert, corey, and, herman, branson, correctly, proposed, the, alpha, helix, and, beta, sheet, as, the, primary, structural, motifs, in, protein, secondary, structure, this, work, exemplified, pauling, s, ability, to, think, unconventionally, central, to, the, structure, was, the, unorthodox, assumption, that, one, turn, of, the, helix, may, well, contain, a, non, integer, number, of, amino, acid, residues, for, the, alpha, helix, it, is, 3, 7, amino, acid, residues, per, turn, pauling, then, proposed, that, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, was, a, triple, helix, his, model, contained, several, basic, mistakes, including, a, proposal, of, neutral, phosphate, groups, an, idea, that, conflicted, with, the, acidity, of, dna, sir, lawrence, bragg, had, been, disappointed, that, pauling, had, won, the, race, to, find, the, alpha, helix, structure, of, proteins, bragg, s, team, had, made, a, fundamental, error, in, making, their, models, of, protein, by, not, recognizing, the, planar, nature, of, the, peptide, bond, when, it, was, learned, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, that, pauling, was, working, on, molecular, models, of, the, structure, of, dna, james, watson, and, francis, crick, were, allowed, to, make, a, molecular, model, of, dna, they, later, benefited, from, unpublished, data, from, maurice, wilkins, and, rosalind, franklin, at, king, s, college, which, showed, evidence, for, a, helix, and, planar, base, stacking, along, the, helix, axis, early, in, 1953, watson, and, crick, proposed, a, correct, structure, for, the, dna, double, helix, pauling, later, cited, several, reasons, to, explain, how, he, had, been, misled, about, the, structure, of, dna, among, them, misleading, density, data, and, the, lack, of, high, quality, x, ray, diffraction, photographs, pauling, described, this, situation, as, the, biggest, disappointment, in, his, life, during, the, time, pauling, was, researching, the, problem, rosalind, franklin, in, england, was, creating, the, world, s, best, images, they, were, key, to, watson, s, and, crick, s, success, pauling, did, not, see, them, before, devising, his, mistaken, dna, structure, although, his, assistant, robert, corey, did, see, at, least, some, of, them, while, taking, pauling, s, place, at, a, summer, 1952, protein, conference, in, england, pauling, had, been, prevented, from, attending, because, his, passport, was, withheld, by, the, state, department, on, suspicion, that, he, had, communist, sympathies, this, led, to, the, legend, that, pauling, missed, the, structure, of, dna, because, of, the, politics, of, the, day, this, was, at, the, start, of, the, mccarthy, period, in, the, united, states, politics, did, not, play, a, critical, role, not, only, did, corey, see, the, images, at, the, time, but, pauling, himself, regained, his, passport, within, a, few, weeks, and, toured, english, laboratories, well, before, writing, his, dna, paper, he, had, ample, opportunity, to, visit, franklin, s, lab, and, see, her, work, but, chose, not, to, 414, 415, despite, these, times, pauling, chose, to, move, on, from, them, and, be, thankful, for, the, discoveries, that, he, had, already, found, pauling, also, studied, enzyme, reactions, and, was, among, the, first, to, point, out, that, enzymes, bring, about, reactions, by, stabilizing, the, transition, state, of, the, reaction, a, view, which, is, central, to, understanding, their, mechanism, of, action, he, was, also, among, the, first, scientists, to, postulate, that, the, binding, of, antibodies, to, antigens, would, be, due, to, a, complementarity, between, their, structures, along, the, same, lines, with, the, physicist, turned, biologist, max, delbr, ck, he, wrote, an, early, paper, arguing, that, dna, replication, was, likely, to, be, due, to, complementarity, rather, than, similarity, as, suggested, by, a, few, researchers, this, was, made, clear, in, the, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, that, watson, and, crick, discovered, in, november, 1949, pauling, harvey, itano, s, j, singer, and, ibert, wells, published, sickle, cell, anemia, a, molecular, disease, in, the, journal, science, it, was, the, first, proof, of, a, human, disease, being, caused, by, an, abnormal, protein, and, sickle, cell, anemia, became, the, first, disease, understood, at, the, molecular, level, it, was, not, however, the, first, demonstration, that, variant, forms, of, hemoglobin, could, be, distinguished, by, electrophoresis, which, had, been, shown, several, years, earlier, by, maud, menten, and, collaborators, using, electrophoresis, they, demonstrated, that, individuals, with, sickle, cell, disease, have, a, modified, form, of, hemoglobin, in, their, red, blood, cells, and, that, individuals, with, sickle, cell, trait, have, both, the, normal, and, abnormal, forms, of, hemoglobin, this, was, the, first, demonstration, causally, linking, an, abnormal, protein, to, a, disease, and, also, the, first, demonstration, that, mendelian, inheritance, determines, the, specific, physical, properties, of, proteins, not, simply, their, presence, or, absence, the, dawn, of, molecular, genetics, his, success, with, sickle, cell, anemia, led, pauling, to, speculate, that, a, number, of, other, diseases, including, mental, illnesses, such, as, schizophrenia, might, result, from, flawed, genetics, as, chairman, of, the, division, of, chemistry, and, chemical, engineering, and, director, of, the, gates, and, crellin, chemical, laboratories, he, encouraged, the, hiring, of, researchers, with, a, chemical, biomedical, approach, to, mental, illness, a, direction, not, always, popular, with, established, caltech, chemists, 2, in, 1951, pauling, gave, a, lecture, entitled, molecular, medicine, in, the, late, 1950s, he, studied, the, role, of, enzymes, in, brain, function, believing, that, mental, illness, may, be, partly, caused, by, enzyme, dysfunction, in, the, 1960s, as, part, of, his, interest, in, the, effects, of, nuclear, weapons, he, investigated, the, role, of, mutations, in, evolution, proposing, with, his, student, emile, zuckerkandl, the, molecular, evolutionary, clock, the, idea, that, mutations, in, proteins, and, dna, accumulate, at, a, constant, rate, over, time, on, september, 16, 1952, pauling, opened, a, new, research, notebook, with, the, words, i, have, decided, to, attack, the, problem, of, the, structure, of, nuclei, on, october, 15, 1965, pauling, published, his, close, packed, spheron, model, of, the, atomic, nucleus, in, two, well, respected, journals, science, and, the, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, for, nearly, three, decades, until, his, death, in, 1994, pauling, published, numerous, papers, on, his, spheron, cluster, model, the, basic, idea, behind, pauling, s, spheron, model, is, that, a, nucleus, can, be, viewed, as, a, set, of, clusters, of, nucleons, the, basic, nucleon, clusters, include, the, deuteron, helion, and, triton, even, even, nuclei, are, described, as, being, composed, of, clusters, of, alpha, particles, as, has, often, been, done, for, light, nuclei, pauling, attempted, to, derive, the, shell, structure, of, nuclei, from, pure, geometrical, considerations, related, to, platonic, solids, rather, than, starting, from, an, independent, particle, model, as, in, the, usual, shell, model, in, an, interview, given, in, 1990, pauling, commented, on, his, model, now, recently, i, have, been, trying, to, determine, detailed, structures, of, atomic, nuclei, by, analyzing, the, ground, state, and, excited, state, vibrational, bends, as, observed, experimentally, from, reading, the, physics, literature, physical, review, letters, and, other, journals, i, know, that, many, physicists, are, interested, in, atomic, nuclei, but, none, of, them, so, far, as, i, have, been, able, to, discover, has, been, attacking, the, problem, in, the, same, way, that, i, attack, it, so, i, just, move, along, at, my, own, speed, making, calculations, pauling, had, been, practically, apolitical, until, world, war, ii, at, the, beginning, of, the, manhattan, project, robert, oppenheimer, invited, him, to, be, in, charge, of, the, chemistry, division, of, the, project, he, declined, not, wanting, to, uproot, his, family, pauling, did, however, work, on, research, for, the, military, he, was, a, principal, investigator, on, 14, osrd, contracts, the, national, defense, research, committee, called, a, meeting, on, october, 3, 1940, wanting, an, instrument, that, could, reliably, measure, oxygen, content, in, a, mixture, of, gases, so, that, they, could, measure, oxygen, conditions, in, submarines, and, airplanes, in, response, pauling, designed, the, pauling, oxygen, meter, which, was, developed, and, manufactured, by, arnold, o, beckman, inc, after, the, war, beckman, adapted, the, oxygen, analyzers, for, use, in, incubators, for, premature, babies, 180, 186, in, 1942, pauling, successfully, submitted, a, proposal, on, the, chemical, treatment, of, protein, solutions, in, the, attempt, to, find, a, substitute, for, human, serum, for, transfusions, his, project, group, which, included, joseph, b, koepfli, and, dan, h, campbell, developed, a, possible, replacement, for, human, blood, plasma, in, transfusions, polyoxy, gelatin, oxypolygelatin, other, wartime, projects, with, more, direct, military, applications, included, work, on, explosives, rocket, propellants, and, the, patent, for, an, armor, piercing, shell, in, october, 1948, pauling, along, with, lee, a, dubridge, william, a, fowler, max, mason, and, bruce, h, sage, was, awarded, a, presidential, medal, for, merit, by, president, harry, s, truman, the, citation, credits, him, for, his, imaginative, mind, brilliant, success, and, exceptionally, meritorious, conduct, in, the, performance, of, outstanding, services, in, 1949, he, served, as, president, of, the, american, chemical, society, the, aftermath, of, the, manhattan, project, and, his, wife, ava, s, pacifism, changed, pauling, s, life, profoundly, and, he, became, a, peace, activist, in, june, 1945, a, may, johnson, bill, began, that, would, become, the, atomic, energy, act, of, 1946, signed, august, 1, 1946, in, november, 1945, pauling, spoke, to, the, independent, citizens, committee, of, the, arts, sciences, and, professions, iccasp, on, atomic, weapons, shortly, after, wife, ava, and, he, accepted, membership, on, january, 21, 1946, the, group, met, to, discuss, academic, freedom, during, which, pauling, said, there, is, of, course, always, a, threat, to, academic, freedom, as, there, is, to, the, other, aspects, of, the, freedom, and, rights, of, the, individual, in, the, continued, attacks, which, are, made, on, this, freedom, these, rights, by, the, selfish, the, overly, ambitious, the, misguided, the, unscrupulous, who, seek, to, oppress, the, great, body, of, mankind, in, order, that, they, themselves, may, profit, and, we, must, always, be, on, the, alert, against, this, threat, and, must, fight, it, with, vigor, when, it, becomes, dangerous, in, 1946, he, joined, the, emergency, committee, of, atomic, scientists, chaired, by, albert, einstein, its, mission, was, to, warn, the, public, of, the, dangers, associated, with, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, his, political, activism, prompted, the, us, state, department, to, deny, him, a, passport, in, 1952, when, he, was, invited, to, speak, at, a, scientific, conference, in, london, in, a, speech, before, the, us, senate, on, june, 6, of, the, same, year, senator, wayne, morse, publicly, denounced, the, action, of, the, state, department, and, urged, the, passport, division, to, reverse, its, decision, pauling, and, his, wife, ava, were, then, issued, a, limited, passport, to, attend, the, conference, his, full, passport, was, restored, in, 1954, shortly, before, the, ceremony, in, stockholm, where, he, received, his, first, nobel, prize, joining, einstein, bertrand, russell, and, eight, other, leading, scientists, and, intellectuals, he, signed, the, russell, einstein, manifesto, issued, july, 9, 1955, he, also, supported, the, mainau, declaration, of, july, 15, 1955, signed, by, 52, nobel, prize, laureates, in, may, 1957, working, with, washington, university, in, st, louis, professor, barry, commoner, pauling, began, to, circulate, a, petition, among, scientists, to, stop, nuclear, testing, on, january, 15, 1958, pauling, and, his, wife, presented, a, petition, to, united, nations, secretary, general, dag, hammarskj, ld, calling, for, an, end, to, the, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, it, was, signed, by, 11, 021, scientists, representing, fifty, countries, in, february, 1958, pauling, participated, in, a, publicly, televised, debate, with, the, atomic, physicist, edward, teller, about, the, actual, probability, of, fallout, causing, mutations, later, in, 1958, pauling, published, no, more, war, in, which, he, not, only, called, for, an, end, to, the, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, but, also, an, end, to, war, itself, he, proposed, that, a, world, peace, research, organization, be, set, up, as, part, of, the, united, nations, to, attack, the, problem, of, preserving, the, peace, pauling, also, supported, the, work, of, the, st, louis, citizen, s, committee, for, nuclear, information, cni, this, group, headed, by, barry, commoner, eric, reiss, m, w, friedlander, and, john, fowler, organized, a, longitudinal, study, to, measure, radioactive, strontium, 90, in, the, baby, teeth, of, children, across, north, america, the, baby, tooth, survey, published, by, louise, reiss, demonstrated, conclusively, in, 1961, that, above, ground, nuclear, testing, posed, significant, public, health, risks, in, the, form, of, radioactive, fallout, spread, primarily, via, milk, from, cows, that, had, ingested, contaminated, grass, the, committee, for, nuclear, information, is, frequently, credited, for, its, significant, contribution, to, supporting, the, test, ban, as, is, the, ground, breaking, research, conducted, by, reiss, and, the, baby, tooth, survey, public, pressure, and, the, frightening, results, of, the, cni, research, led, to, a, moratorium, on, above, ground, nuclear, weapons, testing, followed, by, the, partial, test, ban, treaty, signed, in, 1963, by, john, f, kennedy, and, nikita, khrushchev, on, the, day, that, the, treaty, went, into, force, october, 10, 1963, the, nobel, prize, committee, awarded, pauling, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, 1962, no, prize, had, previously, been, awarded, for, that, year, they, described, him, as, linus, carl, pauling, who, ever, since, 1946, has, campaigned, ceaselessly, not, only, against, nuclear, weapons, tests, not, only, against, the, spread, of, these, armaments, not, only, against, their, very, use, but, against, all, warfare, as, a, means, of, solving, international, conflicts, pauling, himself, acknowledged, his, wife, ava, s, deep, involvement, in, peace, work, and, regretted, that, she, was, not, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, with, him, many, of, pauling, s, critics, including, scientists, who, appreciated, the, contributions, that, he, had, made, in, chemistry, disagreed, with, his, political, positions, and, saw, him, as, a, na, ve, spokesman, for, soviet, communism, in, 1960, he, was, ordered, to, appear, before, the, senate, internal, security, subcommittee, which, termed, him, the, number, one, scientific, name, in, virtually, every, major, activity, of, the, communist, peace, offensive, in, this, country, a, headline, in, life, magazine, characterized, his, 1962, nobel, prize, as, a, weird, insult, from, norway, pauling, was, a, frequent, target, of, the, national, review, magazine, in, an, article, entitled, the, collaborators, in, the, magazine, s, july, 17, 1962, issue, pauling, was, referred, to, not, only, as, a, collaborator, but, as, a, fellow, traveler, of, proponents, of, soviet, style, communism, in, 1963, pauling, sued, the, magazine, its, publisher, william, rusher, and, its, editor, william, f, buckley, jr, for, 1, million, he, lost, both, his, libel, suits, and, the, 1968, appeal, unlike, his, earlier, 1963, libel, case, against, the, hearst, corporation, because, in, the, meantime, the, landmark, case, new, york, times, co, v, sullivan, had, established, the, actual, malice, standard, for, libel, lawsuits, by, public, figures, requiring, that, not, only, falsehood, but, deliberate, lying, should, be, proved, by, the, plaintiff, in, such, cases, his, peace, activism, his, frequent, travels, and, his, enthusiastic, expansion, into, chemical, biomedical, research, all, aroused, opposition, at, caltech, in, 1958, the, caltech, board, of, trustees, demanded, that, pauling, step, down, as, chairman, of, the, chemistry, and, chemical, engineering, division, 2, although, he, had, retained, tenure, as, a, full, professor, pauling, chose, to, resign, from, caltech, after, he, received, the, nobel, peace, prize, money, he, spent, the, next, three, years, at, the, center, for, the, study, of, democratic, institutions, 1963, 1967, in, 1967, he, moved, to, the, university, of, california, at, san, diego, but, remained, there, only, briefly, leaving, in, 1969, in, part, because, of, political, tensions, with, the, reagan, era, board, of, regents, 3, from, 1969, to, 1974, he, accepted, a, position, as, professor, of, chemistry, at, stanford, university, during, the, 1960s, president, lyndon, johnson, s, policy, of, increasing, america, s, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, caused, an, anti, war, movement, that, the, paulings, joined, with, enthusiasm, pauling, denounced, the, war, as, unnecessary, and, unconstitutional, he, made, speeches, signed, protest, letters, and, communicated, personally, with, the, north, vietnamese, leader, ho, chi, minh, and, gave, the, lengthy, written, response, to, president, johnson, his, efforts, were, ignored, by, the, american, government, pauling, was, awarded, the, international, lenin, peace, prize, by, the, ussr, in, 1970, he, continued, his, peace, activism, in, the, following, years, he, and, his, wife, ava, helped, to, found, the, international, league, of, humanists, in, 1974, he, was, president, of, the, scientific, advisory, board, of, the, world, union, for, protection, of, life, and, also, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, dubrovnik, philadelphia, statement, of, 1974, 1976, linus, carl, pauling, was, an, honorary, president, and, member, of, the, international, academy, of, science, munich, until, the, end, of, his, life, he, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, agreement, to, convene, a, convention, for, drafting, a, world, constitution, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, a, world, constituent, assembly, convened, to, draft, and, adopt, a, constitution, for, the, federation, of, earth, pauling, supported, a, limited, form, of, eugenics, by, suggesting, that, human, carriers, of, defective, genes, be, given, a, compulsory, visible, mark, such, as, a, forehead, tattoo, to, discourage, potential, mates, with, the, same, defect, in, order, to, reduce, the, number, of, babies, with, diseases, such, as, sickle, cell, anemia, in, 1941, at, age, 40, pauling, was, diagnosed, with, bright, s, disease, a, renal, disease, following, the, recommendations, of, thomas, addis, who, actively, recruited, ava, helen, pauling, as, nutritionist, cook, and, eventually, as, deputy, doctor, pauling, believed, he, was, able, to, control, the, disease, with, addis, s, then, unusual, low, protein, salt, free, diet, and, vitamin, supplements, thus, pauling, s, initial, and, intensely, personal, exposure, to, the, idea, of, treating, disease, with, vitamin, supplements, was, positive, in, 1965, pauling, read, niacin, therapy, in, psychiatry, by, abram, hoffer, and, theorized, vitamins, might, have, important, biochemical, effects, unrelated, to, their, prevention, of, associated, deficiency, diseases, in, 1968, pauling, published, a, brief, paper, in, science, entitled, orthomolecular, psychiatry, giving, a, name, to, the, popular, but, controversial, megavitamin, therapy, movement, of, the, 1970s, and, advocating, that, orthomolecular, therapy, the, provision, for, the, individual, person, of, the, optimum, concentrations, of, important, normal, constituents, of, the, brain, may, be, the, preferred, treatment, for, many, mentally, ill, patients, pauling, coined, the, term, orthomolecular, to, refer, to, the, practice, of, varying, the, concentration, of, substances, normally, present, in, the, body, to, prevent, and, treat, disease, his, ideas, formed, the, basis, of, orthomolecular, medicine, which, is, not, generally, practiced, by, conventional, medical, professionals, and, has, been, strongly, criticized, in, 1973, with, arthur, b, robinson, and, another, colleague, pauling, founded, the, institute, of, orthomolecular, medicine, in, menlo, park, california, which, was, soon, renamed, the, linus, pauling, institute, of, science, and, medicine, pauling, directed, research, on, vitamin, c, but, also, continued, his, theoretical, work, in, chemistry, and, physics, until, his, death, in, his, last, years, he, became, especially, interested, in, the, possible, role, of, vitamin, c, in, preventing, atherosclerosis, and, published, three, case, reports, on, the, use, of, lysine, and, vitamin, c, to, relieve, angina, pectoris, during, the, 1990s, pauling, put, forward, a, comprehensive, plan, for, the, treatment, of, heart, disease, using, lysine, and, vitamin, c, in, 1996, a, website, was, created, expounding, pauling, s, treatment, which, it, referred, to, as, pauling, therapy, proponents, of, pauling, therapy, believe, that, heart, disease, can, be, treated, and, even, cured, using, only, lysine, and, vitamin, c, and, without, drugs, or, heart, operations, pauling, s, work, on, vitamin, c, in, his, later, years, generated, much, controversy, he, was, first, introduced, to, the, concept, of, high, dose, vitamin, c, by, biochemist, irwin, stone, in, 1966, after, becoming, convinced, of, its, worth, pauling, took, 3, grams, of, vitamin, c, every, day, to, prevent, colds, excited, by, his, own, perceived, results, he, researched, the, clinical, literature, and, published, vitamin, c, and, the, common, cold, in, 1970, he, began, a, long, clinical, collaboration, with, the, british, cancer, surgeon, ewan, cameron, in, 1971, on, the, use, of, intravenous, and, oral, vitamin, c, as, cancer, therapy, for, terminal, patients, cameron, and, pauling, wrote, many, technical, papers, and, a, popular, book, cancer, and, vitamin, c, that, discussed, their, observations, pauling, made, vitamin, c, popular, with, the, public, and, eventually, published, two, studies, of, a, group, of, 100, allegedly, terminal, patients, that, claimed, vitamin, c, increased, survival, by, as, much, as, four, times, compared, to, untreated, patients, a, re, evaluation, of, the, claims, in, 1982, found, that, the, patient, groups, were, not, actually, comparable, with, the, vitamin, c, group, being, less, sick, on, entry, to, the, study, and, judged, to, be, terminal, much, earlier, than, the, comparison, group, later, clinical, trials, conducted, by, the, mayo, clinic, led, by, oncologist, dr, edward, t, creagan, also, concluded, that, high, dose, 10, 000, mg, vitamin, c, was, no, better, than, placebo, at, treating, cancer, and, that, there, was, no, benefit, to, high, dose, vitamin, c, the, failure, of, the, clinical, trials, to, demonstrate, any, benefit, resulted, in, the, conclusion, that, vitamin, c, was, not, effective, in, treating, cancer, the, medical, establishment, concluded, that, his, claims, that, vitamin, c, could, prevent, colds, or, treat, cancer, were, quackery, pauling, denounced, the, conclusions, of, these, studies, and, handling, of, the, final, study, as, fraud, and, deliberate, misrepresentation, and, criticized, the, studies, for, using, oral, rather, than, intravenous, vitamin, c, which, was, the, dosing, method, used, for, the, first, ten, days, of, pauling, s, original, study, pauling, also, criticised, the, mayo, clinic, studies, because, the, controls, were, taking, vitamin, c, during, the, trial, and, because, the, duration, of, the, treatment, with, vitamin, c, was, short, pauling, advocated, continued, high, dose, vitamin, c, for, the, rest, of, the, cancer, patient, s, life, whereas, the, mayo, clinic, patients, in, the, second, trial, were, treated, with, vitamin, c, for, a, median, of, 2, 5, months, ultimately, the, negative, findings, of, the, mayo, clinic, studies, ended, general, interest, in, vitamin, c, as, a, treatment, for, cancer, despite, this, pauling, continued, to, promote, vitamin, c, for, treating, cancer, and, the, common, cold, working, with, the, institutes, for, the, achievement, of, human, potential, to, use, vitamin, c, in, the, treatment, of, brain, injured, children, he, later, collaborated, with, the, canadian, physician, abram, hoffer, on, a, micronutrient, regime, including, high, dose, vitamin, c, as, adjunctive, cancer, therapy, a, 2009, review, also, noted, differences, between, the, studies, such, as, the, mayo, clinic, not, using, intravenous, vitamin, c, and, suggested, further, studies, into, the, role, of, vitamin, c, when, given, intravenously, results, from, most, clinical, trials, suggest, that, modest, vitamin, c, supplementation, alone, or, with, other, nutrients, offers, no, benefit, in, the, prevention, of, cancer, pauling, married, ava, helen, miller, on, june, 17, 1923, the, marriage, lasted, until, her, death, in, 1981, they, had, four, children, linus, carl, jr, 1925, 2023, became, a, psychiatrist, peter, 1931, 2003, a, crystallographer, at, university, college, london, edward, crellin, 1937, 1997, a, biologist, and, linda, helen, born, 1932, married, noted, caltech, geologist, and, glaciologist, barclay, kamb, pauling, was, raised, as, a, member, of, the, lutheran, church, but, later, joined, the, unitarian, universalist, church, two, years, before, his, death, in, a, published, dialogue, with, buddhist, philosopher, daisaku, ikeda, pauling, publicly, declared, his, atheism, on, january, 30, 1960, pauling, and, his, wife, were, using, a, cabin, about, 80, miles, 130, km, south, of, monterey, california, and, he, decided, to, go, for, a, walk, on, a, coastal, trail, he, got, lost, and, tried, to, climb, the, rocky, cliff, but, reached, a, large, overhanging, rock, about, 300, feet, 90, m, above, the, ocean, he, decided, it, was, safest, to, stay, there, and, meanwhile, he, was, reported, missing, he, spent, a, sleepless, night, on, the, cliff, before, being, found, after, almost, 24, hours, pauling, died, of, prostate, cancer, on, august, 19, 1994, at, 19, 20, at, home, in, big, sur, california, he, was, 93, years, old, a, grave, marker, for, pauling, was, placed, in, oswego, pioneer, cemetery, in, lake, oswego, oregon, by, his, sister, pauline, but, pauling, s, ashes, along, with, those, of, his, wife, were, not, buried, there, until, 2005, pauling, s, discoveries, led, to, decisive, contributions, in, a, diverse, array, of, areas, including, around, 350, publications, in, the, fields, of, quantum, mechanics, inorganic, chemistry, organic, chemistry, protein, structure, molecular, biology, and, medicine, his, work, on, chemical, bonding, marks, him, as, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, quantum, chemistry, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, was, the, standard, work, for, many, years, and, concepts, like, hybridization, and, electronegativity, remain, part, of, standard, chemistry, textbooks, while, his, valence, bond, approach, fell, short, of, accounting, quantitatively, for, some, of, the, characteristics, of, molecules, such, as, the, color, of, organometallic, complexes, and, would, later, be, eclipsed, by, the, molecular, orbital, theory, of, robert, mulliken, valence, bond, theory, still, competes, in, its, modern, form, with, molecular, orbital, theory, and, density, functional, theory, dft, as, a, way, of, describing, chemical, phenomena, pauling, s, work, on, crystal, structure, contributed, significantly, to, the, prediction, and, elucidation, of, the, structures, of, complex, minerals, and, compounds, 80, 81, his, discovery, of, the, alpha, helix, and, beta, sheet, is, a, fundamental, foundation, for, the, study, of, protein, structure, francis, crick, acknowledged, pauling, as, the, father, of, molecular, biology, his, discovery, of, sickle, cell, anemia, as, a, molecular, disease, opened, the, way, toward, examining, genetically, acquired, mutations, at, a, molecular, level, pauling, s, 1951, publication, with, robert, b, corey, and, h, r, branson, the, structure, of, proteins, two, hydrogen, bonded, helical, configurations, of, the, polypeptide, chain, was, a, key, early, finding, in, the, then, newly, emerging, field, of, molecular, biology, this, publication, was, honored, by, a, citation, for, chemical, breakthrough, award, from, the, division, of, history, of, chemistry, of, the, american, chemical, society, presented, to, the, department, of, chemistry, caltech, in, 2017, oregon, state, university, completed, construction, of, the, 77,

march, 6, 2008, the, united, states, postal, service, released, a, 41, cent, stamp, honoring, pauling, designed, by, artist, victor, stabin, his, description, reads, a, remarkably, versatile, scientist, structural, chemist, linus, pauling, 1901, 1994, won, the, 1954, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, determining, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, linking, atoms, into, molecules, his, work, in, establishing, the, field, of, molecular, biology, his, studies, of, hemoglobin, led, to, the, classification, of, sickle, cell, anemia, as, a, molecular, disease, the, other, scientists, on, this, sheet, of, stamps, included, gerty, cori, biochemist, edwin, hubble, astronomer, and, john, bardeen, physicist, california, governor, arnold, schwarzenegger, and, first, lady, maria, shriver, announced, on, may, 28, 2008, that, pauling, would, be, inducted, into, the, california, hall, of, fame, located, at, the, california, museum, for, history, women, and, the, arts, the, induction, ceremony, took, place, december, 15, 2008, pauling, s, son, was, asked, to, accept, the, honor, in, his, place, by, proclamation, of, gov, john, kitzhaber, in, the, state, of, oregon, february, 28, has, been, named, linus, pauling, day, the, linus, pauling, institute, still, exists, but, moved, in, 1996, from, palo, alto, california, to, corvallis, oregon, where, it, is, part, of, the, linus, pauling, science, center, at, oregon, state, university, the, valley, library, special, collections, at, oregon, state, university, contain, the, ava, helen, and, linus, pauling, papers, including,
