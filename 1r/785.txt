amounts, to, this, which, also, i, believe, that, government, is, best, which, governs, not, at, all, and, when, men, are, prepared, for, it, that, will, be, the, kind, of, government, which, they, will, have, but, to, speak, practically, and, as, a, citizen, unlike, those, who, call, themselves, no, government, men, i, ask, for, not, at, once, no, government, but, at, once, a, better,

nature, and, its, relation, to, the, human, condition, in, his, early, years, he, followed, transcendentalism, a, loose, and, eclectic, idealist, philosophy, advocated, by, emerson, fuller, and, alcott, they, held, that, an, ideal, spiritual, state, transcends, or, goes, beyond, the, physical, and, empirical, and, that, one, achieves, that, insight, via, personal, intuition, rather, than, religious, doctrine, in, their, view, nature, is, the, outward, sign, of, inward, spirit, expressing, the, radical, correspondence, of, visible, things, and, human, thoughts, as, emerson, wrote, in, nature, 1836, on, april, 18, 1841, thoreau, moved, in, with, the, emersons, there, from, 1841, to, 1844, he, served, as, the, children, s, tutor, he, was, also, an, editorial, assistant, repairman, and, gardener, for, a, few, months, in, 1843, he, moved, to, the, home, of, william, emerson, on, staten, island, and, tutored, the, family, s, sons, while, seeking, contacts, among, literary, men,

family, s, pencil, factory, which, he, would, continue, to, do, alongside, his, writing, and, other, work, for, most, of, his, adult, life, he, resurrected, the, process, of, making, good, pencils, with, inferior, graphite, by, using, clay, as, a, binder, the, process, of, mixing, graphite, and, clay, known, as, the, cont, process, had, been, first, patented, by, nicolas, jacques, cont, in, 1795, thoreau, made, profitable, use, of, a, graphite, source, found, in, new, hampshire, that, had, been, purchased, in, 1821, by, his, uncle, charles, dunbar, the, company, s, other, source, of, graphite, had, been, tantiusques, a, mine, operated, by, native, americans, in, sturbridge, massachusetts, later, thoreau, converted, the, pencil, factory, to, produce, plumbago, a, name, for,

accidentally, set, a, fire, that, consumed, 300, acres, 120, hectares, of, walden, woods, i, went, to, the, woods, because, i, wished, to, live, deliberately, to, front, only, the, essential, facts, of, life, and, see, if, i, could, not, learn, what, it, had, to, teach, and, not, when, i, came, to, die, discover, that, i, had, not, lived, i, did, not, wish, to, live, what, was, not, life, living, is, so, dear, nor, did, i, wish, to, practise, resignation, unless, it, was, quite, necessary, i, wanted, to, live, deep, and, suck, out, all, the, marrow, of, life, to, live, so, sturdily, and, spartan, like, as, to, put, to, rout, all, that, was, not, life, to, cut, a, broad, swath, and, shave, close, to, drive, life, into, a, corner, and, reduce, it, to, its, lowest, terms, and, if, it, proved, to, be, mean, why, then, to, get, the, whole, and, genuine, meanness, of, it, and, publish, its, meanness, to, the, world, or, if, it, were, sublime, to, know, it, by, experience, and, be, able, to, give, a, true, account, of, it, in, my, next, excursion, thoreau, felt, a, need, to, concentrate, and, work, more, on, his, writing, in, 1845, ellery, channing, told, thoreau, go, out, upon, that, build, yourself, a, hut, there, begin, the, grand, process, of, devouring, yourself, alive, i, see, no, other, alternative, no, other, hope, for, you, thus, on, july, 4, 1845, thoreau, embarked, on, a, two, year, experiment, in, simple, living, moving, to, a, small, house, he, had, built, on, land, owned, by, emerson, in, a, second, growth, forest, around, the, shores, of, walden, pond, having, had, a, request, to, build, a, hut, on, flints, pond, near, that, of, his, friend, charles, stearns, wheeler, denied, by, the, landowners, due, to, the, fairhaven, bay, incident, the, house, was, in, a, pretty, pasture, and, woodlot, of, 14, acres, 5, 7, hectares, that, emerson, had, bought, 1, 1, 2, miles, 2, 5, kilometers, from, his, family, home, whilst, there, he, wrote, his, only, extended, piece, of, literary, criticism, thomas, carlyle, and, his, works, on, july, 24, or, july, 25, 1846, thoreau, ran, into, the, local, tax, collector, sam, staples, who, asked, him, to, pay, six, years, of, delinquent, poll, taxes, thoreau, refused, because, of, his, opposition, to, the, mexican, american, war, and, slavery, and, he, spent, a, night, in, jail, because, of, this, refusal, the, next, day, thoreau, was, freed, when, someone, likely, to, have, been, his, aunt, paid, the, tax, against, his, wishes, the, experience, had, a, strong, impact, on, thoreau, in, january, and, february, 1848, he, delivered, lectures, on, the, rights, and, duties, of, the, individual, in, relation, to, government, explaining, his, tax, resistance, at, the, concord, lyceum, bronson, alcott, attended, the, lecture, writing, in, his, journal, on, january, 26, heard, thoreau, s, lecture, before, the, lyceum, on, the, relation, of, the, individual, to, the, state, an, admirable, statement, of, the, rights, of, the, individual, to, self, government, and, an, attentive, audience, his, allusions, to, the, mexican, war, to, mr, hoar, s, expulsion, from, carolina, his, own, imprisonment, in, concord, jail, for, refusal, to, pay, his, tax, mr, hoar, s, payment, of, mine, when, taken, to, prison, for, a, similar, refusal, were, all, pertinent, well, considered, and, reasoned, i, took, great, pleasure, in, this, deed, of, thoreau, s, thoreau, revised, the, lecture, into, an, essay, titled, resistance, to, civil, government, also, known, as, civil, disobedience, it, was, published, by, elizabeth, peabody, in, the, aesthetic, papers, in, may, 1849, thoreau, had, taken, up, a, version, of, percy, shelley, s, principle, in, the, political, poem, the, mask, of, anarchy, 1819, which, begins, with, the, powerful, images, of, the, unjust, forms, of, authority, of, his, time, and, then, imagines, the, stirrings, of, a, radically, new, form, of, social, action, at, walden, pond, thoreau, completed, a, first, draft, of, a, week, on, the, concord, and, merrimack, rivers, an, elegy, to, his, brother, john, describing, their, trip, to, the, white, mountains, in, 1839, thoreau, did, not, find, a, publisher, for, the, book, and, instead, printed, 1, 000, copies, at, his, own, expense, fewer, than, 300, were, sold, 234, he, self, published, on, the, advice, of, emerson, using, emerson, s, publisher, munroe, who, did, little, to, publicize, the, book, in, august, 1846, thoreau, briefly, left, walden, to, make, a, trip, to, mount, katahdin, in, maine, a, journey, later, recorded, in, ktaadn, the, first, part, of, the, maine, woods, thoreau, left, walden, pond, on, september, 6, 1847, 244, at, emerson, s, request, he, immediately, moved, back, to, the, emerson, house, to, help, emerson, s, wife, lidian, manage, the, household, while, her, husband, was, on, an, extended, trip, to, europe, over, several, years, as, he, worked, to, pay, off, his, debts, he, continuously, revised, the, manuscript, of, what, he, eventually, published, as, walden, or, life, in, the, woods, in, 1854, recounting, the, two, years, two, months, and, two, days, he, had, spent, at, walden, pond, the, book, compresses, that, time, into, a, single, calendar, year, using, the, passage, of, the, four, seasons, to, symbolize, human, development, part, memoir, and, part, spiritual, quest, walden, at, first, won, few, admirers, but, later, critics, have, regarded, it, as, a, classic, american, work, that, explores, natural, simplicity, harmony, and, beauty, as, models, for, just, social, and, cultural, conditions, the, american, poet, robert, frost, wrote, of, thoreau, in, one, book, he, surpasses, everything, we, have, had, in, america, the, american, author, john, updike, said, of, the, book, a, century, and, a, half, after, its, publication, walden, has, become, such, a, totem, of, the, back, to, nature, preservationist, anti, business, civil, disobedience, mindset, and, thoreau, so, vivid, a, protester, so, perfect, a, crank, and, hermit, saint, that, the, book, risks, being, as, revered, and, unread, as, the, bible, thoreau, moved, out, of, emerson, s, house, in, july, 1848, and, stayed, at, a, house, on, nearby, belknap, street, in, 1850, he, moved, into, a, house, at, 255, main, street, where, he, lived, until, his, death, in, the, summer, of, 1850, thoreau, and, channing, journeyed, from, boston, to, montreal, and, quebec, city, these, would, be, thoreau, s, only, travels, outside, the, united, states, it, is, as, a, result, of, this, trip, that, he, developed, lectures, that, eventually, became, a, yankee, in, canada, he, jested, that, all, he, got, from, this, adventure, was, a, cold, in, fact, this, proved, an, opportunity, to, contrast, american, civic, spirit, and, democratic, values, with, a, colony, apparently, ruled, by, illegitimate, religious, and, military, power, whereas, his, own, country, had, had, its, revolution, in, canada, history, had, failed, to, turn, in, 1851, thoreau, became, increasingly, fascinated, with, natural, history, and, narratives, of, travel, and, expedition, he, read, avidly, on, botany, and, often, wrote, observations, on, this, topic, into, his, journal, he, admired, william, bartram, and, charles, darwin, s, voyage, of, the, beagle, he, kept, detailed, observations, on, concord, s, nature, lore, recording, everything, from, how, the, fruit, ripened, over, time, to, the, fluctuating, depths, of, walden, pond, and, the, days, certain, birds, migrated, the, point, of, this, task, was, to, anticipate, the, seasons, of, nature, in, his, word, he, became, a, land, surveyor, and, continued, to, write, increasingly, detailed, observations, on, the, natural, history, of, the, town, covering, an, area, of, 26, square, miles, 67, square, kilometers, in, his, journal, a, two, million, word, document, he, kept, for, 24, years, he, also, kept, a, series, of, notebooks, and, these, observations, became, the, source, of, his, late, writings, on, natural, history, such, as, autumnal, tints, the, succession, of, trees, and, wild, apples, an, essay, lamenting, the, destruction, of, the, local, wild, apple, species, with, the, rise, of, environmental, history, and, ecocriticism, as, academic, disciplines, several, new, readings, of, thoreau, began, to, emerge, showing, him, to, have, been, both, a, philosopher, and, an, analyst, of, ecological, patterns, in, fields, and, woodlots, for, instance, the, succession, of, forest, trees, shows, that, he, used, experimentation, and, analysis, to, explain, how, forests, regenerate, after, fire, or, human, destruction, through, the, dispersal, of, seeds, by, winds, or, animals, in, this, lecture, first, presented, to, a, cattle, show, in, concord, and, considered, his, greatest, contribution, to, ecology, thoreau, explained, why, one, species, of, tree, can, grow, in, a, place, where, a, different, tree, did, previously, he, observed, that, squirrels, often, carry, nuts, far, from, the, tree, from, which, they, fell, to, create, stashes, these, seeds, are, likely, to, germinate, and, grow, should, the, squirrel, die, or, abandon, the, stash, he, credited, the, squirrel, for, performing, a, great, service, in, the, economy, of, the, universe, he, traveled, to, canada, east, once, cape, cod, four, times, and, maine, three, times, these, landscapes, inspired, his, excursion, books, a, yankee, in, canada, cape, cod, and, the, maine, woods, in, which, travel, itineraries, frame, his, thoughts, about, geography, history, and, philosophy, other, travels, took, him, southwest, to, philadelphia, and, new, york, city, in, 1854, and, west, across, the, great, lakes, region, in, 1861, when, he, visited, niagara, falls, detroit, chicago, milwaukee, st, paul, and, mackinac, island, he, was, provincial, in, his, own, travels, but, he, read, widely, about, travel, in, other, lands, he, devoured, all, the, first, hand, travel, accounts, available, in, his, day, at, a, time, when, the, last, unmapped, regions, of, the, earth, were, being, explored, he, read, magellan, and, james, cook, the, arctic, explorers, john, franklin, alexander, mackenzie, and, william, parry, david, livingstone, and, richard, francis, burton, on, africa, lewis, and, clark, and, hundreds, of, lesser, known, works, by, explorers, and, literate, travelers, astonishing, amounts, of, reading, fed, his, endless, curiosity, about, the, peoples, cultures, religions, and, natural, history, of, the, world, and, left, its, traces, as, commentaries, in, his, voluminous, journals, he, processed, everything, he, read, in, the, local, laboratory, of, his, concord, experience, among, his, famous, aphorisms, is, his, advice, to, live, at, home, like, a, traveler, after, john, brown, s, raid, on, harpers, ferry, many, prominent, voices, in, the, abolitionist, movement, distanced, themselves, from, brown, or, damned, him, with, faint, praise, thoreau, was, disgusted, by, this, and, he, composed, a, key, speech, a, plea, for, captain, john, brown, which, was, uncompromising, in, its, defense, of, brown, and, his, actions, thoreau, s, speech, proved, persuasive, the, abolitionist, movement, began, to, accept, brown, as, a, martyr, and, by, the, time, of, the, american, civil, war, entire, armies, of, the, north, were, literally, singing, brown, s, praises, as, a, biographer, of, brown, put, it, if, as, alfred, kazin, suggests, without, john, brown, there, would, have, been, no, civil, war, we, would, add, that, without, the, concord, transcendentalists, john, brown, would, have, had, little, cultural, impact, thoreau, contracted, tuberculosis, in, 1835, and, suffered, from, it, sporadically, afterwards, in, 1860, following, a, late, night, excursion, to, count, the, rings, of, tree, stumps, during, a, rainstorm, he, became, ill, with, bronchitis, his, health, declined, with, brief, periods, of, remission, and, he, eventually, became, bedridden, recognizing, the, terminal, nature, of, his, disease, thoreau, spent, his, last, years, revising, and, editing, his, unpublished, works, particularly, the, maine, woods, and, excursions, and, petitioning, publishers, to, print, revised, editions, of, a, week, and, walden, he, wrote, letters, and, journal, entries, until, he, became, too, weak, to, continue, his, friends, were, alarmed, at, his, diminished, appearance, and, were, fascinated, by, his, tranquil, acceptance, of, death, when, his, aunt, louisa, asked, him, in, his, last, weeks, if, he, had, made, his, peace, with, god, thoreau, responded, i, did, not, know, we, had, ever, quarreled, aware, he, was, dying, thoreau, s, last, words, were, now, comes, good, sailing, followed, by, two, lone, words, moose, and, indian, he, died, on, may, 6, 1862, at, age, 44, amos, bronson, alcott, planned, the, service, and, read, selections, from, thoreau, s, works, and, channing, presented, a, hymn, emerson, wrote, the, eulogy, spoken, at, the, funeral, thoreau, was, buried, in, the, dunbar, family, plot, his, remains, and, those, of, members, of, his, immediate, family, were, eventually, moved, to, sleepy, hollow, cemetery, in, concord, massachusetts, most, of, the, luxuries, and, many, of, the, so, called, comforts, of, life, are, not, only, not, indispensable, but, positive, hindrances, to, the, elevation, of, mankind, thoreau, was, an, early, advocate, of, recreational, hiking, and, canoeing, of, conserving, natural, resources, on, private, land, and, of, preserving, wilderness, as, public, land, he, was, himself, a, highly, skilled, canoeist, nathaniel, hawthorne, after, a, ride, with, him, noted, that, mr, thoreau, managed, the, boat, so, perfectly, either, with, two, paddles, or, with, one, that, it, seemed, instinct, with, his, own, will, and, to, require, no, physical, effort, to, guide, it, he, was, not, a, strict, vegetarian, though, he, said, he, preferred, that, diet, and, advocated, it, as, a, means, of, self, improvement, he, wrote, in, walden, the, practical, objection, to, animal, food, in, my, case, was, its, uncleanness, and, besides, when, i, had, caught, and, cleaned, and, cooked, and, eaten, my, fish, they, seemed, not, to, have, fed, me, essentially, it, was, insignificant, and, unnecessary, and, cost, more, than, it, came, to, a, little, bread, or, a, few, potatoes, would, have, done, as, well, with, less, trouble, and, filth, thoreau, neither, rejected, civilization, nor, fully, embraced, wilderness, instead, he, sought, a, middle, ground, the, pastoral, realm, that, integrates, nature, and, culture, his, philosophy, required, that, he, be, a, didactic, arbitrator, between, the, wilderness, he, based, so, much, on, and, the, spreading, mass, of, humanity, in, north, america, he, decried, the, latter, endlessly, but, felt, that, a, teacher, needs, to, be, close, to, those, who, needed, to, hear, what, he, wanted, to, tell, them, the, wildness, he, enjoyed, was, the, nearby, swamp, or, forest, and, he, preferred, partially, cultivated, country, his, idea, of, being, far, in, the, recesses, of, the, wilderness, of, maine, was, to, travel, the, logger, s, path, and, the, indian, trail, but, he, also, hiked, on, pristine, land, in, an, essay, titled, henry, david, thoreau, philosopher, environmental, historian, roderick, nash, wrote, thoreau, left, concord, in, 1846, for, the, first, of, three, trips, to, northern, maine, his, expectations, were, high, because, he, hoped, to, find, genuine, primeval, america, but, contact, with, real, wilderness, in, maine, affected, him, far, differently, than, had, the, idea, of, wilderness, in, concord, instead, of, coming, out, of, the, woods, with, a, deepened, appreciation, of, the, wilds, thoreau, felt, a, greater, respect, for, civilization, and, realized, the, necessity, of, balance, of, alcohol, thoreau, wrote, i, would, fain, keep, sober, always, i, believe, that, water, is, the, only, drink, for, a, wise, man, wine, is, not, so, noble, a, liquor, of, all, ebriosity, who, does, not, prefer, to, be, intoxicated, by, the, air, he, breathes, thoreau, never, married, and, was, childless, in, 1840, when, he, was, 23, he, proposed, to, eighteen, year, old, ellen, sewall, but, she, refused, him, on, the, advice, of, her, father, sophia, foord, proposed, to, him, but, he, rejected, her, thoreau, s, sexuality, has, long, been, the, subject, of, speculation, including, by, his, contemporaries, critics, have, called, him, heterosexual, homosexual, or, asexual, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, he, had, physical, relations, with, anyone, man, or, woman, bronson, alcott, wrote, that, thoreau, seemed, to, have, no, temptations, all, those, strong, wants, that, do, battle, with, other, men, s, nature, he, knew, not, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, homoerotic, sentiments, run, through, his, writings, and, concluded, that, he, was, homosexual, the, elegy, sympathy, was, inspired, by, the, eleven, year, old, edmund, sewall, who, had, just, spent, five, days, in, the, thoreau, household, in, 1839, one, scholar, has, suggested, that, he, wrote, the, poem, to, edmund, because, he, could, not, bring, himself, to, write, it, to, edmund, s, sister, anna, and, another, that, thoreau, s, emotional, experiences, with, women, are, memorialized, under, a, camouflage, of, masculine, pronouns, but, other, scholars, dismiss, this, it, has, been, argued, that, the, long, paean, in, walden, to, the, french, canadian, woodchopper, alek, therien, which, includes, allusions, to, achilles, and, patroclus, is, an, expression, of, conflicted, desire, in, some, of, thoreau, s, writing, there, is, the, sense, of, a, secret, self, in, 1840, he, writes, in, his, journal, my, friend, is, the, apology, for, my, life, in, him, are, the, spaces, which, my, orbit, traverses, thoreau, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, moral, reformers, of, his, time, and, this, may, have, instilled, anxiety, and, guilt, over, sexual, desire, thoreau, was, fervently, against, slavery, and, actively, supported, the, abolitionist, movement, he, participated, as, a, conductor, in, the, underground, railroad, delivered, lectures, that, attacked, the, fugitive, slave, law, and, in, opposition, to, the, popular, opinion, of, the, time, supported, radical, abolitionist, militia, leader, john, brown, and, his, party, two, weeks, after, the, ill, fated, raid, on, harpers, ferry, and, in, the, weeks, leading, up, to, brown, s, execution, thoreau, delivered, a, speech, to, the, citizens, of, concord, massachusetts, in, which, he, compared, the, american, government, to, pontius, pilate, and, likened, brown, s, execution, to, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, christ, some, eighteen, hundred, years, ago, christ, was, crucified, this, morning, perchance, captain, brown, was, hung, these, are, the, two, ends, of, a, chain, which, is, not, without, its, links, he, is, not, old, brown, any, longer, he, is, an, angel, of, light, in, the, last, days, of, john, brown, thoreau, described, the, words, and, deeds, of, john, brown, as, noble, and, an, example, of, heroism, in, addition, he, lamented, the, newspaper, editors, who, dismissed, brown, and, his, scheme, as, crazy, thoreau, was, a, proponent, of, limited, government, and, individualism, although, he, was, hopeful, that, mankind, could, potentially, have, through, self, betterment, the, kind, of, government, which, governs, not, at, all, he, distanced, himself, from, contemporary, no, government, men, anarchists, writing, i, ask, for, not, at, once, no, government, but, at, once, a, better, government, thoreau, deemed, the, evolution, from, absolute, monarchy, to, limited, monarchy, to, democracy, as, a, progress, toward, true, respect, for, the, individual, and, theorized, about, further, improvements, towards, recognizing, and, organizing, the, rights, of, man, echoing, this, belief, he, went, on, to, write, there, will, never, be, a, really, free, and, enlightened, state, until, the, state, comes, to, recognize, the, individual, as, a, higher, and, independent, power, from, which, all, its, power, and, authority, are, derived, and, treats, him, accordingly, it, is, on, this, basis, that, thoreau, could, so, strongly, inveigh, against, the, british, administration, and, catholicism, in, a, yankee, in, canada, despotic, authority, thoreau, argued, had, crushed, the, people, s, sense, of, ingenuity, and, enterprise, the, canadian, habitants, had, been, reduced, in, his, view, to, a, perpetual, childlike, state, ignoring, the, recent, rebellions, he, argued, that, there, would, be, no, revolution, in, the, st, lawrence, river, valley, although, thoreau, believed, resistance, to, unjustly, exercised, authority, could, be, both, violent, exemplified, in, his, support, for, john, brown, and, nonviolent, his, own, example, of, tax, resistance, as, described, in, resistance, to, civil, government, he, regarded, pacifist, nonresistance, as, temptation, to, passivity, writing, let, not, our, peace, be, proclaimed, by, the, rust, on, our, swords, or, our, inability, to, draw, them, from, their, scabbards, but, let, her, at, least, have, so, much, work, on, her, hands, as, to, keep, those, swords, bright, and, sharp, furthermore, in, a, formal, lyceum, debate, in, 1841, he, debated, the, subject, is, it, ever, proper, to, offer, forcible, resistance, arguing, the, affirmative, likewise, his, condemnation, of, the, mexican, american, war, did, not, stem, from, pacifism, but, rather, because, he, considered, mexico, unjustly, overrun, and, conquered, by, a, foreign, army, as, a, means, to, expand, the, slave, territory, thoreau, was, ambivalent, towards, industrialization, and, capitalism, on, one, hand, he, regarded, commerce, as, unexpectedly, confident, and, serene, adventurous, and, unwearied, and, expressed, admiration, for, its, associated, cosmopolitanism, writing, i, am, refreshed, and, expanded, when, the, freight, train, rattles, past, me, and, i, smell, the, stores, which, go, dispensing, their, odors, all, the, way, from, long, wharf, to, lake, champlain, reminding, me, of, foreign, parts, of, coral, reefs, and, indian, oceans, and, tropical, climes, and, the, extent, of, the, globe, i, feel, more, like, a, citizen, of, the, world, at, the, sight, of, the, palm, leaf, which, will, cover, so, many, flaxen, new, england, heads, the, next, summer, on, the, other, hand, he, wrote, disparagingly, of, the, factory, system, i, cannot, believe, that, our, factory, system, is, the, best, mode, by, which, men, may, get, clothing, the, condition, of, the, operatives, is, becoming, every, day, more, like, that, of, the, english, and, it, cannot, be, wondered, at, since, as, far, as, i, have, heard, or, observed, the, principal, object, is, not, that, mankind, may, be, well, and, honestly, clad, but, unquestionably, that, the, corporations, may, be, enriched, thoreau, also, favored, the, protection, of, animals, and, wild, areas, free, trade, and, taxation, for, schools, and, highways, and, espoused, views, that, at, least, in, part, align, with, what, is, today, known, as, bioregionalism, he, disapproved, of, the, subjugation, of, native, americans, slavery, philistinism, technological, utopianism, and, what, can, be, regarded, in, today, s, terms, as, consumerism, mass, entertainment, and, frivolous, applications, of, technology, thoreau, was, influenced, by, indian, spiritual, thought, in, walden, there, are, many, overt, references, to, the, sacred, texts, of, india, for, example, in, the, first, chapter, economy, he, writes, how, much, more, admirable, the, bhagvat, geeta, than, all, the, ruins, of, the, east, american, philosophy, an, encyclopedia, classes, him, as, one, of, several, figures, who, took, a, more, pantheist, or, pandeist, approach, by, rejecting, views, of, god, as, separate, from, the, world, also, a, characteristic, of, hinduism, furthermore, in, the, pond, in, winter, he, equates, walden, pond, with, the, sacred, ganges, river, writing, in, the, morning, i, bathe, my, intellect, in, the, stupendous, and, cosmogonal, philosophy, of, the, bhagvat, geeta, since, whose, composition, years, of, the, gods, have, elapsed, and, in, comparison, with, which, our, modern, world, and, its, literature, seem, puny, and, trivial, and, i, doubt, if, that, philosophy, is, not, to, be, referred, to, a, previous, state, of, existence, so, remote, is, its, sublimity, from, our, conceptions, i, lay, down, the, book, and, go, to, my, well, for, water, and, lo, there, i, meet, the, servant, of, the, brahmin, priest, of, brahma, and, vishnu, and, indra, who, still, sits, in, his, temple, on, the, ganges, reading, the, vedas, or, dwells, at, the, root, of, a, tree, with, his, crust, and, water, jug, i, meet, his, servant, come, to, draw, water, for, his, master, and, our, buckets, as, it, were, grate, together, in, the, same, well, the, pure, walden, water, is, mingled, with, the, sacred, water, of, the, ganges, thoreau, was, aware, his, ganges, imagery, could, have, been, factual, he, wrote, about, ice, harvesting, at, walden, pond, and, he, knew, that, new, england, s, ice, merchants, were, shipping, ice, to, foreign, ports, including, calcutta, additionally, thoreau, followed, various, hindu, customs, including, a, diet, largely, consisting, of, rice, it, was, fit, that, i, should, live, on, rice, mainly, who, loved, so, well, the, philosophy, of, india, flute, playing, reminiscent, of, the, favorite, musical, pastime, of, krishna, and, yoga, in, an, 1849, letter, to, his, friend, h, g, o, blake, he, wrote, about, yoga, and, its, meaning, to, him, free, in, this, world, as, the, birds, in, the, air, disengaged, from, every, kind, of, chains, those, who, practice, yoga, gather, in, brahma, the, certain, fruits, of, their, works, depend, upon, it, that, rude, and, careless, as, i, am, i, would, fain, practice, the, yoga, faithfully, the, yogi, absorbed, in, contemplation, contributes, in, his, degree, to, creation, he, breathes, a, divine, perfume, he, hears, wonderful, things, divine, forms, traverse, him, without, tearing, him, and, united, to, the, nature, which, is, proper, to, him, he, goes, he, acts, as, animating, original, matter, to, some, extent, and, at, rare, intervals, even, i, am, a, yogi, thoreau, read, contemporary, works, in, the, new, science, of, biology, including, the, works, of, alexander, von, humboldt, charles, darwin, and, asa, gray, charles, darwin, s, staunchest, american, ally, thoreau, was, deeply, influenced, by, humboldt, especially, his, work, cosmos, in, 1859, thoreau, purchased, and, read, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, unlike, many, natural, historians, at, the, time, including, louis, agassiz, who, publicly, opposed, darwinism, in, favor, of, a, static, view, of, nature, thoreau, was, immediately, enthusiastic, about, the, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, and, endorsed, it, stating, the, development, theory, implies, a, greater, vital, force, in, nature, because, it, is, more, flexible, and, accommodating, and, equivalent, to, a, sort, of, constant, new, creation, a, quote, from, on, the, origin, of, species, follows, this, sentence, thoreau, s, careful, observations, and, devastating, conclusions, have, rippled, into, time, becoming, stronger, as, the, weaknesses, thoreau, noted, have, become, more, pronounced, events, that, seem, to, be, completely, unrelated, to, his, stay, at, walden, pond, have, been, influenced, by, it, including, the, national, park, system, the, british, labor, movement, the, creation, of, india, the, civil, rights, movement, the, hippie, revolution, the, environmental, movement, and, the, wilderness, movement, today, thoreau, s, words, are, quoted, with, feeling, by, liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and, conservatives, alike, thoreau, s, political, writings, had, little, impact, during, his, lifetime, as, his, contemporaries, did, not, see, him, as, a, theorist, or, as, a, radical, viewing, him, instead, as, a, naturalist, they, either, dismissed, or, ignored, his, political, essays, including, civil, disobedience, the, only, two, complete, books, as, opposed, to, essays, that, were, published, in, his, lifetime, walden, and, a, week, on, the, concord, and, merrimack, rivers, 1849, both, dealt, with, nature, in, which, he, loved, to, wander, his, obituary, was, lumped, in, with, others, rather, than, as, a, separate, article, in, an, 1862, yearbook, critics, and, the, public, continued, either, to, disdain, or, to, ignore, thoreau, for, years, but, the, publication, of, extracts, from, his, journal, in, the, 1880s, by, his, friend, h, g, o, blake, and, of, a, definitive, set, of, thoreau, s, works, by, the, riverside, press, between, 1893, and, 1906, led, to, the, rise, of, what, literary, historian, f, l, pattee, called, a, thoreau, cult, thoreau, s, writings, went, on, to, influence, many, public, figures, political, leaders, and, reformers, like, mohandas, gandhi, u, s, president, john, f, kennedy, american, civil, rights, activist, martin, luther, king, jr, u, s, supreme, court, justice, william, o, douglas, and, russian, author, leo, tolstoy, all, spoke, of, being, strongly, affected, by, thoreau, s, work, particularly, civil, disobedience, as, did, right, wing, theorist, frank, chodorov, devoted, an, entire, issue, of, his, monthly, analysis, to, an, appreciation, of, thoreau, thoreau, also, influenced, many, artists, and, authors, including, edward, abbey, willa, cather, marcel, proust, william, butler, yeats, sinclair, lewis, ernest, hemingway, upton, sinclair, e, b, white, lewis, mumford, frank, lloyd, wright, alexander, posey, and, gustav, stickley, thoreau, also, influenced, naturalists, like, john, burroughs, john, muir, e, o, wilson, edwin, way, teale, joseph, wood, krutch, b, f, skinner, david, brower, and, loren, eiseley, who, publishers, weekly, called, the, modern, thoreau, thoreau, s, friend, william, ellery, channing, published, his, first, biography, thoreau, the, poet, naturalist, in, 1873, english, writer, henry, stephens, salt, wrote, a, biography, of, thoreau, in, 1890, which, popularized, thoreau, s, ideas, in, britain, george, bernard, shaw, edward, carpenter, and, robert, blatchford, were, among, those, who, became, thoreau, enthusiasts, as, a, result, of, salt, s, advocacy, mohandas, gandhi, first, read, walden, in, 1906, while, working, as, a, civil, rights, activist, in, johannesburg, south, africa, gandhi, first, read, civil, disobedience, while, he, sat, in, a, south, african, prison, for, the, crime, of, nonviolently, protesting, discrimination, against, the, indian, population, in, the, transvaal, the, essay, galvanized, gandhi, who, wrote, and, published, a, synopsis, of, thoreau, s, argument, calling, what, he, termed, its, incisive, logic, unanswerable, and, referring, to, thoreau, as, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, moral, men, america, has, produced, he, told, american, reporter, webb, miller, ideas, influenced, me, greatly, i, adopted, some, of, them, and, recommended, the, study, of, thoreau, to, all, of, my, friends, who, were, helping, me, in, the, cause, of, indian, independence, why, i, actually, took, the, name, of, my, movement, from, thoreau, s, essay, on, the, duty, of, civil, disobedience, written, about, 80, years, ago, martin, luther, king, jr, noted, in, his, autobiography, that, his, first, encounter, with, the, idea, of, nonviolent, resistance, was, reading, on, civil, disobedience, in, 1944, while, attending, morehouse, college, he, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, it, was, here, in, this, courageous, new, englander, s, refusal, to, pay, his, taxes, and, his, choice, of, jail, rather, than, support, a, war, that, would, spread, slavery, s, territory, into, mexico, i, made, my, first, contact, with, the, theory, of, nonviolent, resistance, fascinated, by, the, idea, of, refusing, to, cooperate, with, an, evil, system, i, was, so, deeply, moved, that, i, reread, the, work, several, times, i, became, convinced, that, noncooperation, with, evil, is, as, much, a, moral, obligation, as, is, cooperation, with, good, no, other, person, has, been, more, eloquent, and, passionate, in, getting, this, idea, across, than, henry, david, thoreau, as, a, result, of, his, writings, and, personal, witness, we, are, the, heirs, of, a, legacy, of, creative, protest, the, teachings, of, thoreau, came, alive, in, our, civil, rights, movement, indeed, they, are, more, alive, than, ever, before, whether, expressed, in, a, sit, in, at, lunch, counters, a, freedom, ride, into, mississippi, a, peaceful, protest, in, albany, georgia, a, bus, boycott, in, montgomery, alabama, these, are, outgrowths, of, thoreau, s, insistence, that, evil, must, be, resisted, and, that, no, moral, man, can, patiently, adjust, to, injustice, american, psychologist, b, f, skinner, wrote, that, he, carried, a, copy, of, thoreau, s, walden, with, him, in, his, youth, in, walden, two, published, in, 1948, skinner, wrote, about, a, fictional, utopian, community, of, about, 1, 000, members, inspired, by, the, life, of, henry, thoreau, thoreau, and, his, fellow, transcendentalists, from, concord, massachusetts, were, also, a, major, inspiration, for, the, american, composer, charles, ives, whose, 1915, piano, sonata, no, 2, known, as, the, concord, sonata, features, impressionistic, pictures, of, emerson, and, thoreau, and, includes, a, part, for, flute, thoreau, s, instrument, in, its, 4th, movement, actor, ron, thompson, did, a, dramatic, portrayal, of, henry, david, thoreau, in, the, 1976, nbc, television, series, the, rebels, thoreau, s, ideas, have, impacted, and, resonated, with, various, strains, in, the, anarchist, movement, with, emma, goldman, referring, to, him, as, the, greatest, american, anarchist, green, anarchism, and, anarcho, primitivism, in, particular, have, both, derived, inspiration, and, ecological, points, of, view, from, the, writings, of, thoreau, john, zerzan, included, thoreau, s, text, excursions, 1863, in, his, edited, compilation, of, works, in, the, anarcho, primitivist, tradition, titled, against, civilization, readings, and, reflections, additionally, murray, rothbard, the, founder, of, anarcho, capitalism, has, opined, that, thoreau, was, one, of, the, great, intellectual, heroes, of, his, movement, thoreau, was, also, an, important, influence, on, late, 19th, century, anarchist, naturism, globally, thoreau, s, concepts, also, held, importance, within, individualist, anarchist, circles, in, spain, france, and, portugal, for, the, 200th, anniversary, of, his, birth, publishers, released, several, new, editions, of, his, work, a, recreation, of, walden, s, 1902, edition, with, illustrations, a, picture, book, with, excerpts, from, walden, and, an, annotated, collection, of, thoreau, s, essays, on, slavery, the, united, states, postal, service, issued, a, commemorative, stamp, honoring, thoreau, on, may, 23, 2017, in, concord, ma, thoreau, s, work, and, career, received, little, attention, from, his, contemporaries, until, 1865, when, the, north, american, review, published, james, russell, lowell, s, review, of, various, papers, of, thoreau, s, that, emerson, had, collected, and, edited, lowell, s, essay, letters, to, various, persons, which, he, republished, as, a, chapter, in, his, book, my, study, windows, derided, thoreau, as, a, humorless, poseur, trafficking, in, commonplaces, a, sentimentalist, lacking, in, imagination, a, diogenes, in, his, barrel, resentfully, criticizing, what, he, could, not, attain, lowell, s, caustic, analysis, influenced, scottish, author, robert, louis, stevenson, who, criticized, thoreau, as, a, skulker, saying, he, did, not, wish, virtue, to, go, out, of, him, among, his, fellow, men, but, slunk, into, a, corner, to, hoard, it, for, himself, nathaniel, hawthorne, had, mixed, feelings, about, thoreau, he, noted, that, he, is, a, keen, and, delicate, observer, of, nature, a, genuine, observer, which, i, suspect, is, almost, as, rare, a, character, as, even, an, original, poet, and, nature, in, return, for, his, love, seems, to, adopt, him, as, her, especial, child, and, shows, him, secrets, which, few, others, are, allowed, to, witness, on, the, other, hand, he, also, wrote, that, thoreau, repudiated, all, regular, modes, of, getting, a, living, and, seems, inclined, to, lead, a, sort, of, indian, life, among, civilized, men, in, a, similar, vein, poet, john, greenleaf, whittier, detested, what, he, deemed, to, be, the, wicked, and, heathenish, message, of, walden, claiming, that, thoreau, wanted, man, to, lower, himself, to, the, level, of, a, woodchuck, and, walk, on, four, legs, in, response, to, such, criticisms, the, english, novelist, george, eliot, writing, decades, later, for, the, westminster, review, characterized, such, critics, as, uninspired, and, narrow, minded, people, very, wise, in, their, own, eyes, who, would, have, every, man, s, life, ordered, according, to, a, particular, pattern, and, who, are, intolerant, of, every, existence, the, utility, of, which, is, not, palpable, to, them, may, pooh, pooh, mr, thoreau, and, this, episode, in, his, history, as, unpractical, and, dreamy, thoreau, himself, also, responded, to, the, criticism, in, a, paragraph, of, his, work, walden, by, highlighting, what, he, felt, was, the, irrelevance, of, their, inquiries, i, should, not, obtrude, my, affairs, so, much, on, the, notice, of, my, readers, if, very, particular, inquiries, had, not, been, made, by, my, townsmen, concerning, my, mode, of, life, which, some, would, call, impertinent, though, they, do, not, appear, to, me, at, all, impertinent, but, considering, the, circumstances, very, natural, and, pertinent, some, have, asked, what, i, got, to, eat, if, i, did, not, feel, lonesome, if, i, was, not, afraid, and, the, like, others, have, been, curious, to, learn, what, portion, of, my, income, i, devoted, to, charitable, purposes, and, some, who, have, large, families, how, many, poor, children, i, maintained, unfortunately, i, am, confined, to, this, theme, by, the, narrowness, of, my, experience, moreover, i, on, my, side, require, of, every, writer, first, or, last, a, simple, and, sincere, account, of, his, own, life, and, not, merely, what, he, has, heard, of, other, men, s, lives, i, trust, that, none, will, stretch, the, seams, in, putting, on, the, coat, for, it, may, do, good, service, to, him, whom, it, fits, recent, criticism, has, accused, thoreau, of, hypocrisy, misanthropy, and, being, sanctimonious, based, on, his, writings, in, walden, although, these, criticisms, have, been, regarded, as, highly, selective, many, of, thoreau, s, works, were, not, published, during, his, lifetime, including, his, journals, and, numerous, unfinished, manuscripts
