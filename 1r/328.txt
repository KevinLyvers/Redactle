replied, i, think, a, writer, s, duty, is, to, be, a, writer, and, if, he, can, be, a, good, writer, he, is, doing, his, duty, besides, i, think, of, my, own, opinions, as, being, superficial, for, example, i, am, a, conservative, i, hate, the, communists, i, hate, the, nazis, i, hate, the, anti, semites, and, so, on, but, i, don, t, allow, these, opinions, to, find, their, way, into, my, writings, except, of, course, when, i, was, greatly, elated, about, the, six, day, war, generally, speaking, i, think, of, keeping, them, in, watertight, compartments, everybody, knows, my, opinions, but, as, for, my, dreams, and, my, stories, they, should, be, allowed, their, full, freedom, i, think, i, don, t, want, to, intrude, into, them, i, m, writing, fiction, not, fables, in, the, 1980s, towards, the, end, of, his, life, borges, regained, his, earlier, faith, in, democracy, and, held, it, out, as, the, only, hope, for, argentina, in, 1983, borges, applauded, the, election, of, the, radical, civic, union, s, ra, l, alfons, n, and, welcomed, the, end, of, military, rule, with, the, following, words, i, once, wrote, that, democracy, is, the, abuse, of, statistics, on, october, 30, 1983, argentine, democracy, refuted, me, splendidly, splendidly, and, resoundingly, borges, recurrently, declared, himself, a, spencerian, anarchist, who, believes, in, the, individual, and, not, in, the, state, due, to, his, father, s, influence, in, an, interview, with, richard, burgin, during, the, late, 1960s, borges, described, himself, as, a, mild, adherent, of, classical, liberalism, he, further, recalled, that, his, opposition, to, communism, and, to, marxism, was, absorbed, in, his, childhood, stating, well, i, have, been, brought, up, to, think, that, the, individual, should, be, strong, and, the, state, should, be, weak, i, couldn, t, be, enthusiastic, about, theories, where, the, state, is, more, important, than, the, individual, after, the, overthrow, via, coup, d, tat, of, president, juan, domingo, per, n, in, 1955, borges, supported, efforts, to, purge, argentina, s, government, of, peronists, and, dismantle, the, former, president, s, welfare, state, he, was, enraged, that, the, communist, party, of, argentina, opposed, these, measures, and, sharply, criticized, them, in, lectures, and, in, print, borges, s, opposition, to, the, party, in, this, matter, ultimately, led, to, a, permanent, rift, with, his, longtime, lover, argentine, communist, estela, canto, in, a, 1956, interview, given, to, el, hogar, borges, stated, that, are, in, favor, of, totalitarian, regimes, and, systematically, combat, freedom, of, thought, oblivious, of, the, fact, that, the, principal, victims, of, dictatorships, are, precisely, intelligence, and, culture, he, elaborated, many, people, are, in, favor, of, dictatorships, because, they, allow, them, to, avoid, thinking, for, themselves, everything, is, presented, to, them, ready, made, there, are, even, agencies, of, the, state, that, supply, them, with, opinions, passwords, slogans, and, even, idols, to, exalt, or, cast, down, according, to, the, prevailing, wind, or, in, keeping, with, the, directives, of, the, thinking, heads, of, the, single, party, in, later, years, borges, frequently, expressed, contempt, for, marxist, and, communist, authors, poets, and, intellectuals, in, an, interview, with, burgin, borges, referred, to, chilean, poet, pablo, neruda, as, a, very, fine, poet, but, a, very, mean, man, for, unconditionally, supporting, the, soviet, union, and, demonizing, the, united, states, borges, commented, about, neruda, now, he, knows, that, s, rubbish, in, the, same, interview, borges, also, criticized, famed, poet, and, playwright, federico, garc, a, lorca, who, was, abducted, by, nationalist, soldiers, and, executed, without, trial, during, the, spanish, civil, war, in, borges, s, opinion, lorca, s, poetry, and, plays, when, examined, against, his, tragic, death, appeared, better, than, they, actually, were, in, 1934, argentine, ultra, nationalists, sympathetic, to, adolf, hitler, and, the, nazi, party, asserted, borges, was, secretly, jewish, and, by, implication, not, truly, argentinian, borges, responded, with, the, essay, yo, jud, o, i, a, jew, a, reference, to, the, old, phrase, yo, argentino, i, an, argentine, uttered, by, potential, victims, during, pogroms, against, argentine, jews, to, signify, one, was, not, jewish, in, the, essay, borges, declares, he, would, be, proud, to, be, a, jew, and, remarks, that, any, pure, castilian, is, likely, to, come, from, ancient, jewish, descent, from, a, millennium, ago, both, before, and, during, the, second, world, war, borges, regularly, published, essays, attacking, the, nazi, police, state, and, its, racist, ideology, his, outrage, was, fueled, by, his, deep, love, for, german, literature, in, an, essay, published, in, 1937, borges, attacked, the, nazi, party, s, use, of, children, s, books, to, inflame, antisemitism, he, wrote, i, don, t, know, if, the, world, can, do, without, german, civilization, but, i, do, know, that, its, corruption, by, the, teachings, of, hatred, is, a, crime, in, a, 1938, essay, borges, reviewed, an, anthology, which, rewrote, german, authors, of, the, past, to, fit, the, nazi, party, line, he, was, disgusted, by, what, he, described, as, germany, s, chaotic, descent, into, darkness, and, the, attendant, rewriting, of, history, he, argued, that, such, books, sacrificed, the, german, people, s, culture, history, and, integrity, in, the, name, of, restoring, their, national, honour, such, use, of, children, s, books, for, propaganda, he, writes, perfect, the, criminal, arts, of, barbarians, in, a, 1944, essay, borges, postulated, nazism, suffers, from, unreality, like, erigena, s, hell, it, is, uninhabitable, men, can, only, die, for, it, lie, for, it, wound, and, kill, for, it, no, one, in, the, intimate, depths, of, his, being, can, wish, it, to, triumph, i, shall, risk, this, conjecture, hitler, wants, to, be, defeated, hitler, is, blindly, collaborating, with, the, inevitable, armies, that, will, annihilate, him, as, the, metal, vultures, and, the, dragon, which, must, have, known, that, they, were, monsters, collaborated, mysteriously, with, hercules, in, 1946, borges, published, the, short, story, deutsches, requiem, which, masquerades, as, the, last, testament, of, a, condemned, nazi, war, criminal, named, otto, dietrich, zur, linde, in, a, 1971, conference, at, columbia, university, borges, was, asked, about, the, story, by, a, student, from, the, creative, writing, program, he, recalled, when, the, germans, were, defeated, i, felt, great, joy, and, relief, but, at, the, same, time, i, thought, of, the, german, defeat, as, being, somehow, tragic, because, here, we, have, perhaps, the, most, educated, people, in, europe, who, have, a, fine, literature, a, fine, tradition, of, philosophy, and, poetry, yet, these, people, were, bamboozled, by, a, madman, named, adolf, hitler, and, i, think, there, is, tragedy, there, in, a, 1967, interview, with, burgin, borges, recalled, how, his, interactions, with, argentina, s, nazi, sympathisers, led, him, to, create, the, story, he, recalled, and, then, i, realized, that, those, people, that, were, on, the, side, of, germany, that, they, never, thought, of, german, victories, or, the, german, glory, what, they, really, liked, was, the, idea, of, the, blitzkrieg, of, london, being, on, fire, of, the, country, being, destroyed, as, to, the, german, fighters, they, took, no, stock, in, them, then, i, thought, well, now, germany, has, lost, now, america, has, saved, us, from, this, nightmare, but, since, nobody, can, doubt, on, which, side, i, stood, i, ll, see, what, can, be, done, from, a, literary, point, of, view, in, favor, of, the, nazis, and, then, i, created, the, ideal, nazi, at, columbia, university, in, 1971, borges, further, elaborated, on, the, story, s, creation, i, tried, to, imagine, what, a, real, nazi, might, be, like, i, mean, someone, who, thought, of, violence, as, being, praiseworthy, for, its, own, sake, then, i, thought, that, this, archetype, of, the, nazis, wouldn, t, mind, being, defeated, after, all, defeats, and, victories, are, mere, matters, of, chance, he, would, still, be, glad, of, the, fact, even, if, the, americans, and, british, won, the, war, naturally, when, i, am, with, nazis, i, find, they, are, not, my, idea, of, what, a, nazi, is, but, this, wasn, t, meant, to, be, a, political, tract, it, was, meant, to, stand, for, the, fact, that, there, was, something, tragic, in, the, fate, of, a, real, nazi, except, that, i, wonder, if, a, real, nazi, ever, existed, at, least, when, i, went, to, germany, i, never, met, one, they, were, all, feeling, sorry, for, themselves, and, wanted, me, to, feel, sorry, for, them, as, well, in, 1946, argentine, president, juan, per, n, began, transforming, argentina, into, a, one, party, state, with, the, assistance, of, his, wife, evita, almost, immediately, the, spoils, system, was, the, rule, of, the, day, as, ideological, critics, of, the, ruling, partido, justicialista, were, fired, from, government, jobs, during, this, period, borges, was, informed, that, he, was, being, promoted, from, his, position, at, the, miguel, can, library, to, a, post, as, inspector, of, poultry, and, rabbits, at, the, buenos, aires, municipal, market, upon, demanding, to, know, the, reason, borges, was, told, well, you, were, on, the, side, of, the, allies, what, do, you, expect, borges, resigned, the, following, day, per, n, s, treatment, of, borges, became, a, cause, c, l, bre, for, the, argentine, intelligentsia, the, argentine, society, of, writers, sade, held, a, formal, dinner, in, his, honour, at, the, dinner, a, speech, was, read, which, borges, had, written, for, the, occasion, it, said, dictatorships, breed, oppression, dictatorships, breed, servility, dictatorships, breed, cruelty, more, loathsome, still, is, the, fact, that, they, breed, idiocy, bellboys, babbling, orders, portraits, of, caudillos, prearranged, cheers, or, insults, walls, covered, with, names, unanimous, ceremonies, mere, discipline, usurping, the, place, of, clear, thinking, fighting, these, sad, monotonies, is, one, of, the, duties, of, a, writer, need, i, remind, readers, of, mart, n, fierro, or, don, segundo, that, individualism, is, an, old, argentine, virtue, in, the, aftermath, borges, found, himself, much, in, demand, as, a, lecturer, and, one, of, the, intellectual, leaders, of, the, argentine, opposition, in, 1951, he, was, asked, by, anti, peronist, friends, to, run, for, president, of, sade, borges, then, having, depression, caused, by, a, failed, romance, reluctantly, accepted, he, later, recalled, that, he, would, awake, every, morning, and, remember, that, per, n, was, president, and, feel, deeply, depressed, and, ashamed, per, n, s, government, had, seized, control, of, the, argentine, mass, media, and, regarded, sade, with, indifference, borges, later, recalled, however, many, distinguished, men, of, letters, did, not, dare, set, foot, inside, its, doors, meanwhile, sade, became, an, increasing, refuge, for, critics, of, the, per, n, government, sade, official, luisa, mercedes, levinson, noted, we, would, gather, every, week, to, tell, the, latest, jokes, about, the, ruling, couple, and, even, dared, to, sing, the, songs, of, the, french, resistance, as, well, as, la, marseillaise, after, evita, per, n, s, death, on, 26, july, 1952, borges, received, a, visit, from, two, policemen, who, ordered, him, to, put, up, two, portraits, of, the, ruling, couple, on, the, premises, of, sade, borges, indignantly, refused, calling, it, a, ridiculous, demand, the, policemen, replied, that, he, would, soon, face, the, consequences, the, justicialist, party, placed, borges, under, 24, hour, surveillance, and, sent, policemen, to, sit, in, on, his, lectures, in, september, they, ordered, sade, to, be, permanently, closed, down, like, much, of, the, argentine, opposition, to, per, n, sade, had, become, marginalized, due, to, persecution, by, the, state, and, very, few, active, members, remained, according, to, edwin, williamson, borges, had, agreed, to, stand, for, the, presidency, of, the, sade, in, order, fight, for, intellectual, freedom, but, he, also, wanted, to, avenge, the, humiliation, he, believed, he, had, suffered, in, 1946, when, the, peronists, had, proposed, to, make, him, an, inspector, of, chickens, in, his, letter, of, 1950, to, attilio, rossi, he, claimed, that, his, infamous, promotion, had, been, a, clever, way, the, peronists, had, found, of, damaging, him, and, diminishing, his, reputation, the, closure, of, the, sade, meant, that, the, peronists, had, damaged, him, a, second, time, as, was, borne, out, by, the, visit, of, the, spanish, writer, juli, n, mar, as, who, arrived, in, buenos, aires, shortly, after, the, closure, of, the, sade, it, was, impossible, for, borges, as, president, to, hold, the, usual, reception, for, the, distinguished, visitor, instead, one, of, borges, s, friends, brought, a, lamb, from, his, ranch, and, they, had, it, roasted, at, a, tavern, across, the, road, from, the, sade, building, on, calle, mexico, after, dinner, a, friendly, janitor, let, them, into, the, premises, and, they, showed, mar, as, around, by, candlelight, that, tiny, group, of, writers, leading, a, foreign, guest, through, a, dark, building, by, the, light, of, guttering, candles, was, vivid, proof, of, the, extent, to, which, the, sade, had, been, diminished, under, the, rule, of, juan, per, n, on, 16, september, 1955, general, pedro, eugenio, aramburu, s, revoluci, n, libertadora, toppled, the, ruling, party, and, forced, per, n, into, exile, borges, was, overjoyed, and, joined, demonstrators, marching, through, the, streets, of, buenos, aires, according, to, williamson, borges, shouted, viva, la, patria, until, his, voice, grew, hoarse, due, to, the, influence, of, borges, s, mother, and, his, own, role, on, the, opposition, to, peron, the, provisional, government, appointed, borges, as, the, director, of, the, national, library, in, his, essay, l, illusion, comique, borges, wrote, there, were, two, histories, of, peronism, in, argentina, the, first, he, described, as, the, criminal, one, composed, of, the, police, state, tactics, used, against, both, real, and, imagined, anti, peronists, the, second, history, was, according, to, borges, the, theatrical, one, composed, of, tales, and, fables, made, for, consumption, by, dolts, he, argued, that, despite, their, claims, to, detest, capitalism, juan, and, eva, per, n, copied, its, methods, dictating, names, and, slogans, to, the, people, in, the, same, way, that, multi, national, corporations, impose, their, razor, blades, cigarettes, and, washing, machines, borges, then, listed, the, numerous, conspiracy, theories, the, ruling, couple, dictated, to, their, followers, and, how, those, theories, were, accepted, without, question, borges, concluded, it, is, useless, to, list, the, examples, one, can, only, denounce, the, duplicity, of, the, fictions, of, the, former, regime, which, can, t, be, believed, and, were, believed, it, will, be, said, that, the, public, s, lack, of, sophistication, is, enough, to, explain, the, contradiction, i, believe, that, the, cause, is, more, profound, coleridge, spoke, of, the, willing, suspension, of, disbelief, that, is, poetic, faith, samuel, johnson, said, in, defense, of, shakespeare, that, the, spectators, at, a, tragedy, do, not, believe, they, are, in, alexandria, in, the, first, act, and, rome, in, the, second, but, submit, to, the, pleasure, of, a, fiction, similarly, the, lies, of, a, dictatorship, are, neither, believed, nor, disbelieved, they, pertain, to, an, intermediate, plane, and, their, purpose, is, to, conceal, or, justify, sordid, or, atrocious, realities, they, pertain, to, the, pathetic, or, the, clumsily, sentimental, happily, for, the, enlightenment, and, security, of, the, argentines, the, current, regime, has, understood, that, the, function, of, government, is, not, to, inspire, pathos, in, a, 1967, interview, borges, said, per, n, was, a, humbug, and, he, knew, it, and, everybody, knew, it, but, per, n, could, be, very, cruel, i, mean, he, had, people, tortured, killed, and, his, wife, was, a, common, prostitute, when, per, n, returned, from, exile, in, 1973, and, regained, the, presidency, borges, was, enraged, in, a, 1975, interview, for, national, geographic, he, said, damn, the, snobs, are, back, in, the, saddle, if, their, posters, and, slogans, again, defile, the, city, i, ll, be, glad, i, ve, lost, my, sight, well, they, can, t, humiliate, me, as, they, did, before, my, books, sold, well, after, being, accused, of, being, unforgiving, borges, quipped, i, resented, per, n, s, making, argentina, look, ridiculous, to, the, world, as, in, 1951, when, he, announced, control, over, thermonuclear, fusion, which, still, hasn, t, happened, anywhere, but, in, the, sun, and, the, stars, for, a, time, argentines, hesitated, to, wear, band, aids, for, fear, friends, would, ask, did, the, atomic, bomb, go, off, in, your, hand, a, shame, because, argentina, really, has, world, class, scientists, after, borges, s, death, in, 1986, the, peronist, partido, justicialista, declined, to, send, a, delegate, to, the, writer, s, memorial, service, in, buenos, aires, a, spokesman, for, the, party, said, that, this, was, in, reaction, to, certain, declarations, he, had, made, about, the, country, later, at, the, city, council, of, buenos, aires, peronist, politicians, refused, to, honor, borges, as, an, argentine, commenting, that, he, chose, to, die, abroad, when, infuriated, politicians, from, the, other, parties, demanded, to, know, the, real, reason, the, peronists, finally, explained, that, borges, had, made, statements, about, evita, per, n, which, they, called, unacceptable, during, the, 1970s, borges, at, first, expressed, support, for, argentina, s, military, junta, but, was, scandalized, by, the, junta, s, actions, during, the, dirty, war, in, protest, against, their, support, of, the, regime, borges, ceased, publishing, in, the, newspaper, la, naci, n, in, 1985, he, wrote, a, short, poem, about, the, falklands, war, called, juan, l, pez, y, john, ward, about, two, fictional, soldiers, one, from, each, side, who, died, in, the, falklands, in, which, he, refers, to, islands, that, were, too, famous, he, also, said, about, the, war, the, falklands, thing, was, a, fight, between, two, bald, men, over, a, comb, borges, was, an, observer, at, the, trials, of, the, military, junta, in, 1985, and, wrote, that, not, to, judge, and, condemn, the, crimes, would, be, to, encourage, impunity, and, to, become, somehow, its, accomplice, borges, added, that, the, news, of, the, missing, people, the, crimes, and, atrocities, committed, had, inspired, him, to, return, to, his, earlier, emersonian, faith, in, democracy, borges, believed, that, indigenous, peoples, in, what, is, now, called, argentina, had, no, traditions, there, s, no, native, tradition, of, any, kind, since, the, indians, here, were, mere, barbarians, we, have, to, fall, back, on, the, european, tradition, why, not, it, s, a, very, fine, tradition, wardrip, fruin, and, montfort, argue, that, borges, may, have, been, the, most, important, figure, in, spanish, language, literature, since, cervantes, he, was, clearly, of, tremendous, influence, writing, intricate, poems, short, stories, and, essays, that, instantiated, concepts, of, dizzying, power, borges, s, work, has, been, compared, to, that, of, homer, and, milton, indeed, the, critic, harold, bloom, numbers, borges, among, the, key, figures, of, the, western, literary, canon, in, addition, to, short, stories, for, which, he, is, most, noted, borges, also, wrote, poetry, essays, screenplays, literary, criticism, and, edited, numerous, anthologies, his, longest, work, of, fiction, is, a, fourteen, page, story, the, congress, first, published, in, 1971, his, late, onset, blindness, strongly, influenced, his, later, writing, borges, wrote, when, i, think, of, what, i, ve, lost, i, ask, who, know, themselves, better, than, the, blind, for, every, thought, becomes, a, tool, paramount, among, his, intellectual, interests, are, elements, of, mythology, mathematics, theology, integrating, these, through, literature, sometimes, playfully, sometimes, with, great, seriousness, borges, composed, poetry, throughout, his, life, as, his, eyesight, waned, it, came, and, went, with, a, struggle, between, advancing, age, and, advances, in, eye, surgery, he, increasingly, focused, on, writing, poetry, since, he, could, memorize, an, entire, work, in, progress, his, poems, embrace, the, same, wide, range, of, interests, as, his, fiction, along, with, issues, that, emerge, in, his, critical, works, and, translations, and, from, more, personal, musings, for, example, his, interest, in, idealism, runs, through, his, work, reflected, in, the, fictional, world, of, tl, n, in, tl, n, uqbar, orbis, tertius, and, in, his, essay, a, new, refutation, of, time, borges, was, a, notable, translator, he, translated, works, of, literature, in, english, french, german, old, english, and, old, norse, into, spanish, his, first, publication, for, a, buenos, aires, newspaper, was, a, translation, of, oscar, wilde, s, story, the, happy, prince, into, spanish, when, he, was, nine, at, the, end, of, his, life, he, produced, a, spanish, language, version, of, a, part, of, snorri, sturluson, s, prose, edda, he, also, translated, while, simultaneously, subtly, transforming, the, works, of, among, others, ambrose, bierce, william, faulkner, andr, gide, hermann, hesse, franz, kafka, rudyard, kipling, edgar, allan, poe, walt, whitman, and, virginia, woolf, borges, wrote, and, lectured, extensively, on, the, art, of, translation, holding, that, a, translation, may, improve, upon, the, original, may, even, be, unfaithful, to, it, and, that, alternative, and, potentially, contradictory, renderings, of, the, same, work, can, be, equally, valid, borges, employed, the, devices, of, literary, forgery, and, the, review, of, an, imaginary, work, both, forms, of, modern, pseudo, epigrapha, borge, s, recorded, work, includes, readings, of, his, poems, a, collaboration, with, argentine, composer, astor, piazzolla, and, a,

works, he, had, chanced, upon, in, another, case, he, added, three, short, falsely, attributed, pieces, into, his, otherwise, legitimate, and, carefully, researched, anthology, el, matrero, several, of, these, are, gathered, in, a, universal, history, of, infamy, while, borges, was, the, great, popularizer, of, the, review, of, an, imaginary, work, he, had, developed, the, idea, from, thomas, carlyle, s, sartor, resartus, a, book, length, review, of, a, non, existent, german, transcendentalist, work, and, the, biography, of, its, equally, non, existent, author, in, this, craft, of, verse, borges, says, that, in, 1916, in, geneva, discovered, and, was, overwhelmed, by, thomas, carlyle, i, read, sartor, resartus, and, i, can, recall, many, of, its, pages, i, know, them, by, heart, in, the, introduction, to, his, first, published, volume, of, fiction, the, garden, of, forking, paths, borges, remarks, it, is, a, laborious, madness, and, an, impoverishing, one, the, madness, of, composing, vast, books, setting, out, in, five, hundred, pages, an, idea, that, can, be, perfectly, related, orally, in, five, minutes, the, better, way, to, go, about, it, is, to, pretend, that,

works, suffer, under, the, imperfection, that, they, themselves, are, books, and, not, a, whit, less, tautological, than, the, others, a, more, reasonable, more, inept, and, more, lazy, man, i, have, chosen, to, write, notes, on, imaginary, books, on, the, other, hand, some, works, were, wrongly, attributed, to, borges, like, the, poem, instantes, borges, s, change, in, style, from, regionalist, criollismo, to, a, more, cosmopolitan, style, brought, him, much, criticism, from, journals, such, as, contorno, a, leftist, sartre, influenced, argentine, publication, founded, by, david, vi, as, and, his, brother, along, with, other, intellectuals, such, as, no, jitrik, and, adolfo, prieto, in, the, post, peronist, argentina, of, the, early, 1960s, contorno, met, with, wide, approval, from, the, youth, who, challenged, the, authenticity, of, older, writers, such, as, borges, and, questioned, their, legacy, of, experimentation, magic, realism, and, exploration, of, universal, truths, they, argued, had, come, at, the, cost, of, responsibility, and, seriousness, in, the, face, of, society, s, problems, the, contorno, writers, acknowledged, borges, and, eduardo, mallea, for, being, doctors, of, technique, but, argued, that, their, work, lacked, substance, due, to, their, lack, of, interaction, with, the, reality, that, they, inhabited, an, existentialist, critique, of, their, refusal, to, embrace, existence, and, reality, in, their, artwork, the, story, the, sect, of, the, phoenix, is, famously, interpreted, to, allude, to, the, ubiquity, of, sexual, intercourse, among, humans, a, concept, whose, essential, qualities, the, narrator, of, the, story, is, not, able, to, relate, to, with, a, few, notable, exceptions, women, are, almost, entirely, absent, from, borges, s, fiction, however, there, are, some, instances, in, borges, s, later, writings, of, romantic, love, for, example, the, story, ulrikke, from, the, book, of, sand, the, protagonist, of, the, story, el, muerto, also, lusts, after, the, splendid, contemptuous, red, haired, woman, of, azevedo, bandeira, 197, and, later, sleeps, with, the, woman, with, shining, hair, 200, although, they, do, not, appear, in, the, stories, women, are, significantly, discussed, as, objects, of, unrequited, love, in, his, short, stories, the, zahir, and, the, aleph, the, plot, of, la, intrusa, was, based, on, a, true, story, of, two, friends, borges, turned, their, fictional, counterparts, into, brothers, excluding, the, possibility, of, a, homosexual, relationship, emma, zunz, is, a, story, with, an, eminent, female, protagonist, originally, published, in, 1948, this, work, tells, the, tale, of, a, young, jewish, woman, who, kills, a, man, in, order, to, avenge, the, disgrace, and, suicide, of, her, father, she, carefully, plans, the, crime, submitting, to, an, unpleasant, sexual, encounter, with, a, stranger, in, order, to, create, the, appearance, of, sexual, impropriety, in, her, intended, victim, despite, the, fact, that, she, premeditates, and, executes, a, murder, the, eponymous, heroine, of, this, story, is, surprisingly, likable, both, because, of, intrinsic, qualities, in, the, character, interestingly, enough, she, believes, in, nonviolence, and, because, the, story, is, narrated, from, a, remote, but, sympathetic, point, of, view, that, highlights, the, poignancy, of, her, situation, borges, was, never, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, something, which, continually, distressed, the, writer, he, was, one, of, several, distinguished, authors, who, never, received, the, honour, borges, commented, not, granting, me, the, nobel, prize, has, become, a, scandinavian, tradition, since, i, was, born, they, have, not, been, granting, it, to, me, some, observers, speculated, that, borges, did, not, receive, the, award, in, his, later, life, because, of, his, conservative, political, views, or, more, specifically, because, he, had, accepted, an, honour, from, chilean, dictator, augusto, pinochet, borges, was, among, the, short, listed, candidates, several, times, in, 1965, he, was, considered, along, with, vladimir, nabokov, pablo, neruda, and, mikhail, sholokhov, and, in, 1966, a, shared, prize, to, borges, and, miguel, ngel, asturias, was, proposed, borges, was, nominated, again, in, 1967, and, was, among, the, final, three, choices, considered, by, the, committee, according, to, nobel, records, unsealed, on, the, 50th, anniversary, in, 2017, the, committee, considered, borges, graham, greene, and, miguel, ngel, asturias, choosing, asturias, as, the, winner, many, of, borges, s, best, known, stories, deal, with, themes, of, time, the, secret, miracle, infinity, the, aleph, mirrors, tl, n, uqbar, orbis, tertius, and, labyrinths, the, two, kings, and, the, two, labyrinths, the, house, of, asterion, the, immortal, and, the, garden, of, forking, paths, williamson, writes, his, basic, contention, was, that, fiction, did, not, depend, on, the, illusion, of, reality, what, mattered, ultimately, was, an, author, s, ability, to, generate, poetic, faith, in, his, reader, his, stories, often, have, fantastical, themes, such, as, a, library, containing, every, possible, 410, page, text, the, library, of, babel, a, man, who, forgets, nothing, he, experiences, funes, the, memorious, an, artifact, through, which, the, user, can, see, everything, in, the, universe, the, aleph, and, a, year, of, still, time, given, to, a, man, standing, before, a, firing, squad, the, secret, miracle, borges, told, realistic, stories, of, south, american, life, of, folk, heroes, streetfighters, soldiers, gauchos, detectives, and, historical, figures, he, mixed, the, real, and, the, fantastic, fact, with, fiction, his, interest, in, compounding, fantasy, philosophy, and, the, art, of, translation, are, evident, in, articles, such, as, the, translators, of, the, book, of, one, thousand, and, one, nights, in, the, book, of, imaginary, beings, a, thoroughly, researched, bestiary, of, mythical, creatures, borges, wrote, there, is, a, kind, of, lazy, pleasure, in, useless, and, out, of, the, way, erudition, borges, s, interest, in, fantasy, was, shared, by, bioy, casares, with, whom, he, coauthored, several, collections, of, tales, between, 1942, and, 1967, often, especially, early, in, his, career, the, mixture, of, fact, and, fantasy, crossed, the, line, into, the, realm, of, hoax, or, literary, forgery, the, garden, of, forking, paths, 1941, presents, the, idea, of, forking, paths, through, networks, of, time, none, of, which, is, the, same, all, of, which, are, equal, borges, uses, the, recurring, image, of, a, labyrinth, that, folds, back, upon, itself, in, infinite, regression, so, we, become, aware, of, all, the, possible, choices, we, might, make, the, forking, paths, have, branches, to, represent, these, choices, that, ultimately, lead, to, different, endings, borges, saw, man, s, search, for, meaning, in, a, seemingly, infinite, universe, as, fruitless, and, instead, uses, the, maze, as, a, riddle, for, time, not, space, he, examined, the, themes, of, universal, randomness, the, lottery, in, babylon, and, madness, the, zahir, due, to, the, success, of, the, forking, paths, story, the, term, borgesian, came, to, reflect, a, quality, of, narrative, non, linearity, john, clute, writes, as, was, earlier, the, case, with, franz, kafka, a, collection, of, whose, work, he, translated, as, la, metamorfosis, coll, 1938, borges, s, influence, on, twentieth, century, literature, worldwide, has, been, so, deep, and, pervasive, that, any, sf, written, in, english, since, about, 1960, may, consciously, or, subliminally, reflect, his, work, any, sf, story, whose, structure, or, arguments, question, or, play, with, the, nature, of, reality, or, which, makes, fantastic, use, of, images, of, the, labyrinth, the, mirror, the, library, the, map, and, or, the, book, and, or, the, dream, to, inform, the, world, will, necessarily, navigate, seas, of, imagination, he, has, already, plumbed, apodictically, in, ten, or, twenty, short, stories, clute, notes, that, borges, revealed, a, first, hand, if, at, points, inaccurate, knowledge, of, sf, and, its, authors, including, h, p, lovecraft, robert, a, heinlein, a, e, van, vogt, and, ray, bradbury, and, cites, philip, k, dick, thomas, pynchon, kurt, vonnegut, and, gene, wolfe, as, being, directly, influenced, by, borges, william, gibson, recalls, the, sensation, both, complex, and, eerily, simple, of, reading, tl, n, uqbar, orbis, tertius, in, labyrinths, as, a, young, man, seated, at, a, writing, desk, said, to, have, belonged, to, francis, marion, had, the, concept, of, software, been, available, to, me, i, imagine, i, would, have, felt, as, though, i, were, installing, something, that, exponentially, increased, what, one, day, would, be, called, bandwidth, though, bandwidth, of, what, exactly, i, remain, unable, to, say, this, sublime, and, cosmically, comic, fable, of, utterly, pure, information, i, e, the, utterly, fictive, gradually, and, relentlessly, infiltrating, and, eventually, consuming, the, quotidian, opened, something, within, me, which, has, never, yet, closed, works, we, all, our, lives, recall, reading, for, the, first, time, are, among, the, truest, milestones, but, labyrinths, was, a, profoundly, singular, one, for, me, and, i, believe, i, knew, that, then, in, my, early, adolescence, it, was, demonstrated, to, me, that, afternoon, proven, for, by, the, time, i, had, finished, with, tl, n, though, one, never, finishes, with, tl, n, nor, indeed, any, story, by, borges, and, had, traversed, the, garden, of, forking, paths, and, had, wondered, literally, bug, eyed, at, pierre, menaud, author, of, the, quixote, i, discovered, that, i, had, ceased, to, be, afraid, of, any, influence, that, might, dwell, within, francis, marion, s, towering, desk, the, philosophical, term, borgesian, conundrum, is, named, after, him, and, has, been, defined, as, the, ontological, question, of, whether, the, writer, writes, the, story, or, it, writes, him, the, original, concept, was, put, forward, by, borges, in, his, essay, kafka, and, his, precursors, after, reviewing, works, that, were, written, before, those, of, kafka, borges, wrote, if, i, am, not, mistaken, the, heterogeneous, pieces, i, have, enumerated, resemble, kafka, if, i, am, not, mistaken, not, all, of, them, resemble, each, other, the, second, fact, is, the, more, significant, in, each, of, these, texts, we, find, kafka, s, idiosyncrasy, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, but, if, kafka, had, never, written, a, line, we, would, not, perceive, this, quality, in, other, words, it, would, not, exist, the, poem, fears, and, scruples, by, browning, foretells, kafka, s, work, but, our, reading, of, kafka, perceptibly, sharpens, and, deflects, our, reading, of, the, poem, browning, did, not, read, it, as, we, do, now, in, the, critics, vocabulary, the, word, precursor, is, indispensable, but, it, should, be, cleansed, of, all, connotation, of, polemics, or, rivalry, the, fact, is, that, every, writer, creates, his, own, precursors, his, work, modifies, our, conception, of, the, past, as, it, will, modify, the, future, along, with, other, young, argentine, writers, of, his, generation, borges, initially, rallied, around, the, fictional, character, of, mart, n, fierro, mart, n, fierro, a, poem, by, jos, hern, ndez, was, a, dominant, work, of, 19th, century, argentine, literature, its, eponymous, hero, became, a, symbol, of, argentine, sensibility, untied, from, european, values, a, gaucho, free, poor, pampas, dwelling, the, character, fierro, is, illegally, drafted, to, serve, at, a, border, fort, to, defend, it, against, the, indigenous, population, but, ultimately, deserts, to, become, a, gaucho, matrero, the, argentine, equivalent, of, a, north, american, western, outlaw, borges, contributed, keenly, to, the, avant, garde, mart, n, fierro, magazine, in, the, early, 1920s, as, borges, matured, he, came, to, a, more, nuanced, attitude, toward, the, hern, ndez, poem, in, his, book, of, essays, on, the, poem, borges, separates, his, admiration, for, the, aesthetic, virtues, of, the, work, from, his, mixed, opinion, of, the, moral, virtues, of, its, protagonist, in, his, essay, the, argentine, writer, and, tradition, 1951, borges, celebrates, how, hern, ndez, expresses, the, argentine, character, in, a, key, scene, in, the, poem, mart, n, fierro, and, el, moreno, compete, by, improvising, songs, on, universal, themes, such, as, time, night, and, the, sea, reflecting, the, real, world, gaucho, tradition, of, payadas, improvised, musical, dialogues, on, philosophical, themes, borges, points, out, that, hern, ndez, evidently, knew, the, difference, between, actual, gaucho, tradition, of, composing, poetry, versus, the, gauchesque, fashion, among, buenos, aires, literati, in, his, works, he, refutes, the, arch, nationalist, interpreters, of, the, poem, and, disdains, others, such, as, critic, eleuterio, tiscornia, for, their, europeanising, approach, borges, denies, that, argentine, literature, should, distinguish, itself, by, limiting, itself, to, local, colour, which, he, equates, with, cultural, nationalism, racine, and, shakespeare, s, work, he, says, looked, beyond, their, countries, borders, neither, he, argues, need, the, literature, be, bound, to, the, heritage, of, old, world, spanish, or, european, tradition, nor, should, it, define, itself, by, the, conscious, rejection, of, its, colonial, past, he, asserts, that, argentine, writers, need, to, be, free, to, define, argentine, literature, anew, writing, about, argentina, and, the, world, from, the, point, of, view, of, those, who, have, inherited, the, whole, of, world, literature, williamson, says, borges, s, main, argument, is, that, the, very, fact, of, writing, from, the, margins, provides, argentine, writers, with, a, special, opportunity, to, innovate, without, being, bound, to, the, canons, of, the, centre, at, once, a, part, of, and, apart, from, the, centre, which, gives, them, much, potential, freedom, borges, focused, on, universal, themes, but, also, composed, a, substantial, body, of, literature, on, themes, from, argentine, folklore, and, history, his, first, book, the, poetry, collection, fervor, de, buenos, aires, passion, for, buenos, aires, appeared, in, 1923, borges, s, writings, on, things, argentine, include, argentine, culture, history, of, the, tango, inscriptions, on, horse, wagons, folklore, juan, mura, a, night, of, the, gifts, literature, the, argentine, writer, and, tradition, almafuerte, evaristo, carriego, and, national, concerns, celebration, of, the, monster, hurry, hurry, the, mountebank, pedro, salvadores, ultranationalists, however, continued, to, question, his, argentine, identity, borges, s, interest, in, argentine, themes, reflects, in, part, the, inspiration, of, his, family, tree, borges, had, an, english, paternal, grandmother, who, around, 1870, married, the, criollo, francisco, borges, a, man, with, a, military, command, and, a, historic, role, in, the, argentine, civil, wars, in, what, are, now, argentina, and, uruguay, spurred, by, pride, in, his, family, s, heritage, borges, often, used, those, civil, wars, as, settings, in, fiction, and, quasi, fiction, for, example, the, life, of, tadeo, isidoro, cruz, the, dead, man, avelino, arredondo, as, well, as, poetry, general, quiroga, rides, to, his, death, in, a, carriage, borges, s, maternal, great, grandfather, manuel, isidoro, su, rez, was, another, military, hero, whom, borges, immortalized, in, the, poem, a, page, to, commemorate, colonel, su, rez, victor, at, jun, n, his, nonfiction, explores, many, of, the, themes, found, in, his, fiction, essays, such, as, the, history, of, the, tango, or, his, writings, on, the, epic, poem, mart, n, fierro, explore, argentine, themes, such, as, the, identity, of, the, argentine, people, and, of, various, argentine, subcultures, the, varying, genealogies, of, characters, settings, and, themes, in, his, stories, such, as, la, muerte, y, la, br, jula, used, argentine, models, without, pandering, to, his, readers, or, framing, argentine, culture, as, exotic, in, fact, contrary, to, what, is, usually, supposed, the, geographies, found, in, his, fictions, often, do, not, correspond, to, those, of, real, world, argentina, in, his, essay, el, escritor, argentino, y, la, tradici, n, borges, notes, that, the, very, absence, of, camels, in, the, qur, an, was, proof, enough, that, it, was, an, arabian, work, despite, the, fact, that, camels, are, mentioned, in, the, qur, an, he, suggested, that, only, someone, trying, to, write, an, arab, work, would, purposefully, include, a, camel, he, uses, this, example, to, illustrate, how, his, dialogue, with, universal, existential, concerns, was, just, as, argentine, as, writing, about, gauchos, and, tangos, borges, detested, football, at, the, time, of, the, argentine, declaration, of, independence, in, 1816, the, population, was, predominantly, criollo, of, spanish, ancestry, from, the, mid, 1850s, on, waves, of, immigration, from, europe, especially, italy, and, spain, arrived, in, the, country, and, in, the, following, decades, the, argentine, national, identity, diversified, borges, was, writing, in, a, strongly, european, literary, context, immersed, in, spanish, english, french, german, italian, anglo, saxon, and, old, norse, literature, he, also, read, translations, of, near, eastern, and, far, eastern, works, borges, s, writing, is, also, informed, by, scholarship, of, christianity, buddhism, islam, and, judaism, including, prominent, religious, figures, heretics, and, mystics, religion, and, heresy, are, explored, in, such, stories, as, averroes, s, search, the, writing, of, the, god, the, theologians, and, three, versions, of, judas, the, curious, inversion, of, mainstream, christian, concepts, of, redemption, in, the, last, story, is, characteristic, of, borges, s, approach, to, theology, in, his, literature, in, describing, himself, borges, said, i, am, not, sure, that, i, exist, actually, i, am, all, the, writers, that, i, have, read, all, the, people, that, i, have, met, all, the, women, that, i, have, loved, all, the, cities, that, i, have, visited, all, my, ancestors, as, a, young, man, he, visited, the, frontier, pampas, which, extend, beyond, argentina, into, uruguay, and, brazil, borges, said, that, his, father, wished, him, to, become, a, citizen, of, the, world, a, great, cosmopolitan, in, the, way, of, henry, and, william, james, borges, lived, and, studied, in, switzerland, and, spain, as, a, young, student, as, borges, matured, he, traveled, through, argentina, as, a, lecturer, and, internationally, as, a, visiting, professor, he, continued, to, tour, the, world, as, he, grew, older, finally, settling, in, geneva, where, he, had, spent, some, of, his, youth, drawing, on, the, influence, of, many, times, and, places, borges, s, work, belittled, nationalism, and, racism, however, borges, also, scorned, his, own, basque, ancestry, and, criticised, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, america, because, he, believed, black, people, were, happier, remaining, uneducated, and, without, freedom, portraits, of, diverse, coexisting, cultures, characteristic, of, argentina, are, especially, pronounced, in, the, book, six, problems, for, don, isidoro, parodi, co, authored, with, bioy, casares, and, death, and, the, compass, borges, wrote, that, he, considered, mexican, writer, alfonso, reyes, to, be, the, best, prose, writer, in, the, spanish, language, of, any, time, borges, was, also, an, admirer, of, asian, culture, e, g, the, ancient, chinese, board, game, of, go, about, which, he, penned, some, verses, while, the, garden, of, forking, paths, had, a, strong, chinese, theme, borges, was, rooted, in, the, modernism, predominant, in, its, early, years, and, was, influenced, by, symbolism, like, vladimir, nabokov, and, james, joyce, he, combined, an, interest, in, his, native, culture, with, broader, perspectives, also, sharing, their, multilingualism, and, inventiveness, with, language, however, while, nabokov, and, joyce, tended, toward, progressively, larger, works, borges, remained, a, miniaturist, his, work, progressed, away, from, what, he, referred, to, as, the, baroque, his, later, style, is, far, more, transparent, and, naturalistic, than, his, earlier, works, borges, represented, the, humanist, view, of, media, that, stressed, the, social, aspect, of, art, driven, by, emotion, if, art, represented, the, tool, then, borges, was, more, interested, in, how, the, tool, could, be, used, to, relate, to, people, existentialism, saw, its, apogee, during, the, years, of, borges, s, greatest, artistic, production, it, has, been, argued, that, his, choice, of, topics, largely, ignored, existentialism, s, central, tenets, critic, paul, de, man, notes, whatever, borges, s, existential, anxieties, may, be, they, have, little, in, common, with, sartre, s, robustly, prosaic, view, of, literature, with, the, earnestness, of, camus, moralism, or, with, the, weighty, profundity, of, german, existential, thought, rather, they, are, the, consistent, expansion, of, a, purely, poetic, consciousness, to, its, furthest, limits, the, essay, collection, borges, y, la, matem, tica, borges, and, mathematics, 2003, by, argentine, mathematician, and, writer, guillermo, mart, nez, outlines, how, borges, used, concepts, from, mathematics, in, his, work, mart, nez, states, that, borges, had, for, example, at, least, a, superficial, knowledge, of, set, theory, which, he, handles, with, elegance, in, stories, such, as, the, book, of, sand, other, books, such, as, the, unimaginable, mathematics, of, borges, library, of, babel, by, william, goldbloom, bloch, 2008, and, unthinking, thinking, jorge, luis, borges, mathematics, and, the, new, physics, by, floyd, merrell, 1991, also, explore, this, relationship, fritz, mauthner, philosopher, of, language, and, author, of, the, w, rterbuch, der, philosophie, dictionary, of, philosophy, had, an, important, influence, on, borges, borges, always, recognized, the, influence, of, this, german, philosopher, according, to, the, literary, review, sur, the, book, was, one, of, the, five, books, most, noted, and, read, by, borges, the, first, time, that, borges, mentioned, mauthner, was, in, 1928, in, his, book, the, language, of, the, argentines, el, idioma, de, los, argentinos, in, a, 1962, interview, borges, described, mauthner, as, possessing, a, fine, sense, of, humor, as, well, as, great, knowledge, and, erudition, in, an, interview, denis, dutton, asked, borges, who, were, the, philosophers, who, have, influenced, your, works, in, whom, you, ve, been, the, most, interested, in, reply, borges, named, berkeley, and, schopenhauer, he, was, also, influenced, by, spinoza, about, whom, borges, wrote, a, famous, poem, it, is, not, without, humour, that, borges, once, wrote, siempre, imagin, que, el, para, so, ser, a, alg, n, tipo, de, biblioteca, i, always, imagined, paradise, to, be, some, kind, of, a, library
