holiday, commemorating, the, foundation, of, the, state, known, as, state, foundation, day, stephen, s, birth, date, is, uncertain, as, it, was, not, recorded, in, contemporaneous, documents, hungarian, and, polish, chronicles, written, centuries, later, give, three, different, years, 967, 969, and, 975, the, unanimous, testimony, of, his, three, late, 11th, century, or, early, 12th, century, hagiographies, and, other, hungarian, sources, which, state, that, stephen, was, still, an, adolescent, in, 997, substantiate, the, reliability, of, the, latest, year, 975, stephen, s, lesser, legend, adds, that, he, was, born, in, esztergom, which, implies, that, he, was, born, after, 972, because, his, father, g, za, grand, prince, of, the, hungarians, chose, esztergom, as, royal, residence, around, that, year, g, za, promoted, the, spread, of, christianity, among, his, subjects, by, force, but, never, ceased, worshipping, pagan, gods, both, his, son, s, greater, legend, and, the, nearly, contemporaneous, thietmar, of, merseburg, described, g, za, as, a, cruel, monarch, suggesting, that, he, was, a, despot, who, mercilessly, consolidated, his, authority, over, the, rebellious, hungarian, lords, hungarian, chronicles, agree, that, stephen, s, mother, was, sarolt, daughter, of, gyula, a, hungarian, chieftain, with, jurisdiction, either, in, transylvania, or, in, the, wider, region, of, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, tisza, and, maros, many, historians, including, p, l, engel, and, gyula, krist, propose, that, her, father, was, identical, with, gylas, who, had, been, baptized, in, constantinople, around, 952, and, remained, faithful, to, christianity, according, to, byzantine, chronicler, john, skylitzes, however, this, identification, is, not, unanimously, accepted, historian, gy, rgy, gy, rffy, states, that, it, was, not, sarolt, s, father, but, his, younger, brother, who, was, baptized, in, the, byzantine, capital, in, contrast, with, all, hungarian, sources, the, polish, hungarian, chronicle, and, later, polish, sources, state, that, stephen, s, mother, was, adelhaid, an, otherwise, unknown, sister, of, duke, mieszko, i, of, poland, but, the, reliability, of, this, report, is, not, accepted, by, modern, historians, stephen, was, born, as, vajk, a, name, derived, from, the, turkic, word, baj, meaning, hero, master, prince, or, rich, stephen, s, greater, legend, narrates, that, he, was, baptized, by, the, saintly, bishop, adalbert, of, prague, who, stayed, in, g, za, s, court, several, times, between, 983, and, 994, however, saint, adalbert, s, nearly, contemporaneous, legend, written, by, bruno, of, querfurt, does, not, mention, this, event, accordingly, the, date, of, stephen, s, baptism, is, unknown, gy, rffy, argues, that, he, was, baptized, soon, after, birth, while, krist, proposes, that, he, only, received, baptism, just, before, his, father, s, death, in, 997, stephen, s, official, hagiography, written, by, bishop, hartvic, and, sanctioned, by, pope, innocent, iii, narrates, that, he, was, fully, instructed, in, the, knowledge, of, the, grammatical, art, in, his, childhood, this, implies, that, he, studied, latin, though, some, scepticism, is, warranted, as, few, kings, of, this, era, were, able, to, write, his, two, other, late, 11th, century, hagiographies, do, not, mention, any, grammatical, studies, stating, only, that, he, was, brought, up, by, receiving, an, education, appropriate, for, a, little, prince, krist, says, that, the, latter, remark, only, refers, to, stephen, s, physical, training, including, his, participation, in, hunts, and, military, actions, according, to, the, illuminated, chronicle, one, of, his, tutors, was, a, count, deodatus, from, italy, who, later, founded, a, monastery, in, tata, according, to, stephen, s, legends, grand, prince, g, za, convoked, an, assembly, of, the, hungarian, chieftains, and, warriors, when, stephen, ascended, to, the, first, stage, of, adolescence, at, the, age, of, 14, or, 15, g, za, nominated, stephen, as, his, successor, and, all, those, present, took, an, oath, of, loyalty, to, the, young, prince, gy, rffy, writes, without, identifying, his, source, that, g, za, appointed, his, son, to, rule, the, nyitra, ducate, around, that, time, slovak, historians, including, j, n, steinh, bel, and, j, n, luka, ka, accept, gy, rffy, s, view, and, propose, that, stephen, administered, nyitra, now, nitra, slovakia, from, around, 995, g, za, arranged, stephen, s, marriage, to, gisela, daughter, of, henry, ii, duke, of, bavaria, in, or, after, 995, this, marriage, established, the, first, family, link, between, a, hungarian, ruler, and, a, western, european, ruling, house, as, gisela, was, closely, related, to, the, ottonian, dynasty, of, holy, roman, emperors, according, to, popular, tradition, preserved, in, the, scheyern, abbey, in, bavaria, the, ceremony, took, place, at, the, scheyern, castle, and, was, celebrated, by, saint, adalbert, gisela, was, accompanied, to, her, new, home, by, bavarian, knights, many, of, whom, received, land, grants, from, her, husband, and, settled, in, hungary, helping, to, strengthen, stephen, s, military, position, according, to, gy, rffy, stephen, and, his, wife, presumably, settled, in, nyitra, after, their, marriage, grand, prince, g, za, died, in, 997, stephen, convoked, an, assembly, at, esztergom, where, his, supporters, declared, him, grand, prince, initially, he, only, controlled, the, northwestern, regions, of, the, carpathian, basin, the, rest, of, the, territory, was, still, dominated, by, tribal, chieftains, stephen, s, ascension, to, the, throne, was, in, line, with, the, principle, of, primogeniture, which, prescribed, that, a, father, was, succeeded, by, his, son, on, the, other, hand, it, contradicted, the, traditional, idea, of, seniority, according, to, which, g, za, should, have, been, succeeded, by, the, most, senior, member, of, the, rp, d, dynasty, which, was, kopp, ny, at, that, time, kopp, ny, who, held, the, title, duke, of, somogy, had, for, many, years, administered, the, regions, of, transdanubia, south, of, lake, balaton, kopp, ny, proposed, to, g, za, s, widow, sarolt, in, accordance, with, the, pagan, custom, of, levirate, marriage, he, also, announced, his, claim, to, the, throne, although, it, is, not, impossible, that, kopp, ny, had, already, been, baptized, in, 972, most, of, his, supporters, were, pagans, opponents, of, the, christianity, represented, by, stephen, and, his, predominantly, german, retinue, a, charter, of, 1002, for, the, pannonhalma, archabbey, writes, of, a, war, between, the, germans, and, the, hungarians, when, referring, to, the, armed, conflicts, between, stephen, and, kopp, ny, even, so, gy, rffy, says, that, oszlar, alan, beseny, pecheneg, k, r, and, other, place, names, referring, to, ethnic, groups, or, hungarian, tribes, in, transdanubia, around, the, supposed, borders, of, kopp, ny, s, duchy, suggest, that, significant, auxiliary, units, and, groups, of, hungarian, warriors, who, had, been, settled, there, by, grand, prince, g, za, fought, in, stephen, s, army, krist, states, that, the, entire, conflict, between, stephen, and, kopp, ny, was, only, a, feud, between, two, members, of, the, rp, d, dynasty, with, no, effect, on, other, hungarian, tribal, leaders, kopp, ny, and, his, troops, invaded, the, northern, regions, of, transdanubia, took, many, of, stephen, s, forts, and, plundered, his, lands, stephen, who, according, to, the, illuminated, chronicle, was, for, the, first, time, girded, with, his, sword, placed, the, brothers, hont, and, p, zm, ny, at, the, head, of, his, own, guard, and, nominated, vecelin, to, lead, the, royal, army, the, last, was, a, german, knight, who, had, come, to, hungary, in, the, reign, of, g, za, hont, and, p, zm, ny, were, according, to, simon, of, k, za, s, gesta, hunnorum, et, hungarorum, and, the, illuminated, chronicle, knights, of, swabian, origin, who, settled, in, hungary, either, under, g, za, or, in, the, first, years, of, stephen, s, reign, on, the, other, hand, luka, ka, and, other, slovak, historians, say, that, hont, and, p, zm, ny, were, slovak, noblemen, who, had, joined, stephen, during, his, rule, in, nyitra, kopp, ny, was, besieging, veszpr, m, when, he, was, informed, of, the, arrival, of, stephen, s, army, in, the, ensuing, battle, stephen, won, a, decisive, victory, over, his, enemies, kopp, ny, was, killed, on, the, battlefield, his, body, was, quartered, and, its, parts, were, displayed, at, the, gates, of, the, forts, of, esztergom, gy, r, gyulafeh, rv, r, alba, iulia, romania, and, veszpr, m, in, order, to, threaten, all, of, those, who, were, conspiring, against, the, young, monarch, stephen, occupied, kopp, ny, s, duchy, and, granted, large, estates, to, his, own, partisans, he, also, prescribed, that, kopp, ny, s, former, subjects, were, to, pay, tithes, to, the, pannonhalma, archabbey, according, to, the, deed, of, the, foundation, of, this, monastery, which, has, been, preserved, in, a, manuscript, containing, interpolations, the, same, document, declares, that, there, were, no, other, bishoprics, and, monasteries, in, hungary, at, that, time, on, the, other, hand, the, nearly, contemporary, bishop, thietmar, of, merseburg, stated, that, stephen, established, bishoprics, in, his, kingdom, before, being, crowned, king, if, the, latter, report, is, valid, the, dioceses, of, veszpr, m, and, gy, r, are, the, most, probable, candidates, according, to, historian, g, bor, thoroczkay, by, ordering, the, display, of, one, part, of, kopp, ny, s, quartered, corpse, in, gyulafeh, rv, r, the, seat, of, his, maternal, uncle, gyula, the, younger, stephen, asserted, his, claim, to, rule, all, lands, dominated, by, hungarian, lords, he, also, decided, to, strengthen, his, international, status, by, adopting, the, title, of, king, however, the, exact, circumstances, of, his, coronation, and, its, political, consequences, are, subject, to, scholarly, debate, thietmar, of, merseburg, writes, that, stephen, received, the, crown, with, the, favour, and, urging, of, emperor, otto, iii, r, 996, 1002, implying, that, stephen, accepted, the, emperor, s, suzerainty, before, his, coronation, on, the, other, hand, all, of, stephen, s, legends, emphasize, that, he, received, his, crown, from, pope, sylvester, ii, r, 999, 1003, krist, and, other, historians, point, out, that, pope, sylvester, and, emperor, otto, were, close, allies, which, implies, that, both, reports, are, valid, stephen, received, the, crown, and, consecration, from, the, pope, but, not, without, the, emperor, s, consent, around, 75, years, after, the, coronation, pope, gregory, vii, r, 1075, 1085, who, claimed, suzerainty, over, hungary, declared, that, stephen, had, offered, and, devotedly, surrendered, hungary, to, saint, peter, that, is, to, the, holy, see, in, a, contrasting, report, stephen, s, greater, legend, states, that, the, king, offered, hungary, to, the, virgin, mary, modern, historians, including, p, l, engel, and, mikl, s, moln, r, write, that, stephen, always, asserted, his, sovereignty, and, never, accepted, papal, or, imperial, suzerainty, for, instance, none, of, his, charters, were, dated, according, to, the, years, of, the, reign, of, the, contemporary, emperors, which, would, have, been, the, case, if, he, had, been, their, vassal, furthermore, stephen, declared, in, the, preamble, to, his, first, book, of, laws, that, he, governed, his, realm, by, the, will, of, god, the, exact, date, of, stephen, s, coronation, is, unknown, according, to, later, hungarian, tradition, he, was, crowned, on, the, first, day, of, the, second, millennium, which, may, refer, either, to, 25, december, 1000, or, to, 1, january, 1001, details, of, stephen, s, coronation, preserved, in, his, greater, legend, suggest, that, the, ceremony, which, took, place, in, esztergom, or, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, followed, the, rite, of, the, coronation, of, the, german, kings, accordingly, stephen, was, anointed, with, consecrated, oil, during, the, ceremony, stephen, s, portrait, preserved, on, his, royal, cloak, from, 1031, shows, that, his, crown, like, the, holy, roman, emperor, s, diadem, was, a, hoop, crown, decorated, with, gemstones, besides, his, crown, stephen, regarded, a, spear, with, a, flag, as, an, important, symbol, of, his, sovereignty, for, instance, his, first, coins, bear, the, inscription, lancea, regis, the, king, s, spear, and, depict, an, arm, holding, a, spear, with, flag, according, to, the, contemporaneous, ad, mar, de, chabannes, a, spear, had, been, given, to, stephen, s, father, by, emperor, otto, iii, as, a, token, of, g, za, s, right, to, enjoy, the, most, freedom, in, the, possession, of, his, country, stephen, is, styled, in, various, ways, ungarorum, rex, king, of, the, hungarians, pannoniorum, rex, king, of, the, pannonians, or, hungarie, rex, king, of, hungary, in, his, charters, although, stephen, s, power, did, not, rely, on, his, coronation, the, ceremony, granted, him, the, internationally, accepted, legitimacy, of, a, christian, monarch, who, ruled, his, realm, by, the, grace, of, god, all, his, legends, testify, that, he, established, an, archbishopric, with, its, see, in, esztergom, shortly, after, his, coronation, this, act, ensured, that, the, church, in, hungary, became, independent, of, the, prelates, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, earliest, reference, to, an, archbishop, of, esztergom, named, domokos, has, been, preserved, in, the, deed, of, foundation, of, the, pannonhalma, archabbey, from, 1002, according, to, historian, g, bor, thoroczkay, stephen, also, established, the, diocese, of, kalocsa, in, 1001, stephen, invited, foreign, priests, to, hungary, to, evangelize, his, kingdom, associates, of, the, late, adalbert, of, prague, including, radla, and, astrik, arrived, in, hungary, in, the, first, years, of, his, reign, the, presence, of, an, unnamed, archbishop, of, the, hungarians, at, the, synod, of, 1007, of, frankfurt, and, the, consecration, of, an, altar, in, bamberg, in, 1012, by, archbishop, astrik, show, that, stephen, s, prelates, maintained, a, good, relationship, with, the, clergy, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, transformation, of, hungary, into, a, christian, state, was, one, of, stephen, s, principal, concerns, throughout, his, reign, although, the, hungarians, conversion, had, already, begun, in, his, father, s, reign, it, was, only, stephen, who, systematically, forced, his, subjects, to, give, up, their, pagan, rituals, his, legislative, activity, was, closely, connected, with, christianity, for, example, his, first, book, of, laws, from, the, first, years, of, his, reign, includes, several, provisions, prescribing, the, observance, of, feast, days, and, the, confession, before, death, his, other, laws, protected, property, rights, and, the, interests, of, widows, and, orphans, or, regulated, the, status, of, serfs, if, someone, has, such, a, hardened, heart, god, forbid, it, to, any, christian, that, he, does, not, want, to, confess, his, faults, according, to, the, counsel, of, a, priest, he, shall, lie, without, any, divine, service, and, alms, like, an, infidel, if, his, relatives, and, neighbors, fail, to, summon, the, priest, and, therefore, he, should, die, unconfessed, prayers, and, alms, should, be, offered, but, his, relatives, shall, wash, away, their, negligence, by, fasting, in, accordance, with, the, judgement, of, the, priests, those, who, die, a, sudden, death, shall, be, buried, with, all, ecclesiastical, honor, for, divine, judgment, is, hidden, from, us, and, unknown, many, hungarian, lords, refused, to, accept, stephen, s, suzerainty, even, after, his, coronation, the, new, king, first, turned, against, his, own, uncle, gyula, the, younger, whose, realm, was, most, wide, and, rich, according, to, the, illuminated, chronicle, stephen, invaded, transylvania, and, seized, gyula, and, his, family, around, 1002, or, in, 1003, the, contemporary, annals, of, hildesheim, adds, that, stephen, converted, his, uncle, s, country, to, the, christian, faith, by, force, after, its, conquest, accordingly, historians, date, the, establishment, of, the, diocese, of, transylvania, to, this, period, if, the, identification, proposed, by, krist, gy, rffy, and, other, hungarian, historians, of, gyula, with, one, prokui, who, was, stephen, s, uncle, according, to, thietmar, of, merseburg, is, valid, gyula, later, escaped, from, captivity, and, fled, to, boles, aw, i, the, brave, duke, of, poland, r, 992, 1025, territory, included, a, certain, burg, located, near, the, border, with, the, hungarians, its, guardian, was, lord, prokui, an, uncle, of, the, hungarian, king, both, in, the, past, and, more, recently, prokui, had, been, driven, from, his, lands, by, the, king, and, his, wife, had, been, taken, captive, when, he, was, unable, to, free, her, his, nephew, arranged, for, her, unconditional, release, even, though, he, was, prokui, s, enemy, i, have, never, heard, of, anyone, who, showed, such, restraint, towards, a, defeated, foe, because, of, this, god, repeatedly, granted, him, victory, not, only, in, the, burg, mentioned, above, but, in, others, as, well, about, a, hundred, years, later, the, chronicler, gallus, anonymus, also, made, mention, of, armed, conflicts, between, stephen, and, boleslav, stating, that, the, latter, defeated, the, hungarians, in, battle, and, made, himself, master, of, all, their, lands, as, far, as, the, danube, gy, rffy, says, that, the, chronicler, s, report, refers, to, the, occupation, of, the, valley, of, the, river, morava, a, tributary, of, the, danube, by, the, poles, in, the, 1010s, on, the, other, hand, the, polish, hungarian, chronicle, states, that, the, polish, duke, occupied, large, territories, north, of, the, danube, and, east, of, the, morava, as, far, as, esztergom, in, the, early, 11th, century, according, to, steinh, bel, the, latter, source, proves, that, a, significant, part, of, the, lands, that, now, form, slovakia, were, under, polish, rule, between, 1002, and, 1030, in, contrast, with, the, slovak, historian, gy, rffy, writes, that, this, late, chronicle, in, which, one, absurdity, follows, another, contradicts, all, facts, known, from, 11th, century, sources, the, illuminated, chronicle, narrates, that, stephen, led, his, army, against, kean, duke, of, the, bulgarians, and, slavs, whose, lands, are, by, their, natural, position, most, strongly, fortified, following, the, occupation, of, gyula, s, country, according, to, a, number, of, historians, including, zolt, n, lenkey, and, g, bor, thoroczkay, kean, was, the, head, of, a, small, state, located, in, the, southern, parts, of, transylvania, and, stephen, occupied, his, country, around, 1003, other, historians, including, gy, rffy, say, that, the, chronicle, s, report, preserved, the, memory, of, stephen, s, campaign, against, bulgaria, in, the, late, 1010s, likewise, the, identification, of, the, black, hungarians, who, were, mentioned, by, bruno, of, querfurt, and, ad, mar, de, chabannes, among, the, opponents, of, stephen, s, proselytizing, policy, is, uncertain, gy, rffy, locates, their, lands, to, the, east, of, the, river, tisza, while, thoroczkay, says, they, live, in, the, southern, parts, of, transdanubia, bruno, of, querfurt, s, report, of, the, black, hungarians, conversion, by, force, suggests, that, stephen, conquered, their, lands, at, the, latest, in, 1009, when, the, first, mission, of, saint, peter, a, papal, legate, cardinal, azo, arrived, in, hungary, the, latter, attended, the, meeting, in, gy, r, where, the, royal, charter, determining, the, borders, of, the, newly, established, bishopric, of, p, cs, was, issued, on, 23, august, 1009, the, diocese, of, eger, was, also, set, up, around, 1009, according, to, thoroczkay, it, is, very, probable, that, the, bishopric, s, establishment, was, connected, with, the, conversion, of, the, kabars, an, ethnic, group, of, khazar, origin, and, their, chieftain, the, head, of, the, kabars, who, was, either, samuel, aba, or, his, father, married, stephen, s, unnamed, younger, sister, on, this, occasion, the, aba, clan, was, the, most, powerful, among, the, native, families, who, joined, stephen, and, supported, him, in, his, efforts, to, establish, a, christian, monarchy, the, reports, by, anonymus, simon, of, k, za, and, other, hungarian, chroniclers, of, the, b, r, kal, n, cs, k, and, other, 13th, century, noble, families, descending, from, hungarian, chieftains, suggest, that, other, native, families, were, also, involved, in, the, process, stephen, set, up, a, territory, based, administrative, system, establishing, counties, each, county, headed, by, a, royal, official, known, as, a, count, or, isp, n, was, an, administrative, unit, organized, around, a, royal, fortress, most, fortresses, were, earthworks, in, this, period, but, the, castles, at, esztergom, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, and, veszpr, m, were, built, of, stone, forts, serving, as, county, seats, also, became, the, nuclei, of, church, organization, the, settlements, developing, around, them, where, markets, were, held, on, each, sunday, were, important, local, economic, centers, stephen, s, brother, in, law, henry, ii, became, king, of, germany, in, 1002, and, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1013, their, friendly, relationship, ensured, that, the, western, borders, of, hungary, experienced, a, period, of, peace, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 11th, century, even, when, henry, ii, s, discontented, brother, bruno, sought, refuge, in, hungary, in, 1004, stephen, preserved, the, peace, with, germany, and, negotiated, a, settlement, between, his, two, brothers, in, law, around, 1009, he, gave, his, younger, sister, in, marriage, to, otto, orseolo, doge, of, venice, r, 1008, 1026, a, close, ally, of, the, byzantine, emperor, basil, ii, r, 976, 1025, which, suggests, that, hungary, s, relationship, with, the, byzantine, empire, was, also, peaceful, on, the, other, hand, the, alliance, between, hungary, and, the, holy, roman, empire, brought, her, into, a, war, with, poland, lasting, from, around, 1014, until, 1018, the, poles, occupied, the, hungarian, posts, along, the, river, morava, gy, rffy, and, krist, write, that, a, pecheneg, incursion, into, transylvania, the, memory, of, which, has, been, preserved, in, stephen, s, legends, also, took, place, in, this, period, because, the, pechenegs, were, close, allies, of, the, polish, duke, s, brother, in, law, grand, prince, sviatopolk, i, of, kiev, r, 1015, 1019, poland, and, the, holy, roman, empire, concluded, the, peace, of, bautzen, in, january, 1018, later, in, the, same, year, 500, hungarian, horsemen, accompanied, boleslav, of, poland, to, kyiv, suggesting, that, hungary, had, been, included, in, the, peace, treaty, the, historian, ferenc, makk, says, that, the, peace, of, bautzen, obliged, boleslav, to, hand, over, all, the, territories, he, had, occupied, in, the, morava, valley, to, stephen, according, to, leodvin, the, first, known, bishop, of, bihar, r, c, 1050, c, 1060, stephen, allied, with, the, byzantines, and, led, a, military, expedition, to, assist, them, against, barbarians, in, the, balkan, peninsula, the, byzantine, and, hungarian, troops, jointly, took, cesaries, which, gy, rffy, identifies, as, the, present, day, town, of, ohrid, leodvin, s, report, suggests, that, stephen, joined, the, byzantines, in, the, war, ending, with, their, conquest, of, bulgaria, in, 1018, however, the, exact, date, of, his, expedition, is, uncertain, gy, rffy, argues, that, it, was, only, in, the, last, year, of, the, war, that, stephen, led, his, troops, against, the, bulgarians, bishop, leodvin, wrote, that, stephen, collected, relics, of, a, number, of, saints, in, cesaries, during, his, campaign, in, the, balkans, including, saint, george, and, saint, nicholas, he, donated, them, to, his, new, triple, naved, basilica, dedicated, to, the, holy, virgin, in, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, where, he, also, set, up, a, cathedral, chapter, and, his, new, capital, his, decision, was, influenced, by, the, opening, in, 1018, or, 1019, of, a, new, pilgrimage, route, that, bypassed, his, old, capital, esztergom, the, new, route, connected, western, europe, and, the, holy, land, through, hungary, stephen, often, met, the, pilgrims, contributing, to, the, spread, of, his, fame, throughout, europe, abbot, odilo, of, cluny, for, example, wrote, in, a, letter, to, stephen, that, those, who, have, returned, from, the, shrine, of, our, lord, testify, to, the, king, s, passion, towards, the, honour, of, our, divine, religion, stephen, also, established, four, hostels, for, pilgrims, in, constantinople, jerusalem, ravenna, and, rome, all, those, from, italy, and, gaul, who, wished, to, go, to, the, sepulchre, of, the, lord, at, jerusalem, abandoned, the, usual, route, which, was, by, sea, making, their, way, through, the, country, of, king, stephen, he, made, the, road, safe, for, everyone, welcomed, as, brothers, all, he, saw, and, gave, them, enormous, gifts, this, action, led, many, people, nobles, and, commoners, to, go, to, jerusalem, in, addition, to, pilgrims, merchants, often, used, the, safe, route, across, hungary, when, travelling, between, constantinople, and, western, europe, stephen, s, legends, refer, to, 60, wealthy, pechenegs, who, travelled, to, hungary, but, were, attacked, by, hungarian, border, guards, the, king, sentenced, his, soldiers, to, death, in, order, to, demonstrate, his, determination, to, preserve, internal, peace, regular, minting, of, coinage, began, in, hungary, in, the, 1020s, his, silver, dinars, bearing, the, inscriptions, stephanus, rex, king, stephen, and, regia, civitas, royal, city, were, popular, in, contemporary, europe, as, demonstrated, by, counterfeited, copies, unearthed, in, sweden, stephen, convinced, some, pilgrims, and, merchants, to, settle, in, hungary, gerard, a, benedictine, monk, who, arrived, in, hungary, from, the, republic, of, venice, between, 1020, and, 1026, initially, planned, to, continue, his, journey, to, the, holy, land, but, decided, to, stay, in, the, country, after, his, meeting, with, the, king, stephen, also, established, a, number, of, benedictine, monasteries, including, the, abbeys, at, p, csv, rad, zalav, r, and, bakonyb, l, in, this, period, the, long, life, of, saint, gerard, mentions, stephen, s, conflict, with, ajtony, a, chieftain, in, the, region, of, the, river, maros, many, historians, date, their, clash, to, the, end, of, the, 1020s, although, gy, rffy, and, other, scholars, put, it, at, least, a, decade, earlier, the, conflict, arose, when, ajtony, who, had, taken, his, power, from, the, greeks, according, to, saint, gerard, s, legend, levied, tax, on, the, salt, transported, to, stephen, on, the, river, the, king, sent, a, large, army, led, by, csan, d, against, ajtony, who, was, killed, in, battle, his, lands, were, transformed, into, a, hungarian, county, and, the, king, set, up, a, new, bishopric, at, csan, d, cenad, romania, ajtony, s, former, capital, which, was, renamed, after, the, commander, of, the, royal, army, according, to, the, annales, posonienses, the, venetian, gerard, was, consecrated, as, the, first, bishop, of, the, new, diocese, in, 1030, stephen, s, brother, in, law, emperor, henry, died, on, 13, july, 1024, he, was, succeeded, by, a, distant, relative, conrad, ii, r, 1024, 1039, who, adopted, an, offensive, foreign, policy, conrad, ii, expelled, doge, otto, orseolo, the, husband, of, stephen, s, sister, from, venice, in, 1026, he, also, persuaded, the, bavarians, to, proclaim, his, own, son, henry, as, their, duke, in, 1027, although, stephen, s, son, emeric, had, a, strong, claim, to, the, duchy, of, bavaria, through, his, mother, emperor, conrad, planned, a, marriage, alliance, with, the, byzantine, empire, and, dispatched, one, of, his, advisors, bishop, werner, of, strasbourg, to, constantinople, in, the, autumn, of, 1027, the, bishop, seemingly, travelled, as, a, pilgrim, but, stephen, who, had, been, informed, of, his, actual, purpose, refused, to, let, him, enter, into, his, country, conrad, ii, s, biographer, wipo, of, burgundy, narrated, that, the, bavarians, incited, skirmishes, along, the, common, borders, of, hungary, and, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1029, causing, a, rapid, deterioration, in, relations, between, the, two, countries, emperor, conrad, personally, led, his, armies, to, hungary, in, june, 1030, and, plundered, the, lands, west, of, the, river, r, ba, however, according, to, the, annals, of, niederalteich, the, emperor, suffering, from, consequences, of, the, scorched, earth, tactics, used, by, the, hungarian, army, returned, to, germany, without, an, army, and, without, achieving, anything, because, the, army, was, threatened, by, starvation, and, was, captured, by, the, hungarians, at, vienna, peace, was, restored, after, conrad, had, ceded, the, lands, between, the, rivers, lajta, and, fischa, to, hungary, in, the, summer, of, 1031, at, this, same, time, dissensions, arose, between, the, pannonian, nation, and, the, bavarians, through, the, fault, of, the, bavarians, and, as, a, result, king, of, hungary, made, many, incursions, and, raids, in, the, realm, of, the, norici, that, is, of, the, bavarians, disturbed, on, this, account, emperor, conrad, came, upon, the, hungarians, with, a, great, army, but, king, whose, forces, were, entirely, insufficient, to, meet, the, emperor, relied, solely, on, the, guardianship, of, the, lord, which, he, sought, with, prayers, and, fasts, proclaimed, through, his, whole, realm, since, the, emperor, was, not, able, to, enter, a, kingdom, so, fortified, with, rivers, and, forests, he, returned, after, he, had, sufficiently, avenged, his, injury, with, lootings, and, burnings, on, the, borders, of, the, kingdom, and, it, was, his, wish, at, a, more, opportune, time, to, complete, the, things, he, had, begun, his, son, king, henry, however, still, a, young, boy, entrusted, to, the, care, of, eigilbert, bishop, of, freising, received, a, legation, of, king, which, asked, for, peace, and, solely, with, the, counsel, of, the, princes, of, the, realm, and, without, his, father, s, knowledge, he, granted, the, favor, of, reconciliation, stephen, s, biographer, hartvic, narrates, that, the, king, whose, children, died, one, by, one, in, infancy, restrained, the, grief, over, their, death, by, the, solace, on, account, of, the, love, of, his, surviving, son, emeric, however, emeric, was, wounded, in, a, hunting, accident, and, died, in, 1031, after, the, death, of, his, son, the, elderly, king, could, never, fully, regain, his, former, health, according, to, the, illuminated, chronicle, krist, writes, that, the, picture, which, has, been, preserved, in, stephen, s, legends, of, the, king, keeping, the, vigils, and, washing, the, feet, of, paupers, is, connected, with, stephen, s, last, years, following, the, death, of, his, son, emeric, s, death, jeopardized, his, father, s, achievements, in, establishing, a, christian, state, because, stephen, s, cousin, vazul, who, had, the, strongest, claim, to, succeed, him, was, suspected, of, an, inclination, towards, paganism, according, to, the, annals, of, altaich, stephen, disregarded, his, cousin, s, claim, and, nominated, his, sister, s, son, the, venetian, peter, orseolo, as, his, heir, the, same, source, adds, that, vazul, was, captured, and, blinded, and, his, three, sons, levente, andrew, and, b, la, were, expelled, from, hungary, stephen, s, legends, refer, to, an, unsuccessful, attempt, upon, the, elderly, king, s, life, by, members, of, his, court, according, to, krist, the, legends, refer, to, a, plot, in, which, vazul, participated, and, his, mutilation, was, a, punishment, for, this, act, that, vazul, s, ears, were, filled, with, molten, lead, was, only, recorded, in, later, sources, including, the, illuminated, chronicle, in, the, view, of, some, historians, provisions, in, stephen, s, second, book, of, laws, on, the, conspiracy, against, the, king, and, the, kingdom, imply, that, the, book, was, promulgated, after, vazul, s, unsuccessful, plot, against, stephen, however, this, view, has, not, been, universally, accepted, gy, rffy, states, that, the, law, book, was, issued, not, after, 1031, but, around, 1009, likewise, the, authenticity, of, the, decree, on, tithes, is, debated, according, to, gy, rffy, it, was, issued, during, stephen, s, reign, but, berend, laszlovszky, and, szak, cs, argue, that, it, might, be, a, later, addition, stephen, died, on, 15, august, 1038, he, was, buried, in, the, basilica, of, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, his, reign, was, followed, by, a, long, period, of, civil, wars, pagan, uprisings, and, foreign, invasions, the, instability, ended, in, 1077, when, ladislaus, a, grandson, of, vazul, ascended, the, throne, stephen, married, gisela, a, daughter, of, duke, henry, the, wrangler, of, bavaria, who, was, a, nephew, of, otto, i, holy, roman, emperor, gisela, s, mother, was, gisela, of, burgundy, a, member, of, the, welf, dynasty, born, around, 985, gisela, was, younger, than, her, husband, whom, she, survived, she, left, hungary, in, 1045, and, died, as, abbess, of, the, niedernburg, abbey, in, passau, in, bavaria, around, 1060, although, the, illuminated, chronicle, states, that, stephen, begot, many, sons, only, two, of, them, otto, and, emeric, are, known, by, name, otto, who, was, named, after, otto, iii, seems, to, have, been, born, before, 1002, he, died, as, a, child, emeric, who, received, the, name, of, his, maternal, uncle, emperor, henry, ii, was, born, around, 1007, his, legend, from, the, early, 12th, century, describes, him, as, a, saintly, prince, who, preserved, his, chastity, even, during, his, marriage, according, to, gy, rffy, emeric, s, wife, was, a, kinswoman, of, the, byzantine, emperor, basil, ii, his, premature, death, led, to, the, series, of, conflicts, leading, to, vazul, s, blinding, and, civil, wars, be, obedient, to, me, my, son, you, are, a, child, descendant, of, rich, parents, living, among, soft, pillows, who, has, been, caressed, and, brought, up, in, all, kinds, of, comforts, you, have, had, a, part, neither, in, the, troubles, of, the, campaigns, nor, in, the, various, attacks, of, the, pagans, in, which, almost, my, whole, life, has, been, worn, away, the, following, family, tree, presents, stephen, s, ancestors, and, his, relatives, who, are, mentioned, in, the, article, a, khazar, pecheneg, or, volga, bulgarian, lady, gy, rffy, writes, that, she, may, have, been, a, member, of, the, bulgarian, cometopuli, dynasty, samuel, aba, might, have, been, the, son, of, stephen, s, sister, instead, of, her, husband, stephen, has, always, been, considered, one, of, the, most, important, statesmen, in, the, history, of, hungary, his, main, achievement, was, the, establishment, of, a, christian, state, that, ensured, that, the, hungarians, survived, in, the, carpathian, basin, in, contrast, to, the, huns, avars, and, other, peoples, who, had, previously, controlled, the, same, territory, as, bryan, cartledge, emphasizes, stephen, also, gave, his, kingdom, forty, years, of, relative, peace, and, sound, but, unspectacular, rule, his, successors, including, those, descended, from, vazul, were, eager, to, emphasize, their, devotion, to, stephen, s, achievements, although, vazul, s, son, andrew, i, of, hungary, secured, the, throne, due, to, a, pagan, uprising, he, prohibited, pagan, rites, and, declared, that, his, subjects, should, live, in, all, things, according, to, the, law, which, king, st, stephen, had, taught, them, according, to, the, 14th, century, illuminated, chronicle, in, medieval, hungary, communities, that, claimed, a, privileged, status, or, attempted, to, preserve, their, own, liberties, often, declared, that, the, origin, of, their, special, status, was, to, be, attributed, to, king, saint, stephen, an, example, is, a, 1347, letter, from, the, people, of, t, p, telling, the, king, about, their, grievances, against, the, pannonhalma, archabbey, and, stating, that, the, taxes, levied, upon, them, by, the, abbot, contradicted, the, liberty, granted, to, them, in, the, time, of, king, saint, stephen, stephen, s, cult, emerged, after, the, long, period, of, anarchy, characterizing, the, rule, of, his, immediate, successors, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, stephen, became, an, object, of, veneration, before, his, canonization, for, instance, the, first, member, of, the, royal, family, to, be, named, after, him, stephen, ii, was, born, in, the, early, 12th, century, stephen, s, canonization, was, initiated, by, vazul, s, grandson, king, ladislaus, i, of, hungary, who, had, consolidated, his, authority, by, capturing, and, imprisoning, his, cousin, solomon, according, to, bishop, hartvic, the, canonization, was, decreed, by, apostolic, letter, by, order, of, the, roman, see, suggesting, that, the, ceremony, was, permitted, by, pope, gregory, vii, the, ceremony, started, at, stephen, s, tomb, where, on, 15, august, 1083, masses, of, believers, began, three, days, of, fasting, and, praying, legend, tells, that, stephen, s, coffin, could, not, be, opened, until, king, ladislaus, held, solomon, in, captivity, at, visegr, d, the, opening, of, stephen, s, tomb, was, followed, by, the, occurrence, of, healing, miracles, according, to, stephen, s, legends, historian, krist, attributes, the, healings, either, to, mass, psychosis, or, deception, stephen, s, legends, also, say, that, his, balsam, scented, remains, were, elevated, from, the, coffin, which, was, filled, with, rose, colored, water, on, 20, august, on, the, same, day, stephen, s, son, emeric, and, the, bishop, of, csan, d, gerard, were, also, canonized, having, completed, the, office, of, vespers, the, third, day, everyone, expected, the, favors, of, divine, mercy, through, the, merit, of, the, blessed, man, suddenly, with, christ, visiting, his, masses, the, signs, of, miracles, poured, forth, from, heaven, throughout, the, whole, of, the, holy, house, their, multitude, which, that, night, were, too, many, to, count, brings, to, mind, the, answer, from, the, gospel, which, the, savior, of, the, world, confided, to, john, who, asked, through, messengers, whether, he, was, the, one, who, was, to, come, the, blind, see, the, lame, walk, the, deaf, hear, the, lepers, are, cleansed, the, crippled, are, set, straight, the, paralyzed, are, cured, stephen, s, first, legend, the, so, called, greater, legend, was, written, between, 1077, and, 1083, it, provided, an, idealized, portrait, of, the, king, one, who, dedicated, himself, and, his, kingdom, to, the, virgin, mary, however, stephen, s, lesser, legend, composed, around, 1100, under, king, coloman, emphasized, stephen, s, severity, a, third, legend, also, composed, during, king, coloman, s, reign, by, bishop, hartvic, was, based, on, the, two, existing, legends, sanctioned, in, 1201, by, pope, innocent, iii, hartvic, s, work, served, as, stephen, s, official, legend, g, bor, klaniczay, wrote, that, stephen, s, legends, opened, a, new, chapter, in, the, legends, of, holy, rulers, as, a, genre, suggesting, that, a, monarch, can, achieve, sainthood, through, actively, using, his, royal, powers, stephen, was, the, first, triumphant, miles, christi, christ, s, soldier, among, the, canonized, monarchs, he, was, also, a, confessor, king, one, who, had, not, suffered, martyrdom, whose, cult, was, sanctioned, in, contrast, with, earlier, holy, monarchs, stephen, s, cult, spread, beyond, the, borders, of, hungary, initially, he, was, primarily, venerated, in, scheyern, and, bamberg, in, bavaria, but, his, relics, were, also, taken, to, aachen, cologne, montecassino, and, namur, upon, the, liberation, of, buda, from, the, ottoman, turks, pope, innocent, xi, expanded, king, saint, stephen, s, cult, to, the, entire, roman, catholic, church, in, 1686, and, declared, 2, september, his, feast, day, as, the, feast, of, saint, joachim, was, moved, in, 1969, from, 16, august, the, day, immediately, following, the, day, of, stephen, s, death, stephen, s, feast, was, moved, to, that, date, stephen, is, venerated, as, the, patron, saint, of, hungary, and, regarded, as, the, protector, of, kings, masons, stonecutters, stonemasons, and, bricklayers, and, also, of, children, suffering, from, severe, illnesses, his, canonization, was, recognized, by, ecumenical, patriarch, bartholomew, i, of, constantinople, in, 2000, in, the, calendar, of, the, hungarian, catholic, church, stephen, s, feast, is, observed, on, 20, august, the, day, on, which, his, relics, were, translated, in, addition, a, separate, feast, day, 30, may, is, dedicated, to, his, holy, dexter, stephen, s, intact, dexter, or, right, hand, hungarian, szent, jobb, became, the, subject, of, a, cult, a, cleric, named, mercurius, stole, it, but, it, was, discovered, on, 30, may, 1084, in, bihar, county, the, theft, of, sacred, relics, or, furta, sacra, had, by, that, time, become, a, popular, topic, of, saints, biographies, bishop, hartvic, described, the, discovery, of, stephen, s, right, hand, in, accordance, with, this, tradition, referring, to, adventures, and, visions, an, abbey, erected, in, bihar, county, now, s, niob, romania, was, named, after, and, dedicated, to, the, veneration, of, the, holy, dexter, why, is, it, brothers, that, his, other, limbs, having, become, disjointed, and, his, flesh, having, been, reduced, to, dust, wholly, separated, only, the, right, hand, its, skin, and, sinews, adhering, to, the, bones, preserved, the, beauty, of, wholeness, i, surmise, that, the, inscrutability, of, divine, judgement, sought, to, proclaim, by, the, extraordinary, nature, of, this, fact, nothing, less, than, that, the, work, of, love, and, alms, surpasses, the, measure, of, all, other, virtues, the, right, hand, of, the, blessed, man, was, deservedly, exempt, from, putrefaction, because, always, reflourishing, from, the, flower, of, kindness, it, was, never, empty, from, giving, gifts, to, nourish, the, poor, the, holy, dexter, was, kept, for, centuries, in, the, szentjobb, abbey, except, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, 1241, and, 1242, when, it, was, transferred, to, ragusa, now, dubrovnik, croatia, the, relic, was, then, taken, to, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, around, 1420, following, the, ottoman, occupation, of, the, central, territories, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, in, the, mid, 16th, century, it, was, guarded, in, many, places, including, bosnia, ragusa, and, vienna, it, was, returned, to, hungary, in, 1771, when, queen, maria, theresa, donated, it, to, the, cloister, of, the, sisters, of, loreto, in, buda, it, was, kept, in, buda, castle, s, st, sigismund, chapel, between, around, 1900, and, 1944, in, a, cave, near, salzburg, in, 1944, and, 1945, and, again, by, the, sisters, of, loreto, in, buda, between, 1945, and, 1950, finally, since, 1950, the, holy, dexter, has, been, in, st, stephen, s, basilica, in, budapest, an, annual, procession, celebrating, the, relic, was, instituted, in, 1938, and, continued, until, 1950, when, the, procession, was, forbidden, by, the, communist, government, it, was, resumed, in, 1988, according, to, stephen, s, greater, legend, the, king, himself, compiled, a, book, for, his, son, on, moral, education, this, work, now, known, as, admonitions, or, de, institutione, morum, was, preserved, in, manuscripts, written, in, the, late, middle, ages, although, scholars, debate, whether, it, can, actually, be, attributed, to, the, king, or, a, cleric, most, of, them, agree, that, it, was, composed, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 11th, century, the, admonitions, argues, that, kingship, is, inseparably, connected, with, the, catholic, faith, its, author, emphasized, that, a, monarch, is, required, to, make, donations, to, the, church, and, regularly, consult, his, prelates, but, is, entitled, to, punish, clergymen, who, do, wrong, one, of, its, basic, ideas, was, that, a, sovereign, has, to, cooperate, with, the, pillars, of, his, rule, meaning, the, prelates, aristocrats, isp, ns, and, warriors, my, dearest, son, if, you, desire, to, honor, the, royal, crown, i, advise, i, counsel, i, urge, you, above, all, things, to, maintain, the, catholic, and, apostolic, faith, with, such, diligence, and, care, that, you, may, be, an, example, for, all, those, placed, under, you, by, god, and, that, all, the, clergy, may, rightly, call, you, a, man, of, true, christian, profession, failing, to, do, this, you, may, be, sure, that, you, will, not, be, called, a, christian, or, a, son, of, the, church, indeed, in, the, royal, palace, after, the, faith, itself, the, church, holds, second, place, first, constituted, and, spread, through, the, whole, world, by, his, members, the, apostles, and, holy, fathers, and, though, she,
