from, the, british, including, a, glut, of, surplus, munitions, he, launched, his, campaign, against, the, al, rashidi, in, 1920, by, 1922, they, had, been, all, but, destroyed, the, defeat, of, the, al, rashidi, doubled, the, size, of, saudi, territory, because, after, the, war, of, ha, il, ibn, saud, sent, his, army, to, occupy, al, jouf, and, the, army, led, by, eqab, bin, mohaya, the, head, of, the, talhah, tribe, this, allowed, ibn, saud, the, leverage, to, negotiate, a, new, and, more, favorable, treaty, with, the, british, in, 1922, signed, at, uqair, he, met, percy, cox, british, high, commissioner, in, iraq, to, draw, boundaries, and, the, treaty, saw, britain, recognize, many, of, ibn, saud, s, territorial, gains, in, exchange, ibn, saud, agreed, to, recognize, british, territories, in, the, area, particularly, along, the, persian, gulf, coast, and, in, iraq, the, former, of, these, were, vital, to, the, british, as, merchant, traffic, between, british, india, and,

arabian, peninsula, but, the, alliance, between, the, ikhwan, and, the, al, saud, collapsed, when, ibn, saud, forbade, further, raiding, the, few, portions, of, central, arabia, that, had, not, been, overrun, by, the, saudi, ikhwan, forces, had, treaties, with, london, and, ibn, saud, was, sober, enough, to, see, the, folly, of, provoking, the, british, by, pushing, into, these, areas, this, did, not, sit, well, with, the, ikhwan, who, had, been, taught, that, all, non, wahhabis, were, infidels, in, order, to, settle, down, the, problems, with, the, ikhwan, leaders, including, faisal, al, duwaish, sultan, bin, bajad, and, dhaydan, bin, hithlain, ibn, saud, organized, a, meeting, in, riyadh, in, 1928, but, none, of, them, attended, the, meeting, tensions, finally, boiled, over, when,

residence, and, the, seat, of, government, until, his, death, in, 1953, ibn, saud, had, to, first, eliminate, the, right, of, his, own, father, in, order, to, rule, and, then, distance, and, contain, the, ambitions, of, his, five, brothers, particularly, his, brother, muhammad, who, had, fought, with, him, during, the, battles, and, conquests, that, gave, birth, to, the, state, petroleum, was,

and, cease, any, further, attacks, against, their, protectorates, for, whom, they, were, responsible, ibn, saud, s, newly, found, oil, wealth, brought, a, great, deal, of, power, and, influence, that,

kingdom, s, ideology, based, on, the, teachings, of, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, this, included, an, end, to, traditionally, sanctioned, rites, of, pilgrimage, recognized, by, the, orthodox, schools, of, jurisprudence, but, at, odds, with, those, sanctioned, by, al, wahhab, in, 1926, after, a, caravan, of, egyptian, pilgrims, on, the, way, to, mecca, were, beaten, by, his, forces, for, playing, bugles, he, was, impelled, to, issue, a, conciliatory, statement, to, the, egyptian, government, in, fact, several, such, statements, were, issued, to, muslim, governments, around, the, world, as, a, result, of, beatings, suffered, by, the, pilgrims, visiting, the, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, with, the, uprising, and, subsequent, suppression, thereafter, of, the, ikhwan, in, 1929, the, 1930s, marked, a, turning, point, with, his, rivals, eliminated, ibn, saud, s, ideology, was, in, full, force, ending, nearly, 1, 400, years, of, accepted, religious, practices,

as, he, has, given, you, in, the, world, an, elderly, woman, once, said, to, ibn, saud, s, procession, the, king, ordered, that, she, be, given, ten, bags, of, money, from, his, car, ibn, saud,
