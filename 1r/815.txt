the, standards, for, the, discussion, of, aesthetic, and, literary, theoretical, principles, lessing, advocated, that, dramaturgs, should, carry, their, work, out, working, directly, with, theatre, companies, rather, than, in, isolation, in, his, religious, and, philosophical, writings, he, defended, the, faithful, christian, s, right, for, freedom, of, thought, he, argued, against, the, belief, in, revelation, and, the, holding, on, to, a, literal, interpretation, of, the, bible, by, the, predominant, orthodox, doctrine, through, a, problem, later, to, be, called, lessing, s, ditch, lessing, outlined, the, concept, of, the, religious, proof, of, power, how, can, miracles, continue, to, be, used, as, a, base, for, christianity, when, we, have, no, proof, of, miracles, historical, truths, which, are, in, doubt, cannot, be, used, to, prove, metaphysical, truths, such, as, god, s, existence, as, lessing, says, it, that, then, is, the, ugly, great, ditch, which, i, cannot, cross, however, often, and, however, earnestly, i, have, tried, to, make, that, leap, in, the, final, leg, of, his, life, lessing, threw, himself, into, an, intense, evaluation, of, theology, and, religion, he, did, much, of, his, studying, by, reading, manuscripts, he, found, while, working, as, a, librarian, while, working, for, the, duke, he, formed, a, close, friendship, with, a, family, by, the, name, of, reimarus, the, family, held, an, unpublished, manuscript, by, hermann, samuel, reimarus, which, attacked, the, historicity, of, christian, revelation, despite, discouragement, from, his, brother, karl, gotthelf, lessing, he, began, publishing, pieces, of, the, manuscript, in, pamphlets, known, as, fragments, from, an, unnamed, author, the, controversial, pamphlets, resulted, in, a, heated, debate, between, him, and, another, theologian, johann, melchior, goeze, in, concern, for, tarnishing, his, reputation, goeze, requested, the, government, put, an, end, to, the, feud, and, lessing, was, silenced, through, a, law, that, took, away, his, freedom, from, censorship, in, response, lessing, relied, upon, his, skills, as, a, playwright, to, write, what, is, undoubtedly, his, most, influential, play, nathan, the, wise, in, the, play, lessing, set, up, tension, between, judaism, islam, and, christianity, by, having, one, character, ask, nathan, which, religion, was, the, most, genuine, nathan, avoids, the, question, by, telling, the, parable, of, the, three, rings, which, implies, the, idea, that, no, specific, religion, is, the, correct, religion, the, enlightenment, ideas, to, which, lessing, held, tight, were, portrayed, through, his, ideal, of, humanity, stating, that, religion, is, relative, to, the, individual, s, ability, to, reason, nathan, the, wise, is, considered, to, be, the, first, example, of, the, german, literature, of, humanity, as, a, child, of, the, enlightenment, he, trusted, in, a, christianity, of, reason, which, oriented, itself, by, the, spirit, of, religion, he, believed, that, human, reason, initiated, by, criticism, and, dissent, would, develop, even, without, help, by, a, divine, revelation, in, his, writing, the, education, of, humankind, die, erziehung, des, menschengeschlechts, he, extensively, and, coherently, lays, out, his, position, the, idea, of, freedom, for, the, theatre, against, the, dominance, of, its, french, model, for, religion, from, the, church, s, dogma, is, his, central, theme, throughout, his, life, therefore, he, also, stood, up, for, the, liberation, of, the, upcoming, middle, and, upper, class, from, the, nobility, making, up, their, minds, for, them, in, his, own, literary, existence, he, also, constantly, strove, for, independence, but, his, ideal, of, a, possible, life, as, a, free, author, was, hard, to, keep, up, against, the, economic, constraints, he, faced, his, project, of, authors, self, publishing, their, works, which, he, tried, to, accomplish, in, hamburg, with, c, j, bode, failed, lessing, is, important, as, a, literary, critic, for, his, work, laocoon, an, essay, on, the, limits, of, painting, and, poetry, in, this, work, he, argues, against, the, tendency, to, take, horace, s, ut, pictura, poesis, as, painting, so, poetry, as, prescriptive, for, literature, in, other, words, he, objected, to, trying, to, write, poetry, using, the, same, devices, as, one, would, in, painting, instead, poetry, and, painting, each, has, its, character, the, former, is, extended, in, time, the, latter, is, extended, in, space, this, is, related, to, lessing, s, turn, from, french, classicism, to, aristotelian, mimesis, discussed, above, the, radical, pietist, johann, daniel, m, ller, born, 1716, in, wissenbach, nassau, today, part, of, eschenburg, deceased, after,
