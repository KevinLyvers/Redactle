the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, jain, texts, containing, mahavira, s, teachings, were, written, in, palm, leaf, manuscripts, according, to, the, digambaras, ch, rya, bhutabali, was, the, last, ascetic, with, partial, knowledge, of, the, original, canon, later, some, learned, ach, ryas, restored, compiled, and, wrote, down, the, teachings, of, mahavira, which, were, the, subjects, of, the, agamas, ch, rya, dharasena, in, the, 1st, century, ce, guided, the, ch, ryas, pushpadant, and, bhutabali, as, they, wrote, down, the, teachings, the, two, ch, ryas, wrote, a, kha, gama, among, the, oldest, known, digambara, texts, on, palm, leaves, the, jain, agamas, enumerate, five, vratas, vows, which, ascetics, and, householders, must, observe, these, ethical, principles, were, preached, by, mahavira, the, goal, of, these, principles, is, to, achieve, spiritual, peace, a, better, rebirth, or, ultimately, liberation, according, to, chakravarthi, these, teachings, help, improve, a, person, s, quality, of, life, however, dundas, writes, that, mahavira, s, emphasis, on, non, violence, and, restraint, has, been, interpreted, by, some, jain, scholars, to, not, be, driven, by, merit, from, giving, or, compassion, to, other, creatures, nor, a, duty, to, rescue, all, creatures, but, by, continual, self, discipline, a, cleansing, of, the, soul, which, leads, to, spiritual, development, and, release, mahavira, is, best, remembered, in, the, indian, traditions, for, his, teaching, that, ahimsa, is, the, supreme, moral, virtue, he, taught, that, ahimsa, covers, all, living, beings, and, injuring, any, being, in, any, form, creates, bad, karma, which, affects, one, s, rebirth, future, well, being, and, suffering, according, to, mahatma, gandhi, mahavira, was, the, greatest, authority, on, ahimsa, mahavira, taught, that, the, soul, exists, there, is, no, soul, or, self, in, buddhism, and, its, teachings, are, based, on, the, concept, of, anatta, non, self, mahavira, taught, that, the, soul, is, dravya, substantial, eternal, and, yet, temporary, to, mahavira, the, metaphysical, nature, of, the, universe, consists, of, dravya, jiva, and, ajiva, inanimate, objects, the, jiva, is, bound, to, sa, s, ra, transmigration, because, of, karma, the, effects, of, one, s, actions, karma, in, jainism, includes, actions, and, intent, it, colors, the, soul, lesya, affecting, how, where, and, as, what, a, soul, is, reborn, after, death, according, to, mahavira, there, is, no, creator, deity, and, existence, has, neither, beginning, nor, end, deities, and, demons, however, exist, in, jainism, whose, jivas, are, a, part, of, the, same, cycle, of, birth, and, death, the, goal, of, spiritual, practice, is, to, liberate, the, jiva, from, its, karmic, accumulation, and, enter, the, realm, of, the, siddhas, souls, who, are, liberated, from, rebirth, enlightenment, to, mahavira, is, the, consequence, of, self, awareness, self, cultivation, and, restraint, from, materialism, mahavira, also, taught, the, concept, of, bhedvijn, n, or, the, science, of, distinguishing, between, the, soul, jiva, and, the, non, soul, ajiva, central, to, his, teachings, bhedvijn, n, is, the, practice, of, realizing, the, distinction, between, the, pure, soul, which, is, eternal, formless, and, independent, and, the, temporary, external, aspects, of, existence, such, as, body, thoughts, emotions, and, karmic, influences, according, to, mahavira, this, understanding, is, crucial, for, attainment, of, nischay, samyak, darshan, experiential, self, realization, he, emphasized, that, human, suffering, arises, from, the, false, identification, of, the, soul, with, material, objects, including, the, body, and, mind, the, teachings, of, bhedvijn, n, guide, an, individual, to, recognize, what, is, truly, the, soul, and, what, is, not, by, distinguishing, between, the, pure, soul, and, the, transient, elements, of, life, one, can, cultivate, detachment, vairagya, and, move, toward, liberation, moksha, this, was, expounded, in, detail, in, works, of, acharya, kundkund, acharya, haribhadra, yashovijaya, and, shrimad, rajchandra, bhedvigyan, plays, a, key, role, in, the, progression, towards, self, realization, it, serves, as, a, stepping, stone, in, the, process, of, spiritual, awakening, where, the, aspirant, first, becomes, aware, of, their, mistaken, identity, with, the, non, soul, as, their, witness, bhed, nasti, and, later, become, aware, of, the, existence, and, true, nature, of, the, soul, itself, asti, this, process, ultimately, leads, to, the, direct, experience, of, the, soul, in, a, state, of, pure, awareness, destroying, karmic, attachments, in, jainism, this, knowledge, is, considered, the, foundation, for, developing, right, belief, samyak, darshan, and, attaining, samyak, gyan, omniscience, mahavira, taught, the, doctrine, of, anekantavada, many, sided, reality, although, the, word, does, not, appear, in, the, earliest, jain, literature, or, the, agamas, the, doctrine, is, illustrated, in, mahavira, s, answers, to, questions, posed, by, his, followers, truth, and, reality, are, complex, and, have, a, number, of, aspects, reality, can, be, experienced, but, it, is, impossible, to, express, it, fully, with, language, alone, human, attempts, to, communicate, are, nayas, partial, expression, of, the, truth, language, itself, is, not, truth, but, a, means, of, expressing, it, from, truth, according, to, mahavira, language, returns, not, the, other, way, around, one, can, experience, the, truth, of, a, taste, but, cannot, fully, express, that, taste, through, language, any, attempt, to, express, the, experience, is, sy, t, valid, in, some, respect, but, still, a, perhaps, just, one, perspective, incomplete, spiritual, truths, are, also, complex, with, multiple, aspects, and, language, cannot, express, their, plurality, however, they, can, be, experienced, through, effort, and, appropriate, karma, mahavira, s, anekantavada, doctrine, is, also, summarized, in, buddhist, texts, such, as, the, sama, aphala, sutta, in, which, he, is, called, nigantha, n, taputta, and, is, a, key, difference, between, the, teachings, of, mahavira, and, those, of, the, buddha, the, buddha, taught, the, middle, way, rejecting, the, extremes, of, it, is, or, it, is, not, mahavira, accepted, both, it, is, and, it, is, not, with, reconciliation, and, the, qualification, of, perhaps, the, jain, agamas, suggest, that, mahavira, s, approach, to, answering, metaphysical, philosophical, questions, was, a, qualified, yes, sy, t, a, version, of, this, doctrine, is, also, found, in, the, ajivika, school, of, ancient, indian, philosophy, according, to, dundas, the, anekantavada, doctrine, has, been, interpreted, by, many, jains, as, promot, a, universal, religious, tolerance, plurality, benign, attitude, to, other, positions, however, this, misreads, jain, historical, texts, and, mahavira, s, teachings, mahavira, s, many, pointedness, multiple, perspective, teachings, are, a, doctrine, about, the, nature, of, reality, and, human, existence, not, about, tolerating, religious, positions, such, as, sacrificing, animals, or, killing, them, for, food, or, violence, against, nonbelievers, or, any, other, living, being, as, perhaps, right, the, five, vows, for, jain, monks, and, nuns, are, strict, requirements, with, no, perhaps, mahavira, s, jainism, co, existed, with, buddhism, and, hinduism, beyond, the, renunciant, jain, communities, but, each, religion, was, highly, critical, of, the, knowledge, systems, and, ideologies, of, their, rivals, a, historically, contentious, view, in, jainism, is, partially, attributed, to, mahavira, and, his, ascetic, life,
