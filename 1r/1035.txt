empire, upon, his, father, s, death, he, consolidated, his, power, by, crushing, revolts, in, egypt, and, babylon, and, renewed, his, father, s, campaign, to, subjugate, greece, and, punish, athens,

thermopylae, and, artemisium, before, capturing, and, razing, athens, his, forces, gained, control, of, mainland, greece, north, of, the, isthmus, of, corinth, until, their, defeat, at, the, battle, of, salamis, fearing, that, the, greeks, might, trap, him, in, europe, xerxes, retreated, with, the, greater, part, of, his, army, back, to, asia, leaving, behind, mardonius, to, continue, his, campaign, mardonius, was, defeated, at, plataea, the, following, year, effectively, ending, the, persian, invasion, after, returning, to, persia, xerxes, dedicated, himself, to, large, scale, construction, projects, many, of, which, had, been, left, unfinished, by, his, father, he, oversaw, the, completion, of, the, gate, of, all, nations, the, apadana, and, the, tachara, at, persepolis, and, continued, the, construction, of, the, palace, of, darius, at, susa, he, also, maintained, the, royal, road, built, by, his, father, in, 465, bc, xerxes, and, his, heir, darius, were, assassinated, by, artabanus, the, commander, of, the, royal, bodyguard, he, was, succeeded, by, his, third, son, who, took, the, throne, as, artaxerxes, i, x, rx, s, is, the, greek, and, latin, xerxes, xerses, transliteration, of, the, old, iranian, x, aya, ruling, over, heroes, which, can, be, seen, by, the, first, part, x, aya, meaning, ruling, and, the, second, meaning, hero, man, the, name, of, xerxes, was, known, in, akkadian, as, i, i, ar, and, in, aramaic, as, y, r, xerxes, would, become, a, popular, name, among, the, rulers, of, the, achaemenid, empire, xerxes, father, was, darius, the, great, r, 522, 486, bc, the, incumbent, monarch, of, the, achaemenid, empire, albeit, himself, not, a, member, of, the, family, of, cyrus, the, great, the, founder, of, the, empire, xerxes, mother, was, atossa, a, daughter, of, cyrus, darius, and, atossa, married, in, 522, bc, and, xerxes, was, born, around, 518, bc, according, to, the, greek, dialogue, first, alcibiades, which, describes, typical, upbringing, and, education, of, persian, princes, they, were, raised, by, eunuchs, starting, at, the, age, of, seven, they, learned, how, to, ride, and, hunt, after, reaching, the, age, of, fourteen, they, were, each, taught, by, four, teachers, from, aristocratic, backgrounds, who, taught, them, how, to, be, wise, just, prudent, and, brave, persian, princes, also, learned, the, basics, of, the, zoroastrian, religion, and, were, taught, to, be, truthful, to, be, courageous, and, to, have, self, restraint, the, dialogue, further, added, that, fear, for, a, persian, is, the, equivalent, of, slavery, at, the, age, of, 16, or, 17, they, began, their, mandatory, 10, years, of, national, service, which, included, practicing, archery, and, javelin, competing, for, prizes, and, hunting, afterwards, they, served, in, the, military, for, around, 25, years, after, which, they, were, elevated, to, the, status, of, elders, and, advisers, to, the, king, families, in, this, time, including, xerxes, would, intermarry, this, account, of, education, among, the, persian, elite, is, supported, by, xenophon, s, description, of, the, 5th, century, bc, achaemenid, prince, cyrus, the, younger, with, whom, he, was, well, acquainted, stoneman, suggests, that, this, was, the, type, of, upbringing, and, education, that, xerxes, experienced, it, is, unknown, if, xerxes, ever, learned, to, read, or, write, with, the, persians, favoring, oral, history, over, written, literature, stoneman, suggests, that, xerxes, upbringing, and, education, was, possibly, not, much, different, from, that, of, the, later, iranian, kings, such, as, abbas, the, great, king, of, the, safavid, empire, in, the, 17th, century, ad, starting, from, 498, bc, xerxes, resided, in, the, royal, palace, of, babylon, while, darius, was, preparing, for, another, war, against, greece, a, revolt, began, in, egypt, in, 486, bc, due, to, heavy, taxes, and, the, deportation, of, craftsmen, to, build, the, royal, palaces, at, susa, and, persepolis, the, king, was, required, by, persian, law, to, choose, a, successor, before, setting, out, on, dangerous, expeditions, when, darius, decided, to, leave, for, egypt, 487, 486, bc, he, prepared, his, tomb, at, naqsh, e, rustam, five, kilometers, from, his, royal, palace, at, persepolis, and, appointed, xerxes, his, eldest, son, by, atossa, as, his, successor, however, darius, could, not, lead, the, campaign, due, to, his, failing, health, he, died, in, october, 486, bc, at, the, age, of, 64, artobazan, claimed, that, he, should, take, the, crown, as, the, eldest, of, all, darius, children, while, xerxes, argued, for, his, own, claim, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, the, son, of, atossa, the, daughter, of, cyrus, and, that, cyrus, had, won, the, persians, their, freedom, xerxes, claim, was, supported, by, a, spartan, king, in, exile, who, was, present, in, persia, at, the, time, the, eurypontid, king, demaratus, who, also, argued, that, the, eldest, son, did, not, universally, have, the, best, claim, to, the, crown, citing, spartan, law, which, stated, that, the, first, son, born, while, the, father, is, king, was, the, heir, to, the, kingship, some, modern, scholars, also, view, the, unusual, decision, of, darius, to, give, the, throne, to, xerxes, as, a, result, of, his, consideration, of, the, particular, prestige, that, cyrus, the, great, and, his, daughter, atossa, enjoyed, artobazan, was, born, to, darius, the, subject, while, xerxes, was, the, eldest, son, born, in, the, purple, after, darius, rise, to, the, throne, furthermore, while, artobazan, s, mother, was, a, commoner, xerxes, mother, was, the, daughter, of, the, founder, of, the, achaemenid, empire, xerxes, was, crowned, and, succeeded, his, father, in, october, december, 486, bc, when, he, was, about, 32, years, old, the, transition, of, power, to, xerxes, was, smooth, due, again, in, part, to, the, great, authority, of, atossa, and, his, accession, to, royal, power, was, not, challenged, by, any, person, at, court, or, in, the, achaemenian, family, or, by, any, subject, nation, at, the, time, of, xerxes, accession, trouble, was, brewing, in, some, of, his, domains, a, revolt, occurred, in, egypt, which, seems, dangerous, enough, for, xerxes, to, personally, lead, the, army, to, restore, order, which, also, gave, him, the, opportunity, to, begin, his, reign, with, a, military, campaign, xerxes, suppressed, the, revolt, in, january, 484, bc, and, appointed, his, full, brother, achaemenes, as, satrap, of, egypt, replacing, the, previous, satrap, pherendates, who, was, reportedly, killed, during, the, revolt, the, suppression, of, the, egyptian, revolt, expended, the, army, which, had, been, mobilized, by, darius, over, the, previous, three, years, xerxes, therefore, had, to, raise, another, army, for, his, expedition, into, greece, which, took, another, four, years, there, was, also, unrest, in, babylon, which, revolted, at, least, twice, against, xerxes, during, his, reign, the, first, revolt, broke, out, in, june, or, july, of, 484, bc, and, was, led, by, a, rebel, of, the, name, bel, shimanni, bel, shimmani, s, revolt, was, short, lived, babylonian, documents, written, during, his, reign, only, account, for, a, period, of, two, weeks, two, years, later, babylon, produced, another, rebel, leader, shamash, eriba, beginning, in, the, summer, of, 482, bc, shamash, eriba, seized, babylon, itself, and, other, nearby, cities, such, as, borsippa, and, dilbat, and, was, only, defeated, in, march, 481, bc, after, a, lengthy, siege, of, babylon, the, precise, cause, of, the, unrest, in, babylon, is, uncertain, it, may, have, been, due, to, tax, increases, prior, to, these, revolts, babylon, had, occupied, a, special, position, within, the, achaemenid, empire, the, achaemenid, kings, had, held, the, titles, of, king, of, babylon, and, king, of, the, lands, implying, that, they, perceived, babylonia, as, a, somewhat, separate, entity, within, their, empire, united, with, their, own, kingdom, in, a, personal, union, after, the, revolts, however, xerxes, dropped, king, of, babylon, from, his, titulature, and, divided, the, previously, large, babylonian, satrapy, accounting, for, most, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, s, territory, into, smaller, sub, units, based, on, texts, written, by, classical, authors, it, is, often, assumed, that, xerxes, enacted, a, brutal, vengeance, on, babylon, following, the, two, revolts, according, to, ancient, writers, xerxes, destroyed, babylon, s, fortifications, and, damaged, the, temples, in, the, city, the, esagila, was, allegedly, subject, to, great, damage, and, xerxes, allegedly, carried, the, statue, of, marduk, away, from, the, city, possibly, bringing, it, to, iran, and, melting, it, down, classical, authors, hold, that, the, statue, was, made, entirely, of, gold, which, would, have, made, melting, it, down, possible, modern, historian, am, lie, kuhrt, considers, it, unlikely, that, xerxes, destroyed, the, temples, but, believes, that, the, story, of, him, doing, so, may, derive, from, an, anti, persian, sentiment, among, the, babylonians, it, is, doubtful, if, the, statue, was, removed, from, babylon, at, all, and, some, have, even, suggested, that, xerxes, did, remove, a, statue, from, the, city, but, that, this, was, the, golden, statue, of, a, man, rather, than, the, statue, of, the, god, marduk, though, mentions, of, it, are, lacking, considerably, compared, to, earlier, periods, contemporary, documents, suggest, that, the, babylonian, new, year, s, festival, continued, in, some, form, during, the, achaemenid, period, because, the, change, in, rulership, from, the, babylonians, themselves, to, the, persians, and, due, to, the, replacement, of, the, city, s, elite, families, by, xerxes, following, its, revolt, it, is, possible, that, the, festival, s, traditional, rituals, and, events, had, changed, considerably, darius, died, while, in, the, process, of, preparing, a, second, army, to, invade, the, greek, mainland, leaving, to, his, son, the, task, of, punishing, the, athenians, naxians, and, eretrians, for, their, interference, in, the, ionian, revolt, the, burning, of, sardis, and, their, victory, over, the, persians, at, marathon, from, 483, bc, xerxes, prepared, his, expedition, the, xerxes, canal, was, dug, through, the, isthmus, of, the, peninsula, of, mount, athos, provisions, were, stored, in, the, stations, on, the, road, through, thrace, and, two, pontoon, bridges, later, known, as, xerxes, pontoon, bridges, were, built, across, the, hellespont, soldiers, of, many, nationalities, served, in, the, armies, of, xerxes, from, all, over, his, multi, ethnic, massive, eurasian, sized, empire, and, beyond, including, the, assyrians, phoenicians, babylonians, egyptians, jews, macedonians, european, thracians, paeonians, achaean, greeks, ionians, aegean, islanders, aeolians, greeks, from, pontus, colchians, sindhis, and, many, more, according, to, the, greek, historian, herodotus, xerxes, s, first, attempt, to, bridge, the, hellespont, ended, in, failure, when, a, storm, destroyed, the, flax, and, papyrus, cables, of, the, bridges, in, retaliation, xerxes, ordered, the, hellespont, the, strait, itself, whipped, three, hundred, times, and, had, fetters, thrown, into, the, water, xerxes, s, second, attempt, to, bridge, the, hellespont, was, successful, the, carthaginian, invasion, of, sicily, deprived, greece, of, the, support, of, the, powerful, monarchs, of, syracuse, and, agrigentum, ancient, sources, assume, xerxes, was, responsible, modern, scholarship, is, skeptical, many, smaller, greek, states, moreover, took, the, side, of, the, persians, especially, thessaly, thebes, and, argos, xerxes, was, victorious, during, the, initial, battles, xerxes, set, out, in, the, spring, of, 480, bc, from, sardis, with, a, fleet, and, army, which, herodotus, estimated, was, roughly, one, million, strong, along, with, 10, 000, elite, warriors, named, the, immortals, more, recent, estimates, place, the, persian, force, at, around, 60, 000, combatants, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, a, small, force, of, greek, warriors, led, by, king, leonidas, of, sparta, resisted, the, much, larger, persian, forces, but, were, ultimately, defeated, according, to, herodotus, the, persians, broke, the, spartan, phalanx, after, a, greek, man, called, ephialtes, betrayed, his, country, by, telling, the, persians, of, another, pass, around, the, mountains, at, artemisium, large, storms, had, destroyed, ships, from, the, greek, side, and, so, the, battle, stopped, prematurely, as, the, greeks, received, news, of, the, defeat, at, thermopylae, and, retreated, after, thermopylae, athens, was, captured, most, of, the, athenians, had, abandoned, the, city, and, fled, to, the, island, of, salamis, before, xerxes, arrived, a, small, group, attempted, to, defend, the, athenian, acropolis, but, they, were, defeated, xerxes, ordered, the, destruction, of, athens, and, burnt, the, city, leaving, an, archaeologically, attested, destruction, layer, known, as, the, perserschutt, the, persians, thus, gained, control, of, all, of, mainland, greece, to, the, north, of, the, isthmus, of, corinth, xerxes, was, induced, by, the, message, of, themistocles, against, the, advice, of, artemisia, of, halicarnassus, to, attack, the, greek, fleet, under, unfavourable, conditions, rather, than, sending, a, part, of, his, ships, to, the, peloponnesus, and, awaiting, the, dissolution, of, the, greek, armies, the, battle, of, salamis, september, 480, bc, was, won, by, the, greek, fleet, after, which, xerxes, set, up, a, winter, camp, in, thessaly, according, to, herodotus, fearing, that, the, greeks, might, attack, the, bridges, across, the, hellespont, and, trap, his, army, in, europe, xerxes, decided, to, retreat, back, to, asia, taking, the, greater, part, of, the, army, with, him, another, cause, of, the, retreat, might, have, been, that, the, continued, unrest, in, babylon, a, key, province, of, the, empire, required, the, king, s, personal, attention, he, left, behind, a, contingent, in, greece, to, finish, the, campaign, under, mardonius, who, according, to, herodotus, had, suggested, the, retreat, in, the, first, place, this, force, was, defeated, the, following, year, at, plataea, by, the, combined, forces, of, the, greek, city, states, ending, the, persian, offensive, on, greece, for, good, after, his, military, blunders, in, greece, xerxes, returned, to, persia, and, oversaw, the, completion, of, the, many, construction, projects, left, unfinished, by, his, father, at, susa, and, persepolis, he, oversaw, the, building, of, the, gate, of, all, nations, and, the, hall, of, a, hundred, columns, at, persepolis, which, are, the, largest, and, most, imposing, structures, of, the, palace, he, oversaw, the, completion, of, the, apadana, the, tachara, palace, of, darius, and, the, treasury, all, started, by, darius, as, well, as, having, his, own, palace, built, which, was, twice, the, size, of, his, father, s, his, taste, in, architecture, was, similar, to, that, of, darius, though, on, an, even, more, gigantic, scale, he, had, colorful, enameled, brick, laid, on, the, exterior, face, of, the, apadana, he, also, maintained, the, royal, road, built, by, his, father, and, completed, the, susa, gate, and, built, a, palace, in, susa, in, august, 465, bc, artabanus, the, commander, of, the, royal, bodyguard, and, the, most, powerful, official, in, the, persian, court, assassinated, xerxes, with, the, help, of, a, eunuch, aspamitres, although, the, hyrcanian, artabanus, bore, the, same, name, as, the, famed, uncle, of, xerxes, his, rise, to, prominence, was, due, to, his, popularity, in, religious, quarters, of, the, court, and, harem, intrigues, he, put, his, seven, sons, in, key, positions, and, had, a, plan, to, dethrone, the, achaemenids, greek, historians, give, differing, accounts, of, events, according, to, ctesias, in, persica, 20, artabanus, then, accused, the, crown, prince, darius, xerxes, s, eldest, son, of, the, murder, and, persuaded, another, of, xerxes, s, sons, artaxerxes, to, avenge, the, patricide, by, killing, darius, but, according, to, aristotle, in, politics, 5, 1311b, artabanus, killed, darius, first, and, then, killed, xerxes, after, artaxerxes, discovered, the, murder, he, killed, artabanus, and, his, sons, participating, in, these, intrigues, was, the, general, megabyzus, whose, decision, to, switch, sides, probably, saved, the, achaemenids, from, losing, their, control, of, the, persian, throne, while, there, is, no, general, consensus, in, scholarship, as, to, whether, xerxes, and, his, predecessors, had, been, influenced, by, zoroastrianism, it, is, well, established, that, xerxes, was, a, firm, believer, in, ahura, mazda, whom, he, saw, as, the, supreme, deity, however, ahura, mazda, was, also, worshipped, by, adherents, of, the, indo, iranian, religious, tradition, on, his, treatment, of, other, religions, xerxes, followed, the, same, policy, as, his, predecessors, he, appealed, to, local, religious, scholars, made, sacrifices, to, local, deities, and, destroyed, temples, in, cities, and, countries, that, caused, disorder, by, queen, amestris, by, unknown, wives, or, mistresses, xerxes, presentation, in, greek, and, roman, sources, is, largely, negative, and, this, set, the, tone, for, most, subsequent, depictions, of, him, within, the, western, tradition, xerxes, is, a, central, character, of, aeschylus, play, the, persians, first, performed, in, athens, in, 472, bc, only, seven, years, after, his, invasion, of, greece, the, play, presents, him, as, an, effeminate, figure, and, his, hubristic, effort, to, bring, both, asia, and, europe, under, his, control, leads, to, the, ruin, of, both, himself, and, his, kingdom, herodotus, s, histories, written, later, in, the, fifth, century, bc, centre, on, the, persian, wars, with, xerxes, as, a, major, figure, some, of, herodotus, information, is, spurious, pierre, briant, has, accused, him, of, presenting, a, stereotyped, and, biased, portrayal, of, the, persians, richard, stoneman, regards, his, portrayal, of, xerxes, as, nuanced, and, tragic, compared, to, the, vilification, that, he, suffered, at, the, hands, of, the, macedonian, king, alexander, the, great, r, 336, 323, bc, xerxes, is, identified, with, the, king, ahasuerus, in, the, biblical, book, of, esther, which, some, scholars, including, eduard, schwartz, william, rainey, harper, and, michael, v, fox, consider, to, be, historical, romance, there, is, nothing, close, to, a, consensus, however, as, to, what, historical, event, provided, the, basis, for, the, story, xerxes, is, the, protagonist, of, the, opera, serse, by, the, german, english, baroque, composer, george, frideric, handel, it, was, first, performed, in, the, king, s, theatre, london, on, 15, april, 1738, the, famous, aria, ombra, mai, f, opens, the, opera, the, murder, of, xerxes, by, artabanus, artabano, execution, of, crown, prince, darius, dario, revolt, by, megabyzus, megabise, and, subsequent, succession, of, artaxerxes, i, is, romanticised, by, the, italian, poet, metastasio, in, his, opera, libretto, artaserse, 1730, which, was, first, set, to, music, by, leonardo, vinci, and, subsequently, by, other, composers, such, as, johann, adolf, hasse, and, johann, christian, bach, the, historical, novel, xerxes, of, de, hoogmoed, 1919, by, dutch, writer, louis, couperus, describes, the, persian, wars, from, the, perspective, of, xerxes, though, the, account, is, fictionalised, couperus, nevertheless, based, himself, on, an, extensive, study, of, herodotus, the, english, translation, arrogance, the, conquests, of, xerxes, by, frederick, h, martens, appeared, in, 1930, later, generations, fascination, with, ancient, sparta, particularly, the, battle, of, thermopylae, has, led, to, xerxes, portrayal, in, works, of, popular, culture, he, was, played, by, david, farrar, in, the, film, the, 300, spartans, 1962, where, he, is, portrayed, as, a, cruel, power, crazed, despot, and, an, inept, commander, he, also, features, prominently, in, the, graphic, novels, 300, and, xerxes, the, fall, of, the, house, of, darius, and, the, rise, of, alexander, by, frank, miller, as, well, as, the, film, adaptation, 300, 2007, and, its, sequel, 300, rise, of, an, empire, 2014, as, portrayed, by, brazilian, actor, rodrigo, santoro, in, which, he, is, represented, as, a, giant, man, with, androgynous, qualities, who, claims, to, be, a, god, king, this, portrayal, attracted, controversy, especially, in, iran, ken, davitian, plays, xerxes, in, meet, the, spartans, a, parody, of, the, first, 300, movie, replete, with, sophomoric, humour, and, deliberate, anachronisms, similarly, a, highly, satirized, depiction, of, xerxes, based, on, his, portrayal, in, 300, appears, in, the, south, park, episode, d, yikes, other, works, dealing, with, the, persian, empire, or, the, biblical, story, of, esther, have, also, featured, or, alluded, to, xerxes, such, as, the, video, game, assassin, s, creed, odyssey, and,

swordsman, gore, vidal, in, his, historical, fiction, novel, creation, 1981, describes, at, length, the, rise, of, the, achaemenids, especially, darius, i, and, presents, the, life, and, death,

becoming, the, boyhood, friend, of, xerxes, and, later, a, diplomat, who, is, sent, to, india, and, later, to, greece, and, who, is, thereby, able, to, gain, privileged, access, to, many, leading, historical, figures, of, the, period, xerxes, ahasuerus, is, portrayed, by, richard, egan, in, the, 1960, film, esther, and, the, king, and, by, joel, smallbone, in, the, 2013, film, the, book, of, esther, in, at, least, one, of, these, films, the, events, of, the, book, of, esther, are, depicted, as, taking, place, upon, xerxes, return, from, greece, xerxes, plays, an, important, background,
