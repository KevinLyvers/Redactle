wernher, magnus, maximilian, freiherr, von, braun, us, v, r, n, r, v, n, b, r, a, n, vur, n, r, von, brown, german, 23, march, 1912, 16, june, 1977, was, a, german, american, aerospace, engineer, and, space, architect, he, was, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, and, allgemeine, ss, the, leading, figure, in, the, development, of, rocket, technology, in, nazi, germany, and, later, a, pioneer, of, rocket, and, space, technology, in, the, united, states, as, a, young, man, von, braun, worked, in, nazi, germany, s, rocket, development, program, he, helped, design, and, co, developed, the, v, 2, rocket, at, peenem, nde, during, world, war, ii, the, v, 2, became, the, first, artificial, object, to, travel, into, space, on, 20, june, 1944, following, the, war, he, was, secretly, moved, to, the, united, states, along, with, about, 1, 600, other, german, scientists, engineers, and, technicians, as, part, of, operation, paperclip, he, worked, for, the, united, states, army, on, an, intermediate, range, ballistic, missile, program, and, he, developed, the, rockets, that, launched, the, united, states, first, space, satellite, explorer, 1, in, 1958, he, worked, with, walt, disney, on, a, series, of, films, which, popularized, the, idea, of, human, space, travel, in, the, u, s, and, beyond, from, 1955, to, 1957, in, 1960, his, group, was, assimilated, into, nasa, where, he, served, as, director, of, the, newly, formed, marshall, space, flight, center, and, as, the, chief, architect, of, the, saturn, v, super, heavy, lift, launch, vehicle, that, propelled, the, apollo, spacecraft, to, the, moon, in, 1967, von, braun, was, inducted, into, the, national, academy, of, engineering, and, in, 1975, he, received, the, national, medal, of, science, von, braun, is, a, highly, controversial, figure, widely, seen, as, escaping, justice, for, his, nazi, war, crimes, due, to, the, americans, desire, to, beat, the, soviets, in, the, cold, war, he, is, also, sometimes, described, by, others, as, the, father, of, space, travel, the, father, of, rocket, science, or, the, father, of, the, american, lunar, program, he, advocated, a, human, mission, to, mars, wernher, von, braun, was, born, on, 23, march, 1912, in, the, small, town, of, wirsitz, in, the, province, of, posen, kingdom, of, prussia, then, german, empire, and, now, poland, his, father, magnus, freiherr, von, braun, 1878, 1972, was, a, civil, servant, and, conservative, politician, he, served, as, minister, of, agriculture, in, the, federal, government, during, the, weimar, republic, his, mother, emmy, von, quistorp, 1886, 1959, traced, her, ancestry, through, both, parents, to, medieval, european, royalty, and, was, a, descendant, of, philip, iii, of, france, valdemar, i, of, denmark, robert, iii, of, scotland, and, edward, iii, of, england, he, had, an, older, brother, the, west, german, diplomat, sigismund, von, braun, who, served, as, secretary, of, state, in, the, foreign, office, in, the, 1970s, and, a, younger, brother, magnus, von, braun, who, was, a, rocket, scientist, and, later, a, senior, executive, with, chrysler, the, family, moved, to, berlin, brandenburg, in, 1915, where, his, father, worked, at, the, ministry, of, the, interior, after, his, confirmation, his, mother, gave, him, a, telescope, and, he, developed, a, passion, for, astronomy, von, braun, learned, to, play, both, the, cello, and, the, piano, at, an, early, age, and, at, one, time, wanted, to, become, a, composer, he, took, lessons, from, the, composer, paul, hindemith, the, few, pieces, of, von, braun, s, youthful, compositions, that, exist, are, reminiscent, of, hindemith, s, style, 11, he, could, play, piano, pieces, of, beethoven, and, bach, from, memory, beginning, in, 1925, he, attended, a, boarding, school, at, ettersburg, castle, near, weimar, free, state, of, thuringia, where, he, did, not, do, well, in, physics, and, mathematics, there, he, acquired, a, copy, of, die, rakete, zu, den, planetenr, umen, 1923, by, rocket, into, planetary, space, by, rocket, pioneer, hermann, oberth, in, 1928, his, parents, moved, him, to, the, hermann, lietz, internat, also, a, residential, school, on, the, east, frisian, north, sea, island, of, spiekeroog, space, travel, had, always, fascinated, him, and, from, then, on, he, applied, himself, to, physics, and, mathematics, to, pursue, his, interest, in, rocket, engineering, in, 1928, the, raketenrummel, or, rocket, rumble, fad, initiated, by, fritz, von, opel, and, max, valier, was, highly, influential, on, von, braun, as, a, teenage, space, enthusiast, he, was, so, enthusiastic, after, seeing, one, of, the, public, opel, rak, rocket, car, demonstrations, that, he, constructed, his, own, homemade, toy, rocket, car, and, caused, a, disruption, in, a, crowded, sidewalk, by, launching, the, toy, wagon, to, which, he, had, attached, the, largest, firework, rockets, he, could, purchase, he, was, later, taken, in, for, questioning, by, the, local, police, until, released, to, his, father, for, disciplinary, action, the, incident, highlighted, the, young, von, braun, s, determination, to, dedicate, his, life, to, space, travel, 62, 64, in, 1930, von, braun, attended, the, technische, hochschule, berlin, where, he, joined, the, spaceflight, society, verein, f, r, raumschiffahrt, or, vfr, co, founded, by, valier, and, worked, with, willy, ley, in, his, liquid, fueled, rocket, motor, tests, in, conjunction, with, others, such, as, rolf, engel, rudolf, nebel, hermann, oberth, or, paul, ehmayr, in, spring, 1932, he, graduated, with, a, diploma, in, mechanical, engineering, his, early, exposure, to, rocketry, convinced, him, that, the, exploration, of, space, would, require, far, more, than, applications, of, the, current, engineering, technology, wanting, to, learn, more, about, physics, chemistry, and, astronomy, von, braun, entered, the, friedrich, wilhelm, university, of, berlin, for, doctoral, studies, and, graduated, with, a, doctorate, in, physics, in, 1934, he, also, studied, at, eth, z, rich, for, a, term, from, june, to, october, 1931, in, 1930, von, braun, attended, a, presentation, given, by, auguste, piccard, after, the, talk, the, young, student, approached, the, famous, pioneer, of, high, altitude, balloon, flight, and, stated, to, him, you, know, i, plan, on, traveling, to, the, moon, at, some, time, piccard, is, said, to, have, responded, with, encouraging, words, von, braun, was, greatly, influenced, by, oberth, of, whom, he, said, hermann, oberth, was, the, first, who, when, thinking, about, the, possibility, of, spaceships, grabbed, a, slide, rule, and, presented, mathematically, analyzed, concepts, and, designs, i, myself, owe, to, him, not, only, the, guiding, star, of, my, life, but, also, my, first, contact, with, the, theoretical, and, practical, aspects, of, rocketry, and, space, travel, a, place, of, honor, should, be, reserved, in, the, history, of, science, and, technology, for, his, ground, breaking, contributions, in, the, field, of, astronautics, according, to, historian, norman, davies, von, braun, was, able, to, pursue, a, career, as, a, rocket, scientist, in, germany, due, to, a, curious, oversight, in, the, treaty, of, versailles, which, did, not, include, rocketry, in, its, list, of, weapons, forbidden, to, germany, von, braun, was, an, opportunist, who, joined, the, nazi, party, to, continue, his, work, on, rockets, for, nazi, germany, he, applied, for, membership, in, the, party, on, 12, november, 1937, and, was, issued, membership, number, 5, 738, 692, 96, michael, j, neufeld, an, author, of, aerospace, history, and, chief, of, the, space, history, division, at, the, smithsonian, s, national, air, and, space, museum, wrote, that, ten, years, after, von, braun, obtained, his, nazi, party, membership, he, signed, an, affidavit, for, the, u, s, army, though, he, stated, the, incorrect, year, 96, in, 1939, i, was, officially, demanded, to, join, the, national, socialist, party, at, this, time, i, was, already, technical, director, at, the, army, rocket, center, at, peenem, nde, baltic, sea, the, technical, work, carried, out, there, had, in, the, meantime, attracted, more, and, more, attention, in, higher, levels, thus, my, refusal, to, join, the, party, would, have, meant, that, i, would, have, to, abandon, the, work, of, my, life, therefore, i, decided, to, join, my, membership, in, the, party, did, not, involve, any, political, activity, 96, it, has, not, been, ascertained, whether, von, braun, s, error, with, regard, to, the, year, was, deliberate, or, a, simple, mistake, 96, neufeld, wrote, von, braun, like, other, peenem, nders, was, assigned, to, the, local, group, in, karlshagen, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, did, more, than, send, in, his, monthly, dues, but, he, is, seen, in, some, photographs, with, the, party, s, swastika, pin, in, his, lapel, it, was, politically, useful, to, demonstrate, his, membership, 96, von, braun, s, later, attitude, toward, the, nazi, regime, of, the, late, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, was, complex, he, said, that, he, had, been, so, influenced, by, the, early, nazi, promise, of, release, from, the, post, world, war, i, economic, effects, that, his, patriotic, feelings, had, increased, in, a, 1952, memoir, article, he, admitted, that, at, that, time, he, fared, relatively, rather, well, under, totalitarianism, 96, 97, yet, he, also, wrote, that, to, us, hitler, was, still, only, a, pompous, fool, with, a, charlie, chaplin, moustache, and, that, he, perceived, him, as, another, napoleon, who, was, wholly, without, scruples, a, godless, man, who, thought, himself, the, only, god, later, examination, of, von, braun, s, background, conducted, by, the, united, states, federal, bureau, of, investigation, suggests, that, his, background, check, file, contained, no, derogatory, information, pertaining, to, his, involvement, in, the, party, but, it, was, found, that, he, had, numerous, letters, of, commendation, for, outstanding, performance, of, duties, during, his, time, working, under, the, nazi, party, overall, fbi, conclusions, point, to, von, braun, s, involvement, in, the, nazi, party, to, be, purely, for, the, advancement, of, his, academic, career, or, out, of, fear, of, imprisonment, or, execution, von, braun, joined, the, ss, horseback, riding, school, on, 1, november, 1933, as, an, ss, anw, rter, he, left, the, following, year, 63, in, 1940, von, braun, joined, the, ss, 47, and, was, given, the, rank, of, untersturmf, hrer, in, the, allgemeine, ss, and, issued, membership, number, 185, 068, 121, in, 1947, he, gave, the, u, s, war, department, this, explanation, in, spring, 1940, one, ss, standartenf, hrer, ss, colonel, m, ller, from, greifswald, a, bigger, town, in, the, vicinity, of, peenem, nde, looked, me, up, in, my, office, and, told, me, that, reichsf, hrer, ss, himmler, had, sent, him, with, the, order, to, urge, me, to, join, the, ss, i, told, him, i, was, so, busy, with, my, rocket, work, that, i, had, no, time, to, spare, for, any, political, activity, he, then, told, me, that, the, ss, would, cost, me, no, time, at, all, i, would, be, awarded, the, rank, of, a, untersturmfuehrer, lieutenant, and, it, were, a, very, definite, desire, of, himmler, that, i, attend, his, invitation, to, join, i, asked, m, ller, to, give, me, some, time, for, reflection, he, agreed, realizing, that, the, matter, was, of, highly, political, significance, for, the, relation, between, the, ss, and, the, army, i, called, immediately, on, my, military, superior, dr, dornberger, he, informed, me, that, the, ss, had, for, a, long, time, been, trying, to, get, their, finger, in, the, pie, of, the, rocket, work, i, asked, him, what, to, do, he, replied, on, the, spot, that, if, i, wanted, to, continue, our, mutual, work, i, had, no, alternative, but, to, join, when, shown, a, picture, of, himself, standing, behind, himmler, von, braun, said, that, he, had, only, worn, the, ss, uniform, that, one, time, but, in, 2002, a, former, ss, officer, at, peenem, nde, told, the, bbc, that, von, braun, had, regularly, worn, the, ss, uniform, to, official, meetings, he, began, as, an, untersturmf, hrer, second, lieutenant, and, was, promoted, three, times, by, himmler, the, last, time, in, june, 1943, to, ss, sturmbannf, hrer, major, von, braun, later, stated, that, these, were, simply, technical, promotions, received, each, year, regularly, by, mail, in, 1932, von, braun, received, a, bachelor, of, science, degree, in, mechanical, engineering, from, technische, hochschule, berlin, now, technische, universit, t, berlin, germany, during, a, period, in, 1931, von, braun, attended, the, eth, z, rich, in, switzerland, during, this, time, in, switzerland, von, braun, assisted, professor, hermann, oberth, in, writing, a, book, concerning, the, possibilities, of, creating, and, manufacturing, liquid, propellant, rockets, shortly, after, this, von, braun, founded, his, own, private, rocket, development, business, in, berlin, and, through, which, made, the, first, rocket, fired, by, gasoline, and, liquid, oxygen, in, 1932, having, caught, wind, of, von, braun, s, rocket, business, the, german, army, connected, with, von, braun, to, pursue, basic, missile, research, and, weather, data, experimentation, von, braun, said, that, the, german, government, financed, the, development, of, test, stands, and, facilities, for, experimentation, in, darmstadt, germany, in, 1939, von, braun, was, appointed, a, technical, advisor, at, peenem, nde, army, research, center, on, the, baltic, sea, in, 1933, von, braun, was, working, on, his, creative, doctorate, when, the, nazi, party, came, to, power, in, a, coalition, government, in, germany, rocketry, was, almost, immediately, moved, onto, the, national, agenda, an, artillery, captain, walter, dornberger, arranged, an, ordnance, department, research, grant, for, von, braun, who, then, worked, next, to, dornberger, s, existing, solid, fuel, rocket, test, site, at, kummersdorf, von, braun, received, his, doctorate, in, physics, aerospace, engineering, on, 27, july, 1934, from, the, university, of, berlin, for, a, thesis, titled, about, combustion, tests, his, doctoral, supervisor, was, erich, schumann, 61, however, this, thesis, represented, only, the, public, aspect, of, von, braun, s, work, his, actual, thesis, entitled, construction, theoretical, and, experimental, solution, to, the, problem, of, the, liquid, propellant, rocket, dated, 16, april, 1934, detailed, the, construction, and, design, of, the, a2, rocket, it, remained, classified, by, the, german, army, until, its, publication, in, 1960, by, the, end, of, 1934, his, group, had, successfully, launched, two, liquid, fuel, a2, rockets, that, rose, to, heights, of, 2, 2, and, 3, 5, km, 2, mi, von, braun, continued, his, guided, missile, work, throughout, world, war, two, and, met, with, adolf, hitler, on, several, occasions, being, formally, decorated, by, hitler, twice, including, being, awarded, the, iron, cross, at, the, time, germany, was, highly, interested, in, american, physicist, robert, h, goddard, s, research, before, 1939, german, scientists, occasionally, contacted, goddard, directly, with, technical, questions, von, braun, used, goddard, s, plans, from, various, journals, and, incorporated, them, into, the, building, of, the, aggregat, a, series, of, rockets, the, first, successful, launch, of, an, a, 4, took, place, on, 3, october, 1942, the, a, 4, rocket, became, well, known, as, the, v, 2, in, 1963, von, braun, reflected, on, the, history, of, rocketry, and, said, of, goddard, s, work, his, rockets, may, have, been, rather, crude, by, present, day, standards, but, they, blazed, the, trail, and, incorporated, many, features, used, in, our, most, modern, rockets, and, space, vehicles, goddard, confirmed, his, work, was, used, by, von, braun, in, 1944, shortly, before, the, nazis, began, firing, v, 2s, at, england, a, v, 2, crashed, in, sweden, and, some, parts, were, sent, to, an, annapolis, lab, where, goddard, was, doing, research, for, the, navy, if, this, was, the, so, called, b, ckebo, bomb, it, had, been, procured, by, the, british, in, exchange, for, spitfires, annapolis, would, have, received, some, parts, from, them, goddard, is, reported, to, have, recognized, components, he, had, invented, and, inferred, that, his, brainchild, had, been, turned, into, a, weapon, later, von, braun, said, i, have, very, deep, and, sincere, regret, for, the, victims, of, the, v, 2, rockets, but, there, were, victims, on, both, sides, a, war, is, a, war, and, when, my, country, is, at, war, my, duty, is, to, help, win, that, war, 351, the, engineer, who, designed, the, v2, wernher, von, braun, came, to, be, feted, as, a, hero, of, the, space, age, the, allies, realised, that, the, v, 2, was, a, machine, unlike, anything, they, had, developed, themselves, v, 2, the, nazi, rocket, that, launched, the, space, age, bbc, september, 2014, in, response, to, goddard, s, statements, von, braun, said, at, no, time, in, germany, did, i, or, any, of, my, associates, ever, see, a, goddard, patent, this, was, independently, confirmed, he, wrote, that, statements, that, he, had, lifted, goddard, s, work, were, the, furthest, from, the, truth, noting, that, goddard, s, paper, a, method, of, reaching, extreme, altitudes, which, was, studied, by, von, braun, and, oberth, lacked, the, specificity, of, liquid, fuel, experimentation, with, rockets, it, was, also, confirmed, that, he, was, responsible, for, an, estimated, 20, patentable, innovations, related, to, rocketry, as, well, as, receiving, u, s, patents, after, the, war, concerning, the, advancement, of, rocketry, documented, accounts, also, stated, he, provided, solutions, to, a, host, of, aerospace, engineering, problems, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, on, 22, december, 1942, adolf, hitler, ordered, the, production, of, the, a, 4, as, a, vengeance, weapon, and, the, peenem, nde, group, developed, it, to, target, london, following, von, braun, s, 7, july, 1943, presentation, of, a, color, movie, showing, an, a, 4, taking, off, hitler, was, so, enthusiastic, that, he, personally, made, von, braun, a, professor, shortly, thereafter, by, that, time, the, british, and, soviet, intelligence, agencies, were, aware, of, the, rocket, program, and, von, braun, s, team, at, peenem, nde, based, on, the, intelligence, provided, by, the, polish, underground, home, army, over, the, nights, of, 17, 18, august, 1943, raf, bomber, command, s, operation, hydra, dispatched, raids, on, the, peenem, nde, camp, consisting, of, 596, aircraft, and, dropped, 1, 800, tons, of, explosives, the, facility, was, salvaged, and, most, of, the, engineering, team, remained, unharmed, however, the, raids, killed, von, braun, s, engine, designer, walter, thiel, and, chief, engineer, walther, and, the, rocket, program, was, delayed, the, v, 2, became, the, first, artificial, object, to, travel, into, space, by, crossing, the, k, rm, n, line, with, the, vertical, launch, of, mw, 18014, on, 20, june, 1944, the, first, combat, a, 4, renamed, the, v, 2, vergeltungswaffe, 2, retaliation, vengeance, weapon, 2, for, propaganda, purposes, was, launched, toward, england, on, 7, september, 1944, only, 21, months, after, the, project, had, been, officially, commissioned, 184, doug, millard, of, the, science, museum, london, states, the, v, 2, was, a, quantum, leap, of, technological, change, we, got, to, the, moon, using, v, 2, technology, but, this, was, technology, that, was, developed, with, massive, resources, including, some, particularly, grim, ones, the, v, 2, programme, was, hugely, expensive, in, terms, of, lives, with, the, nazis, using, slave, labour, to, manufacture, these, rockets, in, 1936, von, braun, s, rocketry, team, working, at, kummersdorf, investigated, installing, liquid, fuelled, rockets, in, aircraft, ernst, heinkel, enthusiastically, supported, their, efforts, supplying, a, he, 72, and, later, two, he, 112s, for, the, experiments, later, in, 1936, erich, warsitz, was, seconded, by, the, rlm, to, von, braun, and, heinkel, because, he, had, been, recognized, as, one, of, the, most, experienced, test, pilots, of, the, time, and, because, he, also, had, an, extraordinary, fund, of, technical, knowledge, 30, after, he, familiarized, warsitz, with, a, test, stand, run, showing, him, the, corresponding, apparatus, in, the, aircraft, he, asked, are, you, with, us, and, will, you, test, the, rocket, in, the, air, then, warsitz, you, will, be, a, famous, man, and, later, we, will, fly, to, the, moon, with, you, at, the, helm, 35, in, june, 1937, at, neuhardenberg, a, large, field, about, 70, km, 43, mi, east, of, berlin, listed, as, a, reserve, airfield, in, the, event, of, war, one, of, these, latter, aircraft, was, flown, with, its, piston, engine, shut, down, during, flight, by, warsitz, at, which, time, it, was, propelled, by, von, braun, s, rocket, power, alone, despite, a, wheels, up, landing, and, the, fuselage, having, been, on, fire, it, proved, to, official, circles, that, an, aircraft, could, be, flown, satisfactorily, with, a, back, thrust, system, through, the, rear, 51, at, the, same, time, hellmuth, walter, s, experiments, into, hydrogen, peroxide, based, rockets, were, leading, toward, light, and, simple, rockets, that, appeared, well, suited, for, aircraft, installation, also, the, firm, of, hellmuth, walter, at, kiel, had, been, commissioned, by, the, rlm, to, build, a, rocket, engine, for, the, he, 112, so, there, were, two, different, new, rocket, motor, designs, at, neuhardenberg, whereas, von, braun, s, engines, were, powered, by, alcohol, and, liquid, oxygen, walter, engines, had, hydrogen, peroxide, and, calcium, permanganate, as, a, catalyst, von, braun, s, engines, used, direct, combustion, and, created, fire, while, the, walter, devices, used, hot, vapors, from, a, chemical, reaction, but, both, created, thrust, and, provided, high, speed, 41, the, subsequent, flights, with, the, he, 112, used, the, walter, rocket, instead, of, von, braun, s, it, was, more, reliable, simpler, to, operate, and, safer, for, the, test, pilot, warsitz, 55, ss, general, hans, kammler, who, as, an, engineer, had, constructed, several, concentration, camps, including, auschwitz, had, a, reputation, for, brutality, and, had, conceived, the, idea, of, using, concentration, camp, prisoners, as, slave, laborers, in, the, rocket, program, arthur, rudolph, chief, engineer, of, the, v, 2, rocket, factory, at, peenem, nde, endorsed, this, idea, in, april, 1943, when, a, labor, shortage, developed, more, people, died, building, the, v, 2, rockets, than, were, killed, by, it, as, a, weapon, von, braun, admitted, visiting, the, plant, at, mittelwerk, on, many, occasions, and, called, conditions, at, the, plant, repulsive, but, stated, that, he, had, never, personally, witnessed, any, deaths, or, beatings, although, it, had, become, clear, to, him, by, 1944, that, deaths, had, occurred, he, denied, ever, having, visited, the, mittelbau, dora, concentration, camp, where, 20, 000, died, from, illness, beatings, hangings, and, intolerable, working, conditions, some, prisoners, state, that, von, braun, engaged, in, brutal, treatment, or, approved, of, it, guy, morand, a, french, resistance, fighter, who, was, a, prisoner, in, dora, testified, in, 1995, that, after, an, apparent, sabotage, attempt, von, braun, ordered, a, prisoner, to, be, flogged, while, robert, cazabonne, another, french, prisoner, stated, that, von, braun, stood, by, as, prisoners, were, hanged, by, chains, suspended, by, cranes, 123, 124, however, these, accounts, may, have, been, a, case, of, mistaken, identity, former, buchenwald, inmate, adam, cabala, stated, that, von, braun, went, to, the, concentration, camp, to, pick, slave, laborers, also, the, german, scientists, led, by, prof, wernher, von, braun, were, aware, of, everything, daily, as, they, went, along, the, corridors, they, saw, the, exhaustion, of, the, inmates, their, arduous, work, and, their, pain, not, one, single, time, did, prof, wernher, von, braun, protest, against, this, cruelty, during, his, frequent, stays, at, dora, even, the, aspect, of, corpses, did, not, touch, him, on, a, small, area, near, the, ambulance, shed, inmates, tortured, to, death, by, slave, labor, and, the, terror, of, the, overseers, were, piling, up, daily, but, prof, wernher, von, braun, passed, them, so, close, that, he, was, almost, touching, the, corpses, von, braun, later, stated, that, he, was, aware, of, the, treatment, of, prisoners, but, felt, helpless, to, change, the, situation, when, asked, if, von, braun, could, have, protested, against, the, brutal, treatment, of, the, slave, laborers, von, braun, team, member, konrad, dannenberg, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, since, 1932, told, the, huntsville, times, if, he, had, done, it, in, my, opinion, he, would, have, been, shot, on, the, spot, according, to, andr, sellier, a, french, historian, and, survivor, of, the, mittelbau, dora, concentration, camp, heinrich, himmler, had, von, braun, come, to, his, feldkommandostelle, hochwald, hq, in, east, prussia, in, february, 1944, to, increase, his, power, base, within, the, nazi, regime, himmler, was, conspiring, to, use, kammler, to, gain, control, of, all, german, armament, programs, including, the, v, 2, program, at, peenem, nde, 38, 40, he, therefore, recommended, that, von, braun, work, more, closely, with, kammler, to, solve, the, problems, of, the, v, 2, von, braun, stated, that, he, replied, that, the, problems, were, merely, technical, and, he, was, confident, that, they, would, be, solved, with, dornberger, s, assistance, von, braun, had, been, under, sd, surveillance, since, october, 1943, a, secret, report, stated, that, he, and, his, colleagues, klaus, riedel, and, helmut, gr, ttrup, were, said, to, have, expressed, regret, at, an, engineer, s, house, one, evening, in, early, march, 1944, that, they, were, not, working, on, a, spaceship, and, that, they, felt, the, war, was, not, going, well, this, was, considered, a, defeatist, attitude, a, young, female, dentist, who, was, an, ss, spy, reported, their, comments, himmler, s, unfounded, allegations, branding, von, braun, and, his, colleagues, as, communist, sympathizers, and, accusing, them, of, sabotaging, the, v, 2, program, coupled, with, von, braun, s, regular, piloting, of, a, government, provided, airplane, that, could, facilitate, an, escape, to, britain, led, to, their, arrest, by, the, gestapo, 38, 40, the, unsuspecting, von, braun, was, detained, on, 14, march, or, 15, march, 1944, and, was, taken, to, a, gestapo, cell, in, stettin, now, szczecin, poland, 38, 40, where, he, was, held, for, two, weeks, without, knowing, the, charges, against, him, through, major, hans, georg, klamroth, in, charge, of, the, abwehr, for, peenem, nde, dornberger, obtained, von, braun, s, conditional, release, and, albert, speer, reichsminister, for, munitions, and, war, production, persuaded, hitler, to, reinstate, von, braun, so, that, the, v, 2, program, could, continue, 38, 40, or, turn, into, a, v, 4, program, the, rheinbote, as, a, short, range, ballistic, rocket, which, in, their, view, would, be, impossible, without, von, braun, s, leadership, in, his, memoirs, speer, states, hitler, had, finally, conceded, that, von, braun, was, to, be, protected, from, all, prosecution, as, long, as, he, is, indispensable, difficult, though, the, general, consequences, arising, from, the, situation, upon, investigation, by, the, united, states, federal, bureau, of, investigation, on, 1, may, 1961, advised, that, there, was, no, record, of, an, arrest, in, their, respective, files, suggesting, that, von, braun, s, imprisonment, was, wiped, from, german, prison, records, at, a, point, after, his, conditional, release, or, after, the, nazi, regime, had, fallen, the, soviet, army, was, about, 160, km, 100, mi, from, peenem, nde, in, early, 1945, when, von, braun, assembled, his, planning, staff, and, asked, them, to, decide, how, and, to, whom, they, should, surrender, unwilling, to, go, to, the, soviets, von, braun, and, his, staff, decided, to, try, to, surrender, to, the, americans, kammler, had, ordered, the, relocation, of, his, team, to, central, germany, however, a, conflicting, order, from, an, army, chief, ordered, them, to, join, the, army, and, fight, deciding, that, kammler, s, order, was, their, best, bet, to, defect, to, the, americans, von, braun, fabricated, documents, and, transported, 500, of, his, affiliates, to, the, area, around, mittelwerk, where, they, resumed, their, work, in, bleicherode, and, surrounding, towns, after, the, middle, of, february, 1945, for, fear, of, their, documents, being, destroyed, by, the, ss, von, braun, ordered, the, blueprints, to, be, hidden, in, an, abandoned, iron, mine, in, the, harz, mountain, range, near, goslar, the, u, s, army, counter, intelligence, corps, managed, to, unveil, the, location, after, lengthy, interrogations, of, von, braun, walter, dornberger, bernhard, tessmann, and, dieter, huzel, and, recovered, 14, tons, of, v, 2, documents, by, 15, may, 1945, from, the, british, occupation, zone, while, on, an, official, trip, in, march, von, braun, suffered, a, complicated, fracture, of, his, left, arm, and, shoulder, in, a, car, accident, after, his, driver, fell, asleep, at, the, wheel, his, injuries, were, serious, but, he, insisted, that, his, arm, be, set, in, a, cast, so, that, he, could, leave, the, hospital, due, to, this, neglect, of, the, injury, he, had, to, be, hospitalized, again, a, month, later, when, his, bones, had, to, be, rebroken, and, realigned, in, early, april, as, the, allied, forces, advanced, deeper, into, germany, kammler, ordered, the, engineering, team, around, 450, specialists, to, be, moved, by, train, into, the, town, of, oberammergau, in, the, bavarian, alps, where, they, were, closely, guarded, by, the, ss, with, orders, to, execute, the, team, if, they, were, about, to, fall, into, enemy, hands, however, von, braun, managed, to, convince, ss, major, kummer, to, order, the, dispersal, of, the, group, into, nearby, villages, so, that, they, would, not, be, an, easy, target, for, u, s, bombers, on, 29, april, 1945, oberammergau, was, captured, by, the, allied, forces, who, seized, the, majority, of, the, engineering, team, nearing, the, end, of, the, war, hitler, instructed, ss, troops, to, gas, all, technical, men, concerned, with, rocket, development, upon, hearing, this, von, braun, commandeered, a, train, and, fled, with, other, technical, men, to, a, location, in, the, mountains, of, south, germany, after, some, time, von, braun, and, many, of, the, others, who, made, it, to, the, mountains, left, their, location, to, flee, to, advancing, american, lines, in, austria, von, braun, and, several, members, of, the, engineering, team, including, dornberger, made, it, to, austria, on, 2, may, 1945, upon, finding, an, american, private, from, the, u, s, 44th, infantry, division, von, braun, s, brother, and, fellow, rocket, engineer, magnus, approached, the, soldier, on, a, bicycle, calling, out, in, broken, english, my, name, is, magnus, von, braun, my, brother, invented, the, v, 2, we, want, to, surrender, after, the, surrender, wernher, von, braun, spoke, to, the, press, we, knew, that, we, had, created, a, new, means, of, warfare, and, the, question, as, to, what, nation, to, what, victorious, nation, we, were, willing, to, entrust, this, brainchild, of, ours, was, a, moral, decision, more, than, anything, else, we, wanted, to, see, the, world, spared, another, conflict, such, as, germany, had, just, been, through, and, we, felt, that, only, by, surrendering, such, a, weapon, to, people, who, are, guided, not, by, the, laws, of, materialism, but, by, christianity, and, humanity, could, such, an, assurance, to, the, world, be, best, secured, the, american, high, command, was, well, aware, of, how, important, their, catch, was, von, braun, had, been, at, the, top, of, the, black, list, the, code, name, for, the, list, of, german, scientists, and, engineers, targeted, for, immediate, interrogation, by, u, s, military, experts, on, 9, june, 1945, two, days, before, the, originally, scheduled, handover, of, the, nordhausen, and, bleicherode, area, in, thuringia, to, the, soviets, u, s, army, major, robert, b, staver, chief, of, the, jet, propulsion, section, of, the, research, and, intelligence, branch, of, the, u, s, army, ordnance, corps, in, london, and, lieutenant, colonel, r, l, williams, took, von, braun, and, his, department, chiefs, by, jeep, from, garmisch, to, munich, from, where, they, were, flown, to, nordhausen, in, the, following, days, a, larger, group, of, rocket, engineers, among, them, helmut, gr, ttrup, was, evacuated, from, bleicherode, 40, miles, 64, km, southwest, to, witzenhausen, a, small, town, in, the, american, zone, according, to, dornberger, there, the, soviets, tried, to, kidnap, von, braun, at, night, using, english, uniforms, americans, recognized, this, and, didn, t, let, them, in, von, braun, was, briefly, detained, at, the, dustbin, interrogation, center, at, kransberg, castle, where, the, elite, of, nazi, germany, s, economic, scientific, and, technological, sectors, were, debriefed, by, u, s, and, british, intelligence, officials, initially, he, was, recruited, to, the, u, s, under, a, program, called, operation, overcast, subsequently, known, as, operation, paperclip, there, is, evidence, however, that, british, intelligence, and, scientists, were, the, first, to, interview, him, in, depth, eager, to, gain, information, that, they, knew, u, s, officials, would, deny, them, the, team, included, the, young, l, s, snell, then, the, leading, british, rocket, engineer, later, chief, designer, of, rolls, royce, limited, and, inventor, of, the, concorde, s, engines, the, specific, information, the, british, gleaned, remained, top, secret, both, from, the, americans, and, from, the, other, allies, on, 20, june, 1945, u, s, secretary, of, state, edward, stettinius, jr, approved, the, transfer, of, von, braun, and, his, specialists, to, the, united, states, as, one, of, his, last, acts, in, office, this, was, announced, to, the, public, on, 1, october, 1945, in, september, 1945, von, braun, and, other, members, of, the, peenem, nde, team, signed, a, work, contract, with, the, united, states, army, ordnance, corps, on, 20, september, 1945, the, first, seven, technicians, arrived, in, the, united, states, at, new, castle, army, air, field, just, south, of, wilmington, delaware, they, were, then, flown, to, boston, massachusetts, and, taken, by, boat, to, the, army, intelligence, service, post, at, fort, strong, in, boston, harbor, later, with, the, exception, of, von, braun, the, men, were, transferred, to, aberdeen, proving, ground, in, maryland, to, sort, out, the, peenem, nde, documents, enabling, the, scientists, to, continue, their, rocketry, experiments, finally, von, braun, and, his, remaining, peenem, nde, staff, see, list, of, german, rocket, scientists, in, the, united, states, were, transferred, to, their, new, home, at, fort, bliss, a, large, army, installation, just, north, of, el, paso, texas, von, braun, later, wrote, that, he, found, it, hard, to, develop, a, genuine, emotional, attachment, to, his, new, surroundings, his, chief, design, engineer, walther, reidel, became, the, subject, of, a, december, 1946, article, german, scientist, says, american, cooking, tasteless, dislikes, rubberized, chicken, exposing, the, presence, of, von, braun, s, team, in, the, country, and, drawing, criticism, from, albert, einstein, and, john, dingell, requests, to, improve, their, living, conditions, such, as, laying, linoleum, over, their, cracked, wood, flooring, were, rejected, von, braun, was, hypercritical, of, the, slowness, of, the, united, states, development, of, guided, missiles, his, lab, was, never, able, to, get, sufficient, funds, to, go, on, with, their, programs, von, braun, remarked, at, peenem, nde, we, had, been, coddled, here, you, were, counting, pennies, whereas, von, braun, had, thousands, of, engineers, who, answered, to, him, at, peenem, nde, he, was, now, subordinate, to, pimply, 26, year, old, jim, hamill, an, army, major, who, possessed, only, an, undergraduate, degree, in, engineering, his, loyal, germans, still, addressed, him, as, herr, professor, but, hamill, addressed, him, as, wernher, and, never, responded, to, von, braun, s, request, for, more, materials, every, proposal, for, new, rocket, ideas, was, dismissed, while, at, fort, bliss, they, trained, military, industrial, and, university, personnel, in, the, intricacies, of, rockets, and, guided, missiles, as, part, of, the, hermes, project, they, helped, refurbish, assemble, and, launch, a, number, of, v, 2s, that, had, been, shipped, from, allied, occupied, germany, to, the, white, sands, proving, ground, in, new, mexico, they, also, continued, to, study, the, future, potential, of, rockets, for, military, and, research, applications, since, they, were, not, permitted, to, leave, fort, bliss, without, military, escort, von, braun, and, his, colleagues, began, to, refer, to, themselves, only, half, jokingly, as, pops, prisoners, of, peace, 218, in, 1950, at, the, start, of, the, korean, war, von, braun, and, his, team, were, transferred, to, huntsville, alabama, his, home, for, the, next, 20, years, from, 1952, to, 1956, von, braun, led, the, army, s, rocket, development, team, at, redstone, arsenal, resulting, in, the, redstone, rocket, which, was, used, for, the, first, live, nuclear, ballistic, missile, tests, conducted, by, the, united, states, he, personally, witnessed, this, historic, launch, and, detonation, work, on, the, redstone, led, to, the, development, of, the, first, high, precision, inertial, guidance, system, on, the, redstone, rocket, by, 1953, von, braun, s, title, was, chief, guided, missiles, development, division, redstone, arsenal, as, director, of, the, development, operations, division, of, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, von, braun, with, his, team, then, developed, the, jupiter, c, a, modified, redstone, rocket, the, jupiter, c, was, the, basis, for, the, juno, i, rocket, that, successfully, launched, the, west, s, first, satellite, explorer, 1, on, 31, january, 1958, this, event, signaled, the, birth, of, america, s, space, program, repeating, the, pattern, he, had, established, during, his, earlier, career, in, germany, von, braun, while, directing, military, rocket, development, in, the, real, world, continued, to, entertain, his, engineer, scientist, s, dream, of, a, future, in, which, rockets, would, be, used, for, space, exploration, however, he, was, no, longer, at, risk, of, being, fired, as, american, public, opinion, of, germans, began, to, recover, von, braun, found, himself, increasingly, in, a, position, to, popularize, his, ideas, the, 14, may, 1950, headline, of, the, huntsville, times, dr, von, braun, says, rocket, flights, possible, to, moon, might, have, marked, the, beginning, of, these, efforts, von, braun, s, ideas, rode, a, publicity, wave, that, was, created, by, science, fiction, movies, and, stories, in, 1952, von, braun, first, published, his, concept, of, a, crewed, space, station, in, a, collier, s, weekly, magazine, series, of, articles, titled, man, will, conquer, space, soon, these, articles, were, illustrated, by, the, space, artist, chesley, bonestell, and, were, influential, in, spreading, his, ideas, frequently, von, braun, worked, with, fellow, german, born, space, advocate, and, science, writer, willy, ley, to, publish, his, concepts, which, unsurprisingly, were, heavy, on, the, engineering, side, and, anticipated, many, technical, aspects, of, space, flight, that, later, became, reality, the, space, station, to, be, constructed, using, rockets, with, recoverable, and, reusable, ascent, stages, was, a, toroid, structure, with, a, diameter, of, 250, feet, 76, m, this, built, on, the, concept, of, a, rotating, wheel, shaped, station, introduced, in, 1929, by, herman, poto, nik, in, his, book, the, problem, of, space, travel, the, rocket, motor, the, space, station, spun, around, a, central, docking, nave, to, provide, artificial, gravity, and, was, assembled, in, a, 1, 075, mile, 1, 730, km, two, hour, high, inclination, earth, orbit, allowing, observation, of, essentially, every, point, on, earth, on, at, least, a, daily, basis, the, ultimate, purpose, of, the, space, station, was, to, provide, an, assembly, platform, for, crewed, lunar, expeditions, more, than, a, decade, later, the, movie, version, of, 2001, a, space, odyssey, drew, heavily, on, the, design, concept, in, its, visualization, of, an, orbital, space, station, von, braun, envisioned, these, expeditions, as, very, large, scale, undertakings, with, a, total, of, 50, astronauts, traveling, in, three, huge, spacecraft, two, for, crew, one, primarily, for, cargo, each, 49, m, 160, 76, ft, long, and, 33, m, 108, 27, ft, in, diameter, and, driven, by, a, rectangular, array, of, 30, rocket, propulsion, engines, upon, arrival, astronauts, would, establish, a, permanent, lunar, base, in, the, sinus, roris, region, by, using, the, emptied, cargo, holds, of, their, craft, as, shelters, and, would, explore, their, surroundings, for, eight, weeks, this, would, include, a, 400, km, 249, mi, expedition, in, pressurized, rovers, to, the, crater, harpalus, and, the, mare, imbrium, foothills, at, this, time, von, braun, also, worked, out, preliminary, concepts, for, a, human, mission, to, mars, that, used, the, space, station, as, a, staging, point, his, initial, plans, published, in, the, mars, project, 1952, had, envisaged, a, fleet, of, 10, spacecraft, each, with, a, mass, of, 3, 720, metric, tonnes, three, of, them, uncrewed, and, each, carrying, one, 200, tonne, winged, lander, in, addition, to, cargo, and, nine, crew, vehicles, transporting, a, total, of, 70, astronauts, the, engineering, and, astronautical, parameters, of, this, gigantic, mission, were, thoroughly, calculated, a, later, project, was, much, more, modest, using, only, one, purely, orbital, cargo, ship, and, one, crewed, craft, in, each, case, the, expedition, used, minimum, energy, hohmann, transfer, orbits, for, its, trips, to, mars, and, back, to, earth, before, technically, formalizing, his, thoughts, on, human, spaceflight, to, mars, von, braun, had, written, a, science, fiction, novel, on, the, subject, set, in, the, year, 1980, however, 18, publishers, rejected, the, manuscript, von, braun, later, published, small, portions, of, this, opus, in, magazines, to, illustrate, selected, aspects, of, his, mars, project, popularizations, the, complete, manuscript, titled, project, mars, a, technical, tale, did, not, appear, as, a, printed, book, until, december, 2006, in, the, hope, that, its, involvement, would, bring, about, greater, public, interest, in, the, future, of, the, space, program, von, braun, also, began, working, with, walt, disney, and, the, disney, studios, as, a, technical, director, initially, for, three, television, films, about, space, exploration, the, initial, broadcast, devoted, to, space, exploration, was, man, in, space, which, first, went, on, air, on, 9, march, 1955, drawing, 40, million, viewers, later, in, 1959, von, braun, published, a, short, booklet, condensed, from, episodes, that, had, appeared, in, this, week, magazine, before, describing, his, updated, concept, of, the, first, crewed, lunar, landing, the, scenario, included, only, a, single, and, relatively, small, spacecraft, a, winged, lander, with, a, crew, of, only, two, experienced, pilots, who, had, already, circumnavigated, the, moon, on, an, earlier, mission, the, brute, force, direct, ascent, flight, schedule, used, a, rocket, design, with, five, sequential, stages, loosely, based, on, the, nova, designs, that, were, under, discussion, at, this, time, after, a, night, launch, from, a, pacific, island, the, first, three, stages, brought, the, spacecraft, with, the, two, remaining, upper, stages, attached, to, terrestrial, escape, velocity, with, each, burn, creating, an, acceleration, of, 8, 9, times, standard, gravity, the, residual, propellant, in, the, third, stage, was, used, for, the, deceleration, intended, to, commence, only, a, few, hundred, kilometers, above, the, landing, site, in, a, crater, near, the, lunar, north, pole, the, fourth, stage, provided, acceleration, to, lunar, escape, velocity, and, the, fifth, stage, was, responsible, for, a, deceleration, during, return, to, the, earth, to, a, residual, speed, that, allows, aerocapture, of, the, spacecraft, ending, in, a, runway, landing, much, in, the, way, of, the, space, shuttle, one, remarkable, feature, of, this, technical, tale, is, that, the, engineer, von, braun, anticipated, a, medical, phenomenon, that, became, apparent, only, years, later, being, a, veteran, astronaut, with, no, history, of, serious, adverse, reactions, to, weightlessness, offers, no, protection, against, becoming, unexpectedly, and, violently, spacesick, in, the, first, half, of, his, life, von, braun, was, a, nonpracticing, perfunctory, lutheran, 4, 230, as, described, by, ernst, stuhlinger, and, frederick, i, ordway, iii, throughout, his, younger, years, von, braun, did, not, show, signs, of, religious, devotion, or, even, an, interest, in, things, related, to, the, church, or, to, biblical, teachings, in, fact, he, was, known, to, his, friends, as, a, merry, heathen, fr, hlicher, heide, nevertheless, in, 1945, he, explained, his, decision, to, surrender, to, the, western, allies, rather, than, russians, as, being, influenced, by, a, desire, to, share, rocket, technology, with, people, who, followed, the, bible, in, 1946, 469, he, attended, church, in, el, paso, el, paso, county, texas, and, underwent, a, religious, conversion, to, evangelical, christianity, in, an, unnamed, religious, magazine, he, stated, one, day, in, fort, bliss, a, neighbor, called, and, asked, if, i, would, like, to, go, to, church, with, him, i, accepted, because, i, wanted, to, see, if, the, american, church, was, just, a, country, club, as, i, d, been, led, to, expect, instead, i, found, a, small, white, frame, building, in, the, hot, texas, sun, on, a, browned, grass, lot, together, these, people, make, a, live, vibrant, community, this, was, the, first, time, i, really, understood, that, religion, was, not, a, cathedral, inherited, from, the, past, or, a, quick, prayer, at, the, last, minute, to, be, effective, a, religion, has, to, be, backed, up, by, discipline, and, effort, 229, 230, on, the, motives, behind, this, conversion, michael, j, neufeld, is, of, the, opinion, that, he, turned, to, religion, to, pacify, his, own, conscience, and, university, of, southampton, scholar, kendrick, oliver, said, that, von, braun, was, presumably, moved, by, a, desire, to, find, a, new, direction, for, his, life, after, the, moral, chaos, of, his, service, for, the, third, reich, having, concluded, one, bad, bargain, with, the, devil, perhaps, now, he, felt, a, need, to, have, god, securely, at, his, side, at, a, gideons, conference, in, 2004, w, albert, wilson, a, former, pilot, and, nasa, employee, stated, that, he, had, talked, with, von, braun, about, the, christian, faith, while, von, braun, was, working, for, nasa, and, believed, that, conversation, had, been, instrumental, in, von, braun, s, conversion, later, in, life, he, joined, an, episcopal, congregation, and, became, increasingly, religious, he, publicly, spoke, and, wrote, about, the, complementarity, of, science, and, religion, the, afterlife, of, the, soul, and, his, belief, in, god, he, stated, through, science, man, strives, to, learn, more, of, the, mysteries, of, creation, through, religion, he, seeks, to, know, the, creator, he, was, interviewed, by, the, assemblies, of, god, pastor, c, m, ward, and, stated, that, the, farther, we, probe, into, space, the, greater, my, faith, in, addition, he, met, privately, with, evangelist, billy, graham, and, with, the, civil, rights, leader, martin, luther, king, jr, von, braun, developed, and, published, his, space, station, concept, during, the, time, of, the, cold, war, when, the, u, s, government, put, the, containment, of, the, soviet, union, above, everything, else, the, fact, that, his, space, station, if, armed, with, missiles, that, could, be, easily, adapted, from, those, already, available, at, this, time, would, give, the, united, states, space, superiority, in, both, orbital, and, orbit, to, ground, warfare, did, not, escape, him, in, his, popular, writings, von, braun, elaborated, on, them, in, several, of, his, books, and, articles, but, he, took, care, to, qualify, such, military, applications, as, particularly, dreadful, this, much, less, peaceful, aspect, of, von, braun, s, drive, for, space, has, been, reviewed, by, michael, j, neufeld, from, the, space, history, division, of, the, national, air, and, space, museum, in, washington, the, u, s, navy, had, been, tasked, with, building, a, rocket, to, lift, satellites, into, orbit, but, the, resulting, vanguard, rocket, launch, system, was, unreliable, in, 1957, with, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, a, belief, grew, within, the, united, states, that, it, lagged, behind, the, soviet, union, in, the, emerging, space, race, american, authorities, then, chose, to, use, von, braun, and, his, german, team, s, experience, with, missiles, to, create, an, orbital, launch, vehicle, von, braun, had, originally, proposed, such, an, idea, in, 1954, but, it, was, denied, at, the, time, nasa, was, established, by, law, on, 29, july, 1958, one, day, later, the, 50th, redstone, rocket, was, successfully, launched, from, johnston, atoll, in, the, south, pacific, as, part, of, operation, hardtack, i, two, years, later, nasa, opened, the, marshall, space, flight, center, at, redstone, arsenal, in, huntsville, and, the, army, ballistic, missile, agency, abma, development, team, led, by, von, braun, was, transferred, to, nasa, in, a, face, to, face, meeting, with, herb, york, at, the, pentagon, von, braun, made, it, clear, he, would, go, to, nasa, only, if, development, of, the, saturn, were, allowed, to, continue, von, braun, became, the, center, s, first, director, on, 1, july, 1960, and, held, the, position, until, 27, january, 1970, von, braun, s, early, years, at, nasa, included, a, failed, 4, inch, mission, on, 21, november, 1960, during, which, the, first, uncrewed, mercury, redstone, rocket, the, rocket, only, rose, up, a, mere, 4, inches, before, settling, back, down, onto, the, launch, pad, the, unfortunate, and, untimely, failure, of, the, rocket, launch, created, a, nadir, of, morale, in, project, mercury, the, launch, failure, was, later, determined, to, be, the, result, of, a, power, plug, with, one, prong, shorter, than, the, other, because, a, worker, filed, it, to, make, it, fit, because, of, the, difference, in, the, length, of, one, prong, the, launch, system, detected, the, difference, in, the, power, disconnection, as, a, cut, off, signal, to, the, engine, the, safety, system, in, fact, stopped, the, launch, after, the, success, of, the, mercury, redstone, 2, mission, in, january, 1961, a, mere, 2, months, after, the, failed, 4, inch, mission, nasa, morale, was, improved, still, a, new, string, of, problems, emerged, von, braun, insisted, on, one, more, test, before, the, redstone, could, be, deemed, man, rated, his, overly, cautious, nature, brought, about, clashes, with, other, people, involved, in, the, program, who, argued, that, mr, 2, s, technical, issues, were, simple, and, had, been, resolved, shortly, after, the, flight, he, overruled, them, so, a, test, mission, involving, a, redstone, on, a, boilerplate, capsule, was, flown, successfully, in, march, von, braun, s, stubbornness, was, blamed, for, the, inability, of, the, u, s, to, launch, a, crewed, space, mission, before, the, soviet, union, which, ended, up, putting, the, first, man, in, space, the, following, month, three, weeks, later, on, 5, may, von, braun, s, team, successfully, launched, alan, shepard, into, space, he, named, his, mercury, redstone, 3, freedom, 7, the, marshall, center, s, first, major, program, was, the, development, of, saturn, rockets, to, carry, heavy, payloads, into, and, beyond, earth, orbit, from, this, the, apollo, program, for, crewed, moon, flights, was, developed, von, braun, initially, pushed, for, a, flight, engineering, concept, that, called, for, an, earth, orbit, rendezvous, technique, the, approach, he, had, argued, for, building, his, space, station, but, in, 1962, he, converted, to, the, lunar, orbit, rendezvous, concept, that, was, subsequently, realized, during, apollo, he, worked, closely, with, former, peenem, nde, teammate, kurt, h, debus, the, first, director, of, the, kennedy, space, center, his, dream, to, help, mankind, set, foot, on, the, moon, became, a, reality, on, 16, july, 1969, when, a, marshall, developed, saturn, v, rocket, launched, the, crew, of, apollo, 11, on, its, historic, eight, day, mission, over, the, course, of, the, program, saturn, v, rockets, enabled, six, teams, of, astronauts, to, reach, the, surface, of, the, moon, during, the, late, 1960s, von, braun, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, the, u, s, space, and, rocket, center, in, huntsville, the, desk, from, which, he, guided, america, s, entry, into, the, space, race, remains, on, display, there, he, also, was, instrumental, in, the, launching, of, the, experimental, applications, technology, satellite, he, traveled, to, india, and, hoped, that, the, program, would, be, helpful, in, bringing, a, massive, educational, television, project, to, help, the, poorest, people, in, that, country, during, the, local, summer, of, 1966, 67, von, braun, participated, in, a, field, trip, to, antarctica, organized, for, him, and, several, other, members, of, top, nasa, management, the, goal, of, the, field, trip, was, to, determine, whether, the, experience, gained, by, the, u, s, scientific, and, technological, community, during, the, exploration, of, antarctic, wastelands, would, be, useful, for, the, crewed, exploration, of, space, von, braun, was, mainly, interested, in, the, management, of, the, scientific, effort, on, antarctic, research, stations, logistics, habitation, and, life, support, and, in, using, the, barren, antarctic, terrain, like, the, glacial, dry, valleys, to, test, the, equipment, that, one, day, was, used, to, look, for, signs, of, life, on, mars, and, other, worlds, in, an, internal, memo, dated, 16, january, 1969, von, braun, had, confirmed, to, his, staff, that, he, would, stay, on, as, a, center, director, at, huntsville, to, head, the, apollo, applications, program, he, referred, to, this, time, as, a, moment, in, his, life, when, he, felt, the, strong, need, to, pray, stating, i, certainly, prayed, a, lot, before, and, during, the, crucial, apollo, flights, a, few, months, later, on, the, occasion, of, the, first, moon, landing, he, publicly, expressed, his, optimism, that, the, saturn, v, carrier, system, would, continue, to, be, developed, advocating, human, missions, to, mars, in, the, 1980s, nonetheless, on, 1, march, 1970, von, braun, and, his, family, relocated, to, washington, d, c, when, he, was, assigned, the, post, of, nasa, s, deputy, associate, administrator, for, planning, at, nasa, headquarters, after, a, series, of, conflicts, associated, with, the, truncation, of, the, apollo, program, and, facing, severe, budget, constraints, von, braun, retired, from, nasa, on, 26, may, 1972, not, only, had, it, become, evident, by, this, time, that, nasa, and, his, visions, for, future, u, s, space, flight, projects, were, incompatible, but, also, it, was, perhaps, even, more, frustrating, for, him, to, see, popular, support, for, a, continued, presence, of, man, in, space, wane, dramatically, once, the, goal, to, reach, the, moon, had, been, accomplished, von, braun, also, developed, the, idea, of, a, space, camp, that, would, train, children, in, fields, of, science, and, space, technologies, as, well, as, help, their, mental, development, much, the, same, way, sports, camps, aim, at, improving, physical, development, 354, 355, after, leaving, nasa, von, braun, moved, to, the, washington, d, c, area, and, became, vice, president, for, engineering, and, development, at, the, aerospace, company, fairchild, industries, in, germantown, maryland, on, 1, july, 1972, in, 1973, during, a, routine, physical, examination, von, braun, was, diagnosed, with, kidney, cancer, which, could, not, be, controlled, with, the, medical, techniques, available, at, the, time, von, braun, helped, establish, and, promote, the, national, space, institute, a, precursor, of, the, present, day, national, space, society, in, 1975, and, became, its, first, president, and, chairman, in, 1976, he, became, a, scientific, consultant, to, lutz, kayser, the, ceo, of, otrag, and, a, member, of, the, daimler, benz, board, of, directors, however, his, deteriorating, health, forced, him, to, retire, from, fairchild, on, 31, december, 1976, when, the, 1975, national, medal, of, science, was, awarded, to, him, in, early, 1977, he, had, been, hospitalized, and, was, unable, to, attend, the, white, house, ceremony, von, braun, s, insistence, on, more, tests, after, mercury, redstone, 2, flew, higher, than, planned, has, been, identified, as, contributing, to, the, soviet, union, s, success, in, launching, the, first, human, in, space, the, successful, mercury, redstone, bd, flight, took, the, launch, slot, that, might, have, put, alan, shepard, into, space, three, weeks, ahead, of, yuri, gagarin, his, soviet, counterpart, sergei, korolev, insisted, on, two, successful, flights, with, dogs, before, risking, gagarin, s, life, on, a, crewed, attempt, the, second, test, flight, took, place, one, day, after, the, mercury, redstone, bd, mission, von, braun, took, a, conservative, approach, to, engineering, designing, with, ample, safety, factors, and, redundant, structure, this, became, a, point, of, contention, with, other, engineers, who, struggled, to, keep, vehicle, weight, down, so, that, payload, could, be, maximized, as, noted, above, his, caution, likely, led, to, the, u, s, losing, the, race, to, put, a, man, into, space, before, the, soviets, krafft, ehricke, likened, von, braun, s, approach, to, building, the, brooklyn, bridge, 208, many, at, nasa, headquarters, jokingly, referred, to, marshall, as, the, chicago, bridge, and, iron, works, but, acknowledged, that, the, designs, worked, the, conservative, approach, paid, off, when, a, fifth, engine, was, added, to, the, saturn, c, 4, producing, the, saturn, v, the, c, 4, design, had, a, large, crossbeam, that, could, easily, absorb, the, thrust, of, an, additional, engine, 371, von, braun, did, not, indicate, interest, in, politics, or, political, philosophy, during, his, onboarding, working, for, the, u, s, army, he, was, primarily, focused, on, his, work, in, guided, missiles, for, the, purpose, of, advancing, science, and, technology, according, to, fbi, background, checks, any, political, activity, he, may, have, engaged, in, was, a, means, to, an, end, to, provide, him, with, the, necessary, freedom, to, conduct, his, experiments, this, included, time, spent, in, the, nazi, party, during, world, war, 2, during, his, time, in, nasa, he, opposed, racial, segregation, which, brought, him, into, conflict, with, george, wallace, who, advocated, racial, discrimination, in, alabama, and, wanted, to, continue, segregation, von, braun, accused, segregationist, policies, as, obstructing, the, development, of, alabama, his, statements, were, considered, unusual, for, a, space, scientist, particularly, in, the, south, but, well, within, agency, and, national, policy, von, braun, had, a, charismatic, personality, and, was, known, as, a, ladies, man, as, a, student, in, berlin, he, often, was, seen, in, the, evenings, in, the, company, of, two, girlfriends, at, once, 63, he, later, had, a, succession, of, affairs, within, the, secretarial, and, computer, pool, at, peenem, nde, 92, 94, in, january, 1943, von, braun, became, engaged, to, dorothee, brill, a, physical, education, teacher, in, berlin, and, he, sought, permission, to, marry, from, the, ss, race, and, settlement, main, office, however, the, engagement, was, broken, due, to, his, mother, s, opposition, 146, 147, later, in, 1943, he, had, an, affair, with, a, french, woman, while, in, paris, preparing, v, 2, launch, sites, in, northeastern, france, she, was, imprisoned, for, collaboration, after, the, war, and, became, destitute, 147, 148, during, his, stay, at, fort, bliss, von, braun, proposed, marriage, to, maria, luise, von, quistorp, his, maternal, first, cousin, in, a, letter, to, his, father, he, married, her, in, a, lutheran, church, in, landshut, bavaria, on, 1, march, 1947, having, received, permission, to, go, back, to, germany, and, return, with, his, bride, he, was, 35, and, his, new, bride, was, 18, shortly, after, he, converted, to, evangelicalism, he, returned, to, manhattan, on, 26, march, 1947, with, his, wife, father, and, mother, on, 8, december, 1948, the, von, brauns, first, daughter,

1955, von, braun, became, a, naturalized, citizen, of, the, united, states, in, 1973, von, braun, was, diagnosed, with, kidney, cancer, during, a, routine, medical, examination, however, he, continued, to, work, unrestrained, for, a, number, of, years, in, january, 1977, then, very, ill, he, resigned, from, fairchild, industries, later, in, 1977, president, gerald, r, ford, awarded, him, the, country, s, highest, science, honor, the, national, medal, of, science, in, engineering, he, was, too, ill, to, attend, the, white, house, ceremony, von, braun, died, on, 16, june, 1977, of,
