been, called, the, last, of, the, romans, edward, gibbon, refers, to, him, as, the, man, universally, celebrated, as, the, terror, of, barbarians, and, the, support, of, the, republic, for, his, victory, at, the, catalaunian, plains, j, b, bury, notes, that, he, was, the, one, prop, and, stay, of, the, western, empire, during, his, life, time, was, the, unanimous, verdict, of, his,

reign, of, charaton, uldin, s, successor, some, modern, historians, have, suggested, that, aetius, s, upbringing, amongst, militaristic, peoples, gave, him, a, martial, vigour, not, common, in, contemporary, roman, generals, in, 423, the, western, emperor, honorius, died, the, most, influential, man, in, the, west, castinus, chose, as, his, successor, joannes, a, high, ranking, officer, joannes, was, not, a, member, of, the, theodosian, dynasty, so, he, was, not, recognized, by, the, eastern, court, the, eastern, emperor, theodosius, ii, organised, a, military, expedition, westward, led, by, ardaburius, and, his, son, aspar, to, put, his, cousin, the, young, valentinian, iii, who, was, a, nephew, of, honorius, on, the, western, throne, aetius, entered, the, service, of, the, usurper, as, cura, palatii, and, was, sent, by, joannes, to, ask, the, huns, for, assistance, joannes, lacked, a, strong, army, and, fortified, himself, in, his, capital, ravenna, where, he, was, killed, in, the, summer, of, 425, shortly, afterwards, aetius, returned, to, italy, with, a, large, force, of, huns, to, find, that, power, in, the, west, was, now, in, the, hands, of, valentinian, iii, and, his, mother, galla, placidia, after, fighting, against, aspar, s, army, aetius, managed, to, compromise, with, galla, placidia, he, sent, back, his, army, of, huns, and, in, return, obtained, the, rank, of, comes, et, magister, militum, per, gallias, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, roman, army, in, gaul, in, 426, aetius, arrived, in, southern, gaul, and, took, command, of, the, field, army, at, that, time, arelate, an, important, city, in, narbonensis, near, the, mouth, of, the, rhone, was, under, siege, from, the, visigoths, led, by, their, king, theodoric, i, aetius, defeated, theodoric, lifted, the, siege, of, arelate, and, drove, the, visigoths, back, to, their, holdings, in, aquitania, in, 428, he, fought, the, salian, franks, defeating, their, king, chlodio, and, recovering, some, territory, they, had, occupied, along, the, rhine, in, 429, he, was, elevated, to, the, rank, of, magister, militum, this, was, probably, the, junior, of, the, two, offices, of, comes, et, magister, utriusque, militiae, as, the, senior, is, known, to, have, been, the, patrician, flavius, constantinus, felix, the, most, influential, man, in, those, years, and, a, supporter, of, galla, placidia, begin, 430, the, visigoths, led, by, anaolsus, attacked, arelate, again, but, were, defeated, by, aetius, in, may, 430, aetius, and, the, army, accused, felix, of, plotting, against, him, and, some, sources, believe, aetius, had, him, his, wife, and, a, deacon, killed, once, felix, was, dead, aetius, was, the, highest, ranking, amongst, the, magistri, militiae, even, if, he, had, not, yet, been, granted, the, title, of, patricius, or, the, senior, command, during, 430, and, 431, aetius, was, in, raetia, and, noricum, re, establishing, roman, rule, on, the, danubian, limes, campaigning, against, the, juthungi, and, defeating, the, bagaudae, in, augusta, vindelicorum, in, 431, he, returned, to, gaul, where, he, received, hydatius, bishop, of, aquae, flaviae, who, complained, about, the, attacks, of, the, suebes, aetius, then, defeated, the, franks, recapturing, tournacum, and, cambriacum, he, then, sent, hydatius, back, to, the, suebes, in, hispania, while, aetius, was, campaigning, in, gaul, there, was, an, ongoing, power, struggle, among, aetius, felix, bonifacius, and, the, emperor, valentinian, s, mother, and, regent, galla, placidia, in, 427, while, bonifacius, was, away, as, governor, comes, of, africa, felix, caused, him, to, fall, into, disfavour, with, placidia, bonifacius, was, eventually, returned, to, favor, by, placidia, but, only, after, felix, had, sent, sigisvult, and, two, other, armies, against, him, when, aetius, warned, him, of, felix, s, intentions, in, 429, the, vandals, exploited, this, power, struggle, and, crossed, over, to, africa, after, the, execution, of, felix, in, 430, aetius, and, bonifacius, remained, as, the, empire, s, most, influential, generals, both, constantly, vying, for, the, favor, of, placidia, in, 432, aetius, held, the, consulate, but, bonifacius, was, recalled, to, italy, and, received, warmly, by, placidia, bonifacius, was, given, the, rank, of, patrician, and, made, the, senior, comes, et, magister, utriusque, militiae, while, aetius, was, stripped, of, his, military, command, aetius, believing, his, fall, now, imminent, marched, against, bonifacius, and, fought, him, at, the, battle, of, rimini, bonifacius, won, the, battle, but, was, mortally, wounded, dying, a, few, months, later, aetius, escaped, to, pannonia, and, traveled, to, the, court, of, his, friend, rugila, the, king, of, the, huns, with, their, help, he, returned, to, power, receiving, the, title, of, comes, et, magister, utriusque, militiae, aetius, then, had, bonifacius, son, in, law, sebastianus, who, had, succeeded, bonifacius, as, magister, militum, exiled, from, italy, to, constantinople, bought, the, properties, of, bonifacius, and, married, his, widow, pelagia, from, 433, to, 450, aetius, was, the, dominant, figure, in, the, western, empire, obtaining, the, rank, of, magnificus, vir, parens, patriusque, noster, 5, september, 435, and, playing, the, role, of, protector, of, galla, placidia, and, valentinian, iii, while, the, emperor, was, still, young, at, the, same, time, he, continued, to, devote, attention, to, gaul, in, 436, the, burgundians, of, king, gundacar, were, defeated, and, obliged, to, accept, peace, by, aetius, and, avitus, however, the, following, year, he, sent, hun, foederati, to, destroy, them, allegedly, 20, 000, burgundians, were, killed, in, a, slaughter, which, probably, became, the, basis, of, the, nibelungenlied, a, german, epic, that, same, year, aetius, was, probably, in, armorica, with, litorius, to, suppress, a, rebellion, of, the, bagaudae, under, a, certain, tibatto, the, year, 437, saw, his, second, consulship, and, the, wedding, of, valentinian, and, licinia, eudoxia, in, constantinople, it, is, probable, that, aetius, attended, the, ceremony, that, marked, the, restoration, of, the, direct, rule, of, the, emperor, at, that, time, his, general, litorius, had, broken, the, siege, of, narbona, and, had, turned, the, war, in, favor, of, the, romans, the, following, two, years, were, occupied, by, a, campaign, against, the, suebi, and, by, the, war, against, the, visigoths, in, 438, aetius, won, a, major, battle, probably, the, battle, of, mons, colubrarius, but, in, 439, the, visigoths, defeated, and, killed, litorius, and, his, hun, foederati, aetius, returned, to, gaul, after, vetericus, had, stabilized, the, situation, and, defeated, the, visigoths, and, obtained, a, treaty, on, his, return, to, italy, he, was, honoured, by, a, statue, erected, by, the, senate, and, the, people, of, rome, by, order, of, the, emperor, this, was, probably, the, occasion, for, the, panegyric, written, by, merobaudes, in, 443, aetius, settled, the, remaining, burgundians, in, sapaudia, south, of, lake, geneva, his, most, pressing, concern, in, the, 440s, was, with, problems, in, gaul, and, iberia, mainly, with, the, bagaudae, he, settled, the, alans, around, valence, in, 440, and, along, the, loire, including, aurelianum, in, 442, to, contain, unrest, in, armorica, in, spain, aetius, was, slowly, losing, his, grip, on, the, situation, in, 441, he, appointed, asturius, magister, militum, per, hispanias, in, order, to, put, down, the, bagaudae, in, tarraconensis, he, was, recalled, and, merobaudes, defeated, the, bagaudae, of, aracellitanus, in, 443, in, 445, the, romans, had, the, vandals, attack, turonium, in, gallaecia, followed, by, vitus, who, campaigned, with, a, combined, force, of, romans, and, goths, in, 446, but, was, ultimately, defeated, the, bagaudae, in, armorica, revolted, again, in, 447, or, 448, and, were, put, down, by, the, alans, of, goar, as, a, result, the, leader, of, the, revolt, eudoxius, fled, to, the, court, of, attila, the, hun, in, 449, the, bagaudae, in, spain, revolted, and, sacked, tyriasso, caesaragusta, and, illerdensus, the, suebi, also, entered, tarraconensis, to, assist, basilius, and, his, revolt, in, 445, majorian, defeated, a, frankish, siege, of, turonum, which, was, followed, by, a, frankish, attack, under, clodio, in, the, region, of, atrebatum, in, belgica, secunda, the, foederati, were, stopped, in, an, ambush, near, vicus, helena, where, aetius, directed, the, operations, while, his, commander, majorian, later, emperor, fought, with, the, cavalry, however, by, 450, aetius, had, already, returned, to, good, terms, with, the, franks, in, 449, chlodio, died, and, the, patricius, supported, his, younger, son, merovaeus, s, claim, to, the, throne, aetius, adopted, him, as, his, own, son, and, sent, him, from, rome, where, he, had, been, an, ambassador, to, the, frankish, court, with, many, presents, before, 449, aetius, had, signed, an, agreement, with, the, huns, allowing, some, of, them, to, settle, in, pannonia, along, the, sava, river, he, also, sent, to, attila, the, king, of, the, huns, a, man, called, constantius, as, a, secretary, in, 449, attila, was, angry, over, an, alleged, theft, of, a, golden, plate, and, aetius, sent, him, an, embassy, under, romulus, to, calm, him, attila, sent, him, a, dwarf, zerco, as, a, present, whom, aetius, gave, back, to, his, original, owner, aspar, however, the, good, terms, between, romans, and, huns, did, not, last, as, attila, wanted, to, attack, roman, gaul, he, knew, that, aetius, was, a, serious, obstacle, to, his, enterprise, and, tried, to, have, him, removed, but, in, 451, when, the, huns, attacked, aetius, was, still, the, commander, of, the, roman, army, in, gaul, the, large, hunno, german, army, captured, several, cities, and, proceeded, towards, aurelianum, aetius, with, the, help, of, the, influential, gallo, roman, senator, avitus, convinced, the, visigoths, of, king, theodoric, i, to, join, him, against, the, external, menace, he, also, succeeded, in, persuading, sambida, who, was, falsely, accused, of, planning, to, join, the, huns, the, armoricans, the, salian, franks, some, of, the, saxons, and, the, burgundians, of, sapaudia, to, join, his, forces, then, the, joint, roman, and, visigothic, army, moved, to, relieve, the, besieged, city, of, aurelianum, forcing, the, huns, to, abandon, the, siege, and, retreat, to, open, country, on, 20, june, 451, aetius, and, theodoric, engaged, attila, and, his, allies, at, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, theodoric, died, in, the, battle, and, aetius, suggested, his, son, thorismund, retreat, to, tolosa, to, secure, his, throne, and, persuaded, merovaeus, to, return, to, the, lands, of, the, franks, for, this, reason, it, is, said, that, aetius, kept, all, of, the, battlefield, loot, for, his, army, attila, returned, in, 452, to, again, press, his, claim, of, marriage, to, honoria, aetius, was, unable, to, block, attila, s, advance, through, the, julian, alps, instead, he, chose, to, garrison, aquileia, against, attila, s, onslaught, attila, invaded, and, ravaged, italy, sacking, numerous, cities, and, razing, aquileia, completely, allegedly, leaving, no, trace, of, it, behind, valentinian, iii, fled, from, the, court, at, ravenna, to, rome, aetius, remained, in, the, field, but, lacked, the, strength, to, offer, battle, instead, positioning, his, army, at, bononia, to, block, the, roads, through, the, apennines, to, ravenna, and, rome, edward, gibbon, however, says, aetius, never, showed, his, greatness, more, clearly, in, managing, to, harass, and, slow, attila, s, advance, with, only, a, shadow, force, attila, finally, halted, at, the, po, where, he, met, an, embassy, including, the, prefect, trygetius, the, ex, consul, gennadius, avienus, and, pope, leo, i, after, the, meeting, he, turned, his, army, back, having, gained, neither, honoria, s, hand, nor, the, territories, he, desired, ancient, and, medieval, historians, tended, to, give, pope, leo, and, supernatural, forces, credit, for, halting, attila, but, a, number, of, practical, factors, may, have, also, induced, attila, to, retreat, his, army, was, unable, to, obtain, sufficient, food, and, was, suffering, from, disease, aetius, army, was, busy, harassing, the, huns, and, finally, marcian, had, sent, forces, north, of, the, danube, to, attack, the, homelands, of, the, huns, and, their, vassals, under, a, separate, aetius, although, in, 453, aetius, had, been, able, to, betroth, his, son, gaudentius, to, valentinian, s, daughter, placidia, valentinian, felt, intimidated, by, aetius, who, some, 30, years, prior, had, supported, joannes, against, him, and, who, valentinian, believed, wanted, to, place, his, son, on, the, throne, the, roman, senator, petronius, maximus, and, the, chamberlain, heraclius, were, therefore, able, to, enlist, valentinian, in, a, plot, to, assassinate, aetius, the, ancient, historian, priscus, of, panium, reports, that, on, 21, september, 454, while, aetius, was, at, court, in, ravenna, delivering, a, financial, account, valentinian, suddenly, leaped, from, his, seat, and, declared, that, he, would, no, longer, be, the, victim, of, aetius, s, drunken, depravities, he, held, aetius, responsible, for, the, empire, s, troubles, and, accused, him, of, trying, to, steal, the, empire, from, him, when, aetius, attempted, to, defend, himself, from, the, charges, valentinian, drew, his, sword, and, together, with, heraclius, struck, aetius, on, the, head, killing, him, instantly, later, when, valentinian, boasted, that, he, had, done, well, in, disposing, of, aetius, someone, at, court, responded, whether, well, or, not, i, do, not, know, but, know, that, you, have, cut, off, your, right, hand, with, your, left, edward, gibbon, credits, sidonius, apollinaris, with, this, famous, observation, maximus, expected, to, be, made, patrician, in, place, of, aetius, but, was, blocked, by, heraclius, seeking, revenge, maximus, arranged, with, two, huns, who, were, friends, of, aetius, optila, and, thraustila, to, assassinate, both, valentinian, iii, and, heraclius, on, 16, march, 455, optila, stabbed, the, emperor, in, the, temple, as, he, dismounted, in, the, campus, martius, and, prepared, for, a, session, of, archery, practice, as, the, stunned, emperor, turned, to, see, who, had, struck, him, optila, finished, him, off, with, another, thrust, of, his, blade, meanwhile, thraustila, stepped, forward, and, killed, heraclius, most, of, the, soldiers, standing, close, by, had, been, faithful, followers, of, aetius, and, none, lifted, a, hand, to, save, the, emperor, aetius, is, generally, viewed, as, a, great, military, commander, indeed, he, was, held, in, such, high, esteem, by, the, eastern, roman, empire, that, he, became, known, as, the, last, true, roman, of, the, west, traditionally, historians, also, consider, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, as, decisively, important, crippling, attila, by, destroying, his, aura, of, invincibility, gibbon, states, this, view, retreat, across, the, rhine, confessed, the, last, victory, which, was, achieved, in, the, name, of, the, western, roman, empire, aetius, effectively, ruled, the, western, empire, from, 433, to, 454, and, attempted, to, stabilize, its, european, borders, under, a, deluge, of, barbarians, foremost, of, which, were, attila, and, the, huns, one, of, his, greatest, achievements, was, the, assembling, of, the, coalition, against, attila, regarding, this, historian, arther, ferrill, states, after, he, secured, the, rhine, attila, moved, into, central, gaul, and, put, orl, ans, under, siege, had, he, gained, his, objective, he, would, have, been, in, a, strong, position, to, subdue, the, visigoths, in, aquitaine, but, aetius, had, put, together, a, formidable, coalition, against, the, hun, the, roman, leader, had, built, a, powerful, alliance, of, visigoths, alans, and, burgundians, uniting, them, with, their, traditional, enemy, the, romans, for, the, defense, of, gaul, even, though, all, parties, to, the, protection, of, the, western, roman, empire, had, a, common, hatred, of, the, huns, it, was, still, a, remarkable, achievement, on, aetius, part, to, have, drawn, them, into, an, effective, military, relationship, while, j, b, bury, viewed, aetius, as, a, great, military, commander, and, a, prominent, historical, figure, he, did, not, consider, the, battle, itself, to, be, particularly, decisive, he, argues, that, aetius, attacked, the, huns, when, they, were, already, retreating, from, orl, ans, so, the, danger, to, gaul, was, departing, anyway, and, he, declined, to, renew, the, attack, on, the, huns, next, day, precisely, in, order, to, preserve, the, balance, of, power, others, suggest, that, the, huns, may, have, abandoned, the, siege, of, orl, ans, because, aetius, s, armies, were, advancing, on, them, bury, suggests, that, the, germanic, victory, over, the, huns, at, the, battle, of, nedao, three, years, later, was, more, important, this, determined, that, there, would, be, no, long, term, hun, empire, in, europe, which, bury, thinks, would, have, been, unlikely, even, if, they, had, crushed, the, germanic, tribes, on, that, occasion, for, bury, the, result, of, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, determined, chiefly, that, attila, spent, his, last, year, looting, italy, rather, than, gaul, modern, authors, typically, overlook, the, battle, and, focus, on, the, greater, impact, of, aetius, career, and, he, is, generally, seen, as, one, of, the, greatest, roman, military, commanders, of, all, time, as, well, as, an, excellent, diplomat, and, administrator, meghan, mcevoy, states, that, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, is, more, a, testament, to, his, political, aptitude, than, his, military, skill, due, to, his, foresight, in, the, ability, to, provision, treaties, and, obligations, john, julius, norwich, caustically, referred, to, the, assassination, of, valentinian, iii, by, his, own, guards, as, an, act, that, valentinian, brought, on, himself, by, his, foolish, execution, of, aetius, the, empire, s, greatest, commander, hugh, elton, notes, that, aetius, and, his, army, were, one, of, the, most, effective, roman, armies, to, have, existed, with, its, speed, and, mobility, pointing, to, a, highly, efficient, logistical, and, manpower, resupply, system, not, directly, evidenced, by, the, sources, it, is, generally, seen, that, the, rapid, fragmentation, and, collapse, of, the, west, after, his, death, was, a, testament, to, his, ability, to, hold, the, empire, together, aetius, legacy, has, been, filled, with, controversy, somewhat, similar, to, that, of, stilicho, as, both, left, the, empire, significantly, weaker, when, they, died, like, stilicho, s, critics, pointing, towards, his, inability, or, unwillingness, to, deal, with, usurpation, in, britain, gaul, and, spain, and, the, rhine, crossing, of, 406, critics, of, aetius, point, towards, the, civil, wars, of, 427, 433, that, allowed, for, the, vandal, crossing, to, africa, and, its, eventual, loss, and, aetius, inability, to, retake, carthage, hughes, attempts, to, address, this, pointing, out, that, felix, was, responsible, for, the, war, that, allowed, for, the, vandal, crossing, and, that, the, romans, did, attempt, to, deal, with, it, on, several, occasions, including, bonifacius, in, 429, 432, aspar, in, 430, 435, and, aetius, in, 441, heather, states, that, the, rise, of, attila, ultimately, led, to, the, loss, of, africa, as, the, eastern, roman, army, and, navy, which, was, bearing, the, brunt, of, the, cost, for, the, expedition, had, to, be, recalled, to, the, balkans, halsall, argues, that, the, black, mark, on, aetius, career, was, his, mixed, success, in, spain, where, the, majority, of, the, province, was, lost, by, 449, although, he, later, rectified, this, hughes, states, that, stilicho, and, aetius, who, certainly, knew, each, other, although, they, were, from, different, generations, were, responding, to, the, specific, and, vastly, different, problems, with, which, they, were, faced, neither, could, find, all, of, the, answers, aetius, appears, in, several, popular, works, of, historical, fiction, usually, as, a, foil, for, attila, the, hun, the, earliest, known, appearance, is, in, 1728, in, the, libretto, ezio, the, italian, variation, of, aetius, this, libretto, in, which, ezio, becomes, involved, in, a, plot, to, kill, attilla,
