sir, humphry, davy, 1st, baronet, frs, mria, fgs, 17, december, 1778, 29, may, 1829, was, a, british, chemist, and, inventor, who, invented, the, davy, lamp, and, a, very, early, form, of, arc, lamp, he, is, also, remembered, for, isolating, by, using, electricity, several, elements, for, the, first, time, potassium, and, sodium, in, 1807, and, calcium, strontium, barium, magnesium, and, boron, the, following, year, as, well, as, for, discovering, the, elemental, nature, of, chlorine, and, iodine, davy, also, studied, the, forces, involved, in, these, separations, inventing, the, new, field, of, electrochemistry, davy, is, also, credited, with, discovering, clathrate, hydrates, in, 1799, he, experimented, with, nitrous, oxide, and, was, astonished, at, how, it, made, him, laugh, he, nicknamed, it, laughing, gas, and, wrote, about, its, potential, as, an, anaesthetic, to, relieve, pain, during, surgery, davy, was, a, baronet, president, of, the, royal, society, prs, member, of, the, royal, irish, academy, mria, fellow, of, the, geological, society, fgs, and, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, elected, 1810, berzelius, called, davy, s, 1806, bakerian, lecture, on, some, chemical, agencies, of, electricity, one, of, the, best, memoirs, which, has, ever, enriched, the, theory, of, chemistry, davy, was, born, in, penzance, cornwall, in, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, on, 17, december, 1778, the, eldest, of, the, five, children, of, robert, davy, a, woodcarver, and, his, wife, grace, millett, according, to, his, brother, and, fellow, chemist, john, davy, their, hometown, was, characterised, by, an, almost, unbounded, credulity, respecting, the, supernatural, and, monstrous, amongst, the, middle, and, higher, classes, there, was, little, taste, for, literature, and, still, less, for, science, hunting, shooting, wrestling, cockfighting, generally, ending, in, drunkenness, were, what, they, most, delighted, in, at, the, age, of, six, davy, was, sent, to, the, grammar, school, at, penzance, three, years, later, his, family, moved, to, varfell, near, ludgvan, and, subsequently, in, term, time, davy, boarded, with, john, tonkin, his, godfather, and, later, his, guardian, upon, davy, s, leaving, grammar, school, in, 1793, tonkin, paid, for, him, to, attend, truro, grammar, school, to, finish, his, education, under, the, rev, dr, cardew, who, in, a, letter, to, the, engineer, and, fellow, of, the, royal, society, davies, giddy, from, 1817, called, davies, gilbert, said, dryly, i, could, not, discern, the, faculties, by, which, he, was, afterwards, so, much, distinguished, davy, entertained, his, school, friends, by, writing, poetry, composing, valentines, and, telling, stories, from, one, thousand, and, one, nights, reflecting, on, his, school, days, in, a, letter, to, his, mother, davy, wrote, learning, naturally, is, a, true, pleasure, how, unfortunate, then, it, is, that, in, most, schools, it, is, made, a, pain, i, consider, it, fortunate, he, continued, i, was, left, much, to, myself, as, a, child, and, put, upon, no, particular, plan, of, study, what, i, am, i, made, myself, his, brother, said, davy, possessed, a, native, vigour, and, the, genuine, quality, of, genius, or, of, that, power, of, intellect, which, exalts, its, possessor, above, the, crowd, after, davy, s, father, died, in, 1794, tonkin, apprenticed, him, to, john, bingham, borlase, a, surgeon, with, a, practice, in, penzance, while, becoming, a, chemist, in, the, apothecary, s, dispensary, he, began, conducting, his, earliest, experiments, at, home, much, to, the, annoyance, of, his, friends, and, family, his, older, sister, for, instance, complained, his, corrosive, substances, were, destroying, her, dresses, and, at, least, one, friend, thought, it, likely, the, incorrigible, davy, would, eventually, blow, us, all, into, the, air, in, 1797, after, he, learnt, french, from, a, refugee, priest, davy, read, lavoisier, s, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, this, exposure, influenced, much, of, his, future, work, which, can, be, seen, as, reaction, against, lavoisier, s, work, and, the, dominance, of, french, chemists, as, a, poet, over, one, hundred, and, sixty, manuscript, poems, were, written, by, davy, the, majority, of, which, are, found, in, his, personal, notebooks, most, of, his, written, poems, were, not, published, and, he, chose, instead, to, share, a, few, of, them, with, his, friends, eight, of, his, known, poems, were, published, his, poems, reflected, his, views, on, both, his, career, and, also, his, perception, of, certain, aspects, of, human, life, he, wrote, on, human, endeavours, and, aspects, of, life, like, death, metaphysics, geology, natural, theology, and, chemistry, john, ayrton, paris, remarked, that, poems, written, by, the, young, davy, bear, the, stamp, of, lofty, genius, davy, s, first, preserved, poem, entitled, the, sons, of, genius, is, dated, 1795, and, marked, by, the, usual, immaturity, of, youth, other, poems, written, in, the, following, years, especially, on, the, mount, s, bay, and, st, michael, s, mount, are, descriptive, verses, although, he, initially, started, writing, his, poems, albeit, haphazardly, as, a, reflection, of, his, views, on, his, career, and, on, life, generally, most, of, his, final, poems, concentrated, on, immortality, and, death, this, was, after, he, started, experiencing, failing, health, and, a, decline, both, in, health, and, career, three, of, davy, s, paintings, from, around, 1796, have, been, donated, to, the, penlee, house, museum, at, penzance, one, is, of, the, view, from, above, gulval, showing, the, church, mount, s, bay, and, the, mount, while, the, other, two, depict, loch, lomond, in, scotland, at, 17, he, discussed, the, question, of, the, materiality, of, heat, with, his, quaker, friend, and, mentor, robert, dunkin, dunkin, remarked, i, tell, thee, what, humphry, thou, art, the, most, quibbling, hand, at, a, dispute, i, ever, met, with, in, my, life, one, winter, day, he, took, davy, to, the, lariggan, river, to, show, him, that, rubbing, two, plates, of, ice, together, developed, sufficient, energy, by, motion, to, melt, them, and, that, after, the, motion, was, suspended, the, pieces, were, united, by, regelation, it, was, a, crude, form, of, analogous, experiment, exhibited, by, davy, in, the, lecture, room, of, the, royal, institution, that, elicited, considerable, attention, as, professor, at, the, royal, institution, davy, repeated, many, of, the, ingenious, experiments, he, learnt, from, dunkin, davies, giddy, met, davy, in, penzance, carelessly, swinging, on, the, half, gate, of, dr, borlase, s, house, and, interested, by, his, talk, invited, him, to, his, house, at, tredrea, and, offered, him, the, use, of, his, library, this, led, to, his, introduction, to, dr, edwards, who, lived, at, hayle, copper, house, edwards, was, a, lecturer, in, chemistry, in, the, school, of, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, he, permitted, davy, to, use, his, laboratory, and, possibly, directed, his, attention, to, the, floodgates, of, the, port, of, hayle, which, were, rapidly, decaying, as, a, result, of, the, contact, between, copper, and, iron, under, the, influence, of, seawater, galvanic, corrosion, was, not, understood, at, that, time, but, the, phenomenon, prepared, davy, s, mind, for, subsequent, experiments, on, ships, copper, sheathing, gregory, watt, son, of, james, watt, visited, penzance, for, his, health, s, sake, and, while, lodging, at, the, davys, house, became, a, friend, and, gave, him, instructions, in, chemistry, davy, was, acquainted, with, the, wedgwood, family, who, spent, a, winter, at, penzance, at, this, time, physician, and, scientific, writer, thomas, beddoes, and, geologist, john, hailstone, were, engaged, in, a, geological, controversy, on, the, rival, merits, of, the, plutonian, and, neptunist, hypotheses, they, travelled, together, to, examine, the, cornish, coast, accompanied, by, giddy, an, intimate, friend, of, beddoes, and, made, davy, s, acquaintance, beddoes, who, had, established, at, bristol, the, medical, research, facility, the, pneumatic, institution, needed, an, assistant, to, superintend, the, laboratory, giddy, recommended, davy, and, in, 1798, gregory, watt, showed, beddoes, davy, s, young, man, s, researches, on, heat, and, light, which, were, subsequently, published, by, him, in, the, first, volume, of, west, country, contributions, after, prolonged, negotiations, mainly, by, giddy, mrs, davy, and, borlase, consented, to, davy, s, departure, but, tonkin, wished, him, to, remain, in, his, native, town, as, a, surgeon, and, altered, his, will, when, he, found, that, davy, insisted, on, going, to, dr, beddoes, on, 2, october, 1798, davy, joined, the, pneumatic, institution, at, bristol, it, had, been, established, to, investigate, the, medical, powers, of, factitious, airs, and, gases, gases, produced, experimentally, or, artificially, and, davy, was, to, superintend, the, various, experiments, the, arrangement, agreed, between, dr, beddoes, and, davy, was, generous, and, enabled, davy, to, give, up, all, claims, on, his, paternal, property, in, favour, of, his, mother, he, did, not, intend, to, abandon, the, medical, profession, and, was, determined, to, study, and, graduate, at, edinburgh, but, he, soon, began, to, fill, parts, of, the, institution, with, voltaic, batteries, while, living, in, bristol, davy, met, the, earl, of, durham, who, was, a, resident, in, the, institution, for, his, health, davy, threw, himself, energetically, into, the, work, of, the, laboratory, and, formed, a, long, romantic, friendship, with, mrs, anna, beddoes, the, novelist, maria, edgeworth, s, sister, who, acted, as, his, guide, on, walks, and, other, fine, sights, of, the, locality, the, critic, maurice, hindle, was, the, first, to, reveal, that, davy, and, anna, had, written, poems, for, each, other, wahida, amin, has, transcribed, and, discussed, a, number, of, poems, written, between, 1803, and, 1808, to, anna, and, one, to, her, infant, child, in, 1799, the, first, volume, of, the, west, country, collections, was, issued, half, consisted, of, davy, s, essays, on, heat, light, and, the, combinations, of, light, on, phos, oxygen, and, its, combinations, and, on, the, theory, of, respiration, on, 22, february, 1799, davy, wrote, to, davies, giddy, i, am, now, as, much, convinced, of, the, non, existence, of, caloric, as, i, am, of, the, existence, of, light, in, 1799, davy, became, increasingly, well, known, due, to, his, experiments, with, the, physiological, action, of, some, gases, including, laughing, gas, nitrous, oxide, the, gas, was, first, synthesised, in, 1772, by, the, natural, philosopher, and, chemist, joseph, priestley, who, called, it, dephlogisticated, nitrous, air, see, phlogiston, priestley, described, his, discovery, in, the, book, experiments, and, observations, on, different, kinds, of, air, 1775, in, which, he, described, how, to, produce, the, preparation, of, nitrous, air, diminished, by, heating, iron, filings, dampened, with, nitric, acid, in, another, letter, to, giddy, on, 10, april, davy, informs, him, i, made, a, discovery, yesterday, which, proves, how, necessary, it, is, to, repeat, experiments, the, gaseous, oxide, of, azote, the, laughing, gas, is, perfectly, respirable, when, pure, it, is, never, deleterious, but, when, it, contains, nitrous, gas, i, have, found, a, mode, of, making, it, pure, he, said, that, he, breathed, sixteen, quarts, of, it, for, nearly, seven, minutes, and, that, it, absolutely, intoxicated, me, in, addition, to, davy, himself, his, enthusiastic, experimental, subjects, included, his, poet, friends, robert, southey, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, as, well, as, gregory, watt, and, james, watt, other, close, friends, james, watt, built, a, portable, gas, chamber, to, facilitate, davy, s, experiments, with, the, inhalation, of, nitrous, oxide, at, one, point, the, gas, was, combined, with, wine, to, judge, its, efficacy, as, a, cure, for, hangover, his, laboratory, notebook, indicated, success, the, gas, was, popular, among, davy, s, friends, and, acquaintances, and, he, noted, that, it, might, be, useful, for, performing, surgical, operations, anesthetics, were, not, regularly, used, in, medicine, or, dentistry, until, decades, after, davy, s, death, in, the, gas, experiments, davy, ran, considerable, risks, his, respiration, of, nitric, oxide, which, may, have, combined, with, air, in, the, mouth, to, form, nitric, acid, hno, 3, severely, injured, the, mucous, membrane, and, in, davy, s, attempt, to, inhale, four, quarts, of, pure, hydrocarbonate, gas, in, an, experiment, with, carbon, monoxide, he, seemed, sinking, into, annihilation, on, being, removed, into, the, open, air, davy, faintly, articulated, i, do, not, think, i, shall, die, but, some, hours, elapsed, before, the, painful, symptoms, ceased, davy, was, able, to, take, his, own, pulse, as, he, staggered, out, of, the, laboratory, and, into, the, garden, and, he, described, it, in, his, notes, as, threadlike, and, beating, with, excessive, quickness, during, 1799, beddoes, and, davy, published, contributions, to, physical, and, medical, knowledge, principally, from, the, west, of, england, and, essays, on, heat, light, and, the, combinations, of, light, with, a, new, theory, of, respiration, on, the, generation, of, oxygen, gas, and, the, causes, of, the, colors, of, organic, beings, their, experimental, work, was, poor, and, the, publications, were, harshly, criticised, in, after, years, davy, regretted, he, had, ever, published, these, immature, hypotheses, which, he, subsequently, designated, the, dreams, of, misemployed, genius, which, the, light, of, experiment, and, observation, has, never, conducted, to, truth, these, criticisms, however, led, davy, to, refine, and, improve, his, experimental, techniques, spending, his, later, time, at, the, institution, increasingly, in, experimentation, in, december, 1799, davy, visited, london, for, the, first, time, and, extended, his, circle, of, friends, davy, features, in, the, diary, of, william, godwin, with, their, first, meeting, recorded, for, 4, december, 1799, in, 1800, davy, informed, giddy, that, he, had, been, repeating, the, galvanic, experiments, with, success, in, the, intervals, of, the, experiments, on, the, gases, which, almost, incessantly, occupied, him, from, january, to, april, in, 1800, davy, published, his, researches, chemical, and, philosophical, chiefly, concerning, nitrous, oxide, and, its, respiration, and, received, a, more, positive, response, william, wordsworth, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, moved, to, the, lake, district, in, 1800, and, asked, davy, to, deal, with, the, bristol, publishers, of, the, lyrical, ballads, biggs, cottle, coleridge, asked, davy, to, proofread, the, second, edition, the, first, to, contain, wordsworth, s, preface, to, the, lyrical, ballads, in, a, letter, dated, 16, july, 1800, will, you, be, so, kind, as, just, to, look, over, the, sheets, of, the, lyrical, ballads, wordsworth, subsequently, wrote, to, davy, on, 29, july, 1800, sending, him, the, first, manuscript, sheet, of, poems, and, asking, him, specifically, to, correct, any, thing, you, find, amiss, in, the, punctuation, a, business, at, which, i, am, ashamed, to, say, i, am, no, adept, wordsworth, was, ill, in, the, autumn, of, 1800, and, slow, in, sending, poems, for, the, second, edition, the, volume, appeared, on, 26, january, 1801, even, though, it, was, dated, 1800, while, it, is, impossible, to, know, whether, davy, was, at, fault, this, edition, of, the, lyrical, ballads, contained, many, errors, including, the, poem, michael, being, left, incomplete, in, a, personal, notebook, marked, on, the, front, cover, clifton, 1800, from, august, to, novr, davy, wrote, his, own, lyrical, ballad, as, i, was, walking, up, the, street, wordsworth, features, in, davy, s, poem, as, the, recorder, of, ordinary, lives, in, the, line, by, poet, wordsworths, rymes, in, 1799, benjamin, thompson, count, rumford, had, proposed, the, establishment, in, london, of, an, institution, for, diffusing, knowledge, i, e, the, royal, institution, the, house, in, albemarle, street, was, bought, in, april, 1799, rumford, became, secretary, to, the, institution, and, dr, thomas, garnett, was, the, first, lecturer, in, february, 1801, davy, was, interviewed, by, the, committee, of, the, royal, institution, comprising, joseph, banks, benjamin, thompson, and, henry, cavendish, davy, wrote, to, davies, giddy, on, 8, march, 1801, about, the, offers, made, by, banks, and, thompson, a, possible, move, to, london, and, the, promise, of, funding, for, his, work, in, galvanism, he, also, mentioned, that, he, might, not, be, collaborating, further, with, beddoes, on, therapeutic, gases, the, next, day, davy, left, bristol, to, take, up, his, new, post, at, the, royal, institution, it, having, been, resolved, that, humphry, davy, be, engaged, in, the, service, of, the, royal, institution, in, the, capacity, of, assistant, lecturer, in, chemistry, director, of, the, chemical, laboratory, and, assistant, editor, of, the, journals, of, the, institution, and, that, he, be, allowed, to, occupy, a, room, in, the, house, and, be, furnished, with, coals, and, candles, and, that, he, be, paid, a, salary, of, 100l, per, annum, on, 25, april, 1801, davy, gave, his, first, lecture, on, the, relatively, new, subject, of, galvanism, he, and, his, friend, coleridge, had, had, many, conversations, about, the, nature, of, human, knowledge, and, progress, and, davy, s, lectures, gave, his, audience, a, vision, of, human, civilisation, brought, forward, by, scientific, discovery, it, has, bestowed, on, him, powers, which, may, almost, be, called, creative, which, have, enabled, him, to, modify, and, change, the, beings, surrounding, him, and, by, his, experiments, to, interrogate, nature, with, power, not, simply, as, a, scholar, passive, and, seeking, only, to, understand, her, operations, but, rather, as, a, master, active, with, his, own, instruments, the, first, lecture, garnered, rave, reviews, and, by, the, june, lecture, davy, wrote, to, john, king, that, his, last, lecture, had, attendance, of, nearly, 500, people, there, was, respiration, nitrous, oxide, and, unbounded, applause, amen, davy, revelled, in, his, public, status, davy, s, lectures, included, spectacular, and, sometimes, dangerous, chemical, demonstrations, along, with, scientific, information, and, were, presented, with, considerable, showmanship, by, the, young, and, handsome, man, davy, also, included, both, poetic, and, religious, commentary, in, his, lectures, emphasizing, that, god, s, design, was, revealed, by, chemical, investigations, religious, commentary, was, in, part, an, attempt, to, appeal, to, women, in, his, audiences, davy, like, many, of, his, enlightenment, contemporaries, supported, female, education, and, women, s, involvement, in, scientific, pursuits, even, proposing, that, women, be, admitted, to, evening, events, at, the, royal, society, davy, acquired, a, large, female, following, around, london, in, a, satirical, cartoon, by, gillray, nearly, half, of, the, attendees, pictured, are, female, his, support, of, women, caused, davy, to, be, subjected, to, considerable, gossip, and, innuendo, and, to, be, criticised, as, unmanly, in, 1802, humphry, davy, had, what, was, then, the, most, powerful, electrical, battery, in, the, world, at, the, royal, institution, with, it, davy, created, the, first, incandescent, light, by, passing, electric, current, through, a, thin, strip, of, platinum, chosen, because, the, metal, had, an, extremely, high, melting, point, it, was, neither, sufficiently, bright, nor, long, lasting, enough, to, be, of, practical, use, but, demonstrated, the, principle, by, 1806, he, was, able, to, demonstrate, a, much, more, powerful, form, of, electric, lighting, to, the, royal, society, in, london, it, was, an, early, form, of, arc, light, which, produced, its, illumination, from, an, electric, arc, created, between, two, charcoal, rods, when, davy, s, lecture, series, on, galvanism, ended, he, progressed, to, a, new, series, on, agricultural, chemistry, and, his, popularity, continued, to, skyrocket, by, june, 1802, after, just, over, a, year, at, the, institution, and, at, the, age, of, 23, davy, was, nominated, to, full, lecturer, at, the, royal, institution, of, great, britain, garnett, quietly, resigned, citing, health, reasons, in, november, 1804, davy, became, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, over, which, he, would, later, preside, he, was, one, of, the, founding, members, of, the, geological, society, in, 1807, and, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1810, and, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1822, in, june, 1802, davy, published, in, the, first, issue, of, the, journals, of, the, royal, institution, of, great, britain, his, an, account, of, a, method, of, copying, paintings, upon, glass, and, of, making, profiles, by, the, agency, of, light, upon, nitrate, of, silver, invented, by, t, wedgwood, esq, with, observations, by, h, davy, in, which, he, described, their, experiments, with, the, photosensitivity, of, silver, nitrate, he, recorded, that, images, of, small, objects, produced, by, means, of, the, solar, microscope, may, be, copied, without, difficulty, on, prepared, paper, josef, maria, eder, in, his, history, of, photography, though, crediting, wedgwood, because, of, his, application, of, this, quality, of, silver, nitrate, to, the, making, of, images, as, the, first, photographer, in, the, world, proposes, that, it, was, davy, who, realised, the, idea, of, photographic, enlargement, using, a, solar, microscope, to, project, images, onto, sensitised, paper, neither, found, a, means, of, fixing, their, images, and, davy, devoted, no, more, of, his, time, to, furthering, these, early, discoveries, in, photography, the, principle, of, image, projection, using, solar, illumination, was, applied, to, the, construction, of, the, earliest, form, of, photographic, enlarger, the, solar, camera, davy, was, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, electrolysis, using, the, voltaic, pile, to, split, common, compounds, and, thus, prepare, many, new, elements, he, went, on, to, electrolyse, molten, salts, and, discovered, several, new, metals, including, sodium, and, potassium, highly, reactive, elements, known, as, the, alkali, metals, davy, discovered, potassium, in, 1807, deriving, it, from, caustic, potash, koh, before, the, 19th, century, no, distinction, had, been, made, between, potassium, and, sodium, potassium, was, the, first, metal, that, was, isolated, by, electrolysis, davy, isolated, sodium, in, the, same, year, by, passing, an, electric, current, through, molten, sodium, hydroxide, during, the, first, half, of, 1808, davy, conducted, a, series, of, further, electrolysis, experiments, on, alkaline, earths, including, lime, magnesia, strontites, and, barytes, at, the, beginning, of, june, davy, received, a, letter, from, the, swedish, chemist, berzelius, claiming, that, he, in, conjunction, with, dr, pontin, had, successfully, obtained, amalgams, of, calcium, and, barium, by, electrolysing, lime, and, barytes, using, a, mercury, cathode, davy, managed, to, successfully, repeat, these, experiments, almost, immediately, and, expanded, berzelius, method, to, strontites, and, magnesia, he, noted, that, while, these, amalgams, oxidised, in, only, a, few, minutes, when, exposed, to, air, they, could, be, preserved, for, lengthy, periods, of, time, when, submerged, in, naphtha, before, becoming, covered, with, a, white, crust, on, 30, june, 1808, davy, reported, to, the, royal, society, that, he, had, successfully, isolated, four, new, metals, which, he, named, barium, calcium, strontium, and, magnium, later, changed, to, magnesium, which, were, subsequently, published, in, the, philosophical, transactions, although, davy, conceded, magnium, was, an, undoubtedly, objectionable, name, he, argued, the, more, appropriate, name, magnesium, was, already, being, applied, to, metallic, manganese, and, wished, to, avoid, creating, an, equivocal, term, the, observations, gathered, from, these, experiments, also, led, to, davy, isolating, boron, in, 1809, berzelius, called, davy, s, 1806, bakerian, lecture, on, some, chemical, agencies, of, electricity, one, of, the, best, memoirs, which, has, ever, enriched, the, theory, of, chemistry, chlorine, was, discovered, in, 1774, by, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, who, called, it, dephlogisticated, marine, acid, see, phlogiston, theory, and, mistakenly, thought, it, contained, oxygen, davy, showed, that, the, acid, of, scheele, s, substance, called, at, the, time, oxymuriatic, acid, contained, no, oxygen, this, discovery, overturned, lavoisier, s, definition, of, acids, as, compounds, of, oxygen, in, 1810, chlorine, was, given, its, current, name, by, humphry, davy, who, insisted, that, chlorine, was, in, fact, an, element, the, name, chlorine, chosen, by, davy, for, one, of, obvious, and, characteristic, properties, its, colour, comes, from, the, greek, chl, ros, meaning, green, yellow, davy, seriously, injured, himself, in, a, laboratory, accident, with, nitrogen, trichloride, french, chemist, pierre, louis, dulong, had, first, prepared, this, compound, in, 1811, and, had, lost, two, fingers, and, an, eye, in, two, separate, explosions, with, it, in, a, letter, to, john, children, on, 16, november, 1812, davy, wrote, it, must, be, used, with, great, caution, it, is, not, safe, to, experiment, upon, a, globule, larger, than, a, pin, s, head, i, have, been, severely, wounded, by, a, piece, scarcely, bigger, my, sight, however, i, am, informed, will, not, be, injured, davy, s, accident, induced, him, to, hire, michael, faraday, as, a, co, worker, particularly, for, assistance, with, handwriting, and, record, keeping, he, had, recovered, from, his, injuries, by, april, 1813, in, 1812, davy, was, knighted, and, gave, up, his, lecturing, position, at, the, royal, institution, he, was, given, the, title, of, honorary, professor, of, chemistry, he, gave, a, farewell, lecture, to, the, institution, and, married, a, wealthy, widow, jane, apreece, while, davy, was, generally, acknowledged, as, being, faithful, to, his, wife, their, relationship, was, stormy, and, in, later, years, he, travelled, to, continental, europe, alone, davy, then, published, his, elements, of, chemical, philosophy, part, 1, volume, 1, though, other, parts, of, this, title, were, never, completed, he, made, notes, for, a, second, edition, but, it, was, never, required, in, october, 1813, he, and, his, wife, accompanied, by, michael, faraday, as, his, scientific, assistant, also, treated, as, a, valet, travelled, to, france, to, collect, the, second, edition, of, the, prix, du, galvanisme, a, medal, that, napoleon, bonaparte, had, awarded, davy, for, his, electro, chemical, work, faraday, noted, tis, indeed, a, strange, venture, at, this, time, to, trust, ourselves, in, a, foreign, and, hostile, country, where, so, little, regard, is, had, to, protestations, of, honour, that, the, slightest, suspicion, would, be, sufficient, to, separate, us, for, ever, from, england, and, perhaps, from, life, davy, s, party, sailed, from, plymouth, to, morlaix, by, cartel, where, they, were, searched, upon, reaching, paris, davy, was, a, guest, of, honour, at, a, meeting, of, the, first, class, of, the, institut, de, france, and, met, with, andr, marie, amp, re, and, other, french, chemists, it, was, later, reported, that, davy, s, wife, had, thrown, the, medal, onto, the, sea, near, her, cornish, home, as, it, raised, bad, memories, the, royal, society, of, chemistry, has, offered, over, 1, 800, for, the, recovery, of, the, medal, while, in, paris, davy, attended, lectures, at, the, ecole, polytechnique, including, those, by, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, on, a, mysterious, substance, isolated, by, bernard, courtois, davy, wrote, a, paper, for, the, royal, society, on, the, element, which, is, now, called, iodine, this, led, to, a, dispute, between, davy, and, gay, lussac, on, who, had, the, priority, on, the, research, davy, s, party, did, not, meet, napoleon, in, person, but, they, did, visit, the, empress, jos, phine, de, beauharnais, at, the, ch, teau, de, malmaison, the, party, left, paris, in, december, 1813, travelling, south, to, italy, they, sojourned, in, florence, where, using, the, burning, glass, of, the, grand, duke, of, tuscany, in, a, series, of, experiments, conducted, with, faraday, s, assistance, davy, succeeded, in, using, the, sun, s, rays, to, ignite, diamond, proving, it, is, composed, of, pure, carbon, davy, s, party, continued, to, rome, where, he, undertook, experiments, on, iodine, and, chlorine, and, on, the, colours, used, in, ancient, paintings, this, was, the, first, chemical, research, on, the, pigments, used, by, artists, he, also, visited, naples, and, mount, vesuvius, where, he, collected, samples, of, crystals, by, june, 1814, they, were, in, milan, where, they, met, alessandro, volta, and, then, continued, north, to, geneva, they, returned, to, italy, via, munich, and, innsbruck, and, when, their, plans, to, travel, to, greece, and, istanbul, were, abandoned, after, napoleon, s, escape, from, elba, they, returned, to, england, after, the, battle, of, waterloo, davy, wrote, to, lord, liverpool, urging, that, the, french, be, treated, with, severity, my, lord, i, need, not, say, to, your, lordship, that, the, capitulation, of, paris, not, a, treaty, lest, everything, belonging, to, the, future, state, of, that, capital, of, france, is, open, to, discussion, that, france, is, a, conquered, country, it, is, the, duty, of, the, allies, to, give, her, more, restricted, boundaries, which, shall, not, encroach, upon, the, natural, limits, of, other, nations, to, weaken, her, on, the, side, of, italy, germany, flanders, to, take, back, from, her, by, contributions, the, wealth, she, has, acquired, by, them, to, suffer, her, to, retain, nothing, that, the, republican, or, imperial, armies, have, stolen, this, last, duty, is, demanded, no, less, by, policy, than, justice, after, his, return, to, england, in, 1815, davy, began, experimenting, with, lamps, that, could, be, used, safely, in, coal, mines, the, revd, dr, robert, gray, of, bishopwearmouth, in, sunderland, founder, of, the, society, for, preventing, accidents, in, coalmines, had, written, to, davy, suggesting, that, he, might, use, his, extensive, stores, of, chemical, knowledge, to, address, the, issue, of, mining, explosions, caused, by, firedamp, or, methane, mixed, with, oxygen, which, was, often, ignited, by, the, open, flames, of, the, lamps, then, used, by, miners, incidents, such, as, the, felling, mine, disaster, of, 1812, near, newcastle, in, which, 92, men, were, killed, not, only, caused, great, loss, of, life, among, miners, but, also, meant, that, their, widows, and, children, had, to, be, supported, by, the, public, purse, the, revd, gray, and, a, fellow, clergyman, also, working, in, a, north, east, mining, area, the, revd, john, hodgson, of, jarrow, were, keen, that, action, should, be, taken, to, improve, underground, lighting, and, especially, the, lamps, used, by, miners, davy, conceived, of, using, an, iron, gauze, to, enclose, a, lamp, s, flame, and, so, prevent, the, methane, burning, inside, the, lamp, from, passing, out, to, the, general, atmosphere, although, the, idea, of, the, safety, lamp, had, already, been, demonstrated, by, william, reid, clanny, and, by, the, then, unknown, but, later, very, famous, engineer, george, stephenson, davy, s, use, of, wire, gauze, to, prevent, the, spread, of, flame, was, used, by, many, other, inventors, in, their, later, designs, george, stephenson, s, lamp, was, very, popular, in, the, north, east, coalfields, and, used, the, same, principle, of, preventing, the, flame, reaching, the, general, atmosphere, but, by, different, means, unfortunately, although, the, new, design, of, gauze, lamp, initially, did, seem, to, offer, protection, it, gave, much, less, light, and, quickly, deteriorated, in, the, wet, conditions, of, most, pits, rusting, of, the, gauze, quickly, made, the, lamp, unsafe, and, the, number, of, deaths, from, firedamp, explosions, rose, yet, further, there, was, some, discussion, as, to, whether, davy, had, discovered, the, principles, behind, his, lamp, without, the, help, of, the, work, of, smithson, tennant, but, it, was, generally, agreed, that, the, work, of, the, two, men, had, been, independent, davy, refused, to, patent, the, lamp, and, its, invention, led, to, his, being, awarded, the, rumford, medal, in, 1816, in, 1815, davy, also, suggested, that, acids, were, substances, that, contained, replaceable, hydrogen, ions, hydrogen, that, could, be, partly, or, totally, replaced, by, reactive, metals, which, are, placed, above, hydrogen, in, the, reactivity, series, when, acids, reacted, with, metals, they, formed, salts, and, hydrogen, gas, bases, were, substances, that, reacted, with, acids, to, form, salts, and, water, these, definitions, worked, well, for, most, of, the, nineteenth, century, davy, experimented, on, fragments, of, the, herculaneum, papyri, before, his, departure, to, naples, in, 1818, his, early, experiments, showed, hope, of, success, in, his, report, to, the, royal, society, davy, writes, that, when, a, fragment, of, a, brown, ms, in, which, the, layers, were, strongly, adhered, was, placed, in, an, atmosphere, of, chlorine, there, was, an, immediate, action, the, papyrus, smoked, and, became, yellow, and, the, letters, appeared, much, more, distinct, and, by, the, application, of, heat, the, layers, separated, from, each, other, giving, fumes, of, muriatic, acid, the, success, of, the, early, trials, prompted, davy, to, travel, to, naples, to, conduct, further, research, on, the, herculaneum, papyri, accompanied, by, his, wife, they, set, off, on, 26, may, 1818, to, stay, in, flanders, where, davy, was, invited, by, the, coal, miners, to, speak, they, then, traveled, to, carniola, now, slovenia, which, proved, to, become, his, favourite, alpine, retreat, before, finally, arriving, in, italy, in, italy, they, befriended, lord, byron, in, rome, and, then, went, on, to, travel, to, naples, initial, experiments, were, again, promising, and, his, work, resulted, in, partially, unrolling, 23, mss, from, which, fragments, of, writing, were, obtained, but, after, returning, to, naples, on, 1, december, 1819, from, a, summer, in, the, alps, davy, complained, that, the, italians, at, the, museum, no, longer, helpful, but, obstructive, davy, decided, to, renounce, further, work, on, the, papyri, because, the, labour, in, itself, difficult, and, unpleasant, been, made, more, so, by, the, conduct, of, the, persons, at, the, head, of, this, department, in, the, museum, on, 20, october, 1818, davy, was, created, a, baronet, this, was, the, first, such, honour, conferred, on, a, man, of, science, in, britain, it, was, followed, a, year, later, with, the, presidency, of, the, royal, society, the, society, was, in, transition, from, a, club, for, gentlemen, interested, in, natural, philosophy, connected, with, the, political, and, social, elite, to, an, academy, representing, increasingly, specialised, sciences, the, previous, president, joseph, banks, had, held, the, post, for, over, 40, years, and, had, presided, autocratically, over, what, david, philip, miller, calls, the, banksian, learned, empire, in, which, natural, history, was, prominent, banks, had, groomed, davies, gilbert, to, succeed, him, and, preserve, the, status, quo, but, gilbert, declined, to, stand, fellows, who, thought, royal, patronage, was, important, proposed, prince, leopold, of, saxe, coburg, later, leopold, i, of, belgium, who, also, withdrew, as, did, the, whig, edward, st, maur, 11th, duke, of, somerset, davy, was, the, outstanding, scientist, but, some, fellows, did, not, approve, of, his, popularising, work, at, the, royal, institution, elections, took, place, on, st, andrew, s, day, and, davy, was, elected, on, 30, november, 1820, although, he, was, unopposed, other, candidates, had, received, initial, backing, these, candidates, embodied, the, factional, difficulties, that, beset, davy, s, presidency, and, which, eventually, defeated, him, the, strongest, alternative, had, been, william, hyde, wollaston, who, was, supported, by, the, cambridge, network, of, outstanding, mathematicians, such, as, charles, babbage, and, john, herschel, who, tried, to, block, davy, they, were, aware, that, davy, supported, some, modernisation, but, thought, that, he, would, not, sufficiently, encourage, aspiring, young, mathematicians, astronomers, and, geologists, who, were, beginning, to, form, specialist, societies, davy, was, only, 41, and, reformers, were, fearful, of, another, long, presidency, in, his, early, years, davy, was, optimistic, about, reconciling, the, reformers, and, the, banksians, in, his, first, speech, as, president, he, declared, i, trust, that, with, these, new, societies, we, shall, always, preserve, the, most, amicable, relations, i, am, sure, there, is, no, desire, in, to, exert, anything, like, patriarchal, authority, in, relation, to, these, institutions, from, 1761, onwards, copper, plating, had, been, fitted, to, the, undersides, of, royal, navy, ships, to, protect, the, wood, from, attack, by, shipworms, however, the, copper, bottoms, were, gradually, corroded, by, exposure, to, the, salt, water, between, 1823, and, 1825, davy, assisted, by, michael, faraday, attempted, to, protect, the, copper, by, electrochemical, means, he, attached, to, the, copper, sacrificial, pieces, of, zinc, or, iron, which, provided, cathodic, protection, to, the, host, metal, it, was, discovered, however, that, protected, copper, became, foul, quickly, i, e, pieces, of, weed, and, or, marine, creatures, became, attached, to, the, hull, which, had, a, detrimental, effect, on, the, handling, of, the, ship, the, navy, board, approached, davy, in, 1823, asking, for, help, with, the, corrosion, davy, conducted, a, number, of, tests, in, portsmouth, dockyard, which, led, to, the, navy, board, adopting, the, use, of, davy, s, protectors, by, 1824, it, had, become, apparent, that, fouling, of, the, copper, bottoms, was, occurring, on, the, majority, of, protected, ships, by, the, end, of, 1825, the, admiralty, ordered, the, navy, board, to, cease, fitting, the, protectors, to, sea, going, ships, and, to, remove, those, that, had, already, been, fitted, davy, s, scheme, was, seen, as, a, public, failure, despite, success, of, the, corrosion, protection, as, such, as, frank, a, j, l, james, explains, the, poisonous, salts, from, copper, were, no, longer, entering, the, water, there, was, nothing, to, kill, the, barnacles, and, the, like, in, the, vicinity, of, a, ship, this, meant, that, barnacles, could, now, attach, themselves, to, the, bottom, of, a, vessel, thus, impeding, severely, its, steerage, much, to, the, anger, of, the, captains, who, wrote, to, the, admiralty, to, complain, about, davy, s, protectors, davy, spent, much, time, juggling, the, factions, but, as, his, reputation, declined, in, the, light, of, failures, such, as, his, research, into, copper, bottomed, ships, he, lost, popularity, and, authority, this, was, compounded, by, a, number, of, political, errors, in, 1825, his, promotion, of, the, new, zoological, society, of, which, he, was, a, founding, fellow, courted, the, landed, gentry, and, alienated, expert, zoologists, he, offended, the, mathematicians, and, reformers, by, failing, to, ensure, that, babbage, received, one, of, the, new, royal, medals, a, project, of, his, or, the, vacant, secretaryship, of, the, society, in, 1826, in, 1826, davy, suffered, a, stroke, from, which, he, never, fully, recovered, in, november, 1826, the, mathematician, edward, ryan, recorded, that, the, society, every, member, almost, are, in, the, greatest, rage, at, the, president, s, proceedings, and, nothing, is, now, talked, of, but, removing, him, in, the, event, he, was, again, re, elected, unopposed, but, he, was, now, visibly, unwell, in, january, 1827, he, set, off, to, italy, for, reasons, of, his, health, it, did, not, improve, and, as, the, 1827, election, loomed, it, was, clear, that, he, would, not, stand, again, he, was, succeeded, by, davies, gilbert, davy, s, laboratory, assistant, michael, faraday, went, on, to, enhance, davy, s, work, and, would, become, the, more, famous, and, influential, scientist, davy, is, supposed, to, have, even, claimed, faraday, as, his, greatest, discovery, davy, later, accused, faraday, of, plagiarism, however, causing, faraday, the, first, fullerian, professor, of, chemistry, to, cease, all, research, in, electromagnetism, until, his, mentor, s, death, the, preceding, paragraph, may, be, unduly, charitable, to, davy, the, accusation, by, davy, of, plagiarism, by, faraday, occurred, already, in, 1821, regarding, faraday, s, first, major, discovery, independent, of, davy, of, electromagnetic, rotation, the, first, electric, motor, according, to, geoffrey, cantor, s, 1991, biography, of, faraday, p, 266, 67, this, dubious, accusation, was, davy, s, final, bid, to, dominate, faraday, davy, resenting, the, success, of, his, earnest, and, hardworking, assistant, was, trying, to, keep, him, down, master, and, servant, were, in, direct, competition, and, their, rivalry, may, have, motivated, davy, s, attempt, to, block, faraday, s, membership, of, the, royal, society, although, davy, was, unsuccessful, in, preventing, faraday, s, membership, this, incident, proved, a, turning, point, in, their, relationship, other, sources, report, the, jibe, that, davy, s, greatest, discovery, was, faraday, as, a, cruel, joke, at, davy, s, expense, not, a, gracious, acknowledgment, by, davy, himself, of, faraday, s, greater, scientific, achievements, according, to, one, of, davy, s, biographers, june, z, fullmer, he, was, a, deist, of, a, sanguine, somewhat, irritable, temperament, davy, displayed, characteristic, enthusiasm, and, energy, in, all, his, pursuits, as, is, shown, by, his, verses, and, sometimes, by, his, prose, his, mind, was, highly, imaginative, the, poet, coleridge, declared, that, if, he, had, not, been, the, first, chemist, he, would, have, been, the, first, poet, of, his, age, and, southey, said, that, he, had, all, the, elements, of, a, poet, he, only, wanted, the, art, in, spite, of, his, ungainly, exterior, and, peculiar, manner, his, happy, gifts, of, exposition, and, illustration, won, him, extraordinary, popularity, as, a, lecturer, his, experiments, were, ingenious, and, rapidly, performed, and, coleridge, went, to, hear, him, to, increase, his, stock, of, metaphors, the, dominating, ambition, of, his, life, was, to, achieve, fame, occasional, petty, jealousy, did, not, diminish, his, concern, for, the, cause, of, humanity, to, use, a, phrase, often, employed, by, him, in, connection, with, his, invention, of, the, miners, lamp, careless, about, etiquette, his, frankness, sometimes, exposed, him, to, annoyances, he, might, have, avoided, by, the, exercise, of, tact, davy, spent, the, last, months, of, his, life, writing, consolations, in, travel, an, immensely, popular, somewhat, freeform, compendium, of, poetry, thoughts, on, science, and, philosophy, published, posthumously, the, work, became, a, staple, of, both, scientific, and, family, libraries, for, several, decades, afterward, davy, spent, the, winter, in, rome, hunting, in, the, campagna, on, his, fiftieth, birthday, but, on, 20, february, 1829, he, had, another, stroke, after, spending, many, months, attempting, to, recuperate, davy, died, in, a, room, at, l, hotel, de, la, couronne, in, the, rue, du, rhone, in, geneva, switzerland, on, 29, may, 1829, an, appendix, to, his, will, had, included, his, last, wishes, that, there, be, no, post, mortem, that, he, be, buried, where, he, died, and, that, there, be, an, interval, between, the, two, to, ensure, that, he, was, not, merely, comatose, but, the, ordinances, of, the, city, did, not, allow, such, an, interval, and, his, funeral, took, place, on, the, following, monday, 1, june, in, the, plainpalais, cemetery, outside, the, city, walls, see, fullmer, s, work, for, a, full, list, of, davy, s, articles, humphry, davy, s, books, are, as, follows, davy, also, contributed, articles, on, chemistry, to, rees, s, cyclop, dia, but, the, topics, are, not, known, his, collected, works, were, published, in, 1839, 1840
