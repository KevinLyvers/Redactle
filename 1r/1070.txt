the, greatest, military, expansions, in, roman, history, during, which, by, the, time, of, his, death, the, roman, empire, reached, its, maximum, territorial, extent, he, was, given, the, title, of, optimus, the, best, by, the, roman, senate, trajan, was, born, in, the, municipium, of, italica, in, the, present, day, andalusian, province, of, seville, in, southern, spain, an, italic, settlement,

distinguished, senator, trajan, rose, to, prominence, during, the, reign, of, domitian, in, ad, 89, serving, as, a, legatus, legionis, in, hispania, tarraconensis, he, supported, the, emperor, against, a, revolt, on, the, rhine, led, by, antonius, saturninus, he, then, served, as, governor, of, germania, and, pannonia, in, september, 96, domitian, was, succeeded, by, the, elderly, and, childless, nerva, who, proved, to, be, unpopular, with, the, army, after, a, revolt, by, members, of, the, praetorian, guard, nerva, decided, to, adopt, as, his, heir, and, successor, the, more, popular, trajan, who, had, distinguished, himself, in, military, campaigns, against, germanic, tribes, as, emperor, of, rome, trajan, oversaw, the, construction, of, building, projects, such, as, the, forum, named, after, him, the, introduction, of, social, welfare, policies, such, as, the, alimenta, and, new, military, conquests, he, annexed, nabataea, and, dacia, and, his, war, against, the, parthian, empire, ended, with, the, incorporation, of, armenia, mesopotamia, and, assyria, as, roman, provinces, in, august, ad, 117, while, sailing, back, to, rome, trajan, fell, ill, and, died, of, a, stroke, in, the, city, of, selinus, he, was, deified, by, the, senate, and, his, successor, hadrian, trajan, s, cousin, according, to, historical, tradition, trajan, s, ashes, were, entombed, in, a, small, room, beneath, trajan, s, column, as, an, emperor, trajan, s, reputation, has, endured, he, is, one, of, the, few, rulers, whose, reputation, has, survived, 19, centuries, every, new, emperor, after, him, was, honoured, by, the, senate, with, the, wish, felicior, augusto, melior, traiano, that, he, be, luckier, than, augustus, and, better, than, trajan, among, medieval, christian, theologians, trajan, was, considered, a, virtuous, pagan, in, the, renaissance, machiavelli, speaking, on, the, advantages, of, adoptive, succession, over, heredity, mentioned, the, five, successive, good, emperors, from, nerva, to, marcus, a, trope, out, of, which, the, 18th, century, historian, edward, gibbon, popularized, the, notion, of, the, five, good, emperors, of, whom, trajan, was, the, second, an, account, of, the, dacian, wars, the, commentarii, de, bellis, dacicis, written, by, trajan, himself, or, a, ghostwriter, and, modelled, after, caesar, s, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, is, lost, with, the, exception, of, one, sentence, only, fragments, remain, of, the, getica, a, book, by, trajan, s, personal, physician, titus, statilius, criton, the, parthica, a, 17, volume, account, of, the, parthian, wars, written, by, arrian, has, met, a, similar, fate, book, 68, in, greek, author, cassius, dio, s, roman, history, which, survives, mostly, as, byzantine, abridgements, and, epitomes, is, the, main, source, for, the, political, history, of, trajan, s, rule, besides, this, pliny, the, younger, s, panegyricus, and, dio, chrysostom, s, orations, are, the, best, surviving, contemporary, sources, both, are, adulatory, perorations, typical, of, the, high, imperial, period, that, describe, an, idealized, monarch, and, an, equally, idealized, view, of, trajan, s, rule, and, concern, themselves, more, with, ideology, than, with, fact, the, 10th, volume, of, pliny, s, letters, contains, his, correspondence, with, trajan, which, deals, with, various, aspects, of, imperial, roman, government, it, is, generally, agreed, that, pliny, being, part, of, the, emperor, s, inner, circle, provides, a, unique, and, valuable, source, of, information, through, his, letters, with, trajan, the, only, surviving, correspondence, between, a, governor, and, his, emperor, however, it, has, been, argued, that, pliny, s, correspondence, with, trajan, is, neither, intimate, nor, candid, but, rather, an, exchange, of, official, mail, in, which, pliny, s, stance, borders, on, the, servile, some, authors, have, even, proposed, that, much, of, the, text, was, written, and, or, edited, by, trajan, s, imperial, secretary, his, ab, epistulis, given, the, scarcity, of, literary, sources, discussion, of, trajan, and, his, rule, in, modern, historiography, cannot, avoid, speculation, non, literary, sources, such, as, archaeology, epigraphy, and, numismatics, are, also, useful, for, reconstructing, his, reign, marcus, ulpius, traianus, was, born, on, 18, september, ad, 53, in, the, roman, province, of, hispania, baetica, in, what, is, now, andalusia, in, modern, spain, in, the, municipium, of, italica, now, in, the, municipal, area, of, santiponce, in, the, outskirts, of, seville, a, roman, colony, established, in, 206, bc, by, scipio, africanus, at, the, time, of, trajan, s, birth, it, was, a, small, town, without, baths, theatre, and, amphitheatre, and, with, a, very, narrow, territory, under, its, direct, administration, trajan, s, year, of, birth, is, not, reliably, attested, and, may, instead, have, been, ad, 56, the, epitome, of, cassius, dio, s, roman, history, describes, trajan, as, an, iberian, and, neither, an, italian, nor, even, an, italiote, but, this, claim, is, contradicted, by, other, ancient, sources, and, rejected, by, modern, scholars, who, have, reconstructed, trajan, s, italic, lineage, appian, states, that, trajan, s, hometown, of, italica, was, settled, by, and, named, after, italic, veterans, who, fought, in, spain, under, scipio, and, new, settlers, arrived, there, from, italy, in, the, following, centuries, among, the, italic, settlers, were, the, ulpii, and, the, traii, who, were, either, part, of, the, original, colonists, or, arrived, as, late, as, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, bc, their, original, home, according, to, the, description, of, trajan, as, ulpius, traianus, ex, urbe, tudertina, in, the, epitome, de, caesaribus, was, the, town, of, tuder, todi, in, the, umbria, region, of, central, italy, this, is, confirmed, by, archeology, with, epigraphic, evidence, placing, both, the, ulpii, and, the, traii, in, umbria, generally, and, tuder, specifically, and, by, linguistic, studies, of, the, family, names, ulpius, and, traius, which, show, that, both, are, of, osco, umbrian, origin, it, is, unknown, whether, trajan, s, ancestors, were, roman, citizens, or, not, at, their, arrival, in, spain, they, would, have, certainly, possessed, roman, citizenship, in, case, they, arrived, after, the, social, war, 91, 87, bc, when, tuder, became, a, municipium, of, roman, citizens, in, spain, they, may, well, have, intermarried, with, native, iberians, in, which, case, they, would, have, lost, their, citizenship, had, they, lacked, or, lost, the, status, of, roman, citizens, they, would, have, achieved, it, or, recovered, it, when, italica, became, a, municipium, with, latin, rights, in, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, trajan, s, paternal, grandfather, ulpius, married, a, traia, their, son, trajan, s, namesake, father, marcus, ulpius, traianus, was, born, at, italica, during, the, reign, of, tiberius, and, became, a, prominent, senator, and, general, commanding, the, legio, x, fretensis, under, vespasian, in, the, first, jewish, roman, war, trajan, s, mother, was, marcia, a, roman, noblewoman, of, the, gens, marcia, and, a, sister, in, law, of, the, second, flavian, emperor, titus, little, is, known, of, her, her, father, is, believed, to, be, quintus, marcius, barea, sura, her, mother, was, antonia, furnilla, daughter, of, aulus, antonius, rufus, and, furnia, trajan, owned, some, lands, called, figlinae, marcianae, in, ameria, another, umbrian, town, located, near, both, tuder, and, reate, the, home, of, the, flavian, dynasty, and, believed, to, be, the, home, of, marcia, s, family, the, line, of, the, ulpii, continued, long, after, trajan, s, death, his, elder, sister, was, ulpia, marciana, and, his, niece, was, salonia, matidia, very, little, is, known, about, trajan, s, early, formative, years, but, it, is, thought, likely, that, he, spent, his, first, months, or, years, in, italica, before, moving, to, rome, and, then, perhaps, at, around, eight, or, nine, years, of, age, he, almost, certainly, would, have, returned, temporarily, to, italica, with, his, father, during, trajanus, governorship, of, baetica, ca, 64, 65, the, lack, of, a, strong, local, power, base, caused, by, the, size, of, the, town, from, which, they, came, made, it, necessary, for, the, ulpii, and, for, the, aelii, the, other, important, senatorial, family, of, italica, with, whom, they, were, allied, to, weave, local, alliances, in, the, baetica, with, the, annii, the, ucubi, and, perhaps, the, dasumii, from, corduba, the, tarraconense, and, the, narbonense, here, above, all, through, pompeia, plotina, trajan, s, wife, many, of, these, alliances, were, made, not, in, spain, but, in, rome, the, family, home, in, rome, the, domus, traiana, was, on, the, aventine, hill, excavations, under, the, piazza, del, tempio, di, diana, found, remains, thought, to, be, of, the, family, s, large, suburban, villa, with, evidence, of, highly, decorated, rooms, as, a, young, man, trajan, rose, through, the, ranks, of, the, roman, army, serving, in, some, of, the, most, contested, parts, of, the, empire, s, frontier, in, 76, 77, his, father, was, governor, of, syria, legatus, pro, praetore, syriae, where, trajan, himself, remained, as, tribunus, legionis, from, there, after, his, father, s, replacement, he, seems, to, have, been, transferred, to, an, unspecified, rhine, province, and, pliny, implies, that, he, engaged, in, active, combat, duty, during, both, commissions, in, about, 86, trajan, s, cousin, aelius, afer, died, leaving, his, young, children, hadrian, and, paulina, orphans, trajan, and, his, colleague, publius, acilius, attianus, became, co, guardians, of, the, two, children, trajan, in, his, late, thirties, was, created, ordinary, consul, for, the, year, 91, this, early, appointment, may, reflect, the, prominence, of, his, father, s, career, as, his, father, had, been, instrumental, to, the, ascent, of, the, ruling, flavian, dynasty, held, consular, rank, himself, and, had, just, been, made, a, patrician, around, this, time, trajan, brought, the, architect, and, engineer, apollodorus, of, damascus, with, him, to, rome, and, married, pompeia, plotina, a, noblewoman, from, the, roman, settlement, at, n, mes, the, marriage, ultimately, remained, childless, the, historian, cassius, dio, later, noted, that, trajan, was, a, lover, of, young, men, in, contrast, to, the, usual, bisexual, activity, that, was, common, among, upper, class, roman, men, of, the, period, the, emperor, julian, also, made, a, sardonic, reference, to, his, predecessor, s, sexual, preference, stating, that, zeus, himself, would, have, had, to, be, on, guard, had, his, ganymede, come, within, trajan, s, vicinity, this, distaste, reflected, a, change, of, mores, that, began, with, the, severan, dynasty, trajan, s, putative, lovers, included, the, future, emperor, hadrian, pages, of, the, imperial, household, the, actor, pylades, a, dancer, called, apolaustus, lucius, licinius, sura, and, trajan, s, predecessor, nerva, cassius, dio, also, relates, that, trajan, made, an, ally, out, of, abgar, vii, on, account, of, the, latter, s, beautiful, son, arbandes, who, would, then, dance, for, trajan, at, a, banquet, the, details, of, trajan, s, early, military, career, are, obscure, save, for, the, fact, that, in, 89, as, legate, of, legio, vii, gemina, in, hispania, tarraconensis, he, supported, domitian, against, an, attempted, coup, by, lucius, antonius, saturninus, the, governor, of, germania, superior, trajan, probably, remained, in, the, region, after, the, revolt, was, quashed, to, engage, with, the, chatti, who, had, sided, with, saturninus, before, returning, the, vii, gemina, legion, to, legio, in, hispania, tarraconensis, in, 91, he, held, a, consulate, with, acilius, glabrio, a, rarity, in, that, neither, consul, was, a, member, of, the, ruling, dynasty, he, held, an, unspecified, consular, commission, as, governor, of, either, pannonia, or, germania, superior, or, possibly, both, pliny, who, seems, to, deliberately, avoid, offering, details, that, would, stress, personal, attachment, between, trajan, and, the, tyrant, domitian, attributes, to, him, at, the, time, various, and, unspecified, feats, of, arms, domitian, s, successor, nerva, was, unpopular, with, the, army, and, had, been, forced, by, his, praetorian, prefect, casperius, aelianus, to, execute, domitian, s, killers, nerva, needed, the, army, s, support, to, avoid, being, ousted, he, accomplished, this, in, the, summer, of, 97, by, naming, trajan, as, his, adoptive, son, and, successor, claiming, that, this, was, entirely, due, to, trajan, s, outstanding, military, merits, there, are, hints, however, in, contemporary, literary, sources, that, trajan, s, adoption, was, imposed, on, nerva, pliny, implied, as, much, when, he, wrote, that, although, an, emperor, could, not, be, coerced, into, doing, something, if, this, was, the, way, in, which, trajan, was, raised, to, power, then, it, was, worth, it, alice, k, nig, argues, that, the, notion, of, a, natural, continuity, between, nerva, s, and, trajan, s, reigns, was, an, ex, post, facto, fiction, developed, by, authors, writing, under, trajan, including, tacitus, and, pliny, according, to, the, historia, augusta, the, future, emperor, hadrian, brought, word, to, trajan, of, his, adoption, trajan, retained, hadrian, on, the, rhine, frontier, as, a, military, tribune, and, hadrian, thus, became, privy, to, the, circle, of, friends, and, relations, with, whom, trajan, surrounded, himself, among, them, was, lucius, licinius, sura, a, roman, senator, born, in, spain, and, the, governor, of, germania, inferior, who, was, trajan, s, personal, friend, and, became, an, official, adviser, of, the, emperor, sura, was, highly, influential, and, was, appointed, consul, for, a, third, term, in, 107, some, senators, may, have, resented, sura, s, activities, as, a, kingmaker, and, minence, grise, among, them, the, historian, tacitus, who, acknowledged, sura, s, military, and, oratorical, talents, but, compared, his, rapacity, and, devious, ways, to, those, of, vespasian, s, minence, grise, licinius, mucianus, sura, is, said, to, have, informed, hadrian, in, 108, that, he, had, been, chosen, as, trajan, s, imperial, heir, as, governor, of, upper, germany, germania, superior, during, nerva, s, reign, trajan, received, the, impressive, title, of, germanicus, for, his, skilful, management, and, rule, of, the, volatile, imperial, province, when, nerva, died, on, 28, january, 98, trajan, succeeded, to, the, role, of, emperor, without, any, outward, adverse, incident, the, fact, that, he, chose, not, to, hasten, towards, rome, but, made, a, lengthy, tour, of, inspection, on, the, rhine, and, danube, frontiers, may, suggest, that, he, was, unsure, of, his, position, both, in, rome, and, with, the, armies, at, the, front, alternatively, trajan, s, keen, military, mind, understood, the, importance, of, strengthening, the, empire, s, frontiers, his, vision, for, future, conquests, required, the, diligent, improvement, of, surveillance, networks, defences, and, transport, along, the, danube, prior, to, his, frontier, tours, trajan, ordered, his, prefect, aelianus, to, attend, him, in, germany, where, he, was, apparently, executed, forthwith, put, out, of, the, way, and, his, now, vacant, post, taken, by, attius, suburanus, trajan, s, accession, therefore, could, qualify, more, as, a, successful, coup, than, an, orderly, succession, on, his, entry, to, rome, trajan, granted, the, plebs, a, direct, gift, of, money, the, traditional, donative, to, the, troops, however, was, reduced, by, half, there, remained, the, issue, of, the, strained, relations, between, the, emperor, and, the, senate, especially, after, the, supposed, bloodiness, that, had, marked, domitian, s, reign, and, his, dealings, with, the, curia, by, feigning, reluctance, to, hold, power, trajan, was, able, to, start, building, a, consensus, around, him, in, the, senate, his, belated, ceremonial, entry, into, rome, in, 99, was, notably, understated, something, on, which, pliny, the, younger, elaborated, by, not, openly, supporting, domitian, s, preference, for, equestrian, officers, trajan, appeared, to, conform, to, the, idea, developed, by, pliny, that, an, emperor, derived, his, legitimacy, from, his, adherence, to, traditional, hierarchies, and, senatorial, morals, therefore, he, could, point, to, the, allegedly, republican, character, of, his, rule, in, a, speech, at, the, inauguration, of, his, third, consulship, on, 1, january, 100, trajan, exhorted, the, senate, to, share, the, care, taking, of, the, empire, with, him, an, event, later, celebrated, on, a, coin, in, reality, trajan, did, not, share, power, in, any, meaningful, way, with, the, senate, something, that, pliny, admits, candidly, verything, depends, on, the, whims, of, a, single, man, who, on, behalf, of, the, common, welfare, has, taken, upon, himself, all, functions, and, all, tasks, one, of, the, most, significant, trends, of, his, reign, was, his, encroachment, on, the, senate, s, sphere, of, authority, such, as, his, decision, to, make, the, senatorial, provinces, of, achaea, and, bithynia, into, imperial, ones, in, order, to, deal, with, the, inordinate, spending, on, public, works, by, local, magnates, and, the, general, mismanagement, of, provincial, affairs, by, various, proconsuls, appointed, by, the, senate, in, the, formula, developed, by, pliny, however, trajan, was, a, good, emperor, in, that, by, himself, he, approved, or, blamed, the, same, things, that, the, senate, would, have, approved, or, blamed, if, in, reality, trajan, was, an, autocrat, his, deferential, behavior, towards, his, peers, qualified, him, to, be, viewed, as, a, virtuous, monarch, the, idea, is, that, trajan, wielded, autocratic, power, through, moderatio, instead, of, contumacia, moderation, instead, of, insolence, in, short, according, to, the, ethics, for, autocracy, developed, by, most, political, writers, of, the, imperial, roman, age, trajan, was, a, good, ruler, in, that, he, ruled, less, by, fear, and, more, by, acting, as, a, role, model, for, according, to, pliny, men, learn, better, from, examples, eventually, trajan, s, popularity, among, his, peers, was, such, that, the, roman, senate, bestowed, upon, him, the, honorific, of, optimus, meaning, the, best, which, appears, on, coins, from, 105, on, this, title, had, mostly, to, do, with, trajan, s, role, as, benefactor, such, as, in, the, case, of, his, returning, confiscated, property, pliny, states, that, trajan, s, ideal, role, was, a, conservative, one, argued, as, well, by, the, orations, of, dio, chrysostom, in, particular, his, four, orations, on, kingship, composed, early, during, trajan, s, reign, dio, as, a, greek, notable, and, intellectual, with, friends, in, high, places, and, possibly, an, official, friend, to, the, emperor, amicus, caesaris, saw, trajan, as, a, defender, of, the, status, quo, in, his, third, kingship, oration, dio, describes, an, ideal, king, ruling, by, means, of, friendship, that, is, through, patronage, and, a, network, of, local, notables, who, act, as, mediators, between, the, ruled, and, the, ruler, dio, s, notion, of, being, friend, to, trajan, or, any, other, roman, emperor, however, was, that, of, an, informal, arrangement, that, involved, no, formal, entry, of, such, friends, into, the, roman, administration, trajan, ingratiated, himself, with, the, greek, intellectual, elite, by, recalling, to, rome, many, including, dio, who, had, been, exiled, by, domitian, and, by, returning, in, a, process, begun, by, nerva, a, great, deal, of, private, property, that, domitian, had, confiscated, he, also, had, good, dealings, with, plutarch, who, as, a, notable, of, delphi, seems, to, have, been, favoured, by, the, decisions, taken, on, behalf, of, his, home, place, by, one, of, trajan, s, legates, who, had, arbitrated, a, boundary, dispute, between, delphi, and, its, neighbouring, cities, however, it, was, clear, to, trajan, that, greek, intellectuals, and, notables, were, to, be, regarded, as, tools, for, local, administration, and, not, be, allowed, to, fancy, themselves, in, a, privileged, position, as, pliny, said, in, one, of, his, letters, at, the, time, it, was, official, policy, that, greek, civic, elites, be, treated, according, to, their, status, as, notionally, free, but, not, put, on, an, equal, footing, with, their, roman, rulers, when, the, city, of, apamea, complained, of, an, audit, of, its, accounts, by, pliny, alleging, its, free, status, as, a, roman, colony, trajan, replied, by, writing, that, it, was, by, his, own, wish, that, such, inspections, had, been, ordered, concern, about, independent, local, political, activity, is, seen, in, trajan, s, decision, to, forbid, nicomedia, from, having, a, corps, of, firemen, if, people, assemble, for, a, common, purpose, they, soon, turn, it, into, a, political, society, trajan, wrote, to, pliny, as, well, as, in, his, and, pliny, s, fears, about, excessive, civic, generosities, by, local, notables, such, as, distribution, of, money, or, gifts, pliny, s, letters, suggest, that, trajan, and, his, aides, were, as, much, bored, as, they, were, alarmed, by, the, claims, of, dio, and, other, greek, notables, to, political, influence, based, on, what, they, saw, as, their, special, connection, to, their, roman, overlords, pliny, tells, of, dio, of, prusa, placing, a, statue, of, trajan, in, a, building, complex, where, dio, s, wife, and, son, were, buried, therefore, incurring, a, charge, of, treason, for, placing, the, emperor, s, statue, near, a, grave, trajan, however, dropped, the, charge, nevertheless, while, the, office, of, corrector, was, intended, as, a, tool, to, curb, any, hint, of, independent, political, activity, among, local, notables, in, the, greek, cities, the, correctores, themselves, were, all, men, of, the, highest, social, standing, entrusted, with, an, exceptional, commission, the, post, seems, to, have, been, conceived, partly, as, a, reward, for, senators, who, had, chosen, to, make, a, career, solely, on, the, emperor, s, behalf, therefore, in, reality, the, post, was, conceived, as, a, means, for, taming, both, greek, notables, and, roman, senators, it, must, be, added, that, although, trajan, was, wary, of, the, civic, oligarchies, in, the, greek, cities, he, also, admitted, into, the, senate, a, number, of, prominent, eastern, notables, already, slated, for, promotion, during, domitian, s, reign, by, reserving, for, them, one, of, the, twenty, posts, open, each, year, for, minor, magistrates, the, vigintiviri, such, must, be, the, case, of, the, galatian, notable, and, leading, member, of, the, greek, community, according, to, one, inscription, gaius, julius, severus, who, was, a, descendant, of, several, hellenistic, dynasts, and, client, kings, severus, was, the, grandfather, of, the, prominent, general, gaius, julius, quadratus, bassus, consul, in, 105, other, prominent, eastern, senators, included, gaius, julius, alexander, berenicianus, a, descendant, of, herod, the, great, suffect, consul, in, 116, trajan, created, at, least, fourteen, new, senators, from, the, greek, speaking, half, of, the, empire, an, unprecedented, recruitment, number, that, opens, to, question, the, issue, of, the, traditionally, roman, character, of, his, reign, as, well, as, the, hellenism, of, his, successor, hadrian, but, then, trajan, s, new, eastern, senators, were, mostly, very, powerful, and, very, wealthy, men, with, more, than, local, influence, and, much, interconnected, by, marriage, so, that, many, of, them, were, not, altogether, new, to, the, senate, on, the, local, level, among, the, lower, section, of, the, eastern, propertied, the, alienation, of, most, greek, notables, and, intellectuals, towards, roman, rule, and, the, fact, that, the, romans, were, seen, by, most, such, greek, notables, as, aliens, persisted, well, after, trajan, s, reign, one, of, trajan, s, senatorial, creations, from, the, east, the, athenian, gaius, julius, antiochus, epiphanes, philopappos, a, member, of, the, royal, house, of, commagene, left, behind, him, a, funeral, monument, on, the, mouseion, hill, that, was, later, disparagingly, described, by, pausanias, as, a, monument, built, to, a, syrian, man, as, a, senatorial, emperor, trajan, was, inclined, to, choose, his, local, base, of, political, support, from, among, the, members, of, the, ruling, urban, oligarchies, in, the, west, that, meant, local, senatorial, families, like, his, own, in, the, east, that, meant, the, families, of, greek, notables, the, greeks, though, had, their, own, memories, of, independence, and, a, commonly, acknowledged, sense, of, cultural, superiority, and, instead, of, seeing, themselves, as, roman, disdained, roman, rule, what, the, greek, oligarchies, wanted, from, rome, was, above, all, to, be, left, in, peace, to, be, allowed, to, exert, their, right, to, self, government, i, e, to, be, excluded, from, the, provincial, government, as, was, italy, and, to, concentrate, on, their, local, interests, this, was, something, the, romans, were, not, disposed, to, do, as, from, their, perspective, the, greek, notables, were, shunning, their, responsibilities, in, regard, to, the, management, of, imperial, affairs, primarily, in, failing, to, keep, the, common, people, under, control, thus, creating, the, need, for, the, roman, governor, to, intervene, an, excellent, example, of, this, greek, alienation, was, the, personal, role, played, by, dio, of, prusa, in, his, relationship, with, trajan, dio, is, described, by, philostratus, as, trajan, s, close, friend, and, trajan, as, supposedly, engaging, publicly, in, conversations, with, dio, nevertheless, as, a, greek, local, magnate, with, a, taste, for, costly, building, projects, and, pretensions, of, being, an, important, political, agent, for, rome, dio, of, prusa, was, actually, a, target, for, one, of, trajan, s, authoritarian, innovations, the, appointing, of, imperial, correctores, to, audit, the, civic, finances, of, the, technically, free, greek, cities, the, main, goal, was, to, curb, the, overenthusiastic, spending, on, public, works, that, served, to, channel, ancient, rivalries, between, neighbouring, cities, as, pliny, wrote, to, trajan, this, had, as, its, most, visible, consequence, a, trail, of, unfinished, or, ill, kept, public, utilities, competition, among, greek, cities, and, their, ruling, oligarchies, was, mainly, for, marks, of, pre, eminence, especially, for, titles, bestowed, by, the, roman, emperor, such, titles, were, ordered, in, a, ranking, system, that, determined, how, the, cities, were, to, be, outwardly, treated, by, rome, the, usual, form, that, such, rivalries, took, was, that, of, grandiose, building, plans, giving, the, cities, the, opportunity, to, vie, with, each, other, over, extravagant, needless, structures, that, would, make, a, show, a, side, effect, of, such, extravagant, spending, was, that, junior, and, thus, less, wealthy, members, of, the, local, oligarchies, felt, disinclined, to, present, themselves, to, fill, posts, as, local, magistrates, positions, that, involved, ever, increasing, personal, expense, roman, authorities, liked, to, play, the, greek, cities, against, one, another, something, of, which, dio, of, prusa, was, fully, aware, y, their, public, acts, have, branded, you, as, a, pack, of, fools, yes, they, treat, you, just, like, children, for, we, often, offer, children, the, most, trivial, things, in, place, of, things, of, greatest, worth, in, place, of, justice, in, place, of, the, freedom, of, the, cities, from, spoliation, or, from, the, seizure, of, the, private, possessions, of, their, inhabitants, in, place, of, their, refraining, from, insulting, you, your, governors, hand, you, titles, and, call, you, first, either, by, word, of, mouth, or, in, writing, that, done, they, may, thenceforth, with, impunity, treat, you, as, being, the, very, last, these, same, roman, authorities, had, also, an, interest, in, assuring, the, cities, solvency, and, therefore, ready, collection, of, imperial, taxes, last, but, not, least, inordinate, spending, on, civic, buildings, was, not, only, a, means, to, achieve, local, superiority, but, also, a, means, for, the, local, greek, elites, to, maintain, a, separate, cultural, identity, something, expressed, in, the, contemporary, rise, of, the, second, sophistic, this, cultural, patriotism, acted, as, a, kind, of, substitute, for, the, loss, of, political, independence, and, as, such, was, shunned, by, roman, authorities, as, trajan, himself, wrote, to, pliny, these, poor, greeks, all, love, a, gymnasium, they, will, have, to, content, with, one, that, suits, their, real, needs, the, first, known, corrector, was, charged, with, a, commission, to, deal, with, the, situation, of, the, free, cities, as, it, was, felt, that, the, old, method, of, ad, hoc, intervention, by, the, emperor, and, or, the, proconsuls, had, not, been, enough, to, curb, the, pretensions, of, the, greek, notables, it, is, noteworthy, that, an, embassy, from, dio, s, city, of, prusa, was, not, favourably, received, by, trajan, and, that, this, had, to, do, with, dio, s, chief, objective, which, was, to, elevate, prusa, to, the, status, of, a, free, city, an, independent, city, state, exempt, from, paying, taxes, to, rome, eventually, dio, gained, for, prusa, the, right, to, become, the, head, of, the, assize, district, conventus, meaning, that, prusans, did, not, have, to, travel, to, be, judged, by, the, roman, governor, but, eleutheria, freedom, in, the, sense, of, full, political, autonomy, was, denied, eventually, it, fell, to, pliny, as, imperial, governor, of, bithynia, in, ad, 110, to, deal, with, the, consequences, of, the, financial, mess, wrought, by, dio, and, his, fellow, civic, officials, it, s, well, established, that, are, in, a, state, of, disorder, pliny, once, wrote, to, trajan, plans, for, unnecessary, works, made, in, collusion, with, local, contractors, being, identified, as, one, of, the, main, problems, one, of, the, compensatory, measures, proposed, by, pliny, expressed, a, thoroughly, roman, conservative, position, as, the, cities, financial, solvency, depended, on, the, councilmen, s, purses, it, was, necessary, to, have, more, councilmen, on, the, local, city, councils, according, to, pliny, the, best, way, to, achieve, this, was, to, lower, the, minimum, age, for, holding, a, seat, on, the, council, making, it, possible, for, more, sons, of, the, established, oligarchical, families, to, join, and, thus, contribute, to, civic, spending, this, was, seen, as, preferable, to, enrolling, non, noble, wealthy, upstarts, such, an, increase, in, the, number, of, council, members, was, granted, to, dio, s, city, of, prusa, to, the, dismay, of, existing, councilmen, who, felt, their, status, lowered, a, similar, situation, existed, in, claudiopolis, where, a, public, bath, was, built, with, the, proceeds, from, the, entrance, fees, paid, by, supernumerary, members, of, the, council, enrolled, with, trajan, s, permission, according, to, the, digest, trajan, decreed, that, when, a, city, magistrate, promised, to, achieve, a, particular, public, building, his, heirs, inherited, responsibility, for, its, completion, trajan, was, a, prolific, builder, many, of, his, buildings, were, designed, and, erected, by, the, gifted, architect, apollodorus, of, damascus, including, a, massive, bridge, over, the, danube, which, the, roman, army, and, its, reinforcements, could, use, regardless, of, weather, the, danube, sometimes, froze, over, in, winter, but, seldom, enough, to, bear, the, passage, of, a, party, of, soldiers, trajan, s, works, at, the, iron, gates, region, of, the, danube, created, or, enlarged, the, boardwalk, road, cut, into, the, cliff, face, along, the, iron, gate, s, gorge, a, canal, was, built, between, the, danube, s, kasajna, tributary, and, ducis, pratum, circumventing, rapids, and, cataracts, trajan, s, forum, traiani, was, rome, s, largest, forum, it, was, built, to, commemorate, his, victories, in, dacia, and, was, largely, financed, from, that, campaign, s, loot, to, accommodate, it, parts, of, the, capitoline, and, quirinal, hills, had, to, be, removed, the, latter, enlarging, a, clear, area, first, established, by, domitian, apollodorus, of, damascus, magnificent, design, incorporated, a, triumphal, arch, entrance, a, forum, space, approximately, 120, m, long, and, 90m, wide, surrounded, by, peristyles, a, monumentally, sized, basilica, and, later, trajan, s, column, and, libraries, it, was, started, in, ad, 107, dedicated, on, 1, january, 112, and, remained, in, use, for, at, least, 500, years, it, still, drew, admiration, when, emperor, constantius, ii, visited, rome, in, the, fourth, century, it, accommodated, trajan, s, market, and, an, adjacent, brick, market, trajan, was, also, a, prolific, builder, of, triumphal, arches, many, of, which, survive, he, built, roads, such, as, the, via, traiana, an, extension, of, the, via, appia, from, beneventum, to, brundisium, and, the, via, traiana, nova, a, mostly, military, road, between, damascus, and, aila, which, rome, employed, in, its, annexation, of, nabataea, and, founding, of, arabia, province, some, historians, attribute, the, construction, or, reconstruction, of, old, cairo, s, roman, fortress, also, known, as, babylon, fort, to, trajan, and, the, building, of, a, canal, between, the, river, nile, and, the, red, sea, in, egypt, trajan, was, quite, active, in, constructing, and, embellishing, buildings, he, is, portrayed, together, with, domitian, on, the, propylon, of, the, temple, of, hathor, at, dendera, his, cartouche, also, appears, in, the, column, shafts, of, the, temple, of, khnum, at, esna, he, built, palatial, villas, outside, rome, at, arcinazzo, at, centumcellae, and, at, talamone, he, also, built, a, bath, complex, as, well, as, the, aqua, traiana, trajan, invested, heavily, in, the, provision, of, popular, amusements, he, carried, out, a, massive, reconstruction, of, the, circus, maximus, which, was, already, the, empire, s, biggest, and, best, appointed, circuit, for, the, immensely, popular, sport, of, chariot, racing, the, circus, also, hosted, religious, theatrical, spectacles, and, games, and, public, processions, on, a, grand, scale, trajan, s, reconstruction, completed, by, 103, was, modestly, described, by, trajan, himself, as, adequate, for, the, roman, people, it, replaced, flammable, wooden, seating, tiers, with, stone, and, increased, the, circus, already, vast, capacity, by, about, 5, 000, seats, its, lofty, elevated, imperial, viewing, box, was, rebuilt, among, the, seating, tiers, so, that, spectators, could, see, their, emperor, sharing, their, enjoyment, of, the, races, alongside, his, family, and, images, of, the, gods, at, some, time, during, 108, or, 109, trajan, held, 123, days, of, games, to, celebrate, his, dacian, victory, they, involved, fully, 10, 000, gladiators, and, the, slaughter, of, thousands, possibly, tens, of, thousands, of, animals, both, wild, and, domestic, trajan, s, careful, management, of, public, spectacles, led, the, orator, fronto, to, congratulate, him, for, paying, equal, attention, to, public, entertainments, and, more, serious, issues, acknowledging, that, neglect, of, serious, matters, can, cause, greater, damage, but, neglect, of, amusements, greater, discontent, state, funded, public, entertainments, helped, to, maintain, contentment, among, the, populace, the, more, serious, matter, of, the, corn, dole, aimed, to, satisfy, individuals, during, the, period, of, peace, that, followed, the, dacian, war, trajan, exchanged, letters, with, pliny, the, younger, on, how, best, to, deal, with, the, christians, of, pontus, trajan, told, pliny, to, continue, prosecutions, of, christians, if, they, merited, that, but, not, to, accept, anonymous, or, malicious, denunciations, he, considered, this, to, be, in, the, interests, of, justice, and, to, reflect, the, spirit, of, the, age, non, citizens, who, admitted, to, being, christians, and, refused, to, recant, were, to, be, executed, for, obstinacy, citizens, were, sent, to, rome, for, trial, further, tests, faced, by, christians, in, pontus, are, alluded, to, in, correspondence, between, pliny, the, younger, governor, of, the, roman, province, of, bithynia, and, pontus, and, emperor, trajan, writing, from, pontus, in, about, ad, 112, pliny, reported, that, the, contagion, of, christianity, threatened, everyone, regardless, of, gender, age, or, rank, pliny, gave, those, accused, of, being, christians, opportunity, to, deny, it, and, those, who, would, not, he, executed, any, who, cursed, christ, or, recited, a, prayer, to, the, gods, or, to, trajan, s, statue, were, released, pliny, acknowledged, that, these, were, things, that, those, who, are, really, christians, cannot, be, made, to, do, in, 107, trajan, devalued, the, roman, currency, decreasing, the, silver, content, of, the, denarius, from, 93, 5, to, 89, 0, the, actual, silver, weight, dropping, from, 3, 04, grams, to, 2, 88, grams, this, devaluation, along, with, the, massive, amounts, of, gold, and, silver, acquired, through, his, dacian, wars, allowed, trajan, to, mint, many, more, denarii, than, his, predecessors, he, also, withdrew, from, circulation, silver, denarii, minted, before, nero, s, devaluation, trajan, s, devaluation, may, have, had, a, political, intent, enabling, planned, increases, in, civil, and, military, spending, trajan, formalised, the, alimenta, a, welfare, program, that, helped, orphans, and, poor, children, throughout, italy, by, providing, cash, food, and, subsidized, education, the, program, was, supported, out, of, dacian, war, booty, estate, taxes, and, philanthropy, the, alimenta, also, relied, indirectly, on, mortgages, secured, against, italian, farms, fundi, registered, landowners, received, a, lump, sum, from, the, imperial, treasury, and, in, return, were, expected, to, repay, an, annual, sum, to, support, the, alimentary, fund, the, earliest, of, trajan, s, conquests, were, rome, s, two, wars, against, dacia, an, area, that, had, troubled, roman, politics, for, over, a, decade, in, regard, to, the, unstable, peace, negotiated, by, domitian, s, ministers, with, the, powerful, dacian, king, decebalus, dacia, would, be, reduced, by, trajan, s, rome, to, a, client, kingdom, in, the, first, war, 101, 102, followed, by, a, second, war, that, ended, in, actual, incorporation, into, the, empire, of, the, trans, danube, border, group, of, dacia, according, to, the, provisions, of, decebalus, s, earlier, treaty, with, rome, made, in, the, time, of, domitian, decebalus, was, acknowledged, as, rex, amicus, that, is, client, king, in, exchange, for, accepting, client, status, he, received, from, rome, both, a, generous, stipend, and, a, steady, supply, of, technical, experts, the, treaty, seems, to, have, allowed, roman, troops, the, right, of, passage, through, the, dacian, kingdom, in, order, to, attack, the, marcomanni, quadi, and, sarmatians, however, senatorial, opinion, never, forgave, domitian, for, paying, what, was, seen, as, tribute, to, a, barbarian, king, unlike, the, germanic, tribes, the, dacian, kingdom, was, an, organized, state, capable, of, developing, alliances, of, its, own, thus, making, it, a, strategic, threat, and, giving, trajan, a, strong, motive, to, attack, it, in, may, of, 101, trajan, launched, his, first, campaign, into, the, dacian, kingdom, crossing, to, the, northern, bank, of, the, danube, and, defeating, the, dacian, army, at, tapae, see, second, battle, of, tapae, near, the, iron, gates, of, transylvania, it, was, not, a, decisive, victory, however, trajan, s, troops, took, heavy, losses, in, the, encounter, and, he, put, off, further, campaigning, for, the, year, in, order, to, regroup, and, reinforce, his, army, nevertheless, the, battle, was, considered, a, roman, victory, and, trajan, strived, to, ultimately, consolidate, his, position, including, other, major, engagements, as, well, as, the, capture, of, decebalus, sister, as, depicted, on, trajan, s, column, the, following, winter, decebalus, took, the, initiative, by, launching, a, counter, attack, across, the, danube, further, downstream, supported, by, sarmatian, cavalry, forcing, trajan, to, come, to, the, aid, of, the, troops, in, his, rearguard, the, dacians, and, their, allies, were, repulsed, after, two, battles, in, moesia, at, nicopolis, ad, istrum, and, adamclisi, trajan, s, army, then, advanced, further, into, dacian, territory, and, a, year, later, forced, decebalus, to, submit, he, had, to, renounce, claim, to, some, regions, of, his, kingdom, return, runaways, from, rome, then, under, his, protection, most, of, them, technical, experts, and, surrender, all, his, war, machines, trajan, returned, to, rome, in, triumph, and, was, granted, the, title, dacicus, the, peace, of, 102, had, returned, decebalus, to, the, condition, of, more, or, less, harmless, client, king, however, he, soon, began, to, rearm, to, again, harbour, roman, runaways, and, to, pressure, his, western, neighbours, the, iazyges, sarmatians, into, allying, themselves, with, him, through, his, efforts, to, develop, an, anti, roman, bloc, decebalus, prevented, trajan, from, treating, dacia, as, a, protectorate, instead, of, an, outright, conquest, in, 104, decebalus, devised, an, attempt, on, trajan, s, life, by, means, of, some, roman, deserters, a, plan, that, failed, decebalus, also, took, prisoner, trajan, s, legate, longinus, who, eventually, poisoned, himself, while, in, custody, finally, in, 105, decebalus, undertook, an, invasion, of, roman, occupied, territory, north, of, the, danube, prior, to, the, campaign, trajan, had, raised, two, entirely, new, legions, ii, traiana, which, however, may, have, been, posted, in, the, east, at, the, syrian, port, of, laodicea, and, xxx, ulpia, victrix, which, was, posted, to, brigetio, in, pannonia, by, 105, the, concentration, of, roman, troops, assembled, in, the, middle, and, lower, danube, amounted, to, fourteen, legions, up, from, nine, in, 101, about, half, of, the, entire, roman, army, even, after, the, dacian, wars, the, danube, frontier, would, permanently, replace, the, rhine, as, the, main, military, axis, of, the, roman, empire, including, auxiliaries, the, number, of, roman, troops, engaged, on, both, campaigns, was, between, 150, 000, and, 175, 000, while, decebalus, could, dispose, of, up, to, 200, 000, other, estimates, for, the, roman, forces, involved, in, trajan, s, second, dacian, war, cite, around, 86, 000, for, active, campaigning, with, large, reserves, retained, in, the, proximal, provinces, and, potentially, much, lower, numbers, around, 50, 000, for, decebalus, depleted, forces, and, absent, allies, in, a, fierce, campaign, that, seems, to, have, consisted, mostly, of, static, warfare, the, dacians, devoid, of, manoeuvring, room, kept, to, their, network, of, fortresses, which, the, romans, sought, systematically, to, storm, see, also, second, dacian, war, the, romans, gradually, tightened, their, grip, around, decebalus, stronghold, in, sarmizegetusa, regia, which, they, finally, took, and, destroyed, a, controversial, scene, on, trajan, s, column, just, before, the, fall, of, sarmizegetusa, regia, suggests, that, decebalus, may, have, offered, poison, to, his, remaining, men, as, an, alternative, option, to, capture, or, death, while, trying, to, flee, the, besieged, capital, with, him, decebalus, fled, but, when, later, cornered, by, roman, cavalry, committed, suicide, his, severed, head, brought, to, trajan, by, the, cavalryman, tiberius, claudius, maximus, was, later, exhibited, in, rome, on, the, steps, leading, up, to, the, capitol, and, thrown, on, the, gemonian, stairs, the, famous, dacian, treasures, were, not, found, in, the, captured, capital, and, their, whereabouts, were, only, revealed, when, a, dacian, nobleman, called, bikilis, was, captured, decebalus, treasures, had, been, buried, under, a, temporarily, diverted, river, and, the, captive, workers, executed, to, retain, the, secret, staggering, amounts, of, gold, and, silver, were, found, and, packed, off, to, fill, rome, s, coffers, trajan, built, a, new, city, colonia, ulpia, traiana, augusta, dacica, sarmizegetusa, on, another, site, north, of, the, hill, citadel, holding, the, previous, dacian, capital, although, bearing, the, same, full, name, sarmizegetusa, this, capital, city, was, conceived, as, a, purely, civilian, administrative, centre, and, was, provided, the, usual, romanized, administrative, apparatus, decurions, aediles, etc, urban, life, in, roman, dacia, seems, to, have, been, restricted, to, roman, colonists, mostly, military, veterans, there, is, no, extant, evidence, for, the, existence, in, the, province, of, peregrine, cities, native, dacians, continued, to, live, in, scattered, rural, settlements, according, to, their, own, ways, in, another, arrangement, with, no, parallels, in, any, other, roman, province, the, existing, quasi, urban, dacian, settlements, disappeared, after, the, roman, conquest, a, number, of, unorganized, urban, settlements, vici, developed, around, military, encampments, in, dacia, proper, the, most, important, being, apulum, but, were, only, acknowledged, as, cities, proper, well, after, trajan, s, reign, the, main, regional, effort, of, urbanization, was, concentrated, by, trajan, at, the, rearguard, in, moesia, where, he, created, the, new, cities, of, nicopolis, ad, istrum, and, marcianopolis, a, vicus, was, also, created, around, the, tropaeum, traianum, the, garrison, city, of, oescus, received, the, status, of, roman, colony, after, its, legionary, garrison, was, redeployed, the, fact, that, these, former, danubian, outposts, had, ceased, to, be, frontier, bases, and, were, now, in, the, deep, rear, acted, as, an, inducement, to, their, urbanization, and, development, not, all, of, dacia, was, permanently, occupied, after, the, post, trajanic, evacuation, of, lands, across, the, lower, danube, land, extending, from, the, danube, to, the, inner, arch, of, the, carpathian, mountains, including, transylvania, the, metaliferi, mountains, and, oltenia, was, absorbed, into, the, roman, province, which, eventually, took, the, form, of, an, excrescence, with, ill, defined, limits, stretching, from, the, danube, northwards, to, the, carpathians, this, may, have, been, intended, as, a, basis, for, further, expansion, within, eastern, europe, as, the, romans, believed, the, region, to, be, much, more, geographically, flattened, and, thus, easier, to, traverse, than, it, actually, was, they, also, underestimated, the, distance, from, those, vaguely, defined, borders, to, the, ocean, defence, of, the, province, was, entrusted, to, a, single, legion, the, xiii, gemina, stationed, at, apulum, which, functioned, as, an, advance, guard, that, could, in, case, of, need, strike, either, west, or, east, at, the, sarmatians, living, at, the, borders, therefore, the, indefensible, character, of, the, province, did, not, appear, to, be, a, problem, for, trajan, as, the, province, was, conceived, more, as, a, sally, base, for, further, attacks, even, in, the, absence, of, further, roman, expansion, the, value, of, the, province, depended, on, roman, overall, strength, while, rome, was, strong, the, dacian, salient, was, an, instrument, of, military, and, diplomatic, control, over, the, danubian, lands, when, rome, was, weak, as, during, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, the, province, became, a, liability, and, was, eventually, abandoned, trajan, resettled, dacia, with, romans, and, annexed, it, as, a, province, of, the, roman, empire, aside, from, their, enormous, booty, over, half, a, million, slaves, according, to, john, lydus, trajan, s, dacian, campaigns, benefited, the, empire, s, finances, through, the, acquisition, of, dacia, s, gold, mines, managed, by, an, imperial, procurator, of, equestrian, rank, procurator, aurariarum, on, the, other, hand, commercial, agricultural, exploitation, on, the, villa, model, based, on, the, centralized, management, of, a, huge, landed, estate, by, a, single, owner, fundus, was, poorly, developed, therefore, use, of, slave, labor, in, the, province, itself, seems, to, have, been, relatively, undeveloped, and, epigraphic, evidence, points, to, work, in, the, gold, mines, being, conducted, by, means, of, labor, contracts, locatio, conductio, rei, and, seasonal, wage, earning, the, victory, was, commemorated, by, the, construction, both, of, the, 102, cenotaph, generally, known, as, the, tropaeum, traiani, in, moesia, as, well, of, the, much, later, 113, trajan, s, column, in, rome, the, latter, depicting, in, stone, carved, bas, reliefs, the, dacian, wars, most, important, moments, in, 106, rabbel, ii, soter, one, of, rome, s, client, kings, died, this, event, might, have, prompted, the, annexation, of, the, nabataean, kingdom, but, the, manner, and, the, formal, reasons, for, the, annexation, are, unclear, some, epigraphic, evidence, suggests, a, military, operation, with, forces, from, syria, and, egypt, what, is, known, is, that, by, 107, roman, legions, were, stationed, in, the, area, around, petra, and, bosra, as, is, shown, by, a, papyrus, found, in, egypt, the, furthest, south, the, romans, occupied, or, better, garrisoned, adopting, a, policy, of, having, garrisons, at, key, points, in, the, desert, was, hegra, over, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, south, west, of, petra, the, empire, gained, what, became, the, province, of, arabia, petraea, modern, southern, jordan, and, northwest, saudi, arabia, at, this, time, a, roman, road, via, traiana, nova, was, built, from, aila, now, aqaba, in, limes, arabicus, to, bosrah, as, nabataea, was, the, last, client, kingdom, in, asia, west, of, the, euphrates, the, annexation, meant, that, the, entire, roman, east, had, been, provincialized, completing, a, trend, towards, direct, rule, that, had, begun, under, the, flavians, in, 113, trajan, embarked, on, his, last, campaign, provoked, by, parthia, s, decision, to, put, an, unacceptable, king, on, the, throne, of, armenia, a, kingdom, over, which, the, two, great, empires, had, shared, hegemony, since, the, time, of, nero, some, fifty, years, earlier, trajan, already, in, syria, early, in, 113, consistently, refused, to, accept, diplomatic, approaches, from, the, parthians, intended, to, settle, the, armenian, imbroglio, peacefully, as, the, surviving, literary, accounts, of, trajan, s, parthian, war, are, fragmentary, and, scattered, it, is, difficult, to, assign, them, a, proper, context, something, that, has, led, to, a, long, running, controversy, about, its, precise, happenings, and, ultimate, aims, modern, historians, advance, the, possibility, that, trajan, s, decision, to, wage, war, against, parthia, had, economic, motives, after, trajan, s, annexation, of, arabia, he, built, a, new, road, via, traiana, nova, that, went, from, bostra, to, aila, on, the, red, sea, that, meant, that, charax, on, the, persian, gulf, was, the, sole, remaining, western, terminus, of, the, indian, trade, route, outside, direct, roman, control, and, such, control, was, important, in, order, to, lower, import, prices, and, to, limit, the, supposed, drain, of, precious, metals, created, by, the, deficit, in, roman, trade, with, the, far, east, that, charax, traded, with, the, roman, empire, there, can, be, no, doubt, as, its, actual, connections, with, merchants, from, palmyra, during, the, period, are, well, documented, in, a, contemporary, palmyrene, epigraph, which, tells, of, various, palmyrene, citizens, honoured, for, holding, office, in, charax, also, charax, s, rulers, domains, at, the, time, possibly, included, the, bahrain, islands, which, offered, the, possibility, of, extending, roman, hegemony, into, the, persian, gulf, itself, a, palmyrene, citizen, held, office, as, satrap, over, the, islands, shortly, after, trajan, s, death, though, the, appointment, was, made, by, a, parthian, king, of, charax, the, rationale, behind, trajan, s, campaign, in, this, case, was, one, of, breaking, down, a, system, of, far, eastern, trade, through, small, semitic, arab, cities, under, parthia, s, control, and, to, put, it, under, roman, control, instead, in, his, dacian, conquests, trajan, had, already, resorted, to, syrian, auxiliary, units, whose, veterans, along, with, syrian, traders, had, an, important, role, in, the, subsequent, colonization, of, dacia, he, had, recruited, palmyrene, units, into, his, army, including, a, camel, unit, therefore, apparently, procuring, palmyrene, support, to, his, ultimate, goal, of, annexing, charax, it, has, even, been, ventured, that, when, earlier, in, his, campaign, trajan, annexed, armenia, he, was, bound, to, annex, the, whole, of, mesopotamia, lest, the, parthians, interrupt, the, flux, of, trade, from, the, persian, gulf, and, or, foment, trouble, at, the, roman, frontier, on, the, danube, other, historians, reject, these, motives, as, the, supposed, parthian, control, over, the, maritime, far, eastern, trade, route, was, at, best, conjectural, and, based, on, a, selective, reading, of, chinese, sources, trade, by, land, through, parthia, seems, to, have, been, unhampered, by, parthian, authorities, and, left, solely, to, the, devices, of, private, enterprise, commercial, activity, in, second, century, mesopotamia, seems, to, have, been, a, general, phenomenon, shared, by, many, peoples, within, and, without, the, roman, empire, with, no, sign, of, a, concerted, imperial, policy, towards, it, as, in, the, case, of, the, alimenta, scholars, like, moses, finley, and, paul, veyne, have, considered, the, idea, that, a, foreign, trade, policy, underlay, trajan, s, war, to, be, anachronistic, according, to, these, scholars, the, concern, of, roman, leaders, with, the, trade, in, far, eastern, luxuries, besides, collecting, toll, taxes, and, customs, was, moral, in, nature, because, contemporary, roman, mores, frowned, upon, the, softness, of, luxuries, in, the, absence, of, conclusive, evidence, trade, between, rome, and, india, might, have, been, far, more, balanced, in, terms, of, quantities, of, precious, metals, exchanged, one, of, our, sources, for, the, notion, of, the, roman, gold, drain, pliny, s, the, younger, s, uncle, pliny, the, elder, had, earlier, described, the, gangetic, plains, as, one, of, the, gold, sources, for, the, roman, empire, accordingly, in, a, controversial, book, on, the, roman, economy, finley, considers, trajan, s, badly, miscalculated, and, expensive, assault, on, parthia, to, be, an, example, of, the, many, roman, commercial, wars, that, had, in, common, the, fact, of, existing, only, in, the, books, of, modern, historians, the, alternative, view, is, to, see, the, campaign, as, triggered, by, the, lure, of, territorial, annexation, and, prestige, the, sole, motive, ascribed, by, cassius, dio, as, far, as, territorial, conquest, involved, tax, collecting, especially, of, the, 25, tax, levied, on, all, goods, entering, the, roman, empire, the, tetarte, one, can, say, that, trajan, s, parthian, war, had, an, economic, motive, also, there, was, the, propaganda, value, of, an, eastern, conquest, that, would, emulate, in, roman, fashion, those, of, alexander, the, great, the, fact, that, emissaries, from, the, kushan, empire, might, have, attended, to, the, commemorative, ceremonies, for, the, dacian, war, may, have, kindled, in, some, greco, roman, intellectuals, like, plutarch, who, wrote, about, only, 70, 000, roman, soldiers, being, necessary, to, a, conquest, of, india, as, well, as, in, trajan, s, closer, associates, speculative, dreams, about, the, booty, to, be, obtained, by, reproducing, macedonian, eastern, conquests, there, could, also, be, trajan, s, idea, to, use, an, ambitious, blueprint, of, conquests, as, a, way, to, emphasize, quasi, divine, status, such, as, with, his, cultivated, association, in, coins, and, monuments, to, hercules, also, it, is, possible, that, the, attachment, of, trajan, to, an, expansionist, policy, was, supported, by, a, powerful, circle, of, conservative, senators, from, hispania, committed, to, a, policy, of, imperial, expansion, first, among, them, being, the, all, powerful, licinius, sura, alternatively, one, can, explain, the, campaign, by, the, fact, that, for, the, romans, their, empire, was, in, principle, unlimited, and, that, trajan, only, took, advantage, of, an, opportunity, to, make, idea, and, reality, coincide, finally, there, are, other, modern, historians, who, think, that, trajan, s, original, aims, were, purely, military, and, strategic, to, assure, a, more, defensible, eastern, frontier, for, the, roman, empire, crossing, northern, mesopotamia, along, the, course, of, the, khabur, river, in, order, to, offer, cover, to, a, roman, armenia, this, interpretation, is, backed, by, the, fact, that, all, subsequent, roman, wars, against, parthia, would, aim, at, establishing, a, roman, presence, deep, into, parthia, itself, it, is, possible, that, during, the, onset, of, trajan, s, military, experience, as, a, young, tribune, he, had, witnessed, engagement, with, the, parthians, so, any, strategic, vision, was, grounded, in, a, tactical, awareness, of, what, was, needed, to, tackle, parthia, the, campaign, was, carefully, planned, in, advance, ten, legions, were, concentrated, in, the, eastern, theatre, since, 111, the, correspondence, of, pliny, the, younger, witnesses, to, the, fact, that, provincial, authorities, in, bithynia, had, to, organize, supplies, for, passing, troops, and, local, city, councils, and, their, individual, members, had, to, shoulder, part, of, the, increased, expenses, by, supplying, troops, themselves, the, intended, campaign, therefore, was, immensely, costly, from, its, very, beginning, trajan, marched, first, on, armenia, deposed, the, parthian, appointed, king, parthamasiris, who, was, afterwards, murdered, while, kept, in, the, custody, of, roman, troops, in, an, unclear, incident, later, described, by, fronto, as, a, breach, of, roman, good, faith, and, annexed, it, to, the, roman, empire, as, a, province, receiving, in, passing, the, acknowledgement, of, roman, hegemony, by, various, tribes, in, the, caucasus, and, on, the, eastern, coast, of, the, black, sea, a, process, that, kept, him, busy, until, the, end, of, 114, at, the, same, time, a, roman, column, under, the, legate, lusius, quietus, an, outstanding, cavalry, general, who, had, signalled, himself, during, the, dacian, wars, by, commanding, a, unit, from, his, native, mauretania, crossed, the, araxes, river, from, armenia, into, media, atropatene, and, the, land, of, the, mardians, present, day, ghilan, it, is, possible, that, quietus, campaign, had, as, its, goal, the, extending, of, the, newer, more, defensible, roman, border, eastwards, towards, the, caspian, sea, and, northwards, to, the, foothills, of, the, caucasus, this, newer, more, rational, frontier, depended, however, on, an, increased, permanent, roman, presence, east, of, the, euphrates, the, chronology, of, subsequent, events, is, uncertain, but, it, is, generally, believed, that, early, in, 115, trajan, launched, a, mesopotamian, campaign, marching, down, towards, the, taurus, mountains, in, order, to, consolidate, territory, between, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, he, placed, permanent, garrisons, along, the, way, to, secure, the, territory, while, trajan, moved, from, west, to, east, lusius, quietus, moved, with, his, army, from, the, caspian, sea, towards, the, west, both, armies, performing, a, successful, pincer, movement, whose, apparent, result, was, to, establish, a, roman, presence, into, the, parthian, empire, proper, with, trajan, taking, the, northern, mesopotamian, cities, of, nisibis, and, batnae, and, organizing, a, province, of, mesopotamia, including, the, kingdom, of, osrhoene, where, king, abgar, vii, submitted, to, trajan, publicly, as, a, roman, protectorate, this, process, seems, to, have, been, completed, at, the, beginning, of, 116, when, coins, were, issued, announcing, that, armenia, and, mesopotamia, had, been, put, under, the, authority, of, the, roman, people, the, area, between, the, khabur, river, and, the, mountains, around, singara, seems, to, have, been, considered, as, the, new, frontier, and, as, such, received, a, road, surrounded, by, fortresses, after, wintering, in, antioch, during, 115, 116, and, according, to, literary, sources, barely, escaping, from, a, violent, earthquake, that, claimed, the, life, of, one, of, the, consuls, marcus, pedo, virgilianus, trajan, again, took, to, the, field, in, 116, with, a, view, to, the, conquest, of, the, whole, of, mesopotamia, an, overambitious, goal, that, eventually, backfired, on, the, results, of, his, entire, campaign, according, to, some, modern, historians, the, aim, of, the, campaign, of, 116, was, to, achieve, a, pre, emptive, demonstration, aiming, not, toward, the, conquest, of, parthia, but, for, tighter, roman, control, over, the, eastern, trade, route, however, the, overall, scarcity, of, manpower, for, the, roman, military, establishment, meant, that, the, campaign, was, doomed, from, the, start, it, is, noteworthy, that, no, new, legions, were, raised, by, trajan, before, the, parthian, campaign, maybe, because, the, sources, of, new, citizen, recruits, were, already, over, exploited, as, far, as, the, sources, allow, a, description, of, this, campaign, it, seems, that, one, roman, division, crossed, the, tigris, into, adiabene, sweeping, south, and, capturing, adenystrae, a, second, followed, the, river, south, capturing, babylon, trajan, himself, sailed, down, the, euphrates, from, dura, europos, where, a, triumphal, arch, was, erected, in, his, honour, through, ozogardana, where, he, erected, a, tribunal, still, to, be, seen, at, the, time, of, julian, the, apostate, s, campaigns, in, the, same, area, having, come, to, the, narrow, strip, of, land, between, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, he, then, dragged, his, fleet, overland, into, the, tigris, capturing, seleucia, and, finally, the, parthian, capital, of, ctesiphon, he, continued, southward, to, the, persian, gulf, when, after, escaping, with, his, fleet, a, tidal, bore, on, the, tigris, he, received, the, submission, of, athambelus, the, ruler, of, charax, he, declared, babylon, a, new, province, of, the, empire, and, had, his, statue, erected, on, the, shore, of, the, persian, gulf, after, which, he, sent, the, senate, a, laurelled, letter, declaring, the, war, to, be, at, a, close, and, bemoaning, that, he, was, too, old, to, go, on, any, further, and, repeat, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, since, charax, was, a, de, facto, independent, kingdom, whose, connections, to, palmyra, were, described, above, trajan, s, bid, for, the, persian, gulf, may, have, coincided, with, palmyrene, interests, in, the, region, another, hypothesis, is, that, the, rulers, of, charax, had, expansionist, designs, on, parthian, babylon, giving, them, a, rationale, for, alliance, with, trajan, the, parthian, city, of, susa, was, apparently, also, occupied, by, the, romans, according, to, late, literary, sources, not, backed, by, numismatic, or, inscriptional, evidence, a, province, of, assyria, was, also, proclaimed, apparently, covering, the, territory, of, adiabene, some, measures, seem, to, have, been, considered, regarding, the, fiscal, administration, of, indian, trade, or, simply, about, the, payment, of, customs, portoria, on, goods, traded, on, the, euphrates, and, tigris, it, is, possible, that, it, was, this, streamlining, of, the, administration, of, the, newly, conquered, lands, according, to, the, standard, pattern, of, roman, provincial, administration, in, tax, collecting, requisitions, and, the, handling, of, local, potentates, prerogatives, that, triggered, later, resistance, against, trajan, according, to, some, modern, historians, trajan, might, have, busied, himself, during, his, stay, on, the, persian, gulf, with, ordering, raids, on, the, parthian, coasts, as, well, as, probing, into, extending, roman, suzerainty, over, the, mountaineer, tribes, holding, the, passes, across, the, zagros, mountains, into, the, iranian, plateau, eastward, as, well, as, establishing, some, sort, of, direct, contact, between, rome, and, the, kushan, empire, no, attempt, was, made, to, expand, into, the, iranian, plateau, itself, where, the, roman, army, with, its, relative, weakness, in, cavalry, would, have, been, at, a, disadvantage, trajan, left, the, persian, gulf, for, babylon, where, he, intended, to, offer, sacrifice, to, alexander, in, the, house, where, he, had, died, in, 323, bc, but, a, revolt, led, by, sanatruces, a, nephew, of, the, parthian, king, osroes, i, who, had, retained, a, cavalry, force, possibly, strengthened, by, the, addition, of, saka, archers, imperilled, roman, positions, in, mesopotamia, and, armenia, trajan, sought, to, deal, with, this, by, forsaking, direct, roman, rule, in, parthia, proper, at, least, partially, trajan, sent, two, armies, towards, northern, mesopotamia, the, first, under, lusius, quietus, recovered, nisibis, and, edessa, from, the, rebels, probably, having, king, abgarus, deposed, and, killed, in, the, process, with, quietus, probably, earning, the, right, to, receive, the, honors, of, a, senator, of, praetorian, rank, adlectus, inter, praetorios, the, second, army, however, under, appius, maximus, santra, probably, a, governor, of, macedonia, was, defeated, and, santra, killed, later, in, 116, trajan, with, the, assistance, of, quietus, and, two, other, legates, marcus, erucius, clarus, and, tiberius, julius, alexander, julianus, defeated, a, parthian, army, in, a, battle, where, sanatruces, was, killed, possibly, with, the, assistance, of, osroes, son, and, sanatruces, cousin, parthamaspates, whom, trajan, wooed, successfully, after, re, taking, and, burning, seleucia, trajan, then, formally, deposed, osroes, putting, parthamaspates, on, the, throne, as, client, ruler, this, event, was, commemorated, in, a, coin, as, the, reduction, of, parthia, to, client, kingdom, status, rex, parthis, datus, a, king, is, given, to, the, parthians, that, done, trajan, retreated, north, in, order, to, retain, what, he, could, of, the, new, provinces, of, armenia, where, he, had, already, accepted, an, armistice, in, exchange, for, surrendering, part, of, the, territory, to, sanatruces, son, vologeses, and, mesopotamia, it, was, at, this, point, that, trajan, s, health, started, to, fail, him, the, fortress, city, of, hatra, on, the, tigris, in, his, rear, continued, to, hold, out, against, repeated, roman, assaults, he, was, personally, present, at, the, siege, and, it, is, possible, that, he, suffered, a, heat, stroke, while, in, the, blazing, heat, about, this, same, time, ad, 116, 117, jews, in, the, eastern, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, egypt, cyprus, and, cyrene, which, was, likely, the, original, trouble, hotspot, rebelled, in, what, appears, to, have, been, an, ethnic, and, religious, uprising, against, the, local, populations, later, known, as, the, diaspora, revolt, additionally, jewish, communities, in, northern, mesopotamia, revolted, likely, as, part, of, a, broader, resistance, against, roman, occupation, trajan, had, to, withdraw, his, army, to, suppress, these, revolts, a, move, he, considered, a, temporary, setback, he, never, returned, to, command, delegating, eastern, operations, to, lusius, quietus, who, was, appointed, governor, of, judaea, in, early, 117, and, likely, dealt, with, jewish, unrest, there, quietus, discharged, his, commissions, successfully, leading, rabbinic, sources, to, name, the, conflict, in, judaea, the, kitos, war, with, kitus, being, a, corruption, of, quietus, whether, or, not, the, diaspora, revolt, included, judea, proper, or, only, the, jewish, eastern, diaspora, remains, doubtful, in, the, absence, of, clear, epigraphic, and, archaeological, evidence, what, is, certain, is, that, there, was, an, increased, roman, military, presence, in, judea, at, the, time, quietus, was, promised, a, consulate, in, the, following, year, 118, for, his, victories, but, he, was, killed, before, this, could, occur, during, the, bloody, purge, that, opened, hadrian, s, reign, in, which, quietus, and, three, other, former, consuls, were, sentenced, to, death, after, being, tried, on, a, vague, charge, of, conspiracy, by, the, secret, court, of, the, praetorian, prefect, attianus, it, has, been, thought, that, quietus, and, his, colleagues, were, executed, on, hadrian, s, direct, orders, for, fear, of, their, popular, standing, with, the, army, and, their, close, connections, to, trajan, in, contrast, the, next, prominent, roman, figure, in, charge, of, the, repression, of, the, jewish, revolt, the, equestrian, quintus, marcius, turbo, who, had, dealt, with, the, rebel, leader, from, cyrene, loukuas, retained, hadrian, s, trust, eventually, becoming, his, praetorian, prefect, as, all, four, consulars, were, senators, of, the, highest, standing, and, as, such, generally, regarded, as, able, to, take, imperial, power, capaces, imperii, hadrian, seems, to, have, decided, to, forestall, these, prospective, rivals, early, in, 117, trajan, grew, ill, and, set, sail, for, italy, his, health, declined, throughout, the, spring, and, summer, of, 117, possibly, acknowledged, to, the, public, by, the, display, of, a, bronze, portrait, bust, at, the, public, baths, of, ancyra, showing, an, aged, and, emaciated, man, though, the, identification, with, trajan, is, disputed, he, reached, selinus, where, he, suddenly, died, shortly, before, 11, august, trajan, in, person, could, have, lawfully, nominated, hadrian, as, his, successor, but, dio, claims, that, trajan, s, wife, pompeia, plotina, assured, hadrian, s, succession, by, keeping, trajan, s, death, a, secret, long, enough, for, her, to, produce, and, sign, a, document, attesting, to, hadrian, s, adoption, as, son, and, successor, dio, who, tells, this, narrative, offers, his, father, the, governor, of, cilicia, apronianus, as, a, source, so, his, narrative, may, be, based, on, contemporary, rumour, it, may, also, reflect, male, roman, displeasure, that, an, empress, let, alone, any, woman, could, presume, to, meddle, in, rome, s, political, affairs, hadrian, held, an, ambiguous, position, during, trajan, s, reign, after, commanding, legio, i, minervia, during, the, dacian, wars, he, had, been, relieved, from, front, line, duties, at, the, decisive, stage, of, the, second, dacian, war, being, sent, to, govern, the, newly, created, province, of, pannonia, inferior, he, had, pursued, a, senatorial, career, without, particular, distinction, and, had, not, been, officially, adopted, by, trajan, although, he, received, from, him, decorations, and, other, marks, of, distinction, that, made, him, hope, for, the, succession, he, received, no, post, after, his, 108, consulate, and, no, further, honours, other, than, being, made, archon, eponymos, for, athens, in, 111, 112, he, probably, did, not, take, part, in, the, parthian, war, literary, sources, relate, that, trajan, had, considered, others, such, as, the, jurist, lucius, neratius, priscus, as, heir, hadrian, who, was, eventually, entrusted, with, the, governorship, of, syria, at, the, time, of, trajan, s, death, was, trajan, s, cousin, and, was, married, to, trajan, s, grandniece, which, all, made, him, as, good, as, heir, designate, hadrian, seems, to, have, been, well, connected, to, the, powerful, and, influential, coterie, of, spanish, senators, at, trajan, s, court, through, his, ties, to, plotina, and, the, prefect, attianus, his, refusal, to, sustain, trajan, s, senatorial, and, expansionist, policy, during, his, own, reign, may, account, for, the, crass, hostility, shown, him, by, literary, sources, hadrian, s, first, major, act, as, emperor, was, to, abandon, mesopotamia, as, too, costly, and, distant, to, defend, and, to, restore, armenia, and, osrhoene, to, parthian, hegemony, under, rome, s, suzerainty, the, parthian, campaign, had, been, an, enormous, setback, to, trajan, s, policy, proof, that, rome, had, overstretched, its, capacity, to, sustain, an, ambitious, program, of, conquest, according, to, the, historia, augusta, hadrian, claimed, to, follow, the, precedent, set, by, cato, the, elder, towards, the, macedonians, who, were, to, be, set, free, because, they, could, not, be, protected, something, birley, sees, as, an, unconvincing, precedent, other, territories, conquered, by, trajan, were, retained, according, to, a, well, established, historical, tradition, trajan, s, ashes, were, placed, within, the, small, cella, that, still, survives, at, the, base, of, trajan, s, column, in, some, modern, scholarship, his, ashes, were, more, likely, interred, near, his, column, in, a, mausoleum, temple, or, tomb, built, for, his, cult, as, a, divus, of, the, roman, state, ancient, sources, on, trajan, s, personality, and, accomplishments, are, unanimously, positive, pliny, the, younger, for, example, celebrates, trajan, in, his, panegyric, as, a, wise, and, just, emperor, and, a, moral, man, cassius, dio, added, that, he, always, remained, dignified, and, fair, a, third, century, emperor, decius, even, received, from, the, senate, the, name, trajan, as, a, decoration, after, the, setbacks, of, the, third, century, trajan, together, with, augustus, became, in, the, later, roman, empire, the, paragon, of, the, most, positive, traits, of, the, imperial, order, many, emperors, after, trajan, would, when, they, were, sworn, into, office, be, wished, felicior, augusto, melior, traiano, may, you, be, more, fortunate, than, augustus, and, better, than, trajan, the, fourth, century, emperor, constantine, i, is, credited, with, calling, him, a, plant, upon, every, wall, for, the, many, buildings, bearing, inscriptions, with, his, name, all, roman, emperors, until, trajan, except, nero, who, occasionally, wore, sideburns, were, depicted, clean, shaven, according, to, the, fashion, introduced, among, the, romans, by, scipio, africanus, 236, 183, bc, this, imperial, fashion, was, changed, by, trajan, s, successor, hadrian, who, made, beards, fashionable, for, emperors, during, the, middle, ages, some, theologians, such, as, thomas, aquinas, discussed, trajan, as, an, example, of, a, virtuous, pagan, in, the, divine, comedy, dante, following, this, legend, sees, the, spirit, of, trajan, in, the, heaven, of, jupiter, with, other, historical, and, mythological, persons, noted, for, their, justice, also, a, mural, of, trajan, stopping, to, provide, justice, for, a, poor, widow, is, present, in, the, first, terrace,

trajan, on, the, ceiling, of, the, banquet, hall, of, the, royal, palace, of, madrid, considered, among, the, best, works, of, this, artist, it, was, only, during, the, enlightenment, that, this, legacy, began, to, be, contested, when, edward, gibbon, expressed, doubts, about, the, militarized, character, of, trajan, s, reign, in, contrast, to, the, moderate, practices, of, his, immediate, successors, mommsen, adopted, a, divided, stance, towards, trajan, at, some, point, of, his, posthumously, published, lectures, even, speaking, about, his, vainglory, scheinglorie, mommsen, also, speaks, of, trajan, s, insatiable, unlimited, lust, for, conquest, although, mommsen, had, no, liking, for, trajan, s, successor, hadrian, a, repellent, manner, and, a, venomous, envious, and, malicious, nature, he, admitted, that, hadrian, in, renouncing, trajan, s, conquests, was, doing, what, the, situation, clearly, required, it, was, exactly, this, military, character, of, trajan, s, reign, that, attracted, his, early, twentieth, century, biographer, the, italian, historian, roberto, paribeni, who, in, his, 1927, two, volume, biography, optimus, princeps, described, trajan, s, reign, as, the, acme, of, the, roman, principate, which, he, saw, as, italy, s, patrimony, following, in, paribeni, s, footsteps, the, german, historian, alfred, heuss, saw, in, trajan, the, accomplished, human, embodiment, of, the, imperial, title, die, ideale, verk, rperung, des, humanen, kaiserbegriffs, trajan, s, first, english, language, biography, by, julian, bennett, is, also, a, positive, one, in, that, it, assumes, that, trajan, was, an, active, policy, maker, concerned, with, the, management, of, the, empire, as, a, whole, something, his, reviewer, lendon, considers, an, anachronistic, outlook, that, sees, in, the, roman, emperor, a, kind, of, modern, administrator, during, the, 1980s, the, romanian, historian, eugen, cizek, took, a, more, nuanced, view, as, he, described, the, changes, in, the, personal, ideology, of, trajan, s, reign, stressing, the, fact, that, it, became, ever, more, autocratic, and, militarized, especially, after, 112, and, towards, the, parthian, war, as, only, an, universal, monarch, a, kosmocrator, could, dictate, his, law, to, the, east, the, biography, by, the, german, historian, karl, strobel, stresses, the, continuity, between, domitian, s, and, trajan, s, reigns, saying, that, trajan, s, rule, followed, the, same, autocratic, and, sacred, character, as, domitian, s, culminating, in, a, failed, parthian, adventure, intended, as, the, crown, of, his, personal, achievement, it, is, in, modern, french, historiography, that, trajan, s, reputation, becomes, most, markedly, deflated, paul, petit, writes, about, trajan, s, portraits, as, a, lowbrow, boor, with, a, taste, for, booze, and, boys, for, paul, veyne, what, is, to, be, retained, from, trajan, s, stylish, qualities, was, that, he, was, the, last, roman, emperor, to, think, of, the, empire, as, a, purely, italian, and, rome, centred, hegemony, of, conquest, in, contrast, his, successor, hadrian, would, stress, the, notion, of, the, empire, as, ecumenical, and, of, the, emperor, as, universal, benefactor, and, not, kosmocrator, in, romania, trajan, romanian, traian, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, romanian, nation, and, a, historical, figure, of, great, importance, to, the, romanian, people, and, culture, this, is, due, to, his, orchestration, of, the, dacian, wars, that, led, to, the, foundation, of, the, daco, roman, culture, and, the, latin, based, romanian, language, the, creation, of, roman, dacia, is, therefore, seen, in, the, country, as, the, ethnogenesis, of, the, romanian, nation, in, the, jewish, homiletical, works, such, as, esther, rabbah, trajan, is, described, with, the, epitaph, may, his, bones, be, crushed, hebrew, romanized, sh, hik, atzamot, the, same, epitaph, is, also, used, for, hadrian, except, where, otherwise, noted, the, notes, below, indicate, that, an, individual, s, parentage, is, as, shown, in, the, above, family, tree
