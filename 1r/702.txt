from, rounding, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1488, having, explored, as, far, as, the, fish, river, rio, do, infante, in, modern, day, south, africa, and, having, verified, that, the, unknown, coast, stretched, away, to, the, northeast, an, explorer, was, needed, who, could, prove, the, link, between, the, findings, of, dias, and, those, of, da, covilh, and, de, paiva, and, connect, these, separate, segments, into, a, potentially, lucrative, trade, route, across, the, indian, ocean, on, 8, july, 1497, vasco, da, gama, led, a, fleet, of, four, ships, with, a, crew, of, 170, men, from,

coast, of, present, day, sierra, leone, da, gama, took, a, course, south, into, the, open, ocean, crossing, the, equator, and, seeking, the, south, atlantic, westerlies, that, bartolomeu, dias, had, discovered, in, 1487, this, course, proved, successful, and, on, 4, november, 1497, the, expedition, made, landfall, on, the, african, coast, for, over, three, months, the, ships, had, sailed, more, than, 10, 000, kilometres, 6, 000, mi, of, open, ocean, by, far, the, longest, journey, without, landfall, made, by, that, time, by, 16, december, the, fleet, had, passed, the, great, fish, river, eastern, cape, south, africa, where, dias, had, anchored, and, sailed, into, waters, previously, unknown, to, europeans, with, christmas, pending, da, gama, and, his, crew, gave, the, coast, they, were, passing, the, name, natal, which, carried, the, connotation, of, birth, of, christ, in, portuguese, vasco, da, gama, spent, 2, to, 29, march, 1498, in, the, vicinity, of, mozambique, island,

christians, da, gama, impersonated, a, muslim, and, gained, audience, with, the, sultan, of, mozambique, with, the, paltry, trade, goods, he, had, to, offer, the, explorer, was, unable, to, provide, a, suitable, gift, to, the, ruler, soon, the, local, populace, became, suspicious, of, da, gama, and, his, men, forced, by, a, hostile, crowd, to, flee, mozambique, da, gama, departed, the, harbor, firing, his, cannons, into, the, city, in, retaliation, in, the, vicinity, of, modern, kenya, the, expedition, resorted, to, piracy, looting, arab, merchant, ships, that, were, generally, unarmed, trading, vessels, without, heavy, cannons, the, portuguese, became, the, first, known, europeans, to, visit, the, port, of, mombasa, from, 7, to, 13, april, 1498, but, were, met, with, hostility, and, soon, departed, vasco, da, gama, continued, north, arriving, on, 14, april, 1498, at, the, friendlier, port, of, malindi, whose, leaders, were, in, conflict, with, those, of, mombasa, there, da, gama, and, his, crew, contracted, the, services, of, a, pilot, who, used, his, knowledge, of, the, monsoon, winds, to, guide, the, expedition, the, rest, of, the, way, to, calicut, located, on, the, southwest, coast, of, india, sources, differ, over, the, identity, of, the, pilot, calling, him, variously, a, christian, a, muslim, or, a, gujarati, hindu, one, traditional, story, describes, the, pilot, as, the, famous, arab, navigator, ibn, majid, but, other, contemporaneous, accounts, place, majid, elsewhere, and, he, could, not, have, been, near, the, vicinity, at, the, time, none, of, the, portuguese, historians, of, the, time, mentions, ibn, majid, vasco, da, gama, left, malindi, for, india, on, 24, april, 1498, the, fleet, arrived, in, kappadu, near, calicut, on, the, malabar, coast, present, day, kerala, state, of, india, on, 20, may, 1498, the, king, of, calicut, the, samudiri, zamorin, who, was, at, that, time, staying, in, his, second, capital, at, ponnani, returned, to, calicut, on, hearing, the, news, of, the, foreign, fleet, s, arrival, the, navigator, was, received, with, traditional, hospitality, including, a, grand, procession, of, at, least, 3, 000, armed, nairs, but, an, interview, with, the, zamorin, failed, to, produce, any, concrete, results, when, local, authorities, asked, da, gama, s, fleet, what, brought, you, hither, they, replied, that, they, had, come, in, search, of, christians, and, spices, the, presents, that, da, gama, sent, to, the, zamorin, as, gifts, from, dom, manuel, four, cloaks, of, scarlet, cloth, six, hats, four, branches, of, corals, twelve, almasares, a, box, with, seven, brass, vessels, a, chest, of, sugar, two, barrels, of, oil, and, a, cask, of, honey, were, trivial, and, failed, to, impress, while, the, zamorin, s, officials, wondered, at, why, there, was, no, gold, or, silver, the, muslim, merchants, who, considered, da, gama, their, rival, suggested, that, the, latter, was, only, an, ordinary, pirate, and, not, a, royal, ambassador, vasco, da, gama, s, request, for, permission, to, leave, a, factor, behind, him, in, charge, of, the, merchandise, he, could, not, sell, was, turned, down, by, the, king, who, insisted, that, da, gama, pay, customs, duty, preferably, in, gold, like, any, other, trader, which, strained, the, relation, between, the, two, annoyed, by, this, da, gama, carried, a, few, nairs, and, sixteen, fishermen, mukkuva, off, with, him, by, force, vasco, da, gama, left, calicut, on, 29, august, 1498, eager, to, set, sail, for, home, he, ignored, the, local, knowledge, of, monsoon, wind, patterns, that, were, still, blowing, onshore, the, fleet, initially, inched, north, along, the, indian, coast, and, then, anchored, in, at, anjediva, island, for, a, spell, they, finally, struck, out, for, their, indian, ocean, crossing, on, 3, october, 1498, but, with, the, winter, monsoon, yet, to, set, in, it, was, a, harrowing, journey, on, the, outgoing, journey, sailing, with, the, summer, monsoon, wind, da, gama, s, fleet, crossed, the, indian, ocean, in, only, 23, days, now, on, the, return, trip, sailing, against, the, wind, it, took, more, than, 90, days, da, gama, saw, land, again, only, on, 2, january, 1499, passing, before, the, coastal, somali, city, of, mogadishu, then, under, the, influence, of, the, ajuran, empire, in, the, horn, of, africa, the, fleet, did, not, make, a, stop, but, passing, before, mogadishu, the, anonymous, diarist, of, the, expedition, noted, that, it, was, a, large, city, with, houses, of, four, or, five, storeys, high, and, big, palaces, in, its, center, and, many, mosques, with, cylindrical, minarets, da, gama, s, fleet, finally, arrived, in, malindi, on, 7, january, 1499, in, a, terrible, state, approximately, half, of, the, crew, had, died, during, the, crossing, and, many, of, the, rest, were, afflicted, with, scurvy, not, having, enough, crewmen, left, standing, to, manage, three, ships, da, gama, ordered, the, s, o, rafael, scuttled, off, the, east, african, coast, and, the, crew, re, distributed, to, the, remaining, two, ships, the, s, o, gabriel, and, the, berrio, while, there, he, was, also, granted, permission, by, the, sultan, to, set, up, a, padr, o, a, stone, pillar, the, vasco, da, gama, pillar, as, it, is, still, known, locally, seems, to, be, the, only, one, of, the, many, padr, es, set, up, by, da, gama, to, survive, to, the, present, day, after, leaving, malindi, the, sailing, was, smoother, by, early, march, the, fleet, had, arrived, in, mossel, bay, and, crossed, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, the, opposite, direction, on, 20, march, reaching, the, western, coast, of, africa, by, 25, april, the, diary, record, of, the, expedition, ends, abruptly, here, reconstructing, from, other, sources, it, seems, they, continued, to, cape, verde, where, nicolau, coelho, s, berrio, separated, from, vasco, da, gama, s, s, o, gabriel, and, sailed, on, by, itself, the, berrio, arrived, in, lisbon, on, 10, july, 1499, and, nicolau, coelho, personally, delivered, the, news, to, king, manuel, i, and, the, royal, court, then, assembled, in, sintra, in, the, meantime, back, in, cape, verde, da, gama, s, brother, paulo, da, gama, had, fallen, grievously, ill, da, gama, elected, to, stay, by, his, side, on, santiago, island, and, handed, the, s, o, gabriel, over, to, his, clerk, jo, o, de, s, to, take, home, the, s, o, gabriel, under, s, arrived, in, lisbon, sometime, in, late, july, or, early, august, da, gama, and, his, sickly, brother, eventually, hitched, a, ride, with, a, guinea, caravel, returning, to, portugal, but, paulo, da, gama, died, en, route, da, gama, disembarked, at, the, azores, to, bury, his, brother, at, the, monastery, of, s, o, francisco, in, angra, do, heroismo, and, lingered, there, for, a, little, while, in, mourning, he, eventually, took, passage, on, an, azorean, caravel, and, finally, arrived, in, lisbon, on, 29, august, 1499, according, to, barros, or, early, september, 8th, or, 18th, according, to, other, sources, despite, his, melancholic, mood, da, gama, was, given, a, hero, s, welcome, and, showered, with, honors, including, a, triumphal, procession, and, public, festivities, king, manuel, wrote, two, letters, in, which, he, described, da, gama, s, first, voyage, in, july, and, august, 1499, soon, after, the, return, of, the, ships, girolamo, sernigi, also, wrote, three, letters, describing, da, gama, s, first, voyage, soon, after, the, return, of, the, expedition, the, expedition, had, exacted, a, large, cost, two, ships, and, over, half, the, men, had, been, lost, it, had, also, failed, in, its, principal, mission, of, securing, a, commercial, treaty, with, calicut, nonetheless, the, small, quantities, of, spices, and, other, trade, goods, brought, back, on, the, remaining, two, ships, demonstrated, the, potential, of, great, profit, for, future, trade, vasco, da, gama, was, justly, celebrated, for, opening, a, direct, sea, route, to, asia, his, path, would, be, followed, up, thereafter, by, yearly, portuguese, india, armadas, the, spice, trade, would, prove, to, be, a, major, asset, to, the, portuguese, royal, treasury, and, other, consequences, soon, followed, for, example, da, gama, s, voyage, had, made, it, clear, that, the, east, coast, of, africa, the, contra, costa, was, essential, to, portuguese, interests, its, ports, provided, fresh, water, provisions, timber, and, harbors, for, repairs, and, served, as, a, refuge, where, ships, could, wait, out, unfavorable, weather, one, significant, result, was, the, colonization, of, mozambique, by, the, portuguese, crown, in, december, 1499, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, rewarded, vasco, da, gama, with, the, town, of, sines, as, a, hereditary, fief, the, town, his, father, est, v, o, had, once, held, as, a, comenda, this, turned, out, to, be, a, complicated, affair, for, sines, still, belonged, to, the, order, of, santiago, the, master, of, the, order, jorge, de, lencastre, might, have, endorsed, the, reward, after, all, da, gama, was, a, santiago, knight, one, of, their, own, and, a, close, associate, of, lencastre, himself, but, the, fact, that, sines, was, awarded, by, the, king, provoked, lencastre, to, refuse, out, of, principle, lest, it, encourage, the, king, to, make, other, donations, of, the, order, s, properties, da, gama, would, spend, the, next, few, years, attempting, to, take, hold, of, sines, an, effort, that, would, estrange, him, from, lencastre, and, eventually, prompt, da, gama, to, abandon, his, beloved, order, of, santiago, switching, over, to, the, rival, order, of, christ, in, 1507, in, the, meantime, da, gama, made, do, with, a, substantial, hereditary, royal, pension, of, 300, 000, reis, he, was, awarded, the, noble, title, of, dom, lord, in, perpetuity, for, himself, his, siblings, and, their, descendants, on, 30, january, 1502, da,

overwrought, title, reminiscent, of, the, ornate, castilian, title, borne, by, christopher, columbus, another, royal, letter, dated, october, 1501, gave, da, gama, the, personal, right, to, intervene, and, exercise, a, determining, role, on, any, future, india, bound, fleet, around, 1501, vasco, da, gama, married, catarina, de, ata, de, daughter, of, lvaro, de, ata, de, the, alcaide, m, r, of,

to, his, rebellious, vassal, the, raja, of, cochin, urging, cooperation, and, obedience, to, counter, the, portuguese, threat, the, ruler, of, cochin, forwarded, this, message, to, gama, which, reinforced, his, opinion, of, the, indians, as, duplicitous, after, da, gama, s, demand, for, the, expulsion, of, muslims, from, calicut, the, zamorin, sent, the, high, priest, talappana, namboothiri, the, very, same, person, who, conducted, da, gama, to, the, zamorin, s, chamber, during, his, much, celebrated, first, visit, to, calicut, in, may, 1498, for, talks, da, gama, called, him, a, spy, ordered, the, priest, s, lips, and, ears, to, be, cut, off, and, after, sewing, a, pair, of, dog, s, ears, to, his, head, sent, him, away, the, portuguese, fleet, then, bombarded, the, unfortified, city, for, nearly, two, days, from, the, sea, severely, damaging, it, he, also, captured, several, rice, vessels, and, cut, off, the, crew, s, hands, ears, and, noses, dispatching, them, with, a, note, to, the, zamorin, in, which, gama, declared, that, he, would, be, open, to, friendly, relations, once, the, zamorin, had, paid, for, the, items, plundered, from, the, feitoria, as, well, as, the, gunpowder, and, cannonballs, the, violent, treatment, meted, out, by, da, gama, quickly, brought, trade, along, the, malabar, coast, of, india, upon, which, calicut, depended, to, a, standstill, the, zamorin, ventured, to, dispatch, a, fleet, of, strong, warships, to, challenge, da, gama, s, armada, but, which, gama, managed, to, defeat, in, a, naval, battle, before, calicut, harbor, da, gama, loaded, up, with, spices, at, cochin, and, cannanore, small, nearby, kingdoms, at, war, with, the, zamorin, whose, alliances, had, been, secured, by, prior, portuguese, fleets, the, 4th, armada, left, india, in, early, 1503, da, gama, left, behind, a, small, squadron, of, caravels, under, the, command, of, his, uncle, vicente, sodr, to, patrol, the, indian, coast, to, continue, harassing, calicut, shipping, and, to, protect, the, portuguese, factories, at, cochin, and, cannanore, from, the, zamorin, s, inevitable, reprisals, vasco, da, gama, arrived, back, in, portugal, in, september, 1503, effectively, having, failed, in, his, mission, to, bring, the, zamorin, to, submission, this, failure, and, the, subsequent, more, galling, failure, of, his, uncle, vicente, sodr, to, protect, the, portuguese, factory, in, cochin, probably, counted, against, any, further, rewards, when, the, portuguese, king, manuel, i, decided, to, appoint, the, first, governor, and, viceroy, of, portuguese, india, in, 1505, da, gama, was, conspicuously, overlooked, and, the, post, given, to, francisco, de, almeida, for, the, next, two, decades, vasco, da, gama, lived, out, a, quiet, life, unwelcome, in, the, royal, court, and, sidelined, from, indian, affairs, his, attempts, to, return, to, the, favor, of, manuel, i, including, switching, over, to, the, order, of, christ, in, 1507, yielded, little, almeida, the, larger, than, life, afonso, de, albuquerque, and, later, on, albergaria, and, sequeira, were, the, king, s, preferred, point, men, for, india, after, ferdinand, magellan, defected, to, the, crown, of, castile, in, 1518, vasco, da, gama, threatened, to, do, the, same, prompting, the, king, to, undertake, steps, to, retain, him, in, portugal, and, avoid, the, embarrassment, of, losing, his, own, admiral, of, the, indies, to, spain, in, 1519, after, years, of, ignoring, his, petitions, king, manuel, i, finally, hurried, to, give, vasco, da, gama, a, feudal, title, appointing, him, the, first, count, of, vidigueira, a, title, created, by, a, royal, decree, issued, in, vora, on, 29, december, after, a, complicated, agreement, with, dom, jaime, duke, of, braganza, who, ceded, him, on, payment, the, towns, of, vidigueira, and, vila, dos, frades, the, decree, granted, vasco, da, gama, and, his, heirs, all, the, revenues, and, privileges, related, thus, promoting, da, gama, from, a, petty, noble, to, one, of, the, relatively, few, titled, nobles, in, portugal, after, the, death, of, king, manuel, i, in, late, 1521, his, son, and, successor, king, john, iii, of, portugal, set, about, reviewing, the, portuguese, government, overseas, turning, away, from, the, old, albuquerque, clique, now, represented, by, diogo, lopes, de, sequeira, john, iii, looked, for, a, fresh, start, vasco, da, gama, re, emerged, from, his, political, wilderness, as, an, important, adviser, to, the, new, king, s, appointments, and, strategy, seeing, the, new, spanish, threat, to, the, maluku, islands, as, the, priority, vasco, da, gama, advised, against, the, obsession, with, arabia, that, had, pervaded, much, of, the, manueline, period, and, continued, to, be, the, dominant, concern, of, duarte, de, menezes, then, governor, of, portuguese, india, menezes, also, turned, out, to, be, incompetent, and, corrupt, subject, to, numerous, complaints, as, a, result, john, iii, decided, to, appoint, vasco, da, gama, himself, to, replace, menezes, confident, that, the, magic, of, his, name, and, memory, of, his, deeds, might, better, impress, his, authority, on, portuguese, india, and, manage, the, transition, to, a, new, government, and, new, strategy, by, his, appointment, letter, of, february, 1524, john, iii, granted, vasco, da, gama, the, privileged, title, of, viceroy, being, only, the, second, portuguese, governor, to, enjoy, that, title, the, first, was, francisco, de, almeida, in, 1505, his, second, son, est, v, o, da, gama, was, simultaneously, appointed, capit, o, mor, do, mar, da, ndia, captain, major, of, the, indian, sea, commander, of, the, indian, ocean, naval, patrol, fleet, to, replace, duarte, s, brother, lu, s, de, menezes, as, a, final, condition, gama, secured, from, john, iii, of, portugal, the, commitment, to, appoint, all, his, sons, successively, as, portuguese, captains, of, malacca, setting, out, in, april, 1524, with, a, fleet, of, fourteen, ships, vasco, da, gama, took, as, his, flagship, the, famous, large, carrack, santa, catarina, do, monte, sinai, on, her, last, journey, to, india, along, with, two, of, his, sons, est, v, o, and, paulo, after, a, troubled, journey, in, which, four, or, five, of, the, ships, were, lost, en, route, he, arrived, in, india, in, september, early, on, the, morning, of, september, 8, as, the, ships, laid, becalmed, near, dabul, the, sea, began, to, boil, and, the, vessels, pitched, and, rocked, violently, for, about, an, hour, as, the, result, of, an, submarine, earthquake, the, portuguese, crews, were, frightened, and, one, death, occurred, as, a, sailor, jumped, overboard, in, panic, and, drowned, gama, capitalized, on, the, situation, and, so, as, to, reassure, his, men, cried, out, friends, rejoice, and, be, happy, for, even, sea, trembles, before, us, vasco, da, gama, immediately, invoked, his, high, viceregal, powers, to, impose, a, new, order, in, portuguese, india, replacing, all, the, old, officials, with, his, own, appointments, but, da, gama, contracted, malaria, not, long, after, arriving, and, died, in, the, city, of, cochin, on, christmas, eve, in, 1524, three, months, after, his, arrival, as, per, royal, instructions, da, gama, was, succeeded, as, governor, of, india, by, one, of, the, captains, who, had, come, with, him, henrique, de, menezes, no, relation, to, duarte, da, gama, s, sons, est, v, o, and, paulo, immediately, lost, their, posts, and, joined, the, returning, fleet, of, early, 1525, along, with, the, dismissed, duarte, de, menezes, and, lu, s, de, menezes, vasco, da, gama, s, body, was, first, buried, at, st, francis, church, at, fort, kochi, in, the, city, of, kochi, but, his, remains, were,

construction, funded, by, a, tax, on, the, profits, of, the, yearly, portuguese, india, armadas, in, 1880, what, were, believed, to, be, da, gama, s, remains, and, those, of, the, poet, lu, s, de, cam, es, who, celebrated, da, gama, s, first, voyage, in, his, 1572, epic, poem, os, lus, adas, were, moved, to, new, carved, tombs, in, the, nave, of, the, monastery, s, church, only, a, few, meters, away, from, the, tombs, of, the, kings, manuel, i, and, john, iii, whom, da, gama, had, served, however, by, 1884, teixeira, de, arag, o, one, of, the, advocates, for, the, transfer, of, da, gama, s, remains, to, the, monastery, discovered, documents, suggesting, that, the, wrong, remains, had, been, exhumed, from, vidigueira, apparently, da, gama, s, gravestone, had, been, exchanged, with, that, of, his, great, grandson, francisco, da, gama, whose, tomb, lay, opposite, his, likely, during, restoration, works, in, 1841, additionally, it, was, found, that, the, casket, moved, in, 1880, contained, the, bones, of, more, than, one, person, whereas, the, other, tomb, contained, only, one, skeleton, it, was, not, until, may, 1898, during, the, celebrations, of, the, fourth, centenary,

the, fact, of, the, first, voyage, itself, it, was, his, astute, mix, of, politics, and, war, on, the, other, side, of, the, world, that, placed, portugal, in, a, prominent, position, in, indian, ocean, trade, following, da, gama, s, initial, voyage, the, portuguese, crown, realized, that, securing, outposts, on, the, eastern, coast, of, africa, would, prove, vital, to, maintaining, national,
