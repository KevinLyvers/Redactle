of, historiography, theorized, that, yu, was, not, a, person, in, the, earliest, legends, but, rather, a, god, or, mythical, beast, who, was, connected, with, water, and, possibly, with, the, mythical, dragon, kings, and, their, control, over, water, according, to, this, theory, yu, was, represented, on, ceremonial, bronzes, by, the, early, xia, people, and, by, the, beginning, of, the, zhou, dynasty, the, legendary, figure, had, morphed, into, the, first, man, who, could, control, water, and, it, was, only, during, the, zhou, dynasty, that, the, legendary, figures, that, now, precede, yu, were, added, to, the, orthodox, legendary, lineage, according, to, the, chinese, legend, yu, the, great, was, a, man, god, archaeological, evidence, of, a, large, outburst, flood, at, jishi, gorge, on, the, yellow, river, has, been, dated, c, 1920, bc, this, coincides, with, new, cultures, all, along, the, yellow, river, the, water, control, problems, after, the, initial, flooding, could, plausibly, have, lasted, for, some, twenty, years, wu, and, coauthors, suggest, that, this, supports, the, idea, that, the, stories, of, yu, the, great, may, have, originated, from, a, historical, person, yu, was, long, regarded, as, an, ideal, ruler, and, kind, of, philosopher, king, by, the, ancient, chinese, beichuan, wenchuan, and, dujiangyan, in, sichuan, have, all, made, claims, to, be, his, birthplace, owing, to, his, involvement, in, china, s, mythical, great, flood, yu, also, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, water, deity, in, taoism, and, chinese, folk, religion, he, is, the, head, of, the, five, kings, of, the, water, immortals, honored, in, shrines, in, mazu, temples, as, protectors, of, ships, in, transit, his, personal, name, is, written, identically, to, a,
