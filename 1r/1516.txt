nikolay, baskakov, and, alexandra, superanskaya, who, pointed, out, that, the, word, suvorov, more, likely, comes, from, the, ancient, russian, male, name, suvor, based, on, the, adjective, suvory, an, equivalent, of, surovy, which, means, severe, in, russian, baskakov, also, pointed, to, the, fact, that, the, suvorovs, family, coat, of, arms, lacks, any, swedish, symbols, implying, its, russian, origins, among, the, first, of, those, who, pointed, to, the, russian, origin, of, the, name, were, empress, catherine, ii, who, noted, in, a, letter, to, johann, von, zimmerman, in, 1790,

however, when, alexander, was, young, general, gannibal, asked, to, speak, to, the, child, and, was, so, impressed, with, the, boy, that, he, persuaded, the, father, to, allow, him, to, pursue, the,

independent, and, were, not, directly, subordinate, to, suvorov, suvorov, supposedly, tried, to, stop, the, massacre, and, even, went, to, the, extent, of, ordering, the, destruction, of, the, bridge, to, warsaw, over, the, vistula, river, with, the, purpose, of, preventing, the, spread, of, violence, to, warsaw, from, its, suburb, other, historians, dispute, this, but, most, sources, make, no,

such, was, that, of, praga, according, to, petrushevsky, it, is, homogeneous, with, the, izmailian, at, its, core, and, identical, to, it, in, many, basic, details, both, show, a, remarkable, military, calculation, which, includes, not, only, figures, but, knowledge, of, the, enemy, s, character, properties, and, general, strength, a, correct, estimation, of, their, own, resources, moral, and, material, and, a, choice, of, means, based, on, these, data, but, even, more, than, the, plan, the, storming, programme, what, is, striking, is, its, execution, in, which, some, features, of, the, plan, turned, out, to, be, additional, steps, to, the, russian, victory, only, troops, who, are, perfectly, trained, and, between, whom, and, their, leader, there, is, complete, harmony, can, act, in, this, way, despite, early, successes, on, a, battlefield, the, organizer, of, the, uprising, tadeusz, ko, ciuszko, was, captured, by, the, don, cossack, general, fyodor, p, denisov, at, the,

particularly, in, the, battle, of, kozlud, a, 1774, suvorov, laid, the, foundations, of, his, reputation, there, during, the, same, conflict, the, imperial, russian, navy, triumphed, over, the, ottoman, navy, at, the, battle, of, cheshme, and, peter, pyotr, rumyantsev, likewise, one, of, the, most, capable, russian, commanders, of, the, era, as, per, statistician, gaston, bodart, and,

suvorov, but, at, the, same, time, a, vexation, stirred, up, in, him, from, the, fact, that, he, had, not, participated, there, while, in, poland, suvorov, s, displeasure, inflated, by, his, self, love, and, unsatisfied, thirst, for, activity, was, fed, by, news, from, the, turkish, theatre, of, war, there, was, or, he, thought, there, was, what, he, wanted, that, comfort, about, which, he, wrote, to, yakov, bulgakov, in, january, 1771, especially, strong, was, to, ignite, in, suvorov, is, the, desire, to, go, to, the, main, army, after, its, glorious, deeds, of, 1770, it, was, then, that, he, had, already, started, pushing, for, a, transfer, from, poland, to, turkey, his, later, earned, victories, against, the, ottomans, bolstered, the, morale, of, his, soldiers, who, were, usually, outnumbered, such, as, the, stormings, of, turtukaya, on, 21, may, 28, june, 1773, and, the, repelling, of, the, assault, on, hirsovo, fortress, with, a, subsequent, counterattack, on, 14,

stronghold, and, following, its, capture, even, before, sunrise, suvorov, wrote, in, pencil, on, a, small, piece, of, paper, and, sent, to, lieutenant, general, count, ivan, saltykov, in, whose,

uncanny, and, he, also, proved, a, self, willed, subordinate, who, acted, upon, his, own, initiative, rumyantsev, s, putting, suvorov, on, trial, for, his, arbitrary, reconnaissance, of, turtukaya, belongs, to, the, realm, of, pure, fiction, rumyantsev, was, not, dissatisfied, with, suvorov, but, with, ivan, saltykov, there, was, inactivity, in, wallachia, after, suvorov, s, initial, capture, of, turtukaya, saltykov, did, not, take, advantage, of, the, successful, turtukaya, engagement, despite, the, insistence, of, rumyantsev, and, ottoman, communications, on, the, danube, became,

mention, of, alexander, vasilyevich, in, one, decent, but, rather, unpleasant, letter, to, saltykov, he, amuses, himself, about, the, second, turtukaya, victory, of, suvorov, and, the, inaction, of, saltykov, himself, plus, a, little, earlier, several, reconnaissances, had, been, made, from, saltykov, s, division, and, one, of, them, very, unsuccessful, colonel, prince, repnin, was, taken,

1787, and, saved, only, thanks, to, the, intervention, of, the, grenadier, stepan, novikov, novikov, heard, the, call, of, his, chief, threw, himself, at, the, turks, he, stabbed, one, shot, another, and, turned, to, the, third, but, that, one, fled, and, with, him, the, rest, the, retreating, russian, grenadiers, noticed, suvorov, and, shouted, brothers, the, general, stayed, in, front, rushed, again, upon, the, ottomans, the, fight, resumed, and, the, bewildered, turkish, soldiers, began, again, to, rapidly, lose, one, trench, after, another, suvorov, suffered, greatly, from, grievous, wounds, and, huge, loss, of, blood, although, he, kept, on, his, feet, he, often, fainted, and, this, went, on, for, a, month, suvorov, was, also, soon, involved, in, the, costly, siege, of, ochakov, zi, energetic, and, courageous, as, usual, alexander, suvorov, proposed, to, take, the, fortress, by, storm, but, potemkin, was, cautious, that, s, not, how, we, beat, the, poles, and, the, turks, suvorov, said, in, a, close, group, of, people, one, look, will, not, take, the, fortress, if, you, had, listened, to, me, ochakov, would, have, been, in, our, hands, long, ago, the, siege, that, took, place, was, supported, by, a, blockade, of, the, black, sea, flotilla, of, charles, henri, de, nassau, siegen, under, john, paul, jones, a, renowned, fighter, for, american, independence, after, a, fierce, naval, combat, the, russian, rowing, vessels, surrounded, the, flagship, and, took, it, only, kapudan, derya, hasan, pasha, managed, to, escape, however, when, great, damage, was, done, to, the, ottoman, fortress, plus, fleet, as, if, inviting, the, besiegers, to, storm, potemkin, still, continued, the, siege, which, rumyantsev, wryly, called, the, siege, of, troy, and, suvorov, described, in, couplet, that, he, was, sitting, on, a, stone, so, cold, watching, ochakov, as, of, old, the, mortality, rate, was, extreme, from, one, cold, 30, 40, people, a, day, the, soldiers, were, stiff, in, their, dugouts, suffering, terrible, want, of, essentials, and, so, were, the, horses, during, potemkin, s, visit, to, the, camp, the, soldiers, took, the, courage, to, personally, ask, him, to, storm, but, this, did, not, work, at, last, there, was, a, deafening, murmur, among, the, whole, army, only, having, reached, such, a, hopeless, situation, potemkin, decided, to, storm, setting, it, for, 17, december, in, which, suvorov, did, not, participate, due, to, a, bullet, wound, that, penetrated, his, neck, and, stopped, at, the, back, of, his, head, this, happened, during, a, successful, ottoman, sortie, from, the, fortress, in, 1789, after, the, joint, russian, and, habsburg, victorious, battle, of, foc, ani, he, and, the, talented, austro, bavarian, general, josias, of, coburg, fought, most, decisive, victories, in, their, career, first, at, the, battle, of, rymnik, where, despite, the, vast, inferiority, in, numbers, a, russian, austrian, force, of, 25, 000, against, 100, 000, turks, suvorov, persuaded, the, austrian, commander, to, attack, with, the, bold, flanking, maneuver, of, suvorov, and, the, resilience, of, the, austrians, together, they, routed, the, ottoman, army, within, a, few, hours, losing, only, 500, men, in, the, process, suvorov, earned, the, nickname, general, forward, in, the, ranks, of, the, austrian, corps, for, the, latter, victory, the, word, combination, came, to, his, attention, and, gave, him, sincere, pleasure, as, he, later, recalled, this, martial, assessment, of, his, person, smugly, grinning, suvorov, s, 11th, fanagoriysky, grenadier, regiment, was, formed, from, soldiers, who, took, part, at, rymnik, catherine, the, great, in, turn, made, suvorov, a, count, with, the, name, rymniksky, or, rimniksky, as, a, victory, title, in, addition, to, his, own, name, and, the, emperor, joseph, ii, made, him, a, count, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, second, one, came, at, the, storming, of, izmail, in, bessarabia, on, 22, december, 1790, on, 20, december, suvorov, convened, a, military, council, petrushevsky, writes, as, follows, suvorov, had, nothing, to, consult, about, but, by, doing, so, he, acted, on, the, basis, of, the, law, and, used, this, means, to, communicate, his, decision, to, others, to, make, his, view, their, view, his, conviction, their, conviction, petrushevsky, further, observes, this, is, very, difficult, for, ordinary, commanders, who, do, not, tower, over, their, subordinates, in, anything, other, than, their, position, but, easy, for, such, as, suvorov, there, is, no, need, for, ranting, or, intricately, woven, evidence, it, is, the, winning, authority, that, persuades, the, unbending, will, that, fascinates, suvorov, spoke, a, little, in, council, and, nevertheless, brought, everyone, into, raptures, he, enthralled, the, very, people, who, a, few, days, ago, considered, the, same, assault, unrealisable, the, youngest, of, those, present, brigadier, platov, said, the, word, assault, and, the, decision, to, assault, was, taken, by, all, 13, persons, without, exception, the, council, determined, approaching, izmail, according, to, the, disposition, to, storm, it, without, delay, in, order, to, give, the, enemy, no, time, for, further, strengthening, and, therefore, there, is, no, need, for, reference, to, his, lordship, the, commander, in, chief, serasker, s, request, is, to, be, refused, the, siege, must, not, be, turned, into, a, blockade, retreat, is, reprehensible, to, her, imperial, majesty, s, victorious, troops, by, virtue, of, chapter, fourteen, of, the, military, regulations, turkish, forces, inside, the, fortress, had, the, orders, to, stand, their, ground, to, the, end, and, haughtily, declined, the, russian, ultimatum, despite, the, fact, that, mehmed, pasha, was, a, resolute, and, firm, commander, and, inflicted, serious, losses, on, the, russians, his, army, was, destroyed, their, defeat, was, seen, as, a, major, catastrophe, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, in, russian, military, history, there, has, never, been, a, similar, instantaneous, storming, of, a, fortress, in, terms, of, numbers, and, casualties, as, that, of, izmail, much, less, without, a, proper, siege, an, unofficial, russian, national, anthem, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, grom, pobedy, razdavaysya, let, the, thunder, of, victory, rumble, by, gavrila, derzhavin, and, j, zef, koz, owski, immortalized, suvorov, s, victory, and, 24, december, is, today, commemorated, as, a, day, of, military, honour, in, russia, in, this, war, fyodor, ushakov, also, won, many, famous, naval, victories, as, in, the, battle, of, tendra, which, deprived, the, ottomans, of, izmail, s, support, from, the, danube, suvorov, announced, the, capture, of, ismail, in, 1791, to, the, empress, catherine, in, a, doggerel, couplet, the, war, ended, with, the, treaty, of, jassy, from, 1774, to, 1797, suvorov, stayed, and, served, in, russia, itself, that, is, in, transvolga, or, zavolzhye, in, astrakhan, kremenchug, the, russian, capital, saint, petersburg, in, crimea, or, more, accurately, little, tartary, kuban, which, is, in, the, north, caucasus, and, kherson, in, the, recently, former, poland, tulchin, kobrin, and, in, the, vyborg, governorate, on, the, border, with, swedish, finland, in, 1774, suvorov, was, dispatched, to, suppress, pugachev, s, rebellion, whose, leader, yemelyan, pugachev, claimed, to, be, the, assassinated, tsar, peter, iii, count, pyotr, panin, appointed, for, operations, against, pugachev, asked, to, appoint, a, general, to, assist, him, who, could, replace, him, in, case, of, illness, or, death, on, the, very, day, of, the, news, arrival, of, pugachev, s, passage, to, the, right, bank, of, the, volga, rumyantsev, sent, orders, to, send, suvorov, to, moscow, as, soon, as, possible, suvorov, who, was, in, moldavia, immediately, rushed, out, at, full, speed, met, in, moscow, with, his, wife, and, father, on, the, order, left, by, panin, in, one, caftan, and, without, luggage, raced, to, the, village, of, ukholovo, between, shatsk, and, pereyaslavl, ryazansky, he, arrived, in, ukholovo, on, september, 3, ns, just, at, the, time, when, panin, received, notice, of, alexander, vasilyevich, s, appointment, panin, gave, him, broad, powers, and, ordered, the, military, and, civil, authorities, to, execute, all, suvorov, s, orders, after, receiving, instructions, suvorov, the, same, day, set, out, on, the, road, in, the, direction, of, arzamas, and, penza, to, saratov, with, a, small, escort, of, 50, men, panin, reported, to, the, empress, on, the, rapid, performance, of, his, new, subordinate, which, promised, in, the, circumstances, of, the, time, a, lot, of, good, ahead, and, therefore, worthy, of, attention, thanking, him, for, such, zeal, and, speed, the, empress, granted, him, 2, 000, chervonets, to, equip, the, crew, reaching, saratov, suvorov, learned, that, tireless, ivan, mikhelson, who, like, a, shadow, followed, everywhere, after, pugachev, and, repeatedly, defeated, him, again, defeated, him, badly, strengthening, his, detachment, here, suvorov, hurried, to, tsaritsyn, but, a, lot, of, horses, went, to, pugachev, there, was, a, lack, of, them, and, suvorov, was, forced, to, continue, the, journey, by, water, defeated, by, mikhelson, pugachev, slipped, away, having, somehow, crossed, the, volga, with, a, small, number, of, his, loyalists, he, disappeared, into, the, vast, steppe, hasty, arrival, of, suvorov, in, tsaritsyn, drew, the, attention, of, the, empress, who, announced, her, pleasure, to, count, panin, but, suvorov, was, still, essentially, late, however, suvorov, did, not, stop, it, he, assigned, to, his, detachment, 2, squadrons, 2, cossack, sotnias, using, horses, captured, by, mikhelson, put, on, horseback, 300, infantrymen, seized, 2, light, guns, and, after, spending, less, than, a, day, on, it, all, crossed, the, volga, apparently, for, reconnaissance, on, the, rebels, he, first, moved, upriver, came, to, a, large, village, which, kept, the, pugachev, side, took, 50, oxen, and, then, seeing, that, around, the, quiet, turned, to, the, steppe, this, vast, steppe, which, stretched, for, several, hundred, km, desolate, woodless, homeless, was, a, dead, desert, where, even, without, the, enemy, s, weapons, was, threatened, with, death, suvorov, had, very, little, bread, he, ordered, to, kill, salt, and, bake, on, fire, some, of, the, taken, cattle, and, use, the, slices, of, meat, for, people, instead, of, bread, as, he, did, in, the, last, campaign, of, the, seven, years, war, thus, secured, for, some, time, suvorov, s, detachment, went, deeper, into, the, steppe, they, followed, the, sun, by, day, and, the, stars, by, night, there, were, no, roads, they, followed, the, traces, and, moved, as, fast, as, they, could, not, paying, attention, to, any, atmospheric, changes, because, there, was, no, place, to, hide, from, them, in, different, places, suvorov, was, overtaken, and, joined, by, several, detachments, who, went, before, him, from, tsaritsyn, september, 23, ns, he, came, to, the, maly, uzen, river, divided, his, squad, into, four, parts, and, went, to, the, bolshoy, uzen, in, different, directions, soon, they, stumbled, on, pugachev, s, trail, they, found, out, that, pugachev, was, here, in, the, morning, that, his, men, seeing, an, unstoppable, pursuit, lost, faith, in, the, success, of, their, cause, revolted, tied, pugachev, and, took, him, to, yaitsk, to, extradite, the, leader, to, save, themselves, and, indeed, pugachev, was, arrested, as, it, turned, out, later, at, this, time, some, 53, km, 33, mi, from, suvorov, suvorov, arrived, at, the, scene, only, in, time, to, conduct, the, first, interrogation, of, the, rebel, leader, but, suvorov, missed, the, chance, to, defeat, him, in, battle, who, had, been, betrayed, by, his, fellow, cossacks, and, was, eventually, beheaded, in, moscow, as, a, result, of, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1768, 1774, the, crimean, khanate, became, independent, of, the, ottomans, but, in, fact, became, a, russian, protectorate, 1774, to, 1783, the, russian, imposed, ahin, giray, proved, unpopular, the, kuban, nogais, remained, hostile, to, the, russian, government, from, the, end, of, january, 1777, suvorov, set, about, building, new, fortifications, at, kuban, despite, the, severe, cold, and, predator, raids, suggesting, that, the, entire, cordon, should, be, shortened, and, that, it, should, be, connected, to, the, azov, mozdok, fortified, line, there, were, only, about, 12, 000, men, under, suvorov, s, command, he, explored, the, region, more, than, 30, fortifications, were, built, and, the, order, of, service, at, the, cordon, was, changed, attacks, from, across, the, kuban, ceased, tatars, guarded, against, the, unrest, of, turkish, zakuban, emissaries, and, from, the, raids, of, predators, were, pacified, and, began, to, make, sure, that, the, russians, really, had, good, intentions, towards, them, but, the, peace, was, short, lived, however, intelligent, rumyantsev, could, not, fail, to, appreciate, the, fruitful, activities, of, suvorov, in, kuban, and, spoke, of, him, with, pleasure, and, praise, by, 1781, the, situation, in, the, crimean, khanate, especially, in, the, north, west, caucasus, had, heated, up, to, the, limit, dissatisfaction, with, the, khan, and, the, withdrawal, of, russian, troops, led, to, an, uprising, of, the, kuban, nogais, at, the, beginning, of, the, year, by, july, 1782, the, uprising, had, spread, to, crimea, in, september, october, 1782, suvorov, was, engaged, in, restoring, order, on, the, territory, of, n, w, caucasus, the, first, insurrection, was, suppressed, by, the, force, of, returning, russian, troops, directly, by, alexander, suvorov, and, anton, de, balmen, at, the, end, of, 1782, balmen, put, down, a, rebellion, on, the, crimean, peninsula, territory, in, 1783, suvorov, with, complete, surprise, for, the, rebels, crossed, the, kuban, river, and, in, the, battle, of, the, laba, on, 1, october, near, kermenchik, tract, decisively, quelled, the, second, nogai, uprising, which, in, turn, was, triggered, by, catherine, s, manifesto, declaring, crimea, taman, and, kuban, as, russian, possessions, at, the, laba, nogai, losses, amounted, to, 4, 000, on, behalf, of, empress, catherine, ii, suvorov, participated, in, an, incident, the, forced, resettlement, of, christians, from, crimea, the, possession, of, crimea, did, not, seem, secure, for, russia, at, that, time, russia, had, to, extract, all, it, could, from, crimea, and, this, was, achieved, by, resettling, christians, mainly, of, greek, and, armenian, nationalities, from, crimea, they, had, industry, horticulture, and, agriculture, which, constituted, a, significant, part, of, the, crimean, khan, s, income, the, fact, that, the, crimean, christians, were, burdened, to, the, last, degree, by, the, khan, s, extortions, and, therefore, the, tax, exemption, granted, to, them, in, the, new, place, should, have, inclined, them, in, favor, of, the, measure, conceived, by, the, russian, government, was, in, favor, of, the, feasibility, of, resettlement, thus, the, matter, was, resolved, and, suvorov, was, entrusted, with, its, execution, in, the, second, half, of, september, 1778, the, resettlement, ended, more, than, 31, 000, souls, were, evicted, the, greeks, were, mostly, settled, between, the, rivers, berda, and, kalmius, along, the, river, solyonaya, and, all, the, way, to, azov, the, armenians, near, rostov, and, generally, on, the, don, rumyantsev, reported, to, the, empress, that, the, withdrawal, of, the, christians, can, be, regarded, as, a, conquest, of, a, noble, province, 130, 000, rubles, were, spent, for, transportation, and, food, petrushevsky, suggests, that, food, itself, cost, very, cheap, because, suvorov, bought, from, the, same, christians, 50, 000, quarters, of, bread, which, coming, locally, to, the, shops, cost, half, as, much, as, delivered, from, russia, what, resulted, in, savings, of, 100, 000, rubles, suvorov, s, orders, were, distinguished, by, remarkable, and, calculated, prudence, he, had, put, his, heart, into, this, business, more, than, half, a, year, later, when, the, case, was, almost, submitted, to, the, archives, suvorov, still, felt, as, if, he, had, a, moral, obligation, towards, the, settlers, and, wrote, to, potemkin, the, crimean, settlers, suffer, many, shortcomings, in, their, present, state, look, upon, them, with, a, merciful, eye, who, have, sacrificed, so, much, to, the, throne, relish, their, bitter, remembrance, after, suvorov, organized, the, resettlement, of, armenian, migrants, displaced, from, crimea, catherine, gave, them, permission, to, establish, a, new, city, named, nor, nakhichevan, by, the, armenians, in, addition, alexander, suvorov, would, later, found, the, city, of, tiraspol, 1792, now, the, capital, of, transnistria, in, 1778, alexander, as, well, prevented, a, turkish, landing, on, the, crimean, peninsula, thwarting, another, russo, turkish, war, in, 1780, he, became, a, lieutenant, general, and, in, 1783, general, of, the, infantry, upon, completion, of, his, tour, of, duty, in, the,

hours, straight, suvorov, remained, a, close, confidant, of, catherine, but, he, had, a, negative, relationship, with, her, son, and, heir, apparent, paul, he, even, his, own, regiment, of, russian, soldiers, whom, he, dressed, up, in, prussian, style, uniforms, and, paraded, around, suvorov, was, strongly, opposed, to, these, uniforms, and, had, fought, hard, for, catherine, to, get, rid, of, similar, uniforms, that, were, used, by, russians, up, until, 1784, when, catherine, died, of, a, stroke, in, 1796, paul, i, was, crowned, emperor, and, brought, back, these, outdated, uniforms, it, is, considered, that, in, the, same, year, the, golden, age, of, russian, nobility, and, of, the, russian, empire, came, to, an, end, along, with, catherine, the, great, suvorov, was, not, happy, with, paul, s, reforms, and, disregarded, his, orders, to, train, new, soldiers, in, this, prussian, manner, which, he, considered, cruel, and, useless, paul, was, infuriated, and, dismissed, suvorov, exiling, him, to, his, estate, konchanskoye, near, borovichi, and, kept, under, surveillance, his, correspondence, with, his, wife, who, had, remained, at, moscow, for, his, marriage, relations, had, not, been, happy, was, also, tampered, with, it, is, recorded, that, on, sundays, he, tolled, the, bell, for, church, and, sang, among, the, rustics, in, the, village, choir, on, week, days, he, worked, among, them, in, a, smock, frock, in, february, 1799, paul, i, worried, about, the, victories, of, france, in, europe, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, at, the, insistence, of, the, coalition, leaders, was, forced, to, reinstate, suvorov, as, field, marshal, alexander, suvorov, was, given, command, of, the, austro, russian, army, and, sent, to, drive, france, s, forces, out, of, italy, for, subordination, of, the, austrian, soldiers, to, a, general, of, foreign, service, it, was, deemed, necessary, to, place, him, a, step, above, the, most, senior, austrian, generals, of, the, army, of, italy, also, granting, the, field, marshal, of, the, hre, suvorov, and, napoleon, never, met, in, battle, because, napoleon, was, campaigning, in, egypt, and, syria, at, the, time, however, in, 1799, suvorov, erased, practically, all, of, the, gains, napoleon, had, made, for, france, in, northern, italy, during, 1796, and, 1797, defeating, some, of, the, republic, s, top, generals, moreau, and, sch, rer, at, the, adda, river, lecco, vaprio, d, adda, cassano, d, adda, verderio, superiore, again, moreau, at, san, giuliano, spinetta, marengo, macdonald, near, the, rivers, of, tidone, trebbia, nure, at, the, trebbia, battle, and, joubert, along, with, moreau, at, novi, but, the, russians, lost, the, battle, of, bassignana, all, the, major, battles, adda, trebbia, novi, are, of, the, most, decisive, nature, besides, the, following, italian, fortresses, fell, before, suvorov, brescia, 21, april, peschiera, del, garda, tortona, pizzighettone, april, alessandria, mantua, july, suvorov, captured, milan, and, turin, as, well, as, citadels, of, these, cities, and, became, a, hero, to, those, who, opposed, the, french, revolution, allied, forces, also, took, the, towns, of, parma, and, modena, the, capitals, of, the, duchies, of, parma, piacenza, and, modena, reggio, respectively, the, british, drawn, many, caricatures, dedicated, to, suvorov, s, expedition, the, french, client, states, cisalpine, republic, and, piedmontese, republic, collapsed, in, the, face, of, suvorov, s, onset, admiral, ushakov, sent, to, the, mediterranean, for, support, to, suvorov, in, 1799, completed, the, five, month, siege, of, corfu, 1798, 1799, and, put, an, end, to, the, french, occupation, of, the, ionian, islands, in, greece, on, receiving, news, of, the, capture, of, corfu, suvorov, exclaimed, our, great, peter, is, alive, what, he, after, defeating, the, swedish, fleet, near, land, in, 1714, said, namely, that, nature, has, produced, only, one, russia, she, has, no, rival, we, see, it, now, hooray, to, the, russian, fleet, i, now, say, to, myself, why, wasn, t, i, at, least, a, midshipman, at, corfu, the, sister, republic, in, the, south, the, parthenopean, also, fell, before, the, british, royal, navy, ushakov, s, naval, squadron, and, the, local, rebels, since, jacques, macdonald, at, the, head, of, the, army, of, naples, was, forced, to, abandon, southern, italy, to, meet, suvorov, at, the, trebbia, leaving, only, weak, garrisons, in, the, neapolitan, lands, macdonald, attacked, ott, s, small, force, whereupon, suvorov, quickly, concentrated, most, of, his, army, against, macdonald, and, threw, his, men, into, the, fray, immediately, after, a, hard, march, this, confrontation, near, the, trebbia, proved, to, be, the, toughest, french, defeat, of, suvorov, s, italian, campaign, by, the, end, of, the, retreat, macdonald, had, barely, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, men, left, out, of, an, army, of, 35, 000, the, battle, of, novi, on, the, other, hand, is, the, most, difficult, victory, in, suvorov, s, career, largely, because, the, french, had, strong, defensive, positions, and, the, allies, could, not, fully, deploy, their, superior, cavalry, as, a, consequence, however, the, russo, austrian, victory, turned, into, a, complete, rout, for, the, french, army, its, troops, lost, 16, 000, of, their, comrades, in, arms, in, total, and, were, driven, from, italy, save, for, a, handful, in, the, maritime, alps, and, around, genoa, but, the, hofkriegsrat, did, not, choose, to, take, advantage, and, sent, suvorov, with, his, austrian, and, russian, forces, to, switzerland, suvorov, himself, gained, the, title, of, prince, of, the, house, of, savoy, and, the, rank, of, grand, marshal, of, the, piedmont, troops, from, the, king, of, sardinia, and, after, the, trebbian, battle, the, title, of, prince, of, italy, or, knyaz, italiysky, like, gustavus, adolphus, turenne, frederick, ii, the, great, alexander, the, great, hannibal, and, caesar, in, military, affairs, alexander, vasilyevich, was, not, vulnerable, at, any, point, rushing, with, speed, to, the, most, important, places, and, carefully, observed, the, principle, of, force, concentration, all, his, life, at, san, giuliano, vecchio, 1st, marengo, for, example, his, troops, gathered, more, than, double, superiority, and, at, novi, not, so, considerable, but, at, least, reaching, about, 38, per, cent, which, was, still, offset, by, the, french, army, s, favourable, position, the, combat, of, lecco, fought, as, a, diversionary, maneuver, brought, virtually, no, advantage, to, either, side, but, at, the, beginning, before, the, reinforcements, the, russian, troops, were, far, inferior, in, numbers, at, the, combat, of, vaprio, part, of, cassano, passing, through, a, river, obstacle, the, coalition, eventually, managed, to, concentrate, four, thousand, more, troops, in, practice, than, the, french, did, largely, also, at, the, expense, of, the, cossacks, although, in, the, middle, of, the, battle, the, french, had, a, twofold, preponderance, in, numbers, in, the, end, there, were, about, 11, 000, austrians, and, cossacks, versus, 7, 000, french, but, french, troops, began, to, give, up, their, footholds, before, the, remaining, austrian, battalions, arrived, notwithstanding, all, the, outcome, of, the, combat, at, vaprio, d, adda, could, have, been, the, only, outcome, the, timely, arrival, of, 3, 000, from, s, rurier, s, division, 6, 000, from, victor, s, division, 2, 000, he, could, have, left, at, cassano, d, adda, on, the, way, would, be, 16, 000, french, led, by, moreau, against, 11, 000, of, the, enemy, at, cassano, d, adda, suvorov, allocated, about, 13, 000, austrians, against, approximately, 3, 000, french, from, the, divisions, of, paul, grenier, and, claude, victor, along, with, reinforcements, who, had, taken, up, strong, defences, behind, the, stream, but, it, was, the, combat, of, vaprio, that, was, decisive, and, pivotal, at, verderio, the, s, rurier, detachment, cut, off, during, the, combat, at, vaprio, d, adda, was, surrounded, and, pinned, down, by, the, river, thus, with, roughly, equal, strength, overall, having, a, minimum, of, 65, 000, men, at, his, disposal, against, the, 58, 000, available, for, active, operations, in, the, field, as, part, of, the, french, army, of, italy, suvorov, was, able, to, use, every, advantage, he, had, in, the, theater, to, win, a, complete, victory, at, the, battle, of, cassano, the, blame, lies, with, barth, lemy, sch, rer, he, scattered, an, even, cordon, along, the, whole, river, on, the, more, important, stretch, from, lecco, to, cassano, d, adda, 42, km, 26, mi, there, were, no, more, than, 12, 000, meanwhile, suvorov, had, 42, 000, on, the, same, stretch, near, the, trebbia, in, contrast, to, the, above, macdonald, had, one, and, a, half, superiority, this, circumstance, is, explained, by, the, fact, that, kray, despite, the, order, of, suvorov, did, not, send, him, reinforcements, based, on, the, direct, command, of, holy, roman, emperor, francis, ii, not, to, separate, any, forces, before, the, surrender, of, mantua, it, was, too, late, for, the, commander, in, chief, to, find, out, at, the, battle, of, the, trebbia, on, the, first, day, at, the, tidone, river, the, french, had, 19, 000, men, against, his, 14, 15, 000, and, were, thrown, back, by, the, trebbia, river, itself, on, the, second, day, the, forces, were, equal, and, on, the, third, day, suvorov, with, some, 22, 000, men, beat, macdonald, s, force, of, 33, 000, 35, 000, suvorov, then, rushed, into, a, fighting, pursuit, and, at, the, nure, river, similar, to, verderio, an, entire, auvergne, regiment, was, captured, after, a, short, battle, despite, the, restraining, influence, of, the, hofkriegsrat, suvorov, always, held, the, initiative, in, his, hands, when, dealing, with, the, enemy, if, the, french, sometimes, tried, to, catch, him, e, g, the, movements, of, moreau, and, macdonald, to, join, at, tortona, the, allies, concentrated, and, dealt, brutal, blows, like, at, the, trebbia, as, for, novi, joubert, advancing, from, genoa, to, tortona, and, expecting, to, catch, the, allied, field, army, scattered, unexpectedly, met, suvorov, and, his, strike, fist, behind, novi, ligure, but, perseverance, in, the, battle, of, novi, came, to, the, point, that, when, the, russian, attacks, were, unsuccessful, suvorov, got, off, his, horse, and, rolling, on, the, ground, shouted, dig, a, grave, for, me, i, will, not, survive, this, day, and, then, resumed, his, attacks, moreau, spoke, of, suvorov, in, this, way, what, can, you, say, of, a, general, so, resolute, to, a, superhuman, degree, and, who, would, perish, himself, and, let, his, army, perish, to, the, last, man, rather, than, retreat, a, single, pace, as, a, disadvantage, to, his, decisiveness, field, marshal, suvorov, famous, for, the, storming, of, izmail, did, not, want, to, storm, the, citadels, of, italian, cities, and, preferred, to, resort, in, accordance, with, the, situation, to, blockade, and, siege, nevertheless, during, the, italian, campaign, of, 1799, suvorov, s, talent, expressed, itself, fully, and, comprehensively, nikolay, orlov, describes, when, assessing, suvorov, s, actions, one, must, always, keep, in, mind, the, unfavourable, situation, for, the, commander, the, environment, in, which, he, was, meaning, mainly, the, inconvenience, of, commanding, the, allied, troops, originating, from, the, difference, in, political, aspirations, of, the, allied, governments, and, the, binding, influence, of, the, hofkriegsrat, the, polish, forces, had, a, no, small, quantity, of, militias, and, the, turks, and, tartars, were, largely, unstable, hordes, true, all, these, opponents, were, characterised, by, fanatical, bravery, it, was, not, easy, for, suvorov, to, overcome, them, the, wars, brought, suvorov, practice, from, which, he, took, out, extensive, experience, his, talent, gradually, developed, and, strengthened, in, this, fight, the, commander, learned, the, essence, the, spirit, of, war, in, 1799, suvorov, s, enemies, were, troops, purely, regular, crowned, with, the, glory, of, victories, over, the, german, armies, considered, themselves, the, best, in, europe, and, were, led, by, some, of, the, best, generals, of, the, time, including, jean, victor, moreau, a, man, in, the, prime, of, life, 35, who, was, generally, respected, in, the, army, distinguished, by, his, theoretical, knowledge, of, the, art, of, war, and, combat, experience, affability, and, high, intelligence, he, was, not, a, high, minded, genius, but, the, presence, of, mind, and, unwavering, equanimity, gave, him, the, ability, to, come, out, with, honour, from, the, most, critical, circumstances, at, any, rate, after, bonaparte, he, was, the, best, french, general, of, the, time, the, talented, lazare, hoche, was, no, longer, alive, winning, the, famous, victory, at, hohenlinden, a, year, later, the, theater, of, war, was, not, like, those, steppes, swamps, and, forests, among, which, the, commander, had, hitherto, fought, in, the, war, with, the, french, suvorov, was, not, only, commander, in, chief, independently, acting, in, the, theater, of, operations, but, in, addition, he, was, in, charge, of, the, allied, army, a, matter, even, more, difficult, for, a, commander, and, in, the, battles, of, cassano, and, novi, the, austrians, formed, the, bulk, of, the, army, while, at, cassano, only, irregular, cossack, troops, participated, from, the, russian, side, including, the, encirclement, of, the, french, detachment, at, verderio, it, should, also, be, noted, that, suvorov, being, fiery, and, irritable, was, able, to, restrain, himself, in, many, cases, after, the, victorious, italian, theater, suvorov, planned, to, march, on, paris, but, instead, was, ordered, to, switzerland, to, join, up, with, the, russian, forces, already, there, and, drive, the, french, out, the, russian, army, under, general, korsakov, was, defeated, by, andr, mass, na, at, z, rich, and, friedrich, von, hotze, s, austrian, army, was, defeated, by, jean, de, dieu, soult, at, the, linth, river, before, suvorov, could, reach, and, unite, with, them, all, i, have, defeated, myself, jela, i, and, lincken, who, are, now, pinned, down, in, glarus, marshal, suvorov, is, surrounded, on, all, sides, he, will, be, the, one, forced, to, surrender, said, gabriel, jean, joseph, molitor, to, franz, von, auffenberg, and, pyotr, ivanovich, bagration, surrounded, by, mass, na, s, 77, 000, french, troops, suvorov, with, a, force, of, 18, 000, russian, regulars, and, 5, 000, cossacks, exhausted, and, short, of, provisions, led, a, strategic, withdrawal, from, the, alps, while, fighting, off, the, french, early, on, in, the, path, going, to, join, with, the, not, yet, defeated, korsakov, he, struggled, against, general, claude, lecourbe, and, overcame, the, st, gotthard, and, oberalp, that, goes, round, oberalpsee, mountain, passes, suvorov, s, troops, beat, the, french, out, of, hospental, situated, in, the, urseren, valley, followed, by, the, so, called, teufelsbr, cke, or, devil, s, bridge, located, in, the, schoellenen, gorge, and, the, urnerloch, rock, tunnel, all, these, interventions, were, not, without, great, losses, for, suvorov, but, in, his, main, attack, where, he, concentrated, some, 6, 700, against, 6, 000, frenchmen, he, suffered, relatively, the, same, casualties, as, his, opponent, however, suvorov, s, troops, were, at, their, wits, end, russian, troops, of, andrey, grigoryevich, rosenberg, crossed, the, lukmanier, pass, austrian, troops, of, franz, auffenberg, overcame, the, chr, zli, pass, while, suvorov, himself, also, later, traversed, more, remote, passes, such, as, chinzig, and, pragel, bragell, before, climbing, the, 8, 000, foot, mountain, rossstock, marching, over, rocks, had, worn, out, the, soldiers, inadequate, footwear, of, which, many, were, now, even, deprived, uniforms, were, often, in, tatters, rifles, and, bayonets, were, rusting, from, the, constant, dampness, and, the, men, were, starving, for, lack, of, adequate, supplies, they, were, exhausted, surrounded, by, impassable, mountains, in, freezing, cold, and, one, way, or, another, faced, a, french, army, far, superior, in, numbers, and, equipment, cossack, reconnaissance, units, instead, of, the, austrians, of, lincken, found, the, french, there, france, s, forces, meanwhile, blocked, off, many, important, places, for, troop, movements, and, on, september, 29, 18, os, still, uncertain, but, informed, about, the, fate, of, korsakov, and, hotze, from, the, testimony, of, french, prisoners, suvorov, assembled, a, council, of, war, in, the, refectory, of, the, franciscan, monastery, of, saint, joseph, which, decided, to, pave, the, way, for, the, army, toward, glarus, during, the, council, the, russian, commander, showed, himself, extremely, resolute, not, to, surrender, blamed, the, austrian, allies, for, all, the, hardships, they, were, forced, to, suffer, and, proposed, what, appeared, to, him, to, be, the, only, possible, solution, suvorov, dictated, the, disposition, in, the, vanguard, appointed, to, go, auffenberg, who, came, out, on, the, 29th, and, the, next, day, the, rest, of, the, troops, except, for, rosenberg, s, corps, and, foerster, s, division, which, remained, in, the, rearguard, and, must, hold, the, enemy, coming, out, of, schwyz, until, all, the, packs, had, passed, over, the, mountain, bragell, rosenberg, was, ordered, to, hold, firm, to, repel, the, french, with, all, his, strength, but, not, to, pursue, him, beyond, schwyz, alexander, suvorov, s, speech, was, written, down, from, the, words, of, pyotr, ivanovich, bagration, made, a, huge, impression, on, everyone, who, attended, especially, angry, and, menacing, looked, derfelden, and, bagration, we, are, surrounded, by, mountains, surrounded, by, a, strong, enemy, proud, of, victory, since, the, pruth, expedition, under, the, sovereign, emperor, peter, the, great, russian, troops, have, never, been, in, such, a, perilous, position, to, go, back, is, dishonorable, i, have, never, retreated,

russians, god, is, with, us, between, 30, september, and, 1, october, 1799, suvorov, s, vanguard, of, 2, 100, men, led, by, bagration, was, able, to, break, through, the, kl, ntal, valley, with, kl, ntalersee, inside, and, reached, the, goal, it, inflicted, 1, 000, killed, or, wounded, and, another, 1, 000, captured, to, a, french, force, of, 6, 500, men, however, bagration, tried, to, push, further, than, glarus, failing, to, do, so, he, was, finally, stopped, by, molitor, s, troops, when, molitor, took, up, a, position, at, netstal, he, held, for, a, long, time, in, spite, of, bagration, s, persistent, attacks, finally, driven, out, of, netstal, with, the, loss, of, a, cannon, a, banner, and, 300, prisoners, molitor, retreated, to, n, fels, on, both, banks, of, the, river, linth, here, the, french, took, a, strong, position, where, they, again, repulsed, bagration, long, and, hard, no, matter, how, weakened, bagration, s, troops, were, by, the, previous, battles, and, heavy, march, through, the, mountains, they, had, so, far, gained, superior, numbers, over, molitor, s, detachment, molitor, had, gone, into, full, retreat, but, the, long, expected, advance, troops, of, gazan, soon, came, to, his, aid, the, french, now, received, an, overwhelming, strength, and, knocked, them, out, of, n, fels, bagration, in, turn, attacked, n, fels, and, drove, off, the, french, who, then, went, on, the, attack, again, five, or, six, times, the, village, passed, from, hand, to, hand, and, when, last, time, it, was, occupied, by, the, russians, bagration, received, orders, from, suvorov, to, withdraw, to, netstal, where, at, that, time, the, rest, of, derfelden, s, troops, were, already, concentrated, it, was, evening, when, bagration, came, out, of, n, fels, noticing, this, gazan, moved, all, his, forces, to, the, attack, and, himself, led, the, grenadiers, to, the, bayonets, but, this, time, the, french, were, also, repulsed, and, bagration, s, troops, retreated, quite, calmly, to, netstal, meanwhile, on, the, same, days, the, rearguard, of, 7, 000, men, out, of, a, total, of, 14, 000, commanded, by, andrey, rosenberg, who, according, to, plan, was, assigned, the, task, of, deterrence, met, with, mass, na, s, forces, which, numbered, up, to, 15, 000, men, out, of, 24, 000, in, the, muotatal, muota, valley, formerly, muttental, suvorov, ordered, to, hold, on, there, at, all, costs, and, the, rearguard, suffering, 500, to, 700, casualties, routed, the, french, by, inflicting, them, between, 2, 700, and, 4, 000, losses, in, two, days, more, than, 1, 000, prisoners, alone, were, taken, including, a, general, and, 15, officers, suvorov, reported, to, paul, 6, 500, french, dead, wounded, and, prisoners, of, war, in, two, days, of, fighting, 1, 600, september, 30, and, 4, 500, october, 1, while, suvorov, was, fighting, the, french, the, short, lived, roman, sister, republic, had, also, fallen, before, the, troops, of, the, restored, kingdom, of, naples, despite, all, the, russian, successes, on, the, battlefield, they, were, not, going, to, win, the, campaign, suvorov, hoped, to, make, the, way, for, his, exhausted, ill, supplied, troops, over, the, swiss, passes, to, the, upper, alpine, rhine, and, arrive, at, vorarlberg, where, the, army, much, shattered, after, a, lot, of, crossing, and, fighting, almost, destitute, of, horses, and, artillery, went, into, winter, quarters, when, suvorov, battled, his, way, through, the, snow, capped, alps, his, army, was, checked, but, never, defeated, suvorov, refused, to, call, it, a, retreat, and, commenced, a, trek, through, the, deep, snows, of, the, panixer, ringenkopf, pass, and, into, the, 9, 000, foot, mountains, of, the, b, ndner, oberland, by, then, deep, in, snow, thousands, of, russians, slipped, from, the, cliffs, or, succumbed, to, cold, and, hunger, eventually, escaping, encirclement, and, reached, chur, on, the, rhine, with, the, bulk, of, his, army, intact, at, 16, 000, men, after, the, troops, reached, chur, they, crossed, another, pass, in, the, form, of, the, st, luzisteig, and, hence, left, the, territory, of, present, day, switzerland, for, this, marvel, of,

his, courtesy, to, the, point, that, in, reply, to, suvorov, s, new, year, greetings, he, asked, him, to, share, them, with, his, troops, if, he, the, tsar, was, worthy, of, it, and, expressed, his, desire, to, be, worthy, of, such, an, army, the, famous, admiral, lord, nelson, who, according, to, the, russian, ambassador, in, london, was, at, that, time, together, with, suvorov, the, idol, of, the, english, nation, also, sent, the, generalissimo, an, enthusiastic, letter, there, is, no, man, in, europe, he, wrote, who, loves, you, as, i, do, all, marvel, like, nelson, at, your, great, exploits, but, he, loves, you, for, your, contempt, of, wealth, someone, called, suvorov, the, land, nelson, nelson, was, very, flattered, by, this, someone, else, said, that, there, is, a, very, great, similarity, in, appearance, between, the, russian, generalissimo, and, the, british, admiral, rejoicing, at, this, nelson, added, in, a, letter, to, suvorov, that, although, his, nelson, s, deeds, can, not, equal, with, those, of, suvorov, but, he, asked, suvorov, not, to, deprive, him, of, the, dear, name, of, a, loving, brother, and, sincere, friend, suvorov, answered, nelson, in, the, same, way, and, expressed, his, pleasure, that, their, portraits, certify, the, similarity, existing, between, the, originals, but, in, particular, was, proud, of, the, fact, that, the, two, were, alike, in, their, way, of, thinking, he, also, received, a, warm, welcome, from, his, old, associate, the, prince, of, coburg, the, grand, duke, constantine, went, to, coburg, through, whom, suvorov,

earlier, he, had, correspondence, with, archduke, charles, which, however, was, of, a, sharp, nature, suvorov, received, greetings, and, congratulations, even, from, strangers, early, in, 1800,

as, one, of, the, modern, military, geniuses, along, with, napoleon, and, frederick, the, great, in, 1799, napoleon, himself, warned, the, directory, that, that, they, would, not, be, able, to, stop, suvorov, unless, they, found, generals, with, special, skill, in, fighting, him, in, 1807, macdonald, declared, to, the, russian, ambassador, at, a, reception, with, napoleon, and, a, crowd, around, that, this, crew, would, never, have, seen, the, tuileries, if, you, had, had, a, second, suvorov, while, on, a, campaign, he, reportedly, lived, as, a, private, soldier, sleeping, on, straw, and, contenting, himself, with, the, humblest, fare, suvorov, saw, victory, as, dependent, on, the, morale, training, and, initiative, of, the, front, line, soldier, in, battle, he, emphasized, speed, and, mobility, accuracy, of, gunfire, and, the, use, of, the, bayonet, as, well, as, detailed, planning, and, careful, strategy, his, motto, coup, d, oeil, glazomer, speed, bystrota, impetus, natisk, he, abandoned, traditional, drills, and, communicated, with, his, troops, in, clear, and, understandable, ways, suvorov, also, took, great, care, of, his, army, s, supplies, and, living, conditions,

to, keep, the, welfare, and, fitness, of, the, troops, in, the, forefront, of, their, attentions, he, severely, punished, often, with, courts, martial, any, officers, who, senselessly, or, cruelly, drilled, their, troops, or, who, failed, to, maintain, his, high, sanitary, and, health, standards, although, a, strict, disciplinarian, he, took, extenuating, circumstances, into, account, once, a, soldier, or, officer, had, been, punished, or, reprimanded, suvorov, would, do, his, utmost, to, rehabilitate, him, suvorov, did, not, know, retreat, he, constantly, acted, offensively, and, in, accordance, with, the, situation, was, looking, for, a, fight, not, evaded, it, but, he, did, not, overuse, the, battles, the, fight, always, turned, out, to, be, appropriate, necessary, in, the, operation, and, moreover, decisive, if, he, got, the, chance, to, confront, his, enemy, he, used, it, with, all, the, energy, suvorov, s, guiding, principle, was, to, detect, the, weakest, point, of, an, enemy, and, focus, an, attack, upon, that, area, he, would, send, forth, his, units, in, small, groups, as, they, arrived, on, the, battlefield, to, sustain, momentum, suvorov, used, aimed, fire, instead, of, repeated, barrages, from, line, infantry, and, applied, light, infantrymen, as, skirmishers, and, sharpshooters, he, used, a, variety, of, army, sizes, and, types, of, formations, against, different, foes, squares, against, the, turks, lines, against, poles, and, columns, against, the, french, suvorov, believed, that, a, military, man, must, know, the, languages, of, the, nations, with, whom, he, is, fighting, so, he, developed, a, fluent, command, of, french, german, greek, ottoman, turkish, italian, polish, and, latin, as, well, as, some, knowledge, of, arabic, finnish, and, persian, he, also, rejected, a, suggestion, that, the, russian, army, rid, itself, of, its, musicians, saying, music, doubles, trebles, the, force, of, an, army, according, to, d, s, mirsky, suvorov, gave, much, attention, to, the, form, of, his, correspondence, and, especially, of, his, orders, of, the, day, these, latter, are, highly, original, deliberately, aiming, at, unexpected, and, striking, effects, their, style, is, a, succession, of, nervous, staccato, sentences, which, produce, the, effect, of, blow, and, flashes, suvorov, s, official, reports, often, assume, a, memorable, and, striking, form, his, writings, are, as, different, from, the, common, run, of, classical, prose, as, his, tactics, were, from, those, of, frederick, or, marlborough, mikhail, ivanovich, dragomirov, declared, that, he, based, his, teaching, on, suvorov, s, practice, which, he, held, as, representative, of, the, fundamental, truths, of, war, and, of, the, military, qualities, of, the, russian, nation, suvorov, s, maneuvering, of, the, alps, led, him, to, be, called, the, russian, hannibal, and, was, also, referred, to, as, the, russian, mars, and, god, of, war, the, french, king, louis, xviii, compared, suvorov, to, attila, suvorov, considered, hannibal, alexander, the, great, julius, caesar, and, napoleon, bonaparte, to, be, the, greatest, military, commanders, of, all, time, suvorov, is, seen, as, having, anticipated, napoleon, s, tactics, and, is, regarded, as, being, on, par, with, him, in, terms, of, military, genius, like, napoleon, suvorov, believed, that, opportunities, in, battle, are, created, by, fortune, but, exploited, by, intelligence, experience, and, an, intuitive, vision, to, suvorov, mastery, of, the, art, and, science, of, war, was, not, therefore, purely, instinctive, suvorov, kept, up, with, events, in, europe, by, subscribing, to, foreign, newspapers, and, journals, he, had, written, to, one, of, his, nephews, in, 1796, that, young, bonaparte, how, he, moves, he, is, a, hero, a, giant, a, magician, he, overcomes, nature, and, he, overcomes, men, he, turned, the, alps, as, if, they, did, not, exist, he, has, hidden, their, frightful, rocks, in, his, pocket, and, tucked, up, his, army, up, the, right, sleeve, of, his, uniform, the, enemy, scarcely, catches, sight, his, soldiers, before, he, throws, his, troops, at, them, like, a, thunderbolt, from, jupiter, spreading, terror, in, all, directions, and, crushing, the, scattered, bands, of, austrians, and, piedmontese, my, god, how, he, moves, the, first, time, he, assumed, command, he, cut, to, the, heart, of, tactics, like, a, sword, slashing, through, the, gordian, knot, he, disregards, the, odds, against, him, he, attacks, the, enemy, wherever, they, are, to, be, found, and, he, defeats, them, in, detail, he, knows, that, shock, is, irresistibe, and, that, says, it, all, his, enemies, will, continue, in, their, old, routine, subject, to, the, scribblers, in, the, cabinet, but, as, for, him, he, carries, his, council, of, war, in, his, head, his, operations, are, as, free, as, the, air, he, breathes, my, conclusion, is, this, that, as, long, as, general, bonaparte, keeps, his, wits, about, him, he, will, be, victorious, he, possesses, the, higher, elements, of, the, military, art, in, a, happy, balance, but, if, unfortunately, for, him, he, throws, himself, into, the, whirlpool, of, politics, he, will, lose, the, coference, of, his, thoughts, and, he, will, be, lost, suvorov, held, napoleon, in, high, regard, despite, not, living, to, see, the, napoleonic, wars, however, napoleon, did, not, reciprocate, suvorov, s, esteem, assessing, suvorov, as, having, the, soul, of, a, great, commander, but, not, the, brains, he, was, extremely, strong, willed, he, was, amazingly, active, and, utterly, fearless, but, he, was, as, devoid, of, genius, as, he, was, ignorant, of, the, art, of, war, despite, the, two, never, facing, each, other, military, historians, often, debate, between, suvorov, and, napoleon, as, to, who, was, the, superior, commander, suvorov, was, buried, in, saint, petersburg, in, the, alexander, nevsky, lavra, his, gravestone, states, simply, here, lies, suvorov, within, a, year, after, his, death, paul, i, was, murdered, in, his, bedroom, for, his, disastrous, leadership, by, a, band, of, dismissed, officers, and, his, son, and, successor, alexander, i, erected, a, statue, to, suvorov, s, memory, in, the, field, of, mars, suvorov, s, revolutionary, methods, of, waging, war, endure, in, his, prodigious, literary, documentary, and, epistolary, output, he, was, famed, for, his, military, writings, the, most, well, known, being, the, science, of, victory, the, science, of, winning, and, suzdal, regulations, and, lesser, known, works, such, as, rules, for, the, kuban, and, crimean, corps, rules, for, the, conduct, of, military, actions, in, the, mountains, written, during, his, swiss, campaign, and, rules, for, the, medical, officers, suvorov, was, also, noted, for, several, of, his, sayings, what, is, difficult, in, training, will, become, easy, in, a, battle, perish, yourself, but, rescue, your, comrade, fight, the, enemy, with, the, weapons, he, lacks, one, minute, can, decide, the, outcome, of, the, battle, one, hour, the, outcome, of, the, campaign,
