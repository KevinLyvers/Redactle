diogenes, d, a, d, n, i, z, dy, oj, in, eez, ancient, greek, romanized, diog, n, s, also, known, as, diogenes, the, cynic, diog, n, s, ho, kynik, s, or, diogenes, of, sinope, was, a, greek, philosopher, and, one, of, the, founders, of, cynicism, he, was, born, in, sinope, an, ionian, colony, on, the, black, sea, coast, of, anatolia, in, 412, or, 404, bc, and, died, at, corinth, in, 323, bc, diogenes, was, a, controversial, figure, he, was, banished, or, he, fled, from, sinope, over, debasement, of, currency, he, was, the, son, of, the, mintmaster, of, sinope, and, there, is, some, debate, as, to, whether, it, was, he, his, father, or, both, who, had, debased, the, sinopian, currency, after, his, hasty, departure, from, sinope, he, moved, to, athens, where, he, proceeded, to, criticize, many, conventions, of, athens, of, that, day, there, are, many, tales, about, him, following, antisthenes, and, becoming, his, faithful, hound, diogenes, was, captured, by, pirates, and, sold, into, slavery, eventually, settling, in, corinth, there, he, passed, his, philosophy, of, cynicism, to, crates, who, taught, it, to, zeno, of, citium, who, fashioned, it, into, the, school, of, stoicism, one, of, the, most, enduring, schools, of, greek, philosophy, no, authenticated, writings, of, diogenes, survive, but, there, are, some, details, of, his, life, from, anecdotes, chreia, especially, from, diogenes, la, rtius, book, lives, and, opinions, of, eminent, philosophers, and, some, other, sources, diogenes, made, a, virtue, of, poverty, he, begged, for, a, living, and, often, slept, in, a, large, ceramic, jar, or, pithos, in, the, marketplace, he, used, his, simple, lifestyle, and, behavior, to, criticize, the, social, values, and, institutions, of, what, he, saw, as, a, corrupt, confused, society, he, had, a, reputation, for, sleeping, and, eating, wherever, he, chose, in, a, highly, non, traditional, fashion, and, took, to, toughening, himself, against, nature, he, declared, himself, a, cosmopolitan, and, a, citizen, of, the, world, rather, than, claiming, allegiance, to, just, one, place, he, modeled, himself, on, the, example, of, heracles, believing, that, virtue, was, better, revealed, in, action, than, in, theory, he, became, notorious, for, his, philosophical, stunts, such, as, carrying, a, lamp, during, the, day, claiming, to, be, looking, for, a, man, often, rendered, in, english, as, looking, for, an, honest, man, as, diogenes, viewed, the, people, around, him, as, dishonest, and, irrational, he, criticized, plato, disputed, his, interpretation, of, socrates, and, sabotaged, his, lectures, sometimes, distracting, listeners, by, bringing, food, and, eating, during, the, discussions, diogenes, was, also, noted, for, having, mocked, alexander, the, great, both, in, public, and, to, his, face, when, he, visited, corinth, in, 336, bc, nothing, is, known, about, diogenes, s, early, life, except, that, his, father, hicesias, was, a, banker, it, seems, likely, that, diogenes, was, also, enrolled, into, the, banking, business, aiding, his, father, at, some, point, the, exact, date, is, unknown, hicesias, and, diogenes, became, involved, in, a, scandal, involving, the, adulteration, or, debasement, of, the, currency, and, diogenes, was, exiled, from, the, city, and, lost, his, citizenship, and, all, his, material, possessions, this, aspect, of, the, story, seems, to, be, corroborated, by, archaeology, large, numbers, of, defaced, coins, smashed, with, a, large, chisel, stamp, have, been, discovered, at, sinope, dating, from, the, middle, of, the, 4th, century, bc, and, other, coins, of, the, time, bear, the, name, of, hicesias, as, the, official, who, minted, them, during, this, time, there, was, much, counterfeit, money, circulating, in, sinope, the, coins, were, deliberately, defaced, in, order, to, render, them, worthless, as, legal, tender, sinope, was, being, disputed, between, pro, persian, and, pro, greek, factions, in, the, 4th, century, and, there, may, have, been, political, rather, than, financial, motives, behind, the, act, according, to, one, story, diogenes, went, to, the, oracle, at, delphi, to, ask, for, her, advice, and, was, told, that, he, should, deface, the, currency, following, the, debacle, in, sinope, diogenes, decided, that, the, oracle, meant, that, he, should, deface, the, political, currency, rather, than, actual, coins, he, traveled, to, athens, and, made, it, his, life, s, goal, to, challenge, established, customs, and, values, he, argued, that, instead, of, being, troubled, about, the, true, nature, of, evil, people, merely, rely, on, customary, interpretations, diogenes, arrived, in, athens, with, a, slave, named, manes, who, escaped, from, him, shortly, thereafter, with, characteristic, humor, diogenes, dismissed, his, ill, fortune, by, saying, if, manes, can, live, without, diogenes, why, not, diogenes, without, manes, diogenes, would, mock, such, a, relation, of, extreme, dependency, he, found, the, figure, of, a, master, who, could, do, nothing, for, himself, contemptibly, helpless, he, was, attracted, by, the, ascetic, teaching, of, antisthenes, a, student, of, socrates, when, diogenes, asked, antisthenes, to, mentor, him, antisthenes, ignored, him, and, reportedly, eventually, beat, him, off, with, his, staff, diogenes, responded, strike, for, you, will, find, no, wood, hard, enough, to, keep, me, away, from, you, so, long, as, i, think, you, ve, something, to, say, diogenes, became, antisthenes, s, pupil, despite, the, brutality, with, which, he, was, initially, received, whether, the, two, ever, really, met, is, still, uncertain, but, he, surpassed, his, master, in, both, reputation, and, the, austerity, of, his, life, he, considered, his, avoidance, of, earthly, pleasures, a, contrast, to, and, commentary, on, contemporary, athenian, behaviors, this, attitude, was, grounded, in, a, disdain, for, what, he, regarded, as, the, folly, pretence, vanity, self, deception, and, artificiality, of, human, conduct, the, stories, told, of, diogenes, illustrate, the, logical, consistency, of, his, character, he, inured, himself, to, the, weather, by, living, in, a, clay, wine, jar, belonging, to, the, temple, of, cybele, he, destroyed, the, single, wooden, bowl, he, possessed, on, seeing, a, peasant, boy, drink, from, the, hollow, of, his, hands, he, then, exclaimed, fool, that, i, am, to, have, been, carrying, superfluous, baggage, all, this, time, it, was, contrary, to, athenian, customs, to, eat, within, the, marketplace, and, still, he, would, eat, there, for, as, he, explained, when, rebuked, it, was, during, the, time, he, was, in, the, marketplace, that, he, felt, hungry, he, used, to, stroll, about, in, full, daylight, with, a, lamp, when, asked, what, he, was, doing, he, would, answer, i, am, looking, for, a, man, modern, sources, often, say, that, diogenes, was, looking, for, an, honest, man, but, in, ancient, sources, he, is, simply, looking, for, a, man, this, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, in, his, view, the, unreasoning, behavior, of, the, people, around, him, meant, that, they, did, not, qualify, as, men, diogenes, looked, for, a, man, but, reputedly, found, nothing, but, rascals, and, scoundrels, diogenes, taught, by, living, example, he, tried, to, demonstrate, that, wisdom, and, happiness, belong, to, the, man, who, is, independent, of, society, and, that, civilization, is, regressive, he, scorned, not, only, family, and, socio, political, organization, but, also, property, rights, and, reputation, he, even, rejected, traditional, ideas, about, human, decency, in, addition, to, eating, in, the, marketplace, diogenes, is, said, to, have, urinated, on, some, people, who, insulted, him, defecated, in, the, theatre, masturbated, in, public, and, pointed, at, people, with, his, middle, finger, which, was, considered, insulting, diogenes, la, rtius, also, relates, that, diogenes, would, spit, and, fart, in, public, when, asked, about, his, eating, in, public, diogenes, said, if, taking, breakfast, is, nothing, out, of, place, then, it, is, nothing, out, of, place, in, the, marketplace, on, the, indecency, of, his, masturbating, in, public, he, would, say, if, only, it, were, as, easy, to, banish, hunger, by, rubbing, my, belly, diogenes, had, nothing, but, disdain, for, plato, and, his, abstract, philosophy, diogenes, viewed, antisthenes, as, the, true, heir, to, socrates, and, shared, his, love, of, virtue, and, indifference, to, wealth, together, with, a, disdain, for, general, opinion, diogenes, shared, socrates, s, belief, that, he, could, function, as, doctor, to, men, s, souls, and, improve, them, morally, while, at, the, same, time, holding, contempt, for, their, obtuseness, plato, once, described, diogenes, as, a, socrates, gone, mad, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, when, plato, gave, the, tongue, in, cheek, definition, of, man, as, featherless, bipeds, diogenes, plucked, a, chicken, and, brought, it, into, plato, s, academy, saying, here, is, plato, s, man, and, so, the, academy, added, with, broad, flat, nails, to, the, definition, according, to, a, story, which, seems, to, have, originated, with, menippus, of, gadara, diogenes, was, captured, by, pirates, while, on, voyage, to, aegina, and, sold, as, a, slave, in, crete, to, a, corinthian, named, xeniades, being, asked, his, trade, he, replied, that, he, knew, no, trade, but, that, of, governing, men, and, that, he, wished, to, be, sold, to, a, man, who, needed, a, master, xeniades, liked, his, spirit, and, hired, diogenes, to, tutor, his, children, as, tutor, to, xeniades, s, two, sons, it, is, said, that, he, lived, in, corinth, for, the, rest, of, his, life, which, he, devoted, to, preaching, the, doctrines, of, virtuous, self, control, there, are, many, stories, about, what, actually, happened, to, him, after, his, time, with, xeniades, s, two, sons, there, are, stories, stating, he, was, set, free, after, he, became, a, cherished, member, of, the, household, while, one, says, he, was, set, free, almost, immediately, and, still, another, states, that, he, grew, old, and, died, at, xeniades, s, house, in, corinth, he, is, even, said, to, have, lectured, to, large, audiences, at, the, isthmian, games, although, most, of, the, stories, about, his, living, in, a, jar, are, located, in, athens, lucian, recounts, a, tale, where, he, lived, in, a, jar, near, the, gymnasium, in, corinth, it, was, in, corinth, that, a, meeting, between, alexander, the, great, and, diogenes, is, supposed, to, have, taken, place, these, stories, may, be, apocryphal, the, accounts, of, plutarch, and, diogenes, la, rtius, recount, that, they, exchanged, only, a, few, words, while, diogenes, was, relaxing, in, the, morning, sunlight, alexander, thrilled, to, meet, the, famous, philosopher, asked, if, there, was, any, favour, he, might, do, for, him, diogenes, replied, yes, stand, out, of, my, sunlight, alexander, then, declared, if, i, were, not, alexander, then, i, should, wish, to, be, diogenes, in, another, account, of, the, conversation, alexander, found, the, philosopher, looking, attentively, at, a, pile, of, human, bones, diogenes, explained, i, am, searching, for, the, bones, of, your, father, but, cannot, distinguish, them, from, those, of, a, slave, there, are, conflicting, accounts, of, diogenes, s, death, his, contemporaries, alleged, that, he, held, his, breath, until, he, died, although, other, accounts, of, his, death, say, he, became, ill, from, eating, raw, octopus, or, from, an, infected, dog, bite, when, asked, how, he, wished, to, be, buried, he, left, instructions, to, be, thrown, outside, the, city, wall, so, that, wild, animals, could, feast, on, his, body, when, asked, if, he, minded, this, he, said, not, at, all, as, long, as, you, provide, me, with, a, stick, to, chase, the, creatures, away, when, asked, how, he, could, use, the, stick, since, he, would, lack, awareness, he, replied, if, i, lack, awareness, then, why, should, i, care, what, happens, to, me, when, i, am, dead, to, the, end, diogenes, made, fun, of, people, s, excessive, concern, with, the, proper, treatment, of, the, dead, the, corinthians, erected, to, his, memory, a, pillar, on, which, rested, a, dog, of, parian, marble, it, was, alleged, by, plutarch, and, diogenes, la, rtius, that, both, diogenes, and, alexander, died, on, the, same, day, however, the, actual, death, date, of, neither, man, can, be, verified, along, with, antisthenes, and, crates, of, thebes, diogenes, is, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, cynicism, the, ideas, of, diogenes, like, those, of, most, other, cynics, must, be, arrived, at, indirectly, fifty, one, writings, of, diogenes, survive, as, part, of, the, spurious, cynic, epistles, though, he, is, reported, to, have, authored, over, ten, books, and, seven, tragedies, that, do, not, survive, cynic, ideas, are, inseparable, from, cynic, practice, therefore, what, is, known, about, diogenes, is, contained, in, anecdotes, concerning, his, life, and, sayings, attributed, to, him, in, a, number, of, scattered, classical, sources, many, anecdotes, of, diogenes, refer, to, his, dog, like, behavior, and, his, praise, of, a, dog, s, virtues, it, is, not, known, whether, diogenes, was, insulted, with, the, epithet, doggish, and, made, a, virtue, of, it, or, whether, he, first, took, up, the, dog, theme, himself, when, asked, why, he, was, called, a, dog, he, replied, i, fawn, on, those, who, give, me, anything, i, yelp, at, those, who, refuse, and, i, set, my, teeth, in, rascals, one, explanation, offered, in, ancient, times, for, why, the, cynics, were, called, dogs, was, that, antisthenes, taught, in, the, cynosarges, gymnasium, at, athens, the, word, cynosarges, means, the, place, of, the, white, dog, later, cynics, also, sought, to, turn, the, word, to, their, advantage, as, a, later, commentator, explained, there, are, four, reasons, why, the, cynics, are, so, named, first, because, of, the, indifference, of, their, way, of, life, for, they, make, a, cult, of, indifference, and, like, dogs, eat, and, make, love, in, public, go, barefoot, and, sleep, in, tubs, and, at, crossroads, the, second, reason, is, that, the, dog, is, a, shameless, animal, and, they, make, a, cult, of, shamelessness, not, as, being, beneath, modesty, but, as, superior, to, it, the, third, reason, is, that, the, dog, is, a, good, guard, and, they, guard, the, tenets, of, their, philosophy, the, fourth, reason, is, that, the, dog, is, a, discriminating, animal, which, can, distinguish, between, its, friends, and, enemies, so, do, they, recognize, as, friends, those, who, are, suited, to, philosophy, and, receive, them, kindly, while, those, unfitted, they, drive, away, like, dogs, by, barking, at, them, diogenes, believed, human, beings, live, hypocritically, and, would, do, well, to, study, the, dog, besides, performing, natural, body, functions, in, public, with, ease, a, dog, will, eat, anything, and, makes, no, fuss, about, where, to, sleep, dogs, live, in, the, present, and, have, no, use, for, pretentious, philosophy, they, know, instinctively, who, is, friend, and, who, is, foe, diogenes, stated, that, other, dogs, bite, their, enemies, i, bite, my, friends, to, save, them, diogenes, maintained, that, all, the, artificial, growths, of, society, were, incompatible, with, happiness, and, that, morality, implies, a, return, to, the, simplicity, of, nature, so, great, was, his, austerity, and, simplicity, that, the, stoics, would, later, claim, him, to, be, a, wise, man, or, sophos, in, his, words, humans, have, complicated, every, simple, gift, of, the, gods, although, socrates, had, previously, identified, himself, as, belonging, to, the, world, rather, than, a, city, diogenes, is, credited, with, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, cosmopolitan, when, he, was, asked, from, where, he, came, he, replied, i, am, a, citizen, of, the, world, cosmopolites, this, was, a, radical, claim, in, a, world, where, a, man, s, identity, was, intimately, tied, to, his, citizenship, of, a, particular, city, state, as, an, exile, and, an, outcast, a, man, with, no, social, identity, diogenes, made, a, mark, on, his, contemporaries, both, in, ancient, and, in, modern, times, diogenes, s, personality, has, appealed, strongly, to, sculptors, and, to, painters, ancient, busts, exist, in, the, museums, of, the, vatican, the, louvre, and, the, capitol, the, interview, between, diogenes, and, alexander, is, represented, in, an, ancient, marble, bas, relief, found, in, the, villa, albani, in, raphael, s, fresco, the, school, of, athens, a, lone, reclining, figure, in, the, foreground, represents, diogenes, the, many, allusions, to, dogs, in, shakespeare, s, timon, of, athens, are, references, to, the, school, of, cynicism, that, could, be, interpreted, as, suggesting, a, parallel, between, the, misanthropic, hermit, timon, and, diogenes, but, shakespeare, would, have, had, access, to, michel, de, montaigne, s, essay, of, democritus, and, heraclitus, which, emphasised, their, differences, timon, actively, wishes, men, ill, and, shuns, them, as, dangerous, whereas, diogenes, esteems, them, so, little, that, contact, with, them, could, not, disturb, him, timonism, is, in, fact, often, contrasted, with, cynicism, cynics, saw, what, people, could, be, and, were, angered, by, what, they, had, become, timonists, felt, humans, were, hopelessly, stupid, uncaring, by, nature, and, so, saw, no, hope, for, change, the, philosopher, s, name, was, adopted, by, the, fictional, diogenes, club, an, organization, that, sherlock, holmes, brother, mycroft, holmes, belongs, to, in, the, story, the, greek, interpreter, by, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, it, is, called, such, as, its, members, are, educated, yet, untalkative, and, have, a, dislike, of, socialising, much, like, the, philosopher, himself, diogenes, s, name, has, been, applied, to, a, behavioural, disorder, characterised, by, apparently, involuntary, self, neglect, and, hoarding, the, disorder, afflicts, the, elderly, and, is, quite, inappropriately, named, as, diogenes, deliberately, rejected, common, standards, of, material, comfort, and, was, anything, but, a, hoarder
