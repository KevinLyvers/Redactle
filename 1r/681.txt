to, purchase, the, landline, telecommunications, service, provider, from, the, mexican, government, when, the, opportunity, for, slim, to, purchase, the, telco, presented, itself, and, materialized, when, mexico, began, privatizing, its, national, industries, at, the, turn, of, the, 1980s, slim, was, an, early, investment, backer, in, telmex, where, the, concomitant, income, producing, cash,
