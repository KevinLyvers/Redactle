osman, i, or, osman, ghazi, ottoman, turkish, romanized, o, s, m, n, z, turkish, i, osman, or, osman, gazi, died, 1323, 4, was, the, founder, of, the, ottoman, empire, first, known, as, the, ottoman, beylik, or, emirate, while, initially, a, small, turkoman, principality, during, osman, s, lifetime, his, beylik, transformed, into, a, vast, empire, in, the, centuries, after, his, death, it, existed, until, 1922, shortly, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, when, the, sultanate, was, abolished, owing, to, the, scarcity, of, historical, sources, dating, from, his, lifetime, very, little, factual, information, about, osman, has, survived, not, a, single, written, source, survives, from, osman, s, reign, and, the, ottomans, did, not, record, the, history, of, osman, s, life, until, the, fifteenth, century, more, than, a, hundred, years, after, his, death, because, of, this, historians, find, it, very, challenging, to, differentiate, between, fact, and, myth, in, the, many, stories, told, about, him, one, historian, has, even, gone, so, far, as, to, declare, it, impossible, describing, the, period, of, osman, s, life, as, a, black, hole, according, to, later, ottoman, tradition, osman, s, ancestors, were, descendants, of, the, kay, tribe, of, oghuz, turks, however, many, scholars, of, the, early, ottomans, regard, it, as, a, later, fabrication, meant, to, reinforce, dynastic, legitimacy, the, ottoman, principality, was, one, of, many, anatolian, beyliks, that, emerged, in, the, second, half, of, the, thirteenth, century, situated, in, the, region, of, bithynia, in, the, north, of, asia, minor, osman, s, principality, found, itself, particularly, well, placed, to, launch, attacks, on, the, vulnerable, byzantine, empire, which, his, descendants, would, eventually, go, on, to, conquer, some, scholars, have, argued, that, osman, s, original, name, was, turkish, probably, atman, or, ataman, and, was, only, later, changed, to, o, s, m, n, of, arabic, origin, the, earliest, byzantine, sources, including, osman, s, contemporary, and, greek, historian, george, pachymeres, spell, his, name, as, atouman, or, atman, whereas, greek, sources, regularly, render, both, the, arabic, form, u, th, m, n, and, the, turkish, version, o, s, m, n, with, or, an, early, arabic, source, mentioning, him, also, writes, rather, than, in, one, instance, osman, may, thus, have, adopted, the, more, prestigious, muslim, name, later, in, his, life, turkish, historian, halil, nalc, k, argued, that, the, hypotheses, that, osman, was, in, fact, named, ataman, per, george, pachymeres, and, that, he, came, from, the, desth, i, qipchaq, north, of, the, black, sea, are, both, remote, possibilities, arab, scholars, like, shihab, al, umari, and, ibn, khaldun, used, the, name, othman, while, ibn, battuta, who, visited, the, region, during, orhan, s, reign, called, him, osmanc, k, also, spelled, othm, njiq, or, osmanjiq, the, suffix, c, k, or, cuk, indicates, the, diminutive, in, turkish, thus, he, was, known, by, the, name, of, osmancik, which, means, osman, the, little, to, differentiate, between, him, and, the, third, rashidun, caliph, uthman, the, great, most, sources, agree, that, the, ottoman, turks, belonged, to, the, kay, oghuz, turkic, clan, who, according, to, ottoman, traditions, fled, their, native, homeland, in, central, asia, during, the, early, 13th, century, due, to, the, mongol, invasions, the, clan, settled, in, anatolia, in, a, region, belonging, to, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, r, m, other, sources, claim, that, the, kay, clan, moved, to, anatolia, two, centuries, earlier, than, the, previously, mentioned, date, alongside, the, seljuks, when, they, left, transoxiana, to, khurasan, around, 1040, to, reside, near, the, city, of, merv, then, the, kay, clan, moved, towards, eastern, anatolia, after, 1071, ce, where, it, displaced, other, turkic, clans, later, it, became, involved, in, the, army, of, sultan, kayqubad, i, and, fought, against, the, khwarazmians, mongols, and, byzantines, who, were, raiding, seljuk, lands, according, to, several, sources, the, kay, warriors, were, known, for, filling, first, lines, in, battles, and, their, fighting, skills, and, bravery, were, among, the, major, factors, the, seljuks, were, victorious, in, many, battles, this, fact, prompted, sultan, kayqubad, to, appoint, ertu, rul, the, clan, s, emir, as, a, moqaddam, lieutenant, and, to, reward, the, kay, s, some, fertile, lands, near, ankara, where, they, settled, and, remained, in, the, service, of, the, sultan, for, several, years, later, ertu, rul, was, granted, dominion, over, the, town, of, s, t, in, northwestern, anatolia, on, the, byzantine, frontier, he, also, obtained, the, title, of, u, beyli, i, or, u, bey, literally, marcher, lord, granting, this, title, was, in, line, with, the, traditions, of, the, seljuk, sultanate, which, is, rewarding, any, clan, chieftain, who, rises, to, power, and, is, joined, by, a, number, of, smaller, clans, the, title, of, marcher, lord, however, ertu, rul, had, far, reaching, political, ambitions, he, sought, to, expand, beyond, the, lands, rewarded, to, him, thus, he, started, raiding, the, byzantine, possessions, in, the, name, of, the, sultan, successfully, conquering, several, towns, and, villages, and, slowly, expanding, his, dominion, during, the, half, of, the, century, he, spent, as, a, seljuk, governor, in, 1281, ertu, rul, died, at, nearly, 90, years, of, age, although, the, exact, date, of, osman, s, birth, is, unspecified, some, sources, indicate, that, he, was, born, on, 13, february, 1258, the, exact, same, day, the, mongol, hordes, invaded, baghdad, killing, its, inhabitants, and, ravaging, its, landmarks, other, sources, such, as, the, 16th, century, ottoman, historian, kemalpa, az, de, say, that, osman, was, most, likely, born, around, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, possibly, in, 1254, 5, information, related, to, the, early, life, of, osman, is, limited, however, the, few, available, sources, agree, that, he, was, born, in, the, town, of, s, t, which, his, father, ertu, rul, took, as, the, capital, of, his, emirate, the, reason, for, the, lack, of, information, available, about, this, stage, of, osman, s, life, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, oldest, known, source, about, this, time, period, was, written, about, a, hundred, years, after, osman, s, death, among, these, sources, are, destan, tevarih, i, al, i, osman, the, oral, history, of, the, ottomans, written, in, the, 14th, century, by, the, ottoman, poet, and, court, physician, t, cedd, n, br, h, m, bin, h, z, r, better, known, as, ahmed, 1334, 1413, behcet, t, tev, r, h, the, joy, of, histories, by, krullah, d, 1464, and, tevarih, i, l, i, osman, history, of, the, ottomans, by, dervi, ahmed, k, known, as, kpa, az, de, 1400, 1484, additionally, these, remaining, sources, are, not, the, originals, but, rather, copies, or, copies, of, the, copies, that, were, rewritten, over, the, years, leading, to, a, probable, loss, or, altering, in, the, information, in, fact, it, is, accepted, that, ottoman, european, and, byzantine, sources, are, not, very, reliable, when, considering, the, origins, of, osman, and, his, clan, on, one, hand, the, oldest, known, records, originally, written, by, the, ottomans, all, date, back, to, the, period, that, followed, the, conquest, of, constantinople, 1453, ce, on, the, other, hand, none, of, the, byzantine, historians, did, refer, in, their, writings, to, the, origin, of, the, ottomans, as, for, european, historians, these, turkic, muslim, peoples, were, outside, of, their, interest, however, that, changed, after, a, century, of, this, period, when, the, ottomans, began, to, pose, a, threat, to, europe, the, ottoman, historian, kemalpa, az, de, mentioned, that, osman, was, ertu, rul, s, youngest, son, and, that, he, was, raised, in, the, traditional, nomadic, turkic, ways, he, learned, wrestling, swordsmanship, horse, riding, arrow, shooting, and, falconry, from, an, early, age, he, quickly, mastered, the, previously, mentioned, skills, outperforming, all, his, brothers, he, was, also, taught, the, principles, of, islam, and, was, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, sufi, sheikhs, mostly, his, mentor, sheikh, edebali, and, this, was, reflected, in, his, personality, and, lifestyle, in, terms, of, proportions, the, most, popular, and, classic, narration, is, that, osman, is, the, grandson, of, s, leyman, ah, who, died, drowning, while, crossing, the, euphrates, river, on, horseback, the, turkish, historian, y, lmaz, ztuna, considers, that, osman, s, grandfather, and, ertu, rul, s, father, is, called, g, nd, z, alp, saying, that, it, is, more, likely, that, s, leyman, ah, is, a, name, stuck, in, anatolian, popular, memory, and, it, actually, refers, to, s, leyman, bin, qutulmish, who, founded, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, r, m, ztuna, adds, that, it, is, possible, that, ottoman, historians, tried, forming, a, connection, between, the, ottomans, and, the, seljuks, especially, since, the, ottomans, appeared, on, the, stage, of, history, claiming, to, be, the, legitimate, successors, of, the, seljuks, based, on, this, osman, s, assumed, lineage, is, as, follows, osman, bin, ertu, rul, bin, g, nd, z, alp, bin, kaya, alp, bin, g, kalp, bin, sarquk, alp, bin, kay, alp, other, researchers, agree, that, the, connection, between, ertu, rul, osman, and, the, seljuks, may, have, been, largely, invented, by, court, chroniclers, a, century, later, and, the, true, origins, of, the, ottomans, thus, remain, obscure, on, the, other, hand, some, ottoman, sources, indicate, further, lineage, to, osman, and, the, oghuz, turks, which, is, closer, to, myth, than, reality, saying, that, these, people, are, descendants, of, japheth, son, of, noah, and, that, osman, s, genealogical, tree, contains, 52, ancestors, or, more, and, ends, with, the, prophet, noah, himself, this, lineage, includes, g, kalp, and, oghuz, han, who, is, said, to, be, the, father, of, g, kalp, and, all, the, oghuz, turkic, peoples, including, the, seljuks, the, exact, date, of, osman, s, birth, is, unknown, and, very, little, is, known, about, his, early, life, and, origins, due, to, the, scarcity, of, sources, and, the, many, myths, and, legends, which, came, to, be, told, about, him, by, the, ottomans, in, later, centuries, he, was, most, likely, born, around, the, middle, of, the, thirteenth, century, possibly, in, 1254, 5, the, date, given, by, the, sixteenth, century, ottoman, historian, kemalpa, azade, according, to, ottoman, tradition, osman, s, father, ertu, rul, led, the, turkic, kay, tribe, west, from, central, asia, into, anatolia, fleeing, the, mongol, onslaught, he, then, pledged, allegiance, to, the, sultan, of, the, anatolian, seljuks, who, granted, him, dominion, over, the, town, of, s, t, on, the, byzantine, frontier, this, connection, between, ertu, rul, and, the, seljuks, however, was, largely, invented, by, court, chroniclers, a, century, later, and, the, true, origins, of, the, ottomans, thus, remain, obscure, according, to, the, karamanid, historian, shikari, osman, was, a, lowborn, y, r, k, and, shepherd, almost, nothing, is, known, for, certain, about, osman, s, early, activities, except, that, he, controlled, the, region, around, the, town, of, s, t, and, from, there, launched, raids, against, the, neighboring, byzantine, empire, the, first, datable, event, in, osman, s, life, is, the, battle, of, bapheus, in, 1301, or, 1302, in, which, he, defeated, a, byzantine, force, sent, to, counter, him, osman, appears, to, have, followed, the, strategy, of, increasing, his, territories, at, the, expense, of, the, byzantines, while, avoiding, conflict, with, his, more, powerful, turkish, neighbors, his, first, advances, were, through, the, passes, which, lead, from, the, barren, areas, of, northern, phrygia, near, modern, eski, ehir, into, the, more, fertile, plains, of, bithynia, according, to, stanford, shaw, these, conquests, were, achieved, against, the, local, byzantine, nobles, some, of, whom, were, defeated, in, battle, others, being, absorbed, peacefully, by, purchase, contracts, marriage, contracts, and, the, like, osman, became, emir, or, bey, upon, his, father, s, death, around, 1281, according, to, some, historians, osman, s, accession, to, power, wasn, t, peaceful, as, he, had, to, fight, his, relatives, before, he, got, hold, of, his, clan, s, leadership, one, of, osman, s, major, rivals, was, his, uncle, d, ndar, bey, who, might, have, plotted, to, kill, his, nephew, or, rebelled, against, him, when, the, latter, decided, to, attack, a, small, greek, island, d, ndar, bey, saw, that, osman, s, ambition, as, a, threat, that, might, put, the, whole, clan, in, danger, however, osman, had, to, pull, out, his, sword, to, kill, his, uncle, for, disobeying, in, the, vilayetname, a, book, containing, the, narrations, about, haji, bektash, veli, osman, s, younger, uncle, was, the, one, who, became, bey, after, ertu, rul, s, death, during, that, time, osman, and, several, other, warriors, started, organizing, raids, on, byzantine, lands, adjacent, to, s, t, such, as, yarhisar, bilecik, neg, l, and, znik, as, a, result, the, byzantine, tekfur, governor, of, bursa, was, provoked, and, he, sent, envoys, to, the, seljuk, sultan, al, eddin, kayqubad, iii, complaining, about, these, constant, assaults, thus, the, sultan, ordered, g, nd, z, alp, to, bring, forth, his, young, nephew, to, stand, before, him, and, so, osman, was, arrested, and, sent, to, konya, according, to, this, narration, sultan, kayqubad, admired, osman, s, courage, and, deeds, and, didn, t, wish, to, punish, him, instead, osman, was, sent, to, j, bakt, wal, to, consider, his, matter, osman, was, warmly, received, by, the, sufi, mystic, who, then, ordered, his, release, saying, i, have, been, waiting, for, someone, like, him, for, years, after, that, j, bakt, wal, wrapped, osman, s, head, with, the, same, turban, associated, with, sufi, sheikhs, and, sent, him, back, to, konya, with, a, message, to, the, sultan, asking, that, osman, to, become, the, kay, emir, thus, osman, became, the, clan, s, leader, from, a, military, point, of, view, the, location, of, osman, s, beylik, had, a, significant, impact, on, his, success, as, a, conquering, warrior, his, capital, s, t, was, located, on, a, hill, in, a, well, defended, position, mediating, the, main, road, from, constantinople, to, konya, the, importance, of, this, site, emerged, due, to, the, political, fragmentation, of, anatolia, that, gave, small, states, greater, importance, than, they, originally, had, being, an, emir, to, a, beylik, bordering, byzantine, lands, osman, had, the, opportunity, to, direct, all, his, efforts, towards, war, and, jihad, following, the, footsteps, of, the, seljuks, with, intentions, to, conquer, all, byzantine, territories, and, absorb, them, into, the, islamic, caliphate, encouraged, by, the, weakness, of, the, ancient, empire, and, its, ongoing, wars, in, europe, osman, had, the, chance, to, expand, towards, western, anatolia, crossing, the, dardanelles, to, southeastern, europe, commenting, on, these, actions, some, historians, argue, that, osman, s, strategy, of, increasing, his, territories, at, the, expense, of, the, byzantines, was, due, to, his, intention, to, avoid, conflicts, with, his, more, powerful, turkic, neighbours, politically, osman, showed, great, skills, forming, and, applying, new, administrative, systems, in, his, beylik, during, his, reign, the, ottomans, made, great, strides, towards, transitioning, from, the, nomadic, tribe, system, to, settling, down, in, permanent, settlements, this, helped, them, consolidate, their, position, and, rapidly, develop, into, a, major, power, moreover, the, beylik, s, location, in, northwestern, anatolia, next, to, christendom, imposed, a, military, policy, on, the, ottomans, which, gave, them, better, chances, to, grow, and, expand, compared, to, the, beyliaks, of, the, interior, osman, s, beylik, was, also, relatively, far, from, both, the, mongol, invasions, and, the, influence, of, the, powerful, turkoman, beyliks, in, southern, and, southwestern, anatolia, add, to, that, its, proximity, to, the, silk, road, linking, byzantine, lands, in, the, west, to, areas, controlled, by, the, mongols, in, the, east, gave, it, prominent, strategic, and, economic, characteristics, also, the, osmanic, beylik, was, the, only, islamic, base, facing, the, yet, unconquered, byzantine, regions, which, made, it, a, magnet, to, many, turkomen, farmers, warriors, and, dervishes, fleeing, the, mongols, and, aspiring, to, conquer, new, lands, for, economic, and, religious, reasons, osman, i, had, a, close, relationship, with, a, local, religious, leader, of, dervishes, named, sheikh, edebali, whose, daughter, he, married, a, story, emerged, among, later, ottoman, writers, to, explain, the, relationship, between, the, two, men, in, which, osman, had, a, dream, while, staying, in, the, sheikh, s, house, the, story, appears, in, the, late, fifteenth, century, chronicle, of, a, kpa, azade, as, follows, he, saw, that, a, moon, arose, from, the, holy, man, s, breast, and, came, to, sink, in, his, own, breast, a, tree, then, sprouted, from, his, navel, and, its, shade, compassed, the, world, beneath, this, shade, there, were, mountains, and, streams, flowed, forth, from, the, foot, of, each, mountain, some, people, drank, from, these, running, waters, others, watered, gardens, while, yet, others, caused, fountains, to, flow, when, osman, awoke, he, told, the, story, to, the, holy, man, who, said, osman, my, son, congratulations, for, god, has, given, the, imperial, office, to, you, and, your, descendants, and, my, daughter, malhun, shall, be, your, wife, the, dream, became, an, important, foundational, myth, for, the, empire, imbuing, the, house, of, osman, with, god, given, authority, over, the, earth, and, providing, its, fifteenth, century, audience, with, an, explanation, for, ottoman, success, the, dream, story, may, also, have, served, as, a, form, of, compact, just, as, god, promised, to, provide, osman, and, his, descendants, with, sovereignty, it, was, also, implicit, that, it, was, the, duty, of, osman, to, provide, his, subjects, with, prosperity, according, to, the, bektashi, narration, whose, accuracy, cannot, be, confirmed, since, it, was, only, mentioned, in, bektashi, sources, plus, the, fact, that, it, did, not, enjoy, much, support, from, the, majority, of, researchers, j, bakt, wal, was, one, of, the, waf, yyah, tariqah, dervishes, a, murid, of, b, b, eliy, s, al, khor, s, n, once, b, b, eliy, s, died, both, j, bakt, wal, and, sheikh, edebali, became, among, his, 60, successors, and, grandmasters, of, the, ahyan, r, m, brotherhood, of, warriors, and, farmers, who, enjoyed, great, influence, among, the, people, when, osman, married, sheikh, edebali, s, daughter, he, secured, his, control, over, the, brotherhood, and, soon, became, their, new, grandmaster, as, a, result, of, this, marriage, all, the, ahyan, sheikhs, became, under, ottoman, control, this, has, a, major, impact, on, the, establishment, and, development, of, the, osmanic, beylik, after, osman, s, death, during, the, reign, of, his, son, orhan, some, argue, that, osman, s, marriage, to, sheikh, edebali, s, daughter, was, his, first, brilliant, political, undertake, on, the, other, hand, turkish, historian, professor, cemal, kafadar, considers, that, the, intermarriage, between, the, osmanic, and, edebali, s, houses, explains, the, hostilities, that, later, rose, between, the, ottomans, and, the, germiyanids, since, the, germiyanid, turkoman, house, was, rewarded, lands, and, titles, by, the, seljuks, because, of, their, services, in, subjugating, the, b, b, revolt, in, 1240, and, because, sheikh, edebali, was, considered, by, his, followers, a, leader, and, successor, to, b, b, ish, q, they, all, became, the, focus, of, attention, of, the, germiyanids, kafadar, adds, that, early, in, osman, reign, the, young, emir, showed, political, ingenuity, forming, relations, with, his, neighbours, osman, s, alliances, transcended, tribal, ethnic, and, religious, lines, and, he, may, have, followed, his, instinct, and, the, requirements, of, his, political, aspirations, not, mistaking, the, future, results, of, the, family, connections, he, created, and, secured, for, his, son, after, him, osman, reconstituted, the, political, culture, of, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, r, m, in, line, with, the, needs, of, his, beylik, he, was, more, creative, than, his, turkomen, neighbours, in, combining, turkic, islamic, and, byzantine, traditions, additionally, the, emir, also, cooperated, with, the, byzantine, tekfurs, of, the, neighbouring, cities, and, villages, he, forged, an, agreement, so, his, clan, whenever, they, move, between, grazing, areas, in, the, summer, leave, their, belongings, in, the, byzantine, fortress, of, bilecik, and, upon, their, return, they, give, its, governor, a, token, of, appreciation, in, the, form, of, cheese, and, butter, made, from, sheep, milk, and, preserved, in, animal, skins, or, a, good, carpet, made, from, wool, this, agreement, reflects, the, coexistence, between, herders, farmers, and, urban, dwellers, during, osman, s, reign, osman, s, friendship, with, k, se, mihal, governor, of, chirmenkia, modern, harmank, y, was, the, culmination, of, this, coexistence, between, muslims, and, byzantines, as, for, his, relations, with, other, peoples, such, as, the, mongols, most, of, whom, moved, to, the, borders, of, western, anatolia, and, the, germiyanid, turkomen, it, was, hostile, that, is, because, the, turks, in, general, despised, the, mongols, and, the, germiyanids, were, probably, of, non, oghuz, origin, osman, allied, with, the, ahyan, r, m, brotherhood, they, formed, organized, groups, members, in, each, of, which, worked, in, a, single, trade, the, brotherhood, took, the, responsibility, to, preserve, justice, prevent, injustice, stop, oppression, follow, sharia, law, dictate, good, morals, and, carry, out, military, duties, if, the, need, arises, to, defend, their, rights, and, the, rights, of, muslims, the, emir, also, allied, with, newly, arrived, turkomen, clans, to, anatolia, in, general, the, nomads, have, always, had, a, strong, militarized, spirit, compared, to, people, installed, in, the, cities, thus, the, clans, were, more, active, and, effective, than, their, city, dwelling, kin, soon, enough, they, become, the, beating, heart, of, the, seljuk, border, provinces, in, total, and, the, osmanic, beylik, in, particular, osman, also, enticed, many, turkomen, from, the, region, of, paphlagonia, to, join, his, forces, these, turkomen, were, fine, warriors, eager, for, jihad, and, conquest, each, of, them, followed, a, tariqah, an, order, of, sufism, and, was, supervised, by, a, sheikh, who, taught, them, the, meaning, of, jihad, alongside, many, islamic, principles, however, another, section, of, these, turkomen, did, not, have, close, ties, to, islam, for, various, reasons, thus, osman, entrusted, them, to, several, sheikhs, and, dervishes, to, be, given, proper, islamic, education, and, be, satiated, with, the, values, that, glorify, conquests, aiming, to, spread, the, word, of, islam, in, fact, these, sheikhs, and, dervishes, were, very, enthusiastic, about, promoting, the, turuq, of, the, khorasani, walis, and, osman, s, request, gave, them, this, chance, as, for, the, ruling, hierarchy, osman, was, firstly, subordinate, to, the, chobanid, emir, in, kastamonu, followed, by, the, seljuk, sultan, through, the, germiyanid, bey, in, k, tahya, who, was, in, turn, subordinate, to, the, mongol, ilkhan, in, tabriz, during, this, period, the, seljuk, sultans, had, lost, their, power, over, their, local, emirs, and, the, mongol, ilkhan, practised, his, authority, in, anatolia, through, his, appointed, generals, where, he, requested, that, every, local, governor, including, osman, sends, him, soldiers, whenever, he, requests, so, as, for, the, hierarchy, of, name, delivering, in, khu, bah, imams, used, to, pray, for, the, guidance, of, the, abbasid, caliph, in, egypt, first, the, mongol, ilkhan, in, tabriz, seljuk, sultan, in, konya, and, finally, the, local, bey, or, emir, until, the, end, of, thirteenth, century, osman, i, s, conquests, include, the, areas, of, bilecik, belokomis, yeni, ehir, melangeia, neg, l, angelokomis, and, yarhisar, k, pr, hisar, and, byzantine, castles, in, these, areas, according, to, shaw, osman, s, first, real, conquests, followed, the, collapse, of, seljuk, authority, when, he, was, able, to, occupy, the, fortresses, of, kulucahisar, and, eski, ehir, then, he, captured, the, first, significant, city, in, his, territories, yeni, ehir, which, became, the, ottoman, capital, in, 1302, after, soundly, defeating, a, byzantine, force, near, nicaea, osman, began, settling, his, forces, closer, to, byzantine, controlled, areas, alarmed, by, osman, s, growing, influence, the, byzantines, gradually, fled, the, anatolian, countryside, byzantine, leadership, attempted, to, contain, ottoman, expansion, but, their, efforts, were, poorly, organized, and, ineffectual, meanwhile, osman, spent, the, remainder, of, his, reign, expanding, his, control, in, two, directions, north, along, the, course, of, the, sakarya, river, and, southwest, towards, the, sea, of, marmara, achieving, his, objectives, by, 1308, osman, s, last, campaign, was, against, the, city, of, bursa, although, osman, did, not, physically, participate, in, the, battle, the, victory, at, bursa, proved, to, be, extremely, vital, for, the, ottomans, as, the, city, served, as, a, staging, ground, against, the, byzantines, in, constantinople, and, as, a, newly, adorned, capital, for, osman, s, son, orhan, ottoman, tradition, holds, that, osman, died, just, after, the, capture, of, bursa, but, some, scholars, have, argued, that, his, death, should, be, placed, in, 1324, the, year, of, orhan, s, accession, after, establishing, his, beylik, osman, had, to, fight, on, two, fronts, one, against, the, byzantine, and, the, other, against, the, turkomen, beyliks, that, opposed, his, rule, especially, the, germiyanids, osman, focused, on, expanding, at, the, expense, of, the, byzantines, and, since, that, time, the, primary, ottoman, goal, became, the, conquest, of, the, remaining, byzantine, lands, some, accounts, indicate, that, the, first, battle, osman, launched, against, the, byzantines, was, aimed, to, revenge, a, defeat, that, he, suffered, in, the, spring, of, 1284, or, 1285, where, the, byzantines, led, by, the, tekfur, of, bursa, ambushed, him, and, his, men, it, is, in, doubt, that, osman, knew, about, this, ambush, from, one, of, his, spies, nevertheless, he, chose, to, clash, with, the, byzantines, and, he, was, defeated, and, forced, to, withdraw, with, casualties, including, his, nephew, koca, saruhan, bey, son, of, savc, bey, based, on, this, around, 1286, osman, went, forward, to, kulacahisar, at, the, head, of, a, military, force, of, three, hundred, fighters, it, was, a, fortress, located, two, leagues, away, from, neg, l, within, the, scope, of, mount, uluda, the, emir, attacked, the, fort, at, night, and, managed, to, conquer, it, extending, his, beylik, northwards, toward, lake, znik, s, proximity, the, ottoman, victory, at, kulacahisar, triggered, the, fort, s, governor, who, refused, to, be, a, subordinate, subject, to, a, muslim, ruler, especially, a, border, emir, so, he, allied, himself, with, karacahisar, s, governor, and, both, men, agreed, to, fight, the, muslims, aiming, at, retaking, all, byzantine, lands, that, were, lost, recently, thus, the, ottomans, and, the, byzantines, met, again, in, battle, somewhere, between, bilecik, and, neg, l, where, fierce, fighting, took, place, in, which, osman, s, brother, savc, bey, and, the, byzantine, commander, pilatos, were, killed, the, battle, ended, with, an, ottoman, victory, then, the, ottomans, entered, karacahisar, where, they, reportedly, for, the, first, time, converted, the, town, s, church, into, a, mosque, osman, appointed, a, qadi, magistrate, and, a, suba, chief, of, police, for, the, newly, conquered, city, historians, differed, in, determining, the, date, of, this, conquest, yet, none, made, it, prior, to, 1286, or, exceeding, 1291, osman, made, his, new, city, a, staging, base, of, his, military, campaigns, against, the, byzantines, and, ordered, that, his, name, be, delivered, at, the, friday, khu, bah, which, was, the, first, manifestation, of, his, sovereignty, and, authority, osman, s, latest, victory, was, his, greatest, up, to, that, date, seljuk, sultan, al, eddin, kayqubad, iii, expressed, his, deep, appreciation, for, osman, s, accomplishments, in, the, name, of, the, seljuks, and, islam, giving, him, the, title, of, a, rat, uthm, n, gh, z, marzub, n, li, j, h, uthm, n, sh, h, the, honourable, conqueror, and, border, guardian, osman, sh, h, the, sultan, also, bestowed, upon, osman, the, governance, of, all, the, land, he, did, conquered, as, well, as, the, towns, of, eski, ehir, and, n, n, moreover, the, seljuk, sultan, issued, a, decree, exempting, osman, from, all, types, of, taxes, osman, also, received, several, gifts, from, the, sultan, reflecting, the, new, high, stature, to, the, seljuk, court, these, gifts, included, a, golden, war, banner, a, mehter, war, drum, a, tu, a, pole, with, circularly, arranged, horse, tail, hairs, a, tassel, a, gilded, sword, a, loose, saddle, and, one, hundred, thousand, dirhams, the, decree, also, included, the, recognition, of, osman, s, right, to, be, mentioned, in, the, friday, khu, bah, in, all, areas, subject, to, him, and, was, permitted, to, mint, coins, in, his, name, thus, osman, became, a, sultan, but, lacking, only, the, title, it, is, narrated, that, when, drums, were, beaten, announcing, sultan, s, kayqubad, s, arrival, osman, stood, up, in, glorification, and, remained, so, till, the, music, halted, since, that, day, ottoman, soldiers, enacted, standing, in, glorification, for, their, sultan, whenever, drums, were, beaten, soon, after, the, conquest, of, karacahisar, osman, marched, with, his, soldiers, north, towards, sakarya, river, upon, his, arrival, there, he, raided, and, looted, the, forts, of, g, yn, k, and, yenice, tarakl, many, argue, that, during, this, time, osman, received, a, message, from, his, byzantine, friend, k, se, mihal, warning, him, of, a, secret, conspiracy, that, was, being, prepared, by, the, tekfurs, of, bilecik, and, yarhisar, the, two, were, aiming, at, killing, osman, after, inviting, him, to, attend, their, children, s, wedding, osman, was, disappointed, by, being, betrayed, by, bilecik, s, tekfur, that, is, because, he, considered, the, relationship, with, bilecik, to, have, been, built, on, trust, and, good, faith, as, demonstrated, by, the, aforementioned, custom, of, his, clan, leaving, their, belongings, in, this, fortress, whenever, they, moved, between, grazing, areas, osman, devised, a, plan, to, escape, the, trap, and, take, over, the, fortress, he, sent, forty, of, his, soldiers, carrying, some, of, the, clan, s, belongings, to, be, kept, in, bilecik, while, most, of, its, inhabitants, were, outside, attending, the, wedding, once, his, men, entered, the, fort, they, quickly, overpowered, its, small, garrison, and, it, fell, to, the, ottomans, then, osman, went, to, the, feast, followed, by, some, byzantine, knights, who, were, easily, ambushed, by, his, men, later, a, short, battle, took, place, in, which, osman, was, victorious, and, most, of, the, byzantines, were, killed, after, that, osman, rode, towards, yarhisar, and, took, it, by, surprise, a, large, part, of, the, fort, s, garrison, was, killed, while, the, rest, were, taken, prisoners, the, tekfur, s, daughter, holophira, was, also, captured, in, this, action, she, soon, became, osman, s, daughter, in, law, having, married, his, son, orhan, sometime, later, and, her, name, was, changed, in, bayalun, afterwards, osman, and, several, of, his, men, took, over, all, towns, and, villages, surrounding, neg, l, before, laying, siege, on, the, fort, itself, and, taking, it, with, ease, osman, ordered, the, execution, of, neg, l, s, tekfur, since, he, was, known, for, persecuting, his, muslim, neighbours, then, placed, a, new, garrison, for, the, town, and, distributed, the, loot, among, his, men, osman, aspired, after, his, multiple, victories, to, expand, on, two, axes, aiming, to, isolate, the, byzantine, cities, he, was, looking, to, conquer, first, he, blocked, the, road, leading, to, znik, from, the, eastern, side, then, he, advanced, from, the, west, towards, lopadion, and, evrenos, after, that, osman, turned, around, mount, uluda, from, both, north, and, south, avoiding, the, fortified, city, of, bursa, connecting, with, his, muslim, neighbours, in, the, southeast, during, that, time, the, byzantine, empire, was, preoccupied, with, ongoing, clashes, with, its, powerful, enemies, in, anatolia, such, as, the, germiyanids, and, the, coastal, beyliks, not, to, mention, suppressing, unrest, and, discord, in, constantinople, and, the, balkans, the, empire, was, unable, to, face, osman, s, threats, thus, he, felt, free, to, expand, at, the, byzantines, expense, exploiting, the, current, situation, at, the, same, time, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, r, m, was, seeing, its, final, days, the, sultanate, grip, was, slowly, weakened, over, its, turkoman, beyliks, sultan, al, eddin, kayqubad, iii, became, deeply, unpopular, after, he, purged, the, seljuk, administration, of, his, predecessor, s, men, with, extreme, violence, this, prompted, the, mongol, ilkhan, mahmud, ghazan, to, call, upon, kayqubad, to, appear, before, him, and, once, the, latter, did, in, 1302, he, was, executed, and, replaced, with, his, predecessor, ghiy, th, ad, d, n, mas, d, bin, kayk, w, s, to, keep, the, peace, in, anatolia, according, to, another, account, mongol, and, tatar, hordes, raided, asia, minor, in, 1300, and, killed, sultan, kayqubad, in, his, capital, konya, it, was, also, said, that, kayk, w, s, himself, killed, his, rival, coveting, his, own, return, on, the, throne, another, story, suggests, that, kayqubad, escaped, and, sought, refuge, in, the, byzantine, court, where, he, remained, until, his, death, in, all, cases, kayk, w, s, s, rule, was, short, lived, lasting, between, 4, and, 6, years, at, most, and, when, he, died, in, 1308, ce, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, r, m, was, no, more, to, be, mentioned, in, the, historical, records, giving, the, way, for, the, turkoman, beyliks, to, emerge, as, independent, states, the, demise, of, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, r, m, gave, osman, autonomy, over, his, dominion, he, soon, dubbed, himself, padi, ah, l, osm, n, sovereign, of, the, house, of, osman, after, that, osman, set, his, sights, towards, conquering, the, last, of, the, byzantine, cities, towns, and, fortresses, in, anatolia, according, to, one, account, after, sultan, al, eddin, kayqubad, iii, was, killed, by, the, mongols, viziers, and, notable, leaders, met, and, decided, that, since, the, late, sultan, had, no, offspring, one, of, the, local, emirs, should, take, his, place, and, they, found, osman, perfect, fitting, the, candidacy, thus, the, leaders, offered, the, emir, the, position, and, osman, accepted, becoming, a, sultan, it, is, likely, that, kayqubad, s, and, kayk, w, s, s, deaths, led, to, the, sultanate, of, r, m, falling, into, chaos, and, prompted, many, of, its, regular, soldiers, to, join, the, armies, of, local, emirs, including, osman, this, gave, the, latter, a, great, momentum, and, important, military, experience, enriching, his, army, for, the, upcoming, conquests, soon, after, osman, secured, his, independence, and, established, control, over, all, fortresses, he, conquered, he, sent, messages, to, all, remaining, byzantine, tekfurs, in, anatolia, asking, them, to, choose, between, accepting, islam, ottoman, sovereignty, and, paying, jizyah, or, war, some, of, these, tekfurs, ended, up, accepting, islam, including, osman, s, old, friend, k, se, mihal, who, became, the, turkic, leader, s, companion, and, would, play, a, considerable, part, in, the, upcoming, expansions, of, the, osmanic, beylik, his, descendants, became, known, in, ottoman, history, as, mihalo, ullar, children, of, michael, plural, of, mihalo, lu, other, governors, acknowledged, osman, s, sovereignty, while, the, rest, kept, their, loyalty, to, the, byzantine, emperor, thus, osman, started, harassing, their, fortresses, such, as, bursa, and, nicaea, which, was, besieged, in, 1301, the, ottoman, raids, also, threatened, the, port, city, of, nicomedia, with, famine, as, the, ottomans, roamed, the, countryside, prohibiting, peasants, from, harvesting, wheat, this, provoked, bursa, s, tekfur, among, others, to, unite, their, efforts, to, eliminate, this, new, emerging, islamic, power, in, the, spring, of, 1302, emperor, michael, ix, launched, a, campaign, that, reached, south, to, magnesia, the, ottomans, awed, by, his, large, army, avoided, an, open, battle, the, emperor, sought, to, confront, the, ottomans, but, he, was, dissuaded, by, his, generals, encouraged, by, that, the, ottomans, resumed, their, raids, virtually, isolating, the, emperor, at, magnesia, soon, the, imperial, army, started, dissolving, without, engaging, in, a, single, battle, that, is, because, the, local, troops, left, to, defend, their, homes, which, were, continuously, raided, by, the, ottomans, and, the, alan, mercenaries, left, as, well, aiming, to, rejoin, with, their, families, in, thrace, the, byzantine, emperor, was, forced, to, withdraw, by, the, sea, followed, by, a, wave, of, refugees, to, counter, the, threat, to, nicomedia, michael, s, father, andronikos, ii, sent, a, byzantine, force, of, some, 2, 000, men, half, of, whom, were, recently, hired, alan, mercenaries, under, the, megas, hetaireiarches, giorgios, mouzalon, to, cross, the, bosporus, and, relieve, the, city, the, byzantine, response, was, a, warning, for, the, islamic, border, villages, and, towns, however, when, the, locals, noticed, osman, s, leadership, and, military, strength, as, well, as, his, devotion, to, islam, they, rallied, to, support, and, stand, with, him, to, consolidate, a, new, islamic, state, that, would, unite, them, and, form, an, impenetrable, wall, against, the, byzantines, several, byzantine, deserters, joined, osman, as, well, some, of, which, were, liberated, prisoners, of, war, who, chose, to, align, with, him, reportedly, due, to, his, good, treatment, during, their, custody, many, islamic, warrior, brotherhoods, also, joined, the, ottomans, for, example, the, gazi, r, m, s, raiders, of, the, romans, they, were, stationed, on, the, borders, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, repelled, its, attacks, on, muslim, lands, since, the, abbasid, era, gaining, great, experiences, and, knowledge, in, byzantine, strategies, and, tactics, another, example, is, the, ajjian, r, m, s, pilgrims, of, the, romans, a, brotherhood, of, muslim, clergy, concerned, with, teaching, local, villagers, and, recent, converts, the, basics, and, different, aspects, of, islam, and, had, a, side, objective, of, assisting, the, mujahideen, in, combat, the, byzantine, and, ottoman, armies, eventually, met, on, 27, july, 1302, at, the, plain, of, bapheus, located, between, nicomedia, and, nicaea, the, ottoman, army, consisted, of, light, cavalry, under, osman, himself, and, they, numbered, around, 5, 000, while, the, byzantines, numbered, around, 2, 000, men, the, muslim, cavalry, charged, toward, the, byzantines, fast, whose, alan, contingent, did, not, participate, in, the, battle, as, a, result, of, the, attack, the, byzantine, line, was, broken, forcing, giorgios, mouzalon, to, withdraw, into, nicomedia, under, the, cover, of, the, alan, force, bapheus, was, the, first, major, victory, for, the, nascent, osmanic, beylik, and, of, major, significance, for, its, future, expansion, the, byzantines, effectively, lost, control, of, the, countryside, of, bithynia, withdrawing, to, their, forts, which, became, isolated, and, fell, one, by, one, eventually, the, byzantine, defeat, also, sparked, a, mass, exodus, of, the, christian, population, from, the, area, into, the, european, parts, of, the, empire, further, altering, the, region, s, demographic, balance, coupled, with, the, defeat, at, magnesia, the, ottomans, were, able, to, reach, the, coasts, of, the, aegean, sea, threatening, byzantium, with, a, final, loss, for, their, territory, in, asia, minor, according, to, halil, nalc, k, the, battle, allowed, the, ottomans, to, achieve, the, characteristics, and, qualities, of, a, true, state, after, the, victory, in, bapheus, osman, divided, the, conquered, lands, among, his, kin, and, army, leaders, establishing, islamic, hegemony, and, ending, the, byzantine, era, in, his, new, areas, he, gave, eski, ehir, to, his, brother, g, nd, z, bey, karacahisar, to, his, son, orhan, yarhisar, to, hasan, alp, and, neg, l, to, turgut, alp, by, that, time, emperor, andronikos, ii, felt, the, pressure, of, the, ottoman, expansion, the, emperor, watched, in, fear, how, the, demographic, changes, were, rapidly, taking, place, in, anatolia, and, he, decided, to, stop, it, yet, being, recently, defeated, andronikos, ii, couldn, t, face, the, ottomans, in, an, open, battle, to, add, insult, to, injury, for, the, byzantine, conflicts, were, taking, place, in, the, balkans, thus, andronikos, ii, had, no, choice, but, to, try, making, an, alliance, with, the, mongols, in, persia, who, were, controlling, central, and, eastern, anatolia, to, achieve, that, the, emperor, sent, a, letter, to, ilkhan, mahmud, ghazan, offering, him, a, family, rapprochement, through, marriage, and, establishing, an, alliance, between, both, empires, at, that, time, the, mongols, were, passing, through, a, period, of, high, tension, with, the, mamluks, in, egypt, and, syria, this, did, overwhelm, the, relations, with, the, byzantines, especially, that, ghazan, was, preparing, for, another, campaign, to, damascus, and, palestine, after, his, first, invasion, in, 1299, ce, in, which, many, civilians, were, massacred, and, where, the, mamluk, army, suffered, a, massive, defeat, at, the, battle, of, wadi, al, khaznadar, near, im, the, mamluks, themselves, were, preparing, for, the, upcoming, war, with, the, mongols, aiming, to, wash, away, the, shame, of, their, previous, defeat, as, a, result, on, 20, april, 1303, the, mongols, and, mamluks, engaged, in, a, fierce, battle, on, the, outskirts, of, damascus, known, as, the, battle, of, shaqhab, or, battle, of, marj, al, saffar, in, which, the, mamluks, won, a, decisive, victory, this, devastating, defeat, had, a, heavy, toll, on, ghazan, and, seems, to, have, contributed, to, deteriorating, his, health, further, more, until, he, died, in, qazvin, on, sunday, 17, may, 1304, this, eliminated, any, hope, of, a, byzantine, mongol, alliance, and, allowed, the, ottomans, to, continue, on, with, their, conquests, after, ghazan, s, death, the, byzantine, emperor, was, forced, to, seek, other, solutions, to, the, problem, of, ottoman, expansion, thus, he, hired, a, company, of, catalan, mercenaries, led, by, roger, de, flor, the, mercenaries, had, become, unemployed, after, the, signing, of, the, peace, of, caltabellotta, between, the, crown, of, aragon, and, the, french, dynasty, of, the, angevins, in, 1302, the, company, arrived, at, constantinople, in, january, 1303, where, they, were, received, by, the, emperor, himself, then, the, mercenaries, were, housed, in, the, district, of, blachernae, the, emperor, arranged, the, wedding, of, roger, de, flor, to, his, niece, the, 15, year, old, princess, maria, asanina, daughter, of, the, tsar, of, bulgaria, ivan, asen, iii, and, irene, palaiologina, de, flor, was, named, megas, doux, great, dux, i, e, commander, of, the, imperial, forces, and, was, promised, a, four, months, payment, for, him, and, his, men, the, catalans, soon, crossed, to, asia, minor, and, fought, against, the, karasids, and, germiyanids, winning, a, fast, victory, afterward, they, resolved, to, attack, the, maritime, provinces, of, the, ottomans, and, moved, to, the, town, of, philadelphia, which, was, besieged, by, yakup, i, of, germiyan, who, suffered, a, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, catalans, and, was, forced, to, lift, his, siege, and, retreat, this, victory, proved, that, had, byzantium, been, able, to, gather, sufficient, military, forces, and, material, capabilities, it, would, have, been, able, to, eliminate, the, emerging, turkic, power, but, it, had, neither, it, was, not, long, before, the, catalans, abandoned, fighting, the, muslims, and, turned, their, attention, towards, the, byzantines, themselves, the, reason, for, that, was, that, the, local, population, of, magnesia, beheaded, the, catalan, garrison, and, stole, its, treasure, which, infuriated, roger, de, flor, and, made, him, march, towards, that, city, intending, on, revenge, the, byzantines, were, horrified, by, the, mercenaries, attacks, and, became, preoccupied, in, defending, themselves, roger, de, flor, was, soon, killed, by, order, of, the, emperor, s, son, michael, ix, who, saw, the, indiscipline, of, the, catalan, mercenaries, as, a, growing, danger, as, did, the, people, of, constantinople, who, rose, up, against, the, catalans, and, killed, many, of, them, once, the, news, reached, the, main, catalan, force, in, gallipoli, they, went, on, a, killing, spree, of, their, own, killing, all, the, local, byzantines, soon, after, this, the, byzantines, and, the, catalans, were, at, war, with, each, other, giving, way, to, osman, to, move, on, with, his, conquests, after, securing, his, northern, borders, by, reaching, the, black, and, marmara, seas, osman, turned, his, attention, towards, the, southern, borders, of, his, beylik, thus, he, attacked, the, byzantine, towns, villages, and, fortresses, surrounding, the, city, of, yeni, ehir, preparing, to, conquer, it, osman, sent, a, large, campaign, to, the, fortress, of, y, vandhisar, and, annexed, it, then, he, attacked, yeni, ehir, took, it, with, ease, and, made, it, his, temporary, capital, after, fortifying, and, strengthening, its, defenses, soon, after, that, osman, started, sending, more, campaigns, against, the, remaining, byzantine, cities, conquering, several, fortresses, including, lefke, akhisar, ko, hisar, yenicehisar, marmarac, k, and, k, pr, hisar, in, fact, conquering, the, aforementioned, forts, aimed, at, imposing, a, security, belt, around, yeni, ehir, thus, osman, surrounded, it, with, a, series, of, front, forts, to, ward, off, any, invasions, with, yeni, ehir, in, hands, osman, focused, his, efforts, on, isolated, large, cities, starting, with, bursa, unaware, that, this, would, be, his, last, campaign, he, gave, the, orders, to, start, building, two, forts, overseeing, and, surrounding, the, city, then, when, the, construction, was, completed, osman, provided, the, forts, with, large, garrisons, this, allowed, his, men, to, tighten, the, blockade, and, prevent, any, provisions, reaching, bursa, the, ottoman, siege, lasted, between, six, and, nine, years, this, was, due, to, the, fact, that, the, ottomans, had, no, siege, engines, and, they, had, never, captured, a, large, fortified, city, before, during, the, long, siege, osman, and, some, of, his, military, commanders, conquered, the, smaller, byzantine, fortresses, on, the, vicinity, of, the, beylik, in, which, several, tekfurs, acknowledged, osman, s, sovereignty, and, became, among, his, subjects, some, of, them, accepting, islam, in, the, process, soon, after, that, osman, started, suffering, from, gout, and, couldn, t, accompany, his, men, in, any, more, campaigns, or, witness, the, siege, of, bursa, so, he, entrusted, his, son, orhan, to, complete, this, major, task, while, he, retired, in, his, capital, orhan, s, continued, the, siege, without, any, fighting, but, he, continued, isolating, bursa, from, its, surrounding, forts, conquering, mudanya, to, cut, off, the, city, s, connection, to, the, sea, he, also, captured, the, city, of, praenetos, on, the, southern, coast, of, zmit, changing, its, name, to, karam, rsel, after, the, muslim, leader, who, took, it, karam, rsel, bey, the, last, fort, to, fall, was, beyce, which, was, considered, bursa, s, key, as, it, overlooked, it, and, it, was, renamed, orhaneli, orhan, tightened, the, blockade, around, bursa, till, its, garrison, fell, into, despair, soon, the, byzantine, emperor, realized, that, the, fall, of, the, city, into, muslim, hands, was, inevitable, thus, he, made, a, difficult, decision, ordering, his, governor, to, evacuate, the, city, orhan, entered, bursa, on, 6, april, 1326, its, people, were, not, subjected, to, any, harm, after, they, recognized, ottoman, sovereignty, and, pledged, to, pay, jizyah, saroz, the, garrison, s, leader, surrendered, to, orhan, and, pledged, allegiance, to, his, father, osman, he, also, converted, to, islam, and, was, given, the, title, of, bey, out, of, respect, to, his, courage, and, patience, during, the, long, siege, according, to, some, sources, osman, died, just, before, the, fall, of, the, city, while, others, suggest, that, he, lived, long, enough, to, hear, about, the, victory, on, his, death, bed, due, to, the, scarcity, of, sources, about, his, life, very, little, is, known, about, osman, s, family, relations, according, to, certain, fifteenth, century, ottoman, writers, osman, was, descended, from, the, kay, branch, of, the, oghuz, turks, a, claim, which, later, became, part, of, the, official, ottoman, genealogy, and, was, eventually, enshrined, in, the, turkish, nationalist, historical, tradition, with, the, writings, of, m, f, k, pr, l, however, the, claim, to, kay, lineage, does, not, appear, in, the, earliest, extant, ottoman, genealogies, thus, many, scholars, of, the, early, ottomans, regard, it, as, a, later, fabrication, meant, to, shore, up, dynastic, legitimacy, with, regard, to, the, empire, s, turkish, rivals, in, anatolia, yaz, c, o, lu, ali, in, the, early, 15th, century, constructed, a, genealogy, for, osman, tracing, it, back, to, oghuz, khagan, the, mythical, ancestor, of, the, western, turks, through, the, eldest, grandson, of, his, eldest, son, thereby, lending, legitimacy, to, the, ottoman, sultans, claim, of, primacy, among, turkish, monarchs, it, is, very, difficult, for, historians, to, determine, what, is, factual, and, what, is, legendary, about, the, many, stories, the, ottomans, told, about, osman, and, his, exploits, and, the, ottoman, sources, do, not, always, agree, with, each, other, according, to, one, story, osman, had, an, uncle, named, d, ndar, with, whom, he, had, a, quarrel, early, in, his, career, osman, wished, to, attack, the, local, christian, lord, of, bilecik, while, d, ndar, opposed, it, arguing, that, they, already, had, enough, enemies, interpreting, this, as, a, challenge, to, his, leadership, position, osman, shot, and, killed, his, uncle, with, an, arrow, this, story, first, appears, in, ne, ri, s, work, but, is, missing, in, earlier, ottoman, historical, works, if, it, was, true, it, means, that, it, was, likely, covered, up, to, avoid, tarnishing, the, reputation, of, the, ottoman, dynasty, s, founder, with, the, murder, of, a, family, member, it, may, also, indicate, an, important, change, in, the, relationship, of, the, ottomans, with, their, neighbors, shifting, from, relatively, peaceful, accommodation, to, a, more, aggressive, policy, of, conquest, osman, i, had, two, known, consorts, who, were, both, his, legal, wives, and, some, unknown, concubines, osman, i, had, at, least, eight, sons, osman, i, had, at, least, one, daughter, ottoman, historiography, depicts, osman, as, a, semi, holy, person, it, is, known, that, among, the, turkoman, tribes, the, tribe, or, part, of, it, was, named, after, its, leader, the, fact, that, the, kayi, tribe, became, known, by, the, name, of, osman, suggests, that, the, tribe, became, powerful, because, of, his, excellent, leadership, orientalist, r, rakhmanaliev, writes, that, the, historical, role, of, osman, was, that, of, a, tribal, leader, who, enjoyed, enormous, success, in, uniting, his, people, around, him, the, activities, and, personality, of, osman, as, the, founder, of, the, state, and, dynasty, are, highly, appreciated, by, historians, of, both, the, past, and, the, present, the, state, and, the, dynasty, of, rulers, are, named, after, him, the, population, of, the, state, was, called, ottomans, osmanlilar, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, that, is, until, the, collapse, of, the, ottoman, empire, historian, f, uspensky, notes, that, osman, relied, not, only, on, force, but, also, cunningness, historian, and, writer, lord, kinross, writes, that, osman, was, a, wise, patient, ruler, whom, people, sincerely, respected, and, were, ready, to, serve, him, faithfully, he, had, a, natural, sense, of, superiority, but, he, never, sought, to, assert, himself, with, the, help, of, power, and, therefore, he, was, respected, not, only, by, those, who, were, equal, in, position, but, also, those, who, exceeded, his, abilities, on, the, battlefield, or, on, wisdom, osman, did, not, arouse, feelings, of, rivalry, in, his, people, only, loyalty, herbert, gibbons, believed, that, osman, was, great, enough, to, exploit, masterful, people, according, to, cemal, kafadar, osman, for, the, ottomans, was, the, same, as, romulus, for, the, romans, according, to, the, sources, that, say, osman, lived, to, hear, of, the, fall, of, bursa, orhan, rushed, back, to, s, t, to, inform, his, father, of, his, great, victory, once, he, reached, it, he, was, immediately, summoned, to, osman, who, was, on, his, death, bed, soon, after, osman, heard, the, news, he, died, from, natural, causes, however, osman, managed, to, name, orhan, to, be, his, successor, although, the, latter, was, not, osman, s, first, born, yet, the, dead, emir, believed, that, orhan, was, better, fit, to, rule, than, his, elder, half, brother, al, eddin, who, was, more, passive, and, pious, than, orhan, as, for, the, exact, cause, of, osman, s, death, it, is, well, known, that, he, suffered, from, gout, for, several, years, which, seemingly, caused, his, eventual, death, this, is, confirmed, by, what, a, kpa, azade, mentioned, in, tevarih, i, l, i, osman, when, he, talked, about, the, late, period, of, osman, s, life, saying, osman, had, a, bad, foot, from, which, he, experienced, severe, pain, it, is, noted, that, a, kpa, azade, used, a, similar, expression, when, he, talked, about, the, death, of, sultan, mehmed, the, conqueror, the, cause, of, his, death, was, the, issue, in, his, feet, it, is, now, known, that, gout, is, a, genetic, disease, in, the, ottoman, dynasty, and, many, sultans, suffered, from, it, the, exact, date, of, osman, s, death, is, debatable, it, is, said, that, he, died, on, 21, august, 1326, at, 70, years, old, the, 15th, century, ottoman, historian, rouhi, elebi, who, wrote, down, the, history, of, the, ottoman, empire, until, 1481, indicates, that, osman, died, in, 1320, however, uru, adilo, lu, another, ottoman, historian, who, lived, during, the, time, of, sultans, mehmed, the, conqueror, and, bayezid, ii, up, until, 1502, says, that, osman, died, in, 1327, contemporary, turkish, historian, necdet, sakao, lu, states, that, despite, the, absence, of, documents, mentioning, osman, s, name, after, the, year, 1320, there, are, documents, confirming, orhan, s, ascension, to, the, throne, in, 1324, based, on, this, osman, s, death, might, have, occurred, in, the, same, or, previous, year, it, is, also, certain, that, osman, s, death, was, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, law, sheikh, edebali, and, after, the, death, of, his, wife, rabia, bala, hatun, because, it, is, known, that, osman, buried, the, two, in, bilecik, once, osman, died, orhan, ordered, the, transfer, of, his, body, to, bursa, his, new, capital, thus, osman, s, body, was, laid, there, to, rest, his, grave, is, located, today, in, the, neighbourhood, of, tophane, the, reason, behind, the, transferring, osman, s, body, was, due, to, a, will, osman, did, tell, his, son, about, during, the, early, years, of, besieging, bursa, my, son, when, i, die, bury, me, under, that, silver, dome, in, bursa, however, osman, s, current, tomb, dates, back, to, the, time, of, sultan, abdulaziz, 1861, 1876, because, the, first, tomb, was, completely, destroyed, in, a, severe, earthquake, that, struck, the, region, in, 1855, it, was, rebuilt, by, the, aforementioned, sultan, sultan, abdulhamid, ii, 1876, 1909, also, constructed, a, shrine, in, s, t, where, osman, was, buried, for, a, while, before, he, was, moved, to, bursa, according, to, some, sources, osman, left, a, written, will, to, his, son, orhan, instructing, him, to, move, on, with, conquests, and, jihad, against, the, byzantines, that, he, abides, by, the, teachings, of, islam, accompany, the, ulam, amend, his, parish, and, dedicates, himself, to, spread, the, word, of, islam, osman, is, considered, the, founder, of, the, ottoman, dynasty, who, started, an, imperial, line, that, would, expand, to, include, 35, sultans, rulers, of, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, empires, in, world, history, the, ottoman, empire, lasted, until, 1918, when, it, disintegrated, after, defeat, alongside, other, central, powers, in, world, war, i, osman, is, often, referred, to, as, the, first, in, the, line, of, ottoman, sultans, although, he, himself, never, carried, this, title, in, his, life, and, was, instead, called, bey, or, emir, one, endowment, written, in, persian, and, dating, back, to, 1324, indicates, that, osman, was, given, the, titles, mu, iuddin, reviver, of, the, faith, and, fakhruddin, pride, of, the, faith, osman, s, descendants, are, distributed, today, in, several, american, european, and, arab, countries, after, the, royal, ottoman, family, was, expelled, from, turkey, in, 1924, shortly, after, the, declaration, of, the, republic, by, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, eventually, several, family, members, returned, to, turkey, after, the, turkish, government, allowed, the, females, to, return, in, 1951, however, male, descendants, had, to, wait, until, 1973, ce, to, be, able, to, enter, turkey, again, other, members, remained, in, the, countries, where, their, ancestors, had, sought, refuge, such, as, england, france, the, united, states, egypt, saudi, arabia, among, others, osman, s, descendants, are, known, today, as, the, osmano, lu, son, of, osman, family, the, sword, of, osman, turkish, taklid, i, seyf, was, an, important, sword, of, state, used, during, the, coronation, ceremony, of, the, ottoman,

osman, was, a, vital, ceremony, which, took, place, within, two, weeks, of, a, sultan, s, accession, to, the, throne, it, was, held, at, the, tomb, complex, at, ey, p, on, the, golden, horn, waterway, in, the, capital, constantinople, the, fact, that, the, emblem, by, which, a, sultan, was, enthroned, consisted, of, a, sword, was, highly, symbolic, it, showed, that, the, office, with, which, he, was, invested, was, first, and, foremost, that, of, a, warrior, the, sword, of, osman, was, girded, on, to, the, new, sultan, by, the, sharif, of, konya, a, mevlevi, dervish, who, was, summoned, to,
