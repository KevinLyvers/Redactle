professional, career, nicklaus, employed, angelo, argea, as, his, caddie, after, nicklaus, won, the, 1967, u, s, open, in, record, breaking, fashion, he, did, not, win, another, major, championship, until, the, 1970, open, championship, at, the, old, course, at, st, andrews, moreover, his, highest, finish, on, the, tour, money, list, for, the, years, 1968, 70, was, second, his, lowest, was, fourth, his, worst, ranking, on, the, list, since, turning, professional, however, his, fourth, place, ranking, in, 1970, would, have, been, elevated, to, second, if, the, open, championship, winnings, were, included, during, that, period, in, the, official, pga, tour, money, list, as, they, are, today, nicklaus, finished, runner, up, in, both, the, 1968, u, s, open, to, new, rival, lee, trevino, and, the, 1968, open, championship, to, old, rival, gary, player, nicklaus, made, his, inaugural, appearance, in, the, 1969, ryder, cup, at, age, 29, eligibility, rules, at, the, time, required, a, minimum, five, year, pga, tour, membership, before, points, could, be, counted, for, team, qualification, rules, have, been, relaxed, significantly, since, in, the, 1969, ryder, cup, the, entire, competition, came, down, to, the, anchor, singles, match, between, nicklaus, and, tony, jacklin, at, the, par, 5, 17th, hole, with, nicklaus, leading, by, the, score, of, 1, up, jacklin, made, a, 35, foot, 11, m, eagle, putt, to, square, the, match, with, the, entire, competition, outcome, riding, on, this, match, nicklaus, made, a, five, foot, par, putt, on, the, last, hole, before, controversially, conceding, jacklin, s, par, putt, ensuring, that, this, game, and, the, overall, match, ended, in, a, tie, afterwards, united, states, team, captain, sam, snead, said, this, is, the, greatest, golf, match, you, have, ever, seen, in, england, during, this, period, nicklaus, s, physical, condition, declined, somewhat, he, put, on, some, excess, weight, which, affected, his, stamina, following, the, ryder, cup, he, significantly, improved, his, condition, in, the, fall, of, 1969, by, losing, 25, pounds, 11, kg, in, one, month, and, his, game, started, to, return, to, top, form, in, february, 1970, nicklaus, s, father, charlie, nicklaus, died, of, pancreatic, cancer, at, age, 56, five, months, after, this, nicklaus, won, the, 1970, open, championship, under, difficult, scoring, conditions, in, scotland, where, the, wind, howled, up, to, 56, miles, per, hour, 90, km, h, defeating, fellow, american, doug, sanders, in, an, 18, hole, playoff, round, in, emotional, fashion, on, the, 18th, hole, of, the, playoff, nicklaus, drove, about, 380, yards, through, the, par, 4, green, with, a, three, wood, and, was, forced, to, pitch, back, to, the, hole, his, eagle, pitch, finished, approximately, eight, feet, short, of, the, hole, nicklaus, threw, his, putter, into, the, air, after, sinking, the, winning, putt, as, he, was, thrilled, to, have, won, the, open, at, the, home, of, golf, st, andrews, he, describes, this, period, in, his, life, i, was, playing, good, golf, but, it, really, wasn, t, that, big, a, deal, to, me, one, way, or, the, other, and, then, my, father, died, and, i, sort, of, realized, that, he, had, certainly, lived, his, life, through, my, golf, game, i, really, hadn, t, probably, given, him, the, best, of, that, so, i, sort, of, got, myself, back, to, work, so, 70, was, an, emotional, one, for, me, from, that, standpoint, it, was, a, big, boost, nicklaus, also, went, on, to, capture, the, piccadilly, world, match, play, championship, in, 1970, with, a, 2, 1, win, over, lee, trevino, in, the, championship, match, in, all, for, the, year, nicklaus, competed, in, 23, official, worldwide, events, won, four, placed, in, the, top, 5, 10, times, and, the, top, 10, in, 14, although, nicklaus, s, performance, had, declined, somewhat, during, this, period, he, was, still, ranked, as, the, no, 1, player, in, the, world, for, 10, straight, years, beginning, in, 1968, on, the, mccormack, s, world, golf, rankings, which, were, introduced, that, year, by, sports, agent, mark, mccormack, these, rankings, the, first, attempt, to, take, into, account, results, from, professional, tours, around, the, world, were, not, official, during, that, era, but, they, eventually, evolved, into, the, current, official, world, golf, ranking, starting, in, 1986, with, his, victory, in, the, 1971, pga, championship, nicklaus, became, the, first, golfer, to, win, all, four, majors, twice, in, this, championship, nicklaus, was, the, only, player, to, break, 70, consecutively, in, the, first, two, rounds, under, windy, conditions, he, finished, at, seven, under, par, 281, nicklaus, finished, second, twice, and, fifth, in, the, remaining, three, major, championships, for, the, year, while, he, finished, tied, for, second, in, the, masters, with, johnny, miller, nicklaus, made, a, big, enough, impression, on, a, young, nick, faldo, watching, on, tv, in, england, in, order, for, faldo, to, take, up, the, game, seriously, by, the, end, of, 1971, nicklaus, had, won, four, additional, pga, tournaments, including, the, tournament, of, champions, by, eight, shots, and, the, national, team, championship, with, arnold, palmer, by, six, shots, with, 244, 490, in, official, pga, tour, earnings, nicklaus, established, a, new, single, season, money, record, during, the, year, nicklaus, also, claimed, his, third, world, cup, individual, title, in, 1971, with, help, from, a, 63, in, the, third, round, he, also, won, the, team, competition, with, partner, lee, trevino, by, 12, shots, the, year, 1971, brought, nicklaus, a, victory, in, the, australian, dunlop, international, as, well, punctuated, by, a, course, record, 62, his, career, low, score, in, competition, one, of, three, in, the, second, round, for, the, record, nicklaus, played, in, 23, official, worldwide, events, in, 1971, won, eight, had, 17, top, 5, finishes, 20, top, 10, finishes, and, compiled, a, 5, 1, 0, record, in, that, year, s, ryder, cup, competition, nicklaus, won, the, first, two, major, championships, of, 1972, by, three, shots, each, in, wire, to, wire, fashion, he, won, the, masters, and, the, u, s, open, creating, talk, of, a, calendar, year, grand, slam, nicklaus, opened, with, a, four, under, par, 68, at, augusta, national, and, never, looked, back, he, was, the, only, player, under, par, for, the, week, as, he, and, the, field, battled, difficult, scoring, conditions, in, the, u, s, open, at, pebble, beach, again, under, severe, scoring, conditions, nicklaus, struck, a, one, iron, on, the, 218, yard, par, three, 17th, hole, during, the, final, round, into, a, stiff, gusty, ocean, breeze, that, hit, the, flagstick, and, ended, up, three, inches, from, the, cup, the, u, s, open, was, nicklaus, s, 13th, career, major, and, tied, him, with, bobby, jones, for, career, majors, although, a, different, group, of, tournaments, had, been, considered, majors, in, jones, s, time, this, victory, was, also, nicklaus, s, 11th, professional, major, tying, him, with, walter, hagen, and, made, him, the, first, player, to, win, the, u, s, amateur, and, u, s, open, championships, on, the, same, golf, course, during, the, 1972, pga, tour, season, nicklaus, won, seven, tournaments, and, was, runner, up, in, three, events, however, nicklaus, did, not, win, the, grand, slam, that, year, as, lee, trevino, repeated, as, the, open, championship, winner, nicklaus, finished, second, one, shot, behind, and, gary, player, prevailed, in, the, pga, championship, nicklaus, closed, out, this, remarkable, year, with, a, second, of, three, consecutive, walt, disney, world, golf, classic, victories, by, shooting, a, 21, under, par, 267, to, win, by, nine, shots, he, concluded, 1972, by, competing, in, 20, official, worldwide, events, winning, seven, placing, second, in, four, and, compiling, 15, top, 10, finishes, bobby, jones, s, record, of, majors, was, soon, broken, when, nicklaus, won, the, pga, championship, in, august, 1973, by, four, shots, over, bruce, crampton, for, his, 12th, professional, major, surpassing, hagen, s, mark, of, 11, and, 14th, overall, when, using, the, old, style, configuration, of, jones, s, day, in, that, year, he, won, another, six, tournaments, when, he, won, the, 1973, ohio, kings, island, open, he, became, the, first, pga, tour, player, to, win, a, tour, event, on, a, course, that, he, designed, himself, the, pga, player, of, the, year, was, awarded, to, nicklaus, for, the, third, time, and, the, second, year, in, a, row, nicklaus, was, also, the, first, player, to, win, over, 300, 000, 00, in, official, money, for, a, single, season, in, 1972, at, 320, 542, he, eclipsed, that, threshold, again, the, following, year, with, 308, 362, the, former, total, was, 106, 137, more, than, runner, up, lee, trevino, the, latter, total, for, the, year, 1973, catapulted, nicklaus, over, the, 2, million, career, pga, tour, earnings, mark, making, him, the, first, player, to, reach, that, milestone, nicklaus, teamed, with, johnny, miller, for, another, team, title, in, the, world, cup, of, golf, held, in, spain, for, the, year, nicklaus, competed, in, 20, official, worldwide, events, and, claimed, seven, victories, 14, top, five, finishes, 17, top, 10s, and, compiled, a, 4, 1, 1, record, in, that, year, s, ryder, cup, competition, nicklaus, s, failure, to, win, a, major, in, 1974, was, somewhat, offset, when, he, won, the, inaugural, tournament, players, championship, and, was, named, one, of, the, 13, original, inductees, into, the, world, golf, hall, of, fame, nicklaus, said, this, honor, was, a, nice, memento, after, a, disappointing, season, although, he, had, no, major, championship, victories, in, 1974, nicklaus, still, achieved, four, top, 10, finishes, in, the, four, events, three, of, which, were, in, the, top, four, and, placed, second, on, the, official, money, list, behind, johnny, miller, while, less, than, a, stellar, year, nicklaus, was, able, to, claim, two, victories, and, 13, top, 10, finishes, in, 20, official, worldwide, events, nicklaus, started, off, well, in, 1975, he, won, the, doral, eastern, open, the, sea, pines, heritage, classic, and, the, masters, in, consecutive, starts, his, masters, win, was, his, fifth, a, record, he, was, to, break, eleven, years, later, in, this, tournament, nicklaus, s, 40, foot, 12, m, birdie, putt, on, the, 16th, hole, of, the, final, round, was, a, key, in, his, victory, over, tom, weiskopf, and, johnny, miller, in, a, riveting, final, round, battle, he, also, won, the, pga, championship, in, august, at, firestone, country, club, by, two, shots, over, bruce, crampton, for, his, fourth, win, having, won, the, masters, and, pga, championship, nicklaus, missed, a, playoff, for, the, u, s, open, by, two, shots, and, a, playoff, for, open, championship, by, one, shot, his, performance, in, 1975, resulted, in, his, being, named, pga, player, of, the, year, for, the, fourth, time, tying, ben, hogan, and, he, was, also, named, abc, s, wide, world, of, sports, athlete, of, the, year, nicklaus, also, captured, his, fourth, australian, open, during, the, year, the, year, 1975, yielded, nicklaus, six, wins, 12, top, 5, finishes, and, 16, top, 10, finishes, in, 18, official, worldwide, events, nicklaus, placed, first, on, the, pga, tour, money, list, again, in, 1976, despite, competing, in, only, 16, events, winning, just, two, tournament, players, championship, and, world, series, of, golf, neither, of, them, majors, and, playing, what, he, called, hang, back, and, hope, golf, the, 1976, tournament, players, championship, saw, nicklaus, set, a, championship, record, of, 19, under, par, 269, for, his, second, win, in, this, event, which, remained, in, place, until, greg, norman, s, 24, under, par, 264, assault, in, 1994, he, also, won, the, pga, player, of, the, year, award, for, a, record, fifth, time, between, 1972, and, 1976, the, only, time, he, failed, to, win, this, award, was, 1974, the, year, 1976, also, concluded, an, official, streak, of, 105, consecutive, cuts, made, on, the, pga, tour, ending, at, the, world, open, which, began, for, nicklaus, in, 1970, at, the, time, this, streak, was, second, only, to, byron, nelson, s, record, of, 113, the, following, year, 1977, was, also, majorless, for, nicklaus, but, he, did, achieve, four, top, 10, finishes, in, the, four, events, inclusive, of, two, second, and, one, third, place, finish, this, being, one, shot, out, of, the, pga, championship, playoff, between, lanny, wadkins, and, gene, littler, despite, a, brilliant, final, round, 66, at, the, masters, he, finished, second, by, two, shots, to, tom, watson, but, his, subsequent, second, place, finish, behind, watson, at, the, open, championship, at, turnberry, created, headlines, around, the, world, in, a, one, on, one, battle, dubbed, the, duel, in, the, sun, nicklaus, shot, 65, 66, in, the, final, two, rounds, only, to, be, beaten, by, watson, who, scored, 65, 65, this, event, marked, the, first, time, 270, was, broken, in, a, major, championship, and, the, third, place, finisher, hubert, green, scored, 279, nicklaus, would, later, say, there, are, those, in, golf, who, would, argue, into, next, month, that, the, final, two, rounds, of, the, 1977, british, open, were, the, greatest, head, to, head, golf, match, ever, played, not, having, been, around, for, the, first, five, hundred, or, so, years, of, the, game, i, m, not, qualified, to, speak, on, such, matters, what, s, for, sure, however, is, that, it, was, the, most, thrilling, one, on, one, battle, of, my, career, in, 1977, nicklaus, won, his, 63rd, tour, event, passing, ben, hogan, to, take, second, place, on, the, career, wins, list, behind, only, sam, snead, subsequently, hogan, s, official, career, pga, tour, victory, total, was, put, at, 64, including, his, 1953, open, championship, which, was, retroactively, deemed, an, official, pga, tour, event, he, also, became, the, first, player, to, amass, over, 3, million, in, official, pga, tour, earnings, the, year, also, saw, nicklaus, win, for, the, first, time, his, own, memorial, tournament, where, he, described, the, victory, as, the, most, emotional, moment, of, his, entire, career, and, nearly, decided, to, retire, from, competitive, golf, during, the, 1977, ryder, cup, at, royal, lytham, st, annes, nicklaus, approached, the, pga, of, great, britain, about, the, urgency, to, improve, the, competitive, level, of, the, contest, the, issue, had, been, discussed, earlier, the, same, day, by, both, past, pga, of, america, president, henry, poe, and, british, pga, president, lord, derby, nicklaus, pitched, his, ideas, adding, it, is, vital, to, widen, the, selection, procedures, if, the, ryder, cup, is, to, continue, to, enjoy, its, past, prestige, the, changes, in, team, selection, procedure, were, approved, by, descendants, of, the, samuel, ryder, family, along, with, the, pga, of, america, the, major, change, was, expanding, selection, procedures, to, include, players, from, the, european, tournament, players, division, and, that, european, members, be, entitled, to, play, on, the, team, this, meant, that, professional, players, on, the, european, tournament, players, division, the, forerunner, to, the, european, tour, we, have, today, from, continental, europe, would, be, eligible, to, play, in, the, ryder, cup, when, nicklaus, won, the, 1978, open, championship, at, st, andrews, he, became, the, only, player, to, win, each, major, championship, three, times, this, record, was, tied, by, tiger, woods, when, he, won, the, 2008, u, s, open, nicklaus, and, woods, are, the, only, two, players, to, win, three, career, grand, slams, nicklaus, considered, his, performance, in, the, 1978, open, as, the, finest, four, days, of, tee, to, green, golf, he, had, ever, produced, and, was, most, proud, that, the, win, came, at, st, andrews, his, favorite, place, to, play, golf, the, victory, was, also, his, most, emotional, to, date, nicklaus, won, three, other, tournaments, on, the, pga, tour, in, 1978, one, of, those, wins, came, in, the, jackie, gleason, inverrary, classic, where, he, played, the, final, 36, holes, 13, under, par, and, scored, five, consecutive, birdies, over, the, closing, holes, in, the, final, round, he, also, won, his, third, tournament, players, championship, in, difficult, weather, conditions, he, had, won, three, of, the, first, five, stagings, of, that, tournament, and, he, remains, the, championship, s, only, three, time, winner, he, was, named, sportsman, of, the, year, by, sports, illustrated, the, year, 1978, also, marked, nicklaus, s, sixth, and, final, australian, open, victory, in, 1979, nicklaus, suffered, a, lapse, of, form, and, did, not, win, a, tournament, this, was, the, first, year, in, his, professional, career, in, which, he, failed, to, win, a, pga, tour, event, he, had, only, one, runner, up, finish, plus, a, tied, for, second, with, ben, crenshaw, behind, 22, year, old, seve, ballesteros, at, the, open, championship, he, would, not, win, another, tournament, until, june, 1980, previously, nicklaus, won, at, least, one, pga, tour, tournament, per, year, a, record, he, shares, with, arnold, palmer, and, a, minimum, of, two, tournaments, per, year, for, 17, consecutive, years, and, this, is, another, pga, tour, record, during, the, offseason, nicklaus, addressed, two, problems, that, had, hurt, his, performance, his, lifelong, teacher, jack, grout, noticed, that, he, had, become, much, too, upright, with, his, full, swing, which, caused, a, steep, oblique, approach, into, the, ball, compared, with, a, more, direct, hit, this, was, corrected, by, slightly, flattening, his, backswing, then, nicklaus, s, short, game, never, a, career, strength, was, further, developed, with, the, help, of, phil, rodgers, a, friend, for, more, than, 20, years, and, earlier, pga, tour, rival, who, had, become, a, fine, coach, rodgers, lived, for, a, time, at, the, nicklaus, home, while, this, work, was, going, on, in, 1980, nicklaus, recorded, only, four, top, 10, finishes, in, 14, events, but, two, of, these, were, record, setting, victories, in, majors, the, u, s, open, and, the, pga, championship, the, other, two, were, a, tie, for, fourth, in, the, open, championship, and, a, runner, up, finish, in, the, doral, eastern, open, to, raymond, floyd, via, his, chip, in, birdie, on, the, second, hole, of, a, sudden, death, playoff, nicklaus, set, a, new, scoring, record, for, the, 1980, u, s, open, with, an, aggregate, of, 272, eclipsing, his, earlier, record, of, 275, from, 1967, over, the, same, golf, course, that, record, while, since, having, been, tied, by, three, other, players, stood, until, rory, mcilroy, s, 268, in, winning, the, 2011, u, s, open, this, was, nicklaus, s, second, major, win, at, baltusrol, golf, club, nicklaus, opened, with, a, record, tying, 63, in, round, one, and, fought, off, his, playing, partner, of, all, four, rounds, 1978, colgate, world, match, play, championship, winner, isao, aoki, entering, the, final, round, aoki, had, caught, nicklaus, after, three, consecutive, rounds, of, 68, but, over, the, course, of, the, last, day, nicklaus, pulled, away, by, two, shots, each, player, birdied, the, final, two, holes, for, a, dramatic, finish, aoki, s, aggregate, of, 274, was, the, lowest, score, for, a, u, s, open, runner, up, nicklaus, s, win, was, his, fourth, and, final, victory, in, the, championship, tying, him, with, willie, anderson, bobby, jones, and, ben, hogan, nicklaus, referred, to, this, win, as, by, far, the, most, emotional, and, warmest, reaction, to, any, of, my, wins, in, my, own, country, in, the, 1980, pga, championship, nicklaus, set, another, record, when, he, won, the, tournament, by, seven, shots, over, andy, bean, at, the, oak, hill, country, club, the, win, was, largely, due, to, exceptional, putting, nicklaus, shot, an, even, par, 70, in, the, first, round, this, was, followed, by, three, successive, rounds, in, the, 60s, over, the, difficult, course, and, he, was, the, only, player, to, break, par, for, 72, holes, for, the, week, the, field, averaged, 74, 60, strokes, while, nicklaus, averaged, 68, 50, this, was, nicklaus, s, fifth, and, final, victory, in, the, pga, championship, which, elevated, him, to, record, holder, for, the, most, wins, in, the, stroke, play, era, and, which, tied, him, with, walter, hagen, for, the, most, wins, overall, since, hagen, s, victories, were, all, during, the, match, play, era, nicklaus, s, seven, shot, winning, margin, remained, the, largest, for, the, stroke, play, version, of, the, championship, until, rory, mcilroy, s, 2012, victory, this, victory, also, made, nicklaus, the, only, player, since, gene, sarazen, in, 1922, and, ben, hogan, in, 1948, to, win, the, u, s, open, and, pga, championship, the, same, year, subsequently, equaled, by, tiger, woods, in, 2000, and, brooks, koepka, in, 2018, between, 1981, and, 1985, nicklaus, accumulated, seven, more, top, 10, placements, in, major, championships, including, three, runner, up, performances,

miller, during, the, five, year, period, between, 1981, and, 1985, the, ryder, cup, matches, provided, nicklaus, with, two, bright, spots, he, completed, his, competition, as, a, player, in, style, by, contributing, a, perfect, 4, 0, 0, record, inclusive, of, a, 5, 3, anchor, singles, match, win, over, eamonn, darcy, in, 1981, and, captained, the, united, states, team, in, 1983, to, a, one,

became, the, oldest, masters, winner, in, history, a, record, that, still, stands, on, the, feat, sports, columnist, thomas, boswell, remarked, some, things, cannot, possibly, happen, because, they, are, both, too, improbable, and, too, perfect, the, u, s, hockey, team, cannot, beat, the, russians, in, the, 1980, olympics, jack, nicklaus, cannot, shoot, 65, to, win, the, masters, at, age, 46,

described, at, the, time, by, noted, golf, historian, and, writer, herbert, warren, wind, as, nothing, less, than, the, most, important, accomplishment, in, golf, since, bobby, jones, s, grand, slam, in, 1930, author, ken, bowden, wrote, after, the, win, there, have, been, prettier, swingers, of, the, club, than, jack, nicklaus, there, may, have, been, better, ball, strikers, than, jack, nicklaus,

fiercely, competitive, as, jack, nicklaus, but, no, individual, has, been, able, to, develop, combine, and, sustain, all, of, the, complex, physical, skills, and, the, immense, mental, and, emotional,

asset, especially, under, pressure, which, allowed, him, to, obtain, great, distance, control, with, his, irons, nicklaus, was, also, known, for, his, course, management, skills, he, would, plan, to, hit, each, full, shot, to, the, optimal, position, to, best, set, up, his, next, shot, usually, aiming, for, level, lies, and, clear, approach, lines, while, favoring, his, preferred, shot, shapes, he, would, often, hold, back, on, power, to, achieve, this, but, had, a, power, advantage, over, most, rivals, through, the, set, so, that, he, could, hit, a, 3, wood, or, 1, iron, from, the, tee, with, increased, accuracy, to, avoid, trouble, with, sufficient, length, to, keep, up, with, the, drivers, hit, by, most, rivals, an, exceptional, example, of, this, came, in, the, final, round, of, the, 1966, open, championship, at, muirfield, on, the, 17th, hole, a, 530, yard, par, 5, hole, nicklaus, needed, a, birdie, but, the, hole, was, framed, by, tall, fescue, rough, and, was, playing,

nicklaus, had, the, greatest, mind, the, game, has, ever, known, nicklaus, was, not, known, for, being, an, outstanding, putter, but, he, was, often, able, to, make, the, important, putts, when, they, were, needed, nicklaus, s, putting, was, highly, regarded, by, his, rivals, he, was, also, known, as, a, conservative, player, at, times, he, went, for, broke, only, when, it, was, necessary, this, was, especially, apparent, on, the, greens, where, he, would, often, choose, to, be, less, aggressive, and, make, sure, of, an, easy, two, putt, nicklaus, spoke, about, this, in, his, autobiography, i, was, a, fine, two, putter, but, sometimes, too, defensive, too, concerned, about, three, putting, to, go, for, putts, that, i, probably, should, have, gone, for, after, nicklaus, s, first, year,
