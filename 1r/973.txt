islamic, doctrine, he, was, a, prophet, divinely, inspired, to, preach, and, confirm, the, monotheistic, teachings, of, adam, abraham, moses, jesus, and, other, prophets, he, is, believed, to, be, the, seal, of, the, prophets, within, islam, with, the, quran, as, well, as, his, teachings, and, practices, forming, the, basis, for, islamic, religious, belief, muhammad, was, born, in, approximately, 570, ce, in, mecca, he, was, the, son, of, abdullah, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, and, amina, bint, wahb, his, father, abdullah, the, son, of, quraysh, tribal, leader, abd, al, muttalib, ibn, hashim, died, around, the, time, muhammad, was, born, his, mother, amina, died, when, he, was, six, leaving, muhammad, an, orphan, he, was, raised, under, the, care, of, his, grandfather, abd, al, muttalib, and, paternal, uncle, abu, talib, in, later, years, he, would, periodically, seclude, himself, in, a, mountain, cave, named, hira, for, several, nights, of, prayer, when, he, was, 40, circa, 610, ce, muhammad, reported, being, visited, by, gabriel, in, the, cave, and, receiving, his, first, revelation, from, god, in, 613, muhammad, started, preaching, these, revelations, publicly, proclaiming, that, god, is, one, that, complete, submission, isl, m, to, god, allah, is, the, right, way, of, life, d, n, and, that, he, was, a, prophet, and, messenger, of, god, similar, to, the, other, prophets, in, islam, muhammad, s, followers, were, initially, few, in, number, and, experienced, hostility, from, meccan, polytheists, for, 13, years, to, escape, ongoing, persecution, he, sent, some, of, his, followers, to, abyssinia, in, 615, before, he, and, his, followers, migrated, from, mecca, to, medina, then, known, as, yathrib, later, in, 622, this, event, the, hijrah, marks, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, calendar, also, known, as, the, hijri, calendar, in, medina, muhammad, united, the, tribes, under, the, constitution, of, medina, in, december, 629, after, eight, years, of, intermittent, fighting, with, meccan, tribes, muhammad, gathered, an, army, of, 10, 000, muslim, converts, and, marched, on, the, city, of, mecca, the, conquest, went, largely, uncontested, and, muhammad, seized, the, city, with, minimal, casualties, in, 632, a, few, months, after, returning, from, the, farewell, pilgrimage, he, fell, ill, and, died, by, the, time, of, his, death, most, of, the, arabian, peninsula, had, converted, to, islam, the, revelations, ayat, that, muhammad, reported, receiving, until, his, death, form, the, verses, of, the, quran, regarded, by, muslims, as, the, verbatim, word, of, god, on, which, the, religion, is, based, besides, the, quran, muhammad, s, teachings, and, practices, sunnah, found, in, transmitted, reports, hadith, and, in, his, biography, s, rah, are, also, upheld, and, used, as, sources, of, islamic, law, the, quran, is, the, central, religious, text, of, islam, muslims, believe, it, represents, the, words, of, god, revealed, by, the, archangel, gabriel, to, muhammad, the, quran, is, mainly, addressed, to, a, single, messenger, of, god, who, is, referred, to, as, muhammad, in, a, number, of, verses, the, quranic, text, also, describes, the, settlement, of, his, followers, in, yathrib, after, their, expulsion, by, the, quraysh, and, briefly, mentions, military, encounters, such, as, the, muslim, victory, at, badr, the, quran, however, provides, minimal, assistance, for, muhammad, s, chronological, biography, most, quranic, verses, do, not, provide, significant, historical, context, and, timeline, almost, none, of, muhammad, s, companions, are, mentioned, by, name, in, the, quran, hence, not, providing, sufficient, information, for, a, concise, biography, the, quran, is, considered, to, be, contemporary, with, muhammad, and, the, birmingham, manuscript, has, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, his, lifetime, its, discovery, largely, disproving, western, revisionist, theories, about, the, quran, s, origins, important, sources, regarding, muhammad, s, life, may, be, found, in, the, historic, works, by, writers, of, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, of, the, hijri, era, around, the, 8th, and, 9th, century, ce, respectively, these, include, traditional, muslim, biographies, of, muhammad, which, provide, additional, information, about, his, life, the, earliest, written, sira, biographies, of, muhammad, and, quotes, attributed, to, him, is, ibn, ishaq, s, life, of, god, s, messenger, written, c, 767, ce, 150, ah, although, the, original, work, was, lost, this, sira, survives, as, extensive, excerpts, in, works, by, ibn, hisham, and, to, a, lesser, extent, by, al, tabari, however, ibn, hisham, wrote, in, the, preface, to, his, biography, of, muhammad, that, he, omitted, matters, from, ibn, ishaq, s, biography, that, would, distress, certain, people, another, early, historical, source, is, the, history, of, muhammad, s, campaigns, by, al, waqidi, d, 207, ah, and, the, work, of, waqidi, s, secretary, ibn, sa, d, al, baghdadi, d, 230, ah, due, to, these, early, biographical, efforts, more, is, known, about, muhammad, than, almost, any, other, founder, of, a, major, religion, many, scholars, accept, these, early, biographies, as, authentic, however, waqidi, s, biography, has, been, widely, criticized, by, islamic, scholars, for, his, methods, in, particular, his, decision, to, omit, his, sources, recent, studies, have, led, scholars, to, distinguish, between, traditions, touching, legal, matters, and, purely, historical, events, in, the, legal, group, traditions, could, have, been, subject, to, invention, while, historic, events, aside, from, exceptional, cases, may, have, been, subject, only, to, tendential, shaping, other, scholars, have, criticized, the, reliability, of, this, method, suggesting, that, one, cannot, neatly, divide, traditions, into, purely, legal, and, historical, categories, western, historians, describe, the, purpose, of, these, early, biographies, as, largely, to, convey, a, message, rather, than, to, strictly, and, accurately, record, history, other, important, sources, include, the, hadith, collections, accounts, of, verbal, and, physical, teachings, and, traditions, attributed, to, muhammad, hadiths, were, compiled, several, generations, after, his, death, by, muslims, including, muhammad, al, bukhari, muslim, ibn, al, hajjaj, muhammad, ibn, isa, at, tirmidhi, abd, ar, rahman, al, nasai, abu, dawood, ibn, majah, malik, ibn, anas, al, daraqutni, muslim, scholars, have, typically, placed, a, greater, emphasis, on, the, hadith, literature, instead, of, the, biographical, literature, since, hadiths, maintain, a, traditional, chain, of, transmission, isnad, the, lack, of, such, a, chain, for, the, biographical, literature, makes, it, unverifiable, in, their, eyes, the, hadiths, generally, present, an, idealized, view, of, muhammad, western, scholars, have, expressed, skepticism, regarding, the, verifiability, of, these, chains, of, transmission, it, is, widely, believed, by, western, scholars, that, there, was, widespread, fabrication, of, hadith, during, the, early, centuries, of, islam, to, support, certain, theological, and, legal, positions, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, is, very, likely, that, a, considerable, number, of, hadiths, that, can, be, found, in, the, hadith, collections, did, not, actually, originate, with, the, prophet, in, addition, the, meaning, of, a, hadith, may, have, drifted, from, its, original, telling, to, when, it, was, finally, written, down, even, if, the, chain, of, transmission, is, authentic, overall, some, western, academics, have, cautiously, viewed, the, hadith, collections, as, accurate, historical, sources, while, the, dominant, paradigm, in, western, scholarship, is, to, consider, their, reliability, suspect, scholars, such, as, wilferd, madelung, do, not, reject, the, hadith, which, have, been, compiled, in, later, periods, but, judge, them, in, their, historical, context, muhammad, ibn, abdullah, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, ibn, hashim, was, born, in, mecca, about, the, year, 570, and, his, birthday, is, believed, to, be, in, the, month, of, rabi, al, awwal, he, belonged, to, the, banu, hashim, clan, of, the, quraysh, tribe, which, was, a, dominant, force, in, western, arabia, while, his, clan, was, one, of, the, more, distinguished, in, the, tribe, it, seems, to, have, experienced, a, lack, of, prosperity, during, his, early, years, according, to, muslim, tradition, muhammad, was, a, hanif, someone, who, professed, monotheism, in, pre, islamic, arabia, he, is, also, claimed, to, have, been, a, descendant, of, ishmael, son, of, abraham, the, name, muhammad, means, praiseworthy, in, arabic, and, it, appears, four, times, in, the, quran, he, was, also, known, as, al, amin, lit, faithful, when, he, was, young, however, historians, differ, as, to, whether, it, was, given, by, people, as, a, reflection, of, his, nature, or, was, simply, a, given, name, from, his, parents, i, e, a, masculine, form, of, his, mother, s, name, amina, muhammad, acquired, the, kunya, of, abu, al, qasim, later, in, his, life, after, the, birth, of, his, son, qasim, who, died, two, years, afterwards, islamic, tradition, states, that, muhammad, s, birth, year, coincided, with, the, year, of, the, elephant, when, abraha, the, aksumite, viceroy, in, the, former, himyarite, kingdom, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, conquer, mecca, recent, studies, however, challenge, this, notion, as, other, evidence, suggests, that, the, expedition, if, it, had, occurred, would, have, transpired, substantially, before, muhammad, s, birth, later, muslim, scholars, presumably, linked, abraha, s, renowned, name, to, the, narrative, of, muhammad, s, birth, to, elucidate, the, unclear, passage, about, the, men, of, elephants, in, quran, 105, 1, 5, the, oxford, handbook, of, late, antiquity, deems, the, tale, of, abraha, s, war, elephant, expedition, as, a, myth, muhammad, s, father, abdullah, died, almost, six, months, before, he, was, born, muhammad, then, stayed, with, his, foster, mother, halimah, bint, abi, dhuayb, and, her, husband, until, he, was, two, years, old, at, the, age, of, six, muhammad, lost, his, biological, mother, amina, to, illness, and, became, an, orphan, for, the, next, two, years, until, he, was, eight, years, old, muhammad, was, under, the, guardianship, of, his, paternal, grandfather, abd, al, muttalib, until, the, latter, s, death, he, then, came, under, the, care, of, his, uncle, abu, talib, the, new, leader, of, the, banu, hashim, abu, talib, s, brothers, assisted, with, muhammad, s, learning, hamza, the, youngest, trained, muhammad, in, archery, swordsmanship, and, martial, arts, another, uncle, abbas, provided, muhammad, with, a, job, leading, caravans, on, the, northern, segment, of, the, route, to, syria, the, historical, record, of, mecca, during, muhammad, s, early, life, is, limited, and, fragmentary, making, it, difficult, to, distinguish, between, fact, and, legend, several, islamic, narratives, relate, that, muhammad, as, a, child, went, on, a, trading, trip, to, syria, with, his, uncle, abu, talib, and, met, a, monk, named, bahira, who, is, said, to, have, then, foretold, his, prophethood, there, are, multiple, versions, of, the, story, with, details, that, contradict, each, other, all, accounts, of, bahira, and, his, meeting, with, muhammad, have, been, considered, fictitious, by, modern, historians, as, well, as, by, some, medieval, muslim, scholars, such, as, al, dhahabi, sometime, later, in, his, life, muhammad, proposed, marriage, to, his, cousin, and, first, love, fakhita, bint, abi, talib, but, likely, owing, to, his, poverty, his, proposal, was, rejected, by, her, father, abu, talib, who, chose, a, more, illustrious, suitor, when, muhammad, was, 25, his, fortunes, turned, around, his, business, reputation, caught, the, attention, of, his, 40, year, old, distant, relative, khadijah, a, wealthy, businesswoman, who, had, staked, out, a, successful, career, as, a, merchant, in, the, caravan, trade, industry, she, asked, him, to, take, one, of, her, caravans, into, syria, after, which, she, was, so, impressed, by, his, competence, in, the, expedition, that, she, proposed, marriage, to, him, muhammad, accepted, her, offer, and, remained, monogamous, with, her, until, her, death, in, 605, the, quraysh, decided, to, roof, the, kaaba, which, had, previously, consisted, only, of, walls, a, complete, rebuild, was, needed, to, accommodate, the, new, weight, amid, concerns, about, upsetting, the, deities, a, man, stepped, forth, with, a, pickaxe, and, exclaimed, o, goddess, fear, not, our, intentions, are, only, for, the, best, with, that, he, began, demolishing, it, the, anxious, meccans, awaited, divine, retribution, overnight, but, his, unharmed, continuation, the, next, day, was, seen, as, a, sign, of, heavenly, approval, according, to, a, narrative, collected, by, ibn, ishaq, when, it, was, time, to, reattach, the, black, stone, a, dispute, arose, over, which, clan, should, have, the, privilege, it, was, determined, that, the, first, person, to, step, into, the, kaaba, s, court, would, arbitrate, muhammad, took, on, this, role, asking, for, a, cloak, he, placed, the, stone, on, it, guiding, clan, representatives, to, jointly, elevate, it, to, its, position, he, then, personally, secured, it, within, the, wall, the, financial, security, muhammad, enjoyed, from, khadija, his, wealthy, wife, gave, him, plenty, of, free, time, to, spend, in, solitude, in, the, cave, of, hira, according, to, islamic, tradition, one, day, in, 610, ce, when, he, was, 40, years, old, the, angel, gabriel, appeared, to, him, during, his, visit, to, the, cave, the, angel, showed, him, a, cloth, with, quranic, verses, on, it, and, instructed, him, to, read, when, muhammad, confessed, his, illiteracy, gabriel, choked, him, forcefully, nearly, suffocating, him, and, repeated, the, command, as, muhammad, reiterated, his, inability, to, read, gabriel, choked, him, again, in, a, similar, manner, this, sequence, took, place, once, more, before, gabriel, finally, recited, the, verses, allowing, muhammad, to, memorize, them, these, verses, later, constituted, quran, 96, 1, 5, when, muhammad, came, to, his, senses, he, felt, scared, he, started, to, think, that, after, all, of, this, spiritual, struggle, he, had, been, visited, by, a, jinn, which, made, him, no, longer, want, to, live, in, desperation, muhammad, fled, from, the, cave, and, began, climbing, up, towards, the, top, of, the, mountain, to, jump, to, his, death, but, when, he, reached, the, summit, he, experienced, another, vision, this, time, seeing, a, mighty, being, that, engulfed, the, horizon, and, stared, back, at, muhammad, even, when, he, turned, to, face, a, different, direction, this, was, the, spirit, of, revelation, r, which, muhammad, later, referred, to, as, gabriel, it, was, not, a, naturalistic, angel, but, rather, a, transcendent, presence, that, resisted, the, ordinary, limits, of, humanity, and, space, frightened, and, unable, to, understand, the, experience, muhammad, hurriedly, staggered, down, the, mountain, to, his, wife, khadijah, by, the, time, he, got, to, her, he, was, already, crawling, on, his, hands, and, knees, shaking, wildly, and, crying, cover, me, as, he, thrusted, himself, onto, her, lap, khadijah, wrapped, him, in, a, cloak, and, tucked, him, in, her, arms, until, his, fears, dissipated, she, had, absolutely, no, doubts, about, his, revelation, she, insisted, it, was, real, and, not, a, jinn, muhammad, was, also, reassured, by, khadija, s, christian, cousin, waraqa, ibn, nawfal, who, jubilantly, exclaimed, holy, holy, if, you, have, spoken, the, truth, to, me, o, khadijah, there, has, come, to, him, the, great, divinity, who, came, to, moses, aforetime, and, lo, he, is, the, prophet, of, his, people, khadija, instructed, muhammad, to, let, her, know, if, gabriel, returned, when, he, appeared, during, their, private, time, khadija, conducted, tests, by, having, muhammad, sit, on, her, left, thigh, right, thigh, and, lap, inquiring, muhammad, if, the, being, was, still, present, each, time, after, khadija, removed, her, clothes, with, muhammad, on, her, lap, he, reported, that, gabriel, left, at, that, moment, khadija, thus, told, him, to, rejoice, as, she, concluded, it, was, not, satan, but, an, angel, visiting, him, muhammad, s, demeanor, during, his, moments, of, inspiration, frequently, led, to, allegations, from, his, contemporaries, that, he, was, under, the, influence, of, a, jinn, a, soothsayer, or, a, magician, suggesting, that, his, experiences, during, these, events, bore, resemblance, to, those, associated, with, such, figures, widely, recognized, in, ancient, arabia, nonetheless, these, enigmatic, seizure, events, might, have, served, as, persuasive, evidence, for, his, followers, regarding, the, divine, origin, of, his, revelations, some, historians, posit, that, the, graphic, descriptions, of, muhammad, s, condition, in, these, instances, are, likely, genuine, as, they, are, improbable, to, have, been, concocted, by, later, muslims, shortly, after, waraqa, s, death, the, revelations, ceased, for, a, period, causing, muhammad, great, distress, and, thoughts, of, suicide, on, one, occasion, he, reportedly, climbed, a, mountain, intending, to, jump, off, however, upon, reaching, the, peak, gabriel, appeared, to, him, affirming, his, status, as, the, true, messenger, of, god, this, encounter, soothed, muhammad, and, he, returned, home, later, when, there, was, another, long, break, between, revelations, he, repeated, this, action, but, gabriel, intervened, similarly, calming, him, and, causing, him, to, return, home, muhammad, was, confident, that, he, could, distinguish, his, own, thoughts, from, these, messages, the, early, quranic, revelations, utilized, approaches, of, cautioning, non, believers, with, divine, punishment, while, promising, rewards, to, believers, they, conveyed, potential, consequences, like, famine, and, killing, for, those, who, rejected, muhammad, s, god, and, alluded, to, past, and, future, calamities, the, verses, also, stressed, the, imminent, final, judgment, and, the, threat, of, hellfire, for, skeptics, due, to, the, complexity, of, the, experience, muhammad, was, initially, very, reluctant, to, tell, others, about, his, revelations, at, first, he, confided, in, only, a, few, select, family, members, and, friends, according, to, muslim, tradition, muhammad, s, wife, khadija, was, the, first, to, believe, he, was, a, prophet, she, was, followed, by, muhammad, s, ten, year, old, cousin, ali, ibn, abi, talib, close, friend, abu, bakr, and, adopted, son, zaid, as, word, of, muhammad, s, revelations, continued, to, spread, throughout, the, rest, of, his, family, they, became, increasingly, divided, on, the, matter, with, the, youth, and, women, generally, believing, in, him, while, most, of, the, men, in, the, elder, generations, were, staunchly, opposed, around, 613, muhammad, began, to, preach, to, the, public, many, of, his, first, followers, were, women, freedmen, servants, slaves, and, other, members, of, the, lower, social, class, these, converts, keenly, awaited, each, new, revelation, from, muhammad, when, he, recited, it, they, all, would, repeat, after, him, and, memorize, it, and, the, literate, ones, recorded, it, in, writing, muhammad, also, introduced, rituals, to, his, group, which, included, prayer, salat, with, physical, postures, that, embodied, complete, surrender, islam, to, god, and, almsgiving, zakat, as, a, requirement, of, the, muslim, community, ummah, by, this, point, muhammad, s, religious, movement, was, known, as, tazakka, purification, initially, he, had, no, serious, opposition, from, the, inhabitants, of, mecca, who, were, indifferent, to, his, proselytizing, activities, but, when, he, started, to, attack, their, beliefs, tensions, arose, the, quraysh, challenged, him, to, perform, miracles, such, as, bringing, forth, springs, of, water, yet, he, declined, reasoning, that, the, regularities, of, nature, already, served, as, sufficient, proof, of, god, s, majesty, some, satirized, his, lack, of, success, by, wondering, why, god, had, not, bestowed, treasure, upon, him, others, called, on, him, to, visit, paradise, and, return, with, tangible, parchment, scrolls, of, the, qur, an, but, muhammad, asserted, that, the, quran, in, the, form, he, conveyed, it, was, already, an, extraordinary, proof, according, to, amr, ibn, al, as, several, of, the, quraysh, gathered, at, hijr, and, discussed, how, they, had, never, faced, such, serious, problems, as, they, were, facing, from, muhammad, they, said, that, he, had, derided, their, culture, denigrated, their, ancestors, scorned, their, faith, shattered, their, community, and, cursed, their, gods, sometime, later, muhammad, came, kissing, the, black, stone, and, performing, the, ritual, tawaf, as, muhammad, passed, by, them, they, reportedly, said, hurtful, things, to, him, the, same, happened, when, he, passed, by, them, a, second, time, on, his, third, pass, muhammad, stopped, and, said, will, you, listen, to, me, o, quraysh, by, him, god, who, holds, my, life, in, his, hand, i, bring, you, slaughter, they, fell, silent, and, told, him, to, go, home, saying, that, he, was, not, a, violent, man, the, next, day, a, number, of, quraysh, approached, him, asking, if, he, had, said, what, they, had, heard, from, their, companions, he, answered, yes, and, one, of, them, seized, him, by, his, cloak, abu, bakr, intervened, tearfully, saying, would, you, kill, a, man, for, saying, god, is, my, lord, and, they, left, him, the, quraysh, attempted, to, entice, muhammad, to, quit, preaching, by, giving, him, admission, to, the, merchants, inner, circle, as, well, as, an, advantageous, marriage, but, he, refused, both, of, the, offers, a, delegation, of, them, then, led, by, the, leader, of, the, makhzum, clan, known, by, the, muslims, as, abu, jahl, went, to, muhammad, s, uncle, abu, talib, head, of, the, hashim, clan, and, muhammad, s, caretaker, giving, him, an, ultimatum, to, disown, muhammad, by, god, we, can, no, longer, endure, this, vilification, of, our, forefathers, this, derision, of, our, traditional, values, this, abuse, of, our, gods, either, you, stop, muhammad, yourself, abu, talib, or, you, must, let, us, stop, him, since, you, yourself, take, the, same, position, as, we, do, in, opposition, to, what, he, s, saying, we, will, rid, you, of, him, abu, talib, politely, dismissed, them, at, first, thinking, it, was, just, a, heated, talk, but, as, muhammad, grew, more, vocal, abu, talib, requested, muhammad, to, not, burden, him, beyond, what, he, could, bear, to, which, muhammad, wept, and, replied, that, he, would, not, stop, even, if, they, put, the, sun, in, his, right, hand, and, the, moon, in, his, left, when, he, turned, around, abu, talib, called, him, and, said, come, back, nephew, say, what, you, please, for, by, god, i, will, never, give, you, up, on, any, account, the, leaders, of, the, quraysh, sent, nadr, ibn, al, harith, and, uqba, ibn, abi, mu, ayt, to, yathrib, to, seek, the, opinions, of, the, jewish, rabbis, regarding, muhammad, the, rabbis, advised, them, to, ask, muhammad, three, questions, recount, the, tale, of, young, men, who, ventured, forth, in, the, first, age, narrate, the, story, of, a, traveler, who, reached, both, the, eastern, and, western, ends, of, the, earth, and, provide, details, about, the, spirit, if, muhammad, answered, correctly, they, stated, he, would, be, a, prophet, otherwise, he, would, be, a, liar, when, they, returned, to, mecca, and, asked, muhammad, the, questions, he, told, them, he, would, provide, the, answers, the, next, day, however, 15, days, passed, without, a, response, from, his, god, leading, to, gossip, among, the, meccans, and, causing, muhammad, distress, at, some, point, later, the, angel, gabriel, came, to, muhammad, and, provided, him, with, the, answers, in, response, to, the, first, query, the, qur, an, tells, a, story, about, a, group, of, men, sleeping, in, a, cave, qur, an, 18, 9, 25, which, scholars, generally, link, to, the, legend, of, the, seven, sleepers, of, ephesus, for, the, second, query, the, qur, an, speaks, of, dhu, al, qarnayn, literally, he, of, the, two, horns, qur, an, 18, 93, 99, a, tale, that, academics, widely, associate, with, the, alexander, romance, as, for, the, third, query, concerning, the, nature, of, the, spirit, the, qur, anic, revelation, asserted, that, it, was, beyond, human, comprehension, neither, the, jews, who, devised, the, questions, nor, the, quraysh, who, posed, them, to, muhammad, converted, to, islam, upon, receiving, the, answers, nadr, and, uqba, were, later, executed, on, muhammad, s, orders, after, the, battle, of, badr, while, other, captives, were, held, for, ransom, as, uqba, pleaded, but, who, will, take, care, of, my, children, muhammad, muhammad, responded, hell, in, 615, muhammad, sent, some, of, his, followers, to, emigrate, to, the, abyssinian, kingdom, of, aksum, and, found, a, small, colony, under, the, protection, of, the, christian, ethiopian, emperor, a, ama, ibn, abjar, among, those, who, departed, were, umm, habiba, the, daughter, of, one, of, the, quraysh, chiefs, abu, sufyan, and, her, husband, the, quraysh, then, sent, two, men, to, retrieve, them, because, leatherwork, at, the, time, was, highly, prized, in, abyssinia, they, gathered, a, lot, of, skins, and, transported, them, there, so, they, could, distribute, some, to, each, of, the, kingdom, s, generals, but, the, king, firmly, rejected, their, request, while, tabari, and, ibn, hisham, mentioned, only, one, migration, to, abyssinia, there, were, two, sets, according, to, ibn, sa, d, of, these, two, the, majority, of, the, first, group, returned, to, mecca, before, the, event, of, hijra, while, the, majority, of, the, second, group, remained, in, abyssinia, at, the, time, and, went, directly, to, medina, after, the, event, of, hijra, these, accounts, agree, that, persecution, played, a, major, role, in, muhammad, sending, them, there, according, to, historian, w, m, watt, the, episodes, were, more, complex, than, the, traditional, accounts, suggest, he, proposes, that, there, were, divisions, within, the, embryonic, muslim, community, and, that, they, likely, went, there, to, trade, in, competition, with, the, prominent, merchant, families, of, mecca, in, urwa, s, letter, preserved, by, tabari, these, emigrants, returned, after, the, conversion, to, islam, of, a, number, of, individuals, in, positions, such, as, hamza, and, umar, along, with, many, others, tabari, recorded, that, muhammad, was, desperate, hoping, for, an, accommodation, with, his, tribe, so, while, he, was, in, the, presence, of, a, number, of, quraysh, after, delivering, verses, mentioning, three, of, their, favorite, deities, quran, 53, 19, 20, satan, put, upon, his, tongue, two, short, verses, these, are, the, high, flying, ones, whose, intercession, is, to, be, hoped, for, this, led, to, a, general, reconciliation, between, muhammad, and, the, meccans, and, the, muslims, in, abyssinia, began, to, return, home, however, the, next, day, muhammad, retracted, these, verses, at, the, behest, of, gabriel, claiming, that, they, had, been, cast, by, satan, to, his, tongue, and, god, had, abrogated, them, instead, verses, that, revile, those, goddesses, were, then, revealed, the, returning, muslims, thus, had, to, make, arrangements, for, clan, protection, before, they, could, re, enter, mecca, this, satanic, verses, incident, was, reported, en, masse, and, documented, by, nearly, all, of, the, major, biographers, of, muhammad, in, islam, s, first, two, centuries, which, according, to, them, corresponds, to, quran, 22, 52, but, since, the, rise, of, the, hadith, movement, and, systematic, theology, with, its, new, doctrines, including, the, isma, which, claimed, that, muhammad, was, infallible, and, thus, could, not, be, fooled, by, satan, the, historical, memory, of, the, early, community, has, been, reevaluated, as, of, the, 20th, century, ce, muslim, scholars, unanimously, rejected, this, incident, on, the, other, hand, most, european, biographers, of, muhammad, recognize, the, veracity, of, this, incident, of, satanic, verses, on, the, basis, of, the, criterion, of, embarrassment, historian, alfred, t, welch, proposes, that, the, period, of, muhammad, s, turning, away, from, strict, monotheism, was, likely, far, longer, but, was, later, encapsulated, in, a, story, that, made, it, much, shorter, and, implicated, satan, as, the, culprit, in, 616, an, agreement, was, established, whereby, all, other, quraysh, clans, were, to, enforce, a, ban, on, the, banu, hashim, prohibiting, trade, and, marriage, with, them, nevertheless, banu, hashim, members, could, still, move, around, the, town, freely, despite, facing, increasing, verbal, abuse, muhammad, continued, to, navigate, the, streets, and, engage, in, public, debates, without, being, physically, harmed, at, a, later, point, a, faction, within, quraysh, sympathizing, with, banu, hashim, initiated, efforts, to, end, the, sanctions, resulting, in, a, general, consensus, in, 619, to, lift, the, ban, in, 619, muhammad, faced, a, period, of, sorrow, his, wife, khadija, a, crucial, source, of, his, financial, and, emotional, support, died, in, the, same, year, his, uncle, and, guardian, abu, talib, also, died, despite, muhammad, s, persuasions, to, abu, talib, to, embrace, islam, on, his, deathbed, he, clung, to, his, polytheistic, beliefs, until, the, end, muhammad, s, other, uncle, abu, lahab, who, succeeded, the, banu, hashim, clan, leadership, was, initially, willing, to, provide, muhammad, with, protection, however, upon, hearing, from, muhammad, that, abu, talib, and, abd, al, muttalib, were, destined, for, hell, due, to, not, believing, in, islam, he, withdrew, his, support, muhammad, then, went, to, ta, if, to, try, to, establish, himself, in, the, city, and, gain, aid, and, protection, against, the, meccans, but, he, was, met, with, a, response, if, you, are, truly, a, prophet, what, need, do, you, have, of, our, help, if, god, sent, you, as, his, messenger, why, doesn, t, he, protect, you, and, if, allah, wished, to, send, a, prophet, couldn, t, he, have, found, a, better, person, than, you, a, weak, and, fatherless, orphan, realizing, his, efforts, were, in, vain, muhammad, asked, the, people, of, ta, if, to, keep, the, matter, a, secret, fearing, that, this, would, embolden, the, hostility, of, the, quraysh, against, him, however, instead, of, accepting, his, request, they, pelted, him, with, stones, injuring, his, limbs, he, eventually, evaded, this, chaos, and, persecution, by, escaping, to, the, garden, of, utbah, ibn, rabi, ah, a, meccan, chief, with, a, summer, residence, in, ta, if, muhammad, felt, despair, due, to, the, unexpected, rejection, and, hostility, he, received, in, the, city, at, this, point, he, realized, he, had, no, security, or, protection, except, from, god, so, he, began, praying, shortly, thereafter, utbah, s, christian, slave, addas, stopped, by, and, offered, grapes, which, muhammad, accepted, by, the, end, of, the, encounter, addas, felt, overwhelmed, and, kissed, muhammad, s, head, hands, and, feet, in, recognition, of, his, prophethood, on, muhammad, s, return, journey, to, mecca, news, of, the, events, in, ta, if, had, reached, the, ears, of, abu, jahl, and, he, said, they, did, not, allow, him, to, enter, ta, if, so, let, us, deny, him, entry, to, mecca, as, well, knowing, the, gravity, of, the, situation, muhammad, asked, a, passing, horseman, to, deliver, a, message, to, akhnas, ibn, shariq, a, member, of, his, mother, s, clan, requesting, his, protection, so, that, he, could, enter, in, safety, but, akhnas, declined, saying, that, he, was, only, a, confederate, of, the, house, of, quraysh, muhammad, then, sent, a, message, to, suhayl, ibn, amir, who, similarly, declined, on, the, basis, of, tribal, principle, finally, muhammad, dispatched, someone, to, ask, mut, im, ibn, adiy, the, chief, of, the, banu, nawfal, mut, im, agreed, and, after, equipping, himself, he, rode, out, in, the, morning, with, his, sons, and, nephews, to, accompany, muhammad, to, the, city, when, abu, jahl, saw, him, he, asked, if, mut, im, was, simply, giving, him, protection, or, if, he, had, already, converted, to, his, religion, mut, im, replied, granting, him, protection, of, course, then, abu, jahl, said, we, will, protect, whomever, you, protect, it, is, at, this, low, point, in, muhammad, s, life, that, the, accounts, in, the, sira, lay, out, the, famous, isra, and, mi, raj, nowadays, isra, is, believed, by, muslims, to, be, the, journey, of, muhammad, from, mecca, to, jerusalem, while, mi, raj, is, from, jerusalem, to, the, heavens, there, is, considered, no, substantial, basis, for, the, mi, raj, in, the, quran, as, the, quran, does, not, address, it, directly, quranic, verse, 17, 1, recounts, muhammad, s, night, journey, from, a, revered, place, of, prayer, to, the, most, distant, place, of, worship, the, kaaba, holy, enclosure, in, mecca, is, widely, accepted, as, the, starting, point, but, there, is, disagreement, among, islamic, traditions, as, to, what, constitutes, the, farthest, place, of, worship, some, modern, scholars, maintain, that, the, earliest, tradition, saw, this, faraway, site, as, a, celestial, twin, of, the, kaaba, so, that, muhammad, s, journey, took, him, directly, from, mecca, through, the, heavens, a, later, tradition, however, refers, to, it, as, bayt, al, maqdis, which, is, generally, associated, with, jerusalem, over, time, these, different, traditions, merged, to, present, the, journey, as, one, that, began, in, mecca, passed, through, jerusalem, and, then, ascended, to, heaven, the, dating, of, the, events, also, differs, from, account, to, account, ibn, sa, d, recorded, that, muhammad, s, mi, raj, took, place, first, from, near, the, kaaba, to, the, heavens, on, the, 27th, of, ramadan, 18, months, before, the, hijrah, while, the, isra, from, mecca, to, bayt, al, maqdis, took, place, on, the, 17th, night, of, the, last, rabi, ul, before, the, hijrah, as, is, well, known, these, two, stories, were, later, combined, into, one, in, ibn, hisham, s, account, the, isra, came, first, and, then, the, mi, raj, and, he, put, these, stories, before, the, deaths, of, khadija, and, abu, talib, in, contrast, al, tabari, included, only, the, story, of, muhammad, s, ascension, from, the, sanctuary, in, mecca, to, the, earthly, heaven, tabari, placed, this, story, at, the, beginning, of, muhammad, s, public, ministry, between, his, account, of, khadija, becoming, the, first, to, believe, in, the, messenger, of, god, and, his, account, of, the, first, male, to, believe, in, the, messenger, of, god, as, resistance, to, his, proselytism, in, mecca, grew, muhammad, began, to, limit, his, efforts, to, non, meccans, who, attended, fairs, or, made, pilgrimages, during, this, period, muhammad, had, an, encounter, with, six, individuals, from, the, banu, khazraj, these, men, had, a, history, of, raiding, jews, in, their, locality, who, in, turn, would, warn, them, that, a, prophet, would, be, sent, to, punish, them, on, hearing, muhammad, s, religious, message, they, said, to, each, other, this, is, the, very, prophet, of, whom, the, jews, warned, us, don, t, let, them, get, to, him, before, us, upon, embracing, islam, they, returned, to, medina, and, shared, their, encounter, hoping, that, by, having, their, people, the, khazraj, and, the, aws, who, had, been, at, odds, for, so, long, accept, islam, and, adopt, muhammad, as, their, leader, unity, could, be, achieved, between, them, the, next, year, five, of, the, earlier, converts, revisited, muhammad, bringing, with, them, seven, newcomers, three, of, whom, were, from, the, banu, aws, at, aqaba, near, mecca, they, pledged, their, loyalty, to, him, muhammad, then, entrusted, mus, ab, ibn, umayr, to, join, them, on, their, return, to, medina, to, promote, islam, come, june, 622, a, significant, clandestine, meeting, was, convened, again, at, aqaba, in, this, gathering, seventy, five, individuals, from, yathrib, medina, attended, including, two, women, representing, all, the, converts, of, the, oases, muhammad, asked, them, to, protect, him, as, they, would, protect, their, wives, and, children, they, concurred, and, gave, him, their, oath, commonly, referred, to, as, the, second, pledge, of, aqaba, or, the, pledge, of, war, paradise, was, muhammad, s, promise, to, them, in, exchange, for, their, loyalty, subsequently, muhammad, called, upon, the, meccan, muslims, to, relocate, to, medina, this, event, is, known, as, the, hijrah, which, basically, means, severing, of, kinship, ties, the, departures, spanned, approximately, three, months, to, avoid, arriving, in, medina, by, himself, with, his, followers, remaining, in, mecca, muhammad, chose, not, to, go, ahead, and, instead, stayed, back, to, watch, over, them, and, persuade, those, who, were, reluctant, some, were, held, back, by, their, families, from, leaving, but, in, the, end, there, were, no, muslims, left, in, mecca, islamic, tradition, recounts, that, in, light, of, the, unfolding, events, abu, jahl, proposed, a, joint, assassination, of, muhammad, by, representatives, of, each, clan, having, been, informed, about, this, by, the, angel, gabriel, muhammad, asked, his, cousin, ali, to, lie, in, his, bed, covered, with, his, green, hadrami, mantle, assuring, that, it, would, safeguard, him, that, night, the, group, of, planned, assassins, approached, muhammad, s, home, to, carry, out, the, attack, but, changed, their, minds, upon, hearing, the, voices, of, sawdah, and, some, of, muhammad, s, daughters, since, it, was, considered, shameful, to, kill, a, man, in, front, of, the, women, in, his, family, they, instead, chose, to, wait, until, muhammad, left, the, house, the, next, morning, one, of, the, men, peeked, into, a, window, and, saw, what, he, believed, to, be, muhammad, but, was, actually, ali, dressed, in, muhammad, s, cloak, though, unbeknownst, to, them, muhammad, had, previously, escaped, from, the, back, of, the, residence, when, ali, went, outside, to, go, for, a, walk, the, following, morning, the, men, realized, they, had, been, fooled, and, the, quraysh, consequently, offered, a, 100, camel, bounty, for, the, return, of, muhammad, s, body, dead, or, alive, after, staying, hidden, for, three, days, muhammad, subsequently, departed, with, abu, bakr, for, medina, which, at, the, time, was, still, named, yathrib, the, two, men, arrived, in, medina, on, 4, september, 622, the, meccan, muslims, who, undertook, the, migration, were, then, called, the, muhajirun, while, the, medinan, muslims, were, dubbed, the, ansar, a, few, days, after, settling, in, medina, muhammad, negotiated, for, the, purchase, of, a, piece, of, land, upon, this, plot, the, muslims, began, constructing, a, building, that, would, become, muhammad, s, residence, as, well, as, a, community, gathering, place, masjid, for, prayer, salat, tree, trunks, were, used, as, pillars, to, hold, up, the, roof, and, there, was, no, fancy, pulpit, instead, muhammad, stood, on, top, of, a, small, stool, to, speak, to, the, congregation, the, structure, was, completed, after, about, seven, months, in, april, 623, becoming, the, first, muslim, building, and, mosque, its, northern, wall, had, a, stone, marking, the, direction, of, prayer, qiblah, which, was, jerusalem, at, that, time, muhammad, used, the, building, to, host, public, and, political, meetings, as, well, as, a, place, for, the, poor, to, gather, to, receive, alms, food, and, care, christians, and, jews, were, also, allowed, to, participate, in, community, worship, at, the, mosque, initially, muhammad, s, religion, had, no, organized, way, to, call, the, community, to, prayer, in, a, coordinated, manner, to, resolve, this, muhammad, had, considered, using, a, ram, s, horn, shofar, like, the, jews, or, a, wooden, clapper, like, the, christians, but, one, of, the, muslims, in, the, community, had, a, dream, where, a, man, in, a, green, cloak, told, him, that, someone, with, a, loud, booming, voice, should, announce, the, service, by, crying, out, allahu, akbar, god, is, greater, to, remind, muslims, of, their, top, priority, when, muhammad, heard, about, this, dream, he, agreed, with, the, idea, and, selected, bilal, a, former, abyssinian, slave, known, for, his, loud, voice, the, constitution, of, medina, was, a, legal, covenant, written, by, muhammad, in, the, constitution, medina, s, arab, and, jewish, tribes, promised, to, live, peacefully, alongside, the, muslims, and, to, refrain, from, making, a, separate, treaty, with, mecca, it, also, guaranteed, the, jews, freedom, of, religion, in, the, agreement, everyone, under, its, jurisdiction, was, required, to, defend, and, protect, the, oasis, if, attacked, politically, the, agreement, helped, muhammad, better, understand, which, people, were, on, his, side, ibn, ishaq, following, his, narration, of, the, hijrah, maintains, that, muhammad, penned, the, text, and, divulges, its, assumed, content, without, supplying, any, isnad, or, corroboration, the, appellation, is, generally, deemed, imprecise, as, the, text, neither, established, a, state, nor, enacted, quranic, statutes, but, rather, addressed, tribal, matters, while, scholars, from, both, the, west, and, the, muslim, world, agree, on, the, text, s, authenticity, disagreements, persist, on, whether, it, was, a, treaty, or, a, unilateral, proclamation, by, muhammad, the, number, of, documents, it, comprised, the, primary, parties, the, specific, timing, of, its, creation, or, that, of, its, constituent, parts, whether, it, was, drafted, before, or, after, muhammad, s, removal, of, the, three, leading, jewish, tribes, of, medina, and, the, proper, approach, to, translating, it, following, the, emigration, the, people, of, mecca, seized, property, of, muslim, emigrants, to, medina, war, would, later, break, out, between, the, people, of, mecca, and, the, muslims, muhammad, delivered, quranic, verses, permitting, muslims, to, fight, the, meccans, according, to, the, traditional, account, on, 11, february, 624, while, praying, in, the, masjid, al, qiblatayn, in, medina, muhammad, received, revelations, from, god, that, he, should, be, facing, mecca, rather, than, jerusalem, during, prayer, muhammad, adjusted, to, the, new, direction, and, his, companions, praying, with, him, followed, his, lead, beginning, the, tradition, of, facing, mecca, during, prayer, permission, has, been, given, to, those, who, are, being, fought, because, they, were, wronged, and, indeed, allah, is, competent, to, give, them, victory, those, who, have, been, evicted, from, their, homes, without, right, only, because, they, say, our, lord, is, allah, and, were, it, not, that, allah, checks, the, people, some, by, means, of, others, there, would, have, been, demolished, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and, mosques, in, which, the, name, of, allah, is, much, mentioned, and, allah, will, surely, support, those, who, support, him, indeed, allah, is, powerful, and, exalted, in, might, quran, 22, 39, 40, muhammad, ordered, a, number, of, raids, to, capture, meccan, caravans, but, only, the, 8th, of, them, the, raid, of, nakhla, resulted, in, actual, fighting, and, capture, of, booty, and, prisoners, in, march, 624, muhammad, led, some, three, hundred, warriors, in, a, raid, on, a, meccan, merchant, caravan, the, muslims, set, an, ambush, for, the, caravan, at, badr, aware, of, the, plan, the, meccan, caravan, eluded, the, muslims, a, meccan, force, was, sent, to, protect, the, caravan, and, went, on, to, confront, the, muslims, upon, receiving, word, that, the, caravan, was, safe, due, to, being, outnumbered, more, than, three, to, one, a, spirit, of, fear, ran, throughout, the, muslim, camp, muhammad, tried, to, boost, their, morale, by, telling, them, he, had, a, dream, in, which, god, promised, to, send, 1, 000, angels, to, fight, with, them, from, a, tactical, standpoint, muhammad, placed, troops, in, front, of, all, of, the, wells, so, the, quraysh, would, have, to, fight, for, water, and, positioned, other, troops, in, such, a, way, that, would, require, the, quraysh, to, fight, uphill, while, also, facing, the, sun, the, battle, of, badr, commenced, and, the, muslims, ultimately, won, killing, at, least, forty, five, meccans, with, fourteen, muslims, dead, they, also, succeeded, in, killing, many, meccan, leaders, including, abu, jahl, seventy, prisoners, had, been, acquired, many, of, whom, were, ransomed, muhammad, and, his, followers, saw, the, victory, as, confirmation, of, their, faith, and, muhammad, ascribed, the, victory, to, the, assistance, of, an, invisible, host, of, angels, the, quranic, verses, of, this, period, unlike, the, meccan, verses, dealt, with, practical, problems, of, government, and, issues, like, the, distribution, of, spoils, the, victory, strengthened, muhammad, s, position, in, medina, and, dispelled, earlier, doubts, among, his, followers, as, a, result, the, opposition, to, him, became, less, vocal, pagans, who, had, not, yet, converted, were, very, bitter, about, the, advance, of, islam, two, pagans, asma, bint, marwan, of, the, aws, manat, tribe, and, abu, afak, of, the, amr, b, awf, tribe, had, composed, verses, taunting, and, insulting, the, muslims, they, were, killed, by, people, belonging, to, their, own, or, related, clans, and, muhammad, did, not, disapprove, of, the, killings, this, report, however, is, considered, by, some, to, be, a, fabrication, most, members, of, those, tribes, converted, to, islam, and, little, pagan, opposition, remained, muhammad, expelled, from, medina, the, banu, qaynuqa, one, of, three, main, jewish, tribes, but, some, historians, contend, that, the, expulsion, happened, after, muhammad, s, death, according, to, al, waqidi, after, abd, allah, ibn, ubaiy, spoke, for, them, muhammad, refrained, from, executing, them, and, commanded, that, they, be, exiled, from, medina, following, the, battle, of, badr, muhammad, also, made, mutual, aid, alliances, with, a, number, of, bedouin, tribes, to, protect, his, community, from, attacks, from, the, northern, part, of, hejaz, once, the, ransom, arrangements, for, the, meccan, captives, were, finalized, he, initiated, a, siege, on, the, banu, qaynuqa, regarded, as, the, weakest, and, wealthiest, of, medina, s, three, main, jewish, tribes, muslim, sources, provide, different, reasons, for, the, siege, including, an, altercation, involving, hamza, and, ali, in, the, banu, qaynuqa, market, and, another, version, by, ibn, ishaq, which, tells, the, story, of, a, muslim, woman, being, pranked, by, a, qaynuqa, goldsmith, regardless, of, the, cause, the, banu, qaynuqa, sought, refuge, in, their, fort, where, muhammad, blockaded, them, cutting, off, their, access, to, food, supplies, the, banu, qaynuqa, requested, help, from, their, arab, allies, but, the, arabs, refused, since, they, were, supporters, of, muhammad, after, roughly, two, weeks, the, banu, qaynuqa, capitulated, without, engaging, in, combat, following, the, surrender, of, the, qaynuqa, muhammad, was, moving, to, execute, the, men, of, the, tribe, when, abdullah, ibn, ubayy, a, muslim, khazraj, chieftain, who, had, been, aided, by, the, qaynuqa, in, the, past, encouraged, muhammad, to, show, leniency, in, a, narrated, incident, muhammad, turned, away, from, ibn, ubayy, but, undeterred, the, chieftain, grasped, muhammad, s, cloak, and, refused, to, let, go, until, muhammad, agreed, to, treat, the, tribe, leniently, despite, being, angered, by, the, incident, muhammad, spared, the, qaynuqa, stipulating, that, they, must, depart, medina, within, three, days, and, relinquish, their, property, to, the, muslims, with, a, fifth, khums, being, retained, by, muhammad, back, in, medina, ka, b, ibn, al, ashraf, a, wealthy, half, jewish, man, from, banu, nadir, and, staunch, critic, of, muhammad, had, just, returned, from, mecca, after, producing, poetry, that, mourned, the, death, of, the, quraysh, at, badr, and, aroused, them, to, retaliate, when, muhammad, learned, of, this, incitement, against, the, muslims, he, asked, his, followers, who, is, ready, to, kill, ka, b, who, has, hurt, god, and, his, apostle, ibn, maslama, offered, his, services, explaining, that, the, task, would, require, deception, muhammad, did, not, contest, this, he, then, gathered, accomplices, including, ka, b, s, foster, brother, abu, naila, they, pretended, to, complain, about, their, post, conversion, hardships, persuading, ka, b, to, lend, them, food, on, the, night, of, their, meeting, with, ka, b, they, murdered, him, when, he, was, caught, off, guard, in, 625, the, quraysh, wearied, by, muhammad, s, continuous, attacks, on, their, caravans, decided, to, take, decisive, action, led, by, abu, sufyan, they, assembled, an, army, to, oppose, muhammad, upon, being, alerted, by, his, scout, about, the, impending, threat, muhammad, convened, a, war, council, initially, he, considered, defending, from, the, city, center, but, later, decided, to, meet, the, enemy, in, open, battle, at, uhud, hill, following, the, insistence, of, the, younger, faction, of, his, followers, as, they, prepared, to, depart, the, remaining, jewish, allies, of, abdullah, ibn, ubayy, offered, their, help, which, muhammad, declined, despite, being, outnumbered, the, muslims, initially, held, their, ground, but, lost, advantage, when, some, archers, disobeyed, orders, as, rumors, of, muhammad, s, death, spread, the, muslims, started, to, flee, but, he, had, only, been, injured, and, managed, to, escape, with, a, group, of, loyal, adherents, satisfied, they, had, restored, their, honor, the, meccans, returned, to, mecca, mass, casualties, suffered, by, the, muslims, in, the, battle, of, uhud, resulted, in, many, wives, and, daughters, being, left, without, a, male, protector, so, after, the, battle, muhammad, received, revelation, allowing, muslim, men, to, have, up, to, four, wives, each, marking, the, beginning, of, polygyny, in, islam, sometime, later, muhammad, found, himself, needing, to, pay, blood, money, to, banu, amir, he, sought, monetary, help, from, the, jewish, tribe, of, banu, nadir, and, they, agreed, to, his, request, however, while, waiting, he, departed, from, his, companions, and, disappeared, when, they, found, him, at, his, home, according, to, ibn, ishaq, muhammad, disclosed, that, he, had, received, a, divine, revelation, of, a, planned, assassination, attempt, on, him, by, the, banu, nadir, which, involved, dropping, a, boulder, from, a, rooftop, muhammad, then, initiated, a, siege, on, the, tribe, during, this, time, he, also, commanded, the, felling, and, burning, of, their, palm, groves, which, was, an, unambiguous, symbol, of, declaring, war, in, arabia, after, a, fortnight, or, so, the, banu, nadir, capitulated, they, were, directed, to, vacate, their, land, and, permitted, to, carry, only, one, camel, load, of, goods, for, every, three, people, from, the, spoils, muhammad, claimed, a, fertile, piece, of, land, where, barley, sprouted, amongst, palm, trees, upon, receiving, a, report, that, the, banu, mustaliq, were, planning, an, attack, on, medina, muhammad, s, troops, executed, a, surprise, attack, on, them, at, their, watering, place, causing, them, to, flee, rapidly, in, the, confrontation, the, muslims, lost, one, man, while, the, enemy, suffered, ten, casualties, as, part, of, their, triumph, the, muslims, seized, 2, 000, camels, 500, sheep, and, goats, and, 200, women, from, the, tribe, the, muslim, soldiers, desired, the, captive, women, but, they, also, sought, ransom, money, they, asked, muhammad, about, using, coitus, interruptus, to, prevent, pregnancy, to, which, muhammad, replied, you, are, not, under, any, obligation, to, forbear, from, that, later, envoys, arrived, in, medina, to, negotiate, the, ransom, for, the, women, and, children, despite, having, the, choice, all, of, them, chose, to, return, to, their, country, instead, of, staying, with, the, help, of, the, exiled, banu, nadir, the, quraysh, military, leader, abu, sufyan, mustered, a, force, of, 10, 000, men, muhammad, prepared, a, force, of, about, 3, 000, men, and, adopted, a, form, of, defense, unknown, in, arabia, at, that, time, the, muslims, dug, a, trench, wherever, medina, lay, open, to, cavalry, attack, the, idea, is, credited, to, a, persian, convert, to, islam, salman, the, persian, the, siege, of, medina, began, on, 31, march, 627, and, lasted, two, weeks, abu, sufyan, s, troops, were, unprepared, for, the, fortifications, and, after, an, ineffectual, siege, the, coalition, decided, to, return, home, the, quran, discusses, this, battle, in, sura, al, ahzab, in, verses, 33, 9, 27, during, the, battle, the, jewish, tribe, of, banu, qurayza, located, to, the, south, of, medina, entered, into, negotiations, with, meccan, forces, to, revolt, against, muhammad, although, the, meccan, forces, were, swayed, by, suggestions, that, muhammad, was, sure, to, be, overwhelmed, they, desired, reassurance, in, case, the, confederacy, was, unable, to, destroy, him, no, agreement, was, reached, after, prolonged, negotiations, partly, due, to, sabotage, attempts, by, muhammad, s, scouts, after, the, coalition, s, retreat, the, muslims, accused, the, banu, qurayza, of, treachery, and, besieged, them, in, their, forts, for, 25, days, the, banu, qurayza, eventually, surrendered, according, to, ibn, ishaq, all, the, men, apart, from, a, few, converts, to, islam, were, beheaded, while, the, women, and, children, were, enslaved, walid, n, arafat, and, barakat, ahmad, have, disputed, the, accuracy, of, ibn, ishaq, s, narrative, arafat, believes, that, ibn, ishaq, s, jewish, sources, speaking, over, 100, years, after, the, event, conflated, this, account, with, memories, of, earlier, massacres, in, jewish, history, he, notes, that, ibn, ishaq, was, considered, an, unreliable, historian, by, his, contemporary, malik, ibn, anas, and, a, transmitter, of, odd, tales, by, the, later, ibn, hajar, ahmad, argues, that, only, some, of, the, tribe, were, killed, while, some, of, the, fighters, were, merely, enslaved, watt, finds, arafat, s, arguments, not, entirely, convincing, while, meir, j, kister, has, contradicted, the, arguments, of, arafat, and, ahmad, in, the, siege, of, medina, the, meccans, exerted, the, available, strength, to, destroy, the, muslim, community, the, failure, resulted, in, a, significant, loss, of, prestige, their, trade, with, syria, vanished, following, the, battle, of, the, trench, muhammad, made, two, expeditions, to, the, north, both, ended, without, any, fighting, while, returning, from, one, of, these, journeys, or, some, years, earlier, according, to, other, early, accounts, an, accusation, of, adultery, was, made, against, aisha, muhammad, s, wife, aisha, was, exonerated, from, accusations, when, muhammad, announced, he, had, received, a, revelation, confirming, aisha, s, innocence, and, directing, that, charges, of, adultery, be, supported, by, four, eyewitnesses, sura, 24, an, nur, on, the, exact, day, the, quraysh, forces, and, their, allies, withdrew, muhammad, while, bathing, at, his, wife, s, abode, received, a, visit, from, the, angel, gabriel, who, instructed, him, to, attack, the, jewish, tribe, of, banu, qurayza, islamic, sources, recount, that, during, the, preceding, meccan, siege, the, quraysh, leader, abu, sufyan, incited, the, qurayza, to, attack, the, muslims, from, their, compound, but, the, qurayza, demanded, the, quraysh, to, provide, 70, hostages, from, among, themselves, to, ascertain, their, commitment, to, their, plans, as, proposed, by, muhammad, s, secret, agent, nu, aym, ibn, mas, ud, abu, sufyan, refused, their, requirement, nevertheless, later, accounts, claim, that, 11, jewish, individuals, from, the, qurayza, were, indeed, agitated, and, acted, against, muhammad, though, the, course, of, event, may, have, been, dramatized, within, the, tradition, citing, the, intrigue, of, the, qurayza, muhammad, besieged, the, tribe, though, the, tribe, denied, the, charges, however, there, are, sources, that, say, the, banu, qurayza, broke, the, treaty, with, muhammad, and, assisted, the, enemies, of, muslims, during, the, battle, of, the, trench, as, the, situation, turned, against, the, qurayza, the, tribe, proposed, to, leave, their, land, with, one, loaded, camel, each, but, muhammad, refused, they, then, offered, to, leave, without, taking, anything, but, this, was, rejected, as, well, with, muhammad, insisting, on, their, unconditional, surrender, the, qurayza, subsequently, requested, to, confer, with, one, of, their, aws, allies, who, had, embraced, islam, leading, to, the, arrival, of, abu, lubaba, when, asked, about, muhammad, s, intentions, he, gestured, towards, his, throat, indicating, an, imminent, massacre, he, immediately, regretted, his, indiscretion, and, tied, himself, to, one, of, the, mosque, pillars, as, a, form, of, penance, after, a, 25, day, siege, the, banu, qurayza, surrendered, the, muslims, of, banu, aws, entreated, muhammad, for, leniency, prompting, him, to, suggest, that, one, of, their, own, should, serve, as, the, judge, which, they, accepted, muhammad, assigned, the, role, to, sa, d, ibn, muadh, a, man, nearing, death, from, an, infection, in, his, wounds, from, the, previous, meccan, siege, he, pronounced, that, all, the, men, should, be, put, to, death, their, possessions, to, be, distributed, among, muslims, and, their, women, and, children, to, be, taken, as, captives, muhammad, approved, this, pronouncement, saying, it, aligned, with, the, god, s, judgement, consequently, 600, 900, men, of, banu, qurayza, were, executed, the, women, and, children, were, distributed, as, slaves, with, some, being, transported, to, najd, to, be, sold, the, proceeds, were, then, utilized, to, purchase, weapons, and, horses, for, the, muslims, a, few, months, after, the, conflict, with, the, banu, qurayza, muhammad, organized, a, caravan, to, conduct, trade, in, syria, zayd, ibn, harithah, was, tasked, with, guarding, the, convoy, when, they, journeyed, through, the, territory, of, banu, fazara, whom, zayd, had, raided, in, the, past, the, tribe, seized, the, opportunity, for, revenge, attacking, the, caravan, and, injuring, him, upon, his, return, to, medina, muhammad, ordered, zayd, to, lead, a, punitive, operation, against, the, fazara, in, which, their, matriarch, umm, qirfa, was, captured, and, brutally, executed, early, in, 628, following, a, dream, of, making, an, unopposed, pilgrimage, to, mecca, muhammad, embarked, on, the, journey, he, was, dressed, in, his, customary, pilgrim, attire, and, was, accompanied, by, a, group, of, followers, upon, reaching, hudaybiyya, they, encountered, quraysh, emissaries, who, questioned, their, intentions, muhammad, explained, they, had, come, to, venerate, the, kaaba, not, to, fight, he, then, sent, uthman, abu, sufyan, s, second, cousin, to, negotiate, with, the, quraysh, as, the, negotiations, were, prolonged, rumors, of, uthman, s, death, began, to, spark, prompting, muhammad, to, call, his, followers, to, renew, their, oaths, of, loyalty, uthman, returned, with, news, of, a, negotiation, impasse, muhammad, remained, persistent, in, the, end, the, quraysh, sent, suhayl, ibn, amr, an, envoy, with, full, negotiation, powers, following, lengthy, discussions, a, treaty, was, finally, enacted, with, terms, roughly, ten, weeks, subsequent, to, his, return, from, hudaybiyya, muhammad, expressed, his, plan, to, invade, khaybar, a, flourishing, oasis, about, 75, miles, 121, km, north, of, medina, the, city, was, populated, by, jews, including, those, from, the, banu, nadir, who, had, previously, been, expelled, by, muhammad, from, medina, with, the, prospect, of, rich, spoils, from, the, mission, numerous, volunteers, answered, his, call, to, keep, their, movements, hidden, the, muslim, military, chose, to, march, during, the, nighttime, as, dawn, arrived, and, the, city, folks, stepped, out, of, their, fortifications, to, harvest, their, dates, they, were, taken, aback, by, the, sight, of, the, advancing, muslim, forces, muhammad, cried, out, allahu, akbar, khaybar, is, destroyed, for, when, we, approach, a, people, s, land, a, terrible, morning, awaits, the, warned, ones, after, a, strenuous, battle, lasting, more, than, a, month, the, muslims, successfully, captured, the, city, the, spoils, inclusive, of, the, wives, of, the, slain, warriors, were, distributed, among, the, muslims, the, chief, of, the, jews, kenana, ibn, al, rabi, to, whom, the, treasure, of, banu, al, nadir, was, entrusted, denied, knowing, its, whereabouts, after, a, jew, disclosed, his, habitual, presence, around, a, particular, ruin, muhammad, ordered, excavations, and, the, treasure, was, found, when, questioned, about, the, remaining, wealth, kenana, refused, to, divulge, it, kinana, was, then, put, through, torture, by, muhammad, s, decree, and, subsequently, beheaded, by, muhammad, ibn, maslama, in, revenge, for, his, brother, muhammad, took, kinana, s, wife, safiyya, bint, huyayy, as, his, own, slave, and, later, advised, her, to, convert, to, islam, she, accepted, and, agreed, to, become, muhammad, s, wife, following, their, defeat, by, the, muslims, some, of, the, jews, proposed, to, muhammad, that, they, stay, and, serve, as, tenant, farmers, given, the, muslims, lack, of, expertise, and, labor, force, for, date, palm, cultivation, they, agreed, to, give, half, of, the, annual, produce, to, the, muslims, muhammad, consented, to, this, arrangement, with, the, caveat, that, he, could, displace, them, at, any, time, while, they, were, allowed, to, farm, he, demanded, the, surrender, of, all, gold, or, silver, executing, those, who, secreted, away, their, wealth, taking, a, cue, from, what, transpired, in, khaybar, the, jews, in, fadak, immediately, sent, an, envoy, to, muhammad, and, agreed, to, the, same, terms, of, relinquishing, 50, of, their, annual, harvest, however, since, no, combat, occurred, the, rank, and, file, had, no, claim, to, a, portion, of, the, spoils, consequently, all, the, loot, became, muhammad, s, exclusive, wealth, at, the, feast, following, the, battle, the, meal, served, to, muhammad, was, reportedly, poisoned, his, companion, bishr, fell, dead, after, consuming, it, while, muhammad, himself, managed, to, vomit, it, out, after, tasting, it, the, perpetrator, was, zaynab, bint, al, harith, a, jewish, woman, whose, father, uncle, and, husband, had, been, killed, by, the, muslims, when, asked, why, she, did, it, she, replied, you, know, what, you, ve, done, to, my, people, i, said, to, myself, if, he, is, truly, a, prophet, he, will, know, about, the, poison, if, he, s, merely, a, king, i, ll, be, rid, of, him, muhammad, suffered, illness, for, a, period, due, to, the, poison, he, ingested, and, he, endured, sporadic, pain, from, it, until, his, death, the, truce, of, hudaybiyyah, was, enforced, for, two, years, the, tribe, of, banu, khuza, a, had, good, relations, with, muhammad, whereas, their, enemies, the, banu, bakr, had, allied, with, the, meccans, a,

also, took, part, in, the, fighting, after, this, event, muhammad, sent, a, message, to, mecca, with, three, conditions, asking, them, to, accept, one, of, them, these, were, either, the, meccans, would, pay, blood, money, for, the, slain, among, the, khuza, ah, tribe, they, disavow, themselves, of, the, banu, bakr, or, they, should, declare, the, truce, of, hudaybiyyah, null, the, meccans, replied, that, they, accepted, the, last, condition, soon, they, realized, their, mistake, and, sent, abu, sufyan, to, renew, the, hudaybiyyah, treaty, a, request, that, was, declined, by, muhammad, muhammad, began, to, prepare, for, a, campaign, in, 630, muhammad, marched, on, mecca, with, 10, 000, muslim, converts, with, minimal, casualties, muhammad, seized, control, of, mecca, he, declared,

were, later, pardoned, most, meccans, converted, to, islam, and, muhammad, proceeded, to, destroy, all, the, statues, of, arabian, gods, in, and, around, the, kaaba, according, to, reports, collected, by, ibn, ishaq, and, al, azraqi, muhammad, personally, spared, paintings, or, frescos, of, mary, and, jesus, but, other, traditions, suggest, that, all, pictures, were, erased, the, quran, discusses, the, conquest, of, mecca, upon, learning, that, mecca, had, fallen, to, the, muslims, the, banu, hawazin, gathered, their, entire, tribe, including, their, families, to, fight, they, are, estimated, to, have, around, 4, 000, warriors, muhammad, led, 12, 000, soldiers, to, raid, them, but, they, surprised, him, at, wadi, hunayn, the, muslims, overpowered, them, and, took, their, women, children, and, animals, muhammad, then, turned, his, attention, to, taif, a, city, that, was, famous, for, its, vineyards, and, gardens, he, ordered, them, to, be, destroyed, and, besieged, the, city, which, was, surrounded, by, walls, after, 15, 20, days, of, failing, to, breach, their, defenses, he, abandoned, the, attempts, when, he, divided, the, plentiful, loot, acquired, at, hunayn, among, his, soldiers, the, rest, of, the, hawazin, converted, to, islam, and, implored, muhammad, to, release, their, children, and, women, reminding, him, that, he, had, been, nursed, by, some, of, those, women, when, he, was, a, baby, he, complied, but, held, on, to, the, rest, of, the, plunder, some, of, his, men, opposed, giving, away, their, portions, so, he, compensated, them, with, six, camels, each, from, subsequent, raids, muhammad, distributed, a, big, portion, of, the, booty, to, the, new, converts, from, the, quraysh, abu, sufyan, and, two, of, his, sons, muawiyya, and, yazid, got, 100,

that, one, seeks, god, s, face, disturbed, by, this, utterance, muhammad, retorted, he, changed, color, roughly, 10, months, after, he, captured, mecca, muhammad, took, his, army, to, attack, the, wealthy, border, provinces, of, byzantine, syria, several, motives, are, proposed, including, avenging, the, defeat, at, mu, tah, and, earning, vast, booty, because, of, the, drought, and, severe, heat, at, that, time, some, of, the, muslims, refrained, from, participating, this, led, to, the, revelation, of, quran, 9, 38, which, rebuked, those, slackers, when, muhammad, and, his, army, reached, tabuk, there, were, no, hostile, forces, present, however, he, was, able, to, force, some, of, the, local, chiefs, to, accept, his, rule, and, pay, jizya, a, group, under, khalid, ibn, walid,

force, if, they, were, unfaithful, or, misbehaved, he, explained, that, wives, were, entrusted, to, their, husbands, and, if, obedient, deserved, to, be, provided, with, food, and, clothing, as, they,

came, to, he, inquired, about, it, and, they, explained, they, were, afraid, he, had, pleurisy, he, replied, that, god, would, not, afflict, him, with, such, a, vile, disease, and, ordered, all, the, women, to, also, take, the, remedy, according, to, various, sources, including, sahih, al, bukhari, muhammad, said, that, he, felt, his, aorta, being, severed, because, of, the, food, he, ate, at, khaybar, on, 8, june, 632, muhammad, died, in, his, last, moments, he, reportedly, uttered, o, god, forgive, me, and, have, mercy, on, me, and, let, me, join, the, highest, companions, historian,

since, the, hadith, prohibits, the, creation, of, images, of, sentient, living, beings, islamic, religious, art, mainly, focuses, on, the, word, muslims, generally, avoid, depictions, of, muhammad, and, instead, decorate, mosques, with, calligraphy, quranic, inscriptions, or, geometrical, designs, today, the, interdiction, against, images, of, muhammad, designed, to, prevent, worship, of, muhammad, rather, than, god, is, much, more, strictly, observed, in, sunni, islam, 85, 90, of, muslims, and, ahmadiyya, islam, 1, than, among, shias, 10, 15, while, both, sunnis, and, shias, have, created, images, of, muhammad, in, the, past, islamic, depictions, of, muhammad, are, rare, they, have, mostly, been, limited, to, the, private, and, elite, medium, of, the, miniature, and, since, about, 1500, most, depictions, show, muhammad, with, his, face, veiled, or, symbolically, represent, him, as, a, flame, the, earliest, extant, depictions, come, from, 13th, century, anatolian, seljuk, and, ilkhanid, persian, miniatures, typically, in, literary, genres, describing, the, life, and, deeds, of, muhammad, during, the, ilkhanid, period, when, persia, s, mongol, rulers, converted, to, islam, competing, sunni, and, shi, a, groups, used, visual, imagery, including, images, of, muhammad, to, promote, their, particular, interpretation, of, islam, s, key, events, influenced, by, the, buddhist, tradition, of, representational, religious, art, predating, the, mongol, elite, s, conversion, this, innovation, was, unprecedented, in, the, islamic, world, and, accompanied, by, a, broader, shift, in, islamic, artistic, culture, away, from, abstraction, toward, representation, in, mosques, on, tapestries, silks, ceramics, and, in, glass, and, metalwork, besides, books, in, the, persian, lands, this, tradition, of, realistic, depictions, lasted, through, the, timurid, dynasty, until, the, safavids, took, power, in, the, early, 16th, century, the, safavaids, who, made, shi, i, islam, the, state, religion, initiated, a, departure, from, the, traditional, ilkhanid, and, timurid, artistic, style, by, covering, muhammad, s, face, with, a, veil, to, obscure, his, features, and, at, the, same, time, represent, his, luminous, essence, concomitantly, some, of, the, unveiled, images, from, earlier, periods, were, defaced, later, images, were, produced, in, ottoman, turkey, and,

children, in, the, manner, of, graphic, novels, reproduced, through, lithography, these, were, essentially, printed, manuscripts, today, millions, of, historical, reproductions, and, modern, images, are, available, in, some, muslim, majority, countries, especially, turkey, and, iran, on, posters, postcards, and, even, in, coffee, table, books, but, are, unknown, in, most, other, parts, of, the, islamic, world, and, when, encountered, by, muslims, from, other, countries, they, can, cause, considerable, consternation, and, offense, according, to, william, montgomery, watt, religion, for, muhammad, was, not, a, private, and, individual, matter, but, the, total, response, of, his, personality, to, the, total, situation, in, which, he, found, himself, he, was, responding, to, the, religious, and, intellectual, aspects, of, the, situation, but, also, to, the, economic, social, and, political, pressures, to, which, contemporary, mecca, was, subject, bernard, lewis, says, there, are, two, important, political, traditions, in, islam, muhammad, as, a, statesman, in, medina, and, muhammad, as, a, rebel, in, mecca, in, his, view, islam, is, a, great, change, akin, to, a, revolution, when, introduced, to, new, societies, historians, generally, agree, that, islamic, social, changes, in, areas, such, as, social, security, family, structure, slavery, and, the, rights, of, women, and, children, improved, on, the, status, quo, of, arab, society, for, example, according, to, lewis, islam, from, the, first, denounced, aristocratic, privilege, rejected, hierarchy, and, adopted, a, formula, of, the, career, open, to, the, talents, muhammad, s, message, transformed, society, and, moral, orders, of, life, in, the, arabian, peninsula, society, focused, on, the, changes, to, perceived, identity, world, view, and, the, hierarchy, of, values, economic, reforms, addressed, the, plight, of, the, poor, which, was, becoming, an, issue, in, pre, islamic, mecca, the, quran, requires, payment, of, an, alms, tax, zakat, for, the, benefit, of, the, poor, as, muhammad, s, power, grew, he, demanded, that, tribes, who, wished, to, ally, with, him, implement, the, zakat, in, particular, guillaume, postel, was, among, the, first, to, present, a, more, positive, view, of, muhammad, when, he, argued, that, muhammad, should, be, esteemed, by, christians, as, a, valid, prophet, gottfried, leibniz, praised, muhammad, because, he, did, not, deviate, from, the, natural, religion, henri, de, boulainvilliers, in, his, vie, de, mahomed, which, was, published, posthumously, in, 1730, described, muhammad, as, a, gifted, political, leader, and, a, just, lawmaker, he, presents, him, as, a, divinely, inspired, messenger, whom, god, employed, to, confound, the, bickering, oriental, christians, to, liberate, the, orient, from, the, despotic, rule, of, the, romans, and, persians, and, to, spread, the, knowledge, of, the, unity, of, god, from, india, to, spain, voltaire, had, a, mixed, opinion, on, muhammad, in, his, play, le, fanatisme, ou, mahomet, le, proph, te, he, vilifies, muhammad, as, a, symbol, of, fanaticism, and, in, an, essay, in, 1748, he, calls, him, a, sublime, and, hearty, charlatan, but, in, voltaire, s, historical, survey, essai, sur, les, m, urs, he, presents, mohammed, as, a, legislator, and, conqueror, and, calls, him, an, enthusiast, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, his, social, contract, 1762, brushing, aside, hostile, legends, of, muhammad, as, a, trickster, and, impostor, presents, him, as, a, sage, legislator, who, wisely, fused, religious, and, political, powers, emmanuel, pastoret, published, in, 1787, his, zoroaster, confucius, and, muhammad, in, which, he, presents, the, lives, of, these, three, great, men, the, greatest, legislators, of, the, universe, and, compares, their, careers, as, religious, reformers, and, lawgivers, he, rejects, the, common, view, that, muhammad, is, an, impostor, and, argues, that, the, quran, proffers, the, most, sublime, truths, of, cult, and, morals, it, defines, the, unity, of, god, with, an, admirable, concision, pastoret, writes, that, the, common, accusations, of, his, immorality, are, unfounded, on, the, contrary, his, law, enjoins, sobriety, generosity, and, compassion, on, his, followers, the, legislator, of, arabia, was, a, great, man, napoleon, bonaparte, admired, muhammad, and, islam, and, described, him, as, a, model, lawmaker, and, conqueror, thomas, carlyle, in, his, book, on, heroes, hero, worship, the, heroic, in, history, 1841, describes, mahomet, as, a, silent, great, soul, he, was, one, of, those, who, cannot, but, be, in, earnest, carlyle, s, interpretation, has, been, widely, cited, by, muslim, scholars, as, a, demonstration, that, western, scholarship, validates, muhammad, s, status, as, a, great, man, in, history, ian, almond, says, that, german, romantic, writers, generally, held, positive, views, of, muhammad, goethe, s, extraordinary, poet, prophet, herder, s, nation, builder, schlegel, s, admiration, for, islam, as, an, aesthetic, product, enviably, authentic, radiantly, holistic, played, such, a, central, role, in, his, view, of, mohammed, as, an, exemplary, world, fashioner, that, he, even, used, it, as, a, scale, of, judgement, for, the, classical, the, dithyramb, we, are, told, has, to, radiate, pure, beauty, if, it, is, to, resemble, a, koran, of, poetry, after, quoting, heinrich, heine, who, said, in, a, letter, to, some, friend, that, i, must, admit, that, you, the, great, prophet, of, mecca, are, the, greatest, poet, and, that, your, quran, will, not, easily, escape, my, memory, john, tolan, goes, on, to, show, how, jews, in, europe, in, particular, held, more, nuanced, views, about, muhammad, and, islam, being, an, ethnoreligious, minority, feeling, discriminated, they, specifically, lauded, al, andalus, and, thus, writing, about, islam, was, for, jews, a, way, of, indulging, in, a, fantasy, world, far, from, the, persecution, and, pogroms, of, nineteenth, century, europe, where, jews, could, live, in, harmony, with, their, non, jewish, neighbors, recent, writers, such, as, william, montgomery, watt, and, richard, bell, dismiss, the, idea, that, muhammad, deliberately, deceived, his, followers, arguing, that, muhammad, was, absolutely, sincere, and, acted, in, complete, good, faith, and, muhammad, s, readiness, to, endure, hardship, for, his, cause, with, what, seemed, to, be, no, rational, basis, for, hope, shows, his, sincerity, watt, however, says, that, sincerity, does, not, directly, imply, correctness, in, contemporary, terms, muhammad, might, have, mistaken, his, subconscious, for, divine, revelation, watt, and, bernard, lewis, argue, that, viewing, muhammad, as, a, self, seeking, impostor, makes, it, impossible, to, understand, islam, s, development, alford, t, welch, holds, that, muhammad, was, able, to, be, so, influential, and, successful, because, of, his, firm, belief, in, his, vocation, criticism, of, muhammad, has, existed, since, the, 7th, century, when, muhammad, was, decried, by, his, non, muslim, arab, contemporaries, for, preaching, monotheism, and, by, the, jewish, tribes, of, arabia, for, his, perceived, appropriation, of, biblical, narratives, and, figures, and, proclamation, of, himself, as, the, seal, of, the, prophets, in, the, middle, ages, western, and, byzantine, labeled, him, a, false, prophet, the, antichrist, or, portrayed, him, as, a, heretic, as, he, was, frequently, portrayed, in, christendom, contemporary, criticism, involves, questioning, muhammad, s, legitimacy, as, a, prophet, his, moral, conduct, marriages, ownership, of, slaves, treatment, of, enemies, approach, to, doctrinal, matters, and, psychological, well, being, the, sunnah, contributed, much, to, the, development, of, islamic, law, particularly, from, the, end, of, the, first, islamic, century, muslim, mystics, known, as, sufis, who, were, seeking, for, the, inner, meaning, of, the, quran, and, the, inner, nature, of, muhammad, viewed, the, prophet, of, islam, not, only, as, a, prophet, but, also, as, a, perfect, human, being, all, sufi, orders, trace, their, chain, of, spiritual, descent, back, to, muhammad, some, notable, sufis, such, as, yusuf, abu, al, haggag, are, directly, descended, from, muhammad, followers, of, the, bah, faith, venerate, muhammad, as, one, of, a, number, of, prophets, or, manifestations, of, god, he, is, thought, to, be, the, final, manifestation, or, seal, of, the, adamic, cycle, but, consider, his, teachings, to, have, been, superseded, by, those, of, bah, u, ll, h, the, founder, of, the, bah, faith, and, the, first, manifestation, of, the, current, cycle, druze, tradition, honors, several, mentors, and, prophets, and, muhammad, is, considered, an, important, prophet, of, god, in, the, druze, faith, being, among, the, seven, prophets, who, appeared, in, different, periods, of, history
