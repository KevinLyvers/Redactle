the, end, of, the, german, empire, as, well, as, the, hohenzollern, dynasty, s, 300, year, rule, of, prussia, born, during, the, reign, of, his, granduncle, frederick, william, iv, of, prussia, wilhelm, was, the, son, of, prince, frederick, william, and, victoria, princess, royal, through, his, mother, he, was, the, eldest, of, the, 42, grandchildren, of, queen, victoria, of, the, united, kingdom, in, march, 1888, wilhelm, s, father, frederick, william, ascended, the, german, and, prussian, thrones, as, frederick, iii, frederick, died, just, 99, days, later, and, his, son, succeeded, him, as, wilhelm, ii, in, march, 1890, the, young, kaiser, dismissed, longtime, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, and, assumed, direct, control, over, his, nation, s, policies, embarking, on, a, bellicose, new, course, to, cement, germany, s, status, as, a, leading, world, power, over, the, course, of, his, reign, the, german, colonial, empire, acquired, new, territories, in, china, and, the, pacific, such, as, jiaozhou, bay, the, northern, mariana, islands, and, the, caroline, islands, and, became, europe, s, largest, manufacturer, however, wilhelm, often, undermined, such, progress, by, making, tactless, and, threatening, statements, towards, other, countries, without, first, consulting, his, ministers, likewise, his, regime, did, much, to, alienate, itself, from, other, great, powers, by, initiating, a, massive, naval, build, up, contesting, french, control, of, morocco, and, building, a, railway, through, baghdad, that, challenged, britain, s, dominion, in, the, persian, gulf, by, the, second, decade, of, the, 20th, century, germany, could, rely, only, on, significantly, weaker, nations, such, as, austria, hungary, and, the, declining, ottoman, empire, as, allies, despite, strengthening, germany, s, position, as, a, great, power, by, building, a, powerful, navy, as, well, as, promoting, scientific, innovation, within, its, borders, wilhelm, s, public, statements, and, erratic, foreign, policy, greatly, antagonized, the, international, community, and, are, considered, by, many, to, have, substantially, contributed, to, the, fall, of, the, german, empire, in, 1914, his, diplomatic, brinksmanship, culminated, in, germany, s, guarantee, of, military, support, to, austria, hungary, during, the, july, crisis, which, plunged, all, of, europe, into, world, war, i, a, lax, wartime, leader, wilhelm, left, virtually, all, decision, making, regarding, strategy, and, organisation, of, the, war, effort, to, the, german, supreme, army, command, by, august, 1916, this, broad, delegation, of, power, gave, rise, to, a, de, facto, military, dictatorship, that, dominated, the, country, s, policies, for, the, rest, of, the, conflict, despite, emerging, victorious, over, russia, and, obtaining, significant, territorial, gains, in, eastern, europe, germany, was, forced, to, relinquish, all, its, conquests, after, a, decisive, defeat, on, the, western, front, in, the, autumn, of, 1918, losing, the, support, of, his, country, s, military, and, many, of, his, subjects, wilhelm, was, forced, to, abdicate, during, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, which, converted, germany, into, an, unstable, democratic, state, known, as, the, weimar, republic, wilhelm, subsequently, fled, to, exile, in, the, netherlands, where, he, remained, during, its, occupation, by, nazi, germany, in, 1940, before, dying, there, in, 1941, wilhelm, was, born, in, berlin, on, 27, january, 1859, at, the, crown, prince, s, palace, to, victoria, princess, royal, vicky, and, prince, frederick, william, of, prussia, fritz, the, future, frederick, iii, his, mother, vicky, was, the, eldest, child, of, queen, victoria, of, the, united, kingdom, at, the, time, of, wilhelm, s, birth, his, granduncle, frederick, william, iv, was, king, of, prussia, frederick, william, iv, had, been, left, permanently, incapacitated, by, a, series, of, strokes, and, his, younger, brother, wilhelm, the, young, prince, s, grandfather, was, acting, as, regent, prince, wilhelm, was, the, oldest, of, the, 42, grandchildren, of, his, maternal, grandparents, queen, victoria, and, prince, albert, upon, the, death, of, frederick, william, iv, in, january, 1861, wilhelm, s, namesake, grandfather, became, king, and, the, two, year, old, wilhelm, became, second, in, the, line, of, succession, to, the, prussian, throne, after, 1871, wilhelm, also, became, second, in, the, line, to, the, newly, created, german, empire, which, according, to, the, constitution, of, the, german, empire, was, ruled, by, the, prussian, king, at, the, time, of, his, birth, he, was, also, sixth, in, the, line, of, succession, to, the, british, throne, after, his, maternal, uncles, and, his, mother, shortly, before, midnight, on, 26, january, 1859, princess, vicky, experienced, labour, pains, followed, by, her, water, breaking, after, which, dr, august, wegner, the, family, s, personal, physician, was, summoned, upon, examining, vicky, wegner, realised, the, infant, was, in, the, breech, position, gynaecologist, eduard, arnold, martin, was, then, sent, for, arriving, at, the, palace, at, 10, am, on, 27, january, after, administering, ipecac, and, prescribing, a, mild, dose, of, chloroform, which, was, administered, by, vicky, s, personal, physician, sir, james, clark, martin, advised, fritz, the, unborn, child, s, life, was, endangered, as, mild, anaesthesia, did, not, alleviate, her, extreme, labour, pains, resulting, in, her, horrible, screams, and, wails, clark, finally, administered, full, anaesthesia, observing, her, contractions, to, be, insufficiently, strong, martin, administered, a, dose, of, ergot, extract, and, at, 2, 45, pm, saw, the, infant, s, buttocks, emerging, from, the, birth, canal, but, noticed, the, pulse, in, the, umbilical, cord, was, weak, and, intermittent, despite, this, dangerous, sign, martin, ordered, a, further, heavy, dose, of, chloroform, so, he, could, better, manipulate, the, infant, observing, the, infant, s, legs, to, be, raised, upwards, and, his, left, arm, likewise, raised, upwards, and, behind, his, head, martin, carefully, eased, out, the, prince, s, legs, due, to, the, narrowness, of, the, birth, canal, he, then, forcibly, pulled, the, left, arm, downwards, tearing, the, brachial, plexus, then, continued, to, grasp, the, left, arm, to, rotate, the, infant, s, trunk, and, free, the, right, arm, likely, exacerbating, the, injury, after, completing, the, delivery, and, despite, realising, the, newborn, prince, was, hypoxic, martin, turned, his, attention, to, the, unconscious, vicky, noticing, after, some, minutes, that, the, newborn, remained, silent, martin, and, the, midwife, fr, ulein, stahl, worked, frantically, to, revive, the, prince, finally, despite, the, disapproval, of, those, present, stahl, spanked, the, newborn, vigorously, until, a, weak, cry, escaped, his, pale, lips, modern, medical, assessments, have, concluded, wilhelm, s, hypoxic, state, at, birth, due, to, the, breech, delivery, and, the, heavy, dosage, of, chloroform, left, him, with, minimal, to, mild, brain, damage, which, manifested, itself, in, his, subsequent, hyperactive, and, erratic, behaviour, limited, attention, span, and, impaired, social, abilities, the, brachial, plexus, injury, resulted, in, erb, s, palsy, which, left, wilhelm, with, a, withered, left, arm, about, six, inches, 15, centimetres, shorter, than, his, right, he, tried, with, some, success, to, conceal, this, many, photographs, show, him, holding, a, pair, of, white, gloves, in, his, left, hand, to, make, the, arm, seem, longer, in, others, he, holds, his, left, hand, with, his, right, has, his, disabled, arm, on, the, hilt, of, a, sword, or, holds, a, cane, to, give, the, illusion, of, a, useful, limb, posed, at, a, dignified, angle, historians, have, suggested, that, this, disability, affected, his, emotional, development, in, 1863, wilhelm, was, taken, to, england, to, be, present, at, the, wedding, of, his, uncle, bertie, and, princess, alexandra, of, denmark, later, king, edward, vii, and, queen, alexandra, wilhelm, attended, the, ceremony, in, a, highland, costume, complete, with, a, small, toy, dirk, during, the, ceremony, the, four, year, old, became, restless, his, 18, year, old, uncle, prince, alfred, charged, with, keeping, an, eye, on, him, told, him, to, be, quiet, but, wilhelm, drew, his, dirk, and, threatened, alfred, when, alfred, attempted, to, subdue, him, by, force, wilhelm, bit, him, on, the, leg, his, grandmother, queen, victoria, missed, seeing, the, fracas, to, her, wilhelm, remained, a, clever, dear, good, little, child, the, great, favourite, of, my, beloved, vicky, vicky, was, obsessed, with, her, son, s, damaged, arm, blaming, herself, for, the, child, s, handicap, and, insisted, that, he, become, a, good, rider, the, thought, that, wilhelm, as, heir, to, the, throne, should, not, be, able, to, ride, was, intolerable, to, her, riding, lessons, began, when, wilhelm, was, eight, and, were, a, matter, of, endurance, for, him, over, and, over, the, weeping, prince, was, set, on, his, horse, and, compelled, to, go, through, the, paces, he, fell, off, time, after, time, but, despite, his, tears, was, set, on, its, back, again, after, weeks, of, this, he, was, finally, able, to, maintain, his, balance, wilhelm, from, six, years, of, age, was, tutored, and, heavily, influenced, by, the, 39, year, old, teacher, georg, ernst, hinzpeter, hinzpeter, he, later, wrote, was, really, a, good, fellow, whether, he, was, the, right, tutor, for, me, i, dare, not, decide, the, torments, inflicted, on, me, in, this, pony, riding, must, be, attributed, to, my, mother, as, a, teenager, wilhelm, was, educated, at, kassel, at, the, friedrichsgymnasium, in, january, 1877, wilhelm, finished, high, school, and, on, his, eighteenth, birthday, received, as, a, present, from, his, grandmother, the, order, of, the, garter, after, kassel, he, spent, four, terms, at, the, university, of, bonn, studying, law, and, politics, he, became, a, member, of, the, exclusive, corps, borussia, bonn, wilhelm, possessed, a, quick, intelligence, but, this, was, often, overshadowed, by, a, cantankerous, temper, as, a, scion, of, the, royal, house, of, hohenzollern, wilhelm, was, exposed, from, an, early, age, to, the, military, society, of, the, prussian, aristocracy, this, had, a, major, impact, on, him, and, in, maturity, wilhelm, was, seldom, seen, out, of, uniform, the, hyper, masculine, military, culture, of, prussia, in, this, period, did, much, to, frame, his, political, ideals, and, personal, relationships, wilhelm, was, in, awe, of, his, father, whose, status, as, a, hero, of, the, wars, of, unification, was, largely, responsible, for, the, young, wilhelm, s, attitude, as, were, the, circumstances, in, which, he, was, raised, close, emotional, contact, between, father, and, son, was, not, encouraged, later, as, he, came, into, contact, with, the, crown, prince, s, political, opponents, wilhelm, came, to, adopt, more, ambivalent, feelings, toward, his, father, perceiving, the, influence, of, wilhelm, s, mother, over, a, figure, who, should, have, been, possessed, of, masculine, independence, and, strength, wilhelm, also, idolised, his, grandfather, wilhelm, i, and, he, was, instrumental, in, later, attempts, to, foster, a, cult, of, the, first, german, emperor, as, wilhelm, the, great, however, he, had, a, distant, relationship, with, his, mother, wilhelm, resisted, attempts, by, his, parents, especially, his, mother, to, educate, him, in, a, spirit, of, british, liberalism, instead, he, agreed, with, his, tutors, support, of, autocratic, rule, and, gradually, became, thoroughly, prussianized, under, their, influence, he, thus, became, alienated, from, his, parents, suspecting, them, of, putting, britain, s, interests, first, the, german, emperor, wilhelm, i, watched, as, his, grandson, guided, principally, by, the, crown, princess, victoria, grew, to, manhood, when, wilhelm, was, nearing, 21, the, emperor, decided, it, was, time, his, grandson, should, begin, the, military, phase, of, his, preparation, for, the, throne, he, was, assigned, as, a, lieutenant, to, the, first, regiment, of, foot, guards, stationed, at, potsdam, in, the, guards, wilhelm, said, i, really, found, my, family, my, friends, my, interests, everything, of, which, i, had, up, to, that, time, had, to, do, without, as, a, boy, and, a, student, his, manner, had, been, polite, and, agreeable, as, an, officer, he, began, to, strut, and, speak, brusquely, in, the, tone, he, deemed, appropriate, for, a, prussian, officer, when, wilhelm, was, in, his, early, twenties, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, tried, to, separate, him, from, his, parents, who, opposed, bismarck, and, his, policies, with, some, success, bismarck, planned, to, use, the, young, prince, as, a, weapon, against, his, parents, in, order, to, retain, his, own, political, dominance, wilhelm, thus, developed, a, dysfunctional, relationship, with, his, parents, but, especially, with, his, english, mother, in, an, outburst, in, april, 1889, wilhelm, angrily, implied, that, an, english, doctor, killed, my, father, and, an, english, doctor, crippled, my, arm, which, is, the, fault, of, my, mother, who, allowed, no, german, physicians, to, attend, to, herself, or, her, immediate, family, as, a, young, man, wilhelm, fell, in, love, with, one, of, his, maternal, first, cousins, princess, elisabeth, of, hesse, darmstadt, she, turned, him, down, and, in, time, married, into, the, russian, imperial, family, in, 1880, wilhelm, became, engaged, to, princess, augusta, victoria, of, schleswig, holstein, known, as, dona, the, couple, married, on, 27, february, 1881, and, their, marriage, lasted, 40, years, until, her, death, in, 1921, between, 1882, and, 1892, augusta, bore, wilhelm, seven, children, six, sons, and, a, daughter, beginning, in, 1884, bismarck, began, advocating, that, kaiser, wilhelm, send, his, grandson, on, diplomatic, missions, a, privilege, denied, to, the, crown, prince, that, year, prince, wilhelm, was, sent, to, the, court, of, tsar, alexander, iii, of, russia, in, st, petersburg, to, attend, the, coming, of, age, ceremony, of, the, 16, year, old, tsarevich, nicholas, wilhelm, s, behaviour, did, little, to, ingratiate, himself, to, the, tsar, two, years, later, kaiser, wilhelm, i, took, prince, wilhelm, on, a, trip, to, meet, with, emperor, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, hungary, in, 1886, also, thanks, to, herbert, von, bismarck, the, son, of, the, chancellor, prince, wilhelm, began, to, be, trained, twice, a, week, at, the, foreign, ministry, kaiser, wilhelm, i, died, in, berlin, on, 9, march, 1888, and, prince, wilhelm, s, father, ascended, the, throne, as, frederick, iii, he, was, already, experiencing, an, incurable, throat, cancer, and, spent, all, 99, days, of, his, reign, fighting, the, disease, before, dying, on, 15, june, of, that, same, year, his, 29, year, old, son, succeeded, him, as, german, emperor, and, king, of, prussia, although, in, his, youth, he, had, been, a, great, admirer, of, otto, von, bismarck, wilhelm, s, characteristic, impatience, soon, brought, him, into, conflict, with, the, iron, chancellor, the, dominant, figure, in, the, foundation, of, his, empire, the, new, emperor, opposed, bismarck, s, careful, foreign, policy, preferring, vigorous, and, rapid, expansion, to, protect, germany, s, place, in, the, sun, furthermore, the, young, emperor, had, come, to, the, throne, unlike, his, grandfather, determined, to, rule, as, well, as, reign, while, the, imperial, constitution, vested, executive, power, in, the, monarch, wilhelm, i, had, been, content, to, leave, day, to, day, administration, to, bismarck, early, conflicts, between, wilhelm, ii, and, his, chancellor, soon, poisoned, the, relationship, between, the, two, men, bismarck, had, believed, that, wilhelm, was, a, lightweight, who, could, be, dominated, and, he, showed, escalating, disrespect, for, wilhelm, s, favored, policy, objectives, in, the, late, 1880s, the, final, split, between, monarch, and, statesman, occurred, soon, after, an, attempt, by, bismarck, to, implement, far, reaching, anti, socialist, laws, in, early, 1890, according, to, adherents, of, the, bismarck, myth, the, young, kaiser, rejected, the, iron, chancellor, s, allegedly, peaceful, foreign, policy, and, instead, plotted, with, senior, generals, to, work, in, favour, of, a, war, of, aggression, bismarck, himself, once, complained, to, an, aide, that, young, man, wants, war, with, russia, and, would, like, to, draw, his, sword, straight, away, if, he, could, i, shall, not, be, a, party, to, it, but, the, origin, of, bismarck, s, dismissal, lies, in, home, affairs, after, gaining, an, absolute, majority, in, the, reichstag, he, formed, the, kartell, a, coalition, government, of, the, german, conservative, party, and, the, national, liberal, party, they, favoured, making, the, anti, socialist, laws, permanent, with, one, exception, giving, the, german, police, the, power, similarly, to, the, tsarist, okhrana, to, expel, alleged, socialist, agitators, from, their, homes, by, decree, and, into, internal, exile, even, old, liberal, statesman, eugen, richter, the, author, of, the, famous, 1891, dystopian, novel, pictures, of, the, socialistic, future, opposed, banning, the, social, democratic, party, outright, and, said, i, fear, social, democracy, more, under, this, law, than, without, it, the, kartell, split, over, this, issue, and, the, law, was, not, passed, as, the, debate, continued, wilhelm, became, more, and, more, interested, in, the, social, problems, being, exploited, in, the, propaganda, of, the, socialists, especially, the, treatment, of, mine, workers, who, went, on, strike, in, 1889, he, routinely, disagreed, with, bismarck, during, cabinet, meetings, bismarck, in, turn, sharply, disagreed, with, wilhelm, s, pro, labor, union, policies, and, worked, to, circumvent, them, bismarck, feeling, unappreciated, by, the, young, emperor, and, by, his, ambitious, advisors, once, refused, to, co, sign, a, proclamation, regarding, the, protection, of, industrial, workers, as, was, required, by, the, german, constitution, and, prevented, it, from, being, made, law, while, bismarck, had, previously, sponsored, landmark, social, security, legislation, by, 1889, 90, he, had, become, violently, opposed, to, the, rise, of, organized, labor, in, particular, he, was, opposed, to, wage, increases, improving, working, conditions, and, regulating, labour, relations, the, final, break, between, the, iron, chancellor, and, the, kaiser, came, when, bismarck, initiated, discussions, with, the, opposition, to, form, a, new, parliamentary, majority, without, consulting, with, wilhelm, first, the, kartell, the, shifting, coalition, government, that, bismarck, had, been, able, to, maintain, since, 1867, had, finally, lost, its, majority, of, seats, in, the, reichstag, due, to, the, anti, socialist, laws, fiasco, the, remaining, powers, in, the, reichstag, were, the, catholic, centre, party, and, the, conservative, party, in, most, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, government, depends, upon, the, confidence, of, the, parliamentary, majority, and, has, the, right, to, form, coalitions, to, maintain, a, majority, of, supporters, in, a, constitutional, monarchy, however, the, chancellor, is, required, to, meet, regularly, with, the, monarch, to, explain, his, or, her, policies, and, intentions, within, the, government, a, chancellor, in, a, constitutional, monarchy, also, cannot, afford, to, make, an, enemy, of, the, monarch, who, represents, the, only, real, check, and, balance, against, a, chancellor, s, otherwise, absolute, power, this, is, because, a, constitutional, monarch, has, plenty, of, means, at, his, or, her, disposal, of, quietly, blocking, a, chancellor, s, policy, objectives, and, is, one, of, the, only, people, who, can, forcibly, remove, an, overly, ambitious, chancellor, from, power, for, these, reasons, the, last, kaiser, believed, that, he, had, every, right, to, be, informed, before, bismarck, began, coalition, talks, with, the, opposition, in, a, deeply, ironic, moment, a, mere, decade, after, demonizing, all, members, of, the, catholic, church, in, germany, as, german, reichsfeinde, traitors, to, the, empire, during, the, kulturkampf, bismarck, decided, to, start, coalition, talks, with, the, all, catholic, centre, party, he, invited, that, party, s, leader, in, the, reichstag, baron, ludwig, von, windthorst, to, meet, with, him, and, begin, the, negotiations, the, kaiser, who, always, had, a, warm, relationship, with, baron, von, windthorst, whose, decades, long, defence, of, german, catholics, poles, jews, and, other, minorities, against, the, iron, chancellor, have, since, attracted, comparisons, to, irish, nationalist, statesmen, daniel, o, connell, and, charles, stewart, parnell, was, furious, to, hear, about, bismarck, s, plans, for, coalition, talks, with, the, centre, party, only, after, they, had, already, begun, after, a, heated, argument, at, bismarck, s, estate, over, the, latter, s, alleged, disrespect, for, the, imperial, family, wilhelm, stormed, out, bismarck, forced, for, the, first, time, in, his, career, into, a, crisis, that, he, could, not, twist, to, his, own, advantage, wrote, a, blistering, letter, of, resignation, decrying, the, monarchy, s, involvement, in, both, foreign, and, domestic, policy, the, letter, was, published, only, after, bismarck, s, death, in, later, years, bismarck, created, the, bismarck, myth, the, view, which, some, historians, have, argued, was, confirmed, by, subsequent, events, that, wilhelm, ii, s, successful, demand, for, bismarck, s, resignation, destroyed, any, chance, imperial, germany, ever, had, of, stable, government, and, international, peace, according, to, this, view, what, wilhelm, termed, the, new, course, is, characterised, as, germany, s, ship, of, state, going, dangerously, off, course, leading, directly, to, the, carnage, of, the, first, and, second, world, wars, according, to, bismarck, apologists, in, foreign, policy, the, iron, chancellor, had, achieved, a, fragile, balance, of, interests, between, germany, france, and, russia, peace, was, allegedly, at, hand, and, bismarck, tried, to, keep, it, that, way, despite, growing, popular, sentiment, against, britain, regarding, the, german, colonial, empire, and, especially, against, russia, with, bismarck, s, dismissal, the, russians, allegedly, expected, a, reversal, of, policy, in, berlin, so, they, quickly, negotiated, a, military, alliance, with, the, third, french, republic, beginning, a, process, that, by, 1914, largely, isolated, germany, in, contrast, historian, modris, eksteins, has, argued, that, bismarck, s, dismissal, was, actually, long, overdue, according, to, eksteins, the, iron, chancellor, in, his, need, for, a, scapegoat, had, demonized, classical, liberals, in, the, 1860s, roman, catholics, in, the, 1870s, and, socialists, in, the, 1880s, with, the, highly, successful, and, often, repeated, refrain, the, reich, is, in, danger, therefore, in, order, to, divide, and, rule, bismarck, ultimately, left, the, german, people, even, more, divided, in, 1890, than, they, had, ever, been, before, 1871, in, interviews, with, c, l, sulzberger, for, the, book, the, fall, of, eagles, prince, louis, ferdinand, of, prussia, grandson, and, heir, of, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, further, commented, bismarck, was, certainly, our, greatest, statesman, but, he, had, very, bad, manners, and, he, became, increasingly, overbearing, with, age, frankly, i, don, t, think, his, dismissal, by, my, grandfather, was, a, great, tragedy, russia, was, already, on, the, other, side, because, of, the, berlin, congress, of, 1878, had, bismarck, stayed, he, would, not, have, helped, he, already, wanted, to, abolish, all, the, reforms, that, had, been, introduced, he, was, aspiring, to, establish, a, kind, of, shogunate, and, hoped, to, treat, our, family, in, the, same, way, the, japanese, shoguns, treated, the, japanese, emperors, isolated, in, kyoto, my, grandfather, had, no, choice, but, to, dismiss, him, bismarck, was, succeeded, as, chancellor, of, germany, and, minister, president, of, prussia, by, leo, von, caprivi, at, the, opening, of, the, reichstag, on, 6, may, 1890, the, kaiser, stated, that, the, most, pressing, issue, was, the, further, enlargement, of, the, bill, concerning, the, protection, of, the, labourer, in, 1891, the, reichstag, passed, the, workers, protection, acts, which, improved, working, conditions, protected, women, and, children, and, regulated, labour, relations, caprivi, in, turn, was, replaced, by, chlodwig, von, hohenlohe, schillingsf, rst, in, 1894, following, the, dismissal, of, hohenlohe, in, 1900, wilhelm, appointed, the, man, whom, he, regarded, as, his, own, bismarck, bernhard, von, b, low, in, appointing, caprivi, and, then, hohenlohe, wilhelm, was, embarking, upon, what, is, known, to, history, as, the, new, course, in, which, he, hoped, to, exert, decisive, influence, in, the, government, of, the, empire, there, is, debate, amongst, historians, as, to, the, precise, degree, to, which, wilhelm, succeeded, in, implementing, personal, rule, in, this, era, but, what, is, clear, is, the, very, different, dynamic, which, existed, between, the, crown, and, its, chief, political, servant, the, chancellor, in, the, wilhelmine, era, these, chancellors, were, senior, civil, servants, and, not, seasoned, politician, statesmen, like, bismarck, wilhelm, wanted, to, preclude, the, emergence, of, another, iron, chancellor, whom, he, ultimately, detested, as, being, a, boorish, old, killjoy, who, had, not, permitted, any, minister, to, see, the, emperor, except, in, his, presence, keeping, a, stranglehold, on, effective, political, power, upon, his, enforced, retirement, and, until, his, dying, day, bismarck, became, a, bitter, critic, of, wilhelm, s, policies, but, without, gaining, the, support, of, a, majority, within, the, reichstag, there, was, little, chance, of, bismarck, exerting, a, decisive, influence, on, policy, in, the, early, twentieth, century, wilhelm, began, to, concentrate, upon, his, real, agenda, the, creation, of, a, german, navy, that, would, rival, that, of, britain, and, enable, germany, to, declare, itself, a, world, power, the, last, kaiser, ordered, the, high, command, of, the, armed, forces, to, read, united, states, navy, admiral, alfred, thayer, mahan, s, book, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, and, spent, hours, drawing, sketches, of, the, ships, that, he, dreamed, of, having, built, b, low, and, bethmann, hollweg, his, loyal, chancellors, looked, after, domestic, affairs, while, wilhelm, obliviously, began, to, spread, alarm, in, the, chancelleries, of, europe, with, his, increasingly, eccentric, and, ill, advised, statements, on, foreign, affairs, wilhelm, enthusiastically, promoted, the, arts, and, sciences, as, well, as, public, education, and, social, welfare, he, sponsored, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, for, the, promotion, of, scientific, research, it, was, funded, by, wealthy, private, donors, and, by, the, state, and, comprised, a, number, of, research, institutes, in, both, pure, and, applied, sciences, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, was, unable, to, avoid, the, kaiser, s, pressure, and, lost, some, of, its, autonomy, when, it, was, forced, to, incorporate, new, programs, in, engineering, and, award, new, fellowships, in, engineering, sciences, as, a, result, of, a, gift, from, the, kaiser, in, 1900, wilhelm, supported, the, modernisers, as, they, tried, to, reform, the, prussian, system, of, secondary, education, which, was, rigidly, traditional, elitist, politically, authoritarian, and, unchanged, by, the, progress, in, the, natural, sciences, as, hereditary, protector, of, the, order, of, saint, john, he, offered, encouragement, to, the, christian, order, s, attempts, to, place, german, medicine, at, the, forefront, of, modern, medical, practice, through, its, system, of, hospitals, nursing, sisterhood, and, nursing, schools, and, nursing, homes, throughout, the, german, empire, wilhelm, continued, as, protector, of, the, order, even, after, 1918, as, the, position, was, in, essence, attached, to, the, head, of, the, house, of, hohenzollern, historians, have, frequently, stressed, the, role, of, wilhelm, s, personality, in, shaping, his, reign, thus, thomas, nipperdey, concludes, he, was, gifted, with, a, quick, understanding, sometimes, brilliant, with, a, taste, for, the, modern, technology, industry, science, but, at, the, same, time, superficial, hasty, restless, unable, to, relax, without, any, deeper, level, of, seriousness, without, any, desire, for, hard, work, or, drive, to, see, things, through, to, the, end, without, any, sense, of, sobriety, for, balance, and, boundaries, or, even, for, reality, and, real, problems, uncontrollable, and, scarcely, capable, of, learning, from, experience, desperate, for, applause, and, success, as, bismarck, said, early, on, in, his, life, he, wanted, every, day, to, be, his, birthday, romantic, sentimental, and, theatrical, unsure, and, arrogant, with, an, immeasurably, exaggerated, self, confidence, and, desire, to, show, off, a, juvenile, cadet, who, never, took, the, tone, of, the, officers, mess, out, of, his, voice, and, brashly, wanted, to, play, the, part, of, the, supreme, warlord, full, of, panicky, fear, of, a, monotonous, life, without, any, diversions, and, yet, aimless, pathological, in, his, hatred, against, his, english, mother, historian, david, fromkin, states, that, wilhelm, had, a, love, hate, relationship, with, britain, according, to, fromkin, from, the, outset, the, half, german, side, of, him, was, at, war, with, the, half, english, side, he, was, wildly, jealous, of, the, british, wanting, to, be, british, wanting, to, be, better, at, being, british, than, the, british, were, while, at, the, same, time, hating, them, and, resenting, them, because, he, never, could, be, fully, accepted, by, them, langer, et, al, 1968, emphasise, the, negative, international, consequences, of, wilhelm, s, erratic, personality, he, believed, in, force, and, the, survival, of, the, fittest, in, domestic, as, well, as, foreign, politics, william, was, not, lacking, in, intelligence, but, he, did, lack, stability, disguising, his, deep, insecurities, by, swagger, and, tough, talk, he, frequently, fell, into, depressions, and, hysterics, william, s, personal, instability, was, reflected, in, vacillations, of, policy, his, actions, at, home, as, well, as, abroad, lacked, guidance, and, therefore, often, bewildered, or, infuriated, public, opinion, he, was, not, so, much, concerned, with, gaining, specific, objectives, as, had, been, the, case, with, bismarck, as, with, asserting, his, will, this, trait, in, the, ruler, of, the, leading, continental, power, was, one, of, the, main, causes, of, the, uneasiness, prevailing, in, europe, at, the, turn, of, the, century, as, a, grandchild, of, queen, victoria, wilhelm, was, a, first, cousin, of, king, george, v, of, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, of, queens, marie, of, romania, maud, of, norway, victoria, eugenie, of, spain, and, empress, alexandra, of, russia, in, 1889, wilhelm, s, younger, sister, sophia, married, constantine, crown, prince, of, greece, wilhelm, was, infuriated, by, his, sister, s, conversion, from, lutheranism, to, greek, orthodoxy, upon, her, marriage, he, attempted, to, ban, her, from, entering, germany, wilhelm, s, most, contentious, relationships, were, with, his, british, relations, he, craved, the, acceptance, of, his, grandmother, queen, victoria, and, of, the, rest, of, her, family, despite, the, fact, that, his, grandmother, treated, him, with, courtesy, and, tact, his, other, relatives, largely, denied, him, acceptance, he, had, an, especially, bad, relationship, with, his, uncle, bertie, later, edward, vii, between, 1888, and, 1901, wilhelm, resented, bertie, who, despite, being, the, heir, apparent, to, the, british, throne, treated, wilhelm, not, as, a, reigning, monarch, but, merely, as, another, nephew, in, turn, wilhelm, often, snubbed, his, uncle, whom, he, referred, to, as, the, old, peacock, and, lorded, his, position, as, emperor, over, him, beginning, in, the, 1890s, wilhelm, made, visits, to, england, for, cowes, week, on, the, isle, of, wight, and, often, competed, against, his, uncle, in, the, yacht, races, bertie, s, wife, alexandra, also, disliked, wilhelm, even, though, wilhelm, had, not, been, on, the, throne, at, the, time, alexandra, felt, anger, over, the, prussian, seizure, of, schleswig, holstein, from, her, native, denmark, in, the, 1860s, and, was, also, annoyed, over, wilhelm, s, treatment, of, his, mother, despite, his, poor, relations, with, his, english, relatives, when, he, received, news, that, queen, victoria, was, dying, at, osborne, house, in, january, 1901, wilhelm, travelled, to, england, and, was, at, her, bedside, when, she, died, and, he, remained, for, the, funeral, he, also, was, present, at, the, funeral, of, king, edward, vii, in, 1910, in, 1913, wilhelm, hosted, a, lavish, wedding, in, berlin, for, his, only, daughter, victoria, louise, among, the, guests, at, the, wedding, were, his, cousins, tsar, nicholas, ii, of, russia, and, king, george, v, of, the, united, kingdom, and, george, s, wife, queen, mary, german, foreign, policy, under, wilhelm, ii, was, faced, with, a, number, of, significant, problems, perhaps, the, most, apparent, was, that, wilhelm, was, an, impatient, man, subjective, in, his, reactions, and, affected, strongly, by, sentiment, and, impulse, he, was, personally, ill, equipped, to, steer, german, foreign, policy, along, a, rational, course, there, were, a, number, of, examples, such, as, the, kruger, telegram, of, 1896, in, which, wilhelm, congratulated, president, paul, kruger, for, preventing, the, transvaal, republic, from, being, annexed, by, the, british, empire, during, the, jameson, raid, british, public, opinion, had, been, quite, favourable, towards, the, kaiser, in, his, first, twelve, years, on, the, throne, but, it, turned, sour, in, the, late, 1890s, during, the, first, world, war, he, became, the, central, target, of, british, anti, german, propaganda, and, the, personification, of, a, hated, enemy, wilhelm, exploited, fears, of, a, yellow, peril, trying, to, interest, other, european, rulers, in, the, perils, they, faced, by, invading, china, few, other, leaders, paid, attention, wilhelm, also, used, the, japanese, victory, in, the, russo, japanese, war, to, try, to, incite, fear, in, the, west, of, the, yellow, peril, that, they, faced, by, a, resurgent, imperial, japan, which, wilhelm, claimed, would, ally, with, china, to, overrun, the, conventional, european, powers, wilhelm, also, invested, in, strengthening, the, german, colonial, empire, in, africa, and, the, pacific, but, few, became, profitable, and, all, were, lost, during, the, first, world, war, in, south, west, africa, now, namibia, a, native, revolt, against, german, rule, led, to, the, herero, and, namaqua, genocide, although, wilhelm, eventually, ordered, it, to, be, stopped, and, recalled, its, mastermind, general, lothar, von, trotha, one, of, the, few, times, when, wilhelm, succeeded, in, personal, diplomacy, was, when, in, 1900, he, supported, the, morganatic, marriage, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, of, austria, to, countess, sophie, chotek, and, helped, negotiate, an, end, to, the, opposition, to, the, wedding, by, emperor, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, a, domestic, triumph, for, wilhelm, was, when, his, daughter, victoria, louise, married, the, duke, of, brunswick, in, 1913, this, helped, heal, the, rift, between, the, house, of, hanover, and, the, house, of, hohenzollern, that, had, followed, bismarck, s, invasion, and, annexation, of, the, kingdom, of, hanover, in, 1866, in, his, first, visit, to, constantinople, in, 1889, wilhelm, secured, the, sale, of, german, made, rifles, to, the, ottoman, army, later, on, he, had, his, second, political, visit, to, the, ottoman, empire, as, a, guest, of, sultan, abdulhamid, ii, the, kaiser, started, his, journey, to, the, ottoman, eyalets, with, constantinople, on, 16, october, 1898, then, he, went, by, yacht, to, haifa, on, 25, october, after, visiting, jerusalem, and, bethlehem, the, kaiser, went, back, to, jaffa, to, embark, to, beirut, where, he, took, the, train, passing, aley, and, zahl, to, reach, damascus, on, 7, november, while, visiting, the, mausoleum, of, saladin, the, following, day, the, kaiser, made, a, speech, in, the, face, of, all, the, courtesies, extended, to, us, here, i, feel, that, i, must, thank, you, in, my, name, as, well, as, that, of, the, empress, for, them, for, the, hearty, reception, given, us, in, all, the, towns, and, cities, we, have, touched, and, particularly, for, the, splendid, welcome, extended, to, us, by, this, city, of, damascus, deeply, moved, by, this, imposing, spectacle, and, likewise, by, the, consciousness, of, standing, on, the, spot, where, held, sway, one, of, the, most, chivalrous, rulers, of, all, times, the, great, sultan, saladin, a, knight, sans, peur, et, sans, reproche, who, often, taught, his, adversaries, the, right, conception, of, knighthood, i, seize, with, joy, the, opportunity, to, render, thanks, above, all, to, the, sultan, abdul, hamid, for, his, hospitality, may, the, sultan, rest, assured, and, also, the, three, hundred, million, mohammedans, scattered, over, the, globe, and, revering, in, him, their, caliph, that, the, german, emperor, will, be, and, remain, at, all, times, their, friend, on, 10, november, wilhelm, went, to, visit, baalbek, before, heading, to, beirut, to, board, his, ship, back, home, on, 12, november, in, his, second, visit, wilhelm, secured, a, promise, for, german, companies, to, construct, the, berlin, baghdad, railway, and, had, the, german, fountain, constructed, in, constantinople, to, commemorate, his, journey, his, third, visit, was, on, 15, october, 1917, as, the, guest, of, sultan, mehmed, v, the, boxer, rebellion, an, anti, foreign, uprising, in, china, was, put, down, in, 1900, by, an, international, force, known, as, the, eight, nation, alliance, the, kaiser, s, farewell, address, to, departing, german, soldiers, commanded, them, in, the, spirit, of, the, huns, to, be, merciless, in, battle, wilhelm, s, fiery, rhetoric, clearly, expressed, his, vision, for, germany, as, one, of, the, great, powers, there, were, two, versions, of, the, speech, the, german, foreign, office, issued, an, edited, version, making, sure, to, omit, one, particularly, incendiary, paragraph, that, they, regarded, as, diplomatically, embarrassing, the, edited, version, was, this, great, overseas, tasks, have, fallen, to, the, new, german, empire, tasks, far, greater, than, many, of, my, countrymen, expected, the, german, empire, has, by, its, very, character, the, obligation, to, assist, its, citizens, if, they, are, being, set, upon, in, foreign, lands, a, great, task, awaits, you, you, are, to, revenge, the, grievous, injustice, that, has, been, done, the, chinese, have, overturned, the, law, of, nations, they, have, mocked, the, sacredness, of, the, envoy, the, duties, of, hospitality, in, a, way, unheard, of, in, world, history, it, is, all, the, more, outrageous, that, this, crime, has, been, committed, by, a, nation, that, takes, pride, in, its, ancient, culture, show, the, old, prussian, virtue, present, yourselves, as, christians, in, the, cheerful, endurance, of, suffering, may, honor, and, glory, follow, your, banners, and, arms, give, the, whole, world, an, example, of, manliness, and, discipline, you, know, full, well, that, you, are, to, fight, against, a, cunning, brave, well, armed, and, cruel, enemy, when, you, encounter, him, know, this, no, quarter, will, be, given, prisoners, will, not, be, taken, exercise, your, arms, such, that, for, a, thousand, years, no, chinese, will, dare, to, look, cross, eyed, at, a, german, maintain, discipline, may, god, s, blessing, be, with, you, the, prayers, of, an, entire, nation, and, my, good, wishes, go, with, you, each, and, every, one, open, the, way, to, civilization, once, and, for, all, now, you, may, depart, farewell, comrades, the, official, version, omitted, the, following, passage, from, which, the, speech, derives, its, name, should, you, encounter, the, enemy, he, will, be, defeated, no, quarter, will, be, given, prisoners, will, not, be, taken, whoever, falls, into, your, hands, is, forfeited, just, as, a, thousand, years, ago, the, huns, under, their, king, attila, made, a, name, for, themselves, one, that, even, today, makes, them, seem, mighty, in, history, and, legend, may, the, name, german, be, affirmed, by, you, in, such, a, way, in, china, that, no, chinese, will, ever, again, dare, to, look, cross, eyed, at, a, german, the, term, hun, later, became, the, favoured, epithet, of, allied, anti, german, war, propaganda, during, the, first, world, war, on, 6, march, 1901, during, a, visit, to, bremen, in, an, apparent, assassination, attempt, wilhelm, was, struck, in, the, face, by, a, sharp, iron, object, thrown, at, him, the, assailant, identified, as, johann, dietrich, weiland, was, adjudged, to, be, insane, the, kaiser, was, riding, in, a, coach, to, the, railway, station, when, the, incident, happened, at, 10, 10, pm, and, the, object, thrown, afterward, proved, to, be, a, fishplate, the, german, emperor, was, left, with, a, deep, wound, an, inch, and, a, half, long, below, his, left, eye, the, chief, of, the, naval, ministry, would, note, later, on, the, temple, or, in, the, eye, the, blow, could, have, been, devastating, the, wonder, of, it, is, that, our, all, gracious, lord, felt, neither, the, object, flying, at, him, nor, in, the, rain, the, copiously, flowing, blood, it, was, those, around, him, who, drew, his, attention, to, it, at, first, despite, rumors, in, the, press, that, the, kaiser, had, sunk, into, a, depression, he, would, say, in, a, speech, at, the, end, of, the, month, nothing, is, more, false, than, to, pretend, that, my, sanity, has, suffered, in, some, way, i, am, exactly, the, same, as, i, was, i, have, become, neither, elegiac, nor, melancholic, everything, stays, the, same, in, the, years, 1906, 1909, socialist, journalist, maximilian, harden, published, accusations, of, homosexual, activity, involving, ministers, courtiers, army, officers, and, wilhelm, s, closest, friend, and, advisor, prince, philipp, zu, eulenberg, according, to, robert, k, massie, homosexuality, was, officially, repressed, in, germany, it, was, a, criminal, offense, punishable, by, prison, although, the, law, was, rarely, invoked, or, enforced, still, the, very, accusation, could, stir, moral, outrage, and, bring, social, ruin, this, was, especially, true, at, the, highest, levels, of, society, the, result, was, years, of, highly, publicized, scandals, trials, resignations, and, suicides, harden, like, some, in, the, upper, echelons, of, the, military, and, foreign, office, resented, eulenberg, s, approval, of, the, anglo, french, entente, and, also, his, encouragement, of, wilhelm, to, rule, personally, the, scandal, led, to, wilhelm, experiencing, a, nervous, breakdown, and, the, removal, of, eulenberg, and, others, of, his, circle, from, the, court, the, view, that, wilhelm, was, a, deeply, repressed, homosexual, is, increasingly, supported, by, scholars, certainly, he, never, came, to, terms, with, his, feelings, for, eulenberg, historians, have, linked, the, eulenberg, scandal, to, a, fundamental, shift, in, german, policy, that, heightened, its, military, aggressiveness, and, ultimately, contributed, to, world, war, i, one, of, wilhelm, s, diplomatic, blunders, sparked, the, moroccan, crisis, of, 1905, he, made, a, spectacular, visit, to, tangier, in, morocco, on, 31, march, 1905, he, conferred, with, representatives, of, sultan, abdelaziz, of, morocco, the, kaiser, proceeded, to, tour, the, city, on, the, back, of, a, white, horse, the, kaiser, declared, he, had, come, to, support, the, sovereignty, of, the, sultan, a, statement, which, amounted, to, a, provocative, challenge, to, french, influence, in, morocco, the, sultan, subsequently, rejected, a, set, of, french, proposed, governmental, reforms, and, invited, major, world, powers, to, a, conference, that, advised, him, on, necessary, reforms, the, kaiser, s, presence, was, seen, as, an, assertion, of, german, interests, in, morocco, in, opposition, to, those, of, france, in, his, speech, he, even, made, remarks, in, favour, of, moroccan, independence, and, this, led, to, friction, with, france, which, was, expanding, its, colonial, interests, in, morocco, and, to, the, algeciras, conference, which, served, largely, to, further, isolate, germany, in, europe, wilhelm, s, most, damaging, personal, blunder, cost, him, much, of, his, prestige, and, power, and, had, a, far, greater, impact, in, germany, than, overseas, the, daily, telegraph, affair, of, 1908, involved, the, publication, in, germany, of, an, interview, with, a, british, daily, newspaper, that, included, wild, statements, and, diplomatically, damaging, remarks, wilhelm, had, seen, the, interview, as, an, opportunity, to, promote, his, views, and, ideas, on, anglo, german, friendship, but, due, to, his, emotional, outbursts, during, the, course, of, the, interview, he, ended, up, further, alienating, not, only, the, british, but, also, the, french, russians, and, japanese, he, implied, among, other, things, that, the, germans, cared, nothing, for, the, british, that, the, french, and, russians, had, attempted, to, incite, germany, to, intervene, in, the, second, boer, war, and, that, the, german, naval, buildup, was, targeted, against, the, japanese, not, britain, one, memorable, quotation, from, the, interview, was, you, english, are, mad, mad, mad, as, march, hares, the, effect, in, germany, was, quite, significant, with, serious, calls, for, his, abdication, wilhelm, kept, a, very, low, profile, for, many, months, after, the, daily, telegraph, fiasco, but, later, exacted, his, revenge, by, forcing, the, resignation, of, the, chancellor, prince, b, low, who, had, abandoned, the, emperor, to, public, scorn, by, not, having, the, transcript, edited, before, its, german, publication, the, daily, telegraph, crisis, deeply, wounded, wilhelm, s, previously, unimpaired, self, confidence, and, he, soon, experienced, a, severe, bout, of, depression, from, which, he, never, fully, recovered, he, lost, much, of, the, influence, he, had, previously, exercised, in, domestic, and, foreign, policy, nothing, wilhelm, did, in, the, international, arena, was, of, more, influence, than, his, decision, to, pursue, a, policy, of, massive, naval, construction, a, powerful, navy, was, wilhelm, s, pet, project, he, had, inherited, from, his, mother, a, love, of, the, british, royal, navy, which, was, at, that, time, the, world, s, largest, he, once, confided, to, his, uncle, the, prince, of, wales, that, his, dream, was, to, have, a, fleet, of, my, own, some, day, wilhelm, s, frustration, over, his, fleet, s, poor, showing, at, the, fleet, review, at, his, grandmother, s, diamond, jubilee, celebrations, combined, with, his, inability, to, exert, german, influence, in, south, africa, following, the, dispatch, of, the, kruger, telegram, led, to, wilhelm, taking, definitive, steps, toward, the, construction, of, a, fleet, to, rival, that, of, his, british, cousins, wilhelm, called, on, the, services, of, the, dynamic, naval, officer, alfred, von, tirpitz, whom, he, appointed, to, the, head, of, the, imperial, naval, office, in, 1897, the, new, admiral, had, conceived, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, risk, theory, or, the, tirpitz, plan, by, which, germany, could, force, britain, to, accede, to, german, demands, in, the, international, arena, through, the, threat, posed, by, a, powerful, battlefleet, concentrated, in, the, north, sea, tirpitz, enjoyed, wilhelm, s, full, support, in, his, advocacy, of, successive, naval, bills, of, 1897, and, 1900, by, which, the, german, navy, was, built, up, to, contend, with, that, of, the, british, empire, naval, expansion, under, the, fleet, acts, eventually, led, to, severe, financial, strains, in, germany, by, 1914, as, by, 1906, wilhelm, had, committed, his, navy, to, construction, of, the, much, larger, more, expensive, dreadnought, type, of, battleship, the, british, depended, on, naval, superiority, and, its, response, was, to, make, germany, its, most, feared, enemy, in, addition, to, the, expansion, of, the, fleet, the, kiel, canal, was, opened, in, 1895, enabling, faster, movements, between, the, north, sea, and, the, baltic, sea, in, 1889, wilhelm, reorganised, top, level, control, of, the, navy, by, creating, a, naval, cabinet, marine, kabinett, equivalent, to, the, german, imperial, military, cabinet, which, had, previously, functioned, in, the, same, capacity, for, both, the, army, and, navy, the, head, of, the, naval, cabinet, was, responsible, for, promotions, appointments, administration, and, issuing, orders, to, naval, forces, captain, gustav, von, senden, bibran, was, appointed, as, the, first, head, and, remained, so, until, 1906, the, existing, imperial, admiralty, was, abolished, and, its, responsibilities, divided, between, two, organisations, a, new, position, was, created, equivalent, to, the, supreme, commander, of, the, army, the, chief, of, the, high, command, of, the, admiralty, or, oberkommando, der, marine, was, responsible, for, ship, deployments, strategy, and, tactics, vice, admiral, max, von, der, goltz, was, appointed, in, 1889, and, remained, in, post, until, 1895, construction, and, maintenance, of, ships, and, obtaining, supplies, was, the, responsibility, of, the, state, secretary, of, the, imperial, navy, office, reichsmarineamt, responsible, to, the, imperial, chancellor, and, advising, the, reichstag, on, naval, matters, the, first, appointee, was, rear, admiral, karl, eduard, heusner, followed, shortly, by, rear, admiral, friedrich, von, hollmann, from, 1890, to, 1897, each, of, these, three, heads, of, department, reported, separately, to, wilhelm, historians, typically, argue, that, wilhelm, was, largely, confined, to, ceremonial, duties, during, the, war, there, were, innumerable, parades, to, review, and, honours, to, award, the, man, who, in, peace, had, believed, himself, omnipotent, became, in, war, a, shadow, kaiser, out, of, sight, neglected, and, relegated, to, the, sidelines, wilhelm, was, a, friend, of, franz, ferdinand, and, he, was, deeply, shocked, by, his, assassination, on, 28, june, 1914, wilhelm, offered, to, support, austria, hungary, in, crushing, the, black, hand, the, secret, organisation, that, had, plotted, the, killing, and, even, sanctioned, the, use, of, force, by, austria, against, the, perceived, source, of, the, movement, serbia, this, is, often, called, the, blank, cheque, he, wanted, to, remain, in, berlin, until, the, crisis, was, resolved, but, his, courtiers, persuaded, him, instead, to, go, on, his, annual, cruise, of, the, north, sea, on, 6, july, 1914, wilhelm, made, erratic, attempts, to, stay, on, top, of, the, crisis, via, telegram, and, when, the, austro, hungarian, ultimatum, was, delivered, to, serbia, he, hurried, back, to, berlin, he, reached, berlin, on, 28, july, read, a, copy, of, the, serbian, reply, and, wrote, on, it, a, brilliant, solution, and, in, barely, 48, hours, this, is, more, than, could, have, been, expected, a, great, moral, victory, for, vienna, but, with, it, every, pretext, for, war, falls, to, the, ground, and, giesl, had, better, have, stayed, quietly, at, belgrade, on, this, document, i, should, never, have, given, orders, for, mobilisation, unknown, to, the, emperor, austro, hungarian, ministers, and, generals, had, already, convinced, the, 83, year, old, franz, joseph, i, to, sign, a, declaration, of, war, against, serbia, as, a, direct, consequence, russia, began, a, general, mobilisation, to, attack, austria, in, defence, of, serbia, on, the, night, of, 30, july, 1914, when, handed, a, document, stating, that, russia, would, not, cancel, its, mobilisation, wilhelm, wrote, a, lengthy, commentary, containing, these, observations, for, i, no, longer, have, any, doubt, that, england, russia, and, france, have, agreed, among, themselves, knowing, that, our, treaty, obligations, compel, us, to, support, austria, to, use, the, austro, serb, conflict, as, a, pretext, for, waging, a, war, of, annihilation, against, us, our, dilemma, over, keeping, faith, with, the, old, and, honourable, emperor, has, been, exploited, to, create, a, situation, which, gives, england, the, excuse, she, has, been, seeking, to, annihilate, us, with, a, spurious, appearance, of, justice, on, the, pretext, that, she, is, helping, france, and, maintaining, the, well, known, balance, of, power, in, europe, i, e, playing, off, all, european, states, for, her, own, benefit, against, us, more, recent, british, authors, state, that, wilhelm, ii, really, declared, ruthlessness, and, weakness, will, start, the, most, terrifying, war, of, the, world, whose, purpose, is, to, destroy, germany, because, there, can, no, longer, be, any, doubts, england, france, and, russia, have, conspired, themselves, together, to, fight, an, annihilation, war, against, us, when, it, became, clear, that, germany, would, experience, a, war, on, two, fronts, and, that, britain, would, enter, the, war, if, germany, attacked, france, through, neutral, belgium, the, panic, stricken, wilhelm, attempted, to, redirect, the, main, attack, against, russia, when, helmuth, von, moltke, the, younger, who, had, chosen, the, old, plan, from, 1905, made, by, general, von, schlieffen, for, the, possibility, of, german, war, on, two, fronts, told, him, that, this, was, impossible, wilhelm, said, your, uncle, would, have, given, me, a, different, answer, wilhelm, is, also, reported, to, have, said, to, think, that, george, and, nicky, should, have, played, me, false, if, my, grandmother, had, been, alive, she, would, never, have, allowed, it, in, the, original, schlieffen, plan, germany, would, attack, the, supposed, weaker, enemy, first, meaning, france, the, plan, supposed, that, it, would, take, a, long, time, before, russia, was, ready, for, war, defeating, france, had, been, easy, for, prussia, in, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, at, the, 1914, border, between, france, and, germany, an, attack, at, this, more, southern, part, of, france, could, be, stopped, by, the, french, fortress, along, the, border, however, wilhelm, ii, stopped, any, invasion, of, the, netherlands, on, 1, august, 1914, saturday, wilhelm, ii, made, a, war, speech, in, front, of, a, great, crowd, on, monday, he, motored, back, to, berlin, from, potsdam, and, issued, an, imperial, order, to, convene, the, reichstag, the, next, day, on, 19, august, 1914, wilhelm, ii, predicted, that, germany, will, win, the, war, he, said, i, am, firmly, confident, that, with, the, help, of, god, the, bravery, of, the, german, army, and, navy, and, the, unquenchable, unanimity, of, the, german, people, during, those, hours, of, danger, victory, will, crown, our, cause, wilhelm, s, role, in, wartime, was, one, of, ever, decreasing, power, as, he, increasingly, handled, awards, ceremonies, and, honorific, duties, the, high, command, continued, with, its, strategy, even, when, it, was, clear, that, the, schlieffen, plan, had, failed, by, 1916, the, empire, had, effectively, become, a, military, dictatorship, under, the, control, of, field, marshal, paul, von, hindenburg, and, general, erich, ludendorff, increasingly, cut, off, from, reality, and, the, political, decision, making, process, wilhelm, vacillated, between, defeatism, and, dreams, of, victory, depending, upon, the, fortunes, of, his, armies, nevertheless, wilhelm, still, retained, the, ultimate, authority, in, matters, of, political, appointment, and, it, was, only, after, his, consent, had, been, gained, that, major, changes, to, the, high, command, could, be, brought, about, wilhelm, was, in, favour, of, the, dismissal, of, colonel, general, helmuth, von, moltke, in, september, 1914, and, his, replacement, by, general, erich, von, falkenhayn, in, 1917, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, decided, that, bethman, hollweg, was, no, longer, acceptable, to, them, as, chancellor, and, called, upon, the, kaiser, to, appoint, somebody, else, when, asked, whom, they, would, accept, ludendorff, recommended, georg, michaelis, a, nonentity, whom, he, barely, knew, despite, this, the, kaiser, accepted, the, suggestion, upon, hearing, in, july, 1917, that, his, cousin, george, v, had, changed, the, name, of, the, british, royal, house, to, windsor, wilhelm, remarked, that, he, planned, to, see, shakespeare, s, play, the, merry, wives, of, saxe, coburg, gotha, the, kaiser, s, support, base, collapsed, completely, in, october, november, 1918, in, the, military, the, civilian, government, and, in, german, public, opinion, as, president, woodrow, wilson, made, it, very, clear, that, the, monarchy, must, be, overthrown, before, an, end, of, the, war, could, take, place, that, year, also, saw, wilhelm, sickened, during, the, worldwide, spanish, flu, outbreak, though, he, survived, wilhelm, was, at, the, imperial, army, headquarters, in, spa, belgium, when, the, uprisings, in, berlin, and, other, centres, took, him, by, surprise, in, late, 1918, mutiny, among, the, ranks, of, his, beloved, kaiserliche, marine, the, imperial, navy, profoundly, shocked, him, after, the, outbreak, of, the, german, revolution, wilhelm, could, not, make, up, his, mind, whether, to, abdicate, up, to, that, point, he, accepted, that, he, would, likely, have, to, give, up, the, imperial, crown, but, still, hoped, to, retain, the, prussian, kingship, he, believed, that, as, ruler, of, two, thirds, of, germany, he, would, still, be, a, key, player, in, any, new, system, however, this, was, impossible, under, the, imperial, constitution, wilhelm, thought, he, ruled, as, emperor, in, a, personal, union, with, prussia, in, truth, the, constitution, defined, the, empire, as, a, confederation, of, states, under, the, permanent, presidency, of, prussia, the, imperial, crown, was, thus, tied, to, the, prussian, crown, meaning, that, wilhelm, could, not, renounce, one, crown, without, renouncing, the, other, wilhelm, s, hope, of, retaining, at, least, one, of, his, crowns, was, revealed, as, unrealistic, when, in, the, hope, of, preserving, the, monarchy, in, the, face, of, growing, revolutionary, unrest, chancellor, prince, max, of, baden, announced, wilhelm, s, abdication, of, both, titles, on, 9, november, 1918, prince, max, himself, was, forced, to, resign, later, the, same, day, when, it, became, clear, that, only, friedrich, ebert, leader, of, the, spd, could, effectively, exert, control, later, that, day, one, of, ebert, s, secretaries, of, state, ministers, social, democrat, philipp, scheidemann, proclaimed, germany, a, republic, wilhelm, accepted, this, fait, accompli, only, after, ludendorff, s, replacement, general, wilhelm, groener, had, informed, him, that, the, officers, and, men, of, the, army, would, march, back, in, good, order, under, hindenburg, s, command, but, would, certainly, not, fight, for, wilhelm, s, throne, the, monarchy, s, last, and, strongest, support, had, been, broken, and, finally, even, hindenburg, himself, a, lifelong, monarchist, was, obliged, after, polling, his, generals, to, advise, the, emperor, to, give, up, the, crown, on, 10, november, wilhelm, crossed, the, border, by, train, and, went, into, exile, in, the, neutral, netherlands, upon, the, conclusion, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, early, 1919, article, 227, expressly, provided, for, the, prosecution, of, wilhelm, for, a, supreme, offence, against, international, morality, and, the, sanctity, of, treaties, but, the, dutch, government, refused, to, extradite, him, king, george, v, wrote, that, he, looked, on, his, cousin, as, the, greatest, criminal, in, history, but, opposed, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, s, proposal, to, hang, the, kaiser, there, was, little, zeal, in, britain, to, prosecute, on, 1, january, 1920, it, was, stated, in, official, circles, in, london, that, great, britain, would, welcome, refusal, by, holland, to, deliver, the, former, kaiser, for, trial, and, it, was, hinted, that, this, had, been, conveyed, to, the, dutch, government, through, diplomatic, channels, punishment, of, the, former, kaiser, and, other, german, war, criminals, is, worrying, great, britain, little, it, was, said, as, a, matter, of, form, however, the, british, and, french, governments, were, expected, to, request, holland, for, the, former, kaiser, s, extradition, holland, it, was, said, will, refuse, on, the, ground, of, constitutional, provisions, covering, the, case, and, then, the, matter, will, be, dropped, the, request, for, extradition, will, not, be, based, on, genuine, desire, on, the, part, of, british, officials, to, bring, the, kaiser, to, trial, according, to, authoritative, information, but, is, considered, necessary, formality, to, save, the, face, of, politicians, who, promised, to, see, that, wilhelm, was, punished, for, his, crimes, president, woodrow, wilson, of, the, united, states, opposed, extradition, arguing, that, prosecuting, wilhelm, would, destabilise, international, order, and, lose, the, peace, wilhelm, first, settled, in, amerongen, where, on, 28, november, he, issued, a, belated, statement, of, abdication, from, both, the, prussian, and, imperial, thrones, thus, formally, ending, the, hohenzollerns, 500, year, rule, over, prussia, and, its, predecessor, state, brandenburg, finally, accepting, the, reality, that, he, had, lost, both, of, his, crowns, for, good, he, gave, up, his, rights, to, the, throne, of, prussia, and, to, the, german, imperial, throne, connected, therewith, he, also, released, his, soldiers, and, officials, in, both, prussia, and, the, empire, from, their, oath, of, loyalty, to, him, he, purchased, a, country, house, in, the, municipality, of, doorn, known, as, huis, doorn, and, moved, in, on, 15, may, 1920, this, was, to, be, his, home, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, the, weimar, republic, allowed, wilhelm, to, remove, twenty, three, railway, wagons, of, furniture, twenty, seven, containing, packages, of, all, sorts, one, bearing, a, car, and, another, a, boat, from, the, new, palace, at, potsdam, in, 1922, wilhelm, published, the, first, volume, of, his, memoirs, a, very, slim, volume, that, insisted, he, was, not, guilty, of, initiating, the, great, war, and, defended, his, conduct, throughout, his, reign, especially, in, matters, of, foreign, policy, for, the, remaining, twenty, years, of, his, life, he, entertained, guests, often, of, some, standing, and, kept, himself, updated, on, events, in, europe, he, grew, a, beard, and, allowed, his, famous, moustache, to, droop, adopting, a, style, very, similar, to, that, of, his, cousins, king, george, v, and, tsar, nicholas, ii, he, also, learned, the, dutch, language, wilhelm, developed, a, penchant, for, archaeology, while, residing, at, the, corfu, achilleion, excavating, at, the, site, of, the, temple, of, artemis, in, corfu, a, passion, he, retained, in, his, exile, he, had, bought, the, former, greek, residence, of, empress, elisabeth, after, her, murder, in, 1898, he, also, sketched, plans, for, grand, buildings, and, battleships, when, he, was, bored, in, exile, one, of, wilhelm, s, greatest, passions, was, hunting, and, he, killed, thousands, of, animals, both, beast, and, bird, much, of, his, time, was, spent, chopping, wood, and, thousands, of, trees, were, chopped, down, during, his, stay, at, doorn, wilhelm, ii, was, seen, as, the, richest, man, in, germany, before, 1914, after, his, abdication, he, retained, substantial, wealth, it, was, reported, that, at, least, 60, railway, wagons, were, needed, to, carry, his, furniture, art, porcelain, and, silver, from, germany, to, the, netherlands, the, kaiser, retained, substantial, cash, reserves, as, well, as, several, palaces, after, 1945, the, hohenzollerns, forests, farms, factories, and, palaces, in, what, became, east, germany, were, expropriated, and, thousands, of, artworks, were, subsumed, into, state, owned, museums, in, the, early, 1930s, wilhelm, apparently, hoped, that, the, successes, of, the, nazi, party, would, stimulate, interest, in, a, restoration, of, the, house, of, hohenzollern, with, his, eldest, grandson, as, the, new, kaiser, his, second, wife, hermine, actively, petitioned, the, nazi, government, on, her, husband, s, behalf, however, adolf, hitler, despite, being, a, veteran, of, the, imperial, german, army, during, the, first, world, war, felt, nothing, but, contempt, for, the, man, he, blamed, for, germany, s, greatest, defeat, and, the, petitions, were, ignored, though, he, played, host, to, hermann, g, ring, at, doorn, on, at, least, one, occasion, wilhelm, learned, to, distrust, hitler, hearing, of, the, murder, of, the, wife, of, former, chancellor, kurt, von, schleicher, during, the, night, of, the, long, knives, wilhelm, said, we, have, ceased, to, live, under, the, rule, of, law, and, everyone, must, be, prepared, for, the, possibility, that, the, nazis, will, push, their, way, in, and, put, them, up, against, the, wall, wilhelm, was, also, appalled, at, the, kristallnacht, of, 9, 10, november, 1938, saying, i, have, just, made, my, views, clear, to, auwi, in, the, presence, of, his, brothers, he, had, the, nerve, to, say, that, he, agreed, with, the, jewish, pogroms, and, understood, why, they, had, come, about, when, i, told, him, that, any, decent, man, would, describe, these, actions, as, gangsterisms, he, appeared, totally, indifferent, he, is, completely, lost, to, our, family, wilhelm, also, stated, for, the, first, time, i, am, ashamed, to, be, a, german, there, s, a, man, alone, without, family, without, children, without, god, he, builds, legions, but, he, doesn, t, build, a, nation, a, nation, is, created, by, families, a, religion, traditions, it, is, made, up, out, of, the, hearts, of, mothers, the, wisdom, of, fathers, the, joy, and, the, exuberance, of, children, for, a, few, months, i, was, inclined, to, believe, in, national, socialism, i, thought, of, it, as, a, necessary, fever, and, i, was, gratified, to, see, that, there, were, associated, with, it, for, a, time, some, of, the, wisest, and, most, outstanding, germans, but, these, one, by, one, he, has, got, rid, of, or, even, killed, papen, schleicher, neurath, and, even, blomberg, he, has, left, nothing, but, a, bunch, of, shirted, gangsters, this, man, could, bring, home, victories, to, our, people, each, year, without, bringing, them, either, glory, or, danger, but, of, our, germany, which, was, a, nation, of, poets, and, musicians, of, artists, and, soldiers, he, has, made, a, nation, of, hysterics, and, hermits, engulfed, in, a, mob, and, led, by, a, thousand, liars, or, fanatics, in, the, wake, of, the, german, victory, over, poland, in, september, 1939, wilhelm, s, adjutant, wilhelm, von, dommes, wrote, on, his, behalf, to, hitler, stating, that, the, house, of, hohenzollern, remained, loyal, and, noted, that, nine, prussian, princes, one, son, and, eight, grandchildren, were, stationed, at, the, front, concluding, because, of, the, special, circumstances, that, require, residence, in, a, neutral, foreign, country, his, majesty, must, personally, decline, to, make, the, aforementioned, comment, the, emperor, has, therefore, charged, me, with, making, a, communication, wilhelm, greatly, admired, the, success, which, the, wehrmacht, was, able, to, achieve, in, the, opening, months, of, the, second, world, war, and, personally, sent, hitler, a, congratulatory, telegram, when, the, netherlands, surrendered, in, may, 1940, my, f, hrer, i, congratulate, you, and, hope, that, under, your, marvellous, leadership, the, german, monarchy, will, be, restored, completely, unimpressed, hitler, commented, to, heinz, linge, his, valet, what, an, idiot, upon, the, fall, of, paris, a, month, later, wilhelm, sent, another, telegram, under, the, deeply, moving, impression, of, france, s, capitulation, i, congratulate, you, and, all, the, german, armed, forces, on, the, god, given, prodigious, victory, with, the, words, of, kaiser, wilhelm, the, great, of, the, year, 1870, what, a, turn, of, events, through, god, s, dispensation, all, german, hearts, are, filled, with, the, chorale, of, leuthen, which, the, victors, of, leuthen, the, soldiers, of, the, great, king, sang, now, thank, we, all, our, god, in, a, letter, to, his, daughter, victoria, louise, duchess, of, brunswick, he, wrote, triumphantly, thus, is, the, pernicious, entente, cordiale, of, uncle, edward, vii, brought, to, nought, in, a, september, 1940, letter, to, an, american, journalist, wilhelm, praised, germany, s, rapid, early, conquests, as, a, succession, of, miracles, but, remarked, also, that, the, brilliant, leading, generals, in, this, war, came, from, my, school, they, fought, under, my, command, in, the, world, war, as, lieutenants, captains, and, young, majors, educated, by, schlieffen, they, put, the, plans, he, had, worked, out, under, me, into, practice, along, the, same, lines, as, we, did, in, 1914, after, the, german, conquest, of, the, netherlands, in, 1940, the, aging, wilhelm, retired, completely, from, public, life, in, may, 1940, wilhelm, declined, an, offer, from, winston, churchill, of, asylum, in, britain, preferring, to, die, at, huis, doorn, during, his, last, year, at, doorn, wilhelm, believed, that, germany, was, still, the, land, of, monarchy, and, christianity, while, england, was, the, land, of, classical, liberalism, and, therefore, of, satan, and, the, antichrist, he, argued, that, the, english, nobility, were, freemasons, thoroughly, infected, by, juda, wilhelm, asserted, that, the, british, people, must, be, liberated, from, antichrist, juda, we, must, drive, juda, out, of, england, just, as, he, has, been, chased, out, of, the, continent, he, also, believed, a, conspiracy, theory, that, anglo, american, freemasonry, and, the, jews, had, caused, both, world, wars, and, were, aiming, for, a, world, empire, financed, by, british, and, american, gold, but, that, juda, s, plan, has, been, smashed, to, pieces, and, they, themselves, swept, out, of, the, european, continent, continental, europe, was, now, wilhelm, wrote, consolidating, and, closing, itself, off, from, british, influences, after, the, elimination, of, the, british, and, the, jews, the, result, would, be, a, u, s, of, europe, in, a, 1940, letter, to, his, sister, princess, margaret, wilhelm, wrote, the, hand, of, god, is, creating, a, new, world, working, we, are, becoming, the, u, s, of, europe, under, german, leadership, a, united, european, continent, he, added, the, jews, being, thrust, out, of, their, nefarious, positions, in, all, countries, whom, they, have, driven, to, hostility, for, centuries, also, in, 1940, came, what, would, have, been, his, mother, s, 100th, birthday, despite, their, very, troubled, relationship, wilhelm, wrote, to, a, friend, today, the, 100th, birthday, of, my, mother, no, notice, is, taken, of, it, at, home, no, memorial, service, or, committee, to, remember, her, marvellous, work, for, the, welfare, of, our, german, people, nobody, of, the, new, generation, knows, anything, about, her, wilhelm, died, of, a, pulmonary, embolism, in, doorn, netherlands, on, 4, june, 1941, at, the, age, of, 82, just, weeks, before, the, axis, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, despite, his, personal, resentment, and, animosity, toward, the, monarchy, hitler, wanted, to, bring, the, kaiser, s, body, back, to, berlin, for, a, state, funeral, as, hitler, felt, that, such, a, funeral, with, himself, acting, in, the, role, of, heir, apparent, to, the, throne, would, be, useful, to, exploit, for, propaganda, however, wilhelm, s, orders, that, his, body, was, not, to, return, to, germany, unless, the, monarchy, was, first, restored, were, then, revealed, and, were, grudgingly, respected, the, nazi, occupation, authorities, arranged, for, a, small, military, funeral, with, a, few, hundred, people, present, the, mourners, included, field, marshal, august, von, mackensen, fully, dressed, in, his, old, imperial, hussars, uniform, former, world, war, i, office, of, naval, intelligence, field, agent, admiral, wilhelm, canaris, colonel, general, curt, haase, world, war, i, flying, ace, turned, wehrmachtbefehlshaber, for, the, netherlands, general, friedrich, christiansen, and, reichskommissar, for, the, netherlands, arthur, seyss, inquart, along, with, a, few, other, military, advisers, however, kaiser, wilhelm, s, insistence, that, the, swastika, and, nazi, party, regalia, not, be, displayed, at, his, funeral, was, ignored, as, is, seen, in, the, photographs, of, the, funeral, taken, by, a, dutch, photographer, wilhelm, was, buried, in, a, mausoleum, upon, the, grounds, of, huis, doorn, which, has, since, become, a, place, of, pilgrimage, for, german, monarchists, who, gather, there, every, year, on, the, anniversary, of, his, death, to, pay, their, homage, to, the, last, german, emperor, three, trends, have, characterised, the, writing, about, wilhelm, first, the, court, inspired, writers, considered, him, a, martyr, and, a, hero, often, uncritically, accepting, the, justifications, provided, in, the, kaiser, s, own, memoirs, second, there, came, those, who, judged, wilhelm, to, be, completely, unable, to, handle, the, great, responsibilities, of, his, position, a, ruler, too, reckless, to, deal, with, power, third, after, 1950, later, scholars, have, sought, to, transcend, the, passions, of, the, early, 20th, century, and, attempted, an, objective, portrayal, of, wilhelm, and, his, rule, on, 8, june, 1913, a, year, before, the, great, war, began, the, new, york, times, published, a, special, supplement, devoted, to, the, 25th, anniversary, of, the, kaiser, s, accession, the, banner, headline, read, kaiser, 25, years, a, ruler, hailed, as, chief, peacemaker, the, accompanying, story, called, him, the, greatest, factor, for, peace, that, our, time, can, show, and, credited, wilhelm, with, frequently, rescuing, europe, from, the, brink, of, war, until, the, late, 1950s, germany, under, the, last, kaiser, was, depicted, by, most, historians, as, an, almost, absolute, monarchy, partly, however, this, was, a, deliberate, deception, by, german, civil, servants, and, elected, officials, for, example, former, president, theodore, roosevelt, believed, the, kaiser, was, in, control, of, german, foreign, policy, because, hermann, speck, von, sternburg, the, german, ambassador, in, washington, and, a, personal, friend, of, roosevelt, presented, to, the, president, messages, from, chancellor, von, b, low, as, though, they, were, messages, from, the, kaiser, later, historians, downplayed, his, role, arguing, that, senior, officials, regularly, learned, to, work, around, the, kaiser, s, back, more, recently, historian, john, c, g, r, hl, has, portrayed, wilhelm, as, the, key, figure, in, understanding, the, recklessness, and, downfall, of, imperial, germany, thus, the, argument, is, still, made, that, the, kaiser, played, a, major, role, in, promoting, the, policies, of, both, naval, and, colonialist, expansion, that, caused, the, deterioration, of, germany, s, relations, with, britain, before, 1914, wilhelm, and, his, first, wife, augusta, victoria, of, schleswig,

times, an, unbeaten, record, for, any, european, monarch, in, 1898, wilhelm, ii, wrote, to, nicholas, ii, that, if, i, had, come, there, without, any, religion, at, all, i, certainly, would, have, turned, mohammedan, in, response, to, the, political, competition, between, the, christian, sects, to, build, bigger, and, grander, churches, and, monuments, which, made, the, sects, appear, idolatrous, and, turned, muslims, away, from, the, christian, message, wilhelm, s, biographer, lamar, cecil, identified, wilhelm, s, curious, but, well, developed, anti, semitism, noting, that, in, 1888, a, friend, of, wilhelm, declared, that, the, young, kaiser, s, dislike, of, his, hebrew, subjects, one, rooted, in, a, perception, that, they, possessed, an, overweening, influence, in, germany, was, so, strong, that, it, could, not, be, overcome, cecil, concludes, wilhelm, never, changed, and, throughout, his, life, he, believed, that, jews, were, perversely, responsible, largely, through, their, prominence, in, the, berlin, press, and, in, leftist, political, movements, for, encouraging, opposition, to, his, rule, for, individual, jews, ranging, from, rich, businessmen, and, major, art, collectors, to, purveyors, of, elegant, goods, in, berlin, stores, he, had, considerable, esteem, but, he, prevented, jewish, citizens, from, having, careers, in, the, army, and, the, diplomatic,

had, done, to, the, ottoman, armenians, just, a, few, years, earlier, on, 2, december, 1919, wilhelm, wrote, to, mackensen, denouncing, the, november, revolution, of, 1918, and, his, own, forced, abdication, as, the, deepest, most, disgusting, shame, ever, perpetrated, by, a, person, in, history, the, germans, have, done, to, themselves, egged, on, and, misled, by, the, tribe, of, judah, let, no, german, ever, forget, this, nor, rest, until, these, parasites, have, been, destroyed, and, exterminated, from, german, soil, wilhelm, advocated, a, regular, international, all, worlds, pogrom, la, russe, as, the, best, cure, and, further, believed, that, jews, were, a, nuisance, that, humanity, must, get, rid, of, some, way, or, other, i, believe, the, best, thing, would, be, gas
