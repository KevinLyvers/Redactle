huldrych, or, ulrich, zwingli, 1, january, 1484, 11, october, 1531, was, a, leader, of, the, reformation, in, switzerland, born, during, a, time, of, emerging, swiss, patriotism, and, increasing, criticism, of, the, swiss, mercenary, system, he, attended, the, university, of, vienna, and, the, university, of, basel, a, scholarly, center, of, renaissance, humanism, he, continued, his, studies, while, he, served, as, a, pastor, in, glarus, and, later, in, einsiedeln, where, he, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, erasmus, in, 1519, zwingli, became, the, leutpriester, people, s, priest, of, the, grossm, nster, in, z, rich, where, he, began, to, preach, ideas, on, reform, of, the, catholic, church, in, his, first, public, controversy, in, 1522, he, attacked, the, custom, of, fasting, during, lent, in, his, publications, he, noted, corruption, in, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, promoted, clerical, marriage, and, attacked, the, use, of, images, in, places, of, worship, among, his, most, notable, contributions, to, the, reformation, was, his, expository, preaching, starting, in, 1519, through, the, gospel, of, matthew, before, eventually, using, biblical, exegesis, to, go, through, the, entire, new, testament, a, radical, departure, from, the, catholic, mass, in, 1525, he, introduced, a, new, communion, liturgy, to, replace, the, mass, he, also, clashed, with, the, anabaptists, which, resulted, in, their, persecution, historians, have, debated, whether, or, not, he, turned, z, rich, into, a, theocracy, the, reformation, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, swiss, confederation, but, several, cantons, resisted, preferring, to, remain, catholic, zwingli, formed, an, alliance, of, reformed, cantons, which, divided, the, confederation, along, religious, lines, in, 1529, a, war, was, averted, at, the, last, moment, between, the, two, sides, meanwhile, zwingli, s, ideas, came, to, the, attention, of, martin, luther, and, other, reformers, they, met, at, the, marburg, colloquy, and, agreed, on, many, points, of, doctrine, but, they, could, not, reach, an, accord, on, the, doctrine, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, in, 1531, zwingli, s, alliance, applied, an, unsuccessful, food, blockade, on, the, catholic, cantons, the, cantons, responded, with, an, attack, at, a, moment, when, z, rich, was, ill, prepared, and, zwingli, died, on, the, battlefield, his, legacy, lives, on, in, the, confessions, liturgy, and, church, orders, of, the, reformed, churches, of, today, the, swiss, confederation, in, huldrych, zwingli, s, time, consisted, of, thirteen, states, cantons, as, well, as, affiliated, areas, and, common, lordships, unlike, the, modern, state, of, switzerland, which, operates, under, a, federal, government, each, of, the, thirteen, cantons, was, nearly, independent, conducting, its, own, domestic, and, foreign, affairs, each, canton, formed, its, own, alliances, within, and, without, the, confederation, this, relative, independence, served, as, the, basis, for, conflict, during, the, time, of, the, reformation, when, the, various, cantons, divided, between, different, confessional, camps, military, ambitions, gained, an, additional, impetus, with, the, competition, to, acquire, new, territory, and, resources, as, seen, for, example, in, the, old, z, rich, war, of, 1440, 1446, the, wider, political, environment, in, europe, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, was, also, volatile, for, centuries, the, relationship, with, the, confederation, s, powerful, neighbour, france, determined, the, foreign, policies, of, the, swiss, nominally, the, confederation, formed, a, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, however, through, a, succession, of, wars, culminating, in, the, swabian, war, in, 1499, the, confederation, had, become, de, facto, independent, as, the, two, continental, powers, and, minor, regional, states, such, as, the, duchy, of, milan, the, duchy, of, savoy, and, the, papal, states, competed, and, fought, against, each, other, there, were, far, reaching, political, economic, and, social, consequences, for, the, confederation, during, this, time, the, mercenary, pension, system, became, a, subject, of, disagreement, the, religious, factions, of, zwingli, s, time, debated, vociferously, the, merits, of, sending, young, swiss, men, to, fight, in, foreign, wars, mainly, for, the, enrichment, of, the, cantonal, authorities, these, internal, and, external, factors, contributed, to, the, rise, of, a, confederation, national, consciousness, in, which, the, term, fatherland, latin, patria, began, to, take, on, meaning, beyond, a, reference, to, an, individual, canton, at, the, same, time, renaissance, humanism, with, its, universal, values, and, emphasis, on, scholarship, as, exemplified, by, erasmus, 1466, 1536, the, prince, of, humanism, had, taken, root, in, the, confederation, within, this, environment, defined, by, the, confluence, of, swiss, patriotism, and, humanism, zwingli, was, born, in, 1484, huldrych, zwingli, was, born, on, 1, january, 1484, in, wildhaus, in, the, toggenburg, valley, of, switzerland, to, a, family, of, farmers, the, third, child, of, eleven, his, father, ulrich, played, a, leading, role, in, the, administration, of, the, community, amtmann, or, chief, local, magistrate, zwingli, s, primary, schooling, was, provided, by, his, uncle, bartholomew, a, cleric, in, weesen, where, he, probably, met, katharina, von, zimmern, at, ten, years, old, zwingli, was, sent, to, basel, to, obtain, his, secondary, education, where, he, learned, latin, under, magistrate, gregory, b, nzli, after, three, years, in, basel, he, stayed, a, short, time, in, bern, with, the, humanist, henry, w, lfflin, the, dominicans, in, bern, tried, to, persuade, zwingli, to, join, their, order, and, it, is, possible, that, he, was, received, as, a, novice, however, his, father, and, uncle, disapproved, of, such, a, course, and, he, left, bern, without, completing, his, latin, studies, he, enrolled, in, the, university, of, vienna, in, the, winter, semester, of, 1498, but, was, expelled, according, to, the, university, s, records, however, it, is, not, certain, that, zwingli, was, indeed, expelled, and, he, re, enrolled, in, the, summer, semester, of, 1500, his, activities, in, 1499, are, unknown, zwingli, continued, his, studies, in, vienna, until, 1502, after, which, he, transferred, to, the, university, of, basel, where, he, received, the, master, of, arts, degree, magister, in, 1506, in, basel, one, of, zwingli, s, teachers, was, thomas, wyttenbach, from, biel, with, whom, he, later, corresponded, on, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, zwingli, was, ordained, in, constance, the, seat, of, the, local, diocese, and, he, celebrated, his, first, mass, in, his, hometown, wildhaus, on, 29, september, 1506, as, a, young, priest, he, had, studied, little, theology, but, this, was, not, considered, unusual, at, the, time, his, first, ecclesiastical, post, was, the, pastorate, of, the, town, of, glarus, where, he, stayed, for, ten, years, it, was, in, glarus, whose, soldiers, were, used, as, mercenaries, in, europe, that, zwingli, became, involved, in, politics, the, swiss, confederation, was, embroiled, in, various, campaigns, with, its, neighbours, the, french, the, habsburgs, and, the, papal, states, zwingli, placed, himself, solidly, on, the, side, of, the, roman, see, in, return, pope, julius, ii, honoured, zwingli, by, providing, him, with, an, annual, pension, he, took, the, role, of, chaplain, in, several, campaigns, in, italy, including, the, battle, of, novara, in, 1513, however, the, decisive, defeat, of, the, swiss, in, the, battle, of, marignano, caused, a, shift, in, mood, in, glarus, in, favour, of, the, french, rather, than, the, pope, zwingli, the, papal, partisan, found, himself, in, a, difficult, position, and, he, decided, to, retreat, to, einsiedeln, in, the, canton, of, schwyz, by, this, time, he, had, become, convinced, that, mercenary, service, was, immoral, and, that, swiss, unity, was, indispensable, for, any, future, achievements, some, of, his, earliest, extant, writings, such, as, the, ox, 1510, and, the, labyrinth, 1516, attacked, the, mercenary, system, using, allegory, and, satire, his, countrymen, were, presented, as, virtuous, people, within, a, french, imperial, and, papal, triangle, zwingli, stayed, in, einsiedeln, for, two, years, during, which, he, withdrew, completely, from, politics, in, favour, of, ecclesiastical, activities, and, personal, studies, his, time, as, pastor, of, glarus, and, einsiedeln, was, characterized, by, inner, growth, and, development, he, perfected, his, greek, and, he, took, up, the, study, of, hebrew, his, library, contained, over, three, hundred, volumes, from, which, he, was, able, to, draw, upon, classical, patristic, and, scholastic, works, he, exchanged, scholarly, letters, with, a, circle, of, swiss, humanists, and, began, to, study, the, writings, of, erasmus, zwingli, took, the, opportunity, to, meet, him, while, erasmus, was, in, basel, between, august, 1514, and, may, 1516, zwingli, s, turn, to, relative, pacifism, and, his, focus, on, preaching, can, be, traced, to, the, influence, of, erasmus, in, late, 1518, the, post, of, the, leutpriestertum, people, s, priest, of, the, grossm, nster, at, z, rich, became, vacant, the, canons, of, the, foundation, that, administered, the, grossm, nster, recognised, zwingli, s, reputation, as, a, fine, preacher, and, writer, his, connection, with, humanists, was, a, decisive, factor, as, several, canons, were, sympathetic, to, erasmian, reform, in, addition, his, opposition, to, the, french, and, to, mercenary, service, was, welcomed, by, z, rich, politicians, on, 11, december, 1518, the, canons, elected, zwingli, to, become, the, stipendiary, priest, and, on, 27, december, he, moved, permanently, to, z, rich, on, 1, january, 1519, zwingli, gave, his, first, sermon, in, z, rich, deviating, from, the, prevalent, practice, of, basing, a, sermon, on, the, gospel, lesson, of, a, particular, sunday, zwingli, using, erasmus, new, testament, as, a, guide, began, to, read, through, the, gospel, of, matthew, giving, his, interpretation, during, the, sermon, known, as, the, method, of, lectio, continua, he, continued, to, read, and, interpret, the, book, on, subsequent, sundays, until, he, reached, the, end, and, then, proceeded, in, the, same, manner, with, the, acts, of, the, apostles, the, new, testament, epistles, and, finally, the, old, testament, his, motives, for, doing, this, are, not, clear, but, in, his, sermons, he, used, exhortation, to, achieve, moral, and, ecclesiastical, improvement, which, were, goals, comparable, with, erasmian, reform, sometime, after, 1520, zwingli, s, theological, model, began, to, evolve, into, an, idiosyncratic, form, that, was, neither, erasmian, nor, lutheran, scholars, do, not, agree, on, the, process, of, how, he, developed, his, own, unique, model, one, view, is, that, zwingli, was, trained, as, an, erasmian, humanist, and, luther, played, a, decisive, role, in, changing, his, theology, another, view, is, that, zwingli, did, not, pay, much, attention, to, luther, s, theology, and, in, fact, he, considered, it, as, part, of, the, humanist, reform, movement, a, third, view, is, that, zwingli, was, not, a, complete, follower, of, erasmus, but, had, diverged, from, him, as, early, as, 1516, and, that, he, independently, developed, his, theology, zwingli, s, theological, stance, was, gradually, revealed, through, his, sermons, he, attacked, moral, corruption, and, in, the, process, he, named, individuals, who, were, the, targets, of, his, denunciations, monks, were, accused, of, indolence, and, high, living, in, 1519, zwingli, specifically, rejected, the, veneration, of, saints, and, called, for, the, need, to, distinguish, between, their, true, and, fictional, accounts, he, cast, doubts, on, hellfire, asserted, that, unbaptised, children, were, not, damned, and, questioned, the, power, of, excommunication, his, attack, on, the, claim, that, tithing, was, a, divine, institution, however, had, the, greatest, theological, and, social, impact, this, contradicted, the, immediate, economic, interests, of, the, foundation, one, of, the, elderly, canons, who, had, supported, zwingli, s, election, konrad, hofmann, complained, about, his, sermons, in, a, letter, some, canons, supported, hofmann, but, the, opposition, never, grew, very, large, zwingli, insisted, that, he, was, not, an, innovator, and, that, the, sole, basis, of, his, teachings, was, scripture, within, the, diocese, of, constance, bernhardin, sanson, was, offering, a, special, indulgence, for, contributors, to, the, building, of, st, peter, s, in, rome, when, sanson, arrived, at, the, gates, of, z, rich, at, the, end, of, january, 1519, parishioners, prompted, zwingli, with, questions, he, responded, with, displeasure, that, the, people, were, not, being, properly, informed, about, the, conditions, of, the, indulgence, and, were, being, induced, to, part, with, their, money, on, false, pretences, this, was, over, a, year, after, martin, luther, published, his, ninety, five, theses, 31, october, 1517, the, council, of, z, rich, refused, sanson, entry, into, the, city, as, the, authorities, in, rome, were, anxious, to, contain, the, fire, started, by, luther, the, bishop, of, constance, denied, any, support, of, sanson, and, he, was, recalled, in, august, 1519, z, rich, was, struck, by, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, during, which, at, least, one, in, four, persons, died, all, of, those, who, could, afford, it, left, the, city, but, zwingli, remained, and, continued, his, pastoral, duties, in, september, he, caught, the, disease, and, nearly, died, he, described, his, preparation, for, death, in, a, poem, zwingli, s, pestlied, consisting, of, three, parts, the, onset, of, the, illness, the, closeness, to, death, and, the, joy, of, recovery, the, final, verses, of, the, first, part, read, in, the, years, following, his, recovery, zwingli, s, opponents, remained, in, the, minority, when, a, vacancy, occurred, among, the, canons, of, the, grossm, nster, zwingli, was, elected, to, fulfill, that, vacancy, on, 29, april, 1521, in, becoming, a, canon, he, became, a, full, citizen, of, z, rich, he, also, retained, his, post, as, the, people, s, priest, of, the, grossm, nster, the, first, public, controversy, regarding, zwingli, s, preaching, broke, out, during, the, season, of, lent, in, 1522, on, the, first, fasting, sunday, 9, march, zwingli, and, about, a, dozen, other, participants, consciously, transgressed, the, fasting, rule, by, cutting, and, distributing, two, smoked, sausages, the, wurstessen, in, christoph, froschauer, s, workshop, zwingli, defended, this, act, in, a, sermon, which, was, published, on, 16, april, under, the, title, von, erkiesen, und, freiheit, der, speisen, regarding, the, choice, and, freedom, of, foods, he, noted, that, no, general, valid, rule, on, food, can, be, derived, from, the, bible, and, that, to, transgress, such, a, rule, is, not, a, sin, the, event, which, came, to, be, referred, to, as, the, affair, of, the, sausages, is, considered, to, be, the, start, of, the, reformation, in, switzerland, even, before, the, publication, of, this, treatise, the, diocese, of, constance, reacted, by, sending, a, delegation, to, z, rich, the, city, council, condemned, the, fasting, violation, but, assumed, responsibility, over, ecclesiastical, matters, and, requested, the, religious, authorities, clarify, the, issue, the, bishop, responded, on, 24, may, by, admonishing, the, grossm, nster, and, city, council, and, repeating, the, traditional, position, following, this, event, zwingli, and, other, humanist, friends, petitioned, the, bishop, on, 2, july, to, abolish, the, requirement, of, celibacy, on, the, clergy, two, weeks, later, the, petition, was, reprinted, for, the, public, in, german, as, eine, freundliche, bitte, und, ermahnung, an, die, eidgenossen, a, friendly, petition, and, admonition, to, the, confederates, the, issue, was, not, just, an, abstract, problem, for, zwingli, as, he, had, secretly, married, a, widow, anna, reinhart, earlier, in, the, year, their, cohabitation, was, well, known, and, their, public, wedding, took, place, on, 2, april, 1524, three, months, before, the, birth, of, their, first, child, they, would, have, four, children, regula, william, huldrych, and, anna, as, the, petition, was, addressed, to, the, secular, authorities, the, bishop, responded, at, the, same, level, by, notifying, the, z, rich, government, to, maintain, the, ecclesiastical, order, other, swiss, clergymen, joined, in, zwingli, s, cause, which, encouraged, him, to, make, his, first, major, statement, of, faith, apologeticus, archeteles, the, first, and, last, word, he, defended, himself, against, charges, of, inciting, unrest, and, heresy, he, denied, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, any, right, to, judge, on, matters, of, church, order, because, of, its, corrupted, state, the, events, of, 1522, brought, no, clarification, on, the, issues, not, only, did, the, unrest, between, z, rich, and, the, bishop, continue, tensions, were, growing, among, z, rich, s, confederation, partners, in, the, swiss, diet, on, 22, december, the, diet, recommended, that, its, members, prohibit, the, new, teachings, a, strong, indictment, directed, at, z, rich, the, city, council, felt, obliged, to, take, the, initiative, and, find, its, own, solution, on, 3, january, 1523, the, z, rich, city, council, invited, the, clergy, of, the, city, and, outlying, region, to, a, meeting, to, allow, the, factions, to, present, their, opinions, the, bishop, was, invited, to, attend, or, to, send, a, representative, the, council, would, render, a, decision, on, who, would, be, allowed, to, continue, to, proclaim, their, views, this, meeting, the, first, z, rich, disputation, took, place, on, 29, january, 1523, the, meeting, attracted, a, large, crowd, of, approximately, six, hundred, participants, the, bishop, sent, a, delegation, led, by, his, vicar, general, johannes, fabri, zwingli, summarised, his, position, in, the, schlussreden, concluding, statements, or, the, sixty, seven, articles, fabri, who, had, not, envisaged, an, academic, disputation, in, the, manner, zwingli, had, prepared, for, was, forbidden, to, discuss, high, theology, before, laymen, and, simply, insisted, on, the, necessity, of, the, ecclesiastical, authority, the, decision, of, the, council, was, that, zwingli, would, be, allowed, to, continue, his, preaching, and, that, all, other, preachers, should, teach, only, in, accordance, with, scripture, in, september, 1523, leo, jud, zwingli, s, closest, friend, and, colleague, and, pastor, of, st, peterskirche, publicly, called, for, the, removal, of, statues, of, saints, and, other, icons, this, led, to, demonstrations, and, iconoclastic, activities, the, city, council, decided, to, work, out, the, matter, of, images, in, a, second, disputation, the, essence, of, the, mass, and, its, sacrificial, character, was, also, included, as, a, subject, of, discussion, supporters, of, the, mass, claimed, that, the, eucharist, was, a, true, sacrifice, while, zwingli, claimed, that, it, was, a, commemorative, meal, as, in, the, first, disputation, an, invitation, was, sent, out, to, the, z, rich, clergy, and, the, bishop, of, constance, this, time, however, the, lay, people, of, z, rich, the, dioceses, of, chur, and, basel, the, university, of, basel, and, the, twelve, members, of, the, confederation, were, also, invited, about, nine, hundred, persons, attended, this, meeting, but, neither, the, bishop, nor, the, confederation, sent, representatives, the, disputation, started, on, 26, october, 1523, and, lasted, two, days, zwingli, again, took, the, lead, in, the, disputation, his, opponent, was, the, aforementioned, canon, konrad, hofmann, who, had, initially, supported, zwingli, s, election, also, taking, part, was, a, group, of, young, men, demanding, a, much, faster, pace, of, reformation, who, among, other, things, pleaded, for, replacing, infant, baptism, with, adult, baptism, this, group, was, led, by, conrad, grebel, one, of, the, initiators, of, the, anabaptist, movement, during, the, first, three, days, of, dispute, although, the, controversy, of, images, and, the, mass, were, discussed, the, arguments, led, to, the, question, of, whether, the, city, council, or, the, ecclesiastical, government, had, the, authority, to, decide, on, these, issues, at, this, point, konrad, schmid, a, priest, from, aargau, and, follower, of, zwingli, made, a, pragmatic, suggestion, as, images, were, not, yet, considered, to, be, valueless, by, everyone, he, suggested, that, pastors, preach, on, this, subject, under, threat, of, punishment, he, believed, the, opinions, of, the, people, would, gradually, change, and, the, voluntary, removal, of, images, would, follow, hence, schmid, rejected, the, radicals, and, their, iconoclasm, but, supported, zwingli, s, position, in, november, the, council, passed, ordinances, in, support, of, schmid, s, motion, zwingli, wrote, a, booklet, on, the, evangelical, duties, of, a, minister, kurze, christliche, einleitung, short, christian, introduction, and, the, council, sent, it, out, to, the, clergy, and, the, members, of, the, confederation, huldrych, zwingli, was, a, major, figure, in, the, swiss, reformation, advocating, for, the, authority, of, scripture, and, the, rejection, of, religious, practices, not, supported, by, the, bible, his, preaching, and, teachings, helped, spread, reformation, ideas, beyond, switzerland, and, influenced, the, development, of, protestantism, throughout, europe, in, december, 1523, the, council, set, a, deadline, of, pentecost, in, 1524, for, a, solution, to, the, elimination, of, the, mass, and, images, zwingli, gave, a, formal, opinion, in, vorschlag, wegen, der, bilder, und, der, messe, proposal, concerning, images, and, the, mass, he, did, not, urge, an, immediate, general, abolition, the, council, decided, on, the, orderly, removal, of, images, within, z, rich, but, rural, congregations, were, granted, the, right, to, remove, them, based, on, majority, vote, the, decision, on, the, mass, was, postponed, evidence, of, the, effect, of, the, reformation, was, seen, in, early, 1524, candlemas, was, not, celebrated, processions, of, robed, clergy, ceased, worshippers, did, not, go, with, palms, or, relics, on, palm, sunday, to, the, lindenhof, and, triptychs, remained, covered, and, closed, after, lent, opposition, to, the, changes, came, from, konrad, hofmann, and, his, followers, but, the, council, decided, in, favour, of, keeping, the, government, mandates, when, hofmann, left, the, city, opposition, from, pastors, hostile, to, the, reformation, broke, down, the, bishop, of, constance, tried, to, intervene, in, defending, the, mass, and, the, veneration, of, images, zwingli, wrote, an, official, response, for, the, council, and, the, result, was, the, severance, of, all, ties, between, the, city, and, the, diocese, although, the, council, had, hesitated, in, abolishing, the, mass, the, decrease, in, the, exercise, of, traditional, piety, allowed, pastors, to, be, unofficially, released, from, the, requirement, of, celebrating, mass, as, individual, pastors, altered, their, practices, as, each, saw, fit, zwingli, was, prompted, to, address, this, disorganised, situation, by, designing, a, communion, liturgy, in, the, german, language, this, was, published, in, aktion, oder, brauch, des, nachtmahls, act, or, custom, of, the, supper, shortly, before, easter, zwingli, and, his, closest, associates, requested, the, council, to, cancel, the, mass, and, to, introduce, the, new, public, order, of, worship, on, maundy, thursday, 13, april, 1525, zwingli, celebrated, communion, under, his, new, liturgy, wooden, cups, and, plates, were, used, to, avoid, any, outward, displays, of, formality, the, congregation, sat, at, set, tables, to, emphasise, the, meal, aspect, of, the, sacrament, the, sermon, was, the, focal, point, of, the, service, and, there, was, no, organ, music, or, singing, the, importance, of, the, sermon, in, the, worship, service, was, underlined, by, zwingli, s, proposal, to, limit, the, celebration, of, communion, to, four, times, a, year, for, some, time, zwingli, had, accused, mendicant, orders, of, hypocrisy, and, demanded, their, abolition, in, order, to, support, the, truly, poor, he, suggested, the, monasteries, be, changed, into, hospitals, and, welfare, institutions, and, incorporate, their, wealth, into, a, welfare, fund, this, was, done, by, reorganising, the, foundations, of, the, grossm, nster, and, fraum, nster, and, pensioning, off, remaining, nuns, and, monks, the, council, secularised, the, church, properties, fraum, nster, handed, over, to, the, city, of, zurich, by, zwingli, s, acquaintance, katharina, von, zimmern, in, 1524, and, established, new, welfare, programs, for, the, poor, zwingli, requested, permission, to, establish, a, latin, school, the, prophezei, prophecy, or, carolinum, at, the, grossm, nster, the, council, agreed, and, it, was, officially, opened, on, 19, june, 1525, with, zwingli, and, jud, as, teachers, it, served, to, retrain, and, re, educate, the, clergy, the, z, rich, bible, translation, traditionally, attributed, to, zwingli, and, printed, by, christoph, froschauer, bears, the, mark, of, teamwork, from, the, prophecy, school, scholars, have, not, yet, attempted, to, clarify, zwingli, s, share, of, the, work, based, on, external, and, stylistic, evidence, shortly, after, the, second, z, rich, disputation, many, in, the, radical, wing, of, the, reformation, became, convinced, that, zwingli, was, making, too, many, concessions, to, the, z, rich, council, they, rejected, the, role, of, civil, government, and, demanded, the, immediate, establishment, of, a, congregation, of, the, faithful, conrad, grebel, the, leader, of, the, radicals, and, the, emerging, anabaptist, movement, spoke, disparagingly, of, zwingli, in, private, on, 15, august, 1524, the, council, insisted, on, the, obligation, to, baptise, all, newborn, infants, zwingli, secretly, conferred, with, grebel, s, group, and, late, in, 1524, the, council, called, for, official, discussions, when, talks, were, broken, off, zwingli, published, wer, ursache, gebe, zu, aufruhr, whoever, causes, unrest, clarifying, the, opposing, points, of, view, on, 17, january, 1525, a, public, debate, was, held, and, the, council, decided, in, favour, of, zwingli, anyone, refusing, to, have, their, children, baptised, was, required, to, leave, z, rich, the, radicals, ignored, these, measures, and, on, 21, january, they, met, at, the, house, of, the, mother, of, another, radical, leader, felix, manz, grebel, and, a, third, leader, george, blaurock, performed, the, first, recorded, anabaptist, adult, baptisms, on, 2, february, the, council, repeated, the, requirement, on, the, baptism, of, all, babies, and, some, who, failed, to, comply, were, arrested, and, fined, manz, and, blaurock, among, them, zwingli, and, jud, interviewed, them, and, more, debates, were, held, before, the, z, rich, council, meanwhile, the, new, teachings, continued, to, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, confederation, as, well, as, a, number, of, swabian, towns, on, 6, 8, november, the, last, debate, on, the, subject, of, baptism, took, place, in, the, grossm, nster, grebel, manz, and, blaurock, defended, their, cause, before, zwingli, jud, and, other, reformers, there, was, no, serious, exchange, of, views, as, each, side, would, not, move, from, their, positions, and, the, debates, degenerated, into, an, uproar, each, side, shouting, abuse, at, the, other, the, z, rich, council, decided, that, no, compromise, was, possible, on, 7, march, 1526, it, released, the, notorious, mandate, that, no, one, shall, rebaptise, another, under, the, penalty, of, death, although, zwingli, technically, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, mandate, there, is, no, indication, that, he, disapproved, felix, manz, who, had, sworn, to, leave, z, rich, and, not, to, baptise, any, more, had, deliberately, returned, and, continued, the, practice, after, he, was, arrested, and, tried, he, was, executed, on, 5, january, 1527, by, being, drowned, in, the, limmat, he, was, the, first, anabaptist, martyr, three, more, were, to, follow, after, which, all, others, either, fled, or, were, expelled, from, z, rich, on, 8, april, 1524, five, cantons, lucerne, uri, schwyz, unterwalden, and, zug, formed, an, alliance, die, f, nf, orte, the, five, states, to, defend, themselves, from, zwingli, s, reformation, they, contacted, the, opponents, of, martin, luther, including, john, eck, who, had, debated, luther, in, the, leipzig, disputation, of, 1519, eck, offered, to, dispute, zwingli, and, he, accepted, however, they, could, not, agree, on, the, selection, of, the, judging, authority, the, location, of, the, debate, and, the, use, of, the, swiss, diet, as, a, court, because, of, the, disagreements, zwingli, decided, to, boycott, the, disputation, on, 19, may, 1526, all, the, cantons, sent, delegates, to, baden, although, z, rich, s, representatives, were, present, they, did, not, participate, in, the, sessions, eck, led, the, catholic, party, while, the, reformers, were, represented, by, johannes, oecolampadius, of, basel, a, theologian, from, w, rttemberg, who, had, carried, on, an, extensive, and, friendly, correspondence, with, zwingli, while, the, debate, proceeded, zwingli, was, kept, informed, of, the, proceedings, and, printed, pamphlets, giving, his, opinions, it, was, of, little, use, as, the, diet, decided, against, zwingli, he, was, to, be, banned, and, his, writings, were, no, longer, to, be, distributed, of, the, thirteen, confederation, members, glarus, solothurn, fribourg, and, appenzell, as, well, as, the, five, states, voted, against, zwingli, bern, basel, schaffhausen, and, z, rich, supported, him, the, baden, disputation, exposed, a, deep, rift, in, the, confederation, on, matters, of, religion, the, reformation, was, now, emerging, in, other, states, the, city, of, st, gallen, an, affiliated, state, to, the, confederation, was, led, by, a, reformed, mayor, joachim, vadian, and, the, city, abolished, the, mass, in, 1527, just, two, years, after, z, rich, in, basel, although, zwingli, had, a, close, relationship, with, oecolampadius, the, government, did, not, officially, sanction, any, reformatory, changes, until, 1, april, 1529, when, the, mass, was, prohibited, schaffhausen, which, had, closely, followed, z, rich, s, example, formally, adopted, the, reformation, in, september, 1529, in, the, case, of, bern, berchtold, haller, the, priest, at, st, vincent, m, nster, and, niklaus, manuel, the, poet, painter, and, politician, had, campaigned, for, the, reformed, cause, but, it, was, only, after, another, disputation, that, bern, counted, itself, as, a, canton, of, the, reformation, three, hundred, and, fifty, persons, participated, 144, including, pastors, from, bern, and, other, cantons, as, well, as, theologians, from, outside, the, confederation, such, as, martin, bucer, and, wolfgang, capito, from, strasbourg, ambrosius, blarer, from, constance, and, andreas, althamer, from, nuremberg, eck, and, fabri, refused, to, attend, and, the, catholic, cantons, did, not, send, representatives, the, meeting, started, on, 6, january, 1528, and, lasted, nearly, three, weeks, zwingli, assumed, the, main, burden, of, defending, the, reformation, and, he, preached, twice, in, the, m, nster, on, 7, february, 1528, the, council, decreed, that, the, reformation, be, established, in, bern, even, before, the, bern, disputation, zwingli, was, canvassing, for, an, alliance, of, reformed, cities, once, bern, officially, accepted, the, reformation, a, new, alliance, das, christliche, burgrecht, the, christian, civic, union, was, created, the, first, meetings, were, held, in, bern, between, representatives, of, bern, constance, and, z, rich, on, 5, 6, january, 1528, other, cities, including, basel, biel, m, lhausen, schaffhausen, and, st, gallen, eventually, joined, the, alliance, the, five, catholic, states, felt, encircled, and, isolated, so, they, searched, for, outside, allies, after, two, months, of, negotiations, the, five, states, formed, die, christliche, vereinigung, the, christian, alliance, with, ferdinand, of, austria, on, 22, april, 1529, soon, after, the, austrian, treaty, was, signed, a, reformed, preacher, jacob, kaiser, was, captured, in, uznach, and, executed, in, schwyz, this, triggered, a, strong, reaction, from, zwingli, he, drafted, ratschlag, ber, den, krieg, advice, about, the, war, for, the, government, he, outlined, justifications, for, an, attack, on, the, catholic, states, and, other, measures, to, be, taken, before, z, rich, could, implement, his, plans, a, delegation, from, bern, that, included, niklaus, manuel, arrived, in, z, rich, the, delegation, called, on, z, rich, to, settle, the, matter, peacefully, manuel, added, that, an, attack, would, expose, bern, to, further, dangers, as, catholic, valais, and, the, duchy, of, savoy, bordered, its, southern, flank, he, then, noted, you, cannot, really, bring, faith, by, means, of, spears, and, halberds, z, rich, however, decided, that, it, would, act, alone, knowing, that, bern, would, be, obliged, to, acquiesce, war, was, declared, on, 8, june, 1529, z, rich, was, able, to, raise, an, army, of, 30, 000, men, the, five, states, were, abandoned, by, austria, and, could, raise, only, 9, 000, men, the, two, forces, met, near, kappel, but, war, was, averted, due, to, the, intervention, of, hans, aebli, a, relative, of, zwingli, who, pleaded, for, an, armistice, zwingli, was, obliged, to, state, the, terms, of, the, armistice, he, demanded, the, dissolution, of, the, christian, alliance, unhindered, preaching, by, reformers, in, the, catholic, states, prohibition, of, the, pension, system, payment, of, war, reparations, and, compensation, to, the, children, of, jacob, kaiser, manuel, was, involved, in, the, negotiations, bern, was, not, prepared, to, insist, on, the, unhindered, preaching, or, the, prohibition, of, the, pension, system, z, rich, and, bern, could, not, agree, and, the, five, catholic, states, pledged, only, to, dissolve, their, alliance, with, austria, this, was, a, bitter, disappointment, for, zwingli, and, it, marked, his, decline, in, political, influence, the, first, land, peace, of, kappel, der, erste, landfriede, ended, the, war, on, 24, june, while, zwingli, carried, on, the, political, work, of, the, swiss, reformation, he, developed, his, theological, views, with, his, colleagues, the, famous, disagreement, between, luther, and, zwingli, on, the, interpretation, of, the, eucharist, originated, when, andreas, karlstadt, luther, s, former, colleague, from, wittenberg, published, three, pamphlets, on, the, lord, s, supper, in, which, karlstadt, rejected, the, idea, of, a, real, presence, in, the, elements, these, pamphlets, published, in, basel, in, 1524, received, the, approval, of, oecolampadius, and, zwingli, luther, rejected, karlstadt, s, arguments, and, considered, zwingli, primarily, to, be, a, partisan, of, karlstadt, zwingli, began, to, express, his, thoughts, on, the, eucharist, in, several, publications, including, de, eucharistia, on, the, eucharist, understanding, that, christ, had, ascended, to, heaven, and, was, sitting, at, the, father, s, right, hand, zwingli, criticized, the, idea, that, christ, s, humanity, could, be, in, two, places, at, once, unlike, his, divinity, christ, s, human, body, was, not, omnipresent, and, so, could, not, be, in, heaven, and, at, the, same, time, be, present, in, the, elements, timothy, george, evangelical, author, editor, of, christianity, today, and, professor, of, historical, theology, at, beeson, divinity, school, at, samford, university, has, refuted, a, long, standing, misreading, of, zwingli, that, erroneously, claimed, the, reformer, denied, all, notions, of, real, presence, and, believed, in, a, memorial, view, of, the, supper, where, it, was, purely, symbolic, by, spring, 1527, luther, reacted, strongly, to, zwingli, s, views, in, the, treatise, dass, diese, worte, christi, das, ist, mein, leib, etc, noch, fest, stehen, wider, die, schwarmgeister, that, these, words, of, christ, this, is, my, body, etc, still, stand, firm, against, the, fanatics, the, controversy, continued, until, 1528, when, efforts, to, build, bridges, between, the, lutheran, and, the, zwinglian, views, began, martin, bucer, tried, to, mediate, while, philip, of, hesse, who, wanted, to, form, a, political, coalition, of, all, protestant, forces, invited, the, two, parties, to, marburg, to, discuss, their, differences, this, event, became, known, as, the, marburg, colloquy, zwingli, accepted, philip, s, invitation, fully, believing, that, he, would, be, able, to, convince, luther, in, contrast, luther, did, not, expect, anything, to, come, out, of, the, meeting, and, had, to, be, urged, by, philip, to, attend, zwingli, accompanied, by, oecolampadius, arrived, on, 28, september, 1529, with, luther, and, philipp, melanchthon, arriving, shortly, thereafter, other, theologians, also, participated, including, martin, bucer, andreas, osiander, johannes, brenz, and, justus, jonas, the, debates, were, held, from, 1, 4, october, and, the, results, were, published, in, the, fifteen, marburg, articles, the, participants, were, able, to, agree, on, fourteen, of, the, articles, but, the, fifteenth, article, established, the, differences, in, their, views, on, the, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, professor, george, summarized, the, incompatible, views, on, this, issue, they, parted, without, having, reached, an, agreement, both, luther, and, zwingli, agreed, that, the, bread, in, the, supper, was, a, sign, for, luther, however, that, which, the, bread, signified, namely, the, body, of, christ, was, present, in, with, and, under, the, sign, itself, for, zwingli, though, sign, and, thing, signified, were, separated, by, a, distance, the, width, between, heaven, and, earth, luther, claimed, that, the, body, of, christ, was, not, eaten, in, a, gross, material, way, but, rather, in, some, mysterious, way, which, is, beyond, human, understanding, yet, zwingli, replied, if, the, words, were, taken, in, their, literal, sense, the, body, had, to, be, eaten, in, the, most, grossly, material, way, for, this, is, the, meaning, they, carry, this, bread, is, that, body, of, mine, which, is, given, for, you, it, was, given, for, us, in, grossly, material, form, subject, to, wounds, blows, and, death, as, such, therefore, it, must, be, the, material, of, the, supper, indeed, to, press, the, literal, meaning, of, the, text, even, farther, it, follows, that, christ, would, have, again, to, suffer, pain, as, his, body, was, broken, again, this, time, by, the, teeth, of, communicants, even, more, absurdly, christ, s, body, would, have, to, be, swallowed, digested, even, eliminated, through, the, bowels, such, thoughts, were, repulsive, to, zwingli, they, smacked, of, cannibalism, on, the, one, hand, and, of, the, pagan, mystery, religions, on, the, other, the, main, issue, for, zwingli, however, was, not, the, irrationality, or, exegetical, fallacy, of, luther, s, views, it, was, rather, that, luther, put, the, chief, point, of, salvation, in, physically, eating, the, body, of, christ, for, he, connected, it, with, the, forgiveness, of, sins, the, same, motive, that, had, moved, zwingli, so, strongly, to, oppose, images, the, invocation, of, saints, and, baptismal, regeneration, was, present, also, in, the, struggle, over, the, supper, the, fear, of, idolatry, salvation, was, by, christ, alone, through, faith, alone, not, through, faith, and, bread, the, object, of, faith, was, that, which, is, not, seen, heb, 11, 1, and, which, therefore, cannot, be, eaten, except, again, in, a, nonliteral, figurative, sense, credere, est, edere, said, zwingli, to, believe, is, to, eat, to, eat, the, body, and, to, drink, the, blood, of, christ, in, the, supper, then, simply, meant, to, have, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, present, in, the, mind, the, failure, to, find, agreement, resulted, in, strong, emotions, on, both, sides, when, the, two, sides, departed, zwingli, cried, out, in, tears, there, are, no, people, on, earth, with, whom, i, would, rather, be, at, one, than, the, wittenbergers, due, to, these, differences, luther, initially, refused, to, acknowledge, zwingli, and, his, followers, as, christians, with, the, failure, of, the, marburg, colloquy, and, the, split, of, the, confederation, zwingli, set, his, goal, on, an, alliance, with, philip, of, hesse, he, kept, up, a, lively, correspondence, with, philip, bern, refused, to, participate, but, after, a, long, process, z, rich, basel, and, strasbourg, signed, a, mutual, defence, treaty, with, philip, in, november, 1530, zwingli, also, personally, negotiated, with, france, s, diplomatic, representative, but, the, two, sides, were, too, far, apart, france, wanted, to, maintain, good, relations, with, the, five, states, approaches, to, venice, and, milan, also, failed, as, zwingli, was, working, on, establishing, these, political, alliances, charles, v, the, holy, roman, emperor, invited, protestants, to, the, augsburg, diet, to, present, their, views, so, that, he, could, make, a, verdict, on, the, issue, of, faith, the, lutherans, presented, the, augsburg, confession, under, the, leadership, of, martin, bucer, the, cities, of, strasbourg, constance, memmingen, and, lindau, produced, the, tetrapolitan, confession, this, document, attempted, to, take, a, middle, position, between, the, lutherans, and, zwinglians, it, was, too, late, for, the, burgrecht, cities, to, produce, a, confession, of, their, own, zwingli, then, produced, his, own, private, confession, fidei, ratio, account, of, faith, in, which, he, explained, his, faith, in, twelve, articles, conforming, to, the, articles, of, the, apostles, creed, the, tone, was, strongly, anti, catholic, as, well, as, anti, lutheran, the, lutherans, did, not, react, officially, but, criticised, it, privately, zwingli, s, and, luther, s, old, opponent, johann, eck, counter, attacked, with, a, publication, refutation, of, the, articles, zwingli, submitted, to, the, emperor, when, philip, of, hesse, formed, the, schmalkaldic, league, at, the, end, of, 1530, the, four, cities, of, the, tetrapolitan, confession, joined, on, the, basis, of, a, lutheran, interpretation, of, that, confession, given, the, flexibility, of, the, league, s, entrance, requirements, z, rich, basel, and, bern, also, considered, joining, however, zwingli, could, not, reconcile, the, tetrapolitan, confession, with, his, own, beliefs, and, wrote, a, harsh, refusal, to, bucer, and, capito, this, offended, philip, to, the, point, where, relations, with, the, league, were, severed, the, burgrecht, cities, now, had, no, external, allies, to, help, deal, with, internal, confederation, religious, conflicts, the, peace, treaty, of, the, first, kappel, war, did, not, define, the, right, of, unhindered, preaching, in, the, catholic, states, zwingli, interpreted, this, to, mean, that, preaching, should, be, permitted, but, the, five, states, suppressed, any, attempts, to, reform, the, burgrecht, cities, considered, different, means, of, applying, pressure, to, the, five, states, basel, and, schaffhausen, preferred, quiet, diplomacy, while, z, rich, wanted, armed, conflict, zwingli, and, jud, unequivocally, advocated, an, attack, on, the, five, states, bern, took, a, middle, position, which, eventually, prevailed, in, may, 1531, z, rich, reluctantly, agreed, to, impose, a, food, blockade, it, failed, to, have, any, effect, and, in, october, bern, decided, to, withdraw, the, blockade, z, rich, urged, its, continuation, and, the, burgrecht, cities, began, to, quarrel, among, themselves, on, 9, october, 1531, in, a, surprise, move, the, five, states, declared, war, on, z, rich, z, rich, s, mobilisation, was, slow, due, to, internal, squabbling, and, on, 11, october, 3500, poorly, deployed, men, encountered, a, five, states, force, nearly, double, their, size, near, kappel, many, pastors, including, zwingli, were, among, the, soldiers, the, battle, lasted, less, than, one, hour, and, zwingli, was, among, the, 500, casualties, in, the, z, rich, army, zwingli, had, considered, himself, first, and, foremost, a, soldier, of, christ, second, a, defender, of, his, country, the, confederation, and, third, a, leader, of, his, city, z, rich, where, he, had, lived, for, the, previous, twelve, years, ironically, he, died, at, the, age, of, 47, not, for, christ, nor, for, the, confederation, but, for, z, rich, in, tabletalk, luther, is, recorded, saying, they, say, that, zwingli, recently, died, thus, if, his, error, had, prevailed, we, would, have, perished, and, our, church, with, us, it, was, a, judgment, of, god, that, was, always, a, proud, people, the, others, the, papists, will, probably, also, be, dealt, with, by, our, lord, god, erasmus, wrote, we, are, freed, from, great, fear, by, the, death, of, the, two, preachers, zwingli, and, oecolampadius, whose, fate, has, wrought, an, incredible, change, in, the, mind, of, many, this, is, the, wonderful, hand, of, god, on, high, oecolampadius, had, died, on, 24, november, erasmus, also, wrote, if, bellona, had, favoured, them, it, would, have, been, all, over, with, us, according, to, zwingli, the, cornerstone, of, theology, is, the, bible, zwingli, appealed, to, scripture, constantly, in, his, writings, he, placed, its, authority, above, other, sources, such, as, the, ecumenical, councils, or, the, church, fathers, although, he, did, not, hesitate, to, use, other, sources, to, support, his, arguments, the, principles, that, guide, zwingli, s, interpretations, are, derived, from, his, rationalist, humanist, education, and, his, reformed, understanding, of, the, bible, he, rejected, literalist, interpretations, of, a, passage, such, as, those, of, the, anabaptists, and, used, synecdoche, and, analogies, methods, he, describes, in, a, friendly, exegesis, 1527, two, analogies, that, he, used, quite, effectively, were, between, baptism, and, circumcision, and, between, the, eucharist, and, passover, he, also, paid, attention, to, the, immediate, context, and, attempted, to, understand, the, purpose, behind, it, comparing, passages, of, scripture, with, each, other, zwingli, rejected, the, word, sacrament, in, the, popular, usage, of, his, time, for, ordinary, people, the, word, meant, some, kind, of, holy, action, of, which, there, is, inherent, power, to, free, the, conscience, from, sin, for, zwingli, a, sacrament, was, an, initiatory, ceremony, or, a, pledge, pointing, out, that, the, word, was, derived, from, sacramentum, meaning, an, oath, however, the, word, is, also, translated, mystery, in, his, early, writings, on, baptism, he, noted, that, baptism, was, an, example, of, such, a, pledge, he, challenged, catholics, by, accusing, them, of, superstition, when, they, ascribed, the, water, of, baptism, a, certain, power, to, wash, away, sin, later, in, his, conflict, with, the, anabaptists, he, defended, the, practice, of, infant, baptism, noting, that, there, is, no, law, forbidding, the, practice, he, argued, that, baptism, was, a, sign, of, a, covenant, with, god, thereby, replacing, circumcision, in, the, old, testament, zwingli, approached, the, eucharist, in, a, similar, manner, to, baptism, during, the, first, z, rich, disputation, in, 1523, he, denied, that, an, actual, sacrifice, occurred, during, the, mass, arguing, that, christ, made, the, sacrifice, only, once, and, for, all, eternity, hence, the, eucharist, was, a, memorial, of, the, sacrifice, following, this, argument, he, further, developed, his, view, coming, to, the, conclusion, of, the, signifies, interpretation, for, the, words, of, the, institution, he, used, various, passages, of, scripture, to, argue, against, transubstantiation, as, well, as, luther, s, views, the, key, text, being, john, 6, 63, it, is, the, spirit, who, gives, life, the, flesh, is, of, no, avail, zwingli, s, approach, and, interpretation, of, scripture, to, understand, the, meaning, of, the, eucharist, was, one, reason, he, could, not, reach, a, consensus, with, luther, the, impact, of, luther, on, zwingli, s, theological, development, has, long, been, a, source, of, interest, and, discussion, among, lutheran, scholars, who, seek, to, firmly, establish, luther, as, the, first, reformer, zwingli, himself, asserted, vigorously, his, independence, of, luther, and, the, most, recent, studies, have, lent, credibility, to, this, claim, zwingli, appears, to, have, read, luther, s, books, in, search, of, confirmation, from, luther, for, his, own, views, he, agreed, with, the, stand, luther, took, against, the, pope, like, luther, zwingli, was, also, a, student, and, admirer, of, augustine, in, contrast, to, luther, zwingli, adhered, to, official, church, theology, on, judaism, however, as, most, protestants, and, catholics, did, at, the, time, he, believed, that, the, crucifixion, of, christ, led, to, the, dispersal, of, jews, from, jerusalem, in, contrast, zwingli, s, creed, was, convinced, that, the, papacy, and, its, military, power, derived, from, jewish, influences, together, with, john, calvin, he, protracted, jewish, influences, in, christian, churches, and, advocated, the, principle, of, sola, scriptura, in, which, the, old, testament, and, its, subjects, would, remain, a, constant, influence, in, future, churches, he, thereby, opposed, the, anti, semitic, tendencies, of, luther, and, placed, himself, closer, to, catholicism, during, the, reformation, zwingli, enjoyed, music, and, could, play, several, instruments, including, the, violin, harp, flute, dulcimer, and, hunting, horn, he, would, sometimes, amuse, the, children, of, his, congregation, on, his, lute, and, was, so, well, known, for, his, playing, that, his, enemies, mocked, him, as, the, evangelical, lute, player, and, fifer, three, of, zwingli, s, lieder, or, hymns, have, been, preserved, the, pestlied, mentioned, above, an, adaptation, of, psalm, 65, c, 1525, and, the, kappeler, lied, which, is, believed, to, have, been, composed, during, the, campaign, of, the, first, war, of, kappel, 1529, these, songs, were, not, meant, to, be, sung, during, worship, services, and, are, not, identified, as, hymns, of, the, reformation, though, they, were, published, in, some, 16th, century, hymnals, zwingli, criticized, the, practice, of, priestly, chanting, and, monastic, choirs, the, criticism, dates, from, 1523, when, he, attacked, certain, worship, practices, his, arguments, are, detailed, in, the, conclusions, of, 1525, in, which, conclusions, 44, 45, and, 46, are, concerned, with, musical, practices, under, the, rubric, of, prayer, he, associated, music, with, images, and, vestments, all, of, which, he, felt, diverted, people, s, attention, from, true, spiritual, worship, it, is, not, known, what, he, thought, of, the, musical, practices, in, early, lutheran, churches, zwingli, however, eliminated, instrumental, music, from, worship, in, the, church, stating, that, god, had, not, commanded, it, in, worship, the, organist, of, the, people, s, church, in, z, rich, is, recorded, as, weeping, upon, seeing, the, great, organ, broken, up, although, zwingli, did, not, express, an, opinion, on, congregational, singing, he, made, no, effort, to, encourage, it, nevertheless, scholars, have, found, that, zwingli, was, supportive, of, a, role, for, music, in, the, church, gottfried, w, locher, writes, the, old, assertion, zwingli, was, against, church, singing, holds, good, no, longer, zwingli, s, polemic, is, concerned, exclusively, with, the, medieval, latin, choral, and, priestly, chanting, and, not, with, the, hymns, of, evangelical, congregations, or, choirs, locher, goes, on, to, say, that, zwingli, freely, allowed, vernacular, psalm, or, choral, singing, in, addition, he, even, seems, to, have, striven, for, lively, antiphonal, unison, recitative, locher, then, summarizes, his, comments, on, zwingli, s, view, of, church, music, as, follows, the, chief, thought, in, his, conception, of, worship, was, always, conscious, attendance, and, understanding, devotion, yet, with, the, lively, participation, of, all, concerned, zwingli, was, a, humanist, and, a, scholar, with, many, devoted, friends, and, disciples, he, communicated, as, easily, with, the, ordinary, people, of, his, congregation, as, with, rulers, such, as, philip, of, hesse, his, reputation, as, a, stern, stolid, reformer, is, counterbalanced, by, the, fact, that, he, had, an, excellent, sense, of, humour, and, used, satiric, fables, spoofing, and, puns, in, his, writings, he, was, more, conscious, of, social, obligations, than, was, luther, and, he, genuinely, believed, that, the, masses, would, accept, a, government, guided, by, god, s, word, he, tirelessly, promoted, assistance, to, the, poor, who, he, believed, should, be, cared, for, by, a, truly, christian, community, in, december, 1531, the, z, rich, council, selected, heinrich, bullinger, 1504, 1575, as, zwingli, s, successor, bullinger, immediately, removed, any, doubts, about, zwingli, s, orthodoxy, and, defended, him, as, a, prophet, and, a, martyr, during, bullinger, s, ascendancy, the, confessional, divisions, of, the, swiss, confederation, stabilised, bullinger, rallied, the, reformed, cities, and, cantons, and, helped, them, to, recover, from, the, defeat, at, kappel, zwingli, had, instituted, fundamental, reforms, bullinger, consolidated, and, refined, them, scholars, have, found, it, difficult, to, assess, zwingli, s, impact, on, history, for, several, reasons, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, definition, of, zwinglianism, by, any, definition, zwinglianism, evolved, under, his, successor, heinrich, bullinger, and, research, into, zwingli, s, influence, on, bullinger, and, john, calvin, remains, rudimentary, bullinger, adopted, most, of, zwingli, s, points, of, doctrine, like, zwingli, he, summarised, his, theology, several, times, the, best, known, example, being, the, second, helvetic, confession, of, 1566, meanwhile, calvin, had, taken, over, the, reformation, in, geneva, calvin, differed, with, zwingli, on, the, eucharist, and, criticised, him, for, regarding, it, as, simply, a, metaphorical, event, in, 1549, however, bullinger, and, calvin, succeeded, in, overcoming, the, differences, in, doctrine, and, produced, the, consensus, tigurinus, z, rich, consensus, they, declared, that, the, eucharist, was, not, just, symbolic, of, the, meal, but, they, also, rejected, the, lutheran, position, that, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, is, in, union, with, the, elements, with, this, rapprochement, calvin, established, his, role, in, the, swiss, reformed, churches, and, eventually, in, the, wider, world, the, swiss, reformed, churches, count, zwingli, as, their, founder, as, does, the, reformed, church, in, the, united, states, both, its, present, liberal, and, conservative, descendant, denominations, with, the, former, taking, a, historical, critical, interpretation, of, zwinglian, theology, and, using, it, as, a, basis, for, ecumenism, and, the, latter, interpreting, his, teachings, as, binding, upon, consciences, and, in, effect, as, inerrant, as, scripture, itself, according, to, 19th, century, rcus, historian, j, i, good, scholars, speculate, as, to, why, zwinglianism, has, not, diffused, more, widely, even, though, zwingli, s, theology, is, considered, the, first, expression, of, reformed, theology, although, his, name, is, not, widely, recognised, zwingli, s, legacy, lives, on, in, the, basic, confessions, of, the, reformed, churches, of, today, he, is, often, called, after, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, the, third, man, of, the, reformation, in, 2019, the, swiss, director,
