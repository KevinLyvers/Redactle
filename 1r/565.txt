instead, opting, for, outlining, the, time, in, shuffling, hard, bop, fashion, while, maintaining, a, strong, downbeat, there, are, clear, audible, musical, similarities, between, kuti, s, compositions, and, the, work, of, electric, era, miles, davis, sly, stone, and, afrofunk, pioneer, orlando, julius, kuti, s, band, was, notable, for, featuring, two, baritone, saxophones, when, most,

two, bassists, at, the, same, time, both, playing, interlocking, melodies, and, rhythms, there, were, always, two, or, more, guitarists, the, electric, west, african, style, guitar, in, afrobeat, bands, is, a, key, part, of, the, sound, and, is, used, to, give, basic, structure, playing, a, repeating, chordal, melodic, statement, riff, or, groove, some, elements, often, present, in, kuti, s, music, are, the, call, and, response, within, the, chorus, and, figurative, but, simple, lyrics, his, songs, were, also, very, long, at, least, 10, 15, minutes, in, length, and, many, reached, 20, or, 30, minutes, while, some, unreleased, tracks, would, last, up, to, 45, minutes, when, performed, live, their, length, was, one, of, many, reasons, that, his, music, never, reached, a, substantial, degree, of, popularity, outside, africa, his, lp, records, frequently, had, one, 30, minute, track, per, side, typically, there, is, an, instrumental, introduction, jam, section, of, the, song, roughly, 10, 15, minutes, long, before, kuti, starts, singing, the, main, part, of, the, song, featuring, his, lyrics, and, singing, for, another, 10, 15, minutes, on, some, recordings, his, songs, are, divided, into, two, parts, part, 1, being, the, instrumental, and, part, 2, adding, in, vocals, kuti, s, songs, are, mostly, sung, in, nigerian, pidgin, english, although, he, also, performed, a, few, songs, in, the, yoruba, language, his, main, instruments, were, the, saxophone, and, the, keyboards, but, he, also, played, the, trumpet, electric, guitar, and, the, occasional, drum, solo, kuti, refused, to, perform, songs, again, after, he, had, already, recorded, them, which, hindered, his, popularity, outside, africa, the, subject, of, kuti, s, songs, tended, to, be, very, complex, they, regularly, challenged, common, received, notions, in, the, manner, of, political, commentary, through, song, many, of, his, songs, also, expressed, a, form, of, parody, and, satire, the, main, theme, he, conveyed, through, his, music, was, the, search, for, justice, through, exploration, of, political, and, social, topics, that, affected, the, common, people, kuti, was, known, for, his, showmanship, and, his, concerts, were, often, outlandish, and, wild, he, referred, to, his, stage, act, as, the, underground, spiritual, game, many, expected, him, to, perform, shows, like, those, in, the, western, world, but, during, the, 1980s, he, was, not, interested, in, putting, on, a, show, his, european, performance, was, a, representation, of, what, was, relevant, at, the, time, and, his, other, inspirations, he, attempted, to, make, a, movie, but, lost, all, the, materials, to, the, fire, that, was, set, to, his, house, by, the, military, government, in, power, he, thought, that, art, and, thus, his, own, music, should, have, political, meaning, kuti, s, concerts, also, regularly, involved, female, singers, and, dancers, later, dubbed, as, queens, the, queens, were, women, who, helped, influence, the, popularization, of, his, music, they, were, dressed, colorfully, and, wore, makeup, all, over, their, bodies, that, expressed, their, visual, creativity, the, singers, of, the, group, played, a, backup, role, for, kuti, usually, echoing, his, words, or, humming, along, while, the, dancers, would, put, on, a, performance, of, an, erotic, manner, this, began, to, spark, controversy, due, to, the, nature, of, their, involvement, with, kuti, s, political, tone, along, with, the, reality, that, a, lot, of, the, women, were, young, kuti, was, part, of, an, afrocentric, consciousness, movement, that, was, founded, on, and, delivered, through, his, music, in, an, interview, included, in, hank, bordowitz, s, noise, of, the, world, kuti, stated, music, is, supposed, to, have, an, effect, if, you, re, playing, music, and, people, don, t, feel, something, you, re, not, doing, shit, that, s, what, african, music, is, about, when, you, hear, something, you, must, move, i, want, to, move, people, to, dance, but, also, to, think, music, wants, to, dictate, a, better, life, against, a, bad, life, when, you, re, listening, to, something, that, depicts, having, a, better, life, and, you, re, not, having, a, better, life, it, must, have, an, effect, on, you, kuti, was, highly, engaged, in, political, activism, in, africa, from, the, 1970s, until, his, death, he,
