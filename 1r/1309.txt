sardinia, it, was, well, known, that, the, union, of, france, and, spain, under, one, monarch, would, upset, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, and, that, other, european, powers, would, take, steps, to, prevent, it, philip, s, accession, in, spain, provoked, the, 13, year, war, of, the, spanish, succession, which, continued, until, the, treaty, of, utrecht, forbade, any, future, possibility, of, unifying, the, french, and, spanish, crowns, while, confirming, his, accession, to, the, throne, of, spain, it, also, removed, the, spanish, netherlands, and, spanish, controlled,

been, generally, criticized, by, historians, though, some, praise, is, occasionally, offered, for, his, reforms, historian, stanley, g, payne, wrote, that, felipe, v, was, a, neurotic, vacillating, ruler, concerned, with, outward, decorum, and, brave, only, in, battle, he, had, little, sense, of, spanish, interests, and, needs, philip, was, born, on, 19, december, 1683, at, the, palace, of, versailles, in, france, the, second, son, of, louis, grand, dauphin, the, heir, apparent, to, the, throne, of, france, and, his, wife, maria, anna, victoria, of, bavaria, philip, was, a, younger, brother, of, louis, duke, of, burgundy, the, father, of, louis, xv, of, france, at, birth, philip, was, created, duke, of, anjou, a, traditional, title, for, younger, sons, in, the, french, royal, family, he, would, be, known, by, this, name, until, he, became, the, king, of, spain, since, philip, s, older, brother, the, duke, of, burgundy, was, second, in, line, to, the, french, throne, after, his, father, there, was, little, expectation, that, either, he, or, his, younger, brother, charles, duke, of, berry, would, ever, rule, over, france, philip, lived, his, first, years, under, the, supervision, of, the, royal, governess, louise, de, prie, and, after, that, was, tutored, with, his, brothers, by, fran, ois, f, nelon, archbishop, of, cambrai, the, three, siblings, were, also, educated, by, paul, de, beauvilliers, in, 1700, king, charles, ii, of, spain, the, last, habsburg, to, rule, spain, died, childless, his, will, named, as, successor, philip, grandson, of, charles, half, sister, maria, theresa, the, first, wife, of, louis, xiv, upon, any, possible, refusal, the, crown, of, spain, would, be, offered, next, to, philip, s, younger, brother, the, duke, of, berry, then, to, the, archduke, charles, of, austria, later, holy, roman, emperor, charles, vi, philip, had, the, better, genealogical, claim, to, the, spanish, throne, because, his, spanish, grandmother, and, great, grandmother, were, older, than, the, ancestors, of, the, archduke, charles, of, austria, however, the, austrians, maintained, that, philip, s, grandmother, had, renounced, the, spanish, throne, for, herself, and, her, descendants, as, part, of, her, marriage, contract, that, renunciation, was, contingent, on, her, dowry, being, paid, the, french, claim, to, spain, was, due, to, the, dowry, having, never, been, paid, in, addition, to, this, while, philip, did, have, a, remote, claim, to, the, throne, of, france, archduke, charles, had, an, even, more, proximate, claim, to, be, holy, roman, emperor, and, his, ascension, to, the, throne, would, have, also, destabilized, the, european, balance, of, power, after, a, long, royal, council, meeting, in, france, at, which, the, dauphin, spoke, up, in, favor, of, his, son, s, rights, it, was, agreed, that, philip, would, ascend, the, throne, and, in, doing, so, forfeit, his, and, his, heirs, claim, to, the, throne, of, france, the, royal, council, decided, to, accept, the, provisions, of, the, will, of, charles, ii, naming, philip, king, of, spain, 2, november, 1701, the, almost, 18, year, old, philip, married, the, 13, year, old, maria, luisa, of, savoy, as, chosen, by, his, grandfather, king, louis, xiv, she, was, the, daughter, of, victor, amadeus, ii, duke, of, savoy, and, his, wife, anne, marie, d, orl, ans, philip, s, first, cousin, once, removed, the, duke, and, duchess, of, savoy, were, also, the, parents, of, princess, marie, ad, la, de, of, savoy, duchess, of, burgundy, philip, s, sister, in, law, there, was, a, proxy, ceremony, at, turin, the, capital, of, the, duchy, of, savoy, and, another, one, at, versailles, on, 11, september, maria, luisa, proved, very, popular, as, queen, of, spain, she, served, as, regent, for, her, husband, on, several, occasions, her, most, successful, term, was, when, philip, was, away, touring, his, italian, domains, for, nine, months, in, 1702, when, she, was, just, 14, years, old, on, entering, naples, that, year, he, was, presented, with, bernini, s, boy, with, a, dragon, in, 1714, maria, luisa, died, at, the, age, of, 26, from, tuberculosis, a, devastating, emotional, blow, to, her, husband, the, actions, of, louis, xiv, heightened, the, fears, of, the, english, the, dutch, and, the, austrians, among, others, in, december, 1700, louis, xiv, issued, letters, patent, to, philip, prior, to, philip, leaving, france, preserving, his, status, as, a, r, gnicole, a, natural, frenchman, and, by, extension, his, claim, to, the, french, throne, despite, his, permanent, departure, from, france, the, documents, further, granted, philip, s, male, heirs, status, as, r, gnicoles, and, therefore, as, french, dynasts, despite, their, births, abroad, almost, immediately, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, began, concern, among, other, european, powers, that, spain, and, france, united, under, a, single, bourbon, monarch, would, upset, the, balance, of, power, pitted, france, and, spain, against, the, grand, alliance, of, england, the, dutch, republic, and, austria, inside, spain, the, crown, of, castile, supported, philip, of, france, on, the, other, hand, anti, french, sentiment, was, strong, in, aragon, and, some, members, of, the, nobility, of, the, crown, of, aragon, rallied, behind, charles, of, austria, son, of, holy, roman, emperor, leopold, i, and, claimant, to, the, spanish, throne, by, right, of, his, grandmother, maria, anna, of, spain, their, support, swayed, a, significant, portion, of, the, population, to, support, the, archduke, the, war, was, centred, in, spain, and, west, central, europe, especially, the, low, countries, with, other, important, fighting, in, germany, and, italy, prince, eugene, of, savoy, and, the, duke, of, marlborough, distinguished, themselves, as, military, commanders, in, the, low, countries, in, colonial, north, america, the, conflict, became, known, to, the, english, colonists, who, fought, against, french, and, spanish, forces, as, queen, anne, s, war, over, the, course, of, the, fighting, some, 400, 000, people, were, killed, it, was, with, this, war, as, a, backdrop, that, beginning, in, 1707, philip, issued, the, nueva, planta, decrees, which, centralized, spanish, rule, under, the, castilian, political, and, administrative, model, and, in, the, process, abolished, the, charters, of, all, independently, administered, kingdoms, within, spain, most, notably, the, crown, of, aragon, which, was, supporting, charles, vi, in, the, conflict, except, for, the, kingdom, of, navarre, and, the, rest, of, the, basque, region, who, had, supported, philip, in, the, war, for, the, spanish, throne, and, retained, their, semi, autonomous, self, government, the, policy, of, centralization, had, as, model, the, french, state, under, louis, xiv, and, was, strongly, supported, by, politicians, such, as, joseph, de, sol, s, and, the, sardinian, political, philosopher, vicente, bacallar, philip, agreed, to, relinquish, his, right, of, succession, to, france, under, one, condition, the, introduction, of, semi, salic, law, in, spain, under, this, law, the, succession, to, the, spanish, crown, was, limited, to, his, entire, male, line, before, it, could, pass, to, any, female, a, requirement, made, clear, to, the, allies, during, the, preliminary, peace, negotiations, the, purpose, of, this, may, have, been, to, ensure, that, philip, and, his, male, heirs, who, under, normal, circumstances, would, inherit, the, french, throne, should, the, male, line, of, louis, duke, of, burgundy, be, extinguished, would, always, have, a, throne, to, occupy, in, its, place, it, was, not, until, this, was, successfully, accomplished, 10, may, 1713, that, spain, and, great, britain, made, their, own, peace, terms, at, the, second, treaty, of, utrecht, annexing, the, new, law, to, the, treaty, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, utrecht, that, concluded, the, war, philip, was, recognized, as, king, of, spain, but, was, forced, to, cede, menorca, and, gibraltar, to, great, britain, the, spanish, netherlands, naples, milan, and, sicily, to, the, austrian, habsburgs, and, sardinia, and, parts, of, milan, to, savoy, to, further, ensure, the, removal, of, philip, and, his, heirs, from, the, french, succession, the, letters, patent, issued, to, preserve, their, claim, to, the, throne, despite, their, absence, from, the, country, were, repealed, by, the, french, parliament, these, losses, greatly, diminished, the, spanish, empire, in, europe, which, had, already, been, in, decline, throughout, his, reign, philip, sought, to, reverse, the, decline, of, spanish, power, trying, to, overturn, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, utrecht, he, attempted, to, re, establish, spanish, claims, in, italy, triggering, the, war, of, the, quadruple, alliance, 1718, 1720, in, which, spain, fought, a, coalition, of, four, major, powers, phillip, v, was, forced, to, sue, for, peace, shortly, after, the, death, of, queen, maria, luisa, in, 1714, the, king, decided, to, marry, again, his, second, wife, was, elisabeth, of, parma, daughter, of, odoardo, farnese, hereditary, prince, of, parma, and, dorothea, sophie, of, the, palatinate, at, the, age, of, 22, on, 24, december, 1714, she, was, married, to, the, 31, year, old, philip, by, proxy, in, parma, the, marriage, was, arranged, by, cardinal, alberoni, with, the, concurrence, of, the, princesse, des, ursins, the, camarera, mayor, de, palacio, chief, of, the, household, of, the, king, of, spain, they, had, sons, including, another, successor, charles, iii, of, spain, on, 14, january, 1724, philip, abdicated, the, spanish, throne, to, his, eldest, son, the, seventeen, year, old, louis, as, the, abdication, occurred, just, over, a, month, after, the, death, of, the, duke, of, orl, ans, who, had, been, regent, for, louis, xv, of, france, many, at, the, time, believed, it, was, an, attempt, by, philip, to, circumvent, the, treaty, of, utrecht, which, forbade, a, union, of, the, french, and, spanish, crowns, therefore, allowing, him, to, claim, the, former, should, his, young, nephew, perish, without, sons, of, his, own, however, the, actual, reason, for, the, abdication, was, that, philip, who, exhibited, many, elements, of, mental, instability, during, his, reign, no, longer, wished, to, rule, due, to, his, increasing, mental, decline, louis, would, die, on, 31, august, in, madrid, of, smallpox, though, having, reigned, only, seven, months, and, leaving, no, issue, six, days, later, after, much, convincing, philip, was, restored, to, the, spanish, throne, so, as, to, avoid, a, regency, for, his, second, son, ferdinand, who, was, only, 10, at, the, time, philip, helped, his, bourbon, relatives, to, make, territorial, gains, in, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, and, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, by, reconquering, naples, and, sicily, from, austria, and, oran, from, the, ottomans, finally, at, the, end, of, his, reign, spanish, forces, defended, their, american, territories, from, a, large, british, invasion, during, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, 1739, 1748, during, philip, s, reign, spain, began, to, recover, from, the, stagnation, it, had, suffered, during, the, twilight, of, the, spanish, habsburg, dynasty, although, the, population, of, spain, grew, the, financial, and, taxation, systems, were, archaic, and, the, treasury, ran, deficits, the, king, employed, thousands, of, highly, paid, retainers, at, his, palaces, not, to, assist, with, ruling, the, country, but, to, look, after, the, royal, family, meanwhile, the, army, and, bureaucracy, went, months, without, pay, it, was, only, the, shipments, of, silver, from, the, new, world, which, kept, the, system, going, spain, suspended, payments, on, its, debt, in, 1739, effectively, declaring, bankruptcy, in, the, last, decade, of, his, reign, philip, experienced, bouts, of, manic, depression, and, increasingly, fell, victim, to, a, deep, melancholia, during, this, period, his, second, wife, elizabeth, farnese, seems, to, have, dedicated, herself, exclusively, to, caring, for, his, health, beginning, in, august, 1737, his, mental, illness, was, eased, by, the, castrato, singer, farinelli, who, became, the, musico, de, camara, of, their, majesties, farinelli, would, sing, eight, or, nine, arias, for, the, king, and, queen, every, night, usually, with, a, trio, of, musicians, philip, was, struck, by, a, stroke, and, died, on, 9, july, 1746, in, el, escorial, in, madrid, but, was, buried, in, his, favorite, royal, palace, of, la, granja, de, san, ildefonso, near, segovia, ferdinand, vi, of, spain, his, son, by, his, first, queen, maria, luisa, of, savoy, succeeded, him, historians, have, generally, been, unkind, to, the, king, lynch, says, philip, v, advanced, the, government, only, marginally, over, that, of, his, predecessors, and, was, more, of, a, liability, than, charles, ii, when, a, conflict, came, up, between, the, interests, of, spain, and, france, he, usually, favored, france, however, philip, did, make, some, reforms, in, government, and, strengthened, the, central, authorities, relative, to, the, provinces, merit, became, more, important, although, most, senior, positions, still, went, to, the, landed, aristocracy, below, the, elite, level, the, inefficiency, and, corruption, that, had, existed, under, charles, ii, was, as, widespread, as, ever, the, reforms, started, by, philip, v, culminated, in, much, more, important, reforms, of, charles, iii, the, economy, on, the, whole, improved, over, the, previous, half, century, with, greater, productivity, and, fewer, famines, and, epidemics, the, government, promoted, industry, agriculture, and, shipbuilding, after, the, destruction, of, the, main, silver, fleet, at, vigo, in, 1702, the, navy, was, rebuilt, nevertheless, the, new, fleet, was, still, too, small, to, support, the, vast, worldwide, empire, to, commemorate, the, indignities, the, city, of, x, tiva, suffered, after, philip, s, victory, in, the, battle, of, almansa, in, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, which, he, ordered, the, city, to, be, burned, and, renamed, san, felipe, the, portrait, of, the, monarch, hangs, upside, down, in, the, local, museum, of, l, almod, the, province, of, the, new, philippines, which, occupied, parts, of, what, is, now, texas, in, the, united, states, was, named, in, 1716, in, honor, of, philip, philip, v, favored, and, promoted, the, atlantic, trade, of, spain, with, its, american, possessions, ending, the, monopoly, of, seville, on, colonial, trade, during, this, atlantic, trade, emerged, important, figures, of, the, naval, history, of, spain, among, which, stands, out, the, corsair, amaro, pargo, philip, v, frequently, benefited, the, corsair, in, his, commercial, incursions, he, granted, a, royal, order, given, at, the, royal, palace, of, el, pardo, in, madrid, in, september, 1714, in, which, he, appointed, him, captain, of, a, commercial, ship, bound, for, caracas, the, monarch, also, interceded, in, the, liberation, of, amaro, during, his, detention, by, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, of, c, diz, and, authorized, him, to, build, a, ship, bound, for, campeche, which, was, armed,
