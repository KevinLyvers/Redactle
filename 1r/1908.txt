his, playing, career, he, admitted, to, having, harems, of, women, and, talked, openly, about, his, sexual, activities, because, he, was, convinced, that, heterosexuals, needed, to, know, that, they,

and, johnson, was, earning, as, much, as, 365, 000, per, game, johnson, played, with, the, team, frequently, over, the, next, several, years, with, possibly, the, most, memorable, game, occurring, in, november, 2001, at, the, age, of, 42, johnson, played, with, the, all, stars, against, his, alma, mater, michigan, state, although, he, played, in, a, celebrity, game, to, honor, coach, jud, heathcoate, in, 1995, this, was, johnson, s, first, meaningful, game, played, in, his, hometown, of, lansing, in, 22, years, playing, in, front, of, a, sold, out, arena, johnson, had, a, triple, double, and, played, the, entire, game, but, his, all, star, team, lost, to, the, spartans, by, two, points, johnson, s, half, court, shot, at, the, buzzer, would, have, won, the, game, but, it, fell, short, on, november, 1, 2002, johnson, returned, to, play, a, second, exhibition, game, against, michigan, state, playing, with, the, canberra, cannons, of, australia, s, national, basketball, league,

season, was, composed, of, 80, normal, games, and, two, lakers, celtics, games, similarly, bird, admitted, that, johnson, s, daily, box, score, was, the, first, thing, he, checked, in, the, morning, several, journalists, hypothesized, that, the, johnson, bird, rivalry, was, so, appealing, because, it, represented, many, other, contrasts, such, as, the, clash, between, the, lakers, and, celtics, between, hollywood, flashiness, showtime, and, boston, indiana, blue, collar, grit, celtic, pride, and, between, blacks, and, whites, the, rivalry, was, also, significant, because, it, drew, national, attention, to, the, faltering, nba, prior, to, johnson, and, bird, s, arrival, the, nba, had, gone, through, a, decade, of, declining, interest, and, low, tv, ratings, with, the, two, future, hall, of, famers, the, league, won, a, whole, generation, of, new, fans, drawing, both, traditionalist, adherents, of, bird, s, dirt, court, indiana, game, and, those, appreciative, of, johnson, s, public,

as, a, mix, of, no, look, passes, off, the, fast, break, pin, point, alley, oops, from, halfcourt, spinning, feeds, and, overhand, bullets, under, the, basket, through, triple, teams, fellow, lakers, guard, michael, cooper, said, there, have, been, times, when, has, thrown, passes, and, i, wasn, t, sure, where, he, was, going, then, one, of, our, guys, catches, the, ball, and, scores, and, i, run, back, up, the, floor, convinced, that, he, must, ve, thrown, it, through, somebody, johnson, could, dominate, a, game, without, scoring, running, the, offense, and, distributing, the, ball, with, flair, in, the, 1982, nba, finals, he, was, named, the, finals, mvp, averaging, just, 16, 2, points, the, lowest, average, of, any, finals, mvp, award, recipient, in, the, three, point, shot, era,
