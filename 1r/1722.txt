luigi, galvani, l, v, n, i, also, us, l, italian, latin, aloysius, galvanus, 9, september, 1737, 4, december, 1798, was, an, italian, physician, physicist, biologist, and, philosopher, who, studied, animal, electricity, in, 1780, he, discovered, that, the, muscles, of, dead, frogs, legs, twitched, when, struck, by, an, electrical, spark, 67, 71, this, was, an, early, study, of, bioelectricity, following, experiments, by, john, walsh, and, hugh, williamson, luigi, galvani, was, born, to, domenico, galvani, and, barbara, caterina, foschi, in, bologna, then, part, of, the, papal, states, the, house, in, which, he, was, born, may, still, be, seen, on, via, marconi, 25, in, the, center, of, bologna, domenico, was, a, goldsmith, his, family, had, produced, several, illustrious, men, galvani, then, began, taking, an, interest, in, the, field, of, medical, electricity, this, field, emerged, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, following, electrical, researches, and, the, discovery, of, the, effects, of, electricity, on, the, human, body, by, scientists, including, bertrand, bajon, and, ram, n, m, termeyer, in, the, 1760s, and, by, john, walsh, and, hugh, williamson, in, the, 1770s, alessandro, volta, a, professor, of, experimental, physics, in, the, university, of, pavia, was, among, the, first, scientists, who, repeated, and, checked, galvani, s, experiments, at, first, he, embraced, animal, electricity, however, he, started, to, doubt, that, the, conductions, were, caused, by, specific, electricity, intrinsic, to, the, animal, s, legs, or, other, body, parts, volta, believed, that, the, contractions, depended, on, the, metal, cable, galvani, used, to, connect, the, nerves, and, muscles, in, his, experiments, every, cell, has, a, cell, potential, biological, electricity, has, the, same, chemical, underpinnings, as, the, current, between, electrochemical, cells, and, thus, can, be, duplicated, outside, the, body, volta, s, intuition, was, correct, volta, essentially, objected, to, galvani, s, conclusions, about, animal, electric, fluid, but, the, two, scientists, disagreed, respectfully, and, volta, coined, the, term, galvanism, for, a, direct, current, of, electricity, produced, by, chemical, action, since, galvani, was, reluctant, to, intervene, in, the, controversy, with, volta, he, trusted, his, nephew, giovanni, aldini, to, act, as, the, main, defender, of, the, theory, of, animal, electricity, galvani, actively, investigated, animal, electricity, until, the, end, of, his, life, the, cisalpine, republic, a, french, client, state, founded, in, 1797, after, the, french, occupation, of, northern, italy, required, every, university, professor, to, swear, loyalty, to, the, new, authority, galvani, who, disagreed, with, the, social, and, political, confusion, refused, to, swear, loyalty, along, with, other, colleagues, this, led, to, the, new, authority, depriving, him, of, all, his, academic, and, public, positions, which, took, every, financial, support, away, galvani, died, peacefully, surrounded, by, his, mother, and, father, in, his, brother, s, house, depressed, and, in, poverty, on, 4, december, 1798, galvani, s, legacy, includes, galvani, according, to, william, fox, was, by, nature, courageous, and, religious, jean, louis, marc, alibert, said, of, galvani, that, he, never, ended, his, lessons, without, exhorting, his, hearers, and, leading, them, back, to, the, idea, of, that, eternal, providence, which, develops, conserves, and, circulates, life, among, so, many, diverse, beings
