opera, after, verdi, he, was, descended, from, a, long, line, of, composers, stemming, from, the, late, baroque, era, though, his, early, work, was, firmly, rooted, in, traditional, late, 19th, century, romantic, italian, opera, he, later, developed, his, work, in, the, realistic, verismo, style, of, which, he, became, one, of, the, leading, exponents, his, most, renowned, works, are, la, boh, me, 1896, tosca, 1900, madama, butterfly, 1904, and, turandot, 1924, all, of, which, are, among, the, most, frequently, performed, and, recorded, of, all, operas, puccini, was, born, giacomo,

a, reputation, throughout, northern, italy, and, his, funeral, was, an, occasion, of, public, mourning, at, which, the, then, famed, composer, giovanni, pacini, conducted, a, requiem, with, the, puccini, family, having, occupied, the, position, of, maestro, di, cappella, for, 124, years, 1740, 1864, by, the, time, of, michele, s, death, it, was, anticipated, that, michele, s, son, giacomo, would, occupy, that, position, as, well, when, he, was, old, enough, however, when, michele, puccini, died, in, 1864, his, son, giacomo, was, only, six, years, old, and, thus, not, capable, of, taking, over, his, father, s, job, as, a, child, he, nevertheless, participated, in, the, musical, life, of, the, cattedrale, di, san, martino, as, a, member, of, the, boys, choir, and, later, as, a, substitute, organist, puccini, was, given, a, general, education, at, the, seminary, of, san, michele, in, lucca, and, then, at, the, seminary, of, the, cathedral, one, of, puccini, s, uncles,

later, with, carlo, angeloni, who, had, also, instructed, alfredo, catalani, a, grant, from, queen, margherita, and, assistance, from, another, uncle, nicholas, cer, provided, the, funds, necessary, for, puccini, to, continue, his, studies, at, the, milan, conservatory, where, he, studied, composition, with, stefano, ronchetti, monteviti, amilcare, ponchielli, amintore, galli, and, antonio, bazzini, puccini, studied, at, the, conservatory, for, three, years, sharing, a, room, with, pietro, mascagni, in, 1880, at, the, age, of, 21, puccini, composed, his, mass, which, marks, the, culmination, of, his, family, s, long, association, with, church, music, in, his, native, lucca, puccini, wrote, an, orchestral, piece, called, the, capriccio, sinfonico, as, a, thesis, composition, for, the, milan, conservatory, puccini, s, teachers, ponchielli, and, bazzini, were, impressed, by, the, work, and, it, was, performed, at, a, student, concert, at, the, conservatory, on, 14, july, 1883, conducted, by, franco, faccio, puccini, s, work, was, favourably, reviewed, in, the, milanese, publication, la, perseveranza, and, thus, puccini, began, to, build, a, reputation, as, a, young, composer, of, promise, in, milanese, music, circles, after, the, premiere, of, the, capriccio, sinfonico, ponchielli, and, puccini, discussed, the, possibility, that, puccini, s, next, work, might, be, an, opera, ponchielli, invited, puccini, to, stay, at, his, villa, where, puccini, was, introduced, to, ferdinando, fontana, puccini, and, fontana, agreed, to, collaborate, on, an, opera, for, which, fontana, would, provide, the, libretto, puccini, submitted, the, work, titled, le, villi, the, fairies, for, casa, musicale, sonzogno, s, first, of, four, musical, competitions, advertised, in, april, 1883, for, a, new, unperformed, opera, inspired, by, the, best, traditions, of, italian, opera, which, could, be, idyllic, serious, or, comic, to, be, judged, by, a, panel, including, galli, and, ponchielli, puccini, s, submission, was, disqualified, because, its, manuscript, was, illegible, the, second, competition, in, 1889, was, notably, won, by, mascagni, s, cavalleria, rusticana, despite, the, defeat, in, the, competition, le, villi, was, later, staged, at, the, teatro, dal, verme, premiering, on, 31, may, 1884, casa, ricordi, assisted, with, the, premier, by, printing, the, libretto, without, charge, fellow, students, from, the, milan, conservatory, formed, a, large, part, of, the, orchestra, the, performance, was, enough, of, a, success, that, casa, ricordi, purchased, the, opera, revised, into, a, two, act, version, with, an, intermezzo, between, the, acts, le, villi, was, performed, at, la, scala, in, milan, on, 24, january, 1885, however, ricordi, did, not, publish, the, score, until, 1887, hindering, further, performance, of, the, work, giulio, ricordi, head, of, g, ricordi, co, music, publishers, was, sufficiently, impressed, with, le, villi, and, its, young, composer, that, he, commissioned, a, second, opera, which, would, result, in, edgar, work, was, begun, in, 1884, when, fontana, began, working, out, the, scenario, for, the, libretto, puccini, finished, primary, composition, in, 1887, and, orchestration, in, 1888, edgar, premiered, at, la, scala, on, 21, april, 1889, to, a, lukewarm, response, the, work, was, withdrawn, for, revisions, after, its, third, performance, in, a, milanese, newspaper, giulio, ricordi, published, a, defence, of, puccini, s, skill, as, a, composer, while, criticizing, fontana, s, libretto, a, revised, version, met, with, success, at, the, teatro, del, giglio, in, puccini, s, native, lucca, on, 5, september, 1891, in, 1892, further, revisions, reduced, the, length, of, the, opera, from, four, acts, to, three, in, a, version, that, was, well, received, in, ferrara, and, was, performed, in, turin, and, in, spain, puccini, made, further, revisions, in, 1901, and, 1905, but, the, work, never, achieved, popularity, without, the, personal, support, of, ricordi, edgar, might, have, cost, puccini, his, career, puccini, had, eloped, with, his, former, piano, student, the, married, elvira, gemignani, and, ricordi, s, associates, were, willing, to, turn, a, blind, eye, to, his, lifestyle, as, long, as, he, was, successful, when, edgar, failed, they, suggested, to, ricordi, that, he, should, drop, puccini, but, ricordi, said, that, he, would, stay, with, him, and, continued, his, allowance, until, his, next, opera, on, commencing, his, next, opera, manon, lescaut, puccini, announced, that, he, would, write, his, own, libretto, so, that, no, fool, of, a, librettist, could, spoil, it, ricordi, persuaded, him, to, accept, ruggero, leoncavallo, as, his, librettist, but, puccini, soon, asked, ricordi, to, remove, him, from, the, project, four, other, librettists, were, then, involved, with, the, opera, as, puccini, constantly, changed, his, mind, about, the, structure, of, the, piece, it, was, almost, by, accident, that, the, final, two, luigi, illica, and, giuseppe, giacosa, came, together, to, complete, the, opera, manon, lescaut, premiered, at, the, teatro, regio, in, turin, on, 2, february, 1893, by, coincidence, puccini, s, first, enduringly, popular, opera, appeared, within, a, week, of, the, premiere, of, verdi, s, last, opera, falstaff, which, was, first, performed, on, 9, february, 1893, in, anticipation, of, the, premiere, la, stampa, wrote, that, puccini, was, a, young, man, concerning, whom, great, hopes, had, a, real, basis, un, giovane, che, tra, i, pochi, sul, quale, le, larghe, speranze, non, siano, benigne, illusioni, because, of, the, failure, of, edgar, however, a, failure, of, manon, lescaut, could, have, jeopardized, puccini, s, future, as, a, composer, although, giulio, ricordi, head, of, casa, ricordi, was, supportive, of, puccini, while, manon, lescaut, was, still, in, development, the, casa, ricordi, board, of, directors, was, considering, cutting, off, puccini, s, financial, support, in, any, event, manon, lescaut, was, puccini, s, first, and, only, uncontested, triumph, acclaimed, by, critics, and, public, alike, after, the, london, premiere, in, 1894, george, bernard, shaw, pronounced, puccini, looks, to, me, more, like, the, heir, of, verdi, than, any, of, his, rivals, manon, lescaut, was, a, great, success, and, established, puccini, s, reputation, as, the, most, promising, rising, composer, of, his, generation, and, the, most, likely, successor, to, verdi, as, the, leading, exponent, of, the, italian, operatic, tradition, illica, and, giacosa, returned, as, librettists, for, puccini, for, his, next, three, operas, probably, his, greatest, successes, la, boh, me, tosca, and, madama, butterfly, puccini, s, next, work, after, manon, lescaut, was, la, boh, me, a, four, act, opera, based, on, the, 1851, book, by, henri, murger, la, vie, de, boh, me, la, boh, me, premiered, in, turin, in, 1896, conducted, by, arturo, toscanini, within, a, few, years, it, had, been, performed, in, many, of, the, leading, opera, houses, of, europe, including, in, britain, as, well, as, in, the, united, states, it, was, a, popular, success, and, remains, one, of, the, most, frequently, performed, operas, ever, written, the, libretto, of, the, opera, freely, adapted, from, murger, s, episodic, novel, combines, comic, elements, of, the, impoverished, life, of, the, young, protagonists, with, tragic, aspects, such, as, the, death, of, the, young, seamstress, mim, puccini, s, own, life, as, a, young, man, in, milan, served, as, a, source, of, inspiration, for, elements, of, the, libretto, during, his, years, as, a, conservatory, student, and, in, the, years, before, manon, lescaut, he, experienced, poverty, similar, to, that, of, the, bohemians, in, la, boh, me, including, a, chronic, shortage, of, necessities, like, food, clothing, and, money, to, pay, rent, although, puccini, was, granted, a, small, monthly, stipend, by, the, congregation, of, charity, in, rome, congregazione, di, carit, he, frequently, had, to, pawn, his, possessions, to, cover, basic, expenses, early, biographers, such, as, wakeling, dry, and, eugenio, checchi, who, were, puccini, s, contemporaries, drew, express, parallels, between, these, incidents, and, particular, events, in, the, opera, checchi, cited, a, diary, kept, by, puccini, while, he, was, still, a, student, which, recorded, an, occasion, in, which, as, in, act, 4, of, the, opera, a, single, herring, served, as, a, dinner, for, four, people, puccini, himself, commented, i, lived, that, boh, me, when, there, wasn, t, yet, any, thought, stirring, in, my, brain, of, seeking, the, theme, of, an, opera, quella, boh, me, io, l, ho, vissuta, quando, ancora, non, mi, mulinava, nel, cervello, l, idea, di, cercarvi, l, argomento, per, un, opera, in, musica, puccini, s, composition, of, la, boh, me, was, the, subject, of, a, public, dispute, between, puccini, and, fellow, composer, ruggiero, leoncavallo, in, early, 1893, the, two, composers, discovered, that, they, were, both, engaged, in, writing, operas, based, on, murger, s, work, leoncavallo, had, started, his, work, first, and, he, and, his, music, publisher, claimed, to, have, priority, on, the, subject, although, murger, s, work, was, in, the, public, domain, puccini, responded, that, he, started, his, own, work, without, having, any, knowledge, of, leoncavallo, s, project, and, wrote, let, him, compose, i, will, compose, the, audience, will, decide, puccini, s, opera, premiered, a, year, before, that, of, leoncavallo, and, has, been, a, perennial, audience, favourite, while, leoncavallo, s, version, quickly, faded, into, obscurity, puccini, s, next, work, after, la, boh, me, was, tosca, 1900, arguably, puccini, s, first, foray, into, verismo, the, realistic, depiction, of, many, facets, of, real, life, including, violence, puccini, had, been, considering, an, opera, on, this, theme, since, he, saw, the, play, tosca, by, victorien, sardou, in, 1889, when, he, wrote, to, his, publisher, giulio, ricordi, begging, him, to, get, sardou, s, permission, for, the, work, to, be, made, into, an, opera, i, see, in, this, tosca, the, opera, i, need, with, no, overblown, proportions, no, elaborate, spectacle, nor, will, it, call, for, the, usual, excessive, amount, of, music, the, music, of, tosca, employs, musical, signatures, for, particular, characters, and, emotions, which, have, been, compared, to, wagnerian, leitmotivs, and, some, contemporaries, saw, puccini, as, thereby, adopting, a, new, musical, style, influenced, by, richard, wagner, others, viewed, the, work, differently, rejecting, the, allegation, that, tosca, displayed, wagnerian, influences, a, critic, reporting, on, the, torino, premiere, of, 20, february, 1900, wrote, i, don, t, think, you, could, find, a, more, puccinian, score, than, this, on, 25, february, 1903, puccini, was, seriously, injured, in, a, car, crash, during, a, nighttime, journey, on, the, road, from, lucca, to, torre, del, lago, the, car, was, driven, by, puccini, s, chauffeur, and, was, carrying, puccini, his, future, wife, elvira, and, their, son, antonio, it, went, off, the, road, fell, several, metres, and, flipped, over, elvira, and, antonio, were, flung, from, the, car, and, escaped, with, minor, injuries, puccini, s, chauffeur, also, thrown, from, the, car, suffered, a, serious, fracture, of, his, femur, puccini, was, pinned, under, the, vehicle, with, a, severe, fracture, of, his, right, leg, and, with, a, portion, of, the, car, pressing, down, on, his, chest, a, doctor, living, near, the, scene, of, the, crash, together, with, another, person, who, came, to, investigate, saved, puccini, from, the, wreckage, the, injury, did, not, heal, well, and, puccini, remained, under, treatment, for, months, during, the, medical, examinations, that, he, underwent, it, was, also, found, that, he, was, suffering, from, a, form, of, diabetes, the, accident, and, its, consequences, slowed, puccini, s, completion, of, his, next, work, madama, butterfly, the, original, version, of, madama, butterfly, premiered, at, la, scala, on, 17, february, 1904, with, rosina, storchio, in, the, title, role, it, was, initially, greeted, with, great, hostility, probably, largely, owing, to, inadequate, rehearsals, when, storchio, s, kimono, accidentally, lifted, during, the, performance, some, in, the, audience, started, shouting, the, butterfly, is, pregnant, and, there, is, the, little, toscanini, the, latter, comment, referred, to, her, well, publicised, affair, with, arturo, toscanini, this, version, was, in, two, acts, after, its, disastrous, premiere, puccini, withdrew, the, opera, revising, it, for, what, was, virtually, a, second, premiere, at, brescia, in, may, 1904, and, performances, in, buenos, aires, london, the, us, and, paris, in, 1907, puccini, made, his, final, revisions, to, the, opera, in, a, fifth, version, which, has, become, known, as, the, standard, version, today, the, standard, version, of, the, opera, is, the, version, most, often, performed, around, the, world, however, the, original, 1904, version, is, occasionally, performed, as, well, and, has, been, recorded, after, 1904, puccini, s, compositions, were, less, frequent, in, 1906, giacosa, died, and, in, 1909, there, was, a, scandal, after, puccini, s, wife, elvira, falsely, accused, their, maid, doria, manfredi, of, having, an, affair, with, puccini, finally, in, 1912, the, death, of, giulio, ricordi, puccini, s, editor, and, publisher, ended, a, productive, period, of, his, career, puccini, completed, la, fanciulla, del, west, based, on, a, play, by, david, belasco, in, 1910, this, was, commissioned, by, and, first, performed, at, the, metropolitan, opera, in, new, york, on, 10, december, 1910, with, met, stars, enrico, caruso, and, emmy, destinn, for, whom, puccini, created, the, leading, roles, of, dick, johnson, and, minnie, toscanini, then, the, musical, director, of, the, met, conducted, this, was, the, first, world, premiere, of, an, opera, at, the, met, the, premiere, was, a, great, success, however, the, compositional, style, employed, in, the, opera, with, few, stand, alone, arias, was, criticized, at, the, time, some, contemporaries, also, criticized, the, opera, for, failing, to, achieve, an, american, tone, however, the, opera, has, been, acclaimed, for, its, incorporation, of, advanced, harmonic, language, and, rhythmic, complexity, into, the, italian, operatic, form, in, addition, one, aria, from, the, opera, ch, ella, mi, creda, has, become, a, staple, of, compilation, albums, by, operatic, tenors, it, is, said, that, during, world, war, i, italian, soldiers, sang, this, aria, to, maintain, their, spirits, the, 2008, italian, film, puccini, e, la, fanciulla,

1916, after, two, years, of, work, and, it, was, premiered, at, the, grand, th, tre, de, monte, carlo, on, 27, march, 1917, the, opera, had, been, originally, commissioned, by, vienna, s, carltheater, however, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, prevented, the, premiere, from, being, given, there, moreover, the, firm, of, ricordi, had, declined, the, score, of, the, opera, giulio, ricordi, s, son, tito, was, then, in, charge, and, he, described, the, opera, as, bad, leh, r, it, was, taken, up, by, their, rival, lorenzo, sonzogno, who, arranged, the, first, performance, in, neutral, monaco, the, composer, continued, to, work, at, revising, this, the, least, known, of, his, mature, operas, until, his, death, la, rondine, was, initially, conceived, as, an, operetta, but, puccini, eliminated, spoken, dialogue, rendering, the, work, closer, in, form, to, an, opera, a, modern, reviewer, described, la, rondine, as, a, continuous, fabric, of, lilting, waltz, tunes, catchy, pop, styled, melodies, and, nostalgic, love, music, while, characterizing, the, plot, as, recycling, characters, and, incidents, from, works, like, la, traviata, and, die, fledermaus, in, 1918, il, trittico, premiered, in, new, york, this, work, is, composed, of, three, one, act, operas, each, concerning, the, concealment, of, a, death, a, horrific, episode, il, tabarro, in, the, style, of, the, parisian, grand, guignol, a, sentimental, tragedy, suor, angelica, and, a, comedy, gianni, schicchi, turandot, puccini, s, final, opera, was, left, unfinished, at, the, composer, s, death, in, november, 1924, and, the, last, two, scenes, were, completed, by, franco, alfano, based, on, the, composer, s, sketches, the, libretto, for, turandot, was, based, on, a, play, of, the, same, name, by, carlo, gozzi, the, music, of, the, opera, is, heavily, inflected, with, pentatonic, motifs, intended, to, produce, an, asiatic, flavour, to, the, music, turandot, contains, a, number, of, memorable, stand, alone, arias, among, them, nessun, dorma, the, libretto, of, edgar, was, a, significant, factor, in, the, failure, of, that, opera, thereafter, especially, throughout, his, middle, and, late, career, puccini, was, extremely, selective, and, at, times, indecisive, in, his, choice, of, subject, matter, for, new, works, puccini, was, deeply, involved, in, the, process, of, writing, the, libretto, itself, requiring, many, iterative, revisions, of, his, libretti, in, terms, of, both, structure, and, text, puccini, s, relationships, with, his, librettists, were, at, times, very, difficult, his, publisher, casa, ricordi, was, frequently, required, to, mediate, disputes, and, impasses, between, them, puccini, explored, many, possible, subjects, that, he, ultimately, rejected, only, after, a, significant, amount, of, effort, such, as, the, creation, of, a, libretto, had, been, put, into, them, among, the, subjects, that, puccini, seriously, considered, but, abandoned, were, cristoforo, sly, anima, allegra, based, on, the, play, el, genio, alegre, by, seraf, n, and, joaqu, n, lvarez, quintero, two, little, wooden, shoes, i, due, zoccoletti, a, short, story, by, maria, louise, ram, a,

these, abandoned, subjects, were, taken, up, and, turned, into, operas, by, other, composers, for, example, franco, vittadini, made, an, opera, of, anima, allegra, mascagni, s, opera, lodoletta, is, derived, from, two, little, wooden, shoes, and, riccardo, zandonai, eventually, wrote, conchita, from, 1891, onwards, puccini, spent, most, of, his, time, when, not, travelling, on, business, at, torre, del, lago, a, small, community, about, fifteen, miles, from, lucca, situated, between, the, ligurian, sea, and, lake, massaciuccoli, just, south, of, viareggio, torre, del, lago, was, the,

well, known, singers, such, as, maria, jeritza, emmy, destinn, cesira, ferrani, and, hariclea, darcl, e, in, 1906, while, attending, the, opening, of, madama, butterfly, in, budapest, puccini, fell, in, love, with, blanke, lendvai, the, sister, of, hungarian, composer, ervin, lendvai, his, friend, and, prot, g, for, many, years, blanke, and, puccini, exchanged, love, letters, until, 1911, when, he, started, an, affair, with, german, aristocrat, baroness, josephine, von, stangel, which, lasted, for, six, years, in, 1909, puccini, s, wife, elvira, publicly, accused, doria, manfredi, a, maid, working, for, the, puccini, family, of, having, an, affair, with, the, composer, after, the, accusation, manfredi, committed, suicide, however, an, autopsy, determined, that, manfredi, had, died, a, virgin, refuting, the, allegations, made, against, her, elvira, puccini, was, prosecuted, for, slander, and, was, sentenced, to, more, than, five, months, in, prison, although, a, payment, to, the, manfredi, family, by, puccini, spared, elvira, from, having, to, serve, the, sentence, some, music, critics, and, interpreters, of, puccini, s, work, have, speculated, that, the, psychological, effects, of, this, incident, on, puccini, interfered, with, his, ability, to, complete, compositions, later, in, his, career, and, also, influenced, the, development, of, his, characters, such, as, li, from, turandot, a, slave, girl, who, dies, tragically, by, suicide, in, 2007, documents, were, found, in, the, possession, of, nadia, manfredi, a, descendant, of, the, manfredi, family, which, indicated, that, puccini, was, actually, having, an, affair, with, giulia, manfredi, doria, s, cousin, upon, the, discovery, of, these, documents, the, press, began, to, allege, that, puccini, had, fathered, giulia, manfredi, s, son, antonio, which, would, make, nadia, a, granddaughter, of, puccini, unlike, wagner, and, verdi, puccini, was, not, active, in, politics, puccini, biographer, mary, jane, phillips, matz, wrote, throughout, this, entire, period, puccini, s, interest, in, politics, was, close, to, zero, as, it, had, been, all, his, life, so, far, as, one, can, judge, he, seemed, almost, indifferent, to, everything, from, mayoral, elections, in, viareggio, to, cabinet, appointments, in, rome, another, biographer, speculates, that, puccini, may, have, been, if, he, had, a, political, philosophy, a, monarchist, puccini, s, indifference, to, politics, caused, him, problems, during, world, war, i, puccini, s, long, standing, and, close, friendship, with, toscanini, was, interrupted, for, nearly, a, decade, because, of, an, argument, in, the, summer, of, 1914, in, the, opening, months, of, the, war, during, which, puccini, remarked, that, italy, could, benefit, from, german, organization, puccini, was, also, criticized, during, the, war, for, his, work, on, la, rondine, under, a, 1913, commission, contract, with, an, austrian, theater, after, italy, and, austria, hungary, became, opponents, in, the, war, in, 1915, although, the, contract, was, ultimately, cancelled, puccini, did, not, participate, in, the, public, war, effort, but, privately, rendered, assistance, to, individuals, and, families, affected, by, the, war, in, 1919, puccini, was, commissioned, to, write, music, to, an, ode, by, fausto, salvatori, honouring, italy, s, victories, in, world, war, i, the, work, inno, a, roma, hymn, to, rome, was, to, premiere, on, 21, april, 1919, during, a, celebration, of, the, anniversary, of, the, founding, of, rome, the, premiere, was, delayed, to, 1, june, 1919, when, it, was, played, at, the, opening, of, a, gymnastics, competition, although, not, written, for, the, fascists, inno, a, roma, was, widely, played, during, fascist, street, parades, and, public, ceremonies, puccini, had, some, contact, with, benito, mussolini, and, the, italian, fascist, party, in, the, year, preceding, his, death, in, 1923, the, fascist, party, in, viareggio, made, puccini, an, honorary, member, and, sent, him, a, membership, card, however, evidence, that, puccini, was, actually, a, member, of, the, fascist, party, is, ambiguous, the, italian, senate, has, traditionally, included, a, small, number, of, members, appointed, in, recognition, of, their, cultural, contributions, to, the, nation, puccini, hoped, to, attain, this, honour, which, had, been, granted, to, verdi, and, undertook, to, use, his, connections, to, bring, about, the, appointment, while, honorary, senators, could, vote, there, is, no, indication, that, puccini, sought, the, appointment, for, this, purpose, puccini, also, wished, to, establish, a, national, theatre, in, viareggio, a, project, which, would, require, government, support, puccini, met, with, mussolini, twice, in, november, and, december, 1923, seeking, support, for, the, theatre, project, while, the, theatre, project, never, came, to, fruition, puccini, was, named, senator, senatore, a, vita, a, few, months, before, his, death, at, the, time, puccini, met, with, mussolini, mussolini, had, been, prime, minister, for, approximately, a, year, but, his, party, had, not, yet, taken, full, control, of, the, italian, parliament, through, the, violence, and, irregularities, of, the, 1924, general, election, puccini, was, no, longer, alive, when, mussolini, announced, the, end, of, representative, government, and, the, beginning, of, a, fascist, dictatorship, in, his, speech, before, the, chamber, of, deputies, on, 3, january, 1925, a, chain, smoker, of, toscano, cigars, and, cigarettes, puccini, began, to, complain, of, a, chronic, sore, throat, towards, the, end, of, 1923, a, diagnosis, of, throat, cancer, led, his, doctors, to, recommend, a, new, and, experimental, radiation, therapy, treatment, which, was, being, offered, in, brussels, puccini, and, his, wife, never, understood, how, serious, the, cancer, was, as, the, news, was, revealed, only, to, his, son, puccini, died, in, brussels, on, 29, november, 1924, aged, 65, from, complications, after, the, treatment, uncontrolled, bleeding, led, to, a, heart, attack, the, day, after, surgery, news, of, his, death, reached, rome, during, a, performance, of, la, boh, me, the, opera, was, immediately, stopped, and, the, orchestra, played, chopin, s, funeral, march, for, the, stunned, audience, he, was, buried, in, milan, in, toscanini, s, family, tomb, but, that, was, always, intended, as, a, temporary, measure, in, 1926, his, son, arranged, to, transfer, his, father, s, remains, to, a, specially, created, chapel, inside, the, puccini, villa, at, torre, del, lago, most, broadly, puccini, wrote, in, the, style, of, the, late, romantic, period, of, classical, music, see, romantic, music, music, historians, also, refer, to, puccini, as, a, component, of, the, giovane, scuola, young, school, a, cohort, of, composers, who, came, onto, the, italian, operatic, scene, as, verdi, s, career, came, to, an, end, such, as, mascagni, leoncavallo, and, others, mentioned, below, puccini, is, also, frequently, referred, to, as, a, verismo, composer, puccini, s, career, extended, from, the, end, of, the, romantic, period, into, the, modern, period, he, consciously, attempted, to, update, his, style, to, keep, pace, with, new, trends, but, did, not, attempt, to, fully, adopt, a, modern, style, one, critic, andrew, davis, has, stated, loyalty, toward, nineteenth, century, italian, opera, traditions, and, more, generally, toward, the, musical, language, of, his, tuscan, heritage, is, one, of, the, clearest, features, of, puccini, s, music, davis, also, identifies, however, a, stylistic, pluralism, in, puccini, s, work, including, influences, from, the, german, symphonic, tradition, french, harmonic, and, orchestrational, traditions, and, to, a, lesser, extent, aspects, of, wagnerian, chromaticism, in, addition, puccini, frequently, sought, to, introduce, music, or, sounds, from, outside, sources, into, his, operas, such, as, his, use, of, chinese, folk, melodies, in, turandot, all, of, puccini, s, operas, have, at, least, one, set, piece, for, a, lead, singer, that, is, separate, enough, from, its, surroundings, that, it, can, be, treated, as, a, distinct, aria, and, most, of, his, works, have, several, of, these, at, the, same, time, puccini, s, work, continued, the, trend, away, from, operas, constructed, from, a, series, of, set, pieces, and, instead, used, a, more, through, composed, or, integrated, construction, his, works, are, strongly, melodic, in, orchestration, puccini, frequently, doubled, the, vocal, line, in, unison, or, at, octaves, in, order, to, emphasize, and, strengthen, the, melodic, line, verismo, is, a, style, of, italian, opera, that, began, in, 1890, with, the, first, performance, of, mascagni, s, cavalleria, rusticana, peaked, in, the, early, 1900s, and, lingered, into, the, 1920s, the, style, is, distinguished, by, realistic, sometimes, sordid, or, violent, depictions, of, everyday, life, especially, the, life, of, the, contemporary, lower, classes, verismo, does, not, usually, employ, the, historical, or, mythical, subjects, associated, with, romanticism, cavalleria, rusticana, pagliacci, and, andrea, ch, nier, are, uniformly, considered, to, be, verismo, operas, puccini, s, career, as, a, composer, is, almost, entirely, coincident, in, time, with, the, verismo, movement, only, his, le, villi, and, edgar, preceded, cavalleria, rusticana, some, view, puccini, as, essentially, a, verismo, composer, while, others, although, acknowledging, that, he, took, part, in, the, movement, to, some, degree, do, not, view, him, as, a, pure, verismo, composer, in, addition, critics, differ, as, to, the, degree, to, which, particular, operas, by, puccini, are, or, are, not, properly, described, as, verismo, operas, two, of, puccini, s, operas, tosca, and, il, tabarro, are, universally, considered, to, be, verismo, operas, puccini, scholar, mosco, carner, places, only, two, of, puccini, s, operas, other, than, tosca, and, il, tabarro, within, the, verismo, school, madama, butterfly, and, la, fanciulla, del, west, because, only, three, verismo, works, that, were, not, composed, by, puccini, continue, to, appear, regularly, on, stage, the, aforementioned, cavalleria, rusticana, pagliacci, and, andrea, ch, nier, puccini, s, contribution, has, had, lasting, significance, to, the, genre, both, during, his, lifetime, and, in, posterity, puccini, s, success, outstripped, other, italian, opera, composers, of, his, time, and, he, has, been, matched, in, this, regard, by, only, a, handful, of, composers, in, the, entire, history, of, opera, between, 2004, and, 2018, puccini, ranked, third, behind, verdi, and, mozart, in, the, number, of, performances, of, his, operas, worldwide, as, surveyed, by, operabase, three, of, his, operas, la, boh, me, tosca, and, madama, butterfly, were, amongst, the, 10, most, frequently, performed, operas, worldwide, gustav, kobb, the, original, author, of, the, complete, opera, book, a, standard, reference, work, on, opera, wrote, in, the, 1919, edition, puccini, is, considered, the, most, important, figure, in, operatic, italy, today, the, successor, of, verdi, if, there, is, any, other, contemporaries, shared, this, view, italian, opera, composers, of, the, generation, with, whom, puccini, was, compared, included, pietro, mascagni, 1863, 1945, ruggero, leoncavallo, 1857, 1919, umberto, giordano, 1867, 1948, francesco, cilea, 1866, 1950, baron, pierantonio, tasca, 1858, 1934, gaetano, coronaro, 1852, 1908, and, alberto, franchetti, 1860, 1942, only, three, composers, and, three, works, by, italian, contemporaries, of, puccini, appear, on, the, operabase, list, of, most, performed, works, cavalleria, rusticana, by, mascagni, pagliacci, by, ruggero, leoncavallo, and, andrea, ch, nier, by, umberto, giordano, kobb, contrasted, puccini, s, ability, to, achieve, sustained, success, with, the, failure, of, mascagni, and, leoncavallo, to, produce, more, than, merely, one, sensationally, successful, short, opera, by, the, time, of, puccini, s, death, in, 1924, he, had, earned, 4, million, from, his, works, although, the, popular, success, of, puccini, s, work, is, undeniable, and, his, mastery, of, the, craft, of, composition, has, been, consistently, recognized, opinion, among, critics, as, to, the, artistic, value, of, his, work, has, always, been, divided, grove, music, online, described, puccini, s, strengths, as, a, composer, as, follows, puccini, succeeded, in, mastering, the, orchestra, as, no, other, italian, had, done, before, him, creating, new, forms, by, manipulating, structures, inherited, from, the, great, italian, tradition, loading, them, with, bold, harmonic, progressions, which, had, little, or, nothing, to, do, with, what, was, happening, then, in, italy, though, they, were, in, step, with, the, work, of, french, austrian, and, german, colleagues, in, his, work, on, puccini, julian, budden, describes, puccini, as, a, gifted, and, original, composer, noting, the, innovation, hidden, in, the, popularity, of, works, such, as, che, gelida, manina, he, describes, the, aria, in, musical, terms, the, signature, embedded, in, the, harmony, for, example, and, points, out, that, its, structure, was, rather, unheard, of, at, the, time, having, three, distinct, musical, paragraphs, that, nonetheless, form, a, complete, and, coherent, whole, this, gumption, in, musical, experimentation, was, the, essence, of, puccini, s, style, as, evidenced, in, his, diverse, settings, and, use, of, the, motif, to, express, ideas, beyond, those, in, the, story, and, text, puccini, has, however, consistently, been, the, target, of, condescension, by, some, music, critics, who, find, his, music, insufficiently, sophisticated, or, difficult, some, have, explicitly, condemned, his, efforts, to, please, his, audience, such, as, this, contemporary, italian, critic, he, willingly, stops, himself, at, minor, genius, stroking, the, taste, of, the, public, obstinately, shunning, too, daring, innovation, a, little, heroism, but, not, taken, to, great, heights, a, little, bit, of, veristic, comedy, but, brief, a, lot, of, sentiment, and, romantic, idyll, this, is, the, recipe, in, which, he, finds, happiness, gli, si, arresta, volentieri, alla, piccola, genialit, accarezzando, il, gusto, del, pubblico, rifuggendo, ostinato, dalle, troppo, ardite, innovazioni, un, po, di, eroismo, ma, non, spinto, a, grandi, altezze, un, po, di, commedia, verista, ma, breve, molto, idillio, sentimentale, e, romantico, ecco, la, ricetta, in, cui, egli, compiace, budden, attempted, to, explain, the, paradox, of, puccini, s, immense, popular, success, and, technical, mastery, on, the, one, hand, and, the, relative, disregard, in, which, his, work, has, been, held, by, academics, no, composer, communicates, more, directly, with, an, audience, than, puccini, indeed, for, many, years, he, has, remained, a, victim, of, his, own, popularity, hence, the, resistance, to, his, music, in, academic, circles, be, it, remembered, however, that, verdi, s, melodies, were, once, dismissed, as, barrel, organ, fodder, the, truth, is, that, music, that, appeals, immediately, to, a, public, becomes, subject, to, bad, imitation, which, can, cast, a, murky, shadow, over, the, original, so, long, as, counterfeit, puccinian, melody, dominated, the, world, of, sentimental, operetta, many, found, it, difficult, to, come, to, terms, with, the, genuine, article, now, that, the, current, coin, of, light, music, has, changed, the, composer, admired, by, schoenberg, ravel, and, stravinsky, can, be, seen, to, emerge, in, his, full, stature, founded, in, 1996, in, lucca, the, centro, di, studi, giacomo, puccini, embraces, a, wide, range, of, approaches, to, the, study,
