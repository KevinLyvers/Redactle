duchess, of, aquitaine, from, 1137, to, 1204, queen, of, france, from, 1137, to, 1152, as, the, wife, of, king, louis, vii, and, queen, of, england, from, 1154, to, 1189, as, the, wife, of, king, henry, ii, as, the, heiress, of, the, house, of, poitiers, which, controlled, much, of, southwestern, france, she, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, women, in, western, europe, during, the, high, middle, ages, the, eldest, child, of, william, x, duke, of, aquitaine, and, a, nor, de, ch, tellerault, eleanor, became, duchess, upon, her, father, s, death, in, 1137, later, that, year, she, married, louis, son, of, king, louis, vi, of, france, shortly, afterwards, eleanor, s, father, in, law, died, and, her, husband, became, king, making, her, queen, consort, louis, vii, and, eleanor, had, two, daughters, marie, and, alix, during, the, second, crusade, eleanor, accompanied, louis, to, the, holy, land, an, initial, request, in, 1149, for, an, annulment, of, the, marriage, on, grounds, of, consanguinity, was, rejected, by, pope, eugene, iii, in, 1152, after, fifteen, years, of, marriage, eleanor, had, not, borne, a, male, heir, and, the, annulment, was, granted, their, daughters, were, declared, legitimate, custody, was, awarded, to, louis, and, eleanor, s, lands, were, restored, to, her, in, the, same, year, eleanor, married, henry, duke, of, normandy, in, 1154, following, the, death, of, king, stephen, of, england, henry, and, eleanor, became, king, and, queen, of, england, the, couple, had, five, sons, and, three, daughters, but, eventually, became, estranged, henry, imprisoned, eleanor, for, supporting, the, 1173, revolt, against, him, by, their, sons, young, henry, richard, and, geoffrey, she, was, not, released, until, 1189, when, her, husband, died, and, their, third, son, richard, i, ascended, the, throne, as, queen, dowager, eleanor, acted, as, regent, during, richard, s, long, absences, from, england, and, france, on, richard, s, death, in, 1199, she, successfully, campaigned, for, his, younger, brother, john, to, succeed, him, after, continuing, turmoil, between, the, french, and, english, kings, and, the, successive, loss, of, the, lands, she, and, henry, ii, had, ruled, over, she, died, in, 1204, and, was, buried, in, fontevraud, abbey, in, france, eleanor, s, life, can, be, considered, as, consisting, of, five, distinct, phases, her, early, life, extending, to, adolescence, 1124, 1137, marriage, to, louis, vii, and, queen, of, france, 1137, 1152, marriage, to, henry, ii, and, queen, of, england, 1152, 1173, imprisonment, to, henry, s, death, 1173, 1189, and, as, a, widow, till, her, death, 1189, 1204, there, is, a, scarcity, of, primary, sources, on, eleanor, s, life, there, are, no, contemporary, biographies, and, modern, biographies, are, largely, drawn, from, annals, and, chronicles, generally, written, by, clerics, associated, with, the, royal, courts, there, are, very, few, surviving, records, from, aquitaine, and, she, is, barely, mentioned, in, records, of, the, french, court, and, appears, to, have, been, actively, erased, from, memory, consequently, accounts, of, eleanor, appear, largely, as, a, peripheral, figure, in, chronicles, of, the, men, around, her, important, secular, sources, from, england, and, wales, include, roger, of, howden, or, hoveden, d, c, 1203, walter, map, 1130, c, 1210, ralph, de, diceto, c, 1120, c, 1202, gerald, of, wales, giraldus, cambrensis, c, 1146, c, 1223, and, ralph, niger, c, 1140, c, 1217, while, some, were, relatively, neutral, map, and, gerald, were, largely, satirical, polemic, while, niger, s, criticisms, are, mainly, directed, at, henry, ii, rather, than, eleanor, among, the, chroniclers, are, also, clerical, sources, including, gervase, of, canterbury, c, 1141, c, 1210, ralph, of, coggeshall, d, c, 1227, richard, of, devizes, fl, late, 12th, century, william, of, newburgh, 1136, 1198, and, ranulf, higden, c, 1280, 1363, or, 1364, the, latter, were, mainly, influenced, by, their, revulsion, at, the, murder, of, thomas, becket, 1170, although, richard, of, devizes, admired, eleanor, s, perseverance, in, supporting, her, son, richard, all, of, them, expressed, negative, views, about, women, in, power, and, hinted, at, some, darker, attributes, that, eventually, led, to, a, black, legend, that, became, associated, with, her, later, twentieth, century, writers, such, as, amy, kelly, and, marion, meade, would, create, an, opposite, myth, that, pervaded, many, subsequent, accounts, of, a, feminist, herioine, referred, to, as, the, golden, myth, while, in, the, french, literature, similar, treatment, is, seen, in, the, work, of, r, gine, pernoud, more, recent, scholarship, has, sought, to, correct, both, of, these, types, of, characterisation, in, the, absence, of, reliable, contemporary, accounts, myth, legend, and, speculation, have, frequently, been, resorted, to, to, fill, the, gaps, rarely, in, the, course, of, historical, endeavor, has, so, much, been, written, over, so, many, centuries, about, one, woman, of, whom, we, know, so, little, eleanor, was, descended, on, her, father, s, side, from, a, long, dynastic, line, of, dukes, of, aquitaine, all, named, william, dating, back, to, the, 10th, century, who, in, turn, succeeded, the, carolingian, monarchs, of, the, kingdom, of, aquitaine, twelfth, century, aquitaine, was, a, relatively, vast, and, somewhat, ill, defined, area, of, modern, day, france, stretching, from, the, loire, in, the, north, to, the, pyrenees, in, the, south, and, from, the, atlantic, to, the, west, to, the, massif, central, to, the, east, it, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, vassal, states, within, france, at, that, time, in, contrast, the, french, kings, ruled, over, a, relatively, small, area, around, the, le, de, france, to, the, north, west, and, the, rulers, of, the, surrounding, duchies, duch, s, and, counties, comt, s, gave, only, nominal, allegiance, to, the, french, crown, while, little, is, known, of, eleanor, s, early, life, or, education, many, biographers, have, speculated, from, what, is, known, of, aristocratic, households, of, the, era, her, year, of, birth, is, not, known, precisely, and, the, first, mention, of, her, occurs, in, july, 1129, tradition, places, her, birth, on, one, of, her, parents, visit, to, bordeaux, likely, at, her, father, s, nearby, castle, at, belin, other, authors, suggest, poitiers, ombri, re, palace, bordeaux, or, nieul, sur, l, autise, while, the, date, of, her, birth, was, once, given, as, 1122, or, 1124, the, latter, is, now, generally, accepted, a, late, 13th, century, genealogy, of, her, family, listing, her, as, 13, years, old, at, her, father, s, death, in, the, spring, of, 1137, provides, the, best, evidence, that, eleanor, was, born, in, 1124, however, some, chronicles, mention, a, fidelity, oath, of, lords, of, aquitaine, on, the, occasion, of, eleanor, s, fourteenth, birthday, in, 1136, her, parents, are, unlikely, to, have, married, before, 1121, her, age, at, her, death, is, thus, stated, as, 80, or, 82, eleanor, or, ali, nor, was, the, oldest, of, three, children, born, to, william, x, duke, of, aquitaine, and, aenor, de, ch, tellerault, her, father, was, the, son, of, duke, william, ix, of, aquitaine, and, countess, philippa, of, toulouse, her, mother, was, the, daughter, of, aimery, i, viscount, of, ch, tellerault, and, dangereuse, de, l, isle, bouchard, dangereuse, was, also, william, ix, s, longtime, mistress, and, she, and, william, ix, then, arranged, for, their, respective, children, to, be, married, to, each, other, eleanor, had, two, siblings, a, lith, 1125, 1151, and, aigret, 1126, 1130, eleanor, was, named, for, her, mother, aenor, and, baptised, as, ali, nor, from, the, latin, alia, nor, which, means, the, other, aenor, it, became, el, anor, in, the, langues, d, o, l, of, northern, france, and, eleanor, in, english, but, the, exact, spelling, was, never, fixed, in, her, lifetime, little, if, anything, is, known, of, eleanor, s, education, eleanor, s, mother, died, in, 1130, when, she, was, only, six, and, her, younger, brother, also, died, in, that, year, the, only, contemporary, record, of, her, education, comes, from, bertran, de, born, the, troubadour, who, states, that, she, read, the, poetry, of, her, native, tongue, although, the, language, of, bordeaux, and, poitiers, was, poitevin, a, northern, french, langue, d, o, l, dialect, eleanor, was, soon, exposed, to, occitan, langue, d, oc, the, southern, dialect, and, language, of, the, poets, and, courtiers, at, the, ducal, court, with, the, death, of, her, brother, eleanor, became, the, heir, presumptive, to, her, father, s, domains, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, was, the, largest, and, richest, province, of, france, covering, an, area, corresponding, to, nineteen, departments, of, modern, france, and, about, a, third, of, what, was, then, considered, france, in, 1137, duke, william, x, left, poitiers, for, bordeaux, and, took, his, daughters, with, him, upon, reaching, bordeaux, he, left, them, at, l, ombri, re, castle, in, the, charge, of, geoffroi, du, louroux, archbishop, of, bordeaux, a, loyal, vassal, william, then, set, out, for, the, shrine, of, saint, james, of, compostela, in, the, company, of, other, pilgrims, however, he, died, on, good, friday, of, that, year, 9, april, eleanor, aged, 13, then, became, the, duchess, of, aquitaine, and, thus, one, of, the, richest, and, most, eligible, heiresses, in, europe, since, kidnapping, an, heiress, was, seen, as, a, viable, option, for, obtaining, a, title, and, lands, when, william, x, knew, that, he, was, dying, he, placed, eleanor, in, the, care, of, king, louis, vi, of, france, as, her, guardian, since, she, would, be, orphaned, william, requested, of, the, king, that, he, take, care, of, both, the, lands, and, the, duchess, and, find, her, a, suitable, husband, however, until, a, husband, was, found, the, king, had, the, legal, right, to, eleanor, s, lands, william, also, insisted, to, his, companions, that, his, death, be, kept, a, secret, until, louis, was, informed, the, men, were, to, journey, from, saint, james, of, compostela, across, the, pyrenees, as, quickly, as, possible, to, call, at, bordeaux, to, notify, the, archbishop, then, to, make, all, speed, to, paris, to, inform, the, king, the, king, of, france, known, as, louis, the, fat, who, was, in, poor, health, recognised, an, opportunity, to, realise, a, long, standing, ambition, to, enlarge, his, dominions, by, the, acquisition, of, aquitaine, his, eldest, surviving, son, louis, had, originally, been, destined, for, monastic, life, but, had, become, the, heir, apparent, when, the, king, s, eldest, son, philip, died, after, being, thrown, from, his, horse, in, 1131, the, death, of, duke, william, one, of, the, king, s, most, powerful, vassals, made, available, the, most, desirable, duchy, in, france, louis, who, had, long, sought, ways, of, increasing, the, relatively, small, part, of, france, under, his, direct, control, immediately, saw, the, opportunities, provided, by, his, guardianship, of, eleanor, he, realised, the, dangers, of, not, swiftly, settling, the, succession, of, the, aquitainian, duchy, while, a, marriage, between, his, son, and, heir, and, eleanor, would, add, the, considerable, resources, of, aquitaine, to, the, capetian, holdings, thus, he, spent, little, time, in, dispatching, the, young, louis, accompanied, by, a, large, retinue, some, 500, knights, along, with, abbot, suger, geoffrey, ii, bishop, of, chartres, theobald, ii, of, champagne, and, raoul, i, of, vermandois, to, bordeaux, to, secure, the, marriage, relatively, little, is, known, from, the, time, that, eleanor, was, queen, of, france, on, 25, july, 1137, eleanor, and, louis, were, married, in, the, cathedral, of, saint, andr, in, bordeaux, by, the, archbishop, of, bordeaux, immediately, after, the, wedding, the, couple, were, enthroned, as, duke, and, duchess, of, aquitaine, it, was, agreed, that, the, duchy, would, remain, independent, of, france, until, eleanor, s, oldest, son, became, both, king, of, france, and, duke, of, aquitaine, thus, her, holdings, would, not, be, merged, with, france, until, the, next, generation, as, a, wedding, present, she, gave, louis, a, rock, crystal, vase, from, bordeaux, the, couple, proceeded, to, poitiers, arriving, on, 1, august, where, after, a, week, of, festivities, they, were, invested, as, count, and, countess, of, poitou, on, 8, august, louis, s, tenure, as, count, of, poitou, and, duke, of, aquitaine, and, gascony, lasted, only, a, few, days, on, their, way, to, paris, a, messenger, arrived, with, the, news, that, louis, vi, had, died, on, 1, august, and, therefore, they, were, now, king, and, queen, of, france, louis, had, already, been, crowned, in, the, capetian, fashion, in, 1131, and, on, christmas, day, 1137, eleanor, was, crowned, queen, of, france, at, bourges, eleanor, was, not, popular, with, some, members, of, the, court, including, abbot, suger, and, louis, s, mother, adelaide, of, maurienne, who, left, the, court, shortly, thereafter, and, remarried, some, courtiers, made, unfavourable, reference, to, memories, of, another, southerner, constance, of, arles, from, provence, third, wife, of, robert, ii, and, ancestor, of, both, louis, vii, and, eleanor, queen, constance, had, had, a, reputation, for, being, indiscrete, in, both, dress, and, language, eleanor, s, conduct, was, repeatedly, criticised, by, church, elders, particularly, bernard, of, clairvaux, and, suger, as, indecorous, modifications, were, made, to, the, austere, cit, palace, in, paris, for, eleanor, s, sake, and, she, was, joined, by, her, sister, a, lith, in, paris, who, became, known, there, as, petronilla, the, county, of, toulouse, had, a, complicated, history, of, succession, eleanor, was, descended, from, the, counts, of, toulouse, through, her, grandmother, philippa, countess, of, toulouse, philippa, was, the, sole, child, of, william, iv, of, toulouse, but, following, his, death, in, 1093, it, was, his, brother, philippa, s, uncle, raymond, iv, r, 1094, 1105, who, asserted, a, right, to, the, title, philippa, then, persuaded, her, husband, william, ix, of, aquitaine, to, enforce, her, right, a, struggle, that, lasted, nearly, 30, years, finally, ending, in, 1123, with, raymond, iv, s, son, alfonso, jordan, r, 1112, 1148, during, this, time, control, of, toulouse, continually, changed, hands, between, william, ix, and, his, brother, s, descendants, philippa, s, claim, was, passed, on, to, eleanor, s, father, then, to, eleanor, herself, louis, vii, attempted, to, enforce, her, claim, by, marching, on, toulouse, arriving, at, the, walls, on, 21, june, 1141, although, he, laid, siege, to, the, city, he, was, unable, to, subjugate, it, and, withdrew, after, accepting, the, homage, of, count, alfonso, despite, this, setback, eleanor, continued, to, press, her, claims, with, further, expeditions, in, 1159, and, throughout, her, life, louis, soon, came, into, conflict, with, the, church, and, pope, innocent, ii, 1130, 1143, in, 1140, he, intervened, in, the, election, to, the, see, of, poitiers, on, finding, that, a, new, bishop, grimoald, had, been, elected, and, consecrated, without, his, consent, this, was, despite, the, fact, that, his, father, had, granted, the, ecclesiastical, province, of, bordeaux, the, right, to, do, so, and, that, he, himself, had, approved, this, louis, then, attempted, to, prohibit, grimoald, from, entering, the, city, thus, drawing, both, the, pope, and, bernard, of, clairvaux, into, the, dispute, the, pope, issued, an, order, to, overrule, the, royal, edict, but, grimoald, died, ending, the, dispute, the, ecclesiastical, authorities, were, aware, of, the, unsuccessful, attempt, of, both, eleanor, s, father, and, grandfather, to, interfere, in, church, matters, however, the, poitiers, affair, was, soon, followed, by, other, attempts, by, louis, to, exert, his, authority, the, most, consequential, of, these, occurred, when, the, archbishopric, of, bourges, became, vacant, in, 1141, louis, put, forward, as, a, candidate, his, chancellor, cadurc, while, vetoing, the, one, suitable, candidate, pierre, de, la, chatre, a, monk, who, was, promptly, elected, by, the, canons, of, bourges, and, consecrated, by, the, pope, in, rome, louis, accordingly, bolted, the, gates, of, bourges, against, the, new, archbishop, on, his, return, the, pope, recalling, similar, attempts, by, william, x, to, exile, supporters, of, innocent, from, poitou, and, replace, them, with, priests, loyal, to, himself, may, have, blamed, eleanor, for, this, but, stated, that, louis, was, only, a, foolish, schoolboy, and, should, be, taught, not, to, meddle, in, such, matters, outraged, louis, swore, upon, relics, that, so, long, as, he, lived, pierre, should, never, enter, bourges, an, interdict, was, thereupon, imposed, upon, the, royal, household, and, lands, and, pierre, was, given, refuge, by, theobald, ii, count, of, champagne, further, annoying, the, king, louis, had, been, in, a, situation, of, increasing, conflict, with, theobald, ii, and, the, bourges, affair, together, with, a, crisis, in, theobald, s, family, brought, this, to, a, head, in, 1125, theobald, s, younger, sister, eleanor, had, married, raoul, i, count, of, vermandois, and, seneschal, of, france, but, count, raoul, had, been, forming, a, liaison, with, petronilla, the, queen, s, sister, raoul, eventually, deserted, his, wife, seeking, an, annulment, of, their, marriage, on, grounds, of, consanguinity, to, which, louis, acquiesced, finding, three, bishops, who, agreed, that, the, marriage, was, invalid, and, then, in, 1142, officiated, at, the, wedding, of, petronilla, and, raoul, both, theobald, who, had, taken, his, sister, under, protection, and, bernard, of, clairvaux, protested, to, the, pope, who, convened, a, council, voided, both, the, annulment, from, countess, eleanor, and, marriage, to, petronilla, excommunicated, one, bishop, and, suspended, the, other, two, furthermore, raoul, was, ordered, to, return, to, his, wife, upon, his, refusal, he, and, petronilla, were, excommunicated, and, their, lands, placed, under, interdiction, eleanor, s, assumed, role, in, these, affairs, led, to, the, first, appearance, of, the, black, legend, that, would, be, associated, with, her, for, centuries, women, even, queens, were, not, expected, to, concern, themselves, with, such, matters, and, that, therefore, she, might, represent, darker, powers, rumours, began, to, associate, her, with, mythical, figures, such, as, melusine, things, took, a, more, salacious, turn, when, it, was, suggested, she, was, having, an, affair, with, geoffrey, plantagenet, count, of, anjou, louis, rejected, the, papal, legate, s, decision, and, ordered, an, invasion, of, champagne, in, a, war, that, would, last, two, years, 1142, 44, and, ended, with, the, occupation, of, champagne, by, the, royal, army, for, a, year, the, royal, army, laid, waste, to, the, champagne, countryside, but, since, theobald, showed, no, signs, of, backing, down, louis, took, personal, charge, of, the, assault, in, 1143, which, focused, on, the, siege, of, the, town, of, vitry, more, than, a, thousand, people, sought, refuge, in, the, cathedral, which, caught, fire, burning, alive, everyone, inside, horrified, at, the, carnage, louis, returned, to, paris, seeking, to, make, peace, with, theobald, in, return, and, with, the, support, of, the, pope, he, demanded, raoul, renounce, petronilla, and, the, interdiction, on, raoul, and, petronilla, was, duly, lifted, while, louis, ordered, a, retreat, when, raoul, refused, the, king, s, demands, the, royal, forces, once, more, invaded, champagne, public, opinion, was, turning, against, the, war, and, in, particular, bernard, of, clairvaux, was, very, critical, while, suger, advised, settling, the, issues, innocent, ii, died, in, september, 1143, and, was, succeeded, by, celestine, ii, 1143, 1144, who, once, more, lifted, the, interdiction, in, an, offer, of, conciliation, at, bernard, s, suggestion, and, louis, became, more, open, to, negotiation, it, was, about, this, time, that, questions, of, consanguinity, were, first, raised, about, louis, and, eleanor, s, marriage, since, he, had, opposed, a, number, of, other, marriages, on, these, grounds, including, that, of, raoul, and, eleanor, of, champagne, consequently, a, number, of, negotiations, took, place, over, the, winter, of, 1143, 1144, finally, suger, hosted, a, meeting, at, his, newly, built, monastic, church, at, saint, denis, during, a, feast, day, on, 22, april, 1144, at, which, bernard, persuaded, eleanor, that, her, efforts, on, behalf, of, her, sister, were, hopeless, and, peace, was, restored, although, the, couple, continued, to, refuse, to, separate, and, they, remained, excommunicated, till, 1148, when, raoul, s, first, marriage, was, once, again, invalidated, and, his, second, marriage, validated, also, the, saint, denis, agreement, included, louis, withdrawing, his, opposition, to, the, archbishop, of, bourges, the, discussion, between, eleanor, and, bernard, also, included, reference, to, her, apparent, infertility, she, had, had, one, miscarriage, in, 1138, and, a, suggestion, that, she, might, be, rewarded, for, her, concessions, with, a, child, in, april, 1145, eleanor, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, marie, on, sunday, 11, june, 1144, the, king, and, queen, attended, the, dedication, of, saint, denis, at, which, time, louis, donated, eleanor, s, crystal, vase, louis, remained, obsessed, over, the, massacre, at, vitry, and, considered, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, but, events, overtook, this, desire, the, first, crusade, 1096, 1099, had, succeeded, in, capturing, the, holy, land, from, the, turks, and, establishing, a, system, of, four, largely, frankish, crusader, states, to, administer, the, region, known, as, the, outremer, but, this, was, threatened, when, on, 24, december, 1144, zengi, and, the, saracen, turks, captured, edessa, capital, of, one, of, the, frankish, states, making, the, adjacent, states, of, antioch, tripoli, and, jerusalem, vulnerable, of, these, antioch, was, the, most, vulnerable, and, of, particular, concern, since, the, prince, of, antioch, was, raymond, of, poitiers, eleanor, s, uncle, in, the, autumn, of, 1145, louis, had, received, emissaries, from, the, outremer, and, appeals, were, also, sent, to, pope, eugene, iii, 1145, 1153, on, 1, december, the, pope, issued, a, bull, requesting, that, louis, and, all, faithful, christians, of, france, mount, a, crusade, to, rescue, the, remaining, states, in, exchange, they, would, receive, a, remission, of, their, sins, louis, and, eleanor, were, at, bourges, when, the, message, arrived, and, louis, responded, enthusiastically, on, christmas, day, that, he, would, lead, a, crusade, noting, a, lack, of, enthusiasm, among, the, french, nobility, louis, postponed, further, action, till, easter, 1146, having, recruited, bernard, of, clairveaux, to, deliver, a, message, supporting, his, crusade, at, v, zelay, on, 31, march, queen, eleanor, also, formally, took, the, cross, during, bernard, s, sermon, which, meant, leaving, her, daughter, behind, eleanor, recruited, some, women, of, the, aquitainian, nobility, for, the, campaign, as, well, as, some, 300, other, women, who, volunteered, to, help, it, was, not, unusual, for, women, to, take, part, in, crusades, from, louis, s, perspective, there, were, advantages, in, including, her, as, regent, to, an, absent, monarch, she, could, have, created, problems, for, suger, louis, s, choice, as, his, administrator, and, he, needed, the, support, of, the, aquitainian, nobility, furthermore, the, crusade, was, ostensibly, to, come, to, the, aid, of, her, uncle, the, presence, of, women, was, not, without, its, critics, particularly, among, clerics, though, this, may, have, been, influenced, by, hindsight, given, that, william, of, newburgh, s, account, was, written, well, after, the, actual, crusade, in, february, 1147, the, planning, process, of, the, crusade, was, initiated, at, tampes, where, it, was, learned, that, conrad, iii, of, germany, would, be, joining, their, venture, and, requests, for, safe, passages, through, adjacent, lands, were, sent, final, planning, took, place, at, saint, denis, over, easter, that, year, on, 20, april, at, which, pope, eugene, attended, louis, delegated, administration, of, his, kingdom, to, eugene, who, appointed, suger, regent, with, ralph, of, vermandois, as, co, regent, eleanor, s, taking, the, cross, provided, the, next, opportunity, for, her, detractors, to, construct, her, legend, with, claims, that, she, and, her, ladies, set, off, for, the, crusades, as, amazonian, warriors, on, 11, june, some, 25, 000, to, 50, 000, crusaders, and, pilgrims, gathered, at, saint, denis, and, began, their, march, first, to, metz, and, then, crossing, the, rhine, at, worms, and, pressing, on, to, regensburg, and, the, danube, river, there, they, were, met, by, envoys, from, manuel, komnenos, r, 1143, 1180, the, byzantine, emperor, and, followed, the, river, via, klosterneuburg, and, through, hungary, reaching, belgrade, and, the, eastern, empire, by, mid, august, and, then, crossing, the, danube, to, adrianople, and, finally, constantinople, five, days, later, on, 4, october, 1147, in, constantinople, the, french, crusaders, were, obliged, to, pause, and, await, the, arrival, of, those, of, their, forces, that, were, travelling, by, sea, while, there, they, received, the, hospitality, of, the, emperor, louis, and, eleanor, staying, in, the, philopation, palace, just, outside, the, city, walls, meanwhile, the, german, crusaders, had, gone, ahead, and, crossed, the, bosphorus, into, asia, minor, once, all, their, forces, were, gathered, together, the, french, crossed, into, asia, on, 15, october, and, proceeded, south, to, their, first, stop, at, nicaea, continuing, south, down, the, aegean, coast, they, discovered, that, the, germans, who, had, proceeded, directly, inland, had, suffered, a, major, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, turks, at, the, battle, of, dorylaeum, and, that, the, emperor, had, been, wounded, the, french, together, with, the, remnants, of, the, germans, continued, south, on, the, safer, coastal, route, to, ephesus, via, pergamus, and, smyrna, which, they, reached, on, 20, december, after, camping, at, ephesus, conrad, and, most, of, the, germans, left, them, returning, to, constantinople, by, sea, in, january, 1148, louis, decided, to, travel, inland, towards, laodicea, in, phrygia, in, order, to, reach, antalya, on, the, south, coast, and, thus, antioch, more, quickly, they, reached, laodicea, on, 6, january, and, then, their, route, took, them, across, the, mountains, on, the, day, of, their, crossing, of, mount, cadmus, louis, took, charge, of, the, rear, of, the, column, where, the, unarmed, pilgrims, and, the, baggage, trains, were, while, the, vanguard, was, commanded, by, the, aquitainian, geoffrey, de, rancon, and, instructed, to, set, camp, on, the, plateau, before, the, next, pass, they, reached, the, summit, of, cadmus, one, of, the, highest, in, their, path, but, rancon, in, concert, with, louis, s, uncle, amadeus, iii, count, of, savoy, and, maurienne, chose, to, continue, on, through, the, pass, to, the, next, valley, judging, it, a, better, campsite, accordingly, when, the, main, part, of, the, column, arrived, and, approached, the, pass, separated, from, both, the, vanguard, and, rearguard, they, were, attacked, by, the, turkish, forces, lying, in, wait, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, mount, cadmus, the, turks, inflicted, great, losses, on, the, french, while, louis, himself, barely, escaped, odo, of, deuil, describes, how, he, nimbly, and, bravely, scaled, a, rock, by, making, use, of, some, tree, roots, which, god, had, provided, for, his, safety, others, were, not, so, fortunate, no, aid, came, from, heaven, except, that, night, fell, the, chronicler, william, of, tyre, writing, between, 1170, and, 1184, and, thus, perhaps, too, long, after, the, event, to, be, considered, historically, accurate, placed, the, blame, for, this, disaster, firmly, on, the, amount, of, baggage, being, carried, much, of, it, reputedly, belonging, to, eleanor, and, her, ladies, and, the, presence, of, non, combatants, louis, was, a, weak, and, ineffectual, military, leader, with, no, skill, for, maintaining, troop, discipline, or, morale, or, of, making, informed, and, logical, tactical, decisions, official, blame, for, the, disaster, was, placed, on, geoffrey, de, rancon, who, had, made, the, decision, to, continue, and, it, was, suggested, that, he, be, hanged, a, suggestion, which, the, king, ignored, since, geoffrey, was, eleanor, s, vassal, many, believed, that, it, was, she, who, had, been, ultimately, responsible, for, the, change, in, plan, and, thus, the, massacre, this, suspicion, of, responsibility, did, nothing, for, her, popularity, in, christendom, she, was, also, blamed, for, the, size, of, the, baggage, train, and, the, fact, that, her, aquitanian, soldiers, had, marched, at, the, front, and, thus, were, not, involved, in, the, fight, eventually, the, survivors, reached, antalya, on, 20, january, in, antalya, the, crusaders, found, there, was, a, limited, number, of, ships, available, and, those, that, were, required, more, money, than, they, were, willing, to, pay, consequently, the, royal, party, sailed, from, the, port, with, a, relatively, small, group, of, followers, arriving, in, antioch, on, 19, march, well, behind, schedule, the, remainder, attempted, to, complete, the, journey, with, great, hardship, and, much, loss, only, about, half, of, them, completing, the, journey, while, the, crusaders, were, initially, welcomed, tensions, grew, between, them, and, raymond, raymond, s, agenda, was, to, attack, aleppo, and, regain, control, of, edessa, and, hence, gain, some, security, while, louis, was, determined, to, press, on, to, jerusalem, despite, the, original, papal, decree, being, to, recapture, edessa, louis, was, not, keen, to, fight, in, northern, syria, and, his, forces, were, badly, depleted, furthermore, he, had, a, personal, agenda, to, journey, in, pilgrimage, to, jerusalem, eleanor, s, loyalty, to, her, uncle, created, conflict, between, louis, and, eleanor, eventually, the, french, now, only, a, tenth, of, their, original, strength, left, antioch, abruptly, on, 28, march, despite, eleanor, s, protests, and, attempts, to, remain, with, raymond, these, conflicts, once, again, led, to, the, question, of, consanguinity, being, raised, according, to, john, of, salisbury, it, was, eleanor, who, prompted, this, the, crusaders, reached, jerusalem, in, may, entering, by, the, jaffa, gate, where, they, were, greeted, by, queen, melisende, and, king, baldwin, iii, a, conference, was, then, held, at, acre, on, 24, june, to, discuss, strategic, plans, this, resulted, in, the, disastrous, siege, of, damascus, on, 24, july, the, crusaders, forced, withdrawal, after, only, four, days, effectively, ended, the, crusade, and, many, of, the, survivors, started, making, plans, to, return, but, louis, vowed, to, celebrate, easter, 1149, in, the, holy, land, despite, the, pleas, of, suger, the, sojourn, in, antioch, and, the, conflict, between, the, rulers, and, the, resulting, rift, between, the, royal, couple, led, to, chroniclers, such, as, john, of, salisbury, and, william, of, tyre, hinting, at, an, adulterous, and, incestuous, affair, between, eleanor, and, raymond, that, would, become, an, enduring, part, of, her, legend, which, in, some, versions, also, depicted, her, as, having, an, affair, with, a, saracen, leader, contemporary, accounts, suggest, it, was, her, attention, to, political, affairs, that, was, considered, the, greatest, stain, on, her, character, after, celebrating, easter, louis, and, eleanor, set, sail, from, acre, for, italy, in, separate, ships, on, 3, april, but, were, delayed, by, both, hostile, naval, forces, off, the, peloponnesus, in, may, and, storms, which, drove, eleanor, s, ship, as, far, south, as, the, barbary, coast, and, for, a, while, their, whereabouts, were, unknown, louis, arrived, in, calabria, on, 29, july, and, eventually, discovered, eleanor, had, reached, palermo, sicily, where, she, was, sheltered, by, agents, of, king, roger, ii, at, his, palace, it, took, some, time, before, eleanor, and, louis, could, be, reunited, at, king, roger, s, court, in, potenza, eleanor, had, learned, of, the, death, of, her, uncle, raymond, who, had, been, beheaded, by, nureddin, s, nur, ad, din, muslim, forces, at, the, battle, of, inab, on, 29, june, nureddin, then, overran, most, of, raymond, s, territories, in, antioch, setting, back, the, goals, of, the, crusade, even, further, instead, of, returning, directly, to, france, louis, and, eleanor, headed, north, towards, rome, and, the, pope, stopping, at, the, abbey, of, monte, cassino, on, 4, october, after, eleanor, fell, ill, pope, eugenius, invited, them, to, stay, at, his, palace, at, tusculum, south, of, rome, where, they, arrived, on, 9, october, eugenius, had, been, informed, by, suger, of, the, couple, s, marital, problems, and, that, they, were, no, longer, having, sexual, relations, the, question, of, consanguinity, and, hence, possible, annulment, was, again, raised, but, was, denied, by, eugenius, who, declared, the, marriage, legitimate, by, canon, law, and, urged, reconciliation, it, is, likely, that, eleanor, s, second, child, was, conceived, at, this, time, from, tusculum, the, couple, travelled, north, through, italy, visiting, rome, and, then, crossing, the, alps, to, reach, france, and, finally, arriving, in, paris, around, 11, november, 1149, after, an, absence, of, two, and, a, half, years, in, the, summer, of, 1150, eleanor, gave, birth, to, a, second, daughter, alix, adelicia, the, lack, of, a, male, heir, was, unprecedented, in, the, capetian, line, eleanor, was, now, twenty, six, and, had, been, married, for, thirteen, years, not, only, was, the, likelihood, of, a, son, being, born, to, secure, the, succession, seen, as, remote, but, the, lack, of, an, heir, was, perceived, as, an, omen, suger, had, been, a, strong, advocate, for, the, political, advantages, of, the, marriage, between, louis, and, eleanor, when, he, died, on, 13, january, 1151, the, balance, changed, since, bernard, of, clairvaux, was, a, critic, of, the, marriage, s, consanguinity, a, number, of, nobles, and, courtiers, also, advised, the, king, to, dissolve, the, marriage, later, that, year, henry, count, of, anjou, appeared, at, the, court, in, paris, to, pay, homage, as, the, new, duke, of, normandy, to, king, louis, chroniclers, such, as, giraldus, cambrensis, gerald, of, wales, william, of, newburgh, and, walter, map, later, implied, that, something, happened, between, henry, and, eleanor, eleven, years, his, senior, that, contributed, to, the, dissolution, of, her, marriage, with, louis, by, this, stage, her, reputation, badly, damaged, eleanor, s, influence, at, court, was, waning, any, such, dissolution, would, require, a, complex, political, realignment, separating, the, aquitanian, and, capetian, possessions, and, jurisdictions, and, in, the, autumn, of, 1151, the, couple, made, a, tour, of, the, duchy, during, which, much, of, the, french, presence, such, as, garrisons, was, replaced, with, eleanor, s, people, on, 11, march, 1152, at, the, royal, castle, of, beaugency, on, the, loire, near, orl, ans, hugues, de, toucy, archbishop, of, sens, and, primate, of, france, presided, over, a, synod, to, consider, the, matter, louis, and, eleanor, were, both, present, as, were, the, archbishops, of, reims, bordeaux, and, rouen, and, many, other, bishops, and, nobility, archbishop, samson, of, reims, acted, for, eleanor, who, did, not, contest, the, action, on, 21, march, the, four, archbishops, with, the, approval, of, pope, eugenius, granted, an, annulment, on, grounds, of, consanguinity, within, the, fourth, degree, eleanor, was, louis, s, third, cousin, once, removed, and, shared, common, ancestry, with, robert, ii, of, france, and, his, wife, constance, of, arles, their, two, daughters, were, however, declared, legitimate, children, born, to, a, marriage, that, was, later, annulled, were, not, at, risk, of, being, bastardised, because, here, the, parties, married, in, good, faith, without, knowledge, of, an, impediment, the, canonists, held, that, the, children, of, the, marriage, were, legitimate, and, that, the, marriage, itself, was, valid, up, to, the, day, it, was, declared, null, custody, of, their, daughters, was, awarded, to, king, louis, as, both, custom, and, law, decreed, louis, assured, archbishop, samson, that, eleanor, s, lands, would, be, restored, to, her, while, eleanor, stated, that, the, reason, for, the, annulment, was, for, reasons, of, kinship, with, my, lord, louis, the, event, fueled, speculation, as, to, her, behaviour, and, added, to, the, growing, legend, equally, without, evidence, are, accounts, of, a, distraught, discarded, wife, once, again, a, single, woman, with, possessions, eleanor, was, at, risk, of, abduction, and, forced, marriage, to, acquire, her, domains, from, beaugency, she, travelled, south, towards, her, court, in, poitiers, on, her, route, she, narrowly, evaded, two, attempts, to, kidnap, her, the, first, was, by, theobald, v, count, of, blois, and, chartres, on, the, night, of, 21, march, as, she, passed, through, his, lands, at, blois, but, she, escaped, by, taking, a, boat, down, the, loire, to, tours, then, geoffrey, of, anjou, lay, in, wait, for, her, at, port, de, piles, on, the, border, of, touraine, and, poitou, but, warned, at, tours, of, the, plot, she, changed, her, route, avoiding, the, usual, crossing, of, the, creuse, river, she, continued, downstream, to, its, confluence, with, the, vienne, river, avoiding, main, roads, and, arriving, safely, by, boat, at, poitiers, this, rapuit, et, abduxit, was, a, common, practice, regarding, heiresses, even, in, her, own, family, as, soon, as, she, arrived, in, poitiers, just, before, easter, eleanor, sent, envoys, to, geoffrey, of, anjou, s, older, brother, henry, duke, of, normandy, asking, him, to, come, at, once, to, marry, her, many, authors, conclude, that, this, fulfilled, a, prior, arrangement, made, at, his, earlier, visit, to, the, french, court, while, providing, security, for, her, aquitaine, lands, the, choice, of, henry, also, made, political, sense, as, anjou, lay, on, the, northern, border, of, aquitaine, thus, protecting, it, and, enlarging, her, joint, jurisdiction, she, then, set, about, revoking, all, acts, and, charters, of, louis, relating, to, aquitaine, and, replacing, them, with, her, own, the, message, reached, henry, at, lisieux, on, 6, april, henry, arrived, in, poitiers, in, mid, may, and, on, 18, may, 1152, whit, sunday, eight, weeks, after, her, annulment, eleanor, married, the, much, younger, henry, in, a, quiet, private, ceremony, at, poitiers, cathedral, thereby, transferring, her, aquitaine, lands, from, louis, to, henry, the, ceremony, was, described, as, being, without, the, pomp, and, ceremony, that, befitted, their, rank, they, had, kept, the, arrangements, secret, for, fear, that, louis, who, regarded, the, growing, power, of, henry, and, the, angevins, with, anxiety, would, prevent, it, eleanor, was, related, to, henry, even, more, closely, than, she, had, been, to, louis, they, were, cousins, to, the, third, degree, through, their, common, ancestor, ermengarde, of, anjou, wife, of, robert, i, duke, of, burgundy, and, geoffrey, count, of, g, tinais, and, they, were, also, descended, from, king, robert, ii, of, france, her, remarriage, to, henry, provided, the, next, chapter, of, the, legend, of, her, scandalous, behaviour, it, being, implied, that, she, had, a, previous, illicit, relationship, with, him, when, louis, discovered, eleanor, had, married, his, archrival, and, knowing, henry, was, also, in, line, for, succession, to, the, throne, of, england, he, was, furious, and, immediately, made, preparations, for, war, he, also, refused, to, give, up, the, title, of, duke, of, aquitaine, that, he, had, acquired, through, marriage, to, eleanor, and, was, now, henry, s, by, the, same, right, for, if, eleanor, bore, a, male, heir, his, daughters, would, be, disinherited, his, subsequent, invasion, of, normandy, marked, the, beginning, of, an, angevin, capetian, conflict, that, would, last, more, than, fifty, years, now, as, duchess, of, both, aquitaine, and, normandy, eleanor, exercised, independent, power, in, her, court, and, within, her, hereditary, domains, striking, new, seals, for, her, charters, both, as, duchess, of, aquitaine, and, countess, of, poitou, but, also, with, the, added, titles, of, duchess, of, the, normans, and, countess, of, the, angevins, within, a, month, henry, departed, with, the, intention, of, pursuing, his, claim, to, the, throne, of, england, but, now, had, to, deal, with, louis, s, invasion, of, normandy, which, he, easily, repelled, within, six, weeks, signing, a, truce, so, that, by, the, autumn, of, that, year, he, was, able, to, return, to, aquitaine, to, commemorate, their, marriage, henry, and, eleanor, had, a, stained, glass, window, installed, at, poitiers, cathedral, in, which, they, are, represented, kneeling, as, donors, by, late, 1152, the, couple, moved, to, rouen, in, normandy, and, in, january, 1153, henry, finally, set, sail, for, england, to, challenge, king, stephen, s, claim, to, the, throne, he, did, not, return, till, march, 1154, leaving, the, now, pregnant, eleanor, with, his, mother, the, empress, matilda, and, his, youngest, brother, william, on, 17, august, 1153, henry, and, eleanor, s, first, child, william, was, born, most, likely, at, angers, in, england, henry, had, finally, fought, stephen, to, a, truce, and, at, the, treaty, of, winchester, in, november, 1153, it, was, agreed, that, henry, would, be, stephen, s, heir, and, successor, and, this, was, ratified, at, westminster, at, christmas, upon, henry, s, return, to, his, french, domains, eleanor, again, became, pregnant, meanwhile, louis, vii, remarried, became, reconciled, with, henry, and, relinquished, the, title, of, duke, of, aquitaine, on, 25, october, 1154, king, stephen, died, although, henry, was, immediately, summoned, to, england, it, was, not, until, 7, december, that, he, and, eleanor, were, able, to, cross, the, channel, from, barfleur, landing, near, southampton, on, the, 8th, they, travelled, first, to, winchester, to, greet, archbishop, theobald, of, canterbury, who, had, been, acting, as, regent, from, winchester, the, royal, party, moved, to, london, and, were, lodged, at, the, royal, palace, at, bermondsey, on, 19, december, 1154, archbishop, theobald, crowned, henry, as, king, henry, ii, in, westminster, abbey, with, eleanor, beside, him, it, is, unclear, whether, eleanor, was, actually, crowned, or, anointed, as, well, since, she, had, already, been, crowned, queen, of, france, in, 1137, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, house, of, plantagenet, that, would, rule, england, till, the, end, of, the, fifteenth, century, as, queen, of, england, eleanor, was, provided, for, generously, by, henry, including, multiple, dowerlands, and, regular, settlements, of, money, that, made, her, one, of, the, richest, people, in, the, kingdom, earning, her, the, title, of, riche, dame, de, riche, rei, relatively, little, is, known, about, eleanor, during, the, reign, of, henry, ii, in, that, the, chroniclers, barely, mention, her, other, than, to, note, when, she, was, with, the, king, and, biographies, have, been, built, on, these, itineraries, and, surviving, official, documents, including, letters, writs, and, charters, she, signed, her, official, documents, latin, alienor, dei, gracia, regine, anglorum, lit, eleanor, by, the, grace, of, god, queen, of, england, this, was, not, uncommon, in, that, the, activities, of, women, were, not, thought, to, be, of, sufficient, importance, to, report, they, were, merely, latin, regalis, imperrii, participes, lit, participants, in, the, imperial, kingship, furthermore, the, independence, and, authority, of, queens, had, been, progressively, eroded, prior, to, her, ascension, to, the, role, she, would, however, participate, with, the, king, in, ceremonial, occasions, such, as, the, easter, or, christmas, courts, though, she, never, learned, english, henry, s, dominions, stretched, from, the, scottish, border, to, the, pyrenees, and, he, was, frequently, travelling, through, them, both, in, england, and, france, and, was, absent, from, england, far, more, than, any, of, his, predecessors, for, much, of, his, absences, from, court, eleanor, acted, as, either, regent, or, co, regent, with, the, justiciar, although, she, sometimes, accompanied, king, henry, she, also, travelled, extensively, throughout, her, domains, on, her, own, or, with, her, children, while, claims, that, she, was, an, influential, patron, of, the, arts, appear, to, be, greatly, exaggerated, many, writers, dedicated, works, to, her, for, a, variety, of, reasons, chiefly, their, own, advancement, these, include, robert, wace, s, roman, de, brut, c, 1155, and, william, of, blois, while, other, writers, such, as, marie, de, france, and, the, author, of, roman, de, thebes, are, believed, to, have, been, inspired, by, her, some, writers, such, as, marie, de, france, appear, to, associate, her, with, the, athurian, legends, while, the, more, speculative, eleanor, legends, even, associate, her, with, the, person, of, guinevere, on, 28, february, 1155, eleanor, gave, birth, to, the, couple, s, second, child, henry, during, the, king, s, absence, on, 10, january, 1156, king, henry, left, england, for, one, of, his, many, prolonged, absences, leaving, eleanor, pregnant, again, it, was, during, this, absence, in, the, spring, of, 1156, that, prince, william, died, and, was, buried, at, reading, abbey, next, to, his, great, grandfather, henry, i, shortly, after, in, june, of, that, year, the, couple, s, third, child, matilda, was, born, and, eleanor, and, her, children, travelled, to, france, to, be, with, henry, in, july, returning, in, february, 1157, henry, joined, her, in, england, in, april, and, on, 8, september, their, fourth, child, richard, was, born, at, beaumont, palace, after, 1156, eleanor, s, autonomous, rule, of, her, duchy, was, much, diminished, her, name, disappearing, other, than, to, confirm, acts, of, henry, for, whom, aquitainians, had, little, respect, meanwhile, louis, vii, had, remarried, in, 1154, and, by, 1157, had, a, third, daughter, marguerite, noting, a, seeming, inability, of, louis, to, produce, a, male, heir, henry, ii, conceived, of, a, plan, to, eventually, acquire, the, french, throne, by, marrying, his, son, henry, to, marguerite, and, began, making, plans, in, 1158, and, travelling, to, france, in, august, to, negotiate, the, terms, with, louis, and, take, the, infant, marguerite, into, his, care, until, she, was, old, enough, to, marry, he, would, remain, away, for, over, four, years, while, henry, was, away, eleanor, gave, birth, to, a, fourth, son, geoffrey, on, 23, september, 1158, and, shortly, after, rejoined, henry, in, france, in, 1159, henry, accompanied, by, eleanor, made, a, further, unsuccessful, attempt, at, enforcing, her, claims, to, toulouse, through, her, grandmother, thereby, alienating, louis, vii, again, since, raymond, v, count, of, toulouse, was, both, his, vassal, and, now, his, relative, although, henry, had, formed, a, coalition, to, conquer, toulouse, louis, came, to, raymond, s, aid, amongst, henry, s, allies, was, raymond, berengar, iv, prince, of, aragon, and, count, of, barcelona, he, symbolically, tied, the, two, dynasties, by, betrothing, his, son, richard, to, raymond, berengar, s, daughter, but, by, september, henry, had, been, forced, to, a, temporary, truce, although, this, was, the, beginning, of, forty, years, of, war, between, england, and, france, eleanor, sailed, to, england, on, 29, december, obtained, funds, for, henry, s, campaigns, and, escorted, it, to, him, in, france, before, returning, to, england, it, was, not, till, september, 1160, that, henry, again, summoned, eleanor, and, the, children, to, be, with, him, in, france, louis, vii, s, second, wife, had, died, that, year, providing, him, with, only, two, daughters, but, no, male, heir, and, he, promptly, arranged, a, third, marriage, therefore, henry, ii, decided, to, immediately, arrange, for, prince, henry, s, marriage, to, marguerite, despite, their, being, only, children, for, this, he, obtained, a, special, dispensation, from, the, church, and, the, marriage, proceeded, on, 2, november, unbeknown, to, louis, eleanor, remained, in, france, and, in, september, 1161, gave, birth, to, their, second, daughter, eleanor, at, domfront, normandy, the, number, of, years, between, the, birth, of, geoffrey, 1158, and, eleanor, 1161, compared, to, queen, eleanor, s, other, pregnancies, has, given, rise, to, speculation, about, the, presence, of, another, child, john, speed, in, his, history, of, great, britain, 1611, states, that, eleanor, had, a, son, named, philip, born, sometime, between, 1158, and, 1162, and, died, young, his, sources, no, longer, exist, and, he, alone, mentions, this, birth, henry, and, eleanor, finally, returned, to, england, on, 25, january, 1163, after, their, prolonged, absence, which, also, marked, the, end, of, her, duties, as, regent, in, england, february, 1165, saw, henry, back, on, the, continent, to, arrange, the, marriages, of, their, daughters, matilda, and, eleanor, to, cement, an, alliance, with, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, and, eleanor, joined, him, on, 1, may, acting, as, his, regent, in, anjou, and, maine, it, was, there, that, another, daughter, joan, was, born, at, angers, in, october, although, henry, was, not, there, having, returned, to, england, only, two, weeks, after, her, arrival, during, much, of, these, times, the, royal, couple, saw, very, little, of, each, other, henry, not, joining, her, till, she, asked, for, his, help, in, dealing, with, a, potential, revolt, in, march, 1166, his, conflict, with, the, breton, nobles, being, settled, by, betrothing, prince, geoffrey, to, constance, daughter, of, conan, iv, duke, of, brittany, these, long, periods, of, separation, would, give, rise, to, speculation, and, then, rumours, of, henry, s, infidelities, and, a, resultant, rift, between, him, and, eleanor, the, most, notorious, of, these, stories, was, that, of, an, alleged, affair, starting, some, time, in, 1165, with, rosamund, clifford, by, late, 1166, henry, s, affair, had, become, known, and, was, acknowledged, by, 1174, henry, was, by, no, means, faithful, to, his, wife, and, had, a, reputation, for, philandering, he, fathered, other, illegitimate, children, throughout, the, marriage, eleanor, appears, to, have, taken, an, ambivalent, attitude, towards, these, affairs, geoffrey, of, york, for, example, was, an, illegitimate, son, of, henry, but, acknowledged, by, henry, as, his, child, and, raised, at, westminster, in, the, care, of, the, queen, following, the, birth, of, joanna, eleanor, remained, at, angers, henry, did, not, join, her, for, christmas, that, year, only, crossing, to, france, in, march, 1166, where, he, would, remain, for, another, four, years, the, unprecedented, separation, at, christmas, also, led, to, speculation, of, discord, but, henry, was, with, her, by, easter, that, year, when, she, conceived, their, last, child, john, after, easter, eleanor, returned, to, england, and, christmas, 1166, was, again, spent, apart, with, john, having, been, born, on, christmas, eve, eleanor, now, 42, years, old, did, not, join, henry, in, france, till, they, spent, christmas, 1167, together, at, angers, this, year, also, saw, her, bringing, matilda, then, only, eleven, to, the, continent, in, september, in, preparation, for, her, marriage, to, the, much, older, henry, the, lion, duke, of, saxony, which, took, place, on, 1, february, 1168, henry, ii, s, reign, was, marred, by, a, bitter, feud, with, thomas, becket, which, began, in, 1163, becket, was, initially, a, close, friend, and, adviser, then, his, chancellor, and, eventually, archbishop, of, canterbury, there, has, been, some, speculation, as, to, what, role, eleanor, may, have, played, in, this, but, very, little, evidence, during, his, exile, in, france, from, 1164, becket, unsuccessfully, sought, her, help, what, little, evidence, exists, though, suggests, that, she, urged, reconciliation, in, december, 1167, eleanor, gathered, her, movable, possessions, in, england, and, transported, them, on, several, ships, to, argentan, christmas, was, celebrated, at, the, royal, court, there, and, immediately, afterward, she, left, for, her, own, city, of, poitiers, henry, and, his, army, went, with, her, before, attacking, a, castle, belonging, to, the, rebellious, lusignan, family, who, threatened, to, switch, allegiance, to, louis, henry, then, went, about, his, own, business, outside, aquitaine, leaving, patrick, earl, of, salisbury, his, regional, military, commander, as, her, protective, custodian, when, patrick, was, killed, in, a, skirmish, with, the, lusignans, eleanor, who, proceeded, to, ransom, his, captured, nephew, the, young, william, marshal, was, left, in, control, of, her, lands, there, she, would, remain, until, 1173, a, move, that, facilitated, henry, s, control, over, a, corner, of, his, realm, where, the, vassals, were, continually, rebelling, this, move, also, led, to, speculation, of, a, marital, breakdown, by, 1168, eleanor, was, 44, years, old, and, had, born, eight, children, including, three, future, kings, and, her, childbearing, years, were, now, over, by, this, time, louis, vii, had, finally, been, given, a, son, by, his, third, wife, the, birth, of, philip, augustus, also, known, as, dieudonn, god, given, in, 1165, ended, henry, ii, s, attempts, to, add, the, throne, of, france, to, the, angevin, empire, through, dynastic, alliances, the, separation, of, eleanor, and, henry, during, the, next, five, years, has, been, the, subject, of, much, speculation, as, to, whether, it, was, predominantly, a, matter, of, political, expediency, an, indication, of, a, growing, rift, between, the, couple, or, both, certainly, eleanor, had, fulfilled, her, queenly, duties, of, providing, both, male, heirs, and, daughters, as, commodities, for, alliances, but, was, now, too, old, to, provide, further, children, also, she, successfully, set, about, restoring, order, in, proverbially, restless, aquitaine, and, continued, in, her, royal, duties, as, angevin, queen, including, acting, as, regent, in, various, french, territories, richard, of, devizes, suggested, it, was, eleanor, that, initiated, the, separation, and, that, henry, did, not, oppose, it, although, not, much, is, known, about, eleanor, s, whereabouts, during, this, period, christmas, 1168, was, spent, apart, henry, at, argentan, and, eleanor, at, poitiers, on, 6, january, 1169, henry, and, his, two, eldest, sons, met, with, louis, vii, at, montmirail, maine, the, resulting, treaty, of, montmirail, was, to, have, long, term, consequences, for, all, the, members, of, henry, s, family, in, the, treaty, henry, divided, his, domains, between, his, sons, and, betrothed, prince, richard, to, louis, daughter, alys, in, addition, to, keeping, his, vassals, in, order, and, maintaining, relations, with, the, french, king, henry, was, busy, creating, domestic, alliances, geoffrey, was, betrothed, to, constance, of, brittany, and, negotiations, were, begun, to, marry, joanna, to, king, william, ii, of, sicily, and, john, to, alicia, eldest, daughter, of, humbert, iii, count, of, savoy, to, further, secure, a, peaceful, succession, he, sought, to, continue, the, capetian, tradition, of, crowning, his, heir, prince, henry, despite, opposition, from, the, church, this, took, place, on, 14, june, 1170, and, from, then, on, he, was, referred, to, as, henry, the, young, king, while, henry, appeared, to, be, in, communication, during, this, period, it, is, not, evident, that, they, actually, saw, much, of, each, other, other, than, at, some, of, the, major, feasts, such, as, christmas, at, bur, le, roi, near, bayeux, in, 1170, and, at, chinon, in, 1172, while, there, were, rumours, of, alienation, between, the, couple, eleanor, did, begin, to, exert, increasing, autonomy, in, ruling, her, duchy, for, instance, she, changed, her, formal, address, to, omit, the, king, s, merely, stating, to, her, faithful, followers, during, this, period, relations, between, henry, ii, and, his, young, sons, became, increasingly, fractious, having, been, allocated, portions, of, the, angevin, empire, at, montmirail, they, were, eager, to, assume, their, powers, rather, than, wait, for, their, father, s, death, as, had, been, arranged, louis, vii, was, aware, of, this, and, now, that, the, young, king, was, his, son, in, law, saw, an, opportunity, to, exploit, these, divisions, in, november, 1172, louis, invited, his, daughter, queen, marguerite, and, the, seventeen, year, old, king, henry, to, paris, where, he, encouraged, the, former, s, ambitions, of, all, her, influence, on, culture, eleanor, s, time, in, poitiers, between, 1168, and, 1173, has, been, claimed, to, be, the, most, critical, yet, very, little, is, actually, known, about, it, henry, ii, was, occupied, with, his, own, affairs, after, escorting, eleanor, there, for, a, long, time, writers, dealing, with, this, period, stated, that, her, court, was, a, center, of, chivalry, and, the, troubadour, culture, this, evolved, further, into, the, tradition, that, in, conjunction, with, her, daughter, by, louis, vii, marie, of, champagne, she, presided, over, what, became, known, as, the, court, of, love, where, courtly, love, thrived, while, troubadours, both, attended, her, court, and, praised, her, the, court, of, love, was, a, later, literary, invention, this, emerged, from, a, late, 12th, century, treatise, known, as, the, art, of, courtly, love, or, tractatus, de, amore, et, de, amoris, remedio, by, andreas, capellanus, andrew, the, chaplain, capellanus, has, been, traditionally, described, as, chaplain, to, marie, of, champagne, in, troyes, and, the, work, appeared, long, after, the, period, of, eleanor, s, court, in, poitiers, and, is, largely, satirical, the, tractatus, stated, that, eleanor, together, with, marie, ermengarde, viscountess, of, narbonne, isabelle, of, flanders, and, other, ladies, would, sit, and, listen, to, the, quarrels, of, lovers, and, act, as, a, jury, to, the, questions, of, the, court, that, revolved, around, acts, of, romantic, love, he, records, some, twenty, one, cases, the, most, famous, of, them, being, a, problem, posed, to, the, women, about, whether, true, love, can, exist, in, marriage, according, to, capellanus, the, women, decided, that, it, was, not, at, all, likely, there, is, no, evidence, for, any, of, capellanus, claims, marie, never, visited, her, mother, and, the, court, at, which, capellanus, wrote, was, hostile, to, henry, ii, and, eleanor, despite, this, many, popular, accounts, such, as, the, biography, by, polly, schoyer, brooks, continue, to, give, credence, to, it, at, least, as, some, sort, of, parlor, game, there, is, no, evidence, to, the, claim, that, eleanor, invented, courtly, love, an, expression, that, only, appeared, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, concept, of, courtoisie, amour, courtois, fin, amor, was, a, set, of, attitudes, regarding, love, associated, with, the, courts, and, praised, by, troubadours, that, had, begun, to, grow, before, eleanor, s, poitier, period, her, paternal, grandfather, william, ix, 1071, 1126, was, considered, a, troubadour, who, extolled, the, growing, popularity, of, tales, of, love, and, chivalry, long, before, this, what, can, be, said, is, that, this, fin, amor, first, appeared, in, the, south, in, the, early, twelfth, century, became, popular, and, spread, north, and, that, there, were, troubadours, at, eleanor, s, court, such, as, bernart, de, ventadorn, and, arnaut, guilhem, de, marsan, as, at, other, occitan, courts, the, rest, is, merely, conjecture, the, legend, of, a, court, of, love, has, formed, an, important, element, in, what, has, been, referred, to, as, the, golden, myth, of, eleanor, s, life, from, 21, to, 28, february, 1173, henry, and, eleanor, were, together, at, montferrand, for, the, betrothal, of, prince, john, to, alice, of, maurienne, the, occasion, was, marred, by, open, conflict, between, the, two, henrys, over, the, delegation, of, powers, from, montferrat, the, royal, entourage, moved, to, limoges, where, matters, worsened, henry, and, his, son, then, headed, north, together, in, march, to, chinon, where, they, arrived, on, the, 5th, in, the, morning, henry, ii, discovered, his, son, had, escaped, his, custody, and, travelled, to, paris, and, louis, vii, the, latter, then, informed, king, henry, ii, that, he, was, now, supporting, his, son, as, the, new, reigning, monarch, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, revolt, of, 1173, 1174, later, chroniclers, assigned, much, of, the, blame, to, eleanor, adding, to, her, deepening, reputation, and, leading, to, much, speculation, regarding, motive, despite, lack, of, evidence, although, they, carefully, added, so, it, was, said, to, their, accounts, other, evidence, implicates, the, young, king, s, father, in, law, louis, vii, from, paris, william, of, newburgh, recounts, the, younger, henry, devising, evil, against, his, father, from, every, side, by, the, advice, of, the, french, king, went, secretly, into, aquitaine, where, his, two, youthful, brothers, richard, and, geoffrey, were, living, with, their, mother, and, with, her, connivance, so, it, is, said, he, incited, them, to, join, him, roger, of, hoveden, gives, a, somewhat, different, account, stating, that, eleanor, sent, the, younger, sons, to, france, and, their, older, brother, to, join, with, him, against, their, father, the, king, young, henry, and, his, brothers, then, returned, to, paris, in, the, spring, and, eleanor, encouraged, her, vassals, to, support, her, sons, later, in, april, eleanor, too, would, set, out, to, travel, to, paris, to, join, her, sons, but, she, was, seized, on, the, road, to, chartres, and, taken, to, henry, ii, in, rouen, the, king, did, not, announce, the, arrest, publicly, but, had, her, confined, and, for, the, next, year, the, queen, s, whereabouts, were, unknown, meanwhile, louis, held, court, in, paris, where, the, french, nobles, swore, allegiance, to, the, young, king, of, henry, ii, s, sons, only, seven, year, old, john, remained, with, his, father, hostilities, commenced, in, may, with, the, forces, of, young, henry, and, louis, vii, s, invading, normandy, although, neither, side, prevailed, during, 1173, after, a, brief, winter, truce, henry, ii, entered, poitiers, in, may, 1174, and, took, his, daughter, joanna, together, with, other, noble, ladies, back, to, his, stronghold, in, normandy, on, either, 7, or, 8, july, 1174, henry, ii, facing, imminent, invasion, of, england, took, ship, and, sailed, with, eleanor, john, joanna, and, the, other, ladies, from, barfleur, to, southampton, from, where, eleanor, was, taken, to, an, unknown, place, of, confinement, while, henry, ii, was, ultimately, victorious, and, made, some, concessions, to, his, sons, at, the, treaty, of, montlouis, on, 30, september, 1174, eleanor, was, confined, to, various, degrees, for, the, rest, of, henry, s, life, in, various, locations, in, england, about, which, there, is, very, little, information, although, pipe, rolls, refer, to, ludgershall, castle, buckinghamshire, and, various, houses, in, berkshire, and, nottinghamshire, gerald, of, wales, states, that, henry, considered, having, his, marriage, annulled, on, the, grounds, of, consanguinity, during, 1175, requesting, a, visit, from, a, papal, legate, to, discuss, the, matter, further, and, meeting, with, cardinal, pierlone, at, winchester, on, 1, november, who, dissuaded, him, from, this, course, in, early, 1176, he, tried, again, by, persuading, eleanor, to, become, a, nun, at, fontevrault, she, then, requested, the, archbishop, of, rouen, to, intervene, and, he, supported, her, refusal, prompting, henry, to, once, again, attempt, to, seek, papal, approval, which, was, denied, meanwhile, henry, continued, his, use, of, his, children, to, forge, alliances, in, the, summer, of, 1176, eleanor, was, at, winchester, with, joanna, then, eleven, as, soon, as, plans, for, her, marriage, to, william, ii, of, sicily, were, concluded, she, was, sent, there, on, 27, august, the, marriage, taking, place, on, 13, february, 1177, on, 28, september, 1176, john, was, betrothed, to, isabella, of, gloucester, also, known, as, hawise, who, was, his, cousin, and, was, three, years, old, in, september, 1177, princess, eleanor, left, for, castille, and, was, married, to, alfonso, viii, in, burgos, while, geoffrey, was, married, to, constance, of, brittany, in, july, 1181, while, eleanor, remained, confined, she, was, not, strictly, a, prisoner, but, rather, in, a, form, of, house, arrest, although, stripped, of, her, revenues, and, in, the, later, part, of, this, period, enjoyed, some, greater, freedoms, from, 1177, onwards, and, particularly, after, 1184, and, would, witness, the, death, of, two, more, of, her, sons, henry, and, geoffrey, and, her, daughter, matilda, but, very, little, information, exists, about, these, years, during, her, imprisonment, eleanor, became, more, and, more, distant, from, her, sons, since, henry, ii, could, not, afford, having, her, in, communication, with, them, and, possibly, plotting, against, him, this, was, especially, so, for, richard, her, heir, in, aquitaine, who, had, always, been, her, favourite, she, did, not, have, the, opportunity, to, see, her, sons, very, often, during, her, imprisonment, though, she, was, released, for, special, occasions, such, as, easter, 1176, rosamund, clifford, died, in, 1176, or, 1177, at, godstow, oxfordshire, henry, erected, a, tomb, in, the, abbey, and, gave, gifts, to, the, abbey, in, her, memory, her, death, would, much, later, lead, to, myths, concerning, eleanor, s, putative, involvement, that, grew, more, elaborate, over, the, centuries, and, for, a, long, time, were, accepted, as, established, facts, further, building, her, black, legend, despite, virtually, no, contemporary, evidence, to, support, this, some, chroniclers, including, gerald, of, wales, ralph, niger, roger, of, hoveden, and, ranulf, higden, state, that, henry, then, began, an, affair, with, the, sixteen, year, old, alys, of, france, a, matter, complicated, by, the, fact, that, she, was, betrothed, to, his, son, richard, and, was, also, the, daughter, of, louis, vii, who, became, alarmed, on, hearing, this, news, in, the, meantime, henry, delayed, the, marriage, which, richard, was, now, resisting, and, alys, bore, henry, several, children, the, years, of, eleanor, s, confinement, were, marked, by, almost, constant, warfare, between, their, sons, and, rebellious, vassals, especially, aquitaine, between, each, other, and, with, their, father, the, situation, became, further, complicated, by, the, death, of, the, ailing, louis, vii, on, 18, september, 1180, and, the, succession, of, his, son, philip, ii, philip, who, was, the, brother, in, law, of, henry, the, young, the, heir, apparent, was, even, more, determined, than, his, father, to, regain, the, french, lands, of, henry, and, his, sons, and, to, exploit, the, conflicts, in, that, dysfunctional, family, during, one, of, these, campaigns, eleanor, s, son, henry, died, of, dysentery, on, 11, june, 1183, at, martel, quercy, at, the, age, of, twenty, eight, his, dying, wishes, included, a, plea, for, his, mother, to, be, set, free, and, that, his, wife, marguerite, be, provided, for, henry, ii, sent, thomas, agnell, thomas, of, early, archdeacon, of, wells, to, eleanor, at, sarum, to, inform, her, of, her, son, s, death, he, later, described, how, she, told, him, she, had, a, premonition, in, a, dream, many, years, later, in, 1193, she, related, to, pope, celestine, iii, how, much, she, was, tortured, by, her, memories, of, the, young, king, henry, s, death, as, heir, apparent, changed, the, family, dynamics, leaving, richard, as, the, new, heir, as, a, result, of, the, young, king, s, death, and, his, wish, for, marguerite, s, lands, to, be, protected, henry, ii, found, himself, in, conflict, with, philip, ii, marguerite, s, half, brother, philip, claimed, that, certain, properties, in, normandy, and, england, belonged, to, marguerite, but, henry, insisted, that, they, had, once, belonged, to, eleanor, and, would, revert, to, her, upon, her, son, s, death, it, was, therefore, politically, expedient, that, eleanor, be, seen, in, the, disputed, territories, and, henry, summoned, her, to, normandy, in, the, late, summer, of, 1183, this, marked, the, beginning, of, a, loosening, of, the, restrictions, on, her, roger, of, hovenden, states, that, the, king, commanded, she, be, freed, and, that, she, make, a, progress, about, her, dowerlands, her, income, also, improved, geoffroy, du, brueil, states, that, she, remained, in, normandy, for, about, six, months, young, henry, s, death, necessitated, a, renegotiation, of, the, treaty, of, montmirail, and, the, contentious, question, of, richard, s, betrothal, to, alys, resulting, in, a, further, meeting, of, the, english, and, french, kings, at, gisors, normandy, on, 6, december, 1183, at, which, time, henry, revoked, much, of, the, land, concessions, he, had, made, earlier, eleanor, returned, to, england, in, early, 1184, where, her, daughter, matilda, and, son, in, law, henry, now, in, exile, were, able, to, stay, with, her, at, winchester, and, then, berkhamsted, at, winchester, matilda, gave, birth, to, her, fifth, child, william, on, 30, november, at, westminster, eleanor, and, henry, presided, over, another, unsuccessful, attempt, to, bring, peace, with, their, warring, sons, and, settle, their, inheritance, and, the, family, spent, christmas, at, windsor, in, early, 1185, they, journeyed, to, normandy, where, a, further, family, council, took, place, in, may, she, would, remain, in, normandy, for, nearly, a, year, the, royal, couple, returning, to, southampton, from, barfleur, england, on, 27, april, 1186, spending, the, summer, together, at, winchester, though, there, is, very, little, information, on, her, whereabouts, from, then, till, 1189, however, even, in, aquitaine, affairs, it, was, clear, she, had, little, freedom, to, act, stating, that, her, acts, were, with, the, assent, and, at, the, will, of, her, lord, henry, king, of, england, and, of, richard, geoffrey, and, john, her, sons, the, family, situation, changed, further, when, geoffrey, died, in, paris, on, 18, or, 19, august, 1186, leaving, only, richard, and, john, as, heirs, but, conflict, between, them, and, with, their, father, continued, over, their, inheritance, and, richard, made, yet, another, attempt, at, adding, toulouse, to, the, aquitaine, domain, bringing, henry, and, philip, into, direct, conflict, once, more, which, would, lead, to, twenty, seven, years, of, intermittent, war, this, time, richard, and, philip, combined, their, forces, against, an, ailing, henry, forcing, him, to, relinquish, much, of, his, french, possessions, after, john, joined, this, alliance, against, his, father, henry, s, health, deteriorated, further, and, he, died, at, chinon, on, 6, july, 1189, aged, fifty, six, at, around, this, time, eleanor, also, received, news, of, matilda, s, death, over, the, last, few, years, eleanor, had, often, travelled, with, her, husband, and, was, sometimes, associated, with, him, in, the, government, of, the, realm, but, still, had, a, custodian, so, that, she, was, never, fully, free, henry, s, death, ended, a, marriage, which, has, been, described, as, tumultuous, and, eleanor, s, long, years, of, imprisonment, upon, the, death, of, henry, ii, on, 6, july, 1189, richard, i, was, the, undisputed, heir, one, of, his, first, acts, as, king, was, to, send, william, marshal, to, england, with, orders, to, release, the, sixty, five, year, old, eleanor, from, prison, he, found, upon, his, arrival, that, her, custodians, had, already, released, her, whereupon, she, assumed, the, powers, of, regent, bestowed, upon, her, by, richard, who, was, still, in, france, eleanor, then, rode, to, westminster, and, received, the, oaths, of, fealty, from, the, lords, and, prelates, on, behalf, of, the, new, king, she, ruled, england, in, richard, s, name, now, signing, herself, eleanor, by, the, grace, of, god, queen, of, england, and, reversed, many, of, henry, ii, s, acts, on, 13, august, 1189, richard, sailed, from, barfleur, to, portsmouth, and, was, received, with, enthusiasm, proceeding, from, there, to, winchester, to, meet, eleanor, at, this, time, eleanor, s, two, surviving, sons, were, unmarried, raising, questions, about, succession, however, on, 29, august, prince, john, carried, out, his, father, s, wishes, marrying, his, cousin, isabella, to, whom, he, had, been, betrothed, in, 1176, on, 3, september, richard, was, crowned, at, westminster, abbey, with, eleanor, and, john, in, attendance, following, the, coronation, richard, was, preoccupied, with, a, long, planned, participation, in, the, third, crusade, and, on, his, first, absence, from, the, kingdom, in, november, on, a, pilgrimage, appointed, eleanor, regent, on, his, return, he, made, more, formal, arrangements, prior, to, his, more, prolonged, departure, for, the, crusade, on, 12, december, appointing, as, custodians, his, justiciar, hugh, de, puiset, together, with, william, de, longchamp, as, summi, justifiarii, although, eleanor, had, no, formal, appointment, in, england, during, this, time, they, deferred, to, her, authority, on, 2, february, 1190, eleanor, joined, richard, at, the, chateau, of, bures, normandy, where, he, continued, to, make, preparations, and, a, family, conclave, was, held, at, nonancourt, with, john, in, attendance, at, which, arrangements, for, the, administration, of, england, in, the, king, s, absence, were, finalised, meanwhile, although, john, had, married, the, question, of, succession, still, remained, and, in, particular, the, problem, of, alys, to, whom, richard, was, betrothed, yet, had, been, in, a, relationship, with, his, father, but, was, also, king, philip, s, half, sister, it, was, during, the, spring, of, 1190, that, negotiations, began, with, the, navarrese, house, of, jim, nez, regarding, berengaria, daughter, of, sancho, vi, of, navarre, though, such, an, alliance, would, require, the, approval, of, philip, in, breaking, richard, s, betrothal, such, an, alliance, would, serve, the, purpose, of, stabilising, matters, in, gascony, however, richard, and, philip, finally, departed, on, their, crusade, on, 4, july, 1190, once, richard, had, set, off, eleanor, sent, prince, john, to, england, while, she, travelled, to, navarre, meeting, the, twenty, five, year, old, berengaria, and, her, father, at, pamplona, from, there, she, escorted, berengaria, to, sicily, where, richard, had, arrived, at, messina, in, messina, richard, found, that, his, sister, joanna, widowed, since, november, 1189, was, being, held, prisoner, he, was, also, in, conflict, with, philip, partly, over, the, matter, of, alys, as, a, result, of, which, eleanor, s, ship, was, refused, landing, at, messina, and, had, to, proceed, to, brindisi, by, march, 1191, richard, had, secured, joanna, s, release, and, joined, eleanor, and, berengaria, at, reggio, from, where, the, latter, was, placed, in, joanna, s, care, richard, then, confronted, philip, with, the, matter, of, alys, relationship, with, henry, ii, as, the, reason, for, breaking, the, betrothal, and, philip, promptly, departed, for, the, holy, land, prior, to, the, arrival, of, eleanor, in, messina, by, the, time, eleanor, had, reached, sicily, stories, of, misrule, and, conflict, in, england, between, longchamp, and, prince, john, had, emerged, walter, de, coutances, archbishop, of, rouen, was, appointed, to, reestablish, royal, authority, in, england, and, he, and, eleanor, began, their, return, journey, after, only, four, days, departing, on, 2, april, 1191, for, salerno, from, there, they, travelled, to, rome, arriving, on, the, 14th, to, meet, with, the, new, pope, celestine, iii, to, obtain, his, approval, of, appointing, walter, de, coutances, over, william, de, longchamp, who, also, served, as, a, papal, legate, on, 10, april, 1191, richard, and, berengaria, together, with, joanna, left, sicily, with, the, women, on, a, separate, ship, bound, for, outremer, but, storms, diverted, them, to, cyprus, where, richard, and, berengaria, were, married, on, 12, may, at, limasol, and, berengaria, was, crowned, they, then, sailed, to, the, holy, land, on, 5, june, arriving, at, acre, on, the, 8th, which, richard, captured, king, philip, abandoned, the, crusade, on, 2, july, and, returned, to, france, but, in, the, meantime, richard, had, found, himself, in, conflict, with, duke, leopold, of, austria, an, event, which, would, have, serious, consequences, for, him, later, once, eleanor, reached, rouen, where, she, arrived, on, 24, june, 1191, she, was, able, to, direct, affairs, in, england, better, although, she, spent, the, winter, of, 1191, 1192, in, france, eleanor, s, new, role, softened, the, criticisms, she, had, accumulated, with, richard, of, devizes, describing, her, as, incomparable, and, she, began, using, the, phrase, teste, me, ipsa, as, my, own, witness, on, official, documents, in, england, while, coutance, tried, to, restore, order, longchamp, was, eventually, deposed, and, prince, john, began, to, consolidate, power, claiming, he, was, the, heir, presumptive, coutance, was, appointed, head, of, a, regency, council, and, longchamp, fled, to, france, attempting, unsuccessfully, to, recruit, eleanor, to, his, cause, her, position, became, more, complicated, with, the, return, of, king, philip, from, the, holy, land, in, late, 1191, who, not, only, attempted, to, undermine, richard, s, reputation, but, demanded, the, return, of, alys, still, in, eleanor, s, care, in, early, 1192, philip, recruited, prince, john, to, his, cause, offering, him, lands, and, alys, prompting, eleanor, s, return, to, england, on, 11, february, to, prevent, john, s, invasion, of, normandy, however, she, spent, much, of, that, year, dealing, with, ecclesiastical, disputes, and, curbing, the, ambitions, of, longchamp, and, john, in, the, holy, land, richard, made, little, progress, in, his, quest, to, capture, jerusalem, and, by, late, 1192, was, forced, to, arrange, a, truce, with, saladin, and, sent, joanna, and, berengaria, back, to, sicily, in, september, departing, from, acre, himself, on, 9, october, following, which, his, whereabouts, were, unknown, till, january, 1193, when, eleanor, learned, that, he, had, been, taken, prisoner, by, duke, leopold, whom, he, had, slighted, on, his, arrival, in, acre, richard, had, travelled, north, from, trieste, through, hungary, but, when, he, crossed, into, austria, he, was, recognised, apprehended, and, taken, to, d, rnstein, castle, leopold, informed, the, emperor, henry, vi, who, wrote, to, king, philip, of, france, who, in, turn, supported, this, turn, of, events, eleanor, only, became, aware, of, what, had, happened, through, coutances, spies, in, france, but, immediately, assumed, control, of, the, government, while, prince, john, with, philip, s, support, became, emboldened, once, more, in, claiming, the, throne, leopold, handed, over, his, prisoner, to, the, emperor, in, february, and, he, was, moved, to, the, castle, of, trifels, while, eleanor, unsuccessfully, sought, the, intervention, of, the, pope, eventually, a, truce, was, concluded, with, prince, john, in, april, but, eleanor, also, received, a, demand, from, the, emperor, for, 100, 000, silver, marks, and, the, provision, of, hostages, for, richard, s, release, at, the, same, time, she, received, the, first, letter, from, him, since, his, capture, urging, her, to, accept, the, terms, and, informing, her, that, his, conditions, had, much, improved, and, that, he, had, been, transferred, to, hagenau, eleanor, and, her, council, immediately, set, about, trying, to, raise, the, ransom, and, arrange, the, hostages, a, task, to, which, beregnaria, now, in, poitou, contributed, largely, through, taxation, of, all, of, richard, s, territories, and, subjects, the, first, installment, of, 100, 000, marks, was, delivered, in, october, and, the, balance, was, raised, by, december, having, agreed, to, a, date, for, richard, s, release, on, 17, january, 1194, eleanor, and, coutances, set, off, for, germany, in, december, 1193, arriving, at, speyer, by, the, agreed, day, there, she, discovered, that, king, philip, and, prince, john, had, outbid, her, in, return, for, keeping, richard, in, custody, further, negotiations, and, offers, including, an, annual, tribute, eventually, led, to, him, being, released, on, 4, february, they, immediately, began, their, return, via, cologne, eventually, arriving, in, antwerp, where, they, boarded, the, trenchemer, in, the, scheldt, to, avoid, the, french, landing, in, sandwich, on, 12, march, richard, and, eleanor, then, made, a, triumphal, entry, into, london, on, 23, march, 1194, eleanor, and, richard, s, stay, in, england, was, relatively, brief, since, feeling, the, need, to, defend, his, french, possessions, from, philip, richard, departed, from, portsmouth, on, 12, may, 1194, arriving, in, barflueur, neither, richard, nor, eleanor, would, return, to, england, there, they, effected, a, reconciliation, with, prince, john, that, would, last, through, the, rest, of, richard, s, reign, leaving, the, latter, free, to, defend, his, territory, against, philip, while, eleanor, now, seventy, two, retired, to, fontevrault, and, there, is, very, little, information, available, about, her, for, the, next, few, years, though, she, made, the, abbey, her, principal, residence, for, the, rest, of, her, life, the, marriage, of, her, daughter, joanna, to, raymond, vi, of, toulouse, in, october, 1196, finally, ended, eleanor, s, dynastic, claims, on, toulouse, which, now, passed, to, her, daughter, richard, was, in, a, state, of, almost, perpetual, war, with, the, french, king, following, his, return, to, normandy, in, 1194, and, finally, succumbed, to, a, wound, on, 6, april, 1199, at, the, age, of, forty, one, with, eleanor, at, his, side, initially, prior, to, richard, arriving, in, england, he, delegated, authority, to, eleanor, statuendi, quae, vellet, in, regno, though, this, was, not, repeated, during, richard, s, subsequent, prolonged, absences, royal, authority, in, england, was, represented, by, a, succession, of, chief, justiciars, the, justiciars, included, william, de, longchamp, 1190, 1191, hugh, de, puiset, 1189, 1190, walter, de, coutances, 1191, 1193, and, hubert, walter, 1193, 1198, on, longchamp, s, dismissal, in, 1191, government, moved, to, a, more, conciliar, mode, magnum, concilium, and, communitas, regni, under, coutance, richard, and, berengaria, had, no, children, and, on, richard, s, death, one, of, the, first, things, eleanor, did, was, to, warn, john, to, flee, from, brittany, where, he, was, with, arthur, i, duke, of, brittany, eleanor, s, grandson, and, secure, richard, s, possessions, arthur, was, the, only, son, of, eleanor, s, fourth, son, geoffrey, and, his, wife, constance, he, had, been, considered, to, be, richard, s, heir, being, the, son, of, john, s, older, brother, and, hence, had, a, claim, on, the, throne, there, being, no, other, male, heirs, richard, himself, though, having, considered, arthur, had, declared, john, to, be, his, successor, prior, to, his, death, king, philip, was, quick, to, exploit, the, possibility, of, an, angevin, succession, war, proclaiming, the, twelve, year, old, arthur, as, the, new, king, who, in, turn, swore, allegiance, to, philip, for, his, french, possessions, whereupon, the, breton, army, advanced, on, angers, and, captured, it, followed, by, anjou, maine, and, touraine, declaring, their, allegiance, to, arthur, eleanor, immediately, acted, to, repel, the, bretons, arthur, withdrew, with, philip, to, paris, and, john, was, officially, invested, as, duke, of, normandy, on, 25, april, 1199, while, eleanor, toured, all, her, domains, raising, support, for, john, whom, she, had, declared, the, rightful, heir, and, on, 25, may, 1199, john, arrived, in, england, and, was, crowned, king, on, 27, may, although, he, was, back, in, normandy, by, 20, june, where, he, concluded, a, truce, at, the, same, time, eleanor, also, made, peace, with, philip, and, pledged, her, allegiance, as, a, vassal, she, had, come, to, an, arrangement, with, john, whereby, she, would, officially, declare, him, her, heir, and, cede, her, french, possessions, to, him, while, retaining, her, right, to, them, during, her, lifetime, as, his, domina, this, helped, to, safeguard, them, from, philip, in, the, event, of, her, death, john, and, isabella, had, no, children, and, he, needed, an, heir, to, secure, succession, and, in, 1199, he, had, his, marriage, annulled, on, the, grounds, of, consanguinity, in, september, that, year, joanna, died, in, childbirth, at, fontevrault, where, she, was, buried, leaving, eleanor, with, only, two, surviving, children, john, of, england, and, eleanor, of, castile, despite, their, truce, conflict, between, john, arthur, and, philip, continued, intermittently, till, a, further, arrangement, was, put, in, place, at, le, mans, sometime, after, christmas, 1199, among, other, provisions, the, new, truce, cemented, dynastic, alliances, through, the, marriage, of, the, twelve, year, old, louis, king, philip, s, heir, to, one, of, john, s, nieces, in, castile, and, the, payment, of, 30, 000, marks, by, john, to, philip, this, was, formalised, in, the, treaty, of, le, goulet, of, may, 1200, subsequently, john, returned, to, england, to, raise, the, money, while, eleanor, travelled, to, castile, to, select, a, suitable, bride, on, the, way, she, was, kidnapped, just, south, of, poitiers, by, hugh, ix, of, lusignan, one, of, her, vassals, hugh, demanded, she, cede, him, the, county, of, la, marche, sold, long, ago, by, one, of, his, ancestors, to, henry, ii, which, she, acceded, to, so, that, she, could, complete, her, mission, she, finally, arrived, in, castile, by, the, end, of, january, 1200, eleanor, of, castile, had, two, unmarried, daughters, and, of, those, eleanor, chose, the, younger, blanche, then, sixteen, years, old, she, remained, there, till, late, march, to, avoid, lent, during, which, marriages, could, not, be, solemnised, arriving, in, bordeaux, at, easter, on, 9, april, travelling, on, to, the, loire, she, entrusted, blanche, to, the, archbishop, of, bordeaux, who, escorted, her, to, meet, king, john, while, eleanor, once, more, returned, to, fontevrault, while, there, she, undertook, a, major, reconstruction, of, her, ducal, palace, in, poitiers, originally, merovingian, but, now, being, rebuilt, in, the, angevin, style, blanche, and, louis, were, married, on, 23, may, 1200, she, bore, him, 12, children, one, of, whom, was, the, future, louis, ix, of, france, ensuring, that, eleanor, s, descendants, would, be, future, rulers, of, france, john, visited, eleanor, at, fontevault, in, the, early, summer, hearing, she, was, unwell, amongst, the, advice, she, gave, him, was, to, secure, the, loyalty, of, her, vassals, should, she, die, and, in, particular, hugh, of, lusignan, to, whom, she, had, granted, la, marche, the, previous, year, making, him, the, new, count, john, arrived, at, lusignan, castle, on, 5, july, where, he, encountered, the, thirteen, year, old, isabelle, of, angouleme, and, sought, her, hand, in, marriage, from, her, parents, while, breaking, off, negotiations, with, the, portuguese, court, however, isabelle, was, already, betrothed, to, hugh, of, lusignan, whom, he, had, dispatched, to, england, while, there, were, potential, political, advantages, to, such, an, alliance, under, the, circumstances, this, was, a, mistake, that, would, soon, have, serious, consequences, the, marriage, between, john, and, isabelle, took, place, in, secret, in, bordeaux, on, 24, august, and, they, then, proceeded, to, england, where, she, was, crowned, queen, at, westminster, abbey, on, 8, october, 1200, king, john, ignored, the, lusignans, protests, over, the, betrayal, whereupon, they, rose, in, rebellion, in, early, 1201, eleanor, though, in, ill, health, once, more, intervened, to, restore, peace, in, february, and, march, summoning, arthur, as, an, intermediary, with, king, philip, but, john, continued, to, seek, vengeance, on, the, lusignans, and, conflict, simmered, throughout, 1201, on, 28, april, 1202, freed, from, some, of, his, other, commitments, philip, summoned, john, to, his, court, and, upon, his, refusal, declared, him, a, traitor, and, in, lieu, of, his, lands, john, s, position, became, more, perilous, when, philip, betrothed, his, daughter, marie, to, the, fifteen, year, old, arthur, in, july, and, declared, him, to, be, the, rightful, lord, of, the, angevin, possessions, under, philip, s, orders, arthur, proceeded, to, poitou, to, seize, his, new, inheritance, this, prompted, eleanor, to, set, out, for, poitiers, from, fontevrault, but, on, the, way, found, herself, besieged, by, arthur, and, hugh, in, mirebeau, castle, near, the, angevin, border, and, just, north, of, poitiers, urgently, summoning, john, to, aid, her, john, received, the, news, on, 30, july, and, reached, mirebeau, on, 1, august, where, he, found, that, the, defences, were, already, breached, but, was, able, to, lift, the, siege, release, eleanor, and, take, both, arthur, and, the, lusignans, into, his, custody, arthur, was, last, seen, entering, falaise, castle, in, normandy, as, a, prisoner, on, 10, august, eleanor, had, demanded, a, promise, of, clemency, for, arthur, but, little, was, heard, of, him, for, some, time, despite, an, attempt, to, free, him, in, the, autumn, of, 1202, on, her, return, to, fontevrault, eleanor, took, the, veil, as, a, nun, by, the, end, of, 1202, rumours, were, circulating, about, arthur, s, death, but, john, had, the, youth, brought, before, him, in, january, 1203, at, falaise, asking, him, to, switch, his, allegiance, from, philip, instead, arthur, demanded, that, john, grant, to, him, all, his, possessions, according, to, philip, s, declaration, arthur, s, threats, were, sufficient, for, some, of, the, king, s, advisers, to, suggest, he, be, eliminated, as, a, danger, to, the, security, of, the, realm, rumours, of, his, assassination, persisted, and, subsequent, events, have, been, the, matter, of, speculation, other, than, that, he, was, transferred, to, rouen, on, 8, march, and, in, april, his, gaoler, announced, he, was, relinquishing, his, role, which, is, the, last, record, of, his, existence, john, was, commonly, blamed, for, his, nephew, s, disappearance, and, found, himself, increasingly, isolated, over, the, spring, of, 1203, providing, an, opportunity, for, philip, who, progressively, annexed, normandy, throughout, the, rest, of, the, year, john, leaving, for, england, to, muster, support, on, 6, december, the, french, and, breton, conquest, of, normandy, continued, in, early, 1204, with, most, of, the, significant, strongholds, captured, by, the, end, of, march, it, is, unclear, if, eleanor, was, aware, of, the, progressive, destruction, of, the, empire, she, and, henry, ii, had, ruled, and, which, she, had, fought, to, preserve, for, her, sons, one, source, from, fontevrault, suggests, that, she, had, become, unaware, of, her, surroundings, during, the, last, few, months, eleanor, of, aquitaine, at, the, age, of, eighty, died, at, fontevraud, on, either, 31, march, or, 1, april, 1204, and, was, entombed, in, the, crypt, of, the, abbey, between, richard, i, and, henry, ii, the, tomb, effigy, is, by, a, different, hand, and, more, advanced, in, the, use, of, three, dimensions, than, the, earlier, two, her, daughter, joanna, lay, nearby, eleanor, s, tomb, lies, under, a, painted, stone, gisant, effigy, of, the, queen, wearing, a, crown, and, with, an, open, book, in, her, hands, the, tomb, is, considered, one, of, the, finest, of, those, few, that, survive, from, this, period, during, the, french, revolution, the, abbey, was, sacked, and, the, tombs, vandalised, while, the, human, remains, were, exhumed, and, scattered, and, have, never, been, located, although, most, of, the, tombs, were, later, restored, and, lie, in, the, church, contemporary, sources, praise, eleanor, s, beauty, even, in, an, era, when, ladies, of, the, nobility, were, excessively, eulogised, and, praised, their, praise, of, her, was, undoubtedly, sincere, though, probably, based, on, hearsay, while, is, some, cases, the, reference, is, only, implied, the, medieval, german, songs, known, as, carmina, burana, praise, england, s, queen, and, a, minnesinger, refers, to, the, sweet, young, queen, benoit, de, sainte, maure, wrote, of, the, queen, of, beauty, and, largesse, in, the, roman, de, troie, while, philippe, de, thaun, wrote, god, save, lady, eleanor, queen, who, is, the, arbiter, of, honour, wit, and, beauty, when, she, was, young, she, was, described, as, perpulchra, more, than, beautiful, when, she, was, around, 30, bernard, de, ventadour, a, noted, troubadour, called, her, gracious, lovely, the, embodiment, of, charm, extolling, her, lovely, eyes, and, noble, countenance, and, declaring, that, she, was, one, meet, to, crown, the, state, of, any, king, william, of, newburgh, emphasised, the, charms, of, her, person, and, even, in, her, old, age, richard, of, devizes, described, her, as, beautiful, while, matthew, paris, writing, in, the, 13th, century, recalled, her, admirable, beauty, a, common, practice, at, the, time, and, a, woman, of, wonderful, appearance, more, beautiful, than, moral, and, a, wonderful, lady, most, beautiful, and, astute, richard, of, devizes, was, similarly, exuberant, but, not, all, were, in, agreement, william, of, tyre, dismissed, her, as, uxorem, quae, una, erat, de, fatuis, mulieribus, another, chronicler, describes, her, as, avenante, vaillante, courtoise, in, spite, of, all, these, words, of, praise, no, one, left, a, detailed, description, of, eleanor, for, instance, the, colour, of, her, hair, and, eyes, are, unknown, such, details, were, of, little, interest, to, contemporary, chroniclers, portraiture, was, not, a, characteristic, of, the, time, with, no, attempt, at, realism, while, descriptions, were, largely, rhetorical, despite, this, many, biographers, have, attempted, to, describe, her, and, elizabeth, chadwick, dismisses, all, these, as, fantasy, or, based, on, misinformation, the, effigy, on, her, tomb, almost, certainly, not, a, true, portrait, shows, a, tall, and, large, boned, woman, with, brown, skin, her, seal, of, c, 1152, shows, a, woman, with, a, slender, figure, but, these, were, impersonal, images, intended, to, convey, authority, images, of, eleanor, are, common, throughout, history, but, since, there, are, none, from, her, lifetime, these, are, purely, speculative, some, romanesque, carvings, such, as, those, at, the, cloisters, in, new, york, and, chartres, and,

writes, that, this, includes, the, very, worst, historical, writing, devoted, to, the, european, middle, ages, and, concludes, that, the, eleanor, of, history, has, been, overshadowed, by, an, eleanor, of, wishful, thinking, and, make, believe, legends, about, her, started, during, her, lifetime, and, rapidly, grew, and, much, of, it, appears, in, the, chronicles, of, the, late, twelfth,

reliable, information, about, eleanor, herself, biographers, have, largely, focused, on, the, people, around, her, and, the, political, and, cultural, events, of, her, time, her, importance, lies, not, so, much, on, who, she, was, as, what, she, was, in, the, words, of, one, chronicler, wife, of, two, kings, and, mother, of, three, while, her, longevity, allowed, her, to, be, an, influence, on, many, people, who, had, shorter, life, spans, it, was, not, uncommon, in, contemporary, literature, for, authors, to, dedicate, their, works, to, nobility, seeking, favours, but, this, does, not,
