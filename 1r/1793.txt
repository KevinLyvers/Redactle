friedrich, ludwig, gottlob, frege, f, r, e, german, 8, november, 1848, 26, july, 1925, was, a, german, philosopher, logician, and, mathematician, he, was, a, mathematics, professor, at, the, university, of, jena, and, is, understood, by, many, to, be, the, father, of, analytic, philosophy, concentrating, on, the, philosophy, of, language, logic, and, mathematics, though, he, was, largely, ignored, during, his, lifetime, giuseppe, peano, 1858, 1932, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, and, to, some, extent, ludwig, wittgenstein, 1889, 1951, introduced, his, work, to, later, generations, of, philosophers, frege, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, greatest, logician, since, aristotle, and, one, of, the, most, profound, philosophers, of, mathematics, ever, his, contributions, include, the, development, of, modern, logic, in, the, begriffsschrift, and, work, in, the, foundations, of, mathematics, his, book, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, is, the, seminal, text, of, the, logicist, project, and, is, cited, by, michael, dummett, as, where, to, pinpoint, the, linguistic, turn, his, philosophical, papers, on, sense, and, reference, and, the, thought, are, also, widely, cited, the, former, argues, for, two, different, types, of, meaning, and, descriptivism, in, foundations, and, the, thought, frege, argues, for, platonism, against, psychologism, or, formalism, concerning, numbers, and, propositions, respectively, frege, was, born, in, 1848, in, wismar, mecklenburg, schwerin, today, part, of, mecklenburg, vorpommern, his, father, carl, karl, alexander, frege, 1809, 1866, was, the, co, founder, and, headmaster, of, a, girls, high, school, until, his, death, after, carl, s, death, the, school, was, led, by, frege, s, mother, auguste, wilhelmine, sophie, frege, n, e, bialloblotzky, 12, january, 1815, 14, october, 1898, her, mother, was, auguste, amalia, maria, ballhorn, a, descendant, of, philipp, melanchthon, and, her, father, was, johann, heinrich, siegfried, bialloblotzky, a, descendant, of, a, polish, noble, family, who, left, poland, in, the, 17th, century, frege, was, a, lutheran, in, childhood, frege, encountered, philosophies, that, would, guide, his, future, scientific, career, for, example, his, father, wrote, a, textbook, on, the, german, language, for, children, aged, 9, 13, entitled, h, lfsbuch, zum, unterrichte, in, der, deutschen, sprache, f, r, kinder, von, 9, bis, 13, jahren, 2nd, ed, wismar, 1850, 3rd, ed, wismar, and, ludwigslust, hinstorff, 1862, help, book, for, teaching, german, to, children, from, 9, to, 13, years, old, the, first, section, of, which, dealt, with, the, structure, and, logic, of, language, frege, studied, at, gro, e, stadtschule, wismar, and, graduated, in, 1869, teacher, of, mathematics, and, natural, science, gustav, adolf, leo, sachse, 1843, 1909, who, was, also, a, poet, played, an, important, role, in, determining, frege, s, future, scientific, career, encouraging, him, to, continue, his, studies, at, his, own, alma, mater, the, university, of, jena, frege, matriculated, at, the, university, of, jena, in, the, spring, of, 1869, as, a, citizen, of, the, north, german, confederation, in, the, four, semesters, of, his, studies, he, attended, approximately, twenty, courses, of, lectures, most, of, them, on, mathematics, and, physics, his, most, important, teacher, was, ernst, karl, abbe, 1840, 1905, physicist, mathematician, and, inventor, abbe, gave, lectures, on, theory, of, gravity, galvanism, and, electrodynamics, complex, analysis, theory, of, functions, of, a, complex, variable, applications, of, physics, selected, divisions, of, mechanics, and, mechanics, of, solids, abbe, was, more, than, a, teacher, to, frege, he, was, a, trusted, friend, and, as, director, of, the, optical, manufacturer, carl, zeiss, ag, he, was, in, a, position, to, advance, frege, s, career, after, frege, s, graduation, they, came, into, closer, correspondence, his, other, notable, university, teachers, were, christian, philipp, karl, snell, 1806, 86, subjects, use, of, infinitesimal, analysis, in, geometry, analytic, geometry, of, planes, analytical, mechanics, optics, physical, foundations, of, mechanics, hermann, karl, julius, traugott, schaeffer, 1824, 1900, analytic, geometry, applied, physics, algebraic, analysis, on, the, telegraph, and, other, electronic, machines, and, the, philosopher, kuno, fischer, 1824, 1907, kantian, and, critical, philosophy, starting, in, 1871, frege, continued, his, studies, in, g, ttingen, the, leading, university, in, mathematics, in, german, speaking, territories, where, he, attended, the, lectures, of, rudolf, friedrich, alfred, clebsch, 1833, 72, analytic, geometry, ernst, christian, julius, schering, 1824, 97, function, theory, wilhelm, eduard, weber, 1804, 91, physical, studies, applied, physics, eduard, riecke, 1845, 1915, theory, of, electricity, and, hermann, lotze, 1817, 81, philosophy, of, religion, many, of, the, philosophical, doctrines, of, the, mature, frege, have, parallels, in, lotze, it, has, been, the, subject, of, scholarly, debate, whether, or, not, there, was, a, direct, influence, on, frege, s, views, arising, from, his, attending, lotze, s, lectures, in, 1873, frege, attained, his, doctorate, under, ernst, christian, julius, schering, with, a, dissertation, under, the, title, of, ueber, eine, geometrische, darstellung, der, imagin, ren, gebilde, in, der, ebene, on, a, geometrical, representation, of, imaginary, forms, in, a, plane, in, which, he, aimed, to, solve, such, fundamental, problems, in, geometry, as, the, mathematical, interpretation, of, projective, geometry, s, infinitely, distant, imaginary, points, frege, married, margarete, katharina, sophia, anna, lieseberg, 15, february, 1856, 25, june, 1904, on, 14, march, 1887, the, couple, had, at, least, two, children, who, unfortunately, died, when, young, years, later, they, adopted, a, son, alfred, little, else, is, known, about, frege, s, family, life, however, though, his, education, and, early, mathematical, work, focused, primarily, on, geometry, frege, s, work, soon, turned, to, logic, his, begriffsschrift, eine, der, arithmetischen, nachgebildete, formelsprache, des, reinen, denkens, halle, a, s, verlag, von, louis, nebert, 1879, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, logic, the, begriffsschrift, broke, new, ground, including, a, rigorous, treatment, of, the, ideas, of, functions, and, variables, frege, s, goal, was, to, show, that, mathematics, grows, out, of, logic, and, in, so, doing, he, devised, techniques, that, separated, him, from, the, aristotelian, syllogistic, but, took, him, rather, close, to, stoic, propositional, logic, in, effect, frege, invented, axiomatic, predicate, logic, in, large, part, thanks, to, his, invention, of, quantified, variables, which, eventually, became, ubiquitous, in, mathematics, and, logic, and, which, solved, the, problem, of, multiple, generality, previous, logic, had, dealt, with, the, logical, constants, and, or, if, then, not, and, some, and, all, but, iterations, of, these, operations, especially, some, and, all, were, little, understood, even, the, distinction, between, a, sentence, like, every, boy, loves, some, girl, and, some, girl, is, loved, by, every, boy, could, be, represented, only, very, artificially, whereas, frege, s, formalism, had, no, difficulty, expressing, the, different, readings, of, every, boy, loves, some, girl, who, loves, some, boy, who, loves, some, girl, and, similar, sentences, in, complete, parallel, with, his, treatment, of, say, every, boy, is, foolish, a, frequently, noted, example, is, that, aristotle, s, logic, is, unable, to, represent, mathematical, statements, like, euclid, s, theorem, a, fundamental, statement, of, number, theory, that, there, are, an, infinite, number, of, prime, numbers, frege, s, conceptual, notation, however, can, represent, such, inferences, the, analysis, of, logical, concepts, and, the, machinery, of, formalization, that, is, essential, to, principia, mathematica, 3, vols, 1910, 13, by, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, and, alfred, north, whitehead, 1861, 1947, to, russell, s, theory, of, descriptions, to, kurt, g, del, s, 1906, 78, incompleteness, theorems, and, to, alfred, tarski, s, 1901, 83, theory, of, truth, is, ultimately, due, to, frege, one, of, frege, s, stated, purposes, was, to, isolate, genuinely, logical, principles, of, inference, so, that, in, the, proper, representation, of, mathematical, proof, one, would, at, no, point, appeal, to, intuition, if, there, was, an, intuitive, element, it, was, to, be, isolated, and, represented, separately, as, an, axiom, from, there, on, the, proof, was, to, be, purely, logical, and, without, gaps, having, exhibited, this, possibility, frege, s, larger, purpose, was, to, defend, the, view, that, arithmetic, is, a, branch, of, logic, a, view, known, as, logicism, unlike, geometry, arithmetic, was, to, be, shown, to, have, no, basis, in, intuition, and, no, need, for, non, logical, axioms, already, in, the, 1879, begriffsschrift, important, preliminary, theorems, for, example, a, generalized, form, of, law, of, trichotomy, were, derived, within, what, frege, understood, to, be, pure, logic, this, idea, was, formulated, in, non, symbolic, terms, in, his, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, die, grundlagen, der, arithmetik, 1884, later, in, his, basic, laws, of, arithmetic, grundgesetze, der, arithmetik, vol, 1, 1893, vol, 2, 1903, vol, 2, was, published, at, his, own, expense, frege, attempted, to, derive, by, use, of, his, symbolism, all, of, the, laws, of, arithmetic, from, axioms, he, asserted, as, logical, most, of, these, axioms, were, carried, over, from, his, begriffsschrift, though, not, without, some, significant, changes, the, one, truly, new, principle, was, one, he, called, the, basic, law, v, the, value, range, of, the, function, f, x, is, the, same, as, the, value, range, of, the, function, g, x, if, and, only, if, x, the, crucial, case, of, the, law, may, be, formulated, in, modern, notation, as, follows, let, x, fx, denote, the, extension, of, the, predicate, fx, that, is, the, set, of, all, fs, and, similarly, for, gx, then, basic, law, v, says, that, the, predicates, fx, and, gx, have, the, same, extension, if, and, only, if, x, the, set, of, fs, is, the, same, as, the, set, of, gs, just, in, case, every, f, is, a, g, and, every, g, is, an, f, the, case, is, special, because, what, is, here, being, called, the, extension, of, a, predicate, or, a, set, is, only, one, type, of, value, range, of, a, function, in, a, famous, episode, bertrand, russell, wrote, to, frege, just, as, vol, 2, of, the, grundgesetze, was, about, to, go, to, press, in, 1903, showing, that, russell, s, paradox, could, be, derived, from, frege, s, basic, law, v, it, is, easy, to, define, the, relation, of, membership, of, a, set, or, extension, in, frege, s, system, russell, then, drew, attention, to, the, set, of, things, x, that, are, such, that, x, is, not, a, member, of, x, the, system, of, the, grundgesetze, entails, that, the, set, thus, characterised, both, is, and, is, not, a, member, of, itself, and, is, thus, inconsistent, frege, wrote, a, hasty, last, minute, appendix, to, vol, 2, deriving, the, contradiction, and, proposing, to, eliminate, it, by, modifying, basic, law, v, frege, opened, the, appendix, with, the, exceptionally, honest, comment, hardly, anything, more, unfortunate, can, befall, a, scientific, writer, than, to, have, one, of, the, foundations, of, his, edifice, shaken, after, the, work, is, finished, this, was, the, position, i, was, placed, in, by, a, letter, of, mr, bertrand, russell, just, when, the, printing, of, this, volume, was, nearing, its, completion, this, letter, and, frege, s, reply, are, translated, in, jean, van, heijenoort, 1967, frege, s, proposed, remedy, was, subsequently, shown, to, imply, that, there, is, but, one, object, in, the, universe, of, discourse, and, hence, is, worthless, indeed, this, would, make, for, a, contradiction, in, frege, s, system, if, he, had, axiomatized, the, idea, fundamental, to, his, discussion, that, the, true, and, the, false, are, distinct, objects, see, for, example, dummett, 1973, but, recent, work, has, shown, that, much, of, the, program, of, the, grundgesetze, might, be, salvaged, in, other, ways, frege, s, work, in, logic, had, little, international, attention, until, 1903, when, russell, wrote, an, appendix, to, the, principles, of, mathematics, stating, his, differences, with, frege, the, diagrammatic, notation, that, frege, used, had, no, antecedents, and, has, had, no, imitators, since, moreover, until, russell, and, whitehead, s, principia, mathematica, 3, vols, appeared, in, 1910, 13, the, dominant, approach, to, mathematical, logic, was, still, that, of, george, boole, 1815, 64, and, his, intellectual, descendants, especially, ernst, schr, der, 1841, 1902, frege, s, logical, ideas, nevertheless, spread, through, the, writings, of, his, student, rudolf, carnap, 1891, 1970, and, other, admirers, particularly, bertrand, russell, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, 1889, 1951, frege, is, one, of, the, founders, of, analytic, philosophy, whose, work, on, logic, and, language, gave, rise, to, the, linguistic, turn, in, philosophy, his, contributions, to, the, philosophy, of, language, include, as, a, philosopher, of, mathematics, frege, attacked, the, psychologistic, appeal, to, mental, explanations, of, the, content, of, judgment, of, the, meaning, of, sentences, his, original, purpose, was, very, far, from, answering, general, questions, about, meaning, instead, he, devised, his, logic, to, explore, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, undertaking, to, answer, questions, such, as, what, is, a, number, or, what, objects, do, number, words, one, two, etc, refer, to, but, in, pursuing, these, matters, he, eventually, found, himself, analysing, and, explaining, what, meaning, is, and, thus, came, to, several, conclusions, that, proved, highly, consequential, for, the, subsequent, course, of, analytic, philosophy, and, the, philosophy, of, language, frege, s, 1892, paper, on, sense, and, reference, ber, sinn, und, bedeutung, introduced, his, influential, distinction, between, sense, sinn, and, reference, bedeutung, which, has, also, been, translated, as, meaning, or, denotation, while, conventional, accounts, of, meaning, took, expressions, to, have, just, one, feature, reference, frege, introduced, the, view, that, expressions, have, two, different, aspects, of, significance, their, sense, and, their, reference, reference, or, bedeutung, applied, to, proper, names, where, a, given, expression, say, the, expression, tom, simply, refers, to, the, entity, bearing, the, name, the, person, named, tom, frege, also, held, that, propositions, had, a, referential, relationship, with, their, truth, value, in, other, words, a, statement, refers, to, the, truth, value, it, takes, by, contrast, the, sense, or, sinn, associated, with, a, complete, sentence, is, the, thought, it, expresses, the, sense, of, an, expression, is, said, to, be, the, mode, of, presentation, of, the, item, referred, to, and, there, can, be, multiple, modes, of, representation, for, the, same, referent, the, distinction, can, be, illustrated, thus, in, their, ordinary, uses, the, name, charles, philip, arthur, george, mountbatten, windsor, which, for, logical, purposes, is, an, unanalysable, whole, and, the, functional, expression, the, king, of, the, united, kingdom, which, contains, the, significant, parts, the, king, of, and, united, kingdom, have, the, same, referent, namely, the, person, best, known, as, king, charles, iii, but, the, sense, of, the, word, united, kingdom, is, a, part, of, the, sense, of, the, latter, expression, but, no, part, of, the, sense, of, the, full, name, of, king, charles, these, distinctions, were, disputed, by, bertrand, russell, especially, in, his, paper, on, denoting, the, controversy, has, continued, into, the, present, fueled, especially, by, saul, kripke, s, famous, lectures, naming, and, necessity, frege, s, published, philosophical, writings, were, of, a, very, technical, nature, and, divorced, from, practical, issues, so, much, so, that, frege, scholar, dummett, expressed, his, shock, to, discover, while, reading, frege, s, diary, that, his, hero, was, an, anti, semite, after, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 19, his, political, opinions, became, more, radical, in, the, last, year, of, his, life, at, the, age, of, 76, his, diary, contained, political, opinions, opposing, the, parliamentary, system, democrats, liberals, catholics, the, french, and, jews, who, he, thought, ought, to, be, deprived, of, political, rights, and, preferably, expelled, from, germany, frege, confided, that, he, had, once, thought, of, himself, as, a, liberal, and, was, an, admirer, of, bismarck, but, then, sympathized, with, general, ludendorff, in, an, entry, dated, 5, may, 1924, frege, expressed, agreement, with, an, article, published, in, houston, stewart, chamberlain, s, deutschlands, erneuerung, which, praised, adolf, hitler, frege, recorded, the, belief, that, it, would, be, best, if, the, jews, of, germany, would, get, lost, or, better, would, like, to, disappear, from, germany, some, interpretations, have, been, written, about, that, time, the, diary, contains, a, critique, of, universal, suffrage, and, socialism, frege, had, friendly, relations, with, jews, in, real, life, among, his, students, was, gershom, scholem, who, greatly, valued, his, teaching, and, it, was, he, who, encouraged, ludwig, wittgenstein, to, leave, for, england, in, order, to, study, with, bertrand, russell, the, 1924, diary, was, published, posthumously, in, 1994, frege, was, described, by, his, students, as, a, highly, introverted, person, seldom, entering, into, dialogues, with, others, and, mostly, facing, the, blackboard, while, lecturing, he, was, however, known, to, occasionally, show, wit, and, even, bitter, sarcasm, during, his, classes, begriffsschrift, eine, der, arithmetischen, nachgebildete, formelsprache, des, reinen, denkens, 1879,
