https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi_brothers
the, gracchi, brothers, were, two, brothers, who, lived, during, the, beginning, of, the, late, roman, republic, tiberius, gracchus, and, gaius, gracchus, they, served, in, the, plebeian, tribunates, of, 133, bc, and, 122, 121, bc, respectively, they, have, been, received, as, well, born, and, eloquent, advocates, for, social, reform, who, were, both, killed, by, a, reactionary, political, system, their, terms, in, the, tribunate, precipitated, a, series, of, domestic, crises, which, are, viewed, as, unsettling, the, roman, republic, and, contributing, to, its, collapse, tiberius, gracchus, passed, legislation, which, established, a, commission, to, survey, roman, public, land, reassert, state, claims, to, it, and, redistribute, it, to, poor, rural, farmers, these, reforms, were, a, reaction, to, a, perceived, decline, in, italy, s, rural, population, a, decade, later, gaius, gracchus, reforms, among, other, things, attempted, to, buttress, tiberius, land, commission, and, start, roman, colonisation, outside, of, italy, they, also, were, far, more, broad, touching, on, many, topics, such, as, assignment, of, provincial, commands, composition, of, juries, for, the, permanent, courts, and, letting, of, state, tax, farming, contracts, both, brothers, were, killed, during, or, shortly, after, the, conclusion, of, their, respective, tribunician, terms, more, recent, scholarship, on, the, roman, economy, has, viewed, the, gracchi, agrarian, reforms, as, less, impactful, than, claimed, in, the, ancient, sources, it, is, also, clear, that, the, vast, majority, of, their, reformist, legislation, was, left, intact, rather, than, repealed, some, modern, scholars, also, connect, the, agrarian, reforms, to, degrading, rome, s, relations, with, its, italian, allies, and, the, social, war, as, the, reforms, were, a, reassertion, of, roman, claims, on, public, land, that, had, been, for, decades, largely, occupied, without, title, by, rome, s, italian, allies, gracchan, claims, of, italian, rural, depopulation, also, are, contradicted, by, archaeological, evidence, the, impact, of, the, violent, reaction, to, the, two, brothers, however, is, of, substantial, import, it, set, a, dangerous, precedent, that, violence, was, an, acceptable, tool, against, political, enemies, the, gracchi, exerted, a, substantial, influence, on, later, politics, they, were, viewed, alternately, as, popular, martyrs, or, dangerous, demagogues, through, the, late, republic, they, were, also, portrayed, as, social, revolutionaries, and, proto, socialists, during, the, french, revolution, and, afterwards, in, that, vein, they, motivated, social, revolutionaries, such, as, fran, ois, no, l, gracchus, babeuf, and, opposition, to, enclosure, in, britain, scholars, today, view, these, socialist, comparisons, as, unapt, it, used, to, be, standard, view, that, through, the, second, century, bc, the, number, of, free, farmers, in, rural, italy, suffered, a, precipitous, decline, this, traditional, view, transmitted, from, the, ancient, sources, has, been, much, overstated, the, narrative, connecting, military, service, to, the, decline, of, the, yeomanry, moreover, has, to, be, rejected, the, main, driver, for, this, reevaluation, is, archaeological, evidence, of, italian, settlement, patterns, from, the, 1980s, onwards, impressive, methodological, advances, that, have, been, achieved, in, survey, archaeology, have, done, much, to, undermine, the, credibility, of, earlier, claims, concerning, the, spread, of, slave, staffed, estates, and, the, survival, or, otherwise, of, subsistence, oriented, smallholders, through, the, second, century, there, is, documented, some, difficulty, in, raising, men, and, some, resistance, against, levies, this, starts, in, the, third, macedonian, war, and, continues, through, roman, campaigns, in, spain, from, 151, bc, roman, censuses, which, were, conducted, largely, to, tally, men, for, conscription, starting, in, 159, bc, also, began, to, note, a, reduction, in, the, free, population, of, italy, falling, from, 328, 316, in, 159, 58, bc, down, to, a, low, of, 317, 933, in, the, census, of, 136, 35, bc, politicians, reacted, to, these, constraints, by, securing, volunteers, for, service, the, reforms, of, the, gracchi, were, related, to, solving, this, problem, and, also, minimising, the, impacts, of, conscription, however, state, difficulties, in, raising, men, for, war, did, not, mean, that, there, were, actual, quantitative, reductions, in, the, populations, of, rural, italy, while, the, census, reported, a, reduction, in, the, republic, s, citizen, population, through, the, 130s, bc, these, population, reductions, were, not, at, the, time, connected, to, unwillingness, to, serve, in, rome, s, unpopular, campaigns, in, spain, because, the, easiest, way, to, dodge, the, draft, was, to, avoid, registration, by, the, censors, no, actual, decline, in, population, is, necessary, to, explain, censorial, reports, thereto, the, later, results, of, the, censuses, of, 125, 24, bc, and, 115, 14, bc, indicate, large, increases, which, are, incompatible, with, any, actual, decline, in, italian, rural, populations, archaeological, evidence, of, small, farms, attested, all, over, italy, in, the, second, century, and, the, general, need, for, free, labour, during, harvest, time, has, led, scholars, to, conclude, that, there, are, no, good, grounds, for, inferring, a, general, decline, of, the, small, independent, farmer, in, the, second, century, the, gracchan, narrative, of, rural, population, decline, through, 133, bc, long, since, shown, to, be, false, likely, emerged, not, from, a, general, and, actual, decline, in, rural, free, holding, but, rather, generalisation, from, a, local, decline, in, coastal, etruria, where, commercial, slave, plantations, were, dominant, and, while, gracchan, observations, of, rural, poverty, were, likely, true, this, however, was, not, a, result, of, slave, dominated, plantations, crowding, out, poor, farmers, but, overpopulation, under, malthusian, conditions, in, rural, areas, closer, to, rome, expanding, population, and, partible, inheritance, led, to, the, splitting, of, previously, modest, farms, into, plots, too, small, to, support, families, many, of, these, small, farms, were, not, economically, viable, coupled, with, the, high, price, of, land, near, rome, many, of, these, farmers, sold, their, lands, to, rich, men, and, engaged, instead, in, wage, labour, there, is, ample, evidence, to, show, that, the, temporary, labour, of, free, men, was, very, important, to, large, estates, especially, around, harvest, time, in, the, years, before, 133, bc, a, pause, in, construction, of, large, public, monuments, also, reduced, demand, for, urban, labour, triggering, a, prolonged, period, of, poor, labour, market, conditions, this, general, economic, downturn, was, likely, compounded, by, years, of, high, food, prices, due, to, the, ongoing, slave, revolt, in, sicily, an, island, from, which, substantial, amounts, of, grain, were, shipped, to, rome, through, the, conquests, of, italy, in, the, fourth, and, third, centuries, bc, the, roman, state, had, acquired, legal, rights, to, large, amounts, of, land, ceded, by, the, subjugated, italian, allies, their, former, lands, the, ager, publicus, were, not, heavily, exploited, by, the, roman, state, rather, the, land, had, been, regarded, as, a, sort, of, beneficium, to, the, allies, who, had, been, allowed, to, continue, to, work, the, land, which, had, been, confiscated, from, them, through, roman, conquests, the, italians, who, were, allied, to, rome, were, de, facto, confirmed, in, their, lands, and, also, gained, substantially, from, the, influx, of, booty, and, wealth, from, roman, conquest, the, traditional, narratives, in, the, ancient, sources, which, described, the, emergence, of, commercial, latifundia, enormous, slave, staffed, plantations, owned, by, the, elite, on, the, public, land, itself, is, also, largely, unattested, to, by, the, archaeological, evidence, in, this, period, moreover, evidence, indicates, that, the, ager, publicus, was, largely, located, outside, of, the, traditional, farmlands, close, to, rome, and, instead, located, in, non, roman, italy, closer, to, the, italian, allies, public, land, redistribution, was, therefore, necessarily, at, the, expense, of, the, allies, who, would, be, evicted, from, ancestral, lands, still, occupied, tiberius, sempronius, gracchus, was, born, c, 163, bc, his, younger, brother, gaius, was, born, c, 154, bc, they, were, the, sons, of, the, tiberius, sempronius, gracchus, who, had, been, consul, 177, and, 163, bc, as, well, as, censor, in, 169, bc, he, had, triumphed, twice, in, 178, and, 175, bc, their, mother, was, cornelia, the, daughter, of, the, renowned, general, scipio, africanus, the, hero, of, the, second, punic, war, their, sister, sempronia, also, was, the, wife, of, scipio, aemilianus, another, important, general, and, politician, later, roman, historians, painted, cornelia, as, an, archetypical, roman, matron, heavily, idealised, and, inevitably, quite, distance, from, the, historical, cornelia, which, may, be, a, product, of, her, son, gaius, own, political, presentation, tiberius, military, career, started, in, 147, bc, serving, as, a, legate, or, military, tribune, under, his, brother, in, law, scipio, aemilianus, during, his, campaign, to, take, carthage, during, the, third, punic, war, tiberius, along, with, gaius, fannius, was, among, the, first, to, scale, carthage, s, walls, serving, through, to, the, next, year, a, decade, later, in, 137, bc, he, was, quaestor, under, the, consul, gaius, hostilius, mancinus, in, hispania, citerior, the, campaign, was, part, of, the, numantine, war, and, was, unsuccessful, mancinus, and, his, army, lost, several, skirmishes, outside, the, city, before, a, confused, night, time, retreat, that, led, them, to, the, site, of, a, camp, from, a, former, consular, campaign, in, 153, bc, where, they, were, surrounded, tiberius, negotiated, a, treaty, of, surrender, aided, in, part, by, his, father, s, positive, reputation, built, during, a, praetorship, in, 179, 78, bc, tiberius, treaty, however, was, later, humiliatingly, rejected, by, the, senate, after, his, return, to, rome, various, reforms, had, been, attempted, in, the, years, prior, to, 133, bc, one, of, the, ones, that, was, successful, was, the, establishment, of, a, secret, ballot, in, 139, bc, by, the, tribune, aulus, gabinius, the, circumstances, of, the, reform, are, no, longer, known, it, was, probably, presented, as, an, expansion, of, public, liberty, and, a, check, against, corruption, no, longer, would, those, who, bribed, be, able, to, ensure, that, recipients, voted, as, instructed, legislation, extending, the, secret, ballot, was, passed, in, 137, the, lex, cassia, extending, the, secret, ballot, to, capital, cases, after, scipio, aemilianus, convinced, an, opposing, tribune, to, heed, the, people, and, withdraw, his, veto, the, introduction, of, secret, ballot, was, probably, one, of, the, necessary, conditions, for, the, later, gracchan, programme, since, it, insulated, the, popular, assemblies, from, elite, control, for, this, reason, the, historian, harriet, flower, in, the, 2010, book, roman, republics, demarcates, a, political, watershed, and, new, phase, of, the, roman, republic, at, 139, bc, shortly, before, gabinius, law, in, 140, bc, agrarian, reforms, were, proposed, by, the, consul, gaius, laelius, sapiens, but, he, withdrew, his, proposals, after, an, invasion, he, was, assigned, as, consul, to, lead, the, response, and, the, opposition, of, the, senate, earning, him, the, cognomen, sapiens, the, ancient, historians, especially, plutarch, viewed, the, gracchan, reforms, and, brothers, as, a, single, unit, modern, scholars, have, started, to, view, them, separately, and, in, their, own, political, contexts, views, on, gracchus, motives, differ, favourable, ancient, sources, attribute, his, reforms, to, spirited, advocacy, for, the, poor, less, favourable, ancient, sources, such, as, cicero, instead, attribute, his, actions, to, an, attempt, to, win, back, dignitas, and, standing, after, the, embarrassing, treaty, he, was, forced, to, negotiate, after, defeat, in, spain, it, cannot, be, doubted, that, even, if, he, was, a, true, believer, in, the, need, for, reform, tiberius, hoped, to, further, his, fame, and, political, standing, among, the, elite, the, main, goal, of, tiberius, agrarian, proposal, was, three, fold, the, purpose, of, the, reform, was, to, stimulate, population, growth, and, expand, the, number, of, people, who, would, meet, the, property, qualifications, for, service, in, the, roman, army, the, inclusion, of, the, limit, of, 500, jugera, was, for, the, purpose, of, painting, the, law, as, a, return, to, mos, maiorum, and, the, sextian, licinian, rogations, so, to, avoid, any, charges, of, novelty, whether, the, sextian, licinian, rogations, in, fact, had, such, a, clause, is, unclear, what, mattered, to, tiberius, and, his, allies, was, that, they, believed, it, did, land, distributed, was, likely, done, so, with, a, prohibition, on, alienation, and, a, vectigal, rent, alienation, was, prohibited, to, prevent, recipients, from, simply, reselling, the, land, the, vectigal, served, to, allow, the, land, to, revert, to, the, state, if, a, citizen, walked, away, from, the, allotment, reversion, would, then, allow, the, state, to, settle, someone, else, on, the, land, the, veteres, possessores, old, possessors, also, would, receive, security, of, tenure, over, their, lands, up, to, the, 500, or, 1, 000, jugera, limit, tiberius, was, supported, in, his, endeavour, by, likeminded, aristocrats, who, also, viewed, the, perceived, problem, of, rural, depopulation, seriously, among, those, in, support, of, the, proposal, were, the, consul, of, 133, bc, publius, mucius, scaevola, and, scaevola, s, brother, publius, licinius, crassus, dives, mucianus, he, may, have, been, put, up, to, pass, the, proposals, by, those, allied, statesmen, he, was, also, successful, in, rallying, large, numbers, of, rural, plebs, to, rome, to, vote, in, favour, of, the, plan, the, proposals, were, likely, not, appealing, to, the, urban, plebs, who, would, not, have, had, the, agricultural, skills, necessary, to, capitalise, on, the, programme, he, was, opposed, in, the, assembly, by, one, of, the, other, tribunes, marcus, octavius, there, were, largely, three, grounds, for, opposition, first, the, dispossession, would, harm, the, ruling, classes, of, both, rome, and, the, italian, allies, second, the, law, unfairly, dispossessed, people, who, had, put, money, into, the, improvement, of, the, land, third, that, dispossession, also, would, unsettle, dowries, pledged, against, the, land, and, inheritances, made, under, the, assumption, tenure, was, secure, when, the, vote, arrived, and, octavius, interposed, his, tribunician, veto, the, matter, was, brought, before, the, senate, but, no, settlement, was, reached, unwilling, to, back, down, tiberius, unprecedentedly, had, the, assembly, depose, octavius, from, office, and, vote, the, legislation, through, violent, opposition, to, tiberius, agrarian, policy, did, not, come, to, a, head, until, he, moved, legislation, to, use, the, inheritance, of, attalus, iii, of, pergamon, for, the, land, commission, the, ancient, sources, differ, on, the, question, of, what, attalus, bequest, was, to, be, dedicated, plutarch, claims, it, was, to, be, used, to, help, land, recipients, purchase, farm, equipment, livy, via, epitome, claims, that, it, was, to, be, used, to, purchase, more, land, for, distribution, after, there, turned, out, to, be, little, land, available, this, second, proposal, infringed, on, senatorial, prerogatives, over, foreign, policy, and, public, finances, senators, also, feared, that, these, financial, handouts, would, give, tiberius, substantial, personal, political, power, tiberius, then, announced, his, intention, to, stand, for, re, election, according, to, livy, this, was, illegal, due, to, a, law, which, forbade, holding, the, same, magistracy, within, ten, years, the, sources, allege, that, tiberius, also, announced, plans, for, a, significantly, more, broad, set, of, reforms, but, these, may, be, retrojections, of, his, brother, gaius, later, consummated, proposals, on, the, day, of, the, election, tiberius, seized, the, capitoline, hill, possibly, to, intimidate, the, voters, tiberius, opponents, accused, him, of, having, kingly, aspirations, and, attempted, to, induce, the, consul, in, the, senate, to, use, force, to, stop, his, re, election, the, consul, refused, to, act, extralegally, but, one, of, the, other, senators, publius, cornelius, scipio, nasica, serapio, found, this, reply, unacceptable, and, led, an, impromptu, military, levy, of, senators, which, included, one, of, tiberius, colleagues, in, the, plebeian, tribunate, with, nasica, who, was, pontifex, maximus, reenacting, an, archaic, sacrificial, ritual, they, then, stormed, the, capitoline, and, bludgeoned, tiberius, and, a, number, of, his, supporters, to, death, it, was, largely, constitutional, issues, which, impelled, the, violent, reaction, not, the, agrarian, laws, the, reaction, was, motivated, in, part, by, greek, constitutional, thought, which, created, a, narrative, of, popular, mobilisation, leading, inexorably, to, popular, tyranny, such, beliefs, were, compounded, by, the, recent, example, of, tyranny, in, sparta, led, by, nabis, which, had, come, to, power, with, a, reform, programme, of, cancelling, debts, and, redistributing, lands, tiberius, lex, agraria, and, the, commission, survived, his, death, opposition, was, to, tiberius, methods, rather, than, his, policies, it, is, likely, that, most, senators, agreed, with, the, reform, programme, in, principle, archaeologists, have, recovered, the, commission, s, boundary, stones, cippi, which, largely, name, the, three, commissioners, from, 133, 30, bc, the, boundary, locations, and, descriptions, imply, the, distribution, over, just, a, few, years, of, some, 3, 268, square, kilometres, of, land, to, roman, citizens, concentrated, in, southern, italy, and, benefitting, some, 15, 000, households, the, cippi, largely, name, tiberius, younger, brother, gaius, appius, claudius, pulcher, and, publius, licinius, crassus, tiberius, appointed, himself, to, the, commission, but, after, his, death, crassus, was, elected, in, his, place, after, the, natural, deaths, of, appius, claudius, and, crassus, by, 130, bc, marcus, fulvius, flaccus, and, gaius, papirius, carbo, were, elected, in, their, place, because, one, of, the, commission, s, goals, was, in, reasserting, roman, claims, to, land, which, by, that, time, had, long, been, occupied, by, the, italian, allies, the, allies, started, to, complain, of, unfairness, and, inaccurate, rushed, surveying, in, 129, those, complaints, were, heard, by, the, senate, who, also, took, the, opportunity, to, limit, the, agrarian, commission, s, powers, scipio, aemilianus, proposed, and, received, from, the, senate, a, decree, which, assigned, the, power, to, determine, contested, ownership, to, the, consuls, by, 129, bc, the, commission, had, over, some, three, years, already, distributed, all, the, available, uncontested, land, archaeological, finds, of, gracchan, cippi, largely, stop, after, 129, bc, discontent, among, the, italian, allies, had, grown, between, tiberius, land, commission, and, the, later, 120s, bc, one, of, the, land, commissioners, elected, in, the, early, 120s, bc, marcus, fulvius, flaccus, had, served, as, consul, in, 125, bc, and, according, to, appian, proposed, a, compromise, giving, the, allies, roman, citizenship, in, exchange, for, acquiescence, to, roman, reassertion, of, claims, to, the, ager, publicus, this, proposal, however, fell, through, when, flaccus, was, dispatched, to, war, in, transalpine, gaul, relations, with, the, allies, were, also, not, helped, by, the, revolt, and, destruction, of, the, latin, colony, of, fregellae, when, flaccus, proposals, were, withdrawn, gaius, positioned, himself, politically, as, the, inheritor, of, tiberius, popularity, and, political, programme, after, a, quaestorship, he, was, elected, fourth, in, the, tribunician, elections, of, 124, bc, after, his, election, he, cast, his, brother, s, death, as, a, failure, by, the, plebeians, to, maintain, their, tradition, of, defending, their, tribunes, unlike, his, brother, gaius, proposals, largely, did, not, relate, to, land, over, two, years, he, proposed, broad, legislation, touching, all, parts, of, roman, government, from, tax, collection, to, senatorial, provincial, assignments, during, his, first, tribunate, he, proposed, a, number, of, laws, first, he, proposed, legislation, to, bar, anyone, who, the, people, had, deposed, from, office, from, further, office, this, was, however, dropped, at, the, instigation, of, his, mother, cornelia, the, proposal, was, likely, meant, to, intimidate, the, other, tribunes, so, they, would, not, exercise, their, vetoes, he, then, passed, legislation, reaffirming, provocatio, rights, and, retroactively, extending, them, to, the, sentences, of, exile, which, the, consular, commission, in, 132, bc, had, passed, against, tiberius, supporters, publius, popillius, laenas, the, consul, who, had, led, the, commission, and, was, thereby, opened, to, prosecution, for, violating, those, rights, immediately, left, the, city, for, exile, in, campania, gaius, also, moved, legislation, which, would, benefit, the, rich, equestrians, especially, those, who, served, as, rome, s, public, contractors, the, publicani, gaius, also, recognised, the, weakness, of, tiberius, coalition, which, relied, only, on, the, rural, plebs, and, therefore, sought, to, expand, it, to, do, so, he, courted, the, urban, plebs, with, legislation, establishing, roman, colonies, both, in, italy, and, abroad, at, carthage, he, also, carried, legislation, to, stop, deduction, of, soldier, pay, for, equipment, and, to, establish, a, minimum, age, for, conscription, at, 17, in, this, package, gaius, also, introduced, the, grain, subsidy, which, allowed, all, citizens, to, purchase, grain, at, a, subsidised, price, of, six, and, two, thirds, sesterces, per, modius, further, legislation, also, regulated, the, magistrates, and, the, senate, even, though, the, ancient, sources, generally, cast, these, reforms, as, part, of, an, elaborate, plot, against, the, authority, of, the, senate, he, showed, no, sign, of, wanting, to, replace, the, senate, in, its, normal, functions, nor, were, his, reforms, meant, to, undermine, the, senate, indirectly, or, establish, a, democracy, rather, gaius, was, seeking, to, have, the, senators, act, more, in, the, public, interest, rather, than, in, their, own, private, interests, to, that, end, with, an, ally, in, the, tribunate, manlius, acilius, glabrio, he, also, moved, legislation, reforming, the, provincial, corruption, laws, also, importantly, he, passed, the, lex, sempronia, de, provinciis, consularibus, which, required, the, senate, to, assign, consular, provinces, prior, to, the, elections, of, the, consuls, and, insulated, this, decision, from, tribunician, veto, some, ancient, sources, claim, that, gaius, wanted, to, change, voting, procedures, in, the, timocratic, comitia, centuriata, to, make, it, more, democratic, however, this, claim, is, dubious, and, largely, rejected, gaius, made, an, extremely, controversial, proposal, to, improve, the, state, of, the, latins, and, the, other, italian, allies, the, latins, would, receive, full, roman, citizenship, with, the, italians, upgraded, to, latin, rights, doing, so, further, extended, to, italians, via, latin, rights, the, right, to, vote, if, present, in, rome, during, elections, this, proposal, died, the, specifics, are, not, entirely, clear, it, may, have, been, vetoed, or, otherwise, simply, withdrawn, recent, scholarship, now, trends, towards, a, veto, from, livius, drusus, gaius, after, taking, some, leave, to, set, up, a, colony, near, carthage, attempted, to, stand, for, a, third, tribunate, but, was, unsuccessful, it, is, said, that, he, had, sufficient, popular, support, to, have, been, elected, but, was, not, returned, because, the, ten, tribunician, offices, had, already, been, filled, early, in, the, year, 121, bc, attempts, were, made, to, repeal, portions, of, gaius, legislation, the, main, point, of, repeal, however, was, not, agrarian, legislation, or, his, subsidised, grain, bill, but, the, comparatively, minor, question, of, the, proposed, colony, at, carthage, after, an, attendant, was, killed, in, the, streets, by, gaius, supporters, gaius, and, his, ally, flaccus, were, summoned, to, defend, themselves, before, the, senate, they, refused, and, barricaded, themselves, with, armed, followers, on, the, aventine, hill, their, refusal, was, tantamount, to, rebellion, a, senatus, consultum, ultimum, was, then, moved, instructing, the, consul, lucius, opimius, to, ensure, the, state, came, to, no, harm, and, urging, him, to, suppress, gaius, and, flaccus, on, the, aventine, with, a, force, of, militia, and, cretan, archers, opimius, stormed, the, aventine, killing, flaccus, and, his, sons, gaius, was, either, killed, or, forced,

archaeology, has, discovered, evidence, of, gracchan, land, colonial, activities, in, africa, c, 119, bc, and, the, land, commission, remained, in, operation, until, 111, bc, by, that, point, almost, all, land, available, to, distribute, had, already, been, distributed, in, the, whole, the, aristocracy, s, reaction, resembled, that, of, a, general, dealing, with, a, mutiny, who, accedes, to, most, of, the, demands, but, executes, the, ringleaders, to, preserve, discipline, tiberius, reforms, were, focused, on, the, rural, peasantry, they, were, not, however, so, much, oppressed, as, eager, quite, justifiably, to, share, in, the, increased, economic, prosperity, brought, by, roman, imperialism, in, general, more, recent, scholarship, has, stressed, that, the, ancient, sources, have, exaggerated, the, extent, to, which, the, roman, yeoman, farmers, were, in, fact, in, decline, tiberius, reform, law, was, not, revolutionary, but, his, tactics, in, pursuit, of, it, were, especially, when, they, mobilised, the, assemblies, which, gave, some, genuine, expression, of, the, popular, will, those, tactics, threatened, to, break, the, oligarchic, stranglehold, on, rome, s, political, system, thus, leading, to, his, demise, this, was, exacerbated, by, tiberius, use, of, social, justice, rhetoric, which, further, set, him, aside, from, his, aristocratic, brethren, while, substantial, acreage, was, distributed, as, a, whole, more, than, 3, 268, square, kilometres, in, the, first, few, years, of, operation, there, is, some, debate, to, the, extent, to, which, the, gracchan, land, allotments, were, actually, economically, viable, for, the, families, placed, atop, them, however, there, are, some, indications, that, the, lands, distributed, were, used, for, pasture, rather, than, intensive, agriculture, even, if, they, were, suitable, for, farming, gaius, role, in, land, reform, is, more, obscure, the, sources, are, largely, unclear, on, it, except, in, mentioning, offhandedly, that, he, brought, legislation, on, the, matter, by, the, time, of, his, tribunate, the, census, results, of, 125, 24, bc, had, been, published, and, belief, in, a, depopulation, crisis, had, disappeared, his, agrarian, reforms, likely, did, little, more, than, grant, the, agrarian, commission, of, which, he, was, still, a, member, the, necessary, jurisdiction, stripped, in, 129, bc, he, was, however, sufficiently, visionary, to, see, that, further, land, exactions, from, rome, s, allies, would, seriously, damage, their, interests, and, be, politically, infeasible, this, led, him, one, of, the, first, to, realise, that, the, amount, of, land, in, italy, was, insufficient, to, provide, for, all, inhabitants, of, the, peninsula, to, pursue, extra, italian, colonisation, this, change, in, scope, proved, long, lasting, and, by, the, time, of, caesar, it, would, be, standard, policy, to, establish, citizen, colonies, outside, the, italian, peninsula, which, would, in, time, prove, the, only, adequate, method, of, finding, enough, land, for, italy, s, growing, populations, the, gracchan, leges, agrariae, continued, in, operation, through, their, deaths, until, 111, bc, which, again, overhauled, roman, policy, with, public, lands, much, of, this, law, survives, to, the, present, building, upon, those, laws, it, abolished, the, rents, that, tiberius, law, passed, making, the, lands, fully, private, and, alienable, by, 111, bc, most, of, the, lands, that, could, be, distributed, already, had, been, what, was, left, over, was, mostly, pasture, or, land, which, had, been, assigned, to, specific, people, through, long, term, leases, or, set, aside, for, the, purpose, of, providing, money, for, road, maintenance, the, continuing, increase, of, the, italian, population, however, would, trigger, later, proposals, for, land, redistribution, especially, notable, is, caesar, s, lex, agraria, during, his, consulship, in, 59, bc, which, gave, away, the, ager, campanus, to, some, 20, 000, settlers, albeit, on, less, generous, terms, after, this, it, became, increasingly, clear, that, there, was, simply, insufficient, land, in, italy, to, accommodate, demand, reassessments, of, the, causes, of, the, social, war, have, also, trended, toward, viewing, the, lex, agraria, as, a, major, contributing, factor, land, holdings, in, roman, dominated, italy, gave, the, roman, state, a, latent, title, to, large, swaths, of, land, which, had, never, been, formally, surveyed, while, the, gracchan, land, commission, quickly, parcelled, and, redistributed, lands, in, southern, italy, that, had, been, confiscated, from, the, allies, that, had, defected, to, hannibal, during, the, second, punic, war, the, older, lands, had, been, occupied, for, centuries, attempts, through, to, the, start, of, the, social, war, to, press, roman, claims, on, those, lands, which, the, allies, assumed, that, they, would, be, able, to, keep, as, long, as, they, did, not, rebel, may, have, greatly, undermined, allied, support, for, roman, hegemony, gaius, reforms, were, broad, and, covered, large, portions, of, the, republic, s, administration, their, main, purpose, was, to, advance, the, quality, of, roman, government, reducing, extortion, and, corruption, among, the, senatorial, governors, while, acting, within, the, bounds, of, what, his, contemporaries, would, have, considered, due, process, one, of, the, elements, best, attested, to, is, gaius, lex, repetundarum, which, reformed, the, quaestio, perpetua, on, provincial, corruption, with, an, equestrian, jury, to, check, senatorial, governors, the, law, is, preserved, on, a, bronze, tablet, once, owned, by, cardinal, pietro, bembo, while, in, the, long, run, the, equestrian, jury, would, prove, a, political, issue, for, the, next, half, century, these, reforms, were, not, meant, to, set, the, senate, and, equites, into, conflict, nor, were, they, some, kind, of, programme, at, true, popular, oversight, as, moving, the, jury, from, the, senators, to, the, equites, merely, reallocated, influence, from, one, section, of, the, elite, to, another, ernst, badian, writing, in, the, oxford, classical, dictionary, gave, the, assessment, a, proud, aristocrat, wanted, to, leave, the, senate, in, charge, of, directing, policy, and, the, magistrates, in, charge, of, its, execution, subject, to, constitutional, checks, and, removed, from, financial, temptation, with, the, people, sharing, in, the, profits, of, empire, without, excessive, exploitation, of, the, subjects, the, ultimate, result, of, his, legislation, was, to, set, up, the, publicani, as, a, new, exploiting, class, not, restrained, by, a, tradition, of, service, or, by, accountability, at, law, but, this, did, not, become, clear, for, a, generation, and, he, cannot, be, blamed, for, not, foreseeing, it, his, lex, frumentaria, which, created, a, subsidised, grain, supply, at, around, what, he, considered, to, be, a, normal, price, set, up, an, influential, model, for, welfare, in, rome, it, was, a, reaction, to, corn, disruptions, in, recent, times, that, likely, developed, from, army, service, but, his, idea, to, have, the, roman, state, smooth, much, of, the, variability, of, agriculture, put, the, population, less, at, the, mercy, of, speculators, and, less, dependent, on, magisterial, largesse, the, lowered, incentives, for, magistrates, giving, food, away, for, popularity, at, home, had, the, added, effect, of, reducing, their, proclivity, to, extort, corn, from, provincials, these, provisions, continued, in, force, after, the, death, of, gaius, suggesting, an, emerging, consensus, at, rome, that, there, was, a, right, of, the, people, to, enjoy, the, rewards, of, the, empire, frumentationes, to, divert, the, interest, and, support, of, the, urban, plebs, from, the, prospect, of, agrarian, reform, after, a, period, of, abrogation, by, sulla, the, dole, in, the, future, would, expand, however, both, in, cost, and, generosity, as, later, generations, of, politicians, acted, with, or, without, senatorial, support, to, do, so, gaius, lex, de, provinciis, consularibus, was, a, similar, policy, to, reduce, senatorial, corruption, and, was, far, from, being, revolutionary, his, purpose, with, the, law, was, to, prevent, sitting, consuls, from, using, their, position, to, influence, provincial, assignments, improperly, and, perhaps, to, rome, s, detriment, by, requiring, provinces, to, be, assigned, before, the, consuls, took, office, to, further, insulate, such, decisions, from, political, meddling, he, even, made, senatorial, decisions, on, consular, provinces, immune, from, tribunician, veto, the, impact, of, tiberius, murder, started, a, cycle, of, increased, political, violence, the, oligarchy, had, introduced, violence, into, the, political, system, with, the, murder, of, tiberius, gracchus, and, over, the, years, the, use, of, violence, became, increasingly, acceptable, as, various, political, disputes, in, rome, led, to, more, and, more, bloody, discord, the, use, of, force, to, suppress, reform, also, suggested, that, the, republic, itself, was, temperamentally, unsuited, for, producing, the, types, of, economic, reforms, wanted, or, needed, as, in, the, gracchi, s, framing, by, the, people, in, terms, of, periodisation, the, death, of, tiberius, gracchus, in, 133, bc, is, widely, viewed, as, the, start, of, the, late, republic, and, the, beginning, of, the, republic, s, eventual, collapse, for, example, in, the, cambridge, companion, to, the, roman, republic, j, rgen, von, ungern, sternberg, writes, it, was, tiberius, assassination, that, made, the, year, 133, bc, a, turning, point, in, roman, history, and, the, beginning, of, the, crisis, of, the, roman, republic, even, in, ancient, times, cicero, remarked, as, much, in, saying, the, death, of, tiberius, gracchus, and, even, before, that, the, whole, rationale, behind, his, tribunate, divided, a, united, people, into, two, distinct, groups, however, scholars, such, as, mary, beard, also, warn, that, cicero, is, exaggerating, for, rhetorical, effect, and, that, the, idea, there, had, been, a, calm, consensus, at, rome, between, rich, and, poor, until, is, at, best, a, nostalgic, fiction, the, death, of, gaius, as, well, inaugurated, a, new, tool, for, the, senate, in, upholding, the, current, order, by, force, the, so, called, senatus, consultum, ultimum, opimius, was, prosecuted, in, 120, bc, for, violating, gaius, law, against, extralegal, punishment, the, ex, consul, however, was, able, to, successfully, defend, himself, by, appealing, to, the, senate, s, decree, and, by, arguing, that, gaius, and, flaccus, deserved, to, be, treated, as, seditious, enemies, rather, than, citizens, opimius, acquittal, set, the, precedent, that, the, senatus, consultum, ultimum, which, was, merely, advice, from, the, senate, the, senate, could, pass, any, decree, it, liked, it, was, the, magistrate, who, was, responsible, for, any, illegal, actions, was, an, acceptable, ground, to, vitiate, citizen, rights, extralegally, views, of, the, gracchi, have, changed, over, time, in, the, ancient, world, the, two, brothers, were, largely, viewed, as, an, organised, force, acting, in, concert, during, the, early, modern, period, the, gracchan, land, programme, was, widely, misconstrued, as, a, socialistic, restructuring, of, roman, society, where, public, and, private, land, ownership, would, be, capped, modern, historians, however, largely, view, the, two, brothers, political, activities, as, separate, and, dismiss, their, identification, as, social, revolutionaries, there, was, a, positive, and, a, negative, tradition, related, to, the, gracchi, brothers, many, of, the, ancient, sources, are, late, there, is, a, lack, of, contemporary, sources, and, are, coloured, by, the, positive, tradition, many, scholars, believe, that, plutarch, s, biographies, of, the, two, men, along, with, appian, s, civil, wars, are, largely, based, on, gaius, gracchus, and, his, supporters, narratives, in, this, most, of, what, is, known, of, tiberius, is, filtered, through, his, brother, s, self, presentation, plutarch, s, narrative, guided, by, his, literary, agenda, drastically, simplifies, the, history, of, this, period, on, the, whole, appian, s, narrative, is, more, reliable, but, is, still, marred, with, significant, anachronisms, clear, inaccuracies, and, schematic, features, that, the, agrarian, reform, eventually, fails, and, that, tiberius, and, gaius, pursued, the, same, objectives, which, emerge, from, appian, s, historiographical, agenda, some, modern, scholars, speculate, that, these, gracchan, narratives, were, transmitted, through, the, centuries, to, the, imperial, authors, by, plays, which, dramatised, the, tragedy, of, their, deaths, two, major, themes, stand, out, first, the, specifics, of, gaius, death, are, a, dog, s, breakfast, of, varying, details, and, involve, a, lucius, vitellius, which, was, a, common, name, during, the, republic, for, traitors, according, to, legend, the, vitellii, were, the, first, to, betray, the, republic, to, the, tarquins, shortly, after, the, expulsion, of, the, kings, second, the, stress, on, friendship, and, betrayal, in, these, last, hours, is, seen, as, replacing, a, more, anodyne, political, drama, for, heightened, pathos, other, scholars, however, disagree, arguing, that, the, hypothesis, of, lost, tragedies, is, too, speculative, and, instead, credit, plutarch, or, his, sources, with, the, dramatisation, of, the, narrative, regardless, in, later, generations, the, death, of, the, gracchi, became, a, common, rhetorical, topos, in, roman, oratorical, schools, the, negative, tradition, however, is, transmitted, through, other, sources, such, as, cicero, and, valerius, maximus, in, these, narratives, the, gracchi, are, painted, as, seditious, tribunes, who, inaugurated, the, use, of, force, and, intimidation, which, then, required, the, roman, state, to, use, violence, to, re, establish, order, the, confluence, of, these, traditions, was, common, in, late, republican, politics, for, example, cicero, modulated, his, opinions, on, the, gracchi, brothers, to, meet, his, audience, before, the, senate, he, spoke, of, them, negatively, and, focused, on, their, alleged, attempts, to, take, over, the, republic, before, the, people, he, instead, praised, their, good, faith, moral, virtues, and, quality, as, orators, especially, in, comparison, to, the, popularis, tribunes, of, his, day, by, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, many, books, on, ancient, history, repeated, a, false, notion, that, rome, had, limited, all, men, to, only, 500, jugera, of, land, the, incorrect, understanding, emerged, in, 1734, with, the, publication, of, montesquieu, s, considerations, on, the, causes, of, the, greatness, of, the, romans, and, their, decline, which, furthered, this, mistaken, notion, of, large, scale, land, reform, rather, than, redistribution, of, state, owned, lots, this, led, to, the, characterisation, of, the, gracchi, as, socialists, through, the, later, 18th, century, the, waters, became, further, muddied, until, the, matter, was, largely, re, cleared, by, barthold, georg, niebuhr, in, his, history, of, rome, during, the, french, revolution, the, revolutionary, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, named, himself, gracchus, after, the, gracchi, brothers, in, an, attempt, to, connect, his, desire, for, large, scale, land, redistribution, with, the, gracchan, programme, for, agrarian, reform, babeuf, s, plans, however, differed, substantially, from, the, gracchan, programme, in, ways, that, exemplify, how, the, reception, of, the, gracchi, had, deviated, from, their, actual, historical, policies, first, babeuf, envisioned, the, nationalisation, and, communal, ownership, of, lands, which, was, incompatible, with, the, gracchan, programme, of, privatising, already, state, owned, lands, second, babeuf, s, choice, of, name, was, made, under, the, prevailing, assumption, at, the, time, that, the, gracchi, acted, to, place, a, limit, on, private, land, holdings, finally, babeuf, s, name, demonstrated, his, belief, that, a, comparison, was, apt, consistent, with, contemporary, beliefs, that, the, gracchi, were, revolutionaries, however, the, truth, of, the, matter, was, otherwise, the, gracchi, sought, to, strengthen, and, uphold, the, roman, republic, babeuf, wished, to, overthrow, and, radicalise, the, french, republic, during, the, 19th, century, the, use, of, the, gracchi, in, then, current, politics, continued, the, process, of, enclosure, in, england, for, example, led, to, the, formation, of, a, large, body, of, poor, urban, workers, many, of, their, leaders, were, likened, to, the, gracchi, and, proposed, reforms, were, compared, with, reference, to, the, roman, land, crisis, as, described, in, the, ancient, sources, some, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, scholarship, argued, that, the, gracchi, were, to, some, extent, influenced, by, greek, political, philosophy, especially, in, the, extent, to, which, greek, democratic, principles, could, be, applied, at, rome, these, influences, are, largely, attributed, to, tiberius, interactions, with, stoic, egalitarian, philosophy, through, blossius, of, cumae, this, is, no, longer, believed, however, as, there, is, little, evidence, for, tiberius, being, a, stoic, or, for, stoicism, justfying, democratic, policies
