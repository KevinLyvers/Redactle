the, region, a, royal, charter, of, grant, issued, on, 18, october, 1409, contains, the, first, reference, to, john, hunyadi, in, the, document, king, sigismund, of, hungary, bestowed, hunyad, castle, in, present, day, hunedoara, romania, and, the, lands, attached, to, it, upon, john, s, father, voyk, and, voyk, s, four, kinsmen, including, john, himself, according, to, the, document, john, s, father, served, in, the, royal, household, as, a, court, knight, at, that, time, suggesting, that, he, was, descended, from, a, respected, family, two, 15th, century, chroniclers, johannes, de, thurocz, and, antonio, bonfini, write, that, voyk, had, moved, from, wallachia, to, hungary, upon, king, sigismund, s, initiative, l, szl, makkai, malcolm, hebron, p, l, engel, and, other, scholars, accept, the, two, chroniclers, report, of, the, wallachian, origin, of, john, hunyadi, s, father, in, contrast, with, them, ioan, aurel, pop, says, that, voyk, was, a, native, of, the, wider, region, of, hunyad, castle, antonio, bonfini, was, the, first, chronicler, to, have, made, a, passing, remark, of, an, alternative, story, of, john, hunyadi, s, parentage, soon, stating, that, it, was, just, a, tasteless, tale, fabricated, by, hunyadi, s, opponent, ulrich, ii, count, of, celje, according, to, this, anecdote, john, was, actually, not, voyk, s, child, but, king, sigismund, s, illegitimate, son, the, story, became, especially, popular, during, the, reign, of, john, hunyadi, s, son, matthias, corvinus, who, erected, a, statue, for, king, sigismund, in, buda, the, 16th, century, chronicler, g, sp, r, heltai, repeated, and, further, developed, the, tale, but, modern, scholars, for, instance, cartledge, and, kubinyi, regard, it, as, an, unverifiable, gossip, hunyadi, s, popularity, among, the, peoples, of, the, balkan, peninsula, give, rise, to, further, legends, of, his, royal, parentage, the, identification, of, john, hunyadi, s, mother, is, even, less, certain, in, connection, with, king, sigismund, s, supposed, parentage, both, bonfini, and, heltai, say, that, she, was, the, daughter, of, a, rich, boyar, or, nobleman, whose, estates, were, located, at, morzsina, present, day, margina, romania, pop, proposes, that, she, was, called, elisabeth, according, to, historian, l, szl, makkai, john, hunyadi, s, mother, was, a, member, of, the, muzsina, or, mu, ina, kenez, family, from, demsus, densu, romania, but, pop, refuses, the, identification, of, the, morzsina, and, muzsina, families, with, regard, of, john, hunyadi, s, mother, bonfini, provides, an, alternative, solution, as, well, stating, that, she, was, a, distinguished, greek, lady, but, does, not, name, her, according, to, kubinyi, her, alleged, greek, origin, may, simply, refer, to, her, orthodox, faith, in, a, letter, of, 1489, matthias, corvinus, wrote, that, his, grandmother, s, sister, whom, the, ottoman, turks, had, captured, and, forced, to, join, the, harem, of, an, unnamed, sultan, became, the, ancestor, of, cem, the, rebellious, son, of, sultan, mehmed, ii, based, on, this, letter, historian, kubinyi, says, that, the, greek, connection, cannot, be, discounted, entirely, if, matthias, corvinus, report, is, valid, john, hunyadi, the, hero, of, anti, ottoman, wars, and, the, ottoman, sultan, mehmed, ii, were, first, cousins, on, the, other, hand, historian, p, ter, e, kov, cs, writes, that, matthias, corvinus, s, story, about, his, family, connection, with, the, ottoman, sultans, was, nothing, but, a, pack, of, lies, hunyadi, s, year, of, birth, is, uncertain, although, g, sp, r, heltai, writes, that, hunyadi, was, born, in, 1390, he, must, have, actually, been, born, between, around, 1405, and, 1407, because, his, younger, brother, was, only, born, after, 1409, and, a, difference, of, almost, two, decades, between, the, two, brothers, age, is, not, plausible, the, place, of, his, birth, is, likewise, unknown, the, 16th, century, scholar, antun, vran, i, wrote, that, john, hunyadi, had, been, a, native, of, the, h, tszeg, region, now, ara, ha, egului, in, romania, hunyadi, s, father, died, before, 12, february, 1419, a, royal, charter, issued, on, this, day, mentions, hunyadi, hunyadi, s, two, brothers, john, the, younger, and, voyk, and, their, uncle, radol, but, does, not, refer, to, their, father, andreas, pannonius, who, served, hunyadi, for, five, years, wrote, that, the, future, commander, accustomed, himself, to, tolerate, both, cold, and, heat, in, good, time, like, other, young, noblemen, john, hunyadi, spent, his, youth, serving, in, the, court, of, powerful, magnates, however, the, exact, list, of, his, employers, cannot, be, completed, because, 15th, century, authors, recorded, contradictory, data, on, his, early, life, filippo, scolari, s, biographer, poggio, bracciolini, writes, that, scolari, who, was, responsible, for, the, defense, of, the, southern, frontier, as, isp, n, or, head, of, temes, county, educated, hunyadi, from, his, very, youth, suggesting, that, hunyadi, was, scolari, s, page, around, 1420, on, the, other, hand, john, of, capistrano, writes, in, a, letter, of, 1456, that, hunyadi, started, his, military, career, serving, under, nicholas, of, ilok, for, nicholas, of, ilok, was, at, least, six, year, younger, than, hunyadi, historian, p, l, engel, writes, that, capistrano, confused, him, with, his, brother, stephen, of, ilok, finally, antonio, bonfini, says, that, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, hunyadi, worked, either, for, demeter, csupor, bishop, of, zagreb, or, for, the, cs, kys, according, to, the, byzantine, historian, laonikos, chalkokondyles, the, young, hunyadi, stayed, for, a, time, at, the, court, of, stefan, lazarevi, despot, of, serbia, who, died, in, 1427, hunyadi, s, marriage, with, elisabeth, szil, gyi, substantiates, chalkokondyles, report, because, her, father, ladislaus, was, the, despot, s, familiaris, around, 1426, the,

he, joined, the, army, of, filippo, maria, visconti, duke, of, milan, bonfini, says, that, hunyadi, served, two, years, in, the, duke, s, army, modern, scholars, for, instance, cartledge, engel, mure, anu, and, teke, say, that, hunyadi, familiarized, himself, with, the, principles, of, contemporary, military, art, including, the, employment, of, mercenaries, in, milan, hunyadi, again, joined, the, entourage, of, sigismund, who, had, in, the, meantime, been, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, in, rome, at, the, very, end, of, 1433, he, served, the, monarch, as, a, court, knight, he, loaned, 1, 200,

maros, river, to, hunyadi, and, his, younger, brother, the, royal, charter, of, the, transaction, mentions, hunyadi, as, john, the, vlach, romanian, in, short, sigismund, granted, hunyadi, further, domains, including, b, k, sszentandr, s, and, h, dmez, v, s, rhely, each, incorporating, about, 10, villages, antonio, bonfini, writes, of, hunyadi, s, service, in, the, retinue, of, one, francis, csan, di, who, became, so, fond, of, him, that, treated, him, as, if, he, were, his, own, son, historian, engel, identifies, francis, csan, di, with, franko, talovac, croatian, nobleman, and, ban, of, severin, who, was, also, isp, n, of, csan, d, county, around, 1432, engel, says, that, hunyadi, served, in, the, ban, s, retinue, for, at, least, one, and, a, half, years, from, around, october, 1434,

december, it, is, without, doubt, that, hunyadi, installed, a, new, voivode, in, wallachia, but, modern, historians, debate, whether, the, new, voivode, was, vladislav, ii, to, whom, hunyadi, referred, as, his, relative, in, a, letter, or, dan, who, seems, to, have, been, a, son, of, basarab, ii, in, february, 1448, hunyadi, sent, an, army, to, moldavia, to, support, the, pretender, peter,
