other, s, zones, in, the, resulting, chaos, macarthur, was, taken, prisoner, by, men, of, the, 1st, division, who, mistook, him, for, a, german, general, this, would, be, soon, resolved, by, the, removal, of, his, hat, and, long, scarf, that, he, wore, his, performance, in, the, attack, on, the, meuse, heights, led, to, his, being, awarded, a, seventh, silver, star, on, 10, november, a, day, before, the, armistice, with, germany, that, ended, the, fighting, macarthur, was, appointed, commander, of, the, 42nd, division, upon, the, recommendation, of, its, outgoing, commander, menoher, who, had, left, to, take, over, the, newly, activated, vi, corps, for, his, service, as, the, 42nd, s, chief, of, staff, and, commander, of, the, 84th, infantry, brigade, he, was, later, awarded, the, army, distinguished, service, medal, his, period, in, command, of, the, 42nd, division, was, brief, for, on, 22, november, he, like, other, brigadier, generals, was, replaced, and, returned, to, the, 84th, infantry, brigade, with, major, general, clement, flagler, his, former, battalion, commander, from, fort, leavenworth, days, before, the, war, instead, taking, command, it, is, possible, that, he, may, have, retained, command, of, the, 42nd, had, he, been, promoted, to, major, general, making, him, the, youngest, in, the, u, s, army, but, with, the, sudden, cessation, of, hostilities, that, was, unlikely, general, peyton, c, march, the, army, chief, of, staff, and, close, friend, of, arthur, macarthur, had, put, a, block, on, promotions, there, would, be, no, more, stars, awarded, while, the, war, department, got, to, grips, with, demobilization, macarthur, returned, to, commanding, the, 84th, brigade, the, 42nd, division, was, chosen, to, participate, in, the, occupation, of, the, rhineland, occupying, the, ahrweiler, district, in, april, 1919, the, 42nd, division, entrained, for, brest, and, saint, nazaire, where, they, boarded, ships, to, return, to, the, united, states, macarthur, traveled, on, the, ocean, liner, ss, leviathan, which, reached, new, york, on, 25, april, 1919, shortly, after, the, return, home, macarthur, s, 84th, brigade, was, demobilized, at, camp, dodge, iowa, on, 12, may, 1919, the, following, month, he, became, superintendent, of, the, u, s, military, academy, at, west, point, which, general, march, an, acerbic, thin, lipped, intellectual, felt, had, become, out, of, date, in, many, respects, and, was, much, in, need, of, reform, accepting, the, post, one, of, the, most, prestigious, in, the, army, also, allowed, macarthur, to, retain, his, rank, of, brigadier, general, which, was, only, temporary, and, for, the, duration, of, the, war, instead, of, being, reduced, to, his, substantive, rank, of, major, like, many, of, his, contemporaries, when, macarthur, moved, into, the, superintendent, s, house, with, his, mother, he, became, the, youngest, superintendent, since, sylvanus, thayer, in, 1817, however, whereas, thayer, had, faced, opposition, from, outside, the, army, macarthur, had, to, overcome, resistance, from, graduates, and, the, academic, board, macarthur, s, vision, of, what, was, required, of, an, officer, came, not, just, from, his, recent, experience, of, combat, in, france, but, also, from, that, of, the, occupation, of, the, rhineland, in, germany, the, military, government, of, the, rhineland, had, required, the, army, to, deal, with, political, economic, and, social, problems, but, he, had, found, that, many, west, point, graduates, had, little, or, no, knowledge, of, fields, outside, of, the, military, sciences, during, the, war, west, point, had, been, reduced, to, little, more, than, an, officer, candidate, school, with, five, classes, being, graduated, in, two, years, cadet, and, staff, morale, was, low, and, hazing, at, an, all, time, peak, of, viciousness, macarthur, s, first, change, turned, out, to, be, the, easiest, congress, had, set, the, length, of, the, course, at, three, years, macarthur, was, able, to, get, the, four, year, course, restored, during, the, debate, over, the, length, of, the, course, the, new, york, times, brought, up, the, issue, of, the, cloistered, and, undemocratic, nature, of, student, life, at, west, point, also, starting, with, harvard, university, in, 1869, civilian, universities, had, begun, grading, students, on, academic, performance, alone, but, west, point, had, retained, the, old, whole, man, concept, of, education, macarthur, sought, to, modernize, the, system, expanding, the, concept, of, military, character, to, include, bearing, leadership, efficiency, and, athletic, performance, he, formalized, the, hitherto, unwritten, cadet, honor, code, in, 1922, when, he, formed, the, cadet, honor, committee, to, review, alleged, code, violations, elected, by, the, cadets, themselves, it, had, no, authority, to, punish, but, acted, as, a, kind, of, grand, jury, reporting, offenses, to, the, commandant, macarthur, attempted, to, end, hazing, by, using, officers, rather, than, upperclassmen, to, train, the, plebes, instead, of, the, traditional, summer, camp, at, fort, clinton, macarthur, had, the, cadets, trained, to, use, modern, weapons, by, regular, army, sergeants, at, fort, dix, they, then, marched, back, to, west, point, with, full, packs, he, attempted, to, modernize, the, curriculum, by, adding, liberal, arts, government, and, economics, courses, but, encountered, strong, resistance, from, the, academic, board, in, military, art, classes, the, study, of, the, campaigns, of, the, american, civil, war, was, replaced, with, the, study, of, those, of, world, war, i, in, history, class, more, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, far, east, macarthur, expanded, the, sports, program, increasing, the, number, of, intramural, sports, and, requiring, all, cadets, to, participate, he, allowed, upper, class, cadets, to, leave, the, reservation, and, sanctioned, a, cadet, newspaper, the, brag, forerunner, of, today, s, west, pointer, he, also, permitted, cadets, to, travel, to, watch, their, football, team, play, and, gave, them, a, monthly, allowance, of, 5, equivalent, to, 91, in, 2023, professors, and, alumni, alike, protested, these, radical, moves, most, of, macarthur, s, west, point, reforms, were, soon, discarded, but, in, the, ensuing, years, his, ideas, became, accepted, and, his, innovations, were, gradually, restored, macarthur, became, romantically, involved, with, socialite, and, multi, millionaire, heiress, louise, cromwell, brooks, they, were, married, at, her, family, s, villa, in, palm, beach, florida, on, 14, february, 1922, rumors, circulated, that, general, pershing, who, had, also, courted, louise, had, threatened, to, exile, them, to, the, philippines, if, they, were, married, pershing, denied, this, as, all, damn, poppycock, more, recently, richard, b, frank, has, written, that, pershing, and, brooks, had, already, severed, their, relationship, by, the, time, of, macarthur, s, transfer, brooks, was, however, informal, engaged, to, a, close, aide, of, pershing, s, she, broke, off, the, relationship, in, order, to, accept, macarthur, s, proposal, pershing, s, letter, concerning, macarthur, s, transfer, predated, by, a, few, days, brooks, s, and, macarthur, s, engagement, announcement, though, this, did, not, dispel, the, newspaper, gossip, in, october, 1922, macarthur, left, west, point, and, sailed, to, the, philippines, with, louise, and, her, two, children, walter, and, louise, to, assume, command, of, the, military, district, of, manila, macarthur, was, fond, of, the, children, and, spent, much, of, his, free, time, with, them, the, revolts, in, the, philippines, had, been, suppressed, the, islands, were, peaceful, now, and, in, the, wake, of, the, washington, naval, treaty, the, garrison, was, being, reduced, macarthur, s, friendships, with, filipinos, like, manuel, quezon, offended, some, people, the, old, idea, of, colonial, exploitation, he, later, conceded, still, had, its, vigorous, supporters, in, february, and, march, 1923, macarthur, returned, to, washington, to, see, his, mother, who, was, ill, from, a, heart, ailment, she, recovered, but, it, was, the, last, time, he, saw, his, brother, arthur, who, died, suddenly, from, appendicitis, in, december, 1923, in, june, 1923, macarthur, assumed, command, of, the, 23rd, infantry, brigade, of, the, philippine, division, on, 7, july, 1924, he, was, informed, that, a, mutiny, had, broken, out, amongst, the, philippine, scouts, over, grievances, concerning, pay, and, allowances, over, 200, were, arrested, and, there, were, fears, of, an, insurrection, macarthur, was, able, to, calm, the, situation, but, his, subsequent, efforts, to, improve, the, salaries, of, filipino, troops, were, frustrated, by, financial, stringency, and, racial, prejudice, on, 17, january, 1925, at, the, age, of, 44, he, was, promoted, becoming, the, army, s, youngest, major, general, returning, to, the, u, s, macarthur, took, command, of, the, iv, corps, area, based, at, fort, mcpherson, in, atlanta, georgia, on, 2, may, 1925, however, he, encountered, southern, prejudice, because, he, was, the, son, of, a, union, army, officer, and, requested, to, be, relieved, a, few, months, later, he, assumed, command, of, the, iii, corps, area, based, at, fort, mchenry, in, baltimore, maryland, which, allowed, macarthur, and, louise, to, move, to, her, rainbow, hill, estate, near, garrison, maryland, however, this, relocation, also, led, to, what, he, later, described, as, one, of, the, most, distasteful, orders, i, ever, received, a, direction, to, serve, on, the, court, martial, of, brigadier, general, billy, mitchell, macarthur, was, the, youngest, of, the, thirteen, judges, none, of, whom, had, aviation, experience, three, of, them, including, summerall, the, president, of, the, court, were, removed, when, defense, challenges, revealed, bias, against, mitchell, despite, macarthur, s, claim, that, he, had, voted, to, acquit, mitchell, was, found, guilty, as, charged, and, convicted, macarthur, felt, that, a, senior, officer, should, not, be, silenced, for, being, at, variance, with, his, superiors, in, rank, and, with, accepted, doctrine, in, 1927, macarthur, and, louise, separated, and, she, moved, to, new, york, city, adopting, as, her, residence, the, entire, twenty, sixth, floor, of, a, manhattan, hotel, in, august, that, year, william, c, prout, the, president, of, the, american, olympic, committee, died, suddenly, and, the, committee, elected, macarthur, as, their, new, president, his, main, task, was, to, prepare, the, u, s, team, for, the, 1928, summer, olympics, in, amsterdam, where, the, americans, won, the, most, medals, upon, returning, to, the, u, s, macarthur, received, orders, to, assume, command, of, the, philippine, department, this, time, the, general, travelled, alone, on, 17, june, 1929, while, he, was, in, manila, louise, obtained, a, divorce, ostensibly, on, the, grounds, of, failure, to, provide, in, view, of, louise, s, great, wealth, william, manchester, described, this, legal, fiction, as, preposterous, both, later, acknowledged, the, real, reason, to, be, incompatibility, by, 1930, macarthur, was, 50, and, still, the, youngest, and, one, of, the, best, known, of, the, u, s, army, s, major, generals, he, left, the, philippines, on, 19, september, 1930, and, for, a, brief, time, was, in, command, of, the, ix, corps, area, in, san, francisco, on, 21, november, he, was, sworn, in, as, chief, of, staff, of, the, united, states, army, with, the, rank, of, general, while, in, washington, he, would, ride, home, each, day, to, have, lunch, with, his, mother, at, his, desk, he, would, wear, a, japanese, ceremonial, kimono, cool, himself, with, an, oriental, fan, and, smoke, cigarettes, in, a, jeweled, cigarette, holder, in, the, evenings, he, liked, to, read, military, history, books, about, this, time, he, began, referring, to, himself, as, macarthur, he, had, already, hired, a, public, relations, staff, to, promote, his, image, with, the, american, public, together, with, a, set, of, ideas, he, was, known, to, favor, namely, a, belief, that, america, needed, a, strongman, leader, to, deal, with, the, possibility, that, communists, might, lead, all, of, the, great, masses, of, unemployed, into, a, revolution, that, america, s, destiny, was, in, the, asia, pacific, region, and, a, strong, hostility, to, the, british, empire, one, contemporary, described, macarthur, as, the, greatest, actor, to, ever, serve, as, a, u, s, army, general, while, another, wrote, that, macarthur, had, a, court, rather, than, a, staff, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, prompted, congress, to, make, cuts, in, the, army, s, personnel, and, budget, some, 53, bases, were, closed, but, macarthur, managed, to, prevent, attempts, to, reduce, the, number, of, regular, officers, from, 12, 000, to, 10, 000, macarthur, s, main, programs, included, the, development, of, new, mobilization, plans, he, grouped, the, nine, corps, areas, together, under, four, armies, which, were, charged, with, responsibility, for, training, and, frontier, defense, he, also, negotiated, the, macarthur, pratt, agreement, with, the, chief, of, naval, operations, admiral, william, v, pratt, this, was, the, first, of, a, series, of, inter, service, agreements, over, the, following, decades, that, defined, the, responsibilities, of, the, different, services, with, respect, to, aviation, this, agreement, placed, coastal, air, defense, under, the, army, in, march, 1935, macarthur, activated, a, centralized, air, command, general, headquarters, air, force, under, general, frank, m, andrews, by, rapidly, promoting, andrews, from, lieutenant, colonel, to, brigadier, general, macarthur, supported, andrews, endorsement, of, the, boeing, b, 17, flying, fortress, heavy, bomber, and, the, concept, of, long, range, four, engine, bombers, this, was, controversial, at, the, time, because, most, high, ranking, army, generals, and, officials, in, the, war, department, supported, twin, engine, bombers, like, the, douglas, b, 18, bolo, heavy, bomber, after, macarthur, left, his, position, as, army, chief, of, staff, in, october, 1935, his, successor, malin, craig, and, war, secretary, harry, hines, woodring, ordered, a, halt, to, research, and, development, of, the, b, 17, and, in, 1939, zero, four, engine, bombers, were, ordered, by, the, war, department, and, instead, hundreds, of, inferior, b, 18s, and, other, twin, engine, bombers, were, ordered, and, delivered, to, the, army, andrews, thanks, to, macarthur, putting, him, in, a, position, of, power, in, 1935, was, able, to, use, bureaucratic, loopholes, to, covertly, order, research, and, development, of, the, b, 17, to, the, point, that, when, the, army, and, president, roosevelt, finally, endorsed, four, engine, bombers, in, 1940, b, 17s, were, able, to, be, immediately, produced, with, no, delays, related, to, research, and, testing, the, development, of, the, m1, garand, rifle, also, happened, during, macarthur, s, tenure, as, chief, of, staff, there, was, a, debate, over, what, caliber, the, m1, garand, should, use, many, in, the, army, and, marine, corps, wanted, the, new, rifle, to, use, the, 276, pedersen, round, macarthur, personally, intervened, and, ordered, the, m1, garand, to, use, the, 30, 06, springfield, round, which, was, what, the, m1903, springfield, used, this, allowed, the, military, to, use, the, same, ammunition, for, both, the, old, standard, service, m1903, springfield, rifles, and, the, future, new, standard, service, m1, garand, the, m1, garand, chambered, in, 30, 06, springfield, was, cleared, for, service, in, november, 1935, and, officially, adopted, in, january, 1936, as, the, new, army, service, rifle, just, a, few, months, after, macarthur, finished, his, tour, of, duty, as, chief, of, staff, one, of, macarthur, s, most, controversial, acts, came, in, 1932, when, the, bonus, army, of, veterans, converged, on, washington, he, sent, tents, and, camp, equipment, to, the, demonstrators, along, with, mobile, kitchens, until, an, outburst, in, congress, caused, the, kitchens, to, be, withdrawn, macarthur, was, concerned, that, the, demonstration, had, been, taken, over, by, communists, and, pacifists, but, the, general, staff, s, intelligence, division, reported, that, only, three, of, the, march, s, 26, key, leaders, were, communists, macarthur, went, over, contingency, plans, for, civil, disorder, in, the, capital, mechanized, equipment, was, brought, to, fort, myer, where, anti, riot, training, was, conducted, on, 28, july, 1932, in, a, clash, with, the, district, police, two, veterans, were, shot, and, later, died, president, herbert, hoover, ordered, macarthur, to, surround, the, affected, area, and, clear, it, without, delay, macarthur, brought, up, troops, and, tanks, and, against, the, advice, of, major, dwight, d, eisenhower, decided, to, accompany, the, troops, although, he, was, not, in, charge, of, the, operation, the, troops, advanced, with, bayonets, and, sabers, drawn, under, a, shower, of, bricks, and, rocks, but, no, shots, were, fired, in, less, than, four, hours, they, cleared, the, bonus, army, s, campground, using, tear, gas, the, gas, canisters, started, a, number, of, fires, causing, the, only, death, during, the, riots, while, not, as, violent, as, other, anti, riot, operations, it, was, nevertheless, a, public, relations, disaster, however, the, defeat, of, the, bonus, army, while, unpopular, with, the, american, people, at, large, did, make, macarthur, into, the, hero, of, the, more, right, wing, elements, in, the, republican, party, who, believed, that, the, general, had, saved, america, from, a, communist, revolution, in, 1932, in, 1934, macarthur, sued, journalists, drew, pearson, and, robert, s, allen, for, defamation, after, they, described, his, treatment, of, the, bonus, marchers, as, unwarranted, unnecessary, insubordinate, harsh, and, brutal, also, accused, for, proposing, 19, gun, salutes, for, friends, macarthur, asked, for, 750, 000, equivalent, to, 13, 4, million, in, 2023, to, compensate, for, the, damage, to, his, reputation, the, journalists, threatened, to, call, isabel, rosario, cooper, as, a, witness, macarthur, had, met, isabel, a, eurasian, teenager, while, in, the, philippines, and, she, had, become, his, mistress, macarthur, was, forced, to, settle, out, of, court, secretly, paying, pearson, 15, 000, equivalent, to, 267, 000, in, 2023, in, the, 1932, presidential, election, herbert, hoover, was, defeated, by, franklin, d, roosevelt, macarthur, and, roosevelt, had, worked, together, before, world, war, i, and, had, remained, friends, despite, their, political, differences, macarthur, supported, the, new, deal, through, the, army, s, operation, of, the, civilian, conservation, corps, he, ensured, that, detailed, plans, were, drawn, up, for, its, employment, and, decentralized, its, administration, to, the, corps, areas, which, became, an, important, factor, in, the, program, s, success, macarthur, s, support, for, a, strong, military, and, his, public, criticism, of, pacifism, and, isolationism, made, him, unpopular, with, the, roosevelt, administration, perhaps, the, most, incendiary, exchange, between, roosevelt, and, macarthur, occurred, over, an, administration, proposal, to, cut, 51, of, the, army, s, budget, in, response, macarthur, lectured, roosevelt, that, when, we, lost, the, next, war, and, an, american, boy, lying, in, the, mud, with, an, enemy, bayonet, through, his, belly, and, an, enemy, foot, on, his, dying, throat, spat, out, his, last, curse, i, wanted, the, name, not, to, be, macarthur, but, roosevelt, in, response, roosevelt, yelled, you, must, not, talk, that, way, to, the, president, macarthur, offered, to, resign, but, roosevelt, refused, his, request, and, macarthur, then, staggered, out, of, the, white, house, and, vomited, on, the, front, steps, in, spite, of, such, exchanges, macarthur, was, extended, an, extra, year, as, chief, of, staff, and, ended, his, tour, in, october, 1935, for, his, service, as, chief, of, staff, he, was, awarded, a, second, distinguished, service, medal, he, was, retroactively, awarded, two, purple, hearts, for, his, world, war, i, service, a, decoration, that, he, authorized, in, 1932, based, loosely, on, the, defunct, military, badge, of, merit, macarthur, insisted, on, being, the, first, recipient, of, the, purple, heart, which, he, had, engraved, with, 1, when, the, commonwealth, of, the, philippines, achieved, semi, independent, status, in, 1935, president, of, the, philippines, manuel, quezon, asked, macarthur, to, supervise, the, creation, of, a, philippine, army, quezon, and, macarthur, had, been, personal, friends, since, the, latter, s, father, had, been, governor, general, of, the, philippines, 35, years, earlier, with, president, roosevelt, s, approval, macarthur, accepted, the, assignment, it, was, agreed, that, macarthur, would, receive, the, rank, of, field, marshal, with, its, salary, and, allowances, in, addition, to, his, major, general, s, salary, as, military, advisor, to, the, commonwealth, government, of, the, philippines, this, made, him, the, best, paid, soldier, in, the, world, it, would, be, his, fifth, tour, in, the, far, east, macarthur, sailed, from, san, francisco, on, the, ss, president, hoover, in, october, 1935, accompanied, by, his, mother, and, sister, in, law, he, brought, eisenhower, and, major, james, b, ord, along, as, his, assistants, another, passenger, on, the, president, hoover, was, jean, marie, faircloth, an, unmarried, 37, year, old, socialite, over, the, next, two, years, macarthur, and, faircloth, were, frequently, seen, together, his, mother, became, gravely, ill, during, the, voyage, and, died, in, manila, on, 3, december, 1935, president, quezon, officially, conferred, the, title, of, field, marshal, on, macarthur, in, a, ceremony, at, malaca, an, palace, on, 24, august, 1936, eisenhower, recalled, finding, the, ceremony, rather, fantastic, he, found, it, pompous, and, rather, ridiculous, to, be, the, field, marshal, of, a, virtually, nonexisting, army, eisenhower, learned, later, on, that, the, field, marshalship, had, not, been, as, he, had, assumed, quezon, s, idea, i, was, surprised, to, learn, from, him, that, he, had, not, initiated, the, idea, at, all, rather, quezon, said, that, macarthur, himself, came, up, with, the, high, sounding, title, a, persistent, myth, has, pervaded, the, biographical, literature, to, the, effect, that, macarthur, wore, a, specially, designed, sharkskin, uniform, at, the, 1936, ceremony, to, go, with, his, new, rank, of, philippine, field, marshal, richard, meixsel, has, debunked, this, story, in, fact, the, special, uniform, was, the, creation, of, a, poorly, informed, journalist, in, 1937, who, mistook, a, recently, introduced, u, s, army, white, dress, uniform, for, a, distinctive, field, marshal, s, attire, the, philippine, army, was, formed, from, conscription, training, was, conducted, by, a, regular, cadre, and, the, philippine, military, academy, was, created, along, the, lines, of, west, point, to, train, officers, macarthur, and, eisenhower, found, that, few, of, the, training, camps, had, been, constructed, and, the, first, group, of, 20, 000, trainees, did, not, report, until, early, 1937, equipment, and, weapons, were, more, or, less, obsolete, american, cast, offs, and, the, budget, was, completely, inadequate, macarthur, s, requests, for, equipment, fell, on, deaf, ears, although, macarthur, and, his, naval, adviser, lieutenant, colonel, sidney, l, huff, persuaded, the, navy, to, initiate, the, development, of, the, pt, boat, much, hope, was, placed, in, the, philippine, army, air, corps, but, the, first, squadron, was, not, organized, until, 1939, article, xix, of, the, 1922, washington, naval, treaty, banned, the, construction, of, new, fortifications, or, naval, bases, in, all, pacific, ocean, territories, and, colonies, of, the, five, signatories, from, 1923,

the, initial, american, plan, for, the, defense, of, the, philippines, called, for, the, main, body, of, the, troops, to, retreat, to, the, bataan, peninsula, in, manila, bay, to, hold, out, against, the, japanese, until, a, relief, force, could, arrive, macarthur, changed, this, plan, to, one, of, attempting, to, hold, all, of, luzon, and, using, b, 17, flying, fortresses, to, sink, japanese, ships, that, approached, the, islands, macarthur, persuaded, the, decision, makers, in, washington, that, his, plans, represented, the, best, deterrent, to, prevent, japan, from, choosing, war, and, of, winning, a, war, if, worse, came, to, worst, between, july, and, december, 1941, the, garrison, received, 8, 500, reinforcements, after, years, of, parsimony, much, equipment, was, shipped, by,

latest, jn, 25, naval, code, station, cast, sent, macarthur, its, entire, output, via, sutherland, the, only, officer, on, his, staff, authorized, to, see, it, at, 03, 30, local, time, on, 8, december, 1941, about, 09, 00, on, 7, december, in, hawaii, sutherland, learned, of, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, informed, macarthur, at, 05, 30, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, u, s, army, general, george, marshall, ordered, macarthur, to, execute, the, existing, war, plan, rainbow, five, this, plan, had, been, leaked, to, the, american, public, by, the, chicago, tribune, three, days, prior, and, the, following, day, germany, had, publicly, ridiculed, the, plan, macarthur, did, not, follow, marshall, s, order, on, three, occasions, the, commander, of, the, far, east, air, force, major, general, lewis, h, brereton, requested, permission, to, attack, japanese, bases, in, formosa, in, accordance, with, prewar, intentions, but, was, denied, by, sutherland, brereton, instead, ordered, his, aircraft, to, fly, defensive, patrol, patterns, looking, for, japanese, warships, not, until, 11, 00, did, brereton, speak, with, macarthur, and, obtained, permission, to, begin, rainbow, five, macarthur, later, denied, having, the, conversation, at, 12, 30, nine, hours, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, aircraft, of, japan, s, 11th, air, fleet, achieved, complete, tactical, surprise, when, they, attacked, clark, field, and, the, nearby, fighter, base, at, iba, field, and, destroyed, or, disabled, 18, of, far, east, air, force, s, 35, b, 17s, caught, on, the,

and, 150, wounded, what, was, left, of, the, far, east, air, force, was, all, but, destroyed, over, the, next, few, days, macarthur, attempted, to, slow, the, japanese, advance, with, an, initial, defense, against, the, japanese, landings, macarthur, s, plan, for, holding, all, of, luzon, against, the, japanese, collapsed, for, it, distributed, the, american, filipino, forces, too, thinly, however, he, reconsidered, his, overconfidence, in, the, ability, of, his, filipino, troops, after, the, japanese, landing, force, made, a, rapid, advance, following, its, landing, at, lingayen, gulf, on, 21, december, and, ordered, a, retreat, to, bataan, within, two, days, of, the, japanese, landing, at, lingayen, gulf, macarthur, had, reverted, to, the, pre, july, 1941, plan, of, attempting, to, hold, only, bataan, while, waiting, for, a, relief, force, to, come, however, this, switching, of, plans, came, at, a, grueling, price, most, of, the, american, and, some, of, the, filipino, troops, were, able, to, retreat, back, to, bataan, but, without, most, of, their, supplies, which, were, abandoned, in, the, confusion, manila, was, declared, an, open, city, at, midnight, on, 24, december, without, any, consultation, with, admiral, thomas, c, hart, commanding, the, asiatic, fleet, forcing, the, navy, to, destroy, considerable, amounts, of, valuable, materiel, the, asiatic, fleet, s, performance, during, december, 1941, was, poor, although, the, surface, fleet, was, obsolete, and, was, safely, evacuated, to, try, to, defend, the, dutch, east, indies, more, than, two, dozen, modern, submarines, were, assigned, to, manila, hart, s, strongest, fighting, force, the, submariners, were, confident, but, they, were, armed, with, the, malfunctioning, mark, 14, torpedo, and, were, unable, to, sink, a, single, japanese, warship, during, the, invasion, macarthur, thought, the, navy, betrayed, him, the, submariners, were, ordered, to, abandon, the, philippines, by, the, end, of, december, after, ineffective, attacks, on, the, japanese, fleet, only, returning, to, corregidor, to, evacuate, high, ranking, politicians, or, officers, for, the, rest, of, the, campaign, on, the, evening, of, 24, december, macarthur, moved, his, headquarters, to, the, island, fortress, of, corregidor, in, manila, bay, arriving, at, 21, 30, with, his, headquarters, reporting, to, washington, as, being, open, on, the, 25th, a, series, of, air, raids, by, the, japanese, destroyed, all, the, exposed, structures, on, the, island, and, usaffe, headquarters, was, moved, into, the, malinta, tunnel, in, the, first, ever, air, raid, on, corregidor, on, 29, december, japanese, airplanes, bombed, all, the, buildings, on, topside, including, macarthur, s, house, and, the, barracks, macarthur, s, family, ran, into, the, air, raid, shelter, while, macarthur, went, outside, to, the, garden, of, the, house, with, some, soldiers, to, observe, and, count, the, number, of, bombers, involved, in, the, raid, when, bombs, destroyed, the, home, one, bomb, struck, only, ten, feet, from, macarthur, and, the, soldiers, shielded, him, with, their, bodies, and, helmets, filipino, sergeant, domingo, adversario, was, awarded, the, silver, star, and, purple, heart, for, getting, his, hand, wounded, by, the, bomb, and, covering, macarthur, s, head, with, his, own, helmet, which, was, also, hit, by, shrapnel, macarthur, was, not, wounded, later, most, of, the, headquarters, moved, to, bataan, leaving, only, the, nucleus, with, macarthur, the, troops, on, bataan, knew, that, they, had, been, written, off, but, continued, to, fight, some, blamed, roosevelt, and, macarthur, for, their, predicament, a, ballad, sung, to, the, tune, of, the, battle, hymn, of, the, republic, called, him, dugout, doug, however, most, clung, to, the, belief, that, somehow, macarthur, would, reach, down, and, pull, something, out, of, his, hat, on, 1, january, 1942, macarthur, accepted, 500, 000, equivalent, to, 7, 37, million, in, 2023, from, president, quezon, of, the, philippines, as, payment, for, his, pre, war, service, macarthur, s, staff, members, also, received, payments, 75, 000, for, sutherland, 45, 000, for, richard, marshall, and, 20, 000, for, huff, equivalent, to, 1, 11, million, 664, 000, and, 295, 000, in, 2023, respectively, eisenhower, after, being, appointed, supreme, commander, allied, expeditionary, force, aef, was, also, offered, money, by, quezon, but, declined, these, payments, were, known, only, to, a, few, in, manila, and, washington, including, president, roosevelt, and, secretary, of, war, henry, l, stimson, until, they, were, made, public, by, historian, carol, petillo, in, 1979, while, the, payments, had, been, fully, legal, the, revelation, tarnished, macarthur, s, reputation, in, february, 1942, as, japanese, forces, tightened, their, grip, on, the, philippines, president, roosevelt, ordered, macarthur, to, relocate, to, australia, on, the, night, of, 12, march, 1942, macarthur, and, a, select, group, that, included, his, wife, jean, son, arthur, arthur, s, cantonese, amah, loh, chui, and, other, members, of, his, staff, including, sutherland, richard, marshall, and, huff, left, corregidor, they, traveled, in, pt, boats, through, stormy, seas, patrolled, by, japanese, warships, and, reached, del, monte, airfield, on, mindanao, where, b, 17s, picked, them, up, and, flew, them, to, australia, macarthur, ultimately, arrived, in, melbourne, by, train, on, 21, march, his, famous, declaration, i, came, through, and, i, shall, return, was, first, made, at, terowie, railway, station, in, south, australia, on, 20, march, washington, asked, macarthur, to, amend, his, promise, to, we, shall, return, he, ignored, the, request, bataan, surrendered, on, 9, april, and, corregidor, on, 6, may, george, marshall, decided, that, macarthur, would, be, awarded, the, medal, of, honor, a, decoration, for, which, he, had, twice, previously, been, nominated, to, offset, any, propaganda, by, the, enemy, directed, at, his, leaving, his, command, eisenhower, pointed, out, that, macarthur, had, not, actually, performed, any, acts, of, valor, as, required, by, law, but, marshall, cited, the, 1927, award, of, the, medal, to, charles, lindbergh, as, a, precedent, special, legislation, had, been, passed, to, authorize, lindbergh, s, medal, but, while, similar, legislation, was, introduced, authorizing, the, medal, for, macarthur, by, congressmen, j, parnell, thomas, and, james, e, van, zandt, marshall, felt, strongly, that, a, serving, general, should, receive, the, medal, from, the, president, and, the, war, department, expressing, that, the, recognition, would, mean, more, if, the, gallantry, criteria, were, not, waived, by, a, bill, of, relief, marshall, ordered, sutherland, to, recommend, the, award, and, authored, the, citation, himself, ironically, this, also, meant, that, it, violated, the, governing, statute, as, it, could, only, be, considered, lawful, so, long, as, material, requirements, were, waived, by, congress, such, as, the, unmet, requirement, to, perform, conspicuous, gallantry, above, and, beyond, the, call, of, duty, marshall, admitted, the, defect, to, the, secretary, of, war, acknowledging, that, there, is, no, specific, act, of, general, macarthur, s, to, justify, the, award, of, the, medal, of, honor, under, a, literal, interpretation, of, the, statutes, similarly, when, the, army, s, adjutant, general, reviewed, the, case, in, 1945, he, determined, that, authority, for, award, is, questionable, under, strict, interpretation, of, regulations, macarthur, had, been, nominated, for, the, award, twice, before, and, understood, that, it, was, for, leadership, and, not, gallantry, he, expressed, the, sentiment, that, this, award, was, intended, not, so, much, for, me, personally, as, it, is, a, recognition, of, the, indomitable, courage, of, the, gallant, army, which, it, was, my, honor, to, command, at, the, age, of, 62, macarthur, was, the, oldest, living, active, duty, medal, of, honor, recipient, in, history, and, as, a, four, star, general, he, was, the, highest, ranked, military, servicemember, to, ever, receive, the, medal, of, honor, arthur, and, douglas, macarthur, thus, became, the, first, father, and, son, to, be, awarded, the, medal, of, honor, they, remained, the, only, pair, until, 2001, when, theodore, roosevelt, was, posthumously, awarded, for, his, service, during, the, spanish, american, war, theodore, roosevelt, jr, having, received, one, posthumously, for, his, gallantry, during, the, world, war, ii, normandy, invasion, macarthur, s, citation, written, by, marshall, read, for, conspicuous, leadership, in, preparing, the, philippine, islands, to, resist, conquest, for, gallantry, and, intrepidity, above, and, beyond, the, call, of, duty, in, action, against, invading, japanese, forces, and, for, the, heroic, conduct, of, defensive, and, offensive, operations, on, the, bataan, peninsula, he, mobilized, trained, and, led, an, army, which, has, received, world, acclaim, for, its, gallant, defense, against, a, tremendous, superiority, of, enemy, forces, in, men, and, arms, his, utter, disregard, of, personal, danger, under, heavy, fire, and, aerial, bombardment, his, calm, judgment, in, each, crisis, inspired, his, troops, galvanized, the, spirit, of, resistance, of, the, filipino, people, and, confirmed, the, faith, of, the, american, people, in, their, armed, forces, as, the, symbol, of, the, forces, resisting, the, japanese, macarthur, received, many, other, accolades, the, native, american, tribes, of, the, southwest, chose, him, as, a, chief, of, chiefs, which, he, acknowledged, as, from, my, oldest, friends, the, companions, of, my, boyhood, days, on, the, western, frontier, he, was, touched, when, he, was, named, father, of, the, year, for, 1942, and, wrote, to, the, national, father, s, day, committee, that, by, profession, i, am, a, soldier, and, take, pride, in, that, fact, but, i, am, prouder, infinitely, prouder, to, be, a, father, a, soldier, destroys, in, order, to, build, the, father, only, builds, never, destroys, the, one, has, the, potentialities, of, death, the, other, embodies, creation, and, life, and, while, the, hordes, of, death, are, mighty, the, battalions, of, life, are, mightier, still, it, is, my, hope, that, my, son, when, i, am, gone, will, remember, me, not, from, battle, but, in, the, home, repeating, with, him, our, simple, daily, prayer, our, father, who, art, in, heaven, on, 18, april, 1942, macarthur, was, appointed, supreme, commander, of, allied, forces, in, the, southwest, pacific, area, swpa, lieutenant, general, george, brett, became, commander, allied, air, forces, and, vice, admiral, herbert, f, leary, became, commander, allied, naval, forces, since, the, bulk, of, land, forces, in, the, theater, were, australian, george, marshall, insisted, an, australian, be, appointed, as, commander, allied, land, forces, and, the, job, went, to, general, sir, thomas, blamey, although, predominantly, australian, and, american, macarthur, s, command, also, included, small, numbers, of, personnel, from, the, netherlands, east, indies, the, united, kingdom, and, other, countries, macarthur, established, a, close, relationship, with, the, prime, minister, of, australia, john, curtin, and, was, probably, the, second, most, powerful, person, in, the, country, after, the, prime, minister, although, many, australians, resented, macarthur, as, a, foreign, general, who, had, been, imposed, upon, them, macarthur, had, little, confidence, in, brett, s, abilities, as, commander, of, allied, air, forces, and, in, august, 1942, selected, major, general, george, c, kenney, to, replace, him, kenney, s, application, of, air, power, in, support, of, blamey, s, troops, would, prove, crucial, the, staff, of, macarthur, s, general, headquarters, ghq, was, built, around, the, nucleus, that, had, escaped, from, the, philippines, with, him, who, became, known, as, the, bataan, gang, though, roosevelt, and, george, marshall, pressed, for, dutch, and, australian, officers, to, be, assigned, to, ghq, the, heads, of, all, the, staff, divisions, were, american, and, such, officers, of, other, nationalities, as, were, assigned, served, under, them, initially, located, in, melbourne, ghq, moved, to, brisbane, the, northernmost, city, in, australia, with, the, necessary, communications, facilities, in, july, 1942, occupying, the, australian, mutual, provident, society, building, renamed, after, the, war, as, macarthur, chambers, macarthur, formed, his, own, signals, intelligence, organization, known, as, the, central, bureau, from, australian, intelligence, units, and, american, cryptanalysts, who, had, escaped, from, the, philippines, this, unit, forwarded, ultra, information, to, macarthur, s, chief, of, intelligence, charles, a, willoughby, for, analysis, after, a, press, release, revealed, details, of, the, japanese, naval, dispositions, during, the, battle, of, the, coral, sea, at, which, a, japanese, attempt, to, capture, port, moresby, was, turned, back, roosevelt, ordered, that, censorship, be, imposed, in, australia, and, the, advisory, war, council, granted, ghq, censorship, authority, over, the, australian, press, australian, newspapers, were, restricted, to, what, was, reported, in, the, daily, ghq, communiqu, veteran, correspondents, considered, the, communiqu, s, which, macarthur, drafted, personally, a, total, farce, and, alice, in, wonderland, information, handed, out, at, high, level, anticipating, that, the, japanese, would, strike, at, port, moresby, again, the, garrison, was, strengthened, and, macarthur, ordered, the, establishment, of, new, bases, at, merauke, and, milne, bay, to, cover, its, flanks, the, battle, of, midway, in, june, 1942, led, to, consideration, of, a, limited, offensive, in, the, pacific, macarthur, s, proposal, for, an, attack, on, the, japanese, base, at, rabaul, met, with, objections, from, the, navy, which, favored, a, less, ambitious, approach, and, objected, to, an, army, general, being, in, command, of, what, would, be, an, amphibious, operation, the, resulting, compromise, called, for, a, three, stage, advance, the, first, stage, the, seizure, of, the, tulagi, area, would, be, conducted, by, the, pacific, ocean, areas, under, admiral, chester, w, nimitz, the, later, stages, would, be, under, macarthur, s, command, the, japanese, struck, first, landing, at, buna, in, july, and, at, milne, bay, in, august, the, australians, repulsed, the, japanese, at, milne, bay, but, a, series, of, defeats, in, the, kokoda, track, campaign, had, a, depressing, effect, back, in, australia, on, 30, august, macarthur, radioed, washington, that, unless, action, was, taken, new, guinea, force, would, be, overwhelmed, he, sent, blamey, to, port, moresby, to, take, personal, command, having, committed, all, available, australian, troops, macarthur, decided, to, send, american, forces, the, 32nd, infantry, division, a, poorly, trained, national, guard, division, was, selected, a, series, of, embarrassing, reverses, in, the, battle, of, buna, gona, led, to, outspoken, criticism, of, the, american, troops, by, the, australians, macarthur, then, ordered, lieutenant, general, robert, l, eichelberger, to, assume, command, of, the, americans, and, take, buna, or, not, come, back, alive, macarthur, moved, the, advanced, echelon, of, ghq, to, port, moresby, on, 6, november, 1942, after, buna, finally, fell, on, 3, january, 1943, macarthur, awarded, the, distinguished, service, cross, to, twelve, officers, for, precise, execution, of, operations, this, use, of, the, country, s, second, highest, award, aroused, resentment, because, while, some, like, eichelberger, and, george, alan, vasey, had, fought, in, the, field, others, like, sutherland, and, willoughby, had, not, for, his, part, macarthur, was, awarded, his, third, distinguished, service, medal, and, the, australian, government, had, him, appointed, an, honorary, knight, grand, cross, of, the, british, order, of, the, bath, at, the, pacific, military, conference, in, march, 1943, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, approved, macarthur, s, plan, for, operation, cartwheel, the, advance, on, rabaul, macarthur, explained, his, strategy, my, strategic, conception, for, the, pacific, theater, which, i, outlined, after, the, papuan, campaign, and, have, since, consistently, advocated, contemplates, massive, strokes, against, only, main, strategic, objectives, utilizing, surprise, and, air, ground, striking, power, supported, and, assisted, by, the, fleet, this, is, the, very, opposite, of, what, is, termed, island, hopping, which, is, the, gradual, pushing, back, of, the, enemy, by, direct, frontal, pressure, with, the, consequent, heavy, casualties, which, will, certainly, be, involved, key, points, must, of, course, be, taken, but, a, wise, choice, of, such, will, obviate, the, need, for, storming, the, mass, of, islands, now, in, enemy, possession, island, hopping, with, extravagant, losses, and, slow, progress, is, not, my, idea, of, how, to, end, the, war, as, soon, and, as, cheaply, as, possible, new, conditions, require, for, solution, and, new, weapons, require, for, maximum, application, new, and, imaginative, methods, wars, are, never, won, in, the, past, lieutenant, general, walter, krueger, s, sixth, army, headquarters, arrived, in, swpa, in, early, 1943, but, macarthur, had, only, three, american, divisions, and, they, were, tired, and, depleted, from, the, fighting, at, the, battle, of, buna, gona, and, the, battle, of, guadalcanal, as, a, result, it, became, obvious, that, any, military, offensive, in, the, south, west, pacific, in, 1943, would, have, to, be, carried, out, mainly, by, the, australian, army, the, offensive, began, with, the, landing, at, lae, by, the, australian, 9th, division, on, 4, september, 1943, the, next, day, macarthur, watched, the, landing, at, nadzab, by, paratroops, of, the, 503rd, parachute, infantry, his, b, 17, made, the, trip, on, three, engines, because, one, failed, soon, after, leaving, port, moresby, but, he, insisted, that, it, fly, on, to, nadzab, for, this, he, was, awarded, the, air, medal, the, australian, 7th, and, 9th, divisions, converged, on, lae, which, fell, on, 16, september, macarthur, advanced, his, timetable, and, ordered, the, 7th, to, capture, kaiapit, and, dumpu, while, the, 9th, mounted, an, amphibious, assault, on, finschhafen, here, the, offensive, bogged, down, partly, because, macarthur, had, based, his, decision, to, assault, finschhafen, on, willoughby, s, assessment, that, there, were, only, 350, japanese, defenders, at, finschhafen, when, in, fact, there, were, nearly, 5, 000, a, furious, battle, ensued, in, early, november, macarthur, s, plan, for, a, westward, advance, along, the, coast, of, new, guinea, to, the, philippines, was, incorporated, into, plans, for, the, war, against, japan, three, months, later, airmen, reported, no, signs, of, enemy, activity, in, the, admiralty, islands, although, willoughby, did, not, agree, that, the, islands, had, been, evacuated, macarthur, ordered, an, amphibious, landing, there, commencing, the, admiralty, islands, campaign, he, accompanied, the, assault, force, aboard, the, light, cruiser, phoenix, the, flagship, of, vice, admiral, thomas, c, kinkaid, the, new, commander, of, the, seventh, fleet, and, came, ashore, seven, hours, after, the, first, wave, of, landing, craft, for, which, he, was, awarded, the, bronze, star, it, took, six, weeks, of, fierce, fighting, before, the, 1st, cavalry, division, captured, the, islands, macarthur, had, one, of, the, most, powerful, pr, machines, of, any, allied, general, during, the, war, which, made, him, into, an, extremely, popular, war, hero, with, the, american, people, in, late, 1943, early, 1944, there, was, a, serious, effort, by, the, conservative, faction, in, the, republican, party, centered, in, the, midwest, to, have, macarthur, seek, the, republican, nomination, to, be, the, candidate, for, the, presidency, in, the, 1944, election, as, they, regarded, the, two, men, most, likely, to, win, the, republican, nomination, namely, wendell, willkie, and, governor, thomas, e, dewey, of, new, york, as, too, liberal, for, a, time, macarthur, who, had, long, seen, himself, as, a, potential, president, was, in, the, words, of, the, u, s, historian, gerhard, weinberg, very, interested, in, running, as, the, republican, candidate, in, 1944, however, macarthur, s, vow, to, return, to, the, philippines, had, not, been, fulfilled, in, early, 1944, and, he, decided, not, to, run, for, president, until, he, had, liberated, the, philippines, furthermore, weinberg, had, argued, that, it, is, probable, that, roosevelt, who, knew, of, the, enormous, gratuity, macarthur, had, accepted, from, quezon, in, 1942, had, used, his, knowledge, of, this, transaction, to, blackmail, macarthur, into, not, running, for, president, finally, despite, the, best, efforts, of, the, conservative, republicans, to, put, macarthur, s, name, on, the, ballot, on, 4, april, 1944, governor, dewey, won, such, a, convincing, victory, in, the, wisconsin, primary, regarded, as, a, significant, victory, given, that, the, midwest, was, a, stronghold, of, the, conservative, republicans, opposed, to, dewey, as, to, ensure, that, he, would, win, the, republican, nomination, to, be, the, gop, s, candidate, for, president, in, 1944, macarthur, bypassed, the, japanese, forces, at, hansa, bay, and, wewak, and, assaulted, hollandia, and, aitape, which, willoughby, reported, being, lightly, defended, based, on, intelligence, gathered, in, the, battle, of, sio, macarthur, s, bold, thrust, by, going, 600, miles, up, the, coast, had, surprised, and, confused, the, japanese, high, command, who, had, not, anticipated, that, macarthur, would, take, such, risks, although, they, were, out, of, range, of, the, fifth, air, force, s, fighters, based, in, the, ramu, valley, the, timing, of, the, operation, allowed, the, aircraft, carriers, of, nimitz, s, pacific, fleet, to, provide, air, support, though, risky, the, operation, turned, out, to, be, another, success, macarthur, caught, the, japanese, off, balance, and, cut, off, lieutenant, general, hataz, adachi, s, japanese, xviii, army, in, the, wewak, area, because, the, japanese, were, not, expecting, an, attack, the, garrison, was, weak, and, allied, casualties, were, correspondingly, light, however, the, terrain, turned, out, to, be, less, suitable, for, airbase, development, than, first, thought, forcing, macarthur, to, seek, better, locations, further, west, while, bypassing, japanese, forces, had, great, tactical, merit, it, had, the, strategic, drawback, of, tying, up, allied, troops, to, contain, them, moreover, adachi, was, far, from, beaten, which, he, demonstrated, in, the, battle, of, driniumor, river, in, july, 1944, president, roosevelt, summoned, macarthur, to, meet, with, him, in, hawaii, to, determine, the, phase, of, action, against, japan, nimitz, made, the, case, for, attacking, formosa, macarthur, stressed, america, s, moral, obligation, to, liberate, the, philippines, and, won, roosevelt, s, support, in, september, admiral, william, halsey, jr, s, carriers, made, a, series, of, air, strikes, on, the, philippines, opposition, was, feeble, halsey, concluded, incorrectly, that, leyte, was, wide, open, and, possibly, undefended, and, recommended, that, projected, operations, be, skipped, in, favor, of, an, assault, on, leyte, on, 20, october, 1944, troops, of, krueger, s, sixth, army, landed, on, leyte, while, macarthur, watched, from, the, light, cruiser, uss, nashville, that, afternoon, he, arrived, on, the, beach, the, advance, had, not, progressed, far, snipers, were, still, active, and, the, area, was, under, sporadic, mortar, fire, when, his, whaleboat, grounded, in, knee, deep, water, macarthur, requested, a, landing, craft, but, the, beachmaster, was, too, busy, to, grant, his, request, macarthur, was, compelled, to, wade, ashore, in, his, prepared, speech, he, said, people, of, the, philippines, i, have, returned, by, the, grace, of, almighty, god, our, forces, stand, again, on, philippine, soil, soil, consecrated, in, the, blood, of, our, two, peoples, we, have, come, dedicated, and, committed, to, the, task, of, destroying, every, vestige, of, enemy, control, over, your, daily, lives, and, of, restoring, upon, a, foundation, of, indestructible, strength, the, liberties, of, your, people, since, leyte, was, out, of, range, of, kenney, s, land, based, aircraft, macarthur, was, dependent, on, carrier, aircraft, japanese, air, activity, soon, increased, with, raids, on, tacloban, where, macarthur, decided, to, establish, his, headquarters, and, on, the, fleet, offshore, macarthur, enjoyed, staying, on, nashville, s, bridge, during, air, raids, although, several, bombs, landed, close, by, and, two, nearby, cruisers, were, hit, over, the, next, few, days, the, japanese, counterattacked, in, the, battle, of, leyte, gulf, resulting, in, a, near, disaster, that, macarthur, attributed, to, the, command, being, divided, between, himself, and, nimitz, nor, did, the, campaign, ashore, proceed, smoothly, heavy, monsoonal, rains, disrupted, the, airbase, construction, program, carrier, aircraft, proved, to, be, no, substitute, for, land, based, aircraft, and, the, lack, of, air, cover, permitted, the, japanese, to, pour, troops, into, leyte, adverse, weather, and, tough, japanese, resistance, slowed, the, american, advance, resulting, in, a, protracted, campaign, by, the, end, of, december, krueger, s, headquarters, estimated, that, 5, 000, japanese, remained, on, leyte, and, on, 26, december, macarthur, issued, a, communiqu, announcing, that, the, campaign, can, now, be, regarded, as, closed, except, for, minor, mopping, up, yet, eichelberger, s, eighth, army, killed, another, 27, 000, japanese, on, leyte, before, the, campaign, ended, in, may, 1945, on, 18, december, 1944, macarthur, was, promoted, to, the, new, five, star, rank, of, general, of, the, army, placing, him, in, the, company, of, marshall, and, followed, by, eisenhower, and, henry, hap, arnold, the, only, four, men, to, achieve, the, rank, in, world, war, ii, including, omar, bradley, who, was, promoted, during, the, korean, war, so, as, not, to, be, outranked, by, macarthur, they, were, the, only, five, men, to, achieve, the, rank, of, general, of, the, army, since, the, 5, august, 1888, death, of, philip, sheridan, macarthur, was, senior, to, all, but, marshall, the, rank, was, created, by, an, act, of, congress, when, public, law, 78, 482, was, passed, on, 14, december, 1944, as, a, temporary, rank, subject, to, reversion, to, permanent, rank, six, months, after, the, end, of, the, war, the, temporary, rank, was, then, declared, permanent, 23, march, 1946, by, public, law, 333, of, the, 79th, congress, which, also, awarded, full, pay, and, allowances, in, the, grade, to, those, on, the, retired, list, macarthur, s, next, move, was, the, invasion, of, mindoro, where, there, were, good, potential, airfield, sites, willoughby, estimated, correctly, as, it, turned, out, that, the, island, had, only, about, 1, 000, japanese, defenders, the, problem, this, time, was, getting, there, kinkaid, balked, at, sending, escort, carriers, into, the, restricted, waters, of, the, sulu, sea, and, kenney, could, not, guarantee, land, based, air, cover, the, operation, was, clearly, hazardous, and, macarthur, s, staff, talked, him, out, of, accompanying, the, invasion, on, nashville, as, the, invasion, force, entered, the, sulu, sea, a, kamikaze, struck, nashville, killing, 133, people, and, wounding, 190, more, australian, and, american, engineers, had, three, airstrips, in, operation, within, two, weeks, but, the, resupply, convoys, were, repeatedly, attacked, by, kamikazes, during, this, time, macarthur, quarreled, with, sutherland, notorious, for, his, abrasiveness, over, the, latter, s, mistress, captain, elaine, clark, macarthur, had, instructed, sutherland, not, to, bring, clark, to, leyte, due, to, a, personal, undertaking, to, curtin, that, australian, women, on, the, ghq, staff, would, not, be, taken, to, the, philippines, but, sutherland, had, brought, her, along, anyway, the, way, was, now, clear, for, the, invasion, of, luzon, this, time, based, on, different, interpretations, of, the, same, intelligence, data, willoughby, estimated, the, strength, of, general, tomoyuki, yamashita, s, forces, on, luzon, at, 137, 000, while, sixth, army, estimated, it, at, 234, 000, macarthur, s, response, was, bunk, he, felt, that, even, willoughby, s, estimate, was, too, high, audacity, calculated, risk, and, a, clear, strategic, aim, were, macarthur, s, attributes, and, he, disregarded, the, estimates, in, fact, they, were, too, low, yamashita, had, more, than, 287, 000, troops, on, luzon, this, time, macarthur, traveled, aboard, the, light, cruiser, uss, boise, watching, as, the, ship, was, nearly, hit, by, a, bomb, and, torpedoes, fired, by, midget, submarines, his, communiqu, read, the, decisive, battle, for, the, liberation, of, the, philippines, and, the, control, of, the, southwest, pacific, is, at, hand, general, macarthur, is, in, personal, command, at, the, front, and, landed, with, his, assault, troops, macarthur, s, primary, concern, was, the, capture, of, the, port, of, manila, and, the, airbase, at, clark, field, which, were, required, to, support, future, operations, he, urged, his, commanders, on, on, 25, january, 1945, he, moved, his, advanced, headquarters, forward, to, hacienda, luisita, closer, to, the, front, than, krueger, s, he, ordered, the, 1st, cavalry, division, to, conduct, a, rapid, advance, on, manila, it, reached, the, northern, outskirts, of, manila, on, 3, february, but, unknown, to, the, americans, rear, admiral, sanji, iwabuchi, had, decided, to, defend, manila, to, the, death, the, battle, of, manila, raged, for, the, next, three, weeks, to, spare, the, civilian, population, macarthur, prohibited, the, use, of, air, strikes, but, thousands, of, civilians, died, in, the, crossfire, or, japanese, massacres, he, also, refused, to, restrict, the, traffic, of, civilians, who, clogged, the, roads, in, and, out, of, manila, placing, humanitarian, concerns, above, military, ones, except, in, emergencies, for, his, part, in, the, capture, of, manila, macarthur, was, awarded, his, third, distinguished, service, cross, after, taking, manila, macarthur, installed, one, of, his, filipino, friends, manuel, roxas, who, also, happened, to, be, one, of, the, few, people, who, knew, about, the, huge, sum, of, money, quezon, had, given, macarthur, in, 1942, into, a, position, of, power, that, ensured, roxas, was, to, become, the, next, filipino, president, roxas, had, been, a, leading, japanese, collaborator, serving, in, the, puppet, government, of, jos, laurel, but, macarthur, claimed, that, roxas, had, secretly, been, an, american, agent, all, the, long, about, macarthur, s, claim, that, roxas, was, really, part, of, the, resistance, weinberg, wrote, that, evidence, to, this, effect, has, yet, to, surface, and, that, by, favoring, the, japanese, collaborator, roxas, macarthur, ensured, there, was, no, serious, effort, to, address, the, issue, of, filipino, collaboration, with, the, japanese, after, the, war, there, was, evidence, that, roxas, used, his, position, of, working, in, the, japanese, puppet, government, to, secretly, gather, intelligence, to, pass, onto, guerillas, macarthur, and, his, intelligence, staff, during, the, occupation, period, one, of, the, major, reasons, for, macarthur, to, return, to, the, philippines, was, to, liberate, prisoner, of, war, camps, and, civilian, internee, camps, as, well, as, to, relieve, the, filipino, civilians, suffering, at, the, hands, of, the, very, brutal, japanese, occupiers, macarthur, authorized, daring, rescue, raids, at, numerous, prison, camps, like, cabanatuan, los, ba, os, and, santo, tomas, at, santo, tomas, japanese, guards, held, 200, prisoners, hostage, but, the, u, s, soldiers, were, able, to, negotiate, safe, passage, for, the, japanese, to, escape, peacefully, in, exchange, for, the, release, of, the, prisoners, after, the, battle, of, manila, macarthur, turned, his, attention, to, yamashita, who, had, retreated, into, the, mountains, of, central, and, northern, luzon, yamashita, chose, to, fight, a, defensive, campaign, being, pushed, back, slowly, by, krueger, and, was, still, holding, out, at, the, time, the, war, ended, much, to, macarthur, s, intense, annoyance, as, he, had, wished, to, liberate, the, entire, philippines, before, the, war, ended, on, 2, september, 1945, yamashita, who, had, a, hard, time, believing, that, the, emperor, had, ordered, japan, to, sign, an, armistice, came, down, from, the, mountains, to, surrender, with, some, 100, 000, of, his, men, although, macarthur, had, no, specific, directive, to, do, so, and, the, fighting, on, luzon, was, far, from, over, he, committed, his, forces, to, liberate, the, remainder, of, the, philippines, in, the, ghq, communiqu, on, 5, july, he, announced, that, the, philippines, had, been, liberated, and, all, operations, ended, although, yamashita, still, held, out, in, northern, luzon, starting, in, may, 1945, macarthur, used, his, australian, troops, in, the, invasion, of, borneo, he, accompanied, the, assault, on, labuan, and, visited, the, troops, ashore, while, returning, to, ghq, in, manila, he, visited, davao, where, he, told, eichelberger, that, no, more, than, 4, 000, japanese, remained, alive, on, mindanao, a, few, months, later, six, times, that, number, surrendered, in, july, 1945, he, was, awarded, his, fourth, distinguished, service, medal, as, part, of, preparations, for, operation, downfall, the, invasion, of, japan, macarthur, became, commander, in, chief, u, s, army, forces, pacific, afpac, in, april, 1945, assuming, command, of, all, army, and, army, air, force, units, in, the, pacific, except, the, twentieth, air, force, at, the, same, time, nimitz, became, commander, of, all, naval, forces, command, in, the, pacific, therefore, remained, divided, during, his, planning, of, the, invasion, of, japan, macarthur, stressed, to, the, decision, makers, in, washington, that, it, was, essential, to, have, the, soviet, union, enter, the, war, as, he, argued, it, was, crucial, to, have, the, red, army, tie, down, the, kwantung, army, in, manchuria, the, invasion, was, pre, empted, by, the, surrender, of, japan, in, august, 1945, on, 2, september, macarthur, accepted, the, formal, japanese, surrender, aboard, the, battleship, uss, missouri, thus, ending, hostilities, in, world, war, ii, in, recognition, of, his, role, as, a, maritime, strategist, the, u, s, navy, awarded, him, the, navy, distinguished, service, medal, on, 29, august, 1945, macarthur, was, ordered, to, exercise, authority, through, the, japanese, government, machinery, including, the, emperor, hirohito, macarthur, s, headquarters, was, located, in, the, dai, ichi, life, insurance, building, in, tokyo, unlike, in, germany, where, the, allies, had, in, may, 1945, abolished, the, german, state, the, americans, chose, to, allow, the, japanese, state, to, continue, to, exist, albeit, under, their, ultimate, control, unlike, germany, there, was, a, certain, partnership, between, the, occupiers, and, occupied, as, macarthur, decided, to, rule, japan, via, the, emperor, and, most, of, the, rest, of, the, japanese, elite, the, emperor, was, a, living, god, to, the, japanese, people, and, macarthur, found, that, ruling, via, the, emperor, made, his, job, in, running, japan, much, easier, than, it, otherwise, would, have, been, after, the, japanese, surrender, in, august, 1945, there, was, a, large, amount, of, pressure, that, came, from, both, allied, countries, and, japanese, leftists, that, demanded, the, emperor, step, down, and, be, indicted, as, a, war, criminal, macarthur, disagreed, as, he, thought, that, an, ostensibly, cooperating, emperor, would, help, establish, a, peaceful, allied, occupation, regime, in, japan, since, retaining, the, emperor, was, crucial, to, ensuring, control, over, the, population, the, allied, forces, shielded, him, from, war, responsibility, and, avoided, undermining, his, authority, evidence, that, would, incriminate, the, emperor, and, his, family, was, excluded, from, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, code, named, operation, blacklist, macarthur, created, a, plan, that, separated, the, emperor, from, the, militarists, retained, the, emperor, as, a, constitutional, monarch, but, only, as, a, figurehead, and, used, the, emperor, to, retain, control, over, japan, and, help, the, u, s, achieve, their, objectives, the, american, historian, herbert, p, bix, described, the, relationship, between, the, general, and, the, emperor, as, the, allied, commander, would, use, the, emperor, and, the, emperor, would, cooperate, in, being, used, their, relationship, became, one, of, expediency, and, mutual, protection, of, more, political, benefit, to, hirohito, than, to, macarthur, because, hirohito, had, more, to, lose, the, entire, panoply, of, symbolic, legitimizing, properties, of, the, imperial, throne, at, the, same, time, macarthur, undermined, the, imperial, mystique, when, his, staff, released, a, picture, of, his, first, meeting, with, the, emperor, the, impact, of, which, on, the, japanese, public, was, electric, as, the, japanese, people, for, the, first, time, saw, the, emperor, as, a, mere, man, overshadowed, by, the, much, taller, macarthur, instead, of, the, living, god, he, had, always, been, portrayed, as, up, to, 1945, the, emperor, had, been, a, remote, mysterious, figure, to, his, people, rarely, seen, in, public, and, always, silent, whose, photographs, were, always, taken, from, a, certain, angle, to, make, him, look, taller, and, more, impressive, than, he, really, was, no, japanese, photographer, would, have, taken, such, a, photo, of, the, emperor, being, overshadowed, by, macarthur, the, japanese, government, immediately, banned, the, photo, of, the, emperor, with, macarthur, on, the, grounds, that, it, damaged, the, imperial, mystique, but, macarthur, rescinded, the, ban, and, ordered, all, of, the, japanese, newspapers, to, print, it, the, photo, was, intended, as, a, message, to, the, emperor, about, who, was, going, to, be, the, senior, partner, in, their, relationship, as, he, needed, the, emperor, macarthur, protected, him, from, any, effort, to, hold, him, accountable, for, his, actions, and, allowed, him, to, issue, statements, that, incorrectly, portrayed, the, emerging, democratic, post, war, era, as, a, continuation, of, the, meiji, era, reforms, macarthur, did, not, allow, any, investigations, of, the, emperor, and, instead, in, october, 1945, ordered, his, staff, in, the, interests, of, peaceful, occupation, and, rehabilitation, of, japan, prevention, of, revolution, and, communism, all, facts, surrounding, the, execution, of, the, declaration, of, war, and, subsequent, position, of, the, emperor, which, tend, to, show, fraud, menace, or, duress, be, marshalled, in, january, 1946, macarthur, reported, to, washington, that, the, emperor, could, not, be, indicted, for, war, crimes, on, the, grounds, his, indictment, will, unquestionably, cause, a, tremendous, convulsion, among, the, japanese, people, the, repercussions, of, which, cannot, be, overestimated, he, is, a, symbol, which, unites, all, japanese, destroy, him, and, the, nation, will, disintegrate, it, is, quite, possible, that, a, million, troops, would, be, required, which, would, have, to, be, maintained, for, an, indefinite, number, of, years, to, protect, the, emperor, from, being, indicted, macarthur, had, one, of, his, staff, brigadier, general, bonner, fellers, tell, the, genr, admiral, mitsumasa, yonai, on, 6, march, 1946, to, counter, this, situation, it, would, be, most, convenient, if, the, japanese, side, could, prove, to, us, that, the, emperor, is, completely, blameless, i, think, the, forthcoming, trials, offer, the, best, opportunity, to, do, that, tojo, in, particular, should, be, made, to, bear, all, responsibility, at, his, trial, i, want, you, to, have, tojo, say, as, follows, at, the, imperial, conference, prior, to, the, start, of, the, war, i, already, decided, to, push, for, war, even, if, his, majesty, the, emperor, was, against, going, to, war, with, the, united, states, from, the, viewpoint, of, both, sides, having, one, especially, evil, figure, in, the, form, of, general, hideki, tojo, on, whom, everything, that, went, wrong, could, be, blamed, was, most, politically, convenient, at, a, second, meeting, on, 22, march, 1946, fellers, told, yonai, the, most, influential, advocate, of, un, american, thought, in, the, united, states, is, cohen, a, jew, and, a, communist, the, top, adviser, to, secretary, of, state, byrnes, as, i, told, yonai, it, is, extremely, disadvantageous, to, macarthur, s, standing, in, the, united, states, to, put, on, trial, the, very, emperor, who, is, cooperating, with, him, and, facilitating, the, smooth, administration, of, the, occupation, this, is, the, reason, for, my, request, i, wonder, whether, what, i, said, to, admiral, yonai, the, other, day, has, already, been, conveyed, to, tojo, macarthur, s, attempts, to, shield, the, emperor, from, indictment, and, to, have, all, the, blame, taken, by, tojo, were, successful, which, as, bix, commented, had, a, lasting, and, profoundly, distorting, impact, on, the, japanese, understanding, of, the, lost, war, macarthur, was, responsible, for, confirming, and, enforcing, the, sentences, for, war, crimes, handed, down, by, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, in, late, 1945, allied, military, commissions, in, various, cities, in, asia, tried, 5, 700, japanese, taiwanese, and, koreans, for, war, crimes, about, 4, 300, were, convicted, almost, 1, 000, sentenced, to, death, and, hundreds, given, life, imprisonment, the, charges, arose, from, incidents, that, included, the, rape, of, nanking, the, bataan, death, march, and, manila, massacre, the, trial, in, manila, of, yamashita, was, criticized, because, he, was, hanged, for, iwabuchi, s, manila, massacre, which, he, had, not, ordered, and, of, which, he, was, probably, unaware, iwabuchi, had, killed, himself, as, the, battle, for, manila, was, ending, macarthur, recommended, that, shiro, ishii, and, other, members, of, unit, 731, be, granted, immunity, from, prosecution, in, exchange, for, germ, warfare, data, based, on, human, experimentation, he, also, exempted, the, emperor, and, all, members, of, the, imperial, family, implicated, in, war, crimes, including, princes, such, as, chichibu, asaka, takeda, higashikuni, and, fushimi, from, criminal, prosecutions, macarthur, said, that, the, emperor, s, abdication, would, not, be, necessary, in, doing, so, he, ignored, the, advice, of, many, members, of, the, imperial, family, and, japanese, intellectuals, who, publicly, called, for, the, abdication, of, the, emperor, and, the, implementation, of, a, regency, his, reasoning, was, if, the, emperor, were, executed, or, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, there, would, be, a, violent, backlash, and, revolution, from, the, japanese, from, all, social, classes, and, this, would, interfere, with, his, primary, goal, to, change, japan, from, a, militarist, feudal, society, to, a, pro, western, modern, democracy, in, a, cable, sent, to, general, dwight, eisenhower, in, february, 1946, macarthur, said, executing, or, imprisoning, the, emperor, would, require, the, use, of, one, million, occupation, soldiers, to, keep, the, peace, as, supreme, commander, for, the, allied, powers, scap, in, japan, macarthur, and, his, staff, helped, japan, rebuild, itself, eradicate, militarism, and, ultra, nationalism, promote, political, civil, liberties, institute, democratic, government, and, chart, a, new, course, that, ultimately, made, japan, one, of, the, world, s, leading, industrial, powers, the, u, s, was, firmly, in, control, of, japan, to, oversee, its, reconstruction, and, macarthur, was, effectively, the, interim, leader, of, japan, from, 1945, until, 1948, in, 1946, macarthur, s, staff, drafted, a, new, constitution, that, renounced, war, and, stripped, the, emperor, of, his, military, authority, the, constitution, which, became, effective, on, 3, may, 1947, instituted, a, parliamentary, system, of, government, under, which, the, emperor, acted, only, on, the, advice, of, his, ministers, it, included, article, 9, which, outlawed, belligerency, as, an, instrument, of, state, policy, and, the, maintenance, of, a, standing, army, the, constitution, also, enfranchised, women, guaranteed, fundamental, human, rights, outlawed, racial, discrimination, strengthened, the, powers, of, parliament, and, the, cabinet, and, decentralized, the, police, and, local, government, a, major, land, reform, was, also, conducted, led, by, wolf, ladejinsky, of, macarthur, s, scap, staff, between, 1947, and, 1949, approximately, 4, 700, 000, acres, 1, 900, 000, ha, or, 38, of, japan, s, cultivated, land, was, purchased, from, the, landlords, under, the, government, s, reform, program, and, 4, 600, 000, acres, 1, 860, 000, ha, was, resold, to, the, farmers, who, worked, them, by, 1950, 89, of, all, agricultural, land, was, owner, operated, and, only, 11, was, tenant, operated, macarthur, s, efforts, to, encourage, trade, union, membership, met, with, phenomenal, success, and, by, 1947, 48, of, the, non, agricultural, workforce, was, unionized, some, of, macarthur, s, reforms, were, rescinded, in, 1948, when, his, unilateral, control, of, japan, was, ended, by, the, increased, involvement, of, the, state, department, during, the, occupation, scap, successfully, if, not, entirely, abolished, many, of, the, financial, coalitions, known, as, the, zaibatsu, which, had, previously, monopolized, industry, eventually, looser, industrial, groupings, known, as, keiretsu, evolved, the, reforms, alarmed, many, in, the, u, s, departments, of, defense, and, state, who, believed, they, conflicted, with, the, prospect, of, japan, and, its, industrial, capacity, as, a, bulwark, against, the, spread, of, communism, in, asia, in, 1947, macarthur, invited, the, founder, and, first, executive, director, of, the, american, civil, liberties, union, aclu, roger, nash, baldwin, to, teach, the, japanese, government, and, people, about, civil, rights, and, civil, liberties, macarthur, also, asked, him, to, do, the, same, for, southern, korea, which, macarthur, was, responsible, for, when, it, was, under, u, s, army, occupation, macarthur, ignored, members, of, the, house, un, american, activities, committee, and, the, fbi, who, believed, that, baldwin, was, a, soviet, loving, communist, he, wanted, a, civil, liberties, expert, to, quickly, introduce, western, style, civil, rights, to, the, japanese, and, thought, conservatives, would, take, too, long, baldwin, helped, found, the, japan, civil, liberties, union, in, a, confidential, letter, to, aclu, leaders, the, anti, militarist, and, very, liberal, baldwin, said, about, macarthur, his, observation, on, civil, liberties, and, democracy, rank, with, the, best, i, ever, heard, from, any, civilian, and, they, were, incredible, from, a, general, japan, s, hereditary, peerage, called, kazoku, that, lasted, for, over, a, millennium, in, different, but, essentially, similar, forms, was, abolished, by, the, new, japanese, constitution, that, was, heavily, influenced, by, macarthur, this, was, similar, to, the, european, peerage, system, involving, princes, barons, and, counts, who, were, not, part, of, the, royal, family, also, the, extended, royal, family, called, ke, and, shinn, ke, was, abolished, and, stripped, of, all, rights, and, privileges, transforming, into, commoners, immediately, the, only, japanese, who, were, allowed, to, call, themselves, a, part, of, royalty, or, nobility, after, the, u, s, occupation, were, the, emperor, and, about, 20, of, his, direct, family, members, this, action, by, macarthur, and, the, writers, of, the, constitution, helped, transform, japan, drastically, by, abolishing, all, of, the, old, extended, royal, family, class, and, the, nobility, class, macarthur, ruled, japan, with, a, soft, handed, approach, he, legalized, the, japanese, communist, party, despite, reservations, from, the, united, states, government, out, of, a, desire, for, japan, to, be, truly, democratic, and, invited, them, to, take, part, in, the, 1946, election, which, was, also, the, first, ever, election, to, allow, women, to, vote, he, ordered, the, release, of, all, political, prisoners, of, the, imperial, japanese, era, including, communist, prisoners, the, first, may, day, parade, in, 11, years, in, 1946, was, greenlit, by, macarthur, also, on, the, day, before, the, may, day, celebrations, which, would, involve, 300, 000, japanese, communists, demonstrating, with, red, flags, and, pro, marxism, chants, in, front, of, the, tokyo, imperial, palace, and, the, dai, ichi, building, a, group, of, would, be, assassins, led, by, hideo, tokayama, who, planned, to, assassinate, macarthur, with, hand, grenades, and, pistols, on, may, day, were, stopped, and, some, of, its, members, were, arrested, despite, this, plot, the, may, day, demonstrations, went, on, macarthur, stopped, the, communist, party, from, gaining, any, popularity, in, japan, by, releasing, their, members, from, prison, conducting, landmark, land, reform, that, made, macarthur, more, popular, than, communism, for, the, rural, japanese, farmers, and, peasants, and, allowing, the, communists, to, freely, participate, in, elections, in, the, 1946, election, they, won, only, 6, seats, macarthur, was, also, in, charge, of, southern, korea, from, 1945, to, 1948, due, to, the, lack, of, clear, orders, or, initiative, from, washington, d, c, there, was, no, plan, or, guideline, given, to, macarthur, from, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, or, the, state, department, on, how, to, rule, korea, so, what, resulted, was, a, very, tumultuous, 3, year, military, occupation, that, led, to, the, creation, of, the, u, s, friendly, republic, of, korea, in, 1948, he, ordered, lieutenant, general, john, r, hodge, who, accepted, the, surrender, of, japanese, forces, in, southern, korea, in, september, 1945, to, govern, that, area, on, scap, s, behalf, and, report, to, him, in, tokyo, in, an, address, to, congress, on, 19, april, 1951, macarthur, declared, the, japanese, people, since, the, war, have, undergone, the, greatest, reformation, recorded, in, modern, history, with, a, commendable, will, eagerness, to, learn, and, marked, capacity, to, understand, they, have, from, the, ashes, left, in, war, s, wake, erected, in, japan, an, edifice, dedicated, to, the, supremacy, of, individual, liberty, and, personal, dignity, and, in, the, ensuing, process, there, has, been, created, a, truly, representative, government, committed, to, the, advance, of, political, morality, freedom, of, economic, enterprise, and, social, justice, macarthur, handed, over, power, to, the, japanese, government, in, 1949, but, remained, in, japan, until, relieved, by, president, harry, s, truman, on, 11, april, 1951, the, san, francisco, peace, treaty, signed, on, 8, september, 1951, marked, the, end, of, the, allied, occupation, and, when, it, went, into, effect, on, 28, april, 1952, japan, was, once, again, an, independent, state, in, 1948, macarthur, made, a, bid, to, win, the, republican, nomination, for, president, which, was, the, most, serious, of, several, efforts, he, made, over, the, years, macarthur, s, status, as, one, of, america, s, most, popular, war, heroes, together, with, his, reputation, as, the, statesman, who, had, transformed, japan, gave, him, a, strong, basis, for, running, for, president, but, macarthur, s, lack, of, connections, within, the, gop, were, a, major, handicap, macarthur, s, strongest, supporters, came, from, the, quasi, isolationist, midwestern, wing, of, the, republicans, and, embraced, men, such, as, brigadier, general, hanford, macnider, philip, la, follette, and, brigadier, general, robert, e, wood, a, diverse, collection, of, old, right, and, progressive, republicans, only, united, by, a, belief, that, the, u, s, was, too, much, involved, in, europe, for, its, own, good, macarthur, declined, to, campaign, for, the, presidency, himself, but, he, privately, encouraged, his, supporters, to, put, his, name, on, the, ballot, macarthur, had, always, stated, he, would, retire, when, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, with, japan, and, his, push, in, the, fall, of, 1947, to, have, the, u, s, sign, a, peace, treaty, with, japan, was, intended, to, allow, him, to, retire, on, a, high, note, and, thus, campaign, for, the, presidency, for, the, same, reasons, truman, subverted, macarthur, s, efforts, to, have, a, peace, treaty, signed, in, 1947, saying, that, more, time, was, needed, before, the, u, s, could, formally, make, peace, with, japan, truman, in, fact, was, so, worried, about, macarthur, becoming, president, that, in, 1947, he, asked, general, dwight, eisenhower, who, similar, to, truman, did, not, like, macarthur, either, to, run, for, president, and, truman, would, happily, be, his, running, mate, in, 1951, he, asked, eisenhower, again, to, run, to, stop, macarthur, eisenhower, asked, what, about, macarthur, truman, said, i, m, going, to, take, care, of, macarthur, you, ll, see, what, happens, to, macarthur, without, a, peace, treaty, macarthur, decided, not, to, resign, while, at, the, same, time, writing, letters, to, wood, saying, he, would, be, more, than, happy, to, accept, the, republican, nomination, if, it, were, offered, to, him, in, late, 1947, and, early, 1948, macarthur, received, several, republican, grandees, in, tokyo, on, 9, march, 1948, macarthur, issued, a, press, statement, declaring, his, interest, in, being, the, republican, nominee, for, president, saying, he, would, be, honored, if, the, republican, party, were, to, nominate, him, but, would, not, resign, from, the, army, to, campaign, for, the, presidency, the, press, statement, had, been, forced, by, wood, who, told, macarthur, that, it, was, impossible, to, campaign, for, a, man, who, was, not, officially, running, for, president, and, that, macarthur, could, either, declare, his, candidacy, or, see, wood, cease, campaigning, for, him, macarthur, s, supporters, made, a, major, effort, to, win, the, wisconsin, republican, primary, held, on, 6, april, 1948, macarthur, s, refusal, to, campaign, badly, hurt, his, chances, and, it, was, won, to, everybody, s, surprise, by, harold, stassen, the, defeat, in, wisconsin, followed, by, defeat, in, nebraska, effectively, ended, macarthur, s, chances, of, winning, the, republican, nomination, but, macarthur, refused, to, withdraw, his, name, until, the, 1948, republican, national, convention, at, which, governor, thomas, dewey, of, new, york, was, nominated, on, 25, june, 1950, north, korea, invaded, south, korea, starting, the, korean, war, the, united, nations, security, council, passed, in, quick, succession, resolution, 82, resolution, 83, resolution, 84, and, resolution, 85, which, authorized, a, united, nations, command, unc, force, to, assist, south, korea, the, un, empowered, the, american, government, to, select, a, commander, and, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, unanimously, recommended, macarthur, he, therefore, became, commander, in, chief, of, the, unc, while, remaining, scap, in, japan, and, commander, in, chief, far, east, all, south, korean, forces, were, placed, under, his, command, as, they, retreated, before, the, north, korean, onslaught, macarthur, received, permission, to, commit, u, s, ground, forces, all, the, first, units, to, arrive, could, do, was, trade, men, and, ground, for, time, falling, back, to, the, pusan, perimeter, by, the, end, of, august, the, crisis, subsided, north, korean, attacks, on, the, perimeter, had, tapered, off, while, the, north, korean, force, numbered, 88, 000, troops, lieutenant, general, walton, walker, s, eighth, army, now, numbered, 180, 000, and, he, had, more, tanks, and, artillery, pieces, in, 1949, the, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, general, of, the, army, omar, bradley, had, predicted, that, large, scale, combined, amphibious, operations, will, never, occur, again, but, by, july, 1950, macarthur, was, planning, just, such, an, operation, macarthur, compared, his, plan, with, that, of, general, james, wolfe, at, the, battle, of, the, plains, of, abraham, and, brushed, aside, the, problems, of, tides, hydrography, and, terrain, in, september, despite, lingering, concerns, from, superiors, macarthur, s, soldiers, and, marines, made, a, successful, landing, at, inchon, deep, behind, north, korean, lines, launched, with, naval, and, close, air, support, the, landing, outflanked, the, north, koreans, recaptured, seoul, and, forced, them, to, retreat, northward, in, disarray, visiting, the, battlefield, on, 17, september, macarthur, surveyed, six, t, 34, tanks, that, had, been, knocked, out, by, marines, ignoring, sniper, fire, around, him, except, to, note, that, the, north, korean, marksmen, were, poorly, trained, on, 11, september, truman, issued, an, order, nsc, 81, 1, to, macarthur, and, un, forces, for, an, advance, beyond, the, 38th, parallel, into, north, korea, truman, secretary, of, state, dean, acheson, secretary, of, defense, george, marshall, u, s, ambassador, to, the, un, warren, r, austin, and, the, british, and, french, governments, all, agreed, on, the, decision, to, invade, and, occupy, all, of, north, korea, macarthur, busy, with, the, pusan, perimeter, defense, and, the, upcoming, inchon, landings, had, nothing, to, do, with, this, decision, there, was, controversy, over, whether, u, s, troops, should, cross, the, 38th, parallel, with, only, the, approval, from, the, u, s, government, nsc, 81, 1, was, solely, a, u, s, order, because, the, original, un, resolution, only, called, for, the, restoration, of, south, korea, below, the, 38th, parallel, macarthur, was, very, hesitant, about, advancing, north, of, the, 38th, parallel, and, waited, for, further, instructions, marshall, ordered, macarthur, on, 30, september, to, feel, unhampered, tactically, and, strategically, to, proceed, north, of, 38th, parallel, this, ambiguity, was, finally, resolved, by, the, un, general, assembly, greenlighting, macarthur, to, advance, northward, on, 4, october, with, resolution, 376, v, which, authorized, him, and, un, forces, to, cross, the, 38th, parallel, and, to, unify, all, of, korea, under, the, republic, of, korea, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, on, 7, october, further, clarified, to, macarthur, that, the, official, mandate, for, un, forces, was, the, unification, of, a, democratic, korea, macarthur, now, planned, another, amphibious, assault, on, wonsan, on, the, east, coast, but, it, fell, to, south, korean, troops, before, the, 1st, marine, division, could, reach, it, by, sea, in, october, macarthur, met, with, truman, at, the, wake, island, conference, with, truman, emulating, roosevelt, s, wartime, meeting, with, macarthur, in, hawaii, the, president, awarded, macarthur, his, fifth, distinguished, service, medal, briefly, questioned, about, the, chinese, threat, macarthur, dismissed, it, saying, that, he, hoped, to, be, able, to, withdraw, the, eighth, army, to, japan, by, christmas, and, to, release, a, division, for, service, in, europe, in, january, he, regarded, the, possibility, of, soviet, intervention, as, a, more, serious, threat, on, 20, october, macarthur, flew, to, the, sukchon, sunchon, area, of, north, korea, north, of, pyongyang, to, supervise, and, observe, an, airborne, operation, by, the, 187th, airborne, regimental, combat, team, this, was, the, first, of, two, airborne, operations, done, by, un, forces, during, the, korean, war, macarthur, s, unarmed, airplane, was, subject, to, attack, by, enemy, aircraft, known, to, be, based, at, sinuiju, macarthur, received, a, distinguished, flying, cross, for, supervising, the, operation, in, person, a, month, later, things, had, changed, the, enemy, were, engaged, by, the, un, forces, at, the, battle, of, unsan, in, late, october, which, demonstrated, the, presence, of, chinese, soldiers, in, korea, and, rendered, significant, losses, to, the, american, and, other, un, troops, nevertheless, willoughby, downplayed, the, evidence, about, chinese, intervention, in, the, war, he, estimated, that, up, to, 71, 000, chinese, soldiers, were, in, the, country, while, the, true, number, was, closer, to, 300, 000, he, was, not, alone, in, this, miscalculation, on, 24, november, the, central, intelligence, agency, reported, to, truman, that, while, there, could, be, as, many, as, 200, 000, chinese, troops, in, korea, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, chinese, communists, plan, major, offensive, operations, that, day, macarthur, flew, to, walker, s, headquarters, and, he, later, wrote, for, five, hours, i, toured, the, front, lines, in, talking, to, a, group, of, officers, i, told, them, of, general, bradley, s, desire, and, hope, to, have, two, divisions, home, by, christmas, what, i, had, seen, at, the, front, line, worried, me, greatly, the, r, o, k, troops, were, not, yet, in, good, shape, and, the, entire, line, was, deplorably, weak, in, numbers, if, the, chinese, were, actually, in, heavy, force, i, decided, i, would, withdraw, our, troops, and, abandon, any, attempt, to, move, north, i, decided, to, reconnoiter, and, try, to, see, with, my, own, eyes, and, interpret, with, my, own, long, experience, what, was, going, on, macarthur, flew, over, the, front, line, himself, in, his, douglas, c, 54, skymaster, but, saw, no, signs, of, a, chinese, build, up, and, therefore, decided, to, wait, before, ordering, an, advance, or, withdrawal, evidence, of, the, chinese, activity, was, hidden, to, macarthur, the, chinese, army, traveled, at, night, and, dug, in, during, the, day, for, his, reconnaissance, efforts, macarthur, was, nonetheless, awarded, the, honorary, combat, pilot, s, wings, china, considered, the, un, offensive, to, its, border, a, serious, threat, to, its, security, china, s, fears, of, an, invasion, were, reinforced, by, macarthur, s, public, statements, that, he, wanted, to, conventionally, bomb, but, not, invade, china, and, use, kuomintang, forces, stationed, in, formosa, to, augment, un, forces, in, the, korean, peninsula, in, response, to, china, first, initiating, hostile, actions, against, un, troops, in, non, chinese, territory, north, korea, during, october, and, november, macarthur, was, banned, by, truman, from, sending, any, airplanes, even, reconnaissance, planes, over, chinese, territory, and, his, air, force, and, navy, pilots, complained, to, him, about, chinese, and, also, very, likely, soviet, jets, illegally, attacking, them, across, the, yalu, river, inside, north, korean, territory, while, un, planes, were, bombing, north, korean, infrastructure, south, of, the, yalu, for, the, purpose, of, domestic, mobilization, the, chinese, government, lied, about, how, the, war, started, by, falsely, claiming, macarthur, initiated, the, hostilities, when, he, landed, his, troops, at, inchon, the, theory, that, chinese, leader, mao, zedong, only, entered, the, war, because, of, macarthur, s, yalu, offensive, and, comments, has, been, accepted, without, question, for, many, decades, after, the, korean, war, however, recent, research, from, historian, arthur, l, herman, and, others, in, the, 2010s, citing, evidence, from, chinese, historical, archives, showed, that, mao, actually, planned, on, directly, intervening, in, the, korean, war, ever, since, july, 1950, when, the, first, american, soldiers, landed, in, south, korea, long, before, the, inchon, and, yalu, battles, and, long, before, macarthur, s, public, statements, regarding, taiwan, and, china, in, late, august, 1950, the, chinese, were, planning, to, get, involved, in, korea, with, or, without, macarthur, s, yalu, offensive, in, fact, china, had, already, indirectly, intervened, in, the, beginning, of, the, korean, war, by, transferring, 69, 200, people, s, liberation, army, soldiers, who, were, chinese, citizens, with, korean, ethnicity, to, the, north, korean, korean, people, s, army, in, 1949, 50, these, three, chinese, army, divisions, that, were, transferred, to, north, korea, were, the, 156th, division, 164th, division, and, 166th, division, these, former, chinese, soldiers, turned, north, korean, soldiers, made, up, 47, of, north, korea, s, 148, 680, man, army, by, june, 1950, on, 25, november, 1950, walker, s, eighth, army, was, attacked, by, the, chinese, army, and, soon, the, un, forces, were, in, retreat, macarthur, provided, the, chief, of, staff, general, j, lawton, collins, with, a, series, of, nine, successive, withdrawal, lines, on, 23, december, walker, was, killed, when, his, jeep, collided, with, a, truck, and, was, replaced, by, lieutenant, general, matthew, ridgway, whom, macarthur, had, selected, in, case, of, such, an, eventuality, ridgway, noted, that, macarthur, s, prestige, which, had, gained, an, extraordinary, luster, after, inchon, was, badly, tarnished, his, credibility, suffered, in, the, unforeseen, outcome, of, the, november, offensive, collins, discussed, the, possible, use, of, nuclear, weapons, in, korea, with, macarthur, in, december, and, later, asked, him, for, a, list, of, targets, in, the, soviet, union, in, case, it, entered, the, war, macarthur, testified, before, congress, in, 1951, that, he, had, never, recommended, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, and, considered, but, did, not, recommend, a, plan, to, cut, off, north, korea, with, radioactive, poisons, although, he, broached, the, latter, with, eisenhower, then, president, elect, in, 1952, in, 1954, in, an, interview, published, after, his, death, he, stated, he, had, wanted, to, drop, atomic, bombs, on, enemy, bases, explaining, that, i, would, have, dropped, between, 30, and, 50, atomic, bombs, on, his, air, bases, and, other, depots, strung, across, the, neck, of, manchuria, from, just, across, the, yalu, river, from, antung, northwestern, tip, of, korea, to, the, neighborhood, of, hunchun, just, north, of, the, northeastern, tip, of, korea, near, the, border, of, the, u, s, s, r, in, 1960, he, challenged, a, statement, by, truman, that, he, had, advocated, using, atomic, bombs, truman, issued, a, retraction, stating, that, he, had, no, evidence, of, the, claim, it, was, merely, his, personal, opinion, in, january, 1951, macarthur, refused, to, entertain, proposals, for, the, forward, deployment, of, nuclear, weapons, to, cover, a, un, retreat, in, korea, as, proposed, by, truman, in, april, 1951, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, drafted, orders, for, macarthur, authorizing, nuclear, attacks, on, manchuria, and, the, shandong, peninsula, if, the, chinese, launched, airstrikes, originating, from, there, against, his, forces, the, next, day, truman, met, with, the, chairman, of, the, united, states, atomic, energy, commission, gordon, dean, and, arranged, for, the, transfer, of, nine, mark, 4, nuclear, bombs, to, military, control, dean, was, apprehensive, about, delegating, the, decision, on, how, they, should, be, used, to, macarthur, who, lacked, expert, technical, knowledge, of, the, weapons, and, their, effects, the, joint, chiefs, were, not, entirely, comfortable, about, giving, them, to, macarthur, either, for, fear, that, he, might, prematurely, carry, out, his, orders, instead, they, decided, that, the, nuclear, strike, force, would, report, to, the, strategic, air, command, within, weeks, of, the, chinese, attack, macarthur, was, forced, to, retreat, from, north, korea, seoul, fell, in, january, 1951, and, both, truman, and, macarthur, were, forced, to, contemplate, the, prospect, of, abandoning, korea, entirely, european, countries, did, not, share, macarthur, s, world, view, distrusted, his, judgment, and, were, afraid, that, he, might, use, his, stature, and, influence, with, the, american, public, to, re, focus, american, policy, away, from, europe, and, towards, asia, they, were, concerned, that, this, might, lead, to, a, major, war, with, china, possibly, involving, nuclear, weapons, since, in, february, 1950, the, soviet, union, and, china, had, signed, a, defensive, alliance, committing, each, to, go, to, war, if, the, other, party, was, attacked, the, possibility, that, an, american, attack, on, china, would, cause, world, war, iii, was, considered, to, be, very, real, at, the, time, in, a, visit, to, the, united, states, in, december, 1950, the, british, prime, minister, clement, attlee, had, raised, the, fears, of, the, british, and, other, european, governments, that, general, macarthur, was, running, the, show, under, ridgway, s, command, the, eighth, army, pressed, north, again, in, january, he, inflicted, heavy, casualties, on, the, chinese, recaptured, seoul, in, march, 1951, and, pushed, on, to, the, 38th, parallel, with, the, improved, military, situation, truman, now, saw, the, opportunity, to, offer, a, negotiated, peace, but, on, 24, march, macarthur, called, upon, china, to, admit, that, it, had, been, defeated, simultaneously, challenging, both, the, chinese, and, his, own, superiors, truman, s, proposed, announcement, was, shelved, on, 5, april, representative, joseph, william, martin, jr, the, republican, leader, in, the, house, of, representatives, read, aloud, on, the, floor, of, the, house, a, letter, from, macarthur, critical, of, truman, s, europe, first, policy, and, limited, war, strategy, the, letter, concluded, with, it, seems, strangely, difficult, for, some, to, realize, that, here, in, asia, is, where, the, communist, conspirators, have, elected, to, make, their, play, for, global, conquest, and, that, we, have, joined, the, issue, thus, raised, on, the, battlefield, that, here, we, fight, europe, s, war, with, arms, while, the, diplomats, there, still, fight, it, with, words, that, if, we, lose, the, war, to, communism, in, asia, the, fall, of, europe, is, inevitable, win, it, and, europe, most, probably, would, avoid, war, and, yet, preserve, freedom, as, you, pointed, out, we, must, win, there, is, no, substitute, for, victory, in, march, 1951, secret, united, states, intercepts, of, diplomatic, dispatches, disclosed, clandestine, conversations, from, spanish, and, portuguese, diplomats, in, tokyo, embassies, to, their, home, countries, in, which, they, claimed, that, macarthur, expressed, confidence, to, them, that, he, would, succeed, in, disposing, of, the, chinese, communist, question, once, and, for, all, this, conversation, log, did, not, record, macarthur, saying, this, but, spanish, and, portuguese, diplomats, claiming, that, macarthur, said, that, when, these, alleged, claims, from, the, diplomats, came, to, the, attention, of, president, truman, he, was, enraged, to, learn, that, macarthur, was, supposedly, not, only, trying, to, increase, public, support, for, his, position, on, conducting, the, war, but, had, secretly, informed, foreign, governments, that, he, planned, to, initiate, actions, that, were, counter, to, united, states, policy, the, president, was, unable, to, act, immediately, since, he, could, not, afford, to, reveal, the, existence, of, the, intercepts, and, because, of, macarthur, s, popularity, with, the, public, and, political, support, in, congress, however, following, the, release, on, 5, april, by, representative, martin, of, macarthur, s, letter, truman, concluded, he, could, relieve, macarthur, of, his, commands, without, incurring, unacceptable, political, damage, truman, summoned, secretary, of, defense, george, marshall, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, omar, bradley, secretary, of, state, dean, acheson, and, averell, harriman, to, discuss, what, to, do, about, macarthur, they, concurred, macarthur, should, be, relieved, of, his, command, but, made, no, recommendation, to, do, so, although, they, felt, that, it, was, correct, from, a, purely, military, point, of, view, they, were, aware, that, there, were, important, political, considerations, as, well, truman, and, acheson, agreed, that, macarthur, was, insubordinate, but, the, joint, chiefs, avoided, any, suggestion, of, this, insubordination, was, a, military, offense, and, macarthur, could, have, requested, a, public, court, martial, similar, to, that, of, billy, mitchell, the, outcome, of, such, a, trial, was, uncertain, and, it, might, well, have, found, him, not, guilty, and, ordered, his, reinstatement, the, joint, chiefs, agreed, that, there, was, little, evidence, that, general, macarthur, had, ever, failed, to, carry, out, a, direct, order, of, the, joint, chiefs, or, acted, in, opposition, to, an, order, in, point, of, fact, bradley, insisted, macarthur, had, stretched, but, not, legally, violated, any, jcs, directives, he, had, violated, the, president, s, 6, december, directive, relayed, to, him, by, the, jcs, but, this, did, not, constitute, violation, of, a, jcs, order, truman, ordered, macarthur, s, relief, by, ridgway, and, the, order, went, out, on, 10, april, with, bradley, s, signature, in, a, 3, december, 1973, article, in, time, magazine, truman, was, quoted, as, saying, in, the, early, 1960s, i, fired, him, because, he, wouldn, t, respect, the, authority, of, the, president, i, didn, t, fire, him, because, he, was, a, dumb, son, of, a, bitch, although, he, was, but, that, s, not, against, the, law, for, generals, if, it, was, half, to, three, quarters, of, them, would, be, in, jail, the, relief, of, the, famous, general, by, the, unpopular, politician, created, a, storm, of, public, controversy, polls, showed, that, the, majority, of, the, public, disapproved, of, the, decision, to, relieve, macarthur, by, february, 1952, almost, nine, months, later, truman, s, approval, rating, had, fallen, to, 22, percent, as, of, 2023, that, remains, the, lowest, gallup, poll, approval, rating, recorded, by, any, serving, president, as, the, increasingly, unpopular, war, in, korea, dragged, on, truman, s, administration, was, beset, with, a, series, of, corruption, scandals, and, he, eventually, decided, not, to, run, for, re, election, beginning, on, 3, may, 1951, a, joint, senate, committee, chaired, by, democrat, richard, russell, jr, investigated, macarthur, s, removal, it, concluded, that, the, removal, of, general, macarthur, was, within, the, constitutional, powers, of, the, president, but, the, circumstances, were, a, shock, to, national, pride, a, day, after, his, arrival, in, san, francisco, from, korea, on, 18, april, 1951, macarthur, flew, with, his, family, to, washington, d, c, where, he, was, scheduled, to, address, a, joint, session, of, congress, it, was, his, and, jean, s, first, visit, to, the, continental, united, states, since, 1937, when, they, had, been, married, arthur, iv, now, aged, 13, had, never, been, to, the, u, s, on, 19, april, macarthur, made, his, last, official, appearance, in, a, farewell, address, to, the, u, s, congress, presenting, and, defending, his, side, of, his, disagreement, with, truman, over, the, conduct, of, the, korean, war, during, his, speech, he, was, interrupted, by, fifty, ovations, macarthur, ended, the, address, saying, i, am, closing, my, 52, years, of, military, service, when, i, joined, the, army, even, before, the, turn, of, the, century, it, was, the, fulfillment, of, all, of, my, boyish, hopes, and, dreams, the, world, has, turned, over, many, times, since, i, took, the, oath, on, the, plain, at, west, point, and, the, hopes, and, dreams, have, long, since, vanished, but, i, still, remember, the, refrain, of, one, of, the, most, popular, barrack, ballads, of, that, day, which, proclaimed, most, proudly, that, old, soldiers, never, die, they, just, fade, away, and, like, the, old, soldier, of, that, ballad, i, now, close, my, military, career, and, just, fade, away, an, old, soldier, who, tried, to, do, his, duty, as, god, gave, him, the, light, to, see, that, duty, good, bye, macarthur, received, public, adulation, which, aroused, expectations, that, he, would, run, for, president, but, he, was, not, a, candidate, he, carried, out, a, speaking, tour, in, 1951, 52, attacking, the, truman, administration, for, appeasement, in, asia, and, for, mismanaging, the, economy, initially, attracting, large, crowds, by, early, 1952, macarthur, s, speeches, were, attracting, smaller, and, smaller, numbers, of, people, as, many, complained, that, macarthur, seemed, more, interested, in, settling, scores, with, truman, and, praising, himself, than, in, offering, up, a, constructive, vision, for, the, nation, macarthur, felt, uncomfortable, campaigning, for, the, republican, nomination, and, hoped, that, at, the, 1952, republican, national, convention, a, deadlock, would, ensue, between, senator, robert, a, taft, and, general, dwight, eisenhower, for, the, presidential, nomination, macarthur, s, plan, was, to, then, step, in, and, offer, himself, as, a, compromise, candidate, potentially, picking, taft, as, a, running, mate, his, unwillingness, to, campaign, for, the, nomination, seriously, hurt, his, viability, as, a, candidate, in, the, end, macarthur, endorsed, taft, and, was, keynote, speaker, at, the, convention, taft, ultimately, lost, the, nomination, to, eisenhower, who, went, on, to, win, the, general, election, in, a, landslide, once, elected, eisenhower, consulted, with, macarthur, his, former, commanding, officer, about, ending, the, war, in, korea, douglas, and, jean, macarthur, spent, their, last, years, together, in, the, penthouse, of, the, waldorf, towers, a, part, of, the, waldorf, astoria, hotel, he, was, elected, chairman, of, the, board, of, remington, rand, in, 1952, in, that, year, he, earned, a, salary, of, 68, 000, as, well, as, 20, 000, pay, and, allowances, as, a, general, of, the, army, equivalent, to, 627, 000, and, 184, 000, in, 2023, respectively, the, waldorf, became, the, setting, for, an, annual, birthday, party, on, 26, january, thrown, by, the, general, s, former, deputy, chief, engineer, major, general, leif, j, sverdrup, at, the, 1960, celebration, for, macarthur, s, 80th, birthday, many, of, his, friends, were, startled, by, the, general, s, obviously, deteriorating, health, the, next, day, he, collapsed, and, was, rushed, into, surgery, at, st, luke, s, hospital, to, control, a, severely, swollen, prostate, in, june, 1960, he, was, decorated, by, the, japanese, government, with, the, grand, cordon, of, the, order, of, the, rising, sun, with, paulownia, flowers, the, highest, japanese, order, which, may, be, conferred, on, an, individual, who, is, not, a, head, of, state, in, his, statement, upon, receiving, the, honor, macarthur, said, no, honor, i, have, ever, received, moves, me, more, deeply, than, this, one, perhaps, this, is, because, i, can, recall, no, parallel, in, the, history, of, the, world, where, a, great, nation, recently, at, war, has, so, distinguished, its, former, enemy, commander, what, makes, it, even, more, poignant, is, my, own, firm, disbelief, in, the, usefulness, of, military, occupations, with, their, corresponding, displacement, of, civil, control, after, his, recovery, macarthur, methodically, began, to, prepare, for, his, death, he, visited, the, white, house, for, a, final, reunion, with, eisenhower, in, 1961, to, commemorate, the, fifteenth, anniversary, of, filipino, independence, an, eighty, one, year, old, macarthur, made, a, sentimental, journey, to, the, philippines, where, he, was, decorated, by, president, carlos, p, garcia, with, the, philippine, legion, of, honor, and, met, with, cheering, crowds, macarthur, also, accepted, an, advance, of, 900, 000, equivalent, to, 7, 03, million, in, 2023, from, henry, luce, for, the, rights, to, his, memoirs, and, wrote, the, volume, that, would, eventually, be, published, as, reminiscences, sections, began, to, appear, in, serialized, form, in, life, magazine, in, the, months, before, his, death, president, john, f, kennedy, solicited, macarthur, s, counsel, in, 1961, and, 1962, the, first, of, three, meetings, was, held, shortly, after, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, macarthur, was, extremely, critical, of, the, military, advice, given, to, kennedy, and, cautioned, the, young, president, to, avoid, a, u, s, military, build, up, in, vietnam, pointing, out, that, domestic, problems, should, be, given, a, much, greater, priority, macarthur, later, gave, similar, advice, to, president, lyndon, b, johnson, in, august, 1962, kennedy, summoned, macarthur, for, counsel, at, the, white, house, while, macarthur, met, members, of, congress, in, washington, after, kennedy, received, intelligence, that, the, soviets, were, preparing, to, transport, nuclear, weapons, to, cuba, the, greatest, weapon, of, war, is, the, blockade, macarthur, advised, kennedy, after, a, long, conversation, about, how, to, deal, with, the, soviets, and, chinese, if, war, comes, that, is, the, weapon, we, should, use, kennedy, used, the, naval, blockade, option, during, the, cuban, missile, crisis, two, months, later, thanks, to, macarthur, s, advice, kennedy, heavily, trusted, macarthur, because, whenever, he, was, urged, to, increase, u, s, involvement, in, laos, and, vietnam, by, generals, politicians, and, advisors, he, would, tell, them, well, now, you, gentlemen, you, go, back, and, convince, general, macarthur, then, i, ll, be, convinced, in, 1962, west, point, honored, the, increasingly, frail, macarthur, with, the, sylvanus, thayer, award, for, outstanding, service, to, the, nation, which, had, gone, to, eisenhower, the, year, before, macarthur, s, speech, to, the, cadets, in, accepting, the, award, had, as, its, theme, duty, honor, country, the, shadows, are, lengthening, for, me, the, twilight, is, here, my, days, of, old, have, vanished, tone, and, tint, they, have, gone, glimmering, through, the, dreams, of, things, that, were, their, memory, is, one, of, wondrous, beauty, watered, by, tears, and, coaxed, and, caressed, by, the, smiles, of, yesterday, i, listen, vainly, but, with, thirsty, ears, for, the, witching, melody, of, faint, bugles, blowing, reveille, of, far, drums, beating, the, long, roll, in, my, dreams, i, hear, again, the, crash, of, guns, the, rattle, of, musketry, the, strange, mournful, mutter, of, the, battlefield, but, in, the, evening, of, my, memory, always, i, come, back, to, west, point, always, there, echoes, and, re, echoes, duty, honor, country, today, marks, my, final, roll, call, with, you, but, i, want, you, to, know, that, when, i, cross, the, river, my, last, conscious, thoughts, will, be, of, the, corps, and, the, corps, and, the, corps, i, bid, you, farewell, in, august, 1962, macarthur, returned, to, washington, d, c, to, receive, a, special, honor, from, a, joint, session, of, congress, called, the, thanks, of, congress, congress, unanimously, passed, a, special, resolution, to, give, him, this, award, this, was, his, first, trip, to, congress, since, april, 1951, after, he, was, relieved, he, received, an, engrossed, copy, of, the, resolution, that, honored, him, for, his, military, leadership, during, and, following, world, war, ii, and, also, for, his, many, years, of, effort, to, strengthen, the, ties, between, the, philippines, and, the, united, states, this, honor, is, unique, in, that, it, dates, back, to, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, has, rarely, been, given, to, anybody, after, the, civil, war, two, months, later, macarthur, was, awarded, the, congressional, gold, medal, that, honored, his, gallant, service, to, his, country, in, 1963, president, kennedy, asked, macarthur, to, help, mediate, a, dispute, between, the, national, collegiate, athletic, association, and, the, amateur, athletic, union, over, control, of, track, sports, in, the, country, the, dispute, threatened, to, derail, the, participation, of, the, united, states, in, the, 1964, summer, olympics, his, presence, helped, to, broker, a, deal, and, participation, in, the, games, went, on, as, planned, douglas, macarthur, died, at, walter, reed, army, medical, center, on, 5, april, 1964, of, primary, biliary, cholangitis, kennedy, had, authorized, a, state, funeral, before, his, own, death, in, 1963, and, johnson, confirmed, the, directive, ordering, that, macarthur, be, buried, with, all, the, honor, a, grateful, nation, can, bestow, on, a, departed, hero, on, 7, april, his, body, was, taken, to, new, york, city, where, it, lay, in, an, open, casket, at, the, park, avenue, armory, for, about, 12, hours, that, night, it, was, taken, by, train, to, washington, union, station, and, transported, by, a, funeral, procession, to, the, capitol, where, it, lay, in, state, at, the, united, states, capitol, rotunda, an, estimated, 150, 000, people, filed, by, the, bier, macarthur, had, requested, to, be, buried, in, norfolk, virginia, where, his, mother, had, been, born, and, where, his, parents, had, married, on, 11, april, his, funeral, service, was, held, in, st, paul, s, episcopal, church, in, norfolk, and, his, body, was, laid, to, rest, in, the, rotunda, of, the, norfolk, city, hall, in, 1960, the, mayor, of, norfolk, had, proposed, using, funds, raised, by, public, contribution, to, remodel, the, old, norfolk, city, hall, as, a, memorial, to, general, macarthur, and, as, a, repository, for, his, papers, decorations, and, mementos, restored, and, remodeled, the, macarthur, memorial, consists, of, a, complex, of, three, buildings, on, macarthur, square, containing, nine, museum, galleries, whose, contents, reflect, the, general, s, 50, years, of, military, service, at, the, heart, of, the, memorial, is, a, rotunda, in, its, center, lies, a, sunken, circular, crypt, with, two, marble, sarcophagi, one, for, macarthur, the, other, for, jean, who, continued, to, live, in, the, waldorf, towers, until, her,

macarthur, to, be, a, hero, who, saved, the, country, twice, once, in, 1945, and, once, in, 1950, the, city, of, incheon, erected, a, statue, of, macarthur, in, jayu, park, in, 1957, which, is, considered, a, symbol, of, patriotism, the, dai, ichi, seimei, building, in, tokyo, has, preserved, macarthur, s, 6th, floor, office, as, it, was, from, 1945, to, 1951, during, his, tenure, as, supreme, commander, for, the, allied, powers, macarthur, has, a, contested, legacy, in, the, philippines, in, 1942, he, suffered, a, defeat, that, gavin, long, described, as, the, greatest, in, the, history, of, american, foreign, wars, despite, this, in, a, fragile, period, of, the, american, psyche, when, the, general, american, public, still, stunned, by, the, shock, of, pearl, harbor, and, uncertain, what, lay, ahead, in, europe, desperately, needed, a, hero, they, wholeheartedly, embraced, douglas, macarthur, good, press, copy, that, he, was, there, simply, were, no, other, choices, that, came, close, to, matching, his, mystique, not, to, mention, his, evocative, lone, wolf, stand, something, that, has, always, resonated, with, americans, he, is, highly, respected, and, remembered, to, the, present, day, in, the, philippines, and, japan, in, 1961, macarthur, traveled, to, manila, one, final, time, and, was, greeted, by, a, cheering, crowd, of, two, million, macarthur, s, concept, of, the, role, of, the, soldier, as, including, civil, affairs, quelling, riots, and, low, level, conflict, was, dismissed, by, the, majority, of, officers, who, had, fought, in, europe, during, world, war, ii, and, afterwards, saw, the, army, s, role, as, fighting, the, soviet, union, unlike, them, in, his, victories, in, new, guinea, in, 1944, the, philippines, in, 1945, and, korea, in, 1950, he, fought, outnumbered, and, relied, on, maneuver, and, surprise, for, success, the, american, sinologist, john, king, fairbank, called, macarthur, our, greatest, soldier, british, field, marshal, viscount, alanbrooke, the, chief, of, britain, s, imperial, general, staff, had, stated, that, macarthur, outshone, all, of, his, contemporary, american, and, british, generals, much, to, the, concurring, of, b, h, liddell, hart, and, espoused, that, the, blend, of, his, strong, personality, along, with, his, grasp, of, tactics, operative, mobility, and, vision, had, put, him, in, such, class, on, par, with, or, even, greater, than, genghis, khan, and, napoleon, bonaparte, president, of, the, republic, of, china, chiang, kai, shek, praised, him, a, glory, of, the, u, s, as, well, as, all, people, who, defend, freedom, and, justice, on, the, other, hand, truman, once, remarked, that, he, did, not, understand, how, the, u, s, army, could, produce, men, such, as, robert, e, lee, john, j, pershing, eisenhower, and, bradley, and, at, the, same, time, produce, custers, pattons, and, macarthur, his, relief, of, macarthur, cast, a, long, shadow, over, american, civil, military, relations, for, decades, when, lyndon, johnson, met, with, william, westmoreland, in, honolulu, in, 1966, he, told, him, general, i, have, a, lot, riding, on, you, i, hope, you, don, t, pull, a, macarthur, on, me, macarthur, s, relief, left, a, lasting, current, of, popular, sentiment, that, in, matters, of, war, and, peace, the, military, really, knows, best, a, philosophy, which, became, known, as, macarthurism, macarthur, remains, a, controversial, and, enigmatic, figure, he, has, been, portrayed, as, a, reactionary, although, he, was, in, many, respects, ahead, of, his, time, he, championed, a, progressive, approach, to, the, reconstruction, of, japan, arguing, that, all, occupations, ultimately, ended, badly, he, was, often, out, of, step, with, his, contemporaries, such, as, in, 1941, when, he, contended, that, nazi, germany, could, not, defeat, the, soviet, union, when, he, argued, that, north, korea, and, china, were, no, mere, soviet, puppets, and, throughout, his, career, in, his, insistence, that, the, future, lay, in, the, far, east, as, such, macarthur, implicitly, rejected, white, american, contemporary, notions, of, racial, superiority, he, always, treated, filipino, and, japanese, leaders, with, respect, as, equals, at, the, same, time, his, victorian, sensibilities, recoiled, at, leveling, manila, with, aerial, bombing, an, attitude, the, world, war, ii, generation, regarded, as, old, fashioned, when, asked, about, macarthur, blamey, said, the, best, and, the, worst, things, you, hear, about, him, are, both, true, macarthur, was, quoted, by, justice, betty, ellerin, of, the, appellate, division, of, the, supreme, court, of, the, state, of, new, york, first, department, in, the, 23, july, 1987, decision, on, the, case, dallas, parks, respondent, v, george, steinbrenner, et, al, appellants, the, quote, used, was, about, him, being, proud, to, have, protected, american, freedoms, like, the, freedom, to, boo, the, umpire, during, his, lifetime, macarthur, earned, over, 100, military, decorations, from, the, u, s, and, other, countries, including, the, medal, of, honor, the, french, legion, of, honour,
