operas, or, as, some, of, his, mature, works, were, later, known, music, dramas, unlike, most, opera, composers, wagner, wrote, both, the, libretto, and, the, music, for, each, of, his, stage, works, initially, establishing, his, reputation, as, a, composer, of, works, in, the, romantic, vein, of, carl, maria, von, weber, and, giacomo, meyerbeer, wagner, revolutionised, opera, through, his, concept, of, the, gesamtkunstwerk, total, work, of, art, by, which, he, sought, to, synthesise, the, poetic, visual, musical, and, dramatic, arts, with, music, subsidiary, to, drama, he, described, this, vision, in, a, series, of, essays, published, between, 1849, and, 1852, wagner, realised, these, ideas, most, fully, in, the, first, half, of, the, four, opera, cycle, der, ring, des, nibelungen, the, ring, of, the, nibelung, his, compositions, particularly, those, of, his, later, period, are, notable, for, their, complex, textures, rich, harmonies, and, orchestration, and, the, elaborate, use, of, leitmotifs, musical, phrases, associated, with, individual, characters, places, ideas, or, plot, elements, his, advances, in, musical, language, such, as, extreme, chromaticism, and, quickly, shifting, tonal, centres, greatly, influenced, the, development, of, classical, music, his, tristan, und, isolde, is, sometimes, described, as, marking, the, start, of, modern, music, wagner, had, his, own, opera, house, built, the, bayreuth, festspielhaus, which, embodied, many, novel, design, features, the, ring, and, parsifal, were, premiered, here, and, his, most, important, stage, works, continue, to, be, performed, at, the, annual, bayreuth, festival, which, was, galvanized, by, the, efforts, of, his, wife, cosima, wagner, and, the, family, s, descendants, his, thoughts, on, the, relative, contributions, of, music, and, drama, in, opera, were, to, change, again, and, he, reintroduced, some, traditional, forms, into, his, last, few, stage, works, including, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, the, mastersingers, of, nuremberg, until, his, final, years, wagner, s, life, was, characterised, by, political, exile, turbulent, love, affairs, poverty, and, repeated, flight, from, his, creditors, his, controversial, writings, on, music, drama, and, politics, have, attracted, extensive, comment, particularly, since, the, late, 20th, century, as, they, express, antisemitic, sentiments, the, effect, of, his, ideas, can, be, traced, in, many, of, the, arts, throughout, the, 20th, century, his, influence, spread, beyond, composition, into, conducting, philosophy, literature, the, visual, arts, and, theatre, richard, wagner, was, born, on, 22, may, 1813, to, an, ethnic, german, family, in, leipzig, then, part, of, the, confederation, of, the, rhine,

known, as, wilhelm, richard, geyer, he, almost, certainly, thought, that, geyer, was, his, biological, father, geyer, s, love, of, the, theatre, came, to, be, shared, by, his, stepson, and, wagner, took, part, in, his, performances, in, his, autobiography, mein, leben, wagner, recalled, once, playing, the, part, of, an, angel, in, late, 1820, wagner, was, enrolled, at, pastor, wetzel, s, school,

overtures, by, ear, following, geyer, s, death, in, 1821, richard, was, sent, to, the, kreuzschule, the, boarding, school, of, the, dresdner, kreuzchor, at, the, expense, of, geyer, s, brother, at, the, age, of, nine, he, was, hugely, impressed, by, the, gothic, elements, of, carl, maria, von, weber, s, opera, der, freisch, tz, which, he, saw, weber, conduct, at, this, period, wagner, entertained, ambitions, as, a, playwright, his, first, creative, effort, listed, in, the, wagner, werk, verzeichnis, the, standard, listing, of, wagner, s, works, as, wwv, 1, was, a, tragedy, called, leubald, begun, when, he, was, in, school, in, 1826, the, play, was, strongly, influenced, by, shakespeare, and, goethe, wagner, was, determined, to, set, it, to, music, and, persuaded, his, family, to, allow, him, music, lessons, by, 1827, the, family, had, returned, to, leipzig, wagner, s, first, lessons, in, harmony, were, taken, during, 1828, 1831, with, christian, gottlieb, m, ller, in,

wagner, wrote, a, piano, transcription, of, the, 9th, symphony, he, was, also, greatly, impressed, by, a, performance, of, mozart, s, requiem, wagner, s, early, piano, sonatas, and, his, first, attempts, at, orchestral, overtures, date, from, this, period, in, 1829, he, saw, a, performance, by, dramatic, soprano, wilhelmine, schr, der, devrient, who, became, his, ideal, of, the, fusion, of, drama, and, music, in, opera, in, mein, leben, wagner, wrote, when, i, look, back, across, my, entire, life, i, find, no, event, to, place, beside, this, in, the, impression, it, produced, on, me, and, claimed, that, the, profoundly, human, and, ecstatic, performance, of, this, incomparable, artist, kindled, in, him, an, almost, demonic, fire, in, 1831, wagner, enrolled, at, the, leipzig, university, where, he, became, a, member, of, the, saxon, student, fraternity, he, took, composition, lessons, with, the, thomaskantor, theodor, weinlig, weinlig, was, so, impressed, with, wagner, s, musical, ability, that, he, refused, any, payment, for, his, lessons, he, arranged, for, his, pupil, s, piano, sonata, in, b, flat, major, which, was, consequently, dedicated, to, him, to, be, published, as, wagner, s, op, 1, a, year, later, wagner, composed, his, symphony, in, c, major, a, beethovenesque, work, performed, in, prague, in, 1832, and, at, the, leipzig, gewandhaus, in, 1833, he, then, began, to, work, on, an, opera, die, hochzeit, the, wedding, which, he, never, completed, in, 1833, wagner, s, brother, albert, managed, to, obtain, for, him, a, position, as, choirmaster,

brief, appointment, as, musical, director, at, the, opera, house, in, magdeburg, during, which, he, wrote, das, liebesverbot, the, ban, on, love, based, on, shakespeare, s, measure, for, measure, this, was, staged, at, magdeburg, in, 1836, but, closed, before, the, second, performance, this, together, with, the, financial, collapse, of, the, theatre, company, employing, him, left, the,

sea, passage, to, london, from, which, wagner, drew, the, inspiration, for, his, opera, der, fliegende, holl, nder, the, flying, dutchman, with, a, plot, based, on, a, sketch, by, heinrich, heine, the, wagners, settled, in, paris, in, september, 1839, and, stayed, there, until, 1842, wagner, made, a, scant, living, by, writing, articles, and, short, novelettes, such, as, a, pilgrimage, to, beethoven, which, sketched, his, growing, concept, of, music, drama, and, an, end, in, paris, where, he, depicts, his, own, miseries, as, a, german, musician, in, the, french, metropolis, he, also, provided, arrangements, of, operas, by, other, composers, largely, on, behalf, of, the, schlesinger, publishing, house, during, this, stay, he, completed, his, third, and, fourth, operas, rienzi, and, der, fliegende, holl, nder, wagner, had, completed, rienzi, in, 1840, with, the, strong, support, of, giacomo, meyerbeer, it, was, accepted, for, performance, by, the, dresden, court, theatre,

that, en, route, from, paris, for, the, first, time, i, saw, the, rhine, with, hot, tears, in, my, eyes, i, poor, artist, swore, eternal, fidelity, to, my, german, fatherland, rienzi, was, staged, to,

there, der, fliegende, holl, nder, 2, january, 1843, and, tannh, user, 19, october, 1845, the, first, two, of, his, three, middle, period, operas, wagner, also, mixed, with, artistic, circles, in, dresden, including, the, composer, ferdinand, hiller, and, the, architect, gottfried, semper, wagner, s, involvement, in, left, wing, politics, abruptly, ended, his, welcome, in, dresden, wagner, was, active, among, socialist, german, nationalists, there, regularly, receiving, such, guests, as, the, conductor, and, radical, editor, august, r, ckel, and, the, russian, anarchist, mikhail, bakunin, he, was, also, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, pierre, joseph, proudhon, and, ludwig, feuerbach, widespread, discontent, came, to, a, head, in, 1849, when, the, unsuccessful, may, uprising, in, dresden, broke, out, in, which, wagner, played, a, minor, supporting, role, warrants, were, issued, for, the, revolutionaries, arrest, wagner, had, to, flee, first, visiting, paris, and, then, settling, in, z, rich, where, he, at, first, took, refuge, with, a, friend, alexander, m, ller, wagner, was, to, spend, the, next, twelve, years, in, exile, from, germany, he, had, completed, lohengrin, the, last, of, his, middle, period, operas, before, the, dresden, uprising, and, now, wrote, desperately, to, his, friend, franz, liszt, to, have, it, staged, in, his, absence, liszt, conducted, the, premiere, in, weimar, in, august, 1850, nevertheless, wagner, was, in, grim, personal, straits, isolated, from, the, german, musical, world, and, without, any, regular, income, in, 1850, julie, the, wife, of, his, friend, karl, ritter, began, to, pay, him, a, small, pension, which, she, maintained, until, 1859, with, help, from, her, friend, jessie, laussot, this, was, to, have, been, augmented, to, an, annual, sum, of, 3, 000, thalers, per, year, but, the, plan, was, abandoned, when, wagner, began, an, affair, with, mme, laussot, wagner, even, plotted, an, elopement, with, her, in, 1850, which, her, husband, prevented, meanwhile, wagner, s, wife, minna, who, had, disliked, the, operas, he, had, written, after, rienzi, was, falling, into, a, deepening, depression, wagner, fell, victim, to, ill, health, according, to, ernest, newman, largely, a, matter, of, overwrought, nerves, which, made, it, difficult, for, him, to, continue, writing, wagner, s, primary, published, output, during, his, first, years, in, z, rich, was, a, set, of, essays, in, the, artwork, of, the, future, 1849, he, described, a, vision, of, opera, as, gesamtkunstwerk, total, work, of, art, in, which, music, song, dance, poetry, visual, arts, and, stagecraft, were, unified, judaism, in, music, 1850, was, the, first, of, wagner, s, writings, to, feature, antisemitic, views, in, this, polemic, wagner, argued, frequently, using, traditional, antisemitic, abuse, that, jews, had, no, connection, to, the, german, spirit, and, were, thus, capable, of, producing, only, shallow, and, artificial, music, according, to, him, they, composed, music, to, achieve, popularity, and, thereby, financial, success, as, opposed, to, creating, genuine, works, of, art, in, opera, and, drama, 1851, wagner, described, the, aesthetics, of, music, drama, that, he, was, using, to, create, the, ring, cycle, before, leaving, dresden, wagner, had, drafted, a, scenario, that, eventually, became, der, ring, des, nibelungen, he, initially, wrote, the, libretto, for, a, single, opera, siegfrieds, tod, siegfried, s, death, in, 1848, after, arriving, in, z, rich, he, expanded, the, story, with, der, junge, siegfried, young, siegfried, which, explored, the, hero, s, background, he, completed, the, text, of, the, cycle, by, writing, the, libretti, for, die, walk, re, the, valkyrie, and, das, rheingold, the, rhine, gold, and, revising, the, other, libretti, to, conform, to, his, new, concept, completing, them, in, 1852, the, concept, of, opera, expressed, in, opera, and, drama, and, in, other, essays, effectively, renounced, all, the, operas, he, had, previously, written, through, lohengrin, partly, in, an, attempt, to, explain, his, change, of, views, wagner, published, in, 1851, the, autobiographical, a, communication, to, my, friends, this, included, his, first, public, announcement, of, what, was, to, become, the, ring, cycle, i, shall, never, write, an, opera, more, as, i, have, no, wish, to, invent, an, arbitrary, title, for, my, works, i, will, call, them, dramas, i, propose, to, produce, my, myth, in, three, complete, dramas, preceded, by, a, lengthy, prelude, vorspiel, at, a, specially, appointed, festival, i, propose, some, future, time, to, produce, those, three, dramas, with, their, prelude, in, the, course, of, three, days, and, a, fore, evening, wagner, began, composing, the, music, for, das, rheingold, between, november, 1853, and, september, 1854, following, it, immediately, with, die, walk, re, written, between, june, 1854, and, march, 1856, he, began, work, on, the, third, ring, drama, which, he, now, called, simply, siegfried, probably, in, september, 1856, but, by, june, 1857, he, had, completed, only, the, first, two, acts, he, decided, to, put, the, work, aside, to, concentrate, on, a, new, idea, tristan, und, isolde, based, on, the, arthurian, love, story, tristan, and, iseult, one, source, of, inspiration, for, tristan, und, isolde, was, the, philosophy, of, arthur, schopenhauer, notably, his, the, world, as, will, and, representation, to, which, wagner, had, been, introduced, in, 1854, by, his, poet, friend, georg, herwegh, wagner, later, called, this, the, most, important, event, of, his, life, his, personal, circumstances, certainly, made, him, an, easy, convert, to, what, he, understood, to, be, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, sometimes, categorized, as, philosophical, pessimism, he, remained, an, adherent, of, schopenhauer, for, the, rest, of, his, life, one, of, schopenhauer, s, doctrines, was, that, music, held, a, supreme, role, in, the, arts, as, a, direct, expression, of, the, world, s, essence, namely, blind, impulsive, will, this, doctrine, contradicted, wagner, s, view, expressed, in, opera, and, drama, that, the, music, in, opera, had, to, be, subservient, to, the, drama, wagner, scholars, have, argued, that, schopenhauer, s, influence, caused, wagner, to, assign, a, more, commanding, role, to, music, in, his, later, operas, including, the, latter, half, of, the, ring, cycle, which, he, had, yet, to, compose, aspects, of, schopenhauerian, doctrine, found, their, way, into, wagner, s, subsequent, libretti, a, second, source, of, inspiration, was, wagner, s, infatuation, with, the, poet, writer, mathilde, wesendonck, the, wife, of, the, silk, merchant, otto, wesendonck, wagner, met, the, wesendoncks, who, were, both, great, admirers, of, his, music, in, z, rich, in, 1852, from, may, 1853, onwards, wesendonck, made, several, loans, to, wagner, to, finance, his, household, expenses, in, z, rich, and, in, 1857, placed, a, cottage, on, his, estate, at, wagner, s, disposal, which, became, known, as, the, asyl, asylum, or, place, of, rest, during, this, period, wagner, s, growing, passion, for, his, patron, s, wife, inspired, him, to, put, aside, work, on, the, ring, cycle, which, was, not, resumed, for, the, next, twelve, years, and, begin, work, on, tristan, while, planning, the, opera, wagner, composed, the, wesendonck, lieder, five, songs, for, voice, and, piano, setting, poems, by, mathilde, two, of, these, settings, are, explicitly, subtitled, by, wagner, as, studies, for, tristan, und, isolde, among, the, conducting, engagements, that, wagner, undertook, for, revenue, during, this, period, he, gave, several, concerts, in, 1855, with, the, philharmonic, society, of, london, including, one, before, queen, victoria, the, queen, enjoyed, his, tannh, user, overture, and, spoke, with, wagner, after, the, concert, writing, in, her, diary, that, wagner, was, short, very, quiet, wears, spectacles, has, a, very, finely, developed, forehead, a, hooked, nose, projecting, chin, wagner, s, uneasy, affair, with, mathilde, collapsed, in, 1858, when, minna, intercepted, a, letter, to, mathilde, from, him, after, the, resulting, confrontation, with, minna, wagner, left, z, rich, alone, bound, for, venice, where, he, rented, an, apartment, in, the, palazzo, giustinian, while, minna, returned, to, germany, wagner, s, attitude, to, minna, had, changed, the, editor, of, his, correspondence, with, her, john, burk, has, said, that, she, was, to, him, an, invalid, to, be, treated, with, kindness, and, consideration, but, except, at, a, distance, a, menace, to, his, peace, of, mind, wagner, continued, his, correspondence, with, mathilde, and, his, friendship, with, her, husband, otto, who, maintained, his, financial, support, of, the, composer, in, an, 1859, letter, to, mathilde, wagner, wrote, half, satirically, of, tristan, child, this, tristan, is, turning, into, something, terrible, this, final, act, i, fear, the, opera, will, be, banned, only, mediocre, performances, can, save, me, perfectly, good, ones, will, be, bound, to, drive, people, mad, in, november, 1859, wagner, once, again, moved, to, paris, to, oversee, production, of, a, new, revision, of, tannh, user, staged, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, princess, pauline, von, metternich, whose, husband, was, the, austrian, ambassador, in, paris, the, performances, of, the, paris, tannh, user, in, 1861, were, a, notable, fiasco, this, was, partly, a, consequence, of, the, conservative, tastes, of, the, jockey, club, which, organised, demonstrations, in, the, theatre, to, protest, at, the, presentation, of, the, ballet, feature, in, act, 1, instead, of, its, traditional, location, in, the, second, act, but, the, opportunity, was, also, exploited, by, those, who, wanted, to, use, the, occasion, as, a, veiled, political, protest, against, the, pro, austrian, policies, of, napoleon, iii, it, was, during, this, visit, that, wagner, met, the, french, poet, charles, baudelaire, who, wrote, an, appreciative, brochure, richard, wagner, et, tannh, user, paris, the, opera, was, withdrawn, after, the, third, performance, and, wagner, left, paris, soon, after, he, had, sought, a, reconciliation, with, minna, during, this, paris, visit, and, although, she, joined, him, there, the, reunion, was, not, successful, and, they, again, parted, from, each, other, when, wagner, left, the, political, ban, that, had, been, placed, on, wagner, in, the, north, german, confederation, after, he, had, fled, dresden, was, fully, lifted, in, 1862, the, composer, settled, in, biebrich, on, the, rhine, near, wiesbaden, in, hesse, here, minna, visited, him, for, the, last, time, they, parted, irrevocably, though, wagner, continued, to, give, financial, support, to, her, while, she, lived, in, dresden, until, her, death, in, 1866, in, biebrich, wagner, at, last, began, work, on, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, his, only, mature, comedy, wagner, wrote, a, first, draft, of, the, libretto, in, 1845, and, he, had, resolved, to, develop, it, during, a, visit, he, had, made, to, venice, with, the, wesendoncks, in, 1860, where, he, was, inspired, by, titian, s, painting, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, throughout, this, period, 1861, 1864, wagner, sought, to, have, tristan, und, isolde, produced, in, vienna, despite, many, rehearsals, the, opera, remained, unperformed, and, gained, a, reputation, as, being, impossible, to, sing, which, added, to, wagner, s, financial, problems, wagner, s, fortunes, took, a, dramatic, upturn, in, 1864, when, king, ludwig, ii, succeeded, to, the, throne, of, bavaria, at, the, age, of, 18, the, young, king, an, ardent, admirer, of, wagner, s, operas, had, the, composer, brought, to, munich, the, king, who, was, homosexual, expressed, in, his, correspondence, a, passionate, personal, adoration, for, the, composer, and, wagner, in, his, responses, had, no, scruples, about, feigning, reciprocal, feelings, ludwig, settled, wagner, s, considerable, debts, and, proposed, to, stage, tristan, die, meistersinger, the, ring, and, the, other, operas, wagner, planned, wagner, also, began, to, dictate, his, autobiography, mein, leben, at, the, king, s, request, wagner, noted, that, his, rescue, by, ludwig, coincided, with, news, of, the, death, of, his, earlier, mentor, but, later, supposed, enemy, giacomo, meyerbeer, and, regretted, that, this, operatic, master, who, had, done, me, so, much, harm, should, not, have, lived, to, see, this, day, after, grave, difficulties, in, rehearsal, tristan, und, isolde, premiered, at, the, national, theatre, munich, on, 10, june, 1865, the, first, wagner, opera, premiere, in, almost, 15, years, the, premiere, had, been, scheduled, for, 15, may, but, was, delayed, by, bailiffs, acting, for, wagner, s, creditors, and, also, because, the, isolde, malvina, schnorr, von, carolsfeld, was, hoarse, and, needed, time, to, recover, the, conductor, of, this, premiere, was, hans, von, b, low, whose, wife, cosima, had, given, birth, in, april, that, year, to, a, daughter, named, isolde, a, child, not, of, b, low, but, of, wagner, cosima, was, 24, years, younger, than, wagner, and, was, herself, illegitimate, the, daughter, of, the, countess, marie, d, agoult, who, had, left, her, husband, for, franz, liszt, liszt, initially, disapproved, of, his, daughter, s, involvement, with, wagner, though, nevertheless, the, two, men, were, friends, the, indiscreet, affair, scandalised, munich, and, wagner, also, fell, into, disfavour, with, many, leading, members, of, the, court, who, were, suspicious, of, his, influence, on, the, king, in, december, 1865, ludwig, was, finally, forced, to, ask, the, composer, to, leave, munich, he, apparently, also, toyed, with, the, idea, of, abdicating, to, follow, his, hero, into, exile, but, wagner, quickly, dissuaded, him, ludwig, installed, wagner, at, the, villa, tribschen, beside, switzerland, s, lake, lucerne, die, meistersinger, was, completed, at, tribschen, in, 1867, and, premiered, in, munich, on, 21, june, the, following, year, at, ludwig, s, insistence, special, previews, of, the, first, two, works, of, the, ring, das, rheingold, and, die, walk, re, were, performed, at, munich, in, 1869, and, 1870, but, wagner, retained, his, dream, first, expressed, in, a, communication, to, my, friends, to, present, the, first, complete, cycle, at, a, special, festival, with, a, new, dedicated, opera, house, minna, died, of, a, heart, attack, on, 25, january, 1866, in, dresden, wagner, did, not, attend, the, funeral, following, minna, s, death, cosima, wrote, to, hans, von, b, low, several, times, asking, him, to, grant, her, a, divorce, but, b, low, refused, to, concede, this, he, consented, only, after, she, had, two, more, children, with, wagner, another, daughter, named, eva, after, the, heroine, of, meistersinger, and, a, son, siegfried, named, after, the, hero, of, the, ring, the, divorce, was, finally, sanctioned, after, delays, in, the, legal, process, by, a, berlin, court, on, 18, july, 1870, richard, and, cosima, s, wedding, took, place, on, 25, august, 1870, on, christmas, day, of, that, year, wagner, arranged, a, surprise, performance, its, premiere, of, the, siegfried, idyll, for, cosima, s, birthday, the, marriage, to, cosima, lasted, to, the, end, of, wagner, s, life, wagner, settled, into, his, new, found, domesticity, turned, his, energies, towards, completing, the, ring, cycle, he, had, not, abandoned, polemics, he, republished, his, 1850, pamphlet, judaism, in, music, originally, issued, under, a, pseudonym, under, his, own, name, in, 1869, extending, the, introduction, and, adding, a, lengthy, final, section, the, publication, led, to, several, public, protests, at, early, performances, of, die, meistersinger, in, vienna, and, mannheim, in, 1871, wagner, decided, to, move, to, bayreuth, which, was, to, be, the, location, of, his, new, opera, house, the, town, council, donated, a, large, plot, of, land, the, green, hill, as, a, site, for, the, theatre, the, wagners, moved, to, the, town, the, following, year, and, the, foundation, stone, for, the, bayreuth, festspielhaus, festival, theatre, was, laid, wagner, initially, announced, the, first, bayreuth, festival, at, which, for, the, first, time, the, ring, cycle, was, presented, complete, for, 1873, but, since, ludwig, had, declined, to, finance, the, project, the, start, of, building, was, delayed, and, the, proposed, date, for, the, festival, was, deferred, to, raise, funds, for, the, construction, wagner, societies, were, formed, in, several, cities, and, wagner, began, touring, germany, conducting, concerts, by, the, spring, of, 1873, only, a, third, of, the, required, funds, had, been, raised, further, pleas, to, ludwig, were, initially, ignored, but, early, in, 1874, with, the, project, on, the, verge, of, collapse, the, king, relented, and, provided, a, loan, the, full, building, programme, included, the, family, home, wahnfried, into, which, wagner, with, cosima, and, the, children, moved, from, their, temporary, accommodation, on, 18, april, 1874, the, theatre, was, completed, in, 1875, and, the, festival, was, scheduled, for, the, following, year, commenting, on, the, struggle, to, finish, the, building, wagner, remarked, to, cosima, each, stone, is, red, with, my, blood, and, yours, for, the, design, of, the, festspielhaus, wagner, appropriated, some, of, the, ideas, of, his, former, colleague, gottfried, semper, which, he, had, previously, solicited, for, a, proposed, new, opera, house, in, munich, wagner, was, responsible, for, several, theatrical, innovations, at, bayreuth, these, include, darkening, the, auditorium, during, performances, and, placing, the, orchestra, in, a, pit, out, of, view, of, the, audience, the, festspielhaus, finally, opened, on, 13, august, 1876, with, das, rheingold, at, last, taking, its, place, as, the, first, evening, of, the, complete, ring, cycle, the, 1876, bayreuth, festival, therefore, saw, the, premiere, of, the, complete, cycle, performed, as, a, sequence, as, the, composer, had, intended, the, 1876, festival, consisted, of, three, full, ring, cycles, under, the, baton, of, hans, richter, at, the, end, critical, reactions, ranged, between, that, of, the, norwegian, composer, edvard, grieg, who, thought, the, work, divinely, composed, and, that, of, the, french, newspaper, le, figaro, which, called, the, music, the, dream, of, a, lunatic, the, disillusioned, included, wagner, s, then, friend, friedrich, nietzsche, who, having, published, his, eulogistic, essay, richard, wagner, in, bayreuth, before, the, festival, as, part, of, his, untimely, meditations, was, bitterly, disappointed, by, what, he, saw, as, wagner, s, pandering, to, increasingly, exclusivist, german, nationalism, his, breach, with, wagner, began, at, this, time, the, festival, firmly, established, wagner, as, an, artist, of, european, and, indeed, world, importance, attendees, included, kaiser, wilhelm, i, the, emperor, pedro, ii, of, brazil, anton, bruckner, camille, saint, sa, ns, and, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, wagner, was, far, from, satisfied, with, the, festival, cosima, recorded, that, months, later, his, attitude, towards, the, productions, was, never, again, never, again, moreover, the, festival, finished, with, a, deficit, of, about, 150, 000, marks, the, expenses, of, bayreuth, and, of, wahnfried, meant, that, wagner, still, sought, further, sources, of, income, by, conducting, or, taking, on, commissions, such, as, the, centennial, march, for, america, for, which, he, received, 5, 000, following, the, first, bayreuth, festival, wagner, began, work, on, parsifal, his, final, opera, the, composition, took, four, years, much, of, which, wagner, spent, in, italy, for, health, reasons, from, 1876, to, 1878, wagner, also, embarked, on, the, last, of, his, documented, emotional, liaisons, this, time, with, judith, gautier, whom, he, had, met, at, the, 1876, festival, wagner, was, also, much, troubled, by, problems, of, financing, parsifal, and, by, the, prospect, of, the, work, being, performed, by, other, theatres, than, bayreuth, he, was, once, again, assisted, by, the, liberality, of, king, ludwig, but, was, still, forced, by, his, personal, financial, situation, in, 1877, to, sell, the, rights, of, several, of, his, unpublished, works, including, the, siegfried, idyll, to, the, publisher, schott, wagner, wrote, several, articles, in, his, later, years, often, on, political, topics, and, often, reactionary, in, tone, repudiating, some, of, his, earlier, more, liberal, views, these, include, religion, and, art, 1880, and, heroism, and, christianity, 1881, which, were, printed, in, the, journal, bayreuther, bl, tter, published, by, his, supporter, hans, von, wolzogen, wagner, s, sudden, interest, in, christianity, at, this, period, which, infuses, parsifal, was, contemporary, with, his, increasing, alignment, with, german, nationalism, and, required, on, his, part, and, the, part, of, his, associates, the, rewriting, of, some, recent, wagnerian, history, so, as, to, represent, for, example, the, ring, as, a, work, reflecting, christian, ideals, many, of, these, later, articles, including, what, is, german, 1878, but, based, on, a, draft, written, in, the, 1860s, repeated, wagner, s, antisemitic, preoccupations, wagner, completed, parsifal, in, january, 1882, and, a, second, bayreuth, festival, was, held, for, the, new, opera, which, premiered, on, 26, may, wagner, was, by, this, time, extremely, ill, having, suffered, a, series, of, increasingly, severe, angina, attacks, during, the, sixteenth, and, final, performance, of, parsifal, on, 29, august, he, entered, the, pit, unseen, during, act, 3, took, the, baton, from, conductor, hermann, levi, and, led, the, performance, to, its, conclusion, after, the, festival, the, wagner, family, journeyed, to, venice, for, the, winter, wagner, died, of, a, heart, attack, at, the, age, of, 69, on, 13, february, 1883, at, ca, vendramin, calergi, a, 16th, century, palazzo, on, the, grand, canal, the, legend, that, the, attack, was, prompted, by, an, argument, with, cosima, over, wagner, s, supposedly, amorous, interest, in, the, singer, carrie, pringle, who, had, been, a, flower, maiden, in, parsifal, at, bayreuth, is, without, credible, evidence, after, a, funerary, gondola, bore, wagner, s, remains, over, the, grand, canal, his, body, was, taken, to, germany, where, it, was, buried, in, the, garden, of, the, villa, wahnfried, in, bayreuth, wagner, s, musical, output, is, listed, by, the, wagner, werk, verzeichnis, wwv, as, comprising, 113, works, including, fragments, and, projects, the, first, complete, scholarly, edition, of, his, musical, works, in, print, was, commenced, in, 1970, under, the, aegis, of, the, bavarian, academy, of, fine, arts, and, the, akademie, der, wissenschaften, und, der, literatur, of, mainz, and, is, presently, under, the, editorship, of, egon, voss, it, will, consist, of, 21, volumes, 57, books, of, music, and, 10, volumes, 13, books, of, relevant, documents, and, texts, as, at, october, 2017, three, volumes, remain, to, be, published, the, publisher, is, schott, music, wagner, s, operatic, works, are, his, primary, artistic, legacy, unlike, most, opera, composers, who, generally, left, the, task, of, writing, the, libretto, the, text, and, lyrics, to, others, wagner, wrote, his, own, libretti, which, he, referred, to, as, poems, from, 1849, onwards, he, urged, a, new, concept, of, opera, often, referred, to, as, music, drama, although, he, later, rejected, this, term, in, which, all, musical, poetic, and, dramatic, elements, were, to, be, fused, together, the, gesamtkunstwerk, wagner, developed, a, compositional, style, in, which, the, importance, of, the, orchestra, is, equal, to, that, of, the, singers, the, orchestra, s, dramatic, role, in, the, later, operas, includes, the, use, of, leitmotifs, musical, phrases, that, can, be, interpreted, as, announcing, specific, characters, locales, and, plot, elements, their, complex, interweaving, and, evolution, illuminate, the, progression, of, the, drama, these, operas, are, still, despite, wagner, s, reservations, referred, to, by, many, writers, as, music, dramas, wagner, s, earliest, attempts, at, opera, were, often, uncompleted, abandoned, works, include, a, pastoral, opera, based, on, goethe, s, die, laune, des, verliebten, the, infatuated, lover, s, caprice, written, at, the, age, of, 17, die, hochzeit, the, wedding, on, which, wagner, worked, in, 1832, and, the, singspiel, m, nnerlist, gr, er, als, frauenlist, men, are, more, cunning, than, women, 1837, 1838, die, feen, the, fairies, 1833, was, not, performed, in, the, composer, s, lifetime, and, das, liebesverbot, the, ban, on, love, 1836, was, withdrawn, after, its, first, performance, rienzi, 1842, was, wagner, s, first, opera, to, be, successfully, staged, the, compositional, style, of, these, early, works, was, conventional, the, relatively, more, sophisticated, rienzi, showing, the, clear, influence, of, grand, opera, la, spontini, and, meyerbeer, and, did, not, exhibit, the, innovations, that, would, mark, wagner, s, place, in, musical, history, later, in, life, wagner, said, that, he, did, not, consider, these, works, to, be, part, of, his, oeuvre, and, they, have, been, performed, only, rarely, in, the, last, hundred, years, although, the, overture, to, rienzi, is, an, occasional, concert, hall, piece, die, feen, das, liebesverbot, and, rienzi, were, performed, at, both, leipzig, and, bayreuth, in, 2013, to, mark, the, composer, s, bicentenary, wagner, s, middle, stage, output, began, with, der, fliegende, holl, nder, the, flying, dutchman, 1843, followed, by, tannh, user, 1845, and, lohengrin, 1850, these, three, operas, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, wagner, s, romantic, operas, they, reinforced, the, reputation, among, the, public, in, germany, and, beyond, that, wagner, had, begun, to, establish, with, rienzi, although, distancing, himself, from, the, style, of, these, operas, from, 1849, onwards, he, nevertheless, reworked, both, der, fliegende, holl, nder, and, tannh, user, on, several, occasions, these, three, operas, are, considered, to, represent, a, significant, developmental, stage, in, wagner, s, musical, and, operatic, maturity, as, regards, thematic, handling, portrayal, of, emotions, and, orchestration, they, are, the, earliest, works, included, in, the, bayreuth, canon, the, mature, operas, that, cosima, staged, at, the, bayreuth, festival, after, wagner, s, death, in, accordance, with, his, wishes, all, three, including, the, differing, versions, of, der, fliegende, holl, nder, and, tannh, user, continue, to, be, regularly, performed, throughout, the, world, and, have, been, frequently, recorded, they, were, also, the, operas, by, which, his, fame, spread, during, his, lifetime, wagner, s, late, dramas, are, considered, his, masterpieces, der, ring, des, nibelungen, commonly, referred, to, as, the, ring, or, ring, cycle, is, a, set, of, four, operas, based, loosely, on, figures, and, elements, of, germanic, mythology, particularly, from, the, later, norse, mythology, notably, the, old, norse, poetic, edda, and, volsunga, saga, and, the, middle, high, german, nibelungenlied, wagner, specifically, developed, the, libretti, for, these, operas, according, to, his, interpretation, of, stabreim, highly, alliterative, rhyming, verse, pairs, used, in, old, germanic, poetry, they, were, also, influenced, by, wagner, s, concepts, of, ancient, greek, drama, in, which, tetralogies, were, a, component, of, athenian, festivals, and, which, he, had, amply, discussed, in, his, essay, oper, und, drama, the, first, two, components, of, the, ring, cycle, were, das, rheingold, the, rhinegold, which, was, completed, in, 1854, and, die, walk, re, the, valkyrie, which, was, finished, in, 1856, in, das, rheingold, with, its, relentlessly, talky, realism, the, absence, of, lyrical, numbers, wagner, came, very, close, to, the, musical, ideals, of, his, 1849, 1851, essays, die, walk, re, which, contains, what, is, virtually, a, traditional, aria, siegmund, s, winterst, rme, in, the, first, act, and, the, quasi, choral, appearance, of, the, valkyries, themselves, shows, more, operatic, traits, but, has, been, assessed, by, barry, millington, as, the, music, drama, that, most, satisfactorily, embodies, the, theoretical, principles, of, oper, und, drama, a, thoroughgoing, synthesis, of, poetry, and, music, is, achieved, without, any, notable, sacrifice, in, musical, expression, while, composing, the, opera, siegfried, the, third, part, of, the, ring, cycle, wagner, interrupted, work, on, it, and, between, 1857, and, 1864, wrote, the, tragic, love, story, tristan, und, isolde, and, his, only, mature, comedy, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, the, mastersingers, of, nuremberg, two, works, that, are, also, part, of, the, regular, operatic, canon, tristan, is, often, granted, a, special, place, in, musical, history, many, see, it, as, the, beginning, of, the, move, away, from, conventional, harmony, and, tonality, and, consider, that, it, lays, the, groundwork, for, the, direction, of, classical, music, in, the, 20th, century, wagner, felt, that, his, musico, dramatical, theories, were, most, perfectly, realised, in, this, work, with, its, use, of, the, art, of, transition, between, dramatic, elements, and, the, balance, achieved, between, vocal, and, orchestral, lines, completed, in, 1859, the, work, was, given, its, first, performance, in, munich, conducted, by, b, low, in, june, 1865, die, meistersinger, was, originally, conceived, by, wagner, in, 1845, as, a, sort, of, comic, pendant, to, tannh, user, like, tristan, it, was, premiered, in, munich, under, the, baton, of, b, low, on, 21, june, 1868, and, became, an, immediate, success, millington, describes, meistersinger, as, a, rich, perceptive, music, drama, widely, admired, for, its, warm, humanity, but, its, strong, german, nationalist, overtones, have, led, some, to, cite, it, as, an, example, of, wagner, s, reactionary, politics, and, antisemitism, when, wagner, returned, to, writing, the, music, for, the, last, act, of, siegfried, and, for, g, tterd, mmerung, twilight, of, the, gods, as, the, final, part, of, the, ring, his, style, had, changed, once, more, to, something, more, recognisable, as, operatic, than, the, aural, world, of, rheingold, and, walk, re, though, it, was, still, thoroughly, stamped, with, his, own, originality, as, a, composer, and, suffused, with, leitmotifs, this, was, in, part, because, the, libretti, of, the, four, ring, operas, had, been, written, in, reverse, order, so, that, the, book, for, g, tterd, mmerung, was, conceived, more, traditionally, than, that, of, rheingold, still, the, self, imposed, strictures, of, the, gesamtkunstwerk, had, become, relaxed, the, differences, also, result, from, wagner, s, development, as, a, composer, during, the, period, in, which, he, wrote, tristan, meistersinger, and, the, paris, version, of, tannh, user, from, act, 3, of, siegfried, onwards, the, ring, becomes, more, chromatic, melodically, more, complex, harmonically, and, more, developmental, in, its, treatment, of, leitmotifs, wagner, took, 26, years, from, writing, the, first, draft, of, a, libretto, in, 1848, until, he, completed, g, tterd, mmerung, in, 1874, the, ring, takes, about, 15, hours, to, perform, and, is, the, only, undertaking, of, such, size, to, be, regularly, presented, on, the, world, s, stages, wagner, s, final, opera, parsifal, 1882, which, was, his, only, work, written, especially, for, his, bayreuth, festspielhaus, and, which, is, described, in, the, score, as, a, b, hnenweihfestspiel, festival, play, for, the, consecration, of, the, stage, has, a, storyline, suggested, by, elements, of, the, legend, of, the, holy, grail, it, also, carries, elements, of, buddhist, renunciation, suggested, by, wagner, s, readings, of, schopenhauer, wagner, described, it, to, cosima, as, his, last, card, it, remains, controversial, because, of, its, treatment, of, christianity, its, eroticism, and, its, expression, as, perceived, by, some, commentators, of, german, nationalism, and, antisemitism, despite, the, composer, s, own, description, of, the, opera, to, king, ludwig, as, this, most, christian, of, works, ulrike, kienzle, has, commented, that, wagner, s, turn, to, christian, mythology, upon, which, the, imagery, and, spiritual, contents, of, parsifal, rest, is, idiosyncratic, and, contradicts, christian, dogma, in, many, ways, musically, the, opera, has, been, held, to, represent, a, continuing, development, of, the, composer, s, style, and, millington, describes, it, as, a, diaphanous, score, of, unearthly, beauty, and, refinement, apart, from, his, operas, wagner, composed, relatively, few, pieces, of, music, these, include, his, symphony, in, c, major, written, at, the, age, of, 19, the, faust, overture, the, only, completed, part, of, an, intended, symphony, on, the, subject, some, concert, overtures, and, choral, and, piano, pieces, his, most, commonly, performed, work, that, is, not, an, extract, from, an, opera, is, the, siegfried, idyll, for, chamber, orchestra, which, has, several, motifs, in, common, with, the, ring, cycle, the, wesendonck, lieder, are, also, often, performed, either, in, the, original, piano, version, or, with, orchestral, accompaniment, more, rarely, performed, are, the, american, centennial, march, 1876, and, das, liebesmahl, der, apostel, the, love, feast, of, the, apostles, a, piece, for, male, choruses, and, orchestra, composed, in, 1843, for, the, city, of, dresden, after, completing, parsifal, wagner, expressed, his, intention, to, turn, to, the, writing, of, symphonies, and, several, sketches, dating, from, the, late, 1870s, and, early, 1880s, have, been, identified, as, work, towards, this, end, the, overtures, and, certain, orchestral, passages, from, wagner, s, middle, and, late, stage, operas, are, commonly, played, as, concert, pieces, for, most, of, these, wagner, wrote, or, rewrote, short, passages, to, ensure, musical, coherence, the, bridal, chorus, from, lohengrin, is, frequently, played, as, the, bride, s, processional, wedding, march, in, english, speaking, countries, wagner, was, an, extremely, prolific, writer, authoring, many, books, poems, and, articles, as, well, as, voluminous, correspondence, his, writings, covered, a, wide, range, of, topics, including, autobiography, politics, philosophy, and, detailed, analyses, of, his, own, operas, wagner, planned, for, a, collected, edition, of, his, publications, as, early, as, 1865, he, believed, that, such, an, edition, would, help, the, world, understand, his, intellectual, development, and, artistic, aims, the, first, such, edition, was, published, between, 1871, and, 1883, but, was, doctored, to, suppress, or, alter, articles, that, were, an, embarrassment, to, him, e, g, those, praising, meyerbeer, or, by, altering, dates, on, some, articles, to, reinforce, wagner, s, own, account, of, his, progress, wagner, s, autobiography, mein, leben, was, originally, published, for, close, friends, only, in, a, very, small, edition, 15, 18, copies, per, volume, in, four, volumes, between, 1870, and, 1880, the, first, public, edition, with, many, passages, suppressed, by, cosima, appeared, in, 1911, the, first, attempt, at, a, full, edition, in, german, appeared, in, 1963, there, have, been, modern, complete, or, partial, editions, of, wagner, s, writings, including, a, centennial, edition, in, german, edited, by, dieter, borchmeyer, which, however, omitted, the, essay, das, judenthum, in, der, musik, and, mein, leben, the, english, translations, of, wagner, s, prose, in, eight, volumes, by, william, ashton, ellis, 1892, 1899, are, still, in, print, and, commonly, used, despite, their, deficiencies, the, first, complete, historical, and, critical, edition, of, wagner, s, prose, works, was, launched, in, 2013, at, the, institute, for, music, research, at, the, university, of, w, rzburg, this, will, result, in, at, least, eight, volumes, of, text, and, several, volumes, of, commentary, totalling, over, 5, 000, pages, it, was, originally, anticipated, that, the, project, will, be, completed, by, 2030, a, complete, edition, of, wagner, s, correspondence, estimated, to, amount, to, between, 10, 000, and, 12, 000, items, is, underway, under, the, supervision, of, the, university, of, w, rzburg, as, of, january, 2021, 25, volumes, have, appeared, covering, the, period, to, 1873, wagner, s, later, musical, style, introduced, new, ideas, in, harmony, melodic, process, leitmotif, and, operatic, structure, notably, from, tristan, und, isolde, onwards, he, explored, the, limits, of, the, traditional, tonal, system, which, gave, keys, and, chords, their, identity, pointing, the, way, to, atonality, in, the, 20th, century, some, music, historians, date, the, beginning, of, modern, classical, music, to, the, first, notes, of, tristan, which, include, the, so, called, tristan, chord, wagner, inspired, great, devotion, for, a, long, period, many, composers, were, inclined, to, align, themselves, with, or, against, wagner, s, music, anton, bruckner, and, hugo, wolf, were, greatly, indebted, to, him, as, were, c, sar, franck, henri, duparc, ernest, chausson, jules, massenet, richard, strauss, alexander, von, zemlinsky, hans,

germany, during, the, 20th, century, has, continued, wagner, s, hostile, writings, on, jews, including, jewishness, in, music, correspond, to, some, existing, trends, of, thought, in, germany, during, the, 19th, century, despite, his, very, public, views, on, this, topic, throughout, his, life, wagner, had, jewish, friends, colleagues, and, supporters, there, have, been, frequent, suggestions, that, antisemitic, stereotypes, are, represented, in, wagner, s, operas, the, characters, of, alberich, and, mime, in, the, ring, sixtus, beckmesser, in, die, meistersinger, and, klingsor, in, parsifal, are, sometimes, claimed, as, jewish, representations, though, they, are, not, identified, as, such, in, the, librettos, of, these, operas, the, topic, is, further, complicated, by, claims, which, may, have, been, credited, by, wagner, that, he, himself, was, of, jewish, ancestry, via, his, supposed, father, geyer, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, geyer, had, jewish, ancestors, some, biographers, have, noted, that, wagner, in, his, final, years, developed, an, interest, in, the, racialist, philosophy, of, arthur, de, gobineau, notably, gobineau, s, belief, that, western, society, was, doomed, because, of, miscegenation, between, superior, and, inferior, races, according, to, robert, gutman, this, theme, is, reflected, in, the, opera, parsifal, other, biographers, such, as, lucy, beckett, believe, that, this, is, not, true, as, the, original, drafts, of, the, story, date, back, to, 1857, and, wagner, had, completed, the, libretto, for, parsifal, by, 1877, but, he, displayed, no, significant, public, interest, in, gobineau, until, 1880, wagner, s, ideas, are, amenable, to, socialist, interpretations, many, of, his, ideas, on, art, were, being, formulated, at, the, time, of, his, revolutionary, inclinations, in, the, 1840s, thus, for, example, george, bernard, shaw, wrote, in, the, perfect, wagnerite, 1883, picture, of, niblunghome, under, the, reign, of, alberic, is, a, poetic, vision, of, unregulated, industrial, capitalism, as, it, was, made, known, in, germany, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, by, engels, s, book, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, left, wing, interpretations, of, wagner, also, inform, the, writings, of, theodor, adorno, among, other, wagner, critics, walter, benjamin, gave, wagner, as, an, example, of, bourgeois, false, consciousness, alienating, art, from, its, social, context, gy, rgy, luk, cs, contended, that, the, ideas, of, the, early, wagner, represented, the, ideology, of, the, true, socialists, wahre, sozialisten, a, movement, referenced, in, karl, marx, s, communist, manifesto, as, belonging, to, the, left, wing, of, german, bourgeois, radicalism, and, associated, with, feuerbachianism, and, karl, theodor, ferdinand, gr, n, while, anatoly, lunacharsky, said, about, the, later, wagner, the, circle, is, complete, the, revolutionary, has, become, a, reactionary, the, rebellious, petty, bourgeois, now, kisses, the, slipper, of, the, pope, the, keeper, of, order, the, writer, robert, donington, has, produced, a, detailed, if, controversial, jungian, interpretation, of, the, ring, cycle, described, as, an, approach, to, wagner, by, way, of, his, symbols, which, for, example, sees, the, character, of, the, goddess, fricka, as, part, of, her, husband, wotan, s, inner, femininity, millington, notes, that, jean, jacques, nattiez, has, also, applied, psychoanalytical, techniques, in, an, evaluation, of, wagner, s, life, and, works, adolf, hitler, was, an, admirer, of, wagner, s, music, and, saw, in, his, operas, an, embodiment, of, his, own, vision, of, the, german, nation, in, a, 1922, speech, he, claimed, that, wagner, s, works, glorified, the, heroic, teutonic, nature, greatness, lies, in, the, heroic, hitler, visited, bayreuth, frequently, from, 1923, onwards, and, attended, the, productions, at, the, theatre, there, continues, to, be, debate, about, the, extent, to, which, wagner, s, views, might, have, influenced, nazi, thinking, houston, stewart, chamberlain, 1855, 1927, who, married, wagner, s, daughter, eva, in, 1908, but, never, met, wagner, was, the, author, of, the, foundations, of, the, nineteenth, century, approved, by, the, nazi, movement, chamberlain, met, hitler, several, times, between, 1923, and, 1927, in, bayreuth, but, cannot, credibly, be, regarded, as, a, conduit, of, wagner, s, own, views, the, nazis, used, those, parts, of, wagner, s, thought, that, were, useful, for, propaganda, and, ignored, or, suppressed, the, rest, while, bayreuth, presented, a, useful, front, for, nazi, culture, and, wagner, s, music, was, used, at, many, nazi, events, the, nazi, hierarchy, as, a, whole, did, not, share, hitler, s, enthusiasm, for, wagner, s, operas, and, resented, attending, these, lengthy, epics, at, hitler, s, insistence, some, nazi, ideologists, most, notably, alfred, rosenberg, rejected, parsifal, as, excessively, christian, and, pacifist, guido, fackler, has, researched, evidence, that, indicates, that, it, is, possible, that, wagner, s, music, was, used, at, the, dachau, concentration, camp, in, 1933, 1934, to, reeducate, political, prisoners, by, exposure, to, national, music, there, has, been, no, evidence, to, support, claims, sometimes, made, that, his, music, was, played, at, nazi, death, camps, during, the, second, world, war, and, pamela, potter, has, noted, that, wagner, s, music, was, explicitly, off, limits, in, the, camps, because, of, the, associations, of, wagner, with, antisemitism, and, nazism, the, performance, of, his, music, in, the, state, of, israel, has, been, a, source, of, controversy, operas, writings, scores, other,
