camelot, the, song, of, roland, and, other, tales, of, romantic, chivalry, he, joined, the, army, at, seventeen, and, according, to, one, biographer, he, strutted, about, with, his, cape, flying, open, to, reveal, his, tight, fitting, hose, and, boots, a, sword, and, dagger, at, his, waist, according, to, another, he, was, a, fancy, dresser, an, expert, dancer, a, womanizer, sensitive, to,

useful, to, the, duke, under, the, duke, s, leadership, igo, participated, in, many, battles, without, injury, however, at, the, battle, of, pamplona, on, 20, may, 1521, he, was, gravely, injured, when, a, french, navarrese, expedition, force, stormed, the, fortress, of, pamplona, and, a, cannonball, ricocheting, off, a, nearby, wall, fractured, his, right, leg, igo, was, returned, to, his, father, s, castle, in, loyola, where, in, an, era, before, anesthetics, he, underwent, several, surgical, operations, to, repair, the, leg, with, his, bones, set, and, rebroken, in, the, end, the, operations, left, his, right, leg, shorter, than, the, other, he, would, limp, for, the, rest, of, his, life, with, his, military, career, over, while, recovering, from, surgery, igo, underwent, a, spiritual, conversion, and, discerned, a, call, to, the, religious, life, in, order, to, divert, the, weary, hours, of, convalescence, he, asked, for, the, romances, of, chivalry, his, favourite, reading, but, there, were, none, in, the, castle, and, instead, his, beloved, sister, in, law, magdalena, de, araoz, brought, him, the, lives, of, christ, and, of, the, saints, the, religious, work, which, most, particularly, struck, him, was, the, de, vita, christi, of, ludolph, of, saxony, this, book, would, influence, his, whole, life, inspiring, him, to, devote, himself, to, god, and, follow, the, example, of, francis, of, assisi, and, other, great, monks, it, also, inspired, his, method, of, meditation, since, ludolph, proposes, that, the, reader, place, himself, mentally, at, the, scene, of, the, gospel, story, visualising, the, crib, at, the, nativity, etc, this, type, of, meditation, known, as, simple, contemplation, was, the, basis, for, the, method, that, ignatius, outlined, in, his, spiritual, exercises, aside, from, dreaming, about, imitating, the, saints, in, his, readings, igo, was, still, wandering, off, in, his, mind, about, what, he, would, do, in, service, to, his, king, and, in, honour, of, the, royal, lady, he, was, in, love, with, cautiously, he, came, to, realize, the, after, effects, of, both, kinds, of, his, dreams, he, experienced, desolation, and, dissatisfaction, when, the, romantic, heroism, dream, was, over, but, the, saintly, dream, ended, with, much, joy, and, peace, it, was, the, first, time, he, learned, about, discernment, after, he, had, recovered, sufficiently, to, walk, again, igo, resolved, to, begin, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, to, kiss, the, earth, where, our, lord, had, walked, and, to, do, stricter, penances, he, thought, that, his, plan, was, confirmed, by, a, vision, of, the, virgin, mary, and, the, infant, jesus, he, experienced, one, night, which, resulted, in, much, consolation, to, him, in, march, 1522, he, visited, the, benedictine, monastery, of, santa, maria, de, montserrat, there, he, carefully, examined, his, past, sins, confessed, gave, his, fine, clothes, to, the, poor, he, met, wore, a, garment, of, sack, cloth, then, hung, his, sword, and, dagger, at, the, virgin, s, altar, during, an, overnight, vigil, at, the, shrine, from, montserrat, he, walked, on, to, the, nearby, town, of, manresa, catalonia, where, he, lived, for, about, a, year, begging, for, his, keep, and, then, eventually, doing, chores, at, a, local, hospital, in, exchange, for, food, and, lodging, for, several, months, he, spent, much, of, his, time, praying, in, a, cave, nearby, where, he, practised, rigorous, asceticism, praying, for, seven, hours, a, day, and, formulating, the, fundamentals, of, his, spiritual, exercises, igo, also, experienced, a, series, of, visions, in, full, daylight, while, at, the, hospital, these, repeated, visions, appeared, as, a, form, in, the, air, near, him, and, this, form, gave, him, much, consolation, because, it, was, exceedingly, beautiful, it, somehow, seemed, to, have, the, shape, of, a, serpent, and, had, many, things, that, shone, like, eyes, but, were, not, eyes, he, received, much, delight, and, consolation, from, gazing, upon, this, object, but, when, the, object, vanished, he, became, disconsolate, he, came, to, interpret, this, vision, as, diabolical, in, nature, in, september, 1523, igo, made, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, with, the, aim, of, settling, there, he, remained, there, from, 3, to, 23, september, but, was, sent, back, to, europe, by, the, franciscans, he, returned, to, barcelona, and, at, the, age, of, 33, attended, a, free, public, grammar, school, in, preparation, for, university, entrance, he, went, on, to, the, university, of, alcal, where, he, studied, theology, and, latin, from, 1526, to, 1527, there, he, encountered, a, number, of, devout, women, who, had, been, called, before, the, inquisition, these, women, were, considered, alumbrados, a, group, linked, in, their, zeal, and, spirituality, to, franciscan, reforms, but, they, had, incurred, mounting, suspicion, from, the, administrators, of, the, inquisition, once, when, igo, was, preaching, on, the, street, three, of, these, devout, women, began, to, experience, ecstatic, states, one, fell, senseless, another, sometimes, rolled, about, on, the, ground, another, had, been, seen, in, the, grip, of, convulsions, or, shuddering, and, sweating, in, anguish, the, suspicious, activity, took, place, while, igo, had, preached, without, a, degree, in, theology, as, a, result, he, was, singled, out, for, interrogation, by, the, inquisition, but, was, later, released, following, these, risky, activities, igo, by, this, time, he, had, changed, his, name, to, ignatius, probably, to, make, it, more, acceptable, to, other, europeans, adopted, the, surname, de, loyola, in, reference, to, the, basque, village, of, loyola, where, he, was, born, moved, to, france, to, study, at, the, university, of, paris, he, attended, first, the, ascetic, coll, ge, de, montaigu, moving, on, to, the, coll, ge, sainte, barbe, to, study, for, a, master, s, degree, he, arrived, in, france, at, a, time, of, anti, protestant, turmoil, which, had, forced, john, calvin, to, flee, france, very, soon, after, ignatius, had, gathered, around, him, six, companions, all, of, them, fellow, students, at, the, university, they, were, the, spaniards, alfonso, salmeron, diego, laynez, and, nicholas, bobadilla, with, the, portuguese, sim, o, rodrigues, the, basque, francis, xavier, and, peter, faber, a, savoyard, the, latter, two, becoming, his, first, companions, and, his, closest, associates, in, the, foundation, of, the, future, jesuit, order, on, the, morning, of, the, 15th, of, august, 1534, in, the, chapel, of, church, of, saint, peter, at, montmartre, loyola, and, his, six, companions, of, whom, only, one, was, a, priest, met, and, took, upon, themselves, the, solemn, vows, of, their, lifelong, work, ignatius, gained, a, magisterium, from, the, university, of, paris, at, the, age, of, forty, three, in, 1535, in, later, life, he, would, often, be, called, master, ignatius, because, of, this, in, 1539, with, peter, faber, and, francis, xavier, ignatius, formed, the, society, of, jesus, which, was, approved, in, 1540, by, pope, paul, iii, he, was, chosen, as, the, first, superior, general, of, the, order, and, invested, with, the, title, of, father, general, by, the, jesuits, ignatius, sent, his, companions, on, missions, across, europe, to, create, schools, colleges, and, seminaries, juan, de, vega, then, ambassador, of, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, in, rome, met, ignatius, there, and, having, formed, a, good, impression, of, the, jesuits, invited, them, to, travel, with, him, to, his, new, appointment, as, viceroy, of, sicily, as, a, result, a, jesuit, college, was, opened, in, messina, which, proved, a, success, so, that, its, rules, and, methods, were, later, copied, in, subsequent, colleges, in, a, letter, to, francis, xavier, before, his, departure, to, india, in, 1541, ignatius, famously, used, the, latin, phrase, ite, inflammate, omnia, meaning, go, set, the, world, on, fire, a, phrase, used, in, the, jesuit, order, to, this, day, with, the, assistance, of, his, secretary, juan, alfonso, de, polanco, ignatius, wrote, the, jesuit, constitutions, which, were, adopted, in, 1553, they, created, a, centralised, organisation, of, the, order, and, stressed, absolute, self, denial, and, obedience, to, the, pope, and, to, superiors, in, the, church, hierarchy, this, was, summarised, in, the, motto, perinde, ac, cadaver, as, if, a, dead, body, meaning, that, a, jesuit, should, be, as, empty, of, ego, as, is, a, corpse, however, the, overarching, jesuit, principle, became, ad, maiorem, dei, gloriam, for, the, greater, glory, of, god, ignatius, died, in, rome, on, 31, july, 1556,
