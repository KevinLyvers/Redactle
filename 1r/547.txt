and, african, american, background, he, was, raised, in, kansas, city, missouri, near, westport, road, his, father, was, often, required, to, travel, for, work, but, provided, some, musical,

kansas, city, and, often, ambitiously, took, part, in, jam, sessions, with, more, experienced, musicians, in, early, 1936, at, one, such, jam, session, with, the, count, basie, orchestra, he, lost, track, of, the, chord, changes, while, improvising, this, prompted, jo, jones, to, contemptuously, remove, a, cymbal, from, his, drum, kit, and, throw, it, at, his, feet, as, a, signal, to, leave, the, stage, rather, than, becoming, discouraged, parker, vowed, to, practice, harder, he, mastered, improvisation, and, according, to, his, comments, in, an, interview, with, paul, desmond, spent, the, next, three, to, four, years, practicing, up, to, 15, hours, a, day, parker, proposed, to, rebecca, ruffin, his, girlfriend, four, years, his, senior, and, the, two, were, married, on, july, 25, 1936, they, had, two, children, together, before, divorcing, in, 1939, in, large, part, due, to, his, growing, drug, addiction, in, late, 1936, parker, and, a, kansas, city, band, traveled, to, the, ozarks, for, the, opening, of, musser, s, resort, south, of, eldon, missouri, along, the, way, the, caravan, of, musicians, had, a, car, accident, and, parker, broke, three, ribs, and, fractured, his, spine, despite, his, near, death, experience, on, the, way, to, the, ozarks, in, 1936, parker, returned, to, the, area, in, the, summer, of, 1937, where, he, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, woodshedding, and, developing, his, sound, working, with, two, musicians, on, chordal, instruments, a, pianist, and, guitarist, respectively, he, was, able, to, practice, improvising, over, chord, changes, and, began, to, develop, the, ability, to, solo, fluently, across, chords, and, scales, in, 1938, parker, joined, pianist, jay, mcshann, s, territory, band, his, first, gig, with, the, band, was, during, the, summer, or, early, fall, at, the, continental, club, in, kansas, city, where, parker, worked, as, a, substitute, alto, saxophonist, for, edward, popeye, hale, in, december, he, joined, harlan, leonard, s, rockets, the, band, played, at, dances, including, a, christmas, dance, for, which, parker, was, listed, in, a, local, newspaper, as, one, of, the, rockets, personnel, in, 1939, parker, moved, to, new, york, city, to, pursue, his, musical, career, but, worked, part, time, jobs, to, make, a, living, among, the, more, musically, significant, of, these, jobs, was, as, a, dishwasher, for, nine, dollars, a, week, at, jimmie, s, chicken, shack, where, pianist, art, tatum, performed, struggling, with, poverty, parker, went, to, the, home, of, fellow, alto, saxophone, player, buster, smith, to, ask, for, help, smith, allowed, parker, to, live, in, his, apartment, for, six, months, and, gave, him, gigs, in, his, band, parker, s, playing, at, these, gigs, impressed, several, new, york, musicians, including, pianist, and, bandleader, earl, hines, while, living, in, new, york, parker, achieved, his, musical, breakthrough, developing, a, new, improvisational, vocabulary, which, later, came, to, be, known, as, bebop, playing, cherokee, in, a, practice, session, with, guitarist, william, biddy, fleet, he, realized, that, the, 12, semitones, of, the, chromatic, scale, can, lead, melodically, to, any, key, breaking, some, of, the, confines, of, simpler, jazz, soloing, parker, recalled, i, d, been, getting, bored, with, the, stereotyped, changes, that, were, being, used, all, the, time, at, the, time, and, i, kept, thinking, there, s, bound, to, be, something, else, i, could, hear, it, sometimes, but, i, couldn, t, play, it, well, that, night, i, was, working, over, cherokee, and, as, i, did, i, found, that, by, using, the, higher, intervals, of, a, chord, as, a, melody, line, and, backing, them, with, appropriately, related, changes, i, could, play, the, thing, i, d, been, hearing, i, came, alive, in, 1940, he, returned, to, kansas, city, to, perform, with, jay, mcshann, and, to, attend, the, funeral, of, his, father, charles, sr, the, younger, parker, then, spent, the, summer, in, mcshann, s, band, playing, at, fairyland, park, for, all, white, audiences, trumpet, player, bernard, anderson, introduced, him, to, dizzy, gillespie, the, band, also, toured, nightclubs, and, other, venues, of, the, southwest, as, well, as, chicago, and, new, york, city, and, parker, made, his, professional, recording, debut, with, mcshann, s, band, that, year, when, in, new, york, to, experiment, with, his, new, musical, ideas, that, went, beyond, the, bounds, of, mcshann, s, group, parker, joined, a, group, of, young, musicians, who, played, in, after, hours, clubs, in, harlem, venues, including, clark, monroe, s, uptown, house, fellow, musicians, at, the, venues, included, developing, beboppers, gillespie, pianist, thelonious, monk, guitarist, charlie, christian, and, drummer, kenny, clarke, a, pianist, and, one, of, the, pioneers, of, bebop, mary, lou, williams, offered, a, further, explanation, that, the, after, hours, sessions, were, an, opportunity, to, challenge, the, practice, of, downtown, musicians, coming, uptown, and, stealing, the, music, parker, left, mcshann, s, band, in, 1942, and, played, for, one, year, with, hines, whose, band, also, included, gillespie, however, this, band, s, performances, and, therefore, parker, s, role, in, them, are, virtually, undocumented, due, to, the, strike, of, 1942, 1944, by, the, american, federation, of, musicians, during, which, time, few, professional, recordings, were, made, in, fact, much, of, bebop, s, critical, early, development, was, not, captured, for, posterity, due, to, the, ban, and, the, new, genre, gained, limited, radio, exposure, as, a, result, the, few, recordings, in, which, parker, participated, in, 1943, took, place, in, chicago, and, included, a, jam, session, recording, with, gillespie, and, bassist, oscar, pettiford, another, session, with, billy, eckstine, playing, trumpet, some, informally, recorded, practice, sessions, and, a, duo, with, pianist, hazel, scott, parker, s, time, with, hines, band, and, his, traveling, between, new, york, and, chicago, enabled, him, to, model, his, style, on, according, to, his, own, words, a, combination, of, the, midwestern, beat, and, the, fast, new, york, tempos, parker, began, writing, compositions, thanks, to, his, growing, friendship, with, gillespie, who, began, notating, parker, s, solos, as, melodies, among, these, early, parker, compositions, were, koko, anthropology, and, confirmation, parker, left, hines, band, and, formed, a, small, group, with, gillespie, pianist, al, haig, bassist, curley, russell, and, drummer, stan, levey, the, group, stood, out, from, its, contemporaries, as, it, was, racially, integrated, and, it, lacked, a, guitarist, for, rhythmic, support, this, new, format, enabled, soloists, to, be, freed, from, harmonic, and, rhythmic, restrictions, and, in, late, 1944, the, group, secured, a, gig, at, the, three, deuces, club, in, new, york, the, group, s, name, recognition, spread, along, 52nd, street, and, its, style, was, dubbed, bebop, for, the, first, time, musicians, at, other, clubs, came, to, hear, bebop, and, reacted, negatively, to, it, because, according, to, bassist, charles, mingus, they, saw, it, as, a, threat, to, their, existing, style, of, jazz, it, was, not, until, 1945, after, the, afm, s, recording, ban, was, lifted, that, parker, s, collaborations, with, dizzy, gillespie, max, roach, and, others, had, a, substantial, effect, on, the, jazz, world, one, of, their, first, small, group, performances, together, was, rediscovered, in, 2004, and, released, in, 2005, a, concert, in, new, york, s, town, hall, on, june, 22, 1945, bebop, soon, gained, wider, appeal, among, musicians, and, fans, on, november, 26, 1945, parker, led, a, record, date, for, savoy, records, marketed, as, the, greatest, jazz, session, ever, recording, as, charlie, parker, s, reboppers, parker, enlisted, sidemen, gillespie, and, miles, davis, on, trumpet, curley, russell, on, bass, and, max, roach, on, drums, the, tracks, recorded, during, this, session, include, ko, ko, billie, s, bounce, and, now, s, the, time, in, december, 1945, the, parker, band, traveled, to, an, unsuccessful, engagement, at, billy, berg, s, club, in, los, angeles, most, of, the, group, returned, to, new, york, but, parker, remained, in, california, cashing, in, his, return, ticket, to, buy, heroin, however, after, parker, dedicated, one, of, his, compositions, to, local, drug, dealer, moose, the, mooche, at, a, studio, session, in, the, spring, the, dealer, was, arrested, and, without, access, to, heroin, parker, turned, to, an, alcohol, addiction, he, suffered, a, physical, and, mental, breakdown, after, a, studio, session, in, july, 1946, for, dial, records, and, was, briefly, jailed, after, setting, the, bed, sheets, of, his, los, angeles, hotel, room, on, fire, and, then, running, naked, through, the, lobby, while, intoxicated, after, which, he, was, committed, to, the, camarillo, state, mental, hospital, for, six, months, when, parker, received, his, discharge, from, the, hospital, he, was, healthy, and, free, from, his, drug, habit, before, leaving, california, he, recorded, relaxin, at, camarillo, in, reference, to, his, stay, in, the, mental, hospital, at, one, of, two, successful, recording, sessions, the, first, of, these, sessions, took, place, with, a, septet, while, the, second, paired, parker, with, pianist, erroll, garner, s, trio, and, vocalist, earl, coleman, upon, returning, to, new, york, in, 1947, however, parker, resumed, his, heroin, usage, he, recorded, dozens, of, sides, for, the, savoy, and, dial, labels, which, remain, some, of, the, high, points, of, his, recorded, output, many, of, these, were, with, his, new, quintet, including, davis, and, roach, parker, and, davis, disagreed, on, who, should, be, the, quintet, s, pianist, with, parker, originally, hiring, bud, powell, for, a, may, 1947, recording, session, but, later, favoring, gillespie, s, arranger, john, lewis, davis, preferred, duke, jordan, ultimately, the, quintet, used, both, pianists, as, parker, wanted, to, balance, leadership, of, the, group, with, mentoring, younger, musicians, such, as, davis, following, the, establishment, of, a, regular, quintet, parker, signed, for, mercury, records, with, jazz, at, the, philharmonic, promoter, norman, granz, as, his, producer, the, partnership, enabled, parker, to, work, with, musicians, from, other, genres, such, as, latin, jazz, percussionist, and, bandleader, machito, and, to, appear, in, concerts, at, carnegie, hall, as, part, of, the, jazz, at, the, philharmonic, series, further, granz, was, able, to, fulfil, a, longstanding, desire, of, parker, s, to, perform, with, a, string, section, he, was, a, keen, student, of, classical, music, and, contemporaries, reported, he, was, most, interested, in, the, music, and, formal, innovations, of, igor, stravinsky, and, longed, to, engage, in, a, project, akin, to, what, later, became, known, as, third, stream, a, new, kind, of, music, incorporating, both, jazz, and, classical, elements, as, opposed, to, merely, incorporating, a, string, section, into, performance, of, jazz, standards, on, november, 30, 1949, norman, granz, arranged, for, parker, to, record, an, album, of, ballads, with, a, mixed, group, of, jazz, and, chamber, orchestra, musicians, six, master, takes, from, this, session, became, the, album, charlie, parker, with, strings, just, friends, everything, happens, to, me, april, in, paris, summertime, i, didn, t, know, what, time, it, was, and, if, i, should, lose, you, in, 1950, parker, and, gillespie, recorded, bird, and, diz, an, album, that, proved, to, be, among, the, few, times, parker, worked, with, bebop, pianist, thelonious, monk, the, music, was, released, in, 1952, meanwhile, parker, s, regular, group, maintained, popular, success, with, a, european, tour, in, 1950, and, live, gigs, at, new, york, nightclubs, continued, leading, to, live, albums, one, night, in, birdland, with, fats, navarro, and, powell, and, summit, meeting, at, birdland, with, gillespie, and, powell, however, parker, became, frustrated, and, disillusioned, that, due, to, racial, discrimination, he, was, reaching, the, limits, of, what, he, would, be, able, to, achieve, in, his, career, in, 1953, parker, performed, at, massey, hall, in, toronto, joined, by, gillespie, mingus, powell, and, roach, the, concert, happened, at, the, same, time, as, a, televised, heavyweight, boxing, match, between, rocky, marciano, and, jersey, joe, walcott, so, the, musical, event, was, poorly, attended, mingus, recorded, the, concert, which, resulted, in, the, album, jazz, at, massey, hall, at, this, concert, parker, played, a, plastic, grafton, saxophone, other, live, and, often, bootleg, recordings, of, parker, were, made, in, the, early, 1950s, frequently, with, groups, other, than, his, usual, quintet, among, the, most, notable, of, these, recordings, particularly, from, the, perspective, of, critics, were, charlie, parker, in, sweden, recorded, during, his, 1950, sweden, tour, bird, at, st, nick, s, with, red, rodney, inglewood, jam, recorded, in, 1952, with, chet, baker, live, at, rockland, palace, recorded, live, with, his, quintet, and, string, accompaniment, charlie, parker, at, storyville, with, herb, pomeroy, and, red, garland, and, the, washington, concerts, recorded, unrehearsed, in, 1953, with, a, big, band, since, 1950, parker, had, been, living, in, new, york, city, with, his, common, law, wife, chan, berg, the, mother, of, his, son, baird, 1952, 2014, and, his, daughter, pree, who, died, at, age, 3, he, considered, chan, his, wife, although, he, never, married, her, nor, did, he, divorce, his, previous, wife, doris, whom, he, had, married, in, 1948, the, death, of, parker, s, daughter, pree, from, pneumonia, in, 1954, devastated, him, and, after, being, fired, from, birdland, in, september, of, that, year, he, attempted, to, commit, suicide, he, was, hospitalized, and, made, a, partial, recovery, by, early, 1955, before, his, health, declined, again, in, march, parker, s, last, gig, on, march, 4, at, birdland, ended, when, powell, refused, to, play, in, his, group, and, the, performance, spiraled, into, an, argument, among, the, musicians, parker, became, drunk, and, a, few, days, later, visited, the, suite, of, baroness, pannonica, at, the, stanhope, hotel, in, new, york, city, in, ill, health, he, refused, to, go, to, hospital, and, died, on, march, 12, 1955, while, watching, the, dorsey, brothers, stage, show, on, television, the, official, causes, of, death, were, lobar, pneumonia, and, a, bleeding, ulcer, but, parker, also, had, advanced, cirrhosis, and, had, suffered, a, heart, attack, and, a, seizure, the, coroner, who, performed, his, autopsy, mistakenly, estimated, parker, s, 34, year, old, body, to, be, between, 50, and, 60, years, of, age, the, details, surrounding, parker, s, death, were, controversial, doris, parker, claimed, that, she, parker, s, mother, and, art, blakey, were, aware, of, parker, s, death, before, march, 14, when, pannonica, claimed, she, first, revealed, the, news, on, a, phone, call, to, chan, pannonica, however, visited, a, nightclub, on, march, 13, the, day, after, parker, died, at, her, apartment, but, before, she, informed, chan, of, parker, s, death, further, newspapers, incorrectly, reported, parker, s, age, as, 53, when, he, died, and, parker, s, tombstone, incorrectly, claimed, that, he, died, on, march, 23, parker, s, marital, status, complicated, the, settling, of, parker, s, estate, and, ultimately, frustrated, his, wish, to, be, interred, in, new, york, city, dizzy, gillespie, paid, for, the, funeral, arrangements, which, included, a, harlem, procession, officiated, by, congressman, and, reverend, adam, clayton, powell, jr, at, the, abysinnian, baptist, church, and, a, memorial, concert, parker, s, body, was, flown, back, to, missouri, in, accordance, with, his, mother, s, wishes, chan, criticized, doris, and, parker, s, family, for, giving, him, a, christian, funeral, even, though, they, knew, he, was, an, atheist, parker, was, buried, at, lincoln, cemetery, in, missouri, in, a, hamlet, known, as, blue, summit, located, close, to, i, 435, and, east, truman, road, some, amount, of, controversy, continued, after, parker, s, burial, in, the, kansas, city, area, his, tomb, was, engraved, with, the, image, of, a, tenor, saxophone, though, parker, is, primarily, associated, with, the, alto, saxophone, later, some, people, wanted, to, move, parker, s, remains, to, reinforce, redevelopment, of, the, historic, 18th, and, vine, area, parker, acquired, the, nickname, yardbird, early, in, his, career, while, on, the, road, with, jay, mcshann, this, and, the, shortened, form, bird, were, used, as, nicknames, for, parker, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, inspired, the, titles, of, a, number, of, parker, s, compositions, such, as, yardbird, suite, ornithology, bird, gets, the, worm, and, bird, of, paradise, parker, s, life, was, riddled, with, mental, health, problems, and, an, addiction, to, heroin, although, it, is, unclear, which, came, first, his, addiction, to, opiates, began, at, the, age, of, 16, when, he, was, injured, in, a, car, crash, and, a, doctor, prescribed, morphine, for, the, pain, the, addiction, that, stemmed, from, this, incident, led, him, to, miss, performances, and, to, be, considered, unreliable, in, the, jazz, scene, heroin, use, was, prevalent, and, the, substance, could, be, acquired, with, little, difficulty, although, he, produced, many, brilliant, recordings, during, this, period, parker, s, behavior, became, increasingly, erratic, heroin, was, difficult, to, obtain, once, he, moved, to, california, where, the, drug, was, less, abundant, so, he, used, alcohol, as, a, substitute, a, recording, for, the, dial, label, from, july, 29, 1946, provides, evidence, of, his, condition, before, this, session, parker, drank, a, quart, of, whiskey, according, to, the, liner, notes, of, charlie, parker, on, dial, volume, 1, parker, missed, most, of, the, first, two, bars, of, his, first, chorus, on, the, track, max, making, wax, when, he, finally, did, come, in, he, swayed, wildly, and, once, spun, all, the, way, around, away, from, his, microphone, on, the, next, tune, lover, man, producer, ross, russell, physically, supported, parker, on, bebop, the, final, track, parker, recorded, that, evening, he, begins, a, solo, with, a, solid, first, eight, bars, on, his, second, eight, bars, however, he, begins, to, struggle, and, a, desperate, howard, mcghee, the, trumpeter, on, this, session, shouts, blow, at, him, charles, mingus, considered, this, version, of, lover, man, to, be, among, parker, s, greatest, recordings, despite, its, flaws, nevertheless, parker, hated, the, recording, and, never, forgave, ross, russell, for, releasing, it, he, re, recorded, the, tune, in, 1951, for, verve, parker, s, life, took, a, turn, for, the, worse, in, march, 1954, when, his, three, year, old, daughter, pree, died, of, cystic, fibrosis, and, pneumonia, he, attempted, suicide, twice, in, 1954, which, once, again, landed, him, in, a, mental, hospital, parker, s, style, of, composition, involved, interpolation, of, original, melodies, over, existing, jazz, forms, and, standards, a, practice, known, as, contrafact, and, still, common, in, jazz, today, examples, include, ornithology, which, borrows, the, chord, progression, of, jazz, standard, how, high, the, moon, and, is, said, to, be, co, written, with, trumpet, player, little, benny, harris, and, moose, the, mooche, one, of, many, parker, compositions, based, on, the, chord, progression, of, i, got, rhythm, the, practice, was, not, uncommon, prior, to, bebop, but, it, became, a, signature, of, the, movement, as, artists, began, to, move, away, from, arranging, popular, standards, and, toward, composing, their, own, material, perhaps, parker, s, most, well, known, contrafact, is, koko, which, is, based, on, the, chord, changes, of, the, popular, bebop, tune, cherokee, written, by, ray, noble, while, tunes, such, as, now, s, the, time, billie, s, bounce, au, privave, barbados, relaxin, at, camarillo, bloomdido, and, cool, blues, were, based, on, conventional, 12, bar, blues, changes, parker, also, created, a, unique, version, of, the, 12, bar, blues, for, tunes, such, as, blues, for, alice, laird, baird, and, si, si, these, unique, chords, are, known, popularly, as, bird, changes, like, his, solos, some, of, his, compositions, are, characterized, by, long, complex, melodic, lines, and, a, minimum, of, repetition, although, he, did, employ, the, use, of, repetition, in, some, tunes, most, notably, now, s, the, time, parker, contributed, greatly, to, the, modern, jazz, solo, one, in, which, triplets, and, pick, up, notes, were, used, in, unorthodox, ways, to, lead, into, chord, tones, affording, the, soloist, more, freedom, to, use, passing, tones, which, soloists, previously, avoided, his, recordings, were, used, for, a, book, of, solo, transcriptions, the, posthumously, published, charlie, parker, omnibook, other, well, known, parker, compositions, include, ah, leu, cha, anthropology, co, written, with, gillespie, confirmation, constellation, moose, the, mooche, scrapple, from, the, apple, and, yardbird, suite, the, vocal, version, of, which, is, called, what, price, love, with, lyrics, by, parker, miles, davis, once, said, you, can, tell, the, history, of, jazz, in, four, words, louis, armstrong, charlie, parker, grammy, award, grammy, hall, of, fame, recordings, of, charlie, parker, were, inducted, into, the, grammy, hall, of, fame, which, is, a, special, grammy, award, established, in, 1973, to, honor, recordings, that, are, at, least, twenty, five, years, old, and, that, have, qualitative, or, historical, significance, inductions, in, 1995,
