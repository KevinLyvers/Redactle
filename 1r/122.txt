grade, school, and, by, the, time, he, was, five, his, talent, with, drawing, was, already, apparent, he, readily, absorbed, his, father, s, intellectual, tendencies, and, love, of, french, and, russian, cultures, he, also, demonstrated, his, mother, s, artistic, heritage, hopper, s, parents, encouraged, his, art, and, kept, him, amply, supplied, with, materials, instructional, magazines, and, illustrated, books, hopper, first, began, signing, and, dating, his, drawings, at, the, age, of, 10, among, the, earliest, of, these, drawings, are, charcoal, sketches, of, geometric, shapes, a, vase, bowl, cup, and, boxes, the, detailed, examination, of, light, and, shadow, that, continued, throughout, his, career, is, already, visible, in, these, early, works, by, his, teens, he, was,

and, his, c, 1898, painting, ships, have, been, identified, as, copies, of, paintings, by, artists, including, bruce, crane, and, edward, moran, in, his, early, self, portraits, hopper, tended, to, represent, himself, as, skinny, ungraceful, and, homely, though, a, tall, and, quiet, teenager, his, prankish, sense, of, humor, found, outlet, in, his, art, sometimes, in, depictions, of, immigrants, or, of, women, dominating, men, in, comical, situations, later, in, life, he, mostly, depicted, women, as, the, figures, in, his, paintings, in, high, school, he, graduated, from, nyack, high, school, in, 1899, he, carved, wooden, models, of, sailboats, and, barges, and, dreamed, of, becoming, a, naval, architect, but, after, graduation, declared, his, intention, to, pursue, a, career, in, art, hopper, s, parents, insisted, that, he, study, commercial, art, to, have, a, reliable, means, of, income, in, developing, his, self, image, and, individualistic, philosophy, of, life, hopper, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, ralph, waldo, emerson, he, later, said, i, admire, him, greatly, i, read, him, over, and, over, again, hopper, began, art, studies, with, a, correspondence, course, in, 1899, soon, he, transferred, to, the, new, york, school, of, art, and, design, the, forerunner, of, parsons, school, of, design, there, he, studied, for, six, years, with, teachers, including, william, merritt, chase, who, instructed, him, in, oil, painting, early, on, hopper, modeled, his, style, after, chase, and, french, impressionist, masters, douard, manet, and, edgar, degas, sketching, from, live, models, however, proved, challenging, and, somewhat, shocking, for, the, conservatively, raised, hopper, another, of, his, teachers, artist, robert, henri, taught, life, class, henri, encouraged, his, students, to, use, their, art, to, make, a, stir, in, the, world, he, also, advised, his, students, it, isn, t, the, subject, that, counts, but, what, you, feel, about, it, and, forget, about, art, and, paint, pictures, of, what, interests, you, in, life, in, this, manner, henri, influenced, hopper, as, well, as, future, artists, george, bellows, and, rockwell, kent, he, encouraged, them, to, imbue, their, work, with, a, modern, spirit, some, artists, in, henri, s, circle, including, john, sloan, became, members, of, the, eight, also, known, as, the, ashcan, school, of, american, art, hopper, s, first, surviving, oil, painting, to, hint, at, his, use, of, interiors, as, a, theme, was, solitary, figure, in, a, theater, c, 1904, during, his, student, years, he, also, painted, dozens, of, nudes, still, life, studies, landscapes, and, portraits, including, self, portraits, in, 1905, hopper, landed, a, part, time, job, with, an, advertising, agency, where, he, created, cover, designs, for, trade, magazines, hopper, came, to, detest, illustration, he, was, bound, to, it, by, economic, necessity, until, the, mid, 1920s, he, temporarily, escaped, by, making, three, trips, to, europe, each, centered, in, paris, ostensibly, to, study, its, art, scene, in, fact, he, mostly, worked, alone, and, seemed, mostly, unaffected, by, the, new, currents, in, art, later, he, said, he, didn, t, remember, hearing, of, picasso, at, all, he, was, highly, impressed, by, rembrandt, particularly, his, night, watch, which, he, said, was, the, most, wonderful, thing, of, his, i, have, seen, it, s, past, belief, in, its, reality, hopper, began, painting, urban, and, architectural, scenes, in, a, dark, palette, then, he, shifted, to, the, lighter, shades, of, the, impressionists, before, returning, to, the, darker, palette, with, which, he, was, most, comfortable, he, later, said, i, got, over, that, and, later, things, done, in, paris, were, more, the, kind, of, things, i, do, now, hopper, spent, much, of, his, time, drawing, street, and, caf, scenes, and, going, to, the, theater, and, opera, unlike, many, of, his, contemporaries, who, imitated, the, abstract, cubist, experiments, hopper, was, attracted, to, realist, art, later, he, claimed, few, european, influences, other, than, rembrandt, goya, and, the, french, engraver, charles, meryon, whose, moody, paris, scenes, hopper, imitated, after, returning, from, his, last, european, trip, hopper, rented, a, studio, in, new, york, city, where, he, struggled, to, define, his, own, style, reluctantly, he, returned, to, illustration, to, support, himself, being, a, freelancer, hopper, was, forced, to, solicit, for, projects, and, had, to, knock, on, the, doors, of, magazine, and, agency, offices, to, find, business, his, painting, languished, it, s, hard, for, me, to, decide, what, i, want, to, paint, i, go, for, months, without, finding, it, sometimes, it, comes, slowly, his, fellow, illustrator, walter, tittle, described, hopper, s, depressed, emotional, state, in, sharper, terms, seeing, his, friend, suffering, from, long, periods, of, unconquerable, inertia, sitting, for, days, at, a, time, before, his, easel, in, helpless, unhappiness, unable, to, raise, a, hand, to, break, the, spell, from, february, 22, to, march, 5, 1912, he, was, included, in, the, exhibition, of, the, independents, a, group, of, artists, at, the, initiative, of, robert, henri, but, did, not, make, any, sales, in, 1912, hopper, traveled, to, gloucester, massachusetts, to, seek, some, inspiration, and, made, his, first, outdoor, paintings, in, america, he, painted, squam, light, the, first, of, many, lighthouse, paintings, to, come, in, 1913, at, the, armory, show, hopper, earned, 250, when, he, sold, his, first, painting, sailing, 1911, to, an, american, businessman, thomas, f, vietor, which, he, had, painted, over, an, earlier, self, portrait, hopper, was, thirty, one, and, although, he, hoped, his, first, sale, would, lead, to, others, in, short, order, his, career, would, not, catch, on, for, many, more, years, he, continued, to, participate, in, group, exhibitions, at, smaller, venues, such, as, the, macdowell, club, of, new, york, shortly, after, his, father, s, death, that, same, year, hopper, moved, to, the, 3, washington, square, north, apartment, in, the, greenwich, village, section, of, manhattan, where, he, would, live, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, following, year, he, received, a, commission, to, create, some, movie, posters, and, handle, publicity, for, a, movie, company, although, he, did, not, like, the, illustration, work, hopper, was, a, lifelong, devotee, of, the, cinema, and, the, theatre, both, of, which, he, treated, as, subjects, for, his, paintings, each, form, influenced, his, compositional, methods, at, an, impasse, over, his, oil, paintings, in, 1915, hopper, turned, to, etching, by, 1923, he, had, produced, most, of, his, approximately, 70, works, in, this, medium, many, of, urban, scenes, of, both, paris, and, new, york, he, also, produced, some, posters, for, the, war, effort, as, well, as, continuing, with, occasional, commercial, projects, when, he, could, hopper, did, some, outdoor, oil, paintings, on, visits, to, new, england, especially, at, the, art, colonies, at, ogunquit, and, monhegan, island, during, the, early, 1920s, his, etchings, began, to, receive, public, recognition, they, expressed, some, of, his, later, themes, as, in, night, on, the, el, train, couples, in, silence, evening, wind, solitary, female, and, the, catboat, simple, nautical, scene, two, notable, oil, paintings, of, this, time, were, new, york, interior, 1921, and, new, york, restaurant, 1922, he, also, painted, two, of, his, many, window, paintings, to, come, girl, at, sewing, machine, and, moonlight, interior, both, of, which, show, a, figure, clothed, or, nude, near, a, window, of, an, apartment, viewed, as, gazing, out, or, from, the, point, of, view, from, the, outside, looking, in, although, these, were, frustrating, years, hopper, gained, some, recognition, in, 1918, hopper, was, awarded, the, u, s, shipping, board, prize, for, his, war, poster, smash, the, hun, he, participated, in, three, exhibitions, in, 1917, with, the, society, of, independent, artists, in, january, 1920, a, one, man, exhibition, at, the, whitney, studio, club, which, was, the, precursor, to, the, whitney, museum, and, in, 1922, again, with, the, whitney, studio, club, in, 1923, hopper, received, two, awards, for, his, etchings, the, logan, prize, from, the, chicago, society, of, etchers, and, the, w, a, bryan, prize, by, 1923, hopper, s, slow, climb, finally, produced, a, breakthrough, he, re, encountered, josephine, nivison, an, artist, and, former, student, of, robert, henri, during, a, summer, painting, trip, in, gloucester, massachusetts, they, were, opposites, she, was, short, open, gregarious, sociable, and, liberal, while, he, was, tall, secretive, shy, quiet, introspective, and, conservative, with, jo, s, encouragement, hopper, turned, to, the, medium, of, watercolor, producing, numerous, scenes, of, gloucester, they, married, a, year, later, with, artist, guy, p, ne, du, bois, as, their, best, man, nivison, once, remarked, sometimes, talking, to, eddie, is, just, like, dropping, a, stone, in, a, well, except, that, it, doesn, t, thump, when, it, hits, bottom, she, subordinated, her, career, to, his, and, shared, his, reclusive, life, style, the, rest, of, their, lives, revolved, around, their, spare, walk, up, apartment, in, the, city, and, their, summers, in, south, truro, on, cape, cod, she, managed, his, career, and, his, interviews, was, his, primary, model, and, was, his, life, companion, with, nivison, s, help, six, of, hopper, s, gloucester, watercolors, were, admitted, to, an, exhibit, at, the, brooklyn, museum, in, 1923, one, of, them, the, mansard, roof, was, purchased, by, the, museum, for, its, permanent, collection, for, the, sum, of, 100, the, critics, generally, raved, about, his, work, one, stated, what, vitality, force, and, directness, observe, what, can, be, done, with, the, homeliest, subject, hopper, sold, all, his, watercolors, at, a, one, man, show, the, following, year, and, finally, decided, to, put, illustration, behind, him, the, artist, had, demonstrated, his, ability, to, transfer, his, attraction, to, parisian, architecture, to, american, urban, and, rural, architecture, according, to, boston, museum, of, fine, arts, curator, carol, troyen, hopper, really, liked, the, way, these, houses, with, their, turrets, and, towers, and, porches, and, mansard, roofs, and, ornament, cast, wonderful, shadows, hopper, always, said, that, his, favorite, thing, was, painting, sunlight, on, the, side, of, a, house, at, forty, one, hopper, received, further, recognition, for, his, work, he, continued, to, harbor, bitterness, about, his, career, later, turning, down, appearances, and, awards, with, his, financial, stability, secured, by, steady, sales, hopper, would, live, a, simple, stable, life, and, continue, creating, art, in, his, personal, style, for, four, more, decades, his, two, on, the, aisle, 1927, sold, for, a, personal, record, 1, 500, enabling, hopper, to, purchase, an, automobile, which, he, used, to, make, field, trips, to, remote, areas, of, new, england, in, 1929, he, produced, chop, suey, and, railroad, sunset, the, following, year, art, patron, stephen,

oil, around, 1930, although, josephine, posed, for, many, of, his, paintings, she, sat, for, only, one, formal, oil, portrait, by, her, husband, jo, painting, 1936, hopper, fared, better, than, many, other, artists, during, the, great, depression, his, stature, took, a, sharp, rise, in, 1931, when, major, museums, including, the, whitney, museum, of, american, art, and, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, paid, thousands, of, dollars, for, his, works, he, sold, 30, paintings, that, year, including, 13, watercolors, the, following, year, he, participated, in, the, first, whitney, annual, and, he, continued, to, exhibit, in, every, annual, at, the, museum, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1933, the, museum, of, modern, art, gave, hopper, his, first, large, scale, retrospective, in, 1930, the, hoppers, rented, a, cottage, in, south, truro, on, cape, cod, they, returned, every, summer, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, building, a, summer, house, there, in, 1934, from, there, they, would, take, driving, trips, into, other, areas, when, hopper, needed, to, search, for, fresh, material, to, paint, in, the, summers, of, 1937, and, 1938, the, couple, spent, extended, sojourns, on, wagon, wheels, farm, in, south, royalton, vermont, where, hopper, painted, a, series, of, watercolors, along, the, white, river, these, scenes, are, atypical, among, hopper, s, mature, works, as, most, are, pure, landscapes, devoid, of, architecture, or, human, figures, first, branch, of, the, white, river, 1938, now, in, the, museum, of, fine, arts, boston, is, the, best, known, of, hopper, s, vermont, landscapes, hopper, was, very, productive, through, the, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, producing, among, many, important, works, new, york, movie, 1939, girlie, show, 1941, nighthawks, 1942, hotel, lobby, 1943, and, morning, in, a, city, 1944, during, the, late, 1940s, however, he, suffered, a, period, of, relative, inactivity, he, admitted, i, wish, i, could, paint, more, i, get, sick, of, reading, and, going, to, the, movies, during, the, next, two, decades, his, health, faltered, and, he, had, several, prostate, surgeries, and, other, medical, problems, but, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, he, created, several, more, major, works, including, first, row, orchestra, 1951, as, well, as, morning, sun, and, hotel, by, a, railroad, both, in, 1952, and, intermission, in, 1963,

near, washington, square, in, new, york, city, on, may, 15, 1967, he, was, buried, two, days, later, in, the, family, plot, at, oak, hill, cemetery, in, nyack, new, york, his, place, of, birth, his, wife, died, ten, months, later, and, is, buried, with, him, edward, hopper, s, wife, josephine, bequeathed, their, joint, collection, of, over, three, thousand, pieces, to, the, whitney, museum, arthayer, sanborn, a, baptist, minister, that, frequently, visited, their, home, to, care, for, edward, s, sister, marion, came, into, possession, of, three, hundred, hopper, drawings, and, paintings, art, historian, gail, levin, has, highlighted, that, whereas, the, whitney, museum, has, extensive, documentation, of, how, josephine, distributed, their, couple, s, pieces, paintings, acquired, from, sanborn, lack, provenance, proving, the, family, willingly, gifted, the, trove, of, pieces, sanborn, reported, finding, in, their, attic, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, des, moines, art, center, and, art, institute, of, chicago, all, have, significant, collections, of, hopper, paintings, always, reluctant, to, discuss, himself, and, his, art, hopper, simply, said, the, whole, answer, is, there, on, the, canvas, hopper, was, stoic, and, fatalistic, a, quiet, introverted, man, with, a, gentle, sense, of, humor, and, a, frank, manner, hopper, was, someone, drawn, to, an, emblematic, anti, narrative, symbolism, who, painted, short, isolated, moments, of, configuration, saturated, with, suggestion, his, silent, spaces, and, uneasy, encounters, touch, us, where, we, are, most, vulnerable, and, have, a, suggestion, of, melancholy, that, melancholy, being, enacted, his, sense, of, color, revealed, him, as, a, pure, painter, as, he, turned, the, puritan, into, the, purist, in, his, quiet, canvasses, where, blemishes, and, blessings, balance, according, to, critic, lloyd, goodrich, he, was, an, eminently, native, painter, who, more, than, any, other, was, getting, more, of, the, quality, of, america, into, his, canvases, conservative, in, politics, and, social, matters, hopper, asserted, for, example, that, artists, lives, should, be, written, by, people, very, close, to, them, he, accepted, things, as, they, were, and, displayed, a, lack, of, idealism, cultured, and, sophisticated, he, was, well, read, and, many, of, his, paintings, show, figures, reading, he, was, generally, good, company, and, unperturbed, by, silences, though, sometimes, taciturn, grumpy, or, detached, he, was, always, serious, about, his, art, and, the, art, of, others, and, when, asked, would, return, frank, opinions, hopper, s, most, systematic, declaration, of, his, philosophy, as, an, artist, was, given, in, a, handwritten, note, titled, statement, submitted, in, 1953, to, the, journal, reality, great, art, is, the, outward, expression, of, an, inner, life, in, the, artist, and, this, inner, life, will, result, in, his, personal, vision, of, the, world, no, amount, of, skillful, invention, can, replace, the, essential, element, of, imagination, one, of, the, weaknesses, of, much, abstract, painting, is, the, attempt, to, substitute, the, inventions, of, the, human, intellect, for, a, private, imaginative, conception, the, inner, life, of, a, human, being, is, a, vast, and, varied, realm, and, does, not, concern, itself, alone, with, stimulating, arrangements, of, color, form, and, design, the, term, life, used, in, art, is, something, not, to, be, held, in, contempt, for, it, implies, all, of, existence, and, the, province, of, art, is, to, react, to, it, and, not, to, shun, it, painting, will, have, to, deal, more, fully, and, less, obliquely, with, life, and, nature, s, phenomena, before, it, can, again, become, great, though, hopper, claimed, that, he, didn, t, consciously, embed, psychological, meaning, in, his, paintings, he, was, deeply, interested, in, freud, and, the, power, of, the, subconscious, mind, he, wrote, in, 1939, so, much, of, every, art, is, an, expression, of, the, subconscious, that, it, seems, to, me, most, of, all, the, important, qualities, are, put, there, unconsciously, and, little, of, importance, by, the, conscious, intellect, although, he, is, best, known, for, his, oil, paintings, hopper, initially, achieved, recognition, for, his, watercolors, and, he, also, produced, some, commercially, successful, etchings, additionally, his, notebooks, contain, high, quality, pen, and, pencil, sketches, which, were, never, meant, for, public, viewing, hopper, paid, particular, attention, to, geometrical, design, and, the, careful, placement, of, human, figures, in, proper, balance, with, their, environment, he, was, a, slow, and, methodical, artist, as, he, wrote, it, takes, a, long, time, for, an, idea, to, strike, then, i, have, to, think, about, it, for, a, long, time, i, don, t, start, painting, until, i, have, it, all, worked, out, in, my, mind, i, m, all, right, when, i, get, to, the, easel, he, often, made, preparatory, sketches, to, work, out, his, carefully, calculated, compositions, he, and, his, wife, kept, a, detailed, ledger, of, their, works, noting, such, items, as, sad, face, of, woman, unlit, electric, light, from, ceiling, and, thighs, cooler, for, new, york, movie, 1939, hopper, demonstrates, his, thorough, preparation, with, more, than, 53, sketches, of, the, theater, interior, and, the, figure, of, the, pensive, usherette, the, effective, use, of, light, and, shadow, to, create, mood, is, also, central, to, hopper, s, methods, bright, sunlight, as, an, emblem, of, insight, or, revelation, and, the, shadows, it, casts, also, play, symbolically, powerful, roles, in, hopper, paintings, such, as, early, sunday, morning, 1930, summertime, 1943, seven, a, m, 1948, and, sun, in, an, empty, room, 1963, his, use, of, light, and, shadow, effects, have, been, compared, to, the, cinematography, of, film, noir, although, a, realist, painter, hopper, s, soft, realism, simplified, shapes, and, details, he, used, saturated, color, to, heighten, contrast, and, create, mood, hopper, derived, his, subject, matter, from, two, primary, sources, one, the, common, features, of, american, life, gas, stations, motels, restaurants, theaters, railroads, and, street, scenes, and, its, inhabitants, and, two, seascapes, and, rural, landscapes, regarding, his, style, hopper, defined, himself, as, an, amalgam, of, many, races, and, not, a, member, of, any, school, particularly, the, ashcan, school, once, hopper, achieved, his, mature, style, his, art, remained, consistent, and, self, contained, in, spite, of, the, numerous, art, trends, that, came, and, went, during, his, long, career, hopper, s, seascapes, fall, into, three, main, groups, pure, landscapes, of, rocks, sea, and, beach, grass, lighthouses, and, farmhouses, and, sailboats, sometimes, he, combined, these, elements, most, of, these, paintings, depict, strong, light, and, fair, weather, he, showed, little, interest, in, snow, or, rain, scenes, or, in, seasonal, color, changes, he, painted, the, majority, of, the, pure, seascapes, in, the, period, between, 1916, and, 1919, on, monhegan, island, hopper, s, the, long, leg, 1935, is, a, nearly, all, blue, sailing, picture, with, the, simplest, of, elements, while, his, ground, swell, 1939, is, more, complex, and, depicts, a, group, of, youngsters, out, for, a, sail, a, theme, reminiscent, of, winslow, homer, s, iconic, breezing, up, 1876, urban, architecture, and, cityscapes, also, were, major, subjects, for, hopper, he, was, fascinated, with, the, american, urban, scene, our, native, architecture, with, its, hideous, beauty, its, fantastic, roofs, pseudo, gothic, french, mansard, colonial, mongrel, or, what, not, with, eye, searing, color, or, delicate, harmonies, of, faded, paint, shouldering, one, another, along, interminable, streets, that, taper, off, into, swamps, or, dump, heaps, in, 1925, he, produced, house, by, the, railroad, this, classic, work, depicts, an, isolated, victorian, wood, mansion, partly, obscured, by, the, raised, embankment, of, a, railroad, it, marked, hopper, s, artistic, maturity, lloyd, goodrich, praised, the, work, as, one, of, the, most, poignant, and, desolating, pieces, of, realism, the, work, is, the, first, of, a, series, of, stark, rural, and, urban, scenes, that, uses, sharp, lines, and, large, shapes, played, upon, by, unusual, lighting, to, capture, the, lonely, mood, of, his, subjects, although, critics, and, viewers, interpret, meaning, and, mood, in, these, cityscapes, hopper, insisted, i, was, more, interested, in, the, sunlight, on, the, buildings, and, on, the, figures, than, any, symbolism, as, if, to, prove, the, point, his, late, painting, sun, in, an, empty, room, 1963, is, a, pure, study, of, sunlight, most, of, hopper, s, figure, paintings, focus, on, the, subtle, interaction, of, human, beings, with, their, environment, carried, out, with, solo, figures, couples, or, groups, his, primary, emotional, themes, are, solitude, loneliness, regret, boredom, and, resignation, he, expresses, the, emotions, in, various, environments, including, the, office, in, public, places, in, apartments, on, the, road, or, on, vacation, as, if, he, were, creating, stills, for, a, movie, or, tableaux, in, a, play, hopper, positioned, his, characters, as, if, they, were, captured, just, before, or, just, after, the, climax, of, a, scene, hopper, s, solitary, figures, are, mostly, women, dressed, semi, clad, and, nude, often, reading, or, looking, out, a, window, or, in, the, workplace, in, the, early, 1920s, hopper, painted, his, first, such, images, girl, at, sewing, machine, 1921, new, york, interior, another, woman, sewing, 1921, and, moonlight, interior, a, nude, getting, into, bed, 1923, automat, 1927, and, hotel, room, 1931, however, are, more, representative, of, his, mature, style, emphasizing, the, solitude, more, overtly, as, hopper, scholar, gail, levin, wrote, of, hotel, room, the, spare, vertical, and, diagonal, bands, of, color, and, sharp, electric, shadows, create, a, concise, and, intense, drama, in, the, night, combining, poignant, subject, matter, with, such, a, powerful, formal, arrangement, hopper, s, composition, is, pure, enough, to, approach, an, almost, abstract, sensibility, yet, layered, with, a, poetic, meaning, for, the, observer, hopper, s, room, in, new, york, 1932, and, cape, cod, evening, 1939, are, prime, examples, of, his, couple, paintings, in, the, first, a, young, couple, appear, alienated, and, uncommunicative, he, reading, the, newspaper, while, she, idles, by, the, piano, the, viewer, takes, on, the, role, of, a, voyeur, as, if, looking, with, a, telescope, through, the, window, of, the, apartment, to, spy, on, the, couple, s, lack, of, intimacy, in, the, latter, painting, an, older, couple, with, little, to, say, to, each, other, are, playing, with, their, dog, whose, own, attention, is, drawn, away, from, his, masters, hopper, takes, the, couple, theme, to, a, more, ambitious, level, with, excursion, into, philosophy, 1959, a, middle, aged, man, sits, dejectedly, on, the, edge, of, a, bed, beside, him, lies, an, open, book, and, a, partially, clad, woman, a, shaft, of, light, illuminates, the, floor, in, front, of, him, jo, hopper, noted, in, their, log, book, he, open, book, is, plato, reread, too, late, levin, interprets, the, painting, plato, s, philosopher, in, search, of, the, real, and, the, true, must, turn, away, from, this, transitory, realm, and, contemplate, the, eternal, forms, and, ideas, the, pensive, man, in, hopper, s, painting, is, positioned, between, the, lure, of, the, earthly, domain, figured, by, the, woman, and, the, call, of, the, higher, spiritual, domain, represented, by, the, ethereal, lightfall, the, pain, of, thinking, about, this, choice, and, its, consequences, after, reading, plato, all, night, is, evident, he, is, paralysed, by, the, fervent, inner, labour, of, the, melancholic, in, office, at, night, 1940, another, couple, painting, hopper, creates, a, psychological, puzzle, the, painting, shows, a, man, focusing, on, his, work, papers, while, nearby, his, attractive, female, secretary, pulls, a, file, several, studies, for, the, painting, show, how, hopper, experimented, with, the, positioning, of, the, two, figures, perhaps, to, heighten, the, eroticism, and, the, tension, hopper, presents, the, viewer, with, the, possibilities, that, the, man, is, either, truly, uninterested, in, the, woman, s, appeal, or, that, he, is, working, hard, to, ignore, her, another, interesting, aspect, of, the, painting, is, how, hopper, employs, three, light, sources, from, a, desk, lamp, through, a, window, and, indirect, light, from, above, hopper, went, on, to, make, several, office, pictures, but, no, others, with, a, sensual, undercurrent, the, best, known, of, hopper, s, paintings, nighthawks, 1942, is, one, of, his, paintings, of, groups, it, shows, customers, sitting, at, the, counter, of, an, all, night, diner, the, shapes, and, diagonals, are, carefully, constructed, the, viewpoint, is, cinematic, from, the, sidewalk, as, if, the, viewer, were, approaching, the, restaurant, the, diner, s, harsh, electric, light, sets, it, apart, from, the, dark, night, outside, enhancing, the, mood, and, subtle, emotion, as, in, many, hopper, paintings, the, interaction, is, minimal, the, restaurant, depicted, was, inspired, by, one, in, greenwich, village, both, hopper, and, his, wife, posed, for, the, figures, and, jo, hopper, gave, the, painting, its, title, the, inspiration, for, the, picture, may, have, come, from, ernest, hemingway, s, short, story, the, killers, which, hopper, greatly, admired, or, from, the, more, philosophical, a, clean, well, lighted, place, the, mood, of, the, painting, has, sometimes, been, interpreted, as, an, expression, of, wartime, anxiety, in, keeping, with, the, title, of, his, painting, hopper, later, said, nighthawks, has, more, to, do, with, the, possibility, of, predators, in, the, night, than, with, loneliness, his, second, most, recognizable, painting, after, nighthawks, is, another, urban, painting, early, sunday, morning, originally, called, seventh, avenue, shops, which, shows, an, empty, street, scene, in, sharp, side, light, with, a, fire, hydrant, and, a, barber, pole, as, stand, ins, for, human, figures, originally, hopper, intended, to, put, figures, in, the, upstairs, windows, but, left, them, empty, to, heighten, the, feeling, of, desolation, hopper, s, rural, new, england, scenes, such, as, gas, 1940, are, no, less, meaningful, gas, represents, a, different, equally, clean, well, lighted, refuge, ke, open, for, those, in, need, as, they, navigate, the, night, traveling, their, own, miles, to, go, before, they, sleep, the, work, presents, a, fusion, of, several, hopper, themes, the, solitary, figure, the, melancholy, of, dusk, and, the, lonely, road, hopper, s, rooms, by, the, sea, 1951, shows, an, open, door, with, a, view, of, the, ocean, without, an, apparent, ladder, or, steps, and, no, indication, of, a, beach, after, his, student, years, hopper, s, nudes, were, all, women, unlike, past, artists, who, painted, the, female, nude, to, glorify, the, female, form, and, to, highlight, female, eroticism, hopper, s, nudes, are, solitary, women, who, are, psychologically, exposed, one, audacious, exception, is, girlie, show, 1941, where, a, red, headed, strip, tease, queen, strides, confidently, across, a, stage, to, the, accompaniment, of, the, musicians, in, the, pit, girlie, show, was, inspired, by, hopper, s, visit, to, a, burlesque, show, a, few, days, earlier, hopper, s, wife, as, usual, posed, for, him, for, the, painting, and, noted, in, her, diary, ed, beginning, a, new, canvas, a, burlesque, queen, doing, a, strip, tease, and, i, posing, without, a, stitch, on, in, front, of, the, stove, nothing, but, high, heels, in, a, lottery, dance, pose, hopper, s, portraits, and, self, portraits, were, relatively, few, after, his, student, years, hopper, did, produce, a, commissioned, portrait, of, a, house, the, macarthurs, home, 1939, where, he, faithfully, details, the, victorian, architecture, of, the, home, of, actress, helen, hayes, she, reported, later, i, guess, i, never, met, a, more, misanthropic, grumpy, individual, in, my, life, hopper, grumbled, throughout, the, project, and, never, again, accepted, a, commission, hopper, also, painted, portrait, of, orleans, 1950, a, portrait, of, the, cape, cod, town, from, its, main, street, though, very, interested, in, the, american, civil, war, and, mathew, brady, s, battlefield, photographs, hopper, made, only, two, historical, paintings, both, depicted, soldiers, on, their, way, to, gettysburg, also, rare, among, his, themes, are, paintings, showing, action, the, best, example, of, an, action, painting, is, bridle, path, 1939, but, hopper, s, struggle, with, the, proper, anatomy, of, the, horses, may, have, discouraged, him, from, similar, attempts, hopper, s, final, oil, painting, two, comedians, 1966, painted, one, year, before, his, death, focuses, on, his, love, of, the, theater, two, french, pantomime, actors, one, male, and, one, female, both, dressed, in, bright, white, costumes, take, their, bow, in, front, of, a, darkened, stage, jo, hopper, confirmed, that, her, husband, intended, the, figures, to, suggest, they, are, taking, their, life, s, last, bows, together, as, husband, and, wife, hopper, s, paintings, have, often, been, seen, by, others, as, having, a, narrative, or, thematic, content, that, the, artist, may, not, have, intended, much, meaning, can, be, added, to, a, painting, by, its, title, but, the, titles, of, hopper, s, paintings, were, sometimes, chosen, by, others, or, were, selected, by, hopper, and, his, wife, in, a, way, that, makes, it, unclear, whether, they, have, any, real, connection, with, the, artist, s, meaning, for, example, hopper, once, told, an, interviewer, that, he, was, fond, of, early, sunday, morning, but, it, wasn, t, necessarily, sunday, that, word, was, tacked, on, later, by, someone, else, the, tendency, to, read, thematic, or, narrative, content, into, hopper, s, paintings, that, hopper, had, not, intended, extended, even, to, his, wife, when, jo, hopper, commented, on, the, figure, in, cape, cod, morning, it, s, a, woman, looking, out, to, see, if, the, weather, s, good, enough, to, hang, out, her, wash, hopper, retorted, did, i, say, that, you, re, making, it, norman, rockwell, from, my, point, of, view, she, s, just, looking, out, the, window, another, example, of, the, same, phenomenon, is, recorded, in, a, 1948, article, in, time, hopper, s, summer, evening, a, young, couple, talking, in, the, harsh, light, of, a, cottage, porch, is, inescapably, romantic, but, hopper, was, hurt, by, one, critic, s, suggestion, that, it, would, do, for, an, illustration, in, any, woman, s, magazine, hopper, had, the, painting, in, the, back, of, his, head, for, 20, years, and, i, never, thought, of, putting, the, figures, in, until, i, actually, started, last, summer, why, any, art, director, would, tear, the, picture, apart, the, figures, were, not, what, interested, me, it, was, the, light, streaming, down, and, the, night, all, around, in, focusing, primarily, on, quiet, moments, very, rarely, showing, action, hopper, employed, a, form, of, realism, adopted, by, another, leading, american, realist, andrew, wyeth, but, hopper, s, technique, was, completely, different, from, wyeth, s, hyper, detailed, style, in, league, with, some, of, his, contemporaries, hopper, shared, his, urban, sensibility, with, john, sloan, and, george, bellows, but, avoided, their, overt, action, and, violence, where, joseph, stella, and, georgia, o, keeffe, glamorized, the, monumental, structures, of, the, city, hopper, reduced, them, to, everyday, geometrics, and, he, depicted, the, pulse, of, the, city, as, desolate, and, dangerous, rather, than, elegant, or, seductive, charles, burchfield, whom, hopper, admired, and, to, whom, he, was, compared, said, of, hopper, he, achieves, such, a, complete, verity, that, you, can, read, into, his, interpretations, of, houses, and, conceptions, of, new, york, life, any, human, implications, you, wish, he, also, attributed, hopper, s, success, to, his, bold, individualism, in, him, we, have, regained, that, sturdy, american, independence, which, thomas, eakins, gave, us, but, which, for, a, time, was, lost, hopper, considered, this, a, high, compliment, since, he, considered, eakins, the, greatest, american, painter, hopper, scholar, deborah, lyons, writes, our, own, moments, of, revelation, are, often, mirrored, transcendent, in, his, work, once, seen, hopper, s, interpretations, exist, in, our, consciousness, in, tandem, with, our, own, experience, we, forever, see, a, certain, type, of, house, as, a, hopper, house, invested, perhaps, with, a, mystery, that, hopper, implanted, in, our, own, vision, hopper, s, paintings, highlight, the, seemingly, mundane, and, typical, scenes, in, our, everyday, life, and, give, them, cause, for, epiphany, in, this, way, hopper, s, art, takes, the, gritty, american, landscape, and, lonely, gas, stations, and, creates, within, them, a, sense, of, beautiful, anticipation, although, compared, to, his, contemporary, norman, rockwell, in, terms, of, subject, matter, hopper, did, not, like, the, comparison, hopper, considered, himself, more, subtle, less, illustrative, and, certainly, not, sentimental, hopper, also, rejected, comparisons, with, grant, wood, and, thomas, hart, benton, stating, i, think, the, american, scene, painters, caricatured, america, i, always, wanted, to, do, myself, hopper, s, influence, on, the, art, world, and, pop, culture, is, undeniable, see, in, popular, culture, for, numerous, examples, though, he, had, no, formal, students, many, artists, have, cited, him, as, an, influence, including, willem, de, kooning, jim, dine, and, mark, rothko, an, illustration, of, hopper, s, influence, is, rothko, s, early, work, composition, i, c, 1931, which, is, a, direct, paraphrase, of, hopper, s, chop, suey, hopper, s, cinematic, compositions, and, dramatic, use, of, light, and, dark, have, made, him, a, favorite, among, filmmakers, for, example, house, by, the, railroad, is, reported, to, have, heavily, influenced, the, iconic, house, in, the, alfred, hitchcock, film, psycho, the, same, painting, has, also, been, cited, as, being, an, influence, on, the, home, in, the, terrence, malick, film, days, of, heaven, the, 1981, film, pennies, from, heaven, includes, a, tableau, vivant, of, nighthawks, with, the, lead, actors, in, the, places, of, the, diners, german,

sought, to, shed, light, on, the, complexity, of, his, masterpieces, which, is, an, indication, of, the, richness, of, hopper, s, oeuvre, it, was, divided, chronologically, into, two, main, parts, the, first, section, covered, hopper, s, formative, years, 1900, 1924, comparing, his, work, with, that, of, his, contemporaries, and, art, he, saw, in, paris, which, may, have, influenced, him, the, second, section, looked, at, the, art, of, his, mature, years, from, the, first, paintings, emblematic, of, his, personal, style, such, as, house, by, the, railroad, 1924, to, his, last, works, in, 2020, fondation, beyeler, held, an, exhibition, displaying, hopper, s, art, the, exhibition, focused, on, hopper, s, iconic, representations, of, the, infinite, expanse, of, american, landscapes, and, cityscapes, this, aspect, has, rarely, been, referred, to, in, exhibitions, yet, it, is, a, key, ingredient, to, understanding, hopper, s, work, from, 2022, to, 2023, his, work, was, featured, at, the, whitney, museum, in, new, york, city, in, an, exhibition, was, entitled, edward, hopper, s, new, york, works, by, hopper, rarely, appear, on, the, market, the, artist, was, not, prolific, painting, just, 366, canvases, during, the, 1950s, when, he, was, in, his, 70s, he, produced, approximately, five, paintings, a, year, hopper, s, longtime, dealer, frank, rehn, who, gave, the, artist,
