and, dennis, hopper, after, first, reading, the, script, fonda, told, nicholson, he, was, impressed, by, the, writing, and, felt, it, could, become, a, great, film, but, fonda, was, disappointed, with, how, the, film, turned, out, and, blamed, the, editing, for, turning, it, into, a, predictable, film, and, said, so, publicly, i, was, livid, he, recalls, nicholson, also, co, wrote, with, bob, rafelson, the, movie, head, which, starred, the, monkees, and, arranged, the, movie, s, soundtrack, nicholson, s, first, big, acting, break, came, when, a, role, opened, up, in, fonda, and, hopper, s,

grossing, 40, million, biographer, john, parker, writes, that, nicholson, s, interpretation, of, his, role, placed, him, in, the, company, of, earlier, antihero, actors, such, as, james, cagney, and, humphrey, bogart, while, promoting, him, into, an, overnight, number, one, hero, of, the, counter, culture, movement, the, part, was, a, lucky, break, for, nicholson, the, role, had, been, written, for, rip, torn, who, withdrew, from, the, project, after, an, argument, with, hopper, nicholson, later, acknowledged, the, importance, of, being, cast, in, easy, rider, all, i, could, see, in, the, early, films, before, easy, rider, was, this, desperate, young, actor, trying, to, vault, out, of, the, screen, and, create, a, movie, career, stanley, kubrick, who, was, impressed, by, his, performance, in, easy, rider, cast, nicholson, as, napoleon, in, a, film, about, his, life, and, although, production, on, the, film, commenced, the, project, fizzled, out, partly, due, to, a, change, in, ownership, at, mgm, in, 1970, nicholson, starred, in, five, easy, pieces, alongside, karen, black, in, what, became, his, persona, defining, role, nicholson, and, black, were, nominated, for, academy, awards, for, their, performances, nicholson, played, bobby, dupea, an, oil, rig, worker, and, black, played, his, waitress, girlfriend, black, noted, that, nicholson, s, character, in, the, film, was, very, subdued, and, very, different, from, nicholson, s, real, personality, she, said, that, the, now, infamous, restaurant, scene, was, partly, improvised, by, nicholson, and, was, out, of, character, for, bobby, who, would, not, have, cared, enough, to, argue, with, a, waitress, i, think, that, jack, really, has, very, little, in, common, with, bobby, i, think, bobby, has, given, up, looking, for, love, but, jack, hasn, t, he, s, very, interested, in, love, in, finding, out, things, jack, is, a, very, curious, alive, human, being, always, ready, for, a, new, idea, 37, nicholson, himself, said, as, much, telling, an, interviewer, i, like, listening, to, everybody, this, to, me, is, the, elixir, of, life, there, is, james, cagney, spencer, tracy, humphrey, bogart, and, henry, fonda, after, that, who, is, there, but, jack, nicholson, mike, nichols, director, black, later, admitted, that, she, had, a, crush, on, nicholson, from, the, time, they, met, although, they, dated, only, briefly, he, was, very, beautiful, he, just, looked, right, at, you, i, liked, him, a, lot, he, really, sort, of, wanted, to, date, me, but, i, didn, t, think, of, him, that, way, because, i, was, going, with, peter, kastner, then, i, went, to, do, easy, rider, but, didn, t, see, him, because, we, didn, t, have, any, scenes, together, at, the, premiere, i, saw, him, out, in, the, lobby, afterward, and, i, started, crying, he, didn, t, understand, that, but, what, it, was, was, that, i, really, loved, him, a, lot, and, i, didn, t, know, it, until, i, saw, him, again, because, it, all, welled, up, 36, within, a, month, after, its, release, that, september, five, easy, pieces, became, a, blockbuster, making, nicholson, a, leading, man, and, the, new, american, anti, hero, according, to, mcdougal, 130, critics, began, speculating, as, to, whether, he, might, become, another, marlon, brando, or, james, dean, his, career, and, income, skyrocketed, he, said, i, have, much, sought, after, your, name, becomes, a, brand, image, like, a, product, you, become, campbell, s, soup, with, thirty, one, different, varieties, of, roles, you, can, play, 130, he, told, his, new, agent, sandy, bresler, to, find, him, unusual, roles, so, he, could, stretch, his, acting, skill, i, like, to, play, people, that, haven, t, existed, yet, a, cusp, character, he, said, i, have, that, creative, yearning, much, in, the, way, chagall, flies, figures, into, the, air, once, it, becomes, part, of, the, conventional, wisdom, it, doesn, t, seem, particularly, adventurous, or, weird, or, wild, 130, also, in, 1970, nicholson, appeared, in, the, film, adaptation, of, on, a, clear, day, you, can, see, forever, although, most, of, his, performance, was, left, on, the, cutting, room, floor, his, agent, turned, down, a, starring, role, in, deliverance, when, the, film, s, producer, and, director, john, boorman, refused, to, pay, what, nicholson, s, agent, wanted, 130, in, 1971,

globe, award, for, best, actor, nichols, felt, few, actors, could, handle, the, role, saying, there, is, james, cagney, spencer, tracy, humphrey, bogart, and, henry, fonda, after, that, who, is, there, but, jack, nicholson, during, the, filming, nicholson, struck, up, what, became, a, lifelong, friendship, with, garfunkel, when, he, visited, los, angeles, garfunkel, stayed, at, nicholson, s, home, in, a, room, nicholson, jokingly, called, the, arthur, garfunkel, suite, 127, other, nicholson, roles, included, hal, ashby, s, the, last, detail, 1973, with, randy, quaid, for, which, nicholson, won, best, actor, at, the, cannes, film, festival, and, was, nominated, for, his, third, oscar, and, a, golden, globe, television, journalist, david, gilmour, writes, that, one, of, his, favorite, nicholson, scenes, from, all, his, films, was, the, often, censored, one, in, this, film, when, nicholson, slaps, his, gun, on, the, bar, yelling, he, was, the, shore, patrol, critic, roger, ebert, called, it, a, very, good, movie, but, credited, nicholson, s, acting, as, the, main, reason, he, creates, a, character, so, complete, and, so, complex, that, we, stop, thinking, about, the, movie, and, just, watch, to, see, what, he, ll, do, next, in, 1974, nicholson, starred, in, roman, polanski, s, noir, thriller, chinatown, and, was, again, nominated, for, the, academy, award, for, best, actor, for, his, role, as, jake, gittes, a, private, detective, the, film, co, starred, faye, dunaway, and, john, huston, and, included, a, cameo, role, with, polanski, ebert, called, nicholson, s, portrayal, sharp, edged, menacing, and, aggressive, a, character, who, knew, how, to, go, over, the, top, as, he, did, in, one, flew, over, the, cuckoo, s, nest, that, edge, kept, chinatown, from, becoming, a, typical, genre, crime, film, ebert, also, notes, the, importance, of, the, role, for, nicholson, s, career, seeing, it, as, a, major, transition, from, the, exploitation, films, of, the, previous, decade, as, jake, gittes, he, stepped, into, bogart, s, shoes, says, ebert, as, a, man, attractive, to, audiences, because, he, suggests, both, comfort, and, danger, from, gittes, forward, nicholson, created, the, persona, of, a, man, who, had, seen, it, all, and, was, still, capable, of, being, wickedly, amused, nicholson, had, been, friends, with, polanski, long, before, the, murder, of, polanski, s, wife, sharon, tate, by, the, manson, family, and, supported, him, in, the, days, following, her, death, 109, 110, after, tate, s, death, nicholson, began, sleeping, with, a, hammer, under, his, pillow, and, took, breaks, from, work, to, attend, manson, s, trial, in, 1977, three, years, after, chinatown, polanski, was, arrested, at, nicholson, s, home, for, the, sexual, assault, of, 13, year, old, samantha, geimer, who, was, modeling, for, polanski, during, a, magazine, photo, shoot, around, the, pool, at, the, time, nicholson, was, out, of, town, making, a, film, but, his, steady, girlfriend, actress, anjelica, huston, had, dropped, by, unannounced, to, pick, up, some, items, she, heard, polanski, in, the, other, room, say, we, ll, be, right, out, polanski, then, came, out, with, geimer, and, introduced, her, to, huston, and, they, chatted, about, nicholson, s, two, large, dogs, which, were, sitting, nearby, huston, recalled, geimer, was, wearing, platform, heels, and, appeared, quite, tall, after, a, few, minutes, of, talking, polanski, had, packed, up, his, camera, gear, and, huston, saw, them, drive, off, in, his, car, huston, told, police, the, next, day, after, polanski, was, arrested, that, she, had, witnessed, nothing, untoward, and, never, saw, them, together, in, the, other, room, geimer, learned, afterward, that, huston, herself, was, not, supposed, to, be, at, nicholson, s, house, that, day, since, they, had, recently, broken, up, but, stopped, over, to, pick, up, some, belongings, geimer, described, nicholson, s, house, as, definitely, a, guy, s, house, with, lots, of, wood, and, shelves, crowded, with, photos, and, mementos, one, of, nicholson, s, successes, came, in, 1975, with, his, role, as, randle, p, mcmurphy, in, one, flew, over, the, cuckoo, s, nest, the, movie, was, an, adaptation, of, ken, kesey, s, novel, of, the, same, name, and, was, directed, by, milo, forman, and, co, produced, by, michael, douglas,

in, an, early, role, nicholson, learned, afterward, that, devito, grew, up, in, the, same, area, of, new, jersey, and, they, knew, many, of, the, same, people, the, film, received, nine, nominations, at, the, academy, awards, and, won, five, including, nicholson, s, first, for, best, actor, the, role, seemed, perfect, for, nicholson, with, biographer, ken, burke, noting, that, his, smartass, demeanor, balances, his, genuine, concern, for, the, treatment, of, his, fellow, patients, with, his, independent, spirit, too, free, to, exist, in, a, repressive, social, structure, forman, allowed, nicholson, to, improvise, throughout, the, film, including, most, of, the, group, therapy, sequences, 273, reviewer, marie, brenner, notes, that, his, bravura, performance, transcends, the, screen, and, continually, inspires, the, other, actors, by, lightening, their, mental, illnesses, with, his, comic, dialogue, she, describes, his, performance, nicholson, is, everywhere, his, energy, propels, the, ward, of, loonies, and, makes, of, them, an, ensemble, a, chorus, of, people, caught, in, a, bummer, with, nowhere, else, to, go, but, still, fighting, for, some, frail, sense, of, themselves, there, are, scenes, in, cuckoo, s, nest, that, are, as, intimate, and, in, their, language, twice, as, rough, as, the, best, moments, in, the, godfather, far, above, the, general, run, of, hollywood, performances, marie, brenner, texas, monthly, also, in, 1975, nicholson, starred, in, michelangelo, antonioni, s, the, passenger, 1975, which, co, starred, maria, schneider, nicholson, plays, a, journalist, david, locke, who, during, an, assignment, in, north, africa, decides, to, quit, journalism, and, disappear, by, taking, on, a, new, hidden, identity, unfortunately, the, dead, person, whose, identity, he, takes, on, turns, out, to, have, been, a, weapons, smuggler, on, the, run, antonioni, s, unusual, plot, included, convincing, dialogue, and, fine, acting, states, film, critic, seymour, chatman, it, was, shot, in, algeria, spain, germany, and, england, the, film, received, good, reviews, and, revived, antonioni, s, reputation, as, a, great, director, he, said, he, wanted, the, film, to, have, more, of, a, spy, feeling, be, more, political, nicholson, began, shooting, the, film, from, an, unfinished, script, notes, judith, crist, yet, upon, its, completion, he, thought, so, highly, of, the, film, that, he, bought, the, world, rights, and, recorded, a, reminiscence, of, working, with, antonioni, critic, and, screenwriter, penelope, gilliatt, provides, an, overview, of, nicholson, s, role, the, passenger, is, an, unidealized, portrait, of, a, drained, man, whose, one, remaining, stimulus, is, to, push, his, luck, again, and, again, in, the, movie, we, watch, him, court, danger, it, interests, him, to, walk, the, edge, of, risk, he, does, it, with, passivity, as, if, he, were, taking, part, in, an, expressionless, game, of, double, dare, with, life, jack, nicholson, s, performance, is, a, wonder, of, insight, how, to, animate, a, personality, that, is, barely, there, 443, nicholson, continued, to, take, more, unusual, roles, he, took, a, small, role, in, the, last, tycoon, opposite, robert, de, niro, he, took, a, less, sympathetic, role, in, arthur, penn, s, western, the, missouri, breaks, 1976, specifically, to, work, with, marlon, brando, nicholson, was, especially, inspired, by, brando, s, acting, ability, recalling, that, in, his, youth, as, an, assistant, manager, at, a, theater, he, watched, on, the, waterfront, about, 40, times, he, once, stated, marlon, brando, influenced, me, strongly, today, it, s, hard, for, people, who, weren, t, there, to, realize, the, impact, that, brando, had, on, an, audience, he, s, always, been, the, patron, saint, of, actors, i, m, part, of, the, first, generation, that, idolized, marlon, brando, he, said, nicholson, has, observed, that, while, both, de, niro, and, brando, were, noted, for, their, skill, as, method, actors, he, himself, has, seldom, been, described, as, one, a, fact, he, sees, as, an, accomplishment, i, m, still, fooling, them, he, told, sean, penn, i, consider, it, an, accomplishment, because, there, s, probably, no, one, who, understands, method, acting, better, academically, than, i, do, or, actually, uses, it, more, in, his, work, but, it, s, funny, nobody, really, sees, that, it, s, perception, versus, reality, i, guess, his, work, is, always, interesting, clearly, conceived, and, has, the, x, factor, magic, jack, is, particularly, suited, for, roles, that, require, intelligence, he, is, an, intelligent, and, literate, man, and, these, are, almost, impossible, to, act, in, the, shining, you, believe, he, s, a, writer, failed, or, otherwise, stanley, kubrick, although, he, garnered, no, academy, award, for, stanley, kubrick, s, adaptation, of, stephen, king, s, the, shining, 1980, his, role, in, the, film, as, writer, jack, torrance, remains, one, of, his, more, significant, he, was, kubrick, s, first, choice, to, play, the, role, although, the, book, s, author, stephen, king, wanted, more, of, an, everyman, kubrick, won, the, argument, and, called, nicholson, s, acting, on, a, par, with, the, greatest, stars, of, the, past, like, spencer, tracy, and, jimmy, cagney, in, preparation, for, the, role, nicholson, drew, upon, his, own, experiences, as, a, writer, and, slept, short, hours, to, help, remain, in, an, agitated, state, during, the, shoot, his, co, star, shelley, duvall, recalled, that, she, and, nicholson, spent, many, hours, discussing, their, characters, with, nicholson, maintaining, that, his, character, be, cold, to, her, from, the, start, on, the, set, nicholson, always, appeared, in, character, and, if, kubrick, felt, confident, that, nicholson, knew, his, lines, well, enough, he, encouraged, him, to, improvise, beyond, the, script, 434, for, example, nicholson, improvised, his, now, famous, here, s, johnny, line, 433, along, with, a, scene, in, which, he, unleashes, his, anger, on, his, wife, when, she, interrupts, his, work, 445, there, were, also, extensive, takes, of, scenes, due, to, kubrick, s, perfectionism, nicholson, shot, a, scene, with, the, ghostly, bartender, 36, times, he, said, stanley, s, demanding, he, ll, do, a, scene, fifty, times, and, you, have, to, be, good, to, do, that, 38, in, 1982, he, starred, as, an, immigration, enforcement, agent, in, the, border, directed, by, tony, richardson, it, co, starred, warren, oates, who, played, a, corrupt, border, official, richardson, wanted, nicholson, to, play, his, role, less, expressively, than, he, had, in, his, earlier, roles, less, is, more, he, told, him, and, wanted, him, to, wear, reflecting,
