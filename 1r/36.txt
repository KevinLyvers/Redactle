she, took, vivian, leigh, as, her, professional, name, gliddon, recommended, her, to, alexander, korda, as, a, possible, film, actress, but, korda, rejected, her, as, lacking, potential, she, was,

error, and, signed, her, to, a, film, contract, she, continued, with, the, play, but, when, korda, moved, it, to, a, larger, theatre, leigh, was, found, to, be, unable, to, project, her, voice, adequately, or, to, hold, the, attention, of, so, large, an, audience, and, the, play, closed, soon, after, in, the, playbill, carroll, had, revised, the, spelling, of, her, first, name, to, vivien, in, 1960, leigh, recalled, her, ambivalence, towards, her, first, experience, of, critical, acclaim, and, sudden, fame, commenting, that, some, critics, saw, fit, to, be, as, foolish, as, to, say, that, i, was, a, great, actress, and, i, thought, that, was, a, foolish, wicked, thing, to, say, because, it, put, such, an, onus, and, such, a, responsibility, onto, me, which, i, simply, wasn, t, able, to, carry, and, it, took, me, years, to, learn, enough, to, live, up, to, what, they, said, for, those, first, notices, i, find, it, so, stupid, i, remember, the, critic, very, well, and, have, never, forgiven, him, in, the, autumn, of, 1935, and, at, leigh, s, insistence, john, buckmaster, introduced, her, to, laurence, olivier, at, the, savoy, grill, where, he, and, his, first, wife, jill, esmond, dined, regularly, after, his, performance, in, romeo, and, juliet, olivier, had, seen, leigh, in, the, mask, of, virtue, earlier, in, may, and, congratulated, her, on, her, performance, olivier, and, leigh, began, an, affair, while, acting, as, lovers, in, fire, over, england, 1937, while, olivier, was, still, married, to, esmond, and, leigh, to, holman, during, this, period, leigh, read, the, margaret, mitchell, novel, gone, with, the, wind, and, instructed, her, american, agent, to, recommend, her, to, david, o, selznick, who, was, planning, a, film, version, she, remarked, to, a, journalist, i, ve, cast, myself, as, scarlett, o, hara, and, the, observer, film, critic, c, a, lejeune, recalled, a, conversation, of, the, same, period, in, which, leigh, stunned, us, all, with, the, assertion, that, olivier, won, t, play, rhett, butler, but, i, shall, play, scarlett, o, hara, wait, and, see, despite, her, relative, inexperience, leigh, was, chosen, to, play, ophelia, to, olivier, s, hamlet, in, an, old, vic, theatre, production, staged, at, elsinore, denmark, olivier, later, recalled, an, incident, when, her, mood, rapidly, changed, as, she, was, preparing, to, go, onstage, without, apparent, provocation, she, began, screaming, at, him, before, suddenly, becoming, silent, and, staring, into, space, she, was, able, to, perform, without, mishap, and, by, the, following, day, she, had, returned, to, normal, with, no, recollection, of, the, event, it, was, the, first, time, olivier, witnessed, such, behaviour, from, her, they, began, living, together, as, their, respective, spouses, had, each, refused, to, grant, either, of, them, a, divorce, under, the, moral, standards, then, enforced, by, the, film, industry, their, relationship, had, to, be, kept,

in, the, united, states, during, production, she, developed, a, reputation, for, being, difficult, and, unreasonable, partly, because, she, disliked, her, secondary, role, but, mainly, because, her, petulant, antics, seemed, to, be, paying, dividends, after, dealing, with, the, threat, of, a, lawsuit, brought, over, a, frivolous, incident, korda, instructed, her, agent, to, warn, her, that, her, option, would, not, be, renewed, if, her, behaviour, did, not, improve, her, next, role, was, in, sidewalks, of, london, also, known, as, st, martin, s, lane, 1938, with, charles, laughton, olivier,

considered, to, play, the, part, of, scarlett, o, hara, david, o, selznick, watched, her, performances, that, month, in, fire, over, england, and, a, yank, at, oxford, and, thought, that, she, was, excellent, but, in, no, way, a, possible, scarlett, because, she, was, too, british, leigh, travelled, to, los, angeles, however, to, be, with, olivier, and, to, try, to, convince, david, selznick, that, she, was, the, right, person, for, the, part, myron, selznick, also, represented, olivier, and, when, he, met, leigh, he, felt, that, she, possessed, the, qualities, that, his, brother, was,

depression, that, hit, its, low, point, with, her, falling, to, the, floor, sobbing, in, an, hysterical, fit, this, was, the, first, of, many, major, bipolar, disorder, breakdowns, olivier, later, came, to, recognise, the, symptoms, of, an, impending, episode, several, days, of, hyperactivity, followed, by, a, period, of, depression, and, an, explosive, breakdown, after, which, leigh, would, have, no, memory, of, the, event, but, would, be, acutely, embarrassed, and, remorseful, with, her, doctor, s, approval, leigh, was, well, enough, to, resume, acting, in, 1946, starring, in, a, successful, london, production, of, thornton, wilder, s, the, skin, of, our, teeth, but, her, films, of, this, period, caesar, and, cleopatra, 1945, and, anna, karenina, 1948, were, not, great, commercial, successes, all, british, films, in, this, period, were, adversely, affected, by, a, hollywood, boycott, of, british, films, in, 1947, olivier, was, knighted, and, leigh, accompanied, him, to, buckingham, palace, for, the, investiture, she, became, lady, olivier, after, their, divorce, according, to, the, style, granted, to, the, divorced, wife, of, a, knight, she, became, known,

new, zealand, to, raise, funds, for, the, theatre, olivier, played, the, lead, in, richard, iii, and, also, performed, with, leigh, in, the, school, for, scandal, and, the, skin, of, our, teeth, the, tour, was, an, outstanding, success, and, although, leigh, was, plagued, with, insomnia, and, allowed, her, understudy, to, replace, her, for, a, week, while, she, was, ill, she, generally, withstood, the, demands, placed, upon, her, with, olivier, noting, her, ability, to, charm, the, press, members, of, the, company, later, recalled, several, quarrels, between, the, couple, as, olivier, was, increasingly, resentful, of, the, demands, placed, on, him, during, the, tour, the, most, dramatic, altercation, occurred, in, christchurch, new, zealand, when, her, shoes, were, not, found, and, leigh, refused, to, go, onstage, without, them, olivier, screamed, an, obscenity, at, her, and, slapped, her, face, and, a, devastated, leigh, slapped, him, in, return, dismayed, that, he, would, hit, her, publicly, subsequently, she, made, her, way, to, the, stage, in, borrowed, pumps, and, in, seconds, had, dried, her, tears, and, smiled, brightly, onstage, by, the, end, of, the, tour, both, were, exhausted, and, ill, olivier, told, a, journalist, you, may, not, know, it, but, you, are, talking, to, a, couple, of, walking, corpses, later, he, would, observe, that, he, lost, vivien, in, australia, the, success, of, the, tour, encouraged, the, oliviers, to, make, their, first, west, end, appearance, together, performing, the, same, works, with, one, addition, antigone, included, at, leigh, s, insistence, because, she, wished, to, play, a, role, in, a, tragedy, leigh, next, sought, the, role, of, blanche, dubois, in, the, west, end, stage, production, of, tennessee, williams, s, a, streetcar, named, desire, and, was, cast, after, williams, and, the, play, s, producer, irene, mayer, selznick, saw, her, in, the, school, for, scandal, and, antigone, olivier, was, contracted, to, direct, the, play, contained, a, rape, scene, and, references, to, promiscuity, and, homosexuality, and, was, destined, to, be, controversial, the, media, discussion, about, its, suitability, added, to, leigh, s, anxiety, nevertheless, she, believed, strongly, in, the, importance, of, the, work, when, the, west, end, production, of, streetcar, opened, in, october, 1949, j, b, priestley, denounced, the, play, and, leigh, s, performance, and, the, critic, kenneth, tynan, who, was, to, make, a, habit, of, dismissing, her, stage, performances, commented, that, leigh, was, badly, miscast, because, british, actors, were, too, well, bred, to, emote, effectively, on, stage, olivier, and, leigh, were, chagrined, that, part, of, the, commercial, success, of, the, play, lay, in, audience, members, attending, to, see, what, they, believed, would, be, a, salacious, story, rather, than, the, greek, tragedy, that, they, envisioned, the, play, also, had, strong, supporters, among, them, no, l, coward, who, described, leigh, as, magnificent, after, 326, performances, leigh, finished, her, run, and, she, was, soon, assigned, to, reprise, her, role, as, blanche, dubois, in, the, film, version, of, the, play, her, irreverent, and, often, bawdy, sense, of, humour, allowed, her, to, establish, a, rapport, with, marlon, brando, but, she, had, an, initial, difficulty, in, working, with, director, elia, kazan, who, was, displeased, with, the, direction, that, olivier, had, taken, in, shaping, the, character, of, blanche, kazan, had, favoured, jessica, tandy, and, later, olivia, de, havilland, over, leigh, but, knew, she, had, been, a, success, on, the, london, stage, as, blanche, he, later, commented, that, he, did, not, hold, her, in, high, regard, as, an, actress, believing,

and, much, that, i, had, never, dreamed, of, leigh, herself, had, mixed, feelings, about, her, association, with, the, character, in, later, years, she, said, that, playing, blanche, dubois, tipped, me, over, into, madness, in, 1951, in, london, leigh, and, laurence, olivier, performed, two, plays, about, cleopatra, william, shakespeare, s, antony, and, cleopatra, and, george, bernard, shaw, s,

into, 1952, the, reviews, there, were, also, mostly, positive, but, film, critic, kenneth, tynan, angered, them, when, he, suggested, that, leigh, s, was, a, mediocre, talent, that, forced, olivier, to, compromise, his, own, tynan, s, diatribe, almost, precipitated, another, collapse, leigh, terrified, of, failure, and, intent, on, achieving, greatness, dwelt, on, his, comments, and, ignored, the, positive, reviews, of, other, critics, in, january, 1953, leigh, travelled, to, ceylon, to, film, elephant, walk, with, peter, finch, shortly, after, filming, commenced, she, had, a, nervous, breakdown, and, paramount, pictures, replaced, her, with, elizabeth, taylor, olivier, returned, her, to, their, home, in, britain, where, between, periods, of, incoherence, leigh, told, him, she, was, in, love, with, finch, and, had, been, having, an, affair, with, him, over, a, period, of, several, months, she, gradually, recovered, as, a, result, of, this, episode, many, of, the, oliviers, friends, learned, of, her, problems, david, niven, said, she, had, been, quite, quite, mad, no, l, coward, expressed, surprise, in, his, diary, that, things, had, been, bad, and, getting, worse, since, 1948, or, thereabouts, leigh, s, romantic, relationship, with, finch, began, in, 1948, and, waxed, and, waned, for, several, years, ultimately, flickering, out, as, her, mental, condition, deteriorated, also, in, 1953, leigh, recovered, sufficiently, to, play, the, sleeping, prince, with, olivier, and, in, 1955, they, performed, a, season, at, stratford, upon, avon, in, shakespeare, s, twelfth, night, macbeth, and, titus, andronicus, they, played, to, capacity, houses, and, attracted, generally, good, reviews, leigh, s, health, seemingly, stable, john, gielgud, directed, twelfth, night, and, wrote, perhaps, i, will, still, make, a, good, thing, of, that, divine, play, especially, if, he, will, let, me, pull, her, little, ladyship, who, is, brainier, than, he, but, not, a, born, actress, out, of, her, timidity, and, safeness, he, dares, too, confidently, but, she, hardly, dares, at, all, and, is, terrified, of, overreaching, her, technique, and, doing, anything, that, she, has, not, killed, the, spontaneity, of, by, overpractice, in, 1955, leigh, starred, in, anatole, litvak, s, film, the, deep, blue, sea, co, star, kenneth, more, felt, he, had, poor, chemistry, with, leigh, during, the, filming, in, 1956, leigh, took, the, lead, role, in, the, no, l, coward, play, south, sea, bubble, but, withdrew, from, the, production, when, she, became, pregnant, several, weeks, later, she, miscarried, and, entered, a, period, of, depression, that, lasted, for, months, she, joined, olivier, for, a, european, tour, of, titus, andronicus, but, the, tour, was, marred, by, leigh, s, frequent, outbursts, against, olivier, and, other, members, of, the, company, after, their, return, to, london, her, former, husband, leigh, holman, who, could, still, exert, a, strong, influence, on, her, stayed, with, the, oliviers, and, helped, calm, her, in, 1959, when, she, achieved, a, success, with, the, no, l, coward, comedy, look, after, lulu, a, critic, working, for, the, times, described, her, as, beautiful, delectably, cool, and, matter, of, fact, she, is, mistress, of, every, situation, considering, her, marriage, to, be, over, leigh, began, a, relationship, with, actor, john, merivale, in, 1960, who, knew, of, leigh, s, medical, condition, and, assured, olivier, that, he, would, care, for, her, that, same, year, she, and, olivier, divorced, and, olivier, soon, married, actress, joan, plowright, in, his, autobiography, olivier, discussed, the, years, of, strain, they, had, experienced, because, of, leigh, s, illness, throughout, her, possession, by, that, uncannily, evil, monster, manic, depression, with, its, deadly, ever, tightening, spirals, she, retained, her, own, individual, canniness, an, ability, to, disguise, her, true, mental, condition, from, almost, all, except, me, for, whom, she, could, hardly, be, expected, to, take, the, trouble, merivale, proved, to, be, a, stabilising, influence, for, leigh, but, despite, her, apparent, contentment, she, was, quoted, by, radie, harris, as, confiding, that, she, would, rather, have, lived, a, short, life, with, larry, than, face, a, long, one, without, him, her, first, husband, leigh, holman, also, spent, considerable, time, with, her, merivale, joined, her, for, a, tour, of, australia, new, zealand, and, latin, america, that, lasted, from, july, 1961, until, may, 1962, and, leigh, enjoyed, positive, reviews, without, sharing, the, spotlight, with, olivier, though, she, was, still, beset, by, bouts, of, depression, she, continued, to, work, in, the, theatre, and, in, 1963, won, a, tony, award, for, best, actress, in, a, musical, for, her, role, in, tovarich, she, also, appeared, in, the, films, the, roman, spring, of, mrs, stone, 1961, and, ship, of, fools, 1965, leigh, s, last, screen, appearance, in, ship, of, fools, was, both, a, triumph, and, emblematic, of, her, illnesses, that, were, taking, root, producer, and, director, stanley, kramer, who, ended, up, with, the, film, planned, to, star, leigh, but, was, initially, unaware, of, her, fragile, mental, and, physical, state, later, recounting, her, work, kramer, remembered, her, courage, in, taking, on, the, difficult, role, she, was, ill, and, the, courage, to, go, ahead, the, courage, to, make, the, film, was, almost, unbelievable, leigh, s, performance, was, tinged, by, paranoia, and, resulted, in, outbursts, that, marred, her, relationship, with, other, actors, although, both, simone, signoret, and, lee, marvin, were, sympathetic, and, understanding, in, one, unusual, instance, during, the, attempted, rape, scene, leigh, became, distraught, and, hit, marvin, so, hard, with, a, spiked, shoe, that, it, marked, his, face, leigh, won, the, l, toile, de, cristal, for, her, performance, in, a, leading, role, in, ship, of, fools, in, may, 1967, leigh, was, rehearsing, to, appear, with, michael, redgrave, in, edward, albee, s, a, delicate, balance, when, her, tuberculosis, resurfaced, following, several, weeks, of, rest, she, seemed, to, recover, on, the, night, of, 7, july, 1967, merivale, left, her, as, usual, at, their, eaton, square, flat, to, perform, in, a, play, and, he, returned, home, just, before, midnight, to, find, her, asleep, about, 30, minutes, later, by, now, 8, july, he, entered, the, bedroom, and, discovered, her, body, on, the, floor, she, had, been, attempting, to, walk, to, the, bathroom, and, as, her, lungs, filled, with, liquid, she, collapsed, and, suffocated, merivale, first, contacted, her, family, and, later, was, able, to, reach, olivier, who, was, receiving, treatment, for, prostate, cancer, in, a, nearby, hospital, in, his, autobiography, olivier, described, his, grievous, anguish, as, he, immediately, travelled, to, leigh, s, residence, to, find, that, merivale, had, moved, her, body, onto, the, bed, olivier, paid, his, respects, and, stood, and, prayed, for, forgiveness, for, all, the, evils, that, had, sprung, up, between, us, before, helping, merivale, make, funeral, arrangements, olivier, stayed, until, her, body, was, removed, from, the, flat, her, death, was, publicly, announced, on, 8, july, and, the,

ceremony, was, conducted, as, a, memorial, service, with, selections, from, her, films, shown, and, tributes, provided, by, such, associates, as, george, cukor, who, screened, the, tests, that, leigh, had, made, for, gone, with, the, wind, the, first, time, the, screen, tests, had, been, seen, in, 30, years, leigh, was, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, beautiful, actresses, of, her, day, and, her, directors, emphasised, this, in, most, of, her, films, when, asked, if, she, believed, her, beauty, had, been, an, impediment, to, being, taken, seriously, as, an, actress, she, said, people, think, that, if, you, look, fairly, reasonable, you, can, t, possibly, act, and, as, i, only, care, about, acting, i, think, beauty, can, be, a, great, handicap, if, you, really, want, to, look, like, the, part, you, re, playing, which, isn, t, necessarily, like, you, director, george, cukor, described, leigh, as, a, consummate, actress, hampered, by, beauty, and, laurence, olivier, said, that, critics, should, give, her, credit, for, being, an, actress, and, not, go, on, forever, letting, their, judgments, be, distorted, by, her, great, beauty, garson, kanin, shared, their, viewpoint, and, described, leigh, as, a, stunner, whose, ravishing, beauty, often, tended, to, obscure, her, staggering, achievements, as, an, actress, great, beauties, are, infrequently, great, actresses, simply, because, they, don, t, need, to, be, vivien, was, different, ambitious, persevering, serious, often, inspired, leigh, explained, that, she, played, as, many, different, parts, as, possible, in, an, attempt, to, learn, her, craft, and, to, dispel, prejudice, about, her, abilities, she, believed, that, comedy, was, more, difficult, to, play, than, drama, because, it, required, more, precise, timing, and, said, that, more, emphasis, should, be, placed, upon, comedy, as, part, of, an, actor, s, training, nearing, the, end, of, her, career, which, ranged, from, no, l, coward, comedies, to, shakespearean, tragedies, she, observed, it, s, much, easier, to, make, people, cry, than, to, make, them, laugh, her, early, performances, brought, her, immediate, success, in, britain, but, she, remained, largely, unknown, in, other, parts, of, the, world, until, the, release, of, gone, with, the, wind, in, december, 1939, film, critic, frank, nugent, wrote, in, the, new, york, times, miss, leigh, s, scarlett, has, vindicated, the, absurd, talent, quest, that, indirectly, turned, her, up, she, is, so, perfectly, designed, for, the, part, by, art, and, nature, that, any, other, actress, in, the, role, would, be, inconceivable, and, as, her, fame, escalated, she, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, time, magazine, as, scarlett, in, 1969, critic, andrew, sarris, commented, that, the, success, of, the, film, had, been, largely, due, to, the, inspired, casting, of, leigh, and, in, 1998, wrote, that, she, lives, in, our, minds, and, memories, as, a, dynamic, force, rather, than, as, a, static, presence, film, historian, and, critic, leonard, maltin, described, the, film, as, one, of, the, all, time, greats, writing, in, 1998, that, leigh, brilliantly, played, her, role, her, performance, in, the, west, end, production, of, a, streetcar, named, desire, described, by, the, theatre, writer, phyllis, hartnoll, as, proof, of, greater, powers, as, an, actress, than, she, had, hitherto, shown, led, to, a, lengthy, period, during, which, she, was, considered, one, of, the, finest, actresses, in, british, theatre, discussing, the, subsequent, film, version, pauline, kael, wrote, that, leigh, and, marlon, brando, gave, two, of, the, greatest, performances, ever, put, on, film, and, that, leigh, s, was, one, of, those, rare, performances, that, can, truly, be, said, to, evoke, both, fear, and, pity, her, greatest, critic, was, kenneth, tynan, who, ridiculed, leigh, s, performance, opposite, olivier, in, the, 1955, production, of, titus, andronicus, commenting, that, she, receives, the, news, that, she, is, about, to, be, ravished, on, her, husband, s, corpse, with, little, more, than, the, mild, annoyance, of, one, who, would, have, preferred, foam, rubber, he, was, also, critical, of, her, reinterpretation, of, lady, macbeth, in, 1955, saying, that, her, performance, was, insubstantial, and, lacked, the, necessary, fury, demanded, of, the, role, after, her, death, however, tynan, revised, his, opinion, describing, his, earlier, criticism, as, one, of, the, worst, errors, of, judgment, he, had, ever, made, he, came, to, believe, that, leigh, s, interpretation, in, which, lady, macbeth, uses, her, sexual, allure, to, keep, macbeth, enthralled, made, more, sense, than, the, usual, battle, axe, portrayal, of, the, character, in, a, survey, of, theatre, critics, conducted, shortly, after, leigh, s, death, several, named, her, performance, as, lady, macbeth, as, one, of, her, greatest, achievements, in, theatre, in, 1969, a, plaque, to, leigh, was, placed, in, the, actors, church, st, paul, s, covent, garden, london, in, 1985, a, portrait, of, her, was, included, in, a, series, of, united, kingdom, postage,
