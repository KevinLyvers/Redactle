kurt, friedrich, g, del, r, d, l, gur, d, l, german, april, 28, 1906, january, 14, 1978, was, a, logician, mathematician, and, philosopher, considered, along, with, aristotle, and, gottlob, frege, to, be, one, of, the, most, significant, logicians, in, history, g, del, profoundly, influenced, scientific, and, philosophical, thinking, in, the, 20th, century, at, a, time, when, bertrand, russell, alfred, north, whitehead, and, david, hilbert, were, using, logic, and, set, theory, to, investigate, the, foundations, of, mathematics, building, on, earlier, work, by, frege, richard, dedekind, and, georg, cantor, g, del, s, discoveries, in, the, foundations, of, mathematics, led, to, the, proof, of, his, completeness, theorem, in, 1929, as, part, of, his, dissertation, to, earn, a, doctorate, at, the, university, of, vienna, and, the, publication, of, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, two, years, later, in, 1931, the, first, incompleteness, theorem, states, that, for, any, consistent, recursive, axiomatic, system, powerful, enough, to, describe, the, arithmetic, of, the, natural, numbers, for, example, peano, arithmetic, there, are, true, propositions, about, the, natural, numbers, that, can, be, neither, proved, nor, disproved, from, the, axioms, to, prove, this, g, del, developed, a, technique, now, known, as, g, del, numbering, which, codes, formal, expressions, as, natural, numbers, the, second, incompleteness, theorem, which, follows, from, the, first, states, that, the, system, cannot, prove, its, own, consistency, g, del, also, showed, that, neither, the, axiom, of, choice, nor, the, continuum, hypothesis, can, be, disproved, from, the, accepted, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, assuming, that, its, axioms, are, consistent, the, former, result, opened, the, door, for, mathematicians, to, assume, the, axiom, of, choice, in, their, proofs, he, also, made, important, contributions, to, proof, theory, by, clarifying, the, connections, between, classical, logic, intuitionistic, logic, and, modal, logic, g, del, was, born, april, 28, 1906, in, br, nn, austria, hungary, now, brno, czech, republic, into, the, german, speaking, family, of, rudolf, g, del, 1874, 1929, the, managing, director, and, part, owner, of, a, major, textile, firm, and, marianne, g, del, n, e, handschuh, 1879, 1966, at, the, time, of, his, birth, the, city, had, a, german, speaking, majority, which, included, his, parents, his, father, was, catholic, and, his, mother, was, protestant, and, the, children, were, raised, as, protestants, the, ancestors, of, kurt, g, del, were, often, active, in, br, nn, s, cultural, life, for, example, his, grandfather, joseph, g, del, was, a, famous, singer, in, his, time, and, for, some, years, a, member, of, the, br, nner, m, nnergesangverein, men, s, choral, union, of, br, nn, g, del, automatically, became, a, citizen, of, czechoslovakia, at, age, 12, when, the, austro, hungarian, empire, collapsed, following, its, defeat, in, the, first, world, war, according, to, his, classmate, klepeta, like, many, residents, of, the, predominantly, german, sudetenl, nder, g, del, considered, himself, always, austrian, and, an, exile, in, czechoslovakia, in, february, 1929, he, was, granted, release, from, his, czechoslovak, citizenship, and, then, in, april, granted, austrian, citizenship, when, germany, annexed, austria, in, 1938, g, del, automatically, became, a, german, citizen, at, age, 32, in, 1948, after, world, war, ii, at, the, age, of, 42, he, became, an, american, citizen, in, his, family, the, young, g, del, was, nicknamed, herr, warum, mr, why, because, of, his, insatiable, curiosity, according, to, his, brother, rudolf, at, the, age, of, six, or, seven, kurt, suffered, from, rheumatic, fever, he, completely, recovered, but, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, remained, convinced, that, his, heart, had, suffered, permanent, damage, beginning, at, age, four, g, del, suffered, from, frequent, episodes, of, poor, health, which, would, continue, for, his, entire, life, g, del, attended, the, evangelische, volksschule, a, lutheran, school, in, br, nn, from, 1912, to, 1916, and, was, enrolled, in, the, deutsches, staats, realgymnasium, from, 1916, to, 1924, excelling, with, honors, in, all, his, subjects, particularly, in, mathematics, languages, and, religion, although, g, del, had, first, excelled, in, languages, he, later, became, more, interested, in, history, and, mathematics, his, interest, in, mathematics, increased, when, in, 1920, his, older, brother, rudolf, born, 1902, left, for, vienna, where, he, attended, medical, school, at, the, university, of, vienna, during, his, teens, g, del, studied, gabelsberger, shorthand, and, criticisms, of, isaac, newton, and, the, writings, of, immanuel, kant, at, the, age, of, 18, g, del, joined, his, brother, at, the, university, of, vienna, he, had, already, mastered, university, level, mathematics, although, initially, intending, to, study, theoretical, physics, he, also, attended, courses, on, mathematics, and, philosophy, during, this, time, he, adopted, ideas, of, mathematical, realism, he, read, kant, s, metaphysische, anfangsgr, nde, der, naturwissenschaft, and, participated, in, the, vienna, circle, with, moritz, schlick, hans, hahn, and, rudolf, carnap, g, del, then, studied, number, theory, but, when, he, took, part, in, a, seminar, run, by, moritz, schlick, which, studied, bertrand, russell, s, book, introduction, to, mathematical, philosophy, he, became, interested, in, mathematical, logic, according, to, g, del, mathematical, logic, was, a, science, prior, to, all, others, which, contains, the, ideas, and, principles, underlying, all, sciences, attending, a, lecture, by, david, hilbert, in, bologna, on, completeness, and, consistency, in, mathematical, systems, may, have, set, g, del, s, life, course, in, 1928, hilbert, and, wilhelm, ackermann, published, grundz, ge, der, theoretischen, logik, principles, of, mathematical, logic, an, introduction, to, first, order, logic, in, which, the, problem, of, completeness, was, posed, are, the, axioms, of, a, formal, system, sufficient, to, derive, every, statement, that, is, true, in, all, models, of, the, system, this, problem, became, the, topic, that, g, del, chose, for, his, doctoral, work, in, 1929, aged, 23, he, completed, his, doctoral, dissertation, under, hans, hahn, s, supervision, in, it, he, established, his, eponymous, completeness, theorem, regarding, first, order, logic, he, was, awarded, his, doctorate, in, 1930, and, his, thesis, accompanied, by, additional, work, was, published, by, the, vienna, academy, of, science, kurt, g, del, s, achievement, in, modern, logic, is, singular, and, monumental, indeed, it, is, more, than, a, monument, it, is, a, landmark, which, will, remain, visible, far, in, space, and, time, the, subject, of, logic, has, certainly, completely, changed, its, nature, and, possibilities, with, g, del, s, achievement, in, 1930, g, del, attended, the, second, conference, on, the, epistemology, of, the, exact, sciences, held, in, k, nigsberg, 5, 7, september, here, he, delivered, his, incompleteness, theorems, g, del, published, his, incompleteness, theorems, in, ber, formal, unentscheidbare, s, tze, der, principia, mathematica, und, verwandter, systeme, called, in, english, on, formally, undecidable, propositions, of, principia, mathematica, and, related, systems, in, that, article, he, proved, for, any, computable, axiomatic, system, that, is, powerful, enough, to, describe, the, arithmetic, of, the, natural, numbers, e, g, the, peano, axioms, or, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, with, the, axiom, of, choice, that, these, theorems, ended, a, half, century, of, attempts, beginning, with, the, work, of, gottlob, frege, and, culminating, in, principia, mathematica, and, hilbert, s, program, to, find, a, non, relatively, consistent, axiomatization, sufficient, for, number, theory, that, was, to, serve, as, the, foundation, for, other, fields, of, mathematics, g, del, constructed, a, formula, that, claims, it, is, unprovable, in, a, given, formal, system, if, it, were, provable, it, would, be, false, thus, there, will, always, be, at, least, one, true, but, unprovable, statement, that, is, for, any, computably, enumerable, set, of, axioms, for, arithmetic, that, is, a, set, that, can, in, principle, be, printed, out, by, an, idealized, computer, with, unlimited, resources, there, is, a, formula, that, is, true, of, arithmetic, but, not, provable, in, that, system, to, make, this, precise, g, del, had, to, produce, a, method, to, encode, as, natural, numbers, statements, proofs, and, the, concept, of, provability, he, did, this, by, a, process, known, as, g, del, numbering, in, his, two, page, paper, zum, intuitionistischen, aussagenkalk, l, 1932, g, del, refuted, the, finite, valuedness, of, intuitionistic, logic, in, the, proof, he, implicitly, used, what, has, later, become, known, as, g, del, dummett, intermediate, logic, or, g, del, fuzzy, logic, g, del, earned, his, habilitation, at, vienna, in, 1932, and, in, 1933, he, became, a, privatdozent, unpaid, lecturer, there, in, 1933, adolf, hitler, came, to, power, in, germany, and, over, the, following, years, the, nazis, rose, in, influence, in, austria, and, among, vienna, s, mathematicians, in, june, 1936, moritz, schlick, whose, seminar, had, aroused, g, del, s, interest, in, logic, was, assassinated, by, one, of, his, former, students, johann, nelb, ck, this, triggered, a, severe, nervous, crisis, in, g, del, he, developed, paranoid, symptoms, including, a, fear, of, being, poisoned, and, spent, several, months, in, a, sanitarium, for, nervous, diseases, in, 1933, g, del, first, traveled, to, the, u, s, where, he, met, albert, einstein, who, became, a, good, friend, he, delivered, an, address, to, the, annual, meeting, of, the, american, mathematical, society, during, this, year, g, del, also, developed, the, ideas, of, computability, and, recursive, functions, to, the, point, where, he, was, able, to, present, a, lecture, on, general, recursive, functions, and, the, concept, of, truth, this, work, was, developed, in, number, theory, using, g, del, numbering, in, 1934, g, del, gave, a, series, of, lectures, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, ias, in, princeton, new, jersey, titled, on, undecidable, propositions, of, formal, mathematical, systems, stephen, kleene, who, had, just, completed, his, phd, at, princeton, took, notes, of, these, lectures, that, have, been, subsequently, published, g, del, visited, the, ias, again, in, the, autumn, of, 1935, the, travelling, and, the, hard, work, had, exhausted, him, and, the, next, year, he, took, a, break, to, recover, from, a, depressive, episode, he, returned, to, teaching, in, 1937, during, this, time, he, worked, on, the, proof, of, consistency, of, the, axiom, of, choice, and, of, the, continuum, hypothesis, he, went, on, to, show, that, these, hypotheses, cannot, be, disproved, from, the, common, system, of, axioms, of, set, theory, he, married, adele, nimbursky, n, e, porkert, 1899, 1981, whom, he, had, known, for, over, 10, years, on, september, 20, 1938, g, del, s, parents, had, opposed, their, relationship, because, she, was, a, divorced, dancer, six, years, older, than, he, was, subsequently, he, left, for, another, visit, to, the, united, states, spending, the, autumn, of, 1938, at, the, ias, and, publishing, consistency, of, the, axiom, of, choice, and, of, the, generalized, continuum, hypothesis, with, the, axioms, of, set, theory, a, classic, of, modern, mathematics, in, that, work, he, introduced, the, constructible, universe, a, model, of, set, theory, in, which, the, only, sets, that, exist, are, those, that, can, be, constructed, from, simpler, sets, g, del, showed, that, both, the, axiom, of, choice, ac, and, the, generalized, continuum, hypothesis, gch, are, true, in, the, constructible, universe, and, therefore, must, be, consistent, with, the, zermelo, fraenkel, axioms, for, set, theory, zf, this, result, has, had, considerable, consequences, for, working, mathematicians, as, it, means, they, can, assume, the, axiom, of, choice, when, proving, the, hahn, banach, theorem, paul, cohen, later, constructed, a, model, of, zf, in, which, ac, and, gch, are, false, together, these, proofs, mean, that, ac, and, gch, are, independent, of, the, zf, axioms, for, set, theory, g, del, spent, the, spring, of, 1939, at, the, university, of, notre, dame, after, the, anschluss, on, 12, march, 1938, austria, had, become, a, part, of, nazi, germany, germany, abolished, the, title, privatdozent, so, g, del, had, to, apply, for, a, different, position, under, the, new, order, his, former, association, with, jewish, members, of, the, vienna, circle, especially, with, hahn, weighed, against, him, the, university, of, vienna, turned, his, application, down, his, predicament, intensified, when, the, german, army, found, him, fit, for, conscription, world, war, ii, started, in, september, 1939, before, the, year, was, up, g, del, and, his, wife, left, vienna, for, princeton, to, avoid, the, difficulty, of, an, atlantic, crossing, the, g, dels, took, the, trans, siberian, railway, to, the, pacific, sailed, from, japan, to, san, francisco, which, they, reached, on, march, 4, 1940, then, crossed, the, us, by, train, to, princeton, during, this, trip, g, del, was, supposed, to, be, carrying, a, secret, letter, from, viennese, physicist, hans, thirring, to, albert, einstein, to, alert, roosevelt, of, the, possibility, of, hitler, making, an, atom, bomb, g, del, never, conveyed, that, letter, to, einstein, although, they, did, meet, because, he, was, not, convinced, hitler, could, achieve, this, feat, in, any, case, leo, szilard, had, already, conveyed, the, message, to, einstein, and, einstein, had, already, warned, roosevelt, in, princeton, g, del, accepted, a, position, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, ias, which, he, had, visited, during, 1933, 34, einstein, was, also, living, in, princeton, during, this, time, g, del, and, einstein, developed, a, strong, friendship, and, were, known, to, take, long, walks, together, to, and, from, the, institute, for, advanced, study, the, nature, of, their, conversations, was, a, mystery, to, the, other, institute, members, economist, oskar, morgenstern, recounts, that, toward, the, end, of, his, life, einstein, confided, that, his, own, work, no, longer, meant, much, that, he, came, to, the, institute, merely, to, have, the, privilege, of, walking, home, with, g, del, g, del, and, his, wife, adele, spent, the, summer, of, 1942, in, blue, hill, maine, at, the, blue, hill, inn, at, the, top, of, the, bay, g, del, was, not, merely, vacationing, but, had, a, very, productive, summer, of, work, using, heft, 15, of, g, del, s, still, unpublished, arbeitshefte, john, w, dawson, jr, conjectures, that, g, del, discovered, a, proof, for, the, independence, of, the, axiom, of, choice, from, finite, type, theory, a, weakened, form, of, set, theory, while, in, blue, hill, in, 1942, g, del, s, close, friend, hao, wang, supports, this, conjecture, noting, that, g, del, s, blue, hill, notebooks, contain, his, most, extensive, treatment, of, the, problem, on, december, 5, 1947, einstein, and, morgenstern, accompanied, g, del, to, his, u, s, citizenship, exam, where, they, acted, as, witnesses, g, del, had, confided, in, them, that, he, had, discovered, an, inconsistency, in, the, u, s, constitution, that, could, allow, the, u, s, to, become, a, dictatorship, this, has, since, been, dubbed, g, del, s, loophole, einstein, and, morgenstern, were, concerned, that, their, friend, s, unpredictable, behavior, might, jeopardize, his, application, the, judge, turned, out, to, be, phillip, forman, who, knew, einstein, and, had, administered, the, oath, at, einstein, s, own, citizenship, hearing, everything, went, smoothly, until, forman, happened, to, ask, g, del, if, he, thought, a, dictatorship, like, the, nazi, regime, could, happen, in, the, u, s, g, del, then, started, to, explain, his, discovery, to, forman, forman, understood, what, was, going, on, cut, g, del, off, and, moved, the, hearing, on, to, other, questions, and, a, routine, conclusion, g, del, became, a, permanent, member, of, the, institute, for, advanced, study, at, princeton, in, 1946, around, this, time, he, stopped, publishing, though, he, continued, to, work, he, became, a, full, professor, at, the, institute, in, 1953, and, an, emeritus, professor, in, 1976, during, his, time, at, the, institute, g, del, s, interests, turned, to, philosophy, and, physics, in, 1949, he, demonstrated, the, existence, of, solutions, involving, closed, timelike, curves, to, einstein, s, field, equations, in, general, relativity, he, is, said, to, have, given, this, elaboration, to, einstein, as, a, present, for, his, 70th, birthday, his, rotating, universes, would, allow, time, travel, to, the, past, and, caused, einstein, to, have, doubts, about, his, own, theory, his, solutions, are, known, as, the, g, del, metric, an, exact, solution, of, the, einstein, field, equation, he, studied, and, admired, the, works, of, gottfried, leibniz, but, came, to, believe, that, a, hostile, conspiracy, had, caused, some, of, leibniz, s, works, to, be, suppressed, to, a, lesser, extent, he, studied, immanuel, kant, and, edmund, husserl, in, the, early, 1970s, g, del, circulated, among, his, friends, an, elaboration, of, leibniz, s, version, of, anselm, of, canterbury, s, ontological, proof, of, god, s, existence, this, is, now, known, as, g, del, s, ontological, proof, g, del, was, awarded, with, julian, schwinger, the, first, albert, einstein, award, in, 1951, and, was, also, awarded, the, national, medal, of, science, in, 1974, g, del, was, elected, a, resident, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1961, and, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1968, he, was, a, plenary, speaker, of, the, icm, in, 1950, in, cambridge, massachusetts, later, in, his, life, g, del, suffered, periods, of, mental, instability, and, illness, following, the, assassination, of, his, close, friend, moritz, schlick, g, del, developed, an, obsessive, fear, of, being, poisoned, and, would, eat, only, food, prepared, by, his, wife, adele, adele, was, hospitalized, beginning, in, late, 1977, and, in, her, absence, g, del, refused, to, eat, he, weighed, 29, kilograms, 65, lb, when, he, died, of, malnutrition, and, inanition, caused, by, personality, disturbance, in, princeton, hospital, on, january, 14, 1978, he, was, buried, in, princeton, cemetery, adele, died, in, 1981, g, del, believed, that, god, was, personal, and, called, his, philosophy, rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and, theological, he, formulated, a, formal, proof, for, the, existence, of, god, known, as, g, del, s, ontological, proof, g, del, believed, in, an, afterlife, saying, of, course, this, supposes, that, there, are, many, relationships, which, today, s, science, and, received, wisdom, haven, t, any, inkling, of, but, i, am, convinced, of, this, independently, of, any, theology, it, is, possible, today, to, perceive, by, pure, reasoning, that, it, is, entirely, consistent, with, known, facts, if, the, world, is, rationally, constructed, and, has, meaning, then, there, must, be, such, a, thing, in, an, unmailed, answer, to, a, questionnaire, g, del, described, his, religion, as, baptized, lutheran, but, not, member, of, any, religious, congregation, my, belief, is, theistic, not, pantheistic, following, leibniz, rather, than, spinoza, of, religion, s, in, general, he, said, religions, are, for, the, most, part, bad, but, not, religion, itself, according, to, his, wife, adele, g, del, although, he, did, not, go, to, church, was, religious, and, read, the, bible, in, bed, every, sunday, morning, while, of, islam, he, said, i, like, islam, it, is, a, consistent, idea, of, religion, and, open, minded, douglas, hofstadter, wrote, the, 1979, book, g, del, escher, bach, to, celebrate, the, work, and, ideas, of, g, del, m, c, escher, and, johann, sebastian, bach, it, partly, explores, the, ramifications, of, the, fact, that, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorem, can, be, applied, to, any, turing, complete, computational, system, which, may, include, the, human, brain, in, 2005, john, dawson, published, a, biography, logical, dilemmas, the, life, and, work, of, kurt, g, del, stephen, budiansky, s, book, about, g, del,
