herodotus, ancient, greek, romanized, h, r, dotos, c, 484, c, 425, bc, was, a, greek, historian, and, geographer, from, the, greek, city, of, halicarnassus, part, of, the, persian, empire, now, bodrum, turkey, and, a, later, citizen, of, thurii, in, modern, calabria, italy, he, is, known, for, having, written, the, histories, a, detailed, account, of, the, greco, persian, wars, herodotus, was, the, first, writer, to, perform, systematic, investigation, of, historical, events, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, history, a, title, conferred, on, him, by, the, ancient, roman, orator, cicero, the, histories, primarily, cover, the, lives, of, prominent, kings, and, famous, battles, such, as, marathon, thermopylae, artemisium, salamis, plataea, and, mycale, his, work, deviates, from, the, main, topics, to, provide, a, cultural, ethnographical, geographical, and, historiographical, background, that, forms, an, essential, part, of, the, narrative, and, provides, readers, with, a, wellspring, of, additional, information, herodotus, was, criticized, in, ancient, times, for, his, inclusion, of, legends, and, fanciful, accounts, in, his, work, the, contemporaneous, historian, thucydides, accused, him, of, making, up, stories, for, entertainment, however, herodotus, explained, that, he, reported, what, he, could, see, and, was, told, a, sizable, portion, of, the, histories, has, since, been, confirmed, by, modern, historians, and, archaeologists, modern, scholars, generally, turn, to, herodotus, s, own, writing, for, reliable, information, about, his, life, 7, supplemented, with, ancient, yet, much, later, sources, such, as, the, byzantine, suda, an, 11th, century, encyclopedia, which, possibly, took, its, information, from, traditional, accounts, still, the, challenge, is, great, the, data, are, so, few, they, rest, upon, such, late, and, slight, authority, they, are, so, improbable, or, so, contradictory, that, to, compile, them, into, a, biography, is, like, building, a, house, of, cards, which, the, first, breath, of, criticism, will, blow, to, the, ground, still, certain, points, may, be, approximately, fixed, herodotus, was, according, to, his, own, statement, at, the, beginning, of, his, work, a, native, of, halicarnassus, in, anatolia, and, it, is, generally, accepted, that, he, was, born, there, around, 485, bc, the, suda, says, his, family, was, influential, that, he, was, the, son, of, lyxes, and, dryo, and, the, brother, of, theodorus, and, that, he, was, also, related, to, panyassis, an, epic, poet, of, the, time, introduction, introduction, halicarnassus, was, then, within, the, persian, empire, making, herodotus, a, persian, subject, and, it, may, be, that, the, young, herodotus, heard, local, eyewitness, accounts, of, events, within, the, empire, and, of, persian, preparations, for, the, invasion, of, greece, including, the, movements, of, the, local, fleet, under, the, command, of, artemisia, i, of, caria, inscriptions, recently, discovered, at, halicarnassus, indicate, that, artemesia, s, grandson, lygdamis, negotiated, with, a, local, assembly, to, settle, disputes, over, seized, property, which, is, consistent, with, a, tyrant, under, pressure, his, name, is, not, mentioned, later, in, the, tribute, list, of, the, athenian, delian, league, indicating, that, there, might, well, have, been, a, successful, uprising, against, him, some, time, before, 454, bc, herodotus, wrote, his, histories, in, the, ionian, dialect, in, spite, of, being, born, in, a, dorian, settlement, according, to, the, suda, herodotus, learned, the, ionian, dialect, as, a, boy, living, on, the, island, of, samos, to, which, he, had, fled, with, his, family, from, the, oppressions, of, lygdamis, tyrant, of, halicarnassus, and, grandson, of, artemisia, panyassis, the, epic, poet, related, to, herodotus, is, reported, to, have, taken, part, in, a, failed, uprising, the, suda, also, states, that, herodotus, later, returned, home, to, lead, the, revolt, that, eventually, overthrew, the, tyrant, due, to, recent, discoveries, of, inscriptions, at, halicarnassus, dated, to, about, herodotus, time, it, is, now, known, that, the, ionic, dialect, was, used, in, halicarnassus, in, some, official, documents, so, there, is, no, need, to, assume, like, the, suda, that, he, must, have, learned, the, dialect, elsewhere, 11, the, suda, is, the, only, source, placing, herodotus, as, the, heroic, liberator, of, his, birthplace, casting, doubt, upon, the, veracity, of, that, romantic, account, 11, as, herodotus, himself, reveals, halicarnassus, though, a, dorian, city, had, ended, its, close, relations, with, its, dorian, neighbours, after, an, unseemly, quarrel, i, 144, and, it, had, helped, pioneer, greek, trade, with, egypt, ii, 178, it, was, therefore, an, outward, looking, international, minded, port, within, the, persian, empire, and, the, historian, s, family, could, well, have, had, contacts, in, other, countries, under, persian, rule, facilitating, his, travels, and, his, researches, herodotus, eyewitness, accounts, indicate, that, he, traveled, in, egypt, in, association, with, athenians, probably, sometime, after, 454, bc, or, possibly, earlier, after, an, athenian, fleet, had, assisted, the, uprising, against, persian, rule, in, 460, 454, bc, he, probably, traveled, to, tyre, next, and, then, down, the, euphrates, to, babylon, for, some, reason, possibly, associated, with, local, politics, he, subsequently, found, himself, unpopular, in, halicarnassus, and, sometime, around, 447, bc, migrated, to, periclean, athens, a, city, whose, people, and, democratic, institutions, he, openly, admired, v, 78, athens, was, also, the, place, where, he, came, to, know, the, local, topography, vi, 137, viii, 52, 55, as, well, as, leading, citizens, such, as, the, alcmaeonids, a, clan, whose, history, is, featured, frequently, in, his, writing, according, to, plutarch, herodotus, was, granted, a, financial, reward, by, the, athenian, assembly, in, recognition, of, his, work, plutarch, using, diyllus, as, a, source, says, this, was, 10, talents, in, 443, bc, or, shortly, afterwards, he, migrated, to, thurii, in, modern, calabria, as, part, of, an, athenian, sponsored, colony, aristotle, refers, to, a, version, of, the, histories, written, by, herodotus, of, thurium, and, some, passages, in, the, histories, have, been, interpreted, as, proof, that, he, wrote, about, magna, graecia, from, personal, experience, there, iv, 15, 99, vi, 127, according, to, ptolemaeus, chennus, a, late, source, summarized, in, the, library, of, photius, plesirrhous, the, thessalian, the, hymnographer, was, the, eromenos, of, herodotus, and, his, heir, this, account, has, also, led, some, historians, to, assume, herodotus, died, childless, intimate, knowledge, of, some, events, in, the, first, years, of, the, peloponnesian, war, vi, 91, vii, 133, 233, ix, 73, suggests, that, he, returned, to, athens, in, which, case, it, is, possible, that, he, died, there, during, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, it, is, also, possible, he, died, in, macedonia, instead, after, obtaining, the, patronage, of, the, court, there, or, else, he, died, back, in, thurii, there, is, nothing, in, the, histories, that, can, be, dated, to, later, than, 430, bc, with, any, certainty, and, it, is, generally, assumed, that, he, died, not, long, afterwards, possibly, before, his, sixtieth, year, herodotus, would, have, made, his, researches, known, to, the, larger, world, through, oral, recitations, to, a, public, crowd, john, marincola, writes, in, his, introduction, to, the, penguin, edition, of, the, histories, that, there, are, certain, identifiable, pieces, in, the, early, books, of, herodotus, work, which, could, be, labeled, as, performance, pieces, these, portions, of, the, research, seem, independent, and, almost, detachable, so, that, they, might, have, been, set, aside, by, the, author, for, the, purposes, of, an, oral, performance, the, intellectual, matrix, of, the, 5th, century, marincola, suggests, comprised, many, oral, performances, in, which, philosophers, would, dramatically, recite, such, detachable, pieces, of, their, work, the, idea, was, to, criticize, previous, arguments, on, a, topic, and, emphatically, and, enthusiastically, insert, their, own, in, order, to, win, over, the, audience, it, was, conventional, in, herodotus, day, for, authors, to, publish, their, works, by, reciting, them, at, popular, festivals, according, to, lucian, herodotus, took, his, finished, work, straight, from, anatolia, to, the, olympic, games, and, read, the, entire, histories, to, the, assembled, spectators, in, one, sitting, receiving, rapturous, applause, at, the, end, of, it, 14, according, to, a, very, different, account, by, an, ancient, grammarian, herodotus, refused, to, begin, reading, his, work, at, the, festival, of, olympia, until, some, clouds, offered, him, a, bit, of, shade, by, which, time, the, assembly, had, dispersed, hence, the, proverbial, expression, herodotus, and, his, shade, to, describe, someone, who, misses, an, opportunity, through, delay, herodotus, recitation, at, olympia, was, a, favourite, theme, among, ancient, writers, and, there, is, another, interesting, variation, on, the, story, to, be, found, in, the, suda, that, of, photius, and, tzetzes, in, which, a, young, thucydides, happened, to, be, in, the, assembly, with, his, father, and, burst, into, tears, during, the, recital, herodotus, observed, prophetically, to, the, boy, s, father, your, son, s, soul, yearns, for, knowledge, eventually, thucydides, and, herodotus, became, close, enough, for, both, to, be, interred, in, thucydides, tomb, in, athens, such, at, least, was, the, opinion, of, marcellinus, in, his, life, of, thucydides, according, to, the, suda, he, was, buried, in, macedonian, pella, and, in, the, agora, in, thurii, 25, herodotus, announced, the, purpose, and, scope, of, his, work, at, the, beginning, of, his, histories, here, are, presented, the, results, of, the, inquiry, carried, out, by, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, the, purpose, is, to, prevent, the, traces, of, human, events, from, being, erased, by, time, and, to, preserve, the, fame, of, the, important, and, remarkable, achievements, produced, by, both, greeks, and, non, greeks, among, the, matters, covered, is, in, particular, the, cause, of, the, hostilities, between, greeks, and, non, greeks, his, record, of, the, achievements, of, others, was, an, achievement, in, itself, though, the, extent, of, it, has, been, debated, herodotus, place, in, history, and, his, significance, may, be, understood, according, to, the, traditions, within, which, he, worked, his, work, is, the, earliest, greek, prose, to, have, survived, intact, however, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, a, literary, critic, of, augustan, rome, listed, seven, predecessors, of, herodotus, describing, their, works, as, simple, unadorned, accounts, of, their, own, and, other, cities, and, people, greek, or, foreign, including, popular, legends, sometimes, melodramatic, and, na, ve, often, charming, all, traits, that, can, be, found, in, the, work, of, herodotus, himself, modern, historians, regard, the, chronology, as, uncertain, but, according, to, the, ancient, account, these, predecessors, included, dionysius, of, miletus, charon, of, lampsacus, hellanicus, of, lesbos, xanthus, of, lydia, and, the, best, attested, of, them, all, hecataeus, of, miletus, of, these, only, fragments, of, hecataeus, works, survived, and, the, authenticity, of, these, is, debatable, 27, but, they, provide, a, glimpse, into, the, kind, of, tradition, within, which, herodotus, wrote, his, own, histories, it, is, on, account, of, the, many, strange, stories, and, the, folk, tales, he, reported, that, his, critics, have, branded, him, the, father, of, lies, 10, even, his, own, contemporaries, found, reason, to, scoff, at, his, achievement, in, fact, one, modern, scholar, has, wondered, whether, herodotus, left, his, home, in, greek, anatolia, migrating, westwards, to, athens, and, beyond, because, his, own, countrymen, had, ridiculed, his, work, a, circumstance, possibly, hinted, at, in, an, epitaph, said, to, have, been, dedicated, to, herodotus, at, one, of, his, three, supposed, resting, places, thuria, herodotus, the, son, of, sphynx, lies, in, ionic, history, without, peer, a, dorian, born, who, fled, from, slander, s, brand, and, made, in, thuria, his, new, native, land, 13, yet, it, was, in, athens, where, his, most, formidable, contemporary, critics, could, be, found, in, 425, bc, which, is, about, the, time, that, herodotus, is, thought, by, many, scholars, to, have, died, the, athenian, comic, dramatist, aristophanes, created, the, acharnians, in, which, he, blames, the, peloponnesian, war, on, the, abduction, of, some, prostitutes, a, mocking, reference, to, herodotus, who, reported, the, persians, account, of, their, wars, with, greece, beginning, with, the, rapes, of, the, mythical, heroines, io, europa, medea, and, helen, similarly, the, athenian, historian, thucydides, dismissed, herodotus, as, a, story, teller, 191, thucydides, who, had, been, trained, in, rhetoric, became, the, model, for, subsequent, prose, writers, as, an, author, who, seeks, to, appear, firmly, in, control, of, his, material, whereas, with, his, frequent, digressions, herodotus, appeared, to, minimize, or, possibly, disguise, his, authorial, control, moreover, thucydides, developed, a, historical, topic, more, in, keeping, with, the, greek, world, view, focused, on, the, context, of, the, polis, or, city, state, the, interplay, of, civilizations, was, more, relevant, to, greeks, living, in, anatolia, such, as, herodotus, himself, for, whom, life, within, a, foreign, civilization, was, a, recent, memory, 191, before, the, persian, crisis, history, had, been, represented, among, the, greeks, only, by, local, or, family, traditions, the, wars, of, liberation, had, given, to, herodotus, the, first, genuinely, historical, inspiration, felt, by, a, greek, these, wars, showed, him, that, there, was, a, corporate, life, higher, than, that, of, the, city, of, which, the, story, might, be, told, and, they, offered, to, him, as, a, subject, the, drama, of, the, collision, between, east, and, west, with, him, the, spirit, of, history, was, born, into, greece, and, his, work, called, after, the, nine, muses, was, indeed, the, first, utterance, of, clio, though, herodotus, is, generally, considered, a, reliable, source, of, ancient, history, many, present, day, historians, believe, that, his, accounts, are, at, least, partially, inaccurate, attributing, the, observed, inconsistencies, in, the, histories, to, exaggeration, several, english, translations, of, herodotus, histories, are, readily, available, in, multiple, editions, the, most, readily, available, are, those, translated, by
