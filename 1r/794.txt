thucydides, j, u, s, d, d, i, z, thew, sid, ih, deez, ancient, greek, romanized, thoukud, d, s, c, 460, c, 400, bc, was, an, athenian, historian, and, general, his, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, recounts, the, fifth, century, bc, war, between, sparta, and, athens, until, the, year, 411, bc, thucydides, has, been, dubbed, the, father, of, scientific, history, by, those, who, accept, his, claims, to, have, applied, strict, standards, of, impartiality, and, evidence, gathering, and, analysis, of, cause, and, effect, without, reference, to, intervention, by, the, gods, as, outlined, in, his, introduction, to, his, work, thucydides, has, been, called, the, father, of, the, school, of, political, realism, which, views, the, political, behavior, of, individuals, and, the, subsequent, outcomes, of, relations, between, states, as, ultimately, mediated, by, and, constructed, upon, fear, and, self, interest, his, text, is, still, studied, at, universities, and, military, colleges, worldwide, the, melian, dialogue, is, regarded, as, a, seminal, text, of, international, relations, theory, while, his, version, of, pericles, s, funeral, oration, is, widely, studied, by, political, theorists, historians, and, students, of, the, classics, more, generally, thucydides, developed, an, understanding, of, human, nature, to, explain, behavior, in, such, crises, as, plagues, massacres, and, wars, in, spite, of, his, stature, as, a, historian, modern, historians, know, relatively, little, about, thucydides, s, life, the, most, reliable, information, comes, from, his, own, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, in, which, he, mentions, his, nationality, paternity, and, birthplace, thucydides, says, that, he, fought, in, the, war, contracted, the, plague, and, was, exiled, by, the, democracy, he, may, have, also, been, involved, in, quelling, the, samian, revolt, thucydides, identifies, himself, as, an, athenian, telling, us, that, his, father, s, name, was, olorus, and, that, he, was, from, the, athenian, deme, of, halimous, a, disputed, anecdote, from, his, early, life, says, that, when, thucydides, was, 10, 12, years, old, he, and, his, father, were, supposed, to, have, gone, to, the, agora, of, athens, where, the, young, thucydides, heard, a, lecture, by, the, historian, herodotus, according, to, some, accounts, the, young, thucydides, wept, with, joy, after, hearing, the, lecture, deciding, that, writing, history, would, be, his, life, s, calling, the, same, account, also, claims, that, after, the, lecture, herodotus, spoke, with, the, youth, and, his, father, stating, oloros, your, son, yearns, for, knowledge, in, all, essence, the, episode, is, most, likely, from, a, later, greek, or, roman, account, of, his, life, he, survived, the, plague, of, athens, which, killed, pericles, and, many, other, athenians, there, is, a, first, observation, of, acquired, immunity, he, also, records, that, he, owned, gold, mines, at, scapte, hyle, literally, dug, woodland, a, coastal, area, in, thrace, opposite, the, island, of, thasos, because, of, his, influence, in, the, thracian, region, thucydides, wrote, he, was, sent, as, a, strategos, general, to, thasos, in, 424, bc, during, the, winter, of, 424, 423, bc, the, spartan, general, brasidas, attacked, amphipolis, a, half, day, s, sail, west, from, thasos, on, the, thracian, coast, sparking, the, battle, of, amphipolis, eucles, the, athenian, commander, at, amphipolis, sent, to, thucydides, for, help, brasidas, aware, of, the, presence, of, thucydides, on, thasos, and, his, influence, with, the, people, of, amphipolis, and, afraid, of, help, arriving, by, sea, acted, quickly, to, offer, moderate, terms, to, the, amphipolitans, for, their, surrender, which, they, accepted, thus, when, thucydides, arrived, amphipolis, was, already, under, spartan, control, amphipolis, was, of, considerable, strategic, importance, and, news, of, its, fall, caused, great, consternation, in, athens, it, was, blamed, on, thucydides, although, he, claimed, that, it, was, not, his, fault, and, that, he, had, simply, been, unable, to, reach, it, in, time, because, of, his, failure, to, save, amphipolis, he, was, exiled, i, lived, through, the, whole, of, it, being, of, an, age, to, comprehend, events, and, giving, my, attention, to, them, in, order, to, know, the, exact, truth, about, them, it, was, also, my, fate, to, be, an, exile, from, my, country, for, twenty, years, after, my, command, at, amphipolis, and, being, present, with, both, parties, and, more, especially, with, the, peloponnesians, by, reason, of, my, exile, i, had, leisure, to, observe, affairs, somewhat, particularly, using, his, status, as, an, exile, from, athens, to, travel, freely, among, the, peloponnesian, allies, he, was, able, to, view, the, war, from, the, perspective, of, both, sides, thucydides, claimed, that, he, began, writing, his, history, as, soon, as, the, war, broke, out, because, he, thought, it, would, be, one, of, the, greatest, wars, waged, among, the, greeks, in, terms, of, scale, thucydides, an, athenian, wrote, the, history, of, the, war, between, the, peloponnesians, and, the, athenians, beginning, at, the, moment, that, it, broke, out, and, believing, that, it, would, be, a, great, war, and, more, worthy, of, relation, than, any, that, had, preceded, it, this, is, all, that, thucydides, wrote, about, his, own, life, but, a, few, other, facts, are, available, from, reliable, contemporary, sources, herodotus, wrote, that, the, name, olorus, thucydides, s, father, s, name, was, connected, with, thrace, and, thracian, royalty, thucydides, was, probably, connected, through, family, to, the, athenian, statesman, and, general, miltiades, and, his, son, cimon, leaders, of, the, old, aristocracy, supplanted, by, the, radical, democrats, cimon, s, maternal, grandfather, s, name, also, was, olorus, making, the, connection, quite, likely, another, thucydides, lived, before, the, historian, and, was, also, linked, with, thrace, making, a, family, connection, between, them, very, likely, as, well, combining, all, the, fragmentary, evidence, available, it, seems, that, his, family, had, owned, a, large, estate, in, thrace, one, that, even, contained, gold, mines, and, which, allowed, the, family, considerable, and, lasting, affluence, the, security, and, continued, prosperity, of, the, wealthy, estate, must, have, necessitated, formal, ties, with, local, kings, or, chieftains, which, explains, the, adoption, of, the, distinctly, thracian, royal, name, loros, into, the, family, once, exiled, thucydides, is, commonly, said, to, have, taken, up, permanent, residence, in, the, estate, and, given, his, ample, income, from, the, gold, mines, he, was, able, to, dedicate, himself, to, full, time, history, writing, and, research, in, essence, he, was, a, well, connected, gentleman, of, considerable, resources, who, after, involuntarily, retiring, from, the, political, and, military, spheres, decided, to, fund, his, own, historical, investigations, the, remaining, evidence, for, thucydides, s, life, comes, from, later, and, rather, less, reliable, ancient, sources, marcellinus, wrote, thucydides, s, biography, about, a, thousand, years, after, his, death, according, to, pausanias, someone, named, oenobius, had, a, law, passed, allowing, thucydides, to, return, to, athens, presumably, shortly, after, the, city, s, surrender, and, the, end, of, the, war, in, 404, bc, pausanias, goes, on, to, say, that, thucydides, was, murdered, on, his, way, back, to, athens, placing, his, tomb, near, the, melite, gate, many, doubt, this, account, seeing, evidence, to, suggest, he, lived, as, late, as, 397, bc, or, perhaps, slightly, later, plutarch, preserves, a, tradition, that, he, was, murdered, in, skapt, hul, and, that, his, remains, were, returned, to, athens, where, a, monument, to, him, was, erected, in, cimon, s, family, plot, there, are, problems, with, this, since, this, was, outside, thucydides, s, deme, and, the, tradition, goes, back, to, polemon, who, asserted, he, had, discovered, just, such, a, memorial, didymus, mentions, another, tomb, in, thrace, thucydides, s, narrative, breaks, off, in, the, middle, of, the, year, 411, bc, and, this, abrupt, end, has, traditionally, been, explained, as, due, to, his, death, while, writing, the, book, although, other, explanations, have, been, put, forward, during, his, description, of, the, athenian, plague, he, remarks, that, old, athenians, seemed, to, remember, a, verse, predicting, a, dorian, war, that, would, bring, about, a, plague, loimos, a, dispute, later, arose, when, some, claimed, that, the, saying, referred, to, the, advent, in, such, a, war, of, famine, or, starvation, limos, thucydides, draws, the, conclusion, that, people, adapt, their, recollections, to, their, present, state, of, suffering, were, the, same, situation, to, recur, but, with, people, experiencing, famine, rather, than, a, pestilence, the, verse, would, be, remembered, differently, in, terms, of, starvation, limos, thereby, cancelling, the, received, adage, about, a, plague, loimos, thucydides, admired, pericles, approving, of, his, power, over, the, people, and, showing, a, marked, distaste, for, the, demagogues, who, followed, him, he, did, not, approve, of, the, democratic, commoners, nor, of, the, radical, democracy, that, pericles, ushered, in, but, considered, democracy, acceptable, when, guided, by, a, good, leader, thucydides, s, presentation, of, events, is, generally, even, handed, for, example, he, does, not, minimize, the, negative, effect, of, his, own, failure, at, amphipolis, occasionally, however, strong, passions, break, through, as, in, his, scathing, appraisals, of, the, democratic, leaders, cleon, and, hyperbolus, sometimes, cleon, has, been, connected, with, thucydides, s, exile, it, has, been, argued, that, thucydides, was, moved, by, the, suffering, inherent, in, war, and, concerned, about, the, excesses, to, which, human, nature, is, prone, in, such, circumstances, as, in, his, analysis, of, the, atrocities, committed, during, the, civil, conflict, on, corcyra, which, includes, the, phrase, war, is, a, violent, teacher, thucydides, believed, that, the, peloponnesian, war, represented, an, event, of, unmatched, importance, as, such, he, began, to, write, the, history, at, the, onset, of, the, war, in, 431, bc, he, declared, his, intention, was, to, write, an, account, which, would, serve, as, a, possession, for, all, time, the, history, breaks, off, near, the, end, of, the, twenty, first, year, of, the, war, 411, bc, in, the, wake, of, the, athenian, defeat, at, syracuse, and, so, does, not, elaborate, on, the, final, seven, years, of, the, conflict, the, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, continued, to, be, modified, well, beyond, the, end, of, the, war, in, 404, bc, as, exemplified, by, a, reference, at, book, i, 1, 13, to, the, conclusion, of, the, war, after, his, death, thucydides, s, history, was, subdivided, into, eight, books, its, modern, title, is, the, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, this, subdivision, was, most, likely, made, by, librarians, and, archivists, themselves, being, historians, and, scholars, most, likely, working, in, the, library, of, alexandria, thucydides, is, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, first, true, historians, like, his, predecessor, herodotus, known, as, the, father, of, history, thucydides, places, a, high, value, on, eyewitness, testimony, and, writes, about, events, in, which, he, probably, took, part, he, also, assiduously, consulted, written, documents, and, interviewed, participants, about, the, events, that, he, recorded, unlike, herodotus, whose, stories, often, teach, that, a, hubris, invites, the, wrath, of, the, deities, thucydides, does, not, acknowledge, divine, intervention, in, human, affairs, thucydides, exerted, wide, historiographical, influence, on, subsequent, hellenistic, and, roman, historians, although, the, exact, description, of, his, style, in, relation, to, many, successive, historians, remains, unclear, readers, in, antiquity, often, placed, the, continuation, of, the, stylistic, legacy, of, the, history, in, the, writings, of, thucydides, s, putative, intellectual, successor, xenophon, such, readings, often, described, xenophon, s, treatises, as, attempts, to, finish, thucydides, s, history, many, of, these, interpretations, however, have, garnered, significant, scepticism, among, modern, scholars, such, as, dillery, who, spurn, the, view, of, interpreting, xenophon, qua, thucydides, arguing, that, the, latter, s, modern, history, defined, as, constructed, based, on, literary, and, historical, themes, is, antithetical, to, the, former, s, account, in, the, hellenica, which, diverges, from, the, hellenic, historiographical, tradition, in, its, absence, of, a, preface, or, introduction, to, the, text, and, the, associated, lack, of, an, overarching, concept, unifying, the, history, a, noteworthy, difference, between, thucydides, s, method, of, writing, history, and, that, of, modern, historians, is, thucydides, s, inclusion, of, lengthy, formal, speeches, that, as, he, states, were, literary, reconstructions, rather, than, quotations, of, what, was, said, or, perhaps, what, he, believed, ought, to, have, been, said, arguably, had, he, not, done, this, the, gist, of, what, was, said, would, not, otherwise, be, known, at, all, whereas, today, there, is, a, plethora, of, documentation, written, records, archives, and, recording, technology, for, historians, to, consult, therefore, thucydides, s, method, served, to, rescue, his, mostly, oral, sources, from, oblivion, we, do, not, know, how, these, historical, figures, spoke, thucydides, s, recreation, uses, a, heroic, stylistic, register, a, celebrated, example, is, pericles, funeral, oration, which, heaps, honour, on, the, dead, and, includes, a, defence, of, democracy, the, whole, earth, is, the, sepulchre, of, famous, men, they, are, honoured, not, only, by, columns, and, inscriptions, in, their, own, land, but, in, foreign, nations, on, memorials, graven, not, on, stone, but, in, the, hearts, and, minds, of, men, 2, 43, stylistically, the, placement, of, this, passage, also, serves, to, heighten, the, contrast, with, the, description, of, the, plague, in, athens, immediately, following, it, which, graphically, emphasizes, the, horror, of, human, mortality, thereby, conveying, a, powerful, sense, of, verisimilitude, though, many, lay, unburied, birds, and, beasts, would, not, touch, them, or, died, after, tasting, them, the, bodies, of, dying, men, lay, one, upon, another, and, half, dead, creatures, reeled, about, the, streets, and, gathered, round, all, the, fountains, in, their, longing, for, water, the, sacred, places, also, in, which, they, had, quartered, themselves, were, full, of, corpses, of, persons, who, had, died, there, just, as, they, were, for, as, the, disaster, passed, all, bounds, men, not, knowing, what, was, to, become, of, them, became, equally, contemptuous, of, the, property, of, and, the, dues, to, the, deities, all, the, burial, rites, before, in, use, were, entirely, upset, and, they, buried, the, bodies, as, best, they, could, many, from, want, of, the, proper, appliances, through, so, many, of, their, friends, having, died, already, had, recourse, to, the, most, shameless, sepultures, sometimes, getting, the, start, of, those, who, had, raised, a, pile, they, threw, their, own, dead, body, upon, the, stranger, s, pyre, and, ignited, it, sometimes, they, tossed, the, corpse, which, they, were, carrying, on, the, top, of, another, that, was, burning, and, so, went, off, 2, 52, thucydides, omits, discussion, of, the, arts, literature, or, the, social, milieu, in, which, the, events, in, his, book, take, place, and, in, which, he, grew, up, he, saw, himself, as, recording, an, event, not, a, period, and, went, to, considerable, lengths, to, exclude, what, he, deemed, frivolous, or, extraneous, paul, shorey, calls, thucydides, a, cynic, devoid, of, moral, sensibility, in, addition, he, notes, that, thucydides, conceived, of, human, nature, as, strictly, determined, by, one, s, physical, and, social, environments, alongside, basic, desires, francis, cornford, was, more, nuanced, thucydides, s, political, vision, was, informed, by, a, tragic, ethical, vision, in, which, man, isolated, from, and, opposed, to, nature, moves, along, a, narrow, path, unrelated, to, what, lies, beyond, and, lighted, only, by, a, few, dim, rays, of, human, foresight, gnome, or, by, the, false, wandering, fires, of, hope, he, bears, within, him, self, contained, his, destiny, in, his, own, character, and, this, with, the, purposes, which, arise, out, of, it, shapes, his, course, that, is, all, in, thucydides, view, that, we, can, say, except, that, now, and, again, out, of, the, surrounding, darkness, comes, the, blinding, strokes, of, fortune, unaccountable, and, unforeseen, thucydides, s, work, indicates, an, influence, from, the, teachings, of, the, sophists, that, contributes, substantially, to, the, thinking, and, character, of, his, history, possible, evidence, includes, his, skeptical, ideas, concerning, justice, and, morality, there, are, also, elements, within, the, history, such, as, his, views, on, nature, revolving, around, the, factual, empirical, and, the, non, anthropomorphic, which, suggest, that, he, was, at, least, aware, of, the, views, of, philosophers, such, as, anaxagoras, and, democritus, there, is, also, evidence, of, his, knowledge, concerning, some, of, the, corpus, of, hippocratic, medical, writings, thucydides, was, especially, interested, in, the, relationship, between, human, intelligence, and, judgment, fortune, and, necessity, and, the, idea, that, history, is, too, irrational, and, incalculable, to, predict, scholars, traditionally, viewed, thucydides, as, recognizing, and, teaching, the, lesson, that, democracies, need, leadership, but, that, leadership, can, be, dangerous, to, democracy, leo, strauss, in, the, city, and, man, locates, the, problem, in, the, nature, of, athenian, democracy, about, which, he, argued, thucydides, was, ambivalent, thucydides, s, wisdom, was, made, possible, by, the, periclean, democracy, which, had, the, effect, of, liberating, individual, daring, enterprise, and, questioning, spirit, this, liberation, by, permitting, the, growth, of, limitless, political, ambition, led, to, imperialism, and, eventually, to, civic, strife, for, canadian, historian, charles, norris, cochrane, 1889, 1945, thucydides, s, fastidious, devotion, to, observable, phenomena, focus, on, cause, and, effect, and, strict, exclusion, of, other, factors, anticipates, twentieth, century, scientific, positivism, cochrane, the, son, of, a, physician, speculated, that, thucydides, generally, and, especially, in, describing, the, plague, in, athens, was, influenced, by, the, methods, and, thinking, of, early, medical, writers, such, as, hippocrates, of, kos, after, world, war, ii, classical, scholar, jacqueline, de, romilly, pointed, out, that, the, problem, of, athenian, imperialism, was, one, of, thucydides, s, preoccupations, and, situated, his, history, in, the, context, of, greek, thinking, about, international, politics, since, the, appearance, of, her, study, other, scholars, further, examined, thucydides, s, treatment, of, realpolitik, other, scholars, have, brought, to, the, fore, the, literary, qualities, of, the, history, which, they, see, in, the, narrative, tradition, of, homer, and, hesiod, and, as, concerned, with, the, concepts, of, justice, and, suffering, found, in, plato, and, aristotle, and, questioned, in, aeschylus, and, sophocles, richard, ned, lebow, terms, thucydides, the, last, of, the, tragedians, stating, that, thucydides, drew, heavily, on, epic, poetry, and, tragedy, to, construct, his, history, which, not, surprisingly, is, also, constructed, as, a, narrative, in, this, view, the, blind, and, immoderate, behaviour, of, the, athenians, and, indeed, of, all, the, other, actors, although, perhaps, intrinsic, to, human, nature, leads, to, their, downfall, thus, his, history, could, serve, as, a, warning, to, leaders, to, be, more, prudent, by, putting, them, on, notice, that, someone, would, be, scrutinizing, their, actions, with, a, historian, s, objectivity, rather, than, a, chronicler, s, flattery, the, historian, j, b, bury, writes, that, the, work, of, thucydides, marks, the, longest, and, most, decisive, step, that, has, ever, been, taken, by, a, single, man, towards, making, history, what, it, is, today, historian, h, d, kitto, feels, that, thucydides, wrote, about, the, peloponnesian, war, not, because, it, was, the, most, significant, war, in, antiquity, but, because, it, caused, the, most, suffering, several, passages, of, thucydides, s, book, are, written, with, an, intensity, of, feeling, hardly, exceeded, by, sappho, herself, in, his, book, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, karl, popper, writes, that, thucydides, was, the, greatest, historian, perhaps, who, ever, lived, thucydides, s, work, popper, goes, on, to, say, represents, an, interpretation, a, point, of, view, and, in, this, we, need, not, agree, with, him, in, the, war, between, athenian, democracy, and, the, arrested, oligarchic, tribalism, of, sparta, we, must, never, forget, thucydides, s, involuntary, bias, and, that, his, heart, was, not, with, athens, his, native, city, although, he, apparently, did, not, belong, to, the, extreme, wing, of, the, athenian, oligarchic, clubs, who, conspired, throughout, the, war, with, the, enemy, he, was, certainly, a, member, of, the, oligarchic, party, and, a, friend, neither, of, the, athenian, people, the, demos, who, had, exiled, him, nor, of, its, imperialist, policy, thucydides, and, his, immediate, predecessor, herodotus, both, exerted, a, significant, influence, on, western, historiography, thucydides, does, not, mention, his, counterpart, by, name, but, his, famous, introductory, statement, is, thought, to, refer, to, him, to, hear, this, history, rehearsed, for, that, there, be, inserted, in, it, no, fables, shall, be, perhaps, not, delightful, but, he, that, desires, to, look, into, the, truth, of, things, done, and, which, according, to, the, condition, of, humanity, may, be, done, again, or, at, least, their, like, shall, find, enough, herein, to, make, him, think, it, profitable, and, it, is, compiled, rather, for, an, everlasting, possession, than, to, be, rehearsed, for, a, prize, 1, 22, herodotus, records, in, his, histories, not, only, the, events, of, the, persian, wars, but, also, geographical, and, ethnographical, information, as, well, as, the, fables, related, to, him, during, his, extensive, travels, typically, he, passes, no, definitive, judgment, on, what, he, has, heard, in, the, case, of, conflicting, or, unlikely, accounts, he, presents, both, sides, says, what, he, believes, and, then, invites, readers, to, decide, for, themselves, of, course, modern, historians, would, generally, leave, out, their, personal, beliefs, which, is, a, form, of, passing, judgment, upon, the, events, and, people, about, which, the, historian, is, reporting, the, work, of, herodotus, is, reported, to, have, been, recited, at, festivals, where, prizes, were, awarded, as, for, example, during, the, games, at, olympia, herodotus, views, history, as, a, source, of, moral, lessons, with, conflicts, and, wars, as, misfortunes, flowing, from, initial, acts, of, injustice, perpetuated, through, cycles, of, revenge, in, contrast, thucydides, claims, to, confine, himself, to, factual, reports, of, contemporary, political, and, military, events, based, on, unambiguous, first, hand, eye, witness, accounts, although, unlike, herodotus, he, does, not, reveal, his, sources, thucydides, views, life, exclusively, as, political, life, and, history, in, terms, of, political, history, conventional, moral, considerations, play, no, role, in, his, analysis, of, political, events, while, geographic, and, ethnographic, aspects, are, omitted, or, at, best, of, secondary, importance, subsequent, greek, historians, such, as, ctesias, diodorus, strabo, polybius, and, plutarch, held, up, thucydides, s, writings, as, a, model, of, truthful, history, lucian, refers, to, thucydides, as, having, given, greek, historians, their, law, requiring, them, to, say, what, had, been, done, greek, historians, of, the, fourth, century, bc, accepted, that, history, was, political, and, that, contemporary, history, was, the, proper, domain, of, a, historian, cicero, calls, herodotus, the, father, of, history, yet, the, greek, writer, plutarch, in, his, moralia, ethics, denigrated, herodotus, notably, calling, him, a, philobarbaros, a, barbarian, lover, to, the, detriment, of, the, greeks, unlike, thucydides, however, these, authors, all, continued, to, view, history, as, a, source, of, moral, lessons, thereby, infusing, their, works, with, personal, biases, generally, missing, from, thucydides, s, clear, eyed, non, judgmental, writings, focused, on, reporting, events, in, a, non, biased, manner, due, to, the, loss, of, the, ability, to, read, greek, thucydides, and, herodotus, were, largely, forgotten, during, the, middle, ages, in, western, europe, although, their, influence, continued, in, the, byzantine, world, in, europe, herodotus, become, known, and, highly, respected, only, in, the, late, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, century, as, an, ethnographer, in, part, due, to, the, discovery, of, america, where, customs, and, animals, were, encountered, that, were, even, more, surprising, than, what, he, had, related, during, the, reformation, moreover, information, about, middle, eastern, countries, in, the, histories, provided, a, basis, for, establishing, biblical, chronology, as, advocated, by, isaac, newton, the, first, european, translation, of, thucydides, into, latin, was, made, by, the, humanist, lorenzo, valla, between, 1448, and, 1452, and, the, first, greek, edition, was, published, by, aldo, manuzio, in, 1502, during, the, renaissance, however, thucydides, attracted, less, interest, among, western, european, historians, as, a, political, philosopher, than, his, successor, polybius, although, poggio, bracciolini, claimed, to, have, been, influenced, by, him, there, is, not, much, evidence, of, thucydides, s, influence, in, niccol, machiavelli, s, the, prince, 1513, which, held, that, the, chief, aim, of, a, new, prince, must, be, to, maintain, his, state, and, that, in, so, doing, he, is, often, compelled, to, act, against, faith, humanity, and, religion, later, historians, such, as, j, b, bury, however, have, noted, parallels, between, them, if, instead, of, a, history, thucydides, had, written, an, analytical, treatise, on, politics, with, particular, reference, to, the, athenian, empire, it, is, probable, that, he, could, have, forestalled, machiavelli, the, whole, innuendo, of, the, thucydidean, treatment, of, history, agrees, with, the, fundamental, postulate, of, machiavelli, the, supremacy, of, reason, of, state, to, maintain, a, state, said, the, florentine, thinker, a, statesman, is, often, compelled, to, act, against, faith, humanity, and, religion, but, the, true, machiavelli, not, the, machiavelli, of, fable, entertained, an, ideal, italy, for, the, italians, italy, freed, from, the, stranger, and, in, the, service, of, this, ideal, he, desired, to, see, his, speculative, science, of, politics, applied, thucydides, has, no, political, aim, in, view, he, was, purely, a, historian, but, it, was, part, of, the, method, of, both, alike, to, eliminate, conventional, sentiment, and, morality, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, english, political, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, whose, leviathan, advocated, absolute, monarchy, admired, thucydides, and, in, 1628, was, the, first, to, translate, his, writings, into, english, directly, from, greek, thucydides, hobbes, and, machiavelli, are, together, considered, the, founding, fathers, of, western, political, realism, according, to, which, state, policy, must, primarily, or, solely, focus, on, the, need, to, maintain, military, and, economic, power, rather, than, on, ideals, or, ethics, nineteenth, century, positivist, historians, stressed, what, they, saw, as, thucydides, s, seriousness, his, scientific, objectivity, and, his, advanced, handling, of, evidence, a, virtual, cult, following, developed, among, such, german, philosophers, as, friedrich, schelling, friedrich, schlegel, and, friedrich, nietzsche, who, claimed, that, the, portrayer, of, man, that, culture, of, the, most, impartial, knowledge, of, the, world, finds, its, last, glorious, flower, the, late, eighteenth, century, swiss, historian, johannes, von, m, ller, described, thucydides, as, the, favourite, author, of, the, greatest, and, noblest, men, and, one, of, the, best, teachers, of, the, wisdom, of, human, life, for, eduard, meyer, thomas, babington, macaulay, and, leopold, von, ranke, who, initiated, modern, source, based, history, writing, thucydides, was, again, the, model, historian, generals, and, statesmen, loved, him, the, world, he, drew, was, theirs, an, exclusive, power, brokers, club, it, is, no, accident, that, even, today, thucydides, turns, up, as, a, guiding, spirit, in, military, academies, neocon, think, tanks, and, the, writings, of, men, like, henry, kissinger, whereas, herodotus, has, been, the, choice, of, imaginative, novelists, michael, ondaatje, s, novel, the, english, patient, and, the, film, based, on, it, boosted, the, sale, of, the, histories, to, a, wholly, unforeseen, degree, and, as, food, for, a, starved, soul, of, an, equally, imaginative, foreign, correspondent, from, iron, curtain, poland, ryszard, kapuscinski, these, historians, also, admired, herodotus, however, as, social, and, ethnographic, history, increasingly, came, to, be, recognized, as, complementary, to, political, history, in, the, twentieth, century, this, trend, gave, rise, to, the, works, of, johan, huizinga, marc, bloch, and, fernand, braudel, who, pioneered, the, study, of, long, term, cultural, and, economic, developments, and, the, patterns, of, everyday, life, the, annales, school, which, exemplifies, this, direction, has, been, viewed, as, extending, the, tradition, of, herodotus, at, the, same, time, thucydides, s, influence, was, increasingly, important, in, the, area, of, international, relations, during, the, cold, war, through, the, work, of, hans, morgenthau, leo, strauss, and, edward, carr, the, tension, between, the, thucydidean, and, herodotean, traditions, extends, beyond, historical, research, according, to, irving, kristol, self, described, founder, of, american, neoconservatism, thucydides, wrote, the, favorite, neoconservative, text, on, foreign, affairs, and,

of, herodotus, suggests, that, at, least, in, his, graduate, school, days, during, the, cold, war, professing, admiration, of, thucydides, served, as, a, form, of, self, presentation, to, be, an, admirer, of, thucydides, history, with, its, deep, cynicism, about, political, rhetorical, and, ideological, hypocrisy, with, its, all, too, recognizable, protagonists, a, liberal, yet, imperialistic, democracy, and, an, authoritarian, oligarchy, engaged, in, a, war, of, attrition, fought, by, proxy, at, the, remote, fringes, of, empire, was, to, advertise, yourself, as, a, hardheaded, connoisseur, of, global, realpolitik, another, contemporary, historian, believes, that, while, it, is, true, that, critical, history, began, with, thucydides, one, may, also, argue, that, herodotus, looking, at, the, past, as, a, reason, why, the, present, is, the, way, it, is, and, to, search, for, causality, for, events, beyond, the, realms, of, tyche, and, the, gods, was, a, much, larger, step
