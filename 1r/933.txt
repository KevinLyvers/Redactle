according, to, the, christian, historian, sozomen, libanius, was, supposed, to, have, said, on, his, deathbed, that, john, would, have, been, his, successor, if, the, christians, had, not, taken, him, from, us, john, lived, in, extreme, asceticism, and, became, a, hermit, in, about, 375, he, spent, the, next, two, years, continually, standing, scarcely, sleeping, and, committing, the, bible, to,

reader, in, the, church, of, antioch, by, zeno, of, verona, upon, the, latter, s, return, from, jerusalem, later, he, was, ordained, as, a, deacon, in, 381, by, the, bishop, meletius, of, antioch, who, was, not, then, in, communion, with, alexandria, and, rome, after, the, death, of, meletius, john, separated, himself, from, the, followers, of, meletius, without, joining, paulinus, the, rival, of, meletius, for, the, bishopric, of, antioch, but, after, the, death, of, paulinus, 388, he, was, ordained, a, presbyter, priest, by, evagrius, of, antioch, the, successor, of, paulinus, by, the, eustathian, faction, in, the, city, he, was, destined, later, to, bring, about, reconciliation, between, flavian, i, of, antioch, alexandria, and, rome, thus, bringing, those, three, sees, into, communion, for, the, first, time, in, nearly, seventy, years, in, antioch, over, the, course, of, twelve, years, 386, 397, john, gained, popularity, because, of, the, eloquence, of, his, public, speaking, at, the, golden, church, antioch, s, cathedral, especially, his, insightful, expositions, of, bible, passages, and, moral, teaching, the, most, valuable, of, his, works, from, this, period, are, his, homilies, on, various, books, of, the, bible, he, emphasised, charitable, giving, and, was, concerned, with, the, spiritual, and, temporal, needs, of, the, poor, he, spoke, against, abuse, of, wealth, and, personal, property, do, you, wish, to, honour, the, body, of, christ, do, not, ignore, him, when, he, is, naked, do, not, pay, him, homage, in, the, temple, clad, in, silk, only, then, to, neglect, him, outside, where, he, is, cold, and, ill, clad, he, who, said, this, is, my, body, is, the, same, who, said, you, saw, me, hungry, and, you, gave, me, no, food, and, whatever, you, did, to, the, least, of, my, brothers, you, did, also, to, me, what, good, is, it, if, the, eucharistic, table, is, overloaded, with, golden, chalices, when, your, brother, is, dying, of, hunger, start, by, satisfying, his, hunger, and, then, with, what, is, left, you, may, adorn, the, altar, as, well, his, straightforward, understanding, of, the, scriptures, in, contrast, to, the, alexandrian, tendency, towards, allegorical, interpretation, meant, that, the, themes, of, his, talks, were, practical, explaining, the, bible, s, application, to, everyday, life, such, straightforward, preaching, helped, chrysostom, to, garner, popular, support, one, incident, that, happened, during, his, service, in, antioch, illustrates, the, influence, of, his, homilies, when, chrysostom, arrived, in, antioch, flavian, the, bishop, of, the, city, had, to, intervene, with, emperor, theodosius, i, on, behalf, of, citizens, who, had, gone, on, a, rampage, mutilating, statues, of, the, emperor, and, his, family, during, the, weeks, of, lent, in, 387, john, preached, more, than, twenty, homilies, in, which, he, entreated, the, people, to, see, the, error, of, their, ways, these, made, a, lasting, impression, on, the, general, population, of, the, city, many, pagans, converted, to, christianity, as, a, result, of, the, homilies, the, city, was, ultimately, spared, from, severe, consequences, in, the, autumn, of, 397, john, was, appointed, archbishop, of, constantinople, after, having, been, nominated, without, his, knowledge, by, the, eunuch, eutropius, he, had, to, leave, antioch, in, secret, due, to, fears, that, the, departure, of, such, a, popular, figure, would, cause, civil, unrest, during, his, time, as, archbishop, he, adamantly, refused, to, host, lavish, social, gatherings, which, made, him, popular, with, the, common, people, but, unpopular, with, wealthy, citizens, and, the, clergy, his, reforms, of, the, clergy, were, also, unpopular, he, told, visiting, regional, preachers, to, return, to, the, churches, they, were, meant, to, be, serving, without, any, pay, out, also, he, founded, a, number, of, hospitals, in, constantinople, his, time, in, constantinople, was, more, tumultuous, than, his, time, in, antioch, theophilus, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, wanted, to, bring, constantinople, under, his, sway, and, opposed, john, s, appointment, to, constantinople, theophilus, had, disciplined, four, egyptian, monks, known, as, the, tall, brothers, over, their, support, of, origen, s, teachings, they, fled, to, john, and, were, welcomed, by, him, theophilus, therefore, accused, john, of, being, too, partial, to, the, teaching, of, origen, he, made, another, enemy, in, aelia, eudoxia, wife, of, emperor, arcadius, who, assumed, that, john, s, denunciations, of, extravagance, in, feminine, dress, were, aimed, at, her, eudoxia, theophilus, and, other, of, his, enemies, held, a, synod, in, 403, the, synod, of, the, oak, to, charge, john, in, which, his, connection, to, origen, was, used, against, him, it, resulted, in, his, deposition, and, banishment, he, was, called, back, by, arcadius, almost, immediately, as, the, people, became, tumultuous, over, his, departure, even, threatening, to, burn, the, imperial, palace, there, was, an, earthquake, the, night, of, his, arrest, which, eudoxia, took, for, a, sign, of, god, s, anger, prompting, her, to, ask, arcadius, for, john, s, reinstatement, peace, was, short, lived, a, silver, statue, of, eudoxia, was, erected, in, the, augustaion, near, his, cathedral, the, constantinian, hagia, sophia, john, denounced, the, dedication, ceremonies, as, pagan, and, spoke, against, the, empress, in, harsh, terms, again, herodias, raves, again, she, dances, and, again, desires, to, receive, john, s, head, on, a, charger, an, allusion, to, the, events, surrounding, the, death, of, john, the, baptist, once, again, he, was, banished, this, time, to, the, caucasus, in, abkhazia, his, banishment, sparked, riots, among, his, supporters, in, the, capital, and, in, the, fighting, the, cathedral, built, by, constantius, ii, was, burnt, down, necessitating, the, construction, of, the, second, cathedral, on, the, site, the, theodosian, hagia, sophia, around, 405, john, began, to, lend, moral, and, financial, support, to, christian, monks, who, were, enforcing, the, emperors, anti, pagan, laws, by, destroying, temples, and, shrines, in, phoenicia, and, nearby, regions, the, causes, of, john, s, exile, are, not, clear, though, jennifer, barry, suggests, that, they, have, to, do, with, his, connections, to, arianism, other, historians, including, wendy, mayer, and, geoffrey, dunn, have, argued, that, the, surplus, of, evidence, reveals, a, struggle, between, johannite, and, anti, johannite, camps, in, constantinople, soon, after, john, s, departure, and, for, a, few, years, after, his, death, faced, with, exile, john, chrysostom, wrote, an, appeal, for, help, to, three, churchmen, pope, innocent, i, venerius, the, bishop, of, mediolanum, milan, and, chromatius, the, bishop, of, aquileia, in, 1872, church, historian, william, stephens, wrote, the, patriarch, of, the, eastern, rome, appeals, to, the, great, bishops, of, the, west, as, the, champions, of, an, ecclesiastical, discipline, which, he, confesses, himself, unable, to, enforce, or, to, see, any, prospect, of, establishing, no, jealousy, is, entertained, of, the, patriarch, of, the, old, rome, by, the, patriarch, of, the, new, rome, the, interference, of, innocent, is, courted, a, certain, primacy, is, accorded, him, but, at, the, same, time, he, is, not, addressed, as, a, supreme, arbitrator, assistance, and, sympathy, are, solicited, from, him, as, from, an, elder, brother, and, two, other, prelates, of, italy, are, joint, recipients, with, him, of, the, appeal, pope, innocent, i, protested, john, s, banishment, from, constantinople, to, the, town, of, cucusus, g, ksun, in, cappadocia, but, to, no, avail, innocent, sent, a, delegation, to, intercede, on, behalf, of, john, in, 405, it, was, led, by, gaudentius, of, brescia, gaudentius, and, his, companions, two, bishops, encountered, many, difficulties, and, never, reached, their, goal, of, entering, constantinople, john, wrote, letters, which, still, held, great, influence, in, constantinople, as, a, result, of, this, he, was, further, exiled, from, cucusus, where, he, stayed, from, 404, to, 407, to, pitiunt, pityus, in, modern, georgia, he, never, reached, this, destination, alive, as, he, died, at, comana, pontica, modern, day, g, menek, tokat, turkey, on, 14, september, 407, during, the, journey, he, died, in, the, presbyterium, or, community, of, the, clergy, belonging, to, the, church, of, saint, basiliscus, of, comana, his, last, words, are, said, to, have, been, glory, be, to, god, for, all, things, john, came, to, be, venerated, as, a, saint, soon, after, his, death, almost, immediately, after, an, anonymous, supporter, of, john, known, as, pseudo, martyrius, wrote, a, funeral, oration, to, reclaim, john, as, a, symbol, of, christian, orthodoxy, but, three, decades, later, some, of, his, adherents, in, constantinople, remained, in, schism, proclus, archbishop, of, constantinople, 434, 446, hoping, to, bring, about, the, reconciliation, of, the, johannites, preached, a, homily, praising, his, predecessor, in, the, church, of, hagia, sophia, he, said, o, john, your, life, was, filled, with, sorrow, but, your, death, was, glorious, your, grave, is, blessed, and, reward, is, great, by, the, grace, and, mercy, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, o, graced, one, having, conquered, the, bounds, of, time, and, place, love, has, conquered, space, unforgetting, memory, has, annihilated, the, limits, and, place, does, not, hinder, the, miracles, of, the, saint, these, homilies, helped, to, mobilize, public, opinion, and, the, patriarch, received, permission, from, the, emperor, to, return, chrysostom, s, relics, to, constantinople, where, they, were, enshrined, in, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, on, 28, january, 438, the, eastern, orthodox, church, commemorates, him, as, a, great, ecumenical, teacher, with, basil, the, great, and, gregory, the, theologian, these, three, saints, in, addition, to, having, their, own, individual, commemorations, throughout, the, year, are, commemorated, together, on, 30, january, a, feast, known, as, the, synaxis, of, the, three, hierarchs, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, there, are, several, feast, days, dedicated, to, him, in, 1908, pope, pius, x, named, him, the, patron, saint, of, preachers, some, 700, sermons, and, 246, letters, by, john, chrysostom, survive, plus, biblical, commentaries, moral, discourses, and, theological, treatises, the, best, known, of, his, many, homilies, is, an, extremely, brief, one, the, paschal, homily, hieratikon, which, is, read, at, the, first, service, of, pascha, easter, the, midnight, orthros, matins, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, chrysostom, s, extant, homiletical, works, are, vast, including, many, hundreds, of, exegetical, homilies, on, both, the, new, testament, especially, the, works, of, paul, the, apostle, and, the, old, testament, particularly, on, genesis, among, his, exegetical, works, are, sixty, seven, homilies, on, genesis, fifty, nine, on, the, psalms, ninety, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, eighty, eight, on, the, gospel, of, john, and, fifty, five, on, the, acts, of, the, apostles, the, homilies, were, written, down, by, stenographers, and, subsequently, circulated, revealing, a, style, that, tended, to, be, direct, and, greatly, personal, but, formed, by, the, rhetorical, conventions, of, his, time, and, place, in, general, his, homiletical, theology, displays, much, characteristic, of, the, antiochian, school, i, e, more, literal, in, interpreting, biblical, events, but, he, also, uses, a, good, deal, of, the, allegorical, interpretation, more, associated, with, the, alexandrian, school, john, s, social, and, religious, world, was, formed, by, the, continuing, and, pervasive, presence, of, paganism, in, the, life, of, the, city, one, of, his, regular, topics, was, the, paganism, in, the, culture, of, constantinople, and, in, his, homilies, he, thunders, against, popular, pagan, amusements, the, theatre, horseraces, and, the, revelry, surrounding, holidays, in, particular, he, criticizes, christians, for, taking, part, in, such, activities, if, you, ask, who, is, amos, or, obadiah, how, many, apostles, there, were, or, prophets, they, stand, mute, but, if, you, ask, them, about, the, horses, or, drivers, they, answer, with, more, solemnity, than, sophists, or, rhetors, one, of, the, recurring, features, of, john, s, homilies, is, his, emphasis, on, care, for, the, needy, echoing, themes, found, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, he, calls, upon, the, rich, to, lay, aside, materialism, in, favor, of, helping, the, poor, often, employing, all, of, his, rhetorical, skills, to, shame, wealthy, people, to, abandon, conspicuous, consumption, do, you, pay, such, honor, to, your, excrements, as, to, receive, them, into, a, silver, chamber, pot, when, another, man, made, in, the, image, of, god, is, perishing, in, the, cold, along, these, lines, he, wrote, often, about, the, need, for, almsgiving, and, its, importance, alongside, fasting, and, prayer, e, g, prayer, without, almsgiving, is, unfruitful, cyril, of, alexandria, attributed, the, destruction, of, the, ephesian, temple, of, artemis, to, john, chrysostom, referring, to, him, as, the, destroyer, of, the, demons, and, overthrower, of, the, temple, of, diana, a, later, archbishop, of, constantinople, proclus, repeated, the, allegation, saying, in, ephesus, he, despoiled, the, art, of, midas, both, claims, are, considered, spurious, during, his, first, two, years, as, a, presbyter, in, antioch, 386, 387, john, denounced, jews, and, christians, in, a, series, of, eight, homilies, delivered, to, christians, in, his, congregation, who, were, taking, part, in, jewish, festivals, and, other, jewish, observances, it, is, disputed, whether, the, main, targets, were, specifically, the, so, called, judaizers, or, jews, in, general, his, homilies, were, expressed, in, the, conventional, manner, using, the, uncompromising, rhetorical, form, known, as, the, psogos, greek, blame, censure, one, of, the, purposes, of, these, homilies, was, to, prevent, christians, from, participating, in, jewish, customs, and, thus, prevent, the, perceived, erosion, of, chrysostom, s, flock, in, his, homilies, john, criticized, those, judaizing, christians, who, were, participating, in, jewish, festivals, and, taking, part, in, other, jewish, observances, such, as, the, shabbat, submitted, to, circumcision, and, made, pilgrimage, to, jewish, holy, places, there, had, been, a, revival, of, jewish, faith, and, tolerance, in, antioch, in, 361, so, chrysostom, s, followers, and, the, greater, christian, community, were, in, contact, with, jews, frequently, and, chrysostom, was, concerned, that, this, interaction, would, draw, christians, away, from, their, faith, identity, john, claimed, that, synagogues, were, full, of, christians, especially, christian, women, on, the, shabbats, and, jewish, festivals, because, they, loved, the, solemnity, of, the, jewish, liturgy, and, enjoyed, listening, to, the, shofar, on, rosh, hashanah, and, applauded, famous, preachers, in, accordance, with, the, contemporary, custom, due, to, chrysostom, s, stature, in, the, christian, church, both, locally, and, within, the, greater, church, hierarchy, his, sermons, were, fairly, successful, in, spreading, anti, jewish, sentiment, in, greek, the, homilies, are, called, kata, ioudai, n, which, is, translated, as, adversus, judaeos, in, latin, and, against, the, jews, in, english, the, original, benedictine, editor, of, the, homilies, bernard, de, montfaucon, gives, the, following, footnote, to, the, title, a, discourse, against, the, jews, but, it, was, delivered, against, those, who, were, judaizing, and, keeping, the, fasts, with, them, according, to, patristics, scholars, opposition, to, any, particular, view, during, the, late, 4th, century, was, conventionally, expressed, in, a, manner, using, the, rhetorical, form, known, as, the, psogos, whose, literary, conventions, were, to, vilify, opponents, in, an, uncompromising, manner, thus, it, has, been, argued, that, to, call, chrysostom, an, anti, semite, is, to, employ, anachronistic, terminology, in, a, way, incongruous, with, historical, context, and, record, this, does, not, preclude, assertions, that, chrysostom, s, theology, was, a, form, of, anti, jewish, supersessionism, his, sermons, against, jews, gave, further, momentum, to, the, idea, that, jews, are, collectively, responsible, for, the, death, of, jesus, john, chrysostom, s, most, notable, discourse, in, this, regard, is, his, fourth, homily, on, romans, 1, 26, where, he, argues, as, follows, all, these, affections, then, were, vile, but, chiefly, the, mad, lust, after, males, for, the, soul, is, more, the, sufferer, in, sins, and, more, dishonored, than, the, body, in, diseases, have, done, an, insult, to, nature, itself, and, a, yet, more, disgraceful, thing, than, these, is, it, when, even, the, women, seek, after, these, intercourses, who, ought, to, have, more, sense, of, shame, than, men, he, says, the, active, male, victimizes, the, passive, male, in, a, way, that, leaves, him, more, enduringly, dishonored, than, even, a, victim, of, murder, since, the, victim, of, this, act, must, live, under, the, shame, of, the, insolency, the, victim, of, a, murder, by, contrast, carries, no, dishonor, he, asserts, that, punishment, will, be, found, in, hell, for, such, transgressors, and, that, women, can, be, guilty, of, the, sin, as, much, as, men, chrysostom, argues, that, the, male, passive, partner, has, effectively, renounced, his, manhood, and, become, a, woman, such, an, individual, deserves, to, be, driven, out, and, stoned, he, attributes, the, cause, to, luxury, do, not, he, means, paul, because, you, have, heard, that, they, burned, suppose, that, the, evil, was, only, in, desire, for, the, greater, part, of, it, came, of, their, luxuriousness, which, also, kindled, into, flame, their, lust, according, to, scholar, michael, carden, chrysostom, was, particularly, influential, in, shaping, early, christian, thought, that, same, sex, desire, was, an, evil, claiming, that, he, altered, a, traditional, interpretation, of, sodom, as, a, place, of, inhospitality, to, one, where, the, sexual, transgressions, of, the, sodomites, became, paramount, however, other, scholars, such, as, kruger, and, nortj, meyer, dispute, this, arguing, that, the, author, of, the, epistle, of, jude, already, interpreted, the, sin, of, sodom, as, homosexuality, in, the, new, testament, apart, from, his, homilies, a, number, of, john, s, other, treatises, have, had, a, lasting, influence, one, such, work, is, john, s, early, treatise, against, those, who, oppose, the, monastic, life, written, while, he, was, a, deacon, sometime, before, 386, which, was, directed, to, parents, pagan, as, well, as, christian, whose, sons, were, contemplating, a, monastic, vocation, chrysostom, wrote, that, already, in, his, day, it, was, customary, for, antiochenes, to, send, their, sons, to, be, educated, by, monks, another, important, treatise, written, by, john, is, titled, on, the, priesthood, written, 390, 391, it, contains, in, book, 1, an, account, of, his, early, years, and, a, defence, of, his, flight, from, ordination, by, bishop, meletios, of, antioch, and, then, proceeds, in, later, books, to, expound, on, his, exalted, understanding, of, the, priesthood, two, other, notable, books, by, john, are, instructions, to, catechumens, and, on, the, incomprehensibility, of, the, divine, nature, in, addition, he, wrote, a, series, of, letters, to, the, deaconess, olympias, of, which, seventeen, are, extant, beyond, his, preaching, the, other, lasting, legacy, of, john, is, his, influence, on, christian, liturgy, two, of, his, writings, are, particularly, notable, he, harmonized, the, liturgical, life, of, the, church, by, revising, the, prayers, and, rubrics, of, the, divine, liturgy, or, celebration, of, the, holy, eucharist, to, this, day, eastern, orthodox, and, eastern, catholic, churches, of, the, byzantine, rite, typically, celebrate, the, divine, liturgy, of, saint, john, chrysostom, as, the, normal, eucharistic, liturgy, although, his, exact, connection, with, it, remains, a, matter, of, debate, among, experts, during, a, time, when, city, clergy, were, subject, to, criticism, for, their, high, lifestyle, john, was, determined, to, reform, his, clergy, in, constantinople, these, efforts, were, met, with, resistance, and, limited, success, he, was, an, excellent, preacher, whose, homilies, and, writings, are, still, studied, and, quoted, as, a, theologian, he, has, been, and, continues, to, be, very, important, in, eastern, christianity, and, is, generally,
