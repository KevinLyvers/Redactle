liked, to, visit, moscow, s, theaters, and, museums, in, 1978, gorbachev, was, appointed, to, the, central, committee, s, secretariat, for, agriculture, 25th, term, replacing, his, old, patron, kulakov, who, had, died, of, a, heart, attack, gorbachev, concentrated, his, attentions, on, agriculture, the, harvests, of, 1979, 1980, and, 1981, were, all, poor, due, largely, to, weather, conditions, and, the, country, had, to, import, increasing, quantities, of, grain, he, had, growing, concerns, about, the, country, s, agricultural, management, system, coming, to, regard, it, as, overly, centralized, and, requiring, more, bottom, up, decision, making, he, raised, these, points, at, his, first, speech, at, a, central, committee, plenum, given, in, july, 1978, he, began, to, have, concerns, about, other, policies, too, in, december, 1979, the, soviets, sent, the, armed, forces, into, neighbouring, afghanistan, to, support, its, soviet, aligned, government, against, islamist, insurgents, gorbachev, privately, thought, it, a, mistake, at, times, he, openly, supported, the, government, position, in, october, 1980, he, for, instance, endorsed, soviet, calls, for, poland, s, marxist, leninist, government, to, crack, down, on, growing, internal, dissent, in, that, country, that, same, month, he, was, promoted, from, a, candidate, member, to, a, full, member, of, the, politburo, 25th, term, the, highest, decision, making, authority, in, the, communist, party, at, the, time, he, was, the, politburo, s, youngest, member, after, brezhnev, s, death, in, november, 1982, andropov, succeeded, him, as, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, the, de, facto, leader, in, the, soviet, union, gorbachev, was, enthusiastic, about, the, appointment, however, although, gorbachev, hoped, that, andropov, would, introduce, liberalizing, reforms, the, latter, carried, out, only, personnel, shifts, rather, than, structural, change, gorbachev, became, andropov, s, closest, ally, in, the, politburo, with, andropov, s, encouragement, gorbachev, sometimes, chaired, politburo, meetings, andropov, encouraged, gorbachev, to, expand, into, policy, areas, other, than, agriculture, preparing, him, for, future, higher, office, in, april, 1983, in, a, sign, of, growing, ascendancy, gorbachev, delivered, the, annual, speech, marking, the, birthday, of, the, soviet, founder, vladimir, lenin, this, required, him, re, reading, many, of, lenin, s, later, writings, in, which, the, latter, had, called, for, reform, in, the, context, of, the, new, economic, policy, of, the, 1920s, and, encouraged, gorbachev, s, own, conviction, that, reform, was, needed, in, may, 1983, gorbachev, was, sent, to, canada, where, he, met, prime, minister, pierre, trudeau, and, spoke, to, the, canadian, parliament, there, he, met, and, befriended, the, soviet, ambassador, aleksandr, yakovlev, who, later, became, a, key, political, ally, in, february, 1984, andropov, died, on, his, deathbed, he, indicated, his, desire, that, gorbachev, succeed, him, many, in, the, central, committee, nevertheless, thought, the, 53, year, old, gorbachev, was, too, young, and, inexperienced, instead, konstantin, chernenko, a, longstanding, brezhnev, ally, was, appointed, general, secretary, but, he, too, was, in, very, poor, health, chernenko, was, often, too, sick, to, chair, politburo, meetings, with, gorbachev, stepping, in, last, minute, gorbachev, continued, to, cultivate, allies, both, in, the, kremlin, and, beyond, and, also, gave, the, main, speech, at, a, conference, on, soviet, ideology, where, he, angered, party, hardliners, by, implying, that, the, country, required, reform, in, april, 1984, gorbachev, was, appointed, chair, of, the, foreign, affairs, committee, of, the, soviet, legislature, a, largely, honorific, position, in, june, he, traveled, to, italy, as, a, soviet, representative, for, the, funeral, of, italian, communist, party, leader, enrico, berlinguer, and, in, september, to, sofia, bulgaria, to, attend, celebrations, of, the, fortieth, anniversary, of, its, liberation, from, the, nazis, by, the, red, army, in, december, he, visited, britain, at, the, request, of, its, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, she, was, aware, that, he, was, a, potential, reformer, and, wanted, to, meet, him, at, the, end, of, the, visit, thatcher, said, i, like, mr, gorbachev, we, can, do, business, together, he, felt, that, the, visit, helped, to, erode, andrei, gromyko, s, dominance, of, soviet, foreign, policy, while, at, the, same, time, sending, a, signal, to, the, united, states, government, that, he, wanted, to, improve, soviet, us, relations, on, 10, march, 1985, chernenko, died, gromyko, proposed, gorbachev, as, the, next, general, secretary, as, a, longstanding, party, member, gromyko, s, recommendation, carried, great, weight, among, the, central, committee, gorbachev, expected, much, opposition, to, his, nomination, as, general, secretary, but, ultimately, the, rest, of, the, politburo, supported, him, shortly, after, chernenko, s, death, the, politburo, unanimously, elected, gorbachev, as, his, successor, they, wanted, him, rather, than, another, elderly, leader, he, thus, became, the, eighth, leader, of, the, soviet, union, few, in, the, government, imagined, that, he, would, be, as, radical, a, reformer, as, he, proved, although, he, was, not, a, well, known, figure, to, the, soviet, public, there, was, widespread, relief, that, the, new, leader, was, not, elderly, and, ailing, gorbachev, s, first, public, appearance, as, leader, was, at, chernenko, s, red, square, funeral, held, on, 14, march, two, months, after, being, elected, he, left, moscow, for, the, first, time, traveling, to, leningrad, where, he, spoke, to, assembled, crowds, in, june, he, traveled, to, ukraine, in, july, to, belarus, and, in, september, to, tyumen, oblast, urging, party, members, in, these, areas, to, take, more, responsibility, for, fixing, local, problems, gorbachev, s, leadership, style, differed, from, that, of, his, predecessors, he, would, stop, to, talk, to, civilians, on, the, street, forbade, the, display, of, his, portrait, at, the, 1985, red, square, holiday, celebrations, and, encouraged, frank, and, open, discussions, at, politburo, meetings, to, the, west, gorbachev, was, seen, as, a, more, moderate, and, less, threatening, soviet, leader, some, western, commentators, however, believed, this, an, act, to, lull, western, governments, into, a, false, sense, of, security, his, wife, was, his, closest, adviser, and, took, on, the, unofficial, role, of, a, first, lady, by, appearing, with, him, on, foreign, trips, her, public, visibility, was, a, breach, of, standard, practice, and, generated, resentment, his, other, close, aides, were, georgy, shakhnazarov, and, anatoly, chernyaev, gorbachev, was, aware, that, the, politburo, could, remove, him, from, office, and, that, he, could, not, pursue, more, radical, reform, without, a, majority, of, supporters, in, the, politburo, he, sought, to, remove, several, older, members, from, the, politburo, encouraging, grigory, romanov, nikolai, tikhonov, and, viktor, grishin, into, retirement, he, promoted, gromyko, to, head, of, state, a, largely, ceremonial, role, with, little, influence, and, moved, his, own, ally, eduard, shevardnadze, to, gromyko, s, former, post, in, charge, of, foreign, policy, other, allies, whom, he, saw, promoted, were, yakovlev, anatoly, lukyanov, and, vadim, medvedev, another, of, those, promoted, by, gorbachev, was, boris, yeltsin, who, was, made, a, secretary, of, the, central, committee, 26th, term, in, july, 1985, most, of, these, appointees, were, from, a, new, generation, of, well, educated, officials, who, had, been, frustrated, during, the, brezhnev, era, in, his, first, year, 14, of, the, 23, heads, of, department, in, the, secretariat, were, replaced, doing, so, gorbachev, secured, dominance, in, the, politburo, within, a, year, faster, than, either, stalin, khrushchev, or, brezhnev, had, achieved, gorbachev, recurrently, employed, the, term, perestroika, first, used, publicly, in, march, 1984, he, saw, perestroika, as, encompassing, a, complex, series, of, reforms, to, restructure, society, and, the, economy, he, was, concerned, by, the, country, s, low, productivity, poor, work, ethic, and, inferior, quality, goods, like, several, economists, he, feared, this, would, lead, to, the, country, becoming, a, second, rate, power, the, first, stage, of, gorbachev, s, perestroika, was, uskoreniye, acceleration, a, term, he, used, regularly, in, the, first, two, years, of, his, leadership, the, soviet, union, was, behind, the, united, states, in, many, areas, of, production, but, gorbachev, claimed, that, it, would, accelerate, industrial, output, to, match, that, of, the, us, by, 2000, the, five, year, plan, of, 1985, 1990, was, targeted, to, expand, machine, building, by, 50, to, 100, to, boost, agricultural, productivity, he, merged, five, ministries, and, a, state, committee, into, a, single, entity, agroprom, although, by, late, 1986, he, acknowledged, this, merger, as, a, failure, the, purpose, of, reform, was, to, prop, up, the, centrally, planned, economy, not, to, transition, to, market, socialism, speaking, in, late, summer, 1985, to, the, secretaries, for, economic, affairs, of, the, central, committees, of, the, east, european, communist, parties, gorbachev, said, many, of, you, see, the, solution, to, your, problems, in, resorting, to, market, mechanisms, in, place, of, direct, planning, some, of, you, look, at, the, market, as, a, lifesaver, for, your, economies, but, comrades, you, should, not, think, about, lifesavers, but, about, the, ship, and, the, ship, is, socialism, gorbachev, s, perestroika, also, entailed, attempts, to, move, away, from, technocratic, management, of, the, economy, by, increasingly, involving, the, labor, force, in, industrial, production, he, was, of, the, view, that, once, freed, from, the, strong, control, of, central, planners, state, owned, enterprises, would, act, as, market, agents, gorbachev, and, other, soviet, leaders, did, not, anticipate, opposition, to, the, perestroika, reforms, according, to, their, interpretation, of, marxism, they, believed, that, in, a, socialist, society, like, the, soviet, union, there, would, not, be, antagonistic, contradictions, however, there, would, come, to, be, a, public, perception, in, the, country, that, many, bureaucrats, were, paying, lip, service, to, the, reforms, while, trying, to, undermine, them, he, also, initiated, the, concept, of, gospriyomka, state, acceptance, of, production, during, his, time, as, leader, which, represented, quality, control, in, april, 1986, he, introduced, an, agrarian, reform, which, linked, salaries, to, output, and, allowed, collective, farms, to, sell, 30, of, their, produce, directly, to, shops, or, co, operatives, rather, than, giving, it, all, to, the, state, for, distribution, in, a, september, 1986, speech, he, embraced, the, idea, of, reintroducing, market, economics, to, the, country, alongside, limited, private, enterprise, citing, lenin, s, new, economic, policy, as, a, precedent, he, nevertheless, stressed, that, he, did, not, regard, this, as, a, return, to, capitalism, in, the, soviet, union, alcohol, consumption, had, risen, steadily, between, 1950, and, 1985, by, the, 1980s, drunkenness, was, a, major, social, problem, and, andropov, had, planned, a, major, campaign, to, limit, alcohol, consumption, but, died, before, the, plan, was, put, into, action, encouraged, by, his, wife, gorbachev, who, believed, the, campaign, would, improve, health, and, work, efficiency, oversaw, its, implementation, alcohol, production, was, reduced, by, around, 40, the, legal, drinking, age, rose, from, 18, to, 21, alcohol, prices, were, increased, stores, were, banned, from, selling, it, before, 2, pm, and, tougher, penalties, were, introduced, for, workplace, or, public, drunkenness, and, home, production, of, alcohol, the, program, also, recommended, that, drinking, scenes, be, censored, from, old, movies, the, all, union, voluntary, society, for, the, struggle, for, temperance, was, formed, to, promote, sobriety, it, had, over, 14, million, members, within, three, years, anti, alcohol, propaganda, was, distributed, mostly, by, way, of, billboards, extolling, the, virtues, of, a, sober, workforce, as, a, result, crime, rates, fell, and, life, expectancy, grew, slightly, between, 1986, and, 1987, however, bootleg, liquor, production, rose, considerably, and, the, reform, imposed, large, costs, on, the, soviet, economy, namely, from, decreasing, tax, collections, from, declining, alcohol, sales, resulting, in, losses, of, up, to, us, 100, billion, between, 1985, and, 1990, another, serious, problem, was, the, strain, on, the, soviet, healthcare, system, as, uneducated, soviet, citizens, had, resorted, to, drinking, rubbing, alcohol, nail, polish, remover, or, cologne, as, dangerous, substitutes, resulting, in, a, rise, in, poisoning, cases, gorbachev, later, considered, the, campaign, to, have, been, an, error, and, it, was, terminated, in, october, 1988, after, it, ended, it, took, several, years, for, production, to, return, to, previous, levels, after, which, alcohol, consumption, soared, in, russia, between, 1990, and, 1993, in, the, second, year, of, his, leadership, gorbachev, began, speaking, of, glasnost, or, openness, according, to, doder, and, branson, this, meant, greater, openness, and, candour, in, government, affairs, and, for, an, interplay, of, different, and, sometimes, conflicting, views, in, political, debates, in, the, press, and, in, soviet, culture, encouraging, reformers, into, prominent, media, positions, he, brought, in, sergei, zalygin, as, head, of, novy, mir, magazine, and, yegor, yakovlev, as, editor, in, chief, of, moscow, news, he, made, the, historian, yury, afanasyev, dean, of, the, state, historical, archive, faculty, from, where, afansiev, could, press, for, the, opening, of, secret, archives, and, the, reassessment, of, soviet, history, prominent, dissidents, like, andrei, sakharov, were, freed, from, internal, exile, or, prison, gorbachev, saw, glasnost, as, a, necessary, measure, to, ensure, perestroika, by, alerting, the, soviet, populace, to, the, nature, of, the, country, s, problems, in, the, hope, that, they, would, support, his, efforts, to, fix, them, particularly, popular, among, the, soviet, intelligentsia, who, became, key, gorbachev, supporters, glasnost, boosted, his, domestic, popularity, but, alarmed, many, communist, party, hardliners, for, many, soviet, citizens, this, newfound, level, of, freedom, of, speech, and, press, and, its, accompanying, revelations, about, the, country, s, past, was, uncomfortable, some, in, the, party, thought, gorbachev, was, not, going, far, enough, in, his, reforms, a, prominent, liberal, critic, was, yeltsin, he, had, risen, rapidly, since, 1985, attaining, the, role, of, party, secretary, in, moscow, like, many, members, of, the, government, gorbachev, was, skeptical, of, yeltsin, believing, that, he, engaged, in, too, much, self, promotion, yeltsin, was, also, critical, of, gorbachev, regarding, him, as, patronizing, in, early, 1986, yeltsin, began, sniping, at, gorbachev, in, politburo, meetings, at, the, twenty, seventh, party, congress, in, february, yeltsin, called, for, more, far, reaching, reforms, than, gorbachev, was, initiating, and, criticized, the, party, leadership, although, he, did, not, cite, gorbachev, by, name, claiming, that, a, new, cult, of, personality, was, forming, gorbachev, then, opened, the, floor, to, responses, after, which, attendees, publicly, criticized, yeltsin, for, several, hours, after, this, gorbachev, also, criticized, yeltsin, claiming, that, he, cared, only, for, himself, and, was, politically, illiterate, yeltsin, then, resigned, both, as, moscow, party, secretary, and, as, a, member, of, the, politburo, from, this, point, tensions, between, the, two, men, developed, into, a, mutual, hatred, in, april, 1986, the, chernobyl, disaster, occurred, in, the, immediate, aftermath, officials, fed, gorbachev, incorrect, information, to, downplay, the, incident, as, the, scale, of, the, disaster, became, apparent, 336, 000, people, were, evacuated, from, the, area, around, chernobyl, taubman, noted, that, the, disaster, marked, a, turning, point, for, gorbachev, and, the, soviet, regime, several, days, after, it, occurred, he, gave, a, televised, report, to, the, nation, he, cited, the, disaster, as, evidence, for, what, he, regarded, as, widespread, problems, in, soviet, society, such, as, shoddy, workmanship, and, workplace, inertia, gorbachev, later, described, the, incident, as, one, which, made, him, appreciate, the, scale, of, incompetence, and, cover, ups, in, the, soviet, union, from, april, to, the, end, of, the, year, gorbachev, became, increasingly, open, in, his, criticism, of, the, soviet, system, including, food, production, state, bureaucracy, the, military, draft, and, the, large, size, of, the, prison, population, in, a, may, 1985, speech, given, to, the, soviet, foreign, ministry, the, first, time, a, soviet, leader, had, directly, addressed, his, country, s, diplomats, gorbachev, spoke, of, a, radical, restructuring, of, foreign, policy, a, major, issue, facing, his, leadership, was, soviet, involvement, in, the, afghan, civil, war, which, had, then, been, going, on, for, over, five, years, over, the, course, of, the, war, the, soviet, army, took, heavy, casualties, and, there, was, much, opposition, to, soviet, involvement, among, both, the, public, and, military, on, becoming, leader, gorbachev, saw, withdrawal, from, the, war, as, a, key, priority, in, october, 1985, he, met, with, afghan, marxist, leader, babrak, karmal, urging, him, to, acknowledge, the, lack, of, widespread, public, support, for, his, government, and, pursue, a, power, sharing, agreement, with, the, opposition, that, month, the, politburo, approved, gorbachev, s, decision, to, withdraw, combat, troops, from, afghanistan, although, the, last, troops, did, not, leave, until, february, 1989, gorbachev, had, inherited, a, renewed, period, of, high, tension, in, the, cold, war, he, believed, strongly, in, the, need, to, sharply, improve, relations, with, the, united, states, he, was, appalled, at, the, prospect, of, nuclear, war, was, aware, that, the, soviet, union, was, unlikely, to, win, the, arms, race, and, thought, that, the, continued, focus, on, high, military, spending, was, detrimental, to, his, desire, for, domestic, reform, us, president, ronald, reagan, publicly, appeared, to, not, want, a, de, escalation, of, tensions, having, scrapped, d, tente, and, arms, controls, initiating, a, military, build, up, and, calling, the, soviet, union, the, evil, empire, both, gorbachev, and, reagan, wanted, a, summit, to, discuss, the, cold, war, but, each, faced, some, opposition, to, such, a, move, within, their, respective, governments, they, agreed, to, hold, a, summit, in, geneva, switzerland, in, november, 1985, in, the, buildup, to, this, gorbachev, sought, to, improve, relations, with, the, us, s, nato, allies, visiting, france, in, october, 1985, to, meet, with, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, at, the, geneva, summit, discussions, between, gorbachev, and, reagan, were, sometimes, heated, and, gorbachev, was, initially, frustrated, that, his, us, counterpart, does, not, seem, to, hear, what, i, am, trying, to, say, as, well, as, discussing, the, cold, war, proxy, conflicts, in, afghanistan, and, nicaragua, and, human, rights, issues, the, pair, discussed, the, us, s, strategic, defense, initiative, sdi, to, which, gorbachev, was, strongly, opposed, the, duo, s, wives, also, met, and, spent, time, together, at, the, summit, the, summit, ended, with, a, joint, commitment, to, avoiding, nuclear, war, and, to, meet, for, two, further, summits, in, washington, dc, in, 1986, and, in, moscow, in, 1987, following, the, conference, gorbachev, traveled, to, prague, to, inform, other, warsaw, pact, leaders, of, developments, in, january, 1986, gorbachev, publicly, proposed, a, three, stage, programme, for, abolishing, the, world, s, nuclear, weapons, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, an, agreement, was, then, reached, to, meet, with, reagan, in, reykjav, k, iceland, in, october, 1986, gorbachev, wanted, to, secure, guarantees, that, sdi, would, not, be, implemented, and, in, return, was, willing, to, offer, concessions, including, a, 50, reduction, in, soviet, long, range, nuclear, missiles, both, leaders, agreed, with, the, shared, goal, of, abolishing, nuclear, weapons, but, gorbachev, ultimately, thought, that, too, out, of, reach, and, instead, proposed, a, mutual, elimination, of, all, medium, range, nuclear, missiles, reagan, refused, to, terminate, the, sdi, program, and, no, deal, was, reached, after, the, summit, many, of, reagan, s, allies, criticized, him, for, going, along, with, the, idea, of, abolishing, nuclear, weapons, gorbachev, meanwhile, told, the, politburo, that, reagan, was, extraordinarily, primitive, troglodyte, and, intellectually, feeble, in, his, relations, with, the, developing, world, gorbachev, found, many, of, its, leaders, professing, revolutionary, socialist, credentials, or, a, pro, soviet, attitude, such, as, libya, s, muammar, gaddafi, and, syria, s, hafez, al, assad, frustrating, and, his, best, personal, relationship, was, instead, with, india, s, prime, minister, rajiv, gandhi, he, thought, that, the, socialist, camp, of, marxist, leninist, governed, states, the, eastern, bloc, countries, north, korea, vietnam, and, cuba, were, a, drain, on, the, soviet, economy, receiving, a, far, greater, amount, of, goods, from, the, soviet, union, than, they, collectively, gave, in, return, he, sought, improved, relations, with, china, a, country, whose, marxist, government, had, severed, ties, with, the, soviets, in, the, sino, soviet, split, and, had, since, undergone, its, own, structural, reform, in, june, 1985, he, signed, a, us, 14, billion, five, year, trade, agreement, with, the, country, and, in, july, 1986, he, proposed, troop, reductions, along, the, soviet, chinese, border, hailing, china, as, a, great, socialist, country, he, made, clear, his, desire, for, soviet, membership, of, the, asian, development, bank, and, for, greater, ties, to, pacific, countries, especially, china, and, japan, in, january, 1987, gorbachev, attended, a, central, committee, plenum, where, he, talked, about, perestroika, and, democratization, while, criticizing, widespread, corruption, he, considered, putting, a, proposal, to, allow, multi, party, elections, into, his, speech, but, decided, against, doing, so, after, the, plenum, he, focused, his, attentions, on, economic, reform, holding, discussions, with, government, officials, and, economists, many, economists, proposed, reducing, ministerial, controls, on, the, economy, and, allowing, state, owned, enterprises, to, set, their, own, targets, ryzhkov, and, other, government, figures, were, skeptical, in, june, gorbachev, finished, his, report, on, economic, reform, it, reflected, a, compromise, ministers, would, retain, the, ability, to, set, output, targets, but, these, would, not, be, considered, binding, that, month, a, plenum, accepted, his, recommendations, and, the, supreme, soviet, passed, a, law, on, enterprises, implementing, the, changes, economic, problems, remained, by, the, late, 1980s, there, were, still, widespread, shortages, of, basic, goods, rising, inflation, and, declining, living, standards, these, stoked, a, number, of, miners, strikes, in, 1989, by, 1987, the, ethos, of, glasnost, had, spread, through, soviet, society, journalists, were, writing, increasingly, openly, many, economic, problems, were, being, publicly, revealed, and, studies, appeared, that, critically, reassessed, soviet, history, gorbachev, was, broadly, supportive, describing, glasnost, as, the, crucial, irreplaceable, weapon, of, perestroika, he, nevertheless, insisted, that, people, should, use, the, newfound, freedom, responsibly, stating, that, journalists, and, writers, should, avoid, sensationalism, and, be, completely, objective, in, their, reporting, nearly, two, hundred, previously, restricted, soviet, films, were, publicly, released, and, a, range, of, western, films, were, also, made, available, in, 1989, soviet, responsibility, for, the, 1940, katyn, massacre, was, finally, revealed, in, september, 1987, the, government, stopped, jamming, the, signal, of, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, and, voice, of, america, the, reforms, also, included, greater, tolerance, of, religion, an, easter, service, was, broadcast, on, soviet, television, for, the, first, time, and, the, millennium, celebrations, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, were, given, media, attention, independent, organizations, appeared, most, supportive, of, gorbachev, although, the, largest, pamyat, was, ultra, nationalist, and, antisemitic, in, nature, gorbachev, also, announced, that, soviet, jews, wishing, to, migrate, to, israel, would, be, allowed, to, do, so, something, previously, prohibited, in, august, 1987, gorbachev, holidayed, in, nizhnyaya, oreanda, in, oreanda, crimea, there, writing, perestroika, new, thinking, for, our, country, and, our, world, at, the, suggestion, of, us, publishers, for, the, 70th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, which, brought, lenin, and, the, communist, party, to, power, gorbachev, produced, a, speech, on, october, and, perestroika, the, revolution, continues, delivered, to, a, ceremonial, joint, session, of, the, central, committee, and, the, supreme, soviet, in, the, kremlin, palace, of, congresses, it, praised, lenin, but, criticized, stalin, for, overseeing, mass, human, rights, abuses, party, hardliners, thought, the, speech, went, too, far, liberalisers, thought, it, did, not, go, far, enough, in, march, 1988, the, magazine, sovetskaya, rossiya, published, an, open, letter, by, the, teacher, nina, andreyeva, it, criticized, elements, of, gorbachev, s, reforms, attacking, what, she, regarded, as, the, denigration, of, the, stalinist, era, and, arguing, that, a, reformer, clique, whom, she, implied, were, mostly, jews, and, ethnic, minorities, were, to, blame, over, 900, soviet, newspapers, reprinted, it, and, anti, reformists, rallied, around, it, many, reformers, panicked, fearing, a, backlash, against, perestroika, on, returning, from, yugoslavia, gorbachev, called, a, politburo, meeting, to, discuss, the, letter, at, which, he, confronted, those, hardliners, supporting, its, sentiment, ultimately, the, politburo, arrived, at, a, unanimous, decision, to, express, disapproval, of, andreyeva, s, letter, and, publish, a, rebuttal, in, pravda, yakovlev, and, gorbachev, s, rebuttal, claimed, that, those, who, look, everywhere, for, internal, enemies, were, not, patriots, and, presented, stalin, s, guilt, for, massive, repressions, and, lawlessness, as, enormous, and, unforgiveable, although, the, next, party, congress, was, not, scheduled, until, 1991, gorbachev, convened, the, 19th, party, conference, in, its, place, in, june, 1988, he, hoped, that, by, allowing, a, broader, range, of, people, to, attend, than, at, previous, conferences, he, would, gain, additional, support, for, his, reforms, with, sympathetic, officials, and, academics, gorbachev, drafted, plans, for, reforms, that, would, shift, power, away, from, the, politburo, and, towards, the, soviets, while, the, soviets, had, become, largely, powerless, bodies, that, rubber, stamped, politburo, policies, he, wanted, them, to, become, year, round, legislatures, he, proposed, the, formation, of, a, new, institution, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, whose, members, were, to, be, elected, in, a, largely, free, vote, this, congress, would, in, turn, elect, a, ussr, supreme, soviet, which, would, do, most, of, the, legislating, these, proposals, reflected, gorbachev, s, desire, for, more, democracy, however, in, his, view, there, was, a, major, impediment, in, that, the, soviet, people, had, developed, a, slave, psychology, after, centuries, of, tsarist, autocracy, and, marxist, leninist, authoritarianism, held, at, the, kremlin, palace, of, congresses, the, conference, brought, together, 5, 000, delegates, and, featured, arguments, between, hardliners, and, liberalisers, the,

streamlining, the, party, apparatus, the, central, committee, staff, which, then, numbered, around, 3, 000, was, halved, while, various, central, committee, departments, were, merged, to, cut, down,

hundred, by, the, press, were, directly, chosen, by, the, communist, party, with, gorbachev, ensuring, many, were, reformists, although, over, 85, of, elected, deputies, were, party, members, many, of, those, elected, including, sakharov, and, yeltsin, were, liberalisers, gorbachev, was, happy, with, the, result, describing, it, as, an, enormous, political, victory, under, extraordinarily, difficult, circumstances, the, new, congress, convened, in, may, 1989, gorbachev, was, then, elected, its, chair, the, new, de, facto, head, of, state, with, 2, 123, votes, in, favor, to, 87, against, its, sessions, were, televised, live, and, its, members, elected, the, new, supreme, soviet, at, the, congress, sakharov, spoke, repeatedly, exasperating, gorbachev, with, his, calls, for, greater, liberalization, and, the, introduction, of, private, property, when, sakharov, died, shortly, after, yeltsin, became, the, figurehead, of, the, liberal, opposition, gorbachev, tried, to, improve, relations, with, the, uk, france, and, west, germany, like, previous, soviet, leaders, he, was, interested, in, pulling, western, europe, away, from, us, influence, calling, for, greater, pan, european, co, operation, he, publicly, spoke, of, a, common, european, home, and, of, a, europe, from, the, atlantic, to, the, urals, in, march, 1987, thatcher, visited, gorbachev, in, moscow,

november, 1988, mitterrand, visited, him, in, moscow, the, west, german, chancellor, helmut, kohl, had, initially, offended, gorbachev, by, comparing, him, to, nazi, propagandist, joseph, goebbels, although, he, later, informally, apologized, and, in, october, 1988, visited, moscow, in, june, 1989, gorbachev, then, visited, kohl, in, west, germany, in, november, 1989, he, also, visited, italy, meeting, with, pope, john, paul, ii, gorbachev, s, relationships, with, these, west, european, leaders, were, typically, far, warmer, than, those, he, had, with, their, eastern, bloc, counterparts,

gorbachev, s, belief, in, economic, reform, but, rejected, calls, for, democratization, pro, democracy, students, had, massed, in, tiananmen, square, during, gorbachev, s, visit, but, after, he, left, were, massacred, by, troops, gorbachev, did, not, condemn, the, massacre, publicly, but, it, reinforced, his, commitment, not, to, use, violent, force, in, dealing, with, pro, democracy, protests, in, the, eastern, bloc, following, the, failures, of, earlier, talks, with, the, us, in, february, 1987, gorbachev, held, a, conference, in, moscow, titled, for, a, world, without, nuclear, weapons, for, mankind, s, survival, which, was, attended, by, various, international, celebrities, and, politicians, by, publicly, pushing, for, nuclear, disarmament, gorbachev, sought, to, give, the, soviet, union, the, moral, high, ground, and, weaken, the, west, s, self, perception, of, moral, superiority, aware, that, reagan, would, not, budge, on, sdi, gorbachev, focused, on, reducing, intermediate, range, nuclear, forces, to, which, reagan, was, receptive, in, april, 1987, gorbachev, discussed, the, issue, with, us, secretary, of, state, george, p, shultz, in, moscow, he, agreed, to, eliminate, the, soviets, ss, 23, rockets, and, allow, us, inspectors, to, visit, soviet, military, facilities, to, ensure, compliance, there, was, hostility, to, such, compromises, from, the, soviet, military, but, following, the, may, 1987, mathias, rust, incident, in, which, a, west, german, teenager, was, able, to, fly, undetected, from, finland, and, land, in, red, square, gorbachev, fired, many, senior, military, figures, for, incompetence, in, december, 1987, gorbachev, visited, washington, dc, where, he, and, reagan, signed, the, intermediate, range, nuclear, forces, treaty, taubman, called, it, one, of, the, highest, points, of, gorbachev, s, career, a, second, us, soviet, summit, occurred, in, moscow, in, may, june, 1988, which, gorbachev, expected, to, be, largely, symbolic, again, he, and, reagan, criticized, each, other, s, countries, reagan, raising, soviet, restrictions, on, religious, freedom, gorbachev, highlighting, poverty, and, racial, discrimination, in, the, us, but, gorbachev, related, that, they, spoke, on, friendly, terms, they, reached, an, agreement, on, notifying, each, other, before, conducting, ballistic, missile, tests, and, made, agreements, on, transport, fishing, and, radio, navigation, at, the, summit, reagan, told, reporters, that, he, no, longer, considered, the, soviet, union, an, evil, empire, and, the, two, revealed, that, they, considered, themselves, friends, the, third, summit, was, held, in, new, york, city, in, december, arriving, there, gorbachev, gave, a, speech, to, the, united, nations, general, assembly, where, he,

president, bush, appeared, interested, in, continuing, talks, with, gorbachev, but, wanted, to, appear, tougher, on, the, soviets, than, reagan, and, had, to, allay, criticism, from, the, right, wing, of, his, republican, party, in, december, 1989, gorbachev, and, bush, met, at, the, malta, summit, bush, offered, to, assist, the, soviet, economy, by, suspending, the, jackson, vanik, amendment, and, repealing, the, stevenson, and, baird, amendments, there, they, agreed, to, a, joint, press, conference, the, first, time, that, a, us, and, soviet, leader, had, done, so, gorbachev, also, urged, bush, to, normalize, relations, with, cuba, and, meet, its, president, fidel, castro, although, bush, refused, to, do, so, on, taking, power, gorbachev, found, some, unrest, among, different, national, groups, within, the, soviet, union, in, december, 1986, riots, broke, out, in, several, kazakh, cities, after, a, russian, was, appointed, head, of, the, region, in, 1987, crimean, tatars, protested, in, moscow, to, demand, resettlement, in, crimea, the, area, from, which, they, had, been, deported, on, stalin, s, orders, in, 1944, gorbachev, ordered, a, commission, headed, by, gromyko, to, examine, their, situation, gromyko, s, report, opposed, calls, for, assisting, tatar, resettlement, in, crimea, by, 1988, the, soviet, nationality, question, was, increasingly, pressing, in, february, the, administration, of, the, nagorno, karabakh, autonomous, oblast, officially, requested, that, it, be, transferred, from, the, azerbaijan, soviet, socialist, republic, to, the, armenian, soviet, socialist, republic, the, majority, of, the, region, s, population, were, ethnically, armenian, and, wanted, unification, with, other, majority, armenian, areas, as, rival, armenian, and, azerbaijani, demonstrations, took, place, in, nagorno, karabakh, gorbachev, called, an, emergency, meeting, of, the, politburo, gorbachev, promised, greater, autonomy, for, nagorno, karabakh, but, refused, the, transfer, fearing, that, it, would, set, off, similar, ethnic, tensions, and, demands, throughout, the, soviet, union, in, the, end, however, greater, autonomy, was, never, given, and, instead, gorbachev, ordered, the, further, violent, ethnic, cleansing, of, armenians, in, parts, of, nagorno, karabakh, and, the, adjacent, armenian, populated, shahumyan, region, in, what, was, named, operation, ring, that, month, in, the, azerbaijani, city, of, sumgait, azerbaijani, gangs, began, killing, members, of, the, armenian, minority, local, troops, tried, to, quell, the, unrest, but, were, attacked, by, mobs, the, politburo, ordered, additional, troops, into, the, city, but, in, contrast, to, those, like, ligachev, who, wanted, a, massive, display, of, force, gorbachev, urged, restraint, he, believed, that, the, situation, could, be, resolved, through, a, political, solution, urging, talks, between, the, armenian, and, azerbaijani, communist, parties, further, anti, armenian, violence, broke, out, in, baku, in, january, 1990, followed, by, the, soviet, army, killing, about, 150, azeris, problems, also, emerged, in, the, georgian, soviet, socialist, republic, in, april, 1989, soviet, troops, crushed, georgian, pro, independence, demonstrations, in, tbilisi, resulting, in, various, deaths, independence, sentiment, was, also, rising, in, the, baltic, states, the, supreme, soviets, of, the, estonian, lithuanian, and, latvian, soviet, socialist, republics, declared, their, economic, autonomy, from, the, soviet, central, government, and, introduced, measures, to, restrict, russian, immigration, in, august, 1989, protesters, formed, the, baltic, way, a, human, chain, across, the, three, countries, to, symbolize, their, wish, to, restore, independence, that, month, the, lithuanian, supreme, soviet, ruled, the, 1940, soviet, annexation, of, their, country, to, be, illegal, in, january, 1990, gorbachev, visited, the, republic, to, encourage, it, to, remain, part, of, the, soviet, union, gorbachev, rejected, the, brezhnev, doctrine, the, idea, that, the, soviet, union, had, the, right, to, intervene, militarily, in, other, marxist, leninist, countries, if, their, governments, were, threatened, in, december, 1987, he, announced, the, withdrawal, of, 500, 000, soviet, troops, from, central, and, eastern, europe, while, pursuing, domestic, reforms, he, did, not, publicly, support, reformers, elsewhere, in, the, eastern, bloc, hoping, instead, to, lead, by, example, he, later, related, that, he, did, not, want, to, interfere, in, their, internal, affairs, but, he, may, have, feared, that, pushing, reform, in, central, and, eastern, europe, would, have, angered, his, own, hardliners, too, much, some, eastern, bloc, leaders, like, hungary, s, j, nos, k, d, r, and, poland, s, wojciech, jaruzelski, were, sympathetic, to, reform, others, like, romania, s, nicolae, ceau, escu, were, hostile, to, it, in, may, 1987, gorbachev, visited, romania, where, he, was, appalled, by, the, state, of, the, country, later, telling, the, politburo, that, there, human, dignity, has, absolutely, no, value, he, and, ceau, escu, disliked, each, other, and, argued, over, gorbachev, s, reforms, in, august, 1989, the, pan, european, picnic, which, otto, von, habsburg, planned, as, a, test, of, gorbachev, resulted, in, a, large, mass, exodus, of, east, german, refugees, according, to, the, sinatra, doctrine, the, soviet, union, did, not, interfere, and, the, media, informed, eastern, european, population, realized, that, on, the, one, hand, their, rulers, were, increasingly, losing, power, and, on, the, other, hand, the, iron, curtain, was, falling, apart, as, a, bracket, for, the, eastern, bloc, in, the, revolutions, of, 1989, most, of, the, marxist, leninist, states, of, central, and, eastern, europe, held, multi, party, elections, resulting, in, regime, change, in, most, countries, like, poland, and, hungary, this, was, achieved, peacefully, but, in, romania, the, revolution, turned, violent, and, led, to, ceau, escu, s, overthrow, and, execution, gorbachev, was, too, preoccupied, with, domestic, problems, to, pay, much, attention, to, these, events, he, believed, that, democratic, elections, would, not, lead, eastern, european, countries, into, abandoning, their, commitment, to, socialism, in, 1989, he, visited, east, germany, for, the, fortieth, anniversary, of, its, founding, shortly, after, in, november, the, east, german, government, allowed, its, citizens, to, cross, the, berlin, wall, a, decision, gorbachev, praised, over, the, following, years, much, of, the, wall, was, demolished, neither, gorbachev, nor, thatcher, or, mitterrand, wanted, a, swift, reunification, of, germany, aware, that, it, would, likely, become, the, dominant, european, power, gorbachev, wanted, a, gradual, process, of, german, integration, but, kohl, began, calling, for, rapid, reunification, with, german, reunification, in, 1990, many, observers, declared, the, cold, war, over, in, february, 1990, both, liberalisers, and, marxist, leninist, hardliners, intensified, their, attacks, on, gorbachev, a, liberalizer, march, took, place, in, moscow, criticizing, communist, party, rule, while, at, a, central, committee, meeting, the, hardliner, vladimir, brovikov, accused, gorbachev, of, reducing, the, country, to, anarchy, and, ruin, and, of, pursuing, western, approval, at, the, expense, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, marxist, leninist, cause, gorbachev, was, aware, that, the, central, committee, could, still, oust, him, as, general, secretary, and, so, decided, to, reformulate, the, role, of, head, of, government, to, a, presidency, from, which, he, could, not, be, removed, he, decided, that, the, presidential, election, should, be, held, by, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, he, chose, this, over, a, public, vote, because, he, thought, the, latter, would, escalate, tensions, and, feared, that, he, might, lose, it, a, spring, 1990, poll, nevertheless, still, showed, him, as, the, most, popular, politician, in, the, country, in, march, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, held, the, first, and, only, soviet, presidential, election, in, which, gorbachev, was, the, only, candidate, he, secured, 1, 329, in, favor, to, 495, against, 313, votes, were, invalid, or, absent, he, therefore, became, the, first, and, only, executive, president, of, the, soviet, union, a, new, 18, member, presidential, council, de, facto, replaced, the, politburo, at, the, same, congress, meeting, he, presented, the, idea, of, repealing, article, 6, of, the, soviet, constitution, which, had, ratified, the, communist, party, as, the, ruling, party, of, the, soviet, union, the, congress, passed, the, reform, undermining, the, de, jure, nature, of, the, one, party, state, in, the, 1990, elections, for, the, russian, supreme, soviet, the, communist, party, faced, challengers, from, an, alliance, of, liberalisers, known, as, democratic, russia, the, latter, did, particularly, well, in, urban, centers, yeltsin, was, elected, the, parliament, s, chair, something, gorbachev, was, unhappy, about, that, year, opinion, polls, showed, yeltsin, overtaking, gorbachev, as, the, most, popular, politician, in, the, soviet, union, gorbachev, struggled, to, understand, yeltsin, s, growing, popularity, commenting, he, drinks, like, a, fish, he, s, inarticulate, he, comes, up, with, the, devil, knows, what, he, s, like, a, worn, out, record, the, russian, supreme, soviet, was, now, out, of, gorbachev, s, control, in, june, 1990, it, declared, that, in, the, russian, republic, its, laws, took, precedence, over, those, of, the, soviet, central, government, amid, a, growth, in, russian, nationalist, sentiment, gorbachev, had, reluctantly, allowed, the, formation, of, a, communist, party, of, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, as, a, branch, of, the, larger, soviet, communist, party, gorbachev, attended, its, first, congress, in, june, but, soon, found, it, dominated, by, hardliners, who, opposed, his, reformist, stance, in, january, 1990, gorbachev, privately, agreed, to, permit, east, german, reunification, with, west, germany, but, rejected, the, idea, that, a, unified, germany, could, retain, west, germany, s, nato, membership, his, compromise, that, germany, might, retain, both, nato, and, warsaw, pact, memberships, did, not, attract, support, on, 9, february, 1990, in, a, phone, conversation, with, james, baker, then, the, us, secretary, of, state, he, set, out, his, position, that, a, broadening, of, the, nato, zone, is, not, acceptable, to, which, baker, agreed, scholars, are, puzzled, why, gorbachev, never, pursued, a, written, pledge, in, may, 1990, he, visited, the, us, for, talks, with, president, bush, there, he, agreed, that, an, independent, germany, would, have, the, right, to, choose, its, international, alliances, ultimately, he, acquiesced, to, the, reunification, on, the, condition, that, nato, troops, not, be, posted, to, the, territory, of, eastern, germany, there, remains, some, confusion, over, whether, us, secretary, of, state, james, baker, led, gorbachev, to, believe, that, nato, would, not, expand, into, other, countries, in, eastern, europe, as, well, there, was, no, oral, or, written, us, promise, that, explicitly, said, so, gorbachev, himself, has, stated, that, he, was, only, made, such, a, promise, regarding, east, germany, and, that, it, was, kept, in, july, kohl, visited, moscow, and, gorbachev, informed, him, that, the, soviets, would, not, oppose, a, reunified, germany, being, part, of, nato, domestically, gorbachev, s, critics, accused, him, of, betraying, the, national, interest, more, broadly, they, were, angry, that, gorbachev, had, allowed, the, eastern, bloc, to, move, away, from, direct, soviet, influence, in, august, 1990, saddam, hussein, s, iraqi, government, invaded, kuwait, gorbachev, endorsed, president, bush, s, condemnation, of, it, this, brought, criticism, from, many, in, the, soviet, state, apparatus, who, saw, hussein, as, a, key, ally, in, the, persian, gulf, and, feared, for, the, safety, of, the, 9, 000, soviet, citizens, in, iraq, although, gorbachev, argued, that, the, iraqis, were, the, clear, aggressors, in, the, situation, in, november, the, soviets, endorsed, a, un, resolution, permitting, force, to, be, used, in, expelling, the, iraqi, army, from, kuwait, gorbachev, later, called, it, a, watershed, in, world, politics, the, first, time, the, superpowers, acted, together, in, a, regional, crisis, however, when, the, us, announced, plans, for, a, ground, invasion, gorbachev, opposed, it, urging, instead, a, peaceful, solution, in, october, 1990, gorbachev, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, he, was, flattered, but, acknowledged, mixed, feelings, about, the, accolade, polls, indicated, that, 90, of, soviet, citizens, disapproved, of, the, award, which, was, widely, seen, as, a, western, and, anti, soviet, accolade, with, the, soviet, budget, deficit, climbing, and, no, domestic, money, markets, to, provide, the, state, with, loans, gorbachev, looked, elsewhere, throughout, 1991, gorbachev, requested, sizable, loans, from, western, countries, and, japan, hoping, to, keep, the, soviet, economy, afloat, and, ensure, the, success, of, perestroika, although, the, soviet, union, had, been, excluded, from, the, g7, gorbachev, secured, an, invitation, to, its, london, summit, in, july, 1991, there, he, continued, to, call, for, financial, assistance, mitterrand, and, kohl, backed, him, while, thatcher, no, longer, in, office, also, urged, western, leaders, to, agree, most, g7, members, were, reluctant, instead, offering, technical, assistance, and, proposing, the, soviets, receive, special, associate, status, rather, than, full, membership, of, the, world, bank, and, international, monetary, fund, gorbachev, was, frustrated, that, the, us, would, spend, 100, billion, on, the, gulf, war, but, would, not, offer, his, country, loans, other, countries, were, more, forthcoming, west, germany, had, given, the, soviets, dm, 60, billion, by, mid, 1991, bush, visited, moscow, in, late, july, when, he, and, gorbachev, concluded, ten, years, of, negotiations, by, signing, the, start, i, treaty, a, bilateral, agreement, on, the, reduction, and, limitation, of, strategic, offensive, arms, at, the, 28th, communist, party, congress, in, july, 1990, hardliners, criticized, the, reformists, but, gorbachev, was, re, elected, party, leader, with, the, support, of, three, quarters, of, delegates, and, his, choice, of, deputy, general, secretary, vladimir, ivashko, was, also, elected, seeking, compromise, with, the, liberalizers, gorbachev, assembled, a, team, of, both, his, own, and, yeltsin, s, advisers, to, come, up, with, an, economic, reform, package, the, result, was, the, 500, days, programme, this, called, for, further, decentralization, and, some, privatization, gorbachev, described, the, plan, as, modern, socialism, rather, than, a, return, to, capitalism, but, had, many, doubts, about, it, in, september, yeltsin, presented, the, plan, to, the, russian, supreme, soviet, which, backed, it, many, in, the, communist, party, and, state, apparatus, warned, against, it, arguing, that, it, would, create, marketplace, chaos, rampant, inflation, and, unprecedented, levels, of, unemployment, the, 500, days, plan, was, abandoned, at, this, yeltsin, railed, against, gorbachev, in, an, october, speech, claiming, that, russia, would, no, longer, accept, a, subordinate, position, to, the, soviet, government, by, mid, november, 1990, much, of, the, press, was, calling, for, gorbachev, to, resign, and, predicting, civil, war, hardliners, were, urging, gorbachev, to, disband, the, presidential,

the, communist, party, of, the, russian, federation, candidate, whom, yeltsin, saw, as, a, stalinist, hardliner, he, never, expected, to, win, outright, but, thought, a, centrist, bloc, could, be,

gorbachev, s, close, friend, journalist, alexei, venediktov, said, that, gorbachev, was, very, upset, when, he, found, out, that, putin, had, launched, a, full, scale, invasion, of, ukraine, according, to, venediktov, gorbachev, believed, that, putin, destroyed, his, life, s, work, gorbachev, s, interpreter, pavel, palazhchenko, also, stated, that, gorbachev, was, psychologically, traumatized, by, the, invasion, in, the, months, preceding, his, death, even, before, he, left, office, gorbachev, had, become, a, kind, of, social, democrat, believing, in, as, he, later, put, it, equality, of, opportunity, publicly, supported, education, and, medical, care, a, guaranteed, minimum, of, social, welfare, and, a, socially, oriented, market, economy, all, within, a, democratic, political, framework, exactly, when, this, transformation, occurred, is, hard, to, say, but, surely, by, 1989, or, 1990, it, had, taken, place, gorbachev, biographer, william, taubman, 2017, according, to, his, university, friend, zden, k, mlyn, in, the, early, 1950s, gorbachev, like, everyone, else, at, the, time, was, a, stalinist, mlyn, noted, however, that, unlike, most, other, soviet, students, gorbachev, did, not, view, marxism, simply, as, a, collection, of, axioms, to, be, committed, to, memory, biographers, doder, and, branson, related, that, after, stalin, s, death, gorbachev, s, ideology, would, never, be, doctrinal, again, but, noted, that, he, remained, a, true, believer, in, the, soviet, system, doder, and, branson, noted, that, at, the, twenty, seventh, party, congress, in, 1986, gorbachev, was, seen, to, be, an, orthodox, marxist, leninist, that, year, the, biographer, zhores, medvedev, stated, that, gorbachev, is, neither, a, liberal, nor, a, bold, reformist, by, the, mid, 1980s, when, gorbachev, took, power, many, analysts, were, arguing, that, the, soviet, union, was, declining, to, the, status, of, a, third, world, country, in, this, context, gorbachev, argued, that, the, communist, party, had, to, adapt, and, engage, in, creative, thinking, much, as, lenin, had, creatively, interpreted, and, adapted, the, writings, of, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, to, the, situation, of, early, 20th, century, russia, for, instance, he, thought, that, rhetoric, about, global, revolution, and, overthrowing, the, bourgeoisie, which, had, been, integral, to, leninist, politics, had, become, too, dangerous, in, an, era, where, nuclear, warfare, could, obliterate, humanity, he, began, to, move, away, from, the, marxist, leninist, belief, in, class, struggle, as, the, engine, of, political, change, instead, viewing, politics, as, a, way, of, coordinating, the, interests, of, all, classes, however, as, gooding, noted, the, changes, that, gorbachev, proposed, were, expressed, wholly, within, the, terms, of, marxist, leninist, ideology, according, to, doder, and, branson, gorbachev, also, wanted, to, dismantle, the, hierarchical, military, society, at, home, and, abandon, the, grand, style, costly, imperialism, abroad, however, jonathan, steele, argued, that, gorbachev, failed, to, appreciate, why, the, baltic, nations, wanted, independence, and, at, heart, he, was, and, remains, a, russian, imperialist, gooding, thought, that, gorbachev, was, committed, to, democracy, something, marking, him, out, as, different, from, his, predecessors, gooding, also, suggested, that, when, in, power, gorbachev, came, to, see, socialism, not, as, a, place, on, the, path, to, communism, but, a, destination, in, itself, gorbachev, s, political, outlook, was, shaped, by, the, 23, years, he, served, as, a, party, official, in, stavropol, doder, and, branson, thought, that, throughout, most, of, his, political, career, prior, to, becoming, general, secretary, his, publicly, expressed, views, almost, certainly, reflected, a, politician, s, understanding, of, what, should, be, said, rather, than, his, personal, philosophy, otherwise, he, could, not, have, survived, politically, like, many, russians, gorbachev, sometimes, thought, of, the, soviet, union, as, being, largely, synonymous, with, russia, and, in, various, speeches, described, it, as, russia, in, one, incident, he, had, to, correct, himself, after, calling, the, ussr, russia, while, giving, a, speech, in, kiev, mccauley, noted, that, perestroika, was, an, elusive, concept, one, which, evolved, and, eventually, meant, something, radically, different, over, time, mccauley, stated, that, the, concept, originally, referred, to, radical, reform, of, the, economic, and, political, system, as, part, of, gorbachev, s, attempt, to, motivate, the, labor, force, and, make, management, more, effective, it, was, only, after, initial, measures, to, achieve, this, proved, unsuccessful, that, gorbachev, began, to, consider, market, mechanisms, and, co, operatives, albeit, with, the, state, sector, remaining, dominant, the, political, scientist, john, gooding, suggested, that, had, the, perestroika, reforms, succeeded, the, soviet, union, would, have, exchanged, totalitarian, controls, for, milder, authoritarian, ones, although, not, become, democratic, in, the, western, sense, with, perestroika, gorbachev, had, wanted, to, improve, the, existing, marxist, leninist, system, but, ultimately, ended, up, destroying, it, in, this, he, brought, an, end, to, state, socialism, in, the, soviet, union, and, paved, the, way, for, a, transition, to, liberal, democracy, taubman, nevertheless, thought, gorbachev, remained, a, socialist, he, described, gorbachev, as, a, true, believer, not, in, the, soviet, system, as, it, functioned, or, didn, t, in, 1985, but, in, its, potential, to, live, up, to, what, he, deemed, its, original, ideals, he, added, that, until, the, end, gorbachev, reiterated, his, belief, in, socialism, insisting, that, it, wasn, t, worthy, of, the, name, unless, it, was, truly, democratic, as, soviet, leader, gorbachev, believed, in, incremental, reform, rather, than, a, radical, transformation, he, later, referred, to, this, as, a, revolution, by, evolutionary, means, doder, and, branson, noted, that, over, the, course, of, the, 1980s, his, thought, underwent, a, radical, evolution, taubman, noted, that, by, 1989, or, 1990, gorbachev, had, transformed, into, a, social, democrat, mccauley, suggested, that, by, at, least, june, 1991, gorbachev, was, a, post, leninist, having, liberated, himself, from, marxism, leninism, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, the, newly, formed, communist, party, of, the, russian, federation, would, have, nothing, to, do, with, him, however, in, 2006, he, expressed, his, continued, belief, in, lenin, s, ideas, i, trusted, him, then, and, i, still, do, he, claimed, that, the, essence, of, lenin, was, a, desire, to, develop, the, living, creative, activity, of, the, masses, taubman, believed, that, gorbachev, identified, with, lenin, on, a, psychological, level, by, 1955, gorbachev, s, hair, was, thinning, and, by, the, late, 1960s, he, was, bald, revealing, a, distinctive, port, wine, stain, on, the, top, of, his, head, gorbachev, reached, an, adult, height, of, 5, foot, 9, inches, 1, 75, m, throughout, the, 1960s, he, struggled, against, obesity, and, dieted, to, control, the, problem, doder, and, branson, characterized, him, as, stocky, but, not, fat, he, spoke, in, a, southern, russian, accent, and, was, known, to, sing, both, folk, and, pop, songs, throughout, his, life, he, tried, to, dress, fashionably, having, an, aversion, to, hard, liquor, he, drank, sparingly, and, did, not, smoke, he, was, protective, of, his, private, life, and, avoided, inviting, people, to, his, home, gorbachev, cherished, his, wife, who, in, turn, was, protective, of, him, he, was, an, involved, parent, and, grandparent, he, sent, his, daughter, his, only, child, to, a, local, school, in, stavropol, rather, than, to, a, school, set, aside, for, the, children, of, party, elites, unlike, many, of, his, contemporaries, in, the, soviet, administration, he, was, not, a, womanizer, and, was, known, for, treating, women, respectfully, gorbachev, was, baptized, russian, orthodox, and, when, he, was, growing, up, his, grandparents, had, been, practicing, christians, in, 2008, there, was, some, press, speculation, that, he, was, a, practicing, christian, after, he, visited, the, tomb, of, st, francis, of, assisi, to, which, he, publicly, clarified, that, he, was, an, atheist, since, studying, at, university, gorbachev, considered, himself, an, intellectual, doder, and, branson, thought, that, his, intellectualism, was, slightly, self, conscious, noting, that, unlike, most, russian, intelligentsia, gorbachev, was, not, closely, connected, to, the, world, of, science, culture, the, arts, or, education, when, living, in, stavropol, he, and, his, wife, collected, hundreds, of, books, among, his, favorite, authors, were, arthur, miller, dostoevsky, and, chinghiz, aitmatov, while, he, also, enjoyed, reading, detective, fiction, he, enjoyed, going, for, walks, having, a, love, of, natural, environments, and, was, also, a, fan, of, association, football, he, favored, small, gatherings, where, the, assembled, discussed, topics, like, art, and, philosophy, rather, than, the, large, alcohol, fueled, parties, common, among, soviet, officials, gorbachev, s, university, friend, mlyn, described, him, as, loyal, and, personally, honest, he, was, self, confident, polite, and, tactful, he, had, a, happy, and, optimistic, temperament, he, used, self, deprecating, humor, and, sometimes, profanities, and, often, referred, to, himself, in, the, third, person, he, was, a, skilled, manager, and, had, a, good, memory, a, hard, worker, or, workaholic, as, general, secretary, he, would, rise, at, 7, 00, or, 8, 00, in, the, morning, and, not, go, to, bed, until, 1, 00, or, 2, 00, he, commuted, from, the, western, suburbs, between, 9, and, 10, in, the, morning, and, returned, home, around, 8, in, the, evening, taubman, called, him, a, remarkably, decent, man, he, thought, gorbachev, to, have, high, moral, standards, zhores, medvedev, thought, he, was, a, talented, orator, in, 1986, stating, that, gorbachev, is, probably, the, best, speaker, there, has, been, in, the, top, party, echelons, since, leon, trotsky, medvedev, also, considered, gorbachev, a, charismatic, leader, something, brezhnev, andropov, and, chernenko, had, not, been, doder, and, branson, called, him, a, charmer, capable, of, intellectually, seducing, doubters, always, trying, to, co, opt, them, or, at, least, blunt, the, edge, of, their, criticism, mccauley, thought, gorbachev, displayed, great, tactical, skill, in, maneuvering, successfully, between, hardline, marxist, leninists, and, liberalisers, for, most, of, his, time, as, leader, adding, though, that, he, was, much, more, skilled, at, tactical, short, term, policy, than, strategic, long, term, thinking, in, part, because, he, was, given, to, making, policy, on, the, hoof, doder, and, branson, thought, gorbachev, a, russian, to, the, core, intensely, patriotic, as, only, people, living, in, the, border, regions, can, be, taubman, also, noted, that, the, former, soviet, leader, has, a, sense, of, self, importance, and, self, righteousness, as, well, as, a, need, for, attention, and, admiration, which, grated, on, some, of, his, colleagues, he, was, sensitive, to, personal, criticism, and, easily, took, offense, colleagues, were, often, frustrated, that, he, would, leave, tasks, unfinished, and, sometimes, also, felt, underappreciated, and, discarded, by, him, biographers, doder, and, branson, thought, that, gorbachev, was, a, puritan, with, a, proclivity, for, order, in, his, personal, life, taubman, noted, that, he, was, capable, of, blowing, up, for, calculated, effect, he, also, thought, that, by, 1990, when, his, domestic, popularity, was, waning, gorbachev, had, become, psychologically, dependent, on, being, lionized, abroad, a, trait, for, which, he, was, criticized, in, the, soviet, union, mccauley, was, of, the, view, that, one, of, his, weaknesses, was, an, inability, to, foresee, the, consequences, of, his, actions, gorbachev, died, at, the, central, clinical, hospital, in, moscow, on, 30, august, 2022, at, the, age, of, 91, he, died, after, a, severe, and, prolonged, illness, according, to, the, hospital, for, a, number, of, years, before, his, death,

length, of, his, hospital, visits, increased, in, 2019, with, gorbachev, hospitalized, in, december, with, pneumonia, at, the, beginning, of, 2020, gorbachev, was, placed, under, the, continuous,

said, that, lithuanians, would, not, glorify, gorbachev, or, forget, about, the, 1991, january, events, the, 14th, dalai, lama, wrote, to, the, gorbachev, foundation, to, express, his, condolences, to, his, daughter, irina, virganskaya, and, members, of, his, family, his, friends, and, supporters, japan, s, prime, minister, fumio, kishida, said, gorbachev, had, left, behind, great, as, a, world, leader, supporting, the, abolishment, of, nuclear, weapons, germany, s, former, chancellor, angela, merkel, who, grew, up, in, east, germany, said, he, completely, changed, her, life, and, the, world, while, current, german, chancellor, olaf, scholz, hailed, gorbachev, s, role, in, reuniting, germany, opinions, on, gorbachev, are, deeply, divided, according, to, a, 2017, survey, carried, out, by, the, independent, institute, levada, center, 46, of, russian, citizens, have, a, negative, opinion, towards, gorbachev, 30, are, indifferent, while, only, 15, have, a, positive, opinion, many, particularly, in, western, countries, see, him, as, the, greatest, statesman, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, us, press, referred, to, the, presence, of, gorbymania, in, western, countries, during, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, as, represented, by, large, crowds, that, turned, out, to, greet, his, visits, with, time, naming, him, its, man, of, the, decade, in, the, 1980s, in, the, soviet, union, itself, opinion, polls, indicated, that, gorbachev, was, the, most, popular, politician, from, 1985, through, to, late, 1989, for, his, domestic, supporters, gorbachev, was, seen, as, a, reformer, trying, to, modernise, the, soviet, union, and, to, build, a, form, of, democratic, socialism, taubman, characterized, gorbachev, as, a, visionary, who, changed, his, country, and, the, world, though, neither, as, much, as, he, wished, taubman, regarded, gorbachev, as, being, exceptional, as, a, russian, ruler, and, a, world, statesman, highlighting, that, he, avoided, the, traditional, authoritarian, anti, western, norm, of, both, predecessors, like, brezhnev, and, successors, like, putin, mccauley, thought, that, in, allowing, the, soviet, union, to, move, away, from, marxism, leninism, gorbachev, gave, the, soviet, people, something, precious, the, right, to, think, and, manage, their, lives, for, themselves, with, all, the, uncertainty, and, risk, that, that, entailed, gorbachev, succeeded, in, destroying, what, was, left, of, totalitarianism, in, the, soviet, union, he, brought, freedom, of, speech, of, assembly, and, of, conscience, to, people, who, had, never, known, it, except, perhaps, for, a, few, chaotic, months, in, 1917, by, introducing, free, elections, and, creating, parliamentary, institutions, he, laid, the, groundwork, for, democracy, it, is, more, the, fault, of, the, raw, material, he, worked, with, than, of, his, own, real, shortcomings, and, mistakes, that, russian, democracy, will, take, much, longer, to, build, than, he, thought, gorbachev, biographer, william, taubman, 2017, gorbachev, s, negotiations, with, the, us, helped, bring, an, end, to, the, cold, war, and, reduced, the, threat, of, nuclear, conflict, his, decision, to, allow, the, eastern, bloc, to, break, apart, prevented, significant, bloodshed, in, central, and, eastern, europe, as, taubman, noted, this, meant, that, the, soviet, empire, ended, in, a, far, more, peaceful, manner, than, the, british, empire, several, decades, before, similarly, under, gorbachev, the, soviet, union, broke, apart, without, falling, into, civil, war, as, happened, during, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, at, the, same, time, mccauley, noted, that, in, facilitating, the, merger, of, east, and, west, germany, gorbachev, was, a, co, father, of, german, unification, assuring, him, long, term, popularity, among, the, german, people, however, he, remains, a, controversial, figure, in, former, soviet, occupied, and, administered, countries, such, as, the, baltic, states, ukraine, georgia, kazakhstan, azerbaijan, and, poland, after, violent, repressions, against, the, local, populations, who, sought, independence, locals, have, stated, that, they, consider, western, veneration, of, the, man, an, injustice, and, have, said, they, do, not, understand, his, positive, legacy, in, the, west, with, a, group, of, lithuanians, having, pursued, legal, action, against, him, he, also, faced, domestic, criticism, during, his, rule, during, his, career, gorbachev, attracted, the, admiration, of, some, colleagues, but, others, came, to, hate, him, across, society, more, broadly, his, inability, to, reverse, the, decline, in, the, soviet, economy, brought, discontent, liberals, thought, he, lacked, the, radicalism, to, really, break, from, marxism, leninism, and, establish, a, free, market, liberal, democracy, conversely, many, of, his, communist, party, critics, thought, his, reforms, were, reckless, and, threatened, the, survival, of, soviet, socialism, some, believed, he, should, have, followed, the, example, of, china, s, communist, party, and, restricted, himself, to, economic, rather, than, governmental, reforms, many, russians, saw, his, emphasis, on, persuasion, rather, than, force, as, a, sign, of, weakness, for, much, of, the, communist, party, nomenklatura, the, soviet, union, s, dissolution, was, disastrous, as, it, resulted, in, their, loss, of, power, in, russia, he, is, widely, despised, for, his, role, in, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, ensuing, economic, collapse, in, the, 1990s, general, varennikov, one, of, those, who, orchestrated, the, 1991, coup, attempt, against, gorbachev, for, instance, called, him, a, renegade, and, traitor, to, your, own, people, many, of, his, critics, attacked, him, for, allowing, the, marxist, leninist, governments, across, eastern, europe, to, fall, and, for, allowing, a, reunited, germany, to, join, nato, something, they, deem, to, be, contrary, to, russia, s, national, interest, the, historian, mark, galeotti, stressed, the, connection, between, gorbachev, and, his, predecessor, andropov, in, galeotti, s, view, andropov, was, the, godfather, of, the, gorbachev, revolution, because, as, a, former, head, of, the, kgb, he, was, able, to, put, forward, the, case, for, reform, without, having, his, loyalty, to, the, soviet, cause, questioned, an, approach, that, gorbachev, was, able, to, build, on, and, follow, through, with, according, to, mccauley, gorbachev, set, reforms, in, motion, without, understanding,
