james, hutton, frse, h, t, n, 3, june, o, s, 1726, 26, march, 1797, was, a, scottish, geologist, agriculturalist, chemical, manufacturer, naturalist, and, physician, often, referred, to, as, the, father, of, modern, geology, he, played, a, key, role, in, establishing, geology, as, a, modern, science, hutton, advanced, the, idea, that, the, physical, world, s, remote, history, can, be, inferred, from, evidence, in, present, day, rocks, through, his, study, of, features, in, the, landscape, and, coastlines, of, his, native, scottish, lowlands, such, as, salisbury, crags, or, siccar, point, he, developed, the, theory, that, geological, features, could, not, be, static, but, underwent, continuing, transformation, over, indefinitely, long, periods, of, time, from, this, he, argued, in, agreement, with, many, other, early, geologists, that, the, earth, could, not, be, young, he, was, one, of, the, earliest, proponents, of, what, in, the, 1830s, became, known, as, uniformitarianism, the, science, which, explains, features, of, the, earth, s, crust, as, the, outcome, of, continuing, natural, processes, over, the, long, geologic, time, scale, hutton, also, put, forward, a, thesis, for, a, system, of, the, habitable, earth, proposed, as, a, deistic, mechanism, designed, to, keep, the, world, eternally, suitable, for, humans, an, early, attempt, to, formulate, what, today, might, be, called, one, kind, of, anthropic, principle, some, reflections, similar, to, those, of, hutton, can, be, found, in, publications, of, his, contemporaries, such, as, the, french, naturalist, georges, louis, leclerc, de, buffon, but, it, is, chiefly, hutton, s, pioneering, work, that, established, the, field, hutton, was, born, in, edinburgh, on, 3, june, o, s, 1726, as, one, of, five, children, of, sarah, balfour, and, william, hutton, a, merchant, who, was, edinburgh, city, treasurer, hutton, s, father, died, in, 1729, when, he, was, three, he, was, educated, at, the, high, school, of, edinburgh, where, he, was, particularly, interested, in, mathematics, and, chemistry, then, when, he, was, 14, he, attended, the, university, of, edinburgh, as, a, student, of, humanity, studying, the, classics, he, was, apprenticed, to, the, lawyer, george, chalmers, ws, when, he, was, 17, but, took, more, interest, in, chemical, experiments, than, legal, work, at, the, age, of, 18, he, became, a, physician, s, assistant, and, attended, lectures, in, medicine, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, after, a, two, year, stay, in, paris, james, hutton, arrived, in, leiden, in, 1749, where, he, enrolled, at, the, university, of, leiden, on, 14, august, 1749, at, the, home, of, the, then, rector, magnificus, joachim, schwartz, to, obtain, a, doctorate, in, medicine, he, stayed, with, the, widow, van, der, tas, n, e, judith, bouvat, at, the, langebrug, which, corresponds, to, the, current, address, langebrug, 101, in, leiden, his, supervisor, was, professor, frederik, winter, who, was, not, only, a, professor, at, leiden, university, but, also, court, physician, to, the, stadholder, the, latin, manuscript, of, hutton, s, dissertation, also, contained, 92, theses, two, of, which, were, successfully, defended, in, public, by, james, hutton, on, 3, september, 1749, on, 12, september, 1749, james, hutton, obtained, his, doctorate, in, medicine, from, leiden, university, with, a, physico, medical, thesis, entitled, sanguine, et, circulatione, microcosmi, the, thesis, was, printed, by, wilhelmus, boot, book, printer, in, leiden, it, is, believed, that, james, hutton, returned, to, britain, shortly, after, his, promotion, 2, after, his, degree, hutton, went, to, london, then, in, mid, 1750, returned, to, edinburgh, and, resumed, chemical, experiments, with, close, friend, john, davie, their, work, on, production, of, sal, ammoniac, from, soot, led, to, their, partnership, in, a, profitable, chemical, works, 2, manufacturing, the, crystalline, salt, which, was, used, for, dyeing, metalworking, and, as, smelling, salts, and, had, been, available, only, from, natural, sources, and, had, to, be, imported, from, egypt, hutton, owned, and, rented, out, properties, in, edinburgh, employing, a, factor, to, manage, this, business, hutton, inherited, from, his, father, the, berwickshire, farms, of, slighhouses, a, lowland, farm, which, had, been, in, the, family, since, 1713, and, the, hill, farm, of, nether, monynut, 2, 3, in, the, early, 1750s, he, moved, to, slighhouses, and, set, about, making, improvements, introducing, farming, practices, from, other, parts, of, britain, and, experimenting, with, plant, and, animal, husbandry, 2, 3, he, recorded, his, ideas, and, innovations, in, an, unpublished, treatise, on, the, elements, of, agriculture, 60, this, developed, his, interest, in, meteorology, and, geology, in, a, 1753, letter, he, wrote, that, he, had, become, very, fond, of, studying, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, was, looking, with, anxious, curiosity, into, every, pit, or, ditch, or, bed, of, a, river, that, fell, in, his, way, clearing, and, draining, his, farm, provided, ample, opportunities, the, mathematician, john, playfair, described, hutton, as, having, noticed, that, a, vast, proportion, of, the, present, rocks, are, composed, of, materials, afforded, by, the, destruction, of, bodies, animal, vegetable, and, mineral, of, more, ancient, formation, his, theoretical, ideas, began, to, come, together, in, 1760, while, his, farming, activities, continued, in, 1764, he, went, on, a, geological, tour, of, the, north, of, scotland, with, george, maxwell, clerk, ancestor, of, the, famous, james, clerk, maxwell, in, 1768, hutton, returned, to, edinburgh, letting, his, farms, to, tenants, but, continuing, to, take, an, interest, in, farm, improvements, and, research, which, included, experiments, carried, out, at, slighhouses, he, developed, a, red, dye, made, from, the, roots, of, the, madder, plant, he, had, a, house, built, in, 1770, at, st, john, s, hill, edinburgh, overlooking, salisbury, crags, this, later, became, the, balfour, family, home, and, in, 1840, the, birthplace, of, the, psychiatrist, james, crichton, browne, hutton, was, one, of, the, most, influential, participants, in, the, scottish, enlightenment, and, fell, in, with, numerous, first, class, minds, in, the, sciences, including, mathematician, john, playfair, philosopher, david, hume, and, economist, adam, smith, hutton, held, no, position, in, the, university, of, edinburgh, and, communicated, his, scientific, findings, through, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, he, was, particularly, friendly, with, physician, and, chemist, joseph, black, and, together, with, adam, smith, they, founded, the, oyster, club, for, weekly, meetings, between, 1767, and, 1774, hutton, had, close, involvement, with, the, construction, of, the, forth, and, clyde, canal, making, full, use, of, his, geological, knowledge, both, as, a, shareholder, and, as, a, member, of, the, committee, of, management, and, attended, meetings, including, extended, site, inspections, of, all, the, works, at, this, time, he, is, listed, as, living, on, bernard, street, in, leith, in, 1777, he, published, a, pamphlet, on, considerations, on, the, nature, quality, and, distinctions, of, coal, and, culm, which, successfully, helped, to, obtain, relief, from, excise, duty, on, carrying, small, coal, in, 1783, he, was, a, joint, founder, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, from, 1791, hutton, suffered, extreme, pain, from, stones, in, the, bladder, and, gave, up, field, work, to, concentrate, on, finishing, his, books, a, dangerous, and, painful, operation, failed, to, resolve, his, illness, he, died, in, edinburgh, and, was, buried, in, the, vault, of, andrew, balfour, opposite, the, vault, of, his, friend, joseph, black, in, the, now, sealed, south, west, section, of, greyfriars, kirkyard, in, edinburgh, commonly, known, as, the, covenanter, s, prison, hutton, did, not, marry, and, had, no, legitimate, children, around, 1747, he, had, a, son, by, a, miss, edington, and, though, he, gave, his, child, james, smeaton, hutton, financial, assistance, he, had, little, to, do, with, the, boy, who, went, on, to, become, a, post, office, clerk, in, london, hutton, developed, several, hypotheses, to, explain, the, rock, formations, he, saw, around, him, but, according, to, playfair, he, was, in, no, haste, to, publish, his, theory, for, he, was, one, of, those, who, are, much, more, delighted, with, the, contemplation, of, truth, than, with, the, praise, of, having, discovered, it, after, some, 25, years, of, work, his, theory, of, the, earth, or, an, investigation, of, the, laws, observable, in, the, composition, dissolution, and, restoration, of, land, upon, the, globe, was, read, to, meetings, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, two, parts, the, first, by, his, friend, joseph, black, on, 7, march, 1785, and, the, second, by, himself, on, 4, april, 1785, hutton, subsequently, read, an, abstract, of, his, dissertation, concerning, the, system, of, the, earth, its, duration, and, stability, to, society, meeting, on, 4, july, 1785, which, he, had, printed, and, circulated, privately, in, it, he, outlined, his, theory, as, follows, the, solid, parts, of, the, present, land, appear, in, general, to, have, been, composed, of, the, productions, of, the, sea, and, of, other, materials, similar, to, those, now, found, upon, the, shores, hence, we, find, reason, to, conclude, 1st, that, the, land, on, which, we, rest, is, not, simple, and, original, but, that, it, is, a, composition, and, had, been, formed, by, the, operation, of, second, causes, 2nd, that, before, the, present, land, was, made, there, had, subsisted, a, world, composed, of, sea, and, land, in, which, were, tides, and, currents, with, such, operations, at, the, bottom, of, the, sea, as, now, take, place, and, lastly, that, while, the, present, land, was, forming, at, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, the, former, land, maintained, plants, and, animals, at, least, the, sea, was, then, inhabited, by, animals, in, a, similar, manner, as, it, is, at, present, hence, we, are, led, to, conclude, that, the, greater, part, of, our, land, if, not, the, whole, had, been, produced, by, operations, natural, to, this, globe, but, that, in, order, to, make, this, land, a, permanent, body, resisting, the, operations, of, the, waters, two, things, had, been, required, 1st, the, consolidation, of, masses, formed, by, collections, of, loose, or, incoherent, materials, 2ndly, the, elevation, of, those, consolidated, masses, from, the, bottom, of, the, sea, the, place, where, they, were, collected, to, the, stations, in, which, they, now, remain, above, the, level, of, the, ocean, in, the, summer, of, 1785, at, glen, tilt, and, other, sites, in, the, cairngorm, mountains, in, the, scottish, highlands, hutton, found, granite, penetrating, metamorphic, schists, in, a, way, which, indicated, that, the, granite, had, been, molten, at, the, time, this, was, hutton, s, first, geological, field, trip, and, he, was, invited, by, the, duke, of, atholl, to, his, hunting, lodge, forest, lodge, the, exposures, at, the, dail, an, eas, bridge, demonstrated, to, him, that, granite, formed, from, the, cooling, of, molten, rock, rather, than, it, precipitating, out, of, water, as, others, at, the, time, believed, and, therefore, the, granite, must, be, younger, than, the, schists, hutton, presented, his, theory, of, the, earth, on, 4, march, and, 7, april, 1785, at, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, he, went, on, to, find, a, similar, penetration, of, volcanic, rock, through, sedimentary, rock, in, edinburgh, at, salisbury, crags, adjoining, arthur, s, seat, this, area, of, the, crags, is, now, known, as, hutton, s, section, he, found, other, examples, in, galloway, in, 1786, and, on, the, isle, of, arran, in, 1787, the, existence, of, angular, unconformities, had, been, noted, by, nicolas, steno, and, by, french, geologists, including, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, who, interpreted, them, in, terms, of, neptunism, as, primary, formations, hutton, wanted, to, examine, such, formations, himself, to, see, particular, marks, of, the, relationship, between, the, rock, layers, on, the, 1787, trip, to, the, isle, of, arran, he, found, his, first, example, of, hutton, s, unconformity, to, the, north, of, newton, point, near, lochranza, but, the, limited, view, meant, that, the, condition, of, the, underlying, strata, was, not, clear, enough, for, him, and, he, incorrectly, thought, that, the, strata, were, conformable, at, a, depth, below, the, exposed, outcrop, later, in, 1787, hutton, noted, what, is, now, known, as, the, hutton, or, great, unconformity, at, inchbonny, jedburgh, in, layers, of, sedimentary, rock, as, shown, in, the, illustrations, to, the, right, layers, of, greywacke, in, the, lower, layers, of, the, cliff, face, are, tilted, almost, vertically, and, above, an, intervening, layer, of, conglomerate, lie, horizontal, layers, of, old, red, sandstone, he, later, wrote, of, how, he, rejoiced, at, my, good, fortune, in, stumbling, upon, an, object, so, interesting, in, the, natural, history, of, the, earth, and, which, i, had, been, long, looking, for, in, vain, that, year, he, found, the, same, sequence, in, teviotdale, in, the, spring, of, 1788, he, set, off, with, john, playfair, to, the, berwickshire, coast, and, found, more, examples, of, this, sequence, in, the, valleys, of, the, tour, and, pease, burns, near, cockburnspath, they, then, took, a, boat, trip, from, dunglass, burn, east, along, the, coast, with, the, geologist, sir, james, hall, of, dunglass, they, found, the, sequence, in, the, cliff, below, st, helens, then, just, to, the, east, at, siccar, point, found, what, hutton, called, a, beautiful, picture, of, this, junction, washed, bare, by, the, sea, playfair, later, commented, about, the, experience, the, mind, seemed, to, grow, giddy, by, looking, so, far, into, the, abyss, of, time, continuing, along, the, coast, they, made, more, discoveries, including, sections, of, the, vertical, beds, showing, strong, ripple, marks, which, gave, hutton, great, satisfaction, as, a, confirmation, of, his, supposition, that, these, beds, had, been, laid, horizontally, in, water, he, also, found, conglomerate, at, altitudes, that, demonstrated, the, extent, of, erosion, of, the, strata, and, said, of, this, that, we, never, should, have, dreamed, of, meeting, with, what, we, now, perceived, hutton, reasoned, that, there, must, have, been, innumerable, cycles, each, involving, deposition, on, the, seabed, uplift, with, tilting, and, erosion, then, undersea, again, for, further, layers, to, be, deposited, on, the, belief, that, this, was, due, to, the, same, geological, forces, operating, in, the, past, as, the, very, slow, geological, forces, seen, operating, at, the, present, day, the, thicknesses, of, exposed, rock, layers, implied, to, him, enormous, stretches, of, time, though, hutton, circulated, privately, a, printed, version, of, the, abstract, of, his, theory, concerning, the, system, of, the, earth, its, duration, and, stability, which, he, read, at, a, meeting, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, on, 4, july, 1785, the, full, account, of, his, theory, as, read, at, 7, march, 1785, and, 4, april, 1785, meetings, did, not, appear, in, print, until, 1788, it, was, titled, theory, of, the, earth, or, an, investigation, of, the, laws, observable, in, the, composition, dissolution, and, restoration, of, land, upon, the, globe, and, appeared, in, transactions, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, vol, i, part, ii, pp, 209, 304, plates, i, and, ii, published, 1788, he, put, forward, the, view, that, from, what, has, actually, been, we, have, data, for, concluding, with, regard, to, that, which, is, to, happen, thereafter, this, restated, the, scottish, enlightenment, concept, which, david, hume, had, put, in, 1777, as, all, inferences, from, experience, suppose, that, the, future, will, resemble, the, past, and, charles, lyell, memorably, rephrased, in, the, 1830s, as, the, present, is, the, key, to, the, past, hutton, s, 1788, paper, concludes, the, result, therefore, of, our, present, enquiry, is, that, we, find, no, vestige, of, a, beginning, no, prospect, of, an, end, his, memorably, phrased, closing, statement, has, long, been, celebrated, it, was, quoted, in, the, 1989, song, no, control, by, songwriter, and, professor, greg, graffin, following, criticism, especially, the, arguments, from, richard, kirwan, who, thought, hutton, s, ideas, were, atheistic, and, not, logical, hutton, published, a, two, volume, version, of, his, theory, in, 1795, consisting, of, the, 1788, version, of, his, theory, with, slight, additions, along, with, a, lot, of, material, drawn, from, shorter, papers, hutton, already, had, to, hand, on, various, subjects, such, as, the, origin, of, granite, it, included, a, review, of, alternative, theories, such, as, those, of, thomas, burnet, and, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, the, whole, was, entitled, an, investigation, of, the, principles, of, knowledge, and, of, the, progress, of, reason, from, sense, to, science, and, philosophy, when, the, third, volume, was, completed, in, 1794, its, 2, 138, pages, prompted, playfair, to, remark, that, the, great, size, of, the, book, and, the, obscurity, which, may, justly, be, objected, to, many, parts, of, it, have, probably, prevented, it, from, being, received, as, it, deserves, his, new, theories, placed, him, into, opposition, with, the, then, popular, neptunist, theories, of, the, german, geologist, abraham, gottlob, werner, that, all, rocks, had, precipitated, out, of, a, single, enormous, flood, hutton, proposed, that, the, interior, of, the, earth, was, hot, and, that, this, heat, was, the, engine, which, drove, the, creation, of, new, rock, land, was, eroded, by, air, and, water, and, deposited, as, layers, in, the, sea, heat, then, consolidated, the, sediment, into, stone, and, uplifted, it, into, new, lands, this, theory, was, dubbed, plutonist, in, contrast, to, the, flood, oriented, theory, as, well, as, combating, the, neptunists, he, also, accepted, the, growing, consensus, on, the, concept, of, deep, time, for, scientific, purposes, rather, than, accepting, that, the, earth, was, no, more, than, a, few, thousand, years, old, he, maintained, that, the, earth, must, be, much, older, with, a, history, extending, indefinitely, into, the, distant, past, his, main, line, of, argument, was, that, the, tremendous, displacements, and, changes, he, was, seeing, did, not, happen, in, a, short, period, of, time, by, means, of, catastrophe, but, that, processes, still, happening, on, the, earth, in, the, present, day, had, caused, them, as, these, processes, were, very, gradual, the, earth, needed, to, be, ancient, to, allow, time, for, the, changes, contemporary, investigations, had, shown, that, the, geologic, record, required, vast, time, but, no, good, way, of, assigning, actual, years, was, found, for, over, a, century, rudwick, bursting, the, limits, of, time, hutton, s, idea, of, infinite, cycles, with, humans, present, throughout, is, quite, different, from, modern, geology, with, a, definite, time, of, formation, and, directional, change, through, time, but, his, supporting, evidence, for, the, long, term, effects, of, geological, processes, was, valuable, in, the, development, of, historical, geology, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, prose, of, principles, of, knowledge, was, so, obscure, that, it, also, impeded, the, acceptance, of, hutton, s, geological, theories, restatements, of, his, geological, ideas, though, not, his, thoughts, on, evolution, by, john, playfair, in, 1802, and, then, charles, lyell, in, the, 1830s, popularised, the, concept, of, an, infinitely, repeating, cycle, though, lyell, tended, to, dismiss, hutton, s, views, as, giving, too, much, credence, to, catastrophic, changes, it, was, not, merely, the, earth, to, which, hutton, directed, his, attention, he, had, long, studied, the, changes, of, the, atmosphere, the, same, volume, in, which, his, theory, of, the, earth, appeared, contained, also, a, theory, of, rain, he, contended, that, the, amount, of, moisture, which, the, air, can, retain, in, solution, increases, with, temperature, and, therefore, that, on, the, mixture, of, two, masses, of, air, of, different, temperatures, a, portion, of, the, moisture, must, be, condensed, and, appear, in, visible, form, he, investigated, the, available, data, regarding, rainfall, and, climate, in, different, regions, of, the, globe, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, rainfall, is, regulated, by, the, humidity, of, the, air, on, the, one, hand, and, mixing, of, different, air, currents, in, the, higher, atmosphere, on, the, other, hutton, taught, that, biological, and, geological, processes, are, interlinked, james, lovelock, who, developed, the, gaia, hypothesis, in, the, 1970s, cites, hutton, as, saying, that, the, earth, was, a, superorganism, and, that, its, proper, study, should, be, physiology, lovelock, writes, that, hutton, s, view, of, the, earth, was, rejected, because, of, the, intense, reductionism, among, 19th, century, scientists, hutton, also, advocated, uniformitarianism, for, living, creatures, evolution, in, a, sense, and, even, suggested, natural, selection, as, a, possible, mechanism, affecting, them, hutton, gave, the, example, that, where, dogs, survived, through, swiftness, of, foot, and, quickness, of, sight, the, most, defective, in, respect, of, those, necessary, qualities, would, be, the, most, subject, to, perish, and, that, those, who, employed, them, in, greatest, perfection, would, be, those, who, would, remain, to, preserve, themselves, and, to, continue, the, race, equally, if, an, acute, sense, of, smell, became, more, necessary, to, the, sustenance, of, the, animal, the, same, principle, change, the, qualities, of, the, animal, and, produce, a, race, of, well, scented, hounds, instead, of, those, who, catch, their, prey, by, swiftness, the, same, principle, of, variation, would, influence, every, species, of, plant, whether, growing, in, a, forest, or, a, meadow, he, came, to, his, ideas, as, the, result, of, experiments, in, plant, and, animal, breeding, some, of, which, he, outlined, in, an, unpublished, manuscript, the, elements, of, agriculture, he, distinguished, between, heritable, variation, as, the, result, of, breeding, and, non, heritable, variations, caused, by, environmental, differences, such, as, soil, and, climate, though, he, saw, his, principle, of, variation, as, explaining, the, development, of, varieties, hutton, rejected, the, idea, that, evolution, might, originate, species, as, a, romantic, fantasy, according, to, palaeoclimatologist, paul, pearson, influenced, by, deism, hutton, thought, the, mechanism, allowed, species, to, form, varieties, better, adapted, to, particular, conditions, and, provided, evidence, of, benevolent, design, in, nature, studies, of, charles, darwin, s, notebooks, have, shown, that, darwin, arrived, separately, at, the, idea, of, natural, selection, which, he, set, out, in, his, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, but, it, has, been, speculated, that, he, had, some, half, forgotten, memory, from, his, time, as, a, student, in, edinburgh, of, ideas, of, selection, in, nature, as, set, out, by, hutton, and, by, william, charles, wells, and, patrick, matthew, who, had, both, been, associated, with, the, city, before, publishing, their, ideas, on, the, topic, early, in, the, 19th, century
