dirschau, and, suffered, a, defeat, at, trzciana, his, reign, became, known, from, his, actions, a, few, years, later, when, in, june, 1630, he, landed, in, germany, marking, the, swedish, intervention, in, the, thirty, years, war, gustavus, adolphus, intervened, on, the, anti, imperial, side, which, at, the, time, was, losing, to, the, holy, roman, empire, and, its, catholic, allies, the, swedish, forces, would, quickly, reverse, that, situation, gustavus, adolphus, was, married, to, maria, eleonora, of, brandenburg, the, daughter, of, john, sigismund, elector, of, brandenburg, and, chose, the, prussian, city, of, elbing, as, the, base, for, his, operations, in, germany, he, died, in, the, battle, of, l, tzen, in, 1632, his, involvement, in, the, thirty, years, war, gave, rise, to, the, nickname, the, lion, from, the, north, historian, ronald, s, love, wrote, that, in, 1560, 1660, there, were, a, few, innovators, notably, maurice, of, nassau, and, gustavus, adolphus, of, sweden, whom, many, scholars, credit, with, revolutionary, developments, in, warfare, and, with, having, laid, the, foundations, of, military, practice, for, the, next, two, centuries, scholars, consider, him, an, extremely, able, military, commander, his, integration, of, infantry, cavalry, logistics, and, particularly, his, use, of, artillery, earned, him, the, title, of, the, father, of, modern, warfare, future, commanders, who, studied, and, admired, gustavus, adolphus, include, napoleon, i, of, france, and, carl, von, clausewitz, his, advancements, in, warfare, helped, make, sweden, the, dominant, baltic, power, for, the, next, hundred, years, see, swedish, empire, he, is, also, the, only, swedish, monarch, to, be, styled, the, great, this, decision, was, made, by, the, swedish, riksdag, of, the, estates, in, 1634, making, him, officially, called, gustavus, adolphus, the, great, gustavus, adolphus, magnus, gustavus, adolphus, was, the, main, figure, responsible, for, the, success, of, swedish, arms, during, the, thirty, years, war, and, led, his, nation, to, great, prestige, as, a, general, gustavus, adolphus, employed, mobile, artillery, on, the, battlefield, as, well, as, very, aggressive, tactics, where, attack, was, stressed, over, defense, and, mobility, and, cavalry, initiative, were, emphasized, among, other, innovations, he, installed, an, early, form, of, combined, arms, in, his, formations, where, the, cavalry, could, attack, from, the, safety, of, an, infantry, line, reinforced, by, cannon, and, retire, again, within, to, regroup, after, their, foray, inspired, by, the, reform, of, maurice, of, nassau, he, adopted, much, shallower, infantry, formations, than, were, common, in, the, pike, and, shot, armies, of, the, era, with, formations, typically, fighting, in, 5, or, 6, ranks, occasionally, supported, at, some, distance, by, another, such, formation, the, gaps, being, the, provinces, of, the, artillery, and, cavalry, as, noted, above, his, artillery, were, themselves, different, in, addition, to, the, usual, complements, of, heavy, cannon, he, introduced, light, mobile, guns, for, the, first, time, into, the, renaissance, battlefield, these, were, grouped, in, batteries, supporting, his, more, linearly, deployed, formations, replacing, the, cumbersome, and, unmaneuverable, traditional, deep, squares, such, as, the, spanish, tercios, that, were, up, to, 50, ranks, deep, used, in, other, pike, and, shot, armies, of, the, day, in, consequence, his, forces, could, redeploy, and, reconfigure, very, rapidly, confounding, his, enemies, he, created, the, modern, swedish, navy, which, transported, troops, and, supplies, to, the, continental, battlefront, carl, von, clausewitz, and, napoleon, bonaparte, considered, him, one, of, the, greatest, generals, of, all, time, an, evaluation, agreed, with, by, george, s, patton, and, others, he, was, also, renowned, for, his, constancy, of, purpose, and, the, equality, of, his, troops, no, one, part, of, his, armies, was, considered, better, or, received, preferred, treatment, as, was, common, in, other, armies, where, the, cavalry, were, the, elite, followed, by, the, artillery, and, both, disdained, the, lowly, infantry, in, gustavus, adolphus, s, army, the, units, were, extensively, cross, trained, both, cavalry, and, infantry, could, service, the, artillery, as, his, heavy, cavalry, did, when, turning, captured, artillery, on, the, opposing, catholic, tercios, at, first, breitenfeld, pikemen, could, shoot, if, not, as, accurately, as, those, designated, musketeers, so, a, valuable, firearm, could, be, kept, in, the, firing, line, his, infantrymen, and, gunners, were, taught, to, ride, if, needed, napoleon, thought, highly, of, the, achievement, and, copied, the, tactics, however, recent, historians, have, challenged, his, reputation, b, h, liddell, hart, says, it, is, an, exaggeration, to, credit, him, with, a, uniquely, disciplined, conscript, army, or, call, his, the, first, military, state, to, fight, a, protracted, war, on, the, continent, he, argues, that, he, improved, existing, techniques, and, used, them, brilliantly, richard, brzezinski, says, his, legendary, status, was, based, on, inaccurate, myths, created, by, later, historians, many, of, his, innovations, were, developed, by, his, senior, staff, gustavus, adolphus, politics, also, show, progressive, tendencies, for, example, in, 1631, in, the, conquered, territory, of, estonia, he, forced, the, local, nobility, into, granting, more, individual, rights, to, the, commoners, he, also, encouraged, education, opening, a, school, in, tallinn, in, 1631, today, known, as, gustav, adolf, grammar, school, estonian, gustav, adolfi, g, mnaasium, on, 30, june, 1632, gustavus, adolphus, signed, the, decree, for, the, foundation, of, academia, dorpatensis, in, estonia, today, known, as, the, university, of, tartu, despite, significant, hardships, for, the, common, people, the, period, of, swedish, rule, over, estonia, has, been, idealized, in, local, folklore, as, the, good, old, swedish, times, which, has, been, attributed, to, comparisons, with, the, harder, times, that, followed, under, the, russian, rule, on, 27, august, 1617, his, speech, before, his, coronation, included, the, following, statement, i, had, carefully, learned, to, understand, about, that, experience, which, i, could, have, upon, things, of, rule, how, fortune, is, failing, or, great, subject, to, such, rule, in, common, so, that, otherwise, i, would, have, had, scant, reason, to, desire, such, a, rule, had, i, not, found, myself, obliged, to, it, through, god, s, bidding, and, nature, now, it, was, of, my, acquaintance, that, inasmuch, as, god, had, let, me, be, born, a, prince, such, as, i, then, am, born, then, my, good, and, my, destruction, were, knotted, into, one, with, the, common, good, for, every, reason, then, it, was, now, my, promise, that, i, should, take, great, pains, about, their, well, being, and, good, governance, and, management, and, thereabout, bear, close, concern, gustavus, adolphus, inherited, three, wars, from, his, father, when, he, ascended, the, throne, against, denmark, norway, which, had, attacked, sweden, earlier, in, 1611, against, russia, due, to, sweden, having, tried, to, take, advantage, of, the, russian, time, of, troubles, and, against, poland, lithuania, due, to, king, charles, s, having, deposed, king, sigismund, iii, his, nephew, as, king, of, sweden, the, war, against, denmark, norway, kalmar, war, during, which, gustavus, fought, in, minor, military, actions, the, victorious, for, sweden, storming, of, kristianopel, and, the, unsuccessful, battle, of, vittsj, was, concluded, in, 1613, with, a, peace, that, did, not, cost, sweden, any, territory, except, for, lvsborg, castle, which, sweden, had, to, pay, to, get, back, but, it, was, forced, to, pay, a, heavy, indemnity, to, denmark, norway, treaty, of, kn, red, during, this, war, gustavus, adolphus, let, his, soldiers, plunder, towns, and, villages, and, as, he, met, little, resistance, from, danish, forces, in, scania, they, pillaged, and, devastated, twenty, four, scanian, parishes, his, memory, in, scania, has, been, negative, because, of, that, fear, the, largest, destroyed, settlement, was, the, town, v, which, two, years, later, was, replaced, by, danish, norwegian, king, christian, iv, as, the, nearby, christiansted, after, the, swedification, process, spelled, kristianstad, the, last, scanian, town, to, be, founded, by, a, danish, king, the, war, against, russia, ingrian, war, marked, gustavus, involvement, in, the, successful, siege, of, gdov, and, the, failed, siege, of, pskov, and, ended, in, 1617, with, the, treaty, of, stolbovo, which, excluded, russia, from, the, baltic, sea, the, final, inherited, war, the, war, against, poland, ended, in, 1629, with, the, truce, of, altmark, which, transferred, the, large, province, of, livonia, to, sweden, and, freed, the, swedish, forces, for, the, subsequent, intervention, in, the, thirty, years, war, in, germany, where, swedish, forces, had, already, established, a, bridgehead, in, 1628, the, electorate, of, brandenburg, was, especially, torn, apart, by, a, quarrel, between, the, protestant, and, catholic, parties, the, brandenburg, minister, and, diplomat, baron, samuel, von, winterfeld, influenced, gustavus, adolphus, to, support, and, protect, the, protestant, side, in, germany, when, gustavus, adolphus, began, his, push, into, northern, germany, in, june, july, 1630, he, had, just, 4, 000, troops, he, was, soon, able, to, consolidate, the, protestant, position, in, the, north, however, using, reinforcements, from, sweden, and, money, supplied, by, france, at, the, treaty, of, b, rwalde, after, swedish, plundering, in, brandenburg, 1631, endangered, the, system, of, retrieving, war, contributions, from, occupied, territories, marauding, and, plundering, by, swedish, soldiers, was, prohibited, meanwhile, a, catholic, army, under, johann, tserclaes, count, of, tilly, was, laying, waste, to, saxony, gustavus, adolphus, met, tilly, s, army, and, won, a, decisive, victory, at, the, first, battle, of, breitenfeld, in, september, 1631, he, then, marched, across, germany, establishing, his, winter, quarters, near, the, rhine, making, plans, for, the, invasion, of, the, rest, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, march, 1632, gustavus, adolphus, invaded, bavaria, an, ally, of, the, emperor, he, forced, the, withdrawal, of, his, catholic, opponents, at, the, battle, of, rain, marking, the, high, point, of, the, campaign, in, the, summer, of, that, year, he, sought, a, political, solution, that, would, preserve, the, existing, structure, of, states, in, germany, while, guaranteeing, the, security, of, its, protestants, but, achieving, these, objectives, depended, on, his, continued, success, on, the, battlefield, some, other, military, actions, in, the, thirty, years, war, with, gustavus, at, the, head, were, the, victorious, battles, of, frankfurt, an, der, oder, and, werben, the, botched, siege, of, nuremberg, the, battle, of, f, rth, and, the, unfavourable, battle, of, the, alte, veste, gustavus, adolphus, is, reported, to, have, entered, battle, without, wearing, any, armor, proclaiming, the, lord, god, is, my, protector, however, it, is, more, likely, that, he, simply, wore, a, padded, cuirass, rather, than, going, into, battle, wearing, no, battle, protection, whatsoever, in, 1627, near, dirschau, in, prussia, a, polish, soldier, shot, him, in, the, muscles, above, his, shoulders, he, survived, but, the, doctors, could, not, remove, the, bullet, so, from, that, point, on, he, could, not, wear, iron, armor, and, two, fingers, of, his, right, hand, were, paralyzed, the, plate, cuirass, normally, worn, by, important, officers, at, that, time, was, replaced, by, a, buff, coat, made, of, moose, hide, which, would, have, serious, consequences, later, on, 6, november, 1632, gustavus, adolphus, encountered, the, imperial, army, under, albrecht, von, wallenstein, at, l, tzen, in, what, would, prove, to, be, one, of, the, most, significant, battles, of, the, thirty, years, war, gustavus, adolphus, was, killed, when, at, a, crucial, point, in, the, battle, he, became, separated, from, his, troops, while, leading, a, cavalry, charge, on, his, wing, l, tzen, was, a, victory, for, the, protestants, but, cost, them, their, leader, which, caused, their, campaign, to, lose, direction, and, finally, suffer, a, crushing, defeat, at, n, rdlingen, towards, 1, 00, pm, in, the, thick, mix, of, gun, smoke, and, fog, covering, the, field, the, king, was, separated, from, his, fellow, riders, and, suffered, multiple, shots, a, bullet, crushed, his, left, arm, below, the, elbow, almost, simultaneously, his, horse, suffered, a, shot, to, the, neck, that, made, it, hard, to, control, in, the, mix, of, fog, and, smoke, from, the, burning, town, of, l, tzen, the, king, rode, astray, behind, enemy, lines, there, he, sustained, yet, another, shot, in, the, back, was, stabbed, and, fell, from, his, horse, lying, on, the, ground, he, received, a, final, fatal, shot, to, the, temple, his, fate, remained, unknown, for, some, time, however, when, the, gunnery, paused, and, the, smoke, cleared, his, horse, was, spotted, between, the, two, lines, gustavus, adolphus, himself, not, on, it, and, nowhere, to, be, seen, his, disappearance, stopped, the, initiative, of, the, hitherto, successful, swedish, right, wing, while, a, search, was, conducted, his, partly, stripped, body, was, found, an, hour, or, two, later, and, evacuated, from, the, field, in, a, swedish, artillery, wagon, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, several, stories, were, retold, about, gustav, adolphus, s, death, in, most, of, them, the, assassin, was, named, as, prince, francis, albert, of, saxe, lauenburg, who, was, next, to, the, king, on, the, occasion, and, was, thought, to, be, acting, on, behalf, of, the, enemy, when, king, charles, xii, of, sweden, was, shown, purported, evidence, in, 1707, he, dismissed, the, theory, out, of, doubt, that, any, prince, could, be, so, ungrateful, in, february, 1633, the, riksdag, of, the, estates, gave, him, the, title, gustavus, adolphus, the, great, or, gustav, adolf, den, store, in, swedish, the, only, swedish, monarch, to, be, so, honoured, as, those, vasa, princes, who, descended, from, deposed, monarchs, were, excluded, from, the, throne, and, gustavus, adolphus, s, younger, brother, had, died, ten, years, before, his, young, daughter, christina, became, his, successor, with, maria, eleonora, and, other, ministers, governing, on, her, behalf, he, left, one, other, known, child, his, illegitimate, son, gustav, count, of, vasaborg, gustavus, adolphus, is, widely, commemorated, by, protestants, in, europe, as, the, main, defender, of, their, cause, during, the, thirty, years, war, with, multiple, churches, foundations, and, other, undertakings, named, after, him, he, became, a, symbol, of, swedish, pride, and, his, name, is, attached, to, city, squares, in, major, swedish, cities, like, stockholm, gothenburg, and, helsingborg, gustavus, adolphus, day, is, celebrated, in, sweden, and, finland, each, year, on, 6, november, the, day, the, king, died, at, l, tzen, one, of, the, traditions, on, this, day, is, the, gustavus, adolphus, pastry, in, finland, the, day, is, also, celebrated, as, swedish, heritage, day, gustavus, adolphus, college, a, lutheran, college, in, st, peter, minnesota, is, also, named, for, him, the, gustav, adolf, werk, gaw, of, the, evangelical, church, in, germany, founded, on, the, bicentennial, celebration, of, the, battle, of, l, tzen, has, as, its, object, the, aid, of, other, churches, and, commemorates, gustavus, legacy, it, is, responsible, for, taking, care, of, the, diaspora, work, of, the, ekd, and, has, separate, branches, internationally, the, organization, in, austria, is, called, the, gustav, adolf, verein, the, project, of, forming, such, a, society, was, first, broached, in, connection, with, the, bicentennial, celebration, of, the, battle, of, l, tzen, on, 6, november, 1832, a, proposal, to, collect, funds, for, a, monument, to, gustavus, adolphus, was, agreed, to, and, it, was, suggested, by, superintendent, grossmann, that, the, best, memorial, to, gustavus, adolphus, would, be, the, formation, of, a, union, for, propagating, his, ideas, it, quickly, gained, popularity, in, germany, the, lack, of, political, correctness, received, some, criticism, however, the, organization, used, gaw, as, its, brand, in, the, meanwhile, the, swedish, royal, family, visited, the, gaw, headquarters, in, leipzig, on, the, 400th, birthday, of, gustavus, adolphus, in, 1994, the, columbia, encyclopedia, sums, up, his, record, the, german, socialist, franz, mehring, wrote, a, biography, of, gustavus, adolphus, with, a, marxist, perspective, on, the, actions, of, the, swedish, king, during, the, thirty, years, war, in, it, he, makes, a, case, that, the, war, was, fought, over, economics, and, trade, rather, than, religion, the, swedes, discovered, huge, deposits, of, copper, which, were, used, to, build, brass, cannon, the, cottage, industrial, growth, stimulated, an, armaments, industry, in, his, book, ofreds, r, years, of, warfare, the, swedish, historian, and, author, peter, englund, argues, that, there, was, probably, no, single, all, important, reason, for, the, king, s, decision, to, go, to, war, instead, it, was, likely, a, combination, of, religious, security, as, well, as, economic, considerations, this, view, is, supported, by, german, historian, johannes, burkhardt, who, writes, that, gustavus, entered, the, 30, years, war, exactly, 100, years, after, the, publication, of, the, confessio, augustana, the, core, confession, of, faith, of, the, lutheran, church, and, let, himself, be, praised, as, its, saviour, yet, gustavus, adolphus, s, own, manifesto, of, war, does, not, mention, any, religious, motivations, at, all, but, speaks, of, political, and, economic, reasons, sweden, would, have, to, maintain, its, integrity, in, the, face, of, several, provocations, and, aggressions, by, the, habsburg, empire, the, manifesto, was, written, by, scholar, johann, adler, salvius, in, a, style, common, of, the, time, that, promotes, a, just, war, burkhardt, argues, that, traditional, swedish, historiography, constructed, a, defensive, interest, in, security, out, of, that, by, taking, the, manifesto, s, text, for, granted, but, to, defend, stockholm, the, occupation, of, the, german, baltic, territories, would, have, been, an, extreme, advance, and, the, imperial, baltic, sea, fleet, mentioned, as, a, threat, in, the, manifesto, had, never, reached, more, than, a, quarter, of, the, size, of, the, swedish, fleet, moreover, it, was, never, maintained, to, challenge, sweden, but, to, face, the, separatist, netherlands, so, if, ruling, the, baltic, sea, was, a, goal, of, swedish, strategy, the, conquests, in, germany, were, not, a, defensive, war, but, an, act, of, expansion, from, swedish, finland, gustavus, adolphus, advanced, along, the, baltic, sea, coast, and, eventually, to, augsburg, and, munich, and, he, even, urged, the, swiss, confederacy, to, join, him, this, was, no, longer, about, baltic, interests, but, the, imperial, capital, of, vienna, and, the, alpine, passes, that, were, now, in, close, reach, of, the, swedish, army, burkhardt, points, out, that, the, gothic, legacy, of, the, swedes, coalesced, as, a, political, program, the, swedish, king, was, also, rex, gotorum, latin, king, of, the, goths, and, the, list, of, kings, was, traced, back, to, the, gothic, rulers, to, construct, continuity, prior, to, his, embarkment, to, northern, germany, gustavus, urged, the, swedish, nobility, to, follow, the, example, of, conquests, set, by, their, gothic, ancestors, had, he, lived, longer, it, would, have, been, likely, that, gustavus, had, reached, out, for, the, imperial, crown, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, swedish, composer, franz, berwald, composed, the, choral, work, gustaf, adolph, den, stores, seger, och, d, d, vid, l, tzen, gustav, adolf, the, great, s, victory, and, death, near, l, tzen, in, 1845, he, is, also, the, protagonist, of, max, bruch, s, 1898, choral, work, gustav, adolf, he, is, also, a, significant, supporting, character, in, the, best, selling, alternate, history, book, series, 1632, written, by, american, author, eric, flint, first, published, in, 2000, the, song, the, lion, from, the, north, from, the, album, carolus, rex, released, in, 2012, by, swedish, power, metal, band, sabaton, is, about, gustavus, adolphus
