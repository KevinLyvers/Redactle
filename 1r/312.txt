unitarianism, married, maria, gansevoort, who, was, committed, to, her, family, s, more, strict, and, biblically, oriented, dutch, reformed, version, of, the, calvinist, creed, the, gansevoorts, severe, protestantism, ensured, that, maria, was, well, versed, in, the, bible, in, english, as, well, as, in, dutch, the, language, that, the, gansevoorts, spoke, at, home, on, august, 19, almost, three, weeks, after, his, birth, melville, was, baptized, at, home, by, a, minister, of, the, south, reformed, dutch, church, during, the, 1820s, melville, lived, a, privileged, and, opulent, life,

allan, melvill, lived, beyond, his, means, on, large, sums, that, he, borrowed, from, his, father, and, from, his, wife, s, widowed, mother, although, his, wife, s, opinion, of, his, financial, conduct, is, unknown, biographer, hershel, parker, says, that, maria, thought, her, mother, s, money, was, infinite, and, that, she, was, entitled, to, much, of, her, portion, while, her, children, were, young, how, well, the, parents, managed, to, hide, the, truth, from, their, children, is, impossible, to, know, according, to, biographer, andrew, delbanco, in, 1830, the, gansevoorts, ended, their, financial, support, of, the, melvilles, at, which, point, allan, s, lack, of, financial, responsibility, had, left, him, in, debt, to, both, the, melvill, and, gansevoort, families, for, a, sum, exceeding, 20, 000, equivalent, to, 572, 000, in, 2023, but, melville, biographer, newton, arvin, writes, that, the, relative, happiness, and, comfort, of, melville, s, early, childhood, depended, less, on, allan, s, wealth, or, on, his, profligate, spending, as, on, the, exceptionally, tender, and, affectionate, spirit, in, all, the, family, relationships, especially, in, the, immediate, circle, arvin, describes, allan, as, a, man, of, real, sensibility, and, a, particularly, warm, and, loving, father, while, maria, was, warmly, maternal, simple, robust, and, affectionately, devoted, to, her, husband, and, her, brood, melville, s, education, began, when, he, was, six, in, 1824, the, melvills, moved, to, a, newly, built, house, at, 33, bleecker, street, in, manhattan, in, 1825, herman, and, his, brother, gansevoort, enrolled, in, new, york, male, high, school, in, 1826, the, year, that, herman, contracted, scarlet, fever, allan, melvill, described, him, as, very, backwards, in, speech, somewhat, slow, in, comprehension, at, first, but, his, development, increased, its, pace, and, allan, was, surprised, that, herman, proved, the, best, speaker, in, the, introductory, department, in, 1829, both, gansevoort, and, herman, transferred, to, columbia, grammar, and, preparatory, school, and, herman, enrolled, in, the, english, department, on, september, 28, herman, i, think, is, making, more, progress, than, formerly, allan, wrote, in, may, 1830, to, major, melvill, and, without, being, a, bright, scholar, he, maintains, a, respectable, standing, and, would, proceed, further, if, he, could, only, be, induced, to, study, more, being, a, most, amiable, and, innocent, child, i, cannot, find, it, in, my, heart, to, coerce, him, emotionally, unstable, and, behind, on, paying, the, rent, for, the, house, on, broadway, herman, s, father, tried, to, recover, by, moving, his, family, to, albany, new, york, in, 1830, and, going, into, the, fur, business, herman, attended, the, albany, academy, from, october, 1830, to, october, 1831, where, he, took, the, standard, preparatory, course, including, reading, and, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic, english, grammar, geography, natural, history, universal, greek, roman, and, english, history, classical, biography, and, jewish, antiquities, in, early, august, 1831, herman, marched, in, the, albany, city, government, procession, of, the, year, s, finest, scholars, and, was, presented, with, a, copy, of, the, london, carcanet, a, collection, of, poems, and, prose, inscribed, to, him, as, first, best, in, ciphering, books, as, melville, scholar, merton, sealts, observed, the, ubiquitous, classical, references, in, melville, s, published, writings, suggest, that, his, study, of, ancient, history, biography, and, literature, during, his, school, days, left, a, lasting, impression, on, both, his, thought, and, his, art, as, did, his, almost, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, both, the, old, and, the, new, testaments, in, october, 1831, melville, left, the, academy, while, the, precise, reason, is, not, known, definitively, parker, speculates, it, was, for, financial, reasons, since, even, the, tiny, tuition, fee, seemed, too, much, to, pay, in, december, 1831, allan, melvill, returned, from, new, york, city, by, steamboat, but, he, had, to, travel, the, last, 70, miles, in, an, open, carriage, for, two, days, and, two, nights, in, subfreezing, temperatures, in, early, january, he, began, to, show, signs, of, delirium, and, he, grew, worse, until, his, wife, felt, that, his, suffering, deprived, him, of, his, intellect, on, january, 28, 1832, he, died, two, months, prior, to, reaching, his, 50th, birthday, since, herman, was, no, longer, attending, school, he, likely, witnessed, his, father, s, medical, and, mental, deterioration, twenty, years, later, melville, described, a, similar, death, in, pierre, the, death, of, allan, caused, many, major, shifts, in, the, family, s, material, and, spiritual, circumstances, one, result, was, the, greater, influence, of, his, mother, s, religious, beliefs, maria, sought, consolation, in, her, faith, and, in, april, was, admitted, as, a, member, of, the, first, reformed, dutch, church, herman, s, saturation, in, orthodox, calvinism, was, surely, the, most, decisive, intellectual, and, spiritual, influence, of, his, early, life, two, months, after, his, father, s, death, gansevoort, entered, the, cap, and, fur, business, uncle, peter, gansevoort, a, director, of, the, new, york, state, bank, got, herman, a, job, as, clerk, for, 150, a, year, equivalent, to, 4, 600, in, 2023, biographers, cite, a, passage, from, redburn, when, trying, to, answer, what, herman, must, have, felt, then, i, had, learned, to, think, much, and, bitterly, before, my, time, the, narrator, remarks, adding, i, must, not, think, of, those, delightful, days, before, my, father, became, a, bankrupt, and, we, removed, from, the, city, for, when, i, think, of, those, days, something, rises, up, in, my, throat, and, almost, strangles, me, with, melville, arvin, argues, one, has, to, reckon, with, psychology, the, tormented, psychology, of, the, decayed, patrician, when, melville, s, paternal, grandfather, died, on, september, 16, 1832, maria, and, her, children, discovered, allan, somewhat, unscrupulously, had, borrowed, more, than, his, share, of, his, inheritance, meaning, maria, received, only, 20, equivalent, to, 600, in, 2023, his, paternal, grandmother, died, almost, exactly, seven, months, later, melville, did, his, job, well, at, the, bank, although, he, was, only, 14, in, 1834, the, bank, considered, him, competent, enough, to, be, sent, to, schenectady, new, york, on, an, errand, not, much, else, is, known, from, this, period, except, that, he, was, very, fond, of, drawing, the, visual, arts, became, a, lifelong, interest, around, may, 1834, the, melvilles, moved, to, another, house, in, albany, a, three, story, brick, house, that, same, month, a, fire, destroyed, gansevoort, s, skin, preparing, factory, which, left, him, with, personnel, he, could, neither, employ, nor, afford, instead, he, pulled, melville, out, of, the, bank, to, man, the, cap, and, fur, store, in, 1835, while, still, working, in, the, store, melville, enrolled, in, albany, classical, school, perhaps, using, maria, s, part, of, the, proceeds, from, the, sale, of, the, estate, of, his, maternal, grandmother, in, march, 1835, in, september, of, the, following, year, herman, was, back, at, the, albany, academy, participating, in, the, school, s, latin, course, he, also, participated, in, debating, societies, in, an, apparent, effort, to, make, up, as, much, as, he, could, for, his, missed, years, of, schooling, during, this, time, he, read, shakespeare, including, macbeth, whose, witch, scenes, gave, him, the, chance, to, teasingly, scare, his, sisters, by, march, 1837, however, he, again, withdrew, from, the, albany, academy, gansevoort, served, as, a, role, model, and, support, for, melville, throughout, his, life, particularly, during, this, time, trying, to, cobble, together, an, education, in, early, 1834, gansevoort, became, a, member, of, albany, s, young, men, s, association, for, mutual, improvement, and, in, january, 1835, melville, joined, him, there, gansevoort, also, had, copies, of, john, todd, s, index, rerum, a, blank, register, for, indexing, remarkable, passages, from, books, one, had, read, for, easy, retrieval, among, the, sample, entries, that, gansevoort, made, showing, his, academic, scrupulousness, was, pequot, beautiful, description, of, the, war, with, with, a, short, title, reference, to, the, place, in, benjamin, trumbull, s, a, complete, history, of, connecticut, volume, i, in, 1797, and, volume, ii, in, 1818, in, which, the, description, could, be, found, the, two, surviving, volumes, of, gansevoort, s, are, the, best, evidence, for, melville, s, reading, in, this, period, gansevoort, s, entries, include, books, melville, used, for, moby, dick, and, clarel, including, parsees, of, india, an, excellent, description, of, their, character, and, religion, and, an, account, of, their, descent, east, india, sketch, book, p, 21, other, entries, are, on, panther, the, pirate, s, cabin, and, storm, at, sea, from, james, fenimore, cooper, s, the, red, rover, the, panic, of, 1837, forced, gansevoort, to, file, for, bankruptcy, in, april, in, june, maria, told, the, younger, children, they, needed, to, leave, albany, for, somewhere, cheaper, gansevoort, began, studying, law, in, new, york, city, while, herman, managed, the, farm, before, getting, a, teaching, position, at, sikes, district, school, near, lenox, massachusetts, he, taught, about, 30, students, of, various, ages, including, some, his, own, age, the, semester, over, he, returned, to, his, mother, in, 1838, in, february, he, was, elected, president, of, the, philo, logos, society, which, peter, gansevoort, invited, to, move, into, stanwix, hall, for, no, rent, in, the, albany, microscope, in, march, melville, published, two, polemical, letters, about, issues, in, vogue, in, the, debating, societies, historians, leon, howard, and, hershel, parker, suggest, the, motive, behind, the, letters, was, a, youthful, desire, to, have, his, rhetorical, skills, publicly, recognized, in, may, the, melvilles, moved, to, a, rented, house, in, lansingburgh, almost, 12, miles, north, of, albany, nothing, is, known, about, what, melville, did, or, where, he, went, for, several, months, after, he, finished, teaching, at, sikes, on, november, 12, five, days, after, arriving, in, lansingburgh, melville, paid, for, a, term, at, lansingburgh, academy, to, study, surveying, and, engineering, in, an, april, 1839, letter, recommending, herman, for, a, job, in, the, engineer, department, of, the, erie, canal, peter, gansevoort, says, his, nephew, possesses, the, ambition, to, make, himself, useful, in, a, business, which, he, desires, to, make, his, profession, but, no, job, resulted, just, weeks, after, this, failure, melville, s, first, known, published, essay, appeared, using, the, initials, l, a, v, herman, contributed, fragments, from, a, writing, desk, to, the, weekly, newspaper, democratic, press, and, lansingburgh, advertiser, which, printed, it, in, two, installments, the, first, on, may, 4, according, to, merton, sealts, his, use, of, heavy, handed, allusions, reveals, familiarity, with, the, work, of, william, shakespeare, john, milton, walter, scott, richard, brinsley, sheridan, edmund, burke, samuel, taylor, coleridge, lord, byron, and, thomas, moore, parker, calls, the, piece, characteristic, melvillean, mood, stuff, and, considers, its, style, excessive, enough, to, indulge, his, extravagances, and, just, enough, overdone, to, allow, him, to, deny, that, he, was, taking, his, style, seriously, for, delbanco, the, style, is, overheated, in, the, manner, of, poe, with, sexually, charged, echoes, of, byron, and, the, arabian, nights, on, may, 31, 1839, gansevoort, then, living, in, new, york, city, wrote, that, he, was, sure, herman, could, get, a, job, on, a, whaler, or, merchant, vessel, the, next, day, he, signed,

jacket, 1850, melville, s, fifth, book, melville, s, wander, years, created, what, biographer, arvin, calls, a, settled, hatred, of, external, authority, a, lust, for, personal, freedom, and, a, growing, and, intensifying, sense, of, his, own, exceptionalism, as, a, person, along, with, the, resentful, sense, that, circumstance, and, mankind, together, had, already, imposed, their, will, upon, him, in, a, series, of, injurious, ways, scholar, robert, milder, believes, the, encounter, with, the, wide, ocean, where, he, was, seemingly, abandoned, by, god, led, melville, to, experience, a, metaphysical, estrangement, and, influenced, his, social, views, in, two, ways, first, that, he, belonged, to, the, genteel, classes, but, sympathized, with, the, disinherited, commons, he, had, been, placed, among, and, second, that, experiencing, the, cultures, of, polynesia, let, him, view, the, west, from, an, outsider, s, perspective, upon, his, return, melville, regaled, his, family, and, friends, with, his, adventurous, tales, and, romantic, experiences, and, they, urged, him, to, put, them, into, writing, melville, completed, typee, his, first, book, in, the, summer, of, 1845, while, living, in, troy, new, york, his, brother, gansevoort, found, a, publisher, for, it, in, london, where, it, was, published, in, february, 1846, by, john, murray, in, his, travel, adventure, series, it, became, an, overnight, bestseller, in, england, then, in, new, york, when, it, was, published, on, march, 17, by, wiley, putnam, in, the, narrative, melville, likely, extended, the, period, of, time, he, had, spent, on, the, island, and, also, incorporated, material, from, source, books, he, had, assembled, milder, calls, typee, an, appealing, mixture, of, adventure, anecdote, ethnography, and, social, criticism, presented, with, a, genial, latitudinarianism, that, gave, novelty, to, a, south, sea, idyll, at, once, erotically, suggestive, and, romantically, chaste, an, unsigned, review, in, the, salem, advertiser, written, by, nathaniel, hawthorne, called, the, book, a, skilfully, managed, narrative, by, an, author, with, that, freedom, of, view, which, renders, him, tolerant, of, codes, of, morals, that, may, be, little, in, accordance, with, our, own, hawthorne, continued, this, book, is, lightly, but, vigorously, written, and, we, are, acquainted, with, no, work, that, gives, a, freer, and, more, effective, picture, of, barbarian, life, in, that, unadulterated, state, of, which, there, are, now, so, few, specimens, remaining, the, gentleness, of, disposition, that, seems, akin, to, the, delicious, climate, is, shown, in, contrast, with, the, traits, of, savage, fierceness, he, has, that, freedom, of, view, it, would, be, too, harsh, to, call, it, laxity, of, principle, which, renders, him, tolerant, of, codes, of, morals, that, may, be, little, in, accordance, with, our, own, a, spirit, proper, enough, to, a, young, and, adventurous, sailor, and, which, makes, his, book, the, more, wholesome, to, our, staid, landsmen, pleased, but, not, overwhelmed, by, the, adulation, of, his, new, public, melville, later, expressed, concern, that, he, would, go, down, to, posterity, as, a, man, who, lived, among, the, cannibals, the, writing, of, typee, brought, melville, back, into, contact, with, his, friend, greene, toby, in, the, book, who, wrote, confirming, melville, s, account, in, newspapers, the, two, corresponded, until, 1863, and, in, his, final, years, melville, traced, and, successfully, located, his, old, friend, for, a, further, meeting, of, the, two, in, march, 1847, omoo, a, sequel, to, typee, was, published, by, murray, in, london, and, in, may, by, harper, in, new, york, omoo, is, a, slighter, but, more, professional, book, according, to, milder, typee, and, omoo, gave, melville, overnight, renown, as, a, writer, and, adventurer, and, he, often, entertained, by, telling, stories, to, his, admirers, as, the, writer, and, editor, nathaniel, parker, willis, wrote, with, his, cigar, and, his, spanish, eyes, he, talks, typee, and, omoo, just, as, you, find, the, flow, of, his, delightful, mind, on, paper, in, 1847, melville, tried, unsuccessfully, to, find, a, government, job, in, washington, in, june, 1847, melville, and, elizabeth, lizzie, knapp, shaw, were, engaged, after, knowing, each, other, for, approximately, three, months, melville, had, first, asked, her, father, lemuel, shaw, for, her, hand, in, march, but, was, at, first, turned, down, at, the, time, shaw, chief, justice, of, massachusetts, had, been, a, close, friend, of, melville, s, father, and, shaw, s, marriage, with, melville, s, aunt, nancy, was, prevented, only, by, her, death, his, warmth, and, financial, support, for, the, family, continued, after, allan, s, death, melville, dedicated, his, first, book, typee, to, him, lizzie, was, raised, by, her, grandmother, and, an, irish, nurse, arvin, suggests, that, melville, s, interest, in, lizzie, may, have, been, stimulated, by, his, need, of, judge, shaw, s, paternal, presence, they, were, married, on, august, 4, 1847, lizzie, described, their, marriage, as, very, unexpected, and, scarcely, thought, of, until, about, two, months, before, it, actually, took, place, she, wanted, to, be, married, in, church, but, they, had, a, private, wedding, ceremony, at, home, to, avoid, possible, crowds, hoping, to, see, the, celebrity, the, couple, honeymooned, in, the, then, british, province, of, canada, and, traveled, to, montreal, they, settled, in, a, house, on, fourth, avenue, in, new, york, city, now, called, park, avenue, according, to, scholars, joyce, deveau, kennedy, and, frederick, james, kennedy, lizzie, brought, to, their, marriage, a, sense, of, religious, obligation, an, intent, to, make, a, home, with, melville, regardless, of, place, a, willingness, to, please, her, husband, by, performing, such, tasks, of, drudgery, as, mending, stockings, an, ability, to, hide, her, agitation, and, a, desire, to, shield, melville, from, unpleasantness, the, kennedys, conclude, that, if, the, ensuing, years, did, bring, regrets, to, melville, s, life, it, is, impossible, to, believe, he, would, have, regretted, marrying, elizabeth, in, fact, he, must, have, realized, that, he, could, not, have, borne, the, weight, of, those, years, unaided, that, without, her, loyalty, intelligence, and, affection, his, own, wild, imagination, would, have, had, no, port, or, haven, biographer, robertson, lorant, cites, lizzie, s, adventurous, spirit, and, abundant, energy, and, she, suggests, that, her, pluck, and, good, humor, might, have, been, what, attracted, melville, to, her, and, vice, versa, an, example, of, such, good, humor, appears, in, a, letter, about, her, not, yet, used, to, being, married, it, seems, sometimes, exactly, as, if, i, were, here, for, a, visit, the, illusion, is, quite, dispelled, however, when, herman, stalks, into, my, room, without, even, the, ceremony, of, knocking, bringing, me, perhaps, a, button, to, sew, on, or, some, equally, romantic, occupation, on, february, 16, 1849, the, melvilles, first, child, malcolm, was, born, in, march, 1848, mardi, was, published, by, richard, bentley, in, london, and, in, april, by, harper, in, new, york, nathaniel, hawthorne, thought, it, a, rich, book, with, depths, here, and, there, that, compel, a, man, to, swim, for, his, life, according, to, milder, the, book, began, as, another, south, sea, story, but, as, he, wrote, melville, left, that, genre, behind, first, in, favor, of, a, romance, of, the, narrator, taji, and, the, lost, maiden, yillah, and, then, to, an, allegorical, voyage, of, the, philosopher, babbalanja, and, his, companions, through, the, imaginary, archipelago, of, mardi, in, october, 1849, redburn, was, published, by, bentley, in, london, and, in, november, by, harper, in, new, york, the, bankruptcy, and, death, of, allan, melvill, and, melville, s, own, youthful, humiliations, surface, in, this, story, of, outward, adaptation, and, inner, impairment, biographer, robertson, lorant, regards, the, work, as, a, deliberate, attempt, for, popular, appeal, melville, modeled, each, episode, almost, systematically, on, every, genre, that, was, popular, with, some, group, of, antebellum, readers, combining, elements, of, the, picaresque, novel, the, travelogue, the, nautical, adventure, the, sentimental, novel, the, sensational, french, romance, the, gothic, thriller, temperance, tracts, urban, reform, literature, and, the, english, pastoral, his, next, novel, white, jacket, was, published, by, bentley, in, london, in, january, 1850, and, in, march, by, harper, in, new, york, the, earliest, surviving, mention, of, moby, dick, is, from, a, may, 1, 1850, letter, in, which, melville, told, fellow, sea, author, richard, henry, dana, jr, i, am, half, way, in, the, work, in, june, he, described, the, book, to, his, english, publisher, as, a, romance, of, adventure, founded, upon, certain, wild, legends, in, the, southern, sperm, whale, fisheries, and, promised, it, would, be, done, by, the, fall, the, original, manuscript, has, not, survived, that, summer, melville, read, thomas, carlyle, borrowing, copies, of, sartor, resartus, 1833, 34, and, on, heroes, hero, worship, the, heroic, in, history, 1841, from, the, library, of, his, friend, evert, duyckinck, these, readings, proved, significant, occurring, as, melville, radically, transformed, his, initial, plan, for, the, novel, over, the, next, several, months, conceiving, what, delbanco, described, in, 2005, as, the, most, ambitious, book, ever, conceived, by, an, american, writer, from, august, 4, to, 12, 1850, the, melvilles, sarah, morewood, duyckinck, oliver, wendell, holmes, and, other, literary, figures, from, new, york, city, and, boston, came, to, pittsfield, massachusetts, to, enjoy, a, period, of, parties, picnics, and, dinners, nathaniel, hawthorne, and, his, publisher, james, t, fields, joined, the, group, while, hawthorne, s, wife, stayed, at, home, to, look, after, the, children, on, one, picnic, outing, organized, by, duyckinck, hawthorne, and, melville, sought, shelter, from, the, rain, together, and, had, a, deep, private, conversation, melville, had, been, given, a, copy, of, hawthorne, s, short, story, collection, mosses, from, an, old, manse, though, he, had, not, yet, read, it, melville, then, avidly, read, it, and, wrote, a, review, hawthorne, and, his, mosses, which, appeared, in, two, installments, on, august, 17, and, 24, in, the, literary, world, melville, wrote, that, these, stories, revealed, a, dark, side, to, hawthorne, shrouded, in, blackness, ten, times, black, he, repeatedly, compared, hawthorne, to, shakespeare, and, urged, that, men, not, very, much, inferior, to, shakespeare, are, this, day, being, born, on, the, banks, of, the, ohio, the, critic, walter, bezanson, finds, the, essay, so, deeply, related, to, melville, s, imaginative, and, intellectual, world, while, writing, moby, dick, that, it, could, be, regarded, as, a, virtual, preface, and, should, be, everybody, s, prime, piece, of, contextual, reading, later, that, summer, duyckinck, sent, hawthorne, copies, of, melville, s, three, most, recent, books, hawthorne, read, them, as, he, wrote, to, duyckinck, on, august, 29, that, melville, in, redburn, and, white, jacket, put, the, reality, more, unflinchingly, before, his, reader, than, any, writer, and, he, thought, mardi, was, a, rich, book, with, depths, here, and, there, that, compel, a, man, to, swim, for, his, life, but, he, cautioned, it, is, so, good, that, one, scarcely, pardons, the, writer, for, not, having, brooded, long, over, it, so, as, to, make, it, a, great, deal, better, in, september, 1850, melville, borrowed, three, thousand, dollars, from, his, father, in, law, lemuel, shaw, to, buy, a, 160, acre, farm, in, pittsfield, melville, called, his, new, home, arrowhead, because, of, the, arrowheads, that, were, dug, up, around, the, property, during, planting, season, that, winter, melville, paid, hawthorne, an, unexpected, visit, only, to, discover, he, was, working, and, not, in, the, mood, for, company, hawthorne, s, wife, sophia, gave, him, copies, of, twice, told, tales, and, for, malcolm, the, grandfather, s, chair, melville, invited, them, to, visit, arrowhead, soon, hoping, to, the, universe, with, a, bottle, of, brandy, cigars, with, hawthorne, but, hawthorne, would, not, stop, working, on, his, new, book, for, more, than, one, day, and, they, did, not, come, after, a, second, visit, from, melville, hawthorne, surprised, him, by, arriving, at, arrowhead, with, his, daughter, una, according, to, robertson, lorant, the, handsome, hawthorne, made, quite, an, impression, on, the, melville, women, especially, augusta, who, was, a, great, fan, of, his, books, they, spent, the, day, mostly, smoking, and, talking, metaphysics, robertson, lorant, writes, that, melville, was, infatuated, with, hawthorne, s, intellect, captivated, by, his, artistry, and, charmed, by, his, elusive, personality, but, the, friendship, meant, something, different, to, each, of, them, with, hawthorne, offering, melville, the, kind, of, intellectual, stimulation, he, needed, they, may, have, been, natural, allies, and, friends, yet, they, were, also, fifteen, years, apart, in, age, and, temperamentally, quite, different, and, hawthorne, found, melville, s, manic, intensity, exhausting, at, times, bezanson, identifies, sexual, excitement, in, all, the, ten, letters, melville, wrote, to, the, older, man, in, the, essay, on, hawthorne, s, mosses, melville, wrote, i, feel, that, this, hawthorne, has, dropped, germinous, seeds, into, my, soul, he, expands, and, deepens, down, the, more, i, contemplate, him, and, further, and, further, shoots, his, strong, new, england, roots, into, the, hot, soil, of, my, southern, soul, melville, dedicated, his, book, to, hawthorne, in, token, of, my, admiration, for, his, genius, this, book, is, inscribed, to, nathaniel, hawthorne, on, october, 18, 1851, the, whale, was, published, in, britain, in, three, volumes, and, on, november, 14, moby, dick, appeared, in, the, united, states, as, a, single, volume, in, between, these, dates, on, october, 22, 1851, the, melvilles, second, child, stanwix, was, born, in, december, hawthorne, told, duyckinck, what, a, book, melville, has, written, it, gives, me, an, idea, of, much, greater, power, than, his, preceding, ones, unlike, other, contemporaneous, reviewers, of, melville, hawthorne, had, seen, the, uniqueness, of, melville, s, new, novel, and, acknowledged, it, in, early, december, 1852, melville, visited, the, hawthornes, in, concord, and, discussed, the, idea, of, the, agatha, story, he, had, talked, of, with, hawthorne, this, was, the, last, contact, between, the, two, writers, before, melville, visited, hawthorne, in, liverpool, four, years, later, when, hawthorne, had, relocated, to, england, after, having, borrowed, three, thousand, dollars, from, his, father, in, law, in, september, 1850, to, buy, a, 160, acre, farm, in, pittsfield, massachusetts, melville, had, high, hopes, that, his, next, book, would, please, the, public, and, restore, his, finances, in, april, 1851, he, told, his, british, publisher, richard, bentley, that, his, new, book, had, unquestionable, novelty, and, was, calculated, to, have, wide, appeal, with, elements, of, romance, and, mystery, in, fact, pierre, or, the, ambiguities, was, heavily, psychological, though, drawing, on, the, conventions, of, the, romance, and, difficult, in, style, it, was, not, well, received, the, new, york, day, book, published, a, venomous, attack, on, september, 8, 1852, headlined, herman, melville, crazy, the, item, offered, as, a, news, story, reported, a, critical, friend, who, read, melville, s, last, book, ambiguities, between, two, steamboat, accidents, told, us, that, it, appeared, to, be, composed, of, the, ravings, and, reveries, of, a, madman, we, were, somewhat, startled, at, the, remark, but, still, more, at, learning, a, few, days, after, that, melville, was, really, supposed, to, be, deranged, and, that, his, friends, were, taking, measures, to, place, him, under, treatment, we, hope, one, of, the, earliest, precautions, will, be, to, keep, him, stringently, secluded, from, pen, and, ink, on, may, 22, 1853, melville, s, third, child, and, first, daughter, elizabeth, bessie, was, born, and, on, or, about, that, day, herman, finished, work, on, the, agatha, story, isle, of, the, cross, melville, traveled, to, new, york, to, discuss, a, book, presumably, isle, of, the, cross, with, his, publisher, but, later, wrote, that, harper, brothers, was, prevented, from, publishing, his, manuscript, because, it, was, lost, after, the, commercial, and, critical, failure, of, pierre, melville, had, difficulty, finding, a, publisher, for, his, follow, up, novel, israel, potter, instead, this, narrative, of, a, revolutionary, war, veteran, was, serialized, in, putnam, s, monthly, magazine, in, 1853, from, november, 1853, to, 1856, melville, published, fourteen, tales, and, sketches, in, putnam, s, and, harper, s, magazines, in, december, 1855, he, proposed, to, dix, edwards, the, new, owners, of, putnam, s, that, they, publish, a, selective, collection, of, the, short, fiction, the, collection, titled, the, piazza, tales, was, named, after, a, new, introductory, story, melville, wrote, for, it, the, piazza, it, also, contained, five, previously, published, stories, including, bartleby, the, scrivener, and, benito, cereno, on, march, 2, 1855, the, melvilles, fourth, child, frances, fanny, was, born, in, this, period, his, book, israel, potter, was, published, the, writing, of, the, confidence, man, put, great, strain, on, melville, leading, sam, shaw, a, nephew, of, lizzie, to, write, to, his, uncle, lemuel, shaw, herman, i, hope, has, had, no, more, of, those, ugly, attacks, a, reference, to, what, robertson, lorant, calls, the, bouts, of, rheumatism, and, sciatica, that, plagued, melville, melville, s, father, in, law, apparently, shared, his, daughter, s, great, anxiety, about, him, when, he, wrote, a, letter, to, a, cousin, in, which, he, described, melville, s, working, habits, when, he, is, deeply, engaged, in, one, of, his, literary, works, he, confines, him, to, hard, study, many, hours, in, the, day, with, little, or, no, exercise, and, this, specially, in, winter, for, a, great, many, days, together, he, probably, thus, overworks, himself, and, brings, on, severe, nervous, affections, shaw, advanced, melville, 1, 500, from, lizzie, s, inheritance, to, travel, four, or, five, months, in, europe, and, the, holy, land, from, october, 11, 1856, to, may, 20, 1857, melville, made, a, six, month, grand, tour, of, europe, and, the, mediterranean, while, in, england, in, november, 1856, he, briefly, reunited, for, three, days, with, hawthorne, who, had, taken, the, position, of, united, states, consul, at, liverpool, at, that, time, the, hub, of, britain, s, atlantic, trade, at, the, nearby, coast, resort, of, southport, amid, the, sand, dunes, where, they, had, stopped, to, smoke, cigars, they, had, a, conversation, that, hawthorne, later, described, in, his, journal, melville, as, he, always, does, began, to, reason, of, providence, and, futurity, and, of, everything, that, lies, beyond, human, ken, and, informed, me, that, he, pretty, much, made, up, his, mind, to, be, annihilated, if, he, were, a, religious, man, he, would, be, one, of, the, most, truly, religious, and, reverential, he, has, a, very, high, and, noble, nature, and, better, worth, immortality, than, most, of, us, the, mediterranean, part, of, the, tour, took, in, the, holy, land, which, inspired, his, epic, poem, clarel, during, the, tour, he, visited, mount, hope, a, christian, farm, near, jaffa, on, april, 1, 1857, melville, published, his, last, full, length, novel, the, confidence, man, this, novel, subtitled, his, masquerade, has, won, general, acclaim, in, modern, times, as, a, complex, and, mysterious, exploration, of, issues, of, fraud, and, honesty, identity, and, masquerade, however, when, it, was, published, it, received, reviews, ranging, from, the, bewildered, to, the, denunciatory, to, repair, his, faltering, finances, melville, took, up, public, lecturing, from, late, 1857, to, 1860, he, embarked, upon, three, lecture, tours, and, spoke, at, lyceums, chiefly, on, roman, statuary, and, sightseeing, in, rome, melville, s, lectures, which, mocked, the, pseudo, intellectualism, of, lyceum, culture, were, panned, by, contemporary, audiences, on, may, 30, 1860, melville, boarded, the, clipper, meteor, for, california, with, his, brother, thomas, at, the, helm, after, a, shaky, trip, around, cape, horn, melville, returned, to, new, york, alone, via, panama, in, november, later, that, year, he, submitted, a, poetry, collection, to, a, publisher, but, it, was, not, accepted, and, is, now, lost, in, 1863, he, bought, his, brother, s, house, at, 104, east, 26th, street, in, new, york, city, and, moved, there, in, 1864, melville, visited, the, virginia, battlefields, of, the, american, civil, war, after, the, war, he, published, battle, pieces, and, aspects, of, the, war, 1866, a, collection, of, 72, poems, that, has, been, described, as, a, polyphonic, verse, journal, of, the, conflict, the, work, did, not, do, well, commercially, of, the, print, run, of, 1, 260, copies, 300, were, sent, as, review, copies, and, 551, copies, were, sold, and, reviewers, did, not, realize, that, melville, had, purposely, avoided, the, ostentatious, diction, and, fine, writing, that, were, in, fashion, choosing, to, be, concise, and, spare, in, 1866, melville, became, a, customs, inspector, for, new, york, city, he, held, the, post, for, 19, years, and, had, a, reputation, for, honesty, in, a, notoriously, corrupt, institution, unbeknownst, to, melville, his, position, was, sometimes, protected, by, future, american, president, chester, a, arthur, then, a, customs, official, who, admired, melville, s, writing, but, never, spoke, to, him, during, these, years, melville, suffered, from, nervous, exhaustion, physical, pain, and, frustration, and, would, sometimes, in, the, words, of, robertson, lorant, behave, like, the, tyrannical, captains, he, had, portrayed, in, his, novels, perhaps, even, beating, his, wife, lizzie, when, he, came, home, after, drinking, in, 1867, malcolm, the, melvilles, older, son, died, in, his, bedroom, at, home, at, the, age, of, 18, from, a, self, inflicted, gun, shot, perhaps, intentional, perhaps, accidental, in, may, 1867, lizzie, s, brother, sam, who, shared, his, family, s, fear, for, melville, s, sanity, tried, to, arrange, for, her, to, leave, melville, lizzie, was, to, visit, her, family, in, boston, and, assert, to, a, court, that, her, husband, was, insane, but, lizzie, whether, to, avoid, the, social, shame, divorce, carried, at, the, time, or, because, she, still, loved, her, husband, refused, to, go, along, with, the, plan, though, melville, s, professional, writing, career, had, ended, he, remained, dedicated, to, his, writing, he, spent, years, on, what, milder, called, his, autumnal, masterpiece, clarel, a, poem, and, a, pilgrimage, 1876, an, 18, 000, line, epic, poem, inspired, by, his, 1856, trip, to, the, holy, land, it, is, among, the, longest, single, poems, in, american, literature, the, title, character, is, a, young, american, student, of, divinity, who, travels, to, jerusalem, to, renew, his, faith, one, of, the, central, characters, rolfe, is, similar, to, melville, in, his, younger, days, a, seeker, and, adventurer, while, the, reclusive, vine, is, loosely, based, on, hawthorne, who, had, died, twelve, years, before, publication, of, 350, copies, was, funded, with, a, bequest, from, his, uncle, in, 1876, but, sales, failed, miserably, and, the, unsold, copies, were, burned, when, melville, was, unable, to, buy, them, at, cost, critic, lewis, mumford, found, an, unread, copy, in, the, new, york, public, library, in, 1925, with, its, pages, uncut, melville, s, own, income, remained, limited, but, in, 1884, lizzie, received, a, legacy, that, enabled, him, to, buy, a, steady, stream, of, books, and, prints, each, month, melville, retired, on, december, 31, 1885, after, several, of, his, wife, s, relatives, further, supported, the, couple, with, supplementary, legacies, and, inheritances, on, february, 22, 1886, stanwix, their, younger, son, died, in, san, francisco, at, age, 36, from, tuberculosis, in, 1889, melville, became, a, member, of, the, new, york, society, library, melville, had, a, modest, revival, of, popularity, in, england, when, readers, rediscovered, his, novels, he, published, two, collections, of, poems, inspired, by, his, early, experiences, at, sea, with, prose, head, notes, intended, for, his, relatives, and, friends, each, had, a, print, run, of, 25, copies, the, first, john, marr, and, other, sailors, was, published, in, 1888, followed, by, timoleon, in, 1891, melville, died, on, the, morning, of, september, 28, 1891, his, death, certificate, shows, cardiac, dilation, as, the, cause, he, was, interred, in, the, woodlawn, cemetery, in, bronx, new, york, city, the, new, york, times, initial, death, notice, called, his, masterpiece, mobie, dick, the, misspelling, of, which, was, later, erroneously, taken, to, mean, that, he, was, unappreciated, at, his, time, of, death, but, there, were, some, appreciations, the, times, for, instance, published, a, substantial, article, of, appreciation, on, october, 2, the, author, said, that, thinking, back, to, melville, s, books, that, were, so, much, read, forty, years, earlier, there, is, no, difficulty, determining, why, they, were, then, read, and, talked, about, but, the, difficulty, is, to, discover, why, they, are, read, and, talked, about, no, longer, melville, left, a, volume, of, poetry, weeds, and, wildings, and, a, sketch, daniel, orme, unpublished, at, the, time, of, his, death, his, wife, also, found, pages, for, an, unfinished, novella, titled, billy, budd, melville, had, revised, and, rearranged, the, manuscript, in, several, stages, leaving, the, pages, in, disarray, lizzie, could, not, decide, her, husband, s, intentions, or, even, read, his, handwriting, in, some, places, and, abandoned, attempts, to, edit, the, manuscript, for, publication, the, pages, were, stored, in, a, family, breadbox, until, 1919, when, melville, s, granddaughter, gave, them, to, raymond, weaver, weaver, who, initially, dismissed, the, work, s, importance, published, a, quick, transcription, in, 1924, this, version, however, contained, many, misreadings, some, of, which, affected, interpretation, it, was, an, immediate, critical, success, in, england, then, in, the, united, states, in, 1962, the, melville, scholars, harrison, hayford, and, merton, m, sealts, published, a, critical, reading, text, that, was, widely, accepted, it, was, adapted, as, a, stage, play, on, broadway, in, 1951, then, an, opera, and, in, 1961, as, a, film, melville, s, writing, style, shows, both, consistencies, and, enormous, changes, throughout, the, years, his, development, had, been, abnormally, postponed, and, when, it, came, it, came, with, a, rush, and, a, force, that, had, the, menace, of, quick, exhaustion, in, it, as, early, as, fragments, from, a, writing, desk, written, when, melville, was, 20, scholar, sealts, sees, a, number, of, elements, that, anticipate, melville, s, later, writing, especially, his, characteristic, habit, of, abundant, literary, allusion, typee, and, omoo, were, documentary, adventures, that, called, for, a, division, of, the, narrative, in, short, chapters, such, compact, organization, bears, the, risk, of, fragmentation, when, applied, to, a, lengthy, work, such, as, mardi, but, with, redburn, and, white, jacket, melville, turned, the, short, chapter, into, a, concentrated, narrative, some, chapters, of, moby, dick, are, no, more, than, two, pages, in, standard, editions, and, an, extreme, example, is, chapter, 122, consisting, of, a, single, paragraph, of, 36, words, the, skillful, handling, of, chapters, in, moby, dick, is, one, of, the, most, fully, developed, melvillean, signatures, and, is, a, measure, of, his, masterly, writing, style, something, that, would, lend, lasting, significance, to, the, opening, lines, call, me, ishmael, individual, chapters, have, become, a, touchstone, for, appreciation, of, melville, s, art, and, for, explanation, of, his, themes, in, contrast, the, chapters, in, pierre, called, books, are, divided, into, short, numbered, sections, seemingly, an, odd, formal, compromise, between, melville, s, natural, length, and, his, purpose, to, write, a, regular, romance, that, called, for, longer, chapters, as, satirical, elements, were, introduced, the, chapter, arrangement, restores, some, degree, of, organization, and, pace, from, the, chaos, the, usual, chapter, unit, then, reappears, for, israel, potter, the, confidence, man, and, even, clarel, but, only, becomes, a, vital, part, in, the, whole, creative, achievement, again, in, the, juxtaposition, of, accents, and, of, topics, in, billy, budd, newton, arvin, points, out, that, only, superficially, the, books, after, mardi, seem, as, if, melville, s, writing, went, back, to, the, vein, of, his, first, two, books, in, reality, his, movement, was, not, a, retrograde, but, a, spiral, one, and, while, redburn, and, white, jacket, may, lack, the, spontaneous, youthful, charm, of, his, first, two, books, they, are, denser, in, substance, richer, in, feeling, tauter, more, complex, more, connotative, in, texture, and, imagery, the, rhythm, of, the, prose, in, omoo, achieves, little, more, than, easiness, the, language, is, almost, neutral, and, without, idiosyncrasy, while, redburn, shows, an, improved, ability, in, narrative, which, fuses, imagery, and, emotion, melville, s, early, works, were, increasingly, baroque, in, style, and, with, moby, dick, melville, s, vocabulary, had, grown, superabundant, walter, bezanson, calls, it, an, immensely, varied, style, according, to, critic, warner, berthoff, three, characteristic, uses, of, language, can, be, recognized, first, the, exaggerated, repetition, of, words, as, in, the, series, pitiable, pity, pitied, and, piteous, ch, 81, the, pequod, meets, the, virgin, a, second, typical, device, is, the, use, of, unusual, adjective, noun, combinations, as, in, concentrating, brow, and, immaculate, manliness, ch, 26, knights, and, squires, a, third, characteristic, is, the, presence, of, a, participial, modifier, to, emphasize, and, to, reinforce, the, already, established, expectations, of, the, reader, as, the, words, preluding, and, foreshadowing, so, still, and, subdued, and, yet, somehow, preluding, was, all, the, scene, in, this, foreshadowing, interval, i, tell, you, it, will, be, more, tolerable, for, the, feegee, that, salted, down, a, lean, missionary, in, his, cellar, against, a, coming, famine, it, will, be, more, tolerable, for, that, provident, feegee, i, say, in, the, day, of, judgment, than, for, thee, civilized, and, enlightened, gourmand, who, nailest, geese, to, the, ground, and, feastest, on, their, bloated, livers, in, thy, pat, de, foie, gras, melville, paraphrases, the, bible, in, the, whale, as, a, dish, moby, dick, chapter, 65, after, his, use, of, hyphenated, compounds, in, pierre, melville, s, writing, gives, berthoff, the, impression, of, becoming, less, exploratory, and, less, provocative, in, his, choices, of, words, and, phrases, instead, of, providing, a, lead, into, possible, meanings, and, openings, out, of, the, material, in, hand, the, vocabulary, now, served, to, crystallize, governing, impressions, the, diction, no, longer, attracted, attention, to, itself, except, as, an, effort, at, exact, definition, the, language, berthoff, continues, reflects, a, controlling, intelligence, of, right, judgment, and, completed, understanding, the, sense, of, free, inquiry, and, exploration, that, infused, his, earlier, writing, and, accounted, for, its, rare, force, and, expansiveness, tended, to, give, way, to, static, enumeration, by, comparison, to, the, verbal, music, and, kinetic, energy, of, moby, dick, melville, s, subsequent, writings, seem, relatively, muted, even, withheld, in, his, later, works, melville, s, paragraphing, in, his, best, work, berthoff, considers, to, be, the, virtuous, result, of, compactness, of, form, and, free, assembling, of, unanticipated, further, data, such, as, when, the, mysterious, sperm, whale, is, compared, with, exodus, s, invisibility, of, god, s, face, in, the, final, paragraph, of, chapter, 86, the, tail, over, time, melville, s, paragraphs, became, shorter, as, his, sentences, grew, longer, until, he, arrived, at, the, one, sentence, paragraphing, characteristic, of, his, later, prose, berthoff, points, to, the, opening, chapter, of, the, confidence, man, for, an, example, as, it, counts, fifteen, paragraphs, seven, of, which, consist, of, only, one, elaborate, sentence, and, four, that, have, only, two, sentences, the, use, of, similar, technique, in, billy, budd, contributes, in, large, part, berthoff, says, to, its, remarkable, narrative, economy, verily, i, say, unto, you, it, shall, be, more, tolerable, for, the, land, of, sodom, and, gomorrah, in, the, day, of, judgment, than, for, that, city, matthew, 10, 15, in, nathalia, wright, s, view, melville, s, sentences, generally, have, a, looseness, of, structure, easy, to, use, for, devices, as, catalogue, and, allusion, parallel, and, refrain, proverb, and, allegory, the, length, of, his, clauses, may, vary, greatly, but, the, narrative, style, of, writing, in, pierre, and, the, confidence, man, is, there, to, convey, feeling, not, thought, unlike, henry, james, who, was, an, innovator, of, sentence, ordering, to, render, the, subtlest, nuances, in, thought, melville, made, few, such, innovations, his, domain, is, the, mainstream, of, english, prose, with, its, rhythm, and, simplicity, influenced, by, the, king, james, bible, another, important, characteristic, of, melville, s, writing, style, is, in, its, echoes, and, overtones, melville, s, imitation, of, certain, distinct, styles, is, responsible, for, this, his, three, most, important, sources, in, order, are, the, bible, shakespeare, and, milton, direct, quotation, from, any, of, the, sources, is, slight, only, one, sixth, of, his, biblical, allusions, can, be, qualified, as, such, because, melville, adapts, biblical, usage, to, his, own, narrated, textual, requirements, of, clarifying, his, plot, the, biblical, elements, in, melville, s, style, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, in, the, first, allusion, is, more, within, the, narrative, rather, than, formal, quotation, several, preferred, biblical, allusions, appear, repeatedly, throughout, his, body, of, work, taking, on, the, nature, of, refrains, examples, are, the, injunctions, to, be, as, wise, as, serpents, and, as, harmless, as, doves, death, on, a, pale, horse, the, man, of, sorrows, the, many, mansions, of, heaven, proverbs, as, the, hairs, on, our, heads, are, numbered, pride, goes, before, a, fall, the, wages, of, sin, is, death, adverbs, and, pronouns, as, verily, whoso, forasmuch, as, phrases, as, come, to, pass, children, s, children, the, fat, of, the, land, vanity, of, vanities, outer, darkness, the, apple, of, his, eye, ancient, of, days, the, rose, of, sharon, second, there, are, paraphrases, of, individual, and, combined, verses, redburn, s, thou, shalt, not, lay, stripes, upon, these, roman, citizens, makes, use, of, language, of, the, ten, commandments, in, ex, 20, and, pierre, s, inquiry, of, lucy, loveth, she, me, with, the, love, past, all, understanding, combines, john, 21, 15, 17, and, philippians, 4, 7, third, certain, hebraisms, are, used, such, as, a, succession, of, genitives, all, the, waves, of, the, billows, of, the, seas, of, the, boisterous, mob, the, cognate, accusative, i, dreamed, a, dream, liverpool, was, created, with, the, creation, and, the, parallel, closer, home, does, it, go, than, a, rammer, and, fighting, with, steel, is, a, play, without, ever, an, interlude, this, passage, from, redburn, shows, how, these, ways, of, alluding, interlock, and, result, in, a, texture, of, biblical, language, though, there, is, very, little, direct, quotation, the, other, world, beyond, this, which, was, longed, for, by, the, devout, before, columbus, time, was, found, in, the, new, and, the, deep, sea, land, that, first, struck, these, soundings, brought, up, the, soil, of, earth, s, paradise, not, a, paradise, then, or, now, but, to, be, made, so, at, god, s, good, pleasure, and, in, the, fulness, and, mellowness, of, time, the, seed, is, sown, and, the, harvest, must, come, and, our, children, s, children, on, the, world, s, jubilee, morning, shall, all, go, with, their, sickles, to, the, reaping, then, shall, the, curse, of, babel, be, revoked, a, new, pentecost,

regions, round, about, italians, and, indians, and, moors, there, shall, appear, unto, them, cloven, tongues, as, of, fire, in, addition, to, this, melville, successfully, imitates, three, biblical, strains, the, apocalyptic, the, prophetic, and, the, sermonic, narrative, tone, of, writing, melville, sustains, the, apocalyptic, tone, of, anxiety, and, foreboding, for, a, whole, chapter, of, mardi, the, prophetic, strain, is, expressed, by, melville, in, moby, dick, most, notably, in, father, mapple, s, sermon, the, tradition, of, the, psalms, is, imitated, at, length, by, melville, in, the, confidence, man, in, 1849, melville, acquired, an, edition, of, shakespeare, s, works, printed, in, a, font, large, enough, for, his, tired, eyes, which, led, to, a, deeper, study, of, shakespeare, that, greatly, influenced, the, style, of, his, next, book, moby, dick, 1851, the, critic, f, o, matthiessen, found, that, the, language, of, shakespeare, far, surpasses, other, influences, upon, the, book, in, that, it, inspired, melville, to, discover, his, own, full, strength, on, almost, every, page, debts, to, shakespeare, can, be, discovered, the, mere, sounds, full, of, leviathanism, but, signifying, nothing, at, the, end, of, cetology, ch, 32, echo, the, famous, phrase, in, macbeth, told, by, an, idiot, full, of, sound, and, fury, signifying, nothing, ahab, s, first, extended, speech, to, the, crew, in, the, quarter, deck, ch, 36, is, practically, blank, verse, and, so, is, ahab, s, soliloquy, at, the, beginning, of, sunset, ch, 37, i, leave, a, white, and, turbid, wake, pale, waters, paler, cheeks, where, er, i, sail, the, envious, billows, sidelong, swell, to, whelm, my, track, let, them, but, first, i, pass, through, shakespeare, melville, infused, moby, dick, with, a, power, of, expression, he, had, not, previously, expressed, reading, shakespeare, had, been, a, catalytic, agent, for, melville, one, that, transformed, his, writing, from, merely, reporting, to, the, expression, of, profound, natural, forces, the, extent, to, which, melville, assimilated, shakespeare, is, evident, in, the, description, of, ahab, matthiessen, continues, which, ends, in, language, that, seems, shakespearean, yet, is, no, imitation, oh, ahab, what, shall, be, grand, in, thee, it, must, needs, be, plucked, from, the, skies, and, dived, for, in, the, deep, and, featured, in, the, unbodied, air, the, imaginative, richness, of, the, final, phrase, seems, particularly, shakespearean, but, its, two, key, words, appear, only, once, each, in, the, plays, and, to, neither, of, these, usages, is, melville, indebted, for, his, fresh, combination, melville, s, diction, depended, upon, no, source, and, his, prose, is, not, based, on, anybody, else, s, verse, but, on, an, awareness, of, speech, rhythm, melville, s, mastering, of, shakespeare, matthiessen, finds, supplied, him, with, verbal, resources, that, enabled, him, to, create, dramatic, language, through, three, essential, techniques, first, the, use, of, verbs, of, action, creates, a, sense, of, movement, and, meaning, the, effective, tension, caused, by, the, contrast, of, thou, launchest, navies, of, full, freighted, worlds, and, there, s, that, in, here, that, still, remains, indifferent, in, the, candles, ch, 119, makes, the, last, clause, lead, to, a, compulsion, to, strike, the, breast, which, suggests, how, thoroughly, the, drama, has, come, to, inhere, in, the, words, second, melville, took, advantage, of, the, shakespearean, energy, of, verbal, compounds, as, in, full, freighted, third, melville, employed, the, device, of, making, one, part, of, speech, act, as, another, for, example, earthquake, as, an, adjective, or, turning, an, adjective, into, a, noun, as, in, placeless, melville, s, style, in, nathalia, wright, s, analysis, seamlessly, flows, over, into, theme, because, all, these, borrowings, have, an, artistic, purpose, which, is, to, suggest, an, appearance, larger, and, more, significant, than, life, for, characters, and, themes, that, are, in, fact, unremarkable, the, allusions, suggest, that, beyond, the, world, of, appearances, another, world, exists, one, that, influences, this, world, and, where, ultimate, truth, can, be, found, moreover, the, ancient, background, thus, suggested, for, melville, s, narratives, ancient, allusions, being, next, in, number, to, the, biblical, ones, invests, them, with, a, sense, of, timelessness, melville, s, financial, success, as, a, writer, during, his, lifetime, was, not, great, relative, to, his, posthumous, success, over, his, entire, lifetime, melville, s, writings, earned, him, just, over, 10, 000, equivalent, to, 286, 125, in, 2023, melville, s, travelogues, based, on, voyages, to, the, south, seas, and, stories, based, on, his, time, in, the, merchant, marine, and, navy, led, to, some, initial, success, but, his, popularity, declined, dramatically, afterwards, by, 1876, all, of, his, books, were, out, of, print, he, was, viewed, as, a, minor, figure, in, american, literature, in, the, later, years, of, his, life, and, during, the, years, immediately, after, his, death, melville, did, not, publish, poetry, until, his, late, thirties, with, battle, pieces, 1866, and, did, not, receive, recognition, as, a, poet, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, but, he, wrote, predominantly, poetry, for, about, 25, years, twice, as, long, as, his, prose, career, the, three, novels, of, the, 1850s, that, melville, worked, on, most, seriously, to, present, his, philosophical, explorations, moby, dick, pierre, and, the, confidence, man, seem, to, make, the, step, to, philosophical, poetry, a, natural, one, rather, than, simply, a, consequence, of, commercial, failure, since, he, turned, to, poetry, as, a, meditative, practice, his, poetic, style, even, more, than, most, victorian, poets, was, not, marked, by, linguistic, play, or, melodic, considerations, early, critics, were, not, sympathetic, henry, chapin, in, his, introduction, to, john, marr, and, other, poems, 1922, one, of, the, earlier, selections, of, melville, s, poetry, said, melville, s, verse, is, of, an, amateurish, and, uneven, quality, but, in, it, that, loveable, freshness, of, personality, which, his, philosophical, dejection, never, quenched, is, everywhere, in, evidence, in, the, voice, of, a, true, poet, the, poet, and, novelist, robert, penn, warren, became, a, champion, of, melville, as, a, great, american, poet, and, issued, a, selection, of, melville, s, poetry, in, 1971, prefaced, by, an, admiring, critical, essay, in, the, 1990s, critic, lawrence, buell, argued, that, melville, is, justly, said, to, be, nineteenth, century, america, s, leading, poet, after, whitman, and, dickinson, and, helen, vendler, remarked, of, clarel, what, it, cost, melville, to, write, this, poem, makes, us, pause, reading, it, alone, it, is, enough, to, win, him, as, a, poet, what, he, called, the, belated, funeral, flower, of, fame, some, critics, now, place, him, as, the, first, modernist, poet, in, the, united, states, while, others, assert, that, his, work, more, strongly, suggests, what, today, would, be, a, postmodern, view, the, centennial, of, melville, s, birth, in, 1919, coincided, with, a, renewed, interest, in, his, writings, known, as, the, melville, revival, during, which, his, work, experienced, a, significant, critical, reassessment, the, renewed, appreciation, began, in, 1917, with, carl, van, doren, s, article, on, melville, in, a, standard, history, of, american, literature, van, doren, also, encouraged, raymond, weaver, who, wrote, the, author, s, first, full, length, biography, herman, melville, mariner, and, mystic, 1921, discovering, the, unfinished, manuscript, of, billy, budd, among, papers, shown, to, him, by, melville, s, granddaughter, weaver, edited, it, and, published, it, in, a, new, collected, edition, of, melville, s, works, other, works, that, helped, fan, the, flames, for, melville, were, carl, van, doren, s, the, american, novel, 1921, d, h, lawrence, s, studies, in, classic, american, literature, 1923, carl, van, vechten, s, essay, in, the, double, dealer, 1922, and, lewis, mumford, s, biography, herman, melville, 1929, starting, in, the, mid, 1930s, the, yale, university, scholar, stanley, thomas, williams, supervised, more, than, a, dozen, dissertations, on, melville, that, were, eventually, published, as, books, where, the, first, wave, of, melville, scholars, focused, on, psychology, williams, students, were, prominent, in, establishing, melville, studies, as, an, academic, field, concerned, with, texts, and, manuscripts, tracing, melville, s, influences, and, borrowings, even, plagiarism, and, exploring, archives, and, local, publications, to, provide, historical, evidence, the, independent, scholar, jay, leyda, searched, libraries, family, papers, local, archives, and, newspapers, across, new, england, and, new, york, to, document, melville, s, life, day, by, day, for, his, two, volume, the, melville, log, 1951, sparked, by, leyda, and, post, war, scholars, the, second, phase, of, the, melville, revival, emphasized, research, into, the, biography, of, melville, rather, than, accepting, melville, s, early, books, as, reliable, accounts, in, 1945, the, melville, society, was, founded, a, non, profit, organisation, dedicated, to, the, study, of, melville, s, life, and, works, between, 1969, and, 2003, the, society, published, 125, issues, of, melville, society, extracts, which, are, now, freely, available, on, the, society, s, website, since, 1999, it, has, published, leviathan, a, journal, of, melville, studies, currently, three, issues, a, year, published, by, johns, hopkins, university, press, the, postwar, scholars, tended, to, think, that, weaver, harvard, psychologist, henry, murray, and, mumford, favored, freudian, interpretations, that, read, melville, s, fiction, as, autobiography, exaggerated, his, suffering, in, the, family, and, inferred, a, homosexual, attachment, to, hawthorne, they, saw, a, different, arc, to, melville, s, writing, career, the, first, biographers, saw, a, tragic, withdrawal, after, the, cold, critical, reception, for, his, prose, works, and, largely, dismissed, his, poetry, a, new, view, emerged, of, melville, s, turn, to, poetry, as, a, conscious, choice, that, placed, him, among, the, most, important, american, poets, other, post, war, studies, however, continued, the, broad, imaginative, and, interpretive, style, charles, olson, s, call, me, ishmael, 1947, presented, ahab, as, a, shakespearean, tragic, hero, and, newton, arvin, s, critical, biography, herman, melville,

with, backing, from, the, modern, language, association, and, funding, from, the, national, endowment, for, the, humanities, to, edit, and, publish, reliable, critical, texts, of, melville, s,

in, 1968, and, the, last, in, the, fall, of, 2017, the, aim, of, the, editors, was, to, present, a, text, as, close, as, possible, to, the, author, s, intention, as, surviving, evidence, permits, the, volumes, have, extensive, appendices, including, textual, variants, from, each, of, the, editions, published, in, melville, s, lifetime, an, historical, note, on, the, publishing, history, and, critical, reception, and, related, documents, because, the, texts, were, prepared, with, financial, support, from, the, united, states, department, of, education, no, royalties, are, charged, and, they, have, been, widely, reprinted, hershel, parker, published, his, two, volume, herman, melville, a, biography, in, 1996, and, 2002, based, on, extensive, original, research, and, his, involvement, as, editor, of, the, northwestern, newberry, melville, edition, melville, only, gradually, attracted, the, pioneering, scholars, of, women, s, studies, gender, and, sexuality, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, though, some, held, that, he, hardly, portrayed, women, at, all, others, saw, the, few, women, in, his, works, as, traditional, figures, representing, or, even, attacking, nineteenth, century, gentility, sentimentality, and, conventional, morality, melville, s, preference, for, sea, going, tales, that, involved, almost, only, males, has, been, of, interest, to, scholars, in, men, s, studies, and, especially, gay, and, queer, studies, melville, was, remarkably, open, in, his, exploration, of, sexuality, of, all, sorts, alvin, sandberg, said, that, the, short, story, the, paradise, of, bachelors, and, the, tartarus, of, maids, offers, an, exploration, of, impotency, a, portrayal, of, a, man, retreating, to, an, all, male, childhood, to, avoid, confrontation, with, sexual, manhood, from, which, the, narrator, engages, in, congenial, digressions, in, heterogeneity, in, line, with, this, view, warren, rosenberg, argues, the, homosocial, paradise, of, bachelors, is, blind, to, what, is, real, and, painful, in, the, world, and, thus, are, superficial, and, sterile, david, harley, serlin, observes, in, the, second, half, of, melville, s, diptych, the, tartarus, of, maids, the, narrator, gives, voice, to, the, oppressed, women, he, observes, as, other, scholars, have, noted, the, slave, image, here, has, two, clear, connotations, one, describes, the, exploitation, of, the, women, s, physical, labor, and, the, other, describes, the, exploitation, of, the, women, s, reproductive, organs, of, course, as, models, of, women, s, oppression, the, two, are, clearly, intertwined, in, the, end, serlin, says, that, the, narrator, is, never, fully, able, to, come, to, terms, with, the, contrasting, masculine, and, feminine, modalities, issues, of, sexuality, have, been, observed, in, other, works, as, well, rosenberg, notes, taji, in, mardi, and, the, protagonist, in, pierre, think, they, are, saving, young, maidens, in, distress, yillah, and, isabel, out, of, the, purest, of, reasons, but, both, are, also, conscious, of, a, lurking, sexual, motive, when, taji, kills, the, old, priest, holding, yillah, captive, he, says, emorse, smote, me, hard, and, like, lightning, i, asked, myself, whether, the, death, deed, i, had, done, was, sprung, of, virtuous, motive, the, rescuing, of, a, captive, from, thrall, or, whether, beneath, the, pretense, i, had, engaged, in, this, fatal, affray, for, some, other, selfish, purpose, the, companionship, of, a, beautiful, maid, in, pierre, the, motive, of, the, protagonist, s, sacrifice, for, isabel, is, admitted, womanly, beauty, and, not, womanly, ugliness, invited, him, to, champion, the, right, rosenberg, argues, this, awareness, of, a, double, motive, haunts, both, books, and, ultimately, destroys, their, protagonists, who, would, not, fully, acknowledge, the, dark, underside, of, their, idealism, the, epistemological, quest, and, the, transcendental, quest, for, love, and, belief, are, consequently, sullied, by, the, erotic, rosenberg, says, that, melville, fully, explores, the, theme, of, sexuality, in, his, major, epic, poem, clarel, when, the, narrator, is, separated, from, ruth, with, whom, he, has, fallen, in, love, he, is, free, to, explore, other, sexual, and, religious, possibilities, before, deciding, at, the, end, of, the, poem, to, participate, in, the, ritualistic, order, represented, by, marriage, in, the, course, of, the, poem, he, considers, every, form, of, sexual, orientation, celibacy, homosexuality, hedonism, and, heterosexuality, raising, the, same, kinds, of, questions, as, when, he, considers, islam, or, democracy, some, passages, and, sections, of, melville, s, works, demonstrate, his, willingness, to, address, all, forms, of, sexuality, including, the, homoerotic, in, his, works, commonly, noted, examples, from, moby, dick, are, the, marriage, bed, episode, involving, ishmael, and, queequeg, who, sleep, with, their, arms, wrapped, around, each, other, chapter, 4, the, counterpane, and, chapter, 10, a, bosom, friend, and, the, squeeze, of, the, hand, chapter, 94, describing, the, camaraderie, of, sailors, extracting, spermaceti, from, a, dead, whale, clarel, recognizes, the, homoerotic, potential, of, its, eponymous, protagonist, including, in, a, fairly, explicit, passage, an, erection, provoked, by, the, figure, of, a, male, interlocutor, lyonesse, in, addition, rosenberg, notes, that, billy, budd, s, physical, attractiveness, is, described, in, quasi, feminine, terms, as, the, handsome, sailor, billy, budd, s, position, aboard, the, seventy, four, was, something, analogous, to, that, of, a, rustic, beauty, transplanted, from, the, provinces, and, brought, into, competition, with, the, highborn, dames, of, the, court, melville, has, been, useful, in, the, field, of, law, and, literature, the, chapter, fast, fish, and, loose, fish, in, moby, dick, for, instance, challenges, concepts, of, property, rights, in, billy, budd, a, handsome, and, popular, young, sailor, strikes, and, inadvertently, kills, the, ship, s, master, at, arms, the, ship, s, captain, immediately, convenes, a, court, martial, at, which, he, urges, the, court, to, convict, and, sentence, billy, to, death, critics, debate, melville, s, intention, some, see, the, contradiction, between, unbending, legalism, and, malleable, moral, principles, other, critics, have, argued, that, the, captain, manipulated, and, misrepresented, the, applicable, laws, melville, s, work, often, touched, on, themes, of, communicative, expression, and, the, pursuit, of, the, absolute, among, illusions, as, early, as, 1839, in, the, juvenile, sketch, fragments, from, a, writing, desk, melville, explores, a, problem, that, would, reappear, in, the, short, stories, bartleby, 1853, and, benito, cereno, 1855, the, impossibility, to, find, common, ground, for, mutual, communication, the, sketch, centers, on, the, protagonist, and, a, mute, lady, leading, scholar, sealts, to, observe, melville, s, deep, concern, with, expression, and, communication, evidently, began, early, in, his, career, according, to, scholar, nathalia, wright, melville, s, characters, are, all, preoccupied, by, the, same, intense, superhuman, and, eternal, quest, for, the, absolute, amidst, its, relative, manifestations, an, enterprise, central, to, the, melville, canon, all, melville, s, plots, describe, this, pursuit, and, all, his, themes, represent, the, delicate, and, shifting, relationship, between, its, truth, and, its, illusion, it, is, not, clear, however, what, the, moral, and, metaphysical, implications, of, this, quest, are, because, melville, did, not, distinguish, between, these, two, aspects, throughout, his, life, melville, struggled, with, and, gave, shape, to, the, same, set, of, epistemological, doubts, and, the, metaphysical, issues, these, doubts, engendered, an, obsession, for, the, limits, of, knowledge, led, to, the, question, of, god, s, existence, and, nature, the, indifference, of, the, universe, and, the, problem, of, evil, in, 1854, three, years, following, publication, of, moby, dick, melville, new,
