at, olympia, was, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, phidias, also, designed, the, statues, of, the, goddess, athena, on, the, athenian, acropolis, namely, the, athena, parthenos, inside, the, parthenon, and, the, athena, promachos, a, colossal, bronze, which, stood, between, it, and, the, propylaea, a, monumental, gateway, that, served, as, the, entrance, to, the, acropolis, in, athens, phidias, was, the, son, of, charmides, of, athens, the, ancients, believed, that, his, masters, were, hegias, and, ageladas, plutarch, discusses, phidias, friendship, with, the, greek, statesman, pericles, recording, that, enemies, of, pericles, tried, to, attack, him, through, phidias, who, was, accused, of, stealing, gold, intended, for, the, parthenon, s, statue, of, athena, and, of, impiously, portraying, himself, and, pericles, on, the, shield, of, the, statue, the, historical, value, of, this, account, as, well, as, the, legend, about, accusations, against, the, periclean, circle, is, debatable, but, aristophanes, mentions, an, incident, with, phidias, around, that, time, phidias, is, often, credited, as, the, main, instigator, of, the, classical, greek, sculptural, design, today, most, critics, and, historians, consider, him, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, ancient, greek, sculptors, of, phidias, life, little, is, known, apart, from, his, works, although, no, original, works, exist, that, can, be, attributed, to, him, with, certainty, numerous, roman, copies, of, varying, degrees, of, fidelity, are, known, to, exist, the, earliest, of, phidias, works, were, dedications, in, memory, of, marathon, celebrating, the, greek, victory, his, first, commission, was, a, group, of, national, heroes, with, miltiades, as, a, central, figure, at, delphi, he, created, a, great, group, in, bronze, including, the, figures, of, greek, gods, apollo, and, athena, several, attic, heroes, and, general, miltiades, the, younger, on, the, acropolis, of, athens, phidias, constructed, a, colossal, bronze, statue, of, athena, the, athena, promachos, which, was, visible, far, out, at, sea, athena, was, the, goddess, of, wisdom, and, warriors, and, the, protector, of, athens, at, pellene, in, achaea, and, at, plataea, phidias, made, two, other, statues, of, athena, as, well, as, a, statue, of, the, goddess, aphrodite, in, ivory, and, gold, for, the, people, of, elis, in, antiquity, phidias, was, celebrated, for, his, statues, in, bronze, and, his, chryselephantine, works, statues, made, of, gold, and, ivory, in, the, hippias, major, plato, claims, that, phidias, seldom, if, ever, executed, works, in, marble, unlike, many, sculptors, of, his, time, plutarch, writes, that, he, superintended, the, great, works, ordered, by, greek, statesman, pericles, on, the, acropolis, ancient, critics, take, a, very, high, view, of, the, merits, of, phidias, they, especially, praise, the, ethos, or, permanent, moral, level, of, his, works, as, compared, with, those, of, the, later, so, called, pathetic, school, both, pausanias, and, plutarch, mention, works, of, his, depicting, the, warlike, athena, areia, demetrius, calls, his, statues, sublime, and, at, the, same, time, precise, in, 447, bc, pericles, commissioned, several, sculptures, for, athens, from, phidias, to, celebrate, the, greek, victory, against, the, persians, at, the, battle, of, marathon, during, the, greco, persian, wars, 490, bc, pericles, used, some, of, the, money, from, the, maritime, league, of, delos, to, rebuild, and, decorate, athens, to, celebrate, this, victory, inscriptions, prove, that, the, marble, blocks, intended, for, the, pedimental, statues, of, the, parthenon, were, not, brought, to, athens, until, 434, bc, it, is, therefore, possible, that, most, of, sculptural, decoration, of, the, parthenon, was, the, work, of, phidias, workshop, including, pupils, of, phidias, such, as, alcamenes, and, agoracritus, according, to, pausanias, 1, 28, 2, the, original, bronze, athena, lemnia, was, created, by, phidias, c, 450, 440, bc, for, athenians, living, on, lemnos, he, described, it, as, the, best, of, all, pheidias, s, works, to, see, adolf, furtw, ngler, suggested, that, he, found, a, copy, of, the, athena, lemnia, in, a, statue, of, which, the, head, is, located, in, bologna, and, the, body, is, at, dresden, some, 5th, century, bc, torsos, of, athena, have, been, found, at, athens, the, torso, of, athena, in, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, at, paris, which, has, lost, its, head, gives, some, idea, of, what, the, original, statue, may, have, looked, like, for, the, ancient, greeks, two, works, of, phidias, far, outshone, all, others, the, colossal, chryselephantine, statue, of, zeus, c, 432, bc, which, was, erected, in, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympia, and, the, athena, parthenos, lit, athena, the, virgin, a, sculpture, of, the, virgin, goddess, athena, which, was, housed, in, the, parthenon, in, athens, both, sculptures, belong, to, about, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, bc, a, number, of, replicas, and, works, inspired, by, it, both, ancient, and, modern, have, been, made, upon, completing, the, athena, parthenos, phidias, was, accused, of, embezzlement, specifically, he, was, charged, with, shortchanging, the, amount, of, gold, that, was, supposed, to, be, used, for, the, statue, and, keeping, the, extra, for, himself, it, seems, that, the, charge, was, politically, motivated, a, result, of, his, friendship, with, pericles, who, had, many, enemies, in, athens, phidias, supposedly, weighed, the, gold, robe, of, the, athena, parthenos, to, prove, his, innocence, but, was, then, accused, of, impiously, portraying, himself, and, pericles, on, the, shield, of, the, statue, which, was, apparently, true, plutarch, records, that, phidias, was, imprisoned, and, died, in, jail, aristophanes, play, peace, c, 421, bc, mentions, an, unfortunate, incident, involving, phidias, but, little, context, is, provided, according, to, philochorus, as, quoted, by, a, scholiast, on, aristophanes, phidias, was, put, to, death, by, the, eleans, after, he, completed, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, for, them, from, the, late, 5th, century, bc, small, copies, of, the, statue, of, zeus, were, found, on, coins, from, elis, which, give, a, general, notion, of, the, pose, and, the, character, of, the, head, the, god, was, seated, on, a, throne, every, part, of, which, was, used, for, sculptural, decoration, his, body, was, of, ivory, his, robe, of, gold, his, head, was, of, a, somewhat, archaic, type, the, bust, of, zeus, found, at, otricoli, which, used, to, be, regarded, as, a, copy, of, the, head, of, the, olympian, statue, is, certainly, more, than, a, century, later, in, style, a, significant, advancement, in, the, knowledge, of, phidias, working, methodology, came, during, 1954, 58, with, the, excavation, of, the, workshop, at, olympia, where, he, created, the, statue, of, zeus, tools, terracotta, molds, and, a, cup, inscribed, on, the, bottom, pheid, ou, eim, i, belong, to, phidias, literally, of, phidias, i, am, were, found, here, just, where, pausanias, said, the, statue, was, constructed, the, discovery, has, enabled, archaeologists, to, re, create, the, techniques, used, to, make, the, statue, and, confirm, its, date, by, 1910, mathematician, mark, barr, began, using, the, greek, letter, phi, as, a, symbol, for, the, golden, ratio, after, phidias, however, barr, later, wrote, that, he, thought, it, unlikely, that, phidias, actually, used, the, golden, ratio, footnotes, citations
