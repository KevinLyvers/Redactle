joseph, anton, bruckner, german, 4, september, 1824, 11, october, 1896, was, an, austrian, composer, and, organist, best, known, for, his, symphonies, and, sacred, music, which, includes, masses, te, deum, and, motets, the, symphonies, are, considered, emblematic, of, the, final, stage, of, austro, german, romanticism, because, of, their, rich, harmonic, language, strongly, polyphonic, character, and, considerable, length, bruckner, s, compositions, helped, to, define, contemporary, musical, radicalism, owing, to, their, dissonances, unprepared, modulations, and, roving, harmonies, unlike, other, musical, radicals, such, as, richard, wagner, and, hugo, wolf, bruckner, showed, respect, even, humility, before, other, famous, musicians, wagner, in, particular, this, apparent, dichotomy, between, bruckner, the, man, and, bruckner, the, composer, hampers, efforts, to, describe, his, life, in, a, way, that, gives, a, straightforward, context, for, his, music, hans, von, b, low, described, him, as, half, genius, half, simpleton, bruckner, was, critical, of, his, own, work, and, often, reworked, his, compositions, there, are, several, versions, of, many, of, his, works, his, works, the, symphonies, in, particular, had, detractors, most, notably, the, influential, austrian, critic, eduard, hanslick, and, other, supporters, of, johannes, brahms, who, pointed, to, their, large, size, and, use, of, repetition, as, well, as, to, bruckner, s, propensity, for, revising, many, of, his, works, often, with, the, assistance, of, colleagues, and, his, apparent, indecision, about, which, versions, he, preferred, on, the, other, hand, bruckner, was, greatly, admired, by, subsequent, composers, including, his, friend, gustav, mahler, anton, bruckner, was, born, in, ansfelden, then, a, village, now, almost, a, suburb, of, linz, on, 4, september, 1824, the, ancestors, of, bruckner, s, family, were, farmers, and, craftsmen, their, history, can, be, traced, as, far, back, as, the, 16th, century, they, lived, near, a, bridge, south, of, sindelburg, which, led, to, their, being, called, bruckhner, an, der, bruckhen, bridgers, on, the, bridge, bruckner, s, grandfather, was, appointed, schoolmaster, in, ansfelden, in, 1776, this, position, was, inherited, by, bruckner, s, father, anton, bruckner, sr, in, 1823, it, was, a, poorly, paid, but, well, respected, position, in, the, rural, environment, bruckner, sr, married, therese, helm, and, they, had, eleven, children, anton, bruckner, being, the, eldest, music, was, a, part, of, the, school, curriculum, and, bruckner, s, father, was, his, first, music, teacher, bruckner, learned, to, play, the, organ, early, as, a, child, he, was, very, dedicated, to, the, instrument, just, as, he, was, later, in, life, in, composing, often, practising, for, 12, hours, a, day, he, entered, school, when, he, was, six, proved, to, be, a, hard, working, student, and, was, promoted, to, upper, class, early, while, studying, bruckner, also, helped, his, father, in, teaching, the, other, children, after, bruckner, received, his, confirmation, in, 1833, bruckner, s, father, sent, him, to, another, school, in, h, rsching, the, schoolmaster, johann, baptist, wei, was, a, music, enthusiast, and, respected, organist, here, bruckner, completed, his, school, education, and, refined, his, skills, as, an, organist, around, 1835, bruckner, wrote, his, first, composition, a, pange, lingua, one, of, the, compositions, which, he, revised, at, the, end, of, his, life, when, his, father, became, ill, anton, returned, to, ansfelden, to, help, him, in, his, work, bruckner, s, father, died, in, 1837, when, bruckner, was, 13, years, old, the, teacher, s, position, and, house, were, given, to, a, successor, and, bruckner, was, sent, to, the, augustinian, monastery, in, sankt, florian, to, become, a, choirboy, in, addition, to, choir, practice, his, education, included, violin, and, organ, lessons, bruckner, was, in, awe, of, the, monastery, s, great, organ, which, was, built, during, the, late, baroque, era, and, rebuilt, in, 1837, and, he, sometimes, played, it, during, church, services, despite, his, musical, abilities, bruckner, s, mother, sent, her, son, to, a, teaching, seminar, in, linz, in, 1841, after, completing, the, seminar, with, an, excellent, grade, bruckner, was, sent, as, an, assistant, teacher, to, a, school, in, windhaag, the, living, standards, and, pay, were, appalling, and, bruckner, was, constantly, humiliated, by, his, superior, teacher, franz, fuchs, despite, the, difficult, situation, bruckner, never, complained, or, rebelled, a, belief, in, his, own, inferiority, was, to, remain, one, of, bruckner, s, main, personal, traits, during, his, whole, life, he, stayed, at, windhaag, from, age, 17, to, 19, teaching, general, subjects, prelate, michael, arneth, noticed, bruckner, s, bad, situation, in, windhaag, and, awarded, him, an, assistant, teacher, position, in, the, vicinity, of, the, monastic, town, of, sankt, florian, sending, him, to, kronstorf, an, der, enns, for, two, years, here, he, would, be, able, to, have, more, of, a, part, in, musical, activity, the, time, in, kronstorf, was, a, much, happier, one, for, bruckner, between, 1843, and, 1845, bruckner, was, the, pupil, of, leopold, von, zenetti, in, enns, compared, to, the, few, works, he, wrote, in, windhaag, the, kronstorf, compositions, from, 1843, to, 1845, show, a, significantly, improved, artistic, ability, and, finally, the, beginnings, of, what, could, be, called, the, bruckner, style, among, the, kronstorf, works, is, the, vocal, piece, asperges, me, wab, 4, which, the, young, assistant, teacher, out, of, line, given, his, position, signed, with, anton, bruckner, m, p, ria, comp, this, has, been, interpreted, as, a, lone, early, sign, of, bruckner, s, artistic, ambitions, otherwise, little, is, known, of, bruckner, s, life, plans, and, intentions, after, the, kronstorf, period, bruckner, returned, to, sankt, florian, in, 1845, where, for, the, next, 10, years, he, would, work, as, a, teacher, and, an, organist, in, may, 1845, bruckner, passed, an, examination, which, allowed, him, to, begin, work, as, an, assistant, teacher, in, one, of, the, village, schools, of, sankt, florian, he, continued, to, improve, his, education, by, taking, further, courses, passing, an, examination, giving, him, permission, to, also, teach, in, higher, education, institutes, receiving, the, grade, very, good, in, all, disciplines, in, 1848, bruckner, was, appointed, an, organist, in, sankt, florian, and, in, 1851, this, was, made, a, regular, position, in, sankt, florian, most, of, the, repertoire, consisted, of, the, music, of, michael, haydn, johann, georg, albrechtsberger, and, franz, joseph, aumann, during, his, stay, in, sankt, florian, bruckner, continued, to, work, with, zenetti, in, 1855, bruckner, aspiring, to, become, a, student, of, the, famous, vienna, music, theorist, simon, sechter, showed, the, master, his, missa, solemnis, wab, 29, written, a, year, earlier, and, was, accepted, the, education, which, included, skills, in, music, theory, and, counterpoint, among, others, took, place, mostly, via, correspondence, but, also, included, long, in, person, sessions, in, vienna, sechter, s, teaching, would, have, a, profound, influence, on, bruckner, later, when, bruckner, began, teaching, music, himself, he, would, base, his, curriculum, on, sechter, s, book, die, grunds, tze, der, musikalischen, komposition, leipzig, 1853, 54, largely, self, taught, as, a, composer, bruckner, only, started, composing, seriously, at, age, 37, in, 1861, bruckner, studied, further, with, otto, kitzler, who, was, nine, years, younger, than, him, and, who, introduced, him, to, the, music, of, richard, wagner, which, bruckner, studied, extensively, from, 1863, onwards, bruckner, considered, the, earliest, orchestral, works, the, study, symphony, in, f, minor, the, three, orchestral, pieces, the, march, in, d, minor, and, the, overture, in, g, minor, which, he, composed, in, 1862, 1863, mere, school, exercises, done, under, the, supervision, of, otto, kitzler, he, continued, his, studies, to, the, age, of, 40, broad, fame, and, acceptance, did, not, come, until, he, was, over, 60, after, the, premiere, of, his, seventh, symphony, in, 1884, in, 1861, he, had, already, made, the, acquaintance, of, franz, liszt, who, like, bruckner, had, a, strong, catholic, religious, faith, and, who, first, and, foremost, was, a, harmonic, innovator, initiating, the, new, german, school, together, with, wagner, in, may, 1861, he, made, his, concert, debut, as, both, composer, and, conductor, of, his, ave, maria, set, in, seven, parts, soon, after, bruckner, had, ended, his, studies, under, sechter, and, kitzler, he, wrote, his, the, mass, in, d, minor, from, 1861, to, 1868, he, alternated, his, time, between, vienna, and, sankt, florian, he, wished, to, ensure, he, knew, how, to, make, his, music, modern, but, he, also, wanted, to, spend, time, in, a, more, religious, setting, in, 1868, after, sechter, had, died, bruckner, hesitantly, accepted, sechter, s, post, as, a, teacher, of, music, theory, at, the, vienna, conservatory, during, which, time, he, concentrated, most, of, his, energy, on, writing, symphonies, these, symphonies, were, poorly, received, at, times, considered, wild, and, nonsensical, his, students, at, the, conservatory, included, richard, robert, his, student, friedrich, klose, wrote, a, book, about, his, impressions, of, bruckner, as, a, composer, and, a, teacher, he, later, accepted, a, post, at, the, vienna, university, in, 1875, where, he, tried, to, make, music, theory, a, part, of, the, curriculum, overall, he, was, unhappy, in, vienna, which, was, musically, dominated, by, the, critic, eduard, hanslick, at, the, time, there, was, a, feud, between, advocates, of, the, music, of, wagner, and, brahms, by, aligning, himself, with, wagner, bruckner, made, an, unintentional, enemy, out, of, hanslick, he, was, not, without, supporters, though, deutsche, zeitung, s, music, critic, theodor, helm, and, famous, conductors, such, as, arthur, nikisch, and, franz, schalk, constantly, tried, to, bring, his, music, to, the, public, and, for, this, purpose, proposed, improvements, for, making, bruckner, s, music, more, acceptable, to, the, public, bruckner, bequeathed, his, original, scores, to, the, austrian, national, library, in, vienna, in, addition, to, his, symphonies, bruckner, wrote, masses, motets, and, other, sacred, choral, works, and, a, few, chamber, works, including, a, string, quintet, unlike, his, romantic, symphonies, some, of, bruckner, s, choral, works, are, often, conservative, and, contrapuntal, in, style, however, the, te, deum, helgoland, psalm, 150, and, at, least, one, mass, demonstrate, innovative, and, radical, uses, of, chromaticism, biographers, generally, characterize, bruckner, as, a, simple, provincial, man, and, many, biographers, have, complained, that, there, is, huge, discrepancy, between, bruckner, s, life, and, his, work, for, example, karl, grebe, said, his, life, doesn, t, tell, anything, about, his, work, and, his, work, doesn, t, tell, anything, about, his, life, that, s, the, uncomfortable, fact, any, biography, must, start, from, anecdotes, abound, as, to, bruckner, s, dogged, pursuit, of, his, chosen, craft, and, his, humble, acceptance, of, the, fame, that, eventually, came, his, way, once, after, a, rehearsal, of, his, fourth, symphony, in, 1881, the, well, meaning, bruckner, tipped, the, conductor, hans, richter, when, the, symphony, was, over, richter, related, bruckner, came, to, me, his, face, beaming, with, enthusiasm, and, joy, i, felt, him, press, a, coin, into, my, hand, take, this, he, said, and, drink, a, glass, of, beer, to, my, health, richter, of, course, accepted, the, coin, a, maria, theresa, thaler, and, wore, it, on, his, watch, chain, ever, after, bruckner, was, a, renowned, organist, in, his, day, impressing, audiences, in, france, in, 1869, and, the, united, kingdom, in, 1871, giving, six, recitals, on, a, new, henry, willis, organ, at, royal, albert, hall, in, london, and, five, more, at, the, crystal, palace, though, he, wrote, no, major, works, for, the, organ, his, improvisation, sessions, sometimes, yielded, ideas, for, the, symphonies, he, taught, organ, performance, at, the, conservatory, among, his, students, were, hans, rott, and, franz, schmidt, gustav, mahler, who, called, bruckner, his, forerunner, attended, the, conservatory, at, this, time, bruckner, was, a, lifelong, bachelor, who, made, numerous, unsuccessful, marriage, proposals, to, teenage, girls, one, such, was, the, daughter, of, a, friend, called, louise, in, his, grief, he, is, believed, to, have, written, the, cantata, entsagen, renunciation, his, affection, for, teenage, girls, led, to, an, accusation, of, impropriety, where, he, taught, music, and, while, he, was, exonerated, he, decided, to, concentrate, on, teaching, boys, afterwards, his, calendar, for, 1874, details, the, names, of, girls, who, appealed, to, him, and, the, list, of, such, girls, in, all, his, diaries, was, very, long, in, 1880, he, fell, for, a, 17, year, old, peasant, girl, in, the, cast, of, the, oberammergau, passion, play, his, interest, in, teenage, girls, seems, to, have, been, motivated, by, his, fear, of, sin, he, believed, that, unlike, older, women, he, could, be, certain, that, he, was, marrying, a, virgin, his, unsuccessful, proposals, to, teenagers, continued, when, he, was, past, his, 70th, birthday, one, prospect, berlin, hotel, chambermaid, ida, buhz, came, near, to, marrying, him, but, broke, off, the, engagement, when, she, refused, to, convert, to, catholicism, he, suffered, from, periodic, attacks, of, depression, with, his, numerous, failed, attempts, to, find, a, female, companion, only, adding, to, his, unhappiness, in, july, 1886, the, emperor, decorated, him, with, the, order, of, franz, joseph, he, most, likely, retired, from, his, position, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, 1892, at, the, age, of, 68, he, wrote, a, great, deal, of, music, that, he, used, to, help, teach, his, students, bruckner, died, in, vienna, in, 1896, at, the, age, of, 72, he, is, buried, in, the, crypt, of, the, monastery, church, at, sankt, florian, immediately, below, his, favorite, organ, he, had, always, had, a, fascination, with, death, and, dead, bodies, and, left, explicit, instructions, regarding, the, embalming, of, his, corpse, the, anton, bruckner, private, university, for, music, drama, and, dance, an, institution, of, higher, education, in, linz, close, to, his, native, ansfelden, was, named, after, him, in, 1932, as, the, bruckner, conservatory, linz, until, 2004, the, bruckner, orchestra, linz, was, also, named, in, his, honor, sometimes, bruckner, s, works, are, referred, to, by, wab, numbers, from, the, werkverzeichnis, anton, bruckner, a, catalogue, of, bruckner, s, works, edited, by, renate, grasberger, the, revision, issue, has, generated, controversy, a, common, explanation, for, the, multiple, versions, is, that, bruckner, was, willing, to, revise, his, work, on, the, basis, of, harsh, uninformed, criticism, from, his, colleagues, the, result, of, such, advice, was, to, awaken, immediately, all, the, insecurity, in, the, non, musical, part, of, bruckner, s, personality, musicologist, deryck, cooke, writes, lacking, all, self, assurance, in, such, matters, he, felt, obliged, to, bow, to, the, opinions, of, his, friends, the, experts, to, permit, revisions, and, even, to, help, make, them, in, some, cases, this, explanation, was, widely, accepted, when, it, was, championed, by, bruckner, scholar, robert, haas, who, was, the, chief, editor, of, the, first, critical, editions, of, bruckner, s, works, published, by, the, international, bruckner, society, it, continues, to, be, found, in, the, majority, of, program, notes, and, biographical, sketches, concerning, bruckner, haas, s, work, was, endorsed, by, the, nazis, and, so, fell, out, of, favour, after, the, war, as, the, allies, enforced, denazification, haas, s, rival, leopold, nowak, was, appointed, to, produce, a, whole, new, critical, edition, of, bruckner, s, works, he, and, others, such, as, benjamin, korstvedt, and, conductor, leon, botstein, argued, that, haas, s, explanation, is, at, best, idle, speculation, at, worst, a, shady, justification, of, haas, s, own, editorial, decisions, also, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, bruckner, often, started, work, on, a, symphony, just, days, after, finishing, the, one, before, as, deryck, cooke, writes, in, spite, of, continued, opposition, and, criticism, and, many, well, meaning, exhortations, to, caution, from, his, friends, he, looked, neither, to, right, nor, left, but, simply, got, down, to, work, on, the, next, symphony, the, matter, of, bruckner, s, authentic, texts, and, the, reasons, for, his, changes, to, them, remains, politicised, and, uncomfortable, bruckner, expanded, the, concept, of, the, symphonic, form, in, ways, that, have, never, been, witnessed, before, or, since, when, listening, to, a, bruckner, symphony, one, encounters, some, of, the, most, complex, symphonic, writing, ever, created, as, scholars, study, bruckner, s, scores, they, continue, to, revel, in, the, complexity, of, bruckner, s, creative, logic, bruckner, composed, eleven, symphonies, the, first, the, study, symphony, in, f, minor, in, 1863, the, last, the, unfinished, symphony, no, 9, in, d, minor, in, 1887, 96, with, the, exception, of, symphony, no, 4, romantic, none, of, bruckner, s, symphonies, originally, had, a, subtitle, and, in, the, case, of, those, that, now, do, the, nicknames, or, subtitles, did, not, originate, with, the, composer, bruckner, s, symphonies, are, scored, for, a, fairly, standard, orchestra, of, woodwinds, in, pairs, four, horns, two, or, three, trumpets, three, trombones, tuba, from, the, second, version, of, the, fourth, timpani, and, strings, the, later, symphonies, increase, this, complement, but, not, by, much, notable, is, the, use, of, wagner, tubas, in, his, last, three, symphonies, only, the, eighth, has, harp, and, percussion, besides, timpani, in, all, versions, the, seventh, in, some, versions, features, a, single, cymbal, crash, alongside, a, triangle, roll, at, the, climax, of, the, second, movement, bruckner, s, style, of, orchestral, writing, was, criticized, by, his, viennese, contemporaries, eduard, hanslick, and, his, circle, but, by, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, musicologists, recognized, that, his, orchestration, was, modeled, after, the, sound, of, his, primary, instrument, the, pipe, organ, i, e, alternating, between, two, groups, of, instruments, as, when, changing, from, one, manual, of, the, organ, to, another, the, structure, of, bruckner, s, symphonies, is, in, a, way, an, extension, of, that, of, beethoven, s, symphonies, bruckner, s, symphonies, are, in, four, movements, nicholas, temperley, writes, in, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, 1980, that, bruckner, alone, succeeded, in, creating, a, new, school, of, symphonic, writing, some, have, classified, him, as, a, conservative, some, as, a, radical, really, he, was, neither, or, alternatively, was, a, fusion, of, both, is, music, though, wagnerian, in, its, orchestration, and, in, its, huge, rising, and, falling, periods, patently, has, its, roots, in, older, styles, bruckner, took, beethoven, s, ninth, symphony, as, his, starting, point, the, introduction, to, the, first, movement, beginning, mysteriously, and, climbing, slowly, with, fragments, of, the, first, theme, to, the, gigantic, full, statement, of, that, theme, was, taken, over, by, bruckner, so, was, the, awe, inspiring, coda, of, the, first, movement, the, scherzo, and, slow, movement, with, their, alternation, of, melodies, are, models, for, bruckner, s, spacious, middle, movements, while, the, finale, with, a, grand, culminating, hymn, is, a, feature, of, almost, every, bruckner, symphony, bruckner, is, the, first, composer, since, schubert, about, whom, it, is, possible, to, make, such, generalizations, his, symphonies, deliberately, followed, a, pattern, each, one, building, on, the, achievements, of, its, predecessors, his, melodic, and, harmonic, style, changed, little, and, it, had, as, much, of, schubert, in, it, as, of, wagner, his, technique, in, the, development, and, transformation, of, themes, learnt, from, beethoven, liszt, and, wagner, was, unsurpassed, and, he, was, almost, the, equal, of, brahms, in, the, art, of, melodic, variation, deryck, cooke, adds, also, in, the, new, grove, despite, its, general, debt, to, beethoven, and, wagner, the, bruckner, symphony, is, a, unique, conception, not, only, because, of, the, individuality, of, its, spirit, and, its, materials, but, even, more, because, of, the, absolute, originality, of, its, formal, processes, at, first, these, processes, seemed, so, strange, and, unprecedented, that, they, were, taken, as, evidence, of, sheer, incompetence, now, it, is, recognized, that, bruckner, s, unorthodox, structural, methods, were, inevitable, bruckner, created, a, new, and, monumental, type, of, symphonic, organism, which, abjured, the, tense, dynamic, continuity, of, beethoven, and, the, broad, fluid, continuity, of, wagner, in, order, to, express, something, profoundly, different, from, either, composer, something, elemental, and, metaphysical, in, a, concert, review, bernard, holland, described, parts, of, the, first, movements, of, bruckner, s, sixth, and, seventh, symphonies, as, follows, there, is, the, same, slow, broad, introduction, the, drawn, out, climaxes, that, grow, pull, back, and, then, grow, some, more, a, sort, of, musical, coitus, interruptus, in, the, 2001, second, edition, of, the, new, grove, mark, evan, bonds, called, the, bruckner, symphonies, monumental, in, scope, and, design, combining, lyricism, with, an, inherently, polyphonic, design, bruckner, favored, an, approach, to, large, scale, form, that, relied, more, on, large, scale, thematic, and, harmonic, juxtaposition, over, the, course, of, his, output, one, senses, an, ever, increasing, interest, in, cyclic, integration, that, culminates, in, his, masterpiece, the, symphony, no, 8, in, c, minor, a, work, whose, final, page, integrates, the, main, themes, of, all, four, movements, simultaneously, in, 1990, the, american, artist, jack, ox, gave, a, paper, called, the, systematic, translation, of, anton, bruckner, s, eighth, symphony, into, a, series, of, thirteen, paintings, at, the, bruckner, symposium, in, linz, austria, here, she, structurally, analyzed, all, of, the, eighth, symphony, s, themes, she, then, proceeded, to, show, how, she, mapped, this, musical, data, into, a, series, of, twelve, large, painted, visualizations, the, conference, report, was, published, in, 1993, the, bruckner, problem, refers, to, the, difficulties, and, complications, resulting, from, the, numerous, contrasting, versions, and, editions, that, exist, for, most, of, the, symphonies, the, term, gained, currency, following, the, publication, in, 1969, of, an, article, dealing, with, the, subject, the, bruckner, problem, simplified, by, musicologist, deryck, cooke, which, brought, the, issue, to, the, attention, of, english, speaking, musicians, the, first, versions, of, bruckner, s, symphonies, often, presented, an, instrumental, contrapuntal, and, rhythmic, complexity, brucknerian, rhythm, 2, 3, use, of, quintuplets, the, originality, of, which, has, not, been, understood, and, which, were, considered, unperformable, by, the, musicians, in, order, to, make, them, performable, the, symphonies, except, symphonies, no, 5, no, 6, and, no, 7, have, been, revised, several, times, consequently, there, are, several, versions, and, editions, mainly, of, symphonies, 3, 4, and, 8, which, have, been, deeply, emended, by, bruckner, s, friends, and, associates, and, it, is, not, always, possible, to, tell, whether, the, emendations, had, bruckner, s, direct, authorization, looking, for, authentic, versions, of, the, symphonies, robert, haas, produced, during, the, 1930s, a, first, critical, edition, of, bruckner, s, works, based, on, the, original, scores, after, world, war, ii, other, scholars, leopold, nowak, william, carragan, benjamin, gunnar, cohrs, et, al, carried, on, with, this, work, bruckner, was, a, devoutly, religious, man, and, composed, numerous, sacred, works, he, wrote, a, te, deum, five, psalm, settings,
