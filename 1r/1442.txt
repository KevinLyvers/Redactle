council, however, as, his, father, was, only, in, his, forties, it, was, expected, that, it, would, be, many, years, before, nicholas, succeeded, to, the, throne, sergei, witte, russia, s, finance, minister, saw, things, differently, and, suggested, to, the, tsar, that, nicholas, be, appointed, to, the, siberian, railway, committee, alexander, argued, that, nicholas, was, not, mature, enough, to, take, on, serious, responsibilities, having, once, stated, nikki, is, a, good, boy, but, he, has, a, poet, s, soul, god, help, him, witte, stated, that, if, nicholas, was, not, introduced, to, state, affairs, he, would, never, be, ready, to, understand, them, alexander, s, assumptions, that, he, would, live, a, long, life, and, had, years, to, prepare, nicholas, for, becoming, tsar, proved, wrong, as, by, 1894, alexander, s, health, was, failing, in, april, 1894, nicholas, joined, his, uncle, sergei, and, aunt, elizabeth, on, a, journey, to, coburg, germany, for, the, wedding, of,

the, duke, and, duchess, of, saxe, coburg, and, gotha, once, in, coburg, nicholas, proposed, to, alix, but, she, rejected, his, proposal, being, reluctant, to, convert, to, orthodoxy, but, the, kaiser, later, informed, her, she, had, a, duty, to, marry, nicholas, and, to, convert, as, her, sister, elizabeth, had, done, in, 1892, thus, once, she, changed, her, mind, nicholas, and, alix, became, officially, engaged, on, 20, april, 1894, nicholas, s, parents, initially, hesitated, to, give, the, engagement, their, blessing, as, alix, had, made, poor, impressions, during, her, visits, to, russia, they, gave, their, consent, only, when, they, saw, tsar, alexander, s, health, deteriorating, that, summer, nicholas, travelled, to, england, to, visit, both, alix, and, the, queen, the, visit, coincided, with, the, birth, of, the, duke, and, duchess, of, york, s, first, child, the, future, king, edward, viii, along, with, being, present, at, the, christening, nicholas, and, alix,

mikhailovich, sandro, by, that, autumn, alexander, iii, lay, dying, upon, learning, that, he, would, live, only, a, fortnight, the, tsar, had, nicholas, summon, alix, to, the, livadia, palace, alix, arrived, on, 22, october, the, tsar, insisted, on, receiving, her, in, full, uniform, from, his, deathbed, he, told, his, son, to, heed, the, advice, of, witte, his, most, capable, minister, ten, days, later, alexander, iii, died, at, the, age, of, forty, nine, leaving, twenty, six, year, old, nicholas, as, emperor, of, russia, that, evening, nicholas, was, consecrated, by, his, father, s, priest, as, tsar, nicholas, ii, and, the, following, day, alix, was, received, into, the, russian, orthodox, church, taking, the, name, alexandra, feodorovna, with, the, title, of, grand, duchess, and, the, style, of, imperial, highness, nicholas, may, have, felt, unprepared, for, the, duties, of, the, crown, for, he, asked, his, cousin, and, brother, in, law, grand, duke, alexander, what, is, going, to, happen, to, me, and, all, of, russia, though, perhaps, under, prepared, and, unskilled, nicholas, was, not, altogether, untrained, for, his, duties, as, tsar, nicholas, chose, to, maintain, the, conservative, policies, favoured, by, his, father, throughout, his, reign, while, alexander, iii, had, concentrated, on, the, formulation, of, general, policy, nicholas, devoted, much, more, attention, to, the, details, of, administration, leaving, livadia, on, 7, november, tsar, alexander, s, funeral, procession, which, included, nicholas, s, maternal, aunt, through, marriage, and, paternal, first, cousin, once, removed, queen, olga, of, greece, and, the, prince, and, princess, of, wales, arrived, in, moscow, after, lying, in, state, in, the, kremlin, the, body, of, the, tsar, was, taken, to, st, petersburg, where, the, funeral, was, held, on, 19, november, nicholas, and, alix, s, wedding, was, originally, scheduled, for, the, spring, of, 1895, but, it, was, moved, forward, at, nicholas, s, insistence, staggering, under, the, weight, of, his, new, office, he, had, no, intention, of, allowing, the, one, person, who, gave, him, confidence, to, leave, his, side, instead, nicholas, s, wedding, to, alix, took, place, on, 26, november, 1894, which, was, the, birthday, of, the, dowager, empress, marie, feodorovna, and, court, mourning, could, be, slightly, relaxed, alexandra, wore, the, traditional, dress, of, romanov, brides, and, nicholas, a, hussar, s, uniform, nicholas, and, alexandra, each, holding, a, lit, candle, faced, the, palace, priest, and, were, married, a, few, minutes, before, one, in, the, afternoon, despite, a, visit, to, the, united, kingdom, in, 1893, where, he, observed, the, house, of, commons, in, debate, and, was, seemingly, impressed, by, the, machinery, of, constitutional, monarchy, nicholas, turned, his, back, on, any, notion, of, giving, away, any, power, to, elected, representatives, in, russia, shortly, after, he, came, to, the, throne, a, deputation, of, peasants, and, workers, from, various, towns, local, assemblies, zemstvos, came, to, the, winter, palace, proposing, court, reforms, such, as, the, adoption, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, and, reform, that, would, improve, the, political, and, economic, life, of, the, peasantry, in, the, tver, address, although, the, addresses, they, had, sent, in, beforehand, were, couched, in, mild, and, loyal, terms, nicholas, was, angry, and, ignored, advice, from, an, imperial, family, council, by, saying, to, them, it, has, come, to, my, knowledge, that, during, the, last, months, there, have, been, heard, in, some, assemblies, of, the, zemstvos, the, voices, of, those, who, have, indulged, in, a, senseless, dream, that, the, zemstvos, be, called, upon, to, participate, in, the, government, of, the, country, i, want, everyone, to, know, that, i, will, devote, all, my, strength, to, maintain, for, the, good, of, the, whole, nation, the, principle, of, absolute, autocracy, as, firmly, and, as, strongly, as, did, my, late, lamented, father, on, 26, may, 1896, nicholas, s, formal, coronation, as, tsar, was, held, in, uspensky, cathedral, located, within, the, kremlin, in, a, celebration, on, 30, may, 1896, a, large, festival, with, food, free, beer, and, souvenir, cups, was, held, in, khodynka, field, outside, moscow, khodynka, was, chosen, as, the, location, as, it, was, the, only, place, near, moscow, large, enough, to, hold, all, of, the, moscow, citizens, khodynka, was, primarily, used, as, a, military, training, ground, and, the, field, was, uneven, with, trenches, before, the, food, and, drink, was, handed, out, rumours, spread, that, there, would, not, be, enough, for, everyone, as, a, result, the, crowd, rushed, to, get, their, share, and, individuals, were, tripped, and, trampled, upon, suffocating, in, the, dirt, of, the, field, of, the, approximate, 100, 000, in, attendance, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 389, individuals, died, and, roughly, 1, 300, were, injured, the, khodynka, tragedy, was, seen, as, an, ill, omen, and, nicholas, found, gaining, popular, trust, difficult, from, the, beginning, of, his, reign, the, french, ambassador, s, gala, was, planned, for, that, night, the, tsar, wanted, to, stay, in, his, chambers, and, pray, for, the, lives, lost, but, his, uncles, believed, that, his, absence, at, the, ball, would, strain, relations, with, france, particularly, the, 1894, franco, russian, alliance, thus, nicholas, attended, the, party, as, a, result, the, mourning, populace, saw, nicholas, as, frivolous, and, uncaring, during, the, autumn, after, the, coronation, nicholas, and, alexandra, made, a, tour, of, europe, after, making, visits, to, the, emperor, and, empress, of, austria, hungary, the, kaiser, of, germany, and, nicholas, s, danish, grandparents, and, relatives, nicholas, and, alexandra, took, possession, of, their, new, yacht, the, standart, which, had, been, built, in, denmark, from, there, they, made, a, journey, to, scotland, to, spend, some, time, with, queen, victoria, at, balmoral, castle, while, alexandra, enjoyed, her, reunion, with, her, grandmother, nicholas, complained, in, a, letter, to, his, mother, about, being, forced, to, go, shooting, with, his, uncle, the, prince, of, wales, in, bad, weather, and, was, suffering, from, a, bad, toothache, the, first, years, of, his, reign, saw, little, more, than, continuation, and, development, of, the, policy, pursued, by, alexander, iii, nicholas, allotted, money, for, the, all, russia, exhibition, of, 1896, in, 1897, restoration, of, the, gold, standard, by, sergei, witte, minister, of, finance, completed, the, series, of, financial, reforms, initiated, fifteen, years, earlier, by, 1902, the, trans, siberian, railway, was, nearing, completion, this, helped, the, russians, trade, in, the, far, east, but, the, railway, still, required, huge, amounts, of, work, nicholas, always, believed, god, chose, him, to, be, the, tsar, and, therefore, the, decisions, of, the, tsar, reflected, the, will, of, god, and, could, not, be, disputed, he, was, convinced, that, the, simple, people, of, russia, understood, this, and, loved, him, as, demonstrated, by, the, display, of, affection, he, perceived, when, he, made, public, appearances, his, old, fashioned, belief, made, for, a, very, stubborn, ruler, who, rejected, constitutional, limitations, on, his, power, it, put, the, tsar, at, variance, with, the, emerging, political, consensus, among, the, russian, elite, it, was, further, belied, by, the, subordinate, position, of, the, church, in, the, bureaucracy, the, result, was, a, new, distrust, between, the, tsar, and, the, church, hierarchy, and, between, those, hierarchs, and, the, people, thereby, the, tsar, s, base, of, support, was, conflicted, in, 1903, nicholas, threw, himself, into, an, ecclesiastical, crisis, regarding, the, canonisation, of, seraphim, of, sarov, the, previous, year, it, had, been, suggested, that, if, he, were, canonised, the, imperial, couple, would, beget, a, son, and, heir, to, throne, while, alexandra, demanded, in, july, 1902, that, seraphim, be, canonised, in, less, than, a, week, nicholas, demanded, that, he, be, canonised, within, a, year, despite, a, public, outcry, the, church, bowed, to, the, intense, imperial, pressure, declaring, seraphim, worthy, of, canonisation, in, january, 1903, that, summer, the, imperial, family, travelled, to, sarov, for, the, canonisation, according, to, his, biographer, emperor, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, paid, a, state, visit, in, april, 1897, that, was, a, success, it, produced, a, gentlemen, s, agreement, to, keep, the, status, quo, in, the, balkans, and, a, somewhat, similar, commitment, became, applicable, to, constantinople, and, the, straits, the, result, was, years, of, peace, that, allowed, for, rapid, economic, growth, nicholas, followed, the, policies, of, his, father, strengthening, the, franco, russian, alliance, and, pursuing, a, policy, of, general, european, pacification, which, culminated, in, the, famous, hague, peace, conference, this, conference, suggested, and, promoted, by, nicholas, ii, was, convened, with, the, view, of, terminating, the, arms, race, and, setting, up, machinery, for, the, peaceful, settlement, of, international, disputes, the, results, of, the, conference, were, less, than, expected, due, to, the, mutual, distrust, existing, between, great, powers, nevertheless, the, hague, conventions, were, among, the, first, formal, statements, of, the, laws, of, war, nicholas, ii, became, the, hero, of, the, dedicated, disciples, of, peace, in, 1901, he, and, the, russian, diplomat, friedrich, martens, were, nominated, for, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, the, initiative, to, convene, the, hague, peace, conference, and, contributing, to, its, implementation, however, historian, dan, l, morrill, states, that, most, scholars, agree, that, the, invitation, was, conceived, in, fear, brought, forth, in, deceit, and, swaddled, in, humanitarian, ideals, not, from, humanitarianism, not, from, love, for, mankind, nicholas, aimed, to, strengthen, the, franco, russian, alliance, and, proposed, the, unsuccessful, hague, convention, of, 1899, to, promote, disarmament, and, peacefully, solve, international, disputes, a, clash, between, russia, and, the, empire, of, japan, was, almost, inevitable, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, russia, had, expanded, in, the, far, east, and, the, growth, of, its, settlement, and, territorial, ambitions, as, its, southward, path, to, the, balkans, was, frustrated, conflicted, with, japan, s, own, territorial, ambitions, on, the, asian, mainland, nicholas, pursued, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, with, regards, to, manchuria, and, korea, and, strongly, supported, the, scheme, for, timber, concessions, in, these, areas, as, developed, by, the, bezobrazov, group, before, the, war, in, 1901, nicholas, told, his, brother, in, law, prince, henry, of, prussia, i, do, not, want, to, seize, korea, but, under, no, circumstances, can, i, allow, japan, to, become, firmly, established, there, that, will, be, a, casus, belli, war, began, in, february, 1904, with, a, preemptive, japanese, attack, on, the, russian, pacific, fleet, in, port, arthur, prior, to, a, formal, declaration, of, war, with, the, russian, far, east, fleet, trapped, at, port, arthur, the, only, other, russian, fleet, was, the, baltic, fleet, it, was, half, a, world, away, but, the, decision, was, made, to, send, the, fleet, on, a, nine, month, voyage, to, the, east, the, united, kingdom, would, not, allow, the, russian, navy, to, use, the, suez, canal, due, to, its, alliance, with, the, empire, of, japan, and, due, to, the, dogger, bank, incident, where, the, baltic, fleet, mistakenly, fired, on, british, fishing, boats, in, the, north, sea, the, baltic, fleet, traversed, the, world, to, lift, the, blockade, on, port, arthur, but, after, many, misadventures, on, the, way, was, nearly, annihilated, by, the, japanese, in, the, battle, of, tsushima, on, land, the, imperial, russian, army, experienced, logistical, problems, while, commands, and, supplies, came, from, st, petersburg, combat, took, place, in, east, asian, ports, with, only, the, trans, siberian, railway, for, transport, of, supplies, as, well, as, troops, both, ways, the, 9, 200, kilometre, 5, 700, mi, rail, line, between, st, petersburg, and, port, arthur, was, single, track, with, no, track, around, lake, baikal, allowing, only, gradual, build, up, of, the, forces, on, the, front, besieged, port, arthur, fell, to, the, japanese, after, nine, months, of, resistance, as, russia, faced, imminent, defeat, by, the, japanese, the, call, for, peace, grew, nicholas, s, mother, as, well, as, his, cousin, emperor, wilhelm, ii, urged, nicholas, to, negotiate, for, peace, despite, the, efforts, nicholas, remained, evasive, sending, a, telegram, to, the, kaiser, on, 10, october, that, it, was, his, intent, to, keep, on, fighting, until, the, japanese, were, driven, from, manchuria, it, was, not, until, 27, 28, may, 1905, and, the, annihilation, of, the, russian, fleet, by, the, japanese, that, nicholas, finally, decided, to, sue, for, peace, nicholas, ii, accepted, american, mediation, appointing, sergei, witte, chief, plenipotentiary, for, the, peace, talks, the, war, was, ended, by, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, nicholas, s, stance, on, the, war, was, so, at, variance, with, the, obvious, facts, that, many, observers, were, baffled, he, saw, the, war, as, an, easy, god, given, victory, that, would, raise, russian, morale, and, patriotism, he, ignored, the, financial, repercussions, of, a, long, distance, war, rotem, kowner, argues, that, during, his, visit, to, japan, in, 1891, where, nicholas, was, attacked, by, a, japanese, policeman, he, regarded, the, japanese, as, small, of, stature, feminine, weak, and, inferior, he, ignored, reports, of, the, prowess, of, japanese, soldiers, in, the, first, sino, japanese, war, 1894, 95, and, reports, on, the, capabilities, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, as, well, as, negative, reports, on, the, lack, of, readiness, of, russian, forces, before, the, japanese, attack, on, port, arthur, nicholas, held, firm, to, the, belief, that, there, would, be, no, war, despite, the, onset, of, the, war, and, the, many, defeats, russia, suffered, nicholas, still, believed, in, and, expected, a, final, victory, maintaining, an, image, of, the, racial, inferiority, and, military, weakness, of, the, japanese, throughout, the, war, the, tsar, demonstrated, total, confidence, in, russia, s, ultimate, triumph, his, advisors, never, gave, him, a, clear, picture, of, russia, s, weaknesses, despite, the, continuous, military, disasters, nicholas, believed, victory, was, near, at, hand, losing, his, navy, at, tsushima, finally, persuaded, him, to, agree, to, peace, negotiations, even, then, he, insisted, on, the, option, of, reopening, hostilities, if, peace, conditions, were, unfavorable, he, forbade, his, chief, negotiator, count, witte, to, agree, to, either, indemnity, payments, or, loss, of, territory, nicholas, remained, adamantly, opposed, to, any, concessions, peace, was, made, but, witte, did, so, by, disobeying, the, tsar, and, ceding, southern, sakhalin, to, japan, the, kishinev, newspaper, bessarabets, which, published, anti, semitic, materials, received, funds, from, viacheslav, plehve, minister, of, the, interior, these, publications, served, to, fuel, the, kishinev, pogrom, rioting, the, government, of, nicholas, ii, formally, condemned, the, rioting, and, dismissed, the, regional, governor, with, the, perpetrators, arrested, and, punished, by, the, court, leadership, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, also, condemned, anti, semitic, pogroms, appeals, to, the, faithful, condemning, the, pogroms, were, read, publicly, in, all, churches, of, russia, in, private, nicholas, expressed, his, admiration, for, the, mobs, viewing, anti, semitism, as, a, useful, tool, for, unifying, the, people, behind, the, government, however, in, 1911, following, the, assassination, of, pyotr, stolypin, by, the, jewish, revolutionary, dmitry, bogrov, he, approved, of, government, efforts, to, prevent, anti, semitic, pogroms, in, finland, nicholas, had, become, associated, with, deeply, unpopular, russification, measures, these, began, with, the, february, manifesto, proclaimed, by, nicholas, ii, in, 1899, which, restricted, finland, s, autonomy, and, instigated, a, period, of, censorship, and, political, repression, a, petition, of, protest, signed, by, more, than, 500, 000, finns, was, collected, against, the, manifesto, and, delivered, to, st, petersburg, by, a, delegation, of, 500, people, but, they, were, not, received, by, nicholas, russification, measures, were, reintroduced, in, 1908, after, a, temporary, suspension, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1905, revolution, and, nicholas, received, an, icy, reception, when, he, made, his, only, visit, to, helsinki, on, 10, march, 1915, a, few, days, prior, to, bloody, sunday, 9, 22, january, 1905, priest, and, labor, leader, georgy, gapon, informed, the, government, of, the, forthcoming, procession, to, the, winter, palace, to, hand, a, workers, petition, to, the, tsar, on, saturday, 8, 21, january, the, ministers, convened, to, consider, the, situation, there, was, never, any, thought, that, the, tsar, who, had, left, the, capital, for, tsarskoye, selo, on, the, advice, of, the, ministers, would, actually, meet, gapon, the, suggestion, that, some, other, member, of, the, imperial, family, receive, the, petition, was, rejected, finally, informed, by, the, prefect, of, police, that, he, lacked, the, men, to, pluck, gapon, from, among, his, followers, and, place, him, under, arrest, the, newly, appointed, minister, of, the, interior, prince, sviatopolk, mirsky, and, his, colleagues, decided, to, bring, additional, troops, to, reinforce, the, city, that, evening, nicholas, wrote, in, his, diary, troops, have, been, brought, from, the, outskirts, to, reinforce, the, garrison, up, to, now, the, workers, have, been, calm, their, number, is, estimated, at, 120, 000, at, the, head, of, their, union, is, a, kind, of, socialist, priest, named, gapon, mirsky, came, this, evening, to, present, his, report, on, the, measures, taken, on, sunday, 9, 22, january, 1905, gapon, began, his, march, locking, arms, the, workers, marched, peacefully, through, the, streets, some, carried, religious, icons, and, banners, as, well, as, national, flags, and, portraits, of, the, tsar, as, they, walked, they, sang, hymns, and, god, save, the, tsar, at, 2, pm, all, of, the, converging, processions, were, scheduled, to, arrive, at, the, winter, palace, there, was, no, single, confrontation, with, the, troops, throughout, the, city, at, bridges, on, strategic, boulevards, the, marchers, found, their, way, blocked, by, lines, of, infantry, backed, by, cossacks, and, hussars, and, the, soldiers, opened, fire, on, the, crowd, the, official, number, of, victims, was, 92, dead, and, several, hundred, wounded, gapon, vanished, and, the, other, leaders, of, the, march, were, seized, expelled, from, the, capital, they, circulated, through, the, empire, increasing, the, casualties, as, bullets, riddled, their, icons, their, banners, and, their, portraits, of, nicholas, the, people, shrieked, the, tsar, will, not, help, us, outside, russia, the, future, british, labour, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, attacked, the, tsar, calling, him, a, blood, stained, creature, and, a, common, murderer, that, evening, nicholas, wrote, in, his, diary, difficult, day, in, st, petersburg, there, were, serious, disturbances, due, to, the, desire, of, workers, to, get, to, the, winter, palace, the, troops, had, to, shoot, in, different, places, of, the, city, there, were, many, dead, and, wounded, lord, how, painful, and, bad, his, younger, sister, grand, duchess, olga, alexandrovna, wrote, afterwards, nicky, had, the, police, report, a, few, days, before, that, saturday, he, telephoned, my, mother, at, the, anitchkov, and, said, that, she, and, i, were, to, leave, for, gatchina, at, once, he, and, alicky, went, to, tsarskoye, selo, insofar, as, i, remember, my, uncles, vladimir, and, nicholas, were, the, only, members, of, the, family, left, in, st, petersburg, but, there, may, have, been, others, i, felt, at, the, time, that, all, those, arrangements, were, hideously, wrong, nicky, s, ministers, and, the, chief, of, police, had, it, all, their, way, my, mother, and, i, wanted, him, to, stay, in, st, petersburg, and, to, face, the, crowd, i, am, positive, that, for, all, the, ugly, mood, of, some, of, the, workmen, nicky, s, appearance, would, have, calmed, them, they, would, have, presented, their, petition, and, gone, back, to, their, homes, but, that, wretched, epiphany, incident, had, left, all, the, senior, officials, in, a, state, of, panic, they, kept, on, telling, nicky, that, he, had, no, right, to, run, such, a, risk, that, he, owed, it, to, the, country, to, leave, the, capital, that, even, with, the, utmost, precautions, taken, there, might, always, be, some, loophole, left, my, mother, and, i, did, all, we, could, to, persuade, him, that, the, ministers, advice, was, wrong, but, nicky, preferred, to, follow, it, and, he, was, the, first, to, repent, when, he, heard, of, the, tragic, outcome, from, his, hiding, place, gapon, issued, a, letter, stating, nicholas, romanov, formerly, tsar, and, at, present, soul, murderer, of, the, russian, empire, the, innocent, blood, of, workers, their, wives, and, children, lies, forever, between, you, and, the, russian, people, may, all, the, blood, which, must, be, spilled, fall, upon, you, you, hangman, i, call, upon, all, the, socialist, parties, of, russia, to, come, to, an, immediate, agreement, among, themselves, and, bring, an, armed, uprising, against, tsarism, confronted, with, growing, opposition, and, after, consulting, with, witte, and, prince, sviatopolk, mirsky, the, tsar, issued, a, reform, ukase, on, 25, december, 1904, with, vague, promises, in, hopes, of, cutting, the, rebellion, short, many, demonstrators, were, shot, on, bloody, sunday, 1905, as, they, tried, to, march, to, the, winter, palace, in, st, petersburg, dmitri, feodorovich, trepov, was, ordered, to, take, drastic, measures, to, stop, the, revolutionary, activity, grand, duke, sergei, was, killed, in, february, by, a, revolutionary, s, bomb, in, moscow, as, he, left, the, kremlin, on, 3, march, the, tsar, condemned, the, revolutionaries, meanwhile, witte, recommended, that, a, manifesto, be, issued, schemes, of, reform, would, be, elaborated, by, ivan, goremykin, and, a, committee, consisting, of, elected, representatives, of, the, zemstvos, and, municipal, councils, under, the, presidency, of, witte, in, june, the, battleship, potemkin, part, of, the, black, sea, fleet, mutinied, around, august, september, after, his, diplomatic, success, on, ending, the, russo, japanese, war, witte, wrote, to, the, tsar, stressing, the, urgent, need, for, political, reforms, at, home, the, tsar, remained, quite, impassive, and, indulgent, he, spent, most, of, that, autumn, hunting, with, the, defeat, of, russia, by, a, non, western, power, the, prestige, and, authority, of, the, autocratic, regime, fell, significantly, tsar, nicholas, ii, taken, by, surprise, by, the, events, reacted, with, anger, and, bewilderment, he, wrote, to, his, mother, after, months, of, disorder, it, makes, me, sick, to, read, the, news, nothing, but, strikes, in, schools, and, factories, murdered, policemen, cossacks, and, soldiers, riots, disorder, mutinies, but, the, ministers, instead, of, acting, with, quick, decision, only, assemble, in, council, like, a, lot, of, frightened, hens, and, cackle, about, providing, united, ministerial, action, ominous, quiet, days, began, quiet, indeed, because, there, was, complete, order, in, the, streets, but, at, the, same, time, everybody, knew, that, something, was, going, to, happen, the, troops, were, waiting, for, the, signal, but, the, other, side, would, not, begin, one, had, the, same, feeling, as, before, a, thunderstorm, in, summer, everybody, was, on, edge, and, extremely, nervous, and, of, course, that, sort, of, strain, could, not, go, on, for, long, we, are, in, the, midst, of, a, revolution, with, an, administrative, apparatus, entirely, disorganized, and, in, this, lies, the, main, danger, in, october, a, railway, strike, developed, into, a, general, strike, which, paralysed, the, country, in, a, city, without, electricity, witte, told, nicholas, ii, that, the, country, was, at, the, verge, of, a, cataclysmic, revolution, the, tsar, accepted, the, draft, hurriedly, outlined, by, aleksei, d, obolensky, the, emperor, and, autocrat, of, all, the, russias, was, forced, to, sign, the, october, manifesto, agreeing, to, the, establishment, of, the, imperial, duma, and, to, give, up, part, of, his, unlimited, autocracy, the, freedom, of, religion, clause, outraged, the, church, because, it, allowed, people, to, switch, to, evangelical, protestantism, which, they, denounced, as, heresy, for, the, next, six, months, witte, was, the, prime, minister, according, to, harold, williams, that, government, was, almost, paralyzed, from, the, beginning, on, 8, november, 26, october, o, s, the, tsar, appointed, dmitri, feodorovich, trepov, master, of, the, palace, without, consulting, witte, and, had, daily, contact, with, the, emperor, his, influence, at, court, was, paramount, on, 14, november, 1905, 1, november, o, s, princess, milica, of, montenegro, presented, grigori, rasputin, to, tsar, nicholas, and, his, wife, who, by, then, had, a, hemophiliac, son, at, peterhof, palace, under, pressure, from, the, attempted, 1905, russian, revolution, on, 5, august, of, that, year, nicholas, ii, issued, a, manifesto, about, the, convocation, of, the, state, duma, known, as, the, bulygin, duma, initially, thought, to, be, an, advisory, organ, in, the, october, manifesto, the, tsar, pledged, to, introduce, basic, civil, liberties, provide, for, broad, participation, in, the, state, duma, and, endow, the, duma, with, legislative, and, oversight, powers, he, was, determined, however, to, preserve, his, autocracy, even, in, the, context, of, reform, this, was, signalled, in, the, text, of, the, 1906, constitution, he, was, described, as, the, supreme, autocrat, and, retained, sweeping, executive, powers, also, in, church, affairs, his, cabinet, ministers, were, not, allowed, to, interfere, with, nor, assist, one, another, they, were, responsible, only, to, him, nicholas, s, relations, with, the, duma, were, poor, the, first, duma, with, a, majority, of, kadets, almost, immediately, came, into, conflict, with, him, scarcely, had, the, 524, members, sat, down, at, the, tauride, palace, when, they, formulated, an, address, to, the, throne, it, demanded, universal, suffrage, radical, land, reform, the, release, of, all, political, prisoners, and, the, dismissal, of, ministers, appointed, by, the, tsar, in, favour, of, ministers, acceptable, to, the, duma, grand, duchess, olga, nicholas, s, sister, later, wrote, there, was, such, gloom, at, tsarskoye, selo, i, did, not, understand, anything, about, politics, i, just, felt, everything, was, going, wrong, with, the, country, and, all, of, us, the, october, constitution, did, not, seem, to, satisfy, anyone, i, went, with, my, mother, to, the, first, duma, i, remember, the, large, group, of, deputies, from, among, peasants, and, factory, people, the, peasants, looked, sullen, but, the, workmen, were, worse, they, looked, as, though, they, hated, us, i, remember, the, distress, in, alicky, s, eyes, minister, of, the, court, count, vladimir, frederiks, commented, the, deputies, they, give, one, the, impression, of, a, gang, of, criminals, who, are, only, waiting, for, the, signal, to, throw, themselves, upon, the, ministers, and, cut, their, throats, i, will, never, again, set, foot, among, those, people, the, dowager, empress, noticed, incomprehensible, hatred, although, nicholas, initially, had, a, good, relationship, with, his, prime, minister, sergei, witte, alexandra, distrusted, him, as, he, had, instigated, an, investigation, of, grigori, rasputin, and, as, the, political, situation, deteriorated, nicholas, dissolved, the, duma, the, duma, was, populated, with, radicals, many, of, whom, wished, to, push, through, legislation, that, would, abolish, private, property, ownership, among, other, things, witte, unable, to, grasp, the, seemingly, insurmountable, problems, of, reforming, russia, and, the, monarchy, wrote, to, nicholas, on, 14, april, 1906, resigning, his, office, however, other, accounts, have, said, that, witte, was, forced, to, resign, by, the, emperor, nicholas, was, not, ungracious, to, witte, and, an, imperial, rescript, was, published, on, 22, april, creating, witte, a, knight, of, the, order, of, saint, alexander, nevsky, with, diamonds, the, last, two, words, were, written, in, the, emperor, s, own, hand, followed, by, i, remain, unalterably, well, disposed, to, you, and, sincerely, grateful, for, ever, more, nicholas, a, second, duma, met, for, the, first, time, in, february, 1907, the, leftist, parties, including, the, social, democrats, and, the, socialist, revolutionaries, who, had, boycotted, the, first, duma, had, won, 200, seats, in, the, second, more, than, a, third, of, the, membership, again, nicholas, waited, impatiently, to, rid, himself, of, the, duma, in, two, letters, to, his, mother, he, let, his, bitterness, flow, a, grotesque, deputation, is, coming, from, england, to, see, liberal, members, of, the, duma, uncle, bertie, informed, us, that, they, were, very, sorry, but, were, unable, to, take, action, to, stop, their, coming, their, famous, liberty, of, course, how, angry, they, would, be, if, a, deputation, went, from, us, to, the, irish, to, wish, them, success, in, their, struggle, against, their, government, a, little, while, later, he, further, wrote, all, would, be, well, if, everything, said, in, the, duma, remained, within, its, walls, every, word, spoken, however, comes, out, in, the, next, day, s, papers, which, are, avidly, read, by, everyone, in, many, places, the, populace, is, getting, restive, again, they, begin, to, talk, about, land, once, more, and, are, waiting, to, see, what, the, duma, is, going, to, say, on, the, question, i, am, getting, telegrams, from, everywhere, petitioning, me, to, order, a, dissolution, but, it, is, too, early, for, that, one, has, to, let, them, do, something, manifestly, stupid, or, mean, and, then, slap, and, they, are, gone, after, the, second, duma, resulted, in, similar, problems, the, new, prime, minister, pyotr, stolypin, whom, witte, described, as, reactionary, unilaterally, dissolved, it, and, changed, the, electoral, laws, to, allow, for, future, dumas, to, have, a, more, conservative, content, and, to, be, dominated, by, the, liberal, conservative, octobrist, party, of, alexander, guchkov, stolypin, a, skilful, politician, had, ambitious, plans, for, reform, these, included, making, loans, available, to, the, lower, classes, to, enable, them, to, buy, land, with, the, intent, of, forming, a, farming, class, loyal, to, the, crown, nevertheless, when, the, duma, remained, hostile, stolypin, had, no, qualms, about, invoking, article, 87, of, the, fundamental, laws, which, empowered, the, tsar, to, issue, urgent, and, extraordinary, emergency, decrees, during, the, recess, of, the, state, duma, stolypin, s, most, famous, legislative, act, the, change, in, peasant, land, tenure, was, promulgated, under, article, 87, the, third, duma, remained, an, independent, body, this, time, the, members, proceeded, cautiously, instead, of, hurling, themselves, at, the, government, opposing, parties, within, the, duma, worked, to, develop, the, body, as, a, whole, in, the, classic, manner, of, the, british, parliament, the, duma, reached, for, power, grasping, for, the, national, purse, strings, the, duma, had, the, right, to, question, ministers, behind, closed, doors, as, to, their, proposed, expenditures, these, sessions, endorsed, by, stolypin, were, educational, for, both, sides, and, in, time, mutual, antagonism, was, replaced, by, mutual, respect, even, the, sensitive, area, of, military, expenditure, where, the, october, manifesto, clearly, had, reserved, decisions, to, the, throne, a, duma, commission, began, to, operate, composed, of, aggressive, patriots, no, less, anxious, than, nicholas, to, restore, the, fallen, honour, of, russian, arms, the, duma, commission, frequently, recommended, expenditures, even, larger, than, those, proposed, with, the, passage, of, time, nicholas, also, began, to, have, confidence, in, the, duma, this, duma, cannot, be, reproached, with, an, attempt, to, seize, power, and, there, is, no, need, at, all, to, quarrel, with, it, he, said, to, stolypin, in, 1909, nevertheless, stolypin, s, plans, were, undercut, by, conservatives, at, court, although, the, tsar, at, first, supported, him, he, finally, sided, with, the, arch, critics, reactionaries, such, as, prince, vladimir, nikolayevich, orlov, never, tired, of, telling, the, tsar, that, the, very, existence, of, the, duma, was, a, blot, on, the, autocracy, stolypin, they, whispered, was, a, traitor, and, secret, revolutionary, who, was, conniving, with, the, duma, to, steal, the, prerogatives, assigned, the, tsar, by, god, witte, also, engaged, in, constant, intrigue, against, stolypin, although, stolypin, had, had, nothing, to, do, with, witte, s, fall, witte, blamed, him, stolypin, had, unwittingly, angered, the, tsaritsa, he, had, ordered, an, investigation, into, rasputin, and, presented, it, to, the, tsar, who, read, it, but, did, nothing, stolypin, on, his, own, authority, ordered, rasputin, to, leave, st, petersburg, alexandra, protested, vehemently, but, nicholas, refused, to, overrule, his, prime, minister, who, had, more, influence, with, the, emperor, by, the, time, of, stolypin, s, assassination, in, september, 1911, stolypin, had, grown, weary, of, the, burdens, of, office, for, a, man, who, preferred, clear, decisive, action, working, with, a, sovereign, who, believed, in, fatalism, and, mysticism, was, frustrating, as, an, example, nicholas, once, returned, a, document, unsigned, with, the, note, despite, most, convincing, arguments, in, favour, of, adopting, a, positive, decision, in, this, matter, an, inner, voice, keeps, on, insisting, more, and, more, that, i, do, not, accept, responsibility, for, it, so, far, my, conscience, has, not, deceived, me, therefore, i, intend, in, this, case, to, follow, its, dictates, i, know, that, you, too, believe, that, a, tsar, s, heart, is, in, god, s, hands, let, it, be, so, for, all, laws, established, by, me, i, bear, a, great, responsibility, before, god, and, i, am, ready, to, answer, for, my, decision, at, any, time, alexandra, believing, that, stolypin, had, severed, the, bonds, that, her, son, depended, on, for, life,

years, earlier, when, stolypin, had, casually, mentioned, resigning, to, nicholas, he, was, informed, this, is, not, a, question, of, confidence, or, lack, of, it, it, is, my, will, remember, that, we, live, in, russia, not, abroad, and, therefore, i, shall, not, consider, the, possibility, of, any, resignation, he, was, assassinated, in, september, 1911, in, 1912, a, fourth, duma, was, elected, with, almost, the, same, membership, as, the, third, the, duma, started, too, fast, now, it, is, slower, but, better, and, more, lasting, stated, nicholas, to, sir, bernard, pares, the, first, world,

only, surviving, uncle, was, deputed, to, beg, nicholas, to, grant, a, constitution, and, a, government, responsible, to, the, duma, nicholas, sternly, and, adamantly, refused, reproaching, his, uncle, for, asking, him, to, break, his, coronation, oath, to, maintain, autocratic, power, for, his, successors, in, the, duma, on, 2, december, 1916, vladimir, purishkevich, a, fervent, patriot,

warned, and, an, obscure, peasant, shall, govern, russia, no, longer, further, complicating, domestic, matters, was, the, matter, of, the, succession, alexandra, bore, nicholas, four, daughters, grand, duchess, olga, in, 1895, grand, duchess, tatiana, in, 1897, grand, duchess, maria, in, 1899, and, grand, duchess, anastasia, in, 1901, before, their, son, alexei, was, born, on, 12, august, 1904, the, young, heir, was, afflicted, with, hemophilia, b, a, hereditary, disease, that, prevents, blood, from, clotting, properly, which, at, that, time, was, untreatable, and, usually, led, to, an, untimely, death, as, a, granddaughter, of, queen, victoria, alexandra, carried, the, same, gene, mutation, that, afflicted, several, of, the, major, european, royal, houses, such, as, prussia, and, spain, hemophilia, therefore, became, known, as, the, royal, disease, through, alexandra, the, disease, had, passed, on, to, her, son, as, all, of, nicholas, and, alexandra, s, daughters, were, assassinated, with, their, parents, and, brother, in, yekaterinburg, in, 1918, it, is, not, known, whether, any, of, them, inherited, the, gene, as, carriers, before, rasputin, s, arrival, the, tsarina, and, the, tsar, had, consulted, numerous, mystics, charlatans, holy, fools, and, miracle, workers, the, royal, behavior, was, not, some, odd, aberration, but, a, deliberate, retreat, from, the, secular, social, and, economic, forces, of, his, time, an, act, of, faith, and, vote, of, confidence, in, a, spiritual, past, they, had, set, themselves, up, for, the, greatest, spiritual, advisor, and, manipulator, in, russian, history, because, of, the, fragility, of, the, autocracy, at, this, time, nicholas, and, alexandra, chose, to, keep, secret, alexei, s, condition, even, within, the, household, many, were, unaware, of, the, exact, nature, of, the, tsarevich, s, illness, at, first, alexandra, turned, to, russian, doctors, and, medics, to, treat, alexei, however, their, treatments, generally, failed, and, alexandra, increasingly, turned, to, mystics, and, holy, men, or, starets, as, they, were, called, in, russian, one, of, these, starets, an, illiterate, siberian, named, grigori, rasputin, gained, amazing, success, rasputin, s, influence, over, empress, alexandra, and, consequently, the, tsar, himself, grew, even, stronger, after, 1912, when, the, tsarevich, nearly, died, from, an, injury, his, bleeding, grew, steadily, worse, as, doctors, despaired, and, priests, administered, the, last, sacrament, in, desperation, alexandra, called, upon, rasputin, to, which, he, replied, god, has, seen, your, tears, and, heard, your, prayers, do, not, grieve, the, little, one, will, not, die, do, not, allow, the, doctors, to, bother, him, too, much, the, hemorrhage, stopped, the, very, next, day, and, the, boy, began, to, recover, alexandra, took, this, as, a, sign, that, rasputin, was, a, starets, and, that, god, was, with, him, for, the, rest, of, her, life, she, would, fervently, defend, him, and, turn, her, wrath, against, anyone, who, dared, to, question, him, in, 1907, to, end, longstanding, controversies, over, central, asia, russia, and, the, united, kingdom, signed, the, anglo, russian, convention, that, resolved, most, of, the, problems, generated, for, decades, by, the, great, game, the, uk, had, already, entered, into, the, entente, cordiale, with, france, in, 1904, and, the, anglo, russian, convention, led, to, the, formation, of, the, triple, entente, the, following, year, in, may, 1908, nicholas, and, alexandra, s, shared, uncle, bertie, and, aunt, alix, britain, s, king, edward, vii, and, queen, alexandra, made, a, state, visit, to, russia, being, the, first, reigning, british, monarchs, to, do, so, however, they, did, not, set, foot, on, russian, soil, instead, they, stayed, aboard, their, yachts, meeting, off, the, coast, of, modern, day, tallinn, later, that, year, nicholas, was, taken, off, guard, by, the, news, that, his, foreign, minister, alexander, izvolsky, had, entered, into, a, secret, agreement, with, the, austro, hungarian, foreign, minister, count, alois, von, aehrenthal, agreeing, that, in, exchange, for, russian, naval, access, to, the, dardanelles, and, the, bosporus, strait, russia, would, not, oppose, the, austrian, annexation, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, a, revision, of, the, 1878, treaty, of, berlin, when, austria, hungary, did, annex, this, territory, that, october, it, precipitated, the, bosnian, crisis, when, russia, protested, about, the, annexation, the, austrians, threatened, to, leak, secret, communications, between, izvolsky, and, aehrenthal, prompting, nicholas, to, complain, in, a, letter, to, emperor, franz, joseph, about, a, breach, of, confidence, in, 1909, in, the, wake, of, the, anglo, russian, convention, the, russian, imperial, family, made, a, visit, to, england, staying, on, the, isle, of, wight, for, cowes, week, in, 1913, during, the, balkan, wars, nicholas, personally, offered, to, arbitrate, between, serbia, and, bulgaria, however, the, bulgarians, rejected, his, offer, also, in, 1913, nicholas, albeit, without, alexandra, made, a, visit, to, berlin, for, the, wedding, of, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, s, daughter, princess, victoria, louise, to, a, maternal, cousin, of, nicholas, ernest, augustus, duke, of, brunswick, nicholas, was,

retracing, the, route, down, the, volga, river, that, was, made, by, the, teenage, michael, romanov, from, the, ipatiev, monastery, in, kostroma, to, moscow, in, 1613, when, he, finally, agreed, to, become, tsar, on, 28, june, 1914, archduke, franz, ferdinand, of, austria, heir, to, the, austro, hungarian, throne, was, assassinated, by, a, bosnian, serb, nationalist, in, sarajevo, who, opposed, austria, hungary, s, annexation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, the, outbreak, of, war, was, not, inevitable, but, leaders, diplomats, and, nineteenth, century, alliances, created, a, climate, for, large, scale, conflict, the, concept, of, pan, slavism, and, shared, religion, created, strong, public, sympathy, between, russia, and, serbia, territorial, conflict, created, rivalries, between, germany, and, france, and, between, austria, hungary, and, serbia, and, as, a, consequence, alliance, networks, developed, across, europe, the, triple, entente, and, triple, alliance, networks, were, set, before, the, war, nicholas, wanted, neither, to, abandon, serbia, to, the, ultimatum, of, austria, hungary, nor, to, provoke, a, general, war, in, a, series, of, letters, exchanged, with, wilhelm, of, germany, the, willy, nicky, correspondence, the, two, proclaimed, their, desire, for, peace, and, each, attempted, to, get, the, other, to, back, down, nicholas, desired, that, russia, s, mobilization, be, only, against, austria, hungary, in, the, hopes, of, preventing, war, with, germany, on, 25, july, 1914, at, his, council, of, ministers, nicholas, decided, to, intervene, in, the, austro, serbian, conflict, a, step, toward, general, war, he, put, the, russian, army, on, alert, on, 25, july, although, this, was, not, general, mobilization, it, threatened, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, borders, and, looked, like, military, preparation, for, war, however, his, army, had, no, contingency, plans, for, a, partial, mobilization, and, on, 30, july, 1914, nicholas, took, the, fateful, step, of, confirming, the, order, for, general, mobilization, despite, being, strongly, counselled, against, it, on, 28, july, austria, hungary, formally, declared, war, against, serbia, on, 29, july, 1914, nicholas, sent, a, telegram, to, wilhelm, with, the, suggestion, to, submit, the, austro, serbian, problem, to, the, hague, conference, in, hague, tribunal, wilhelm, did, not, address, the, question, of, the, hague, conference, in, his, subsequent, reply, count, witte, told, the, french, ambassador, maurice, pal, ologue, that, from, russia, s, point, of, view, the, war, was, madness, slav, solidarity, was, simply, nonsense, and, russia, could, hope, for, nothing, from, the, war, on, 30, july, russia, ordered, general, mobilization, but, still, maintained, that, it, would, not, attack, if, peace, talks, were, to, begin, germany, reacting, to, the, discovery, of, partial, mobilization, ordered, on, 25, july, announced, its, own, pre, mobilization, posture, the, imminent, danger, of, war, germany, requested, that, russia, demobilize, within, the, next, twelve, hours, in, saint, petersburg, at, 7, pm, with, the, ultimatum, to, russia, having, expired, the, german, ambassador, to, russia, met, with, the, russian, foreign, minister, sergey, sazonov, asked, three, times, if, russia, would, reconsider, and, then, with, shaking, hands, delivered, the, note, accepting, russia, s, war, challenge, and, declaring, war, on, 1, august, germany, declared, war, on, russia, on, 1, august, and, its, ally, france, on, 3, august, less, than, a, week, later, on, 6, august, franz, joseph, signed, the, austro, hungarian, declaration, of, war, on, russia, the, outbreak, of, war, on, 1, august, 1914, found, russia, grossly, unprepared, russia, and, her, allies, placed, their, faith, in, her, army, the, famous, russian, steamroller, its, pre, war, regular, strength, was, 1, 400, 000, mobilization, added, 3, 100, 000, reserves, and, millions, more, stood, ready, behind, them, in, every, other, respect, however, russia, was, unprepared, for, war, germany, had, ten, times, as, much, railway, track, per, square, mile, and, whereas, russian, soldiers, travelled, an, average, of, 1, 290, kilometres, 800, mi, to, reach, the, front, german, soldiers, traveled, less, than, a, quarter, of, that, distance, russian, heavy, industry, was, still, too, small, to, equip, the, massive, armies, the, tsar, could, raise, and, her, reserves, of, munitions, were, pitifully, small, while, the, imperial, german, army, in, 1914, was, better, equipped, than, any, other, man, for, man, the, russians, were, severely, short, on, artillery, pieces, shells, motorized, transports, and, even, boots, with, the, baltic, sea, barred, by, german, u, boats, and, the, dardanelles, by, the, guns, of, germany, s, ally, the, ottoman, empire, russia, initially, could, receive, help, only, via, archangel, which, was, frozen, solid, in, winter, or, via, vladivostok, which, was, over, 6, 400, kilometres, 4, 000, mi, from, the, front, line, by, 1915, a, rail, line, was, built, north, from, petrozavodsk, to, the, kola, gulf, and, this, connection, laid, the, foundation, of, the, ice, free, port, of, what, eventually, was, called, murmansk, the, russian, high, command, was, moreover, greatly, weakened, by, the, mutual, contempt, between, vladimir, sukhomlinov, the, minister, of, war, and, the, incompetent, grand, duke, nicholas, nikolayevich, who, commanded, the, armies, in, the, field, in, spite, of, all, of, this, an, immediate, attack, was, ordered, against, the, german, province, of, east, prussia, the, germans, mobilised, there, with, great, efficiency, and, completely, defeated, the, two, russian, armies, which, had, invaded, the, battle, of, tannenberg, where, an, entire, russian, army, was, annihilated, cast, an, ominous, shadow, over, russia, s, future, russia, had, great, success, against, both, the, austro, hungarian, and, ottoman, armies, from, the, very, beginning, of, the, war, but, they, never, succeeded, against, the, might, of, the, german, army, in, september, 1914, to, relieve, pressure, on, france, the, russians, were, forced, to, halt, a, successful, offensive, against, austria, hungary, in, galicia, to, attack, german, held, silesia, gradually, a, war, of, attrition, set, in, on, the, vast, eastern, front, where, the, russians, were, facing, the, combined, forces, of, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, armies, and, they, suffered, staggering, losses, general, anton, denikin, retreating, from, galicia, wrote, the, german, heavy, artillery, swept, away, whole, lines, of, trenches, and, their, defenders, with, them, we, hardly, replied, there, was, nothing, with, which, we, could, reply, our, regiments, although, completely, exhausted, were, beating, off, one, attack, after, another, by, bayonet, blood, flowed, unendingly, the, ranks, became, thinner, and, thinner, and, thinner, the, number, of, graves, multiplied, on, 5, august, with, the, russian, army, in, retreat, warsaw, fell, defeat, at, the, front, bred, disorder, at, home, at, first, the, targets, were, german, and, for, three, days, in, june, shops, bakeries, factories, private, houses, and, country, estates, belonging, to, people, with, german, names, were, looted, and, burned, the, inflamed, mobs, then, turned, on, the, government, declaring, the, empress, should, be, shut, up, in, a, convent, the, tsar, deposed, and, rasputin, hanged, nicholas, was, by, no, means, deaf, to, these, discontents, an, emergency, session, of, the, duma, was, summoned, and, a, special, defense, council, established, its, members, drawn, from, the, duma, and, the, tsar, s, ministers, in, july, 1915, king, christian, x, of, denmark, first, cousin, of, the, tsar, sent, hans, niels, andersen, to, tsarskoye, selo, with, an, offer, to, act, as, a, mediator, he, made, several, trips, between, london, berlin, and, petrograd, and, in, july, saw, the, dowager, empress, maria, feodorovna, andersen, told, her, they, should, conclude, peace, nicholas, chose, to, turn, down, king, christian, s, offer, of, mediation, as, he, felt, it, would, be, a, betrayal, for, russia, to, form, a, separate, peace, treaty, with, the, central, powers, when, its, allies, britain, and, france, were, still, fighting, the, energetic, and, efficient, general, alexei, polivanov, replaced, sukhomlinov, as, minister, of, war, which, failed, to, improve, the, strategic, situation, in, the, aftermath, of, the, great, retreat, and, the, loss, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, nicholas, assumed, the, role, of, commander, in, chief, after, dismissing, his, cousin, grand, duke, nicholas, nikolayevich, in, september, 1915, this, was, a, mistake, as, the, tsar, came, to, be, personally, associated, with, the, continuing, losses, at, the, front, he, was, also, away, at, the, remote, hq, at, mogilev, far, from, the, direct, governance, of, the, empire, and, when, revolution, broke, out, in, petrograd, he, was, unable, to, halt, it, in, reality, the, move, was, largely, symbolic, since, all, important, military, decisions, were, made, by, his, chief, of, staff, general, michael, alexeiev, and, nicholas, did, little, more, than, review, troops, inspect, field, hospitals, and, preside, over, military, luncheons, the, duma, was, still, calling, for, political, reforms, and, political, unrest, continued, throughout, the, war, cut, off, from, public, opinion, nicholas, could, not, see, that, the, dynasty, was, tottering, with, nicholas, at, the, front, domestic, issues, and, control, of, the, capital, were, left, with, his, wife, alexandra, however, alexandra, s, relationship, with, grigori, rasputin, and, her, german, background, further, discredited, the, dynasty, s, authority, nicholas, had, been, repeatedly, warned, about, the, destructive, influence, of, rasputin, but, had, failed, to, remove, him, rumors, and, accusations, about, alexandra, and, rasputin, appeared, one, after, another, alexandra, was, even, accused, of, harboring, treasonous, sympathies, towards, germany, anger, at, nicholas, s, failure, to, act, and, the, extreme, damage, that, rasputin, s, influence, was, doing, to, russia, s, war, effort, and, to, the, monarchy, led, to, rasputin, s, eventual, murder, by, a, group, of, nobles, led, by, prince, felix, yusupov, and, grand, duke, dmitri, pavlovich, a, cousin, of, the, tsar, in, the, early, morning, of, saturday, 17, december, 1916, o, s, 30,

1916, authority, appeared, to, collapse, and, the, capital, was, left, in, the, hands, of, strikers, and, mutineering, soldiers, despite, efforts, by, the, british, ambassador, sir, george, buchanan, to, warn, the, tsar, that, he, should, grant, constitutional, reforms, to, fend, off, revolution, nicholas, continued, to, bury, himself, away, at, the, staff, hq, stavka, 600, kilometres, 400, mi,

recently, gained, strength, however, they, were, increasingly, alienated, by, the, tsar, s, support, of, stolypin, s, westernizing, reforms, taken, early, in, the, revolution, of, 1905, and,

including, delight, relief, fear, anger, and, confusion, both, the, provisional, government, and, nicholas, wanted, the, royal, family, to, go, into, exile, following, his, abdication, with, the, united, kingdom, being, the, preferred, option, the, british, government, reluctantly, offered, the, family, asylum, on, 19, march, 1917, although, it, was, suggested, that, it, would, be, better, for, the, romanovs, to, go, to, a, neutral, country, news, of, the, offer, provoked, uproar, from, the, labour, party, and, many, liberals, and, the, british, ambassador, sir, george, buchanan, advised, the, government, that, the, extreme, left, would, use, the, ex, tsar, s, presence, as, an, excuse, for, rousing, public, opinion, against, us, the, liberal, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, preferred, that, the, family, went, to, a, neutral, country, and, wanted, the, offer, to, be, announced, as, at, the, request, of, the, russian, government, the, offer, of, asylum, was, withdrawn, in, april, following, objections, by, king, george, v, who, acting, on, the, advice, of, his, secretary, lord, stamfordham, was, worried, that, nicholas, s, presence, might, provoke, an, uprising, like, the, previous, year, s, easter, rising, in, ireland, however, later, the, king, defied, his, secretary, and, went, to, the, romanov, memorial, service, at, the, russian, church, in, london, in, the, early, summer, of, 1917, the, russian, government, approached, the, british, government, on, the, issue, of, asylum, and, was, informed, the, offer, had, been, withdrawn, due, to, the, considerations, of, british, internal, politics, the, french, government, declined, to, accept, the, romanovs, in, view, of, increasing, unrest, on, the, western, front, and, on, the, home, front, as, a, result, of, the, ongoing, war, with, germany, the, british, ambassador, in, paris, lord, bertie, advised, the, foreign, secretary, that, the, romanovs, would, be, unwelcome, in, france, as, the, ex, empress, was, regarded, as, pro, german, even, if, an, offer, of, asylum, had, been, forthcoming, there, would, have, been, other, obstacles, to, be, overcome, the, provisional, government, only, remained, in, power, through, an, uneasy, alliance, with, the, petrograd, soviet, an, arrangement, known, as, the, dual, power, an, initial, plan, to, send, the, imperial, family, to, the, northern, port, of, murmansk, had, to, be, abandoned, when, it, was, realised, that, the, railway, workers, and, the, soldiers, guarding, them, were, loyal, to, the, petrograd, soviet, which, opposed, the, escape, of, the, tsar, a, later, proposal, to, send, the, romanovs, to, a, neutral, port, in, the, baltic, sea, via, the, grand, duchy, of, finland, faced, similar, difficulties, on, 20, march, 1917, the, provisional, government, decreed, that, the, imperial, family, should, be, held, under, house, arrest, in, the, alexander, palace, at, tsarskoye, selo, nicholas, joined, the, rest, of, the, family, there, two, days, later, having, traveled, from, the, wartime, headquarters, at, mogilev, the, family, had, total, privacy, inside, the, palace, but, walks, in, the, grounds, were, strictly, regulated, members, of, their, domestic, staff, were, allowed, to, stay, if, they, wished, and, culinary, standards, were, maintained, colonel, eugene, kobylinsky, was, appointed, to, command, the, military, garrison, at, tsarskoye, selo, which, increasingly, had, to, be, done, through, negotiation, with, the, committees, or, soviets, elected, by, the, soldiers, during, his, imprisonment, nicholas, read, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, to, his, family, that, summer, the, failure, of, the, kerensky, offensive, against, austro, hungarian, and, german, forces, in, galicia, led, to, anti, government, rioting, in, petrograd, known, as, the, july, days, the, government, feared, that, further, disturbances, in, the, city, could, easily, reach, tsarskoye, selo, and, it, was, decided, to, move, the, imperial, family, to, a, safer, location, alexander, kerensky, who, had, taken, over, as, prime, minister, selected, the, town, of, tobolsk, in, western, siberia, since, it, was, remote, from, any, large, city, and, 150, miles, 240, km, from, the, nearest, rail, station, some, sources, state, that, there, was, an, intention, to, send, the, family, abroad, in, the, spring, of, 1918, via, japan, but, more, recent, work, suggests, that, this, was, just, a, bolshevik, rumour, the, family, left, the, alexander, palace, late, on, 13, august, reached, tyumen, by, rail, four, days, later, and, then, by, two, river, ferries, finally, reached, tobolsk, on, 19, august, there, they, lived, in, the, former, governor, s, mansion, in, considerable, comfort, in, october, 1917, however, the, bolsheviks, seized, power, from, kerensky, s, provisional, government, nicholas, followed, the, events, in, october, with, interest, but, not, yet, with, alarm, boris, soloviev, the, husband, of, maria, rasputin, attempted, to, organize, a, rescue, with, monarchical, factions, but, it, came, to, nothing, rumors, persist, that, soloviev, was, working, for, the, bolsheviks, or, the, germans, or, both, separate, preparations, for, a, rescue, by, nikolai, yevgenyevich, markov, were, frustrated, by, soloviev, s, ineffectual, activities, nicholas, continued, to, underestimate, lenin, s, importance, in, the, meantime, he, and, his, family, occupied, themselves, with, reading, books, exercising, and, playing, games, nicholas, particularly, enjoyed, chopping, firewood, however, in, january, 1918, the, guard, detachment, s, committee, grew, more, assertive, restricting, the, hours, that, the, family, could, spend, in, the, grounds, and, banning, them, from, walking, to, church, on, a, sunday, as, they, had, done, since, october, in, a, later, incident, the, soldiers, tore, the, epaulettes, from, kobylinsky, s, uniform, and, he, asked, nicholas, not, to, wear, his, uniform, outside, for, fear, of, provoking, a, similar, event, in, february, 1918, the, council, of, people, s, commissars, abbreviated, to, sovnarkom, in, moscow, the, new, capital, announced, that, the, state, subsidy, for, the, family, would, be, drastically, reduced, starting, on, 1, march, this, meant, parting, with, twelve, devoted, servants, and, giving, up, butter, and, coffee, as, luxuries, even, though, nicholas, added, to, the, funds, from, his, own, resources, nicholas, and, alexandra, were, appalled, by, news, of, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, whereby, russia, agreed, to, give, up, poland, finland, the, baltic, states, most, of, belarus, ukraine, the, crimea, most, of, the, caucasus, and, small, parts, of, russia, proper, including, areas, around, pskov, and, rostov, on, don, what, kept, the, family, s, spirits, up, was, the, belief, that, help, was, at, hand, the, romanovs, believed, that, various, plots, were, underway, to, break, them, out, of, captivity, and, smuggle, them, to, safety, the, western, allies, lost, interest, in, the, fate, of, the, romanovs, after, russia, left, the, war, the, german, government, wanted, the, monarchy, restored, in, russia, to, crush, the, bolsheviks, and, maintain, good, relations, with, the, central, powers, the, situation, in, tobolsk, changed, for, the, worse, on, 26, march, when, 250, ill, disciplined, red, guards, arrived, from, the, regional, capital, omsk, not, to, be, outdone, the, soviet, in, yekaterinburg, the, capital, of, the, neighbouring, ural, region, sent, 400, red, guards, to, exert, their, influence, on, the, town, disturbances, between, these, rival, groups, and, the, lack, of, funds, to, pay, the, guard, detachment, caused, them, to, send, a, delegation, to, moscow, to, plead, their, case, the, result, was, that, sovnarkom, appointed, their, own, commissar, to, take, charge, of, tobolsk, and, remove, the, romanovs, to, yekaterinburg, with, the, intention, of, eventually, bringing, nicholas, to, a, show, trial, in, moscow, the, man, selected, was, vasily, yakovlev, a, veteran, bolshevik, recruiting, a, body, of, loyal, men, en, route, yakovlev, arrived, in, tobolsk, on, 22, april, he, imposed, his, authority, on, the, competing, red, guards, factions, paid, off, and, demobilized, the, guard, detachment, and, placed, further, restrictions, on, the, romanovs, the, next, day, yakovlev, informed, kobylinsky, that, nicholas, was, to, be, transferred, to, yekaterinburg, alexei, was, too, ill, to, travel, so, alexandra, elected, to, go, with, nicholas, along, with, maria, while, the, other, daughters, would, remain, at, tobolsk, until, they, were, able, to, make, the, journey, at, 3, am, on, 25, april, the, three, romanovs, their, retinue, and, the, escort, of, yakovlev, s, detachment, left, tobolsk, in, a, convoy, of, nineteen, tarantasses, four, wheeled, carriages, as, the, river, was, still, partly, frozen, which, prevented, the, use, of, the, ferry, after, an, arduous, journey, which, included, two, overnight, stops, fording, rivers, frequent, changes, of, horses, and, a, foiled, plot, by, the, yekaterinburg, red, guards, to, abduct, and, kill, the, prisoners, the, party, arrived, at, tyumen, and, boarded, a, requisitioned, train, yakovlev, was, able, to, communicate, securely, with, moscow, by, means, of, a, hughes, teleprinter, and, obtained, agreement, to, change, their, destination, to, omsk, where, it, was, thought, that, the, leadership, were, less, likely, to, harm, the, romanovs, leaving, tyumen, early, on, 28, april, the, train, left, towards, yekaterinburg, but, quickly, changed, direction, towards, omsk, this, led, the, yekaterinburg, leaders, to, believe, that, yakovlev, was, a, traitor, who, was, trying, to, take, nicholas, to, exile, by, way, of, vladivostok, telegraph, messages, were, sent, two, thousand, armed, men, were, mobilized, and, a, train, was, dispatched, to, arrest, yakovlev, and, the, romanovs, the, romanovs, train, was, halted, at, omsk, station, and, after, a, frantic, exchange, of, cables, with, moscow, it, was, agreed, that, they, should, go, to, yekaterinburg, in, return, for, a, guarantee, of, safety, for, the, imperial, family, they, finally, arrived, there, on, the, morning, of, 30, april, they, were, imprisoned, in, the, two, story, ipatiev, house, the, home, of, the, military, engineer, nikolay, nikolayevich, ipatiev, which, ominously, became, referred, to, as, the, house, of, special, purpose, here, the, romanovs, were, kept, under, even, stricter, conditions, their, retinue, was, further, reduced, and, their, possessions, were, searched, following, allegations, of, pilfering, from, the, royal, household, yakov, yurovsky, a, former, member, of, the, cheka, secret, police, was, appointed, to, command, the, guard, detachment, a, number, of, whom, were, replaced, with, trusted, latvian, members, of, the, yekaterinburg, special, service, detachment, the, remaining, romanovs, left, tobolsk, by, river, steamer, on, 20, may, and, arrived, in, yekaterinburg, three, days, later, by, the, first, weeks, of, june, the, bolsheviks, were, becoming, alarmed, by, the, revolt, of, the, czechoslovak, legion, whose, forces, were, approaching, the, city, from, the, east, this, prompted, a, wave, of, executions, and, murders, of, those, in, the, region, who, were, believed, to, be, counter, revolutionaries, including, grand, duke, michael, who, was, murdered, in, perm, on, 13, june, although, the, bolshevik, leadership, in, moscow, still, intended, to, bring, nicholas, to, trial, as, the, military, situation, deteriorated, leon, trotsky, and, yakov, sverdlov, began, to, publicly, equivocate, about, the, possible, fate, of, the, former, tsar, on, 16, july, the, yekaterinburg, leadership, informed, yurovsky, that, it, had, been, decided, to, execute, the, romanovs, as, soon, as, approval, arrived, from, moscow, because, the, czechs, were, expected, to, reach, the, city, imminently, a, coded, telegram, arrived, in, moscow, from, yekaterinburg, that, evening, after, lenin, and, sverdlov, had, conferred, a, reply, was, sent,

paul, cathedral, saint, petersburg, on, 17, july, 1998, on, the, eightieth, anniversary, of, their, assassination, the, ceremony, was, attended, by, russian, president, boris, yeltsin, who, said,

the, funeral, by, prince, michael, of, kent, and, more, than, twenty, ambassadors, to, russia, including, sir, andrew, wood, archbishop, john, bukovsky, and, ernst, j, rg, von, studnitz, were, also, in, attendance, in, 1981, nicholas, and, his, immediate, family, were, recognised, as, martyred, saints, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, outside, of, russia, on, 14, august, 2000, they, were, recognised, by, the, synod, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, this, time, they, were, not, named, as, martyrs, since, their, deaths, did, not, result, immediately, from, their, christian, faith, instead, they, were, canonized, as, passion, bearers, according, to, a, statement, by, the, moscow, synod, they, were, glorified, as, saints, for, the, following, reasons, in, the, last, orthodox, russian, monarch, and, members, of, his, family, we, see, people, who, sincerely, strove, to, incarnate, in, their, lives, the, commands, of, the, gospel, in, the, suffering, borne, by, the, royal, family, in, prison, with, humility, patience, and, meekness, and, in, their, martyrs, deaths, in, yekaterinburg, in, the, night, of, 17, july, 1918, was, revealed, the, light, of, the, faith, of, christ, that, conquers, evil, however, nicholas, canonization, was, controversial, the, russian, orthodox, church, abroad, was, split, on, the, issue, back, in, 1981, some, members, suggesting, that, the, emperor, was, a, weak, ruler, and, had, failed, to, thwart, the, rise, of, the, bolsheviks, it, was, pointed, out, by, one, priest, that, martyrdom, in, the, russian, orthodox, church, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, martyr, s, personal, actions, but, is, instead, related, to, why, he, or, she, was, killed, the, russian, orthodox, church, inside, russia, rejected, the, family, s, classification, as, martyrs, because, they, were, not, killed, on, account, of, their, religious, faith, religious, leaders, in, both, churches, also, had, objections, to, canonising, the, tsar, s, family, because, they, perceived, him, as, a, weak, emperor, whose, incompetence, led, to, the, revolution, and, the, suffering, of, his, people, and, made, him, partially, responsible, for, his, own, assassination, and, those, of, his, wife, children, and, servants, for, these, opponents, the, fact, that, the, tsar, was, in, private, life, a, kind, man, and, a, good, husband, and, father, or, a, leader, who, showed, genuine, concern, for, the, peasantry, did, not, override, his, poor, governance, of, russia, despite, the, original, opposition, the, russian, orthodox, church, inside, russia, ultimately, recognised, the, family, as, passion, bearers, or, people, who, met, their, deaths, with, christian, humility, since, the, late, 20th, century, believers, have, attributed, healing, from, illnesses, or, conversion, to, the, orthodox, church, to, their, prayers, to, the, children, of, nicholas, maria, and, alexei, as, well, as, to, the, rest, of, the, family, contemporary, evaluations, of, nicholas, portrayed, him, as, a, well, meaning, but, indecisive, leader, whose, actions, as, monarch, were, heavily, influenced, by, his, advisors, historian, raymond, esthus, states, the, contemporary, assessments, of, nicholas, are, remarkably, uniform, he, was, described, as, shy, charming, gentle, in, disposition, fearful, of, controversy, indecisive, indulgent, to, his, relatives, and, deeply, devoted, to, his, family, aleksandr, mosolov, who, headed, his, court, chancellery, for, sixteen, years, wrote, that, nicholas, though, intelligent, and, well, educated, never, adopted, a, definite, energetic, attitude, and, loathed, making, a, decision, in, the, presence, of, others, sergei, witte, who, served, nicholas, and, his, father, for, eleven, years, as, minister, of, finance, commented, that, the, tsar, was, a, well, intentioned, child, but, his, actions, were, entirely, dependent, upon, the, character, of, his, counselors, most, of, whom, were, bad, during, the, soviet, period, nicholas, ii, s, legacy, was, widely, criticised, within, russia, although, discussion, was, heavily, influenced, by, state, propaganda, which, described, him, as, a, bloodthirsty, tyrant, pavel, bykov, who, wrote, the, first, full, account, of, the, downfall, of, the, tsar, for, the, new, soviet, government, denounced, nicholas, as, a, tyrant, who, paid, with, his, life, for, the, age, old, repression, and, arbitrary, rule, of, his, ancestors, over, the, russian, people, over, the, impoverished, and, blood, soaked, country, soviet, era, historians, described, nicholas, ii, as, unfit, for, rule, arguing, that, he, had, a, weak, will, and, was, manipulated, by, adventurist, forces, he, was, also, criticised, for, fanning, nationalism, and, chauvinism, and, his, regime, was, condemned, for, its, extensive, use, of, the, army, police, and, courts, to, destroy, the, revolutionary, movement, during, his, reign, nicholas, had, become, known, as, nicholas, the, bloody, for, his, role, in, the, khodynka, tragedy, and, the, suppression, of, the, 1905, revolution, the, majority, view, among, historians, is, that, nicholas, was, a, well, intentioned, yet, poor, ruler, who, proved, incapable, of, handling, the, challenges, facing, his, nation, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, nicholas, was, generally, considered, by, historians, to, have, been, incompetent, at, the, colossal, task, of, ruling, the, enormous, russian, empire, although, the, influence, of, soviet, propaganda, on, general, opinion, must, be, considered, barbara, tuchman, provides, a, damning,
