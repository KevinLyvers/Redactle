jacob, bernoulli, also, known, as, james, in, english, or, jacques, in, french, 6, january, 1655, 16, august, 1705, was, one, of, the, many, prominent, mathematicians, in, the, swiss, bernoulli, family, he, sided, with, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, during, the, leibniz, newton, calculus, controversy, and, was, an, early, proponent, of, leibnizian, calculus, which, he, made, numerous, contributions, to, along, with, his, brother, johann, he, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, calculus, of, variations, he, also, discovered, the, fundamental, mathematical, constant, e, however, his, most, important, contribution, was, in, the, field, of, probability, where, he, derived, the, first, version, of, the, law, of, large, numbers, in, his, work, ars, conjectandi, jacob, bernoulli, was, born, in, basel, in, the, old, swiss, confederacy, following, his, father, s, wish, he, studied, theology, and, entered, the, ministry, but, contrary, to, the, desires, of, his, parents, he, also, studied, mathematics, and, astronomy, he, traveled, throughout, europe, from, 1676, to, 1682, learning, about, the, latest, discoveries, in, mathematics, and, the, sciences, under, leading, figures, of, the, time, this, included, the, work, of, johannes, hudde, robert, boyle, and, robert, hooke, during, this, time, he, also, produced, an, incorrect, theory, of, comets, bernoulli, returned, to, switzerland, and, began, teaching, mechanics, at, the, university, of, basel, from, 1683, his, doctoral, dissertation, solutionem, tergemini, problematis, was, submitted, in, 1684, it, appeared, in, print, in, 1687, in, 1684, bernoulli, married, judith, stupanus, they, had, two, children, during, this, decade, he, also, began, a, fertile, research, career, his, travels, allowed, him, to, establish, correspondence, with, many, leading, mathematicians, and, scientists, of, his, era, which, he, maintained, throughout, his, life, during, this, time, he, studied, the, new, discoveries, in, mathematics, including, christiaan, huygens, s, de, ratiociniis, in, aleae, ludo, descartes, la, g, om, trie, and, frans, van, schooten, s, supplements, of, it, he, also, studied, isaac, barrow, and, john, wallis, leading, to, his, interest, in, infinitesimal, geometry, apart, from, these, it, was, between, 1684, and, 1689, that, many, of, the, results, that, were, to, make, up, ars, conjectandi, were, discovered, he, was, appointed, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, basel, in, 1687, remaining, in, this, position, for, the, rest, of, his, life, by, that, time, he, had, begun, tutoring, his, brother, johann, bernoulli, on, mathematical, topics, the, two, brothers, began, to, study, the, calculus, as, presented, by, leibniz, in, his, 1684, paper, on, the, differential, calculus, in, nova, methodus, pro, maximis, et, minimis, published, in, acta, eruditorum, they, also, studied, the, publications, of, von, tschirnhaus, it, must, be, understood, that, leibniz, s, publications, on, the, calculus, were, very, obscure, to, mathematicians, of, that, time, and, the, bernoullis, were, among, the, first, to, try, to, understand, and, apply, leibniz, s, theories, jacob, collaborated, with, his, brother, on, various, applications, of, calculus, however, the, atmosphere, of, collaboration, between, the, two, brothers, turned, into, rivalry, as, johann, s, own, mathematical, genius, began, to, mature, with, both, of, them, attacking, each, other, in, print, and, posing, difficult, mathematical, challenges, to, test, each, other, s, skills, by, 1697, the, relationship, had, completely, broken, down, the, lunar, crater, bernoulli, is, also, named, after, him, jointly, with, his, brother, johann, jacob, bernoulli, s, first, important, contributions, were, a, pamphlet, on, the, parallels, of, logic, and, algebra, published, in, 1685, work, on, probability, in, 1685, and, geometry, in, 1687, his, geometry, result, gave, a, construction, to, divide, any, triangle, into, four, equal, parts, with, two, perpendicular, lines, by, 1689, he, had, published, important, work, on, infinite, series, and, published, his, law, of, large, numbers, in, probability, theory, jacob, bernoulli, published, five, treatises, on, infinite, series, between, 1682, and, 1704, the, first, two, of, these, contained, many, results, such, as, the, fundamental, result, that, 1, n, displaystyle, sum, frac, 1, n, diverges, which, bernoulli, believed, were, new, but, they, had, actually, been, proved, by, pietro, mengoli, 40, years, earlier, and, was, proved, by, nicole, oresme, in, the, 14th, century, already, bernoulli, could, not, find, a, closed, form, for, 1, n, 2, displaystyle, sum, frac, 1, n, 2, but, he, did, show, that, it, converged, to, a, finite, limit, less, than, 2, euler, was, the, first, to, find, the, limit, of, this, series, in, 1737, bernoulli, also, studied, the, exponential, series, which, came, out, of, examining, compound, interest, in, may, 1690, in, a, paper, published, in, acta, eruditorum, jacob, bernoulli, showed, that, the, problem, of, determining, the, isochrone, is, equivalent, to, solving, a, first, order, nonlinear, differential, equation, the, isochrone, or, curve, of, constant, descent, is, the, curve, along, which, a, particle, will, descend, under, gravity, from, any, point, to, the, bottom, in, exactly, the, same, time, no, matter, what, the, starting, point, it, had, been, studied, by, huygens, in, 1687, and, leibniz, in, 1689, after, finding, the, differential, equation, bernoulli, then, solved, it, by, what, we, now, call, separation, of, variables, jacob, bernoulli, s, paper, of, 1690, is, important, for, the, history, of, calculus, since, the, term, integral, appears, for, the, first, time, with, its, integration, meaning, in, 1696, bernoulli, solved, the, equation, now, called, the, bernoulli, differential, equation, jacob, bernoulli, also, discovered, a, general, method, to, determine, evolutes, of, a, curve, as, the, envelope, of, its, circles, of, curvature, he, also, investigated, caustic, curves, and, in, particular, he, studied, these, associated, curves, of, the, parabola, the, logarithmic, spiral, and, epicycloids, around, 1692, the, lemniscate, of, bernoulli, was, first, conceived, by, jacob, bernoulli, in, 1694, in, 1695, he, investigated, the, drawbridge, problem, which, seeks, the, curve, required, so, that, a, weight, sliding, along, the, cable, always, keeps, the, drawbridge, balanced, bernoulli, s, most, original, work, was, ars, conjectandi, published, in, basel, in, 1713, eight, years, after, his, death, the, work, was, incomplete, at, the, time, of, his, death, but, it, is, still, a, work, of, the, greatest, significance, in, the, theory, of, probability, the, book, also, covers, other, related, subjects, including, a, review, of, combinatorics, in, particular, the, work, of, van, schooten, leibniz, and, prestet, as, well, as, the, use, of, bernoulli, numbers, in, a, discussion, of, the, exponential, series, inspired, by, huygens, work, bernoulli, also, gives, many, examples, on, how, much, one, would, expect, to, win, playing, various, games, of, chance, the, term, bernoulli, trial, resulted, from, this, work, in, the, last, part, of, the, book, bernoulli, sketches, many, areas, of, mathematical, probability, including, probability, as, a, measurable, degree, of, certainty, necessity, and, chance, moral, versus, mathematical, expectation, a, priori, an, a, posteriori, probability, expectation, of, winning, when, players, are, divided, according, to, dexterity, regard, of, all, available, arguments, their, valuation, and, their, calculable, evaluation, and, the, law, of, large, numbers, bernoulli, was, one, of, the, most, significant, promoters, of, the, formal, methods, of, higher, analysis, astuteness, and, elegance, are, seldom, found, in, his, method, of, presentation, and, expression, but, there, is, a, maximum, of, integrity, in, 1683, bernoulli, discovered, the, constant, e, by, studying, a, question, about, compound, interest, which, required, him, to, find, the, value, of, the, following, expression, which, is, in, fact, e, one, example, is, an, account, that, starts, with, 1, 00, and, pays, 100, percent, interest, per, year, if, the, interest, is, credited, once, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, value, is, 2, 00, but, if, the, interest, is, computed, and, added, twice, in, the, year, the, 1, is, multiplied, by, 1, 5, twice, yielding, 1, 00, 1, 5, 2, 2, 25, compounding, quarterly, yields, 1, 00, 1, 25, 4, 2, 4414, and, compounding, monthly, yields, 1, 00, 1, 0833, 12, 2, 613035, bernoulli, noticed, that, this, sequence, approaches, a, limit, the, force, of, interest, for, more, and, smaller, compounding, intervals, compounding, weekly, yields, 2, 692597, while, compounding, daily, yields, 2, 714567, just, two, cents, more, using, n, as, the, number, of, compounding, intervals, with, interest, of, 100, n, in, each, interval, the, limit, for, large, n, is, the, number, that, euler, later, named, e, with, continuous, compounding, the, account, value, will, reach, 2, 7182818, more, generally, an, account, that, starts, at, 1, and, yields, 1, r, dollars, at, compound, interest, will, yield, e, r, dollars, with, continuous, compounding, bernoulli, wanted, a, logarithmic, spiral, and, the, motto, eadem, mutata, resurgo, although, changed, i, rise, again, the, same, engraved, on, his, tombstone, he, wrote, that, the, self, similar, spiral, may, be, used, as, a, symbol, either, of, fortitude, and, constancy, in, adversity, or, of, the, human, body, which, after, all, its, changes, even, after, death, will, be, restored, to, its, exact, and, perfect, self, bernoulli, died, in, 1705, but, an, archimedean, spiral, was, engraved, rather, than, a, logarithmic, one, translation, of, latin, inscription
