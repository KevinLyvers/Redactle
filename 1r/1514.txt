baden, from, the, age, of, ten, eugene, had, been, brought, up, for, a, career, in, the, church, since, he, was, the, youngest, of, his, family, eugene, s, appearance, was, not, impressive, he, was, never, good, looking, wrote, the, duchess, of, orl, ans, it, is, true, that, his, eyes, are, not, ugly, but, his, nose, ruins, his, face, he, has, two, large, teeth, which, are, visible, at, all, times, according, to, the, duchess, who, was, married, to, louis, xiv, s, bisexual, brother, the, duke, of, orl, ans, eugene, lived, a, life, of, debauchery, and, belonged, to, a, small, effeminate, set, that, included, the, famous, cross, dresser, abb, fran, ois, timol, on, de, choisy, in, february, 1683, to, the, surprise, of, his, family, the, 19, year, old, eugene, declared, his, intention, of, joining, the, army, eugene, applied, directly, to, louis, xiv, for, command, of, a, company, in, french, service, but, the, king, who, was, said, to, dislike, eugene, s, appearance, and, who, had, shown, no, compassion, for, olympia, s, children, since, her, disgrace, refused, him, out, of, hand, the, request, was, modest, not, so, the, petitioner, he, remarked, no, one, else, ever, presumed, to, stare, me, out, so, insolently, whatever, the, case, louis, xiv, s, choice, would, cost, him, dearly, twenty, years, later, for, it, would, be, precisely, eugene, in, collaboration, with, the, duke, of, marlborough, who, would, defeat, the, french, army, at, blenheim, a, decisive, battle, which, checked, french, military, supremacy, and, political, power, denied, a, military, career, in, france, eugene, decided, to, seek, service, abroad, one, of, eugene, s, brothers, louis, julius, had, entered, imperial, service, the, previous, year, but, he, had, been, immediately, killed, fighting, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1683, when, news, of, his, death, reached, paris, eugene, decided, to, travel, to, austria, in, the, hope, of, taking, over, his, brother, s, command, it, was, not, an, unnatural, decision, his, first, cousin, louis, of, baden, was, already, a, leading, general, in, the, imperial, army, as, was, a, more, distant, cousin, maximilian, ii, emanuel, elector, of, bavaria, on, the, night, of, 26, july, 1683, eugene, left, paris, and, headed, east, years, later, in, his, memoirs, eugene, recalled, his, early, years, in, france, some, future, historians, good, or, bad, will, perhaps, take, the, trouble, to, enter, into, the, details, of, my, youth, of, which, i, scarcely, recollect, anything, they, will, certainly, speak, of, my, mother, somewhat, too, intriguing, driven, from, the, court, exiled, from, paris, and, suspected, i, believe, of, sorcery, by, people, who, were, not, themselves, very, great, wizards, they, will, tell, how, i, was, born, in, france, then, left, it, my, heart, swelling, with, enmity, against, louis, xiv, who, refused, me, a, cavalry, company, because, said, he, i, was, of, too, delicate, a, constitution, that, he, refused, me, an, abbey, because, based, on, i, don, t, know, what, ill, talks, about, me, or, what, invented, anecdotes, from, the, gallery, of, versailles, that, i, was, more, shaped, for, pleasure, than, for, piety, there, is, not, a, huguenot, expelled, by, the, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, who, hated, louis, xiv, more, than, i, did, therefore, when, louvois, heard, of, my, departure, saying, so, much, the, better, he, will, never, return, into, this, country, again, i, swore, never, to, enter, it, but, with, arms, in, my, hands, i, have, kept, my, word, by, may, 1683, the, ottoman, threat, to, emperor, leopold, i, s, capital, vienna, was, very, evident, the, grand, vizier, kara, mustafa, pasha, encouraged, by, imre, th, k, ly, s, magyar, rebellion, had, invaded, hungary, with, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, men, within, two, months, approximately, 90, 000, were, beneath, vienna, s, walls, with, the, turks, at, the, gates, the, emperor, fled, for, the, safe, refuge, of, passau, up, the, danube, it, was, at, leopold, i, s, camp, that, eugene, arrived, in, mid, august, although, eugene, was, not, of, austrian, extraction, he, did, have, habsburg, antecedents, his, grandfather, thomas, francis, founder, of, the, carignano, line, of, the, house, of, savoy, was, the, son, of, catherine, michaela, of, spain, a, daughter, of, philip, ii, of, spain, and, the, great, grandson, of, the, emperor, charles, v, but, of, more, immediate, consequence, to, leopold, i, was, the, fact, that, eugene, was, a, relative, of, victor, amadeus, ii, the, duke, of, savoy, a, connection, that, the, emperor, hoped, might, prove, useful, in, any, future, confrontation, with, france, these, ties, together, with, his, ascetic, manner, and, appearance, a, positive, advantage, to, him, at, the, sombre, court, of, leopold, i, ensured, the, refugee, from, the, hated, french, king, a, warm, welcome, at, passau, and, a, position, in, imperial, service, though, french, was, his, favoured, language, he, communicated, with, leopold, in, italian, as, the, emperor, though, he, knew, it, perfectly, disliked, french, but, eugene, also, had, a, reasonable, command, of, german, which, he, understood, very, easily, something, that, helped, him, much, in, the, military, i, will, devote, all, my, strength, all, my, courage, and, if, need, be, my, last, drop, of, blood, to, the, service, of, your, imperial, majesty, eugene, had, no, doubt, as, to, where, his, new, allegiance, lay, and, this, loyalty, was, immediately, put, to, the, test, by, september, the, imperial, forces, under, the, duke, of, lorraine, together, with, a, powerful, polish, army, under, king, john, iii, sobieski, were, poised, to, strike, the, sultan, s, army, on, the, morning, of, 12, september, the, christian, forces, drew, up, in, line, of, battle, on, the, south, eastern, slopes, of, the, vienna, woods, looking, down, on, the, massed, enemy, camp, the, day, long, battle, of, vienna, resulted, in, the, lifting, of, the, 60, day, siege, and, the, sultan, s, forces, were, routed, serving, under, baden, as, a, twenty, year, old, volunteer, eugene, distinguished, himself, in, the, battle, earning, commendation, from, lorraine, and, the, emperor, he, later, received, the, nomination, for, the, colonelcy, and, was, awarded, the, kufstein, regiment, of, dragoons, by, leopold, i, in, march, 1684, leopold, i, formed, the, holy, league, with, poland, and, venice, to, counter, the, ottoman, threat, for, the, next, two, years, eugene, continued, to, perform, with, distinction, on, campaign, and, establish, himself, as, a, dedicated, professional, soldier, by, the, end, of, 1685, still, only, 22, years, old, he, was, made, a, major, general, little, is, known, of, eugene, s, life, during, these, early, campaigns, contemporary, observers, make, only, passing, comments, of, his, actions, and, his, own, surviving, correspondence, largely, to, his, cousin, victor, amadeus, are, typically, reticent, about, his, own, feelings, and, experiences, nevertheless, it, is, clear, that, baden, was, impressed, with, eugene, s, qualities, this, young, man, will, with, time, occupy, the, place, of, those, whom, the, world, regards, as, great, leaders, of, armies, in, june, 1686, the, duke, of, lorraine, besieged, buda, budapest, the, centre, of, ottoman, hungary, and, the, old, royal, capital, after, resisting, for, 78, days, the, city, fell, on, 2, september, and, turkish, resistance, collapsed, throughout, the, region, as, far, away, as, transylvania, and, serbia, further, success, followed, in, 1687, where, commanding, a, cavalry, brigade, eugene, made, an, important, contribution, to, the, victory, at, the, battle, of, moh, cs, on, 12, august, such, was, the, scale, of, their, defeat, that, the, ottoman, army, mutinied, a, revolt, which, spread, to, constantinople, the, grand, vizier, sar, s, leyman, pasha, was, executed, and, sultan, mehmed, iv, deposed, once, again, eugene, s, courage, earned, him, recognition, from, his, superiors, who, granted, him, the, honour, of, personally, conveying, the, news, of, victory, to, the, emperor, in, vienna, for, his, services, eugene, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, general, in, november, 1687, he, was, also, gaining, wider, recognition, king, charles, ii, of, spain, bestowed, upon, him, the, order, of, the, golden, fleece, while, his, cousin, victor, amadeus, provided, him, with, money, and, two, profitable, abbeys, in, piedmont, eugene, s, military, career, suffered, a, temporary, setback, in, 1688, when, on, 6, september, the, prince, suffered, a, severe, wound, to, his, knee, by, a, musket, ball, during, the, siege, of, belgrade, and, did, not, return, to, active, service, until, january, 1689, just, as, belgrade, was, falling, to, imperial, forces, under, max, emmanuel, in, the, east, french, troops, in, the, west, were, crossing, the, rhine, into, the, holy, roman, empire, louis, xiv, had, hoped, that, a, show, of, force, would, lead, to, a, quick, resolution, to, his, dynastic, and, territorial, disputes, with, the, princes, of, the, empire, along, his, eastern, border, but, his, intimidatory, moves, only, strengthened, german, resolve, and, in, may, 1689, leopold, i, and, the, dutch, signed, an, offensive, compact, aimed, at, repelling, french, aggression, the, nine, years, war, was, professionally, and, personally, frustrating, for, the, prince, initially, fighting, on, the, rhine, with, max, emmanuel, receiving, a, slight, head, wound, at, the, siege, of, mainz, in, 1689, eugene, subsequently, transferred, himself, to, piedmont, after, victor, amadeus, joined, the, alliance, against, france, in, 1690, promoted, to, general, of, cavalry, he, arrived, in, turin, with, his, friend, the, prince, of, commercy, but, it, proved, an, inauspicious, start, against, eugene, s, advice, amadeus, insisted, on, engaging, the, french, at, staffarda, and, suffered, a, serious, defeat, only, eugene, s, handling, of, the, savoyard, cavalry, in, retreat, saved, his, cousin, from, disaster, eugene, remained, unimpressed, with, the, men, and, their, commanders, throughout, the, war, in, italy, the, enemy, would, long, ago, have, been, beaten, he, wrote, to, vienna, if, everyone, had, done, their, duty, so, contemptuous, was, he, of, the, imperial, commander, count, carafa, he, threatened, to, leave, imperial, service, in, vienna, eugene, s, attitude, was, dismissed, as, the, arrogance, of, a, young, upstart, but, so, impressed, was, the, emperor, by, his, passion, for, the, imperial, cause, he, promoted, him, to, field, marshal, in, 1693, when, carafa, s, replacement, count, caprara, was, himself, transferred, in, 1694, it, seemed, that, eugene, s, chance, for, command, and, decisive, action, had, finally, arrived, but, amadeus, doubtful, of, victory, and, now, more, fearful, of, habsburg, influence, in, italy, than, he, was, of, french, had, begun, secret, dealings, with, louis, xiv, aimed, at, extricating, himself, from, the, war, by, 1696, the, deal, was, done, and, amadeus, transferred, his, troops, and, his, loyalty, to, the, enemy, eugene, was, never, to, fully, trust, his, cousin, again, although, he, continued, to, pay, due, reverence, to, the, duke, as, head, of, his, family, their, relationship, would, forever, after, remain, strained, military, honours, in, italy, undoubtedly, belonged, to, the, french, commander, marshal, catinat, but, eugene, the, one, allied, general, determined, on, action, and, decisive, results, did, well, to, emerge, from, the, nine, years, war, with, an, enhanced, reputation, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, ryswick, in, september, october, 1697, the, desultory, war, in, the, west, was, finally, brought, to, an, inconclusive, end, and, leopold, i, could, once, again, devote, all, his, martial, energies, into, defeating, the, ottoman, turks, in, the, east, the, distractions, of, the, war, against, louis, xiv, had, enabled, the, turks, to, recapture, belgrade, in, 1690, in, august, 1691, the, austrians, under, louis, of, baden, regained, the, advantage, by, heavily, defeating, the, turks, at, the, battle, of, slankamen, on, the, danube, securing, habsburg, possession, of, hungary, and, transylvania, when, baden, was, transferred, west, to, fight, the, french, in, 1692, his, successors, first, caprara, then, from, 1696, augustus, the, strong, the, elector, of, saxony, proved, incapable, of, delivering, the, final, blow, on, the, advice, of, the, president, of, the, imperial, war, council, ernst, r, diger, von, starhemberg, thirty, four, year, old, eugene, was, offered, supreme, command, of, imperial, forces, in, april, 1697, this, was, eugene, s, first, truly, independent, command, no, longer, need, he, suffer, under, the, excessively, cautious, generalship, of, caprara, and, carafa, or, be, thwarted, by, the, deviations, of, victor, amadeus, but, on, joining, his, army, he, found, it, in, a, state, of, indescribable, misery, confident, and, self, assured, the, prince, of, savoy, ably, assisted, by, commercy, and, guido, starhemberg, set, about, restoring, order, and, discipline, leopold, i, had, warned, eugene, that, he, should, act, with, extreme, caution, forgo, all, risks, and, avoid, engaging, the, enemy, unless, he, has, overwhelming, strength, and, is, practically, certain, of, being, completely, victorious, but, when, the, imperial, commander, learnt, of, sultan, mustafa, ii, s, march, on, transylvania, eugene, abandoned, all, ideas, of, a, defensive, campaign, and, moved, to, intercept, the, turks, as, they, crossed, the, river, tisza, at, zenta, on, 11, september, 1697, it, was, late, in, the, day, before, the, imperial, army, struck, the, ottoman, cavalry, had, already, crossed, the, river, so, eugene, decided, to, attack, immediately, arranging, his, men, in, a, half, moon, formation, the, vigour, of, the, assault, wrought, terror, and, confusion, among, the, turks, and, by, nightfall, the, battle, was, won, for, the, loss, of, some, 2, 000, dead, and, wounded, eugene, had, inflicted, an, overwhelming, defeat, upon, the, enemy, with, approximately, 25, 000, turks, killed, including, the, grand, vizier, elmas, mehmed, pasha, the, pashas, of, adana, anatolia, and, bosnia, plus, more, than, thirty, aghas, of, the, janissaries, sipahis, and, silihdars, as, well, as, seven, horsetails, symbols, of, high, authority, 100, pieces, of, heavy, artillery, 423, banners, and, the, revered, seal, which, the, sultan, always, entrusted, to, the, grand, vizier, on, an, important, campaign, eugene, had, annihilated, the, ottoman, army, and, brought, to, an, end, the, war, of, the, holy, league, although, the, ottomans, lacked, western, organization, and, training, the, savoyard, prince, had, revealed, his, tactical, skill, his, capacity, for, bold, decision, and, his, ability, to, inspire, his, men, to, excel, in, battle, against, a, dangerous, foe, after, a, brief, terror, raid, into, ottoman, bosnia, culminating, in, the, sack, of, sarajevo, eugene, returned, to, vienna, in, november, to, a, triumphal, reception, his, victory, at, zenta, had, turned, him, into, a, european, hero, and, with, victory, came, reward, land, in, hungary, given, him, by, the, emperor, yielded, a, good, income, enabling, the, prince, to, cultivate, his, newly, acquired, tastes, in, art, and, architecture, see, below, but, for, all, his, new, found, wealth, and, property, he, was, nevertheless, without, personal, ties, or, family, commitments, of, his, four, brothers, only, one, was, still, alive, at, this, time, his, fourth, brother, emmanuel, had, died, aged, 14, in, 1676, his, third, louis, julius, already, mentioned, had, died, on, active, service, in, 1683, and, his, second, brother, philippe, died, of, smallpox, in, 1693, eugene, s, remaining, brother, louis, thomas, ostracized, for, incurring, the, displeasure, of, louis, xiv, travelled, europe, in, search, of, a, career, before, arriving, in, vienna, in, 1699, with, eugene, s, help, louis, found, employment, in, the, imperial, army, only, to, be, killed, in, action, against, the, french, in, 1702, of, eugene, s, sisters, the, youngest, had, died, in, childhood, the, other, two, marie, jeanne,

unhappily, until, her, premature, death, in, 1705, of, louise, little, is, known, after, her, early, salacious, life, in, paris, but, in, due, course, she, lived, for, a, time, in, a, convent, in, savoy, before, her, death, in, 1726, the, battle, of, zenta, proved, to, be, the, decisive, victory, in, the, long, war, against, the, turks, with, leopold, i, s, interests, now, focused, on, spain, and, the, imminent, death, of, charles, ii, the, emperor, terminated, the, conflict, with, the, sultan, he, signed, the, treaty, of, karlowitz, on, 26, january, 1699, with, the, death, of, the,

from, vienna, remained, unheeded, forcing, eugene, to, seek, battle, and, gain, a, lucky, hit, the, resulting, battle, of, luzzara, on, 15, august, proved, inconclusive, although, eugene, s, forces, inflicted, double, the, number, of, casualties, on, the, french, the, battle, settled, little, except, to, deter, vend, me, trying, an, all, out, assault, on, imperial, forces, that, year, enabling, eugene, to, hold, on, south, of, the, alps, with, his, army, routing, away, and, personally, grieving, for, his, long, standing, friend, prince, commercy, who, had, died, at, luzzara, eugene, returned, to, vienna, in, january, 1703, eugene, s, european, reputation, was, growing, cremona, and, luzzara, had, been, celebrated, as, victories, throughout, the, allied, capitals, yet, because, of, the, condition, and, morale, of, his, troops, the, 1702, campaign, had, not, been, a, success, austria, itself, was, now, facing, the, direct, threat, of, invasion, from, across, the, border, in, bavaria, where, the, state, s, elector, maximilian, emanuel, had, declared, for, the, bourbons, in, august, the, previous, year, meanwhile, in, hungary, a, small, scale, revolt, had, broken, out, in, may, and, was, fast, gaining, momentum, with, the, monarchy, at, the, point, of, complete, financial, breakdown, leopold, i, was, at, last, persuaded, to, change, the, government, at, the, end, of, june, 1703, gundaker, starhemberg, replaced, gotthard, salaburg, as, president, of, the, treasury, and, prince, eugene, succeeded, henry, mansfeld, as, the, new, president, of, the, imperial, war, council, hofkriegsratspr, sident, as, head, of, the, war, council, eugene, was, now, part, of, the, emperor, s, inner, circle, and, the, first, president, since, raimondo, montecuccoli, to, remain, an, active, commander, immediate, steps, were, taken, to, improve, efficiency, within, the, army, encouragement, and, where, possible, money, was, sent, to, the, commanders, in, the, field, promotion, and, honours, were, distributed, according, to, service, rather, than, influence, and, discipline, improved, but, the, austrian, monarchy, faced, severe, peril, on, several, fronts, in, 1703, by, june, the, duke, of, villars, had, reinforced, the, elector, of, bavaria, on, the, danube, thus, posing, a, direct, threat, to, vienna, while, vend, me, remained, at, the, head, of, a, large, army, in, northern, italy, opposing, guido, starhemberg, s, weak, imperial, force, of, equal, alarm, was, francis, ii, r, k, czi, s, revolt, which, by, the, end, of, the, year, had, reached, as, far, as, moravia, and, lower, austria, dissension, between, villars, and, the, elector, of, bavaria, had, prevented, an, assault, on, vienna, in, 1703, but, in, the, courts, of, versailles, and, madrid, ministers, confidently, anticipated, the, city, s, fall, the, imperial, ambassador, in, london, count, wratislaw, had, pressed, for, anglo, dutch, assistance, on, the, danube, as, early, as, february, 1703, but, the, crisis, in, southern, europe, seemed, remote, from, the, court, of, st, james, s, where, colonial, and, commercial, considerations, were, more, to, the, fore, of, men, s, minds, only, a, handful, of, statesmen, in, england, or, the, dutch, republic, realized, the, true, implications, of, austria, s, peril, foremost, among, these, was, the, english, captain, general, the, duke, of, marlborough, by, early, 1704, marlborough, had, resolved, to, march, south, and, rescue, the, situation, in, southern, germany, and, on, the, danube, personally, requesting, the, presence, of, eugene, on, campaign, so, as, to, have, a, supporter, of, his, zeal, and, experience, the, allied, commanders, met, for, the, first, time, at, the, small, village, of, mundelsheim, on, 10, june, and, immediately, formed, a, close, rapport, the, two, men, becoming, in, the, words, of, thomas, lediard, twin, constellations, in, glory, this, professional, and, personal, bond, ensured, mutual, support, on, the, battlefield, enabling, many, successes, during, the, spanish, succession, war, the, first, of, these, victories, and, the, most, celebrated, came, on, 13, august, 1704, at, the, battle, of, blenheim, eugene, commanded, the, right, wing, of, the, allied, army, holding, the, elector, of, bavaria, s, and, marshal, marsin, s, superior, forces, while, marlborough, broke, through, the, marshal, tallard, s, center, inflicting, over, 30, 000, casualties, the, battle, proved, decisive, vienna, was, saved, and, bavaria, was, knocked, out, of, the, war, both, allied, commanders, were, full, of, praise, for, each, other, s, performance, eugene, s, holding, operation, and, his, pressure, for, action, leading, up, to, the, battle, proved, crucial, for, the, allied, success, in, europe, blenheim, is, regarded, as, much, a, victory, for, eugene, as, it, is, for, marlborough, a, sentiment, echoed, by, sir, winston, churchill, marlborough, s, descendant, and, biographer, who, pays, tribute, to, the, glory, of, prince, eugene, whose, fire, and, spirit, had, exhorted, the, wonderful, exertions, of, his, troops, france, now, faced, the, real, danger, of, invasion, but, leopold, i, in, vienna, was, still, under, severe, strain, r, k, czi, s, revolt, was, a, major, threat, and, guido, starhemberg, and, victor, amadeus, who, had, once, again, switched, loyalties, and, rejoined, the, grand, alliance, in, 1703, had, been, unable, to, halt, the, french, under, vend, me, in, northern, italy, only, amadeus, capital, turin, held, on, eugene, returned, to, italy, in, april, 1705, but, his, attempts, to, move, west, towards, turin, were, thwarted, by, vend, me, s, skilful, manoeuvres, lacking, boats, and, bridging, materials, and, with, desertion, and, sickness, rife, within, his, army, the, outnumbered, imperial, commander, was, helpless, leopold, i, s, assurances, of, money, and, men, had, proved, illusory, but, desperate, appeals, from, amadeus, and, criticism, from, vienna, goaded, the, prince, into, action, resulting, in, the, imperialists, bloody, defeat, at, the, battle, of, cassano, on, 16, august, following, leopold, i, s, death, and, the, accession, of, joseph, i, to, the, imperial, throne, in, may, 1705, eugene, began, to, receive, the, personal, backing, he, desired, joseph, i, proved, to, be, a, strong, supporter, of, eugene, s, supremacy, in, military, affairs, he, was, the, most, effective, emperor, the, prince, served, and, the, one, he, was, happiest, under, promising, support, joseph, i, persuaded, eugene, to, return, to, italy, and, restore, habsburg, honour, the, imperial, commander, arrived, in, theatre, in, mid, april, 1706, just, in, time, to, organize, an, orderly, retreat, of, what, was, left, of, count, reventlow, s, inferior, army, following, his, defeat, by, vend, me, at, the, battle, of, calcinato, on, 19, april, vend, me, now, prepared, to, defend, the, lines, along, the, river, adige, determined, to, keep, eugene, cooped, to, the, east, while, the, marquis, of, la, feuillade, threatened, turin, feigning, attacks, along, the, adige, eugene, descended, south, across, the, river, po, in, mid, july, outmanoeuvring, the, french, commander, and, gaining, a, favourable, position, from, which, he, could, at, last, move, west, towards, piedmont, and, relieve, savoy, s, capital, events, elsewhere, now, had, major, consequences, for, the, war, in, italy, with, villeroi, s, crushing, defeat, by, marlborough, at, the, battle, of, ramillies, on, 23, may, louis, xiv, recalled, vend, me, north, to, take, command, of, french, forces, in, flanders, it, was, a, transfer, that, saint, simon, considered, something, of, a, deliverance, for, the, french, commander, who, was, now, beginning, to, feel, the, unlikelihood, of, success, in, italy, for, prince, eugene, with, the, reinforcements, that, had, joined, him, after, the, battle, of, calcinato, had, entirely, changed, the, outlook, in, that, theatre, of, the, war, the, duke, of, orl, ans, under, the, direction, of, marsin, replaced, vend, me, but, indecision, and, disorder, in, the, french, camp, led, to, their, undoing, after, uniting, his, forces, with, victor, amadeus, at, villastellone, in, early, september, eugene, attacked, overwhelmed, and, decisively, defeated, the, french, forces, besieging, turin, on, 7, september, eugene, s, success, broke, the, french, hold, on, northern, italy, and, the, whole, po, valley, fell, under, allied, control, eugene, had, gained, a, victory, as, signal, as, his, colleague, had, at, ramillies, it, is, impossible, for, me, to, express, the, joy, it, has, given, me, wrote, marlborough, for, i, not, only, esteem, but, i, really, love, the, prince, this, glorious, action, must, bring, france, so, low, that, if, our, friends, could, but, be, persuaded, to, carry, on, the, war, with, vigour, one, year, longer, we, cannot, fail, with, the, blessing, of, god, to, have, such, a, peace, as, will, give, us, quiet, for, all, our, days, the, imperial, victory, in, italy, marked, the, beginning, of, austrian, rule, in, lombardy, and, earned, eugene, the, governorship, of, milan, but, the, following, year, was, to, prove, a, disappointment, for, the, prince, and, the, grand, alliance, as, a, whole, the, emperor, and, eugene, whose, main, goal, after, turin, was, to, take, naples, and, sicily, from, philip, duc, d, anjou, s, supporters, reluctantly, agreed, to, marlborough, s, plan, for, an, attack, on, toulon, the, seat, of, french, naval, power, in, the, mediterranean, disunion, between, the, allied, commanders, victor, amadeus, eugene, and, the, english, admiral, cloudesley, shovell, doomed, the, toulon, enterprise, to, failure, although, eugene, favoured, some, sort, of, attack, on, france, s, south, eastern, border, it, was, clear, he, felt, the, expedition, impractical, and, showed, none, of, the, alacrity, which, he, had, displayed, on, other, occasions, substantial, french, reinforcements, finally, brought, an, end, to, the, venture, and, on, 22, august, 1707, the, imperial, army, began, its, retirement, the, subsequent, capture, of, susa, could, not, compensate, for, the, total, collapse, of, the, toulon, expedition, and, with, it, any, hope, of, an, allied, war, winning, blow, that, year, at, the, beginning, of, 1708, eugene, successfully, evaded, calls, for, him, to, take, charge, in, spain, in, the, end, guido, starhemberg, was, sent, thus, enabling, him, to, take, command, of, the, imperial, army, on, the, moselle, and, once, again, unite, with, marlborough, in, the, spanish, netherlands, eugene, without, his, army, arrived, at, the, allied, camp, at, assche, west, of, brussels, in, early, july, providing, a, welcome, boost, to, morale, after, the, early, defection, of, bruges, and, ghent, to, the, french, our, affairs, improved, through, god, s, support, and, eugene, s, aid, wrote, the, prussian, general, natzmer, whose, timely, arrival, raised, the, spirits, of, the, army, again, and, consoled, us, heartened, by, the, prince, s, confidence, the, allied, commanders, devised, a, bold, plan, to, engage, the, french, army, under, vend, me, and, the, duke, of, burgundy, on, 10, july, the, anglo, dutch, army, made, a, forced, march, to, surprise, the, french, reaching, the, river, scheldt, just, as, the, enemy, was, crossing, to, the, north, the, ensuing, battle, on, 11, july, more, a, contact, action, rather, than, a, set, piece, engagement, ended, in, a, resounding, success, for, the, allies, aided, by, the, dissension, of, the, two, french, commanders, while, marlborough, remained, in, overall, command, eugene, had, led, the, crucial, right, flank, and, centre, once, again, the, allied, commanders, had, co, operated, remarkably, well, prince, eugene, and, i, wrote, the, duke, shall, never, differ, about, our, share, of, the, laurels, marlborough, now, favoured, a, bold, advance, along, the, coast, to, bypass, the, major, french, fortresses, followed, by, a, march, on, paris, but, fearful, of, unprotected, supply, lines, the, dutch, and, eugene, favoured, a, more, cautious, approach, marlborough, acquiesced, and, resolved, upon, the, siege, of, vauban, s, great, fortress, lille, while, the, duke, commanded, the, covering, force, eugene, oversaw, the, siege, of, the, town, which, surrendered, on, 22, october, but, marshal, boufflers, did, not, yield, the, citadel, until, 10, december, yet, for, all, the, difficulties, of, the, siege, eugene, was, badly, wounded, above, his, left, eye, by, a, musket, ball, and, even, survived, an, attempt, to, poison, him, the, campaign, of, 1708, had, been, a, remarkable, success, the, french, were, driven, out, of, almost, all, the, spanish, netherlands, he, who, has, not, seen, this, wrote, eugene, has, seen, nothing, the, recent, defeats, together, with, the, severe, winter, of, 1708, 09, had, caused, extreme, famine, and, privation, in, france, louis, xiv, was, close, to, accepting, allied, terms, but, the, conditions, demanded, by, the, leading, allied, negotiators, anthonie, heinsius, charles, townshend, marlborough, and, eugene, principally, that, louis, xiv, should, use, his, own, troops, to, force, philip, v, off, the, spanish, throne, proved, unacceptable, to, the, french, neither, eugene, nor, marlborough, had, objected, to, the, allied, demands, at, the, time, but, neither, wanted, the, war, with, france, to, continue, and, would, have, preferred, further, talks, to, deal, with, the, spanish, issue, but, the, french, king, offered, no, further, proposals, lamenting, the, collapse, of, the, negotiations, and, aware, of, the, vagaries, of, war, eugene, wrote, to, the, emperor, in, mid, june, 1709, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, the, next, battle, will, be, the, biggest, and, bloodiest, that, has, yet, been, fought, after, the, fall, of, tournai, on, 3, september, itself, a, major, undertaking, the, allied, generals, turned, their, attention, towards, mons, marshal, villars, recently, joined, by, boufflers, moved, his, army, south, west, of, the, town, and, began, to, fortify, his, position, marlborough, and, eugene, favoured, an, engagement, before, villars, could, render, his, position, impregnable, but, they, also, agreed, to, wait, for, reinforcements, from, tournai, which, did, not, arrive, until, the, following, night, thus, giving, the, french, further, opportunity, to, prepare, their, defences, notwithstanding, the, difficulties, of, the, attack, the, allied, generals, did, not, shrink, from, their, original, determination, the, subsequent, battle, of, malplaquet, fought, on, 11, september, 1709, was, the, bloodiest, engagement, of, the, war, on, the, left, flank, the, prince, of, orange, led, his, dutch, infantry, in, desperate, charges, only, to, have, it, cut, to, pieces, on, the, other, flank, eugene, attacked, and, suffered, almost, as, severely, but, sustained, pressure, on, his, extremities, forced, villars, to, weaken, his, centre, thus, enabling, marlborough, to, break, through, and, claim, victory, villars, was, unable, to, save, mons, which, subsequently, capitulated, on, 21, october, but, his, resolute, defence, at, malplaquet, inflicting, up, to, 25, casualties, on, the, allies, may, have, saved, france, from, destruction, in, august, 1709, eugene, s, chief, political, opponent, and, critic, in, vienna, prince, salm, retired, as, court, chamberlain, eugene, and, wratislaw, were, now, the, undisputed, leaders, of, the, austrian, government, all, major, departments, of, state, were, in, their, hands, or, those, of, their, political, allies, another, attempt, at, a, negotiated, settlement, at, geertruidenberg, in, april, 1710, failed, largely, because, the, english, whigs, still, felt, strong, enough, to, refuse, concessions, while, louis, xiv, saw, little, reason, to, accept, what, he, had, refused, the, previous, year, eugene, and, marlborough, could, not, be, accused, of, wrecking, the, negotiations, but, neither, showed, regret, at, the, breakdown, of, the, talks, there, was, no, alternative, but, to, continue, the, war, and, in, june, the, allied, commanders, captured, douai, this, success, was, followed, by, a, series, of, minor, sieges, and, by, the, close, of, 1710, the, allies, had, cleared, much, of, france, s, protective, ring, of, fortresses, yet, there, had, been, no, final, decisive, breakthrough, and, this, was, to, be, the, last, year, that, eugene, and, marlborough, would, work, together, following, the, death, of, joseph, i, on, 17, april, 1711, his, brother, charles, the, pretender, to, the, spanish, throne, became, emperor, in, england, the, new, tory, government, the, peace, party, who, had, deposed, the, whigs, in, october, 1710, declared, their, unwillingness, to, see, charles, vi, become, emperor, as, well, as, king, of, spain, and, had, already, begun, secret, negotiations, with, the, french, in, january, 1712, eugene, arrived, in, england, hoping, to, divert, the, government, away, from, its, peace, policy, but, despite, the, social, success, the, visit, was, a, political, failure, queen, anne, and, her, ministers, remained, determined, to, end, the, war, regardless, of, the, allies, eugene, had, also, arrived, too, late, to, save, marlborough, who, seen, by, the, tories, as, the, main, obstacle, to, peace, had, already, been, dismissed, on, charges, of, embezzlement, elsewhere, the, austrians, had, made, some, progress, the, hungarian, revolt, had, finally, came, to, end, although, eugene, would, have, preferred, to, crush, the, rebels, the, emperor, had, offered, lenient, conditions, leading, to, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, szatm, r, on, 30, april, 1711, hoping, to, influence, public, opinion, in, england, and, force, the, french, into, making, substantial, concessions, eugene, prepared, for, a, major, campaign, but, on, 21, may, 1712, when, the, tories, felt, they, had, secured, favourable, terms, with, their, unilateral, talks, with, the, french, the, duke, of, ormonde, marlborough, s, successor, received, the, so, called, restraining, orders, forbidding, him, to, take, part, in, any, military, action, eugene, took, the, fortress, of, le, quesnoy, in, early, july, before, besieging, landrecies, but, villars, taking, advantage, of, allied, disunity, outmanoeuvred, eugene, and, defeated, the, earl, of, albermarle, s, dutch, garrison, at, the, battle, of, denain, on, 24, july, the, french, followed, the, victory, by, seizing, the, allies, main, supply, magazine, at, marchiennes, before, reversing, their, earlier, losses, at, douai, le, quesnoy, and, bouchain, in, one, summer, the, whole, forward, allied, position, laboriously, built, up, over, the, years, to, act, as, the, springboard, into, france, had, been, precipitously, abandoned, with, the, death, in, december, of, his, friend, and, close, political, ally, count, wratislaw, eugene, became, undisputed, first, minister, in, vienna, his, position, was, built, on, his, military, successes, but, his, actual, power, was, expressed, through, his, role, as, president, of, the, war, council, and, as, de, facto, president, of, the, conference, which, dealt, with, foreign, policy, in, this, position, of, influence, eugene, took, the, lead, in, pressing, charles, vi, towards, peace, the, government, had, come, to, accept, that, further, war, in, the, netherlands, or, spain, was, impossible, without, the, aid, of, the, maritime, powers, yet, the, emperor, still, hoping, that, somehow, he, could, place, himself, on, the, throne, in, spain, refused, to, make, peace, at, the, utrecht, conference, along, with, the, other, allies, reluctantly, eugene, prepared, for, another, campaign, but, lacking, troops, finance, and, supplies, his, prospects, in, 1713, were, poor, villars, with, superior, numbers, was, able, to, keep, eugene, guessing, as, to, his, true, intent, through, successful, feints, and, stratagems, landau, fell, to, the, french, commander, in, august, followed, in, november, by, freiburg, eugene, was, reluctant, to, carry, on, the, war, and, wrote, to, the, emperor, in, june, that, a, bad, peace, would, be, better, than, being, ruined, equally, by, friend, and, foe, with, austrian, finances, exhausted, and, the, german, states, reluctant, to, continue, the, war, charles, vi, was, compelled, to, enter, into, negotiations, eugene, and, villars, who, had, been, old, friends, since, the, turkish, campaigns, of, the, 1680s, initiated, talks, on, 26, november, eugene, proved, an, astute, and, determined, negotiator, and, gained, favourable, terms, by, the, treaty, of, rastatt, signed, on, 7, march, 1714, and, the, treaty, of, baden, signed, on, 7, september, 1714, despite, the, failed, campaign, in, 1713, the, prince, was, able, to, declare, that, in, spite, of, the, military, superiority, of, our, enemies, and, the, defection, of, our, allies, the, conditions, of, peace, will, be, more, advantageous, and, more, glorious, than, those, we, would, have, obtained, at, utrecht, eugene, s, main, reason, for, desiring, peace, in, the, west, was, the, growing, danger, posed, by, the, turks, in, the, east, turkish, military, ambitions, had, revived, after, 1711, when, they, had, mauled, peter, the, great, s, army, on, the, river, pruth, pruth, river, campaign, in, december, 1714, sultan, ahmed, iii, s, forces, attacked, the, venetians, in, the, kingdom, of, the, morea, to, vienna, it, was, clear, that, the, turks, intended, to, attack, hungary, and, undo, the, whole, karlowitz, settlement, of, 1699, after, the, sublime, porte, rejected, an, offer, of, mediation, in, april, 1716, charles, vi, despatched, eugene, to, hungary, to, lead, his, relatively, small, but, professional, army, of, all, eugene, s, wars, this, was, the, one, in, which, he, exercised, most, direct, control, it, was, also, a, war, which, for, the, most, part, austria, fought, and, won, on, her, own, eugene, left, vienna, in, early, june, 1716, with, a, field, army, of, between, 80, 000, and, 90, 000, men, by, early, august, 1716, the, ottoman, turks, some, 200, 000, men, under, the, sultan, s, son, in, law, the, grand, vizier, damat, ali, pasha, were, marching, from, belgrade, towards, eugene, s, position, on, the, north, bank, of, the, danube, west, of, the, fortress, of, petrovaradin, the, grand, vizier, had, intended, to, seize, the, fortress, but, eugene, gave, him, no, chance, to, do, so, after, resisting, calls, for, caution, and, forgoing, a, council, of, war, the, prince, decided, to, attack, immediately, on, the, morning, of, 5, august, with, approximately, 70, 000, men, the, turkish, janissaries, had, some, initial, success, but, after, an, imperial, cavalry, attack, on, their, flank, ali, pasha, s, forces, fell, into, confusion, although, the, imperials, lost, almost, 5, 000, dead, or, wounded, the, turks, who, retreated, in, disorder, to, belgrade, seem, to, have, lost, double, that, amount, including, the, grand, vizier, himself, who, had, entered, the, m, l, e, and, subsequently, died, of, his, wounds, eugene, proceeded, to, take, the, banat, fortress, of, temeswar, in, mid, october, 1716, thus, ending, 164, years, of, turkish, rule, before, turning, his, attention, to, the, next, campaign, and, to, what, he, considered, the, main, goal, of, the, war, belgrade, situated, at, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, danube, and, sava, belgrade, held, a, garrison, of, 30, 000, men, under, serasker, mustapha, pasha, imperial, troops, besieged, the, place, in, mid, june, 1717, and, by, the, end, of, july, large, parts, of, the, city, had, been, destroyed, by, artillery, fire, by, the, first, days, of, august, however, a, huge, turkish, field, army, 150, 000, 200, 000, strong, under, the, new, grand, vizier, hac, halil, pasha, had, arrived, on, the, plateau, east, of, the, city, to, relieve, the, garrison, news, spread, through, europe, of, eugene, s, imminent, destruction, but, he, had, no, intention, of, lifting, the, siege, with, his, men, suffering, from, dysentery, and, continuous, bombardment, from, the, plateau, eugene, aware, that, a, decisive, victory, alone, could, extricate, his, army, decided, to, attack, the, relief, force, on, the, morning, of, 16, august, 40, 000, imperial, troops, marched, through, the, fog, caught, the, turks, unaware, and, routed, halil, pasha, s, army, a, week, later, belgrade, surrendered, effectively, bringing, an, end, to, the, war, the, victory, was, the, crowning, point, of, eugene, s, military, career, and, had, confirmed, him, as, the, leading, european, general, his, ability, to, snatch, victory, at, the, moment, of, defeat, had, shown, the, prince, at, his, best, the, principal, objectives, of, the, war, had, been, achieved, the, task, eugene, had, begun, at, zenta, was, complete, and, the, karlowitz, settlement, secured, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, passarowitz, signed, on, 21, july, 1718, the, turks, surrendered, the, banat, of, temeswar, along, with, belgrade, and, most, of, serbia, although, they, regained, the, morea, from, the, venetians, the, war, had, dispelled, the, immediate, turkish, threat, to, hungary, and, was, a, triumph, for, austria, and, for, eugene, personally, while, eugene, fought, the, turks, in, the, east, unresolved, issues, following, the, utrecht, rastatt, settlements, led, to, hostilities, between, the, emperor, and, philip, v, of, spain, in, the, west, charles, vi, had, refused, to, recognise, philip, v, as, king, of, spain, a, title, which, he, himself, claimed, in, return, philip, v, had, refused, to, renounce, his, claims, to, naples, milan, and, the, netherlands, all, of, which, had, transferred, to, the, house, of, austria, following, the, spanish, succession, war, philip, v, was, roused, by, his, influential, wife, elisabeth, farnese, daughter, of, the, hereditary, prince, of, parma, who, personally, held, dynastic, claims, in, the, name, of, her, son, charles, to, the, duchies, of, tuscany, parma, and, piacenza, representatives, from, a, newly, formed, anglo, french, alliance, who, were, desirous, of, european, peace, for, their, own, dynastic, securities, and, trade, opportunities, called, on, both, parties, to, recognise, each, other, s, sovereignty, yet, philip, v, remained, intractable, and, on, 22, august, 1717, his, chief, minister, alberoni, effected, the, invasion, of, austrian, sardinia, in, what, seemed, like, the, beginning, of, the, reconquest, of, spain, s, former, italian, empire, eugene, returned, to, vienna, from, his, recent, victory, at, belgrade, before, the, conclusion, of, the, turkish, war, determined, to, prevent, an, escalation, of, the, conflict, complaining, that, two, wars, cannot, be, waged, with, one, army, only, reluctantly, did, the, prince, release, some, troops, from, the, balkans, for, the, italian, campaign, rejecting, all, diplomatic, overtures, philip, v, unleashed, another, assault, in, june, 1718, this, time, against, savoyard, sicily, as, a, preliminary, to, attacking, the, italian, mainland, realizing, that, only, the, british, fleet, could, prevent, further, spanish, landings, and, that, pro, spanish, groups, in, france, might, push, the, regent, duke, of, orl, ans, into, war, against, austria, charles, vi, had, no, option, but, to, sign, the, quadruple, alliance, on, 2, august, 1718, and, formally, renounce, his, claim, to, spain, despite, the, spanish, fleet, s, destruction, off, cape, passaro, philip, v, and, elisabeth, remained, resolute, and, rejected, the, treaty, although, eugene, could, have, gone, south, after, the, conclusion, of, the, turkish, war, he, chose, instead, to, conduct, operations, from, vienna, but, austria, s, military, effort, in, sicily, proved, derisory, and, eugene, s, chosen, commanders, zum, jungen, and, later, count, mercy, performed, poorly, it, was, only, from, pressure, exerted, by, the, french, army, advancing, into, the, basque, provinces, of, northern, spain, in, april, 1719, and, the, british, navy, s, attacks, on, the, spanish, fleet, and, shipping, that, compelled, philip, v, and, elisabeth, to, dismiss, alberoni, and, join, the, quadruple, alliance, on, 25, january, 1720, nevertheless, the, spanish, attacks, had, strained, charles, vi, s, government, causing, tension, between, the, emperor, and, his, spanish, council, on, the, one, hand, and, the, conference, headed, by, eugene, on, the, other, despite, charles, vi, s, own, personal, ambitions, in, the, mediterranean, it, was, clear, to, the, emperor, that, eugene, had, put, the, safeguarding, of, his, conquests, in, hungary, before, everything, else, and, that, military, failure, in, sicily, also, had, to, rest, on, eugene, consequently, the, prince, s, influence, over, the, emperor, declined, considerably, eugene, had, become, governor, of, the, austrian, netherlands, in, june, 1716, but, he, was, an, absent, ruler, directing, policy, from, vienna, through, his, chosen, representative, the, marquis, of, pri, pri, proved, unpopular, with, the, local, population, and, the, guilds, who, following, the, barrier, treaty, of, 1715, were, obliged, to, meet, the, financial, demands, of, the, administration, and, the, dutch, barrier, garrisons, with, eugene, s, backing, and, encouragement, civil, disturbances, in, antwerp, and, brussels, were, forcibly, suppressed, after, displeasing, the, emperor, over, his, initial, opposition, to, the, formation, of, the, ostend, company, pri, also, lost, the, support, of, the, native, nobility, from, within, his, own, council, of, state, in, brussels, particularly, from, the, marquis, de, m, rode, westerloo, one, of, eugene, s, former, favourites, general, bonneval, also, joined, the, noblemen, in, opposition, to, pri, further, undermining, the, prince, when, pri, s, position, became, untenable, eugene, felt, compelled, to, resign, his, post, as, governor, of, the, austrian, netherlands, on, 16, november, 1724, as, compensation, charles, vi, conferred, on, him, the, honorary, position, as, vicar, general, of, italy, worth, 140, 000, gulden, a, year, and, an, estate, at, siebenbrunn, in, lower, austria, said, to, be, worth, double, that, amount, but, his, resignation, distressed, him, and, to, compound, his, concerns, eugene, caught, a, severe, bout, of, influenza, that, christmas, marking, the, beginning, of, permanent, bronchitis, and, acute, infections, every, winter, for, the, remaining, twelve, years, of, his, life, the, 1720s, saw, rapidly, changing, alliances, between, the, european, powers, and, almost, constant, diplomatic, confrontation, largely, over, unsolved, issues, regarding, the, quadruple, alliance, the, emperor, and, the, spanish, king, continued, to, use, each, other, s, titles, and, charles, vi, still, refused, to, remove, the, remaining, legal, obstacles, to, don, charles, eventual, succession, to, the, duchies, of, parma, and, tuscany, yet, in, a, surprise, move, spain, and, austria, moved, closer, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, vienna, in, april, may, 1725, in, response, britain, france, and, prussia, joined, together, in, the, alliance, of, hanover, to, counter, the, danger, to, europe, of, an, austro, spanish, hegemony, for, the, next, three, years, there, was, the, continual, threat, of, war, between, the, hanover, treaty, powers, and, the, austro, spanish, bloc, from, 1726, eugene, gradually, began, to, regain, his, political, influence, with, his, many, contacts, throughout, europe, eugene, backed, by, gundaker, starhemberg, and, count, sch, nborn, the, imperial, vice, chancellor, managed, to, secure, powerful, allies, and, strengthen, the, emperor, s, position, his, skill, in, managing, the, vast, secret, diplomatic, network, over, the, coming, years, was, the, main, reason, why, charles, vi, once, again, came, to, depend, upon, him, in, august, 1726, russia, acceded, to, the, austro, spanish, alliance, and, in, october, frederick, william, i, of, prussia, followed, suit, by, defecting, from, the, allies, with, the, signing, of, a, mutual, defensive, treaty, with, the, emperor, despite, the, conclusion, of, the, brief, anglo, spanish, conflict, manoeuvring, between, the, european, powers, persisted, throughout, 1727, 28, in, 1729, elisabeth, farnese, abandoned, the, austro, spanish, alliance, realizing, that, charles, vi, could, not, be, drawn, into, the, marriage, pact, she, wanted, elisabeth, concluded, that, the, best, way, to, secure, her, son, s, succession, to, parma, and, tuscany, now, lay, with, britain, and, france, to, eugene, it, was, an, event, that, which, is, seldom, to, be, found, in, history, following, the, prince, s, determined, lead, to, resist, all, pressure, charles, vi, sent, troops, into, italy, to, prevent, the, entry, of, spanish, garrisons, into, the, contested, duchies, by, the, beginning, of, 1730, eugene, who, had, remained, bellicose, throughout, the, whole, period, was, again, in, control, of, austrian, policy, in, britain, there, now, emerged, a, new, political, re, alignment, as, the, anglo, french, entente, became, increasingly, defunct, believing, that, a, resurgent, france, now, posed, the, greatest, danger, to, their, security, british, ministers, headed, by, robert, walpole, moved, to, reform, the, anglo, austrian, alliance, leading, to, the, signing, of, the, second, treaty, of, vienna, on, 16, march, 1731, eugene, had, been, the, austrian, minister, most, responsible, for, the, alliance, believing, once, again, it, would, provide, security, against, france, and, spain, the, treaty, compelled, charles, vi, to, sacrifice, the, ostend, company, and, accept, unequivocally, the, accession, of, don, charles, to, parma, and, tuscany, in, return, king, george, ii, as, king, of, great, britain, and, elector, of, electorate, of, hanover, guaranteed, the, pragmatic, sanction, the, device, to, secure, the, rights, of, the, emperor, s, daughter, maria, theresa, to, the, entire, habsburg, inheritance, it, was, largely, through, eugene, s, diplomacy, that, in, january, 1732, the, imperial, diet, also, guaranteed, the, pragmatic, sanction, which, together, with, the, treaties, with, britain, russia, and, prussia, marked, the, culmination, of, the, prince, s, diplomacy, but, the, treaty, of, vienna, had, infuriated, the, court, of, king, louis, xv, the, french, had, been, ignored, and, the, pragmatic, sanction, guaranteed, thus, increasing, habsburg, influence, and, confirming, austria, s, vast, territorial, size, the, emperor, also, intended, maria, theresa, to, marry, duke, francis, stephen, of, lorraine, which, would, present, an, unacceptable, threat, on, france, s, border, by, the, beginning, of, 1733, the, french, army, was, ready, for, war, all, that, was, needed, was, the, excuse, in, 1733, the, polish, king, and, elector, of, saxony, augustus, the, strong, died, there, were, two, candidates, for, his, successor, first, stanis, aw, leszczy, ski, the, father, in, law, of, louis, xv, second, the, elector, of, saxony, s, son, augustus, supported, by, russia, austria, and, prussia, the, polish, succession, had, afforded, louis, xv, s, chief, minister, fleury, the, opportunity, to, attack, austria, and, take, lorraine, from, francis, stephen, to, gain, spanish, support, france, backed, the, succession, of, elisabeth, farnese, s, sons, to, further, italian, lands, eugene, entered, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, as, president, of, the, imperial, war, council, and, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, but, he, was, severely, handicapped, by, the, quality, of, his, troops, and, the, shortage, of, funds, now, in, his, seventies, the, prince, was, also, burdened, by, rapidly, declining, physical, and, mental, powers, france, declared, war, on, austria, on, 10, october, 1733, but, without, the, funds, from, the, maritime, powers, who, despite, the, vienna, treaty, remained, neutral, throughout, the, war, austria, could, not, hire, the, necessary, troops, to, wage, an, offensive, campaign, the, danger, to, the, monarchy, wrote, eugene, to, the, emperor, in, october, cannot, be, exaggerated, by, the, end, of, the, year, french, forces, had, seized, lorraine, and, milan, by, early, 1734, spanish, troops, had, taken, sicily, eugene, took, command, on, the, rhine, in, april, 1734, but, vastly, outnumbered, he, was, forced, onto, the, defensive, in, june, eugene, set, out, to, relieve, philippsburg, yet, his, former, drive, and, energy, was, now, gone, accompanying, eugene, was, a, young, prince, frederick, of, prussia, sent, by, his, father, to, learn, the, art, of, war, frederick, gained, considerable, knowledge, from, eugene, recalling, in, later, life, his, great, debt, to, his, austrian, mentor, but, the, prussian, prince, was, aghast, at, eugene, s, condition, writing, later, his, body, was, still, there, but, his, soul, had, gone, eugene, conducted, another, cautious, campaign, in, 1735, once, again, pursuing, a, sensible, defensive, strategy, on, limited, resources, but, his, short, term, memory, was, by, now, practically, non, existent, and, his, political, influence, disappeared, completely, gundaker, starhemberg, and, johann, christoph, von, bartenstein, now, dominated, the, conference, in, his, place, fortunately, for, charles, vi, fleury, was, determined, to, limit, the, scope, of, the, war, and, in, october, 1735, he, granted, generous, peace, preliminaries, to, the, emperor, eugene, returned, to, vienna, from, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, in, october, 1735, weak, and, feeble, when, maria, theresa, and, francis, stephen, married, in, february, 1736, eugene, was, too, ill, to, attend, after, playing, cards, at, countess, batthy, ny, s, on, the, evening, of, 20, april, until, nine, in, the, evening, he, returned, home, to, the, stadtpalais, his, attendant, offered, him, to, take, his, prescribed, medicine, which, eugene, declined, when, his, servants, arrived, to, wake, him, the, next, morning, on, 21, april, 1736, they, found, prince, eugene, dead, after, passing, away, quietly, during, the, night, it, has, been, said, that, on, the, same, morning, he, was, discovered, dead, the, great, lion, in, his, menagerie, was, also, found, dead, eugene, s, heart, was, buried, with, the, ashes, of, his, ancestors, in, turin, in, the, basilica, of, superga, his, remains, were, carried, in, a, long, procession, to, st, stephen, s, cathedral, where, his, embalmed, body, was, buried, in, the, kreuzkapelle, it, is, said, that, the, emperor, himself, attended, as, a, mourner, without, anybody, s, knowledge, the, prince, s, niece, maria, anna, victoria, whom, he, had, never, met, inherited, eugene, s, immense, possessions, within, a, few, years, she, sold, off, the, palaces, the, country, estates, and, the, art, collection, of, a, man, who, had, become, one, of, the, wealthiest, in, europe, after, arriving, in, vienna, as, a, refugee, with, empty, pockets, being, an, italian, by, descent, a, frenchman, by, birth, and, a, german, by, adoption, prince, eugene, signed, himself, appropriately, using, the, trilingual, form, eugenio, von, savoye, italian, eugenio, german, von, french, savoye, eugene, never, married, and, was, reported, to, have, said, that, a, woman, was, a, hindrance, in, a, war, and, that, a, soldier, should, never, marry, according, to, some, of, his, contemporaries, eugene, s, loss, at, the, 1712, battle, of, denain, was, due, to, the, presence, of, an, italian, lady, that, he, took, with, him, on, the, campaign, this, was, confirmed, by, voltaire, who, reported, meeting, the, lady, in, question, according, to, nicholas, henderson, eugene, was, called, mars, without, venus, for, being, a, lifelong, bachelor, winston, churchill, in, his, biography, of, the, 1st, duke, of, marlborough, described, eugene, as, a, bachelor, almost, a, misogynist, disdainful, of, money, content, with, his, bright, sword, and, his, lifelong, animosity, against, louis, xiv, during, the, last, 20, years, of, his, life, eug, ne, had, a, relationship, with, one, woman, hungarian, countess, eleonore, batthy, ny, strattmann, the, widowed, daughter, of, the, former, hofkanzler, theodor, von, strattman, much, of, their, acquaintance, remains, speculative, since, eugene, left, no, personal, papers, only, letters, of, war, diplomacy, and, politics, eug, ne, and, eleonore, were, constant, companions, meeting, for, dinner, receptions, and, card, games, almost, every, day, till, his, death, although, they, lived, apart, most, foreign, diplomats, assumed, that, eleonore, was, his, long, time, mistress, it, is, not, known, precisely, when, their, relationship, began, but, his, acquisition, of, a, property, in, hungary, after, the, battle, of, zenta, near, rechnitz, castle, made, them, neighbours, in, the, years, immediately, following, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, she, began, to, be, mentioned, regularly, in, diplomatic, correspondence, as, eugen, s, egeria, and, within, a, few, years, she, was, referred, to, as, his, constant, companion, and, his, mistress, when, asked, if, she, and, the, prince, would, marry, countess, batthy, ny, replied, i, love, him, too, well, for, that, i, would, rather, have, a, bad, reputation, than, deprive, him, of, his, rumours, about, eugene, s, sexual, orientation, can, be, traced, back, to, his, teenage, years, it, has, since, been, established, that, the, source, of, these, rumours, was, elizabeth, charlotte, duchess, of, orl, ans, a, renowned, gossipmonger, at, versailles, whose, husband, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, happened, to, be, the, brother, of, french, king, louis, xiv, eugene, s, lifelong, adversary, the, duchess, documented, what, she, claimed, were, youthful, indiscretions, involving, eugene, including, alleged, incidents, with, lackeys, and, pages, according, to, her, he, was, denied, an, ecclesiastical, benefice, due, to, his, depravity, eugene, s, biographer, historian, helmut, oehler, acknowledged, the, duchess, s, comments, but, attributed, them, to, her, personal, animosity, toward, the, prince, in, his, memoirs, eugene, aware, of, the, malicious, rumours, derisively, addressed, them, calling, them, the, invented, anecdotes, from, the, gallery, of, versailles, whether, or, not, eugene, had, homosexual, relationships, in, his, youth, the, duchess, s, remarks, about, him, were, made, years, later, and, only, after, eugene, had, severely, humiliated, the, armies, of, her, brother, in, law, the, king, of, france, following, eugene, s, departure, from, france, at, nineteen, and, spanning, until, his, death, at, seventy, two, there, were, no, subsequent, insinuations, of, homosexuality, being, among, the, wealthiest, and, most, celebrated, figures, of, his, era, inevitably, led, to, animosity, for, eugene, as, envy, and, malice, trailed, him, from, the, battlefields, to, vienna, his, former, subordinate, guido, starhemberg, emerged, as, a, persistent, and, bitter, critic, of, eugene, s, renown, starhemberg, according, to, montesquieu, gained, notoriety, at, the, court, of, vienna, as, eugene, s, primary, rival, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, johann, matthias, von, der, schulenburg, another, bitter, rival, who, had, served, under, eugene, in, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, expressed, disdain, for, the, prince, schulenburg, whose, ambitions, to, command, the, austrian, army, had, been, thwarted, by, eugene, wrote, that, the, prince, has, no, idea, but, to, fight, whenever, the, opportunity, offers, he, thinks, that, nothing, equals, the, name, of, imperialists, before, whom, all, should, bend, the, knee, he, loves, la, petite, d, bauche, et, la, p, above, all, things, german, journalist, curt, martin, riess, reads, it, as, a, testament, to, sodomy, while, eugene, s, primary, biographer, german, historian, max, braubach, interpreted, la, p, as, referring, to, paillardize, fornication, prostitution, or, puterie, i, e, whoring, during, his, tenure, as, governor, general, of, the, austrian, netherlands, eugene, developed, a, reputation, for, frequenting, an, exclusive, brothel, on, amsterdam, s, prinsengracht, the, keeper, of, the, establishment, known, as, madame, therese, was, familiar, with, eugene, s, patronage, notably, eugene, once, brought, the, english, consul, in, amsterdam, with, him, a, drawing, by, cornelis, troost, housed, at, the, rijksmuseum, the, national, museum, of, the, netherlands, illustrates, a, scene, in, which, prince, eugene, had, the, available, women, parade, in, review, just, as, he, did, his, own, troops, according, to, the, museum, troost, based, his, drawing, on, an, anecdote, circulating, at, the, time, eugene, s, other, friends, such, as, the, papal, nuncio, domenico, silvio, passionei, who, delivered, the, funeral, oration, of, prince, eugene, made, up, for, the, family, of, his, own, that, he, lacked, for, his, only, surviving, nephew, emmanuel, thomas, the, son, of, his, brother, louis, thomas, eugene, arranged, marriage, with, princess, maria, theresia, of, liechtenstein, duchess, of, troppau, but, emmanuel, died, of, smallpox, in, 1729, eugene, then, turned, his, attention, to, his, grand, nephew, eugene, jean, emanuel, s, only, son, who, now, remained, his, last, living, male, heir, aiming, at, establishing, a, second, savoy, state, in, central, italy, he, requested, for, the, young, count, the, hand, of, the, seven, year, old, sovereign, duchess, of, massa, and, princess, of, carrara, maria, teresa, cybo, malaspina, at, the, time, under, her, mother, s, regency, obtaining, the, approval, of, emperor, charles, vi, and, the, king, of, sardinia, charles, emmanuel, iii, whom, he, looked, to, as, the, head, of, the, extended, house, of, savoy, matrimonial, agreements, were, signed, in, vienna, on, 2, may, 1732, but, the, marriage, never, took, place, due, to, eugene, jean, s, premature, death, in, mannheim, where, he, was, serving, the, emperor, in, the, military, on, 23, november, 1734, eugene, s, closest, relative, was, now, louis, thomas, s, unmarried, daughter, and, eugene, jean, s, aunt, princess, maria, anna, victoria, of, savoy, whom, prince, eugene, had, never, met, and, had, made, no, effort, to, do, so, and, who, became, nevertheless, in, the, absence, of, a, will, the, legal, heiress, of, all, his, assets, she, was, preferred, to, prince, eugene, s, cousin, victor, amadeus, of, carignan, the, son, of, his, father, s, eldest, brother, who, was, also, still, alive, eugene, s, rewards, for, his, victories, his, share, of, booty, his, revenues, from, his, abbeys, in, savoy, and, a, steady, income, from, his, imperial, offices, and, governorships, enabled, him, to, contribute, to, the, landscape, of, baroque, architecture, eugene, spent, most, of, his, life, in, vienna, at, his, winter, palace, the, stadtpalais, built, by, fischer, von, erlach, the, palace, acted, as, his, official, residence, and, home, but, for, reasons, that, remain, speculative, the, prince, s, association, with, fischer, ended, before, the, building, was, complete, favouring, instead, johann, lukas, von, hildebrandt, as, his, chief, architect, eugene, first, employed, hildebrandt, to, finish, the, stadtpalais, before, commissioning, him, to, prepare, plans, for, a, palace, on, his, danubian, island, at, r, ckeve, the, savoy, castle, in, r, ckeve, begun, in, 1701, the, single, story, building, took, twenty, years, to, complete, yet, probably, because, of, the, r, k, czi, revolt, the, prince, seems, to, have, visited, it, only, once, after, the, siege, of, belgrade, in, 1717, of, more, importance, was, the, grandiose, complex, of, the, two, belvedere, palaces, in, vienna, the, single, storey, lower, belvedere, with, its, exotic, gardens, and, zoo, was, completed, in, 1716, the, upper, belvedere, completed, between, 1720, and, 1722, is, a, more, substantial, building, with, sparkling, white, stucco, walls, and, copper, roof, it, became, a, wonder, of, europe, eugene, and, hildebrandt, also, converted, an, existing, structure, on, his, marchfeld, estate, into, a, country, seat, the, schloss, hof, situated, between, the, rivers, danube, and, morava, the, building, completed, in, 1729, was, far, less, elaborate, than, his, other, projects, but, it, was, strong, enough, to, serve, as, a, fortress, in, case, of, need, eugene, spent, much, of, his, spare, time, there, in, his, last, years, accommodating, large, hunting, parties, in, the, years, following, the, peace, of, rastatt, eugene, became, acquainted, with, a, large, number, of, scholarly, men, given, his, position, and, responsiveness, they, were, keen, to, meet, him, few, could, exist, without, patronage, and, this, was, probably, the, main, reason, for, gottfried, leibniz, s, association, with, him, in, 1714, eugene, also, befriended, the, french, writer, jean, baptiste, rousseau, who, by, 1716, was, receiving, financial, support, from, eugene, rousseau, stayed, on, attached, to, the, prince, s, household, probably, helping, in, the, library, until, he, left, for, the, netherlands, in, 1722, another, acquaintance, montesquieu, already, famous, for, his, persian, letters, when, he, arrived, in, vienna, in, 1728, favourably, recalled, his, time, spent, at, the, prince, s, table, nevertheless, eugene, had, no, literary, pretensions, of, his, own, and, was, not, tempted, like, maurice, de, saxe, or, marshal, villars, to, write, his, memoirs, or, books, on, the, art, of, war, he, did, however, become, a, collector, on, the, grandest, scale, his, picture, galleries, were, filled, with, 16th, and, 17th, century, italian, dutch, and, flemish, art, his, library, at, the, stadtpalais, crammed, with, over, 15, 000, books, 237, manuscripts, as, well, as, a, huge, collection, of, prints, of, particular, interest, were, books, on, natural, history, and, geography, it, is, hardly, believable, wrote, rousseau, that, a, man, who, carries, on, his, shoulders, the, burden, of, almost, all, the, affairs, of, europe, should, find, as, much, time, to, read, as, though, he, had, nothing, else, to, do, at, eugene, s, death, his, possessions, and, estates, except, those, in, hungary, which, the, crown, reclaimed, went, to, his, niece, princess, maria, anna, victoria, who, at, once, decided, to, sell, everything, the, artwork, was, bought, by, charles, emmanuel, iii, of, sardinia, eugene, s, library, prints, and, drawings, were, purchased, by, the, emperor, in, 1737, and, have, since, passed, into, austrian, national, collections, napoleon, considered, eugene, one, of, the, eight, greatest, commanders, of, history, although, later, military, critics, have, disagreed, with, that, assessment, eugene, was, undoubtedly, the, greatest, austrian, general, he, was, no, military, innovator, but, he, had, the, ability, to, make, an, inadequate, system, work, he, was, equally, adept, as, an, organiser, strategist, and, tactician, believing, in, the, primacy, of, battle, and, his, ability, to, seize, the, opportune, moment, to, launch, a, successful, attack, the, important, thing, wrote, maurice, de, saxe, in, his, reveries, is, to, see, the, opportunity, and, to, know, how, to, use, it, prince, eugene, possessed, this, quality, which, is, the, greatest, in, the, art, of, war, and, which, is, the, test, of, the, most, elevated, genius, this, fluidity, was, key, to, his, battlefield, successes, in, italy, and, in, his, wars, against, the, turks, nevertheless, in, the, low, countries, particularly, after, the, battle, of, oudenarde, in, 1708, eugene, like, his, cousin, louis, of, baden, tended, to, play, safe, and, become, bogged, down, in, a, conservative, strategy, of, sieges, and, defending, supply, lines, after, the, attempt, on, toulon, in, 1707, he, also, became, very, wary, of, combined, land, sea, operations, to, historian, derek, mckay, the, main, criticism, of, him, as, a, general, is, his, legacy, he, left, no, school, of, officers, nor, an, army, able, to, function, without, him, eugene, was, a, disciplinarian, when, ordinary, soldiers, disobeyed, orders, he, was, prepared, to, shoot, them, himself, but, he, rejected, blind, brutality, writing, you, should, only, be, harsh, when, as, often, happens, kindness, proves, useless, on, the, battlefield, eugene, demanded, courage, in, his, subordinates, and, expected, his, men, to, fight, where, and, when, he, wanted, his, criteria, for, promotion, were, based, primarily, on, obedience, to, orders, and, courage, on, the, battlefield, rather, than, social, position, on, the, whole, his, men, responded, because, he, was, willing, to, push, himself, as, hard, as, them, his, position, as, president, of, the, imperial, war, council, proved, less, successful, following, the, long, period, of, peace, after, the, austro, turkish, war, the, idea, of, creating, a, separate, field, army, or, providing, garrison, troops, with, effective, training, for, them, to, be, turned, into, such, an, army, quickly, was, never, considered, by, eugene, by, the, time, of, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, therefore, the, austrians, were, outclassed, by, a, better, prepared, french, force, for, this, eugene, was, largely, to, blame, in, his, view, unlike, the, drilling, and, manoeuvres, carried, out, by, the, prussians, which, to, eugene, seemed, irrelevant, to, real, warfare, the, time, to, create, actual, fighting, men, was, when, war, came, although, frederick, ii, of, prussia, had, been, struck, by, the, muddle, of, the, austrian, army, and, its, poor, organisation, during, the, polish, succession, war, he, later, amended, his, initial, harsh, judgements, if, i, understand, anything, of, my, trade, commented, frederick, in, 1758, especially, in, the, more, difficult, aspects, i, owe, that, advantage, to, prince, eugene, from, him, i, learnt, to, hold, grand, objectives, constantly, in, view, and, direct, all, my, resources, to, those, ends, to, historian, christopher, duffy, it, was, this, awareness, of, the, grand, strategy, that, was, eugene, s, legacy, to, frederick, to, his, responsibilities, eugene, attached, his, own, personal, values, physical, courage, loyalty, to, his, sovereign, honesty, self, control, in, all, things, and, he, expected, these, qualities, from, his, commanders, eugene, s, approach, was, dictatorial, but, he, was, willing, to, co, operate, with, someone, he, regarded, as, his, equal, such, as, baden, or, marlborough, yet, the, contrast, with, his, co, commander, of, the, spanish, succession, war, was, stark, according, to, churchill, marlborough, was, the, model, husband, and, father, concerned, with, building, up, a, home, founding, a, family, and, gathering, a, fortune, to, sustain, it, whereas, eugene, the, bachelor, was, disdainful, of, money, content, with, his, bright, sword, and, his, lifelong, animosities, against, louis, xiv, the, result, was, an, austere, figure, inspiring, respect, and, admiration, rather, than, affection, sicco, van, goslinga, one, of, the, dutch, field, deputies, who, worked, very, close, with, eugene, during, his, campaigns, with, marlborough, described, him, in, his, memoires, as, follows, he, had, untameable, courage, and, outdid, himself, during, battle, and, in, all, undertakings, where, vigorous, action, was, required, but, he, was, less, skilled, in, matters, requiring, brainwork, perseverance, prudence, and, constant, attention, like, when, it, was, necessary, to, take, up, a, defensive, position, carefully, supply, it, with, everything, necessary, for, its, preservation, and, watch, over, its, security, he, was, unable, to, concern, himself, with, ancillary, matters, which, are, so, necessary, for, the, security, of, an, army, it, was, said, that, he, needed, a, new, army, every, year, implying, that, he, had, little, concern, for, the, lives, of, soldiers, several, ships, have, been, named, in, eugene, s, honour
