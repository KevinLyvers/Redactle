leo, hendrik, baekeland, honfrse, november, 14, 1863, february, 23, 1944, was, a, belgian, chemist, educated, in, belgium, and, germany, he, spent, most, of, his, career, in, the, united, states, he, is, best, known, for, the, inventions, of, velox, photographic, paper, in, 1893, and, bakelite, in, 1907, he, has, been, called, the, father, of, the, plastics, industry, for, his, invention, of, bakelite, an, inexpensive, non, flammable, and, versatile, plastic, which, marked, the, beginning, of, the, modern, plastics, industry, leo, baekeland, was, born, in, ghent, belgium, on, november, 14, 1863, the, son, of, a, cobbler, charles, baekeland, and, a, house, maid, rosalia, merchie, his, siblings, were, elodia, maria, baekeland, melonia, leonia, baekeland, edmundus, baekeland, rachel, helena, baekeland, and, delphina, baekeland, he, told, the, literary, digest, the, name, is, a, dutch, word, meaning, land, of, beacons, he, spent, much, of, his, early, life, in, ghent, belgium, he, graduated, with, honours, from, the, ghent, municipal, technical, school, and, was, awarded, a, scholarship, by, the, city, of, ghent, 102, to, study, chemistry, at, the, ghent, university, which, he, entered, in, 1880, 13, he, acquired, a, phd, maxima, cum, laude, at, the, age, of, 21, 102, after, a, brief, appointment, as, professor, of, physics, and, chemistry, at, the, government, higher, normal, school, in, bruges, 1887, 1889, he, was, appointed, associate, professor, of, chemistry, at, ghent, university, in, 1889, 14, baekeland, married, c, line, swarts, 1868, 1944, on, august, 8, 1889, and, they, had, two, children, one, of, their, grandsons, brooks, whose, father, was, george, washington, baekeland, married, the, model, barbara, daly, a, k, a, barbara, daly, baekeland, in, 1942, and, had, one, child, a, boy, named, anthony, tony, baekeland, in, 1889, baekeland, and, his, wife, c, line, took, advantage, of, a, travel, scholarship, to, visit, universities, in, england, and, the, united, states, 178, 14, they, visited, new, york, city, where, he, met, professor, charles, f, chandler, of, columbia, university, and, richard, anthony, of, the, e, and, h, t, anthony, photographic, company, professor, chandler, was, influential, in, convincing, baekeland, to, stay, in, the, united, states, baekeland, had, already, invented, a, process, to, develop, photographic, plates, using, water, instead, of, other, chemicals, which, he, had, patented, in, belgium, in, 1887, 13, although, this, method, was, unreliable, anthony, saw, potential, in, the, young, chemist, and, offered, him, a, job, 127, 130, baekeland, worked, for, the, anthony, company, for, two, years, and, in, 1891, set, up, in, business, for, himself, working, as, a, consulting, chemist, 130, however, a, spell, of, illness, and, disappearing, funds, made, him, rethink, his, actions, and, he, decided, to, return, to, his, old, interest, of, producing, a, photographic, paper, that, would, allow, enlargements, to, be, printed, by, artificial, light, after, two, years, of, intensive, effort, he, perfected, the, process, to, produce, the, paper, which, he, named, velox, it, was, the, first, commercially, successful, photographic, paper, at, the, time, the, us, was, suffering, a, recession, and, there, were, no, investors, or, buyers, for, his, proposed, new, product, so, baekeland, became, partners, with, leonard, jacobi, and, established, the, nepera, chemical, company, in, nepera, park, yonkers, new, york, 131, 135, in, 1899, jacobi, baekeland, and, albert, hahn, a, further, associate, sold, nepera, to, george, eastman, of, the, eastman, kodak, co, for, 750, 000, baekeland, earned, approximately, 215, 000, net, through, the, transaction, 134, 136, with, a, portion, of, the, money, he, purchased, snug, rock, a, house, in, yonkers, new, york, where, he, set, up, his, own, well, equipped, laboratory, there, he, later, said, in, comfortable, financial, circumstances, a, free, man, ready, to, devote, myself, again, to, my, favorite, studies, i, enjoyed, for, several, years, that, great, blessing, the, luxury, of, not, being, interrupted, in, one, s, favorite, work, one, of, the, requirements, of, the, nepera, sale, was, in, effect, a, non, compete, clause, baekeland, agreed, not, to, do, research, in, photography, for, at, least, 20, years, he, would, have, to, find, a, new, area, of, research, his, first, step, was, to, go, to, germany, in, 1900, for, a, refresher, in, electrochemistry, at, the, technical, institute, at, charlottenburg, 14, upon, returning, to, the, united, states, baekeland, was, involved, briefly, but, successfully, in, helping, clinton, paul, townsend, and, elon, huntington, hooker, to, develop, a, production, quality, electrolytic, cell, baekeland, was, hired, as, an, independent, consultant, with, the, responsibility, of, constructing, and, operating, a, pilot, plant, 138, 139, baekeland, developed, a, stronger, diaphragm, cell, for, the, chloralkali, process, using, woven, asbestos, cloth, filled, with, a, mixture, of, iron, oxide, asbestos, fibre, and, iron, hydroxide, baekeland, s, improvements, were, important, to, the, founding, of, hooker, chemical, company, and, the, construction, of, one, of, the, world, s, largest, electrochemical, plants, at, niagara, falls, baekeland, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1935, and, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1936, having, been, successful, with, velox, baekeland, set, out, to, find, another, promising, area, for, chemical, development, as, he, had, done, with, velox, he, looked, for, a, problem, that, offered, the, best, chance, for, the, quickest, possible, results, asked, why, he, entered, the, field, of, synthetic, resins, baekeland, answered, that, his, intention, was, to, make, money, by, the, 1900s, chemists, had, begun, to, recognize, that, many, of, the, natural, resins, and, fibers, were, polymeric, a, term, introduced, in, 1833, by, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, adolf, von, baeyer, had, experimented, with, phenols, and, formaldehydes, in, 1872, particularly, pyrogallol, and, benzaldehyde, he, created, a, black, guck, which, he, considered, useless, and, irrelevant, to, his, search, for, synthetic, dyes, 115, baeyer, s, student, werner, kleeberg, experimented, with, phenol, and, formaldehyde, in, 1891, but, as, baekeland, noted, could, not, crystallize, this, mess, nor, purify, it, to, constant, composition, nor, in, fact, do, anything, with, it, once, produced, baekeland, began, to, investigate, the, reactions, of, phenol, and, formaldehyde, he, familiarized, himself, with, previous, work, and, approached, the, field, systematically, carefully, controlling, and, examining, the, effects, of, temperature, pressure, and, the, types, and, proportions, of, materials, used, 144, 145, the, first, application, that, appeared, promising, was, the, development, of, a, synthetic, replacement, for, shellac, made, from, the, secretion, of, lac, beetles, baekeland, produced, a, soluble, phenol, formaldehyde, shellac, called, novolak, but, concluded, that, its, properties, were, inferior, it, never, became, a, big, market, success, but, is, still, used, to, this, day, e, g, as, a, photoresist, baekeland, continued, to, explore, possible, combinations, of, phenol, and, formaldehyde, intrigued, by, the, possibility, that, such, materials, could, be, used, in, molding, by, controlling, the, pressure, and, temperature, applied, to, phenol, and, formaldehyde, he, produced, his, dreamed, of, hard, moldable, plastic, bakelite, bakelite, was, made, from, phenol, then, known, as, carbolic, acid, and, formaldehyde, the, chemical, name, of, bakelite, is, polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, in, compression, molding, the, resin, is, generally, combined, with, fillers, such, as, wood, or, asbestos, before, pressing, it, directly, into, the, final, shape, of, the, product, baekeland, s, process, patent, for, making, insoluble, products, of, phenol, and, formaldehyde, was, filed, in, july, 1907, and, granted, on, december, 7, 1909, in, february, 1909, baekeland, officially, announced, his, achievement, at, a, meeting, of, the, new, york, section, of, the, american, chemical, society, in, 1917, baekeland, became, a, professor, by, special, appointment, at, columbia, university, 87, the, smithsonian, has, documents, from, the, county, courthouse, for, westchester, county, in, white, plains, new, york, indicating, that, he, was, admitted, to, u, s, citizenship, on, december, 16, 1919, in, 1922, after, patent, litigation, favorable, to, baekeland, the, general, bakelite, co, which, he, had, founded, in, 1910, along, with, the, condensite, co, founded, by, aylesworth, and, the, redmanol, chemical, products, company, founded, by, lawrence, v, redman, were, merged, into, the, bakelite, corporation, the, invention, of, bakelite, marks, the, beginning, of, the, age, of, plastics, bakelite, was, the, first, plastic, invented, that, retained, its, shape, after, being, heated, radios, telephones, and, electrical, insulators, were, made, of, bakelite, because, of, its, excellent, electrical, insulation, and, heat, resistance, soon, its, applications, spread, to, most, branches, of, industry, baekeland, received, many, awards, and, honors, both, during, his, lifetime, and, beyond, including, the, perkin, medal, in, 1916, and, the, franklin, medal, in, 1940, in, 1974, he, was, posthumously, inducted, into, the, plastics, hall, of, fame, and, in, 1978, he, was, likewise, inducted, into, the, national, inventors, hall, of, fame, in, akron, ohio, at, the, time, of, baekeland, s, death, in, 1944, the, world, production, of, bakelite, was, ca, 175, 000, tons, and, it, was, used, in, over, 15, 000, different, products, he, held, more, than, 100, patents, including, processes, for, the, separation, of, copper, and, cadmium, and, for, the, impregnation, of, wood, as, baekeland, grew, older, he, became, more, eccentric, entering, fierce, battles, with, his, son, and, presumptive, heir, over, salary, and, other, issues, he, sold, the, general, bakelite, company, to, union, carbide, in, 1939, and, at, his, son, s, prompting, he, retired, he, became, a, recluse, eating, all, of, his, meals, from, cans, and, becoming, obsessed, with, developing, an, immense, tropical, garden, on, his, winter, estate, in, coconut, grove, florida, he, died, of, a, stroke, in, a, sanatorium, in, beacon, new, york, in, 1944, baekeland, is, buried, in, sleepy, hollow, cemetery, in, sleepy, hollow, new, york, jenny, nina, rose, baekeland, october, 9, 1890, 1895, george, washington, baekeland, february, 8, 1895, january, 31, 1966, nina, baekeland, july, 22, 1896, may, 19, 1975
