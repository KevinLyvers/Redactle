encountered, financial, difficulties, due, to, his, lack, of, success, as, a, farmer, in, order, to, make, enough, money, to, support, a, family, he, accepted, a, job, offer, from, patrick, douglas, an, absentee, landowner, who, lived, in, cumnock, to, work, on, his, sugar, plantations, near, port, antonio, jamaica, douglas, plantations, were, managed, by, his, brother, charles, and, the, job, offer, which, had, a, salary, of, 30, per, annum, entailed, working, in, jamaica, as, a, book, keeper, whose, duties, included, serving, as, an, assistant, overseer, to, the, black, slaves, on, the, plantations, burns, himself, described, the, position, as, being, a, poor, negro, driver, the, position, which, was, for, a, single, man, would, entail, burns, living, on, a, plantation, in, rustic, conditions, as, it, was, unlikely, a, book, keeper, would, be, housed, in, the, plantation, s, great, house, apologists, have, argued, in, burns, s, defence, that, in, 1786, the, scottish, abolitionist, movement, was, just, beginning, to, be, broadly, active, burns, s, authorship, of, the, slave, s, lament, a, 1792, poem, argued, as, an, example, of, his, abolitionist, views, is, disputed, his, name, is, absent, from, any, abolitionist, petition, written, in, scotland, during, the, period, and, according, to, academic, lisa, williams, burns, is, strangely, silent, on, the, question, of, chattel, slavery, compared, to, other, contemporary, poets, perhaps, this, was, due, to, his, government, position, severe, limitations, on, free, speech, at, the, time, or, his, association, with, beneficiaries, of, the, slave, trade, system, around, the, same, time, burns, fell, in, love, with, a, woman, named, mary, campbell, whom, he, had, seen, in, church, while, he, was, still, living, in, tarbolton, she, was, born, near, dunoon, and, had, lived, in, campbeltown, before, moving, to, work, in, ayrshire, he, dedicated, the, poems, the, highland, lassie, o, highland, mary, and, to, mary, in, heaven, to, her, his, song, will, ye, go, to, the, indies, my, mary, and, leave, auld, scotia, s, shore, suggests, that, they, planned, to, emigrate, to, jamaica, together, their, relationship, has, been, the, subject, of, much, conjecture, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, on, 14, may, 1786, they, exchanged, bibles, and, plighted, their, troth, over, the, water, of, fail, in, a, traditional, form, of, marriage, soon, afterwards, mary, campbell, left, her, work, in, ayrshire, went, to, the, seaport, of, greenock, and, sailed, home, to, her, parents, in, campbeltown, in, october, 1786, mary, and, her, father, sailed, from, campbeltown, to, visit, her, brother, in, greenock, her, brother, fell, ill, with, typhus, which, she, also, caught, while, nursing, him, she, died, of, typhus, on, 20, or, 21, october, 1786, and, was, buried, there, as, burns, lacked, the, funds, to, pay, for, his, passage, to, jamaica, gavin, hamilton, suggested, that, he, should, publish, his, poems, in, the, meantime, by, subscription, as, a, likely, way, of, getting, a, little, money, to, provide, him, more, liberally, in, necessaries, for, jamaica, on, 3, april, burns, sent, proposals, for, publishing, his, scotch, poems, to, john, wilson, a, printer, in, kilmarnock, who, published, these, proposals, on, 14, april, 1786, on, the, same, day, that, jean, armour, s, father, tore, up, the, paper, in, which, burns, attested, his, marriage, to, jean, to, obtain, a, certificate, that, he, was, a, free, bachelor, burns, agreed, on, 25, june, to, stand, for,

july, 1786, john, wilson, published, the, volume, of, works, by, robert, burns, poems, chiefly, in, the, scottish, dialect, known, as, the, kilmarnock, volume, it, sold, for, 3, shillings, and, contained, much, of, his, best, writing, including, the, twa, dogs, which, features, luath, his, border, collie, address, to, the, deil, halloween, the, cotter, s, saturday, night, to, a, mouse, epitaph, for, james, smith, and, to, a, mountain, daisy, many, of, which, had, been, written, at, mossgiel, farm, the, success, of, the, work, was, immediate, and, soon, he, was, known, across, the, country, burns, postponed, his, planned, emigration, to, jamaica, on, 1, september, and, was, at, mossgiel, two, days, later, when, he, learnt, that, jean, armour, had, given, birth, to, twins, on, 4, september, thomas, blacklock, wrote, a, letter, expressing, admiration, for, the, poetry, in, the, kilmarnock, volume, and, suggesting, an, enlarged, second, edition, a, copy, of, it, was, passed, to, burns, who, later, recalled, i, had, taken, the, last, farewell, of, my, few, friends, my, chest, was, on, the, road, to, greenock, i, had, composed, the, last, song, i, should, ever, measure, in, scotland, the, gloomy, night, is, gathering, fast, when, a, letter, from, dr, blacklock, to, a, friend, of, mine, overthrew, all, my, schemes, by, opening, new, prospects, to, my, poetic, ambition, the, doctor, belonged, to, a, set, of, critics, for, whose, applause, i, had, not, dared, to, hope, his, opinion, that, i, would, meet, with, encouragement, in, edinburgh, for, a, second, edition, fired, me, so, much, that, away, i, posted, for, that, city, without, a, single, acquaintance, or, a, single, letter, of, introduction, on, 27, november, 1786, burns, borrowed, a, pony, and, set, out, for, edinburgh, on, 14, december, william, creech, issued, subscription, bills, for, the, first, edinburgh, edition, of, poems, chiefly, in, the, scottish, dialect, which, was, published, on, 17,

length, portrait, now, in, the, scottish, national, portrait, gallery, which, was, engraved, to, provide, a, frontispiece, for, the, book, nasmyth, had, come, to, know, burns, and, his, fresh, and, appealing, image, has, become, the, basis, for, almost, all, subsequent, representations, of, the, poet, in, edinburgh, he, was, received, as, an, equal, by, the, city, s, men, of, letters, including, dugald, stewart, robertson, blair, and, others, and, was, a, guest, at, aristocratic, gatherings, where, he, bore, himself, with, unaffected, dignity, here, he, encountered, and, made, a, lasting, impression, on, the, 16, year, old, walter, scott, who, described, him, later, with, great, admiration, his, manners, rustic, not, clownish, a, sort, of, dignified, plainness, and, simplicity, which, received, part, of, its, effect, perhaps, from, knowledge, of, his, extraordinary, talents, his, features, are, presented, in, mr, nasmyth, s, picture, but, to, me, it, conveys, the, idea, that, they, are, diminished, as, if, seen, in, perspective, i, think, his, countenance, was, more, massive, than, it, looks, in, any, of, the, portraits, there, was, a, strong, expression, of, shrewdness, in, all, his, lineaments, the, eye, alone, i, think, indicated, the, poetical, character, and, temperament, it, was, large, and, of, a, dark, cast, and, literally, glowed, when, he, spoke, with, feeling, or, interest, the, new, edition, of, his, poems, brought, burns, 400, his, stay, in, the, city, also, resulted, in, some, lifelong, friendships, among, which, were, those, with, lord, glencairn, and, frances, anna, dunlop, 1730, 1815, who, became, his, occasional, sponsor, and, with, whom, he, corresponded, for, many, years, until, a, rift, developed, he, embarked, on, a, relationship, with, the, separated, agnes, nancy, mclehose, 1758, 1841, with, whom, he, exchanged, passionate, letters, under, pseudonyms, burns, called, himself, sylvander, and, nancy, clarinda, when, it, became, clear, that, nancy, would, not, be, easily, seduced, into, a, physical, relationship, burns, moved, on, to, jenny, clow, 1766, 1792, nancy, s, domestic, servant, who, bore, him, a, son, robert, burns, clow, in, 1788, he, also, had, an, affair, with, a, servant, girl, margaret, may, cameron, his, relationship, with, nancy, concluded, in, 1791, with, a, final, meeting, in, edinburgh, before, she, sailed, to, jamaica, for, what, turned, out, to, be, a, short, lived, reconciliation, with, her, estranged, husband, before, she, left, he, sent, her, the, manuscript, of, ae, fond, kiss, as, a, farewell, in, edinburgh, in, early, 1787, he, met, james, johnson, a, struggling, music, engraver, and, music, seller, with, a, love, of, old, scots, songs, and, a, determination, to, preserve, them, burns, shared, this, interest, and, became, an, enthusiastic, contributor, to, the, scots, musical, museum, the, first, volume, was, published, in, 1787, and, included, three, songs, by, burns, he, contributed, 40, songs, to, volume, two, and, he, ended, up, responsible, for, about, a, third, of, the, 600, songs, in, the, whole, collection, as, well, as, making, a, considerable, editorial, contribution, the, final, volume, was, published, in, 1803, on, his, return, from, edinburgh, in, february, 1788, he, resumed, his, relationship, with, jean, armour, and, they, married, in, march, 1788, he, took, out, a, lease, on, ellisland, farm, dumfriesshire, settling, there, in, june, he, also, took, up, a, training, position, as, an, exciseman, or, gauger, which, involved, long, rides, and, detailed, bookkeeping, he, was, appointed, to, duties, in, customs, and, excise, in, 1789, burns, chose, the, land, of, ellisland, a, few, miles, north, of, the, town, of, dumfries, from, patrick, miller, s, estate, at, dalswinton, where, he, had, a, new, farmhouse, and, byre, built, he, and, jean, moved, in, the, following, summer, 1789, to, the, new, farm, house, at, ellisland, in, november, 1790, he, had, written, his, masterpiece, the, narrative, poem, tam, o, shanter, the, ellisland, farm, beside, the, river, nith, now, holds, a, unique, collection, of, burns, s, books, artefacts, and, manuscripts, and, is, mostly, preserved, as, when, burns, and, his, young, family, lived, there, burns, gave, up, the, farm, in, 1791, to, move, to, dumfries, about, this, time, he, was, offered, and, declined, an, appointment, in, london, on, the, staff, of, the, star, newspaper, and, refused, to, become, a, candidate, for, a, newly, created, chair, of, agriculture, in, the, university, of,

immortality, chiefly, rests, on, these, volumes, which, placed, him, in, the, front, rank, of, lyric, poets, as, a, songwriter, he, provided, his, own, lyrics, sometimes, adapted, from, traditional, words, he, put, words, to, scottish, folk, melodies, and, airs, which, he, collected, and, composed, his, own, arrangements, of, the, music, including, modifying, tunes, or, recreating, melodies, on, the, basis, of, fragments, in, letters, he, explained, that, he, preferred, simplicity, relating, songs, to, spoken, language, which, should, be, sung, in, traditional, ways, the, original, instruments, would, be, fiddle, and, the, guitar, of, the, period, which, was, akin, to, a, cittern, but, the, transcription, of, songs, for, piano, has, resulted, in, them, usually, being, performed, in, classical, concert, or, music, hall, styles, at, the, 3, week, celtic, connections, festival, glasgow, each, january, burns, songs, are, often, performed, with, both, fiddle, and, guitar, thomson,

contributors, of, lyrics, included, burns, while, such, arrangements, had, wide, popular, appeal, beethoven, s, music, was, more, advanced, and, difficult, to, play, than, thomson, intended, burns, described, how, he, had, to, master, singing, the, tune, before, he, composed, the, words, my, way, is, i, consider, the, poetic, sentiment, correspondent, to, my, idea, of, the, musical, expression, then, chuse, my, theme, begin, one, stanza, when, that, is, composed, which, is, generally, the, most, difficult, part, of, the, business, i, walk, out, sit, down, now, and, then, look, out, for, objects, in, nature, around, me, that, are, in, unison, or, harmony, with, the, cogitations, of, my, fancy, and, workings, of, my, bosom, humming, every, now, and, then, the, air, with, the, verses, i, have, framed, when, i, feel, my, muse, beginning, to, jade, i, retire, to, the, solitary, fireside, of, my, study, and, there, commit, my, effusions, to, paper, swinging, at, intervals, on, the, hind, legs, of, my, elbow, chair, by, way, of, calling, forth, my, own, critical, strictures, as, my, pen, goes, burns, also, worked, to, collect, and, preserve, scottish, folk, songs, sometimes,

glasgow, magazine, he, was, also, a, radical, for, reform, and, wrote, poems, for, democracy, such, as, parcel, of, rogues, to, the, nation, and, the, rights, of, women, many, of, burns, s, most, famous, poems, are, songs, with, the, music, based, upon, older, traditional, songs, for, example, auld, lang, syne, is, set, to, the, traditional, tune, can, ye, labour, lea, a, red, red, rose, is,

and, american, revolutions, for, the, advocates, of, democratic, reform, and, votes, for, all, men, and, the, society, of, the, friends, of, the, people, which, advocated, parliamentary, reform, his,
