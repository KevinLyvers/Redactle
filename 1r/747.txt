william, of, ockham, or, occam, ofm, k, m, ok, m, latin, gulielmus, occamus, c, 1287, 10, april, 1347, was, an, english, franciscan, friar, scholastic, philosopher, apologist, and, catholic, theologian, who, is, believed, to, have, been, born, in, ockham, a, small, village, in, surrey, he, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, major, figures, of, medieval, thought, and, was, at, the, centre, of, the, major, intellectual, and, political, controversies, of, the, 14th, century, he, is, commonly, known, for, occam, s, razor, the, methodological, principle, that, bears, his, name, and, also, produced, significant, works, on, logic, physics, and, theology, william, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, commemoration, on, the, 10th, of, april, william, of, ockham, was, born, in, ockham, surrey, in, 1287, he, received, his, elementary, education, in, the, london, house, of, the, greyfriars, it, is, believed, that, he, then, studied, theology, at, the, university, of, oxford, from, 1309, to, 1321, but, while, he, completed, all, the, requirements, for, a, master, s, degree, in, theology, he, was, never, made, a, regent, master, because, of, this, he, acquired, the, honorific, title, venerabilis, inceptor, or, venerable, beginner, an, inceptor, was, a, student, formally, admitted, to, the, ranks, of, teachers, by, the, university, authorities, during, the, middle, ages, theologian, peter, lombard, s, sentences, 1150, had, become, a, standard, work, of, theology, and, many, ambitious, theological, scholars, wrote, commentaries, on, it, william, of, ockham, was, among, these, scholarly, commentators, however, william, s, commentary, was, not, well, received, by, his, colleagues, or, by, the, church, authorities, in, 1324, his, commentary, was, condemned, as, unorthodox, by, a, synod, of, bishops, and, he, was, ordered, to, avignon, france, to, defend, himself, before, a, papal, court, an, alternative, understanding, recently, proposed, by, george, knysh, suggests, that, he, was, initially, appointed, in, avignon, as, a, professor, of, philosophy, in, the, franciscan, school, and, that, his, disciplinary, difficulties, did, not, begin, until, 1327, it, is, generally, believed, that, these, charges, were, levied, by, oxford, chancellor, john, lutterell, the, franciscan, minister, general, michael, of, cesena, had, been, summoned, to, avignon, to, answer, charges, of, heresy, a, theological, commission, had, been, asked, to, review, his, commentary, on, the, sentences, and, it, was, during, this, that, william, of, ockham, found, himself, involved, in, a, different, debate, michael, of, cesena, had, asked, william, to, review, arguments, surrounding, apostolic, poverty, the, franciscans, believed, that, jesus, and, his, apostles, owned, no, property, either, individually, or, in, common, and, the, rule, of, saint, francis, commanded, members, of, the, order, to, follow, this, practice, this, brought, them, into, conflict, with, pope, john, xxii, because, of, the, pope, s, attack, on, the, rule, of, saint, francis, william, of, ockham, michael, of, cesena, and, other, leading, franciscans, fled, avignon, on, 26, may, 1328, and, eventually, took, refuge, in, the, court, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, louis, iv, of, bavaria, who, was, also, engaged, in, dispute, with, the, papacy, and, became, william, s, patron, after, studying, the, works, of, john, xxii, and, previous, papal, statements, william, agreed, with, the, minister, general, in, return, for, protection, and, patronage, william, wrote, treatises, that, argued, for, emperor, louis, to, have, supreme, control, over, church, and, state, in, the, holy, roman, empire, on, june, 6, 1328, william, was, officially, excommunicated, for, leaving, avignon, without, permission, and, william, argued, that, john, xxii, was, a, heretic, for, attacking, the, doctrine, of, apostolic, poverty, and, the, rule, of, saint, francis, which, had, been, endorsed, by, previous, popes, william, of, ockham, s, philosophy, was, never, officially, condemned, as, heretical, he, spent, much, of, the, remainder, of, his, life, writing, about, political, issues, including, the, relative, authority, and, rights, of, the, spiritual, and, temporal, powers, after, michael, of, cesena, s, death, in, 1342, william, became, the, leader, of, the, small, band, of, franciscan, dissidents, living, in, exile, with, louis, iv, william, of, ockham, died, prior, to, the, outbreak, of, the, plague, on, 9, april, 1347, in, scholasticism, william, of, ockham, advocated, reform, in, both, method, and, content, the, aim, of, which, was, simplification, william, incorporated, much, of, the, work, of, some, previous, theologians, especially, duns, scotus, from, duns, scotus, william, of, ockham, derived, his, view, of, divine, omnipotence, his, view, of, grace, and, justification, much, of, his, epistemology, and, ethical, convictions, however, he, also, reacted, to, and, against, scotus, in, the, areas, of, predestination, penance, his, understanding, of, universals, his, formal, distinction, ex, parte, rei, that, is, as, applied, to, created, things, and, his, view, of, parsimony, which, became, known, as, occam, s, razor, william, of, ockham, espoused, fideism, stating, that, only, faith, gives, us, access, to, theological, truths, the, ways, of, god, are, not, open, to, reason, for, god, has, freely, chosen, to, create, a, world, and, establish, a, way, of, salvation, within, it, apart, from, any, necessary, laws, that, human, logic, or, rationality, can, uncover, he, believed, that, science, was, a, matter, of, discovery, and, saw, god, as, the, only, ontological, necessity, his, importance, is, as, a, theologian, with, a, strongly, developed, interest, in, logical, method, and, whose, approach, was, critical, rather, than, system, building, william, of, ockham, was, a, pioneer, of, nominalism, and, some, consider, him, the, father, of, modern, epistemology, because, of, his, strongly, argued, position, that, only, individuals, exist, rather, than, supra, individual, universals, essences, or, forms, and, that, universals, are, the, products, of, abstraction, from, individuals, by, the, human, mind, and, have, no, extra, mental, existence, he, denied, the, real, existence, of, metaphysical, universals, and, advocated, the, reduction, of, ontology, william, of, ockham, is, sometimes, considered, an, advocate, of, conceptualism, rather, than, nominalism, for, whereas, nominalists, held, that, universals, were, merely, names, i, e, words, rather, than, extant, realities, conceptualists, held, that, they, were, mental, concepts, i, e, the, names, were, names, of, concepts, which, do, exist, although, only, in, the, mind, therefore, the, universal, concept, has, for, its, object, not, a, reality, existing, in, the, world, outside, us, but, an, internal, representation, which, is, a, product, of, the, understanding, itself, and, which, supposes, in, the, mind, the, things, to, which, the, mind, attributes, it, that, is, it, holds, for, the, time, being, the, place, of, the, things, which, it, represents, it, is, the, term, of, the, reflective, act, of, the, mind, hence, the, universal, is, not, a, mere, word, as, roscelin, taught, nor, a, sermo, as, peter, abelard, held, namely, the, word, as, used, in, the, sentence, but, the, mental, substitute, for, real, things, and, the, term, of, the, reflective, process, for, this, reason, william, has, sometimes, also, been, called, a, terminist, to, distinguish, him, from, a, nominalist, or, a, conceptualist, william, of, ockham, was, a, theological, voluntarist, who, believed, that, if, god, had, wanted, to, he, could, have, become, incarnate, as, a, donkey, or, an, ox, or, even, as, both, a, donkey, and, a, man, at, the, same, time, he, was, criticized, for, this, belief, by, his, fellow, theologians, and, philosophers, one, important, contribution, that, he, made, to, modern, science, and, modern, intellectual, culture, was, efficient, reasoning, with, the, principle, of, parsimony, in, explanation, and, theory, building, that, came, to, be, known, as, occam, s, razor, this, maxim, as, interpreted, by, bertrand, russell, states, that, if, one, can, explain, a, phenomenon, without, assuming, this, or, that, hypothetical, entity, there, is, no, ground, for, assuming, it, i, e, that, one, should, always, opt, for, an, explanation, in, terms, of, the, fewest, possible, causes, factors, or, variables, he, turned, this, into, a, concern, for, ontological, parsimony, the, principle, says, that, one, should, not, multiply, entities, beyond, necessity, entia, non, sunt, multiplicanda, sine, necessitate, although, this, well, known, formulation, of, the, principle, is, not, to, be, found, in, any, of, william, s, extant, writings, he, formulates, it, as, for, nothing, ought, to, be, posited, without, a, reason, given, unless, it, is, self, evident, literally, known, through, itself, or, known, by, experience, or, proved, by, the, authority, of, sacred, scripture, for, william, of, ockham, the, only, truly, necessary, entity, is, god, everything, else, is, contingent, he, thus, does, not, accept, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, rejects, the, distinction, between, essence, and, existence, and, opposes, the, thomistic, doctrine, of, active, and, passive, intellect, his, scepticism, to, which, his, ontological, parsimony, request, leads, appears, in, his, doctrine, that, human, reason, can, prove, neither, the, immortality, of, the, soul, nor, the, existence, unity, and, infinity, of, god, these, truths, he, teaches, are, known, to, us, by, revelation, alone, william, wrote, a, great, deal, on, natural, philosophy, including, a, long, commentary, on, aristotle, s, physics, according, to, the, principle, of, ontological, parsimony, he, holds, that, we, do, not, need, to, allow, entities, in, all, ten, of, aristotle, s, categories, we, thus, do, not, need, the, category, of, quantity, as, the, mathematical, entities, are, not, real, mathematics, must, be, applied, to, other, categories, such, as, the, categories, of, substance, or, qualities, thus, anticipating, modern, scientific, renaissance, while, violating, aristotelian, prohibition, of, metabasis, in, the, theory, of, knowledge, william, rejected, the, scholastic, theory, of, species, as, unnecessary, and, not, supported, by, experience, in, favour, of, a, theory, of, abstraction, this, was, an, important, development, in, late, medieval, epistemology, he, also, distinguished, between, intuitive, and, abstract, cognition, intuitive, cognition, depends, on, the, existence, or, non, existence, of, the, object, whereas, abstractive, cognition, abstracts, the, object, from, the, existence, predicate, interpreters, are, as, yet, undecided, about, the, roles, of, these, two, types, of, cognitive, activities, william, of, ockham, is, also, increasingly, being, recognized, as, an, important, contributor, to, the, development, of, western, constitutional, ideas, especially, those, of, government, with, limited, responsibility, he, was, one, of, the, first, medieval, authors, to, advocate, a, form, of, church, state, separation, and, was, important, for, the, early, development, of, the, notion, of, property, rights, his, political, ideas, are, regarded, as, natural, or, secular, holding, for, a, secular, absolutism, the, views, on, monarchical, accountability, espoused, in, his, dialogus, written, between, 1332, and, 1347, greatly, influenced, the, conciliar, movement, and, assisted, in, the, emergence, of, democratic, ideologies, william, argued, for, complete, separation, of, spiritual, rule, and, earthly, rule, he, thought, that, the, pope, and, churchmen, have, no, right, or, grounds, at, all, for, secular, rule, like, having, property, citing, 2, timothy, 2, 4, that, belongs, solely, to, earthly, rulers, who, may, also, accuse, the, pope, of, crimes, if, need, be, after, the, fall, he, believed, god, had, given, humanity, including, non, christians, two, powers, private, ownership, and, the, right, to, set, their, rulers, who, should, serve, the, interest, of, the, people, not, some, special, interests, thus, he, preceded, thomas, hobbes, in, formulating, social, contract, theory, along, with, earlier, scholars, william, of, ockham, said, that, the, franciscans, avoided, both, private, and, common, ownership, by, using, commodities, including, food, and, clothes, without, any, rights, with, mere, usus, facti, the, ownership, still, belonging, to, the, donor, of, the, item, or, to, the, pope, their, opponents, such, as, pope, john, xxii, wrote, that, use, without, any, ownership, cannot, be, justified, it, is, impossible, that, an, external, deed, could, be, just, if, the, person, has, no, right, to, do, it, thus, the, disputes, on, the, heresy, of, franciscans, led, william, of, ockham, and, others, to, formulate, some, fundamentals, of, economic, theory, and, the, theory, of, ownership, in, logic, william, of, ockham, wrote, down, in, words, the, formulae, that, would, later, be, called, de, morgan, s, laws, and, he, pondered, ternary, logic, that, is, a, logical, system, with, three, truth, values, a, concept, that, would, be, taken, up, again, in, the, mathematical, logic, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, his, contributions, to, semantics, especially, to, the, maturing, theory, of, supposition, are, still, studied, by, logicians, william, of, ockham, was, probably, the, first, logician, to, treat, empty, terms, in, aristotelian, syllogistic, effectively, he, devised, an, empty, term, semantics, that, exactly, fit, the, syllogistic, specifically, an, argument, is, valid, according, to, william, s, semantics, if, and, only, if, it, is, valid, according, to, prior, analytics, william, of, ockham, denied, papal, infallibility, and, often, went, into, conflict, with, the, pope, as, a, result, some, theologians, have, viewed, him, as, a, proto, protestant, however, despite, his, conflicts, with, the, papacy, he, did, not, renounce, the, roman, catholic, church, ockham, also, held, that, councils, of, the, church, were, fallible, he, held, that, any, individual, could, err, on, matters, of, faith, and, councils, being, composed, of, multiple, fallible, individuals, could, err, he, thus, foreshadowed, some, elements, of, luther, s, view, of, sola, scriptura, ockham, taught, the, separation, of, church, and, state, believing, that, the, pope, and, emperor, should, be, separate, ockham, advocated, for, voluntary, poverty, ockham, opposed, pope, john, xxii, on, the, question, of, the, beatific, vision, john, had, proposed, that, the, souls, of, christians, did, not, instantly, get, to, enjoy, the, vision, of, god, rather, such, vision, would, be, postponed, until, the, last, judgement, william, of, ockham, and, his, works, have, been, discussed, as, a, possible, influence, on, several, late, medieval, literary, figures, and, works, especially, geoffrey, chaucer, but, also, jean, molinet, the, gawain, poet, fran, ois, rabelais, john, skelton, julian, of, norwich, the, york, and, townely, plays, and, renaissance, romances, only, in, very, few, of, these, cases, is, it, possible, to, demonstrate, direct, links, to, william, of, ockham, or, his, texts, correspondences, between, ockhamist, and, nominalist, philosophy, theology, and, literary, texts, from, medieval, to, postmodern, times, have, been, discussed, within, the, scholarly, paradigm, of, literary, nominalism, erasmus, in, his, praise, of, folly, criticized, him, together, with, duns, scotus, as, fuelling, unnecessary, controversies, inside, the, church, the, standard, edition, of, the, philosophical, and, theological, works, is, william, of, ockham, opera, philosophica, et, theologica, gedeon, g, l, et, al, eds, 17, vols, st, bonaventure, new, york, the, franciscan, institute,
