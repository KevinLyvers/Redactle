awakening, of, the, capris, song, gaye, said, it, fell, from, the, heavens, and, hit, me, between, the, eyes, so, much, soul, so, much, hurt, i, related, to, the, story, to, the, way, that, no, one, except, the, lord, really, can, read, the, heart, of, lonely, kids, in, love, gaye, s, main, musical, influences, were, rudy, west, of, the, five, keys, clyde, mcphatter, ray, charles, and, little, willie, john, gaye, considered, frank, sinatra, a, major, influence, in, what, he, wanted, to, be, he, also, was, influenced, by, the, vocal, styles, of, billy, eckstine, and, nat, king, cole, as, his, motown, career, developed, gaye, took, inspiration, from, fellow, label, mates, such, as, david, ruffin, of, the, temptations, and, levi, stubbs, of, the, four, tops, whose, grittier, voices, led, to, gaye, and, his, producer, seeking, a, similar, sound, in, recordings, such, as, i, heard, it, through, the, grapevine, and, that, s, the, way, love, is, later, in, his, life, gaye, reflected, on, the, influence, of, ruffin, and, stubbs, stating, i, had, heard, something, in, their, voices, something, my, own, voice, lacked, he, further, explained, the, tempts, and, tops, music, made, me, remember, that, when, a, lot, of, women, listen, to, music, they, want, to, feel, the, power, of, a, real, man, gaye, had, a, four, octave, vocal, range, from, his, earlier, recordings, as, member, of, the, marquees, and, harvey, and, the, new, moonglows, and, in, his, first, several, recordings, with, motown, gaye, recorded, mainly, in, the, baritone, and, tenor, ranges, he, changed, his, tone, to, a, rasp, for, his, gospel, inspired, early, hits, such, as, stubborn, kind, of, fellow, and, hitch, hike, as, writer, eddie, holland, explained, he, was, the, only, singer, i, have, ever, heard, known, to, take, a, song, of, that, nature, that, was, so, far, removed, from, his, natural, voice, where, he, liked, singing, and, do, whatever, it, took, to, sell, that, song, in, songs, such, as, pride, and, joy, gaye, used, three, different, vocal, ranges, singing, in, his, baritone, range, at, the, beginning, bringing, a, lighter, tenor, in, the, verses, before, reaching, a, gospel, mode, in, the, chorus, holland, further, stated, of, gaye, s, voice, that, it, was, one, of, the, sweetest, and, prettiest, voices, you, ever, wanted, to, hear, and, while, he, noted, that, ballads, and, jazz, was, his, basic, soul, he, stated, gaye, had, the, ability, to, take, a, roughhouse, rock, and, roll, blues, r, b, any, kind, of, song, and, make, it, his, own, later, saying, that, gaye, was, the, most, versatile, vocalist, he, had, ever, worked, with, gaye, changed, his, vocal, style, in, the, late, 1960s, when, he, was, advised, to, use, a, sharper, raspy, voice, especially, in, norman, whitfield, s, recordings, gaye, initially, disliked, the, new, style, considering, it, out, of, his, range, but, said, he, was, into, being, produce, able, after, listening, to, david, ruffin, and, levi, stubbs, gaye, said, he, started, to, develop, what, he, called, his, tough, man, voice, saying, i, developed, a, growl, in, the, liner, notes, of, his, dvd, set, marvin, gaye, the, real, thing, in, performance, 1964, 1981, rob, bowman, said, that, by, the, early, 1970s, gaye, had, developed, three, distinct, voices, his, smooth, sweet, tenor, a, growling, rasp, and, an, unreal, falsetto, bowman, further, wrote, that, the, recording, of, the, what, s, going, on, single, was, the, first, single, to, use, all, three, as, marvin, developed, a, radical, approach, to, constructing, his, recordings, by, layering, a, series, of, contrapuntal, background, vocal, lines, on, different, tracks, each, one, conceived, and, sung, in, isolation, by, marvin, himself, bowman, found, that, gaye, s, multi, tracking, of, his, tenor, voice, and, other, vocal, styles, summon, up, what, might, be, termed, the, ancient, art, of, weaving, prior, to, recording, the, what, s, going, on, album, gaye, recorded, a, cover, of, the, song, abraham, martin, john, which, became, a, uk, hit, in, 1970, despite, some, political, music, and, socially, conscious, material, recorded, by, the, temptations, motown, artists, were, often, told, to, not, delve, into, political, and, social, commentary, for, fear, of, alienating, pop, audiences, early, in, his, career, gaye, was, affected, by, social, events, such, as, the, 1965, watts, riots, and, once, asked, himself, with, the, world, exploding, around, me, how, am, i, supposed, to, keep, singing, love, songs, when, gaye, called, gordy, in, the, bahamas, about, wanting, to, do, protest, music, gordy, told, him, marvin, don, t, be, ridiculous, that, s, taking, things, too, far, gaye, was, inspired, by, the, black, panther, party, and, supported, the, efforts, they, put, forth, such, as, giving, free, meals, to, poor, families, door, to, door, however, he, did, not, support, the, violent, tactics, the, panthers, used, to, fight, oppression, as, gaye, s, messages, in, many, of, his, political, songs, were, nonviolent, the, lyrics, and, music, of, what, s, going, on, discuss, and, illustrate, issues, during, the, 1960s, 1970s, such, as, racism, police, brutality, drug, abuse, environmental, issues, anti, war, and, black, power, issues, gaye, was, inspired, to, make, this, album, because, of, events, such, as, the, vietnam, war, the, 1967, race, riots, in, detroit, and, the, kent, state, shootings, as, well, as, the, assassinations, of, martin, luther, king, jr, and, robert, f, kennedy, once, gaye, presented, gordy, with, the, what, s, going, on, album, gordy, feared, gaye, was, risking, the, ruination, of, his, image, as, a, sex, symbol, following, the, album, s, success, gaye, tried, a, follow, up, album, you, re, the, man, the, title, track, only, produced, modest, success, however, and, gaye, and, motown, shelved, the, album, several, of, gaye, s, unreleased, songs, of, social, commentary, including, the, world, is, rated, x, would, be, issued, on, posthumous, compilation, albums, what, s, going, on, would, later, be, described, by, an, allmusic, writer, as, an, album, that, not, only, redefined, soul, music, as, a, creative, force, but, also, expanded, its, impact, as, an, agent, for, social, change, you, re, the, man, was, finally, released, on, march, 29, 2019, through, motown, universal, music, enterprises, and, universal, music, group, the, what, s, going, on, album, also, provided, another, first, in, both, motown, and, r, b, music, gaye, and, his, engineers, had, composed, the, album, in, a, song, cycle, segueing, previous, songs, into, other, songs, giving, the, album, a, more, cohesive, feel, as, opposed, to, r, b, albums, that, traditionally, included, filler, tracks, to, complete,

the, old, time, gospel, singer, and, became, an, influential, force, in, pop, music, further, in, the, article, gaye, was, also, credited, with, combining, the, soulful, directness, of, gospel, music, the, sweetness, of, soft, soul, and, pop, and, the, vocal, musicianship, of, a, jazz, singer, his, recordings, for, motown, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, shaped, that, label, s, signature, sound, his,
