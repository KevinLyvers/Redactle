menander, i, soter, ancient, greek, romanized, m, nandros, s, t, r, lit, menander, the, saviour, pali, milinda, sometimes, called, menander, the, great, was, a, greco, bactrian, and, later, indo, greek, king, reigned, c, 165, 155, 130, bc, who, administered, a, large, territory, in, the, northwestern, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, central, asia, menander, is, noted, for, having, become, a, patron, and, convert, to, greco, buddhism, and, he, is, widely, regarded, as, the, greatest, of, the, indo, greek, kings, menander, might, have, initially, been, a, king, of, bactria, after, conquering, the, punjab, as, far, as, taxila, he, established, an, empire, which, stretched, from, the, kabul, river, in, the, west, to, the, indus, river, in, the, east, and, from, the, swat, river, valley, in, the, north, to, arachosia, the, helmand, province, according, to, numismatist, joe, cribb, and, archaeologist, rachel, mairs, the, accounts, of, menander, s, kingdom, stretching, as, far, as, sialkot, is, hard, to, believe, as, there, is, no, numismatic, evidence, of, him, east, of, taxila, even, more, hard, is, to, believe, is, stretching, even, further, east, as, thought, earlier, by, historians, based, upon, indian, references, which, most, likely, are, referring, to, kushans, large, numbers, of, menander, s, coins, have, been, unearthed, attesting, to, both, the, flourishing, commerce, and, longevity, of, his, realm, menander, was, also, a, patron, of, buddhism, and, his, conversations, with, the, buddhist, sage, nagasena, are, recorded, in, the, important, buddhist, work, the, milinda, panha, the, questions, of, king, milinda, panha, meaning, question, in, pali, after, his, death, in, 130, bc, he, was, succeeded, by, his, wife, agathocleia, perhaps, the, daughter, of, agathocles, who, ruled, as, regent, for, his, son, strato, i, buddhist, tradition, relates, that, he, handed, over, his, kingdom, to, his, son, and, retired, from, the, world, but, plutarch, says, that, he, died, in, camp, while, on, a, military, campaign, and, that, his, remains, were, divided, equally, between, the, cities, to, be, enshrined, in, monuments, probably, stupas, across, his, realm, menander, was, born, into, a, greek, family, in, a, village, called, kalasi, adjacent, to, alexandria, of, the, caucasus, present, day, bagram, afghanistan, although, another, source, says, he, was, born, near, sagala, modern, sialkot, in, the, punjab, pakistan, his, territories, covered, bactria, modern, day, balkh, province, and, extended, to, india, modern, day, regions, of, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, and, greater, punjab, his, capital, is, supposed, to, have, been, sagala, a, prosperous, city, in, northern, punjab, believed, to, be, modern, sialkot, pakistan, the, greeks, who, caused, bactria, to, revolt, grew, so, powerful, on, account, of, the, fertility, of, the, country, that, they, became, masters, not, only, of, ariana, but, also, of, india, as, apollodorus, of, artemita, says, and, more, tribes, were, subdued, by, them, than, by, alexander, by, menander, in, particular, at, least, if, he, actually, crossed, the, hypanis, towards, the, east, and, advanced, as, far, as, the, ima, s, for, some, were, subdued, by, him, personally, and, others, by, demetrius, the, son, of, euthydemus, the, king, of, the, bactrians, and, they, took, possession, not, only, of, patalena, but, also, on, the, rest, of, the, coast, of, what, is, called, the, kingdom, of, saraostus, and, sigerdis, in, short, apollodorus, says, that, bactriana, is, the, ornament, of, ariana, as, a, whole, and, more, than, that, they, extended, their, empire, even, as, far, as, the, seres, and, the, phryni, accounts, describe, indo, greek, campaigns, to, mathura, panchala, saketa, and, potentially, pataliputra, the, sage, patanjali, around, 150, bc, describes, menander, campaigning, as, far, as, mathura, the, hathigumpha, inscription, inscribed, by, kharavela, the, king, of, kalinga, also, places, the, yavanas, or, indo, greeks, in, mathura, kharavela, states, to, have, forced, the, demoralized, yavana, army, to, retreat, back, to, mathura, then, in, the, eighth, year, kharavela, with, a, large, army, having, sacked, goradhagiri, causes, pressure, on, rajagaha, rajagriha, on, account, of, the, loud, report, of, this, act, of, valour, the, yavana, greek, king, retreated, to, mathura, having, extricated, his, demoralized, army, menander, may, have, campaigned, as, far, as, the, shunga, capital, pataliputra, resulting, in, a, conflict, the, religious, scripture, yuga, purana, which, describes, events, in, the, form, of, a, prophecy, states, after, having, conquered, saketa, the, country, of, the, panchala, and, the, mathuras, the, yavanas, greeks, wicked, and, valiant, will, reach, kusumadhvaja, the, thick, mud, fortifications, at, pataliputra, being, reached, all, the, provinces, will, be, in, disorder, without, a, doubt, ultimately, a, great, battle, will, follow, with, tree, like, engines, siege, engines, strabo, also, suggests, that, indo, greek, conquests, went, up, to, the, shunga, capital, pataliputra, in, northeastern, india, today, patna, those, who, came, after, alexander, went, to, the, ganges, and, pataliputra, the, events, and, results, of, these, campaigns, are, unknown, surviving, epigraphical, inscriptions, during, this, time, such, as, the, hathigumpha, inscription, states, that, kharavela, sacked, pataliputra, furthermore, numismatics, from, the, mitra, dynasty, are, concurrently, placed, in, mathura, during, the, time, of, menander, their, relationship, is, unclear, but, the, mithra, may, potentially, be, vassals, in, the, west, menander, seems, to, have, repelled, the, invasion, of, the, dynasty, of, greco, bactrian, usurper, eucratides, and, pushed, them, back, as, far, as, the, paropamisadae, thereby, consolidating, the, rule, of, the, indo, greek, kings, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, milinda, panha, gives, some, glimpses, of, his, military, methods, has, it, ever, happened, to, you, o, king, that, rival, kings, rose, up, against, you, as, enemies, and, opponents, yes, certainly, then, you, set, to, work, i, suppose, to, have, moats, dug, and, ramparts, thrown, up, and, watch, towers, erected, and, strongholds, built, and, stores, of, food, collected, not, at, all, all, that, had, been, prepared, beforehand, or, you, had, yourself, trained, in, the, management, of, war, elephants, and, in, horsemanship, and, in, the, use, of, the, war, chariot, and, in, archery, and, fencing, not, at, all, i, had, learnt, all, that, before, but, why, with, the, object, of, warding, off, future, danger, generous, findings, of, coins, testify, to, the, prosperity, and, extent, of, his, empire, with, finds, as, far, as, britain, the, finds, of, his, coins, are, the, most, numerous, and, the, most, widespread, of, all, the, indo, greek, kings, precise, dates, of, his, reign, as, well, as, his, origin, remain, elusive, however, guesses, among, historians, have, been, that, menander, was, either, a, nephew, or, a, former, general, of, the, greco, bactrian, king, demetrius, i, but, the, two, kings, are, now, thought, to, be, separated, by, at, least, thirty, years, menander, s, predecessor, in, punjab, seems, to, have, been, the, king, apollodotus, i, menander, s, empire, survived, him, in, a, fragmented, manner, until, the, last, greek, king, strato, ii, disappeared, around, 10, ad, the, 1st, 2nd, century, ad, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, further, testifies, to, the, reign, of, menander, and, the, influence, of, the, indo, greeks, in, india, to, the, present, day, ancient, drachmae, are, current, in, barygaza, coming, from, this, country, bearing, inscriptions, in, greek, letters, and, the, devices, of, those, who, reigned, after, alexander, apollodorus, and, menander, according, to, tradition, menander, embraced, the, buddhist, faith, as, described, in, the, milinda, panha, a, classical, pali, buddhist, text, on, the, discussions, between, milinda, and, the, buddhist, sage, n, gasena, he, is, described, as, constantly, accompanied, by, an, elite, guard, of, 500, greek, yavana, soldiers, and, two, of, his, counsellors, are, named, demetrius, and, antiochus, in, the, milinda, panha, menander, is, introduced, as, king, of, the, city, of, euthymedia, in, india, milinda, by, name, learned, eloquent, wise, and, able, and, a, faithful, observer, and, that, at, the, right, time, of, all, the, various, acts, of, devotion, and, ceremony, enjoined, by, his, own, sacred, hymns, concerning, things, past, present, and, to, come, many, were, the, arts, and, sciences, he, knew, holy, tradition, and, secular, law, the, s, nkhya, yoga, ny, ya, and, vaisheshika, systems, of, philosophy, arithmetic, music, medicine, the, four, vedas, the, pur, nas, and, the, itih, sas, astronomy, magic, causation, and, magic, spells, the, art, of, war, poetry, conveyancing, in, a, word, the, whole, nineteen, as, a, disputant, he, was, hard, to, equal, harder, still, to, overcome, the, acknowledged, superior, of, all, the, founders, of, the, various, schools, of, thought, and, as, in, wisdom, so, in, strength, of, body, swiftness, and, valour, there, was, found, none, equal, to, milinda, in, all, india, he, was, rich, too, mighty, in, wealth, and, prosperity, and, the, number, of, his, armed, hosts, knew, no, end, buddhist, tradition, relates, that, following, his, discussions, with, n, gasena, menander, adopted, the, buddhist, faith, may, the, venerable, n, gasena, accept, me, as, a, supporter, of, the, faith, as, a, true, convert, from, to, day, onwards, as, long, as, life, shall, last, he, then, handed, over, his, kingdom, to, his, son, and, retired, from, the, world, and, afterwards, taking, delight, in, the, wisdom, of, the, elder, he, handed, over, his, kingdom, to, his, son, and, abandoning, the, household, life, for, the, houseless, state, grew, great, in, insight, and, himself, attained, to, arahatship, there, is, however, little, besides, this, testament, to, indicate, that, menander, in, fact, abdicated, his, throne, in, favour, of, his, son, based, on, numismatic, evidence, william, tarn, believed, that, he, in, fact, died, leaving, his, wife, agathocleia, to, rule, as, a, regent, until, his, son, strato, could, rule, properly, in, his, stead, despite, the, success, of, his, reign, it, is, clear, that, after, his, death, his, loosely, hung, empire, splintered, into, a, variety, of, indo, greek, successor, kingdoms, of, various, sizes, and, stability, his, legacy, as, a, buddhist, arhat, reached, the, greco, roman, world, and, plutarch, writes, but, when, one, menander, who, had, reigned, graciously, over, the, bactrians, died, afterwards, in, the, camp, the, cities, indeed, by, common, consent, celebrated, his, funerals, but, coming, to, a, contest, about, his, relics, they, were, difficultly, at, last, brought, to, this, agreement, that, his, ashes, being, distributed, everyone, should, carry, away, an, equal, share, and, they, should, all, erect, monuments, to, him, the, above, seems, to, corroborate, the, claim, it, is, unlikely, that, menander, s, support, of, buddhism, was, a, pious, reconstruction, of, a, buddhist, legend, for, his, deification, by, later, traditions, resonates, with, macedonian, religious, trends, that, granted, divine, honours, to, monarchs, and, members, of, their, family, and, worshipped, them, like, alexander, as, gods, it, is, no, coincidence, that, similar, motifs, highlight, the, buddha, s, deification, and, his, funereal, rituals, are, commensurate, with, those, of, macedonian, kings, and, universal, monarchs, the, evidence, is, in, favour, of, the, conversion, of, king, menander, to, buddhism, which, is, neither, an, isolated, historical, incident, nor, an, invention, of, later, traditions, minadrasa, maharajasa, katiassa, divasa, 4, 4, 4, 11, pra, me, prati, ta, pranasame, sakamunisa, on, the, 14th, day, of, k, rttika, in, the, reign, of, mah, r, ja, minadra, in, the, year, the, corporeal, relic, of, sakyamuni, which, is, endowed, with, life, has, been, established, from, alasanda, the, city, of, the, yonas, came, the, thera, elder, yona, mahadhammarakkhita, with, thirty, thousand, bhikkhus, a, coin, of, menander, i, was, found, in, the, second, oldest, stratum, gst, 2, of, the, butkara, stupa, suggesting, a, period, of, additional, constructions, during, the, reign, of, menander, it, is, thought, that, menander, was, the, builder, of, the, second, oldest, layer, of, the, butkara, stupa, following, its, initial, construction, during, the, maurya, empire, these, elements, tend, to, indicate, the, importance, of, buddhism, within, greek, communities, in, northwestern, india, and, the, prominent, role, greek, buddhist, monks, played, in, them, probably, under, the, sponsorship, of, menander, menander, has, left, behind, an, immense, corpus, of, silver, and, bronze, coins, more, so, than, any, other, indo, greek, king, during, his, reign, the, fusion, between, indian, and, greek, coin, standards, reached, its, apogee, the, coins, feature, the, legend, ancient, greek, romanized, basileos, soteros, menandrou, kharoshthi, maharaja, tratarasa, menadrasa, these, alterations, were, possibly, an, adaption, on, menander, s, part, to, the, indian, coins, of, the, bactrian, eucratides, i, who, had, conquered, the, westernmost, parts, of, the, indo, greek, kingdom, and, are, interpreted, by, bopearachchi, as, an, indication, that, menander, recaptured, these, western, territories, after, the, death, of, eucratides, menander, was, the, first, indo, greek, ruler, to, introduce, the, representation, of, athena, alkidemos, athena, saviour, of, the, people, on, his, coins, probably, in, reference, to, a, similar, statue, of, athena, alkidemos, in, pella, capital, of, macedon, this, type, was, subsequently, used, by, most, of, the, later, indo, greek, kings, a, king, named, menander, with, the, epithet, dikaios, the, just, ruled, in, punjab, after, 100, bc, earlier, scholars, such, as, a, cunningham, and, w, w, tarn, believed, there, was, only, one, menander, and, assumed, that, the, king, had, changed, his, epithet, and, or, was, expelled, from, his, western, dominions, a, number, of, coincidences, led, them, to, this, assumption, however, modern, numismatists, such, as, bopearachchi, and, r, c, senior, have, shown, by, differences, in, coin, findings, style, and, monograms, that, there, were, two, distinct, rulers, the, second, menander, could, have, been, a, descendant, of, the, first, and, his, buddhist, symbols, may, have, been, a, means, of, alluding, to, his, ancestor, s, conversion, however, menander, i, struck, a, rare, bronze, series, with, a, buddhist, wheel, coin, 3, plutarch, reports, that, menander, died, in, camp, while, on, campaign, thereby, differing, with, the, version, of, the, milindapanha, plutarch, gives, menander, as, an, example, of, benevolent, rule, contrasting, him, with, disliked, tyrants, such, as, dionysius, and, goes, on, to, explain, that, his, subject, towns, fought, over, the, honour, of, his, burial, ultimately, sharing, his, ashes, among, them, and, placing, them, in, monuments, possibly, stupas, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, the, funerals, of, the, buddha, but, when, one, menander, who, had, reigned, graciously, over, the, bactrians, died, afterwards, in, the, camp, the, cities, indeed, by, common, consent, celebrated, his, funerals, but, coming, to, a, contest, about, his, relics, they, were, difficultly, at, last, brought, to, this, agreement, that, his, ashes, being, distributed, everyone, should, carry, away, an, equal, share, and, they, should, all, erect, monuments, to, him, despite, his, many, successes, menander, s, last, years, may, have, been, fraught, with, another, civil, war, this, time, against, zoilos, i, who, reigned, in, gandhara, this, is, indicated, by, the, fact, that, menander, probably, overstruck, a, coin, of, zoilos, the, milinda, panha, might, give, some, support, to, the, idea, that, menander, s, position, was, precarious, since, it, describes, him, as, being, somewhat, cornered, by, numerous, enemies, into, a, circumscribed, territory, after, their, long, discussion, nagasaka, asked, himself, though, king, milinda, is, pleased, he, gives, no, signs, of, being, pleased, menander, says, in, reply, as, a, lion, the, king, of, beasts, when, put, in, a, cage, though, it, were, of, gold, is, still, facing, outside, even, so, do, i, live, as, the, master, in, the, house, but, remain, facing, outside, but, if, i, were, to, go, forth, from, home, into, homelessness, i, would, not, live, long, so, many, are, my, enemies, menander, was, the, last, indo, greek, king, mentioned, by, ancient, historians, and, developments, after, his, death, are, therefore, difficult, to, trace, a, the, traditional, view, supported, by, w, w, tarn, and, bopearachchi, is, that, menander, was, succeeded, by, his, queen, agathoclea, who, acted, as, regent, to, their, infant, son, strato, i, until, he, became, an, adult, and, took, over, the, crown, strato, i, used, the, same, reverse, as, menander, i, athena, hurling, a, thunderbolt, and, also, the, title, soter, according, to, this, scenario, agathoclea, and, strato, i, only, managed, to, maintain, themselves, in, the, eastern, parts, of, the, kingdom, punjab, and, at, times, gandhara, paropamisadae, and, pushkalavati, were, taken, over, by, zoilos, i, perhaps, because, some, of, agathokleia, s, subjects, may, have, been, reluctant, to, accept, an, infant, king, with, a, queen, regent, b, on, the, other, hand, r, c, senior, and, other, numismatics, such, as, david, bivar, have, suggested, that, strato, i, ruled, several, decades, after, menander, they, point, out, that, strato, s, and, agathoclea, s, monograms, are, usually, different, from, menander, s, and, overstrikes, and, hoard, findings, also, associate, them, with, later, kings, in, this, scenario, menander, was, briefly, succeeded, by, his, son, thrason, of, whom, a, single, coin, is, known, after, thrason, was, murdered, competing, kings, such, as, zoilos, i, or, lysias, may, have, taken, over, menander, s, kingdom, menander, s, dynasty, was, thus, dethroned, and, did, not, return, to, power, until, later, though, his, relative, nicias, may, have, ruled, a, small, principality, in, the, kabul, valley, after, the, reign, of, menander, i, strato, i, and, several, subsequent, indo, greek, rulers, such, as, amyntas, nicias, peucolaus, hermaeus, and, hippostratus, depicted, themselves, or, their, greek, deities, forming, with, the, right, hand, a, symbolic, gesture, identical, to, the, buddhist, vitarka, mudra, thumb, and, index, joined, together, with, other, fingers, extended, which, in, buddhism, signifies, the, transmission, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, at, the, same, time, right, after, the, death, of, menander, several, indo, greek, rulers, also, started, to, adopt, on, their, coins, the, pali, title, of, dharmikasa, meaning, follower, of, the, dharma, the, title, of, the, great, indian, buddhist, king, ashoka, was, dharmaraja, king, of, the, dharma, this, usage, was, adopted, by, strato, i, zoilos, i, heliocles, ii, theophilus, peucolaus, and, archebius, altogether, the, conversion, of, menander, to, buddhism, suggested, by, the, milinda, panha, seems, to, have, triggered, the, use, of, buddhist, symbolism, in, one, form, or, another, on, the, coinage, of, close, to, half, of, the, kings, who, succeeded, him, especially, all, the, kings, after, menander, who, are, recorded, to, have, ruled, in, gandhara, apart, from, the, little, known, demetrius, iii, display, buddhist, symbolism, in, one, form, or, another, both, because, of, his, conversion, and, because, of, his, unequaled, territorial, expansion, menander, may, have, contributed, to, the, expansion, of, buddhism, in, central, asia, although, the, spread, of, buddhism, to, central, asia, and, northern, asia, is, usually, associated, with, the, kushans, a, century, or, two, later, there, is, a, possibility, that, it, may, have, been, introduced, in, those, areas, from, gandhara, even, earlier, during, the, time, of, demetrius, and, menander, puri, buddhism, in, central, asia, a, frieze, in, sanchi, executed, during, or, soon, after, the, reign, of, menander, depicts, buddhist, devotees, in, greek, attire, the, men, are, depicted, with, short, curly, hair, often, held, together, with, a, headband, of, the, type, commonly, seen, on, greek, coins, the, clothing, too, is, greek, complete, with, tunics, capes, and, sandals, the, musical, instruments, are, also, quite, characteristic, such, as, the, double, flute, called, aulos, also, visible, are, carnyx, like, horns, they, are, all, celebrating, at, the, entrance, of, the, stupa, these, men, would, probably, be, nearby, indo, greeks, from, northwest, india, visiting, the, stupa, the, anthropomorphic, representation, of, the, buddha, is, absent, from, indo, greek, coinage, suggesting, that, the, indo, greek, kings, may, have, respected, the, indian, an, iconic, rule, for, depictions, of, the, buddha, limiting, themselves, to, symbolic, representation, only, consistently, with, this, perspective, the, actual, depiction, of, the, buddha, would, be, a, later, phenomenon, usually, dated, to, the, 1st, century, emerging, from, the, sponsorship, of, the, syncretic, kushan, empire, and, executed, by, greek, and, later, indian, and, possibly, roman, artists, datation, of, greco, buddhist, statues, is, generally, uncertain, but, they, are, at, least, firmly, established, from, the, 1st, century, another, possibility, is, that, just, as, the, indo, greeks, routinely, represented, philosophers, in, statues, but, certainly, not, on, coins, in, antiquity, the, indo, greek, may, have, initiated, anthropomorphic, representations, of, the, buddha, in, statuary, only, possibly, as, soon, as, the, 2nd, 1st, century, bc, as, advocated, by, foucher, and, suggested, by, chinese, murals, depicting, emperor, wu, of, han, worshipping, buddha, statues, brought, from, central, asia, in, 120, bc, see, picture, an, indo, chinese, tradition, also, explains, that, nagasena, also, known, as, menander, s, buddhist, teacher, created, in, 43, bc, in, the, city, of, pataliputra, a, statue, of, the, buddha, the, emerald, buddha, which, was, later, brought, to, thailand, stylistically, indo, greek, coins, generally, display, a, very, high, level, of, hellenistic, artistic, realism, which, declined, drastically, around, 50, bc, with, the, invasions, of, the, indo, scythians, yuezhi, and, indo, parthians, the, first, known, statues, of, the, buddha, are, also, very, realistic, and, hellenistic, in, style, and, are, more, consistent, with, the, pre, 50, bc, artistic, level, seen, on, coins, this, would, tend, to, suggest, that, the, first, statues, were, created, between, 130, bc, death, of, menander, and, 50, bc, precisely, at, the, time, when, buddhist, symbolism, appeared, on, indo, greek, coinage, from, that, time, menander, and, his, successors, may, have, been, the, key, propagators, of, buddhist, ideas, and, representations, the, spread, of, gandhari, buddhism, may, have, been, stimulated, by, menander, s, royal, patronage, as, may, have, the, development, and, spread, of, gandharan, sculpture, which, seems, to, have, accompanied, it, mcevilley, the, shape, of, ancient, thought, p, 378, the, milind, college, in, the, city, of, aurangabad, india, is, named, after, king, menander, i, using, the, pali, translation, of, his, name, milind, the, college, was, founded, in, part, by, bhimrao, ramji, ambedkar, an, indian, leader, of, the, dalit, buddhist, movement, and, writer, to, the, constitution, of, the, republic, of, india, in, classical, antiquity, from, at, least, the, 1st, century, the, menander, mons, or, mountains, of, menander, came, to, designate, the, mountain, chain, at, the, extreme, east, of, the, indian, subcontinent, today, s, naga, hills, and, arakan, as, indicated, in, the, ptolemy, world, map, of, the, 1st, century, geographer, ptolemy
