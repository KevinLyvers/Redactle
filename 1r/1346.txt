federico, finchelstein, writes, if, the, question, is, asked, if, per, n, was, a, fascist, the, answer, is, no, but, did, fascism, play, an, important, role, in, the, ideological, genesis, of, peronism, although, fascism, was, a, central, genealogy, of, peronism, per, n, s, coming, to, power, signaled, a, break, from, diverse, traditional, precedents, including, fascist, nacionalismo, however, the, ideological, continuities, between, argentine, fascism, and, italian, fascism, are, notable, in, per, n, s, military, junta, between, 1943, and, 1946, and, the, first, peronist, regime, 1946, 1955, carlos, fayt, states, that, peronism, was, just, an, argentine, implementation, of, italian, fascism, paul, m, hayes, similarly, concludes, that, the, peronist, movement, produced, a, form, of, fascism, that, was, distinctively, latin, american, instead, felipe, pigna, believes, that, no, researcher, who, has, deeply, studied, per, n, should, consider, him, a, fascist, pigna, argues, that, per, n, was, only, a, pragmatist, who, took, useful, elements, from, all, modern, ideologies, of, the, time, this, included, not, only, fascism, but, also, the, new, deal, policies, of, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, to, pigna, per, n, was, neither, fascist, nor, anti, fascist, but, simply, a, realist, the, active, intervention, of, the, working, class, in, politics, as, he, saw, in, those, countries, was, a, definitive, phenomenon, however, whether, peronism, was, a, fascist, movement, or, one, heavily, influenced, by, fascism, was, disputed, by, other, scholars, such, as, historian, federico, finchelstein, philosopher, donald, c, hodges, and, historian, daniel, james, hodges, remarked, that, it, is, a, cheap, academic, trick, to, lump, together, fascism, and, peronism, per, n, embraced, the, fascist, concept, of, the, state, as, the, juridical, instrument, that, can, only, function, within, and, serve, the, nation, but, rejected, the, organic, notions, of, the, state, assuming, the, dominating, role, by, organizing, the, nation, per, n, also, prided, himself, in, his, doctrinal, flexibility, and, elasticity, and, agreed, with, national, syndicalism, of, primo, de, rivera, in, principle, although, he, ultimately, pursued, a, different, political, path, hodges, argues, that, in, view, of, both, its, gradualism, and, its, concern, for, striking, a, balance, between, extremes, justicialism, has, more, in, common, with, the, american, new, deal, than, with, either, italian, fascism, or, german, national, socialism, daniel, james, believes, that, the, neo, corporatism, of, peronism, cannot, be, explained, by, any, allegiance, to, fascist, ideas, arguing, that, per, n, took, his, ideas, principally, from, social, catholic, communitarian, ideologues, rather, than, from, any, pre, 1955, fascistic, theory, as, a, response, to, carlos, fayt, who, characterized, per, nism, as, fascist, james, p, brennan, wrote, a, close, study, of, peronist, ideology, however, shows, that, the, differences, between, it, and, fascism, are, greater, than, their, few, similarities, the, central, components, of, justicialismo, that, is, of, peronist, ideology, have, roots, in, the, social, christianism, and, national, populism, of, the, forja, the, yrigoyenista, the, nationalist, youth, wing, of, the, radical, party, in, the, 1930s, and, in, syndicalism, moreover, this, synthesis, proved, to, be, more, resilient, over, time, than, many, had, assumed, in, peronism, s, formative, stage, the, irrational, vitalisme, life, philosophy, and, social, darwinism, of, fascism, had, minimal, and, no, influence, respectively, with, regard, to, italian, corporatism, which, ended, up, replacing, the, unions, and, democratic, elections, it, cannot, be, seriously, compared, with, the, syndicalist, element, in, peronism, peronism, s, presumedly, expansionist, goals, likewise, are, nowhere, in, evidence, and, sebreli, s, thesis, does, not, stand, up, to, the, slightest, analysis, the, only, similarity, that, can, be, acknowledged, is, the, particular, importance, both, ideologies, granted, to, the, concept, of, the, leader, whereas, italian, fascism, and, german, nazism, destroyed, the, universal, suffrage, that, had, existed, in, those, countries, peronism, on, the, other, hand, put, an, end, to, the, systematic, electoral, fraud, that, had, been, practiced, in, argentina, between, 1932, and, 1943, there, was, no, militarization, of, society, nor, was, public, spending, directed, toward, a, massive, arms, buildup, economic, policy, was, dirigiste, but, if, state, planning, is, an, indicator, of, fascism, one, would, have, to, conclude, that, mexico, under, cardenas, and, great, britain, under, the, labour, governments, the, peronist, governments, of, 1946, 1955, and, 1973, 1976, directed, their, efforts, toward, distributive, and, industrializing, policies, according, to, pablo, bradbury, while, there, was, a, great, divergence, between, formal, peronist, ideology, and, the, wider, peronist, movement, the, ideology, of, per, n, was, not, fascist, bradbury, argues, that, nationalism, of, peronism, was, not, rooted, in, a, sense, of, expansion, or, imperialist, greatness, but, was, left, wing, nationalism, that, found, its, most, prominent, expressions, in, anti, imperialism, whether, against, british, economic, dominance, or, us, political, interference, he, also, remarked, that, peronism, originated, in, a, military, dictatorship, but, established, a, populist, authoritarian, democracy, the, democratizing, movement, within, peronism, was, significant, as, it, empowered, previously, marginalized, groups, peronism, introduced, universal, suffrage, and, reshaped, the, definition, of, argentinian, citizenship, and, national, identity, bradbury, also, points, to, the, racist, rhetoric, of, middle, class, and, upper, class, opponents, of, peronism, who, called, peronists, cabecitas, negras, little, black, heads, portraying, the, peronist, masses, as, prone, to, criminality, unsophisticated, dark, skinned, and, of, immigrant, background, michael, goebel, likewise, points, to, the, inclusive, character, of, peronism, that, conflicted, with, the, exclusive, nature, of, fascism, non, spanish, surnames, were, far, more, prevalent, amongst, the, peronist, leadership, than, among, any, other, political, movement, in, argentina, and, even, in, the, more, marginal, provinces, peronist, politicians, often, had, rather, recent, immigrant, origins, cas, mudde, stated, that, it, is, not, an, exaggeration, to, state, that, populism, in, general, propelled, democracy, forward, both, by, encouraging, democratic, behavior, and, by, enrolling, lower, class, groups, and, their, quest, for, social, justice, in, political, life, in, 1938, per, n, was, sent, on, a, diplomatic, mission, to, europe, during, this, time, he, became, enamoured, of, the, italian, fascist, model, per, n, s, admiration, for, benito, mussolini, is, well, documented, he, credited, both, italian, fascism, and, german, national, socialism, for, creating, a, command, economy, that, harmonized, the, interests, of, workers, and, his, exact, words, in, that, respect, were, as, follows, from, germany, i, went, back, to, italy, and, studied, the, matter, my, knowledge, of, italian, enabled, me, i, would, say, to, penetrate, deeply, into, the, foundations, of, the, system, and, that, is, how, i, discovered, something, which, from, that, social, point, of, view, was, very, interesting, to, me, italian, fascism, brought, the, popular, organisations, into, effective, participation, in, national, life, from, which, the, people, had, always, been, excluded, until, mussolini, s, rise, to, power, the, nation, was, on, one, side, and, the, worker, on, the, other, and, the, latter, had, no, part, in, it, i, discovered, the, resurgence, of, the, corporations, and, studied, them, in, depth, however, per, n, also, cautioned, that, only, some, elements, of, european, fascism, can, be, praised, as, the, italian, and, german, regimes, otherwise, led, to, administrative, centralization, carried, to,
