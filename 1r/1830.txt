athletics, team, s, manager, jack, crump, opined, that, she, was, too, old, to, make, the, grade, many, in, the, netherlands, were, concerned, for, the, welfare, of, the, family, saying, that, she,

but, she, was, more, concerned, with, her, next, event, the, 80, m, hurdles, her, chief, opponent, was, maureen, gardner, also, coached, by, blankers, koen, s, husband, and, who, had, equalled, blankers, koen, s, world, record, prior, to, the, games, and, would, be, running, for, her, home, crowd, both, athletes, made, the, final, in, which, blankers, koen, got, off, to, a, bad, start, she, would, later, claim, she, thought, there, had, been, a, false, start, she, picked, up, the, pace, quickly, but, was, unable, to, shake, off, gardner, who, kept, close, until, the, finish, line, and, the, two, finished, almost, simultaneously, when, the, british, national, anthem, was, played, the, crowd, in, wembley, stadium, cheered, and, blankers, koen, briefly, thought, she, had, been, beaten, however, the, anthem, was, played, in, honour, of, the, british, royal, family, which, entered, the, stadium, at, that, time, examination, of, the, finish, photo, clearly, showed, that, not, gardner, but, blankers, koen, had, won, although, both, received, the, same, time, 11, 2, seconds, in, spite, of, her, successes, blankers, koen, nearly, failed, to, start, in, the, semi, finals, of, the, 200,
