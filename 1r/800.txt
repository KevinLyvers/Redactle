edward, gibbon, frs, b, n, 8, may, 1737, 16, january, 1794, was, an, english, essayist, historian, and, politician, his, most, important, work, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, published, in, six, volumes, between, 1776, and, 1789, is, known, for, the, quality, and, irony, of, its, prose, its, use, of, primary, sources, and, its, polemical, criticism, of, organized, religion, edward, gibbon, was, born, in, 1737, the, son, of, edward, and, judith, gibbon, at, lime, grove, in, the, town, of, putney, surrey, he, had, five, brothers, and, one, sister, all, of, whom, died, in, infancy, his, grandfather, also, named, edward, had, lost, his, assets, as, a, result, of, the, south, sea, bubble, stock, market, collapse, in, 1720, but, eventually, regained, much, of, his, wealth, gibbon, s, father, thus, inherited, a, substantial, estate, his, paternal, grandmother, catherine, acton, was, granddaughter, of, sir, walter, acton, 2nd, baronet, as, a, youth, gibbon, s, health, was, under, constant, threat, he, described, himself, as, a, puny, child, neglected, by, my, mother, starved, by, my, nurse, at, age, nine, he, was, sent, to, dr, woddeson, s, school, at, kingston, upon, thames, now, kingston, grammar, school, shortly, after, which, his, mother, died, he, then, took, up, residence, in, the, westminster, school, boarding, house, owned, by, his, adored, aunt, kitty, catherine, porten, soon, after, she, died, in, 1786, he, remembered, her, as, rescuing, him, from, his, mother, s, disdain, and, imparting, the, first, rudiments, of, knowledge, the, first, exercise, of, reason, and, a, taste, for, books, which, is, still, the, pleasure, and, glory, of, my, life, from, 1747, gibbon, spent, time, at, the, family, home, in, buriton, by, 1751, gibbon, s, reading, was, already, extensive, and, pointed, toward, his, future, pursuits, laurence, echard, s, roman, history, 1713, william, howel, l, s, an, institution, of, general, history, 1680, 85, and, several, of, the, 65, volumes, of, the, acclaimed, universal, history, from, the, earliest, account, of, time, 1747, 1768, following, a, stay, at, bath, in, 1752, to, improve, his, health, at, the, age, of, 15, gibbon, was, sent, by, his, father, to, magdalen, college, oxford, where, he, was, enrolled, as, a, gentleman, commoner, he, was, ill, suited, however, to, the, college, atmosphere, and, later, rued, his, 14, months, there, as, the, most, idle, and, unprofitable, of, his, life, because, he, says, so, in, his, autobiography, it, used, to, be, thought, that, a, penchant, from, his, aunt, for, theological, controversy, bloomed, under, the, influence, of, the, deist, or, rationalist, theologian, conyers, middleton, 1683, 1750, the, author, of, free, inquiry, into, the, miraculous, powers, 1749, in, that, tract, middleton, denied, the, validity, of, such, powers, gibbon, promptly, objected, or, so, the, argument, used, to, run, the, product, of, that, disagreement, with, some, assistance, from, the, work, of, catholic, bishop, jacques, b, nigne, bossuet, 1627, 1704, and, that, of, the, elizabethan, jesuit, robert, parsons, 1546, 1610, yielded, the, most, memorable, event, of, his, time, at, oxford, his, conversion, to, roman, catholicism, on, 8, june, 1753, he, was, further, corrupted, by, the, free, thinking, deism, of, the, playwright, and, poet, david, mallet, and, finally, gibbon, s, father, already, in, despair, had, had, enough, david, womersley, has, shown, however, that, gibbon, s, claim, to, having, been, converted, by, a, reading, of, middleton, is, very, unlikely, and, was, introduced, only, into, the, final, draft, of, the, memoirs, in, 1792, 93, within, weeks, of, his, conversion, he, was, removed, from, oxford, and, sent, to, live, under, the, care, and, tutelage, of, daniel, pavillard, reformed, pastor, of, lausanne, switzerland, there, he, made, one, of, his, life, s, two, great, friendships, that, of, jacques, georges, deyverdun, the, french, language, translator, of, goethe, s, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, and, that, of, john, baker, holroyd, later, lord, sheffield, just, a, year, and, a, half, later, after, his, father, threatened, to, disinherit, him, on, christmas, day, 1754, he, reconverted, to, protestantism, the, various, articles, of, the, romish, creed, he, wrote, disappeared, like, a, dream, he, also, met, the, one, romance, in, his, life, the, daughter, of, the, pastor, of, crassy, a, young, woman, named, suzanne, curchod, who, was, later, to, become, the, wife, of, louis, xvi, s, finance, minister, jacques, necker, and, the, mother, of, madame, de, sta, l, the, two, developed, a, warm, affinity, gibbon, proceeded, to, propose, marriage, but, ultimately, this, was, out, of, the, question, blocked, both, by, his, father, s, staunch, disapproval, and, curchod, s, equally, staunch, reluctance, to, leave, switzerland, gibbon, returned, to, england, in, august, 1758, to, face, his, father, no, refusal, of, the, elder, s, wishes, could, be, allowed, gibbon, put, it, this, way, i, sighed, as, a, lover, i, obeyed, as, a, son, he, proceeded, to, cut, off, all, contact, with, curchod, even, as, she, vowed, to, wait, for, him, their, final, emotional, break, apparently, came, at, ferney, france, in, early, 1764, though, they, did, see, each, other, at, least, one, more, time, a, year, later, upon, his, return, to, england, gibbon, published, his, first, book, essai, sur, l, tude, de, la, litt, rature, in, 1761, which, produced, an, initial, taste, of, celebrity, and, distinguished, him, in, paris, at, least, as, a, man, of, letters, from, 1759, to, 1770, gibbon, served, on, active, duty, and, in, reserve, with, the, south, hampshire, militia, his, deactivation, in, december, 1762, coinciding, with, the, militia, s, dispersal, at, the, end, of, the, seven, years, war, the, following, year, he, returned, via, paris, to, lausanne, where, he, made, the, acquaintance, of, a, prudent, worthy, young, man, william, guise, on, 18, april, 1764, he, and, guise, set, off, for, italy, crossed, the, alps, and, after, spending, the, summer, in, florence, arrived, in, rome, via, lucca, pisa, livorno, and, siena, in, early, october, in, his, autobiography, gibbon, vividly, records, his, rapture, when, he, finally, neared, the, great, object, of, pilgrimage, at, the, distance, of, twenty, five, years, i, can, neither, forget, nor, express, the, strong, emotions, which, agitated, my, mind, as, i, first, approached, and, entered, the, eternal, city, after, a, sleepless, night, i, trod, with, a, lofty, step, the, ruins, of, the, forum, each, memorable, spot, where, romulus, stood, or, tully, spoke, or, caesar, fell, was, at, once, present, to, my, eye, and, several, days, of, intoxication, were, lost, or, enjoyed, before, i, could, descend, to, a, cool, and, minute, investigation, here, gibbon, first, conceived, the, idea, of, composing, a, history, of, the, city, later, extended, to, the, entire, empire, a, moment, he, described, later, as, his, capitoline, vision, it, was, at, rome, on, the, fifteenth, of, october, 1764, as, i, sat, musing, amidst, the, ruins, of, the, capitol, while, the, barefooted, fryars, were, singing, vespers, in, the, temple, of, jupiter, that, the, idea, of, writing, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, city, first, started, to, my, mind, womersley, oxford, dictionary, of, national, biography, p, 12, notes, the, existence, of, good, reasons, to, doubt, the, statement, s, accuracy, elaborating, pocock, classical, history, 2, refers, to, it, as, a, likely, creation, of, memory, or, a, literary, invention, given, that, gibbon, in, his, autobiography, claimed, that, his, journal, dated, the, reminiscence, to, 15, october, when, in, fact, the, journal, gives, no, date, in, june, 1765, gibbon, returned, to, his, father, s, house, remaining, there, until, the, latter, s, death, in, 1770, these, five, years, were, considered, by, gibbon, as, the, worst, of, his, life, but, he, tried, to, remain, busy, by, making, early, attempts, at, full, histories, his, first, historical, narrative, known, as, the, history, of, switzerland, representing, gibbon, s, love, for, switzerland, was, never, finished, nor, published, even, under, the, guidance, of, deyverdun, his, german, translator, gibbon, became, too, self, critical, and, completely, abandoned, the, project, after, writing, only, 60, pages, of, text, soon, after, abandoning, his, history, of, switzerland, gibbon, made, another, attempt, towards, completing, a, full, history, his, second, work, memoires, litteraires, de, la, grande, bretagne, was, a, two, volume, set, describing, the, literary, and, social, conditions, of, england, at, the, time, such, as, lord, lyttelton, s, history, of, henry, ii, and, nathaniel, lardner, s, the, credibility, of, the, gospel, history, gibbon, s, memoires, litteraires, failed, to, gain, any, notoriety, and, was, considered, a, flop, by, fellow, historians, and, literary, scholars, after, he, tended, to, his, father, s, estate, which, was, in, poor, condition, enough, remained, for, gibbon, to, settle, fashionably, in, london, at, 7, bentinck, street, free, of, financial, concern, by, february, 1773, he, was, writing, in, earnest, but, not, without, the, occasional, self, imposed, distraction, he, took, to, london, society, quite, easily, joined, the, better, social, clubs, including, dr, johnson, s, literary, club, and, looked, in, from, time, to, time, on, his, friend, holroyd, in, sussex, he, succeeded, oliver, goldsmith, at, the, royal, academy, as, professor, in, ancient, history, an, honorary, but, prestigious, position, in, late, 1774, he, was, initiated, as, a, freemason, of, the, premier, grand, lodge, of, england, he, was, also, perhaps, least, productively, in, that, same, year, returned, to, the, house, of, commons, for, liskeard, cornwall, through, the, intervention, of, his, relative, and, patron, edward, eliot, he, became, the, archetypal, back, bencher, benignly, mute, and, indifferent, his, support, of, the, whig, ministry, invariably, automatic, gibbon, lost, the, liskeard, seat, in, 1780, when, eliot, joined, the, opposition, taking, with, him, the, electors, of, leskeard, are, commonly, of, the, same, opinion, as, mr, el, iot, murray, p, 322, the, following, year, owing, to, the, good, grace, of, prime, minister, lord, north, he, was, again, returned, to, parliament, this, time, for, lymington, on, a, by, election, in, a, distant, age, and, climate, the, tragic, scene, of, the, death, of, hosein, will, awaken, the, sympathy, of, the, coldest, reader, edward, gibbon, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, after, several, rewrites, with, gibbon, often, tempted, to, throw, away, the, labours, of, seven, years, the, first, volume, of, what, was, to, become, his, life, s, major, achievement, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, was, published, on, 17, february, 1776, through, 1777, the, reading, public, eagerly, consumed, three, editions, for, which, gibbon, was, rewarded, handsomely, two, thirds, of, the, profits, amounting, to, approximately, 1, 000, volumes, ii, and, iii, appeared, on, 1, march, 1781, eventually, rising, to, a, level, with, the, previous, volume, in, general, esteem, volume, iv, was, finished, in, june, 1784, the, final, two, were, completed, during, a, second, lausanne, sojourn, september, 1783, to, august, 1787, where, gibbon, reunited, with, his, friend, deyverdun, in, leisurely, comfort, by, early, 1787, he, was, straining, for, the, goal, and, with, great, relief, the, project, was, finished, in, june, gibbon, later, wrote, it, was, on, the, day, or, rather, the, night, of, 27, june, 1787, between, the, hours, of, eleven, and, twelve, that, i, wrote, the, last, lines, of, the, last, page, in, a, summer, house, in, my, garden, i, will, not, dissemble, the, first, emotions, of, joy, on, the, recovery, of, my, freedom, and, perhaps, the, establishment, of, my, fame, but, my, pride, was, soon, humbled, and, a, sober, melancholy, was, spread, over, my, mind, by, the, idea, that, i, had, taken, my, everlasting, leave, of, an, old, and, agreeable, companion, and, that, whatsoever, might, be, the, future, fate, of, my, history, the, life, of, the, historian, must, be, short, and, precarious, volumes, iv, v, and, vi, finally, reached, the, press, in, may, 1788, their, publication, having, been, delayed, since, march, so, it, could, coincide, with, a, dinner, party, celebrating, gibbon, s, 51st, birthday, the, 8th, mounting, a, bandwagon, of, praise, for, the, later, volumes, were, such, contemporary, luminaries, as, adam, smith, william, robertson, adam, ferguson, lord, camden, and, horace, walpole, adam, smith, told, gibbon, that, by, the, universal, assent, of, every, man, of, taste, and, learning, whom, i, either, know, or, correspond, with, it, sets, you, at, the, very, head, of, the, whole, literary, tribe, at, present, existing, in, europe, in, november, 1788, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, the, main, proposer, being, his, good, friend, lord, sheffield, in, 1783, gibbon, had, been, intrigued, by, the, cleverness, of, sheffield, s, 12, year, old, eldest, daughter, maria, and, he, proposed, to, teach, her, himself, over, the, following, years, he, continued, creating, a, girl, of, sixteen, who, was, both, well, educated, confident, and, determined, to, choose, her, own, husband, gibbon, described, her, as, a, mixture, of, just, observation, and, lively, imagery, the, strong, sense, of, a, man, expressed, with, the, easy, elegance, of, a, female, the, years, following, gibbon, s, completion, of, the, history, were, filled, largely, with, sorrow, and, increasing, physical, discomfort, he, had, returned, to, london, in, late, 1787, to, oversee, the, publication, process, alongside, lord, sheffield, with, that, accomplished, in, 1789, it, was, back, to, lausanne, only, to, learn, of, and, be, deeply, affected, by, the, death, of, deyverdun, who, had, willed, gibbon, his, home, la, grotte, he, resided, there, with, little, commotion, took, in, the, local, society, received, a, visit, from, sheffield, in, 1791, and, shared, the, common, abhorrence, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1793, word, came, of, lady, sheffield, s, death, gibbon, immediately, left, lausanne, and, set, sail, to, comfort, a, grieving, but, composed, sheffield, his, health, began, to, fail, critically, in, december, and, at, the, turn, of, the, new, year, he, was, on, his, last, legs, among, edward, gibbon, s, maladies, was, gout, gibbon, is, also, believed, to, have, suffered, from, an, extreme, case, of, scrotal, swelling, probably, a, hydrocele, testis, a, condition, that, causes, the, scrotum, to, swell, with, fluid, in, a, compartment, overlying, either, testicle, in, an, age, when, close, fitting, clothes, were, fashionable, his, condition, led, to, a, chronic, and, disfiguring, inflammation, that, left, gibbon, a, lonely, figure, as, his, condition, worsened, he, underwent, numerous, procedures, to, alleviate, the, condition, but, with, no, enduring, success, in, early, january, the, last, of, a, series, of, three, operations, caused, an, unremitting, peritonitis, to, set, in, and, spread, from, which, he, died, the, english, giant, of, the, enlightenment, finally, succumbed, at, 12, 45, pm, 16, january, 1794, at, age, 56, he, was, buried, in, the, sheffield, mausoleum, attached, to, the, north, transept, of, the, church, of, st, mary, and, st, andrew, fletching, east, sussex, having, died, in, fletching, while, staying, with, his, great, friend, lord, sheffield, gibbon, s, estate, was, valued, at, approximately, 26, 000, he, left, most, of, his, property, to, cousins, as, stipulated, in, his, will, sheffield, oversaw, the, sale, of, his, library, at, auction, to, william, beckford, for, 950, what, happened, next, suggests, that, beckford, may, have, known, of, gibbon, s, moralistic, impertinent, animadversion, at, his, expense, in, the, presence, of, the, duchess, of, devonshire, at, lausanne, gibbon, s, wish, that, his, 6, 000, book, library, would, not, be, locked, up, under, the, key, of, a, jealous, master, was, effectively, denied, by, beckford, who, retained, it, in, lausanne, until, 1801, before, inspecting, it, then, locking, it, up, again, until, at, least, as, late, as, 1818, before, giving, most, of, the, books, back, to, gibbon, s, physician, dr, scholl, who, had, helped, negotiate, the, sale, in, the, first, place, beckford, s, annotated, copy, of, the, decline, and, fall, turned, up, in, christie, s, in, 1953, complete, with, his, critique, of, what, he, considered, the, author, s, ludicrous, self, complacency, your, frequent, distortion, of, historical, truth, to, provoke, a, gibe, or, excite, a, sneer, your, ignorance, of, oriental, languages, defunct, a, view, frequently, attributed, to, gibbon, that, the, roman, empire, fell, due, to, its, embrace, of, christianity, is, not, widely, accepted, by, scholars, today, gibbon, argued, that, with, the, empire, s, new, christian, character, large, sums, of, wealth, that, would, have, otherwise, been, used, in, the, secular, affairs, in, promoting, the, state, were, transferred, to, promoting, the, activities, of, the, church, however, the, pre, christian, empire, also, spent, large, financial, sums, on, religious, affairs, and, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, the, change, of, religion, increased, the, amount, of, resources, the, empire, spent, on, religion, gibbon, further, argued, that, new, attitudes, in, christianity, caused, many, christians, of, wealth, to, renounce, their, lifestyles, and, enter, a, monastic, lifestyle, and, so, stop, participating, in, the, support, of, the, empire, however, while, many, christians, of, wealth, did, become, monastics, this, paled, in, comparison, to, the, participants, in, the, imperial, bureaucracy, although, gibbon, further, pointed, out, that, the, importance, christianity, placed, on, peace, caused, a, decline, in, the, number, of, people, serving, the, military, the, decline, was, so, small, as, to, be, negligible, for, the, army, s, effectiveness, many, scholars, argue, that, gibbon, did, not, in, fact, blame, christianity, for, the, empire, s, fall, rather, attributing, its, decline, to, the, effects, of, luxury, and, the, consequent, erosion, of, its, martial, character, such, a, view, echoes, the, outlook, of, the, greek, historian, polybius, who, similarly, explained, the, decadent, greek, world, s, eclipse, by, the, ascendant, roman, republic, in, mediterranean, affairs, in, this, understanding, of, gibbon, the, process, of, rome, s, decay, was, well, underway, before, christian, adherents, numbered, a, large, proportion, of, the, empire, hence, although, gibbon, might, have, seen, christianity, as, hastening, rome, s, fall, he, did, not, consider, it, as, the, root, cause, gibbon, s, work, has, been, criticised, for, its, scathing, view, of, the, christian, church, as, laid, down, in, chapters, xv, and, xvi, a, situation, that, resulted, in, the, banning, of, the, book, in, several, countries, gibbon, s, was, accused, of, disrespecting, and, none, too, lightly, the, character, of, christian, doctrine, by, treat, the, christian, church, as, a, phenomenon, of, general, history, not, a, special, case, admitting, supernatural, explanations, and, disallowing, criticism, of, its, adherents, more, specifically, the, chapters, excoriated, the, church, for, supplanting, in, an, unnecessarily, destructive, way, the, great, culture, that, preceded, it, and, for, the, outrage, of, religious, intolerance, and, warfare, gibbon, in, letters, to, holroyd, and, others, expected, some, type, of, church, inspired, backlash, but, the, harshness, of, the, ensuing, torrents, exceeded, anything, he, or, his, friends, had, anticipated, contemporary, detractors, such, as, joseph, priestley, and, richard, watson, stoked, the, nascent, fire, but, the, most, severe, of, these, attacks, was, an, acrimonious, piece, by, the, young, cleric, henry, edwards, davis, gibbon, s, apparent, antagonism, to, christian, doctrine, spilled, over, into, the, jewish, faith, leading, to, charges, of, anti, semitism, for, example, he, wrote, from, the, reign, of, nero, to, that, of, antoninus, pius, the, jews, discovered, a, fierce, impatience, of, the, dominion, of, rome, which, repeatedly, broke, out, in, the, most, furious, massacres, and, insurrections, humanity, is, shocked, at, the, recital, of, the, horrid, cruelties, which, they, committed, in, the, cities, of, egypt, of, cyprus, and, of, cyrene, where, they, dwelt, in, treacherous, friendship, with, the, unsuspecting, natives, and, we, are, tempted, to, applaud, the, severe, retaliation, which, was, exercised, by, the, arms, of, legions, against, a, race, of, fanatics, whose, dire, and, credulous, superstition, seemed, to, render, them, the, implacable, enemies, not, only, of, the, roman, government, but, also, of, mankind, gibbon, is, considered, to, be, a, son, of, the, enlightenment, and, this, is, reflected, in, his, famous, verdict, on, the, history, of, the, middle, ages, i, have, described, the, triumph, of, barbarism, and, religion, politically, he, rejected, the, radical, egalitarian, movements, of, the, time, notably, the, american, and, french, revolutions, and, dismissed, overly, rationalistic, applications, of, the, rights, of, man, gibbon, s, work, has, been, praised, for, its, style, his, piquant, epigrams, and, its, effective, irony, winston, churchill, memorably, noted, in, my, early, life, i, set, out, upon, gibbon, s, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, was, immediately, dominated, both, by, the, story, and, the, style, i, devoured, gibbon, i, rode, triumphantly, through, it, from, end, to, end, and, enjoyed, it, all, churchill, modelled, much, of, his, own, literary, style, on, gibbon, s, like, gibbon, he, dedicated, himself, to, producing, a, vivid, historical, narrative, ranging, widely, over, period, and, place, and, enriched, by, analysis, and, reflection, unusually, for, the, 18th, century, gibbon, was, never, content, with, secondhand, accounts, when, the, primary, sources, were, accessible, though, most, of, these, were, drawn, from, well, known, printed, editions, i, have, always, endeavoured, he, says, to, draw, from, the, fountain, head, that, my, curiosity, as, well, as, a, sense, of, duty, has, always, urged, me, to, study, the, originals, and, that, if, they, have, sometimes, eluded, my, search, i, have, carefully, marked, the, secondary, evidence, on, whose, faith, a, passage, or, a, fact, were, reduced, to, depend, in, this, insistence, upon, the, importance, of, primary, sources, gibbon, is, considered, by, many, to, be, one, of, the, first, modern, historians, in, accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and, comprehensive, grasp, of, a, vast, subject, the, history, is, unsurpassable, it, is, the, one, english, history, which, may, be, regarded, as, definitive, whatever, its, shortcomings, the, book, is, artistically, imposing, as, well, as, historically, unimpeachable, as, a, vast, panorama, of, a, great, period, the, subject, of, gibbon, s, writing, as, well, as, his, ideas, and, style, have, influenced, other, writers, besides, his, influence, on, churchill, gibbon, was, also, a, model, for, isaac, asimov, in, his, writing, of, the, foundation, trilogy, which, he, said, involved, a, little, bit, of, cribbin, from, the, works, of, edward, gibbon, evelyn, waugh, admired, gibbon, s, style, but, not, his, secular, viewpoint, in, waugh, s, 1950, novel, helena, the, early, christian, author, lactantius, worries, about, the, possibility, of, a, false, historian, with, the, mind, of, cicero, or, tacitus, and, the, soul, of, an, animal, and, he, nodded, towards, the, gibbon, who, fretted, his, golden, chain, and, chattered, for, fruit, most, of, this, article, including, quotations, unless, otherwise, noted, has, been, adapted, from, stephen, s, entry, on, edward, gibbon, in, the, dictionary, of, national, biography
