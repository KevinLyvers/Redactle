and, saw, their, work, glass, recalls, the, bohemian, life, you, see, in, orph, e, was, the, life, i, was, attracted, to, and, those, were, the, people, i, hung, out, with, glass, studied, at, the, juilliard, school, of, music, where, the, keyboard, was, his, main, instrument, his, composition, teachers, included, vincent, persichetti, and, william, bergsma, fellow, students, included, steve,

influenced, his, work, throughout, his, life, as, the, composer, admitted, in, 1979, the, composers, i, studied, with, boulanger, are, the, people, i, still, think, about, most, bach, and, mozart, glass, later, wrote, in, his, autobiography, music, by, philip, glass, in, 1987, that, the, new, music, performed, at, pierre, boulez, s, domaine, musical, concerts, in, paris, lacked, any, excitement, for, him, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, music, by, john, cage, and, morton, feldman, but, he, was, deeply, impressed, by, new, films, and, theatre, performances, his, move, away, from, modernist, composers, such, as, boulez, and, stockhausen, was, nuanced, rather, than, outright, rejection, that, generation, wanted, disciples, and, as, we, didn, t, join, up, it, was, taken, to, mean, that, we, hated, the, music, which, wasn, t, true, we, d, studied, them, at, juilliard, and, knew, their, music, how, on, earth, can, you, reject, berio, those, early, works, of, stockhausen, are, still, beautiful, but, there, was, just, no, point, in, attempting, to, do, their, music, better, than, they, did, and, so, we, started, somewhere, else, during, this, time, he, encountered, revolutionary, films, of, the, french, new, wave, such, as, those, of, jean, luc, godard, and, fran, ois, truffaut, which, upended, the, rules, set, by, an, older, generation, of, artists, and, glass, made, friends, with, american, visual, artists, the, sculptor, richard, serra, and, his, wife, nancy, graves, actors, and, directors, joanne, akalaitis, ruth, maleczech, david, warrilow, and, lee, breuer, with, whom, glass, later, founded, the, experimental, theatre, group, mabou, mines, together, with, akalaitis, they, married, in, 1965, glass, in, turn, attended, performances, by, theatre, groups, including, jean, louis, barrault, s, od, on, theatre, the, living, theatre, and, the, berliner, ensemble, in, 1964, to, 1965, these, significant, encounters, resulted, in, a, collaboration, with, breuer, for, which, glass, contributed, music, for, a, 1965, staging, of, samuel, beckett, s, com, die, play, 1963, the, resulting, piece, written, for, two, soprano, saxophones, was, directly, influenced, by, the, play, s, open, ended, repetitive, and, almost, musical, structure, and, was, the, first, one, of, a, series, of, four, early, pieces, in, a, minimalist, yet, still, dissonant, idiom, after, play, glass, also, acted, in, 1966, as, music, director, of, a, breuer, production, of, brecht, s, mother, courage, and, her, children, featuring, the, theatre, score, by, paul, dessau, in, parallel, with, his, early, excursions, in, experimental, theatre, glass, worked, in, winter, 1965, and, spring, 1966, as, a, music, director, and, composer, on, a, film, score, chappaqua, conrad, rooks, 1966, with, ravi, shankar, and, alla, rakha, which, added, another, important, influence, on, glass, s, musical, thinking, his, distinctive, style, arose, from, his, work, with, shankar, and, rakha, and, their, perception, of, rhythm, in, indian, music, as, being, entirely, additive, he, renounced, all, his, compositions, in, a, moderately, modern, style, resembling, milhaud, s, aaron, copland, s, and, samuel, barber, s, and, began, writing, pieces, based, on, repetitive, structures, of, indian, music, and, a, sense, of, time, influenced, by, samuel, beckett, a, piece, for, two, actresses, and, chamber, ensemble, a, work, for, chamber, ensemble, and, his, first, numbered, string, quartet, no, 1, 1966, glass, then, left, paris, for, northern, india, in, 1966, where, he, came, in, contact, with, tibetan, refugees, and, began, to, gravitate, towards, buddhism, he, met, tenzin, gyatso, the, 14th, dalai, lama, in, 1972, and, has, been, a, strong, supporter, of, the, tibetan, independence, ever, since, glass, musical, style, is, instantly, recognizable, with, its, trademark, churning, ostinatos, undulating, arpeggios, and, repeating, rhythms, that, morph, over, various, lengths, of, time, atop, broad, fields, of, tonal, harmony, that, style, has, taken, permanent, root, in, our, pop, middlebrow, sensibility, glass, music, is, now, indelibly, a, part, of, our, cultural, lingua, franca, just, a, click, away, on, youtube, john, von, rhein, chicago, tribune, writer, shortly, after, arriving, in, new, york, city, in, march, 1967, glass, attended, a, performance, of, works, by, steve, reich, including, the, ground, breaking, minimalist, piece, piano, phase, which, left, a, deep, impression, on, him, he, simplified, his, style, and, turned, to, a, radical, consonant, vocabulary, finding, little, sympathy, from, traditional, performers, and, performance, spaces, glass, eventually, formed, an, ensemble, with, fellow, ex, student, jon, gibson, and, others, and, began, performing, mainly, in, art, galleries, and, studio, lofts, of, soho, the, visual, artist, richard, serra, provided, glass, with, gallery, contacts, while, both, collaborated, on, various, sculptures, films, and, installations, from, 1971, to, 1974, he, was, serra, s, regular, studio, assistant, between, summer, of, 1967, and, the, end, of, 1968, glass, composed, nine, works, including, strung, out, for, amplified, solo, violin, composed, in, summer, of, 1967, gradus, for, solo, saxophone, 1968, music, in, the, shape, of, a, square, for, two, flutes, composed, in, may, 1968, an, homage, to, erik, satie, how, now, for, solo, piano, 1968, and, 1, 1, for, amplified, tabletop, november, 1968, which, were, clearly, designed, to, experiment, more, fully, with, his, new, found, minimalist, approach, the, first, concert, of, glass, s, new, music, was, at, jonas, mekas, s, film, makers, cinemath, que, anthology, film, archives, in, september, 1968, this, concert, included, the, first, work, of, this, series, with, strung, out, performed, by, the, violinist, pixley, rothschild, and, music, in, the, shape, of, a, square, performed, by, glass, and, gibson, the, musical, scores, were, tacked, on, the, wall, and, the, performers, had, to, move, while, playing, glass, s, new, works, met, with, a, very, enthusiastic, response, by, the, audience, which, consisted, mainly, of, visual, and, performance, artists, who, were, highly, sympathetic, to, glass, s, reductive, approach, apart, from, his, music, career, glass, had, a, moving, company, with, his, cousin, the, sculptor, jene, highstein, and, also, worked, as, a, plumber, and, cab, driver, during, 1973, to, 1978, he, recounts, installing, a, dishwasher, and, looking, up, from, his, work, to, see, an, astonished, robert, hughes, time, magazine, s, art, critic, staring, at, him, during, this, time, he, made, friends, with, other, new, york, based, artists, such, as, sol, lewitt, nancy, graves, michael, snow, bruce, nauman, laurie, anderson, and, chuck, close, who, created, a, now, famous, portrait, of, glass, glass, returned, the, compliment, in, 2005, with, a, musical, portrait, of, chuck, close, for, piano, with, 1, 1, and, two, pages, composed, in, february, 1969, glass, turned, to, a, more, rigorous, approach, to, his, most, basic, minimalist, technique, additive, process, pieces, which, were, followed, in, the, same, year, by, music, in, contrary, motion, and, music, in, fifths, a, kind, of, homage, to, his, composition, teacher, nadia, boulanger, who, pointed, out, hidden, fifths, in, his, works, but, regarded, them, as, cardinal, sins, eventually, glass, s, music, grew, less, austere, becoming, more, complex, and, dramatic, with, pieces, such, as, music, in, similar, motion, 1969, and, music, with, changing, parts, 1970, these, pieces, were, performed, by, the, philip, glass, ensemble, in, the, whitney, museum, of, american, art, in, 1969, and, in, the, solomon, r, guggenheim, museum, in, 1970, often, encountering, hostile, reaction, from, critics, but, glass, s, music, was, also, met, with, enthusiasm, from, younger, artists, such, as, brian, eno, and, david, bowie, at, the, royal, college, of, art, ca, 1970, eno, described, this, encounter, with, glass, s, music, as, one, of, the, most, extraordinary, musical, experiences, of, life, as, a, viscous, bath, of, pure, thick, energy, concluding, this, was, actually, the, most, detailed, music, i, d, ever, heard, it, was, all, intricacy, exotic, harmonics, in, 1970, glass, returned, to, the, theatre, composing, music, for, the, theatre, group, mabou, mines, resulting, in, his, first, minimalist, pieces, employing, voices, red, horse, animation, and, music, for, voices, both, 1970, and, premiered, at, the, paula, cooper, gallery, after, differences, of, opinion, with, steve, reich, in, 1971, glass, formed, the, philip, glass, ensemble, while, reich, formed, steve, reich, and, musicians, an, amplified, ensemble, including, keyboards, wind, instruments, saxophones, flutes, and, soprano, voices, glass, s, music, for, his, ensemble, culminated, in, the, four, hour, long, music, in, twelve, parts, 1971, 1974, which, began, as, a, single, piece, with, twelve, instrumental, parts, but, developed, into, a, cycle, that, summed, up, glass, s, musical, achievement, since, 1967, and, even, transcended, it, the, last, part, features, a, twelve, tone, theme, sung, by, the, soprano, voice, of, the, ensemble, i, had, broken, the, rules, of, modernism, and, so, i, thought, it, was, time, to, break, some, of, my, own, rules, according, to, glass, though, he, finds, the, term, minimalist, inaccurate, to, describe, his, later, work, glass, does, accept, this, term, for, pieces, up, to, and, including, music, in, 12, parts, excepting, this, last, part, which, was, the, end, of, minimalism, for, glass, as, he, pointed, out, i, had, worked, for, eight, or, nine, years, inventing, a, system, and, now, i, d, written, through, it, and, come, out, the, other, end, he, now, prefers, to, describe, himself, as, a, composer, of, music, with, repetitive, structures, glass, continued, his, work, with, a, series, of, instrumental, works, called, another, look, at, harmony, 1975, 1977, for, glass, this, series, demonstrated, a, new, start, hence, the, title, what, i, was, looking, for, was, a, way, of, combining, harmonic, progression, with, the, rhythmic, structure, i, had, been, developing, to, produce, a, new, overall, structure, i, d, taken, everything, out, with, my, early, works, and, it, was, now, time, to, decide, just, what, i, wanted, to, put, in, a, process, that, would, occupy, me, for, several, years, to, come, parts, 1, and, 2, of, another, look, at, harmony, were, included, in, a, collaboration, with, robert, wilson, a, piece, of, musical, theater, later, designated, by, glass, as, the, first, opera, of, his, portrait, opera, trilogy, einstein, on, the, beach, composed, in, spring, to, fall, of, 1975, in, close, collaboration, with, wilson, glass, s, first, opera, was, first, premiered, in, summer, 1976, at, the, festival, d, avignon, and, in, november, of, the, same, year, to, a, mixed, and, partly, enthusiastic, reaction, from, the, audience, at, the, metropolitan, opera, in, new, york, city, scored, for, the, philip, glass, ensemble, solo, violin, chorus, and, featuring, actors, reciting, texts, by, christopher, knowles, lucinda, childs, and, samuel, m, johnson, glass, s, and, wilson, s, essentially, plotless, opera, was, conceived, as, a, metaphorical, look, at, albert, einstein, scientist, humanist, amateur, musician, and, the, man, whose, theories, led, to, the, splitting, of, the, atom, evoking, nuclear, holocaust, in, the, climactic, scene, as, critic, tim, page, pointed, out, as, with, another, look, at, harmony, einstein, added, a, new, functional, harmony, that, set, it, apart, from, the, early, conceptual, works, composer, tom, johnson, came, to, the, same, conclusion, comparing, the, solo, violin, music, to, johann, sebastian, bach, and, the, organ, figures, to, those, alberti, basses, mozart, loved, so, much, the, piece, was, praised, by, the, washington, post, as, one, of, the, seminal, artworks, of, the, century, einstein, on, the, beach, was, followed, by, further, music, for, projects, by, the, theatre, group, mabou, mines, such, as, dressed, like, an, egg, 1975, and, again, music, for, plays, and, adaptations, from, prose, by, samuel, beckett, such, as, the, lost, ones, 1975, cascando, 1975, mercier, and, camier, 1979, glass, also, turned, to, other, media, two, multi, movement, instrumental, works, for, the, philip, glass, ensemble, originated, as, music, for, film, and, tv, north, star, 1977, score, for, the, documentary, north, star, mark, di, suvero, by, fran, ois, de, menil, and, barbara, rose, and, four, short, cues, for, the, children, s, tv, series, sesame, street, named, geometry, of, circles, 1979, another, series, fourth, series, 1977, 79, included, music, for, chorus, and, organ, part, one, 1977, organ, and, piano, part, two, and, part, four, 1979, and, music, for, a, radio, adaption, of, constance, dejong, s, novel, modern, love, part, three, 1978, part, two, and, part, four, were, used, and, hence, renamed, in, two, dance, productions, by, choreographer, lucinda, childs, who, had, already, contributed, to, and, performed, in, einstein, on, the, beach, part, two, was, included, in, dance, a, collaboration, with, visual, artist, sol, lewitt, 1979, and, part, four, was, renamed, as, mad, rush, and, performed, by, glass, on, several, occasions, such, as, the, first, public, appearance, of, the, 14th, dalai, lama, in, new, york, city, in, fall, 1981, the, piece, demonstrates, glass, s, turn, to, more, traditional, models, the, composer, added, a, conclusion, to, an, open, structured, piece, which, can, be, interpreted, as, a, sign, that, he, abandoned, the, radical, non, narrative, undramatic, approaches, of, his, early, period, as, the, pianist, steffen, schleiermacher, points, out, in, spring, 1978, glass, received, a, commission, from, the, netherlands, opera, as, well, as, a, rockefeller, foundation, grant, which, marked, the, end, of, his, need, to, earn, money, from, non, musical, employment, with, the, commission, glass, continued, his, work, in, music, theater, composing, his, opera, satyagraha, composed, in, 1978, 1979, premiered, in, 1980, at, rotterdam, based, on, the, early, life, of, mahatma, gandhi, in, south, africa, leo, tolstoy, rabindranath, tagore, and, martin, luther, king, jr, for, satyagraha, glass, worked, in, close, collaboration, with, two, soho, friends, the, writer, constance, dejong, who, provided, the, libretto, and, the, set, designer, robert, israel, this, piece, was, in, other, ways, a, turning, point, for, glass, as, it, was, his, first, work, since, 1963, scored, for, symphony, orchestra, even, if, the, most, prominent, parts, were, still, reserved, for, solo, voices, and, chorus, shortly, after, completing, the, score, in, august, 1979, glass, met, the, conductor, dennis, russell, davies, whom, he, helped, prepare, for, performances, in, germany, using, a, piano, four, hands, version, of, the, score, together, they, started, to, plan, another, opera, to, be, premiered, at, the, stuttgart, state, opera, while, planning, a, third, part, of, his, portrait, trilogy, glass, turned, to, smaller, music, theatre, projects, such, as, the, non, narrative, madrigal, opera, for, six, voices, and, violin, and, viola, 1980, and, the, photographer, a, biographic, study, on, the, photographer, eadweard, muybridge, 1982, glass, also, continued, to, write, for, the, orchestra, with, the, score, of, koyaanisqatsi, godfrey, reggio, 1981, 1982, some, pieces, which, were, not, used, in, the, film, such, as, fa, ades, eventually, appeared, on, the, album, glassworks, 1982, cbs, records, which, brought, glass, s, music, to, a, wider, public, the, portrait, trilogy, was, completed, with, akhnaten, 1982, 1983, premiered, in, 1984, a, vocal, and, orchestral, composition, sung, in, akkadian, biblical, hebrew, and, ancient, egyptian, in, addition, this, opera, featured, an, actor, reciting, ancient, egyptian, texts, in, the, language, of, the, audience, akhnaten, was, commissioned, by, the, stuttgart, opera, in, a, production, designed, by, achim, freyer, it, premiered, simultaneously, at, the, houston, opera, in, a, production, directed, by, david, freeman, and, designed, by, peter, sellars, at, the, time, of, the, commission, the, stuttgart, opera, house, was, undergoing, renovation, necessitating, the, use, of, a, nearby, playhouse, with, a, smaller, orchestra, pit, upon, learning, this, glass, and, conductor, dennis, russell, davies, visited, the, playhouse, placing, music, stands, around, the, pit, to, determine, how, many, players, the, pit, could, accommodate, the, two, found, they, could, not, fit, a, full, orchestra, in, the, pit, glass, decided, to, eliminate, the, violins, which, had, the, effect, of, giving, the, orchestra, a, low, dark, sound, that, came, to, characterize, the, piece, and, suited, the, subject, very, well, as, glass, remarked, in, 1992, akhnaten, is, significant, in, his, work, since, it, represents, a, first, extension, out, of, a, triadic, harmonic, language, an, experiment, with, the, polytonality, of, his, teachers, persichetti, and, milhaud, a, musical, technique, which, glass, compares, to, an, optical, illusion, such, as, in, the, paintings, of, josef, albers, glass, again, collaborated, with, robert, wilson, on, another, opera, the, civil, wars, 1983, premiered, in, 1984, which, also, functioned, as, the, final, part, the, rome, section, of, wilson, s, epic, work, by, the, same, name, originally, planned, for, an,

that, were, played, in, the, intervals, of, the, dramatization, this, composition, was, initially, regarded, by, the, composer, as, a, piece, of, gebrauchsmusik, music, for, use, like, salt, and, pepper, just, something, for, the, table, as, he, noted, eventually, company, was, published, as, glass, s, string, quartet, no, 2, and, in, a, version, for, string, orchestra, being, performed, by,

point, that, developed, his, technique, of, film, scoring, in, a, very, special, way, glass, also, dedicated, himself, to, vocal, works, with, two, sets, of, songs, three, songs, for, chorus, 1984,

his, chamber, and, orchestral, works, were, also, written, in, a, more, and, more, traditional, and, lyrical, style, in, these, works, glass, often, employs, old, musical, forms, such, as, the, chaconne, and, the, passacaglia, for, instance, in, satyagraha, the, violin, concerto, no, 1, 1987, symphony, no, 3, 1995, echorus, 1995, and, also, recent, works, such, as, symphony, no, 8, 2005,

violin, concerto, and, so, i, grew, up, listening, to, the, mendelssohn, the, paganini, the, brahms, concertos, so, when, i, decided, to, write, a, violin, concerto, i, wanted, to, write, one, that, my, father, would, have, liked, among, its, multiple, recordings, in, 1992, the, concerto, was, performed, and, recorded, by, gidon, kremer, and, the, vienna, philharmonic, this, turn, to, orchestral,

glass, met, the, poet, allen, ginsberg, by, chance, in, a, book, store, in, the, east, village, of, new, york, city, and, they, immediately, decided, on, the, spot, to, do, something, together, reached, for, one, of, allen, s, books, and, chose, wichita, vortex, sutra, a, piece, for, reciter, and, piano, which, in, turn, developed, into, a, music, theatre, piece, for, singers, and, ensemble,

incidental, music, for, plays, such, as, music, from, the, screens, 1989, 1990, this, work, originated, in, one, of, many, theater, music, collaborations, with, the, director, joanne, akalaitis, who, originally, asked, the, gambian, musician, foday, musa, suso, to, do, the, score, in, collaboration, with, a, western, composer, glass, had, already, collaborated, with, suso, in, the, film, score,

closure, of, the, 1998, world, fair, in, lisbon, especially, in, the, voyage, the, composer, explore, new, territory, with, its, newly, arching, lyricism, sibelian, starkness, and, sweep, and, dark, brooding, tone, a, reflection, of, its, increasingly, chromatic, and, dissonant, palette, as, one, commentator, put, it, glass, remixed, the, s, express, song, hey, music, lover, for, the, b, side, of, its, 1989, release, as, a, single, after, these, operas, glass, began, working, on, a, symphonic, cycle, commissioned, by, the, conductor, dennis, russell, davies, who, told, glass, at, the, time, i, m, not, going, to, let, you, be, one, of, those, opera, composers, who, never, write, a, symphony, glass, responded, with, a, pair, of, three, movement, symphonies, low, and, symphony, no, 2, his, first, in, an, ongoing, series, of, symphonies, is, a, combination, of, the, composer, s, own, musical, material, with, themes, featured, in, prominent, tracks, of, the, david, bowie, brian, eno, album, low, 1977, whereas, symphony, no, 2, is, described, by, glass, as, a, study, in, polytonality, he, referred, to, the, music, of, honegger, milhaud, and, villa, lobos, as, possible, models, for, his, symphony, with, the, concerto, grosso, 1992, symphony, no, 3, 1995, a, concerto, for, saxophone, quartet, and, orchestra, 1995, written, for, the, rascher, quartet, all, commissioned, by, conductor, dennis, russell, davies, and, echorus, 1994, 95, a, more, transparent, refined, and, intimate, chamber, orchestral, style, paralleled, the, excursions, of, his, large, scale, symphonic, pieces, in, the, four, movements, of, his, third, symphony, glass, treats, a, 19, piece, string, orchestra, as, an, extended, chamber, ensemble, in, the, third, movement, glass, re, uses, the, chaconne, as, a, formal, device, one, commentator, characterized, glass, s, symphony, as, one, of, the, composer, s, most, tautly, unified, works, the, third, symphony, was, closely, followed, by, a, fourth, subtitled, heroes, 1996, commissioned, the, american, composers, orchestra, its, six, movements, are, symphonic, reworkings, of, themes, by, glass, david, bowie, and, brian, eno, from, their, album, heroes, 1977, as, in, other, works, by, the, composer, it, is, also, a, hybrid, work, and, exists, in, two, versions, one, for, the, concert, hall, and, another, shorter, one, for, dance, choreographed, by, twyla, tharp, another, commission, by, dennis, russell, davies, was, a, second, series, for, piano, the, etudes, for, piano, dedicated, to, davies, as, well, as, the, production, designer, achim, freyer, the, complete, first, set, of, ten, etudes, has, been, recorded, and, performed, by, glass, himself, bruce, brubaker, and, dennis, russell, davies, have, each, recorded, the, original, set, of, six, most, of, the, etudes, are, composed, in, the, post, minimalist, and, increasingly, lyrical, style, of, the, times, within, the, framework, of, a, concise, form, glass, explores, possible, sonorities, ranging, from, typically, baroque, passagework, to, romantically, tinged, moods, some, of, the, pieces, also, appeared, in, different, versions, such, as, in, the, theatre, music, to, robert, wilson, s, persephone, 1994, commissioned, by, the, relache, ensemble, or, echorus, a, version, of, etude, no, 2, for, two, violins, and, string, orchestra, written, for, edna, mitchell, and, yehudi, menuhin, 1995, glass, s, prolific, output, in, the, 1990s, continued, to, include, operas, with, an, opera, triptych, 1991, 1996, which, the, composer, described, as, an, homage, to, writer, and, film, director, jean, cocteau, based, on, his, prose, and, cinematic, work, orph, e, 1950, la, belle, et, la, b, te, 1946, and, the, novel, les, enfants, terribles, 1929, later, made, into, a, film, by, cocteau, and, jean, pierre, melville, 1950, in, the, same, way, the, triptych, is, also, a, musical, homage, to, the, work, of, the, group, of, french, composers, associated, with, cocteau, les, six, and, especially, to, glass, s, teacher, darius, milhaud, as, well, as, to, various, 18th, century, composers, such, as, gluck, and, bach, whose, music, featured, as, an, essential, part, of, the, films, by, cocteau, the, inspiration, of, the, first, part, of, the, trilogy, orph, e, composed, in, 1991, and, premiered, in, 1993, at, the, american, repertory, theatre, can, be, conceptually, and, musically, traced, to, gluck, s, opera, orfeo, ed, euridice, orph, e, et, euridyce, 1762, 1774, which, had, a, prominent, part, in, cocteau, s, 1949, film, orphee, one, theme, of, the, opera, the, death, of, eurydice, has, some, similarity, to, the, composer, s, personal, life, the, opera, was, composed, after, the, unexpected, death, in, 1991, of, glass, s, wife, artist, candy, jernigan, one, can, only, suspect, that, orpheus, grief, must, have, resembled, the, composer, s, own, k, robert, schwartz, suggests, the, opera, s, transparency, of, texture, a, subtlety, of, instrumental, color, a, newly, expressive, and, unfettered, vocal, writing, was, praised, and, the, guardian, s, critic, remarked, glass, has, a, real, affinity, for, the, french, text, and, sets, the, words, eloquently, underpinning, them, with, delicately, patterned, instrumental, textures, for, the, second, opera, la, belle, et, la, b, te, 1994, scored, for, either, the, philip, glass, ensemble, or, a, more, conventional, chamber, orchestra, glass, replaced, the, soundtrack, including, georges, auric, s, film, music, of, cocteau, s, film, wrote, a, new, fully, operatic, score, and, synchronize, it, with, the, film, the, final, part, of, the, triptych, returned, again, to, a, more, traditional, setting, with, the, dance, opera, les, enfants, terribles, 1996, scored, for, voices, three, pianos, and, dancers, with, choreography, by, susan, marshall, the, characters, are, depicted, by, both, singers, and, dancers, the, scoring, of, the, opera, evokes, bach, s, concerto, for, four, harpsichords, but, in, another, way, also, the, snow, which, falls, relentlessly, throughout, the, opera, bearing, witness, to, the, unfolding, events, here, time, stands, still, there, is, only, music, and, the, movement, of, children, through, space, glass, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, glass, s, lyrical, and, romantic, styles, peaked, with, a, variety, of, projects, operas, theatre, and, film, scores, martin, scorsese, s, kundun, 1997, godfrey, reggio, s, naqoyqatsi, 2002, and, stephen, daldry, s, the, hours, 2002, a, series, of, five, concerts, and,

in, celebration, of, glass, s, sixty, fifth, birthday, and, developed, from, glass, s, collaboration, with, allen, ginsberg, poet, piano, ginsberg, glass, based, on, his, poem, of, the, same, name, besides, writing, for, the, concert, hall, glass, continued, his, ongoing, operatic, series, with, adaptions, from, literary, texts, the, marriages, of, zones, 3, 4, and, 5, story, libretto, by, doris, lessing, in, the, penal, colony, 2000, after, the, story, by, franz, kafka, and, the, chamber, opera, the, sound, of, a, voice, 2003, with, david, henry, hwang, which, features, the, pipa, performed, by, wu, man, at, its, premiere, glass, also, collaborated, again, with, the, co, author, of, einstein, on, the, beach, robert, wilson, on, monsters, of, grace, 1998, and, created, a, biographic, opera, on, the, life, of, astronomer, galileo, galilei, 2001, in, the, early, 2000s, glass, started, a, series, of, five, concerti, with, the, tirol, concerto, for, piano, and, orchestra, 2000, premiered, by, dennis, russell, davies, as, conductor, and, soloist, and, the, concerto, fantasy, for, two, timpanists, and, orchestra, 2000, for, the, timpanist, jonathan, haas, the, concerto, for, cello, and, orchestra, 2001, had, its, premiere, performance, in, beijing, featuring, cellist, julian, lloyd, webber, it, was, composed, in, celebration, of, his, fiftieth, birthday, these, concertos, were, followed, by, the, concise, and, rigorously, neo, baroque, concerto, for, harpsichord, and, orchestra, 2002, demonstrating, in, its, transparent, chamber, orchestral, textures, glass, s, classical, technique, evocative, in, the, improvisatory, chords, of, its, beginning, a, toccata, of, froberger, or, frescobaldi, and, 18th, century, music, two, years, later, the, concerti, series, continued, with, piano, concerto, no, 2, after, lewis, and, clark, 2004, composed, for, the, pianist, paul, barnes, the, concerto, celebrates, the, pioneers, trek, across, north, america, and, the, second, movement, features, a, duet, for, piano, and, native, american, flute, with, the, chamber, opera, the, sound, of, a, voice, glass, s, piano, concerto, no, 2, might, be, regarded, as, bridging, his, traditional, compositions, and, his, more, popular, excursions, to, world, music, also, found, in, orion, also, composed, in, 2004, waiting, for, the, barbarians, an, opera, from, j, m, coetzee, s, novel, with, the, libretto, by, christopher, hampton, had, its, premiere, performance, in, september, 2005, glass, defined, the, work, as, a, social, political, opera, as, a, critique, on, the, bush, administration, s, war, in, iraq, a, dialogue, about, political, crisis, and, an, illustration, of, the, power, of, art, to, turn, our, attention, toward, the, human, dimension, of, history, while, the, opera, s, themes, are, imperialism, apartheid, and, torture, the, composer, chose, an, understated, approach, by, using, very, simple, means, and, the, orchestration, is, very, clear, and, very, traditional, it, s, almost, classical, in, sound, as, the, conductor, dennis, russell, davies, notes, two, months, after, the, premiere, of, this, opera, in, november, 2005, glass, s, symphony, no, 8, commissioned, by, the, bruckner, orchestra, linz, was, premiered, at, the, brooklyn, academy, of, music, in, new, york, city, after, three, symphonies, for, voices, and, orchestra, this, piece, was, a, return, to, purely, orchestral, and, abstract, composition, like, previous, works, written, for, the, conductor, dennis, russell, davies, the, 1992, concerto, grosso, and, the, 1995, symphony, no, 3, it, features, extended, solo, writing, critic, allan, kozinn, described, the, symphony, s, chromaticism, as, more, extreme, more, fluid, and, its, themes, and, textures, as, continually, changing, morphing, without, repetition, and, praised, the, symphony, s, unpredictable, orchestration, pointing, out, the, beautiful, flute, and, harp, variation, in, the, melancholy, second, movement, alex, ross, remarked, that, against, all, odds, this, work, succeeds, in, adding, something, certifiably, new, to, the, overstuffed, annals, of, the, classical, symphony, the, musical, material, is, cut, from, familiar, fabric, but, it, s, striking, that, the, composer, forgoes, the, expected, bustling, conclusion, and, instead, delves, into, a, mood, of, deepening, twilight, and, unending, night, the, passion, of, ramakrishna, 2006, was, composed, for, the, pacific, symphony, orchestra, the, pacific, chorale, and, the, conductor, carl, st, clair, the, 45, minutes, choral, work, is, based, on, the, writings, of, indian, spiritual, leader, ramakrishna, which, seem, to, have, genuinely, inspired, and, revived, the, composer, out, of, his, old, formulas, to, write, something, fresh, as, one, critic, remarked, whereas, another, noted, the, musical, style, breaks, little, new, ground, for, glass, except, for, the, glorious, handelian, ending, the, composer, s, style, ideally, fits, the, devotional, text, a, cello, suite, composed, for, the, cellist, wendy, sutter, songs, and, poems, for, solo, cello, 2005, 2007, was, equally, lauded, by, critics, it, was, described, by, lisa, hirsch, as, a, major, work, a, major, addition, to, the, cello, repertory, and, deeply, romantic, in, spirit, and, at, the, same, time, deeply, baroque, another, critic, anne, midgette, of, the, washington, post, noted, the, suite, maintains, an, unusual, degree, of, directness, and, warmth, she, also, noted, a, kinship, to, a, major, work, by, johann, sebastian, bach, digging, into, the, lower, registers, of, the, instrument, it, takes, flight, in, handfuls, of, notes, now, gentle, now, impassioned, variously, evoking, the, minor, mode, keening, of, klezmer, music, and, the, interior, meditations, of, bach, s, cello, suites, glass, himself, pointed, out, in, many, ways, it, owes, more, to, schubert, than, to, bach, in, 2007, glass, also, worked, alongside, leonard, cohen, on, an, adaptation, of, cohen, s, poetry, collection, book, of, longing, the, work, which, premiered, in, june, 2007, in, toronto, is, a, piece, for, seven, instruments, and, a, vocal, quartet, and, contains, recorded, spoken, word, performances, by, cohen, and, imagery, from, his, collection, appomattox, an, opera, surrounding, the, events, at, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, was, commissioned, by, the, san, francisco, opera, and, premiered, on, october, 5, 2007, as, in, waiting, for, the, barbarians, glass, collaborated, with, the, writer, christopher, hampton, and, as, with, the, preceding, opera, and, symphony, no, 8, the, piece, was, conducted, by, glass, s, long, time, collaborator, dennis, russell, davies, who, noted, in, his, recent, operas, the, bass, line, has, taken, on, an, increasing, prominence, an, increasing, use, of, melodic, elements, in, the, deep, register, in, the, contrabass, the, contrabassoon, he, s, increasingly, using, these, sounds, and, these, textures, can, be, derived, from, using, these, instruments, in, different, combinations, he, s, definitely, developed, more, skill, as, an, orchestrator, in, his, ability, to, conceive, melodies, and, harmonic, structures, for, specific, instrumental, groups, what, he, gives, them, to, play, is, very, organic, and, idiomatic, apart, from, this, large, scale, opera, glass, added, a, work, to, his, catalogue, of, theater, music, in, 2007, and, continuing, after, a, gap, of, twenty, years, to, write, music, for, the, dramatic, work, of, samuel, beckett, he, provided, a, hypnotic, original, score, for, a, compilation, of, beckett, s, short, plays, act, without, words, i, act, without, words, ii, rough, for, theatre, i, and, eh, joe, directed, by, joanne, akalaitis, and, premiered, in, december, 2007, glass, s, work, for, this, production, was, described, by, the, new, york, times, as, icy, repetitive, music, that, comes, closest, to, piercing, the, heart, between, 2008, and, 2010, glass, continued, to, work, on, a, series, of, chamber, music, pieces, which, started, with, songs, and, poems, the, four, movements, for, two, pianos, 2008, premiered, by,

akalaitis, and, kepler, 2009, yet, another, operatic, biography, of, a, scientist, or, explorer, the, opera, is, based, on, the, life, of, 17th, century, astronomer, johannes, kepler, against, the, background, of, the, thirty, years, war, with, a, libretto, compiled, from, kepler, s, texts, and, poems, by, his, contemporary, andreas, gryphius, it, is, glass, s, first, opera, in, german, and,
