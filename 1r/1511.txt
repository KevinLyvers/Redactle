1607, in, vlissingen, flushing, in, the, province, of, zealand, the, son, of, a, seaman, who, eventually, became, a, beer, porter, adriaen, michielszoon, and, aagje, jansdochter, many, anecdotes, were, told, of, de, ruyter, s, early, life, but, of, dubious, historical, value, for, a, time, he, worked, at, a, ropewalk, he, was, sent, to, sea, as, a, boatswain, s, apprentice, at, the, age, of, 11, the, usual, age, for, zeeland, boys, to, begin, seafaring, in, 1622, during, the, eighty, years, war, against, spain, he, fought, as, a, cannoneer, in, the, new, dutch, army, under, maurice, of,

english, bruijn, notes, that, an, anonymous, english, biographer, of, de, ruyter, claims, that, he, was, active, in, dublin, between, 1623, and, 1631, as, a, factor, for, the, vlissingen, based, merchant, house, of, the, lampsins, brothers, and, had, become, fluent, in, english, when, living, there, the, source, claimed, that, de, ruyter, had, a, slight, knowledge, of, the, irish, language, and, at, least, one, irish, friend, who, played, a, leading, role, in, the, capture, of, hms, royal, charles, in, 1667, de, ruyter, occasionally, travelled, as, supercargo, to, the, mediterranean, or, to, the, barbary, coast, in, those, years, he, usually, referred, to, himself, as, machgyel, adriensoon, his, name, in, the, zeelandic, dialect, he, spoke, as, he, had, not, yet, adopted, the, surname, de, ruyter, de, ruyter, was, most, probably, a, nickname, given, to, him, one, explanation, might, be, found, in, the, older, dutch, verb, ruyten, or, ruiten, which, means, to, raid, something, de, ruyter, was, known, to, do, as, a, privateer, with, the, lampsins, ship, den, graeuwen, heynst, another, suggestion, is, that, the, name, ruyter, meaning, horseman, commemorates, one, of, his, grandfathers, who, was, a, cavalry, trooper, on, 16, march, in, 1631, he, married, maayke, velders, a, farmer, s, daughter, on, 31, december, that, year, maayke, died, after, giving, birth, to, a, daughter, who, also, died, just, three, weeks, later, in, 1633, and, 1635, de, ruyter, sailed, as, a, navigating, officer, aboard, the, ship, groene, leeuw, green, lion, on, whaling, expeditions, to, jan, mayen, until, 1637, he, did, not, yet, have, a, command, of, his, own, in, the, summer, of, 1636, he, remarried, this, time, to, a, daughter, of, a, wealthy, burgher, named, neeltje, engels, who, gave, him, four, children, one, of, whom, died, shortly, after, birth, the, others, were, named, adriaen, b, 1637, neeltje, b, 1639, and, aelken, b, 1642, in, the, midst, of, this, in, 1637, de, ruyter, became, captain, of, a, private, ship, meant, to, hunt, for, the, dunkirkers, raiders, operating, from, dunkirk, who, were, preying, on, dutch, merchant, shipping, he, fulfilled, this, task, until, 1640, after, this, he, sailed, for, a, while, as, skipper, of, a, merchant, vessel, named, de, vlissinge, in, 1641, de, ruyter, was, nominated, by, the, admiralty, of, zeeland, to, become, the, captain, of, the, haze, a, merchant, ship, converted, man, of, war, carrying, 26, guns, in, a, fleet, under, admiral, gijsels, formed, to, assist, the, portuguese, in, the, portuguese, restoration, war, against, philip, iv, of, spain, who, was, also, philip, iii, of, portugal, the, dutch, fleet, was, to, join, a, portuguese, squadron, fighting, spain, at, sea, and, de, ruyter, was, appointed, to, be, its, schout, bij, nacht, or, third, in, command, although, this, expedition, had, little, success, de, ruyter, distinguished, himself, in, combat, against, a, spanish, fleet, in, the, inconclusive, action, on, 4, november, 1641, off, cape, st, vincent, however, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, two, ships, and, damage, to, others, in, this, action, and, the, withdrawal, of, the, portuguese, squadron, after, the, action, the, dutch, fleet, returned, home, without, completing, its, mission, after, the, fleet, was, disbanded, de, ruyter, returned, to, merchant, service, which, he, undertook, either, as, master, of, a, lampsins, ship, or, after, buying, his, own, ship, the, salamander, between, 1642, and, 1651, he, made, a, number, of, profitable, trading, sailings, to, morocco, brazil, and, the, west, indies, and, by, 1651, he, had, saved, enough, money, to, retire, in, 1650, de, ruyter, s, second, wife, who, in, 1649, had, given, him, a, second, son, engel, unexpectedly, died, on, 8, january, 1652, he, married, a, widow, anna, van, gelder, and, bought, a, house, in, flushing, for, his, proposed, retirement, which, lasted, less, than, a, year, during, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, of, 1652, 1654, de, ruyter, agreed, to, join, the, expanding, dutch, fleet, as, a, junior, flag, officer, or, commandeur, a, rank, broadly, comparable, to, that, of, commodore, commanding, a, zeelandic, squadron, of, director, s, ships, which, were, privately, financed, warships, after, he, had, initially, refused, the, post, on, the, grounds, that, others, were, better, qualified, for, it, de, ruyter, proved, his, worth, under, the, supreme, commander, lieutenant, admiral, maarten, tromp, the, rank, of, admiral, general, was, reserved, for, the, stadtholder, but, at, the, time, no, one, held, that, appointment, the, main, function, of, de, ruyter, s, squadron, was, to, convoy, outbound, or, returning, dutch, merchant, ships, through, the, english, channel, where, they, were, vulnerable, to, attacks, from, english, ships, based, at, portsmouth, or, plymouth, in, august, 1652, a, convoy, of, around, sixty, dutch, merchant, ships, left, the, netherlands, for, the, mediterranean, initially, with, an, escort, of, ten, warships, the, convoy, was, joined, off, the, coast, of, the, spanish, netherlands, by, a, further, escort, commanded, by, de, ruyter, of, between, twenty, and, thirty, fighting, ships, the, exact, number, of, dutch, fighting, ships, involved, in, the, subsequent, battle, is, unclear, but, de, ruyter, sailed, with, 21, warships, from, all, five, of, the, dutch, admiralties, two, large, dutch, east, india, warships, and, six, fireships, additional, warships, may, have, joined, him, on, route, to, the, convoy, and, at, least, one, warship, was, damaged, before, the, subsequent, battle, and, returned, to, port, on, 15, august, 1652, the, convoy, and, its, escort, were, sighted, by, an, english, fleet, commanded, by, general, at, sea, george, ayscue, with, around, 45, ships, three, of, these, were, warships, more, powerful, than, any, in, the, dutch, fleet, but, as, in, de, ruyter, s, fleet, many, of, the, others, were, small, armed, merchant, ships, rather, than, purpose, built, warships, on, the, afternoon, of, 16, august, 1652, ayscue, attempted, to, attack, and, capture, the, dutch, merchant, ships, with, around, nine, of, his, strongest, and, fastest, warships, but, de, ruyter, counter, attacked, leaving, the, convoy, unprotected, and, he, surrounded, those, english, warships, that, had, attacked, the, ensuing, m, l, e, battle, continued, until, nightfall, as, the, outnumbered, english, ships, could, rely, on, their, stronger, gun, batteries, to, keep, the, dutch, at, bay, most, of, the, hired, english, merchant, ships, neither, attempted, to, aid, their, warships, nor, pursue, the, dutch, merchant, ships, as, ayscue, was, defeated, in, his, aim, of, capturing, or, destroying, dutch, merchant, ships, and, as, de, ruyter, had, fought, off, an, attack, by, a, potentially, superior, force, by, a, bold, attack, on, its, strongest, ships, the, latter, had, won, this, battle, of, plymouth, and, saved, the, convoy, making, him, an, instant, naval, hero, to, the, dutch, population, he, also, fought, as, squadron, commander, at, the, battle, of, kentish, knock, and, the, battle, of, the, gabbard, during, this, war, tromp, s, death, during, the, battle, of, scheveningen, ended, the, war, de, ruyter, declined, an, emphatic, offer, from, johan, de, witt, to, assume, supreme, command, because, he, considered, himself, unfit, and, also, feared, that, it, would, bring, him, into, conflict, with, witte, de, with, and, johan, evertsen, both, of, whom, had, more, seniority, later, de, ruyter, and, de, witt, became, personal, friends, colonel, jacob, van, wassenaer, obdam, then, became, the, new, dutch, supreme, commander, of, the, confederate, fleet, de, ruyter, at, first, refused, to, become, obdam, s, naval, counsellor, and, assistant, but, later, was, persuaded, by, de, witt, to, accept, and, remained, in, the, service, of, the, dutch, navy, in, that, post, until, he, accepted, an, offer, from, the, admiralty, of, amsterdam, to, become, their, vice, admiral, on, 2, march, 1654, he, relocated, with, his, family, to, that, city, in, 1655, in, july, 1655, de, ruyter, took, command, of, a, squadron, of, eight, ships, of, which, the, tijdverdrijf, pastime, was, his, flagship, and, set, out, for, the, mediterranean, with, 55, merchantmen, in, convoy, his, orders, were, to, protect, dutch, trade, interests, in, that, region, and, to, ransom, enslaved, christians, in, algiers, meeting, an, english, fleet, under, robert, blake, along, the, way, he, managed, to, avoid, an, incident, operating, off, the, barbary, coast, he, captured, several, infamous, corsairs, and, after, negotiating, a, peace, agreement, with, sal, de, ruyter, returned, home, in, may, 1656, the, same, month, the, states, general, becoming, ever, more, concerned, by, the, expansionary, plans, of, the, swedish, king, charles, x, decided, to, intervene, in, the, second, northern, war, by, sending, a, fleet, to, the, baltic, sea, the, swedes, had, controlled, this, area, since, charles, had, invaded, poland, and, claimed, the, polish, throne, de, ruyter, once, again, embarked, aboard, the, tijdverdrijf, arriving, at, the, resund, where, he, waited, for, obdam, to, arrive, on, 8, june, after, obdam, had, assumed, command, de, ruyter, and, the, dutch, fleet, sailed, to, relieve, the, besieged, city, of, danzig, on, 27, july, which, they, did, without, any, bloodshed, peace, was, signed, a, month, later, before, leaving, the, baltic, de, ruyter, and, other, flag, officers, were, granted, an, audience, by, frederick, iii, of, denmark, de, ruyter, took, a, liking, to, the, danish, king, who, later, became, a, friend, in, 1658, the, states, general, on, the, advice, of, a, leading, member, cornelis, de, graeff, one, of, the, mayors, of, amsterdam, decided, to, once, again, send, a, fleet, to, the, baltic, sea, to, protect, the, important, baltic, trade, and, to, aid, the, danes, against, swedish, aggression, which, had, continued, despite, a, peace, settlement, in, accordance, with, the, states, balance, of, power, political, approach, a, fleet, under, lieutenant, admiral, jacob, van, wassenaer, obdam, was, sent, without, de, ruyter, who, at, the, time, was, blockading, lisbon, on, 8, november, a, bloody, melee, took, place, the, battle, of, the, sound, which, resulted, in, a, dutch, victory, relieving, copenhagen, still, the, swedes, were, far, from, defeated, and, the, states, decided, to, continue, their, support, for, the, danes, de, ruyter, took, command, of, a, new, expeditionary, fleet, and, managed, to, liberate, nyborg, in, 1659, for, this, he, was, knighted, by, king, frederick, iii, of, denmark, from, 1661, to, 1663, de, ruyter, did, convoy, duty, in, the, mediterranean, in, 1664, a, year, before, the, second, anglo, dutch, war, began, robert, holmes, had, captured, several, dutch, west, india, company, trading, posts, and, ships, on, the, west, african, coast, seeking, to, forcibly, expel, dutch, influence, from, the, region, although, johan, de, witt, wanted, to, avoid, an, all, out, war, with, england, he, considered, that, this, provocation, must, be, responded, to, and, proposed, to, the, states, general, that, de, ruyter, s, squadron, in, the, mediterranean, should, be, sent, to, west, africa, to, retake, the, west, india, company, s, forts, there, de, ruyter, received, his, instructions, at, m, laga, on, 1, september, 1664, and, by, early, the, next, month, all, the, dutch, west, african, posts, had, been, recaptured, and, the, squadron, was, ready, to, cross, the, atlantic, to, attack, english, shipping, in, the, west, indies, and, at, the, newfoundland, fisheries, in, reprisal, de, ruyter, s, activities, in, the, american, waters, had, less, satisfactory, results, than, those, off, west, africa, arriving, off, barbados, in, the, caribbean, at, the, end, of, april, 1665, aboard, his, flagship, spiegel, directly, translating, to, mirror, but, in, dutch, use, may, also, refer, to, the, transom, or, more, simply, the, rear, of, a, ship, he, led, his, fleet, of, thirteen, vessels, into, carlisle, bay, exchanging, fire, with, the, english, batteries, and, destroying, many, of, the, vessels, anchored, there, unable, to, silence, the, english, guns, and, having, sustained, significant, casualties, and, considerable, damage, to, his, vessels, he, retired, to, french, martinique, for, repairs, sailing, north, from, martinique, de, ruyter, captured, several, english, vessels, and, delivered, supplies, to, the, dutch, colony, at, sint, eustatius, in, view, of, the, damage, that, his, ships, had, sustained, at, barbados, he, decided, against, an, assault, on, new, york, formerly, new, amsterdam, which, would, have, been, necessary, had, the, dutch, wished, to, retake, their, former, new, netherland, colony, de, ruyter, then, proceeded, to, newfoundland, capturing, some, english, merchant, ships, and, temporarily, taking, the, town, of, st, john, s, before, returning, to, europe, travelling, around, the, north, of, scotland, as, a, precaution, in, december, 1664, the, english, fleet, attacked, the, dutch, smyrna, fleet, although, the, attack, failed, the, dutch, in, january, 1665, allowed, their, ships, to, open, fire, on, english, warships, when, threatened, war, was, declared, by, the, dutch, on, 4, march, 1665, following, two, further, english, attacks, on, dutch, convoys, one, off, cadiz, and, another, in, the, english, channel, the, dutch, fleet, was, confident, of, victory, but, it, contained, a, significant, proportion, of, older, or, weak, ships, in, the, first, year, of, the, second, anglo, dutch, war, at, the, battle, of, lowestoft, on, 13, june, 1665, the, dutch, suffered, the, worst, defeat, in, the, history, the, dutch, republic, s, navy, at, least, sixteen, ships, were, lost, and, one, third, of, its, personnel, captured, or, killed, van, wassenaer, was, among, the, dead, on, his, return, to, the, republic, de, ruyter, learned, van, wassenaer, had, been, killed, at, lowestoft, cornelis, tromp, had, been, put, in, temporary, command, of, the, confederate, fleet, after, the, battle, but, was, not, acceptable, to, the, regime, of, johan, de, witt, because, of, his, support, for, the, orangist, cause, de, ruyter, was, politically, neutral, but, on, friendly, terms, with, johan, de, witt, and, his, associates, his, successes, in, distant, waters, which, ensured, he, was, not, involved, in, the, battle, of, lowestoft, and, tainted, by, that, defeat, made, him, the, obvious, candidate, to, succeed, van, wassenaer, as, commander, of, the, dutch, fleet, which, he, did, on, 11, august, 1665, he, was, therefore, made, lieutenant, admiral, a, rank, he, would, in, 1666, share, with, five, others, in, the, dutch, admiralties, of, rotterdam, a, position, traditionally, reserved, for, the, bevelhebber, van, s, landts, vloot, the, supreme, operational, commander, in, the, second, year, of, the, war, 1666, de, ruyter, won, the, hard, fought, four, days, battle, of, 1, to, 4, june, 1666, the, division, of, the, english, fleet, gave, the, dutch, the, advantage, of, numbers, on, the, first, and, second, days, of, fighting, an, english, attack, on, the, anchored, dutch, fleet, on, the, first, day, was, resisted, and, after, two, days, fighting, the, english, fleet, retreated, towards, the, thames, however, the, english, fleet, was, reinforced, by, a, squadron, of, undamaged, ships, on, the, third, evening, and, fought, strongly, on, the, fourth, day, so, that, tromp, seemed, near, to, defeat, in, the, afternoon, until, de, ruyter, decided, the, battle, with, a, surprise, all, out, attack, that, demoralised, his, opponents, into, retreat, however, the, english, fleet, was, not, destroyed, and, on, 4, and, 5, august, the, dutch, suffered, heavy, manpower, losses, and, narrowly, escaped, disaster, in, the, st, james, s, day, battle, after, the, battle, de, ruyter, accused, cornelis, tromp, of, ignoring, the, main, english, attack, on, the, dutch, fleet, preferring, to, chase, the, english, rear, squadron, as, far, as, the, coast, which, eventually, led, to, tromp, s, dismissal, de, ruyter, then, became, seriously, ill, recovering, just, in, time, to, take, nominal, command, of, the, fleet, executing, the, raid, on, the, medway, in, 1667, the, third, year, of, the, war, the, medway, raid, was, part, of, a, broader, plan, by, johan, de, witt, to, land, dutch, troops, in, kent, or, essex, and, de, ruyter, neither, agreed, with, de, witt, s, fixation, with, the, thames, estuary, as, the, critical, theatre, of, the, naval, war, nor, with, this, raid, the, medway, raid, was, a, costly, and, embarrassing, defeat, for, the, english, resulting, in, the, loss, of, the, english, flagship, hms, royal, charles, and, effectively, ended, the, war, in, favour, of, the, dutch, a, planned, dutch, attack, on, the, english, anchorage, at, harwich, led, by, de, ruyter, had, to, be, abandoned, after, the, battle, of, landguard, fort, at, the, close, of, the, war, the, peace, of, breda, brought, the, war, to, an, end, between, 1667, and, 1671, de, ruyter, was, forbidden, by, de, witt, to, sail, so, as, not, to, endanger, his, life, in, 1669, a, failed, attempt, on, his, life, was, made, by, a, tromp, supporter, who, tried, to, stab, him, with, a, bread, knife, in, the, entrance, hall, of, his, house, the, treaty, of, breda, which, ended, the, second, anglo, dutch, war, in, july, 1667, failed, to, remove, the, root, causes, of, the, long, standing, anglo, dutch, rivalry, which, included, colonial, quarrels, including, the, exclusion, of, the, english, traders, from, dutch, colonies, and, the, english, occupation, of, the, former, dutch, new, netherland, colony, and, english, enforcement, of, the, navigation, act, although, tensions, between, the, two, nations, lessened, between, 1668, and, 1670, the, desire, of, louis, xiv, to, acquire, all, or, a, substantial, part, of, the, spanish, netherlands, and, neutralise, the, dutch, republic, led, to, his, subsidising, charles, ii, and, to, an, unprovoked, and, unsuccessful, english, attack, on, the, dutch, smyrna, fleet, in, march, 1672, an, english, declaration, of, war, against, the, netherlands, in, the, same, month, began, the, third, anglo, dutch, war, and, this, was, followed, by, a, french, declaration, of, war, against, the, dutch, in, may, 1672, shortly, thereafter, a, combined, anglo, french, fleet, was, formed, commanded, by, james, duke, of, york, the, lord, high, admiral, of, england, with, 62, major, warships, and, jean, comte, d, estr, es, with, 30, major, warships, forming, the, van, squadron, the, dutch, were, surprised, by, these, events, but, eventually, managed, to, prepare, a, strong, fleet, of, 75, ships, under, de, ruyter, however, because, delays, in, his, fleet, mustering, he, was, unable, to, realise, his, plan, of, preventing, the, junction, of, the, english, and, french, fleets, to, create, a, force, superior, to, his, so, he, used, three, different, strategies, to, meet, changing, situations, in, the, following, two, years, firstly, he, aimed, to, inflict, sufficient, damage, on, the, english, ships, to, require, their, lengthy, repairs, in, the, congested, english, dockyards, as, in, his, attack, at, solebay, allied, to, this, when, de, ruyter, detected, the, french, fleet, s, reluctance, to, become, involved, in, close, quarters, fighting, he, detached, small, squadrons, in, each, major, sea, battle, to, keep, the, french, out, of, the, main, action, concentrating, his, attack, on, the, english, fleet, with, only, slightly, inferior, numbers, thirdly, he, used, the, shelter, of, the, shoals, which, the, larger, of, the, allied, ships, had, to, avoid, as, a, safe, haven, keeping, the, dutch, fleet, intact, until, he, could, attack, the, allied, fleet, at, a, time, and, under, conditions, of, his, own, choosing, in, this, way, he, prevented, the, english, and, french, fleets, from, creating, the, conditions, needed, to, land, an, invasion, force, after, initially, withdrawing, into, shoal, waters, near, the, netherlands, coast, until, the, combined, anglo, french, fleet, retired, to, replenish, its, water, de, ruyter, attacked, its, 92, ships, on, 7, june, 1672, at, the, battle, of, solebay, the, dutch, fleet, concentrated, on, the, english, rear, squadron, while, the, french, van, of, 30, ships, steered, away, from, the, main, action, engaging, only, in, long, range, fire, with, the, 10, major, and, five, small, dutch, ships, of, adriaen, banckert, s, squadron, from, the, admiralty, of, zeeland, although, the, battle, was, tactically, indecisive, it, disrupted, anglo, french, plans, to, blockade, dutch, ports, and, land, soldiers, on, the, dutch, coast, and, also, created, dissention, between, the, allies, so, was, a, strategic, victory, for, de, ruyter, d, estr, es, was, condemned, both, by, the, english, fleet, and, some, of, his, own, officers, for, steering, away, from, the, dutch, and, failing, to, engage, them, closely, the, war, on, land, went, badly, for, the, dutch, in, 1672, which, they, called, the, rampjaar, or, disaster, year, and, this, led, to, the, resignation, and, then, murder, of, johan, de, witt, in, august, 1672, and, the, replacement, of, republicans, by, orangists, de, ruyter, was, saddened, by, the, killings, of, his, friends, de, witt, and, his, brother, but, agreed, to, continue, serving, as, commander, of, the, fleet, he, made, an, attempt, to, blockade, the, english, fleet, in, the, thames, with, 30, ships, in, may, 1673, but, it, had, already, put, to, sea, so, he, decided, to, rendezvous, with, the, rest, of, the, dutch, fleet, in, the, coastal, waters, of, the, schooneveld, where, by, late, may, he, had, assembled, a, fleet, of, 50, large, ships, together, with, frigates, and, fireships, 64, in, total, these, restricted, waters, neutralised, the, numerical, advantages, of, the, allied, fleet, which, had, 81, ships, of, the, line, and, several, frigates, in, the, two, battles, of, the, schooneveld, of, 1673, he, manoeuvered, skillfully, to, damage, the, allied, fleets, sufficiently, to, force, them, to, end, their, blockade, of, dutch, ports, finally, at, the, battle, of, texel, in, august, that, year, de, ruyter, s, smaller, fleet, prevented, the, larger, allied, fleet, landing, troops, on, the, dutch, coast, and, forced, it, to, retreat, after, the, battle, of, texel, d, estr, es, was, accused, by, prince, rupert, of, the, rhine, commanding, the, english, fleet, of, betraying, it, by, fighting, at, long, range, against, no, more, than, ten, dutch, ships, d, estr, es, admitted, later, that, louis, xiv, had, ordered, him, to, protect, the, french, fleet, in, case, england, should, make, peace, with, the, dutch, the, new, rank, of, lieutenant, admiral, general, was, created, especially, for, de, ruyter, in, february, 1673, when, the, new, stadtholder, of, holland, and, zeeland, william, iii, of, orange, became, admiral, general, although, successive, princes, of, orange, when, stadtholder, generally, commanded, the, dutch, army, in, person, as, its, captain, general, they, never, took, command, of, the, dutch, fleet, as, admiral, general, by, the, end, of, 1673, english, popular, opposition, to, the, war, and, to, the, french, alliance, the, changes, in, government, policy, and, the, likelihood, that, parliament, would, not, continue, to, provide, war, funding, inclined, charles, ii, towards, peace, with, holland, and, ending, his, alliance, with, france, after, relatively, brief, negotiations, the, treaty, of, westminster, ending, the, war, was, ratified, in, march, 1674, the, english, withdrawal, did, not, end, naval, engagements, in, the, franco, dutch, war, as, louis, xiv, did, not, wish, to, send, his, main, fleet, against, the, more, powerful, dutch, de, ruyter, was, first, instructed, to, use, his, fleet, in, support, in, a, descent, on, the, french, channel, and, biscay, coasts, in, which, the, appearance, of, the, fleet, would, create, a, threat, of, landings, or, an, invasion, aiming, to, divert, french, forces, from, the, spanish, netherlands, and, the, rhine, in, a, further, attempt, to, relieve, pressure, on, the, netherlands, he, was, next, ordered, to, take, the, fight, against, the, french, to, the, caribbean, he, arrived, off, fort, royal, martinique, aboard, his, flagship, de, zeven, provinci, n, on, 19, july, 1674, leading, a, substantial, force, of, eighteen, warships, nine, storeships, and, fifteen, troop, transports, bearing, 3, 400, soldiers, however, although, his, destination, was, supposed, to, be, secret, news, had, leaked, out, and, had, been, sent, to, the, french, governor, which, allowed, the, greatly, outnumbered, french, defenders, time, to, prepare, a, strong, defensive, position, when, the, dutch, troops, went, ashore, the, next, day, to, attempt, an, assault, on, fort, royal, they, suffered, significant, casualties, in, their, attempt, to, reach, the, french, fortifications, including, the, loss, of, most, of, their, senior, officers, and, they, returned, to, the, fleet, with, 143, killed, and, 318, wounded, compared, to, only, 15, french, defenders, lost, with, the, element, of, surprise, lost, and, with, disease, spreading, aboard, his, ships, de, ruyter, decided, against, further, attacks, and, returned, to, europe, in, july, 1674, the, messina, revolt, broke, against, spanish, rule, and, the, people, of, messina, asked, for, french, protection, a, small, french, squadron, was, sent, there, in, september, 1674, but, it, withdrew, before, the, year, end, in, the, face, of, a, more, numerous, spanish, force, a, stronger, french, force, and, supply, convoy, managed, to, break, through, the, spanish, blockade, and, defeat, the, more, numerous, spanish, fleet, in, a, battle, off, the, lipari, islands, on, 11, february, 1675, ending, the, spanish, blockade, of, messina, so, the, spanish, then, asked, for, dutch, assistance, de, ruyter, was, sent, to, the, mediterranean, later, in, 1675, with, eighteen, larger, warships, and, a, number, of, smaller, vessels, although, these, vessels, were, not, fully, manned, de, ruyter, thought, the, force, that, had, been, provided, was, insufficient, for, the, task, and, the, shortage, of, money, to, repair, damaged, ships, or, build, new, ones, or, to, recruit, and, pay, sufficient, sailors, as, the, war, continued, was, now, a, major, problem, for, the, dutch, fleet, after, a, delay, of, two, months, on, the, spanish, coast, waiting, for, the, supplies, and, a, supporting, squadron, promised, by, the, spanish, authorities, de, ruyter, sailed, for, sicily, at, the, year, end, with, only, one, spanish, ship, added, to, his, fleet, of, 18, dutch, warships, when, he, arrived, in, sicily, in, early, january, 1676, most, of, the, larger, french, warships, were, absent, from, messina, with, duquesne, who, was, escorting, a, reprovisioning, convoy, to, sicily, and, only, some, smaller, french, ships, remained, at, messina, however, de, ruyter, was, unable, to, attack, the, city, because, of, contrary, winds, and, on, 7, january, 1676, while, cruising, near, the, lipari, islands, and, accompanied, by, several, spanish, galleys, he, encountered, the, french, fleet, led, by, duquesne, the, convoy, although, both, fleets, had, similar, numbers, of, ships, the, french, fleet, was, more, powerful, with, 1, 500, guns, against, 1, 200, for, the, dutch, and, no, fighting, took, place, on, 7, january, when, de, ruyter, held, the, weather, gauge, however, the, wind, strengthened, overnight, forcing, the, spanish, galleys, to, seek, shelter, and, veered, to, a, west, southwesterly, direction, that, favoured, the, french, duquesne, therefore, sent, the, convoy, ahead, and, prepared, to, attack, the, dutch, during, the, battle, of, stromboli, on, 8, january, 1676, duquesne, s, ships, steered, obliquely, towards, the, dutch, fleet, which, exposed, them, to, dutch, broadside, fire, de, ruyter, s, van, and, centre, maintained, their, distance, by, gradually, giving, way, keeping, their, french, opponents, under, heavy, gunfire, and, causing, significant, damage, and, casualties, the, french, van, squadron, was, disordered, and, two, of, its, ships, had, to, pull, out, of, line, of, battle, until, duquesne, managed, to, restore, order, he, then, tried, several, times, to, break, the, dutch, line, although, de, ruyter, s, close, linear, formation, and, the, weight, of, dutch, broadsides, prevented, this, after, several, hours, fighting, the, wind, had, become, very, light, and, the, french, ceased, their, attacks, de, ruyter, disengaged, and, took, his, fleet, into, milazzo, with, three, badly, damaged, ships, towed, there, by, spanish, galleys, he, had, successfully, defended, his, inferior, fleet, in, a, tactically, disadvantageous, leeward, position, and, inflicted, significant, damage, on, the, french, fleet, during, the, night, the, wind, strengthened, again, and, duquesne, was, joined, by, eight, ships, from, messina, but, the, next, day, the, spanish, squadron, was, sighted, and, duquesne, did, not, wish, to, fight, an, action, against, superior, numbers, in, the, straits, of, messina, so, he, took, his, convoy, right, around, sicily, bringing, it, into, messina, without, further, fighting, the, combined, dutch, spanish, fleet, sailed, to, palermo, for, repairs, and, there, were, no, further, fleet, actions, for, several, months, after, the, battle, of, stromboli, de, ruyter, was, joined, by, a, spanish, squadron, and, relinquished, command, of, the, combined, fleet, to, the, spanish, admiral, don, francisco, de, la, cerda, in, order, to, attack, messina, the, allies, had, to, defeat, the, french, fleet, and, they, decided, to, attack, augusta, to, force, the, french, warships, to, leave, messina, harbour, the, attack, on, augusta, had, the, desired, effect, and, on, 22, april, 1676, the, two, fleets, met, north, of, augusta, de, ruyter, commanded, the, van, squadron, the, spanish, ships, formed, the, centre, with, another, dutch, squadrons, in, the, van, rear, there, were, 29, french, ships, of, the, line, and, 13, dutch, warships, not, all, fit, to, fight, in, line, jenkins, mentions, between, ten, and, fourteen, spanish, warships, besides, frigates, and, fireships, supporting, the, dutch, and, the, french, fleet, was, superior, in, firepower, as, well, as, numbers, the, battle, largely, consisted, of, a, fierce, fight, between, the, two, vans, as, the, spanish, centre, remained, at, long, range, from, its, french, counterpart, with, some, ships, in, the, rear, squadrons, also, engaging, each, other, the, inactivity, of, the, spanish, centre, enabled, the, leading, ships, of, duquesne, s, centre, to, attack, on, de, ruyter, s, outnumbered, van, squadron, although, the, dutch, withstood, these, attacks, and, de, ruyter, attacked, duquesne, s, ship, with, the, intention, of, boarding, it, but, was, prevented, when, two, french, ships, went, to, their, admiral, s, assistance, at, the, end, of, the, battle, de, ruyter, was, able, to, extract, his, squadron, by, his, own, seamanship, and, the, assistance, of, the, dutch, rear, squadron, during, the, course, of, the, dutch, van, squadron, s, disengagement, from, fighting, de, ruyter, was, fatally, wounded, when, a, cannonball, struck, him, in, the, leg, and, he, died, a, week, later, at, syracuse, it, is, recorded, that, his, french, opponents, honoured, him, by, firing, salutes, as, the, ship, carrying, his, embalmed, body, to, the, netherlands, passed, the, french, fleet, on, 18, march, 1677, de, ruyter, was, given, an, elaborate, state, funeral, on, that, occasion, the, amsterdam, professor, petrus, francius, recited, a, latin, farewell, poem, of, nearly, a, thousand, hexameters, his, body, was, buried, in, the, nieuwe, kerk, in, amsterdam, the, praal, tomb, completed, in, 1681, designed, and, created, by, the, flemish, sculptor, rombout, verhulst, is, on, display, in, the, nieuwe, kerk, he, was, succeeded, as, supreme, commander, by, cornelis, tromp, in, 1679, de, ruyter, was, highly, respected, by, his, sailors, and, soldiers, who, used, the, term, of, endearment, besteva, r, grandfather, for, him, both, because, of, his, disregard, for, hierarchy, as, he, was, himself, of, humble, origin, and, his, refusal, to, turn, away, from, risky, and, bold, undertakings, despite, his, usually, cautious, nature, he, is, honoured, by, a, statue, in, his, birthplace, vlissingen, which, stands, looking, over, the, sea,
