and, other, places, of, worship, they, are, used, particularly, in, paganism, christianity, buddhism, hinduism, judaism, modern, paganism, and, in, certain, islamic, communities, around, caucasia, and, asia, minor, many, historical, medieval, faiths, also, made, use, of, them, including, the, roman, greek, and, norse, religions, the, modern, english, word, altar, was, derived, from, middle, english, altar, from, old, english, alter, taken, from, latin, altare, altar, probably, related, to, adolere, burn, thus, burning, place, influenced, by, altus, high, it, displaced, the, native, old, english, word, w, ofod, altars, in, the, hebrew, bible, were, typically, made, of, earth, or, unwrought, stone, altars, were, generally, erected, in, conspicuous, places, the, first, altar, recorded, in, the, hebrew, bible, is, that, erected, by, noah, altars, were, erected, by, abraham, by, isaac, by, jacob, and, by, moses, after, the, theophany, on, mount, sinai, in, the, tabernacle, and, afterwards, in, the, temple, only, two, altars, were, used, the, altar, of, burnt, offering, and, the, altar, of, incense, both, near, where, the, ark, of, the, covenant, was, located, the, remains, of, three, rock, hewn, altars, were, discovered, in, the, land, of, israel, one, below, tel, zorah, another, at, the, foot, of, sebastia, ancient, samaria, and, a, third, near, shiloh, the, word, altar, in, greek, see, appears, twenty, four, times, in, the, new, testament, in, catholic, and, orthodox, christian, theology, the, eucharist, is, a, re, presentation, in, the, literal, sense, of, the, one, sacrifice, of, christ, on, the, cross, being, made, present, again, hence, the, table, upon, which, the, eucharist, is, consecrated, is, called, an, altar, the, altar, plays, a, central, role, in, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, which, takes, place, at, the, altar, on, which, the, bread, and, the, wine, for, consecration, are, placed, altars, occupy, a, prominent, place, in, most, christian, churches, both, eastern, and, western, branches, commonly, among, these, churches, altars, are, placed, for, permanent, use, within, designated, places, of, communal, worship, often, called, sanctuaries, less, often, though, nonetheless, notable, altars, are, set, in, spaces, occupied, less, regularly, such, as, outdoors, in, nature, in, cemeteries, in, mausoleums, crypts, and, family, dwellings, personal, altars, are, those, placed, in, a, private, bedroom, closet, or, other, space, usually, occupied, by, one, person, they, are, used, for, practices, of, piety, intended, for, one, person, often, referred, to, as, a, private, devotion, they, are, also, found, in, a, minority, of, protestant, worship, places, in, reformed, and, anabaptist, churches, a, table, often, called, a, communion, table, serves, an, analogous, function, the, area, around, the, altar, is, seen, as, endowed, with, greater, holiness, and, is, usually, physically, distinguished, from, the, rest, of, the, church, whether, by, a, permanent, structure, such, as, an, iconostasis, a, rood, screen, altar, rails, a, curtain, that, can, be, closed, at, more, solemn, moments, of, the, liturgy, as, in, the, armenian, apostolic, church, and, armenian, catholic, church, or, simply, by, the, general, architectural, layout, the, altar, is, often, on, a, higher, elevation, than, the, rest, of, the, church, churches, generally, have, a, single, altar, although, in, the, western, branches, of, christianity, as, a, result, of, the, former, abandonment, of, concelebration, of, mass, so, that, priests, always, celebrated, mass, individually, larger, churches, have, had, one, or, more, side, chapels, each, with, its, own, altar, the, main, altar, was, also, referred, to, as, the, high, altar, since, the, revival, of, concelebration, in, the, west, the, roman, missal, recommends, that, in, new, churches, there, should, be, only, one, altar, which, in, the, gathering, of, the, faithful, will, signify, the, one, christ, and, the, one, eucharist, of, the, church, this, does, not, exclude, altars, in, distinct, side, chapels, however, but, only, separate, altars, in, the, main, body, of, the, church, but, most, western, churches, of, an, earlier, period, whether, roman, catholic, or, anglican, may, have, a, high, altar, in, the, main, body, of, the, church, with, one, or, more, adjoining, chapels, each, with, its, own, altar, at, which, the, eucharist, may, be, celebrated, on, weekdays, architecturally, there, are, two, types, of, altars, those, that, are, attached, to, the, eastern, wall, of, the, chancel, and, those, that, are, free, standing, and, can, be, walked, around, for, instance, when, incensing, the, altar, in, the, earliest, days, of, the, church, the, eucharist, appears, to, have, been, celebrated, on, portable, altars, set, up, for, the, purpose, some, historians, hold, that, during, the, persecutions, the, eucharist, was, celebrated, among, the, tombs, in, the, catacombs, of, rome, using, the, sarcophagi, of, martyrs, as, altars, on, which, to, celebrate, other, historians, dispute, this, but, it, is, thought, to, be, the, origin, of, the, tradition, of, placing, relics, beneath, the, altar, when, christianity, was, legalized, under, constantine, the, great, and, licinius, formal, church, buildings, were, built, in, great, numbers, normally, with, free, standing, altars, in, the, middle, of, the, sanctuary, which, in, all, the, earliest, churches, built, in, rome, was, at, the, west, end, of, the, church, when, christians, in, fourth, century, rome, could, first, freely, begin, to, build, churches, they, customarily, located, the, sanctuary, towards, the, west, end, of, the, building, in, imitation, of, the, sanctuary, of, the, jerusalem, temple, although, in, the, days, of, the, jerusalem, temple, the, high, priest, indeed, faced, east, when, sacrificing, on, yom, kippur, the, sanctuary, within, which, he, stood, was, located, at, the, western, end, of, the, temple, the, christian, replication, of, the, layout, and, the, orientation, of, the, jerusalem, temple, helped, to, dramatize, the, eschatological, meaning, attached, to, the, sacrificial, death, of, jesus, the, high, priest, in, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, the, ministers, bishop, priests, deacons, subdeacons, acolytes, celebrated, the, eucharist, facing, east, towards, the, entrance, some, hold, that, for, the, central, part, of, the, celebration, the, congregation, faced, the, same, way, after, the, sixth, century, the, contrary, orientation, prevailed, with, the, entrance, to, the, west, and, the, altar, at, the, east, end, then, the, ministers, and, congregation, all, faced, east, during, the, whole, celebration, and, in, western, europe, altars, began, in, the, middle, ages, to, be, permanently, placed, against, the, east, wall, of, the, chancel, most, rubrics, even, in, books, of, the, seventeenth, century, and, later, such, as, the, pontificale, romanum, continued, to, envisage, the, altar, as, free, standing, the, rite, of, the, dedication, of, the, church, continued, to, presume, that, the, officiating, bishop, could, circle, the, altar, during, the, consecration, of, the, church, and, its, altar, despite, this, with, the, increase, in, the, size, and, importance, of, the, reredos, most, altars, were, built, against, the, wall, or, barely, separated, from, it, in, almost, all, cases, the, eastward, orientation, for, prayer, was, maintained, whether, the, altar, was, at, the, west, end, of, the, church, as, in, all, the, earliest, churches, in, rome, in, which, case, the, priest, celebrating, mass, faced, the, congregation, and, the, church, entrance, or, whether, it, was, at, the, east, end, of, the, church, in, which, case, the, priest, faced, the, eastern, apse, and, had, his, back, to, the, congregation, this, diversity, was, recognized, in, the, rubrics, of, the, roman, missal, from, the, 1604, typical, edition, of, pope, clement, viii, to, the, 1962, edition, of, pope, john, xxiii, si, altare, sit, ad, orientem, versus, populum, when, placed, close, to, a, wall, or, touching, it, altars, were, often, surmounted, by, a, reredos, or, altarpiece, if, free, standing, they, could, be, placed, as, also, in, eastern, christianity, within, a, ciborium, sometimes, called, a, baldachin, the, rules, regarding, the, present, day, form, of, the, roman, rite, liturgy, declare, a, free, standing, main, altar, to, be, desirable, wherever, possible, similarly, in, the, anglican, communion, the, rubrics, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, assumed, an, altar, fixed, against, the, wall, until, prayer, book, revision, in, the, twentieth, century, removed, language, which, assumed, any, particular, form, of, altar, as, well, as, altars, in, the, structural, sense, it, became, customary, in, the, west, to, have, what, in, latin, were, referred, to, as, altaria, portatilia, portable, altars, more, commonly, referred, to, in, english, as, altar, stones, when, travelling, a, priest, could, take, one, with, him, and, place, it, on, an, ordinary, table, for, saying, mass, they, were, also, inserted, into, the, centre, of, structural, altars, especially, those, made, of, wood, in, that, case, it, was, the, altar, stone, that, was, considered, liturgically, to, be, the, altar, the, pontificale, romanum, contained, a, rite, for, blessing, at, the, same, time, several, of, these, altar, stones, in, the, east, the, antimension, served, and, continues, to, serve, the, same, purpose, the, term, movable, altar, or, portable, altar, is, now, used, of, a, full, scale, structural, altar, with, or, without, an, inserted, altar, stone, that, can, be, moved, 298, movable, altars, include, the, free, standing, wooden, tables, without, altar, stone, placed, in, the, choir, away, from, the, east, wall, favoured, by, churches, in, the, reformed, tradition, altars, that, not, only, can, be, moved, but, are, repeatedly, moved, are, found, in, low, church, traditions, that, do, not, focus, worship, on, the, eucharist, celebrating, it, rarely, both, catholics, and, protestants, celebrate, the, eucharist, at, such, altars, outside, of, churches, and, chapels, as, outdoors, or, in, an, auditorium, the, eastern, catholic, churches, each, follow, their, own, traditions, which, in, general, correspond, to, those, of, similar, eastern, orthodox, or, oriental, orthodox, churches, all, christian, churches, see, the, altar, on, which, the, eucharist, is, offered, as, the, table, of, the, lord, trapeza, kyriou, mentioned, by, saint, paul, the, rules, indicated, here, are, those, of, the, latin, church, the, latin, church, distinguishes, between, fixed, altars, those, attached, to, the, floor, and, movable, altars, those, that, can, be, displaced, and, states, it, is, desirable, that, in, every, church, there, be, a, fixed, altar, since, this, more, clearly, and, permanently, signifies, christ, jesus, the, living, stone, in, other, places, set, aside, for, sacred, celebrations, the, altar, may, be, movable, 298, a, fixed, altar, should, in, general, be, topped, by, a, slab, of, natural, stone, thus, conforming, to, tradition, and, to, the, significance, attributed, to, the, altar, but, in, many, places, dignified, well, crafted, solid, wood, is, permitted, the, supports, or, base, of, a, fixed, altar, may, be, of, any, dignified, solid, material, a, movable, altar, may, be, of, any, noble, solid, material, suitable, for, liturgical, use, 301, the, liturgical, norms, state, this, last, norm, explicitly, excludes, the, practice, customary, in, recent, centuries, of, inserting, relics, into, a, specially, created, cavity, within, the, table, of, an, altar, or, altar, stone, placing, of, relics, even, in, the, base, of, a, movable, altar, is, also, excluded, in, building, new, churches, it, is, preferable, for, a, single, altar, to, be, erected, one, that, in, the, gathering, of, the, faithful, will, signify, the, one, christ, and, the, one, eucharist, of, the, church, in, already, existing, churches, however, when, the, old, altar, is, so, positioned, that, it, makes, the, people, s, participation, difficult, but, cannot, be, moved, without, damage, to, artistic, value, another, fixed, altar, skillfully, made, and, properly, dedicated, should, be, erected, and, the, sacred, rites, celebrated, on, it, alone, in, order, that, the, attention, of, the, faithful, not, be, distracted, from, the, new, altar, the, old, altar, should, not, be, decorated, in, any, special, way, 303, the, altar, fixed, or, movable, should, as, a, rule, be, separate, from, the, wall, so, as, to, make, it, easy, to, walk, around, it, and, to, celebrate, mass, at, it, facing, the, people, it, should, be, positioned, so, as, to, be, the, natural, centre, of, attention, of, the, whole, congregation, 299, the, altar, should, be, covered, by, at, least, one, white, cloth, and, nothing, else, should, be, placed, upon, the, altar, table, other, than, what, is, required, for, the, liturgical, celebration, candlesticks, and, a, crucifix, when, required, can, be, either, on, the, altar, or, near, it, and, it, is, desirable, that, the, crucifix, remain, even, outside, of, liturgical, celebrations, 304, 308, a, wide, variety, of, altars, exist, in, various, protestant, denominations, some, churches, such, as, the, lutheran, have, altars, very, similar, to, anglican, or, catholic, ones, keeping, with, their, more, sacramental, understanding, of, the, lord, s, supper, calvinist, churches, from, reformed, baptist, congregational, and, non, denominational, backgrounds, instead, have, a, communion, table, adorned, with, a, linen, cloth, as, well, as, an, open, bible, and, a, pair, of, candlesticks, it, is, not, referred, to, as, an, altar, because, they, do, not, see, holy, communion, as, sacrificial, in, any, way, such, a, table, may, be, temporary, moved, into, place, only, when, there, is, a, communion, service, some, nondenominational, churches, have, no, altar, or, communion, table, even, if, they, retain, the, practice, of, the, altar, call, that, originated, in, the, methodist, church, some, methodist, and, other, evangelical, churches, practice, what, is, referred, to, as, an, altar, call, whereby, those, who, wish, to, make, a, new, spiritual, commitment, to, jesus, christ, are, invited, to, come, forward, publicly, it, is, so, named, because, the, supplicants, at, the, end, of, the, sermon, kneel, at, the, altar, rails, which, are, located, around, the, altar, within, chancel, those, that, come, forward, will, often, recite, a, sinner, s, prayer, which, in, evangelical, understanding, if, truly, heart, felt, indicates, that, they, are, now, saved, they, may, also, be, offered, religious, literature, counselling, or, other, assistance, many, times, it, is, said, that, those, who, come, forth, are, going, to, be, saved, this, is, a, ritual, in, which, the, supplicant, makes, a, prayer, of, penitence, asking, for, his, sins, to, be, forgiven, and, faith, called, in, evangelical, christianity, accepting, jesus, christ, as, their, personal, lord, and, saviour, altars, in, lutheran, churches, are, often, similar, to, those, in, roman, catholic, and, anglican, churches, lutherans, believe, that, the, altar, represents, christ, and, should, only, be, used, to, consecrate, and, distribute, the, eucharist, lutheran, altars, are, commonly, made, out, of, granite, but, other, materials, are, also, used, a, crucifix, is, to, be, put, above, the, altar, sometimes, relics, are, also, placed, around, the, altar, altars, in, the, anglican, communion, vary, widely, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, the, basis, of, doctrine, and, practice, for, the, church, of, england, there, is, no, use, of, the, specific, word, altar, the, item, in, question, is, called, the, lord, s, table, or, holy, table, this, remains, the, official, terminology, though, common, usage, may, call, the, communion, table, an, altar, at, the, time, of, the, reformation, altars, were, fixed, against, the, east, end, of, the, church, and, the, priests, would, celebrate, the, mass, standing, at, the, front, of, the, altar, beginning, with, the, rubrics, of, the, second, prayer, book, of, edward, vi, published, in, 1552, and, through, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, which, prevailed, for, almost, 300, years, and, is, still, in, occasional, use, the, priest, is, directed, to, stand, at, the, north, syde, of, the, table, this, was, variously, interpreted, over, the, years, to, mean, the, north, side, of, the, front, of, a, fixed, communion, table, the, north, end, of, a, fixed, table, i, e, facing, south, the, north, side, of, a, free, standing, table, presumably, facing, those, intending, to, receive, the, elements, who, would, be, sitting, in, the, quire, stalls, opposite, or, at, the, north, end, of, a, free, standing, table, lengthwise, in, the, chancel, facing, a, congregation, seated, in, the, nave, often, where, a, celebrant, chose, to, situate, himself, was, meant, to, convey, his, churchmanship, that, is, more, reformed, or, more, catholic, the, use, of, candles, or, tabernacles, was, banned, by, canon, law, with, the, only, appointed, adornment, being, a, white, linen, cloth, beginning, with, the, oxford, movement, in, the, 19th, century, the, appearance, of, anglican, altars, took, a, dramatic, turn, in, many, churches, candles, and, in, some, cases, tabernacles, were, re, introduced, in, some, churches, two, candles, on, each, end, of, the, altar, were, used, in, other, cases, six, three, on, either, side, of, a, tabernacle, typically, surmounted, by, a, crucifix, or, some, other, image, of, christ, when, a, stone, altar, was, placed, in, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, cambridge, after, rebuilding, works, in, 1841, a, case, was, brought, in, the, court, of, arches, which, resulted, in, an, order, to, remove, it, and, replace, it, with, a, wooden, communion, table, in, anglican, practice, conformity, to, a, given, standard, depends, on, the, ecclesiastical, province, and, or, the, liturgical, sensibilities, of, a, given, parish, in, the, parson, s, handbook, an, influential, manual, for, priests, popular, in, the, early, to, mid, twentieth, century, percy, dearmer, recommends, that, all, altars, should, be, 3, ft, 3, in, high, and, at, least, deep, enough, to, take, a, corporal, 20, in, square, with, an, inch, or, two, to, spare, he, also, recommends, that, the, altar, stand, upon, three, steps, for, each, of, the, three, sacred, ministers, and, that, it, be, decorated, with, a, silk, frontal, in, the, seasonal, colour, in, some, cases, other, manuals, suggest, that, a, stone, be, set, in, the, top, of, wooden, altars, in, the, belief, that, the, custom, be, maintained, of, consecrating, the, bread, and, wine, on, a, stone, surface, in, many, other, anglican, parishes, the, custom, is, considerably, less, rigorous, especially, in, those, parishes, which, use, free, standing, altars, typically, these, altars, are, made, of, wood, and, may, or, may, not, have, a, solid, front, which, may, or, may, not, be, ornamented, in, many, anglican, parishes, the, use, of, frontals, has, persisted, when, altars, are, placed, away, from, the, wall, of, the, chancel, allowing, a, westward, orientation, only, two, candles, are, placed, on, either, end, of, it, since, six, would, obscure, the, liturgical, action, undermining, the, intent, of, a, westward, orientation, i, e, that, it, be, visible, to, the, congregation, in, such, an, arrangement, a, tabernacle, may, stand, to, one, side, of, or, behind, the, altar, or, an, aumbry, may, be, used, sensibilities, concerning, the, sanctity, of, the, altar, are, widespread, in, anglicanism, in, some, parishes, the, notion, that, the, surface, of, the, altar, should, only, be, touched, by, those, in, holy, orders, is, maintained, in, others, there, is, considerably, less, strictness, about, the, communion, table, nonetheless, the, continued, popularity, of, communion, rails, in, anglican, church, construction, suggests, that, a, sense, of, the, sanctity, of, the, altar, and, its, surrounding, area, persists, in, most, cases, moreover, the, practice, of, allowing, only, those, items, that, have, been, blessed, to, be, placed, on, the, altar, is, maintained, that, is, the, linen, cloth, candles, missal, and, the, eucharistic, vessels, in, greek, the, word, b, m, s, can, mean, an, altar, of, any, religion, or, in, a, broader, sense, the, area, surrounding, it, that, is, to, say, the, entire, sanctuary, in, an, eastern, orthodox, or, a, byzantine, rite, eastern, catholic, church, this, sanctuary, includes, both, the, area, behind, the, iconostasis, and, the, soleas, the, elevated, projection, in, front, of, the, iconostasis, and, the, ambo, it, is, also, called, the, bema, when, one, enters, the, sanctuary, one, is, said, to, be, going, into, the, or, the, altar, itself, in, such, a, church, may, be, referred, to, as, either, the, holy, table, greek, or, the, throne, chu, prest, l, for, both, eastern, orthodox, and, byzantine, eastern, catholics, the, holy, table, altar, is, normally, free, standing, although, in, very, small, sanctuaries, it, might, be, placed, flush, against, the, back, wall, for, reasons, of, space, they, are, typically, about, one, meter, high, and, although, they, may, be, made, of, stone, they, are, generally, built, out, of, wood, the, exact, dimensions, may, vary, but, it, is, generally, square, in, plan, and, in, reasonable, proportion, to, the, size, of, the, sanctuary, it, has, five, legs, one, at, each, corner, plus, a, central, pillar, for, supporting, the, relics, which, are, placed, in, it, at, its, consecration, a, plain, linen, covering, greek, katasarkion, slavonic, strach, tsa, is, bound, to, the, holy, table, with, cords, this, cover, is, never, removed, after, the, altar, is, consecrated, and, is, considered, to, be, the, baptismal, garment, of, the, altar, the, linen, covering, symbolizes, the, winding, sheet, in, which, the, body, of, christ, was, wrapped, when, he, was, laid, in, the, tomb, since, the, altar, is, never, seen, uncovered, thereafter, the, table, tends, to, be, constructed, more, with, sturdiness, than, aesthetics, in, mind, above, this,

comes, all, the, way, to, the, floor, and, represents, the, glory, of, god, s, throne, in, many, churches, it, is, the, custom, for, a, dust, cover, to, be, placed, on, the, holy, table, between, services, this, is, often, a, simple, red, cloth, though, it, may, be, made, of, richer, stuff, sometimes, it, covers, only, the, gospel, book, or, the, front, half, of, the, holy, table, but, it, may, be, large, enough, to, cover, the, entire, holy, table, and, everything, on, it, including, candlesticks, and, the, seven, branch, candelabra, atop, the, altar, is, the, tabernacle, kovtch, g, a,
