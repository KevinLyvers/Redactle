materialism, is, a, form, of, philosophical, monism, which, holds, that, matter, is, the, fundamental, substance, in, nature, and, that, all, things, including, mental, states, and, consciousness, are, results, of, material, interactions, of, material, things, according, to, philosophical, materialism, mind, and, consciousness, are, caused, by, physical, processes, such, as, the, neurochemistry, of, the, human, brain, and, nervous, system, without, which, they, cannot, exist, materialism, directly, contrasts, with, idealism, according, to, which, consciousness, is, the, fundamental, substance, of, nature, materialism, is, closely, related, to, physicalism, the, view, that, all, that, exists, is, ultimately, physical, philosophical, physicalism, has, evolved, from, materialism, with, the, theories, of, the, physical, sciences, to, incorporate, more, sophisticated, notions, of, physicality, than, mere, ordinary, matter, e, g, spacetime, physical, energies, and, forces, and, exotic, matter, thus, some, prefer, the, term, physicalism, to, materialism, while, others, use, the, terms, as, if, they, were, synonymous, discoveries, of, neural, correlates, between, consciousness, and, the, brain, are, taken, as, empirical, support, for, materialism, but, some, philosophers, of, mind, find, that, association, fallacious, or, consider, it, compatible, with, non, materialist, ideas, alternative, philosophies, opposed, or, alternative, to, materialism, or, physicalism, include, idealism, pluralism, dualism, panpsychism, and, other, forms, of, monism, epicureanism, is, a, philosophy, of, materialism, from, classical, antiquity, that, was, a, major, forerunner, of, modern, science, though, ostensibly, a, deist, epicurus, affirmed, the, literal, existence, of, the, greek, gods, in, either, some, type, of, celestial, heaven, cognate, from, which, they, ruled, the, universe, if, not, on, a, literal, mount, olympus, and, his, philosophy, promulgated, atomism, while, platonism, taught, roughly, the, opposite, despite, plato, s, teaching, of, zeus, as, god, materialism, belongs, to, the, class, of, monist, ontology, and, is, thus, different, from, ontological, theories, based, on, dualism, or, pluralism, for, singular, explanations, of, the, phenomenal, reality, materialism, is, in, contrast, to, idealism, neutral, monism, and, spiritualism, it, can, also, contrast, with, phenomenalism, vitalism, and, dual, aspect, monism, its, materiality, can, in, some, ways, be, linked, to, the, concept, of, determinism, as, espoused, by, enlightenment, thinkers, despite, the, large, number, of, philosophical, schools, and, their, nuances, all, philosophies, are, said, to, fall, into, one, of, two, primary, categories, defined, in, contrast, to, each, other, idealism, and, materialism, the, basic, proposition, of, these, two, categories, pertains, to, the, nature, of, reality, the, primary, difference, between, them, is, how, they, answer, two, fundamental, questions, what, reality, consists, of, and, how, it, originated, to, idealists, spirit, or, mind, or, the, objects, of, mind, ideas, are, primary, and, matter, secondary, to, materialists, matter, is, primary, and, mind, or, spirit, or, ideas, are, secondary, the, product, of, matter, acting, upon, matter, the, materialist, view, is, perhaps, best, understood, in, its, opposition, to, the, doctrines, of, immaterial, substance, applied, to, the, mind, historically, by, ren, descartes, by, itself, materialism, says, nothing, about, how, material, substance, should, be, characterized, in, practice, it, is, frequently, assimilated, to, one, variety, of, physicalism, or, another, modern, philosophical, materialists, extend, the, definition, of, other, scientifically, observable, entities, such, as, energy, forces, and, the, spacetime, continuum, some, philosophers, such, as, mary, midgley, suggest, that, the, concept, of, matter, is, elusive, and, poorly, defined, during, the, 19th, century, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, extended, the, concept, of, materialism, to, elaborate, a, materialist, conception, of, history, centered, on, the, roughly, empirical, world, of, human, activity, practice, including, labor, and, the, institutions, created, reproduced, or, destroyed, by, that, activity, they, also, developed, dialectical, materialism, by, taking, hegelian, dialectics, stripping, them, of, their, idealist, aspects, and, fusing, them, with, materialism, see, modern, philosophy, materialism, is, often, associated, with, reductionism, according, to, which, the, objects, or, phenomena, individuated, at, one, level, of, description, if, they, are, genuine, must, be, explicable, in, terms, of, the, objects, or, phenomena, at, some, other, level, of, description, typically, at, a, more, reduced, level, non, reductive, materialism, explicitly, rejects, this, notion, taking, the, material, constitution, of, all, particulars, to, be, consistent, with, the, existence, of, real, objects, properties, or, phenomena, not, explicable, in, the, terms, canonically, used, for, the, basic, material, constituents, jerry, fodor, held, this, view, according, to, which, empirical, laws, and, explanations, in, special, sciences, like, psychology, or, geology, are, invisible, from, the, perspective, of, basic, physics, materialism, developed, possibly, independently, in, several, geographically, separated, regions, of, eurasia, during, what, karl, jaspers, termed, the, axial, age, c, 800, 200, bc, in, ancient, indian, philosophy, materialism, developed, around, 600, bc, with, the, works, of, ajita, kesakambali, payasi, kanada, and, the, proponents, of, the, c, rv, ka, school, of, philosophy, kanada, became, one, of, the, early, proponents, of, atomism, the, nyaya, vaisesika, school, c, 600, 100, bc, developed, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, atomism, although, their, proofs, of, god, and, their, positing, that, consciousness, was, not, material, precludes, labelling, them, as, materialists, buddhist, atomism, and, the, jaina, school, continued, the, atomic, tradition, ancient, greek, atomists, like, leucippus, democritus, and, epicurus, prefigure, later, materialists, the, latin, poem, de, rerum, natura, by, lucretius, 99, c, 55, bc, reflects, the, mechanistic, philosophy, of, democritus, and, epicurus, according, to, this, view, all, that, exists, is, matter, and, void, and, all, phenomena, result, from, different, motions, and, conglomerations, of, base, material, particles, called, atoms, literally, indivisibles, de, rerum, natura, provides, mechanistic, explanations, for, phenomena, such, as, erosion, evaporation, wind, and, sound, famous, principles, like, nothing, can, touch, body, but, body, first, appeared, in, lucretius, s, work, democritus, and, epicurus, did, not, espouse, a, monist, ontology, instead, espousing, the, ontological, separation, of, matter, and, space, i, e, that, space, is, another, kind, of, being, wang, chong, 27, c, 100, ad, was, a, chinese, thinker, of, the, early, common, era, said, to, be, a, materialist, later, indian, materialist, jayaraashi, bhatta, 6th, century, in, his, work, tattvopaplavasimha, the, upsetting, of, all, principles, refuted, the, ny, ya, s, tra, epistemology, the, materialistic, c, rv, ka, philosophy, appears, to, have, died, out, some, time, after, 1400, when, madhavacharya, compiled, sarva, dar, ana, samgraha, a, digest, of, all,

1592, 1665, represented, the, materialist, tradition, in, opposition, to, the, attempts, of, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, to, provide, the, natural, sciences, with, dualist, foundations, there,

philosophical, poetry, of, william, wordsworth, 1770, 1850, in, late, modern, philosophy, german, atheist, anthropologist, ludwig, feuerbach, signaled, a, new, turn, in, materialism, in, his, 1841, book, the, essence, of, christianity, which, presented, a, humanist, account, of, religion, as, the, outward, projection, of, man, s, inward, nature, feuerbach, introduced, anthropological, materialism, a, version, of, materialism, that, views, materialist, anthropology, as, the, universal, science, feuerbach, s, variety, of, materialism, heavily, influenced, karl, marx, who, in, the, late, 19th, century, elaborated, the, concept, of, historical, materialism, the, basis, for, what, marx, and, friedrich, engels, outlined, as, scientific, socialism, the, materialist, conception, of, history, starts, from, the, proposition, that, the, production, of, the, means, to, support, human, life, and, next, to, production, the, exchange, of, things, produced, is, the, basis, of, all, social, structure, that, in, every, society, that, has, appeared, in, history, the, manner, in, which, wealth, is, distributed, and, society, divided, into, classes, or, orders, is, dependent, upon, what, is, produced, how, it, is, produced, and, how, the, products, are, exchanged, from, this, point, of, view, the, final, causes, of, all, social, changes, and, political, revolutions, are, to, be, sought, not, in, men, s, brains, not, in, men, s, better, insights, into, eternal, truth, and, justice, but, in, changes, in, the, modes, of, production, and, exchange, they, are, to, be, sought, not, in, the, philosophy, but, in, the, economics, of, each, particular, epoch, through, his, dialectics, of, nature, 1883, engels, later, developed, a, materialist, dialectic, philosophy, of, nature, a, worldview, that, georgi, plekhanov, the, father, of, russian, marxism, called, dialectical, materialism, in, early, 20th, century, russian, philosophy, vladimir, lenin, further, developed, dialectical, materialism, in, his, 1909, book, materialism, and, empirio, criticism, which, connects, his, opponents, political, conceptions, to, their, anti, materialist, philosophies, a, more, naturalist, oriented, materialist, school, of, thought, that, developed, in, the, mid, 19th, century, was, german, materialism, which, included, ludwig, b, chner, 1824, 1899, the, dutch, born, jacob, moleschott, 1822, 1893, and, carl, vogt, 1817, 1895, even, though, they, had, different, views, on, core, issues, such, as, the, evolution, and, the, origins, of, life, contemporary, analytic, philosophers, e, g, daniel, dennett, willard, van, orman, quine, donald, davidson, and, jerry, fodor, operate, within, a, broadly, physicalist, or, scientific, materialist, framework, producing, rival, accounts, of, how, best, to, accommodate, the, mind, including, functionalism, anomalous, monism, and, identity, theory, scientific, materialism, is, often, synonymous, with, and, has, typically, been, described, as, a, reductive, materialism, in, the, early, 21st, century, paul, and, patricia, churchland, advocated, a, radically, contrasting, position, at, least, in, regard, to, certain, hypotheses, eliminative, materialism, eliminative, materialism, holds, that, some, mental, phenomena, simply, do, not, exist, at, all, and, that, talk, of, such, phenomena, reflects, a, spurious, folk, psychology, and, introspection, illusion, a, materialist, of, this, variety, might, believe, that, a, concept, like, belief, has, no, basis, in, fact, e, g, the, way, folk, science, speaks, of, demon, caused, illnesses, with, reductive, materialism, at, one, end, of, a, continuum, our, theories, will, reduce, to, facts, and, eliminative, materialism, at, the, other, certain, theories, will, need, to, be, eliminated, in, light, of, new, facts, revisionary, materialism, is, somewhere, in, the, middle, contemporary, continental, philosopher, gilles, deleuze, has, attempted, to, rework, and, strengthen, classical, materialist, ideas, contemporary, theorists, such, as, manuel, delanda, working, with, this, reinvigorated, materialism, have, come, to, be, classified, as, new, materialists, new, materialism, has, become, its, own, subfield, with, courses, on, it, at, major, universities, as, well, as, numerous, conferences, edited, collections, and, monographs, devoted, to, it, jane, bennett, s, 2010, book, vibrant, matter, has, been, particularly, instrumental, in, bringing, theories, of, monist, ontology, and, vitalism, back, into, a, critical, theoretical, fold, dominated, by, poststructuralist, theories, of, language, and, discourse, scholars, such, as, mel, y, chen, and, zakiyyah, iman, jackson, have, critiqued, this, body, of, new, materialist, literature, for, neglecting, to, consider, the, materiality, of, race, and, gender, in, particular, m, tis, scholar, zoe, todd, as, well, as, mohawk, bear, clan, six, nations, and, anishinaabe, scholar, vanessa, watts, query, the, colonial, orientation, of, the, race, for, a, new, materialism, watts, in, particular, describes, the, tendency, to, regard, matter, as, a, subject, of, feminist, or, philosophical, care, as, a, tendency, too, invested, in, the, reanimation, of, a, eurocentric, tradition, of, inquiry, at, the, expense, of, an, indigenous, ethic, of, responsibility, other, scholars, such, as, helene, vosters, echo, their, concerns, and, have, questioned, whether, there, is, anything, particularly, new, about, new, materialism, as, indigenous, and, other, animist, ontologies, have, attested, to, what, might, be, called, the, vibrancy, of, matter, for, centuries, others, such, as, thomas, nail, have, critiqued, vitalist, versions, of, new, materialism, for, depoliticizing, flat, ontology, and, being, ahistorical, quentin, meillassoux, proposed, speculative, materialism, a, post, kantian, return, to, david, hume, also, based, on, materialist, ideas, the, nature, and, definition, of, matter, like, other, key, concepts, in, science, and, philosophy, have, occasioned, much, debate, one, challenge, to, the, conventional, concept, of, matter, as, tangible, stuff, came, with, the, rise, of, field, physics, in, the, 19th, century, relativity, shows, that, matter, and, energy, including, the, spatially, distributed, energy, of, fields, are, interchangeable, this, enables, the, ontological, view, that, energy, is, prima, materia, and, matter, is, one, of, its, forms, in, contrast, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, uses, quantum, field, theory, to, describe, all, interactions, on, this, view, it, could, be, said, that, fields, are, prima, materia, and, the, energy, is, a, property, of, the, field, according, to, the, dominant, cosmological, model, the, lambda, cdm, model, less, than, 5, of, the, universe, s, energy, density, is, made, up, of, the, matter, the, standard, model, describes, and, most, of, the, universe, is, composed, of, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, with, little, agreement, among, scientists, about, what, these, are, made, of, with, the, advent, of, quantum, physics, some, scientists, believed, the, concept, of, matter, had, merely, changed, while, others, believed, the, conventional, position, could, no, longer, be, maintained, werner, heisenberg, said, the, ontology, of, materialism, rested, upon, the, illusion, that, the, kind, of, existence, the, direct, actuality, of, the, world, around, us, can, be, extrapolated, into, the, atomic, range, this, extrapolation, however, is, impossible, atoms, are, not, things, the, concept, of, matter, has, changed, in, response, to, new, scientific, discoveries, thus, materialism, has, no, definite, content, independent, of, the, particular, theory, of, matter, on, which, it, is, based, according, to, noam, chomsky, any, property, can, be, considered, material, if, one, defines, matter, such, that, it, has, that, property, the, philosophical, materialist, gustavo, bueno, uses, a, more, precise, term, than, matter, the, stroma, george, stack, distinguishes, between, materialism, and, physicalism, in, the, twentieth, century, physicalism, has, emerged, out, of, positivism, physicalism, restricts, meaningful, statements, to, physical, bodies, or, processes, that, are, verifiable, or, in, principle, verifiable, it, is, an, empirical, hypothesis, that, is, subject, to, revision, and, hence, lacks, the, dogmatic, stance, of, classical, materialism, herbert, feigl, defended, physicalism, in, the, united, states, and, consistently, held, that, mental, states, are, brain, states, and, that, mental, terms, have, the, same, referent, as, physical, terms, the, twentieth, century, has, witnessed, many, materialist, theories, of, the, mental, and, much, debate, surrounding, them, but, not, all, conceptions, of, physicalism, are, tied, to, verificationist, theories, of, meaning, or, direct, realist, accounts, of, perception, rather, physicalists, believe, that, no, element, of, reality, is, missing, from, the, mathematical, formalism, of, our, best, description, of, the, world, materialist, physicalists, also, believe, that, the, formalism, describes, fields, of, insentience, in, other, words, the, intrinsic, nature, of, the, physical, is, non, experiential, most, hindus, and, transcendentalists, regard, all, matter, as, an, illusion, or, maya, blinding, humans, from, the, truth, transcendental, experiences, like, the, perception, of, brahman, are, considered, to, destroy, the, illusion, rudolf, peierls, a, physicist, who, played, a, major, role, in, the, manhattan, project, rejected, materialism, the, premise, that, you, can, describe, in, terms, of, physics, the, whole, function, of, a, human, being, including, knowledge, and, consciousness, is, untenable, there, is, still, something, missing, erwin, schr, dinger, said, consciousness, cannot, be, accounted, for, in, physical, terms, for, consciousness, is, absolutely, fundamental, it, cannot, be, accounted, for, in, terms, of, anything, else, werner, heisenberg, wrote, the, ontology, of, materialism, rested, upon, the, illusion, that, the, kind, of, existence, the, direct, actuality, of, the, world, around, us, can, be, extrapolated, into, the, atomic, range, this, extrapolation, however, is, impossible, atoms, are, not, things, some, 20th, century, physicists, e, g, eugene, wigner, and, henry, stapp, and, some, modern, physicists, and, science, writers, e, g, stephen, barr, paul, davies, and, john, gribbin, have, argued, that, materialism, is, flawed, due, to, certain, recent, findings, in, physics, such, as, quantum, mechanics, and, chaos, theory, according, to, gribbin, and, davies, 1991, then, came, our, quantum, theory, which, totally, transformed, our, image, of, matter, the, old, assumption, that, the, microscopic, world, of, atoms, was, simply, a, scaled, down, version, of, the, everyday, world, had, to, be, abandoned, newton, s, deterministic, machine, was, replaced, by, a, shadowy, and, paradoxical, conjunction, of, waves, and, particles, governed, by, the, laws, of, chance, rather, than, the, rigid, rules, of, causality, an, extension, of, the, quantum, theory, goes, beyond, even, this, it, paints, a, picture, in, which, solid, matter, dissolves, away, to, be, replaced, by, weird, excitations, and, vibrations, of, invisible, field, energy, quantum, physics, undermines, materialism, because, it, reveals, that, matter, has, far, less, substance, than, we, might, believe, but, another, development, goes, even, further, by, demolishing, newton, s, image, of, matter, as, inert, lumps, this, development, is, the, theory, of, chaos, which, has, recently, gained, widespread, attention, the, objections, of, davies, and, gribbin, are, shared, by, proponents, of, digital, physics, who, view, information, rather, than, matter, as, fundamental, the, physicist, and, proponent, of, digital, physics, john, archibald, wheeler, wrote, all, matter, and, all, things, physical, are, information, theoretic, in, origin, and, this, is, a, participatory, universe, some, founders, of, quantum, theory, such, as, max, planck, shared, their, objections, he, wrote, as, a, man, who, has, devoted, his, whole, life, to, the, most, clear, headed, science, to, the, study, of, matter, i, can, tell, you, as, a, result, of, my, research, about, atoms, this, much, there, is, no, matter, as, such, all, matter, originates, and, exists, only, by, virtue, of, a, force, which, brings, the, particle, of, an, atom, to, vibration, and, holds, this, most, minute, solar, system, of, the, atom, together, we, must, assume, behind, this, force, the, existence, of, a, conscious, and, intelligent, mind, this, mind, is, the, matrix, of, all, matter, james, jeans, concurred, with, planck, saying, the, universe, begins, to, look, more, like, a, great, thought, than, like, a, great, machine, mind, no, longer, appears, to, be, an, accidental, intruder, into, the, realm, of, matter, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, immanuel, kant, argued, against, materialism, in, defending, his, transcendental, idealism, as, well, as, offering, arguments, against, subjective, idealism, and, mind, body, dualism, but, kant, argues, that, change, and, time, require, an, enduring, substrate, postmodern, poststructuralist, thinkers, also, express, skepticism, about, any, all, encompassing, metaphysical, scheme, philosopher, mary, midgley, argues, that, materialism, is, a, self, refuting, idea, at, least, in, its, eliminative, materialist, form, during, the, 20th, century, several, other, philosophers, also, offered, specific, criticisms, related, to, the, fundamental, concepts, underlying, scientific, materialism, among, them, was, the, australian, scholar, colin, murray, turbayne, who, in, his, the, myth, of, metaphor, analyzes, the, limitations, associated, with, several, metaphors, routinely, incorporated, as, literal, constructs, in, the, mechanistic, explanations, of, the, universe, first, outlined, by, isaac, newton, and, descartes, s, mind, body, dualism, such, as, substance, and, substratum, which, according, to, turbayne, have, little, if, any, meaning, he, further, argues, that, such, physicalist, theories, of, the, universe, generally, rely, upon, mechanistic, metaphors, drawn, through, the, use, of, deductive, logic, for, the, synthesis, of, their, respective, hypotheses, turbayne, observes, that, modern, man, has, become, victimized, by, the, metaphors, underlying, these, hypotheses, which, have, been, unintentionally, interpreted, as, examples, of, literal, truth, despite, their, limitations, arguments, for, idealism, such, as, those, of, hegel, and, berkeley, often, take, the, form, of, an, argument, against, materialism, indeed, berkeley, s, idealism, was, called, immaterialism, now, matter, can, be, argued, to, be, redundant, as, in, bundle, theory, and, mind, independent, properties, can, in, turn, be, reduced, to, subjective, percepts, berkeley, gives, an, example, of, the, latter, by, pointing, out, that, it, is, impossible, to, gather, direct, evidence, of, matter, as, there, is, no, direct, experience, of, matter, all, that, is, experienced, is, perception, whether, internal, or, external, as, such, matter, s, existence, can, only, be, inferred, from, the, apparent, perceived, stability, of, perceptions, it, finds, absolutely, no, evidence, in, direct, experience, if, matter, and, energy, are, seen, as, necessary, to, explain, the, physical, world, but, incapable, of, explaining, mind, dualism, results, emergence, holism, and, process, philosophy, seek, to, ameliorate, the, perceived, shortcomings, of, traditional, especially, mechanistic, materialism, without, abandoning, materialism, entirely, some, critics, object, to, materialism, as, part, of, an, overly, skeptical, narrow, or, reductivist, approach, to, theorizing, rather, than, to, the, ontological, claim, that, matter, is, the, only, substance, particle, physicist, and, anglican, theologian, john, polkinghorne, objects, to, what, he, calls, promissory, materialism, claims, that, materialistic, science, will, eventually, succeed, in, explaining, phenomena, it, has, not, so, far, been, able, to, explain, polkinghorne, prefers, dual, aspect, monism, to, materialism, some, scientific, materialists, have, been, criticized, for, failing, to, provide, clear, definitions, of, matter, leaving, the, term, materialism, without, any, definite, meaning, noam, chomsky, states, that, since, the, concept, of, matter, may, be, affected, by, new, scientific, discoveries, as, has, happened, in, the, past, scientific, materialists, are, being, dogmatic, in, assuming, the, opposite, a, indeed, it, has, been, noted, it, is, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, define, one, category, without, contrasting, it, with, the, other
