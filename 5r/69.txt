ontology, is, the, philosophical, study, of, being, as, one, of, the, most, fundamental, concepts, being, encompasses, all, of, reality, and, every, entity, within, it, to, articulate, the, basic, structure, of, being, ontology, examines, what, all, entities, have, in, common, and, how, they, are, divided, into, fundamental, classes, known, as, categories, an, influential, distinction, is, between, particular, and, universal, entities, particulars, are, unique, non, repeatable, entities, like, the, person, socrates, universals, are, general, repeatable, entities, like, the, color, green, another, contrast, is, between, concrete, objects, existing, in, space, and, time, like, a, tree, and, abstract, objects, existing, outside, space, and, time, like, the, number, 7, systems, of, categories, aim, to, provide, a, comprehensive, inventory, of, reality, employing, categories, such, as, substance, property, relation, state, of, affairs, and, event, ontologists, disagree, about, which, entities, exist, on, the, most, basic, level, platonic, realism, asserts, that, universals, have, objective, existence, conceptualism, says, that, universals, only, exist, in, the, mind, while, nominalism, denies, their, existence, there, are, similar, disputes, about, mathematical, objects, unobservable, objects, assumed, by, scientific, theories, and, moral, facts, materialism, says, that, fundamentally, there, is, only, matter, while, dualism, asserts, that, mind, and, matter, are, independent, principles, according, to, some, ontologists, there, are, no, objective, answers, to, ontological, questions, but, only, perspectives, shaped, by, different, linguistic, practices, ontology, uses, diverse, methods, of, inquiry, they, include, the, analysis, of, concepts, and, experience, the, use, of, intuitions, and, thought, experiments, and, the, integration, of, findings, from, natural, science, applied, ontology, employs, ontological, theories, and, principles, to, study, entities, belonging, to, a, specific, area, it, is, of, particular, relevance, to, information, and, computer, science, which, develop, conceptual, frameworks, of, limited, domains, these, frameworks, are, used, to, store, information, in, a, structured, way, such, as, a, college, database, tracking, academic, activities, ontology, is, closely, related, to, metaphysics, and, relevant, to, the, fields, of, logic, theology, and, anthropology, the, origins, of, ontology, lie, in, the, ancient, period, with, speculations, about, the, nature, of, being, and, the, source, of, the, universe, including, ancient, indian, chinese, and, greek, philosophy, in, the, modern, period, philosophers, conceived, ontology, as, a, distinct, academic, discipline, and, coined, its, name, ontology, is, the, study, of, being, it, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, that, investigates, the, nature, of, existence, the, features, all, entities, have, in, common, and, how, they, are, divided, into, basic, categories, of, being, it, aims, to, discover, the, foundational, building, blocks, of, the, world, and, characterize, reality, as, a, whole, in, its, most, general, aspects, in, this, regard, ontology, contrasts, with, individual, sciences, like, biology, and, astronomy, which, restrict, themselves, to, a, limited, domain, of, entities, such, as, living, entities, and, celestial, phenomena, in, some, contexts, the, term, ontology, refers, not, to, the, general, study, of, being, but, to, a, specific, ontological, theory, within, this, discipline, it, can, also, mean, a, conceptual, scheme, or, inventory, of, a, particular, domain, ontology, is, closely, related, to, metaphysics, but, the, exact, relation, of, these, two, disciplines, is, disputed, according, to, a, traditionally, influential, characterization, metaphysics, is, the, study, of, fundamental, reality, in, the, widest, sense, while, ontology, is, the, subdiscipline, of, metaphysics, that, restricts, itself, to, the, most, general, features, of, reality, this, view, sees, ontology, as, general, metaphysics, which, is, to, be, distinguished, from, special, metaphysics, focused, on, more, specific, subject, matters, like, god, mind, and, value, a, different, conception, understands, ontology, as, a, preliminary, discipline, that, provides, a, complete, inventory, of, reality, while, metaphysics, examines, the, features, and, structure, of, the, entities, in, this, inventory, another, conception, says, that, metaphysics, is, about, real, being, while, ontology, examines, possible, being, or, the, concept, of, being, it, is, not, universally, accepted, that, there, is, a, clear, boundary, between, metaphysics, and, ontology, some, philosophers, use, both, terms, as, synonyms, the, word, ontology, has, its, roots, in, the, ancient, greek, terms, ontos, meaning, being, and, logia, meaning, study, of, literally, the, study, of, being, the, ancient, greeks, did, not, use, the, term, ontology, which, was, coined, by, philosophers, in, the, 17th, century, being, or, existence, is, the, main, topic, of, ontology, it, is, one, of, the, most, general, and, fundamental, concepts, encompassing, the, whole, of, reality, and, every, entity, within, it, in, its, widest, sense, being, only, contrasts, with, non, being, or, nothingness, it, is, controversial, whether, a, more, substantial, analysis, of, the, concept, or, meaning, of, being, is, possible, one, proposal, understands, being, as, a, property, possessed, by, every, entity, critics, of, this, view, argue, that, an, entity, without, being, cannot, have, any, properties, meaning, that, being, cannot, be, a, property, since, properties, presuppose, being, a, different, suggestion, says, that, all, beings, share, a, set, of, essential, features, according, to, the, eleatic, principle, power, is, the, mark, of, being, meaning, that, only, entities, with, a, causal, influence, truly, exist, according, to, a, controversial, proposal, by, philosopher, george, berkeley, all, existence, is, mental, expressed, in, his, slogan, to, be, is, to, be, perceived, depending, on, the, context, the, term, being, is, sometimes, used, with, a, more, limited, meaning, to, refer, only, to, certain, aspects, of, reality, in, one, sense, being, is, unchanging, and, impermanent, and, is, distinguished, from, becoming, which, implies, change, another, contrast, is, between, being, as, what, truly, exists, and, phenomena, as, what, merely, appears, to, exist, in, some, contexts, being, expresses, the, fact, that, something, is, while, essence, expresses, its, qualities, or, what, it, is, like, ontologists, often, divide, being, into, fundamental, classes, or, highest, kinds, called, categories, of, being, proposed, categories, include, substance, property, relation, state, of, affairs, and, event, they, can, be, used, to, provide, systems, of, categories, which, offer, a, comprehensive, inventory, of, reality, in, which, every, entity, belongs, to, exactly, one, category, some, philosophers, like, aristotle, say, that, entities, belonging, to, different, categories, exist, in, distinct, ways, others, like, john, duns, scotus, insist, that, there, are, no, differences, in, the, mode, of, being, meaning, that, everything, exists, in, the, same, way, a, related, dispute, is, whether, some, entities, have, a, higher, degree, of, being, than, others, an, idea, already, found, in, plato, s, work, the, more, common, view, in, contemporary, philosophy, is, that, a, thing, either, exists, or, not, with, no, intermediary, states, or, degrees, the, relation, between, being, and, non, being, is, a, frequent, topic, in, ontology, influential, issues, include, the, status, of, nonexistent, objects, and, why, there, is, something, rather, than, nothing, a, central, distinction, in, ontology, is, between, particular, and, universal, entities, particulars, also, called, individuals, are, unique, non, repeatable, entities, like, socrates, the, taj, mahal, and, mars, universals, are, general, repeatable, entities, like, the, color, green, the, form, circularity, and, the, virtue, courage, universals, express, aspects, or, features, shared, by, particulars, for, example, mount, everest, and, mount, fuji, are, particulars, characterized, by, the, universal, mountain, universals, can, take, the, form, of, properties, or, relations, properties, express, what, entities, are, like, they, are, features, or, qualities, possessed, by, an, entity, properties, are, often, divided, into, essential, and, accidental, properties, a, property, is, essential, if, an, entity, must, have, it, it, is, accidental, if, the, entity, can, exist, without, it, for, instance, having, three, sides, is, an, essential, property, of, a, triangle, while, being, red, is, an, accidental, property, relations, are, ways, how, two, or, more, entities, stand, to, one, another, unlike, properties, they, apply, to, several, entities, and, characterize, them, as, a, group, for, example, being, a, city, is, a, property, while, being, east, of, is, a, relation, as, in, kathmandu, is, a, city, and, kathmandu, is, east, of, new, delhi, relations, are, often, divided, into, internal, and, external, relations, internal, relations, depend, only, on, the, properties, of, the, objects, they, connect, like, the, relation, of, resemblance, external, relations, express, characteristics, that, go, beyond, what, the, connected, objects, are, like, such, as, spatial, relations, substances, play, an, important, role, in, the, history, of, ontology, as, the, particular, entities, that, underlie, and, support, properties, and, relations, they, are, often, considered, the, fundamental, building, blocks, of, reality, that, can, exist, on, their, own, while, entities, like, properties, and, relations, cannot, exist, without, substances, substances, persist, through, changes, as, they, acquire, or, lose, properties, for, example, when, a, tomato, ripens, it, loses, the, property, green, and, acquires, the, property, red, states, of, affairs, are, complex, particular, entities, that, have, several, other, entities, as, their, components, the, state, of, affairs, socrates, is, wise, has, two, components, the, individual, socrates, and, the, property, wise, states, of, affairs, that, correspond, to, reality, are, called, facts, facts, are, truthmakers, of, statements, meaning, that, whether, a, statement, is, true, or, false, depends, on, the, underlying, facts, events, are, particular, entities, that, occur, in, time, like, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, and, the, first, moon, landing, they, usually, involve, some, kind, of, change, like, the, lawn, becoming, dry, in, some, cases, no, change, occurs, like, the, lawn, staying, wet, complex, events, also, called, processes, are, composed, of, a, sequence, of, events, concrete, objects, are, entities, that, exist, in, space, and, time, such, as, a, tree, a, car, and, a, planet, they, have, causal, powers, and, can, affect, each, other, like, when, a, car, hits, a, tree, and, both, are, deformed, in, the, process, abstract, objects, by, contrast, are, outside, space, and, time, such, as, the, number, 7, and, the, set, of, integers, they, lack, causal, powers, and, do, not, undergo, changes, it, is, controversial, whether, or, in, what, sense, abstract, objects, exist, and, how, people, can, know, about, them, concrete, objects, encountered, in, everyday, life, are, complex, entities, composed, of, various, parts, for, example, a, book, is, made, up, of, two, covers, and, pages, between, them, each, of, these, components, is, itself, constituted, of, smaller, parts, like, molecules, atoms, and, elementary, particles, mereology, studies, the, relation, between, parts, and, wholes, one, position, in, mereology, says, that, every, collection, of, entities, forms, a, whole, according, to, a, different, view, this, is, only, the, case, for, collections, that, fulfill, certain, requirements, for, instance, that, the, entities, in, the, collection, touch, one, another, the, problem, of, material, constitution, asks, whether, or, in, what, sense, a, whole, should, be, considered, a, new, object, in, addition, to, the, collection, of, parts, composing, it, abstract, objects, are, closely, related, to, fictional, and, intentional, objects, fictional, objects, are, entities, invented, in, works, of, fiction, they, can, be, things, like, the, one, ring, in, j, r, r, tolkien, s, book, series, the, lord, of, the, rings, and, people, like, the, monkey, king, in, the, novel, journey, to, the, west, some, philosophers, say, that, fictional, objects, are, one, type, of, abstract, object, existing, outside, space, and, time, others, understand, them, as, artifacts, that, are, created, as, the, works, of, fiction, are, written, intentional, objects, are, entities, that, exist, within, mental, states, like, perceptions, beliefs, and, desires, for, example, if, a, person, thinks, about, the, loch, ness, monster, then, the, loch, ness, monster, is, the, intentional, object, of, this, thought, people, can, think, about, existing, and, non, existing, objects, making, it, difficult, to, assess, the, ontological, status, of, intentional, objects, ontological, dependence, is, a, relation, between, entities, an, entity, depends, ontologically, on, another, entity, if, the, first, entity, cannot, exist, without, the, second, entity, for, instance, the, surface, of, an, apple, cannot, exist, without, the, apple, an, entity, is, ontologically, independent, if, it, does, not, depend, on, anything, else, meaning, that, it, is, fundamental, and, can, exist, on, its, own, ontological, dependence, plays, a, central, role, in, ontology, and, its, attempt, to, describe, reality, on, its, most, fundamental, level, it, is, closely, related, to, metaphysical, grounding, which, is, the, relation, between, a, ground, and, facts, it, explains, an, ontological, commitment, of, a, person, or, a, theory, is, an, entity, that, exists, according, to, them, for, instance, a, person, who, believes, in, god, has, an, ontological, commitment, to, god, ontological, commitments, can, be, used, to, analyze, which, ontologies, people, explicitly, defend, or, implicitly, assume, they, play, a, central, role, in, contemporary, metaphysics, when, trying, to, decide, between, competing, theories, for, example, the, quine, putnam, indispensability, argument, defends, mathematical, platonism, asserting, that, numbers, exist, because, the, best, scientific, theories, are, ontologically, committed, to, numbers, possibility, and, necessity, are, further, topics, in, ontology, possibility, describes, what, can, be, the, case, as, in, it, is, possible, that, extraterrestrial, life, exists, necessity, describes, what, must, be, the, case, as, in, it, is, necessary, that, three, plus, two, equals, five, possibility, and, necessity, contrast, with, actuality, which, describes, what, is, the, case, as, in, doha, is, the, capital, of, qatar, ontologists, often, use, the, concept, of, possible, worlds, to, analyze, possibility, and, necessity, a, possible, world, is, a, complete, and, consistent, way, how, things, could, have, been, for, example, haruki, murakami, was, born, in, 1949, in, the, actual, world, but, there, are, possible, worlds, in, which, he, was, born, at, a, different, date, using, this, idea, possible, world, semantics, says, that, a, sentence, is, possibly, true, if, it, is, true, in, at, least, one, possible, world, a, sentence, is, necessarily, true, if, it, is, true, in, all, possible, worlds, in, ontology, identity, means, that, two, things, are, the, same, philosophers, distinguish, between, qualitative, and, numerical, identity, two, entities, are, qualitatively, identical, if, they, have, exactly, the, same, features, such, as, perfect, identical, twins, this, is, also, called, exact, similarity, and, indiscernibility, numerical, identity, by, contrast, means, that, there, is, only, a, single, entity, for, example, if, fatima, is, the, mother, of, leila, and, hugo, then, leila, s, mother, is, numerically, identical, to, hugo, s, mother, another, distinction, is, between, synchronic, and, diachronic, identity, synchronic, identity, relates, an, entity, to, itself, at, the, same, time, diachronic, identity, relates, an, entity, to, itself, at, different, times, as, in, the, woman, who, bore, leila, three, years, ago, is, the, same, woman, who, bore, hugo, this, year, there, are, different, and, sometimes, overlapping, ways, to, divide, ontology, into, branches, pure, ontology, focuses, on, the, most, abstract, topics, associated, with, the, concept, and, nature, of, being, it, is, not, restricted, to, a, specific, domain, of, entities, and, studies, existence, and, the, structure, of, reality, as, a, whole, pure, ontology, contrasts, with, applied, ontology, also, called, domain, ontology, applied, ontology, examines, the, application, of, ontological, theories, and, principles, to, specific, disciplines, and, domains, often, in, the, field, of, science, it, considers, ontological, problems, in, regard, to, specific, entities, such, as, matter, mind, numbers, god, and, cultural, artifacts, social, ontology, a, major, subfield, of, applied, ontology, studies, social, kinds, like, money, gender, society, and, language, it, aims, to, determine, the, nature, and, essential, features, of, these, concepts, while, also, examining, their, mode, of, existence, according, to, a, common, view, social, kinds, are, useful, constructions, to, describe, the, complexities, of, social, life, this, means, that, they, are, not, pure, fictions, but, at, the, same, time, lack, the, objective, or, mind, independent, reality, of, natural, phenomena, like, elementary, particles, lions, and, stars, in, the, fields, of, computer, science, information, science, and, knowledge, representation, applied, ontology, is, interested, in, the, development, of, formal, frameworks, to, encode, and, store, information, about, a, limited, domain, of, entities, in, a, structured, way, a, related, application, in, genetics, is, gene, ontology, which, is, a, comprehensive, framework, for, the, standardized, representation, of, gene, related, information, across, species, and, databases, formal, ontology, is, the, study, of, objects, in, general, while, focusing, on, their, abstract, structures, and, features, it, divides, objects, into, different, categories, based, on, the, forms, they, exemplify, formal, ontologists, often, rely, on, the, tools, of, formal, logic, to, express, their, findings, in, an, abstract, and, general, manner, formal, ontology, contrasts, with, material, ontology, which, distinguishes, between, different, areas, of, objects, and, examines, the, features, characteristic, of, a, specific, area, examples, are, ideal, spatial, beings, in, the, area, of, geometry, and, living, beings, in, the, area, of, biology, descriptive, ontology, aims, to, articulate, the, conceptual, scheme, underlying, how, people, ordinarily, think, about, the, world, prescriptive, ontology, departs, from, common, conceptions, of, the, structure, of, reality, and, seeks, to, formulate, a, new, and, better, conceptualization, another, contrast, is, between, analytic, and, speculative, ontology, analytic, ontology, examines, the, types, and, categories, of, being, to, determine, what, kinds, of, things, could, exist, and, what, features, they, would, have, speculative, ontology, aims, to, determine, which, entities, actually, exist, for, example, whether, there, are, numbers, or, whether, time, is, an, illusion, metaontology, studies, the, underlying, concepts, assumptions, and, methods, of, ontology, unlike, other, forms, of, ontology, it, does, not, ask, what, exists, but, what, does, it, mean, for, something, to, exist, and, how, can, people, determine, what, exists, it, is, closely, related, to, fundamental, ontology, an, approach, developed, by, philosopher, martin, heidegger, that, seeks, to, uncover, the, meaning, of, being, the, term, realism, is, used, for, various, theories, that, affirm, that, some, kind, of, phenomenon, is, real, or, has, mind, independent, existence, ontological, realism, is, the, view, that, there, are, objective, facts, about, what, exists, and, what, the, nature, and, categories, of, being, are, ontological, realists, do, not, make, claims, about, what, those, facts, are, for, example, whether, elementary, particles, exist, they, merely, state, that, there, are, mind, independent, facts, that, determine, which, ontological, theories, are, true, this, idea, is, denied, by, ontological, anti, realists, also, called, ontological, deflationists, who, say, that, there, are, no, substantive, facts, one, way, or, the, other, according, to, philosopher, rudolf, carnap, for, example, ontological, statements, are, relative, to, language, and, depend, on, the, ontological, framework, of, the, speaker, this, means, that, there, are, no, framework, independent, ontological, facts, since, different, frameworks, provide, different, views, while, there, is, no, objectively, right, or, wrong, framework, in, a, more, narrow, sense, realism, refers, to, the, existence, of, certain, types, of, entities, realists, about, universals, say, that, universals, have, mind, independent, existence, according, to, platonic, realists, universals, exist, not, only, independent, of, the, mind, but, also, independent, of, particular, objects, that, exemplify, them, this, means, that, the, universal, red, could, exist, by, itself, even, if, there, were, no, red, objects, in, the, world, aristotelian, realism, also, called, moderate, realism, rejects, this, idea, and, says, that, universals, only, exist, as, long, as, there, are, objects, that, exemplify, them, conceptualism, by, contrast, is, a, form, of, anti, realism, stating, that, universals, only, exist, in, the, mind, as, concepts, that, people, use, to, understand, and, categorize, the, world, nominalists, defend, a, strong, form, of, anti, realism, by, saying, that, universals, have, no, existence, this, means, that, the, world, is, entirely, composed, of, particular, objects, mathematical, realism, a, closely, related, view, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, says, that, mathematical, facts, exist, independently, of, human, language, thought, and, practices, and, are, discovered, rather, than, invented, according, to, mathematical, platonism, this, is, the, case, because, of, the, existence, of, mathematical, objects, like, numbers, and, sets, mathematical, platonists, say, that, mathematical, objects, are, as, real, as, physical, objects, like, atoms, and, stars, even, though, they, are, not, accessible, to, empirical, observation, influential, forms, of, mathematical, anti, realism, include, conventionalism, which, says, that, mathematical, theories, are, trivially, true, simply, by, how, mathematical, terms, are, defined, and, game, formalism, which, understands, mathematics, not, as, a, theory, of, reality, but, as, a, game, governed, by, rules, of, string, manipulation, modal, realism, is, the, theory, that, in, addition, to, the, actual, world, there, are, countless, possible, worlds, as, real, and, concrete, as, the, actual, world, the, primary, difference, is, that, the, actual, world, is, inhabited, by, us, while, other, possible, worlds, are, inhabited, by, our, counterparts, modal, anti, realists, reject, this, view, and, argue, that, possible, worlds, do, not, have, concrete, reality, but, exist, in, a, different, sense, for, example, as, abstract, or, fictional, objects, scientific, realists, say, that, the, scientific, description, of, the, world, is, an, accurate, representation, of, reality, it, is, of, particular, relevance, in, regard, to, things, that, cannot, be, directly, observed, by, humans, but, are, assumed, to, exist, by, scientific, theories, like, electrons, forces, and, laws, of, nature, scientific, anti, realism, says, that, scientific, theories, are, not, descriptions, of, reality, but, instruments, to, predict, observations, and, the, outcomes, of, experiments, moral, realists, claim, that, there, exist, mind, independent, moral, facts, according, to, them, there, are, objective, principles, that, determine, which, behavior, is, morally, right, moral, anti, realists, either, claim, that, moral, principles, are, subjective, and, differ, between, persons, and, cultures, a, position, known, as, moral, relativism, or, outright, deny, the, existence, of, moral, facts, a, view, referred, to, as, moral, nihilism, monocategorical, theories, say, that, there, is, only, one, fundamental, category, meaning, that, every, single, entity, belongs, to, the, same, universal, class, for, example, some, forms, of, nominalism, state, that, only, concrete, particulars, exist, while, some, forms, of, bundle, theory, state, that, only, properties, exist, polycategorical, theories, by, contrast, hold, that, there, is, more, than, one, basic, category, meaning, that, entities, are, divided, into, two, or, more, fundamental, classes, they, take, the, form, of, systems, of, categories, which, list, the, highest, genera, of, being, to, provide, a, comprehensive, inventory, of, everything, the, closely, related, discussion, between, monism, and, dualism, is, about, the, most, fundamental, types, that, make, up, reality, according, to, monism, there, is, only, one, kind, of, thing, or, substance, on, the, most, basic, level, materialism, is, an, influential, monist, view, it, says, that, everything, is, material, this, means, that, mental, phenomena, such, as, beliefs, emotions, and, consciousness, either, do, not, exist, or, exist, as, aspects, of, matter, like, brain, states, idealists, take, the, converse, perspective, arguing, that, everything, is, mental, they, may, understand, physical, phenomena, like, rocks, trees, and, planets, as, ideas, or, perceptions, of, conscious, minds, neutral, monism, occupies, a, middle, ground, by, saying, that, both, mind, and, matter, are, derivative, phenomena, dualists, state, that, mind, and, matter, exist, as, independent, principles, either, as, distinct, substances, or, different, types, of, properties, in, a, slightly, different, sense, monism, contrasts, with, pluralism, as, a, view, not, about, the, number, of, basic, types, but, the, number, of, entities, in, this, sense, monism, is, the, controversial, position, that, only, a, single, all, encompassing, entity, exists, in, all, of, reality, pluralism, is, more, commonly, accepted, and, says, that, several, distinct, entities, exist, the, historically, influential, substance, attribute, ontology, is, a, polycategorical, theory, it, says, that, reality, is, at, its, most, fundamental, level, made, up, of, unanalyzable, substances, that, are, characterized, by, universals, such, as, the, properties, an, individual, substance, has, or, relations, that, exist, between, substances, the, closely, related, to, substratum, theory, says, that, each, concrete, object, is, made, up, of, properties, and, a, substratum, the, difference, is, that, the, substratum, is, not, characterized, by, properties, it, is, a, featureless, or, bare, particular, that, merely, supports, the, properties, various, alternative, ontological, theories, have, been, proposed, that, deny, the, role, of, substances, as, the, foundational, building, blocks, of, reality, stuff, ontologies, say, that, the, world, is, not, populated, by, distinct, entities, but, by, continuous, stuff, that, fills, space, this, stuff, may, take, various, forms, and, is, often, conceived, as, infinitely, divisible, according, to, process, ontology, processes, or, events, are, the, fundamental, entities, this, view, usually, emphasizes, that, nothing, in, reality, is, static, meaning, that, being, is, dynamic, and, characterized, by, constant, change, bundle, theories, state, that, there, are, no, regular, objects, but, only, bundles, of, co, present, properties, for, example, a, lemon, may, be, understood, as, a, bundle, that, includes, the, properties, yellow, sour, and, round, according, to, traditional, bundle, theory, the, bundled, properties, are, universals, meaning, that, the, same, property, may, belong, to, several, different, bundles, according, to, trope, bundle, theory, properties, are, particular, entities, that, belong, to, a, single, bundle, some, ontologies, focus, not, on, distinct, objects, but, on, interrelatedness, according, to, relationalism, all, of, reality, is, relational, at, its, most, fundamental, level, ontic, structural, realism, agrees, with, this, basic, idea, and, focuses, on, how, these, relations, form, complex, structures, some, structural, realists, state, that, there, is, nothing, but, relations, meaning, that, individual, objects, do, not, exist, others, say, that, individual, objects, exist, but, depend, on, the, structures, in, which, they, participate, fact, ontologies, present, a, different, approach, by, focusing, on, how, entities, belonging, to, different, categories, come, together, to, constitute, the, world, facts, also, known, as, states, of, affairs, are, complex, entities, for, example, the, fact, that, the, earth, is, a, planet, consists, of, the, particular, object, the, earth, and, the, property, being, a, planet, fact, ontologies, state, that, facts, are, the, fundamental, constituents, of, reality, meaning, that, objects, properties, and, relations, cannot, exist, on, their, own, and, only, form, part, of, reality, to, the, extent, that, they, participate, in, facts, in, the, history, of, philosophy, various, ontological, theories, based, on, several, fundamental, categories, have, been, proposed, one, of, the, first, theories, of, categories, was, suggested, by, aristotle, whose, system, includes, ten, categories, substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, date, posture, state, action, and, passion, an, early, influential, system, of, categories, in, indian, philosophy, first, proposed, in, the, vaisheshika, school, distinguishes, between, six, categories, substance, quality, motion, universal, individuator, and, inherence, immanuel, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, includes, a, system, of, twelve, categories, which, kant, saw, as, pure, concepts, of, understanding, they, are, subdivided, into, four, classes, quantity, quality, relation, and, modality, in, more, recent, philosophy, theories, of, categories, were, developed, by, c, s, peirce, edmund, husserl, samuel, alexander, roderick, chisholm, and, e, j, lowe, the, dispute, between, constituent, and, relational, ontologies, concerns, the, internal, structure, of, concrete, particular, objects, constituent, ontologies, say, that, objects, have, an, internal, structure, with, properties, as, their, component, parts, bundle, theories, are, an, example, of, this, position, they, state, that, objects, are, bundles, of, properties, this, view, is, rejected, by, relational, ontologies, which, say, that, objects, have, no, internal, structure, meaning, that, properties, do, not, inhere, in, them, but, are, externally, related, to, them, according, to, one, analogy, objects, are, like, pin, cushions, and, properties, are, pins, that, can, be, stuck, to, objects, and, removed, again, without, becoming, a, real, part, of, objects, relational, ontologies, are, common, in, certain, forms, of, nominalism, that, reject, the, existence, of, universal, properties, hierarchical, ontologies, state, that, the, world, is, organized, into, levels, entities, on, all, levels, are, real, but, low, level, entities, are, more, fundamental, than, high, level, entities, this, means, that, they, can, exist, without, high, level, entities, while, high, level, entities, cannot, exist, without, low, level, entities, one, hierarchical, ontology, says, that, elementary, particles, are, more, fundamental, than, the, macroscopic, objects, they, compose, like, chairs, and, tables, other, hierarchical, theories, assert, that, substances, are, more, fundamental, than, their, properties, and, that, nature, is, more, fundamental, than, culture, flat, ontologies, by, contrast, deny, that, any, entity, has, a, privileged, status, meaning, that, all, entities, exist, on, the, same, level, for, them, the, main, question, is, only, whether, something, exists, rather, than, identifying, the, level, at, which, it, exists, the, ontological, theories, of, endurantism, and, perdurantism, aim, to, explain, how, material, objects, persist, through, time, endurantism, is, the, view, that, material, objects, are, three, dimensional, entities, that, travel, through, time, while, being, fully, present, in, each, moment, they, remain, the, same, even, when, they, gain, or, lose, properties, as, they, change, perdurantism, is, the, view, that, material, objects, are, four, dimensional, entities, that, extend, not, just, through, space, but, also, through, time, this, means, that, they, are, composed, of, temporal, parts, and, at, any, moment, only, one, part, of, them, is, present, but, not, the, others, according, to, perdurantists, change, means, that, an, earlier, part, exhibits, different, qualities, than, a, later, part, when, a, tree, loses, its, leaves, for, instance, there, is, an, earlier, temporal, part, with, leaves, and, a, later, temporal, part, without, leaves, differential, ontology, is, a, poststructuralist, approach, interested, in, the, relation, between, the, concepts, of, identity, and, difference, it, says, that, traditional, ontology, sees, identity, as, the, more, basic, term, by, first, characterizing, things, in, terms, of, their, essential, features, and, then, elaborating, differences, based, on, this, conception, differential, ontologists, by, contrast, privilege, difference, and, say, that, the, identity, of, a, thing, is, a, secondary, determination, that, depends, on, how, this, thing, differs, from, other, things, object, oriented, ontology, belongs, to, the, school, of, speculative, realism, and, examines, the, nature, and, role, of, objects, it, sees, objects, as, the, fundamental, building, blocks, of, reality, as, a, flat, ontology, it, denies, that, some, entities, have, a, more, fundamental, form, of, existence, than, others, it, uses, this, idea, to, argue, that, objects, exist, independently, of, human, thought, and, perception, methods, of, ontology, are, ways, of, conducting, ontological, inquiry, and, deciding, between, competing, theories, there, is, no, single, standard, method, the, diverse, approaches, are, studied, by, metaontology, conceptual, analysis, is, a, method, to, understand, ontological, concepts, and, clarify, their, meaning, it, proceeds, by, analyzing, their, component, parts, and, the, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, under, which, a, concept, applies, to, an, entity, this, information, can, help, ontologists, decide, whether, a, certain, type, of, entity, such, as, numbers, exists, eidetic, variation, is, a, related, method, in, phenomenological, ontology, that, aims, to, identify, the, essential, features, of, different, types, of, objects, phenomenologists, start, by, imagining, an, example, of, the, investigated, type, they, proceed, by, varying, the, imagined, features, to, determine, which, ones, cannot, be, changed, meaning, they, are, essential, the, transcendental, method, begins, with, a, simple, observation, that, a, certain, entity, exists, in, the, following, step, it, studies, the, ontological, repercussions, of, this, observation, by, examining, how, it, is, possible, or, which, conditions, are, required, for, this, entity, to, exist, another, approach, is, based, on, intuitions, in, the, form, of, non, inferential, impressions, about, the, correctness, of, general, principles, these, principles, can, be, used, as, the, foundation, on, which, an, ontological, system, is, built, and, expanded, using, deductive, reasoning, a, further, intuition, based, method, relies, on, thought, experiments, to, evoke, new, intuitions, this, happens, by, imagining, a, situation, relevant, to, an, ontological, issue, and, then, employing, counterfactual, thinking, to, assess, the, consequences, of, this, situation, for, example, some, ontologists, examine, the, relation, between, mind, and, matter, by, imagining, creatures, identical, to, humans, but, without, consciousness, naturalistic, methods, rely, on, the, insights, of, the, natural, sciences, to, determine, what, exists, according, to, an, influential, approach, by, willard, van, orman, quine, ontology, can, be, conducted, by, analyzing, the, ontological, commitments, of, scientific, theories, this, method, is, based, on, the, idea, that, scientific, theories, provide, the, most, reliable, description, of, reality, and, that, their, power, can, be, harnessed, by, investigating, the, ontological, assumptions, underlying, them, principles, of, theory, choice, offer, guidelines, for, assessing, the, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, ontological, theories, rather, than, guiding, their, construction, the, principle, of, ockham, s, razor, says, that, simple, theories, are, preferable, a, theory, can, be, simple, in, different, respects, for, example, by, using, very, few, basic, types, or, by, describing, the, world, with, a, small, number, of, fundamental, entities, ontologists, are, also, interested, in, the, explanatory, power, of, theories, and, give, preference, to, theories, that, can, explain, many, observations, a, further, factor, is, how, close, a, theory, is, to, common, sense, some, ontologists, use, this, principle, as, an, argument, against, theories, that, are, very, different, from, how, ordinary, people, think, about, the, issue, in, applied, ontology, ontological, engineering, is, the, process, of, creating, and, refining, conceptual, models, of, specific, domains, developing, a, new, ontology, from, scratch, involves, various, preparatory, steps, such, as, delineating, the, scope, of, the, domain, one, intends, to, model, and, specifying, the, purpose, and, use, cases, of, the, ontology, once, the, foundational, concepts, within, the, area, have, been, identified, ontology, engineers, proceed, by, defining, them, and, characterizing, the, relations, between, them, this, is, usually, done, in, a, formal, language, to, ensure, precision, and, in, some, cases, automatic, computability, in, the, following, review, phase, the, validity, of, the, ontology, is, assessed, using, test, data, various, more, specific, instructions, for, how, to, carry, out, the, different, steps, have, been, suggested, they, include, the, cyc, method, gr, ninger, and, fox, s, methodology, and, methontology, in, some, cases, it, is, feasible, to, adapt, a, pre, existing, ontology, to, fit, a, specific, domain, and, purpose, rather, than, creating, a, new, one, from, scratch, ontology, overlaps, with, many, disciplines, including, logic, the, study, of, correct, reasoning, ontologists, often, employ, logical, systems, to, express, their, insights, specifically, in, the, field, of, formal, ontology, of, particular, interest, to, them, is, the, existential, quantifier, displaystyle, exists, which, is, used, to, express, what, exists, in, first, order, logic, for, example, the, formula, x, dog, x, displaystyle, exists, x, text, dog, x, states, that, dogs, exist, some, philosophers, study, ontology, by, examining, the, structure, of, thought, and, language, saying, that, they, reflect, the, structure, of, being, doubts, about, the, accuracy, of, natural, language, have, led, some, ontologists, to, seek, a, new, formal, language, termed, ontologese, for, a, better, representation, of, the, fundamental, structure, of, reality, ontologies, are, often, used, in, information, science, to, provide, a, conceptual, scheme, or, inventory, of, a, specific, domain, making, it, possible, to, classify, objects, and, formally, represent, information, about, them, this, is, of, specific, interest, to, computer, science, which, builds, databases, to, store, this, information, and, defines, computational, processes, to, automatically, transform, and, use, it, for, instance, to, encode, and, store, information, about, academic, activities, a, college, database, may, use, an, ontology, with, categories, such, as, person, teacher, student, and, exam, in, some, cases, it, is, necessary, to, exchange, information, belonging, to, different, domains, or, to, integrate, databases, using, distinct, ontologies, this, can, be, achieved, with, the, help, of, upper, ontologies, which, are, not, limited, to, one, specific, domain, they, use, general, categories, that, apply, to, most, or, all, domains, like, suggested, upper, merged, ontology, and, basic, formal, ontology, similar, applications, of, ontology, are, found, in, various, fields, seeking, to, manage, extensive, information, within, a, structured, framework, protein, ontology, is, a, formal, framework, for, the, standardized, representation, of, protein, related, entities, and, their, relationships, gene, ontology, and, sequence, ontology, serve, a, similar, purpose, in, the, field, of, genetics, environment, ontology, is, a, knowledge, representation, focused, on, ecosystems, and, environmental, processes, friend, of, a, friend, provides, a, conceptual, framework, to, represent, relations, between, people, and, their, interests, and, activities, the, topic, of, ontology, has, received, increased, attention, in, anthropology, since, the, 1990s, sometimes, termed, the, ontological, turn, this, type, of, inquiry, is, focused, on, how, people, from, different, cultures, experience, and, understand, the, nature, of, being, specific, interest, has, been, given, to, the, ontological, outlook, of, indigenous, people, and, how, it, differs, from, a, western, perspective, as, an, example, of, this, contrast, it, has, been, argued, that, various, indigenous, communities, ascribe, intentionality, to, non, human, entities, like, plants, forests, or, rivers, this, outlook, is, known, as, animism, and, is, also, found, in, native, american, ontologies, which, emphasize, the, interconnectedness, of, all, living, entities, and, the, importance, of, balance, and, harmony, with, nature, ontology, is, closely, related, to, theology, and, its, interest, in, the, existence, of, god, as, an, ultimate, entity, the, ontological, argument, first, proposed, by, anselm, of, canterbury, attempts, to, prove, the, existence, of, the, divine, it, defines, god, as, the, greatest, conceivable, being, from, this, definition, it, concludes, that, god, must, exist, since, god, would, not, be, the, greatest, conceivable, being, if, god, lacked, existence, another, overlap, in, the, two, disciplines, is, found, in, ontological, theories, that, use, god, or, an, ultimate, being, as, the, foundational, principle, of, reality, heidegger, criticized, this, approach, terming, it, ontotheology, the, roots, of, ontology, in, ancient, philosophy, are, speculations, about, the, nature, of, being, and, the, source, of, the, universe, discussions, of, the, essence, of, reality, are, found, in, the, upanishads, ancient, indian, scriptures, dating, from, as, early, as, 700, bce, they, say, that, the, universe, has, a, divine, foundation, and, discuss, in, what, sense, ultimate, reality, is, one, or, many, samkhya, the, first, orthodox, school, of, indian, philosophy, formulated, an, atheist, dualist, ontology, based, on, the, upanishads, identifying, pure, consciousness, and, matter, as, its, two, foundational, principles, the, later, vaisheshika, school, proposed, a, comprehensive, system, of, categories, in, ancient, china, laozi, s, 6th, century, bce, taoism, examines, the, underlying, order, of, the, universe, known, as, tao, and, how, this, order, is, shaped, by, the, interaction, of, two, basic, forces, yin, and, yang, the, philosophical, movement, of, xuanxue, emerged, in, the, 3rd, century, ce, and, explored, the, relation, between, being, and, non, being, starting, in, the, 6th, century, bce, presocratic, philosophers, in, ancient, greece, aimed, to, provide, rational, explanations, of, the, universe, they, suggested, that, a, first, principle, such, as, water, or, fire, is, the, primal, source, of, all, things, parmenides, c, 515, 450, bce, is, sometimes, considered, the, founder, of, ontology, because, of, his, explicit, discussion, of, the, concepts, of, being, and, non, being, inspired, by, presocratic, philosophy, plato, 427, 347, bce, developed, his, theory, of, forms, it, distinguishes, between, unchangeable, perfect, forms, and, matter, which, has, a, lower, degree, of, existence, and, imitates, the, forms, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, suggested, an, elaborate, system, of, categories, that, introduced, the, concept, of, substance, as, the, primary, kind, of, being, the, school, of, neoplatonism, arose, in, the, 3rd, century, ce, and, proposed, an, ineffable, source, of, everything, called, the, one, which, is, more, basic, than, being, itself, the, problem, of, universals, was, an, influential, topic, in, medieval, ontology, boethius, 477, 524, ce, suggested, that, universals, can, exist, not, only, in, matter, but, also, in, the, mind, this, view, inspired, peter, abelard, 1079, 1142, ce, who, proposed, that, universals, exist, only, in, the, mind, thomas, aquinas, 1224, 1274, ce, developed, and, refined, fundamental, ontological, distinctions, such, as, the, contrast, between, existence, and, essence, between, substance, and, accidents, and, between, matter, and, form, he, also, discussed, the, transcendentals, which, are, the, most, general, properties, or, modes, of, being, john, duns, scotus, 1266, 1308, argued, that, all, entities, including, god, exist, in, the, same, way, and, that, each, entity, has, a, unique, essence, called, haecceity, william, of, ockham, c, 1287, 1347, ce, proposed, that, one, can, decide, between, competing, ontological, theories, by, assessing, which, one, uses, the, smallest, number, of, elements, a, principle, known, as, ockham, s, razor, in, arabic, persian, philosophy, avicenna, 980, 1037, ce, combined, ontology, with, theology, he, identified, god, as, a, necessary, being, that, is, the, source, of, everything, else, which, only, has, contingent, existence, in, 8th, century, indian, philosophy, the, school, of, advaita, vedanta, emerged, it, says, that, only, a, single, all, encompassing, entity, exists, stating, that, the, impression, of, a, plurality, of, distinct, entities, is, an, illusion, starting, in, the, 13th, century, ce, the, navya, ny, ya, school, built, on, vaisheshika, ontology, with, a, particular, focus, on, the, problem, of, non, existence, and, negation, 9th, century, china, saw, the, emergence, of, neo, confucianism, which, developed, the, idea, that, a, rational, principle, known, as, li, is, the, ground, of, being, and, order, of, the, cosmos, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, formulated, a, dualist, ontology, at, the, beginning, of, the, modern, period, it, distinguishes, between, mind, and, matter, as, distinct, substances, that, causally, interact, rejecting, descartes, s, dualism, baruch, spinoza, 1632, 1677, proposed, a, monist, ontology, according, to, which, there, is, only, a, single, entity, that, is, identical, to, god, and, nature, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, 1646, 1716, by, contrast, said, that, the, universe, is, made, up, of, many, simple, substances, which, are, synchronized, but, do, not, interact, with, one, another, john, locke, 1632, 1704, proposed, his, substratum, theory, which, says, that, each, object, has, a, featureless, substratum, that, supports, the, object, s, properties, christian, wolff, 1679, 1754, was, influential, in, establishing, ontology, as, a, distinct, discipline, delimiting, its, scope, from, other, forms, of, metaphysical, inquiry, george, berkeley, 1685, 1753, developed, an, idealist, ontology, according, to, which, material, objects, are, ideas, perceived, by, minds, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, rejected, the, idea, that, humans, can, have, direct, knowledge, of, independently, existing, things, and, their, nature, limiting, knowledge, to, the, field, of, appearances, for, kant, ontology, does, not, study, external, things, but, provides, a, system, of, pure, concepts, of, understanding, influenced, by, kant, s, philosophy, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, linked, ontology, and, logic, he, said, that, being, and, thought, are, identical, and, examined, their, foundational, structures, arthur, schopenhauer, 1788, 1860, rejected, hegel, s, philosophy, and, proposed, that, the, world, is, an, expression, of, a, blind, and, irrational, will, francis, herbert, bradley, 1846, 1924, saw, absolute, spirit, as, the, ultimate, and, all, encompassing, reality, while, denying, that, there, are, any, external, relations, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, developed, phenomenology, and, employed, its, method, the, description, of, experience, to, address, ontological, problems, this, idea, inspired, his, student, martin, heidegger, 1889, 1976, to, clarify, the, meaning, of, being, by, exploring, the, mode, of, human, existence, jean, paul, sartre, responded, to, heidegger, s, philosophy, by, examining, the, relation, between, being, and, nothingness, from, the, perspective, of, human, existence, freedom, and, consciousness, based, on, the, phenomenological, method, nicolai, hartmann, 1882, 1950, developed, a, complex, hierarchical, ontology, that, divides, reality, into, four, levels, inanimate, biological, psychological, and, spiritual, alexius, meinong, 1853, 1920, articulated, a, controversial, ontological, theory, that, includes, nonexistent, objects, as, part, of, being, arguing, against, this, theory, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, formulated, a, fact, ontology, known, as, logical, atomism, this, idea, was, further, refined, by, the, early, ludwig, wittgenstein, 1889, 1951, and, inspired, d, m, armstrong, s, 1926, 2014, ontology, alfred, north, whitehead, 1861, 1947, by, contrast, developed, a, process, ontology, rudolf, carnap, 1891, 1970, questioned, the, objectivity, of, ontological, theories, by, claiming, that, what, exists, depends, on, one, s, linguistic, framework, he, had, a, strong, influence, on, willard, van, orman, quine, 1908, 2000, who, analyzed, the, ontological, commitments, of, scientific, theories, to, solve, ontological, problems, quine, s, student, david, lewis, 1941, 2001, formulated, the, position, of, modal, realism, which, says, that, possible, worlds, are, as, real, and, concrete, as, the, actual, world, since, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, interest, in, applied, ontology, has, risen, in, computer, and, information, science, with, the, development, of, conceptual, frameworks, for, specific, domains
