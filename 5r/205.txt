eastern, churches, are, 23, eastern, christian, autonomous, sui, iuris, particular, churches, of, the, catholic, church, in, full, communion, with, the, pope, in, rome, although, they, are, distinct, theologically, liturgically, and, historically, from, the, latin, church, they, are, all, in, full, communion, with, it, and, with, each, other, eastern, catholics, are, a, minority, within, the, catholic, church, of, the, 1, 3, billion, catholics, in, communion, with, the, pope, approximately, 18, million, are, members, of, the, eastern, churches, the, largest, numbers, of, eastern, catholics, may, be, found, in, eastern, europe, eastern, africa, the, middle, east, and, india, as, of, 2022, the, syro, malabar, church, is, the, largest, eastern, catholic, church, followed, by, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, with, the, exception, of, the, maronite, church, the, eastern, catholic, churches, are, groups, that, at, different, points, in, the, past, used, to, belong, to, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, or, the, church, of, the, east, these, churches, underwent, various, schisms, throughout, history, eastern, catholic, churches, formerly, part, of, other, communions, have, been, points, of, controversy, in, ecumenical, relations, with, the, eastern, orthodox, and, other, non, catholic, churches, the, five, historic, liturgical, traditions, of, eastern, christianity, comprising, the, alexandrian, rite, the, armenian, rite, the, byzantine, rite, the, east, syriac, rite, and, the, west, syriac, rite, are, all, represented, within, eastern, catholic, liturgy, on, occasion, this, leads, to, a, conflation, of, the, liturgical, word, rite, and, the, institutional, word, church, some, eastern, catholic, jurisdictions, admit, members, of, churches, not, in, communion, with, rome, to, the, eucharist, and, the, other, sacraments, full, communion, with, the, bishop, of, rome, constitutes, mutual, sacramental, sharing, between, the, eastern, catholic, churches, and, the, latin, church, and, the, recognition, of, papal, supremacy, provisions, within, the, 1983, latin, canon, law, and, the, 1990, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, govern, the, relationship, between, the, eastern, and, latin, churches, historically, pressure, to, conform, to, the, norms, of, the, western, christianity, practiced, by, the, majority, latin, church, led, to, a, degree, of, encroachment, latinization, on, some, of, the, eastern, catholic, traditions, the, second, vatican, council, document, orientalium, ecclesiarum, built, on, previous, reforms, to, reaffirm, the, right, of, eastern, catholics, to, maintain, their, distinct, practices, the, 1990, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, was, the, first, codified, body, of, canon, law, governing, the, eastern, catholic, churches, collectively, although, each, church, also, has, its, own, internal, canons, and, laws, on, top, of, this, members, of, eastern, catholic, churches, are, obliged, to, follow, the, norms, of, their, particular, church, regarding, celebration, of, church, feasts, marriage, and, other, customs, notable, distinct, norms, include, many, eastern, catholic, churches, regularly, allowing, the, ordination, of, married, men, to, the, priesthood, although, not, as, bishops, to, the, episcopacy, in, contrast, to, the, stricter, clerical, celibacy, of, latin, church, both, latin, and, eastern, catholics, may, freely, attend, a, catholic, liturgy, celebrated, in, any, rite, although, eastern, catholics, are, in, full, communion, with, the, pope, and, members, of, the, worldwide, catholic, church, they, are, not, members, of, the, latin, church, which, uses, the, latin, liturgical, rites, among, which, the, roman, rite, is, the, most, widespread, the, eastern, catholic, churches, are, instead, distinct, particular, churches, sui, iuris, although, they, maintain, full, and, equal, mutual, sacramental, exchange, with, members, of, the, latin, church, there, are, different, meanings, of, the, word, rite, apart, from, its, reference, to, the, liturgical, patrimony, of, a, particular, church, the, word, has, been, and, is, still, sometimes, even, if, rarely, officially, used, of, the, particular, church, itself, thus, the, term, latin, rite, can, refer, either, to, the, latin, church, or, to, one, or, more, of, the, latin, liturgical, rites, which, include, the, roman, rite, ambrosian, rite, mozarabic, rite, and, others, in, the, 1990, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, cceo, the, terms, autonomous, church, and, rite, are, thus, defined, a, group, of, christian, faithful, linked, in, accordance, with, the, law, by, a, hierarchy, and, expressly, or, tacitly, recognized, by, the, supreme, authority, of, the, church, as, autonomous, is, in, this, code, called, an, autonomous, church, canon, 27, when, speaking, of, eastern, catholic, churches, the, latin, church, s, 1983, code, of, canon, law, 1983, cic, uses, the, terms, ritual, church, or, ritual, church, sui, iuris, canons, 111, and, 112, and, also, speaks, of, a, subject, of, an, eastern, rite, canon, 1015, 2, ordinaries, of, another, rite, canon, 450, 1, the, faithful, of, a, specific, rite, canon, 476, etc, the, second, vatican, council, spoke, of, eastern, catholic, churches, as, particular, churches, or, rites, n, 2, in, 1999, the, united, states, conference, of, catholic, bishops, stated, we, have, been, accustomed, to, speaking, of, the, latin, roman, or, western, rite, or, the, eastern, rites, to, designate, these, different, churches, however, the, church, s, contemporary, legislation, as, contained, in, the, code, of, canon, law, and, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, makes, it, clear, that, we, ought, to, speak, not, of, rites, but, of, churches, canon, 112, of, the, code, of, canon, law, uses, the, phrase, autonomous, ritual, churches, to, designate, the, various, churches, and, a, writer, in, a, periodical, of, january, 2006, declared, the, eastern, churches, are, still, mistakenly, called, eastern, rite, churches, a, reference, to, their, various, liturgical, histories, they, are, most, properly, called, eastern, churches, or, eastern, catholic, churches, however, the, term, rite, continues, to, be, used, the, 1983, cic, forbids, a, latin, bishop, to, ordain, without, permission, of, the, holy, see, a, subject, of, his, who, is, of, an, eastern, rite, not, who, uses, an, eastern, rite, the, faculty, for, which, is, sometimes, granted, to, latin, clergy, the, term, uniat, or, uniate, has, been, applied, to, eastern, catholic, churches, and, individual, members, whose, church, hierarchies, were, previously, part, of, eastern, orthodox, or, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, term, is, sometimes, considered, derogatory, by, such, people, though, it, was, used, by, some, latin, and, eastern, catholics, prior, to, the, second, vatican, council, of, 1962, 1965, official, catholic, documents, no, longer, use, the, term, due, to, its, perceived, negative, overtones, eastern, catholic, churches, have, their, origins, in, the, middle, east, north, africa, east, africa, eastern, europe, and, south, india, however, since, the, 19th, century, diaspora, has, spread, to, western, europe, the, americas, and, oceania, in, part, because, of, persecution, where, eparchies, have, been, established, to, serve, adherents, alongside, those, of, latin, church, dioceses, latin, catholics, in, the, middle, east, on, the, other, hand, are, traditionally, cared, for, by, the, latin, patriarchate, of, jerusalem, communion, between, christian, churches, has, been, broken, over, matters, of, faith, whereby, each, side, accused, the, other, of, heresy, or, departure, from, the, true, faith, orthodoxy, communion, has, been, broken, also, because, of, disagreement, about, questions, of, authority, or, the, legitimacy, of, the, election, of, a, particular, bishop, in, these, latter, cases, each, side, accused, the, other, of, schism, but, not, of, heresy, the, following, ecumenical, councils, are, major, breaches, of, communion, in, 431, the, churches, that, accepted, the, teaching, of, the, council, of, ephesus, which, condemned, the, views, of, nestorius, classified, as, heretics, those, who, rejected, the, council, s, statements, the, church, of, the, east, which, was, mainly, under, the, sassanid, empire, never, accepted, the, council, s, views, it, later, experienced, a, period, of, great, expansion, in, asia, before, collapsing, after, the, mongol, invasion, of, the, middle, east, in, the, 14th, century, monuments, of, their, presence, still, exist, in, china, now, they, are, relatively, few, in, number, and, have, divided, into, three, churches, the, chaldean, catholic, church, an, eastern, catholic, church, in, full, communion, with, rome, and, two, assyrian, churches, which, are, not, in, communion, with, either, rome, or, each, other, the, chaldean, catholic, church, is, the, largest, of, the, three, the, groups, of, assyrians, who, did, not, reunify, with, rome, remained, and, are, known, as, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, which, experienced, an, internal, schism, in, 1968, which, led, to, the, creation, of, the, ancient, church, of, the, east, the, syro, malabar, and, syro, malankara, churches, are, the, two, eastern, catholic, descendants, of, the, church, of, the, east, in, the, indian, subcontinent, in, 451, those, who, accepted, the, council, of, chalcedon, similarly, classified, those, who, rejected, it, as, monophysite, heretics, the, churches, that, refused, to, accept, the, council, considered, instead, that, it, was, they, who, were, orthodox, they, reject, the, description, monophysite, meaning, only, nature, preferring, instead, miaphysite, meaning, one, nature, the, difference, in, terms, may, appear, subtle, but, it, is, theologically, very, important, monophysite, implies, a, single, divine, nature, alone, with, no, real, human, nature, a, heretical, belief, according, to, chalcedonian, christianity, whereas, miaphysite, can, be, understood, to, mean, one, nature, as, god, existing, in, the, person, of, jesus, who, is, both, human, and, divine, an, idea, more, easily, reconciled, to, chalcedonian, doctrine, they, are, often, called, in, english, oriental, orthodox, churches, to, distinguish, them, from, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, this, distinction, by, which, the, words, oriental, and, eastern, that, in, themselves, have, exactly, the, same, meaning, but, are, used, as, labels, to, describe, two, different, realities, is, impossible, to, translate, in, most, other, languages, and, is, not, universally, accepted, even, in, english, these, churches, are, also, referred, to, as, pre, chalcedonian, or, now, more, rarely, as, non, chalcedonian, or, anti, chalcedonian, in, languages, other, than, english, other, means, are, used, to, distinguish, the, two, families, of, churches, some, reserve, the, term, orthodox, for, those, that, are, here, called, eastern, orthodox, churches, but, members, of, what, are, called, oriental, orthodox, churches, consider, this, illicit, the, east, west, schism, came, about, in, the, context, of, cultural, differences, between, the, greek, speaking, east, and, latin, speaking, west, and, of, rivalry, between, the, churches, in, rome, which, claimed, a, primacy, not, merely, of, honour, but, also, of, authority, and, in, constantinople, which, claimed, parity, with, rome, the, rivalry, and, lack, of, comprehension, gave, rise, to, controversies, some, of, which, appear, already, in, the, acts, of, the, quinisext, council, of, 692, at, the, council, of, florence, 1431, 1445, these, controversies, about, western, theological, elaborations, and, usages, were, identified, as, chiefly, the, insertion, of, filioque, into, the, nicene, creed, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, for, the, eucharist, purgatory, and, the, authority, of, the, pope, the, schism, is, generally, considered, to, have, started, in, 1054, when, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, michael, i, cerularius, and, the, papal, legate, humbert, of, silva, candida, issued, mutual, excommunications, in, 1965, these, excommunications, were, revoked, by, both, rome, and, constantinople, in, spite, of, that, event, for, many, years, both, churches, continued, to, maintain, friendly, relations, and, seemed, to, be, unaware, of, any, formal, or, final, rupture, however, estrangement, continued, in, 1190, eastern, orthodox, theologian, theodore, balsamon, who, was, patriarch, of, antioch, wrote, that, no, latin, should, be, given, communion, unless, he, first, declares, that, he, will, abstain, from, the, doctrines, and, customs, that, separate, him, from, us, later, in, 1204, constantinople, was, sacked, by, the, catholic, armies, of, the, fourth, crusade, whereas, two, decades, previously, the, massacre, of, the, latins, i, e, catholics, had, occurred, in, constantinople, in, 1182, thus, by, the, 12th, 13th, centuries, the, two, sides, had, become, openly, hostile, each, considering, that, the, other, no, longer, belonged, to, the, church, that, was, orthodox, and, catholic, over, time, it, became, customary, to, refer, to, the, eastern, side, as, the, orthodox, church, and, the, western, as, the, catholic, church, without, either, side, thereby, renouncing, its, claim, of, being, the, truly, orthodox, or, the, truly, catholic, church, parties, within, many, non, latin, churches, repeatedly, sought, to, organize, efforts, to, restore, communion, in, 1438, the, council, of, florence, convened, which, featured, a, strong, dialogue, focused, on, understanding, the, theological, differences, between, the, east, and, west, with, the, hope, of, reuniting, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, several, eastern, churches, associated, themselves, with, rome, forming, eastern, catholic, churches, the, see, of, rome, accepted, them, without, requiring, that, they, adopt, the, customs, of, the, latin, church, so, that, they, all, have, their, own, liturgical, theological, spiritual, and, disciplinary, heritage, differentiated, by, peoples, culture, and, historical, circumstances, that, finds, expression, in, each, sui, iuris, church, s, own, way, of, living, the, faith, most, eastern, catholic, churches, arose, when, a, group, within, an, ancient, church, in, disagreement, with, the, see, of, rome, returned, to, full, communion, with, that, see, the, following, churches, have, been, in, communion, with, the, bishop, of, rome, for, a, large, part, of, their, history, the, canon, law, shared, by, all, eastern, catholic, churches, cceo, was, codified, in, 1990, the, dicastery, that, works, with, the, eastern, catholic, churches, is, the, dicastery, for, the, eastern, churches, which, by, law, includes, as, members, all, eastern, catholic, patriarchs, and, major, archbishops, the, largest, six, churches, based, on, membership, are, in, order, the, syro, malabar, church, east, syriac, rite, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, ugcc, byzantine, rite, the, maronite, church, west, syriac, rite, the, melkite, greek, catholic, church, byzantine, rite, the, chaldean, catholic, church, east, syriac, rite, and, the, armenian, catholic, church, armenian, rite, these, six, churches, account, for, about, 85, of, the, membership, of, the, eastern, catholic, churches, on, 30, november, 1894, pope, leo, xiii, issued, the, apostolic, constitution, orientalium, dignitas, in, which, he, stated, the, churches, of, the, east, are, worthy, of, the, glory, and, reverence, that, they, hold, throughout, the, whole, of, christendom, in, virtue, of, those, extremely, ancient, singular, memorials, that, they, have, bequeathed, to, us, for, it, was, in, that, part, of, the, world, that, the, first, actions, for, the, redemption, of, the, human, race, began, in, accord, with, the, all, kind, plan, of, god, they, swiftly, gave, forth, their, yield, there, flowered, in, first, blush, the, glories, of, preaching, the, true, faith, to, the, nations, of, martyrdom, and, of, holiness, they, gave, us, the, first, joys, of, the, fruits, of, salvation, from, them, has, come, a, wondrously, grand, and, powerful, flood, of, benefits, upon, the, other, peoples, of, the, world, no, matter, how, far, flung, when, blessed, peter, the, prince, of, the, apostles, intended, to, cast, down, the, manifold, wickedness, of, error, and, vice, in, accord, with, the, will, of, heaven, he, brought, the, light, of, divine, truth, the, gospel, of, peace, freedom, in, christ, to, the, metropolis, of, the, gentiles, adrian, fortescue, wrote, that, leo, xiii, begins, by, explaining, again, that, the, ancient, eastern, rites, are, a, witness, to, the, apostolicity, of, the, catholic, church, that, their, diversity, consistent, with, unity, of, the, faith, is, itself, a, witness, to, the, unity, of, the, church, that, they, add, to, her, dignity, and, honour, he, says, that, the, catholic, church, does, not, possess, one, rite, only, but, that, she, embraces, all, the, ancient, rites, of, christendom, her, unity, consists, not, in, a, mechanical, uniformity, of, all, her, parts, but, on, the, contrary, in, their, variety, according, in, one, principle, and, vivified, by, it, leo, xiii, declared, still, in, force, pope, benedict, xiv, s, encyclical, demandatam, addressed, to, the, patriarch, and, the, bishops, of, the, melkite, catholic, church, in, which, benedict, xiv, forbade, latin, church, clergy, to, induce, melkite, catholics, to, transfer, to, the, roman, rite, and, he, broadened, this, prohibition, to, cover, all, eastern, catholics, declaring, any, latin, rite, missionary, whether, of, the, secular, or, religious, clergy, who, induces, with, his, advice, or, assistance, any, eastern, rite, faithful, to, transfer, to, the, latin, rite, will, be, deposed, and, excluded, from, his, benefice, in, addition, to, the, ipso, facto, suspension, a, divinis, and, other, punishments, that, he, will, incur, as, imposed, in, the, aforesaid, constitution, demandatam, there, had, been, confusion, on, the, part, of, western, clergy, about, the, legitimate, presence, of, eastern, catholic, churches, in, countries, seen, as, belonging, to, the, west, despite, firm, and, repeated, papal, confirmation, of, these, churches, universal, character, the, second, vatican, council, brought, the, reform, impulse, to, visible, fruition, several, documents, from, both, during, and, after, the, second, vatican, council, have, led, to, significant, reform, and, development, within, eastern, catholic, churches, the, second, vatican, council, directed, in, orientalium, ecclesiarum, that, the, traditions, of, eastern, catholic, churches, should, be, maintained, it, declared, that, it, is, the, mind, of, the, catholic, church, that, each, individual, church, or, rite, should, retain, its, traditions, whole, and, entire, and, likewise, that, it, should, adapt, its, way, of, life, to, the, different, needs, of, time, and, place, n, 2, and, that, they, should, all, preserve, their, legitimate, liturgical, rite, and, their, established, way, of, life, and, these, may, not, be, altered, except, to, obtain, for, themselves, an, organic, improvement, n, 6, cf, n, 22, it, confirmed, and, approved, the, ancient, discipline, of, the, sacraments, existing, in, the, eastern, churches, and, the, ritual, practices, connected, with, their, celebration, and, administration, and, declared, its, ardent, desire, that, this, should, be, re, established, if, circumstances, warranted, n, 12, it, applied, this, in, particular, to, administration, of, sacrament, of, confirmation, by, priests, n, 13, it, expressed, the, wish, that, where, the, permanent, diaconate, ordination, as, deacons, of, men, who, are, not, intended, afterwards, to, become, priests, had, fallen, into, disuse, it, should, be, restored, n, 17, paragraphs, 7, 11, are, devoted, to, the, powers, of, the, patriarchs, and, major, archbishops, of, the, eastern, churches, whose, rights, and, privileges, it, says, should, be, re, established, in, accordance, with, the, ancient, tradition, of, each, of, the, churches, and, the, decrees, of, the, ecumenical, councils, adapted, somewhat, to, modern, conditions, where, there, is, need, new, patriarchates, should, be, established, either, by, an, ecumenical, council, or, by, the, bishop, of, rome, the, second, vatican, council, s, dogmatic, constitution, on, the, church, lumen, gentium, deals, with, eastern, catholic, churches, in, paragraph, 23, stating, by, divine, providence, it, has, come, about, that, various, churches, established, in, various, places, by, the, apostles, and, their, successors, have, in, the, course, of, time, coalesced, into, several, groups, organically, united, which, preserving, the, unity, of, faith, and, the, unique, divine, constitution, of, the, universal, church, enjoy, their, own, discipline, their, own, liturgical, usage, and, their, own, theological, and, spiritual, heritage, some, of, these, churches, notably, the, ancient, patriarchal, churches, as, parent, stocks, of, the, faith, so, to, speak, have, begotten, others, as, daughter, churches, with, which, they, are, connected, down, to, our, own, time, by, a, close, bond, of, charity, in, their, sacramental, life, and, in, their, mutual, respect, for, their, rights, and, duties, this, variety, of, local, churches, with, one, common, aspiration, is, splendid, evidence, of, the, catholicity, of, the, undivided, church, in, like, manner, the, episcopal, bodies, of, today, are, in, a, position, to, render, a, manifold, and, fruitful, assistance, so, that, this, collegiate, feeling, may, be, put, into, practical, application, the, 1964, decree, unitatis, redintegratio, deals, with, eastern, catholic, churches, in, paragraphs, 14, 17, the, first, vatican, council, discussed, the, need, for, a, common, code, for, the, eastern, churches, but, no, concrete, action, was, taken, only, after, the, benefits, of, the, latin, church, s, 1917, code, of, canon, law, were, appreciated, was, a, serious, effort, made, to, codify, the, eastern, catholic, churches, canon, laws, 27, this, came, to, fruition, with, the, promulgation, of, the, 1990, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, which, took, effect, in, 1991, it, is, a, framework, document, that, contains, canons, that, are, a, consequence, of, the, common, patrimony, of, the, churches, of, the, east, each, individual, sui, iuris, church, also, has, its, own, canons, its, own, particular, law, layered, on, top, of, this, code, in, 1993, the, joint, international, commission, for, theological, dialogue, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, church, submitted, the, document, uniatism, method, of, union, of, the, past, and, the, present, search, for, full, communion, also, known, as, the, balamand, declaration, to, the, authorities, of, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, for, approval, and, application, which, stated, that, initiatives, that, led, to, the, union, of, certain, communities, with, the, see, of, rome, and, brought, with, them, as, a, consequence, the, breaking, of, communion, with, their, mother, churches, of, the, east, took, place, not, without, the, interference, of, extra, ecclesial, interests, n, 8, likewise, the, commission, acknowledged, that, certain, civil, authorities, made, attempts, to, force, eastern, catholics, to, return, to, the, orthodox, church, used, unacceptable, means, n, 11, the, missionary, outlook, and, proselytism, that, accompanied, the, unia, n, 10, was, judged, incompatible, with, the, rediscovery, by, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, of, each, other, as, sister, churches, n, 12, thus, the, commission, concluded, that, the, missionary, apostolate, which, has, been, called, uniatism, can, no, longer, be, accepted, either, as, a, method, to, be, followed, or, as, a, model, of, the, unity, our, churches, are, seeking, n, 12, at, the, same, time, the, commission, stated, these, principles, were, repeated, in, the, 2016, joint, declaration, of, pope, francis, and, patriarch, kirill, which, stated, that, it, is, today, clear, that, the, past, method, of, uniatism, understood, as, the, union, of, one, community, to, the, other, separating, it, from, its, church, is, not, the, way, to, re, establish, unity, nonetheless, the, ecclesial, communities, which, emerged, in, these, historical, circumstances, have, the, right, to, exist, and, to, undertake, all, that, is, necessary, to, meet, the, spiritual, needs, of, their, faithful, while, seeking, to, live, in, peace, with, their, neighbours, orthodox, and, greek, catholics, are, in, need, of, reconciliation, and, of, mutually, acceptable, forms, of, co, existence, the, 1996, instruction, for, applying, the, liturgical, prescriptions, of, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, brought, together, in, one, place, the, developments, that, took, place, in, previous, texts, and, is, an, expository, expansion, based, upon, the, canons, with, constant, emphasis, upon, the, preservation, of, eastern, liturgical, traditions, and, a, return, to, those, usages, whenever, possible, certainly, in, preference, to, the, usages, of, the, latin, church, however, much, some, principles, and, norms, of, the, conciliar, constitution, on, the, roman, rite, in, the, very, nature, of, things, affect, other, rites, as, well, 998, the, instruction, states, the, liturgical, laws, valid, for, all, the, eastern, churches, are, important, because, they, provide, the, general, orientation, however, being, distributed, among, various, texts, they, risk, remaining, ignored, poorly, coordinated, and, poorly, interpreted, it, seemed, opportune, therefore, to, gather, them, in, a, systematic, whole, completing, them, with, further, clarification, thus, the, intent, of, the, instruction, presented, to, the, eastern, churches, which, are, in, full, communion, with, the, apostolic, see, is, to, help, them, fully, realize, their, own, identity, the, authoritative, general, directive, of, this, instruction, formulated, to, be, implemented, in, eastern, celebrations, and, liturgical, life, articulates, itself, in, propositions, of, a, juridical, pastoral, nature, constantly, taking, initiative, from, a, theological, perspective, n, 5, past, interventions, by, the, holy, see, the, instruction, said, were, in, some, ways, defective, and, needed, revision, but, often, served, also, as, a, safeguard, against, aggressive, initiatives, these, interventions, felt, the, effects, of, the, mentality, and, convictions, of, the, times, according, to, which, a, certain, subordination, of, the, non, latin, liturgies, was, perceived, toward, the, latin, rite, liturgy, which, was, considered, ritus, praestantior, this, attitude, may, have, led, to, interventions, in, the, eastern, liturgical, texts, which, today, in, light, of, theological, studies, and, progress, have, need, of, revision, in, the, sense, of, a, return, to, ancestral, traditions, the, work, of, the, commissions, nevertheless, availing, themselves, of, the, best, experts, of, the, times, succeeded, in, safeguarding, a, major, part, of, the, eastern, heritage, often, defending, it, against, aggressive, initiatives, and, publishing, precious, editions, of, liturgical, texts, for, numerous, eastern, churches, today, particularly, after, the, solemn, declarations, of, the, apostolic, letter, orientalium, dignitas, by, leo, xiii, after, the, creation, of, the, still, active, special, commission, for, the, liturgy, within, the, congregation, for, the, eastern, churches, in, 1931, and, above, all, after, the, second, vatican, council, and, the, apostolic, letter, orientale, lumen, by, john, paul, ii, respect, for, the, eastern, liturgies, is, an, indisputable, attitude, and, the, apostolic, see, can, offer, a, more, complete, service, to, the, churches, n, 24, under, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, the, pope, has, supreme, full, immediate, and, universal, ordinary, authority, in, the, whole, catholic, church, which, he, can, always, freely, exercise, including, the, eastern, catholic, churches, the, catholic, patriarchs, and, major, archbishops, derive, their, titles, from, the, sees, of, alexandria, coptic, antioch, syriac, melkite, maronite, baghdad, chaldean, cilicia, armenian, kyiv, halych, ukrainian, ernakulam, angamaly, syro, malabar, trivandrum, syro, malankara, and, f, g, ra, alba, iulia, romanian, the, eastern, catholic, churches, are, governed, in, accordance, with, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, and, their, particular, laws, within, their, proper, sui, iuris, churches, there, is, no, difference, between, patriarchs, and, major, archbishops, however, differences, exist, in, the, order, of, precedence, i, e, patriarchs, take, precedence, over, major, archbishops, and, in, the, mode, of, accession, the, election, of, a, major, archbishop, has, to, be, confirmed, by, the, pope, before, he, may, take, office, no, papal, confirmation, is, needed, for, newly, elected, patriarchs, before, they, take, office, they, are, just, required, to, request, as, soon, as, possible, that, the, pope, grant, them, full, ecclesiastical, communion, there, are, significant, differences, between, various, eastern, catholic, churches, regarding, their, present, organizational, structure, major, eastern, catholic, churches, that, are, headed, by, their, patriarchs, major, archbishops, or, metropolitans, have, fully, developed, structure, and, functioning, internal, autonomy, based, on, the, existence, of, ecclesiastical, provinces, on, the, other, hand, minor, eastern, catholic, churches, often, have, only, one, or, two, hierarchs, in, the, form, of, eparchs, apostolic, exarchs, or, apostolic, visitors, and, only, the, most, basic, forms, of, internal, organization, if, any, like, the, belarusian, greek, catholic, church, or, the, russian, greek, catholic, church, individual, eparchies, of, some, eastern, catholic, churches, may, be, suffragan, to, latin, metropolitans, for, example, the, greek, catholic, eparchy, of, kri, evci, is, suffragan, to, the, roman, catholic, archdiocese, of, zagreb, also, some, minor, eastern, catholic, churches, have, latin, prelates, for, example, the, macedonian, greek, catholic, church, is, organized, as, a, single, eparchy, of, strumica, skopje, whose, present, ordinary, is, the, roman, catholic, bishop, of, skopje, the, organization, of, the, albanian, greek, catholic, church, is, unique, in, that, it, consists, of, an, apostolic, administration, although, every, diocese, in, the, catholic, church, is, considered, a, particular, church, the, word, is, not, applied, in, the, same, sense, as, to, the, 24, sui, iuris, particular, churches, the, latin, church, and, the, 23, eastern, catholic, churches, canonically, each, eastern, catholic, church, is, sui, iuris, or, autonomous, with, respect, to, other, catholic, churches, whether, latin, or, eastern, though, all, accept, the, spiritual, and, juridical, supreme, authority, of, the, pope, thus, a, maronite, catholic, is, normally, directly, subject, only, to, a, maronite, bishop, however, if, members, of, a, particular, church, are, so, few, that, no, hierarchy, of, their, own, has, been, established, their, spiritual, care, is, entrusted, to, a, bishop, of, another, ritual, church, for, instance, members, of, the, latin, church, in, eritrea, are, under, the, care, of, the, eastern, rite, eritrean, catholic, church, whereas, the, other, way, around, may, be, the, case, in, other, parts, of, the, world, theologically, all, the, particular, churches, can, be, viewed, as, sister, churches, according, to, the, second, vatican, council, these, eastern, catholic, churches, along, with, the, larger, latin, church, share, equal, dignity, so, that, none, of, them, is, superior, to, the, others, as, regards, rite, and, they, enjoy, the, same, rights, and, are, under, the, same, obligations, also, in, respect, of, preaching, the, gospel, to, the, whole, world, cf, mark, 16, 15, under, the, guidance, of, the, roman, pontiff, n, 3, the, eastern, catholic, churches, are, in, full, communion, with, the, whole, catholic, church, while, they, accept, the, canonical, authority, of, the, holy, see, of, rome, they, retain, their, distinctive, liturgical, rites, laws, customs, and, traditional, devotions, and, have, their, own, theological, emphases, terminology, may, vary, for, instance, diocese, and, eparchy, vicar, general, and, protosyncellus, confirmation, and, chrismation, are, respectively, western, and, eastern, terms, for, the, same, realities, the, mysteries, sacraments, of, baptism, and, chrismation, are, generally, administered, according, to, the, ancient, tradition, of, the, church, one, immediately, after, the, other, infants, who, are, baptized, and, chrismated, are, also, given, the, eucharist, the, eastern, catholic, churches, are, represented, in, the, holy, see, and, the, roman, curia, through, the, dicastery, for, the, eastern, churches, which, is, made, up, of, a, cardinal, prefect, who, directs, and, represents, it, with, the, help, of, a, secretary, and, 27, cardinals, one, archbishop, and, 4, bishops, designated, by, the, pope, ad, quinquennium, for, a, five, year, period, members, by, right, are, the, patriarchs, and, the, major, archbishops, of, the, oriental, churches, and, the, president, of, the, pontifical, council, for, the, promotion, of, unity, among, christians, while, clerics, and, members, of, institutes, of, consecrated, life, are, bound, to, observe, their, own, rite, faithfully, priests, are, occasionally, given, permission, to, celebrate, the, liturgy, of, a, rite, other, than, the, priest, s, own, rite, by, what, is, known, as, a, grant, of, biritual, faculties, the, reason, for, this, permission, is, usually, the, service, of, catholics, who, have, no, priest, of, their, own, rite, thus, priests, of, the, syro, malabar, church, working, as, missionaries, in, areas, of, india, in, which, there, are, no, structures, of, their, own, church, are, authorized, to, use, the, roman, rite, in, those, areas, and, latin, priests, are, after, due, preparation, given, permission, to, use, an, eastern, rite, for, the, service, of, members, of, an, eastern, catholic, church, living, in, a, country, in, which, there, are, no, priests, of, their, own, particular, church, popes, are, permitted, to, celebrate, a, mass, or, divine, liturgy, of, any, rite, in, testament, to, the, catholic, church, s, universal, nature, john, paul, ii, celebrated, the, divine, liturgy, in, ukraine, during, his, pontificate, for, a, just, cause, and, with, the, permission, of, the, local, bishop, priests, of, different, autonomous, ritual, churches, may, concelebrate, however, the, rite, of, the, principal, celebrant, is, used, whilst, each, priest, wears, the, vestments, of, his, own, rite, no, indult, of, bi, ritualism, is, required, for, this, biritual, faculties, may, concern, not, only, clergy, but, also, religious, enabling, them, to, become, members, of, an, institute, of, an, autonomous, church, other, than, their, own, eastern, and, western, christian, churches, have, different, traditions, concerning, clerical, celibacy, and, the, resulting, controversies, have, played, a, role, in, the, relationship, between, the, two, groups, in, some, western, countries, in, general, eastern, catholic, churches, have, always, allowed, ordination, of, married, men, as, priests, and, deacons, within, the, lands, of, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, the, second, largest, eastern, catholic, church, where, 90, of, the, diocesan, priests, in, ukraine, are, married, priests, children, often, became, priests, and, married, within, their, social, group, establishing, a, tightly, knit, hereditary, caste, most, eastern, churches, distinguish, between, monastic, and, non, monastic, clergy, monastics, do, not, necessarily, live, in, monasteries, but, have, spent, at, least, part, of, their, period, of, training, in, such, a, context, their, monastic, vows, include, a, vow, of, celibate, chastity, bishops, are, normally, selected, from, the, monastic, clergy, and, in, most, eastern, catholic, churches, a, large, percentage, of, priests, and, deacons, also, are, celibate, while, a, large, portion, of, the, parish, priests, are, married, having, taken, a, wife, when, they, were, still, laymen, if, someone, preparing, for, the, diaconate, or, priesthood, wishes, to, marry, this, must, happen, before, ordination, in, territories, where, eastern, traditions, prevail, married, clergy, caused, little, controversy, but, aroused, opposition, inside, traditionally, latin, church, territories, to, which, eastern, catholics, migrated, this, was, particularly, so, in, the, united, states, in, response, to, requests, from, the, latin, bishops, of, those, countries, the, congregation, for, the, propagation, of, the, faith, set, out, rules, in, an, 1890, letter, to, fran, ois, marie, benjamin, richard, archbishop, of, paris, which, the, congregation, applied, on, 1, may, 1897, to, the, united, states, stating, that, only, celibates, or, widowed, priests, coming, without, their, children, should, be, permitted, in, the, united, states, this, celibacy, mandate, for, eastern, catholic, priests, in, the, united, states, was, restated, with, special, reference, to, ruthenians, by, the, 1, march, 1929, decree, cum, data, fuerit, which, was, renewed, for, a, further, ten, years, in, 1939, dissatisfaction, by, many, ruthenian, catholics, in, the, united, states, gave, rise, to, the, american, carpatho, russian, orthodox, diocese, the, mandate, which, applied, in, some, other, countries, also, was, removed, by, a, decree, of, june, 2014, while, most, eastern, catholic, churches, admit, married, men, to, ordination, as, priests, although, not, allowing, priests, to, marry, after, ordination, some, have, adopted, mandatory, clerical, celibacy, as, in, the, latin, church, these, include, the, india, based, syro, malankara, catholic, church, and, syro, malabar, catholic, church, and, the, coptic, catholic, church, in, 2014, pope, francis, approved, new, norms, for, married, clergy, within, eastern, catholic, churches, through, cceo, canon, 758, 3, the, new, norms, abrogated, previous, norms, and, now, allow, those, eastern, catholic, churches, with, married, clergy, to, ordain, married, men, inside, traditionally, latin, territories, and, to, grant, faculties, inside, traditionally, latin, territories, to, married, eastern, catholic, clergy, previously, ordained, elsewhere, this, latter, change, will, allow, married, eastern, catholic, priests, to, follow, their, faithful, to, whatever, country, they, may, immigrate, to, addressing, an, issue, which, has, arisen, with, the, exodus, of, so, many, christians, from, eastern, europe, and, the, middle, east, in, recent, decades, the, holy, see, s, annuario, pontificio, gives, the, following, list, of, eastern, catholic, churches, with, the, principal, episcopal, see, of, each, and, the, countries, or, larger, political, areas, where, they, have, ecclesiastical, jurisdiction, to, which, are, here, added, the, date, of, union, or, foundation, in, parentheses, and, the, membership, in, brackets, the, total, membership, for, all, eastern, catholic, churches, is, at, least, 18, 047, 000, people, a, study, by, methodios, stadnik, states, the, georgian, byzantine, catholic, exarch, fr, shio, batmanishviii, and, two, georgian, catholic, priests, of, the, latin, church, were, executed, by, the, soviet, authorities, in, 1937, after, having, been, held, in, captivity, in, solovki, prison, and, the, northern, gulags, from, 1923, christopher, zugger, writes, in, the, forgotten, by, 1936, the, byzantine, catholic, church, of, georgia, had, two, communities, served, by, a, bishop, and, four, priests, with, 8, 000, believers, and, he, identifies, the, bishop, as, shio, batmalashvili, vasyl, ovsiyenko, mentions, on, the, ukrainian, helsinki, human, rights, union, website, that, the, catholic, administrator, for, georgia, shio, batmalashvili, was, one, of, those, executed, as, anti, soviet, elements, in, 1937, zugger, calls, batmalashvili, a, bishop, stadnik, is, ambiguous, calling, him, an, exarch, but, giving, him, the, title, of, father, ovsiyenko, merely, refers, to, him, as, the, catholic, administrator, without, specifying, whether, he, was, a, bishop, or, a, priest, and, whether, he, was, in, charge, of, a, latin, or, a, byzantine, jurisdiction, if, batmalashvili, was, an, exarch, and, not, instead, a, bishop, connected, with, the, latin, diocese, of, tiraspol, which, had, its, seat, at, saratov, on, the, volga, river, to, which, georgian, catholics, even, of, byzantine, rite, belonged, this, would, mean, that, a, georgian, byzantine, rite, catholic, church, existed, even, if, only, as, a, local, particular, church, however, since, the, establishment, of, a, new, hierarchical, jurisdiction, must, be, published, in, acta, apostolicae, sedis, and, no, mention, of, the, setting, up, of, such, a, jurisdiction, for, byzantine, georgian, catholics, exists, in, that, official, gazette, of, the, holy, see, the, claim, appears, to, be, unfounded, the, 1930s, editions, of, annuario, pontificio, do, not, mention, batmalashvili, if, indeed, he, was, a, bishop, he, may, then, have, been, one, of, those, secretly, ordained, for, the, service, of, the, church, in, the, soviet, union, by, french, jesuit, bishop, michel, d, herbigny, who, was, president, of, the, pontifical, commission, for, russia, from, 1925, to, 1934, in, the, circumstances, of, that, time, the, holy, see, would, have, been, incapable, of, setting, up, a, new, byzantine, exarchate, within, the, soviet, union, since, greek, catholics, in, the, soviet, union, were, being, forced, to, join, the, russian, orthodox, church, batmalashvili, s, name, is, not, among, those, given, in, as, the, four, underground, apostolic, administrators, only, one, of, whom, appears, to, have, been, a, bishop, for, the, four, sections, into, which, the, diocese, of, tiraspol, was, divided, after, the, resignation, in, 1930, of, its, already, exiled, last, bishop, josef, alois, kessler, this, source, gives, father, stefan, demurow, as, apostolic, administrator, of, tbilisi, and, georgia, and, says, he, was, executed, in, 1938, other, sources, associate, demurow, with, azerbaijan, and, say, that, rather, than, being, executed, he, died, in, a, siberian, gulag, until, 1994, the, united, states, annual, publication, catholic, almanac, listed, georgian, among, the,

movement, among, the, ethnic, estonians, in, the, orthodox, church, in, estonia, during, the, interwar, period, of, the, 20th, century, consisting, of, two, to, three, parishes, not, raised, to, the,
