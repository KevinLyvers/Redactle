in, greek, mythology, perseus, us, p, r, s, i, s, uk, p, sj, u, s, greek, translit, perse, s, is, the, legendary, founder, of, the, perseid, dynasty, he, was, alongside, cadmus, and, bellerophon, the, greatest, greek, hero, and, slayer, of, monsters, before, the, days, of, heracles, he, beheaded, the, gorgon, medusa, for, polydectes, and, saved, andromeda, from, the, sea, monster, cetus, he, was, the, son, of, zeus, and, the, mortal, dana, as, well, as, the, half, brother, and, great, grandfather, of, heracles, as, they, were, both, children, of, zeus, and, heracles, mother, was, descended, from, perseus, because, of, the, obscurity, of, the, name, perseus, and, the, legendary, character, of, its, bearer, most, etymologists, presume, that, it, might, be, pre, greek, however, the, name, of, perseus, s, native, city, was, greek, and, so, were, the, names, of, his, wife, and, relatives, there, is, some, idea, that, it, descended, into, greek, from, the, proto, indo, european, language, in, that, regard, graves, proposed, the, only, greek, derivation, available, perseus, might, be, from, the, greek, verb, p, rthein, to, waste, ravage, sack, destroy, some, form, of, which, is, familiar, in, homeric, epithets, according, to, buck, the, eus, suffix, is, typically, used, to, form, an, agent, noun, in, this, case, from, the, aorist, stem, pers, pers, eus, therefore, is, a, sacker, that, is, a, soldier, by, occupation, a, fitting, name, for, the, first, mycenaean, warrior, the, further, origin, of, perth, is, more, obscure, hofmann, lists, the, possible, root, as, bher, from, which, latin, ferio, strike, this, corresponds, to, pokorny, s, bher, 3, scrape, cut, ordinarily, bh, descends, to, greek, as, ph, this, difficulty, can, be, overcome, by, presuming, a, dissimilation, from, the, th, in, p, rthein, which, the, greeks, would, have, preferred, from, a, putative, ph, rthein, graves, carries, the, meaning, still, further, to, the, perse, in, persephone,

etymology, connected, perseus, to, the, name, of, the, persian, people, whom, they, called, the, p, rsai, from, old, persian, p, rsa, persia, a, persian, however, the, native, name, of, the, persians, p, rsa, in, persian, has, always, been, pronounced, with, an, a, herodotus, recounts, this, story, devising, a, foreign, son, of, andromeda, and, perseus, perses, from, whom, the, persians, took, the, name, apparently, the, persians, also, knew, that, story, as, xerxes, tried, to, use, it, when, bribing, the, argives, during, his, invasion, of, greece, but, ultimately, failed, to, do, this, king, acrisius, of, argos, had, only, one, child, a, daughter, named, dana, disappointed, by, not, having, a, male, heir, acrisius, consulted, the, oracle, at, delphi, who, warned, him, that, he, would, one, day, be, killed, by, his, own, grandson, to, keep, dana, childless, acrisius, imprisoned, her, in, a, room, atop, a, bronze, tower, in, the, courtyard, of, his, palace, this, mytheme, is, also, connected, to, ares, oenopion, eurystheus, and, others, zeus, came, to, her, in, the, form, of, a, shower, of, gold, and, fathered, her, child, soon, after, their, child, a, son, was, born, perseus, perseus, eurymedon, for, his, mother, gave, him, this, name, as, well, fearful, for, his, future, but, unwilling, to, provoke, the, wrath, of, the, gods, and, the, erinyes, by, killing, the, offspring, of, zeus, and, his, daughter, acrisius, cast, the, two, into, the, sea, in, a, wooden, chest, dana, s, fearful, prayer, made, while, afloat, in, the, darkness, has, been, expressed, by, the, poet, simonides, of, ceos, mother, and, child, washed, ashore, on, the, island, of, seriphos, where, they, were, taken, in, by, the, fisherman, dictys, fishing, net, who, raised, the, boy, to, manhood, the, brother, of, dictys, was, polydectes, he, who, receives, welcomes, many, the, king, of, the, island, when, perseus, was, grown, polydectes, came, to, lust, for, the, beautiful, dana, perseus, believed, polydectes, was, less, than, honorable, and, protected, his, mother, from, him, then, polydectes, plotted, to, send, perseus, away, in, disgrace, he, held, a, large, banquet, where, each, guest, was, expected, to, bring, a, gift, polydectes, requested, that, the, guests, bring, horses, under, the, pretense, that, he, was, collecting, contributions, for, the, hand, of, hippodamia, daughter, of, oinomaos, perseus, had, no, horse, to, give, so, he, asked, polydectes, to, name, the, gift, he, would, not, refuse, it, polydectes, held, perseus, to, his, rash, promise, and, demanded, the, snake, haired, medusa, s, head, medusa, and, her, two, immortal, older, sisters, stheno, and, euryale, were, gorgons, monsters, with, snakes, for, hair, sharp, fangs, and, claws, wings, of, gold, and, gazes, that, turned, people, to, stone, before, setting, out, on, his, quest, perseus, prayed, to, the, gods, and, zeus, answered, by, sending, two, of, his, other, children, hermes, and, athena, to, bless, their, half, brother, with, the, weapons, needed, to, defeat, medusa, hermes, gave, perseus, his, own, pair, of, winged, sandals, to, fly, with, and, lent, him, his, harpe, sword, to, slay, medusa, with, and, hades, helm, of, darkness, to, become, invisible, with, athena, lent, perseus, her, polished, shield, for, him, to, view, medusa, s, reflection, without, becoming, petrified, and, gave, him, a, kibisis, a, knapsack, to, safely, contain, the, gorgon, s, head, which, the, goddess, warned, could, still, petrify, even, in, death, lastly, athena, instructed, perseus, to, seek, out, the, graeae, the, gorgons, sisters, for, the, snake, haired, women, s, whereabouts, in, other, versions, it, was, the, hesperides, nymphs, who, gave, perseus, the, weapons, after, he, sought, out, the, graeae, following, athena, s, guidance, perseus, found, the, graeae, who, were, three, old, swan, shaped, witches, sharing, a, single, eye, and, a, single, tooth, as, the, witches, passed, their, eye, from, one, to, another, perseus, snatched, it, from, them, holding, it, for, ransom, in, return, for, the, gorgons, location, the, graeae, informed, perseus, that, the, gorgons, lived, on, the, island, of, sarpedon, perseus, then, gave, the, graeae, their, eye, back, and, proceeded, to, the, island, on, the, island, of, sarpedon, perseus, came, across, a, cave, where, stheno, euryale, and, medusa, lay, sleeping, using, athena, s, reflective, shield, perseus, overcame, the, looking, taboo, walked, into, the, cave, backwards, safely, observing, and, approaching, the, sleeping, gorgons, with, athena, guiding, the, sword, perseus, beheaded, medusa, from, medusa, s, neck, sprang, her, two, children, with, poseidon, the, winged, horse, pegasus, he, who, sprang, and, the, giant, chrysaor, sword, of, gold, to, avenge, their, sister, s, death, stheno, and, euryale, flew, after, perseus, but, he, escaped, them, by, wearing, hades, invisibility, helm, from, here, he, proceeded, to, visit, king, atlas, who, had, refused, him, hospitality, in, revenge, perseus, petrified, him, with, medusa, s, head, and, king, atlas, became, the, atlas, mountains, on, the, way, back, to, seriphos, perseus, stopped, in, the, kingdom, of, aethiopia, this, mythical, ethiopia, was, ruled, by, king, cepheus, and, queen, cassiopeia, cassiopeia, having, boasted, that, her, daughter, andromeda, was, more, beautiful, than, the, nereids, drew, the, vengeance, of, poseidon, who, sent, an, inundation, on, the, land, and, a, sea, serpent, cetus, which, destroyed, man, and, beast, the, oracle, of, ammon, announced, that, no, relief, would, be, found, until, the, king, sacrificed, his, daughter, andromeda, to, the, monster, and, so, she, was, fastened, naked, to, a, rock, on, the, shore, wearing, the, winged, sandals, given, to, him, by, hermes, perseus, reached, andromeda, and, used, the, harpe, to, behead, the, monster, in, other, versions, perseus, used, medusa, s, head, to, petrify, cetus, by, rescuing, andromeda, perseus, claimed, her, in, marriage, perseus, married, andromeda, in, spite, of, phineus, to, whom, she, had, been, previously, engaged, at, the, wedding, a, quarrel, took, place, between, the, rivals, and, phineus, was, petrified, by, the, sight, of, medusa, s, head, andromeda, queen, of, men, followed, her, husband, to, tiryns, in, argos, and, became, the, ancestress, of, the, family, of, the, perseidae, who, ruled, at, tiryns, through, her, son, with, perseus, perses, after, her, death, she, was, placed, by, athena, among, the, constellations, in, the, northern, sky, near, perseus, and, cassiopeia, sophocles, and, euripides, and, in, more, modern, times, pierre, corneille, made, the, episode, of, perseus, and, andromeda, the, subject, of, tragedies, and, its, incidents, were, represented, in, many, ancient, works, of, art, as, perseus, was, flying, in, his, return, above, the, sands, of, libya, according, to, apollonius, of, rhodes, the, falling, drops, of, medusa, s, blood, created, a, race, of, toxic, serpents, one, of, whom, was, to, kill, the, argonaut, mopsus, upon, returning, to, seriphos, and, discovering, that, his, mother, had, to, take, refuge, from, the, violent, advances, of, polydectes, perseus, killed, him, with, medusa, s, head, and, made, dictys, the, new, king, of, seriphos, perseus, then, returned, his, magical, loans, and, gave, medusa, s, head, as, a, votive, gift, to, athena, who, set, it, on, her, aegis, which, zeus, gave, her, as, the, gorgoneion, the, fulfillment, of, the, oracle, was, told, several, ways, each, incorporating, the, mythic, theme, of, exile, in, pausanias, he, did, not, return, to, argos, but, went, instead, to, larissa, where, athletic, games, were, being, held, he, had, just, invented, the, quoit, and, was, making, a, public, display, of, them, when, acrisius, who, happened, to, be, visiting, stepped, into, the, trajectory, of, the, quoit, and, was, killed, thus, the, oracle, was, fulfilled, this, is, an, unusual, variant, on, the, story, of, such, a, prophecy, as, acrisius, actions, did, not, in, this, variant, cause, his, death, in, the, bibliotheca, the, inevitable, occurred, by, another, route, perseus, did, return, to, argos, but, when, acrisius, learned, of, his, grandson, s, approach, mindful, of, the, oracle, he, went, into, voluntary, exile, in, pelasgiotis, thessaly, there, teutamides, king, of, larissa, was, holding, funeral, games, for, his, father, competing, in, the, discus, throw, perseus, throw, veered, and, struck, acrisius, killing, him, instantly, in, a, third, tradition, acrisius, had, been, driven, into, exile, by, his, brother, proetus, perseus, petrified, the, brother, with, medusa, s, head, and, restored, acrisius, to, the, throne, then, accused, by, acrisius, of, lying, about, having, slain, medusa, perseus, proves, himself, by, showing, acrisius, the, gorgon, s, head, thus, fulfilling, the, prophecy, having, killed, acrisius, perseus, who, was, next, in, line, for, the, throne, gave, the, kingdom, to, megapenthes, great, mourning, son, of, proetus, and, took, over, megapenthes, kingdom, of, tiryns, the, story, is, related, in, pausanias, who, gives, as, motivation, for, the, swap, that, perseus, was, ashamed, to, have, become, king, of, argos, by, inflicting, death, in, any, case, early, greek, literature, reiterates, that, manslaughter, even, involuntary, requires, the, exile, of, the, slaughterer, expiation, and, ritual, purification, the, exchange, might, well, have, proved, a, creative, solution, to, a, difficult, problem, the, two, main, sources, regarding, the, legendary, life, of, perseus, for, the, greeks, considered, him, an, authentic, historical, figure, are, pausanias, and, the, bibliotheca, pausanias, asserts, that, the, greeks, believed, perseus, founded, mycenae, he, mentions, the, shrine, to, perseus, that, stood, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, road, from, mycenae, to, argos, and, also, a, sacred, fountain, at, mycenae, called, persea, located, outside, the, walls, this, was, perhaps, the, spring, that, filled, the, citadel, s, underground, cistern, he, states, also, that, atreus, stored, his, treasures, in, an, underground, chamber, there, which, is, why, heinrich, schliemann, named, the, largest, tholos, tomb, the, treasury, of, atreus, apart, from, these, more, historical, references, the, only, accounts, of, him, are, from, folk, etymology, perseus, dropped, his, cap, or, found, a, mushroom, both, named, myces, at, mycenae, or, perhaps, the, place, was, named, after, the, lady, mycene, daughter, of, inachus, mentioned, in, a, now, fragmentary, poem, the, megalai, ehoiai, for, whatever, reasons, perhaps, as, outposts, perseus, fortified, mycenae, according, to, apollodorus, along, with, midea, an, action, that, implies, that, they, both, previously, existed, it, is, unlikely, however, that, apollodorus, knew, who, walled, in, mycenae, he, was, only, conjecturing, perseus, took, up, official, residence, in, mycenae, with, andromeda, where, he, had, a, long, successful, reign, as, king, according, to, the, suda, perseus, after, he, married, andromeda, founded, a, city, and, called, it, amandra, in, the, city, there, was, a, stele, depicting, the, gorgon, the, city, later, changed, the, name, to, ikonion, because, it, had, the, depiction, of, the, gorgon, then, he, fought, the, isaurians, and, the, cilicians, and, founded, the, city, of, tarsus, because, an, oracle, told, him, to, found, a, city, in, the, place, where, after, the, victory, the, flat, of, his, foot, will, touch, the, earth, while, he, is, dismounting, from, his, horse, then, he, conquered, the, medes, and, changed, the, name, of, the, country, to, persia, at, persia, he, taught, the, magi, about, the, gorgon, and, when, a, fireball, fell, from, the, sky, he, took, the, fire, and, gave, it, to, the, people, to, guard, and, revere, it, later, during, a, war, he, tried, to, use, medusa, s, head, again, but, because, he, was, old, and, could, not, see, well, the, head, did, not, work, because, he, thought, that, it, was, useless, he, turned, it, toward, himself, and, he, died, later, his, son, merros, burned, the, head, perseus, and, andromeda, had, seven, sons, perses, alcaeus, heleus, mestor, sthenelus, electryon, and, cynurus, and, two, daughters, gorgophone, and, autochthe, perses, was, left, in, aethiopia, and, was, believed, to, have, been, an, ancestor, of, the, persians, the, other, descendants, ruled, mycenae, from, electryon, to, eurystheus, after, whom, atreus, got, the, kingdom, however, the, perseids, included, the, great, hero, heracles, stepson, of, amphitryon, son, of, alcaeus, the, heraclides, or, descendants, of, heracles, successfully, contested, the, rule, of, the, atreids, a, statement, by, the, athenian, orator, isocrates, helps, to, date, perseus, approximately, he, said, that, heracles, was, four, generations, later, than, perseus, which, corresponds, to, the, legendary, succession, perseus, electryon, alcmena, and, heracles, who, was, a, contemporary, of, eurystheus, atreus, was, one, generation, later, a, total, of, five, generations, the, replacement, of, bellerophon, as, the, tamer, and, rider, of, pegasus, by, the, more, familiar, culture, hero, perseus, was, not, simply, an, error, of, painters, and, poets, of, the, renaissance, the, transition, was, a, development, of, classical, times, which, became, the, standard, image, during, the, middle, ages, and, has, been, adopted, by, the, european, poets, of, the, renaissance, and, later, giovanni, boccaccio, s, genealogia, deorum, gentilium, libri, 10, 27, identifies, pegasus, as, the, steed, of, perseus, and, pierre, corneille, places, perseus, upon, pegasus, in, androm, de, various, modern, representations, of, pegasus, depict, the, winged, horse, with, perseus, including, the, fantasy, film, clash, of, the, titans, and, its, 2010, remake, male, female, deity, perseus, has, a, constellation, named, after, him, the, legend, says, that, because, he, was, so, brave, fighting, cetus, for, someone, else, he, was, given, a, place, in, the, stars, forever, it, is, located, in, the, east, in, the, winter, at, about, the, latitude, 10, n, it, is, not, far, from, the, stars, betelgeuse, and, sirius, his, wife, s, constellation, andromeda, is, also, nearby, it, is, southward, from, cassiopeia, and, to, the, left, of, taurus, his, constellation, contains, the, most, famous, variable, star, algol, and,
