ultimate, triumph, of, ahura, mazda, over, evil, opinions, vary, among, scholars, as, to, whether, the, religion, is, monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, or, a, combination, of, all, three, zoroastrianism, shaped, iranian, culture, and, history, while, scholars, differ, on, whether, it, significantly, influenced, ancient, western, philosophy, and, the, abrahamic, religions, or, gradually, reconciled, with, other, religions, and, traditions, such, as, christianity, and, islam, originating, from, zoroaster, s, reforms, of, the, ancient, iranian, religion, zoroastrianism, may,

official, religion, of, successive, iranian, polities, beginning, with, the, achaemenid, empire, which, formalized, and, institutionalized, many, of, its, tenets, and, rituals, through, the, sasanian, empire, which, revitalized, the, faith, and, standardized, its, teachings, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, in, the, mid, seventh, century, ce, zoroastrianism, declined, amid, persecution, and, forced, conversions, by, the, early, muslims, many, zoroastrians, fled, to, the, indian, subcontinent, as, refugees, and, became, the, progenitors, of, today, s, parsis, once,

the, gathas, purported, to, be, the, direct, teachings, of, zoroaster, and, his, account, of, conversations, with, ahura, mazda, these, writings, are, part, of, a, major, section, of, the, avesta, called, the, yasna, which, forms, the, core, of, zoroastrian, liturgy, zoroaster, s, religious, philosophy, divided, the, early, iranian, gods, of, proto, indo, iranian, paganism, into, emanations, of, the, natural, world, known, as, ahuras, and, daevas, the, former, are, to, be, revered, and, the, latter, rejected, zoroaster, proclaimed, that, ahura, mazda, was, the, supreme, creator, and, sustaining, force, of, the, universe, working, in, g, t, g, the, visible, material, realm, and, m, n, g, the, invisible, spiritual, and, mental, realm, through, seven, amesha, spentas, which,

priestly, titles, of, osta, osti, ervad, hirbod, mobed, and, dastur, the, first, surviving, reference, to, zoroaster, in, english, scholarship, is, attributed, to, thomas, browne, 1605, 1682, who,

monotheistic, religions, in, the, world, zoroastrians, treat, ahura, mazda, as, the, supreme, god, but, believe, in, lesser, divinities, known, as, yazatas, who, share, some, similarities, with, the, angels, in, abrahamic, religions, these, yazatas, good, agents, include, anahita, sraosha, mithra, rashnu, and, tishtrya, historian, richard, foltz, has, put, forth, evidence, that, iranians, of, pre, islamic, era, worshipped, all, these, figures, especially, the, gods, mithra, and, anahita, prods, oktor, skj, rv, states, zoroastrianism, is, henotheistic, and, a, dualistic, and, polytheistic, religion, but, with, one, supreme, god, who, is, the, father, of, the, ordered, cosmos, brian, arthur, brown, states, that, this, is, unclear, because, historic, texts, present, a, conflicting, picture, ranging, from, zoroastrianism, s, belief, in, one, god, two, gods, or, a, best, god, henotheism, economist, mario, ferrero, suggests, that, zoroastrianism, transitioned, from, polytheism, to, monotheism, due, to, political, and, economic, pressures, in, the, 19th, century, through, contact, with, western, academics, and, missionaries, zoroastrianism, experienced, a, massive, theological, change, that, still, affects, it, today, the, rev, john, wilson, led, various, missionary, campaigns, in, india, against, the, parsi, community, disparaging, the, parsis, for, their, dualism, and, polytheism, and, as, having, unnecessary, rituals, while, declaring, the, avesta, to, not, be, divinely, inspired, this, caused, mass, dismay, in, the, relatively, uneducated, parsi, community, which, blamed, its, priests, and, led, to, some, conversions, towards, christianity, the, arrival, of, the, german, orientalist, and, philologist, martin, haug, led, to, a, rallied, defense, of, the, faith, through, haug, s, reinterpretation, of, the, avesta, through, christianized, and, european, orientalist, lens, haug, postulated, that, zoroastrianism, was, solely, monotheistic, with, all, other, divinities, reduced, to, the, status, of, angels, while, ahura, mazda, became, both, omnipotent, and, the, source, of, evil, as, well, as, good, haug, s, thinking, was, subsequently, disseminated, as, a, parsi, interpretation, thus, corroborating, haug, s, theory, and, the, idea, became, so, popular, that, it, is, now, almost, universally, accepted, as, doctrine, though, being, reevaluated, in, modern, zoroastrianism, and, academia, it, has, been, argued, by, almut, hintze, that, this, designation, of, monotheism, is, not, wholly, perfect, and, that, zoroastrianism, instead, has, its, own, form, of, monotheism, which, combines, elements, of, dualism, and, polytheism, farhang, mehr, asserts, that, zoroastrianism, is, principally, monotheistic, with, some, dualistic, elements, lenorant, and, chevallier, assert, that, zoroastrianism, s, concept, of, divinity, covers, both, being, and, mind, as, immanent, entities, describing, zoroastrianism, as, having, a, belief, in, an, immanent, self, creating, universe, with, consciousness, as, its, special, attribute, thereby, putting, zoroastrianism, in, the, pantheistic, fold, sharing, its, origin, with, indian, hinduism, zoroastrianism, contains, multiple, classes, of, divine, beings, who, are, typically, organised, into, tiers, and, spheres, of, influence, the, ahura, are, a, class, of, divine, beings, inherited, by, zoroastrianism, from, the, prehistoric, indo, iranian, religion, in, the, rig, veda, asura, denotes, the, older, gods, such, as, the, father, asura, varuna, and, mitra, who, originally, ruled, over, the, primeval, undifferentiated, chaos, ahura, mazda, also, known, as, oromasdes, ohrmazd, ormazd, ormusd, hoormazd, harzoo, hormazd, hormaz, and, hurmz, is, the, creator, deity, and, the, supreme, god, in, zoroastrianism, ahura, mazda, stands, for, the, dual, deity, mitr, v, ru, of, the, hindu, holy, book, known, as, the, rigveda, according, to, scholars, ahura, mazda, is, an, uncreated, omniscient, omnipotent, and, benevolent, god, who, has, created, the, spiritual, and, material, existences, out, of, infinite, light, and, maintains, the, cosmic, law, of, asha, he, is, the, first, and, most, invoked, spirit, in, yasna, and, is, unrivaled, has, no, equals, and, presides, over, all, creation, in, avesta, ahura, mazda, is, the, only, true, god, and, the, representation, of, goodness, light, and, truth, he, is, in, conflict, with, the, evil, spirit, angra, mainyu, the, representation, of, evil, darkness, and, deceit, angru, mainyu, s, goal, is, to, tempt, humans, away, from, ahura, mazda, notably, angra, mainyu, is, not, a, creation, of, ahura, mazda, but, an, independent, entity, the, belief, in, ahura, mazda, the, lord, of, wisdom, who, is, considered, an, all, encompassing, deity, and, the, only, existing, one, is, the, foundation, of, zoroastrianism, mitra, also, called, mithra, was, originally, an, indo, iranian, god, of, covenant, agreement, treaty, alliance, promise, mitra, is, considered, a, being, worthy, of, worship, and, is, characterized, by, riches, the, yazata, avestan, are, divine, beings, worshiped, by, song, and, sacrifice, in, zoroastrianism, in, accordance, with, the, avesta, the, word, yazata, is, derived, from, yazdan, the, old, persian, word, for, god, and, literally, means, divinity, worthy, of, worship, or, veneration, as, a, concept, it, also, contains, a, wide, range, of, other, meanings, though, generally, signifying, or, used, as, an, epithet, of, a, divinity, the, origins, of, yazata, are, varied, with, many, also, being, featured, as, gods, in, hinduism, or, other, iranian, religions, in, modern, zoroastrianism, the, yazata, are, considered, holy, emanations, of, the, creator, always, devoted, to, him, and, obey, the, will, of, ahura, mazda, while, subject, to, repression, by, the, islamic, caliphate, the, yazata, were, often, framed, as, angels, to, counter, accusation, of, polytheism, shirk, according, to, the, avesta, the, yazata, assist, ahura, mazda, in, his, battle, against, the, evil, spirit, and, are, hypostases, of, moral, or, physical, aspects, of, creation, the, yazatas, collectively, are, the, good, powers, under, ahura, mazda, who, is, the, greatest, of, the, yazatas, yazatas, are, further, divided, into, amesha, spentas, their, ham, kar, or, collaborators, who, are, lower, ranking, divinities, and, also, certain, healing, plants, primordial, creatures, the, fravashis, of, the, dead, and, certain, prayers, that, are, themselves, considered, holy, the, amesha, spentas, and, their, ham, kar, or, collaborator, yazatas, are, as, follows, in, zoroastrianism, ahura, mazda, is, the, beginning, and, the, end, the, creator, of, everything, that, can, and, cannot, be, seen, the, eternal, and, uncreated, the, all, good, and, source, of, asha, in, the, gathas, the, most, sacred, texts, of, zoroastrianism, thought, to, have, been, composed, by, zoroaster, himself, zoroaster, acknowledged, the, highest, devotion, to, ahura, mazda, with, worship, and, adoration, also, given, to, ahura, mazda, s, manifestations, amesha, spenta, and, the, other, ahuras, yazata, that, support, ahura, mazda, daena, din, in, modern, persian, and, meaning, that, which, is, seen, is, representative, of, the, sum, of, one, s, spiritual, conscience, and, attributes, which, through, one, s, choice, asha, is, either, strengthened, or, weakened, in, the, daena, traditionally, the, manthras, similar, to, the, hindu, sacred, utterance, mantra, prayer, formulas, are, believed, to, be, of, immense, power, and, the, vehicles, of, asha, and, creation, used, to, maintain, good, and, fight, evil, daena, should, not, be, confused, with, the, fundamental, principle, of, asha, believed, to, be, the, cosmic, order, which, governs, and, permeates, all, existence, and, the, concept, of, which, governed, the, life, of, the, ancient, indo, iranians, for, these, asha, was, the, course, of, everything, observable, the, motion, of, the, planets, and, astral, bodies, the, progression, of, the, seasons, and, the, pattern, of, daily, nomadic, herdsman, life, governed, by, regular, metronomic, events, such, as, sunrise, and, sunset, and, was, strengthened, through, truth, telling, and, following, the, threefold, path, all, physical, creation, getig, was, thus, determined, to, run, according, to, a, master, plan, inherent, to, ahura, mazda, and, violations, of, the, order, druj, were, violations, against, creation, and, thus, violations, against, ahura, mazda, this, concept, of, asha, versus, the, druj, should, not, be, confused, with, western, and, especially, christian, notions, of, good, versus, evil, for, although, both, forms, of, opposition, express, moral, conflict, the, asha, versus, druj, concept, is, more, systemic, and, less, personal, representing, for, instance, chaos, that, opposes, order, or, uncreation, evident, as, natural, decay, that, opposes, creation, or, more, simply, the, lie, that, opposes, truth, and, goodness, moreover, in, the, role, as, the, one, uncreated, creator, of, all, ahura, mazda, is, not, the, creator, of, druj, which, is, nothing, anti, creation, and, thus, likewise, uncreated, and, developed, as, the, antithesis, of, existence, through, choice, in, this, schema, of, asha, versus, druj, mortal, beings, both, humans, and, animals, play, a, critical, role, for, they, too, are, created, here, in, their, lives, they, are, active, participants, in, the, conflict, and, it, is, their, spiritual, duty, to, defend, asha, which, is, under, constant, assault, and, would, decay, in, strength, without, counter, action, throughout, the, gathas, zoroaster, emphasizes, deeds, and, actions, within, society, and, accordingly, extreme, asceticism, is, frowned, upon, in, zoroastrianism, but, moderate, forms, are, allowed, within, humata, huxta, huvarshta, good, thoughts, good, words, good, deeds, the, threefold, path, of, asha, is, considered, the, core, maxim, of, zoroastrianism, especially, by, modern, practitioners, in, zoroastrianism, good, transpires, for, those, who, do, righteous, deeds, for, its, own, sake, not, for, the, search, of, reward, those, who, do, evil, are, said, to, be, attacked, and, confused, by, the, druj, and, are, responsible, for, aligning, themselves, back, to, asha, by, following, this, path, there, is, also, a, heavy, emphasis, on, spreading, happiness, mostly, through, charity, and, respecting, the, spiritual, equality, and, duty, of, both, men, and, women, central, to, zoroastrianism, is, the, emphasis, on, moral, choice, to, choose, the, responsibility, and, duty, for, which, one, is, in, the, mortal, world, or, to, give, up, this, duty, and, so, facilitate, the, work, of, druj, similarly, predestination, is, rejected, in, zoroastrian, teaching, and, the, absolute, free, will, of, all, conscious, beings, is, core, with, even, divine, beings, having, the, ability, to, choose, humans, bear, responsibility, for, all, situations, they, are, in, and, in, the, way, they, act, toward, one, another, reward, punishment, happiness, and, grief, all, depend, on, how, individuals, live, their, lives, in, zoroastrian, tradition, life, is, a, temporary, state, in, which, a, mortal, is, expected, to, participate, actively, in, the, continuing, battle, between, asha, and, druj, prior, to, its, incarnation, at, the, birth, of, the, child, the, urvan, soul, of, an, individual, is, still, united, with, its, fravashi, personal, higher, spirit, which, has, existed, since, ahura, mazda, created, the, universe, prior, to, the, splitting, off, of, the, urvan, the, fravashi, participates, in, the, maintenance, of, creation, led, by, ahura, mazda, during, the, life, of, a, given, individual, the, fravashi, acts, as, a, source, of, inspiration, to, perform, good, actions, and, as, a, spiritual, protector, the, fravashis, of, ancestors, cultural, spiritual, and, heroic, associated, with, illustrious, bloodlines, are, venerated, and, can, be, called, upon, to, aid, the, living, the, religion, states, that, active, and, ethical, participation, in, life, through, good, deeds, formed, from, good, thoughts, and, good, words, is, necessary, to, ensure, happiness, and, to, keep, chaos, at, bay, this, active, participation, is, a, central, element, in, zoroaster, s, concept, of, free, will, and, zoroastrianism, as, such, rejects, extreme, forms, of, asceticism, and, monasticism, but, historically, has, allowed, for, moderate, expressions, of, these, concepts, on, the, fourth, day, after, death, the, urvan, is, reunited, with, its, fravashi, whereupon, the, experiences, of, life, in, the, material, world, are, collected, for, use, in, the, continuing, battle, for, good, in, the, spiritual, world, for, the, most, part, zoroastrianism, does, not, have, a, notion, of, reincarnation, albeit, followers, of, ilm, e, kshnoom, in, india, among, other, currently, non, traditional, opinions, believe, in, reincarnation, and, practice, vegetarianism, zoroastrianism, s, emphasis, on, the, protection, and, veneration, of, nature, and, its, elements, has, led, some, to, proclaim, it, as, the, world, s, first, proponent, of, ecology, the, avesta, and, other, texts, call, for, the, protection, of, water, earth, fire, and, air, making, it, in, effect, an, ecological, religion, it, is, not, surprising, that, mazdaism, is, called, the, first, ecological, religion, the, reverence, for, yazatas, divine, spirits, emphasizes, the, preservation, of, nature, avesta, yasnas, 1, 19, 3, 4, 16, 9, yashts, 6, 3, 4, 10, 13, however, this, particular, assertion, is, limited, to, natural, forces, held, as, emanations, of, asha, by, the, fact, that, early, zoroastrians, had, a, duty, to, exterminate, evil, species, a, dictate, no, longer, followed, in, modern, zoroastrianism, although, there, have, been, various, theological, statements, supporting, vegetarianism, in, zoroastrianism, s, history, and, those, who, believe, that, zoroaster, was, vegetarian, zoroastrianism, is, not, entirely, uniform, in, theological, and, philosophical, thought, especially, with, historical, and, modern, influences, having, a, significant, impact, on, individual, and, local, beliefs, practices, values, and, vocabulary, sometimes, merging, with, tradition, and, in, other, cases, displacing, it, the, ultimate, purpose, in, the, life, of, a, practicing, zoroastrian, is, to, become, an, ashavan, a, master, of, asha, and, to, bring, happiness, into, the, world, which, contributes, to, the, cosmic, battle, against, evil, the, core, teachings, of, zoroastrianism, include, according, to, the, zoroastrian, creation, myth, there, is, one, universal, transcendent, all, good, and, uncreated, supreme, creator, deity, ahura, mazda, or, the, wise, lord, ahura, meaning, lord, and, mazda, meaning, wisdom, in, avestan, zoroaster, keeps, the, two, attributes, separate, as, two, different, concepts, in, most, of, the, gathas, yet, sometimes, combines, them, into, one, form, zoroaster, also, proclaims, that, ahura, mazda, is, omniscient, but, not, omnipotent, ahura, mazda, existed, in, light, and, goodness, above, while, angra, mainyu, also, referred, to, in, later, texts, as, ahriman, the, destructive, spirit, mentality, existed, in, darkness, and, ignorance, below, they, have, existed, independently, of, each, other, for, all, time, and, manifest, contrary, substances, in, the, gathas, ahura, mazda, is, noted, as, working, through, emanations, known, as, the, amesha, spenta, and, with, the, help, of, other, ahuras, these, divine, beings, called, amesha, spentas, support, him, and, are, representative, and, guardians, of, different, aspects, of, creation, and, the, ideal, personality, ahura, mazda, is, immanent, in, humankind, and, interacts, with, creation, through, these, bounteous, holy, divinities, in, addition, to, these, he, is, assisted, by, a, league, of, countless, divinities, called, yazatas, meaning, worthy, of, worship, each, yazata, is, generally, a, hypostasis, of, a, moral, or, physical, aspect, of, creation, asha, is, the, main, spiritual, force, which, comes, from, ahura, mazda, it, is, the, cosmic, order, and, is, the, antithesis, of, chaos, which, is, evident, as, druj, falsehood, and, disorder, that, comes, from, angra, mainyu, the, resulting, cosmic, conflict, involves, all, of, creation, mental, spiritual, and, material, including, humanity, at, its, core, which, has, an, active, role, to, play, in, the, conflict, the, main, representative, of, asha, in, this, conflict, is, spenta, mainyu, the, creative, spirit, mentality, ahura, mazda, then, created, the, material, and, visible, world, itself, in, order, to, ensnare, evil, he, created, the, floating, egg, shaped, universe, in, two, parts, first, the, spiritual, menog, and, 3, 000, years, later, the, physical, getig, ahura, mazda, then, created, gayomard, the, archetypical, perfect, man, and, gavaevodata, the, primordial, bovine, while, ahura, mazda, created, the, universe, and, humankind, angra, mainyu, whose, very, nature, is, to, destroy, miscreated, demons, evil, daevas, and, noxious, creatures, khrafstar, such, as, snakes, ants, and, flies, angra, mainyu, created, an, opposite, evil, being, for, each, good, being, except, for, humans, which, he, found, he, could, not, match, angra, mainyu, invaded, the, universe, through, the, base, of, the, sky, inflicting, gayomard, and, the, bull, with, suffering, and, death, however, the, evil, forces, were, trapped, in, the, universe, and, could, not, retreat, the, dying, primordial, man, and, bovine, emitted, seeds, which, were, protect, by, mah, the, moon, from, the, bull, s, seed, grew, all, beneficial, plants, and, animals, of, the, world, and, from, the, man, s, seed, grew, a, plant, whose, leaves, became, the, first, human, couple, humans, thus, struggle, in, a, two, fold, universe, of, the, material, and, spiritual, trapped, and, in, long, combat, with, evil, the, evils, of, this, physical, world, are, not, products, of, an, inherent, weakness, but, are, the, fault, of, angra, mainyu, s, assault, on, creation, this, assault, turned, the, perfectly, flat, peaceful, and, daily, illuminated, world, into, a, mountainous, violent, place, that, is, half, night, according, to, zoroastrian, cosmology, in, articulating, the, ahuna, vairya, formula, ahura, mazda, made, the, ultimate, triumph, of, good, against, angra, mainyu, evident, ahura, mazda, will, ultimately, prevail, over, the, evil, angra, mainyu, at, which, point, reality, will, undergo, a, cosmic, renovation, called, frashokereti, and, limited, time,

of, the, avesta, dating, at, oldest, from, the, times, of, the, sasanian, empire, the, avesta, was, composed, at, different, times, providing, a, series, of, snapshots, of, the, religion, that, allow,

vishtaspa, here, two, copies, were, created, one, which, was, put, in, the, house, of, archives, and, the, other, put, in, the, imperial, treasury, during, alexander, s, conquest, of, persia, the, avesta, written, on, 1200, ox, hides, was, burned, and, the, scientific, sections, that, the, greeks, could, use, were, dispersed, among, themselves, however, there, is, no, strong, historical, evidence, for, this, and, they, remain, contested, despite, affirmations, from, the, zoroastrian, tradition, whether, it, be, the, denkart, tansar, n, ma, ard, y, wir, z, n, mag, bundahsin, zand, i,

its, orthodox, character, while, under, khosrow, i, the, avesta, was, translated, into, pahlavi, the, compilation, of, the, avesta, can, be, authoritatively, traced, however, to, the, sasanian, empire, of, which, only, fraction, survive, today, if, the, middle, persian, literature, is, correct, the, later, manuscripts, all, date, from, after, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, the,

vary, wildly, from, 2000, bce, to, 200, years, before, alexander, zoroaster, was, born, in, either, northeast, iran, or, southwest, afghanistan, into, a, culture, with, a, polytheistic, religion, which, featured, excessive, animal, sacrifice, and, the, excessive, ritual, use, of, intoxicants, his, life, was, influenced, profoundly, by, the, attempts, of, his, people, to, find, peace, and, stability, in, the, face, of, constant, threats, of, raiding, and, conflict, zoroaster, s, birth, and, early, life, are, little, documented, but, speculated, upon, heavily, in, later, texts, what, is, known, is, recorded, in, the, gathas, forming, the, core, of, the, avesta, which, contain, hymns, thought, to, have, been, composed, by, zoroaster, himself, born, into, the, spitama, clan, he, refers, to, himself, as, a, poet, priest, and, prophet, he, had, a, wife, three, sons, and, three, daughters, the, numbers, of, which, are, gathered, from, various, texts, zoroaster, rejected, many, of, the, gods, of, the, bronze, age, iranians, and, their, oppressive, class, structure, in, which, the, kavis, and, karapans, princes, and, priests, controlled, the, ordinary, people, he, also, opposed, cruel, animal, sacrifices, and, the, excessive, use, of, the, possibly, hallucinogenic, haoma, plant, conjectured, to, have, been, a, species, of, ephedra, or, peganum, harmala, but, did, not, condemn, either, practice, outright, providing, moderation, was, observed, according, to, later, zoroastrian, tradition, when, zoroaster, was, 30, years, old, he, went, into, the, daiti, river, to, draw, water, for, a, haoma, ceremony, when, he, emerged, he, received, a, vision, of, vohu, manah, after, this, vohu, manah, took, him, to, the, other, six, amesha, spentas, where, he, received, the, completion, of, his, vision, this, vision, radically, transformed, his, view, of, the, world, and, he, tried, to, teach, this, view, to, others, zoroaster, believed, in, one, supreme, creator, deity,

quickly, he, originally, only, had, one, convert, his, cousin, maidhyoimanha, the, cypress, of, kashmar, is, a, mythical, cypress, tree, of, legendary, beauty, and, gargantuan, dimensions, it, is, said, to, have, sprung, from, a, branch, brought, by, zoroaster, from, paradise, and, to, have, stood, in, today, s, kashmar, in, northeastern, iran, and, to, have, been, planted, by, zoroaster, in, honor, of, the, conversion, of, king, vishtaspa, to, zoroastrianism, according, to, the, iranian, physicist, and, historian, zakariya, al, qazwini, king, vishtaspa, had, been, a, patron, of, zoroaster, who, planted, the, tree, himself, in, his, aj, ib, al, makhl, q, t, wa, ghar, ib, al, mawj, d, t, he, further, describes, how, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mutawakkil, in, 247, ah, 861, ce, caused, the, mighty, cypress, to, be, felled, and, then, transported, it, across, iran, to, be, used, for, beams, in, his, new, palace, at, samarra, before, he, wanted, the, tree, to, be, reconstructed, before, his, eyes, this, was, done, in, spite, of, protests, by, the, iranians, who, offered, a, very, great, sum, of, money, to, save, the, tree, al, mutawakkil, never, saw, the, cypress, because, he, was, murdered, by, a, turkish, soldier, possibly, in, the, employ, of, his, son, on, the, night, when, it, arrived, on, the, banks, of, the, tigris, kashmar, fire, temple, was, the, first, zoroastrian, fire, temple, built, by, vishtaspa, at, the, request, of, zoroaster, in, kashmar, in, a, part, of, ferdowsi, s, shahnameh, the, story, of, finding, zarathustra, and, accepting, vishtaspa, s, religion, is, regulated, that, after, accepting, zoroastrian, religion, vishtaspa, sends, priests, all, over, the, universe, and, azar, enters, the, fire, temples, domes, and, the, first, of, them, is, adur, burzen, mihr, who, founded, in, kashmar, and, planted, a, cypress, tree, in, front, of, the, fire, temple, and, made, it, a, symbol, of, accepting, the, bahi, religion, and, he, sent, priests, all, over, the, world, and, commanded, all, the, famous, men, and, women, to, come, to, that, place, of, worship, according, to, the, paikuli, inscription, during, the,

of, kashmar, in, the, castle, complex, of, atashgah, the, roots, of, zoroastrianism, are, thought, to, lie, in, a, common, prehistoric, indo, iranian, religious, system, dating, back, to, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, the, prophet, zoroaster, himself, though, traditionally, dated, to, the, 6th, century, bce, is, thought, by, many, modern, historians, to, have, been, a, reformer, of, the,

scholars, as, a, candidate, zoroastrianism, as, a, religion, was, not, firmly, established, until, centuries, later, during, the, young, avestan, period, at, this, time, the, zoroastrian, community, was, concentrated, in, the, eastern, portion, of, greater, iran, although, no, consensus, exists, on, the, chronology, of, the, avestan, period, the, lack, of, any, discernable, persian, and, median,

herodotus, the, magi, were, the, sixth, tribe, of, the, medes, until, the, unification, of, the, persian, empire, under, cyrus, the, great, all, iranians, were, referred, to, as, mede, or, mada, by, the, peoples, of, the, ancient, world, and, wielded, considerable, influence, at, the, courts, of, the, median, emperors, following, the, unification, of, the, median, and, persian, empires, in, 550,

inscription, and, appear, to, have, continued, the, model, of, coexistence, with, other, religions, whether, darius, was, a, follower, of, the, teachings, of, zoroaster, has, not, been, conclusively, established, as, there, is, no, indication, of, note, that, worship, of, ahura, mazda, was, exclusively, a, zoroastrian, practice, according, to, later, zoroastrian, legend, denkard, and, the, book,

zoroastrianism, often, building, fire, temples, in, captured, territories, to, promote, the, religion, during, the, period, of, their, centuries, long, suzerainty, over, the, caucasus, the, sassanids,

it, was, still, widely, practised, as, something, like, a, second, established, religion, over, the, course, of, 16, years, during, the, 7th, century, most, of, the, sasanian, empire, was, conquered, by, the, emerging, muslim, caliphate, although, the, administration, of, the, state, was, rapidly, islamicized, and, subsumed, under, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, the, beginning, there, was, little, serious, pressure, exerted, on, newly, subjected, people, to, adopt, islam, because, of, their, sheer, numbers, the, conquered, zoroastrians, had, to, be, treated, as, dhimmis, despite, doubts, of, the, validity, of, this, identification, that, persisted, down, the, centuries, which, made, them, eligible, for, protection, islamic, jurists, took, the, stance, that, only, muslims, could, be, perfectly, moral, but, unbelievers, might, as, well, be, left, to, their, iniquities, so, long, as, these, did, not, vex, their, overlords, in, the, main, once, the, conquest, was, over, and, local, terms, were, agreed, on, the, arab, governors, protected, the, local, populations, in, exchange, for, tribute, the, arabs, adopted, the, sasanian, tax, system, both, the, land, tax, levied, on, landowners, and, the, poll, tax, levied, on, individuals, called, jizya, a, tax, levied, on, non, muslims, i, e, the, dhimmis, in, time, this, poll, tax, came, to, be, used, as, a, means, to, humble, the, non, muslims, and, a, number, of, laws, and, restrictions, evolved, to, emphasize, their, inferior, status, under, the, early, orthodox, caliphs, as, long, as, the, non, muslims, paid, their, taxes, and, adhered, to, the, dhimmi, laws, administrators, were, enjoined, to, leave, non, muslims, in, their, religion, and, their, land, under, abbasid, rule, muslim, iranians, who, by, then, were, in, the, majority, in, many, instances, showed, severe, disregard, for, and, mistreated, local, zoroastrians, for, example, in, the, 9th, century, a, deeply, venerated, cypress, tree, in, khorasan, which, parthian, era, legend, supposed, had, been, planted, by, zoroaster, himself, was, felled, for, the, construction, of, a, palace, in, baghdad, 2, 000, miles, 3, 200, km, away, in, the, 10th, century, on, the, day, that, a, tower, of, silence, had, been, completed, at, much, trouble, and, expense, a, muslim, official, contrived, to, get, up, onto, it, and, to, call, the, adhan, the, muslim, call, to, prayer, from, its, walls, this, was, turned, into, a, pretext, to, annex, the, building, ultimately, muslim, scholars, like, al, biruni, found, few, records, left, of, the, belief, of, for, instance, the, khawarizmians, because, figures, like, qutayba, ibn, muslim, extinguished, and, ruined, in, every, possible, way, all, those, who, knew, how, to, write, and, read, the, khawarizmi, writing, who, knew, the, history, of, the, country, and, who, studied, their, sciences, as, a, result, these, things, are, involved, in, so, much, obscurity, that, it, is, impossible, to, obtain, an, accurate, knowledge, of, the, history, of, the, country, since, the, time, of, islam, though, subject, to, a, new, leadership, and, harassment, the, zoroastrians, were, able, to, continue, their, former, ways, although, there, was, a, slow, but, steady, social, and, economic, pressure, to, convert, with, the, nobility, and, city, dwellers, being, the, first, to, do, so, while, islam, was, accepted, more, slowly, among, the, peasantry, and, landed, gentry, power, and, worldly, advantage, now, lay, with, followers, of, islam, and, although, the, official, policy, was, one, of, aloof, contempt, there, were, individual, muslims, eager, to, proselytize, and, ready, to, use, all, sorts, of, means, to, do, so, in, time, a, tradition, evolved, by, which, islam, was, made, to, appear, as, a, partly, iranian, religion, one, example, of, this, was, a, legend, that, husayn, son, of, the, fourth, caliph, ali, and, grandson, of, islam, s, prophet, muhammad, had, married, a, captive, sassanid, princess, named, shahrbanu, this, wholly, fictitious, figure, was, said, to, have, borne, husayn, a, son, the, historical, fourth, shi, a, imam, who, insisted, that, the, caliphate, rightly, belonged, to, him, and, his, descendants, and, that, the, umayyads, had, wrongfully, wrested, it, from, him, the, alleged, descent, from, the, sassanid, house, counterbalanced, the, arab, nationalism, of, the, umayyads, and, the, iranian, national, association, with, a, zoroastrian, past, was, disarmed, thus, according, to, scholar, mary, boyce, it, was, no, longer, the, zoroastrians, alone, who, stood, for, patriotism, and, loyalty, to, the, past, the, damning, indictment, that, becoming, muslim, was, un, iranian, only, remained, an, idiom, in, zoroastrian, texts, with, iranian, support, the, abbasids, overthrew, the, umayyads, in, 750, and, in, the, subsequent, caliphate, government, that, nominally, lasted, until, 1258, muslim, iranians, received, marked, favor, in, the, new, government, both, in, iran, and, at, the, capital, in, baghdad, this, mitigated, the, antagonism, between, arabs, and, iranians, but, sharpened, the, distinction, between, muslims, and, non, muslims, the, abbasids, zealously, persecuted, heretics, and, although, this, was, directed, mainly, at, muslim, sectarians, it, also, created, a, harsher, climate, for, non, muslims, despite, economic, and, social, incentives, to, convert, zoroastrianism, remained, strong, in, some, regions, particularly, in, those, furthest, away, from, the, caliphate, capital, at, baghdad, in, bukhara, present, day, uzbekistan, resistance, to, islam, required, the, 9th, century, arab, commander, qutaiba, to, convert, his, province, four, times, the, first, three, times, the, citizens, reverted, to, their, old, religion, finally, the, governor, made, their, religion, difficult, for, them, in, every, way, turned, the, local, fire, temple, into, a, mosque, and, encouraged, the, local, population, to, attend, friday, prayers, by, paying, each, attendee, two, dirhams, the, cities, where, arab, governors, resided, were, particularly, vulnerable, to, such, pressures, and, in, these, cases, the, zoroastrians, were, left, with, no, choice, but, to, either, conform, or, migrate, to, regions, that, had, a, more, amicable, administration, the, 9th, century, came, to, define, the, great, number, of, zoroastrian, texts, that, were, composed, or, re, written, during, the, 8th, to, 10th, centuries, excluding, copying, and, lesser, amendments, which, continued, for, some, time, thereafter, all, of, these, works, are, in, the, middle, persian, dialect, of, that, period, free, of, arabic, words, and, written, in, the, difficult, pahlavi, script, hence, the, adoption, of, the, term, pahlavi, as, the, name, of, the, variant, of, the, language, and, of, the, genre, of, those, zoroastrian, books, if, read, aloud, these, books, would, still, have, been, intelligible, to, the, laity, many, of, these, texts, are, responses, to, the, tribulations, of, the, time, and, all, of, them, include, exhortations, to, stand, fast, in, their, religious, beliefs, in, khorasan, in, northeastern, iran, a, 10th, century, iranian, nobleman, brought, together, four, zoroastrian, priests, to, transcribe, a, sassanid, era, middle, persian, work, titled, book, of, the, lord, khwaday, namag, from, pahlavi, script, into, arabic, script, this, transcription, which, remained, in, middle, persian, prose, an, arabic, version, by, al, muqaffa, also, exists, was, completed, in, 957, and, subsequently, became, the, basis, for, firdausi, s, book, of, kings, it, became, enormously, popular, among, both, zoroastrians, and, muslims, and, also, served, to, propagate, the, sassanid, justification, for, overthrowing, the, arsacids, among, migrations, were, those, to, cities, in, or, on, the, margins, of, the, great, salt, deserts, in, particular, to, yazd, and, kerman, which, remain, centers, of, iranian, zoroastrianism, to, this, day, yazd, became, the, seat, of, the, iranian, high, priests, during, mongol, ilkhanate, rule, when, the, best, hope, for, survival, was, to, be, inconspicuous, crucial, to, the, present, day, survival, of, zoroastrianism, was, a, migration, from, the, northeastern, iranian, town, of, sanjan, in, south, western, khorasan, to, gujarat, in, western, india, the, descendants, of, that, group, are, today, known, as, the, parsis, as, the, gujaratis, from, long, tradition, called, anyone, from, iran, who, today, represent, the, larger, of, the, two, groups, of, zoroastrians, in, india, the, struggle, between, zoroastrianism, and, islam, declined, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, local, iranian, dynasties, all, vigorously, muslim, had, emerged, as, largely, independent, vassals, of, the, caliphs, in, the, 16th, century, in, one, of, the, early, letters, between, iranian, zoroastrians, and, their, co, religionists, in, india, the, priests, of, yazd, lamented, that, no, period, not, even, that, of, alexander, had, been, more, grievous, or, troublesome, for, the, faithful, than, this, millennium, of, the, demon, of, wrath, zoroastrianism, has, survived, into, the, modern, period, particularly, in, india, where, the, parsis, are, thought, to, have, been, present, since, about, the, 9th, century, today, zoroastrianism, can, be, divided, in, two, main, schools, of, thought, reformists, and, traditionalists, traditionalists, are, mostly, parsis, and, accept, beside, the, gathas, and, avesta, also, the, middle, persian, literature, and, like, the, reformists, mostly, developed, in, their, modern, form, from, 19th, century, developments, they, generally, do, not, allow, conversion, to, the, faith, and, as, such, for, someone, to, be, a, zoroastrian, they, must, be, born, of, zoroastrian, parents, some, traditionalists, recognize, the, children, of, mixed, marriages, as, zoroastrians, though, usually, only, if, the, father, is, a, born, zoroastrian, not, all, zoroastrians, identify, with, either, school, and, notable, examples, are, getting, traction, including, neo, zoroastrians, revivalists, which, are, usually, reinterpretations, of, zoroastrianism, appealing, towards, western, concerns, and, centering, the, idea, of, zoroastrianism, as, a, living, religion, and, advocate, the, revival, and, maintenance, of, old, rituals, and, prayers, while, supporting, ethical, and, social, progressive, reforms, both, of, these, latter, schools, tend, to, center, the, gathas, without, outright, rejecting, other, texts, except, the, vendidad, from, the, 19th, century, onward, the, parsis, gained, a, reputation, for, their, education, and, widespread, influence, in, all, aspects, of, society, they, played, an, instrumental, role, in, the, economic, development, of, the, region, over, many, decades, several, of, the, best, known, business, conglomerates, of, india, are, run, by, parsi, zoroastrians, including, the, tata, godrej, wadia, families, and, others, for, a, variety, of, social, and, political, factors, the, zoroastrians, of, the, indian, subcontinent, namely, the, parsis, and, iranis, have, not, engaged, in, conversion, since, at, least, the, 18th, century, zoroastrian, high, priests, have, historically, opined, there, is, no, reason, to, not, allow, conversion, which, is, also, supported, by, the, revayats, and, other, scripture, though, later, priests, have, condemned, these, judgements, within, iran, many, of, the, beleaguered, zoroastrians, have, been, also, historically, opposed, or, not, practically, concerned, with, the, matter, of, conversion, currently, though, the, council, of, tehran, mobeds, the, highest, ecclesiastical, authority, within, iran, endorses, conversion, but, conversion, from, islam, to, zoroastrianism, is, illegal, under, the, laws, of, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, though, the, armenians, share, a, rich, history, affiliated, with, zoroastrianism, that, eventually, declined, with, the, advent, of, christianity, reports, indicate, that, there, were, zoroastrians, in, armenia, until, the, 1920s, at, the, request, of, the, government, of, tajikistan, unesco, declared, 2003, a, year, to, celebrate, the, 3000th, anniversary, of, zoroastrian, culture, with, special, events, throughout, the, world, in, 2011, the, tehran, mobeds, anjuman, announced, that, for, the, first, time, in, the, history, of, modern, iran, and, of, the, modern, zoroastrian, communities, worldwide, women, had, been, ordained, in, iran, and, north, america, as, mobedyars, meaning, women, assistant, mobeds, zoroastrian, clergy, the, women, hold, official, certificates, and, can, perform, the, lower, rung, religious, functions, and, can, initiate, people, into, the, religion, the, current, zoroastrian, population, is, said, be, around, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, and, reportedly, declining, however, further, studies, are, needed, to, confirm, this, as, numbers, have, also, been, rising, in, some, areas, such, as, iran, zoroastrian, communities, internationally, tend, to, comprise, mostly, two, main, groups, of, people, indian, parsis, and, iranian, zoroastrians, according, to, a, study, in, 2012, by, the, federation, of, zoroastrian, associations, of, north, america, the, number, of, zoroastrians, worldwide, was, estimated, to, be, between, 111, 691, and, 121, 962, the, number, is, imprecise, because, of, diverging, counts, in, iran, iran, s, figures, of, zoroastrians, have, ranged, widely, the, last, census, 1974, before, the, revolution, of, 1979, revealed, 21, 400, zoroastrians, some, 10, 000, adherents, remain, in, the, central, asian, regions, that, were, once, considered, the, traditional, stronghold, of, zoroastrianism, i, e, bactria, see, also, balkh, which, is, in, northern, afghanistan, sogdiana, margiana, and, other, areas, close, to, zoroaster, s, homeland, in, iran, emigration, out, marriage, and, low, birth, rates, are, likewise, leading, to, a, decline, in, the, zoroastrian, population, zoroastrian, groups, in, iran, say, their, number, is, approximately, 60, 000, according, to, the, iranian, census, data, from, 2011, the, number, of, zoroastrians, in, iran, was, 25, 271, communities, exist, in, tehran, as, well, as, in, yazd, kerman, and, kermanshah, where, many, still, speak, an, iranian, language, distinct, from, the, usual, persian, they, call, their, language, dari, not, to, be, confused, with, the, dari, spoken, in, afghanistan, their, language, is, also, called, gavri, or, behdini, literally, of, the, good, religion, sometimes, their, language, is, named, for, the, cities, in, which, it, is, spoken, such, as, yazdi, or, kermani, iranian, zoroastrians, were, historically, called, gabr, s, the, number, of, kurdish, zoroastrians, along, with, those, of, non, ethnic, converts, has, been, estimated, differently, the, zoroastrian, representative, of, the, kurdistan, regional, government, in, iraq, has, reported, that, as, many, as, 100, 000, people, in, iraqi, kurdistan, have, converted, to, zoroastrianism, recently, with, some, community, leaders, speculating, that, even, more, zoroastrians, in, the, region, are, practicing, their, faith, secretly, however, this, has, not, been, confirmed, by, independent, sources, the, surge, in, kurdish, muslims, converting, to, zoroastrianism, is, largely, attributed, to, disillusionment, with, islam, after, experiencing, violence, and, oppression, perpetrated, by, isis, in, the, area, india, is, considered, to, be, home, to, a, large, zoroastrian, population, the, descendants, of, migrants, from, iran, and, today, known, as, the, parsis, in, india, s, 2001, census, the, parsi, population,

zoroastrians, use, in, england, so, that, he, can, work, with, communities, to, enhance, and, protect, those, buildings, now, and, in, the, future, the, scoping, survey, identified, four, buildings, in, england, the, religion, of, zoroastrianism, is, closest, to, historical, vedic, religion, to, varying, degrees, some, historians, believe, that, zoroastrianism, along, with, similar, philosophical, revolutions, in, south, asia, were, interconnected, strings, of, reformation, against, a, common, indo, aryan, thread, many, traits, of, zoroastrianism, can, be, traced, back, to, the, culture, and, beliefs, of, the, prehistorical, indo, iranian, period, that, is, to, the, time, before, the, migrations, that, led, to, the, indo, aryans, and, iranics, becoming, distinct, peoples, zoroastrianism, consequently, shares, elements, with, the, historical, vedic, religion, that, also, has, its, origins, in, that, era, some, examples, include, cognates, between, the, avestan, word, ahura, ahura, mazda, and, the, vedic, sanskrit, word, asura, demon, evil, demigod, as, well, as, daeva, demon, and, deva, god, and, they, both, descend, from, a, common, proto, indo, iranian, religion, zoroastrianism, itself, inherited, ideas, from, other, belief, systems, and, like, other, practiced, religions, accommodates, some, degree, of, syncretism, with, zoroastrianism, in, sogdia, the, kushan, empire, armenia, china, and, other, places, incorporating, local, and, foreign, practices, and, deities, zoroastrian, influences, on, hungarian, slavic, ossetian, turkic, and, mongol, mythologies, have, also, been, noted, all, of, which, bearing, extensive, light, dark, dualisms, and, possible, sun, god, theonyms, related, to, hvare, khshaeta, zoroastrianism, is, sometimes, credited, with, being, the, first, monotheistic, religion, in, history, antedating, the, israelites, and, leaving, a, lasting, and, profound, imprint, on, second, temple, judaism, and, through, it, on, later, monotheistic, religions, such, as, early, christianity, and, islam, there, are, clear, commonalities, and, similarities, between, zoroastrianism, judaism, and, christianity, such, as, monotheism, dualism, i, e, a, robust, notion, of, a, devil, but, with, a, positive, appraisal, of, material, creation, symbolism, of, the, divine, heaven, s, and, hell, s, angels, and, demons, eschatology, and, final, judgment, a, messianic, figure, and, the, idea, of, a, savior, a, holy, spirit, concern, with, ritual, purity, an, idealization, of, wisdom, and, righteousness, and, other, doctrines, symbols, practices, and, religious, features, according, to, mary, boyce, zoroaster, was, thus, the, first, to, teach, the, doctrines, of, an, individual, judgement, heaven, and, hell, the, future, resurrection, of, the, body, the, general, last, judgement, and, life, everlasting, for, the, reunited, soul, and, body, these, doctrines, were, to, become, familiar, articles, of, faith, to, much, of, mankind, through, borrowing, by, judaism, christianity, and, islam, yet, it, is, in, zoroastrianism, itself, that, they, have, their, fullest, logical, coherence, since, zoroaster, insisted, both, on, the, goodness, of, material, creation, and, hence, of, the, physical, body, and, on, the, unwavering, impartiality, of, divine, justice, the, interactions, between, judaism, and, zoroastrianism, resulted, in, transfer, of, religious, ideas, between, the, two, religions, and, as, a, result, it, is, believed, that, jews, during, achaemenid, rule, were, influenced, by, zoroastrian, angelology, demonology, eschatology, as, well, as, zoroastrian, ideas, about, compensatory, justice, in, life, and, after, death, it, is, also, postulated, that, the, jewish, high, monotheistic, concept, of, god, developed, during, and, after, the, period, of, the, babylonian, captivity, when, the, jews, had, a, prolonged, exposure, to, sophisticated, zoroastrian, beliefs, in, addition, to, this, zoroastrian, dualistic, concepts, had, influenced, middle, eastern, religions, such, as, judeo, christian, beliefs, since, achaemenid, period, to, the, early, centuries, of, present, era, the, dualistic, ideas, of, jewish, eschatology, such, as, the, belief, in, savior, the, final, battle, between, good, and, evil, the, triumph, of, good, and, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, have, been, influenced, by, zoroastrian, beliefs, these, ideas, later, passed, on, to, christianity, from, zoroastrian, inspired, texts, of, the, old, testament, according, to, some, sources, such, as, the, jewish, encyclopedia, 1906, there, exist, many, similarities, between, zoroastrianism, and, judaism, this, has, led, some, to, propose, that, key, zoroastrian, concepts, influenced, judaism, however, other, scholars, disagree, finding, that, the, general, social, influence, of, zoroastrianism, was, much, more, limited, and, that, no, link, can, be, found, in, jewish, or, christian, texts, proponents, of, a, link, cite, similarities, between, the, two, such, as, dualism, good, and, evil, divine, twins, ahura, mazda, god, and, angra, mainyu, satan, image, of, the, deity, eschatology, resurrection, and, final, judgment, messianism, revelation, of, zoroaster, on, a, mountain, with, moses, on, mount, sinai, three, sons, of, fereydun, with, three, sons, of, noah, heaven, and, hell, angelology, and, demonology, cosmology, of, six, days, or, periods, of, creation, and, free, will, among, others, other, scholars, diminish, or, reject, such, influences, noting, that, zoroastrianism, has, a, unique, theistic, doctrine, which, combines, dualism, polytheism, and, pantheism, rather, than, being, a, monotheistic, religion, others, say, there, is, little, concrete, evidence, about, the, precise, origin, and, development, of, zoroastrianism, and, that, zoroastrianism, does, not, compare, with, the, jewish, belief, in, the, sovereignty, of, god, over, the, whole, of, creation, others, such, as, lester, l, grabbe, have, said, there, is, general, agreement, that, persian, religion, and, tradition, had, its, influence, on, judaism, over, the, centuries, and, the, question, is, where, this, influence, was, and, which, of, the, developments, in, judaism, can, be, ascribed, to, the, iranian, side, as, opposed, to, the, effect, of, the, greek, or, other, cultures, there, exist, distinctions, but, also, similarities, between, zoroastrian, and, jewish, law, regarding, marriage, and, procreation, while, mary, boyce, says, that, besides, abrahamic, religions, its, influence, also, extended, to, northern, buddhism, zoroastrians, are, considered, to, be, a, people, of, the, book, by, muslims, zoroastrianism, is, often, compared, with, manichaeism, nominally, an, iranian, religion, manichaeism, was, heavily, inspired, by, zoroastrianism, because, of, mani, s, iranian, origin, and, it, was, also, rooted, in, prior, middle, eastern, gnostic, beliefs, manichaeism, adopted, many, of, the, yazatas, for, its, own, pantheon, gherardo, gnoli, in, the, encyclopaedia, of, religion, says, that, we, can, assert, that, manichaeism, has, its, roots, in, the, iranian, religious, tradition, and, that, its, relationship, to, mazdaism, or, zoroastrianism, is, more, or, less, like, that, of, christianity, to, judaism, the, two, religions, have, substantial, differences, many, aspects, of, zoroastrianism, are, present, in, the, culture, and, mythologies, of, the, peoples, of, greater, iran, not, least, because, zoroastrianism, was, a, dominant, influence, on, the, people, of, the, cultural, continent, for, a, thousand, years, even, after, the, rise, of, islam, and, the, loss, of, direct, influence, zoroastrianism, remained, part, of, the, cultural, heritage, of, the, iranian, language, speaking, world, in, part, as, festivals, and, customs, but, also, because, ferdowsi, incorporated, a, number, of, the, figures, and, stories, from, the, avesta, in, his, epic, sh, hn, me, which, is, pivotal, to, iranian, identity, one, notable, example, is, the, incorporation, of, the, yazata, sraosha, as, an, angel, venerated, within, shia, islam, in, iran, it, is, noteworthy, that, mani, who, was, brought, up, and, spent, most, of, his, life, in, a, province, of, the, persian, empire, and, whose, mother, belonged, to, a, famous, parthian, family, did, not, make, any, use, of, the, iranian, mythological, tradition, there, can, no, longer, be, any, doubt, that, the, iranian, names, of, s, m, nar, m, n, etc, that, appear, in, the, persian, and, sogdian, versions, of, the, book, of, the, giants, did, not, figure, in, the, original, edition, written, by, mani, in, the, syriac, language
