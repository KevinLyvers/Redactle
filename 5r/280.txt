of, the, epic, mahabharata, the, bhagavad, gita, is, dated, to, the, second, half, of, the, first, millennium, bce, although, hinduism, includes, several, denominations, the, gita, holds, a, unique, pan, hindu, influence, as, the, most, prominent, sacred, text, it, has, been, said, that, if, there, is, any, one, text, that, comes, near, to, embodying, the, totality, of, hindu, thought, it, is, the, bhagavad, gita, the, bhagavad, gita, is, set, in, a, narrative, framework, of, dialogue, between, the, pandava, prince, arjuna, and, his, charioteer, guide, krishna, an, avatar, of, vishnu, at, the, start, of, the, kurukshetra, war, between, the, pandavas, and, the, kauravas, arjuna, despairs, thinking, about, the, violence, and, death, the, war, will, cause, in, the, battle, against, his, kin, and, becomes, emotionally, preoccupied, with, a, dilemma, wondering, if, he, should, renounce, the, war, arjuna, seeks, the, counsel, of, krishna, whose, answers, and, discourse, constitute, the, text, krishna, counsels, arjuna, to, fulfil, his, kshatriya, warrior, duty, for, the, upholding, of, dharma, the, krishna, arjuna, dialogue, covers, a, broad, range, of, spiritual, topics, touching, upon, moral, and, ethical, dilemmas, and, philosophical, issues, that, go, far, beyond, the, war, that, arjuna, faces, the, setting, of, the, text, in, a, battlefield, has, been, interpreted, as, an, allegory, for, the, struggles, and, vagaries, of, human, life, summarizing, the, upanishadic, conceptions, of, god, the, gita, posits, the, existence, of, an, individual, self, atman, and, the, supreme, self, brahman, within, each, being, the, dialogue, between, the, prince, and, his, charioteer, has, been, interpreted, as, a, metaphor, for, an, immortal, dialogue, between, the, human, self, and, god, commentators, of, vedanta, read, varying, notions, in, the, bhagavad, gita, about, the, relationship, between, the, atman, individual, self, and, brahman, supreme, self, advaita, vedanta, affirms, on, the, non, duality, of, atman, and, brahman, whereas, vishishtadvaita, asserts, qualified, non, dualism, with, atman, and, brahman, being, related, but, different, in, certain, aspects, while, dvaita, vedanta, declares, the, complete, duality, of, atman, and, brahman, as, per, traditional, accounts, of, hindu, mythology, the, gita, was, written, by, ganesha, as, told, to, him, by, the, sage, veda, vyasa, the, gita, forms, the, chapters, 23, 40, in, book, 6, of, the, mahabharata, called, the, bhishma, parva, and, forms, a, central, text, in, the, vaishnava, hindu, tradition, and, prasthanatrayi, the, gita, covers, the, core, beliefs, of, hinduism, including, difference, between, the, transient, body, and, the, eternal, self, the, transmigration, of, self, actuality, of, gunas, necessity, of, doing, one, s, duties, and, the, importance, of, detachment, the, text, analyses, the, paths, of, j, na, bhakti, karma, and, r, ja, yogas, for, the, purpose, of, moksha, spiritual, liberation, and, asserts, that, the, path, of, bhakti, devotion, is, the, foremost, and, easiest, of, all, numerous, classical, and, modern, thinkers, have, written, commentaries, on, the, gita, with, differing, views, on, its, essence, and, essentials, the, gita, in, the, title, of, the, bhagavad, gita, literally, means, song, religious, leaders, and, scholars, interpret, the, word, bhagavad, in, a, number, of, ways, accordingly, the, title, has, been, interpreted, as, the, song, of, god, the, word, of, god, by, the, theistic, schools, the, words, of, the, lord, the, divine, song, and, celestial, song, by, others, in, india, its, sanskrit, name, is, often, written, as, shrimad, bhagavad, gita, or, shrimad, bhagavadgita, or, where, the, shrimad, prefix, is, used, to, denote, a, high, degree, of, respect, the, bhagavad, gita, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, bhagavata, puran, which, is, one, of, the, eighteen, major, puranas, dealing, with, the, life, of, the, hindu, god, krishna, and, various, avatars, of, vishnu, the, work, is, also, known, as, the, iswara, gita, the, ananta, gita, the, hari, gita, the, vyasa, gita, or, the, gita, theories, on, the, date, of, the, composition, of, the, gita, vary, considerably, the, text, is, generally, dated, to, the, second, half, of, the, first, millennium, bce, some, scholars, accept, dates, from, the, 5th, century, bce, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, as, the, probable, range, the, latter, likely, the, hinduism, scholar, jeaneane, fowler, in, her, commentary, on, the, gita, considers, second, century, bce, to, be, the, probable, date, of, composition, j, a, b, van, buitenen, also, states, that, the, gita, was, likely, composed, about, 200, bce, according, to, the, indologist, arvind, sharma, the, gita, is, generally, accepted, to, be, a, 2nd, century, bce, text, kashi, nath, upadhyaya, in, contrast, dates, it, a, bit, earlier, he, states, that, the, gita, was, always, a, part, of, the, mahabharata, and, dating, the, latter, suffices, in, dating, the, gita, on, the, basis, of, the, estimated, dates, of, mahabharata, as, evidenced, by, exact, quotes, of, it, in, the, buddhist, literature, by, asvaghosa, c, 100, ce, upadhyaya, states, that, the, mahabharata, and, therefore, the, gita, must, have, been, well, known, by, then, for, a, buddhist, to, be, quoting, it, this, suggests, a, terminus, ante, quem, latest, date, of, the, gita, to, be, sometime, prior, to, the, 1st, century, ce, he, cites, similar, quotes, in, the, dharmasutra, texts, the, brahma, sutras, and, other, literature, to, conclude, that, the, bhagavad, gita, was, composed, in, the, fifth, or, fourth, century, bce, according, to, arthur, basham, the, context, of, the, bhagavad, gita, suggests, that, it, was, composed, in, an, era, when, the, ethics, of, war, were, being, questioned, and, renunciation, to, monastic, life, was, becoming, popular, such, an, era, emerged, after, the, rise, of, buddhism, and, jainism, in, the, 5th, century, bce, and, particularly, after, the, semi, legendary, life, of, ashoka, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, thus, the, first, version, of, the, bhagavad, gita, may, have, been, composed, in, or, after, the, 3rd, century, bce, winthrop, sargeant, linguistically, categorizes, the, bhagavad, gita, as, epic, puranic, sanskrit, a, language, that, succeeds, vedic, sanskrit, and, precedes, classical, sanskrit, the, text, has, occasional, pre, classical, elements, of, the, vedic, sanskrit, language, such, as, aorists, and, the, prohibitive, m, instead, of, the, expected, na, not, of, classical, sanskrit, this, suggests, that, the, text, was, composed, after, the, p, ini, era, but, before, the, long, compounds, of, classical, sanskrit, became, the, norm, this, would, date, the, text, as, transmitted, by, the, oral, tradition, to, the, later, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, and, the, first, written, version, probably, to, the, 2nd, or, 3rd, century, ce, according, to, jeaneane, fowler, the, dating, of, the, gita, varies, considerably, and, depends, in, part, on, whether, one, accepts, it, to, be, a, part, of, the, early, versions, of, the, mahabharata, or, a, text, that, was, inserted, into, the, epic, at, a, later, date, the, earliest, surviving, components, therefore, are, believed, to, be, no, older, than, the, earliest, external, references, we, have, to, the, mahabharata, epic, the, mahabharata, the, world, s, longest, poem, is, itself, a, text, that, was, likely, written, and, compiled, over, several, hundred, years, one, dated, between, 400, bce, or, little, earlier, and, 2nd, century, ce, though, some, claim, a, few, parts, can, be, put, as, late, as, 400, ce, states, fowler, the, dating, of, the, gita, is, thus, dependent, on, the, uncertain, dating, of, the, mahabharata, the, actual, dates, of, composition, of, the, gita, remain, unresolved, while, the, year, and, century, is, uncertain, states, richard, davis, the, internal, evidence, in, the, text, dates, the, origin, of, the, gita, discourse, to, the, hindu, lunar, month, of, margashirsha, also, called, agrahayana, generally, december, or, january, of, the, gregorian, calendar, in, the, indian, tradition, the, bhagavad, gita, as, well, as, the, epic, mahabharata, of, which, it, is, a, part, is, attributed, to, the, sage, vyasa, whose, full, name, was, krishna, dvaipayana, also, called, veda, vyasa, another, hindu, legend, states, that, vyasa, narrated, it, when, the, lord, ganesha, broke, one, of, his, tusks, and, wrote, down, the, mahabharata, along, with, the, bhagavad, gita, scholars, consider, vyasa, to, be, a, mythical, or, symbolic, author, in, part, because, vyasa, is, also, the, traditional, compiler, of, the, vedas, and, the, puranas, texts, dated, to, be, from, different, millennia, swami, vivekananda, the, 19th, century, hindu, monk, and, vedantist, stated, that, the, bhagavad, gita, may, be, old, but, it, was, mostly, unknown, in, indian, history, until, the, early, 8th, century, when, adi, shankara, shankaracharya, made, it, famous, by, writing, his, much, followed, commentary, on, it, some, infer, states, vivekananda, that, shankaracharya, was, the, author, of, gita, and, that, it, was, he, who, foisted, it, into, the, body, of, the, mahabharata, this, attribution, to, adi, shankara, is, unlikely, in, part, because, shankara, himself, refers, to, the, earlier, commentaries, on, the, bhagavad, gita, and, because, other, hindu, texts, and, traditions, that, compete, with, the, ideas, of, shankara, refer, to, much, older, literature, referencing, the, bhagavad, gita, though, much, of, this, ancient, secondary, literature, has, not, survived, into, the, modern, era, j, a, b, van, buitenen, an, indologist, known, for, his, translations, and, scholarship, on, mahabharata, finds, that, the, gita, is, so, contextually, and, philosophically, well, knit, within, the, mahabharata, that, it, was, not, an, independent, text, that, somehow, wandered, into, the, epic, the, gita, states, van, buitenen, was, conceived, and, developed, by, the, mahabharata, authors, to, bring, to, a, climax, and, solution, the, dharmic, dilemma, of, a, war, according, to, alexus, mcleod, a, scholar, of, philosophy, and, asian, studies, it, is, impossible, to, link, the, bhagavad, gita, to, a, single, author, and, it, may, be, the, work, of, many, authors, this, view, is, shared, by, the, indologist, arthur, basham, who, states, that, there, were, three, or, more, authors, or, compilers, of, bhagavad, gita, this, is, evidenced, by, the, discontinuous, intermixing, of, philosophical, verses, with, theistic, or, passionately, theistic, verses, according, to, basham, the, bhagavad, gita, is, a, prominent, and, influential, hindu, scripture, while, hinduism, is, known, for, its, diversity, and, the, synthesis, derived, from, it, the, bhagavad, gita, holds, a, unique, pan, hindu, influence, gerald, james, larson, an, indologist, and, scholar, of, classical, hindu, philosophy, states, that, if, there, is, any, one, text, that, comes, near, to, embodying, the, totality, of, what, it, is, to, be, a, hindu, it, would, be, the, bhagavad, gita, the, bhagavad, gita, is, part, of, the, prasthanatrayi, which, also, includes, the, upanishads, and, the, brahma, sutras, these, three, form, the, foundational, texts, of, the, vedanta, school, of, hindu, philosophy, the, brahma, sutras, constitute, the, ny, ya, prasth, na, or, the, starting, point, of, reasoning, canonical, base, while, the, principal, upanishads, constitute, the, sruti, prasth, na, or, the, starting, point, of, heard, scriptures, and, the, bhagavad, gita, constitutes, the, smriti, prasth, na, or, the, starting, point, of, remembered, canonical, base, while, upanishads, focuses, more, on, knowledge, and, the, identity, of, the, self, with, brahman, the, bhagavad, gita, shifts, the, emphasis, towards, devotion, and, the, worship, of, a, personal, deity, specifically, krishna, the, bhagavad, gita, forms, a, central, text, in, the, vaishnava, tradition, the, gita, is, one, of, the, key, texts, for, vedanta, a, school, of, thought, that, provides, one, of, the, theoretical, foundations, for, hinduism, and, one, that, has, had, an, enormous, influence, over, time, becoming, the, central, ideology, of, the, hindu, renaissance, in, the, 19th, century, some, hindus, give, it, the, status, of, an, upanishad, and, some, consider, it, to, be, a, revealed, text, there, are, alternate, versions, of, the, bhagavad, gita, such, as, the, one, found, in, kashmir, but, the, basic, message, behind, these, texts, are, not, distorted, the, bhagavad, gita, draws, heavily, from, the, philosophical, ideas, presented, in, the, upanishads, incorporating, and, expanding, upon, them, throughout, the, text, for, example, in, the, bhagavad, gita, s, second, chapter, krishna, explains, to, arjuna, about, the, eternal, nature, of, the, soul, a, concept, echoed, from, the, katha, upanishad, it, talks, about, the, concept, of, karma, yoga, mentioned, in, the, isha, upanishad, and, ideal, times, for, departing, from, life, echoing, teachings, from, the, chandogya, upanishad, the, bhagavad, gita, is, the, sealing, achievement, of, the, hindu, synthesis, incorporating, its, various, religious, traditions, the, synthesis, is, at, both, philosophical, and, socio, religious, levels, states, the, gita, scholar, keya, maitra, the, text, refrains, from, insisting, on, one, right, marga, path, to, spirituality, it, openly, synthesizes, and, inclusively, accepts, multiple, ways, of, life, harmonizing, spiritual, pursuits, through, action, karma, knowledge, j, na, and, devotion, bhakti, according, to, the, gita, translator, radhakrishnan, quoted, in, a, review, by, robinson, krishna, s, discourse, is, a, comprehensive, synthesis, that, inclusively, unifies, the, competing, strands, of, hindu, thought, such, as, vedic, ritual, upanishadic, wisdom, devotional, theism, and, philosophical, insight, aurobindo, described, the, text, as, a, synthesis, of, various, yogas, the, indologist, robert, minor, and, others, in, contrast, state, that, the, gita, is, more, clearly, defined, as, a, synthesis, of, vedanta, yoga, and, samkhya, philosophies, of, hinduism, the, synthesis, in, bhagavad, gita, addresses, the, question, of, what, constitutes, the, virtuous, path, that, is, necessary, for, spiritual, liberation, or, release, from, the, cycles, of, rebirth, moksha, it, discusses, whether, one, should, renounce, a, householder, lifestyle, for, a, life, as, an, ascetic, or, lead, a, householder, life, dedicated, to, one, s, duty, and, profession, or, pursue, a, householder, life, devoted, to, a, personalized, god, in, the, revealed, form, of, krishna, thus, gita, discusses, and, synthesizes, the, three, dominant, trends, in, hinduism, enlightenment, based, renunciation, dharma, based, householder, life, and, devotion, based, theism, according, to, eliot, deutsch, and, rohit, dalvi, the, bhagavad, gita, attempts, to, forge, a, harmony, between, these, three, paths, the, bhagavad, gita, s, synthetic, answer, recommends, that, one, must, resist, the, either, or, view, and, consider, a, both, and, view, it, states, that, the, dharmic, householder, can, achieve, the, same, goals, as, the, renouncing, monk, through, inner, renunciation, or, motiveless, action, one, must, do, the, right, thing, because, one, has, determined, that, it, is, right, states, gita, without, craving, for, its, fruits, without, worrying, about, the, results, loss, or, gain, desires, selfishness, and, the, craving, for, fruits, can, distort, one, from, spiritual, living, the, gita, synthesis, goes, further, according, to, its, interpreters, such, as, swami, vivekananda, and, the, text, states, that, there, is, living, god, in, every, human, being, and, the, devoted, service, to, this, living, god, in, everyone, without, craving, for, personal, rewards, is, a, means, to, spiritual, development, and, liberation, according, to, galvin, flood, the, teachings, in, the, gita, differ, from, other, indian, religions, that, encouraged, extreme, austerity, and, self, torture, of, various, forms, karsayanta, the, gita, disapproves, of, these, stating, that, not, only, is, it, against, tradition, but, against, krishna, himself, because, krishna, dwells, within, all, beings, in, torturing, the, body, the, ascetic, would, be, torturing, him, states, flood, even, a, monk, should, strive, for, inner, renunciation, rather, than, external, pretensions, the, gita, synthesizes, several, paths, to, spiritual, realization, based, on, the, premise, that, people, are, born, with, different, temperaments, and, tendencies, guna, smith, notes, that, the, text, acknowledges, that, some, individuals, are, more, reflective, and, intellectual, some, are, affective, and, engaged, by, their, emotions, some, are, action, driven, yet, others, favor, experimentation, and, exploring, what, works, it, then, presents, different, spiritual, paths, for, each, personality, type, respectively, the, path, of, knowledge, jnana, yoga, the, path, of, devotion, bhakti, yoga, the, path, of, action, karma, yoga, and, the, path, of, meditation, raja, yoga, the, guna, premise, is, a, synthesis, of, the, ideas, from, the, samkhya, school, of, hinduism, according, to, upadhyaya, the, gita, states, that, none, of, these, paths, to, spiritual, realization, is, intrinsically, superior, or, inferior, rather, they, converge, in, one, and, lead, to, the, same, goal, according, to, hiltebeitel, bhakti, forms, an, essential, ingredient, of, this, synthesis, and, the, text, incorporates, bhakti, into, vedanta, according, to, scheepers, the, bhagavad, gita, is, a, brahmanical, text, which, uses, shramanic, and, yogic, terminology, to, spread, the, brahmanic, idea, of, living, according, to, one, s, duty, or, dharma, in, contrast, to, the, ascetic, ideal, of, liberation, by, avoiding, all, karma, according, to, galvin, flood, and, charles, martin, the, gita, rejects, the, shramanic, path, of, non, action, emphasizing, instead, the, renunciation, of, the, fruits, of, action, the, bhagavad, gita, according, to, raju, is, a, great, synthesis, of, impersonal, spiritual, monism, with, personal, god, of, the, yoga, of, action, with, the, yoga, of, transcendence, of, action, and, these, again, with, the, yogas, of, devotion, and, knowledge, according, to, catherine, cornille, the, gita, presented, the, main, beliefs, of, hinduism, stressing, upon, the, importance, of, detachment, duty, prevalence, of, gunas, difference, between, body, and, immortal, soul, and, its, transmigration, the, text, assessed, the, paths, of, j, na, bhakti, karma, and, r, ja, yogas, for, the, purpose, of, moksha, spiritual, liberation, and, asserted, that, the, path, of, bhakti, devotion, is, the, foremost, and, the, easiest, of, them, all, the, bhagavad, gita, manuscript, is, found, in, the, sixth, book, of, the, mahabharata, manuscripts, the, bhisma, parvan, therein, in, the, third, section, the, gita, forms, chapters, 23, 40, that, is, 6, 3, 23, to, 6, 3, 40, the, bhagavad, gita, is, often, preserved, and, studied, on, its, own, as, an, independent, text, with, its, chapters, renumbered, from, 1, to, 18, the, bhagavad, gita, manuscripts, exist, in, numerous, indic, scripts, these, include, writing, systems, that, are, currently, in, use, as, well, as, early, scripts, such, as, the, now, dormant, sharada, script, variant, manuscripts, of, the, gita, have, been, found, on, the, indian, subcontinent, unlike, the, enormous, variations, in, the, remaining, sections, of, the, surviving, mahabharata, manuscripts, the, gita, manuscripts, show, only, minor, variations, according, to, gambhirananda, the, old, manuscripts, may, have, had, 745, verses, though, he, agrees, that, 700, verses, is, the, generally, accepted, historic, standard, gambhirananda, s, view, is, supported, by, a, few, versions, of, chapter, 6, 43, of, the, mahabharata, according, to, gita, exegesis, scholar, robert, minor, these, versions, state, that, the, gita, is, a, text, where, kesava, spoke, 574, slokas, arjuna, 84, sanjaya, 41, and, dhritarashtra, 1, an, authentic, manuscript, of, the, gita, with, 745, verses, has, not, been, found, adi, shankara, in, his, 8th, century, commentary, explicitly, states, that, the, gita, has, 700, verses, which, was, likely, a, deliberate, declaration, to, prevent, further, insertions, and, changes, to, the, gita, since, shankara, s, time, 700, verses, has, been, the, standard, benchmark, for, the, critical, edition, of, the, bhagavad, gita, the, bhagavad, gita, is, a, poem, written, in, the, sanskrit, language, its, 700, verses, are, structured, into, several, ancient, indian, poetic, meters, with, the, principal, being, the, shloka, anushtubh, chanda, it, has, 18, chapters, in, total, each, shloka, consists, of, a, couplet, thus, the, entire, text, consists, of, 1, 400, lines, each, shloka, has, two, quarter, verses, with, exactly, eight, syllables, each, of, these, quarters, is, further, arranged, into, two, metrical, feet, of, four, syllables, each, the, metered, verse, does, not, rhyme, while, the, shloka, is, the, principal, meter, in, the, gita, it, does, deploy, other, elements, of, sanskrit, prosody, which, refers, to, one, of, the, six, vedangas, or, limbs, of, vedic, statues, at, dramatic, moments, it, uses, the, tristubh, meter, found, in, the, vedas, where, each, line, of, the, couplet, has, two, quarter, verses, with, exactly, eleven, syllables, the, gita, is, a, dialogue, between, krishna, and, arjuna, right, before, the, start, of, the, climactic, kurukshetra, war, in, the, hindu, epic, mahabharata, two, massive, armies, have, gathered, to, destroy, each, other, the, pandava, prince, arjuna, asks, his, charioteer, krishna, to, drive, to, the, center, of, the, battlefield, so, that, he, can, get, a, good, look, at, both, the, armies, and, all, those, so, eager, for, war, he, sees, that, some, among, his, enemies, are, his, own, relatives, beloved, friends, and, revered, teachers, he, does, not, want, to, fight, to, kill, them, and, is, thus, filled, with, doubt, and, despair, on, the, battlefield, he, drops, his, bow, wonders, if, he, should, renounce, and, just, leave, the, battlefield, he, turns, to, his, charioteer, and, guide, krishna, for, advice, on, the, rationale, for, war, his, choices, and, the, right, thing, to, do, the, bhagavad, gita, is, the, compilation, of, arjuna, s, questions, and, moral, dilemma, and, krishna, s, answers, and, insights, that, elaborate, on, a, variety, of, philosophical, concepts, the, compiled, dialogue, goes, far, beyond, the, rationale, for, war, it, touches, on, many, human, ethical, dilemmas, philosophical, issues, and, life, s, choices, according, to, flood, and, martin, although, the, gita, is, set, in, the, context, of, a, wartime, epic, the, narrative, is, structured, to, apply, to, all, situations, it, wrestles, with, questions, about, who, we, are, how, we, should, live, our, lives, and, how, should, we, act, in, the, world, according, to, sargeant, it, delves, into, questions, about, the, purpose, of, life, crisis, of, self, identity, human, self, human, temperaments, and, ways, for, spiritual, quest, the, gita, posits, the, existence, of, two, selfs, in, an, individual, and, its, presentation, of, krishna, arjuna, dialogue, has, been, interpreted, as, a, metaphor, for, an, eternal, dialogue, between, the, two, the, bhagavad, gita, contains, 18, chapters, and, 700, verses, found, in, the, bhishma, parva, of, the, epic, mahabharata, because, of, differences, in, recensions, the, verses, of, the, gita, may, be, numbered, in, the, full, text, of, the, mahabharata, as, chapters, 6, 25, 42, or, as, chapters, 6, 23, 40, the, number, of, verses, in, each, chapter, vary, in, some, manuscripts, of, the, gita, discovered, on, the, indian, subcontinent, however, variant, readings, are, relatively, few, in, contrast, to, the, numerous, versions, of, the, mahabharata, it, is, found, embedded, in, the, original, bhagavad, gita, has, no, chapter, titles, some, sanskrit, editions, that, separate, the, gita, from, the, epic, as, an, independent, text, as, well, as, translators, however, add, chapter, titles, for, example, swami,

beyond, kshara, whoever, truly, recognizes, this, has, reached, the, ultimate, goal, according, to, franklin, edgerton, the, verses, in, this, chapter, in, association, with, select, verses, in, other, chapters, make, the, metaphysics, of, the, gita, to, be, dualistic, however, its, overall, thesis, according, to, edgerton, is, more, complex, because, other, verses, teach, the, upanishadic, doctrines, and, through, its, god, the, gita, seems, after, all, to, arrive, at, an, ultimate, monism, the, essential, part, the, fundamental, element, in, every, thing, is, after, all, one, is, god,

creatures, fairness, compassion, and, patience, are, marks, of, the, divine, nature, the, opposite, of, these, are, demonic, such, as, cruelty, conceit, hypocrisy, and, being, inhumane, states, krishna, some, of, the, verses, in, chapter, 16, may, be, polemics, directed, against, competing, indian, religions, according, to, basham, the, competing, tradition, may, be, the, materialists, charvaka, states, fowler, translators, title, the, chapter, as, shraddhatraya, vibhaga, yoga, religion, by, the, threefold, kinds, of, faith, the, power, of, faith, or, the, yoga, of, the, threefold,

their, spiritual, journey, the, final, verse, of, the, chapter, stresses, that, genuine, faith, shraddha, is, essential, for, spiritual, growth, actions, without, faith, are, meaningless, both, in,

a, householder, it, teaches, karma, phala, tyaga, renunciation, of, the, fruits, of, actions, emphasizing, the, renunciation, of, attachment, to, the, outcomes, of, actions, and, performing, duties, with, selflessness, and, devotion, the, gita, adopts, the, upanishadic, concept, of, absolute, reality, brahman, a, shift, from, the, earlier, ritual, driven, vedic, religion, to, one, abstracting, and, internalizing, spiritual, experiences, according, to, jeaneane, fowler, the, gita, builds, on, the, upanishadic, brahman, theme, conceptualized, to, be, that, which, is, everywhere, unaffected, constant, absolute, indescribable, and, nirguna, abstract, without, features, this, absolute, in, the, gita, is, neither, a, he, nor, a, she, but, a, neuter, principle, an, it, or, that, like, some, of, the, upanishads, the, gita, does, not, limit, itself, to, the, nirguna, brahman, it, teaches, both, the, abstract, and, the, personalized, brahman, god, the, latter, in, the, form, of, krishna, it, accomplishes, this, synthesis, by, projecting, the, nirguna, brahman, as, higher, than, saguna, or, personalized, brahman, where, the, nirguna, brahman, exists, when, everything, else, does, not, the, text, blurs, any, distinction, between, a, personalized, god, and, impersonal, absolute, reality, by, amalgamating, the, two, and, using, the, concepts, interchangeably, in, later, chapters, this, theme, has, led, scholars, to, call, the, gita, panentheistic, theistic, as, well, as, monistic, the, gita, states, fowler, thoroughly, accepts, atman, as, a, foundational, concept, in, the, upanishads, this, is, the, brahmanical, idea, that, all, beings, have, a, permanent, real, self, the, true, essence, the, self, it, refers, to, as, atman, self, in, the, upanishads, that, preceded, the, gita, such, as, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, the, salvational, goal, is, to, know, and, realize, this, self, a, knowledge, that, is, devoid, of, the, delusions, of, the, instinctive, i, mine, egoism, typically, connected, with, the, body, and, material, life, processes, that, are, impermanent, and, transient, the, gita, accepts, atman, as, the, pure, unchanging, ultimate, real, essence, the, gita, considers, the, world, to, be, transient, all, bodies, and, matter, as, impermanent, everything, that, constitutes, prakriti, nature, matter, is, process, driven, and, has, a, finite, existence, it, is, born, grows, matures, decays, and, dies, it, considers, this, transient, reality, as, maya, like, the, upanishads, the, gita, focuses, on, what, it, considers, real, in, this, world, of, change, impermanence, and, finitude, to, build, its, theological, framework, about, the, world, the, text, relies, on, the, theories, found, in, the, samkhya, and, vedanta, schools, of, hinduism, the, upanishads, developed, the, equation, atman, brahman, states, fowler, and, this, belief, is, central, to, the, gita, this, equation, is, however, interpreted, in, a, number, of, ways, by, different, sub, schools, of, vedanta, in, the, gita, the, self, of, each, human, being, is, considered, to, be, identical, to, every, other, human, being, and, all, beings, but, it, does, not, support, an, identity, with, the, brahman, according, to, fowler, according, to, raju, the, gita, supports, this, identity, and, spiritual, monism, but, as, a, form, of, synthesis, with, a, personal, god, according, to, edgerton, the, authors, of, the, gita, rely, on, their, concept, of, a, personalized, god, krishna, to, ultimately, arrive, at, an, ultimate, monism, where, the, devotee, realizes, that, krishna, is, the, essential, part, the, real, fundamental, element, within, everyone, and, everything, krishna, is, simultaneously, one, and, all, according, to, huston, smith, the, gita, is, teaching, that, when, one, sees, the, entire, universe, as, pervaded, by, the, single, universal, spirit, one, contemplates, marvels, and, falls, in, love, with, its, amazing, glory, having, experienced, that, truth, oneself, all, doubts, are, dispelled, this, is, how, the, flower, of, devotion, evolves, into, the, fruit, of, knowledge, the, gita, teaches, several, spiritual, paths, jnana, bhakti, and, karma, to, the, divine, however, states, fowler, it, does, not, raise, any, of, these, to, a, status, that, excludes, the, others, the, theme, that, unites, these, paths, in, the, gita, is, inner, renunciation, where, one, is, unattached, to, personal, rewards, during, one, s, spiritual, journey, the, gita, teaches, the, path, of, karma, yoga, in, chapter, 3, and, others, it, upholds, the, necessity, of, action, however, this, action, should, not, simply, follow, spiritual, injunctions, without, any, attachment, to, personal, rewards, or, because, of, craving, for, fruits, the, gita, teaches, according, to, fowler, that, the, action, should, be, undertaken, after, proper, knowledge, has, been, applied, to, gain, a, full, perspective, on, what, the, action, should, be, the, concept, of, such, detached, action, is, also, called, nishkama, karma, a, term, not, used, in, the, gita, but, equivalent, to, other, terms, such, as, karma, phala, tyaga, this, is, where, one, determines, what, the, right, action, ought, to, be, and, then, acts, while, being, detached, to, personal, outcomes, to, fruits, to, success, or, failure, a, karma, yogi, finds, such, work, inherently, fulfilling, and, satisfying, to, a, karma, yogi, right, work, done, well, is, a, form, of, prayer, and, karma, yoga, is, the, path, of, selfless, action, according, to, mahatma, gandhi, the, object, of, the, gita, is, to, show, the, way, to, attain, self, realization, and, this, can, be, achieved, by, selfless, action, by, desireless, action, by, renouncing, fruits, of, action, by, dedicating, all, activities, to, god, i, e, by, surrendering, oneself, to, him, body, and, self, gandhi, called, the, gita, the, gospel, of, selfless, action, according, to, jonardon, ganeri, the, premise, of, disinterested, action, is, one, of, the, important, ethical, concepts, in, the, gita, in, the, bhagavad, gita, bhakti, is, characterized, as, the, loving, devotion, a, longing, surrender, trust, and, adoration, of, the, divine, krishna, as, the, ishta, devata, while, bhakti, is, mentioned, in, many, chapters, the, idea, gathers, momentum, after, verse, 6, 30, and, chapter, 12, is, where, is, fully, developed, according, to, fowler, the, bhakti, in, the, gita, does, not, imply, renunciation, of, action, but, the, bhakti, effort, is, assisted, with, right, knowledge, and, dedication, to, one, s, dharma, theologian, catherine, cornille, writes, the, text, offers, a, survey, of, the, different, possible, disciplines, for, attaining, liberation, through, knowledge, jnana, action, karma, and, loving, devotion, to, god, bhakti, focusing, on, the, latter, as, both, the, easiest, and, the, highest, path, to, salvation, according, to, m, r, sampatkumaran, a, bhagavad, gita, scholar, the, gita, s, message, is, that, mere, knowledge, of, the, scriptures, cannot, lead, to, final, release, but, devotion, meditation, and, worship, are, essential, the, gita, likely, spawned, a, powerful, devotionalism, movement, states, fowler, because, the, text, and, this, path, was, simpler, and, available, to, everyone, jnana, yoga, is, the, path, of, knowledge, wisdom, and, direct, realization, of, the, brahman, in, the, bhagavad, gita, it, is, also, referred, to, as, buddhi, yoga, and, its, goal, is, self, realization, the, text, states, that, this, is, the, path, that, intellectuals, tend, to, prefer, the, chapter, 4, of, the, bhagavad, gita, is, dedicated, to, the, general, exposition, of, jnana, yoga, the, gita, praises, the, path, calling, the, jnana, yogi, to, be, exceedingly, dear, to, krishna, but, adds, that, the, path, is, steep, and, difficult, sivananda, s, commentary, regards, the, eighteen, chapters, of, the, bhagavad, gita, as, having, a, progressive, order, by, which, krishna, leads, arjuna, up, the, ladder, of, yoga, from, one, rung, to, another, the, influential, commentator, madhusudana, sarasvati, divided, the, gita, s, eighteen, chapters, into, three, sections, with, six, chapters, each, swami, gambhirananda, characterises, madhusudana, sarasvati, s, system, as, a, successive, approach, in, which, karma, yoga, leads, to, bhakti, yoga, which, in, turn, leads, to, jnana, yoga, some, scholars, treat, the, yoga, of, meditation, to, be, a, distinct, fourth, path, taught, in, the, gita, referring, to, it, as, raja, yoga, others, consider, it, a, progressive, stage, or, a, combination, of, karma, yoga, and, bhakti, yoga, some, such, as, adi, shankara, have, considered, its, discussion, in, the, 13th, chapter, of, the, gita, and, elsewhere, to, be, an, integral, part, of, jnana, yoga, the, gita, rejects, ascetic, life, renunciation, as, well, as, brahminical, vedic, ritualism, where, outward, actions, or, non, actions, are, considered, a, means, of, personal, reward, in, life, after, life, or, as, a, means, of, liberation, instead, it, recommends, the, pursuit, of, an, active, life, where, the, individual, adopts, inner, renunciation, acts, to, fulfill, what, he, determines, to, be, his, dharma, without, craving, for, or, being, concerned, about, personal, rewards, viewing, this, as, an, inner, sacrifice, to, the, personal, god, for, a, higher, good, according, to, edwin, bryant, the, indologist, with, publications, on, krishna, related, hindu, traditions, the, gita, rejects, actionless, behavior, found, in, some, indic, monastic, traditions, it, also, relegates, the, sacrificial, system, of, the, early, vedic, literature, to, a, path, that, goes, nowhere, because, it, is, based, on, desires, states, bryant, dharma, is, a, prominent, paradigm, of, the, mahabharata, and, it, is, referenced, in, the, gita, as, well, the, term, dharma, has, a, number, of, meanings, fundamentally, it, refers, to, that, which, is, right, or, just, contextually, it, also, means, the, essence, of, duty, law, class, social, norms, ritual, and, cosmos, itself, in, the, text, in, the, sense, the, way, things, should, be, in, all, these, different, dimensions, according, to, zaehner, the, term, dharma, means, duty, in, the, gita, s, context, in, verse, 2, 7, it, refers, to, the, right, and, in, 14, 27, to, the, eternal, law, of, righteousness, few, verses, in, the, bhagavad, gita, deal, with, dharma, according, to, the, indologist, paul, hacker, but, the, theme, of, dharma, is, broadly, important, in, chapter, 1, responding, to, arjuna, s, despondency, krishna, asks, him, to, follow, his, sva, dharma, the, dharma, that, belongs, to, a, particular, man, arjuna, as, a, member, of, a, particular, varna, i, e, the, kshatriya, the, warrior, varna, according, to, paul, hacker, the, term, dharma, has, additional, meanings, in, the, context, of, arjuna, it, is, more, broadly, the, duty, and, a, metaphysically, congealed, act, for, arjuna, according, to, the, indologist, jacqueline, hirst, the, dharma, theme, is, of, significance, only, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, gita, and, this, may, have, been, a, way, to, perhaps, link, the, gita, to, the, context, of, the, mahabharata, according, to, malinar, arjuna, s, crisis, and, some, of, the, arguments, put, forward, to, call, him, to, action, are, connected, to, the, debates, on, war, and, peace, in, the, udyoga, parva, the, udyoga, parva, presents, many, views, about, the, nature, of, a, warrior, his, duty, and, what, calls, for, heroic, action, while, duryodhana, presents, it, as, a, matter, of, status, social, norms, and, fate, vidura, states, that, the, heroic, warrior, never, submits, knows, no, fear, and, has, the, duty, to, protect, people, the, bhishma, parva, sets, the, stage, of, two, ideologies, in, conflict, and, two, massive, armies, gathered, for, what, each, considers, as, a, righteous, and, necessary, war, in, this, context, the, gita, advises, arjuna, to, do, his, holy, duty, sva, dharma, as, a, warrior, fight, and, kill, according, to, the, indologist, barbara, miller, the, text, frames, heroism, not, in, terms, of, physical, abilities, but, instead, in, terms, of, effort, and, inner, commitment, to, fulfill, a, warrior, s, dharma, in, the, battlefield, war, is, depicted, as, a, horror, the, impending, slaughter, a, cause, for, self, doubt, yet, at, stake, is, the, spiritual, struggle, against, evil, the, gita, s, message, emphasizes, that, personal, moral, ambivalence, must, be, addressed, the, warrior, needs, to, rise, above, personal, and, social, values, and, understand, what, is, at, stake, and, why, he, must, fight, the, text, explores, the, paradoxical, interconnectedness, of, disciplined, action, and, freedom, the, first, reference, to, dharma, in, the, bhagavad, gita, occurs, in, its, first, verse, where, dhritarashtra, refers, to, the, kurukshetra, the, location, of, the, battlefield, as, the, field, of, dharma, the, field, of, righteousness, or, truth, according, to, fowler, dharma, in, this, verse, may, refer, to, the, sanatana, dharma, what, hindus, understand, as, their, religion, for, it, is, a, term, that, encompasses, wide, aspects, of, religious, and, traditional, thought, and, is, more, readily, used, for, religion, therefore, field, of, dharma, implies, the, field, of, righteousness, where, truth, will, eventually, triumph, states, fowler, according, to, jacqueline, hirst, the, field, of, dharma, phrase, in, the, gita, epitomizes, that, the, struggle, concerns, dharma, itself, this, dharma, has, resonances, at, many, different, levels, unlike, any, other, religious, scripture, the, bhagavad, gita, broadcasts, its, message, in, the, centre, of, a, battlefield, several, modern, indian, writers, have, interpreted, the, battlefield, setting, as, an, allegory, for, the, war, within, eknath, easwaran, writes, that, the, gita, s, subject, is, the, war, within, the, struggle, for, self, mastery, that, every, human, being, must, wage, if, he, or, she, is, to, emerge, from, life, victorious, swami, nikhilananda, takes, arjuna, as, an, allegory, of, tman, krishna, as, an, allegory, of, brahman, arjuna, s, chariot, as, the, body, and, dhritarashtra, as, the, ignorant, mind, nikhilananda, s, allegorical, interpretation, is, shared, by, huston, smith, swami, vivekananda, interprets, the, first, discourse, in, the, gita, as, well, as, the, kurukshetra, war, allegorically, vivekananda, states, that, when, we, sum, up, its, esoteric, significance, it, means, the, war, which, is, constantly, going, on, within, man, between, the, tendencies, of, good, and, evil, mohandas, karamchand, gandhi, in, his, commentary, on, the, gita, interprets, the, battle, as, an, allegory, in, which, the, battlefield, is, the, soul, and, arjuna, embodies, man, s, higher, impulses, struggling, against, evil, in, aurobindo, s, view, krishna, was, a, historical, figure, but, his, significance, in, the, gita, is, as, a, symbol, of, the, divine, dealings, with, humanity, while, arjuna, typifies, a, struggling, human, soul, however, aurobindo, rejected, the, interpretation, that, the, gita, and, the, mahabharata, by, extension, is, only, an, allegory, of, the, inner, life, and, therefore, that, it, has, nothing, to, do, with, our, outward, human, life, and, actions, other, scholars, such, as, steven, rosen, laurie, l, patton, and, stephen, mitchell, have, seen, in, the, gita, a, religious, defense, of, the, warrior, class, kshatriya, varna, duty, svadharma, which, is, to, wage, war, with, courage, they, do, not, see, only, an, allegorical, teaching, but, also, a, real, defense, of, just, war, indian, independence, leaders, like, lala, lajpat, rai, and, bal, gangadhar, tilak, saw, the, gita, as, a, text, which, defended, war, when, necessary, and, used, it, to, promote, armed, rebellion, against, colonial, rule, lajpat, rai, wrote, an, article, on, the, message, of, the, bhagavad, gita, he, saw, the, main, message, as, the, bravery, and, courage, of, arjuna, to, fight, as, a, warrior, bal, gangadhar, tilak, saw, the, gita, as, defending, killing, when, necessary, for, the, betterment, of, society, such, as, for, example, the, killing, of, afzal, khan, because, by, the, end, of, the, gita, krishna, convinces, arjuna, that, it, is, his, right, and, duty, to, fight, the, gita, has, been, argued, by, some, as, pro, war, others, argue, it, is, neither, pro, nor, anti, war, noted, author, christopher, isherwood, suffered, the, death, of, his, father, in, wwi, and, saw, no, serious, effort, by, the, allies, to, avoid, plunging, head, long, into, the, next, war, in, his, novels, the, berlin, stories, he, describes, life, in, germany, as, the, nazis, rose, to, power, in, the, late, 1930s, isherwood, with, advice, from, and, influence, of, aldous, huxley, and, gerald, heard, he, became, a, practicing, pacifist, and, conscientiousness, objector, working, with, the, quakers, doing, alternative, service, to, help, settle, jewish, refugees, fleeing, the, war, in, 1944, isherwood, worked, with, swami, prabhavananda, of, the, vedanta, society, of, southern, california, to, translate, the, bhagavad, gita, into, english, in, the, appendix, there, is, an, essay, written, by, isherwood, titled, the, gita, and, war, he, argues, that, in, certain, circumstances, it, would, be, quite, alright, to, refuse, to, fight, in, arjuna, s, particular, circumstances, since, it, is, a, righteous, war, and, he, s, a, warrior, by, birth, and, trade, he, must, fight, every, action, under, certain, circumstances, and, for, certain, people, may, be, a, stepping, stone, to, spiritual, growth, if, it, is, done, in, the, spirit, of, non, attachment, there, is, no, question, here, of, doing, evil, that, good, may, come, the, gita, does, not, countenance, such, opportunism, arjuna, is, to, do, the, best, he, knows, in, order, to, pass, beyond, that, best, to, better, in, the, gita, krishna, persuades, arjuna, to, wage, war, where, the, enemy, includes, some, of, his, own, relatives, and, friends, in, light, of, the, ahimsa, non, violence, teachings, in, hindu, scriptures, the, gita, has, been, criticized, as, violating, the, ahimsa, value, or, alternatively, as, supporting, political, violence, the, justification, of, political, violence, when, peaceful, protests, and, all, else, fails, states, varma, has, been, a, fairly, common, feature, of, modern, indian, political, thought, along, with, the, mighty, antithesis, of, gandhian, thought, on, non, violence, during, the, independence, movement, in, india, hindus, considered, the, active, burning, and, drowning, of, british, goods, while, technically, illegal, under, colonial, legislation, these, acts, were, viewed, as, a, moral, and, just, war, for, the, sake, of, liberty, and, righteous, values, of, the, type, that, the, gita, discusses, according, to, paul, schaffel, the, influential, hindu, nationalist, v, d, savarkar, often, turned, to, hindu, scripture, such, as, the, bhagavad, gita, arguing, that, the, text, justified, violence, against, those, who, would, harm, mother, india, v, r, narla, in, his, book, length, critique, of, the, text, titled, the, truth, about, the, gita, criticizes, the, ethical, teachings, of, the, gita, he, argues, that, the, ethics, of, the, gita, are, so, ambiguous, that, one, can, use, it, to, justify, any, ethical, position, narla, argues, that, the, gita, is, mainly, a, theological, argument, in, favor, of, the, warrior, ethos, narla, argues, that, the, fact, that, the, gita, tries, constantly, to, make, arjuna, kill, his, kin, in, order, to, gain, a, petty, kingdom, shows, it, is, not, a, pacifist, work, narla, compares, the, krishna, of, the, gita, with, a, modern, day, terrorist, who, uses, theology, to, excuse, violence, narla, also, cites, d, d, kosambi, who, argued, that, the, apparent, moral, of, the, gita, is, kill, your, brother, if, duty, calls, without, passion, as, long, as, you, have, faith, in, me, all, sins, are, forgiven, in, his, myth, and, reality, the, indian, historian, d, d, kosambi, argued, that, the, gita, was, written, as, a, religious, text, that, could, provide, support, for, the, actions, of, the, upper, castes, including, the, warrior, caste, these, sort, of, exhortations, to, battle, would, not, have, been, uncommon, in, ancient, india, as, it, was, the, job, of, indian, bards, kosambi, writes, that, in, the, gita, the, high, god, repeatedly, emphasizes, the, great, virtue, of, non, killing, ahimsa, yet, the, entire, discourse, is, an, incentive, to, war, he, also, cites, the, gita, which, states, if, slain, you, gain, heaven, if, victorious, the, earth, so, up, son, of, kunti, and, concentrate, on, fighting, kosambi, argues, that, the, injunctions, and, excuses, for, killing, found, in, the, gita, are, unethical, the, indian, jurist, and, politician, b, r, ambedkar, also, saw, the, gita, s, defense, of, violence, based, on, the, eternity, of, the, soul, atman, as, unethical, ambedkar, wrote, that, to, say, that, killing, is, no, killing, because, what, is, killed, is, the, body, and, not, the, soul, is, an, unheard, of, defense, of, murder, if, krishna, were, to, appear, as, a, lawyer, acting, for, a, client, who, is, being, tried, for, murder, and, pleaded, the, defense, set, out, by, him, in, the, bhagavad, gita, there, is, not, the, slightest, doubt, that, he, would, be, sent, to, the, lunatic, asylum, in, his, introduction, to, his, translation, of, the, gita, purushottama, lal, argues, that, while, arjuna, appears, as, a, pacifist, concerned, with, ahimsa, krishna, is, the, militarist, who, convinces, him, to, kill, according, to, lal, krishna, makes, use, of, a, startling, argument, to, convince, arjuna, to, kill, which, lal, outlines, as, the, atman, is, eternal, only, the, body, dies, so, go, ahead, and, kill, you, will, kill, only, the, body, the, atman, will, remain, unaffected, lal, states, that, there, could, hardly, be, a, better, example, of, forked, tongue, speciousness, lal, further, argues, that, the, truth, of, the, matter, surely, is, that, no, rational, refutation, is, possible, of, the, essential, humanist, position, that, killing, is, wrong, many, of, the, answers, given, by, krishna, appear, to, be, evasive, and, occasionally, sophistic, when, logic, fails, krishna, apparently, resorts, to, divine, magic, according, to, lal, in, the, gita, krishna, stuns, arjuna, with, a, glorious, revelation, of, psychedelic, intensity, this, confidence, trick, is, problematic, for, lal, who, sees, arjuna, s, plight, as, a, painful, and, honest, problem, that, krishna, should, have, faced, on, its, own, terms, painfully, and, honestly, and, did, not, mahatma, gandhi, credited, his, commitment, for, ahimsa, to, the, gita, for, gandhi, the, gita, is, teaching, that, people, should, fight, for, justice, and, righteous, values, that, they, should, never, meekly, suffer, injustice, to, avoid, a, war, according, to, the, indologist, ananya, vajpeyi, the, gita, does, not, elaborate, on, the, means, or, stages, of, war, nor, on, ahimsa, except, for, stating, that, ahimsa, is, virtuous, and, characterizes, an, awakened, steadfast, ethical, man, for, gandhi, states, vajpeyi, ahimsa, is, the, relationship, between, self, and, other, as, he, and, his, fellow, indians, battled, against, colonial, rule, gandhian, ahimsa, is, in, fact, the, essence, of, the, entire, gita, according, to, vajpeyi, the, teachings, of, the, gita, on, ahimsa, are, ambiguous, states, arvind, sharma, and, this, is, best, exemplified, by, the, fact, that, nathuram, godse, stated, the, gita, as, his, inspiration, to, do, his, dharma, after, he, assassinated, mahatma, gandhi, thomas, merton, the, trappist, monk, and, author, of, books, on, zen, buddhism, concurs, with, gandhi, and, states, that, the, gita, is, not, teaching, violence, nor, propounding, a, make, war, ideology, instead, it, is, teaching, peace, and, discussing, one, s, duty, to, examine, what, is, right, and, then, act, with, pure, intentions, when, one, faces, difficult, and, repugnant, choices, liberation, or, moksha, in, vedanta, philosophy, is, not, something, that, can, be, acquired, tman, self, and, self, knowledge, along, with, the, loss, of, egotistic, ignorance, the, goal, of, moksha, is, something, that, is, always, present, as, the, essence, of, the, self, and, must, be, realized, by, each, person, by, one, s, own, effort, while, the, upanishads, largely, uphold, such, a, monistic, viewpoint, of, liberation, the, bhagavad, gita, also, accommodates, the, dualistic, and, theistic, aspects, of, moksha, the, gita, while, including, impersonal, nirguna, brahman, as, the, goal, mainly, revolves, around, the, relationship, between, the, self, and, a, personal, god, or, saguna, brahman, a, synthesis, of, knowledge, devotion, and, desireless, action, is, offered, by, krishna, as, a, spectrum, of, choices, to, arjuna, the, same, combination, is, suggested, to, the, reader, as, a, way, to, moksha, christopher, chapple, a, scholar, focusing, on, indian, religions, in, winthrop, sargeant, s, translation, of, the, gita, states, that, in, the, model, presented, by, the, bhagavad, gita, every, aspect, of, life, is, in, fact, a, way, of, salvation, according, to, dennis, hudson, there, is, an, overlap, between, vedic, and, tantric, rituals, within, the, teachings, found, in, the, bhagavad, gita, he, places, the, pancaratra, agama, in, the, last, three, or, four, centuries, of, 1st, millennium, bce, and, proposes, that, both, the, tantric, and, vedic, the, agama, and, the, gita, share, the, same, v, sudeva, krishna, roots, some, of, the, ideas, in, the, bhagavad, gita, connect, it, to, the, shatapatha, brahmana, of, yajurveda, the, shatapatha, brahmana, for, example, mentions, the, absolute, purusha, who, dwells, in, every, human, being, according, to, hudson, a, story, in, this, vedic, text, highlights, the, meaning, of, the, name, v, sudeva, as, the, shining, one, deva, who, dwells, vasu, in, all, things, and, in, whom, all, things, dwell, and, the, meaning, of, vishnu, to, be, the, pervading, actor, in, bhagavad, gita, similarly, krishna, identified, himself, both, with, v, sudeva, vishnu, and, their, meanings, the, ideas, at, the, center, of, vedic, rituals, in, shatapatha, brahmana, and, the, teachings, of, the, bhagavad, gita, revolve, around, this, absolute, person, the, primordial, genderless, absolute, which, is, the, same, as, the, goal, of, pancaratra, agama, and, tantra, the, first, english, translation, of, the, bhagavad, gita, was, published, by, charles, wilkins, in, 1785, the, wilkins, translation, had, an, introduction, to, the, gita, by, warren, hastings, soon, the, work, was, translated, into, other, european, languages, such, as, french, 1787, german, and, russian, in, 1849, the, weleyan, mission, press, bangalore, published, the, bhagavat, geeta, or, dialogues, of, krishna, and, arjoon, in, eighteen, lectures, with, sanskrit, canarese, and, english, in, parallel, columns, edited, by, rev, john, garrett, with, the, effort, being, supported, by, sir, mark, cubbon, in, 1981, larson, stated, that, a, complete, listing, of, gita, translations, and, a, related, secondary, bibliography, would, be, nearly, endless, 514, according, to, larson, there, is, a, massive, translational, tradition, in, english, pioneered, by, the, british, solidly, grounded, philologically, by, the, french, and, germans, provided, with, its, indigenous, roots, by, a, rich, heritage, of, modern, indian, comment, and, reflection, extended, into, various, disciplinary, areas, by, americans, and, having, generated, in, our, time, a, broadly, based, cross, cultural, awareness, of, the, importance, of, the, bhagavad, gita, both, as, an, expression, of, a, specifically, indian, spirituality, and, as, one, of, the, great, religious, classics, of, all, time, 518, according, to, sargeant, the, gita, is, said, to, have, been, translated, at, least, 200, times, in, both, poetic, and, prose, forms, richard, davis, cites, a, count, by, callewaert, hemraj, in, 1982, of, 1, 891, translations, of, the, bhagavad, gita, in, 75, languages, including, 273, in, english, these, translations, vary, and, are, in, part, an, interpretative, reconstruction, of, the, original, sanskrit, text, that, differ, in, their, friendliness, to, the, reader, and, in, the, amount, of, violence, to, the, original, gita, text, the, translations, and, interpretations, of, the, gita, have, been, so, diverse, that, these, have, been, used, to, support, apparently, contradictory, political, and, philosophical, values, for, example, galvin, flood, and, charles, martin, note, that, interpretations, of, the, gita, have, been, used, to, support, pacifism, to, aggressive, nationalism, in, politics, from, monism, to, theism, in, philosophy, according, to, william, johnson, the, synthesis, of, ideas, in, the, gita, is, such, that, it, can, bear, almost, any, shade, of, interpretation, a, translation, can, never, fully, reproduce, an, original, and, no, translation, is, transparent, states, richard, davis, but, in, the, case, of, the, gita, the, linguistic, and, cultural, distance, for, many, translators, is, large, and, steep, which, adds, to, the, challenge, and, affects, the, translation, for, some, native, translators, their, personal, beliefs, motivations, and, subjectivity, affect, their, understanding, their, choice, of, words, and, interpretation, some, translations, by, indians, with, or, without, western, co, translators, have, orientalist, apologetic, neo, vedantic, or, guru, phenomenon, biases, 525, 530, according, to, the, exegesis, scholar, robert, minor, the, gita, is, probably, the, most, translated, of, any, asian, text, but, many, modern, versions, heavily, reflect, the, views, of, the, organization, or, person, who, does, the, translating, and, distribution, in, minor, s, view, the, harvard, scholar, franklin, edgerton, s, english, translation, and, richard, garbe, s, german, translation, are, closer, to, the, text, than, many, others, according, to, larson, the, edgerton, translation, is, remarkably, faithful, but, it, is, harsh, stilted, and, syntactically, awkward, with, an, orientalist, bias, and, lacks, appreciation, of, the, text, s, contemporary, religious, significance, 524, the, gita, has, also, been, translated, into, european, languages, other, than, english, in, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, in, the, mughal, empire, multiple, persian, translations, of, the, gita, were, completed, in, 1808, passages, from, the, gita, were, part, of, the, first, direct, translation, of, sanskrit, into, german, appearing, in, a, book, through, which, friedrich, schlegel, became, known, as, the, founder, of, indian, philology, in, germany, the, most, significant, french, translation, of, the, gita, according, to, j, a, b, van, buitenen, was, published, by, mile, senart, in, 1922, more, recently, a, new, french, translation, was, produced, by, the, indologist, alain, porte, in, 2004, swami, rambhadracharya, released, the, first, braille, version, of, the, scripture, with, the,

the, bhagavad, gita, which, focus, on, karma, yoga, jnana, yoga, and, bhakti, yoga, in, relation, to, the, gita, yogananda, s, work, stresses, the, training, of, one, s, mind, or, raja, yoga, bhagavad, gita, integrates, various, schools, of, thought, notably, vedanta, samkhya, and, yoga, and, other, theistic, ideas, it, remains, a, popular, text, for, commentators, belonging, to, various, philosophical, schools, however, its, composite, nature, also, leads, to, varying, interpretations, of, the, text, and, historic, scholars, have, written, bhashya, commentaries, on, it, many, classical, and, modern, hindu, intellectuals, have, written, commentaries, on, the, gita, according, to, mysore, hiriyanna, the, gita, is, one, of, the, hardest, books, to, interpret, which, accounts, for, the, numerous, commentaries, on, it, each, differing, from, the, rest, in, one, essential, point, or, the, other, according, to, richard, davis, the, gita, has, attracted, much, scholarly, interest, in, indian, history, and, some, 227, commentaries, have, survived, in, the, sanskrit, language, alone, it, has, also, attracted, commentaries, in, regional, vernacular, languages, for, centuries, such, as, the, one, by, sant, dnyaneshwar, in, marathi, 13th, century, the, bhagavad, gita, is, referenced, in, the, brahma, sutras, and, numerous, scholars, wrote, commentaries, on, it, including, shankara, bhaskara, abhinavagupta, ramanuja, and, madhvacharya, many, of, these, commentators, state, that, the, gita, is, meant, to, be, a, moksa, shastra, moksasatra, and, not, a,

popular, among, the, laity, that, the, text, has, been, studied, and, commented, upon, by, earlier, scholars, these, texts, have, not, survived, but, that, i, have, found, that, to, the, laity, it, appears, to, teach, diverse, and, quite, contradictory, doctrines, he, calls, the, gita, an, epitome, of, the, essentials, of, the, whole, vedic, teaching, to, shankara, the, teaching, of, the, gita, is, to, shift, an, individual, s, focus, from, the, outer, impermanent, fleeting, objects, of, desire, and, senses, to, the, inner, permanent, eternal, atman, brahman, vasudeva, that, is, identical,

in, the, shaiva, advaita, monism, tradition, quite, similar, to, adi, shankara, but, with, the, difference, that, he, considers, both, self, and, matter, to, be, metaphysically, real, and, eternal,
