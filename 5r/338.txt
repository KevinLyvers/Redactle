made, sacrifices, each, from, his, own, fields, to, god, god, had, regard, for, abel, s, offering, but, had, no, regard, for, cain, s, cain, killed, abel, and, god, cursed, cain, sentencing, him, to, a, life, of, transience, cain, then, dwelt, in, the, land, of, nod, wandering, where, he, built, a, city, and, fathered, the, line, of, descendants, beginning, with, enoch, in, the, qur, an, cain, and, abel, are, known, as, q, b, l, arabic, and, h, b, l, respectively, the, events, of, the, story, in, the, qur, an, are, virtually, the, same, as, the, hebrew, bible, narrative, both, brothers, were, asked, to, offer, individual, sacrifices, to, god, god, accepted, abel, s, sacrifice, and, rejected, cain, s, out, of, jealousy, cain, slew, abel, the, first, ever, case, of, murder, committed, upon, the, earth, in, islam, the, story, of, cain, and, abel, serves, as, an, admonition, against, murder, and, promotes, the, sanctity, of, human, life, the, story, of, cain, s, murder, of, abel, and, its, consequences, is, told, in, genesis, 4, 1, 18, now, the, man, knew, his, wife, eve, and, she, conceived, and, bore, cain, saying, i, have, produced, a, man, with, the, help, of, the, lord, next, she, bore, his, brother, abel, now, abel, was, a, keeper, of, sheep, and, cain, a, tiller, of, the, ground, in, the, course, of, time, cain, brought, to, the, lord, an, offering, of, the, fruit, of, the, ground, and, abel, for, his, part, brought, of, the, firstlings, of, his, flock, their, fat, portions, and, the, lord, had, regard, for, abel, and, his, offering, but, for, cain, and, his, offering, he, had, no, regard, so, cain, was, very, angry, and, his, countenance, fell, the, lord, said, to, cain, why, are, you, angry, and, why, has, your, countenance, fallen, if, you, do, well, will, you, not, be, accepted, and, if, you, do, not, do, well, sin, is, lurking, at, the, door, its, desire, is, for, you, but, you, must, master, it, cain, said, to, his, brother, abel, let, us, go, out, to, the, field, and, when, they, were, in, the, field, cain, rose, up, against, his, brother, abel, and, killed, him, then, the, lord, said, to, cain, where, is, your, brother, abel, he, said, i, do, not, know, am, i, my, brother, s, keeper, and, the, lord, said, what, have, you, done, listen, your, brother, s, blood, is, crying, out, to, me, from, the, ground, and, now, you, are, cursed, from, the, ground, which, has, opened, its, mouth, to, receive, your, brother, s, blood, from, your, hand, when, you, till, the, ground, it, will, no, longer, yield, to, you, its, strength, you, will, be, a, fugitive, and, a, wanderer, on, the, earth, cain, said, to, the, lord, my, punishment, is, greater, than, i, can, bear, today, you, have, driven, me, away, from, the, soil, and, i, shall, be, hidden, from, your, face, i, shall, be, a, fugitive, and, a, wanderer, on, the, earth, and, anyone, who, meets, me, may, kill, me, then, the, lord, said, to, him, not, so, whoever, kills, cain, will, suffer, a, sevenfold, vengeance, and, the, lord, put, a, mark, on, cain, so, that, no, one, who, came, upon, him, would, kill, him, then, cain, went, away, from, the, presence, of, the, lord, and, settled, in, the, land, of, nod, east, of, eden, cain, knew, his, wife, and, she, conceived, and, bore, enoch, and, he, built, a, city, and, named, it, enoch, after, his, son, enoch, cain, and, abel, are, traditional, english, renderings, of, the, hebrew, names, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, etymology, of, their, names, may, be, a, direct, pun, on, the, roles, they, take, in, the, genesis, narrative, abel, hbl, is, thought, to, derive, from, a, reconstructed, word, meaning, herdsman, with, the, modern, arabic, cognate, ibil, now, specifically, referring, only, to, camels, cain, qyn, is, thought, to, be, cognate, to, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bce, south, arabian, word, qyn, meaning, metalsmith, this, theory, would, make, the, names, descriptive, of, their, roles, where, abel, works, with, livestock, and, cain, with, agriculture, and, would, parallel, the, names, adam, dm, man, and, eve, wh, life, giver, the, story, has, interpretations, abel, the, first, murder, victim, is, sometimes, seen, as, the, first, martyr, while, cain, the, first, murderer, is, sometimes, seen, as, an, ancestor, of, evil, some, scholars, suggest, the, pericope, may, have, been, based, on, a, sumerian, story, representing, the, conflict, between, nomadic, shepherds, and, settled, farmers, modern, scholars, typically, view, the, stories, of, adam, and, eve, and, cain, and, abel, to, be, about, the, development, of, civilization, during, the, age, of, agriculture, not, the, beginnings, of, man, but, when, people, first, learned, agriculture, replacing, the, ways, of, the, hunter, gatherer, it, has, also, been, seen, as, a, depiction, of, nomadic, conflict, the, struggle, for, land, and, resources, and, divine, favour, between, nomadic, herders, and, sedentary, farmers, the, academic, theologian, joseph, blenkinsopp, holds, that, cain, and, abel, are, symbolic, rather, than, real, like, almost, all, of, the, persons, places, and, stories, in, the, primeval, history, the, first, eleven, chapters, of, genesis, they, are, mentioned, nowhere, else, in, the, hebrew, bible, a, fact, that, for, some, scholars, suggests, that, the, history, is, a, late, composition, attached, to, genesis, to, serve, as, an, introduction, the, date, is, also, disputed, the, history, may, be, as, late, as, the, hellenistic, period, first, decades, of, the, 4th, century, bce, or, as, early, as, the, 9th, 8th, centuries, bce, but, the, high, level, of, babylonian, myth, behind, its, stories, has, led, others, to, date, it, to, the, babylonian, exile, 6th, century, bce, a, prominent, mesopotamian, parallel, to, cain, and, abel, is, enlil, chooses, the, farmer, god, in, which, the, shepherd, god, emesh, and, the, farmer, god, enten, bring, their, dispute, over, which, of, them, is, better, to, the, chief, god, enlil, who, rules, in, favor, of, enten, the, farmer, the, author, of, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, in, hebrews, 11, 4, makes, a, brief, reference, to, the, cain, and, abel, story, by, faith, abel, offered, to, god, a, more, acceptable, sacrifice, than, cain, s, through, this, he, received, approval, as, righteous, god, himself, giving, approval, to, his, gifts, he, died, but, through, his, faith, he, still, speaks, the, story, of, cain, and, abel, appears, in, the, quran, 5, 27, 31, tell, them, the, truth, about, the, story, of, adam, s, two, sons, each, of, them, offered, a, sacrifice, and, it, was, accepted, from, one, and, not, the, other, one, said, i, will, kill, you, but, the, other, said, god, only, accepts, the, sacrifice, of, those, who, are, mindful, of, him, if, you, raise, your, hand, to, kill, me, i, will, not, raise, mine, to, kill, you, i, fear, god, the, lord, of, all, worlds, and, i, would, rather, you, were, burdened, with, my, sins, as, well, as, yours, and, became, an, inhabitant, of, the, fire, such, is, the, evildoers, reward, but, his, soul, prompted, him, to, kill, his, brother, he, killed, him, and, became, one, of, the, losers, god, sent, a, raven, to, scratch, up, the, ground, and, show, him, how, to, cover, his, brother, s, corpse, and, he, said, woe, is, me, could, i, not, have, been, like, this, raven, and, covered, up, my, brother, s, body, he, became, remorseful, the, story, of, cain, and, abel, has, always, been, used, as, a, deterrent, from, murder, in, islamic, tradition, abdullah, ibn, mas, ud, reported, that, muhammad, said, in, a, hadith, no, soul, is, wrongfully, killed, except, that, some, of, the, burden, falls, upon, the, son, of, adam, for, he, was, the, first, to, establish, the, practice, of, murder, muslim, scholars, were, divided, on, the, motive, for, cain, s, murder, of, abel, and, why, the, brothers, were, obliged, to, offer, sacrifices, to, god, some, scholars, believed, that, cain, s, motives, were, jealousy, and, lust, both, cain, and, abel, desired, to, marry, their, sister, adam, s, beautiful, daughter, aclima, arabic, aqlimia, seeking, to, end, the, dispute, adam, suggested, that, each, present, an, offering, to, god, the, one, whose, offering, god, accepted, would, marry, aclima, abel, a, generous, shepherd, offered, the, fattest, of, his, sheep, as, an, oblation, to, god, but, cain, a, miserly, farmer, offered, only, a, bunch, of, grass, and, some, worthless, seeds, god, accepted, abel, s, offering, and, rejected, cain, s, an, indication, that, abel, was, more, righteous, than, cain, and, thus, worthier, of, aclima, as, a, result, it, was, decided, that, abel, would, marry, aclima, cain, would, marry, her, less, beautiful, sister, blinded, by, anger, and, lust, for, aclima, cain, sought, to, get, revenge, on, abel, and, escape, with, aclima, according, to, another, tradition, the, devil, appeared, to, cain, and, instructed, him, how, to, exact, revenge, on, abel, hit, abel, s, head, with, a, stone, and, kill, him, whispered, the, devil, to, cain, after, the, murder, the, devil, hurried, to, eve, shouting, eve, cain, has, murdered, abel, eve, did, not, know, what, murder, was, or, how, death, felt, she, asked, bewildered, and, horrified, woe, to, you, what, is, murder, he, does, not, eat, he, does, not, drink, he, does, not, move, answered, the, devil, eve, burst, into, tears, and, started, to, wail, madly, she, ran, to, adam, and, tried, to, tell, him, what, happened, however, she, could, not, speak, because, she, could, not, stop, wailing, since, then, women, wail, broken, heartedly, when, a, loved, one, dies, a, different, tradition, narrates, that, while, cain, was, quarreling, with, abel, the, devil, killed, an, animal, with, a, stone, in, cain, s, sight, to, show, him, how, to, murder, abel, after, burying, abel, and, escaping, from, his, family, cain, married, and, had, children, they, died, in, noah, s, flood, among, tyrants, and, unbelievers, some, muslim, scholars, puzzled, over, the, mention, of, offerings, in, the, narrative, of, cain, and, abel, offerings, and, sacrifices, were, ordained, only, after, the, revelation, of, tawrat, to, moses, in, islam, this, suggested, to, some, scholars, such, as, sa, id, ibn, al, musayyib, that, the, sons, of, adam, as, mentioned, in, the, quran, are, actually, two, israelites, not, cain, and, abel, in, the, apocryphon, of, john, a, work, used, in, gnosticism, cain, and, abel, are, archons, being, the, offspring, of, the, lesser, god, or, demiurge, called, yaldabaoth, placed, over, the, elements, of, fire, wind, water, and, earth, in, this, narrative, their, true, names, are, yahweh, and, elohim, but, they, are, given, their, earthly, names, as, a, form, of, deception, allusions, to, cain, and, abel, as, an, archetype, of, fratricide, appear, in, numerous, references, and, retellings, through, medieval, art, and, shakespearean, works, up, to, present, day, fiction, the, serpent, seed, explanation, for, cain, being, capable, of, murder, is, that, he, may, have, been, the, offspring, of, a, fallen, angel, or, satan, himself, rather, than, being, from, adam, a, treatise, on, christian, hermeticism, meditations, on, the, tarot, a, journey, into, christian, hermeticism, describes, the, biblical, account, of, cain, and, abel, as, a, myth, in, that, it, expresses, in, a, form, narrated, for, a, particular, case, an, eternal, idea, it, argues, that, brothers, can, become, mortal, enemies, through, the, very, fact, that, they, worship, the, same, god, in, the, same, way, according, to, the, author, the, source, of, religious, wars, is, revealed, it, is, not, the, difference, in, dogma, or, ritual, which, is, the, cause, but, the, pretention, to, equality, or, the, negation, of, hierarchy, there, were, other, minor, traditions, concerning, cain, and, abel, of, both, older, and, newer, date, the, apocryphal, life, of, adam, and, eve, tells, of, eve, having, a, dream, in, which, cain, drank, his, brother, s, blood, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, the, prophecy, from, happening, the, two, young, men, are, separated, and, given, different, jobs, like, other, prominent, biblical, figures, cain, and, abel, appear, in, many, works, of, art, including, works, by, titian, peter, paul, rubens, and,
