a, dragon, is, a, magical, legendary, creature, that, appears, in, the, folklore, of, multiple, cultures, worldwide, beliefs, about, dragons, vary, considerably, through, regions, but, dragons, in, western, cultures, since, the, high, middle, ages, have, often, been, depicted, as, winged, horned, and, capable, of, breathing, fire, dragons, in, eastern, cultures, are, usually, depicted, as, wingless, four, legged, serpentine, creatures, with, above, average, intelligence, commonalities, between, dragons, traits, are, often, a, hybridization, of, feline, reptilian, mammalian, and, avian, features, the, word, dragon, entered, the, english, language, in, the, early, 13th, century, from, old, french, dragon, which, in, turn, comes, from, latin, draco, genitive, draconis, meaning, huge, serpent, dragon, from, ancient, greek, dr, k, n, genitive, dr, kontos, serpent, the, greek, and, latin, term, referred, to, any, great, serpent, not, necessarily, mythological, the, greek, word, is, most, likely, derived, from, the, greek, verb, d, rkomai, meaning, i, see, the, aorist, form, of, which, is, drakon, this, is, thought, to, have, referred, to, something, with, a, deadly, glance, or, unusually, bright, or, sharp, eyes, or, because, a, snake, s, eyes, appear, to, be, always, open, each, eye, actually, sees, through, a, big, transparent, scale, in, its, eyelids, which, are, permanently, shut, the, greek, word, probably, derives, from, an, indo, european, base, der, meaning, to, see, the, sanskrit, root, dr, also, means, to, see, draconic, creatures, appear, in, virtually, all, cultures, around, the, globe, and, the, earliest, attested, reports, of, draconic, creatures, resemble, giant, snakes, draconic, creatures, are, first, described, in, the, mythologies, of, the, ancient, near, east, and, appear, in, ancient, mesopotamian, art, and, literature, stories, about, storm, gods, slaying, giant, serpents, occur, throughout, nearly, all, near, eastern, and, indo, european, mythologies, famous, prototypical, draconic, creatures, include, the, mu, u, u, of, ancient, mesopotamia, apep, in, egyptian, mythology, v, tra, in, the, rigveda, the, leviathan, in, the, hebrew, bible, grand, goule, in, the, poitou, region, in, france, python, ladon, wyvern, and, the, lernaean, hydra, in, greek, mythology, kulshedra, in, albanian, mythology, unhcegila, in, lakota, mythology, quetzalcoatl, in, aztec, culture, j, rmungandr, n, h, ggr, and, fafnir, in, norse, mythology, the, dragon, from, beowulf, and, a, i, and, az, in, ancient, persian, mythology, closely, related, to, another, mythological, figure, called, a, i, dahaka, or, zahhak, nonetheless, scholars, dispute, where, the, idea, of, a, dragon, originates, from, and, a, wide, variety, of, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, in, his, book, an, instinct, for, dragons, 2000, david, e, jones, anthropologist, suggests, a, hypothesis, that, humans, like, monkeys, have, inherited, instinctive, reactions, to, snakes, large, cats, and, birds, of, prey, he, cites, a, study, which, found, that, approximately, 39, people, in, a, hundred, are, afraid, of, snakes, and, notes, that, fear, of, snakes, is, especially, prominent, in, children, even, in, areas, where, snakes, are, rare, the, earliest, attested, dragons, all, resemble, snakes, or, have, snakelike, attributes, jones, therefore, concludes, that, dragons, appear, in, nearly, all, cultures, because, humans, have, an, innate, fear, of, snakes, and, other, animals, that, were, major, predators, of, humans, primate, ancestors, dragons, are, usually, said, to, reside, in, dark, caves, deep, pools, wild, mountain, reaches, sea, bottoms, haunted, forests, all, places, which, would, have, been, fraught, with, danger, for, early, human, ancestors, in, her, book, the, first, fossil, hunters, dinosaurs, mammoths, and, myth, in, greek, and, roman, times, 2000, adrienne, mayor, argues, that, some, stories, of, dragons, may, have, been, inspired, by, ancient, discoveries, of, fossils, belonging, to, dinosaurs, and, other, prehistoric, animals, she, argues, that, the, dragon, lore, of, northern, india, may, have, been, inspired, by, observations, of, oversized, extraordinary, bones, in, the, fossilbeds, of, the, siwalik, hills, below, the, himalayas, and, that, ancient, greek, artistic, depictions, of, the, monster, of, troy, may, have, been, influenced, by, fossils, of, samotherium, an, extinct, species, of, giraffe, whose, fossils, are, common, in, the, mediterranean, region, in, china, a, region, where, fossils, of, large, prehistoric, animals, are, common, these, remains, are, frequently, identified, as, dragon, bones, and, are, commonly, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, mayor, however, is, careful, to, point, out, that, not, all, stories, of, dragons, and, giants, are, inspired, by, fossils, and, notes, that, scandinavia, has, many, stories, of, dragons, and, sea, monsters, but, has, long, been, considered, barren, of, large, fossils, in, one, of, her, later, books, she, states, that, many, dragon, images, around, the, world, were, based, on, folk, knowledge, or, exaggerations, of, living, reptiles, such, as, komodo, dragons, gila, monsters, iguanas, alligators, or, in, california, alligator, lizards, though, this, still, fails, to, account, for, the, scandinavian, legends, as, no, such, animals, historical, or, otherwise, have, ever, been, found, in, this, region, robert, blust, in, the, origin, of, dragons, 2000, argues, that, like, many, other, creations, of, traditional, cultures, dragons, are, largely, explicable, as, products, of, a, convergence, of, rational, pre, scientific, speculation, about, the, world, of, real, events, in, this, case, the, event, is, the, natural, mechanism, governing, rainfall, and, drought, with, particular, attention, paid, to, the, phenomenon, of, the, rainbow, in, egyptian, mythology, apep, or, apophis, is, a, giant, serpentine, creature, who, resides, in, the, duat, the, egyptian, underworld, the, bremner, rhind, papyrus, written, around, 310, bc, preserves, an, account, of, a, much, older, egyptian, tradition, that, the, setting, of, the, sun, is, caused, by, ra, descending, to, the, duat, to, battle, apep, in, some, accounts, apep, is, as, long, as, the, height, of, eight, men, with, a, head, made, of, flint, thunderstorms, and, earthquakes, were, thought, to, be, caused, by, apep, s, roar, and, solar, eclipses, were, thought, to, be, the, result, of, apep, attacking, ra, during, the, daytime, in, some, myths, apep, is, slain, by, the, god, set, nehebkau, is, another, giant, serpent, who, guards, the, duat, and, aided, ra, in, his, battle, against, apep, nehebkau, was, so, massive, in, some, stories, that, the, entire, earth, was, believed, to, rest, atop, his, coils, denwen, is, a, giant, serpent, mentioned, in, the, pyramid, texts, whose, body, was, made, of, fire, and, who, ignited, a, conflagration, that, nearly, destroyed, all, the, gods, of, the, egyptian, pantheon, he, was, ultimately, defeated, by, the, pharaoh, a, victory, which, affirmed, the, pharaoh, s, divine, right, to,

according, to, the, amduat, the, oldest, surviving, book, of, the, afterlife, was, said, to, coil, around, the, corpse, of, the, sun, god, ra, protectively, the, earliest, surviving, depiction, of, a, true, ouroboros, comes, from, the, gilded, shrines, in, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, in, the, early, centuries, ad, the, ouroboros, was, adopted, as, a, symbol, by, gnostic, christians, and, chapter, 136, of, the, pistis, sophia, an, early, gnostic, text, describes, a, great, dragon, whose, tail, is, in, its, mouth, in, medieval, alchemy, the, ouroboros, became, a, typical, western, dragon, with, wings, legs, and, a, tail, a, famous, image, of, the, dragon, gnawing, on, its, tail, from, the, eleventh, century, codex, marcianus, was, copied, in, numerous, works, on, alchemy, ancient, people, across, the, near, east, believed, in, creatures, similar, to, what, modern, people, call, dragons, these, ancient, people, were, unaware, of, the, existence, of, dinosaurs, or, similar, creatures, in, the, distant, past, references, to, dragons, of, both, benevolent, and, malevolent, characters, occur, throughout, ancient, mesopotamian, literature, in, sumerian, poetry, great, kings, are,

deities, and, also, as, a, general, protective, emblem, it, seems, to, have, originally, been, the, attendant, of, the, underworld, god, ninazu, but, later, became, the, attendant, to, the, hurrian,

by, scholars, as, having, had, the, form, of, a, giant, serpent, but, several, scholars, have, pointed, out, that, this, shape, cannot, be, imputed, to, tiamat, with, certainty, and, she, seems, to, have, at, least, sometimes, been, regarded, as, anthropomorphic, nonetheless, in, some, texts, she, seems, to, be, described, with, horns, a, tail, and, a, hide, that, no, weapon, can, penetrate, all,
