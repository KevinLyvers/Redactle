al, l, t, al, uzz, and, man, t, at, local, shrines, and, temples, such, as, the, kaaba, in, mecca, deities, were, venerated, and, invoked, through, a, variety, of, rituals, including, pilgrimages, and, divination, as, well, as, ritual, sacrifice, different, theories, have, been, proposed, regarding, the, role, of, allah, in, meccan, religion, many, of, the, physical, descriptions, of, the, pre, islamic, gods, are, traced, to, idols, especially, near, the, kaaba, which, is, said, to, have, contained, up, to, 360, of, them, other, religions, were, represented, to, varying, lesser, degrees, the, influence, of, the, adjacent, roman, and, aksumite, civilizations, resulted, in, christian, communities, in, the, northwest, northeast, and, south, of, arabia, christianity, made, a, lesser, impact, in, the, remainder, of, the, peninsula, but, did, secure, some, conversions, with, the, exception, of, nestorianism, in, the, northeast, and, the, persian, gulf, the, dominant, form, of,

deities, until, about, the, fourth, century, almost, all, inhabitants, of, arabia, practiced, polytheistic, religions, at, which, point, pre, islamic, arabian, monotheism, had, begun, to, spread, from, the, fourth, to, sixth, centuries, jewish, christian, and, other, monotheistic, populations, developed, until, recent, decades, it, was, believed, that, polytheism, remained, the, dominant, belief, system, in, pre, islamic, arabia, but, recent, trends, suggest, that, henotheism, or, monotheism, was, dominant, from, the, fourth, century, onwards, the, contemporary, sources, of, information, regarding, the, pre, islamic, arabian, religion, and, pantheon, include, a, growing, number, of, inscriptions, in, carvings, written, in, arabian, scripts, like, safaitic, sabaic, and, paleo, arabic, pre, islamic, poetry, external, sources, such, as, jewish, and, greek, accounts, as, well, as, the, muslim, tradition, such, as, the, qur, an, and, islamic, writings, nevertheless, information, is, limited, one, early, attestation, of, arabian, polytheism, was, in, esarhaddon, s, annals, mentioning, atarsamain, nukhay, ruldaiu, and, atarquruma, herodotus, writing, in, his, histories, reported, that, the, arabs, worshipped, orotalt, identified, with, dionysus, and, alilat, identified, with, aphrodite, strabo, stated, the, arabs, worshipped, dionysus, and, zeus, origen, stated, they, worshipped, dionysus, and, urania, muslim, sources, regarding, arabian, polytheism, include, the, eighth, century, book, of, idols, by, hisham, ibn, al, kalbi, which, f, e, peters, argued, to, be, the, most, substantial, treatment, of, the, religious, practices, of, pre, islamic, arabia, as, well, as, the, writings, of, the, yemeni, historian, al, hasan, al, hamdani, on, south, arabian, religious, beliefs, according, to, the, book, of, idols, descendants, of, the, son, of, abraham, ishmael, who, had, settled, in, mecca, migrated, to, other, lands, carried, holy, stones, from, the, kaaba, with, them, erected, them, and, circumambulated, them, like, the, kaaba, this, according, to, al, kalbi, led, to, the, rise, of, idol, worship, based, on, this, it, may, be, probable, that, arabs, originally, venerated, stones, later, adopting, idol, worship, under, foreign, influences, the, relationship, between, a, god, and, a, stone, as, his, representation, can, be, seen, from, the, third, century, syriac, work, called, the, homily, of, pseudo, meliton, where, he, describes, the, pagan, faiths, of, syriac, speakers, in, northern, mesopotamia, who, were, mostly, arabs, however, mythologies, and, narratives, elucidating, the, history, of, these, gods, as, well, as, the, meaning, of, their, epithets, remains, uninformative, the, pre, islamic, arabian, religions, were, polytheistic, with, many, of, the, deities, names, known, formal, pantheons, are, more, noticeable, at, the, level, of, kingdoms, of, variable, sizes, ranging, from, simple, city, states, to, collections, of, tribes, tribes, towns, clans, lineages, and, families, had, their, own, cults, too, christian, julien, robin, suggests, that, this, structure, of, the, divine, world, reflected, the, society, of, the, time, trade, caravans, also, brought, foreign, religious, and, cultural, influences, a, large, number, of, deities, did, not, have, proper, names, and, were, referred, to, by, titles, indicating, a, quality, a, family, relationship, or, a, locale, preceded, by, he, who, or, she, who, dh, or, dh, t, respectively, the, religious, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, nomadic, bedouin, were, distinct, from, those, of, the, settled, tribes, of, towns, such, as, mecca, nomadic, religious, belief, systems, and, practices, are, believed, to, have, included, fetishism, totemism, and, veneration, of, the, dead, but, were, connected, principally, with, immediate, concerns, and, problems, and, did, not, consider, larger, philosophical, questions, such, as, the, afterlife, settled, urban, arabs, on, the, other, hand, are, thought, to, have, believed, in, a, more, complex, pantheon, of, deities, while, the, meccans, and, the, other, settled, inhabitants, of, the, hejaz, worshiped, their, gods, at, permanent, shrines, in, towns, and, oases, the, bedouin, practiced, their, religion, on, the, move, in, south, arabia, mndh, t, were, anonymous, guardian, spirits, of, the, community, and, the, ancestor, spirits, of, the, family, they, were, known, as, the, sun, shms, of, their, ancestors, in, north, arabia, ginnaye, were, known, from, palmyrene, inscriptions, as, the, good, and, rewarding, gods, and, were, probably, related, to, the, jinn, of, west, and, central, arabia, unlike, jinn, ginnaye, could, not, hurt, nor, possess, humans, and, were, much, more, similar, to, the, roman, genius, according, to, common, arabian, belief, soothsayers, pre, islamic, philosophers, and, poets, were, inspired, by, the, jinn, however, jinn, were, also, feared, and, thought, to, be, responsible, for, causing, various, diseases, and, mental, illnesses, aside, from, benevolent, gods, and, spirits, there, existed, malevolent, beings, these, beings, were, not, attested, in, the, epigraphic, record, but, were, alluded, to, in, pre, islamic, arabic, poetry, and, their, legends, were, collected, by, later, muslim, authors, commonly, mentioned, are, ghouls, etymologically, the, english, word, ghoul, was, derived, from, the, arabic, ghul, from, ghala, to, seize, related, to, the, sumerian, galla, they, are, said, to, have, a, hideous, appearance, with, feet, like, those, of, an, ass, arabs, were, said, to, utter, the, following, couplet, if, they, should, encounter, one, oh, ass, footed, one, just, bray, away, we, won, t, leave, the, desert, plain, nor, ever, go, astray, christian, julien, robin, notes, that, all, the, known, south, arabian, divinities, had, a, positive, or, protective, role, and, that, evil, powers, were, only, alluded, to, but, were, never, personified, some, scholars, postulate, that, in, pre, islamic, arabia, including, in, mecca, allah, was, considered, to, be, a, deity, possibly, a, creator, deity, or, a, supreme, deity, in, a, polytheistic, pantheon, the, word, allah, from, the, arabic, al, ilah, meaning, the, god, may, have, been, used, as, a, title, rather, than, a, name, the, concept, of, allah, may, have, been, vague, in, the, meccan, religion, according, to, islamic, sources, meccans, and, their, neighbors, believed, that, the, goddesses, al, l, t, al, uzz, and, man, t, were, the, daughters, of, allah, regional, variants, of, the, word, allah, occur, in, both, pagan, and, christian, pre, islamic, inscriptions, references, to, allah, are, found, in, the, poetry, of, the, pre, islamic, arab, poet, zuhayr, bin, abi, sulma, who, lived, a, generation, before, muhammad, as, well, as, pre, islamic, personal, names, muhammad, s, father, s, name, was, abd, all, h, meaning, the, servant, of, allah, charles, russell, coulter, and, patricia, turner, considered, that, allah, s, name, may, be, derived, from, a, pre, islamic, god, called, ailiah, and, is, similar, to, el, il, ilah, and, jehovah, they, also, considered, some, of, his, characteristics, to, be, seemingly, based, on, lunar, deities, like, almaqah, kahl, shaker, wadd, and, warakh, alfred, guillaume, states, that, the, connection, between, ilah, that, came, to, form, allah, and, ancient, babylonian, il, or, el, of, ancient, israel, is, not, clear, wellhausen, states, that, allah, was, known, from, jewish, and, christian, sources, and, was, known, to, pagan, arabs, as, the, supreme, god, winfried, corduan, doubts, the, theory, of, allah, of, islam, being, linked, to, a, moon, god, stating, that, the, term, allah, functions, as, a, generic, term, like, the, term, el, elyon, used, as, a, title, for, the, god, sin, south, arabian, inscriptions, from, the, fourth, century, ad, refer, to, a, god, called, rahman, the, merciful, one, who, had, a, monotheistic, cult, and, was, referred, to, as, the, lord, of, heaven, and, earth, aaron, w, hughes, states, that, scholars, are, unsure, whether, he, developed, from, the, earlier, polytheistic, systems, or, developed, due, to, the, increasing, significance, of, the, christian, and, jewish, communities, and, that, it, is, difficult, to, establish, whether, allah, was, linked, to, rahman, maxime, rodinson, however, considers, one, of, allah, s, names, ar, rahman, to, have, been, used, in, the, form, of, rahmanan, earlier, al, l, t, al, uzz, and, man, t, were, common, names, used, for, multiple, goddesses, across, arabia, g, r, hawting, states, that, modern, scholars, have, frequently, associated, the, names, of, arabian, goddesses, al, l, t, al, uzz, and, man, t, with, cults, devoted, to, celestial, bodies, particularly, venus, drawing, upon, evidence, external, to, the, muslim, tradition, as, well, as, in, relation, to, syria, mesopotamia, and, the, sinai, peninsula, all, t, arabic, or, al, l, t, was, worshipped, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, with, various, associations, herodotus, in, the, 5th, century, bc, identifies, alilat, greek, as, the, arabic, name, for, aphrodite, and, in, another, passage, for, urania, which, is, strong, evidence, for, worship, of, all, t, in, arabia, at, that, early, date, al, uzz, arabic, was, a, fertility, goddess, or, possibly, a, goddess, of, love, man, t, arabic, was, the, goddess, of, destiny, al, l, t, s, cult, was, spread, in, syria, and, northern, arabia, from, safaitic, and, hismaic, inscriptions, it, is, probable, that, she, was, worshiped, as, lat, lt, f, v, winnet, saw, al, lat, as, a, lunar, deity, due, to, the, association, of, a, crescent, with, her, in, ayn, esh, shall, leh, and, a, lihyanite, inscription, mentioning, the, name, of, wadd, the, minaean, moon, god, over, the, title, of, fkl, lt, ren, dussaud, and, gonzague, ryckmans, linked, her, with, venus, while, others, have, thought, her, to, be, a, solar, deity, john, f, healey, considers, that, al, uzza, actually, might, have, been, an, epithet, of, al, l, t, before, becoming, a, separate, deity, in, the, meccan, pantheon, paola, corrente, writing, in, redefining, dionysus, considers, she, might, have, been, a, god, of, vegetation, or, a, celestial, deity, of, atmospheric, phenomena, and, a, sky, deity, the, worship, of, sacred, stones, constituted, one, of, the, most, important, practices, of, the, semitic, speaking, peoples, including, arabs, cult, images, of, a, deity, were, most, often, an, unworked, stone, block, the, most, common, name, for, these, stone, blocks, was, derived, from, the, semitic, nsb, to, be, stood, upright, but, other, names, were, used, such, as, nabataean, masgida, place, of, prostration, and, arabic, duwar, object, of, circumambulation, this, term, often, occurs, in, pre, islamic, arabic, poetry, these, god, stones, were, usually, a, free, standing, slab, but, nabataean, god, stones, are, usually, carved, directly, on, the, rock, face, facial, features, may, be, incised, on, the, stone, especially, in, nabataea, or, astral, symbols, especially, in, south, arabia, under, greco, roman, influence, an, anthropomorphic, statue, might, be, used, instead, the, book, of, idols, describes, two, types, of, statues, idols, sanam, and, images, wathan, if, a, statue, were, made, of, wood, gold, or, silver, after, a, human, form, it, would, be, an, idol, but, if, the, statue, were, made, of, stone, it, would, be, an, image, representation, of, deities, in, animal, form, was, common, in, south, arabia, such, as, the, god, sayin, from, hadhramaut, who, was, represented, as, either, an, eagle, fighting, a, serpent, or, a, bull, sacred, places, were, known, as, hima, haram, or, mahram, and, within, these, places, all, living, things, were, considered, inviolable, and, violence, was, forbidden, in, most, of, arabia,

belief, in, fatalism, adar, alongside, a, fearful, consideration, for, the, sky, and, the, stars, which, they, held, to, be, ultimately, responsible, for, every, phenomena, that, occurs, on, earth,

probably, not, allowed, the, victim, s, blood, according, to, pre, islamic, arabic, poetry, and, certain, south, arabian, inscriptions, was, also, poured, out, on, the, altar, stone, thus, forming, a, bond, between, the, human, and, the, deity, according, to, muslim, sources, most, sacrifices, were, concluded, with, communal, feasts, in, south, arabia, beginning, with, the, christian, era, or, perhaps, a, short, while, before, statuettes, were, presented, before, the, deity, known, as, slm, male, or, slmt, female, human, sacrifice, was, sometimes, carried, out, in, arabia, the, victims, were, generally, prisoners, of, war, who, represented, the, god, s, part, of, the, victory, in, booty, although, other, forms, might, have, existed, blood, sacrifice, was, definitely, practiced, in, south, arabia, but, few, allusions, to, the, practice, are, known, apart, from, some, minaean, inscriptions, pre, islamic, arabia, practiced, various, forms, of, polytheistic, religion, until, the, 4th, century, when, monotheism, was, introduced, into, the, region, and, became, largely, prevalent, by, the, 6th, century, as, is, attested, in, texts, like, the, inscriptions, from, jabal, dabub, ri, al, zallalah, and, the, abd, shams, inscription, in, the, hejaz, menstruating, women, were, not, allowed, to, be, near, the, cult, images, the, area, where, isaf, and, na, ila, s, images, stood, was, considered, out, of, bounds, for, menstruating, women, this, was, reportedly, the, same, with, manaf, according, to, the, book, of, idols, this, rule, applied, to, all, the, idols, this, was, also, the, case, in, south, arabia, as, attested, in, a, south, arabian, inscription, from, al, jawf, sexual, intercourse, in, temples, was, prohibited, as, attested, in, two, south, arabian, inscriptions, one, legend, concerning, isaf, and, na, ila, when, two, lovers, made, love, in, the, kaaba, and, were, petrified, joining, the, idols, in, the, kaaba, echoes, this, prohibition, the, dilmun, civilization, which, existed, along, the, persian, gulf, coast, and, bahrain, until, the, 6th, century, bc, worshipped, a, pair, of, deities, inzak, and, meskilak, it, is, not, known, whether, these, were, the, only, deities, in, the, pantheon, or, whether, there, were, others, the, discovery, of, wells, at, the, sites, of, a, dilmun, temple, and, a, shrine, suggests, that, sweet, water, played, an, important, part, in, religious, practices, in, the, subsequent, greco, roman, period, there, is, evidence, that, the, worship, of, non, indigenous, deities, was, brought, to, the, region, by, merchants, and, visitors, these, included, bel, a, god, popular, in, the, syrian, city, of, palmyra, the, mesopotamian, deities, nabu, and, shamash, the, greek, deities, poseidon, and, artemis, and, the, west, arabian, deities, kahl, and, manat, the, main, sources, of, religious, information, in, pre, islamic, south, arabia, are, inscriptions, which, number, in, the, thousands, as, well, as, the, quran, complemented, by, archaeological, evidence, the, civilizations, of, south, arabia, are, considered, to, have, the, most, developed, pantheon, in, the, arabian, peninsula, in, south, arabia, the, most, common, god, was, athtar, who, was, considered, remote, the, patron, deity, shym, was, considered, to, be, of, much, more, immediate, significance, than, athtar, thus, the, kingdom, of, saba, had, almaqah, the, kingdom, of, ma, in, had, wadd, the, kingdom, of, qataban, had, amm, and, the, kingdom, of, hadhramaut, had, sayin, each, people, was, termed, the, children, of, their, respective, patron, deity, patron, deities, played, a, vital, role, in, sociopolitical, terms, their, cults, serving, as, the, focus, of, a, person, s, cohesion, and, loyalty, evidence, from, surviving, inscriptions, suggests, that, each, of, the, southern, kingdoms, had, its, own, pantheon, of, three, to, five, deities, the, major, deity, always, being, a, god, for, example, the, pantheon, of, saba, comprised, almaqah, the, major, deity, together, with, athtar, haubas, dhat, himyam, and, dhat, badan, the, main, god, in, ma, in, and, himyar, was, athtar, in, qataban, it, was, amm, and, in, hadhramaut, it, was, sayin, amm, was, a, lunar, deity, and, was, associated, with, the, weather, especially, lightning, one, of, the, most, frequent, titles, of, the, god, almaqah, was,

majority, of, extant, information, about, mecca, during, the, rise, of, islam, and, earlier, times, comes, from, the, text, of, the, quran, itself, and, later, muslim, sources, such, as, the, prophetic, biography, literature, dealing, with, the, life, of, muhammad, and, the, book, of, idols, alternative, sources, are, so, fragmentary, and, specialized, that, writing, a, convincing, history, of, this, period, based, on, them, alone, is, impossible, several, scholars, hold, that, the, s, ra, literature, is, not, independent, of, the, quran, but, has, been, fabricated, to, explain, the, verses, of, the, quran, there, is, evidence, to, support, the, contention, that, some, reports, of, the, s, ras, are, of, dubious, validity, but, there, is, also, evidence, to, support, the, contention, that, the, s, ra, narratives, originated, independently, of, the, quran, compounding, the, problem, is, that, the, earliest, extant, muslim, historical, works, including, the, s, ras, were, composed, in, their, definitive, form, more, than, a, century, after, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, era, some, of, these, works, were, based, on, subsequently, lost, earlier, texts, which, in, their, turn, recorded, a, fluid, oral, tradition, scholars, do, not, agree, as, to, the, time, when, such, oral, accounts, began, to, be, systematically, collected, and, written, down, and, they, differ, greatly, in, their, assessment, of, the, historical, reliability, of, the, available, texts, the, kaaba, whose, environs, were, regarded, as, sacred, haram, became, a, national, shrine, under, the, custodianship, of, the, quraysh, the, chief, tribe, of, mecca, which, made, the, hejaz, the, most, important, religious, area, in, north, arabia, its, role, was, solidified, by, a, confrontation, with, the, christian, king, abraha, who, controlled, much, of, arabia, from, a, seat, of, power, in, yemen, in, the, middle, of, the, sixth, century, abraha, had, recently, constructed, a, splendid, church, in, sana, a, and, he, wanted, to, make, that, city, a, major, center, of, pilgrimage, but, mecca, s, kaaba, presented, a, challenge, to, his, plan, abraha, found, a, pretext, for, an, attack, on, mecca, presented, by, different, sources, alternatively, as, pollution, of, the, church, by, a, tribe, allied, to, the, meccans, or, as, an, attack, on, abraha, s, grandson, in, najran, by, a, meccan, party, the, defeat, of, the, army, he, assembled, to, conquer, mecca, is, recounted, in, detail, by, the, islamic, tradition, and, is, also, alluded, to, in, the, quran, and, pre, islamic, poetry, after, the, battle, which, probably, occurred, around, 565, the, quraysh, became, a, dominant, force, in, western, arabia, receiving, the, title, god, s, people, ahl, allah, according, to, islamic, sources, and, formed, the, cult, association, of, ums, which, tied, members, of, many, tribes, in, western, arabia, to, the, kaaba, according, to, tradition, the, kaaba, was, a, cube, like, originally, roofless, structure, housing, a, black, stone, revered, as, a, relic, the, sanctuary, was, dedicated, to, hubal, arabic, who, according, to, some, sources, was, worshiped, as, the, greatest, of, the, 360, idols, the, kaaba, contained, which, probably, represented, the, days, of, the, year, ibn, ishaq, and, ibn, al, kalbi, both, report, that, the, human, shaped, idol, of, hubal, made, of, precious, stone, agate, according, to, the, book, of, idols, came, into, the, possession, of, the, quraysh, with, its, right, hand, broken, off, and, that, the, quraysh, made, a, hand, of, gold, to, replace, it, a, soothsayer, performed, divination, in, the, shrine, by, drawing, ritual, arrows, and, vows, and, sacrifices, were, made, to, assure, success, marshall, hodgson, argues, that, relations, with, deities, and, fetishes, in, pre, islamic, mecca, were, maintained, chiefly, on, the, basis, of, bargaining, where, favors, were, expected, in, return, for, offerings, a, deity, s, or, oracle, s, failure, to, provide, the, desired, response, was, sometimes, met, with, anger, different, theories, have, been, proposed, regarding, the, role, of, allah, in, meccan, religion, according, to, one, hypothesis, which, goes, back, to, julius, wellhausen, allah, the, supreme, deity, of, the, tribal, federation, around, quraysh, was, a, designation, that, consecrated, the, superiority, of, hubal, the, supreme, deity, of, quraysh, over, the, other, gods, however, there, is, also, evidence, that, allah, and, hubal, were, two, distinct, deities, according, to, that, hypothesis, the, kaaba, was, first, consecrated, to, a, supreme, deity, named, allah, and, then, hosted, the, pantheon, of, quraysh, after, their, conquest, of, mecca, about, a, century, before, the, time, of, muhammad, some, inscriptions, seem, to, indicate, the, use, of, allah, as, a, name, of, a, polytheist, deity, centuries, earlier, but, we, know, nothing, precise, about, this, use, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, allah, may, have, represented, a, remote, creator, god, who, was, gradually, eclipsed, by, more, particularized, local, deities, there, is, disagreement, on, whether, allah, played, a, major, role, in, the, meccan, religious, cult, no, iconic, representation, or, idol, of, allah, is, known, to, have, existed, the, three, chief, goddesses, of, meccan, religion, were, al, lat, al, uzz, and, man, t, who, were, called, the, daughters, of, allah, egerton, sykes, meanwhile, states, that, al, l, t, was, the, female, counterpart, of, allah, while, uzza, was, a, name, given, by, banu, ghatafan, to, the, planet, venus, other, deities, of, the, quraysh, in, mecca, included, manaf, isaf, and, na, ila, although, the, early, arab, historian, al, tabari, calls, manaf, arabic, one, of, the, greatest, deities, of, mecca, very, little, information, is, available, about, it, women, touched, his, idol, as, a, token, of, blessing, and, kept, away, from, it, during, menstruation, gonzague, ryckmans, described, this, as, a, practice, peculiar, to, manaf, but, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, islam, a, report, from, ibn, al, kalbi, indicates, that, it, was, common, to, all, idols, muhammad, s, great, great, grandfather, s, name, was, abd, manaf, which, means, slave, of, manaf, he, is, thought, by, some, scholars, to, be, a, sun, god, the, idols, of, is, f, and, n, ila, were, located, near, the, black, stone, with, a, talbiyah, performed, to, is, f, during, sacrifices, various, legends, existed, about, the, idols, including, one, that, they, were, petrified, after, they, committed, adultery, in, the, kaaba, the, pantheon, of, the, quraysh, was, not, identical, with, that, of, the, tribes, who, entered, into, various, cult, and, commercial, associations, with, them, especially, that, of, the, hums, christian, julien, robin, argues, that, the, former, was, composed, principally, of, idols, that, were, in, the, sanctuary, of, mecca, including, hubal, and, manaf, while, the, pantheon, of, the, associations, was, superimposed, on, it, and, its, principal, deities, included, the, three, goddesses, who, had, neither, idols, nor, a, shrine, in, that, city, the, second, half, of, the, sixth, century, was, a, period, of, political, disorder, in, arabia, and, communication, routes, were, no, longer, secure, religious, divisions, were, an, important, cause, of, the, crisis, judaism, became, the, dominant, religion, in, yemen, while, christianity, took, root, in, the, persian, gulf, area, in, line, with, the, broader, trends, of, the, ancient, world, arabia, yearned, for, a, more, spiritual, form, of, religion, and, began, believing, in, afterlife, while, the, choice, of, religion, increasingly, became, a, personal, rather, than, communal, choice, while, many, were, reluctant, to, convert, to, a, foreign, faith, those, faiths, provided, intellectual, and, spiritual, reference, points, and, the, old, pagan, vocabulary, of, arabic, began, to, be, replaced, by, jewish, and, christian, loanwords, from, aramaic, everywhere, including, mecca, the, distribution, of, pagan, temples, supports, gerald, hawting, s, argument, that, arabian, polytheism, was, marginalized, in, the, region, and, already, dying, in, mecca, on, the, eve, of, islam, the, practice, of, polytheistic, cults, was, increasingly, limited, to, the, steppe, and, the, desert, and, in, yathrib, later, known, as, medina, which, included, two, tribes, with, polytheistic, majorities, the, absence, of, a, public, pagan, temple, in, the, town, or, its, immediate, neighborhood, indicates, that, polytheism, was, confined, to, the, private, sphere, looking, at, the, text, of, the, quran, itself, hawting, has, also, argued, that, the, criticism, of, idolaters, and, polytheists, contained, in, quran, is, in, fact, a, hyperbolic, reference, to, other, monotheists, in, particular, the, arab, jews, and, arab, christians, whose, religious, beliefs, were, considered, imperfect, according, to, some, traditions, the, kaaba, contained, no, statues, but, its, interior, was, decorated, with, images, of, mary, and, jesus, prophets, angels, and, trees, to, counter, the, effects, of, anarchy, the, institution, of, sacred, months, during, which, every, act, of, violence, was, prohibited, was, reestablished, during, those, months, it, was, possible, to, participate, in, pilgrimages, and, fairs, without, danger, the, quraysh, upheld, the, principle, of, two, annual, truces, one, of, one, month, and, the, second, of, three, months, which, conferred, a, sacred, character, to, the, meccan, sanctuary, the, cult, association, of, hums, in, which, individuals, and, groups, partook, in, the, same, rites, was, primarily, religious, but, it, also, had, important, economic, consequences, although, as, patricia, crone, has, shown, mecca, could, not, compare, with, the, great, centers, of, caravan, trade, on, the, eve, of, islam, it, was, probably, one, of, the, most, prosperous, and, secure, cities, of, the, peninsula, since, unlike, many, of, them, it, did, not, have, surrounding, walls, pilgrimage, to, mecca, was, a, popular, custom, some, islamic, rituals, including, processions, around, the, kaaba, and, between, the, hills, of, al, safa, and, marwa, as, well, as, the, salutation, we, are, here, o, allah, we, are, here, repeated, on, approaching, the, kaaba, are, believed, to, have, antedated, islam, spring, water, acquired, a, sacred, character, in, arabia, early, on, and, islamic, sources, state, that, the, well, of, zamzam, became, holy, long, before, the, islamic, era, according, to, ibn, sa, d, the, opposition, in, mecca, started, when, the, prophet, of, islam, muhammad, delivered, verses, that, spoke, shamefully, of, the, idols, they, the, meccans, worshiped, other, than, himself, god, and, mentioned, the, perdition, of, their, fathers, who, died, in, disbelief, according, to, william, montgomery, watt, as, the, ranks, of, muhammad, s, followers, swelled, he, became, a, threat, to, the, local, tribes, and, the, rulers, of, the, city, whose, wealth, rested, upon, the, kaaba, the, focal, point, of, meccan, religious, life, which, muhammad, threatened, to, overthrow, muhammad, s, denunciation, of, the, meccan, traditional, religion, was, especially, offensive, to, his, own, tribe, the, quraysh, as, they, were, the, guardians, of, the, kaaba, the, conquest, of, mecca, around, 629, 630, ad, led, to, the, destruction, of, the, idols, around, the, kaaba, including, hubal, following, the, conquest, shrines, and, temples, dedicated, to, deities, were, destroyed, such, as, the, shrines, to, al, lat, al, uzza, and, manat, in, ta, if, nakhla, and, al, qudayd, respectively, less, complex, societies, outside, south, arabia, often, had, smaller, pantheons, with, the, patron, deity, having, much, prominence, the, deities, attested, in, north, arabian, inscriptions, include, ruda, nuha, allah, dathan, and, kahl, inscriptions, in, a, north, arabian, dialect, in, the, region, of, najd, referring, to, nuha, describe, emotions, as, a, gift, from, him, in, addition, they, also, refer, to, ruda, being, responsible, for, all, things, good, and, bad, the, safaitic, tribes, in, particular, prominently, worshipped, the, goddess, al, lat, as, a, bringer, of, prosperity, the, syrian, god, baalshamin, was, also, worshipped, by, safaitic, tribes, and, is, mentioned, in, safaitic, inscriptions, religious, worship, amongst, the, qedarites, an, ancient, tribal, confederation, that, was, probably, subsumed, into, nabataea, around, the, 2nd, century, ad, was, centered, around, a, polytheistic, system, in, which, women, rose, to, prominence, divine, images, of, the, gods, and, goddesses, worshipped, by, qedarite, arabs, as, noted, in, assyrian, inscriptions, included, representations, of, atarsamain, nuha, ruda, dai, abirillu, and, atarquruma, the, female, guardian, of, these, idols, usually, the, reigning, queen, served, as, a, priestess, apkallatu, in, assyrian, texts, who, communed, with, the, other, world, there, is, also, evidence, that, the, qedar, worshipped, al, lat, to, whom, the, inscription, on, a, silver, bowl, from, a, king, of, qedar, is, dedicated, in, the, babylonian, talmud, which, was, passed, down, orally, for, centuries, before, being, transcribed, c, 500, ad, in, tractate, taanis, folio, 5b, it, is, said, that, most, qedarites, worshiped, pagan, gods, the, aramaic, stele, inscription, discovered, by, charles, hubert, in, 1880, at, tayma, mentions, the, introduction, of, a, new, god, called, salm, of, hgm, into, the, city, s, pantheon, being, permitted, by, three, local, gods, salm, of, mahram, who, was, the, chief, god, shingala, and, ashira, the, name, salm, means, image, or, idol, the, midianites, a, people, referred, to, in, the, book, of, genesis, and, located, in, north, western, arabia, may, have, worshipped, yahweh, indeed, some, scholars, believe, that, yahweh, was, originally, a, midianite, god, and, that, he, was, subsequently, adopted, by, the, israelites, an, egyptian, temple, of, hathor, continued, to, be, used, during, the, midianite, occupation, of, the, site, although, images, of, hathor, were, defaced, suggesting, midianite, opposition, they, transformed, it, into, a, desert, tent, shrine, set, up, with, a, copper, sculpture, of, a, snake, the, lihyanites, worshipped, the, god, dhu, ghabat, and, rarely, turned, to, others, for, their, needs, dhu, ghabat, s, name, means, he, of, the, thicket, based, on, the, etymology, of, gabah, meaning, forest, or, thicket, the, god, al, kutba, a, god, of, writing, probably, related, to, a, babylonian, deity, and, perhaps, was, brought, into, the, region, by, the, babylonian, king, nabonidus, is, mentioned, in, lihyanite, inscriptions, as, well, the, worship, of, the, hermonian, gods, leucothea, and, theandrios, was, spread, from, phoenicia, to, arabia, according, to, the, book, of, idols, the, tayy, tribe, worshipped, al, fals, whose, idol, stood, on, jabal, aja, while, the, kalb, tribe, worshipped, wadd, who, had, an, idol, in, dumat, al, jandal, the, nabataeans, worshipped, primarily, northern, arabian, deities, under, foreign, influences, they, also, incorporated, foreign, deities, and, elements, into, their, beliefs,

god, is, attested, at, gerasa, alongside, hera, in, an, inscription, dated, to, the, first, century, a, d, while, an, arabian, god, is, also, attested, by, three, inscriptions, dated, to, the, second,

puteoli, in, italy, the, city, was, an, important, nexus, for, trade, to, the, near, east, and, it, is, known, to, have, had, a, nabataean, presence, during, the, mid, 1st, century, bce, a, minaean, altar, dedicated, to, wadd, evidently, existed, in, delos, containing, two, inscriptions, in, minaean, and, greek, respectively, the, bedouin, were, introduced, to, meccan, ritualistic, practices, as, they, frequented, settled, towns, of, the, hejaz, during, the, four, months, of, the, holy, truce, the, first, three, of, which, were, devoted, to, religious, observance, while, the, fourth, was, set, aside, for, trade, alan, jones, infers, from, bedouin, poetry, that, the, gods, even, allah, were, less, important, to, the, bedouins, than, fate, they, seem, to, have, had, little, trust, in, rituals, and, pilgrimages, as, means, of, propitiating, fate, but, had, recourse, to, divination, and, soothsayers, kahins, the, bedouins, regarded, some, trees, wells, caves, and, stones, as, sacred, objects, either, as, fetishes, or, as, means, of, reaching, a, deity, they, created, sanctuaries, where, people, could, worship, fetishes, the, bedouins, had, a, code, of, honor, which, fazlur, rahman, malik, states, may, be, regarded, as, their, religious, ethics, this, code, encompassed, women, bravery, hospitality, honouring, one, s, promises, and, pacts, and, vengeance, they, believed, that, the, ghost, of, a, slain, person, would, cry, out, from, the, grave, until, their, thirst, for, blood, was, quenched, practices, such, as, killing, of, infant, girls, were, often, regarded, as, having, religious, sanction, numerous, mentions, of, jinn, in, the, quran, and, testimony, of, both, pre, islamic, and, islamic, literature, indicate, that, the, belief, in, spirits, was, prominent, in, pre, islamic, bedouin, religion, however, there, is, evidence, that, the, word, jinn, is, derived, from, aramaic, ginnaye, which, was, widely, attested, in, palmyrene, inscriptions, the, aramaic, word, was, used, by, christians, to, designate, pagan, gods, reduced, to, the, status, of, demons, and, was, introduced, into, arabic, folklore, only, late, in, the, pre, islamic, era, julius, wellhausen, has, observed, that, such, spirits, were, thought, to, inhabit, desolate, dingy, and, dark, places, and, that, they, were, feared, one, had, to, protect, oneself, from, them, but, they, were, not, the, objects, of, a, true, cult, bedouin, religious, experience, also, included, an, apparently, indigenous, cult, of, ancestors, the, dead, were, not, regarded, as, powerful, but, rather, as, deprived, of, protection, and, needing, charity, of, the, living, as, a, continuation, of, social, obligations, beyond, the, grave, only, certain, ancestors, especially, heroes, from, which, the, tribe, was, said, to, derive, its, name, seem, to, have, been, objects, of, real, veneration, though, they, lack, any, surviving, physical, evidence, iranian, religions, may, have, existed, in, pre, islamic, arabia, on, account, of, sasanian, military, presence, along, the, persian, gulf, and, south, arabia, and, on, account, of, trade, routes, between, the, hejaz, and, iraq, according, to, islamic, era, sources, arabs, in, northeast, of, the, peninsula, converted, to, zoroastrianism, and, several, zoroastrian, temples, were, constructed, in, najd, there, is, also, evidence, of, existence, of, manichaeism, in, arabia, as, several, early, sources, indicate, a, presence, of, zandaqas, in, mecca, although, the, term, could, also, be, interpreted, as, referring, to, mazdakism, however, according, to, the, most, recent, research, by, tardieu, the, prevalence, of, manichaeism, in, mecca, during, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, when, islam, emerged, can, not, be, proven, similar, reservations, regarding, the, appearance, of, manichaeism, and, mazdakism, in, pre, islamic, mecca, are, offered, by, trompf, mikkelsen, et, al, in, their, latest, work, 2018, there, is, evidence, for, the, circulation, of, iranian, religious, ideas, in, the, form, of, persian, loan, words, in, quran, such, as, firdaws, paradise, zoroastrianism, was, also, present, in, eastern,

had, the, jizya, imposed, on, them, after, being, conquered, by, muhammad, are, mentioned, by, the, islamic, historian, al, baladhuri, according, to, serjeant, the, baharna, people, may, be, the, arabized, descendants, of, converts, from, the, original, population, of, ancient, persians, majus, as, well, as, other, religions, a, thriving, community, of, jewish, tribes, existed, in, pre,

tribes, living, in, the, peninsula, from, tomb, inscriptions, it, is, visible, that, jews, also, lived, in, mada, in, saleh, and, al, ula, there, is, evidence, that, jewish, converts, in, the, hejaz, were, regarded, as, jews, by, other, jews, as, well, as, by, non, jews, and, sought, advice, from, babylonian, rabbis, on, matters, of, attire, and, kosher, food, in, at, least, one, case, it, is, known, that, an, arab, tribe, agreed, to, adopt, judaism, as, a, condition, for, settling, in, a, town, dominated, by, jewish, inhabitants, some, arab, women, in, yathrib, medina, are, said, to, have, vowed, to, make, their, child, a, jew, if, the, child, survived, since, they, considered, the, jews, to, be, people, of, knowledge, and, the, book, ilmin, wa, kit, bin, philip, hitti, infers, from,

sixth, century, the, jewish, communities, in, the, hejaz, were, in, a, state, of, economic, and, political, decline, but, they, continued, to, flourish, culturally, in, and, beyond, the, region, they, had, developed, their, distinctive, beliefs, and, practices, with, a, pronounced, mystical, and, eschatological, dimension, in, the, islamic, tradition, based, on, a, phrase, in, the, quran, arab, jews, are, said, to, have, referred, to, uzair, as, the, son, of, allah, although, the, historical, accuracy, of, this, assertion, has, been, disputed, jewish, agriculturalists, lived, in, the,

influence, of, the, sassanians, from, the, early, third, century, many, of, the, inhabitants, were, exposed, to, christianity, following, the, eastward, dispersal, of, the, religion, by, mesopotamian, christians, however, it, was, not, until, the, fourth, century, that, christianity, gained, popularity, in, the, region, with, the, establishment, of, monasteries, and, a, diocesan, structure, in,

neal, robinson, based, on, verses, in, the, quran, believes, that, some, arab, christians, may, have, held, unorthodox, beliefs, such, as, the, worshipping, of, a, divine, triad, of, god, the, father, jesus, the, son, and, mary, the, mother, furthermore, there, is, evidence, that, unorthodox, groups, such, as, the, collyridians, whose, adherents, worshipped, mary, were, present, in, arabia, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, quran, refers, to, their, beliefs, however, other, scholars, notably, mircea, eliade, william, montgomery, watt, g, r, hawting, and, sidney, h, griffith, cast, doubt, on, the, historicity, or, reliability, of, such, references, in, the, quran, their, views, are, as, follows
