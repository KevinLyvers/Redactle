the, veneration, of, the, dead, including, one, s, ancestors, is, based, on, love, and, respect, for, the, deceased, in, some, cultures, it, is, related, to, beliefs, that, the, dead, have, a, continued, existence, and, may, possess, the, ability, to, influence, the, fortune, of, the, living, some, groups, venerate, their, direct, familial, ancestors, certain, religious, groups, in, particular, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, catholic, church, and, anglican, church, venerate, saints, as, intercessors, with, god, the, latter, also, believes, in, prayer, for, departed, souls, in, purgatory, other, religious, groups, however, consider, veneration, of, the, dead, to, be, idolatry, and, a, sin, in, european, asian, oceanian, african, and, afro, diasporic, cultures, which, includes, but, should, be, distinguished, from, multiple, cultures, and, indigenous, populations, in, the, americas, who, were, never, influenced, by, the, african, diaspora, the, goal, of, ancestor, veneration, is, to, ensure, the, ancestors, continued, well, being, and, positive, disposition, towards, the, living, and, sometimes, to, ask, for, special, favours, or, assistance, the, social, or, non, religious, function, of, ancestor, veneration, is, to, cultivate, kinship, values, such, as, filial, piety, family, loyalty, and, continuity, of, the, family, lineage, ancestor, veneration, occurs, in, societies, with, every, degree, of, social, political, and, technological, complexity, and, it, remains, an, important, component, of, various, religious, practices, in, modern, times, ancestor, reverence, is, not, the, same, as, the, worship, of, a, deity, or, deities, in, some, afro, diasporic, cultures, ancestors, are, seen, as, being, able, to, intercede, on, behalf, of, the, living, often, as, messengers, between, humans, and, god, as, spirits, who, were, once, human, themselves, they, are, seen, as, being, better, able, to, understand, human, needs, than, would, a, divine, being, in, other, cultures, the, purpose, of, ancestor, veneration, is, not, to, ask, for, favors, but, to, do, one, s, filial, duty, some, cultures, believe, that, their, ancestors, actually, need, to, be, provided, for, by, their, descendants, and, their, practices, include, offerings, of, food, and, other, provisions, others, do, not, believe, that, the, ancestors, are, even, aware, of, what, their, descendants, do, for, them, but, that, the, expression, of, filial, piety, is, what, is, important, most, cultures, who, practice, ancestor, veneration, do, not, call, it, ancestor, worship, in, english, the, word, worship, usually, but, not, always, refers, to, the, reverent, love, and, devotion, accorded, a, deity, god, or, god, however, in, other, cultures, this, act, of, worship, does, not, confer, any, belief, that, the, departed, ancestors, have, become, some, kind, of, deity, rather, the, act, is, a, way, to, express, filial, duty, devotion, and, respect, and, look, after, ancestors, in, their, afterlives, as, well, as, seek, their, guidance, for, their, living, descendants, in, this, regard, many, cultures, and, religions, have, similar, practices, some, may, visit, the, graves, of, their, parents, or, other, ancestors, leave, flowers, and, pray, to, them, in, order, to, honor, and, remember, them, while, also, asking, their, ancestors, to, continue, to, look, after, them, however, this, would, not, be, considered, as, worshipping, them, since, the, term, worship, may, not, always, convey, such, meaning, in, the, exclusive, and, narrow, context, of, certain, western, european, christian, traditions, in, that, sense, the, phrase, ancestor, veneration, may, but, from, the, limited, perspective, of, certain, western, european, christian, traditions, convey, a, more, accurate, sense, of, what, practitioners, such, as, the, chinese, and, other, buddhist, influenced, and, confucian, influenced, societies, as, well, as, the, african, and, european, cultures, see, themselves, as, doing, this, is, consistent, with, the, meaning, of, the, word, veneration, in, english, that, is, great, respect, or, reverence, caused, by, the, dignity, wisdom, or, dedication, of, a, person, although, there, is, no, generally, accepted, theory, concerning, the, origins, of, ancestor, veneration, this, social, phenomenon, appears, in, some, form, in, all, human, cultures, documented, so, far, david, barrett, and, carney, claim, that, ancestor, veneration, might, have, served, a, group, coordination, role, during, human, evolution, and, thus, it, was, the, mechanism, that, led, to, religious, representation, fostering, group, cohesion, ancestor, veneration, is, prevalent, throughout, africa, and, serves, as, the, basis, of, many, religions, it, is, often, augmented, by, a, belief, in, a, supreme, being, but, prayers, and, or, sacrifices, are, usually, offered, to, the, ancestors, who, may, ascend, to, becoming, a, kind, of, minor, deities, themselves, ancestor, veneration, remains, among, many, africans, sometimes, practiced, alongside, the, later, adopted, religions, of, christianity, as, in, nigeria, among, the, igbo, people, and, islam, among, the, different, mand, peoples, and, the, bamum, and, the, bakossi, people, in, much, of, the, continent, in, orthodox, serer, religion, the, pangool, is, venerated, by, the, serer,

gravesite, pueblo, indians, supported, a, cult, of, the, dead, which, worshipped, or, petitioned, the, dead, through, ritualistic, dances, islam, has, a, complex, and, mixed, view, on, the, idea, of, grave, shrines, and, ancestor, worship, the, graves, of, many, early, islamic, figures, are, holy, sites, for, muslims, including, ali, and, a, cemetery, with, many, companions, and, early, caliphs, many, other, mausoleums, are, major, architectural, political, and, cultural, sites, including, the, national, mausoleum, in, pakistan, and, the, taj, mahal, in, india, however, the, religious, movement, of, wahhabism, disputes, the, concept, of, saint, veneration, followers, of, this, movement, have, destroyed, many, gravesite, shrines, including, in, saudi, arabia, and, in, territory, controlled, by, the, islamic, state, imam, ahmad, al, hakim, and, others, narrated, about, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, umayyad, governor, of, medina, that, he, once, passed, by, the, grave, of, the, prophet, and, saw, a, man, with, his, cheek, on, the, grave, of, the, prophet, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, asked, do, you, know, what, you, are, doing, nearing, the, grave, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, realized, it, was, abu, ayyub, al, ansariyy, one, of, the, greatest, companions, of, the, prophet, abu, ayyub, al, ansariyy, replied, yes, i, know, what, i, am, doing, i, came, here, for, the, messenger, of, allah, not, for, the, stone, by, this, he, meant, he, was, seeking, the, blessings, from, the, presence, of, the, prophet, not, for, the, stone, covering, his, grave, abu, ayyub, al, ansariyy, continued, his, response, with, what, he, heard, the, messenger, of, allah, say, do, not, cry, over, the, religion, of, islam, if, the, rulers, are, ruling, correctly, rather, cry, over, this, religion, if, the, rulers, are, ruling, incorrectly, by, his, response, abu, ayyub, was, telling, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, you, are, not, one, of, those, rulers, who, are, correctly, ruling, by, the, rules, of, islam, some, followers, of, islam, are, at, odds, with, the, concept, of, saint, veneration, but, this, practice, is, retained, in, turkey, particularly, through, alevi, muslims, judaism, like, islam, has, a, complicated, relationship, to, ancestor, veneration, worship, grave, shrines, and, other, related, concepts, it, is, thought, ancient, israelite, religion, and, pre, israelite, cannanites, practiced, a, form, of, ancestor, worship, in, which, ancestors, were, raised, to, the, status, of, gods, and, some, form, of, similar, practice, was, likely, seen, as, acceptable, in, israelite, religion, until, king, josiah, s, reign, in, biblical, literature, and, in, contemporary, prayer, the, ancestors, particularly, abraham, moses, aaron, jacob, israel, or, the, patriarchs, and, the, matriarchs, are, often, referred, to, stress, is, placed, on, the, identity, of, the, jewish, people, as, being, the, seed, house, or, children, of, these, figures, two, prayers, kaddish, and, yizkor, are, recited, on, behalf, of, the, dead, by, rabbinic, jews, including, on, anniversaries, of, a, death, for, some, the, performance, of, prayers, especially, prayers, in, their, first, year, after, death, from, their, children, are, thought, to, positively, impact, god, s, judgement, of, them, as, well, as, donations, and, other, good, works, done, in, their, name, this, is, similar, to, japanese, practices, and, other, ancestral, veneration, practices, overall, these, good, deeds, done, in, the, name, of, the, dead, are, reciprocated, by, the, dead, s, prayers, to, god, for, the, living, there, are, taboos, and, injunctions, the, living, must, follow, particularly, in, regard, to, their, direct, ancestors, not, to, use, the, remains, of, coffin, wood, for, other, purposes, to, bury, the, dead, in, a, proper, shroud, and, not, to, eat, or, drink, at, the, beginning, and, or, close, of, shabbat, as, that, is, when, spirits, of, the, dead, are, believed, to, eat, drink, and, bathe, one, who, eats, during, this, time, has, stolen, from, the, spirits, and, one, who, drinks, at, the, beginning, of, shabbat, risks, ingesting, contaminated, bathing, water, ashkenazi, jews, commonly, name, children, after, dead, relatives, and, are, hoped, to, embody, those, dead, s, positive, traits, eastern, european, jews, specifically, transform, the, concept, of, zechut, avot, the, merit, of, one, s, ancestors, used, to, explain, both, a, belief, that, the, dead, pray, on, behalf, of, the, deceased, and, a, prayer, to, god, to, remember, the, good, deeds, of, one, s, ancestors, and, be, merciful, in, judgement, into, the, related, idea, of, yichus, ovus, inherited, ancestral, status, in, contemporary, rabbinic, judaism, visiting, the, graves, of, tzaddikim, righteous, figures, akin, to, saints, has, long, remained, popular, including, the, graves, of, ancestral, figures, like, abraham, and, esther, these, visits, may, also, be, accompanied, by, petitions, of, the, dead, as, their, elevated, status, is, thought, to, give, them, more, direct, access, to, god, rabbinic, jews, stress, that, they, do, not, worship, the, dead, and, only, respect, and, honor, them, a, distinction, made, by, other, cultures, including, japanese, and, african, cultures, ancestor, worship, was, a, prominent, feature, of, many, historical, societies, although, some, historians, claim, that, ancient, egyptian, society, was, a, death, cult, because, of, its, elaborate, tombs, and, mummification, rituals, it, was, the, opposite, the, philosophy, that, this, world, is, but, a, vale, of, tears, and, that, to, die, and, be, with, god, is, a, better, existence, than, an, earthly, one, was, relatively, unknown, among, the, ancient, egyptians, this, was, not, to, say, that, they, were, unacquainted, with, the, harshness, of, life, rather, their, ethos, included, a, sense, of, continuity, between, this, life, and, the, next, the, egyptian, people, loved, the, culture, customs, and, religion, of, their, daily, lives, so, much, that, they, wanted, to, continue, them, in, the, next, although, some, might, hope, for, a, better, station, in, the, beautiful, west, egyptian, afterlife, tombs, were, housing, in, the, hereafter, and, so, they, were, carefully, constructed, and, decorated, just, as, homes, for, the, living, were, mummification, was, a, way, to, preserve, the, corpse, so, the, ka, soul, of, the, deceased, could, return, to, receive, offerings, of, the, things, s, he, enjoyed, while, alive, if, mummification, was, not, affordable, a, ka, statue, in, the, likeness, of, the, deceased, was, carved, for, this, purpose, the, blessed, dead, were, collectively, called, the, akhu, or, shining, ones, singular, akh, they, were, described, as, shining, as, gold, in, the, belly, of, nut, gr, nuit, and, were, indeed, depicted, as, golden, stars, on, the, roofs, of, many, tombs, and, temples, the, process, by, which, a, ka, became, an, akh, was, not, automatic, upon, death, it, involved, a, 70, day, journey, through, the, duat, or, otherworld, which, led, to, judgment, before, wesir, gr, osiris, lord, of, the, dead, where, the, ka, s, heart, would, be, weighed, on, a, scale, against, the, feather, of, ma, at, representing, truth, however, if, the, ka, was, not, properly, prepared, this, journey, could, be, fraught, with, dangerous, pitfalls, and, strange, demons, hence, some, of, the, earliest, religious, texts, discovered, such, as, the, papyrus, of, ani, commonly, known, as, the, book, of, the, dead, and, the, pyramid, texts, were, actually, written, as, guides, to, help, the, deceased, successfully, navigate, the, duat, if, the, heart, was, in, balance, with, the, feather, of, ma, at, the, ka, passed, judgment, and, was, granted, access, to, the, beautiful, west, as, an, akh, who, was, ma, a, heru, true, of, voice, to, dwell, among, the, gods, and, other, akhu, at, this, point, only, was, the, ka, deemed, worthy, to, be, venerated, by, the, living, through, rites, and, offerings, those, who, became, lost, in, the, duat, or, deliberately, tried, to, avoid, judgment, became, the, unfortunate, and, sometimes, dangerous, mutu, the, restless, dead, for, the, few, whose, truly, evil, hearts, outweighed, the, feather, the, goddess, ammit, waited, patiently, behind, wesir, s, judgment, seat, to, consume, them, she, was, a, composite, creature, resembling, three, of, the, deadliest, animals, in, egypt, the, crocodile, the, hippopotamus, and, the, lion, being, fed, to, ammit, was, to, be, consigned, to, the, eternal, void, to, be, unmade, as, a, ka, besides, being, eaten, by, ammit, the, worst, fate, a, ka, could, suffer, after, physical, death, was, to, be, forgotten, for, this, reason, ancestor, veneration, in, ancient, egypt, was, an, important, rite, of, remembrance, in, order, to, keep, the, ka, alive, in, this, life, as, well, as, in, the, next, royals, nobles, and, the, wealthy, made, contracts, with, their, local, priests, to, perform, prayers, and, give, offerings, at, their, tombs, in, return, the, priests, were, allowed, to, keep, a, portion, of, the, offerings, as, payment, for, services, rendered, some, tomb, inscriptions, even, invited, passers, by, to, speak, aloud, the, names, of, the, deceased, within, which, also, helped, to, perpetuate, their, memory, and, to, offer, water, prayers, or, other, things, if, they, so, desired, in, the, private, homes, of, the, less, wealthy, niches, were, carved, into, the, walls, for, the, purpose, of, housing, images, of, familial, akhu, and, to, serve, as, altars, of, veneration, many, of, these, same, religious, beliefs, and, ancestor, veneration, practices, are, still, carried, on, today, in, the, religion, of, kemetic, orthodoxy, it, is, thought, that, the, word, sheol, the, afterlife, referred, to, in, biblical, literature, comes, from, the, word, meaning, to, inquire, pre, israelite, cannanites, gave, their, ancestors, offerings, of, food, and, drink, as, well, as, symbolic, vessel, offerings, which, even, empty, provided, both, in, the, afterlife, in, light, of, this, honor, thy, father, and, mother, is, thought, by, some, to, have, referenced, this, practice, particularly, as, it, predates, the, ban, of, ancestor, worship, and, necromancy, by, josiah, the, romans, like, many, mediterranean, societies, regarded, the, bodies, of, the, dead, as, polluting, during, rome, s, classical, period, the, body, was, most, often, cremated, and, the, ashes, placed, in, a, tomb, outside, the, city, walls, much, of, the, month, of, february, was, devoted, to, purifications, propitiation, and, veneration, of, the, dead, especially, at, the, nine, day, festival, of, the, parentalia, during, which, a, family, honored, its, ancestors, the, family, visited, the, cemetery, and, shared, cake, and, wine, both, in, the, form, of, offerings, to, the, dead, and, as, a, meal, among, themselves, the, parentalia, drew, to, a, close, on, february, 21, with, the, more, somber, feralia, a, public, festival, of, sacrifices, and, offerings, to, the, manes, the, potentially, malevolent, spirits, of, the, dead, who, required, propitiation, one, of, the, most, common, inscriptional, phrases, on, latin, epitaphs, is, dis, manibus, abbreviated, d, m, for, the, manes, gods, which, appears, even, on, some, christian, tombstones, the, caristia, on, february, 22, was, a, celebration, of, the, family, line, as, it, continued, into, the, present, a, noble, roman, family, displayed, ancestral, images, imagines, in, the, tablinum, of, their, home, domus, some, sources, indicate, these, portraits, were, busts, while, others, suggest, that, funeral, masks, were, also, displayed, the, masks, probably, modeled, of, wax, from, the, face, of, the, deceased, were, part, of, the, funeral, procession, when, an, elite, roman, died, professional, mourners, wore, the, masks, and, regalia, of, the, dead, person, s, ancestors, as, the, body, was, carried, from, the, home, through, the, streets, and, to, its, final, resting, place
