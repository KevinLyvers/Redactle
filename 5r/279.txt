a, master, jp, r, shi, ch, sh, fu, who, may, be, depicted, as, an, iconoclastic, and, unconventional, figure, in, spite, of, this, most, zen, schools, also, promote, traditional, buddhist, practices, like, chanting, precepts, rituals, monasticism, and, scriptural, study, with, an, emphasis, on, buddha, nature, thought, intrinsic, enlightenment, and, sudden, awakening, zen, teaching, draws, from, numerous, buddhist, sources, including, sarv, stiv, da, meditation, the, mahayana, teachings, on, the, bodhisattva, yogachara, and, tath, gatagarbha, texts, like, the, la, k, vat, ra, and, the, huayan, school, the, praj, p, ramit, literature, as, well, as, madhyamaka, thought, have, also, been, influential, in, the, shaping, of, the, apophatic, and, sometimes, iconoclastic, nature, of, zen, rhetoric, the, word, zen, is, derived, from, the, japanese, pronunciation, kana, of, the, middle, chinese, word, middle, chinese, pinyin, ch, n, which, in, turn, is, derived, from, the, sanskrit, word, dhy, na, which, can, be, approximately, translated, as, contemplation, absorption, or, meditative, state, the, actual, chinese, term, for, the, zen, school, is, pinyin, ch, nz, ng, while, chan, just, refers, to, the, practice, of, meditation, itself, chinese, pinyin, x, ch, n, or, the, study, of, meditation, chinese, pinyin, ch, nxu, though, it, is, often, used, as, an, abbreviated, form, of, ch, nzong, zen, is, also, called, f, x, nz, ng, chinese, or, busshin, sh, japanese, the, buddha, mind, school, from, f, x, n, buddha, mind, this, term, can, refer, either, to, the, or, a, buddha, s, compassionate, and, enlightened, mind, or, to, the, originally, clear, and, pure, mind, inherent, in, all, beings, to, which, they, must, awaken, busshin, may, also, refer, to, buddhakaya, the, buddha, body, an, embodiment, of, awakened, activity, zen, is, traditionally, a, proper, noun, as, it, usually, describes, a, particular, buddhist, sect, in, more, recent, times, the, lowercase, zen, is, used, when, discussing, a, worldview, or, attitude, that, is, peaceful, and, calm, it, was, officially, added, to, the, merriam, webster, dictionary, in, 2018, the, practice, of, meditation, ch, ch, n, skt, dhy, na, especially, sitting, meditation, chinese, zu, ch, n, japanese, zazen, is, a, central, part, of, zen, buddhism, the, practice, of, buddhist, meditation, originated, in, india, and, first, entered, china, through, the, translations, of, an, shigao, fl, c, 148, 180, ce, and, kum, raj, va, 334, 413, ce, both, of, these, figures, translated, various, dhy, na, sutras, these, were, influential, meditation, texts, which, were, mostly, based, on, the, meditation, teachings, of, the, kashmiri, sarv, stiv, da, school, circa, 1st, 4th, centuries, ce, among, the, most, influential, early, chinese, meditation, texts, are, the, anban, shouyi, jing, sutra, on, n, p, nasm, ti, the, zuochan, sanmei, jing, sutra, of, sitting, dhy, na, sam, dhi, and, the, damoduoluo, chan, jing, dharmatrata, dhy, na, sutra, these, early, chinese, meditation, works, continued, to, exert, influence, on, zen, practice, well, into, the, modern, era, for, example, the, 18th, century, rinzai, zen, master, t, rei, enji, wrote, a, commentary, on, the, damoduoluo, chan, jing, and, used, the, zuochan, sanmei, jing, as, a, source, in, the, writing, of, this, commentary, t, rei, believed, that, the, damoduoluo, chan, jing, had, been, authored, by, bodhidharma, while, dhy, na, in, a, strict, sense, refers, to, the, classic, four, dhy, nas, in, chinese, buddhism, ch, n, may, refer, to, various, kinds, of, meditation, techniques, and, their, preparatory, practices, which, are, necessary, to, practice, dhy, na, the, five, main, types, of, meditation, in, the, dhy, na, sutras, are, n, p, nasm, ti, mindfulness, of, breathing, pa, ik, lamanasik, ra, meditation, mindfulness, of, the, impurities, of, the, body, maitr, meditation, loving, kindness, the, contemplation, on, the, twelve, links, of, prat, tyasamutp, da, and, contemplation, on, the, buddha, according, to, the, modern, chan, master, sheng, yen, these, practices, are, termed, the, five, methods, for, stilling, or, pacifying, the, mind, and, serve, to, focus, and, purify, the, mind, and, support, the, development, of, the, stages, of, dhyana, chan, buddhists, may, also, use, other, classic, buddhist, practices, like, the, four, foundations, of, mindfulness, and, the, three, gates, of, liberation, emptiness, or, nyat, signlessness, or, animitta, and, wishlessness, or, apra, ihita, early, chan, texts, also, teach, forms, of, meditation, that, are, unique, to, mah, y, na, buddhism, for, example, the, treatise, on, the, essentials, of, cultivating, the, mind, which, depicts, the, teachings, of, the, 7th, century, east, mountain, school, teaches, a, visualization, of, a, sun, disk, similar, to, that, taught, in, the, contemplation, sutra, according, to, charles, luk, there, was, no, single, fixed, method, in, early, chan, zen, all, the, various, buddhist, meditation, methods, were, simply, skillful, means, which, could, lead, a, meditator, to, the, buddha, mind, within, modern, scholars, like, robert, sharf, argue, that, early, chan, while, having, unique, teachings, and, myths, also, made, use, of, classic, buddhist, meditation, methods, and, this, is, why, it, is, hard, to, find, many, uniquely, chan, meditation, instructions, in, some, of, the, earliest, sources, however, sharf, also, notes, there, was, a, unique, kind, of, chan, meditation, taught, in, some, early, sources, which, also, tend, to, deprecate, the, traditional, buddhist, meditations, this, uniquely, zen, approach, goes, by, various, names, like, maintaining, mind, shouxin, maintaining, unity, shouyi, pacifying, the, mind, anxin, discerning, the, mind, guanxin, and, viewing, the, mind, kanxin, a, traditional, phrase, that, describes, this, practice, states, that, ch, n, points, directly, to, the, human, mind, to, enable, people, to, see, their, true, nature, and, become, buddhas, likewise, john, mcrae, notes, that, a, major, development, in, early, ch, an, was, the, rejection, of, some, of, the, traditional, techniques, in, favor, of, a, uniquely, zen, direct, approach, early, chan, sources, like, the, bodhidharma, anthology, the, platform, sutra, and, the, works, of, shenhui, criticize, traditional, meditation, methods, of, concentration, and, mindfulness, as, not, necessary, and, instead, promote, a, more, direct, and, sudden, method, for, example, the, bodhidharma, anthology, states, the, man, of, sharp, abilities, hears, of, the, path, without, producing, a, covetous, mind, he, does, not, even, produce, right, mindfulness, and, right, reflection, and, if, mind, is, not, produced, what, need, is, there, for, cross, legged, sitting, dhyana, similarly, the, platform, sutra, criticizes, the, practice, of, sitting, sam, dhi, one, is, enlightened, to, the, way, through, the, mind, how, could, it, depend, on, sitting, while, shenhui, s, four, pronouncements, criticize, the, freezing, stopping, activating, and, concentrating, of, the, mind, according, to, mcrae, the, first, explicit, statement, of, the, sudden, and, direct, approach, that, was, to, become, the, hallmark, of, ch, an, religious, practice, is, associated, with, the, east, mountain, school, it, is, a, method, named, maintaining, the, one, without, wavering, sh, u, y, b, y, the, one, being, the, true, nature, of, mind, or, suchness, which, is, equated, with, buddha, nature, sharf, writes, that, in, this, practice, one, turns, the, attention, from, the, objects, of, experience, to, the, nature, of, conscious, awareness, itself, the, innately, pure, buddha, nature, which, was, compared, to, a, clear, mirror, or, to, the, sun, which, is, always, shining, but, may, be, covered, by, clouds, this, type, of, meditation, is, based, on, classic, mah, y, na, ideas, which, are, not, uniquely, chan, but, according, to, mcrae, it, differs, from, traditional, practice, in, that, no, preparatory, requirements, no, moral, prerequisites, or, preliminary, exercises, are, given, and, is, without, steps, or, gradations, one, concentrates, understands, and, is, enlightened, all, in, one, undifferentiated, practice, zen, sources, also, use, the, term, tracing, back, the, radiance, or, turning, one, s, light, around, ch, f, n, zh, o, to, describe, seeing, the, inherent, radiant, source, of, the, mind, itself, the, numinous, awareness, luminosity, or, buddha, nature, the, platform, sutra, mentions, this, term, and, connects, it, with, seeing, one, s, original, face, the, record, of, linji, states, that, all, that, is, needed, to, obtain, the, dharma, is, to, turn, your, own, light, in, upon, yourselves, and, never, seek, elsewhere, the, japanese, zen, master, d, gen, describes, it, as, follows, you, should, stop, the, intellectual, practice, of, pursuing, words, and, learn, the, stepping, back, of, turning, the, light, around, and, shining, back, jp, ek, hensh, mind, and, body, will, naturally, drop, off, and, the, original, face, will, appear, similarly, the, korean, seon, master, y, ndam, yuil, states, to, use, one, s, own, mind, to, trace, the, radiance, back, to, the, numinous, awareness, of, one, s, own, mind, it, is, like, seeing, the, radiance, of, the, sun, s, rays, and, following, it, back, until, you, see, the, orb, of, the, sun, itself, sharf, also, notes, that, this, early, notion, of, contemplating, a, pure, buddha, mind, was, tempered, and, balanced, by, other, zen, sources, with, terms, like, no, mind, wuxin, and, no, mindfulness, wunien, to, avoid, any, metaphysical, reification, of, mind, and, any, clinging, to, mind, or, language, this, kind, of, negative, madhyamaka, style, dialectic, is, found, in, early, zen, sources, like, the, treatise, on, no, mind, wuxin, lun, and, the, platform, sutra, these, sources, tend, to, emphasize, emptiness, negation, and, absence, wusuo, as, the, main, theme, of, contemplation, these, two, contemplative, themes, the, buddha, mind, and, no, mind, positive, and, the, negative, rhetoric, continued, to, shape, the, development, of, zen, theory, and, practice, throughout, its, history, later, chinese, chan, buddhists, developed, their, own, meditation, chan, manuals, which, taught, their, unique, method, of, direct, and, sudden, contemplation, the, earliest, of, these, is, the, widely, imitated, and, influential, zu, ch, n, y, c, 11th, century, which, recommends, a, simple, contemplative, practice, which, is, said, to, lead, to, the, discovery, of, inherent, wisdom, already, present, in, the, mind, this, work, also, shows, the, influence, of, the, earlier, meditation, manuals, composed, by, tiantai, patriarch, zhiyi, however, other, zen, sources, de, emphasize, traditional, practices, like, sitting, meditation, and, instead, focus, on, effortlessness, and, on, ordinary, daily, activities, one, example, of, this, is, found, in, the, record, of, linji, which, states, followers, of, the, way, as, to, buddhadharma, no, effort, is, necessary, you, have, only, to, be, ordinary, with, nothing, to, do, defecating, urinating, wearing, clothes, eating, food, and, lying, down, when, tired, similarly, some, zen, sources, also, emphasize, non, action, or, having, no, concerns, wu, shih, for, example, chan, master, huangbo, states, that, nothing, compares, with, non, seeking, describing, the, zen, adept, as, follows, the, person, of, the, way, is, the, one, who, has, nothing, to, do, who, has, no, mind, at, all, and, no, doctrine, to, preach, having, nothing, to, do, such, a, person, lives, at, ease, zen, sources, which, focus, on, the, sudden, teaching, can, sometimes, be, quite, radical, in, their, rejection, of, the, importance, of, traditional, buddhist, ideas, and, practices, the, record, of, the, dharma, jewel, through, the, ages, lidai, fabao, ji, for, example, states, better, that, one, should, destroy, la, and, not, destroy, true, seeing, la, rebirth, in, heaven, adding, more, bonds, while, true, seeing, attains, nirv, a, similarly, the, bloodstream, sermon, states, that, it, doesn, t, matter, whether, one, is, a, butcher, or, not, if, one, sees, one, s, true, nature, then, one, will, not, be, affected, by, karma, the, bloodstream, sermon, also, rejects, worshiping, of, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, stating, that, those, who, hold, onto, appearances, are, devils, they, fall, from, the, path, why, worship, illusions, born, of, the, mind, those, who, worship, don, t, know, and, those, who, know, don, t, worship, similarly, the, lidai, fabao, ji, states, that, no, thought, is, none, other, than, seeing, the, buddha, and, rejects, the, practice, of, worship, and, recitation, most, famously, the, record, of, linji, has, the, master, state, that, if, you, meet, a, buddha, kill, the, buddha, as, well, as, patriarchs, arhats, parents, and, kinfolk, further, claiming, that, through, this, you, will, gain, emancipation, will, not, be, entangled, with, things, during, sitting, meditation, ch, zu, ch, n, jp, zazen, ko, jwaseon, practitioners, usually, assume, a, sitting, position, such, as, the, lotus, position, half, lotus, burmese, or, seiza, their, hands, often, placed, in, a, specific, gesture, or, mudr, often, a, square, or, round, cushion, placed, on, a, padded, mat, is, used, to, sit, on, in, some, other, cases, a, chair, may, be, used, to, regulate, the, mind, zen, students, are, often, directed, towards, counting, breaths, either, both, exhalations, and, inhalations, are, counted, or, one, of, them, only, the, count, can, be, up, to, ten, and, then, this, process, is, repeated, until, the, mind, is, calmed, zen, teachers, like, omori, sogen, teach, a, series, of, long, and, deep, exhalations, and, inhalations, as, a, way, to, prepare, for, regular, breath, meditation, attention, is, often, placed, on, the, energy, center, dantian, below, the, navel, zen, teachers, often, promote, diaphragmatic, breathing, stating, that, the, breath, must, come, from, the, lower, abdomen, known, as, hara, or, tanden, in, japanese, and, that, this, part, of, the, body, should, expand, forward, slightly, as, one, breathes, over, time, the, breathing, should, become, smoother, deeper, and, slower, when, the, counting, becomes, an, encumbrance, the, practice, of, simply, following, the, natural, rhythm, of, breathing, with, concentrated, attention, is, recommended, a, common, form, of, sitting, meditation, is, called, silent, illumination, ch, m, zh, o, jp, mokush, this, practice, was, traditionally, promoted, by, the, caodong, school, of, chinese, chan, and, is, associated, with, hongzhi, zhengjue, 1091, 1157, who, wrote, various, works, on, the, practice, this, method, derives, from, the, indian, buddhist, practice, of, the, union, skt, yuganaddha, of, amatha, and, vipa, yan, hongzhi, s, practice, of, silent, illumination, does, not, depend, on, concentration, on, particular, objects, such, as, visual, images, sounds, breathing, concepts, stories, or, deities, instead, it, is, a, non, dual, objectless, meditation, involving, withdrawal, from, exclusive, focus, on, a, particular, sensory, or, mental, object, this, practice, allows, the, meditator, to, be, aware, of, all, phenomena, as, a, unified, totality, without, any, conceptualizing, grasping, goal, seeking, or, subject, object, duality, according, to, leighton, this, method, rests, on, the, faith, verified, in, experience, that, the, field, of, vast, brightness, is, ours, from, the, outset, this, vast, luminous, buddha, field, is, our, immanent, inalienable, endowment, of, wisdom, which, cannot, be, cultivated, or, enhanced, instead, one, just, has, to, recognize, this, radiant, clarity, without, any, interference, a, similar, practice, is, taught, in, the, major, schools, of, japanese, zen, but, is, especially, emphasized, by, s, t, where, it, is, more, widely, known, as, shikantaza, ch, zh, gu, n, d, zu, just, sitting, this, method, is, discussed, in, the, works, of, the, japanese, s, t, zen, thinker, d, gen, especially, in, his, sh, b, genz, and, his, fukanzazengi, for, d, gen, shikantaza, is, characterized, by, hishiry, non, thinking, without, thinking, beyond, thinking, which, according, to, kasulis, is, a, state, of, no, mind, in, which, one, is, simply, aware, of, things, as, they, are, beyond, thinking, and, not, thinking, while, the, japanese, and, the, chinese, forms, of, these, simple, methods, are, similar, they, are, considered, distinct, approaches, during, the, song, dynasty, g, ng, n, jp, k, an, literature, became, popular, literally, meaning, public, case, they, were, stories, or, dialogues, describing, teachings, and, interactions, between, zen, masters, and, their, students, k, ans, are, meant, to, illustrate, zen, s, non, conceptual, insight, praj, a, during, the, song, a, new, meditation, method, was, developed, by, linji, school, figures, such, as, dahui, 1089, 1163, called, kanhua, chan, observing, the, phrase, meditation, which, referred, to, contemplation, on, a, single, word, or, phrase, called, the, huatou, critical, phrase, of, a, g, ng, n, dahui, famously, criticised, caodong, s, silent, illumination, while, the, two, methods, of, caodong, and, linji, are, sometimes, seen, as, competing, with, each, other, schl, tter, writes, that, dahui, himself, did, not, completely, condemn, quiet, sitting, in, fact, he, seems, to, have, recommended, it, at, least, to, his, monastic, disciples, in, chinese, chan, and, korean, seon, the, practice, of, observing, the, huatou, hwadu, in, korean, is, a, widely, practiced, method, it, was, taught, by, seon, masters, like, chinul, 1158, 1210, and, seongcheol, 1912, 1993, and, modern, chinese, masters, like, sheng, yen, and, xuyun, in, the, japanese, rinzai, school, k, an, introspection, developed, its, own, formalized, style, with, a, standardized, curriculum, of, k, ans, which, must, be, studied, meditated, on, and, passed, in, sequence, monks, are, instructed, to, become, one, with, their, koan, by, repeating, the, koan, s, question, constantly, they, are, also, advised, not, to, attempt, to, answer, it, intellectually, since, the, goal, of, the, practice, is, a, non, conceptual, insight, into, non, duality, the, zen, student, s, mastery, of, a, given, k, an, is, presented, to, the, teacher, in, a, private, interview, referred, to, in, japanese, as, dokusan, daisan, or, sanzen, the, process, includes, standardized, answers, checking, questions, sassho, and, common, sets, of, capping, phrase, jakugo, poetry, all, which, must, be, memorized, by, students, while, there, are, standardized, answers, to, a, k, an, practitioners, are, also, expected, to, demonstrate, their, spiritual, understanding, through, their, responses, the, teacher, may, approve, or, disapprove, of, the, answer, based, on, their, behavior, and, guide, the, student, in, the, right, direction, according, to, hori, the, traditional, japanese, rinzai, koan, curriculum, can, take, 15, years, to, complete, for, a, full, time, monk, the, interaction, with, a, teacher, is, central, in, zen, but, also, makes, zen, practice, vulnerable, to, misunderstanding, and, exploitation, k, an, inquiry, may, be, practiced, during, zazen, sitting, meditation, kinhin, walking, meditation, and, throughout, all, the, activities, of, daily, life, the, goal, of, the, practice, is, often, termed, kensho, seeing, one, s, true, nature, and, is, to, be, followed, by, further, practice, to, attain, a, natural, effortless, down, to, earth, state, of, being, the, ultimate, liberation, knowing, without, any, kind, of, defilement, this, style, of, k, an, practice, is, particularly, emphasized, in, modern, rinzai, but, it, also, occurs, in, other, schools, or, branches, of, zen, depending, on, the, teaching, line, in, the, caodong, and, soto, traditions, koans, were, studied, and, commented, on, for, example, hongzhi, published, a, collection, of, koans, and, dogen, discussed, koans, extensively, however, they, were, not, traditionally, used, in, sitting, meditation, some, zen, masters, have, also, critiqued, the, practice, of, using, koans, for, meditation, according, to, haskel, bankei, called, k, ans, old, wastepaper, and, saw, the, k, an, method, as, hopelessly, contrived, similarly, the, song, era, master, foyan, qingyuan, 1067, 1120, rejected, the, use, of, koans, public, cases, and, similar, stories, arguing, that, they, did, not, exist, during, the, time, of, bodhidharma, and, that, the, true, koan, is, what, is, presently, coming, into, being, nianfo, jp, nembutsu, from, skt, buddh, nusm, ti, recollection, of, the, buddha, refers, to, the, recitation, of, the, buddha, s, name, in, most, cases, the, buddha, amitabha, in, chinese, chan, the, pure, land, practice, of, nianfo, based, on, the, phrase, n, m, m, tu, f, homage, to, amitabha, is, a, widely, practiced, form, of, zen, meditation, which, came, to, be, known, as, nianfo, chan, nianfo, was, practiced, and, taught, by, early, chan, masters, like, daoxin, 580, 651, who, taught, that, one, should, bind, the, mind, to, one, buddha, and, exclusively, invoke, his, name, the, practice, is, also, taught, in, shenxiu, s, kuan, hsin, lun, likewise, the, ch, uan, fa, pao, chi, taisho, 2838, ca, 713, one, of, the, earliest, chan, histories, shows, this, practice, was, widespread, in, the, early, chan, generation, of, hung, jen, fa, ju, and, ta, tung, who, are, said, to, have, invoked, the, name, of, the, buddha, so, as, to, purify, the, mind, evidence, for, the, practice, of, nianfo, chan, can, also, be, found, in, changlu, zongze, s, died, c, 1107, chanyuan, qinggui, the, rules, of, purity, in, the, chan, monastery, perhaps, the, most, influential, ch, an, monastic, code, in, east, asia, nianfo, continued, to, be, taught, as, a, form, of, chan, meditation, by, later, chinese, figures, such, as, yongming, yanshou, zhongfen, mingben, and, tianru, weize, during, the, late, ming, the, tradition, of, nianfo, chan, meditation, was, continued, by, figures, such, as, yunqi, zhuhong, and, hanshan, deqing, chan, figures, like, yongming, yanshou, generally, advocated, a, view, called, mind, only, pure, land, wei, hsin, ching, t, u, which, held, that, the, buddha, and, the, pure, land, are, just, mind, the, practice, of, nianfo, as, well, as, its, adaptation, into, the, nembutsu, k, an, is, a, major, practice, in, the, japanese, baku, school, of, zen, the, recitation, of, a, buddha, s, name, was, also, practiced, in, the, soto, school, at, different, times, throughout, its, history, during, the, meiji, period, for, example, both, shaka, nembutsu, reciting, the, name, of, shakyamuni, buddha, namu, shakamuni, butsu, and, amida, nembutsu, were, promoted, by, soto, school, priests, as, easy, practices, for, laypersons, nianfo, chan, is, also, widely, practiced, in, vietnamese, thien, since, zen, is, a, form, of, mahayana, buddhism, it, is, grounded, on, the, schema, of, the, bodhisattva, path, which, is, based, on, the, practice, of, the, transcendent, virtues, or, perfections, skt, p, ramit, ch, b, lu, m, jp, baramitsu, as, well, as, the, taking, of, the, bodhisattva, vows, the, most, widely, used, list, of, six, virtues, is, generosity, moral, training, incl, five, precepts, patient, endurance, energy, or, effort, meditation, dhyana, wisdom, an, important, source, for, these, teachings, is, the, avatamsaka, sutra, which, also, outlines, the, grounds, bhumis, or, levels, of, the, bodhisattva, path, the, p, ramit, s, are, mentioned, in, early,

was, highly, inclusive, and, ecumenical, this, extended, to, esoteric, buddhist, lore, and, rituals, that, appear, in, seon, literature, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, according, to, s, rensen, the, writings, of, several, seon, masters, such, as, hyujeong, reveal, they, were, esoteric, adepts, in, japanese, zen, the, use, of, esoteric, practices, within, zen, is, sometimes, termed, mixed, zen, kensh, zen, and, the, influential, soto, monk, keizan, j, kin, 1264, 1325, was, major, promoter, of, esoteric, methods, keizan, was, heavily, influenced, by, shingon, and, shugendo, and, is, known, for, introducing, numerous, esoteric, ritual, forms, into, the, soto, school, another, influential, soto, figure, menzan, zuih, 1683, 1769, was, also, a, practitioner, of, shingon, having, received, esoteric, initiation, under, a, shingon, figure, named, kisan, biku, similarly, numerous, rinzai, figures, were, also, esoteric, practitioners, such, as, the, rinzai, founder, my, an, eisai, 1141, 1215, and, enni, ben, en, 1202, 1280, under, enni, ben, en, s, abbotship, fumon, in, the, future, t, fuku, ji, held, shingon, and, tendai, rituals, he, also, lectured, on, the, esoteric, mahavairocana, sutra, certain, arts, such, as, painting, calligraphy, poetry, gardening, flower, arrangement, tea, ceremony, and, others, have, also, been, used, as, part, of, zen, training, and, practice, classical, chinese, arts, like, brush, painting, and, calligraphy, were, used, by, chan, monk, painters, such, as, guanxiu, and, muqi, fachang, to, communicate, their, spiritual, understanding, in, unique, ways, to, their, students, some, zen, writes, even, argued, that, devotion, to, an, art, japanese, suki, could, be, a, spiritual, practice, that, leads, to, enlightenment, as, the, japanese, monk, poet, ch, mei, writes, in, his, hosshinsh, zen, paintings, are, sometimes, termed, zenga, in, japanese, hakuin, is, one, japanese, zen, master, who, was, known, to, create, a, large, corpus, of, unique, sumi, e, ink, and, wash, paintings, and, japanese, calligraphy, to, communicate, zen, in, a, visual, way, his, work, and, that, of, his, disciples, were, widely, influential, in, japanese, zen, another, example, of, zen, arts, can, be, seen, in, the, short, lived, fuke, sect, of, japanese, zen, which, practiced, a, unique, form, of, blowing, zen, suizen, by, playing, the, shakuhachi, bamboo, flute, traditional, martial, arts, like, chinese, martial, arts, japanese, archery, other, forms, of, japanese, bud, have, also, been, seen, as, forms, of, zen, praxis, by, some, zen, schools, in, china, this, trend, goes, back, to, the, influential, shaolin, monastery, in, henan, which, developed, the, first, institutionalized, form, of, g, ngfu, by, the, late, ming, shaolin, g, ngfu, was, very, popular, and, widespread, as, evidenced, by, mentions, in, various, forms, of, ming, literature, featuring, staff, wielding, fighting, monks, like, sun, wukong, and, historical, sources, which, also, speak, of, shaolin, s, impressive, monastic, army, that, rendered, military, service, to, the, state, in, return, for, patronage, these, shaolin, practices, which, began, to, develop, around, the, 12th, century, were, also, traditionally, seen, as, a, form, of, chan, buddhist, inner, cultivation, today, called, wuchan, martial, chan, the, shaolin, arts, also, made, use, of, taoist, physical, exercises, daoyin, breathing, and, qi, cultivation, qigong, practices, they, were, seen, as, therapeutic, practices, which, improved, internal, strength, neili, health, and, longevity, lit, nourishing, life, yangsheng, as, well, as, means, to, spiritual, liberation, the, influence, of, these, taoist, practices, can, be, seen, in, the, work, of, wang, zuyuan, ca, 1820, after, 1882, whose, illustrated, exposition, of, internal, techniques, neigong, tushuo, shows, how, shaolin, monks, drew, on, taoist, methods, like, those, of, the, yijin, jing, and, eight, pieces, of, brocade, according, to, the, modern, chan, master, sheng, yen, chinese, buddhism, has, adopted, internal, cultivation, exercises, from, the, shaolin, tradition, as, ways, to, harmonize, the, body, and, develop, concentration, in, the, midst, of, activity, this, is, because, techniques, for, harmonizing, the, vital, energy, are, powerful, assistants, to, the, cultivation, of, samadhi, and, spiritual, insight, korean, seon, also, has, developed, a, similar, form, of, active, physical, training, termed, sunmudo, in, japan, the, classic, combat, arts, bud, and, zen, practice, have, been, in, contact, since, the, embrace, of, rinzai, zen, by, the, h, j, clan, in, the, 13th, century, who, applied, zen, discipline, to, their, martial, practice, one, influential, figure, in, this, relationship, was, the, rinzai, priest, takuan, s, h, who, was, well, known, for, his, writings, on, zen, and, bud, addressed, to, the, samurai, class, especially, his, the, unfettered, mind, the, rinzai, school, also, adopted, certain, chinese, practices, which, work, with, qi, which, are, also, common, in, taoism, they, were, introduced, by, hakuin, 1686, 1769, who, learned, various, techniques, from, a, hermit, named, hakuyu, who, helped, hakuin, cure, his, zen, sickness, a, condition, of, physical, and, mental, exhaustion, these, energetic, practices, known, as, naikan, are, based, on, focusing, the, mind, and, one, s, vital, energy, ki, on, the, tanden, a, spot, slightly, below, the, navel, zen, is, grounded, in, the, rich, doctrinal, background, of, east, asian, mahayana, buddhism, zen, doctrinal, teaching, is, thoroughly, influenced, by, the, mahayana, buddhist, teachings, on, the, bodhisattva, path, chinese, madhyamaka, s, nl, n, yogacara, w, ish, the, praj, aparamita, literature, and, buddha, nature, texts, like, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, and, the, nirvana, sutra, some, zen, traditions, especially, linji, rinzai, focused, traditions, stress, a, narrative, which, sees, zen, as, a, special, transmission, outside, scriptures, which, does, not, stand, upon, words, nevertheless, mahayana, buddhist, doctrine, and, east, asian, buddhist, teachings, remain, an, essential, part, of, zen, buddhism, various, zen, masters, throughout, the, history, of, zen, like, guifeng, zongmi, jinul, and, yongming, yanshou, have, instead, promoted, the, correspondence, of, the, teachings, and, zen, which, argues, for, the, unity, of, zen, and, the, buddhist, teachings, in, zen, doctrinal, teaching, is, often, compared, to, the, finger, pointing, at, the, moon, while, zen, doctrines, point, to, the, moon, awakening, the, dharma, realm, the, originally, enlightened, mind, one, should, not, mistake, fixating, on, the, finger, the, teachings, to, be, zen, instead, one, must, look, at, the, moon, reality, as, such, doctrinal, teachings, are, just, another, skillful, means, upaya, which, can, help, one, attain, awakening, they, are, not, the, goal, of, zen, nor, are, they, held, as, fixed, dogmas, to, be, attached, to, since, ultimate, reality, transcends, all, concepts, but, are, nevertheless, seen, as, useful, as, long, as, one, does, not, reify, them, or, cling, to, them, the, complex, mahayana, buddhist, notion, of, buddha, nature, sanskrit, buddhadh, tu, chinese, f, x, ng, was, a, key, idea, in, the, doctrinal, development, of, zen, and, remains, central, to, zen, buddhism, in, china, this, doctrine, developed, to, encompass, the, related, teaching, of, original, enlightenment, b, nju, which, held, that, the, awakened, mind, of, a, buddha, is, already, present, in, each, sentient, being, and, that, enlightenment, is, inherent, from, the, outset, and, accessible, in, the, present, drawing, on, sources, like, the, lankavatara, sutra, the, buddha, nature, sutras, the, awakening, of, faith, and, the, sutra, of, perfect, enlightenment, chan, masters, championed, the, view, that, the, innately, awakened, buddha, mind, was, immanently, present, within, all, beings, following, the, view, of, the, awakening, of, faith, this, awakened, buddha, nature, is, seen, in, zen, as, the, empty, source, of, all, things, the, ultimate, principle, li, out, of, which, all, phenomena, ch, shi, i, e, all, dharmas, arise, thus, the, zen, path, is, one, of, recognizing, the, inherently, enlightened, source, that, is, already, here, indeed, the, zen, insight, and, the, zen, path, are, based, on, that, very, innate, awakening, by, the, time, of, the, codification, of, the, platform, sutra, c, 8th, to, 13th, century, the, zen, scripture, par, excellence, original, enlightenment, had, become, a, central, teaching, of, the, zen, tradition, historically, influential, chan, schools, like, east, mountain, and, hongzhou, drew, on, the, awakening, of, faith, in, its, teachings, on, the, buddha, mind, the, true, mind, as, suchness, which, hongzhou, compared, to, a, clear, mirror, similarly, the, tang, master, guifeng, zongmi, draws, on, the, sutra, of, perfect, enlightenment, when, he, writes, that, all, sentient, beings, without, exception, have, the, intrinsically, enlightened, true, mind, which, is, a, clear, and, bright, ever, present, awareness, that, gets, covered, over, by, deluded, thoughts, the, importance, of, the, concept, of, the, innately, awakened, mind, for, zen, is, such, that, it, even, became, an, alternative, name, for, zen, the, buddha, mind, school, the, influence, of, madhyamaka, and, praj, aparamita, on, zen, can, be, discerned, in, the, zen, stress, on, emptiness, k, ng, non, conceptual, wisdom, skt, nirvikalpa, j, ana, the, teaching, of, no, mind, and, the, apophatic, and, sometimes, paradoxical, language, of, zen, literature, zen, masters, and, texts, took, great, pains, to, avoid, the, reification, of, doctrinal, concepts, and, terms, including, important, terms, like, buddha, nature, and, enlightenment, this, is, because, zen, affirms, the, mahayana, view, of, emptiness, which, states, that, all, phenomena, lack, a, fixed, and, independent, essence, svabhava, to, avoid, any, reification, which, grasps, at, essences, zen, sources, often, make, use, of, a, negative, dialectic, influenced, by, madhyamaka, philosophy, as, kasulis, writes, since, all, things, are, empty, the, zen, student, must, learn, not, to, think, of, linguistic, distinctions, as, always, referring, to, ontically, distinct, realities, indeed, all, doctrines, distinctions, and, words, are, relative, and, deceptive, in, some, way, and, thus, they, must, be, transcended, this, apophatic, element, of, zen, teaching, is, sometimes, described, as, mu, ch, w, no, which, appears, in, the, famous, zhaozhou, s, dog, koan, a, monk, asked, does, a, dog, have, a, buddha, nature, or, not, the, master, said, not, zen, teachings, also, often, include, a, seemingly, paradoxical, use, of, both, negation, and, affirmation, for, example, the, teachings, of, the, influential, tang, dynasty, master, mazu, daoyi, founder, of, the, hongzhou, school, could, include, affirmative, phrases, like, mind, is, buddha, as, well, as, negative, ones, like, it, is, neither, mind, nor, buddha, since, no, concepts, or, differentiations, can, capture, the, true, nature, of, things, zen, affirms, the, importance, of, the, non, conceptual, and, non, differentiating, perfection, of, wisdom, praj, aparamita, which, transcends, all, relative, and, conventional, language, even, the, language, of, negation, itself, according, to, kasulis, this, is, the, basis, of, much, apophatic, rhetoric, found, in, zen, which, often, seems, paradoxical, or, contradictory, the, importance, of, negation, is, also, seen, in, the, key, zen, teaching, of, no, mind, wuxin, which, is, considered, to, be, a, state, of, meditative, clarity, free, of, concepts, defilements, and, clinging, which, is, also, associated, with, wisdom, and, a, direct, experience, of, the, ultimate, truth, zen, texts, also, stress, the, concept, of, non, duality, skt, advaya, ch, which, is, an, important, theme, in, zen, literature, and, is, explained, in, various, different, ways, one, set, of, themes, is, the, non, dual, unity, of, the, absolute, and, the, relative, truths, which, derives, from, the, classic, buddhist, theme, of, the, two, truths, this, can, be, found, in, zen, sources, like, the, five, ranks, of, tozan, faith, in, mind, and, the, harmony, of, difference, and, sameness, it, is, also, an, important, theme, in, mahayana, sutras, which, are, important, to, zen, like, the, vimalak, rtinirde, a, and, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, a, related, explanation, of, non, duality, which, is, influential, in, zen, makes, use, of, the, chinese, buddhist, discourse, of, essence, function, ch, tiyong, which, is, most, famously, taught, in, the, influential, awakening, of, faith, in, this, type, of, discourse, the, essence, refers, to, the, inner, nature, of, things, the, absolute, reality, while, the, functions, refer, to, the, more, external, relative, and, secondary, characteristics, of, things, the, platform, sutra, compares, the, essence, to, a, lamp, while, the, function, is, its, light, another, application, of, non, duality, in, zen, discourse, is, the, idea, that, mundane, reality, which, includes, the, natural, world, i, e, samsara, the, world, of, suffering, and, nirvana, the, ultimate, enlightened, reality, are, not, separate, this, is, a, view, found, in, indian, mahayana, sources, like, nagarjuna, s, root, verses, on, madhyamaka, as, such, buddhas, and, sentient, beings, as, well, as, buddhahood, and, the, natural, world, are, also, considered, to, be, non, dual, in, zen, this, idea, influenced, zen, attitudes, on, social, harmony, and, harmony, he, with, the, natural, world, a, further, meaning, of, non, duality, in, zen, is, as, the, absence, of, a, duality, between, the, perceiving, subject, and, the, perceived, object, this, understanding, of, non, duality, is, derived, from, the, indian, yogachara, school, the, philosophy, of, the, huayan, school, also, had, an, influence, on, chinese, chan, s, conception, of, the, non, dual, ultimate, truth, and, its, understanding, of, essence, function, one, example, is, the, huayan, doctrine, of, the, interpenetration, of, phenomena, or, perfect, interfusion, yuanrong, which, also, makes, use, of, native, chinese, philosophical, concepts, such, as, principle, li, and, phenomena, shi, the, influence, of, the, related, huayan, theory, of, the, fourfold, dharmadhatu, can, be, seen, in, the, five, ranks, of, dongshan, liangjie, 806, 869, the, founder, of, the, caodong, lineage, of, chan, the, idea, of, the, immanent, character, of, buddha, nature, influenced, zen, s, characteristic, emphasis, on, a, direct, insight, as, such, a, central, topic, of, discussion, in, zen, is, seeing, the, nature, pinyin, ji, nx, ng, jp, kensh, zen, teachings, use, this, term, to, refer, to, an, insight, which, can, occur, to, a, zen, practitioner, suddenly, and, often, equate, it, with, a, kind, of, enlightenment, the, nature, here, is, the, buddha, nature, the, originally, enlightened, mind, as, such, this, experience, provides, one, with, a, glimpse, of, the, ultimate, truth, the, term, ji, nx, ng, occurs, in, the, classic, zen, phrase, seeing, one, s, nature, becoming, buddha, which, is, held, to, encapsulate, the, meaning, of, zen, zen, schools, have, disagreed, with, each, other, on, how, to, achieve, seeing, nature, the, linji, school, s, huatou, practice, vs, caodong, s, silent, illumination, as, well, as, how, to, relate, to, cultivate, express, and, deepen, one, s, relationship, with, the, experience, this, remains, a, major, topic, of, debate, and, discussion, among, contemporary, zen, traditions, traditionally, zen, considers, that, its, practices, aim, at, a, sudden, insight, into, the, true, nature, of, things, this, idea, of, sudden, enlightenment, or, instant, awakening, d, nw, which, is, closely, related, to, seeing, the, nature, is, another, important, theme, in, zen, zen, sources, often, argue, that, its, sudden, method, is, more, direct, and, superior, to, the, gradual, paths, which, take, place, in, a, step, by, step, fashion, such, methods, can, be, found, in, some, of, the, earliest, zen, traditions, like, the, east, mountain, school, s, teaching, of, maintaining, the, one, a, direct, contemplation, on, buddha, nature, that, was, not, dependent, on, preliminary, practices, or, step, by, step, instructions, the, sudden, teaching, was, further, emphasized, by, patriarch, shenhui, and, it, became, canonized, as, a, key, zen, teaching, in, the, platform, sutra, in, spite, of, the, rhetorical, emphasis, on, sudden, awakening, and, the, critique, of, gradual, methods, found, in, various, zen, sources, zen, traditions, do, not, reject, gradual, practices, such, as, taking, precepts, scriptural, study, ritual, practice, and, the, six, paramitas, instead, zen, schools, generally, incorporate, these, practices, within, a, schema, grounded, in, sudden, enlightenment, thought, as, such, many, zen, sources, which, emphasize, sudden, awakening, like, the, platform, sutra, also, refer, to, traditional, mahayana, practices, this, means, that, the, zen, path, does, not, end, at, seeing, the, nature, since, further, practice, and, cultivation, is, considered, necessary, to, deepen, one, s, insight, remove, the, traces, of, the, defilements, attachments, aversions, etc, and, to, learn, to, express, buddha, nature, in, daily, life, zen, masters, like, zongmi, described, this, method, as, sudden, enlightenment, followed, by, gradual, cultivation, holding, that, the, sudden, and, gradual, teachings, point, to, the, same, truth, zongmi, argued, that, even, though, sudden, awakening, reveals, the, truth, directly, and, instantly, the, zen, practitioner, still, has, deeply, rooted, defilements, skt, kle, a, ch, f, nn, o, which, cloud, the, mind, and, can, only, be, removed, through, further, training, this, sudden, gradual, schema, became, a, standard, view, of, zen, practice, in, china, after, the, time, of, zongmi, it, is, found, in, zen, sources, like, dongshan, s, five, ranks, the, works, of, jinul, the, four, ways, of, knowing, of, hakuin, torei, s, undying, lamp, of, zen, and, the, ten, ox, herding, pictures, which, depict, a, gradual, set, of, steps, on, the, zen, path, while, also, including, the, idea, of, a, sudden, awakening, to, an, immanent, innate, pure, nature, today, there, are, two, major, traditions, or, groupings, of, zen, schools, along, with, numerous, other, smaller, lineages, orders, and, schools, the, two, main, lineages, are, the, caodong, tradition, traced, back, to, dongshan, liangjie, 807, 869, and, the, linji, school, which, is, traced, to, linji, yixuan, died, 866, ce, during, the, song, dynasty, the, caodong, lineage, became, closely, associated, with, the, teaching, of, silent, illumination, ch, mozhao, as, formulated, by, hongzhi, zhengjue, 1091, 1157, the, competing, linji, school, meanwhile, became, associated, with, the, contemplation, method, of, dahui, zonggao, 1089, 1163, which, focuses, on, meditating, on, the, huatou, critical, phrase, of, a, koan, some, traditions, and, organizations, include, both, lineages, so, these, categories, should, not, be, seen, as, mutually, exclusive, both, the, linji, school, and, the, caodong, school, were, transmitted, outside, of, china, to, japan, korea, and, vietnam, s, t, is, the, japanese, line, of, caodong, and, it, was, founded, by, d, gen, 1200, 1253, who, emphasized, the, practice, of, shikantaza, nothing, but, just, sitting, the, s, t, school, has, de, emphasized, k, ans, since, gent, sokuch, circa, 1800, a, vietnamese, caodong, lineage, t, o, ng, was, founded, by, 17th, century, chan, master, th, ng, gi, c, o, nam, recently, the, caodong, silent, illumination, method, was, revived, in, the, sinosphere, by, sheng, yen, and, his, dharma, drum, mountain, association, regarding, linji, it, is, known, in, japan, as, the, rinzai, school, this, tradition, emphasizes, meditation, on, k, ans, mediated, through, master, disciple, meetings, sanzen, as, the, essential, method, to, attain, kensh, seeing, one, s, true, nature, most, traditions, in, korean, seon, are, also, generally, in, the, linji, lineage, and, focus, on, huatou, practice, though, the, exact, methods, and, teachings, on, this, differ, there, are, also, vietnamese, lineages, of, linji, such, as, the, l, m, t, and, the, li, u, qu, n, schools, these, lineages, also, mix, zen, practice, with, pure, land, elements, besides, the, two, major, families, or, traditions, of, zen, there, are, several, smaller, schools, these, include, zen, practice, like, that, of, all, religions, is, supported, by, collective, endeavors, though, some, zen, sources, sometimes, emphasize, individual, experience, and, antinomianism, zen, traditions, are, maintained, and, transferred, by, mostly, hierarchical, temple, based, institutions, focused, around, a, core, of, ordained, clergy, these, zen, masters, or, teachers, ch, sh, fu, jp, r, shi, or, osh, may, or, may, not, be, celibate, monastics, bhiksus, who, follow, the, vinaya, the, traditional, buddhist, monastic, code, depending, on, the, tradition, some, important, zen, organizations, include, the, japanese, s, t, school, the, soto, zen, buddhist, association, of, america, the, various, independent, branches, of, japanese, rinzai, the, korean, jogye, and, taego, orders, and, the, chinese, dharma, drum, mountain, and, fo, guang, shan, organizations, in, japan, modernity, led, to, criticism, of, traditional, zen, institutions, and, new, lay, oriented, zen, schools, such, as, the, sanbo, kyodan, and, the, ningen, zen, kyodan, emerged, in, response, some, modern, challenges, for, contemporary, zen, include, how, to, organize, the, continuity, of, the, zen, tradition, constraining, charismatic, authority, with, the, risk, of, abuse, of, power, it, brings, on, the, one, hand, and, maintaining, the, legitimacy, of, traditional, authorities, by, limiting, the, number, of, authorized, teachers, on, the, other, hand, an, important, feature, of, traditional, zen, institutions, is, the, use, of, dharma, transmission, chinese, chu, n, f, from, master, to, disciple, to, pass, on, zen, lineages, to, the, next, generation, the, procedure, of, dharma, transmission, particularly, the, act, of, authorization, or, confirmation, ch, y, n, k, jp, inka, k, inga, is, considered, to, establish, a, zen, teacher, as, a, direct, successor, of, their, master, and, to, link, them, to, a, lineage, which, is, traditionally, believed, to, go, back, to, the, ancient, chinese, patriarchs, and, to, the, buddha, himself, these, transmissions, are, sometimes, seen, esoterically, as, the, mind, to, mind, transmission, of, the, light, of, awakening, from, master, to, disciple, scholars, like, william, bodiford, and, john, jorgensen, have, argued, that, this, ancestral, dimension, of, zen, which, sees, the, school, as, an, extended, family, is, influenced, by, confucian, values, and, that, it, is, part, of, what, allowed, zen, to, become, such, an, influential, form, of, buddhism, in, east, asia, zen, lineages, often, maintain, zen, lineage, charts, which, list, all, the, teachers, in, their, transmission, lineage, establishing, institutional, legitimacy, by, claiming, a, direct, link, from, the, buddha, to, the, present, indeed, according, to, michel, mohr, the, traditional, view, is, that, it, is, through, the, transmission, process, that, the, identity, and, integrity, of, the, lineage, is, preserved, zen, lineage, narratives, were, further, supported, by, transmission, of, the, lamp, texts, e, g, j, ngd, chu, nd, ngl, which, contained, stories, of, the, past, masters, and, legitimized, zen, lineages, these, texts, could, often, be, sectarian, favoring, a, specific, lineage, or, school, and, they, sometimes, even, led, to, conflict, among, the, zen, schools, furthermore, these, zen, transmission, narratives, were, often, not, historically, accurate, and, contain, mythological, material, developed, over, centuries, in, china, their, historicity, has, been, recently, critiqued, by, modern, scholars, the, formal, practice, of, dharma, transmission, is, generally, understood, in, two, main, ways, by, zen, traditions, it, can, be, seen, as, a, formal, recognition, of, a, disciple, s, deep, spiritual, realization, which, is, separate, from, clerical, ordination, it, could, also, be, understood, as, an, institutional, procedure, which, ensures, the, transmission, of, a, temple, lineage, the, institutions, of, dharma, transmission, have, come, under, criticism, in, various, times, throughout, zen, history, zen, masters, like, linji, and, ikky, were, said, to, have, refused, to, receive, transmission, certificates, seeing, the, procedure, as, corrupt, and, institutionalized, during, the, ming, dynasty, important, masters, like, hanshan, deqing, zibo, zhenke, and, yunqi, zhuhong, did, not, belong, to, any, formal, lineage, according, to, jiang, wu, these, eminent, ming, chan, monks, emphasized, self, cultivation, while, criticizing, formulaic, instructions, and, nominal, recognition, wu, writes, that, at, this, time, eminent, monks, who, practiced, meditation, and, asceticism, but, without, proper, dharma, transmission, were, acclaimed, as, acquiring, wisdom, without, teachers, wushizhi, hanshan, s, writings, indicate, that, he, seriously, questioned, the, value, of, dharma, transmission, seeing, personal, enlightenment, as, what, truly, mattered, in, zen, in, a, similar, fashion, several, important, medieval, japanese, masters, like, takuan, s, h, eschewed, formal, transmission, and, did, not, believe, it, was, necessary, since, the, dharma, was, always, available, to, be, discovered, within, some, of, these, figures, were, even, considered, self, enlightened, and, self, certified, jigo, jish, since, they, claimed, to, have, achieved, wisdom, without, a, teacher, pinyin, w, sh, zh, japanese, mushi, dokugo, they, include, suzuki, sh, san, and, my, shin, ji, figures, like, daigu, ungo, and, isshi, modern, chinese, buddhists, like, tanxu, taixu, and, yinshun, also, criticized, dharma, transmission, seeing, it, as, a, chinese, invention, that, was, not, taught, by, the, buddha, taixu, held, that, the, practice, led, to, sectarianism, and, tanxu, wrote, that, it, contributed, to, the, decline, of, zen, yinshun, believed, that, the, dharma, was, not, something, that, could, belong, to, anyone, and, thus, it, could, not, be, transmitted, in, a, lineage, zen, is, deeply, rooted, in, the, teachings, and, doctrines, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, classic, zen, texts, such, as, the, platform, sutra, contain, numerous, references, to, mah, y, na, sutras, according, to, sharf, zen, monastics, are, expected, to, become, familiar, with, the, classics, of, the, zen, canon, a, review, of, the, early, historical, literature, of, early, zen, clearly, reveals, that, their, authors, were, well, versed, in, numerous, mah, y, na, s, tras, as, well, as, mahayana, buddhist, philosophy, such, as, madhyamaka, nevertheless, zen, masters, are, sometimes, pictured, as, iconoclastically, anti, intellectual, and, dismissive, of, scriptural, study, or, at, least, as, weary, of, scripture, early, chan, sources, contain, numerous, statements, which, see, scriptural, study, as, unecessary, the, bodhidharma, anthology, for, example, states, don, t, use, knowledge, of, the, sutras, and, treatises, and, instead, states, one, should, return, to, the, ultimate, principle, firmly, abiding, without, shifting, in, no, way, following, after, the, written, teachings, the, bloodstream, sermon, states, the, true, way, is, sublime, it, can, t, be, expressed, in, language, of, what, use, are, scriptures, but, someone, who, sees, his, own, nature, finds, the, way, even, if, he, can, t, read, a, word, this, radical, antinomian, view, of, zen, became, more, pronounced, during, a, period, between, the, late, tang, and, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1297, when, ch, n, especially, the, hongzhou, school, became, the, dominant, in, china, and, gained, great, popularity, among, the, literary, classes, who, were, attracted, to, the, idea, that, true, sages, did, not, depend, on, texts, and, language, several, famous, phrases, from, this, period, defined, zen, as, not, established, on, words, and, letters, and, as, a, special, transmission, outside, the, scriptures, statements, which, were, anachronistically, attributed, to, bodhidharma, the, record, of, linji, is, even, more, radical, stating, that, the, buddhist, scriptures, are, all, so, much, old, toilet, paper, to, wipe, away, filth, another, example, of, this, attitute, is, found, in, the, story, of, deshan, xuanjian, who, is, known, for, having, burned, all, his, scriptural, commentaries, however, scholars, like, welter, and, hori, write, that, these, rhetorical, statements, were, not, a, complete, denial, of, the, importance, of, study, and, scripture, but, a, warning, to, those, who, mistake, the, teachings, for, the, direct, insight, into, truth, itself, indeed, chan, masters, of, this, period, continue, to, cite, and, refer, to, buddhist, sutra, passages, furthermore, not, all, masters, made, use, of, this, kind, of, rhetorical, chan, which, was, popular, in, the, chinese, linji, school, and, emphasized, a, direct, mind, to, mind, transmission, of, the, truth, from, master, to, disciple, while, de, emphasizing, sutra, study, another, contrasting, style, of, chinese, chan, was, a, more, moderate, literary, chan, wenzi, chan, associated, with, figures, like, nanyang, huizhong, zongmi, and, yongming, yanshou, this, type, of, chan, continued, to, actively, promote, doctrinal, study, as, a, part, of, chan, practice, with, the, slogan, of, the, correspondence, of, the, teachings, and, chan, chiao, ch, an, i, chih, even, mazu, daoyi, often, depicted, as, a, great, iconoclast, alludes, to, and, quotes, numerous, mahayana, sutras, as, do, other, hongzhou, school, masters, he, also, stated, in, his, sermons, that, bodhidharma, used, the, lank, vat, ra, scripture, to, seal, the, sentient, beings, mind, ground, zongmi, s, perspective, was, that, the, scriptures, are, like, a, marking, line, to, be, used, as, a, standard, to, determine, true, and, false, those, who, transmit, ch, an, must, use, the, scriptures, and, treatises, as, a, standard, juefan, huihong, 1071, 1128, coined, the, term, literary, chan, and, wrote, on, the, importance, of, studying, the, sutras, in, his, zhizheng, zhuan, commentary, on, wisdom, and, enlightenment, later, figures, like, zibo, zhenke, and, hanyue, fazang, 1573, 1635, promoted, the, view, of, chan, practice, which, makes, use, of, the, sutras, based, on, the, zhizheng, zhuan, similarly, the, japanese, rinzai, master, hakuin, writes, that, the, zen, path, begins, with, studying, all, the, classic, buddhist, sutras, and, commentaries, citing, one, of, the, four, vows, which, states, the, dharma, teachings, are, infinite, i, vow, to, study, them, all, as, such, while, the, various, zen, traditions, today, emphasize, that, enlightenment, arises, from, a, direct, non, conceptual, insight, they, also, generally, accept, that, study, and, understanding, of, the, buddhist, teachings, support, and, guide, one, s, practice, hori, writes, that, modern, rinzai, zen, teachers, do, not, teach, that, intellectual, understanding, has, nothing, to, do, with, zen, instead, they, teach, the, quite, opposite, lesson, that, zen, requires, intellectual, understanding, and, literary, study, since, the, emphasis, is, generally, on, a, balanced, approach, to, study, and, practice, the, extremes, which, reject, either, pole, are, seen, as, problematic, by, most, zen, traditions, as, hori, writes, referring, to, the, attitude, of, the, modern, rinzai, school, the, intellectual, understanding, of, zen, and, the, experience, itself, are, presented, as, standing, in, a, complementary, both, and, relationship, as, such, it, is, said, that, the, master, of, zen, uses, two, swords, the, study, of, the, teaching, kyoso, and, the, experience, of, the, way, doriki, the, early, buddhist, schools, in, china, were, each, based, on, a, specific, sutra, at, the, beginning, of, the, tang, dynasty, by, the, time, of, the, fifth, patriarch, hongren, 601, 674, the, zen, school, became, established, as, a, separate, school, of, buddhism, and, began, to, develop, its, doctrinal, position, based, on, the, scriptures, various, sutras, were, used, by, the, early, zen, tradition, even, before, the, time, of, hongren, they, include, the, r, m, l, dev, s, tra, huike, awakening, of, faith, daoxin, the, lankavatara, sutra, east, mountain, school, the, diamond, sutra, shenhui, and, the, platform, sutra, a, chinese, composition, the, chan, tradition, drew, inspiration, from, a, variety, of, scriptural, sources, and, did, not, follow, any, single, scripture, over, the, others, subsequently, the, zen, tradition, produced, a, rich, corpus, of, written, literature, which, has, become, a, part, of, its, practice, and, teaching, other, influential, sutras, in, zen, are, the, vimalakirti, sutra, avatamsaka, sutra, the, shurangama, sutra, and, the, mahaparinirvana, sutra, important, apocryphal, sutras, composed, in, china, include, the, sutra, of, perfect, enlightenment, and, the, vajrasamadhi, sutra, in, his, analysis, of, the, works, of, the, influential, tang, dynasty, hongzhou, school, mario, poceski, notes, that, they, cite, the, following, mahayana, sutras, often, the, lotus, sutra, the, huayan, the, nirvana, the, la, k, vat, ra, the, praj, p, ramit, sutras, the, mah, ratnak, ta, the, mah, samnip, ta, and, the, vimalak, rti, zen, developed, a, rich, textual, tradition, based, on, original, zen, writings, such, as, poems, dialogues, histories, and, the, recorded, sayings, of, zen, masters, important, zen, texts, and, genres, include, the, history, of, ch, n, in, china, is, divided, into, various, periods, by, different, scholars, who, generally, distinguish, a, classical, phase, and, a, post, classical, period, each, period, had, different, schools, of, zen, some, of, which, remained, influential, while, others, vanished, ferguson, distinguishes, three, periods, from, the, 5th, century, into, the, 13th, century, the, legendary, period, of, the, six, patriarchs, 5th, century, to, the, 760s, bce, the, classical, period, of, the, hongzhou, masters, 760s, to, 950, and, the, literary, period, 950, 1250, of, song, dynasty, chan, which, saw, the, compilation, of, the, gongan, collections, and, the, rise, of, linji, and, caodong, mcrae, distinguishes, four, rough, phases, in, the, history, of, ch, n, though, he, notes, this, is, only, an, expedient, device, and, the, reality, was, much, more, complicated, neither, ferguson, nor, mcrae, give, a, periodisation, for, chinese, ch, n, following, the, song, dynasty, though, mcrae, mentions, at, least, a, post, classical, phase, or, perhaps, multiple, phases, david, mcmahan, discusses, the, later, ming, 1368, 1644, and, qing, 1644, 1912, era, of, chan, which, saw, increasing, syncretism, with, other, traditions, and, a, later, modern, phase, 19th, century, onwards, during, which, chan, adapted, western, ideas, and, attempted, to, modernize, in, response, to, the, pressure, of, foreign, imperialism, before, the, arrival, of, the, founder, of, chan, bodhidharma, various, buddhist, masters, of, meditation, or, dhyana, ch, channa, had, taught, in, china, including, an, shigao, and, buddhabhadra, these, figures, also, brought, with, them, various, meditation, texts, called, the, dhy, na, sutras, which, mainly, drew, from, the, teachings, of, the, sarv, stiv, da, these, early, meditation, texts, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, practices, of, chan, buddhism, the, translation, work, of, kum, raj, va, especially, his, praj, p, ramit, translations, and, his, vimalakirti, sutra, buddhabhadra, avatamsaka, sutra, and, gunabhadra, lank, vat, ra, s, tra, were, also, key, formative, influences, on, chan, and, remained, key, sources, for, later, chan, masters, indeed, in, some, early, chan, texts, like, the, masters, of, the, lank, vat, ra, it, is, gunabhadra, not, bodhidharma, which, is, seen, as, the, first, patriarch, who, transmits, the, chan, lineage, here, seen, as, synonymous, with, the, lank, vat, ra, tradition, from, india, the, meditation, works, of, the, fourth, tiantai, patriarch, zhiyi, such, as, his, monumental, mohezhiguan, were, also, influential, on, later, chan, meditation, manuals, like, the, tso, chan, i, a, further, influence, on, the, origin, of, chan, buddhism, is, taoism, some, of, the, earliest, chinese, buddhists, were, influenced, by, daoist, thought, and, terminology, and, this, has, led, some, scholars, to, see, a, taoist, influence, on, chan, two, chinese, disciples, of, kum, raj, va, sengzhao, and, tao, sheng, were, influenced, by, taoist, works, like, the, laozi, and, zhuangzi, these, sanlun, figures, in, turn, had, an, influence, on, some, early, chan, masters, when, buddhism, came, to, china, from, gandhara, now, afghanistan, and, india, it, was, initially, adapted, to, the, chinese, culture, and, understanding, buddhism, was, exposed, to, confucianist, and, taoist, influences, buddhism, was, first, identified, to, be, a, barbarian, variant, of, taoism, judging, from, the, reception, by, the, han, of, the, hinayana, works, and, from, the, early, commentaries, it, appears, that, buddhism, was, being, perceived, and, digested, through, the, medium, of, religious, taoism, buddha, was, seen, as, a, foreign, immortal, who, had, achieved, some, form, of, daoist, nondeath, the, buddhists, mindfulness, of, the, breath, was, regarded, as, an, extension, of, daoist, breathing, exercises, taoist, terminology, was, used, to, express, buddhist, doctrines, in, the, oldest, translations, of, buddhist, texts, a, practice, termed, ko, i, matching, the, concepts, the, first, buddhist, recruits, in, china, were, taoists, they, developed, high, esteem, for, the, newly, introduced, buddhist, meditational, techniques, and, blended, them, with, taoist, meditation, against, this, background, especially, the, taoist, concept, of, naturalness, was, inherited, by, the, early, ch, n, disciples, they, equated, to, some, extent, the, ineffable, tao, and, buddha, nature, and, thus, rather, than, feeling, bound, to, the, abstract, wisdom, of, the, s, tras, emphasized, buddha, nature, to, be, found, in, everyday, human, life, just, like, the, tao, proto, ch, n, c, 500, 600, encompasses, the, southern, and, northern, dynasties, period, 420, to, 589, and, sui, dynasty, 589, 618, ce, this, is, the, time, of, the, first, patriarchs, of, chan, like, bodhidharma, seng, fu, and, huike, there, is, little, actual, historical, information, about, these, early, figures, and, most, legendary, stories, about, their, life, come, from, later, mostly, tang, sources, what, is, known, is, that, they, were, considered, mahayana, meditation, masters, chanshi, an, important, text, from, this, period, is, the, two, entrances, and, four, practices, found, in, dunhuang, and, attributed, to, bodhidharma, later, sources, mention, that, these, figures, taught, using, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, though, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, this, from, the, earliest, sources, according, to, john, mcrae, the, earliest, chan, sources, on, these, masters, show, considerable, influence, from, madhyamaka, thought, while, the, influence, from, the, la, k, vat, ra, is, actually, much, less, pronounced, as, such, it, is, questionable, if, it, was, there, at, all, with, regards, to, the, earliest, figures, like, bodhidharma, and, huike, early, ch, n, refers, to, early, tang, dynasty, 618, 750, ch, n, the, fifth, patriarch, daman, hongren, 601, 674, and, his, dharma, heir, yuquan, shenxiu, 606, 706, were, influential, in, founding, the, first, chan, institution, in, chinese, history, known, as, the, east, mountain, school, hongren, emphasized, the, meditation, practice, of, maintaining, guarding, the, mind, which, focuses, on, an, awareness, of, true, mind, or, buddha, nature, within, shenxiu, was, the, most, influential, and, charismatic, student, of, hongren, and, was, considered, to, be, the, sixth, patriarch, by, his, followers, he, was, even, invited, to, the, imperial, court, by, empress, wu, shenxiu, also, became, the, target, of, much, criticism, by, shenhui, 670, 762, for, his, supposedly, gradualist, teachings, shenhui, instead, promoted, the, sudden, teachings, attributed, to, his, teacher, huineng, 638, 713, shenhui, s, propaganda, campaign, eventually, succeeded, when, he, became, a, key, figure, in, the, royal, court, elevating, huineng, to, the, status, of, sixth, patriarch, of, chinese, ch, n, this, sudden, vs, gradual, debate, came, to, define, later, forms, of, chan, discourse, this, early, period, also, saw, the, composition, of, the, platform, sutra, which, would, become, one, of, the, most, influential, chan, texts, of, all, time, the, sutra, purports, to, contain, the, teachings, of, the, sixth, patriarch, huineng, but, modern, scholars, like, yanagida, seizan, now, believe, that, it, was, redacted, over, a, period, of, time, within, the, oxhead, school, according, to, mcrae, the, text, attempts, to, reconcile, the, so, called, sudden, teachings, with, the, gradual, teachings, of, the, northern, school, the, middle, ch, n, c, 750, 1000, phase, runs, from, the, an, lushan, rebellion, 755, 763, to, the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, period, 907, 960, 979, this, period, saw, the, rise, of, chan, schools, in, rural, southern, china, the, most, prominent, among, them, was, the, hongzhou, school, of, mazu, daoyi, 709, 788, which, arose, in, hunan, and, jiangxi, other, important, hongzhou, masters, include, shitou, baizhang, and, huangbo, this, school, is, sometimes, seen, as, the, archetypal, expression, of, ch, n, with, its, emphasis, on, the, personal, expression, of, the, buddha, mind, in, everyday, life, activities, its, use, of, slang, and, chinese, vernacular, as, opposed, to, classical, chinese, as, well, as, the, importance, it, placed, on, spontaneous, and, unconventional, questions, and, answers, during, an, encounter, linji, wenda, between, master, and, disciple, this, period, also, sees, the, first, chan, monastic, code, the, pure, rules, of, baizhang, some, sources, depict, these, masters, as, highly, antinomian, and, iconoclastic, people, who, make, paradoxical, or, nonsensical, statements, shout, at, and, beat, their, students, to, shock, them, into, realization, however, modern, scholars, have, seen, much, of, the, literature, that, presents, these, iconoclastic, encounters, as, being, later, revisions, during, the, song, era, the, hongzhou, masters, may, not, have, been, as, radical, as, the, song, sources, depict, them, to, be, and, they, seem, to, have, promoted, traditional, buddhist, practices, like, keeping, precepts, accumulating, good, karma, and, practicing, meditation, there, were, other, important, schools, of, zen, in, this, period, as, well, such, as, the, j, ngzh, ng, school, of, zhishen, 609, 702, and, kim, hwasang, which, was, based,

for, all, schools, of, metropolitan, chinese, buddhism, but, the, chan, tradition, survived, in, the, rural, areas, and, in, the, outlying, regions, chan, was, thus, in, a, position, to, take, a, leading, role, in, the, later, eras, of, chinese, buddhism, during, the, subsequent, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, era, the, hongzhou, school, gradually, split, into, several, regional,
