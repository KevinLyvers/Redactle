modern, english, word, heaven, is, derived, from, the, earlier, middle, english, heven, attested, 1159, this, in, turn, was, developed, from, the, previous, old, english, form, heofon, by, about, 1000, heofon, was, being, used, in, reference, to, the, christianized, place, where, god, dwells, but, originally, it, had, signified, sky, firmament, e, g, in, beowulf, c, 725, the, english, term, has, cognates, in, the, other, germanic, languages, old, saxon, he, an, sky, heaven, hence, also, middle, low, german, heven, sky, old, icelandic, himinn, gothic, himins, and, those, with, a, variant,

all, of, these, have, been, derived, from, a, reconstructed, proto, germanic, form, hemina, or, hem, the, further, derivation, of, this, form, is, uncertain, a, connection, to, proto, indo, european, em, cover, shroud, via, a, reconstructed, k, emen, or, k, men, stone, heaven, has, been, proposed, others, endorse, the, derivation, from, a, proto, indo, european, root, h, m, stone, and, possibly,

and, sanskrit, a, man, stone, rock, sling, stone, thunderbolt, the, firmament, in, the, latter, case, english, hammer, would, be, another, cognate, to, the, word, the, ancient, mesopotamians, regarded, the, sky, as, a, series, of, domes, usually, three, but, sometimes, seven, covering, the, flat, earth, each, dome, was, made, of, a, different, kind, of, precious, stone, the, lowest, dome, of, heaven, was, made, of, jasper, and, was, the, home, of, the, stars, the, middle, dome, of, heaven, was, made, of, saggilmut, stone, and, was, the, abode, of, the, igigi, the, highest, and, outermost, dome, of, heaven, was, made, of, lulud, n, tu, stone, and, was, personified, as, an, the, god, of, the, sky, the, celestial, bodies, were, equated, with, specific, deities, as, well, the, planet, venus, was, believed, to, be, inanna, the, goddess, of, sex, and, war, the, sun, was, her, brother, utu, the, god, of, justice, and, the, moon, was, their, father, nanna, in, ancient, near, eastern, cultures, in, general, and, in, mesopotamia, in, particular, humans, had, little, to, no, access, to, the, divine, realm, heaven, and, earth, were, separated, by, their, very, nature, humans, could, see, and, be, affected, by, elements, of, the, lower, heaven, such, as, stars, and, storms, but, ordinary, mortals, could, not, go, to, heaven, because, it, was, the, abode, of, the, gods, alone, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, gilgamesh, says, to, enkidu, who, can, go, up, to, heaven, my, friend, only, the, gods, dwell, with, shamash, forever, instead, after, a, person, died, his, or, her, soul, went, to, kur, later, known, as, irkalla, a, dark, shadowy, underworld, located, deep, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, all, souls, went, to, the, same, afterlife, and, a, person, s, actions, during, life, had, no, impact, on, how, he, would, be, treated, in, the, world, to, come, nonetheless, funerary, evidence, indicates, that, some, people, believed, that, inanna, had, the, power, to, bestow, special, favors, upon, her, devotees, in, the, afterlife, despite, the, separation, between, heaven, and, earth, humans, sought, access, to, the, gods, through, oracles, and, omens, the, gods, were, believed, to, live, in, heaven, but, also, in, their, temples, which, were, seen, as, the, channels, of, communication, between, earth, and, heaven, which, allowed, mortal, access, to, the, gods, the, ekur, temple, in, nippur, was, known, as, the, dur, an, ki, the, mooring, rope, of, heaven, and, earth, it, was, widely, thought, to, have, been, built, and, established, by, enlil, himself, the, ancient, hittites, believed, that, some, deities, lived, in, heaven, while, others, lived, in, remote, places, on, earth, such, as, mountains, where, humans, had, little, access, in, the, middle, hittite, myths, heaven, is, the, abode, of, the, gods, in, the, song, of, kumarbi, alalu, was, king, in, heaven, for, nine, years, before, giving, birth, to, his, son, anu, anu, was, himself, overthrown, by, his, son, kumarbi, almost, nothing, is, known, of, bronze, age, pre, 1200, bc, canaanite, views, of, heaven, and, the, archaeological, findings, at, ugarit, destroyed, c, 1200, bc, have, not, provided, information, the, first, century, greek, author, philo, of, byblos, may, have, preserved, elements, of, iron, age, phoenician, religion, in, his, sanchuniathon, zoroaster, the, zoroastrian, prophet, who, introduced, the, gathas, spoke, of, the, existence, of, heaven, and, hell, historically, the, unique, features, of, zoroastrianism, such, as, its, conception, of, heaven, hell, angels, monotheism, belief, in, free, will, and, the, day, of, judgement, among, other, concepts, may, have, influenced, other, religious, and, philosophical, systems, including, the, abrahamic, religions, gnosticism, northern, buddhism, and, greek, philosophy, as, in, other, ancient, near, eastern, cultures, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, universe, is, commonly, divided, into, two, realms, heaven, mayim, and, earth, ere, sometimes, a, third, realm, is, added, either, sea, water, under, the, earth, or, sometimes, a, vague, land, of, the, dead, that, is, never, described, in, depth, the, structure, of, heaven, itself, is, not, fully, described, in, the, hebrew, bible, but, the, fact, that, the, hebrew, word, mayim, is, plural, has, been, interpreted, by, scholars, as, an, indication, that, the, ancient, israelites, envisioned, the, heavens, as, having, multiple, layers, much, like, the, ancient, mesopotamians, this, reading, is, also, supported, by, the, use, of, the, phrase, heaven, of, heavens, in, verses, such, as, deuteronomy, 10, 14, 1, kings, 8, 27, and, 2, chronicles, 2, 6, in, line, with, the, typical, view, of, most, near, eastern, cultures, the, hebrew, bible, depicts, heaven, as, a, place, that, is, inaccessible, to, humans, although, some, prophets, are, occasionally, granted, temporary, visionary, access, to, heaven, such, as, in, 1, kings, 22, 19, 23, job, 1, 6, 12, and, 2, 1, 6, and, isaiah, 6, they, hear, only, god, s, deliberations, concerning, the, earth, and, learn, nothing, of, what, heaven, is, like, there, is, almost, no, mention, in, the, hebrew, bible, of, heaven, as, a, possible, afterlife, destination, for, human, beings, who, are, instead, described, as, resting, in, sheol, the, only, two, possible, exceptions, to, this, are, enoch, who, is, described, in, genesis, 5, 24, as, having, been, taken, by, god, and, the, prophet, elijah, who, is, described, in, 2, kings, 2, 11, as, having, ascended, to, heaven, in, a, chariot, of, fire, according, to, michael, b, hundley, the, text, in, both, of, these, instances, is, ambiguous, regarding, the, significance, of, the, actions, being, described, and, in, neither, of, these, cases, does, the, text, explain, what, happened, to, the, subject, afterwards, the, god, of, the, israelites, is, described, as, ruling, both, heaven, and, earth, other, passages, such, as, 1, kings, 8, 27, state, that, even, the, vastness, of, heaven, cannot, contain, god, s, majesty, a, number, of, passages, throughout, the, hebrew, bible, indicate, that, heaven, and, earth, will, one, day, come, to, an, end, this, view, is, paralleled, in, other, ancient, near, eastern, cultures, which, also, regarded, heaven, and, earth, as, vulnerable, and, subject, to, dissolution, however, the, hebrew, bible, differs, from, other, ancient, near, eastern, cultures, in, that, it, portrays, the, god, of, israel, as, independent, of, creation, and, unthreatened, by, its, potential, destruction, because, most, of, the, hebrew, bible, concerns, the, god, of, israel, s, relationship, with, his, people, most, of, the, events, described, in, it, take, place, on, earth, not, in, heaven, the, deuteronomistic, source, deuteronomistic, history, and, priestly, source, all, portray, the, temple, in, jerusalem, as, the, sole, channel, of, communication, between, earth, and, heaven, during, the, period, of, the, second, temple, c, 515, bc, 70, ad, the, hebrew, people, lived, under, the, rule, of, first, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, then, the, greek, kingdoms, of, the, diadochi, and, finally, the, roman, empire, their, culture, was, profoundly, influenced, by, those, of, the, peoples, who, ruled, them, consequently, their, views, on, existence, after, death, were, profoundly, shaped, by, the, ideas, of, the, persians, greeks, and, romans, the, idea, of, the, immortality, of, the, soul, is, derived, from, greek, philosophy, and, the, idea, of, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, is, thought, to, be, derived, from, persian, cosmology, although, the, later, claim, has, been, recently, questioned, by, the, early, first, century, ad, these, two, seemingly, incompatible, ideas, were, often, conflated, by, hebrew, thinkers, the, hebrews, also, inherited, from, the, persians, greeks, and, romans, the, idea, that, the, human, soul, originates, in, the, divine, realm, and, seeks, to, return, there, the, idea, that, a, human, soul, belongs, in, heaven, and, that, earth, is, merely, a, temporary, abode, in, which, the, soul, is, tested, to, prove, its, worthiness, became, increasingly, popular, during, the, hellenistic, period, 323, 31, bc, gradually, some, hebrews, began, to, adopt, the, idea, of, heaven, as, the, eternal, home, of, the, righteous, dead, descriptions, of, heaven, in, the, new, testament, are, more, fully, developed, than, those, in, the, old, testament, but, are, still, generally, vague, as, in, the, old, testament, in, the, new, testament, god, is, described, as, the, ruler, of, heaven, and, earth, but, his, power, over, the, earth, is, challenged, by, satan, the, gospels, of, mark, and, luke, speak, of, the, kingdom, of, god, greek, basile, a, tou, theou, while, the, gospel, of, matthew, more, commonly, uses, the, term, kingdom, of, heaven, greek, basile, a, t, n, ouran, n, both, phrases, are, thought, to, have, the, same, meaning, but, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, matthew, changed, the, name, kingdom, of, god, to, kingdom, of, heaven, in, most, instances, because, it, was, the, more, acceptable, phrase, in, his, own, cultural, and, religious, context, in, the, late, first, century, modern, scholars, agree, that, the, kingdom, of, god, was, an, essential, part, of, the, teachings, of, the, historical, jesus, but, there, is, no, agreement, on, what, this, kingdom, was, none, of, the, gospels, record, jesus, as, having, explained, exactly, what, the, phrase, kingdom, of, god, means, the, most, likely, explanation, for, this, apparent, omission, is, that, the, kingdom, of, god, was, a, commonly, understood, concept, that, required, no, explanation, according, to, sanders, and, casey, jews, in, judea, during, the, early, first, century, believed, that, god, reigns, eternally, in, heaven, but, many, also, believed, that, god, would, eventually, establish, his, kingdom, on, earth, as, well, because, god, s, kingdom, was, believed, to, be, superior, to, any, human, kingdom, this, meant, that, god, would, necessarily, drive, out, the, romans, who, ruled, judea, and, establish, his, own, direct, rule, over, the, jewish, people, this, belief, is, referenced, in, the, first, petition, of, the, lord, s, prayer, taught, by, jesus, to, his, disciples, and, recorded, in, matthew, and, luke, 11, 2, your, kingdom, come, your, will, be, done, on, earth, as, it, is, in, heaven, other, scholars, contend, that, jesus, teaching, of, the, kingdom, of, god, was, of, something, that, is, present, but, also, still, yet, to, come, for, instance, wright, points, to, the, synoptic, gospels, that, jesus, death, and, resurrection, was, anticipated, as, the, climax, and, fulfillment, of, his, kingdom, of, god, messages, and, that, his, combined, prophecy, about, the, temple, s, doom, through, apocalyptic, language, would, serve, as, his, vindication, the, synoptic, gospels, and, pauline, epistles, portray, jesus, as, believing, his, death, and, resurrection, would, complete, the, work, of, inaugurating, the, kingdom, of, god, and, that, his, followers, who, wrote, everything, down, expressed, their, belief, he, had, done, so, using, first, century, jewish, idioms, and, that, such, events, did, with, evil, and, launch, the, project, of, new, creation, in, the, teachings, of, the, historical, jesus, people, are, expected, to, prepare, for, the, coming, of, the, kingdom, of, god, by, living, moral, lives, jesus, s, commands, for, his, followers, to, adopt, lifestyles, of, moral, perfectionism, are, found, in, many, passages, throughout, the, synoptic, gospels, particularly, in, the, sermon, on, the, mount, in, matthew, 5, 7, jesus, also, taught, that, in, the, kingdom, of, heaven, there, would, be, a, reversal, of, roles, in, which, the, last, will, be, first, and, the, first, will, be, last, this, teaching, recurs, throughout, the, recorded, teachings, of, jesus, including, in, the, admonition, to, be, like, a, child, the, parable, of, the, rich, man, and, lazarus, in, luke, 16, the, parable, of, the, workers, in, the, vineyard, in, matthew, 20, the, parable, of, the, great, banquet, in, matthew, 22, and, the, parable, of, the, prodigal, son, in, luke, 15, traditionally, christianity, has, taught, that, heaven, is, the, location, of, the, throne, of, god, as, well, as, the, holy, angels, although, this, is, in, varying, degrees, considered, metaphorical, in, traditional, christianity, it, is, considered, a, state, or, condition, of, existence, rather, than, a, particular, place, somewhere, in, the, cosmos, of, the, supreme, fulfillment, of, theosis, in, the, beatific, vision, of, the, godhead, in, most, forms, of, christianity, heaven, is, also, understood, as, the, abode, for, the, redeemed, dead, in, the, afterlife, usually, a, temporary, stage, before, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, the, saints, return, to, the, new, earth, the, resurrected, jesus, is, said, to, have, ascended, to, heaven, where, he, now, sits, at, the, right, hand, of, god, and, will, return, to, earth, in, the, second, coming, various, people, have, been, said, to, have, entered, heaven, while, still, alive, including, enoch, elijah, and, jesus, after, his, resurrection, according, to, roman, catholic, teaching, mary, mother, of, jesus, is, also, said, to, have, been, assumed, into, heaven, and, is, titled, the, queen, of, heaven, in, the, second, century, ad, irenaeus, of, lyons, recorded, a, belief, that, in, accordance, with, john, 14, those, who, in, the, afterlife, see, the, saviour, are, in, different, mansions, some, dwelling, in, the, heavens, others, in, paradise, and, others, in, the, city, while, the, word, used, in, all, these, writings, in, particular, the, new, testament, greek, word, ouranos, applies, primarily, to, the, sky, it, is, also, used, metaphorically, of, the, dwelling, place, of, god, and, the, blessed, similarly, though, the, english, word, heaven, keeps, its, original, physical, meaning, when, used, for, instance, in, allusions, to, the, stars, as, lights, shining, through, from, heaven, and, in, phrases, such, as, heavenly, body, to, mean, an, astronomical, object, the, heaven, or, happiness, that, christianity, looks, forward, to, is, according, to, pope, john, paul, ii, neither, an, abstraction, nor, a, physical, place, in, the, clouds, but, a, living, personal, relationship, with, the, holy, trinity, it, is, our, meeting, with, the, father, which, takes, place, in, the, risen, christ, through, the, communion, of, the, holy, spirit, while, the, concept, of, heaven, malkuth, hashamaim, the, kingdom, of, heaven, is, much, discussed, in, christian, thought, the, jewish, concept, of, the, afterlife, sometimes, known, as, olam, haba, the, world, to, come, is, not, discussed, as, often, the, torah, has, little, to, say, on, the, subject, of, survival, after, death, but, by, the, time, of, the, rabbis, two, ideas, had, made, inroads, among, the, jews, one, which, is, probably, derived, from, greek, thought, is, that, of, the, immortal, soul, which, returns, to, its, creator, after, death, the, other, which, is, thought, to, be, of, persian, origin, is, that, of, resurrection, of, the, dead, jewish, writings, refer, to, a, new, earth, as, the, abode, of, mankind, following, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, originally, the, two, ideas, of, immortality, and, resurrection, were, different, but, in, rabbinic, thought, they, are, combined, the, soul, departs, from, the, body, at, death, but, is, returned, to, it, at, the, resurrection, this, idea, is, linked, to, another, rabbinic, teaching, that, men, s, good, and, bad, actions, are, rewarded, and, punished, not, in, this, life, but, after, death, whether, immediately, or, at, the, subsequent, resurrection, around, 1, ce, the, pharisees, believed, in, an, afterlife, but, the, sadducees, did, not, the, mishnah, has, many, sayings, about, the, world, to, come, for, example, rabbi, yaakov, said, this, world, is, like, a, lobby, before, the, world, to, come, prepare, yourself, in, the, lobby, so, that, you, may, enter, the, banquet, hall, judaism, holds, that, the, righteous, of, all, nations, have, a, share, in, the, world, to, come, according, to, nicholas, de, lange, judaism, offers, no, clear, teaching, about, the, destiny, which, lies, in, wait, for, the, individual, after, death, and, its, attitude, to, life, after, death, has, been, expressed, as, follows, for, the, future, is, inscrutable, and, the, accepted, sources, of, knowledge, whether, experience, or, reason, or, revelation, offer, no, clear, guidance, about, what, is, to, come, the, only, certainty, is, that, each, man, must, die, beyond, that, we, can, only, guess, similar, to, jewish, traditions, such, as, the, talmud, the, qur, an, and, hadith, frequently, mention, the, existence, of, seven, sam, w, t, the, plural, of, sam, meaning, heaven, sky, celestial, sphere, and, cognate, with, hebrew, sham, yim, some, of, the, verses, in, the, qur, an, mentioning, the, samaawat, are, 41, 12, 65, 12, and, 71, 15, sidrat, al, muntaha, a, large, enigmatic, lote, tree, marks, the, end, of, the, seventh, heaven, and, the, utmost, extremity, for, all, of, god, s, creatures, and, heavenly, knowledge, one, interpretation, of, heavens, is, that, all, the, stars, and, galaxies, including, the, milky, way, are, part, of, the, first, heaven, and, beyond, that, six, still, bigger, worlds, are, there, which, have, yet, to, be, discovered, by, scientists, according, to, shi, ite, sources, ali, mentioned, the, names, of, the, seven, heavens, as, below, still, an, afterlife, destination, of, the, righteous, is, conceived, in, islam, as, jannah, arabic, garden, translated, as, paradise, regarding, eden, or, paradise, the, quran, says, the, description, of, the, paradise, promised, to, the, righteous, is, that, under, it, rivers, flow, eternal, is, its, fruit, as, well, as, its, shade, that, is, the, ultimate, outcome, for, the, righteous, but, the, outcome, for, the, disbelievers, is, the, fire, islam, rejects, the, concept, of, original, sin, and, muslims, believe, that, all, human, beings, are, born, pure, children, automatically, go, to, paradise, when, they, die, regardless, of, the, religion, of, their, parents, paradise, is, described, primarily, in, physical, terms, as, a, place, where, every, wish, is, immediately, fulfilled, when, asked, islamic, texts, describe, immortal, life, in, jannah, as, happy, without, negative, emotions, those, who, dwell, in, jannah, are, said, to, wear, costly, apparel, partake, in, exquisite, banquets, and, recline, on, couches, inlaid, with, gold, or, precious, stones, inhabitants, will, rejoice, in, the, company, of, their, parents, spouses, and, children, in, islam, if, one, s, good, deeds, outweigh, one, s, sins, then, one, may, gain, entrance, to, paradise, only, through, god, s, mercy, conversely, if, one, s, sins, outweigh, their, good, deeds, they, are, sent, to, hell, the, more, good, deeds, one, has, performed, the, higher, the, level, of, jannah, one, is, directed, to, quran, verses, which, describe, paradise, include, 13, 15, 18, 31, 38, 49, 54, 35, 33, 35, and, 52, 17,

metaphorical, they, propound, the, verse, which, describes, according, to, them, how, the, life, to, come, after, death, is, different, from, the, life, on, earth, the, quran, says, from, bringing, in, your, place, others, like, you, and, from, developing, you, into, a, form, which, at, present, you, know, not, according, to, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, the, founder, of, the, ahmadiyya, sect, in, islam, the, soul, will, give, birth, to, another, rarer, entity, and, will, resemble, the, life, on, earth, in, the, sense, that, this, entity, will, bear, a, similar, relationship, to, the, soul, as,

living, in, and, ruling, these, heavens, most, important, of, these, heavens, was, omeyocan, place, of, two, the, thirteen, heavens, were, ruled, by, ometeotl, the, dual, lord, creator, of, the, dual,

of, the, heavens, and, the, underworld, these, differ, from, one, island, to, another, what, they, share, is, the, view, of, the, universe, as, an, egg, or, coconut, that, is, divided, between, the, world, of, humans, earth, the, upper, world, of, heavenly, gods, and, the, underworld, each, of, these, is, subdivided, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, dante, s, divine, comedy, but, the, number, of, divisions, and, their, names, differs, from, one, polynesian, culture, to, another, in, m, ori, mythology, the, heavens, are, divided, into, a, number, of, realms, different, tribes, number, the, heaven, differently, with, as, few, as, two, and, as, many, as, fourteen, levels, one, of, the, more, common, versions, divides, heaven, thus, the, m, ori, believe, these, heavens, are, supported, by, pillars, other, polynesian, peoples, see, them, being, supported, by, gods, as, in, hawaii, in, one, tahitian, legend, heaven, is, supported, by, an, octopus, the, polynesian, conception, of, the, universe, and, its, division, is, nicely, illustrated, by, a, famous, drawing, made, by, a, tuomotuan, chief, in, 1869, here, the, nine, heavens, are, further, divided, into, left, and, right, and, each, stage, is, associated, with, a, stage, in, the, evolution, of, the, earth, that, is, portrayed, below, the, lowest, division, represents, a, period, when, the, heavens, hung, low, over, the, earth, which, was, inhabited, by, animals, that, were, not, known, to, the, islanders, in, the, third, division, is, shown, the, first, murder, the, first, burials, and, the, first, canoes, built, by, rata, in, the, fourth, division, the, first, coconut, tree, and, other, significant, plants, are, born, it, is, believed, in, theosophy, founded, mainly, by, helena, blavatsky, that, each, religion, including, theosophy, has, its, own, individual, heaven, in, various, regions, of, the, upper, astral, plane, that, fits, the, description, of, that, heaven, that, is, given, in, each, religion, to, which, a, soul, that, has, been, good, in, their, previous, life, on, earth, will, go, the, area, of, the, upper, astral, plane, of, earth, in, the, upper, atmosphere, where, the, various, heavens, are, located, is, called, summerland, theosophists, believe, hell, is, located, in, the, lower, astral, plane, of, earth, which, extends, downward, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, to, its, center, however, theosophists, believe, that, the, soul, is, recalled, back, to, earth, after, an, average, of, about, 1400, years, by, the, lords, of, karma, to, incarnate, again, the, final, heaven, that, souls, go, to, billions, of, years, in, the, future, after, they, finish, their, cycle, of, incarnations, is, called, devachan, anarchist, emma, goldman, expressed, this, view, when, she, wrote, consciously, or, unconsciously, most, theists, see, in, gods, and, devils, heaven, and, hell, reward, and, punishment, a, whip, to, lash, the, people, into, obedience, meekness, and, contentment, some, have, argued, that, a, belief, in, a, reward, after, death, is, poor, motivation, for, moral, behavior, while, alive, sam, harris, wrote, it, is, rather, more, noble, to, help, people, purely, out, of, concern, for, their, suffering, than, it, is, to, help, them, because, you, think, the, creator, of, the, universe, wants, you, to, do, it, or, will, reward, you, for, doing, it, or, will, punish, you, for, not, doing, it, the, problem, with, this, linkage, between, religion, and, morality, is, that, it, gives, people, bad, reasons, to, help, other, human, beings, when, good, reasons, are, available, many, neuroscientists, and, neurophilosophers, such, as, daniel, dennett, believe, that, consciousness, is, dependent, upon, the, functioning, of, the, brain, and, death, is, a, cessation, of, consciousness, which, would, rule, out, heaven, scientific, research, has, discovered, that, some, areas, of, the, brain, like, the, reticular, activating, system, or, the, thalamus, appear, to, be, necessary, for, consciousness, because, dysfunction, of, or, damage, to, these, structures, causes, a, loss, of, consciousness, in, inside, the, neolithic, mind, 2005, lewis, williams, and, pearce, argue, that, many, cultures, around, the, world, and, through, history, neurally, perceive, a, tiered, structure, of, heaven, along, with, similarly, structured, circles, of, hell, the, reports, match, so, similarly, across, time, and, space, that, lewis, williams, and, pearce, argue, for, a, neuroscientific, explanation, accepting, the, percepts, as, real, neural, activations, and, subjective, percepts, during, particular, altered, states, of, consciousness, many, people, who, come, close, to, death, and, have, near, death, experiences, report, meeting, relatives, or, entering, the, light, in, an, otherworldly, dimension, which, shares, similarities, with, the, religious, concept, of, heaven, even, though, there, are, also, reports, of, distressing, experiences, and, negative, life, reviews, which, share, some, similarities, with, the, concept, of, hell, the, positive, experience, of, meeting, or, entering, the, light, is, reported, as, an, immensely, intense,
