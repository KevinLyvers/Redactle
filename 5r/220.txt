baptists, are, a, branch, of, christianity, distinguished, by, baptizing, only, professing, christian, believers, believer, s, baptism, and, doing, so, by, complete, immersion, baptist, churches, generally, subscribe, to, the, doctrines, of, soul, competency, the, responsibility, and, accountability, of, every, person, before, god, sola, fide, salvation, by, just, faith, alone, sola, scriptura, the, scripture, of, the, bible, alone, as, the, rule, of, faith, and, practice, and, congregationalist, church, government, baptists, generally, recognize, two, ordinances, baptism, and, communion, diverse, from, their, beginning, those, identifying, as, baptists, today, may, differ, widely, from, one, another, in, what, they, believe, how, they, worship, their, attitudes, toward, other, christians, and, their, understanding, of, what, is, important, in, christian, discipleship, baptist, missionaries, have, spread, various, baptist, churches, to, every, continent, the, largest, group, of, baptist, churches, is, the, baptist, world, alliance, and, there, are, many, different, groupings, of, baptist, churches, and, baptist, congregations, historians, trace, the, earliest, baptist, church, to, 1609, in, amsterdam, with, english, separatist, john, smyth, as, its, pastor, in, accordance, with, his, reading, of, the, new, testament, he, rejected, baptism, of, infants, and, instituted, baptism, only, of, believing, adults, baptist, practice, spread, to, england, where, the, general, baptists, considered, christ, s, atonement, to, extend, to, all, people, while, the, particular, baptists, believed, that, it, extended, only, to, the, elect, thomas, helwys, formulated, a, distinctively, baptist, request, that, the, church, and, the, state, be, kept, separate, in, matters, of, law, so, that, individuals, might, have, freedom, of, religion, helwys, died, in, prison, as, a, consequence, of, the, religious, conflict, with, english, dissenters, under, james, i, baptist, historian, bruce, gourley, outlines, four, main, views, of, baptist, origins, modern, baptist, churches, trace, their, history, to, the, english, separatist, movement, in, the, 17th, century, over, a, century, after, the, foundation, of, the, church, of, england, during, the, protestant, reformation, this, view, of, baptist, origins, has, the, most, historical, support, and, is, the, most, widely, accepted, adherents, to, this, position, consider, the, influence, of, anabaptists, upon, early, baptists, to, be, minimal, it, was, a, time, of, considerable, political, and, religious, turmoil, both, individuals, and, churches, were, willing, to, give, up, their, theological, roots, if, they, became, convinced, that, a, more, biblical, truth, had, been, discovered, during, the, reformation, the, church, of, england, anglicans, separated, from, the, roman, catholic, church, there, were, some, christians, who, were, not, content, with, the, achievements, of, the, mainstream, protestant, reformation, there, also, were, christians, who, were, disappointed, that, the, church, of, england, had, not, made, corrections, of, what, some, considered, to, be, errors, and, abuses, of, those, most, critical, of, the, church, s, direction, some, chose, to, stay, and, try, to, make, constructive, changes, from, within, the, anglican, church, they, became, known, as, puritans, and, are, described, by, gourley, as, cousins, of, the, english, separatists, others, decided, they, must, leave, the, church, because, of, their, dissatisfaction, and, became, known, as, the, separatists, in, 1579, faustus, socinus, founded, the, unitarian, polish, brethren, in, poland, lithuania, which, was, a, tolerant, country, the, unitarians, taught, baptism, by, immersion, after, their, expulsion, from, the, commonwealth, many, of, them, fled, to, the, netherlands, in, the, netherlands, the, unitarians, introduced, immersion, baptism, to, the, dutch, mennonites, baptist, churches, have, their, origins, in, a, movement, started, by, john, smyth, and, thomas, helwys, in, amsterdam, because, they, shared, beliefs, with, the, puritans, and, congregationalists, they, went, into, exile, in, 1607, with, other, believers, who, held, the, same, biblical, positions, they, believe, that, the, bible, is, to, be, the, only, guide, and, that, the, believer, s, baptism, is, what, the, scriptures, require, in, 1609, the, year, considered, to, be, the, foundation, of, the, movement, they, baptized, believers, and, founded, the, first, baptist, church, in, 1609, while, still, there, smyth, wrote, a, tract, titled, the, character, of, the, beast, or, the, false, constitution, of, the, church, in, it, he, expressed, two, propositions, first, infants, are, not, to, be, baptized, and, second, antichristians, converted, are, to, be, admitted, into, the, true, church, by, baptism, hence, his, conviction, was, that, a, scriptural, church, should, consist, only, of, regenerate, believers, who, have, been, baptized, on, a, personal, confession, of, faith, he, rejected, the, separatist, movement, s, doctrine, of, infant, baptism, shortly, thereafter, smyth, left, the, group, ultimately, smyth, became, committed, to, believers, baptism, as, the, only, biblical, baptism, he, was, convinced, on, the, basis, of, his, interpretation, of, scripture, that, infants, would, not, be, damned, should, they, die, in, infancy, smyth, convinced, that, his, self, baptism, was, invalid, applied, with, the, mennonites, for, membership, he, died, while, waiting, for, membership, and, some, of, his, followers, became, mennonites, helwys, and, others, kept, their, baptism, and, their, baptist, commitments, the, modern, baptist, denomination, is, an, outgrowth, of, smyth, s, movement, baptists, rejected, the, name, anabaptist, when, they, were, called, that, by, opponents, in, derision, mcbeth, writes, that, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, many, baptists, referred, to, themselves, as, the, christians, commonly, though, falsely, called, anabaptists, helwys, took, over, the, leadership, leading, the, church, back, to, england, in, 1611, and, he, published, the, first, baptist, confession, of, faith, a, declaration, of, faith, of, english, people, in, 1611, he, founded, the, first, general, baptist, church, in, spitalfields, east, london, in, 1612, another, milestone, in, the, early, development, of, baptist, doctrine, was, in, 1638, with, john, spilsbury, a, calvinist, minister, who, helped, to, promote, the, strict, practice, of, believer, s, baptism, by, immersion, as, opposed, to, affusion, or, aspersion, according, to, tom, nettles, professor, of, historical, theology, at, southern, baptist, theological, seminary, spilsbury, s, cogent, arguments, for, a, gathered, disciplined, congregation, of, believers, baptized, by, immersion, as, constituting, the, new, testament, church, gave, expression, to, and, built, on, insights, that, had, emerged, within, separatism, advanced, in, the, life, of, john, smyth, and, the, suffering, congregation, of, thomas, helwys, and, matured, in, particular, baptists, a, minority, view, is, that, early, 17th, century, baptists, were, influenced, by, but, not, directly, connected, to, continental, anabaptists, according, to, this, view, the, general, baptists, shared, similarities, with, dutch, waterlander, mennonites, one, of, many, anabaptist, groups, including, believer, s, baptism, only, religious, liberty, separation, of, church, and, state, and, arminian, views, of, salvation, predestination, and, original, sin, it, is, certain, that, the, early, baptist, church, led, by, smyth, had, contacts, with, the, anabaptists, however, it, is, debated, if, these, influences, found, their, way, into, the, english, general, baptists, representatives, of, this, theory, include, a, c, underwood, and, william, r, estep, gourley, writes, that, among, some, contemporary, baptist, scholars, who, emphasize, the, faith, of, the, community, over, soul, liberty, the, anabaptist, influence, theory, is, making, a, comeback, this, view, was, also, taught, by, the, reformed, historian, philip, schaff, however, the, relations, between, baptists, and, anabaptists, were, early, strained, in, 1624, the, five, existing, baptist, churches, of, london, issued, a, condemnation, of, the, anabaptists, furthermore, the, original, group, associated, with, smyth, popularly, believed, to, be, the, first, baptists, broke, with, the, waterlander, mennonite, anabaptists, after, a, brief, period, of, association, in, the, netherlands, traditional, baptist, historians, write, from, the, perspective, that, baptists, had, existed, since, the, time, of, christ, proponents, of, the, baptist, successionist, or, perpetuity, view, consider, the, baptist, movement, to, have, existed, independently, from, roman, catholicism, and, prior, to, the, protestant, reformation, the, perpetuity, view, is, often, identified, with, the, trail, of, blood, a, booklet, of, five, lectures, by, james, milton, carroll, published, in, 1931, other, baptist, writers, who, advocate, the, successionist, theory, of, baptist, origins, are, john, t, christian, and, thomas, crosby, this, view, was, held, by, english, baptist, preacher, charles, spurgeon, as, well, as, jesse, mercer, the, namesake, of, mercer, university, in, 1898, william, whitsitt, was, pressured, to, resign, his, presidency, of, the, southern, baptist, theological, seminary, for, denying, baptist, successionism, in, 1612, helwys, established, a, baptist, congregation, in, london, consisting, of, congregants, from, smyth, s, church, a, number, of, other, baptist, churches, sprang, up, and, they, became, known, as, the, general, baptists, the, particular, baptists, were, established, when, a, group, of, calvinist, separatists, adopted, believers, baptism, the, particular, baptists, consisted, of, seven, churches, by, 1644, and, had, created, a, confession, of, faith, called, the, first, london, confession, of, faith, both, roger, williams, and, john, clarke, are, variously, credited, as, founding, the, earliest, baptist, church, in, north, america, in, 1639, williams, established, a, baptist, church, in, providence, rhode, island, and, clarke, began, a, baptist, church, in, newport, rhode, island, according, to, a, baptist, historian, who, has, researched, the, matter, extensively, there, is, much, debate, over, the, centuries, as, to, whether, the, providence, or, newport, church, deserved, the, place, of, first, baptist, congregation, in, america, exact, records, for, both, congregations, are, lacking, the, first, great, awakening, energized, the, baptist, movement, and, the, baptist, community, experienced, spectacular, growth, baptists, became, the, largest, christian, community, in, many, southern, states, including, among, the, enslaved, black, population, baptist, missionary, work, in, canada, began, in, the, british, colony, of, nova, scotia, present, day, nova, scotia, and, new, brunswick, in, the, 1760s, the, first, official, record, of, a, baptist, church, in, canada, was, horton, baptist, church, now, wolfville, in, wolfville, nova, scotia, on, 29, october, 1778, the, church, was, established, with, the, assistance, of, the, new, light, evangelist, henry, alline, many, of, alline, s, followers, after, his, death, converted, and, strengthened, the, baptist, presence, in, the, atlantic, region, two, major, groups, of, baptists, formed, the, basis, of, the, churches, in, the, maritimes, these, were, referred, to, as, regular, baptist, calvinistic, in, their, doctrine, and, free, will, baptists, arminian, in, their, doctrine, in, may, 1845, the, baptist, congregations, in, the, united, states, split, over, slavery, and, missions, the, home, mission, society, prevented, slaveholders, from, being, appointed, as, missionaries, the, split, created, the, southern, baptist, convention, while, the, northern, congregations, formed, their, own, umbrella, organization, now, called, the, american, baptist, churches, usa, abc, usa, in, 2015, baptists, in, the, u, s, number, 50, million, people, and, constitute, roughly, one, third, of, american, protestants, the, baptist, churches, in, ukraine, were, preceded, by, the, german, anabaptist, and, mennonite, communities, who, had, been, living, in, southern, ukraine, since, the, 16th, century, and, who, practiced, adult, believer, s, baptism, the, first, baptist, baptism, adult, baptism, by, full, immersion, in, ukraine, took, place, in, 1864, on, the, river, inhul, in, the, yelizavetgrad, region, now, kropyvnytskyi, region, in, a, german, settlement, in, 1867, the, first, baptist, communities, were, organized, in, that, area, from, there, the, baptist, movement, spread, across, the, south, of, ukraine, and, then, to, other, regions, as, well, one, of, the, first, baptist, communities, was, registered, in, kyiv, in, 1907, and, in, 1908, the, first, all, russian, convention, of, baptists, was, held, there, as, ukraine, was, still, controlled, by, the, russian, empire, the, all, russian, union, of, baptists, was, established, in, yekaterinoslav, now, dnipro, in, southern, ukraine, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, there, were, between, 100, 000, and, 300, 000, baptists, in, ukraine, an, independent, all, ukrainian, baptist, union, of, ukraine, was, established, during, the, brief, period, of, ukraine, s, independence, in, early, 20th, century, and, once, again, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, the, largest, of, which, is, currently, known, as, the, evangelical, baptist, union, of, ukraine, some, baptist, church, congregations, choose, to, be, independent, of, larger, church, organizations, independent, baptist, other, baptist, churches, choose, to, be, part, of, an, international, or, national, baptist, christian, denomination, or, association, while, still, adhering, to, a, congregationalist, polity, this, cooperative, relationship, allows, the, development, of, common, organizations, for, mission, and, societal, purposes, such, as, humanitarian, aid, schools, theological, institutes, and, hospitals, the, majority, of, baptist, churches, are, part, of, national, denominations, or, associations, or, cooperative, groups, as, well, as, the, baptist, world, alliance, bwa, formed, in, 1905, by, 24, baptist, denominations, from, various, countries, the, bwa, s, goals, include, caring, for, the, needy, leading, in, world,

founded, in, 1792, at, kettering, england, in, united, states, international, ministries, was, founded, in, 1814, and, the, international, mission, board, was, founded, in, 1845, membership, policies, vary, due, to, the, autonomy, of, churches, but, generally, an, individual, becomes, a, member, of, a, church, through, believer, s, baptism, which, is, a, public, profession, of, faith, in, jesus, followed, by, immersion, baptism, most, baptists, do, not, believe, that, baptism, is, a, requirement, for, salvation, but, rather, a, public, expression, of, inner, repentance, and, faith, in, general, baptist, churches, do, not, have, a, stated, age, restriction, on, membership, but, believer, s, baptism, requires, that, an, individual, be, able, to, freely, and, earnestly, profess, their, faith, in, 2010, an, estimated, 100, million, christians, identified, as, baptist, or, belonging, to, a, baptist, type, church, in, 2020, according, to, the, researcher, s, bastien, fath, of, the,

countries, with, 176, 000, churches, and, 51, million, baptized, members, these, statistics, may, not, be, fully, representative, however, since, some, churches, in, the, united, states, have, dual, or, triple, national, baptist, affiliation, causing, a, church, and, its, members, to, be, counted, possibly, by, more, than, one, baptist, association, if, these, associations, are, members, of, the, bwa, among, the, censuses, carried, out, by, individual, baptist, associations, in, 2023, those, which, claimed, the, most, members, on, each, continent, were, since, the, early, days, of, the, baptist, movement, various, associations, have, adopted, common, confessions, of, faith, as, the, basis, for, cooperative, work, among, churches, each, church, has, a, particular, confession, of, faith, and, a, common, confession, of, faith, if, it, is, a, member, of, an, association, of, churches, some, historically, significant, baptist, doctrinal, documents, include, the, 1689, london, baptist, confession, of, faith, 1742, philadelphia, baptist, confession, the, 1833, new, hampshire, baptist, confession, of, faith, and, written, church, covenants, which, some, individual, baptist, churches, adopt, as, a, statement, of, their, faith, and, beliefs, baptist, theology, shares, many, doctrines, with, evangelical, theology, it, is, based, on, believers, church, doctrine, baptists, like, other, christians, are, defined, by, school, of, thought, some, of, it, common, to, all, orthodox, and, evangelical, groups, and, a, portion, of, it, distinctive, to, baptists, through, the, years, different, baptist, groups, have, issued, confessions, of, faith, without, considering, them, to, be, creeds, to, express, their, particular, doctrinal, distinctions, in, comparison, to, other, christians, as, well, as, in, comparison, to, other, baptists, baptist, denominations, are, traditionally, seen, as, belonging, to, two, parties, general, baptists, who, uphold, arminian, theology, and, particular, baptists, who, uphold, reformed, theology, calvinism, during, the, holiness, movement, some, general, baptists, accepted, the, teaching, of, a, second, work, of, grace, and, formed, denominations, that, emphasized, this, belief, such, as, the, ohio, valley, association, of, the, christian, baptist, churches, of, god, and, the, holiness, baptist, association, most, baptists, are, evangelical, in, doctrine, but, their, beliefs, may, vary, due, to, the, congregational, governance, system, that, gives, autonomy, to, individual, local, baptist, churches, historically, baptists, have, played, a, key, role, in, encouraging, religious, freedom, and, the, doctrine, of, separation, of, church, and, state, shared, doctrines, would, include, beliefs, about, one, god, the, virgin, birth, of, jesus, miracles, substitutionary, atonement, for, sins, through, the, death, burial, and, bodily, resurrection, of, jesus, the, trinity, the, need, for, salvation, through, belief, in, jesus, christ, as, the, son, of, god, his, death, and, resurrection, grace, the, kingdom, of, god, last, things, eschatology, jesus, christ, will, return, personally, and, visibly, in, glory, to, earth, the, dead, will, be, raised, and, christ, will, judge, everyone, in, righteousness, and, evangelism, and, missions, most, baptists, hold, that, no, church, or, ecclesiastical, organization, has, inherent, authority, over, a, baptist, church, churches, can, properly, relate, to, each, other, under, this, polity, only, through, voluntary, cooperation, never, by, any, sort, of, coercion, furthermore, this, baptist, polity, calls, for, freedom, from, governmental, control, exceptions, to, this, local, form, of, local, governance, include, a, few, churches, that, submit, to, the, leadership, of, a, body, of, elders, as, well, as, the, episcopal, baptists, who, have, an, episcopal, system, baptists, generally, believe, in, the, literal, second, coming, of, christ, beliefs, among, baptists, regarding, the, end, times, include, amillennialism, both, dispensational, and, historic, premillennialism, with, views, such, as, postmillennialism, and, preterism, receiving, some, support, some, additional, distinctive, baptist, principles, held, by, many, baptists, 2, since, there, is, no, hierarchical, authority, and, each, baptist, church, is, autonomous, there, is, no, official, set, of, baptist, theological, beliefs, these, differences, exist, among, associations, and, even, among, churches, within, the, associations, some, doctrinal, issues, on, which, there, is, widespread, difference, among, baptists, are, excommunication, may, be, used, as, a, last, resort, by, some, denominations, and, churches, for, members, who, do, not, want, to, repent, of, beliefs, or, behavior, at, odds, with, the, confession, of, faith, of, the, community, when, an, entire, congregation, is, excluded, it, is, often, called, disfellowship, in, baptist, churches, worship, service, is, part, of, the, life, of, the, church, and, includes, praise, worship, of, prayers, to, god, a, sermon, based, on, the, bible, offering, and, periodically, the, lord, s, supper, some, churches, have, services, with, traditional, christian, music, others, with, contemporary, christian, music, and, some, offer, both, in, separate, services, in, many, churches, there, are, services, adapted, for, children, even, teenagers, prayer, meetings, are, also, held, during, the, week, the, architecture, is, generally, sober, and, the, latin, cross, is, one, of, the, only, spiritual, symbols, that, can, usually, be, seen, on, the, building, of, a, baptist, church, and, that, identifies, the, place, where, it, belongs, baptist, churches, established, elementary, and, secondary, schools, bible, colleges, colleges, and, universities, as, early, as, the, 1680s, in, england, before, continuing, in, various, countries, in, 2006, the, international, association, of, baptist, colleges, and, universities, was, founded, in, the, united, states, in, 2023, it, had, 42, member, universities, many, churches, promote, virginity, pledges, to, young, baptist, christians, who, are, invited, to, engage, in, a, public, ceremony, of, sexual, abstinence, until, christian, marriage, this, pact, is, often, symbolized, by, a, purity, ring, programs, like, true, love, waits, founded, in, 1993, by, the, southern, baptist, convention, have, been, developed, to, support, the, commitments, most, baptist, associations, around, the, world, believe, only, in, marriage, between, a, man, and, a, woman, some, baptist, associations, in, the, united, states, do, not, have, official, beliefs, about, marriage, in, a, confession, of, faith, and, invoke, congregationalism, to, leave, the, choice, to, each, church, to, decide, this, is, the, case, of, american, baptist, churches, usa, progressive, national, baptist, convention, cooperative, baptist, fellowship, and, national, baptist, convention, usa, some, baptist, associations, support, same, sex, marriage, this, is, the, case, of, the, alliance, of, baptists, usa, the, canadian, association, for, baptist, freedoms, the, alian, a, de, batistas, do, brasil, the, fraternidad, de, iglesias, bautistas, de, cuba, and, the, association, of, welcoming, and, affirming, baptists, international, baptists, have, faced, many, controversies, in, their, 400, year, history, controversies, of, the, level, of, crises, baptist, historian, walter, shurden, says, the, word, crisis, comes, from, the, greek, word, meaning, to, decide, shurden, writes, that, contrary, to, the, presumed, negative, view, of, crises, some, controversies, that, reach, a, crisis, level, may, actually, be, positive, and, highly, productive, he, claims, that, even, schism, though, never, ideal, has, often, produced, positive, results, in, his, opinion, crises, among, baptists, each, have, become, decision, moments, that, shaped, their, future, early, in, the, 19th, century, the, rise, of, the, modern, missions, movement, and, the, backlash, against, it, led, to, widespread, and, bitter, controversy, among, the, american, baptists, during, this, era, the, american, baptists, were, split, between, missionary, and, anti, missionary, a, substantial, secession, of, baptists, went, into, the, movement, led, by, alexander, campbell, to, return, to, a, more, fundamental, church, leading, up, to, the, american, civil, war, baptists, became, embroiled, in, the, controversy, over, slavery, in, the, united, states, whereas, in, the, first, great, awakening, methodist, and, baptist, preachers, had, opposed, slavery, and, urged, manumission, over, the, decades, they, made, more, of, an, accommodation, with, the, institution, they, worked, with, slaveholders, in, the, south, to, urge, a, paternalistic, institution, both, denominations, made, direct, appeals, to, slaves, and, free, blacks, for, conversion, the, baptists, particularly, allowed, them, active, roles, in, congregations, by, the, mid, 19th, century, northern, baptists, tended, to, oppose, slavery, as, tensions, increased, in, 1844, the, home, mission, society, refused, to, appoint, a, slaveholder, as, a, missionary, who, had, been, proposed, by, georgia, it, noted, that, missionaries, could, not, take, servants, with, them, and, also, that, the, board, did, not, want, to, appear, to, condone, slavery, in, 1845, a, group, of, churches, in, favor, of, slavery, and, in, disagreement, with, the, abolitionism, of, the, triennial, convention, now, american, baptist, churches, usa, left, to, form, the, southern, baptist, convention, they, believed, that, the, bible, sanctions, slavery, and, that, it, was, acceptable, for, christians, to, own, slaves, they, believed, slavery, was, a, human, institution, which, baptist, teaching, could, make, less, harsh, by, this, time, many, planters, were, part, of, baptist, congregations, and, some, of, the, denomination, s, prominent, preachers, such, as, basil, manly, sr, president, of, the, university, of, alabama, were, also, planters, who, owned, slaves, as, early, as, the, late, 18th, century, black, baptists, began, to, organize, separate, churches, associations, and, mission, agencies, blacks, set, up, some, independent, baptist, congregations, in, the, south, before, the, civil, war,

churches, in, 1866, the, consolidated, american, baptist, convention, formed, from, black, baptists, of, the, south, and, west, helped, southern, associations, set, up, black, state, conventions, which, they, did, in, alabama, arkansas, virginia, north, carolina, and, kentucky, in, 1880, black, state, conventions, united, in, the, national, foreign, mission, convention, to, support, black, baptist, missionary, work, two, other, national, black, conventions, were, formed, and, in, 1895, they, united, as, the, national, baptist, convention, this, organization, later, went, through, its, own, changes, spinning, off, other, conventions, it, is, the, largest, black, religious, organization, and, the, second, largest, baptist, organization, in, the, world, baptists, are, numerically, most, dominant, in, the, southeast, in, 2007, the, pew, research, center, s, religious, landscape, survey, found, that, 45, of, all, african, americans, identify, with, baptist, denominations, with, the, vast, majority, of, those, being, within, the, historically, black, tradition, in, the, american, south, the, interpretation, of, the, civil, war, abolition, of, slavery, and, postwar, period, has, differed, sharply, by, race, since, those, years, americans, have, often, interpreted, great, events, in, religious, terms, historian, wilson, fallin, contrasts, the, interpretation, of, civil, war, and, reconstruction, in, white, versus, black, memory, by, analyzing, baptist, sermons, documented, in, alabama, soon, after, the, civil, war, most, black, baptists, in, the, south, left, the, southern, baptist, convention, reducing, its, numbers, by, hundreds, of, thousands, or, more, they, quickly, organized, their, own, congregations, and, developed, their, own, regional, and, state, associations, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, national, convention, white, preachers, in, alabama, after, reconstruction, expressed, the, view, that, god, had, chastised, them, and, given, them, a, special, mission, to, maintain, orthodoxy, strict, biblicism, personal, piety, and, traditional, race, relations, slavery, they, insisted, had, not, been, sinful, rather, emancipation, was, a, historical, tragedy, and, the, end, of, reconstruction, was, a, clear, sign, of, god, s, favor, black, preachers, interpreted, the, civil, war, emancipation, and, reconstruction, as, god, s, gift, of, freedom, they, had, a, gospel, of, liberation, having, long, identified, with, the, book, of, exodus, from, slavery, in, the, old, testament, they, took, opportunities, to, exercise, their, independence, to, worship, in, their, own, way, to, affirm, their, worth, and, dignity, and, to, proclaim, the, fatherhood, of, god, and, the, brotherhood, of, man, most, of, all, they, quickly, formed, their, own, churches, associations, and, conventions, to, operate, freely, without, white, supervision, these, institutions, offered, self, help, and, racial, uplift, a, place, to, develop, and, use, leadership, and, places, for, proclamation, of, the, gospel, of, liberation, as, a, result, black, preachers, said, that, god, would, protect, and, help, him, and, god, s, people, god, would, be, their, rock, in, a, stormy, land, the, southern, baptist, convention, supported, white, supremacy, and, its, results, disenfranchising, most, blacks, and, many, poor, whites, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, by, raising, barriers, to, voter, registration, and, passage, of, racial, segregation, laws, that, enforced, the, system, of, jim, crow, its, members, largely, resisted, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, south, which, sought, to, enforce, their, constitutional, rights, for, public, access, and, voting, and, enforcement, of, midcentury, federal, civil, rights, laws, in, 1995, the, southern, baptist, convention, passed, a, resolution, that, recognized, the, failure, of, their, ancestors, to, protect, the, civil, rights, of, african, americans, more, than, 20, 000, southern, baptists, registered, for, the, meeting, in, atlanta, the, resolution, declared, that, messengers, as, sbc, delegates, are, called, unwaveringly, denounce, racism, in, all, its, forms, as, deplorable, sin, and, lament, and, repudiate, historic, acts, of, evil, such, as, slavery, from, which, we, continue, to, reap, a, bitter, harvest, it, offered, an, apology, to, all, african, americans, for, condoning, and, or, perpetuating, individual, and, systemic, racism, in, our, lifetime, and, repentance, for, racism, of, which, we, have, been, guilty, whether, consciously, or, unconsciously, although, southern, baptists, have, condemned, racism, in, the, past, this, was, the, first, time, the, convention, predominantly, white, since, the, reconstruction, era, had, specifically, addressed, the, issue, of, slavery, the, statement, sought, forgiveness, from, our, african, american, brothers, and, sisters, and, pledged, to, eradicate, racism, in, all, its, forms, from, southern, baptist, life, and, ministry, in, 1995, about, 500, 000, members, of, the, 15, 6, million, member, denomination, were, african, americans, and, another, 300, 000, were, ethnic, minorities, the, resolution, marked, the, denomination, s, first, formal, acknowledgment, that, racism, played, a, role, in, its, founding, a, healthy, church, kills, error, and, tears, evil, in, pieces, not, so, very, long, ago, our, nation, tolerated, slavery, in, our, colonies, philanthropists, endeavored, to, destroy, slavery, but, when, was, it, utterly, abolished, it, was, when, wilberforce, roused, the, church, of, god, and, when, the, church, of, god, addressed, herself, to, the, conflict, then, she, tore, the, evil, thing, to, pieces, c, h, spurgeon, an, outspoken, british, baptist, opponent, of, slavery, in, the, best, war, cry, 1883, elsewhere, in, the, americas, in, the, caribbean, in, particular, baptist, missionaries, and, members, took, an, active, role, in, the, anti, slavery, movement, in, jamaica, for, example, william, knibb, a, prominent, british, baptist, missionary, worked, toward, the, emancipation, of, slaves, in, the, british, west, indies, which, took, place, in, full, in, 1838, knibb, supported, the, creation, of, free, villages, and, sought, funding, from, english, baptists, to, buy, land, for, freedmen, to, cultivate, the, free, villages, were, envisioned, as, rural, communities, to, be, centered, around, a, baptist, church, where, emancipated, slaves, could, farm, their, own, land, thomas, burchell, missionary, minister, in, montego, bay, was, active, in, this, movement, gaining, funds, from, baptists, in, england, to, buy, land, for, what, became, known, as, burchell, free, village, prior, to, emancipation, baptist, deacon, samuel, sharpe, who, served, with, burchell, organized, a, general, strike, of, slaves, seeking, better, conditions, it, developed, into, a, major, rebellion, of, as, many, as, 60, 000, slaves, which, became, known, as, the, christmas, rebellion, or, the, baptist, war, it, was, put, down, by, government, troops, within, two, weeks, during, and, after, the, rebellion, an, estimated, 200, slaves, were, killed, outright, with, more, than, 300, judicially, executed, later, by, prosecution, in, the, courts, sometimes, for, minor, offenses, baptists, were, active, after, emancipation, in, promoting, the, education, of, former, slaves, for, example, jamaica, s, calabar, high, school, named, after, the, port, of, calabar, in, nigeria, was, founded, by, baptist, missionaries, at, the, same, time, during, and, after, slavery, slaves, and, free, blacks, formed, their, own, spiritual, baptist, movements, breakaway, spiritual, movements, which, theology, often, expressed, resistance, to, oppression, southern, baptist, landmarkism, sought, to, reset, the, ecclesiastical, separation, which, had, characterized, the, old, baptist, churches, in, an, era, when, inter, denominational, union, meetings, were, the, order, of, the, day, james, robinson, graves, was, an, influential, baptist, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, primary, leader, of, this, movement, while, some, landmarkers, eventually, separated, from, the, southern, baptist, convention, the, movement, continued, to, influence, the, convention, into, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, rise, of, theological, modernism, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, also, greatly, affected, baptists, the, landmark, movement, has, been, described, as, a, reaction, among, southern, baptists, in, the, united, states, against, incipient, modernism, in, england, charles, spurgeon, fought, against, modernistic, views, of, the, scripture, in, the, downgrade, controversy, and, severed, his, church, from, the, baptist, union, as, a, result, the, northern, baptist, convention, in, the, united, states, had, internal, conflict, over, modernism, in, the, early, 20th, century, ultimately, embracing, it, two, new, conservative, associations, of, congregations, that, separated, from, the, convention, were, founded, as, a, result, the, general, association, of, regular, baptist, churches, in, 1933, and, the, conservative, baptist, association, of, america, in, 1947, following, similar, conflicts, over, modernism, the, southern, baptist, convention, adhered, to, conservative, theology, as, its, official, position, in, the, late, 20th, century, southern, baptists, who, disagreed, with, this, direction, founded, two, new, groups, the, liberal, alliance, of, baptists, in, 1987, and, the, more, moderate, cooperative, baptist, fellowship, in, 1991, originally, both, schisms, continued, to, identify, as, southern, baptist, but, over, time, they, became, permanent, new, families, of, baptists, in, his, 1963, book, strength, to, love, baptist, pastor, martin, luther, king, jr, criticized, some, baptist, churches, for, their, anti, intellectualism, especially, because, of, the, lack, of, theological, training, among, pastors, in, 2018, baptist, theologian, russell, d, moore, criticized, some, baptists, in, the, united, states, for, their, moralism, emphasizing, strongly, the, condemnation, of, certain, personal, sins, but, silent, on, the, social, injustices, that, afflict, entire, populations, such, as, racism, in, 2020, the, north, american, baptist, fellowship, a, region, of, the, baptist, world, alliance, officially, made, a, commitment, to, social, justice, and, spoke, out, against, institutionalized, discrimination, in, the, american, justice, system, in, 2022, the, baptist, world, alliance, adopted, a, resolution, encouraging, baptist, churches, and, associations, that, have, historically, contributed, to, the, sin, of, slavery, to, engage, in,
