critical, thinking, is, the, analysis, of, available, facts, evidence, observations, and, arguments, in, order, to, form, a, judgement, by, the, application, of, rational, skeptical, and, unbiased, analyses, and, evaluation, in, modern, times, the, use, of, the, phrase, critical, thinking, can, be, traced, to, john, dewey, who, used, the, phrase, reflective, thinking, the, application, of, critical, thinking, includes, self, directed, self, disciplined, self, monitored, and, self, corrective, habits, of, the, mind, thus, a, critical, thinker, is, a, person, who, practices, the, skills, of, critical, thinking, or, has, been, trained, and, educated, in, its, disciplines, philosopher, richard, w, paul, said, that, the, mind, of, a, critical, thinker, engages, the, person, s, intellectual, abilities, and, personality, traits, critical, thinking, presupposes, assent, to, rigorous, standards, of, excellence, and, mindful, command, of, their, use, in, effective, communication, and, problem, solving, and, a, commitment, to, overcome, egocentrism, and, sociocentrism, in, the, classical, period, 5th, c, 4th, c, bc, of, ancient, greece, the, philosopher, plato, 428, 347, bc, indicated, that, the, teachings, of, socrates, 470, 399, bc, are, the, earliest, records, of, what, today, is, called, critical, thinking, in, an, early, dialogue, by, plato, the, philosopher, socrates, debates, several, speakers, about, the, ethical, matter, of, the, rightness, or, wrongness, of, socrates, escaping, from, prison, upon, consideration, plato, concluded, that, to, escape, prison, would, violate, everything, he, believes, to, be, greater, than, himself, the, laws, of, athens, and, the, guiding, voice, that, socrates, claims, to, hear, socrates, established, the, unreliability, of, authority, and, of, authority, figures, to, possess, knowledge, and, consequent, insight, that, for, an, individual, man, or, woman, to, lead, a, good, life, that, is, worth, living, that, person, must, ask, critical, questions, and, possess, an, interrogative, soul, which, seeks, evidence, and, then, closely, examines, the, available, facts, and, then, follows, the, implications, of, the, statement, under, analysis, thereby, tracing, the, implications, of, thought, and, action, as, a, form, of, co, operative, argumentation, socratic, questioning, requires, the, comparative, judgment, of, facts, which, answers, then, would, reveal, the, person, s, irrational, thinking, and, lack, of, verifiable, knowledge, socrates, also, demonstrated, that, authority, does, not, ensure, accurate, verifiable, knowledge, thus, socratic, questioning, analyses, beliefs, assumptions, and, presumptions, by, relying, upon, evidence, and, a, sound, rationale, in, modern, times, the, phrase, critical, thinking, was, coined, by, pragmatist, philosopher, john, dewey, in, his, book, how, we, think, as, a, type, of, intellectualism, the, development, of, critical, thinking, is, a, means, of, critical, analysis, that, applies, rationality, to, develop, a, critique, of, the, subject, matter, according, to, the, foundation, for, critical, thinking, in, 1987, the, u, s, national, council, for, excellence, in, critical, thinking, defined, critical, thinking, as, the, intellectually, disciplined, process, of, actively, and, skillfully, conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or, evaluating, information, gathered, from, or, generated, by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or, communication, as, a, guide, to, belief, and, action, in, the, term, critical, thinking, the, word, critical, grk, kritikos, critic, derives, from, the, word, critic, and, implies, a, critique, it, identifies, the, intellectual, capacity, and, the, means, of, judging, of, judgement, for, judging, and, of, being, able, to, discern, the, intellectual, roots, of, critical, thinking, are, as, ancient, as, its, etymology, traceable, ultimately, to, the, critical, reasoning, of, the, presocractic, philosophers, as, well, as, the, teaching, practice, and, vision, of, socrates, 2, 500, years, ago, who, discovered, by, a, method, of, probing, questioning, that, people, could, not, rationally, justify, their, confident, claims, to, knowledge, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, exact, term, critical, thinking, first, appeared, in, 1815, in, the, british, literary, journal, the, critical, review, referring, to, critical, analysis, in, the, literary, context, the, meaning, of, critical, thinking, gradually, evolved, and, expanded, to, mean, a, desirable, general, thinking, skill, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, traditionally, critical, thinking, has, been, variously, defined, as, follows, contemporary, critical, thinking, scholars, have, expanded, these, traditional, definitions, to, include, qualities, concepts, and, processes, such, as, creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting, knowing, feminist, theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and, inconclusiveness, some, definitions, of, critical, thinking, exclude, these, subjective, practices, the, study, of, logical, argumentation, is, relevant, to, the, study, of, critical, thinking, logic, is, concerned, with, the, analysis, of, arguments, including, the, appraisal, of, their, correctness, or, incorrectness, in, the, field, of, epistemology, critical, thinking, is, considered, to, be, logically, correct, thinking, which, allows, for, differentiation, between, logically, true, and, logically, false, statements, in, first, wave, logical, thinking, the, thinker, is, removed, from, the, train, of, thought, and, the, analysis, of, connections, between, concepts, or, points, in, thought, is, ostensibly, free, of, any, bias, in, his, essay, beyond, logicism, in, critical, thinking, kerry, s, walters, describes, this, ideology, thus, a, logistic, approach, to, critical, thinking, conveys, the, message, to, students, that, thinking, is, legitimate, only, when, it, conforms, to, the, procedures, of, informal, and, to, a, lesser, extent, formal, logic, and, that, the, good, thinker, necessarily, aims, for, styles, of, examination, and, appraisal, that, are, analytical, abstract, universal, and, objective, this, model, of, thinking, has, become, so, entrenched, in, conventional, academic, wisdom, that, many, educators, accept, it, as, canon, such, principles, are, concomitant, with, the, increasing, dependence, on, a, quantitative, understanding, of, the, world, in, the, second, wave, of, critical, thinking, authors, consciously, moved, away, from, the, logocentric, mode, of, critical, thinking, characteristic, of, the, first, wave, although, many, scholars, began, to, take, a, less, exclusive, view, of, what, constitutes, critical, thinking, rationality, and, logic, remain, widely, accepted, as, essential, bases, for, critical, thinking, walters, argues, that, exclusive, logicism, in, the, first, wave, sense, is, based, on, the, unwarranted, assumption, that, good, thinking, is, reducible, to, logical, thinking, there, are, three, types, of, logical, reasoning, informally, two, kinds, of, logical, reasoning, can, be, distinguished, in, addition, to, formal, deduction, which, are, induction, and, abduction, kerry, s, walters, an, emeritus, philosophy, professor, from, gettysburg, college, argues, that, rationality, demands, more, than, just, logical, or, traditional, methods, of, problem, solving, and, analysis, or, what, he, calls, the, calculus, of, justification, but, also, considers, cognitive, acts, such, as, imagination, conceptual, creativity, intuition, and, insight, 63, these, functions, are, focused, on, discovery, on, more, abstract, processes, instead, of, linear, rules, based, approaches, to, problem, solving, the, linear, and, non, sequential, mind, must, both, be, engaged, in, the, rational, mind, the, ability, to, critically, analyze, an, argument, to, dissect, structure, and, components, thesis, and, reasons, is, essential, but, so, is, the, ability, to, be, flexible, and, consider, non, traditional, alternatives, and, perspectives, these, complementary, functions, are, what, allow, for, critical, thinking, to, be, a, practice, encompassing, imagination, and, intuition, in, cooperation, with, traditional, modes, of, deductive, inquiry, the, list, of, core, critical, thinking, skills, includes, observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and, metacognition, according, to, reynolds, 2011, an, individual, or, group, engaged, in, a, strong, way, of, critical, thinking, gives, due, consideration, to, establish, for, instance, in, addition, to, possessing, strong, critical, thinking, skills, one, must, be, disposed, to, engage, problems, and, decisions, using, those, skills, critical, thinking, employs, not, only, logic, but, broad, intellectual, criteria, such, as, clarity, credibility, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, significance, and, fairness, critical, thinking, calls, for, the, ability, to, in, sum, a, persistent, effort, to, examine, any, belief, or, supposed, form, of, knowledge, in, the, light, of, the, evidence, that, supports, or, refutes, it, and, the, further, conclusions, to, which, it, tends, the, habits, of, mind, that, characterize, a, person, strongly, disposed, toward, critical, thinking, include, a, desire, to, follow, reason, and, evidence, wherever, they, may, lead, a, systematic, approach, to, problem, solving, inquisitiveness, even, handedness, and, confidence, in, reasoning, according, to, a, definition, analysis, by, kompf, bond, 2001, critical, thinking, involves, problem, solving, decision, making, metacognition, rationality, rational, thinking, reasoning, knowledge, intelligence, and, also, a, moral, component, such, as, reflective, thinking, critical, thinkers, therefore, need, to, have, reached, a, level, of, maturity, in, their, development, possess, a, certain, attitude, as, well, as, a, set, of, taught, skills, there, is, a, postulation, by, some, writers, that, the, tendencies, from, habits, of, mind, should, be, thought, as, virtues, to, demonstrate, the, characteristics, of, a, critical, thinker, these, intellectual, virtues, are, ethical, qualities, that, encourage, motivation, to, think, in, particular, ways, towards, specific, circumstances, however, these, virtues, have, also, been, criticized, by, skeptics, who, argue, that, the, evidence, is, lacking, for, a, specific, mental, basis, underpinning, critical, thinking, after, undertaking, research, in, schools, edward, m, glaser, proposed, in, 1941, that, the, ability, to, think, critically, involves, three, elements, educational, programs, aimed, at, developing, critical, thinking, in, children, and, adult, learners, individually, or, in, group, problem, solving, and, decision, making, contexts, continue, to, address, these, same, three, central, elements, the, critical, thinking, project, at, human, science, lab, london, is, involved, in, the, scientific, study, of, all, major, educational, systems, in, prevalence, today, to, assess, how, the, systems, are, working, to, promote, or, impede, critical, thinking, contemporary, cognitive, psychology, regards, human, reasoning, as, a, complex, process, that, is, both, reactive, and, reflective, this, presents, a, problem, that, is, detailed, as, a, division, of, a, critical, mind, in, juxtaposition, to, sensory, data, and, memory, the, psychological, theory, disposes, of, the, absolute, nature, of, the, rational, mind, in, reference, to, conditions, abstract, problems, and, discursive, limitations, where, the, relationship, between, critical, thinking, skills, and, critical, thinking, dispositions, is, an, empirical, question, the, ability, to, attain, causal, domination, exists, for, which, socrates, was, known, to, be, largely, disposed, against, as, the, practice, of, sophistry, accounting, for, a, measure, of, critical, thinking, dispositions, is, the, california, measure, of, mental, motivation, and, the, california, critical, thinking, dispositions, inventory, the, critical, thinking, toolkit, is, an, alternative, measure, that, examines, student, beliefs, and, attitudes, about, critical, thinking, john, dewey, is, one, of, many, educational, leaders, who, recognized, that, a, curriculum, aimed, at, building, thinking, skills, would, benefit, the, individual, learner, the, community, and, the, entire, democracy, critical, thinking, is, significant, in, the, learning, process, of, internalization, in, the, construction, of, basic, ideas, principles, and, theories, inherent, in, content, and, critical, thinking, is, significant, in, the, learning, process, of, application, whereby, those, ideas, principles, and, theories, are, implemented, effectively, as, they, become, relevant, in, learners, lives, each, discipline, adapts, its, use, of, critical, thinking, concepts, and, principles, the, core, concepts, are, always, there, but, they, are, embedded, in, subject, specific, content, for, students, to, learn, content, intellectual, engagement, is, crucial, all, students, must, do, their, own, thinking, their, own, construction, of, knowledge, good, teachers, recognize, this, and, therefore, focus, on, the, questions, readings, activities, that, stimulate, the, mind, to, take, ownership, of, key, concepts, and, principles, underlying, the, subject, historically, the, teaching, of, critical, thinking, focused, only, on, logical, procedures, such, as, formal, and, informal, logic, this, emphasized, to, students, that, good, thinking, is, equivalent, to, logical, thinking, however, a, second, wave, of, critical, thinking, urges, educators, to, value, conventional, techniques, meanwhile, expanding, what, it, means, to, be, a, critical, thinker, in, 1994, kerry, walters, compiled, a, conglomeration, of, sources, surpassing, this, logical, restriction, to, include, many, different, authors, research, regarding, connected, knowing, empathy, gender, sensitive, ideals, collaboration, world, views, intellectual, autonomy, morality, and, enlightenment, these, concepts, invite, students, to, incorporate, their, own, perspectives, and, experiences, into, their, thinking, in, the, english, and, welsh, school, systems, critical, thinking, is, offered, as, a, subject, that, 16, to, 18, year, olds, can, take, as, an, a, level, under, the, ocr, exam, board, students, can, sit, two, exam, papers, for, the, as, credibility, of, evidence, and, assessing, and, developing, argument, the, full, advanced, gce, is, now, available, in, addition, to, the, two, as, units, candidates, sit, the, two, papers, resolution, of, dilemmas, and, critical, reasoning, the, a, level, tests, candidates, on, their, ability, to, think, critically, about, and, analyze, arguments, on, their, deductive, or, inductive, validity, as, well, as, producing, their, own, arguments, it, also, tests, their, ability, to, analyze, certain, related, topics, such, as, credibility, and, ethical, decision, making, however, due, to, its, comparative, lack, of, subject, content, many, universities, do, not, accept, it, as, a, main, a, level, for, admissions, nevertheless, the, as, is, often, useful, in, developing, reasoning, skills, and, the, full, advanced, gce, is, useful, for, degree, courses, in, politics, philosophy, history, or, theology, providing, the, skills, required, for, critical, analysis, that, are, useful, for, example, in, biblical, study, there, used, to, also, be, an, advanced, extension, award, offered, in, critical, thinking, in, the, uk, open, to, any, a, level, student, regardless, of, whether, they, have, the, critical, thinking, a, level, cambridge, international, examinations, have, an, a, level, in, thinking, skills, from, 2008, assessment, and, qualifications, alliance, has, also, been, offering, an, a, level, critical, thinking, specification, ocr, exam, board, have, also, modified, theirs, for, 2008, many, examinations, for, university, entrance, set, by, universities, on, top, of, a, level, examinations, also, include, a, critical, thinking, component, such, as, the, lnat, the, ukcat, the, biomedical, admissions, test, and, the, thinking, skills, assessment, in, qatar, critical, thinking, was, offered, by, al, bairaq, an, outreach, non, traditional, educational, program, that, targeted, high, school, students, and, focussed, on, a, curriculum, based, on, stem, fields, the, idea, behind, this, was, to, offer, high, school, students, the, opportunity, to, connect, with, the, research, environment, in, the, center, for, advanced, materials, cam, at, qatar, university, faculty, members, train, and, mentor, the, students, and, help, develop, and, enhance, their, critical, thinking, problem, solving, and, teamwork, skills, in, 1995, a, meta, analysis, of, the, literature, on, teaching, effectiveness, in, higher, education, was, undertaken, the, study, noted, concerns, from, higher, education, politicians, and, business, that, higher, education, was, failing, to, meet, society, s, requirements, for, well, educated, citizens, it, concluded, that, although, faculty, may, aspire, to, develop, students, thinking, skills, in, practice, they, have, tended, to, aim, at, facts, and, concepts, utilizing, lowest, levels, of, cognition, rather, than, developing, intellect, or, values, in, a, more, recent, meta, analysis, researchers, reviewed, 341, quasi, or, true, experimental, studies, all, of, which, used, some, form, of, standardized, critical, thinking, measure, to, assess, the, outcome, variable, the, authors, describe, the, various, methodological, approaches, and, attempt, to, categorize, differing, assessment, tools, which, include, standardized, tests, and, second, source, measures, tests, developed, by, teachers, tests, developed, by, researchers, and, tests, developed, by, teachers, who, also, serve, the, role, as, the, researcher, the, results, emphasized, the, need, for, exposing, students, to, real, world, problems, and, the, importance, of, encouraging, open, dialogue, within, a, supportive, environment, effective, strategies, for, teaching, critical, thinking, are, thought, to, be, possible, in, a, wide, variety, of, educational, settings, one, attempt, to, assess, the, humanities, role, in, teaching, critical, thinking, and, reducing, belief, in, pseudoscientific, claims, was, made, at, north, carolina, state, university, some, success, was, noted, and, the, researchers, emphasized, the, value, of, the, humanities, in, providing, the, skills, to, evaluate, current, events, and, qualitative, data, in, context, scott, lilienfeld, notes, that, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, that, basic, critical, thinking, skills, might, be, successfully, taught, to, children, at, a, younger, age, than, previously, thought, critical, thinking, is, an, important, element, of, all, professional, fields, and, academic, disciplines, by, referencing, their, respective, sets, of, permissible, questions, evidence, sources, criteria, etc, within, the, framework, of, scientific, skepticism, the, process, of, critical, thinking, involves, the, careful, acquisition, and, interpretation, of, information, and, use, of, it, to, reach, a, well, justified, conclusion, the, concepts, and, principles, of, critical, thinking, can, be, applied, to, any, context, or, case, but, only, by, reflecting, upon, the, nature, of, that, application, critical, thinking, forms, therefore, a, system, of, related, and, overlapping, modes, of, thought, such, as, anthropological, thinking, sociological, thinking, historical, thinking, political, thinking, psychological, thinking, philosophical, thinking, mathematical, thinking, chemical, thinking, biological, thinking, ecological, thinking, legal, thinking, ethical, thinking, musical, thinking, thinking, like, a, painter, sculptor, engineer, business, person, etc, in, other, words, though, critical, thinking, principles, are, universal, their, application, to, disciplines, requires, a, process, of, reflective, contextualization, psychology, offerings, for, example, have, included, courses, such, as, critical, thinking, about, the, paranormal, in, which, students, are, subjected, to, a, series, of, cold, readings, and, tested, on, their, belief, of, the, psychic, who, is, eventually, announced, to, be, a, fake, critical, thinking, is, considered, important, in, the, academic, fields, for, enabling, one, to, analyze, evaluate, explain, and, restructure, thinking, thereby, ensuring, the, act, of, thinking, without, false, belief, however, even, with, knowledge, of, the, methods, of, logical, inquiry, and, reasoning, mistakes, occur, and, due, to, a, thinker, s, inability, to, apply, the, methodology, consistently, and, because, of, overruling, character, traits, such, as, egocentrism, critical, thinking, includes, identification, of, prejudice, bias, propaganda, self, deception, distortion, misinformation, etc, given, research, in, cognitive, psychology, some, educators, believe, that, schools, should, focus, on, teaching, their, students, critical, thinking, skills, and, cultivation, of, intellectual, traits, critical, thinking, skills, can, be, used, to, help, nurses, during, the, assessment, process, through, the, use, of, critical, thinking, nurses, can, question, evaluate, and, reconstruct, the, nursing, care, process, by, challenging, the, established, theory, and, practice, critical, thinking, skills, can, help, nurses, problem, solve, reflect, and, make, a, conclusive, decision, about, the, current, situation, they, face, critical, thinking, creates, new, possibilities, for, the, development, of, the, nursing, knowledge, due, to, the, sociocultural, environmental, and, political, issues, that, are, affecting, healthcare, delivery, it, would, be, helpful, to, embody, new, techniques, in, nursing, nurses, can, also, engage, their, critical, thinking, skills, through, the, socratic, method, of, dialogue, and, reflection, this, practice, standard, is, even, part, of, some, regulatory, organizations, such, as, the, college, of, nurses, of, ontario, s, professional, standards, for, continuing, competencies, 2006, it, requires, nurses, to, engage, in, reflective, practice, and, keep, records, of, this, continued, professional, development, for, possible, review, by, the, college, critical, thinking, is, also, considered, important, for, human, rights, education, for, toleration, the, declaration, of, principles, on, tolerance, adopted, by, unesco, in, 1995, affirms, that, education, for, tolerance, could, aim, at, countering, factors, that, lead, to, fear, and, exclusion, of, others, and, could, help, young, people, to, develop, capacities, for, independent, judgement, critical, thinking, and, ethical, reasoning, the, advent, and, rising, popularity, of, online, courses, have, prompted, some, to, ask, if, computer, mediated, communication, cmc, promotes, hinders, or, has, no, effect, on, the, amount, and, quality, of, critical, thinking, in, a, course, relative, to, face, to, face, communication, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, a, fourth, more, nuanced, possibility, that, cmc, may, promote, some, aspects, of, critical, thinking, but, hinder, others, for, example, guiller, et, al, 2008, found, that, relative, to, face, to, face, discourse, online, discourse, featured, more, justifications, while, face, to, face, discourse, featured, more, instances, of, students, expanding, on, what, others, had, said, the, increase, in, justifications, may, be, due, to, the, asynchronous, nature, of, online, discussions, while, the, increase, in, expanding, comments, may, be, due, to, the, spontaneity, of, real, time, discussion, newman, et, al, 1995, showed, similar, differential, effects, they, found, that, while, cmc, boasted, more, important, statements, and, linking, of, ideas, it, lacked, novelty, the, authors, suggest, that, this, may, be, due, to, difficulties, participating, in, a, brainstorming, style, activity, in, an, asynchronous, environment, rather, the, asynchrony, may, promote, users, to, put, forth, considered, thought, out, contributions, researchers, assessing, critical, thinking, in, online, discussion, forums, often, employ, a, technique, called, content, analysis, where, the, text, of, online, discourse, or, the, transcription, of, face, to, face, discourse, is, systematically, coded, for, different, kinds, of, statements, relating, to, critical, thinking, for, example, a, statement, might, be, coded, as, discuss, ambiguities, to, clear, them, up, or, welcoming, outside, knowledge, as, positive, indicators, of, critical, thinking, conversely, statements, reflecting, poor, critical, thinking, may, be, labeled, as, sticking, to, prejudice, or, assumptions, or, squashing, attempts, to, bring, in, outside, knowledge, the, frequency, of, these, codes, in, cmc, and, face, to, face, discourse, can, be, compared, to, draw, conclusions, about, the, quality, of, critical, thinking, searching, for, evidence, of, critical, thinking, in, discourse, has, roots, in, a, definition, of, critical, thinking, put, forth, by, kuhn, 1991, which, emphasizes, the, social, nature, of, discussion, and, knowledge, construction, there, is, limited, research, on, the, role, of, social, experience, in, critical, thinking, development, but, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, it, is, an, important, factor, for, example, research, has, shown, that, three, to, four, year, old, children, can, discern, to, some, extent, the, differential, credibility, and, expertise, of, individuals, further, evidence, for, the, impact, of, social, experience, on, the, development, of, critical, thinking, skills, comes, from, work, that, found, that, 6, to, 7, year, olds, from, china, have, similar, levels, of, skepticism, to, 10, and, 11, year, olds, in, the, united, states, if, the, development, of, critical, thinking, skills, was, solely, due, to, maturation, it, is, unlikely, we, would, see, such, dramatic, differences, across, cultures
