an, angel, is, a, spiritual, without, a, physical, body, or, heavenly, supernatural, being, it, is, often, depicted, as, a, messenger, or, intermediary, between, god, and, humanity, in, various, traditions, like, the, abrahamic, religions, other, roles, include, protectors, and, guides, for, humans, such, as, guardian, angels, and, servants, of, god, abrahamic, religions, describe, angelic, hierarchies, which, vary, by, religion, and, sect, some, angels, have, specific, names, such, as, gabriel, or, michael, or, titles, such, as, seraph, or, archangel, malevolent, angels, are, often, believed, to, have, been, expelled, from, heaven, and, called, fallen, angels, in, many, such, religions, the, devil, or, devils, are, identified, with, such, angels, angels, in, art, are, often, identified, with, bird, wings, halos, and, divine, light, they, are, usually, shaped, like, humans, of, extraordinary, beauty, though, this, is, not, always, the, case, sometimes, they, can, be, portrayed, in, a, frightening, inhuman, manner, the, word, angel, arrives, in, modern, english, from, old, english, engel, with, a, hard, g, and, the, old, french, angele, both, of, these, derive, from, late, latin, angelus, which, in, turn, was, borrowed, from, late, greek, angelos, literally, messenger, he, word, s, earliest, form, is, mycenaean, a, ke, ro, attested, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, according, to, the, dutch, linguist, r, s, p, beekes, ngelos, itself, may, be, an, oriental, loan, like, ngaros, persian, mounted, courier, the, rendering, of, ngelos, is, the, septuagint, s, default, translation, of, the, biblical, hebrew, term, mal, kh, denoting, simply, messenger, without, connoting, its, nature, in, the, latin, vulgate, this, meaning, becomes, bifurcated, when, mal, kh, or, ngelos, is, supposed, to, denote, a, human, messenger, words, like, nuntius, or, legatus, are, applied, if, the, word, refers, to, some, supernatural, being, the, word, angelus, appears, such, differentiation, has, been, taken, over, by, later, vernacular, translations, of, the, bible, early, christian, and, jewish, exegetes, and, eventually, modern, scholars, the, concept, of, angels, is, historically, best, to, be, understood, from, different, ideas, of, the, concept, of, god, throughout, history, in, polytheistic, and, animistic, worldviews, supernatural, powers, i, e, deities, spirits, daemons, etc, were, assigned, to, different, natural, phenomena, p102, within, a, monotheistic, framework, these, powers, were, reconsidered, to, be, servants, of, the, supreme, deity, turning, autonomous, supernatural, beings, into, angels, p102, by, that, supernatural, powers, controlling, or, influencing, humanities, perception, of, the, world, including, natural, phenomena, and, humans, are, ultimately, under, control, of, a, supreme, god, p102, prominent, angels, such, as, michael, and, gabriel, reflect, a, connection, to, the, chief, semitic, deity, el, even, bad, angels, such, as, satan, samael, iblis, etc, can, be, understood, as, an, operating, force, within, the, nature, of, humans, as, responsible, for, selfish, tendencies, p102, the, idea, of, angels, in, early, hebrew, scripture, as, supernatural, agents, is, absent, instead, the, hebrew, deity, intervenes, in, human, affairs, mostly, by, means, of, punishment, only, in, later, thought, of, post, exilic, and, prophetic, writings, the, biblical, deity, is, conceptualized, as, distant, and, more, merciful, his, interventions, replaced, by, the, idea, of, angels, however, such, angels, still, carry, out, the, gruesome, attributes, of, god, and, can, be, both, benevolent, and, malevolent, the, notion, of, angels, as, embodiment, of, good, emerges, only, under, influence, of, zoroastrianism, in, which, the, devil, is, conceived, as, the, principle, of, evil, with, a, hosts, of, demons, in, battle, with, the, holy, entities, am, a, sp, ta, created, by, ahura, mazda, principle, of, good, influence, of, dualistic, tendencies, and, replacement, of, divine, powers, by, angels, is, evident, from, the, qumram, writings, in, the, angelic, liturgy, the, hebrew, term, elim, deities, heavenly, powers, is, used, for, angelic, beings, and, not, for, god, p23, the, war, scroll, speaks, about, angels, of, light, fighting, against, demonic, beings, of, darkness, p20, in, zoroastrianism, there, are, different, angel, like, figures, for, example, each, person, has, one, guardian, angel, called, fravashi, they, patronize, human, beings, and, other, creatures, and, also, manifest, god, s, energy, the, amesha, spentas, have, often, been, regarded, as, angels, although, there, is, no, direct, reference, to, them, conveying, messages, but, are, rather, emanations, of, ahura, mazda, wise, lord, god, they, initially, appeared, in, an, abstract, fashion, and, then, later, became, personalized, associated, with, various, aspects, of, creation, in, judaism, angels, hebrew, mal, messenger, are, understood, through, interpretation, of, the, tanakh, and, in, a, long, tradition, as, supernatural, beings, who, stand, by, god, in, heaven, but, are, strictly, to, be, distinguished, from, god, yhwh, and, are, subordinate, to, him, occasionally, they, can, show, selected, people, god, s, will, and, instructions, in, the, jewish, tradition, they, are, also, inferior, to, humans, since, they, have, no, will, of, their, own, and, are, able, to, carry, out, only, one, divine, command, the, torah, uses, the, hebrew, terms, mal, k, l, h, m, messenger, of, god, mal, k, yahweh, messenger, of, the, lord, b, n, l, h, m, sons, of, god, and, haqq, d, m, the, holy, ones, to, refer, to, beings, traditionally, interpreted, as, angels, later, texts, use, other, terms, such, as, h, ely, n, m, the, upper, ones, the, term, mal, k, is, also, used, in, other, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, in, the, early, stages, of, hebrew, writings, the, term, refers, to, human, messengers, not, to, supernatural, entities, a, human, messenger, might, be, a, prophet, or, priest, such, as, malachi, my, messenger, the, greek, superscription, in, the, septuagint, translation, states, the, book, of, malachi, was, written, by, the, hand, of, his, messenger, ang, lu, examples, of, a, supernatural, messenger, are, the, malak, yhwh, who, is, either, a, messenger, from, god, an, aspect, of, god, such, as, the, logos, or, god, himself, as, the, messenger, the, theophanic, angel, michael, d, coogan, notes, that, it, is, only, in, the, late, books, that, the, terms, come, to, mean, the, benevolent, semi, divine, beings, familiar, from, later, mythology, and, art, daniel, is, the, biblical, book, to, refer, to, individual, angels, by, name, mentioning, gabriel, in, daniel, 9, 21, and, michael, in, daniel, 10, 13, these, angels, are, part, of, daniel, s, apocalyptic, visions, and, are, an, important, part, of, apocalyptic, literature, in, daniel, 7, daniel, receives, a, dream, vision, from, god, as, daniel, watches, the, ancient, of, days, takes, his, seat, on, the, throne, of, heaven, and, sits, in, judgement, in, the, midst, of, the, heavenly, court, an, like, a, son, of, man, approaches, the, ancient, one, in, the, clouds, of, heaven, and, is, given, everlasting, kingship, coogan, explains, the, development, of, this, concept, of, angels, in, the, postexilic, period, with, the, development, of, explicit, monotheism, these, divine, beings, the, sons, of, god, who, were, members, of, the, divine, council, were, in, effect, demoted, to, what, are, now, known, as, angels, understood, as, beings, created, by, god, but, immortal, and, thus, superior, to, humans, this, conception, of, angels, is, best, understood, in, contrast, to, demons, and, is, often, thought, to, be, influenced, by, the, ancient, persian, religious, tradition, of, zoroastrianism, which, viewed, the, world, as, a, battleground, between, forces, of, good, and, forces, of, evil, between, light, and, darkness, one, of, these, is, h, n, a, figure, depicted, in, among, other, places, the, book, of, job, according, to, rabbinic, judaism, the, angels, have, no, bodies, but, are, eternally, living, creatures, created, out, of, fire, the, babylonian, talmud, reads, as, the, torah, was, not, given, to, ministering, angels, usually, understood, as, a, concession, to, human, s, imperfection, in, contrast, to, the, angels, thus, they, occasionally, appear, in, midrashim, as, competition, with, humans, the, angels, as, heavenly, beings, strictly, following, the, laws, of, god, become, jealous, of, god, s, affection, for, man, humans, by, following, the, torah, in, prayer, by, resisting, evil, instincts, yetzer, hara, and, by, teshuva, are, preferred, to, the, flawless, angels, as, a, result, they, are, also, inferior, to, humans, in, the, jewish, tradition, in, the, midrash, the, plural, of, el, elohim, used, in, genesis, in, relation, to, the, creation, of, human, beings, is, explained, by, the, presence, of, angels, god, therefore, consulted, with, the, angels, but, made, the, final, decision, alone, this, story, serves, as, an, example, teaching, that, the, powerful, should, also, consult, with, the, weak, god, s, own, final, decision, highlights, god, s, undisputable, omnipotence, in, post, biblical, judaism, certain, angels, took, on, particular, significance, and, developed, unique, personalities, and, roles, although, these, archangels, were, believed, to, rank, among, the, heavenly, host, no, systematic, hierarchy, ever, developed, metatron, is, considered, one, of, the, highest, of, the, angels, in, merkabah, and, kabbalah, mysticism, and, often, serves, as, a, scribe, he, is, briefly, mentioned, in, the, talmud, and, figures, prominently, in, merkabah, mystical, texts, michael, who, serves, as, a, warrior, and, advocate, for, israel, daniel, 10, 13, is, looked, upon, particularly, fondly, gabriel, is, mentioned, in, the, book, of, daniel, daniel, 8, 15, 17, and, briefly, in, the, talmud, as, well, as, in, many, merkabah, mystical, texts, there, is, no, evidence, in, judaism, for, the, worship, of, angels, but, there, is, evidence, for, the, invocation, and, sometimes, even, conjuration, of, angels, philo, of, alexandria, identifies, the, angel, with, the, logos, inasmuch, as, the, angel, is, the, immaterial, voice, of, god, the, angel, is, something, different, from, god, himself, but, is, conceived, as, god, s, instrument, four, classes, of, ministering, angels, minister, and, utter, praise, before, the, holy, one, blessed, be, he, the, first, camp, led, by, michael, on, his, right, the, second, camp, led, by, gabriel, on, his, left, the, third, camp, led, by, uriel, before, him, and, the, fourth, camp, led, by, raphael, behind, him, and, the, shekhinah, of, the, holy, one, blessed, be, he, is, in, the, centre, he, is, sitting, on, a, throne, high, and, exalted, according, to, kabbalah, there, are, four, worlds, and, our, world, is, the, last, world, the, world, of, action, assiyah, angels, exist, in, the, worlds, above, as, a, task, of, god, they, are, an, extension, of, god, to, produce, effects, in, this, world, after, an, angel, has, completed, its, task, it, ceases, to, exist, the, angel, is, in, effect, the, task, this, is, derived, from, the, book, of, genesis, when, abraham, meets, with, three, angels, and, lot, meets, with, two, the, task, of, one, of, the, angels, was, to, inform, sara, and, abraham, of, their, coming, child, the, other, two, were, to, save, lot, and, to, destroy, sodom, and, gomorrah, jewish, philosopher, maimonides, explained, his, view, of, angels, in, his, guide, for, the, perplexed, ii, 4, and, ii, this, leads, aristotle, in, turn, to, the, demonstrated, fact, that, god, glory, and, majesty, to, him, does, not, do, things, by, direct, contact, god, burns, things, by, means, of, fire, fire, is, moved, by, the, motion, of, the, sphere, the, sphere, is, moved, by, means, of, a, disembodied, intellect, these, intellects, being, the, angels, which, are, near, to, him, through, whose, mediation, the, spheres, move, thus, totally, disembodied, minds, exist, which, emanate, from, god, and, are, the, intermediaries, between, god, and, all, the, bodies, here, in, this, world, maimonides, had, a, neo, aristotelian, interpretation, of, the, bible, maimonides, writes, that, to, the, wise, man, one, sees, that, what, the, bible, and, talmud, refer, to, as, angels, are, actually, allusions, to, the, various, laws, of, nature, they, are, the, principles, by, which, the, physical, universe, operates, for, all, forces, are, angels, how, blind, how, perniciously, blind, are, the, naive, if, you, told, someone, who, purports, to, be, a, sage, of, israel, that, the, deity, sends, an, angel, who, enters, a, woman, s, womb, and, there, forms, an, embryo, he, would, think, this, a, miracle, and, accept, it, as, a, mark, of, the, majesty, and, power, of, the, deity, despite, the, fact, that, he, believes, an, angel, to, be, a, body, of, fire, one, third, the, size, of, the, entire, world, all, this, he, thinks, is, possible, for, god, but, if, you, tell, him, that, god, placed, in, the, sperm, the, power, of, forming, and, demarcating, these, organs, and, that, this, is, the, angel, or, that, all, forms, are, produced, by, the, active, intellect, that, here, is, the, angel, the, vice, regent, of, the, world, constantly, mentioned, by, the, sages, then, he, will, recoil, guide, for, the, perplexed, ii, 4, from, the, jewish, encyclopedia, entry, angelology, only, these, two, angels, are, mentioned, by, name, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, names, of, the, others, are, from, jewish, apocrypha, post, exilic, or, talmudic, lore, in, the, early, stage, the, christian, concept, of, an, angel, characterized, the, angel, as, a, messenger, of, god, the, word, angel, can, be, drawn, to, the, term, or, role, of, a, messenger, throughout, the, bible, in, both, old, and, new, testaments, hebrews, 1, 14, calls, them, ministering, spirits, sent, by, god, to, aid, the, heirs, of, salvation, later, came, identification, of, individual, angelic, messengers, gabriel, michael, raphael, and, uriel, then, in, the, space, of, slightly, over, two, centuries, from, the, 3rd, to, the, 5th, the, image, of, angels, took, on, definite, characteristics, both, in, theology, and, in, art, ellen, muehlberger, has, argued, that, in, late, antiquity, angels, were, conceived, of, as, one, type, of, being, among, many, whose, primary, purpose, was, to, guard, and, to, guide, christians, angels, are, represented, throughout, bibles, as, spiritual, beings, which, are, intermediate, between, god, and, humanity, for, thou, hast, made, him, a, little, lower, than, the, angels, and, hast, crowned, him, with, glory, and, honour, psalms, 8, 4, 5, christians, based, on, psalms, and, genesis, 2, 1, believe, that, angels, were, the, first, beings, created, by, god, before, the, creation, of, earth, psalms, 148, 2, 5, colossians, 1, 16, greek, translations, of, the, hebrew, bible, refer, to, intermediary, beings, as, angels, instead, of, daimons, thus, giving, raise, to, a, distinction, between, demons, and, angels, in, the, old, testament, both, benevolent, and, fierce, angels, are, mentioned, but, never, called, demons, the, symmetry, lies, between, angels, sent, by, god, and, intermediary, spirits, of, foreign, deities, not, in, good, and, evil, deeds, in, the, new, testament, the, existence, of, angels, just, like, that, of, demons, is, taken, for, granted, they, can, intervene, and, intercede, on, behalf, of, humans, angels, protect, the, righteous, matthew, 4, 6, luke, 4, 11, they, dwell, in, the, heavens, matthew, 28, 2, john, 1, 51, act, as, god, s, warriors, matthew, 26, 53, and, worship, god, luke, 2, 13, in, the, parable, of, the, rich, man, and, lazarus, angels, behave, as, psychopomps, the, resurrection, of, jesus, features, angels, telling, the, woman, that, jesus, is, no, longer, in, the, tomb, but, has, risen, from, the, dead, forget, not, to, show, love, unto, strangers, for, thereby, some, have, entertained, angels, unawares, hebrews, 13, 2, according, to, jesus, statement, angels, of, heaven, don, t, marry, matthew, 22, 30, mark, 12, 25, and, luke, 20, 34, 46, three, separate, cases, of, angelic, interaction, deal, with, the, births, of, john, the, baptist, and, jesus, in, luke, 1, 11, an, angel, appears, to, zechariah, to, inform, him, that, he, will, have, a, child, despite, his, old, age, thus, proclaiming, the, birth, of, john, the, baptist, in, luke, 1, 26, gabriel, visits, mary, in, the, annunciation, to, foretell, the, birth, of, jesus, angels, proclaim, the, birth, of, jesus, in, the, adoration, of, the, shepherds, in, luke, 2, 10, according, to, matthew, 4, 11, after, jesus, spent, 40, days, in, the, desert, the, devil, left, him, and, behold, angels, came, and, ministered, to, him, in, luke, 22, 43, an, angel, comforts, jesus, during, the, agony, in, the, garden, in, matthew, 28, 5, an, angel, speaks, at, the, empty, tomb, following, the, resurrection, of, jesus, and, the, rolling, back, of, the, stone, by, angels, in, 1851, pope, pius, ix, approved, the, chaplet, of, saint, michael, based, on, the, 1751, reported, private, revelation, from, archangel, michael, to, the, carmelite, nun, antonia, d, astonac, in, a, biography, of, gemma, galgani, written, by, germanus, ruoppolo, galgani, stated, that, she, had, spoken, with, her, guardian, angel, pope, john, paul, ii, emphasized, the, role, of, angels, in, catholic, teachings, in, his, 1986, address, titled, angels, participate, in, history, of, salvation, in, which, he, suggested, that, modern, mentality, should, come, to, see, the, importance, of, angels, according, to, the, vatican, s, congregation, for, divine, worship, and, the, discipline, of, the, sacraments, the, practice, of, assigning, names, to, the, holy, angels, should, be, discouraged, except, in, the, cases, of, gabriel, raphael, and, michael, whose, names, are, contained, in, holy, scripture, according, to, augustine, of, hippo, the, term, angel, refers, to, the, name, of, their, office, not, their, nature, as, they, are, pure, spirits, who, act, as, messengers, clarifying, if, you, seek, the, name, of, their, nature, it, is, spirit, if, you, seek, the, name, of, their, office, it, is, angel, from, what, they, are, spirit, from, what, they, do, angel, gregory, of, nazianzus, thought, that, angels, were, made, as, spirits, and, flames, of, fire, following, hebrews, 1, and, that, they, can, be, identified, with, the, thrones, dominions, rulers, and, authorities, of, colossians, 1, by, the, late, 4th, century, the, church, fathers, agreed, that, there, were, different, categories, of, angels, with, appropriate, missions, and, activities, assigned, to, them, there, was, however, some, disagreement, regarding, the, nature, of, angels, some, argued, that, angels, had, physical, bodies, while, some, maintained, that, they, were, entirely, spiritual, some, theologians, had, proposed, that, angels, were, not, divine, but, on, the, level, of, immaterial, beings, subordinate, to, the, trinity, the, resolution, of, this, trinitarian, dispute, included, the, development, of, doctrine, about, angels, forty, gospel, homilies, by, pope, gregory, i, c, 540, 12, march, 604, noted, angels, and, archangels, the, fourth, lateran, council, s, 1215, firmiter, credimus, decree, issued, against, the, albigenses, declared, that, the, angels, were, created, beings, and, that, men, were, created, after, them, the, first, vatican, council, 1869, repeated, this, declaration, in, dei, filius, the, dogmatic, constitution, on, the, catholic, faith, in, the, middle, ages, theologians, had, to, address, augustine, s, ideas, of, angelic, knowledge, as, set, out, in, de, genesi, ad, litteram, which, he, divided, into, morning, knowledge, knowledge, of, creation, before, it, is, created, derived, from, direct, access, to, the, word, of, god, and, evening, knowledge, knowledge, of, creation, derived, from, perceiving, it, after, it, has, been, created, thomas, aquinas, 13th, century, related, angels, to, aristotle, s, metaphysics, in, his, summa, contra, gentiles, summa, theologica, the, 8th, question, of, quaestiones, disputatae, de, veritate, and, in, de, substantiis, separatis, a, treatise, on, angelology, aquinas, varied, significantly, from, the, augustinian, view, in, two, major, respects, angels, were, not, created, in, an, initial, state, of, bliss, and, only, beatified, angels, have, morning, knowledge, in, other, words, angels, have, an, angelic, nature, but, in, their, natural, states, have, no, access, to, divine, morning, knowledge, of, creation, which, they, only, gain, with, supernatural, assistance, this, was, aquinas, most, original, contribution, to, christian, angelology, although, angels, have, greater, knowledge, than, men, they, are, not, omniscient, as, matthew, 24, 36, points, out, according, to, the, summa, theologica, angels, were, created, instantaneously, by, god, in, a, state, of, grace, in, the, empyrean, heaven, lxi, 4, at, the, same, time, when, he, created, all, the, contents, of, the, corporeal, world, lxi, 3, they, are, pure, spirits, whose, life, consists, in, knowledge, and, love, being, bodiless, their, knowledge, is, intellectual, and, not, through, senses, liv, 5, differently, from, humans, their, knowledge, is, not, acquired, from, the, exterior, world, having, acquired, all, knowledge, they, would, ever, receive, in, the, moment, of, their, creation, moreover, they, attain, to, the, truth, of, a, thing, at, a, single, glance, without, need, of, reasoning, lv, a, lviii, 3, 4, they, know, all, that, passes, in, the, external, world, lv, 2, and, the, totality, of, creatures, but, they, don, t, know, human, secret, thoughts, that, depends, on, human, free, will, and, thereby, are, not, necessarily, linked, up, with, external, events, lvii, 4, they, don, t, know, also, the, future, unless, god, reveals, it, to, them, lvii, 3, according, to, aquinas, angels, are, the, closest, creatures, to, god, therefore, like, god, they, are, constituted, by, pure, form, without, matter, while, they, do, not, have, a, physical, composition, of, matter, and, form, called, ilemorphysm, they, possess, the, metaphysical, composition, of, act, the, act, of, being, and, potency, their, finite, essence, yet, without, being, each, angel, is, a, species, which, a, unique, individual, belongs, to, angels, differ, one, from, another, by, way, of, their, unique, and, irrepetible, form, in, other, words, form, and, not, matter, is, their, principle, of, individuation, the, new, church, denominations, that, arose, from, the, writings, of, theologian, emanuel, swedenborg, have, distinct, ideas, about, angels, and, the, spiritual, world, in, which, they, dwell, adherents, believe, that, all, angels, are, in, human, form, with, a, spiritual, body, and, are, not, just, minds, without, form, there, are, different, orders, of, angels, according, to, the, three, heavens, and, each, angel, dwells, in, one, of, innumerable, societies, of, angels, such, a, society, of, angels, can, appear, as, one, angel, as, a, whole, all, angels, originate, from, the, human, race, and, there, is, not, one, angel, in, heaven, who, first, did, not, live, in, a, material, body, moreover, all, children, who, die, not, only, enter, heaven, but, eventually, become, angels, the, life, of, angels, is, that, of, usefulness, and, their, functions, are, so, many, that, they, cannot, be, enumerated, however, each, angel, will, enter, a, service, according, to, the, use, that, they, had, performed, in, their, earthly, life, names, of, angels, such, as, michael, gabriel, and, raphael, signify, a, particular, angelic, function, rather, than, an, individual, being, while, living, in, one, s, body, an, individual, has, conjunction, with, heaven, through, the, angels, and, with, each, person, there, are, at, least, two, evil, spirits, and, two, angels, temptation, or, pains, of, conscience, originates, from, a, conflict, between, evil, spirits, and, angels, due, to, man, s, sinful, nature, it, is, dangerous, to, have, open, direct, communication, with, angels, and, they, can, only, be, seen, when, one, s, spiritual, sight, has, been, opened, thus, from, moment, to, moment, angels, attempt, to, lead, each, person, to, what, is, good, tacitly, using, the, person, s, own, thoughts, the, latter, day, saint, movement, views, angels, as, the, messengers, of, god, they, are, sent, to, mankind, to, deliver, messages, minister, to, humanity, teach, doctrines, of, salvation, call, mankind, to, repentance, give, priesthood, keys, save, individuals, in, perilous, times, and, guide, humankind, latter, day, saints, believe, that, angels, either, are, the, spirits, of, humans, who, are, deceased, or, who, have, yet, to, be, born, or, are, humans, who, have, been, resurrected, or, translated, and, have, physical, bodies, of, flesh, and, bones, joseph, smith, taught, that, there, are, no, angels, who, minister, to, this, earth, but, those, that, do, belong, or, have, belonged, to, it, as, such, latter, day, saints, also, believe, that, adam, the, first, man, was, and, is, now, the, archangel, michael, and, that, gabriel, lived, on, the, earth, as, noah, likewise, the, angel, moroni, first, lived, in, a, pre, columbian, american, civilization, as, the, 5th, century, prophet, warrior, named, moroni, smith, described, his, first, angelic, encounter, in, the, following, manner, while, i, was, thus, in, the, act, of, calling, upon, god, i, discovered, a, light, appearing, in, my, room, which, continued, to, increase, until, the, room, was, lighter, than, at, noonday, when, immediately, a, personage, appeared, at, my, bedside, standing, in, the, air, for, his, feet, did, not, touch, the, floor, he, had, on, a, loose, robe, of, most, exquisite, whiteness, it, was, a, whiteness, beyond, anything, earthly, i, had, ever, seen, nor, do, i, believe, that, any, earthly, thing, could, be, made, to, appear, so, exceedingly, white, and, brilliant, not, only, was, his, robe, exceedingly, white, but, his, whole, person, was, glorious, beyond, description, and, his, countenance, truly, like, lightning, the, room, was, exceedingly, light, but, not, so, very, bright, as, immediately, around, his, person, when, i, first, looked, upon, him, i, was, afraid, but, the, fear, soon, left, me, most, angelic, visitations, in, the, early, latter, day, saint, movement, were, witnessed, by, smith, and, oliver, cowdery, who, both, said, prior, to, the, establishment, of, the, church, in, 1830, they, had, been, visited, by, the, prophet, moroni, john, the, baptist, and, the, apostles, peter, james, and, john, later, after, the, dedication, of, the, kirtland, temple, smith, and, cowdery, said, they, had, been, visited, by, jesus, and,

other, latter, day, saints, both, in, the, early, and, modern, church, have, said, they, had, seen, angels, although, smith, posited, that, except, in, extenuating, circumstances, such, as, the, restoration, mortals, teach, mortals, spirits, teach, spirits, and, resurrected, beings, teach, other, resurrected, beings, belief, in, angels, is, fundamental, to, islam, the, quranic, word, for,

or, m, l, k, with, the, broad, meaning, of, a, messenger, just, like, its, counterparts, in, hebrew, mal, kh, and, greek, angelos, unlike, their, hebrew, counterpart, the, term, is, exclusively, used, for, heavenly, spirits, of, the, divine, world, but, not, for, human, messengers, the, quran, refers, to, both, angelic, and, human, messengers, as, rasul, instead, the, quran, is, the, principal, source, for, the, islamic, concept, of, angels, some, of, them, such, as, gabriel, and, michael, are, mentioned, by, name, in, the, quran, others, are, only, referred, to, by, their, function, most, muslim, theologians, such, as, al, suyuti, based, on, a, hadith, stating, that, the, angels, have, been, created, through, the, light, n, r, depict, angels, as, entities, consisting, of, substance, in, contrast, to, philosophers, who, argued, for, angels, being, disembodied, spirits, additionally, angels, are, thought, to, be, endowed, with, reason, and, be, subject, to, god, s, tests, al, maturidi, 853, 944, ce, states, that, the, inhabitants, of, heaven, were, tested, by, adorenments, just, as, humans, and, jinn, on, earth, were, tested, pointing, at, s, rat, al, kahf, when, angels, fail, their, tests, they, might, end, up, on, earth, such, as, harut, and, marut, if, the, devils, ay, n, have, been, angels, once, or, form, a, separate, type, of, creature, from, the, beginning, is, discussed, in, islamic, tradition, contrary, to, popular, belief, angels, are, never, described, as, agents, of, revelation, in, the, quran, although, interpretation, credits, gabriel, with, that, angels, are, not, limited, to, benevolent, tasks, but, can, also, carry, out, grim, orders, not, demons, but, angels, are, tasked, to, guard, and, punish, sinners, in, hell, angels, play, a, significant, role, in, mi, raj, literature, where, muhammad, encounters, several, angels, during, his, journey, through, the, heavens, further, angels, have, often, been, featured, in, islamic, eschatology, islamic, theology, and, islamic, philosophy, individual, angels, are, further, evoked, in, exorcism, rites, with, their, names, engraved, in, talismans, or, amulets, to, call, upon, their, powers, islamic, theology, usually, distinguishes, between, three, types, of, invisible, creatures, angels, mal, ikah, djinn, and, devils, ay, n, islamic, theologian, al, ghazali, c, 1058, 1111, divides, human, nature, into, four, domains, each, representing, another, type, of, creature, animals, beasts, devils, and, angels, reconciling, the, literal, meaning, hir, with, the, avicennan,

represent, the, intellectual, capacity, of, a, human, and, the, ability, to, bound, the, devilish, qualities, from, within, by, that, ghazali, does, not, deny, the, literal, reality, of, angels, but, rejects, that, they, could, be, perceived, directly, although, belief, in, angels, remains, one, of, six, articles, of, faith, in, islam, one, can, not, find, a, dogmatic, angelology, in, islamic, tradition, however, theologians, generally, distinguish, between, the, angels, in, heaven, karubiyin, fully, absorbed, in, the, ma, rifa, knowledge, of, god, and, the, messengers, ras, l, who, carry, out, divine, decrees, between, heaven, and, earth, others, add, a, third, group, of, angels, and, categorize, angels, into, lliyy, n, mukarreb, n, those, around, god, s, throne, mudabbir, t, carrying,

based, on, they, laud, night, and, day, they, never, wane, 21, 29, they, are, the, highmost, and, angels, brought, near, and, those, who, are, the, executors, of, commands, based, on, they, do, not, disobey, allah, in, what, he, commanded, them, but, they, do, what, they, are, commanded, 66, 6, who, are, the, administers, of, the, command, of, heaven, to, earth, 509, some, modern, scholars, have, emphasized, a, metaphorical, reinterpretation, of, the, concept, of, angels, salafism, and, wahhabism, generally, emphasize, a, literal, interpretation, of, angels, against, modernistic, interpretations, as, for, example, suggested, by, nasr, abu, zayd, simultaneously, many, traditional, materials, regarding, angels, accepted, during, the, classical, period, are, often, disregarded, by, wahhabis, and, salafis, the, muslim, brotherhood, scholars, sayyid, qutb, and, umar, sulaiman, al, ashqar, reject, much, established, material, during, earlier, periods, for, example, the, story, of, harut, and, marut, or, calling, the, angel, of, death, azrail, sulayman, ashqar, not, only, rejects, the, traditional, material, itself, but, also, disapproves, of, previous, scholars, who, used, such, reports, in, islam, just, like, in, judaism, and, christianity, angels, are, often, represented, in, anthropomorphic, forms, combined, with, supernatural, images, such, as, wings, being, of, great, size, or, wearing, heavenly, articles, the, quran, describes, them, as, messengers, with, wings, two, or, three, or, four, he, adds, to, creation, as, he, pleases, the, 13th, century, book, aj,

incarnated, as, human, beings, it, is, believed, by, theosophists, that, nature, spirits, elementals, gnomes, undines, sylphs, and, salamanders, and, fairies, also, can, be, observed, when, the, third, eye, is, activated, it, is, maintained, by, theosophists, that, these, less, evolutionarily, developed, beings, have, never, been, previously, incarnated, as, humans, they, are, regarded, as, being, on, a, separate, line, of, spiritual, evolution, called, the, deva, evolution, eventually, as, their, souls, advance, as, they, reincarnate, it, is, believed, they, will, incarnate, as, devas,

are, wholly, spiritual, beings, and, therefore, do, not, eat, excrete, or, have, sex, and, have, no, gender, although, their, different, roles, such, as, warriors, for, some, archangels, may, suggest, a, human, gender, christian, artists, were, careful, not, to, given, them, specific, gender, attributes, at, least, until, the, 19th, century, when, some, acquire, breasts, for, example, in, an, address, during, a, general, audience, of, 6, august, 1986, entitled, angels, participate, in, the, history, of, salvation, pope, john, paul, ii, explained, that, he, angels, have, no, body, even, if, in, particular, circumstances, they, reveal, themselves, under, visible, forms, because, of, their, mission, for, the, good, of, people, christian, art, perhaps, reflects, the, descriptions, in, revelation, 4, 6, 8, of, the, four, living, creatures, greek, and, the, descriptions, in, the, hebrew, bible, of, cherubim, and, seraphim, the, chayot, in, ezekiel, s, merkabah, vision, and, the, seraphim, of, isaiah, however, while, cherubim, and, seraphim, have, wings, in, the, bible, no, angel, is, mentioned, as, having, wings, the, earliest, known, christian, image, of, an, angel, in, the, cubicolo, dell, annunziazione, in, the, catacomb, of, priscilla, mid, 3rd, century, is, without, wings, in, that, same, period, representations, of, angels, on, sarcophagi, lamps, and, reliquaries, also, show, them, without, wings, as, for, example, the, angel, in, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, scene, in, the, sarcophagus, of, junius, bassus, although, the, side, view, of, the, sarcophagus, shows, winged, angelic, figures, the, earliest, known, representation, of, angels, with, wings, is, on, the, prince, s, sarcophagus, attributed, to, the, time, of, theodosius, i, 379, 395, discovered, at, sarig, zel, near, istanbul, in, the, 1930s, from, that, period, on, christian, art, has, represented, angels, mostly, with, wings, as, in, the, cycle, of, mosaics, in, the, basilica, of, saint, mary, major, 432, 440, four, and, six, winged, angels, drawn, from, the, higher, grades, of, angels, especially, cherubim, and, seraphim, and, often, showing, only, their, faces, and, wings, are, derived, from, persian, art, and, are, usually, shown, only, in, heavenly, contexts, as, opposed, to, performing, tasks, on, earth, they, often, appear, in, the, pendentives, of, church, domes, or, semi, domes, prior, to, the, judeo, christian, tradition, in, the, greek, world, the, goddess, nike, and, the, gods, eros, and, thanatos, were, also, depicted, in, human, like, form, with, wings, john, chrysostom, explained, the, significance, of, angels, wings, they, manifest, a, nature, s, sublimity, that, is, why, gabriel, is, represented, with, wings, not, that, angels, have, wings, but, that, you, may, know, that, they, leave, the, heights, and, the, most, elevated, dwelling, to, approach, human, nature, accordingly, the, wings, attributed, to, these, powers, have, no, other, meaning, than, to, indicate, the, sublimity, of, their, nature, angels, are, typically, depicted, in, mormon, art, as, having, no, wings, based, on, a, quote, from, joseph, smith, an, angel, of, god, never, has, wings, in, terms, of, their, clothing, angels, especially, the, archangel, michael, were, depicted, as, military, style, agents, of, god, and, came, to, be, shown, wearing, late, antique, military, uniform, this, uniform, could, be, the, normal, military, dress, with, a, tunic, to, about, the, knees, an, armour, breastplate, and, pteruges, but, was, often, the, specific, dress, of, the, bodyguard, of, the, byzantine, emperor, with, a, long, tunic, and, the, loros, the, long, gold, and, jewelled, pallium, restricted, to, the, imperial, family, and, their, closest, guards, the, basic, military, dress, was, shown, in, western, art, into, the, baroque, period, and, beyond, see, reni, picture, above, and, up, to, the, present, day, in, eastern, orthodox, icons, other, angels, came, to, be, conventionally, depicted, in, long, robes, and, in, the, later, middle, ages, they, often, wear, the, vestments, of, a, deacon, a, cope, over, a, dalmatic, this, costume, was, used, especially, for, gabriel, in, annunciation, scenes, for, example, the, annunciation, in, washington, by, jan, van, eyck, some, types, of, angels, are, described, as, possessing, more, unusual, or, frightening, attributes, such, as, the, fiery, bodies, of, the, seraphim, and, the, wheel, like, structures, of, the, ophanim
