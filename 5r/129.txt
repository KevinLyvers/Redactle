a, creation, myth, or, cosmogonic, myth, is, a, type, of, cosmogony, a, symbolic, narrative, of, how, the, world, began, and, how, people, first, came, to, inhabit, it, while, in, popular, usage, the, term, myth, often, refers, to, false, or, fanciful, stories, members, of, cultures, often, ascribe, varying, degrees, of, truth, to, their, creation, myths, in, the, society, in, which, it, is, told, a, creation, myth, is, usually, regarded, as, conveying, profound, truths, metaphorically, symbolically, historically, or, literally, they, are, commonly, although, not, always, considered, cosmogonical, myths, that, is, they, describe, the, ordering, of, the, cosmos, from, a, state, of, chaos, or, amorphousness, creation, myths, often, share, several, features, they, often, are, considered, sacred, accounts, and, can, be, found, in, nearly, all, known, religious, traditions, they, are, all, stories, with, a, plot, and, characters, who, are, either, deities, human, like, figures, or, animals, who, often, speak, and, transform, easily, they, are, often, set, in, a, dim, and, nonspecific, past, that, historian, of, religion, mircea, eliade, termed, in, illo, tempore, at, that, time, creation, myths, address, questions, deeply, meaningful, to, the, society, that, shares, them, revealing, their, central, worldview, and, the, framework, for, the, self, identity, of, the, culture, and, individual, in, a, universal, context, creation, myths, develop, in, oral, traditions, and, therefore, typically, have, multiple, versions, found, throughout, human, culture, they, are, the, most, common, form, of, myth, creation, myth, definitions, from, modern, references, religion, professor, mircea, eliade, defined, the, word, myth, in, terms, of, creation, myth, narrates, a, sacred, history, it, relates, an, event, that, took, place, in, primordial, time, the, fabled, time, of, the, beginnings, in, other, words, myth, tells, how, through, the, deeds, of, supernatural, beings, a, reality, came, into, existence, be, it, the, whole, of, reality, the, cosmos, or, only, a, fragment, of, reality, an, island, a, species, of, plant, a, particular, kind, of, human, behavior, an, institution, creation, myths, have, been, around, since, ancient, history, and, have, served, important, societal, roles, over, 100, distinct, ones, have, been, discovered, all, creation, myths, are, in, one, sense, etiological, because, they, attempt, to, explain, how, the, world, formed, and, where, humanity, came, from, myths, attempt, to, explain, the, unknown, and, sometimes, teach, a, lesson, ethnologists, and, anthropologists, who, study, origin, myths, say, that, in, the, modern, context, theologians, try, to, discern, humanity, s, meaning, from, revealed, truths, and, scientists, investigate, cosmology, with, the, tools, of, empiricism, and, rationality, but, creation, myths, define, human, reality, in, very, different, terms, in, the, past, historians, of, religion, and, other, students, of, myth, thought, of, such, stories, as, forms, of, primitive, or, early, stage, science, or, religion, and, analyzed, them, in, a, literal, or, logical, sense, today, however, they, are, seen, as, symbolic, narratives, which, must, be, understood, in, terms, of, their, own, cultural, context, charles, long, writes, the, beings, referred, to, in, the, myth, gods, animals, plants, are, forms, of, power, grasped, existentially, the, myths, should, not, be, understood, as, attempts, to, work, out, a, rational, explanation, of, deity, while, creation, myths, are, not, literal, explications, they, do, serve, to, define, an, orientation, of, humanity, in, the, world, in, terms, of, a, birth, story, they, provide, the, basis, of, a, worldview, that, reaffirms, and, guides, how, people, relate, to, the, natural, world, to, any, assumed, spiritual, world, and, to, each, other, a, creation, myth, acts, as, a, cornerstone, for, distinguishing, primary, reality, from, relative, reality, the, origin, and, nature, of, being, from, non, being, in, this, sense, cosmogonic, myths, serve, as, a, philosophy, of, life, but, one, expressed, and, conveyed, through, symbol, rather, than, through, systematic, reason, and, in, this, sense, they, go, beyond, etiological, myths, which, explain, specific, features, in, religious, rites, natural, phenomena, or, cultural, life, creation, myths, also, help, to, orient, human, beings, in, the, world, giving, them, a, sense, of, their, place, in, the, world, and, the, regard, that, they, must, have, for, humans, and, nature, historian, david, christian, has, summarised, issues, common, to, multiple, creation, myths, how, did, everything, begin, this, is, the, first, question, faced, by, any, creation, myth, and, answering, it, remains, tricky, each, beginning, seems, to, presuppose, an, earlier, beginning, instead, of, meeting, a, single, starting, point, we, encounter, an, infinity, of, them, each, of, which, poses, the, same, problem, there, are, no, entirely, satisfactory, solutions, to, this, dilemma, what, we, have, to, find, is, not, a, solution, but, some, way, of, dealing, with, the, mystery, and, we, have, to, do, so, using, words, the, words, we, reach, for, from, god, to, gravity, are, inadequate, to, the, task, so, we, have, to, use, language, poetically, or, symbolically, and, such, language, whether, used, by, a, scientist, a, poet, or, a, shaman, can, easily, be, misunderstood, mythologists, have, applied, various, schemes, to, classify, creation, myths, found, throughout, human, cultures, eliade, and, his, colleague, charles, long, developed, a, classification, based, on, some, common, motifs, that, reappear, in, stories, the, world, over, the, classification, identifies, five, basic, types, marta, weigle, further, developed, and, refined, this, typology, to, highlight, nine, themes, adding, elements, such, as, deus, faber, a, creation, crafted, by, a, deity, creation, from, the, work, of, two, creators, working, together, or, against, each, other, creation, from, sacrifice, and, creation, from, division, conjugation, accretion, conjunction, or, secretion, an, alternative, system, based, on, six, recurring, narrative, themes, was, designed, by, raymond, van, over, the, myth, that, god, created, the, world, out, of, nothing, ex, nihilo, is, central, today, to, judaism, christianity, and, islam, and, the, medieval, jewish, philosopher, maimonides, felt, it, was, the, only, concept, that, the, three, religions, shared, nonetheless, the, concept, is, not, found, in, the, entire, hebrew, bible, the, authors, of, genesis, 1, were, concerned, not, with, the, origins, of, matter, the, material, which, god, formed, into, the, habitable, cosmos, but, with, assigning, roles, so, that, the, cosmos, should, function, in, the, early, 2nd, century, ce, early, christian, scholars, were, beginning, to, see, a, tension, between, the, idea, of, world, formation, and, the, omnipotence, of, god, and, by, the, beginning, of, the, 3rd, century, creation, ex, nihilo, had, become, a, fundamental, tenet, of, christian, theology, ex, nihilo, creation, is, found, in, creation, stories, from, ancient, egypt, the, rig, veda, and, many, animistic, cultures, in, africa, asia, oceania, and, north, america, in, most, of, these, stories, the, world, is, brought, into, being, by, the, speech, dream, breath, or, pure, thought, of, a, creator, but, creation, ex, nihilo, may, also, take, place, through, a, creator, s, bodily, secretions, the, literal, translation, of, the, phrase, ex, nihilo, is, from, nothing, but, in, many, creation, myths, the, line, is, blurred, whether, the, creative, act, would, be, better, classified, as, a, creation, ex, nihilo, or, creation, from, chaos, in, ex, nihilo, creation, myths, the, potential, and, the, substance, of, creation, springs, from, within, the, creator, such, a, creator, may, or, may, not, be, existing, in, physical, surroundings, such, as, darkness, or, water, but, does, not, create, the, world, from, them, whereas, in, creation, from, chaos, the, substance, used, for, creation, is, pre, existing, within, the, unformed, void, in, creation, from, chaos, myths, there, is, nothing, initially, but, a, formless, shapeless, expanse, in, these, stories, the, word, chaos, means, disorder, and, this, formless, expanse, which, is, also, sometimes, called, a, void, or, an, abyss, contains, the, material, with, which, the, created, world, will, be, made, chaos, may, be, described, as, having, the, consistency, of, vapor, or, water, dimensionless, and, sometimes, salty, or, muddy, these, myths, associate, chaos, with, evil, and, oblivion, in, contrast, to, order, cosmos, which, is, the, good, the, act, of, creation, is, the, bringing, of, order, from, disorder, and, in, many, of, these, cultures, it, is, believed, that, at, some, point, the, forces, preserving, order, and, form, will, weaken, and, the, world, will, once, again, be, engulfed, into, the, abyss, one, example, is, the, genesis, creation, narrative, from, the, first, chapter, of, the, book, of, genesis, there, are, two, types, of, world, parent, myths, both, describing, a, separation, or, splitting, of, a, primeval, entity, the, world, parent, or, parents, one, form, describes, the, primeval, state, as, an, eternal, union, of, two, parents, and, the, creation, takes, place, when, the, two, are, pulled, apart, the, two, parents, are, commonly, identified, as, sky, usually, male, and, earth, usually, female, who, were, so, tightly, bound, to, each, other, in, the, primeval, state, that, no, offspring, could, emerge, these, myths, often, depict, creation, as, the, result, of, a, sexual, union, and, serve, as, genealogical, record, of, the, deities, born, from, it, in, the, second, form, of, world, parent, myths, creation, itself, springs, from, dismembered, parts, of, the, body, of, the, primeval, being, often, in, these, stories, the, limbs, hair, blood, bones, or, organs, of, the, primeval, being, are, somehow, severed, or, sacrificed, to, transform, into, sky, earth, animal, or, plant, life, and, other, worldly, features, these, myths, tend, to, emphasize, creative, forces, as, animistic, in, nature, rather, than, sexual, and, depict, the, sacred, as, the, elemental, and, integral, component, of, the, natural, world, one, example, of, this, is, the, norse, creation, myth, described, in, v, lusp, the, first, poem, in, the, poetic, edda, and, in, gylfaginning, in, emergence, myths, humanity, emerges, from, another, world, into, the, one, they, currently, inhabit, the, previous, world, is, often, considered, the, womb, of, the, earth, mother, and, the, process, of, emergence, is, likened, to, the, act, of, giving, birth, the, role, of, midwife, is, usually, played, by, a, female, deity, like, the, spider, woman, of, several, mythologies, of, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, male, characters, rarely, figure, into, these, stories, and, scholars, often, consider, them, in, counterpoint, to, male, oriented, creation, myths, like, those, of, the, ex, nihilo, variety, emergence, myths, commonly, describe, the, creation, of, people, and, or, supernatural, beings, as, a, staged, ascent, or, metamorphosis, from, nascent, forms, through, a, series, of, subterranean, worlds, to, arrive, at, their, current, place, and, form, often, the, passage, from, one, world, or, stage, to, the, next, is, impelled, by, inner, forces, a, process, of, germination, or, gestation, from, earlier, embryonic, forms, the, genre, is, most, commonly, found, in, native, american, cultures, where, the, myths, frequently, link, the, final, emergence, of, people, from, a, hole, opening, to, the, underworld, to, stories, about, their, subsequent, migrations, and, eventual, settlement, in, their, current, homelands, the, earth, diver, is, a, common, character, in, various, traditional, creation, myths, in, these, stories, a, supreme, being, usually, sends, an, animal, most, often, a, type, of, bird, but, also, crustaceans, insects, and, fish, in, some, narratives, into, the, primal, waters, to, find, bits, of, sand, or, mud, with, which, to, build, habitable, land, some, scholars, interpret, these, myths, psychologically, while, others, interpret, them, cosmogonically, in, both, cases, emphasis, is, placed, on, beginnings, emanating, from, the, depths, according, to, gudmund, hatt, and, tristram, p, coffin, earth, diver, myths, are, common, in, native, american, folklore, among, the, following, populations, shoshone, meskwaki, blackfoot, chipewyan, newettee, yokuts, of, california, mandan, hidatsa, cheyenne, arapaho, ojibwe, yuchi, and, cherokee, american, anthropologist, gladys, reichard, located, the, distribution, of, the, motif, across, all, parts, of, north, america, save, for, the, extreme, north, northeast, and, southwest, in, a, 1977, study, anthropologist, victor, barnouw, surmised, that, the, earth, diver, motif, appeared, in, hunting, gathering, societies, mainly, among, northerly, groups, such, as, the, hare, dogrib, kaska, beaver, carrier, chipewyan, sarsi, cree, and, montagnais, similar, tales, are, also, found, among, the, chukchi, and, yukaghir, the, tatars, and, many, finno, ugric, traditions, as, well, as, among, the, buryat, and, the, samoyed, in, addition, the, earth, diver, motif, also, exists, in, narratives, from, eastern, europe, namely, romani, romanian, slavic, namely, bulgarian, polish, ukrainian, and, belarusian, and, lithuanian, mythological, traditions, the, pattern, of, distribution, of, these, stories, suggest, they, have, a, common, origin, in, the, eastern, asiatic, coastal, region, spreading, as, peoples, migrated, west, into, siberia, and, east, to, the, north, american, continent, however, there, are, examples, of, this, mytheme, found, well, outside, of, this, boreal, distribution, pattern, for, example, the, west, african, yoruba, creation, myth, of, batala, and, oduduwa, characteristic, of, many, native, american, myths, earth, diver, creation, stories, begin, as, beings, and, potential, forms, linger, asleep, or, suspended, in, the, primordial, realm, the, earth, diver, is, among, the, first, of, them, to, awaken, and, lay, the, necessary, groundwork, by, building, suitable, lands, where, the, coming, creation, will, be, able, to, live, in, many, cases, these, stories, will, describe, a, series, of, failed, attempts, to, make, land, before, the, solution, is, found, among, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, earth, diver, cosmogony, is, attested, in, iroquois, mythology, a, female, sky, deity, falls, from, the, heavens, and, certain, animals, the, beaver, the, otter, the, duck, and, the, muskrat, dive, in, the, waters, to, fetch, mud, to, construct, an, island, in, a, similar, story, from, the, seneca, people, lived, in, a, sky, realm, one, day, the, chief, s, daughter, was, afflicted, with, a, mysterious, illness, and, the, only, cure, recommended, for, her, revealed, in, a, dream, was, to, lie, beside, a, tree, and, to, have, it, be, dug, up, the, people, do, so, but, a, man, complains, that, the, tree, was, their, livelihood, and, kicks, the, girl, through, the, hole, she, ends, up, falling, from, the, sky, to, a, world, of, only, water, but, is, rescued, by, waterfowl, a, turtle, offers, to, bear, her, on, its, shell, but, asked, where, would, be, a, definitive, dwelling, place, for, her, they, decide, to, create, land, and, the, toad, dives, into, the, depths, of, the, primal, sea, to, get, pieces, of, soil, the, toad, puts, it, on, the, turtle, s, back, which, grows, larger, with, every, deposit, of, soil, in, another, version, from, the, wyandot, the, wyandot, lived, in, heaven, the, daughter, of, the, big, chief, or, mighty, ruler, was, sick, so, the, medicine, man, recommends, that, they, dig, up, the, wild, apple, tree, that, stands, next, to, the, lodge, of, the, mighty, ruler, because, the, remedy, is, to, be, found, on, its, roots, however, as, the, tree, has, been, dug, out, the, ground, begins, to, sink, away, and, the, treetops, catch, and, carry, down, the, sick, daughter, with, it, as, the, girl, falls, from, the, skies, two, swans, rescue, her, on, their, backs, the, birds, decide, to, summon, all, the, swimmers, and, the, water, tribes, many, volunteer, to, dive, into, the, great, water, to, fetch, bits, of, earth, from, the, bottom, of, the, sea, but, only, the, toad, female, in, the, story, is, the, one, successful
