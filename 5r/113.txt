given, wide, currency, by, irenaeus, in, his, 2nd, century, tract, contra, haereses, against, heresies, to, describe, and, discredit, his, opponents, during, the, early, centuries, of, the, christian, community, he, described, the, community, s, beliefs, and, doctrines, as, orthodox, from, orthos, straight, or, correct, and, doxa, belief, and, the, gnostics, teachings, as, heretical, he, also, invoked, the, concept, of, apostolic, succession, to, support, his, arguments, constantine, the, great, who, along, with, licinius, had, decreed, toleration, of, christianity, in, the, roman, empire,

church, had, no, state, sponsored, support, for, any, particular, legal, mechanism, to, counter, what, it, perceived, as, heresy, by, this, edict, the, state, s, authority, and, that, of, the, church, became, somewhat, overlapping, one, of, the, outcomes, of, this, blurring, of, church, and, state, was, the, sharing, of, state, powers, of, legal, enforcement, with, church, authorities, within, six,

heresy, but, believed, capital, punishment, to, be, inappropriate, at, best, and, usually, unequivocally, evil, the, edict, of, theodosius, ii, 435, provided, severe, punishments, for, those, who,

the, great, and, enduring, heresy, of, mohammed, for, some, years, after, the, reformation, protestant, churches, were, also, known, to, execute, those, they, considered, heretics, for, example, michael, servetus, was, declared, a, heretic, by, both, the, reformed, church, and, catholic, church, for, rejecting, the, christian, doctrine, of, the, holy, trinity, the, last, known, heretic,

ecclesiastical, authorities, is, not, known, although, less, common, than, in, earlier, periods, in, modern, times, formal, charges, of, heresy, within, christian, churches, still, occur, issues, in, the, protestant, churches, have, included, modern, biblical, criticism, and, the, nature, of, god, in, the, catholic, church, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, criticizes, writings, for, ambiguities, and, errors, without, using, the, word, heresy, on, 11, july, 2007, pope, benedict, xvi, stated, that, some, protestant, groups, are, ecclesial, communities, rather, than, churches, representatives, of, some, of, these, christian, denominations, accused, the, vatican, of, effectively, calling, them, heretics, however, pope, benedict, xvi, clarified, that, the, phrase, ecclesial, community, did, not, necessitate, explicit, heresy, but, only, that, the, communities, lacked, certain, essential, elements, of, an, apostolic, church, as, he, had, written, in, the,

harshly, with, strands, of, christianity, that, it, considered, heretical, but, before, the, 11th, century, these, tended, to, centre, on, individual, preachers, or, small, localised, sects, like, arianism, pelagianism, donatism, marcionism, and, montanism, the, diffusion, of, the, almost, manichaean, sect, of, paulicians, westwards, gave, birth, to, the, famous, 11th, and, 12th, century, heresies, of, western, europe, the, first, one, was, that, of, bogomils, in, modern, day, bulgaria, a, sort, of, sanctuary, between, eastern, and, western, christianity, by, the, 11th, century, more, organised, groups, such, as, the, patarini, the, dulcinians, the, waldensians, and, the, cathars, were, beginning, to, appear, in, the, towns, and, cities, of, northern, italy, southern, france, and, flanders, in, france, the, cathars, grew, to, represent, a, popular, mass, movement, and, the, belief, was, spreading, to, other, areas, the, cathar, crusade, was, initiated, by, the, catholic, church, to, eliminate, the, cathar, heresy, in, languedoc, heresy, was, a, major, justification, for, the, inquisition, inquisitio, haereticae, pravitatis, inquiry, on, heretical, perversity, and,

sentenced, to, house, arrest, under, which, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, galileo, was, found, vehemently, suspect, of, heresy, namely, of, having, held, the, opinions, that, the, sun, lies, motionless, at, the, centre, of, the, universe, and, that, the, earth, is, not, at, its, centre, and, moves, and, that, one, may, hold, and, defend, an, opinion, as, probable, after, it, has, been, declared, contrary, to, holy, scripture, he, was, required, to, abjure, curse, and, detest, those, opinions, most, contemporary, historians, of, science, believe, the, galileo, affair, is, an, exception, in, the, overall, relationship, between, science, and, christianity, pope, gregory, i, stigmatized, judaism, and, the, jewish, people, in, many, of, his, writings, he, described, jews, as, enemies, of, christ, the, more, the, holy, spirit, fills, the, world, the, more, perverse, hatred, dominates, the, souls, of, the, jews, he, labeled, all, heresy, as, jewish, claiming, that, judaism, would, pollute, deceive, them, with, sacrilegious, seduction, the, identification, of, jews, and, heretics, in, particular, occurred, several, times, in, roman, christian, law, in, eastern, orthodox, christianity, heresy, most, commonly, refers, to, those, beliefs, declared, heretical, by, the, first, seven, ecumenical, councils, since, the, great, schism, and, the, protestant, reformation, various, christian, churches, have, also, used, the, concept, in, proceedings, against, individuals, and, groups, those, churches, deemed, heretical, the, eastern, orthodox, church, also, rejects, the, early, christian, heresies, such, as, arianism, gnosticism, origenism, montanism, judaizers, marcionism, docetism, adoptionism, nestorianism, monophysitism, monothelitism, and, iconoclasm,

lutheranism, lists, 10, heresies, by, name, which, are, condemned, manichaeans, valentinians, arians, eunomians, mohammedans, samosatenes, pelagians, anabaptists, donatists, and, certain, jewish, opinions, the, 39, articles, of, the, anglican, communion, condemn, pelagianism, as, a, heresy, in, britain, the, 16th, century, english, reformation, resulted, in, a, number, of, executions, on, charges, of, heresy, during, the, thirty, eight, years, of, henry, viii, s, reign, about, sixty, heretics, mainly, protestants, were, executed, and, a, rather, greater, number, of, catholics, lost, their, lives, on, grounds, of, political, offences, such, as, treason, notably, sir, thomas, more, and, cardinal, john, fisher, for, refusing, to, accept, the, king, s, supremacy, over, the, church, in, england, under, edward, vi, the, heresy, laws, were, repealed, in, 1547, only, to, be, reintroduced, in, 1554, by, mary, i, even, so, two, radicals, were, executed, in, edward, s, reign, one, for, denying, the, reality, of, the, incarnation, the, other, for, denying, christ, s, divinity, under, mary, around, two, hundred, and, ninety, people, were, burned, at, the, stake, between, 1555, and, 1558, after, the, restoration, of, papal, jurisdiction, when, elizabeth, i, came, to, the, throne, the, concept, of, heresy, was, retained, in, theory, but, severely, restricted, by, the, 1559, act, of, supremacy, and, the, one, hundred, and, eighty, or, so, catholics, who, were, executed, in, the, forty, five, years, of, her, reign, were, put, to, death, because, they, were, considered, members, of, a, subversive, fifth, column, the, last, execution, of, a, heretic, in, england, occurred, under, james, vi, and, i, in, 1612, although, the, charge, was, technically, one, of, blasphemy, there, was, one, later, execution, in, scotland, still, at, that, date, an, entirely, independent, kingdom, when, in, 1697, thomas, aikenhead, was, accused, among, other, things, of, denying, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, another, example, of, the, persecution, of, heretics, under, protestant, rule, was, the, execution, of, the, boston, martyrs, in, 1659, 1660, and, 1661, these, executions, resulted, from, the, actions, of, the, anglican, puritans, who, at, that, time, wielded, political, as, well, as, ecclesiastic, control, in, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, at, the, time, the, colony, leaders, were, apparently, hoping, to, achieve, their, vision, of, a, purer, absolute, theocracy, within, their, colony, as, such, they, perceived, the, teachings, and, practices, of, the, rival, quaker, sect, as, heretical, even, to, the, point, where, laws, were, passed, and, executions, were, performed, with, the, aim, of, ridding, their, colony, of, such, perceived, heresies, the, articles, of, religion, of, the, methodist, churches, teach, that, pelagianism, is, a, heresy, john, wesley, the, founder, of, the, methodist, tradition, harshly, criticized, antinomianism, considering, it, the, worst, of, all, heresies, he, taught, that, christian, believers, are, bound, to, follow, the, moral, law, for, their, sanctification, methodist, christians, thus, teach, the, necessity, of,

considers, reform, and, reconstructionist, judaism, heretical, movements, and, regards, most, of, conservative, judaism, as, heretical, the, liberal, wing, of, modern, orthodoxy, is, more, tolerant,

in, a, form, different, from, that, originally, described, by, l, ron, hubbard, is, referred, to, within, scientology, as, squirreling, and, is, said, by, scientologists, to, be, high, treason, the, religious, technology, center, has, prosecuted, breakaway, groups, who, have, practiced, scientology, outside, the, official, church, without, authorization, although, zoroastrianism, has, had, an, historical, tolerance, for, other, religions, it, also, held, sects, like, zurvanism, and, mazdakism, heretical, to, its, main, dogma, and, has, violently, persecuted, them, such, as, burying, mazdakians, with, their, feet, upright, as, human, gardens, in, later, periods, zoroastrians, cooperated, with, muslims, to, kill, other, zoroastrians, deemed, heretical, buddhist, and, taoist, monks, in, medieval, china, often, called, each, other, heretics, and, competed, to, be, praised, by, the, royal, court, although, today, most, chinese, believe, in, a, hybrid, of, the, three, teachings, buddhism, taoism, confucian, the, competition, between, the, two, religions, may, still, be, seen, in, some, teachings, and, commentaries, given, by, both, religions, today, a, similar, situation, happened, with, shinto, in, japan, neo, confucian, heresy, has, also, been, described, in, other, contexts, the, term, does, not, necessarily, have, pejorative, overtones, and, may, even, be, complimentary, when, used, in, areas, where, innovation, is, welcome, of, ideas, that, are, in, fundamental, disagreement, with, the, status, quo, in, any, practice, and, branch, of, knowledge, scientist, author, isaac, asimov, considered, heresy, as, an, abstraction, mentioning, religious, political, socioeconomic, and, scientific, heresies, he, divided, scientific, heretics, into, endoheretics, those, from, within, the, scientific, community, and, exoheretics, those, from, without, characteristics, were, ascribed, to, both, and, examples, of, both, kinds, were, offered, asimov, concluded, that, science, orthodoxy, defends, itself, well, against, endoheretics, by, control, of, science, education, grants, and, publication, as, examples, but, is, nearly, powerless, against, exoheretics, he, acknowledged, by, examples, that, heresy, has, repeatedly, become, orthodoxy, publishing, his, findings, as, the, dinosaur, heresies, revisionist, paleontologist, robert, t, bakker, himself, a, scientific, endoheretic, treated, the, mainstream, view, of, dinosaurs, as, dogma, i, have, enormous, respect, for, dinosaur, paleontologists, past, and, present, but, on, average, for, the, last, fifty, years, the, field, hasn, t, tested, dinosaur, orthodoxy, severely, enough, 27, he, adds, that, most, taxonomists, however, have, viewed, such, new, terminology, as, dangerously, destabilizing, to, the, traditional, and, well, known, scheme, 462, the, illustrations, by, the, author, show, dinosaurs, in, very, active, poses, in, contrast, to, the, traditional, perception, of, lethargy, immanuel, velikovsky, is, an, example, of, a, recent, scientific, exoheretic, he, did, not, have, appropriate, scientific, credentials, and, did, not, publish, in, scientific, journals, while, the, details, of, his, work, are, in, scientific, disrepute, the, concept, of, catastrophic, change, extinction, event, and, punctuated, equilibrium, has, gained, acceptance, in, recent, decades, the, term, heresy, is, used, not, only, with, regard, to, religion, but, also, in, the, context, of, political, theory, the, term, heresy, is, also, used, as, an, ideological, pigeonhole, for, contemporary, writers, because, by, definition, heresy, depends, on, contrasts, with, an, established, orthodoxy, for, example, the, tongue, in, cheek, contemporary, usage, of, heresy, such, as, to, categorize, a, wall, street, heresy, a, democratic, heresy, or, a, republican, heresy, are, metaphors, that, invariably, retain, a, subtext, that, links, orthodoxies, in, geology, or, biology, or, any, other, field, to, religion, these, expanded, metaphoric, senses, allude, to, both, the, difference, between, the, person, s, views, and, the, mainstream, and, the, boldness, of, such, a, person, in, propounding, these, views
