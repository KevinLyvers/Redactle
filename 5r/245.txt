there, is, no, class, distinction, among, them, amid, the, hajj, every, single, muslim, man, dresses, alike, in, a, straightforward, fabric, again, to, emphasize, their, uniformity, ladies, wear, a, less, complex, type, of, their, ordinary, dress, pilgrims, put, the, white, sheets, on, when, they, enter, the, sanctuary, area, of, mecca, and, enter, a, state, of, ihram, or, purity, after, a,

stone, pillars, that, represent, satan, as, to, express, their, hatred, for, shaitan, satan, they, then, return, to, mecca, for, final, ceremonies, by, circumambulating, the, ka, aba, seven, times, and, then, leave, mecca, to, journey, back, home, inability, to, make, the, hajj, whether, because, of, physical, strength, economic, conditions, or, other, reasons, excuses, the, duty, of, hajj, the, quran, specifically, says, that, only, those, capable, of, making, the, pilgrimage, are, required, to, do, so, the, reason, for, this, journey, is, to, follow, in, the, footsteps, of, muhammad, hoping, to, gain, enlightenment, as, muhammad, did, when, he, was, in, the, presence, of, god, the, pilgrimage, of, the, hajj, is, in, the, quran, the, pilgrim, or, the, haji, is, honoured, in, the, muslim, community, islamic, teachers, say, that, the, hajj, should, be, an, expression, of, devotion, to, god, not, a, means, to, gain, social, standing, the, believer, should, be, self, aware, and, examine, their, intentions, in, performing, the, pilgrimage, this, should, lead, to, constant, striving, for, self, improvement, a, pilgrimage, made, at, any, time, other, than, the, hajj, season, is, called, an, umrah, and, while, not, mandatory, is, strongly, recommended, twelver, shia, islam, has, five, usul, al, din, and, ten, furu, al, din, i, e, the, shia, islamic, beliefs, and, practices, the, twelver, shia, islam, usul, al, din, equivalent, to, a, shia, five, pillars, are, all, beliefs, considered, foundational, to, islam, and, thus, classified, a, bit, differently, from, those, listed, above, they, are, in, addition, to, these, five, pillars, there, are, ten, practices, that, shia, muslims, must, perform, called, the, ancillaries, of, the, faith, arabic, fur, al, d, n, isma, ilis, have, their, own, pillars, which, are, as, follows, one, of, the, greatest, assumptions, about, islamic, history, is, that, the, five, pillars, were, already, set, and, in, place, at, the, time, of, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, ce, however, most, changes, to, these, islamic, rituals, came, from, small, differences, among, minority, muslim, groups, the, major, beliefs, of, the, pillars, were, already, in, place, taking, the, shape, of, the, life, and, beliefs, of, muhammad, the, five, pillars, are, alluded, to, in, the, quran, and, some, are, even, specifically, stated, in, the, quran, like, the, hajj, to, mecca, however, the, difference, in, practice, of, these, traditions, are, accepted, in, islam, of, the, five, pillars, but, this, does, not, mean, they, have, all, existed, since, the, life, of, muhammad, the, evidence, of, differences, shows, pillars, have, not, always, been, consistent, to, what, they, are, today, so, it, has, taken, many, years, for, the, pillars, to, get, to, their, current, and, classic, form
