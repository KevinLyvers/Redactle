1st, chapter, of, the, platform, sutra, the, religious, biography, of, huineng, where, hearing, its, recitation, is, supposed, to, have, triggered, the, enlightening, insight, that, led, huineng, to, abandon, his, life, as, a, woodcutter, to, become, a, buddhist, monk, the, vajracchedik, praj, p, ramit, sutra, contains, the, discourse, of, the, buddha, to, a, senior, monk, subhuti, its, major, themes, are, anatman, not, self, the, emptiness, of, all, phenomena, though, the, term, nyat, itself, does, not, appear, in, the, text, the, liberation, of, all, beings, without, attachment, and, the, importance, of, spreading, and, teaching, the, diamond, s, tra, itself, in, his, commentary, on, the, diamond, s, tra, hsing, yun, describes, the, four, main, points, from, the, s, tra, as, giving, without, attachment, to, self, liberating, beings, without, notions, of, self, and, other, living, without, attachment, and, cultivating, without, attainment, according, to, shigenori, nagatomo, the, major, goal, of, the, diamond, s, tra, is, an, existential, project, aiming, at, achieving, and, embodying, a, non, discriminatory, basis, for, knowledge, or, the, emancipation, from, the, fundamental, ignorance, of, not, knowing, how, to, experience, reality, as, it, is, in, the, s, tra, the, buddha, has, finished, his, daily, walk, to, sravasti, with, the, monks, to, gather, offerings, of, food, and, he, sits, down, to, rest, elder, subh, ti, comes, forth, and, asks, the, buddha, how, lord, should, one, who, has, set, out, on, the, bodhisattva, path, take, his, stand, how, should, he, proceed, how, should, he, control, the, mind, what, follows, is, a, dialogue, regarding, the, nature, of, the, perfection, of, insight, praj, p, ramit, and, the, nature, of, ultimate, reality, which, is, illusory, and, empty, the, buddha, begins, by, answering, subhuti, by, stating, that, he, will, bring, all, living, beings, to, final, nirvana, but, that, after, this, no, living, being, whatsoever, has, been, brought, to, extinction, this, is, because, a, bodhisattva, does, not, see, beings, through, reified, concepts, such, as, person, soul, or, self, but, sees, them, through, the, lens, of, perfect, understanding, as, empty, of, inherent, unchanging, self, the, buddha, continues, his, exposition, with, similar, statements, which, use, negation, to, point, out, the, emptiness, of, phenomena, merit, the, dharma, buddha, s, teaching, the, stages, of, enlightenment, and, the, buddha, himself, japanese, buddhologist, hajime, nakamura, calls, this, negation, the, logic, of, not, na, prthak, further, examples, of, the, diamond, s, tra, s, via, negativa, include, statements, such, as, the, buddha, is, generally, thought, to, be, trying, to, help, subh, ti, unlearn, his, preconceived, limited, notions, of, the, nature, of, reality, emphasizing, that, all, phenomena, are, ultimately, illusory, he, teaches, that, true, enlightenment, cannot, be, grasped, until, one, has, set, aside, attachment, to, them, in, any, form, another, reason, why, the, buddha, makes, use, of, negation, is, that, language, reifies, concepts, and, this, can, lead, to, attachment, to, those, concepts, but, true, wisdom, is, seeing, that, nothing, is, fixed, or, stable, hence, according, to, the, diamond, s, tra, thoughts, such, as, i, have, obtained, the, state, of, an, arhat, or, i, will, bring, living, beings, to, nirvana, do, not, even, occur, in, an, enlightened, one, s, mind, because, this, would, be, seizing, upon, a, self, seizing, upon, a, living, being, seizing, upon, a, soul, seizing, upon, a, person, the, sutra, goes, on, to, state, that, anyone, who, says, such, things, should, not, be, called, a, bodhisattva, according, to, david, kalupahana, the, goal, of, the, diamond, s, tra, is, one, colossal, attempt, to, avoid, the, extremist, use, of, language, that, is, to, eliminate, any, ontological, commitment, to, concepts, while, at, the, same, time, retaining, their, pragmatic, value, so, as, not, to, render, them, totally, empty, of, meaning, kalupahana, explains, the, negation, of, the, diamond, s, tra, by, seeing, an, initial, statement, as, an, erroneous, affirmation, of, substance, or, selfhood, which, is, then, critiqued, all, dharmas, are, dharmaless, and, then, finally, reconstructed, that, is, why, they, are, called, all, dharmas, as, being, conventional, and, dependently, originated, kalupahana, explains, this, final, reconstruction, as, meaning, that, each, concept, instead, of, either, representing, a, unique, entity, or, being, an, empty, term, is, a, substitute, for, a, human, experience, which, is, conditioned, by, a, variety, of, factors, as, such, it, has, pragmatic, meaning, and, communicative, power, without, being, absolute, in, any, way, according, to, paul, harrison, the, diamond, s, tra, s, central, argument, here, is, that, all, dharmas, lack, a, self, or, essence, or, to, put, it, in, other, words, they, have, no, core, ontologically, they, only, appear, to, exist, separately, and, independently, by, the, power, of, conventional, language, even, though, they, are, in, fact, dependently, originated, the, mind, of, someone, who, practices, the, praj, p, ramit, or, perfection, of, wisdom, is, then, a, mind, free, from, fixed, substantialist, or, self, concepts, however, lord, the, idea, of, a, self, will, not, occur, to, them, nor, will, the, idea, of, a, living, being, the, idea, of, a, soul, or, the, idea, of, a, person, occur, why, is, that, any, such, idea, of, a, self, is, indeed, idealess, any, idea, of, a, living, being, idea, of, a, soul, or, idea, of, a, person, is, indeed, idealess, why, is, that, because, the, buddhas, and, lords, are, free, of, all, ideas, throughout, the, teaching, the, buddha, repeats, that, successful, memorization, and, elucidation, of, even, a, four, line, extract, of, it, is, of, incalculable, merit, better, than, giving, an, entire, world, system, filled, with, gifts, and, can, bring, about, enlightenment, section, 32, of, the, chinese, version, also, ends, with, a, four, line, gatha, all, conditioned, phenomena, are, like, a, dream, an, illusion, a, bubble, a, shadow, like, dew, or, a, flash, of, lightning, thus, we, shall, perceive, them, paul, harrison, s, translation, of, the, sanskrit, version, states, a, shooting, star, a, clouding, of, the, sight, a, lamp, an, illusion, a, drop, of, dew, a, bubble, a, dream, a, lightning, s, flash, a, thunder, cloud, this, is, the, way, one, should, see, the, conditioned, red, pine, s, translation, about, life, showed, that, the, text, read, so, you, should, view, this, fleeting, world, a, star, at, dawn, a, bubble, in, a, stream, a, flash, of, lightning, in, a, summer, cloud, a, flickering, lamp, a, phantom, and, a, dream, there, is, a, woodblock, printed, copy, of, the, diamond, sutra, in, the, british, library, which, although, not, the, earliest, example, of, block, printing, is, the, earliest, example, which, bears, an, actual, date, the, extant, copy, is, in, the, form, of, a, scroll, about, five, metres, 16, ft, long, the, archaeologist, sir, marc, aurel, stein, purchased, it, in, 1907, in, the, walled, up, mogao, caves, near, dunhuang, in, northwest, china, from, a, monk, guarding, the, caves, known, as, the, caves, of, the, thousand, buddhas, the, colophon, at, the, inner, end, reads, reverently, made, for, universal, free, distribution, by, wang, jie, on, behalf, of, his, two, parents, on, the, 15th, day, of, the, 4th,
