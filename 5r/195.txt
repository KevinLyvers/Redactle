the, torah, t, r, t, o, r, biblical, hebrew, t, r, instruction, teaching, or, law, is, the, compilation, of, the, first, five, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, namely, the, books, of, genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, and, deuteronomy, the, torah, is, known, as, the, pentateuch, p, n, t, tj, u, k, or, the, five, books, of, moses, by, christians, it, is, also, known, as, the, written, torah, t, r, ebb, v, in, rabbinical, jewish, tradition, if, meant, for, liturgic, purposes, it, takes, the, form, of, a, torah, scroll, hebrew, sefer, torah, if, in, bound, book, form, it, is, called, chumash, and, is, usually, printed, with, the, rabbinic, commentaries, perushim, in, rabbinic, literature, the, word, torah, denotes, both, the, five, books, torah, that, is, written, and, the, oral, torah, torah, that, is, spoken, it, has, also, been, used, however, to, designate, the, entire, hebrew, bible, the, oral, torah, consists, of, interpretations, and, amplifications, which, according, to, rabbinic, tradition, have, been, handed, down, from, generation, to, generation, and, are, now, embodied, in, the, talmud, and, midrash, rabbinic, tradition, s, understanding, is, that, all, of, the, teachings, found, in, the, torah, both, written, and, oral, were, given, by, god, through, the, prophet, moses, some, at, mount, sinai, and, others, at, the, tabernacle, and, all, the, teachings, were, written, down, by, moses, which, resulted, in, the, torah, that, exists, today, according, to, the, midrash, the, torah, was, created, prior, to, the, creation, of, the, world, and, was, used, as, the, blueprint, for, creation, though, hotly, debated, the, general, trend, in, biblical, scholarship, is, to, recognize, the, final, form, of, the, torah, as, a, literary, and, ideological, unity, based, on, earlier, sources, largely, complete, by, the, persian, period, with, possibly, some, later, additions, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, words, of, the, torah, are, written, on, a, scroll, by, a, scribe, sofer, in, hebrew, a, torah, portion, is, read, every, monday, morning, and, thursday, morning, at, a, shul, synagogue, but, only, if, there, are, ten, males, above, the, age, of, thirteen, reading, the, torah, publicly, is, one, of, the, bases, of, jewish, communal, life, the, torah, is, also, considered, a, sacred, book, outside, judaism, in, samaritanism, the, samaritan, pentateuch, is, a, text, of, the, torah, written, in, the, samaritan, script, and, used, as, sacred, scripture, by, the, samaritans, the, torah, is, also, common, among, all, the, different, versions, of, the, christian, old, testament, in, islam, the, tawrat, arabic, is, the, arabic, name, for, the, torah, within, its, context, as, an, islamic, holy, book, believed, by, muslims, to, have, been, given, by, god, to, the, prophets, and, messengers, amongst, the, children, of, israel, the, word, torah, in, hebrew, is, derived, from, the, root, which, in, the, hif, il, conjugation, means, to, guide, or, to, teach, the, meaning, of, the, word, is, therefore, teaching, doctrine, or, instruction, the, commonly, accepted, law, gives, a, wrong, impression, the, alexandrian, jews, who, translated, the, septuagint, used, the, greek, word, nomos, meaning, norm, standard, doctrine, and, later, law, greek, and, latin, bibles, then, began, the, custom, of, calling, the, pentateuch, five, books, of, moses, the, law, other, translational, contexts, in, the, english, language, include, custom, theory, guidance, or, system, the, term, torah, is, used, in, the, general, sense, to, include, both, rabbinic, judaism, s, written, and, oral, law, serving, to, encompass, the, entire, spectrum, of, authoritative, jewish, religious, teachings, throughout, history, including, the, oral, torah, which, comprises, the, mishnah, the, talmud, the, midrash, and, more, the, inaccurate, rendering, of, torah, as, law, may, be, an, obstacle, to, understanding, the, ideal, that, is, summed, up, in, the, term, talmud, torah, study, of, torah, the, term, torah, is, also, used, to, designate, the, entire, hebrew, bible, the, earliest, name, for, the, first, part, of, the, bible, seems, to, have, been, the, torah, of, moses, this, title, however, is, found, neither, in, the, torah, itself, nor, in, the, works, of, the, pre, exilic, literary, prophets, it, appears, in, joshua, and, kings, but, it, cannot, be, said, to, refer, there, to, the, entire, corpus, according, to, academic, bible, criticism, in, contrast, there, is, every, likelihood, that, its, use, in, the, post, exilic, works, was, intended, to, be, comprehensive, other, early, titles, were, the, book, of, moses, and, the, book, of, the, torah, which, seems, to, be, a, contraction, of, a, fuller, name, the, book, of, the, torah, of, god, christian, scholars, usually, refer, to, the, first, five, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, as, the, pentateuch, p, n, t, t, ju, k, pen, t, tewk, greek, pent, teukhos, five, scrolls, a, term, first, used, in, the, hellenistic, judaism, of, alexandria, the, tawrat, also, tawrah, or, taurat, arabic, is, the, arabic, name, for, the, torah, which, muslims, believe, is, an, islamic, holy, book, given, by, god, to, the, prophets, and, messengers, amongst, the, children, of, israel, the, torah, starts, with, god, creating, the, world, then, describes, the, beginnings, of, the, people, of, israel, their, descent, into, egypt, and, the, giving, of, the, torah, at, mount, sinai, it, ends, with, the, death, of, moses, just, before, the, people, of, israel, cross, to, the, promised, land, of, canaan, interspersed, in, the, narrative, are, the, specific, teachings, religious, obligations, and, civil, laws, given, explicitly, i, e, ten, commandments, or, implicitly, embedded, in, the, narrative, as, in, exodus, 12, and, 13, laws, of, the, celebration, of, passover, in, hebrew, the, five, books, of, the, torah, are, identified, by, the, incipits, in, each, book, and, the, common, english, names, for, the, books, are, derived, from, the, greek, septuagint, and, reflect, the, essential, theme, of, each, book, the, book, of, genesis, is, the, first, book, of, the, torah, it, is, divisible, into, two, parts, the, primeval, history, chapters, 1, 11, and, the, ancestral, history, chapters, 12, 50, the, primeval, history, sets, out, the, author, s, or, authors, concepts, of, the, nature, of, the, deity, and, of, humankind, s, relationship, with, its, maker, god, creates, a, world, which, is, good, and, fit, for, mankind, but, when, man, corrupts, it, with, sin, god, decides, to, destroy, his, creation, using, the, flood, saving, only, the, righteous, noah, and, his, immediate, family, to, reestablish, the, relationship, between, man, and, god, the, ancestral, history, chapters, 12, 50, tells, of, the, prehistory, of, israel, god, s, chosen, people, at, god, s, command, noah, s, descendant, abraham, journeys, from, his, home, into, the, god, given, land, of, canaan, where, he, dwells, as, a, sojourner, as, does, his, son, isaac, and, his, grandson, jacob, jacob, s, name, is, changed, to, israel, and, through, the, agency, of, his, son, joseph, the, children, of, israel, descend, into, egypt, 70, people, in, all, with, their, households, and, god, promises, them, a, future, of, greatness, genesis, ends, with, israel, in, egypt, ready, for, the, coming, of, moses, and, the, exodus, the, narrative, is, punctuated, by, a, series, of, covenants, with, god, successively, narrowing, in, scope, from, all, mankind, the, covenant, with, noah, to, a, special, relationship, with, one, people, alone, abraham, and, his, descendants, through, isaac, and, jacob, the, book, of, exodus, is, the, second, book, of, the, torah, immediately, following, genesis, the, book, tells, how, the, ancient, israelites, leave, slavery, in, egypt, through, the, strength, of, yahweh, the, god, who, has, chosen, israel, as, his, people, yahweh, inflicts, horrific, harm, on, their, captors, via, the, legendary, plagues, of, egypt, with, the, prophet, moses, as, their, leader, they, journey, through, the, wilderness, to, mount, sinai, where, yahweh, promises, them, the, land, of, canaan, the, promised, land, in, return, for, their, faithfulness, israel, enters, into, a, covenant, with, yahweh, who, gives, them, their, laws, and, instructions, to, build, the, tabernacle, the, means, by, which, he, will, come, from, heaven, and, dwell, with, them, and, lead, them, in, a, holy, war, to, possess, the, land, and, then, give, them, peace, traditionally, ascribed, to, moses, himself, modern, scholarship, sees, the, book, as, initially, a, product, of, the, babylonian, exile, 6th, century, bce, from, earlier, written, and, oral, traditions, with, final, revisions, in, the, persian, post, exilic, period, 5th, century, bce, carol, meyers, in, her, commentary, on, exodus, suggests, that, it, is, arguably, the, most, important, book, in, the, bible, as, it, presents, the, defining, features, of, israel, s, identity, memories, of, a, past, marked, by, hardship, and, escape, a, binding, covenant, with, god, who, chooses, israel, and, the, establishment, of, the, life, of, the, community, and, the, guidelines, for, sustaining, it, the, book, of, leviticus, begins, with, instructions, to, the, israelites, on, how, to, use, the, tabernacle, which, they, had, just, built, leviticus, 1, 10, this, is, followed, by, rules, of, clean, and, unclean, leviticus, 11, 15, which, includes, the, laws, of, slaughter, and, animals, permissible, to, eat, see, also, kashrut, the, day, of, atonement, leviticus, 16, and, various, moral, and, ritual, laws, sometimes, called, the, holiness, code, leviticus, 17, 26, leviticus, 26, provides, a, detailed, list, of, rewards, for, following, god, s, commandments, and, a, detailed, list, of, punishments, for, not, following, them, leviticus, 17, establishes, sacrifices, at, the, tabernacle, as, an, everlasting, ordinance, but, this, ordinance, is, altered, in, later, books, with, the, temple, being, the, only, place, in, which, sacrifices, are, allowed, the, book, of, numbers, is, the, fourth, book, of, the, torah, the, book, has, a, long, and, complex, history, but, its, final, form, is, probably, due, to, a, priestly, redaction, i, e, editing, of, a, yahwistic, source, made, some, time, in, the, early, persian, period, 5th, century, bce, the, name, of, the, book, comes, from, the, two, censuses, taken, of, the, israelites, numbers, begins, at, mount, sinai, where, the, israelites, have, received, their, laws, and, covenant, from, god, and, god, has, taken, up, residence, among, them, in, the, sanctuary, the, task, before, them, is, to, take, possession, of, the, promised, land, the, people, are, counted, and, preparations, are, made, for, resuming, their, march, the, israelites, begin, the, journey, but, they, murmur, at, the, hardships, along, the, way, and, about, the, authority, of, moses, and, aaron, for, these, acts, god, destroys, approximately, 15, 000, of, them, through, various, means, they, arrive, at, the, borders, of, canaan, and, send, spies, into, the, land, upon, hearing, the, spies, fearful, report, concerning, the, conditions, in, canaan, the, israelites, refuse, to, take, possession, of, it, god, condemns, them, to, death, in, the, wilderness, until, a, new, generation, can, grow, up, and, carry, out, the, task, the, book, ends, with, the, new, generation, of, israelites, in, the, plains, of, moab, ready, for, the, crossing, of, the, jordan, river, numbers, is, the, culmination, of, the, story, of, israel, s, exodus, from, oppression, in, egypt, and, their, journey, to, take, possession, of, the, land, god, promised, their, fathers, as, such, it, draws, to, a, conclusion, the, themes, introduced, in, genesis, and, played, out, in, exodus, and, leviticus, god, has, promised, the, israelites, that, they, shall, become, a, great, i, e, numerous, nation, that, they, will, have, a, special, relationship, with, yahweh, their, god, and, that, they, shall, take, possession, of, the, land, of, canaan, numbers, also, demonstrates, the, importance, of, holiness, faithfulness, and, trust, despite, god, s, presence, and, his, priests, israel, lacks, faith, and, the, possession, of, the, land, is, left, to, a, new, generation, the, book, of, deuteronomy, is, the, fifth, book, of, the, torah, chapters, 1, 30, of, the, book, consist, of, three, sermons, or, speeches, delivered, to, the, israelites, by, moses, on, the, plains, of, moab, shortly, before, they, enter, the, promised, land, the, first, sermon, recounts, the, forty, years, of, wilderness, wanderings, which, had, led, to, that, moment, and, ends, with, an, exhortation, to, observe, the, law, or, teachings, later, referred, to, as, the, law, of, moses, the, second, reminds, the, israelites, of, the, need, to, follow, yahweh, and, the, laws, or, teachings, he, has, given, them, on, which, their, possession, of, the, land, depends, and, the, third, offers, the, comfort, that, even, should, israel, prove, unfaithful, and, so, lose, the, land, with, repentance, all, can, be, restored, the, final, four, chapters, 31, 34, contain, the, song, of, moses, the, blessing, of, moses, and, narratives, recounting, the, passing, of, the, mantle, of, leadership, from, moses, to, joshua, and, finally, the, death, of, moses, on, mount, nebo, presented, as, the, words, of, moses, delivered, before, the, conquest, of, canaan, a, broad, consensus, of, modern, scholars, see, its, origin, in, traditions, from, israel, the, northern, kingdom, brought, south, to, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, the, wake, of, the, assyrian, conquest, of, aram, 8th, century, bce, and, then, adapted, to, a, program, of, nationalist, reform, in, the, time, of, josiah, late, 7th, century, bce, with, the, final, form, of, the, modern, book, emerging, in, the, milieu, of, the, return, from, the, babylonian, captivity, during, the, late, 6th, century, bce, many, scholars, see, the, book, as, reflecting, the, economic, needs, and, social, status, of, the, levite, caste, who, are, believed, to, have, provided, its, authors, those, likely, authors, are, collectively, referred, to, as, the, deuteronomist, one, of, its, most, significant, verses, is, deuteronomy, 6, 4, the, shema, yisrael, which, has, become, the, definitive, statement, of, jewish, identity, hear, o, israel, the, l, ord, our, god, the, l, ord, is, one, verses, 6, 4, 5, were, also, quoted, by, jesus, in, mark, 12, 28, 34, as, part, of, the, great, commandment, the, talmud, states, that, the, torah, was, written, by, moses, with, the, exception, of, the, last, eight, verses, of, deuteronomy, describing, his, death, and, burial, being, written, by, joshua, according, to, the, mishnah, one, of, the, essential, tenets, of, judaism, is, that, god, transmitted, the, text, of, the, torah, to, moses, over, the, span, of, the, 40, years, the, israelites, were, in, the, desert, and, moses, was, like, a, scribe, who, was, dictated, to, and, wrote, down, all, of, the, events, the, stories, and, the, commandments, according, to, jewish, tradition, the, torah, was, recompiled, by, ezra, during, second, temple, period, the, talmud, says, that, ezra, changed, the, script, used, to, write, the, torah, from, the, older, hebrew, script, to, assyrian, script, so, called, according, to, the, talmud, because, they, brought, it, with, them, from, assyria, maharsha, says, that, ezra, made, no, changes, to, the, actual, text, of, the, torah, based, on, the, torah, s, prohibition, of, making, any, additions, or, deletions, to, the, torah, in, deuteronomy, 12, 32, by, contrast, the, modern, scholarly, consensus, rejects, mosaic, authorship, and, affirms, that, the, torah, has, multiple, authors, and, that, its, composition, took, place, over, centuries, the, precise, process, by, which, the, torah, was, composed, the, number, of, authors, involved, and, the, date, of, each, author, are, hotly, contested, throughout, most, of, the, 20th, century, there, was, a, scholarly, consensus, surrounding, the, documentary, hypothesis, which, posits, four, independent, sources, which, were, later, compiled, together, by, a, redactor, j, the, jahwist, source, e, the, elohist, source, p, the, priestly, source, and, d, the, deuteronomist, source, the, earliest, of, these, sources, j, would, have, been, composed, in, the, late, 7th, or, the, 6th, century, bce, with, the, latest, source, p, being, composed, around, the, 5th, century, bce, the, consensus, around, the, documentary, hypothesis, collapsed, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, groundwork, was, laid, with, the, investigation, of, the, origins, of, the, written, sources, in, oral, compositions, implying, that, the, creators, of, j, and, e, were, collectors, and, editors, and, not, authors, and, historians, rolf, rendtorff, building, on, this, insight, argued, that, the, basis, of, the, pentateuch, lay, in, short, independent, narratives, gradually, formed, into, larger, units, and, brought, together, in, two, editorial, phases, the, first, deuteronomic, the, second, priestly, by, contrast, john, van, seters, advocates, a, supplementary, hypothesis, which, posits, that, the, torah, was, derived, from, a, series, of, direct, additions, to, an, existing, corpus, of, work, a, neo, documentarian, hypothesis, which, responds, to, the, criticism, of, the, original, hypothesis, and, updates, the, methodology, used, to, determine, which, text, comes, from, which, sources, has, been, advocated, by, biblical, historian, joel, s, baden, among, others, such, a, hypothesis, continues, to, have, adherents, in, israel, and, north, america, the, majority, of, scholars, today, continue, to, recognize, deuteronomy, as, a, source, with, its, origin, in, the, law, code, produced, at, the, court, of, josiah, as, described, by, de, wette, subsequently, given, a, frame, during, the, exile, the, speeches, and, descriptions, at, the, front, and, back, of, the, code, to, identify, it, as, the, words, of, moses, however, since, the, 1990s, the, biblical, description, of, josiah, s, reforms, including, his, court, s, production, of, a, law, code, have, become, heavily, debated, among, academics, most, scholars, also, agree, that, some, form, of, priestly, source, existed, although, its, extent, especially, its, end, point, is, uncertain, the, remainder, is, called, collectively, non, priestly, a, grouping, which, includes, both, pre, priestly, and, post, priestly, material, the, final, torah, is, widely, seen, as, a, product, of, the, persian, period, 539, 332, bce, probably, 450, 350, bce, this, consensus, echoes, a, traditional, jewish, view, which, gives, ezra, the, leader, of, the, jewish, community, on, its, return, from, babylon, a, pivotal, role, in, its, promulgation, many, theories, have, been, advanced, to, explain, the, composition, of, the, torah, but, two, have, been, especially, influential, the, first, of, these, persian, imperial, authorisation, advanced, by, peter, frei, in, 1985, holds, that, the, persian, authorities, required, the, jews, of, jerusalem, to, present, a, single, body, of, law, as, the, price, of, local, autonomy, frei, s, theory, was, according, to, eskenazi, systematically, dismantled, at, an, interdisciplinary, symposium, held, in, 2000, but, the, relationship, between, the, persian, authorities, and, jerusalem, remains, a, crucial, question, the, second, theory, associated, with, joel, p, weinberg, and, called, the, citizen, temple, community, proposes, that, the, exodus, story, was, composed, to, serve, the, needs, of, a, post, exilic, jewish, community, organised, around, the, temple, which, acted, in, effect, as, a, bank, for, those, who, belonged, to, it, a, minority, of, scholars, would, place, the, final, formation, of, the, pentateuch, somewhat, later, in, the, hellenistic, 332, 164, bce, or, even, hasmonean, 140, 37, bce, periods, russell, gmirkin, for, instance, argues, for, a, hellenistic, dating, on, the, basis, that, the, elephantine, papyri, the, records, of, a, jewish, colony, in, egypt, dating, from, the, last, quarter, of, the, 5th, century, bce, make, no, reference, to, a, written, torah, the, exodus, or, to, any, other, biblical, event, though, it, does, mention, the, festival, of, passover, in, his, seminal, prolegomena, zur, geschichte, israels, julius, wellhausen, argued, that, judaism, as, a, religion, based, on, widespread, observance, of, the, torah, and, its, laws, first, emerged, in, 444, bce, when, according, to, the, biblical, account, provided, in, the, book, of, nehemiah, chapter, 8, a, priestly, scribe, named, ezra, read, a, copy, of, the, mosaic, torah, before, the, populace, of, judea, assembled, in, a, central, jerusalem, square, wellhausen, believed, that, this, narrative, should, be, accepted, as, historical, because, it, sounds, plausible, noting, the, credibility, of, the, narrative, appears, on, the, face, of, it, following, wellhausen, most, scholars, throughout, the, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, have, accepted, that, widespread, torah, observance, began, sometime, around, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, bce, more, recently, yonatan, adler, has, argued, that, in, fact, there, is, no, surviving, evidence, to, support, the, notion, that, the, torah, was, widely, known, regarded, as, authoritative, and, put, into, practice, prior, to, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, bce, adler, explored, the, likelihhood, that, judaism, as, the, widespread, practice, of, torah, law, by, jewish, society, at, large, first, emerged, in, judea, during, the, reign, of, the, hasmonean, dynasty, centuries, after, the, putative, time, of, ezra, by, contrast, john, j, collins, has, argued, that, the, observance, of, the, torah, started, in, persian, yehud, when, the, judeans, who, returned, from, exile, understood, its, normativity, as, the, observance, of, selected, ancestral, laws, of, high, symbolic, value, while, during, the, maccabean, revolt, jews, started, a, much, more, detailed, observance, of, its, precepts, rabbinic, writings, state, that, the, oral, torah, was, given, to, moses, at, mount, sinai, which, according, to, the, tradition, of, orthodox, judaism, occurred, in, 1312, bce, the, orthodox, rabbinic, tradition, holds, that, the, written, torah, was, recorded, during, the, following, forty, years, though, many, non, orthodox, jewish, scholars, affirm, the, modern, scholarly, consensus, that, the, written, torah, has, multiple, authors, and, was, written, over, centuries, all, classical, rabbinic, views, hold, that, the, torah, was, entirely, mosaic, and, of, divine, origin, present, day, reform, and, liberal, jewish, movements, all, reject, mosaic, authorship, as, do, most, shades, of, conservative, judaism, torah, reading, hebrew, k, riat, hatorah, reading, the, torah, is, a, jewish, religious, ritual, that, involves, the, public, reading, of, a, set, of, passages, from, a, torah, scroll, the, term, often, refers, to, the, entire, ceremony, of, removing, the, torah, scroll, or, scrolls, from, the, ark, chanting, the, appropriate, excerpt, with, traditional, cantillation, and, returning, the, scroll, s, to, the, ark, it, is, distinct, from, academic, torah, study, regular, public, reading, of, the, torah, was, introduced, by, ezra, the, scribe, after, the, return, of, the, jewish, people, from, the, babylonian, captivity, c, 537, bce, as, described, in, the, book, of, nehemiah, in, the, modern, era, adherents, of, orthodox, judaism, practice, torah, reading, according, to, a, set, procedure, they, believe, has, remained, unchanged, in, the, two, thousand, years, since, the, destruction, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, 70, ce, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, ce, new, movements, such, as, reform, judaism, and, conservative, judaism, have, made, adaptations, to, the, practice, of, torah, reading, but, the, basic, pattern, of, torah, reading, has, usually, remained, the, same, as, a, part, of, the, morning, prayer, services, on, certain, days, of, the, week, fast, days, and, holidays, as, well, as, part, of, the, afternoon, prayer, services, of, shabbat, yom, kippur, a, section, of, the, pentateuch, is, read,

although, such, customs, vary, among, synagogues, congregants, traditionally, stand, in, respect, when, the, torah, is, brought, out, of, the, ark, to, be, read, while, it, is, being, carried, and, lifted, and, likewise, while, it, is, returned, to, the, ark, although, they, may, sit, during, the, reading, itself, the, torah, contains, narratives, statements, of, law, and, statements, of, ethics, collectively, these, laws, usually, called, biblical, law, or, commandments, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, law, of, moses, torat, mosh, mosaic, law, or, sinaitic, law, rabbinic, tradition, holds, that, moses, learned, the, whole, torah, while, he, lived, on, mount, sinai, for, 40, days, and, nights, and, both, the, oral, and, the, written, torah, were, transmitted, in, parallel, with, each, other, where, the, torah, leaves, words, and, concepts, undefined, and, mentions, procedures, without, explanation, or, instructions, the, reader, is, required, to, seek, out, the, missing, details, from, supplemental, sources, known, as, the, oral, law, or, oral, torah, some, of, the, torah, s, most, prominent, commandments, needing, further, explanation, are, according, to, classical, rabbinic, texts, this, parallel, set, of, material, was, originally, transmitted, to, moses, at, sinai, and, then, from, moses, to, israel, at, that, time, it, was, forbidden, to, write, and, publish, the, oral, law, as, any, writing, would, be, incomplete, and, subject, to, misinterpretation, and, abuse, however, after, exile, dispersion, and, persecution, this, tradition, was, lifted, when, it, became, apparent, that, in, writing, was, the, only, way, to, ensure, that, the, oral, law, could, be, preserved, after, many, years, of, effort, by, a, great, number, of, tannaim, the, oral, tradition, was, written, down, around, 200, ce, by, rabbi, judah, ha, nasi, who, took, up, the, compilation, of, a, nominally, written, version, of, the, oral, law, the, mishnah, other, oral, traditions, from, the, same, time, period, not, entered, into, the, mishnah, were, recorded, as, baraitot, external, teaching, and, the, tosefta, other, traditions, were, written, down, as, midrashim, after, continued, persecution, more, of, the, oral, law, was, committed, to, writing, a, great, many, more, lessons, lectures, and, traditions, only, alluded, to, in, the, few, hundred, pages, of, mishnah, became, the, thousands, of, pages, now, called, the, gemara, gemara, is, written, in, aramaic, specifically, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, having, been, compiled, in, babylon, the, mishnah, and, gemara, together, are, called, the, talmud, the, rabbis, in, the, land, of, israel, also, collected, their, traditions, and, compiled, them, into, the, jerusalem, talmud, since, the, greater, number, of, rabbis, lived, in, babylon, the, babylonian, talmud, has, precedence, should, the, two, be, in, conflict, orthodox, and, conservative, branches, of, judaism, accept, these, texts, as, the, basis, for, all, subsequent, halakha, and, codes, of, jewish, law, which, are, held, to, be, normative, reform, and, reconstructionist, judaism, deny, that, these, texts, or, the, torah, itself, for, that, matter, may, be, used, for, determining, normative, law, laws, accepted, as, binding, but, accept, them, as, the, authentic, and, only, jewish, version, for, understanding, the, torah, and, its, development, throughout, history, humanistic, judaism, holds, that, the, torah, is, a, historical, political, and, sociological, text, but, does, not, believe, that, every, word, of, the, torah, is, true, or, even, morally, correct, humanistic, judaism, is, willing, to, question, the, torah, and, to, disagree, with, it, believing, that, the, entire, jewish, experience, not, just, the, torah, should, be, the, source, for, jewish, behavior, and, ethics, kabbalists, hold, that, not, only, do, the, words, of, torah, give, a, divine, message, but, they, also, indicate, a, far, greater, message, that, extends, beyond, them, thus, they, hold, that, even, as, small, a, mark, as, a, kotso, shel, yod, the, serif, of, the, hebrew, letter, yod, the, smallest, letter, or, decorative, markings, or, repeated, words, were, put, there, by, god, to, teach, scores, of, lessons, this, is, regardless, of, whether, that, yod, appears, in, the, phrase, i, am, the, lord, thy, god, exodus, 20, 2, or, whether, it, appears, in, and, god, spoke, unto, moses, saying, exodus, 6, 2, in, a, similar, vein, rabbi, akiva, c, 50, c, 135, ce, is, said, to, have, learned, a, new, law, from, every, et, in, the, torah, talmud, tractate, pesachim, 22b, the, particle, et, is, meaningless, by, itself, and, serves, only, to, mark, the, direct, object, in, other, words, the, orthodox, belief, is, that, even, apparently, contextual, text, such, as, and, god, spoke, unto, moses, saying, is, no, less, holy, and, sacred, than, the, actual, statement, manuscript, torah, scrolls, are, still, scribed, and, used, for, ritual, purposes, i, e, religious, services, this, is, called, a, sefer, torah, book, torah, they, are, written, using, a, painstakingly, careful, method, by, highly, qualified, scribes, it, is, believed, that, every, word, or, marking, has, divine, meaning, and, that, not, one, part, may, be, inadvertently, changed, lest, it, lead, to, error, the, fidelity, of, the, hebrew, text, of, the, tanakh, and, the, torah, in, particular, is, considered, paramount, down, to, the, last, letter, translations, or, transcriptions, are, frowned, upon, for, formal, service, use, and, transcribing, is, done, with, painstaking, care, an, error, of, a, single, letter, ornamentation, or, symbol, of, the, 304, 805, stylized, letters, that, make, up, the, hebrew, torah, text, renders, a, torah, scroll, unfit, for, use, hence, a, special, skill, is, required, and, a, scroll, takes, considerable, time, to, write, and, check, according, to, jewish, law, a, sefer, torah, plural, sifrei, torah, is, a, copy, of, the, formal, hebrew, text, handwritten, on, gevil, or, klaf, forms, of, parchment, by, using, a, quill, or, other, permitted, writing, utensil, dipped, in, ink, written, entirely, in, hebrew, a, sefer, torah, contains, 304, 805, letters, all, of, which, must, be, duplicated, precisely, by, a, trained, sofer, scribe, an, effort, that, may, take, as, long, as, approximately, one, and, a, half, years, most, modern, sifrei, torah, are, written, with, forty, two, lines, of, text, per, column, yemenite, jews, use, fifty, and, very, strict, rules, about, the, position, and, appearance, of, the, hebrew, letters, are, observed, see, for, example, the, mishnah, berurah, on, the, subject, any, of, several, hebrew, scripts, may, be, used, most, of, which, are, fairly, ornate, and, exacting, the, completion, of, the, sefer, torah, is, a, cause, for, great, celebration, and, it, is, a, mitzvah, for, every, jew, to, either, write, or, have, written, for, him, a, sefer, torah, torah, scrolls, are, stored, in, the, holiest, part, of, the, synagogue, in, the, ark, known, as, the, holy, ark, aron, hakodesh, in, hebrew, aron, in, hebrew, means, cupboard, or, closet, and, kodesh, is, derived, from, kadosh, or, holy, the, book, of, ezra, refers, to, translations, and, commentaries, of, the, hebrew, text, into, aramaic, the, more, commonly, understood, language, of, the, time, these, translations, would, seem, to, date, to, the, 6th, century, bce, the, aramaic, term, for, translation, is, targum, the, encyclopaedia, judaica, has, at, an, early, period, it, was, customary, to, translate, the, hebrew, text, into, the, vernacular, at, the, time, of, the, reading, e, g, in, palestine, and, babylon, the, translation, was, into, aramaic, the, targum, translation, was, done, by, a, special, synagogue, official, called, the, meturgeman, eventually, the, practice, of, translating, into, the, vernacular, was, discontinued, however, there, is, no, suggestion, that, these, translations, had, been, written, down, as, early, as, this, there, are, suggestions, that, the, targum, was, written, down, at, an, early, date, although, for, private, use, only, the, official, recognition, of, a, written, targum, and, the, final, redaction, of, its, text, however, belong, to, the, post, talmudic, period, thus, not, earlier, than, the, fifth, century, c, e, one, of, the, earliest, known, translations, of, the, first, five, books, of, moses, from, the, hebrew, into, greek, was, the, septuagint, this, is, a, koine, greek, version, of, the, hebrew, bible, that, was, used, by, greek, speakers, this, greek, version, of, the, hebrew, scriptures, dates, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, originally, associated, with, hellenistic, judaism, it, contains, both, a, translation, of, the, hebrew, and, additional, and, variant, material, later, translations, into, greek, include, seven, or, more, other, versions, these, do, not, survive, except, as, fragments, and, include, those, by, aquila, symmachus, and, theodotion, early, translations, into, latin, the, vetus, latina, were, ad, hoc, conversions, of, parts, of, the, septuagint, with, saint, jerome, in, the, 4th, century, ce, came, the, vulgate, latin, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, from, the, eighth, century, ce, the, cultural, language, of, jews, living, under, islamic, rule, became, arabic, rather, than, aramaic, around, that, time, both, scholars, and, lay, people, started, producing, translations, of, the, bible, into, judeo, arabic, using, the, hebrew, alphabet, later, by, the, 10th, century, it, became, essential, for, a, standard, version, of, the, bible, in, judeo, arabic, the, best, known, was, produced, by, saadiah, the, saadia, gaon, aka, the, rasag, and, continues, to, be, in, use, today, in, particular, among, yemenite, jewry, rav, sa, adia, produced, an, arabic, translation, of, the, torah, known, as, targum, tafsir, and, offered, comments, on, rasag, s, work, there, is, a, debate, in, scholarship, whether, rasag, wrote, the, first, arabic, translation, of, the, torah, the, torah, has, been, translated, by, jewish, scholars, into, most, of, the, major, european, languages, including, english, german, russian, french, spanish, and, others, the, most, well, known, german, language, translation, was, produced, by, samson, raphael, hirsch, a, number, of, jewish, english, bible, translations, have, been, published, for, example, by, artscroll, publications, as, a, part, of, the, christian, biblical, canons, the, torah, has, been, translated, into, hundreds, of, languages, the, samaritan, torah, t, r, also, called, the, samaritan, pentateuch, is, a, slightly, different, version, of, the, torah, written, in, the, samaritan, script, and, used, as, sacred, scripture, by, the, samaritans, it, forms, the, entire, textual, document, of, samaritanism, although, different, christian, denominations, have, slightly, different, versions, of, the, old, testament, in, their, bibles, the, torah, as, the, five, books, of, moses, or, the, mosaic, law, is, common, among, them, all, islam, states, that, the, torah, was, sent, by, god, the, tawrat, arabic, is, the, arabic, name, for, the, torah, within, its, context, as, an, islamic, holy, book, believed, by, muslims, to, be, given, by, god, to, prophets, among, the, children, of, israel, and, often, refers, to, the, entire, hebrew, bible, according, to, the, quran, god, says, it, is, he, who, has, sent, down, the, book, the, quran, to, you, with, truth, confirming, what, came, before, it, and, he, sent, down, the, taurat, torah, and, the, injeel, gospel, q3, 3, however, the, muslims, believe, that, this, original, revelation, was, corrupted, tahrif, or, simply, altered, by, the, passage, of, time, and, human, fallibility, over, time, by, jewish, scribes, the, torah, in, the, quran, is, always, mentioned, with, respect, in, islam, the, muslims, belief, in,
