destructive, since, the, pathet, lao, sought, to, make, use, of, the, sangha, for, political, ends, by, imposing, direct, state, control, during, the, late, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, official, attitudes, toward, buddhism, began, to, liberalise, in, laos, and, there, was, a, resurgence, of, traditional, buddhist, activities, such, as, merit, making, and, doctrinal, study, the, modern, era, also, saw, the, spread, of, therav, da, buddhism, around, the, world, and, the, revival, of, the, religion, in, places, where, it, remains, a, minority, faith, some, of, the, major, events, of, the, spread, of, modern, therav, da, include, according, to, kate, crosby, for, therav, da, the, p, li, tipi, aka, also, known, as, the, p, li, canon, is, the, highest, authority, on, what, constitutes, the, dhamma, the, truth, or, teaching, of, the, buddha, and, the, organization, of, the, sangha, the, community, of, monks, and, nuns, the, language, of, the, tipi, aka, p, li, is, a, middle, indic, language, which, is, the, main, religious, and, scholarly, language, in, therav, da, this, language, may, have, evolved, out, of, various, indian, dialects, and, is, related, to, but, not, the, same, as, the, ancient, language, of, magadha, an, early, form, of, the, tipi, aka, may, have, been, transmitted, to, sri, lanka, during, the, reign, of, ashoka, which, saw, a, period, of, buddhist, missionary, activity, after, being, orally, transmitted, as, was, the, custom, for, religious, texts, in, those, days, for, some, centuries, the, texts, were, finally, committed, to, writing, in, the, 1st, century, bce, therav, da, is, one, of, the, first, buddhist, schools, to, commit, its, tipi, aka, to, writing, the, recension, of, the, tipi, aka, which, survives, today, is, that, of, the, sri, lankan, mahavihara, sect, the, oldest, manuscripts, of, the, tipi, aka, from, sri, lanka, and, southeast, asia, date, to, the, 15th, century, and, they, are, incomplete, complete, manuscripts, of, the, four, nikayas, are, only, available, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, however, fragments, of, the, tipi, aka, have, been, found, in, inscriptions, from, southeast, asia, the, earliest, of, which, have, been, dated, to, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, according, to, alexander, wynne, they, agree, almost, exactly, with, extant, p, li, manuscripts, this, means, that, the, p, li, tipi, aka, has, been, transmitted, with, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, for, well, over, 1, 500, years, there, are, numerous, editions, of, the, tipi, aka, some, of, the, major, modern, editions, include, the, pali, text, society, edition, published, in, roman, script, the, burmese, sixth, council, edition, in, burmese, script, 1954, 56, and, the, thai, tipi, aka, edited, and, published, in, thai, script, after, the, council, held, during, the, reign, of, rama, vii, 1925, 35, there, is, also, a, khmer, edition, published, in, phnom, penh, 1931, 69, the, p, li, tipitaka, consists, of, three, parts, the, vinaya, pitaka, sutta, pitaka, and, abhidhamma, pitaka, of, these, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, is, believed, to, be, a, later, addition, to, the, collection, its, composition, dating, from, around, the, 3rd, century, bce, onwards, the, p, li, abhidhamma, was, not, recognized, outside, the, therav, da, school, there, are, also, some, texts, which, were, late, additions, that, are, included, in, the, fifth, nikaya, the, khuddaka, nik, ya, minor, collection, such, as, the, pa, isambhid, magga, possibly, c, 3rd, to, 1st, century, bce, and, the, buddhava, sa, c, 1st, and, 2nd, century, bce, the, main, parts, of, the, sutta, pitaka, and, some, portions, of, the, vinaya, show, considerable, overlap, in, content, with, the, agamas, the, parallel, collections, used, by, non, therav, da, schools, in, india, which, are, preserved, in, chinese, and, partially, in, sanskrit, prakrit, and, tibetan, as, well, as, the, various, non, therav, da, vinayas, on, this, basis, these, early, buddhist, texts, i, e, the, nikayas, and, parts, of, the, vinaya, are, generally, believed, to, be, some, of, the, oldest, and, most, authoritative, sources, on, the, doctrines, of, pre, sectarian, buddhism, by, modern, scholars, much, of, the, material, in, the, earlier, portions, is, not, specifically, therav, dan, but, the, collection, of, teachings, that, this, school, s, adherents, preserved, from, the, early, non, sectarian, body, of, teachings, according, to, peter, harvey, while, the, therav, dans, may, have, added, texts, to, their, tipi, aka, such, as, the, abhidhamma, texts, and, so, on, they, generally, did, not, tamper, with, the, earlier, material, the, historically, later, parts, of, the, canon, mainly, the, abhidhamma, and, some, parts, of, the, vinaya, contain, some, distinctive, elements, and, teachings, which, are, unique, to, the, therav, da, school, and, often, differ, from, the, abhidharmas, or, vinayas, of, other, early, buddhist, schools, for, example, while, the, therav, da, vinaya, contains, a, total, of, 227, monastic, rules, for, bhikkhus, the, dharmaguptaka, vinaya, used, in, east, asian, buddhism, has, a, total, of, 253, rules, for, bhikkhus, though, the, overall, structure, is, the, same, these, differences, arose, from, the, systematization, and, historical, development, of, doctrines, and, monasticism, in, the, centuries, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, contains, a, restatement, of, the, doctrine, of, the, buddha, in, strictly, formalized, language, its, texts, present, a, new, method, the, abhidhamma, method, which, attempts, to, build, a, single, consistent, philosophical, system, in, contrast, with, the, suttas, which, present, numerous, teachings, given, by, the, buddha, to, particular, individuals, according, to, their, needs, because, the, abhidhamma, focuses, on, analyzing, the, internal, lived, experience, of, beings, and, the, intentional, structure, of, consciousness, it, has, often, been, compared, to, a, kind, of, phenomenological, psychology, by, numerous, modern, scholars, such, as, nyanaponika, bhikkhu, bodhi, and, alexander, piatigorsky, the, therav, da, school, has, traditionally, held, the, doctrinal, position, that, the, canonical, abhidhamma, pitaka, was, actually, taught, by, the, buddha, himself, modern, scholarship, in, contrast, has, generally, held, that, the, abhidhamma, texts, date, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, onwards, however, some, scholars, such, as, frauwallner, also, hold, that, the, early, abhidhamma, texts, developed, out, of, exegetical, and, catechetical, work, which, made, use, of, doctrinal, lists, which, can, be, seen, in, the, suttas, called, matikas, there, are, numerous, therav, da, works, which, are, important, for, the, tradition, even, though, they, are, not, part, of, the, tipi, aka, perhaps, the, most, important, texts, apart, from, the, tipi, aka, are, the, works, of, the, influential, scholar, buddhaghosa, 4th, 5th, century, ce, known, for, his, p, li, commentaries, which, were, based, on, older, sri, lankan, commentaries, of, the, mahavihara, tradition, he, is, also, the, author, of, a, very, important, compendium, of, therav, da, doctrine, the, visuddhimagga, other, figures, like, dhammapala, and, buddhadatta, also, wrote, therav, da, commentaries, and, other, works, in, pali, during, the, time, of, buddhaghosa, while, these, texts, do, not, have, the, same, scriptural, authority, in, therav, da, as, the, tipi, aka, they, remain, influential, works, for, the, exegesis, of, the, tipi, aka, an, important, genre, of, therav, din, literature, is, shorter, handbooks, and, summaries, which, serve, as, introductions, and, study, guides, for, the, larger, commentaries, two, of, the, more, influential, summaries, are, sariputta, thera, s, p, limuttakavinayavinicchayasa, gaha, a, summary, of, buddhaghosa, s, vinaya, commentary, and, anuruddha, s, abhidhamma, hasa, gaha, a, manual, of, abhidhamma, throughout, the, history, of, therav, da, therav, da, monks, also, produced, other, works, of, p, li, literature, such, as, historical, chronicles, like, the, dipavamsa, and, the, mahavamsa, hagiographies, poetry, p, li, grammars, and, sub, commentaries, that, is, commentaries, on, the, commentaries, while, p, li, texts, are, symbolically, and, ritually, important, for, many, therav, dins, most, people, are, likely, to, access, buddhist, teachings, through, vernacular, literature, oral, teachings, sermons, art, and, performance, as, well, as, films, and, internet, media, according, to, kate, crosby, there, is, a, far, greater, volume, of, therav, da, literature, in, vernacular, languages, than, in, p, li, an, important, genre, of, therav, din, literature, in, both, p, li, and, vernacular, languages, are, the, jataka, tales, stories, of, the, buddha, s, past, lives, they, are, very, popular, among, all, classes, and, are, rendered, in, a, wide, variety, of, media, formats, from, cartoons, to, high, literature, the, vessantara, j, taka, is, one, of, the, most, popular, of, these, most, therav, da, buddhists, generally, consider, mah, y, na, buddhist, scriptures, to, be, apocryphal, meaning, that, they, are, not, authentic, words, of, the, buddha, the, core, of, therav, da, buddhist, doctrine, is, contained, in, the, p, li, canon, the, only, complete, collection, of, early, buddhist, texts, surviving, in, a, classical, indic, language, these, basic, buddhist, ideas, are, shared, by, the, other, early, buddhist, schools, as, well, as, by, mahayana, traditions, they, include, central, concepts, such, as, therav, da, scholastics, developed, a, systematic, exposition, of, the, buddhist, doctrine, called, the, abhidhamma, in, the, p, li, nikayas, the, buddha, teaches, through, an, analytical, method, in, which, experience, is, explained, using, various, conceptual, groupings, of, physical, and, mental, processes, which, are, called, dhammas, examples, of, lists, of, dhammas, taught, by, the, buddha, include, the, twelve, sense, spheres, or, ayatanas, the, five, aggregates, or, khandha, and, the, eighteen, elements, of, cognition, or, dhatus, therav, da, traditionally, promotes, itself, as, the, vibhajjav, da, teaching, of, analysis, and, as, the, heirs, to, the, buddha, s, analytical, method, expanding, this, model, therav, da, abhidhamma, scholasticism, concerned, itself, with, analyzing, ultimate, truth, paramattha, sacca, which, it, sees, as, being, composed, of, all, possible, dhammas, and, their, relationships, the, central, theory, of, the, abhidhamma, is, thus, known, as, the, dhamma, theory, dhamma, has, been, translated, as, factors, collett, cox, psychic, characteristics, bronkhorst, psycho, physical, events, noa, ronkin, and, phenomena, nyanaponika, thera, according, to, the, sri, lankan, scholar, y, karunadasa, a, dhammas, principles, or, elements, are, those, items, that, result, when, the, process, of, analysis, is, taken, to, its, ultimate, limits, however, this, does, not, mean, that, they, have, an, independent, existence, for, it, is, only, for, the, purposes, of, description, that, they, are, postulated, noa, ronkin, defines, dhammas, as, the, constituents, of, sentient, experience, the, irreducible, building, blocks, that, make, up, one, s, world, albeit, they, are, not, static, mental, contents, and, certainly, not, substances, thus, while, in, therav, da, abhidhamma, dhammas, are, the, ultimate, constituents, of, experience, they, are, not, seen, as, substances, essences, or, independent, particulars, since, they, are, empty, su, a, of, a, self, att, and, conditioned, this, is, spelled, out, in, the, patisambhidhamagga, which, states, that, dhammas, are, empty, of, svabhava, sabhavena, su, am, according, to, ronkin, the, canonical, p, li, abhidhamma, remains, pragmatic, and, psychological, and, does, not, take, much, interest, in, ontology, in, contrast, with, the, sarvastivada, tradition, paul, williams, also, notes, that, the, abhidhamma, remains, focused, on, the, practicalities, of, insight, meditation, and, leaves, ontology, relatively, unexplored, ronkin, does, note, however, that, later, therav, da, sub, commentaries, k, do, show, a, doctrinal, shift, towards, ontological, realism, from, the, earlier, epistemic, and, practical, concerns, on, the, other, hand, y, karunadasa, contends, that, the, tradition, of, realism, goes, back, to, the, earliest, discourses, as, opposed, to, developing, only, in, later, theravada, sub, commentaries, if, we, base, ourselves, on, the, pali, nikayas, then, we, should, be, compelled, to, conclude, that, buddhism, is, realistic, there, is, no, explicit, denial, anywhere, of, the, external, world, nor, is, there, any, positive, evidence, to, show, that, the, world, is, mind, made, or, simply, a, projection, of, subjective, thoughts, that, buddhism, recognizes, the, extra, mental, existence, of, matter, and, the, external, world, is, clearly, suggested, by, the, texts, throughout, the, discourses, it, is, the, language, of, realism, that, one, encounters, the, whole, buddhist, practical, doctrine, and, discipline, which, has, the, attainment, of, nibbana, as, its, final, goal, is, based, on, the, recognition, of, the, material, world, and, the, conscious, living, beings, living, therein, the, therav, da, abhidhamma, holds, that, there, is, a, total, of, 82, possible, types, of, dhammas, 81, of, these, are, conditioned, sankhata, while, one, is, unconditioned, which, is, nibbana, the, 81, conditioned, dhammas, are, divided, into, three, broad, categories, consciousness, citta, associated, mentality, cetasika, and, materiality, or, physical, phenomena, rupa, since, no, dhamma, exists, independently, every, single, dhamma, of, consciousness, known, as, a, citta, arises, associated, sampayutta, with, at, least, seven, mental, factors, cetasikas, in, abhidhamma, all, awareness, events, are, thus, seen, as, being, characterized, by, intentionality, and, never, exist, in, isolation, much, of, abhidhamma, philosophy, deals, with, categorizing, the, different, consciousnesses, and, their, accompanying, mental, factors, as, well, as, their, conditioned, relationships, paccaya, the, p, li, tipi, aka, outlines, a, hierarchical, cosmological, system, with, various, planes, existence, bhava, into, which, sentient, beings, may, be, reborn, depending, on, their, past, actions, good, actions, lead, one, to, the, higher, realms, bad, actions, lead, to, the, lower, realms, however, even, for, the, gods, devas, in, the, higher, realms, like, indra, there, is, still, death, loss, and, suffering, the, main, categories, of, the, planes, of, existence, are, these, various, planes, of, existence, can, be, found, in, countless, world, systems, loka, dhatu, which, are, born, expand, contract, and, are, destroyed, in, a, cyclical, nature, across, vast, expanses, of, time, measures, in, kappas, this, cosmology, is, similar, to, other, ancient, indian, systems, such, as, the, jain, cosmology, this, entire, cyclical, multiverse, of, constant, birth, and, death, is, called, samsara, outside, of, this, system, of, samsara, is, nibbana, lit, vanishing, quenching, blowing, out, a, deathless, amata, and, transcendent, reality, which, is, a, total, and, final, release, vimutti, from, all, suffering, dukkha, and, rebirth, according, to, therav, da, doctrine, release, from, suffering, i, e, nibbana, is, attained, in, four, stages, of, awakening, bodhi, in, therav, da, buddhism, a, buddha, is, a, sentient, being, who, has, discovered, the, path, out, of, samsara, by, themselves, has, reached, nibbana, and, then, makes, the, path, available, to, others, by, teaching, known, as, turning, the, wheel, of, the, dhamma, a, buddha, is, also, believed, to, have, extraordinary, powers, and, abilities, abhi, such, as, the, ability, to, read, minds, and, fly, through, the, air, the, therav, da, canon, depicts, gautama, buddha, as, being, the, most, recent, buddha, in, a, line, of, previous, buddhas, stretching, back, for, aeons, they, also, mention, the, future, buddha, named, metteyya, traditionally, the, therav, da, school, also, rejects, the, idea, that, there, can, be, numerous, buddhas, active, in, the, world, at, the, same, time, regarding, the, question, of, how, a, sentient, being, becomes, a, buddha, the, therav, da, school, also, includes, a, presentation, of, this, path, indeed, according, to, buddhaghosa, there, are, three, main, soteriological, paths, the, path, of, the, buddhas, buddhay, na, the, way, of, the, individual, buddhas, paccekabuddhay, na, and, the, way, of, the, disciples, s, vakay, na, however, unlike, in, mahayana, buddhism, the, therav, da, holds, that, the, buddha, path, is, not, for, everyone, and, that, beings, on, the, buddha, path, bodhisattas, are, quite, rare, while, in, mahayana, bodhisattas, refers, to, beings, who, have, developed, the, wish, to, become, buddhas, therav, da, like, other, early, buddhist, schools, defines, a, bodhisatta, as, someone, who, has, made, a, resolution, abhin, h, ra, to, become, a, buddha, in, front, of, a, living, buddha, and, has, also, received, a, confirmation, from, that, buddha, that, they, will, reach, buddhahood, dhammapala, s, cariy, pi, aka, is, a, therav, da, text, which, focuses, on, the, path, of, the, buddhas, while, the, nid, nakath, and, the, buddhava, sa, are, also, therav, da, texts, which, discuss, the, buddha, path, the, orthodox, standpoints, of, therav, da, in, comparison, to, other, buddhist, schools, are, presented, in, the, kath, vatthu, points, of, controversy, as, well, as, in, other, works, by, later, commentators, like, buddhaghosa, traditionally, the, therav, da, maintains, the, following, key, doctrinal, positions, though, not, all, therav, dins, agree, with, the, traditional, point, of, view, the, modern, era, saw, new, developments, in, therav, da, scholarship, due, to, the, influence, of, western, thought, as, donald, k, swearer, writes, although, monastic, education, is, still, grounded, in, the, study, of, buddhist, texts, doctrine, and, the, pali, language, the, curricula, of, monastic, colleges, and, universities, also, reflect, subject, matter, and, disciplines, associated, with, western, education, buddhist, modernist, trends, can, be, traced, to, figures, like, anagarika, dhammapala, king, mongkut, and, the, first, prime, minister, of, burma, u, nu, they, promoted, a, form, of, buddhism, that, was, compatible, with, rationalism, and, science, and, opposed, to, superstition, and, certain, folk, practices, walpola, rahula, s, what, the, buddha, taught, is, seen, by, scholars, as, an, introduction, to, modernist, buddhist, thought, and, the, book, continues, to, be, widely, used, in, universities, another, modern, phenomenon, is, buddhist, philosophers, who, received, an, education, in, the, west, such, as, k, n, jayatilleke, a, student, of, wittgenstein, at, cambridge, and, hammalawa, saddhatissa, who, received, his, phd, at, edinburgh, going, on, to, write, modern, works, on, buddhist, philosophy, early, buddhist, theory, of, knowledge, 1963, and, buddhist, ethics, 1987, respectively, henepola, gunaratana, is, another, modern, therav, da, scholar, who, studied, philosophy, in, the, west, at, the, american, university, the, modern, encounter, with, christian, missionaries, also, led, to, new, debates, such, as, the, panadura, debate, and, doctrinal, works, written, in, defense, of, buddhism, or, attacking, christian, ideas, such, as, gunapala, dharmasiri, s, a, buddhist, critique, of, the, christian, concept, of, god, 1988, there, have, also, been, several, modern, therav, da, scholars, which, have, taken, a, historical, critical, perspective, on, therav, da, literature, and, doctrine, attempting, to, understand, its, historical, development, some, of, these, figures, such, as, david, kalupahana, buddhadasa, and, bhikkhu, sujato, have, criticized, traditional, therav, da, commentators, like, buddhaghosa, for, their, doctrinal, innovations, which, differ, in, significant, ways, from, the, early, buddhist, texts, the, modern, era, also, saw, new, buddhist, works, on, topics, which, pre, modern, buddhists, avoided, such, as, socially, engaged, buddhism, and, buddhist, economics, thinkers, such, as, buddhadasa, sulak, sivaraksa, prayudh, payutto, neville, karunatilake, and, padmasiri, de, silva, have, written, on, these, topics, modern, scholarship, in, western, languages, by, western, buddhist, monks, such, as, nyanatiloka, nyanaponika, nyanamoli, bhikkhu, bodhi, and, analayo, is, another, recent, development, in, the, therav, da, world, in, the, p, li, canon, the, path, magga, or, way, patipada, of, buddhist, practice, is, described, in, various, ways, one, of, the, most, widely, used, frameworks, in, therav, da, is, the, noble, eightfold, path, the, blessed, one, said, now, what, monks, is, the, noble, eightfold, path, right, view, right, resolve, right, speech, right, action, right, livelihood, right, effort, right, mindfulness, right, concentration, the, noble, eightfold, path, can, also, be, summarized, as, the, three, noble, disciplines, of, s, la, moral, conduct, or, discipline, sam, dhi, meditation, or, concentration, and, pa, understanding, or, wisdom, therav, da, orthodoxy, takes, the, seven, stages, of, purification, as, outlined, in, the, visuddhimagga, as, the, basic, outline, of, the, path, to, be, followed, the, visuddhimagga, a, sinhala, therav, da, doctrinal, summa, written, in, the, fifth, century, by, buddhaghosa, became, the, orthodox, account, of, the, therav, da, path, to, liberation, in, sri, lanka, after, the, 12th, century, and, this, influence, spread, to, other, therav, da, nations, it, gives, the, sequence, of, seven, purifications, in, three, sections, this, basic, outline, is, based, on, the, threefold, discipline, the, emphasis, is, on, understanding, the, three, marks, of, existence, which, removes, ignorance, understanding, destroys, the, ten, fetters, and, leads, to, nibbana, therav, dins, believe, that, every, individual, is, personally, responsible, for, achieving, their, own, self, awakening, and, liberation, each, being, responsible, for, their, own, karma, actions, and, consequences, applying, knowledge, acquired, through, direct, experience, and, personal, realization, is, more, heavily, emphasized, than, beliefs, about, the, nature, of, reality, as, revealed, by, the, buddha, giving, dana, is, an, important, buddhist, virtue, the, community, of, monastics, is, seen, as, the, most, meritorious, field, of, karmic, fruitfulness, s, la, meaning, moral, conduct, is, mainly, defined, as, right, speech, right, action, and, right, livelihood, it, is, primarily, understood, through, the, doctrine, of, kamma, in, therav, da, one, s, previous, intentional, actions, strongly, influence, one, s, present, experience, whatever, intended, actions, are, carried, out,

therav, din, buddhists, traditionally, take, the, five, precepts, whether, for, life, or, for, a, limited, time, in, the, presence, of, sangha, laypeople, also, sometimes, take, an, extended, set, of, eight, precepts, which, includes, chastity, during, sacred, days, of, observance, such, as, uposatha, performing, good, deeds, is, another, important, feature, of, therav, din, buddhist, ethics,

to, become, or, cultivation, means, the, positive, cultivation, of, one, s, mind, therav, da, buddhist, meditation, practice, varies, considerably, in, technique, and, objects, currently, there, are, also, various, traditions, of, therav, da, meditation, practice, such, as, the, burmese, vipassana, tradition, the, thai, forest, tradition, the, esoteric, bor, n, kamma, h, na, ancient, practices, the, burmese, weikza, tradition, dhammakaya, meditation, and, the, western, insight, meditation, movement, therav, da, buddhist, meditation, practices, or, bhavana, mental, cultivation, are, categorized, into, two, broad, categories, samatha, bhavana, calming, and, vipassan, bhavana, investigation, insight, originally, these, referred, to, effects, or, qualities, of, meditation, but, after, the, time, of, buddhaghosa, they, also, referred, to, two, distinct, meditation, types, or, paths, y, na, samatha, calm, consists, of, meditation, techniques, in, which, the, mind, is, focused, on, a, single, object, thought, or, gatha, leading, to, sam, dhi, in, traditional, therav, da, it, is, considered, to, be, the, base, for, vipassan, insight, in, the, therav, da, tradition, as, early, as, the, p, li, nikayas, the, four, jh, nas, are, regarded, as, a, samatha, practice, the, eighth, and, final, step, of, the, eightfold, path, right, samadhi, is, often, defined, as, the, four, jhanas, in, the, p, li, nikayas, jh, nas, are, described, as, preceding, the, awakening, insight, of, the, buddha, which, turned, him, into, an, awakened, being, yet, the, interpretation, of, jhana, as, single, pointed, concentration, and, calm, may, be, a, later, re, interpretation, in, which, the, original, aim, of, jhana, was, lost, vipassana, insight, clear, seeing, refers, to, practices, that, aim, to, develop, an, inner, understanding, or, knowledge, of, the, nature, of, phenomena, dhammas, especially, the, characteristics, of, dukkha, anatta, and, anicca, which, are, seen, as, being, universally, applicable, to, all, constructed, phenomena, sankhata, dhammas, vipassana, is, also, described, as, insight, into, dependent, origination, the, five, aggregates, the, sense, spheres, and, the, four, noble, truths, it, is, the, primary, focus, of, the, modernist, burmese, vipassana, movement, in, western, countries, it, is, complemented, with, the, four, divine, abidings, the, development, of, loving, kindness, and, compassion, vipassana, practice, begins, with, the, preparatory, stage, the, practice, of, sila, morality, giving, up, worldly, thoughts, and, desires, the, practitioner, then, engages, in, anapanasati, mindfulness, of, breathing, which, is, described, in, the, satipatthana, sutta, as, going, into, the, forest, and, sitting, beneath, a, tree, and, then, simply, to, watch, the, breath, if, the, breath, is, long, to, notice, that, the, breath, is, long, if, the, breath, is, short, to, notice, that, the, breath, is, short, in, the, new, burmese,

without, engaging, the, phenomenon, with, conceptual, thinking, by, noticing, the, arising, of, physical, and, mental, phenomena, the, meditator, becomes, aware, of, how, sense, impressions, arise, from, the, contact, between, the, senses, and, physical, and, mental, phenomena, as, described, in, the, five, skandhas, and, pa, iccasamupp, da, the, practitioner, also, becomes, aware, of, the, perpetual, changes, involved, in, breathing, and, the, arising, and, passing, away, of, mindfulness, this, noticing, is, accompanied, by, reflections, on, causation, and, other, buddhist, teachings, leading, to, insight, into, dukkha, anatta, and, anicca, when, the, three, characteristics, have, been, comprehended, reflection, subdues, and, the, process, of, noticing, accelerates, noting, phenomena, in, general, without, necessarily, naming, them, according, to, vajiran, a, mahathera, writing, from, a, traditional, and, text, based, point, of, view, in, the, p, li, canon, whether, one, begins, the, practice, by, way, of, samatha, or, by, way, of, vipassan, is, generally, seen, as, depending, on, one, s, temperament, according, to, vajiran, a, mahathera, it, is, generally, held, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, individuals, those, of, a, passionate, disposition, or, those, who, enter, the, path, by, faith, attain, arahatship, through, vipassan, preceded, by, samatha, those, of, a, skeptical, disposition, or, those, who, enter, by, way, of, wisdom, or, the, intellect, achieve, it, through, samatha, preceded, by, vipassan, traditionally, the, ultimate, goal, of, the, practice, is, to, achieve, mundane, and, supramundane, wisdom, mundane, wisdom, is, the, insight, in, the, three, marks, of, existence, the, development, of, this, insight, leads, to, four, supramundane, paths, and, fruits, these, experiences, consist, a, direct, apprehension, of, nibbana, supramundane, lokuttara, wisdom, refers, to, that, which, transcends, the, world, of, samsara, apart, from, nibbana, there, are, various, reasons, why, traditional, therav, da, buddhism, advocates, meditation, including, a, good, rebirth, supranormal, powers, combating, fear, and, preventing, danger, recent, modernist, therav, dins, have, tended, to, focus, on, the, psychological, benefits, and, psychological, well, being, the, practice, of, therav, da, meditation, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 5th, century, exegete, buddhaghosa, who, systematized, the, classic, therav, da, meditation, dividing, them, into, samatha, and, vipassana, types, and, listing, 40, different, forms, known, as, kamma, h, nas, workplaces, in, his, magnum, opus, the, visuddhimagga, this, text, has, remained, central, for, the, study, and, practice, of, therav, da, meditation, buddhaghosa, s, commentary, on, the, satipatthana, sutta, bases, of, mindfulness, discourse, as, well, as, the, source, text, itself, are, also, another, important, source, for, meditation, in, this, tradition, buddhaghosa, s, work, drew, heavily, on, the, pali, suttas, as, well, as, the, pali, abhidhamma, kate, crosby, notes, that, buddhaghosa, s, work, also, explicitly, refers, to, the, contemporaneous, existence, of, secret, meditation, manuals, but, not, to, their, content, regarding, post, visuddhimagga, therav, da, meditation, according, to, kate, crosby, in, the, period, between, the, visuddhimagga, and, the, present, there, have, been, numerous, meditation, texts, both, manuals, and, descriptive, treatises, many, of, the, texts, found, in, manuscript, collections, relate, to, meditation, some, on, a, single, simple, subject, such, as, the, recollection, of, the, qualities, of, the, buddha, others, more, complex, little, research, has, been, done, to, assess, their, variety, one, difficulty, is, that, meditation, manuals, as, such, are, often, in, a, mixture, of, a, classical, language, that, is, pali, and, a, vernacular, that, may, or, may, not, be, a, currently, used, language, also, actual, manuals, often, contain, prompts, or, reminders, rather, than, an, in, depth, explanation, in, recent, years, it, has, emerged, that, there, is, still, extant, a, relatively, high, number, of, manuals, and, related, texts, pertaining, to, a, system, of, meditation, called, among, other, things, bor, n, kamma, h, na, or, yog, vacara, its, core, text, the, m, la, kamma, h, na, original, fundamental, or, basic, meditation, practice, circulated, under, a, number, of, different, titles, or, without, a, title, throughout, the, tai, lao, khmer, and, sri, lankan, buddhist, worlds, some, versions, of, this, text, are, simple, lists, of, kamma, h, na, and, from, that, perspective, look, entirely, in, accord, with, the, visuddhimagga, or, theravada, abhidhamma, texts, other, versions, contain, extensive, narratives, explanations, of, symbolism, and, of, the, somatic, locations, involved, in, the, practice, that, make, it, clear, that, we, are, dealing, with, techniques, of, practice, not, described, in, the, canon, or, visuddhimagga, according, to, crosby, the, esoteric, bor, n, kamma, h, na, or, yog, vacara, meditation, tradition, was, the, dominant, form, of, meditation, in, the, therav, da, world, during, the, 18th, century, and, may, date, as, far, back, as, the, 16th, century, crosby, notes, that, this, tradition, of, meditation, involved, a, rich, collection, of, symbols, somatic, methods, and, visualizations, which, included, the, physical, internalisation, or, manifestation, of, aspects, of, the, theravada, path, by, incorporating, them, at, points, in, the, body, between, the, nostril, and, navel, in, spite, of, the, novel, elements, in, this, meditation, tradition, close, study, of, bor, n, kamma, h, na, texts, reveals, that, they, are, closely, connected, to, theravada, abhidhamma, and, the, works, of, buddhaghosa, modernist, reforms, which, emphasized, pali, canon, study, a, shift, in, state, support, to, other, traditions, and, modern, wars, in, indochina, led, to, this, tradition, s, decline, and, it, now, only, survives, in, a, few, cambodian, and, thai, temples, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, therav, da, world, saw, a, modernist, revival, and, reinvention, of, meditation, practice, as, exemplified, by, the, burmese, vipassana, movement, according, to, buswell, vipassana, appears, to, have, fallen, out, of, practice, by, the, 10th, century, due, to, the, belief, that, buddhism, had, degenerated, and, that, liberation, was, no, longer, attainable, until, the, coming, of, maitreya, the, practice, was, revived, in, myanmar, burma, in, the, 18th, century, by, medawi, 1728, 1816, and, by, later, figures, such, as, ledi, sayadaw, and, mah, s, sayadaw, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, these, burmese, figures, re, invented, vipassana, meditation, and, developed, simplified, meditation, techniques, based, on, the, satipatthana, sutta, the, visuddhimagga, and, other, texts, emphasizing, satipatthana, and, bare, insight, these, techniques, were, globally, popularized, by, the, vipassana, movement, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, similar, revival, movements, developed, in, thailand, such, as, the, thai, forest, tradition, and, dhammakaya, meditation, these, traditions, are, influenced, by, the, older, bor, n, kamma, h, na, forms, thailand, and, cambodia, also, saw, attempts, to, preserve, and, revive, the, ancient, bor, n, kamma, h, na, tradition, of, meditation, in, sri, lanka, the, new, buddhist, traditions, of, the, amarapura, and, r, ma, a, nik, yas, developed, their, own, meditation, forms, based, on, the, pali, suttas, the, visuddhimagga, and, other, manuals, while, bor, n, kamma, h, na, mostly, disappeared, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, though, the, vipassana, movement, has, popularised, meditation, both, in, traditional, therav, da, countries, among, the, laity, and, in, western, countries, meditation, plays, a, minor, if, not, negligible, role, in, the, lives, of, the, majority, of, therav, da, monks, meditation, is, especially, popular, laypersons, especially, during, special, religious, holidays, or, in, their, old, age, when, they, have, more, free, time, to, spend, at, the, temple, buddhist, modernists, tend, to, present, buddhism, as, rational, and, scientific, and, this, has, also, affected, how, vipassana, meditation, has, been, taught, and, presented, this, has, led, in, some, quarters, to, a, playing, down, of, older, non, empirical, elements, of, therav, da, associated, with, superstition, strains, of, older, traditional, therav, da, meditation, known, as, bor, n, kamma, h, na, still, exist, but, this, tradition, has, mostly, been, eclipsed, by, the, buddhist, modernist, meditation, movements, laypersons, and, monks, also, perform, various, types, of, religious, practices, daily, or, during, buddhist, holidays, one, of, these, is, keeping, a, buddhist, shrine, with, a, picture, or, statue, of, the, buddha, for, devotional, practice, in, one, s, home, mirroring, the, larger, shrines, at, temples, it, is, common, to, offer, candles, incense, flowers, and, other, objects, to, these, shrine, gestures, of, respect, are, also, done, in, front, of, buddha, images, and, shrines, mainly, the, respectful, salutation, with, the, hands, a, jalikamma, and, the, five, limb, prostration, pa, c, anga, vandana, buddhist, forms, of, chanting, is, also, widely, practiced, by, both, monks, and, laypersons, who, may, recite, famous, phrases, such, as, the, taking, of, refuge, the, metta, sutta, and, the, mangala, sutta, in, front, of, their, shrine, chanting, may, also, be, part, of, the, practice, of, recollection, anussati, which, refers, to, contemplating, various, topics, such, as, the, sublime, qualities, of, the, buddha, dhamma, and, sangha, or, the, five, subjects, for, daily, recollection, this, may, be, done, as, part, of, a, daily, puja, ritual, another, important, religious, practice, for, the, devout, is, the, keeping, of, special, religious, holidays, known, as, uposatha, which, are, based, on, a, lunar, calendar, laypersons, commonly, take, the, eight, precepts, while, visiting, a, temple, or, monastery, and, commit, to, focusing, on, buddhist, practice, for, the, day, study, ganthadhura, of, the, buddhist, texts, and, listening, to, dhamma, talks, by, monks, or, teachers, are, also, important, practices, traditionally, therav, da, buddhism, has, observed, a, distinction, between, the, practices, suitable, for, a, lay, person, and, the, practices, undertaken, by, ordained, monks, in, ancient, times, there, was, a, separate, body, of, practices, for, nuns, while, the, possibility, of, significant, attainment, by, laymen, is, not, entirely, disregarded, by, the, therav, da, it, generally, occupies, a, position, of, less, prominence, than, in, the, mah, y, na, and, vajray, na, traditions, with, monastic, life, being, hailed, as, a, superior, method, of, achieving, nirvana, the, view, that, therav, da, unlike, other, buddhist, schools, is, primarily, a, monastic, tradition, has, however, been, disputed, some, western, scholars, have, erroneously, tried, to, claim, that, mah, y, na, is, primarily, a, religion, for, laymen, and, therav, da, is, a, primarily, monastic, religion, both, mah, y, na, and, therav, da, have, as, their, foundation, strong, monastic, communities, which, are, almost, identical, in, their, regulations, schools, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, without, monastic, communities, of, fully, ordained, monks, and, nuns, are, relatively, recent, and, atypical, developments, usually, based, on, cultural, and, historical, considerations, rather, than, differences, in, fundamental, doctrine, both, mah, y, na, and, therav, da, also, provided, a, clear, and, important, place, for, lay, followers, this, distinction, between, ordained, monks, and, laypeople, as, well, as, the, distinction, between, those, practices, advocated, by, the, p, li, canon, and, the, folk, religious, elements, embraced, by, many, monks, have, motivated, some, scholars, to, consider, therav, da, buddhism, to, be, composed, of, multiple, separate, traditions, overlapping, though, still, distinct, most, prominently, the, anthropologist, melford, spiro, in, his, work, buddhism, and, society, separated, burmese, therav, da, into, three, groups, apotropaic, buddhism, concerned, with, providing, protection, from, evil, spirits, kammatic, buddhism, concerned, with, making, merit, for, a, future, birth, and, nibbanic, buddhism, concerned, with,

of, the, lay, followers, as, taught, by, the, buddha, is, to, look, after, the, needs, of, the, monk, nuns, they, are, to, see, that, the, monk, nuns, do, not, suffer, from, lack, of, the, four, requisites, food, clothing, shelter, and, medicine, as, neither, monks, nor, nuns, are, allowed, to, have, an, occupation, they, depend, entirely, on, the, laity, for, their, sustenance, in, return, for, this, charity, they, are, expected, to, lead, exemplary, lives, in, myanmar, and, thailand, the, monastery, was, and, is, still, regarded, as, a, seat, of, learning, therav, din, monasteries, have, been, providing, free, education, to, many, children, since, ancient, times, in, fact, today, about, half, of, the, primary, schools, in, thailand, are, located, in, monasteries, religious,

and, monks, often, took, up, the, role, of, mediators, in, most, disputes, traditionally, a, ranking, monk, will, deliver, a, sermon, four, times, a, month, when, the, moon, waxes, and, wanes, and, the, day, before, the, new, and, full, moons, the, laity, also, have, a, chance, to, learn, meditation, from, the, monks, during, these, times, it, is, also, possible, for, a, lay, disciple, to, become, enlightened, as, bhikkhu, bodhi, notes, the, suttas, and, commentaries, do, record, a, few, cases, of, lay, disciples, attaining, the, final, goal, of, nirvana, however, such, disciples, either, attain, arahantship, on, the, brink, of, death, or, enter, the, monastic, order, soon, after, their, attainment, they, do, not, continue, to, dwell, at, home, as, arahant, householders, for, dwelling, at, home, is, incompatible, with, the, state, of, one, who, has, severed, all, craving, in, the, modern, era, it, is, now, common, for, lay, disciples, to, practice, meditation, attend, lay, meditation, centers, and, even, aim, for, awakening, the, impetus, for, this, trend, began, in, myanmar, and, was, supported, by, prime, minister, u, nu, who, himself, established, the, international, meditation, center, imc, in, yangon, modern, lay, teachers, such, as, u, ba, khin, who, was, also, the, accountant, general, of, the, union, of, burma, promoted, meditation, as, part, of, a, laypersons, daily, routine, according, to, donald, k, swearer, another, development, in, modern, therav, da, is, the, formation, of, lay, buddhist, associations, that, have, partially, assumed, the, social, service, responsibilities, formerly, associated, with, the, monastery, these, include, social, service, and, activist, organizations, such, as, the, young, men, s, buddhist, association, of,

to, medieval, sri, lanka, 2nd, century, bce, to, 10th, century, ce, such, as, the, mahavamsa, show, that, monastic, roles, in, the, tradition, were, often, seen, as, being, in, a, polarity, between, urban, monks, sinhala, khaamawaasii, p, li, g, mavas, on, one, end, and, rural, forest, monks, sinhala, aranyawaasii, pali, ara, avasi, nagaravasi, also, known, as, tapassin, on, the, other, the,

the, p, li, dhammapada, commentary, mentions, another, split, based, on, the, duty, of, study, and, the, duty, of, contemplation, this, second, division, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, corresponding, with, the, city, forest, split, with, the, city, monks, focusing, on, the, vocation, of, books, ganthadhura, or, learning, pariyatti, while, the, forest, monks, leaning, more, towards, meditation, vipassanadhura, and, practice, patipatti, however, this, opposition, is, not, consistent, and, urban, monasteries, have, often, promoted, meditation, while, forest, communities, have, also, produced, excellent, scholars, such, as, the, island, hermitage, of, nyanatiloka, scholar, monks, generally, undertake, the, path, of, studying, and, preserving, therav, da, s, p, li, literature, forest, monks, tend, to, be, the, minority, among, therav, da, sanghas, and, also, tend, to, focus, on, asceticism, dhutanga, and, meditative, praxis, they, view, themselves, as, living, closer, to, the, ideal, set, forth, by, the, buddha, and, are, often, perceived, as, such, by, lay, folk, while, at, the, same, time, often, being, on, the, margins, of, the, buddhist, establishment, and, on, the, periphery, of, the, social, order, while, this, divide, seems, to, have, been, in, existence, for, some, time, in, the, therav, da, school, only, in, the, 10th, century, is, a, specifically, forest, monk, monastery, mentioned, as, existing, near, anuradhapura, called, tapavana, this, division, was, then, carried, over, into, the, rest, of, southeast, asia, as, therav, da, spread, today, there, are, forest, based, traditions, in, most, therav, da, countries, including, the, sri, lankan, forest, tradition, the, thai, forest, tradition, as, well, as, lesser, known, forest, based, traditions, in, burma, and, laos, such, as, the, burmese, forest, based, monasteries, taw, yar, of, the, pa, auk, sayadaw, in, thailand, forest, monks, are, known, as, phra, thudong, ascetic, wandering, monks, or, phra, thudong, kammathan, wandering, ascetic, meditator, the, minimum, age, for, ordaining, as, a, buddhist, monk, is, 20, years, which, is, calculated, from, conception, those, under, this, age, can, perform, traditional, ceremonies, such, as, shinbyu, in, myanmar, in, order, to, ordain, as, novices, s, ma, era, novices, shave, their, heads, wear, the, yellow, robes, and, observe, the, ten, precepts, while, there, is, no, explicit, minimum, age, for, novices, prescribed, in, the, scriptures, it, is, traditionally, accepted, that, boys, as, young, as, seven, can, be, accepted, for, ordination, this, tradition, echoes, the, story, of, the, buddha, s, son, rahula, who, was, allowed, to, become, a, novice, at, the, age, of, seven, both, monks, and, nuns, are, expected, to, adhere, to, a, specific, code, of, discipline, of, which, monks, follow, 227, rules, and, nuns, follow, 311, in, most, therav, da, countries, it, is, a, common, practice, for, young, men, to, ordain, as, monks, for, a, fixed, period, of, time, in, thailand, and, myanmar, young, men, typically, ordain, for, the, retreat, during, vassa, the, three, month, monsoon, season, though, shorter, or, longer, periods, of, ordination, are, not, rare, traditionally, temporary, ordination, was, even, more, flexible, among, laotians, once, they, had, undergone, their, initial, ordination, as, young, men, laotian, men, were, permitted, to, temporarily, ordain, again, at, any, time, though, married, men, were, expected, to, seek, their, wife, s, permission, throughout, southeast, asia, there, is, little, stigma, attached, to, leaving, the, monastic, life, monks, regularly, leave, the, robes, after, acquiring, an, education, or, when, compelled, by, family, obligations, or, ill, health, ordaining, as, a, monk, even, for, a, short, period, is, seen, as, having, many, virtues, in, many, southeast, asian, cultures, it, is, seen, as, a, means, for, a, young, man, to, repay, his, gratitude, to, his, parents, for, their, work, and, effort, in, raising, him, because, the, merit, from, his, ordination, is, dedicated, for, their, well, being, thai, men, who, have, ordained, as, a, monk, may, be, seen, as, more, mature, and, suitable, husbands, by, thai, women, who, refer, to, men, who, have, served, as, monks, with, a, colloquial, term, meaning, ripe, to, indicate, that, they, are, more, mature, and, ready, for, marriage, particularly, in, rural, areas, temporary, ordination, of, boys, and, young, men, traditionally, offered, peasant, boys, an, opportunity, to, receive, free, education, in, temple, schools, with, sponsorship, and, accommodation, in, sri, lanka, temporary, ordination, is, not, practised, and, a, monk, leaving, the, order, is, frowned, upon, but, not, condemned, the, continuing, influence, of, the, caste, system, in, sri, lanka, plays, a, role, in, the, taboo, against, temporary, or, permanent, ordination, as, a, bhikkhu, in, some, orders, though, sri, lankan, orders, are, often, organized, along, caste, lines, men, who, ordain, as, monks, temporarily, pass, outside, of, the, conventional, caste, system, and, as, such, during, their, time, as, monks, may, act, or, be, treated, in, a, way, that, would, not, be, in, line, with, the, expected, duties, and, privileges, of, their, caste, for, those, born, in, western, countries, who, wish, to, become, buddhist, monks, or, nuns, it, is, possible, to, undertake, the, lifestyle, in, their, home, countries, among, other, buddhist, monastics, in, western, countries, or, to, travel, and, take, up, residence, in, a, buddhist, monastery, in, asian, countries, such, as, sri, lanka, or, thailand, in, countries, where, buddhism, is, deeply, rooted, it, can, often, be, easier, to, adhere, to, the, lifestyle, of, a, monk, or, nun, as, it, requires, considerable, discipline, to, successfully, live, by, the, non, secular, rules, and, regulations, for, which, buddhist, practices, are, known, for, instance, therav, da, monastics, are, typically, required, to, abstain, from, activities, such, as, working, handling, money, listening, to, music, and, cooking, such, obligations, can, be, especially, challenging, in, non, buddhist, societies, some, of, the, more, well, known, therav, din, monks, are, ajahn, mun, ajahn, chah, ledi, sayadaw, webu, sayadaw,
