hermes, h, r, m, i, z, greek, is, an, olympian, deity, in, ancient, greek, religion, and, mythology, considered, the, herald, of, the, gods, he, is, also, widely, considered, the, protector, of, human, heralds, travelers, thieves, merchants, and, orators, he, is, able, to, move, quickly, and, freely, between, the, worlds, of, the, mortal, and, the, divine, aided, by, his, winged, sandals, hermes, plays, the, role, of, the, psychopomp, or, soul, guide, a, conductor, of, souls, into, the, afterlife, 179, 295, in, myth, hermes, functions, as, the, emissary, and, messenger, of, the, gods, and, is, often, presented, as, the, son, of, zeus, and, maia, the, pleiad, he, is, regarded, as, the, divine, trickster, about, which, the, homeric, hymn, to, hermes, offers, the, most, well, known, account, hermes, attributes, and, symbols, include, the, herma, the, rooster, the, tortoise, satchel, or, pouch, talaria, winged, sandals, and, winged, helmet, or, simple, petasos, as, well, as, the, palm, tree, goat, the, number, four, several, kinds, of, fish, and, incense, however, his, main, symbol, is, the, caduceus, a, winged, staff, intertwined, with, two, snakes, copulating, and, carvings, of, the, other, gods, in, roman, mythology, and, religion, many, of, hermes, characteristics, belong, to, mercury, a, name, derived, from, the, latin, merx, meaning, merchandise, and, the, origin, of, the, words, mer, chant, and, com, merce, 178, the, earliest, form, of, the, name, hermes, is, the, mycenaean, greek, herm, h, s, written, e, ma, a, 2, e, ma, ha, in, the, linear, b, syllabic, script, most, scholars, derive, hermes, from, greek, herma, stone, heap, 177, the, etymology, of, itself, is, unknown, but, is, probably, not, a, proto, indo, european, word, r, s, p, beekes, rejects, the, connection, with, herma, and, suggests, a, pre, greek, origin, however, the, stone, etymology, is, also, linked, to, indo, european, ser, to, bind, put, together, scholarly, speculation, that, hermes, derives, from, a, more, primitive, form, meaning, one, cairn, is, disputed, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, hermes, may, be, a, cognate, of, the, vedic, sarama, it, is, likely, that, hermes, is, a, pre, hellenic, god, though, the, exact, origins, of, his, worship, and, its, original, nature, remain, unclear, frothingham, thought, the, god, to, have, existed, as, a, mesopotamian, snake, god, similar, or, identical, to, ningishzida, a, god, who, served, as, mediator, between, humans, and, the, divine, especially, ishtar, and, who, was, depicted, in, art, as, a, caduceus, angelo, 1997, thinks, hermes, to, be, based, on, the, thoth, archetype, the, absorbing, combining, of, the, attributes, of, hermes, to, thoth, developed, after, the, time, of, homer, amongst, greeks, and, romans, herodotus, was, the, first, to, identify, the, greek, god, with, the, egyptian, hermopolis, plutarch, and, diodorus, also, did, so, although, plato, thought, the, gods, were, dissimilar, friedlander, 1992, his, cult, was, established, in, greece, in, remote, regions, likely, making, him, originally, a, god, of, nature, farmers, and, shepherds, it, is, also, possible, that, since, the, beginning, he, has, been, a, deity, with, shamanic, attributes, linked, to, divination, reconciliation, magic, sacrifices, and, initiation, and, contact, with, other, planes, of, existence, a, role, of, mediator, between, the, worlds, of, the, visible, and, invisible, according, to, a, theory, that, has, received, considerable, scholarly, acceptance, hermes, originated, as, a, form, of, the, god, pan, who, has, been, identified, as, a, reflex, of, the, proto, indo, european, pastoral, god, p, h, 2, us, n, in, his, aspect, as, the, god, of, boundary, markers, the, pie, root, peh, 2, protect, also, shows, up, in, latin, pastor, shepherd, whence, the, english, pastoral, a, zero, grade, of, the, full, pie, form, ph, 2, us, n, yields, the, name, of, the, sanskrit, psychopomp, pushan, who, like, pan, is, associated, with, goats, later, the, epithet, supplanted, the, original, name, itself, and, hermes, took, over, the, role, of, psychopomp, and, as, god, of, messengers, travelers, and, boundaries, which, had, originally, belonged, to, pan, while, pan, himself, continued, to, be, venerated, by, his, original, name, in, his, more, rustic, aspect, as, the, god, of, the, wild, in, the, relatively, isolated, mountainous, region, of, arcadia, in, later, myths, after, the, cult, of, pan, was, reintroduced, to, attica, pan, was, said, to, be, hermes, son, the, image, of, hermes, evolved, and, varied, along, with, greek, art, and, culture, in, archaic, greece, he, was, usually, depicted, as, a, mature, man, bearded, and, dressed, as, a, traveler, herald, or, shepherd, this, image, remained, common, on, the, hermai, which, served, as, boundary, markers, roadside, markers, and, grave, markers, as, well, as, votive, offerings, in, classical, and, hellenistic, greece, hermes, was, usually, depicted, as, a, young, athletic, man, lacking, a, beard, when, represented, as, logios, greek, speaker, his, attitude, is, consistent, with, the, attribute, phidias, left, a, statue, of, a, famous, hermes, logios, and, praxiteles, another, also, well, known, showing, him, with, the, baby, dionysus, in, his, arms, at, all, times, however, through, the, hellenistic, periods, roman, and, throughout, western, history, into, the, present, day, several, of, his, characteristic, objects, are, present, as, identification, but, not, always, all, together, among, these, objects, is, a, wide, brimmed, hat, the, petasos, widely, used, by, rural, people, of, antiquity, to, protect, themselves, from, the, sun, and, that, in, later, times, was, adorned, with, a, pair, of, small, wings, sometimes, this, hat, is, not, present, and, may, have, been, replaced, with, wings, rising, from, the, hair, another, object, is, the, caduceus, a, staff, with, two, intertwined, snakes, sometimes, crowned, with, a, pair, of, wings, and, a, sphere, the, caduceus, historically, appeared, with, hermes, and, is, documented, among, the, babylonians, from, about, 3500, bc, two, snakes, coiled, around, a, staff, was, also, a, symbol, of, the, god, ningishzida, who, like, hermes, served, as, a, mediator, between, humans, and, the, divine, specifically, the, goddess, ishtar, or, the, supreme, ningirsu, in, greece, other, gods, have, been, depicted, holding, a, caduceus, but, it, was, mainly, associated, with, hermes, it, was, said, to, have, the, power, to, make, people, fall, asleep, or, wake, up, and, also, made, peace, between, litigants, and, is, a, visible, sign, of, his, authority, being, used, as, a, sceptre, a, similar, appearing, but, distinct, symbol, is, the, rod, of, asclepius, associated, with, the, patron, of, medicine, and, son, of, apollo, asclepius, which, bears, only, one, snake, the, rod, of, asclepius, occasionally, conflated, with, the, caduceus, in, modern, times, is, used, by, most, western, physicians, as, a, badge, of, their, profession, after, the, renaissance, the, caduceus, also, appeared, in, the, heraldic, crests, of, several, and, currently, is, a, symbol, of, commerce, hermes, sandals, called, p, dila, by, the, greeks, and, talaria, by, the, romans, were, made, of, palm, and, myrtle, branches, but, were, described, as, beautiful, golden, and, immortal, made, a, sublime, art, able, to, take, the, roads, with, the, speed, of, wind, originally, they, had, no, wings, but, late, in, the, artistic, representations, they, are, depicted, in, certain, images, the, wings, spring, directly, from, the, ankles, hermes, has, also, been, depicted, with, a, purse, or, a, bag, in, his, hands, wearing, a, robe, or, cloak, which, had, the, power, to, confer, invisibility, his, weapon, was, a, harpe, which, killed, argos, it, was, also, lent, to, perseus, to, kill, medusa, and, cetus, hermes, began, as, a, god, with, strong, chthonic, or, underworld, associations, he, was, a, psychopomp, leader, of, souls, along, the, road, between, the, under, and, the, upper, world, this, function, gradually, expanded, to, encompass, roads, in, general, and, from, there, to, boundaries, travelers, sailors, commerce, and, travel, itself, beginning, with, the, earliest, records, of, his, worship, hermes, has, been, understood, as, a, chthonic, deity, heavily, associated, with, the, earth, and, or, underworld, as, a, chthonic, deity, the, worship, of, hermes, also, included, an, aspect, relating, to, fertility, with, the, phallus, being, included, among, his, major, symbols, the, inclusion, of, phallic, imagery, associated, with, hermes, and, placed, in, the, form, of, herma, at, the, entrances, to, households, may, reflect, a, belief, in, ancient, times, that, hermes, was, a, symbol, of, the, household, s, fertility, specifically, the, potency, of, the, male, head, of, the, household, in, producing, children, the, association, between, hermes, and, the, underworld, is, related, to, his, function, as, a, god, of, boundaries, the, boundary, between, life, and, death, but, he, is, considered, a, psychopomp, a, deity, who, helps, guide, souls, of, the, deceased, to, the, afterlife, and, his, image, was, commonly, depicted, on, gravestones, in, classical, greece, in, ancient, greece, hermes, was, a, phallic, god, of, boundaries, his, name, in, the, form, herma, was, applied, to, a, wayside, marker, pile, of, stones, and, each, traveler, added, a, stone, to, the, pile, in, the, 6th, century, bc, hipparchus, the, son, of, pisistratus, replaced, the, cairns, that, marked, the, midway, point, between, each, village, deme, at, the, central, agora, of, athens, with, a, square, or, rectangular, pillar, of, stone, or, bronze, topped, by, a, bust, of, a, bearded, hermes, an, erect, phallus, rose, from, the, base, in, the, more, primitive, mount, kyllini, or, cyllenian, herms, the, standing, stone, or, wooden, pillar, was, simply, a, carved, phallus, that, a, monument, of, this, kind, could, be, transformed, into, an, olympian, god, is, astounding, walter, burkert, remarked, in, athens, herms, were, placed, outside, houses, both, as, a, form, of, protection, for, the, home, a, symbol, of, male, fertility, and, as, a, link, between, the, household, and, its, gods, with, the, gods, of, the, wider, community, in, 415, bc, on, the, night, when, the, athenian, fleet, was, about, to, set, sail, for, syracuse, during, the, peloponnesian, war, all, of, the, athenian, hermai, were, vandalized, the, athenians, at, the, time, believed, it, was, the, work, of, saboteurs, either, from, syracuse, or, from, the, anti, war, faction, within, athens, itself, socrates, pupil, alcibiades, was, suspected, of, involvement, and, one, of, the, charges, eventually, made, against, socrates, which, led, to, his, execution, 16, years, later, was, that, he, had, either, corrupted, alcibiades, or, failed, to, guide, him, away, from, his, moral, corruption, in, association, with, his, role, as, a, psychopomp, and, god, who, is, able, to, easily, cross, boundaries, hermes, is, predominantly, worshiped, as, a, messenger, often, described, as, the, messenger, of, the, gods, since, he, can, convey, messages, between, the, divine, realms, the, underworld, and, the, world, of, mortals, as, a, messenger, and, divine, herald, he, wears, winged, sandals, or, in, roman, art, influenced, by, etruscan, depictions, of, turms, a, winged, cap, hermes, was, known, as, the, patron, god, of, flocks, herds, and, shepherds, an, attribute, possibly, tied, to, his, early, origin, as, an, aspect, of, pan, in, boeotia, hermes, was, worshiped, for, having, saved, the, town, from, a, plague, by, carrying, a, ram, or, calf, around, the, city, walls, a, yearly, festival, commemorated, this, event, during, which, a, lamb, would, be, carried, around, the, city, by, the, most, handsome, boy, and, then, sacrificed, in, order, to, purify, and, protect, the, city, from, disease, drought, and, famine, numerous, depictions, of, hermes, as, a, shepherd, god, carrying, a, lamb, on, his, shoulders, hermes, kriophoros, have, been, found, throughout, the, mediterranean, world, and, it, is, possible, that, the, iconography, of, hermes, as, the, good, shepherd, had, an, influence, on, early, christianity, specifically, in, the, description, of, christ, as, the, good, shepherd, in, the, gospel, of, john, the, earliest, written, record, of, hermes, comes, from, linear, b, inscriptions, from, pylos, thebes, and, knossos, dating, to, the, bronze, age, mycenaean, period, here, hermes, name, is, rendered, as, e, ma, a, h, this, name, is, always, recorded, alongside, those, of, several, goddesses, including, potnija, posidaeja, diwja, hera, pere, and, ipemedeja, indicating, that, his, worship, was, strongly, connected, to, theirs, this, is, a, pattern, that, would, continue, in, later, periods, as, worship, of, hermes, almost, always, took, place, within, temples, and, sanctuaries, primarily, dedicated, to, goddesses, including, hera, demeter, hecate, and, despoina, in, literary, works, of, archaic, greece, hermes, is, depicted, both, as, a, protector, and, a, trickster, in, homer, s, iliad, hermes, is, called, the, bringer, of, good, luck, guide, and, guardian, and, excellent, in, all, the, tricks, in, hesiod, s, works, and, days, hermes, is, depicted, giving, pandora, the, gifts, of, lies, seductive, words, and, a, dubious, character, the, earliest, known, theological, or, spiritual, documents, concerning, hermes, are, found, in, the, c, 7th, century, bc, homeric, hymns, in, homeric, hymn, 4, to, hermes, describes, the, god, s, birth, and, his, theft, of, apollo, s, sacred, cattle, in, this, hymn, hermes, is, invoked, as, a, god, of, many, shifts, polytropos, associated, with, cunning, and, thievery, but, also, a, bringer, of, dreams, and, a, night, guardian, he, is, said, to, have, invented, the, chelys, lyre, as, well, as, racing, and, the, sport, of, wrestling, the, cult, of, hermes, flourished, in, attica, and, many, scholars, writing, before, the, discovery, of, the, linear, b, evidence, considered, hermes, to, be, a, uniquely, athenian, god, this, region, had, numerous, hermai, or, pillar, like, icons, dedicated, to, the, god, marking, boundaries, crossroads, and, entryways, these, were, initially, stone, piles, later, pillars, made, of, wood, stone, or, bronze, with, carved, images, of, hermes, a, phallus, or, both, in, the, context, of, these, herms, by, the, classical, period, hermes, had, come, to, be, worshiped, as, the, patron, god, of, travelers, and, sailors, by, the, 5th, century, bc, hermai, were, also, in, common, use, as, grave, monuments, emphasizing, hermes, role, as, a, chthonic, deity, and, psychopomp, this, was, probably, his, original, function, and, he, may, have, been, a, late, inclusion, in, the, olympic, pantheon, hermes, is, described, as, the, youngest, olympian, and, some, myths, including, his, theft, of, apollo, s, cows, describe, his, initial, coming, into, contact, with, celestial, deities, hermes, therefore, came, to, be, worshiped, as, a, mediator, between, celestial, and, chthonic, realms, as, well, as, the, one, who, facilitates, interactions, between, mortals, and, the, divine, often, being, depicted, on, libation, vessels, due, to, his, mobility, and, his, liminal, nature, mediating, between, opposites, such, as, merchant, customer, he, was, considered, the, god, of, commerce, and, social, intercourse, the, wealth, brought, in, business, especially, sudden, or, unexpected, enrichment, travel, roads, and, crossroads, borders, and, boundary, conditions, or, transient, the, changes, from, the, threshold, agreements, and, contracts, friendship, hospitality, sexual, intercourse, games, data, the, draw, good, luck, the, sacrifices, and, the, sacrificial, animals, flocks, and, shepherds, and, the, fertility, of, land, and, cattle, in, athens, hermes, eion, came, to, represent, the, athenian, naval, superiority, in, their, defeat, of, the, persians, under, the, command, of, cimon, in, 475, bc, in, this, context, hermes, became, a, god, associated, with, the, athenian, empire, and, its, expansion, and, of, democracy, itself, as, well, as, all, of, those, closely, associated, with, it, from, the, sailors, in, the, navy, to, the, merchants, who, drove, the, economy, a, section, of, the, agora, in, athens, became, known, as, the, hermai, because, it, was, filled, with, a, large, number, of, herms, placed, there, as, votive, offerings, by, merchants, and, others, who, wished, to, commemorate, a, personal, success, in, commerce, or, other, public, affair, the, hermai, was, probably, destroyed, in, the, siege, of, athens, and, piraeus, 87, 86, bc, there, was, a, popular, now, lost, play, by, the, tragedian, astydamas, with, hermes, as, the, primary, subject, as, greek, culture, and, influence, spread, following, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, a, period, of, syncretism, or, interpretatio, graeca, saw, many, traditional, greek, deities, identified, with, foreign, counterparts, in, ptolemaic, egypt, for, example, the, egyptian, god, thoth, was, identified, by, greek, speakers, as, the, egyptian, form, of, hermes, the, two, gods, were, worshiped, as, one, at, the, temple, of, thoth, in, khemenu, a, city, which, became, known, in, greek, as, hermopolis, this, led, to, hermes, gaining, the, attributes, of, a, god, of, translation, and, interpretation, or, more, generally, a, god, of, knowledge, and, learning, this, is, illustrated, by, a, 3rd, century, bc, example, of, a, letter, sent, by, the, priest, petosiris, to, king, nechopso, probably, written, in, alexandria, c, 150, bc, stating, that, hermes, is, the, teacher, of, all, secret, wisdoms, which, are, accessible, by, the, experience, of, religious, ecstasy, an, epithet, of, thoth, found, in, the, temple, at, esna, thoth, the, great, the, great, the, great, became, applied, to, hermes, beginning, in, at, least, 172, bc, this, lent, hermes, one, of, his, most, famous, later, titles, hermes, trismegistus, thrice, greatest, hermes, the, figure, of, hermes, trismegistus, would, later, absorb, a, variety, of, other, esoteric, wisdom, traditions, and, become, a, major, component, of, hermeticism, alchemy, and, related, traditions, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, bc, romans, had, adopted, hermes, into, their, own, religion, combining, his, attributes, and, worship, with, the, earlier, etruscan, god, turms, under, the, name, mercury, according, to, st, augustin, the, latin, name, mercury, may, be, a, title, derived, from, medio, currens, in, reference, to, hermes, role, as, a, mediator, and, messenger, who, moves, between, worlds, mercury, became, one, of, the, most, popular, roman, gods, as, attested, by, the, numerous, shrines, and, depictions, in, artwork, found, in, pompeii, in, art, the, roman, mercury, continued, the, style, of, depictions, found, in, earlier, representations, of, both, hermes, and, turms, a, young, beardless, god, with, winged, shoes, and, or, hat, carrying, the, caduceus, his, role, as, a, god, of, boundaries, a, messenger, and, a, psychopomp, also, remained, unchanged, following, his, adoption, into, the, roman, religion, these, attributes, were, also, similar, to, those, in, the, etruscan, s, worship, of, turms, the, romans, identified, the, germanic, god, odin, with, mercury, and, there, is, evidence, that, germanic, peoples, who, had, contact, with, roman, culture, also, accepted, this, identification, odin, and, mercury, hermes, share, several, attributes, in, common, for, example, both, are, depicted, carrying, a, staff, and, wearing, a, wide, brimmed, hat, and, both, are, travelers, or, wanderers, however, the, reasons, for, this, interpretation, appear, to, go, beyond, superficial, similarities, both, gods, are, connected, to, the, dead, mercury, as, psychopomp, and, odin, as, lord, of, the, dead, in, valhalla, both, were, connected, to, eloquent, speech, and, both, were, associated, with, secret, knowledge, the, identification, of, odin, as, mercury, was, probably, also, influenced, by, a, previous, association, of, a, more, odin, like, celtic, god, as, the, celtic, mercurius, a, further, roman, imperial, era, syncretism, came, in, the, form, of, hermanubis, the, result, of, the, identification, of, hermes, with, the, egyptian, god, of, the, dead, anubis, hermes, and, anubis, were, both, psychopomps, the, primary, attribute, leading, to, their, conflation, as, the, same, god, hermanubis, depicted, with, a, human, body, and, a, jackal, head, holding, the, caduceus, in, addition, to, his, function, of, guiding, souls, to, the, afterlife, hermanubis, represented, the, egyptian, priesthood, the, investigation, of, truth, beginning, around, the, turn, of, the, 1st, century, ad, a, process, began, by, which, in, certain, traditions, hermes, became, euhemerised, that, is, interpreted, as, a, historical, mortal, figure, who, had, become, divine, or, elevated, to, godlike, status, in, legend, numerous, books, of, wisdom, and, magic, including, astrology, theosophy, and, alchemy, were, attributed, to, this, historical, hermes, usually, identified, in, his, alexandrian, form, of, hermes, trismegistus, as, a, collection, these, works, are, referred, to, as, the, hermetica, though, worship, of, hermes, had, been, almost, fully, suppressed, in, the, roman, empire, following, the, christian, persecution, of, paganism, under, theodosius, i, in, the, 4th, century, ad, hermes, continued, to, be, recognized, as, a, mystical, or, prophetic, figure, though, a, mortal, one, by, christian, scholars, early, medieval, christians, such, as, augustine, believed, that, a, euhemerised, hermes, trismegistus, had, been, an, ancient, pagan, prophet, who, predicted, the, emergence, of, christianity, in, his, writings, some, christian, philosophers, in, the, medieval, and, renaissance, periods, believed, in, the, existence, of, a, prisca, theologia, a, single, thread, of, true, theology, that, could, be, found, uniting, all, religions, christian, philosophers, used, hermetic, writings, and, other, ancient, philosophical, literature, to, support, their, belief, in, the, prisca, theologia, arguing, that, hermes, trismegistus, was, a, contemporary, of, moses, or, that, he, was, the, third, in, a, line, of, important, prophets, after, enoch, and, noah, the, 10th, century, suda, attempted, to, further, christianize, the, figure, of, hermes, claiming, that, he, was, called, trismegistus, on, account, of, his, praise, of, the, trinity, saying, there, is, one, divine, nature, in, the, trinity, there, are, only, three, temples, known, to, have, been, specifically, dedicated, to, hermes, during, the, classical, greek, period, all, of, them, in, arcadia, though, there, are, a, few, references, in, ancient, literature, to, numerous, temples, of, hermes, this, may, be, poetic, license, describing, the, ubiquitous, herms, or, other, smaller, shrines, to, hermes, located, in, the, temples, of, other, deities, one, of, the, oldest, places, of, worship, for, hermes, was, mount, cyllene, in, arcadia, where, some, myths, say, he, was, born, tradition, holds, that, his, first, temple, was, built, by, lycaon, from, there, the, hermes, cult, would, have, been, taken, to, athens, from, which, it, radiated, to, the, whole, of, greece, in, the, roman, period, additional, temples, to, hermes, mercury, were, constructed, across, the, empire, including, several, in, modern, day, tunisia, mercury, s, temple, in, rome, was, situated, in, the, circus, maximus, between, the, aventine, and, palatine, hills, and, was, built, in, 495, bc, in, most, places, temples, were, consecrated, to, hermes, in, conjunction, with, aphrodite, as, in, attica, arcadia, crete, samos, and, in, magna, graecia, several, ex, votos, found, in, his, temples, revealed, his, role, as, initiator, of, young, adulthood, among, them, soldiers, and, hunters, since, war, and, certain, forms, of, hunting, were, seen, as, ceremonial, initiatory, ordeals, this, function, of, hermes, explains, why, some, images, in, temples, and, other, vessels, show, him, as, a, teenager, as, a, patron, of, the, gym, and, fighting, hermes, had, statues, in, gyms, and, he, was, also, worshiped, in, the, sanctuary, of, the, twelve, gods, in, olympia, where, greeks, celebrated, the, olympic, games, his, statue, was, held, there, on, an, altar, dedicated, to, him, and, apollo, together, a, temple, within, the, aventine, was, consecrated, in, 495, bc, pausanias, wrote, that, during, his, time, at, megalopolis, people, could, see, the, ruins, of, the, temple, of, hermes, acacesius, in, addition, the, tricrena, meaning, three, springs, mountains, at, pheneus, were, sacred, to, hermes, because, three, springs, were, there, and, according, to, the, legend, hermes, was, washed, in, them, after, birth, by, the, nymphs, of, the, mountain, furthermore,
