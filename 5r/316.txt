new, age, is, a, range, of, spiritual, or, religious, practices, and, beliefs, which, rapidly, grew, in, western, society, during, the, early, 1970s, its, highly, eclectic, and, unsystematic, structure, makes, a, precise, definition, difficult, although, many, scholars, consider, it, a, religious, movement, its, adherents, typically, see, it, as, spiritual, or, as, unifying, mind, body, spirit, and, rarely, use, the, term, new, age, themselves, scholars, often, call, it, the, new, age, movement, although, others, contest, this, term, and, suggest, it, is, better, seen, as, a, milieu, or, zeitgeist, as, a, form, of, western, esotericism, the, new, age, drew, heavily, upon, esoteric, traditions, such, as, the, occultism, of, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, including, the, work, of, emanuel, swedenborg, and, franz, mesmer, as, well, as, spiritualism, new, thought, and, theosophy, more, immediately, it, arose, from, mid, twentieth, century, influences, such, as, the, ufo, religions, of, the, 1950s, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, and, the, human, potential, movement, its, exact, origins, remain, contested, but, it, became, a, major, movement, in, the, 1970s, at, which, time, it, was, centered, largely, in, the, united, kingdom, it, expanded, widely, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, particular, in, the, united, states, by, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, the, term, new, age, was, increasingly, rejected, within, this, milieu, with, some, scholars, arguing, that, the, new, age, phenomenon, had, ended, despite, its, eclectic, nature, the, new, age, has, several, main, currents, theologically, the, new, age, typically, accepts, a, holistic, form, of, divinity, that, pervades, the, universe, including, human, beings, themselves, leading, to, a, strong, emphasis, on, the, spiritual, authority, of, the, self, this, is, accompanied, by, a, common, belief, in, a, variety, of, semi, divine, non, human, entities, such, as, angels, with, whom, humans, can, communicate, particularly, by, channeling, through, a, human, intermediary, typically, viewing, history, as, divided, into, spiritual, ages, a, common, new, age, belief, is, in, a, forgotten, age, of, great, technological, advancement, and, spiritual, wisdom, declining, into, periods, of, increasing, violence, and, spiritual, degeneracy, which, will, now, be, remedied, by, the, emergence, of, an, age, of, aquarius, from, which, the, milieu, gets, its, name, there, is, also, a, strong, focus, on, healing, particularly, using, forms, of, alternative, medicine, and, an, emphasis, on, unifying, science, with, spirituality, the, dedication, of, new, agers, varied, considerably, from, those, who, adopted, a, number, of, new, age, ideas, and, practices, to, those, who, fully, embraced, and, dedicated, their, lives, to, it, the, new, age, has, generated, criticism, from, christians, as, well, as, modern, pagan, and, indigenous, communities, from, the, 1990s, onward, the, new, age, became, the, subject, of, research, by, academic, scholars, of, religious, studies, one, of, the, few, things, on, which, all, scholars, agree, concerning, new, age, is, that, it, is, difficult, to, define, often, the, definition, given, actually, reflects, the, background, of, the, scholar, giving, the, definition, thus, the, new, ager, views, new, age, as, a, revolutionary, period, of, history, dictated, by, the, stars, the, christian, apologist, has, often, defined, new, age, as, a, cult, the, historian, of, ideas, understands, it, as, a, manifestation, of, the, perennial, tradition, the, philosopher, sees, new, age, as, a, monistic, or, holistic, worldview, the, sociologist, describes, new, age, as, a, new, religious, movement, nrm, while, the, psychologist, describes, it, as, a, form, of, narcissism, scholar, of, religion, daren, kemp, 2004, the, new, age, phenomenon, has, proved, difficult, to, define, with, much, scholarly, disagreement, as, to, its, scope, the, scholars, steven, j, sutcliffe, and, ingvild, s, lid, gilhus, have, even, suggested, that, it, remains, among, the, most, disputed, of, categories, in, the, study, of, religion, the, scholar, of, religion, paul, heelas, characterised, the, new, age, as, an, eclectic, hotch, potch, of, beliefs, practices, and, ways, of, life, that, can, be, identified, as, a, singular, phenomenon, through, their, use, of, the, same, or, very, similar, lingua, franca, to, do, with, the, human, and, planetary, condition, and, how, it, can, be, transformed, similarly, the, historian, of, religion, olav, hammer, termed, it, a, common, denominator, for, a, variety, of, quite, divergent, contemporary, popular, practices, and, beliefs, that, have, emerged, since, the, late, 1970s, and, are, largely, united, by, historical, links, a, shared, discourse, and, an, air, de, famille, according, to, hammer, this, new, age, was, a, fluid, and, fuzzy, cultic, milieu, the, sociologist, of, religion, michael, york, described, the, new, age, as, an, umbrella, term, that, includes, a, great, variety, of, groups, and, identities, that, are, united, by, their, expectation, of, a, major, and, universal, change, being, primarily, founded, on, the, individual, and, collective, development, of, human, potential, the, scholar, of, religion, wouter, hanegraaff, adopted, a, different, approach, by, asserting, that, new, age, was, a, label, attached, indiscriminately, to, whatever, seems, to, fit, it, and, that, as, a, result, it, means, very, different, things, to, different, people, he, thus, argued, against, the, idea, that, the, new, age, could, be, considered, a, unified, ideology, or, weltanschauung, although, he, believed, that, it, could, be, considered, a, more, or, less, unified, movement, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, new, age, is, too, diverse, to, be, a, singular, movement, the, scholar, of, religion, george, d, chryssides, called, it, a, counter, cultural, zeitgeist, while, the, sociologist, of, religion, steven, bruce, suggested, that, new, age, was, a, milieu, heelas, and, scholar, of, religion, linda, woodhead, called, it, the, holistic, milieu, there, is, no, central, authority, within, the, new, age, phenomenon, that, can, determine, what, counts, as, new, age, and, what, does, not, many, of, those, groups, and, individuals, who, could, analytically, be, categorised, as, part, of, the, new, age, reject, the, term, new, age, in, reference, to, themselves, some, even, express, active, hostility, to, the, term, rather, than, terming, themselves, new, agers, those, involved, in, this, milieu, commonly, describe, themselves, as, spiritual, seekers, and, some, self, identify, as, a, member, of, a, different, religious, group, such, as, christianity, judaism, or, buddhism, in, 2003, sutcliffe, observed, that, the, use, of, the, term, new, age, was, optional, episodic, and, declining, overall, adding, that, among, the, very, few, individuals, who, did, use, it, they, usually, did, so, with, qualification, for, instance, by, placing, it, in, quotation, marks, other, academics, such, as, sara, mackian, have, argued, that, the, sheer, diversity, of, the, new, age, renders, the, term, too, problematic, for, scholars, to, use, mackian, proposed, everyday, spirituality, as, an, alternate, term, while, acknowledging, that, new, age, was, a, problematic, term, the, scholar, of, religion, james, r, lewis, stated, that, it, remained, a, useful, etic, category, for, scholars, to, use, because, there, exists, no, comparable, term, which, covers, all, aspects, of, the, movement, similarly, chryssides, argued, that, the, fact, that, new, age, is, a, theoretical, concept, does, not, undermine, its, usefulness, or, employability, he, drew, comparisons, with, hinduism, a, similar, western, etic, piece, of, vocabulary, that, scholars, of, religion, used, despite, its, problems, in, discussing, the, new, age, academics, have, varyingly, referred, to, new, age, spirituality, and, new, age, religion, those, involved, in, the, new, age, rarely, consider, it, to, be, religion, negatively, associating, that, term, solely, with, organized, religion, and, instead, describe, their, practices, as, spirituality, religious, studies, scholars, however, have, repeatedly, referred, to, the, new, age, milieu, as, a, religion, york, described, the, new, age, as, a, new, religious, movement, nrm, conversely, both, heelas, and, sutcliffe, rejected, this, categorisation, heelas, believed, that, while, elements, of, the, new, age, represented, nrms, this, did, not, apply, to, every, new, age, group, similarly, chryssides, stated, that, the, new, age, could, not, be, seen, as, a, religion, in, itself, the, new, age, movement, is, the, cultic, milieu, having, become, conscious, of, itself, in, the, later, 1970s, as, constituting, a, more, or, less, unified, movement, all, manifestations, of, this, movement, are, characterized, by, a, popular, western, culture, criticism, expressed, in, terms, of, a, secularized, esotericism, scholar, of, esotericism, wouter, hanegraaff, 1996, the, new, age, is, also, a, form, of, western, esotericism, hanegraaff, regarded, the, new, age, as, a, form, of, popular, culture, criticism, in, that, it, represented, a, reaction, against, the, dominant, western, values, of, judeo, christian, religion, and, rationalism, adding, that, new, age, religion, formulates, such, criticism, not, at, random, but, falls, back, on, the, ideas, of, earlier, western, esoteric, groups, the, new, age, has, also, been, identified, by, various, scholars, of, religion, as, part, of, the, cultic, milieu, this, concept, developed, by, the, sociologist, colin, campbell, refers, to, a, social, network, of, marginalized, ideas, through, their, shared, marginalization, within, a, given, society, these, disparate, ideas, interact, and, create, new, syntheses, hammer, identified, much, of, the, new, age, as, corresponding, to, the, concept, of, folk, religions, in, that, it, seeks, to, deal, with, existential, questions, regarding, subjects, like, death, and, disease, in, an, unsystematic, fashion, often, through, a, process, of, bricolage, from, already, available, narratives, and, rituals, york, also, heuristically, divides, the, new, age, into, three, broad, trends, the, first, the, social, camp, represents, groups, that, primarily, seek, to, bring, about, social, change, while, the, second, the, occult, camp, instead, focus, on, contact, with, spirit, entities, and, channeling, york, s, third, group, the, spiritual, camp, represents, a, middle, ground, between, these, two, camps, that, focuses, largely, on, individual, development, the, term, new, age, along, with, related, terms, like, new, era, and, new, world, long, predate, the, emergence, of, the, new, age, movement, and, have, widely, been, used, to, assert, that, a, better, way, of, life, for, humanity, is, dawning, it, occurs, commonly, for, instance, in, political, contexts, the, great, seal, of, the, united, states, designed, in, 1782, proclaims, a, new, order, of, ages, while, in, the, 1980s, the, soviet, general, secretary, mikhail, gorbachev, proclaimed, that, all, mankind, is, entering, a, new, age, the, term, has, also, appeared, within, western, esoteric, schools, of, thought, having, a, scattered, use, from, the, mid, nineteenth, century, onward, in, 1864, the, american, swedenborgian, warren, felt, evans, published, the, new, age, and, its, message, while, in, 1907, alfred, orage, and, holbrook, jackson, began, editing, a, weekly, journal, of, christian, liberalism, and, socialism, titled, the, new, age, the, concept, of, a, coming, new, age, that, would, be, inaugurated, by, the, return, to, earth, of, jesus, christ, was, a, theme, in, the, poetry, of, wellesley, tudor, pole, 1884, 1968, and, of, johanna, brandt, 1876, 1964, and, then, also, appeared, in, the, work, of, the, british, born, american, theosophist, alice, bailey, 1880, 1949, featuring, in, titles, such, as, discipleship, in, the, new, age, 1944, and, education, in, the, new, age, 1954, between, the, 1930s, and, 1960s, a, small, number, of, groups, and, individuals, became, preoccupied, with, the, concept, of, a, coming, new, age, and, used, the, term, accordingly, the, term, had, thus, become, a, recurring, motif, in, the, esoteric, spirituality, milieu, sutcliffe, therefore, expressed, the, view, that, while, the, term, new, age, had, originally, been, an, apocalyptic, emblem, it, would, only, be, later, that, it, became, a, tag, or, codeword, for, a, spiritual, idiom, according, to, scholar, nevill, drury, the, new, age, has, a, tangible, history, although, hanegraaff, expressed, the, view, that, most, new, agers, were, surprisingly, ignorant, about, the, actual, historical, roots, of, their, beliefs, similarly, hammer, thought, that, source, amnesia, was, a, building, block, of, a, new, age, worldview, with, new, agers, typically, adopting, ideas, with, no, awareness, of, where, those, ideas, originated, as, a, form, of, western, esotericism, the, new, age, has, antecedents, that, stretch, back, to, southern, europe, in, late, antiquity, following, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, 18th, century, europe, new, esoteric, ideas, developed, in, response, to, the, development, of, scientific, rationality, scholars, call, this, new, esoteric, trend, occultism, and, this, occultism, was, a, key, factor, in, the, development, of, the, worldview, from, which, the, new, age, emerged, one, of, the, earliest, influences, on, the, new, age, was, the, swedish, 18th, century, christian, mystic, emanuel, swedenborg, who, professed, the, ability, to, communicate, with, angels, demons, and, spirits, swedenborg, s, attempt, to, unite, science, and, religion, and, his, prediction, of, a, coming, era, in, particular, have, been, cited, as, ways, that, he, prefigured, the, new, age, another, early, influence, was, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, german, physician, and, hypnotist, franz, mesmer, who, wrote, about, the, existence, of, a, force, known, as, animal, magnetism, running, through, the, human, body, the, establishment, of, spiritualism, an, occult, religion, influenced, by, both, swedenborgianism, and, mesmerism, in, the, u, s, during, the, 1840s, has, also, been, identified, as, a, precursor, to, the, new, age, in, particular, through, its, rejection, of, established, christianity, representing, itself, as, a, scientific, approach, to, religion, and, its, emphasis, on, channeling, spirit, entities, most, of, the, beliefs, which, characterise, the, new, age, were, already, present, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, even, to, such, an, extent, that, one, may, legitimately, wonder, whether, the, new, age, brings, anything, new, at, all, historian, of, religion, wouter, hanegraaff, 1996, a, further, major, influence, on, the, new, age, was, the, theosophical, society, an, occult, group, co, founded, by, the, russian, helena, blavatsky, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, her, books, isis, unveiled, 1877, and, the, secret, doctrine, 1888, blavatsky, wrote, that, her, society, was, conveying, the, essence, of, all, world, religions, and, it, thus, emphasized, a, focus, on, comparative, religion, serving, as, a, partial, bridge, between, theosophical, ideas, and, those, of, the, new, age, was, the, american, esotericist, edgar, cayce, who, founded, the, association, for, research, and, enlightenment, another, partial, bridge, was, the, danish, mystic, martinus, who, is, popular, in, scandinavia, another, influence, was, new, thought, which, developed, in, late, nineteenth, century, new, england, as, a, christian, oriented, healing, movement, before, spreading, throughout, the, united, states, another, influence, was, the, psychologist, carl, jung, drury, also, identified, as, an, important, influence, upon, the, new, age, the, indian, swami, vivekananda, an, adherent, of, the, philosophy, of, vedanta, who, first, brought, hinduism, to, the, west, in, the, late, 19th, century, hanegraaff, believed, that, the, new, age, s, direct, antecedents, could, be, found, in, the, ufo, religions, of, the, 1950s, which, he, termed, a, proto, new, age, movement, many, of, these, new, religious, movements, had, strong, apocalyptic, beliefs, regarding, a, coming, new, age, which, they, typically, asserted, would, be, brought, about, by, contact, with, extraterrestrials, examples, of, such, groups, included, the, aetherius, society, founded, in, the, uk, in, 1955, and, the, heralds, of, the, new, age, established, in, new, zealand, in, 1956, from, a, historical, perspective, the, new, age, phenomenon, is, most, associated, with, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, according, to, author, andrew, grant, jackson, george, harrison, s, adoption, of, hindu, philosophy, and, indian, instrumentation, in, his, songs, with, the, beatles, in, the, mid, 1960s, together, with, the, band, s, highly, publicised, study, of, transcendental, meditation, truly, kick, started, the, human, potential, movement, that, subsequently, became, new, age, although, not, common, throughout, the, counterculture, usage, of, the, terms, new, age, and, age, of, aquarius, used, in, reference, to, a, coming, era, were, found, within, it, for, instance, appearing, on, adverts, for, the, woodstock, festival, of, 1969, and, in, the, lyrics, of, aquarius, the, opening, song, of, the, 1967, musical, hair, the, american, tribal, love, rock, musical, this, decade, also, witnessed, the, emergence, of, a, variety, of, new, religious, movements, and, newly, established, religions, in, the, united, states, creating, a, spiritual, milieu, from, which, the, new, age, drew, upon, these, included, the, san, francisco, zen, center, transcendental, meditation, soka, gakkai, the, inner, peace, movement, the, church, of, all, worlds, and, the, church, of, satan, although, there, had, been, an, established, interest, in, asian, religious, ideas, in, the, u, s, from, at, least, the, eighteenth, century, many, of, these, new, developments, were, variants, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, sufism, which, had, been, imported, to, the, west, from, asia, following, the, u, s, government, s, decision, to, rescind, the, asian, exclusion, act, in, 1965, in, 1962, the, esalen, institute, was, established, in, big, sur, california, esalen, and, similar, personal, growth, centers, had, developed, links, to, humanistic, psychology, and, from, this, the, human, potential, movement, emerged, and, strongly, influenced, the, new, age, in, britain, a, number, of, small, religious, groups, that, came, to, be, identified, as, the, light, movement, had, begun, declaring, the, existence, of, a, coming, new, age, influenced, strongly, by, the, theosophical, ideas, of, blavatsky, and, bailey, the, most, prominent, of, these, groups, was, the, findhorn, foundation, which, founded, the, findhorn, ecovillage, in, the, scottish, area, of, findhorn, moray, in, 1962, although, its, founders, were, from, an, older, generation, findhorn, attracted, increasing, numbers, of, countercultural, baby, boomers, during, the, 1960s, to, the, extent, that, its, population, had, grown, sixfold, to, c, 120, residents, by, 1972, in, october, 1965, the, co, founder, of, findhorn, foundation, peter, caddy, a, former, member, of, the, occult, rosicrucian, order, crotona, fellowship, attended, a, meeting, of, various, figures, within, britain, s, esoteric, milieu, advertised, as, the, significance, of, the, group, in, the, new, age, it, was, held, at, attingham, park, over, the, course, of, a, weekend, all, of, these, groups, created, the, backdrop, from, which, the, new, age, movement, emerged, as, james, r, lewis, and, j, gordon, melton, point, out, the, new, age, phenomenon, represents, a, synthesis, of, many, different, preexisting, movements, and, strands, of, thought, nevertheless, york, asserted, that, while, the, new, age, bore, many, similarities, with, both, earlier, forms, of, western, esotericism, and, asian, religion, it, remained, distinct, from, its, predecessors, in, its, own, self, consciousness, as, a, new, way, of, thinking, the, late, 1950s, saw, the, first, stirrings, within, the, cultic, milieu, of, a, belief, in, a, coming, new, age, a, variety, of, small, movements, arose, revolving, around, revealed, messages, from, beings, in, space, and, presenting, a, synthesis, of, post, theosophical, and, other, esoteric, doctrines, these, movements, might, have, remained, marginal, had, it, not, been, for, the, explosion, of, the, counterculture, in, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, various, historical, threads, began, to, converge, nineteenth, century, doctrinal, elements, such, as, theosophy, and, post, theosophical, esotericism, as, well, as, harmonious, or, positive, thinking, were, now, eclectically, combined, with, religious, psychologies, transpersonal, psychology, jungianism, and, a, variety, of, eastern, teachings, it, became, perfectly, feasible, for, the, same, individuals, to, consult, the, i, ching, practice, jungian, astrology, read, abraham, maslow, s, writings, on, peak, experiences, etc, the, reason, for, the, ready, incorporation, of, such, disparate, sources, was, a, similar, goal, of, exploring, an, individualized, and, largely, non, christian, religiosity, scholar, of, esotericism, olav, hammer, 2001, by, the, early, 1970s, use, of, the, term, new, age, was, increasingly, common, within, the, cultic, milieu, this, was, because, according, to, sutcliffe, the, emblem, of, the, new, age, had, been, passed, from, the, subcultural, pioneers, in, groups, like, findhorn, to, the, wider, array, of, countercultural, baby, boomers, between, c, 1967, and, 1974, he, noted, that, as, this, happened, the, meaning, of, the, term, new, age, changed, whereas, it, had, once, referred, specifically, to, a, coming, era, at, this, point, it, came, to, be, used, in, a, wider, sense, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, spiritual, activities, and, practices, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 1970s, the, new, age, expanded, to, cover, a, wide, variety, of, alternative, spiritual, and, religious, beliefs, and, practices, not, all, of, which, explicitly, held, to, the, belief, in, the, age, of, aquarius, but, were, nevertheless, widely, recognized, as, broadly, similar, in, their, search, for, alternatives, to, mainstream, society, in, doing, so, the, new, age, became, a, banner, under, which, to, bring, together, the, wider, cultic, milieu, of, american, society, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, had, rapidly, declined, by, the, start, of, the, 1970s, in, large, part, due, to, the, collapse, of, the, commune, movement, but, it, would, be, many, former, members, of, the, counter, culture, and, hippie, subculture, who, subsequently, became, early, adherents, of, the, new, age, movement, the, exact, origins, of, the, new, age, movement, remain, an, issue, of, debate, melton, asserted, that, it, emerged, in, the, early, 1970s, whereas, hanegraaff, instead, traced, its, emergence, to, the, latter, 1970s, adding, that, it, then, entered, its, full, development, in, the, 1980s, this, early, form, of, the, movement, was, based, largely, in, britain, and, exhibited, a, strong, influence, from, theosophy, and, anthroposophy, hanegraaff, termed, this, early, core, of, the, movement, the, new, age, sensu, stricto, or, new, age, in, the, strict, sense, hanegraaff, terms, the, broader, development, the, new, age, sensu, lato, or, new, age, in, the, wider, sense, stores, that, came, to, be, known, as, new, age, shops, opened, up, selling, related, books, magazines, jewelry, and, crystals, and, they, were, typified, by, the, playing, of, new, age, music, and, the, smell, of, incense, this, probably, influenced, several, thousand, small, metaphysical, book, and, gift, stores, that, increasingly, defined, themselves, as, new, age, bookstores, while, new, age, titles, came, to, be, increasingly, available, from, mainstream, bookstores, and, then, websites, like, amazon, com, not, everyone, who, came, to, be, associated, with, the, new, age, phenomenon, openly, embraced, the, term, new, age, although, it, was, popularised, in, books, like, david, spangler, s, 1977, work, revelation, the, birth, of, a, new, age, and, mark, satin, s, 1979, book, new, age, politics, healing, self, and, society, marilyn, ferguson, s, 1982, book, the, aquarian, conspiracy, has, also, been, regarded, as, a, landmark, work, in, the, development, of, the, new, age, promoting, the, idea, that, a, new, era, was, emerging, other, terms, that, were, employed, synonymously, with, new, age, in, this, milieu, included, green, holistic, alternative, and, spiritual, 1971, witnessed, the, foundation, of, est, by, werner, h, erhard, a, transformational, training, course, that, became, a, part, of, the, early, movement, melton, suggested, that, the, 1970s, witnessed, the, growth, of, a, relationship, between, the, new, age, movement, and, the, older, new, thought, movement, as, evidenced, by, the, widespread, use, of, helen, schucman, s, a, course, in, miracles, 1975, new, age, music, and, crystal, healing, in, new, thought, churches, some, figures, in, the, new, thought, movement, were, skeptical, challenging, the, compatibility, of, new, age, and, new, thought, perspectives, during, these, decades, findhorn, had, become, a, site, of, pilgrimage, for, many, new, agers, and, greatly, expanded, in, size, as, people, joined, the, community, with, workshops, and, conferences, being, held, there, that, brought, together, new, age, thinkers, from, across, the, world, several, key, events, occurred, which, raised, public, awareness, of, the, new, age, subculture, publication, of, linda, goodman, s, best, selling, astrology, books, sun, signs, 1968, and, love, signs, 1978, the, release, of, shirley, maclaine, s, book, out, on, a, limb, 1983, later, adapted, into, a, television, mini, series, with, the, same, name, 1987, and, the, harmonic, convergence, planetary, alignment, on, august, 16, and, 17, 1987, organized, by, jos, arg, elles, in, sedona, arizona, the, convergence, attracted, more, people, to, the, movement, than, any, other, single, event, heelas, suggested, that, the, movement, was, influenced, by, the, enterprise, culture, encouraged, by, the, u, s, and, u, k, governments, during, the, 1980s, onward, with, its, emphasis, on, initiative, and, self, reliance, resonating, with, any, new, age, ideas, channelers, jane, roberts, seth, material, helen, schucman, a, course, in, miracles, j, z, knight, ramtha, neale, donald, walsch, conversations, with, god, contributed, to, the, movement, s, growth, the, first, significant, exponent, of, the, new, age, movement, in, the, u, s, has, been, cited, as, ram, dass, core, works, in, the, propagating, of, new, age, ideas, included, jane, roberts, s, seth, series, published, from, 1972, onward, helen, schucman, s, 1975, publication, a, course, in, miracles, and, james, redfield, s, 1993, work, the, celestine, prophecy, a, number, of, these, books, became, best, sellers, such, as, the, seth, book, series, which, quickly, sold, over, a, million, copies, supplementing, these, books, were, videos, audiotapes, compact, discs, and, websites, the, development, of, the, internet, in, particular, further, popularized, new, age, ideas, and, made, them, more, widely, accessible, new, age, ideas, influenced, the, development, of, rave, culture, in, the, late, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, britain, during, the, 1980s, the, term, new, age, travellers, came, into, use, although, york, characterised, this, term, as, a, misnomer, created, by, the, media, these, new, age, travellers, had, little, to, do, with, the, new, age, as, the, term, was, used, more, widely, with, scholar, of, religion, daren, kemp, observing, that, new, age, spirituality, is, not, an, essential, part, of, new, age, traveller, culture, although, there, are, similarities, between, the, two, worldviews, the, term, new, age, came, to, be, used, increasingly, widely, by, the, popular, media, in, the, 1990s, by, the, late, 1980s, some, publishers, dropped, the, term, new, age, as, a, marketing, device, in, 1994, the, scholar, of, religion, gordon, j, melton, presented, a, conference, paper, in, which, he, argued, that, given, that, he, knew, of, nobody, describing, their, practices, as, new, age, anymore, the, new, age, had, died, in, 2001, hammer, observed, that, the, term, new, age, had, increasingly, been, rejected, as, either, pejorative, or, meaningless, by, individuals, within, the, western, cultic, milieu, he, also, noted, that, within, this, milieu, it, was, not, being, replaced, by, any, alternative, and, that, as, such, a, sense, of, collective, identity, was, being, lost, other, scholars, disagreed, with, melton, s, idea, in, 2004, daren, kemp, stated, that, new, age, is, still, very, much, alive, hammer, himself, stated, that, the, new, age, movement, may, be, on, the, wane, but, the, wider, new, age, religiosity, shows, no, sign, of, disappearing, mackian, suggested, that, the, new, age, movement, had, been, replaced, by, a, wider, new, age, sentiment, which, had, come, to, pervade, the, socio, cultural, landscape, of, western, countries, its, diffusion, into, the, mainstream, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, adoption, of, new, age, concepts, by, high, profile, figures, u, s, first, lady, nancy, reagan, consulted, an, astrologer, british, princess, diana, visited, spirit, mediums, and, norwegian, princess, m, rtha, louise, established, a, school, devoted, to, communicating, with, angels, new, age, shops, continued, to, operate, although, many, have, been, remarketed, as, mind, body, spirit, in, 2015, the, scholar, of, religion, hugh, urban, argued, that, new, age, spirituality, is, growing, in, the, united, states, and, can, be, expected, to, become, more, visible, according, to, many, recent, surveys, of, religious, affiliation, the, spiritual, but, not, religious, category, is, one, of, the, fastest, growing, trends, in, american, culture, so, the, new, age, attitude, of, spiritual, individualism, and, eclecticism, may, well, be, an, increasingly, visible, one, in, the, decades, to, come, australian, scholar, paul, j, farrelly, in, his, 2017, doctoral, dissertation, at, australian, national, university, argued, that, while, the, term, new, age, may, become, less, popular, in, the, west, it, is, actually, booming, in, taiwan, where, it, is, regarded, as, something, comparatively, new, and, is, being, exported, from, taiwan, to, the, mainland, china, where, it, is, more, or, less, tolerated, by, the, authorities, the, new, age, places, strong, emphasis, on, the, idea, that, the, individual, and, their, own, experiences, are, the, primary, source, of, authority, on, spiritual, matters, it, exhibits, what, heelas, termed, unmediated, individualism, and, reflects, a, world, view, that, is, radically, democratic, it, places, an, emphasis, on, the, freedom, and, autonomy, of, the, individual, this, emphasis, has, led, to, ethical, disagreements, some, new, agers, believe, helping, others, is, beneficial, although, another, view, is, that, doing, so, encourages, dependency, and, conflicts, with, a, reliance, on, the, self, nevertheless, within, the, new, age, there, are, differences, in, the, role, accorded, to, voices, of, authority, outside, of, the, self, hammer, stated, that, a, belief, in, the, existence, of, a, core, or, true, self, is, a, recurring, theme, in, new, age, texts, the, concept, of, personal, growth, is, also, greatly, emphasised, among, new, agers, while, heelas, noted, that, for, participants, spirituality, is, life, itself, new, age, religiosity, is, typified, by, its, eclecticism, generally, believing, that, there, is, no, one, true, way, to, pursue, spirituality, new, agers, develop, their, own, worldview, by, combining, bits, and, pieces, to, form, their, own, individual, mix, seeking, what, drury, called, a, spirituality, without, borders, or, confining, dogmas, the, anthropologist, david, j, hess, noted, that, in, his, experience, a, common, attitude, among, new, agers, was, that, any, alternative, spiritual, path, is, good, because, it, is, spiritual, and, alternative, this, approach, that, has, generated, a, common, jibe, that, new, age, represents, supermarket, spirituality, york, suggested, that, this, eclecticism, stemmed, from, the, new, age, s, origins, within, late, modern, capitalism, with, new, agers, subscribing, to, a, belief, in, a, free, market, of, spiritual, ideas, as, a, parallel, to, a, free, market, in, economics, as, part, of, its, eclecticism, the, new, age, draws, ideas, from, many, different, cultural, and, spiritual, traditions, from, across, the, world, often, legitimising, this, approach, by, reference, to, a, very, vague, claim, about, underlying, global, unity, certain, societies, are, more, usually, chosen, over, others, examples, include, the, ancient, celts, ancient, egyptians, the, essenes, atlanteans, and, ancient, extraterrestrials, as, noted, by, hammer, to, put, it, bluntly, no, significant, spokespersons, within, the, new, age, community, claim, to, represent, ancient, albanian, wisdom, simply, because, beliefs, regarding, ancient, albanians, are, not, part, of, our, cultural, stereotypes, according, to, hess, these, ancient, or, foreign, societies, represent, an, exotic, other, for, new, agers, who, are, predominantly, white, westerners, a, belief, in, divinity, is, integral, to, new, age, ideas, although, understandings, of, this, divinity, vary, new, age, theology, exhibits, an, inclusive, and, universalistic, approach, that, accepts, all, personal, perspectives, on, the, divine, as, equally, valid, this, intentional, vagueness, as, to, the, nature, of, divinity, also, reflects, the, new, age, idea, that, divinity, cannot, be, comprehended, by, the, human, mind, or, language, new, age, literature, nevertheless, displays, recurring, traits, in, its, depiction, of, the, divine, the, first, is, the, idea, that, it, is, holistic, thus, frequently, being, described, with, such, terms, as, an, ocean, of, oneness, infinite, spirit, primal, stream, one, essence, and, universal, principle, a, second, trait, is, the, characterisation, of, divinity, as, mind, consciousness, and, intelligence, while, a, third, is, the, description, of, divinity, as, a, form, of, energy, a, fourth, trait, is, the, characterisation, of, divinity, as, a, life, force, the, essence, of, which, is, creativity, while, a, fifth, is, the, concept, that, divinity, consists, of, love, most, new, age, groups, believe, in, an, ultimate, source, from, which, all, things, originate, which, is, usually, conflated, with, the, divine, various, creation, myths, have, been, articulated, in, new, age, publications, outlining, how, this, ultimate, source, created, the, universe, and, everything, in, it, in, contrast, some, new, agers, emphasize, the, idea, of, a, universal, inter, relatedness, that, is, not, always, emanating, from, a, single, source, the, new, age, worldview, emphasises, holism, and, the, idea, that, everything, in, existence, is, intricately, connected, as, part, of, a, single, whole, in, doing, so, rejecting, both, the, dualism, of, the, christian, division, of, matter, and, spirit, and, the, reductionism, of, cartesian, science, a, number, of, new, agers, have, linked, this, holistic, interpretation, of, the, universe, to, the, gaia, hypothesis, of, james, lovelock, the, idea, of, holistic, divinity, results, in, a, common, new, age, belief, that, humans, themselves, are, divine, in, essence, a, concept, described, using, such, terms, as, droplet, of, divinity, inner, godhead, and, divine, self, influenced, by, theosophical, and, anthroposophical, ideas, regarding, subtle, bodies, a, common, new, age, idea, holds, to, the, existence, of, a, higher, self, that, is, a, part, of, the, human, but, connects, with, the, divine, essence, of, the, universe, and, which, can, advise, the, human, mind, through, intuition, cosmogonical, creation, stories, are, common, in, new, age, sources, with, these, accounts, reflecting, the, movement, s, holistic, framework, by, describing, an, original, primal, oneness, from, which, all, things, in, the, universe, emanated, an, additional, common, theme, is, that, human, souls, once, living, in, a, spiritual, world, then, descended, into, a, world, of, matter, the, new, age, movement, typically, views, the, material, universe, as, a, meaningful, illusion, which, humans, should, try, to, use, constructively, rather, than, focus, on, escaping, into, other, spiritual, realms, this, physical, world, is, hence, seen, as, a, domain, for, learning, and, growth, after, which, the, human, soul, might, pass, on, to, higher, levels, of, existence, there, is, thus, a, widespread, belief, that, reality, is, engaged, in, an, ongoing, process, of, evolution, rather, than, darwinian, evolution, this, is, typically, seen, as, either, a, teleological, evolution, which, assumes, a, process, headed, to, a, specific, goal, or, an, open, ended, creative, evolution, in, the, flood, of, channeled, material, which, has, been, published, or, delivered, to, live, audiences, in, the, last, two, decades, there, is, much, indeed, that, is, trivial, contradictory, and, confusing, the, authors, of, much, of, this, material, make, claims, that, while, not, necessarily, untrue, or, fraudulent, are, difficult, or, impossible, for, the, reader, to, verify, a, number, of, other, channeled, documents, address, issues, more, immediately, relevant, to, the, human, condition, the, best, of, these, writings, are, not, only, coherent, and, plausible, but, eloquently, persuasive, and, sometimes, disarmingly, moving, academic, suzanne, riordan, 1992, a, conduit, in, esoterism, and, spiritual, discourse, is, a, specific, object, person, location, or, process, such, as, engaging, in, a, s, ance, or, entering, a, trance, or, using, psychedelic, medicines, which, allows, a, person, to, connect, or, communicate, with, a, spiritual, realm, metaphysical, energy, or, spiritual, entity, or, vice, versa, the, use, of, such, a, conduit, may, be, entirely, metaphoric, or, symbolic, or, it, may, be, earnestly, believed, to, be, functional, mackian, argued, that, a, central, but, often, overlooked, element, of, the, phenomenon, was, an, emphasis, on, spirit, and, in, particular, participants, desire, for, a, relationship, with, spirit, many, practitioners, in, her, uk, focused, study, described, themselves, as, workers, for, spirit, expressing, the, desire, to, help, people, learn, about, spirit, they, understood, various, material, signs, as, marking, the, presence, of, spirit, for, instance, the, unexpected, appearance, of, a, feather, new, agers, often, call, upon, this, spirit, to, assist, them, in, everyday, situations, for, instance, to, ease, the, traffic, flow, on, their, way, to, work, new, age, literature, often, refers, to, benevolent, non, human, spirit, beings, who, are, interested, in, humanity, s, spiritual, development, these, are, variously, referred, to, as, angels, guardian, angels, personal, guides, masters, teachers, and, contacts, new, age, angelology, is, nevertheless, unsystematic, reflecting, the, idiosyncrasies, of, individual, authors, the, figure, of, jesus, christ, is, often, mentioned, within, new, age, literature, as, a, mediating, principle, between, divinity, and, humanity, as, well, as, an, exemplar, of, a, spiritually, advanced, human, being, although, not, present, in, every, new, age, group, a, core, belief, within, the, milieu, is, in, channeling, this, is, the, idea, that, humans, beings, sometimes, although, not, always, in, a, state, of, trance, can, act, as, a, channel, of, information, from, sources, other, than, their, normal, selves, these, sources, are, varyingly, described, as, being, god, gods, and, goddesses, ascended, masters, spirit, guides, extraterrestrials, angels, devas, historical, figures, the, collective, unconscious, elementals, or, nature, spirits, hanegraaff, described, channeling, as, a, form, of, articulated, revelation, and, identified, four, forms, trance, channeling, automatisms, clairaudient, channeling, and, open, channeling, a, notable, channeler, in, the, early, 1900s, was, rose, edith, kelly, wife, of, the, english, occultist, and, ceremonial, magician, aleister, crowley, 1875, 1947, she, allegedly, channeled, the, voice, of, a, non, physical, entity, named, aiwass, during, their, honeymoon, in, cairo, egypt, 1904, others, purport, to, channel, spirits, from, future, dimensions, ascended, masters, or, in, the, case, of, the, trance, mediums, of, the, brahma, kumaris, god, another, channeler, in, the, early, 1900s, was, edgar, cayce, who, said, that, he, was, able, to, channel, his, higher, self, while, in, a, trance, like, state, in, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, western, mediumship, developed, in, two, different, ways, one, type, involves, clairaudience, in, which, the, medium, is, said, to, hear, spirits, and, relay, what, they, hear, to, their, clients, the, other, is, a, form, of, channeling, in, which, the, channeler, seemingly, goes, into, a, trance, and, purports, to, leave, their, body, allowing, a, spirit, entity, to, borrow, it, and, then, speak, through, them, when, in, a, trance, the, medium, appears, to, enter, into, a, cataleptic, state, although, modern, channelers, may, not, some, channelers, open, the, eyes, when, channeling, and, remain, able, to, walk, and, behave, normally, the, rhythm, and, the, intonation, of, the, voice, may, also, change, completely, examples, of, new, age, channeling, include, jane, roberts, belief, that, she, was, contacted, by, an, entity, called, seth, and, helen, schucman, s, belief, that, she, had, channeled, jesus, christ, the, academic, suzanne, riordan, examined, a, variety, of, these, new, age, channeled, messages, noting, that, they, typically, echoed, each, other, in, tone, and, content, offering, an, analysis, of, the, human, condition, and, giving, instructions, or, advice, for, how, humanity, can, discover, its, true, destiny, for, many, new, agers, these, channeled, messages, rival, the, scriptures, of, the, main, world, religions, as, sources, of, spiritual, authority, although, often, new, agers, describe, historical, religious, revelations, as, forms, of, channeling, as, well, thus, attempting, to, legitimate, and, authenticate, their, own, contemporary, practices, although, the, concept, of, channeling, from, discarnate, spirit, entities, has, links, to, spiritualism, and, psychical, research, the, new, age, does, not, feature, spiritualism, s, emphasis, on, proving, the, existence, of, life, after, death, nor, psychical, research, s, focus, of, testing, mediums, for, consistency, other, new, age, channels, include, new, age, thought, typically, envisions, the, world, as, developing, through, cosmological, cycles, that, can, be, identified, astrologically, it, adopts, this, concept, from, theosophy, although, often, presents, it, in, a, looser, and, more, eclectic, way, than, is, found, in, theosophical, teaching, new, age, literature, often, proposes, that, humanity, once, lived, in, an, age, of, spiritual, wisdom, in, the, writings, of, new, agers, like, edgar, cayce, the, ancient, period, of, spiritual, wisdom, is, associated, with, concepts, of, supremely, advanced, societies, living, on, lost, continents, such, as, atlantis, lemuria, and, mu, as, well, as, the, idea, that, ancient, societies, like, those, of, ancient, egypt, were, far, more, technologically, advanced, than, modern, scholarship, accepts, new, age, literature, often, posits, that, the, ancient, period, of, spiritual, wisdom, gave, way, to, an, age, of, spiritual, decline, sometimes, termed, the, age, of, pisces, although, characterised, as, being, a, negative, period, for, humanity, new, age, literature, views, the, age, of, pisces, as, an, important, learning, experience, for, the, species, hanegraaff, stated, that, new, age, perceptions, of, history, were, extremely, sketchy, in, their, use, of, description, reflecting, little, interest, in, historiography, and, conflating, history, with, myth, he, also, noted, that, they, were, highly, ethnocentric, in, placing, western, civilization, at, the, centre, of, historical, development, a, common, belief, among, the, new, age, is, that, humanity, has, entered, or, is, coming, to, enter, a, new, period, known, as, the, age, of, aquarius, which, melton, has, characterised, as, a, new, age, of, love, joy, peace, abundance, and, harmony, the, golden, age, heretofore, only, dreamed, about, in, accepting, this, belief, in, a, coming, new, age, the, milieu, has, been, described, as, highly, positive, celebratory, utopian, and, has, also, been, cited, as, an, apocalyptic, movement, opinions, about, the, nature, of, the, coming, age, of, aquarius, differ, among, new, agers, there, are, for, instance, differences, in, belief, about, its, commencement, new, age, author, david, spangler, wrote, that, it, began, in, 1967, others, placed, its, beginning, with, the, harmonic, convergence, of, 1987, author, jos, arg, elles, predicted, its, start, in, 2012, and, some, believe, that, it, will, not, begin, until, several, centuries, into, the, third, millennium, there, are, also, differences, in, how, this, new, age, is, envisioned, those, adhering, to, what, hanegraaff, termed, the, moderate, perspective, believed, that, it, would, be, marked, by, an, improvement, to, current, society, which, affected, both, new, age, concerns, through, the, convergence, of, science, and, mysticism, and, the, global, embrace, of, alternative, medicine, to, more, general, concerns, including, an, end, to, violence, crime, and, war, a, healthier, environment, and, international, co, operation, other, new, agers, adopt, a, fully, utopian, vision, believing, that, the, world, will, be, wholly, transformed, into, an, age, of, light, with, humans, evolving, into, totally, spiritual, beings, and, experiencing, unlimited, love, bliss, and, happiness, rather, than, conceiving, of, the, age, of, aquarius, as, an, indefinite, period, many, believe, that, it, would, last, for, around, two, thousand, years, before, being, replaced, by, a, further, age, there, are, various, beliefs, within, the, milieu, as, to, how, this, new, age, will, come, about, but, most, emphasise, the, idea, that, it, will, be, established, through, human, agency, others, assert, that, it, will, be, established, with, the, aid, of, non, human, forces, such, as, spirits, or, extraterrestrials, ferguson, for, instance, said, that, there, was, a, vanguard, of, humans, known, as, the, aquarian, conspiracy, who, were, helping, to, bring, the, age, of, aquarius, forth, through, their, actions, participants, in, the, new, age, typically, express, the, view, that, their, own, spiritual, actions, are, helping, to, bring, about, the, age, of, aquarius, with, writers, like, ferguson, and, arg, elles, presenting, themselves, as, prophets, ushering, forth, this, future, era, another, recurring, element, of, new, age, is, an, emphasis, on, healing, and, alternative, medicine, the, general, new, age, ethos, is, that, health, is, the, natural, state, for, the, human, being, and, that, illness, is, a, disruption, of, that, natural, balance, hence, new, age, therapies, seek, to, heal, illness, as, a, general, concept, that, includes, physical, mental, and, spiritual, aspects, in, doing, so, it, critiques, mainstream, western, medicine, for, simply, attempting, to, cure, disease, and, thus, has, an, affinity, with, most, forms, of, traditional, medicine, its, focus, of, self, spirituality, has, led, to, the, emphasis, of, self, healing, although, also, present, are, ideas, on, healing, both, others, and, the, earth, itself, the, healing, elements, of, the, movement, are, difficult, to, classify, given, that, a, variety, of, terms, are, used, with, some, new, age, authors, using, different, terms, to, refer, to, the, same, trends, while, others, use, the, same, term, to, refer, to, different, things, however, hanegraaff, developed, a, set, of, categories, into, which, the, forms, of, new, age, healing, could, be, roughly, categorised, the, first, of, these, was, the, human, potential, movement, which, argues, that, contemporary, western, society, suppresses, much, human, potential, and, accordingly, professes, to, offer, a, path, through, which, individuals, can, access, those, parts, of, themselves, that, they, have, alienated, and, suppressed, thus, enabling, them, to, reach, their, full, potential, and, live, a, meaningful, life, hanegraaff, described, transpersonal, psychology, as, the, theoretical, wing, of, this, human, potential, movement, in, contrast, to, other, schools, of, psychological, thought, transpersonal, psychology, takes, religious, and, mystical, experiences, seriously, by, exploring, the, uses, of, altered, states, of, consciousness, closely, connected, to, this, is, the, shamanic, consciousness, current, which, argues, that, the, shaman, was, a, specialist, in, altered, states, of, consciousness, and, seeks, to, adopt, and, imitate, traditional, shamanic, techniques, as, a, form, of, personal, healing, and, growth, hanegraaff, identified, the, second, main, healing, current, in, the, new, age, movement, as, being, holistic, health, this, emerged, in, the, 1970s, out, of, the, free, clinic, movement, of, the, 1960s, and, has, various, connections, with, the, human, potential, movement, it, emphasises, the, idea, that, the, human, individual, is, a, holistic, interdependent, relationship, between, mind, body, and, spirit, and, that, healing, is, a, process, in, which, an, individual, becomes, whole, by, integrating, with, the, powers, of, the, universe, a, very, wide, array, of, methods, are, utilised, within, the, holistic, health, movement, with, some, of, the, most, common, including, acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, applied, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy, iridology, massage, and, other, forms, of, bodywork, meditation, and, visualisation, nutritional, therapy, psychic, healing, herbal, medicine, healing, using, crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and, reincarnation, therapy, although, the, use, of, crystal, healing, has, become, a, visual, trope, within, the, new, age, this, practice, was, not, common, in, esotericism, prior, to, their, adoption, in, the, new, age, milieu, the, mainstreaming, of, the, holistic, health, movement, in, the, uk, is, discussed, by, maria, tighe, the, inter, relation, of, holistic, health, with, the, new, age, movement, is, illustrated, in, jenny, butler, s, ethnographic, description, of, angel, therapy, in, ireland, the, new, age, is, essentially, about, the, search, for, spiritual, and, philosophical, perspectives, that, will, help, transform, humanity, and, the, world, new, agers, are, willing, to, absorb, wisdom, teachings, wherever, they, can, find, them, whether, from, an, indian, guru, a, renegade, christian, priest, an, itinerant, buddhist, monk, an, experiential, psychotherapist, or, a, native, american, shaman, they, are, eager, to, explore, their, own, inner, potential, with, a, view, to, becoming, part, of, a, broader, process, of, social, transformation, their, journey, is, towards, totality, of, being, nevill, drury, according, to, drury, the, new, age, attempts, to, create, a, worldview, that, includes, both, science, and, spirituality, while, hess, noted, how, new, agers, have, a, penchant, for, bringing, together, the, technical, and, the, spiritual, the, scientific, and, the, religious, although, new, agers, typically, reject, rationalism, the, scientific, method, and, the, academic, establishment, they, employ, terminology, and, concepts, borrowed, from, science, and, particularly, from, new, physics, moreover, a, number, of, influences, on, new, age, such, as, david, bohm, and, ilya, prigogine, had, backgrounds, as, professional, scientists, hanegraaff, identified, new, age, science, as, a, form, of, naturphilosophie, in, this, the, milieu, is, interested, in, developing, unified, world, views, to, discover, the, nature, of, the, divine, and, establish, a, scientific, basis, for, religious, belief, figures, in, the, new, age, movement, most, notably, fritjof, capra, in, his, the, tao, of, physics, 1975, and, gary, zukav, in, the, dancing, wu, li, masters, 1979, have, drawn, parallels, between, theories, in, the, new, physics, and, traditional, forms, of, mysticism, thus, arguing, that, ancient, religious, ideas, are, now, being, proven, by, contemporary, science, many, new, agers, have, adopted, james, lovelock, s, gaia, hypothesis, that, the, earth, acts, akin, to, a, single, living, organism, going, further, to, propound, that, the, earth, has, a, consciousness, and, intelligence, despite, new, agers, appeals, to, science, most, of, the, academic, and, scientific, establishments, dismiss, new, age, science, as, pseudo, science, or, at, best, existing, in, part, on, the, fringes, of, genuine, scientific, research, this, is, an, attitude, also, shared, by, many, active, in, the, field, of, parapsychology, in, turn, new, agers, often, accuse, the, scientific, establishment, of, pursuing, a, dogmatic, and, outmoded, approach, to, scientific, enquiry, believing, that, their, own, understandings, of, the, universe, will, replace, those, of, the, academic, establishment, in, a, paradigm, shift, there, is, no, ethical, cohesion, within, the, new, age, phenomenon, although, hanegraaff, argued, that, the, central, ethical, tenet, of, the, new, age, is, to, cultivate, one, s, own, divine, potential, given, that, the, movement, s, holistic, interpretation, of, the, universe, prohibits, a, belief, in, a, dualistic, good, and, evil, negative, events, that, happen, are, interpreted, not, as, the, result, of, evil, but, as, lessons, designed, to, teach, an, individual, and, enable, them, to, advance, spiritually, it, rejects, the, christian, emphasis, on, sin, and, guilt, believing, that, these, generate, fear, and, thus, negativity, which, then, hinder, spiritual, evolution, it, also, typically, criticises, the, blaming, and, judging, of, others, for, their, actions, believing, that, if, an, individual, adopts, these, negative, attitudes, it, harms, their, own, spiritual, evolution, instead, the, movement, emphasizes, positive, thinking, although, beliefs, regarding, the, power, behind, such, thoughts, vary, within, new, age, literature, common, new, age, examples, of, how, to, generate, such, positive, thinking, include, the, repeated, recitation, of, mantras, and, statements, carrying, positive, messages, and, the, visualisation, of, a, white, light, according, to, hanegraaff, the, question, of, death, and, afterlife, is, not, a, pressing, problem, requiring, an, answer, in, the, new, age, a, belief, in, reincarnation, is, very, common, where, it, is, often, viewed, as, being, part, of, an, individual, s, progressive, spiritual, evolution, toward, realisation, of, their, own, divinity, in, new, age, literature, the, reality, of, reincarnation, is, usually, treated, as, self, evident, with, no, explanation, as, to, why, practitioners, embrace, this, afterlife, belief, over, others, although, new, agers, endorse, it, in, the, belief, that, it, ensures, cosmic, justice, many, new, agers, believe, in, karma, treating, it, as, a, law, of, cause, and, effect, that, assures, cosmic, balance, although, in, some, cases, they, stress, that, it, is, not, a, system, that, enforces, punishment, for, past, actions, much, new, age, literature, on, reincarnation, says, that, part, of, the, human, soul, that, which, carries, the, personality, perishes, with, the, death, of, the, body, while, the, higher, self, that, which, connects, with, divinity, survives, in, order, to, be, reborn, into, another, body, it, is, believed, that, the, higher, self, chooses, the, body, and, circumstances, into, which, it, will, be, born, in, order, to, use, it, as, a, vessel, through, which, to, learn, new, lessons, and, thus, advance, its, own, spiritual, evolution, new, age, writers, like, shakti, gawain, and, louise, hay, therefore, express, the, view, that, humans, are, responsible, for, the, events, that, happen, to, them, during, their, life, an, idea, that, many, new, agers, regard, as, empowering, at, times, past, life, regression, are, employed, within, the, new, age, in, order, to, reveal, a, higher, soul, s, previous, incarnations, usually, with, an, explicit, healing, purpose, some, practitioners, espouse, the, idea, of, a, soul, group, or, soul, family, a, group, of, connected, souls, who, reincarnate, together, as, family, of, friendship, units, rather, than, reincarnation, another, afterlife, belief, found, among, new, agers, holds, that, an, individual, s, soul, returns, to, a, universal, energy, on, bodily, death, by, the, early, twenty, first, century, has, an, almost, entirely, white, middle, class, demography, largely, made, up, of, professional, managerial, arts, and, entrepreneurial, occupations, religious, studies, scholar, steven, j, sutcliffe, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, new, age, was, found, primarily, in, the, united, states, and, canada, western, europe, and, australia, and, new, zealand, the, fact, that, most, individuals, engaging, in, new, age, activity, do, not, describe, themselves, as, new, agers, renders, it, difficult, to, determine, the, total, number, of, practitioners, heelas, highlighted, the, range, of, attempts, to, establish, the, number, of, new, age, participants, in, the, u, s, during, this, period, noting, that, estimates, ranged, from, 20, 000, to, 6, million, he, believed, that, the, higher, ranges, of, these, estimates, were, greatly, inflated, by, for, instance, an, erroneous, assumption, that, all, americans, who, believed, in, reincarnation, were, part, of, the, new, age, he, nevertheless, suggested, that, over, 10, million, people, in, the, u, s, had, had, some, contact, with, new, age, practices, or, ideas, between, 2000, and, 2002, heelas, and, woodhead, conducted, research, into, the, new, age, in, the, english, town, of, kendal, cumbria, they, found, 600, people, actively, attended, new, age, activities, on, a, weekly, basis, representing, 1, 6, of, the, town, s, population, from, this, they, extrapolated, that, around, 900, 000, britons, regularly, took, part, in, new, age, activities, in, 2006, heelas, stated, that, new, age, practices, had, grown, to, such, an, extent, that, they, were, increasingly, rivaling, the, sway, of, christianity, in, western, settings, sociological, investigation, indicates, that, certain, sectors, of, society, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, new, age, practices, than, others, in, the, united, states, the, first, people, to, embrace, the, new, age, belonged, to, the, baby, boomer, generation, those, born, between, 1946, and, 1964, sutcliffe, noted, that, although, most, influential, new, age, figureheads, were, male, approximately, two, thirds, of, its, participants, were, female, heelas, and, woodhead, s, kendal, project, found, that, of, those, regularly, attending, new, age, activities, in, the, town, 80, were, female, while, 78, of, those, running, such, activities, were, female, they, attributed, this, female, dominance, to, deeply, entrenched, cultural, values, and, divisions, of, labour, in, western, society, according, to, which, women, were, accorded, greater, responsibility, for, the, well, being, of, others, thus, making, new, age, practices, more, attractive, to, them, they, suggested, that, men, were, less, attracted, to, new, age, activities, because, they, were, hampered, by, a, masculinist, ideal, of, autonomy, and, self, sufficiency, which, discouraged, them, from, seeking, the, assistance, of, others, for, their, inner, development, the, majority, of, new, agers, are, from, the, middle, and, upper, middle, classes, of, western, society, heelas, and, woodhead, found, that, of, the, active, kendal, new, agers, 57, had, a, university, or, college, degree, their, kendal, project, also, determined, that, 73, of, active, new, agers, were, aged, over, 45, and, 55, were, aged, between, 40, and, 59, it, also, determined, that, many, got, involved, while, middle, aged, comparatively, few, were, either, young, or, elderly, heelas, and, woodhead, suggested, that, the, dominance, of, middle, aged, people, particularly, women, was, because, at, this, stage, of, life, they, had, greater, time, to, devote, to, their, own, inner, development, with, their, time, previously, having, been, dominated, by, raising, children, they, also, suggested, that, middle, aged, people, were, experiencing, more, age, related, ailments, than, the, young, and, thus, more, keen, to, pursue, new, age, activities, to, improve, their, health, heelas, added, that, within, the, baby, boomers, the, movement, had, nevertheless, attracted, a, diverse, clientele, he, typified, the, typical, new, ager, as, someone, who, was, well, educated, yet, disenchanted, with, mainstream, society, thus, arguing, that, the, movement, catered, to, those, who, believe, that, modernity, is, in, crisis, he, suggested, that, the, movement, appealed, to, many, former, practitioners, of, the, 1960s, counter, culture, because, while, they, came, to, feel, that, they, were, unable, to, change, society, they, were, nonetheless, interested, in, changing, the, self, he, believed, that, many, individuals, had, been, culturally, primed, for, what, the, new, age, has, to, offer, with, the, new, age, attracting, expressive, people, who, were, already, comfortable, with, the, ideals, and, outlooks, of, the, movement, s, self, spirituality, focus, it, could, be, particularly, appealing, because, the, new, age, suited, the, needs, of, the, individual, whereas, traditional, religious, options, that, are, available, primarily, catered, for, the, needs, of, a, community, he, believed, that, although, the, adoption, of, new, age, beliefs, and, practices, by, some, fitted, the, model, of, religious, conversion, others, who, adopted, some, of, its, practices, could, not, easily, be, considered, to, have, converted, to, the, religion, sutcliffe, described, the, typical, participant, in, the, new, age, milieu, as, being, a, religious, individualist, mixing, and, matching, cultural, resources, in, an, animated, spiritual, quest, the, degree, to, which, individuals, are, involved, in, the, new, age, varies, heelas, argued, that, those, involved, could, be, divided, into, three, broad, groups, the, first, comprised, those, who, were, completely, dedicated, to, it, and, its, ideals, often, working, in, professions, that, furthered, those, goals, the, second, consisted, of, serious, part, timers, who, worked, in, unrelated, fields, but, who, nevertheless, spent, much, of, their, free, time, involved, in, movement, activities, the, third, was, that, of, casual, part, timers, who, occasionally, involved, themselves, in, new, age, activities, but, for, whom, the, movement, was, not, a, central, aspect, of, their, life, mackian, instead, suggested, that, involvement, could, be, seen, as, being, layered, like, an, onion, at, the, core, are, consultative, practitioners, who, devote, their, life, to, new, age, practices, around, that, are, serious, practitioners, who, still, invest, considerable, effort, into, new, age, activities, and, on, the, periphery, are, non, practitioner, consumers, individuals, affected, by, the, general, dissemination, of, new, age, ideas, but, who, do, not, devote, themselves, more, fully, to, them, many, new, age, practices, have, filtered, into, wider, western, society, with, a, 2000, poll, for, instance, revealing, that, 39, of, the, uk, population, had, tried, alternative, therapies, in, 1995, kyle, stated, that, on, the, whole, new, agers, in, the, united, states, preferred, the, values, of, the, democratic, party, over, those, of, the, republican, party, he, added, that, most, new, agers, soundly, rejected, the, agenda, of, former, republican, president, ronald, reagan, mackian, suggested, that, this, phenomenon, was, an, inherently, social, mode, of, spirituality, one, which, cultivated, a, sense, of, belonging, among, its, participants, and, encouraged, relations, both, with, other, humans, and, with, non, human, otherworldly, spirit, entities, mackian, suggested, that, these, communities, may, look, very, different, from, those, of, traditional, religious, groups, online, connections, were, one, of, the, ways, that, interested, individuals, met, new, contacts, and, established, networks, some, new, agers, advocate, living, in, a, simple, and, sustainable, manner, to, reduce, humanity, s, impact, on, the, natural, resources, of, earth, and, they, shun, consumerism, the, new, age, movement, has, been, centered, around, rebuilding, a, sense, of, community, to, counter, social, disintegration, this, has, been, attempted, through, the, formation, of, intentional, communities, where, individuals, come, together, to, live, and, work, in, a, communal, lifestyle, new, age, centres, have, been, set, up, in, various, parts, of, the, world, representing, an, institutionalised, form, of, the, movement, notable, examples, include, the, naropa, institute, in, boulder, colorado, holly, hock, farm, near, to, vancouver, the, wrekin, trust, in, west, malvern, worcestershire, and, the, skyros, centre, in, skyros, criticising, mainstream, western, education, as, counterproductive, to, the, ethos, of, the, movement, many, new, age, groups, have, established, their, own, schools, for, the, education, of, children, although, in, other, cases, such, groups, have, sought, to, introduce, new, age, spiritual, techniques, into, pre, existing, establishments, bruce, argued, that, in, seeking, to, denying, the, validity, of, externally, imposed, controls, and, privileging, the, divine, within, the, new, age, sought, to, dismantle, pre, existing, social, order, but, that, it, failed, to, present, anything, adequate, in, its, place, heelas, however, cautioned, that, bruce, had, arrived, at, this, conclusion, based, on, flimsy, evidence, and, aldred, argued, that, only, a, minority, of, new, agers, participate, in, community, focused, activities, instead, she, argued, the, majority, of, new, agers, participate, mainly, through, the, purchase, of, books, and, products, targeted, at, the, new, age, market, positioning, new, age, as, a, primarily, consumerist, and, commercial, movement, new, age, spirituality, has, led, to, a, wide, array, of, literature, on, the, subject, and, an, active, niche, market, with, books, music, crafts, and, services, in, alternative, medicine, available, at, new, age, stores, fairs, and, festivals, new, age, fairs, sometimes, known, as, mind, body, spirit, fairs, psychic, fairs, or, alternative, health, fairs, are, spaces, in, which, a, variety, of, goods, and, services, are, displayed, by, different, vendors, including, forms, of, alternative, medicine, and, esoteric, practices, such, as, palmistry, or, tarot, card, reading, an, example, is, the, mind, body, spirit, festival, held, annually, in, the, united, kingdom, at, which, the, religious, studies, scholar, christopher, partridge, noted, one, could, encounter, a, wide, range, of, beliefs, and, practices, from, crystal, healing, to, kirlian, photography, to, psychic, art, from, angels, to, past, life, therapy, from, theosophy, to, ufo, religion, and, from, new, age, music, to, the, vegetarianism, of, suma, chign, hai, similar, festivals, are, held, across, europe, and, in, australia, and, the, united, states, a, number, of, new, age, proponents, have, emphasised, the, use, of, spiritual, techniques, as, a, tool, for, attaining, financial, prosperity, thus, moving, the, movement, away, from, its, counter, cultural, origins, commenting, on, this, new, age, capitalism, hess, observed, that, it, was, largely, small, scale, and, entrepreneurial, focused, around, small, companies, run, by, members, of, the, petty, bourgeoisie, rather, than, being, dominated, by, large, scale, multinational, corporations, the, links, between, new, age, and, commercial, products, have, resulted, in, the, accusation, that, new, age, itself, is, little, more, than, a, manifestation, of, consumerism, this, idea, is, generally, rejected, by, new, age, participants, who, often, reject, any, link, between, their, practices, and, consumerist, activities, embracing, this, attitude, various, books, have, been, published, espousing, such, an, ethos, established, new, age, centres, have, held, spiritual, retreats, and, classes, aimed, specifically, at, business, people, and, new, age, groups, have, developed, specialised, training, for, businesses, during, the, 1980s, many, u, s, corporations, among, them, ibm, at, t, and, general, motors, embraced, new, age, seminars, hoping, that, they, could, increase, productivity, and, efficiency, among, their, workforce, although, in, several, cases, this, resulted, in, employees, bringing, legal, action, against, their, employers, saying, that, such, seminars, had, infringed, on, their, religious, beliefs, or, damaged, their, psychological, health, however, the, use, of, spiritual, techniques, as, a, method, for, attaining, profit, has, been, an, issue, of, major, dispute, within, the, wider, new, age, movement, with, new, agers, such, as, spangler, and, matthew, fox, criticising, what, they, see, as, trends, within, the, community, that, are, narcissistic, and, lack, a, social, conscience, in, particular, the, movement, s, commercial, elements, have, caused, problems, given, that, they, often, conflict, with, its, general, economically, egalitarian, ethos, as, york, highlighted, a, tension, exists, in, new, age, between, socialistic, egalitarianism, and, capitalistic, private, enterprise, given, that, it, encourages, individuals, to, choose, spiritual, practices, on, the, grounds, of, personal, preference, and, thus, encourages, them, to, behave, as, a, consumer, the, new, age, has, been, considered, to, be, well, suited, to, modern, society, the, term, new, age, music, is, applied, sometimes, negatively, to, forms, of, ambient, music, a, genre, that, developed, in, the, 1960s, and, was, popularised, in, the, 1970s, particularly, with, the, work, of, brian, eno, the, genre, s, relaxing, nature, resulted, in, it, becoming, popular, within, new, age, circles, with, some, forms, of, the, genre, having, a, specifically, new, age, orientation, studies, have, determined, that, new, age, music, can, be, an, effective, component, of, stress, management, the, style, began, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, with, the, works, of, free, form, jazz, groups, recording, on, the, ecm, label, such, as, oregon, the, paul, winter, consort, and, other, pre, ambient, bands, as, well, as, ambient, music, performer, brian, eno, classical, avant, garde, musician, daniel, kobialka, and, the, psychoacoustic, environments, recordings, of, irv, teibel, in, the, early, 1970s, it, was, mostly, instrumental, with, both, acoustic, and, electronic, styles, new, age, music, evolved, to, include, a, wide, range, of, styles, from, electronic, space, music, using, synthesizers, and, acoustic, instrumentals, using, native, american, flutes, and, drums, singing, bowls, australian, didgeridoos, and, world, music, sounds, to, spiritual, chanting, from, other, cultures, while, many, commentators, have, focused, on, the, spiritual, and, cultural, aspects, of, the, new, age, movement, it, also, has, a, political, component, the, new, age, political, movement, became, visible, in, the, 1970s, peaked, in, the, 1980s, and, continued, into, the, 1990s, the, sociologist, of, religion, steven, bruce, noted, that, the, new, age, provides, ideas, on, how, to, deal, with, our, socio, psychological, problems, scholar, of, religion, james, r, lewis, observed, that, despite, the, common, caricature, of, new, agers, as, narcissistic, significant, numbers, of, them, were, trying, to, make, the, planet, a, better, place, on, which, to, live, and, scholar, j, gordon, melton, s, new, age, encyclopedia, 1990, included, an, entry, called, new, age, politics, some, new, agers, have, entered, the, political, system, in, an, attempt, to, advocate, for, the, societal, transformation, that, the, new, age, promotes, although, new, age, activists, have, been, motivated, by, new, age, concepts, like, holism, interconnectedness, monism, and, environmentalism, their, political, ideas, are, diverse, ranging, from, far, right, and, conservative, through, to, liberal, socialist, and, libertarian, accordingly, kyle, stated, that, new, age, politics, is, difficult, to, describe, and, categorize, the, standard, political, labels, left, or, right, liberal, or, conservative, miss, the, mark, mackian, suggested, that, the, new, age, operated, as, a, form, of, world, realigning, infrapolitics, that, undermines, the, disenchantment, of, modern, western, society, the, extent, to, which, new, age, spokespeople, mix, religion, and, politics, varies, new, agers, are, often, critical, of, the, established, political, order, regarding, it, as, fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and, obsolete, the, new, ager, mark, satin, for, instance, spoke, of, new, age, politics, as, a, politically, radical, third, force, that, was, neither, left, nor, right, he, believed, that, in, contrast, to, the, conventional, political, focus, on, the, institutional, and, economic, symptoms, of, society, s, problems, his, new, age, politics, would, focus, on, psychocultural, roots, of, these, issues, ferguson, regarded, new, age, politics, as, a, kind, of, radical, centre, one, that, was, not, neutral, not, middle, of, the, road, but, a, view, of, the, whole, road, fritjof, capra, argued, that, western, societies, have, become, sclerotic, because, of, their, adherence, to, an, outdated, and, mechanistic, view, of, reality, which, he, calls, the, newtonian, cartesian, paradigm, in, capra, s, view, the, west, needs, to, develop, an, organic, and, ecological, systems, view, of, reality, in, order, to, successfully, address, its, social, and, political, issues, corinne, mclaughlin, argued, that, politics, need, not, connote, endless, power, struggles, that, a, new, spiritual, politics, could, attempt, to, synthesize, opposing, views, on, issues, into, higher, levels, of, understanding, many, new, agers, advocate, globalisation, and, localisation, but, reject, nationalism, and, the, role, of, the, nation, state, some, new, age, spokespeople, have, called, for, greater, decentralisation, and, global, unity, but, are, vague, about, how, this, might, be, achieved, others, call, for, a, global, centralised, government, satin, for, example, argued, for, a, move, away, from, the, nation, state, and, towards, self, governing, regions, that, through, improved, global, communication, networks, would, help, engender, world, unity, benjamin, creme, conversely, argued, that, the, christ, a, great, avatar, maitreya, the, world, teacher, expected, by, all, the, major, religions, as, their, awaited, one, would, return, to, the, world, and, establish, a, strong, centralised, global, government, in, the, form, of, the, united, nations, this, would, be, politically, re, organised, along, a, spiritual, hierarchy, kyle, observed, that, new, agers, often, speak, favourably, of, democracy, and, citizens, involvement, in, policy, making, but, are, critical, of, representative, democracy, and, majority, rule, thus, displaying, elitist, ideas, to, their, thinking, scholars, have, noted, several, new, age, political, groups, self, determination, a, personal, political, network, lauded, by, ferguson, and, satin, was, described, at, length, by, sociology, of, religion, scholar, steven, tipton, founded, in, 1975, by, california, state, legislator, john, vasconcellos, and, others, it, encouraged, californians, to, engage, in, personal, growth, work, and, political, activities, at, the, same, time, especially, at, the, grassroots, level, hanegraaff, noted, another, california, based, group, the, institute, of, noetic, sciences, headed, by, the, author, willis, harman, it, advocated, a, change, in, consciousness, in, basic, underlying, assumptions, in, order, to, come, to, grips, with, global, crises, kyle, said, that, the, new, york, city, based, planetary, citizens, organization, headed, by, united, nations, consultant, and, earth, at, omega, author, donald, keys, sought, to, implement, new, age, political, ideas, scholar, j, gordon, melton, and, colleagues, focused, on, the, new, world, alliance, a, washington, dc, based, organization, founded, in, 1979, by, mark, satin, and, others, according, to, melton, et, al, the, alliance, tried, to, combine, left, and, right, wing, ideas, as, well, as, personal, growth, work, and, political, activities, group, decision, making, was, facilitated, by, short, periods, of, silence, sponsors, of, the, alliance, s, national, political, newsletter, included, willis, harman, and, john, vasconcellos, scholar, james, r, lewis, counted, green, politics, as, one, of, the, new, age, s, more, visible, activities, one, academic, book, says, that, the, u, s, green, party, movement, began, as, an, initiative, of, a, handful, of, activists, including, charlene, spretnak, co, author, of, a, new, age, interpretation, of, the, german, green, movement, capra, and, spretnak, s, green, politics, and, mark, satin, author, of, new, age, politics, another, academic, publication, says, spretnak, and, satin, largely, co, drafted, the, u, s, greens, founding, document, the, ten, key, values, statement, while, the, term, new, age, may, have, fallen, out, of, favor, scholar, george, chryssides, notes, that, the, new, age, by, whatever, name, is, still, alive, and, active, in, the, 21st, century, in, the, realm, of, politics, new, ager, mark, satin, s, book,

anderson, said, that, much, of, it, was, an, attempt, to, stereotype, the, movement, for, idealistic, and, spiritual, change, and, to, cut, back, on, its, popularity, new, age, theoretician, david, spangler, tried, to, distance, himself, from, what, he, called, the, new, age, glamour, of, crystals, talk, show, channelers, and, other, easily, commercialized, phenomena, and, sought, to, underscore, his, commitment, to, the, new, age, as, a, vision, of, genuine, social, transformation, initially, academic, interest, in, the, new, age, was, minimal, the, earliest, academic, studies, of, the, new, age, phenomenon, were, performed, by, specialists, in, the, study, of, new, religious, movements, such, as, robert, ellwood, this, research, was, often, scanty, because, many, scholars, regarded, the, new, age, as, an, insignificant, cultural, fad, having, been, influenced, by, the, u, s, anti, cult, movement, much, of, it, was, also, largely, negative, and, critical, of, new, age, groups, the, first, truly, scholarly, study, of, the, phenomenon, was, an, edited, volume, put, together, by, james, r, lewis, and, j, gordon, melton, in, 1992, from, that, point, on, the, number, of, published, academic, studies, steadily, increased, in, 1994, christoph, bochinger, published, his, study, of, the, new, age, in, germany, new, age, und, moderne, religion, this, was, followed, by,

hammer, later, described, it, as, having, a, well, deserved, reputation, as, the, standard, reference, work, on, the, new, age, most, of, these, early, studies, were, based, on, a, textual, analysis, of, new, age, publications, rather, than, on, an, ethnographic, analysis, of, its, practitioners, sutcliffe, and, gilhus, argued, that, new, age, studies, could, be, seen, as, having, experienced, two, waves, in, the, first, scholars, focused, on, macro, level, analyses, of, the, content, and, boundaries, of, the, movement, while, the, second, wave, featured, more, variegated, and, contextualized, studies, of, particular, beliefs, and, practices, sutcliffe, and, gilhus, have, also, expressed, concern, that, as, of, 2013, new, age, studies, has, yet, to, formulate, a, set, of, research, questions, scholars, can, pursue, the, new, age, has, proved, a, challenge, for, scholars, of, religion, operating, under, more, formative, models, of, what, religion, is, by, 2006, heelas, noted, that, the, new, age, was, so, vast, and, diverse, that, no, scholar, of, the, subject, could, hope, to, keep, up, with, all, of, it, mainstream, christianity, has, typically, rejected, the, ideas, of, the, new, age, christian, critiques, often, emphasise, that, the, new, age, places, the, human, individual, before, god, most, published, criticism, of, the, new, age, has, been, produced, by, christians, particularly, those, on, the, religion, s, fundamentalist, wing, in, the, united, states, the, new, age, became, a, major, concern, of, evangelical, christian, groups, in, the, 1980s, an, attitude, that, influenced, british, evangelical, groups, during, that, decade, evangelical, writers, such, as, constance, cumbey, dave, hunt, gary, north, and, douglas, groothuis, published, books, criticising, the, new, age, a, number, propagated, conspiracy, theories, regarding, its, origin, and, purpose, the, most, successful, such, publication, was, frank, e, peretti, s, 1986, novel, this, present, darkness, which, sold, over, a, million, copies, it, depicted, the, new, age, as, being, in, league, with, feminism, and, secular, education, as, part, of, a, conspiracy, to, overthrow, christianity, modern, christian, critics, of, the, new, age, include, doreen, virtue, a, former, new, age, writer, from, california, who, converted, to, fundamentalist, christianity, in, 2017, official, responses, to, the, new, age, have, been, produced, by, major, christian, organisations, like, the, roman, catholic, church, the, church, of, england, and, the, methodist, church, the, roman, catholic, church, published, a, christian, reflection, on, the, new, age, in, 2003, following, a, six, year, study, the, 90, page, document, criticizes, new, age, practices, such, as, yoga, meditation, feng, shui, and, crystal, healing, according, to, the, vatican, euphoric, states, attained, through, new, age, practices, should, not, be, confused, with, prayer, or, viewed, as, signs, of, god, s, presence, cardinal, paul, poupard, then, president, of, the, pontifical, council, for, culture, said, the, new, age, is, a, misleading, answer, to, the, oldest, hopes, of, man, monsignor, michael, fitzgerald, then, president, of, the, pontifical, council, for, interreligious, dialogue, stated, at, the, vatican, conference, on, the, document, the, church, avoids, any, concept, that, is, close, to, those, of, the, new, age, on, the, contrary, some, fringe, christian, groups, have, adopted, a, more, positive, view, of, the, new, age, among, them, the, christaquarians, and, christians, awakening, to, a, new, awareness, all, of, which, believe, that, new, age, ideas, can, enhance, a, person, s, christian, faith, neopagan, practices, highlight, the, centrality, of, the, relationship, between, humans, and, nature, and, reinvent, religions, of, the, past, while, new, agers, are, more, interested, in, transforming, individual, consciousness, and, shaping, the, future, religious, studies, scholar, sarah, pike, there, is, academic, debate, about, the, connection, between, the, new, age, and, modern, paganism, sometimes, termed, neo, paganism, the, two, phenomena, have, often, been, confused, and, conflated, particularly, in, christian, critiques, religious, studies, scholar, sarah, pike, asserted, that, there, was, a, significant, overlap, between, the, two, religious, movements, while, aidan, a, kelly, stated, that, paganism, parallels, the, new, age, movement, in, some, ways, differs, sharply, from, it, in, others, and, overlaps, it, in, some, minor, ways, other, scholars, have, identified, them, as, distinct, phenomena, that, share, overlap, and, commonalities, hanegraaff, suggested, that, whereas, various, forms, of, contemporary, paganism, were, not, part, of, the, new, age, movement, particularly, those, that, pre, dated, the, movement, other, pagan, religions, and, practices, could, be, identified, as, new, age, partridge, portrayed, both, paganism, and, the, new, age, as, different, streams, of, occulture, occult, culture, that, merge, at, points, various, differences, between, the, two, movements, have, been, highlighted, the, new, age, movement, focuses, on, an, improved, future, whereas, the, focus, of, paganism, is, on, the, pre, christian, past, similarly, the, new, age, movement, typically, propounds, a, universalist, message, that, sees, all, religions, as, fundamentally, the, same, whereas, paganism, stresses, the, difference, between, monotheistic, religions, and, those, embracing, a, polytheistic, or, animistic, theology, while, the, new, age, emphasises, a, light, centred, image, paganism, acknowledges, both, light, and, dark, life, and, death, and, recognises, the, savage, side, of, the, natural, world, many, pagans, have, sought, to, distance, themselves, from, the, new, age, movement, even, using, new, age, as, an, insult, within, their, community, while, conversely, many, involved, in, the, new, age, have, expressed, criticism, of, paganism, for, emphasizing, the, material, world, over, the, spiritual, many, pagans, have, expressed, criticism, of, the, high, fees, charged, by, new, age, teachers, something, not, typically, present, in, the, pagan, movement, new, age, often, adopts, spiritual, ideas, and, practices, from, other, particularly, non, western, cultures, according, to, york, these, may, include, hawaiian, kahuna, magic, australian, aboriginal, dream, working, south, american, amerindian, ayahuasca, and, san, pedro, ceremonies, hindu, ayurveda, and, yoga, chinese, feng, shui, qi, gong, and, tai, chi, the, new, age, has, been, accused, of, cultural, imperialism, misappropriating, sacred, ceremonies, and, exploitation, of, the, intellectual, and, cultural, property, of, indigenous, peoples, indigenous, american, spiritual, leaders, such, as, elders, councils, of, the, lakota, cheyenne, navajo, creek, hopi, chippewa, and, haudenosaunee, have, denounced, new, age, misappropriation, of, their, sacred, ceremonies, and, other, intellectual, property, stating, that, he, value, of, these, instructions, and, ceremonies, are, questionable, maybe, meaningless, and, hurtful, to, the, individual, carrying, false, messages, traditional, leaders, of, the, lakota, dakota, and, nakota, peoples, have, reached, consensus, to, reject, the, expropriation, of, ceremonial, ways, by, non, indians, they, see, the, new, age, movement, as, either, not, fully, understanding, deliberately, trivializing, or, distorting, their, way, of, life, and, strongly, disapprove, of, all, such, plastic, medicine, people, who, are, appropriating, their, spiritual, ways, indigenous, leaders, have, spoken, out, against, individuals, from, within, their, own, communities, who, may, go, out, into, the, world, to, become, a, white, man, s, shaman, and, any, who, are, prostituting, our, spiritual, ways, for, their, own, selfish, gain, with, no, regard, for, the, spiritual, well, being, of, the, people, as, a, whole, the, terms, plastic, shaman, and, plastic, medicine, person, have, been, used, to, describe, an, outsider, who, identifies, or, promotes, themselves, as, a, shaman, holy, person, or, other, traditional, spiritual, leader, yet, has, no, genuine, connection, to, the, traditions, or, cultures, represented, new, age, politics, might, be, seen, not, as, a, wayward, pathological, creature, of, the, new, left, s, imagination, but, as, a, political, innocent, in, candid, questioning, dialogue, with, the, unclaimed, mainstream, territory, of, progressive, rather, than, atomistic, individualism, indeed, if, we, were, to, examine, some, of, the, social, and, political, threads, that, run, through, the, aery, fabric, of, new, age, thinking, we, would, find, certain, themes, that, resonate, with, the, necessary, conditions, for, a, left, version, of, progressive, individualism, generally, speaking, new, age, addresses, its, adherents, as, active, participants, with, a, measure, of, control, over, their, everyday, lives, the, new, age, person, is, also, in, many, respects, an, individual, whose, personal, growth, is, indissociable, from, the, environment, a, link, fleshed, out, in, a, variety, of, ecotopian, stories, and, romances, so, too, the, small, scale, imperative, of, new, age, s, cooperative, communitarianism, brings, with, it, a, host, of, potentially, critical, positions, scholar, of, cultural, studies, andrew, ross, 1991, toward, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, some, social, and, political, analysts, and, activists, were, arguing, that, the, new, age, political, perspective, had, something, to, offer, mainstream, society, in, 1987, some, political, scientists, launched, the, section, on, ecological, and, transformational, politics, of, the, american, political, science, association, and, an, academic, book, prepared, by, three, of, them, stated, that, the, transformational, politics, concept, was, meant, to, subsume, such, terms, as, new, age, and, new, paradigm, in, 1991, scholar, of, cultural, studies, andrew, ross, suggested, that, new, age, political, ideas, however, muddled, and, na, ve, could, help, progressives, construct, an, appealing, alternative, to, both, atomistic, individualism, and, self, denying, collectivism, in, 2005, british, researcher, stuart, rose, urged, scholars, of, alternative, religions, to, pay, more, attention, to, the, new, age, s, interest, in, such, topics, as, new, socio, political, thinking, and, new, economics, topics, rose, discussed, in, his, book, transforming, the, world, bringing, the, new, age, into, focus, issued, by, a, european, academic, publisher, other, political, thinkers, and, activists, saw, new, age, politics, less, positively, on, the, political, right, author, george, weigel, argued, that, new, age, politics, was, just, a, retooled, and, pastel, colored, version, of, leftism, conservative, evangelical, writer, douglas, groothuis, discussed, by, scholars, hexham, and, kemp, warned, that, new, age, politics, could, lead, to, an, oppressive, world, government, on, the, left, scholars, argued, that, new, age, politics, was, an, oxymoron, that, personal, growth, has, little, or, nothing, to, do, with, political, change, one, political, scientist, said, new, age, politics, fails, to, recognize, the, reality, of, economic, and, political, power, another, academic, dana, l, cloud, wrote, a, lengthy, critique, of, new, age, politics, as, a, political, ideology, she, faulted, it, for, not, being, opposed, to, the, capitalist, system, or, to, liberal, individualism, a, criticism, of, new, age, often, made, by, leftists, is, that, its, focus, on, individualism, deflects, participants, from, engaging, in, socio, political, activism, this, perspective, regards, new, age, as, a, manifestation, of, consumerism, that, promotes, elitism, and, indulgence, by, allowing, wealthier, people, to, affirm, their, socio, economic, status, through, consuming, new, age, products, and, therapies, new, agers, who, do, engage, in, socio, political, activism, have, also, been, criticized, journalist, harvey, wasserman, suggested, that, new, age, activists, were, too, averse, to, social, conflict, to, be, effective, politically, melton, et, al, found, that, new, age, activists, commitment, to, the, often, frustrating, process, of, consensus, decision, making, led, to, extended, meetings, and, minimal, results, and, a, pair, of, futurists, concluded, that, one, once, promising, new, age, activist, group, had, been, both, too, visionary, and, too, vague, to, last
