the, god, s, favour, minos, was, to, sacrifice, the, bull, to, honor, poseidon, but, owing, to, the, bull, s, beauty, he, decided, instead, to, keep, him, minos, believed, that, the, god, would,

a, man, with, the, head, of, a, bull, from, classical, antiquity, through, the, renaissance, the, minotaur, appears, at, the, center, of, many, depictions, of, the, labyrinth, ovid, s, latin, account, of, the, minotaur, which, did, not, describe, which, half, was, bull, and, which, half, man, was, the, most, widely, available, during, the, middle, ages, and, several, later, versions, show, a, man, s, head, and, torso, on, a, bull, s, body, the, reverse, of, the, classical, configuration, reminiscent, of, a, centaur, this, alternative, tradition, survived, into, the, renaissance, and, is, reflected, in, dryden, s, elaborated, translation, of, virgil, s, description, of, the, minotaur, in, book, vi, of, the, aeneid, the, lower, part, a, beast, a, man, above, the, monument, of, their,

androgeus, son, of, king, minos, died, and, that, the, fault, lay, with, the, athenians, the, sacrifice, of, young, athenian, men, and, women, was, a, penalty, for, his, death, in, some, versions, he, was, killed, by, the, athenians, because, of, their, jealousy, of, the, victories, he, had, won, at, the, panathenaic, games, in, others, he, was, killed, at, marathon, by, the, cretan, bull, his, mother, s, former, taurine, lover, because, aegeus, king, of, athens, had, commanded, androgeus, to, slay, it, the, common, tradition, holds, that, minos, waged, a, war, of, revenge, for, the, death, of, his, son, and, won, the, consequence, of, athens, losing, the, war, was, the, regular, sacrifice, of, several, of, their, youths, and, maidens, pausanias, account, of, the, myth, said, that, minos, had, led, a, fleet, against, athens, and, simply, harassed, the, athenians, until, they, had, agreed, to, send, children, as, sacrifices, in, his, account, of, the, minotaur, s, birth, catullus, refers, to, yet, another, version, in, which, athens, was, compelled, by, the, cruel, plague, to, pay, penalties, for, the, killing, of, androgeon, to, avert, a, plague, caused, by, divine, retribution, for, the, cretan, prince, s, death, aegeus, had, to, send, into, the, labyrinth, young, men, at, the, same, time, as, the, best, of, unwed, girls, as, a, feast, for, the, minotaur, some, accounts, declare, that, minos, required, seven, athenian, youths, and, seven, maidens, chosen, by, lots, to, be, sent, every, seventh, year, or, ninth, some, versions, say, every, year, when, the, time, for, the, third, sacrifice, approached, the, athenian, prince, theseus, volunteered, to, slay, the, minotaur, isocrates, orates, that, theseus, thought, that, he, would, rather, die, than, rule, a, city, that, paid, a, tribute, of, children, s, lives, to, their, enemy, he, promised, his, father, aegeus, that, he, would, change, the, somber, black, sail, of, the, boat, carrying, the, victims, from, athens, to, crete, and, put, up, a, white, sail, for, his, return, journey, if, he, was, successful, the, crew, would, leave, up, the, black, sail, if, he, was, killed, in, crete, minos, s, daughter, ariadne, fell, madly, in, love, with, theseus, and, helped, him, navigate, the, labyrinth, in, most, accounts, she, gave, him, a, ball, of, thread, allowing, him, to, retrace, his, path, according, to, various, classical, sources, and, representations, theseus, killed, the, minotaur, with, his, bare, hands, sometimes, with, a, club, or, a, sword, he, then, led, the, athenians, out, of, the, labyrinth, and, they, sailed, with, ariadne, away, from, crete, on, the, way, home, theseus, abandoned, ariadne, on, the, island, of, naxos, and, continued, to, athens, the, returning, group, neglected, to, replace, the, black, sail, with, the, promised, white, sail, and, from, his, lookout, on, cape, sounion, king, aegeus, saw, the, black, sailed, ship, approach, presuming, his, son, dead, he, killed, himself, by, leaping, into, the, sea, that, is, since, named, after, him, his, death, secured, the, throne, for, theseus, the, contest, between, theseus, and, the, minotaur, was, frequently, represented, in, greek, art, a, knossian, didrachm, exhibits, on, one, side, the, labyrinth, on, the, other, the, minotaur, surrounded, by, a, semicircle, of, small, balls, probably, intended, for, stars, one, of, the, monster, s, names, was, asterion, or, asterius, star, pasipha, gave, birth, to, asterius, who, was, called, the, minotaur, he, had, the, face, of, a, bull, but, the, rest, of, him, was, human, and, minos, in, compliance, with, certain, oracles, shut, him, up, and, guarded, him, in, the, labyrinth, while, the, ruins, of, minos, s, palace, at, knossos, were, discovered, the, labyrinth, never, was, the, multiplicity, of, rooms, staircases, and, corridors, in, the, palace, has, led, some, archaeologists, to, suggest, that, the, palace, itself, was, the, source, of, the, labyrinth, myth, with, over, 1300, maze, like, compartments, an, idea, that, is, now, generally, discredited, homer, describing, the, shield, of, achilles, remarked, that, daedalus, had, constructed, a, ceremonial, dancing, ground, for, ariadne, but, does, not, associate, this, with, the, term, labyrinth, some, 19th, century, mythologists, proposed, that, the, minotaur, was, a, personification, of, the, sun, and, a, minoan, adaptation, of, the, baal, moloch, of, the, phoenicians, the, slaying, of, the, minotaur, by, theseus, in, that, case, could, be, interpreted, as, a, memory, of, athens, breaking, tributary, relations, with, minoan, crete, according, to, a, b, cook, minos, and, minotaur, were, different, forms, of, the, same, personage, representing, the, sun, god, of, the, cretans, who, depicted, the, sun, as, a, bull, he, and, j, g, frazer, both, explain, pasipha, s, union, with, the, bull, as, a, sacred, ceremony, at, which, the, queen, of, knossos, was, wedded, to, a, bull, formed, god, just, as, the, wife, of, the, tyrant, in, athens, was, wedded, to, dionysus, e, pottier, who, does, not, dispute, the, historical, personality, of, minos, in, view, of, the, story, of, phalaris, considers, it, probable, that, in, crete, where, a, bull, cult, may, have, existed, by, the, side, of, that, of, the, labrys, victims, were, tortured, by, being, shut, up, in, the, belly, of, a, red, hot, brazen, bull, the, story, of, talos, the, cretan, man, of, brass, who, heated, himself, red, hot, and, clasped, strangers, in, his, embrace, as, soon, as, they, landed, on, the, island, is, probably, of, similar, origin, karl, kerenyi, viewed, the, minotaur, or, asterios, as, a, god, associated, with, stars, comparable, to, dionysus, coins, minted, at, knossos, from, the, fifth, century, showed, labyrinth, patterns, encircling, a, goddess, s, head, crowned, with, a, wreath, of, grain, a, bull, s, head, or, a, star, kerenyi, argued, that, the, star, in, the, labyrinth, was, in, fact, asterios, making, the, minotaur, a, luminous, deity, in, crete, associated, with, a, goddess, known, as, the, mistress, of, the, labyrinth, a, geological, interpretation, also, exists, citing, early, descriptions, of, the, minotaur, by, callimachus, as, being, entirely, focused, on, the, cruel, bellowing, it, made, from, its, underground, labyrinth, and, the, extensive, tectonic, activity, in, the, region, science, journalist, matt, kaplan, has, theorised, that, the, myth, may, well, stem, from, geology, the, minotaur, infamia, di, creti, italian, for, infamy, of, crete, appears, briefly, in, dante, s, inferno, in, canto, 12, l, 12, 13, 16, 21, where, dante, and, his, guide, virgil, find, themselves, picking, their, way, among, boulders, dislodged, on, the, slope, and, preparing, to, enter, into, the, seventh, circle, of, hell, dante, and, virgil, encounter, the, beast, first, among, the, men, of, blood, those, damned, for, their, violent, natures, some, commentators, believe, that, dante, in, a, reversal, of, classical, tradition, bestowed, the, beast, with, a, man, s, head, upon, a, bull, s, body, though, this, representation, had, already, appeared, in, the, middle, ages, pp, 116, 117, lo, savio, mio, inver, lui, grid, forse, tu, credi, che, qui, sia, l, duca, d, atene, che, s, nel, mondo, la, morte, ti,

represents, fraud, in, canto, xvi, and, serves, a, similar, role, as, gatekeeper, for, the, entire, seventh, circle, giovanni, boccaccio, writes, of, the, minotaur, in, his, literary, commentary, of, the, commedia, when, he, had, grown, up, and, become, a, most, ferocious, animal, and, of, incredible, strength, they, tell, that, minos, had, him, shut, up, in, a, prison, called, the, labyrinth,
