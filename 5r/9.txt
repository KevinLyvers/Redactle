classification, divides, stika, and, n, stika, schools, of, philosophy, depending, on, one, of, three, alternate, criteria, whether, it, believes, the, vedas, as, a, valid, source, of, knowledge, whether, the, school, believes, in, the, premises, of, brahman, and, atman, and, whether, the, school, believes, in, afterlife, and, devas, though, there, are, exceptions, to, the, latter, two,

to, the, aiva, and, rase, vara, traditions, the, main, schools, of, indian, philosophy, were, formalised, and, recognised, chiefly, between, 500, bce, and, the, late, centuries, of, the, common, era, some, schools, like, jainism, buddhism, yoga, aiva, and, vedanta, survived, but, others, like, aj, ana, charvaka, and, j, vika, did, not, ancient, and, medieval, era, texts, of, indian, philosophies, include, extensive, discussions, on, ontology, metaphysics, brahman, atman, sunyata, anatta, reliable, means, of, knowledge, epistemology, pramanas, value, system, axiology, and, other, topics, indian, philosophies, share, many, concepts, such, as, dharma, karma, samsara, dukkha, renunciation, meditation, with, almost, all, of, them, focusing, on, the, ultimate, goal, of, liberation, of, the, individual, from, dukkha, and, samsara, through, diverse, range, of, spiritual, practices, moksha, nirvana, while, many, sutra, texts, explicitly, mention, that, the, work, leads, to, moksha, indian, philosophy, is, not, exclusively, concerned, with, moksha, they, differ, in, their, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, existence, as, well, as, the, specifics, of, the, path, to, the, ultimate, liberation, resulting, in, numerous, schools, that, disagreed, with, each, other, their, ancient, doctrines, span, the, diverse, range, of, philosophies, found, in, other, ancient, cultures, some, of, the, earliest, surviving, indian, philosophical, texts, are, the, upanishads, of, the, later, vedic, period, 1000, 500, bce, which, are, considered, to, preserve, the, ideas, of, brahmanism, indian, philosophical, traditions, are, commonly, grouped, according, to, their, relationship, to, the, vedas, and, the, ideas, contained, in, them, jainism, and, buddhism, originated, at, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, while, the, various, traditions, grouped, under, hinduism, mostly, emerged, after, the, vedic, period, as, independent, traditions, hindu, philosophy, classify, indian, philosophical, traditions, as, either, orthodox, stika, or, heterodox, n, stika, depending, on, whether, they, accept, the, authority, of, the, vedas, and, the, theories, of, brahman, and, tman, found, therein, besides, these, the, heterodox, schools, that, do, not, accept, the, authority, of, the, vedas, include, buddhism, jainism, ajivika, and, charvaka, this, orthodox, heterodox, terminology, is, a, scholarly, construct, found, in, later, indian, sources, and, in, western, sources, on, indian, thought, and, not, all, of, these, sources, agree, on, which, system, should, be, considered, orthodox, as, such, there, are, various, heresiological, systems, in, indian, philosophy, some, traditions, see, orthodox, as, a, synonym, for, theism, and, heterodox, as, a, synonym, for, atheism, other, hindu, sources, argue, that, certain, systems, of, shaiva, tantra, should, be, considered, heterodox, due, to, its, deviations, from, the, vedic, tradition, one, of, the, most, common, list, of, hindu, orthodox, schools, is, the, six, philosophies, a, dar, ana, which, are, sometimes, these, six, are, coupled, into, three, groups, for, both, historical, and, conceptual, reasons, ny, ya, vai, e, ika, s, khya, yoga, and, m, m, s, ved, nta, each, tradition, also, included, different, currents, and, sub, schools, for, example, ved, nta, was, divided, among, the, sub, schools, of, advaita, non, dualism, visishtadvaita, qualified, non, dualism, dvaita, dualism, dvaitadvaita, dualistic, non, dualism, suddhadvaita, pure, non, dualism, and, achintya, bheda, abheda, inconceivable, oneness, and, difference, the, doctrines, of, the, vedas, and, upanishads, were, interpreted, differently, by, these, six, schools, with, varying, degrees, of, overlap, they, represent, a, collection, of, philosophical, views, that, share, a, textual, connection, according, to, chadha, 2015, they, also, reflect, a, tolerance, for, a, diversity, of, philosophical, interpretations, within, hinduism, while, sharing, the, same, foundation, hindu, philosophers, of, the, orthodox, schools, developed, systems, of, epistemology, pramana, and, investigated, topics, such, as, metaphysics, ethics, psychology, gu, a, hermeneutics, and, soteriology, within, the, framework, of, the, vedic, knowledge, while, presenting, a, diverse, collection, of, interpretations, the, commonly, named, six, orthodox, schools, were, the, competing, philosophical, traditions, of, what, has, been, called, the, hindu, synthesis, of, classical, hinduism, all, these, systems, are, not, the, only, orthodox, systems, of, philosophy, as, numerous, sub, schools, developed, throughout, the, history, of, hindu, thought, they, are, however, the, most, well, known, hindu, philosophical, traditions, in, addition, to, the, six, systems, the, hindu, philosopher, vidy, ra, ya, ca, 1374, 1380, also, includes, several, further, hindu, philosophical, systems, in, his, sarva, dar, ana, sa, graha, a, compendium, of, all, the, philosophical, systems, several, non, vedic, traditions, of, thought, also, flourished, in, ancient, india, and, they, developed, their, own, philosophical, systems, the, rama, a, movement, included, various, traditions, which, did, not, accept, the, brahmanical, religion, of, the, vedas, these, non, vedic, schools, gave, rise, to, a, diverse, range, of, ideas, about, topics, like, the, atman, atomism, ethics, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, free, will, asceticism, family, life, ahimsa, non, violence, and, vegetarianism, notable, philosophies, that, arose, from, the, rama, a, movement, were, jainism, early, buddhism, charvaka, aj, ana, and, j, vika, indian, rama, a, movements, became, prominent, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, and, even, more, so, during, the, mauryan, period, c, 322, 184, bce, jainism, and, buddhism, were, especially, influential, these, traditions, influenced, all, later, forms, of, indian, philosophy, who, either, adopted, some, of, their, ideas, or, reacted, against, them, aj, ana, was, one, of, the, n, stika, or, heterodox, schools, of, ancient, indian, philosophy, and, the, ancient, school, of, radical, indian, skepticism, it, was, a, rama, a, movement, and, a, major, rival, of, early, buddhism, and, jainism, their, ideas, are, recorded, in, buddhist, and, jain, texts, they, held, that, it, was, impossible, to, obtain, knowledge, of, metaphysical, nature, or, ascertain, the, truth, value, of, philosophical, propositions, and, even, if, knowledge, was, possible, it, was, useless, and, disadvantageous, for, final, salvation, they, were, sophists, who, specialised, in, refutation, without, propagating, any, positive, doctrine, of, their, own, jain, philosophy, is, the, oldest, indian, philosophy, that, separates, body, matter, from, the, soul, consciousness, completely, jainism, was, revived, and, re, established, after, mahavira, the, last, and, the, 24th, tirthankara, synthesised, and, revived, the, philosophies, and, promulgations, of, the, ancient, rama, ic, traditions, laid, down, by, the, first, jain, tirthankara, rishabhanatha, millions, of, years, ago, according, to, dundas, outside, of, the, jain, tradition, historians, date, the, mahavira, as, about, contemporaneous, with, the, buddha, in, the, 5th, century, bce, and, accordingly, the, historical, parshvanatha, based, on, the, c, 250, year, gap, is, placed, in, 8th, or, 7th, century, bce, jainism, is, a, rama, ic, religion, and, rejected, the, authority, of, the, vedas, however, like, all, indian, religions, it, shares, the, core, concepts, such, as, karma, ethical, living, rebirth, samsara, and, moksha, jainism, places, strong, emphasis, on, asceticism, ahimsa, non, violence, and, anekantavada, relativity, of, viewpoints, as, a, means, of, spiritual, liberation, ideas, that, influenced, other, indian, traditions, jainism, strongly, upholds, the, individualistic, nature, of, soul, and, personal, responsibility, for, one, s, decisions, and, that, self, reliance, and, individual, efforts, alone, are, responsible, for, one, s, liberation, according, to, the, jain, philosophy, the, world, sa, s, ra, is, full, of, hi, s, violence, therefore, one, should, direct, all, his, efforts, in, attainment, of, ratnatraya, that, are, samyak, darshan, right, perception, samyak, gnana, right, knowledge, and, samyak, ch, ritra, right, conduct, which, are, the, key, requisites, to, attain, liberation, buddhist, philosophy, refers, to, several, traditions, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, teachings, of, siddhartha, gautama, the, buddha, awakened, one, buddhism, is, a, rama, a, religion, but, it, contains, novel, ideas, not, found, or, accepted, by, other, rama, a, religions, such, as, the, buddhist, doctrine, of, not, self, anatta, buddhist, thought, is, also, influenced, by, the, thought, of, the, upanishads, buddhism, and, hinduism, mutually, influenced, each, other, and, shared, many, concepts, however, it, is, now, difficult, to, identify, and, describe, these, influences, buddhism, rejected, the, vedic, concepts, of, brahman, ultimate, reality, and, atman, soul, self, at, the, foundation, of, hindu, philosophies, buddhism, shares, many, philosophical, views, with, other, indian, systems, such, as, belief, in, karma, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, samsara, ideas, about, cyclic, afterlife, and, rebirth, dharma, ideas, about, ethics, duties, and, values, impermanence, of, all, material, things, and, of, body, and, possibility, of, spiritual, liberation, nirvana, or, moksha, a, major, departure, from, hindu, and, jain, philosophy, is, the, buddhist, rejection, of, an, eternal, soul, atman, in, favour, of, anatta, non, self, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, several, competing, philosophical, systems, termed, abhidharma, began, to, emerge, as, ways, to, systematize, buddhist, philosophy, the, main, traditions, of, buddhist, philosophy, in, india, from, 300, bce, to, 1000, ce, can, be, divided, into, mahayana, schools, and, non, mahayana, schools, sometimes, called, r, vakay, na, schools, nikaya, buddhism, mainstream, buddhism, or, hinayana,

mahayana, mah, y, na, traditions, the, mah, y, na, great, vehicle, movement, c, 1st, century, bce, onwards, included, new, ideas, and, scriptures, mahayana, sutras, these, philosophical, traditions,

universal, altruistic, ideal, of, the, bodhisattva, a, being, who, is, on, the, path, to, buddhahood, for, the, sake, of, all, living, beings, it, also, defends, the, doctrine, that, there, are, limitless, number, of, buddhas, throughout, limitless, numbers, of, universes, these, indian, traditions, are, the, main, source, of, modern, tibetan, buddhism, and, of, modern, east, asian, buddhism, the, main, indian, mahayana, schools, of, philosophy, are, many, of, these, philosophies, were, brought, to, other, regions, like, central, asia, and, china, after, the, disappearance, of, buddhism, from, india, some, of, these, philosophical, traditions, continued, to, develop, in, the, tibetan, buddhist, east, asian, buddhist, and, theravada, buddhist, traditions, the, philosophy, of, j, vika,

communities, prone, to, an, ascetic, and, simple, lifestyle, original, scriptures, of, the, j, vika, school, of, philosophy, may, once, have, existed, but, these, are, currently, unavailable, and, probably, lost, their, theories, are, extracted, from, mentions, of, ajivikas, in, the, secondary, sources, of, ancient, indian, literature, particularly, those, of, jainism, and, buddhism, which, polemically, criticized, the, ajivikas, the, j, vika, school, is, known, for, its, niyati, doctrine, of, absolute, determinism, fate, the, premise, that, there, is, no, free, will, that, everything,
