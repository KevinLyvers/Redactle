being, one, of, the, largest, hindu, denominations, it, incorporates, many, sub, traditions, ranging, from, devotional, dualistic, theism, such, as, shaiva, siddhanta, to, yoga, orientated, monistic, non, theism, such, as, kashmiri, shaivism, it, considers, both, the, vedas, and, the, agama, texts, as, important, sources, of, theology, according, to, a, 2010, estimate, by, johnson, and, grim, shaivism, is, the, second, largest, hindu, sect, constituting, about, 252, million, or, 26, 6, of, hindus, shaivism, developed, as, an, amalgam, of, pre, vedic, religions, and, traditions, derived, from, the, southern, tamil, shaiva, siddhanta, traditions, and, philosophies, which, were, assimilated, in, the, non, vedic, shiva, tradition, in, the, process, of, sanskritisation, and, the, formation, of, hinduism, starting, in, the, last, centuries, bce, these, pre, vedic, traditions, became, aligned, with, the, vedic, deity, rudra, and, other, vedic, deities, incorporating, the, non, vedic, shiva, traditions, into, the, vedic, brahmanical, fold, both, devotional, and, monistic, shaivism, became, popular, in, the, 1st, millennium, ce, rapidly, becoming, the, dominant, religious, tradition, of, many, hindu, kingdoms, it, arrived, in, southeast, asia, shortly, thereafter, leading, to, the, construction, of, thousands, of, shaiva, temples, on, the, islands, of, indonesia, as, well, as, cambodia, and, vietnam, co, evolving, with, buddhism, in, these, regions, shaivite, theology, ranges, from, shiva, being, the, creator, preserver, and, destroyer, to, being, the, same, as, the, atman, self, within, oneself, and, every, living, being, it, is, closely, related, to, shaktism, and, some, shaivas, worship, in, both, shiva, and, shakti, temples, it, is, the, hindu, tradition, that, most, accepts, ascetic, life, and, emphasizes, yoga, and, like, other, hindu, traditions, encourages, an, individual, to, discover, and, be, one, with, shiva, within, the, followers, of, shaivism, are, called, shaivas, or, shaivites, shiva, iva, sanskrit, literally, means, kind, friendly, gracious, or, auspicious, as, a, proper, name, it, means, the, auspicious, one, the, word, shiva, is, used, as, an, adjective, in, the, rig, veda, as, an, epithet, for, several, rigvedic, deities, including, rudra, the, term, shiva, also, connotes, liberation, final, emancipation, and, the, auspicious, one, this, adjective, sense, of, usage, is, addressed, to, many, deities, in, vedic, layers, of, literature, the, term, evolved, from, the, vedic, rudra, shiva, to, the, noun, shiva, in, the, epics, and, the, puranas, as, an, auspicious, deity, who, is, the, creator, reproducer, and, dissolver, the, sanskrit, word, aiva, or, shaiva, means, relating, to, the, god, shiva, while, the, related, beliefs, practices, history, literature, and, sub, traditions, constitute, shaivism, the, reverence, for, shiva, is, one, of, the, pan, hindu, traditions, found, widely, across, south, asia, predominantly, in, southern, india, sri, lanka, and, nepal, while, shiva, is, revered, broadly, hinduism, itself, is, a, complex, religion, and, a, way, of, life, with, a, diversity, of, ideas, on, spirituality, and, traditions, it, has, no, ecclesiastical, order, no, unquestionable, religious, authorities, no, governing, body, no, prophet, s, nor, any, binding, holy, book, hindus, can, choose, to, be, polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or, humanist, shaivism, is, a, major, tradition, within, hinduism, with, a, theology, that, is, predominantly, related, to, the, hindu, god, shiva, shaivism, has, many, different, sub, traditions, with, regional, variations, and, differences, in, philosophy, shaivism, has, a, vast, literature, with, different, philosophical, schools, ranging, from, nondualism, dualism, and, mixed, schools, the, origins, of, shaivism, are, unclear, and, a, matter, of, debate, among, scholars, as, it, is, an, amalgam, of, pre, vedic, cults, and, traditions, and, vedic, culture, some, trace, the, origins, to, the, indus, valley, civilization, which, reached, its, peak, around, 2500, 2000, bce, archeological, discoveries, show, seals, that, suggest, a, deity, that, somewhat, appears, like, shiva, of, these, is, the, pashupati, seal, which, early, scholars, interpreted, as, someone, seated, in, a, meditating, yoga, pose, surrounded, by, animals, and, with, horns, this, pashupati, lord, of, animals, sanskrit, pa, upati, seal, has, been, interpreted, by, these, scholars, as, a, prototype, of, shiva, gavin, flood, characterizes, these, views, as, speculative, saying, that, it, is, not, clear, from, the, seal, if, the, figure, has, three, faces, or, is, seated, in, a, yoga, posture, or, even, that, the, shape, is, intended, to, represent, a, human, figure, other, scholars, state, that, the, indus, valley, script, remains, undeciphered, and, the, interpretation, of, the, pashupati, seal, is, uncertain, according, to, srinivasan, the, proposal, that, it, is, proto, shiva, may, be, a, case, of, projecting, later, practices, into, archeological, findings, similarly, asko, parpola, states, that, other, archaeological, finds, such, as, the, early, elamite, seals, dated, to, 3000, 2750, bce, show, similar, figures, and, these, have, been, interpreted, as, seated, bull, and, not, a, yogi, and, the, bull, interpretation, is, likely, more, accurate, the, rigveda, 1500, 1200, bce, has, the, earliest, clear, mention, of, rudra, roarer, in, its, hymns, 2, 33, 1, 43, and, 1, 114, the, text, also, includes, a, satarudriya, an, influential, hymn, with, embedded, hundred, epithets, for, rudra, that, is, cited, in, many, medieval, era, shaiva, texts, as, well, as, recited, in, major, shiva, temples, of, hindus, in, contemporary, times, yet, the, vedic, literature, only, present, scriptural, theology, but, does, not, attest, to, the, existence, of, shaivism, according, to, gavin, flood, the, formation, of, aiva, traditions, as, we, understand, them, begins, to, occur, during, the, period, from, 200, bc, to, 100, ad, shiva, was, originally, probably, not, a, brahmanical, god, but, eventually, came, to, be, incorporated, into, the, brahmanical, fold, the, pre, vedic, shiva, acquired, a, growing, prominence, as, its, cult, assimilated, numerous, ruder, faiths, and, their, mythologies, and, the, epics, and, puranas, preserve, pre, vedic, myths, and, legends, of, these, traditions, assimilated, by, the, shiva, cult, shiva, s, growing, prominence, was, facilitated, by, identification, with, a, number, of, vedic, deities, such, as, purusha, rudra, agni, indra, praj, pati, v, yu, among, others, the, followers, of, shiva, were, gradually, accepted, into, the, brahmanical, fold, becoming, allowed, to, recite, some, of, the, vedic, hymns, patanjali, s, mah, bh, ya, dated, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, mentions, the, term, shiva, bhagavata, in, section, 5, 2, 76, patanjali, while, explaining, panini, s, rules, of, grammar, states, that, this, term, refers, to, a, devotee, clad, in, animal, skins, and, carrying, an, ayah, sulikah, iron, spear, trident, lance, as, an, icon, representing, his, god, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, mentions, terms, such, as, rudra, shiva, and, maheshwaram, but, its, interpretation, as, a, theistic, or, monistic, text, of, shaivism, is, disputed, the, dating, of, the, shvetashvatara, is, also, in, dispute, but, it, is, likely, a, late, upanishad, the, mahabharata, mentions, shaiva, ascetics, such, as, in, chapters, 4, 13, and, 13, 140, other, evidence, that, is, possibly, linked, to, the, importance, of, shaivism, in, ancient, times, are, in, epigraphy, and, numismatics, such, as, in, the, form, of, prominent, shiva, like, reliefs, on, kushan, empire, era, gold, coins, however, this, is, controversial, as, an, alternate, hypothesis, for, these, reliefs, is, based, on, zoroastrian, oesho, according, to, flood, coins, dated, to, the, ancient, greek, saka, and, parthian, kings, who, ruled, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, after, the, arrival, of, alexander, the, great, also, show, shiva, iconography, however, this, evidence, is, weak, and, subject, to, competing, inferences, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, is, the, first, clear, evidence, of, p, upata, shaivism, the, inscriptions, found, in, the, himalayan, region, such, as, those, in, the, kathmandu, valley, of, nepal, suggest, that, shaivism, particularly, p, upata, was, established, in, this, region, by, the, 5th, century, during, the, late, guptas, era, these, inscriptions, have, been, dated, by, modern, techniques, to, between, 466, and, 645, ce, during, the, gupta, empire, c, 320, 500, ce, the, genre, of, pur, a, literature, developed, in, india, and, many, of, these, puranas, contain, extensive, chapters, on, shaivism, along, with, vaishnavism, shaktism, smarta, traditions, of, brahmins, and, other, topics, suggesting, the, importance, of, shaivism, by, then, the, most, important, shaiva, pur, as, of, this, period, include, the, shiva, pur, a, the, skanda, pur, a, and, the, linga, pur, a, most, of, the, gupta, kings, beginning, with, chandragupta, ii, vikramaditya, 375, 413, ce, were, known, as, parama, bhagavatas, or, bhagavata, vaishnavas, and, had, been, ardent, promoters, of, vaishnavism, but, following, the, huna, invasions, especially, those, of, the, alchon, huns, circa, 500, ce, the, gupta, empire, declined, and, fragmented, ultimately, collapsing, completely, with, the, effect, of, discrediting, vaishnavism, the, religion, it, had, been, so, ardently, promoting, the, newly, arising, regional, powers, in, central, and, northern, india, such, as, the, aulikaras, the, maukharis, the, maitrakas, the, kalacuris, or, the, vardhanas, preferred, adopting, shaivism, instead, giving, a, strong, impetus, to, the, development, of, the, worship, of, shiva, vaishnavism, remained, strong, mainly, in, the, territories, which, had, not, been, affected, by, these, events, south, india, and, kashmir, in, the, early, 7th, century, the, chinese, buddhist, pilgrim, xuanzang, huen, tsang, visited, india, and, wrote, a, memoir, in, chinese, that, mentions, the, prevalence, of, shiva, temples, all, over, north, indian, subcontinent, including, in, the, hindu, kush, region, such, as, nuristan, between, the, 5th, and, 11th, century, ce, major, shaiva, temples, had, been, built, in, central, southern, and, eastern, regions, of, the, subcontinent, including, those, at, badami, cave, temples, aihole, elephanta, caves, ellora, caves, kailasha, cave, 16, khajuraho, bhuvaneshwara, chidambaram, madurai, and, conjeevaram, major, scholars, of, competing, hindu, traditions, from, the, second, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, ce, such, as, adi, shankara, of, advaita, vedanta, and, ramanuja, of, vaishnavism, mention, several, shaiva, sects, particularly, the, four, groups, pashupata, lakulisha, tantric, shaiva, and, kapalika, the, description, is, conflicting, with, some, texts, stating, the, tantric, puranik, and, vedic, traditions, of, shaivism, to, be, hostile, to, each, other, while, others, suggest, them, to, be, amicable, sub, traditions, some, texts, state, that, kapalikas, reject, the, vedas, and, are, involved, in, extreme, experimentation, while, others, state, the, shaiva, sub, traditions, revere, the, vedas, but, are, non, puranik, shaivism, was, the, predominant, tradition, in, south, india, co, existing, with, buddhism, and, jainism, before, the, vaishnava, alvars, launched, the, bhakti, movement, in, the, 7th, century, and, influential, vedanta, scholars, such, as, ramanuja, developed, a, philosophical, and, organizational, framework, that, helped, vaishnavism, expand, though, both, traditions, of, hinduism, have, ancient, roots, given, their, mention, in, the, epics, such, as, the, mahabharata, shaivism, flourished, in, south, india, much, earlier, the, mantramarga, of, shaivism, according, to, alexis, sanderson, provided, a, template, for, the, later, though, independent, and, highly, influential, pancaratrika, treatises, of, vaishnavism, this, is, evidenced, in, hindu, texts, such, as, the, isvarasamhita, padmasamhita, and, paramesvarasamhita, along, with, the, himalayan, region, stretching, from, kashmir, through, nepal, the, shaiva, tradition, in, south, india, has, been, one, of, the, largest, sources, of, preserved, shaivism, related, manuscripts, from, ancient, and, medieval, india, the, region, was, also, the, source, of, hindu, arts, temple, architecture, and, merchants, who, helped, spread, shaivism, into, southeast, asia, in, early, 1st, millennium, ce, there, are, tens, of, thousands, of, hindu, temples, where, shiva, is, either, the, primary, deity, or, reverentially, included, in, anthropomorphic, or, aniconic, form, lingam, or, svayambhu, numerous, historic, shaiva, temples, have, survived, in, tamil, nadu, kerala, parts, of, andhra, pradesh, and, karnataka, gudimallam, is, the, oldest, known, lingam, and, has, been, dated, to, between, 3rd, to, 1st, century, bce, it, is, a, carved, five, feet, high, stone, lingam, with, an, anthropomorphic, image, of, shiva, on, one, side, this, ancient, lingam, is, in, chittoor, district, of, andhra, pradesh, shaivism, arrived, in, a, major, way, in, southeast, asia, from, south, india, and, to, much, lesser, extent, into, china, and, tibet, from, the, himalayan, region, it, co, developed, with, buddhism, in, this, region, in, many, cases, for, example, in, the, caves, of, the, thousand, buddhas, a, few, caves, include, shaivism, ideas, the, epigraphical, and, cave, arts, evidence, suggest, that, shaiva, mahesvara, and, mahayana, buddhism, had, arrived, in, indo, china, region, in, the, funan, period, that, is, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, ce, in, indonesia, temples, at, archaeological, sites, and, numerous, inscription, evidence, dated, to, the, early, period, 400, to, 700, ce, suggest, that, shiva, was, the, highest, god, this, co, existence, of, shaivism, and, buddhism, in, java, continued, through, about, 1500, ce, when, both, hinduism, and, buddhism, were, replaced, with, islam, and, persists, today, in, the, province, of, bali, the, shaivist, and, buddhist, traditions, overlapped, significantly, in, southeast, asia, particularly, in, indonesia, cambodia, and, vietnam, between, the, 5th, and, the, 15th, century, shaivism, and, shiva, held, the, paramount, position, in, ancient, java, sumatra, bali, and, neighboring, islands, though, the, sub, tradition, that, developed, creatively, integrated, more, ancient, beliefs, that, pre, existed, in, the, centuries, that, followed, the, merchants, and, monks, who, arrived, in, southeast, asia, brought, shaivism, vaishnavism, and, buddhism, and, these, developed, into, a, syncretic, mutually, supporting, form, of, traditions, in, balinese, hinduism, dutch, ethnographers, further, subdivided, siwa, shaivaites, sampradaya, into, five, kemenuh, keniten, mas, manuba, and, petapan, this, classification, was, to, accommodate, the, observed, marriage, between, higher, caste, brahmana, men, with, lower, caste, women, shaivism, centers, around, shiva, but, it, has, many, sub, traditions, whose, theological, beliefs, and, practices, vary, significantly, they, range, from, dualistic, devotional, theism, to, monistic, meditative, discovery, of, shiva, within, oneself, within, each, of, these, theologies, there, are, two, sub, groups, one, sub, group, is, called, vedic, puranic, who, use, the, terms, such, as, shiva, mahadeva, maheshvara, and, others, synonymously, and, they, use, iconography, such, as, the, linga, nandi, trishula, trident, as, well, as, anthropomorphic, statues, of, shiva, in, temples, to, help, focus, their, practices, another, sub, group, is, called, esoteric, which, fuses, it, with, abstract, sivata, feminine, energy, or, sivatva, neuter, abstraction, wherein, the, theology, integrates, the, goddess, shakti, and, the, god, shiva, with, tantra, practices, and, agama, teachings, there, is, a, considerable, overlap, between, these, shaivas, and, the, shakta, hindus, scholars, such, as, alexis, sanderson, discuss, shaivism, in, three, categories, vedic, puranik, and, non, puranik, esoteric, tantric, they, place, vedic, and, puranik, together, given, the, significant, overlap, while, placing, non, puranik, esoteric, sub, traditions, as, a, separate, category, shaivism, sub, traditions, subscribe, to, various, philosophies, are, similar, in, some, aspects, and, differ, in, others, these, traditions, compare, with, vaishnavism, shaktism, and, smartism, as, follows, shaiva, manuscripts, that, have, survived, post, 8th, century, nepal, and, himalayan, region, 140, 000, south, india, 8, 600, others, devanagiri, 2, 000, bali, and, se, asia, many, alexis, sanderson, the, saiva, literature, over, its, history, shaivism, has, been, nurtured, by, numerous, texts, ranging, from, scriptures, to, theological, treatises, these, include, the, vedas, and, upanishads, the, agamas, and, the, bhasya, according, to, gavin, flood, a, professor, at, oxford, university, specializing, in, shaivism, and, phenomenology, shaiva, scholars, developed, a, sophisticated, theology, in, its, diverse, traditions, among, the, notable, and, influential, commentaries, by, dvaita, dualistic, theistic, shaivism, scholars, were, the, 8th, century, sadyajoti, the, 10th, century, ramakantha, 11th, century, bhojadeva, the, dualistic, theology, was, challenged, by, the, numerous, scholars, of, advaita, nondualistic, monistic, shaivism, persuasion, such, as, the, 8th, 9th, century, vasugupta, the, 10th, century, abhinavagupta, and, 11th, century, kshemaraja, particularly, the, scholars, of, the, pratyabhijna, spanda, and, kashmiri, shaivism, schools, of, theologians, the, vedas, and, upanishads, are, shared, scriptures, of, hinduism, while, the, agamas, are, sacred, texts, of, specific, sub, traditions, the, surviving, vedic, literature, can, be, traced, to, the, 1st, millennium, bce, and, earlier, while, the, surviving, agamas, can, be, traced, to, 1st, millennium, of, the, common, era, the, vedic, literature, in, shaivism, is, primary, and, general, while, agamas, are, special, treatise, in, terms, of, philosophy, and, spiritual, precepts, no, agama, that, goes, against, the, vedic, literature, states, mariasusai, dhavamony, will, be, acceptable, to, the, shaivas, according, to, david, smith, a, key, feature, of, the, tamil, saiva, siddhanta, one, might, almost, say, its, defining, feature, is, the, claim, that, its, source, lies, in, the, vedas, as, well, as, the, agamas, in, what, it, calls, the, vedagamas, this, school, s, view, can, be, summed, as, the, veda, is, the, cow, the, true, agama, its, milk, the, vet, vatara, upanishad, 400, 200, bce, is, the, earliest, textual, exposition, of, a, systematic, philosophy, of, shaivism, shaivism, inspired, scholars, authored, 14, shiva, focussed, upanishads, that, are, called, the, shaiva, upanishads, these, are, considered, part, of, 95, minor, upanishads, in, the, muktik, upanishadic, corpus, of, hindu, literature, the, earliest, among, these, were, likely, composed, in, 1st, millennium, bce, while, the, last, ones, in, the, late, medieval, era, the, shaiva, upanishads, present, diverse, ideas, ranging, from, bhakti, style, theistic, dualism, themes, to, a, synthesis, of, shaiva, ideas, with, advaitic, nondualism, yoga, vaishnava, and, shakti, themes, the, agama, texts, of, shaivism, are, another, important, foundation, of, shaivism, theology, these, texts, include, shaiva, cosmology, epistemology, philosophical, doctrines, precepts, on, meditation, and, practices, four, kinds, of, yoga, mantras, meanings, and, manuals, for, shaiva, temples, and, other, elements, of, practice, these, canonical, texts, exist, in, sanskrit, and, in, south, indian, languages, such, as, tamil, the, agamas, present, a, diverse, range, of, philosophies, ranging, from, theistic, dualism, to, absolute, monism, in, shaivism, there, are, ten, dualistic, dvaita, agama, texts, eighteen, qualified, monism, cum, dualism, bhedabheda, agama, texts, and, sixty, four, monism, advaita, agama, texts, the, bhairava, shastras, are, monistic, while, shiva, shastras, are, dualistic, the, agama, texts, of, shaiva, and, vaishnava, schools, are, premised, on, existence, of, atman, self, and, the, existence, of, an, ultimate, reality, brahman, which, is, considered, identical, to, shiva, in, shaivism, the, texts, differ, in, the, relation, between, the, two, some, assert, the, dualistic, philosophy, of, the, individual, self, and, ultimate, reality, being, different, while, others, state, a, oneness, between, the, two, kashmir, shaiva, agamas, posit, absolute, oneness, that, is, god, shiva, is, within, man, god, is, within, every, being, god, is, present, everywhere, in, the, world, including, all, non, living, beings, and, there, is, no, spiritual, difference, between, life, matter, man, and, god, while, agamas, present, diverse, theology, in, terms, of, philosophy, and, spiritual, precepts, no, agama, that, goes, against, the, vedic, literature, states,

theistic, dualism, nontheistic, monism, and, those, that, combine, features, or, practices, of, the, two, sanderson, presents, the, historic, classification, found, in, indian, texts, namely, atimarga, of, the, shaiva, monks, and, mantramarga, that, was, followed, by, both, the, renunciates, sannyasi, and, householders, grihastha, in, shaivism, sub, traditions, of, shaivas, did, not, exclusively, focus, on, shiva, but, others, such, as, the, devi, goddess, shaktism, the, atimarga, branch, of, shaivism, emphasizes, liberation, salvation, or, the, end, of, all, dukkha, as, the, primary, goal, of, spiritual, pursuits, it, was, the, path, for, shaiva, ascetics, in, contrast, to, shaiva, householders, whose, path, was, described, as, mantramarga, and, who, sought, both, salvation, as, well, as, the, yogi, siddhi, powers, and, pleasures, in, life, the, atimarga, revered, the, vedic, sources, of, shaivism, and, sometimes, referred, to, in, ancient, indian, texts, as, raudra, from, vedic, rudra, pashupata, iast, p, upatas, are, the, shaivite, sub, tradition, with, the, oldest, heritage, as, evidenced, by, indian, texts, dated, to, around, the, start, of, the, common, era, it, is, a, monist, tradition, that, considers, shiva, to, be, within, oneself, in, every, being, and, everything, observed, the, pashupata, path, to, liberation, is, one, of, asceticism, that, is, traditionally, restricted, to, brahmin, males, pashupata, theology, according, to, shiva, sutras, aims, for, a, spiritual, state, of, consciousness, where, the, pashupata, yogi, abides, in,

pashupatas, derive, their, sanskrit, name, from, two, words, pashu, beast, and, pati, lord, where, the, chaotic, and, ignorant, state, one, imprisoned, by, bondage, and, assumptions, is, conceptualized, as, the, beast, and, the, atman, self, shiva, that, is, present, eternally, everywhere, as, the, pati, the, tradition, aims, at, realizing, the, state, of, being, one, with, shiva, within, and, everywhere, it, has, extensive, literature, and, a, fivefold, path, of, spiritual, practice, that, starts, with, external, practices, evolving, into, internal, practices, and, ultimately, meditative, yoga, with, the, aim, of, overcoming, all, suffering, dukkha, and, reaching, the, state, of, bliss, ananda, the, tradition, is, attributed, to, a, sage, from, gujarat, named, lakulisha, 2nd, century, ce, he, is, the, purported, author, of, the, pashupata, sutra, a, foundational, text, of, this, tradition, other, texts, include, the, bhasya, commentary, on, pashupata, sutra, by,

vasugupta, and, his, ideas, about, spanda, have, also, been, influential, to, this, and, other, shaiva, sub, traditions, but, it, is, probable, that, much, older, shaiva, texts, once, existed, a, notable, feature, of, kashmir, shaivism, was, its, openness, and, integration, of, ideas, from, shaktism, vaishnavism, and, vajrayana, buddhism, for, example, one, sub, tradition, of, kashmir, shaivism, adopts, goddess, worship, shaktism, by, stating, that, the, approach, to, god, shiva, is, through, goddess, shakti, this, tradition, combined, monistic, ideas, with, tantric, practices,

the, goddess, shakti, regularly, the, denominations, of, hinduism, states, julius, lipner, are, unlike, those, found, in, major, religions, of, the, world, because, hindu, denominations, are, fuzzy,

from, the, late, 6th, century, onwards, particularly, the, khmer, and, cham, kingdoms, of, indochina, and, across, the, major, islands, of, indonesia, such, as, sumatra, java, and, bali, this, influence, on, classical, cambodia, vietnam, and, thailand, continued, when, mahayana, buddhism, arrived, with, the, same, indians, in, shaivism, of, indonesia, the, popular, name, for, shiva, has, been, bhattara, guru, which, is, derived, from, sanskrit, bhattaraka, which, means, noble, lord, he, is, conceptualized, as, a, kind, spiritual, teacher, the, first, of, all, gurus, in, indonesian, hindu, texts, mirroring, the, dakshinamurti, aspect, of, shiva, in, the, indian, subcontinent, however, the, bhattara, guru, has, more, aspects, than, the, indian, shiva, as, the, indonesian, hindus, blended, their, spirits, and, heroes, with, him, bhattara, guru, s, wife, in, southeast, asia, is, the, same, hindu, deity, durga, who, has, been, popular, since, ancient, times, and, she, too, has, a, complex, character, with, benevolent, and, fierce, manifestations, each, visualized, with, different, names, such, as, uma, sri, kali, and, others, shiva, has, been, called, sadasiva, paramasiva, mahadeva, in, benevolent, forms, and, kala, bhairava, mahakala, in, his, fierce, forms, the, indonesian, hindu, texts, present, the, same, philosophical, diversity, of, shaivism, traditions, found, on, the, subcontinent, however, among, the, texts, that, have, survived, into, the, contemporary, era, the, more, common, are, of, those, of, shaiva, siddhanta, locally, also, called, siwa, siddhanta, sridanta, as, bhakti, movement, ideas, spread, in, south, india, shaivite, devotionalism, became, a, potent, movement, in, karnataka, and, tamil, nadu, shaivism, was, adopted, by, several, ruling, hindu, dynasties, as, the, state, religion, though, other, hindu, traditions, buddhism, and, jainism, continued, in, parallel, including, the, chola, nayaks, lingayats, and, the, rajputs, a, similar, trend, was, witnessed, in, early, medieval, indonesia, with, the, majapahit, empire, and, pre, islamic, malaya, in, the, himalayan, hindu, kingdom, of, nepal, shaivism, remained, a, popular, form, of, hinduism, and, co, evolved, with, mahayana, and, vajrayana, buddhism, the, goddess, tradition, of, hinduism, called, shaktism, is, closely, related, to, shaivism, in, many, regions, of, india, not, only, did, the, ideas, of, shaivism, influence, the, evolution, of, shaktism, but, shaivism, also, itself, was, influenced, by, it, and, progressively, subsumed, the, reverence, for, the, divine, feminine, devi, as, an, equal, and, essential, partner, of, divine, masculine, shiva, the, goddess, shakti, in, eastern, states, of, india, is, considered, the, inseparable, partner, of, god, shiva, according, to, galvin, flood, the, closeness, between, shaivism, and, shaktism, traditions, is, such, that, these, traditions, of, hinduism, are, at, times, difficult, to, separate, some, shaiva, worship, in, shiva, and, shakti, temples, shiva, is, a, part, of, the, smarta, tradition, sometimes, referred, to, as, smartism, another, tradition, of, hinduism, the, smarta, hindus, are, associated, with, the, advaita, vedanta, theology, and, their, practices, include, an, interim, step, that, incorporates, simultaneous, reverence, for, five, deities, which, includes, shiva, along, with, vishnu, surya, devi, and, ganesha, this, is, called, the, panchayatana, puja, the, smartas, thus, accept, the, primary, deity, of, shaivism, as, a, means, to, their, spiritual, goals, philosophically, the, smarta, tradition, emphasizes, that, all, idols, murti, are, icons, of, saguna, brahman, a, means, to, realizing, the, abstract, ultimate, reality, called, nirguna, brahman, the, five, or, six, icons, are, seen, by, smartas, as, multiple, representations, of, the, one, saguna, brahman, i, e, a, personal, god, with, form, rather, than, as, distinct, beings, the, ultimate, goal, in, this, practice, is, to, transition, past, the, use, of, icons, then, follow, a, philosophical, and, meditative, path, to, understanding, the, oneness, of, atman, self, and, brahman, metaphysical, ultimate, reality, as, that, art, thou, panchayatana, puja, that, incorporates, shiva, became, popular, in, medieval, india, and, is, attributed, to, 8th, century, adi, shankara, but, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, this, practice, long, predates, the, birth, of, adi, shankara, many, panchayatana, mandalas, and, temples, have, been, uncovered, that, are, from, the, gupta, empire, period, and, one, panchayatana, set, from, the, village, of, nand, about, 24, kilometers, from, ajmer, has, been, dated, to, belong, to, the, kushan, empire, era, pre, 300, ce, according, to, james, harle, major, hindu, temples, from, 1st, millennium, ce, commonly, embedded, the, pancayatana, architecture, from, odisha, to, karnataka, to, kashmir, large, temples, often, present, multiple, deities, in, the, same, temple, complex, while, some, explicitly, include, dual, representations, of, deities, such, as, harihara, half, shiva, half, vishnu, vaishnava, texts, reverentially, mention, shiva, for, example, the, vishnu, purana, primarily, focuses, on, the, theology, of, hindu, god, vishnu, and, his, avatars, such, as, krishna, but, it, praises, brahma, and, shiva, and, asserts, that, they, are, one, with, vishnu, the, vishnu, sahasranama, in, the, mahabharata, list, a, thousand, attributes, and, epithets, of, vishnu, the, list, identifies, shiva, with, vishnu, reverential, inclusion, of, shaiva, ideas, and, iconography, are, very, common, in, major, vaishnava, temples, such, as, dakshinamurti, symbolism, of, shaiva, thought, is, often, enshrined, on, the, southern, wall, of, the, main, temple, of, major, vaishnava, temples, in, peninsular, india, harihara, temples, in, and, outside, the, indian, subcontinent, have, historically, combined, shiva, and, vishnu, such, as, at, the, lingaraj, mahaprabhu, temple, in, bhubaneshwar, odisha, according, to, julius, lipner, vaishnavism, traditions, such, as, sri, vaishnavism, embrace, shiva, ganesha, and, others, not, as, distinct, deities, of, polytheism, but, as, polymorphic, manifestation, of, the, same, supreme, divine, principle, providing, the, devotee, a, polycentric, access, to, the, spiritual, similarly, shaiva, traditions, have, reverentially, embraced, other, gods, and, goddesses, as, manifestation, of, the, same, divine, the, skanda, purana, for, example, in, section, 6, 254, 100, states, he, who, is, shiva, is, vishnu, he, who, is, vishnu, is, sadashiva, the, sun, god, called, surya, is, an, ancient, deity, of, hinduism, and, several, ancient, hindu, kingdoms, particularly, in, the, northwest, and, eastern, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, revered, surya, these, devotees, called, sauras, once, had, a, large, corpus, of, theological, texts, and, shaivism, literature, reverentially, acknowledges, these, for, example, the, shaiva, text, srikanthiyasamhita, mentions, 85, saura, texts, almost, all, of, which, are, believed, to, have, been, lost, during, the, islamic, invasion, and, rule, period, except, for, large, excerpts, found, embedded, in, shaiva, manuscripts, discovered, in, the, himalayan, mountains, shaivism, incorporated, saura, ideas, and, the, surviving, saura, manuscripts, such, as, saurasamhita, acknowledge, the, influence, of, shaivism, according, to, alexis, sanderson, assigning, itself, to, the, canon, of, shaiva, text, vathula, kalottara, yoga, and, meditation, have, been, an, integral, part, of, shaivism, and, it, has, been, a, major, innovator, of, techniques, such, as, those, of, hatha, yoga, many, major, shiva, temples, and, shaiva, tritha, pilgrimage, centers, as, well, as, shaiva, texts, depict, anthropomorphic, iconography, of, shiva, as, a, giant, statue, wherein, shiva, is, a, lone, yogi, meditating, in, several, shaiva, traditions, such, as, the, kashmir, shaivism, anyone, who, seeks, personal, understanding, and, spiritual, growth, has, been, called, a, yogi, the, shiva, sutras, aphorisms, of, shaivism, teach, yoga, in, many, forms, according, to, mark, dyczkowski, yoga, which, literally, means, union, to, this, tradition, has, meant, the, realisation, of, our, true, inherent, nature, which, is, inherently, greater, than, our, thoughts, can, ever, conceive, and, that, the, goal, of, yoga, is, to, be, the, free, eternal, blissful, perfect, infinite, spiritually, conscious, one, is, many, yoga, emphasizing, shaiva,

the, shaiva, link, to, the, performance, arts, is, celebrated, in, indian, classical, dances, such, as, bharatanatyam, and, chhau, buddhism, and, shaivism, have, interacted, and, influenced, each, other, since, ancient, times, in, south, asia, southeast, asia, and, east, asia, their, siddhas, and, esoteric, traditions, in, particular, have, overlapped, to, an, extent, where, buddhists, and, hindus, worshipped, in, the, same, temple, such, as, in, the, seto, machindranath, in, southeast, asia, the, two, traditions, were, not, presented, in, competitive, or, polemical, terms, rather, as, two, alternate, paths, that, lead, to, the, same, goals, of, liberation, with, theologians, disagreeing, which, of, these, is, faster, and, simpler, scholars, disagree, whether, a, syncretic, tradition, emerged, from, buddhism, and, shaivism, or, it, was, a, coalition, with, free, borrowing, of, ideas, but, they, agree, that, the, two, traditions, co, existed, peacefully, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, close, relationship, between, shaivism, and, buddhism, comes, from, the, archaeological, sites, and, damaged, sculptures, from, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, such, as, gandhara, these, are, dated, to, about, the, 1st, century, ce, with, shiva, depicted, in, buddhist, arts, the, buddhist, avalokiteshvara, is, linked, to, shiva, in, many, of, these, arts, but, in, others, shiva, is, linked, to, bodhisattva, maitreya, with, him, shown, as, carrying, his, own, water, pot, like, vedic, priests, according, to, richard, blurton, the, ancient, works, show, that, the, bodhisattva, of, compassion, in, buddhism, has, many, features, in, common, with, shiva, in, shaivism, the, shaiva, hindu, and, buddhist, syncretism, continues, in, the, contemporary, era, in, the, island, of, bali, indonesia, in, central, asian, buddhism, and, its, historic, arts, syncretism, and, a, shared, expression, of, shaivism, buddhism, and, tantra, themes, has, been, common, this, is, evdient, in, the, kizil, caves, in, xinjiang, where, there, are, numerous, caves, that, depict, shiva, in, the, buddhist, shrines, through, wall, paintings, the, syncretism, between, buddhism, and, shaivism, was, particularly, marked, in, southeast, asia, but, this, was, not, unique, rather, it, was, a, common, phenomenon, also, observed, in, the, eastern, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, south, and, the, himalayan, regions, this, tradition, continues, in, predominantly, hindu, bali, indonesia, in, the, modern, era, where, buddha, is, considered, the, younger, brother, of, shiva, in, the, pre, islamic, java, shaivism, and, buddhism, were, considered, very, close, and, allied, religions, though, not, identical, religions, this, idea, is, also, found, in, the, sculptures, and,

shaiva, goddesses, into, jaina, goddess, is, more, transparent, than, a, similar, connection, between, shaivism, and, buddhism, the, 11th, century, jain, text, bhairavapadmavatikalpa, for, example, equates, padmavati, of, jainism, with, tripura, bhairavi, of, shaivism, and, shaktism, among, the, major, goddesses, of, jainism, that, are, rooted, in, hindu, pantheon, particularly, shaiva, include,

and, a, naked, bhairava, while, shaiva, and, jain, practices, had, considerable, overlap, the, interaction, between, the, jain, community, and, shaiva, community, differed, on, the, acceptance, of,
