shia, islam, i, or, shi, a, islam, is, the, second, largest, branch, of, islam, it, holds, that, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, designated, ali, ibn, abi, talib, 656, 661, ce, as, his, successor, arabic, romanized, khalifa, and, the, imam, arabic, lit, spiritual, and, political, leader, after, him, most, notably, at, the, event, of, ghadir, khumm, but, was, prevented, from, succeeding, muhammad, as, the, leader, of, the, muslims, as, a, result, of, the, choice, made, by, some, of, muhammad, s, other, companions, arabic, romanized, sahaba, at, saqifah, this, view, primarily, contrasts, with, that, of, sunni, islam, whose, adherents, believe, that, muhammad, did, not, appoint, a, successor, before, his, death, and, consider, abu, bakr, who, was, appointed, caliph, by, a, group, of, muhammad, s, other, companions, at, saqifah, to, be, the, first, rightful, rashidun, caliph, after, muhammad, 632, 634, ce, adherents, of, shia, islam, are, called, shia, muslims, shia, muslims, belief, that, ali, was, the, designated, successor, to, muhammad, as, islam, s, spiritual, and, political, leader, later, developed, into, the, concept, of, imamah, the, idea, that, certain, descendants, of, muhammad, the, ahl, al, bayt, arabic, lit, people, of, the, house, are, rightful, rulers, or, imams, through, the, bloodline, of, ali, and, his, two, sons, hasan, and, husayn, whom, shia, muslims, believe, possess, special, spiritual, and, political, authority, over, the, muslim, community, later, events, such, as, husayn, ibn, ali, s, martyrdom, in, the, battle, of, karbala, 680, ce, further, influenced, the, development, of, shia, islam, contributing, to, the, formation, of, a, distinct, religious, sect, with, its, own, rituals, and, shared, collective, memory, shia, islam, is, followed, by, 10, 15, of, all, muslims, although, there, are, many, shia, subsects, in, the, muslim, world, twelver, shi, ism, is, by, far, the, largest, and, most, influential, comprising, about, 85, of, all, shia, muslims, others, include, the, isma, ili, zaydi, and, alevi, shia, muslims, form, a, majority, of, the, population, in, four, countries, across, the, muslim, world, iran, iraq, azerbaijan, and, bahrain, significant, shiite, communities, are, also, found, in, lebanon, kuwait, turkey, yemen, and, the, indian, subcontinent, iran, stands, as, the, world, s, only, country, where, shia, islam, forms, the, foundation, of, both, its, laws, and, governance, system, the, word, shia, derives, from, the, arabic, term, sh, at, al, arabic, meaning, partisans, of, ali, followers, of, ali, or, faction, of, ali, sh, arabic, i, i, denotes, both, the, singular, noun, and, the, adjective, form, while, sh, iyy, n, refers, to, the, plural, noun, shia, or, sh, a, i, shiism, sh, ism, i, z, m, and, shiite, sh, ite, i, a, t, are, the, forms, used, in, english, and, other, european, languages, for, adherents, mosques, traditions, and, things, associated, with, the, shia, branch, of, islam, the, term, shia, was, first, used, during, muhammad, s, lifetime, at, present, the, word, refers, to, the, muslims, who, believe, that, the, leadership, of, the, muslim, community, after, muhammad, belongs, to, al, ibn, ab, lib, muhammad, s, cousin, and, son, in, law, and, his, successors, nawbakhti, states, that, the, term, shia, refers, to, a, group, of, muslims, who, at, the, time, of, muhammad, and, after, him, regarded, al, as, the, imam, and, caliph, al, shahrastani, expresses, that, the, term, shia, refers, to, those, who, believe, that, al, is, designated, as, the, heir, imam, and, caliph, by, muhammad, and, that, al, s, authority, is, maintained, through, his, descendants, for, the, adherents, of, shia, islam, this, conviction, is, implicit, in, the, quran, and, the, history, of, islam, shia, muslim, scholars, emphasize, that, the, notion, of, authority, is, linked, to, the, family, of, the, abrahamic, prophets, as, the, quranic, verses, 3, 33, and, 3, 34, show, indeed, allah, chose, adam, noah, the, family, of, abraham, and, the, family, of, imr, n, above, all, people, they, are, descendants, of, one, another, and, allah, is, all, hearing, all, knowing, sh, a, islam, encompasses, various, denominations, and, subgroups, all, bound, by, the, belief, that, the, leader, of, the, muslim, community, ummah, should, hail, from, ahl, al, bayt, the, family, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, it, embodies, a, completely, independent, system, of, religious, interpretation, and, political, authority, in, the, muslim, world, sh, a, muslims, believe, that, just, as, a, prophet, is, appointed, by, god, alone, only, god, has, the, prerogative, to, appoint, the, successor, to, his, prophet, they, believe, god, chose, al, ibn, ab, lib, to, be, muhammad, s, successor, and, the, first, caliph, arabic, romanized, khalifa, of, islam, sh, a, muslims, believe, that, muhammad, designated, ali, as, his, successor, by, god, s, command, on, several, instances, but, most, notably, at, eid, al, ghadir, additionally, al, was, muhammad, s, first, cousin, and, closest, living, male, relative, as, well, as, his, son, in, law, having, married, muhammad, s, daughter, f, imah, the, sh, te, version, of, the, shahada, arabic, the, islamic, profession, of, faith, differs, from, that, of, the, sunn, s, the, sunn, version, of, the, shahada, states, la, ilaha, illallah, muhammadun, rasulullah, arabic, lit, there, is, no, god, except, god, muhammad, is, the, messenger, of, god, but, in, addition, to, this, declaration, of, faith, sh, a, muslims, add, the, phrase, ali, un, waliullah, arabic, lit, ali, is, the, guardian, of, god, the, basis, for, the, sh, te, belief, in, al, ibn, ab, lib, as, the, wali, of, god, is, derived, from, the, qur, anic, verse, 5, 55, this, additional, phrase, to, the, declaration, of, faith, embodies, the, sh, te, emphasis, on, the, inheritance, of, authority, through, muhammad, s, family, and, lineage, the, three, clauses, of, the, sh, te, version, of, the, shahada, thus, address, the, fundamental, islamic, beliefs, of, taw, d, arabic, lit, oneness, of, god, nubuwwah, arabic, lit, prophethood, and, imamah, arabic, lit, imamate, or, leadership, ismah, arabic, romanized, i, mah, or, isma, lit, protection, is, the, concept, of, infallibility, or, divinely, bestowed, freedom, from, error, and, sin, in, islam, muslims, believe, that, muhammad, along, with, the, other, prophets, and, messengers, possessed, ismah, twelver, and, ism, l, sh, a, muslims, also, attribute, the, quality, to, imams, as, well, as, to, f, imah, daughter, of, muhammad, in, contrast, to, the, zayd, sh, as, who, do, not, attribute, ismah, to, the, imams, though, initially, beginning, as, a, political, movement, infallibility, and, sinlessness, of, the, imams, later, evolved, as, a, distinct, belief, of, non, zayd, sh, sm, according, to, sh, a, muslim, theologians, infallibility, is, considered, a, rational, necessary, precondition, for, spiritual, and, religious, guidance, they, argue, that, since, god, has, commanded, absolute, obedience, from, these, figures, they, must, only, order, that, which, is, right, the, state, of, infallibility, is, based, on, the, sh, te, interpretation, of, the, verse, of, purification, thus, they, are, the, most, pure, ones, the, only, immaculate, ones, preserved, from, and, immune, to, all, uncleanness, it, does, not, mean, that, supernatural, powers, prevent, them, from, committing, a, sin, but, due, to, the, fact, that, they, have, absolute, belief, in, god, they, refrain, from, doing, anything, that, is, a, sin, they, also, have, a, complete, knowledge, of, god, s, will, they, are, in, possession, of, all, knowledge, brought, by, the, angels, arabic, romanized, mal, ikah, to, the, prophets, arabic, romanized, anbiy, and, the, messengers, arabic, romanized, rusul, their, knowledge, encompasses, the, totality, of, all, times, thus, they, are, believed, to, act, without, fault, in, religious, matters, shi, a, muslims, regard, al, ibn, ab, lib, as, the, successor, of, muhammad, not, only, ruling, over, the, entire, muslim, community, in, justice, but, also, in, interpreting, the, islamic, faith, practices, and, its, esoteric, meaning, al, is, regarded, as, a, perfect, man, arabic, romanized, al, insan, al, kamil, similar, to, muhammad, according, to, the, sh, te, perspective, the, occultation, is, an, eschatological, belief, held, in, various, denominations, of, sh, a, islam, concerning, a, messianic, figure, the, hidden, and, last, imam, known, as, the, mahdi, that, one, day, shall, return, on, earth, and, fill, the, world, with, justice, according, to, the, doctrine, of, twelver, sh, sm, the, main, goal, of, imam, mahdi, will, be, to, establish, an, islamic, state, and, to, apply, islamic, laws, that, were, revealed, to, muhammad, the, quran, does, not, contain, verses, on, the, imamate, which, is, the, basic, doctrine, of, sh, a, islam, some, sh, a, subsects, such, as, the, zayd, sh, as, and, niz, r, ism, l, s, do, not, believe, in, the, idea, of, the, occultation, the, groups, which, do, believe, in, it, differ, as, to, which, lineage, of, the, imamate, is, valid, and, therefore, which, individual, has, gone, into, occultation, they, believe, there, are, many, signs, that, will, indicate, the, time, of, his, return, twelver, sh, a, muslims, believe, that, the, prophesied, mahdi, and, 12th, sh, te, imam, hujjat, allah, al, mahdi, is, already, on, earth, in, occultation, and, will, return, at, the, end, of, time, ayyibi, ism, l, s, and, fatimid, bohra, dawoodi, bohra, believe, the, same, but, for, their, 21st, ayyib, at, tayyib, abi, l, qasim, and, also, believe, that, a, da, i, al, mutlaq, unrestricted, missionary, maintains, contact, with, him, sunn, muslims, believe, that, the, future, mahdi, has, not, yet, arrived, on, earth, sh, a, muslims, believe, that, the, status, of, al, is, supported, by, numerous, ad, th, reports, including, the, hadith, of, the, pond, of, khumm, hadith, of, the, two, weighty, things, hadith, of, the, pen, and, paper, hadith, of, the, invitation, of, the, close, families, and, hadith, of, the, twelve, successors, in, particular, the, hadith, of, the, cloak, is, often, quoted, to, illustrate, muhammad, s, feeling, towards, al, and, his, family, by, both, sunn, and, shia, scholars, shia, muslims, prefer, to, study, and, read, the, hadith, attributed, to, the, ahl, al, bayt, and, close, associates, and, most, have, their, own, separate, hadith, canon, sh, a, muslims, believe, that, the, armaments, and, sacred, items, of, all, of, the, abrahamic, prophets, including, muhammad, were, handed, down, in, succession, to, the, imams, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, ja, far, al, diq, the, 6th, sh, te, imam, in, kitab, al, kafi, mentions, that, with, me, are, the, arms, of, the, messenger, of, allah, it, is, not, disputable, further, he, claims, that, with, him, is, the, sword, of, the, messenger, of, god, his, coat, of, arms, his, lamam, pennon, and, his, helmet, in, addition, he, mentions, that, with, him, is, the, flag, of, the, messenger, of, god, the, victorious, with, him, is, the, staff, of, moses, the, ring, of, solomon, son, of, david, and, the, tray, on, which, moses, used, to, offer, his, offerings, with, him, is, the, name, that, whenever, the, messenger, of, god, would, place, it, between, the, muslims, and, pagans, no, arrow, from, the, pagans, would, reach, the, muslims, with, him, is, the, similar, object, that, angels, brought, al, diq, also, narrated, that, the, passing, down, of, armaments, is, synonymous, to, receiving, the, imamat, leadership, similar, to, how, the, ark, of, covenant, in, the, house, of, the, israelites, signaled, prophethood, imam, ali, al, ridha, narrates, that, wherever, the, armaments, among, us, would, go, knowledge, would, also, follow, and, the, armaments, would, never, depart, from, those, with, knowledge, imamat, according, to, muhammad, rida, al, muzaffar, god, gives, humans, the, faculty, of, reason, and, argument, also, god, orders, humans, to, spend, time, thinking, carefully, on, creation, while, he, refers, to, all, creations, as, his, signs, of, power, and, glory, these, signs, encompass, all, of, the, universe, furthermore, there, is, a, similarity, between, humans, as, the, little, world, and, the, universe, as, the, large, world, god, does, not, accept, the, faith, of, those, who, follow, him, without, thinking, and, only, with, imitation, but, also, god, blames, them, for, such, actions, in, other, words, humans, have, to, think, about, the, universe, with, reason, and, intellect, a, faculty, bestowed, on, us, by, god, since, there, is, more, insistence, on, the, faculty, of, intellect, among, shia, muslims, even, evaluating, the, claims, of, someone, who, claims, prophecy, is, on, the, basis, of, intellect, shia, religious, practices, such, as, prayers, differ, only, slightly, from, the, sunn, s, while, all, muslims, pray, five, times, daily, shia, muslims, have, the, option, of, combining, dhuhr, with, asr, and, maghrib, with, isha, as, there, are, three, distinct, times, mentioned, in, the, quran, the, sunn, s, tend, to, combine, only, under, certain, circumstances, shia, muslims, celebrate, the, following, annual, holidays, after, mecca, and, medina, the, two, holiest, cities, of, islam, the, cities, of, najaf, karbala, mashhad, and, qom, are, the, most, revered, by, sh, a, muslims, the, sanctuary, of, im, m,

orthodoxy, particularly, in, twelver, shi, ism, has, considered, non, muslims, as, agents, of, impurity, naj, sat, this, categorization, sometimes, extends, to, kit, b, individuals, belonging, to, the, people, of, the, book, with, jews, explicitly, labeled, as, impure, by, certain, shia, religious, scholars, armenians, in, iran, who, have, historically, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, iranian, economy, received, relatively, more, lenient, treatment, shi, ite, theologians, and, mujtahids, jurists, such, as, mu, ammad, b, qir, al, majlis, held, that, jews, impurity, extended, to, the, point, where, they, were, advised, to, stay, at, home, on, rainy, or, snowy, days, to, prevent, contaminating, their, shia, neighbors, ayatollah, khomeini, supreme, leader, of, iran, from, 1979, to, 1989, asserted, that, every, part, of, an, unbeliever, s, body, including, hair, nails, and, bodily, secretions, is, impure, however, the, current, leader, of, iran, al, khamene, stated, in, a, fatwa, that, jews, and, other, peoples, of, the, book, are, not, inherently, impure, and, touching, the, moisture, on, their, hands, does, not, convey, impurity, the, original, shia, identity, referred, to, the, followers, of, imam, al, and, shia, theology, was, formulated, after, the, hijra, 8th, century, ce, the, first, shia, governments, and, societies, were, established, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, ce, the, 10th, century, ce, has, been, referred, to, by, the, scholar, of, islamic, studies, louis, massignon, as, the, shiite, ismaili, century, in, the, history, of, islam, the, shia, originally, known, as, the, partisans, of, al, ibn, ab, lib, muhammad, s, cousin, and, fatima, s, husband, first, emerged, as, a, distinct, movement, during, the, first, fitna, from, 656, to, 661, ce, shia, doctrine, holds, that, al, was, meant, to, lead, the, community, after, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, historians, dispute, over, the, origins, of, shia, islam, with, many, western, scholars, positing, that, sh, sm, began, as, a, political, faction, rather, than, a, truly, religious, movement, other, scholars, disagree, considering, this, concept, of, religious, political, separation, to, be, an, anachronistic, application, of, a, western, concept, shia, muslims, believe, that, muhammad, designated, al, ibn, ab, lib, as, his, heir, during, a, speech, at, ghadir, khumm, the, point, of, contention, between, different, muslim, sects, arises, when, muhammad, whilst, giving, his, speech, gave, the, proclamation, anyone, who, has, me, as, his, mawla, has, al, as, his, mawla, some, versions, add, the, additional, sentence, o, god, befriend, the, friend, of, al, and, be, the, enemy, of, his, enemy, sunnis, maintain, that, muhammad, emphasized, the, deserving, friendship, and, respect, for, al, in, contrast, shia, muslims, assert, that, the, statement, unequivocally, designates, al, as, muhammad, s, appointed, successor, shia, sources, also, record, further, details, of, the, event, such, as, stating, that, those, present, congratulated, al, and, acclaimed, him, as, amir, al, mu, minin, commander, of, the, believers, when, muhammad, died, in, 632, ce, al, ibn, ab, lib, and, muhammad, s, closest, relatives, made, the, funeral, arrangements, while, they, were, preparing, his, body, ab, bakr, umar, ibn, al, kha, b, and, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, met, with, the, leaders, of, medina, and, elected, ab, bakr, as, the, first, r, shid, n, caliph, ab, bakr, served, from, 632, to, 634, and, was, followed, by, umar, 634, 644, and, uthm, n, 644, 656, with, the, murder, of, uthm, n, in, 657, ce, the, muslims, of, medina, invited, al, to, become, the, fourth, caliph, as, the, last, source, and, he, established, his, capital, in, kufa, al, s, rule, over, the, early, islamic, empire, between, 656, ce, to, 661, ce, was, often, contested, tensions, eventually, led, to, the, first, fitna, the, first, major, civil, war, between, muslims, within, the, empire, which, began, as, a, series, of, revolts, fought, against, al, while, the, rebels, had, previously, affirmed, the, legitimacy, of, al, s, khilaf, caliphate, they, later, turned, against, al, and, fought, him, tensions, escalated, into, the, battle, of, the, camel, in, 656, where, ali, s, forces, emerged, victorious, against, aisha, talhah, and, al, zubayr, however, the, battle, of, siffin, in, 657, turned, the, tide, against, al, who, lost, due, to, arbitration, issues, with, muawiyah, the, governor, of, damascus, al, withdrew, to, kufa, overcoming, the, kharijis, a, faction, that, had, transformed, from, supporters, to, bitter, rivals, at, nahrawan, in, 658, in, 661, al, was, assassinated, by, a, khariji, assassin, in, kufa, while, in, the, act, of, prostration, during, prayer, sujud, subsequently, muawiyah, asserted, his, claim, to, the, caliphate, upon, the, death, of, al, his, elder, son, asan, became, leader, of, the, muslims, of, kufa, after, a, series, of, skirmishes, between, the, kufa, muslims, and, the, army, of, muawiyah, asan, ibn, ali, agreed, to, cede, the, caliphate, to, muawiyah, and, maintain, peace, among, muslims, upon, certain, conditions, the, enforced, public, cursing, of, al, e, g, during, prayers, should, be, abandoned, muawiyah, should, not, use, tax, money, for, his, own, private, needs, there, should, be, peace, and, followers, of, asan, should, be, given, security, and, their, rights, muawiyah, will, never, adopt, the, title, of, amir, al, mu, minin, commander, of, the, believers, muawiyah, will, not, nominate, any, successor, asan, then, retired, to, medina, where, in, 670, ce, he, was, poisoned, by, his, wife, ja, da, bint, al, ash, ath, after, being, secretly, contacted, by, muawiyah, who, wished, to, pass, the, caliphate, to, his, own, son, yazid, and, saw, asan, as, an, obstacle, usayn, ibn, al, al, s, younger, son, and, brother, to, asan, initially, resisted, calls, to, lead, the, muslims, against, muawiyah, and, reclaim, the, caliphate, in, 680, ce, muawiyah, died, and, passed, the, caliphate, to, his, son, yazid, and, breaking, the, treaty, with, asan, ibn, al, yazid, asked, husayn, to, swear, allegiance, bay, ah, to, him, al, s, faction, having, expected, the, caliphate, to, return, to, al, s, line, upon, muawiyah, s, death, saw, this, as, a, betrayal, of, the, peace, treaty, and, so, usayn, rejected, this, request, for, allegiance, there, was, a, groundswell, of, support, in, kufa, for, usayn, to, return, there, and, take, his, position, as, caliph, and, imam, so, usayn, collected, his, family, and, followers, in, medina, and, set, off, for, kufa, en, route, to, kufa, husayn, was, blocked, by, an, army, of, yazid, s, men, which, included, people, from, kufa, near, karbala, rather, than, surrendering, husayn, and, his, followers, chose, to, fight, in, the, battle, of, karbala, usayn, and, approximately, 72, of, his, family, members, and, followers, were, killed, and, husayn, s, head, was, delivered, to, yazid, in, damascus, the, shi, a, community, regard, usayn, ibn, al, as, a, martyr, shahid, and, count, him, as, an, imam, from, the, ahl, al, bayt, the, battle, of, karbala, and, martyrdom, of, usayn, ibn, al, is, often, cited, as, the, definitive, separation, between, the, shia, and, sunn, sects, of, islam, usayn, is, the, last, imam, following, al, mutually, recognized, by, all, branches, of, shia, islam, the, martyrdom, of, husayn, and, his, followers, is, commemorated, on, the, day, of, ashura, occurring, on, the, tenth, day, of, muharram, the, first, month, of, the, islamic, calendar, later, most, denominations, of, shia, islam, including, twelvers, and, ism, l, s, became, imamis, imami, sh, tes, believe, that, imams, are, the, spiritual, and, political, successors, to, muhammad, imams, are, human, individuals, who, not, only, rule, over, the, muslim, community, with, justice, but, also, are, able, to, keep, and, interpret, the, divine, law, and, its, esoteric, meaning, the, words, and, deeds, of, muhammad, and, the, imams, are, a, guide, and, model, for, the, community, to, follow, as, a, result, they, must, be, free, from, error, and, sin, and, must, be, chosen, by, divine, decree, nass, through, muhammad, according, to, this, view, peculiar, to, shia, islam, there, is, always, an, imam, of, the, age, who, is, the, divinely, appointed, authority, on, all, matters, of, faith, and, law, in, the, muslim, community, al, was, the, first, imam, of, this, line, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, followed, by, male, descendants, of, muhammad, through, his, daughter, fatimah, this, difference, between, following, either, the, ahl, al, bayt, muhammad, s, family, and, descendants, or, pledging, allegiance, to, ab, bakr, has, shaped, the, shia, sunn, divide, on, the, interpretation, of, some, quranic, verses, hadith, literature, accounts, of, the, sayings, and, living, habits, attributed, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, during, his, lifetime, and, other, areas, of, islamic, belief, throughout, the, history, of, islam, for, instance, the, hadith, collections, venerated, by, shia, muslims, are,
