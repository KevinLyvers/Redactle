heaven, there, are, none, the, after, death, awakening, process, in, the, world, of, spirits, a, place, halfway, between, heaven, and, hell, and, where, people, first, wake, up, after, death, the, allowance, of, a, free, will, choice, between, heaven, or, hell, as, opposed, to, being, sent, to, either, one, by, god, the, eternity, of, hell, one, could, leave, but, would, never, want, to, and, that, all, angels, or, devils, were, once, people, on, earth, the, catholic, conception, of, the, afterlife, teaches, that, after, the, body, dies, the, soul, is, judged, the, righteous, and, free, of, sin, enter, heaven, however, those, who, die, in, unrepented, mortal, sin, go, to, hell, in, the, 1990s, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, defined, hell, not, as, punishment, imposed, on, the, sinner, but, rather, as, the, sinner, s, self, exclusion, from, god, unlike, other, christian, groups, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, those, who, die, in, a, state, of, grace, but, still, carry, venial, sin, go, to, a, place, called, purgatory, where, they, undergo, purification, to, enter, heaven, despite, popular, opinion, limbo, which, was, elaborated, upon, by, theologians, beginning, in, the, middle, ages, was, never, recognized, as, a, dogma, of, the, catholic, church, yet, at, times, it, has, been, a, very, popular, theological, theory, within, the, church, limbo, is, a, theory, that, unbaptized, but, innocent, souls, such, as, those, of, infants, or, virtuous, individuals, who, lived, before, jesus, christ, was, born, exist, in, neither, heaven, nor, hell, proper, therefore, these, souls, neither, merit, the, beatific, vision, nor, are, subjected, to, any, punishment, because, they, are, not, guilty, of, any, personal, sin, although, they, have, not, received, baptism, so, still, bear, original, sin, so, they, are, generally, seen, as, existing, in, a, state, of, natural, but, not, supernatural, happiness, until, the, end, of, time, in, other, christian, denominations, it, has, been, described, as, an, intermediate, place, or, state, of, confinement, in, oblivion, and, neglect, the, notion, of, purgatory, is, associated, particularly, with, the, catholic, church, in, the, catholic, church, all, those, who, die, in, god, s, grace, and, friendship, but, still, imperfectly, purified, are, indeed, assured, of, their, eternal, salvation, but, after, death, they, undergo, purification, so, as, to, achieve, the, holiness, necessary, to, enter, the, joy, of, heaven, or, the, final, purification, of, the, elect, which, is, entirely, different, from, the, punishment, of, the, damned, the, tradition, of, the, church, by, reference, to, certain, texts, of, scripture, speaks, of, a, cleansing, fire, although, it, is, not, always, called, purgatory, anglicans, of, the, anglo, catholic, tradition, generally, also, hold, to, the, belief, john, wesley, the, founder, of, methodism, believed, in, an, intermediate, state, between, death, and, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, in, the, possibility, of, continuing, to, grow, in, holiness, there, but, methodism, does, not, officially, affirm, this, belief, and, denies, the, possibility, of, helping, by, prayer, any, who, may, be, in, that, state, the, orthodox, church, is, intentionally, reticent, on, the, afterlife, as, it, acknowledges, the, mystery, especially, of, things, that, have, not, yet, occurred, beyond, the, second, coming, of, jesus, bodily, resurrection, and, final, judgment, all, of, which, is, affirmed, in, the, nicene, creed, 325, ad, orthodoxy, does, not, teach, much, else, in, any, definitive, manner, unlike, western, forms, of, christianity, however, orthodoxy, is, traditionally, non, dualist, and, does, not, teach, that, there, are, two, separate, literal, locations, of, heaven, and, hell, but, instead, acknowledges, that, the, location, of, one, s, final, destiny, heaven, or, hell, as, being, figurative, instead, orthodoxy, teaches, that, the, final, judgment, is, one, s, uniform, encounter, with, divine, love, and, mercy, but, this, encounter, is, experienced, multifariously, depending, on, the, extent, to, which, one, has, been, transformed, partaken, of, divinity, and, is, therefore, compatible, or, incompatible, with, god, the, monadic, immutable, and, ceaseless, object, of, eschatological, encounter, is, therefore, the, love, and, mercy, of, god, his, glory, which, infuses, the, heavenly, temple, and, it, is, the, subjective, human, reaction, which, engenders, multiplicity, or, any, division, of, experience, for, instance, st, isaac, the, syrian, observes, in, his, ascetical, homilies, that, those, who, are, punished, in, gehenna, are, scourged, by, the, scourge, of, love, the, power, of, love, works, in, two, ways, it, torments, sinners, bitter, regret, but, love, inebriates, the, souls, of, the, sons, of, heaven, by, its, delectability, in, this, sense, the, divine, action, is, always, immutably, and, uniformly, love, and, if, one, experiences, this, love, negatively, the, experience, is, then, one, of, self, condemnation, because, of, free, will, rather, than, condemnation, by, god, orthodoxy, therefore, uses, the, description, of, jesus, judgment, in, john, 3, 19, 21, as, their, model, 19, and, this, is, the, judgment, the, light, has, come, into, the, world, and, people, loved, the, darkness, rather, than, the, light, because, their, works, were, evil, 20, for, everyone, who, does, wicked, things, hates, the, light, and, does, not, come, to, the, light, lest, his, works, should, be, exposed, 21, but, whoever, does, what, is, true, comes, to, the, light, so, that, it, may, be, clearly, seen, that, his, works, have, been, carried, out, in, god, as, a, characteristically, orthodox, understanding, then, fr, thomas, hopko, writes, t, is, precisely, the, presence, of, god, s, mercy, and, love, which, cause, the, torment, of, the, wicked, god, does, not, punish, he, forgives, in, a, word, god, has, mercy, on, all, whether, all, like, it, or, not, if, we, like, it, it, is, paradise, if, we, do, not, it, is, hell, every, knee, will, bend, before, the, lord, everything, will, be, subject, to, him, god, in, christ, will, indeed, be, all, and, in, all, with, boundless, mercy, and, unconditional, pardon, but, not, all, will, rejoice, in, god, s, gift, of, forgiveness, and, that, choice, will, be, judgment, the, self, inflicted, source, of, their, sorrow, and, pain, moreover, orthodoxy, includes, a, prevalent, tradition, of, apokatastasis, or, the, restoration, of, all, things, in, the, end, this, has, been, taught, most, notably, by, origen, but, also, many, other, church, fathers, and, saints, including, gregory, of, nyssa, the, second, council, of, constantinople, 553, ad, affirmed, the, orthodoxy, of, gregory, of, nyssa, while, simultaneously, condemning, origen, s, brand, of, universalism, because, it, taught, the, restoration, back, to, our, pre, existent, state, which, orthodoxy, does, not, teach, it, is, also, a, teaching, of, such, eminent, orthodox, theologians, as, olivier, cl, ment, metropolitan, kallistos, ware, and, bishop, hilarion, alfeyev, although, apokatastasis, is, not, a, dogma, of, the, church, but, instead, a, theologoumenon, it, is, no, less, a, teaching, of, the, orthodox, church, than, its, rejection, as, met, kallistos, ware, explains, it, is, heretical, to, say, that, all, must, be, saved, for, this, is, to, deny, free, will, but, it, is, legitimate, to, hope, that, all, may, be, saved, as, insisting, on, torment, without, end, also, denies, free, will, joseph, f, smith, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, presents, an, elaborate, vision, of, the, afterlife, it, is, revealed, as, the, scene, of, an, extensive, missionary, effort, by, righteous, spirits, in, paradise, to, redeem, those, still, in, darkness, a, spirit, prison, or, hell, where, the, spirits, of, the, dead, remain, until, judgment, it, is, divided, into, two, parts, spirit, prison, and, paradise, together, these, are, also, known, as, the, spirit, world, also, abraham, s, bosom, see, luke, 16, 19, 25, they, believe, that, christ, visited, spirit, prison, 1, peter, 3, 18, 20, and, opened, the, gate, for, those, who, repent, to, cross, over, to, paradise, this, is, similar, to, the, harrowing, of, hell, doctrine, of, some, mainstream, christian, faiths, both, spirit, prison, and, paradise, are, temporary, according, to, latter, day, saint, beliefs, after, the, resurrection, spirits, are, assigned, permanently, to, three, degrees, of, heavenly, glory, determined, by, how, they, lived, celestial, terrestrial, and, telestial, 1, cor, 15, 44, 42, doctrine, and, covenants,

in, misery, and, agony, forever, however, according, to, the, beliefs, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, most, persons, lack, the, amount, of, knowledge, to, commit, the, eternal, sin, and, are, therefore, incapable, of, becoming, sons, of, perdition, the, celestial, kingdom, is, believed, to, be, a, place, where, the, righteous, can, live, eternally, with, their, families, progression, does, not, end, once, one, has, entered, the, celestial, kingdom, but, extends, eternally, according, to, true, to, the, faith, a, handbook, on, doctrines, in, the, lds, faith,

afterlife, however, they, believe, that, after, armageddon, there, will, be, a, bodily, resurrection, of, both, righteous, and, unrighteous, dead, but, not, the, wicked, survivors, of, armageddon, and, those, who, are, resurrected, are, then, to, gradually, restore, earth, to, a, paradise, after, armageddon, unrepentant, sinners, are, punished, with, eternal, death, non, existence, the,

undoing, of, what, was, created, this, is, described, in, ecclesiastes, 12, 7, when, a, person, dies, the, body, turns, to, dust, again, and, the, spirit, goes, back, to, god, who, gave, it, the, spirit, of, every, person, who, dies, whether, saved, or, unsaved, returns, to, god, at, death, the, spirit, that, returns, to, god, at, death, is, the, breath, of, life, the, quran, the, holy, book,

resemble, the, life, on, this, earth, in, the, sense, that, this, entity, will, bear, a, similar, relationship, to, the, soul, as, the, soul, bears, relationship, with, the, human, existence, on, earth, on, earth, if, a, person, leads, a, righteous, life, and, submits, to, the, will, of, god, his, or, her, tastes, become, attuned, to, enjoying, spiritual, pleasures, as, opposed, to, carnal,

sacrifice, of, one, s, own, rights, over, that, of, others, becomes, enjoyable, or, that, forgiveness, becomes, second, nature, in, such, a, state, a, person, finds, contentment, and, peace, at, heart, and, at, this, stage, according, to, ahmadiyya, beliefs, it, can, be, said, that, a, soul, within, the, soul, has, begun, to, take, shape, the, sufi, muslim, scholar, ibn, arabi, defined, barzakh, as, the, intermediate, realm, or, isthmus, it, is, between, the, world, of, corporeal, bodies, and, the, world, of, spirits, and, is, a, means, of, contact, between, the, two, worlds, without, it, there, would, be, no, contact, between, the, two, and, both, would, cease, to, exist, he, described, it, as, simple, and, luminous, like, the, world, of, spirits, but, also, able, to, take, on, many, different, forms, just, like, the, world, of, corporeal, bodies, can, in, broader, terms, barzakh, is, anything, that, separates, two, things, it, has, been, called, the, dream, world, in, which, the, dreamer, is, in, both, life, and, death, the, teachings, of, the, bah, faith, state, that, the, nature, of, the, afterlife, is, beyond, the, understanding, of, those, living, just, as, an, unborn, fetus, cannot, understand, the, nature, of, the, world, outside, of, the, womb, the, bah, writings, state, that, the, soul, is, immortal, and, after, death, it, will, continue, to, progress, until, it, finally, attains, god, s, presence, in, bah, belief, souls, in, the, afterlife, will, continue, to, retain, their, individuality, and, consciousness, and, will, be, able, to, recognize, and, communicate, spiritually, with, other, souls, whom, they, have, made, deep, profound, friendships, with, such, as, their, spouses, the, bah, scriptures, also, state, there, are, distinctions, between, souls, in, the, afterlife, and, that, souls, will, recognize, the, worth, of, their, own, deeds, and, understand, the, consequences, of, their, actions, it, is, explained, that, those, souls, that, have, turned, toward, god, will, experience, gladness, while, those, who, have, lived, in, error, will, become, aware, of, the, opportunities, they, have, lost, also, in, the, bah, view, souls, will, be, able, to, recognize, the, accomplishments, of, the, souls, that, have, reached, the, same, level, as, themselves, but, not, those, that, have, achieved, a, rank, higher, than, them, early, indian, religions, were, characterized, by, the, belief, in, an, afterlife, ancestor, worship, and, related, rites, these, concepts, started, to, significantly, change, after, the, period, of, the, upanishads, afterlife, in, buddhism, consists, of, intermediated, spirit, realm, that, s, beyond, spatial, means, which, includes, the, six, realms, of, existence, the, 31, planes, of, existence, naraka, tengoku, and, the, pure, land, after, achieving, enlightenment, ancestor, worship, and, links, to, one, s, ancestors, was, once, an, important, component, of, early, buddhism, but, became, less, relevant, already, before, the, formation, of, the, different, buddhist, streams, the, concepts, and, importance, of, afterlife, vary, among, modern, buddhist, teachings, buddhists, maintain, that, rebirth, takes, place, without, an, unchanging, self, or, soul, passing, from, one, form, to, another, the, type, of, rebirth, will, be, conditioned, by, the, moral, tone, of, the, person, s, actions, kamma, or, karma, for, example, if, a, person, has, committed, harmful, actions, by, body, speech, and, mind, based, on, greed, hate, and, delusion, would, have, his, her, rebirth, in, a, lower, realm, i, e, an, animal, a, hungry, ghost, or, a, hell, realm, is, to, be, expected, on, the, other, hand, where, a, person, has, performed, skillful, actions, based, on, generosity, loving, kindness, metta, compassion, and, wisdom, rebirth, in, a, happy, realm, i, e, human, or, one, of, the, many, heavenly, realms, can, be, expected, however, the, mechanism, of, rebirth, with, kamma, is, not, deterministic, it, depends, on, various, levels, of, kamma, the, most, important, moment, that, determines, where, a, person, is, reborn, into, is, the, last, thought, moment, at, that, moment, heavy, kamma, would, ripen, if, there, were, performed, if, not, near, death, kamma, would, ripen, and, if, not, death, kamma, then, habitual, kamma, would, ripen, finally, if, none, of, the, above, happened, then, residual, kamma, from, previous, actions, can, ripen, according, to, theravada, buddhism, there, are, 31, realms, of, existence, that, one, can, be, reborn, into, according, to, these, 31, existences, comprise, 20, existences, of, supreme, deities, brahmas, 6, existences, of, deities, devas, the, human, existence, manussa, and, lastly, 4, existences, of, deprivation, or, unhappiness, apaya, pure, land, buddhism, of, mahayana, believes, in, a, special, place, apart, from, the, 31, planes, of, existence, called, pure, land, it, is, believed, that, each, buddha, has, their, own, pure, land, created, out, of, their, merits, for, the, sake, of, sentient, beings, who, recall, them, mindfully, to, be, able, to, be, reborn, in, their, pure, land, and, train, to, become, a, buddha, there, thus, the, main, practice, of, pure, land, buddhism, is, to, chant, a, buddha, s, name, in, tibetan, buddhism, the, tibetan, book, of, the, dead, explains, the, intermediate, state, of, humans, between, death, and, reincarnation, the, deceased, will, find, the, bright, light, of, wisdom, which, shows, a, straightforward, path, to, move, upward, and, leave, the, cycle, of, reincarnation, there, are, various, reasons, why, the, deceased, do, not, follow, that, light, some, had, no, briefing, about, the, intermediate, state, in, the, former, life, others, only, used, to, follow, their, basic, instincts, like, animals, and, some, have, fear, which, results, from, foul, deeds, in, the, former, life, or, from, insistent, haughtiness, in, the, intermediate, state, the, awareness, is, very, flexible, so, it, is, important, to, be, virtuous, adopt, a, positive, attitude, and, avoid, negative, ideas, ideas, which, are, rising, from, subconsciousness, can, cause, extreme, tempers, and, cowing, visions, in, this, situation, they, have, to, understand, that, these, manifestations, are, just, reflections, of, the, inner, thoughts, no, one, can, really, hurt, them, because, they, have, no, more, material, body, the, deceased, get, help, from, different, buddhas, who, show, them, the, path, to, the, bright, light, the, ones, who, do, not, follow, the, path, after, all, will, get, hints, for, a, better, reincarnation, they, have, to, release, the, things, and, beings, on, which, or, whom, they, still, hang, from, the, life, before, it, is, recommended, to, choose, a, family, where, the, parents, trust, in, the, dharma, and, to, reincarnate, with, the, will, to, care, for, the, welfare, of, all, beings, there, are, two, major, views, of, an, afterlife, in, hinduism, mythical, and, philosophical, the, philosophies, of, hinduism, consider, each, individual, consists, of, three, bodies, physical, body, compose, of, water, and, bio, matter, sth, la, ar, ra, an, energetic, psychic, mental, subtle, body, s, k, ma, ar, ra, and, a, causal, body, k, ra, a, ar, ra, comprising, subliminal, stuff, i, e, mental, impressions, etc, the, individual, is, a, stream, of, consciousness, tman, which, flows, through, all, the, physical, changes, of, the, body, and, at, the, death, of, the, physical, body, flows, on, into, another, physical, body, the, two, components, that, transmigrate, are, the, subtle, body, and, the, causal, body, the, thought, that, occupies, the, mind, at, the, time, of, death, determines, the, quality, of, our, rebirth, antim, smara, a, hence, hinduism, advises, to, be, mindful, of, one, s, thoughts, and, cultivate, positive, wholesome, thoughts, mantra, chanting, japa, is, commonly, practiced, for, this, the, mythical, includes, the, philosophical, but, adds, heaven, and, hell, myths, when, one, leaves, the, physical, body, at, death, he, appears, in, the, court, of, yama, the, god, of, death, for, an, exit, interview, the, panel, consists, of, yama, and, chitragupta, the, cosmic, accountant, he, has, a, book, which, consists, the, history, of, the, dead, persons, according, to, his, her, mistakes, the, yama, decides, the, punishment, is, and, varuna, the, cosmic, intelligence, officer, he, is, counseled, about, his, life, achievements, and, failures, and, is, shown, a, mirror, in, which, his, entire, life, is, reflected, philosophically, these, three, men, are, projections, of, one, s, mind, yama, sends, him, to, a, heavenly, realm, svarga, if, he, has, been, exceptionally, benevolent, and, beneficent, for, a, period, of, rest, and, recreation, his, period, is, limited, in, time, by, the, weight, of, his, good, deeds, if, he, has, been, exceptionally, malevolent, and, caused, immense, suffering, to, other, beings, then, he, is, sent, to, a, hell, realm, naraka, for, his, sins, after, one, has, exhausted, his, karma, he, takes, birth, again, to, continue, his, spiritual, evolution, however, the, belief, in, rebirth, was, not, a, part, of, early, vedic, religions, and, texts, it, was, later, developed, by, rishi, s, sages, who, challenged, the, idea, of, one, s, life, as, being, simplistic, rebirth, can, take, place, as, a, god, deva, a, human, manu, ya, an, animal, tiryak, but, it, is, generally, taught, that, the, spiritual, evolution, takes, place, from, lower, to, higher, species, in, certain, cases, of, traumatic, death, a, person, can, take, the, form, of, a, preta, or, hungry, ghost, and, remains, in, an, earth, bound, state, interminably, until, certain, ceremonies, are, done, to, liberate, them, this, mythological, part, is, extensively, elaborated, in, the, puranas, especially, in, the, garuda, purana, the, upanishads, are, the, first, scriptures, in, hinduism, which, explicitly, mention, the, afterlife, the, bhagavad, gita, a, famous, hindu, scripture, says, that, just, as, a, man, discards, his, old, clothes, and, wears, new, ones, similarly, the, atman, discards, the, old, body, and, takes, on, a, new, one, in, hinduism, the, belief, is, that, the, body, is, nothing, but, a, shell, the, consciousness, inside, is, immutable, and, indestructible, and, takes, on, different, lives, in, a, cycle, of, birth, and, death, the, end, of, this, cycle, is, called, mukti, sanskrit, and, staying, finally, with, the, ultimate, reality, forever, is, moksha, sanskrit, or, liberation, the, diverse, views, of, modern, hinduism, in, part, differ, significantly, from, the, historical, vedic, religion, jainism, also, believes, in, the, afterlife, they, believe, that, the, soul, takes, on, a, body, form, based, on, previous, karmas, or, actions, performed, by, that, soul, through, eternity, jains, believe, the, soul, is, eternal, and, that, the, freedom, from, the, cycle, of, reincarnation, is, the, means, to, attain, eternal, bliss, the, essential, doctrine, of, sikhism, is, to, experience, the, divine, through, simple, living, meditation, and, contemplation, while, being, alive, sikhism, also, has, the, belief, of, being, in, union, with, god, while, living, accounts, of, afterlife, are, considered, to, be, aimed, at, the, popular, prevailing, views, of, the, time, so, as, to, provide, a, referential, framework, without, necessarily, establishing, a, belief, in, the, afterlife, thus, while, it, is, also, acknowledged, that, living, the, life, of, a, householder, is, above, the, metaphysical, truth, sikhism, can, be, considered, agnostic, to, the, question, of, an, afterlife, some, scholars, also, interpret, the, mention, of, reincarnation, to, be, naturalistic, akin, to, the, biogeochemical, cycles, but, if, one, analyses, the, sikh, scriptures, carefully, one, may, find, that, on, many, occasions, the, afterlife, and, the, existence, of, heaven, and, hell, are, mentioned, and, criticised, in, guru, granth, sahib, and, in, dasam, granth, as, non, true, man, made, ideas, so, from, that, it, can, be, concluded, that, sikhism, does, not, believe, in, the, existence, of, heaven, and, hell, however, heaven, and, hell, are, created, to, temporarily, reward, and, punish, and, one, will, then, take, birth, again, until, one, merges, in, god, according, to, the, sikh, scriptures, the, human, form, is, the, closet, form, to, god, if, the, guru, is, read, and, understood, and, the, best, opportunity, for, a, human, being, to, attain, salvation, and, merge, back, with, god, and, fully, understand, him, sikh, gurus, said, that, nothing, dies, nothing, is, born, everything, is, ever, present, and, it, just, changes, forms, like, standing, in, front, of, a, wardrobe, you, pick, up, a, dress, and, wear, it, and, then, you, discard, it, you, wear, another, one, thus, in, the, view, of, sikhism, your, soul, is, never, born, and, never, dies, your, soul, is, a, part, of, god, and, hence, lives, forever, confucius, did, not, directly, discuss, the, afterlife, nonetheless, chinese, folk, religion, has, had, a, strong, influence, on, confucianism, so, adherents, believe, that, their, ancestors, become, deified, spirits, after, death, ancestor, veneration, in, china, is, widespread, in, gnostic, teachings, humans, contain, a, divine, spark, within, them, said, to, have, been, trapped, in, their, bodies, by, the, creator, of, the, material, universe, known, as, the, demiurge, it, was, believed, that, this, spark, could, be, released, from, the, material, world, and, enter, into, the, heavenly, spiritual, world, beyond, it, if, special, knowledge, or, gnosis, was, attained, the, cathars, for, example, viewed, reincarnation, as, a, trap, made, by, satan, who, tricked, angels, from, the, heavenly, realm, into, entering, the, physical, bodies, of, humans, they, viewed, the, purpose, of, life, as, a, way, to, escape, the, constant, cycle, of, spiritual, incarnations, by, letting, go, of, worldly, attachments, it, is, common, for, families, to, participate, in, ceremonies, for, children, at, a, shrine, yet, have, a, buddhist, funeral, at, the, time, of, death, in, old, japanese, legends, it, is, often, claimed, that, the, dead, go, to, a, place, called, yomi, a, gloomy, underground, realm, with, a, river, separating, the, living, from, the, dead, mentioned, in, the, legend, of, izanami, and, izanagi, this, yomi, very, closely, resembles, the, greek, hades, however, later, myths, include, notions, of, resurrection, and, even, elysium, like, descriptions, such, as, in, the, legend, of, kuninushi, and, susanoo, shinto, tends, to, hold, negative, views, on, death, and, corpses, as, a, source, of, pollution, called, kegare, however, death, is, also, viewed, as, a, path, towards, apotheosis, in, shintoism, as, can, be, evidenced, by, how, legendary, individuals, become, enshrined, after, death, perhaps, the, most, famous, would, be, emperor, jin, who, was, enshrined, as, hachiman, the, god, of, war, after, his, death, the, spirit, world, according, to, spiritualism, is, the, world, or, realm, inhabited, by, spirits, both, good, or, evil, of, various, spiritual, manifestations, this, spirit, world, is, regarded, as, an, external, environment, for, spirits, the, spiritualism, religious, movement, in, the, nineteenth, century, espoused, a, belief, in, an, afterlife, where, individual, s, awareness, persists, beyond, death, taoism, views, life, as, an, illusion, and, death, as, a, transformation, into, immortality, taoists, believe, that, immortality, of, the, soul, can, be, achieved, by, living, a, virtuous, life, in, harmony, with, the, tao, they, are, taught, not, to, fear, death, as, it, is, simply, part, of, nature, traditional, african, religions, are, diverse, in, their, beliefs, in, an, afterlife, hunter, gatherer, societies, such, as, the, hadza, have, no, particular, belief, in, an, afterlife, and, the, death, of, an, individual, is, a, straightforward, end, to, their, existence, ancestor, cults, are, found, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, including, cultures, like, the, yombe, beng, yoruba, and, ewe, he, belief, that, the, dead, come, back, into, life, and, are, reborn, into, their, families, is, given, concrete, expression, in, the, personal, names, that, are, given, to, children, what, is, reincarnated, are, some, of, the, dominant, characteristics, of, the, ancestor, and, not, his, soul, for, each, soul, remains, distinct, and, each, birth, represents, a, new, soul, the, yoruba, dogon, and, lodagoa, have, eschatological, ideas, similar, to, abrahamic, religions, but, in, most, african, societies, there, is, a, marked, absence, of, such, clear, cut, notions, of, heaven, and, hell, although, there, are, notions, of, god, judging, the, soul, after, death, in, some, societies, like, the, mende, multiple, beliefs, coexist, the, mende, believe, that, people, die, twice, once, during, the, process, of, joining, the, secret, society, and, again, during, biological, death, after, which, they, become, ancestors, however, some, mende, also, believe, that, after, people, are, created, by, god, they, live, ten, consecutive, lives, each, in, progressively, descending, worlds, one, cross, cultural, theme, is, that, the, ancestors, are, part, of, the, world, of, the, living, interacting, with, it, regularly, some, unitarian, universalists, believe, in, universalism, that, all, souls, will, ultimately, be, saved, and, that, there, are, no, torments, of, hell, unitarian, universalists, differ, widely, in, their, theology, hence, there, is, no, exact, same, stance, on, the, issue, although, unitarians, historically, believed, in, a, literal, hell, and, universalists, historically, believed, that, everyone, goes, to, heaven, modern, unitarian, universalists, can, be, categorized, into, those, believing, in, a, heaven, reincarnation, and, oblivion, most, unitarian, universalists, believe, that, heaven, and, hell, are, symbolic, places, of, consciousness, and, the, faith, is, largely, focused, on, the, worldly, life, rather, than, any, possible, afterlife, the, wiccan, afterlife, is, most, commonly, described, as, the, summerland, here, souls, rest, recuperate, from, life, and, reflect, on, the, experiences, they, had, during, their, lives, after, a, period, of, rest, the, souls, are, reincarnated, and, the, memory, of, their, previous, lives, is, erased, many, wiccans, see, the, summerland, as, a, place, to, reflect, on, their, life, actions, it, is, not, a, place, of, reward, but, rather, the, end, of, a, life, journey, at, an, end, point, of, incarnations, zoroastrianism, states, that, the, urvan, the, disembodied, spirit, lingers, on, earth, for, three, days, before, departing, downward, to, the, kingdom, of, the, dead, that, is, ruled, by, yima, for, the, three, days, that, it, rests, on, earth, righteous, souls, sit, at, the, head, of, their, body, chanting, the, ustavaiti, gathas, with, joy, while, a, wicked, person, sits, at, the, feet, of, the, corpse, wails, and, recites, the, yasna, zoroastrianism, states, that, for, the, righteous, souls, a, beautiful, maiden, which, is, the, personification, of, the, soul, s, good, thoughts, words, and, deeds, appears, for, a, wicked, person, a, very, old, ugly, naked, hag, appears, after, three, nights, the, soul, of, the, wicked, is, taken, by, the, demon, vizaresa, v, zar, a, to, chinvat, bridge, and, is, made, to, go, to, darkness, hell, yima, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, king, on, earth, to, rule, as, well, as, the, first, man, to, die, inside, of, yima, s, realm, the, spirits, live, a, shadowy, existence, and, are, dependent, on, their, own, descendants, which, are, still, living, on, earth, their, descendants, are, to, satisfy, their, hunger, and, clothe, them, through, rituals, done, on, earth, rituals, which, are, done, on, the, first, three, days, are, vital, and, important, as, they, protect, the, soul, from, evil, powers, and, give, it, strength, to, reach, the, underworld, after, three, days, the, soul, crosses, chinvat, bridge, which, is, the, final,

research, was, founded, in, 1882, with, the, express, intention, of, investigating, phenomena, relating, to, spiritualism, and, the, afterlife, its, members, continue, to, conduct, scientific, research, on, the, paranormal, to, this, day, some, of, the, earliest, attempts, to, apply, scientific, methods, to, the, study, of, phenomena, relating, to, an, afterlife, were, conducted, by, this, organization, its, earliest, members, included, noted, scientists, like, william, crookes, and, philosophers, such, as, henry, sidgwick, and, william, james, parapsychological, investigation, of, the, afterlife, includes, the, study, of, haunting, apparitions, of, the, deceased, instrumental, trans, communication, electronic, voice, phenomena, and, mediumship, a, study, conducted, in, 1901, by, physician, duncan, macdougall, sought, to, measure, the, weight, lost, by, a, human, when, the, soul, departed, the, body, upon, death, macdougall, weighed, dying, patients, in, an, attempt, to, prove, that, the, soul, was, material, tangible, and, thus, measurable, although, macdougall, s, results, varied, considerably, from, 21, grams, for, some, people, this, figure, has, become, synonymous, with, the, measure, of, a, soul, s, mass, the, title, of, the, 2003, movie, 21, grams, is, a, reference, to, macdougall, s, findings, his, results, have, never, been, reproduced, and, are, generally, regarded, either, as, meaningless, or, considered, to, have, had, little, if, any, scientific, merit, frank, tipler, has, argued, that, physics, can, explain, immortality, although, such, arguments, are, not, falsifiable, and, in, karl, popper, s, views, they, do, not, qualify, as, science, after, 25, years, of, parapsychological, research, susan, blackmore, came, to, the, conclusion, that, according, to, her, experiences, there, is, not, enough, empirical, evidence, for, many, of, these, cases, mediums, purportedly, act, as, a, vessel, for, communications, from, spirits, in, other, realms, mediumship, is, not, specific, to, one, culture, or, religion, it, can, be, identified, in, several, belief, systems, most, notably, spiritualism, while, the, practice, gained, popularity, in, europe, and, north, america, in, the, 19th, century, evidence, of, mediumship, dates, back, thousands, of, years, in, asia, mediums, who, claim, to, have, contact, with, deceased, people, include, tyler, henry, and, pascal, voggenhuber, research, also, includes, the, study, of, the, near, death, experience, scientists, who, have, worked, in, this, area, include, elisabeth, k, bler, ross, raymond, moody, sam, parnia, michael, sabom, bruce, greyson, peter, fenwick, jeffrey, long, susan, blackmore, charles, tart, william, james, ian, stevenson, michael, persinger, pim, van, lommel, penny, sartori, walter, van, laack, among, others, past, life, regression, is, a, method, that, uses, hypnosis, to, recover, what, practitioners, believe, are, memories, of, past, lives, or, incarnations, the, technique, used, during, past, life, regression, involves, the, subject, answering, a, series, of, questions, while, hypnotized, to, reveal, identity, and, events, of, alleged, past, lives, a, method, similar, to, that, used, in, recovered, memory, therapy, and, one, that, similarly, often, misrepresents, memory, as, a, faithful, recording, of, previous, events, rather, than, a, constructed, set, of, recollections, however, medical, experts, and, practitioners, do, not, agree, that, the, past, life, memories, gained, from, past, life, regressions, are, truly, from, past, lives, experts, generally, regard, claims, of, recovered, memories, of, past, lives, as, fantasies, or, delusions, or, a, type, of, confabulation, because, the, use, of, hypnosis, and, suggestive, questions, can, tend, to, leave, the, subject, particularly, likely, to, hold, distorted, or, false, memories, there, is, a, view, based, on, the, philosophical, question, of, personal, identity, termed, open, individualism, by, daniel, kolak, that, concludes, that, individual, conscious, experience, is, illusory, and, because, consciousness, continues, after, death, in, all, conscious, beings, you, do, not, die, this, position, has, allegedly, been, supported, by, physicists, such, as, erwin, schr, dinger, and, freeman, dyson, certain, problems, arise, with, the, idea, of, a, particular, person, continuing, after, death, peter, van, inwagen, in, his, argument, regarding, resurrection, notes, that, the, materialist, must, have, some, sort, of, physical, continuity, john, hick, also, raises, questions, regarding, personal, identity, in, his, book, death, and, eternal, life, using, an, example, of, a, person, ceasing, to, exist, in, one, place, while, an, exact, replica, appears, in, another, if, the, replica, had, all, the, same, experiences, traits, and, physical, appearances, of, the, first, person, we, would, all, attribute, the, same, identity, to, the, second, according, to, hick, in, the, panentheistic, model, of, process, philosophy, and, theology, the, writers, alfred, north, whitehead, and, charles, hartshorne, rejected, the, idea, that, the, universe, was, made, of, substance, instead, saying, reality, is, composed, of, living, experiences, occasions, of, experience, according, to, hartshorne, people, do, not, experience, subjective, or, personal, immortality, in, the, afterlife, but, they, do, have, objective, immortality, because, their, experiences, live, on, forever, in, god, who, contains, all, that, was, however, other, process, philosophers, such, as, david, ray, griffin, have, written, that, people, may, have, subjective, experience, after, death, psychological, proposals, for, the, origin, of, a, belief, in, an, afterlife, include, cognitive, disposition, cultural, learning, and, as, an, intuitive, religious, idea, in, 2008, a, large, scale, study, conducted, by, the, university, of, southampton, involving, 2, 060, patients, from, 15, hospitals, in, the, united, kingdom, united, states, and, austria, was, launched, the, aware, awareness, during, resuscitation, study, examined, the, broad, range, of, mental, experiences, in, relation, to, death, in, a, large, study, researchers, also, tested, the, validity, of, conscious, experiences, for, the, first, time, using, objective, markers, to, determine, whether, claims, of, awareness, compatible, with, out, of, body, experiences, correspond, with, real, or, hallucinatory, events, the, results, revealed, that, 40, of, those, who, survived, a, cardiac, arrest, were, aware, during, the, time, that, they, were, clinically, dead, and, before, their, hearts, were, restarted, one, patient, also, had, a, verified, out, of, body, experience, over, 80, of, patients, did, not, survive, their, cardiac, arrest, or, were, too, sick, to, be, interviewed, but, his, cardiac, arrest, occurred, in, a, room, without, markers, dr, parnia, in, the, interview, stated, the, evidence, thus, far, suggests, that, in, the, first, few, minutes, after, death, consciousness, is, not, annihilated, the, aware, study, drew, the, following, primary, conclusions, studies, have, also, been, done, on, the, widely, reported, phenomenon, of, near, death, experiences, nde, experiencers, commonly, report, being, transported, to, a, different, realm, or, plane, of, existence, and, they, have, been, shown, to, display, a, lasting, positive, aftereffect, on, most, experiencers, under, the, theoretical, framework, of, extended, cognition, an, organism, s, cognitive, processes, may, exist, beyond, the, physical, body, and, persist, even, after, death
