stoicism, is, a, school, of, hellenistic, philosophy, that, flourished, in, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, the, stoics, believed, that, the, practice, of, virtue, is, enough, to, achieve, eudaimonia, a, well, lived, life, the, stoics, identified, the, path, to, achieving, it, with, a, life, spent, practicing, the, four, virtues, in, everyday, life, wisdom, courage, temperance, or, moderation, and, justice, as, well, as, living, in, accordance, with, nature, it, was, founded, in, the, ancient, agora, of, athens, by, zeno, of, citium, around, 300, bc, alongside, aristotle, s, ethics, the, stoic, tradition, forms, one, of, the, major, founding, approaches, to, virtue, ethics, the, stoics, are, especially, known, for, teaching, that, virtue, is, the, only, good, for, human, beings, and, that, external, things, such, as, health, wealth, and, pleasure, are, not, good, or, bad, in, themselves, adiaphora, but, have, value, as, material, for, virtue, to, act, upon, many, stoics, such, as, seneca, and, epictetus, emphasized, that, because, virtue, is, sufficient, for, happiness, a, sage, would, be, emotionally, resilient, to, misfortune, the, stoics, also, held, that, certain, destructive, emotions, resulted, from, errors, of, judgment, and, they, believed, people, should, aim, to, maintain, a, will, called, prohairesis, that, is, in, accordance, with, nature, because, of, this, the, stoics, thought, the, best, indication, of, an, individual, s, philosophy, was, not, what, a, person, said, but, how, a, person, behaved, to, live, a, good, life, one, had, to, understand, the, rules, of, the, natural, order, since, they, believed, everything, was, rooted, in, nature, stoicism, flourished, throughout, the, roman, and, greek, world, until, the, 3rd, century, ad, and, among, its, adherents, was, roman, emperor, marcus, aurelius, it, experienced, a, decline, after, christianity, became, the, state, religion, in, the, 4th, century, ad, since, then, it, has, seen, revivals, notably, in, the, renaissance, neostoicism, and, in, the, contemporary, era, modern, stoicism, the, name, stoicism, derives, from, the, stoa, poikile, ancient, greek, or, painted, porch, a, colonnade, decorated, with, mythic, and, historical, battle, scenes, on, the, north, side, of, the, agora, in, athens, where, zeno, of, citium, and, his, followers, gathered, to, discuss, their, ideas, near, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, unlike, the, epicureans, zeno, chose, to, teach, his, philosophy, in, a, public, space, stoicism, was, originally, known, as, zenonism, however, this, name, was, soon, dropped, likely, because, the, stoics, did, not, consider, their, founders, to, be, perfectly, wise, and, to, avoid, the, risk, of, the, philosophy, becoming, a, cult, of, personality, zeno, s, ideas, developed, from, those, of, the, cynics, brought, to, him, by, crates, of, thebes, whose, founding, father, antisthenes, had, been, a, disciple, of, socrates, zeno, s, most, influential, successor, was, chrysippus, who, followed, cleanthes, as, leader, of, the, school, and, was, responsible, for, molding, what, is, now, called, stoicism, stoicism, became, the, foremost, popular, philosophy, among, the, educated, elite, in, the, hellenistic, world, and, the, roman, empire, to, the, point, where, in, the, words, of, gilbert, murray, nearly, all, the, successors, of, alexander, professed, themselves, stoics, later, roman, stoics, focused, on, promoting, a, life, in, harmony, within, the, universe, within, which, we, are, active, participants, scholars, usually, divide, the, history, of, stoicism, into, three, phases, the, early, stoa, from, zeno, s, founding, to, antipater, the, middle, stoa, including, panaetius, and, posidonius, and, the, late, stoa, including, musonius, rufus, seneca, epictetus, and, marcus, aurelius, no, complete, works, survived, from, the, first, two, phases, of, stoicism, only, roman, texts, from, the, late, stoa, survived, philosophy, does, not, promise, to, secure, anything, external, for, man, otherwise, it, would, be, admitting, something, that, lies, beyond, its, proper, subject, matter, for, as, the, material, of, the, carpenter, is, wood, and, that, of, statuary, bronze, so, the, subject, matter, of, the, art, of, living, is, each, person, s, own, life, of, all, the, schools, of, ancient, philosophy, stoicism, made, the, greatest, claim, to, being, utterly, systematic, in, the, view, of, the, stoics, philosophy, is, the, practice, of, virtue, and, virtue, the, highest, form, of, which, is, utility, is, generally, speaking, constructed, from, ideals, of, logic, monistic, physics, and, naturalistic, ethics, these, three, ideals, constitute, virtue, which, is, necessary, for, living, a, well, reasoned, life, seeing, as, they, are, all, parts, of, a, logos, or, philosophical, discourse, which, includes, the, mind, s, rational, dialogue, with, itself, of, them, the, stoics, emphasized, ethics, as, the, main, focus, of, human, knowledge, though, their, logical, theories, were, of, more, interest, for, later, philosophers, stoicism, teaches, the, development, of, self, control, as, a, means, of, overcoming, destructive, emotions, the, philosophy, holds, that, becoming, a, clear, and, unbiased, thinker, allows, one, to, understand, the, universal, reason, logos, stoicism, s, primary, aspect, involves, improving, the, individual, s, ethical, and, moral, well, being, virtue, consists, in, a, will, that, is, in, agreement, with, nature, this, principle, also, applies, to, the, realm, of, interpersonal, relationships, to, be, free, from, anger, envy, and, jealousy, and, to, accept, even, slaves, as, equals, of, other, men, because, all, men, alike, are, products, of, nature, the, stoic, ethic, espouses, a, deterministic, perspective, in, regard, to, those, who, lack, stoic, virtue, cleanthes, once, opined, that, the, wicked, man, is, like, a, dog, tied, to, a, cart, and, compelled, to, go, wherever, it, goes, a, stoic, of, virtue, by, contrast, would, amend, his, will, to, suit, the, world, and, remain, in, the, words, of, epictetus, sick, and, yet, happy, in, peril, and, yet, happy, dying, and, yet, happy, in, exile, and, happy, in, disgrace, and, happy, thus, positing, a, completely, autonomous, individual, will, and, at, the, same, time, a, universe, that, is, a, rigidly, deterministic, single, whole, this, viewpoint, was, later, described, as, classical, pantheism, and, was, adopted, by, dutch, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, diodorus, cronus, who, was, one, of, zeno, s, teachers, is, considered, the, philosopher, who, first, introduced, and, developed, an, approach, to, logic, now, known, as, propositional, logic, which, is, based, on, statements, or, propositions, rather, than, terms, differing, greatly, from, aristotle, s, term, logic, later, chrysippus, developed, a, system, that, became, known, as, stoic, logic, and, included, a, deductive, system, stoic, syllogistic, which, was, considered, a, rival, to, aristotle, s, syllogistic, see, syllogism, new, interest, in, stoic, logic, came, in, the, 20th, century, when, important, developments, in, logic, were, based, on, propositional, logic, susanne, bobzien, wrote, the, many, close, similarities, between, chrysippus, s, philosophical, logic, and, that, of, gottlob, frege, are, especially, striking, bobzien, also, notes, that, chrysippus, wrote, over, 300, books, on, logic, on, virtually, any, topic, logic, today, concerns, itself, with, including, speech, act, theory, sentence, analysis, singular, and, plural, expressions, types, of, predicates, indexicals, existential, propositions, sentential, connectives, negations, disjunctions, conditionals, logical, consequence, valid, argument, forms, theory, of, deduction, propositional, logic, modal, logic, tense, logic, epistemic, logic, logic, of, suppositions, logic, of, imperatives, ambiguity, and, logical, paradoxes, the, stoics, held, that, all, beings, though, not, all, things, are, material, besides, the, existing, beings, they, admitted, four, incorporeals, asomata, time, place, void, and, sayable, they, were, held, to, be, just, subsisting, while, such, a, status, was, denied, to, universals, thus, they, accepted, anaxagoras, s, idea, as, did, aristotle, that, if, an, object, is, hot, it, is, because, some, part, of, a, universal, heat, body, had, entered, the, object, but, unlike, aristotle, they, extended, the, idea, to, cover, all, accidents, thus, if, an, object, is, red, it, would, be, because, some, part, of, a, universal, red, body, had, entered, the, object, they, held, that, there, were, four, categories, the, stoics, outlined, that, our, own, actions, thoughts, and, reactions, are, within, our, control, the, opening, paragraph, of, the, enchiridion, states, the, categories, as, some, things, in, the, world, are, up, to, us, while, others, are, not, up, to, us, are, our, faculties, of, judgment, motivation, desire, and, aversion, in, short, whatever, is, our, own, doing, these, suggest, a, space, that, is, up, to, us, or, within, our, power, a, simple, example, of, the, stoic, categories, in, use, is, provided, by, jacques, brunschwig, i, am, a, certain, lump, of, matter, and, thereby, a, substance, an, existent, something, and, thus, far, that, is, all, i, am, a, man, and, this, individual, man, that, i, am, and, thereby, qualified, by, a, common, quality, and, a, peculiar, one, i, am, sitting, or, standing, disposed, in, a, certain, way, i, am, the, father, of, my, children, the, fellow, citizen, of, my, fellow, citizens, disposed, in, a, certain, way, in, relation, to, something, else, the, stoics, propounded, that, knowledge, can, be, attained, through, the, use, of, reason, truth, can, be, distinguished, from, fallacy, even, if, in, practice, only, an, approximation, can, be, made, according, to, the, stoics, the, senses, constantly, receive, sensations, pulsations, that, pass, from, objects, through, the, senses, to, the, mind, where, they, leave, an, impression, in, the, imagination, phantasiai, an, impression, arising, from, the, mind, was, called, a, phantasma, the, mind, has, the, ability, to, judge, synkatathesis, approve, or, reject, an, impression, enabling, it, to, distinguish, a, true, representation, of, reality, from, one, that, is, false, some, impressions, can, be, assented, to, immediately, but, others, can, achieve, only, varying, degrees, of, hesitant, approval, which, can, be, labeled, belief, or, opinion, doxa, it, is, only, through, reason, that, we, gain, clear, comprehension, and, conviction, katalepsis, certain, and, true, knowledge, episteme, achievable, by, the, stoic, sage, can, be, attained, only, by, verifying, the, conviction, with, the, expertise, of, one, s, peers, and, the, collective, judgment, of, humankind, according, to, the, stoics, the, universe, is, a, material, reasoning, substance, logos, which, was, divided, into, two, classes, the, active, and, the, passive, the, passive, substance, is, matter, which, lies, sluggish, a, substance, ready, for, any, use, but, sure, to, remain, unemployed, if, no, one, sets, it, in, motion, the, active, substance, is, an, intelligent, aether, or, primordial, fire, which, acts, on, the, passive, matter, the, universe, itself, is, god, and, the, universal, outpouring, of, its, soul, it, is, this, same, world, s, guiding, principle, operating, in, mind, and, reason, together, with, the, common, nature, of, things, and, the, totality, that, embraces, all, existence, then, the, foreordained, might, and, necessity, of, the, future, then, fire, and, the, principle, of, aether, then, those, elements, whose, natural, state, is, one, of, flux, and, transition, such, as, water, earth, and, air, then, the, sun, the, moon, the, stars, and, the, universal, existence, in, which, all, things, are, contained, everything, is, subject, to, the, laws, of, fate, for, the, universe, acts, according, to, its, own, nature, and, the, nature, of, the, passive, matter, it, governs, the, souls, of, humans, and, animals, are, emanations, from, this, primordial, fire, and, are, likewise, subject, to, fate, constantly, regard, the, universe, as, one, living, being, having, one, substance, and, one, soul, and, observe, how, all, things, have, reference, to, one, perception, the, perception, of, this, one, living, being, and, how, all, things, act, with, one, movement, and, how, all, things, are, the, cooperating, causes, of, all, things, that, exist, observe, too, the, continuous, spinning, of, the, thread, and, the, structure, of, the, web, individual, souls, are, perishable, by, nature, and, can, be, transmuted, and, diffused, assuming, a, fiery, nature, by, being, received, into, the, seminal, reason, logos, spermatikos, of, the, universe, since, right, reason, is, the, foundation, of, both, humanity, and, the, universe, stoic, theology, is, a, fatalistic, and, naturalistic, pantheism, god, is, never, fully, transcendent, but, always, immanent, and, identified, with, nature, abrahamic, religions, personalize, god, as, a, world, creating, entity, but, stoicism, equates, god, with, the, totality, of, the, universe, according, to, stoic, cosmology, which, is, very, similar, to, the, hindu, conception, of, existence, there, is, no, absolute, start, to, time, as, it, is, considered, infinite, and, cyclic, similarly, space, and, the, universe, have, neither, start, nor, end, rather, they, are, cyclical, the, current, universe, is, a, phase, in, the, present, cycle, preceded, by, an, infinite, number, of, universes, doomed, to, be, destroyed, ekpyr, sis, conflagration, and, re, created, again, and, to, be, followed, by, another, infinite, number, of, universes, stoicism, considers, all, existence, as, cyclical, the, cosmos, as, eternally, self, creating, and, self, destroying, see, also, eternal, return, stoicism, does, not, posit, a, beginning, or, end, to, the, universe, according, to, the, stoics, the, logos, was, the, active, reason, or, anima, mundi, pervading, and, animating, the, entire, universe, it, was, conceived, as, material, and, is, usually, identified, with, god, or, nature, the, stoics, also, referred, to, the, seminal, reason, logos, spermatikos, or, the, law, of, generation, in, the, universe, which, was, the, principle, of, the, active, reason, working, in, inanimate, matter, humans, too, each, possess, a, portion, of, the, divine, logos, which, is, the, primordial, fire, and, reason, that, controls, and, sustains, the, universe, the, foundation, of, stoic, ethics, is, that, good, lies, in, the, state, of, the, soul, itself, in, wisdom, and, self, control, one, must, therefore, strive, to, be, free, of, the, passions, for, the, stoics, reason, meant, using, logic, and, understanding, the, processes, of, nature, the, logos, or, universal, reason, inherent, in, all, things, the, greek, word, pathos, was, a, wide, ranging, term, indicating, an, infliction, one, suffers, the, stoics, used, the, word, to, discuss, many, common, emotions, such, as, anger, fear, and, excessive, joy, a, passion, is, a, disturbing, and, misleading, force, in, the, mind, which, occurs, because, of, a, failure, to, reason, correctly, for, the, stoic, chrysippus, the, passions, are, evaluative, judgements, a, person, experiencing, such, an, emotion, has, incorrectly, valued, an, indifferent, thing, a, fault, of, judgement, some, false, notion, of, good, or, evil, lies, at, the, root, of, each, passion, incorrect, judgement, as, to, a, present, good, gives, rise, to, delight, while, lust, is, a, wrong, estimate, about, the, future, unreal, imaginings, of, evil, cause, distress, about, the, present, or, fear, for, the, future, the, ideal, stoic, would, instead, measure, things, at, their, real, value, and, see, that, the, passions, are, not, natural, to, be, free, of, the, passions, is, to, have, a, happiness, which, is, self, contained, there, would, be, nothing, to, fear, for, unreason, is, the, only, evil, no, cause, for, anger, for, others, cannot, harm, you, the, stoics, arranged, the, passions, under, four, headings, distress, pleasure, fear, and, lust, one, report, of, the, stoic, definitions, of, these, passions, appears, in, the, treatise, on, passions, by, chrysippus, trans, long, sedley, pg, 411, modified, two, of, these, passions, distress, and, delight, refer, to, emotions, currently, present, and, two, of, these, fear, and, lust, refer, to, emotions, directed, at, the, future, thus, there, are, just, two, states, directed, at, the, prospect, of, good, and, evil, but, subdivided, as, to, whether, they, are, present, or, future, numerous, subdivisions, of, the, same, class, were, brought, under, the, head, of, the, separate, passions, the, wise, person, sophos, is, someone, who, is, free, from, the, passions, apatheia, instead, the, sage, experiences, good, feelings, eupatheia, which, are, clear, headed, these, emotional, impulses, are, not, excessive, but, nor, are, they, diminished, emotions, instead, they, are, the, correct, rational, emotions, the, stoics, listed, the, good, feelings, under, the, headings, of, joy, chara, wish, boulesis, and, caution, eulabeia, thus, if, something, is, present, which, is, a, genuine, good, then, the, wise, person, experiences, an, uplift, in, the, soul, joy, chara, the, stoics, also, subdivided, the, good, feelings, the, stoics, accepted, that, suicide, was, permissible, for, the, wise, person, in, circumstances, that, might, prevent, them, from, living, a, virtuous, life, such, as, if, they, fell, victim, to, severe, pain, or, disease, but, otherwise, suicide, would, usually, be, seen, as, a, rejection, of, one, s, social, duty, for, example, plutarch, reports, that, accepting, life, under, tyranny, would, have, compromised, cato, s, self, consistency, constantia, as, a, stoic, and, impaired, his, freedom, to, make, the, honorable, moral, choices, early, stoics, differed, significantly, from, late, stoics, in, their, views, of, sexuality, romantic, love, and, sexual, relationships, zeno, first, advocated, for, a, republic, ruled, by, love, and, not, by, law, where, marriage, would, be, abolished, wives, would, be, held, in, common, and, eroticism, would, be, practiced, with, both, boys, and, girls, with, educative, purposes, to, develop, virtue, in, the, loved, ones, however, he, did, not, condemn, marriage, per, se, considering, it, equally, a, natural, occurrence, he, regarded, same, sex, relationships, positively, and, maintained, that, wise, men, should, have, carnal, knowledge, no, less, and, no, more, of, a, favorite, than, of, a, non, favorite, nor, of, a, female, than, of, a, male, zeno, favored, love, over, desire, clarifying, that, the, ultimate, goal, of, sexuality, should, be, virtue, and, friendship, among, later, stoics, epictetus, maintained, homosexual, and, heterosexual, attraction, as, equivalent, in, this, regard, and, condemned, only, the, kind, of, desire, that, led, one, to, act, against, judgement, however, contemporaneous, positions, generally, advanced, towards, equating, sexuality, with, passion, and, although, they, were, still, not, hostile, to, sexual, relationships, by, themselves, they, nonetheless, believed, those, should, be, limited, in, order, to, retain, self, control, musonius, espoused, the, only, natural, kind, of, sex, was, that, meant, for, procreation, defending, a, companionate, form, of, marriage, between, man, and, woman, and, considered, relationships, solely, undergone, for, pleasure, or, affection, as, unnatural, plotinus, criticized, both, aristotle, s, categories, and, those, of, the, stoics, his, student, porphyry, however, defended, aristotle, s, scheme, he, justified, this, by, arguing, that, they, be, interpreted, strictly, as, expressions, rather, than, as, metaphysical, realities, the, approach, can, be, justified, at, least, in, part, by, aristotle, s, own, words, in, the, categories, boethius, acceptance, of, porphyry, s, interpretation, led, to, their, being, accepted, by, scholastic, philosophy, the, fathers, of, the, church, regarded, stoicism, as, a, pagan, philosophy, nonetheless, early, christian, writers, employed, some, of, the, central, philosophical, concepts, of, stoicism, examples, include, the, terms, logos, virtue, spirit, and, conscience, but, the, parallels, go, well, beyond, the, sharing, and, borrowing, of, terminology, both, stoicism, and, christianity, assert, an, inner, freedom, in, the, face, of, the, external, world, a, belief, in, human, kinship, with, nature, or, god, a, sense, of, the, innate, depravity, or, persistent, evil, of, humankind, and, the, futility, and, temporary, nature, of, worldly, possessions, and, attachments, both, encourage, ascesis, with, respect, to, the, passions, and, inferior, emotions, such, as, lust, and, envy, so, that, the, higher, possibilities, of, one, s, humanity, can, be, awakened, and, developed, stoic, influence, can, also, be, seen, in, the, works, of, ambrose, of, milan, marcus, minucius, felix, and, tertullian, the, modern, usage, is, a, person, who, represses, feelings, or, endures, patiently, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, s, entry, on, stoicism, notes, the, sense, of, the, english, adjective, stoical, is, not, utterly, misleading, with, regard, to, its, philosophical, origins, the, revival, of, stoicism, in, the, 20th, century, can, be, traced, to, the, publication, of, problems, in, stoicism, by, a, a, long, in, 1971, and, also, as, part, of, the, late, 20th, century, surge, of, interest, in, virtue, ethics, contemporary, stoicism, draws, from, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, spike, in, publications, of, scholarly, works, on, ancient, stoicism, beyond, that, the, current, stoicist, movement, traces, its, roots, to, the, work, of, albert, ellis, who, developed, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, as, well, as, aaron, t, beck, who, is, regarded, by, many, as, the, father, of, early, versions, of, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, stoic, philosophy, was, the, original, philosophical, inspiration, for, modern, cognitive, psychotherapy, particularly, as, mediated, by, albert, ellis, rational, emotive, behaviour, therapy, rebt, the, major, precursor, of, cbt, the, original, cognitive, therapy, treatment, manual, for, depression, by, aaron, t, beck, et, al, states, the, philosophical, origins, of, cognitive, therapy, can, be, traced, back, to, the, stoic, philosophers, a, well, known, quotation, from, enchiridion, of, epictetus, was, taught, to, most, clients, during, the, initial, session, of, traditional, rebt, by, ellis, and, his, followers, it, s, not, the, events, that, upset, us, but, our, judgments, about, the, events, this, subsequently, became, a, common, element, in, the, socialization, phase, of, many, other, approaches, to, cbt, the, question, of, stoicism, s, influence, on, modern, psychotherapy, particularly, rebt, and, cbt, was, described, in, detail, in, the, philosophy, of, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, by, donald, robertson, several, early, 20th, century, psychotherapists, were, influenced, by, stoicism, most, notably, the, rational, persuasion, school, founded, by, the, swiss, neurologist, and, psychotherapist, paul, dubois, who, drew, heavily, on, stoicism, in, his, clinical, work, and, encouraged, his, clients, to, study, passages, from, seneca, the, younger, as, homework, assignments, similarities, of, modern, stoicism, and, third, wave, cbt, have, been, suggested, as, well, and, individual, reports, of, its, potency, in, treating, depression, have, been, published, there, has, also, been, interest, in, applying, the, tenets, of, ancient, stoicism, to, the, human, origin, story, environmental, education, vegetarianism, and, the, modern, challenges, of, sustainable, development, material, consumption, and, consumerism, seamus, mac, suibhne, has, described, the, practices, of, spiritual, exercises, as, influencing, those, of, reflective, practice, many, parallels, between, stoic, spiritual, exercises, and, modern, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, have, been, identified, according, to, philosopher, pierre, hadot, philosophy, for, a, stoic, is, not, just, a, set, of, beliefs, or, ethical, claims, it, is, a, way, of, life, involving, constant, practice, and, training, or, ask, sis, an, active, process, of, constant, practice, and, self, reminder, epictetus, in, his, discourses, distinguished, between, three, types, of, act, judgment, desire, and, inclination, which, hadot, identifies, these, three, acts, with, logic, physics, and, ethics, respectively, hadot, writes, that, in, the, meditations, each, maxim, develops, either, one, of, these, very, characteristic, topoi, or, two, of, them, or, three, of, them, stoicorum, veterum, fragmenta, is, a, collection, by, hans, von, arnim, of, fragments, and, testimonia, of, the, earlier, stoics, published, in, 1903, 1905, as, part, of, the, bibliotheca, teubneriana, it, includes, the, fragments, and, testimonia, of, zeno, of, citium, chrysippus, and, their, immediate, followers, at, first, the, work, consisted, of, three, volumes, to, which, maximilian, adler, in, 1924, added, a, fourth, containing, general, indices, teubner, reprinted, the, whole, work, in, 1964
