the, quran, also, romanized, qur, an, or, koran, is, the, central, religious, text, of, islam, believed, by, muslims, to, be, a, revelation, directly, from, god, all, h, it, is, organized, in, 114, chapters, surah, pl, suwer, which, consist, of, individual, verses, yah, besides, its, religious, significance, it, is, widely, regarded, as, the, finest, work, in, arabic, literature, and, has, significantly, influenced, the, arabic, language, it, is, the, object, of, a, modern, field, of, academic, research, known, as, quranic, studies, muslims, believe, the, quran, was, orally, revealed, by, god, to, the, final, islamic, prophet, muhammad, through, the, angel, gabriel, incrementally, over, a, period, of, some, 23, years, beginning, on, the, night, of, power, when, muhammad, was, 40, and, concluding, in, 632, the, year, of, his, death, muslims, regard, the, quran, as, muhammad, s, most, important, miracle, a, proof, of, his, prophethood, and, the, culmination, of, a, series, of, divine, messages, starting, with, those, revealed, to, the, first, islamic, prophet, adam, including, the, islamic, holy, books, of, the, torah, psalms, and, gospel, the, quran, is, believed, by, muslims, to, be, god, s, own, divine, speech, providing, a, complete, code, of, conduct, across, all, facets, of, life, this, has, led, muslim, theologians, to, fiercely, debate, whether, the, quran, was, created, or, uncreated, according, to, tradition, several, of, muhammad, s, companions, served, as, scribes, recording, the, revelations, shortly, after, muhammad, s, death, the, quran, was, compiled, on, the, order, of, the, first, caliph, abu, bakr, r, 632, 634, by, the, companions, who, had, written, down, or, memorized, parts, of, it, caliph, uthman, r, 644, 656, established, a, standard, version, now, known, as, the, uthmanic, codex, which, is, generally, considered, the, archetype, of, the, quran, known, today, there, are, however, variant, readings, with, some, differences, in, meaning, the, quran, assumes, the, reader, s, familiarity, with, major, narratives, recounted, in, the, biblical, and, apocryphal, texts, it, summarizes, some, dwells, at, length, on, others, and, in, some, cases, presents, alternative, accounts, and, interpretations, of, events, the, quran, describes, itself, as, a, book, of, guidance, for, humankind, 2, 185, it, sometimes, offers, detailed, accounts, of, specific, historical, events, and, it, often, emphasizes, the, moral, significance, of, an, event, over, its, narrative, sequence, supplementing, the, quran, with, explanations, for, some, cryptic, quranic, narratives, and, rulings, that, also, provide, the, basis, for, islamic, law, in, most, denominations, of, islam, are, hadiths, oral, and, written, traditions, believed, to, describe, words, and, actions, of, muhammad, during, prayers, the, quran, is, recited, only, in, arabic, someone, who, has, memorized, the, entire, quran, is, called, a, hafiz, ideally, verses, are, recited, with, a, special, kind, of, prosody, reserved, for, this, purpose, called, tajwid, during, the, month, of, ramadan, muslims, typically, complete, the, recitation, of, the, whole, quran, during, tarawih, prayers, in, order, to, extrapolate, the, meaning, of, a, particular, quranic, verse, muslims, rely, on, exegesis, or, commentary, rather, than, a, direct, translation, of, the, text, the, word, qur, n, appears, about, 70, times, in, the, quran, itself, assuming, various, meanings, it, is, a, verbal, noun, ma, dar, of, the, arabic, verb, qara, a, meaning, he, read, or, he, recited, the, syriac, equivalent, is, qery, n, which, refers, to, scripture, reading, or, lesson, while, some, western, scholars, consider, the, word, to, be, derived, from, the, syriac, the, majority, of, muslim, authorities, hold, the, origin, of, the, word, is, qara, a, itself, regardless, it, had, become, an, arabic, term, by, muhammad, s, lifetime, an, important, meaning, of, the, word, is, the, act, of, reciting, as, reflected, in, an, early, quranic, passage, it, is, for, us, to, collect, it, and, to, recite, it, qur, nahu, in, other, verses, the, word, refers, to, an, individual, passage, recited, its, liturgical, context, is, seen, in, a, number, of, passages, for, example, so, when, al, qur, n, is, recited, listen, to, it, and, keep, silent, the, word, may, also, assume, the, meaning, of, a, codified, scripture, when, mentioned, with, other, scriptures, such, as, the, torah, and, gospel, the, term, also, has, closely, related, synonyms, that, are, employed, throughout, the, quran, each, synonym, possesses, its, own, distinct, meaning, but, its, use, may, converge, with, that, of, qur, n, in, certain, contexts, such, terms, include, kit, b, book, yah, sign, and, s, rah, scripture, the, latter, two, terms, also, denote, units, of, revelation, in, the, large, majority, of, contexts, usually, with, a, definite, article, al, the, word, is, referred, to, as, the, wa, y, revelation, that, which, has, been, sent, down, tanz, l, at, intervals, other, related, words, include, dhikr, remembrance, used, to, refer, to, the, quran, in, the, sense, of, a, reminder, and, warning, and, ikmah, wisdom, sometimes, referring, to, the, revelation, or, part, of, it, the, quran, describes, itself, as, the, discernment, al, furq, n, the, mother, book, umm, al, kit, b, the, guide, huda, the, wisdom, hikmah, the, remembrance, dhikr, and, the, revelation, tanz, l, something, sent, down, signifying, the, descent, of, an, object, from, a, higher, place, to, lower, place, another, term, is, al, kit, b, the, book, though, it, is, also, used, in, the, arabic, language, for, other, scriptures, such, as, the, torah, and, the, gospels, the, term, mus, haf, written, work, is, often, used, to, refer, to, particular, quranic, manuscripts, but, is, also, used, in, the, quran, to, identify, earlier, revealed, books, islamic, tradition, relates, that, muhammad, received, his, first, revelation, in, 610, ce, in, the, cave, of, hira, on, the, night, of, power, during, one, of, his, isolated, retreats, to, the, mountains, thereafter, he, received, revelations, over, a, period, of, 23, years, according, to, hadith, traditions, ascribed, to, muhammad, and, muslim, history, after, muhammad, and, his, followers, immigrated, to, medina, and, formed, an, independent, muslim, community, he, ordered, many, of, his, companions, to, recite, the, quran, and, to, learn, and, teach, the, laws, which, were, revealed, daily, it, is, related, that, some, of, the, quraysh, who, were, taken, prisoners, at, the, battle, of, badr, regained, their, freedom, after, they, had, taught, some, of, the, muslims, the, simple, writing, of, the, time, thus, a, group, of, muslims, gradually, became, literate, as, it, was, initially, spoken, the, quran, was, recorded, on, tablets, bones, and, the, wide, flat, ends, of, date, palm, fronds, most, suras, also, usually, transliterated, as, surah, were, in, use, amongst, early, muslims, since, they, are, mentioned, in, numerous, sayings, by, both, sunni, and, shia, sources, relating, muhammad, s, use, of, the, quran, as, a, call, to, islam, the, making, of, prayer, and, the, manner, of, recitation, however, the, quran, did, not, exist, in, book, form, at, the, time, of, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, at, age, 61, 62, there, is, agreement, among, scholars, that, muhammad, himself, did, not, write, down, the, revelation, sahih, al, bukhari, narrates, muhammad, describing, the, revelations, as, sometimes, it, is, revealed, like, the, ringing, of, a, bell, and, a, isha, reported, i, saw, the, prophet, being, inspired, divinely, on, a, very, cold, day, and, noticed, the, sweat, dropping, from, his, forehead, as, the, inspiration, was, over, muhammad, s, first, revelation, according, to, the, quran, was, accompanied, with, a, vision, the, agent, of, revelation, is, mentioned, as, the, one, mighty, in, power, the, one, who, grew, clear, to, view, when, he, was, on, the, uppermost, horizon, then, he, drew, nigh, and, came, down, till, he, was, distant, two, bows, length, or, even, nearer, the, islamic, studies, scholar, welch, states, in, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, that, he, believes, the, graphic, descriptions, of, muhammad, s, condition, at, these, moments, may, be, regarded, as, genuine, because, he, was, severely, disturbed, after, these, revelations, according, to, welch, these, seizures, would, have, been, seen, by, those, around, him, as, convincing, evidence, for, the, superhuman, origin, of, muhammad, s, inspirations, however, muhammad, s, critics, accused, him, of, being, a, possessed, man, a, soothsayer, or, a, magician, since, his, experiences, were, similar, to, those, claimed, by, such, figures, well, known, in, ancient, arabia, welch, additionally, states, that, it, remains, uncertain, whether, these, experiences, occurred, before, or, after, muhammad, s, initial, claim, of, prophethood, the, quran, describes, muhammad, as, ummi, which, is, traditionally, interpreted, as, illiterate, but, the, meaning, is, rather, more, complex, medieval, commentators, such, as, al, tabari, d, 923, maintained, that, the, term, induced, two, meanings, first, the, inability, to, read, or, write, in, general, second, the, inexperience, or, ignorance, of, the, previous, books, or, scriptures, but, they, gave, priority, to, the, first, meaning, muhammad, s, illiteracy, was, taken, as, a, sign, of, the, genuineness, of, his, prophethood, for, example, according, to, fakhr, al, din, al, razi, if, muhammad, had, mastered, writing, and, reading, he, possibly, would, have, been, suspected, of, having, studied, the, books, of, the, ancestors, some, scholars, such, as, w, montgomery, watt, prefer, the, second, meaning, of, ummi, they, take, it, to, indicate, unfamiliarity, with, earlier, sacred, texts, the, final, verse, of, the, quran, was, revealed, on, the, 18th, of, the, islamic, month, of, dhu, al, hijjah, in, the, year, 10, a, h, a, date, that, roughly, corresponds, to, february, or, march, 632, the, verse, was, revealed, after, the, prophet, finished, delivering, his, sermon, at, ghadir, khumm, according, to, islamic, tradition, the, qur, an, was, revealed, to, muhammad, in, seven, different, ahruf, meaning, letters, however, it, could, mean, dialects, forms, styles, or, modes, most, islamic, scholars, agree, that, these, different, ahruf, are, the, same, qur, an, revealed, in, seven, different, arabic, dialects, and, that, they, do, not, change, the, meaning, of, the, qur, an, the, purpose, of, which, was, to, make, the, qur, an, easy, for, recitation, and, memorization, among, the, different, arab, tribes, only, one, harf, out, of, the, seven, survived, and, is, still, in, use, which, is, believed, to, be, the, quraysh, dialect, while, sunni, muslims, believe, in, the, seven, ahruf, some, shia, reject, the, idea, of, seven, qur, anic, variants, a, common, misconception, is, that, the, seven, ahruf, and, the, qira, at, are, the, same, following, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, a, number, of, his, companions, who, memorized, the, quran, were, killed, in, the, battle, of, al, yamama, by, musaylima, the, first, caliph, abu, bakr, r, 632, 634, subsequently, decided, to, collect, the, book, in, one, volume, so, that, it, could, be, preserved, zayd, ibn, thabit, d, 655, was, the, person, to, collect, the, quran, since, he, used, to, write, the, divine, inspiration, for, allah, s, apostle, thus, a, group, of, scribes, most, importantly, zayd, collected, the, verses, and, produced, a, hand, written, manuscript, of, the, complete, book, the, manuscript, according, to, zayd, remained, with, abu, bakr, until, he, died, zayd, s, reaction, to, the, task, and, the, difficulties, in, collecting, the, quranic, material, from, parchments, palm, leaf, stalks, thin, stones, collectively, known, as, suhuf, any, written, work, containing, divine, teachings, and, from, men, who, knew, it, by, heart, is, recorded, in, earlier, narratives, in, 644, muhammad, s, widow, hafsa, bint, umar, was, entrusted, with, the, manuscript, until, the, third, caliph, uthman, r, 644, 656, requested, the, standard, copy, from, her, according, to, historian, michael, cook, early, muslim, narratives, about, the, collection, and, compilation, of, the, quran, sometimes, contradict, themselves, most, make, uthman, little, more, than, an, editor, but, there, are, some, in, which, he, appears, very, much, a, collector, appealing, to, people, to, bring, him, any, bit, of, the, quran, they, happen, to, possess, some, accounts, also, suggest, that, in, fact, the, material, abu, bakr, worked, with, had, already, been, assembled, which, since, he, was, the, first, caliph, would, mean, they, were, collected, when, muhammad, was, still, alive, around, the, 650s, the, islamic, expansion, beyond, the, arabian, peninsula, and, into, perisa, the, levant, and, north, africa, as, well, as, the, use, of, the, seven, ahruf, had, caused, some, confusion, and, differences, in, the, pronunciation, of, the, qur, an, and, conflict, was, arising, between, different, arab, tribes, due, to, some, claiming, to, be, more, superior, to, other, arab, tribes, and, non, arabs, based, on, dialect, which, uthman, noticed, in, order, to, preserve, the, sanctity, of, the, text, he, ordered, a, committee, headed, by, zayd, to, use, abu, bakr, s, copy, and, prepare, a, standard, text, of, the, quran, thus, within, 20, years, of, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, the, complete, quran, was, committed, to, written, form, as, the, uthmanic, codex, that, text, became, the, model, from, which, copies, were, made, and, promulgated, throughout, the, urban, centers, of, the, muslim, world, and, other, versions, are, believed, to, have, been, destroyed, and, the, six, other, ahruf, of, the, qur, an, fell, out, of, use, the, present, form, of, the, quran, text, is, accepted, by, muslim, scholars, to, be, the, original, version, compiled, by, abu, bakr, qira, at, which, is, a, way, and, method, of, reciting, the, qur, an, was, developed, sometime, afterwards, there, are, ten, canonical, recitations, and, they, are, not, to, be, confused, with, ahruf, shias, recite, the, quran, according, to, the, qira, at, of, hafs, on, authority, of, asim, which, is, the, prevalent, qira, at, in, the, islamic, world, and, believe, that, the, quran, was, gathered, and, compiled, by, muhammad, during, his, lifetime, it, is, claimed, that, the, shia, had, more, than, 1, 000, hadiths, ascribed, to, the, shia, imams, which, indicate, the, distortion, of, the, quran, and, according, to, etan, kohlberg, this, belief, about, quran, was, common, among, shiites, in, the, early, centuries, of, islam, in, his, view, ibn, babawayh, was, the, first, major, twelver, author, to, adopt, a, position, identical, to, that, of, the, sunnis, and, the, change, was, a, result, of, the, rise, to, power, of, the, sunni, abbasid, caliphate, whence, belief, in, the, corruption, of, the, quran, became, untenable, vis, a, vis, the, position, of, sunni, orthodoxy, alleged, distortions, have, been, carried, out, to, remove, any, references, to, the, rights, of, ali, the, imams, and, their, supporters, and, the, disapproval, of, enemies, such, as, umayyads, and, abbasids, other, personal, copies, of, the, quran, might, have, existed, including, ibn, mas, ud, s, and, ubay, ibn, ka, b, s, codex, none, of, which, exist, today, since, muslims, could, regard, criticism, of, the, qur, an, as, a, crime, of, apostasy, punishable, by, death, under, sharia, it, seemed, impossible, to, conduct, studies, on, the, qur, an, that, went, beyond, textual, criticism, until, the, early, 1970s, non, muslim, scholars, of, islam, while, not, accepting, traditional, explanations, for, divine, intervention, accepted, the, above, mentioned, traditional, origin, story, in, most, details, university, of, chicago, professor, fred, donner, states, that, here, was, a, very, early, attempt, to, establish, a, uniform, consonantal, text, of, the, qur, n, from, what, was, probably, a, wider, and, more, varied, group, of, related, texts, in, early, transmission, after, the, creation, of, this, standardized, canonical, text, earlier, authoritative, texts, were, suppressed, and, all, extant, manuscripts, despite, their, numerous, variants, seem, to, date, to, a, time, after, this, standard, consonantal, text, was, established, although, most, variant, readings, of, the, text, of, the, quran, have, ceased, to, be, transmitted, some, still, are, there, has, been, no, critical, text, produced, on, which, a, scholarly, reconstruction, of, the, quranic, text, could, be, based, in, 1972, in, a, mosque, in, the, city, of, sana, a, yemen, manuscripts, consisting, of, 12, 000, pieces, were, discovered, that, were, later, proven, to, be, the, oldest, quranic, text, known, to, exist, at, the, time, the, sana, a, manuscripts, contain, palimpsests, manuscript, pages, from, which, the, text, has, been, washed, off, to, make, the, parchment, reusable, again, a, practice, which, was, common, in, ancient, times, due, to, the, scarcity, of, writing, material, however, the, faint, washed, off, underlying, text, scriptio, inferior, is, still, barely, visible, studies, using, radiocarbon, dating, indicate, that, the, parchments, are, dated, to, the, period, before, 671, ce, with, a, 99, percent, probability, the, german, scholar, gerd, r, puin, has, been, investigating, these, quran, fragments, for, years, his, research, team, made, 35, 000, microfilm, photographs, of, the, manuscripts, which, he, dated, to, the, early, part, of, the, 8th, century, puin, has, noted, unconventional, verse, orderings, minor, textual, variations, and, rare, styles, of, orthography, and, suggested, that, some, of, the, parchments, were, palimpsests, which, had, been, reused, puin, believed, that, this, implied, an, evolving, text, as, opposed, to, a, fixed, one, in, 2015, a, single, folio, of, a, very, early, quran, dating, back, to, 1370, years, earlier, was, discovered, in, the, library, of, the, university, of, birmingham, england, according, to, the, tests, carried, out, by, the, oxford, university, radiocarbon, accelerator, unit, with, a, probability, of, more, than, 95, the, parchment, was, from, between, 568, and, 645, the, manuscript, is, written, in, hijazi, script, an, early, form, of, written, arabic, this, possibly, was, one, of, the, earliest, extant, exemplars, of, the, quran, but, as, the, tests, allow, a, range, of, possible, dates, it, cannot, be, said, with, certainty, which, of, the, existing, versions, is, the, oldest, saudi, scholar, saud, al, sarhan, has, expressed, doubt, over, the, age, of, the, fragments, as, they, contain, dots, and, chapter, separators, that, are, believed, to, have, originated, later, the, birmingham, manuscript, caused, excitement, amongst, believers, because, of, its, potential, overlapping, with, the, dominant, tradition, over, the, lifetime, of, muhammad, c, 570, to, 632, ce, and, used, as, evidence, to, support, conventional, wisdom, and, to, refute, the, revisionists, views, that, expresses, findings, and, views, different, from, the, traditional, approach, to, the, early, history, of, the, quran, and, islam, the, quranic, content, is, concerned, with, basic, islamic, beliefs, including, the, existence, of, god, and, the, resurrection, narratives, of, the, early, prophets, ethical, and, legal, subjects, historical, events, of, muhammad, s, time, charity, and, prayer, also, appear, in, the, quran, the, quranic, verses, contain, general, exhortations, regarding, right, and, wrong, and, historical, events, are, related, to, outline, general, moral, lessons, the, style, of, the, quran, has, been, called, allusive, with, commentaries, needed, to, explain, what, is, being, referred, to, events, are, referred, to, but, not, narrated, disagreements, are, debated, without, being, explained, people, and, places, are, mentioned, but, rarely, named, while, tafsir, in, islamic, sciences, expresses, the, effort, to, understand, the, implied, and, implicit, expressions, of, the, quran, fiqh, refers, to, the, efforts, to, expand, the, meaning, of, expressions, especially, in, the, verses, related, to, the, provisions, as, well, as, understanding, it, quranic, studies, state, that, in, the, historical, context, the, content, of, the, quran, is, related, to, rabbinic, jewish, christian, syriac, christian, and, hellenic, literature, as, well, as, pre, islamic, arabia, many, places, subjects, and, mythological, figures, in, the, culture, of, arabs, and, many, nations, in, their, historical, neighbourhoods, especially, judeo, christian, stories, are, included, in, the, quran, with, small, allusions, references, or, sometimes, small, narratives, such, as, jann, t, adn, jahannam, seven, sleepers, queen, of, sheba, etc, however, some, philosophers, and, scholars, such, as, mohammed, arkoun, who, emphasize, the, mythological, content, of, the, quran, are, met, with, rejectionist, attitudes, in, islamic, circles, the, stories, of, yusuf, and, zulaikha, moses, family, of, amram, parents, of, mary, according, to, the, quran, and, mysterious, hero, dhul, qarnayn, the, man, with, two, horns, who, built, a, barrier, against, gog, and, magog, that, will, remain, until, the, end, of, time, are, more, detailed, and, longer, stories, apart, from, semi, historical, events, and, characters, such, as, king, solomon, and, david, about, jewish, history, as, well, as, the, exodus, of, the, israelites, from, egypt, tales, of, the, hebrew, prophets, accepted, in, islam, such, as, creation, the, flood, struggle, of, abraham, with, nimrod, sacrifice, of, his, son, occupy, a, wide, place, in, the, quran, the, quran, uses, cosmological, and, contingency, arguments, in, various, verses, without, referring, to, the, terms, to, prove, the, existence, of, god, therefore, the, universe, is, originated, and, needs, an, originator, and, whatever, exists, must, have, a, sufficient, cause, for, its, existence, besides, the, design, of, the, universe, is, frequently, referred, to, as, a, point, of, contemplation, it, is, he, who, has, created, seven, heavens, in, harmony, you, cannot, see, any, fault, in, god, s, creation, then, look, again, can, you, see, any,

human, beings, are, equal, in, their, utter, dependence, upon, god, and, their, well, being, depends, upon, their, acknowledging, that, fact, and, living, accordingly, even, though, muslims, do, not, doubt, about, the, existence, and, unity, of, god, they, may, have, adopted, different, attitudes, that, have, changed, and, developed, throughout, history, regarding, his, nature, attributes, names, and, relationship, with, creation, in, islam, god, speaks, to, people, called, prophets, through, a, kind, of, revelation, called, wahy, or, through, angels, 42, 51, although, poetry, shu, ara, 224, and, prophecy, claiming, to, know, the, unseen, or, the, future, are, seen, as, despicable, behavior, in, islam, 7, 188, 27, 65, nubuwwah, arabic, prophethood, is, seen, as, a, duty, imposed, by, god,

you, that, your, lord, has, at, his, command, forgiveness, as, well, as, a, most, grievous, penalty, islam, regards, abraham, as, a, link, in, the, chain, of, prophets, that, begins, with, adam, and, culminates, in, muhammad, via, ishmael, and, mentioned, in, 35, chapters, of, the, quran, more, often, than, any, other, biblical, personage, apart, from, moses, muslims, regard, him, as, an, idol,

such, as, the, word, and, spirit, of, god, and, two, suras, dedicated, to, his, mother, maryam, in, the, quran, the, fact, that, maryam, is, connected, to, the, imran, family, in, the, al, imran, creates, a, separate, focal, point, in, islam, christian, polemics, apart, from, theology, according, to, as, saff, 6, while, he, is, a, harbinger, of, muhammad, sunni, understanding, posits, that,

then, kill, the, dajjal, and, that, islam, will, rule, the, earth, again, while, belief, in, god, and, obedience, to, the, prophets, are, the, main, emphasis, in, the, prophetic, stories, there, are, also, non, prophetic, stories, in, the, quran, that, emphasize, the, importance, of, humility, and, having, profound, inner, knowledge, hikmah, besides, trusting, in, god, this, is, the, main, theme, in, the, stories, of, khidr, luqman, and, dhulqarnayn, according, to, the, later, ascriptions, to, these, stories, it, is, possible, for, those, with, this, knowledge, and, divine, support, to, teach,

an, important, part, of, islamist, jihadist, indoctrination, today, as, well, as, shiite, teachings, hence, ma, ruf, and, munkar, should, be, the, key, words, in, understanding, the, quran, in, moral, terms, as, a, duty, that, the, quran, imposes, on, believers, although, a, common, translation, of, the, phrase, is, enjoining, good, and, forbidding, evil, the, words, used, by, islamic, philosophy, determining, good, and, evil, in, discourses, are, husn, and, qubh, the, word, ma, ruf, literally, means, known, or, what, is, approved, because, of, its, familiarity, for, a, certain, society, and, its, antithesis, munkar, means, what, is, disapproved, because, it, is, unknown, and, extraneous, it, also, affirms, family, life, by, legislating, on, matters, of, marriage, divorce, and, inheritance, a, number, of, practices, such, as, usury, and, gambling, are, prohibited, the, quran, is, one, of, the, fundamental, sources, of, islamic, law, sharia, some, formal, religious, practices, receive, significant, attention, in, the, quran, including, the, salat, and, fasting, in, the, month, of, ramadan, as, for, the, manner, in, which, the, prayer, is, to, be, conducted, the, quran, refers, to, prostration, the, term, chosen, for, charity, zakat, literally, means, purification, implies, that, it, is, a, self, purification, in, fiqh, the, term, fard, is, used, for, clear, imperative, provisions, based, on, the, quran, however, it, is, not, possible, to, say, that, the, relevant, verses, are, understood, in, the, same, way, by, all, segments, of, islamic, commentators, for, example, hanafis, accept, 5, daily, prayers, as, fard, however, some, religious, groups, such, as, quranists, and, shiites, who, do, not, doubt, that, the, quran, existing, today, is, a, religious, source, infer, from, the, same, verses, that, it, is, clearly, ordered, to, pray, 2, or, 3, times, not, 5, times, about, six, verses, adress, to, the, way, a, woman, should, dress, when, walk, in, public, muslim, scholars, have, differed, as, how, to, understand, these, verses, with, some, stating, that, a, hijab, is, a, command, fard, to, be, fulfilled, and, others, say, simply, not, research, shows, that, the, rituals, in, the, quran, along, with, laws, such, as, qisas, and, tax, zakat, developed, as, an, evolution, of, pre, islamic, arabian, rituals, arabic, words, meaning, pilgrimage, hajj, prayer, sal, t, and, charity, zak, t, can, be, seen, in, pre, islamic, safaitic, arabic, inscriptions, and, this, continuity, can, be, observed, in, many, details, especially, in, hajj, and, umrah, whether, temporary, marriage, which, was, a, pre, islamic, arabic, tradition, and, was, widely, practiced, among, muslims, during, the, lifetime, of, muhammad, was, abolished, in, islam, is, also, an, area, where, sunni, and, shiite, understandings, conflict, as, well, as, the, translation, interpretation, of, the, related, verse, quran, 4, 24, and, ethical, religious, problems, regarding, it, although, it, is, believed, in, islam, that, the, pre, islamic, prophets, provided, general, guidance, and, that, some, books, were, sent, down, to, them, their, stories, such, as, lot, and, story, with, his, daughters, in, the, bible, conveyed, from, any, source, are, called, isra, iliyyat, and, are, met, with, suspicion, the, provisions, that, might, arise, from, them, such, as, the, consumption, of, wine, could, only, be, abrogated, provisions, naskh, the, guidance, of, the, quran, and, muhammad, is, considered, absolute, universal, and, will, continue, until, the, end, of, time, however, today, this, understanding, is, questioned, in, certain, circles, it, is, claimed, that, the, provisions, and, contents, in, sources, such, as, the, quran, and, hadith, apart, from, general, purposes, are, contents, that, reflect, the, general, understanding, and, practices, of, that, period, and, it, is, brought, up, to, replace, the, sharia, practices, that, pose, problems, in, terms, of, today, s, ethic, values, with, new, interpretations, the, doctrine, of, the, last, day, and, eschatology, the, final, fate, of, the, universe, may, be, considered, the, second, great, doctrine, of, the, quran, it, is, estimated, that, approximately, one, third, of, the, quran, is, eschatological, dealing, with, the, afterlife, in, the, next, world, and, with, the, day, of, judgment, at, the, end, of, time, the, quran, does, not, assert, a, natural, immortality, of, the, human, soul, since, man, s, existence, is, dependent, on, the, will, of, god, when, he, wills, he, causes, man, to, die, and, when, he, wills, he, raises, him, to, life, again, in, a, bodily, resurrection, in, the, quran, belief, in, the, afterlife, is, often, referred, in, conjunction, with, belief, in, god, believe, in, god, and, the, last, day, emphasizing, what, is, considered, impossible, is, easy, in, the, sight, of, god, a, number, of, suras, such, as, 44, 56, 75, 78, 81, and, 101, are, directly, related, to, the, afterlife, and, warn, people, to, be, prepared, for, the, imminent, day, referred, to, in, various, ways, it, is, the, day, of, judgment, the, last, day, the, day, of, resurrection, or, simply, the, hour, less, frequently, it, is, the, day, of, distinction, the, day, of, the, gathering, or, the, day, of, the, meeting, signs, of, the, hour, in, the, quran,

jesus, is, a, sign, of, the, hour, despite, the, uncertainty, of, the, time, is, emphasized, with, the, statement, that, it, is, only, in, the, presence, of, god, 43, 61, there, is, a, rich, eschatological, literature, in, the, islamic, world, and, doomsday, prophecies, in, the, islamic, world, are, heavily, associated, with, round, numbers, said, nursi, interpreted, the, expressions, in, the, quran, and, hadiths, as, metaphorical, or, allegorical, symbolizations, and, benefited, from, numerological, methods, applied, to, some, ayah, hadith, fragments, in, his, own, prophecies, in, the, apocalyptic, scenes, clues, are, included, regarding, the, nature, structure, and, dimensions, of, the, celestial, bodies, as, perceived, in, the, quran, while, the, stars, are, lamps,

jahannam, maalik, have, come, from, foreign, cultures, through, historical, evolution, according, to, m, shamsher, ali, there, are, around, 750, verses, in, the, quran, dealing, with, natural, phenomena, and, many, verses, of, the, quran, ask, mankind, to, study, nature, and, this, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, an, encouragement, for, scientific, inquiry, and, of, the, truth, some, include, travel, throughout, the, earth, and, see, how, he, brings, life, into, being, q29, 20, behold, in, the, creation, of, the, heavens, and, the, earth, and, the, alternation, of, night, and,

evidence, and, follow, not, that, of, which, you, have, not, the, knowledge, of, 17, 36, and, in, several, different, verses, asks, muslims, to, require, proofs, say, bring, your, proof, if, you, are, truthful, 2, 111, he, associates, some, scientific, contradictions, that, can, be, seen, in, the, quran, with, a, superficial, reading, of, the, quran, ismail, al, faruqi, and, taha, jabir, alalwani, are, of, the, view, that, any, reawakening, of, the, muslim, civilization, must, start, with, the, quran, however, the, biggest, obstacle, on, this, route, is, the, centuries, old, heritage, of, tafseer, and, other, disciplines, which, inhibit, a, universal, conception, of, the, quran, s, message, author, rodney, stark, argues, that, islam, s, lag, behind, the, west, in, scientific, advancement, after, roughly, 1500, ad, was, due, to, opposition, by, traditional, ulema, to, efforts, to, formulate, systematic, explanation, of, natural, phenomenon, with, natural, laws, he, claims, that, they, believed, such, laws, were, blasphemous, because, they, limit, god, s, freedom, to, act, as, he, wishes, taner, edis, wrote, many, muslims, appreciate, technology, and, respect, the, role, that, science, plays, in, its, creation, as, a, result, he, says, there, is, a, great, deal, of, islamic, pseudoscience, attempting, to, reconcile, this, respect, with, religious, beliefs, this, is, because, according, to, edis, true, criticism, of, the, quran, is, almost, non, existent, in, the, muslim, world, while, christianity, is, less, prone, to, see, its, holy, book, as, the, direct, word, of, god, fewer, muslims, will, compromise, on, this, idea, causing, them, to, believe, that, scientific, truths, must, appear, in, the, quran, starting, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, the, idea, of, presence, of, scientific, evidence, in, the, quran, became, popularized, as, ijaz, miracle, literature, also, called, bucailleism, and, began, to, be, distributed, through, muslim, bookstores, and, websites, the, movement, contends, that, the, quran, abounds, with, scientific, facts, that, appeared, centuries, before, their, discovery, and, promotes, islamic, creationism, according, to, author, ziauddin, sardar, the, ijaz, movement, has, created, a, global, craze, in, muslim, societies, and, has, developed, into, an, industry, that, is, widespread, and, well, funded, individuals, connected, with, the, movement, include, abdul, majeed, al, zindani, who, established, the, commission, on, scientific, signs, in, the, quran, and, sunnah, zakir, naik, the, indian, televangelist, and, adnan, oktar, the, turkish, creationist, enthusiasts, of, the, movement, argue, that, among, the, miracles, found, in, the, quran, are, everything, from, relativity, quantum, mechanics, big, bang, theory, black, holes, and, pulsars, genetics, embryology, modern, geology, thermodynamics, even, the, laser, and, hydrogen, fuel, cells, zafar, ishaq, ansari, terms, the, modern, trend, of, claiming, the, identification, of, scientific, truths, in, the, quran, as, the, scientific, exegesis, of, the, holy, book, in, 1983, keith, l, moore, had, a, special, edition, published, of, his, widely, used, textbook, on, embryology, the, developing, human, clinically, oriented, embryology, co, authored, by, abdul, majeed, al, zindani, with, islamic, additions, interspersed, pages, of, embryology, related, quranic, verse, and, hadith, by, al, zindani, into, moore, s, original, work, ali, a, rizvi, studying, the, textbook, of, moore, and, al, zindani, found, himself, confused, by, why, moore, was, so, astonished, by, the, quranic, references, which, rizvi, found, vague, and, insofar, as, they, were, specific, preceded, by, the, observations, of, aristotle, and, the, ayr, veda, or, easily, explained, by, common, sense, critics, argue, verses, that, proponents, say, explain, modern, scientific, facts, about, subjects, such, as, biology, the, origin, and, history, of, the, earth, and, the, evolution, of, human, life, contain, fallacies, and, are, unscientific, as, of, 2008, both, muslims, and, non, muslims, have, disputed, whether, there, actually, are, scientific, miracles, in,

an, arabic, phrase, meaning, in, the, name, of, god, there, are, however, still, 114, occurrences, of, the, bismillah, in, the, quran, due, to, its, presence, in, quran, 27, 30, as, the, opening, of,

been, described, as, rhymed, prose, as, it, partakes, of, both, poetry, and, prose, however, this, description, runs, the, risk, of, failing, to, convey, the, rhythmic, quality, of, quranic, language, which, is, more, poetic, in, some, parts, and, more, prose, like, in, others, rhyme, while, found, throughout, the, quran, is, conspicuous, in, many, of, the, earlier, meccan, suras, in, which, relatively, short, verses, throw, the, rhyming, words, into, prominence, the, effectiveness, of, such, a, form, is, evident, for, instance, in, sura, 81, and, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, these, passages, impressed, the, conscience, of, the, hearers, frequently, a, change, of, rhyme, from, one, set, of, verses, to, another, signals, a, change, in, the, subject, of, discussion, later,

composition, in, sells, s, phrase, is, in, fact, a, literary, device, capable, of, delivering, profound, effects, as, if, the, intensity, of, the, prophetic, message, were, shattering, the, vehicle,

self, referential, when, it, speaks, about, itself, and, makes, reference, to, itself, according, to, stefan, wild, the, quran, demonstrates, this, metatextuality, by, explaining, classifying, interpreting, and, justifying, the, words, to, be, transmitted, self, referentiality, is, evident, in, those, passages, where, the, quran, refers, to, itself, as, revelation, tanzil, remembrance, dhikr, news, naba, criterion, furqan, in, a, self, designating, manner, explicitly, asserting, its, divinity, and, this, is, a, blessed, remembrance, that, we, have, sent, down, so, are, you, now,

prophetic, status, the, literary, quality, of, the, qur, an, has, been, praised, by, muslim, scholars, and, by, many, non, muslim, scholars, the, doctrine, of, the, miraculousness, of, the, quran, is,

composition, or, a, certain, special, way, of, joining, words, angelika, neuwirth, lists, the, factors, that, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, doctrine, of, i, j, z, the, necessity, of, explaining, some, challenging, verses, in, the, quran, in, the, context, of, the, emergence, of, the, theory, of, proofs, of, prophecy, d, il, an, nubuwwa, in, islamic, theology, proving, that, the, quran, is, a, work, worthy, of, the, emphasized, superior, place, of, muhammad, in, the, history, of, the, prophets, thus, gaining, polemical, superiority, over, jews, and, christians, preservation, of, arab, national, pride, in, the, face, of, confrontation, with, the, iranian, shu, ubiyya, movement, etc, in, a, different, line, the, miracle, claim, that, the, quran, was, encrypted, using, the, number, 19, was, put, forward, by, rashad, khalifa, the, claim, attracted, criticism, because, it, included, claims, against, the, integrity, of, the, text, which, is, mostly, accepted, by, muslims, and, the, khalifa, was, killed, by, his, own, student, in, an, assassination, possibly, organized, by, a, sunni, radical, group, quran, says, we, have, sent, down, the, quran, in, truth, and, with, the, truth, it, has, come, down, and, frequently, asserts, in, its, text, that, it, is, divinely, ordained, the, quran, speaks, of, a, written, pre, text, that, records, god, s, speech, before, it, is, sent, down, the, preserved, tablet, that, is, the, basis, of, the, belief, in, fate, also, and, muslims, believe, that, the, quran, was, sent, down, or, started, to, be, sent, down, on, the, laylat, al, qadr, revered, by, pious, muslims, as, the, holy, of, holies, whose, sound, moves, some, to, tears, and, ecstasy, it, is, the, physical, symbol, of, the, faith, the, text, often, used, as, a, charm, on, occasions, of, birth, death, marriage, traditionally, before, starting, to, read, the, quran, ablution, is, performed, one, seeks, refuge, in, allah, from, the, accursed, satan, and, the, reading, begins, by, mentioning, the, names, of, allah, rahman, and, rahim, together, known, as, basmala, consequently, it, must, never, rest, beneath, other, books, but, always, on, top, of, them, one, must, never, drink, or, smoke, when, it, is, being, read, aloud, and, it, must, be, listened, to, in, silence, it, is, a, talisman, against, disease, and, disaster, according, to, islam, the, quran, is, the, word, of, god, kal, m, all, h, its, nature, and, whether, it, was, created, became, a, matter, of, fierce, debate, among, religious, scholars, and, with, the, involvement, of, the, political, authority, in, the, discussions, some, muslim, religious, scholars, who, stood, against, the, political, stance, faced, religious, persecution, during, the, caliph, al, ma, mun, period, and, the, following, years, muslims, believe, that, the, present, quranic, text, corresponds, to, that, revealed, to, muhammad, and, according, to, their, interpretation, of, quran, 15, 9, it, is, protected, from, corruption, indeed, it, is, we, who, sent, down, the, quran, and, indeed, we, will, be, its, guardians, muslims, consider, the, quran, to, be, a, sign, of, the, prophethood, of, muhammad, and, the, truth, of, the, religion, for, this, reason, in, traditional, islamic, societies, great, importance, was, given, to, children, memorizing, the, quran, and, those, who, memorized, the, entire, quran, were, honored, with, the, title, of, hafiz, even, today, millions, of, muslims, frequently, refer, to, the, quran, to, justify, their, actions, and, desires, and, see, it, as, the, source, of, scientific, knowledge, though, some, refer, to, it, as, weird, or, pseudoscience, muslims, believe, the, quran, to, be, god, s, literal, words, a, complete, code, of, life, the, final, revelation, to, humanity, a, work, of, divine, guidance, revealed, to, muhammad, through, the, angel, gabriel, on, the, other, hand, it, is, believed, in, muslim, community, that, full, understanding, of, it, can, only, be, possible, with, the, depths, obtained, in, the, basic, and, religious, sciences, that, the, ulema, imams, in, shia, might, access, as, heirs, of, the, prophets, for, this, reason, direct, reading, of, the, quran, or, applications, based, on, its, literal, translations, are, considered, problematic, except, for, some, groups, such, as, quranists, thinking, that, the, quran, is, a, complete, and, clear, book, and, tafsir, fiqh, are, brought, fore, to, correct, understandings, in, it, with, a, classical, approach, scholars, will, discuss, verses, of, the, qur, an, in, context, called, asbab, al, nuzul, in, islamic, literature, as, well, as, language, and, linguistics, will, pass, it, through, filters, such, as, muhkam, and, mutashabih, nas, kh, and, abrogated, will, open, the, closed, expressions, and, try, to, guide, the, believers, there, is, no, standardization, in, qur, an, translations, and, interpretations, range, from, traditional, scholastic, to, literalist, salafist, understandings, to, esoteric, sufist, to, modern, and, secular, exegesis, according, to, the, personal, scientific, depth, and, tendencies, of, scholars, sura, al, fatiha, the, first, chapter, of, the, quran, is, recited, in, full, in, every, rakat, of, salah, and, on, other, occasions, this, sura, which, consists, of, seven, verses, is, the, most, often, recited, sura, of, the, quran, in, the, name, of, allah, the, entirely, merciful, the, especially, merciful, praise, is, to, allah, lord, of, the, worlds, the, entirely, merciful, the, especially, merciful, sovereign, of, the, day, of, recompense, it, is, you, we, worship, and, you, we, ask, for, help, guide, us, to, the, straight, path, the, path, of, those, upon, whom, you, have, bestowed, favor, not, of, those, who, have, evoked, anger, or, of, those, who, are, astray, other, sections, of, the, quran, of, choice, are, also, read, in, daily, prayers, sura, al, ikhl, is, second, in, frequency, of, qur, an, recitation, for, according, to, many, early, authorities, muhammad, said, that, ikhl, is, equivalent, to, one, third, of, the, whole, quran, say, o, prophet, he, is, god, one, and, indivisible, god, the, sustainer, needed, by, all, he, has, never, had, offspring, nor, was, he, born, and, there, is, none, comparable, to, him, respect, for, the, written, text, of, the, quran, is, an, important, element, of, religious, faith, by, many, muslims, and, the, quran, is, treated, with, reverence, based, on, tradition, and, a, literal, interpretation, of, quran, 56, 79, none, shall, touch, but, those, who, are, clean, some, muslims, believe, that, they, must, perform, a, ritual, cleansing, with, water, wudu, or, ghusl, before, touching, a, copy, of, the, quran, although, this, view, is, not, universal, worn, out, copies, of, the, quran, are, wrapped, in, a, cloth, and, stored, indefinitely, in, a, safe, place, buried, in, a, mosque, or, a, muslim, cemetery, or, burned, and, the, ashes, buried, or, scattered, over, water, while, praying, the, quran, is, only, recited, in, arabic, in, islam, most, intellectual, disciplines, including, islamic, theology, philosophy, mysticism, and, jurisprudence, have, been, concerned, with, the, quran, or, have, their, foundation, in, its, teachings, muslims, believe, that, the, preaching, or, reading, of, the, quran, is, rewarded, with, divine, rewards, variously, called, ajr, thawab, or, hasanat, the, quran, also, inspired, islamic, arts, and, specifically, the, so, called, quranic, arts, of, calligraphy, and, illumination, the, quran, is, never, decorated, with, figurative, images, but, many, qurans, have, been, highly, decorated, with, decorative, patterns, in, the, margins, of, the, page, or, between, the, lines, or, at, the, start, of, suras, islamic, verses, appear, in, many, other, media, on, buildings, and, on, objects, of, all, sizes, such, as, mosque, lamps, metal, work, pottery, and, single, pages, of, calligraphy, for, muraqqas, or, albums, the, quran, has, sparked, much, commentary, and, explication, tafsir, aimed, at, explaining, the, meanings, of, the, quranic, verses, clarifying, their, import, and, finding, out, their, significance, because, the, quran, is, spoken, in, classical, arabic, many, of, the, later, converts, to, islam, mostly, non, arabs, did, not, always, understand, the, quranic, arabic, they, did, not, catch, intense, allusions, that, were, clear, to, early, muslims, fluent, in, arabic, and, they, were, concerned, with, reconciling, apparent, conflict, of, themes, in, the, quran, commentators, erudite, in, arabic, explained, the, allusions, and, perhaps, most, importantly, explained, which, quranic, verses, had, been, revealed, early, in, muhammad, s, prophetic, career, as, being, appropriate, to, the, very, earliest, muslim, community, and, which, had, been, revealed, later, canceling, out, or, abrogating, n, sikh, the, earlier, text, mans, kh, other, scholars, however, maintain, that, no, abrogation, has, taken, place, in, the, quran, tafsir, is, one, of, the, earliest, academic, activities, of, muslims, according, to, the, quran, muhammad, was, the, first, person, who, described, the, meanings, of, verses, for, early, muslims, other, early, exegetes, included, the, first, four, caliphs, abu, bakr, umar, uthman, and, ali, along, with, a, number, of, muhammad, s, companions, including, abd, allah, ibn, al, abbas, abd, allah, ibn, mas, ud, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, ubayy, ibn, ka, b, and, zayd, ibn, thabit, exegesis, in, those, days, was, confined, to, the, explanation, of, literary, aspects, of, the, verse, the, background, of, its, revelation, and, occasionally, interpretation, of, one, verse, with, the, help, of, the, other, if, the, verse, was, about, a, historical, event, then, sometimes, a, few, traditions, hadith, of, muhammad, were, narrated, to, make, its, meaning, clear, in, addition, the, words, of, the, companions, their, followers, and, followers, of, followers, many, judeo, christian, stories, called, isra, iliyyat, and, apocrypha, were, added, to, explanations, in, later, periods, and, schools, of, exegesis, were, formed, criticizing, each, other, s, sources, and, methodology, there, have, been, several, commentaries, of, the, quran, by, scholars, of, all, denominations, popular, ones, include, tafsir, ibn, kathir, tafsir, al, jalalayn, tafsir, al, kabir, tafsir, al, tabari, more, modern, works, of, tafsir, include, ma, ariful, qur, an, written, by, mufti, muhammad, shafi, and, risale, i, nur, by, bedi, zzaman, said, nursi, esoteric, or, sufi, interpretation, attempts, to, unveil, the, inner, meanings, of, the, quran, sufism, moves, beyond, the, apparent, zahir, point, of, the, verses, and, instead, relates, quranic, verses, to, the, inner, or, esoteric, batin, and, metaphysical, dimensions, of, consciousness, and, existence, according, to, sands, esoteric, interpretations, are, more, suggestive, than, declarative, they, are, allusions, isharat, rather, than, explanations, tafsir, they, indicate, possibilities, as, much, as, they, demonstrate, the, insights, of, each, writer, sufi, interpretation, according, to, annabel, keeler, also, exemplifies, the, use, of, the, theme, of, love, as, for, instance, can, be, seen, in, qushayri, s, interpretation, of, the, quran, when, moses, came, at, the, appointed, time, and, his, lord, spoke, to, him, he, asked, my, lord, reveal, yourself, to, me, so, i, may, see, you, allah, answered, you, cannot, see, me, but, look, at, the, mountain, if, it, remains, firm, in, its, place, only, then, will, you, see, me, when, his, lord, appeared, to, the, mountain, he, levelled, it, to, dust, and, moses, collapsed, unconscious, when, he, recovered, he, cried, glory, be, to, you, i, turn, to, you, in, repentance, and, i, am, the, first, of, the, believers, moses, in, 7, 143, comes, the, way, of, those, who, are, in, love, he, asks, for, a, vision, but, his, desire, is, denied, he, is, made, to, suffer, by, being, commanded, to, look, at, other, than, the, beloved, while, the, mountain, is, able, to, see, god, the, mountain, crumbles, and, moses, faints, at, the, sight, of, god, s, manifestation, upon, the, mountain, in, qushayri, s, words, moses, came, like, thousands, of, men, who, traveled, great, distances, and, there, was, nothing, left, to, moses, of, moses, in, that, state, of, annihilation, from, himself, moses, was, granted, the, unveiling, of, the, realities, from, the, sufi, point, of, view, god, is, the, always, the, beloved, and, the, wayfarer, s, longing, and, suffering, lead, to, realization, of, the, truths, muhammad, husayn, tabataba, i, says, that, according, to, the, popular, explanation, among, the, later, exegetes, ta, wil, indicates, the, particular, meaning, a, verse, is, directed, towards, the, meaning, of, revelation, tanzil, as, opposed, to, ta, wil, is, clear, in, its, accordance, to, the, obvious, meaning, of, the, words, as, they, were, revealed, but, this, explanation, has, become, so, widespread, that, at, present, it, has, become, the, primary, meaning, of, ta, wil, which, originally, meant, to, return, or, the, returning, place, in, tabatabaei, s, view, what, has, been, rightly, called, ta, wil, or, hermeneutic, interpretation, of, the, quran, is, not, concerned, simply, with, the, denotation, of, words, rather, it, is, concerned, with, certain, truths, and, realities, that, transcend, the, comprehension, of, the, common, run, of, men, yet, it, is, from, these, truths, and, realities, that, the, principles, of, doctrine, and, the, practical, injunctions, of, the, quran, issue, forth, interpretation, is, not, the, meaning, of, the, verse, rather, it, transpires, through, that, meaning, in, a, special, sort, of, transpiration, there, is, a, spiritual, reality, which, is, the, main, objective, of, ordaining, a, law, or, the, basic, aim, in, describing, a, divine, attribute, and, then, there, is, an, actual, significance, that, a, quranic, story, refers, to, according, to, shia, beliefs, those, who, are, firmly, rooted, in, knowledge, like, muhammad, and, the, imams, know, the, secrets, of, the, quran, according, to, tabatabaei, the, statement, none, knows, its, interpretation, except, god, remains, valid, without, any, opposing, or, qualifying, clause, therefore, so, far, as, this, verse, is, concerned, the, knowledge, of, the, quran, s, interpretation, is, reserved, for, god, but, tabatabaei, uses, other, verses, and, concludes, that, those, who, are, purified, by, god, know, the, interpretation, of, the, quran, to, a, certain, extent, according, to, tabatabaei, there, are, acceptable, and, unacceptable, esoteric, interpretations, acceptable, ta, wil, refers, to, the, meaning, of, a, verse, beyond, its, literal, meaning, rather, the, implicit, meaning, which, ultimately, is, known, only, to, god, and, can, not, be, comprehended, directly, through, human, thought, alone, the, verses, in, question, here, refer, to, the, human, qualities, of, coming, going, sitting, satisfaction, anger, and, sorrow, which, are, apparently, attributed, to, god, unacceptable, ta, wil, is, where, one, transfers, the, apparent, meaning, of, a, verse, to, a, different, meaning, by, means, of, a, proof, this, method, is, not, without, obvious, inconsistencies, although, this, unacceptable, ta, wil, has, gained, considerable, acceptance, it, is, incorrect, and, cannot, be, applied, to, the, quranic, verses, the, correct, interpretation, is, that, reality, a, verse, refers, to, it, is, found, in, all, verses, the, decisive, and, the, ambiguous, alike, it, is, not, a, sort, of, a, meaning, of, the, word, it, is, a, fact, that, is, too, sublime, for, words, god, has, dressed, them, with, words, to, bring, them, a, bit, nearer, to, our, minds, in, this, respect, they, are, like, proverbs, that, are, used, to, create, a, picture, in, the, mind, and, thus, help, the, hearer, to, clearly, grasp, the, intended, idea, one, of, the, notable, authors, of, esoteric, interpretation, prior, to, the, 12th, century, is, sulami, d, 1021, without, whose, work, the, majority, of, very, early, sufi, commentaries, would, not, have, been, preserved, sulami, s, major, commentary, is, a, book, named, haqaiq, al, tafsir, truths, of, exegesis, which, is, a, compilation, of, commentaries, of, earlier, sufis, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, several, other, works, appear, including, commentaries, by, qushayri, d, 1074, daylami, d, 1193, shirazi, d, 1209, and, suhrawardi, d, 1234, these, works, include, material, from, sulami, s, books, plus, the, author, s, contributions, many, works, are, written, in, persian, such, as, the, works, of, maybudi, d, 1135, kashf, al, asrar, the, unveiling, of, the, secrets, rumi, d, 1273, wrote, a, vast, amount, of, mystical, poetry, in, his, book, mathnawi, rumi, makes, heavy, use, of, the, quran, in, his, poetry, a, feature, that, is, sometimes, omitted, in, translations, of, rumi, s, work, a, large, number, of, quranic, passages, can, be, found, in, mathnawi, which, some, consider, a, kind, of, sufi, interpretation, of, the, quran, rumi, s, book, is, not, exceptional, for, containing, citations, from, and, elaboration, on, the, quran, however, rumi, does, mention, quran, more, frequently, simnani, d, 1336, wrote, two, influential, works, of, esoteric, exegesis, on, the, quran, he, reconciled, notions, of, god, s, manifestation, through, and, in, the, physical, world, with, the, sentiments, of, sunni, islam, comprehensive, sufi, commentaries, appear, in, the, 18th, century, such, as, the, work, of, ismail, hakki, bursevi, d, 1725, his, work, ruh, al, bayan, the, spirit, of, elucidation, is, a, voluminous, exegesis, written, in, arabic, it, combines, the, author, s, own, ideas, with, those, of, his, predecessors, notably, ibn, arabi, and, ghazali, unlike, the, salafis, shias, and, sunnis, as, well, as, some, other, muslim, philosophers, believe, the, meaning, of, the, quran, is, not, restricted, to, the, literal, aspect, 7, for, them, it, is, an, essential, idea, that, the, quran, also, has, inward, aspects, henry, corbin, narrates, a, hadith, that, goes, back, to, muhammad, the, quran, possesses, an, external, appearance, and, a, hidden, depth, an, exoteric, meaning, and, an, esoteric, meaning, this, esoteric, meaning, in, turn, conceals, an, esoteric, meaning, this, depth, possesses, a, depth, after, the, image, of, the, celestial, spheres, which, are, enclosed, within, each, other, so, it, goes, on, for, seven, esoteric, meanings, seven, depths, of, hidden, depth, 7, according, to, this, view, it, has, also, become, evident, that, the, inner, meaning, of, the, quran, does, not, eradicate, or, invalidate, its, outward, meaning, rather, it, is, like, the, soul, which, gives, life, to, the, body, corbin, considers, the, quran, to, play, a, part, in, islamic, philosophy, because, gnosiology, itself, goes, hand, in, hand, with, prophetology, 13, commentaries, dealing, with, the, zahir, outward, aspects, of, the, text, are, called, tafsir, and, hermeneutic, and, esoteric, commentaries, dealing, with, the, batin, are, called, ta, wil, interpretation, or, explanation, which, involves, taking, the, text, back, to, its, beginning, commentators, with, an, esoteric, slant, believe, that, the, ultimate, meaning, of, the, quran, is, known, only, to, god, in, contrast, quranic, literalism, followed, by, salafis, and, zahiris, is, the, belief, that, the, quran, should, only, be, taken, at, its, apparent, meaning, reappropriation, is, the, name, of, the, hermeneutical, style, of, some, ex, muslims, who, have, converted, to, christianity, their, style, or, reinterpretation, can, sometimes, be, geared, towards, apologetics, with, less, reference, to, the, islamic, scholarly, tradition, that, contextualizes, and, systematizes, the, reading, e, g, by, identifying, some, verses, as, abrogated, this, tradition, of, interpretation, draws, on, the, following, practices, grammatical, renegotiation, renegotiation, of, textual, preference, retrieval, and, concession, translating, the, quran, has, always, been, problematic, and, difficult, many, argue, that, the, quranic, text, cannot, be, reproduced, in, another, language, or, form, an, arabic, word, may, have, a, range, of, meanings, depending, on, the, context, making, an, accurate, translation, difficult, moreover, one, of, the, biggest, difficulties, in, understanding, the, quran, for, those, who, do, not, know, its, language, in, the, face, of, shifts, in, linguistic, usage, over, the, centuries, is, semantic, translations, meanings, that, include, the, translator, s, contributions, to, the, relevant, text, instead, of, literal, ones, although, the, author, s, contributions, are, often, bracketed, and, shown, separately, the, author, s, individual, tendencies, may, also, come, to, the, fore, in, making, sense, of, the, main, text, these, studies, contain, reflections, and, even, distortions, caused, by, the, region, sect, education, ideology, and, knowledge, of, the, people, who, made, them, and, efforts, to, reach, the, real, content, are, drowned, in, the, details, of, volumes, of, commentaries, these, distortions, can, manifest, themselves, in, many, areas, of, belief, and, practices, islamic, tradition, also, holds, that, translations, were, made, for, negus, of, abyssinia, and, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, as, both, received, letters, by, muhammad, containing, verses, from, the, quran, in, early, centuries, the, permissibility, of, translations, was, not, an, issue, but, whether, one, could, use, translations, in, prayer, the, quran, has, been, translated, into, most, african, asian, and, european, languages, the, first, translator, of, the, quran, was, salman, the, persian, who, translated, surat, al, fatiha, into, persian, during, the, seventh, century, another, translation, of, the, quran, was, completed, in, 884, in, alwar, sindh, india, now, pakistan, by, the, orders, of, abdullah, bin, umar, bin, abdul, aziz, on, the, request, of, the, hindu, raja, mehruk, the, first, fully, attested, complete, translations, of, the, quran, were, done, between, the, 10th, and, 12th, centuries, in, persian, the, samanid, king, mansur, i, 961, 976, ordered, a, group, of, scholars, from, khorasan, to, translate, the, tafsir, al, tabari, originally, in, arabic, into, persian, later, in, the, 11th, century, one, of, the, students, of, abu, mansur, abdullah, al, ansari, wrote, a, complete, tafsir, of, the, quran, in, persian, in, the, 12th, century, najm, al, din, abu, hafs, al, nasafi, translated, the, quran, into, persian, the, manuscripts, of, all, three, books, have, survived, and, have, been, published, several, times, in, 1936, translations, in, 102, languages, were, known, in, 2010, the, h, rriyet, daily, news, and, economic, review, reported, that, the, quran, was, presented, in, 112, languages, at, the, 18th, international, quran, exhibition, in, tehran, robert, of, ketton, s, 1143, translation, of, the, quran, for, peter, the, venerable, lex, mahumet, pseudoprophete, was, the, first, into, a, western, language, latin, alexander, ross, offered, the, first, english, version, in, 1649, from, the, french, translation, of, l, alcoran, de, mahomet, 1647, by, andre, du, ryer, in, 1734, george, sale, produced, the, first, scholarly, translation, of, the, quran, into, english, another, was, produced, by, richard, bell, in, 1937, and, yet, another, by, arthur, john, arberry, in, 1955, all, these, translators, were, non, muslims, there, have, been, numerous, translations, by, muslims, popular, modern, english, translations, by, muslims, include, the, oxford, world, classic, s, translation, by, muhammad, abdel, haleem, the, clear, quran, by, mustafa, khattab, sahih, international, s, translation, among, various, others, as, with, translations, of, the, bible, the, english, translators, have, sometimes, favored, archaic, english, words, and, constructions, over, their, more, modern, or, conventional, equivalents, for, example, two, widely, read, translators, abdullah, yusuf, ali, and, marmaduke, pickthall, use, the, plural, and, singular, ye, and, thou, instead, of, the, more, common, you, the, oldest, gurmukhi, translation, of, the, quran, sharif, has, been, found, in, village, lande, of, moga, district, of, punjab, which, was, printed, in, 1911, the, proper, recitation, of, the, quran, is, the, subject, of, a, separate, discipline, named, tajwid, which,

by, ibn, al, jazari, and, tuhfat, al, atfal, by, sulayman, al, jamzuri, the, recitations, of, a, few, egyptian, reciters, like, el, minshawy, al, hussary, abdul, basit, mustafa, ismail, were, highly,

subtypes, including, internal, vowels, long, vowels, gemination, shaddah, assimilation, and, alternation, it, is, generally, stated, that, there, are, small, differences, between, readings, however, these, small, changes, may, also, include, differences, that, may, lead, to, serious, differences, in, islam, ranging, from, the, definition, of, god, to, practices, such, as, the, formal, conditions, of, ablution, the, first, quranic, manuscripts, lacked, marks, enabling, multiple, possible, recitations, to, be, conveyed, by, the, same, written, text, the, 10th, century, muslim, scholar, from, baghdad, ibn, muj, hid, is, famous, for, establishing, seven, acceptable, textual, readings, of, the, quran, he, studied, various, readings, and, their, trustworthiness, and, chose, seven, 8th, century, readers, from, the, cities, of, mecca, medina, kufa, basra, and, damascus, ibn, mujahid, did, not, explain, why, he, chose, seven, readers, rather, than, six, or, ten, but, this, may, be, related, to, a, prophetic, tradition, muhammad, s, saying, reporting, that, the, quran, had, been, revealed, in, seven, ahruf, today, the, most, popular, readings, are, those, transmitted, by, af, d, 796, and, warsh, d, 812, which, are, according, to, two, of, ibn, mujahid, s, reciters, aasim, ibn, abi, al, najud, kufa, d, 745, and, nafi, al, madani, medina, d, 785, respectively, the, influential,

lifetimes, of, the, last, sahabah, before, printing, was, widely, adopted, in, the, 19th, century, the, quran, was, transmitted, in, manuscripts, made, by, calligraphers, and, copyists, the, earliest, manuscripts, were, written, in, ij, z, typescript, the, hijazi, style, manuscripts, nevertheless, confirm, that, transmission, of, the, quran, in, writing, began, at, an, early, stage, probably, in, the, ninth, century, scripts, began, to, feature, thicker, strokes, which, are, traditionally, known, as, kufic, scripts, toward, the, end, of, the, ninth, century, new, scripts, began, to, appear, in, copies, of, the, quran, and, replace, earlier, scripts, the, reason, for, discontinuation, in, the, use, of, the, earlier, style, was, that, it, took, too, long, to, produce, and, the, demand, for, copies, was, increasing, copyists, would, therefore, choose, simpler, writing, styles, beginning, in, the, 11th, century, the, styles, of, writing, employed, were, primarily, the, naskh, muhaqqaq, ray, n, and, on, rarer, occasions, the, thuluth, script, naskh, was, in, very, widespread, use, in, north, africa, and, iberia, the, maghrib, style, was, popular, more, distinct, is, the, bihari, script, which, was, used, solely, in, the, north, of, india, nasta, l, q, style, was, also, rarely, used, in, persian, world, in, the, beginning, the, quran, was, not, written, with, dots, or, tashkeel, these, features, were, added, to, the, text, during, the, lifetimes, of, the, last, of, the, sahabah, since, it, would, have, been, too, costly, for, most, muslims, to, purchase, a, manuscript, copies, of, the, quran, were, held, in, mosques, in, order, to, make, them, accessible, to, people, these, copies, frequently, took, the, form, of, a, series, of, 30, parts, or, juz, in, terms, of, productivity, the, ottoman, copyists, provide, the, best, example, this, was, in, response, to, widespread, demand, unpopularity, of, printing, methods, and, for, aesthetic, reasons, whilst, the, majority, of, islamic, scribes, were, men, some, women, also, worked, as, scholars, and, copyists, one, such, woman, who, made, a, copy, of, this, text, was, the, moroccan, jurist, amina,

empire, between, 1483, and, 1726, initially, even, on, penalty, of, death, the, ottoman, ban, on, printing, in, arabic, script, was, lifted, in, 1726, for, non, religious, texts, only, upon, the, request, of, ibrahim, muteferrika, who, printed, his, first, book, in, 1729, except, for, books, in, hebrew, and, european, languages, which, were, unrestricted, very, few, books, and, no, religious,

edition, of, the, quran, in, 1834, in, leipzig, which, remained, authoritative, in, europe, for, close, to, a, century, until, cairo, s, al, azhar, university, published, an, edition, of, the, quran, in, 1924, this, edition, was, the, result, of, a, long, preparation, as, it, standardized, quranic, orthography, and, it, remains, the, basis, of, later, editions, regarding, the, claim, of, divine, origin, critics, refer, to, preexisting, sources, not, only, taken, from, the, bible, supposed, to, be, older, revelations, of, god, but, also, from, heretic, apocryphic, and, talmudic, sources, such, as, the, syriac, infancy, gospel, and, gospel, of, james, the, quran, acknowledges, that, accusations, of, borrowing, popular, ancient, fables, were, being, made, against, muhammad, due, to, its, rejection, of, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, some, scholars, also, suspect, influences, by, manichaeaism, a, dualistic, religion, believing, in, two, eternal, forces, on, the, quran, the, chinese,

the, prophet, founder, of, the, bah, faith, testified, to, the, validity, of, the, quran, writing, say, perused, ye, not, the, qur, n, read, it, that, haply, ye, may, find, the, truth, for, this, book, is, verily, the, straight, path, this, is, the, way, of, god, unto, all, who, are, in, the, heavens, and, all, who, are, on, the, earth, unitarian, universalists, may, also, seek, inspiration, from, the, quran, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, quran, has, some, narrative, similarities, to, the, diatessaron, protoevangelium, of, james, infancy, gospel, of, thomas, gospel, of, pseudo, matthew, and, the, arabic, infancy, gospel, one, scholar, has, suggested, that, the, diatessaron, as, a, gospel, harmony, may, have, led, to, the, conception, that, the, christian, gospel, is, one, text, he, has, revealed, to, you, o, prophet, the, book, in, truth, confirming, what, came, before, it, as, he, revealed, the, torah, and, the, gospel, previously, as, a, guide, for, people, and, also, revealed, the, standard, to, distinguish, between, right, and, wrong, the, quran, attributes, its, relationship, with, former, books, the, torah, and, the, gospels, to, their, unique, origin,

zechariah, john, the, baptist, and, jesus, are, mentioned, in, the, quran, as, prophets, of, god, see, prophets, of, islam, in, fact, moses, is, mentioned, more, in, the, quran, than, any, other, individual, jesus, is, mentioned, more, often, in, the, quran, than, muhammad, by, name, muhammad, is, often, alluded, to, as, the, prophet, or, the, apostle, while, mary, is, mentioned, in, the, quran, more, than, in, the, new, testament, after, the, quran, and, the, general, rise, of, islam, the, arabic, alphabet, developed, rapidly, into, an, art, form, the, arabic, grammarian, sibawayh, wrote, one, of, the, earliest, books, on, arabic, grammar, referred, to, as, al, kitab, which, relied, heavily, on, the, language, in, the, quran, wadad, kadi, professor, of, near, eastern, languages, and, civilizations, at, university, of, chicago, and, mustansir, mir, professor, of, islamic, studies, at, youngstown, state, university, state, that, the, quran, exerted, a, particular, influence, on, arabic, literature, s, diction, themes, metaphors, motifs, and, symbols, and, added, new, expressions, and, new, meanings, to, old, pre, islamic, words, that, would, become, ubiquitous, the, first, of, those, to, collect, the, qur, an, into, a, mushaf, codex, was, salim, the, freed, slave, of, abu, hudhaifah, since, the, word, of, god, seemed, threatened, with, alteration, the, caliph, ordered, that, five, of, the, qurr, from, amongst, the, companions, one, of, them, being, zayd, ibn, th, bit, who, had, compiled, the, first, volume, produce, other, copies, from, the, first, volume, which, had, been, prepared, on, the, orders, of, the, first, caliph, and, which, had, been, kept, with, af, ah, the, wife, of, the, prophet, and, daughter, of, the, second, caliph, the, other, copies, already, in, the, hands, of, muslims, in, other, areas, were, collected, and, sent, to, medina, where, on, orders, of, the, caliph, they, were, burnt, or, according, to, some, historians, were, destroyed, by, boiling, thus, several, copies, were, made, one, being, kept, in, medina, one, in, mecca, and, one, each, sent, to, sham, a, territory, now, divided, into, syria, lebanon, palestine, and, jordan, kufa, and, basra, it, is, said, that, beside, these, five, one, copy, was, also, sent, to, yemen, and, one, to, bahrein, these, copies, were, called, the, imam, copies, and, served, as, original, for, all, future, copies, the, only, difference, of, order, between, these, copies, and, the, first, volume, was, that, the, chapters, spirits, of, war, and, immunity, were, written, in, one, place, between, the, heights, and, jonah
