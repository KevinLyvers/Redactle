in, analytic, philosophy, philosophy, of, language, investigates, the, nature, of, language, and, the, relations, between, language, language, users, and, the, world, investigations, may, include, inquiry, into, the, nature, of, meaning, intentionality, reference, the, constitution, of, sentences, concepts, learning, and, thought, gottlob, frege, and, bertrand, russell, were, pivotal, figures, in, analytic, philosophy, s, linguistic, turn, these, writers, were, followed, by, ludwig, wittgenstein, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, the, vienna, circle, logical, positivists, and, willard, van, orman, quine, in, the, west, inquiry, into, language, stretches, back, to, the, 5th, century, bc, with, socrates, plato, aristotle, and, the, stoics, linguistic, speculation, predated, systematic, descriptions, of, grammar, which, emerged, c, the, 5th, century, bc, in, india, and, c, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, greece, in, the, dialogue, cratylus, plato, considered, the, question, of, whether, the, names, of, things, were, determined, by, convention, or, by, nature, he, criticized, conventionalism, because, it, led, to, the, bizarre, consequence, that, anything, can, be, conventionally, denominated, by, any, name, hence, it, cannot, account, for, the, correct, or, incorrect, application, of, a, name, he, claimed, that, there, was, a, natural, correctness, to, names, to, do, this, he, pointed, out, that, compound, words, and, phrases, have, a, range, of, correctness, he, also, argued, that, primitive, names, had, a, natural, correctness, because, each, phoneme, represented, basic, ideas, or, sentiments, for, example, for, plato, the, letter, l, and, its, sound, represented, the, idea, of, softness, however, by, the, end, of, cratylus, he, had, admitted, that, some, social, conventions, were, also, involved, and, that, there, were, faults, in, the, idea, that, phonemes, had, individual, meanings, plato, is, often, considered, a, proponent, of, extreme, realism, aristotle, interested, himself, with, issues, of, logic, categories, and, the, creation, of, meaning, he, separated, all, things, into, categories, of, species, and, genus, he, thought, that, the, meaning, of, a, predicate, was, established, through, an, abstraction, of, the, similarities, between, various, individual, things, this, theory, later, came, to, be, called, nominalism, however, since, aristotle, took, these, similarities, to, be, constituted, by, a, real, commonality, of, form, he, is, more, often, considered, a, proponent, of, moderate, realism, the, stoics, made, important, contributions, to, the, analysis, of, grammar, distinguishing, five, parts, of, speech, nouns, verbs, appellatives, names, or, epithets, conjunctions, and, articles, they, also, developed, a, sophisticated, doctrine, of, the, lekt, n, associated, with, each, sign, of, a, language, but, distinct, from, both, the, sign, itself, and, the, thing, to, which, it, refers, this, lekt, n, was, the, meaning, or, sense, of, every, term, the, complete, lekt, n, of, a, sentence, is, what, we, would, now, call, its, proposition, only, propositions, were, considered, truth, bearing, meaning, they, could, be, considered, true, or, false, while, sentences, were, simply, their, vehicles, of, expression, different, lekt, could, also, express, things, besides, propositions, such, as, commands, questions, and, exclamations, medieval, philosophers, were, greatly, interested, in, the, subtleties, of, language, and, its, usage, for, many, scholastics, this, interest, was, provoked, by, the, necessity, of, translating, greek, texts, into, latin, there, were, several, noteworthy, philosophers, of, language, in, the, medieval, period, according, to, peter, j, king, although, this, has, been, disputed, peter, abelard, anticipated, the, modern, theories, of, reference, also, william, of, ockham, s, summa, logicae, brought, forward, one, of, the, first, serious, proposals, for, codifying, a, mental, language, the, scholastics, of, the, high, medieval, period, such, as, ockham, and, john, duns, scotus, considered, logic, to, be, a, scientia, sermocinalis, science, of, language, the, result, of, their, studies, was, the, elaboration, of, linguistic, philosophical, notions, whose, complexity, and, subtlety, has, only, recently, come, to, be, appreciated, many, of, the, most, interesting, problems, of, modern, philosophy, of, language, were, anticipated, by, medieval, thinkers, the, phenomena, of, vagueness, and, ambiguity, were, analyzed, intensely, and, this, led, to, an, increasing, interest, in, problems, related, to, the, use, of, syncategorematic, words, such, as, and, or, not, if, and, every, the, study, of, categorematic, words, or, terms, and, their, properties, was, also, developed, greatly, one, of, the, major, developments, of, the, scholastics, in, this, area, was, the, doctrine, of, the, suppositio, the, suppositio, of, a, term, is, the, interpretation, that, is, given, of, it, in, a, specific, context, it, can, be, proper, or, improper, as, when, it, is, used, in, metaphor, metonyms, and, other, figures, of, speech, a, proper, suppositio, in, turn, can, be, either, formal, or, material, accordingly, when, it, refers, to, its, usual, non, linguistic, referent, as, in, charles, is, a, man, or, to, itself, as, a, linguistic, entity, as, in, charles, has, seven, letters, such, a, classification, scheme, is, the, precursor, of, modern, distinctions, between, use, and, mention, and, between, language, and, metalanguage, there, is, a, tradition, called, speculative, grammar, which, existed, from, the, 11th, to, the, 13th, century, leading, scholars, included, martin, of, dacia, and, thomas, of, erfurt, see, modistae, linguists, of, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, such, as, johannes, goropius, becanus, athanasius, kircher, and, john, wilkins, were, infatuated, with, the, idea, of, a, philosophical, language, reversing, the, confusion, of, tongues, influenced, by, the, gradual, discovery, of, chinese, characters, and, egyptian, hieroglyphs, hieroglyphica, this, thought, parallels, the, idea, that, there, might, be, a, universal, language, of, music, european, scholarship, began, to, absorb, the, indian, linguistic, tradition, only, from, the, mid, 18th, century, pioneered, by, jean, fran, ois, pons, and, henry, thomas, colebrooke, the, editio, princeps, of, varadar, ja, a, 17th, century, sanskrit, grammarian, dating, to, 1849, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, danish, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, insisted, that, language, ought, to, play, a, larger, role, in, western, philosophy, he, argued, that, philosophy, has, not, sufficiently, focused, on, the, role, language, plays, in, cognition, and, that, future, philosophy, ought, to, proceed, with, a, conscious, focus, on, language, if, the, claim, of, philosophers, to, be, unbiased, were, all, it, pretends, to, be, it, would, also, have, to, take, account, of, language, and, its, whole, significance, in, relation, to, speculative, philosophy, language, is, partly, something, originally, given, partly, that, which, develops, freely, and, just, as, the, individual, can, never, reach, the, point, at, which, he, becomes, absolutely, independent, so, too, with, language, the, phrase, linguistic, turn, was, used, to, describe, the, noteworthy, emphasis, that, contemporary, philosophers, put, upon, language, language, began, to, play, a, central, role, in, western, philosophy, in, the, early, 20th, century, one, of, the, central, figures, involved, in, this, development, was, the, german, philosopher, gottlob, frege, whose, work, on, philosophical, logic, and, the, philosophy, of, language, in, the, late, 19th, century, influenced, the, work, of, 20th, century, analytic, philosophers, bertrand, russell, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, the, philosophy, of, language, became, so, pervasive, that, for, a, time, in, analytic, philosophy, circles, philosophy, as, a, whole, was, understood, to, be, a, matter, of, philosophy, of, language, in, continental, philosophy, the, foundational, work, in, the, field, was, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, cours, de, linguistique, g, n, rale, published, posthumously, in, 1916, the, topic, that, has, received, the, most, attention, in, the, philosophy, of, language, has, been, the, nature, of, meaning, to, explain, what, meaning, is, and, what, we, mean, when, we, talk, about, meaning, within, this, area, issues, include, the, nature, of, synonymy, the, origins, of, meaning, itself, our, apprehension, of, meaning, and, the, nature, of, composition, the, question, of, how, meaningful, units, of, language, are, composed, of, smaller, meaningful, parts, and, how, the, meaning, of, the, whole, is, derived, from, the, meaning, of, its, parts, there, have, been, several, distinctive, explanations, of, what, a, linguistic, meaning, is, each, has, been, associated, with, its, own, body, of, literature, investigations, into, how, language, interacts, with, the, world, are, called, theories, of, reference, gottlob, frege, was, an, advocate, of, a, mediated, reference, theory, frege, divided, the, semantic, content, of, every, expression, including, sentences, into, two, components, sense, and, reference, the, sense, of, a, sentence, is, the, thought, that, it, expresses, such, a, thought, is, abstract, universal, and, objective, the, sense, of, any, sub, sentential, expression, consists, in, its, contribution, to, the, thought, that, its, embedding, sentence, expresses, senses, determine, reference, and, are, also, the, modes, of, presentation, of, the, objects, to, which, expressions, refer, referents, are, the, objects, in, the, world, that, words, pick, out, the, senses, of, sentences, are, thoughts, while, their, referents, are, truth, values, true, or, false, the, referents, of, sentences, embedded, in, propositional, attitude, ascriptions, and, other, opaque, contexts, are, their, usual, senses, bertrand, russell, in, his, later, writings, and, for, reasons, related, to, his, theory, of, acquaintance, in, epistemology, held, that, the, only, directly, referential, expressions, are, what, he, called, logically, proper, names, logically, proper, names, are, such, terms, as, i, now, here, and, other, indexicals, he, viewed, proper, names, of, the, sort, described, above, as, abbreviated, definite, descriptions, see, theory, of, descriptions, hence, joseph, r, biden, may, be, an, abbreviation, for, the, current, president, of, the, united, states, and, husband, of, jill, biden, definite, descriptions, are, denoting, phrases, see, on, denoting, which, are, analyzed, by, russell, into, existentially, quantified, logical, constructions, such, phrases, denote, in, the, sense, that, there, is, an, object, that, satisfies, the, description, however, such, objects, are, not, to, be, considered, meaningful, on, their, own, but, have, meaning, only, in, the, proposition, expressed, by, the, sentences, of, which, they, are, a, part, hence, they, are, not, directly, referential, in, the, same, way, as, logically, proper, names, for, russell, on, frege, s, account, any, referring, expression, has, a, sense, as, well, as, a, referent, such, a, mediated, reference, view, has, certain, theoretical, advantages, over, mill, s, view, for, example, co, referential, names, such, as, samuel, clemens, and, mark, twain, cause, problems, for, a, directly, referential, view, because, it, is, possible, for, someone, to, hear, mark, twain, is, samuel, clemens, and, be, surprised, thus, their, cognitive, content, seems, different, despite, the, differences, between, the, views, of, frege, and, russell, they, are, generally, lumped, together, as, descriptivists, about, proper, names, such, descriptivism, was, criticized, in, saul, kripke, s, naming, and, necessity, kripke, put, forth, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, modal, argument, or, argument, from, rigidity, consider, the, name, aristotle, and, the, descriptions, the, greatest, student, of, plato, the, founder, of, logic, and, the, teacher, of, alexander, aristotle, obviously, satisfies, all, of, the, descriptions, and, many, of, the, others, we, commonly, associate, with, him, but, it, is, not, necessarily, true, that, if, aristotle, existed, then, aristotle, was, any, one, or, all, of, these, descriptions, aristotle, may, well, have, existed, without, doing, any, single, one, of, the, things, for, which, he, is, known, to, posterity, he, may, have, existed, and, not, have, become, known, to, posterity, at, all, or, he, may, have, died, in, infancy, suppose, that, aristotle, is, associated, by, mary, with, the, description, the, last, great, philosopher, of, antiquity, and, the, actual, aristotle, died, in, infancy, then, mary, s, description, would, seem, to, refer, to, plato, but, this, is, deeply, counterintuitive, hence, names, are, rigid, designators, according, to, kripke, that, is, they, refer, to, the, same, individual, in, every, possible, world, in, which, that, individual, exists, in, the, same, work, kripke, articulated, several, other, arguments, against, frege, russell, descriptivism, see, also, kripke, s, causal, theory, of, reference, the, whole, philosophical, enterprise, of, studying, reference, has, been, critiqued, by, linguist, noam, chomsky, in, various, works, it, has, long, been, known, that, there, are, different, parts, of, speech, one, part, of, the, common, sentence, is, the, lexical, word, which, is, composed, of, nouns, verbs, and, adjectives, a, major, question, in, the, field, perhaps, the, single, most, important, question, for, formalist, and, structuralist, thinkers, is, how, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, emerges, from, its, parts, many, aspects, of, the, problem, of, the, composition, of, sentences, are, addressed, in, the, field, of, linguistics, of, syntax, philosophical, semantics, tends, to, focus, on, the, principle, of, compositionality, to, explain, the, relationship, between, meaningful, parts, and, whole, sentences, the, principle, of, compositionality, asserts, that, a, sentence, can, be, understood, on, the, basis, of, the, meaning, of, the, parts, of, the, sentence, i, e, words, morphemes, along, with, an, understanding, of, its, structure, i, e, syntax, logic, further, syntactic, propositions, are, arranged, into, discourse, or, narrative, structures, which, also, encode, meanings, through, pragmatics, like, temporal, relations, and, pronominals, it, is, possible, to, use, the, concept, of, functions, to, describe, more, than, just, how, lexical, meanings, work, they, can, also, be, used, to, describe, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, in, the, sentence, the, horse, is, red, the, horse, can, be, considered, to, be, the, product, of, a, propositional, function, a, propositional, function, is, an, operation, of, language, that, takes, an, entity, in, this, case, the, horse, as, an, input, and, outputs, a, semantic, fact, i, e, the, proposition, that, is, represented, by, the, horse, is, red, in, other, words, a, propositional, function, is, like, an, algorithm, the, meaning, of, red, in, this, case, is, whatever, takes, the, entity, the, horse, and, turns, it, into, the, statement, the, horse, is, red, linguists, have, developed, at, least, two, general, methods, of, understanding, the, relationship, between, the, parts, of, a, linguistic, string, and, how, it, is, put, together, syntactic, and, semantic, trees, syntactic, trees, draw, upon, the, words, of, a, sentence, with, the, grammar, of, the, sentence, in, mind, semantic, trees, focus, upon, the, role, of, the, meaning, of, the, words, and, how, those, meanings, combine, to, provide, insight, onto, the, genesis, of, semantic, facts, some, of, the, major, issues, at, the, intersection, of, philosophy, of, language, and, philosophy, of, mind, are, also, dealt, with, in, modern, psycholinguistics, some, important, questions, regard, the, amount, of, innate, language, if, language, acquisition, is, a, special, faculty, in, the, mind, and, what, the, connection, is, between, thought, and, language, there, are, three, general, perspectives, on, the, issue, of, language, learning, the, first, is, the, behaviorist, perspective, which, dictates, that, not, only, is, the, solid, bulk, of, language, learned, but, it, is, learned, via, conditioning, the, second, is, the, hypothesis, testing, perspective, which, understands, the, child, s, learning, of, syntactic, rules, and, meanings, to, involve, the, postulation, and, testing, of, hypotheses, through, the, use, of, the, general, faculty, of, intelligence, the, final, candidate, for, explanation, is, the, innatist, perspective, which, states, that, at, least, some, of, the, syntactic, settings, are, innate, and, hardwired, based, on, certain, modules, of, the, mind, there, are, varying, notions, of, the, structure, of, the, brain, when, it, comes, to, language, connectionist, models, emphasize, the, idea, that, a, person, s, lexicon, and, their, thoughts, operate, in, a, kind, of, distributed, associative, network, nativist, models, assert, that, there, are, specialized, devices, in, the, brain, that, are, dedicated, to, language, acquisition, computation, models, emphasize, the, notion, of, a, representational, language, of, thought, and, the, logic, like, computational, processing, that, the, mind, performs, over, them, emergentist, models, focus, on, the, notion, that, natural, faculties, are, a, complex, system, that, emerge, from, simpler, biological, parts, reductionist, models, attempt, to, explain, higher, level, mental, processes, in, terms, of, the, basic, low, level, neurophysiological, activity, firstly, this, field, of, study, seeks, to, better, understand, what, speakers, and, listeners, do, with, language, in, communication, and, how, it, is, used, socially, specific, interests, include, the, topics, of, language, learning, language, creation, and, speech, acts, secondly, the, question, of, how, language, relates, to, the, minds, of, both, the, speaker, and, the, interpreter, is, investigated, of, specific, interest, is, the, grounds, for, successful, translation, of, words, and, concepts, into, their, equivalents, in, another, language, an, important, problem, which, touches, both, philosophy, of, language, and, philosophy, of, mind, is, to, what, extent, language, influences, thought, and, vice, versa, there, have, been, a, number, of, different, perspectives, on, this, issue, each, offering, a, number, of, insights, and, suggestions, linguists, sapir, and, whorf, suggested, that, language, limited, the, extent, to, which, members, of, a, linguistic, community, can, think, about, certain, subjects, a, hypothesis, paralleled, in, george, orwell, s, novel, nineteen, eighty, four, in, other, words, language, was, analytically, prior, to, thought, philosopher, michael, dummett, is, also, a, proponent, of, the, language, first, viewpoint, the, stark, opposite, to, the, sapir, whorf, position, is, the, notion, that, thought, or, more, broadly, mental, content, has, priority, over, language, the, knowledge, first, position, can, be, found, for, instance, in, the, work, of, paul, grice, further, this, view, is, closely, associated, with, jerry, fodor, and, his, language, of, thought, hypothesis, according, to, his, argument, spoken, and, written, language, derive, their, intentionality, and, meaning, from, an, internal, language, encoded, in, the, mind, the, main, argument, in, favor, of, such, a, view, is, that, the, structure, of, thoughts, and, the, structure, of, language, seem, to, share, a, compositional, systematic, character, another, argument, is, that, it, is, difficult, to, explain, how, signs, and, symbols, on, paper, can, represent, anything, meaningful, unless, some, sort, of, meaning, is, infused, into, them, by, the, contents, of, the, mind, one, of, the, main, arguments, against, is, that, such, levels, of, language, can, lead, to, an, infinite, regress, in, any, case, many, philosophers, of, mind, and, language, such, as, ruth, millikan, fred, dretske, and, fodor, have, recently, turned, their, attention, to, explaining, the, meanings, of, mental, contents, and, states, directly, another, tradition, of, philosophers, has, attempted, to, show, that, language, and, thought, are, coextensive, that, there, is, no, way, of, explaining, one, without, the, other, donald, davidson, in, his, essay, thought, and, talk, argued, that, the, notion, of, belief, could, only, arise, as, a, product, of, public, linguistic, interaction, daniel, dennett, holds, a, similar, interpretationist, view, of, propositional, attitudes, to, an, extent, the, theoretical, underpinnings, to, cognitive, semantics, including, the, notion, of, semantic, framing, suggest, the, influence, of, language, upon, thought, however, the, same, tradition, views, meaning, and, grammar, as, a, function, of, conceptualization, making, it, difficult, to, assess, in, any, straightforward, way, some, thinkers, like, the, ancient, sophist, gorgias, have, questioned, whether, or, not, language, was, capable, of, capturing, thought, at, all, speech, can, never, exactly, represent, perceptibles, since, it, is, different, from, them, and, perceptibles, are, apprehended, each, by, the, one, kind, of, organ, speech, by, another, hence, since, the, objects, of, sight, cannot, be, presented, to, any, other, organ, but, sight, and, the, different, sense, organs, cannot, give, their, information, to, one, another, similarly, speech, cannot, give, any, information, about, perceptibles, therefore, if, anything, exists, and, is, comprehended, it, is, incommunicable, there, are, studies, that, prove, that, languages, shape, how, people, understand, causality, some, of, them, were, performed, by, lera, boroditsky, for, example, english, speakers, tend, to, say, things, like, john, broke, the, vase, even, for, accidents, however, spanish, or, japanese, speakers, would, be, more, likely, to, say, the, vase, broke, itself, in, studies, conducted, by, caitlin, fausey, at, stanford, university, speakers, of, english, spanish, and, japanese, watched, videos, of, two, people, popping, balloons, breaking, eggs, and, spilling, drinks, either, intentionally, or, accidentally, later, everyone, was, asked, whether, they, could, remember, who, did, what, spanish, and, japanese, speakers, did, not, remember, the, agents, of, accidental, events, as, well, as, did, english, speakers, russian, speakers, who, make, an, extra, distinction, between, light, and, dark, blue, in, their, language, are, better, able, to, visually, discriminate, shades, of, blue, the, piraha, a, tribe, in, brazil, whose, language, has, only, terms, like, few, and, many, instead, of, numerals, are, not, able, to, keep, track, of, exact, quantities, in, one, study, german, and, spanish, speakers, were, asked, to, describe, objects, having, opposite, gender, assignment, in, those, two, languages, the, descriptions, they, gave, differed, in, a, way, predicted, by, grammatical, gender, for, example, when, asked, to, describe, a, key, a, word, that, is, masculine, in, german, and, feminine, in, spanish, the, german, speakers, were, more, likely, to, use, words, like, hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and, useful, whereas, spanish, speakers, were, more, likely, to, say, golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and, tiny, to, describe, a, bridge, which, is, feminine, in, german, and, masculine, in, spanish, the, german, speakers, said, beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and, slender, and, the, spanish, speakers, said, big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and, towering, this, was, the, case, even, though, all, testing, was, done, in, english, a, language, without, grammatical, gender, in, a, series, of, studies, conducted, by, gary, lupyan, people, were, asked, to, look, at, a, series, of, images, of, imaginary, aliens, whether, each, alien, was, friendly, or, hostile, was, determined, by, certain, subtle, features, but, participants, were, not, told, what, these, were, they, had, to, guess, whether, each, alien, was, friendly, or, hostile, and, after, each, response, they, were, told, if, they, were, correct, or, not, helping, them, learn, the, subtle, cues, that, distinguished, friend, from, foe, a, quarter, of, the, participants, were, told, in, advance, that, the, friendly, aliens, were, called, leebish, and, the, hostile, ones, grecious, while, another, quarter, were, told, the, opposite, for, the, rest, the, aliens, remained, nameless, it, was, found, that, participants, who, were, given, names, for, the, aliens, learned, to, categorize, the, aliens, far, more, quickly, reaching, 80, per, cent, accuracy, in, less, than, half, the, time, taken, by, those, not, told, the, names, by, the, end, of, the, test, those, told, the, names, could, correctly, categorize, 88, per, cent, of, aliens, compared, to, just, 80, per, cent, for, the, rest, it, was, concluded, that, naming, objects, helps, us, categorize, and, memorize, them, in, another, series, of, experiments, a, group, of, people, was, asked, to, view, furniture, from, an, ikea, catalog, half, the, time, they, were, asked, to, label, the, object, whether, it, was, a, chair, or, lamp, for, example, while, the, rest, of, the, time, they, had, to, say, whether, or, not, they, liked, it, it, was, found, that, when, asked, to, label, items, people, were, later, less, likely, to, recall, the, specific, details, of, products, such, as, whether, a, chair, had, arms, or, not, it, was, concluded, that, labeling, objects, helps, our, minds, build, a, prototype, of, the, typical, object, in, the, group, at, the, expense, of, individual, features, a, common, claim, is, that, language, is, governed, by, social, conventions, questions, inevitably, arise, on, surrounding, topics, one, question, regards, what, a, convention, exactly, is, and, how, it, is, studied, and, second, regards, the, extent, that, conventions, even, matter, in, the, study, of, language, david, kellogg, lewis, proposed, a, worthy, reply, to, the, first, question, by, expounding, the, view, that, a, convention, is, a, rationally, self, perpetuating, regularity, in, behavior, however, this, view, seems, to, compete, to, some, extent, with, the, gricean, view, of, speaker, s, meaning, requiring, either, one, or, both, to, be, weakened, if, both, are, to, be, taken, as, true, some, have, questioned, whether, or, not, conventions, are, relevant, to, the, study, of, meaning, at, all, noam, chomsky, proposed, that, the, study, of, language, could, be, done, in, terms, of, the, i, language, or, internal, language, of, persons, if, this, is, so, then, it, undermines, the, pursuit, of, explanations, in, terms, of, conventions, and, relegates, such, explanations, to, the, domain, of, metasemantics, metasemantics, is, a, term, used, by, philosopher, of, language, robert, stainton, to, describe, all, those, fields, that, attempt, to, explain, how, semantic, facts, arise, one, fruitful, source, of, research, involves, investigation, into, the, social, conditions, that, give, rise, to, or, are, associated, with, meanings, and, languages, etymology, the, study, of, the, origins, of, words, and, stylistics, philosophical, argumentation, over, what, makes, good, grammar, relative, to, a, particular, language, are, two, other, examples, of, fields, that, are, taken, to, be, metasemantic, many, separate, but, related, fields, have, investigated, the, topic, of, linguistic, convention, within, their, own, research, paradigms, the, presumptions, that, prop, up, each, theoretical, view, are, of, interest, to, the, philosopher, of, language, for, instance, one, of, the, major, fields, of, sociology, symbolic, interactionism, is, based, on, the, insight, that, human, social, organization, is, based, almost, entirely, on, the, use, of, meanings, in, consequence, any, explanation, of, a, social, structure, like, an, institution, would, need, to, account, for, the, shared, meanings, which, create, and, sustain, the, structure, rhetoric, is, the, study, of, the, particular, words, that, people, use, to, achieve, the, proper, emotional, and, rational, effect, in, the, listener, be, it, to, persuade, provoke, endear, or, teach, some, relevant, applications, of, the, field, include, the, examination, of, propaganda, and, didacticism, the, examination, of, the, purposes, of, swearing, and, pejoratives, especially, how, it, influences, the, behaviors, of, others, and, defines, relationships, or, the, effects, of, gendered, language, it, can, also, be, used, to, study, linguistic, transparency, or, speaking, in, an, accessible, manner, as, well, as, performative, utterances, and, the, various, tasks, that, language, can, perform, called, speech, acts, it, also, has, applications, to, the, study, and, interpretation, of, law, and, helps, give, insight, to, the, logical, concept, of, the, domain, of, discourse, literary, theory, is, a, discipline, that, some, literary, theorists, claim, overlaps, with, the, philosophy, of, language, it, emphasizes, the, methods, that, readers, and, critics, use, in, understanding, a, text, this, field, an, outgrowth, of, the, study, of, how, to, properly, interpret, messages, is, closely, tied, to, the, ancient, discipline, of, hermeneutics, finally, philosophers, of, language, investigate, how, language, and, meaning, relate, to, truth, and, the, reality, being, referred, to, they, tend, to, be, less, interested, in, which, sentences, are, actually, true, and, more, in, what, kinds, of, meanings, can, be, true, or, false, a, truth, oriented, philosopher, of, language, might, wonder, whether, or, not, a, meaningless, sentence, can, be, true, or, false, or, whether, or, not, sentences, can, express, propositions, about, things, that, do, not, exist, rather, than, the, way, sentences, are, used, in, the, philosophical, tradition, stemming, from, the, ancient, greeks, such, as, plato, and, aristotle, language, is, seen, as, a, tool, for, making, statements, about, the, reality, by, means, of, predication, e, g, man, is, a, rational, animal, where, man, is, the, subject, and, is, a, rational, animal, is, the, predicate, which, expresses, a, property, of, the, subject, such, structures, also, constitute, the, syntactic, basis, of, syllogism, which, remained, the, standard, model, of, formal, logic, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, it, was, replaced, with, predicate, logic, in, linguistics, and, philosophy, of, language, the, classical, model, survived, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, link, between, aristotelian, philosophy, of, science, and, linguistics, was, elaborated, by, thomas, of, erfurt, s, modistae, grammar, c, 1305, which, gives, an, example, of, the, analysis, of, the, transitive, sentence, plato, strikes, socrates, where, socrates, is, the, object, and, part, of, the, predicate, the, social, and, evolutionary, aspects, of, language, were, discussed, during, the, classical, and, mediaeval, periods, plato, s, dialogue, cratylus, investigates, the, iconicity, of, words, arguing, that, words, are, made, by, wordsmiths, and, selected, by, those, who, need, the, words, and, that, the, study, of, language, is, external, to, the, philosophical, objective, of, studying, ideas, age, of, enlightenment, thinkers, accommodated, the, classical, model, with, a, christian, worldview, arguing, that, god, created, man, social, and, rational, and, out, of, these, properties, man, created, his, own, cultural, habits, including, language, in, this, tradition, the, logic, of, the, subject, predicate, structure, forms, a, general, or, universal, grammar, which, governs, thinking, and, underpins, all, languages, variation, between, languages, was, investigated, in, the, port, royal, grammar, of, arnauld, and, lancelot, among, others, who, described, it, as, accidental, and, separate, from, the, logical, requirements, of, thought, and, language, the, classical, view, was, overturned, in, the, early, 19th, century, by, the, advocates, of, german, romanticism, humboldt, and, his, contemporaries, questioned, the, existence, of, a, universal, inner, form, of, thought, they, argued, that, since, thinking, is, verbal, language, must, be, the, prerequisite, for, thought, therefore, every, nation, has, its, own, unique, way, of, thinking, a, worldview, which, has, evolved, with, the, linguistic, history, of, the, nation, diversity, became, emphasized, with, a, focus, on, the, uncontrollable, sociohistorical, construction, of, language, influential, romantic, accounts, include, grimm, s, sound, laws, of, linguistic, evolution, schleicher, s, darwinian, species, language, analogy, the, v, lkerpsychologie, accounts, of, language, by, steinthal, and, wundt, and, saussure, s, semiology, a, dyadic, model, of, semiotics, i, e, language, as, a, sign, system, with, its, own, inner, logic, separated, from, physical, reality, in, the, early, 20th, century, logical, grammar, was, defended, by, frege, and, husserl, husserl, s, pure, logical, grammar, draws, from, 17th, century, rational, universal, grammar, proposing, a, formal, semantics, that, links, the, structures, of, physical, reality, e, g, this, paper, is, white, with, the, structures, of, the, mind, meaning, and, the, surface, form, of, natural, languages, husserl, s, treatise, was, however, rejected, in, general, linguistics, instead, linguists, opted, for, chomsky, s, theory, of, universal, grammar, as, an, innate, biological, structure, that, generates, syntax, in, a, formalistic, fashion, i, e, irrespective, of, meaning, many, philosophers, continue, to, hold, the, view, that, language, is, a, logically, based, tool, of, expressing, the, structures, of, reality, by, means, of, predicate, argument, structure, proponents, include, with, different, nuances, russell, wittgenstein, sellars, davidson, putnam, and, searle, attempts, to, revive, logical, formal, semantics, as, a, basis, of, linguistics, followed, e, g, the, montague, grammar, despite, resistance, from, linguists, including, chomsky, and, lakoff, formal, semantics, was, established, in, the, late, twentieth, century, however, its, influence, has, been, mostly, limited, to, computational, linguistics, with, little, impact, on, general, linguistics, the, incompatibility, with, genetics, and, neuropsychology, of, chomsky, s, innate, grammar, gave, rise, to, new, psychologically, and, biologically, oriented, theories, of, language, in, the, 1980s, and, these, have, gained, influence, in, linguistics, and, cognitive, science, in, the, 21st, century, examples, include, lakoff, s, conceptual, metaphor, which, argues, that, language, arises, automatically, from, visual, and, other, sensory, input, and, different, models, inspired, by, dawkins, s, memetics, a, neo, darwinian, model, of, linguistic, units, as, the, units, of, natural, selection, these, include, cognitive, grammar, construction, grammar, and, usage, based, linguistics, one, debate, that, has, captured, the, interest, of, many, philosophers, is, the, debate, over, the, meaning, of, universals, it, might, be, asked, for, example, why, when, people, say, the, word, rocks, what, it, is, that, the, word, represents, two, different, answers, have, emerged, to, this, question, some, have, said, that, the, expression, stands, for, some, real, abstract, universal, out, in, the, world, called, rocks, others, have, said, that, the, word, stands, for, some, collection, of, particular, individual, rocks, that, are, associated, with, merely, a, nomenclature, the, former, position, has, been, called, philosophical, realism, and, the, latter, nominalism, the, issue, here, can, be, explicated, in, examination, of, the, proposition, socrates, is, a, man, from, the, realist, s, perspective, the, connection, between, s, and, m, is, a, connection, between, two, abstract, entities, there, is, an, entity, man, and, an, entity, socrates, these, two, things, connect, in, some, way, or, overlap, from, a, nominalist, s, perspective, the, connection, between, s, and, m, is, the, connection, between, a, particular, entity, socrates, and, a, vast, collection, of, particular, things, men, to, say, that, socrates, is, a, man, is, to, say, that, socrates, is, a, part, of, the, class, of, men, another, perspective, is, to, consider, man, to, be, a, property, of, the, entity, socrates, there, is, a, third, way, between, nominalism, and, extreme, realism, usually, called, moderate, realism, and, attributed, to, aristotle, and, thomas, aquinas, moderate, realists, hold, that, man, refers, to, a, real, essence, or, form, that, is, really, present, and, identical, in, socrates, and, all, other, men, but, man, does, not, exist, as, a, separate, and, distinct, entity, this, is, a, realist, position, because, man, is, real, insofar, as, it, really, exists, in, all, men, but, it, is, a, moderate, realism, because, man, is, not, an, entity, separate, from, the, men, it, informs, another, of, the, questions, that, has, divided, philosophers, of, language, is, the, extent, to, which, formal, logic, can, be, used, as, an, effective, tool, in, the, analysis, and, understanding, of, natural, languages, while, most, philosophers, including, gottlob, frege, alfred, tarski, and, rudolf, carnap, have, been, more, or, less, skeptical, about, formalizing, natural, languages, many, of, them, developed, formal, languages, for, use, in, the, sciences, or, formalized, parts, of, natural, language, for, investigation, some, of, the, most, prominent, members, of, this, tradition, of, formal, semantics, include, tarski, carnap, richard, montague, and, donald, davidson, on, the, other, side, of, the, divide, and, especially, prominent, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, were, the, so, called, ordinary, language, philosophers, philosophers, such, as, p, f, strawson, john, langshaw, austin, and, gilbert, ryle, stressed, the, importance, of, studying, natural, language, without, regard, to, the, truth, conditions, of, sentences, and, the, references, of, terms, they, did, not, believe, that, the, social, and, practical, dimensions, of, linguistic, meaning, could, be, captured, by, any, attempts, at, formalization, using, the, tools, of, logic, logic, is, one, thing, and, language, is, something, entirely, different, what, is, important, is, not, expressions, themselves, but, what, people, use, them, to, do, in, communication, hence, austin, developed, a, theory, of, speech, acts, which, described, the, kinds, of, things, which, can, be, done, with, a, sentence, assertion, command, inquiry, exclamation, in, different, contexts, of, use, on, different, occasions, strawson, argued, that, the, truth, table, semantics, of, the, logical, connectives, e, g, displaystyle, land, displaystyle, lor, and, displaystyle, rightarrow, do, not, capture, the, meanings, of, their, natural, language, counterparts, and, or, and, if, then, while, the, ordinary, language, movement, basically, died, out, in, the, 1970s, its, influence, was, crucial, to, the, development, of, the, fields, of, speech, act, theory, and, the, study, of, pragmatics, many, of, its, ideas, have, been, absorbed, by, theorists, such, as, kent, bach, robert, brandom, paul, horwich, and, stephen, neale, in, recent, work, the, division, between, semantics, and, pragmatics, has, become, a, lively, topic, of, discussion, at, the, interface, of, philosophy, and, linguistics, for, instance, in, work, by, sperber, and, wilson, carston, and, levinson, while, keeping, these, traditions, in, mind, the, question, of, whether, or, not, there, is, any, grounds, for, conflict, between, the, formal, and, informal, approaches, is, far, from, being, decided, some, theorists, like, paul, grice, have, been, skeptical, of, any, claims, that, there, is, a, substantial, conflict, between, logic, and, natural, language, game, theory, has, been, suggested, as, a, tool, to, study, the, evolution, of, language, some, researchers, that, have, developed, game, theoretical, approaches, to, philosophy, of, language, are, david, k, lewis, schuhmacher, and, rubinstein, translation, and, interpretation, are, two, other, problems, that, philosophers, of, language, have, attempted, to, confront, in, the, 1950s, w, v, quine, argued, for, the, indeterminacy, of, meaning, and, reference, based, on, the, principle, of, radical, translation, in, word, and, object, quine, asks, readers, to, imagine, a, situation, in, which, they, are, confronted, with, a, previously, undocumented, group, of, indigenous, people, where, they, must, attempt, to, make, sense, of, the, utterances, and, gestures, that, its, members, make, this, is, the, situation, of, radical, translation, he, claimed, that, in, such, a, situation, it, is, impossible, in, principle, to, be, absolutely, certain, of, the, meaning, or, reference, that, a, speaker, of, the, indigenous, peoples, language, attaches, to, an, utterance, for, example, if, a, speaker, sees, a, rabbit, and, says, gavagai, is, she, referring, to, the, whole, rabbit, to, the, rabbit, s, tail, or, to, a, temporal, part, of, the, rabbit, all, that, can, be, done, is, to, examine, the, utterance, as, a, part, of, the, overall, linguistic, behaviour, of, the, individual, and, then, use, these, observations, to, interpret, the, meaning, of, all, other, utterances, from, this, basis, one, can, form, a, manual, of, translation, but, since, reference, is, indeterminate, there, will, be, many, such, manuals, no, one, of, which, is, more, correct, than, the, others, for, quine, as, for, wittgenstein, and, austin, meaning, is, not, something, that, is, associated, with, a, single, word, or, sentence, but, is, rather, something, that, if, it, can, be, attributed, at, all, can, only, be, attributed, to, a, whole, language, the, resulting, view, is, called, semantic, holism, inspired, by, quine, s, discussion, donald, davidson, extended, the, idea, of, radical, translation, to, the, interpretation, of, utterances, and, behavior, within, a, single, linguistic, community, he, dubbed, this, notion, radical, interpretation, he, suggested, that, the, meaning, that, any, individual, ascribed, to, a, sentence, could, only, be, determined, by, attributing, meanings, to, many, perhaps, all, of, the, individual, s, assertions, as, well, as, their, mental, states, and, attitudes, one, issue, that, has, troubled, philosophers, of, language, and, logic, is, the, problem, of, the, vagueness, of, words, the, specific, instances, of, vagueness, that, most, interest, philosophers, of, language, are, those, where, the, existence, of, borderline, cases, makes, it, seemingly, impossible, to, say, whether, a, predicate, is, true, or, false, classic, examples, are, is, tall, or, is, bald, where, it, cannot, be, said, that, some, borderline, case, some, given, person, is, tall, or, not, tall, in, consequence, vagueness, gives, rise, to, the, paradox, of, the, heap, many, theorists, have, attempted, to, solve, the, paradox, by, way, of, n, valued, logics, such, as, fuzzy, logic, which, have, radically, departed, from, classical, two, valued, logics
