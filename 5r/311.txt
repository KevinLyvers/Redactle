religion, in, ancient, rome, consisted, of, varying, imperial, and, provincial, religious, practices, which, were, followed, both, by, the, people, of, rome, as, well, as, those, who, were, brought, under, its, rule, the, romans, thought, of, themselves, as, highly, religious, and, attributed, their, success, as, a, world, power, to, their, collective, piety, pietas, in, maintaining, good, relations, with, the, gods, their, polytheistic, religion, is, known, for, having, honored, many, deities, the, presence, of, greeks, on, the, italian, peninsula, from, the, beginning, of, the, historical, period, influenced, roman, culture, introducing, some, religious, practices, that, became, fundamental, such, as, the, cultus, of, apollo, the, romans, looked, for, common, ground, between, their, major, gods, and, those, of, the, greeks, interpretatio, graeca, adapting, greek, myths, and, iconography, for, latin, literature, and, roman, art, as, the, etruscans, had, etruscan, religion, was, also, a, major, influence, particularly, on, the, practice, of, augury, used, by, the, state, to, seek, the, will, of, the, gods, according, to, legends, most, of, rome, s, religious, institutions, could, be, traced, to, its, founders, particularly, numa, pompilius, the, sabine, second, king, of, rome, who, negotiated, directly, with, the, gods, this, archaic, religion, was, the, foundation, of, the, mos, maiorum, the, way, of, the, ancestors, or, simply, tradition, viewed, as, central, to, roman, identity, roman, religion, was, practical, and, contractual, based, on, the, principle, of, do, ut, des, i, give, that, you, might, give, religion, depended, on, knowledge, and, the, correct, practice, of, prayer, rite, and, sacrifice, not, on, faith, or, dogma, although, latin, literature, preserves, learned, speculation, on, the, nature, of, the, divine, and, its, relation, to, human, affairs, even, the, most, skeptical, among, rome, s, intellectual, elite, such, as, cicero, who, was, an, augur, saw, religion, as, a, source, of, social, order, as, the, roman, empire, expanded, migrants, to, the, capital, brought, their, local, cults, many, of, which, became, popular, among, italians, christianity, was, eventually, the, most, successful, of, these, beliefs, and, in, 380, became, the, official, state, religion, for, ordinary, romans, religion, was, a, part, of, daily, life, each, home, had, a, household, shrine, at, which, prayers, and, libations, to, the, family, s, domestic, deities, were, offered, neighborhood, shrines, and, sacred, places, such, as, springs, and, groves, dotted, the, city, the, roman, calendar, was, structured, around, religious, observances, women, slaves, and, children, all, participated, in, a, range, of, religious, activities, some, public, rituals, could, be, conducted, only, by, women, and, women, formed, what, is, perhaps, rome, s, most, famous, priesthood, the, state, supported, vestals, who, tended, rome, s, sacred, hearth, for, centuries, until, disbanded, under, christian, domination, the, priesthoods, of, most, state, religions, were, held, by, members, of, the, elite, classes, there, was, no, principle, analogous, to, separation, of, church, and, state, in, ancient, rome, during, the, roman, republic, 509, 27, bc, the, same, men, who, were, elected, public, officials, might, also, serve, as, augurs, and, pontiffs, priests, married, raised, families, and, led, politically, active, lives, julius, caesar, became, pontifex, maximus, before, he, was, elected, consul, the, augurs, read, the, will, of, the, gods, and, supervised, the, marking, of, boundaries, as, a, reflection, of, universal, order, thus, sanctioning, roman, expansionism, and, foreign, wars, as, a, matter, of, divine, destiny, the, roman, triumph, was, at, its, core, a, religious, procession, in, which, the, victorious, general, displayed, his, piety, and, his, willingness, to, serve, the, public, good, by, dedicating, a, portion, of, his, spoils, to, the, gods, especially, jupiter, who, embodied, just, rule, as, a, result, of, the, punic, wars, 264, 146, bc, when, rome, struggled, to, establish, itself, as, a, dominant, power, many, new, temples, were, built, by, magistrates, in, fulfillment, of, a, vow, to, a, deity, for, assuring, their, military, success, as, the, romans, extended, their, dominance, throughout, the, mediterranean, world, their, policy, in, general, was, to, absorb, the, deities, and, cults, of, other, peoples, rather, than, try, to, eradicate, them, since, they, believed, that, preserving, tradition, promoted, social, stability, one, way, that, rome, incorporated, diverse, peoples, was, by, supporting, their, religious, heritage, building, temples, to, local, deities, that, framed, their, theology, within, the, hierarchy, of, roman, religion, inscriptions, throughout, the, empire, record, the, side, by, side, worship, of, local, and, roman, deities, including, dedications, made, by, romans, to, local, gods, by, the, height, of, the, empire, numerous, international, deities, were, cultivated, at, rome, and, had, been, carried, to, even, the, most, remote, provinces, among, them, cybele, isis, epona, and, gods, of, solar, monism, such, as, mithras, and, sol, invictus, found, as, far, north, as, roman, britain, foreign, religions, increasingly, attracted, devotees, among, romans, who, increasingly, had, ancestry, from, elsewhere, in, the, empire, imported, mystery, religions, which, offered, initiates, salvation, in, the, afterlife, were, a, matter, of, personal, choice, for, an, individual, practiced, in, addition, to, carrying, on, one, s, family, rites, and, participating, in, public, religion, the, mysteries, however, involved, exclusive, oaths, and, secrecy, conditions, that, conservative, romans, viewed, with, suspicion, as, characteristic, of, magic, conspiratorial, coniuratio, or, subversive, activity, sporadic, and, sometimes, brutal, attempts, were, made, to, suppress, religionists, who, seemed, to, threaten, traditional, morality, and, unity, as, with, the, senate, s, efforts, to, restrict, the, bacchanals, in, 186, bc, because, romans, had, never, been, obligated, to, cultivate, one, god, or, one, cult, only, religious, tolerance, was, not, an, issue, in, the, sense, that, it, is, for, monotheistic, systems, the, monotheistic, rigor, of, judaism, posed, difficulties, for, roman, policy, that, led, at, times, to, compromise, and, the, granting, of, special, exemptions, but, sometimes, to, intractable, conflict, for, example, religious, disputes, helped, cause, the, first, jewish, roman, war, and, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, in, the, wake, of, the, republic, s, collapse, state, religion, had, adapted, to, support, the, new, regime, of, the, emperors, augustus, the, first, roman, emperor, justified, the, novelty, of, one, man, rule, with, a, vast, program, of, religious, revivalism, and, reform, public, vows, formerly, made, for, the, security, of, the, republic, now, were, directed, at, the, well, being, of, the, emperor, so, called, emperor, worship, expanded, on, a, grand, scale, the, traditional, roman, veneration, of, the, ancestral, dead, and, of, the, genius, the, divine, tutelary, of, every, individual, the, imperial, cult, became, one, of, the, major, ways, in, which, rome, advertised, its, presence, in, the, provinces, and, cultivated, shared, cultural, identity, and, loyalty, throughout, the, empire, rejection, of, the, state, religion, was, tantamount, to, treason, this, was, the, context, for, rome, s, conflict, with, christianity, which, romans, variously, regarded, as, a, form, of, atheism, and, novel, superstitio, while, christians, considered, roman, religion, to, be, paganism, ultimately, roman, polytheism, was, brought, to, an, end, with, the, adoption, of, christianity, as, the, official, religion, of, the, empire, the, roman, mythological, tradition, is, particularly, rich, in, historical, myths, or, legends, concerning, the, foundation, and, rise, of, the, city, these, narratives, focus, on, human, actors, with, only, occasional, intervention, from, deities, but, a, pervasive, sense, of, divinely, ordered, destiny, for, rome, s, earliest, period, history, and, myth, are, difficult, to, distinguish, according, to, mythology, rome, had, a, semi, divine, ancestor, in, the, trojan, refugee, aeneas, son, of, venus, who, was, said, to, have, established, the, basis, of, roman, religion, when, he, brought, the, palladium, lares, and, penates, from, troy, to, italy, these, objects, were, believed, in, historical, times, to, remain, in, the, keeping, of, the, vestals, rome, s, female, priesthood, aeneas, according, to, classical, authors, had, been, given, refuge, by, king, evander, a, greek, exile, from, arcadia, to, whom, were, attributed, other, religious, foundations, he, established, the, ara, maxima, greatest, altar, to, hercules, at, the, site, that, would, become, the, forum, boarium, and, so, the, legend, went, he, was, the, first, to, celebrate, the, lupercalia, an, archaic, festival, in, february, that, was, celebrated, as, late, as, the, 5th, century, of, the, christian, era, the, myth, of, a, trojan, founding, with, greek, influence, was, reconciled, through, an, elaborate, genealogy, the, latin, kings, of, alba, longa, with, the, well, known, legend, of, rome, s, founding, by, romulus, and, remus, the, most, common, version, of, the, twins, story, displays, several, aspects, of, hero, myth, their, mother, rhea, silvia, had, been, ordered, by, her, uncle, the, king, to, remain, a, virgin, in, order, to, preserve, the, throne, he, had, usurped, from, her, father, through, divine, intervention, the, rightful, line, was, restored, when, rhea, silvia, was, impregnated, by, the, god, mars, she, gave, birth, to, twins, who, were, duly, exposed, by, order, of, the, king, but, saved, through, a, series, of, miraculous, events, romulus, and, remus, regained, their, grandfather, s, throne, and, set, out, to, build, a, new, city, consulting, with, the, gods, through, augury, a, characteristic, religious, institution, of, rome, that, is, portrayed, as, existing, from, earliest, times, the, brothers, quarrel, while, building, the, city, walls, and, romulus, kills, remus, an, act, that, is, sometimes, seen, as, sacrificial, fratricide, thus, became, an, integral, part, of, rome, s, founding, myth, romulus, was, credited, with, several, religious, institutions, he, founded, the, consualia, festival, inviting, the, neighbouring, sabines, to, participate, the, ensuing, rape, of, the, sabine, women, by, romulus, s, men, further, embedded, both, violence, and, cultural, assimilation, in, rome, s, myth, of, origins, as, a, successful, general, romulus, is, also, supposed, to, have, founded, rome, s, first, temple, to, jupiter, feretrius, and, offered, the, spolia, opima, the, prime, spoils, taken, in, war, in, the, celebration, of, the, first, roman, triumph, spared, a, mortal, s, death, romulus, was, mysteriously, spirited, away, and, deified, his, sabine, successor, numa, was, pious, and, peaceable, and, credited, with, numerous, political, and, religious, foundations, including, the, first, roman, calendar, the, priesthoods, of, the, salii, flamines, and, vestals, the, cults, of, jupiter, mars, and, quirinus, and, the, temple, of, janus, whose, doors, stayed, open, in, times, of, war, but, in, numa, s, time, remained, closed, after, numa, s, death, the, doors, to, the, temple, of, janus, were, supposed, to, have, remained, open, until, the, reign, of, augustus, each, of, rome, s, legendary, or, semi, legendary, kings, was, associated, with, one, or, more, religious, institutions, still, known, to, the, later, republic, tullus, hostilius, and, ancus, marcius, instituted, the, fetial, priests, the, first, outsider, etruscan, king, lucius, tarquinius, priscus, founded, a, capitoline, temple, to, the, triad, jupiter, juno, and, minerva, which, served, as, the, model, for, the, highest, official, cult, throughout, the, roman, world, the, benevolent, divinely, fathered, servius, tullius, established, the, latin, league, its, aventine, temple, to, diana, and, the, compitalia, to, mark, his, social, reforms, servius, tullius, was, murdered, and, succeeded, by, the, arrogant, tarquinius, superbus, whose, expulsion, marked, the, end, of, roman, kingship, and, the, beginning, of, the, roman, republic, governed, by, elected, magistrates, roman, historians, regarded, the, essentials, of, republican, religion, as, complete, by, the, end, of, numa, s, reign, and, confirmed, as, right, and, lawful, by, the, senate, and, people, of, rome, the, sacred, topography, of, the, city, its, monuments, and, temples, the, histories, of, rome, s, leading, families, and, oral, and, ritual, traditions, according, to, cicero, the, romans, considered, themselves, the, most, religious, of, all, peoples, and, their, rise, to, dominance, was, proof, they, received, divine, favor, in, return, rome, offers, no, native, creation, myth, and, little, mythography, to, explain, the, character, of, its, deities, their, mutual, relationships, or, their, interactions, with, the, human, world, but, roman, theology, acknowledged, that, di, immortales, immortal, gods, ruled, all, realms, of, the, heavens, and, earth, there, were, gods, of, the, upper, heavens, gods, of, the, underworld, and, a, myriad, of, lesser, deities, between, some, evidently, favoured, rome, because, rome, honoured, them, but, none, were, intrinsically, irredeemably, foreign, or, alien, the, political, cultural, and, religious, coherence, of, an, emergent, roman, super, state, required, a, broad, inclusive, and, flexible, network, of, lawful, cults, at, different, times, and, in, different, places, the, sphere, of, influence, character, and, functions, of, a, divine, being, could, expand, overlap, with, those, of, others, and, be, redefined, as, roman, change, was, embedded, within, existing, traditions, several, versions, of, a, semi, official, structured, pantheon, were, developed, during, the, political, social, and, religious, instability, of, the, late, republican, era, jupiter, the, most, powerful, of, all, gods,

organization, and, external, relations, during, the, archaic, and, early, republican, eras, he, shared, his, temple, some, aspects, of, cult, and, several, divine, characteristics, with, mars, and, quirinus, who, were, later, replaced, by, juno, and, minerva, a, conceptual, tendency, toward, triads, may, be, indicated, by, the, later, agricultural, or, plebeian, triad, of, ceres, liber, and, libera, and, by, some, of, the, complementary, threefold, deity, groupings, of, imperial, cult, other, major, and, minor, deities, could, be, single, coupled, or, linked, retrospectively, through,

sense, that, the, two, cultures, had, a, shared, heritage, the, impressive, costly, and, centralised, rites, to, the, deities, of, the, roman, state, were, vastly, outnumbered, in, everyday, life, by, commonplace, religious, observances, pertaining, to, an, individual, s, domestic, and, personal, deities, the, patron, divinities, of, rome, s, various, neighborhoods, and, communities, and, the,

non, sacred, days, dies, nefasti, a, comparison, of, surviving, roman, religious, calendars, suggests, that, official, festivals, were, organized, according, to, broad, seasonal, groups, that, allowed, for, different, local, traditions, some, of, the, most, ancient, and, popular, festivals, incorporated, ludi, games, such, as, chariot, races, and, theatrical, performances, with, examples, including, those, held, at, palestrina, in, honour, of, fortuna, primigenia, during, compitalia, and, the, ludi, romani, in, honour, of, liber, other, festivals, may, have, required, only, the, presence, and, rites, of, their, priests, and, acolytes, or, particular, groups, such, as, women, at, the, bona, dea, rites, other, public, festivals, were, not, required, by, the, calendar, but, occasioned, by, events, the, triumph, of, a, roman, general, was, celebrated, as, the, fulfillment, of, religious, vows, though, these, tended, to, be, overshadowed, by, the, political, and, social, significance, of, the, event, during, the, late, republic, the, political, elite, competed, to, outdo, each, other, in, public, display, and, the, ludi, attendant, on, a, triumph, were, expanded, to, include, gladiator, contests, under, the, principate, all, such, spectacular, displays, came, under, imperial, control, the, most, lavish, were, subsidised, by, emperors, and, lesser, events, were, provided, by, magistrates, as, a, sacred, duty, and, privilege, of, office, additional, festivals, and, games, celebrated, imperial, accessions, and, anniversaries, others, such, as, the, traditional, republican, secular, games, to, mark, a, new, era, saeculum, became, imperially, funded, to, maintain, traditional, values, and, a, common, roman, identity, that, the, spectacles, retained, something, of, their, sacral, aura, even, in, late, antiquity, is, indicated, by, the, admonitions, of, the, church, fathers, that, christians, should, not, take, part, the, meaning, and, origin, of, many, archaic, festivals, baffled, even, rome, s, intellectual, elite, but, the, more, obscure, they, were, the, greater, the, opportunity, for, reinvention, and, reinterpretation, a, fact, lost, neither,

covering, roman, holidays, from, january, to, june, ovid, presents, a, unique, look, at, roman, antiquarian, lore, popular, customs, and, religious, practice, that, is, by, turns, imaginative, entertaining, high, minded, and, scurrilous, not, a, priestly, account, despite, the, speaker, s, pose, as, a, vates, or, inspired, poet, prophet, but, a, work, of, description, imagination, and, poetic, etymology, that, reflects, the, broad, humor, and, burlesque, spirit, of, such, venerable, festivals, as, the, saturnalia, consualia, and, feast, of, anna, perenna, on, the, ides, of, march, where, ovid, treats, the, assassination, of, the, newly, deified, julius, caesar, as, utterly, incidental, to, the, festivities, among, the, roman, people, but, official, calendars, preserved, from, different, times, and, places, also, show, a, flexibility, in, omitting, or, expanding, events, indicating, that, there, was, no, single, static, and, authoritative, calendar, of, required, observances, in, the, later, empire, under, christian, rule, the, new, christian, festivals, were, incorporated, into, the, existing, framework, of, the, roman, calendar, alongside, at, least, some,

chiefly, of, animals, would, take, place, at, an, open, air, altar, within, the, templum, or, precinct, often, to, the, side, of, the, steps, leading, up, to, the, raised, portico, the, main, room,

referred, not, to, the, temple, building, itself, but, to, a, sacred, space, surveyed, and, plotted, ritually, through, augury, the, architecture, of, the, ancient, romans, was, from, first, to, last, an, art, of, shaping, space, around, ritual, the, roman, architect, vitruvius, always, uses, the, word, templum, to, refer, to, this, sacred, precinct, and, the, more, common, latin, words, aedes,

effective, pliny, the, elder, declared, that, a, sacrifice, without, prayer, is, thought, to, be, useless, and, not, a, proper, consultation, of, the, gods, prayer, by, itself, however, had, independent, power, the, spoken, word, was, thus, the, single, most, potent, religious, action, and, knowledge, of, the, correct, verbal, formulas, the, key, to, efficacy, accurate, naming, was,
