probably, ibn, taymiyyah, who, used, the, short, term, for, the, first, time, it, was, later, popularized, by, pan, islamic, scholars, such, as, muhammad, rashid, rida, in, his, treatise, as, sunna,

with, shias, the, word, pair, sunnah, shia, is, also, used, on, western, research, literature, to, denote, the, sunni, shia, contrast, one, of, the, earliest, supporting, documents, for, ahl, as, sunna, derives, from, the, basric, scholar, muhammad, ibn, siri, d, 728, his, is, mentioned, in, the, sahih, of, muslim, ibn, al, hajjaj, quoted, with, formerly, one, did, not, ask, about, the, isnad, but, when, the, fitna, started, one, said, name, us, your, informants, one, would, then, respond, to, them, if, they, were, sunnah, people, you, accept, their, hadith, but, if, they, are, people, of,

ahl, as, sunna, was, always, a, laudatory, designation, abu, hanifa, d, 769, who, sympathized, with, murdshia, insisted, that, this, were, righteous, people, and, people, of, the, sunnah, ahl, al, adl, wa, ahl, as, sunna, according, to, josef, van, ess, this, term, did, not, mean, more, than, honorable, and, righteous, believing, people, among, hanafits, the, designation, ahl, as, sunna, and, ahl, al, adl, people, of, the, righteous, remained, interchangeable, for, a, long, time, thus, the, hanafite, ab, l, q, sim, as, samarqand, d, 953, who, composed, a, catechism, for, the, samanides, used, sometimes, one, expression, and, sometimes, another, for, his, own, group, singular, to, ahl, as, sunna, was, ib, sunna, adherent, to, the, sunnah, this, expression, was, used, for, example, by, abd, all, h, ibn, al, mub, rak, d, 797, for, a, person, who, distances, himself, from, the, teachings, of, shia, kharijites, qadarites, and, murjites, in, addition, the, nisba, adjective, sunn, was, also, used, for, the, individual, person, thus, it, has, been, recorded, the, kufic, scholar, of, the, quran, ab, bakr, ibn, ayy, sh, d, 809, was, asked, how, he, was, a, sunni, he, responded, the, following, the, one, who, when, the, heresies, are, mentioned, doesn, t, get, excited, about, any, of, them, the, andalusiaian, scholar, ibn, hazm, d, 1064, taught, later, that, whose, who, confess, to, islam, can, be, divided, into, four, groups, ahl, as, sunna, mutazilites, murjites, shites, kharijites, the, mu, tazilites, replaced, the, qadarites, here, in, the, 9th, century, one, started, to, extent, the, term, ahl, as, sunna, with, further, positive, additions, abu, al, hasan, al, ashari, used, for, his, own, group, expressions, like, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, istiq, ma, people, of, sunna, and, straightness, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, ad, people, of, sunnah, and, of, the, hadith, or, ahl, al, aqq, wa, s, sunna, people, of, truth, and, of, the, sunnah, when, the, expression, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jama, ah, appeared, for, the, first, time, is, not, entirely, clear, the, abbasite, caliph, al, ma, m, n, reigned, 813, 33, criticized, in, his, mihna, edict, a, group, of, people, who, related, themselves, to, the, sunnah, nasab, anfusa, hum, il, s, sunna, and, claimed, they, are, the, people, of, truth, religion, and, community, ahl, al, aqq, wa, d, d, n, wa, l, jam, ah, sunna, and, jam, ah, are, already, connected, here, as, a, pair, these, terms, already, appear, in, the, 9th, century, it, is, recorded, that, the, disciple, of, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, harb, ibn, ismail, as, sirjdshani, d, 893, created, a, writing, with, the, title, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, to, which, the, mutazilite, abu, al, qasim, al, balchi, wrote, a, refutation, later, al, jubba, i, d, 916, tells, in, his, kit, b, al, maq, l, t, that, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, attributed, to, his, students, the, predicate, sunn, jam, ah, jammatic, sunnite, this, indicates, that, the, hanbalis, were, the, first, to, use, the, phrase, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, as, a, self, designation, the, karramiyya, founded, by, muhammad, ibn, karram, d, 859, referred, to, the, sunnah, and, community, they, passed, down, in, praise, of, their, school, founder, a, hadith, according, to, which, muhammad, predicted, that, at, the, end, of, times, a, man, named, muhammad, ibn, karram, will, appear, who, will, restore, the, sunna, and, the, community, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, and, take, hidraj, from, chorasan, to, jerusalem, just, how, muhammad, himself, took, a, hidraj, from, mecca, to, medina, according, to, the, testimony, of, the, transoxanian, scholar, abu, al, yusr, al, bazdawi, d, 1099, the, kullabites, followers, of, the, basrian, scholar, ibn, kullab, d, 855, dayed, about, themselves, that, they, are, among, the, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jama, too, abu, al, hasan, al, ashari, used, the, expression, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, rarely, and, preferred, another, combination, later, asharites, like, al, isfaranini, d, 1027, nad, abd, al, qahir, al, baghdadi, d, 1078, used, the, expression, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, too, and, used, them, in, their, works, to, designate, the, teachings, of, their, own, school, according, to, al, bazdawi, all, asharites, in, his, time, said, they, belong, to, the, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, during, this, time, the, term, has, been, used, as, a, self, designation, by, the, hanafite, maturidites, in, transoxiania, used, frequently, by, abu, al, layth, al, samarqandi, d, 983, abu, schakur, as, salimi, d, 1086, and, al, bazdawi, himself, they, used, the, term, as, a, contrast, from, their, enemies, among, them, hanafites, in, the, west, who, have, been, followers, of, the, mutazilites, al, bazdaw, also, contrasted, the, ahl, as, sunnah, wa, l, jam, ah, with, ahl, al, ad, th, because, they, would, adhere, to, teachings, contrary, to, the, quran, according, to, schams, ad, d, n, al, maqdis, end, of, the, 10th, century, was, the, expression, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, a, laudatory, term, during, his, time, similar, to, ahl, al, adl, wa, t, taw, d, people, of, righteousness, and, divine, unity, which, was, used, for, mutazilites, or, generally, designations, like, mu, min, n, believer, or, a, b, al, hud, people, of, guidance, for, muslims, who, has, been, seen, as, rightoues, believers, since, the, expression, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, ah, was, used, with, a, demand, on, rightoues, belief, it, was, used, in, academic, researches, translated, as, orthodox, there, are, different, opinions, regarding, what, the, term, jama, in, the, phrase, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jama, actually, means, among, muslim, scholars, in, the, sunni, creed, by, at, tahawi, d, 933, the, term, jama, contrasts, several, times, the, arabic, term, furqa, division, sectarianism, thus, at, tah, w, explains, that, jama, is, considered, as, true, or, right, aqq, wa, aw, b, and, furqa, as, aberration, and, punishment, zai, wa, a, b, ibn, taymiyyah, argues, that, jama, as, opposite, term, to, furqa, inherents, the, meaning, of, i, tim, coming, together, being, together, agreement, furthermore, he, connects, it, with, the, principle, of, ijma, a, third, juridical, source, after, the, book, quran, and, the, sunnah, the, ottoman, scholar, muslih, ad, din, al, qastallani, d, 1495, held, the, opinnion, that, jama, means, path, of, the, sahaba, ar, qat, a, a, ba, the, modern, indonesian, theologican, nurcholish, madjid, d, 2005, interpreted, jama, as, an, inclusivistic, concept, it, means, a, society, open, for, pluralism, and, dialogue, but, does, not, emphasize, that, much, one, common, mistake, is, to, assume, that, sunni, islam, represents, a, normative, islam, that, emerged, during, the, period, after, muhammad, s, death, and, that, sufism, and, shi, ism, developed, out, of, sunni, islam, this, perception, is, partly, due, to, the, reliance, on, highly, ideological, sources, that, have, been, accepted, as, reliable, historical, works, and, also, because, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, is, sunni, both, sunnism, and, shiaism, are, the, end, products, of, several, centuries, of, competition, between, ideologies, both, sects, used, each, other, to, further, cement, their, own, identities, and, doctrines, the, first, four, caliphs, are, known, among, sunnis, as, the, r, shidun, or, rightly, guided, ones, sunni, recognition, includes, the, aforementioned, abu, bakr, as, the, first, umar, as, the, second, uthman, as, the, third, and, ali, as, the, fourth, sunnis, recognised, different, rulers, as, the, caliph, though, they, did, not, include, anyone, in, the, list, of, the, rightly, guided, ones, or, r, shidun, after, the, murder, of, ali, until, the, caliphate, was, constitutionally, abolished, in, turkey, on, 3, march, 1924, the, seeds, of, metamorphosis, of, caliphate, into, kingship, were, sown, as, the, second, caliph, umar, had, feared, as, early, as, the, regime, of, the, third, caliph, uthman, who, appointed, many, of, his, kinsmen, from, his, clan, banu, umayya, including, marw, n, and, walid, bin, uqba, on, important, government, positions, becoming, the, main, cause, of, turmoil, resulting, in, his, murder, and, the, ensuing, infighting, during, ali, s, time, and, rebellion, by, mu, wiya, another, of, uthman, s, kinsman, this, ultimately, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, firm, dynastic, rule, of, banu, umayya, after, husain, the, younger, son, of, ali, from, f, tima, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, karbal, the, rise, to, power, of, banu, umayya, the, meccan, tribe, of, elites, who, had, vehemently, opposed, muhammad, under, the, leadership, of, abu, sufy, n, mu, wiya, s, father, right, up, to, the, conquest, of, mecca, by, muhammad, as, his, successors, with, the, accession, of, uthman, to, caliphate, replaced, the, egalitarian, society, formed, as, a, result, of, muhammad, s, revolution, to, a, society, stratified, between, haves, and, have, nots, as, a, result, of, nepotism, and, in, the, words, of, el, hibri, through, the, use, of, religious, charity, revenues, zak, t, to, subsidise, family, interests, which, uthman, justified, as, al, sila, pious, filial, support, ali, during, his, rather, brief, regime, after, uthman, maintained, austere, life, style, and, tried, hard, to, bring, back, the, egalitarian, system, and, supremacy, of, law, over, the, ruler, idealised, in, muhammad, s, message, but, faced, continued, opposition, and, wars, one, after, another, by, aisha, talhah, zubair, by, mu, wiya, and, finally, by, the, kh, rjites, after, he, was, murdered, his, followers, immediately, elected, hasan, ibn, ali, his, elder, son, from, f, tima, to, succeed, him, hasan, shortly, afterward, signed, a, treaty, with, mu, wiya, relinquishing, power, in, favour, of, the, latter, with, a, condition, inter, alia, that, one, of, the, two, who, will, outlive, the, other, will, be, the, caliph, and, that, this, caliph, will, not, appoint, a, successor, but, will, leave, the, matter, of, selection, of, the, caliph, to, the, public, subsequently, hasan, was, poisoned, to, death, and, muawiya, enjoyed, unchallenged, power, dishonouring, his, treaty, with, hasan, he, nominated, his, son, yazid, to, succeed, him, upon, mu, wiya, s, death, yazid, asked, husain, the, younger, brother, of, hasan, ali, s, son, and, muhammad, s, grandson, to, give, his, allegiance, to, yazid, which, he, plainly, refused, his, caravan, was, cordoned, by, yazid, s, army, at, karbal, and, he, was, killed, with, all, his, male, companions, total, 72, people, in, a, day, long, battle, after, which, yazid, established, himself, as, a, sovereign, though, strong, public, uprising, erupted, after, his, death, against, his, dynasty, to, avenge, the, massacre, of, karbal, but, banu, umayya, were, able, to, quickly, suppress, them, all, and, ruled, the, muslim, world, till, they, were, finally, overthrown, by, banu, abb, s, the, rule, of, and, caliphate, of, banu, umayya, came, to, an, end, at, the, hands, of, banu, abb, s, a, branch, of, banu, h, shim, the, tribe, of, muhammad, only, to, usher, another, dynastic, monarchy, styled, as, caliphate, from, 750, ce, this, period, is, seen, formative, in, sunni, islam, as, the, founders, of, the, four, schools, viz, abu, hanifa, malik, ibn, anas, sh, fi, i, and, ahmad, bin, hanbal, all, practised, during, this, time, so, also, did, jafar, al, s, diq, who, elaborated, the, doctrine, of, im, mate, the, basis, for, the, shi, a, religious, thought, there, was, no, clearly, accepted, formula, for, determining, succession, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, two, or, three, sons, or, other, relatives, of, the, dying, caliph, emerged, as, candidates, to, the, throne, each, supported, by, his, own, party, of, supporters, a, trial, of, strength, ensued, and, the, most, powerful, party, won, and, expected, favours, of, the, caliph, they, supported, once, he, ascended, the, throne, the, caliphate, of, this, dynasty, ended, with, the, death, of, the, caliph, al, ma, mun, in, 833, ce, when, the, period, of, turkish, domination, began, the, fall, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, biggest, sunni, empire, for, six, centuries, brought, the, caliphate, to, an, end, this, resulted, in, sunni, protests, in, far, off, places, including, the, khilafat, movement, in, india, which, was, later, on, upon, gaining, independence, from, britain, divided, into, sunni, dominated, pakistan, and, secular, india, pakistan, the, most, populous, sunni, state, at, its, dawn, was, later, partitioned, into, pakistan, and, bangladesh, the, demise, of, ottoman, caliphate, also, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, saudi, arabia, a, dynastic, absolute, monarchy, that, championed, the, reformist, doctrines, of, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, the, eponym, of, the, wahhabi, movement, this, was, followed, by, a, considerable, rise, in, the, influence, of, the, wahhabi, salafiyya, islamist, and, jihadist, movements, that, revived, the, doctrines, of, the, hanbali, theologian, taqi, al, din, ibn, taymiyyah, 1263, 1328, c, e, 661, 728, a, h, a, fervent, advocate, of, the, traditions, of, the, sunni, imam, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, the, expediencies, of, cold, war, resulted, in, the, radicalisation, of, afghan, refugees, in, pakistan, who, fought, the, communist, regime, backed, by, ussr, forces, in, afghanistan, giving, birth, to, the, taliban, movement, after, the, fall, of, communist, regime, in, afghanistan, and, the, ensuing, civil, war, taliban, wrestled, power, from, the, various, mujahidin, factions, in, afghanistan, and, formed, a, government, under, the,

arabia, till, after, 9, 11, perpetrated, by, osama, bin, laden, a, saudi, national, by, birth, and, harboured, by, the, taliban, took, place, resulting, in, a, war, on, terror, launched, against, the, taliban, the, sequence, of, events, of, the, 20th, century, has, led, to, resentment, in, some, quarters, of, the, sunni, community, due, to, the, loss, of, pre, eminence, in, several, previously, sunni, dominated, regions, such, as, the, levant, mesopotamia, the, balkans, the, north, caucasus, and, the, indian, sub, continent, the, latest, attempt, by, a, radical, wing, of, salafi, jihadists, to, re, establish, a, sunni, caliphate, was, seen, in, the, emergence, of, the, militant, group, isil, whose, leader, abu, bakr, al, baghdadi, is, known, among, his, followers, as, caliph, and, amir, al, mu, mineen, the, commander, of, the, faithful, jihadism, is, opposed, from, within, the, muslim, community, known, as, the, ummah, in, arabic, in, all, quarters, of, the, world, as, evidenced, by, turnout, of, almost, 2, of, the, muslim, population, in, london, protesting, against, isil, following, the, puritan, approach, of, ibn, kathir, muhammad, rashid, rida, etc, many, contemporary, tafsir, exegetic, treatises, downplay, the, earlier, significance, of, biblical, material, isr, iliyy, t, half, of, the, arab, commentaries, reject, isr, iliyy, t, in, general, while, turkish, tafsir, usually, partly, allow, referring, to, biblical, material, nevertheless, most, non, arabic, commentators, regard, them, as, useless, or, not, applicable, a, direct, reference, to, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, could, not, be, found, it, remains, unclear, whether, the, refusal, of, isr, iliyy, t, is, motivated, by, political, discourse, or, by, traditionalist, thought, alone, the, usage, of, tafsir, ilmi, is, another, notable, characteristic, of, modern, sunni, tafsir, tafsir, ilmi, stands, for, alleged, scientific, miracles, found, in, the, qur, an, in, short, the, idea, is, that, the, qur, an, contains, knowledge, about, subjects, an, author, of, the, 7th, century, could, not, possibly, have, such, interpretations, are, popular, among, many, commentators, some, scholars, such, as, the, commentators, of, al, azhar, university, reject, this, approach, arguing, the, qur, an, is, a, text, for, religious, guidance, not, for, science, and, scientific, theories, that, may, be, disproved, later, thus, tafsir, ilmi, might, lead, to, interpreting, qur, anic, passages, as, falsehoods, modern, trends, of, islamic, interpretation, are, usually, seen, as, adjusting, to, a, modern, audience, and, purifying, islam, from, alleged, alterings, some, of, which, are, believed, to, be, intentional, corruptions, brought, into, islam, to, undermine, and, corrupt, its, message, sunnis, believe, the, companions, of, muhammad, to, be, reliable, transmitters, of, islam, since, god, and, muhammad, accepted, their, integrity, medieval, sources, even, prohibit, cursing, or, vilifying, them, this, belief, is, based, upon, prophetic, traditions, such, as, one, narrated, by, abdullah, son, of, masud, in, which, muhammad, said, the, best, of, the, people, are, my, generation, then, those, who, come, after, them, then, those, who, come, after, them, support, for, this, view, is, also, found, in, the, qur, an, according, to, sunnis, therefore, narratives, of, companions, are, also, reliably, taken, into, account, for, knowledge, of, the, islamic, faith, sunnis, also, believe, that, the, companions, were, true, believers, since, it, was, the, companions, who, were, given, the, task, of, compiling, the, qur, an, sunni, islam, does, not, have, a, formal, hierarchy, leaders, are, informal, and, gain, influence, through, study, to, become, a, scholar, of, islamic, law, sharia, or, islamic, theology, kal, m, both, religious, and, political, leadership, are, in, principle, open, to, all, muslims, according, to, the, islamic, center, of, columbia, south,

to, lead, the, service, known, as, a, khateeb, one, who, speaks, a, study, conducted, by, the, pew, research, center, in, 2010, and, released, january, 2011, found, that, there, are, 1, 62, billion, muslims, around, the, world, and, it, is, estimated, over, 85, 90, are, sunni, regarding, the, question, which, dogmatic, tendencies, are, to, be, assigned, to, sunnism, there, is, no, agreement, among, muslim, scholars, since, the, early, modern, period, is, the, idea, that, a, total, of, three, groups, belong, to, the, sunnis, 1, those, named, after, abu, l, hasan, al, asch, ari, d, 935, ash, arites, 2, those, named, after, abu, mansur, al, maturidi, d, 941, named, maturidites, and, 3, a, differently, named, third, group, which, is, traditionalistic, oriented, and, rejects, the, rational, discourse, of, kal, m, advocated, by, the, maturidites, and, ash, arites, the, syrian, scholar, abd, al, baqi, ibn, faqih, fussa, d, 1661, calls, this, third, traditionalist, group, the, hanbalites, the, late, ottoman, thinker, smail, hakk, zmirli, d, 1946, who, agreed, to, dividing, sunnis, into, these, three, groups, called, the, traditionalist, group, salafiyya, but, also, used, athariyya, as, an, alternative, term, for, the, maturidiyya, he, gives, nasaf, yya, as, a, possible, alternative, name, another, used, for, the, traditionalist, oriented, group, is, people, of, hadith, ahl, al, ad, it, is, used, for, example, in, the, final, document, of, the, grozny, conference, only, those, people, of, the, hadith, are, assigned, to, sunnism, who, practice, tafw, i, e, who, refrain, from, interpreting, the, ambiguous, statements, of, the, quran, founded, by, abu, al, hasan, al, ash, ari, 873, 935, this, theological, school, of, aqeedah, was, embraced, by, many, muslim, scholars, and, developed, in, parts, of, the, islamic, world, throughout, history, al, ghazali, wrote, on, the, creed, discussing, it, and, agreeing, upon, some, of, its, principles, ash, ari, theology, stresses, divine, revelation, over, human, reason, contrary, to, the, mu, tazilites, they, say, that, ethics, cannot, be, derived, from, human, reason, but, that, god, s, commands, as, revealed, in, the, quran, and, the, sunnah, the, practices, of, muhammad, and, his, companions, as, recorded, in, the, traditions, or, hadith, are, the, sole, source, of, all, morality, and, ethics, regarding, the, nature, of, god, and, the, divine, attributes, the, ash, ari, rejected, the, mu, tazili, position, that, all, quranic, references, to, god, as, having, real, attributes, were, metaphorical, the, ash, aris, insisted, that, these, attributes, were, as, they, best, befit, his, majesty, the, arabic, language, is, a, wide, language, in, which, one, word, can, have, 15, different, meanings, so, the, ash, aris, endeavor, to, find, the, meaning, that, best, befits, god, and, is, not, contradicted, by, the, quran, therefore, when, god, states, in, the, quran, he, who, does, not, resemble, any, of, his, creation, this, clearly, means, that, god, cannot, be, attributed, with, body, parts, because, he, created, body, parts, ash, aris, tend, to, stress, divine, omnipotence, over, human, free, will, and, they, believe, that, the, quran, is, eternal, and, uncreated, founded, by, abu, mansur, al, maturidi, d, 944, the, maturidiyyah, was, the, major, tradition, in, central, asia, based, on, hanafi, law, it, is, more, influenced, by, persian, interpretations, of, islam, and, less, on, the, traditions, established, within, arabian, culture, in, contrast, to, the, traditionalistic, approach, maturidism, allows, to, reject, hadiths, based, on, reason, alone, nevertheless, revelation, remains, important, to, inform, humans, about, that, is, beyond, their, intellectual, limits, such, as, the, concept, of, an, afterlife, ethics, on, the, other, hand, do, not, need, prophecy, or, revelation, but, can, be, understood, by, reason, alone, one, of, the, tribes, the, seljuk, turks, migrated, to, turkey, where, later, the, ottoman, empire, was, established, their, preferred, school, of, law, achieved, a, new, prominence, throughout, their, whole, empire, although, it, continued, to, be, followed, almost, exclusively, by, followers, of, the, hanafi, school, while, followers, of, the, shafi, and, maliki, schools, within, the, empire, followed, the, ash, ari, and, athari, schools, of, thought, thus, wherever, can, be, found, hanafi, followers, there, can, be, found, the, maturidi, creed, traditionalist, or, athari, theology, is, a, movement, of, islamic, scholars, who, reject, rationalistic, islamic, theology, kalam, in, favor, of, strict, textualism, in, interpreting, the, qur, an, and, sunnah, the, name, derives, from, tradition, in, its, technical, sense, as, translation, of, the, arabic, word, hadith, it, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, athari, as, by, several, other, names, adherents, of, traditionalist, theology, believe, that, the, zahir, literal, apparent, meaning, of, the, qur, an, and, the, hadith, have, sole, authority, in, matters, of, belief, and, law, and, that, the, use, of, rational, disputation, is, forbidden, even, if, it, verifies, the, truth, they, engage, in, a, literal, reading, of, the, qur, an, as, opposed, to, one, engaged, in, ta, wil, metaphorical, interpretation, they, do, not, attempt, to, conceptualize, the, meanings, of, the, qur, an, rationally, and, believe, that, their, realities, should, be, consigned, to, god, alone, tafwid, in, essence, the, text, of, the, qur, an, and, hadith, is, accepted, without, asking, how, or, bi, la, kaifa, traditionalist, theology, emerged, among, scholars, of, hadith, who, eventually, coalesced, into, a, movement, called, ahl, al, hadith, under, the, leadership, of, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, in, matters, of, faith, they, were, pitted, against, mu, tazilites, and, other, theological, currents, condemning, many, points, of, their, doctrine, as, well, as, the, rationalistic, methods, they, used, in, defending, them, in, the, 10th, century, ad, al, ash, ari, and, al, maturidi, found, a, middle, ground, between, mu, tazilite, rationalism, and, hanbalite, literalism, using, the, rationalistic, methods, championed, by, mu, tazilites, to, defend, most, tenets, of, the, traditionalist, doctrine, although, the, mainly, hanbali, scholars, who, rejected, this, synthesis, were, in, the, minority, their, emotive, narrative, based, approach, to, faith, remained, influential, among, the, urban, masses, in, some, areas, particularly, in, abbasid, baghdad, while, ash, arism, and, maturidism, are, often, called, the, sunni, orthodoxy, traditionalist, theology, has, thrived, alongside, it, laying, rival, claims, to, be, the, orthodox, sunni, faith, in, the, modern, era, it, has, had, a, disproportionate, impact, on, islamic, theology, having, been, appropriated, by, wahhabi, and, other, traditionalist, salafi, currents, and, have, spread, well, beyond, the, confines, of, the, hanbali, school, of, law, there, were, also, muslim, scholars, who, wanted, to, limit, the, sunni, term, to, the, ash, arites, and, m, tur, dites, alone, for, example, murtad, az, zab, d, d, 1790, wrote, in, his, commentary, on, al, ghazalis, i, y, ul, m, ad, d, n, when, sc, the, term, ahl, as, sunna, wal, jama, a, is, used, the, ash, arites, and, m, tur, dites, are, meant, this, position, was, also, taken, over, by, the, egyptian, fatwa, office, in, july, 2013, in, ottoman, times, many, efforts, were, made, to, establish, a, good, harmony, between, the, teachings, of, the, ash, ar, ya, and, the, m, tur, d, ya, finally, there, were, also, scholars, who, regarded, the, ash, arites, alone, as, sunnis, for, example, the, moroccan, sufi, ahmad, ibn, adschiba, d, 1809, stated, in, his, commentary, on, fatiha, as, far, as, the, sunnis, are, concerned, it, is, the, ash, arites, and, those, who, follow, in, their, correct, belief, conversely, there, were, also, scholars, who, excluded, the, ash, arites, from, sunnism, the, andalusian, scholar, ibn, hazm, d, 1064, said, that, abu, l, hasan, al, ash, ar, belonged, to, the, murji, a, namely, those, who, were, particularly, far, removed, from, the, sunnis, in, terms, of, faith, twentieth, century, syrian, albanian, athari, salafi, theologian, muhammad, nasir, al, din, al, albani, rejected, extremism, in, excluding, ash, aris, from, sunni, islam, he, believed, that, despite, that, their, fundamental, differences, from, atharis, not, every, ash, ari, is, to, be, excluded, from, ahl, al, sunna, wal, jama, ah, unless, they, openly, disapprove, of, the, doctrines, of, the, salaf, mad, hab, as, salaf, according, to, albani, i, do, not, share, some, of, the, noble, scholars, of, the, past, and, present, that, we, say, about, a, group, from, the, islamic, groups, that, it, is, not, from, ahlus, sunnah, due, to, its, deviation, in, one, issue, or, another, as, for, whether, the, ash, aris, or, the, maaturidis, are, from, ahlus, sunnah, wal, jamaa, ah, i, say, that, they, are, from, ahlus, sunnah, wal, jamaa, ah, in, many, things, related, to, aqidah, but, in, other, aqidah, issues, they, have, deviated, away, from, ahlus, sunnah, wal, jamaa, ah, i, don, t, hold, that, we, should, say, that, they, are, not, from, ahlus, sunnah, wal, jamaa, ah, whatsoever, the, hanbali, scholar, ibn, taymiyyah, d, 1328, distinguished, in, his, work, minh, j, as, sunna, between, sunnis, in, the, general, sense, ahl, as, unna, al, mma, and, sunnis, in, the, special, sense, ahl, as, sunna, al, a, sunnis, in, the, general, sense, are, all, muslims, who, recognize, the, caliphate, of, the, three, caliphs, ab, bakr, umar, ibn, al, kha, b, and, uthm, n, ibn, aff, n, in, his, opinion, this, includes, all, islamic, groups, except, the, shiite, rafidites, sunnis, in, the, special, sense, are, only, the, people, of, the, hadith, ahl, al, ad, smail, hakk, zmirli, who, took, over, the, distinction, between, a, broader, and, narrower, circle, of, sunnis, from, ibn, taimiya, said, that, kullabiyya, and, the, ash, ar, yya, are, sunnis, in, the, general, sense, while, the, salafiyya, represent, sunnis, in, the, specific, sense, about, the, maturidiyya, he, only, says, that, they, are, closer, to, the, salafiyya, than, the, ash, ariyya, because, they, excel, more, in, fiqh, than, in, kal, m, the, saudi, scholar, muhammad, ibn, al, uthaimin, d, 2001, who, like, ibn, taimiya, differentiated, between, sunnis, in, general, and, special, senses, also, excluded, the, asharites, from, the, circle, of, sunnis, in, the, special, sense, and, took, the, view, that, only, the, pious, ancestors, as, salaf, a, li, who, have, agreed, on, the, sunnah, belonged, to, this, circle, the, mu, tazilites, are, usually, not, regarded, as, sunnis, ibn, hazm, for, example, contrasted, them, with, the, sunnis, as, a, separate, group, in, his, heresiographic, work, al, fa, l, fi, l, milal, wa, l, ahw, wa, n, ni, al, in, many, medieval, texts, from, the, islamic, east, the, ahl, as, sunna, are, also, differentiated, to, the, mu, tazilites, in, 2010, the, jordanian, fatwa, office, ruled, out, in, a, fatwa, that, the, mu, tazilites, like, the, kharijites, represent, a, doctrine, that, is, contrary, to, sunnism, ibn, taymiyya, argued, that, the, mu, tazilites, belong, to, the, sunnis, in, the, general, sense, because, they, recognize, the, caliphate, of, the, first, three, caliphs, there, is, broad, agreement, that, the, sufis, are, also, part, of, sunnism, this, view, can, already, be, found, in, the, shafi, ite, scholar, abu, mansur, al, baghdadi, d, 1037, in, his, heresiographical, work, al, farq, baina, l, firaq, he, divided, the, sunnis, into, eight, different, categories, a, n, f, of, people, 1, the, theologians, and, kalam, scholars, 2, the, fiqh, scholars, 3, the, traditional, and, hadith, scholars, 4, the, adab, and,

according, to, this, classification, the, sufis, are, one, of, a, total, of, eight, groups, within, sunnism, defined, according, to, their, religious, specialization, the, tunisian, scholar, muhammad, ibn, al, q, sim, al, bakk, d, 1510, also, included, the, sufis, in, sunnism, he, divided, the, sunnis, into, the, following, three, groups, according, to, their, knowledge, istiqr, similarly, murtad, az, zab, d, stated, elsewhere, in, his, commentary, on, ghazzali, s, i, y, ul, m, ad, d, n, that, the, sunnis, consisted, of, four, groups, firaq, namely, the, hadith, scholars, mu, addi, h, n, the, sufis, the, ash, arites, and, the, m, tur, dites, some, ulema, wanted, to, exclude, the, sufis, from, sunnism, the, yemeni, scholar, abb, s, ibn, mans, r, as, saksak, d, 1284, explained, in, his, doxographic, work, al, burh, n, f, ma, rifat, aq, id, ahl, al, ady, n, the, evidence, of, knowledge, of, the, beliefs, of, followers, of, different, religions, about, the, sufis, they, associate, themselves, with, the, sunnis, but, they, do, not, belong, to, them, because, they, contradict, them, in, their, beliefs, actions, and, teachings, that, is, what, distinguishes, the, sufis, from, sunnis, according, to, as, saksak, their, orientation, to, the, hidden, inner, meaning, of, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, in, this, he, said, they, resemble, the, b, tinites, according, to, the, final, document, of, the, grozny, conference, only, those, sufis, are, to, be, regarded, as, sunnis, who, are, people, of, pure, sufism, ahl, at, ta, auwuf, a, f, in, the, knowledge, ethics, and,

sufism, which, had, previously, been, a, less, codified, trend, in, islamic, piety, began, to, be, ordered, and, crystallized, into, tariqahs, orders, which, have, continued, until, the, present, day, all, these, orders, were, founded, by, a, major, sunni, islamic, saint, and, some, of, the, largest, and, most, widespread, included, the, qadiriyya, after, abdul, qadir, gilani, the, rifa, iyya, after, ahmed, al, rifa, i, the, chishtiyya, after, moinuddin, chishti, the, shadiliyya, after, abul, hasan, ash, shadhili, and, the, naqshbandiyya, after, baha, ud, din, naqshband, bukhari, contrary,

lot, of, the, sunni, creeds, attention, the, creed, of, al, q, dir, emphasizes, that, god, did, not, set, himself, up, on, the, throne, ar, in, the, manner, of, the, rest, of, the, creatures, and, that, he, created, this, throne, although, he, did, not, need, it, al, ghazali, s, knowledge, of, the, faith, states, that, the, sitting, down, is, free, from, contact, mum, ssa, with, the, throne, it, is, not, the, throne, that, carries, god, but, the, throne, and, its, bearers, are, carried, through, the, grace, of, his, power, according, to, al, ash, ari, the, sunnis, confess, that, god, is, on, his, throne, but, without, asking, how, even, if, god, does, not, need, the, throne, and, what, is, below, because, he, spatially, occupies, everything, including, what, is, above, him, the, throne, and, stool, kurs, are, a, reality, the, sunnis, confess, that, the, names, of, god, cannot, be, said, to, be, anything, other, than, god, as, mu, tazilites, and, kharijites, claim, rather, they, teach, that, there, are, correlating, attributes, if, t, which, exist, in, each, of, the, names, of, god, mentioned, in, the, quran, god, is, alive, through, life, ay, h, knowing, through, knowledge, ilm, mighty, through, power, qudra, wanting, through, will, ir, da, hearing, through, hearing, sam, seeing, through, sight, ba, ar, and, speaking, through, speech, kal, m, the, attributes, are, not, identical, to, god, nor, are, they, anything, different, from, him, only, those, attributes, are, ascribed, to, god, which, he, ascribed, to, himself, in, the, quran, or, which, his, prophet, ascribed, to, him, and, every, attribute, that, he, or, his, prophet, has, ascribed, to, him, is, a, real, attribute, not, an, attribute, figuratively, sunnis, believe, in, angels, god, hid, the, angels, from, the, vision, of, humans, thus, they, can, usually, not, see, them, just, in, some, special, occusations, god, unveils, them, for, individual, humans, like, when, the, archangel, gabriel, appeared, to, muhammad, one, time, in, his, true, form, with, 600, wings, filling, the, entire, horizon, and, another, time, when, he, was, among, the, circles, of, the, sahaba, in, the, form, of, a, white, clothed, traveller, angels, fulfil, duties, assigned, by, god, the, angel, gabriel, has, the, mission, to, transmit, god, s, revelations, to, chosen, prophets, the, angel, michael, is, assigned, over, rain, and, plants, the, angel, israfil, must, blow, into, the, trumpet, during, thunder, and, the, day, of, resurrection, furthermore, to, the, angels, belong, the, recording, angels, who, supervise, humans, and, the, angel, of, death, who, takes, the, souls, lit, spirits, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, world, unlike, the, mutazilites, and, the, jahmites, the, sunnis, believe, that, satan, whispers, doubts, to, humans, and, hits, them, as, the, quran, states, but, humans, jinn, angels, and, devils, are, all, created, by, the, power, of, god, and, bound, to, his, will, even, if, humans, jinn, angels, and, devils, aligned, to, move, or, stop, one, atom, they, could, not, succeed, without, god, s, will, the, sunnis, further, believe, in, the, books, of, god, sent, to, the, envoys, of, god, to, them, belong, the, quran, the, torah, the, gospel, and, the, psalms, the, quran, is, according, to, sunni, views, the, speech, of, god, who, listens, to, it, and, regards, it, as, human, speech, is, according, to, sunni, creed, by, at, tah, w, an, infidel, the, quran, as, the, speech, of, god, is, sent, down, by, the, trustworthy, spirit, ar, r, al, am, n, surah, 26, 193, and, taught, by, muhammad, god, sent, him, down, as, inspiration, wahy, on, his, messenger, the, path, of, god, s, speech, to, the, community, of, muslims, is, a, multi, stage, process, god, pronounced, it, the, angel, gabriel, heard, it, and, mohammed, repeated, it, mohammed, repeated, it, to, his, companions, and, the, ummah, repeated, them, as, the, speech, of, god, the, quran, is, according, to, sunnism, uncreated, the, teachings, of, the, creation, of, the, quran, is, rejected, by, sunnis, anyone, who, takes, this, teaching, is, regarded, as, an, unbeliever, the, quran, is, recited, with, the, tongue, written, into, books, and, memorized, by, the, heart, but, remains, the, uncreated, speech, of, god, because, it, is, individable, and, can, not, be, split, by, the, transmition, from, heart, to, paper, at, tah, w, specifies, that, the, quran, is, not, created, like, human, speech, rather, it, came, from, god, in, an, unexplained, way, as, a, word, qaul, ibn, taym, ya, explains, that, the, quran, originated, from, god, and, will, return, sc, at, the, end, of, times, too, confessing, to, the, prophets, of, god, is, also, part, of, the, sunni, faith, the, first, of, the, prophets, is, adam, the, original, contract, m, q, that, god, concluded, with, him, and, his, descendants, according, to, sura, 7, 172, 173, is, a, reality, according, to, sunni, belief, god, has, taken, abraham, as, a, friend, al, l, and, talked, to, moses, directly, the, last, of, the, prophets, is, mohammed, from, the, tribe, of, the, quraish, the, sunnis, do, not, differentiate, between, the, messengers, of, god, by, rejecting, some, of, them, but, consider, everything, they, have, brought, to, be, true, god, called, the, prophets, and, presented, their, truthfulness, through, obvious, miracles, the, prophets, conveyed, god, s, command, and, prohibition, his, promise, and, threat, and, it, is, incumbent, on, people, to, believe, what, they, have, brought, to, be, true, god, has, given, people, the, act, of, obedience, a, and, opposition, ma, iya, forbidden, god, s, right, to, the, acts, of, obedience, is, not, only, an, obligation, for, people, through, the, intellect, bi, mu, arrad, al, aql, but, also, through, it, for, making, it, a, duty, through, the, oral, transmission, of, his, prophets, muhammad, from, the, tribe, of, the, quraish, is, not, only, the, seal, of, the, prophets, tam, al, anbiy, rather, god, placed, him, above, all, other, prophets, and, made, him, lord, of, men, saiyid, al, ba, ar, he, is, god, s, chosen, servant, abd, messenger, the, imam, of, the, godly, im, m, al, atqiy, and, the, beloved, of, the, lord, of, the, worlds, ab, b, rabb, al, lam, n, he, is, sent, with, truth, aqq, guidance, hud, and, light, n, r, god, has, him, with, his, message, to, arabs, and, non, arabs, as, well, as, sent, to, the, general, public, of, the, jinn, and, humans, and, with, his, sharia, the, earlier, religious, laws, abrogated, except, that, which, he, has, confirmed, part, of, the, sunnis, path, is, to, follow, the, traditions, r, of, muhammad, internally, and, externally, they, prefer, his, guidance, to, the, guidance, of, anyone, else, muhammad, s, prophethood, is, proven, by, miracles, mu, iz, t, such, as, the, splitting, of, the, moon, the, most, obvious, miracle, is, the, quran, s, inimitability, every, claim, to, prophethood, after, him, is, an, error, or, imagination, since, muhammad, is, the, last, prophet, another, important, point, of, teaching, is, the, belief, in, muhammad, s, ascension, mi, r, accordingly, muhammad, went, on, a, nocturnal, journey, during, which, his, person, was, transported, to, heaven, while, awake, and, from, there, to, heights, which, god, has, chosen, god, gave, him, what, he, had, chosen, for, him, and, gave, him, his, revelation, god, has, also, blessed, him, in, his, life, beyond, and, in, this, world, according, to, sunni, doctrine, people, are, questioned, in, their, graves, by, munkar, and, nakir, after, death, munkar, and, nak, r, are, two, terrifying, huge, figures, who, let, the, person, sit, upright, in, his, grave, with, mind, and, body, and, then, tell, him, about, the, oneness, of, god, and, the, prophethood, of, muhammad, they, ask, him, who, is, your, master, what, is, your, religion, who, is, your, prophet, they, are, the, two, inspectors, of, the, grave, and, their, questioning, is, the, first, test, fitna, of, humans, after, death, the, believer, will, answer, to, this, test, god, is, my, lord, islam, is, my, religion, and, mohammed, is, my, prophet, the, doubter, on, the, other, hand, will, answer, oh, dear, i, don, t, know, i, heard, people, say, something, and, that, s, how, i, said, it, he, is, then, hit, with, an, iron, club, so, that, he, utters, a, loud, scream, that, can, be, heard, by, everyone, except, people, and, jinn, if, people, heard, him, they, would, lose, consciousness, children, are, also, interviewed, by, munkar, and, nak, r, as, well, as, people, who, have, disappeared, drowned, or, were, eaten, by, predatory, animals, deceased, muslims, receive, the, supplication, said, for, them, and, the, sadaqa, spoken, in, their, name, are, a, favor, for, them, another, point, of, belief, are, the, signs, of, the, hour, a, r, as, s, a, that, precede, the, day, of, resurrection, this, includes, the, emergence, of, the, dajjal, the, rising, of, the, sun, in, the, west, the, emergence, of, the, dabba, from, the, earth, and, the, excerpt, from, gog, and, magog,

thrown, into, the, scales, of, darkness, in, an, ugly, form, and, reduce, the, weight, of, the, scales, through, the, justice, adl, of, god, the, teachings, of, the, sunnis, also, include, the, vision, of, god, ru, yat, all, h, in, the, hereafter, which, has, similarities, with, the, visio, beatifica, in, the, christian, tradition, with, this, teaching, the, sunnis, set, themselves, apart, from, the, mu, tazilites, the, zaidiyyah, and, the, philosophers, who, consider, the, vision, of, god, intellectually, impossible, there, are, differing, views, among, sunni, scholars, about, the, timing, and, type, of, the, divine, vision, al, ashari, states, that, god, is, seen, on, the, day, of, resurrection, whereby, only, the, believers, see, him, the, unbelievers, not, because, they, are, kept, away, from, god, at, tah, w, on, the, other, hand, was, of, the, opinion, that, the, vision, of, god, was, a, reality, for, the, inmates, of, paradise, ibn, taim, ya, doubles, the, vision, of, god, people, see, god, while, they, are, still, in, the, places, of, the, resurrection, and, then, after, entering, paradise, as, for, the, way, of, seeing, god, al, ash, aari, and, ibn, taimiyah, emphasized, its, visual, characteristics, al, ashari, meant, that, god, can, be, seen, with, the, eyes, just, as, one, sees, the, moon, on, the, night, of, the, full, moon, ibn, taim, ya, adds, that,

serious, sinners, from, muhammad, s, ummah, they, are, in, hell, but, not, forever, if, they, were, monotheists, at, the, time, of, death, what, happens, to, them, lies, within, god, if, he, wants, he, forgives, them, through, his, grace, fa, l, and, if, he, wants, he, punishes, them, in, his, justice, adl, and, then, brings, them, through, his, mercy, ra, ma, and, through, the, intercession,

total, of, the, intercession, of, the, prophets, then, the, scholars, then, the, martyrs, then, to, believe, the, other, believers, in, accordance, with, their, dignity, and, their, rank, in, god, those, of, the, believers, who, have, no, advocate, will, be, brought, out, of, hell, by, the, grace, of, god, according, to, sunni, doctrine, everything, that, happens, happens, through, god, s, decision, qad, and, predestination, qadar, or, his, determination, taqd, r, predestination, includes, the, predestination, of, good, and, bad, sweet, and, bitter, god, has, that, the, measured, qadar,

righteous, in, his, judgments, aq, iya, but, his, righteousness, cannot, be, decided, by, analogy, with, the, righteousness, of, people, because, unjust, actions, for, people, are, only, conceivable, with, regard, to, someone, else, s, property, but, god, does, not, encounter, someone, else, s, property, anywhere, so, that, he, could, behave, unfairly, to, him, the, principle, of, predestination, is, god, s, mystery, with, regard, to, his, creatures, no, archangel, and, no, prophet, is, informed, of, this, reflecting, on, predestination, leads, to, destruction, and, is, a, step, toward, rebellion, against, god, because, he, has, hidden, the, knowledge, about, it, from, people, it, is, made, easy, for, everyone, for, what, they, were, created, for, blessed, are, whose, who, are, saved, by, god, s, judgment, qa, all, h, condemned, are, whose, who, are, condemned, by, the, judgment, of, god, god, created, paradise, and, hell, above, all, else, then, he, created, the, people, who, are, worthy, of, them, he, has, designated, some, out, of, generosity, fa, lan, for, paradise, the, others, out, of, justice, adlan, for, hell, god, has, always, known, the, number, of, those, who, go, to, paradise, and, the, number, of, those, who, go, to, hell, this, number, is, neither, increased, nor, decreased, when, god, creates, the, body, of, the, embryo, he, sends, an, angel, to, him, who, writes, down, his, livelihood, rizq, the, hour, he, dies, his, deeds, and, whether, he, is, a, damned, aq, or, a, blessed, sa, d, the, sunni, believer, does, not, doubt, his, belief, humans, neither, know, how, they, are, registered, by, god, whether, as, believers, or, unbelievers, nor, how, it, ends, with, them, god, is, also, the, converter, of, hearts, muqallib, al, qul, b, therefore, it, is, recommended, to, say, a, believer, if, god, is, willing, or, i, hope, that, i, am, a, believer, such, a, way, of, expression, does, not, make, people, into, doubters, because, by, that, they, only, mean, that, their, otherworldly, fate, and, their, end, are, hidden, from, them, the, sunnis, do, not, speak, to, any, of, the, people, who, pray, to, the, kaaba, to, paradise, or, hell,

his, death, and, is, accepted, by, all, sects, of, islam, many, matters, of, belief, and, daily, life, were, not, directly, prescribed, in, the, quran, but, were, actions, observed, by, muhammad, and, the, early, muslim, community, later, generations, sought, out, oral, traditions, regarding, the, early, history, of, islam, and, the, practices, of, muhammad, and, his, first, followers, and, wrote, them, down, so, that, they, might, be, preserved, these, recorded, oral, traditions, are, called, hadith, muslim, scholars, have, through, the, ages, sifted, through, the, hadith, and, evaluated, the, chain, of, narrations, of, each, tradition, scrutinizing, the, trustworthiness, of, the, narrators, and, judging, the, strength, of, each, hadith, accordingly, kutub, al, sittah, are, six, books, containing, collections, of, hadiths, sunni, muslims, accept, the, hadith, collections, of, bukhari, and, muslim, as, the, most, authentic, sahih, and, while, accepting, all, hadiths, verified, as, authentic, grant, a, slightly, lesser, status, to, the, collections, of, other, recorders, four, other, hadith, collections, are, also, held, in, particular, reverence, by, sunni, muslims, making, a, total, of, six, there, are, also, other, collections, of, hadith, which, also, contain, many, authentic, hadith, and, are, frequently, used, by, scholars, and, specialists, examples, of, these, collections, include, one, of, the, most, important, teaching, institutions, of, sunni, islam, worldwide, is, the, azhar, in, egypt, article, 32b, paragraph, 7, of, the, egyptian, azhar, law, of, 1961, stipulates, that, the, azhar, follows, the, path, of, the, sunnis, manha, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jam, a, umma, has, agreed, to, the, foundations, of, the, religion, and, applications, of, fiqh, with, its, four, disciplines, only, those, who, stick, to, the, paths, of, their, science, and, behavior, can, become, a, member, of, the, council, of, great, scholars, hai, at, kib, r, al, ulam, among, whom, the, grand, imam, of, al, azhar, is, elected, zitouna, university, in, tunisia, and, university, of, al, qarawiyyin, in, morocco, are, recognized, they, are, also, mentioned, along, with, the, azhar, in, the, final, document, of, the, sunni, conference, in, grozny, another, body, that, claims, to, speak, on, behalf, of, sunnism, is, the, council, of, senior, religious, scholars, founded, in, saudi, arabia, in, 1971, in, the, past, the, committee, has, expressed, several, times, on, fatwas, about, the, sunni, membership, of, certain, islamic, groups, within, in, 1986, it, published, a, fatwa, excluding, the, ahb, sh, community, from, sunnism, the, islamic, world, league, in, mecca, also, funded, by, saudi, arabia, made, a, resolution, from, 1987, that, it, regards, sunnism, as, the, pure, teachings, at, the, time, of, the, messenger, and, the, rightful, existence, of, the, caliphate, however, the, council, of, senior, religious, scholars, is, largely, under, control, of, wahhabi, scholars, the, turkish, directorate, of, religious, affairs, diyanet, leri, ba, kanl, follows, the, religious, policy, of, the, ottoman, empire, providing, a, sunni, interpretation, of, islam, plans, by, the, committee, of, national, unity, in, the, 1960s, to, convert, the, diyanet, authority, into, a, non, denominational, institution, that, also, integrated, the, alevis, failed, because, of, resistance, from, conservative, sunni, clergy, inside, and, outside, the, diyanet, authority, since, the, 1990s, the, diyanet, authority, has, presented, itself, as, an, institution, that, stands, above, the, denominations, mezhepler, st, the, religious, education, organized, by, the, authority, at, the, turkish, schools, is, based, exclusively, on, the, sunni, understanding, of, islam, a, well, known, hadith, which, is, to, be, interpreted, as, vaticinium, ex, eventu, says, that, the, muslim, umma, will, split, into, 73, sects, only, one, of, which, will, be, saved, the, sunnis, have, the, idea, that, they, are, this, saved, sect, firqa, n, niya, for, example, abu, mansur, al, baghdadi, d, 1037, explains, at, the, beginning, of, his, heresiographical, work, al, farq, baina, l, firaq, the, difference, between, the, sects, that, there, are, 20, rafiditic, 20, kharijite, 20, qadaritic, 3, murjiite, 3, nadj, ritic, 3, karramitic, and, furthermore, bakriyya, dirariyyya, and, jahm, ya, these, are, the, 72, erring, sects, the, 73rd, sect, that, is, the, saved, sect, are, the, sunnis, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jama, a, according, to, al, baghdadi, they, are, composed, of, two, groups, namely, the, followers, of, the, ra, y, and, the, followers, of, the, hadith, they, agreed, on, the, fundamentals, of, religion, u, l, ad, d, n, there, were, only, differences, in, the, derivations, fur, from, the, norms, regarding, the, question, of, what, permitted, and, what, forbidden, is, these, differences, are, not, so, great, that, they, considered, each, other, to, have, strayed, from, the, right, path, later, sunni, scholars, also, present, the, sunnis, as, the, center, of, muslim, community, the, idea, already, appears, to, some, extent, in, the, ash, arite, abd, al, q, hir, al, baghd, d, who, emphasizes, on, several, dogmatic, questions, that, the, sunnis, hold, a, position, that, lies, in, the, middle, between, the, positions, of, the, other, islamic, groups, an, example, is, the, question, of, predestination, qadar, in, which, according, to, the, kasb, theory, you, hold, exactly, the, middle, between, the, two, extreme, positions, of, the, jabriyya, and, the, qadariyya, the, hanbali, scholar, ibn, taymiyya, d, 1328, who, was, otherwise, known, for, his, uncompromising, attitude, also, adhered, to, this, view, he, said, that, the, sunnis, represented, the, middle, among, the, sects, of, the, umma, al, wasa, f, firaq, al, umma, just, as, the, islamic, umma, is, the, middle, between, the, other, religious, communities, he, illustrates, this, with, the, following, examples, the, hanafi, scholar, al, al, q, r, d, 1606, continued, this, idea, later, in, his, anti, shiite, pamphlet, amm, al, alaw, ri, f, amm, ar, raw, fi, he, quotes, a, tradition, according, to, which, al, ibn, ab, t, lib, said, two, kinds, of, people, perish, on, me, the, exaggerated, lover, and, the, exaggerated, hater, he, notes, that, the, exaggerated, lover, is, the, rafidites, and, the, exaggerated, hater, is, the, kharijit, the, sunni, on, the, other, hand, loves, al, in, high, esteem, and, is, thus, in, the,

and, efforts, of, which, muslims, are, proud, al, baghd, d, explains, that, the, sunnis, have, a, major, share, in, the, last, chapter, of, his, book, al, baghdadi, also, relates, this, to, building, activity, in, islamic, countries, he, believes, that, the, sunnis, with, their, mosques, madrasas, palaces, factories, and, hospitals, have, achieved, an, unattainable, position, because, none, of, the, non, sunnis, have, performed, such, services, since, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, there, have, been, fierce, clashes, within, the, sunni, camps, between, ash, arites, on, the, one,

he, explicitly, excluded, the, ahl, as, salaf, from, sunnism, among, other, things, he, argued, that, there, was, no, salafi, madhhab, in, the, first, 300, years, of, islam, from, this, he, deduced, that, those, who, called, other, muslims, to, obey, the, salafi, madhhab, were, promoting, a, madhhab, which, did, not, even, exist, in, his, view, only, the, ash, arites, were, real, sunnis, abbas, books, served, as, the, theological, basis, for, anti, salafist, campaigns, in, aceh, in, 2014, during, these, campaigns, various, salafist, schools, in, aceh, were, closed, by, the, provincial, government, the, permanent, committee, for, scholarly, research, and, ifta, in, saudi, arabia, issued, a, fatwa, in, 1996, stating, that, salafis, are, sunnis, like, many, ash, arites, the, salafis, believe, their, teachings, are, the, only, true, form, of, sunnism, and, hence, reject, the, asharites, and, maturidites, as, part, of, sunnism, an, example, is, the, saudi, scholar, muhammad, ibn, al, uthaim, n, who, in, his, 2001, published, commentary, on, aq, da, w, si, ya, by, ibn, taimiyya, expressed, the, opinion, that, ash, arites, and, m, tur, dites, would, not, count, among, the, sunnis, because, their, doctrine, of, attributes, would, be, in, contrast, to, the, doctrine, of, muhammad, and, his, companions, for, this, reason, the, view, that, three, groups, belong, to, sunnism, should, also, be, rejected, sunnis, are, only, those, who, are, salaf, in, terms, of, belief, the, accusation, by, some, wahhabis, that, the, ash, arites, were, not, sunnis, was, subject, of, a, fatwa, by, the, egyptian, fatwa, office, in, july, 2013, in, its, fatwa, the, office, rejected, this, accusation, affirming, that, the, ash, arites, still, represented, the, multitude, of, scholars, jumh, r, al, ulam, and, stressed, out, that, they, were, the, ones, who, in, the, past, rejected, the, arguments, of, the, atheists, ubuh, t, al, mal, ida, anyone, who, declares, them, to, be, unbelieving, or, who, doubts, their, orthodoxy, should, fear, for, their, religion, on, the, same, day, the, fatwa, office, made, clear, in, a, fatwa, that, according, to, their, understanding,

took, part, including, ahmed, el, tayeb, the, grand, imam, of, the, azhar, and, sheikh, aboobacker, ahmed, the, grand, mufti, of, india, according, to, its, organizers, the, conference, should, mark, a, blessed, turning, point, in, efforts, to, correct, the, serious, and, dangerous, distortion, of, religion, by, those, extremists, trying, to, usurp, the, venerable, name, of, ahl, al, sunna, wa, al, jama, a, him, to, coin, exclusively, on, itself, and, to, exclude, its, true, representatives, from, it, in, the, final, declaration, the, salafis, and, islamist, groups, like, muslim, brotherhood, hizb, ut, tahrir, etc, and, the, takfiri, organisations, like, isil, were, excluded, from, sunni, islam, in, response, to, this, various, prominent, salafiyya, figures, held, a, counter, conference, in, kuwait, in, november, 2016, under, the, title, the, correct, meaning, of, sunnism, al, mafh, m, a, a, li, ahl, as, sunna, wa, l, jama, in, which, they, also, distanced, themselves, from, extremist, groups, but, at, the, same, time, insisted, that, salafiyya, was, not, only, part, of, sunnism, but, represented, sunnism, itself, the, conference, was, chaired, by, ahmad, ibn, murabit, grand, mufti, of, mauritania, a, few, days, later, grand, imam, of, al, azhar, ahmed, el, tayeb, publicly, distanced, himself, from, the, final, declaration, of, the, grozny, conference,
