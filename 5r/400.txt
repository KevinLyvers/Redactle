many, of, her, functions, in, the, everyday, lives, of, men, and, women, such, as, protecting, the, vegetation, and, supplying, assistance, in, childbirth, were, transferred, to, the, virgin, mary, however, freyja, did, not, disappear, in, iceland, freyja, was, called, upon, for, assistance, by, way, of, icelandic, magical, staves, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, and, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, freyja, is, recorded, as, retaining, elements, of, her, role, as, a, fertility, goddess, among, rural, swedes, the, old, norse, poem, rymskvi, a, or, its, source, continued, into, scandinavian, folk, song, tradition, where, it, was, euhemerized, and, otherwise, transformed, over, time, in, iceland, the, poem, became, known, as, rylur, whereas, in, denmark, the, poem, became, thor, af, havsgaard, and, in, sweden, it, became, torvisan, or, hammarh, mtningen, a, section, of, the, swedish, torvisan, in, which, freyja, has, been, transformed, into, the, fair, den, v, na,

those, days, when, the, sheet, lightning, flared, at, the, night, katrina, said, don, t, be, afraid, little, child, it, is, only, freyja, who, is, out, making, fire, with, steel, and, flintstone, to,

apple, trees, for, the, sake, of, a, good, harvest, and, consequently, people, left, some, apples, in, the, trees, for, her, sake, however, it, was, dangerous, to, leave, the, plough, outdoors, because, if, freyja, sat, on, it, it, would, no, longer, be, of, any, use, many, asatru, practitioners, today, mostly, honor, freyja, as, a, goddess, of, fertility, abundance, and, beauty, a, common, rite, for, modern, freya, worshippers, is, to, bake, foods, that, have, some, connection, to, love, in, one, way, or, another, such, as, chocolate, freyja, is, also, called, upon, for, protection, usually, when, it, comes, to, a, domestic, violence, situation, several, plants, were, named, after, freyja, such, as, freyja, s, tears, and, freyja, s, hair, polygala, vulgaris, but, during, the, process, of, christianization, the, name, of, the, goddess, was, replaced, with, that, of, the, virgin, mary, in, the, pre, christian, period, the, orion, constellation, was, called, either, frigg, s,

compounded, with, words, for, meadow, such, as, veit, land, and, similar, land, formations, these, toponyms, are, attested, most, commonly, on, the, west, coast, though, a, high, frequency, is, found, in, the, southeast, place, names, containing, freyja, are, yet, more, numerous, and, varied, in, sweden, where, they, are, widely, distributed, a, particular, concentration, is, recorded, in, uppland, among, which, a, number, derive, from, the, above, mentioned, freyjuv, and, also, freyjulundr, freyja, s, sacred, grove, place, names, that, indicate, public, worship, of, freyja, a, variety, of, place, names, such, as, fr, al, and, fr, ale, have, been, seen, as, containing, an, element, cognate, to, gothic, alhs, and, old, english, ealh, temple, although, these, place, names, may, be, otherwise, interpreted, in, addition, frejya, appears, as, a, compound, element, with, a, variety, of, words, for, geographic, features, such, as, fields, meadows, lakes, and, natural, objects, such, as, rocks, the, freyja, name, h, rn, appears, in, the, swedish, place, names, h, rnevi, and, j, rnevi, stemming, from, the, reconstructed, old, norse, place, name, h, rnar, v, meaning, h, rn, s, v, a,

horses, a, wagon, and, an, arabian, bronze, pitcher, there, was, also, a, silver, pendant, which, represents, a, woman, with, a, broad, necklace, around, her, neck, this, kind, of, necklace, was, only, worn, by, the, most, prominent, women, during, the, iron, age, and, some, have, interpreted, it, as, freyja, s, necklace, br, singamen, the, pendant, may, represent, freyja, herself, a, 7th,

holding, a, staff, like, object, this, figure, has, been, interpreted, as, freyja, this, image, may, be, connected, to, various, b, type, bracteates, referred, to, as, the, f, rstenberg, type, that, may, also, depict, the, goddess, they, show, a, female, figure, in, a, short, skirt, and, double, looped, hair, holding, a, stave, or, sceptre, in, her, right, hand, and, a, double, cross, feature,

cats, scholars, have, linked, this, depiction, to, freyja, s, cat, led, chariot, and, a, broader, associations, between, the, vanir, and, wagons, a, 12th, century, depiction, of, a, cloaked, but, otherwise, nude, woman, riding, a, large, cat, appears, on, a, wall, in, the, schleswig, cathedral, in, schleswig, holstein, northern, germany, beside, her, is, similarly, a, cloaked, yet, otherwise, nude, woman, riding, a, distaff, due, to, iconographic, similarities, to, the, literary, record, these, figures, have, been, theorized, as, depictions, of, freyja, and, frigg, respectively, due, to, numerous, similarities, scholars, have, frequently, connected, freyja, with, the, goddess, frigg, the, connection, with, frigg, and, question, of, possible, earlier, identification, of, freyja, with, frigg, in, the, proto, germanic, period, frigg, and, freyja, common, origin, hypothesis, remains, a, matter, of, scholarly, discourse, regarding, a, freyja, frigg, common, origin, hypothesis, scholar, stephan, grundy, comments, the, problem, of, whether, frigg, or, freyja, may, have, been, a, single, goddess, originally, is, a, difficult, one, made, more, so, by, the, scantiness, of, pre, viking, age, references, to, germanic, goddesses, and, the, diverse, quality, of, the, sources, the, best, that, can, be, done, is, to, survey, the, arguments, for, and, against, their, identity, and, to, see, how, well, each, can, be, supported, like, the, name, of, the, group, of, gods, to, which, freyja, belongs, the, vanir, the, name, freyja, is, not, attested, outside, of, scandinavia, as, opposed, to, the, name, of, the, goddess, frigg, who, is, attested, as, a, goddess, common, among, the, germanic, peoples, and, whose, name, is, reconstructed, as, proto, germanic, frijj, similar, proof, for, the, existence, of, a, common, germanic, goddess, from, which, freyja, descends, does, not, exist, but, scholars, have, commented, that, this, may, simply, be, due, to, lack, of, evidence, in, the, poetic, edda, poem, v, lusp, a, figure, by, the, name, of, gullveig, is, burnt, three, times, yet, is, three, times, reborn, after, her, third, rebirth, she, is, known, as, hei, r, this, event, is, generally, accepted, as, precipitating, the, sir, vanir, war, starting, with, scholar, gabriel, turville, petre, scholars, such, as, rudolf, simek, andy, orchard, and, john, lindow, have, theorized, that, gullveig, hei, r, is, the, same, figure, as, freyja, and, that, her, involvement, with, the, sir, somehow, led, to, the, events, of, the, sir, vanir, war, outside, of, theories, connecting, freyja, with, the, goddess, frigg, some, scholars, such, as, hilda, ellis, davidson, and, britt, mari, n, sstr, m, have, theorized, that, other, goddesses, in, norse, mythology, such, as, gefjon, ger, r, and, ska, i, may, be, forms, of, freyja, in, different, roles, or, ages, freyja, and, her, afterlife, field, f, lkvangr, where, she, receives, half, of, the, slain, have, been, theorized, as, connected, to, the, valkyries, scholar, britt, mari, n, sstr, m, points, out, the, description, in, gylfaginning, where, it, is, said, of, freyja, that, whenever, she, rides, into, battle, she, takes, half, of, the, slain, and, interprets, f, lkvangr, as, the, field, of, the, warriors, n, sstr, m, notes, that, just, like, odin, freyja, receives, slain, heroes, who, have, died, on, the, battlefield, and, that, her, house, is, sessrumnir, which, she, translates, as, filled, with, many, seats, a, dwelling, that, n, sstr, m, posits, likely, fills, the, same, function, as, valhalla, n, sstr, m, comments, that, still, we, must, ask, why, there, are, two, heroic, paradises, in, the, old, norse, view, of, afterlife, it, might, possibly, be, a, consequence, of, different, forms, of, initiation, of, warriors, where, one, part, seemed, to, have, belonged, to, inn, and, the, other, to, freyja, these, examples, indicate, that, freyja, was, a, war, goddess, and, she, even, appears, as, a, valkyrie, literally, the, one, who, chooses, the, slain, siegfried, andres, dobat, comments, that, in, her, mythological, role, as, the, chooser, of, half, the, fallen, warriors, for, her, death, realm, f, lkvangr, the, goddess, freyja, however, emerges, as, the, mythological, role, model, for, the, valkyrjar, and, the, d, sir, gustav, neckel, writing, in, 1920, connects, freyja, to, the, phrygian, goddess, cybele, according, to, neckel, both, goddesses, can, be, interpreted, as, fertility, goddesses, and, other, potential, resemblances, have, been, noted, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, image, of, cybele, subsequently, influenced, the, iconography, of, freyja, the, lions, drawing, the, former, s, chariot, becoming, large, cats, these, observations, became, an, extremely, common, observation, in, works, regarding, old, norse, religion, until, at, least, the, early, 1990s, in, her, book, length, study, of, scholarship, on, the, topic, of, freyja, britt, mari, n, sstr, m, 1995, is, highly, critical, of, this, deduction, n, sstr, m, says, that, these, parallels, are, due, to, sheer, ignorance, about, the, characteristics, of, cybele, scholars, have, not, troubled, to, look, into, the, resemblances, and, differences, between, the, two, goddesses, if, any, in, support, for, their, arguments, for, a, common, origin, into, the, modern, period, freyja, was, treated, as, a, scandinavian, counterpart, to, the, roman, venus, in, for, example, swedish, literature, where, the, goddess, may, be, associated, with, romantic, love, or, conversely, simply, as, a, synonym, for, lust, and, potency, in, the, 18th, century, swedish, poet, carl, michael, bellman, referred, to, stockholm, prostitutes, in, his, fredman, s, epistles, as, the, children, of, fr, ja, in, the, 19th, century, britt, mari, n, sstr, m, observes, swedish, romanticism, focused, less, on, freyja, s, erotic, qualities, and, more, on, the, image, of, the, pining, goddess, weeping, for, her, husband, freyja, is, mentioned, in, the, first, stanza, it, is, called, old, denmark, and, it, is, freja, s, hall, of, the, civil, national, anthem, of, denmark, der, er, et,
