antiquity, medieval, early, modern, modern, iran, india, east, asia, religion, is, a, range, of, social, cultural, systems, including, designated, behaviors, and, practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified, places, prophecies, ethics, or, organizations, that, generally, relate, humanity, to, supernatural, transcendental, and, spiritual, elements, although, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, over, what, precisely, constitutes, a, religion, different, religions, may, or, may, not, contain, various, elements, ranging, from, the, divine, sacredness, faith, and, a, supernatural, being, or, beings, the, origin, of, religious, belief, is, an, open, question, with, possible, explanations, including, awareness, of, individual, death, a, sense, of, community, and, dreams, religions, have, sacred, histories, narratives, and, mythologies, preserved, in, oral, traditions, sacred, texts, symbols, and, holy, places, that, may, attempt, to, explain, the, origin, of, life, the, universe, and, other, phenomena, religious, practices, may, include, rituals, sermons, commemoration, or, veneration, of, deities, or, saints, sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, matrimonial, and, funerary, services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, or, public, service, there, are, an, estimated, 10, 000, distinct, religions, worldwide, though, nearly, all, of, them, have, regionally, based, relatively, small, followings, four, religions, christianity, islam, hinduism, and, buddhism, account, for, over, 77, of, the, world, s, population, and, 92, of, the, world, either, follows, one, of, those, four, religions, or, identifies, as, nonreligious, meaning, that, the, remaining, 9, 000, faiths, account, for, only, 8, of, the, population, combined, the, religiously, unaffiliated, demographic, includes, those, who, do, not, identify, with, any, particular, religion, atheists, and, agnostics, although, many, in, the, demographic, still, have, various, religious, beliefs, many, world, religions, are, also, organized, religions, most, definitively, including, the, abrahamic, religions, christianity, islam, and, judaism, while, others, are, arguably, less, so, in, particular, folk, religions, indigenous, religions, and, some, eastern, religions, a, portion, of, the, world, s, population, are, members, of, new, religious, movements, scholars, have, indicated, that, global, religiosity, may, be, increasing, due, to, religious, countries, having, generally, higher, birth, rates, the, study, of, religion, comprises, a, wide, variety, of, academic, disciplines, including, theology, philosophy, of, religion, comparative, religion, and, social, scientific, studies, theories, of, religion, offer, various, explanations, for, its, origins, and, workings, including, the, ontological, foundations, of, religious, being, and, belief, the, term, religion, comes, from, both, old, french, and, anglo, norman, 1200s, ce, and, means, respect, for, sense, of, right, moral, obligation, sanctity, what, is, sacred, reverence, for, the, gods, it, is, ultimately, derived, from, the, latin, word, religi, according, to, roman, philosopher, cicero, religi, comes, from, relegere, re, meaning, again, lego, meaning, read, where, lego, is, in, the, sense, of, go, over, choose, or, consider, carefully, contrarily, some, modern, scholars, such, as, tom, harpur, and, joseph, campbell, have, argued, that, religi, is, derived, from, religare, re, meaning, again, ligare, bind, or, connect, which, was, made, prominent, by, st, augustine, following, the, interpretation, given, by, lactantius, in, divinae, institutiones, iv, 28, the, medieval, usage, alternates, with, order, in, designating, bonded, communities, like, those, of, monastic, orders, we, hear, of, the, religion, of, the, golden, fleece, of, a, knight, of, the, religion, of, avys, in, classic, antiquity, religi, broadly, meant, conscientiousness, sense, of, right, moral, obligation, or, duty, to, anything, in, the, ancient, and, medieval, world, the, etymological, latin, root, religi, was, understood, as, an, individual, virtue, of, worship, in, mundane, contexts, never, as, doctrine, practice, or, actual, source, of, knowledge, in, general, religi, referred, to, broad, social, obligations, towards, anything, including, family, neighbors, rulers, and, even, towards, god, religi, was, most, often, used, by, the, ancient, romans, not, in, the, context, of, a, relation, towards, gods, but, as, a, range, of, general, emotions, which, arose, from, heightened, attention, in, any, mundane, context, such, as, hesitation, caution, anxiety, or, fear, as, well, as, feelings, of, being, bound, restricted, or, inhibited, the, term, was, also, closely, related, to, other, terms, like, scrupulus, which, meant, very, precisely, and, some, roman, authors, related, the, term, superstitio, which, meant, too, much, fear, or, anxiety, or, shame, to, religi, at, times, when, religi, came, into, english, around, the, 1200s, as, religion, it, took, the, meaning, of, life, bound, by, monastic, vows, or, monastic, orders, the, compartmentalized, concept, of, religion, where, religious, and, worldly, things, were, separated, was, not, used, before, the, 1500s, the, concept, of, religion, was, first, used, in, the, 1500s, to, distinguish, the, domain, of, the, church, and, the, domain, of, civil, authorities, the, peace, of, augsburg, marks, such, instance, which, has, been, described, by, christian, reus, smit, as, the, first, step, on, the, road, toward, a, european, system, of, sovereign, states, roman, general, julius, caesar, used, religi, to, mean, obligation, of, an, oath, when, discussing, captured, soldiers, making, an, oath, to, their, captors, roman, naturalist, pliny, the, elder, used, the, term, religi, to, describe, the, apparent, respect, given, by, elephants, to, the, night, sky, cicero, used, religi, as, being, related, to, cultum, deorum, worship, of, the, gods, in, ancient, greece, the, greek, term, threskeia, was, loosely, translated, into, latin, as, religi, in, late, antiquity, threskeia, was, sparsely, used, in, classical, greece, but, became, more, frequently, used, in, the, writings, of, josephus, in, the, 1st, century, ce, it, was, used, in, mundane, contexts, and, could, mean, multiple, things, from, respectful, fear, to, excessive, or, harmfully, distracting, practices, of, others, to, cultic, practices, it, was, often, contrasted, with, the, greek, word, deisidaimonia, which, meant, too, much, fear, religion, is, a, modern, concept, the, concept, was, invented, recently, in, the, english, language, and, is, found, in, texts, from, the, 17th, century, due, to, events, such, as, the, splitting, of, christendom, during, the, protestant, reformation, and, globalization, in, the, age, of, exploration, which, involved, contact, with, numerous, foreign, cultures, with, non, european, languages, some, argue, that, regardless, of, its, definition, it, is, not, appropriate, to, apply, the, term, religion, to, non, western, cultures, while, some, followers, of, various, faiths, rebuke, using, the, word, to, describe, their, own, belief, system, the, concept, of, ancient, religion, stems, from, modern, interpretations, of, a, range, of, practices, that, conform, to, a, modern, concept, of, religion, influenced, by, early, modern, and, 19th, century, christian, discourse, the, concept, of, religion, was, formed, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, despite, the, fact, that, ancient, sacred, texts, like, the, bible, the, quran, and, others, did, not, have, a, word, or, even, a, concept, of, religion, in, the, original, languages, and, neither, did, the, people, or, the, cultures, in, which, these, sacred, texts, were, written, for, example, there, is, no, precise, equivalent, of, religion, in, hebrew, and, judaism, does, not, distinguish, clearly, between, religious, national, racial, or, ethnic, identities, one, of, its, central, concepts, is, halakha, meaning, the, walk, or, path, sometimes, translated, as, law, which, guides, religious, practice, and, belief, and, many, aspects, of, daily, life, even, though, the, beliefs, and, traditions, of, judaism, are, found, in, the, ancient, world, ancient, jews, saw, jewish, identity, as, being, about, an, ethnic, or, national, identity, and, did, not, entail, a, compulsory, belief, system, or, regulated, rituals, in, the, 1st, century, ce, josephus, had, used, the, greek, term, ioudaismos, judaism, as, an, ethnic, term, and, was, not, linked, to, modern, abstract, concepts, of, religion, or, a, set, of, beliefs, the, very, concept, of, judaism, was, invented, by, the, christian, church, and, it, was, in, the, 19th, century, that, jews, began, to, see, their, ancestral, culture, as, a, religion, analogous, to, christianity, the, greek, word, threskeia, which, was, used, by, greek, writers, such, as, herodotus, and, josephus, is, found, in, the, new, testament, threskeia, is, sometimes, translated, as, religion, in, today, s, translations, but, the, term, was, understood, as, generic, worship, well, into, the, medieval, period, in, the, quran, the, arabic, word, din, is, often, translated, as, religion, in, modern, translations, but, up, to, the, mid, 1600s, translators, expressed, din, as, law, the, sanskrit, word, dharma, sometimes, translated, as, religion, also, means, law, throughout, classical, south, asia, the, study, of, law, consisted, of, concepts, such, as, penance, through, piety, and, ceremonial, as, well, as, practical, traditions, medieval, japan, at, first, had, a, similar, union, between, imperial, law, and, universal, or, buddha, law, but, these, later, became, independent, sources, of, power, though, traditions, sacred, texts, and, practices, have, existed, throughout, time, most, cultures, did, not, align, with, western, conceptions, of, religion, since, they, did, not, separate, everyday, life, from, the, sacred, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, terms, buddhism, hinduism, taoism, confucianism, and, world, religions, first, entered, the, english, language, native, americans, were, also, thought, of, as, not, having, religions, and, also, had, no, word, for, religion, in, their, languages, either, no, one, self, identified, as, a, hindu, or, buddhist, or, other, similar, terms, before, the, 1800s, hindu, has, historically, been, used, as, a, geographical, cultural, and, later, religious, identifier, for, people, indigenous, to, the, indian, subcontinent, throughout, its, long, history, japan, had, no, concept, of, religion, since, there, was, no, corresponding, japanese, word, nor, anything, close, to, its, meaning, but, when, american, warships, appeared, off, the, coast, of, japan, in, 1853, and, forced, the, japanese, government, to, sign, treaties, demanding, among, other, things, freedom, of, religion, the, country, had, to, contend, with, this, idea, according, to, the, philologist, max, m, ller, in, the, 19th, century, the, root, of, the, english, word, religion, the, latin, religi, was, originally, used, to, mean, only, reverence, for, god, or, the, gods, careful, pondering, of, divine, things, piety, which, cicero, further, derived, to, mean, diligence, m, ller, characterized, many, other, cultures, around, the, world, including, egypt, persia, and, india, as, having, a, similar, power, structure, at, this, point, in, history, what, is, called, ancient, religion, today, they, would, have, only, called, law, scholars, have, failed, to, agree, on, a, definition, of, religion, there, are, however, two, general, definition, systems, the, sociological, functional, and, the, phenomenological, philosophical, the, concept, of, religion, originated, in, the, modern, era, in, the, west, parallel, concepts, are, not, found, in, many, current, and, past, cultures, there, is, no, equivalent, term, for, religion, in, many, languages, scholars, have, found, it, difficult, to, develop, a, consistent, definition, with, some, giving, up, on, the, possibility, of, a, definition, others, argue, that, regardless, of, its, definition, it, is, not, appropriate, to, apply, it, to, non, western, cultures, an, increasing, number, of, scholars, have, expressed, reservations, about, ever, defining, the, essence, of, religion, they, observe, that, the, way, the, concept, today, is, used, is, a, particularly, modern, construct, that, would, not, have, been, understood, through, much, of, history, and, in, many, cultures, outside, the, west, or, even, in, the, west, until, after, the, peace, of, westphalia, the, macmillan, encyclopedia, of, religions, states, the, very, attempt, to, define, religion, to, find, some, distinctive, or, possibly, unique, essence, or, set, of, qualities, that, distinguish, the, religious, from, the, remainder, of, human, life, is, primarily, a, western, concern, the, attempt, is, a, natural, consequence, of, the, western, speculative, intellectualistic, and, scientific, disposition, it, is, also, the, product, of, the, dominant, western, religious, mode, what, is, called, the, judeo, christian, climate, or, more, accurately, the, theistic, inheritance, from, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, theistic, form, of, belief, in, this, tradition, even, when, downgraded, culturally, is, formative, of, the, dichotomous, western, view, of, religion, that, is, the, basic, structure, of, theism, is, essentially, a, distinction, between, a, transcendent, deity, and, all, else, between, the, creator, and, his, creation, between, god, and, man, the, anthropologist, clifford, geertz, defined, religion, as, a, system, of, symbols, which, acts, to, establish, powerful, pervasive, and, long, lasting, moods, and, motivations, in, men, by, formulating, conceptions, of, a, general, order, of, existence, and, clothing, these, conceptions, with, such, an, aura, of, factuality, that, the, moods, and, motivations, seem, uniquely, realistic, alluding, perhaps, to, tylor, s, deeper, motive, geertz, remarked, that, we, have, very, little, idea, of, how, in, empirical, terms, this, particular, miracle, is, accomplished, we, just, know, that, it, is, done, annually, weekly, daily, for, some, people, almost, hourly, and, we, have, an, enormous, ethnographic, literature, to, demonstrate, it, the, theologian, antoine, vergote, took, the, term, supernatural, simply, to, mean, whatever, transcends, the, powers, of, nature, or, human, agency, he, also, emphasized, the, cultural, reality, of, religion, which, he, defined, as, the, entirety, of, the, linguistic, expressions, emotions, and, actions, and, signs, that, refer, to, a, supernatural, being, or, supernatural, beings, peter, mandaville, and, paul, james, intended, to, get, away, from, the, modernist, dualisms, or, dichotomous, understandings, of, immanence, transcendence, spirituality, materialism, and, sacredness, secularity, they, define, religion, as, a, relatively, bounded, system, of, beliefs, symbols, and, practices, that, addresses, the, nature, of, existence, and, in, which, communion, with, others, and, otherness, is, lived, as, if, it, both, takes, in, and, spiritually, transcends, socially, grounded, ontologies, of, time, space, embodiment, and, knowing, according, to, the, macmillan, encyclopedia, of, religions, there, is, an, experiential, aspect, to, religion, which, can, be, found, in, almost, every, culture, almost, every, known, culture, a, depth, dimension, in, cultural, experiences, toward, some, sort, of, ultimacy, and, transcendence, that, will, provide, norms, and, power, for, the, rest, of, life, when, more, or, less, distinct, patterns, of, behavior, are, built, around, this, depth, dimension, in, a, culture, this, structure, constitutes, religion, in, its, historically, recognizable, form, religion, is, the, organization, of, life, around, the, depth, dimensions, of, experience, varied, in, form, completeness, and, clarity, in, accordance, with, the, environing, culture, anthropologists, lyle, steadman, and, craig, t, palmer, emphasized, the, communication, of, supernatural, beliefs, defining, religion, as, the, communicated, acceptance, by, individuals, of, another, individual, s, supernatural, claim, a, claim, whose, accuracy, is, not, verifiable, by, the, senses, friedrich, schleiermacher, in, the, late, 18th, century, defined, religion, as, das, schlechthinnige, abh, ngigkeitsgef, hl, commonly, translated, as, the, feeling, of, absolute, dependence, his, contemporary, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, disagreed, thoroughly, defining, religion, as, the, divine, spirit, becoming, conscious, of, himself, through, the, finite, spirit, edward, burnett, tylor, defined, religion, in, 1871, as, the, belief, in, spiritual, beings, he, argued, that, narrowing, the, definition, to, mean, the, belief, in, a, supreme, deity, or, judgment, after, death, or, idolatry, and, so, on, would, exclude, many, peoples, from, the, category, of, religious, and, thus, has, the, fault, of, identifying, religion, rather, with, particular, developments, than, with, the, deeper, motive, which, underlies, them, he, also, argued, that, the, belief, in, spiritual, beings, exists, in, all, known, societies, in, his, book, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, the, psychologist, william, james, defined, religion, as, the, feelings, acts, and, experiences, of, individual, men, in, their, solitude, so, far, as, they, apprehend, themselves, to, stand, in, relation, to, whatever, they, may, consider, the, divine, by, the, term, divine, james, meant, any, object, that, is, god, like, whether, it, be, a, concrete, deity, or, not, to, which, the, individual, feels, impelled, to, respond, with, solemnity, and, gravity, sociologist, mile, durkheim, in, his, seminal, book, the, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, defined, religion, as, a, unified, system, of, beliefs, and, practices, relative, to, sacred, things, by, sacred, things, he, meant, things, set, apart, and, forbidden, beliefs, and, practices, which, unite, into, one, single, moral, community, called, a, church, all, those, who, adhere, to, them, sacred, things, are, not, however, limited, to, gods, or, spirits, on, the, contrary, a, sacred, thing, can, be, a, rock, a, tree, a, spring, a, pebble, a, piece, of, wood, a, house, in, a, word, anything, can, be, sacred, religious, beliefs, myths, dogmas, and, legends, are, the, representations, that, express, the, nature, of, these, sacred, things, and, the, virtues, and, powers, which, are, attributed, to, them, echoes, of, james, and, durkheim, s, definitions, are, to, be, found, in, the, writings, of, for, example, frederick, ferr, who, defined, religion, as, one, s, way, of, valuing, most, comprehensively, and, intensively, similarly, for, the, theologian, paul, tillich, faith, is, the, state, of, being, ultimately, concerned, which, is, itself, religion, religion, is, the, substance, the, ground, and, the, depth, of, man, s, spiritual, life, when, religion, is, seen, in, terms, of, sacred, divine, intensive, valuing, or, ultimate, concern, then, it, is, possible, to, understand, why, scientific, findings, and, philosophical, criticisms, e, g, those, made, by, richard, dawkins, do, not, necessarily, disturb, its, adherents, the, origin, of, religious, belief, is, an, open, question, with, possible, explanations, including, awareness, of, individual, death, a, sense, of, community, and, dreams, traditionally, faith, in, addition, to, reason, has, been, considered, a, source, of, religious, beliefs, the, interplay, between, faith, and, reason, and, their, use, as, perceived, support, for, religious, beliefs, have, been, a, subject, of, interest, to, philosophers, and, theologians, the, word, myth, has, several, meanings, ancient, polytheistic, religions, such, as, those, of, greece, rome, and, scandinavia, are, usually, categorized, under, the, heading, of, mythology, religions, of, pre, industrial, peoples, or, cultures, in, development, are, similarly, called, myths, in, the, anthropology, of, religion, the, term, myth, can, be, used, pejoratively, by, both, religious, and, non, religious, people, by, defining, another, person, s, religious, stories, and, beliefs, as, mythology, one, implies, that, they, are, less, real, or, true, than, one, s, own, religious, stories, and, beliefs, joseph, campbell, remarked, mythology, is, often, thought, of, as, other, people, s, religions, and, religion, can, be, defined, as, misinterpreted, mythology, in, sociology, however, the, term, myth, has, a, non, pejorative, meaning, there, myth, is, defined, as, a, story, that, is, important, for, the, group, whether, or, not, it, is, objectively, or, provably, true, examples, include, the, resurrection, of, their, real, life, founder, jesus, which, to, christians, explains, the, means, by, which, they, are, freed, from, sin, is, symbolic, of, the, power, of, life, over, death, and, is, also, said, to, be, a, historical, event, but, from, a, mythological, outlook, whether, or, not, the, event, actually, occurred, is, unimportant, instead, the, symbolism, of, the, death, of, an, old, life, and, the, start, of, a, new, life, is, most, significant, religious, believers, may, or, may, not, accept, such, symbolic, interpretations, the, practices, of, a, religion, may, include, rituals, sermons, commemoration, or, veneration, of, a, deity, god, or, goddess, sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary, services, matrimonial, services, meditation, prayer, religious, music, religious, art, sacred, dance, public, service, or, other, aspects, of, human, culture, religions, have, a, societal, basis, either, as, a, living, tradition, which, is, carried, by, lay, participants, or, with, an, organized, clergy, and, a, definition, of, what, constitutes, adherence, or, membership, a, number, of, disciplines, study, the, phenomenon, of, religion, theology, comparative, religion, history, of, religion, evolutionary, origin, of, religions, anthropology, of, religion, psychology, of, religion, including, neuroscience, of, religion, and, evolutionary, psychology, of, religion, law, and, religion, and, sociology, of, religion, daniel, l, pals, mentions, eight, classical, theories, of, religion, focusing, on, various, aspects, of, religion, animism, and, magic, by, e, b, tylor, and, j, g, frazer, the, psycho, analytic, approach, of, sigmund, freud, and, further, mile, durkheim, karl, marx, max, weber, mircea, eliade, e, e, evans, pritchard, and, clifford, geertz, michael, stausberg, gives, an, overview, of, contemporary, theories, of, religion, including, cognitive, and, biological, approaches, sociological, and, anthropological, theories, of, religion, generally, attempt, to, explain, the, origin, and, function, of, religion, these, theories, define, what, they, present, as, universal, characteristics, of, religious, belief, and, practice, the, origin, of, religion, is, uncertain, there, are, a, number, of, theories, regarding, the, subsequent, origins, of, religious, practices, according, to, anthropologists, john, monaghan, and, peter, just, many, of, the, great, world, religions, appear, to, have, begun, as, revitalization, movements, of, some, sort, as, the, vision, of, a, charismatic, prophet, fires, the, imaginations, of, people, seeking, a, more, comprehensive, answer, to, their, problems, than, they, feel, is, provided, by, everyday, beliefs, charismatic, individuals, have, emerged, at, many, times, and, places, in, the, world, it, seems, that, the, key, to, long, term, success, and, many, movements, come, and, go, with, little, long, term, effect, has, relatively, little, to, do, with, the, prophets, who, appear, with, surprising, regularity, but, more, to, do, with, the, development, of, a, group, of, supporters, who, are, able, to, institutionalize, the, movement, the, development, of, religion, has, taken, different, forms, in, different, cultures, some, religions, place, an, emphasis, on, belief, while, others, emphasize, practice, some, religions, focus, on, the, subjective, experience, of, the, religious, individual, while, others, consider, the, activities, of, the, religious, community, to, be, most, important, some, religions, claim, to, be, universal, believing, their, laws, and, cosmology, to, be, binding, for, everyone, while, others, are, intended, to, be, practiced, only, by, a, closely, defined, or, localized, group, in, many, places, religion, has, been, associated, with, public, institutions, such, as, education, hospitals, the, family, government, and, political, hierarchies, anthropologists, john, monoghan, and, peter, just, state, that, it, seems, apparent, that, one, thing, religion, or, belief, helps, us, do, is, deal, with, problems, of, human, life, that, are, significant, persistent, and, intolerable, one, important, way, in, which, religious, beliefs, accomplish, this, is, by, providing, a, set, of, ideas, about, how, and, why, the, world, is, put, together, that, allows, people, to, accommodate, anxieties, and, deal, with, misfortune, while, religion, is, difficult, to, define, one, standard, model, of, religion, used, in, religious, studies, courses, was, proposed, by, clifford, geertz, who, simply, called, it, a, cultural, system, a, critique, of, geertz, s, model, by, talal, asad, categorized, religion, as, an, anthropological, category, richard, niebuhr, s, 1894, 1962, five, fold, classification, of, the, relationship, between, christ, and, culture, however, indicates, that, religion, and, culture, can, be, seen, as, two, separate, systems, though, with, some, interplay, one, modern, academic, theory, of, religion, social, constructionism, says, that, religion, is, a, modern, concept, that, suggests, all, spiritual, practice, and, worship, follows, a, model, similar, to, the, abrahamic, religions, as, an, orientation, system, that, helps, to, interpret, reality, and, define, human, beings, among, the, main, proponents, of, this, theory, of, religion, are, daniel, dubuisson, timothy, fitzgerald, talal, asad, and, jason, nanda, josephson, the, social, constructionists, argue, that, religion, is, a, modern, concept, that, developed, from, christianity, and, was, then, applied, inappropriately, to, non, western, cultures, cognitive, science, of, religion, is, the, study, of, religious, thought, and, behavior, from, the, perspective, of, the, cognitive, and, evolutionary, sciences, the, field, employs, methods, and, theories, from, a, very, broad, range, of, disciplines, including, cognitive, psychology, evolutionary, psychology, cognitive, anthropology, artificial, intelligence, cognitive, neuroscience, neurobiology, zoology, and, ethology, scholars, in, this, field, seek, to, explain, how, human, minds, acquire, generate, and, transmit, religious, thoughts, practices, and, schemas, by, means, of, ordinary, cognitive, capacities, hallucinations, and, delusions, related, to, religious, content, occurs, in, about, 60, of, people, with, schizophrenia, while, this, number, varies, across, cultures, this, had, led, to, theories, about, a, number, of, influential, religious, phenomena, and, possible,

to, explain, respectively, the, mechanisms, of, gravity, and, evolution, religion, does, not, have, a, method, per, se, partly, because, religions, emerge, through, time, from, diverse, cultures, and, it, is, an, attempt, to, find, meaning, in, the, world, and, to, explain, humanity, s, place, in, it, and, relationship, to, it, and, to, any, posited, entities, in, terms, of, christian, theology, and, ultimate, truths, people, rely, on, reason, experience, scripture, and, tradition, to, test, and, gauge, what, they, experience, and, what, they, should, believe, furthermore, religious, models, understanding, and, metaphors, are, also, revisable, as, are, scientific, models, regarding, religion, and, science, albert, einstein, states, 1940, for, science, can, only, ascertain, what, is, but, not, what, should, be, and, outside, of, its, domain, value, judgments, of, all, kinds, remain, necessary, religion, on, the, other, hand, deals, only, with, evaluations, of, human, thought, and, action, it, cannot, justifiably, speak, of, facts, and, relationships, between, facts, now, even, though, the, realms, of, religion, and, science, in, themselves, are, clearly, marked, off, from, each, other, nevertheless, there, exist, between, the, two, strong, reciprocal, relationships, and, dependencies, though, religion, may, be, that, which, determine, the, goals, it, has, nevertheless, learned, from, science, in, the, broadest, sense, what, means, will, contribute, to, the, attainment, of, the, goals, it, has, set, up, many, religions, have, value, frameworks, regarding, personal,

assumed, in, christian, thought, that, morality, is, ultimately, based, in, religion, it, can, also, have, a, secular, basis, the, study, of, religion, and, morality, can, be, contentious, due, to, ethnocentric, views, on, morality, failure, to, distinguish, between, in, group, and, out, group, altruism, and, inconsistent, definitions, of, religiosity, religion, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, political, system, in, many, countries, notably, most, muslim, majority, countries, adopt, various, aspects, of, sharia, the, islamic, law, some, countries, even, define, themselves, in, religious, terms, such, as, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, the, sharia, thus, affects, up, to, 23, of, the, global, population, or, 1, 57, billion, people, who, are, muslims, however, religion, also, affects, political, decisions, in, many, western, countries, for, instance, in, the, united, states, 51, of, voters, would, be, less, likely, to, vote, for, a, presidential, candidate, who, did,

religion, still, has, a, strong, impact, on, politics, given, that, hindu, nationalists, have, been, targeting, minorities, like, the, muslims, and, the, christians, who, historically, belonged, to, the, lower, castes, by, contrast, countries, such, as, china, or, japan, are, largely, secular, and, thus, religion, has, a, much, smaller, impact, on, politics, secularization, is, the, transformation, of, the, politics, of, a, society, from, close, identification, with, a, particular, religion, s, values, and, institutions, toward, nonreligious, values, and, secular, institutions,

defined, religiosity, and, the, wealth, of, nations, in, other, words, the, richer, a, nation, is, the, less, likely, its, inhabitants, to, call, themselves, religious, whatever, this, word, means,

that, protestant, christian, countries, are, wealthier, because, of, their, protestant, work, ethic, according, to, a, study, from, 2015, christians, hold, the, largest, amount, of, wealth, 55, of,

examined, the, association, between, religious, involvement, and, spirituality, and, physical, health, mental, health, health, related, quality, of, life, and, other, health, outcomes, the, authors, reported, that, most, studies, have, shown, that, religious, involvement, and, spirituality, are, associated, with, better, health, outcomes, including, greater, longevity, coping, skills, and, health, related, quality, of, life, even, during, terminal, illness, and, less, anxiety, depression, and, suicide, the, authors, of, a, subsequent, study, concluded, that, the, influence, of, religion, on, health, is, largely, beneficial, based, on, a, review, of, related, literature, according, to, academic, james, w, jones, several, studies, have, discovered, positive, correlations, between, religious, belief, and, practice, and, mental, and, physical, health, and, longevity, an, analysis, of, data, from, the, 1998, us, general, social, survey, whilst, broadly, confirming, that, religious, activity, was, associated, with, better, health, and, well, being, also, suggested, that, the, role, of, different, dimensions, of, spirituality, religiosity, in, health, is, rather, more, complicated, the, results, suggested, that, it, may, not, be, appropriate, to, generalize, findings, about, the, relationship, between, spirituality, religiosity, and, health, from, one, form, of,
