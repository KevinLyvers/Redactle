a, set, of, irreducible, beliefs, the, fundamentals, the, term, fundamentalism, is, generally, regarded, by, scholars, of, religion, as, referring, to, a, largely, modern, religious, phenomenon, which, while, itself, a, reinterpretation, of, religion, as, defined, by, the, parameters, of, modernism, reifies, religion, in, reaction, against, modernist, secularist, liberal, and, ecumenical, tendencies, developing, in, religion, and, society, in, general, that, it, perceives, to, be, foreign, to, a, particular, religious, tradition, depending, upon, the, context, the, label, fundamentalism, can, be, a, pejorative, rather, than, a, neutral, characterization, similar, to, the, ways, that, calling, political, perspectives, right, wing, or, left, wing, can, have, negative, connotations, buddhist, fundamentalism, has, targeted, other, religious, and, ethnic, groups, as, in, myanmar, a, buddhist, dominated, country, myanmar, has, seen, tensions, between, muslim, minorities, and, the, buddhist, majority, especially, during, the, 2013, burma, anti, muslim, riots, possibly, instigated, by, hardline, groups, such, as, the, 969, movement, as, well, as, during,

between, muslim, minorities, and, the, buddhist, majority, especially, during, the, 2014, anti, muslim, riots, in, sri, lanka, and, in, the, course, of, the, 2018, anti, muslim, riots, in, sri, lanka, allegedly, instigated, by, hardline, groups, such, as, the, bodu, bala, sena, historic, and, contemporary, examples, of, buddhist, fundamentalism, occur, in, each, of, the, three, main, branches, of, buddhism, theravada, mahayana, and, vajrayana, in, addition, to, the, above, examples, of, fundamentalism, in, theravada, dominated, societies, the, reification, of, a, protector, deity, dorje, shugden, by, 19th, century, tibetan, lama, pabongkhapa, could, be, seen, as, an, example, of, fundamentalism, in, the, vajrayana, tradition, dorje, shugden, was, a, key, tool, in, pabongkhapa, s, persecution, of, the, flourishing, rim, movement, an, ecumenical, movement, which, fused, the, teachings, of, the, sakya, kagyu, and, nyingma, in, response, to, the, dominance, of, the, gelug, school, while, pabongkhapa, had, an, initially, inclusive, view, early, in, his, life, he, received, a, number, of, signs, that, he, had, displeased, dorje, shugden, by, receiving, teachings, from, non, gelug, schools, and, thus, initiated, a, revival, movement, that, opposed, the, mixing, of, non, gelug, practices, by, gelug, practitioners, the, main, function, of, the, deity, was, presented, as, the, protection, of, the, ge, luk, tradition, through, violent, means, even, including, the, killing, of, its, enemies, crucially, however, these, enemies, of, the, gelug, refers, less, to, the, members, of, rival, schools, than, to, members, of, the, gelug, tradition, who, mix, dzong, ka, ba, s, tradition, with, elements, coming, from, other, traditions, particularly, the, nying, ma, dzok, chen, in, japan, a, prominent, example, has, been, the, practice, among, some, members, of, the, mahayana, nichiren, sect, of, shakubuku, a, method, of, proselytizing, which, involves, the, strident, condemnation, of, other, sects, as, deficient, or, evil, george, marsden, has, defined, christian, fundamentalism, as, the, demand, for, strict, adherence, to, certain, theological, doctrines, in, opposition, to, modernist, theology, its, supporters, originally, coined, the, term, in, order, to, describe, what, they, claimed, were, five, specific, classic, theological, beliefs, of, christianity, and, the, coinage, of, the, term, led, to, the, development, of, a, christian, fundamentalist, movement, within, the, protestant, community, of, the, united, states, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, fundamentalism, as, a, movement, arose, in, the, united, states, starting, among, conservative, presbyterian, theologians, at, princeton, theological, seminary, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, soon, spread, to, conservatives, among, the, baptists, and, other, denominations, around, 1910, to, 1920, the, movement, s, purpose, was, to, reaffirm, key, theological, tenets, and, defend, them, against, the, challenges, of, liberal, theology, and, higher, criticism, the, concept, of, fundamentalism, has, roots, in, the, niagara, bible, conferences, which, were, held, annually, between, 1878, and, 1897, during, those, conferences, the, tenets, widely, considered, to, be, fundamental, christian, belief, were, identified, fundamentalism, was, prefigured, by, the, fundamentals, a, testimony, to, the, truth, a, collection, of, twelve, pamphlets, published, between, 1910, and, 1915, by, brothers, milton, and, lyman, stewart, it, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, foundation, of, modern, christian, fundamentalism, in, 1910, the, general, assembly, of, the, presbyterian, church, identified, what, became, known, as, the, five, fundamentals, in, 1920, the, word, fundamentalist, was, first, used, in, print, by, curtis, lee, laws, editor, of, the, watchman, examiner, a, baptist, newspaper, laws, proposed, that, those, christians, who, were, fighting, for, the, fundamentals, of, the, faith, should, be, called, fundamentalists, theological, conservatives, who, rallied, around, the, five, fundamentals, came, to, be, known, as, fundamentalists, they, rejected, the, existence, of, commonalities, with, theologically, related, religious, traditions, such, as, the, grouping, of, christianity, islam, and, judaism, into, one, abrahamic, family, of, religions, by, contrast, while, evangelical, groups, such, as, the, billy, graham, evangelistic, association, typically, agree, with, the, fundamentals, as, they, are, expressed, in, the, fundamentals, they, are, often, willing, to, participate, in, events, with, religious, groups, that, do, not, hold, to, the, essential, doctrines, the, existence, of, fundamentalism, in, hinduism, is, a, complex, and, contradictory, phenomenon, while, some, would, argue, that, certain, aspects, of, gaudiya, vaishnavism, manifest, fundamentalist, tendencies, these, tendencies, are, more, clearly, displayed, in, hindutva, the, predominant, form, of, hindu, nationalism, in, india, today, and, an, increasingly, powerful, and, influential, voice, within, the, religion, hinduism, includes, a, diversity, of, ideas, on, spirituality, and, traditions, but, has, no, ecclesiastical, order, no, unquestionable, religious, authorities, no, governing, body, no, prophet, s, nor, any, binding, holy, book, hindus, can, choose, to, be, polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or, humanist, according, to, doniger, ideas, about, all, the, major, issues, of, faith, and, lifestyle, vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief, in, rebirth, even, caste, are, subjects, of, debate, not, dogma, some, would, argue, that, because, of, the, wide, range, of, traditions, and, ideas, covered, by, the, term, hinduism, a, lack, of, theological, fundamentals, means, that, a, dogmatic, religious, fundamentalism, per, se, is, hard, to, find, others, point, to, the, recent, rise, of, hindu, nationalism, in, india, as, evidence, to, the, contrary, the, religion, defies, our, desire, to, define, and, categorize, it, in, india, the, term, dharma, is, preferred, which, is, broader, than, the, western, term, religion, hence, certain, scholars, argue, that, hinduism, lacks, dogma, and, thus, a, specific, notion, of, fundamentalism, while, other, scholars, identify, several, politically, active, hindu, movements, as, part, of, a, hindu, fundamentalist, family, fundamentalism, within, islam, goes, back, to, the, early, history, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, to, the, time, of, the, kharijites, from, their, essentially, political, position, they, developed, extreme, doctrines, that, set, them, apart, from, both, mainstream, shia, and, sunni, muslims, the, kharijites, were, particularly, noted, for, adopting, a, radical, approach, to, takfir, whereby, they, declared, other, muslims, to, be, unbelievers, and, therefore, deemed, them, worthy, of, death, the, shia, and, sunni, religious, conflicts, since, the, 7th, century, created, an, opening, for, radical, ideologues, such, as, ali, shariati, 1933, 77, to, merge, social, revolution, with, islamic, fundamentalism, as, exemplified, by, the, iranian, revolution, in, 1979, islamic, fundamentalism, has, appeared, in, many, countries, the, salafi, wahhabi, version, is, promoted, worldwide, and, financed, by, saudi, arabia, qatar, and, pakistan, the, iran, hostage, crisis, of, 1979, 80, marked, a, major, turning, point, in, the, use, of, the, term, fundamentalism, the, media, in, an, attempt, to, explain, the, ideology, of, ayatollah, khomeini, and, the, iranian, revolution, to, a, western, audience, described, it, as, a, fundamentalist, version, of, islam, by, way, of, analogy, to, the, christian, fundamentalist, movement, in, the, u, s, thus, was, born, the, term, islamic, fundamentalist, which, became, a, common, use, of, the, term, in, following, years, jewish, fundamentalism, has, been, used, to, characterize, militant, religious, zionism, and, both, ashkenazi, and, sephardic, versions, of, haredi, judaism, ian, s, lustik, has, characterized, jewish, fundamentalism, as, an, ultranationalist, eschatologically, based, irredentist, ideology, the, term, new, atheism, describes, the, positions, of, some, atheist, academics, writers, scientists, and, philosophers, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, critics, have, described, new, atheism, as, secular, fundamentalism, in, modern, politics, fundamentalism, has, been, associated, with, right, wing, conservative, ideology, especially, social, conservatism, social, conservatives, often, support, policies, in, line, with, religious, fundamentalism, such, as, support, for, school, prayer, and, opposition, to, lgbt, rights, and, abortion, conversely, secularism, has, been, associated, with, left, wing, or, liberal, ideology, as, it, takes, the, opposite, stance, to, said, policies, political, usage, of, the, term, fundamentalism, has, been, criticized, it, has, been, used, by, political, groups, to, berate, opponents, using, the, term, flexibly, depending, on, their, political, interests, according, to, judith, nagata, a, professor, of, asia, research, institute, in, the, national, university, of, singapore, the, afghan, mujahiddin, locked, in, combat, with, the, soviet, enemy, in, the, 1980s, could, be, praised, as, freedom, fighters, by, their, american, backers, at, the, time, while, the, present, taliban, viewed, among, other, things, as, protectors, of, american, enemy, osama, bin, laden, are, unequivocally, fundamentalist, fundamentalist, has, been, used, pejoratively, to, refer, to, philosophies, perceived, as, literal, minded, or, carrying, a, pretense, of, being, the, sole, source, of, objective, truth, regardless, of, whether, it, is, usually, called, a, religion, for, instance, the, archbishop, of, wales, has, criticized, atheistic, fundamentalism, broadly, and, said, any, kind, of, fundamentalism, be, it, biblical, atheistic, or, islamic, is, dangerous, he, also, said, the, new, fundamentalism, of, our, age, leads, to, the, language, of, expulsion, and, exclusivity, of, extremism, and, polarisation, and, the, claim, that, because, god, is, on, our, side, he, is, not, on, yours, he, claimed, it, led, to, situations, such, as, councils, calling, christmas, winterval, schools, refusing, to, put, on, nativity, plays, and, crosses, being, removed, from, chapels, others, have, countered, that, some, of, these, attacks, on, christmas, are, urban, legends, not, all, schools, do, nativity, plays, because, they, choose, to, perform, other, traditional, plays, like, a, christmas, carol, or, the, snow, queen, and, because, of, rising, tensions, between, various, religions, opening, up, public, spaces, to, alternate, displays, rather, than, the, nativity, scene, is, an, attempt, to, keep, government, religion, neutral, in, the, new, inquisition, robert, anton, wilson, lampoons, the, members, of, skeptical, organizations, such, as, the, committee, for, the, scientific, investigation, of, claims, of, the, paranormal, as, fundamentalist, materialists, alleging, that, they, dogmatically, dismiss, any, evidence, that, conflicts, with, materialism, as, hallucination, or, fraud, in, france, during,

to, imply, exaggerated, religious, like, faith, in, the, ability, of, unfettered, laissez, faire, or, free, market, capitalist, economic, views, or, policies, to, solve, economic, and, social, problems, according, to, economist, john, quiggin, the, standard, features, of, economic, fundamentalist, rhetoric, are, dogmatic, assertions, and, the, claim, that, anyone, who, holds, contrary, views, is, not, a, real, economist, retired, professor, in, religious, studies, roderick, hindery, lists, positive, qualities, attributed, to, political, economic, or, other, forms, of, cultural,

attitudes, occasionally, elitist, and, pessimistic, perspectives, and, in, some, cases, literalism, a, criticism, by, elliot, n, dorff, in, order, to, carry, out, the, fundamentalist, program, in, practice, one, would, need, a, perfect, understanding, of, the, ancient, language, of, the, original, text, if, indeed, the, true, text, can, be, discerned, from, among, variants, furthermore, human, beings, are, the, ones, who, transmit, this, understanding, between, generations, even, if, one, wanted, to, follow, the, literal, word, of, god, the, need, for, people, first, to, understand, that, word, necessitates, human, interpretation, through, that, process, human, fallibility, is, inextricably, mixed, into, the, very, meaning, of, the, divine, word, as, a, result, it, is, impossible, to, follow, the, indisputable, word, of, god, one, can, only, achieve, a, human, understanding, of, god, s, will, howard, thurman, was, interviewed, in, the, late, 1970s, for, a, bbc, feature, on,

reduce, the, conglomerates, of, experience, to, units, of, comprehension, which, we, call, principles, or, ideologies, or, concepts, religious, experience, is, dynamic, fluid, effervescent, yeasty, but, the, mind, can, t, handle, these, so, it, has, to, imprison, religious, experience, in, some, way, get, it, bottled, up, then, when, the, experience, quiets, down, the, mind, draws, a, bead, on, it, and, extracts, concepts, notions, dogmas, so, that, religious, experience, can, make, sense, to, the, mind, meanwhile, religious, experience, goes, on, experiencing, so, that, by, the, time, i,

for, any, group, that, does, not, apply, the, term, to, itself, many, scholars, have, adopted, a, similar, position, other, scholars, however, use, the, term, in, the, broader, descriptive, sense, to, refer, to, various, groups, in, various, religious, traditions, including, those, groups, that, would, object, to, being, classified, as, fundamentalists, such, as, in, the, fundamentalism, project,
