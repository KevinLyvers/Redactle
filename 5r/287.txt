post, vedic, sanskrit, texts, that, document, the, transition, from, the, archaic, ritualism, of, the, veda, into, new, religious, ideas, and, institutions, and, the, emergence, of, the, central, religious, concepts, of, hinduism, they, are, the, most, recent, addition, to, the, vedas, the, oldest, scriptures, of, hinduism, and, deal, with, meditation, philosophy, consciousness, and, ontological, knowledge, earlier, parts, of, the, vedas, dealt, with, mantras, benedictions, rituals, ceremonies, and, sacrifices, while, among, the, most, important, literature, in, the, history, of, indian, religions, and, culture, the, upanishads, document, a, wide, variety, of, rites, incantations, and, esoteric, knowledge, departing, from, vedic, ritualism, and, interpreted, in, various, ways, in, the, later, commentarial, traditions, the, upanishads, are, widely, known, and, their, diverse, ideas, interpreted, in, various, ways, informed, later, traditions, of, hinduism, the, central, concern, of, all, upanishads, is, to, discover, the, relations, between, ritual, cosmic, realities, including, gods, and, the, human, body, person, postulating, tman, and, brahman, as, the, summit, of, the, hierarchically, arranged, and, interconnected, universe, but, various, ideas, about, the, relation, between, atman, and, brahman, can, be, found, around, 108, upanishads, are, known, of, which, the, first, dozen, or, so, are, the, oldest, and, most, important, and, are, referred, to, as, the, principal, or, main, mukhya, upanishads, the, mukhya, upanishads, are, found, mostly, in, the, concluding, part, of, the, brahmanas, and, aranyakas, and, were, for, centuries, memorized, by, each, generation, and, passed, down, orally, the, mukhya, upanishads, predate, the, common, era, but, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, on, their, date, or, even, on, which, ones, are, pre, or, post, buddhist, the, brhadaranyaka, is, seen, as, particularly, ancient, by, modern, scholars, of, the, remainder, 95, upanishads, are, part, of, the, muktik, canon, composed, from, about, the, last, centuries, of, 1st, millennium, bce, through, about, 15th, century, ce, new, upanishads, beyond, the, 108, in, the, muktika, canon, continued, to, be, composed, through, the, early, modern, and, modern, era, though, often, dealing, with, subjects, that, are, unconnected, to, the, vedas, the, mukhya, upanishads, along, with, the, bhagavad, gita, and, the, brahmasutra, known, collectively, as, the, prasthanatrayi, are, interpreted, in, divergent, ways, in, the, several, later, schools, of, vedanta, translations, of, the, upanishads, in, the, early, 19th, century, started, to, attract, attention, from, a, western, audience, german, philosopher, arthur, schopenhauer, was, deeply, impressed, by, the, upanishads, and, called, them, the, most, profitable, and, elevating, reading, which, is, possible, in, the, world, modern, era, indologists, have, discussed, the, similarities, between, the, fundamental, concepts, in, the, upanishads, and, the, works, of, major, western, philosophers, the, sanskrit, term, upani, ad, originally, meant, connection, or, equivalence, but, came, to, be, understood, as, sitting, near, a, teacher, from, upa, by, and, ni, ad, sit, down, sitting, down, near, referring, to, the, student, sitting, down, near, the, teacher, while, receiving, spiritual, knowledge, gurumukh, other, dictionary, meanings, include, esoteric, doctrine, and, secret, doctrine, monier, williams, sanskrit, dictionary, notes, according, to, native, authorities, upanishad, means, setting, to, rest, ignorance, by, revealing, the, knowledge, of, the, supreme, spirit, adi, shankaracharya, explains, in, his, commentary, on, the, ka, ha, and, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, that, the, word, means, tmavidy, that, is, knowledge, of, the, self, or, brahmavidy, knowledge, of, brahman, the, word, appears, in, the, verses, of, many, upanishads, such, as, the, fourth, verse, of, the, 13th, volume, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, chandogya, upanishad, max, m, ller, as, well, as, paul, deussen, translate, the, word, upanishad, in, these, verses, as, secret, doctrine, robert, hume, translates, it, as, mystic, meaning, while, patrick, olivelle, translates, it, as, hidden, connections, the, authorship, of, most, upanishads, is, unknown, radhakrishnan, states, almost, all, the, early, literature, of, india, was, anonymous, we, do, not, know, the, names, of, the, authors, of, the, upanishads, the, ancient, upanishads, are, embedded, in, the, vedas, the, oldest, of, hinduism, s, religious, scriptures, which, some, traditionally, consider, to, be, apauru, eya, which, means, not, of, a, man, superhuman, and, impersonal, authorless, the, vedic, texts, assert, that, they, were, skillfully, created, by, rishis, sages, after, inspired, creativity, just, as, a, carpenter, builds, a, chariot, the, various, philosophical, theories, in, the, early, upanishads, have, been, attributed, to, famous, sages, such, as, yajnavalkya, uddalaka, aruni, shvetaketu, shandilya, aitareya, balaki, pippalada, and, sanatkumara, women, such, as, maitreyi, and, gargi, participate, in, the, dialogues, and, are, also, credited, in, the, early, upanishads, there, are, some, exceptions, to, the, anonymous, tradition, of, the, upanishads, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, for, example, includes, closing, credits, to, sage, shvetashvatara, and, he, is, considered, the, author, of, the, upanishad, many, scholars, believe, that, early, upanishads, were, interpolated, and, expanded, over, time, there, are, differences, within, manuscripts, of, the, same, upanishad, discovered, in, different, parts, of, south, asia, differences, in, non, sanskrit, version, of, the, texts, that, have, survived, and, differences, within, each, text, in, terms, of, meter, style, grammar, and, structure, the, existing, texts, are, believed, to, be, the, work, of, many, authors, scholars, are, uncertain, about, when, the, upanishads, were, composed, the, chronology, of, the, early, upanishads, is, difficult, to, resolve, states, philosopher, and, sanskritist, stephen, phillips, because, all, opinions, rest, on, scanty, evidence, and, analysis, of, archaism, style, and, repetitions, across, texts, and, are, driven, by, assumptions, about, likely, evolution, of, ideas, and, presumptions, about, which, philosophy, might, have, influenced, which, other, indian, philosophies, indologist, patrick, olivelle, says, that, in, spite, of, claims, made, by, some, in, reality, any, dating, of, these, documents, that, attempts, a, precision, closer, than, a, few, centuries, is, as, stable, as, a, house, of, cards, some, scholars, have, tried, to, analyse, similarities, between, hindu, upanishads, and, buddhist, literature, to, establish, chronology, for, the, upanishads, precise, dates, are, impossible, and, most, scholars, give, only, broad, ranges, encompassing, various, centuries, gavin, flood, states, that, the, upanisads, are, not, a, homogeneous, group, of, texts, even, the, older, texts, were, composed, over, a, wide, expanse, of, time, from, about, 600, to, 300, bce, stephen, phillips, places, the, early, or, principal, upanishads, in, the, 800, to, 300, bce, range, patrick, olivelle, a, sanskrit, philologist, and, indologist, gives, the, following, chronology, for, the, early, upanishads, also, called, the, principal, upanishads, meanwhile, the, indologist, johannes, bronkhorst, argues, for, a, later, date, for, the, upanishads, than, has, generally, been, accepted, bronkhorst, places, even, the, oldest, of, the, upanishads, such, as, the, brhadaranyaka, as, possibly, still, being, composed, at, a, date, close, to, katyayana, and, pata, jali, i, e, c, 2nd, century, bce, the, later, upanishads, numbering, about, 95, also, called, minor, upanishads, are, dated, from, the, late, 1st, millennium, bce, to, mid, 2nd, millennium, ce, gavin, flood, dates, many, of, the, twenty, yoga, upanishads, to, be, probably, from, the, 100, bce, to, 300, ce, period, patrick, olivelle, and, other, scholars, date, seven, of, the, twenty, sannyasa, upanishads, to, likely, have, been, complete, sometime, between, the, last, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, to, 300, ce, about, half, of, the, sannyasa, upanishads, were, likely, composed, in, 14th, to, 15th, century, ce, the, general, area, of, the, composition, of, the, early, upanishads, is, considered, as, northern, india, the, region, is, bounded, on, the, west, by, the, upper, indus, valley, on, the, east, by, lower, ganges, region, on, the, north, by, the, himalayan, foothills, and, on, the, south, by, the, vindhya, mountain, range, scholars, are, reasonably, sure, that, the, early, upanishads, were, produced, at, the, geographical, center, of, ancient, brahmanism, kuru, panchala, and, kosala, videha, a, frontier, region, of, brahmanism, together, with, the, areas, immediately, to, the, south, and, west, of, these, this, region, covers, modern, bihar, nepal, uttar, pradesh, uttarakhand, himachal, pradesh, haryana, eastern, rajasthan, and, northern, madhya, pradesh, while, significant, attempts, have, been, made, recently, to, identify, the, exact, locations, of, the, individual, upanishads, the, results, are, tentative, witzel, identifies, the, center, of, activity, in, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, as, the, area, of, videha, whose, king, janaka, features, prominently, in, the, upanishad, the, chandogya, upanishad, was, probably, composed, in, a, more, western, than, eastern, location, in, the, indian, subcontinent, possibly, somewhere, in, the, western, region, of, the, kuru, panchala, country, compared, to, the, principal, upanishads, the, new, upanishads, recorded, in, the, muktik, belong, to, an, entirely, different, region, probably, southern, india, and, are, considerably, relatively, recent, in, the, fourth, chapter, of, the, kaushitaki, upanishad, a, location, named, kashi, modern, varanasi, is, mentioned, there, are, more, than, 200, known, upanishads, one, of, which, the, muktik, upanishad, predates, 1656, ce, and, contains, a, list, of, 108, canonical, upanishads, including, itself, as, the, last, these, are, further, divided, into, upanishads, associated, with, shaktism, goddess, shakti, sannyasa, renunciation, monastic, life, shaivism, god, shiva, vaishnavism, god, vishnu, yoga, and, s, m, nya, general, sometimes, referred, to, as, samanya, vedanta, some, of, the, upanishads, are, categorized, as, sectarian, since, they, present, their, ideas, through, a, particular, god, or, goddess, of, a, specific, hindu, tradition, such, as, vishnu, shiva, shakti, or, a, combination, of, these, such, as, the, skanda, upanishad, these, traditions, sought, to, link, their, texts, as, vedic, by, asserting, their, texts, to, be, an, upanishad, thereby, a, ruti, most, of, these, sectarian, upanishads, for, example, the, rudrahridaya, upanishad, and, the, mahanarayana, upanishad, assert, that, all, the, hindu, gods, and, goddesses, are, the, same, all, an, aspect, and, manifestation, of, brahman, the, vedic, concept, for, metaphysical, ultimate, reality, before, and, after, the, creation, of, the, universe, the, principal, upanishads, also, known, as, the, mukhya, upanishads, can, be, grouped, into, periods, of, the, early, periods, are, the, brihadaranyaka, and, the, chandogya, the, oldest, the, aitareya, kau, taki, and, taittir, ya, upanishads, may, date, to, as, early, as, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bce, while, the, remnant, date, from, between, roughly, the, 4th, to, 1st, centuries, bce, roughly, contemporary, with, the, earliest, portions, of, the, sanskrit, epics, one, chronology, assumes, that, the, aitareya, taittiriya, kausitaki, mundaka, prasna, and, katha, upanishads, has, buddha, s, influence, and, is, consequently, placed, after, the, 5th, century, bce, while, another, proposal, questions, this, assumption, and, dates, it, independent, of, buddha, s, date, of, birth, the, kena, mandukya, and, isa, upanishads, are, typically, placed, after, these, principal, upanishads, but, other, scholars, date, these, differently, not, much, is, known, about, the, authors, except, for, those, like, yajnavalkayva, and, uddalaka, mentioned, in, the, texts, a, few, women, discussants, such, as, gargi, and, maitreyi, the, wife, of, yajnavalkayva, also, feature, occasionally, each, of, the, principal, upanishads, can, be, associated, with, one, of, the, schools, of, exegesis, of, the, four, vedas, shakhas, many, shakhas, are, said, to, have, existed, of, which, only, a, few, remain, the, new, upanishads, often, have, little, relation, to, the, vedic, corpus, and, have, not, been, cited, or, commented, upon, by, any, great, vedanta, philosopher, their, language, differs, from, that, of, the, classic, upanishads, being, less, subtle, and, more, formalized, as, a, result, they, are, not, difficult, to, comprehend, for, the, modern, reader, there, is, no, fixed, list, of, the, upanishads, as, newer, ones, beyond, the, muktika, anthology, of, 108, upanishads, have, continued, to, be, discovered, and, composed, in, 1908, for, example, four, previously, unknown, upanishads, were, discovered, in, newly, found, manuscripts, and, these, were, named, bashkala, chhagaleya, arsheya, and, saunaka, by, friedrich, schrader, who, attributed, them, to, the, first, prose, period, of, the, upanishads, the, text, of, three, of, them, namely, the, chhagaleya, arsheya, and, saunaka, were, incomplete, and, inconsistent, likely, poorly, maintained, or, corrupted, ancient, upanishads, have, long, enjoyed, a, revered, position, in, hindu, traditions, and, authors, of, numerous, sectarian, texts, have, tried, to, benefit, from, this, reputation, by, naming, their, texts, as, upanishads, these, new, upanishads, number, in, the, hundreds, cover, diverse, range, of, topics, from, physiology, to, renunciation, to, sectarian, theories, they, were, composed, between, the, last, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, through, the, early, modern, era, 1600, ce, while, over, two, dozen, of, the, minor, upanishads, are, dated, to, pre, 3rd, century, ce, many, of, these, new, texts, under, the, title, of, upanishads, originated, in, the, first, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, ce, they, are, not, vedic, texts, and, some, do, not, deal, with, themes, found, in, the, vedic, upanishads, the, main, shakta, upanishads, for, example, mostly, discuss, doctrinal, and, interpretative, differences, between, the, two, principal, sects, of, a, major, tantric, form, of, shaktism, called, shri, vidya, upasana, the, many, extant, lists, of, authentic, shakta, upani, ads, vary, reflecting, the, sect, of, their, compilers, so, that, they, yield, no, evidence, of, their, location, in, tantric, tradition, impeding, correct, interpretation, the, tantra, content, of, these, texts, also, weaken, its, identity, as, an, upani, ad, for, non, tantrikas, sectarian, texts, such, as, these, do, not, enjoy, status, as, shruti, and, thus, the, authority, of, the, new, upanishads, as, scripture, is, not, accepted, in, hinduism, all, upanishads, are, associated, with, one, of, the, four, vedas, rigveda, samaveda, yajurveda, there, are, two, primary, versions, or, samhitas, of, the, yajurveda, shukla, yajurveda, krishna, yajurveda, and, atharvaveda, during, the, modern, era, the, ancient, upanishads, that, were, embedded, texts, in, the, vedas, were, detached, from, the, brahmana, and, aranyaka, layers, of, vedic, text, compiled, into, separate, texts, and, these, were, then, gathered, into, anthologies, of, the, upanishads, these, lists, associated, each, upanishad, with, one, of, the, four, vedas, many, such, lists, exist, but, they, are, inconsistent, across, india, in, terms, of, which, upanishads, are, included, and, how, the, newer, upanishads, are, assigned, to, the, ancient, vedas, in, south, india, the, collected, list, based, on, muktika, upanishad, and, published, in, telugu, language, became, the, most, common, by, the, 19th, century, and, this, is, a, list, of, 108, upanishads, in, north, india, a, list, of, 52, upanishads, has, been, most, common, the, muktik, upanishad, s, list, of, 108, upanishads, groups, the, first, 13, as, mukhya, 21, as, s, m, nya, ved, nta, 20, as, sanny, sa, 14, as, vaishnava, 12, as, shaiva, 8, as, shakta, and, 20, as, yoga, the, 108, upanishads, as, recorded, in, the, muktik, are, shown, in, the, table, below, the, mukhya, upanishads, are, the, most, important, and, highlighted, the, central, concern, of, all, upanishads, is, to, discover, the, relations, between, ritual, cosmic, realities, including, gods, and, the, human, body, person, postulating, tman, and, brahman, as, the, summit, of, the, hierarchically, arranged, and, interconnected, universe, but, various, ideas, about, the, relation, between, atman, and, brahman, can, be, found, the, upanishads, reflect, a, pluralism, of, worldviews, while, some, upanishads, have, been, deemed, monistic, others, including, the, katha, upanishad, are, dualistic, the, maitri, is, one, of, the, upanishads, that, inclines, more, toward, dualism, thus, grounding, classical, samkhya, and, yoga, schools, of, hinduism, in, contrast, to, the, non, dualistic, upanishads, at, the, foundation, of, its, vedanta, school, they, contain, a, plurality, of, ideas, the, upanishads, include, sections, on, philosophical, theories, that, have, been, at, the, foundation, of, indian, traditions, for, example, the, chandogya, upanishad, includes, one, of, the, earliest, known, declarations, of, ahimsa, non, violence, as, an, ethical, precept, discussion, of, other, ethical, premises, such, as, damah, temperance, self, restraint, satya, truthfulness, d, na, charity, rjava, non, hypocrisy, daya, compassion, and, others, are, found, in, the, oldest, upanishads, and, many, later, upanishads, similarly, the, karma, doctrine, is, presented, in, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, which, is, the, oldest, upanishad, while, the, hymns, of, the, vedas, emphasize, rituals, and, the, brahmanas, serve, as, a, liturgical, manual, for, those, vedic, rituals, the, spirit, of, the, upanishads, is, inherently, opposed, to, ritual, the, older, upanishads, launch, attacks, of, increasing, intensity, on, the, ritual, anyone, who, worships, a, divinity, other, than, the, self, is, called, a, domestic, animal, of, the, gods, in, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, the, ch, ndogya, upanishad, parodies, those, who, indulge, in, the, acts, of, sacrifice, by, comparing, them, with, a, procession, of, dogs, chanting, om, let, s, eat, om, let, s, drink, the, kaushitaki, upanishad, asserts, that, external, rituals, such, as, agnihotram, offered, in, the, morning, and, in, the, evening, must, be, replaced, with, inner, agnihotram, the, ritual, of, introspection, and, that, not, rituals, but, knowledge, should, be, one, s, pursuit, the, mundaka, upanishad, declares, how, man, has, been, called, upon, promised, benefits, for, scared, unto, and, misled, into, performing, sacrifices, oblations, and, pious, works, mundaka, thereafter, asserts, this, is, foolish, and, frail, by, those, who, encourage, it, and, those, who, follow, it, because, it, makes, no, difference, to, man, s, current, life, and, after, life, it, is, like, blind, men, leading, the, blind, it, is, a, mark, of, conceit, and, vain, knowledge, ignorant, inertia, like, that, of, children, a, futile, useless, practice, the, maitri, upanishad, states, the, performance, of, all, the, sacrifices, described, in, the, maitrayana, brahmana, is, to, lead, up, in, the, end, to, a, knowledge, of, brahman, to, prepare, a, man, for, meditation, therefore, let, such, man, after, he, has, laid, those, fires, meditate, on, the, self, to, become, complete, and, perfect, but, who, is, to, be, meditated, on, the, opposition, to, the, ritual, is, not, explicit, in, the, oldest, upanishads, on, occasions, the, upanishads, extend, the, task, of, the, aranyakas, by, making, the, ritual, allegorical, and, giving, it, a, philosophical, meaning, for, example, the, brihadaranyaka, interprets, the, practice, of, horse, sacrifice, or, ashvamedha, allegorically, it, states, that, the, over, lordship, of, the, earth, may, be, acquired, by, sacrificing, a, horse, it, then, goes, on, to, say, that, spiritual, autonomy, can, only, be, achieved, by, renouncing, the, universe, which, is, conceived, in, the, image, of, a, horse, in, similar, fashion, vedic, gods, such, as, the, agni, aditya, indra, rudra, visnu, brahma, and, others, become, equated, in, the, upanishads, to, the, supreme, immortal, and, incorporeal, brahman, atman, of, the, upanishads, god, becomes, synonymous, with, self, and, is, declared, to, be, everywhere, inmost, being, of, each, human, being, and, within, every, living, creature, the, one, reality, or, ekam, sat, of, the, vedas, becomes, the, ekam, eva, advitiyam, or, the, one, and, only, and, sans, a, second, in, the, upanishads, brahman, atman, and, self, realization, develops, in, the, upanishad, as, the, means, to, moksha, liberation, freedom, in, this, life, or, after, life, according, to, jayatilleke, the, thinkers, of, upanishadic, texts, can, be, grouped, into, two, categories, one, group, which, includes, early, upanishads, along, with, some, middle, and, late, upanishads, were, composed, by, metaphysicians, who, used, rational, arguments, and, empirical, experience, to, formulate, their, speculations, and, philosophical, premises, the, second, group, includes, many, middle, and, later, upanishads, where, their, authors, professed, theories, based, on, yoga, and, personal, experiences, yoga, philosophy, and, practice, adds, jayatilleke, is, not, entirely, absent, in, the, early, upanishads, the, development, of, thought, in, these, upanishadic, theories, contrasted, with, buddhism, since, the, upanishadic, inquiry, fails, to, find, an, empirical, correlate, of, the, assumed, atman, but, nevertheless, assumes, its, existence, consciousness, as, an, eternal, self, the, buddhist, inquiry, is, satisfied, with, the, empirical, investigation, which, shows, that, no, such, atman, exists, because, there, is, no, evidence, states, jayatilleke, the, upanishads, postulate, tman, and, brahman, as, the, summit, of, the, hierarchically, arranged, and, interconnected, universe, both, have, multiple, meanings, and, various, ideas, about, the, relation, between, atman, and, brahman, can, be, found, atman, has, a, wide, range, of, lexical, meanings, including, breath, spirit, and, body, in, the, upanishads, it, refers, to, the, body, but, also, to, the, essence, of, the, concrete, physical, human, body, an, essence, a, life, force, consciousness, or, ultimate, reality, the, ch, ndogya, upani, had, 6, 1, 16, offers, an, organic, understanding, of, tman, characterizing, the, self, in, terms, of, the, life, force, that, animates, all, living, beings, while, the, b, had, ra, yaka, upani, had, characterizes, tman, more, in, terms, of, consciousness, than, as, a, life, giving, essence, brahman, may, refer, to, a, formulation, of, truth, but, also, to, the, ultimate, and, basic, essence, of, the, cosmos, standing, at, the, summit, of, the, hierarchical, scheme, or, at, the, bottom, as, the, ultimate, foundation, of, all, things, brahman, is, beyond, the, reach, of, human, perception, and, thought, atman, likewise, has, multiple, meanings, one, of, them, being, self, the, inner, essence, of, a, human, body, person, various, ideas, about, the, relation, between, atman, and, brahman, can, be, found, two, distinct, somewhat, divergent, themes, stand, out, older, upanishads, state, that, atman, is, part, of, brahman, but, not, identical, while, younger, upanishads, state, that, brahman, highest, reality, universal, principle, being, consciousness, bliss, is, identical, with, atman, the, brahmasutra, by, badarayana, c, 100, bce, synthesized, and, unified, these, somewhat, conflicting, theories, according, to, nakamura, the, brahmasutras, see, atman, and, brahman, as, both, different, and, not, different, a, point, of, view, which, came, to, be, called, bhedabheda, in, later, times, according, to, koller, the, brahmasutras, state, that, atman, and, brahman, are, different, in, some, respects, particularly, during, the, state, of, ignorance, but, at, the, deepest, level, and, in, the, state, of, self, realization, atman, and, brahman, are, identical, non, different, this, ancient, debate, flowered, into, various, dual, non, dual, theories, in, hinduism, two, different, types, of, the, non, dual, brahman, atman, are, presented, in, the, upanishads, according, to, mahadevan, the, one, in, which, the, non, dual, brahman, atman, is, the, all, inclusive, ground, of, the, universe, and, another, in, which, empirical, changing, reality, is, an, appearance, maya, the, upanishads, describe, the, universe, and, the, human, experience, as, an, interplay, of, purusha, the, eternal, unchanging, principles, consciousness, and, prak, ti, the, temporary, changing, material, world, nature, the, former, manifests, itself, as, tman, soul, self, and, the, latter, as, m, y, the, upanishads, refer, to, the, knowledge, of, atman, as, true, knowledge, vidya, and, the, knowledge, of, maya, as, not, true, knowledge, avidya, nescience, lack, of, awareness, lack, of, true, knowledge, hendrick, vroom, explains, the, term, maya, has, been, translated, as, illusion, but, then, it, does, not, concern, normal, illusion, here, illusion, does, not, mean, that, the, world, is, not, real, and, simply, a, figment, of, the, human, imagination, maya, means, that, the, world, is, not, as, it, seems, the, world, that, one, experiences, is, misleading, as, far, as, its, true, nature, is, concerned, according, to, wendy, doniger, to, say, that, the, universe, is, an, illusion, m, y, is, not, to, say, that, it, is, unreal, it, is, to, say, instead, that, it, is, not, what, it, seems, to, be, that, it, is, something, constantly, being, made, m, y, not, only, deceives, people, about, the, things, they, think, they, know, more, basically, it, limits, their, knowledge, in, the, upanishads, m, y, is, the, perceived, changing, reality, and, it, co, exists, with, brahman, which, is, the, hidden, true, reality, maya, or, illusion, is, an, important, idea, in, the, upanishads, because, the, texts, assert, that, in, the, human, pursuit, of, blissful, and, liberating, self, knowledge, it, is, maya, which, obscures, confuses, and, distracts, an, individual, the, upanishads, form, one, of, the, three, main, sources, for, all, schools, of, vedanta, together, with, the, bhagavad, gita, and, the, brahmasutras, due, to, the, wide, variety, of, philosophical, teachings, contained, in, the, upanishads, various, interpretations, could, be, grounded, on, the, upanishads, the, schools, of, ved, nta, seek, to, answer, questions, about, the, relation, between, atman, and, brahman, and, the, relation, between, brahman, and, the, world, the, schools, of, vedanta, are, named, after, the, relation, they, see, between, atman, and, brahman, other, schools, of, vedanta, include, nimbarka, s, dvaitadvaita, vallabha, s, suddhadvaita, and, chaitanya, s, acintya, bhedabheda, the, philosopher, adi, shankara, has, provided, commentaries, on, 11, mukhya, upanishads, advaita, literally, means, non, duality, and, it, is, a, monistic, system, of, thought, it, deals, with, the, non, dual, nature, of, brahman, and, atman, advaita, is, considered, the, most, influential, sub, school, of, the, vedanta, school, of, hindu, philosophy, gaudapada, was, the, first, person, to, expound, the, basic, principles, of, the, advaita, philosophy, in, a, commentary, on, the, conflicting, statements, of, the, upanishads, gaudapada, s, advaita, ideas, were, further, developed, by, shankara, 8th, century, ce, king, states, that, gaudapada, s, main, work, m, ukya, k, rik, is, infused, with, philosophical, terminology, of, buddhism, and, uses, buddhist, arguments, and, analogies, king, also, suggests, that, there, are, clear, differences, between, shankara, s, writings, and, the, brahmasutra, and, many, ideas, of, shankara, are, at, odds, with, those, in, the, upanishads, radhakrishnan, on, the, other, hand, suggests, that, shankara, s, views, of, advaita, were, straightforward, developments, of, the, upanishads, and, the, brahmasutra, and, many, ideas, of, shankara, derive, from, the, upanishads, shankara, in, his, discussions, of, the, advaita, vedanta, philosophy, referred, to, the, early, upanishads, to, explain, the, key, difference, between, hinduism, and, buddhism, stating, that, hinduism, asserts, that, atman, soul, self, exists, whereas, buddhism, asserts, that, there, is, no, soul, no, self, the, upanishads, contain, four, sentences, the, mah, v, kyas, great, sayings, which, were, used, by, shankara, to, establish, the, identity, of, atman, and, brahman, as, scriptural, truth, the, second, school, of, vedanta, is, the, vishishtadvaita, which, was, founded, by, ramanuja, 1017, 1137, ce, ramanuja, disagreed, with, adi, shankara, and, the, advaita, school, visistadvaita, is, a, synthetic, philosophy, bridging, the, monistic, advaita, and, theistic, dvaita, systems, of, vedanta, ramanuja, frequently, cited, the, upanishads, and, stated, that, vishishtadvaita, is, grounded, in, the, upanishads, ramanuja, s, vishishtadvaita, interpretation, of, the, upanishads, is, that, of, qualified, monism, ramanuja, interprets, the, upanishadic, literature, to, be, teaching, a, body, soul, theory, states, jeaneane, fowler, a, professor, of, philosophy, and, religious, studies, where, the, brahman, is, the, dweller, in, all, things, yet, also, distinct, and, beyond, all, things, as, the, soul, the, inner, controller, the, immortal, the, upanishads, according, to, the, vishishtadvaita, school, teach, individual, souls, to, be, of, the, same, quality, as, the, brahman, but, quantitatively, distinct, in, the, vishishtadvaita, school, the, upanishads, are, interpreted, to, be, teaching, about, ishvara, vishnu, who, is, the, seat, of, all, auspicious, qualities, with, all, of, the, empirically, perceived, world, as, the, body, of, god, who, dwells, in, everything, the, school, recommends, a, devotion, to, godliness, and, constant, remembrance, of, the, beauty, and, love, of, a, personal, god, this, ultimately, leads, one, to, the, oneness, with, abstract, brahman, the, brahman, in, the, upanishads, is, a, living, reality, states, fowler, and, the, atman, of, all, things, and, all, beings, in, ramanuja, s, interpretation, the, third, school, of, vedanta, called, the, dvaita, school, was, founded, by, madhvacharya, 1199, 1278, ce, it, is, regarded, as, a, strongly, theistic, philosophic, exposition, of, the, upanishads, madhvacharya, much, like, adi, shankara, claims, for, advaita, and, ramanuja, claims, for, vishishtadvaita, states, that, his, theistic, dvaita, vedanta, is, grounded, in, the, upanishads, according, to, the, dvaita, school, states, fowler, the, upanishads, that, speak, of, the, soul, as, brahman, speak, of, resemblance, and, not, identity, madhvacharya, interprets, the, upanishadic, teachings, of, the, self, becoming, one, with, brahman, as, entering, into, brahman, just, like, a, drop, enters, an, ocean, this, to, the, dvaita, school, implies, duality, and, dependence, where, brahman, and, atman, are, different, realities, brahman, is, a, separate, independent, and, supreme, reality, in, the, upanishads, atman, only, resembles, the, brahman, in, limited, inferior, dependent, manner, according, to, madhvacharya, ramanuja, s, vishishtadvaita, school, and, shankara, s, advaita, school, are, both, nondualism, vedanta, schools, both, are, premised, on, the, assumption, that, all, souls, can, hope, for, and, achieve, the, state, of, blissful, liberation, in, contrast, madhvacharya, believed, that, some, souls, are, eternally, doomed, and, damned, several, scholars, have, recognised, parallels, between, the, philosophy, of, pythagoras, and, plato, and, that, of, the, upanishads, including, their, ideas, on, sources, of, knowledge, concept, of, justice, and, path, to, salvation, and, plato, s, allegory, of, the, cave, platonic, psychology, with, its, divisions, of, reason, spirit, and, appetite, also, bears, resemblance, to, the, three, gu, as, in, the, indian, philosophy, of, samkhya, various, mechanisms, for, such, a, transmission, of, knowledge, have, been, conjectured, including, pythagoras, traveling, as, far, as, india, indian, philosophers, visiting, athens, and, meeting, socrates, plato, encountering, the, ideas, when, in, exile, in, syracuse, or, intermediated, through, persia, however, other, scholars, such, as, arthur, berriedale, keith, j, burnet, and, a, r, wadia, believe, that, the, two, systems, developed, independently, they, note, that, there, is, no, historical, evidence, of, the, philosophers, of, the, two, schools, meeting, and, point, out, significant, differences, in, the, stage, of, development, orientation, and, goals, of, the, two, philosophical, systems, wadia, writes, that, plato, s, metaphysics, were, rooted, in, this, life, and, his, primary, aim, was, to, develop, an, ideal, state, in, contrast, upanishadic, focus, was, the, individual, the, self, atman, soul, self, knowledge, and, the, means, of, an, individual, s, moksha, freedom, liberation, in, this, life, or, after, life, the, upanishads, have, been, translated, into, various, languages, including, persian, italian, urdu, french, latin, german, english, dutch, polish, japanese, spanish, and, russian, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, s, reign, 1556, 1586, saw, the, first, translations, of, the, upanishads, into, persian, his, great, grandson, dara, shukoh, produced, a, collection, called, sirr, i, akbar, in, 1656, wherein, 50, upanishads, were, translated, from, sanskrit, into, persian, anquetil, duperron, a, french, orientalist, received, a, manuscript, of, the, oupanekhat, and, translated, the, persian, version, into, french, and, latin, publishing, the, latin, translation, in, two, volumes, in, 1801, 1802, as, oupneck, hat, the, french, translation, was, never, published, more, recently, several, translations, in, french, of, some, upanishads, or, the, whole, of, 108, have, been, published, by, indianists, louis, renou, kausitaki, svetasvatra, prasna, taittiriya, upanisads, 1948, jean, varenne, mah, n, r, yana, upanisad, 1960, and, sept, upanishads, 1981, alyette, degr, ces, fadh, samny, sa, upanisad, upanisad, du, renoncement, 1989, martine, buttex, les, 108, upanishads, full, translation, 2012, the, latin, version, was, the, initial, introduction, of, the, upanishadic, thought, to, western, scholars, however, according, to, deussen, the, persian, translators, took, great, liberties, in, translating, the, text, and, at, times, changed, the, meaning, the, first, sanskrit, to, english, translation, of, the, aitareya, upanishad, was, made, by, colebrooke, in, 1805, and, the, first, english, translation, of, the, kena, upanishad, was, made, by, rammohun, roy, in, 1816, the, first, german, translation, appeared, in, 1832, and, roer, s, english, version, appeared, in, 1853, however, max, mueller, s, 1879, and, 1884, editions, were, the, first, systematic, english, treatment, to, include, the, 12, principal, upanishads, other, major, translations, of, the, upanishads, have, been, by, robert, ernest, hume, 13, principal, upanishads, paul, deussen, 60, upanishads, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, 18, upanishads, patrick, olivelle, 32, upanishads, in, two, books, and, bh, nu, swami, 13, upanishads, with, commentaries, of, vai, ava, c, ryas, olivelle, s, translation, won, the, 1998, a, k, ramanujan, book, prize, for, translation, throughout, the, 1930s, irish, poet, w, b, yeats, worked, with, the, indian, born, mendicant, teacher, shri, purohit, swami, on, their, own, translation, of, the, upanishads, eventually, titled, the, ten, principal, upanishads, and, published, in, 1938, this, translation, was, the, final, piece, of, work, published, by, yeats, before, his, death, less, than, a, year, later, the, german, philosopher, arthur, schopenhauer, read, the, latin, translation, and, praised, the, upanishads, in, his, main, work, the, world, as, will, and, representation, 1819, as, well, as, in, his, parerga, and, paralipomena, 1851, he, found, his, own, philosophy, in, accord, with, the, upanishads, which, taught, that, the, individual, is, a, manifestation, of, the, one, basis, of, reality, for, schopenhauer, that, fundamentally, real, underlying, unity, is, what, we, know, in, ourselves, as, will, schopenhauer, used, to, keep, a, copy, of, the, latin, oupnekhet, by, his, side, and, commented, in, the, whole, world, there, is, no, study, so, beneficial, and, so, elevating, as, that, of, the, upanishads, it, has, been, the, solace, of, my, life, it, will, be, the, solace, of, my, death, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, influenced, many, famous, people, and, introduced, them, to, the, upanishads, one, of, them, was, the, austrian, physicist, erwin, schr, dinger, who, once, wrote, there, is, obviously, only, one, alternative, he, wrote, namely, the, unification, of, minds, or, consciousnesses, their, multiplicity, is, only, apparent, in, truth, there, is, only, one, mind, this, is, the, doctrine, of, the, upanishads, another, german, philosopher, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, praised, the, ideas, in, the, upanishads, as, did, others, in, the, united, states, the, group, known, as, the, transcendentalists, were, influenced, by, the, german, idealists, americans, such, as, emerson, and, thoreau, embraced, schelling, s, interpretation, of, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, as, well, as, his, celebration, of, the, romantic, exotic, mystical, aspect, of, the, upanishads, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, these, writers, the, upanishads, gained, renown, in, western, countries, the, poet, t, s, eliot, inspired, by, his, reading, of, the, upanishads, based, the, final, portion, of, his, famous, poem, the, waste, land, 1922, upon, one, of, its, verses, according, to, eknath, easwaran, the, upanishads, are, snapshots, of, towering, peaks, of, consciousness, juan, mascar, a, professor, at, the, university, of, barcelona, and, a, translator, of, the, upanishads, states, that, the, upanishads, represents, for, the, hindu, approximately, what, the, new, testament, represents, for, the, christian, and, that, the, message, of, the, upanishads, can, be, summarized, in, the, words, the, kingdom, of, god, is, within, you, paul, deussen, in, his, review, of, the, upanishads, states, that, the, texts, emphasize, brahman, atman, as, something, that, can, be, experienced, but, not, defined, this, view, of, the, soul, and, self, are, similar, states, deussen, to, those, found, in, the, dialogues, of, plato, and, elsewhere, the, upanishads, insisted, on, oneness, of, soul, excluded, all, plurality, and, therefore, all, proximity, in, space, all, succession, in, time, all, interdependence, as, cause, and, effect, and, all, opposition, as, subject, and, object, max, m, ller, in, his, review, of, the, upanishads, summarizes, the, lack, of, systematic, philosophy, and, the, central, theme, in, the, upanishads, as, follows, there, is, not, what, could, be, called, a, philosophical, system, in, these, upanishads, they, are, in, the, true, sense, of, the, word, guesses, at, truth, frequently, contradicting, each, other, yet, all, tending, in, one, direction, the, key, note, of, the, old, upanishads, is, know, thyself, but, with, a, much, deeper, meaning, than, that, of, the, of, the, delphic, oracle, the, know, thyself, of, the, upanishads, means, know, thy, true, self, that, which, underlines, thine, ego, and, find, it, and, know, it, in, the, highest, the, eternal, self, the, one, without, a, second, which, underlies, the, whole, world
