religious, and, ethical, directives, structured, as, a, covenant, document, that, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, are, given, by, yahweh, to, moses, the, text, of, the, ten, commandments, was, dynamic, in, ancient, israel, and, appears, in, three, markedly, distinct, versions, in, the, bible, at, exodus, 20, 2, 17, deuteronomy, 5, 6, 21, and, the, ritual, decalogue, of, exodus, 34, 11, 26, according, to, the, book, of, exodus, in, the, torah, the, ten, commandments, were, revealed, to, moses, at, mount, sinai, told, by, moses, to, the, israelites, in, exodus, 19, 25, and, inscribed, by, the, finger, of, god, on, two, tablets, of, stone, scholars, disagree, about, when, the, ten, commandments, were, written, and, by, whom, with, some, modern, scholars, drawing, comparisons, between, the, decalogue, and, hittite, and, mesopotamian, laws, and, treaties, the, ten, commandments, called, transliterated, as, ret, haddevar, m, in, biblical, hebrew, are, mentioned, at, exodus, 34, 28, deuteronomy, 4, 13, and, deuteronomy, 10, 4, in, all, sources, the, terms, are, translatable, as, the, ten, words, the, ten, sayings, or, the, ten, matters, in, mishnaic, hebrew, they, are, called, as, ret, haddiber, t, a, precise, equivalent, in, the, septuagint, the, greek, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, was, translated, as, dek, logos, or, ten, words, this, greek, word, became, decalogus, in, latin, which, entered, the, english, language, as, decalogue, providing, an, alternative, name, for, the, ten, commandments, the, tyndale, and, coverdale, english, biblical, translations, used, ten, verses, the, geneva, bible, used, ten, commandments, which, was, followed, by, the, bishops, bible, and, the, authorized, version, the, king, james, version, as, ten, commandments, most, major, english, versions, use, the, word, commandments, the, stone, tablets, as, opposed, to, the, ten, commandments, inscribed, on, them, are, called, lukh, t, habber, t, tablets, of, the, covenant, or, lukhot, ha, edut, tablets, of, the, testimony, the, biblical, narrative, of, the, revelation, at, sinai, begins, in, exodus, 19, after, the, arrival, of, the, children, of, israel, at, mount, sinai, also, called, horeb, on, the, morning, of, the, third, day, of, their, encampment, there, were, thunders, and, lightnings, and, a, thick, cloud, upon, the, mount, and, the, voice, of, the, trumpet, exceeding, loud, and, the, people, assembled, at, the, base, of, the, mount, after, the, l, ord, came, down, upon, mount, sinai, moses, went, up, briefly, and, returned, to, prepare, the, people, and, then, in, exodus, 20, god, spoke, to, all, the, people, the, words, of, the, covenant, that, is, the, ten, commandments, as, it, is, written, modern, biblical, scholarship, differs, as, to, whether, exodus, 19, 20, describes, the, people, of, israel, as, having, directly, heard, all, or, some, of, the, decalogue, or, whether, the, laws, are, only, passed, to, them, through, moses, the, people, were, afraid, to, hear, more, and, moved, afar, off, and, moses, responded, with, fear, not, nevertheless, he, drew, near, the, thick, darkness, where, the, presence, of, the, lord, was, to, hear, the, additional, statutes, and, judgments, all, which, he, wrote, in, the, book, of, the, covenant, which, he, read, to, the, people, the, next, morning, and, they, agreed, to, be, obedient, and, do, all, that, the, l, ord, had, said, moses, escorted, a, select, group, consisting, of, aaron, nadab, and, abihu, and, seventy, of, the, elders, of, israel, to, a, location, on, the, mount, where, they, worshipped, afar, off, and, they, saw, the, god, of, israel, above, a, paved, work, like, clear, sapphire, stone, and, the, l, ord, said, unto, moses, come, up, to, me, into, the, mount, and, be, there, and, i, will, give, thee, tablets, of, stone, and, a, law, and, commandments, which, i, have, written, that, thou, mayest, teach, them, 13, and, moses, rose, up, and, his, minister, joshua, and, moses, went, up, into, the, mount, of, god, the, mount, was, covered, by, the, cloud, for, six, days, and, on, the, seventh, day, moses, went, into, the, midst, of, the, cloud, and, was, in, the, mount, forty, days, and, forty, nights, and, moses, said, the, l, ord, delivered, unto, me, two, tablets, of, stone, written, with, the, finger, of, god, and, on, them, was, written, according, to, all, the, words, which, the, l, ord, spake, with, you, in, the, mount, out, of, the, midst, of, the, fire, in, the, day, of, the, assembly, before, the, full, forty, days, expired, the, children, of, israel, collectively, decided, that, something, had, happened, to, moses, and, compelled, aaron, to, fashion, a, golden, calf, and, he, built, an, altar, before, it, and, the, people, worshipped, the, calf, after, the, full, forty, days, moses, and, joshua, came, down, from, the, mountain, with, the, tablets, of, stone, and, it, came, to, pass, as, soon, as, he, came, nigh, unto, the, camp, that, he, saw, the, calf, and, the, dancing, and, moses, anger, waxed, hot, and, he, cast, the, tablets, out, of, his, hands, and, brake, them, beneath, the, mount, after, the, events, in, chapters, 32, and, 33, the, l, ord, told, moses, hew, thee, two, tablets, of, stone, like, unto, the, first, and, i, will, write, upon, these, tablets, the, words, that, were, in, the, first, tablets, which, thou, brakest, and, he, wrote, on, the, tablets, according, to, the, first, writing, the, ten, commandments, which, the, l, ord, spake, unto, you, in, the, mount, out, of, the, midst, of, the, fire, in, the, day, of, the, assembly, and, the, l, ord, gave, them, unto, me, these, tablets, were, later, placed, in, the, ark, of, the, covenant, although, both, the, masoretic, text, and, the, dead, sea, scrolls, have, the, passages, of, exodus, 20, and, deuteronomy, 5, divided, into, ten, specific, commandments, formatted, with, space, between, them, corresponding, to, the, lutheran, counting, in, the, chart, below, many, modern, english, bible, translations, give, the, appearance, of, more, than, ten, imperative, statements, in, each, passage, different, religious, traditions, categorize, the, seventeen, verses, of, exodus, 20, 1, 17, and, their, parallels, in, deuteronomy, 5, 4, 21, into, ten, commandments, in, different, ways, as, shown, in, the, table, some, suggest, that, the, number, ten, is, a, choice, to, aid, memorization, rather, than, a, matter, of, theology, there, are, two, major, approaches, to, categorizing, the, commandments, one, approach, distinguishes, the, prohibition, against, other, gods, verse, 3, from, the, prohibition, against, images, verses, 4, 6, another, approach, combines, verses, 3, 6, the, prohibition, against, images, and, the, prohibition, against, other, gods, into, a, single, command, while, still, maintaining, ten, commandments, samaritan, and, jewish, traditions, include, another, commandment, whereas, christian, traditions, will, divide, coveting, the, neighbor, s, wife, and, house, the, ten, commandments, concern, matters, of, fundamental, importance, in, judaism, and, christianity, the, greatest, obligation, to, worship, only, god, the, greatest, injury, to, a, person, murder, the, greatest, injury, to, family, bonds, adultery, the, greatest, injury, to, commerce, and, law, bearing, false, witness, the, greatest, inter, generational, obligation, honour, to, parents, the, greatest, obligation, to, community, truthfulness, the, greatest, injury, to, movable, property, theft, the, ten, commandments, are, written, with, room, for, varying, interpretation, reflecting, their, role, as, a, summary, of, fundamental, principles, they, are, not, as, explicit, or, as, detailed, as, rules, or, as, many, other, biblical, laws, and, commandments, because, they, provide, guiding, principles, that, apply, universally, across, changing, circumstances, they, do, not, specify, punishments, for, their, violation, their, precise, import, must, be, worked, out, in, each, separate, situation, the, bible, indicates, the, special, status, of, the, ten, commandments, among, all, other, torah, laws, in, several, ways, the, ten, commandments, form, the, basis, of, jewish, law, stating, god, s, universal, and, timeless, standard, of, right, and, wrong, unlike, the, rest, of, the, 613, commandments, in, the, torah, which, include, for, example, various, duties, and, ceremonies, such, as, the, kashrut, dietary, laws, and, the, rituals, to, be, performed, by, priests, in, the, holy, temple, jewish, tradition, considers, the, ten, commandments, the, theological, basis, for, the, rest, of, the, commandments, philo, in, his, four, book, work, the, special, laws, treated, the, ten, commandments, as, headings, under, which, he, discussed, other, related, commandments, similarly, in, the, decalogue, he, stated, that, under, many, other, commands, are, conveyed, by, implication, such, as, that, against, seducers, that, against, practisers, of, unnatural, crimes, that, against, all, who, live, in, debauchery, that, against, all, men, who, indulge, in, illicit, and, incontinent, connections, others, such, as, rabbi, saadia, gaon, have, also, made, groupings, of, the, commandments, according, to, their, links, with, the, ten, commandments, according, to, conservative, rabbi, louis, ginzberg, ten, commandments, are, virtually, entwined, in, that, the, breaking, of, one, leads, to, the, breaking, of, another, echoing, an, earlier, rabbinic, comment, found, in, the, commentary, of, rashi, to, the, songs, of, songs, 4, 5, ginzberg, explained, there, is, also, a, great, bond, of, union, between, the, first, five, commandments, and, the, last, five, the, first, commandment, i, am, the, lord, thy, god, corresponds, to, the, sixth, thou, shalt, not, kill, for, the, murderer, slays, the, image, of, god, the, second, thou, shalt, have, no, strange, gods, before, me, corresponds, to, the, seventh, thou, shalt, not, commit, adultery, for, conjugal, faithlessness, is, as, grave, a, sin, as, idolatry, which, is, faithlessness, to, god, the, third, commandment, thou, shalt, not, take, the, name, of, the, lord, in, vain, corresponds, to, the, eighth, thou, shalt, not, steal, for, stealing, results, in, a, false, oath, in, god, s, name, the, fourth, remember, the, sabbath, day, to, keep, it, holy, corresponds, to, the, ninth, thou, shalt, not, bear, false, witness, against, thy, neighbor, for, he, who, bears, false, witness, against, his, neighbor, commits, as, grave, a, sin, as, if, he, had, borne, false, witness, against, god, saying, that, he, had, not, created, the, world, in, six, days, and, rested, on, the, seventh, day, the, holy, sabbath, the, fifth, commandment, honor, thy, father, and, thy, mother, corresponds, to, the, tenth, covet, not, thy, neighbor, s, wife, for, one, who, indulges, this, lust, produces, children, who, will, not, honor, their, true, father, but, will, consider, a, stranger, their, father, the, traditional, rabbinical, jewish, belief, is, that, the, observance, of, these, commandments, and, the, other, mitzvot, are, required, solely, of, the, jewish, people, and, that, the, laws, incumbent, on, humanity, in, general, are, outlined, in, the, seven, noahide, laws, several, of, which, overlap, with, the, ten, commandments, in, the, era, of, the, sanhedrin, transgressing, any, one, of, six, of, the, ten, commandments, theoretically, carried, the, death, penalty, the, exceptions, being, the, first, commandment, honouring, your, father, and, mother, saying, god, s, name, in, vain, and, coveting, though, this, was, rarely, enforced, due, to, a, large, number, of, stringent, evidentiary, requirements, imposed, by, the, oral, law, the, arrangement, of, the, commandments, on, the, two, tablets, is, interpreted, in, different, ways, in, the, classical, jewish, tradition, rabbi, hanina, ben, gamaliel, says, that, each, tablet, contained, five, commandments, but, the, sages, say, ten, on, one, tablet, and, ten, on, the, other, that, is, that, the, tablets, were, duplicates, this, can, be, compared, to, diplomatic, treaties, of, the, ancient, near, east, in, which, a, copy, was, made, for, each, party, according, to, the, talmud, the, compendium, of, traditional, rabbinic, jewish, law, tradition, and, interpretation, one, interpretation, of, the, biblical, verse, the, tablets, were, written, on, both, their, sides, is, that, the, carving, went, through, the, full, thickness, of, the, tablets, yet, was, miraculously, legible, from, both, sides, the, mishna, records, that, during, the, period, of, the, second, temple, the, ten, commandments, were, recited, daily, before, the, reading, of, the, shema, yisrael, as, preserved, for, example, in, the, nash, papyrus, a, hebrew, manuscript, fragment, from, 150, to, 100, bc, found, in, egypt, containing, a, version, of, the, ten, commandments, and, the, beginning, of, the, shema, but, that, this, practice, was, abolished, in, the, synagogues, so, as, not, to, give, ammunition, to, heretics, who, claimed, that, they, were, the, only, important, part, of, jewish, law, or, to, dispel, a, claim, by, early, christians, that, only, the, ten, commandments, were, handed, down, at, mount, sinai, rather, than, the, whole, torah, in, later, centuries, rabbis, continued, to, omit, the, ten, commandments, from, daily, liturgy, in, order, to, prevent, confusion, among, jews, that, they, are, only, bound, by, the, ten, commandments, and, not, also, by, many, other, biblical, and, talmudic, laws, such, as, the, requirement, to, observe, holy, days, other, than, the, sabbath, however, some, rabbinic, authorities, still, recommend, reading, the, ten, commandments, privately, as, part, of, unscheduled, non, communal, prayer, the, ten, commandments, are, included, in, some, prayerbooks, for, this, purpose, today, the, ten, commandments, are, heard, in, the, synagogue, three, times, a, year, as, they, come, up, during, the, readings, of, exodus, and, deuteronomy, and, during, the, festival, of, shavuot, the, exodus, version, is, read, in, parashat, yitro, around, late, january, february, and, on, the, festival, of, shavuot, and, the, deuteronomy, version, in, parashat, va, etchanan, in, august, september, in, some, traditions, worshipers, rise, for, the, reading, of, the, ten, commandments, to, highlight, their, special, significance, though, many, rabbis, including, maimonides, have, opposed, this, custom, since, one, may, come, to, think, that, the, ten, commandments, are, more, important, than, the, rest, of, the, mitzvot, in, printed, chumashim, as, well, as, in, those, in, manuscript, form, the, ten, commandments, carry, two, sets, of, cantillation, marks, the, ta, am, elyon, upper, accentuation, which, makes, each, commandment, into, a, separate, verse, is, used, for, public, torah, reading, while, the, ta, am, tachton, lower, accentuation, which, divides, the, text, into, verses, of, more, even, length, is, used, for, private, reading, or, study, the, verse, numbering, in, jewish, bibles, follows, the, ta, am, tachton, in, jewish, bibles, the, references, to, the, ten, commandments, are, therefore, exodus, 20, 2, 14, and, deuteronomy, 5, 6, 18, the, samaritan, pentateuch, varies, in, the, ten, commandments, passages, both, in, that, the, samaritan, deuteronomical, version, of, the, passage, is, much, closer, to, that, in, exodus, and, in, that, samaritans, count, as, nine, commandments, what, others, count, as, ten, the, samaritan, tenth, commandment, is, on, the, sanctity, of, mount, gerizim, the, text, of, the, samaritan, tenth, commandment, follows, and, it, shall, come, to, pass, when, the, lord, thy, god, will, bring, thee, into, the, land, of, the, canaanites, whither, thou, goest, to, take, possession, of, it, thou, shalt, erect, unto, thee, large, stones, and, thou, shalt, cover, them, with, lime, and, thou, shalt, write, upon, the, stones, all, the, words, of, this, law, and, it, shall, come, to, pass, when, ye, cross, the, jordan, ye, shall, erect, these, stones, which, i, command, thee, upon, mount, gerizim, and, thou, shalt, build, there, an, altar, unto, the, lord, thy, god, an, altar, of, stones, and, thou, shalt, not, lift, upon, them, iron, of, perfect, stones, shalt, thou, build, thine, altar, and, thou, shalt, bring, upon, it, burnt, offerings, to, the, lord, thy, god, and, thou, shalt, sacrifice, peace, offerings, and, thou, shalt, eat, there, and, rejoice, before, the, lord, thy, god, that, mountain, is, on, the, other, side, of, the, jordan, at, the, end, of, the, road, towards, the, going, down, of, the, sun, in, the, land, of, the, canaanites, who, dwell, in, the, arabah, facing, gilgal, close, by, elon, moreh, facing, shechem, most, traditions, of, christianity, hold, that, the, ten, commandments, have, divine, authority, and, continue, to, be, valid, though, they, have, different, interpretations, and, uses, of, them, the, apostolic, constitutions, which, implore, believers, to, always, remember, the, ten, commands, of, god, reveal, the, importance, of, the, decalogue, in, the, early, church, through, most, of, christian, history, the, decalogue, was, considered, a, summary, of, god, s, law, and, standard, of, behaviour, central, to, christian, life, piety, and, worship, distinctions, in, the, order, and, importance, of, said, order, continues, to, be, a, theological, debate, with, texts, within, the, new, testament, romans, 13, 9, confirming, the, more, traditional, ordering, which, follows, the, septuagint, of, adultery, murder, and, theft, as, opposed, to, the, currently, held, order, of, the, masoretic, of, murder, adultery, theft, during, his, sermon, on, the, mount, jesus, explicitly, referenced, the, prohibitions, against, murder, and, adultery, in, matthew, 19, 16, 19, jesus, repeated, five, of, the, ten, commandments, followed, by, that, commandment, called, the, second, matthew, 22, 34, 40, after, the, first, and, great, commandment, and, behold, one, came, and, said, unto, him, good, master, what, good, thing, shall, i, do, that, i, may, have, eternal, life, and, he, said, unto, him, why, callest, thou, me, good, there, is, none, good, but, one, that, is, god, but, if, thou, wilt, enter, into, life, keep, the, commandments, he, saith, unto, him, which, jesus, said, thou, shalt, do, no, murder, thou, shalt, not, commit, adultery, thou, shalt, not, steal, thou, shalt, not, bear, false, witness, honour, thy, father, and, thy, mother, and, thou, shalt, love, thy, neighbour, as, thyself, in, his, epistle, to, the, romans, paul, the, apostle, also, mentioned, five, of, the, ten, commandments, and, associated, them, with, the, neighbourly, love, commandment, owe, no, man, any, thing, but, to, love, one, another, for, he, that, loveth, another, hath, fulfilled, the, law, for, this, thou, shalt, not, commit, adultery, thou, shalt, not, kill, thou, shalt, not, steal, thou, shalt, not, bear, false, witness, thou, shalt, not, covet, and, if, there, be, any, other, commandment, it, is, briefly, comprehended, in, this, saying, namely, thou, shalt, love, thy, neighbour, as, thyself, love, worketh, no, ill, to, his, neighbour, therefore, love, is, the, fulfilling, of, the, law, in, anglicanism, the, articles, of, the, church, of, england, revised, and, altered, by, the, assembly, of, divines, at, westminster, in, the, year, 1643, state, that, no, christian, man, whatsoever, is, free, from, the, obedience, of, the, commandments, which, are, called, moral, by, the, moral, law, we, understand, all, the, ten, commandments, taken, in, their, full, extent, baptists, believe, the, ten, commandments, are, a, summary, of, the, requirements, of, a, works, covenant, called, the, old, covenant, given, on, mount, sinai, to, the, nascent, nation, of, israel, the, old, covenant, is, fulfilled, by, christ, at, the, cross, unbelievers, are, still, under, the, law, the, law, reveals, man, s, sin, and, need, for, the, salvation, that, is, jeshua, repentance, from, sin, and, faith, in, christ, for, salvation, is, the, point, of, the, entire, bible, they, do, reflect, the, eternal, character, of, god, and, serve, as, a, paragon, of, morality, in, catholicism, it, is, believed, that, jesus, freed, christians, from, the, rest, of, jewish, religious, law, but, not, from, their, obligation, to, keep, the, ten, commandments, it, has, been, said, that, they, are, to, the, moral, order, what, the, creation, story, is, to, the, natural, order, according, to, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, the, official, exposition, of, the, catholic, church, s, christian, beliefs, the, commandments, are, considered, essential, for, spiritual, good, health, and, growth, and, serve, as, the, basis, for, social, justice, church, teaching, of, the, commandments, is, largely, based, on, the, old, and, new, testaments, and, the, writings, of, the, early, church, fathers, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, believes, that, in, the, new, testament, jesus, acknowledged, their, validity, summarizing, them, into, two, great, commandments, the, great, commandments, contain, the, law, of, the, gospel, summed, up, in, the, golden, rule, the, law, of, the, gospel, is, expressed, particularly, in, the, sermon, on, the, mount, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, explains, that, the, law, of, the, gospel, fulfills, the, commandments, of, the, law, the, lord, s, sermon, on, the, mount, far, from, abolishing, or, devaluing, the, moral, prescriptions, of, the, old, law, releases, their, hidden, potential, and, has, new, demands, arise, from, them, it, reveals, their, entire, divine, and, human, truth, it, does, not, add, new, external, precepts, but, proceeds, to, reform, the, heart, the, root, of, human, acts, where, man, chooses, between, the, pure, and, the, impure, where, faith, hope, and, charity, are, formed, and, with, them, the, other, virtues, the, new, law, fulfills, refines, surpasses, and, leads, the, old, law, to, its, perfection, the, lutheran, division, of, the, commandments, follows, the, one, established, by, st, augustine, following, the, then, current, synagogue, scribal, division, the, first, three, commandments, govern, the, relationship, between, god, and, humans, the, fourth, through, eighth, govern, public, relationships, between, people, and, the, last, two, govern, private, thoughts, see, luther, s, small, catechism, and, large, catechism, the, moral, law, contained, in, the, ten, commandments, according, to, the, founder, of, the, methodist, movement, john, wesley, was, instituted, from, the, beginning, of, the, world, and, is, written, on, the, hearts, of, all, people, as, with, the, reformed, view, wesley, held, that, the, moral, law, which, is, contained, in, the, ten, commandments, stands, today, every, part, of, this, law, must, remain, in, force, upon, all, mankind, in, all, ages, as, not, depending, either, on, time, or, place, nor, on, any, other, circumstances, liable, to, change, but, on, the, nature, of, god, and, the, nature, of, man, and, their, unchangeable, relation, to, each, other, wesley, s, sermons, vol, i, sermon, 25, in, keeping, with, wesleyan, covenant, theology, while, the, ceremonial, law, was, abolished, in, christ, and, the, whole, mosaic, dispensation, itself, was, concluded, upon, the, appearance, of, christ, the, moral, law, remains, a, vital, component, of, the, covenant, of, grace, having, christ, as, its, perfecting, end, as, such, in, methodism, an, important, aspect, of, the, pursuit, of, sanctification, is, the, careful, following, of, the, ten, commandments, the, eastern, orthodox, church, holds, its, moral, truths, to, be, chiefly, contained, in, the, ten, commandments, a, confession, begins, with, the, confessor, reciting, the, ten, commandments, and, asking, the, penitent, which, of, them, he, has, broken, the, pentecostal, christianity, believes, the, ten, commandments, were, given, directly, from, god, summarizing, the, absolutes, of, spiritual, and, moral, living, that, god, intended, for, his, people, they, also, attach, a, specific, significance, observing, that, the, feast, of, pentecost, commemorates, the, giving, of, the, ten, commandments, to, moses, this, view, admitted, by, several, founders, of, the, pentecostal, church, has, passed, into, modern, christian, ethic, where, the, feast, is, also, celebrated, as, the, day, of, the, giving, of, the, law, or, shavuot, as, observed, by, judaic, liturgical, books,

there, are, several, denominations, of, christianity, in, general, gives, more, importance, to, biblical, law, and, the, gospel, rejecting, the, moral, theology, of, roman, catholicism, early, protestant, theologians, continued, to, take, the, ten, commandments, as, the, starting, point, of, christian, moral, life, different, versions, of, christianity, have, varied, in, how, they, have, translated, the, bare, principles, into, the, specifics, that, make, up, a, full, christian, ethic, with, the, emergence, of, various, modern, versions, of, protestanism, there, are, several, modern, churches, that, believe, and, teach, their, adherents, that, all, of, the, law, of, moses, was, fulfilled, by, jesus, christ, by, his, crucifixion, death, and, resurrection, and, the, law, of, moses, including, the, ten, commandments, no, longer, apply, to, them, while, others, believe, in, following, only, the, commandments, that, appear, in, the, new, testament, and, hence, do, not, follow, or, observe, them, as, part, of, their, faith, and, worship, according, to, the, doctrine, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, jesus, completed, rather, than, rejected, the,

that, commandments, they, are, not, suggestions, in, that, same, talk, he, used, small, quotations, listing, the, numbering, and, selection, of, the, commandments, this, and, other, sources, don, t, include, the, prologue, making, it, most, consistent, with, the, septuagint, numbering, a, splinter, group, of, the, church, called, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, strangite, have, a, belief, similar, to, the, samaritans, where, they, have, the, entire, ten, commandments, in, their, scripture, where, others, only, have, nine, the, strangite, fourth, commandment, is, thou, shalt, love, thy, neighbor, as, thyself, the, strangite, s, founder, and, namesake, james, strang, wrote, in, note, on, the, decalogue, as, part, of, the, book, of, the, law, of, the, lord, a, strangite, holy, book, that, no, other, version, of, the, decalogue, contains, more, than, nine, commandments, and, speculated, that, his, fourth, commandment, was, omitted, from, other, works, perhaps, as, early, as, josephus, time, circa, 37, 100, ad, the, receiving, of, the, ten, commandments, by, prophet, musa, moses, is, dealt, with, in, much, detail, in, islamic, tradition, with, the, meeting, of, moses, with, god, on, mount, sinai, described, in, surah, a, raf, 7, 142, 145, the, revealing, of, the, tablets, on, which, were, the, commandments, of, god, is, described, in, the, following, verse, and, we, wrote, for, him, moses, on, the, tablets, the, lesson, to, be, drawn, from, all, things, and, the, explanation, of, all, things, and, said, hold, unto, these, with, firmness, and, enjoin, your, people, to, take, the, better, therein, i, shall, show, you, the, home, of, al, fasiqun, the, rebellious, disobedient, to, allah, the, tablets, are, further, alluded, to, in, verses, 7, 150, when, moses, threw, the, tablets, down, in, anger, at, seeing, the, israelites, worshipping, of, the, golden, calf, and, in, 7, 154, when, he, picked, up, the, tablets, having, recovered, from, his, anger, and, when, the, anger, of, musa, moses, was, appeased, he, took, up, the, tablets, and, in, their, inscription, was, guidance, and, mercy, for, those, who, fear, their, lord, three, verses, of, surah, an, am, 6, 151, 153, are, widely, taken, to, be, a, reinstatement, or, revised, version, of, the, ten, commandments, either, as, revealed, to, moses, originally, or, as, they, are, to, be, taken, by, muslims, now, 151, say, come, i, will, recite, what, your, lord, has, prohibited, you, from, 1, join, not, anything, in, worship, with, him, 2, and, be, good, and, dutiful, to, your, parents, 3, and, kill, not, your, children, because, of, poverty, we, provide, sustenance, for, you, and, for, them, 4, and, come, not, near, to, al, fawahish, shameful, sins, illegal, sexual, intercourse, adultery, etc, whether, committed, openly, or, secretly, 5, and, kill, not, anyone, whom, allah, has, forbidden, except, for, a, just, cause, according, to, the, law, this, he, has, commanded, you, that, you, may, understand, 152, 6, and, come, not, near, to, the, orphan, s, property, except, to, improve, it, until, he, or, she, attains, the, age, of, full, strength, 7, and, give, full, measure, and, full, weight, with, justice, we, burden, not, any, person, but, that, which, he, can, bear, 8, and, whenever, you, give, your, word, i, e, judge, between, men, or, give, evidence, etc, say, the, truth, even, if, a, near, relative, is, concerned, 9, and, fulfill, the, covenant, of, allah, this, he, commands, you, that, you, may, remember, 153, 10, and, verily, this, the, commandments, mentioned, in, the, above, verses, is, my, straight, path, so, follow, it, and, follow, not, other, paths, for, they, will, separate, you, away, from, his, path, this, he, has, ordained, for, you, that, you, may, become, al, muttaqun, the, pious, evidence, for, these, verses, having, some, relation, to, moses, and, the, ten, commandments, is, from, the, verse, which, immediately, follows, them, then, we, gave, musa, moses, the, book, to, complete, our, favour, upon, those, who, would, do, right, and, explaining, all, things, in, detail, and, a, guidance, and, a, mercy, that, they, might, believe, in, the, meeting, with, their, lord, according, to, a, narration, in, mustadrak, hakim, ibn, abbas, a, prominent, narrator, of, israiliyat, traditions, said, in, surah, al, an, am, there, are, clear, ayat, and, they, are, the, mother, of, the, book, the, qur, an, he, then, recited, the, above, verses, also, in, mustadrak, hakim, is, the, narration, of, ubada, ibn, as, samit, the, messenger, of, allah, said, who, among, you, will, give, me, his, pledge, to, do, three, things, he, then, recited, the, above, ayah, 6, 151, 153, he, then, said, whoever, fulfills, this, pledge, then, his, reward, will, be, with, allah, but, whoever, fell, into, shortcomings, and, allah, punishes, him, for, it, in, this, life, then, that, will, be, his, recompense, whoever, allah, delays, his, reckoning, until, the, hereafter, then, his, matter, is, with, allah, if, he, wills, he, will, punish, him, and, if, he, wills, he, will, forgive, him, ibn, kathir, mentions, a, narration, of, abdullah, ibn, mas, ud, in, his, tafsir, whoever, wishes, to, read, the, will, and, testament, of, the, messenger, of, allah, on, which, he, placed, his, seal, let, him, read, these, ayat, 6, 151, 153, the, abrahamic, religions, observe, the, sabbath, in, various, ways, in, judaism, it, is, observed, on, saturday, reckoned, from, dusk, to, dusk, in, christianity, it, is, sometimes, observed, on, saturday, sometimes, on, sunday, and, sometimes, not, at, all, non, sabbatarianism, observing, the, sabbath, on, sunday, the, day, of, resurrection, gradually, became, the, dominant, christian, practice, from, the, jewish, roman, wars, onward, the, church, s, general, repudiation, of, jewish, practices, during, this, period, is, apparent, in, the, council, of, laodicea, 4th, century, ad, where, canons, 37, 38, state, it, is, not, lawful, to, receive, portions, sent, from, the, feasts, of, jews, or, heretics, nor, to, feast, together, with, them, and, it, is, not, lawful, to, receive, unleavened, bread, from, the, jews, nor, to, be, partakers, of, their, impiety, canon, 29, of, the, laodicean, council, specifically, refers, to, the, sabbath, christians, must, not, judaize, by, resting, on, the, sabbath, but, must, work, on, that, day, rather, honouring, the, lord, s, day, and, if, they, can, resting, then, as, christians, but, if, any, shall, be, found, to, be, judaizers, let, them, be, anathema, from, christ, multiple, translations, exist, of, the, fifth, sixth, commandment, the, hebrew, words, lo, tirtzach, are, variously, translated, as, thou, shalt, not, kill, or, thou, shalt, not, murder, the, imperative, is, against, unlawful, killing, resulting, in, bloodguilt, the, hebrew, bible, contains, numerous, prohibitions, against, unlawful, killing, but, does, not, prohibit, killing, in, the, context, of, warfare, 1kings, 2, 5, 6, capital, punishment, leviticus, 20, 9, 16, or, defending, against, a, home, invasion, exodus, 22, 2, 3, which, are, considered, justified, the, new, testament, is, in, agreement, that, murder, is, a, grave, moral, evil, and, references, the, old, testament, view, of, bloodguilt, german, old, testament, scholar, albrecht, alt, das, verbot, des, diebstahls, im, dekalog, 1953, suggested, that, the, commandment, translated, as, thou, shalt, not, steal, was, originally, intended, against, stealing, people, against, abductions, and, slavery, in, agreement, with, the, talmudic, interpretation, of, the, statement, as, thou, shalt, not, kidnap, sanhedrin, 86a, alt, s, claim, is, somewhat, questionable, because, the, decalogue, verse, exodus, 20, 12, deuteronomy, 5, 16, forbids, theft, in, general, whereas, the, sanhedrin, 86a, discussion, abductions, and, slavery, deals, with, another, biblical, verse, deuteronomy, 24, 7, which, explicitly, refers, to, theft, i, e, abduction, of, a, person, in, order, to, sell, that, person, in, judaism, there, is, a, prohibition, against, making, or, worshipping, an, idol, or, a, representation, of, god, but, there, is, no, restriction, on, art, or, simple, depictions, unrelated, to, god, islam, has, a, stronger, prohibition, banning, not, just, representations, of, god, but, also, in, some, cases, of, muhammad, humans, and, in, some, interpretations, any, living, creature, in, the, non, canonical, gospel, of, barnabas, it, is, claimed, that, jesus, stated, that, idolatry, is, the, greatest, sin, as, it, divests, a, man, fully, of, faith, and, hence, of, god, the, words, attributed, to, jesus, prohibit, not, only, worshipping, statues, of, wood, or, stone, but, also, statues, of, flesh, all, which, a, man, loves, for, which, he, leaves, everything, else, but, that, is, his, god, thus, the, glutton, and, drunkard, has, for, his, idol, his, own, flesh, the, fornicator, has, for, his, idol, the, harlot, and, the, greedy, has, for, his, idol, silver, and, gold, and, so, the, same, for, every, other, sinner, idolatory, was, thus, the, basic, sin, which, manifested, in, various, acts, or, thoughts, which, displace, the, primacy, of, god, however, the, gospel, of, barnabas, does, not, form, part, of, the, christian, bible, it, is, known, only, from, 16th, and, 17th, century, manuscripts, and, frequently, reflects, islamic, rather, than, christian, understandings, eastern, orthodox, tradition, teaches, that, while, images, of, god, the, father, remain, prohibited, depictions, of, jesus, as, the, incarnation, of, god, as, a, visible, human, are, permissible, to, emphasize, the, theological, importance, of, the, incarnation, the, orthodox, church, encourages, the, use, of, icons, in, church, and, private, devotions, but, prefers, a, two, dimensional, depiction, in, modern, use, usually, as, a, result, of, roman, catholic, influence, more, naturalistic, images, and, images, of, the, father, however, also, appear, occasionally, in, orthodox, churches, but, statues, i, e, three, dimensional, depictions, continue, to, be, banned, this, commandment, forbade, male, israelites, from, having, sexual, intercourse, with, the, wife, of, another, israelite, the, prohibition, did, not, extend, to, their, own, slaves, sexual, intercourse, between, an, israelite, man, married, or, not, and, a, woman, who, was, neither, married, nor, betrothed, was, not, considered, adultery, this, concept, of, adultery, stems, from, a, society, that, was, not, strictly, monogamous, where, the, patriarchal, economic, aspect, of, israelite, marriage, gave, the, husband, an, exclusive, right, to, his, wife, whereas, the, wife, as, the, husband, s, possession, did, not, have, an, exclusive, right, to, her, husband, louis, ginzberg, argued, that, the, tenth, commandment, covet, not, thy, neighbor, s, wife, is, directed, against, a, sin, which, may, lead, to, a, trespassing, of, all, ten, commandments, critical, scholarship, is, divided, over, its, interpretation, of, the, ten, commandment, texts, julius, wellhausen, s, documentary, hypothesis, 1883, suggests, that, exodus, 20, 23, and, 34, might, be, regarded, as, the, document, which, formed, the, starting, point, of, the, religious, history, of, israel, deuteronomy, 5, then, reflects, king, josiah, s, attempt, to, link, the, document, produced, by, his, court, to, the, older, mosaic, tradition, in, a, 2002, analysis, of, the, history, of, this, position, bernard, m, levinson, argued, that, this, reconstruction, assumes, a, christian, perspective, and, dates, back, to, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, s, polemic, against, judaism, which, asserted, that, religions, evolve, from, the, more, ritualistic, to, the, more, ethical, goethe, thus, argued, that, the, ten, commandments, revealed, to, moses, at, mount, sinai, would, have, emphasized, rituals, and, that, the, ethical, decalogue, christians, recite, in, their, own, churches, was, composed, at, a, later, date, when, israelite, prophets, had, begun, to, prophesy, the, coming, of, the, messiah, levinson, points, out, that, there, is, no, evidence, internal, to, the, hebrew, bible, or, in, external, sources, to, support, this, conjecture, he, concludes, that, its, vogue, among, later, critical, historians, represents, the, persistence, of, the, idea, that, the, supersession, of, judaism, by, christianity, is, part, of, a, longer, history, of, progress, from, the, ritualistic, to, the, ethical, by, the, 1930s, historians, who, accepted, the, basic, premises, of, multiple, authorship, had, come, to, reject, the, idea, of, an, orderly, evolution, of, israelite, religion, critics, instead, began, to, suppose, that, law, and, ritual, could, be, of, equal, importance, while, taking, different, form, at, different, times, this, means, that, there, is, no, longer, any, a, priori, reason, to, believe, that, exodus, 20, 2, 17, and, exodus, 34, 10, 28, were, composed, during, different, stages, of, israelite, history, according, to, john, bright, there, was, an, important, distinction, between, the, decalogue, and, the, book, of, the, covenant, exodus, 21, 23, and, 34, 10, 24, the, decalogue, he, argues, was, modelled, on, the, suzerainty, treaties, of, the, hittites, and, other, mesopotamian, empires, that, is, represents, the, relationship, between, god, and, israel, as, a, relationship, between, king, and, vassal, and, enacts, that, bond, the, prologue, of, the, hittite, treaty, reminds, his, vassals, of, his, benevolent, acts, compare, with, exodus, 20, 2, i, am, the, l, ord, your, god, who, brought, you, out, of, the, land, of, egypt, out, of, the, house, of, slavery, the, hittite, treaty, also, stipulated, the, obligations, imposed, by, the, ruler, on, his, vassals, which, included, a, prohibition, of, relations, with, peoples, outside, the, empire, or, enmity, between, those, within, exodus, 20, 3, you, shall, have, no, other, gods, before, me, viewed, as, a, treaty, rather, than, a, law, code, its, purpose, is, not, so, much, to, regulate, human, affairs, as, to, define, the, scope, of, the, king, s, power, julius, morgenstern, argued, that, exodus, 34, was, distinct, from, the, jahwist, document, identifying, it, with, king, asa, s, reforms, in, 899, bc, bright, however, believes, that, like, the, decalogue, this, text, has, its, origins, in, the, time, of, the, tribal, alliance, the, book, of, the, covenant, he, notes, bears, a, greater, similarity, to, mesopotamian, law, codes, e, g, the, code, of, hammurabi, which, was, inscribed, on, a, stone, stele, he, argues, that, the, function, of, this, book, is, to, move, from, the, realm, of, treaty, to, the, realm, of, law, the, book, of, the, covenant, ex, chs, 21, to, 23, cf, ch, 34, which, is, no, official, state, law, but, a, description, of, normative, israelite, judicial, procedure, in, the, days, of, the, judges, is, the, best, example, of, this, process, according, to, bright, then, this, body, of, law, too, predates, the, monarchy, according, to, kaufmann, the, decalogue, and, the, book, of, the, covenant, represent, two, ways, of, manifesting, god, s, presence, in, israel, the, ten, commandments, taking, the, archaic, and, material, form, of, stone, tablets, kept, in, the, ark, of, the, covenant, while, the, book, of, the, covenant, took, oral, form, to, be, recited, to, the, people, scholars, disagree, about, when, the, ten, commandments, were, written, and, by, whom, with, some, modern, scholars, suggesting, that, they, were, likely, modeled, on, hittite, and, mesopotamian, laws, and, treaties, 140, michael, coogan, argues, that, each, of, the, three, versions, of, the, ten, commandments, are, significantly, different, indicating, that, its, text, was, not, fixed, in, ancient, israel, archaeologists, israel, finkelstein, and, neil, asher, silberman, argue, that, the, astonishing, composition, came, together, in, the, seventh, century, bc, an, even, later, date, after, 586, bc, is, suggested, by, david, h, aaron, his, book, argues, for, the, probability, that, these, documents, were, written, very, late, in, the, history, of, biblical, literature, indeed, so, late, as, to, constitute, a, literary, afterthought, in, the, development, of, israelite, ethnic, self, definition, biblical, scholar, timothy, s, hogue, argues, that, the, decalogue, in, the, book, of, exodus, originated, in, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, around, the, 9th, 8th, centuries, bc, based, on, parallels, with, luwian, texts, from, that, time, as, well, as, the, references, in, the, decalogue, to, the, masseboth, which, were, destroyed, during, the, religious, reforms, of, hezekiah, and, josiah, according, to, book, of, deuteronomy, the, tablets, were, placed, in, the, ark, of, the, covenant, thomas, r, mer, argued, in, 2015, that, clearly, the, tablets, of, the, law, are, a, substitute, for, something, else, he, holds, that, the, original, ark, contained, a, statue, of, yhwh, and, that, it, was, brought, into, the, jerusalem, temple, under, josiah, 3, 9, which, he, specifically, identifies, as, two, betyles, sacred, stones, or, two, cult, image, statues, symbolizing, yhwh, and, his, female, companion, ashera, or, a, statue, representing, yhwh, alone, exodus, 34, 28, identifies, a, different, list, that, of, exodus, 34, 11, 27, as, the, ten, commandments, since, this, passage, does, not, prohibit, murder, adultery, theft, etc, but, instead, deals, with, the, proper, worship, of, yahweh, some, scholars, call, it, the, ritual, decalogue, and, disambiguate, the, ten, commandments, of, traditional, understanding, as, the, ethical, decalogue, the, documentary, hypothesis, identifies, the, ritual, decalogue, as, the, work, of, the, jahwist, from, the, kingdom, of, judah, and, the, covenant, code, as, that, of, the, elohist, from, the, kingdom, of, israel, both, writing, independently, it, does, not, however, answer, the, question, of, how, these, texts, were, related, merely, that, the, ritual, decalogue, circulated, in, judah, and, the, covenant, code, in, israel, what, the, documentary, hypothesis, does, partly, explain, is, the, relationship, of, the, ritual, decalogue, to, the, ethical, decalogue, and, why, instead, of, the, ethical, decalogue, it, is, the, ritual, decalogue, which, is, written, on, the, two, tablets, when, moses, ascends, the, mountain, to, have, the, ethical, decalogue, inscribed, for, a, second, time, richard, elliott, friedman, argues, that, the, ten, commandments, at, exodus, 20, 1, 17, does, not, appear, to, belong, to, any, of, the, major, sources, it, is, likely, to, be, an, independent, document, which, was, inserted, here, by, the, redactor, in, his, view, the, covenant, code, follows, that, version, of, the, ten, commandments, in, the, northern, israel, e, narrative, in, the, j, narrative, in, exodus, 34, the, editor, of, the, combined, story, known, as, the, redactor, or, rje, adds, in, an, explanation, that, these, are, a, replacement, for, the, earlier, tablets, which, were, shattered, in, the, combined, je, text, it, would, be, awkward, to, picture, god, just, commanding, moses, to, make, some, tablets, as, if, there, were, no, history, to, this, matter, so, rje, adds, the, explanation, that, these, are, a, replacement, for, the, earlier, tablets, that, were, shattered, he, suggests, that, differences, in, the, j, and, e, versions, of, the, ten, commandments, story, are, a, result, of, power, struggles, in, the, priesthood, the, writer, has, moses, smash, the, tablets, because, this, raised, doubts, about, the, judah, s, central, religious, shrine, according, to, some, scholars, certain, interpretations, of, the, commandments, were, allegedly, problematic, for, people, living, in, those, respective, societies, during, their, time, like, capital, punishment, for, blasphemy, idolatry, apostasy, adultery, cursing, one, own, s, parents, and, sabbath, breaking, during, an, 1846, uprising, now, known, as, the, galician, slaughter, by, impoverished, and, famished, galician, eastern, european, peasants, serfs, directed, against, szlachta, polish, nobles, because, of, their, oppression, for, example, manorial, prisons, a, popular, rumor, had, it, that, the, austrian, emperor, had, abolished, the, ten, commandants, which, the, peasants, took, as, permission, and, religious, justification, to, massacre, the, szlachta, the, prime, representatives, and, beneficiaries, of, the, crown, in, austrian, galicia, this, uprising, is, credited, with, helping, to, bring, on, the, demise, in, 1848, of, serfdom, with, corv, e, labor, in, galicia, european, protestants, replaced, some, visual, art, in, their, churches, with, plaques, of, the, ten, commandments, after, the, reformation, in, england, such, decalogue, boards, also, represented, the, english, monarch, s, emphasis, on, rule, of, royal, law, within, the, churches, the, united, states, constitution, forbids, establishment, of, religion, by, law, however, images, of, moses, holding, the, tablets, of, the, decalogue, along, other, religious, figures, including, solomon, confucius, and, muhammad, holding, the, quran, are, sculpted, on, the, north, and, south, friezes, of, the, pediment, of, the, supreme, court, building, in, washington, images, of, the, ten, commandments, have, long, been, contested, symbols, for, the, relationship, of, religion, to, national, law, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, fraternal, order, of, eagles, placed, possibly, thousands, of, ten, commandments, displays, in, courthouses, and, school, rooms, including, many, stone, monuments, on, courthouse, property, because, displaying, the, commandments, can, reflect, a, sectarian, position, if, they, are, numbered, the, eagles, developed, an, ecumenical, version, that, omitted, the, numbers, as, on, the, monument, at, the, texas, capitol, hundreds, of, monuments, were, also, placed, by, director, cecil, b, demille, as, a, publicity, stunt, to, promote, his, 1956, film, the, ten, commandments, placing, the, plaques, and, monuments, to, the, ten, commandments, in, and, around, government, buildings, was, another, expression, of, mid, twentieth, century, u, s, civil, religion, along, with, adding, the, phrase, under, god, to, the, pledge, of, allegiance, by, the,
