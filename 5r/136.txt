china, and, imperial, china, to, legitimize, the, rule, of, the, king, or, emperor, of, china, according, to, this, doctrine, heaven, tian, bestows, its, mandate, on, a, virtuous, ruler, this, ruler, the, son, of, heaven, was, the, supreme, universal, monarch, who, ruled, tianxia, all, under, heaven, the, world, if, a, ruler, was, overthrown, this, was, interpreted, as, an, indication, that, the, ruler, was, unworthy, and, had, lost, the, mandate, it, was, also, a, common, belief, that, natural, disasters, such, as, famine, and, flood, were, divine, retributions, bearing, signs, of, heaven, s, displeasure, with, the, ruler, so, there, would, often, be, revolts, following, major, disasters, as, the, people, saw, these, calamities, as, signs, that, the, mandate, of, heaven, had, been, withdrawn, the, mandate, of, heaven, does, not, require, a, legitimate, ruler, to, be, of, noble, birth, depending, instead, on, how, well, that, person, can, rule, chinese, dynasties, such, as, the, han, and, ming, were, founded, by, men, of, common, origins, but, they, were, seen, as, having, succeeded, because, they, had, gained, the, mandate, of, heaven, retaining, the, mandate, is, contingent, on, the, just, and, able, performance, of, the, rulers, and, their, heirs, corollary, to, the, concept, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, was, the, right, of, rebellion, against, an, unjust, ruler, the, mandate, of, heaven, was, often, invoked, by, philosophers, and, scholars, in, china, as, a, way, to, curtail, the, abuse, of, power, by, the, ruler, in, a, system, that, had, few, other, checks, chinese, historians, interpreted, a, successful, revolt, as, evidence, that, heaven, had, withdrawn, its, mandate, from, the, ruler, throughout, chinese, history, times, of, poverty, and, natural, disasters, were, often, taken, as, signs, that, heaven, considered, the, incumbent, ruler, unjust, and, thus, in, need, of, replacement, the, concept, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, also, extends, to, the, ruler, s, family, having, divine, rights, and, was, first, used, to, support, the, rule, of, the, kings, of, the, zhou, dynasty, to, legitimize, their, overthrow, of, the, earlier, shang, dynasty, it, was, used, throughout, the, history, of, china, to, legitimize, the, successful, overthrow, and, installation, of, new, emperors, including, by, non, han, dynasties, such, as, the, qing, dynasty, the, mandate, of, heaven, has, been, called, the, zhou, dynasty, s, most, important, contribution, to, chinese, political, thought, but, it, coexisted, and, interfaced, with, other, theories, of, sovereign, legitimacy, including, abdication, to, the, worthy, and, five, phases, theory, the, prosperous, shang, dynasty, saw, its, rule, filled, with, multiple, outstanding, accomplishments, notably, the, dynasty, lasted, for, a, considerable, time, during, which, 31, kings, ruled, over, an, extended, period, of, 17, generations, the, rule, of, the, shang, kings, has,

inscription, on, the, da, yu, ding, employ, language, more, descriptive, than, theoretical, the, great, command, in, the, sky, although, both, the, shang, and, zhou, claimed, divine, ancestry, the, zhou, were, the, first, to, use, the, concept, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, to, explain, their, right, to, assume, rule, and, presumed, that, the, only, way, to, hold, the, mandate, was, to, rule, well, in, the, eyes, of, heaven, they, also, stated, that, the, shang, came, into, power, because, the, xia, had, lost, their, mandate, which, had, then, been, bestowed, upon, the, shang, leading, to,

house, to, take, over, the, overthrow, of, the, shang, dynasty, they, said, was, in, accordance, with, the, mandate, given, by, heaven, even, at, the, time, of, the, inauguration, ritual, of, third, generation, king, kang, of, zhou, the, royal, command, read, out, to, the, new, king, explicitly, stated, the, belief, that, heaven, had, changed, its, mandate, in, the, political, theory, of, the,

his, heirs, early, on, in, the, dynasty, there, was, some, debate, as, to, whether, heaven, s, mandate, had, fallen, to, the, senior, sons, of, king, wen, s, line, or, to, the, house, of, zhou, as, a, group, as, exemplified, by, an, exchange, surviving, in, the, classic, book, of, documents, the, zhou, dynasty, was, marked, by, early, success, and, expansion, until, the, death, on, campaign, of, king, kang, s, successor, king, zhao, of, zhou, during, the, ensuing, centuries, central, authority, waned, overall, driven, by, socioeconomic, pressures, this, culminated, in, a, succession, crisis, which, saw, the, aristocracy, split, between, two, competing, candidates, for, a, number, of, years, when, the, crisis, resolved, the, royal, house, retained, only, a, tiny, amount, of, land, and, no, real, military, power, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, eastern, zhou, during, the, decline, of, the, royal, house, although, real, power, was, wrested, from, their, grasp, their, divine, legitimacy, was, not, brought, into, question, and, even, with, the, king, reduced, to, something, of, a, figurehead, his, prestige, remained, supreme, as, heaven, s, eldest, son, however, there, is, epigraphic, evidence, that, in, private, the, rulers, of, the, state, of, qin, which, would, go, on, to, conquer, everyone, else, and, become, the, first, dynasty, of, the, imperial, era, held, that, their, ancestors, had, received, heaven, s, mandate, as, early, as, the, 600s, bce, multiple, inscriptions, attest, to, this, idea, it, is, unclear, whether, the, qin, rulers, meant, they, believed, they, had, celestial, approval, to, replace, the, zhou, kings, whether, they, believed, themselves, the, appointed, heirs, of, the, zhou, should, the, royal, line, come, to, an, end, or, whether, their, receipt, of, heaven, s, mandate, was, construed, as, issuing, through, the, zhou, king, to, give, them, legitimate, authority, over, their, own, lands, when, the, zhou, dynasty, did, come, to, an, end, qin, absorbed, the, remainder, of, their, lands, as, well, as, those, of, all, their, competitors, the, mandate, of, heaven, did, not, play, a, direct, part, in, their, public, relations,

soldiers, ambitious, minor, officials, and, remnants, of, the, recently, defeated, aristocracy, rapidly, downfell, the, central, government, the, ensuing, chu, han, contention, ended, with, the, success, of, liu, bang, and, establishment, of, the, han, dynasty, surviving, historical, documents, from, the, han, dynasty, paint, the, preceding, qin, in, a, deeply, unfavourable, light, emphasising, tyrannical, policies, the, incompetence, of, the, second, emperor, and, giving, an, account, of, illegitimate, birth, for, the, first, emperor, in, this, portrayal, it, is, clear, the, qin, had, lost, the, mandate, if, they, had, ever, possessed, it, to, begin, with, it, was, an, uncomfortable, fact, that, han, founder, liu, bang, rose, to, power, from, a, background, outside, the, aristocracy, and, achieved, victory, through, military, accomplishments, to, accommodate, this, liu, bang, was, ascribed, a, magical, birth, and, later, a, divine, ancestry, when, wang, mang, took, power, at, the, end, of, the, western, han, he, used, the, acceptance, of, the, theory, of, heaven, s, mandate, to, his, advantage, auspicious, unusual, events, were, said, to, portend, heaven, s, choosing, a, new, heir, so, wang, fabricated, omens, indicating, that, heaven, had, changed, its, mandate, and, that, it, had, chosen, him, following, the, restoration, of, the, han, house, to, power, the, mandate, of, heaven, stood, on, uncertain, grounds, some, theorists, decoupled, judgements, of, virtue, from, the, mandate, seeing, it, primarily, as, inherited, through, ancestry, while, others, abandoned, the, concept, altogether, in, favour, of, five, phases, theories, the, final, han, emperor, abdicated, to, the, powerful, minister, cao, pi, in, ce, 220, and, in, this, transfer, of, power, the, idea, of, heaven, s, mandate, played, a, large, role, the, court, prognosticator, xu, zhi, enumerated, in, a, lengthy, memorandum, the, signs, he, had, located, in, divinatory, and, historical, texts, showing, that, cao, pi, s, wei, should, succeed, the, han, a, sequence, of, written, statements, by, various, officials, followed, culminating, in, emperor, xian, of, han, s, formal, announcement, of, abdication, and, cao, pi, s, accession, the, announcement, of, abdication, explicitly, mentioned, that, the, mandate, of, heaven, was, not, permanent, and, no, one, argued, that, the, virtue, of, the, house, of, han, had, not, been, in, decline, for, some, time, in, the, eyes, of, these, authors, heaven, s, mandate, followed, virtue, while, the, idea, that, cao, wei, was, heaven, s, legitimate, successor, predominated, for, several, centuries, the, alternate, theory, that, heaven, s, mandate, instead, fell, to, the, rival, state, of, shu, han, was, first, articulated, by, xi, zuochi, in, the, 300s, and, was, universally, accepted, by, the, much, later, song, dynasty, the, last, wei, emperor, abdicated, in, turn, to, the, western, jin, this, dynasty, soon, lost, control, of, northern, china, to, non, han, ethnic, groups, and, in, the, literature, of, the, southern, dynasties, that, followed, there, began, to, appear, an, object, called, the, state, transmitting, seal, this, magical, talisman, was, the, physical, manifestation, of, heaven, s, mandate, tied, up, in, the, fortunes, of, ruling, families, allowing, the, exiled, southern, aristocracy, to, retain, their, sense, of, cultural, superiority, and, maintain, the, validity, of, heaven, s, mandate, in, the, face, of, counterfactual, political, reality, during, the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, period, there, was, no, dominant, chinese, dynasty, that, ruled, all, of, china, this, created, a, problem, for, the, song, dynasty, that, followed, as, they, wanted, to, legitimize, their, rule, by, establishing, a, clear, transmission, of, the, mandate, from, the, tang, through, to, the, song, the, scholar, official, xue, juzheng, compiled, the, old, history, of, the, five, dynasties, during, the, 960s, and, 970s, after, the, song, dynasty, had, taken, northern, china, from, the, last, of, the, five, dynasties, the, later, zhou, a, major, purpose, of, the, book, was, to, establish, justification, for, the, transference, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, through, these, five, dynasties, and, thus, to, the, song, dynasty, he, argued, that, these, dynasties, met, certain, vital, criteria, to, be, considered, as, having, attained, the, mandate, of, heaven, despite, never, having, ruled, all, of, china, one, is, that, they, all, ruled, the, traditional, chinese, heartland, however, there, were, certain, other, areas, where, these, dynasties, all, clearly, fell, short, the, brutal, behavior, of, zhu, wen, and, his, later, liang, was, a, source, of, considerable, embarrassment, and, thus, there, was, pressure, to, exclude, them, from, the, mandate, the, following, three, dynasties, the, later, tang, later, jin, and, later, han, were, all, non, han, chinese, dynasties, with, rulers, from, the, shatuo, ethnic, minority, additionally, none, of, them, were, able, to, defeat, the, powerful, states, to, the, south, and, unify, the, entire, chinese, realm, however, xue, juzheng, concluded, that, the, mandate, had, indeed, passed, through, each, of, the, five, dynasties, and, thus, onto, the, song, dynasty, when, it, conquered, the, last, of, those, dynasties, the, mandate, of, heaven, was, thought, to, emanate, from, the, dao, especially, in, the, song, dynasty, the, qing, dynasty, was, established, by, the, manchus, who, conquered, the, china, proper, nurhaci, who, was, regarded, the, founding, father, of, the, qing, dynasty, was, originally, a, vassalage, to, the, ming, dynasty, and, later, rebelled, against, the, ming, with, the, seven, grievances, but, according, to, the, qing, rulers, it, was, the, peasant, rebels, led, by, li, zicheng, who, overthrew, the, ming, and, so, the, qing, were, not, responsible, for, the, destruction, of, the, ming, dynasty, instead, the, qing, argued, they, had, obtained, the, mandate, of, heaven, by, defeating, the, many, rebels, and, bandits, that, the, ming, had, failed, to, control, and, restoring, stability, to, the, empire, just, as, stability, was, a, sign, of, heaven, s, favor, difficulties, were, a, sign, of, heaven, s, displeasure, thus, emperors, in, the, qing, and, earlier, dynasties, often, interpreted, natural, disasters, during, their, reigns, as, reasons, to, reflect, on, their, failures, to, act, and, govern, correctly, mencius, stated, that, the, people, are, of, supreme, importance, the, altars, of, soil, and, grain, come, next, last, comes, the, ruler, that, is, why, he, who, gains, the, confidence, of, the, multitudinous, people, will, be, emperor, when, a, local, lord, endangers, the, altars, of, soil, and, grain, he, should, be, replaced, when, the, sacrificial, animals, are, sleek, the, offerings, are, clean, and, the, sacrifices, are, observed, at, due, times, and, yet, floods, and, droughts, come, then, the, altars, should, be, replaced, thus, the, mandate, of, heaven, does, not, confer, an, unconditional, right, to, rule, to, retain, the, mandate, of, heaven, a, ruler, s, performance, had, to, be, just, and, effective, and, not, excessively, expand, and, maintain, power, outside, the, nation, s, borders, the, people, retained, a, right, to, rebel, 39, of, the, political, philosophers, of, the, warring, states, period, mencius, was, perhaps, the, most, radically, revolutionary, deliberately, eliding, any, distinction, between, overthrowing, a, wicked, ruler, and, punishing, a, common, criminal, the, more, conservative, xunzi, writing, not, much, later, regarded, rebellion, as, the, apical, manifestation, of, an, unfit, ruler, s, ineptitude, only, justified, if, already, inevitable, meanwhile, the, authoritarian, han, feizi, rejected, entirely, the, concept, of, a, just, rebellion, going, as, far, as, denouncing, such, culture, heroes, as, tang, of, shang, and, wu, of, zhou, rebels, who, founded, successful, empires, by, the, time, of, the, han, dynasty, the, right, to, rebellion, was, a, politically, sensitive, topic, as, the, han, rulers, could, neither, deny, their, own, history, as, being, birthed, in, rebellion, nor, embrace, the, idea, that, they, should, themselves, be, overthrown, the, right, of, rebellion, against, an, unjust, ruler, has, been, a, part, of, chinese, political, philosophy, ever, since, the, zhou, dynasty, and, the, successful, rebellion, was, interpreted, by, chinese, historians, as, evidence, that, divine, approval, had, passed, on, to, the, successive, dynasty, the, right, of, rebellion, is, not, coded, into, any, official, law, rather, rebellion, is, always, outlawed, and, severely, punished, but, is, still, a, positive, right, grounded, in, the, chinese, moral, system, often, it, is, used, as, a, justification, for, actions, to, overthrow, a, previous, dynasty, after, a, rebellion, has, been, successful, and, a, new, dynastic, rule, has, been, established, since, the, winner, is, the, one, who, determines, who, has, obtained, the, mandate, of, heaven, and, who, has, lost, it, some, chinese, scholars, consider, it, to, be, a, sort, of, victor, s, justice, best, characterized, in, the, popular, chinese, saying, the, winner, becomes, king, the, loser, becomes, outlaw, chinese, due, to, this, it, is, considered, that, chinese, historical, accounts, of, the, fall, of, a, dynasty, and, the, rise, of, a, new, one, must, be, handled, with, caution, chinese, traditional, historical, compilation, methods, produce, accounts, that, tend, to, fit, their, account, to, the, theory, emphasizing, aspects, tending, to, prove, that, the, old, dynasty, lost, the, mandate, of, heaven, and, the, new, one, gained, it, and, de, emphasizing, other, aspects, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, confucianist, elements, of, student, rebellions, often, claimed, the, mandate, of, heaven, has, been, forfeited, as, demonstrated, by, their, large, scale, activism, with, notable, instances, including, the, 2014, sunflower, student, movement, in, taiwan, and, the, 2014, and, 2019, hong, kong, protests, in, imperial, times, chinese, emperors, invoked, de, by, striving, to, be, good, influences, and, performing, rituals, to, benefit, their, status, and, keep, the, mandate, of, heaven, also, the, mandate, could, not, be, given, to, several, emperors, or, rulers, at, once, because, of, china, s, influence, in, medieval, times, the, concept, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, spread, to, other, east, asian, countries, as, a, justification, for, rule, by, divine, political, legitimacy, in, korea, the, kingdom, of, goguryeo, one, of, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, adopted, the, chinese, concept, of, tianxia, which, was, based, on, mandate, of, heaven, however, in, goguryeo, it, was, changed, to, be, based, on, divine, ancestry, in, the, goguryeo, story, jumong, was, born, to, hye, moss, the, son, of, the, emperor, and, yu, hwa, the, daughter, of, habaek, the, god, of, water, when, yuhwa, was, pregnant, she, entrusted, her, body, to, the, king, of, buyeo, and, laid, an, egg, and, the, person, who, came, out, of, the, egg, was, jumong, when, jumong, who, was, born, of, eggs, grew, up, and, performed, various, strange, tricks, the, sons, of, king, buyeo, became, jealous, and, jumong, eventually, fled, buyeo, and, built, a, country, called, goguryeo, this, is, a, case, in, which, goguryeo, claimed, the, legitimacy, of, expelling, buyeo, under, the, command, of, heaven, by, setting, him, as, the, son, of, god, silla, is, similar, to, goguryeo, according, to, silla, s, founding, story, there, was, no, king, in, the, area, where, silla, was, located, but, the, sixth, degree, and, its, sixth, degree, held, a, meeting, of, painters, and, ruled, they, wanted, a, monarchy, in, which, a, king, existed, rather, than, the, current, political, system, but, one, day, they, found, an, egg, near, a, well, and, one, was, born, out, of, it, it, is, said, that, the, village, chiefs, named, him, park, hyuk, geose, and, appointed, him, king, to, create, the, present, silla, the, earliest, records, are, from, joseon, dynasty, which, made, the, mandate, of, heaven, an, enduring, state, ideology, the, ideology, was, also, adopted, in, vietnam, known, in, vietnamese, as, thi, n, m, nh, ch, h, n, a, divine, mandate, gave, the, vietnamese, emperor, the, right, to, rule, based, not, on, his, lineage, but, on, his, competence, to, govern, the, later, and, more, centralized, vietnamese, dynasties, adopted, confucianism, as, the, state, ideology, which, led, to, the, creation, of, a, vietnamese, tributary, system, in, southeast, asia, that, was, modeled, after, the, chinese, sinocentric, system, in, east, asia, in, japan, the, title, son, of, heaven, was, interpreted, literally, where, the, monarch, was, referred, to, as, a, demigod, deity, or, living, god, chosen, by, the, gods, and, goddesses, of, heaven, eventually, the, japanese, government, found, the, concept, ideologically, problematic, preferring, not, to, have, divine, political, legitimacy, that, was, conditional, and, that, could, be, withdrawn, the, japanese, taih, code, formulated, in, 703, was, largely, an, adaptation, of, the, governmental, system, of, the, tang, dynasty, but, the, mandate, of, heaven, was, specifically, omitted
