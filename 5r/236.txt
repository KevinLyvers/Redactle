https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_in_Christianity
in, western, christian, theology, grace, is, created, by, god, who, gives, it, as, help, to, one, because, god, desires, one, to, have, it, not, necessarily, because, of, anything, one, has, done, to, earn, it, it, is, understood, by, western, christians, to, be, a, spontaneous, gift, from, god, to, people, generous, free, and, totally, unexpected, and, undeserved, that, takes, the, form, of, divine, favor, love, clemency, and, a, share, in, the, divine, life, of, god, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, grace, is, the, uncreated, energies, of, god, among, eastern, christians, generally, grace, is, considered, to, be, the, partaking, of, the, divine, nature, described, in, 2, peter, 1, 4, and, grace, is, the, working, of, god, himself, not, a, created, substance, of, any, kind, that, can, be, treated, like, a, commodity, as, an, attribute, of, god, it, manifests, most, in, the, salvation, of, sinners, and, western, christianity, holds, that, the, initiative, in, the, relationship, of, grace, between, god, and, an, individual, is, always, on, the, side, of, god, the, question, of, the, means, of, grace, has, been, called, the, watershed, that, divides, catholicism, from, protestantism, calvinism, from, arminianism, modern, theological, liberalism, from, theological, conservatism, the, catholic, church, holds, that, it, is, because, of, the, action, of, christ, and, the, holy, spirit, in, transforming, into, the, divine, life, what, is, subjected, to, god, s, power, that, the, sacraments, confer, the, grace, they, signify, the, power, of, christ, and, his, spirit, acts, in, and, through, independently, of, the, personal, holiness, of, the, minister, nevertheless, the, fruits, of, the, sacraments, also, depend, on, the, disposition, of, the, one, who, receives, them, the, sacred, mysteries, sacraments, are, seen, as, a, means, of, partaking, of, divine, grace, because, god, works, through, his, church, catholics, eastern, orthodox, and, protestants, agree, that, faith, is, a, gift, from, god, as, in, ephesians, 2, 8, for, by, grace, you, have, been, saved, through, faith, and, that, not, of, yourselves, it, is, the, gift, of, god, lutherans, hold, that, the, means, of, grace, are, the, gospel, in, word, and, sacraments, that, the, sacraments, are, means, of, grace, is, also, the, teaching, of, john, wesley, who, described, the, eucharist, as, the, grand, channel, whereby, the, grace, of, his, spirit, was, conveyed, to, the, souls, of, all, the, children, of, god, calvinists, emphasize, the, utter, helplessness, of, people, apart, from, grace, but, god, reaches, out, with, first, grace, or, prevenient, grace, the, calvinist, doctrine, known, as, irresistible, grace, states, that, since, all, persons, are, by, nature, spiritually, dead, no, one, desires, to, accept, this, grace, until, god, spiritually, enlivens, them, by, means, of, regeneration, god, regenerates, only, individuals, whom, he, has, predestined, to, salvation, arminians, understand, the, grace, of, god, as, cooperating, with, one, s, free, will, in, order, to, bring, an, individual, to, salvation, according, to, evangelical, theologian, charles, c, ryrie, modern, liberal, theology, gives, an, exaggerated, place, to, the, abilities, of, people, to, decide, their, own, fate, and, to, effect, their, own, salvation, entirely, apart, from, god, s, grace, grace, is, the, english, translation, of, the, greek, charis, meaning, that, which, brings, delight, joy, happiness, or, good, fortune, the, septuagint, translates, as, the, hebrew, word, en, as, found, in, genesis, 6, 8, to, describe, why, god, saved, noah, from, the, flood, the, old, testament, use, of, the, word, includes, the, concept, that, those, showing, favor, do, gracious, deeds, or, acts, of, grace, such, as, being, kind, to, the, poor, and, showing, generosity, descriptions, of, god, s, graciousness, abound, in, the, torah, pentateuch, for, example, in, deuteronomy, 7, 8, and, numbers, 6, 24, 27, in, the, psalms, examples, of, god, s, grace, include, teaching, the, law, psalm, 119, 29, and, answering, prayers, psalm, 27, 7, another, example, of, god, s, grace, appears, in, psalm, 85, a, prayer, for, restoration, forgiveness, and, the, grace, and, mercy, of, god, to, bring, about, new, life, following, the, exile, in, the, definition, of, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, grace, is, favour, the, free, and, undeserved, help, that, god, gives, us, to, respond, to, his, call, to, become, children, of, god, adoptive, sons, partakers, of, the, divine, nature, and, of, eternal, life, grace, is, a, participation, in, the, life, of, god, which, is, poured, unearned, into, human, beings, whom, it, heals, of, sin, and, sanctifies, the, means, by, which, god, grants, grace, are, many, they, include, the, entirety, of, revealed, truth, the, sacraments, and, the, hierarchical, ministry, among, the, principal, means, of, grace, are, the, sacraments, especially, the, eucharist, prayers, and, good, works, the, sacramentals, also, are, means, of, grace, the, sacraments, themselves, not, the, persons, who, administer, or, those, who, receive, them, are, the, means, of, grace, although, lack, of, the, required, dispositions, on, the, part, of, the, recipient, will, block, the, effectiveness, of, the, sacrament, the, catholic, church, holds, that, by, grace, alone, in, faith, in, christ, s, saving, work, and, not, because, of, any, merit, on, our, part, we, are, accepted, by, god, and, receive, the, holy, spirit, who, renews, our, hearts, while, equipping, and, calling, us, to, good, works, both, the, council, of, orange, 529, and, the, council, of, trent, affirmed, that, we, are, justified, gratuitously, because, none, of, the, things, that, precede, justification, whether, faith, or, works, merit, the, grace, of, justification, the, council, of, trent, declared, that, the, free, will, of, man, moved, and, excited, by, god, can, by, its, consent, co, operate, with, god, who, excites, and, invites, its, action, and, that, it, can, thereby, dispose, and, prepare, itself, to, obtain, the, grace, of, justification, the, will, can, resist, grace, if, it, chooses, it, is, not, like, a, lifeless, thing, which, remains, purely, passive, weakened, and, diminished, by, adam, s, fall, free, will, is, yet, not, destroyed, in, the, race, sess, vi, cap, i, and, v, the, joint, declaration, between, catholics, and, lutherans, on, the, doctrine, of, justification, affirms, we, confess, together, that, all, persons, depend, completely, on, the, saving, grace, of, god, for, their, salvation, justification, takes, place, solely, by, god, s, grace, when, catholics, say, that, persons, cooperate, in, preparing, for, and, accepting, justification, by, consenting, to, god, s, justifying, action, they, see, such, personal, consent, as, itself, an, effect, of, grace, not, as, an, action, arising, from, innate, human, abilities, according, to, a, commonly, accepted, categorization, made, by, st, thomas, aquinas, in, his, summa, theologiae, grace, can, be, given, either, to, make, the, person, receiving, it, pleasing, to, god, gratia, gratum, faciens, so, that, the, person, is, sanctified, and, justified, or, else, to, help, the, receiver, lead, someone, else, to, god, gratia, gratis, data, the, former, type, of, grace, gratia, gratum, faciens, in, turn, can, be, described, as, sanctifying, or, habitual, grace, when, it, refers, to, the, divine, life, which, according, to, the, church, infuses, a, person, s, soul, once, they, are, justified, or, else, as, actual, grace, when, it, refers, to, those, punctual, not, habitual, helps, that, are, directed, to, the, production, of, sanctifying, grace, where, it, does, not, already, exist, or, its, maintenance, and, increase, it, where, it, is, already, present, according, to, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, sanctifying, grace, is, an, habitual, gift, a, stable, and, supernatural, disposition, that, perfects, the, soul, itself, to, enable, it, to, live, with, god, to, act, by, his, love, habitual, grace, the, permanent, disposition, to, live, and, act, in, keeping, with, god, s, call, is, distinguished, from, actual, graces, which, refer, to, god, s, interventions, whether, at, the, beginning, of, conversion, or, in, the, course, of, the, work, of, sanctification, the, infusion, of, sanctifying, grace, says, the, church, transforms, a, sinner, into, a, holy, child, of, god, and, in, this, way, a, person, participates, in, the, divine, sonship, of, jesus, christ, and, receives, the, indwelling, of, the, holy, spirit, sanctifying, grace, remains, permanently, in, the, soul, as, long, as, one, does, not, reject, one, s, adopted, sonship, by, committing, a, mortal, sin, which, severs, one, s, friendship, with, god, less, serious, sins, venial, sin, although, they, allow, charity, to, subsist, they, offend, and, wound, it, however, god, is, infinitely, merciful, and, sanctifying, grace, can, always, be, restored, to, the, penitent, heart, normatively, in, the, sacrament, of, reconciliation, or, sacrament, of, penance, in, the, early, 5th, century, pelagius, an, ascetic, who, is, said, to, have, come, from, britain, was, concerned, about, the, moral, laxity, of, society, that, he, witnessed, in, rome, he, blamed, this, laxity, on, the, theology, of, divine, grace, preached, by, augustine, of, hippo, among, others, he, strongly, affirmed, that, humans, had, free, will, and, were, able, to, choose, good, as, well, as, evil, augustine, drawing, on, the, exaggerated, statements, of, the, followers, of, pelagius, rather, than, on, pelagius, own, writings, began, a, debate, that, was, to, have, long, reaching, effects, on, subsequent, developments, of, the, doctrine, in, western, christianity, pelagianism, was, repudiated, by, the, council, of, carthage, in, 418, largely, at, augustine, s, insistence, however, what, pelagius, taught, was, likely, what, has, come, to, be, called, semi, pelagianism, in, semi, pelagian, thought, both, god, and, the, human, person, always, participate, in, the, salvation, process, humans, make, free, will, choices, which, are, aided, by, god, through, creation, natural, grace, supernatural, grace, and, god, s, restrictions, on, demonic, influences, god, continually, brings, the, human, person, to, real, choices, which, god, also, aids, in, the, process, of, spiritual, growth, and, salvation, semi, pelagianism, is, similar, to, synergism, which, is, the, traditional, patristic, doctrine, john, cassian, in, continuity, with, patristic, doctrine, taught, that, though, grace, is, required, for, persons, to, save, themselves, at, the, beginning, there, is, no, such, thing, as, total, depravity, but, there, remains, a, moral, or, noetic, ability, within, humans, that, is, unaffected, by, original, sin, and, that, persons, must, work, together, synergism, with, divine, grace, to, be, saved, this, position, is, held, by, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, by, many, reformed, protestants, and, in, the, catholic, church, has, been, especially, associated, with, the, society, of, jesus, in, 1547, the, council, of, trent, which, sought, to, address, and, condemn, protestant, objections, aimed, to, purge, the, roman, catholic, church, of, controversial, movements, and, establish, an, orthodox, roman, catholic, teaching, on, grace, and, justification, as, distinguished, from, the, protestant, teachings, on, those, concepts, it, taught, that, justification, and, sanctification, are, elements, of, the, same, process, the, grace, of, justification, is, bestowed, through, the, merit, of, christ, s, passion, without, any, merits, on, the, part, of, the, person, justified, who, is, enabled, to, cooperate, only, through, the, grace, of, god, the, grace, of, justification, may, be, lost, through, mortal, sin, but, can, also, be, restored, by, the, sacrament, of, penance, the, sacraments, are, together, with, revealed, truth, the, principal, means, of, the, grace, a, treasury, of, grace, that, christ, has, merited, by, his, life, and, death, and, has, given, to, the, church, this, does, not, mean, that, other, groups, of, christians, have, no, treasury, of, grace, at, their, disposal, for, as, the, second, vatican, council, declared, many, elements, of, sanctification, and, of, truth, are, found, outside, of, the, catholic, church, s, visible, structure, at, about, the, same, time, that, calvinists, and, arminians, were, debating, the, meaning, of, grace, in, protestantism, in, catholicism, a, similar, debate, was, taking, place, between, the, jansenists, and, the, jesuits, cornelius, jansen, s, 1640, work, augustinus, sought, to, refocus, catholic, theology, on, the, themes, of, original, sin, human, depravity, the, necessity, of, divine, grace, and, predestination, as, he, found, them, in, the, works, of, augustine, the, jansenists, like, the, puritans, believed, themselves, to, be, members, of, a, gathered, church, called, out, of, worldly, society, and, banded, together, in, institutions, like, the, port, royal, convents, seeking, to, lead, lives, of, greater, spiritual, intensity, blaise, pascal, attacked, what, he, called, moral, laxity, in, the, casuistry, of, the, jesuits, jansenist, theology, remained, a, minority, party, within, catholicism, and, during, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, it, was, condemned, as, a, heresy, for, its, similarities, to, calvinism, though, its, style, remained, influential, in, ascetic, circles, citing, the, council, of, trent, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, with, regard, to, god, there, is, no, strict, right, to, any, merit, on, the, part, of, man, between, god, and, us, there, is, an, immeasurable, inequality, for, we, have, received, everything, from, him, our, creator, the, merit, of, man, before, god, in, the, christian, life, arises, from, the, fact, that, god, has, freely, chosen, to, associate, man, with, the, work, of, his, grace, the, fatherly, action, of, god, is, first, on, his, own, initiative, and, then, follows, man, s, free, acting, through, his, collaboration, so, that, the, merit, of, good, works, is, to, be, attributed, in, the, first, place, to, the, grace, of, god, then, to, the, faithful, man, s, merit, moreover, itself, is, due, to, god, for, his, good, actions, proceed, in, christ, from, the, predispositions, and, assistance, given, by, the, holy, spirit, the, charity, of, christ, is, the, source, in, us, of, all, our, merits, before, god, grace, by, uniting, us, to, christ, in, active, love, ensures, the, supernatural, quality, of, our, acts, and, consequently, their, merit, before, god, and, before, men, the, saints, have, always, had, a, lively, awareness, that, their, merits, were, pure, grace, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, grace, is, identified, with, the, uncreated, energies, of, god, among, eastern, christians, generally, grace, is, considered, to, be, the, partaking, of, the, divine, nature, described, in, 2, peter, 1, 4, the, holy, mysteries, latin, sacraments, are, seen, as, a, means, of, partaking, of, divine, grace, because, god, works, through, his, church, not, just, because, specific, legalistic, rules, are, followed, and, grace, is, the, working, of, god, himself, not, a, created, substance, of, any, kind, that, can, be, treated, like, a, commodity, orthodox, theologians, reject, augustine, s, formulation, of, original, sin, and, actively, oppose, the, content, and, implications, of, john, calvin, s, conceptions, of, total, depravity, and, irresistible, grace, characteristic, of, reformed, protestantism, as, well, as, the, thomistic, and, scholastic, theology, which, would, become, official, roman, catholic, pedagogy, until, the, second, vatican, council, eastern, christians, typically, view, scholasticism, and, similarly, discursive, systematic, theologies, as, rationalistic, corruptions, of, the, theology, of, the, cappadocian, and, early, desert, fathers, that, led, the, western, church, astray, into, heresy, orthodoxy, teaches, that, it, is, possible, and, necessary, for, the, human, will, to, cooperate, with, divine, grace, for, the, individual, to, be, saved, or, healed, from, the, disease, of, sin, this, cooperation, is, called, synergism, see, also, semipelagianism, and, monergism, so, that, humans, may, become, deified, in, conformity, to, the, divine, likeness, a, process, called, theosis, by, merging, with, the, uncreated, energies, of, god, revealed, to, the, senses, as, the, tabor, light, of, transfiguration, notably, through, a, method, of, prayer, called, hesychasm, in, the, works, of, john, cassian, c, 360, 435, ad, conference, xiii, recounts, how, the, wise, monk, chaeremon, of, whom, he, is, writing, responded, to, puzzlement, caused, by, his, own, statement, that, man, even, though, he, strive, with, all, his, might, for, a, good, result, yet, cannot, become, master, of, what, is, good, unless, he, has, acquired, it, simply, by, the, gift, of, divine, bounty, and, not, by, the, efforts, of, his, own, toil, chapter, 1, in, chapter, 11, cassian, presents, chaeremon, as, speaking, of, the, cases, of, paul, the, persecutor, and, matthew, the, publican, as, difficulties, for, those, who, say, the, beginning, of, free, will, is, in, our, own, power, and, the, cases, of, zaccheus, and, the, good, thief, on, the, cross, as, difficulties, for, those, who, say, the, beginning, of, our, free, will, is, always, due, to, the, inspiration, of, the, grace, of, god, chaeremon, thus, concludes, these, two, then, viz, the, grace, of, god, and, free, will, seem, opposed, to, each, other, but, really, are, in, harmony, and, we, gather, from, the, system, of, goodness, that, we, ought, to, have, both, alike, lest, if, we, withdraw, one, of, them, from, man, we, may, seem, to, have, broken, the, rule, of, the, church, s, faith, for, when, god, sees, us, inclined, to, will, what, is, good, he, meets, guides, and, strengthens, us, for, at, the, voice, of, thy, cry, as, soon, as, he, shall, hear, he, will, answer, thee, and, call, upon, me, he, says, in, the, day, of, tribulation, and, i, will, deliver, thee, and, thou, shalt, glorify, me, and, again, if, he, finds, that, we, are, unwilling, or, have, grown, cold, he, stirs, our, hearts, with, salutary, exhortations, by, which, a, good, will, is, either, renewed, or, formed, in, us, cassian, did, not, accept, the, idea, of, total, depravity, on, which, martin, luther, was, to, insist, he, taught, that, human, nature, is, fallen, or, depraved, but, not, totally, augustine, casiday, states, that, at, the, same, time, cassian, baldly, asserts, that, god, s, grace, not, human, free, will, is, responsible, for, everything, pertains, to, salvation, even, faith, cassian, pointed, out, that, people, still, have, moral, freedom, and, one, has, the, option, to, choose, to, follow, god, colm, luibh, id, says, that, according, to, cassian, there, are, cases, where, the, soul, makes, the, first, little, turn, but, according, to, casiday, s, interpretation, any, sparks, of, goodwill, that, may, exist, not, directly, caused, by, god, are, totally, inadequate, and, only, direct, divine, intervention, ensures, spiritual, progress, and, lauren, pristas, says, that, for, cassian, salvation, is, from, beginning, to, end, the, effect, of, god, s, grace, the, protestant, reformation, reacted, against, the, concepts, of, grace, and, merit, as, they, were, understood, in, late, medieval, catholic, theology, martin, luther, s, posting, of, his, ninety, five, theses, to, the, church, door, in, wittenberg, in, 1517, was, a, direct, consequence, of, the, perfunctory, sacramentalism, and, treasury, doctrines, of, the, medieval, church, the, act, was, precipitated, by, the, arrival, of, johann, tetzel, authorized, by, the, vatican, to, sell, indulgences, the, effectiveness, of, these, indulgences, was, predicated, on, the, doctrine, of, the, treasury, of, grace, proclaimed, by, pope, clement, vi, the, theory, was, that, merit, earned, by, acts, of, piety, could, augment, the, believer, s, store, of, sanctifying, grace, gifts, to, the, church, were, acts, of, piety, the, church, moreover, had, a, treasury, full, of, grace, above, and, beyond, what, was, needed, to, get, its, faithful, into, heaven, the, church, was, willing, to, part, with, some, of, its, surplus, in, exchange, for, earthly, gold, martin, luther, s, anger, against, this, practice, which, seemed, to, him, to, involve, the, purchase, of, salvation, began, a, swing, of, the, pendulum, back, towards, the, pauline, vision, of, grace, as, opposed, to, james, s, luther, taught, that, men, were, helpless, and, without, a, plea, before, god, s, justice, and, their, acts, of, piety, were, utterly, inadequate, before, his, infinite, holiness, were, god, only, just, and, not, merciful, everyone, would, go, to, hell, because, everyone, even, the, best, of, mankind, deserves, to, go, to, hell, mankind, s, inability, to, achieve, salvation, by, its, own, effort, suggests, that, even, the, best, intentions, are, somehow, tainted, by, mankind, s, sinful, nature, this, doctrine, is, sometimes, called, total, depravity, a, term, derived, from, calvinism, and, its, relatives, it, is, by, faith, alone, sola, fide, and, by, grace, alone, sola, gratia, that, men, are, saved, good, works, are, something, the, believers, should, undertake, out, of, gratitude, towards, their, savior, but, they, are, not, sufficient, for, salvation, and, cannot, earn, anyone, salvation, there, is, no, room, for, the, notion, of, merit, in, luther, s, doctrine, of, redemption, there, may, however, be, degrees, of, reward, for, the, redeemed, in, heaven, only, the, unearned, unmerited, grace, of, god, can, save, anyone, no, one, can, have, a, claim, of, entitlement, to, god, s, grace, and, it, is, only, by, his, generosity, that, salvation, is, even, possible, as, opposed, to, the, treasury, of, grace, from, which, believers, can, make, withdrawals, in, lutheranism, salvation, becomes, a, declaration, of, spiritual, bankruptcy, in, which, penitents, acknowledge, the, inadequacy, of, their, own, resources, and, trust, only, in, god, to, save, them, accepting, augustine, s, concern, for, legal, justification, as, the, base, metaphor, for, salvation, the, believers, are, not, so, much, made, righteous, in, lutheranism, as, they, are, considered, covered, by, christ, s, righteousness, acknowledging, that, they, have, no, power, to, make, themselves, righteous, the, penalty, for, their, sins, is, discharged, because, jesus, has, already, paid, for, it, with, his, blood, his, righteousness, is, credited, to, those, who, believe, in, and, thus, belong, to, him, calvin, and, luther, believed, free, will, does, not, co, operate, with, god, s, grace, which, according, to, them, cannot, be, rejected, see, monergism, the, lutheran, augsburg, confession, says, of, baptism, lutherans, teach, that, it, is, necessary, to, salvation, and, that, by, baptism, the, grace, of, god, is, offered, and, that, children, are, to, be, baptized, who, by, baptism, being, offered, to, god, are, received, into, god, s, favor, the, french, reformer, john, calvin, expanded, and, further, developed, these, augustinian, themes, in, his, systematic, institutes, of, the, christian, religion, in, 1536, the, logical, structure, of, calvinism, is, often, expressed, as, the, acronym, tulip, these, five, categories, do, not, comprise, calvinism, in, its, entirety, they, simply, encapsulate, its, central, definitive, doctrines, the, notion, that, god, has, foreordained, who, will, be, saved, is, generally, called, predestination, the, concept, of, predestination, peculiar, to, calvinism, double, predestination, in, conjunction, with, limited, atonement, is, the, most, controversial, expression, of, the, doctrine, according, to, reformed, theology, the, good, news, of, the, gospel, of, christ, is, that, god, has, freely, granted, the, gift, of, salvation, to, those, the, holy, spirit, causes, to, believe, what, he, freely, grants, to, some, the, elect, individuals, he, withholds, from, others, the, reprobate, individuals, calvin, sought, to, provide, assurance, to, the, faithful, that, god, would, actually, save, them, his, teaching, implied, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, doctrine, of, the, perseverance, of, the, saints, the, notion, that, god, would, actually, save, those, who, were, his, elect, the, actual, status, and, ultimate, state, of, any, man, s, soul, were, unknown, except, to, god, when, assurance, of, election, was, rigorously, pressed, as, an, experience, to, be, sought, especially, by, the, puritans, this, led, to, a, legalism, as, rigid, as, the, one, protestantism, sought, to, reject, as, men, were, eager, to, demonstrate, that, they, were, among, the, chosen, by, the, conspicuous, works, righteousness, of, their, lives, the, relatively, radical, positions, of, reformed, theology, provoked, a, strong, reaction, from, both, roman, catholics, and, lutherans, in, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, the, dutch, theologian, jacobus, arminius, formulated, arminianism, and, departed, from, calvin, s, theology, in, particular, on, election, and, predestination, arminianism, affirms, the, compatibility, between, human, free, will, and, divine, foreknowledge, and, its, incompatibility, with, theological, determinism, predestination, in, arminianism, is, based, on, divine, foreknowledge, unlike, in, calvinism, thus, the, offer, of, salvation, through, grace, does, not, act, irresistibly, in, a, purely, cause, effect, deterministic, method, but, rather, in, an, influence, and, response, fashion, that, can, be, both, freely, accepted, and, freely, denied, in, arminianism, god, takes, initiative, in, the, salvation, process, and, his, grace, comes, to, all, people, this, is, done, through, prevenient, grace, which, acts, on, all, people, to, convince, them, of, the, gospel, draw, them, strongly, towards, salvation, and, enable, the, possibility, of, sincere, faith, as, roger, olson, put, it, evangelical, synergism, reserves, all, the, power, ability, and, efficacy, in, salvation, to, grace, but, allows, humans, the, god, granted, ability, to, resist, or, not, resist, it, the, only, contribution, humans, make, is, nonresistance, to, grace, later, john, wesley, also, rejected, the, calvinist, doctrine, of, predestination, and, had, the, same, arminian, understanding, as, expressed, in, wesleyan, theology, it, remains, the, standard, teaching, of, methodist, churches, wesley, also, appealed, to, prevenient, grace, stating, that, god, makes, the, initial, move, in, salvation, but, human, beings, are, free, to, respond, or, reject, god, s, graceful, initiative, the, doctrine, of, prevenient, grace, remains, one, of, methodism, s, most, important, doctrines, john, wesley, distinguished, three, kinds, of, divine, grace, in, the, process, of, salvation, 1, prevenient, grace, which, is, an, enabling, grace, preceding, regeneration, prevenient, means, preceding, 2, justifying, grace, which, can, bring, regeneration, but, which, is, resistible, 3, sustaining, grace, which, helps, a, person, to, remain, into, regeneration, and, to, reach, sanctification, and, final, salvation, in, particular, wesley, taught, that, christian, believers, are, to, participate, in, the, means, of, grace, and, to, continue, to, grow, in, the, christian, life, assisted, by, god, s, sustaining, grace, protestantism, in, all, three, major, schools, of, theology, lutheran, calvinist, and, arminian, emphasize, god, s, initiative, in, the, work, of, salvation, which, is, achieved, by, grace, alone, through, faith, alone, in, either, stream, of, thinking, although, these, terms, are, understood, differently, according, to, the, differences, in, systems, classical, calvinism, teaches, that, the, sacraments, are, signs, and, seals, of, the, covenant, of, grace, and, effectual, means, of, salvation, and, lutheranism, teaches, that, new, life, faith, and, union, with, christ, are, granted, by, the, holy, spirit, working, through, the, sacraments, however, for, a, large, portion, of, the, protestant, world, the, sacraments, largely, lost, the, importance, that, luther, and, to, a, slightly, lesser, degree, calvin, attributed, to, them, this, happened, under, the, influence, of, ideas, of, the, anabaptists, which, were, ideas, also, seen, in, the, donatists, in, north, africa, in, 311, ad, and, these, ideas, then, spread, to, calvinists, through, the, congregationalist, and, baptist, movements, and, to, lutherans, through, pietism, although, much, of, lutheranism, recoiled, against, the, pietist, movement, after, the, mid, 19th, century, where, the, sacraments, are, de, emphasized, they, become, ordinances, acts, of, worship, which, are, required, by, scripture, but, whose, effect, is, limited, to, the, voluntary, effect, they, have, on, the, worshipper, s, soul, this, belief, finds, expression, in, the, baptist, and, anabaptist, practice, of, believer, s, baptism, given, not, to, infants, as, a, mark, of, membership, in, a, christian, community, but, to, adult, believers, after, they, have, achieved, the, age, of, reason, and, have, professed, their, faith, these, ordinances, are, never, considered, works, righteousness, the, ritual, as, interpreted, in, light, of, such, ideas, does, not, at, all, bring, about, salvation, nor, does, its, performance, bring, about, the, forgiveness, of, sins, the, forgiveness, which, the, believer, has, received, by, faith, is, merely, pictured, not, effectively, applied, by, baptism, salvation, and, participation, in, christ, is, memorialized, this, do, in, remembrance, of, me, in, the, lord, s, supper, and, baptism, picturing, a, christian, s, rebirth, as, death, to, sin, and, alive, in, christ, not, imparted, by, the, eucharist, the, church, to, the, baptists, becomes, an, assembly, of, true, believers, in, christ, jesus, who, gather, together, for, worship, and, fellowship, and, remembering, what, christ, did, for, them, the, churches, of, christ, believe, that, the, grace, of, god, that, saves, is, the, plan, of, salvation, rather, than, salvation, itself, this, plan, includes, two, parts, 1, the, perfect, life, death, burial, and, resurrection, of, jesus, the, christ, 2, the, gospel, new, testament, the, faith, concerning, ephesians, 2, 8, which, states, for, by, grace, are, ye, saved, through, faith, and, that, not, of, yourselves, it, is, the, gift, of, god, it, is, noted, that, the, word, it, is, a, pronoun, and, refers, back, to, a, noun, as, the, word, saved, is, a, verb, it, does, not, refer, to, saved, but, to, grace, giving, the, definition, of, grace, as, the, gift, of, god, furthermore, as, the, book, of, james, distinguishes, between, a, dead, faith, a, faith, without, works, and, a, living, faith, a, faith, accompanied, by, works, of, obedience, it, is, believed, that, god, s, gift, operates, through, an, individual, s, living, faith, resulting, in, that, individual, being, saved, the, galatians, were, removed, from, the, calling, of, the, gospel, galatians, 1, 6, 7, 2, thessalonians, 2, 14, unto, another, gospel, another, message, which, verse, 7, says, is, not, a, gospel, at, all, but, a, perversion, the, church, of, christ, believes, that, grace, provides, the, following, plan, which, if, followed, results, in, salvation
