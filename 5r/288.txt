traditional, vaishnavism, sanskrit, romanized, vai, avasamprad, ya, is, one, of, the, major, hindu, denominations, along, with, shaivism, shaktism, and, smartism, it, is, also, called, vishnuism, since, it, considers, vishnu, as, the, sole, supreme, being, leading, all, other, hindu, deities, that, is, mahavishnu, its, followers, are, called, vaishnavites, or, vaishnava, s, iast, vai, ava, and, it, includes, sub, sects, like, krishnaism, and, ramaism, which, consider, krishna, and, rama, as, the, supreme, beings, respectively, according, to, a, 2010, estimate, by, johnson, and, grim, vaishnavism, is, the, largest, hindu, sect, constituting, about, 641, million, or, 67, 6, of, hindus, the, ancient, emergence, of, vaishnavism, is, unclear, and, broadly, hypothesized, as, a, fusion, of, various, regional, non, vedic, religions, with, worship, of, vishnu, it, is, considered, a, merger, of, several, popular, non, vedic, theistic, traditions, particularly, the, bhagavata, cults, of, v, sudeva, krishna, and, gopala, krishna, as, well, as, narayana, developed, in, the, 7th, to, 4th, century, bce, it, was, integrated, with, the, vedic, god, vishnu, in, the, early, centuries, ce, and, finalized, as, vaishnavism, when, it, developed, the, avatar, doctrine, wherein, the, various, non, vedic, deities, are, revered, as, distinct, incarnations, of, the, supreme, god, vishnu, rama, krishna, narayana, kalki, hari, vithoba, venkateshvara, shrinathji, ranganatha, and, jagannath, are, among, the, names, of, popular, avatars, all, seen, as, different, aspects, of, the, same, supreme, being, the, vaishnavite, tradition, is, known, for, the, loving, devotion, to, an, avatar, of, vishnu, often, krishna, and, as, such, was, key, to, the, spread, of, the, bhakti, movement, in, indian, subcontinent, in, the, 2nd, millennium, ce, it, has, four, vedanta, schools, of, numerous, denominations, sampradaya, the, medieval, era, vishishtadvaita, school, of, ramanuja, the, dvaita, school, of, madhvacharya, the, dvaitadvaita, school, of, nimbarkacharya, and, the, shuddhadvaita, of, vallabhacharya, there, are, also, several, other, vishnu, traditions, ramananda, 14th, century, created, a, rama, oriented, movement, now, the, largest, monastic, group, in, asia, key, texts, in, vaishnavism, include, the, vedas, the, upanishads, the, bhagavad, gita, the, pancharatra, agama, texts, naalayira, divya, prabhandham, and, the, bhagavata, purana, the, ancient, emergence, of, vaishnavism, is, unclear, the, evidence, inconsistent, and, scanty, syncretism, of, various, traditions, resulted, in, vaishnavism, although, vishnu, was, a, vedic, solar, deity, he, is, mentioned, less, often, compared, to, agni, indra, and, other, vedic, deities, thereby, suggesting, that, he, had, a, minor, position, in, the, vedic, religion, according, to, dandekar, what, is, understood, today, as, vaishnavism, did, not, originate, in, vedism, at, all, but, emerged, from, the, merger, of, several, popular, theistic, traditions, which, developed, after, the, decline, of, brahmanism, at, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, closely, before, the, second, urbanisation, of, northern, india, in, the, 7th, to, 4th, century, bce, it, initially, formed, as, vasudevism, around, v, sudeva, a, deified, leader, of, the, vrishnis, and, one, of, the, vrishni, heroes, later, v, sudeva, was, amalgamated, with, krishna, the, deified, tribal, hero, and, religious, leader, of, the, yadavas, to, form, the, merged, deity, bhagavan, v, sudeva, krishna, due, to, the, close, relation, between, the, tribes, of, the, vrishnis, and, the, yadavas, this, was, followed, by, a, merger, with, the, cult, of, gopala, krishna, of, the, cowherd, community, of, the, abh, ras, in, the, 4th, century, ce, the, character, of, gopala, krishna, is, often, considered, to, be, non, vedic, according, to, dandekar, such, mergers, consolidated, the, position, of, krishnaism, between, the, heterodox, sramana, movement, and, the, orthodox, vedic, religion, the, greater, krsnaism, states, dandekar, then, adopted, the, rigvedic, vishnu, as, supreme, deity, to, increase, its, appeal, towards, orthodox, elements, according, to, klostermaier, vaishnavism, originates, in, the, latest, centuries, bce, and, the, early, centuries, ce, with, the, cult, of, the, heroic, v, sudeva, a, leading, member, of, the, vrishni, heroes, which, was, then, amalgamated, with, krishna, hero, of, the, yadavas, and, still, several, centuries, later, with, the, divine, child, bala, krishna, of, the, gopala, traditions, according, to, klostermaier, in, some, books, krishna, is, presented, as, the, founder, and, first, teacher, of, the, bhagavata, religion, according, to, dalal, the, term, bhagavata, seems, to, have, developed, from, the, concept, of, the, vedic, deity, bhaga, and, initially, it, seems, to, have, been, a, monotheistic, sect, independent, of, the, brahmanical, pantheon, the, development, of, the, krishna, traditions, was, followed, by, a, syncretism, of, these, non, vedic, traditions, with, the, mahabharata, canon, thus, affiliating, itself, with, vedism, in, order, to, become, acceptable, to, the, orthodox, establishment, the, vishnu, of, the, rig, veda, was, assimilated, into, non, vedic, krishnaism, and, became, the, equivalent, of, the, supreme, god, the, appearance, of, krishna, as, one, of, the, avatars, of, vishnu, dates, to, the, period, of, the, sanskrit, epics, in, the, early, centuries, ce, the, bhagavad, gita, initially, a, krishnaite, scripture, according, to, friedhelm, hardy, was, incorporated, into, the, mahabharata, as, a, key, text, for, krishnaism, finally, the, narayana, worshippers, were, also, included, which, further, brahmanized, vaishnavism, the, nara, narayana, worshippers, may, have, originated, in, badari, a, northern, ridge, of, the, hindu, kush, and, absorbed, into, the, vedic, orthodoxy, as, purusa, narayana, purusa, narayana, may, have, later, been, turned, into, arjuna, and, krsna, in, the, late, vedic, texts, 1000, to, 500, bce, the, concept, of, a, metaphysical, brahman, grows, in, prominence, and, the, vaishnavism, tradition, considered, vishnu, to, be, identical, to, brahman, just, like, shaivism, and, shaktism, consider, shiva, and, devi, to, be, brahman, respectively, this, complex, history, is, reflected, in, the, two, main, historical, denominations, of, vishnavism, the, bhagavats, worship, v, sudeva, krishna, and, are, followers, of, brahmanic, vaishnavism, while, the, pacaratrins, regard, narayana, as, their, founder, and, are, followers, of, tantric, vaishnavism, s, krishnaswami, aiyangar, states, that, the, lifetime, of, the, vaishnava, alvars, was, during, the, first, half, of, the, 12th, century, their, works, flourishing, about, the, time, of, the, revival, of, brahminism, and, hinduism, in, the, north, speculating, that, vaishnavism, might, have, penetrated, to, the, south, as, early, as, about, the, first, century, ce, there, also, exists, secular, literature, that, ascribes, the, commencement, of, the, tradition, in, the, south, to, the, 3rd, century, ce, u, v, swaminathan, aiyar, a, scholar, of, tamil, literature, published, the, ancient, work, of, the, sangam, period, known, as, the, paripatal, which, contains, seven, poems, in, praise, of, vishnu, including, references, to, krishna, and, balarama, aiyangar, references, an, invasion, of, the, south, by, the, mauryas, in, some, of, the, older, poems, of, the, sangam, and, indicated, that, the, opposition, that, was, set, up, and, maintained, persistently, against, northern, conquest, had, possibly, in, it, an, element, of, religion, the, south, standing, up, for, orthodox, brahmanism, against, the, encroachment, of, buddhism, by, the, persuasive, eloquence, and, persistent, effort, of, the, buddhist, emperor, ashoka, the, tamil, literature, of, this, period, has, references, scattered, all, over, to, the, colonies, of, brahmans, brought, and, settled, down, in, the, south, and, the, whole, output, of, this, archaic, literature, exhibits, unmistakably, considerable, brahman, influence, in, the, making, up, of, that, literature, the, vaishnava, school, of, the, south, based, its, teachings, on, the, naradiya, pancharatra, and, the, bhagavata, from, the, north, and, laid, stress, on, a, life, of, purity, high, morality, worship, and, devotion, to, only, one, god, although, the, monism, of, shankara, was, greatly, appreciated, by, the, intellectual, class, the, masses, came, increasingly, within, the, fold, of, vishnu, vaishnavism, checked, the, elaborate, rituals, ceremonials, vratas, fasts, and, feasts, prescribed, by, the, smritis, and, puranas, for, the, daily, life, of, a, hindu, and, also, the, worship, of, various, deities, like, the, sun, the, moon, the, grahas, or, planets, enjoined, by, the, priestly, brahmin, class, for, the, sake, of, emoluments, and, gain, it, enjoined, the, worship, of, no, other, deities, except, narayana, of, the, upanishads, who, was, deemed, the, primal, cause, of, srsti, creation, sthiti, existence, and, pralaya, destruction, the, accompanying, philosophies, of, advaita, and, vishishtadvaita, brought, the, lower, classes, into, the, fold, of, practical, hinduism, and, extended, to, them, the, right, and, privilege, of, knowing, god, and, attaining, mukti, salvation, the, pallava, dynasty, of, tamilakam, patronised, vaishnavism, mahendra, varman, built, shrines, both, of, vishnu, and, shiva, several, of, his, cave, temples, exhibiting, shrines, to, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, in, the, age, of, the, pallava, domination, which, followed, immediately, both, vaishnavism, and, shaivism, flourished, fighting, the, insurgent, buddhists, and, jains, the, pallavas, were, also, the, first, of, various, dynasties, that, offered, land, and, wealth, to, the, venkatesvara, temple, at, tirumala, which, would, soon, become, the, most, revered, religious, site, of, south, india, the, sri, vaishnava, acharya, ramanuja, is, credited, with, the, conversion, of, the, hoysala, king, vishnuvardhana, originally, called, bittideva, from, jainism, to, vaishnavism, consolidating, the, faith, in, karnataka, the, chalukyas, and, their, rivals, of, the, pallavas, appear, to, have, employed, vaishnavism, as, an, assertion, of, divine, kingship, one, of, them, proclaiming, themselves, as, terrestrial, emanations, of, vishnu, while, the, other, promptly, adopted, shaivism, as, their, favoured, tradition, neither, of, them, offering, much, importance, to, the, other, s, deity, the, sri, vaishnava, sampradaya, of, ramanuja, would, hold, sway, in, the, south, the, vadakalai, denomination, subscribing, to, vedanta, philosophy, and, the, tenkalai, adhering, to, regional, liturgies, known, as, prabandham, according, to, hardy, there, is, evidence, of, early, southern, krishnaism, despite, the, tendency, to, allocate, the, krishna, traditions, to, the, northern, traditions, south, indian, texts, show, close, parallel, with, the, sanskrit, traditions, of, krishna, and, his, gopi, companions, so, ubiquitous, in, later, north, indian, text, and, imagery, early, writings, in, tamils, culture, such, as, manimekalai, and, the, cilappatikaram, present, krishna, his, brother, and, favourite, female, companions, in, the, similar, terms, hardy, argues, that, the, sanskrit, bhagavata, purana, is, essentially, a, sanskrit, translation, of, the, bhakti, of, the, tamil, alvars, devotion, to, the, southern, indian, mal, perumal, may, be, an, early, form, of, krishnaism, since, mal, appears, as, a, divine, figure, largely, like, krishna, with, some, elements, of, vishnu, the, alvars, whose, name, can, be, translated, immersed, were, devotees, of, perumal, they, codified, the, vaishnava, canon, of, the, south, with, their, most, significant, liturgy, the, naalayira, divya, prabandham, traced, to, the, 10th, century, as, a, compilation, by, nathamuni, their, poems, show, a, pronounced, orientation, to, the, vaishnava, and, often, krishna, side, of, mal, but, they, do, not, make, the, distinction, between, krishna, and, vishnu, on, the, basis, of, the, concept, of, the, avatars, yet, according, to, hardy, the, term, mayonism, should, be, used, instead, of, krishnaism, when, referring, to, mal, or, mayon, the, early, alvars, speak, of, glorifying, vishnu, bhakti, devotion, to, vishnu, but, at, the, same, time, they, do, regard, shiva, bhakti, devotion, to, shiva, with, considerable, sympathy, and, make, a, visible, effort, to, keep, the, shaivas, in, countenance, the, earliest, alvars, go, the, length, of, describing, shiva, and, vishnu, as, one, although, they, do, recognise, their, united, form, as, vishnu, srirangam, the, site, of, the, largest, functioning, temple, in, the, world, of, 600, acres, is, devoted, to, ranganathaswamy, a, form, of, vishnu, the, legend, goes, that, king, vibhishana, who, was, carrying, the, idol, of, ranganatha, on, his, way, to, lanka, took, rest, for, a, while, by, placing, the, statue, on, the, ground, when, he, prepared, to, depart, he, realised, that, the, idol, was, stuck, to, the, ground, so, he, built, a, small, shrine, which, became, a, popular, abode, for, the, deity, ranganatha, on, the, banks, of, the, river, kaveri, the, entire, temple, campus, with, great, walls, towards, mandapas, halls, with, 1000, pillars, were, constructed, over, a, period, of, 300, years, from, the, 14th, to, 17th, century, ce, most, of, the, gupta, kings, beginning, with, chandragupta, ii, vikramaditya, 375, 413, ce, were, known, as, parama, bhagavatas, or, bhagavata, vaishnavas, but, following, the, huna, invasions, especially, those, of, the, alchon, huns, circa, 500, ce, the, gupta, empire, declined, and, fragmented, ultimately, collapsing, completely, with, the, effect, of, discrediting, vaishnavism, the, religion, it, had, been, so, ardently, promoting, the, newly, arising, regional, powers, in, central, and, northern, india, such, as, the, aulikaras, the, maukharis, the, maitrakas, the, kalacuris, or, the, vardhanas, preferred, adopting, saivism, instead, giving, a, strong, impetus, to, the, development, of, the, worship, of, shiva, and, its, ideology, of, power, vaisnavism, remained, strong, mainly, in, the, territories, which, had, not, been, affected, by, these, events, south, india, and, kashmir, after, the, gupta, age, krishnaism, rose, to, a, major, current, of, vaishnavism, and, vaishnavism, developed, into, various, sects, and, subsects, most, of, them, emphasizing, bhakti, which, was, strongly, influenced, by, south, indian, religiosity, modern, scholarship, posit, nimbarkacharya, c, 7th, century, ce, to, this, period, who, propounded, radha, krishna, worship, and, his, doctrine, came, to, be, known, as, dvaita, advaita, vaishnavism, in, the, 10th, century, started, to, employ, vedanta, arguments, possibly, continuing, an, older, tradition, of, vishnu, oriented, vedanta, predating, advaita, vedanta, many, of, the, early, vaishnava, scholars, such, as, nathamuni, yamunacharya, and, ramanuja, contested, adi, shankaras, advaita, interpretations, and, proposed, vishnu, bhakti, ideas, instead, vaishnavism, flourished, in, predominantly, shaivite, tamil, nadu, during, the, seventh, to, tenth, centuries, ce, with, the, twelve, alvars, saints, who, spread, the, sect, to, the, common, people, with, their, devotional, hymns, the, temples, that, the, alvars, visited, or, founded, are, now, known, as, divya, desams, their, poems, in, praise, of, vishnu, and, krishna, in, tamil, language, are, collectively, known, as, naalayira, divya, prabandha, 4000, divine, verses, the, bhakti, movement, of, late, medieval, hinduism, started, in, the, 7th, century, but, rapidly, expanded, after, the, 12th, century, it, was, supported, by, the, puranic, literature, such, as, the, bhagavata, purana, poetic, works, as, well, as, many, scholarly, bhasyas, and, samhitas, this, period, saw, the, growth, of, vashnavism, sampradayas, denominations, or, communities, under, the, influence, of, scholars, such, as, ramanujacharya, vedanta, desika, madhvacharya, and, vallabhacharya, bhakti, poets, or, teachers, such, as, manavala, mamunigal, namdev, ramananda, sankardev, surdas, tulsidas, eknath, tyagaraja, chaitanya, mahaprabhu, and, many, others, influenced, the, expansion, of, vaishnavism, even, mirabai, took, part, in, this, specific, movement, these, scholars, rejected, shankara, s, doctrines, of, advaita, vedanta, particularly, ramanuja, in, the, 12th, century, and, vedanta, desika, and, madhva, in, the, 13th, century, building, their, theology, on, the, devotional, tradition, of, the, alvars, sri, vaishnavas, in, north, and, eastern, india, vaishnavism, gave, rise, to, various, late, medieval, movements, ramananda, in, the, 14th, century, sankaradeva, in, the, 15th, and, vallabha, and, chaitanya, in, the, 16th, century, historically, it, was, chaitanya, mahaprabhu, who, founded, congregational, chanting, of, holy, names, of, krishna, in, the, early, 16th, century, after, becoming, a, sannyasi, during, the, 20th, century, vaishnavism, spread, from, india, and, is, now, practised, in, many, places, around, the, globe, including, north, america, europe, africa, russia, and, south, america, a, pioneer, of, vaishnavite, mission, to, the, west, was, sannyasi, baba, premananda, bharati, 1858, 1914, the, author, of, the, first, full, length, treatment, of, bengali, vaishnavism, in, english, sree, krishna, the, lord, of, love, he, founded, the, krishna, samaj, society, in, new, york, city, in, 1902, and, a, temple, in, los, angeles, the, global, status, of, vaishnavism, is, largely, due, to, the, growth, of, the, iskcon, movement, founded, by, a, c, bhaktivedanta, swami, prabhupada, in, 1966, vaishnavism, is, centred, on, the, devotion, of, vishnu, and, his, avatars, according, to, schweig, it, is, a, polymorphic, monotheism, i, e, a, theology, that, recognises, many, forms, ananta, rupa, of, the, one, single, unitary, divinity, since, there, are, many, forms, of, one, original, deity, with, vishnu, taking, many, forms, okita, in, contrast, states, that, the, different, denominations, within, vaishnavism, are, best, described, as, theism, pantheism, and, panentheism, the, vaishnava, sampradaya, started, by, madhvacharya, is, a, monotheistic, tradition, wherein, vishnu, krishna, is, omnipotent, omniscient, and, omnibenevolent, in, contrast, sri, vaishnavism, sampradaya, associated, with, ramanuja, has, monotheistic, elements, but, differs, in, several, ways, such, as, goddess, lakshmi, and, god, vishnu, are, considered, as, inseparable, equal, divinities, according, to, some, scholars, sri, vaishnavism, emphasizes, panentheism, and, not, monotheism, with, its, theology, of, transcendence, and, immanence, where, god, interpenetrates, everything, in, the, universe, and, all, of, empirical, reality, is, god, s, body, the, vaishnava, sampradaya, associated, with, vallabhacharya, is, a, form, of, pantheism, in, contrast, to, the, other, vaishnavism, traditions, the, gaudiya, vaishnava, tradition, of, chaitanya, states, schweig, is, closer, to, a, polymorphic, bi, monotheism, because, both, goddess, radha, and, god, krishna, are, simultaneously, supreme, vaishnavism, precepts, include, the, avatar, incarnation, doctrine, wherein, vishnu, incarnates, numerous, times, in, different, forms, to, set, things, right, and, bring, back, the, balance, in, the, universe, these, avatars, include, narayana, vasudeva, rama, and, krishna, each, the, name, of, a, divine, figure, with, attributed, supremacy, which, each, associated, tradition, of, vaishnavism, believes, to, be, distinct, the, term, krishnaism, k, aism, has, been, used, to, describe, a, large, group, of, independent, traditions, sampradayas, within, vaishnavism, regarded, krishna, as, the, supreme, god, while, vishnuism, may, be, used, for, sects, focusing, on, vishnu, in, which, krishna, is, an, avatar, rather, than, a, transcended, supreme, being, vishnuism, believes, in, vishnu, as, the, supreme, being, when, all, other, vaishnavas, recognise, krishna, as, one, of, vishnu, s, avatars, though, only, the, krishnites, identify, the, supreme, being, svayam, bhagavan, brahman, a, source, of, the, trimurti, with, krishna, and, his, forms, radha, krishna, vithoba, and, others, those, manifested, themselves, as, vishnu, this, is, its, difference, from, such, groups, as, ramaism, radhaism, sitaism, etc, as, such, krishnaism, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, early, attempts, to, make, philosophical, hinduism, appealing, to, the, masses, in, common, language, the, term, krishnaism, is, not, often, used, as, many, prefer, a, wider, term, vaishnavism, which, appeared, to, relate, to, vishnu, more, specifically, as, vishnu, ism, in, vishnu, centered, sects, vishnu, or, narayana, is, the, one, supreme, god, the, belief, in, the, supremacy, of, vishnu, is, based, upon, the, many, avatars, incarnations, of, vishnu, listed, in, the, puranic, texts, which, differs, from, other, hindu, deities, such, as, ganesha, surya, or, durga, to, the, devotees, of, the, sri, vaishnava, sampradaya, lord, vishnu, is, the, supreme, being, and, the, foundation, of, all, existence, lakshmi, his, consort, is, described, to, act, as, the, mediatrix, between, vishnu, and, his, devotees, intervening, to, offer, her, grace, and, forgiveness, according, to, vedanta, desika, the, supreme, divine, couple, lakshmi, narayana, pervades, and, transcends, the, entire, universe, which, is, described, to, be, their, body, they, are, described, to, support, all, life, both, material, and, spiritual, in, this, manner, lakshmi, is, conceived, to, be, the, supreme, mother, and, narayana, as, the, supreme, father, of, creation, in, the, krishnaism, group, of, vaishnavism, traditions, such, as, the, nimbarka, sampradaya, the, first, krishnaite, sampradaya, developed, by, nimbarka, c, 7th, century, ce, ekasarana, dharma, gaudiya, vaishnavism, mahanubhava, rudra, sampradaya, pushtimarg, vaishnava, sahajiya, and, warkari, devotees, worship, krishna, as, the, one, supreme, form, of, god, and, source, of, all, avatars, svayam, bhagavan, krishnaism, is, often, also, called, bhagavatism, perhaps, the, earliest, krishnite, movement, was, bhagavatism, with, krishna, vasudeva, about, 2nd, century, bce, after, the, bhagavata, purana, which, asserts, that, krishna, is, bhagavan, himself, and, subordinates, to, itself, all, other, forms, vishnu, narayana, purusha, ishvara, hari, vasudeva, janardana, etc, krishna, is, often, described, as, having, the, appearance, of, a, dark, skinned, person, and, is, depicted, as, a, young, cowherd, boy, playing, a, flute, or, as, a, youthful, prince, giving, philosophical, direction, and, guidance, as, in, the, bhagavad, gita, krishna, is, also, worshiped, across, many, other, traditions, of, hinduism, krishna, and, the, stories, associated, with, him, appear, across, a, broad, spectrum, of, different, hindu, philosophical, and, theological, traditions, where, it, is, believed, that, god, appears, to, his, devoted, worshippers, in, many, different, forms, depending, on, their, particular, desires, these, forms, include, the, different, avataras, of, krishna, described, in, traditional, vaishnava, texts, but, they, are, not, limited, to, these, indeed, it, is, said, that, the, different, expansions, of, the, svayam, bhagavan, are, uncountable, and, they, cannot, be, fully, described, in, the, finite, scriptures, of, any, one, religious, community, many, of, the, hindu, scriptures, sometimes, differ, in, details, reflecting, the, concerns, of, a, particular, tradition, while, some, core, features, of, the, view, on, krishna, are, shared, by, all, radha, krishna, is, the, combination, of, both, the, feminine, as, well, as, the, masculine, aspects, of, god, krishna, is, often, referred, as, svayam, bhagavan, in, gaudiya, vaishnavism, theology, and, radha, is, krishna, s, internal, potency, and, supreme, beloved, with, krishna, radha, is, acknowledged, as, the, supreme, goddess, for, it, is, said, that, she, controls, krishna, with, her, love, it, is, believed, that, krishna, enchants, the, world, but, radha, enchants, even, him, therefore, she, is, the, supreme, goddess, of, all, radha, and, krishna, are, avatars, of, lakshmi, and, vishnu,
