a, hypothesis, pl, hypotheses, is, a, proposed, explanation, for, a, phenomenon, for, a, hypothesis, to, be, a, scientific, hypothesis, the, scientific, method, requires, that, one, can, test, it, scientists, generally, base, scientific, hypotheses, on, previous, observations, that, cannot, satisfactorily, be, explained, with, the, available, scientific, theories, even, though, the, words, hypothesis, and, theory, are, often, used, interchangeably, a, scientific, hypothesis, is, not, the, same, as, a, scientific, theory, a, working, hypothesis, is, a, provisionally, accepted, hypothesis, proposed, for, further, research, in, a, process, beginning, with, an, educated, guess, or, thought, a, different, meaning, of, the, term, hypothesis, is, used, in, formal, logic, to, denote, the, antecedent, of, a, proposition, thus, in, the, proposition, if, p, then, q, p, denotes, the, hypothesis, or, antecedent, q, can, be, called, a, consequent, p, is, the, assumption, in, a, possibly, counterfactual, what, if, question, the, adjective, hypothetical, meaning, having, the, nature, of, a, hypothesis, or, being, assumed, to, exist, as, an, immediate, consequence, of, a, hypothesis, can, refer, to, any, of, these, meanings, of, the, term, hypothesis, in, its, ancient, usage, hypothesis, referred, to, a, summary, of, the, plot, of, a, classical, drama, the, english, word, hypothesis, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, hypothesis, whose, literal, or, etymological, sense, is, putting, or, placing, under, and, hence, in, extended, use, has, many, other, meanings, including, supposition, in, plato, s, meno, 86e, 87b, socrates, dissects, virtue, with, a, method, used, by, mathematicians, that, of, investigating, from, a, hypothesis, in, this, sense, hypothesis, refers, to, a, clever, idea, or, to, a, convenient, mathematical, approach, that, simplifies, cumbersome, calculations, cardinal, bellarmine, gave, a, famous, example, of, this, usage, in, the, warning, issued, to, galileo, in, the, early, 17th, century, that, he, must, not, treat, the, motion, of, the, earth, as, a, reality, but, merely, as, a, hypothesis, in, common, usage, in, the, 21st, century, a, hypothesis, refers, to, a, provisional, idea, whose, merit, requires, evaluation, for, proper, evaluation, the, framer, of, a, hypothesis, needs, to, define, specifics, in, operational, terms, a, hypothesis, requires, more, work, by, the, researcher, in, order, to, either, confirm, or, disprove, it, in, due, course, a, confirmed, hypothesis, may, become, part, of, a, theory, or, occasionally, may, grow, to, become, a, theory, itself, normally, scientific, hypotheses, have, the, form, of, a, mathematical, model, sometimes, but, not, always, one, can, also, formulate, them, as, existential, statements, stating, that, some, particular, instance, of, the, phenomenon, under, examination, has, some, characteristic, and, causal, explanations, which, have, the, general, form, of, universal, statements, stating, that, every, instance, of, the, phenomenon, has, a, particular, characteristic, in, entrepreneurial, setting, a, hypothesis, is, used, to, formulate, provisional, ideas, about, the, attributes, of, products, or, business, models, the, formulated, hypothesis, is, then, evaluated, where, the, hypothesis, is, proven, to, be, either, true, or, false, through, a, verifiability, or, falsifiability, oriented, experiment, any, useful, hypothesis, will, enable, predictions, by, reasoning, including, deductive, reasoning, it, might, predict, the, outcome, of, an, experiment, in, a, laboratory, setting, or, the, observation, of, a, phenomenon, in, nature, the, prediction, may, also, invoke, statistics, and, only, talk, about, probabilities, karl, popper, following, others, has, argued, that, a, hypothesis, must, be, falsifiable, and, that, one, cannot, regard, a, proposition, or, theory, as, scientific, if, it, does, not, admit, the, possibility, of, being, shown, to, be, false, other, philosophers, of, science, have, rejected, the, criterion, of, falsifiability, or, supplemented, it, with, other, criteria, such, as, verifiability, e, g, verificationism, or, coherence, e, g, confirmation, holism, the, scientific, method, involves, experimentation, to, test, the, ability, of, some, hypothesis, to, adequately, answer, the, question, under, investigation, in, contrast, unfettered, observation, is, not, as, likely, to, raise, unexplained, issues, or, open, questions, in, science, as, would, the, formulation, of, a, crucial, experiment, to, test, the, hypothesis, a, thought, experiment, might, also, be, used, to, test, the, hypothesis, in, framing, a, hypothesis, the, investigator, must, not, currently, know, the, outcome, of, a, test, or, that, it, remains, reasonably, under, continuing, investigation, only, in, such, cases, does, the, experiment, test, or, study, potentially, increase, the, probability, of, showing, the, truth, of, a, hypothesis, pp17, 49, 50, if, the, researcher, already, knows, the, outcome, it, counts, as, a, consequence, and, the, researcher, should, have, already, considered, this, while, formulating, the, hypothesis, if, one, cannot, assess, the, predictions, by, observation, or, by, experience, the, hypothesis, needs, to, be, tested, by, others, providing, observations, for, example, a, new, technology, or, theory, might, make, the, necessary, experiments, feasible, a, trial, solution, to, a, problem, is, commonly, referred, to, as, a, hypothesis, or, often, as, an, educated, guess, because, it, provides, a, suggested, outcome, based, on, the, evidence, however, some, scientists, reject, the, term, educated, guess, as, incorrect, experimenters, may, test, and, reject, several, hypotheses, before, solving, the, problem, according, to, schick, and, vaughn, researchers, weighing, up, alternative, hypotheses, may, take, into, consideration, a, working, hypothesis, is, a, hypothesis, that, is, provisionally, accepted, as, a, basis, for, further, research, in, the, hope, that, a, tenable, theory, will, be, produced, even, if, the, hypothesis, ultimately, fails, like, all, hypotheses, a, working, hypothesis, is, constructed, as, a, statement, of, expectations, which, can, be, linked, to, the, exploratory, research, purpose, in, empirical, investigation, working, hypotheses, are, often, used, as, a, conceptual, framework, in, qualitative, research, the, provisional, nature, of, working, hypotheses, makes, them, useful, as, an, organizing, device, in, applied, research, here, they, act, like, a, useful, guide, to, address, problems, that, are, still, in, a, formative, phase, in, recent, years, philosophers, of, science, have, tried, to, integrate, the, various, approaches, to, evaluating, hypotheses, and, the, scientific, method, in, general, to, form, a, more, complete, system, that, integrates, the, individual, concerns, of, each, approach, notably, imre, lakatos, and, paul, feyerabend, karl, popper, s, colleague, and, student, respectively, have, produced, novel, attempts, at, such, a, synthesis, concepts, in, hempel, s, deductive, nomological, model, play, a, key, role, in, the, development, and, testing, of, hypotheses, most, formal, hypotheses, connect, concepts, by, specifying, the, expected, relationships, between, propositions, when, a, set, of, hypotheses, are, grouped, together, they, become, a, type, of, conceptual, framework, when, a, conceptual, framework, is, complex, and, incorporates, causality, or, explanation, it, is, generally, referred, to, as, a, theory, according, to, noted, philosopher, of, science, carl, gustav, hempel, hempel, provides, a, useful, metaphor, that, describes, the, relationship, between, a, conceptual, framework, and, the, framework, as, it, is, observed, and, perhaps, tested, interpreted, framework, the, whole, system, floats, as, it, were, above, the, plane, of, observation, and, is, anchored, to, it, by, rules, of, interpretation, these, might, be, viewed, as, strings, which, are, not, part, of, the, network, but, link, certain, points, of, the, latter, with, specific, places, in, the, plane, of, observation, by, virtue, of, those, interpretative, connections, the, network, can, function, as, a, scientific, theory, 36, hypotheses, with, concepts, anchored, in, the, plane, of, observation, are, ready, to, be, tested, in, actual, scientific, practice, the, process, of, framing, a, theoretical, structure, and, of, interpreting, it, are, not, always, sharply, separated, since, the, intended, interpretation, usually, guides, the, construction, of, the, theoretician, 33, it, is, however, possible, and, indeed, desirable, for, the, purposes, of, logical, clarification, to, separate, the, two, steps, conceptually, 33, when, a, possible, correlation, or, similar, relation, between, phenomena, is, investigated, such, as, whether, a, proposed, remedy, is, effective, in, treating, a, disease, the, hypothesis, that, a, relation, exists, cannot, be, examined, the, same, way, one, might, examine, a, proposed, new, law, of, nature, in, such, an, investigation, if, the, tested, remedy, shows, no, effect, in, a, few, cases, these, do, not, necessarily, falsify, the, hypothesis, instead, statistical, tests, are, used, to, determine, how, likely, it, is, that, the, overall, effect, would, be, observed, if, the, hypothesized, relation, does, not, exist, if, that, likelihood, is, sufficiently, small, e, g, less, than, 1, the, existence, of, a, relation, may, be, assumed, otherwise, any, observed, effect, may, be, due, to, pure, chance, in, statistical, hypothesis, testing, two, hypotheses, are, compared, these, are, called, the, null, hypothesis, and, the, alternative, hypothesis, the, null, hypothesis, is, the, hypothesis, that, states, that, there, is, no, relation, between, the, phenomena, whose, relation, is, under, investigation, or, at, least, not, of, the, form, given, by, the, alternative, hypothesis, the, alternative, hypothesis, as, the, name, suggests, is, the, alternative, to, the, null, hypothesis, it, states, that, there, is, some, kind, of, relation, the, alternative, hypothesis, may, take, several, forms, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, hypothesized, relation, in, particular, it, can, be, two, sided, for, example, there, is, some, effect, in, a, yet, unknown, direction, or, one, sided, the, direction, of, the, hypothesized, relation, positive, or, negative, is, fixed, in, advance, conventional, significance, levels, for, testing, hypotheses, acceptable, probabilities, of, wrongly, rejecting, a, true, null, hypothesis, are, 10, 05, and, 01, the, significance, level, for, deciding, whether, the, null, hypothesis, is, rejected, and, the, alternative, hypothesis, is, accepted, must, be, determined, in, advance, before, the, observations, are, collected, or, inspected, if, these, criteria, are, determined, later, when, the, data, to, be, tested, are, already, known, the, test, is, invalid, the, above, procedure, is, actually, dependent, on, the, number, of, the, participants, units, or, sample, size, that, are, included, in, the, study, for, instance, to, avoid, having, the, sample, size, be, too, small, to, reject, a, null, hypothesis, it, is, recommended, that, one, specify, a, sufficient, sample, size, from, the, beginning, it, is, advisable, to, define, a, small, medium, and, large, effect, size, for, each, of, a, number, of, important, statistical, tests, which, are, used, to, test, the, hypotheses, mount, hypothesis, in, antarctica, is, named, in, appreciation, of, the, role, of, hypothesis, in, scientific, research, several, hypotheses, have, been, put, forth, in, different, subject, areas, hypothesis, working, hypothesis, a, hypothesis, suggested, or, supported, in, some, measure, by, features, of, observed, facts, from, which, consequences, may, be, deduced, which, can, be, tested, by, experiment, and, special, observations, and, which, it, is, proposed, to, subject, to, an, extended, course, of, such, investigation, with, the, hope, that, even, should, the, hypothesis, thus, be, overthrown, such, research, may, lead, to, a, tenable, theory
