in, moral, philosophy, deontological, ethics, or, deontology, from, greek, obligation, duty, study, is, the, normative, ethical, theory, that, the, morality, of, an, action, should, be, based, on, whether, that, action, itself, is, right, or, wrong, under, a, series, of, rules, and, principles, rather, than, based, on, the, consequences, of, the, action, it, is, sometimes, described, as, duty, obligation, or, rule, based, ethics, deontological, ethics, is, commonly, contrasted, to, consequentialism, utilitarianism, virtue, ethics, and, pragmatic, ethics, in, this, terminology, action, is, more, important, than, the, consequences, the, term, deontological, was, first, used, to, describe, the, current, specialised, definition, by, c, d, broad, in, his, 1930, book, five, types, of, ethical, theory, older, usage, of, the, term, goes, back, to, jeremy, bentham, who, coined, it, prior, to, 1816, as, a, synonym, of, dicastic, or, censorial, ethics, i, e, ethics, based, on, judgement, the, more, general, sense, of, the, word, is, retained, in, french, especially, in, the, term, code, de, d, ontologie, ethical, code, in, the, context, of, professional, ethics, depending, on, the, system, of, deontological, ethics, under, consideration, a, moral, obligation, may, arise, from, an, external, or, internal, source, such, as, a, set, of, rules, inherent, to, the, universe, ethical, naturalism, religious, law, or, a, set, of, personal, or, cultural, values, any, of, which, may, be, in, conflict, with, personal, desires, there, are, numerous, formulations, of, deontological, ethics, immanuel, kant, s, theory, of, ethics, is, considered, deontological, for, several, different, reasons, first, kant, argues, that, in, order, to, act, in, the, morally, right, way, people, must, act, from, duty, pflicht, second, kant, argued, that, it, was, not, the, consequences, of, actions, that, make, them, right, or, wrong, but, the, motives, of, the, person, who, carries, out, the, action, kant, s, first, argument, begins, with, the, premise, that, the, highest, good, must, be, both, good, in, itself, and, good, without, qualification, something, is, good, in, itself, when, it, is, intrinsically, good, and, is, good, without, qualification, when, the, addition, of, that, thing, never, makes, a, situation, ethically, worse, kant, then, argues, that, those, things, that, are, usually, thought, to, be, good, such, as, intelligence, perseverance, and, pleasure, fail, to, be, either, intrinsically, good, or, good, without, qualification, pleasure, for, example, appears, not, to, be, good, without, qualification, because, when, people, take, pleasure, in, watching, someone, suffer, this, seems, to, make, the, situation, ethically, worse, he, concludes, that, there, is, only, one, thing, that, is, truly, good, nothing, in, the, world, indeed, nothing, even, beyond, the, world, can, possibly, be, conceived, which, could, be, called, good, without, qualification, except, a, good, will, kant, then, argues, that, the, consequences, of, an, act, of, willing, cannot, be, used, to, determine, that, the, person, has, a, good, will, good, consequences, could, arise, by, accident, from, an, action, that, was, motivated, by, a, desire, to, cause, harm, to, an, innocent, person, and, bad, consequences, could, arise, from, an, action, that, was, well, motivated, instead, he, claims, a, person, has, a, good, will, when, they, act, out, of, respect, for, the, moral, law, people, act, out, of, respect, for, the, moral, law, when, they, act, in, some, way, because, they, have, a, duty, to, do, so, thus, the, only, thing, that, is, truly, good, in, itself, is, a, good, will, and, a, good, will, is, only, good, when, the, willer, chooses, to, do, something, because, it, is, that, person, s, duty, i, e, out, of, respect, for, the, law, he, defines, respect, as, the, concept, of, a, worth, which, thwarts, my, self, love, kant, s, three, significant, formulations, of, the, categorical, imperative, a, way, of, evaluating, motivations, for, action, are, kant, argued, that, the, only, absolutely, good, thing, is, a, good, will, and, so, the, single, determining, factor, of, whether, an, action, is, morally, right, is, the, will, or, motive, of, the, person, doing, it, if, they, are, acting, on, a, bad, maxim, e, g, i, will, lie, then, their, action, is, wrong, even, if, some, good, consequences, come, of, it, in, his, essay, on, a, supposed, right, to, lie, because, of, philanthropic, concerns, arguing, against, the, position, of, benjamin, constant, des, r, actions, politiques, kant, states, that, hence, a, lie, defined, merely, as, an, intentionally, untruthful, declaration, to, another, man, does, not, require, the, additional, condition, that, it, must, do, harm, to, another, as, jurists, require, in, their, definition, mendacium, est, falsiloquium, in, praeiudicium, alterius, for, a, lie, always, harms, another, if, not, some, human, being, then, it, nevertheless, does, harm, to, humanity, in, general, inasmuch, as, it, vitiates, the, very, source, of, right, all, practical, principles, of, right, must, contain, rigorous, truth, this, is, because, such, exceptions, would, destroy, the, universality, on, account, of, which, alone, they, bear, the, name, of, principles, although, not, all, deontologists, are, religious, some, believe, in, the, divine, command, theory, which, is, actually, a, cluster, of, related, theories, that, essentially, state, that, an, action, is, right, if, god, has, decreed, that, it, is, right, according, to, english, philosopher, ralph, cudworth, william, of, ockham, ren, descartes, and, 18th, century, calvinists, all, accepted, various, versions, of, this, moral, theory, as, they, all, held, that, moral, obligations, arise, from, god, s, commands, the, divine, command, theory, is, a, form, of, deontology, because, according, to, it, the, rightness, of, any, action, depends, upon, that, action, being, performed, because, it, is, a, duty, not, because, of, any, good, consequences, arising, from, that, action, if, god, commands, people, not, to, work, on, sabbath, then, people, act, rightly, if, they, do, not, work, on, sabbath, because, god, has, commanded, that, they, do, not, do, so, if, they, do, not, work, on, sabbath, because, they, are, lazy, then, their, action, is, not, truly, speaking, right, even, though, the, actual, physical, action, performed, is, the, same, if, god, commands, not, to, covet, a, neighbour, s, goods, this, theory, holds, that, it, would, be, immoral, to, do, so, even, if, coveting, provides, the, beneficial, outcome, of, a, drive, to, succeed, or, do, well, one, thing, that, clearly, distinguishes, kantian, deontologism, from, divine, command, deontology, is, that, kantianism, maintains, that, man, as, a, rational, being, makes, the, moral, law, universal, whereas, divine, command, maintains, that, god, makes, the, moral, law, universal, w, d, ross, objects, to, kant, s, monistic, deontology, which, bases, ethics, in, only, one, foundational, principle, the, categorical, imperative, he, contends, that, there, is, a, plurality, 7, although, this, number, is, seen, to, vary, to, interpretation, of, prima, facie, duties, determining, what, is, right, xii, these, duties, are, identified, by, w, d, ross, one, problem, the, deontological, pluralist, has, to, face, is, that, cases, can, arise, where, the, demands, of, one, duty, violate, another, duty, so, called, moral, dilemmas, for, example, there, are, cases, where, it, is, necessary, to, break, a, promise, in, order, to, relieve, someone, s, distress, 28, ross, makes, use, of, the, distinction, between, prima, facie, duties, and, absolute, duty, to, solve, this, problem, 28, the, duties, listed, above, are, prima, facie, duties, moral, actions, that, are, required, unless, a, greater, obligation, trumps, them, they, are, general, principles, whose, validity, is, self, evident, to, morally, mature, persons, they, are, factors, that, do, not, take, all, considerations, into, account, absolute, duty, on, the, other, hand, is, particular, to, one, specific, situation, taking, everything, into, account, and, has, to, be, judged, on, a, case, by, case, basis, it, is, absolute, duty, that, determines, which, acts, are, right, or, wrong, contemporary, deontologists, i, e, scholars, born, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, include, j, zef, maria, boche, ski, thomas, nagel, t, m, scanlon, and, roger, scruton, boche, ski, 1965, makes, a, distinction, between, deontic, and, epistemic, authority, scruton, 2017, in, his, book, on, human, nature, is, critical, of, consequentialism, and, similar, ethical, theories, such, as, hedonism, and, utilitarianism, instead, proposing, a, deontological, ethical, approach, he, implies, that, proportional, duty, and, obligation, are, essential, components, of, the, ways, in, which, we, decide, to, act, and, he, defends, natural, law, against, opposing, theories, he, also, expresses, admiration, for, virtue, ethics, and, believes, that, the, two, ethical, theories, are, not, as, is, frequently, portrayed, mutually, exclusive, frances, kamm, s, principle, of, permissible, harm, 1996, is, an, effort, to, derive, a, deontological, constraint, that, coheres, with, our, considered, case, judgments, while, also, relying, heavily, on, kant, s, categorical, imperative, the, principle, states, that, one, may, harm, in, order, to, save, more, if, and, only, if, the, harm, is, an, effect, or, an, aspect, of, the, greater, good, itself, this, principle, is, meant, to, address, what, kamm, feels, are, most, people, s, considered, case, judgments, many, of, which, involve, deontological, intuitions, for, instance, kamm, argues, that, we, believe, it, would, be, impermissible, to, kill, one, person, to, harvest, his, organs, in, order, to, save, the, lives, of, five, others, yet, we, think, it, is, morally, permissible, to, divert, a, runaway, trolley, that, would, otherwise, kill, five, innocent, immobile, people, onto, a, sidetrack, where, only, one, innocent, and, immobile, person, will, be, killed, kamm, believes, the, principle, of, permissible, harm, explains, the, moral, difference, between, these, and, other, cases, and, more, importantly, expresses, a, constraint, telling, us, exactly, when, we, may, not, act, to, bring, about, good, ends, such, as, in, the, organ, harvesting, case, in, 2007, kamm, published, intricate, ethics, a, book, that, presents, a, new, theory, the, doctrine, of, productive, purity, that, incorporates, aspects, of, her, principle, of, permissible, harm, like, the, principle, the, doctrine, of, productive, purity, is, an, attempt, to, provide, a, deontological, prescription, for, determining, the, circumstances, in, which, people, are, permitted, to, act, in, a, way, that, harms, others, various, attempts, have, been, made, to, reconcile, deontology, with, consequentialism, threshold, deontology, holds, that, rules, ought, to, govern, up, to, a, point, despite, adverse, consequences, but, when, the, consequences, become, so, dire, that, they, cross, a, stipulated, threshold, consequentialism, takes, over, theories, put, forth, by, thomas, nagel, and, michael, s, moore, attempt, to, reconcile, deontology, with, consequentialism, by, assigning, each, a, jurisdiction, iain, king, s, 2008, book, how, to, make, good, decisions, and, be, right, all, the, time, uses, quasi, realism, and, a, modified, form, of, utilitarianism, to, develop, deontological, principles, that, are, compatible, with, ethics, based, on, virtues, and, consequences, king, develops, a, hierarchy, of, principles, to, link, his, meta, ethics, which, is, more, inclined, towards, consequentialism, with, the, deontological, conclusions, he, presents, in, his, book, intuition, based, deontology, is, a, concept, within, secular, ethics, a, classical, example, of, literature, on, secular, ethics, is, the, kural, text, authored, by, the, ancient, tamil, indian, philosopher, valluvar, it, can, be, argued, that, some, concepts, from, deontological, ethics, date, back, to, this, text, concerning, ethical, intuitionism, 20th, century, philosopher, c, d, broad, coined, the, term, deontological, ethics, to, refer, to, the, normative, doctrines, associated, with, intuitionism, leaving, the, phrase, ethical, intuitionism, free, to, refer, to, the, epistemological, doctrines
