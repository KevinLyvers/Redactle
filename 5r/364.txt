egyptian, goddess, sekhmet, and, that, therefore, that, her, character, might, have, been, influenced, by, them, the, bronze, age, epic, cycles, of, the, levantine, city, of, ugarit, include, a, myth, according, to, which, the, warrior, goddess, anat, started, attacking, warriors, with, the, text, of, the, myth, describing, the, goddess, as, gloating, and, her, heart, filling, with, joy, and, her,

egyptian, myth, called, the, deliverance, of, mankind, from, destruction, the, ancient, egyptian, supreme, god, the, sun, god, ra, suspected, that, mankind, was, plotting, against, him, and, so, he, sent, the, goddess, hathor, who, was, the, incarnation, of, his, violent, feminine, aspect, the, eye, of, ra, to, destroy, his, enemies, furthermore, hathor, appeared, as, the, lion, goddess, sekhmet, and, carried, out, ra, s, orders, until, she, became, so, captured, by, her, blood, lust, that, she, would, not, stop, despite, ra, himself, becoming, distressed, and, wishing, an, end, to, the, killing, therefore, ra, concocted, a, ruse, whereby, a, plain, was, flooded, with, beer, which, had, been, dyed, red, which, sekhmet, mistook, for, blood, and, drank, until, she, became, too, inebriated, to, continue, killing, thus, saving, humanity, from, destruction, similarly, while, killing, demons, k, l, became, ecstatic, with, the, joy, of, battle, and, slaughter, and, refused, to,
