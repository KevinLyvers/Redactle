a, devil, is, the, personification, of, evil, as, it, is, conceived, in, various, cultures, and, religious, traditions, it, is, seen, as, the, objectification, of, a, hostile, and, destructive, force, jeffrey, burton, russell, states, that, the, different, conceptions, of, the, devil, can, be, summed, up, as, 1, a, principle, of, evil, independent, from, god, 2, an, aspect, of, god, 3, a, created, being, turning, evil, a, fallen, angel, and, 4, a, symbol, of, human, evil, 23, each, tradition, culture, and, religion, with, a, devil, in, its, mythos, offers, a, different, lens, on, manifestations, of, evil, the, history, of, these, perspectives, intertwines, with, theology, mythology, psychiatry, art, and, literature, developing, independently, within, each, of, the, traditions, it, occurs, historically, in, many, contexts, and, cultures, and, is, given, many, different, names, satan, lucifer, beelzebub, mephistopheles, iblis, and, attributes, it, is, portrayed, as, blue, black, or, red, it, is, portrayed, as, having, horns, on, its, head, and, without, horns, and, so, on, while, depictions, of, the, devil, are, usually, taken, seriously, there, are, times, when, it, is, treated, less, seriously, when, for, example, devil, figures, are, used, in, advertising, and, on, candy, wrappers, the, modern, english, word, devil, derives, from, the, middle, english, devel, from, the, old, english, d, ofol, that, in, turn, represents, an, early, germanic, borrowing, of, the, latin, diabolus, this, in, turn, was, borrowed, from, the, greek, di, bolos, slanderer, from, diab, llein, to, slander, from, di, across, through, and, b, llein, to, hurl, probably, akin, to, the, sanskrit, gurate, he, lifts, up, in, his, book, the, devil, perceptions, of, evil, from, antiquity, to, primitive, christianity, jeffrey, burton, russell, discusses, various, meanings, and, difficulties, that, are, encountered, when, using, the, term, devil, he, does, not, claim, to, define, the, word, in, a, general, sense, but, he, describes, the, limited, use, that, he, intends, for, the, word, in, his, book, limited, in, order, to, minimize, this, difficulty, and, for, the, sake, of, clarity, in, this, book, russell, uses, the, word, devil, as, the, personification, of, evil, found, in, a, variety, of, cultures, as, opposed, to, the, word, satan, which, he, reserves, specifically, for, the, figure, in, the, abrahamic, religions, in, the, introduction, to, his, book, satan, a, biography, henry, ansgar, kelly, discusses, various, considerations, and, meanings, that, he, has, encountered, in, using, terms, such, as, devil, and, satan, etc, while, not, offering, a, general, definition, he, describes, that, in, his, book, whenever, diabolos, is, used, as, the, proper, name, of, satan, he, signals, it, by, using, small, caps, the, oxford, english, dictionary, has, a, variety, of, definitions, for, the, meaning, of, devil, supported, by, a, range, of, citations, devil, may, refer, to, satan, the, supreme, spirit, of, evil, or, one, of, satan, s, emissaries, or, demons, that, populate, hell, or, to, one, of, the, spirits, that, possess, a, demoniac, person, devil, may, refer, to, one, of, the, malignant, deities, feared, and, worshiped, by, heathen, people, a, demon, a, malignant, being, of, superhuman, powers, figuratively, devil, may, be, applied, to, a, wicked, person, or, playfully, to, a, rogue, or, rascal, or, in, empathy, often, accompanied, by, the, word, poor, to, a, person, poor, devil, in, the, bah, faith, a, malevolent, superhuman, entity, such, as, a, devil, or, satan, is, not, believed, to, exist, however, these, terms, do, appear, in, the, bah, writings, where, they, are, used, as, metaphors, for, the, lower, nature, of, man, human, beings, are, seen, to, have, free, will, and, are, thus, able, to, turn, towards, god, and, develop, spiritual, qualities, or, turn, away, from, god, and, become, immersed, in, their, self, centered, desires, individuals, who, follow, the, temptations, of, the, self, and, do, not, develop, spiritual, virtues, are, often, described, in, the, bah, writings, with, the, word, satanic, the, bah, writings, also, state, that, the, devil, is, a, metaphor, for, the, insistent, self, or, lower, self, which, is, a, self, serving, inclination, within, each, individual, those, who, follow, their, lower, nature, are, also, described, as, followers, of, the, evil, one, in, christianity, the, devil, or, satan, is, a, fallen, angel, who, is, the, primary, opponent, of, god, some, christians, also, considered, the, roman, and, greek, deities, to, be, devils, christianity, describes, satan, as, a, fallen, angel, who, terrorizes, the, world, through, evil, is, opposed, to, truth, and, shall, be, condemned, together, with, the, fallen, angels, who, follow, him, to, eternal, fire, at, the, last, judgment, in, mainstream, christianity, the, devil, is, usually, referred, to, as, satan, this, is, because, christian, beliefs, in, satan, are, inspired, directly, by, the, dominant, view, of, second, temple, judaism, recorded, in, the, enochian, books, as, expressed, practiced, by, jesus, and, with, some, minor, variations, some, modern, christians, consider, the, devil, to, be, an, angel, who, along, with, one, third, of, the, angelic, host, the, demons, rebelled, against, god, and, has, consequently, been, condemned, to, the, lake, of, fire, he, is, described, as, hating, all, humanity, or, more, accurately, all, creation, opposing, god, spreading, lies, and, wreaking, havoc, on, their, souls, in, the, bible, the, devil, is, identified, as, the, dragon, and, the, old, serpent, in, the, book, of, revelation, as, the, prince, of, this, world, in, the, gospel, of, john, the, spirit, that, now, worketh, in, the, children, of, disobedience, in, the, epistle, to, the, ephesians, and, the, god, of, this, world, in, 2, corinthians, 4, 4, he, is, also, identified, as, the, tempter, of, the, gospels, satan, is, traditionally, identified, as, the, serpent, who, convinced, eve, to, eat, the, forbidden, fruit, thus, satan, has, often, been, depicted, as, a, serpent, beelzebub, is, originally, the, name, of, a, philistine, god, more, specifically, a, certain, type, of, baal, from, ba, al, zeb, b, lit, lord, of, flies, but, is, also, used, in, the, new, testament, as, a, synonym, for, the, devil, a, corrupted, version, belzeboub, appears, in, the, divine, comedy, inferno, xxxiv, in, other, non, mainstream, christian, beliefs, e, g, the, beliefs, of, the, christadelphians, the, word, satan, in, the, bible, is, not, regarded, as, referring, to, a, supernatural, personal, being, but, to, any, adversary, and, figuratively, refers, to, human, sin, and, temptation, in, the, book, of, wisdom, the, devil, is, represented, as, the, one, who, brought, death, into, the, world, the, second, book, of, enoch, contains, references, to, a, watcher, called, satanael, describing, him, as, the, prince, of, the, grigori, who, was, cast, out, of, heaven, and, an, evil, spirit, who, knew, the, difference, between, what, was, righteous, and, sinful, in, the, book, of, jubilees, satan, rules, over, a, host, of, angels, mastema, who, induced, god, to, test, abraham, through, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, is, identical, with, satan, in, both, name, and, nature, the, book, of, enoch, contains, references, to, sathariel, thought, also, to, be, sataniel, and, satan, el, the, similar, spellings, mirror, that, of, his, angelic, brethren, michael, raphael, uriel, and, gabriel, previous, to, his, expulsion, from, heaven, gnostic, and, gnostic, influenced, religions, postulate, the, idea, that, the, material, world, is, inherently, evil, the, one, true, god, is, remote, beyond, the, material, universe, therefore, this, universe, must, be, governed, by, an, inferior, imposter, deity, this, deity, was, identified, with, the, deity, of, the, old, testament, by, some, sects, such, as, the, sethians, and, the, marcions, tertullian, accuses, marcion, of, sinope, that, he, the, old, testament, was, a, scandal, to, the, faithful, and, accounted, for, it, by, postulating, a, secondary, deity, a, demiurgus, who, was, god, in, a, sense, but, not, the, supreme, god, he, was, just, rigidly, just, he, had, his, good, qualities, but, he, was, not, the, good, god, who, was, father, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, john, arendzen, 1909, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, 1913, mentions, that, eusebius, accused, apelles, the, 2nd, century, ad, gnostic, of, considering, the, inspirer, of, old, testament, prophecies, to, be, not, a, god, but, an, evil, angel, these, writings, commonly, refer, to, the, creator, of, the, material, world, as, a, demiurgus, to, distinguish, him, from, the, one, true, god, some, texts, such, as, the, apocryphon, of, john, and, on, the, origin, of, the, world, not, only, demonized, the, creator, god, but, also, called, him, by, the, name, of, the, devil, in, some, jewish, writings, samael, in, the, 12th, century, in, europe, the, cathars, who, were, rooted, in, gnosticism, dealt, with, the, problem, of, evil, and, developed, ideas, of, dualism, and, demonology, the, cathars, were, seen, as, a, serious, potential, challenge, to, the, catholic, church, of, the, time, the, cathars, split, into, two, camps, the, first, is, absolute, dualism, which, held, that, evil, was, completely, separate, from, the, good, god, and, that, god, and, the, devil, each, had, power, the, second, camp, is, mitigated, dualism, which, considers, lucifer, to, be, a, son, of, god, and, a, brother, to, christ, to, explain, this, they, used, the, parable, of, the, prodigal, son, with, christ, as, the, good, son, and, lucifer, as, the, son, that, strayed, into, evilness, the, catholic, church, responded, to, dualism, in, ad, 1215, in, the, fourth, lateran, council, saying, that, god, created, everything, from, nothing, and, the, devil, was, good, when, he, was, created, but, he, made, himself, bad, by, his, own, free, will, in, the, gospel, of, the, secret, supper, lucifer, just, as, in, prior, gnostic, systems, appears, as, a, demiurge, who, created, the, material, world, in, islam, the, principle, of, evil, is, expressed, by, two, terms, referring, to, the, same, entity, shaitan, meaning, astray, distant, or, devil, and, iblis, iblis, is, the, proper, name, of, the, devil, representing, the, characteristics, of, evil, iblis, is, mentioned, in, the, quranic, narrative, about, the, creation, of, humanity, when, god, created, adam, he, ordered, the, angels, to, prostrate, themselves, before, him, out, of, pride, iblis, refused, and, claimed, to, be, superior, to, adam, therefore, pride, but, also, envy, became, a, sign, of, unbelief, in, islam, thereafter, iblis, was, condemned, to, hell, but, god, granted, him, a, request, to, lead, humanity, astray, knowing, the, righteous, would, resist, iblis, attempts, to, misguide, them, in, islam, both, good, and, evil, are, ultimately, created, by, god, but, since, god, s, will, is, good, the, evil, in, the, world, must, be, part, of, god, s, plan, actually, god, allowed, the, devil, to, seduce, humanity, evil, and, suffering, are, regarded, as, a, test, or, a, chance, to, prove, confidence, in, god, some, philosophers, and, mystics, emphasized, iblis, himself, as, a, role, model, of, confidence, in, god, because, god, ordered, the, angels, to, prostrate, themselves, iblis, was, forced, to, choose, between, god, s, command, and, god, s, will, not, to, praise, someone, other, than, god, he, successfully, passed, the, test, yet, his, disobedience, caused, his, punishment, and, therefore, suffering, however, he, stays, patient, and, is, rewarded, in, the, end, muslims, hold, that, the, pre, islamic, jinn, tutelary, deities, became, subject, under, islam, to, the, judgment, of, god, and, that, those, who, did, not, submit, to, the, law, of, god, are, devils, although, iblis, is, often, compared, to, the, devil, in, christian, theology, islam, rejects, the, idea, that, satan, is, an, opponent, of, god, and, the, implied, struggle, between, god, and, the, devil, iblis, might, either, be, regarded, as, the, most, monotheistic, or, the, greatest, sinner, but, remains, only, a, creature, of, god, iblis, did, not, become, an, unbeliever, due, to, his, disobedience, but, because, of, attributing, injustice, to, god, that, is, by, asserting, that, the, command, to, prostrate, himself, before, adam, was, inappropriate, there, is, no, reference, to, angelic, revolt, in, the, quran, and, no, mention, of, iblis, trying, to, take, god, s, throne, and, iblis, s, sin, could, be, forgiven, at, any, time, by, god, according, to, the, quran, iblis, s, disobedience, was, due, to, his, disdain, for, humanity, a, narrative, already, occurring, in, early, new, testament, apocrypha, as, in, christianity, iblis, was, once, a, pious, creature, of, god, but, later, cast, out, of, heaven, due, to, his, pride, however, to, maintain, god, s, absolute, sovereignty, islam, matches, the, line, taken, by, irenaeus, instead, of, the, later, christian, consensus, that, the, devil, did, not, rebel, against, god, but, against, humanity, further, although, iblis, is, generally, regarded, as, a, real, bodily, entity, he, plays, a, less, significant, role, as, the, personification, of, evil, than, in, christianity, iblis, is, merely, a, tempter, notable, for, inciting, humans, into, sin, by, whispering, into, humans, minds, wasw, s, akin, to, the, jewish, idea, of, the, devil, as, yetzer, hara, on, the, other, hand, shaitan, refers, unilaterally, to, forces, of, evil, including, the, devil, iblis, who, causes, mischief, shaitan, is, also, linked, to, humans, psychological, nature, appearing, in, dreams, causing, anger, or, interrupting, the, mental, preparation, for, prayer, furthermore, the, term, shaitan, also, refers, to, beings, who, follow, the, evil, suggestions, of, iblis, also, the, principle, of, shaitan, is, in, many, ways, a, symbol, of, spiritual, impurity, representing, humans, own, deficits, in, contrast, to, a, true, muslim, who, is, free, from, anger, lust, and, other, devilish, desires, in, muslim, culture, devils, are, believed, to, be, hermaphrodite, creatures, created, from, hell, fire, with, one, male, and, one, female, thigh, and, able, to, procreate, without, a, mate, it, is, generally, believed, that, devils, can, harm, the, souls, of, humans, through, their, whisperings, while, whisperings, tempt, humans, to, sin, the, devils, might, enter, the, hearth, qalb, of, an, individual, if, the, devils, take, over, the, soul, of, a, person, this, would, render, them, aggressive, or, insane, in, extreme, cases, the, alterings, of, the, soul, are, believed, to, have, effect, on, the, body, matching, its, spiritual, qualities, in, contrast, to, occidental, philosophy, the, sufi, idea, of, seeing, many, as, one, and, considering, the, creation, in, its, essence, as, the, absolute, leads, to, the, idea, of, the, dissolution, of, any, dualism, between, the, ego, substance, and, the, external, substantial, objects, the, rebellion, against, god, mentioned, in, the, quran, takes, place, on, the, level, of, the, psyche, that, must, be, trained, and, disciplined, for, its, union, with, the, spirit, that, is, pure, since, psyche, drives, the, body, flesh, is, not, the, obstacle, to, humans, but, rather, an, unawareness, that, allows, the, impulsive, forces, to, cause, rebellion, against, god, on, the, level, of, the, psyche, yet, it, is, not, a, dualism, between, body, psyche, and, spirit, since, the, spirit, embraces, both, psyche, and, corporeal, aspects, of, humanity, since, the, world, is, held, to, be, the, mirror, in, which, god, s, attributes, are, reflected, participation, in, worldly, affairs, is, not, necessarily, seen, as, opposed, to, god, the, devil, activates, the, selfish, desires, of, the, psyche, leading, the, human, astray, from, the, divine, thus, it, is, the, i, that, is, regarded, as, evil, and, both, iblis, and, pharao, are, present, as, symbols, for, uttering, i, in, ones, own, behavior, therefore, it, is, recommended, to, use, the, term, i, as, little, as, possible, it, is, only, god, who, has, the, right, to, say, i, since, it, is, only, god, who, is, self, subsistent, uttering, i, is, therefore, a, way, to, compare, oneself, to, god, regarded, as, shirk, salafi, strands, of, islam, commonly, emphasize, a, dualistic, worldview, contrasting, believers, and, unbelievers, and, featuring, the, devil, as, the, enemy, of, the, faithful, who, tries, to, lead, them, astray, from, god, s, path, even, though, the, devil, will, eventually, be, defeated, by, god, he, remains, a, serious, and, dangerous, opponent, of, humans, while, in, classical, hadiths, the, demons, shayateen, and, the, jinn, are, responsible, for, impurity, and, capable, of, endangering, human, souls, in, salafi, thought, it, is, the, devil, himself, who, lies, in, wait, for, believers, always, striving, to, lure, them, away, from, god, the, devil, is, regarded, as, an, omnipresent, entity, permanently, inciting, humans, into, sin, but, can, be, pushed, away, by, remembering, the, name, god, the, devil, is, regarded, as, an, external, entity, threatening, the, everyday, life, of, the, believer, even, in, social, aspects, of, life, thus, for, example, it, is, the, devil, who, is, responsible, for, western, emancipation, yahweh, the, god, in, pre, exilic, judaism, created, both, good, and, evil, as, stated, in, isaiah, 45, 7, i, form, the, light, and, create, darkness, i, make, peace, and, create, evil, i, the, lord, do, all, these, things, the, devil, does, not, exist, in, jewish, scriptures, however, the, influence, of, zoroastrianism, during, the, achaemenid, empire, introduced, evil, as, a, separate, principle, into, the, jewish, belief, system, which, gradually, externalized, the, opposition, until, the, hebrew, term, satan, developed, into, a, specific, type, of, supernatural, entity, changing, the, monistic, view, of, judaism, into, a, dualistic, one, later, rabbinic, judaism, rejected, the, enochian, books, written, during, the, second, temple, period, under, persian, influence, which, depicted, the, devil, as, an, independent, force, of, evil, besides, god, after, the, apocalyptic, period, references, to, satan, in, the, tanakh, are, thought, to, be, allegorical, in, mandaean, mythology, ruha, fell, apart, from, the, world, of, light, and, became, the, queen, of, the, world, of, darkness, also, referred, to, as, sheol, she, is, considered, evil, and, a, liar, sorcerer, and, seductress, 541, she, gives, birth, to, ur, also, referred, to, as, leviathan, he, is, portrayed, as, a, large, ferocious, dragon, or, snake, and, is, considered, the, king, of, the, world, of, darkness, together, they, rule, the, underworld, and, create, the, seven, planets, and, twelve, zodiac, constellations, also, found, in, the, underworld, is, krun, the, greatest, of, the, five, mandaean, lords, of, the, underworld, he, dwells, in, the, lowest, depths, of, creation, and, his, epithet, is, the, mountain, of, flesh, 251, prominent, infernal, beings, found, in, the, world, of, darkness, include, lilith, nalai, vampire, niuli, hobgoblin, latabi, devil, gadalta, ghost, satani, satan, and, various, other, demons, and, evil, spirits, in, manichaeism, god, and, the, devil, are, two, unrelated, principles, god, created, good, and, inhabits, the, realm, of, light, while, the, devil, also, called, the, prince, of, darkness, created, evil, and, inhabits, the, kingdom, of, darkness, the, contemporary, world, came, into, existence, when, the, kingdom, of, darkness, assaulted, the, kingdom, of, light, and, mingled, with, the, spiritual, world, at, the, end, the, devil, and, his, followers, will, be, sealed, forever, and, the, kingdom, of, light, and, the, kingdom, of, darkness, will, continue, to, co, exist, eternally, never, to, commingle, again, hegemonius, 4th, century, ce, accuses, that, the, persian, prophet, mani, founder, of, the, manichaean, sect, in, the, 3rd, century, ce, identified, jehovah, as, the, devil, god, which, created, the, world, and, said, that, he, who, spoke, with, moses, the, jews, and, the, priests, is, the, of, darkness, not, the, god, of, truth, among, the, tengristic, myths, of, central, asia, erlik, refers, to, a, devil, like, figure, as, the, ruler, of, tamag, hell, who, was, also, the, first, human, according, to, one, narrative, erlik, and, god, swam, together, over, the, primordial, waters, when, god, was, about, to, create, the, earth, he, sent, erlik, to, dive, into, the, waters, and, collect, some, mud, erlik, hid, some, inside, his, mouth, to, later, create, his, own, world, but, when, god, commanded, the, earth, to, expand, erlik, got, troubled, by, the, mud, in, his, mouth, god, aided, erlik, to, spit, it, out, the, mud, carried, by, erlik, gave, place, to, the, unpleasant, areas, of, the, world, because, of, his, sin, he, was, assigned, to, evil, in, another, variant, the, creator, god, is, identified, with, ulgen, again, erlik, appears, to, be, the, first, human, he, desired, to, create, a, human, just, as, ulgen, did, thereupon, ulgen, reacted, by, punishing, erlik, casting, him, into, the, underworld, where, he, becomes, its, ruler, according, to, tengrism, there, is, no, death, meaning, that, when, life, comes, to, an, end, it, is, merely, a, transition, into, the, invisible, world, as, the, ruler, of, hell, erlik, enslaves, the, souls, who, are, damned, to, hell, further, he, lurks, on, the, souls, of, those, humans, living, on, earth, by, causing, death, disease, and, illnesses, at, the, time, of, birth, erlik, sends, a, kormos, to, seize, the, soul, of, the, newborn, following, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, an, attempt, to, seize, his, soul, by, hampering, misguiding, and, injuring, him, when, erlik, succeeds, in, destroying, a, human, s, body, the, kormos, sent, by, erlik, will, try, take, him, down, into, the, underworld, however, a, good, soul, will, be, brought, to, paradise, by, a, yayutshi, sent, by, ulgen, some, shamans, also, made, sacrifices, to, erlik, for, gaining, a, higher, rank, in, the, underworld, if, they, should, be, damned, to, hell, according, to, yazidism, there, is, no, entity, that, represents, evil, in, opposition, to, god, such, dualism, is, rejected, by, yazidis, and, evil, is, regarded, as, nonexistent, yazidis, adhere, to, strict, monism, and, are, prohibited, from, uttering, the, word, devil, and, from, speaking, of, anything, related, to, hell, zoroastrianism, probably, introduced, the, first, idea, of, the, devil, a, principle, of, evil, independently, existing, apart, from, god, in, zoroastrianism, good, and, evil, derive, from, two, ultimately, opposed, forces, the, force, of, good, is, called, ahura, mazda, and, the, destructive, spirit, in, the, avestan, language, is, called, angra, mainyu, the, middle, persian, equivalent, is, ahriman, they, are, in, eternal, struggle, and, neither, is, all, powerful, especially, angra, mainyu, is, limited, to, space, and, time, in, the, end, of, time, he, will, be, finally, defeated, while, ahura, mazda, creates, what, is, good, angra, mainyu, is, responsible, for, every, evil, and, suffering, in, the, world, such, as, toads, and, scorpions, iranian, zoroastrians, also, considered, the, daeva, as, devil, creature, because, of, this, in, the, shahnameh, it, is, mentioned, as, both, ahriman, div, persian, romanized, ahriman, div, as, a, devil, a, non, published, manuscript, of, spinoza, s, ethics, contained, a, chapter, chapter, xxi, on, the, devil, where, spinoza, examined, whether, the, devil, may, exist, or, not, he, defines, the, devil, as, an, entity, which, is, contrary, to, god, 46, 150, however, if, the, devil, is, the, opposite, of, god, the, devil, would, consist, of, nothingness, which, does, not, exist, 145, in, a, paper, called, on, devils, he, writes, that, we, can, a, priori, find, out, that, such, a, thing, cannot, exist, because, the, duration, of, a, thing, results, in, its, degree, of, perfection, and, the, more, essence, a, thing, possess, the, more, lasting, it, is, and, since, the, devil, has, no, perfection, at, all, it, is, impossible, for, the, devil, to, be, an, existing, thing, 72, evil, or, immoral, behaviour, in, humans, such, as, anger, hate, envy, and, all, things, for, which, the, devil, is, blamed, for, could, be, explained, without, the, proposal, of, a, devil, 145, thus, the, devil, does, not, have, any, explanatory, power, and, should, be, dismissed, occam, s, razor, regarding, evil, through, free, choice, spinoza, asks, how, it, can, be, that, adam, would, have, chosen, sin, over, his, own, well, being, theology, traditionally, responds, to, this, by, asserting, it, is, the, devil, who, tempts, humans, into, sin, but, who, would, have, tempted, the, devil, according, to, spinoza, a, rational, being, such, as, the, devil, must, have, been, could, not, choose, his, own, damnation, the, devil, must, have, known, his, sin, would, lead, to, doom, thus, the, devil, was, not, knowing, or, the, devil, did, not, know, his, sin, will, lead, to, doom, thus, the, devil, would, not, have, been, a, rational, being, spinoza, deducts, a, strict, determinism, in, which, moral, agency, as, a, free, choice, cannot, exist, 150, in, religion, within, the, limits, of, reason, alone, immanuel, kant, uses, the, devil, as, the, personification, of, maximum, moral, reprehensibility, deviating, from, the, common, christian, idea, kant, does, not, locate, the, morally, reprehensible, in, sensual, urges, since, evil, has, to, be, intelligible, only, when, the, sensual, is, consciously, placed, above, the, moral, obligation, can, something, be, regarded, as, morally, evil, thus, to, be, evil, the, devil, must, be, able, to, comprehend, morality, but, consciously, reject, it, and, as, a, spiritual, being, geistwesen, having, no, relation, to, any, form, of, sensual, pleasure, it, is, necessarily, required, for, the, devil, to, be, a, spiritual, being, because, if, the, devil, were, also, a, sensual, being, it, would, be, possible, that, the, devil, does, evil, to, satisfy, lower, sensual, desires, and, does, not, act, from, the, mind, alone, the, devil, acts, against, morals, not, to, satisfy, sensual, lust, but, solely, for, the, sake, of, evil, as, such, the, devil, is, unselfish, for, he, does, not, benefit, from, his, evil, deeds, however, kant, denies, that, a, human, being, could, ever, be, completely, devilish, kant, admits, that, there, are, devilish, vices, ingratitude, envy, and, malicious, joy, i, e, vices, that, do, not, bring, any, personal, advantage, but, a, person, can, never, be, completely, a, devil, in, his, lecture, on, moral, philosophy, 1774, 75, kant, gives, an, example, of, a, tulip, seller, who, was, in, possession, of, a, rare, tulip, but, when, he, learned, that, another, seller, had, the, same, tulip, he, bought, it, from, him, and, then, destroyed, it, instead, of, keeping, it, for, himself, if, he, had, acted, according, to, his, sensual, urges, the, seller, would, have, kept, the, tulip, for, himself, to, make, a, profit, but, not, have, destroyed, it, nevertheless, the, destruction, of, the, tulip, cannot, be, completely, absolved, from, sensual, impulses, since, a, sensual, joy, or, relief, still, accompanies, the, destruction, of, the, tulip, and, therefore, cannot, be, thought, of, solely, as, a, violation, of, morality, 156, 173, kant, further, argues, that, a, spiritual, devil, would, be, a, contradiction, if, the, devil, would, be, defined, by, doing, evil, the, devil, had, no, free, choice, in, the, first, place, but, if, the, devil, had, no, free, choice, the, devil, could, not, have, been, held, accountable, for, his, actions, since, he, had, no, free, will, but, was, only, following, his, nature, honorifics, or, styles, of, address, used, to, indicate, devil, figures, opinion, polls, show, that, belief, in, the, devil, in, western, countries, is, more, common, in, the, united, states, where, it, is, more, common, among, the, religious, regular, church, goers, political, conservatives, and, the, older, and, less, well, educated, but, has, declined, in, recent, decades
