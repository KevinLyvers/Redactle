windows, to, increase, producing, brighter, and, lighter, interiors, nave, ceilings, rose, and, pillars, and, steeples, heightened, many, architects, used, these, developments, to, push, the, limits, of, structural, possibility, an, inclination, that, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, several, towers, whose, designs, that, had, unwittingly, exceeded, the, boundaries, of, soundness, in, germany, the, netherlands, and, spain, it, became, popular, to, build, hall, churches, a, style, in, which, every, vault, would, be, built, to, the, same, height, gothic, cathedrals, were, lavishly, designed,

style, was, first, used, in, italy, around, 1575, from, there, it, spread, to, the, rest, of, europe, and, the, european, colonies, the, building, industry, increased, heavily, during, the, baroque, era, buildings, even, churches, were, used, to, indicate, wealth, authority, and, influence, the, use, of, forms, known, from, the, renaissance, was, extremely, exaggerated, domes, and, capitals, were, decorated, with, moulding, and, the, former, stucco, sculptures, were, replaced, by, fresco, paintings, on, the, ceilings, for, the, first, time, churches, were, seen, as, one, connected, work, of, art, and, consistent, artistic, concepts, were, developed, instead, of, long, buildings, more, central, plan, buildings, were, created, the, sprawling, decoration, with, floral, ornamentation, and, mythological, motives, lasted, until, about, 1720, in, the, rococo, era, the, protestant, parishes, preferred, lateral, churches, in, which, all, the, visitors, could, be, as, close, as, possible, to, the, pulpit, and, the, altar, a, common, trait, of, the, architecture, of, many, churches, is, the, shape, of, a, cross, a, long, central, rectangle, with, side, rectangles, and, a, rectangle, in, front, for, the, altar, space, or, sanctuary, these, churches, also, often, have, a, dome, or, other, large, vaulted, space, in, the, interior, to, represent, or, draw, attention, to,
