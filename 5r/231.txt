baptism, from, koin, greek, romanized, v, ptisma, lit, immersion, dipping, in, water, is, a, christian, sacrament, of, initiation, almost, invariably, with, the, use, of, water, it, may, be, performed, by, sprinkling, or, pouring, water, on, the, head, or, by, immersing, in, water, either, partially, or, completely, traditionally, three, times, once, for, each, person, of, the, trinity, the, synoptic, gospels, recount, that, john, the, baptist, baptised, jesus, baptism, is, considered, a, sacrament, in, most, churches, and, as, an, ordinance, in, others, baptism, according, to, the, trinitarian, formula, which, is, done, in, most, mainstream, christian, denominations, is, seen, as, being, a, basis, for, christian, ecumenism, the, concept, of, unity, amongst, christians, baptism, is, also, called, christening, although, some, reserve, the, word, christening, for, the, baptism, of, infants, in, certain, christian, denominations, such, as, the, catholic, churches, eastern, orthodox, churches, oriental, orthodox, churches, assyrian, church, of, the, east, and, lutheran, churches, baptism, is, the, door, to, church, membership, with, candidates, taking, baptismal, vows, it, has, also, given, its, name, to, the, baptist, churches, and, denominations, certain, schools, of, christian, thought, such, as, catholic, and, lutheran, theology, regard, baptism, as, necessary, for, salvation, but, some, writers, such, as, huldrych, zwingli, 1484, 1531, have, denied, its, necessity, though, water, baptism, is, extremely, common, among, christian, denominations, some, such, as, quakers, and, the, salvation, army, do, not, practice, water, baptism, at, all, among, denominations, that, practice, baptism, differences, occur, in, the, manner, and, mode, of, baptizing, and, in, the, understanding, of, the, significance, of, the, rite, most, christians, baptize, using, the, trinitarian, formula, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, following, the, great, commission, but, oneness, pentecostals, baptize, using, jesus, name, only, the, majority, of, christians, baptize, infants, many, others, such, as, baptist, churches, regard, only, believer, s, baptism, as, true, baptism, in, certain, denominations, such, as, the, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, individual, being, baptized, receives, a, cross, necklace, that, is, worn, for, the, rest, of, their, life, inspired, by, the, sixth, ecumenical, council, synod, of, constantinople, outside, of, christianity, mandaeans, undergo, repeated, baptism, for, purification, instead, of, initiation, they, consider, john, the, baptist, to, be, their, greatest, prophet, and, name, all, rivers, yardena, after, the, river, jordan, 45, the, term, baptism, has, also, been, used, metaphorically, to, refer, to, any, ceremony, trial, or, experience, by, which, a, person, is, initiated, purified, or, given, a, name, martyrdom, was, identified, early, in, christian, church, history, as, baptism, by, blood, enabling, the, salvation, of, martyrs, who, had, not, been, baptized, by, water, later, the, catholic, church, identified, a, baptism, of, desire, by, which, those, preparing, for, baptism, who, die, before, actually, receiving, the, sacrament, are, considered, saved, in, the, methodist, tradition, baptism, with, the, holy, spirit, has, referred, to, the, second, work, of, grace, entire, sanctification, in, pentecostalism, the, term, baptism, with, the, holy, spirit, is, identified, with, speaking, in, tongues, the, english, word, baptism, is, derived, indirectly, through, latin, from, the, neuter, greek, concept, noun, b, ptisma, greek, washing, dipping, which, is, a, neologism, in, the, new, testament, derived, from, the, masculine, greek, noun, baptism, s, a, term, for, ritual, washing, in, greek, language, texts, of, hellenistic, judaism, during, the, second, temple, period, such, as, the, septuagint, both, of, these, nouns, are, derived, from, the, verb, bapt, z, i, wash, transitive, verb, which, is, used, in, jewish, texts, for, ritual, washing, and, in, the, new, testament, both, for, ritual, washing, and, also, for, the, apparently, new, rite, of, b, ptisma, the, greek, verb, b, pt, dip, from, which, the, verb, bapt, z, is, derived, is, in, turn, hypothetically, traced, to, a, reconstructed, indo, european, root, g, abh, dip, the, greek, words, are, used, in, a, great, variety, of, meanings, and, in, hellenism, had, the, general, usage, of, immersion, going, under, as, a, material, in, a, liquid, dye, or, perishing, as, in, a, ship, sinking, or, a, person, drowning, with, the, same, double, meanings, as, in, english, to, sink, into, or, to, be, overwhelmed, by, with, bathing, or, washing, only, occasionally, used, and, usually, in, sacral, contexts, the, practice, of, baptism, emerged, from, jewish, ritualistic, practices, during, the, second, temple, period, out, of, which, figures, such, as, john, the, baptist, emerged, for, example, various, texts, in, the, dead, sea, scrolls, dss, corpus, at, qumran, describe, ritual, practices, involving, washing, bathing, sprinkling, and, immersing, one, example, of, such, a, text, is, a, dss, known, as, the, rule, of, the, community, which, says, and, by, the, compliance, of, his, soul, with, all, the, laws, of, god, his, flesh, is, cleansed, by, being, sprinkled, with, cleansing, waters, and, being, made, holy, with, the, waters, of, repentance, the, mandaeans, who, are, followers, of, john, the, baptist, practice, frequent, full, immersion, baptism, masbuta, as, a, ritual, of, purification, according, to, mandaean, sources, they, left, the, jordan, valley, in, the, 1st, century, ad, john, the, baptist, who, is, considered, a, forerunner, to, christianity, used, baptism, as, the, central, sacrament, of, his, messianic, movement, the, apostle, paul, distinguished, between, the, baptism, of, john, baptism, of, repentance, and, baptism, in, the, name, of, jesus, and, it, is, questionable, whether, christian, baptism, was, in, some, way, linked, with, that, of, john, however, according, to, mark, 1, 8, john, seems, to, connect, his, water, baptism, as, a, type, of, the, true, ultimate, baptism, of, jesus, which, is, by, the, spirit, christians, consider, jesus, to, have, instituted, the, sacrament, of, baptism, though, some, form, of, immersion, was, likely, the, most, common, method, of, baptism, in, the, early, church, many, of, the, writings, from, the, ancient, church, appeared, to, view, this, mode, of, baptism, as, inconsequential, the, didache, 7, 1, 3, ad, 60, 150, allowed, for, affusion, practices, in, situations, where, immersion, was, not, practical, likewise, tertullian, ad, 196, 212, allowed, for, varying, approaches, to, baptism, even, if, those, practices, did, not, conform, to, biblical, or, traditional, mandates, cf, de, corona, militis, 3, de, baptismo, 17, finally, cyprian, ca, ad, 256, explicitly, stated, that, the, amount, of, water, was, inconsequential, and, defended, immersion, affusion, and, aspersion, practices, epistle, 75, 12, as, a, result, there, was, no, uniform, or, consistent, mode, of, baptism, in, the, ancient, church, prior, to, the, fourth, century, by, the, third, and, fourth, centuries, baptism, involved, catechetical, instruction, as, well, as, chrismation, exorcisms, laying, on, of, hands, and, recitation, of, a, creed, in, the, early, middle, ages, infant, baptism, became, common, and, the, rite, was, significantly, simplified, and, increasingly, emphasized, in, western, europe, affusion, became, the, normal, mode, of, baptism, between, the, twelfth, and, fourteenth, centuries, though, immersion, was, still, practiced, into, the, sixteenth, in, the, medieval, period, some, radical, christians, rejected, the, practice, of, baptism, as, a, sacrament, sects, such, as, the, tondrakians, cathars, arnoldists, petrobrusians, henricans, brethren, of, the, free, spirit, and, the, lollards, were, regarded, as, heretics, by, the, catholic, church, in, the, sixteenth, century, martin, luther, retained, baptism, as, a, sacrament, but, swiss, reformer, huldrych, zwingli, considered, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, to, be, symbolic, anabaptists, denied, the, validity, of, the, practice, of, infant, baptism, and, rebaptized, converts, baptism, is, practiced, in, several, different, ways, aspersion, is, the, sprinkling, of, water, on, the, head, and, affusion, is, the, pouring, of, water, over, the, head, traditionally, a, person, is, sprinkled, poured, or, immersed, three, times, for, each, person, of, the, holy, trinity, with, this, ancient, christian, practice, called, trine, baptism, or, triune, baptism, the, didache, specifies, this, is, how, you, should, baptize, having, recited, all, these, things, baptize, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, in, running, water, if, you, do, not, have, running, water, then, baptize, in, still, water, the, water, should, be, cold, but, if, you, do, not, have, cold, water, then, use, warm, if, you, have, neither, then, just, pour, water, on, the, head, three, times, in, the, name, of, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, both, the, one, who, is, baptized, and, the, one, who, baptizes, should, fast, beforehand, along, with, any, others, who, are, able, the, one, that, is, baptized, being, told, to, fast, for, a, day, or, two, the, word, immersion, is, derived, from, late, latin, immersio, a, noun, derived, from, the, verb, immergere, in, into, mergere, dip, in, relation, to, baptism, some, use, it, to, refer, to, any, form, of, dipping, whether, the, body, is, put, completely, under, water, or, is, only, partly, dipped, in, water, they, thus, speak, of, immersion, as, being, either, total, or, partial, others, of, the, anabaptist, belief, use, immersion, to, mean, exclusively, plunging, someone, entirely, under, the, surface, of, the, water, the, term, immersion, is, also, used, of, a, form, of, baptism, in, which, water, is, poured, over, someone, standing, in, water, without, submersion, of, the, person, on, these, three, meanings, of, the, word, immersion, see, immersion, baptism, when, immersion, is, used, in, opposition, to, submersion, it, indicates, the, form, of, baptism, in, which, the, candidate, stands, or, kneels, in, water, and, water, is, poured, over, the, upper, part, of, the, body, immersion, in, this, sense, has, been, employed, in, west, and, east, since, at, least, the, 2nd, century, and, is, the, form, in, which, baptism, is, generally, depicted, in, early, christian, art, in, the, west, this, method, of, baptism, began, to, be, replaced, by, affusion, baptism, from, around, the, 8th, century, but, it, continues, in, use, in, eastern, christianity, the, word, submersion, comes, from, the, late, latin, sub, under, below, mergere, plunge, dip, and, is, also, sometimes, called, complete, immersion, it, is, the, form, of, baptism, in, which, the, water, completely, covers, the, candidate, s, body, submersion, is, practiced, in, the, orthodox, and, several, other, eastern, churches, in, the, latin, church, of, the, catholic, church, baptism, by, submersion, is, used, in, the, ambrosian, rite, and, is, one, of, the, methods, provided, in, the, roman, rite, of, the, baptism, of, infants, it, is, seen, as, obligatory, among, some, groups, that, have, arisen, since, the, protestant, reformation, such, as, baptists, the, greek, english, lexicon, of, liddell, and, scott, gives, the, primary, meaning, of, the, verb, bapt, zein, from, which, the, english, verb, baptize, is, derived, as, dip, plunge, and, gives, examples, of, plunging, a, sword, into, a, throat, or, an, embryo, and, for, drawing, wine, by, dipping, a, cup, in, the, bowl, for, new, testament, usage, it, gives, two, meanings, baptize, with, which, it, associates, the, septuagint, mention, of, naaman, dipping, himself, in, the, jordan, river, and, perform, ablutions, as, in, luke, 11, 38, although, the, greek, verb, bapt, zein, does, not, exclusively, mean, dip, plunge, or, immerse, it, is, used, with, literal, and, figurative, meanings, such, as, sink, disable, overwhelm, go, under, overborne, draw, from, a, bowl, lexical, sources, typically, cite, this, as, a, meaning, of, the, word, in, both, the, septuagint, and, the, new, testament, while, it, is, true, that, the, basic, root, meaning, of, the, greek, words, for, baptize, and, baptism, is, immerse, immersion, it, is, not, true, that, the, words, can, simply, be, reduced, to, this, meaning, as, can, be, seen, from, mark, 10, 38, 39, luke, 12, 50, matthew, 3, 11, luke, 3, 16, and, corinthians10, 2, two, passages, in, the, gospels, indicate, that, the, verb, bapt, zein, did, not, always, indicate, submersion, the, first, is, luke, 11, 38, which, tells, how, a, pharisee, at, whose, house, jesus, ate, was, astonished, to, see, that, he, did, not, first, wash, aorist, passive, of, literally, was, baptized, before, dinner, this, is, the, passage, that, liddell, and, scott, cites, as, an, instance, of, the, use, of, to, mean, perform, ablutions, jesus, omission, of, this, action, is, similar, to, that, of, his, disciples, then, came, to, jesus, scribes, and, pharisees, which, were, of, jerusalem, saying, why, do, thy, disciples, transgress, the, tradition, of, the, elders, for, they, wash, not, their, hands, when, they, eat, bread, the, other, gospel, passage, pointed, to, is, the, pharisees, do, not, eat, unless, they, wash, the, ordinary, word, for, washing, their, hands, thoroughly, observing, the, tradition, of, the, elders, and, when, they, come, from, the, market, place, they, do, not, eat, unless, they, wash, themselves, literally, baptize, themselves, passive, or, middle, voice, of, scholars, of, various, denominations, claim, that, these, two, passages, show, that, invited, guests, or, people, returning, from, market, would, not, be, expected, to, immerse, themselves, baptize, themselves, totally, in, water, but, only, to, practise, the, partial, immersion, of, dipping, their, hands, in, water, or, to, pour, water, over, them, as, is, the, only, form, admitted, by, present, jewish, custom, in, the, second, of, the, two, passages, it, is, actually, the, hands, that, are, specifically, identified, as, washed, not, the, entire, person, for, whom, the, verb, used, is, bapt, zomai, literally, be, baptized, be, immersed, a, fact, obscured, by, english, versions, that, use, wash, as, a, translation, of, both, verbs, zodhiates, concludes, that, the, washing, of, the, hands, was, done, by, immersing, them, the, liddell, scott, jones, greek, english, lexicon, 1996, cites, the, other, passage, luke, 11, 38, as, an, instance, of, the, use, of, the, verb, bapt, zein, to, mean, perform, ablutions, not, submerge, references, to, the, cleaning, of, vessels, which, use, also, refer, to, immersion, as, already, mentioned, the, lexicographical, work, of, zodhiates, says, that, in, the, second, of, these, two, cases, the, verb, bapt, zein, indicates, that, after, coming, from, the, market, the, pharisees, washed, their, hands, by, immersing, them, in, collected, water, balz, schneider, understand, the, meaning, of, used, in, place, of, sprinkle, to, be, the, same, as, to, dip, or, immerse, a, verb, used, of, the, partial, dipping, of, a, morsel, held, in, the, hand, into, wine, or, of, a, finger, into, spilled, blood, a, possible, additional, use, of, the, verb, bapt, zein, to, relate, to, ritual, washing, is, suggested, by, peter, leithart, 2007, who, suggests, that, paul, s, phrase, else, what, shall, they, do, who, are, baptized, for, the, dead, relates, to, jewish, ritual, washing, in, jewish, greek, the, verb, bapt, zein, baptized, has, a, wider, reference, than, just, baptism, and, in, jewish, context, primarily, applies, to, the, masculine, noun, baptism, s, ritual, washing, the, verb, bapt, zein, occurs, four, times, in, the, septuagint, in, the, context, of, ritual, washing, baptism, s, judith, cleansing, herself, from, menstrual, impurity, naaman, washing, seven, times, to, be, cleansed, from, leprosy, etc, additionally, in, the, new, testament, only, the, verb, bapt, zein, can, also, relate, to, the, neuter, noun, b, ptisma, baptism, which, is, a, neologism, unknown, in, the, septuagint, and, other, pre, christian, jewish, texts, this, broadness, in, the, meaning, of, bapt, zein, is, reflected, in, english, bibles, rendering, wash, where, jewish, ritual, washing, is, meant, for, example, mark, 7, 4, states, that, the, pharisees, except, they, wash, greek, baptize, they, do, not, eat, and, baptize, where, b, ptisma, the, new, christian, rite, is, intended, two, nouns, derived, from, the, verb, bapt, z, appear, in, the, new, testament, the, masculine, noun, baptism, s, and, the, neuter, noun, b, ptisma, until, the, middle, ages, most, baptisms, were, performed, with, the, candidates, naked, as, is, evidenced, by, most, of, the, early, portrayals, of, baptism, some, of, which, are, shown, in, this, article, and, the, early, church, fathers, and, other, christian, writers, deaconesses, helped, female, candidates, for, reasons, of, modesty, typical, of, these, is, cyril, of, jerusalem, who, wrote, on, the, mysteries, of, baptism, in, the, 4th, century, c, 350, ad, do, you, not, know, that, so, many, of, us, as, were, baptized, into, jesus, christ, were, baptized, into, his, death, etc, for, you, are, not, under, the, law, but, under, grace, 1, therefore, i, shall, necessarily, lay, before, you, the, sequel, of, yesterday, s, lecture, that, you, may, learn, of, what, those, things, which, were, done, by, you, in, the, inner, chamber, were, symbolic, 2, as, soon, then, as, you, entered, you, put, off, your, tunic, and, this, was, an, image, of, putting, off, the, old, man, with, his, deeds, having, stripped, yourselves, you, were, naked, in, this, also, imitating, christ, who, was, stripped, naked, on, the, cross, and, by, his, nakedness, put, off, from, himself, the, principalities, and, powers, and, openly, triumphed, over, them, on, the, tree, for, since, the, adverse, powers, made, their, lair, in, your, members, you, may, no, longer, wear, that, old, garment, i, do, not, at, all, mean, this, visible, one, but, the, old, man, which, waxes, corrupt, in, the, lusts, of, deceit, may, the, soul, which, has, once, put, him, off, never, again, put, him, on, but, say, with, the, spouse, of, christ, in, the, song, of, songs, i, have, put, off, my, garment, how, shall, i, put, it, on, o, wondrous, thing, you, were, naked, in, the, sight, of, all, and, were, not, ashamed, for, truly, ye, bore, the, likeness, of, the, first, formed, adam, who, was, naked, in, the, garden, and, was, not, ashamed, 3, then, when, you, were, stripped, you, were, anointed, with, exorcised, oil, from, the, very, hairs, of, your, head, to, your, feet, and, were, made, partakers, of, the, good, olive, tree, jesus, christ, 4, after, these, things, you, were, led, to, the, holy, pool, of, divine, baptism, as, christ, was, carried, from, the, cross, to, the, sepulchre, which, is, before, our, eyes, and, each, of, you, was, asked, whether, he, believed, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, ghost, and, you, made, that, saving, confession, and, descended, three, times, into, the, water, and, ascended, again, here, also, hinting, by, a, symbol, at, the, three, days, burial, of, christ, and, at, the, self, same, moment, you, were, both, dying, and, being, born, the, symbolism, is, threefold, 1, baptism, is, considered, to, be, a, form, of, rebirth, by, water, and, the, spirit, the, nakedness, of, baptism, the, second, birth, paralleled, the, condition, of, one, s, original, birth, for, example, john, chrysostom, calls, the, baptism, i, e, giving, birth, and, new, way, of, creation, from, water, and, spirit, to, john, speech, 25, 2, and, later, elaborates, for, nothing, perceivable, was, handed, over, to, us, by, jesus, but, with, perceivable, things, all, of, them, however, conceivable, this, is, also, the, way, with, the, baptism, the, gift, of, the, water, is, done, with, a, perceivable, thing, but, the, things, being, conducted, i, e, the, rebirth, and, renovation, are, conceivable, for, if, you, were, without, a, body, he, would, hand, over, these, bodiless, gifts, as, naked, to, you, but, because, the, soul, is, closely, linked, to, the, body, he, hands, over, the, perceivable, ones, to, you, with, conceivable, things, chrysostom, to, matthew, speech, 82, 4, c, 390, a, d, 2, the, removal, of, clothing, represented, the, image, of, putting, off, the, old, man, with, his, deeds, as, per, cyril, above, so, the, stripping, of, the, body, before, for, baptism, represented, taking, off, the, trappings, of, sinful, self, so, that, the, new, man, which, is, given, by, jesus, can, be, put, on, 3, as, cyril, again, asserts, above, as, adam, and, eve, in, scripture, were, naked, innocent, and, unashamed, in, the, garden, of, eden, nakedness, during, baptism, was, seen, as, a, renewal, of, that, innocence, and, state, of, original, sinlessness, other, parallels, can, also, be, drawn, such, as, between, the, exposed, condition, of, christ, during, his, crucifixion, and, the, crucifixion, of, the, old, man, of, the, repentant, sinner, in, preparation, for, baptism, changing, customs, and, concerns, regarding, modesty, probably, contributed, to, the, practice, of, permitting, or, requiring, the, baptismal, candidate, to, either, retain, their, undergarments, as, in, many, renaissance, paintings, of, baptism, such, as, those, by, da, vinci, tintoretto, van, scorel, masaccio, de, wit, and, others, or, to, wear, as, is, almost, universally, the, practice, today, baptismal, robes, these, robes, are, most, often, white, symbolizing, purity, some, groups, today, allow, any, suitable, clothes, to, be, worn, such, as, trousers, and, a, t, shirt, practical, considerations, include, how, easily, the, clothes, will, dry, denim, is, discouraged, and, whether, they, will, become, see, through, when, wet, in, certain, christian, denominations, the, individual, being, baptized, receives, a, cross, necklace, that, is, worn, for, the, rest, of, their, life, as, a, sign, of, the, triumph, of, christ, over, death, and, our, belonging, to, christ, though, it, is, replaced, with, a, new, cross, pendant, if, lost, or, broken, this, practice, of, baptized, christians, wearing, a, cross, necklace, at, all, times, is, derived, from, canon, 73, and, canon, 82, of, the, sixth, ecumenical, council, synod, of, constantinople, which, declared, all, the, church, sunday, school, children, wear, a, cross, knowing, how, spiritually, beneficial, it, is, for, them, by, wearing, a, cross, the, child, is, protected, from, evil, forces, it, invites, the, grace, of, the, holy, cross, of, christ, it, brings, his, divine, blessing, upon, the, child, it, gives, the, child, a, sense, that, he, or, she, belongs, to, christ, that, he, or, she, has, a, special, identity, that, of, a, christian, it, is, a, reminder, that, christ, is, always, with, him, her, it, reminds, the, child, that, jesus, died, on, the, cross, to, save, him, her, that, jesus, christ, is, our, only, savior, and, the, true, god, by, wearing, a, cross, the, child, feels, the, love, of, god, and, gives, the, child, hope, and, strength, to, overcome, any, obstacle, in, his, or, her, life, there, are, differences, in, views, about, the, effect, of, baptism, for, a, christian, catholics, orthodox, and, most, mainline, protestant, groups, assert, baptism, is, a, requirement, for, salvation, and, a, sacrament, and, speak, of, baptismal, regeneration, its, importance, is, related, to, their, interpretation, of, the, meaning, of, the, mystical, body, of, christ, as, found, in, the, new, testament, this, view, is, shared, by, the, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, denominations, and, by, churches, formed, early, during, the, protestant, reformation, such, as, lutheran, and, anglican, for, example, martin, luther, said, to, put, it, most, simply, the, power, effect, benefit, fruit, and, purpose, of, baptism, is, to, save, no, one, is, baptized, in, order, to, become, a, prince, but, as, the, words, say, to, be, saved, to, be, saved, we, know, is, nothing, else, than, to, be, delivered, from, sin, death, and, the, devil, and, to, enter, into, the, kingdom, of, christ, and, live, with, him, forever, the, churches, of, christ, 66, 112, jehovah, s, witnesses, christadelphians, and, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, espouse, baptism, as, necessary, for, salvation, for, roman, catholics, baptism, by, water, is, a, sacrament, of, initiation, into, the, life, of, the, children, of, god, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, 1212, 13, it, configures, the, person, to, christ, ccc, 1272, and, obliges, the, christian, to, share, in, the, church, s, apostolic, and, missionary, activity, ccc, 1270, the, catholic, holds, that, there, are, three, types, of, baptism, by, which, one, can, be, saved, sacramental, baptism, with, water, baptism, of, desire, explicit, or, implicit, desire, to, be, part, of, the, church, founded, by, jesus, christ, and, baptism, of, blood, martyrdom, in, his, encyclical, mystici, corporis, christi, of, june, 29, 1943, pope, pius, xii, spoke, of, baptism, and, profession, of, the, true, faith, as, what, makes, members, of, the, one, true, church, which, is, the, body, of, jesus, christ, himself, as, god, the, holy, spirit, has, taught, through, the, apostle, paul, by, contrast, anabaptist, and, evangelical, protestants, recognize, baptism, as, an, outward, sign, of, an, inward, reality, following, on, an, individual, believer, s, experience, of, forgiving, grace, reformed, and, methodist, protestants, maintain, a, link, between, baptism, and, regeneration, but, insist, that, it, is, not, automatic, or, mechanical, and, that, regeneration, may, occur, at, a, different, time, than, baptism, churches, of, christ, consistently, teach, that, in, baptism, a, believer, surrenders, his, life, in, faith, and, obedience, to, god, and, that, god, by, the, merits, of, christ, s, blood, cleanses, one, from, sin, and, truly, changes, the, state, of, the, person, from, an, alien, to, a, citizen, of, god, s, kingdom, baptism, is, not, a, human, work, it, is, the, place, where, god, does, the, work, that, only, god, can, do, p, 66, thus, they, see, baptism, as, a, passive, act, of, faith, rather, than, a, meritorious, work, it, is, a, confession, that, a, person, has, nothing, to, offer, god, p, 112, the, liturgy, of, baptism, for, catholics, eastern, orthodox, lutherans, anglicans, and, methodists, makes, clear, reference, to, baptism, as, not, only, a, symbolic, burial, and, resurrection, but, an, actual, supernatural, transformation, one, that, draws, parallels, to, the, experience, of, noah, and, the, passage, of, the, israelites, through, the, red, sea, divided, by, moses, thus, baptism, is, literally, and, symbolically, not, only, cleansing, but, also, dying, and, rising, again, with, christ, catholics, believe, baptism, is, necessary, to, cleanse, the, taint, of, original, sin, and, so, commonly, baptise, infants, the, eastern, churches, eastern, orthodox, church, and, oriental, orthodoxy, also, baptize, infants, on, the, basis, of, texts, such, as, matthew, 19, 14, which, are, interpreted, as, supporting, full, church, membership, for, children, in, these, denominations, baptism, is, immediately, followed, by, chrismation, and, communion, at, the, next, divine, liturgy, regardless, of, age, orthodox, likewise, believe, that, baptism, removes, what, they, call, the, ancestral, sin, of, adam, anglicans, believe, that, baptism, is, also, the, entry, into, the, church, most, methodists, and, anglicans, agree, that, it, also, cleanses, the, taint, of, what, in, the, west, is, called, original, sin, in, the, east, ancestral, sin, eastern, orthodox, christians, usually, insist, on, complete, threefold, immersion, as, both, a, symbol, of, death, and, rebirth, into, christ, and, as, a, washing, away, of, sin, latin, church, catholics, generally, baptize, by, affusion, pouring, eastern, catholics, usually, by, submersion, or, at, least, partial, immersion, however, submersion, is, gaining, in, popularity, within, the, latin, catholic, church, in, newer, church, sanctuaries, the, baptismal, font, may, be, designed, to, expressly, allow, for, baptism, by, immersion, anglicans, baptize, by, immersion, or, affusion, according, to, evidence, which, can, be, traced, back, to, about, the, year, 200, sponsors, or, godparents, are, present, at, baptism, and, vow, to, uphold, the, christian, education, and, life, of, the, baptized, baptists, argue, that, the, greek, word, originally, meant, to, immerse, they, interpret, some, biblical, passages, concerning, baptism, as, requiring, submersion, of, the, body, in, water, they, also, state, that, only, submersion, reflects, the, symbolic, significance, of, being, buried, and, raised, with, christ, baptist, churches, baptize, in, the, name, of, the, trinity, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, however, they, do, not, believe, that, baptism, is, necessary, for, salvation, but, rather, that, it, is, an, act, of, christian, obedience, some, full, gospel, charismatic, churches, such, as, oneness, pentecostals, baptize, only, in, the, name, of, jesus, christ, citing, peter, s, preaching, baptism, in, the, name, of, jesus, as, their, authority, in, 1982, the, world, council, of, churches, published, the, ecumenical, paper, baptism, eucharist, and, ministry, the, preface, of, the, document, states, those, who, know, how, widely, the, churches, have, differed, in, doctrine, and, practice, on, baptism, eucharist, and, ministry, will, appreciate, the, importance, of, the, large, measure, of, agreement, registered, here, virtually, all, the, confessional, traditions, are, included, in, the, commission, s, membership, that, theologians, of, such, widely, different, denominations, should, be, able, to, speak, so, harmoniously, about, baptism, eucharist, and, ministry, is, unprecedented, in, the, modern, ecumenical, movement, particularly, noteworthy, is, the, fact, that, the, commission, also, includes, among, its, full, members, theologians, of, the, catholic, and, other, churches, which, do, not, belong, to, the, world, council, of, churches, itself, a, 1997, document, becoming, a, christian, the, ecumenical, implications, of, our, common, baptism, gave, the, views, of, a, commission, of, experts, brought, together, under, the, aegis, of, the, world, council, of, churches, it, states, according, to, acts, 2, 38, baptisms, follow, from, peter, s, preaching, baptism, in, the, name, of, jesus, and, lead, those, baptized, to, the, receiving, of, christ, s, spirit, the, holy, ghost, and, life, in, the, community, they, devoted, themselves, to, the, apostles, teaching, and, fellowship, to, the, breaking, of, bread, and, the, prayers, as, well, as, to, the, distribution, of, goods, to, those, in, need, those, who, heard, who, were, baptized, and, entered, the, community, s, life, were, already, made, witnesses, of, and, partakers, in, the, promises, of, god, for, the, last, days, the, forgiveness, of, sins, through, baptism, in, the, name, of, jesus, and, the, outpouring, of, the, holy, ghost, on, all, flesh, similarly, in, what, may, well, be, a, baptismal, pattern, 1, peter, testifies, that, proclamation, of, the, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, and, teaching, about, new, life, lead, to, purification, and, new, birth, this, in, turn, is, followed, by, eating, and, drinking, god, s, food, by, participation, in, the, life, of, the, community, the, royal, priesthood, the, new, temple, the, people, of, god, and, by, further, moral, formation, at, the, beginning, of, 1, peter, the, writer, sets, this, baptism, in, the, context, of, obedience, to, christ, and, sanctification, by, the, spirit, so, baptism, into, christ, is, seen, as, baptism, into, the, spirit, in, the, fourth, gospel, jesus, discourse, with, nicodemus, indicates, that, birth, by, water, and, spirit, becomes, the, gracious, means, of, entry, into, the, place, where, god, rules, the, vast, majority, of, christian, denominations, admit, the, theological, idea, that, baptism, is, a, sacrament, that, has, actual, spiritual, holy, and, salvific, effects, certain, key, criteria, must, be, complied, with, for, it, to, be, valid, i, e, to, actually, have, those, effects, if, these, key, criteria, are, met, violation, of, some, rules, regarding, baptism, such, as, varying, the, authorized, rite, for, the, ceremony, renders, the, baptism, illicit, contrary, to, the, church, s, laws, but, still, valid, one, of, the, criteria, for, validity, is, use, of, the, correct, form, of, words, the, roman, catholic, church, teaches, that, the, use, of, the, verb, to, baptize, is, essential, catholics, of, the, latin, church, anglicans, and, methodists, use, the, form, i, baptize, you, in, the, name, of, the, passive, voice, is, used, by, eastern, orthodox, and, byzantine, catholics, the, form, being, the, servant, of, god, is, baptized, in, the, name, of, use, of, the, trinitarian, formula, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, is, also, considered, essential, thus, these, churches, do, not, accept, as, valid, baptisms, of, non, trinitarian, churches, such, as, oneness, pentecostals, another, essential, condition, is, use, of, water, a, baptism, in, which, some, liquid, that, would, not, usually, be, called, water, such, as, wine, milk, soup, or, fruit, juice, was, used, would, not, be, considered, valid, another, requirement, is, that, the, celebrant, intends, to, perform, baptism, this, requirement, entails, merely, the, intention, to, do, what, the, church, does, not, necessarily, to, have, christian, faith, since, it, is, not, the, person, baptizing, but, the, holy, spirit, working, through, the, sacrament, who, produces, the, effects, of, the, sacrament, doubt, about, the, faith, of, the, baptizer, is, thus, no, ground, for, doubt, about, the, validity, of, the, baptism, some, conditions, expressly, do, not, affect, validity, for, example, whether, submersion, immersion, affusion, pouring, or, aspersion, sprinkling, is, used, however, if, water, is, sprinkled, there, is, a, danger, that, the, water, may, not, touch, the, skin, of, the, unbaptized, as, has, been, stated, it, is, not, sufficient, for, the, water, to, merely, touch, the, candidate, it, must, also, flow, otherwise, there, would, seem, to, be, no, real, ablution, at, best, such, a, baptism, would, be, considered, doubtful, if, the, water, touches, only, the, hair, the, sacrament, has, probably, been, validly, conferred, though, in, practice, the, safer, course, must, be, followed, if, only, the, clothes, of, the, person, have, received, the, aspersion, the, baptism, is, undoubtedly, void, for, many, communions, validity, is, not, affected, if, a, single, submersion, or, pouring, is, performed, rather, than, a, triple, but, in, orthodoxy, this, is, controversial, according, to, the, catholic, church, baptism, imparts, an, indelible, seal, upon, the, soul, of, the, baptized, and, therefore, a, person, who, has, already, been, baptized, cannot, be, validly, baptized, again, this, teaching, was, affirmed, against, the, donatists, who, practiced, rebaptism, the, grace, received, in, baptism, is, believed, to, operate, ex, opere, operato, and, is, therefore, considered, valid, even, if, administered, in, heretical, or, schismatic, groups, the, catholic, lutheran, anglican, presbyterian, and, methodist, churches, accept, baptism, performed, by, other, denominations, within, this, group, as, valid, subject, to, certain, conditions, including, the, use, of, the, trinitarian, formula, it, is, only, possible, to, be, baptized, once, so, people, with, valid, baptisms, from, other, denominations, may, not, be, baptized, again, upon, conversion, or, transfer, for, roman, catholics, this, is, affirmed, in, the, canon, law, 864, in, which, it, is, written, that, very, person, not, yet, baptized, and, only, such, a, person, is, capable, of, baptism, such, people, are, accepted, upon, making, a, profession, of, faith, and, if, they, have, not, yet, validly, received, the, sacrament, rite, of, confirmation, or, chrismation, by, being, confirmed, specifically, methodist, theologians, argued, that, since, god, never, abrogated, a, covenant, made, and, sealed, with, proper, intentionality, rebaptism, was, never, an, option, unless, the, original, baptism, had, been, defective, by, not, having, been, made, in, the, name, of, the, trinity, in, some, cases, it, can, be, difficult, to, decide, if, the, original, baptism, was, in, fact, valid, if, there, is, doubt, conditional, baptism, is, administered, with, a, formula, on, the, lines, of, if, you, are, not, yet, baptized, i, baptize, you, the, catholic, church, ordinarily, recognizes, as, valid, the, baptisms, of, christians, of, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, of, christ, congregationalist, anglican, lutheran, old, catholic, polish, national, catholic, reformed, baptist, brethren, methodist, presbyterian, waldensian, and, united, protestant, denominations, christians, of, these, traditions, are, received, into, the, catholic, church, through, the, sacrament, of, confirmation, some, individuals, of, the, mennonite, pentecostal, and, adventist, traditions, who, wish, to, be, received, into, the, catholic, church, may, be, required, to, receive, a, conditional, baptism, due, to, concerns, about, the, validity, of, the, sacraments, in, those, traditions, the, catholic, church, has, explicitly, denied, the, validity, of, the, baptism, conferred, in, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, reformed, churches, recognize, as, valid, baptisms, administered, in, the, catholic, church, among, other, churches, using, the, trinitarian, formula, practice, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, for, converts, from, other, communions, is, not, uniform, however, generally, baptisms, performed, in, the, name, of, the, holy, trinity, are, accepted, by, the, orthodox, christian, church, christians, of, the, oriental, orthodox, roman, catholic, lutheran, old, catholic, moravian, anglican, methodist, reformed, presbyterian, brethren, assemblies, of, god, or, baptist, traditions, can, be, received, into, the, eastern, orthodox, church, through, the, sacrament, of, chrismation, if, a, convert, has, not, received, the, sacrament, mysterion, of, baptism, he, or, she, must, be, baptised, in, the, name, of, the, holy, trinity, before, they, may, enter, into, communion, with, the, orthodox, church, if, he, she, has, been, baptized, in, another, christian, confession, other, than, orthodox, christianity, his, her, previous, baptism, is, considered, retroactively, filled, with, grace, by, chrismation, or, in, rare, circumstances, confession, of, faith, alone, as, long, as, the, baptism, was, done, in, the, name, of, the, holy, trinity, father, son, and, holy, spirit, the, exact, procedure, is, dependent, on, local, canons, and, is, the, subject, of, some, controversy, oriental, orthodox, churches, recognise, the, validity, of, baptisms, performed, within, the, eastern, orthodox, communion, some, also, recognise, baptisms, performed, by, catholic, churches, any, supposed, baptism, not, performed, using, the, trinitarian, formula, is, considered, invalid, in, the, eyes, of, the, catholic, church, all, orthodox, churches, anglican, and, lutheran, churches, the, baptism, conferred, by, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, is, invalid, an, article, published, together, with, the, official, declaration, to, that, effect, gave, reasons, for, that, judgment, summed, up, in, the, following, words, the, baptism, of, the, catholic, church, and, that, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, differ, essentially, both, for, what, concerns, faith, in, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, in, whose, name, baptism, is, conferred, and, for, what, concerns, the, relationship, to, christ, who, instituted, it, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, stresses, that, baptism, must, be, administered, by, one, having, proper, authority, consequently, the, church, does, not, recognize, the, baptism, of, any, other, church, as, effective, jehovah, s, witnesses, do, not, recognise, any, other, baptism, occurring, after, 1914, as, valid, as, they, believe, that, they, are, now, the, one, true, church, of, christ, and, that, the, rest, of, christendom, is, false, religion, there, is, debate, among, christian, churches, as, to, who, can, administer, baptism, some, claim, that, the, examples, given, in, the, new, testament, only, show, apostles, and, deacons, administering, baptism, ancient, christian, churches, interpret, this, as, indicating, that, baptism, should, be, performed, by, the, clergy, except, in, extremis, i, e, when, the, one, being, baptized, is, in, immediate, danger, of, death, then, anyone, may, baptize, provided, in, the, view, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, person, who, does, the, baptizing, is, a, member, of, that, church, or, in, the, view, of, the, catholic, church, that, the, person, even, if, not, baptized, intends, to, do, what, the, church, does, in, administering, the, rite, many, protestant, churches, see, no, specific, prohibition, in, the, biblical, examples, and, permit, any, believer, to, baptize, another, in, the, roman, catholic, church, canon, law, for, the, latin, church, lays, down, that, the, ordinary, minister, of, baptism, is, a, bishop, priest, or, deacon, but, its, administration, is, one, of, the, functions, especially, entrusted, to, the, parish, priest, if, the, person, to, be, baptized, is, at, least, fourteen, years, old, that, person, s, baptism, is, to, be, referred, to, the, bishop, so, that, he, can, decide, whether, to, confer, the, baptism, himself, if, no, ordinary, minister, is, available, a, catechist, or, some, other, person, whom, the, local, ordinary, has, appointed, for, this, purpose, may, licitly, do, the, baptism, indeed, in, a, case, of, necessity, any, person, irrespective, of, that, person, s, religion, who, has, the, requisite, intention, may, confer, the, baptism, by, a, case, of, necessity, is, meant, imminent, danger, of, death, because, of, either, illness, or, an, external, threat, the, requisite, intention, is, at, the, minimum, level, the, intention, to, do, what, the, church, does, through, the, rite, of, baptism, in, the, eastern, catholic, churches, a, deacon, is, not, considered, an, ordinary, minister, administration, of, the, sacrament, is, reserved, to, the, parish, priest, or, to, another, priest, to, whom, he, or, the, local, hierarch, grants, permission, a, permission, that, can, be, presumed, if, in, accordance, with, canon, law, however, in, case, of, necessity, baptism, can, be, administered, by, a, deacon, or, in, his, absence, or, if, he, is, impeded, by, another, cleric, a, member, of, an, institute, of, consecrated, life, or, by, any, other, christian, faithful, even, by, the, mother, or, father, if, another, person, is, not, available, who, knows, how, to, baptize, the, discipline, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, oriental, orthodoxy, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, is, similar, to, that, of, the, eastern, catholic, churches, they, require, the, baptizer, even, in, cases, of, necessity, to, be, of, their, own, faith, on, the, grounds, that, a, person, cannot, convey, what, he, himself, does, not, possess, in, this, case, membership, in, the, church, the, latin, catholic, church, does, not, insist, on, this, condition, considering, that, the, effect, of, the, sacrament, such, as, membership, of, the, church, is, not, produced, by, the, person, who, baptizes, but, by, the, holy, spirit, for, the, orthodox, while, baptism, in, extremis, may, be, administered, by, a, deacon, or, any, lay, person, if, the, newly, baptized, person, survives, a, priest, must, still, perform, the, other, prayers, of, the, rite, of, baptism, and, administer, the, mystery, of, chrismation, the, discipline, of, anglicanism, and, lutheranism, is, similar, to, that, of, the, latin, catholic, church, for, methodists, and, many, other, protestant, denominations, the, ordinary, minister, of, baptism, is, an, ordained, or, appointed, minister, newer, movements, of, protestant, evangelical, churches, particularly, non, denominational, allow, laypeople, to, baptize, in, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, only, a, man, who, has, been, ordained, to, the, aaronic, priesthood, holding, the, priesthood, office, of, priest, or, higher, office, in, the, melchizedek, priesthood, may, administer, baptism, a, jehovah, s, witnesses, baptism, is, performed, by, a, dedicated, male, adherent, only, in, extraordinary, circumstances, would, a, dedicated, baptizer, be, unbaptized, see, section, jehovah, s, witnesses, early, anabaptists, were, given, that, name, because, they, re, baptized, persons, who, they, felt, had, not, been, properly, baptized, as, they, did, not, recognize, infant, baptism, the, traditional, form, of, anabaptist, baptism, was, pouring, the, form, commonly, used, in, western, christianity, in, the, early, 16th, century, when, they, emerged, pouring, continues, to, be, normative, in, mennonite, amish, and, hutterite, traditions, of, anabaptist, christianity, the, mennonite, brethren, church, schwarzenau, brethren, and, river, brethren, denominations, of, anabaptist, christianity, practice, immersion, the, schwarzenau, church, immerses, in, the, forward, position, three, times, for, each, person, of, the, holy, trinity, and, because, the, bible, says, jesus, bowed, his, head, letting, it, fall, forward, and, died, baptism, represents, a, dying, of, the, old, sinful, self, today, all, modes, of, baptism, such, as, pouring, and, immersion, can, be, found, among, anabaptists, conservative, mennonite, anabaptists, count, baptism, to, be, one, of, the, seven, ordinances, in, anabaptist, theology, baptism, is, a, part, of, the, process, of, salvation, for, anabaptists, believer, s, baptism, consists, of, three, parts, the, spirit, the, water, and, the, blood, these, three, witnesses, on, earth, according, to, anabaptist, theology, 1, in, believer, s, baptism, the, holy, spirit, witnesses, the, candidate, entering, into, a, covenant, with, god, 2, god, in, believer, s, baptism, grants, a, baptized, believer, the, water, of, baptism, as, a, sign, of, his, covenant, with, them, that, such, a, one, indicates, and, publicly, confesses, that, he, wants, to, live, in, true, obedience, towards, god, and, fellow, believers, with, a, blameless, life, 3, integral, to, believer, s, baptism, is, the, candidate, s, mission, to, witness, to, the, world, even, unto, martyrdom, echoing, jesus, words, that, they, would, be, baptized, with, his, baptism, witnessing, to, the, world, when, their, blood, was, spilt, for, the, majority, of, baptists, christian, baptism, is, the, immersion, of, a, believer, in, water, in, the, name, of, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, baptism, does, not, accomplish, anything, in, itself, but, is, an, outward, personal, sign, that, the, person, s, sins, have, already, been, washed, away, by, the, blood, of, christ, s, cross, for, a, new, convert, the, general, practice, is, that, baptism, also, allows, the, person, to, be, a, registered, member, of, the, local, baptist, congregation, though, some, churches, have, adopted, new, members, classes, as, an, additional, mandatory, step, for, congregational, membership, regarding, rebaptism, the, general, rules, are, for, newborns, there, is, a, ceremony, called, child, dedication, tennessee, antebellum, methodist, circuit, rider, and, newspaper, publisher, william, g, brownlow, stated, within, his, 1856, book, the, great, iron, wheel, examined, or, its, false, spokes, extracted, and, an, exhibition, of, elder, graves, its, builder, that, the, immersion, baptism, practiced, within, the, baptist, churches, as, found, within, the, united, states, did, not, extend, in, a, regular, line, of, succession, from, john, the, baptist, but, from, old, zeke, holliman, and, his, true, yoke, fellow, mr, williams, as, during, 1639, holliman, and, williams, first, immersion, baptized, each, other, and, then, immersion, baptized, the, ten, other, members, of, the, first, baptist, church, in, british, america, at, providence, rhode, island, baptism, in, churches, of, christ, is, performed, only, by, full, bodily, immersion, 107, 124, based, on, the, koine, greek, verb, baptizo, which, means, to, dip, immerse, submerge, or, plunge, 139, 313, 14, 22, 45, 46, submersion, is, seen, as, more, closely, conforming, to, the, death, burial, and, resurrection, of, jesus, than, other, modes, of, baptism, 140, 314, 16, churches, of, christ, argue, that, historically, immersion, was, the, mode, used, in, the, 1st, century, and, that, pouring, and, sprinkling, later, emerged, as, secondary, modes, when, immersion, was, not, possible, 140, over, time, these, secondary, modes, came, to, replace, immersion, 140, only, those, mentally, capable, of, belief, and, repentance, are, baptized, i, e, infant, baptism, is, not, practiced, because, the, new, testament, has, no, precedent, for, it, 124, 318, 19, 195, churches, of, christ, have, historically, had, the, most, conservative, position, on, baptism, among, the, various, branches, of, the, restoration, movement, understanding, baptism, by, immersion, to, be, a, necessary, part, of, conversion, 61, the, most, significant, disagreements, concerned, the, extent, to, which, a, correct, understanding, of, the, role, of, baptism, is, necessary, for, its, validity, p, 61, david, lipscomb, insisted, that, if, a, believer, was, baptized, out, of, a, desire, to, obey, god, the, baptism, was, valid, even, if, the, individual, did, not, fully, understand, the, role, baptism, plays, in, salvation, 61, austin, mcgary, contended, that, to, be, valid, the, convert, must, also, understand, that, baptism, is, for, the, forgiveness, of, sins, 62, mcgary, s, view, became, the, prevailing, one, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, the, approach, advocated, by, lipscomb, never, totally, disappeared, 62, as, such, the, general, practice, among, churches, of, christ, is, to, require, rebaptism, by, immersion, of, converts, even, those, who, were, previously, baptized, by, immersion, in, other, churches, more, recently, the, rise, of, the, international, churches, of, christ, has, caused, some, to, reexamine, the, issue, 66, churches, of, christ, consistently, teach, that, in, baptism, a, believer, surrenders, his, life, in, faith, and, obedience, to, god, and, that, god, by, the, merits, of, christ, s, blood, cleanses, one, from, sin, and, truly, changes, the, state, of, the, person, from, an, alien, to, a, citizen, of, god, s, kingdom, baptism, is, not, a, human, work, it, is, the, place, where, god, does, the, work, that, only, god, can, do, 66, baptism, is, a, passive, act, of, faith, rather, than, a, meritorious, work, it, is, a, confession, that, a, person, has, nothing, to, offer, god, 112, while, churches, of, christ, do, not, describe, baptism, as, a, sacrament, their, view, of, it, can, legitimately, be, described, as, sacramental, 66, 186, they, see, the, power, of, baptism, coming, from, god, who, chose, to, use, baptism, as, a, vehicle, rather, than, from, the, water, or, the, act, itself, 186, and, understand, baptism, to, be, an, integral, part, of, the, conversion, process, rather, than, just, a, symbol, of, conversion, 184, a, recent, trend, is, to, emphasize, the, transformational, aspect, of, baptism, instead, of, describing, it, as, just, a, legal, requirement, or, sign, of, something, that, happened, in, the, past, it, is, seen, as, the, event, that, places, the, believer, into, christ, where, god, does, the, ongoing, work, of, transformation, 66, there, is, a, minority, that, downplays, the, importance, of, baptism, to, avoid, sectarianism, but, the, broader, trend, is, to, reexamine, the, richness, of, the, biblical, teaching, of, baptism, and, to, reinforce, its, central, and, essential, place, in, christianity, 66, because, of, the, belief, that, baptism, is, a, necessary, part, of, salvation, some, baptists, hold, that, the, churches, of, christ, endorse, the, doctrine, of, baptismal, regeneration, however, members, of, the, churches, of, christ, reject, this, arguing, that, since, faith, and, repentance, are, necessary, and, that, the, cleansing, of, sins, is, by, the, blood, of, christ, through, the, grace, of, god, baptism, is, not, an, inherently, redeeming, ritual, 133, 630, 31, rather, their, inclination, is, to, point, to, the, biblical, passage, in, which, peter, analogizing, baptism, to, noah, s, flood, posits, that, likewise, baptism, doth, also, now, save, us, but, parenthetically, clarifies, that, baptism, is, not, the, putting, away, of, the, filth, of, the, flesh, but, the, response, of, a, good, conscience, toward, god, 1, peter, 3, 21, one, author, from, the, churches, of, christ, describes, the, relationship, between, faith, and, baptism, this, way, faith, is, the, reason, why, a, person, is, a, child, of, god, baptism, is, the, time, at, which, one, is, incorporated, into, christ, and, so, becomes, a, child, of, god, italics, are, in, the, source, 170, baptism, is, understood, as, a, confessional, expression, of, faith, and, repentance, 179, 82, rather, than, a, work, that, earns, salvation, 170, in, lutheran, christianity, baptism, is, a, sacrament, that, regenerates, the, soul, upon, one, s, baptism, one, receives, the, holy, spirit, and, becomes, a, part, of, the, church, according, to, martin, luther, s, small, catechism, it, is, the, word, and, command, of, god, in, and, with, the, water, that, gives, baptism, its, power, which, works, forgiveness, of, sins, delivers, from, death, and, the, devil, and, gives, eternal, salvation, to, all, who, believe, this, as, the, words, and, promises, of, god, declare, in, lutheran, theology, baptism, is, not, viewed, as, a, work, that, the, baptizer, performs, in, obedience, to, the, law, but, rather, a, work, of, god, that, is, received, by, faith, which, clings, to, the, water, the, methodist, articles, of, religion, with, regard, to, baptism, teach, baptism, is, not, only, a, sign, of, profession, and, mark, of, difference, whereby, christians, are, distinguished, from, others, that, are, not, baptized, but, it, is, also, a, sign, of, regeneration, or, the, new, birth, the, baptism, of, young, children, is, to, be, retained, in, the, church, while, baptism, imparts, grace, methodists, teach, that, a, personal, acceptance, of, jesus, christ, the, first, work, of, grace, is, essential, to, one, s, salvation, during, the, second, work, of, grace, entire, sanctification, a, believer, is, purified, of, original, sin, and, made, holy, as, such, in, the, methodist, tradition, baptism, with, the, holy, spirit, has, referred, to, the, second, work, of, grace, entire, sanctification, christian, perfection, in, the, methodist, churches, baptism, is, a, sacrament, of, initiation, into, the, visible, church, wesleyan, covenant, theology, further, teaches, that, baptism, is, a, sign, and, a, seal, of, the, covenant, of, grace, of, this, great, new, covenant, blessing, baptism, was, therefore, eminently, the, sign, and, it, represented, the, pouring, out, of, the, spirit, the, descending, of, the, spirit, the, falling, of, the, spirit, upon, men, by, the, mode, in, which, it, was, administered, the, pouring, of, water, from, above, upon, the, subjects, baptized, as, a, seal, also, or, confirming, sign, baptism, answers, to, circumcision, methodists, recognize, three, modes, of, baptism, as, being, valid, immersion, sprinkling, or, pouring, in, the, name, of, the, holy, trinity, the, moravian, church, teaches, that, baptism, is, a, sign, and, a, seal, recognizing, three, modes, of, baptism, as, being, valid, immersion, aspersion, and, affusion, in, reformed, baptismal, theology, baptism, is, seen, as, primarily, god, s, offer, of, union, with, christ, and, all, his, benefits, to, the, baptized, this, offer, is, believed, to, be, intact, even, when, it, is, not, received, in, faith, by, the, person, baptized, reformed, theologians, believe, the, holy, spirit, brings, into, effect, the, promises, signified, in, baptism, baptism, is, held, by, almost, the, entire, reformed, tradition, to, effect, regeneration, even, in, infants, who, are, incapable, of, faith, by, effecting, faith, which, would, come, to, fruition, later, baptism, also, initiates, one, into, the, visible, church, and, the, covenant, of, grace, baptism, is, seen, as, a, replacement, of, circumcision, which, is, considered, the, rite, of, initiation, into, the, covenant, of, grace, in, the, old, testament, reformed, christians, believe, that, immersion, is, not, necessary, for, baptism, to, be, properly, performed, but, that, pouring, or, sprinkling, are, acceptable, only, ordained, ministers, are, permitted, to, administer, baptism, in, reformed, churches, with, no, allowance, for, emergency, baptism, though, baptisms, performed, by, non, ministers, are, generally, considered, valid, reformed, churches, while, rejecting, the, baptismal, ceremonies, of, the, roman, catholic, church, accept, the, validity, of, baptisms, performed, with, them, and, do, not, rebaptize, in, united, protestant, churches, such, as, the, united, church, of, canada, church, of, north, india, church, of, pakistan, church, of, south, india, protestant, church, in, the, netherlands, uniting, church, in, australia, and, united, church, of, christ, in, japan, baptism, is, a, sacrament, in, catholic, teaching, baptism, is, stated, to, be, necessary, for, salvation, by, actual, reception, or, at, least, by, desire, catholic, discipline, requires, the, baptism, ceremony, to, be, performed, by, deacons, priests, or, bishops, but, in, an, emergency, such, as, danger, of, death, anyone, can, licitly, baptize, this, teaching, is, based, on, the, gospel, according, to, john, which, says, that, jesus, proclaimed, truly, truly, i, say, to, you, unless, one, is, born, of, water, and, the, spirit, he, cannot, enter, into, the, kingdom, of, god, it, dates, back, to, the, teachings, and, practices, of, 1st, century, christians, and, the, connection, between, salvation, and, baptism, was, not, on, the, whole, an, item, of, major, dispute, until, huldrych, zwingli, denied, the, necessity, of, baptism, which, he, saw, as, merely, a, sign, granting, admission, to, the, christian, community, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, that, baptism, is, necessary, for, salvation, for, those, to, whom, the, gospel, has, been, proclaimed, and, who, have, had, the, possibility, of, asking, for, this, sacrament, the, council, of, trent, also, states, in, the, decree, concerning, justification, from, session, six, that, baptism, is, necessary, for, salvation, a, person, who, knowingly, willfully, and, unrepentantly, rejects, baptism, has, no, hope, of, salvation, however, if, knowledge, is, absent, those, also, can, attain, to, salvation, who, through, no, fault, of, their, own, do, not, know, the, gospel, of, christ, or, his, church, yet, sincerely, seek, god, and, moved, by, grace, strive, by, their, deeds, to, do, his, will, as, it, is, known, to, them, through, the, dictates, of, conscience, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, also, states, since, baptism, signifies, liberation, from, sin, and, from, its, instigator, the, devil, one, or, more, exorcisms, are, pronounced, over, the, candidate, in, the, roman, rite, of, the, baptism, of, a, child, the, wording, of, the, prayer, of, exorcism, is, almighty, and, ever, living, god, you, sent, your, only, son, into, the, world, to, cast, out, the, power, of, satan, spirit, of, evil, to, rescue, man, from, the, kingdom, of, darkness, and, bring, him, into, the, splendour, of, your, kingdom, of, light, we, pray, for, this, child, set, him, her, free, from, original, sin, make, him, her, a, temple, of, your, glory, and, send, your, holy, spirit, to, dwell, with, him, her, through, christ, our, lord, in, the, catholic, church, by, baptism, all, sins, are, forgiven, original, sin, and, all, personal, sins, baptism, not, only, purifies, from, all, sins, but, also, makes, the, neophyte, a, new, creature, an, adopted, son, of, god, who, has, become, a, partaker, of, the, divine, nature, member, of, christ, and, co, heir, with, him, and, a, temple, of, the, holy, spirit, given, once, for, all, baptism, cannot, be, repeated, just, as, a, man, can, be, born, only, once, so, he, is, baptized, only, once, for, this, reason, the, holy, fathers, added, to, the, nicene, creed, the, words, we, acknowledge, one, baptism, sanctifying, grace, the, grace, of, justification, given, by, god, by, baptism, erases, the, original, sin, and, personal, actual, sins, the, power, of, baptism, consists, in, cleansing, a, man, from, all, his, sins, as, regards, both, guild, and, punishment, for, which, reason, no, penance, is, imposed, on, those, who, receive, baptism, no, matter, how, great, their, sins, may, have, been, and, if, they, were, to, die, immediately, after, baptism, they, would, rise, at, once, to, eternal, life, in, the, latin, church, of, the, catholic, church, a, valid, baptism, requires, according, to, canon, 758, of, the, 1917, code, of, canon, law, the, baptizer, to, pronounce, the, formula, i, baptize, you, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, while, putting, the, baptized, in, contact, with, water, the, contact, may, be, immersion, affusion, pouring, or, aspersion, sprinkling, the, formula, requires, name, to, be, singular, emphasising, the, monotheism, of, the, trinity, it, is, claimed, that, pope, stephen, i, ambrose, and, pope, nicholas, i, declared, that, baptisms, in, the, name, of, jesus, only, as, well, as, in, the, name, of, father, son, and, holy, spirit, were, valid, the, correct, interpretation, of, their, words, is, disputed, current, canonical, law, requires, the, trinitarian, formula, and, water, for, validity, the, formula, requires, i, baptize, rather, than, we, baptize, as, clarified, by, a, responsum, of, june, 24, 2020, in, 2022, the, diocese, of, phoenix, accepted, the, resignation, of, a, parish, priest, whose, use, of, we, baptize, had, invalidated, thousands, of, baptisms, over, more, than, 20, years, note, that, in, the, byzantine, rite, the, formla, is, in, the, passive, voice, the, servant, of, god, n, is, baptized, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, offspring, of, practicing, catholic, parents, are, typically, baptized, as, infants, baptism, is, part, of, the, rite, of, christian, initiation, of, adults, provided, for, converts, from, non, christian, backgrounds, and, others, not, baptized, as, infants, baptism, by, non, catholic, christians, is, valid, if, the, formula, and, water, are, present, and, so, converts, from, other, christian, denominations, are, not, given, a, catholic, baptism, the, church, recognizes, two, equivalents, of, baptism, with, water, baptism, of, blood, and, baptism, of, desire, baptism, of, blood, is, that, undergone, by, unbaptized, individuals, who, are, martyred, for, their, faith, while, baptism, of, desire, generally, applies, to, catechumens, who, die, before, they, can, be, baptized, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, describes, these, two, forms, the, church, has, always, held, the, firm, conviction, that, those, who, suffer, death, for, the, sake, of, the, faith, without, having, received, baptism, are, baptized, by, their, death, for, and, with, christ, this, baptism, of, blood, like, the, desire, for, baptism, brings, about, the, fruits, of, baptism, without, being, a, sacrament, for, catechumens, who, die, before, their, baptism, their, explicit, desire, to, receive, it, together, with, repentance, for, their, sins, and, charity, assures, them, the, salvation, that, they, were, not, able, to, receive, through, the, sacrament, the, catholic, church, holds, that, those, who, are, ignorant, of, christ, s, gospel, and, of, the, church, but, who, seek, the, truth, and, do, god, s, will, as, they, understand, it, may, be, supposed, to, have, an, implicit, desire, for, baptism, and, can, be, saved, since, christ, died, for, all, and, since, all, men, are, in, fact, called, to, one, and, the, same, destiny, which, is, divine, we, must, hold, that, the, holy, spirit, offers, to, all, the, possibility, of, being, made, partakers, in, a, way, known, to, god, of, the, paschal, mystery, every, man, who, is, ignorant, of, the, gospel, of, christ, and, of, his, church, but, seeks, the, truth, and, does, the, will, of, god, in, accordance, with, his, understanding, of, it, can, be, saved, it, may, be, supposed, that, such, persons, would, have, desired, baptism, explicitly, if, they, had, known, its, necessity, as, for, unbaptized, infants, the, church, is, unsure, of, their, fate, the, church, can, only, entrust, them, to, the, mercy, of, god, in, eastern, orthodoxy, baptism, is, considered, a, sacrament, and, mystery, which, transforms, the, old, and, sinful, person, into, a, new, and, pure, one, where, the, old, life, the, sins, any, mistakes, made, are, gone, and, a, clean, slate, is, given, in, greek, and, russian, orthodox, traditions, it, is, taught, that, through, baptism, a, person, is, united, to, the, body, of, christ, by, becoming, an, official, member, of, the, orthodox, church, during, the, service, the, orthodox, priest, blesses, the, water, to, be, used, the, catechumen, the, one, baptised, is, fully, immersed, in, the, water, three, times, in, the, name, of, the, trinity, this, is, considered, to, be, a, death, of, the, old, man, by, participation, in, the, crucifixion, and, burial, of, christ, and, a, rebirth, into, new, life, in, christ, by, participation, in, his, resurrection, 277, 278, properly, a, new, name, is, given, which, becomes, the, person, s, name, babies, of, orthodox, families, are, normally, baptized, shortly, after, birth, older, converts, to, orthodoxy, are, usually, formally, baptized, into, the, orthodox, church, though, exceptions, are, sometimes, made, those, who, choose, to, convert, from, a, different, religion, to, eastern, orthodoxy, typically, undergo, chrismation, known, as, confirmation, in, the, roman, catholic, church, properly, and, generally, the, mystery, of, baptism, is, administered, by, bishops, and, other, priests, however, in, emergencies, any, orthodox, christian, can, baptize, 278, in, such, cases, should, the, person, survive, the, emergency, it, is, likely, that, the, person, will, be, properly, baptized, by, a, priest, at, some, later, date, this, is, not, considered, to, be, a, second, baptism, nor, is, it, imagined, that, the, person, is, not, already, orthodox, but, rather, it, is, a, fulfillment, of, the, proper, form, the, service, of, baptism, in, greek, orthodox, and, other, eastern, orthodox, churches, has, remained, largely, unchanged, for, over, 1500, years, this, fact, is, witnessed, to, by, cyril, of, jerusalem, d, 386, who, in, his, discourse, on, the, sacrament, of, baptism, describes, the, service, in, much, the, same, way, as, is, currently, in, use, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, baptism, should, be, performed, by, complete, immersion, submersion, in, water, and, only, when, an, individual, is, old, enough, to, understand, its, significance, they, believe, that, water, baptism, is, an, outward, symbol, that, a, person, has, made, an, unconditional, dedication, through, jesus, christ, to, do, the, will, of, god, only, after, baptism, is, a, person, considered, a, full, fledged, witness, and, an, official, member, of, the, christian, congregation, they, consider, baptism, to, constitute, ordination, as, a, minister, prospective, candidates, for, baptism, must, express, their, desire, to, be, baptized, well, in, advance, of, a, planned, baptismal, event, to, allow, for, congregation, elders, to, assess, their, suitability, regarding, true, repentance, and, conversion, elders, approve, candidates, for, baptism, if, the, candidates, are, considered, to, understand, what, is, expected, of, members, of, the, religion, and, to, demonstrate, sincere, dedication, to, the, faith, most, baptisms, among, jehovah, s, witnesses, are, performed, at, scheduled, assemblies, and, conventions, by, elders, and, ministerial, servants, in, special, pools, or, sometimes, oceans, rivers, or, lakes, depending, on, circumstances, and, rarely, occur, at, local, kingdom, halls, prior, to, baptism, at, the, conclusion, of, a, pre, baptism, talk, candidates, must, affirm, two, questions, only, baptized, males, elders, or, ministerial, servants, may, baptize, new, members, baptizers, and, candidates, wear, swimsuits, or, other, informal, clothing, for, baptism, but, are, directed, to, avoid, clothing, that, is, considered, undignified, or, too, revealing, generally, candidates, are, individually, immersed, by, a, single, baptizer, unless, a, candidate, has, special, circumstances, such, as, a, physical, disability, in, circumstances, of, extended, isolation, a, qualified, candidate, s, dedication, and, stated, intention, to, become, baptized, may, serve, to, identify, him, as, a, member, of, jehovah, s, witnesses, even, if, immersion, itself, must, be, delayed, in, rare, instances, unbaptized, males, who, had, stated, such, an, intention, have, reciprocally, baptized, each, other, with, both, baptisms, accepted, as, valid, individuals, who, had, been, baptized, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, by, female, witnesses, due, to, extenuating, circumstances, such, as, in, concentration, camps, were, later, re, baptized, but, still, recognized, their, original, baptism, dates, in, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, baptism, is, recognized, as, the, first, of, several, ordinances, rituals, of, the, gospel, in, mormonism, baptism, has, the, main, purpose, of, remitting, the, sins, of, the, participant, it, is, followed, by, confirmation, which, inducts, the, person, into, membership, in, the, church, and, constitutes, a, baptism, with, the, holy, spirit, latter, day, saints, believe, that, baptism, must, be, by, full, immersion, and, by, a, precise, ritualized, ordinance, if, some, part, of, the, participant, is, not, fully, immersed, or, the, ordinance, was, not, recited, verbatim, the, ritual, must, be, repeated, it, typically, occurs, in, a, baptismal, font, in, addition, members, of, the, lds, church, do, not, believe, a, baptism, is, valid, unless, it, is, performed, by, a, latter, day, saint, one, who, has, proper, authority, a, priest, or, elder, authority, is, passed, down, through, a, form, of, apostolic, succession, all, new, converts, to, the, faith, must, be, baptized, or, re, baptized, baptism, is, seen, as, symbolic, both, of, jesus, death, burial, and, resurrection, and, is, also, symbolic, of, the, baptized, individual, discarding, their, natural, self, and, donning, a, new, identity, as, a, disciple, of, jesus, according, to, latter, day, saint, theology, faith, and, repentance, are, prerequisites, to, baptism, the, ritual, does, not, cleanse, the, participant, of, original, sin, as, latter, day, saints, do, not, believe, the, doctrine, of, original, sin, mormonism, rejects, infant, baptism, and, baptism, must, occur, after, the, age, of, accountability, defined, in, latter, day, saint, scripture, as, eight, years, old, latter, day, saint, theology, also, teaches, baptism, for, the, dead, in, which, deceased, ancestors, are, baptized, vicariously, by, the, living, and, believe, that, their, practice, is, what, paul, wrote, of, in, corinthians, 15, 29, this, occurs, in, latter, day, saint, temples, due, to, tensions, between, the, roman, catholic, church, and, freemasons, in, france, in, the, aftermath, of, the, french, revolution, french, freemasons, developed, rituals, to, replace, those, of, the, church, including, baptism, chr, tien, guillaume, riebesthal, s, rituel, ma, onnique, pour, tous, les, rites, masonic, ritual, for, all, rites, published, in, strasbourg, in, 1826, includes, one, such, baptismal, rite, lodges, in, louisiana, and, wisconsin, performed, baptism, ceremonies, in, 1859, though, they, were, widely, condemned, by, their, grand, lodges, in, 1865, albert, pike, publicly, performed, a, ceremony, of, masonic, baptism, in, new, york, city, the, ceremony, was, greeted, with, skepticism, by, many, american, masons, including, albert, mackey, a, ceremony, for, masonic, baptism, was, published, by, charles, t, mcclenechan, in, 1884, quakers, members, of, the, religious, society, of, friends, do, not, believe, in, the, baptism, of, either, children, or, adults, with, water, rejecting, all, forms, of, outward, sacraments, in, their, religious, life, robert, barclay, s, apology, for, the, true, christian, divinity, a, historic, explanation, of, quaker, theology, from, the, 17th, century, explains, quakers, opposition, to, baptism, with, water, thus, i, indeed, baptize, you, with, water, unto, repentance, but, he, that, cometh, after, me, is, mightier, than, i, whose, shoes, i, am, not, worthy, to, bear, he, shall, baptize, you, with, the, holy, ghost, and, with, fire, here, john, mentions, two, manners, of, baptizings, and, two, different, baptisms, the, one, with, water, and, the, other, with, the, spirit, the, one, whereof, he, was, the, minister, of, the, other, whereof, christ, was, the, minister, of, and, such, as, were, baptized, with, the, first, were, not, therefore, baptized, with, the, second, i, indeed, baptize, you, but, he, shall, baptize, you, though, in, the, present, time, they, were, baptized, with, the, baptism, of, water, yet, they, were, not, as, yet, but, were, to, be, baptized, with, the, baptism, of, christ, barclay, argued, that, water, baptism, was, only, something, that, happened, until, the, time, of, christ, but, that, now, people, are, baptised, inwardly, by, the, spirit, of, christ, and, hence, there, is, no, need, for, the, external, sacrament, of, water, baptism, which, quakers, argue, is, meaningless, the, salvation, army, does, not, practice, water, baptism, or, indeed, other, outward, sacraments, william, booth, and, catherine, booth, the, founders, of, the, salvation, army, believed, that, many, christians, had, come, to, rely, on, the, outward, signs, of, spiritual, grace, rather, than, on, grace, itself, they, believed, what, was, important, was, spiritual, grace, itself, however, although, the, salvation, army, does, not, practice, baptism, they, are, not, opposed, to, baptism, within, other, christian, denominations, there, are, some, christians, termed, hyperdispensationalists, mid, acts, dispensationalism, who, accept, only, paul, s, epistles, as, directly, applicable, for, the, church, today, they, do, not, accept, water, baptism, as, a, practice, for, the, church, since, paul, who, was, god, s, apostle, to, the, nations, was, not, sent, to, baptize, ultradispensationalists, acts, 28, dispensationalism, who, do, not, accept, the, practice, of, the, lord, s, supper, do, not, practice, baptism, because, these, are, not,

the, same, as, paul, s, hyperdispensationalists, assert, water, baptism, found, early, in, the, book, of, acts, is, according, to, this, view, now, supplanted, by, the, one, baptism, foretold, by, john, the, baptist, others, make, a, distinction, between, john, s, prophesied, baptism, by, christ, with, the, holy, spirit, and, the, holy, spirit, s, baptism, of, the, believer, into, the, body, of, christ, the, latter, being, the, one, baptism, for, today, the, one, baptism, for, today, it, is, asserted, is, the, baptism, of, the, holy, spirit, of, the, believer, into, the, body, of, christ, church, many, in, this, group, also, argue, that, john, s, promised, baptism, by, fire, is, pending, referring, to, the, destruction, of, the, world, by, fire, other, hyperdispensationalists, believe, that, baptism, was, necessary, until, mid, acts, most, christian, churches, see, baptism, as, a, once, in, a, lifetime, event, that, can, be, neither, repeated, nor, undone, they, hold, that, those, who, have, been, baptized, remain, baptized, even, if, they, renounce, the, christian, faith, by, adopting, a, non, christian, religion, or, by, rejecting, religion, entirely, but, some, other, organizations, and, individuals, are, practicing, debaptism, a, comparative, summary, of, the, practice, of, baptism, throughout, various, christian, denominations, is, given, below, this, section,

given, to, the, blessing, of, musical, especially, church, bells, at, least, in, france, since, the, 11th, century, it, is, derived, from, the, washing, of, the, bell, with, holy, water, by, the, bishop, before, he, anoints, it, with, the, oil, of, the, infirm, without, and, with, chrism, within, a, fuming, censer, is, placed, under, it, and, the, bishop, prays, that, these, sacramentals, of, the, church, may, at, the, sound, of, the, bell, put, the, demons, to, flight, protect, from, storms, and, call, the, faithful, to, prayer, baptism, of, dolls, the, custom, of, dolly, dunking, was, once, a, common, practice, in, parts, of, the, united, kingdom, particularly, in, cornwall, where, it, has, been, revived, in, recent, years, many, cultures, practice, or, have, practiced, initiation, rites, with, or, without, the, use, of, water, including, the, ancient, egyptian, the, hebraic, jewish, the, babylonian, the, mayan, and, the, norse, cultures, the, modern, japanese, practice, of, miyamairi, is, such, a, ceremony, that, does, not, use, water, in, some, such, evidence, may, be, archaeological, and, descriptive, in, nature, rather, than, a, modern, practice, many, scholars, have, drawn, parallels, between, rites, from, mystery, religions, and, baptism, in, christianity, apuleius, a, 2nd, century, roman, writer, described, an, initiation, into, the, mysteries, of, isis, the, initiation, was, preceded, by, a, normal, bathing, in, the, public, baths, and, a, ceremonial, sprinkling, by, the, priest, of, isis, after, which, the, candidate, was, given, secret, instructions, in, the, temple, of, the, goddess, the, candidate, then, fasted, for, ten, days, from, meat, and, wine, after, which, he, was, dressed, in, linen, and, led, at, night, into, the, innermost, part, of, the, sanctuary, where, the, actual, initiation, took, place, the, details, of, which, were, secret, on, the, next, two, days, dressed, in, the, robes, of, his, consecration, he, participated, in, feasting, apuleius, describes, also, an, initiation, into, the, cult, of, osiris, and, yet, a, third, initiation, of, the, same, pattern, as, the, initiation, into, the, cult, of, isis, without, mention, of, a, preliminary, bathing, the, water, less, initiations, of, lucius, the, character, in, apuleius, s, story, who, had, been, turned, into, an, ass, and, changed, back, by, isis, into, human, form, into, the, successive, degrees, of, the, rites, of, the, goddess, was, accomplished, only, after, a, significant, period, of, study, to, demonstrate, his, loyalty, and, trustworthiness, akin, to, catechumenal, practices, preceding, baptism, in, christianity, jan, bremmer, has, written, on, the, putative, connection, between, rites, from, mystery, religions, and, baptism, there, are, thus, some, verbal, parallels, between, early, christianity, and, the, mysteries, but, the, situation, is, rather, different, as, regards, early, christian, ritual, practice, much, ink, was, spilled, around, 1900, arguing, that, the, rituals, of, baptism, and, of, the, last, supper, derived, from, the, ancient, mysteries, but, nock, and, others, after, him, have, easily, shown, that, these, attempts, grossly, misinterpreted, the, sources, baptism, is, clearly, rooted, in, jewish, purificatory, rituals, and, cult, meals, are, so, widespread, in, antiquity, that, any, specific, derivation, is, arbitrary, it, is, truly, surprising, to, see, how, long, the, attempts, to, find, some, pagan, background, to, these, two, christian, sacraments, have, persevered, secularising, ideologies, clearly, played, an, important, part, in, these, interpretations, but, nevertheless, they, have, helped, to, clarify, the, relations, between, nascent, christianity, and, its, surroundings, thus, the, practice, is, derivative, whether, from, judaism, the, mysteries, or, a, combination, see, the, reference, to, hellenistic, judaism, in, the, etymology, section, the, ecclesia, gnostica, catholica,
