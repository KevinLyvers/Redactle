refers, to, the, teachings, of, the, buddha, in, buddhist, philosophy, dhamma, dharma, is, also, the, term, for, phenomena, dharma, in, jainism, refers, to, the, teachings, of, tirthankara, jina, and, the, body, of, doctrine, pertaining, to, the, purification, and, moral, transformation, of, humans, in, sikhism, dharma, indicates, the, path, of, righteousness, proper, religious, practices, and, performing, one, s, own, moral, duties, as, with, the, other, components, of, the, puru, rtha, the, concept, of, dharma, is, pan, indian, the, ancient, tamil, text, tirukku, a, despite, being, a, collection, of, aphoristic, teachings, on, dharma, aram, artha, porul, and, kama, inpam, is, completely, and, exclusively, based, on, a, am, the, tamil, term, for, dharma, the, word, dharma, d, r, m, has, roots, in, the, sanskrit, dhr, which, means, to, hold, or, to, support, and, is, related, to, latin, firmus, firm, stable, from, this, it, takes, the, meaning, of, what, is, established, or, firm, and, hence, law, it, is, derived, from, an, older, vedic, sanskrit, n, stem, dharman, with, a, literal, meaning, of, bearer, supporter, in, a, religious, sense, conceived, as, an, aspect, of, rta, in, the, rigveda, the, word, appears, as, an, n, stem, dh, rman, with, a, range, of, meanings, encompassing, something, established, or, firm, in, the, literal, sense, of, prods, or, poles, figuratively, it, means, sustainer, and, supporter, of, deities, it, is, semantically, similar, to, the, greek, themis, fixed, decree, statute, law, in, classical, sanskrit, and, in, the, vedic, sanskrit, of, the, atharvaveda, the, stem, is, thematic, dh, rma, devanagari, in, prakrit, and, pali, it, is, rendered, dhamma, in, some, contemporary, indian, languages, and, dialects, it, alternatively, occurs, as, dharm, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, translated, dharma, into, greek, and, aramaic, and, he, used, the, greek, word, eusebeia, piety, spiritual, maturity, or, godliness, in, the, kandahar, bilingual, rock, inscription, and, the, kandahar, greek, edicts, in, the, kandahar, bilingual, rock, inscription, he, used, the, aramaic, word, q, y, truth, rectitude, dharma, is, a, concept, of, central, importance, in, indian, philosophy, and, indian, religions, it, has, multiple, meanings, in, hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, and, jainism, it, is, difficult, to, provide, a, single, concise, definition, for, dharma, as, the, word, has, a, long, and, varied, history, and, straddles, a, complex, set, of, meanings, and, interpretations, there, is, no, equivalent, single, word, synonym, for, dharma, in, western, languages, there, have, been, numerous, conflicting, attempts, to, translate, ancient, sanskrit, literature, with, the, word, dharma, into, german, english, and, french, the, concept, claims, paul, horsch, has, caused, exceptional, difficulties, for, modern, commentators, and, translators, for, example, while, grassmann, s, translation, of, rig, veda, identifies, seven, different, meanings, of, dharma, karl, friedrich, geldner, in, his, translation, of, the, rig, veda, employs, 20, different, translations, for, dharma, including, meanings, such, as, law, order, duty, custom, quality, and, model, among, others, however, the, word, dharma, has, become, a, widely, accepted, loanword, in, english, and, is, included, in, all, modern, unabridged, english, dictionaries, the, root, of, the, word, dharma, is, dhr, which, means, to, support, hold, or, bear, it, is, the, thing, that, regulates, the, course, of, change, by, not, participating, in, change, but, that, principle, which, remains, constant, monier, williams, sanskrit, english, dictionary, the, widely, cited, resource, for, definitions, and, explanation, of, sanskrit, words, and, concepts, of, hinduism, offers, numerous, definitions, of, the, word, dharma, such, as, that, which, is, established, or, firm, steadfast, decree, statute, law, practice, custom, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality, ethics, religion, religious, merit, good, works, nature, character, quality, property, yet, each, of, these, definitions, is, incomplete, while, the, combination, of, these, translations, does, not, convey, the, total, sense, of, the, word, in, common, parlance, dharma, means, right, way, of, living, and, path, of, rightness, dharma, also, has, connotations, of, order, and, when, combined, with, the, word, sanatana, it, can, also, be, described, as, eternal, truth, the, meaning, of, the, word, dharma, depends, on, the, context, and, its, meaning, has, evolved, as, ideas, of, hinduism, have, developed, through, history, in, the, earliest, texts, and, ancient, myths, of, hinduism, dharma, meant, cosmic, law, the, rules, that, created, the, universe, from, chaos, as, well, as, rituals, in, later, vedas, upanishads, puranas, and, the, epics, the, meaning, became, refined, richer, and, more, complex, and, the, word, was, applied, to, diverse, contexts, in, certain, contexts, dharma, designates, human, behaviours, considered, necessary, for, order, of, things, in, the, universe, principles, that, prevent, chaos, behaviours, and, action, necessary, to, all, life, in, nature, society, family, as, well, as, at, the, individual, level, dharma, encompasses, ideas, such, as, duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs, and, all, behaviour, considered, appropriate, correct, or, morally, upright, for, further, context, the, word, varnasramdharma, is, often, used, in, its, place, defined, as, dharma, specifically, related, to, the, stage, of, life, one, is, in, the, concept, of, dharma, is, believed, to, have, a, transtemporal, validity, the, antonym, of, dharma, is, adharma, sanskrit, meaning, that, which, is, not, dharma, as, with, dharma, the, word, adharma, includes, and, implies, many, ideas, in, common, parlance, adharma, means, that, which, is, against, nature, immoral, unethical, wrong, or, unlawful, in, buddhism, dharma, incorporates, the, teachings, and, doctrines, of, the, founder, of, buddhism, the, buddha, according, to, pandurang, vaman, kane, author, of, history, of, dharma, stra, the, word, dharma, appears, at, least, fifty, six, times, in, the, hymns, of, the, rigveda, as, an, adjective, or, noun, according, to, paul, horsch, the, word, dharma, has, its, origin, in, vedic, hinduism, the, hymns, of, the, rigveda, claim, brahman, created, the, universe, from, chaos, they, hold, dhar, the, earth, and, sun, and, stars, apart, they, support, dhar, the, sky, away, and, distinct, from, earth, and, they, stabilise, dhar, the, quaking, mountains, and, plains, the, deities, mainly, indra, then, deliver, and, hold, order, from, disorder, harmony, from, chaos, stability, from, instability, actions, recited, in, the, veda, with, the, root, of, word, dharma, in, hymns, composed, after, the, mythological, verses, the, word, dharma, takes, expanded, meaning, as, a, cosmic, principle, and, appears, in, verses, independent, of, deities, it, evolves, into, a, concept, claims, paul, horsch, that, has, a, dynamic, functional, sense, in, atharvaveda, for, example, where, it, becomes, the, cosmic, law, that, links, cause, and, effect, through, a, subject, dharma, in, these, ancient, texts, also, takes, a, ritual, meaning, the, ritual, is, connected, to, the, cosmic, and, dharmani, is, equated, to, ceremonial, devotion, to, the, principles, that, deities, used, to, create, order, from, disorder, the, world, from, chaos, past, the, ritual, and, cosmic, sense, of, dharma, that, link, the, current, world, to, mythical, universe, the, concept, extends, to, an, ethical, social, sense, that, links, human, beings, to, each, other, and, to, other, life, forms, it, is, here, that, dharma, as, a, concept, of, law, emerges, in, hinduism, dharma, and, related, words, are, found, in, the, oldest, vedic, literature, of, hinduism, in, later, vedas, upanishads, puranas, and, the, epics, the, word, dharma, also, plays, a, central, role, in, the, literature, of, other, indian, religions, founded, later, such, as, buddhism, and, jainism, according, to, brereton, dharman, occurs, 63, times, in, rig, veda, in, addition, words, related, to, dharman, also, appear, in, rig, veda, for, example, once, as, dharmakrt, 6, times, as, satyadharman, and, once, as, dharmavant, 4, times, as, dharman, and, twice, as, dhariman, indo, european, parallels, for, dharma, are, known, but, the, only, iranian, equivalent, is, old, persian, darm, n, meaning, remedy, this, meaning, is, different, from, the, indo, aryan, dh, rman, suggesting, that, the, word, dharma, did, not, play, a, major, role, in, the, indo, iranian, period, instead, it, was, primarily, developed, more, recently, under, the, vedic, tradition, it, is, thought, that, the, daena, of, zoroastrianism, also, meaning, the, eternal, law, or, religion, is, related, to, sanskrit, dharma, ideas, in, parts, overlapping, to, dharma, are, found, in, other, ancient, cultures, such, as, chinese, tao, egyptian, maat, sumerian, me, in, the, mid, 20th, century, an, inscription, of, the, indian, emperor, asoka, from, the, year, 258, bce, was, discovered, in, afghanistan, the, kandahar, bilingual, rock, inscription, this, rock, inscription, contains, greek, and, aramaic, text, according, to, paul, hacker, on, the, rock, appears, a, greek, rendering, for, the, sanskrit, word, dharma, the, word, eusebeia, scholars, of, hellenistic, greece, explain, eusebeia, as, a, complex, concept, eusebia, means, not, only, to, venerate, deities, but, also, spiritual, maturity, a, reverential, attitude, toward, life, and, includes, the, right, conduct, toward, one, s, parents, siblings, and, children, the, right, conduct, between, husband, and, wife, and, the, conduct, between, biologically, unrelated, people, this, rock, inscription, concludes, paul, hacker, suggests, dharma, in, india, about, 2300, years, ago, was, a, central, concept, and, meant, not, only, religious, ideas, but, ideas, of, right, of, good, of, one, s, duty, toward, the, human, community, the, evolving, literature, of, hinduism, linked, dharma, to, two, other, important, concepts, ta, and, m, y, ta, in, vedas, is, the, truth, and, cosmic, principle, which, regulates, and, coordinates, the, operation, of, the, universe, and, everything, within, it, m, y, in, rig, veda, and, later, literature, means, illusion, fraud, deception, magic, that, misleads, and, creates, disorder, thus, is, contrary, to, reality, laws, and, rules, that, establish, order, predictability, and, harmony, paul, horsch, suggests, ta, and, dharma, are, parallel, concepts, the, former, being, a, cosmic, principle, the, latter, being, of, moral, social, sphere, while, m, y, and, dharma, are, also, correlative, concepts, the, former, being, that, which, corrupts, law, and, moral, life, the, later, being, that, which, strengthens, law, and, moral, life, day, proposes, dharma, is, a, manifestation, of, ta, but, suggests, ta, may, have, been, subsumed, into, a, more, complex, concept, of, dharma, as, the, idea, developed, in, ancient, india, over, time, in, a, nonlinear, manner, the, following, verse, from, the, rigveda, is, an, example, where, rta, and, dharma, are, linked, o, indra, lead, us, on, the, path, of, rta, on, the, right, path, over, all, evils, traditional, dharma, is, an, organising, principle, in, hinduism, that, applies, to, human, beings, in, solitude, in, their, interaction, with, human, beings, and, nature, as, well, as, between, inanimate, objects, to, all, of, cosmos, and, its, parts, it, refers, to, the, order, and, customs, which, make, life, and, universe, possible, and, includes, behaviours, rituals, rules, that, govern, society, and, ethics, hindu, dharma, includes, the, religious, duties, moral, rights, and, duties, of, each, individual, as, well, as, behaviours, that, enable, social, order, right, conduct, and, those, that, are, virtuous, dharma, according, to, van, buitenen, is, that, which, all, existing, beings, must, accept, and, respect, to, sustain, harmony, and, order, in, the, world, it, is, neither, the, act, nor, the, result, but, the, natural, laws, that, guide, the, act, and, create, the, result, to, prevent, chaos, in, the, world, it, is, innate, characteristic, that, makes, the, being, what, it, is, it, is, claims, van, buitenen, the, pursuit, and, execution, of, one, s, nature, and, true, calling, thus, playing, one, s, role, in, cosmic, concert, in, hinduism, it, is, the, dharma, of, the, bee, to, make, honey, of, cow, to, give, milk, of, sun, to, radiate, sunshine, of, river, to, flow, in, terms, of, humanity, dharma, is, the, need, for, the, effect, of, and, essence, of, service, and, interconnectedness, of, all, life, this, includes, duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues, and, right, way, of, living, in, its, true, essence, dharma, means, for, a, hindu, to, expand, the, mind, furthermore, it, represents, the, direct, connection, between, the, individual, and, the, societal, phenomena, that, bind, the, society, together, in, the, way, societal, phenomena, affect, the, conscience, of, the, individual, similarly, may, the, actions, of, an, individual, alter, the, course, of, the, society, for, better, or, for, worse, this, has, been, subtly, echoed, by, the, credo, meaning, dharma, is, that, which, holds, and, provides, support, to, the, social, construct, in, hinduism, dharma, generally, includes, various, aspects, the, history, section, of, this, article, discusses, the, development, of, dharma, concept, in, vedas, this, development, continued, in, the, upanishads, and, later, ancient, scripts, of, hinduism, in, upanishads, the, concept, of, dharma, continues, as, universal, principle, of, law, order, harmony, and, truth, it, acts, as, the, regulatory, moral, principle, of, the, universe, it, is, explained, as, law, of, righteousness, and, equated, to, satya, sanskrit, truth, in, hymn, 1, 4, 14, of, brhadaranyaka, upanishad, as, follows, nothing, is, higher, than, dharma, the, weak, overcomes, the, stronger, by, dharma, as, over, a, king, truly, that, dharma, is, the, truth, satya, therefore, when, a, man, speaks, the, truth, they, say, he, speaks, the, dharma, and, if, he, speaks, dharma, they, say, he, speaks, the, truth, for, both, are, one, mimamsa, developed, through, commentaries, on, its, foundational, texts, particularly, the, mimamsa, sutras, attributed, to, jaimini, emphasizes, the, desire, to, know, dharma, as, the, central, concern, defining, dharma, as, what, connects, a, person, with, the, highest, good, always, yet, to, be, realized, while, some, schools, associate, dharma, with, post, mortem, existence, mimamsakas, focus, on, continual, renewal, and, realization, of, a, ritual, world, through, adherence, to, vedic, injunctions, they, assert, that, the, ultimate, good, is, essentially, inaccessible, to, perception, and, can, only, be, understood, through, language, reflecting, confidence, in, vedic, injunctions, and, the, reality, of, language, as, a, means, of, knowing, the, hindu, religion, and, philosophy, claims, daniel, ingalls, places, major, emphasis, on, individual, practical, morality, in, the, sanskrit, epics, this, concern, is, omnipresent, in, the, second, book, of, the, ramayana, for, example, when, a, peasant, asks, the, king, to, do, what, dharma, morally, requires, of, him, the, king, agrees, and, does, accordingly, even, though, his, compliance, with, the, law, of, dharma, costs, him, dearly, in, hindu, epics, the, good, morally, upright, law, abiding, king, is, referred, to, as, dharmaraja, similarly, dharma, is, at, the, centre, of, all, major, events, in, the, life, of, rama, sita, and, lakshman, in, ramayana, each, episode, of, ramayana, presents, life, situations, and, ethical, questions, in, symbolic, terms, the, issue, is, debated, by, the, characters, and, finally, the, right, prevails, over, wrong, the, good, over, evil, in, the, mahabharata, dharma, is, central, and, it, is, presented, through, symbolism, and, metaphors, near, the, end, of, the, epic, yama, referred, to, as, dharma, in, the, text, is, portrayed, as, taking, the, form, of, a, dog, to, test, the, compassion, of, yudhishthira, who, is, told, he, may, not, enter, paradise, with, such, an, animal, yudhishthira, refuses, to, abandon, his, companion, for, which, he, is, then, praised, by, dharma, the, value, and, appeal, of, the, mahabharata, according, to, ingalls, is, not, as, much, in, its, complex, and, rushed, presentation, of, metaphysics, in, the, 12th, book, indian, metaphysics, he, argues, is, more, eloquently, presented, in, other, sanskrit, scriptures, instead, the, appeal, of, mahabharata, like, ramayana, lies, in, its, presentation, of, a, series, of, moral, problems, and, life, situations, where, there, are, usually, three, answers, one, answer, is, of, bhima, which, represents, brute, force, an, individual, angle, representing, materialism, egoism, and, self, the, second, answer, is, of, yudhishthira, which, appeals, to, piety, deities, social, virtue, and, tradition, the, third, answer, is, of, introspective, arjuna, which, falls, between, the, two, extremes, and, who, claims, ingalls, symbolically, reveals, the, finest, moral, qualities, of, man, the, epics, of, hinduism, are, a, symbolic, treatise, about, life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and, other, aspects, of, dharma, there, is, extensive, discussion, of, dharma, at, the, individual, level, in, the, epics, of, hinduism, for, example, on, free, will, versus, destiny, when, and, why, human, beings, believe, in, either, the, strong, and, prosperous, naturally, uphold, free, will, while, those, facing, grief, or, frustration, naturally, lean, towards, destiny, the, epics, of, hinduism, illustrate, various, aspects, of, dharma, with, metaphors, according, to, klaus, klostermaier, 4th, century, ce, hindu, scholar, v, tsy, yana, explained, dharma, by, contrasting, it, with, adharma, v, tsy, yana, suggested, that, dharma, is, not, merely, in, one, s, actions, but, also, in, words, one, speaks, or, writes, and, in, thought, according, to, v, tsy, yana, in, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, the, dharma, is, real, in, the, vedanta, it, is, unreal, dharma, is, part, of, yoga, suggests, patanjali, the, elements, of, hindu, dharma, are, the, attributes, qualities, and, aspects, of, yoga, patanjali, explained, dharma, in, two, categories, yamas, restraints, and, niyamas, observances, the, five, yamas, according, to, patanjali, are, abstain, from, injury, to, all, living, creatures, abstain, from, falsehood, satya, abstain, from, unauthorised, appropriation, of, things, of, value, from, another, acastrapurvaka, abstain, from, coveting, or, sexually, cheating, on, your, partner, and, abstain, from, expecting, or, accepting, gifts, from, others, the, five, yama, apply, in, action, speech, and, mind, in, explaining, yama, patanjali, clarifies, that, certain, professions, and, situations, may, require, qualification, in, conduct, for, example, a, fisherman, must, injure, a, fish, but, he, must, attempt, to, do, this, with, least, trauma, to, fish, and, the, fisherman, must, try, to, injure, no, other, creature, as, he, fishes, the, five, niyamas, observances, are, cleanliness, by, eating, pure, food, and, removing, impure, thoughts, such, as, arrogance, or, jealousy, or, pride, contentment, in, one, s, means, meditation, and, silent, reflection, regardless, of, circumstances, one, faces, study, and, pursuit, of, historic, knowledge, and, devotion, of, all, actions, to, the, supreme, teacher, to, achieve, perfection, of, concentration, dharma, is, an, empirical, and, experiential, inquiry, for, every, man, and, woman, according, to, some, texts, of, hinduism, for, example, apastamba, dharmasutra, states, dharma, and, adharma, do, not, go, around, saying, that, is, us, neither, do, gods, nor, gandharvas, nor, ancestors, declare, what, is, dharma, and, what, is, adharma, in, other, texts, three, sources, and, means, to, discover, dharma, in, hinduism, are, described, these, according, to, paul, hacker, are, first, learning, historical, knowledge, such, as, vedas, upanishads, the, epics, and, other, sanskrit, literature, with, the, help, of, one, s, teacher, second, observing, the, behaviour, and, example, of, good, people, the, third, source, applies, when, neither, one, s, education, nor, example, exemplary, conduct, is, known, in, this, case, atmatusti, is, the, source, of, dharma, in, hinduism, that, is, the, good, person, reflects, and, follows, what, satisfies, his, heart, his, own, inner, feeling, what, he, feels, driven, to, some, texts, of, hinduism, outline, dharma, for, society, and, at, the, individual, level, of, these, the, most, cited, one, is, manusmriti, which, describes, the, four, varnas, their, rights, and, duties, most, texts, of, hinduism, however, discuss, dharma, with, no, mention, of, varna, caste, other, dharma, texts, and, smritis, differ, from, manusmriti, on, the, nature, and, structure, of, varnas, yet, other, texts, question, the, very, existence, of, varna, bhrigu, in, the, epics, for, example, presents, the, theory, that, dharma, does, not, require, any, varnas, in, practice, medieval, india, is, widely, believed, to, be, a, socially, stratified, society, with, each, social, strata, inheriting, a, profession, and, being, endogamous, varna, was, not, absolute, in, hindu, dharma, individuals, had, the, right, to, renounce, and, leave, their, varna, as, well, as, their, asramas, of, life, in, search, of, moksa, while, neither, manusmriti, nor, succeeding, smritis, of, hinduism, ever, use, the, word, varnadharma, that, is, the, dharma, of, varnas, or, varnasramadharma, that, is, the, dharma, of, varnas, and, asramas, the, scholarly, commentary, on, manusmriti, use, these, words, and, thus, associate, dharma, with, varna, system, of, india, in, 6th, century, india, even, buddhist, kings, called, themselves, protectors, of, varnasramadharma, that, is, dharma, of, varna, and, asramas, of, life, at, the, individual, level, some, texts, of, hinduism, outline, four, ramas, or, stages, of, life, as, individual, s, dharma, these, are, 1, brahmac, rya, the, life, of, preparation, as, a, student, 2, g, hastha, the, life, of, the, householder, with, family, and, other, social, roles, 3, v, nprastha, or, aranyaka, the, life, of, the, forest, dweller, transitioning, from, worldly, occupations, to, reflection, and, renunciation, and, 4, sanny, sa, the, life, of, giving, away, all, property, becoming, a, recluse, and, devotion, to, moksa, spiritual, matters, patrick, olivelle, suggests, that, ashramas, represented, life, choices, rather, than, sequential, steps, in, the, life, of, a, single, individual, and, the, vanaprastha, stage, was, added, before, renunciation, over, time, thus, forming, life, stages, the, four, stages, of, life, complete, the, four, human, strivings, in, life, according, to, hinduism, dharma, enables, the, individual, to, satisfy, the, striving, for, stability, and, order, a, life, that, is, lawful, and, harmonious, the, striving, to, do, the, right, thing, be, good, be, virtuous, earn, religious, merit, be, helpful, to, others, interact, successfully, with, society, the, other, three, strivings, are, artha, the, striving, for, means, of, life, such, as, food, shelter, power, security, material, wealth, and, so, forth, kama, the, striving, for, sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional, fulfilment, and, so, forth, and, moksa, the, striving, for, spiritual, meaning, liberation, from, life, rebirth, cycle, self, realisation, in, this, life, and, so, forth, the, four, stages, are, neither, independent, nor, exclusionary, in, hindu, dharma, dharma, being, necessary, for, individual, and, society, is, dependent, on, poverty, and, prosperity, in, a, society, according, to, hindu, dharma, scriptures, for, example, according, to, adam, bowles, shatapatha, brahmana, 11, 1, 6, 24, links, social, prosperity, and, dharma, through, water, waters, come, from, rains, it, claims, when, rains, are, abundant, there, is, prosperity, on, the, earth, and, this, prosperity, enables, people, to, follow, dharma, moral, and, lawful, life, in, times, of, distress, of, drought, of, poverty, everything, suffers, including, relations, between, human, beings, and, the, human, ability, to, live, according, to, dharma, in,
