arminianism, is, a, movement, of, protestantism, initiated, in, the, early, 17th, century, based, on, the, theological, ideas, of, the, dutch, reformed, theologian, jacobus, arminius, and, his, historic, supporters, known, as, remonstrants, dutch, arminianism, was, originally, articulated, in, the, remonstrance, 1610, a, theological, statement, submitted, to, the, states, general, of, the, netherlands, this, expressed, an, attempt, to, moderate, the, doctrines, of, calvinism, related, to, its, interpretation, of, predestination, classical, arminianism, to, which, arminius, is, the, main, contributor, and, wesleyan, arminianism, to, which, john, wesley, is, the, main, contributor, are, the, two, main, schools, of, thought, central, arminian, beliefs, are, that, god, s, preparing, prevenient, grace, to, regeneration, is, universal, and, that, god, s, justifying, grace, allowing, regeneration, is, resistible, many, christian, denominations, have, been, influenced, by, arminian, views, notably, the, baptists, in, the, 17th, century, the, methodists, in, the, 18th, century, and, the, pentecostals, in, the, 20th, century, according, to, roger, e, olson, arminius, beliefs, i, e, arminianism, did, not, begin, with, him, denominations, such, as, the, waldensians, and, other, groups, prior, to, the, reformation, have, similarly, to, arminianism, affirmed, that, each, person, may, choose, the, contingent, response, of, either, resisting, god, s, grace, or, yielding, to, it, anabaptist, theologian, balthasar, hubmaier, also, promoted, much, the, same, view, as, arminius, nearly, a, century, before, him, the, soteriological, doctrines, of, arminianism, and, anabaptism, are, roughly, equivalent, in, particular, mennonites, have, been, historically, arminian, whether, they, distinctly, espoused, the, arminian, viewpoint, or, not, and, rejected, calvinism, soteriology, anabaptist, theology, seems, to, have, influenced, jacobus, arminius, at, least, he, was, sympathetic, to, the, anabaptist, point, of, view, and, anabaptists, were, commonly, in, attendance, on, his, preaching, similarly, arminius, mentions, danish, lutheran, theologian, niels, hemmingsen, as, holding, the, basic, view, of, soteriology, he, held, and, he, may, have, been, influenced, by, hemmingsen, jacobus, arminius, was, a, dutch, pastor, and, theologian, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, he, was, taught, by, theodore, beza, calvin, s, hand, picked, successor, but, after, examination, of, the, scriptures, he, rejected, his, teacher, s, theology, that, it, is, god, who, unconditionally, elects, some, for, salvation, instead, arminius, proposed, that, the, election, of, god, was, of, believers, thereby, making, it, conditional, on, faith, arminius, s, views, were, challenged, by, the, dutch, calvinists, especially, franciscus, gomarus, but, arminius, died, before, a, national, synod, could, occur, arminius, died, before, he, could, satisfy, the, request, by, holland, s, states, general, for, a, 14, page, paper, outlining, his, views, arminius, s, followers, replied, in, his, stead, crafting, the, five, articles, of, remonstrance, 1610, in, which, they, express, their, points, of, divergence, from, the, stricter, calvinism, of, the, belgic, confession, this, is, how, arminius, s, followers, were, called, remonstrants, and, following, a, counter, remonstrance, in, 1611, gomarus, followers, were, called, counter, remonstrants, after, some, political, maneuvering, the, dutch, calvinists, were, able, to, convince, prince, maurice, of, nassau, to, deal, with, the, situation, maurice, systematically, removed, arminian, magistrates, from, office, and, called, a, national, synod, at, dordrecht, this, synod, of, dort, was, open, primarily, to, dutch, calvinists, 102, people, while, the, arminians, were, excluded, 13, people, banned, from, voting, with, calvinist, representatives, from, other, countries, 28, people, and, in, 1618, published, a, condemnation, of, arminius, and, his, followers, as, heretics, part, of, this, publication, was, the, famous, five, points, of, calvinism, in, response, to, the, five, articles, of, remonstrance, arminians, across, holland, were, removed, from, office, imprisoned, banished, and, sworn, to, silence, twelve, years, later, holland, officially, granted, arminianism, protection, as, a, religion, although, animosity, between, arminians, and, calvinists, continued, most, of, the, early, remonstrants, followed, a, classical, version, of, arminianism, however, some, of, them, such, as, philipp, van, limborch, moved, in, the, direction, of, semi, pelagianism, and, rationalism, in, england, the, so, labelled, arminian, doctrines, were, held, in, substance, before, and, in, parallel, of, arminius, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, religion, finalised, in, 1571, were, sufficiently, ambiguous, that, they, were, compatible, with, either, arminian, or, calvinistic, interpretations, arminianism, in, the, church, of, england, was, fundamentally, an, expression, of, negation, of, calvinism, and, only, some, theologians, held, to, classical, arminianism, but, for, the, rest, they, were, either, semi, pelagian, or, pelagian, in, this, specific, context, contemporary, historians, prefer, to, use, the, term, proto, arminians, rather, than, arminians, to, designate, the, leanings, of, those, divines, who, generally, didn, t, follow, classical, arminianism, english, arminianism, was, represented, by, arminian, puritans, such, as, john, goodwin, or, high, anglican, arminians, such, as, jeremy, taylor, and, henry, hammond, anglican, arminians, of, the, 17th, century, such, as, william, laud, fought, calvinist, puritans, they, actually, saw, arminianism, in, terms, of, a, state, church, an, idea, that, was, alien, to, the, views, of, arminius, this, position, became, particularly, evident, under, the, reign, 1625, 1649, of, charles, i, of, england, following, the, english, civil, war, 1642, 1651, charles, ii, of, england, who, tolerated, the, presbyterians, re, instituted, arminian, thought, in, the, church, of, england, it, was, dominant, there, after, the, restoration, 1660, for, some, fifty, years, the, debate, between, calvin, s, followers, and, arminius, s, followers, is, characteristic, of, post, reformation, church, history, the, emerging, baptist, movement, in, 17th, century, england, for, example, was, a, microcosm, of, the, historic, debate, between, calvinists, and, arminians, the, first, baptists, called, general, baptists, because, of, their, confession, of, a, general, or, unlimited, atonement, were, arminians, the, baptist, movement, originated, with, thomas, helwys, who, left, his, mentor, john, smyth, who, had, moved, into, shared, belief, and, other, distinctives, of, the, dutch, waterlander, mennonites, of, amsterdam, and, returned, to, london, to, start, the, first, english, baptist, church, in, 1611, later, general, baptists, such, as, john, griffith, samuel, loveday, and, thomas, grantham, defended, a, reformed, arminian, theology, that, reflected, the, arminianism, of, arminius, the, general, baptists, encapsulated, their, arminian, views, in, numerous, confessions, the, most, influential, of, which, was, the, standard, confession, of, 1660, in, the, 1640s, the, particular, baptists, were, formed, diverging, from, arminian, doctrine, and, embracing, the, strong, calvinism, of, the, presbyterians, and, independents, their, robust, calvinism, was, publicized, in, such, confessions, as, the, london, baptist, confession, of, 1644, and, the, second, london, confession, of, 1689, the, london, confession, of, 1689, was, later, used, by, calvinistic, baptists, in, america, called, the, philadelphia, baptist, confession, whereas, the, standard, confession, of, 1660, was, used, by, the, american, heirs, of, the, english, general, baptists, who, soon, came, to, be, known, as, free, will, baptists, in, the, methodist, calvinist, controversy, of, the, early, 1770s, involving, anglican, ministers, john, wesley, and, george, whitefield, wesley, responded, to, accusations, of, semi, pelagianism, by, embracing, an, arminian, identity, wesley, had, limited, familiarity, with, the, beliefs, of, arminius, and, largely, formulated, his, views, without, direct, reliance, on, arminius, teachings, wesley, was, notably, influenced, by, 17th, century, english, arminianism, and, by, some, remonstrant, spokesmen, however, he, is, recognized, as, a, faithful, representative, of, arminius, beliefs, wesley, defended, his, soteriology, through, the, publication, of, a, periodical, titled, the, arminian, 1778, and, in, articles, such, as, predestination, calmly, considered, to, support, his, stance, he, strongly, maintained, belief, in, total, depravity, while, clarifying, other, doctrines, notably, prevenient, grace, at, the, same, time, wesley, attacked, the, determinism, that, he, claimed, characterized, calvinist, doctrines, of, predestination, he, typically, preached, the, notion, of, christian, perfection, fully, mature, not, sinlessness, his, system, of, thought, has, become, known, as, wesleyan, arminianism, the, foundations, of, which, were, laid, by, him, and, his, fellow, preacher, john, william, fletcher, methodism, also, navigated, its, own, theological, intricacies, concerning, salvation, and, human, agency, in, the, 1830s, during, the, second, great, awakening, traces, of, pelagian, influence, surfaced, in, the, american, holiness, movement, consequently, critics, of, wesleyan, theology, have, occasionally, unfairly, perceived, or, labeled, its, broader, thought, however, its, core, is, recognized, to, be, arminianism, pentecostalism, has, its, background, in, the, activity, of, charles, parham, 1873, 1929, its, origin, as, a, movement, was, in, the, azusa, street, revival, in, los, angeles, in, 1906, this, revival, was, led, by, william, j, seymour, 1870, 1922, due, to, the, methodist, and, holiness, background, of, many, early, pentecostal, preachers, the, pentecostal, churches, usually, possessed, practices, that, arose, from, the, wesleyan, arminianism, during, the, 20th, century, as, pentecostal, churches, began, to, settle, and, incorporate, more, standard, forms, they, started, to, formulate, theology, that, was, fully, arminian, today, the, two, largest, pentecostal, denominations, in, the, world, the, assemblies, of, god, and, the, pentecostal, church, of, god, denominations, hold, to, arminian, views, such, as, resistible, grace, conditional, election, or, conditional, security, of, the, believer, for, the, first, advocates, of, arminianism, find, a, home, in, many, protestant, denominations, and, sometimes, other, beliefs, such, as, calvinism, exist, within, the, same, denomination, the, lutheran, theological, tradition, bears, certain, similarities, to, arminianism, and, there, may, be, some, lutheran, churches, that, are, open, to, it, faiths, leaning, at, least, in, part, in, the, arminian, direction, include, some, of, high, church, anglicanism, anabaptist, denominations, such, as, the, mennonites, hutterites, amish, and, schwarzenau, brethren, adhere, to, anabaptist, theology, which, espouses, a, soteriology, that, is, similar, to, arminianism, in, some, respects, arminianism, is, found, within, the, general, baptists, including, the, subset, of, general, baptists, known, as, free, will, baptists, the, majority, of, southern, baptists, embrace, a, traditionalist, form, of, arminianism, which, includes, a, belief, in, eternal, security, though, many, see, calvinism, as, growing, in, acceptance, certain, proponents, of, arminianism, may, be, found, within, the, restoration, movement, in, the, christian, churches, and, churches, of, christ, additionally, it, is, found, in, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, arminianism, specifically, wesleyan, arminian, theology, is, taught, in, the, methodist, churches, inclusive, of, those, denominations, aligned, with, the, holiness, movement, such, as, the, evangelical, methodist, church, church, of, the, nazarene, the, free, methodist, church, the, wesleyan, church, and, the, salvation, army, it, is, also, found, in, a, part, of, the, charismatics, including, the, pentecostals, arminian, theology, has, found, support, among, theologians, bible, scholars, and, apologists, spanning, various, historical, periods, and, theological, circles, noteworthy, historical, figures, include, jacobus, arminius, simon, episcopius, hugo, grotius, john, goodwin, thomas, grantham, john, wesley, richard, watson, thomas, osmond, summers, john, miley, william, burt, pope, and, henry, orton, wiley, in, contemporary, baptist, traditions, advocates, of, arminian, theology, include, roger, e, olson, f, leroy, forlines, robert, picirilli, and, j, matthew, pinson, within, the, methodist, tradition, prominent, supporters, encompass, thomas, oden, ben, witherington, iii, david, pawson, b, j, oropeza, thomas, h, mccall, and, fred, sanders, the, holiness, movement, boasts, theologians, like, carl, o, bangs, and, j, kenneth, grider, furthermore, scholars, such, as, keith, d, stanglin, craig, s, keener, and, grant, r, osborne, also, support, arminian, perspectives, the, original, beliefs, of, jacobus, arminius, are, commonly, called, arminianism, but, more, broadly, the, term, may, embrace, the, teachings, of, simon, episcopius, hugo, grotius, john, wesley, and, others, arminian, theology, usually, falls, into, one, of, two, groups, classical, arminianism, drawn, from, the, teaching, of, jacobus, arminius, and, wesleyan, arminianism, drawing, primarily, from, wesley, the, two, groups, overlap, substantially, in, 529, at, the, second, council, of, orange, the, question, at, hand, was, whether, the, doctrines, of, augustine, on, god, s, providence, were, to, be, affirmed, or, if, semi, pelagianism, could, be, affirmed, semi, pelagianism, was, a, moderate, form, of, pelagianism, that, teaches, that, the, first, step, of, salvation, is, by, human, will, and, not, the, grace, of, god, the, determination, of, the, council, could, be, considered, semi, augustinian, it, defined, that, faith, though, a, free, act, of, man, resulted, even, in, its, beginnings, from, the, grace, of, god, enlightening, the, human, mind, and, enabling, belief, this, describes, the, operation, of, prevenient, grace, allowing, the, unregenerate, to, repent, in, faith, on, the, other, hand, the, council, of, orange, condemned, the, belief, in, predestination, to, damnation, implied, by, the, augustinian, soteriology, since, arminianism, is, aligned, with, those, characteristic, semi, augustinian, views, it, has, been, seen, by, some, as, a, reclamation, of, early, church, theological, consensus, moreover, arminianism, can, also, be, seen, as, a, soteriological, diversification, of, calvinism, or, more, specifically, as, a, theological, middle, ground, between, calvinism, and, semi, pelagianism, classical, arminianism, is, the, theological, system, that, was, presented, by, jacobus, arminius, and, maintained, by, some, of, the, remonstrants, theologians, as, forlines, and, olson, have, referred, to, this, system, as, classical, arminianism, while, others, as, picirilli, and, pinson, prefer, to, term, it, reformation, arminianism, or, reformed, arminianism, the, teachings, of, arminius, held, to, sola, fide, and, sola, gratia, of, the, reformation, but, they, were, distinct, from, particular, teachings, of, martin, luther, huldrych, zwingli, john, calvin, and, other, protestant, reformers, classical, arminianism, was, originally, articulated, in, the, five, articles, of, remonstrance, these, points, note, keith, d, stanglin, and, thomas, h, mccall, are, consistent, with, the, views, of, arminius, indeed, some, come, verbatim, from, his, declaration, of, sentiments, a, list, of, beliefs, of, classical, arminianism, is, given, below, arminianism, accepts, classical, theism, which, states, that, god, is, omnipresent, omnipotent, and, omniscient, in, that, view, god, s, power, knowledge, and, presence, have, no, external, limitations, that, is, outside, of, his, divine, nature, and, character, besides, arminianism, view, on, god, s, sovereignty, is, based, on, postulates, stemming, from, god, s, character, especially, as, fully, revealed, in, jesus, christ, on, the, first, hand, divine, election, must, be, defined, in, such, a, way, that, god, is, not, in, any, case, and, even, in, a, secondary, way, the, author, of, evil, it, would, not, correspond, to, the, character, of, god, on, the, other, hand, man, s, responsibility, for, evil, must, be, preserved, those, two, postulates, require, a, specific, way, by, which, god, chooses, to, manifest, his, sovereignty, when, interacting, with, his, creatures, on, one, hand, it, requires, for, god, to, operate, according, to, a, limited, mode, of, providence, this, means, that, god, deliberately, exercises, sovereignty, without, determining, every, event, on, the, other, hand, it, requires, for, god, s, election, to, be, a, predestination, by, foreknowledge, in, that, respect, god, s, foreknowledge, reconciles, with, human, free, will, in, the, following, way, human, free, will, is, limited, by, original, sin, though, god, s, prevenient, grace, restores, to, humanity, the, ability, to, accept, god, s, call, of, salvation, god, s, foreknowledge, of, the, future, is, exhaustive, and, complete, and, therefore, the, future, is, certain, and, not, contingent, on, human, action, god, does, not, determine, the, future, but, he, does, know, it, god, s, certainty, and, human, contingency, are, compatible, roger, olson, expressed, those, defining, ideas, in, a, more, practical, way, arminianism, is, simply, a, term, we, use, in, theology, for, the, view, held, by, some, people, before, arminius, and, many, after, him, that, sinners, who, hear, the, gospel, have, the, free, will, to, accept, or, reject, god, s, offer, of, saving, grace, and, that, nobody, is, excluded, by, god, from, the, possibility, of, salvation, except, those, who, freely, exclude, themselves, but, true, historical, classical, arminianism, includes, the, belief, that, this, free, will, is, itself, a, gift, of, god, through, prevenient, grace, depravity, is, total, arminius, states, in, this, state, the, free, will, of, man, towards, the, true, good, is, not, only, wounded, infirm, bent, and, weakened, but, it, is, also, imprisoned, destroyed, and, lost, and, its, powers, are, not, only, debilitated, and, useless, unless, they, be, assisted, by, grace, but, it, has, no, powers, whatever, except, such, as, are, excited, by, divine, grace, atonement, is, intended, for, all, jesus, s, death, was, for, all, people, jesus, draws, all, people, to, himself, and, all, people, have, opportunity, for, salvation, through, faith, jesus, s, death, satisfies, god, s, justice, the, penalty, for, the, sins, of, the, elect, is, paid, in, full, through, the, crucifixion, of, christ, thus, christ, s, death, atones, for, the, sins, of, all, but, requires, faith, to, be, effected, arminius, states, that, justification, when, used, for, the, act, of, a, judge, is, either, purely, the, imputation, of, righteousness, through, mercy, or, that, man, is, justified, before, god, according, to, the, rigor, of, justice, without, any, forgiveness, stephen, ashby, clarifies, arminius, allowed, for, only, two, possible, ways, in, which, the, sinner, might, be, justified, 1, by, our, absolute, and, perfect, adherence, to, the, law, or, 2, purely, by, god, s, imputation, of, christ, s, righteousness, w, stephen, gunter, concurs, that, arminius, would, not, take, a, rigid, position, on, the, doctrine, of, imputed, righteousness, the, righteousness, of, christ, is, imputed, for, righteousness, of, the, believer, for, keith, d, stanglin, and, thomas, h, mccall, arminius, would, not, object, to, saying, rather, that, the, righteousness, of, christ, is, imputed, to, righteousness, forlines, put, it, this, way, on, the, condition, of, faith, we, are, placed, in, union, with, christ, based, on, that, union, we, receive, his, death, and, righteousness, christ, s, atonement, has, a, substitutionary, effect, which, is, limited, only, to, the, elect, arminius, held, that, god, s, justice, was, satisfied, by, penal, substitution, hugo, grotius, taught, that, it, was, satisfied, governmentally, according, to, roger, olson, historical, and, contemporary, arminians, have, held, to, one, of, these, views, god, takes, initiative, in, the, salvation, process, and, his, grace, comes, to, all, people, this, grace, often, called, prevenient, grace, acts, on, all, people, to, convince, them, of, the, gospel, draw, them, strongly, towards, salvation, and, enable, the, possibility, of, sincere, faith, picirilli, states, that, indeed, this, grace, is, so, close, to, regeneration, that, it, inevitably, leads, to, regeneration, unless, finally, resisted, the, offer, of, salvation, through, grace, does, not, act, irresistibly, in, a, purely, cause, effect, deterministic, method, but, rather, in, an, influence, and, response, fashion, that, can, be, both, freely, accepted, and, freely, denied, man, has, a, freed, will, to, respond, or, resist, free, will, is, granted, and, limited, by, god, s, sovereignty, but, god, s, sovereignty, allows, all, men, the, choice, to, accept, the, gospel, of, jesus, through, faith, simultaneously, allowing, all, men, to, resist, conversion, is, synergistic, as, roger, olson, put, it, evangelical, synergism, reserves, all, the, power, ability, and, efficacy, in, salvation, to, grace, but, allows, humans, the, god, granted, ability, to, resist, or, not, resist, it, the, only, contribution, humans, make, is, nonresistance, to, grace, election, is, conditional, arminius, defined, election, as, the, decree, of, god, by, which, of, himself, from, eternity, he, decreed, to, justify, in, christ, believers, and, to, accept, them, unto, eternal, life, god, alone, determines, who, will, be, saved, and, his, determination, is, that, all, who, believe, jesus, through, faith, will, be, justified, according, to, arminius, god, regards, no, one, in, christ, unless, they, are, engrafted, in, him, by, faith, god, predestines, the, elect, to, a, glorious, future, predestination, is, not, the, predetermination, of, who, will, believe, but, rather, the, predetermination, of, the, believer, s, future, inheritance, the, elect, are, therefore, predestined, to, sonship, through, adoption, glorification, and, eternal, life, related, to, eschatological, considerations, jacobus, arminius, and, the, first, remonstrants, including, simon, episcopius, believed, in, everlasting, fire, where, the, wicked, are, thrown, by, god, at, judgment, day, preservation, is, conditional, all, believers, have, full, assurance, of, salvation, with, the, condition, that, they, remain, in, christ, salvation, is, conditioned, on, faith, therefore, perseverance, is, also, conditioned, arminius, believed, the, scriptures, taught, that, believers, are, graciously, empowered, by, christ, and, the, holy, spirit, to, fight, against, satan, sin, the, world, and, their, own, flesh, and, to, gain, the, victory, over, these, enemies, furthermore, christ, and, the, spirit, are, ever, present, to, aid, and, assist, believers, through, various, temptations, but, this, security, was, not, unconditional, but, conditional, provided, they, stand, prepared, for, the, battle, implore, his, help, and, be, not, wanting, to, themselves, christ, preserves, them, from, falling, arminius, believed, in, the, possibility, for, a, believer, to, commit, apostasy, i, e, desert, christ, by, cleaving, again, to, this, evil, world, losing, a, good, conscience, or, by, failing, to, hold, on, to, sound, doctrine, however, over, the, period, of, time, arminius, wrote, on, this, question, he, sometimes, expressed, himself, more, cautiously, out, of, consideration, for, the, faith, of, his, readers, for, instance, arminius, declared, in, 1599, that, this, matter, required, further, study, in, the, scriptures, arminius, said, also, in, his, declaration, of, sentiments, 1607, i, never, taught, that, a, true, believer, can, either, totally, or, finally, fall, away, from, the, faith, and, perish, yet, i, will, not, conceal, that, there, are, passages, of, scripture, which, seem, to, me, to, wear, this, aspect, and, those, answers, to, them, which, i, have, been, permitted, to, see, are, not, of, such, a, kind, as, to, approve, themselves, on, all, points, to, my, understanding, but, in, his, other, writings, he, expressed, certainty, about, the, possibility, of, falling, away, arminius, wrote, in, c, 1602, that, a, person, who, is, being, built, into, the, church, of, christ, may, resist, the, continuation, of, this, process, concerning, the, believers, he, said, it, may, suffice, to, encourage, them, if, they, know, that, no, power, or, prudence, can, dislodge, them, from, the, rock, unless, they, of, their, own, will, forsake, their, position, he, continued, by, saying, that, the, covenant, of, god, jeremiah, 23, does, not, contain, in, itself, an, impossibility, of, defection, from, god, but, a, promise, of, the, gift, of, fear, whereby, they, shall, be, hindered, from, going, away, from, god, so, long, as, that, shall, flourish, in, their, hearts, he, then, taught, that, had, king, david, died, in, his, sins, he, would, have, been, lost, in, 1602, arminius, also, wrote, a, believing, member, of, christ, may, become, slothful, give, place, to, sin, and, gradually, die, altogether, ceasing, to, be, a, member, for, arminius, a, certain, class, of, sin, would, cause, a, believer, to, fall, especially, sin, motivated, by, malice, in, 1605, arminius, wrote, but, it, is, possible, for, a, believer, to, fall, into, a, mortal, sin, as, is, seen, in, david, therefore, he, can, fall, at, that, moment, in, which, if, he, were, to, die, he, would, be, condemned, stanglin, and, mccall, point, out, that, arminius, clearly, identifies, two, paths, to, apostasy, 1, rejection, or, 2, malicious, sinning, bangs, observed, that, for, arminius, properly, speaking, it, is, impossible, for, a, believer, to, fall, away, it, may, be, possible, for, a, believer, to, cease, believing, oropeza, concludes, that, according, to, arminus, falling, away, is, ultimately, possible, after, the, death, of, arminius, in, 1609, his, followers, wrote, a, remonstrance, 1610, based, quite, literally, on, their, leader, s, declaration, of, sentiments, 1607, which, expressed, prudence, on, the, possibility, of, apostasy, in, particular, its, fifth, article, expressed, the, necessity, of, further, study, on, the, possibility, of, apostasy, sometime, between, 1610, and, the, official, proceeding, of, the, synod, of, dort, 1618, the, remonstrants, became, fully, persuaded, in, their, minds, that, the, scriptures, taught, that, a, true, believer, was, capable, of, falling, away, from, faith, and, perishing, eternally, as, an, unbeliever, they, formalized, their, views, in, the, opinion, of, the, remonstrants, 1618, which, was, their, official, stand, during, the, synod, of, dort, picirilli, remarks, ever, since, that, early, period, then, when, the, issue, was, being, examined, again, arminians, have, taught, that, those, who, are, truly, saved, need, to, be, warned, against, apostasy, as, a, real, and, possible, danger, they, later, expressed, this, same, view, in, the, remonstrant, confession, 1621, stanglin, points, out, that, arminius, held, that, if, the, apostasy, came, from, malicious, sin, then, it, was, forgivable, if, it, came, from, rejection, it, was, not, following, arminius, the, remonstrants, believed, that, though, possible, apostasy, was, not, in, general, irremediable, however, other, classical, arminians, as, the, free, will, baptists, have, taught, that, apostasy, is, irremediable, john, wesley, thoroughly, agreed, with, the, vast, majority, of, what, arminius, himself, taught, wesleyan, arminianism, is, classical, arminianism, with, the, addition, of, wesleyan, perfectionism, here, are, mentioned, some, positions, on, specific, issues, within, wesleyan, arminianism, steven, harper, proposed, that, wesley, s, atonement, is, a, hybrid, of, the, penal, substitution, theory, and, the, governmental, theory, however, theologians, robert, picirilli, roger, olson, and, darren, cushman, wood, consider, that, the, view, of, wesley, concerning, atonement, is, by, penal, substitution, wesleyan, arminians, have, historically, adopted, either, the, penal, or, governmental, theory, of, atonement, wesley, accepted, the, arminian, view, that, genuine, christians, could, apostatize, and, lose, their, salvation, as, his, famous, sermon, a, call, to, backsliders, clearly, demonstrates, harper, summarizes, as, follows, the, act, of, committing, sin, is, not, in, itself, ground, for, the, loss, of, salvation, the, loss, of, salvation, is, much, more, related, to, experiences, that, are, profound, and, prolonged, wesley, sees, two, primary, pathways, that, could, result, in, a, permanent, fall, from, grace, unconfessed, sin, and, the, actual, expression, of, apostasy, wesley, believed, that, such, apostasy, was, not, irremediable, when, talking, about, those, who, have, made, shipwreck, of, their, faith, 1, tim, 1, 19, wesley, claims, that, not, one, or, a, hundred, only, but, i, am, persuaded, several, thousands, innumerable, are, the, instances, of, those, who, had, fallen, but, now, stand, upright, one, issue, that, typifies, wesleyan, arminianism, is, christian, perfection, according, to, wesley, s, teaching, christians, could, attain, a, state, of, practical, perfection, meaning, a, lack, of, all, voluntary, sin, by, the, empowerment, of, the, holy, spirit, in, this, life, christian, perfection, or, entire, sanctification, according, to, wesley, is, purity, of, intention, dedicating, all, the, life, to, god, and, the, mind, which, was, in, christ, enabling, us, to, walk, as, christ, walked, it, is, loving, god, with, all, our, heart, and, our, neighbor, as, ourselves, it, is, a, restoration, not, only, to, the, favour, but, likewise, to, the, image, of, god, our, being, filled, with, the, fullness, of, god, wesley, was, clear, that, christian, perfection, did, not, imply, perfection, of, bodily, health, or, an, infallibility, of, judgment, it, also, does, not, mean, we, no, longer, violate, the, will, of, god, for, involuntary, transgressions, remain, perfected, christians, remain, subject, to, temptation, and, have, continued, need, to, pray, for, forgiveness, and, holiness, it, is, not, an, absolute, perfection, but, a, perfection, in, love, furthermore, wesley, did, not, teach, a, salvation, by, perfection, but, rather, says, that, even, perfect, holiness, is, acceptable, to, god, only, through, jesus, christ, the, majority, arminian, view, is, that, election, is, individual, and, based, on, god, s, foreknowledge, of, faith, according, to, the, corporate, election, view, god, never, chose, individuals, to, elect, to, salvation, but, rather, he, chose, to, elect, the, believing, church, to, salvation, jesus, was, the, only, human, ever, elected, and, individuals, must, be, in, christ, through, faith, to, be, part, of, the, elect, corporate, election, draws, support, from, a, similar, concept, of, corporate, election, found, in, the, old, testament, and, jewish, law, identity, stemmed, from, membership, in, a, group, more, than, individuality, pelagianism, is, a, doctrine, denying, original, sin, and, total, depravity, no, system, of, arminianism, founded, on, arminius, or, wesley, denies, original, sin, or, total, depravity, both, arminius, and, wesley, strongly, affirmed, that, man, s, basic, condition, is, one, in, which, he, cannot, be, righteous, understand, god, or, seek, god, arminius, referred, to, pelagianism, as, the, grand, falsehood, and, stated, that, he, must, confess, that, i, detest, from, my, heart, the, consequences, david, pawson, a, british, pastor, decries, this, association, as, libelous, when, attributed, to, arminius, or, wesley, s, doctrine, most, arminians, reject, all, accusations, of, pelagianism, some, schools, of, thought, notably, semi, pelagianism, which, teaches, that, the, first, step, of, salvation, is, by, human, will, are, confused, as, being, arminian, in, nature, but, classical, arminianism, and, wesleyan, arminianism, hold, that, the, first, step, of, salvation, is, through, the, prevenient, grace, of, god, though, the, subsequent, grace, entails, a, cooperative, relationship, calvinism, and, arminianism, while, sharing, historical, roots, and, many, theological, doctrines, diverge, notably, on, the, concepts, of, divine, predestination, and, election, while, some, perceive, these, differences, as, fundamental, others, regard, them, as, relatively, minor, distinctions, within, the, broader, spectrum, of, christian, theology, the, doctrine, of, open, theism, states, that, god, is, omnipresent, omnipotent, and, omniscient, but, differs, on, the, nature, of, the, future, open, theists, claim, that, the, future, is, not, completely, determined, or, settled, because, people, have, not, made, their, free, decisions, yet, god, therefore, knows, the, future, partially, in, possibilities, human, free, actions, rather, than, solely, certainties, divinely, determined, events, some, arminians, such, as, professor, and, theologian, robert, picirilli, reject, the, doctrine, of, open, theism, as, a, deformed, arminianism, joseph, dongell, stated, that, open, theism, actually, moves, beyond, classical, arminianism, towards, process, theology, there, are, also, some, arminians, like, roger, olson, who, believe, open, theism, to, be, an, alternative, view, that, a, christian, can, have
