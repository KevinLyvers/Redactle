range, of, traditions, including, christianity, gnosticism, neoplatonism, zoroastrianism, manichaeism, pythagoreanism, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, a, distinct, and, secretive, theology, characterized, by, an, esoteric, interpretation, of, scripture, that, emphasizes, the, importance, of, the, mind, and, truthfulness, druze, beliefs, include, the, concepts, of, theophany, and,

000, and, a, million, adherents, they, are, primarily, located, in, lebanon, syria, and, israel, with, smaller, communities, in, jordan, they, make, up, 5, 5, of, lebanon, s, population, 3, of, syria, and, 1, 6, of, israel, the, oldest, and, most, densely, populated, druze, communities, exist, in, mount, lebanon, and, in, the, south, of, syria, around, jabal, al, druze, literally, the, mountain, of, the, druze, the, druze, community, played, a, critically, important, role, in, shaping, the, history, of, the, levant, where, it, continues, to, play, a, significant, political, role, as, a, religious, minority, they, have, often, faced, persecution, from, various, muslim, regimes, including, contemporary, islamic, extremism, several, theories, about, the, origins, of, the, druze, have, been, proposed, with, the, arabian, hypothesis, being, the, most, widely, accepted, among, historians, intellectuals, and, religious, leaders, within, the, druze, community, this, hypothesis, significantly, influences, the, druze, s, self, perception, cultural, identity, and, both, oral, and, written, traditions, it, suggests, that, the, druze, are, descended, from, twelve, arab, tribes, that, migrated, to, syria, before, and, during, the, early, islamic, period, this, perspective, is, accepted, by, the, entire, druze, communities, in, syria, and, lebanon, as, well, as, by, most, druze, in, israel, the, name, druze, is, derived, from, the, name, of, muhammad, bin, ismail, nashtakin, ad, daraz, from, persian, darzi, seamster, who, was, an, early, preacher, although, the, druze, consider, ad, daraz, a, heretic, the, name, has, been, used, to, identify, them, possibly, by, their, historical, opponents, as, a, way, to, attach, their, community, with, ad, darazi, s, poor, reputation, before, becoming, public, the, movement, was, secretive, and, held, closed, meetings, in, what, was, known, as, sessions, of, wisdom, during, this, stage, a, dispute, occurred, between, ad, darazi, and, hamza, bin, ali, mainly, concerning, ad, darazi, s, ghuluww, exaggeration, which, refers, to, the, belief, that, god, was, incarnated, in, human, beings, to, ad, darazi, naming, himself, the, sword, of, the, faith, which, led, hamza, to, write, an, epistle, refuting, the, need, for, the, sword, to, spread, the, faith, and, several, epistles, refuting, the, beliefs, of, the, ghulat, in, 1016, ad, darazi, and, his, followers, openly, proclaimed, their, beliefs, and, called, people, to, join, them, causing, riots, in, cairo, against, the, unitarian, movement, including, hamza, bin, ali, and, his, followers, this, led, to, the, suspension, of, the, movement, for, one, year, and, the, expulsion, of, ad, darazi, and, his, supporters, although, the, druze, religious, books, describe, ad, darazi, as, the, insolent, one, and, as, the, calf, who, is, narrow, minded, and, hasty, the, name, druze, is, still, used, for, identification, and, for, historical, reasons, in, 1018, ad, darazi, was, assassinated, for, his, teachings, some, sources, claim, that, he, was, executed, by, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, some, authorities, see, in, the, name, druze, a, descriptive, epithet, derived, from, arabic, d, risah, she, who, studies, others, have, speculated, that, the, word, comes, from, the, persian, word, darazo, bliss, or, from, shaykh, hussayn, ad, daraz, who, was, one, of, the, early, converts, to, the, faith, in, the, early, stages, of, the, movement, the, word, druze, is, rarely, mentioned, by, historians, and, in, druze, religious, texts, only, the, word, muwa, id, n, unitarian, appears, the, only, early, arab, historian, who, mentions, the, druze, is, the, eleventh, century, christian, scholar, yahya, of, antioch, who, clearly, refers, to, the, heretical, group, created, by, ad, daraz, rather, than, the, followers, of, hamza, ibn, al, as, for, western, sources, benjamin, of, tudela, the, jewish, traveler, who, passed, through, lebanon, in, or, around, 1165, was, one, of, the, first, european, writers, to, refer, to, the, druze, by, name, the, word, dogziyin, druzes, occurs, in, an, early, hebrew, edition, of, his, travels, but, it, is, clear, that, this, is, a, scribal, error, be, that, as, it, may, he, described, the, druze, as, mountain, dwellers, monotheists, who, believe, in, soul, eternity, and, reincarnation, he, also, stated, that, they, loved, the, jews, the, number, of, druze, people, worldwide, is, between, 800, 000, and, one, million, with, the, vast, majority, residing, in, the, levant, the, primary, countries, with,

live, in, syria, 35, to, 40, live, in, lebanon, and, less, than, 10, live, in, israel, recently, there, has, been, a, growing, druze, diaspora, outside, the, middle, east, significant, druze,

and, follow, a, social, pattern, very, similar, to, those, of, the, other, peoples, of, the, levant, eastern, mediterranean, in, 2021, the, largest, druze, communities, outside, the, middle, east, are, in, venezuela, with, approximately, 60, 000, and, in, the, united, states, with, around, 50, 000, in, 2017, the, los, angeles, times, reported, about, 30, 000, druze, in, the, united, states, with, the, largest, concentration, in, southern, california, the, story, of, the, creation, of, the, druze, faith, in, the, days, between, 1017, and, 1018, is, dominated, by, three, men, and, their, struggle, for, influence, hamza, ibn, ali, ibn, ahmad, an, ismaili, mystic, and, scholar, from, zozan, khorasan, in, the, samanid, empire, arrived, in, fatimid, egypt, in, 1014, or, 1016, he,

the, support, of, the, f, timid, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, who, issued, a, decree, promoting, religious, freedom, and, eventually, became, a, central, figure, in, the, druze, faith, little, is, known, about, the, early, life, of, al, darazi, according, to, most, sources, he, was, born, in, bukhara, he, is, believed, to, have, been, of, persian, origins, and, his, title, al, darazi, is, persian, in, origin, meaning, the, tailor, he, arrived, in, cairo, in, 1015, or, 1017, after, which, he, joined, the, newly, emerged, druze, movement, al, darazi, was, converted, early, to, the, unitarian, faith, and, became, one, of, its, early, preachers, at, that, time, the, movement, enlisted, a, large, number, of, adherents, as, the, number, of, his, followers, grew, he, became, obsessed, with, his, leadership, and, gave, himself, the, title, the, sword, of, the, faith, al, darazi, argued, that, he, should, be, the, leader, of, the, da, wah, rather, than, hamza, ibn, ali, and, gave, himself, the, title, lord, of, the, guides, because, caliph, al, hakim, referred, to, hamza, as, guide, of, the, consented, it, is, said, that, al, darazi, allowed, wine, forbidden, marriages, and, taught, metempsychosis, although, this, may, be, exaggeration, by, contemporary, and, later, historians, and, polemicists, this, attitude, led, to, disputes, between, ad, darazi, and, hamza, ibn, ali, who, disliked, his, behavior, and, his, arrogance, in, the, epistles, of, wisdom, hamza, ibn, ali, ibn, ahmad, warns, al, darazi, saying, faith, does, not, need, a, sword, to, aid, it, but, al, darazi, ignored, hamza, s, warnings, and, continued, to, challenge, the, imam, the, divine, call, or, unitarian, call, is, the, druze, period, of, time, that, was, opened, at, sunset, on, thursday, 30, may, 1017, by, ad, darazi, the, call, summoned, people, to, a, true, unitarian, belief, that, removed, all, attributes, wise, just, outside, inside, etc, from, god, it, promoted, absolute, monotheism, and, the, concepts, of, supporting, your, fellow, man, true, speech, and, pursuit, of, oneness, with, god, these, concepts, superseded, all, ritual, law, and, dogma, and, requirements, for, pilgrimage, fasting, holy, days, prayer, charity, devotion, creed, and, particular, worship, of, any, prophet, or, person, was, downplayed, sharia, was, opposed, and, druze, traditions, started, during, the, call, continue, today, such, as, meeting, for, reading, prayer, and, social, gathering, on, a, thursday, instead, of, a, friday, at, khalwats, instead, of, mosques, such, gatherings, and, traditions, were, not, compulsory, and, people, were, encouraged, to, pursue, a, state, of, compliance, with, the, real, law, of, nature, governing, the, universe, epistle, thirteen, of, the, epistles, of, wisdom, called, it, a, spiritual, doctrine, without, any, ritualistic, imposition, the, time, of, the, call, was, seen, as, a, revolution, of, truth, with, missionaries, preaching, its, message, all, around, the, middle, east, these, messengers, were, sent, out, with, the, druze, epistles, and, took, written, vows, from, believers, whose, souls, are, thought, to, still, exist, in, the, druze, of, today, the, souls, of, those, who, took, the, vows, during, the, call, are, believed, to, be, continuously, reincarnating, in, successive, generations, of, druze, until, the, return, of, al, hakim, to, proclaim, a, second, divine, call, and, establish, a, golden, age, of, justice, and, peace, for, all, by, 1018, al, darazi, had, gathered, around, him, partisans, darazites, who, believed, that, universal, reason, became, incarnated, in, adam, at, the, beginning, of, the, world, was, then, passed, to, the, prophets, then, into, ali, and, then, into, his, descendants, the, fatimid, caliphs, al, darazi, wrote, a, book, laying, out, this, doctrine, but, when, he, read, from, his, book, in, the, principal, mosque, in, cairo, it, caused, riots, and, protests, against, his, claims, and, many, of, his, followers, were, killed, hamza, ibn, ali, rejected, al, darazi, s, ideology, calling, him, the, insolent, one, and, satan, the, controversy, led, caliph, al, hakim, to, suspend, the, druze, da, wah, in, 1018, in, an, attempt, to, gain, the, support, of, al, hakim, al, darazi, started, preaching, that, al, hakim, and, his, ancestors, were, the, incarnation, of, god, an, inherently, modest, man, al, hakim, did, not, believe, that, he, was, god, and, felt, al, darazi, was, trying, to, depict, himself, as, a, new, prophet, in, 1018, al, hakim, had, al, darazi, executed, leaving, hamza, the, sole, leader, of, the, new, faith, and, al, darazi, considered, to, be, a, renegade, al, hakim, disappeared, one, night, while, on, his, evening, ride, presumably, assassinated, perhaps, at, the, behest, of, his, formidable, elder, sister, sitt, al, mulk, the, druze, believe, he, went, into, occultation, with, hamza, ibn, ali, and, three, other, prominent, preachers, leaving, the, care, of, the, unitarian, missionary, movement, to, a, new, leader, al, muqtana, baha, uddin, the, call, was, suspended, briefly, between, 19, may, 1018, and, 9, may, 1019, during, the, apostasy, of, al, darazi, and, again, between, 1021, and, 1026, during, a, period, of, persecution, by, the, fatimid, caliph, al, zahir, li, i, zaz, din, allah, for, those, who, had, sworn, the, oath, to, accept, the, call, persecutions, started, forty, days, after, the, disappearance, into, occultation, of, al, hakim, who, was, thought, to, have, been, converting, people, to, the, unitarian, faith, for, over, twenty, years, prior, al, hakim, convinced, some, heretical, followers, such, as, al, darazi, of, his, soteriological, divinity, and, officially, declared, the, divine, call, after, issuing, a, decree, promoting, religious, freedom, al, hakim, was, replaced, by, his, underage, son, al, zahir, li, i, zaz, din, allah, the, unitarian, druze, movement, acknowledged, al, zahir, as, the, caliph, but, continued, to, regard, hamzah, as, its, imam, the, young, caliph, s, regent, sitt, al, mulk, ordered, the, army, to, destroy, the, movement, in, 1021, at, the, same, time, bah, al, d, n, was, assigned, the, leadership, of, the, unitarians, by, hamza, for, the, next, seven, years, the, druze, faced, extreme, persecution, by, al, zahir, li, i, zaz, din, allah, who, wanted, to, eradicate, the, faith, this, was, the, result, of, a, power, struggle, inside, of, the, fatimid, calphate, in, which, the, druze, were, viewed, with, suspicion, because, they, refused, to, recognize, the, new, caliph, as, their, imam, many, spies, mainly, the, followers, of, al, darazi, joined, the, unitarian, movement, to, infiltrate, the, druze, community, the, spies, set, about, agitating, trouble, and, soiling, the, reputation, of, the, druze, this, resulted, in, friction, with, the, new, caliph, who, clashed, militarily, with, the, druze, community, the, clashes, ranged, from, antioch, to, alexandria, where, tens, of, thousands, of, druze, were, slaughtered, by, the, fatimid, army, this, mass, persecution, known, by, the, druze, as, the, period, of, the, mihna, the, largest, massacre, was, at, antioch, where, 5000, prominent, druze, were, killed, followed, by, that, of, aleppo, as, a, result, the, faith, went, underground, in, hope, of, survival, as, those, captured, were, either, forced, to, renounce, their, faith, or, be, killed, druze, survivors, were, found, principally, in, southern, lebanon, and, syria, in, 1038, two, years, after, the, death, of, al, zahir, li, i, zaz, din, allah, the, druze, movement, was, able, to, resume, because, the, new, leadership, that, replaced, him, had, friendly, political, ties, with, at, least, one, prominent, druze, leader, in, 1043, baha, al, din, al, muqtana, declared, that, the, sect, would, no, longer, accept, new, pledges, and, since, that, time, proselytism, has, been, prohibited, awaiting, al, hakim, s, return, at, the, last, judgment, to, usher, in, a, new, golden, age, some, druze, and, non, druze, scholars, like, samy, swayd, and, sami, makarem, state, that, this, confusion, is, due, to, confusion, about, the, role, of, the, early, preacher, al, darazi, whose, teachings, the, druze, rejected, as, heretical, these, sources, assert, that, al, hakim, rejected, al, darazi, s, claims, of, divinity, and, ordered, the, elimination, of, his, movement, while, supporting, that, of, hamza, ibn, ali, wadi, al, taym, in, lebanon, was, one, of, the, two, most, important, centers, of, druze, missionary, activity, in, the, 11th, century, and, was, the, first, area, where, the, druze, appeared, in, the, historical, record, under, the, name, druze, it, is, generally, considered, the, birthplace, of, the, druze, faith, it, was, during, the, period, of, crusader, rule, in, levant, 1099, 1291, that, the, druze, first, emerged, into, the, full, light, of, history, in, the, gharb, region, of, the, chouf, as, powerful, warriors, serving, the, leaders, in, damascus, against, the, crusades, the, druze, were, given, the, task, of, keeping, watch, over, the, crusaders, in, the, seaport, of, beirut, to, prevent, them, from, making, any, encroachments, inland, subsequently, the, druze, chiefs, of, the, gharb, placed, their, considerable, military, experience, at, the, disposal, of, the, mamluk, sultans, in, egypt, 1250, 1516, first, to, assist, them, in, putting, an, end, to, what, remained, of, crusader, rule, in, the, coastal, levant, and, later, to, help, them, safeguard, the, lebanese, coast, against, crusader, retaliation, by, sea, in, the, early, period, of, the, crusader, era, the, druze, feudal, power, was, in, the, hands, of, two, families, the, tanukhs, and, the, arslans, from, their, fortresses, in, the, gharb, area, now, in, aley, district, of, southern, mount, lebanon, governorate, the, tanukhs, led, their, incursions, into, the, phoenician, coast, and, finally, succeeded, in, holding, beirut, and, the, marine, plain, against, the, franks, because, of, their, fierce, battles, with, the, crusaders, the, druze, earned, the, respect, of, the, sunni, caliphs, and, thus, gained, important, political, powers, after, the, middle, of, the, twelfth, century, the, maan, family, superseded, the, tanukhs, in, druze, leadership, the, origin, of, the, family, goes, back, to, prince, ma, an, who, made, his, appearance, in, lebanon, in, the, days, of, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mustarshid, 1118, 35, the, ma, ans, chose, for, their, abode, the, chouf, in, south, western, lebanon, southern, mount, lebanon, governorate, overlooking, the, maritime, plain, between, beirut, and, sidon, and, made, their, headquarters, in, baaqlin, which, is, still, a, leading, druze, village, they, were, invested, with, feudal, authority, by, sultan, nur, ad, din, zengi, and, furnished, respectable, contingents, to, the, muslim, ranks, in, their, struggle, against, the, crusaders, certain, aspects, of, the, faith, such, as, transmigration, of, souls, between, adherents, and, incarnation, were, viewed, as, heretical, or, kufr, infidelity, and, foreign, by, sunni, and, shia, muslims, but, contributed, to, solidarity, among, the, druze, who, closed, their, religion, to, new, converts, in, 1046, due, to, the, threat, of, persecution, the, proto, salafi, thinker, ibn, taymiyya, believed, the, druze, had, a, high, level, of, infidelity, besides, being, apostates, thus, they, were, not, trustworthy, and, should, not, be, forgiven, he, taught, also, that, muslims, cannot, accept, druze, penitence, nor, keep, them, alive, and, that, druze, property, should, be, confiscated, and, their, women, enslaved, having, cleared, the, holy, land, of, the, crusaders, the, mamluk, sultanate, now, turned, their, attention, to, the, schismatic, muslims, of, syria, in, 1305, after, the, issuing, of, a, fatwa, by, the, scholar, ibn, taymiyya, calling, for, jihad, against, all, non, sunni, muslim, groups, like, the, druze, alawites, isma, ilis, and, twelver, shi, a, al, nasir, muhammad, inflicted, a, disastrous, defeat, on, the, druze, at, keserwan, and, forced, outward, compliance, on, their, part, to, sunnism, the, sunni, mamluk, campaigns, led, to, the, destruction, of, many, christian, churches, and, monasteries, and, druze, sanctuaries, khilwat, and, caused, mass, destruction, of, maronite, and, druze, villages, and, the, killings, and, mass, displacement, of, its, inhabitants, lebanese, sunni, authors, generally, write, of, the, campaigns, from, a, pro, mamluk, stance, seeing, in, them, the, legitimate, muslim, state, s, efforts, to, incorporate, mount, lebanon, into, the, islamic, realm, while, druze, authors, write, with, a, focus, on, the, druze, community, s, consistent, connection, to, mount, lebanon, and, defense, of, its, practical, autonomy, later, the, druze, were, severely, attacked, at, saoufar, in, the, 1585, ottoman, expedition, against, the, druze, after, the, ottomans, claimed, that, the, druze, had, assaulted, their, caravans, near, tripoli, as, a, result, of, the, ottoman, experience, with, the, rebellious, druze, the, word, durzi, in, turkish, came, and, continues, to, mean, someone, who, is, the, ultimate, thug, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, witnessed, a, succession, of, armed, druze, rebellions, against, the, ottomans, countered, by, repeated, ottoman, punitive, expeditions, against, the, chouf, in, which, the, druze, population, of, the, area, was, severely, depleted, and, many, villages, destroyed, these, military, measures, severe, as, they, were, did, not, succeed, in, reducing, the, local, druze, to, the, required, degree, of, subordination, this, led, the, ottoman, government, to, agree, to, an, arrangement, whereby, the, different, nahiyahs, districts, of, the, chouf, would, be, granted, in, iltizam, fiscal, concession, to, one, of, the, region, s, amirs, or, leading, chiefs, leaving, the, maintenance, of, law, and, order, and, the, collection, of, taxes, in, the, area, in, the, hands, of, the, appointed, amir, this, arrangement, was, to, provide, the, cornerstone, for, the, privileged, status, ultimately, enjoyed, by, the, whole, of, mount, lebanon, druze, and, christian, areas, alike, with, the, advent, of, the, ottoman, turks, and, the, conquest, of, syria, by, sultan, selim, i, in, 1516, the, ma, ans, were, acknowledged, by, the, new, rulers, as, the, feudal, lords, of, southern, lebanon, druze, villages, spread, and, prospered, in, that, region, which, under, ma, an, leadership, so, flourished, that, it, acquired, the, generic, term, of, jabal, bayt, ma, an, the, mountain, home, of, the, ma, an, or, jabal, al, druze, the, latter, title, has, since, been, usurped, by, the, hawran, region, which, since, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, has, proven, a, haven, of, refuge, to, druze, emigrants, from, lebanon, and, has, become, the, headquarters, of, druze, power, under, fakhr, al, d, n, ii, fakhreddin, ii, the, druze, dominion, increased, until, it, included, lebanon, phoenicia, and, almost, all,

rights, in, shuf, and, kisrawan, passed, to, the, rising, shihab, family, through, female, line, inheritance, as, early, as, the, days, of, saladin, and, while, the, ma, ans, were, still, in, complete, control, over, southern, lebanon, the, shihab, tribe, originally, hijaz, arabs, but, later, settled, in, awran, advanced, from, awran, in, 1172, and, settled, in, wadi, al, taym, at, the, foot, of, mount, hermon, they, soon, made, an, alliance, with, the, ma, ans, and, were, acknowledged, as, the, druze, chiefs, in, wadi, al, taym, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, 1697, the,

of, the, majority, of, their, subjects, the, shihab, leadership, continued, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, and, culminated, in, the, illustrious, governorship, of, amir, bashir, shihab, ii, 1788, 1840, who, after, fakhr, al, din, was, the, most, powerful, feudal, lord, lebanon, produced, though, governor, of, the, druze, mountain, bashir, was, a, crypto, christian, and, it, was, he, whose, aid, napoleon, solicited, in, 1799, during, his, campaign, against, syria, the, druze, christian, alliance, during, this, century, was, the, major, factor, enabling, the, shehab, dynasty, to, maintain, power, having, consolidated, his, conquests, in, syria, 1831, 1838, ibrahim, pasha, son, of, the, viceroy, of, egypt, muhammad, ali, pasha, made, the, fatal, mistake, of, trying, to, disarm, the, christians, and, druze, of, the, lebanon, and, to, draft, the, latter, into, his, army, this, was, contrary, to, the, principles, of, the, life, of, independence, which, these, mountaineers, had, always, lived, and, resulted, in, a, general, uprising, against, egyptian, rule, the, druze, of, wadi, al, taym, and, awran, under, the, leadership, of, shibli, al, aryan, distinguished, themselves, in, their, stubborn, resistance, at, their, inaccessible, headquarters, al, laja, lying, southeast, of, damascus, the, conquest, of, syria, by, the, muslim, arabs, in, the, middle, of, the, seventh, century, introduced, into, the, land, two, political, factions, later, called, the, qaysites, and, the, yemenites, the, qaysite, party, represented, the, bedouin, arabs, who, were, regarded, as, inferior, by, the, yemenites, who, were, earlier, and, more, cultured, emigrants, into, syria, from, southern, arabia, druze, and, christians, grouped, in, political, rather, than, religious, parties, the, party, lines, in, lebanon, obliterated, ethnic, and, religious, lines, and, the, people, grouped, themselves, into, one, or, the, other, of, these, two, parties, regardless, of, their, religious, affiliations, the, sanguinary, feuds, between, these, two, factions, depleted, in, course, of, time, the, manhood, of, the, lebanon, and, ended, in, the, decisive, battle, of, ain, dara, in, 1711, which, resulted, in, the, utter, defeat, of, the, yemenite, party, many, yemenite, druze, thereupon, migrated, to, the, hauran, region, laying, the, foundation, of, druze, power, there, the, qays, were, led, by, emir, haydar, of, the, shihab, dynasty, and, consisted, of, the, druze, clans, of, jumblatt, talhuq, imad, and, abd, al, malik, and, the, maronite, clan, of, khazen, the, yamani, faction, was, led, by, mahmoud, abu, harmoush, and, consisted, of, the, druze, alam, al, din, arslan, and, sawaf, clans, the, yamani, faction, also, had, backing, from, the, ottoman, provincial, authorities, of, sidon, and, damascus, the, battle, ended, in, a, rout, of, the, yamani, faction, and, resulted, in, the, consolidation, of, qaysi, political, and, fiscal, domination, over, mount, lebanon, the, battle, s, outcome, also, precipitated, a, mass, migration, of, pro, yamani, druze, nobility, and, peasants, from, mount, lebanon, to, the, eastern, hauran, in, a, mountainous, area, today, known, as, jabal, al, druze, this, area, had, seen, previous, waves, of, druze, migration, starting, in, 1685, consequently, the, maronite, christian, population, in, mount, lebanon, became, the, dominant, group, the, yamani, druze, exodus, significantly, contributed, to, a, demographic, shift, in, mount, lebanon, with, maronites, and, other, christians, namely, from, the, greek, orthodox, and, melkite, sects, making, up, a, large, share, of, the, population, at, the, expense, of, the, druze, the, relationship, between, the, druze, and, christians, has, been, characterized, by, harmony, and, coexistence, with, amicable, relations, between, the, two, groups, prevailing, throughout, history, with, the, exception, of, some, periods, including, 1860, civil, conflict, in, mount, lebanon, and, damascus, in, 1840, social, disturbance, started, between, druze, and, their, christian, maronite, neighbors, who, had, previously, been, on, friendly, terms, this, culminated, in, the, civil, war, of, 1860, after, the, shehab, dynasty, converted, to, christianity, some, prominent, druze, families, including, the, druze, abi, lamma, clan, who, were, close, allies, of, the, shihabs, also, converted, to, christianity, and, joined, the, maronite, church, the, druze, community, and, feudal, leaders, came, under, attack, from, the, regime, with, the, collaboration, of, the, maronite, catholic, church, and, the, druze, lost, most, of, their, political, and, feudal, powers, also, the, druze, formed, an, alliance, with, britain, and, allowed, protestant, missionaries, to, enter, mount, lebanon, creating, tension, between, them, and, the, catholic, maronites, the, maronite, druze, conflict, in, 1840, 60, was, an, outgrowth, of, the, maronite, independence, movement, directed, against, the, druze, druze, feudalism, and, the, ottoman, turks, the, civil, war, was, not, therefore, a, religious, war, except, in, damascus, where, it, spread, and, where, the, vastly, non, druze, population, was, anti, christian, this, animosity, was, fueled, by, economic, disparities, with, christians, who, were, generally, wealthier, and, more, prosperous, compare, to, the, economically, struggling, muslim, residents, the, movement, culminated, with, the, 1859, 60, massacre, and, defeat, of, the, maronites, by, the, druze, the, civil, war, of, 1860, cost, the, maronites, some, ten, thousand, lives, in, damascus, zahl, deir, al, qamar, hasbaya, and, other, towns, of, lebanon, the, european, powers, then, determined, to, intervene, and, authorized, the, landing, in, beirut, of, a, body, of, french, troops, under, general, beaufort, d, hautpoul, whose, inscription, can, still, be, seen, on, the, historic, rock, at, the, mouth, of, nahr, al, kalb, french, intervention, on, behalf, of, the, maronites, did, not, help, the, maronite, national, movement, since, france, was, restricted, in, 1860, by, the, british, government, which, did, not, want, the, ottoman, empire, dismembered, but, european, intervention, pressured, the, turks, to, treat, the, maronites, more, justly, following, the, recommendations, of, the, powers, the, ottoman, porte, granted, lebanon, local, autonomy, guaranteed, by, the, powers, under, a, maronite, governor, this, autonomy, was, maintained, until, world, war, i, the, maronite, catholics, and, the, druze, founded, modern, lebanon, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, through, the, ruling, and, social, system, known, as, the, maronite, druze, dualism, which, developed, in, ottoman, era, mount, lebanon, mutasarrifate, creating, one, of, the, calmest, atmospheres, that, lebanon, had, ever, lived, in, the, ruling, and, social, system, in, the, mount, lebanon, mutasarrifate, was, formed, from, the, maronite, druze, dualism, and, the, security, stability, and, druze, maronite, coexistence, in, the, mutasarrifate, allowed, the, development, of, the, economy, and, the, system, of, government, the,

originated, in, local, disputes, and, druze, unwillingness, to, pay, taxes, and, conscript, into, the, ottoman, army, the, rebellion, ended, in, brutal, suppression, of, the, druze, by, general, sami,

the, countries, they, reside, in, though, they, have, a, strong, community, feeling, in, which, they, identify, themselves, as, related, even, across, borders, of, countries, although, most, druze, no, longer, consider, themselves, muslim, al, azhar, of, egypt, recognized, them, in, 1959, as, one, of, the, islamic, sects, in, the, al, azhar, shia, fatwa, due, to, political, reasons, as, gamal, abdel, nasser, saw, it, as, a, tool, to, spread, his, appeal, and, influence, across, the, entire, arab, world, the, druze, religion, does, not, endorse, separatism, and, urges, blending, with, the, communities, they, reside, in, the, druze, have, often, done, so, to, avoid, persecution, yet, the, druze, also, have, a, history, of, resistance, to, occupying, powers, and, they, have, at, times, enjoyed, more, freedom, than, most, other, groups, living, in, the, levant, in, syria, most, druzites, live, in, the, jebel, al, druze, a, rugged, and, mountainous, region, in, the, southwest, of, the, country, which, is, more, than, 90, percent, druze, inhabited, some, 120, villages, are, exclusively, so, other, notable, communities, live, in, the, harim, mountains, the, damascus, suburb, of, jaramana, and, on, the, southeast, slopes, of, mount, hermon, a, large, syrian, druze, community, historically, lived, in, the, golan, heights, but, following, wars, with, israel, in, 1967, and, 1973, many, of, these, druze, fled, to, other, parts, of, syria, most, of, those, who, remained, live, in, a, handful, of, villages, in, the, disputed, zone, while, only, a, few, live, in, the, narrow, remnant, of, quneitra, governorate, that, is, still, under, effective, syrian, control, the, druze, always, played, a, far, more, important, role, in, syrian, politics, than, its, comparatively, small, population, would, suggest, with, a, community, of, little, more, than, 100, 000, in, 1949, or, roughly, three, percent, of, the, syrian, population, the, druze, of, syria, s, southwestern,

from, french, rule, without, british, assistance, at, independence, the, druze, made, confident, by, their, successes, expected, that, damascus, would, reward, them, for, their, many, sacrifices, on, the, battlefield, they, demanded, to, keep, their, autonomous, administration, and, many, political, privileges, accorded, them, by, the, french, and, sought, generous, economic, assistance, from, the, newly, independent, government, when, a, local, paper, in, 1945, reported, that, president, shukri, al, quwatli, 1943, 49, had, called, the, druze, a, dangerous, minority, sultan, pasha, al,

warriors, would, occupy, the, city, of, damascus, quwwatli, could, not, dismiss, sultan, pasha, s, threat, the, military, balance, of, power, in, syria, was, tilted, in, favor, of, the, druze, at,

immigrants, to, the, united, states, converted, to, protestantism, becoming, communicants, of, the, presbyterian, or, methodist, churches, the, druze, conception, of, the, deity, is, declared, by, them, to, be, one, of, strict, and, uncompromising, unity, the, main, druze, doctrine, states, that, god, is, both, transcendent, and, immanent, in, which, he, is, above, all, attributes, but, at, the, same, time, he, is, present, in, their, desire, to, maintain, a, rigid, confession, of, unity, they, stripped, from, god, all, attributes, tanz, h, in, god, there, are, no, attributes, distinct, from, his, essence, he, is, wise, mighty, and, just, not, by, wisdom, might, and, justice, but, by, his, own, essence, god, is, the, whole, of, existence, rather, than, above, existence, or, on, his, throne, which, would, make, him, limited, there, is, neither, how, when, nor, where, about, him, he, is, incomprehensible, in, this, dogma, they, are, similar, to, the, semi, philosophical, semi, religious, body, which, flourished, under, al, ma, mun, and, was, known, by, the, name, of, mu, tazila, and, the, fraternal, order, of, the, brethren, of, purity, ikhwan, al, afa, unlike, the, mu, tazila, and, similar, to, some, branches, of, sufism, the, druze, believe, in, the, concept, of, tajalli, meaning, theophany, tajalli, is, often, misunderstood, by, scholars, and, writers, and, is, usually, confused, with, the, concept, of, incarnation, is, the, core, spiritual, beliefs, in, the, druze, and, some, other, intellectual, and, spiritual, traditions, in, a, mystical, sense, it, refers, to, the, light, of, god, experienced, by, certain, mystics, who, have, reached, a, high, level, of, purity, in, their, spiritual, journey, thus, god, is, perceived, as, the, lahut, who, manifests, his, light, in, the, station, maqaam, of, the, nasut, without, the, nasut, becoming, lahut, this, is, like, one, s, image, in, the, mirror, one, is, in, the, mirror, but, does, not, become, the, mirror, the, druze, manuscripts, are, emphatic, and, warn, against, the, belief, that, the, nasut, is, god, neglecting, this, warning, individual, seekers, scholars, and, other, spectators, have, considered, al, hakim, and, other, figures, divine, in, the, druze, scriptural, view, tajalli, takes, a, central, stage, one, author, comments, that, tajalli, occurs, when, the, seeker, s, humanity, is, annihilated, so, that, divine, attributes, and, light, are, experienced, by, the, person, druze, sacred, texts, include, the, quran, and, the, epistles, of, wisdom, other, ancient, druze, writings, include, the, rasa, il, al, hind, epistles, of, india, and, the, previously, lost, or, hidden, manuscripts, such, as, al, munfarid, bi, dhatihi, and, al, sharia, al, ruhaniyya, as, well, as, others, including, didactic, and, polemic, treatises, reincarnation, is, a, paramount, principle, in, the, druze, faith, reincarnations, occur, instantly, at, one, s, death, because, there, is, an, eternal, duality, of, the, body, and, the, soul, and, it, is, impossible, for, the, soul, to, exist, without, the, body, a, human, soul, will, transfer, only, to, a, human, body, in, contrast, to, the, neoplatonic, hindu, and, buddhist, belief, systems, according, to, which, souls, can, transfer, to, any, living, creature, furthermore, a, male, druze, can, be, reincarnated, only, as, another, male, druze, and, a, female, druze, only, as, another, female, druze, a, druze, cannot, be, reincarnated, in, the, body, of, a, non, druze, additionally, souls, cannot, be, divided, and, the, number, of, souls, existing, in, the, universe, is, finite, the, cycle, of, rebirth, is, continuous, and, the, only, way, to, escape, is, through, successive, reincarnations, when, this, occurs, the, soul, is, united, with, the, cosmic, mind, and, achieves, the, ultimate, happiness, the, pact, of, time, custodian, mith, q, wal, al, zam, n, is, considered, the, entrance, to, the, druze, religion, and, they, believe, that, all, druze, in, their, past, lives, have, signed, this, charter, and, druze, believe, that, this, charter, embodies, with, human, souls, after, death, i, rely, on, our, moula, al, hakim, the, lonely, god, the, individual, the, eternal, who, is, out, of, couples, and, numbers, someone, the, son, of, someone, has, approved, recognition, enjoined, on, himself, and, on, his, soul, in, a, healthy, of, his, mind, and, his, body, permissibility, aversive, is, obedient, and, not, forced, to, repudiate, from, all, creeds, articles, and, all, religions, and, beliefs, on, the, differences, varieties, and, he, does, not, know, something, except, obedience, of, almighty, moulana, al, hakim, and, obedience, is, worship, and, that, it, does, not, engage, in, worship, anyone, ever, attended, or, wait, and, that, he, had, handed, his, soul, and, his, body, and, his, money, and, all, he, owns, to, almighty, maulana, al, hakim, the, druze, also, use, a, similar, formula, called, al, ahd, when, one, is, initiated, into, the, uqq, l, the, prayer, houses, of, the, druze, are, called, khilwa, khalwa, khilwat, or, khalwat, the, primary, sanctuary, of, the, druze, is, at, khalwat, al, bayada, the, druze, believe, that, many, teachings, given, by, prophets, religious, leaders, and, holy, books, have, esoteric, meanings, preserved, for, those, of, intellect, in, which, some, teachings, are, symbolic, and, allegorical, in, nature, and, divide, the, understanding, of, holy, books, and, teachings, into, three, layers, these, layers, according, to, the, druze, are, as, follows, druze, do, not, believe, that, the, esoteric, meaning, abrogates, or, necessarily, abolishes, the, exoteric, one, hamza, bin, ali, refutes, such, claims, by, stating, that, if, the, esoteric, interpretation, of, taharah, purity, is, purity, of, the, heart, and, soul, it, doesn, t, mean, that, a, person, can, discard, his, physical, purity, as, salat, prayer, is, useless, if, a, person, is, untruthful, in, his, speech, and, that, the, esoteric, and, exoteric, meanings, complement, each, other, the, druze, follow, seven, moral, precepts, or, duties, that, are, considered, the, core, of, the, faith, the, seven, druze, precepts, are, complicating, their, identity, is, the, custom, of, taqiyya, concealing, or, disguising, their, beliefs, when, necessary, that, they, adopted, from, ismailism, and, the, esoteric, nature, of, the, faith, in, which, many, teachings, are, kept, secretive, this, is, done, in, order, to, keep, the, religion, from, those, who, are, not, yet, prepared, to, accept, the, teachings, and, therefore, could, misunderstand, it, as, well, as, to, protect, the, community, when, it, is, in, danger, some, claim, to, be, muslim, or, christian, in, order, to, avoid, persecution, some, do, not, druze, in, different, states, can, have, radically, different, lifestyles, hamza, ibn, ali, ibn, ahmad, is, considered, the, founder, of, the, druze, and, the,

from, islam, he, also, added, that, as, a, result, of, this, deviation, the, druze, faith, seems, as, different, from, islam, as, islam, is, from, christianity, or, christianity, is, from, judaism,

and, maintain, a, strong, sense, of, identity, and, solidarity, a, key, aspect, of, their, religious, practice, includes, ziyarat, or, visits, to, holy, places, one, of, the, most, significant, events, in, druze, religious, life, is, the, annual, pilgrimage, to, the, shrine, of, shu, ayb, observed, between, april, 25, and, 28, this, pilgrimage, is, dedicated, to, shu, ayb, whom, druze, believe, to, be, a, prophet, and, whose, purported, tomb, is, located, at, this, shrine, this, event, is, so, important, that, it, is, officially, recognized, as, a, public, holiday, in, israel, the, mother, tongue, of, druze, in, syria, lebanon, and, israel, is, levantine, arabic, except, those, born, and, living, in, the, druze, diaspora, such, as, venezuela, where, arabic, was, not, taught, or, spoken, at, home, the, druze, arabic, dialect, especially, in, the, rural, areas, is, often, different, from, the, other, regional, arabic, dialects, druze, arabic, dialect, is, distinguished, from, others, by, retention, of, the, phoneme, q, the, use, of, which, by, druze, is, particularly, prominent, in, the, mountains, and, less, so, in, urban, areas, the, druze, citizens, of, israel, are, arabic, in, language, and, culture, and, linguistically, speaking, the, majority, of, them, are, fluently, bilingual, speaking, both, a, central, northern, levantine, arabic, dialect, and, hebrew, in, druze, arab, homes, and, towns, in, israel, the, primary, language, spoken, is, arabic, while, some, hebrew, words, have, entered, the, colloquial, arabic, dialect, they, often, use, hebrew, characters, to, write, their, arabic, dialect, online, various, scholars, agree, that, the, druze, community, s, cultural, identity, is, deeply, intertwined, with, their, arab, heritage, historian, nejla, abu, izzedin, and, kamal, salibi, both, argue, that, the, druze, are, profoundly, embedded, within, the, arab, cultural, framework, as, demonstrated, by, their, common, language, and, social, customs, they, assert, that, this, integration, is, apparent, through, the, druze, s, active, participation, in, regional, traditions, and, their, assimilation, into, arab, society, despite, their, distinct, religious, and, philosophical, beliefs, scholar, robert, brenton, betts, explains, that, the, druze, social, structure, is, characterized, by, a, strong, sense, of, community, and, the, leadership, of, religious, elders, known, as, sheikhs, these, leaders, are, pivotal, in, guiding, both, the, spiritual, and, social, aspects, of, druze, life, which, is, crucial, for, preserving, their, unique, identity, betts, also, points, to, specific, druze, practices, such, as, the, annual, pilgrimage, to, the, shrine, of, shu, ayb, as, examples, of, how, these, traditions, along, with, the, role, of, the, sheikhs, are, deeply, ingrained, in, druze, social, life, he, argues, that, these, practices, are, not, just, religious, rituals, but, are, fundamental, to, reinforcing, druze, unity, and, continuity, according, to, some, scholars, the, druze, cultural, identity, is, shaped, by, their, interactions, with, both, christian, and, muslim, communities, reflecting, a, synthesis, of, religious, and, cultural, influences, historians, notes, that, the, druze, have, historically, maintained, a, positive, relationship, with, christians, as, evidenced, by, shared, traditions, and, social, practices, in, mount, lebanon, this, interaction, has, led, to, overlapping, symbols, customs, mutual, veneration, of, saints, and, their, shrines, and, shared, terminology, for, god, sites, such, as, the, church, of, saidet, et, tall, in, deir, el, qamar, historically, a, popular, marian, pilgrimage, site, among, the, druze, exemplify, this, cultural, exchange, the, druze, also, venerate, christian, saints, like, saint, george, and, the, prophet, elijah, admired, for, their, bravery, and, warrior, like, qualities, scholar, pierre, yves, beaurepaire, observes, that, these, warrior, saints, resonate, with, the, druze, due, to, their, parallels, with, druze, militarized, traditions, conversely, despite, sharing, historical, roots, with, muslims, the, druze, often, experience, a, more, complex, relationship, with, muslim, communities, due, to, their, distinct, religious, beliefs, and, practices, historically, the, druze, faced, significant, persecution, from, muslim, regimes, which, led, them, to, keep, their, religious, beliefs, secret, according, to, druze, narrative, these, acts, of, persecution, were, aimed, at, eradicating, the, entire, community, this, narrative, has, shaped, the, druze, sense, of, identity, and, their, awareness, of, survival, as, a, survival, strategy, some, druze, have, historically, posed, as, muslims, a, practice, known, as, taqiya, this, concealment, has, led, to, a, synthesis, of, druze, religious, practice, and, cultural, identity, with, islamic, elements, as, noted, by, scholars, druze, cuisine, is, arab, cuisine, and, shares, many, similarities, with, other, levantine, cuisines, it, features, a, rich, array, of, grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread, whole, grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh, fish, and, tomatoes, a, hallmark, of, druze, and, levantine, cuisine, is, meze, including, tabbouleh, hummus, and, baba, ghanoush, kibbeh, nayyeh, is, also, a, popular, mezze, among, the, druze, other, well, known, dishes, among, druzes, include, falafel, sfiha, shawarma, dolma, kibbeh, kusa, mahshi, shishbarak, muhammara, and, mujaddara, among, the, popular, traditional, arabic, dessert, by, the, druze, is, knafeh, in, israel, the, saj, bread, is, known, as, druze, pita, as, it, was, easier, for, israeli, jews, to, identify, with, druze, than, with, arabs, it, is, a, pita, filled, with, labneh, thick, yoghurt, and, topped, with, olive, oil, and, za, atar, and, a, very, popular, bread, in, israel, al, meleh, a, popular, dish, among, druze, in, hauran, region, as, suwayda, governorate, cooked, in, a, pressure, cooker, and, served, on, huge, special, plates, at, weddings, holidays, and, other, special, occasions, and, consists, of, bulgur, wheat, immersed, in, ghee, with, lamb, and, yogurt, and, served, hot, with, fried, kibbeh, and, vegetables, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, the, mulukhiyah, dish, was, banned, by, the, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, sometime, during, his, reign, 996, 1021, while, the, ban, was, eventually, lifted, after, the, end, of, his, reign, the, druze, who, hold, al, hakim, in, high, regard, and, give, him, quasi, divine, authority, continue, to, respect, the, ban, and, do, not, eat, mulukhiyah, of, any, kind, to, this, day, mate, in, levantine, arabic, m, te, is, a, popular, drink, consumed, by, the, druze, brought, to, the, levant, by, syrian, migrants, from, argentina, in, the, 19th, century, mate, is, made, by, steeping, dried, leaves, of, the, south, american, plant, yerba, mate, in, hot, water, and, is, served, with, a, metal, straw, bamb, ja, or, ma, ah, from, a, gourd, finj, n, or, qar, ah, mate, is, often, the, first, item, served, when, entering, a, druze, home, it, is, a, social, drink, and, can, be, shared, between, multiple, participants, after, each, drinker, the, metal, straw, is, cleaned, with, lemon, rind, traditional, snacks, eaten, with, mate, include, raisins, nuts, dried, figs, biscuits, and, chips, the, druze, rejection, of, polygamy, unlike, in, traditional, islamic, traditions, reflects, a, significant, influence, from, christianity, on, their, faith, while, the, druze, cite, certain, quranic, verses, to, justify, their, position, it, more, closely, mirrors, the, christian, perspective, on, marriage, additionally, the, practice, of, monasticism, by, some, druze, sheikhs, is, highly, regarded, within, their, community, it, s, not, uncommon, for, a, sheikh, to, request, celibacy, from, his, fianc, e, and, many, druze, sheikhs, remain, unmarried, throughout, their, lives, in, druze, belief, sex, is, seen, not, as, an, end, in, itself, but, as, a, means, of, reproduction, with, certain, sexual, forms, considered, sinful, the, druze, doctrine, not, permit, outsiders, to, convert, to, their, religion, as, only, one, who, is, born, to, druze, parents, can, be, considered, a, druze, marriage, outside, the, druze, faith, is, uncommon, and, strongly, discouraged, for, both, males, and, females, if, a, druze, individual, whether, male, or, female, marries, a, non, druze, they, may, face, ostracism, and, marginalization, from, their, community, since, a, non, druze, partner, cannot, convert, to, the, druze, faith, the, couple, cannot, have, druze, children, as, the, druze, faith, can, only, be, inherited, from, two, druze, parents, at, birth, marrying, a, non, druze, whether, male, or, female, is, viewed, as, apostasy, from, the, druze, religion, the, druze, community, holds, a, negative, perception, of, apostates, who, marry, outside, the, religion, consequently, those, who, leave, the, druze, religion, due, to, interfaith, marriage, are, forced, to, leave, their, village, and, are, exiled, to, distant, non, druze, areas, this, religious, and, social, pressure, leads, to, their, isolation, and, classification, as, outcasts, within, their, druze, community, the, druze, faith, is, often, classified, as, a, branch, of, isma, ilism, although, according, to, various, scholars, druze, faith, diverge, substantially, from, islam, both, sunni, and, shia, even, though, the, faith, originally, developed, out, of, ismaili, islam, most, druze, do, not, identify, as, muslims, and, they, do, not, accept, the, five, pillars, of, islam, historian, david, r, w, bryer, defines, the, druzes, as, ghulat, of, isma, ilism, since, they, exaggerated, the, cult, of, the, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, and, considered, him, divine, he, also, defines, the, druzes, as, a, religion, that, deviated, from, islam, he, also, added, that, as, a, result, of, this, deviation, the, druze, faith, seems, as, different, from, islam, as, islam, is, from, christianity, or, christianity, is, from, judaism, historically, the, relationship, between, the, druze, and, muslims, has, been, characterized, by, intense, persecution, the, druze, have, frequently, experienced, persecution, by, different, muslim, regimes, such, as, the, shia, fatimid, caliphate, mamluk, sunni, ottoman, empire, and, egypt, eyalet, the, persecution, of, the, druze, included, massacres, demolishing, druze, prayer, houses, and, holy, places, and, forced, conversion, to, islam, those, acts, of, persecution, were, meant, to, eradicate, the, whole, community, according, to, the, druze, narrative, most, recently, the, syrian, civil, war, which, began, in, 2011, saw, persecution, of, the, druze, at, the, hands, of, islamic, extremists, since, druze, emerged, from, islam, and, share, certain, beliefs, with, islam, its, position, of, whether, it, is, a, separate,

setting, would, have, legitimized, violence, against, them, as, apostates, the, ottoman, empire, often, relied, on, ibn, taymiyya, s, religious, ruling, to, justify, their, persecution, of, druze, in, contrast, according, to, ibn, abidin, whose, work, radd, al, muhtar, ala, al, durr, al, mukhtar, is, still, considered, the, authoritative, text, of, hanafi, fiqh, today, the, druze, are, neither,

reasons, as, gamal, abdel, nasser, saw, it, as, a, tool, to, spread, his, appeal, and, influence, across, the, entire, arab, world, in, 2012, due, to, a, drift, towards, salafism, in, al, azhar, and,

tudela, a, jewish, traveler, from, the, 12th, century, pointed, out, that, the, druze, maintained, good, commercial, relations, with, the, jews, nearby, and, according, to, him, this, was, because, the, druze, liked, the, jewish, people, yet, the, jews, and, druze, lived, isolated, from, each, other, except, in, few, mixed, towns, such, as, deir, al, qamar, and, peki, in, the, deir, el, qamar,

conversely, the, druze, community, in, syria, lebanon, and, the, golan, heights, generally, aligns, with, arab, nationalism, and, holds, predominantly, anti, zionist, views, from, 1957, the, israeli, government, formally, recognized, the, druze, as, a, separate, religious, community, and, are, defined, as, a, distinct, ethnic, group, in, the, israeli, ministry, of, interior, s, census, registration, israeli, druze, do, not, consider, themselves, muslim, and, see, their, faith, as, a, separate, and, independent, religion, while, compared, to, other, israeli, christians, and, muslims, druze, place, less, emphasis, on, their, arab, identity, and, self, identify, more, as, israeli, however, they, were, less, ready, for, personal, relationships, with, jews, compared, to, israeli, muslims, and, christians, scholars, attribute, this, trend, to, cultural, differences, between, jews, and, druze, in, terms, of, religious, comparison, scholars, consider, judaism, and, the, druze, faith, as, ethnoreligious, groups, both, practicing, endogamy, and, both, typically, do, not, proselytize, belief, in, reincarnation, gilgul, exist, in, some, strands, of, judaism, influenced, by, the, kabbalah, such, as, hasidic, judaism, but, is, rejected, by, mainstream, jewish, denominations, reform, judaism, conservative, judaism, and, orthodox, judaism, figures, in, the, hebrew, bible, such, as, adam, noah, abraham, and, moses, are, considered, important, prophets, of, god, in, the, druze, faith, being, among, the, seven, prophets, who, appeared, in, different, periods, of, history, both, religions, venerate, elijah, job, and, other, common, figures, in, the, hebrew, bible, jethro, was, moses, father, in, law, a, kenite, shepherd, and, priest, of, midian, jethro, of, midian, is, considered, an, ancestor, of, the, druze, who, revere, him, as, their, spiritual, founder, and, chief, prophet, a, study, carried, out, by, th, israeli, druze, historian, kais, m, firro, examines, various, theories, about, the, origins, of, the, druze, including, possible, connections, to, the, arameans, arabs, itureans, cuthites, hivites, armenians, persians, and, turks, some, even, suggested, a, european, origin, in, the, 17th, century, there, was, a, prevailing, belief, in, france, that, the, druze, were, descendants, of, a, lost, army, of, european, christian, crusaders, according, to, this, notion, after, the, fall, of, the, christian, stronghold, of, acre, in, 1291, and, the, subsequent, persecution, by, the, victorious, mamluks, these, crusaders, sought, refuge, in, the, mountains, of, lebanon, and, settled, there, permanently, according, to, firro, two, main, approaches, have, been, used, to, trace, druze, origins, the, first, examines, religious, texts, and, the, ethnic, backgrounds, of, the, early, druze, leaders, the, second, focuses, on, the, migration, and, settlement, patterns, of, ancient, peoples, and, tribes, in, the, druze, regions, before, the, 11th, century, the, third, approach, relies, on, anthropometric, studies, the, main, proponent, of, the, first, approach, is, historian, philip, hitti, whose, theory, is, a, key, reference, for, tracing, druze, origins, hitti, proposed, that, the, druze, are, a, blend, of, persians, iraqis, and, persianized, arabs, who, adopted, new, beliefs, he, supported, this, with, three, arguments, first, the, early, founders, and, disseminators, of, the, druze, religion, were, of, persians, origin, second, some, of, the, druze, religious, lexicon, is, persian, and, third, the, native, inhabitants, of, wadi, al, taym, where, druze, faith, beliefs, first, spread, were, influenced, by, persian, and, iraqi, or, persianized, arab, cultures, before, 1077, however, martin, sprengling, criticized, hitti, s, theory, arguing, that, not, all, early, druze, leaders, were, of, persian, origin, citing, baha, al, din, al, muqtana, as, an, example, of, arab, origin, sprengling, also, noted, that, wadi, al, taym, s, inhabitants, before, 1077, were, mostly, pure, arab, tribes, such, as, the, tanukhids, and, taym, allah, tribe, he, concluded, that, the, druze, are, mainly, a, combination, of, various, ethnic, groups, with, a, major, influence, from, arabs, particularly, southern, arabs, along, with, an, indigenous, mountain, population, of, aramaic, origin, additionally, two, english, researchers, gertrude, bell, and, david, hogarth, also, proposed, that, the, druze, are, a, blend, of, arabs, from, southern, arabia, and, the, mountain, dwelling, aramaeans, the, second, approach, used, by, druze, historians, scholars, intellectuals, and, clerics, emphasizes, the, migration, and, settlement, of, arab, tribes, to, highlight, the, pure, arab, lineage, of, those, who, adopted, druze, beliefs, in, the, 11th, century, proponents, argue, that, the, druze, speak, a, pure, arab, dialect, and, are, of, pure, arab, blood, not, mixed, with, turkish, or, other, influences, due, to, their, practice, of, strict, endogamy, marriage, this, view, maintains, that, most, druze, are, descended, from, 12, arab, tribes, that, migrated, to, syria, before, the, islamic, period, it, relies, on, historical, records, druze, chronicles, and, genealogical, trees, reconstructed, by, druze, families, to, trace, their, ancestry, and, settlement, in, syria, according, to, firro, all, druze, historians, scholars, and, leaders, in, lebanon, and, syria, consider, the, druze, to, be, arabs, and, this, view, is, accepted, by, the, entire, druze, community, in, those, countries, in, contrast, while, most, druze, in, israel, consider, themselves, arabs, some, israeli, druze, politicians, have, begun, to, reject, the, idea, of, arabic, racial, origin, as, a, component, of, druze, national, identity, for, political, reasons, according, to, firro, the, third, approach, in, the, research, on, druze, origins, is, based, on, the, conclusions, of, researchers, and, anthropologists, studies, by, felix, von, luschan, arries, and, kappers, found, that, druze, in, the, levant, along, with, their, muslim, and, christian, counterparts, share, the, same, origins, similarly, druze, historian, nejla, abu, izzedin, has, concluded, that, druze, christians, and, muslims, in, the, levant, have, the, same, racial, background, according, to, druze, historian, amin, talea, druze, oral, and, written, traditions, recount, that, twelve, arab, tribes, converted, to, islam, and, fought, alongside, muslim, warriors, until, they, were, introduced, to, the, druze, religion, by, preachers, sent, from, egypt, by, the, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, talea, adds, that, over, time, the, druze, developed, a, strong, sense, of, their, pure, arab, origins, believing, that, apart, from, their, unique, religious, practices, their, spiritual, and, material, culture, closely, mirrored, that, of, the, broader, population, of, greater, syria, the, druze, faith, extended, to, many, areas, in, the, middle, east, but, most, of, the, modern, druze, can, trace, their, origin, to, the, wadi, al, taym, in, southern, lebanon, which, is, named, after, an, arab, tribe, taym, allah, or, taym, allat, which, according, to, islamic, historian, al, tabari, first, came, from, the, arabian, peninsula, into, the, valley, of, the, euphrates, where, they, had, been, christianized, prior, to, their, migration, into, lebanon, many, of, the, druze, feudal, families, whose, genealogies, have, been, preserved, by, the, two, modern, syrian, chroniclers, haydar, al, shihabi, and, ahmad, faris, al, shidyaq, seem, also, to, point, in, the, direction, of, this, origin, arabian, tribes, emigrated, via, the, persian, gulf, and, stopped, in, iraq, on, their, route, that, would, later, to, lead, them, to, syria, the, first, feudal, druze, family, the, tanukhids, which, made, for, itself, a, name, in, fighting, the, crusaders, was, according, to, haydar, al, shihabi, an, arab, tribe, from, mesopotamia, where, it, occupied, the, position, of, a, ruling, family, and, apparently, was, christianized, travelers, like, niebuhr, and, scholars, like, max, von, oppenheim, undoubtedly, echoing, the, popular, druze, belief, regarding, their, own, origin, have, classified, them, as, arabs, the, arabian, hypothesis, is, widely, regarded, as, the, leading, explanation, for, the, origins, of, the, druze, people, among, historians, scholars, intellectuals, and, religious, leaders, within, the, druze, community, this, theory, suggests, that, the, druze, descended, from, twelve, arab, tribes, that, migrated, to, syria, before, and, during, the, early, islamic, period, it, also, serves, as, the, primary, framework, for, understanding, their, historical, and, racial, origins, as, reflected, in, their, oral, traditions, and, written, literature, this, hypothesis, is, central, to, the, druze, s, self, perception, and, cultural, identity, this, view, is, accepted, by, the, entire, druze, community, in, syria, and, lebanon, as, well, as, by, most, druze, in, israel, the, arabic, language, is, spoken, by, the, druze, and, is, also, the, language, in, which, their, sacred, texts, are, written, scholars, who, hold, this, view, argue, that, this, linguistic, connection, underscores, the, druze, s, ethnic, arab, identity, according, to, druze, historian, nejla, abu, izzedin, the, druze, people, are, of, arab, origin, both, culturally, and, historically, she, explains, that, druze, traditions, and, narratives, consistently, trace, their, roots, to, arab, tribes, who, settled, in, syria, some, prior, to, the, advent, of, islam, and, others, during, the, muslim, conquest, abu, izzedin, further, notes, that, when, the, druze, community, was, established, its, members, were, spread, across, a, wide, area, of, syria, the, majority, of, those, who, embraced, the, druze, faith, were, arab, tribes, from, the, northern, region, making, the, arab, elements, of, the, community, predominant, according, to, abu, izzedin, ethnically, the, wadi, al, taym, has, been, authoritatively, stated, to, be, one, of, the, most, arab, regions, of, syria, the, area, was, one, of, the, two, most, important, centers, of, druze, missionary, activity, in, the, 11th, century, additionally, abu, izzedin, highlights, that, the, tanukhids, an, arab, tribe, hold, a, significant, place, in, druze, history, she, asserts, that, the, druze, claims, of, arab, origin, were, not, driven, by, self, interest, as, arabs, were, no, longer, in, a, dominant, position, when, the, druze, community, was, founded, in, the, 11th, century, furthermore, druze, narratives, recount, their, involvement, in, pivotal, events, in, arab, history, in, modern, times, the, druze, have, largely, adopted, arab, nationalism, and, played, a, notable, role, in, the, great, syrian, revolt, of, 1920, s, druze, scholar, sami, makarem, notes, that, wadi, taym, and, southern, lebanon, jabal, amel, were, pivotal, centers, for, druze, missionary, activity, in, the, 11th, century, inhabited, by, arab, tribes, he, explains, that, druze, oral, traditions, and, religious, documents, suggest, that, most, druze, ancestors, came, from, twelve, arab, tribes, in, maarat, al, numan, during, the, early, period, of, islam, and, its, conquests, later, they, migrated, and, settled, in, lebanon, makarem, highlights, the, druze, s, strong, arab, heritage, noting, that, early, druze, followers, were, predominantly, of, arab, descent, he, also, points, out, that, many, tribes, settling, in, the, levant, before, islam, came, from, southern, arabia, including, yamani, and, qaysi, tribes, according, to, makarem, druze, belief, links, their, ancestry, to, tribes, that, lived, in, syria, some, before, islam, and, others, arriving, during, the, conquest, israeli, druze, historian, salman, hamud, fallah, asserted, that, the, druze, people, of, today, originated, from, the, arabian, peninsula, he, noted, that, some, of, their, ancestors, came, from, the, northern, part, of, the, peninsula, while, others, came, from, the, southern, region, specifically, yemen, in, addition, israeli, druze, historian, yusri, hazran, describes, the, druze, narrative, which, holds, that, twelve, arab, tribes, migrated, into, the, syrian, region, either, before, the, rise, of, islam, or, during, the, early, islamic, period, these, tribes, were, predominantly, of, yamani, tribes, with, the, tanukhids, being, the, most, dominant, among, them, subsequently, these, tribes, adopted, the, druze, doctrine, hazran, affirms, that, this, narrative, is, recognized, within, druze, doctrine, and, its, scriptures, druze, researchers, and, historians, from, israel, such, as, kais, m, firro, rabah, halabi, munir, fakhr, el, din, and, afifa, e, kheir, confirm, that, the, druze, are, arabs, and, note, that, this, was, not, a, contentious, issue, in, israel, before, 1962, halabi, observes, that, israeli, policies, aimed, at, granting, the, druze, a, distinct, community, status, and, political, identity, led, some, druze, to, see, this, separate, druze, israeli, identity, as, an, ethnic, marker, for, social, integration, within, israeli, society, firro, argues, that, efforts, to, create, a, separate, druze, identity, distinct, from, arabs, are, politically, motivated, and, lack, historical, basis, citing, druze, religious, and, historical, literature, that, affirms, their, arab, heritage, scholar, michael, cohen, adds, that, despite, the, israeli, and, zionist, narrative, promoting, a, distinct, druze, ethnic, identity, most, druze, in, israel, view, their, origins, as, arab, and, consider, their, druze, identity, primarily, as, religious, the, 1911, edition, of, encyclop, dia, britannica, states, that, the, druze, are, a, mixture, of, refugee, stocks, in, which, the, arab, largely, predominates, grafted, on, to, an, original, mountain, population, of, aramaic, blood, according, to, jewish, contemporary, literature, the, druze, who, were, visited, and, described, in, 1165, by, benjamin, of, tudela, were, pictured, as, descendants, of, the, itureans, an, ismaelite, arab, tribe, which, used, to, reside, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, golan, plateau, through, hellenistic, and, roman, periods, the, word, druzes, in, an, early, hebrew, edition, of, his, travels, occurs, as, dogziyin, but, it, is, clear, that, this, is, a, scribal, error, archaeological, assessments, of, the, druze, region, have, also, proposed, the, possibility, of, druze, descending, from, itureans, who, had, inhabited, mount, lebanon, and, golan, heights, in, late, classic, antiquity, but, their, traces, fade, in, the, middle, ages, lebanese, christians, and, druze, became, a, genetic, isolate, in, the, predominantly, islamic, world, in, a, 2005, study, of, aspm, gene, variants, mekel, bobrov, et, al, found, that, the, israeli, druze, people, of, the, mount, carmel, region, have, among, the, highest, rate, of, the, newly, evolved, aspm, haplogroup, d, at, 52, 2, occurrence, of, the, approximately, 6, 000, year, old, allele, while, it, is, not, yet, known, exactly, what, selective, advantage, is, provided, by, this, gene, variant, the, haplogroup, d, allele, is, thought, to, be, positively, selected, in, populations, and, to, confer, some, substantial, advantage, that, has, caused, its, frequency, to, rapidly, increase, a, 2004, dna, study, has, shown, that, israeli, druze, are, remarkable, for, the, high, frequency, 35, of, males, who, carry, the, y, chromosomal, haplogroup, l, which, is, otherwise, uncommon, in, the, middle, east, shen, et, al, 2004, this, haplogroup, originates, from, prehistoric, south, asia, and, has, spread, from, pakistan, into, southern, iran, a, 2008, study, done, on, larger, samples, showed, that, l, m20, averages, 27, in, mount, carmel, druze, 2, in, galilee, druze, 8, in, lebanese, druze, and, it, was, not, found, in, a, sample, of, 59, syrian, druze, slush, et, al, 2008, cruciani, in, 2007, found, e1b1b1a2, e, v13, in, high, levels, 10, of, the, male, population, in, cypriot, and, druze, lineages, recent, genetic, clustering, analyses, of, ethnic, groups, are, consistent, with, the, close, ancestral, relationship, between, the, druze, and, cypriots, and, also, identified, similarity, to, the, general, syrian, and, lebanese, populations, as, well, as, the, major, jewish, divisions, ashkenazi, sephardi, iraqi, and, moroccan, jews, behar, et, al, 2010, also, a, new, study, concluded, that, the, druze, harbor, a, remarkable, diversity, of, mitochondrial, dna, lineages, that, appear, to, have, separated, from, each, other, thousands, of, years, ago, but, instead, of, dispersing, throughout, the, world, after, their, separation, the, full, range, of, lineages, can, still, be, found, within, the, druze, population, the, researchers, noted, that, the, druze, villages, contained, a, striking, range, of, high, frequency, and, high, diversity, of, the, x, haplogroup, suggesting, that, this, population, provides, a, glimpse, into, the, past, genetic, landscape, of, the, near, east, at, a, time, when, the, x, haplogroup, was, more, prevalent, these, findings, are, consistent, with, the, druze, oral, tradition, that, claims, that, the, adherents, of, the, faith, came, from, diverse, ancestral, lineages, stretching, back, tens, of, thousands, of, years, the, shroud, of, turin, analysis, shows, significant, traces, of, mitochondrial, dna, unique, to, the, druze, community, a, 2008, study, published, on, the, genetic, background, of, druze, communities, in, israel, showed, highly, heterogeneous, parental, origins, a, total, of, 311, israeli, druze, were, sampled, 37, from, the, golan, heights, 183, from, the, galilee, and, 35, from, mount, carmel, as, well, as, 27, druze, immigrants, from, syria, and, 29, from, lebanon, slush, et, al, 2008, the, researchers, found, the, following, frequencies, of, y, chromosomal, and, mtdna, haplogroups, according, to, a, 2015, study, druze, have, a, largely, similar, genome, with, middle, eastern, arabs, but, they, have, not, married, outside, of, their, clans, in, 1000, years, and, druze, families, from, different, regions, share, a, similarity, with, each, other, that, distinguishes, them, from, other, middle, eastern, populations, a, 2016, study, based, on, testing, samples, of, druze, in, the, historic, region, of, syria, in, comparison, with, ancient, humans, including, anatolian, and, armenian, and, on, geographic, population, structure, gps, tool, by, converting, genetic, distances, into, geographic, distances, concluded, that, druze, might, hail, from, the, zagros, mountains, and, the, surroundings, of, lake, van, in, eastern, anatolia, then, they, later, migrated, south, to, settle, in, the, mountainous, regions, in, syria, lebanon, and, israel, a, 2020, study, on, remains, from, canaanaite, bronze, age, southern, levantine, populations, suggests, a, significant, degree, of, genetic, continuity, in, currently, arabic, speaking, levantine, populations, including, the, druze, lebanese, palestinians, and, syrians, as, well, as, in, most, jewish, groups, including, sephardi, jews, ashkenazi, jews, mizrahi, jews, and, maghrebi, jews, from, the, populations, of, the, bronze, age, levant, suggesting, that, the, aforementioned, groups, all, derive, more, than, half, of, their, overall, ancestry, atdna, from, canaanite, bronze, age, levantine, populations, albeit, with, varying, sources, and, degrees, of, admixture, from, differing, host, or, invading, populations, depending, on, each, group, in, a, principal, component, analysis, of, a, 2014, study, druze, were, located, between, lebanese, people, and, mizrahi, jews, in, a, pca, in, a, 2021, study, druze, were, close, to, lebanese, people, and, a, part, of, the, larger, levant, iraq, cluster, remove, ye, the, causes, of, fear, and,
