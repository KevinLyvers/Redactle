moses, was, a, hebrew, prophet, teacher, and, leader, according, to, abrahamic, tradition, he, is, considered, the, most, important, prophet, in, judaism, and, samaritanism, and, one, of, the, most, important, prophets, in, christianity, islam, the, bah, faith, and, other, abrahamic, religions, according, to, both, the, bible, and, the, quran, moses, was, the, leader, of, the, israelites, and, lawgiver, to, whom, the, prophetic, authorship, of, the, torah, the, first, five, books, of, the, bible, is, attributed, according, to, the, book, of, exodus, moses, was, born, in, a, time, when, his, people, the, israelites, an, enslaved, minority, were, increasing, in, population, and, as, a, result, the, egyptian, pharaoh, worried, that, they, might, ally, themselves, with, egypt, s, enemies, moses, hebrew, mother, jochebed, secretly, hid, him, when, pharaoh, ordered, all, newborn, hebrew, boys, to, be, killed, in, order, to, reduce, the, population, of, the, israelites, through, pharaoh, s, daughter, the, child, was, adopted, as, a, foundling, from, the, nile, and, grew, up, with, the, egyptian, royal, family, after, killing, an, egyptian, slave, master, who, was, beating, a, hebrew, moses, fled, across, the, red, sea, to, midian, where, he, encountered, the, angel, of, the, lord, speaking, to, him, from, within, a, burning, bush, on, mount, horeb, which, he, regarded, as, the, mountain, of, god, god, sent, moses, back, to, egypt, to, demand, the, release, of, the, israelites, from, slavery, moses, said, that, he, could, not, speak, eloquently, so, god, allowed, aaron, his, elder, brother, to, become, his, spokesperson, after, the, ten, plagues, moses, led, the, exodus, of, the, israelites, out, of, egypt, and, across, the, red, sea, after, which, they, based, themselves, at, mount, sinai, where, moses, received, the, ten, commandments, after, 40, years, of, wandering, in, the, desert, moses, died, on, mount, nebo, at, the, age, of, 120, within, sight, of, the, promised, land, the, majority, of, scholars, see, the, biblical, moses, as, a, legendary, figure, while, retaining, the, possibility, that, moses, or, a, moses, like, figure, existed, in, the, 13th, century, bce, rabbinical, judaism, calculated, a, lifespan, of, moses, corresponding, to, 1391, 1271, bce, jerome, suggested, 1592, bce, and, james, ussher, suggested, 1571, bce, as, his, birth, year, the, egyptian, name, moses, is, mentioned, in, ancient, egyptian, literature, in, the, writing, of, jewish, historian, josephus, ancient, egyptian, historian, manetho, is, quoted, writing, of, a, treasonous, ancient, egyptian, priest, osarseph, who, renamed, himself, moses, and, led, a, successful, coup, against, the, presiding, pharaoh, subsequently, ruling, egypt, for, years, until, the, pharaoh, regained, power, and, expelled, osarseph, and, his, supporters, moses, has, often, been, portrayed, in, christian, art, and, literature, for, instance, in, michelangelo, s, moses, and, in, works, at, a, number, of, us, government, buildings, in, the, medieval, and, renaissance, period, he, is, frequently, shown, as, having, small, horns, as, the, result, of, a, mistranslation, in, the, latin, vulgate, bible, which, nevertheless, at, times, could, reflect, christian, ambivalence, or, have, overtly, antisemitic, connotations, the, egyptian, root, msy, child, of, or, mose, has, been, considered, as, a, possible, etymology, arguably, an, abbreviation, of, a, theophoric, name, with, the, god, s, name, omitted, the, suffix, mose, appears, in, egyptian, pharaohs, names, like, thutmose, born, of, thoth, and, ramose, born, of, ra, one, of, the, egyptian, names, of, ramesses, was, ra, mesesu, mari, amon, meaning, born, of, ra, beloved, of, amon, he, was, also, called, usermaatre, setepenre, meaning, keeper, of, light, and, harmony, strong, in, light, elect, of, re, linguist, abraham, yahuda, based, on, the, spelling, given, in, the, tanakh, argues, that, it, combines, water, or, seed, and, pond, expanse, of, water, thus, yielding, the, sense, of, child, of, the, nile, mw, the, biblical, account, of, moses, birth, provides, him, with, a, folk, etymology, to, explain, the, ostensible, meaning, of, his, name, he, is, said, to, have, received, it, from, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, he, became, her, son, she, named, him, moses, saying, i, drew, him, out, of, the, water, this, explanation, links, it, to, the, semitic, root, m, h, meaning, to, draw, out, the, eleventh, century, tosafist, isaac, b, asher, halevi, noted, that, the, princess, names, him, the, active, participle, drawer, out, m, e, not, the, passive, participle, drawn, out, n, m, e, in, effect, prophesying, that, moses, would, draw, others, out, of, egypt, this, has, been, accepted, by, some, scholars, the, hebrew, etymology, in, the, biblical, story, may, reflect, an, attempt, to, cancel, out, traces, of, moses, egyptian, origins, the, egyptian, character, of, his, name, was, recognized, as, such, by, ancient, jewish, writers, like, philo, and, josephus, philo, linked, moses, name, ancient, greek, romanized, m, ys, s, lit, m, us, s, to, the, egyptian, coptic, word, for, water, m, u, in, reference, to, his, finding, in, the, nile, and, the, biblical, folk, etymology, josephus, in, his, antiquities, of, the, jews, claims, that, the, second, element, es, s, meant, those, who, are, saved, the, problem, of, how, an, egyptian, princess, who, according, to, the, biblical, account, found, in, the, book, of, exodus, gave, him, the, name, moses, could, have, known, hebrew, puzzled, medieval, jewish, commentators, like, abraham, ibn, ezra, and, hezekiah, ben, manoah, hezekiah, suggested, she, either, converted, to, the, jewish, religion, or, took, a, tip, from, jochebed, moses, mother, the, egyptian, princess, who, named, moses, is, not, named, in, the, book, of, exodus, however, she, was, known, to, josephus, as, thermutis, identified, as, tharmuth, and, some, within, jewish, tradition, have, tried, to, identify, her, with, a, daughter, of, pharaoh, in, 1, chronicles, 4, 17, named, bithiah, but, others, note, that, this, is, unlikely, since, there, is, no, textual, indication, that, this, daughter, of, pharaoh, is, the, same, one, who, named, moses, ibn, ezra, gave, two, possibilities, for, the, name, of, moses, he, believed, that, it, was, either, a, translation, of, the, egyptian, name, instead, of, a, transliteration, or, that, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, was, able, to, speak, hebrew, kenneth, kitchen, argues, that, the, hebrew, etymology, is, most, likely, correct, as, the, sounds, in, the, hebrew, m, h, do, not, correspond, to, the, pronunciation, of, egyptian, msy, in, the, relevant, time, period, the, israelites, had, settled, in, the, land, of, goshen, in, the, time, of, joseph, and, jacob, but, a, new, pharaoh, arose, who, oppressed, the, children, of, israel, at, this, time, moses, was, born, to, his, father, amram, son, or, descendant, of, kehath, the, levite, who, entered, egypt, with, jacob, s, household, his, mother, was, jochebed, also, yocheved, who, was, kin, to, kehath, moses, had, one, older, by, seven, years, sister, miriam, and, one, older, by, three, years, brother, aaron, pharaoh, had, commanded, that, all, male, hebrew, children, born, would, be, drowned, in, the, river, nile, but, moses, mother, placed, him, in, an, ark, and, concealed, the, ark, in, the, bulrushes, by, the, riverbank, where, the, baby, was, discovered, and, adopted, by, pharaoh, s, daughter, and, raised, as, an, egyptian, one, day, after, moses, had, reached, adulthood, he, killed, an, egyptian, who, was, beating, a, hebrew, moses, in, order, to, escape, pharaoh, s, death, penalty, fled, to, midian, a, desert, country, south, of, judah, where, he, married, zipporah, there, on, mount, horeb, god, appeared, to, moses, as, a, burning, bush, revealed, to, moses, his, name, yhwh, probably, pronounced, yahweh, and, commanded, him, to, return, to, egypt, and, bring, his, chosen, people, israel, out, of, bondage, and, into, the, promised, land, canaan, during, the, journey, god, tried, to, kill, moses, for, failing, to, circumcise, his, son, but, zipporah, saved, his, life, moses, returned, to, carry, out, god, s, command, but, god, caused, the, pharaoh, to, refuse, and, only, after, god, had, subjected, egypt, to, ten, plagues, did, pharaoh, relent, moses, led, the, israelites, to, the, border, of, egypt, but, their, god, hardened, the, pharaoh, s, heart, once, more, so, that, he, could, destroy, pharaoh, and, his, army, at, the, red, sea, crossing, as, a, sign, of, his, power, to, israel, and, the, nations, after, defeating, the, amalekites, in, rephidim, moses, led, the, israelites, to, mount, sinai, where, he, was, given, the, ten, commandments, from, god, written, on, stone, tablets, however, since, moses, remained, a, long, time, on, the, mountain, some, of, the, people, feared, that, he, might, be, dead, so, they, made, a, statue, of, a, golden, calf, and, worshipped, it, thus, disobeying, and, angering, god, and, moses, moses, out, of, anger, broke, the, tablets, and, later, ordered, the, elimination, of, those, who, had, worshiped, the, golden, statue, which, was, melted, down, and, fed, to, the, idolaters, god, again, wrote, the, ten, commandments, on, a, new, set, of, tablets, later, at, mount, sinai, moses, and, the, elders, entered, into, a, covenant, by, which, israel, would, become, the, people, of, yhwh, obeying, his, laws, and, yhwh, would, be, their, god, moses, delivered, the, laws, of, god, to, israel, instituted, the, priesthood, under, the, sons, of, moses, brother, aaron, and, destroyed, those, israelites, who, fell, away, from, his, worship, in, his, final, act, at, sinai, god, gave, moses, instructions, for, the, tabernacle, the, mobile, shrine, by, which, he, would, travel, with, israel, to, the, promised, land, from, sinai, moses, led, the, israelites, to, the, desert, of, paran, on, the, border, of, canaan, from, there, he, sent, twelve, spies, into, the, land, the, spies, returned, with, samples, of, the, land, s, fertility, but, warned, that, its, inhabitants, were, giants, the, people, were, afraid, and, wanted, to, return, to, egypt, and, some, rebelled, against, moses, and, against, god, moses, told, the, israelites, that, they, were, not, worthy, to, inherit, the, land, and, would, wander, the, wilderness, for, forty, years, until, the, generation, who, had, refused, to, enter, canaan, had, died, so, that, it, would, be, their, children, who, would, possess, the, land, later, on, korah, was, punished, for, leading, a, revolt, against, moses, when, the, forty, years, had, passed, moses, led, the, israelites, east, around, the, dead, sea, to, the, territories, of, edom, and, moab, there, they, escaped, the, temptation, of, idolatry, conquered, the, lands, of, og, and, sihon, in, transjordan, received, god, s, blessing, through, balaam, the, prophet, and, massacred, the, midianites, who, by, the, end, of, the, exodus, journey, had, become, the, enemies, of, the, israelites, due, to, their, notorious, role, in, enticing, the, israelites, to, sin, against, god, moses, was, twice, given, notice, that, he, would, die, before, entry, to, the, promised, land, in, numbers, 27, 13, once, he, had, seen, the, promised, land, from, a, viewpoint, on, mount, abarim, and, again, in, numbers, 31, 1, once, battle, with, the, midianites, had, been, won, on, the, banks, of, the, jordan, river, in, sight, of, the, land, moses, assembled, the, tribes, after, recalling, their, wanderings, he, delivered, god, s, laws, by, which, they, must, live, in, the, land, sang, a, song, of, praise, and, pronounced, a, blessing, on, the, people, and, passed, his, authority, to, joshua, under, whom, they, would, possess, the, land, moses, then, went, up, mount, nebo, looked, over, the, promised, land, spread, out, before, him, and, died, at, the, age, of, one, hundred, and, twenty, so, moses, the, servant, of, the, lord, died, there, in, the, land, of, moab, according, to, the, word, of, the, lord, and, he, buried, him, in, the, valley, in, the, land, of, moab, opposite, beth, peor, but, no, man, knows, his, burial, place, to, this, day, deuteronomy, 34, 5, 6, amplified, bible, moses, is, honoured, among, jews, today, as, the, lawgiver, of, israel, and, he, delivers, several, sets, of, laws, in, the, course, of, the, four, books, the, first, is, the, covenant, code, the, terms, of, the, covenant, which, god, offers, to, the, israelites, at, mount, sinai, embedded, in, the, covenant, are, the, decalogue, the, ten, commandments, exodus, 20, 1, 17, and, the, book, of, the, covenant, exodus, 20, 22, 23, 19, the, entire, book, of, leviticus, constitutes, a, second, body, of, law, the, book, of, numbers, begins, with, yet, another, set, and, the, book, of, deuteronomy, another, moses, has, traditionally, been, regarded, as, the, author, of, those, four, books, and, the, book, of, genesis, which, together, comprise, the, torah, the, first, section, of, the, hebrew, bible, scholars, hold, different, opinions, on, the, historicity, of, moses, for, instance, according, to, william, g, dever, the, modern, scholarly, consensus, is, that, the, biblical, person, of, moses, is, largely, mythical, while, also, holding, that, a, moses, like, figure, may, have, existed, somewhere, in, the, southern, transjordan, in, the, mid, late, 13th, century, b, c, and, that, archeology, can, do, nothing, to, prove, or, confirm, either, way, some, scholars, such, as, konrad, schmid, and, jens, schr, ter, consider, moses, a, historical, figure, according, to, solomon, nigosian, there, are, actually, three, prevailing, views, among, biblical, scholars, one, is, that, moses, is, not, a, historical, figure, another, view, strives, to, anchor, the, decisive, role, he, played, in, israelite, religion, and, a, third, that, argues, there, are, elements, of, both, history, and, legend, from, which, these, issues, are, hotly, debated, unresolved, matters, among, scholars, according, to, brian, britt, there, is, divide, amongst, scholars, when, discussing, matters, on, moses, that, threatens, gridlock, according, to, the, official, torah, commentary, for, conservative, judaism, it, is, irrelevant, if, the, historical, moses, existed, calling, him, the, folkloristic, national, hero, jan, assmann, argues, that, it, cannot, be, known, if, moses, ever, lived, because, there, are, no, traces, of, him, outside, tradition, though, the, names, of, moses, and, others, in, the, biblical, narratives, are, egyptian, and, contain, genuine, egyptian, elements, no, extrabiblical, sources, point, clearly, to, moses, no, references, to, moses, appear, in, any, egyptian, sources, prior, to, the, 4th, century, bce, long, after, he, is, believed, to, have, lived, no, contemporary, egyptian, sources, mention, moses, or, the, events, of, exodus, deuteronomy, nor, has, any, archaeological, evidence, been, discovered, in, egypt, or, the, sinai, wilderness, to, support, the, story, in, which, he, is, the, central, figure, david, adams, leeming, states, that, moses, is, a, mythic, hero, and, the, central, figure, in, hebrew, mythology, the, oxford, companion, to, the, bible, states, that, the, historicity, of, moses, is, the, most, reasonable, albeit, not, unbiased, assumption, to, be, made, about, him, as, his, absence, would, leave, a, vacuum, that, cannot, be, explained, away, oxford, biblical, studies, states, that, although, few, modern, scholars, are, willing, to, support, the, traditional, view, that, moses, himself, wrote, the, five, books, of, the, torah, there, are, certainly, those, who, regard, the, leadership, of, moses, as, too, firmly, based, in, israel, s, corporate, memory, to, be, dismissed, as, pious, fiction, the, story, of, moses, discovery, follows, a, familiar, motif, in, ancient, near, eastern, mythological, accounts, of, the, ruler, who, rises, from, humble, origins, for, example, in, the, account, of, the, origin, of, sargon, of, akkad, 23rd, century, bce, my, mother, the, high, priestess, conceived, in, secret, she, bore, me, she, set, me, in, a, basket, of, rushes, with, bitumen, she, sealed, my, lid, she, cast, me, into, the, river, which, rose, over, me, moses, story, like, those, of, the, other, patriarchs, most, likely, had, a, substantial, oral, prehistory, he, is, mentioned, in, the, book, of, jeremiah, and, the, book, of, isaiah, the, earliest, mention, of, him, is, vague, in, the, book, of, hosea, and, his, name, is, apparently, ancient, as, the, tradition, found, in, exodus, gives, it, a, folk, etymology, nevertheless, the, torah, was, completed, by, combining, older, traditional, texts, with, newly, written, ones, isaiah, written, during, the, exile, i, e, in, the, first, half, of, the, 6th, century, bce, testifies, to, tension, between, the, people, of, judah, and, the, returning, post, exilic, jews, the, g, l, stating, that, god, is, the, father, of, israel, and, that, israel, s, history, begins, with, the, exodus, and, not, with, abraham, the, conclusion, to, be, inferred, from, this, and, similar, evidence, e, g, the, book, of, ezra, and, the, book, of, nehemiah, is, that, the, figure, of, moses, and, the, story, of, the, exodus, must, have, been, preeminent, among, the, people, of, judah, at, the, time, of, the, exile, and, after, serving, to, support, their, claims, to, the, land, in, opposition, to, those, of, the, returning, exiles, a, theory, developed, by, cornelis, tiele, in, 1872, which, has, proved, influential, argued, that, yahweh, was, a, midianite, god, introduced, to, the, israelites, by, moses, whose, father, in, law, jethro, was, a, midianite, priest, it, was, to, such, a, moses, that, yahweh, reveals, his, real, name, hidden, from, the, patriarchs, who, knew, him, only, as, el, shaddai, against, this, view, is, the, modern, consensus, that, most, of, the, israelites, were, native, to, palestine, martin, noth, argued, that, the, pentateuch, uses, the, figure, of, moses, originally, linked, to, legends, of, a, transjordan, conquest, as, a, narrative, bracket, or, late, redactional, device, to, weld, together, four, of, the, five, originally, independent, themes, of, that, work, manfred, g, rg, and, rolf, krauss, the, latter, in, a, somewhat, sensationalist, manner, have, suggested, that, the, moses, story, is, a, distortion, or, transmogrification, of, the, historical, pharaoh, amenmose, c, 1200, bce, who, was, dismissed, from, office, and, whose, name, was, later, simplified, to, msy, mose, aidan, dodson, regards, this, hypothesis, as, intriguing, but, beyond, proof, rudolf, smend, argues, that, the, two, details, about, moses, that, were, most, likely, to, be, historical, are, his, name, of, egyptian, origin, and, his, marriage, to, a, midianite, woman, details, which, seem, unlikely, to, have, been, invented, by, the, israelites, in, smend, s, view, all, other, details, given, in, the, biblical, narrative, are, too, mythically, charged, to, be, seen, as, accurate, data, the, name, king, mesha, of, moab, has, been, linked, to, that, of, moses, mesha, also, is, associated, with, narratives, of, an, exodus, and, a, conquest, and, several, motifs, in, stories, about, him, are, shared, with, the, exodus, tale, and, that, regarding, israel, s, war, with, moab, 2, kings, 3, moab, rebels, against, oppression, like, moses, leads, his, people, out, of, israel, as, moses, does, from, egypt, and, his, first, born, son, is, slaughtered, at, the, wall, of, kir, hareseth, as, the, firstborn, of, israel, are, condemned, to, slaughter, in, the, exodus, story, in, what, calvinist, theologian, peter, leithart, described, as, an, infernal, passover, that, delivers, mesha, while, wrath, burns, against, his, enemies, an, egyptian, version, of, the, tale, that, crosses, over, with, the, moses, story, is, found, in, manetho, who, according, to, the, summary, in, josephus, wrote, that, a, certain, osarseph, a, heliopolitan, priest, became, overseer, of, a, band, of, lepers, when, amenophis, following, indications, by, amenhotep, son, of, hapu, had, all, the, lepers, in, egypt, quarantined, in, order, to, cleanse, the, land, so, that, he, might, see, the, gods, the, lepers, are, bundled, into, avaris, the, former, capital, of, the, hyksos, where, osarseph, prescribes, for, them, everything, forbidden, in, egypt, while, proscribing, everything, permitted, in, egypt, they, invite, the, hyksos, to, reinvade, egypt, rule, with, them, for, 13, years, osarseph, then, assumes, the, name, moses, and, are, then, driven, out, other, egyptian, figures, which, have, been, postulated, as, candidates, for, a, historical, moses, like, figure, include, the, princes, ahmose, ankh, and, ramose, who, were, sons, of, pharaoh, ahmose, i, or, a, figure, associated, with, the, family, of, pharaoh, thutmose, iii, israel, knohl, has, proposed, to, identify, moses, with, irsu, a, shasu, who, according, to, papyrus, harris, i, and, the, elephantine, stele, took, power, in, egypt, with, the, support, of, asiatics, people, from, the, levant, after, the, death, of, queen, twosret, after, coming, to, power, irsu, and, his, supporters, disrupted, egyptian, rituals, treating, the, gods, like, the, people, and, halting, offerings, to, the, egyptian, deities, they, were, eventually, defeated, and, expelled, by, the, new, pharaoh, setnakhte, and, while, fleeing, they, abandoned, large, quantities, of, gold, and, silver, they, had, stolen, from, the, temples, non, biblical, writings, about, jews, with, references, to, the, role, of, moses, first, appear, at, the, beginning, of, the, hellenistic, period, from, 323, bce, to, about, 146, bce, shmuel, notes, that, a, characteristic, of, this, literature, is, the, high, honour, in, which, it, holds, the, peoples, of, the, east, in, general, and, some, specific, groups, among, these, peoples, in, addition, to, the, judeo, roman, or, judeo, hellenic, historians, artapanus, eupolemus, josephus, and, philo, a, few, non, jewish, historians, including, hecataeus, of, abdera, quoted, by, diodorus, siculus, alexander, polyhistor, manetho, apion, chaeremon, of, alexandria, tacitus, and, porphyry, also, make, reference, to, him, the, extent, to, which, any, of, these, accounts, rely, on, earlier, sources, is, unknown, moses, also, appears, in, other, religious, texts, such, as, the, mishnah, c, 200, ce, and, the, midrash, 200, 1200, ce, the, figure, of, osarseph, in, hellenistic, historiography, is, a, renegade, egyptian, priest, who, leads, an, army, of, lepers, against, the, pharaoh, and, is, finally, expelled, from, egypt, changing, his, name, to, moses, the, earliest, existing, reference, to, moses, in, greek, literature, occurs, in, the, egyptian, history, of, hecataeus, of, abdera, 4th, century, bce, all, that, remains, of, his, description, of, moses, are, two, references, made, by, diodorus, siculus, wherein, writes, historian, arthur, droge, he, describes, moses, as, a, wise, and, courageous, leader, who, left, egypt, and, colonized, judaea, among, the, many, accomplishments, described, by, hecataeus, moses, had, founded, cities, established, a, temple, and, religious, cult, and, issued, laws, after, the, establishment, of, settled, life, in, egypt, in, early, times, which, took, place, according, to, the, mythical, account, in, the, period, of, the, gods, and, heroes, the, first, to, persuade, the, multitudes, to, use, written, laws, was, mneves, a, man, not, only, great, of, soul, but, also, in, his, life, the, most, public, spirited, of, all, lawgivers, whose, names, are, recorded, droge, also, points, out, that, this, statement, by, hecataeus, was, similar, to, statements, made, subsequently, by, eupolemus, the, jewish, historian, artapanus, of, alexandria, 2nd, century, bce, portrayed, moses, as, a, cultural, hero, alien, to, the, pharaonic, court, according, to, theologian, john, barclay, the, moses, of, artapanus, clearly, bears, the, destiny, of, the, jews, and, in, his, personal, cultural, and, military, splendor, brings, credit, to, the, whole, jewish, people, jealousy, of, moses, excellent, qualities, induced, chenephres, to, send, him, with, unskilled, troops, on, a, military, expedition, to, ethiopia, where, he, won, great, victories, after, having, built, the, city, of, hermopolis, he, taught, the, people, the, value, of, the, ibis, as, a, protection, against, the, serpents, making, the, bird, the, sacred, guardian, spirit, of, the, city, then, he, introduced, circumcision, after, his, return, to, memphis, moses, taught, the, people, the, value, of, oxen, for, agriculture, and, the, consecration, of, the, same, by, moses, gave, rise, to, the, cult, of, apis, finally, after, having, escaped, another, plot, by, killing, the, assailant, sent, by, the, king, moses, fled, to, arabia, where, he, married, the, daughter, of, raguel, the, ruler, of, the, district, artapanus, goes, on, to, relate, how, moses, returns, to, egypt, with, aaron, and, is, imprisoned, but, miraculously, escapes, through, the, name, of, yhwh, in, order, to, lead, the, exodus, this, account, further, testifies, that, all, egyptian, temples, of, isis, thereafter, contained, a, rod, in, remembrance, of, that, used, for, moses, miracles, he, describes, moses, as, 80, years, old, tall, and, ruddy, with, long, white, hair, and, dignified, some, historians, however, point, out, the, apologetic, nature, of, much, of, artapanus, work, with, his, addition, of, extra, biblical, details, such, as, his, references, to, jethro, the, non, jewish, jethro, expresses, admiration, for, moses, gallantry, in, helping, his, daughters, and, chooses, to, adopt, moses, as, his, son, strabo, a, greek, historian, geographer, and, philosopher, in, his, geographica, c, 24, ce, wrote, in, detail, about, moses, whom, he, considered, to, be, an, egyptian, who, deplored, the, situation, in, his, homeland, and, thereby, attracted, many, followers, who, respected, the, deity, he, writes, for, example, that, moses, opposed, the, picturing, of, the, deity, in, the, form, of, man, or, animal, and, was, convinced, that, the, deity, was, an, entity, which, encompassed, everything, land, and, sea, 35, an, egyptian, priest, named, moses, who, possessed, a, portion, of, the, country, called, the, lower, egypt, being, dissatisfied, with, the, established, institutions, there, left, it, and, came, to, judaea, with, a, large, body, of, people, who, worshipped, the, divinity, he, declared, and, taught, that, the, egyptians, and, africans, entertained, erroneous, sentiments, in, representing, the, divinity, under, the, likeness, of, wild, beasts, and, cattle, of, the, field, that, the, greeks, also, were, in, error, in, making, images, of, their, gods, after, the, human, form, for, god, may, be, this, one, thing, which, encompasses, us, all, land, and, sea, which, we, call, heaven, or, the, universe, or, the, nature, of, things, 36, by, such, doctrine, moses, persuaded, a, large, body, of, right, minded, persons, to, accompany, him, to, the, place, where, jerusalem, now, stands, in, strabo, s, writings, of, the, history, of, judaism, as, he, understood, it, he, describes, various, stages, in, its, development, from, the, first, stage, including, moses, and, his, direct, heirs, to, the, final, stage, where, the, temple, of, jerusalem, continued, to, be, surrounded, by, an, aura, of, sanctity, strabo, s, positive, and, unequivocal, appreciation, of, moses, personality, is, among, the, most, sympathetic, in, all, ancient, literature, his, portrayal, of, moses, is, said, to, be, similar, to, the, writing, of, hecataeus, who, described, moses, as, a, man, who, excelled, in, wisdom, and, courage, egyptologist, jan, assmann, concludes, that, strabo, was, the, historian, who, came, closest, to, a, construction, of, moses, religion, as, monotheistic, and, as, a, pronounced, counter, religion, it, recognized, only, one, divine, being, whom, no, image, can, represent, the, only, way, to, approach, this, god, is, to, live, in, virtue, and, in, justice, the, roman, historian, tacitus, c, 56, 120, ce, refers, to, moses, by, noting, that, the, jewish, religion, was, monotheistic, and, without, a, clear, image, his, primary, work, wherein, he, describes, jewish, philosophy, is, his, histories, c, 100, where, according, to, 18th, century, translator, and, irish, dramatist, arthur, murphy, as, a, result, of, the, jewish, worship, of, one, god, pagan, mythology, fell, into, contempt, tacitus, states, that, despite, various, opinions, current, in, his, day, regarding, the, jews, ethnicity, most, of, his, sources, are, in, agreement, that, there, was, an, exodus, from, egypt, by, his, account, the, pharaoh, bocchoris, suffering, from, a, plague, banished, the, jews, in, response, to, an, oracle, of, the, god, zeus, amun, a, motley, crowd, was, thus, collected, and, abandoned, in, the, desert, while, all, the, other, outcasts, lay, idly, lamenting, one, of, them, named, moses, advised, them, not, to, look, for, help, to, gods, or, men, since, both, had, deserted, them, but, to, trust, rather, in, themselves, and, accept, as, divine, the, guidance, of, the, first, being, by, whose, aid, they, should, get, out, of, their, present, plight, in, this, version, moses, and, the, jews, wander, through, the, desert, for, only, six, days, capturing, the, holy, land, on, the, seventh, the, septuagint, the, greek, version, of, the, hebrew, bible, impressed, the, pagan, author, of, the, famous, classical, book, of, literary, criticism, on, the, sublime, traditionally, attributed, to, longinus, the, date, of, composition, is, unknown, but, it, is, commonly, assigned, to, the, late, 1st, century, c, e, the, writer, quotes, genesis, in, a, style, which, presents, the, nature, of, the, deity, in, a, manner, suitable, to, his, pure, and, great, being, but, he, does, not, mention, moses, by, name, calling, him, no, chance, person, but, the, lawgiver, thesmothete, of, the, jews, a, term, that, puts, him, on, a, par, with, lycurgus, and, minos, aside, from, a, reference, to, cicero, moses, is, the, only, non, greek, writer, quoted, in, the, work, contextually, he, is, put, on, a, par, with, homer, and, he, is, described, with, far, more, admiration, than, even, greek, writers, who, treated, moses, with, respect, such, as, hecataeus, and, strabo, in, josephus, 37, c, 100, ce, antiquities, of, the, jews, moses, is, mentioned, throughout, for, example, book, viii, ch, iv, describes, solomon, s, temple, also, known, as, the, first, temple, at, the, time, the, ark, of, the, covenant, was, first, moved, into, the, newly, built, temple, when, king, solomon, had, finished, these, works, these, large, and, beautiful, buildings, and, had, laid, up, his, donations, in, the, temple, and, all, this, in, the, interval, of, seven, years, and, had, given, a, demonstration, of, his, riches, and, alacrity, therein, he, also, wrote, to, the, rulers, and, elders, of, the, hebrews, and, ordered, all, the, people, to, gather, themselves, together, to, jerusalem, both, to, see, the, temple, which, he, had, built, and, to, remove, the, ark, of, god, into, it, and, when, this, invitation, of, the, whole, body, of, the, people, to, come, to, jerusalem, was, everywhere, carried, abroad, the, feast, of, tabernacles, happened, to, fall, at, the, same, time, which, was, kept, by, the, hebrews, as, a, most, holy, and, most, eminent, feast, so, they, carried, the, ark, and, the, tabernacle, which, moses, had, pitched, and, all, the, vessels, that, were, for, ministration, to, the, sacrifices, of, god, and, removed, them, to, the, temple, now, the, ark, contained, nothing, else, but, those, two, tables, of, stone, that, preserved, the, ten, commandments, which, god, spake, to, moses, in, mount, sinai, and, which, were, engraved, upon, them, according, to, feldman, josephus, also, attaches, particular, significance, to, moses, possession, of, the, cardinal, virtues, of, wisdom, courage, temperance, and, justice, he, also, includes, piety, as, an, added, fifth, virtue, in, addition, he, stresses, moses, willingness, to, undergo, toil, and, his, careful, avoidance, of, bribery, like, plato, s, philosopher, king, moses, excels, as, an, educator, numenius, a, greek, philosopher, who, was, a, native, of, apamea, in, syria, wrote, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 2nd, century, ce, historian, kennieth, guthrie, writes, that, numenius, is, perhaps, the, only, recognized, greek, philosopher, who, explicitly, studied, moses, the, prophets, and, the, life, of, jesus, he, describes, his, background, numenius, was, a, man, of, the, world, he, was, not, limited, to, greek, and, egyptian, mysteries, but, talked, familiarly, of, the, myths, of, brahmins, and, magi, it, is, however, his, knowledge, and, use, of, the, hebrew, scriptures, which, distinguished, him, from, other, greek, philosophers, he, refers, to, moses, simply, as, the, prophet, exactly, as, for, him, homer, is, the, poet, plato, is, described, as, a, greek, moses, the, christian, saint, and, religious, philosopher, justin, martyr, 103, 165, ce, drew, the, same, conclusion, as, numenius, according, to, other, experts, theologian, paul, blackham, notes, that, justin, considered, moses, to, be, more, trustworthy, profound, and, truthful, because, he, is, older, than, the, greek, philosophers, he, quotes, him, i, will, begin, then, with, our, first, prophet, and, lawgiver, moses, that, you, may, know, that, of, all, your, teachers, whether, sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or, lawgivers, by, far, the, oldest, as, the, greek, histories, show, us, was, moses, who, was, our, first, religious, teacher, most, of, what, is, known, about, moses, from, the, bible, comes, from, the, books, of, exodus, leviticus, numbers, and, deuteronomy, the, majority, of, scholars, consider, the, compilation, of, these, books, to, go, back, to, the, persian, period, 538, 332, bce, but, based, on, earlier, written, and, oral, traditions, there, is, a, wealth, of, stories, and, additional, information, about, moses, in, the, jewish, apocrypha, and, in, the, genre, of, rabbinical, exegesis, known, as, midrash, as, well, as, in, the, primary, works, of, the, jewish, oral, law, the, mishnah, and, the, talmud, moses, is, also, given, a, number, of, bynames, in, jewish, tradition, the, midrash, identifies, moses, as, one, of, seven, biblical, personalities, who, were, called, by, various, names, moses, other, names, were, jekuthiel, by, his, mother, heber, by, his, father, jered, by, miriam, avi, zanoah, by, aaron, avi, gedor, by, kohath, avi, soco, by, his, wet, nurse, shemaiah, ben, nethanel, by, people, of, israel, moses, is, also, attributed, the, names, toviah, as, a, first, name, and, levi, as, a, family, name, vayikra, rabbah, 1, 3, heman, mechoqeiq, lawgiver, and, ehl, gav, ish, numbers, 12, 3, in, another, exegesis, moses, had, ascended, to, the, first, heaven, until, the, seventh, even, visited, paradise, and, hell, alive, after, he, saw, the, divine, vision, in, mount, horeb, jewish, historians, who, lived, at, alexandria, such, as, eupolemus, attributed, to, moses, the, feat, of, having, taught, the, phoenicians, their, alphabet, similar, to, legends, of, thoth, artapanus, of, alexandria, explicitly, identified, moses, not, only, with, thoth, hermes, but, also, with, the, greek, figure, musaeus, whom, he, called, the, teacher, of, orpheus, and, ascribed, to, him, the, division, of, egypt, into, 36, districts, each, with, its, own, liturgy, he, named, the, princess, who, adopted, moses, as, merris, wife, of, pharaoh, chenephres, jewish, tradition, considers, moses, to, be, the, greatest, prophet, who, ever, lived, despite, his, importance, judaism, stresses, that, moses, was, a, human, being, and, is, therefore, not, to, be, worshipped, only, god, is, worthy, of, worship, in, judaism, to, orthodox, jews, moses, is, called, moshe, rabbenu, eved, hashem, avi, haneviim, zya, a, our, leader, moshe, servant, of, god, father, of, all, the, prophets, may, his, merit, shield, us, amen, in, the, orthodox, view, moses, received, not, only, the, torah, but, also, the, revealed, written, and, oral, and, the, hidden, the, hokhmat, nistar, teachings, which, gave, judaism, the, zohar, of, the, rashbi, the, torah, of, the, ari, haqadosh, and, all, that, is, discussed, in, the, heavenly, yeshiva, between, the, ramhal, and, his, masters, arising, in, part, from, his, age, of, death, 120, years, according, to, deuteronomy, 34, 7, and, that, his, eye, had, not, dimmed, and, his, vigor, had, not, diminished, the, phrase, may, you, live, to, 120, has, become, a, common, blessing, among, jews, 120, is, stated, as, the, maximum, age, for, all, of, noah, s, descendants, in, genesis, 6, 3, moses, is, mentioned, more, often, in, the, new, testament, than, any, other, old, testament, figure, for, christians, moses, is, often, a, symbol, of, god, s, law, as, reinforced, and, expounded, on, in, the, teachings, of, jesus, new, testament, writers, often, compared, jesus, words, and, deeds, with, moses, to, explain, jesus, mission, in, acts, 7, 39, 43, 51, 53, for, example, the, rejection, of, moses, by, the, jews, who, worshipped, the, golden, calf, is, likened, to, the, rejection, of, jesus, by, the, jews, that, continued, in, traditional, judaism, moses, also, figures, in, several, of, jesus, messages, when, he, met, the, pharisee, nicodemus, at, night, in, the, third, chapter, of, the, gospel, of, john, he, compared, moses, lifting, up, of, the, bronze, serpent, in, the, wilderness, which, any, israelite, could, look, at, and, be, healed, to, his, own, lifting, up, by, his, death, and, resurrection, for, the, people, to, look, at, and, be, healed, in, the, sixth, chapter, jesus, responded, to, the, people, s, claim, that, moses, provided, them, manna, in, the, wilderness, by, saying, that, it, was, not, moses, but, god, who, provided, calling, himself, the, bread, of, life, jesus, stated, that, he, was, provided, to, feed, god, s, people, moses, along, with, elijah, is, presented, as, meeting, with, jesus, in, all, three, synoptic, gospels, of, the, transfiguration, of, jesus, in, matthew, 17, mark, 9, and, luke, 9, in, matthew, 23, in, what, is, the, first, attested, use, of, a, phrase, referring, to, this, rabbinical, usage, the, graeco, aramaic, jesus, refers, to, the, scribes, and, the, pharisees, in, a, passage, critical, of, them, as, having, seated, themselves, on, the, chair, of, moses, greek, ep, t, s, m, s, s, kath, dras, his, relevance, to, modern, christianity, has, not, diminished, moses, is, considered, to, be, a, saint, by, several, churches, and, is, commemorated, as, a, prophet, in, the, respective, calendars, of, saints, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, roman, catholic,

a, wonderful, way, jesus, christ, was, condemned, by, herod, and, also, wonderfully, saved, moses, forsook, the, king, s, court, so, as, to, help, his, persecuted, brethren, the, son, of, god, left,

indicating, that, he, was, one, of, those, prophets, who, brought, a, book, and, law, to, his, people, most, of, the, key, events, in, moses, life, which, are, narrated, in, the, bible, are, to, be,

to, the, bah, faith, bah, u, ll, h, the, founder, of, the, faith, is, the, one, who, spoke, to, moses, from, the, burning, bush, abdu, l, bah, has, highlighted, the, fact, that, moses, like, abraham, had, none, of, the, makings, of, a, great, man, of, history, but, through, god, s, assistance, he, was, able, to, achieve, many, great, things, he, is, described, as, having, been, for, a, long, time, a, shepherd, in, the, wilderness, of, having, had, a, stammer, and, of, being, much, hated, and, detested, by, pharaoh, and, the, ancient, egyptians, of, his, time, he, is, said, to, have, been, raised, in, an, oppressive, household, and, to, have, been, known, in, egypt, as, a, man, who, had, committed, murder, though, he, had, done, so, in, order, to, prevent, an, act, of, cruelty, nevertheless, like, abraham, through, the, assistance, of, god, he, achieved, great, things, and, gained, renown, even, beyond, the, levant, chief, among, these, achievements, was, the, freeing, of, his, people, the, hebrews, from, bondage, in, egypt, and, leading, them, to, the, holy, land, he, is, viewed, as, the, one, who, bestowed, on, israel, the, religious, and, the, civil, law, which, gave, them, honour, among, all, nations, and, which, spread, their, fame, to, different, parts, of, the, world, furthermore, through, the, law, moses, is, believed, to, have, led, the, hebrews, to, the, highest, possible, degree, of, civilization, at, that, period, abdul, l, bah, asserts, that, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, regarded, the, illustrious, men, of, israel, as, models, of,

thus, to, the, transcendent, dignity, of, the, human, being, references, to, moses, were, used, by, the, puritans, who, relied, on, the, story, of, moses, to, give, meaning, and, hope, to, the, lives,
