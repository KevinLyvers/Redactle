formation, of, the, universe, however, numerous, cultures, have, stories, that, take, place, after, the, initial, origin, these, stories, aim, to, explain, the, origins, of, natural, phenomena, or, human, institutions, within, an, already, existing, world, in, graeco, roman, scholarship, the, terms, etiological, myth, and, aition, from, the, ancient, greek, cause, are, occasionally, used, to, describe, a, myth, that, clarifies, an, origin, particularly, how, an, object, or, custom, came, into, existence, origin, myths, are, narratives, that, explain, how, a, particular, reality, came, into, existence, they, often, serve, to, justify, the, established, order, by, attributing, its, establishment, to, sacred, forces, see, social, function, the, line, between, cosmogonic, myths, which, describe, the, origin, of, the, world, and, origin, myths, is, not, always, clear, a, myth, about, the, origin, of, a, specific, part, of, the, world, assumes, the, existence, of, the, world, itself, which, often, relies, on, a, cosmogonic, myth, therefore, origin, myths, can, be, seen, as, expanding, upon, and, building, upon, their, cultures, cosmogonic, myths, in, traditional, cultures, it, is, common, for, the, recitation, of, an, origin, myth, to, be, preceded, by, the, recitation, of, a, cosmogonic, myth, within, academic, circles, the, term, myth, is, often, used, specifically, to, refer, to, origin, and, cosmogonic, myths, folklorists, for, example, reserve, the, term, myth, for, stories, that, describe, creation, stories, that, do, not, primarily, focus, on, origins, are, categorized, as, legend, or, folk, tale, which, are, distinct, from, myths, according, to, folklorists, mircea, eliade, a, historian, argues, that, in, many, traditional, cultures, almost, every, sacred, story, can, be, considered, an, origin, myth, traditional, societies, often, pattern, their, behavior, after, sacred, events, and, view, their, lives, as, a, cyclical, return, to, a, mythical, age, as, a, result, nearly, every, sacred, story, portrays, events, that, establish, a, new, framework, for, human, behavior, making, them, essentially, stories, of, creation, an, origin, myth, often, functions, to, justify, the, current, state, of, affairs, in, traditional, cultures, the, entities, and, forces, described, in, origin, myths, are, often, considered, sacred, thus, by, attributing, the, state, of, the, universe, to, the, actions, of, these, entities, and, forces, origin, myths, give, the, current, order, an, aura, of, sacredness, yths, reveal, that, the, world, man, and, life, have, a, supernatural, origin, and, history, and, that, this, history, is, significant, precious, and, exemplary, many, cultures, instil, the, expectation, that, people, take, mythical, gods, and, heroes, as, their, role, models, imitating, their, deeds, and, upholding, the, customs, they, established, when, the, missionary, and, ethnologist, c, strehlow, asked, the, australian, arunta, why, they, performed, certain, ceremonies, the, answer, was, always, because, the, ancestors, so, commanded, it, the, kai, of, new, guinea, refused, to, change, their, way, of, living, and, working, and, they, explained, it, was, thus, that, the, nemu, the, mythical, ancestors, did, and, we, do, likewise, asked, the, reason, for, a, particular, detail, in, a, ceremony, a, navaho, chanter, answered, because, the, holy, people, did, it, that, way, in, the, first, place, we, find, exactly, the, same, justification, in, the, prayer, that, accompanies, a, primitive, tibetan, ritual, as, it, has, been, handed, down, from, the, beginning, of, the, earth, s, creation, so, must, we, sacrifice, as, our, ancestors, in, ancient, times, did, so, do, we, now, founding, myths, unite, people, and, tend, to, include, mystical, events, along, the, way, to, make, founders, seem, more, desirable, and, heroic, ruling, monarchs, or, aristocracies, may, allege, descent, from, mythical, founders, gods, or, heroes, in, order, to, legitimate, their, control, for, example, julius, caesar, and, his, relatives, claimed, aeneas, and, through, aeneas, the, goddess, venus, as, an, ancestor, a, founding, myth,

though, many, stories, are, adapted, from, older, religions, a, founding, myth, may, serve, as, the, primary, exemplum, as, the, myth, of, ixion, was, the, original, greek, example, of, a, murderer, rendered, unclean, by, his, crime, who, needed, cleansing, catharsis, of, his, impurity, founding, myths, feature, prominently, in, greek, mythology, ancient, greek, rituals, were, bound, to,

founding, myths, established, the, special, relationship, between, a, deity, and, local, people, who, traced, their, origins, from, a, hero, and, authenticated, their, ancestral, rights, through, the, founding, myth, greek, founding, myths, often, embody, a, justification, for, the, ancient, overturning, of, an, older, archaic, order, reformulating, a, historical, event, anchored, in, the, social, and, natural, world, to, valorize, current, community, practices, creating, symbolic, narratives, of, collective, importance, enriched, with, metaphor, to, account, for, traditional, chronologies, and, constructing, an, etiology, considered, to, be, plausible, among, those, with, a, cultural, investment, in, the, greek, view, the, mythic, past, had, deep, roots, in, historic, time, its, legends, treated, as, facts, as, carlo, brillante, has, noted, its, heroic, protagonists, seen, as, links, between, the, age, of, origins, and, the, mortal, everyday, world, that, succeeded, it, a, modern, translator, of, apollonius, of, rhodes, argonautica, has, noted, of, the, many, aitia, embedded, as, digressions, in, that, hellenistic, epic, that, crucial, to, social, stability, had, to, be, the, function, of, myths, in, providing, explanations, authorization, or, empowerment, for, the, present, in, terms, of, origins, this, could, apply, not, only, to, foundations, or, charter, myths, and, genealogical, trees, thus, supporting, family, or, territorial, claims, but, also, to, personal, moral, choices, in, the, period, after, alexander, the, great, expanded, the, hellenistic, world, greek, poetry, callimachus, wrote, a, whole, work, simply, titled, aitia, is, replete, with, founding, myths, simon, goldhill, employs, the, metaphor, of, sedimentation, in, describing, apollonius, laying, down, of, layers, where, each, object, cult, ritual, name, may, be, opened, into, a, narrative, of, origination, and, where, each, narrative, each, event, may, lead, to, a, cult, ritual, name, monument, a, notable, example, is, the, myth, of, the, foundation, of, rome, the, tale, of, romulus, and, remus, which, virgil, in, turn, broadens, in, his, aeneid, with, the, odyssey, of, aeneas, and, his, razing, of, lavinium, and, his, son, iulus, s, later, relocation, and, rule, of, the, famous, twins, birthplace, alba, longa, and, their, descent, from, his, royal, line, thus, fitting, perfectly, into, the, already, established, canon, of, events, similarly, the, old, testament, s, story, of, the, exodus, serves, as, the, founding, myth, for, the, community, of, israel, telling, how, god, delivered, the, israelites, from, slavery, and, how, they, therefore, belonged, to, him, through, the, covenant, of, mount, sinai, during, the, middle, ages, founding, myths, of, the, medieval, communes, of, northern, italy, manifested, the, increasing, self, confidence, of, the, urban, population, and, the, will, to, find, a, roman, origin, however, tenuous, and, legendary, in, 13th, century, padua, when, each, commune, looked, for, a, roman, founder, and, if, one, was, not, available, invented, one, a, legend, had, been, current, in, the, city, attributing, its, foundation, to, the, trojan, antenor, larger, than, life, heroes, continue, to, bolster, the, origin, myths, of, many, newer, nations, and, societies, in, modern, era, colonial, contexts, waves, of, individuals, and, groups, come, to, the, fore, in, popular, history, as, shaping, and, exemplifying, the, ideals, of, a, group, explorers, followed, by, conquerors, followed, by, developers, exploiters, note, for, example, the, conquistadors, of, the, iberian, empires, the, bandeirantes, in, brazil, the, coureurs, des, bois, in, canada, the, cossacks, and, the, promyshlenniki, in, siberia, and, in, alaska, the, bands, of, pioneers, in, the, central, and, western, united, states, and, the, voortrekkers, in, southern, africa, foundational, stories, are, accounts, of, the, development, of, cities, and, nations, a, foundational, story, represents, the, view, that, the, creation, of, the, city, is, a, human, achievement, human, control, and, the, removal, of, wild, uncontrolled, nature, is, underlined, there, are, two, versions, of, foundational, stories, civilization, story, and, degradation, story, civilization, stories, take, a, view, of, nature, as, dangerous, and, wild, the, development, of, the, city, is, seen, as, a, successful, distancing, of, humans, from, nature, nature, is, locked, out, and, humans, take, pride, in, doing, so, successfully, in, 1979, the, geographer, yi, fu, tuan, suggested, ranking, cities, according, to, how, far, they, depart, from, farm, life, from, the, agricultural, rhythm, of, peak, activity, in, the, warm, half, of, the, year, and, from, the, cycle, of, work, during, the, day, and, of, sleep, at, night, degradation, stories, also, called, pollution, stories, take, a, different, stance, the, city, is, seen, as, spoiling, the, landscape, of, the, ecological, relations, that, existed, before, the, city, was, established, there, is, a, sense, of, guilt, for, degrading, the, intact, system, of, nature, in, degradation, stories, true, nature, only, exists, outside, the, city
