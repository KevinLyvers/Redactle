athena, or, athene, often, given, the, epithet, pallas, is, an, ancient, greek, goddess, associated, with, wisdom, warfare, and, handicraft, who, was, later, syncretized, with, the, roman, goddess, minerva, athena, was, regarded, as, the, patron, and, protectress, of, various, cities, across, greece, particularly, the, city, of, athens, from, which, she, most, likely, received, her, name, the, parthenon, on, the, acropolis, of, athens, is, dedicated, to, her, her, major, symbols, include, owls, olive, trees, snakes, and, the, gorgoneion, in, art, she, is, generally, depicted, wearing, a, helmet, and, holding, a, spear, from, her, origin, as, an, aegean, palace, goddess, athena, was, closely, associated, with, the, city, she, was, known, as, polias, and, poliouchos, both, derived, from, polis, meaning, city, state, and, her, temples, were, usually, located, atop, the, fortified, acropolis, in, the, central, part, of, the, city, the, parthenon, on, the, athenian, acropolis, is, dedicated, to, her, along, with, numerous, other, temples, and, monuments, as, the, patron, of, craft, and, weaving, athena, was, known, as, ergane, she, was, also, a, warrior, goddess, and, was, believed, to, lead, soldiers, into, battle, as, athena, promachos, her, main, festival, in, athens, was, the, panathenaia, which, was, celebrated, during, the, month, of, hekatombaion, in, midsummer, and, was, the, most, important, festival, on, the, athenian, calendar, in, greek, mythology, athena, was, believed, to, have, been, born, from, the, forehead, of, her, father, zeus, in, some, versions, of, the, story, athena, has, no, mother, and, is, born, from, zeus, forehead, by, parthenogenesis, in, others, such, as, hesiod, s, theogony, zeus, swallows, his, consort, metis, who, was, pregnant, with, athena, in, this, version, athena, is, first, born, within, zeus, and, then, escapes, from, his, body, through, his, forehead, in, the, founding, myth, of, athens, athena, bested, poseidon, in, a, competition, over, patronage, of, the, city, by, creating, the, first, olive, tree, she, was, known, as, athena, parthenos, athena, the, virgin, in, one, archaic, attic, myth, the, god, hephaestus, tried, and, failed, to, rape, her, resulting, in, gaia, giving, birth, to, erichthonius, an, important, athenian, founding, hero, athena, was, the, patron, goddess, of, heroic, endeavor, she, was, believed, to, have, aided, the, heroes, perseus, heracles, bellerophon, and, jason, along, with, aphrodite, and, hera, athena, was, one, of, the, three, goddesses, whose, feud, resulted, in, the, beginning, of, the, trojan, war, she, plays, an, active, role, in, the, iliad, in, which, she, assists, the, achaeans, and, in, the, odyssey, she, is, the, divine, counselor, to, odysseus, in, the, later, writings, of, the, roman, poet, ovid, athena, was, said, to, have, competed, against, the, mortal, arachne, in, a, weaving, competition, afterward, transforming, arachne, into, the, first, spider, ovid, also, describes, how, athena, transformed, her, priestess, medusa, and, the, latter, s, sisters, stheno, and, euryale, into, the, gorgons, after, witnessing, the, young, woman, being, raped, by, poseidon, in, the, goddess, s, temple, since, the, renaissance, athena, has, become, an, international, symbol, of, wisdom, the, arts, and, classical, learning, western, artists, and, allegorists, have, often, used, athena, as, a, symbol, of, freedom, and, democracy, athena, is, associated, with, the, city, of, athens, the, name, of, the, city, in, ancient, greek, is, ath, nai, a, plural, toponym, designating, the, place, where, according, to, myth, she, presided, over, the, athenai, a, sisterhood, devoted, to, her, worship, in, ancient, times, scholars, argued, whether, athena, was, named, after, athens, or, athens, after, athena, now, scholars, generally, agree, that, the, goddess, takes, her, name, from, the, city, the, ending, ene, is, common, in, names, of, locations, but, rare, for, personal, names, testimonies, from, different, cities, in, ancient, greece, attest, that, similar, city, goddesses, were, worshipped, in, other, cities, and, like, athena, took, their, names, from, the, cities, where, they, were, worshipped, for, example, in, mycenae, there, was, a, goddess, called, mykene, whose, sisterhood, was, known, as, mykenai, whereas, at, thebes, an, analogous, deity, was, called, thebe, and, the, city, was, known, under, the, plural, form, thebai, or, thebes, in, english, where, the, s, is, the, plural, formation, the, name, athenai, is, likely, of, pre, greek, origin, because, it, contains, the, presumably, pre, greek, morpheme, n, in, his, dialogue, cratylus, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, plato, 428, 347, bc, gives, some, rather, imaginative, etymologies, of, athena, s, name, based, on, the, theories, of, the, ancient, athenians, and, his, etymological, speculations, that, is, a, graver, matter, and, there, my, friend, the, modern, interpreters, of, homer, may, i, think, assist, in, explaining, the, view, of, the, ancients, most, of, these, in, their, explanations, of, the, poet, assert, that, he, meant, by, athena, mind, and, intelligence, and, the, maker, of, names, appears, to, have, had, a, singular, notion, about, her, and, indeed, calls, her, by, a, still, higher, title, divine, intelligence, as, though, he, would, say, this, is, she, who, has, the, mind, of, god, perhaps, however, the, name, theonoe, may, mean, she, who, knows, divine, things, better, than, others, nor, shall, we, be, far, wrong, in, supposing, that, the, author, of, it, wished, to, identify, this, goddess, with, moral, intelligence, and, therefore, gave, her, the, name, etheonoe, which, however, either, he, or, his, successors, have, altered, into, what, they, thought, a, nicer, form, and, called, her, athena, thus, plato, believed, that, athena, s, name, was, derived, from, greek, atheon, a, which, the, later, greeks, rationalised, as, from, the, deity, s, the, s, mind, no, s, the, second, century, ad, orator, aelius, aristides, attempted, to, derive, natural, symbols, from, the, etymological, roots, of, athena, s, names, to, be, aether, air, earth, and, moon, athena, was, originally, the, aegean, goddess, of, the, palace, who, presided, over, household, crafts, and, protected, the, king, a, single, mycenaean, greek, inscription, a, ta, na, po, ti, ni, ja, appears, at, knossos, in, the, linear, b, tablets, from, the, late, minoan, ii, era, room, of, the, chariot, tablets, these, comprise, the, earliest, linear, b, archive, anywhere, although, athana, potnia, is, often, translated, as, mistress, athena, it, could, also, mean, the, potnia, of, athana, or, the, lady, of, athens, however, any, connection, to, the, city, of, athens, in, the, knossos, inscription, is, uncertain, a, sign, series, a, ta, no, dju, wa, ja, appears, in, the, still, undeciphered, corpus, of, linear, a, tablets, written, in, the, unclassified, minoan, language, this, could, be, connected, with, the, linear, b, mycenaean, expressions, a, ta, na, po, ti, ni, ja, and, di, u, ja, or, di, wi, ja, diwia, of, zeus, or, possibly, related, to, a, homonymous, goddess, resulting, in, a, translation, athena, of, zeus, or, divine, athena, similarly, in, the, greek, mythology, and, epic, tradition, athena, figures, as, a, daughter, of, zeus, cfr, dyeus, however, the, inscription, quoted, seems, to, be, very, similar, to, a, ta, n, t, wa, ya, quoted, as, sy, za, 1, by, jan, best, best, translates, the, initial, a, ta, n, t, which, is, recurrent, in, line, beginnings, as, i, have, given, a, mycenean, fresco, depicts, two, women, extending, their, hands, towards, a, central, figure, who, is, covered, by, an, enormous, figure, eight, shield, this, may, depict, the, warrior, goddess, with, her, palladium, or, her, palladium, in, an, aniconic, representation, in, the, procession, fresco, at, knossos, which, was, reconstructed, by, the, mycenaeans, two, rows, of, figures, carrying, vessels, seem, to, meet, in, front, of, a, central, figure, which, is, probably, the, minoan, precursor, to, athena, the, early, twentieth, century, scholar, martin, persson, nilsson, argued, that, the, minoan, snake, goddess, figurines, are, early, representations, of, athena, nilsson, and, others, have, claimed, that, in, early, times, athena, was, either, an, owl, herself, or, a, bird, goddess, in, general, in, the, third, book, of, the, odyssey, she, takes, the, form, of, a, sea, eagle, proponents, of, this, view, argue, that, she, dropped, her, prophylactic, owl, mask, before, she, lost, her, wings, athena, by, the, time, she, appears, in, art, jane, ellen, harrison, remarks, has, completely, shed, her, animal, form, has, reduced, the, shapes, she, once, wore, of, snake, and, bird, to, attributes, but, occasionally, in, black, figure, vase, paintings, she, still, appears, with, wings, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, cult, of, athena, preserves, some, aspects, of, the, proto, indo, european, transfunctional, goddess, the, cult, of, athena, may, have, also, been, influenced, by, those, of, near, eastern, warrior, goddesses, such, as, the, east, semitic, ishtar, and, the, ugaritic, anat, both, of, whom, were, often, portrayed, bearing, arms, classical, scholar, charles, penglase, notes, that, athena, resembles, inanna, in, her, role, as, a, terrifying, warrior, goddess, and, that, both, goddesses, were, closely, linked, with, creation, athena, s, birth, from, the, head, of, zeus, may, be, derived, from, the, earlier, sumerian, myth, of, inanna, s, descent, into, and, return, from, the, underworld, plato, notes, that, the, citizens, of, sais, in, egypt, worshipped, a, goddess, known, as, neith, whom, he, identifies, with, athena, neith, was, the, ancient, egyptian, goddess, of, war, and, hunting, who, was, also, associated, with, weaving, her, worship, began, during, the, egyptian, pre, dynastic, period, in, greek, mythology, athena, was, reported, to, have, visited, mythological, sites, in, north, africa, including, libya, s, triton, river, and, the, phlegraean, plain, based, on, these, similarities, the, sinologist, martin, bernal, created, the, black, athena, hypothesis, which, claimed, that, neith, was, brought, to, greece, from, egypt, along, with, an, enormous, number, of, features, of, civilization, and, culture, in, the, third, and, second, millennia, the, black, athena, hypothesis, stirred, up, widespread, controversy, near, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, but, it, has, now, been, widely, rejected, by, modern, scholars, athena, was, also, the, goddess, of, peace, in, a, similar, manner, to, her, patronage, of, various, activities, and, greek, cities, athena, was, thought, to, be, a, protector, of, heroes, and, a, patron, of, art, and, various, local, traditions, related, to, the, arts, and, handicrafts, athena, was, known, as, atrytone, the, unwearying, parthenos, virgin, and, promachos, she, who, fights, in, front, the, epithet, polias, of, the, city, refers, to, athena, s, role, as, protectress, of, the, city, the, epithet, ergane, the, industrious, pointed, her, out, as, the, patron, of, craftsmen, and, artisans, burkert, notes, that, the, athenians, sometimes, simply, called, athena, the, goddess, h, the, s, certainly, an, ancient, title, after, serving, as, the, judge, at, the, trial, of, orestes, in, which, he, was, acquitted, of, having, murdered, his, mother, clytemnestra, athena, won, the, epithet, areia, some, have, described, athena, along, with, the, goddesses, hestia, and, artemis, as, being, asexual, this, is, mainly, supported, by, the, fact, that, in, the, homeric, hymns, 5, to, aphrodite, where, aphrodite, is, described, as, having, no, power, over, the, three, goddesses, athena, was, sometimes, given, the, epithet, hippia, of, the, horses, equestrian, referring, to, her, invention, of, the, bit, bridle, chariot, and, wagon, the, greek, geographer, pausanias, mentions, in, his, guide, to, greece, that, the, temple, of, athena, chalinitis, the, bridler, in, corinth, was, located, near, the, tomb, of, medea, s, children, other, epithets, include, ageleia, itonia, and, aethyia, under, which, she, was, worshiped, in, megara, she, was, worshipped, as, assesia, in, assesos, the, word, a, thyia, signifies, a, diver, also, some, diving, bird, species, possibly, the, shearwater, and, figuratively, a, ship, so, the, name, must, reference, athena, teaching, the, art, of, shipbuilding, or, navigation, in, a, temple, at, phrixa, in, elis, reportedly, built, by, clymenus, she, was, known, as, cydonia, pausanias, wrote, that, at, buporthmus, there, was, a, sanctuary, of, athena, promachorma, meaning, protector, of, the, anchorage, the, greek, biographer, plutarch, describes, pericles, s, dedication, of, a, statue, to, her, as, athena, hygieia, health, after, she, inspired, in, a, dream, his, successful, treatment, of, a, man, injured, during, the, construction, of, the, gateway, to, the, acropolis, at, athens, there, is, the, temple, of, athena, phratria, as, patron, of, a, phratry, in, the, ancient, agora, of, athens, athena, s, epithet, pallas, her, most, renowned, one, is, derived, either, from, meaning, to, brandish, or, more, likely, from, and, related, words, meaning, youth, young, woman, on, this, topic, walter, burkert, says, she, is, the, pallas, of, athens, pallas, athenaie, just, as, hera, of, argos, is, here, argeie, in, later, times, after, the, original, meaning, of, the, name, had, been, forgotten, the, greeks, invented, myths, to, explain, its, origins, such, as, those, reported, by, the, epicurean, philosopher, philodemus, and, the, bibliotheca, of, pseudo, apollodorus, which, claim, that, pallas, was, originally, a, separate, entity, whom, athena, had, slain, in, combat, in, one, version, of, the, myth, pallas, was, the, daughter, of, the, sea, god, triton, and, she, and, athena, were, childhood, friends, zeus, one, day, watched, athena, and, pallas, have, a, friendly, sparring, match, not, wanting, his, daughter, to, lose, zeus, flapped, his, aegis, to, distract, pallas, whom, athena, accidentally, impaled, distraught, over, what, she, had, done, athena, took, the, name, pallas, for, herself, as, a, sign, of, her, grief, and, tribute, to, her, friend, and, zeus, gave, her, the, aegis, as, an, apology, in, another, version, of, the, story, pallas, was, a, giant, athena, slew, him, during, the, gigantomachy, and, flayed, off, his, skin, to, make, her, cloak, which, she, wore, as, a, victory, trophy, in, an, alternative, variation, of, the, same, myth, pallas, was, instead, athena, s, father, who, attempted, to, assault, his, own, daughter, causing, athena, to, kill, him, and, take, his, skin, as, a, trophy, the, palladium, was, a, statue, of, athena, that, was, said, to, have, stood, in, her, temple, on, the, trojan, acropolis, athena, was, said, to, have, carved, the, statue, herself, in, the, likeness, of, her, dead, friend, pallas, the, statue, had, special, talisman, like, properties, and, it, was, thought, that, as, long, as, it, was, in, the, city, troy, could, never, fall, when, the, greeks, captured, troy, cassandra, the, daughter, of, priam, clung, to, the, palladium, for, protection, but, ajax, the, lesser, violently, tore, her, away, from, it, and, dragged, her, over, to, the, other, captives, athena, was, infuriated, by, this, violation, of, her, protection, although, agamemnon, attempted, to, placate, her, anger, with, sacrifices, athena, sent, a, storm, at, cape, kaphereos, to, destroy, almost, the, entire, greek, fleet, and, scatter, all, of, the, surviving, ships, across, the, aegean, in, homer, s, epic, works, athena, s, most, common, epithet, is, glaukopis, which, usually, is, translated, as, bright, eyed, or, with, gleaming, eyes, the, word, is, a, combination, of, glauk, s, meaning, gleaming, silvery, and, later, bluish, green, or, gray, and, ps, eye, face, the, word, gla, x, little, owl, is, from, the, same, root, presumably, according, to, some, because, of, the, bird, s, own, distinctive, eyes, athena, was, associated, with, the, owl, from, very, early, on, in, archaic, images, she, is, frequently, depicted, with, an, owl, perched, on, her, hand, through, its, association, with, athena, the, owl, evolved, into, the, national, mascot, of, the, athenians, and, eventually, became, a, symbol, of, wisdom, in, the, iliad, 4, 514, the, odyssey, 3, 378, the, homeric, hymns, and, in, hesiod, s, theogony, athena, is, also, given, the, curious, epithet, tritogeneia, whose, significance, remains, unclear, it, could, mean, various, things, including, triton, born, perhaps, indicating, that, the, homonymous, sea, deity, was, her, parent, according, to, some, early, myths, one, myth, relates, the, foster, father, relationship, of, this, triton, towards, the, half, orphan, athena, whom, he, raised, alongside, his, own, daughter, pallas, ker, nyi, suggests, that, tritogeneia, did, not, mean, that, she, came, into, the, world, on, any, particular, river, or, lake, but, that, she, was, born, of, the, water, itself, for, the, name, triton, seems, to, be, associated, with, water, generally, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, athena, is, occasionally, referred, to, as, tritonia, another, possible, meaning, may, be, triple, born, or, third, born, which, may, refer, to, a, triad, or, to, her, status, as, the, third, daughter, of, zeus, or, the, fact, she, was, born, from, metis, zeus, and, herself, various, legends, list, her, as, being, the, first, child, after, artemis, and, apollo, though, other, legends, identify, her, as, zeus, first, child, several, scholars, have, suggested, a, connection, to, the, rigvedic, god, trita, who, was, sometimes, grouped, in, a, body, of, three, mythological, poets, michael, janda, has, connected, the, myth, of, trita, to, the, scene, in, the, iliad, in, which, the, three, brothers, zeus, poseidon, and, hades, divide, the, world, between, them, receiving, the, broad, sky, the, sea, and, the, underworld, respectively, janda, further, connects, the, myth, of, athena, being, born, of, the, head, i, e, the, uppermost, part, of, zeus, understanding, trito, which, perhaps, originally, meant, the, third, as, another, word, for, the, sky, in, janda, s, analysis, of, indo, european, mythology, this, heavenly, sphere, is, also, associated, with, the, mythological, body, of, water, surrounding, the, inhabited, world, cfr, triton, s, mother, amphitrite, yet, another, possible, meaning, is, mentioned, in, diogenes, laertius, biography, of, democritus, that, athena, was, called, tritogeneia, because, three, things, on, which, all, mortal, life, depends, come, from, her, in, her, aspect, of, athena, polias, athena, was, venerated, as, the, goddess, of, the, city, and, the, protectress, of, the, citadel, in, athens, the, plynteria, or, feast, of, the, bath, was, observed, every, year, at, the, end, of, the, month, of, thargelion, the, festival, lasted, for, five, days, during, this, period, the, priestesses, of, athena, or, plyntr, des, performed, a, cleansing, ritual, within, the, erechtheion, a, sanctuary, devoted, to, athena, and, poseidon, here, athena, s, statue, was, undressed, her, clothes, washed, and, body, purified, athena, was, worshipped, at, festivals, such, as, chalceia, as, athena, ergane, the, patroness, of, various, crafts, especially, weaving, she, was, also, the, patron, of, metalworkers, and, was, believed, to, aid, in, the, forging, of, armor, and, weapons, during, the, late, fifth, century, bc, the, role, of, goddess, of, philosophy, became, a, major, aspect, of, athena, s, cult, as, athena, promachos, she, was, believed, to, lead, soldiers, into, battle, athena, represented, the, disciplined, strategic, side, of, war, in, contrast, to, her, brother, ares, the, patron, of, violence, bloodlust, and, slaughter, the, raw, force, of, war, athena, was, believed, to, only, support, those, fighting, for, a, just, cause, and, was, thought, to, view, war, primarily, as, a, means, to, resolve, conflict, the, greeks, regarded, athena, with, much, higher, esteem, than, ares, athena, was, especially, worshipped, in, this, role, during, the, festivals, of, the, panathenaea, and, pamboeotia, both, of, which, prominently, featured, displays, of, athletic, and, military, prowess, as, the, patroness, of, heroes, and, warriors, athena, was, believed, to, favor, those, who, used, cunning, and, intelligence, rather, than, brute, strength, in, her, aspect, as, a, warrior, maiden, athena, was, known, as, parthenos, virgin, because, like, her, fellow, goddesses, artemis, and, hestia, she, was, believed, to, remain, perpetually, a, virgin, athena, s, most, famous, temple, the, parthenon, on, the, athenian, acropolis, takes, its, name, from, this, title, according, to, karl, ker, nyi, a, scholar, of, greek, mythology, the, name, parthenos, is, not, merely, an, observation, of, athena, s, virginity, but, also, a, recognition, of, her, role, as, enforcer, of, rules, of, sexual, modesty, and, ritual, mystery, even, beyond, recognition, the, athenians, allotted, the, goddess, value, based, on, this, pureness, of, virginity, which, they, upheld, as, a, rudiment, of, female, behavior, ker, nyi, s, study, and, theory, of, athena, explains, her, virginal, epithet, as, a, result, of, her, relationship, to, her, father, zeus, and, a, vital, cohesive, piece, of, her, character, throughout, the, ages, this, role, is, expressed, in, several, stories, about, athena, marinus, of, neapolis, reports, that, when, christians, removed, the, statue, of, the, goddess, from, the, parthenon, a, beautiful, woman, appeared, in, a, dream, to, proclus, a, devotee, of, athena, and, announced, that, the, athenian, lady, wished, to, dwell, with, him, athena, was, also, credited, with, creating, the, pebble, based, form, of, divination, those, pebbles, were, called, thriai, which, was, also, the, collective, name, of, a, group, of, nymphs, with, prophetic, powers, her, half, brother, apollo, however, angered, and, spiteful, at, the, practitioners, of, an, art, rival, to, his, own, complained, to, their, father, zeus, about, it, with, the, pretext, that, many, people, took, to, casting, pebbles, but, few, actually, were, true, prophets, zeus, sympathizing, with, apollo, s, grievances, discredited, the, pebble, divination, by, rendering, the, pebbles, useless, apollo, s, words, became, the, basis, of, an, ancient, greek, idiom, athena, was, not, only, the, patron, goddess, of, athens, but, also, other, cities, including, pergamon, argos, sparta, gortyn, lindos, and, larisa, the, various, cults, of, athena, were, all, branches, of, her, panhellenic, cult, and, often, proctored, various, initiation, rites, of, grecian, youth, such, as, the, passage, into, citizenship, by, young, men, or, the, passage, of, young, women, into, marriage, these, cults, were, portals, of, a, uniform, socialization, even, beyond, mainland, greece, athena, was, frequently, equated, with, aphaea, a, local, goddess, of, the, island, of, aegina, originally, from, crete, and, also, associated, with, artemis, and, the, nymph, britomartis, in, arcadia, she, was, assimilated, with, the, ancient, goddess, alea, and, worshiped, as, athena, alea, sanctuaries, dedicated, to, athena, alea, were, located, in, the, laconian, towns, of, mantineia, and, tegea, the, temple, of, athena, alea, in, tegea, was, an, important, religious, center, of, ancient, greece, the, geographer, pausanias, was, informed, that, the, temenos, had, been, founded, by, aleus, athena, had, a, major, temple, on, the, spartan, acropolis, where, she, was, venerated, as, poliouchos, and, khalk, oikos, of, the, brazen, house, often, latinized, as, chalcioecus, this, epithet, may, refer, to, the, fact, that, cult, statue, held, there, may, have, been, made, of, bronze, that, the, walls, of, the, temple, itself, may, have, been, made, of, bronze, or, that, athena, was, the, patron, of, metal, workers, bells, made, of, terracotta, and, bronze, were, used, in, sparta, as, part, of, athena, s, cult, an, ionic, style, temple, to, athena, polias, was, built, at, priene, in, the, fourth, century, bc, it, was, designed, by, pytheos, of, priene, the, same, architect, who, designed, the, mausoleum, at, halicarnassus, the, temple, was, dedicated, by, alexander, the, great, and, an, inscription, from, the, temple, declaring, his, dedication, is, now, held, in, the, british, museum, she, was, worshipped, as, athena, asia, in, colchis, supposedly, on, an, account, of, a, nearby, mountain, with, that, name, from, which, her, worship, was, believed, to, have, been, brought, by, castor, and, pollux, to, laconia, where, a, temple, was, built, to, her, at, las, in, pergamon, athena, was, thought, to, have, been, a, god, of, the, cosmos, and, the, aspects, of, it, that, aided, pergamon, and, its, fate, she, was, the, daughter, of, zeus, produced, without, a, mother, and, emerged, full, grown, from, his, forehead, there, was, an, alternate, story, that, zeus, swallowed, metis, the, goddess, of, counsel, while, she, was, pregnant, with, athena, and, when, she, was, fully, grown, she, emerged, from, zeus, forehead, being, the, favorite, child, of, zeus, she, had, great, power, in, the, classical, olympian, pantheon, athena, was, regarded, as, the, favorite, child, of, zeus, born, fully, armed, from, his, forehead, the, story, of, her, birth, comes, in, several, versions, the, earliest, mention, is, in, book, v, of, the, iliad, when, ares, accuses, zeus, of, being, biased, in, favor, of, athena, because, autos, egeinao, literally, you, fathered, her, but, probably, intended, as, you, gave, birth, to, her, she, was, essentially, urban, and, civilized, the, antithesis, in, many, respects, of, artemis, goddess, of, the, outdoors, athena, was, probably, a, pre, hellenic, goddess, and, was, later, taken, over, by, the, greeks, in, the, version, recounted, by, hesiod, in, his, theogony, zeus, married, the, goddess, metis, who, is, described, as, the, wisest, among, gods, and, mortal, men, and, engaged, in, sexual, intercourse, with, her, after, learning, that, metis, was, pregnant, however, he, became, afraid, that, the, unborn, offspring, would, try, to, overthrow, him, because, gaia, and, ouranos, had, prophesied, that, metis, would, bear, children, wiser, than, their, father, in, order, to, prevent, this, zeus, tricked, metis, into, letting, him, swallow, her, but, it, was, too, late, because, metis, had, already, conceived, a, later, account, of, the, story, from, the, bibliotheca, of, pseudo, apollodorus, written, in, the, second, century, ad, makes, metis, zeus, s, unwilling, sexual, partner, rather, than, his, wife, according, to, this, version, of, the, story, metis, transformed, into, many, different, shapes, in, effort, to, escape, zeus, but, zeus, successfully, raped, her, and, swallowed, her, after, swallowing, metis, zeus, took, six, more, wives, in, succession, until, he, married, his, seventh, and, present, wife, hera, then, zeus, experienced, an, enormous, headache, he, was, in, such, pain, that, he, ordered, someone, either, prometheus, hephaestus, hermes, ares, or, palaemon, depending, on, the, sources, examined, to, cleave, his, head, open, with, the, labrys, the, double, headed, minoan, axe, athena, leaped, from, zeus, s, head, fully, grown, and, armed, the, first, homeric, hymn, to, athena, states, in, lines, 9, 16, that, the, gods, were, awestruck, by, athena, s, appearance, and, even, helios, the, god, of, the, sun, stopped, his, chariot, in, the, sky, pindar, in, his, seventh, olympian, ode, states, that, she, cried, aloud, with, a, mighty, shout, and, that, the, sky, and, mother, earth, shuddered, before, her, hesiod, states, that, hera, was, so, annoyed, at, zeus, for, having, given, birth, to, a, child, on, his, own, that, she, conceived, and, bore, hephaestus, by, herself, but, in, imagines, 2, 27, trans, fairbanks, the, third, century, ad, greek, rhetorician, philostratus, the, elder, writes, that, hera, rejoices, at, athena, s, birth, as, though, athena, were, her, daughter, also, the, second, century, ad, christian, apologist, justin, martyr, takes, issue, with, those, pagans, who, erect, at, springs, images, of, kore, whom, he, interprets, as, athena, they, said, that, athena, was, the, daughter, of, zeus, not, from, intercourse, but, when, the, god, had, in, mind, the, making, of, a, world, through, a, word, logos, his, first, thought, was, athena, according, to, a, version, of, the, story, in, a, scholium, on, the, iliad, found, nowhere, else, when, zeus, swallowed, metis, she, was, pregnant, with, athena, by, the, cyclops, brontes, the, etymologicum, magnum, instead, deems, athena, the, daughter, of, the, daktyl, itonos, fragments, attributed, by, the, christian, eusebius, of, caesarea, to, the, semi, legendary, phoenician, historian, sanchuniathon, which, eusebius, thought, had, been, written, before, the, trojan, war, make, athena, instead, the, daughter, of, cronus, a, king, of, byblos, who, visited, the, inhabitable, world, and, bequeathed, attica, to, athena, in, homer, s, iliad, athena, as, a, war, goddess, inspired, and, fought, alongside, the, greek, heroes, her, aid, was, synonymous, with, military, prowess, also, in, the, iliad, zeus, the, chief, god, specifically, assigned, the, sphere, of, war, to, ares, the, god, of, war, and, athena, athena, s, moral, and, military, superiority, to, ares, derived, in, part, from, the, fact, that, she, represented, the, intellectual, and, civilized, side, of, war, and, the, virtues, of, justice, and, skill, whereas, ares, represented, mere, blood, lust, her, superiority, also, derived, in, part, from, the, vastly, greater, variety, and, importance, of, her, functions, and, the, patriotism, of, homer, s, predecessors, ares, being, of, foreign, origin, in, the, iliad, athena, was, the, divine, form, of, the, heroic, martial, ideal, she, personified, excellence, in, close, combat, victory, and, glory, the, qualities, that, led, to, victory, were, found, on, the, aegis, or, breastplate, that, athena, wore, when, she, went, to, war, fear, strife, defense, and, assault, athena, appears, in, homer, s, odyssey, as, the, tutelary, deity, of, odysseus, and, myths, from, later, sources, portray, her, similarly, as, the, helper, of, perseus, and, heracles, hercules, as, the, guardian, of, the, welfare, of, kings, athena, became, the, goddess, of, good, counsel, prudent, restraint, and, practical, insight, and, war, in, a, founding, myth, reported, by, pseudo, apollodorus, athena, competed, with, poseidon, for, the, patronage, of, athens, they, agreed, that, each, would, give, the, athenians, one, gift, and, that, cecrops, the, king, of, athens, would, determine, which, gift, was, better, poseidon, struck, the, ground, with, his, trident, and, a, salt, water, spring, sprang, up, this, gave, the, athenians, access, to, trade, and, water, athens, at, its, height, was, a, significant, sea, power, defeating, the, persian, fleet, at, the, battle, of, salamis, but, the, water, was, salty, and, undrinkable, in, an, alternative, version, of, the, myth, from, vergil, s, georgics, poseidon, instead, gave, the, athenians, the, first, horse, athena, offered, the, first, domesticated, olive, tree, cecrops, accepted, this, gift, and, declared, athena, the, patron, goddess, of, athens, the, olive, tree, brought, wood, oil, and, food, and, became, a, symbol, of, athenian, economic, prosperity, robert, graves, was, of, the, opinion, that, poseidon, s, attempts, to, take, possession, of, certain, cities, are, political, myths, which, reflect, the, conflict, between, matriarchal, and, patriarchal, religions, afterwards, poseidon, was, so, angry, over, his, defeat, that, he, sent, one, of, his, sons, halirrhothius, to, cut, down, the, tree, but, as, he, swung, his, axe, he, missed, his, aim, and, it, fell, in, himself, killing, him, this, was, supposedly, the, origin, of, calling, athena, s, sacred, olive, tree, moria, for, halirrhotius, s, attempt, at, revenge, proved, fatal, moros, in, greek, poseidon, in, fury, accused, ares, of, murder, and, the, matter, was, eventually, settled, on, the, areopagus, hill, of, ares, in, favour, of, ares, which, was, thereafter, named, after, the, event, pseudo, apollodorus, records, an, archaic, legend, which, claims, that, hephaestus, once, attempted, to, rape, athena, but, she, pushed, him, away, causing, him, to, ejaculate, on, her, thigh, athena, wiped, the, semen, off, using, a, tuft, of, wool, which, she, tossed, into, the, dust, impregnating, gaia, and, causing, her, to, give, birth, to, erichthonius, athena, adopted, erichthonius, as, her, son, and, raised, him, the, roman, mythographer, hyginus, records, a, similar, story, in, which, hephaestus, demanded, zeus, to, let, him, marry, athena, since, he, was, the, one, who, had, smashed, open, zeus, s, skull, allowing, athena, to, be, born, zeus, agreed, to, this, and, hephaestus, and, athena, were, married, but, when, hephaestus, was, about, to, consummate, the, union, athena, vanished, from, the, bridal, bed, causing, him, to, ejaculate, on, the, floor, thus, impregnating, gaia, with, erichthonius, the, geographer, pausanias, records, that, athena, placed, the, infant, erichthonius, into, a, small, chest, cista, which, she, entrusted, to, the, care, of, the, three, daughters, of, cecrops, herse, pandrosos, and, aglauros, of, athens, she, warned, the, three, sisters, not, to, open, the, chest, but, did, not, explain, to, them, why, or, what, was, in, it, aglauros, and, possibly, one, of, the, other, sisters, opened, the, chest, differing, reports, say, that, they, either, found, that, the, child, itself, was, a, serpent, that, it, was, guarded, by, a, serpent, that, it, was, guarded, by, two, serpents, or, that, it, had, the, legs, of, a, serpent, in, pausanias, s, story, the, two, sisters, were, driven, mad, by, the, sight, of, the, chest, s, contents, and, hurled, themselves, off, the, acropolis, dying, instantly, but, an, attic, vase, painting, shows, them, being, chased, by, the, serpent, off, the, edge, of, the, cliff, instead, erichthonius, was, one, of, the, most, important, founding, heroes, of, athens, and, the, legend, of, the, daughters, of, cecrops, was, a, cult, myth, linked, to, the, rituals, of, the, arrhephoria, festival, pausanias, records, that, during, the, arrhephoria, two, young, girls, known, as, the, arrhephoroi, who, lived, near, the, temple, of, athena, polias, would, be, given, hidden, objects, by, the, priestess, of, athena, which, they, would, carry, on, their, heads, down, a, natural, underground, passage, they, would, leave, the, objects, they, had, been, given, at, the, bottom, of, the, passage, and, take, another, set, of, hidden, objects, which, they, would, carry, on, their, heads, back, up, to, the, temple, the, ritual, was, performed, in, the, dead, of, night, and, no, one, not, even, the, priestess, knew, what, the, objects, were, the, serpent, in, the, story, may, be, the, same, one, depicted, coiled, at, athena, s, feet, in, pheidias, s, famous, statue, of, the, athena, parthenos, in, the, parthenon, many, of, the, surviving, sculptures,

interpreted, it, as, a, sign, that, athena, herself, had, abandoned, them, another, version, of, the, myth, of, the, athenian, maidens, is, told, in, metamorphoses, by, the, roman, poet, ovid, 43, bc,

to, ovid, s, rendition, of, it, and, the, only, earlier, reference, to, it, is, a, brief, allusion, in, virgil, s, georgics, 29, bc, iv, 246, that, does, not, mention, arachne, by, name, according, to, ovid, arachne, whose, name, means, spider, in, ancient, greek, was, the, daughter, of, a, famous, dyer, in, tyrian, purple, in, hypaipa, of, lydia, and, a, weaving, student, of, athena, she, became, so, conceited, of, her, skill, as, a, weaver, that, she, began, claiming, that, her, skill, was, greater, than, that, of, athena, herself, athena, gave, arachne, a, chance, to, redeem, herself, by, assuming, the, form, of, an, old, woman, and, warning, arachne, not, to, offend, the, deities, arachne, scoffed, and, wished, for, a, weaving, contest, so, she, could, prove, her, skill,

europa, and, with, dana, it, represented, the, unjust, and, discrediting, behavior, of, the, gods, towards, mortals, athena, admitted, that, arachne, s, work, was, flawless, but, was, outraged, at, arachne, s, offensive, choice, of, subject, which, displayed, the, failings, and, transgressions, of, the, deities, finally, losing, her, temper, athena, destroyed, arachne, s, tapestry, and, loom, striking, it, with, her, shuttle, athena, then, struck, arachne, across, the, face, with, her, staff, four, times, arachne, hanged, herself, in, despair, but, athena, took, pity, on, her, and, brought, her, back, from, the, dead, in, the, form, of, a, spider, in, a, rarer, version, surviving, in, the, scholia, of, an, unnamed, scholiast, on, nicander, whose, works, heavily, influenced, ovid, arachne, is, placed, in, attica, instead, and, has, a, brother, named, phalanx, athena, taught, arachne, the, art, of, weaving, and, phalanx, the, art, of, war, but, when, brother, and, sister, laid, together, in, bed, athena, was, so, disgusted, with, them, that, she, turned, them, both, into, spiders, animals, forever, doomed, to, be, eaten, by, their, own, young, the, myth, of, the, judgement, of, paris, is, mentioned, briefly, in, the, iliad, but, is, described, in, depth, in, an, epitome, of, the, cypria, a, lost, poem, of, the, epic, cycle, which, records, that, all, the, gods, and, goddesses, as, well, as, various, mortals, were, invited, to, the, marriage, of, peleus, and, thetis, the, eventual, parents, of, achilles, only, eris, goddess, of, discord, was, not, invited, she, was, annoyed, at, this, so, she, arrived, with, a, golden, apple, inscribed, with, the, word, kallist, i, for, the, fairest, which, she, threw, among, the, goddesses, aphrodite, hera, and, athena, all, claimed, to, be, the, fairest, and, thus, the, rightful, owner, of, the, apple, the, goddesses, chose, to, place, the, matter, before, zeus, who, not, wanting, to, favor, one, of, the, goddesses, put, the, choice, into, the, hands, of, paris, a, trojan, prince, after, bathing, in, the, spring, of, mount, ida, where, troy, was, situated, the, goddesses, appeared, before, paris,
