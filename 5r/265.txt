the, upanishads, having, proposed, multiple, sanskrit, etymologies, for, aum, including, from, m, yes, from, vam, that, thus, yes, and, from, the, sanskrit, roots, v, to, urge, or, p, to, attain, in, 1889, maurice, bloomfield, proposed, an, origin, from, a, proto, indo, european, introductory, particle, au, with, a, function, similar, to, the, sanskrit, particle, atha, however, contemporary, indologist, asko, parpola, proposes, a, borrowing, from, dravidian, m, meaning, it, is, so, let, it, be, so, yes, a, contraction, of, kum, cognate, with, modern, tamil, m, meaning, yes, in, the, jaffna, tamil, dialect, spoken, in, sri, lanka, aum, is, the, word, for, yes, regardless, of, its, original, meaning, the, syllable, om, evolves, to, mean, many, abstract, ideas, even, in, the, earliest, upanishads, max, m, ller, and, other, scholars, state, that, these, philosophical, texts, recommend, om, as, a, basic, tool, for, meditation, and, explain, the, various, meanings, that, the, syllable, may, hold, in, the, mind, of, one, meditating, ranging, from, artificial, and, senseless, to, the, highest, concepts, such, as, the, cause, of, the, universe, essence, of, life, brahman, atman, and, self, knowledge, the, syllable, om, is, first, mentioned, in, the, upanishads, it, has, been, associated, with, various, concepts, such, as, cosmic, sound, mystical, syllable, affirmation, to, something, divine, or, as, symbolism, for, abstract, spiritual, concepts, in, the, upanishads, in, the, aranyaka, and, the, brahmana, layers, of, vedic, texts, the, syllable, is, so, widespread, and, linked, to, knowledge, that, it, stands, for, the, whole, of, veda, the, symbolic, foundations, of, om, are, repeatedly, discussed, in, the, oldest, layers, of, the, early, upanishads, the, aitareya, brahmana, of, rig, veda, in, section, 5, 32, suggests, that, the, three, phonetic, components, of, om, a, u, m, correspond, to, the, three, stages, of, cosmic, creation, and, when, it, is, read, or, said, it, celebrates, the, creative, powers, of, the, universe, however, in, the, eight, anuvaka, of, the, taittiriya, upanishad, which, consensus, research, indicates, was, formulated, around, the, same, time, or, preceding, aitareya, brahmana, the, sound, aum, is, attributed, to, reflecting, the, inner, part, of, the, word, brahman, put, another, way, it, is, the, brahman, in, the, form, of, a, word, the, brahmana, layer, of, vedic, texts, equates, om, with, bhur, bhuvah, svah, which, symbolizes, the, whole, veda, they, offer, various, shades, of, meaning, to, om, such, as, it, being, the, universe, beyond, the, sun, or, that, which, is, mysterious, and, inexhaustible, or, the, infinite, language, the, infinite, knowledge, or, essence, of, breath, life, everything, that, exists, or, that, with, which, one, is, liberated, the, samaveda, the, poetical, veda, orthographically, maps, om, to, the, audible, the, musical, truths, in, its, numerous, variations, oum, aum, ov, ov, ov, um, etc, and, then, attempts, to, extract, musical, meters, from, it, when, occurring, within, spoken, classical, sanskrit, the, syllable, is, subject, to, the, normal, rules, of, sandhi, in, sanskrit, grammar, with, the, additional, peculiarity, that, the, initial, o, of, om, is, the, gu, a, vowel, grade, of, u, not, the, v, ddhi, grade, and, is, therefore, pronounced, as, a, monophthong, with, a, long, vowel, ie, m, not, aum, furthermore, the, final, m, is, often, assimilated, into, the, preceding, vowel, as, nasalisation, ra, ga, as, a, result, om, is, regularly, pronounced, in, the, context, of, sanskrit, however, this, o, reflects, the, older, vedic, sanskrit, diphthong, au, which, at, that, stage, in, the, language, s, history, had, not, yet, monophthongised, to, o, this, being, so, the, syllable, om, is, often, archaically, considered, as, consisting, of, three, phonemes, a, u, m, accordingly, some, denominations, maintain, the, archaic, diphthong, au, viewing, it, to, be, more, authentic, and, closer, to, the, language, of, the, vedas, in, the, context, of, the, vedas, particularly, the, vedic, brahmanas, the, vowel, is, often, pluta, three, times, as, long, indicating, a, length, of, three, morae, trim, tra, that, is, the, time, it, takes, to, say, three, light, syllables, additionally, a, diphthong, becomes, pluta, with, the, prolongation, of, its, first, vowel, when, e, and, o, undergo, pluti, they, typically, revert, to, the, original, diphthongs, with, the, initial, a, prolonged, realised, as, an, overlong, open, back, unrounded, vowel, um, or, a3um, this, extended, duration, is, emphasised, by, denominations, who, regard, it, as, more, authentically, vedic, such, as, arya, samaj, however, om, is, also, attested, in, the, upanishads, without, pluta, and, many, languages, related, to, or, influenced, by, classical, sanskrit, such, as, hindustani, share, its, pronunciation, of, om, or, nagari, or, devanagari, representations, are, found, epigraphically, on, sculpture, dating, from, medieval, india, and, on, ancient, coins, in, regional, scripts, throughout, south, asia, om, is, represented, in, devanagari, as, composed, of, four, elements, the, vowel, letter, a, the, vowel, diacritic, o, the, consonant, letter, m, and, the, virama, stroke, which, indicates, the, absence, of, an, implied, final, vowel, historically, the, combination, represented, a, diphthong, often, transcribed, as, au, but, it, now, represents, a, long, vowel, see, above, the, syllable, is, sometimes, written, where, i, e, the, digit, 3, explicitly, indicates, pluta, three, times, as, long, which, is, otherwise, only, implied, for, this, same, reason, om, may, also, be, written, in, languages, such, as, hindi, with, the, avagraha, being, used, to, indicate, prolonging, the, vowel, sound, however, this, differs, from, the, usage, of, the, avagraha, in, sanskrit, where, it, would, instead, indicate, the, prodelision, of, the, initial, vowel, om, may, also, be, written, with, an, anusv, ra, reflecting, the, pronunciation, of, in, languages, such, as, hindi, in, languages, such, as, urdu, and, sindhi, om, may, be, written, in, arabic, script, although, speakers, of, these, languages, may, also, use, devanagari, representations, the, commonly, seen, representation, of, the, syllable, om, is, a, cursive, ligature, in, devanagari, combining, a, with, u, and, the, chandrabindu, in, unicode, the, symbol, is, encoded, at, u, 0950, devanagari, om, and, at, u, 1f549, om, symbol, as, a, generic, symbol, independent, of, devanagari, font, in, some, south, asian, writing, systems, the, om, symbol, has, been, simplified, further, in, bengali, and, assamese, om, is, written, simply, as, without, an, additional, curl, in, languages, such, as, bengali, differences, in, pronunciation, compared, to, sanskrit, have, made, the, addition, of, a, curl, for, u, redundant, although, the, spelling, is, simpler, the, pronunciation, remains, similarly, in, odia, om, is, written, as, without, an, additional, diacritic, in, tamil, om, is, written, as, a, ligature, of, and, m, while, in, kannada, telugu, and, malayalam, om, is, written, simply, as, the, letter, for, followed, by, anusv, ra, and, respectively, there, have, been, proposals, that, the, om, syllable, may, already, have, had, written, representations, in, brahmi, script, dating, to, before, the, common, era, a, proposal, by, deb, 1921, held, that, the, swastika, is, a, monogrammatic, representation, of, the, syllable, om, wherein, two, brahmi, o, characters, u, 11011, brahmi, letter, o, were, superposed, crosswise, and, the, m, was, represented, by, dot, a, commentary, in, nature, 1922, considers, this, theory, questionable, and, unproven, a, b, walawalkar, 1951, proposed, that, om, was, represented, using, the, brahmi, symbols, for, a, u, and, m, and, that, this, may, have, influenced, the, unusual, epigraphical, features, of, the, symbol, for, om, parker, 1909, wrote, that, an, aum, monogram, distinct, from, the, swastika, is, found, among, tamil, brahmi, inscriptions, in, sri, lanka, including, anuradhapura, era, coins, dated, from, the, 1st, to, 4th,

popular, yantra, in, southeast, asia, particularly, in, cambodia, and, thailand, it, frequently, appears, in, sak, yant, religious, tattoos, and, has, been, a, part, of, various, flags, and, official,
