in, nicene, christianity, the, holy, spirit, otherwise, known, as, the, holy, ghost, is, the, third, person, of, the, trinity, in, judaism, the, holy, spirit, is, the, divine, force, quality, and, influence, of, the, unitary, god, over, the, universe, or, his, creatures, in, islam, the, holy, spirit, acts, as, an, agent, of, divine, action, or, communication, in, the, baha, i, faith, the, holy, spirit, is, seen, as, the, intermediary, between, god, and, man, and, the, outpouring, grace, of, god, and, the, effulgent, rays, that, emanate, from, his, manifestation, the, hebrew, bible, contains, the, term, spirit, of, god, ruach, elochim, which, by, jews, is, interpreted, in, the, sense, of, the, might, of, a, unitary, god, this, interpretation, is, different, from, the, nicene, christian, conception, of, the, holy, spirit, as, one, person, of, the, trinity, the, christian, concept, tends, to, emphasize, the, moral, aspect, of, the, holy, spirit, as, a, common, expression, in, the, christian, new, testament, based, on, the, old, testament, the, book, of, acts, emphasizes, the, power, of, ministry, aspect, of, the, holy, spirit, in, general, jews, reject, any, conception, of, a, co, equal, multi, person, godhead, anything, but, an, absolute, monotheism, is, contrary, to, the, shema, they, do, not, consider, the, hebrew, word, for, one, hebrew, ekhad, as, meaning, anything, other, than, a, simple, numerical, one, the, rabbinical, understanding, of, the, holy, spirit, has, a, certain, degree, of, personification, but, it, remains, a, quality, belonging, to, god, one, of, his, attributes, the, idea, of, god, as, a, duality, or, trinity, is, considered, shituf, or, not, purely, monotheistic, according, to, theologian, rudolf, bultmann, there, are, two, ways, to, think, about, the, holy, spirit, animistic, and, dynamistic, in, animistic, thinking, he, is, an, independent, agent, a, personal, power, which, can, fall, upon, a, man, and, take, possession, of, him, enabling, him, or, compelling, him, to, perform, manifestations, of, power, while, in, dynamistic, thought, it, appears, as, an, impersonal, force, which, fills, a, man, like, a, fluid, both, kinds, of, thought, appear, in, jewish, and, christian, scripture, but, animistic, is, more, typical, of, the, old, testament, whereas, dynamistic, is, more, common, in, the, new, testament, the, distinction, coincides, with, the, holy, spirit, as, either, a, temporary, or, permanent, gift, in, the, old, testament, and, jewish, thought, it, is, primarily, temporary, with, a, specific, situation, or, task, in, mind, whereas, in, the, christian, concept, the, gift, resides, in, persons, permanently, on, the, surface, the, holy, spirit, appears, to, have, an, equivalent, in, non, abrahamic, hellenistic, mystery, religions, these, religions, included, a, distinction, between, the, spirit, and, psyche, which, is, also, seen, in, the, pauline, epistles, according, to, proponents, of, the, history, of, religions, school, the, christian, concept, of, the, holy, spirit, cannot, be, explained, from, jewish, ideas, alone, without, reference, to, the, hellenistic, religions, and, according, to, theologian, erik, konsmo, the, views, are, so, dissimilar, that, the, only, legitimate, connection, one, can, make, is, with, the, greek, term, itself, another, link, with, ancient, greek, thought, is, the, stoic, idea, of, the, spirit, as, anima, mundi, or, world, soul, that, unites, all, people, some, believe, that, this, can, be, seen, in, paul, s, formulation, of, the, concept, of, the, holy, spirit, that, unites, christians, in, jesus, christ, and, love, for, one, another, but, konsmo, again, thinks, that, this, position, is, difficult, to, maintain, in, his, introduction, to, the, 1964, book, meditations, the, anglican, priest, maxwell, staniforth, wrote, another, stoic, concept, which, offered, inspiration, to, the, church, was, that, of, divine, spirit, cleanthes, wishing, to, give, more, explicit, meaning, to, zeno, s, creative, fire, had, been, the, first, to, hit, upon, the, term, pneuma, or, spirit, to, describe, it, like, fire, this, intelligent, spirit, was, imagined, as, a, tenuous, substance, akin, to, a, current, of, air, or, breath, but, essentially, possessing, the, quality, of, warmth, it, was, immanent, in, the, universe, as, god, and, in, man, as, the, soul, and, life, giving, principle, clearly, it, is, not, a, long, step, from, this, to, the, holy, spirit, of, christian, theology, the, lord, and, giver, of, life, visibly, manifested, as, tongues, of, fire, at, pentecost, and, ever, since, associated, in, the, christian, as, in, the, stoic, mind, with, the, ideas, of, vital, fire, and, beneficent, warmth, the,
