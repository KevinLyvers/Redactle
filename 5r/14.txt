phenomenology, is, the, philosophical, study, of, objectivity, and, more, generally, reality, as, subjectively, lived, and, experienced, it, seeks, to, investigate, the, universal, features, of, consciousness, while, avoiding, assumptions, about, the, external, world, aiming, to, describe, phenomena, as, they, appear, to, the, subject, and, to, explore, the, meaning, and, significance, of, the, lived, experiences, this, approach, has, found, many, applications, in, qualitative, research, across, different, scientific, disciplines, especially, in, the, social, sciences, humanities, psychology, and, cognitive, science, but, also, in, fields, as, diverse, as, health, sciences, architecture, and, human, computer, interaction, among, many, others, the, application, of, phenomenology, in, these, fields, aims, to, gain, a, deeper, understanding, of, subjective, experience, rather, than, focusing, on, behavior, phenomenology, is, contrasted, with, phenomenalism, which, reduces, mental, states, and, physical, objects, to, complexes, of, sensations, and, with, psychologism, which, treats, logical, truths, or, epistemological, principles, as, the, products, of, human, psychology, in, particular, transcendental, phenomenology, as, outlined, by, edmund, husserl, aims, to, arrive, at, an, objective, understanding, of, the, world, via, the, discovery, of, universal, logical, structures, in, human, subjective, experience, there, are, important, differences, in, the, ways, that, different, branches, of, phenomenology, approach, subjectivity, for, example, according, to, martin, heidegger, truths, are, contextually, situated, and, dependent, on, the, historical, cultural, and, social, context, in, which, they, emerge, other, types, include, hermeneutic, genetic, and, embodied, phenomenology, all, these, different, branches, of, phenomenology, may, be, seen, as, representing, different, philosophies, despite, sharing, the, common, foundational, approach, of, phenomenological, inquiry, that, is, investigating, things, just, as, they, appear, independent, of, any, particular, theoretical, framework, the, term, phenomenology, derives, from, the, greek, phain, menon, that, which, appears, and, l, gos, study, it, entered, the, english, language, around, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, and, first, appeared, in, direct, connection, to, husserl, s, philosophy, in, a, 1907, article, in, the, philosophical, review, in, philosophy, phenomenology, refers, to, the, tradition, inaugurated, by, edmund, husserl, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, term, however, had, been, used, in, different, senses, in, other, philosophy, texts, since, the, 18th, century, these, include, those, by, johann, heinrich, lambert, 1728, 1777, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, g, w, f, hegel, 1770, 1831, and, carl, stumpf, 1848, 1936, among, others, it, was, however, the, usage, of, franz, brentano, and, as, he, later, acknowledged, ernst, mach, that, would, prove, definitive, for, husserl, from, brentano, husserl, took, the, conviction, that, philosophy, must, commit, itself, to, description, of, what, is, given, in, direct, self, evidence, central, to, brentano, s, phenomenological, project, was, his, theory, of, intentionality, which, he, developed, from, his, reading, of, aristotle, s, on, the, soul, according, to, the, phenomenological, tradition, the, central, structure, of, an, experience, is, its, intentionality, it, being, directed, towards, something, as, it, is, an, experience, of, or, about, some, object, also, on, this, theory, every, intentional, act, is, implicitly, accompanied, by, a, secondary, pre, reflective, awareness, of, the, act, as, one, s, own, phenomenology, proceeds, systematically, but, it, does, not, attempt, to, study, consciousness, from, the, perspective, of, clinical, psychology, or, neurology, instead, it, seeks, to, determine, the, essential, properties, and, structures, of, experience, phenomenology, is, not, a, matter, of, individual, introspection, a, subjective, account, of, experience, which, is, the, topic, of, psychology, must, be, distinguished, from, an, account, of, subjective, experience, which, is, the, topic, of, phenomenology, its, topic, is, not, mental, states, but, worldly, things, considered, in, a, certain, way, phenomenology, is, a, direct, reaction, to, the, psychologism, and, physicalism, of, husserl, s, time, it, takes, as, its, point, of, departure, the, question, of, how, objectivity, is, possible, at, all, when, the, experience, of, the, world, and, its, objects, is, thoroughly, subjective, so, far, from, being, a, form, of, subjectivism, phenomenologists, argue, that, the, scientific, ideal, of, a, purely, objective, third, person, is, a, fantasy, and, falsity, the, perspective, and, presuppositions, of, the, scientist, must, be, articulated, and, taken, into, account, in, the, design, of, the, experiment, and, the, interpretation, of, its, results, inasmuch, as, phenomenology, is, able, to, accomplish, this, it, can, help, to, improve, the, quality, of, empirical, scientific, research, in, spite, of, the, field, s, internal, diversity, shaun, gallagher, and, dan, zahavi, argue, that, the, phenomenological, method, is, composed, of, four, basic, steps, the, poche, the, phenomenological, reduction, the, eidetic, variation, and, intersubjective, corroboration, according, to, maurice, natanson, the, radicality, of, the, phenomenological, method, is, both, continuous, and, discontinuous, with, philosophy, s, general, effort, to, subject, experience, to, fundamental, critical, scrutiny, to, take, nothing, for, granted, and, to, show, the, warranty, for, what, we, claim, to, know, according, to, husserl, the, suspension, of, belief, in, what, is, ordinarily, taken, for, granted, or, inferred, by, conjecture, diminishes, the, power, of, what, is, customarily, embraced, as, objective, reality, in, the, words, of, r, diger, safranski, great, ambition, was, to, disregard, anything, that, had, until, then, been, thought, or, said, about, consciousness, or, the, world, on, the, lookout, for, a, new, way, of, letting, the, things, approach, them, without, covering, them, up, with, what, they, already, knew, edmund, husserl, set, the, phenomenological, agenda, for, even, those, who, did, not, strictly, adhere, to, his, teachings, such, as, martin, heidegger, jean, paul, sartre, and, maurice, merleau, ponty, to, name, just, the, foremost, each, thinker, has, different, conceptions, of, phenomenology, different, methods, and, different, results, husserl, derived, many, important, concepts, central, to, phenomenology, from, the, works, and, lectures, of, his, teachers, the, philosophers, and, psychologists, franz, brentano, and, carl, stumpf, an, important, element, of, phenomenology, that, husserl, borrowed, from, brentano, is, intentionality, often, described, as, aboutness, or, directedness, the, notion, that, consciousness, is, always, consciousness, of, something, the, object, of, consciousness, is, called, the, intentional, object, and, this, object, is, constituted, for, consciousness, in, many, different, ways, through, for, instance, perception, memory, signification, and, so, forth, throughout, these, different, intentionalities, though, they, have, different, structures, and, different, ways, of, being, about, the, object, an, object, is, still, constituted, as, the, identical, object, consciousness, is, directed, at, the, same, intentional, object, in, direct, perception, as, it, is, in, the, immediately, following, retention, of, this, object, and, the, eventual, remembering, of, it, as, envisioned, by, husserl, phenomenology, is, a, method, of, philosophical, inquiry, that, rejects, the, rationalist, bias, that, has, dominated, western, thought, since, plato, in, favor, of, a, method, of, reflective, attentiveness, that, discloses, the, individual, s, lived, experience, loosely, rooted, in, an, epistemological, device, called, epoch, husserl, s, method, entails, the, suspension, of, judgment, while, relying, on, the, intuitive, grasp, of, knowledge, free, of, presuppositions, and, intellectualizing, sometimes, depicted, as, the, science, of, experience, the, phenomenological, method, rooted, in, intentionality, represents, an, alternative, to, the, representational, theory, of, consciousness, that, theory, holds, that, reality, cannot, be, grasped, directly, because, it, is, available, only, through, perceptions, of, reality, that, are, representations, in, the, mind, in, husserl, s, own, words, experience, is, not, an, opening, through, which, a, world, existing, prior, to, all, experience, shines, into, a, room, of, consciousness, it, is, not, a, mere, taking, of, something, alien, to, consciousness, into, consciousness, experience, is, the, performance, in, which, for, me, the, experiencer, experienced, being, is, there, and, is, there, as, what, it, is, with, the, whole, content, and, the, mode, of, being, that, experience, itself, by, the, performance, going, on, in, its, intentionality, attributes, to, it, in, effect, he, counters, that, consciousness, is, not, in, the, mind, rather, consciousness, is, conscious, of, something, other, than, itself, the, intentional, object, regardless, of, whether, the, object, is, a, physical, thing, or, just, a, figment, of, the, imagination, in, the, first, edition, of, the, logical, investigations, under, the, influence, of, brentano, husserl, describes, his, position, as, descriptive, psychology, husserl, analyzes, the, intentional, structures, of, mental, acts, and, how, they, are, directed, at, both, real, and, ideal, objects, the, first, volume, of, the, logical, investigations, the, prolegomena, to, pure, logic, begins, with, a, critique, of, psychologism, that, is, the, attempt, to, subsume, the, a, priori, validity, of, the, laws, of, logic, under, psychology, husserl, establishes, a, separate, field, for, research, in, logic, philosophy, and, phenomenology, independently, from, the, empirical, sciences, pre, reflective, self, consciousness, is, shaun, gallagher, and, dan, zahavi, s, term, for, husserl, s, 1900, 1901, idea, that, self, consciousness, always, involves, a, self, appearance, or, self, manifestation, prior, to, self, reflection, this, is, one, point, of, nearly, unanimous, agreement, among, phenomenologists, a, minimal, form, of, self, consciousness, is, a, constant, structural, feature, of, conscious, experience, experience, happens, for, the, experiencing, subject, in, an, immediate, way, and, as, part, of, this, immediacy, it, is, implicitly, marked, as, my, experience, in, 1913, husserl, published, ideas, general, introduction, to, pure, phenomenology, in, this, work, he, presents, phenomenology, as, a, form, of, transcendental, idealism, although, husserl, claimed, to, have, always, been, a, transcendental, idealist, this, was, not, how, many, of, his, admirers, had, interpreted, the, logical, investigations, and, some, were, alienated, as, a, result, this, work, introduced, distinctions, between, the, act, of, consciousness, noesis, and, the, phenomena, at, which, it, is, directed, the, noemata, noetic, refers, to, the, intentional, act, of, consciousness, believing, willing, etc, noematic, refers, to, the, object, or, content, noema, which, appears, in, the, noetic, acts, the, believed, wanted, hated, loved, etc, what, is, observed, is, not, the, object, as, it, is, in, itself, but, how, and, inasmuch, it, is, given, in, the, intentional, acts, knowledge, of, essences, would, only, be, possible, by, bracketing, all, assumptions, about, the, existence, of, an, external, world, and, the, inessential, subjective, aspects, of, how, the, object, is, concretely, given, to, us, this, phenomenological, reduction, is, the, second, stage, of, husserl, s, procedure, of, epoch, that, which, is, essential, is, then, determined, by, the, imaginative, work, of, eidetic, variation, which, is, a, method, for, clarifying, the, features, of, a, thing, without, which, it, would, not, be, what, it, is, husserl, concentrated, more, on, the, ideal, essential, structures, of, consciousness, as, he, wanted, to, exclude, any, hypothesis, on, the, existence, of, external, objects, he, introduced, the, method, of, phenomenological, reduction, to, eliminate, them, what, was, left, over, was, the, pure, transcendental, ego, as, opposed, to, the, concrete, empirical, ego, transcendental, phenomenology, is, the, study, of, the, essential, structures, that, are, left, in, pure, consciousness, this, amounts, in, practice, to, the, study, of, the, noemata, and, the, relations, among, them, some, phenomenologists, were, critical, of, the, new, theories, espoused, in, ideas, members, of, the, munich, group, such, as, max, scheler, and, roman, ingarden, distanced, themselves, from, husserl, s, new, transcendental, phenomenology, their, theoretical, allegiance, was, to, the, earlier, realist, phenomenology, of, the, first, edition, of, logical, investigations, martin, heidegger, modified, husserl, s, conception, of, phenomenology, because, of, what, heidegger, perceived, as, husserl, s, subjectivist, tendencies, whereas, husserl, conceived, humans, as, having, been, constituted, by, states, of, consciousness, heidegger, countered, that, consciousness, is, peripheral, to, the, primacy, of, one, s, existence, for, which, he, introduces, dasein, as, a, technical, term, which, cannot, be, reduced, to, a, mode, of, consciousness, from, this, angle, one, s, state, of, mind, is, an, effect, rather, than, a, determinant, of, existence, including, those, aspects, of, existence, of, which, one, is, not, conscious, by, shifting, the, center, of, gravity, to, existence, in, what, he, calls, fundamental, ontology, heidegger, altered, the, subsequent, direction, of, phenomenology, according, to, heidegger, philosophy, was, more, fundamental, than, science, itself, according, to, him, science, is, only, one, way, of, knowing, the, world, with, no, special, access, to, truth, furthermore, the, scientific, mindset, itself, is, built, on, a, much, more, primordial, foundation, of, practical, everyday, knowledge, this, emphasis, on, the, fundamental, status, of, a, person, s, pre, cognitive, practical, orientation, in, the, world, sometimes, called, know, how, would, be, adopted, by, both, sartre, and, merleau, ponty, while, for, husserl, in, the, epoch, being, appeared, only, as, a, correlate, of, consciousness, for, heidegger, the, pre, conscious, grasp, of, being, is, the, starting, point, for, this, reason, he, replaces, husserl, s, concept, of, intentionality, with, the, notion, of, comportment, which, is, presented, as, more, primitive, than, the, conceptually, structured, acts, analyzed, by, husserl, paradigmatic, examples, of, comportment, can, be, found, in, the, unreflective, dealing, with, equipment, that, presents, itself, as, simply, ready, to, hand, in, what, heidegger, calls, the, normally, circumspect, mode, of, engagement, within, the, world, for, husserl, all, concrete, determinations, of, the, empirical, ego, would, have, to, be, abstracted, in, order, to, attain, pure, consciousness, by, contrast, heidegger, claims, that, the, possibilities, and, destinies, of, philosophy, are, bound, up, with, man, s, existence, and, thus, with, temporality, and, with, historicality, for, this, reason, all, experience, must, be, seen, as, shaped, by, social, context, which, for, heidegger, joins, phenomenology, with, philosophical, hermeneutics, husserl, charged, heidegger, with, raising, the, question, of, ontology, but, failing, to, answer, it, instead, switching, the, topic, to, dasein, that, is, neither, ontology, nor, phenomenology, according, to, husserl, but, merely, abstract, anthropology, while, being, and, time, and, other, early, works, are, clearly, engaged, with, husserlian, issues, heidegger, s, later, philosophy, has, little, relation, to, the, problems, and, methods, of, classical, phenomenology, maurice, merleau, ponty, develops, his, distinctive, mode, of, phenomenology, by, drawing, in, particular, upon, husserl, s, unpublished, writings, heidegger, s, analysis, of, being, in, the, world, gestalt, theory, and, other, contemporary, psychology, research, in, his, most, famous, work, the, phenomenology, of, perception, merleau, ponty, critiques, empiricist, and, intellectualist, accounts, to, chart, a, third, way, that, avoids, their, metaphysical, assumptions, about, an, objective, pre, given, world, the, central, contentions, of, this, work, are, that, the, body, is, the, locus, of, engagement, with, the, world, and, that, the, body, s, modes, of, engagement, are, more, fundamental, than, what, phenomenology, describes, as, consequent, acts, of, objectification, merleau, ponty, reinterprets, concepts, like, intentionality, the, phenomenological, reduction, and, the, eidetic, method, to, capture, our, inherence, in, the, perceived, world, that, is, our, embodied, coexistence, with, things, through, a, kind, of, reciprocal, exchange, according, to, merleau, ponty, perception, discloses, a, meaningful, world, that, can, never, be, completely, determined, but, which, nevertheless, aims, at, truth, some, scholars, have, differentiated, phenomenology, into, these, seven, types, the, contrast, between, constitutive, phenomenology, sometimes, static, phenomenology, or, descriptive, phenomenology, and, genetic, phenomenology, sometimes, phenomenology, of, genesis, is, due, to, husserl, modern, scholarship, also, recognizes, the, existence, of, the, following, varieties, late, heidegger, s, transcendental, hermeneutic, phenomenology, maurice, merleau, ponty, s, embodied, phenomenology, michel, henry, s, material, phenomenology, alva, no, s, analytic, phenomenology, and, j, l, austin, s, linguistic, phenomenology, intentionality, refers, to, the, notion, that, consciousness, is, always, the, consciousness, of, something, the, word, itself, should, not, be, confused, with, the, ordinary, use, of, the, word, intentional, but, should, rather, be, taken, as, playing, on, the, etymological, roots, of, the, word, originally, intention, referred, to, a, stretching, out, in, tension, from, latin, intendere, and, in, this, context, it, refers, to, consciousness, stretching, out, towards, its, object, however, one, should, be, careful, with, this, image, there, is, not, some, consciousness, first, that, subsequently, stretches, out, to, its, object, rather, consciousness, occurs, as, the, simultaneity, of, a, conscious, act, and, its, object, intentionality, is, often, summed, up, as, aboutness, whether, this, something, that, consciousness, is, about, is, in, direct, perception, or, in, fantasy, is, inconsequential, to, the, concept, of, intentionality, itself, whatever, consciousness, is, directed, at, that, is, what, consciousness, is, conscious, of, this, means, that, the, object, of, consciousness, does, not, have, to, be, a, physical, object, apprehended, in, perception, it, can, just, as, well, be, a, fantasy, or, a, memory, consequently, these, structures, of, consciousness, such, as, perception, memory, fantasy, and, so, forth, are, called, intentionalities, the, term, intentionality, originated, with, the, scholastics, in, the, medieval, period, and, was, resurrected, by, brentano, who, in, turn, influenced, husserl, s, conception, of, phenomenology, who, refined, the, term, and, made, it, the, cornerstone, of, his, theory, of, consciousness, the, meaning, of, the, term, is, complex, and, depends, entirely, on, how, it, is, conceived, by, a, given, philosopher, the, term, should, not, be, confused, with, intention, or, the, psychoanalytic, conception, of, unconscious, motive, or, gain, significantly, intentionality, is, not, a, relation, but, rather, an, intrinsic, feature, of, intentional, acts, this, is, because, there, are, no, independent, relata, it, is, at, least, in, the, first, place, a, matter, of, indifference, to, the, phenomenologist, whether, the, intentional, object, has, any, existence, independent, of, the, act, intuition, in, phenomenology, refers, to, cases, where, the, intentional, object, is, directly, present, to, the, intentionality, at, play, if, the, intention, is, filled, by, the, direct, apprehension, of, the, object, one, has, an, intuited, object, having, a, cup, of, coffee, in, front, of, oneself, for, instance, seeing, it, feeling, it, or, even, imagining, it, these, are, all, filled, intentions, and, the, object, is, then, intuited, the, same, goes, for, the, apprehension, of, mathematical, formulae, or, a, number, if, one, does, not, have, the, object, as, referred, to, directly, the, object, is, not, intuited, but, still, intended, but, then, emptily, examples, of, empty, intentions, can, be, signitive, intentions, intentions, that, only, imply, or, refer, to, their, objects, in, everyday, language, the, word, evidence, is, used, to, signify, a, special, sort, of, relation, between, a, state, of, affairs, and, a, proposition, state, a, is, evidence, for, the, proposition, a, is, true, in, phenomenology, however, the, concept, of, evidence, is, meant, to, signify, the, subjective, achievement, of, truth, this, is, not, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, objective, sort, of, evidence, to, subjective, opinion, but, rather, an, attempt, to, describe, the, structure, of, having, something, present, in, intuition, with, the, addition, of, having, it, present, as, intelligible, evidence, is, the, successful, presentation, of, an, intelligible, object, the, successful, presentation, of, something, whose, truth, becomes, manifest, in, the, evidencing, itself, in, ideas, husserl, presents, as, the, principle, of, all, principles, that, every, originary, presentive, intuition, is, a, legitimizing, source, of, cognition, that, everything, originally, so, to, speak, in, its, personal, actuality, offered, to, us, in, intuition, is, to, be, accepted, simply, as, what, it, is, presented, as, being, but, also, only, within, the, limits, in, which, it, is, presented, there, it, is, in, this, realm, of, phenomenological, givenness, husserl, claims, that, the, search, begins, for, indubitable, evidence, that, will, ultimately, serve, as, the, foundation, for, every, scientific, discipline, franz, brentano, introduced, a, distinction, between, sensory, and, noetic, consciousness, the, former, describes, presentations, of, sensory, objects, or, intuitions, while, the, latter, describes, the, thinking, of, concepts, in, husserl, s, phenomenology, this, pair, of, terms, derived, from, the, greek, nous, mind, designate, respectively, the, real, content, noesis, and, the, ideal, content, noema, of, an, intentional, act, an, act, of, consciousness, the, noesis, is, the, part, of, the, act, that, gives, it, a, particular, sense, or, character, as, in, judging, or, perceiving, something, loving, or, hating, it, accepting, or, rejecting, it, etc, this, is, real, in, the, sense, that, it, is, actually, part, of, what, takes, place, in, the, consciousness, of, the, subject, of, the, act, the, noesis, is, always, correlated, with, a, noema, for, husserl, the, full, noema, is, a, complex, ideal, structure, comprising, at, least, a, noematic, sense, and, a, noematic, core, the, correct, interpretation, of, what, husserl, meant, by, the, noema, has, long, been, controversial, but, the, noematic, sense, is, generally, understood, as, the, ideal, meaning, of, the, act, for, instance, if, a, loves, b, loving, is, a, real, part, of, a, s, conscious, activity, noesis, but, gets, its, sense, from, the, general, concept, of, loving, which, has, an, abstract, or, ideal, meaning, as, loving, has, a, meaning, in, the, english, language, independently, of, what, an, individual, means, by, the, word, when, they, use, it, the, noematic, core, as, the, act, s, referent, or, object, as, it, is, meant, in, the, act, one, element, of, controversy, is, whether, this, noematic, object, is, the, same, as, the, actual, object, of, the, act, assuming, it, exists, or, is, some, kind, of, ideal, object, in, phenomenology, empathy, refers, to, the, experience, of, one, s, own, body, as, another, while, people, often, identify, others, with, their, physical, bodies, this, type, of, phenomenology, requires, that, they, focus, on, the, subjectivity, of, the, other, as, well, as, the, intersubjective, engagement, with, them, in, husserl, s, original, account, this, was, done, by, a, sort, of, apperception, built, on, the, experiences, of, one, s, own, lived, body, the, lived, body, is, one, s, own, body, as, experienced, by, oneself, as, oneself, one, s, own, body, manifests, itself, mainly, as, one, s, possibilities, of, acting, in, the, world, it, is, what, lets, oneself, reach, out, and, grab, something, for, instance, but, it, also, and, more, importantly, allows, for, the, possibility, of, changing, one, s, point, of, view, this, helps, to, differentiate, one, thing, from, another, by, the, experience, of, moving, around, it, seeing, new, aspects, of, it, often, referred, to, as, making, the, absent, present, and, the, present, absent, and, still, retaining, the, notion, that, this, is, the, same, thing, that, one, saw, other, aspects, of, just, a, moment, ago, it, is, identical, one, s, body, is, also, experienced, as, a, duality, both, as, object, one, s, ability, to, touch, one, s, own, hand, and, as, one, s, own, subjectivity, one, s, experience, of, being, touched, the, experience, of, one, s, own, body, as, one, s, own, subjectivity, is, then, applied, to, the, experience, of, another, s, body, which, through, apperception, is, constituted, as, another, subjectivity, one, can, thus, recognise, the, other, s, intentions, emotions, etc, this, experience, of, empathy, is, important, in, the, phenomenological, account, of, intersubjectivity, in, phenomenology, intersubjectivity, constitutes, objectivity, i, e, what, one, experiences, as, objective, is, experienced, as, being, intersubjectively, available, available, to, all, other, subjects, this, does, not, imply, that, objectivity, is, reduced, to, subjectivity, nor, does, it, imply, a, relativist, position, cf, for, instance, intersubjective, verifiability, in, the, experience, of, intersubjectivity, one, also, experiences, oneself, as, being, a, subject, among, other, subjects, and, one, experiences, oneself, as, existing, objectively, for, these, others, one, experiences, oneself, as, the, noema, of, others, noeses, or, as, a, subject, in, another, s, empathic, experience, as, such, one, experiences, oneself, as, objectively, existing, subjectivity, intersubjectivity, is, also, a, part, in, the, constitution, of, one, s, lifeworld, especially, as, homeworld, the, lifeworld, german, lebenswelt, is, the, world, each, one, of, us, lives, in, one, could, call, it, the, background, or, horizon, of, all, experience, and, it, is, that, on, which, each, object, stands, out, as, itself, as, different, and, with, the, meaning, it, can, only, hold, for, us, according, to, husserl, the, lifeworld, is, both, personal, and, intersubjective, it, is, then, called, a, homeworld, and, as, such, it, avoids, the, threat, of, solipsism, the, phenomenological, analysis, of, objects, is, notably, different, from, traditional, science, however, several, frameworks, do, phenomenology, with, an, empirical, orientation, or, aim, to, unite, it, with, the, natural, sciences, or, with, cognitive, science, for, a, classical, critical, point, of, view, daniel, dennett, argues, for, the, wholesale, uselessness, of, phenomenology, considering, phenomena, as, qualia, which, cannot, be, the, object, of, scientific, research, or, do, not, exist, in, the, first, place, liliana, albertazzi, counters, such, arguments, by, pointing, out, that, empirical, research, on, phenomena, has, been, successfully, carried, out, employing, modern, methodology, human, experience, can, be, investigated, by, surveying, and, with, brain, scanning, techniques, for, example, ample, research, on, color, perception, suggests, that, people, with, normal, color, vision, see, colors, similarly, and, not, each, in, their, own, way, thus, it, is, possible, to, universalize, phenomena, of, subjective, experience, on, an, empirical, scientific, basis, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, phenomenology, has, increasingly, engaged, with, cognitive, science, and, philosophy, of, mind, some, approaches, to, the, naturalization, of, phenomenology, reduce, consciousness, to, the, physical, neuronal, level, and, are, therefore, not, widely, acknowledged, as, representing, phenomenology, these, include, the, frameworks, of, neurophenomenology, embodied, constructivism, and, the, cognitive, neuroscience, of, phenomenology, other, likewise, controversial, approaches, aim, to, explain, life, world, experience, on, a, sociological, or, anthropological, basis, despite, phenomenology, being, mostly, considered, descriptive, rather, than, explanatory
