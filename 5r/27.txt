from, the, parliament, of, the, world, s, religions, 1993, proclaimed, the, golden, rule, we, must, treat, others, as, we, wish, others, to, treat, us, as, the, common, principle, for, many, religions, the, initial, declaration, was, signed, by, 143, leaders, from, all, of, the, world, s, major, faiths, including, bah, faith, brahmanism, brahma, kumaris, buddhism, christianity, hinduism, indigenous, interfaith, islam, jainism, judaism, native, american, neo, pagan, sikhism, taoism, theosophist, unitarian, universalist, and, zoroastrian, in, the, folklore, of, several, cultures, the, golden, rule, is, depicted, by, the, allegory, of, the, long, spoons, in, the, view, of, greg, m, epstein, a, humanist, chaplain, at, harvard, university, do, unto, others, is, a, concept, that, essentially, no, religion, misses, entirely, but, not, a, single, one, of, these, versions, of, the, golden, rule, requires, a, god, various, sources, identify, the, golden, rule, as, a, humanist, principle, trying, to, live, according, to, the, golden, rule, means, trying, to, empathise, with, other, people, including, those, who, may, be, very, different, from, us, empathy, is, at, the, root, of, kindness, compassion, understanding, and, respect, qualities, that, we, all, appreciate, being, shown, whoever, we, are, whatever, we, think, and, wherever, we, come, from, and, although, it, isn, t, possible, to, know, what, it, really, feels, like, to, be, a, different, person, or, live, in, different, circumstances, and, have, different, life, experiences, it, isn, t, difficult, for, most, of, us, to, imagine, what, would, cause, us, suffering, and, to, try, to, avoid, causing, suffering, to, others, for, this, reason, many, people, find, the, golden, rule, s, corollary, do, not, treat, people, in, a, way, you, would, not, wish, to, be, treated, yourself, more, pragmatic, do, not, do, to, others, what, you, would, not, want, them, to, do, to, you, the, single, greatest, simplest, and, most, important, moral, axiom, humanity, has, ever, invented, one, which, reappears, in, the, writings, of, almost, every, culture, and, religion, throughout, history, the, one, we, know, as, the, golden, rule, moral, directives, do, not, need, to, be, complex, or, obscure, to, be, worthwhile, and, in, fact, it, is, precisely, this, rule, s, simplicity, which, makes, it, great, it, is, easy, to, come, up, with, easy, to, understand, and, easy, to, apply, and, these, three, things, are, the, hallmarks, of, a, strong, and, healthy, moral, system, the, idea, behind, it, is, readily, graspable, before, performing, an, action, which, might, harm, another, person, try, to, imagine, yourself, in, their, position, and, consider, whether, you, would, want, to, be, the, recipient, of, that, action, if, you, would, not, want, to, be, in, such, a, position, the, other, person, probably, would, not, either, and, so, you, should, not, do, it, it, is, the, basic, and, fundamental, human, trait, of, empathy, the, ability, to, vicariously, experience, how, another, is, feeling, that, makes, this, possible, and, it, is, the, principle, of, empathy, by, which, we, should, live, our, lives, when, we, say, that, man, chooses, for, himself, we, do, mean, that, every, one, of, us, must, choose, himself, but, by, that, we, also, mean, that, in, choosing, for, himself, he, chooses, for, all, men, for, in, effect, of, all, the, actions, a, man, may, take, in, order, to, create, himself, as, he, wills, to, be, there, is, not, one, which, is, not, creative, at, the, same, time, of, an, image, of, man, such, as, he, believes, he, ought, to, be, to, choose, between, this, or, that, is, at, the, same, time, to, affirm, the, value, of, that, which, is, chosen, for, we, are, unable, ever, to, choose, the, worse, what, we, choose, is, always, the, better, and, nothing, can, be, better, for, us, unless, it, is, better, for, all, john, stuart, mill, in, his, book, utilitarianism, originally, published, in, 1861, wrote, in, the, golden, rule, of, jesus, of, nazareth, we, read, the, complete, spirit, of, the, ethics, of, utility, to, do, as, you, would, be, done, by, and, to, love, your, neighbour, as, yourself, constitute, the, ideal, perfection, of, utilitarian, morality, according, to, marc, h, bornstein, and, william, e, paden, the, golden, rule, is, arguably, the, most, essential, basis, for, the, modern, concept, of, human, rights, in, which, each, individual, has, a, right, to, just, treatment, and, a, reciprocal, responsibility, to, ensure, justice, for, others, however, leo, damrosch, argued, that, the, notion, that, the, golden, rule, pertains, to, rights, per, se, is, a, contemporary, interpretation, and, has, nothing, to, do, with, its, origin, the, development, of, human, rights, is, a, modern, political, ideal, that, began, as, a, philosophical, concept, promulgated, through, the, philosophy, of, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, 18th, century, france, among, others, his, writings, influenced, thomas, jefferson, who, then, incorporated, rousseau, s, reference, to, inalienable, rights, into, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, in, 1776, damrosch, argued, that, to, confuse, the, golden, rule, with, human, rights, is, to, apply, contemporary, thinking, to, ancient, concepts, some, published, research, argues, that, some, sense, of, fair, play, and, the, golden, rule, may, be, stated, and, rooted, in, terms, of, neuroscientific, and, neuroethical, principles, the, golden, rule, can, also, be, explained, from, the, perspectives, of, psychology, philosophy, sociology, human, evolution, and, economics, psychologically, it, involves, a, person, empathizing, with, others, philosophically, it, involves, a, person, perceiving, their, neighbor, also, as, i, or, self, sociologically, love, your, neighbor, as, yourself, is, applicable, between, individuals, between, groups, and, also, between, individuals, and, groups, in, evolution, reciprocal, altruism, is, seen, as, a, distinctive, advance, in, the, capacity, of, human, groups, to, survive, and, reproduce, as, their, exceptional, brains, demanded, exceptionally, long, childhoods, and, ongoing, provision, and, protection, even, beyond, that, of, the, immediate, family, in, economics, richard, swift, referring, to, ideas, from, david, graeber, suggests, that, without, some, kind, of, reciprocity, society, would, no, longer, be, able, to, exist, study, of, other, primates, provides, evidence, that, the, golden, rule, exists, in, other, non, human, species, philosophers, such, as, immanuel, kant, and, friedrich, nietzsche, have, objected, to, the, rule, on, a, variety, of, grounds, one, is, the, epistemic, question, of, determining, how, others, want, to, be, treated, the, obvious, way, is, to, ask, them, but, they, might, give, duplicitous, answers, if, they, find, this, strategically, useful, and, they, might, also, fail, to, understand, the, details, of, the, choice, situation, as, you, understand, it, we, might, also, be, biased, to, perceiving, harms, and, benefits, to, ourselves, more, than, to, others, which, could, lead, to, escalating, conflict, if, we, are, suspicious, of, others, hence, linus, pauling, suggested, that, we, introduce, a, bias, towards, others, into, the, golden, rule, do, unto, others, 20, percent, better, than, you, would, have, them, do, unto, you, to, correct, for, subjective, bias, one, religion, that, officially, rejects, the, golden, rule, is, the, neo, nazi, religion, of, the, creativity, movement, founded, by, ben, klassen, followers, of, the, religion, believe, that, the, golden, rule, doesn, t, make, sense, and, is, a, completely, unworkable, principle, george, bernard, shaw, wrote, do, not, do, unto, others, as, you, would, that, they, should, do, unto, you, their, tastes, may, not, be, the, same, this, suggests, that, if, your, values, are, not, shared, with, others, the, way, you, want, to, be, treated, will, not, be, the, way, they, want, to, be, treated, hence, the, golden, rule, of, do, unto, others, is, dangerous, in, the, wrong, hands, according, to, philosopher, iain, king, because, some, fanatics, have, no, aversion, to, death, the, golden, rule, might, inspire, them, to, kill, others, in, suicide, missions, walter, terence, stace, in, the, concept, of, morals, 1937, argued, that, shaw, s, remark, seems, to, overlook, the, fact, that, doing, as, you, would, be, done, by, includes, taking, into, account, your, neighbour, s, tastes, as, you, would, that, he, should, take, yours, into, account, thus, the, golden, rule, might, still, express, the, essence, of, a, universal, morality, even, if, no, two, men, in, the, world, had, any, needs, or, tastes, in, common, immanuel, kant, famously, criticized, the, golden, rule, for, not, being, sensitive, to, differences, of, situation, noting, that, a, prisoner, duly, convicted, of, a, crime, could, appeal, to, the, golden, rule, while, asking, the, judge, to, release, him, pointing, out, that, the, judge, would, not, want, anyone, else, to, send, him, to, prison, so, he, should, not, do, so, to, others, on, the, other, hand, in, a, critique, of, the, consistency, of, kant, s, writings, several, authors, have, noted, the, similarity, between, the, golden, rule, and, kant, s, categorical, imperative, introduced, in, groundwork, of, the, metaphysic, of, morals, see, discussion, at, this, link, this, was, perhaps, a, well, known, objection, as, leibniz, actually, responded, to, it, long, before, kant, made, it, suggesting, that, the, judge, should, put, himself, in, the, place, not, merely, of, the, criminal, but, of, all, affected, persons, and, then, judging, each, option, to, inflict, punishment, or, release, the, criminal, etc, by, whether, there, was, a, greater, good, in, which, this, lesser, evil, was, included, marcus, george, singer, observed, that, there, are, two, importantly, different, ways, of, looking, at, the, golden, rule, as, requiring, 1, that, you, perform, specific, actions, that, you, want, others, to, do, to, you, or, 2, that, you, guide, your, behavior, in, the, same, general, ways, that, you, want, others, to, counter, examples, to, the, golden, rule, typically, are, more, forceful, against, the, first, than, the, second, in, his, book, on, the, golden, rule, jeffrey, wattles, makes, the, similar, observation, that, such, objections, typically, arise, while, applying, the, golden, rule, in, certain, general, ways, namely, ignoring, differences, in, taste, or, situation, failing, to, compensate, for, subjective, bias, etc, but, if, we, apply, the, golden, rule, to, our, own, method, of, using, it, asking, in, effect, if, we, would, want, other, people, to, apply, the, golden, rule, in, such, ways, the, answer, would, typically, be, no, since, others, ignoring, of, such, factors, will, lead, to, behavior, which, we, object, to, it, follows, that, we, should, not, do, so, ourselves, according, to, the, golden, rule, in, this, way, the, golden, rule, may, be, self, correcting, an, article, by, jouni, reinikainen, develops, this, suggestion, in, greater, detail, it, is, possible, then, that, the, golden, rule, can, itself, guide, us, in, identifying, which, differences, of, situation, are, morally, relevant, we, would, often, want, other, people, to, ignore, any, prejudice, against, our, race, or, nationality, when, deciding, how, to, act, towards, us, but, would, also, want, them, to, not, ignore, our, differing, preferences, in, food, desire, for, aggressiveness, and, so, on, this, principle, of, doing, unto, others, wherever, possible, as, they, would, be, done, by, has, sometimes, been, termed, the, platinum, rule, charles, kingsley, s, the, water, babies, 1863, includes, a, character, named, mrs, do, as, you, would, be, done, by, and, another, mrs, be, done, by, as, you, did
