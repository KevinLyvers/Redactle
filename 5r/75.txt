https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism
determinism, is, the, philosophical, view, that, all, events, in, the, universe, including, human, decisions, and, actions, are, causally, inevitable, deterministic, theories, throughout, the, history, of, philosophy, have, developed, from, diverse, and, sometimes, overlapping, motives, and, considerations, like, eternalism, determinism, focuses, on, particular, events, rather, than, the, future, as, a, concept, the, opposite, of, determinism, is, indeterminism, or, the, view, that, events, are, not, deterministically, caused, but, rather, occur, due, to, chance, determinism, is, often, contrasted, with, free, will, although, some, philosophers, claim, that, the, two, are, compatible, historically, debates, about, determinism, have, involved, many, philosophical, positions, and, given, rise, to, multiple, varieties, or, interpretations, of, determinism, one, topic, of, debate, concerns, the, scope, of, determined, systems, some, philosophers, have, maintained, that, the, entire, universe, is, a, single, determinate, system, while, others, identify, more, limited, determinate, systems, another, common, debate, topic, is, whether, determinism, and, free, will, can, coexist, compatibilism, and, incompatibilism, represent, the, opposing, sides, of, this, debate, determinism, should, not, be, confused, with, the, self, determination, of, human, actions, by, reasons, motives, and, desires, determinism, is, about, interactions, which, affect, cognitive, processes, in, people, s, lives, it, is, about, the, cause, and, the, result, of, what, people, have, done, cause, and, result, are, always, bound, together, in, cognitive, processes, it, assumes, that, if, an, observer, has, sufficient, information, about, an, object, or, human, being, that, such, an, observer, might, be, able, to, predict, every, consequent, move, of, that, object, or, human, being, determinism, rarely, requires, that, perfect, prediction, be, practically, possible, determinism, may, commonly, refer, to, any, of, the, following, viewpoints, causal, determinism, sometimes, synonymous, with, historical, determinism, a, sort, of, path, dependence, is, the, idea, that, every, event, is, necessitated, by, antecedent, events, and, conditions, together, with, the, laws, of, nature, however, it, is, a, broad, enough, term, to, consider, that, one, s, deliberations, choices, and, actions, will, often, be, necessary, links, in, the, causal, chain, that, brings, something, about, in, other, words, even, though, our, deliberations, choices, and, actions, are, themselves, determined, like, everything, else, it, is, still, the, case, according, to, causal, determinism, that, the, occurrence, or, existence, of, yet, other, things, depends, upon, our, deliberating, choosing, and, acting, in, a, certain, way, causal, determinism, proposes, that, there, is, an, unbroken, chain, of, prior, occurrences, stretching, back, to, the, origin, of, the, universe, the, relation, between, events, and, the, origin, of, the, universe, may, not, be, specified, causal, determinists, believe, that, there, is, nothing, in, the, universe, that, has, no, cause, or, is, self, caused, causal, determinism, has, also, been, considered, more, generally, as, the, idea, that, everything, that, happens, or, exists, is, caused, by, antecedent, conditions, in, the, case, of, nomological, determinism, these, conditions, are, considered, events, also, implying, that, the, future, is, determined, completely, by, preceding, events, a, combination, of, prior, states, of, the, universe, and, the, laws, of, nature, these, conditions, can, also, be, considered, metaphysical, in, origin, such, as, in, the, case, of, theological, determinism, nomological, determinism, is, the, most, common, form, of, causal, determinism, and, is, generally, synonymous, with, physical, determinism, this, is, the, notion, that, the, past, and, the, present, dictate, the, future, entirely, and, necessarily, by, rigid, natural, laws, and, that, every, occurrence, inevitably, results, from, prior, events, nomological, determinism, is, sometimes, illustrated, by, the, thought, experiment, of, laplace, s, demon, although, sometimes, called, scientific, determinism, the, term, is, a, misnomer, for, nomological, determinism, necessitarianism, is, a, metaphysical, principle, that, denies, all, mere, possibility, and, maintains, that, there, is, only, one, possible, way, for, the, world, to, exist, leucippus, claimed, there, are, no, uncaused, events, and, that, everything, occurs, for, a, reason, and, by, necessity, predeterminism, is, the, idea, that, all, events, are, determined, in, advance, the, concept, is, often, argued, by, invoking, causal, determinism, implying, that, there, is, an, unbroken, chain, of, prior, occurrences, stretching, back, to, the, origin, of, the, universe, in, the, case, of, predeterminism, this, chain, of, events, has, been, pre, established, and, human, actions, cannot, interfere, with, the, outcomes, of, this, pre, established, chain, predeterminism, can, be, categorized, as, a, specific, type, of, determinism, when, it, is, used, to, mean, pre, established, causal, determinism, it, can, also, be, used, interchangeably, with, causal, determinism, in, the, context, of, its, capacity, to, determine, future, events, however, predeterminism, is, often, considered, as, independent, of, causal, determinism, the, term, predeterminism, is, also, frequently, used, in, the, context, of, biology, and, heredity, in, which, case, it, represents, a, form, of, biological, determinism, sometimes, called, genetic, determinism, biological, determinism, is, the, idea, that, all, human, behaviors, beliefs, and, desires, are, fixed, by, human, genetic, nature, friedrich, nietzsche, explained, that, human, beings, are, determined, by, their, bodies, and, are, subject, to, its, passions, impulses, and, instincts, fatalism, is, normally, distinguished, from, determinism, as, a, form, of, teleological, determinism, fatalism, is, the, idea, that, everything, is, fated, to, happen, resulting, in, humans, having, no, control, over, their, future, fate, has, arbitrary, power, and, does, not, necessarily, follow, any, causal, or, deterministic, laws, types, of, fatalism, include, hard, theological, determinism, and, the, idea, of, predestination, where, there, is, a, god, who, determines, all, that, humans, will, do, this, may, be, accomplished, through, either, foreknowledge, of, their, actions, achieved, through, omniscience, or, by, predetermining, their, actions, theological, determinism, is, a, form, of, determinism, that, holds, that, all, events, that, happen, are, either, preordained, i, e, predestined, to, happen, by, a, monotheistic, deity, or, are, destined, to, occur, given, its, omniscience, two, forms, of, theological, determinism, exist, referred, to, as, strong, and, weak, theological, determinism, strong, theological, determinism, is, based, on, the, concept, of, a, creator, deity, dictating, all, events, in, history, everything, that, happens, has, been, predestined, to, happen, by, an, omniscient, omnipotent, divinity, weak, theological, determinism, is, based, on, the, concept, of, divine, foreknowledge, because, god, s, omniscience, is, perfect, what, god, knows, about, the, future, will, inevitably, happen, which, means, consequently, that, the, future, is, already, fixed, there, exist, slight, variations, on, this, categorization, however, some, claim, either, that, theological, determinism, requires, predestination, of, all, events, and, outcomes, by, the, divinity, i, e, they, do, not, classify, the, weaker, version, as, theological, determinism, unless, libertarian, free, will, is, assumed, to, be, denied, as, a, consequence, or, that, the, weaker, version, does, not, constitute, theological, determinism, at, all, with, respect, to, free, will, theological, determinism, is, the, thesis, that, god, exists, and, has, infallible, knowledge, of, all, true, propositions, including, propositions, about, our, future, actions, more, minimal, criteria, designed, to, encapsulate, all, forms, of, theological, determinism, theological, determinism, can, also, be, seen, as, a, form, of, causal, determinism, in, which, the, antecedent, conditions, are, the, nature, and, will, of, god, some, have, asserted, that, augustine, of, hippo, introduced, theological, determinism, into, christianity, in, 412, ce, whereas, all, prior, christian, authors, supported, free, will, against, stoic, and, gnostic, determinism, however, there, are, many, biblical, passages, that, seem, to, support, the, idea, of, some, kind, of, theological, determinism, adequate, determinism, is, the, idea, because, of, quantum, decoherence, that, quantum, indeterminacy, can, be, ignored, for, most, macroscopic, events, random, quantum, events, average, out, in, the, limit, of, large, numbers, of, particles, where, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, asymptotically, approach, the, laws, of, classical, mechanics, stephen, hawking, explains, a, similar, idea, he, says, that, the, microscopic, world, of, quantum, mechanics, is, one, of, determined, probabilities, that, is, quantum, effects, rarely, alter, the, predictions, of, classical, mechanics, which, are, quite, accurate, albeit, still, not, perfectly, certain, at, larger, scales, something, as, large, as, an, animal, cell, then, would, be, adequately, determined, even, in, light, of, quantum, indeterminacy, the, many, worlds, interpretation, accepts, the, linear, causal, sets, of, sequential, events, with, adequate, consistency, yet, also, suggests, constant, forking, of, causal, chains, creating, multiple, universes, to, account, for, multiple, outcomes, from, single, events, meaning, the, causal, set, of, events, leading, to, the, present, are, all, valid, yet, appear, as, a, singular, linear, time, stream, within, a, much, broader, unseen, conic, probability, field, of, other, outcomes, that, split, off, from, the, locally, observed, timeline, under, this, model, causal, sets, are, still, consistent, yet, not, exclusive, to, singular, iterated, outcomes, the, interpretation, sidesteps, the, exclusive, retrospective, causal, chain, problem, of, could, not, have, done, otherwise, by, suggesting, the, other, outcome, does, exist, in, a, set, of, parallel, universe, time, streams, that, split, off, when, the, action, occurred, this, theory, is, sometimes, described, with, the, example, of, agent, based, choices, but, more, involved, models, argue, that, recursive, causal, splitting, occurs, with, all, wave, functions, at, play, this, model, is, highly, contested, with, multiple, objections, from, the, scientific, community, although, some, of, the, above, forms, of, determinism, concern, human, behaviors, and, cognition, others, frame, themselves, as, an, answer, to, the, debate, on, nature, and, nurture, they, will, suggest, that, one, factor, will, entirely, determine, behavior, as, scientific, understanding, has, grown, however, the, strongest, versions, of, these, theories, have, been, widely, rejected, as, a, single, cause, fallacy, in, other, words, the, modern, deterministic, theories, attempt, to, explain, how, the, interaction, of, both, nature, and, nurture, is, entirely, predictable, the, concept, of, heritability, has, been, helpful, in, making, this, distinction, other, deterministic, theories, actually, seek, only, to, highlight, the, importance, of, a, particular, factor, in, predicting, the, future, these, theories, often, use, the, factor, as, a, sort, of, guide, or, constraint, on, the, future, they, need, not, suppose, that, complete, knowledge, of, that, one, factor, would, allow, the, making, of, perfect, predictions, structural, determinism, is, the, philosophical, view, that, actions, events, and, processes, are, predicated, on, and, determined, by, structural, factors, given, any, particular, structure, or, set, of, estimable, components, it, is, a, concept, that, emphasizes, rational, and, predictable, outcomes, chilean, biologists, humberto, maturana, and, francisco, varela, popularized, the, notion, writing, that, a, living, system, s, general, order, is, maintained, via, a, circular, process, of, ongoing, self, referral, and, thus, its, organization, and, structure, defines, the, changes, it, undergoes, according, to, the, authors, a, system, can, undergo, changes, of, state, alteration, of, structure, without, loss, of, identity, or, disintegrations, alteration, of, structure, with, loss, of, identity, such, changes, or, disintegrations, are, not, ascertained, by, the, elements, of, the, disturbing, agent, as, each, disturbance, will, only, trigger, responses, in, the, respective, system, which, in, turn, are, determined, by, each, system, s, own, structure, on, an, individualistic, level, what, this, means, is, that, human, beings, as, free, and, independent, entities, are, triggered, to, react, by, external, stimuli, or, change, in, circumstance, however, their, own, internal, state, and, existing, physical, and, mental, capacities, determine, their, responses, to, those, triggers, on, a, much, broader, societal, level, structural, determinists, believe, that, larger, issues, in, the, society, especially, those, pertaining, to, minorities, and, subjugated, communities, are, predominantly, assessed, through, existing, structural, conditions, making, change, of, prevailing, conditions, difficult, and, sometimes, outright, impossible, for, example, the, concept, has, been, applied, to, the, politics, of, race, in, the, united, states, of, america, and, other, western, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, and, australia, with, structural, determinists, lamenting, structural, factors, for, the, prevalence, of, racism, in, these, countries, additionally, marxists, have, conceptualized, the, writings, of, karl, marx, within, the, context, of, structural, determinism, as, well, for, example, louis, althusser, a, structural, marxist, argues, that, the, state, in, its, political, economic, and, legal, structures, reproduces, the, discourse, of, capitalism, in, turn, allowing, for, the, burgeoning, of, capitalistic, structures, proponents, of, the, notion, highlight, the, usefulness, of, structural, determinism, to, study, complicated, issues, related, to, race, and, gender, as, it, highlights, often, gilded, structural, conditions, that, block, meaningful, change, critics, call, it, too, rigid, reductionist, and, inflexible, additionally, they, also, criticize, the, notion, for, overemphasizing, deterministic, forces, such, as, structure, over, the, role, of, human, agency, and, the, ability, of, the, people, to, act, these, critics, argue, that, politicians, academics, and, social, activists, have, the, capability, to, bring, about, significant, change, despite, stringent, structural, conditions, philosophers, have, debated, both, the, truth, of, determinism, and, the, truth, of, free, will, this, creates, the, four, possible, positions, in, the, figure, compatibilism, refers, to, the, view, that, free, will, is, in, some, sense, compatible, with, determinism, the, three, incompatibilist, positions, deny, this, possibility, the, hard, incompatibilists, hold, that, free, will, is, incompatible, with, both, determinism, and, indeterminism, the, libertarians, that, determinism, does, not, hold, and, free, will, might, exist, and, the, hard, determinists, that, determinism, does, hold, and, free, will, does, not, exist, the, dutch, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, was, a, determinist, thinker, and, argued, that, human, freedom, can, be, achieved, through, knowledge, of, the, causes, that, determine, desire, and, affections, he, defined, human, servitude, as, the, state, of, bondage, of, anyone, who, is, aware, of, their, own, desires, but, ignorant, of, the, causes, that, determined, them, however, the, free, or, virtuous, person, becomes, capable, through, reason, and, knowledge, to, be, genuinely, free, even, as, they, are, being, determined, for, the, dutch, philosopher, acting, out, of, one, s, own, internal, necessity, is, genuine, freedom, while, being, driven, by, exterior, determinations, is, akin, to, bondage, spinoza, s, thoughts, on, human, servitude, and, liberty, are, respectively, detailed, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, volumes, of, his, work, ethics, the, standard, argument, against, free, will, according, to, philosopher, j, j, c, smart, focuses, on, the, implications, of, determinism, for, free, will, he, suggests, free, will, is, denied, whether, determinism, is, true, or, not, he, says, that, if, determinism, is, true, all, actions, are, predicted, and, no, one, is, assumed, to, be, free, however, if, determinism, is, false, all, actions, are, presumed, to, be, random, and, as, such, no, one, seems, free, because, they, have, no, part, in, controlling, what, happens, some, determinists, argue, that, materialism, does, not, present, a, complete, understanding, of, the, universe, because, while, it, can, describe, determinate, interactions, among, material, things, it, ignores, the, minds, or, souls, of, conscious, beings, a, number, of, positions, can, be, delineated, another, topic, of, debate, is, the, implication, that, determinism, has, on, morality, philosopher, and, incompatibilist, peter, van, inwagen, introduced, this, thesis, when, arguments, that, free, will, is, required, for, moral, judgments, as, such, determinism, was, developed, by, the, greek, philosophers, during, the, 7th, and, 6th, centuries, bce, by, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, heraclitus, and, leucippus, later, aristotle, and, mainly, by, the, stoics, some, of, the, main, philosophers, who, have, dealt, with, this, issue, are, marcus, aurelius, omar, khayyam, thomas, hobbes, baruch, spinoza, gottfried, leibniz, david, hume, baron, d, holbach, paul, heinrich, dietrich, pierre, simon, laplace, arthur, schopenhauer, william, james, friedrich, nietzsche, albert, einstein, niels, bohr, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, more, recently, john, searle, ted, honderich, and, daniel, dennett, mecca, chiesa, notes, that, the, probabilistic, or, selectionistic, determinism, of, b, f, skinner, comprised, a, wholly, separate, conception, of, determinism, that, was, not, mechanistic, at, all, mechanistic, determinism, assumes, that, every, event, has, an, unbroken, chain, of, prior, occurrences, but, a, selectionistic, or, probabilistic, model, does, not, in, the, west, some, elements, of, determinism, have, been, expressed, in, greece, from, the, 6th, century, bce, by, the, presocratics, heraclitus, and, leucippus, the, first, notions, of, determinism, appears, to, originate, with, the, stoics, as, part, of, their, theory, of, universal, causal, determinism, the, resulting, philosophical, debates, which, involved, the, confluence, of, elements, of, aristotelian, ethics, with, stoic, psychology, led, in, the, 1st, 3rd, centuries, ce, in, the, works, of, alexander, of, aphrodisias, to, the, first, recorded, western, debate, over, determinism, and, freedom, an, issue, that, is, known, in, theology, as, the, paradox, of, free, will, the, writings, of, epictetus, as, well, as, middle, platonist, and, early, christian, thought, were, instrumental, in, this, development, jewish, philosopher, moses, maimonides, said, of, the, deterministic, implications, of, an, omniscient, god, does, god, know, or, does, he, not, know, that, a, certain, individual, will, be, good, or, bad, if, thou, sayest, he, knows, then, it, necessarily, follows, that, man, is, compelled, to, act, as, god, knew, beforehand, he, would, act, otherwise, god, s, knowledge, would, be, imperfect, determinism, in, the, west, is, often, associated, with, newtonian, mechanics, physics, which, depicts, the, physical, matter, of, the, universe, as, operating, according, to, a, set, of, fixed, laws, the, billiard, ball, hypothesis, a, product, of, newtonian, physics, argues, that, once, the, initial, conditions, of, the, universe, have, been, established, the, rest, of, the, history, of, the, universe, follows, inevitably, if, it, were, actually, possible, to, have, complete, knowledge, of, physical, matter, and, all, of, the, laws, governing, that, matter, at, any, one, time, then, it, would, be, theoretically, possible, to, compute, the, time, and, place, of, every, event, that, will, ever, occur, laplace, s, demon, in, this, sense, the, basic, particles, of, the, universe, operate, in, the, same, fashion, as, the, rolling, balls, on, a, billiard, table, moving, and, striking, each, other, in, predictable, ways, to, produce, predictable, results, whether, or, not, it, is, all, encompassing, in, so, doing, newtonian, mechanics, deals, only, with, caused, events, for, example, if, an, object, begins, in, a, known, position, and, is, hit, dead, on, by, an, object, with, some, known, velocity, then, it, will, be, pushed, straight, toward, another, predictable, point, if, it, goes, somewhere, else, the, newtonians, argue, one, must, question, one, s, measurements, of, the, original, position, of, the, object, the, exact, direction, of, the, striking, object, gravitational, or, other, fields, that, were, inadvertently, ignored, etc, then, they, maintain, repeated, experiments, and, improvements, in, accuracy, will, always, bring, one, s, observations, closer, to, the, theoretically, predicted, results, when, dealing, with, situations, on, an, ordinary, human, scale, newtonian, physics, has, been, successful, but, it, fails, as, velocities, become, some, substantial, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, and, when, interactions, at, the, atomic, scale, are, studied, before, the, discovery, of, quantum, effects, and, other, challenges, to, newtonian, physics, uncertainty, was, always, a, term, that, applied, to, the, accuracy, of, human, knowledge, about, causes, and, effects, and, not, to, the, causes, and, effects, themselves, newtonian, mechanics, as, well, as, any, following, physical, theories, are, results, of, observations, and, experiments, and, so, they, describe, how, it, all, works, within, a, tolerance, however, old, western, scientists, believed, if, there, are, any, logical, connections, found, between, an, observed, cause, and, effect, there, must, be, also, some, absolute, natural, laws, behind, belief, in, perfect, natural, laws, driving, everything, instead, of, just, describing, what, we, should, expect, led, to, searching, for, a, set, of, universal, simple, laws, that, rule, the, world, this, movement, significantly, encouraged, deterministic, views, in, western, philosophy, as, well, as, the, related, theological, views, of, classical, pantheism, throughout, history, the, belief, that, the, entire, universe, is, a, deterministic, system, subject, to, the, will, of, fate, or, destiny, has, been, articulated, in, both, eastern, and, western, religions, philosophy, music, and, literature, the, ancient, arabs, that, inhabited, the, arabian, peninsula, before, the, advent, of, islam, used, to, profess, a, widespread, belief, in, fatalism, adar, alongside, a, fearful, consideration, for, the, sky, and, the, stars, as, divine, beings, which, they, held, to, be, ultimately, responsible, for, every, phenomena, that, occurs, on, earth, and, for, the, destiny, of, humankind, accordingly, they, shaped, their, entire, lives, in, accordance, with, their, interpretations, of, astral, configurations, and, phenomena, in, the, i, ching, and, philosophical, taoism, the, ebb, and, flow, of, favorable, and, unfavorable, conditions, suggests, the, path, of, least, resistance, is, effortless, see, wu, wei, in, the, philosophical, schools, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, concept, of, karma, deals, with, similar, philosophical, issues, to, the, western, concept, of, determinism, karma, is, understood, as, a, spiritual, mechanism, which, causes, the, eternal, cycle, of, birth, death, and, rebirth, sa, s, ra, karma, either, positive, or, negative, accumulates, according, to, an, individual, s, actions, throughout, their, life, and, at, their, death, determines, the, nature, of, their, next, life, in, the, cycle, of, sa, s, ra, most, major, religions, originating, in, india, hold, this, belief, to, some, degree, most, notably, hinduism, jainism, sikhism, and, buddhism, the, views, on, the, interaction, of, karma, and, free, will, are, numerous, and, diverge, from, each, other, for, example, in, sikhism, god, s, grace, gained, through, worship, can, erase, one, s, karmic, debts, a, belief, which, reconciles, the, principle, of, karma, with, a, monotheistic, god, one, must, freely, choose, to, worship, jainists, believe, in, compatibilism, in, which, the, cycle, of, sa, sara, is, a, completely, mechanistic, process, occurring, without, any, divine, intervention, the, jains, hold, an, atomic, view, of, reality, in, which, particles, of, karma, form, the, fundamental, microscopic, building, material, of, the, universe, in, ancient, india, the, j, vika, school, of, philosophy, founded, by, makkhali, gos, la, around, 500, bce, otherwise, referred, to, as, j, vikism, in, western, scholarship, upheld, the, niyati, fate, doctrine, of, absolute, fatalism, or, determinism, which, negates, the, existence, of, free, will, and, karma, and, is, therefore, considered, one, of, the, n, stika, or, heterodox, schools, of, indian, philosophy, the, oldest, descriptions, of, the, j, vika, fatalists, and, their, founder, gos, la, can, be, found, both, in, the, buddhist, and, jaina, scriptures, of, ancient, india, the, predetermined, fate, of, all, sentient, beings, and, the, impossibility, to, achieve, liberation, mok, a, from, the, eternal, cycle, of, birth, death, and, rebirth, sa, s, ra, was, the, major, distinctive, philosophical, and, metaphysical, doctrine, of, this, heterodox, school, of, indian, philosophy, annoverated, among, the, other, rama, a, movements, that, emerged, in, india, during, the, second, urbanization, 600, 200, bce, religion, portal, buddhist, philosophy, contains, several, concepts, which, some, scholars, describe, as, deterministic, to, various, levels, however, the, direct, analysis, of, buddhist, metaphysics, through, the, lens, of, determinism, is, difficult, due, to, the, differences, between, european, and, buddhist, traditions, of, thought, one, concept, which, is, argued, to, support, a, hard, determinism, is, the, doctrine, of, dependent, origination, prat, tyasamutp, da, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, which, states, that, all, phenomena, dharma, are, necessarily, caused, by, some, other, phenomenon, which, it, can, be, said, to, be, dependent, on, like, links, in, a, massive, never, ending, chain, the, basic, principle, is, that, all, things, dharmas, phenomena, principles, arise, in, dependence, upon, other, things, which, means, that, they, are, fundamentally, empty, or, devoid, of, any, intrinsic, eternal, essence, and, therefore, are, impermanent, in, traditional, buddhist, philosophy, this, concept, is, used, to, explain, the, functioning, of, the, eternal, cycle, of, birth, death, and, rebirth, sa, s, ra, all, thoughts, and, actions, exert, a, karmic, force, that, attaches, to, the, individual, s, consciousness, which, will, manifest, through, reincarnation, and, results, in, future, lives, in, other, words, righteous, or, unrighteous, actions, in, one, life, will, necessarily, cause, good, or, bad, responses, in, another, future, life, or, more, lives, the, early, buddhist, texts, and, later, tibetan, buddhist, scriptures, associate, dependent, arising, with, the, fundamental, buddhist, doctrines, of, emptiness, nyat, and, non, self, anatt, another, buddhist, concept, which, many, scholars, perceive, to, be, deterministic, is, the, doctrine, of, non, self, anatt, in, buddhism, attaining, enlightenment, involves, one, realizing, that, neither, in, humans, nor, any, other, sentient, beings, there, is, a, fundamental, core, of, permanent, being, identity, or, personality, which, can, be, called, the, soul, and, that, all, sentient, beings, including, humans, are, instead, made, of, several, constantly, changing, factors, which, bind, them, to, the, eternal, cycle, of, birth, death, and, rebirth, sa, s, ra, sentient, beings, are, composed, of, the, five, aggregates, of, existence, skandha, matter, sensation, perception, mental, formations, and, consciousness, in, the, sa, yutta, nik, ya, of, the, p, li, canon, the, historical, buddha, is, recorded, as, saying, that, just, as, the, word, chariot, exists, on, the, basis, of, the, aggregation, of, parts, even, so, the, concept, of, being, exists, when, the, five, aggregates, are, available, the, early, buddhist, texts, outline, different, ways, in, which, dependent, origination, is, a, middle, way, between, different, sets, of, extreme, views, such, as, monist, and, pluralist, ontologies, or, materialist, and, dualist, views, of, mind, body, relation, in, the, kacc, nagotta, sutta, of, the, p, li, canon, sn, 12, 15, parallel, at, sa, 301, the, historical, buddha, stated, that, this, world, mostly, relies, on, the, dual, notions, of, existence, and, non, existence, and, then, explains, the, right, view, as, follows, but, when, you, truly, see, the, origin, of, the, world, with, right, understanding, you, won, t, have, the, notion, of, non, existence, regarding, the, world, and, when, you, truly, see, the, cessation, of, the, world, with, right, understanding, you, won, t, have, the, notion, of, existence, regarding, the, world, some, scholars, argue, that, the, concept, of, non, self, necessarily, disproves, the, ideas, of, free, will, and, moral, responsibility, if, there, is, no, autonomous, self, in, this, view, and, all, events, are, necessarily, and, unchangeably, caused, by, others, then, no, type, of, autonomy, can, be, said, to, exist, moral, or, otherwise, however, other, scholars, disagree, claiming, that, the, buddhist, conception, of, the, universe, allows, for, a, form, of, compatibilism, buddhism, perceives, reality, occurring, on, two, different, levels, the, ultimate, reality, which, can, only, be, truly, understood, by, the, enlightened, ones, and, the, illusory, or, false, reality, of, the, material, world, which, is, considered, to, be, real, or, true, by, those, who, still, haven, t, achieved, enlightenment, therefore, buddhism, perceives, free, will, as, a, notion, belonging, to, the, illusory, belief, in, the, unchanging, self, or, personhood, that, pertains, to, the, false, reality, or, material, world, while, concepts, like, non, self, and, dependent, origination, belong, to, the, ultimate, reality, the, transition, between, the, two, can, be, truly, understood, buddhists, claim, by, one, who, has, attained, enlightenment, although, it, was, once, thought, by, scientists, that, any, indeterminism, in, quantum, mechanics, occurred, at, too, small, a, scale, to, influence, biological, or, neurological, systems, there, is, indication, that, nervous, systems, are, influenced, by, quantum, indeterminism, due, to, chaos, theory, it, is, unclear, what, implications, this, has, for, the, problem, of, free, will, given, various, possible, reactions, to, the, problem, in, the, first, place, many, biologists, do, not, grant, determinism, christof, koch, for, instance, argues, against, it, and, in, favour, of, libertarian, free, will, by, making, arguments, based, on, generative, processes, emergence, other, proponents, of, emergentist, or, generative, philosophy, cognitive, sciences, and, evolutionary, psychology, argue, that, a, certain, form, of, determinism, not, necessarily, causal, is, true, they, suggest, instead, that, an, illusion, of, free, will, is, experienced, due, to, the, generation, of, infinite, behaviour, from, the, interaction, of, finite, deterministic, set, of, rules, and, parameters, thus, the, unpredictability, of, the, emerging, behaviour, from, deterministic, processes, leads, to, a, perception, of, free, will, even, though, free, will, as, an, ontological, entity, does, not, exist, as, an, illustration, the, strategy, board, games, chess, and, go, have, rigorous, rules, in, which, no, information, such, as, cards, face, values, is, hidden, from, either, player, and, no, random, events, such, as, dice, rolling, happen, within, the, game, yet, chess, and, especially, go, with, its, extremely, simple, deterministic, rules, can, still, have, an, extremely, large, number, of, unpredictable, moves, when, chess, is, simplified, to, 7, or, fewer, pieces, however, endgame, tables, are, available, that, dictate, which, moves, to, play, to, achieve, a, perfect, game, this, implies, that, given, a, less, complex, environment, with, the, original, 32, pieces, reduced, to, 7, or, fewer, pieces, a, perfectly, predictable, game, of, chess, is, possible, in, this, scenario, the, winning, player, can, announce, that, a, checkmate, will, happen, within, a, given, number, of, moves, assuming, a, perfect, defense, by, the, losing, player, or, fewer, moves, if, the, defending, player, chooses, sub, optimal, moves, as, the, game, progresses, into, its, inevitable, predicted, conclusion, by, this, analogy, it, is, suggested, the, experience, of, free, will, emerges, from, the, interaction, of, finite, rules, and, deterministic, parameters, that, generate, nearly, infinite, and, practically, unpredictable, behavioural, responses, in, theory, if, all, these, events, could, be, accounted, for, and, there, were, a, known, way, to, evaluate, these, events, the, seemingly, unpredictable, behaviour, would, become, predictable, another, hands, on, example, of, generative, processes, is, john, horton, conway, s, playable, game, of, life, nassim, taleb, is, wary, of, such, models, and, coined, the, term, ludic, fallacy, certain, philosophers, of, science, argue, that, while, causal, determinism, in, which, everything, including, the, brain, mind, is, subject, to, the, laws, of, causality, is, compatible, with, minds, capable, of, science, fatalism, and, predestination, is, not, these, philosophers, make, the, distinction, that, causal, determinism, means, that, each, step, is, determined, by, the, step, before, and, therefore, allows, sensory, input, from, observational, data, to, determine, what, conclusions, the, brain, reaches, while, fatalism, in, which, the, steps, between, do, not, connect, an, initial, cause, to, the, results, would, make, it, impossible, for, observational, data, to, correct, false, hypotheses, this, is, often, combined, with, the, argument, that, if, the, brain, had, fixed, views, and, the, arguments, were, mere, after, constructs, with, no, causal, effect, on, the, conclusions, science, would, have, been, impossible, and, the, use, of, arguments, would, have, been, a, meaningless, waste, of, energy, with, no, persuasive, effect, on, brains, with, fixed, views, many, mathematical, models, of, physical, systems, are, deterministic, this, is, true, of, most, models, involving, differential, equations, notably, those, measuring, rate, of, change, over, time, mathematical, models, that, are, not, deterministic, because, they, involve, randomness, are, called, stochastic, because, of, sensitive, dependence, on, initial, conditions, some, deterministic, models, may, appear, to, behave, non, deterministically, in, such, cases, a, deterministic, interpretation, of, the, model, may, not, be, useful, due, to, numerical, instability, and, a, finite, amount, of, precision, in, measurement, such, considerations, can, motivate, the, consideration, of, a, stochastic, model, even, though, the, underlying, system, is, governed, by, deterministic, equations, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, quantum, mechanics, the, physics, of, the, extremely, small, has, revealed, previously, concealed, aspects, of, events, before, that, newtonian, physics, the, physics, of, everyday, life, dominated, taken, in, isolation, rather, than, as, an, approximation, to, quantum, mechanics, newtonian, physics, depicts, a, universe, in, which, objects, move, in, perfectly, determined, ways, at, the, scale, where, humans, exist, and, interact, with, the, universe, newtonian, mechanics, remain, useful, and, make, relatively, accurate, predictions, e, g, calculating, the, trajectory, of, a, bullet, but, whereas, in, theory, absolute, knowledge, of, the, forces, accelerating, a, bullet, would, produce, an, absolutely, accurate, prediction, of, its, path, modern, quantum, mechanics, casts, reasonable, doubt, on, this, main, thesis, of, determinism, quantum, physics, works, differently, in, many, ways, from, newtonian, physics, physicist, aaron, d, o, connell, explains, that, understanding, the, universe, at, such, small, scales, as, atoms, requires, a, different, logic, than, day, to, day, life, does, o, connell, does, not, deny, that, it, is, all, interconnected, the, scale, of, human, existence, ultimately, does, emerge, from, the, quantum, scale, o, connell, argues, that, we, must, simply, use, different, models, and, constructs, when, dealing, with, the, quantum, world, quantum, mechanics, is, the, product, of, a, careful, application, of, the, scientific, method, logic, and, empiricism, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, is, frequently, confused, with, the, observer, effect, the, uncertainty, principle, actually, describes, how, precisely, we, may, measure, the, position, and, momentum, of, a, particle, at, the, same, time, if, we, increase, the, accuracy, in, measuring, one, quantity, we, are, forced, to, lose, accuracy, in, measuring, the, other, these, uncertainty, relations, give, us, that, measure, of, freedom, from, the, limitations, of, classical, concepts, which, is, necessary, for, a, consistent, description, of, atomic, processes, this, is, where, statistical, mechanics, come, into, play, and, where, physicists, begin, to, require, rather, unintuitive, mental, models, a, particle, s, path, simply, cannot, be, exactly, specified, in, its, full, quantum, description, path, is, a, classical, practical, attribute, in, everyday, life, but, one, that, quantum, particles, do, not, meaningfully, possess, the, probabilities, discovered, in, quantum, mechanics, do, nevertheless, arise, from, measurement, of, the, perceived, path, of, the, particle, as, stephen, hawking, explains, the, result, is, not, traditional, determinism, but, rather, determined, probabilities, in, some, cases, a, quantum, particle, may, indeed, trace, an, exact, path, and, the, probability, of, finding, the, particles, in, that, path, is, one, certain, to, be, true, in, fact, as, far, as, prediction, goes, the, quantum, development, is, at, least, as, predictable, as, the, classical, motion, but, the, key, is, that, it, describes, wave, functions, that, cannot, be, easily, expressed, in, ordinary, language, as, far, as, the, thesis, of, determinism, is, concerned, these, probabilities, at, least, are, quite, determined, these, findings, from, quantum, mechanics, have, found, many, applications, and, allow, people, to, build, transistors, and, lasers, put, another, way, personal, computers, blu, ray, players, and, the, internet, all, work, because, humankind, discovered, the, determined, probabilities, of, the, quantum, world, on, the, topic, of, predictable, probabilities, the, double, slit, experiments, are, a, popular, example, photons, are, fired, one, by, one, through, a, double, slit, apparatus, at, a, distant, screen, they, do, not, arrive, at, any, single, point, nor, even, the, two, points, lined, up, with, the, slits, the, way, it, might, be, expected, of, bullets, fired, by, a, fixed, gun, at, a, distant, target, instead, the, light, arrives, in, varying, concentrations, at, widely, separated, points, and, the, distribution, of, its, collisions, with, the, target, can, be, calculated, reliably, in, that, sense, the, behavior, of, light, in, this, apparatus, is, predictable, but, there, is, no, way, to, predict, where, in, the, resulting, interference, pattern, any, individual, photon, will, make, its, contribution, although, there, may, be, ways, to, use, weak, measurement, to, acquire, more, information, without, violating, the, uncertainty, principle, some, including, albert, einstein, have, argued, that, the, inability, to, predict, any, more, than, probabilities, is, simply, due, to, ignorance, the, idea, is, that, beyond, the, conditions, and, laws, can, be, observed, or, deduced, there, are, also, hidden, factors, or, hidden, variables, that, determine, absolutely, in, which, order, photons, reach, the, detector, screen, they, argue, that, the, course, of, the, universe, is, absolutely, determined, but, that, humans, are, screened, from, knowledge, of, the, determinative, factors, so, they, say, it, only, appears, that, things, proceed, in, a, merely, probabilistically, determinative, way, in, actuality, they, proceed, in, an, absolutely, deterministic, way, john, s, bell, criticized, einstein, s, work, in, his, famous, bell, s, theorem, which, under, a, strict, set, of, assumptions, demonstrates, that, quantum, mechanics, can, make, statistical, predictions, that, would, be, violated, if, local, hidden, variables, really, existed, a, number, of, experiments, have, tried, to, verify, such, predictions, and, so, far, they, do, not, appear, to, be, violated, current, experiments, continue, to, verify, the, result, including, the, 2015, loophole, free, test, that, plugged, all, known, sources, of, error, and, the, 2017, cosmic, bell, test, experiment, that, used, cosmic, data, streaming, from, different, directions, toward, the, earth, precluding, the, possibility, the, sources, of, data, could, have, had, prior, interactions, bell, s, theorem, has, been, criticized, from, the, perspective, of, its, strict, set, of, assumptions, a, foundational, assumption, to, quantum, mechanics, is, the, principle, of, locality, to, abandon, this, assumption, would, require, the, construction, of, a, non, local, hidden, variable, theory, therefore, it, is, possible, to, augment, quantum, mechanics, with, non, local, hidden, variables, to, achieve, a, deterministic, theory, that, is, in, agreement, with, experiment, an, example, is, the, bohm, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, bohm, s, interpretation, though, violates, special, relativity, and, it, is, highly, controversial, whether, or, not, it, can, be, reconciled, without, giving, up, on, determinism, another, foundational, assumption, to, quantum, mechanics, is, that, of, free, will, which, has, been, argued, to, be, foundational, to, the, scientific, method, as, a, whole, bell, acknowledged, that, abandoning, this, assumption, would, both, allow, for, the, maintenance, of, determinism, as, well, as, locality, this, perspective, is, known, as, superdeterminism, and, is, defended, by, some, physicists, such, as, sabine, hossenfelder, and, tim, palmer, more, advanced, variations, on, these, arguments, include, quantum, contextuality, by, bell, simon, b, kochen, and, ernst, specker, which, argues, that, hidden, variable, theories, cannot, be, sensible, meaning, that, the, values, of, the, hidden, variables, inherently, depend, on, the, devices, used, to, measure, them, this, debate, is, relevant, because, there, are, possibly, specific, situations, in, which, the, arrival, of, an, electron, at, a, screen, at, a, certain, point, and, time, would, trigger, one, event, whereas, its, arrival, at, another, point, would, trigger, an, entirely, different, event, e, g, see, schr, dinger, s, cat, a, thought, experiment, used, as, part, of, a, deeper, debate, in, his, 1939, address, the, relation, between, mathematics, and, physics, paul, dirac, points, out, that, purely, deterministic, classical, mechanics, cannot, explain, the, cosmological, origins, of, the, universe, today, the, early, universe, is, modeled, quantum, mechanically, thus, quantum, physics, casts, reasonable, doubt, on, the, traditional, determinism, of, classical, newtonian, physics, in, so, far, as, reality, does, not, seem, to, be, absolutely, determined, this, was, the, subject, of, the, famous, bohr, einstein, debates, between, einstein, and, niels, bohr, and, there, is, still, no, consensus, adequate, determinism, see, varieties, above, is, the, reason, that, stephen, hawking, called, libertarian, free, will, just, an, illusion
