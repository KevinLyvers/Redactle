https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism
polytheism, is, the, belief, in, or, worship, of, more, than, one, god, according, to, oxford, reference, it, is, not, easy, to, count, gods, and, so, not, always, obvious, whether, an, apparently, polytheistic, religion, such, as, chinese, folk, religions, is, really, so, or, whether, the, apparent, different, objects, of, worship, are, to, be, thought, of, as, manifestations, of, a, singular, divinity, polytheistic, belief, is, usually, assembled, into, a, pantheon, of, gods, and, goddesses, along, with, their, own, religious, sects, and, rituals, polytheism, is, a, type, of, theism, within, theism, it, contrasts, with, monotheism, the, belief, in, a, singular, god, who, is, in, most, cases, transcendent, in, religions, that, accept, polytheism, the, different, gods, and, goddesses, may, be, representations, of, forces, of, nature, or, ancestral, principles, they, can, be, viewed, either, as, autonomous, or, as, aspects, or, emanations, of, a, creator, deity, or, transcendental, absolute, principle, monistic, theologies, which, manifests, immanently, in, nature, panentheistic, and, pantheistic, theologies, polytheists, do, not, always, worship, all, the, gods, equally, they, can, be, in, monolatrists, or, kathenotheists, specializing, in, the, worship, of, one, particular, deity, only, or, at, certain, times, respectively, the, recognition, of, the, existence, of, multiple, gods, and, goddesses, does, not, necessarily, equate, to, the, worship, of, all, the, deities, of, one, or, more, pantheons, as, the, believer, can, either, worship, them, as, a, whole, or, concentrate, only, on, a, specific, group, of, deities, determined, by, various, conditions, such, as, the, believer, s, occupation, tastes, personal, experience, family, tradition, etc, it, is, also, possible, to, worship, a, single, deity, considered, supreme, without, ruling, out, the, existence, of, other, gods, this, religious, position, has, been, called, henotheism, but, some, prefer, to, call, it, monolatry, although, the, term, henotheism, is, controversial, it, is, recognized, by, scholars, that, the, worship, of, a, single, god, accompanied, by, belief, in, other, deities, maintains, the, principle, of, polytheism, polytheism, was, the, typical, form, of, religion, before, the, development, and, spread, of, the, abrahamic, religions, of, judaism, christianity, and, islam, which, enforce, monotheism, it, is, well, documented, throughout, history, from, prehistory, and, the, earliest, records, of, ancient, egyptian, religion, and, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, to, the, religions, prevalent, during, classical, antiquity, such, as, ancient, greek, religion, and, ancient, roman, religion, and, in, ethnic, religions, such, as, germanic, slavic, and, baltic, paganism, and, native, american, religions, notable, polytheistic, religions, practiced, today, include, taoism, hellenism, modern, religion, shenism, or, chinese, folk, religion, many, schools, of, hinduism, shinto, santer, a, most, traditional, african, religions, and, various, neopagan, faiths, such, as, wicca, hinduism, while, popularly, held, as, polytheistic, by, many, scholars, cannot, be, exclusively, categorised, as, such, as, some, hindus, consider, themselves, to, be, pantheists, panentheists, henotheist, polymorphist, monotheists, or, monist, hinduism, does, not, have, a, single, book, hinduism, is, an, umbrella, term, for, a, collection, of, ideologies, they, are, compatible, with, hindu, texts, since, there, exists, no, consensus, of, standardisation, in, the, faith, vedanta, the, most, dominant, school, of, hinduism, offers, a, combination, of, pantheism, panentheism, and, polytheism, holding, that, brahman, is, the, sole, ultimate, reality, of, the, universe, yet, unity, with, it, can, be, reached, by, worshipping, the, innumerable, deities, that, represent, the, supreme, absolute, truth, hindus, who, practice, bhakti, ultimately, believe, in, one, god, who, is, known, variously, as, paramatman, parabrahman, bhagavan, ishvara, and, so, on, that, transcends, all, categories, e, g, both, of, form, and, formless, however, the, common, people, who, remain, unaware, of, these, concepts, worship, their, deities, as, ultimate, god, different, provinces, worship, their, own, god, whose, worship, is, restricted, to, that, region, the, concept, of, supreme, god, came, with, advent, of, abrahamic, religions, and, colonialism, in, mediaeval, and, modern, times, as, hinduism, is, one, of, those, religions, which, has, survived, foreign, ideologies, and, colonial, power, many, polytheistic, schools, of, hinduism, have, absorbed, these, ideas, of, monotheism, bramhan, is, personification, of, the, concept, of, moksha, and, the, different, gods, are, paths, to, moksha, or, realising, the, brahman, the, term, comes, from, the, greek, poly, many, and, theos, god, and, was, coined, by, the, jewish, writer, philo, of, alexandria, to, argue, with, the, greeks, when, christianity, spread, throughout, europe, and, the, mediterranean, non, christians, were, just, called, gentiles, a, term, originally, used, by, jews, to, refer, to, non, jews, or, pagans, locals, or, by, the, clearly, pejorative, term, idolaters, worshippers, of, false, gods, in, modern, times, the, term, polytheism, was, first, revived, in, french, by, jean, bodin, in, 1580, followed, by, samuel, purchas, s, usage, in, english, in, 1614, a, major, division, in, modern, polytheistic, practices, is, between, so, called, soft, polytheism, and, hard, polytheism, soft, polytheism, is, the, belief, that, different, gods, may, either, be, psychological, archetypes, personifications, of, natural, forces, or, as, being, one, essential, god, interpreted, through, the, lenses, of, different, cultures, e, g, odin, zeus, and, indra, all, being, the, same, god, as, interpreted, by, germanic, greek, and, indic, peoples, respectively, known, as, omnitheism, in, this, way, gods, may, be, interchangeable, for, one, another, across, cultures, hard, polytheism, is, the, belief, that, gods, are, distinct, separate, real, divine, beings, rather, than, psychological, archetypes, or, personifications, of, natural, forces, hard, polytheists, reject, the, idea, that, all, gods, are, one, essential, god, and, may, also, reject, the, existence, of, gods, outside, their, own, pantheon, altogether, the, deities, of, polytheism, are, often, portrayed, as, complex, personages, of, greater, or, lesser, status, with, individual, skills, needs, desires, and, histories, in, many, ways, similar, to, humans, anthropomorphic, in, their, personality, traits, but, with, additional, individual, powers, abilities, knowledge, or, perceptions, polytheism, cannot, be, cleanly, separated, from, the, animist, beliefs, prevalent, in, most, folk, religions, the, gods, of, polytheism, are, in, many, cases, the, highest, order, of, a, continuum, of, supernatural, beings, or, spirits, which, may, include, ancestors, demons, wights, and, others, in, some, cases, these, spirits, are, divided, into, celestial, or, chthonic, classes, and, belief, in, the, existence, of, all, these, beings, does, not, imply, that, all, are, worshipped, types, of, deities, often, found, in, polytheism, may, include, in, the, classical, era, 4th, century, ce, neoplatonist, sallustius, categorized, mythology, into, five, types, the, beliefs, of, many, historical, polytheistic, religions, are, commonly, referred, to, as, mythology, though, the, stories, cultures, tell, about, their, gods, should, be, distinguished, from, their, worship, or, religious, practice, for, instance, deities, portrayed, in, conflict, in, mythology, were, often, nonetheless, worshipped, side, by, side, illustrating, the, distinction, within, the, religion, between, belief, and, practice, scholars, such, as, jaan, puhvel, j, p, mallory, and, douglas, q, adams, have, reconstructed, aspects, of, the, ancient, proto, indo, european, religion, from, which, the, religions, of, the, various, indo, european, peoples, are, thought, to, derive, which, is, believed, to, have, been, an, essentially, naturalist, numenistic, religion, an, example, of, a, religious, notion, from, this, shared, past, is, the, concept, of, dy, us, which, is, attested, in, several, religious, systems, of, indo, european, speaking, peoples, well, known, historical, polytheistic, pantheons, include, the, sumerian, gods, the, egyptian, gods, the, pantheon, attested, in, classical, antiquity, in, ancient, greek, and, roman, religion, the, norse, sir, and, vanir, the, yoruba, orisha, and, the, aztec, gods, in, many, civilizations, pantheons, tended, to, grow, over, time, deities, first, worshipped, as, the, patrons, of, cities, or, other, places, came, to, be, collected, together, as, empires, extended, over, larger, territories, conquests, could, lead, to, the, subordination, of, a, culture, s, pantheon, to, that, of, the, invaders, as, in, the, greek, titanomachia, and, possibly, also, the, sir, vanir, war, in, the, norse, mythos, cultural, exchange, could, lead, to, the, same, deity, being, revered, in, two, places, under, different, names, as, seen, with, the, greeks, etruscans, and, romans, and, also, to, the, cultural, transmission, of, elements, of, an, extraneous, religion, as, with, the, ancient, egyptian, deity, osiris, who, was, later, worshipped, in, ancient, greece, most, ancient, belief, systems, held, that, gods, influenced, human, lives, however, the, greek, philosopher, epicurus, held, that, the, gods, were, incorruptible, but, material, blissful, beings, who, inhabited, the, empty, spaces, between, worlds, and, did, not, trouble, themselves, with, the, affairs, of, mortals, but, could, be, perceived, by, the, mind, especially, during, sleep, the, classical, scheme, in, ancient, greece, of, the, twelve, olympians, the, canonical, twelve, of, art, and, poetry, were, zeus, hera, poseidon, athena, ares, demeter, apollo, artemis, hephaestus, aphrodite, hermes, and, hestia, though, it, is, suggested, that, hestia, stepped, down, when, dionysus, was, invited, to, mount, olympus, this, is, a, matter, of, controversy, robert, graves, the, greek, myths, cites, two, sources, that, obviously, do, not, suggest, hestia, surrendered, her, seat, though, he, suggests, she, did, hades, was, often, excluded, because, he, dwelt, in, the, underworld, all, of, the, gods, had, a, power, there, was, however, a, great, deal, of, fluidity, as, to, whom, was, counted, among, their, number, in, antiquity, different, cities, often, worshipped, the, same, deities, sometimes, with, epithets, that, distinguished, them, and, specified, their, local, nature, hellenic, polytheism, extended, beyond, mainland, greece, to, the, islands, and, coasts, of, ionia, in, asia, minor, to, magna, graecia, sicily, and, southern, italy, and, to, scattered, greek, colonies, in, the, western, mediterranean, such, as, massalia, marseille, greek, religion, tempered, etruscan, cult, and, belief, to, form, much, of, the, later, roman, religion, during, the, hellenistic, era, philosophical, schools, like, epicureanism, developed, distinct, theologies, hellenism, is, in, practice, primarily, centered, around, polytheistic, and, animistic, worship, the, majority, of, so, called, folk, religions, in, the, world, today, distinguished, from, traditional, ethnic, religions, are, found, in, the, asia, pacific, region, this, fact, conforms, to, the, trend, of, the, majority, of, polytheist, religions, being, found, outside, the, western, world, folk, religions, are, often, closely, tied, to, animism, animistic, beliefs, are, found, in, historical, and, modern, cultures, folk, beliefs, are, often, labeled, superstitions, when, they, are, present, in, monotheistic, societies, folk, religions, often, do, not, have, organized, authorities, also, known, as, priesthoods, or, any, formal, sacred, texts, they, often, coincide, with, other, religions, as, well, abrahamic, monotheistic, religions, which, dominate, the, western, world, typically, do, not, approve, of, practicing, parts, of, multiple, religions, but, folk, religions, often, overlap, with, others, followers, of, polytheistic, religions, do, not, often, problematize, following, practices, and, beliefs, from, multiple, religions, depending, on, the, type, of, buddhism, practiced, it, may, be, seen, as, polytheistic, as, it, at, least, acknowledges, the, existence, of, multiple, gods, the, buddha, is, a, leader, figure, but, is, not, meant, to, be, worshipped, as, a, god, devas, a, sanskrit, word, for, gods, are, also, not, meant, to, be, worshipped, they, are, not, immortal, and, have, limited, powers, they, may, have, been, humans, who, had, positive, karma, in, their, life, and, were, reborn, as, a, deva, a, common, buddhist, practice, is, tantra, which, is, the, use, of, rituals, to, achieve, enlightenment, tantra, focuses, on, seeing, yourself, as, a, deity, and, the, use, of, deities, as, symbols, rather, than, supernatural, agents, buddhism, is, most, closely, aligned, with, polytheism, when, it, is, linked, with, other, religions, often, folk, religions, for, example, the, japanese, shinto, religion, in, which, deities, called, kami, are, worshipped, is, sometimes, mixed, with, buddhism, although, christianity, is, usually, described, as, a, monotheistic, religion, it, is, sometimes, claimed, that, christianity, is, not, truly, monotheistic, because, of, its, idea, of, the, trinity, the, trinity, believes, that, god, consists, of, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, because, the, deity, is, three, persons, some, people, believe, christianity, should, be, considered, a, form, of, tritheism, or, polytheism, christians, contend, that, one, god, exists, in, three, persons, and, one, substance, but, that, a, deity, cannot, be, a, person, who, has, one, individual, identity, christianity, inherited, the, idea, of, one, god, from, judaism, and, maintains, that, its, monotheistic, doctrine, is, central, to, the, faith, jordan, paper, a, western, scholar, and, self, described, polytheist, considers, polytheism, to, be, the, normal, state, in, human, culture, he, argues, that, even, the, catholic, church, shows, polytheistic, aspects, with, the, veneration, of, the, saints, on, the, other, hand, he, complains, monotheistic, missionaries, and, scholars, were, eager, to, see, a, proto, monotheism, or, at, least, henotheism, in, polytheistic, religions, for, example, when, taking, from, the, chinese, pair, of, sky, and, earth, only, one, part, and, calling, it, the, king, of, heaven, as, matteo, ricci, did, in, 1508, a, london, lollard, named, william, pottier, was, accused, of, believing, in, six, gods, joseph, smith, the, founder, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, believed, in, the, plurality, of, gods, saying, i, have, always, declared, god, to, be, a, distinct, personage, jesus, christ, a, separate, and, distinct, personage, from, god, the, father, and, that, the, holy, ghost, was, a, distinct, personage, and, a, spirit, and, these, three, constitute, three, distinct, personages, and, three, gods, mormonism, which, emerged, from, protestantism, teaches, exaltation, defined, as, the, idea, that, people, can, become, like, god, in, the, afterlife, mormonism, also, affirms, the, existence, of, a, heavenly, mother, and, the, prevailing, view, among, mormons, is, that, god, the, father, was, once, a, man, who, lived, on, a, planet, with, his, own, higher, god, and, who, became, perfect, after, following, this, higher, god, some, critics, of, mormonism, argue, that, statements, in, the, book, of, mormon, describe, a, trinitarian, conception, of, god, e, g, 2, nephi, 31, 21, alma, 11, 44, but, were, superseded, by, later, revelations, due, to, teachings, within, mormon, cosmology, some, theologians, claim, that, it, allows, for, an, infinite, number, of, gods, mormons, teach, that, scriptural, statements, on, the, unity, of, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, ghost, represent, a, oneness, of, purpose, not, of, substance, they, believe, that, the, early, christian, church, did, not, characterize, divinity, in, terms, of, an, immaterial, formless, shared, substance, until, post, apostolic, theologians, began, to, incorporate, greek, metaphysical, philosophies, such, as, neoplatonism, into, christian, doctrine, mormons, believe, that, the, truth, about, god, s, nature, was, restored, through, modern, day, revelation, which, reinstated, the, original, judeo, christian, concept, of, a, natural, corporeal, immortal, god, who, is, the, literal, father, of, the, spirits, of, humans, it, is, to, this, personage, alone, that, mormons, pray, as, he, is, and, always, will, be, their, heavenly, father, the, supreme, god, of, gods, deuteronomy, 10, 17, in, the, sense, that, mormons, worship, only, god, the, father, they, consider, themselves, monotheists, nevertheless, mormons, adhere, to, christ, s, teaching, that, those, who, receive, god, s, word, can, obtain, the, title, of, gods, john, 10, 33, 36, because, as, literal, children, of, god, they, can, take, upon, themselves, his, divine, attributes, mormons, teach, that, the, glory, of, god, is, intelligence, doctrine, and, covenants, 93, 36, and, that, it, is, by, sharing, the, father, s, perfect, comprehension, of, all, things, that, both, jesus, christ, and, the, holy, spirit, are, also, divine, hinduism, is, neither, a, monolithic, religion, nor, an, organized, religion, a, wide, variety, of, religious, traditions, and, practices, are, grouped, together, under, this, umbrella, term, and, some, modern, scholars, have, questioned, the, legitimacy, of, unifying, them, artificially, and, suggest, that, one, should, speak, of, hinduisms, in, the, plural, theistic, hinduism, encompasses, both, monotheistic, and, polytheistic, tendencies, and, variations, on, or, mixes, of, both, structures, hindus, venerate, deities, in, the, form, of, the, pratima, or, idol, the, puja, worship, of, the, pratima, is, like, a, way, to, communicate, with, the, formless, abstract, divinity, brahman, in, hinduism, which, creates, sustains, and, dissolves, creation, however, there, are, sects, who, have, advocated, that, there, is, no, need, of, giving, a, shape, to, god, and, that, it, is, omnipresent, and, beyond, the, things, which, human, can, see, or, feel, tangibly, these, gods, were, not, worshipped, without, a, proper, consecration, ritual, it, was, believed, that, after, the, consecration, ritual, the, idol, no, longer, remained, as, stone, or, metal, and, attained, a, temporary, or, permanent, state, of, divinity, some, hindu, philosophers, and, theologians, argue, for, a, transcendent, metaphysical, structure, with, a, single, divine, essence, this, divine, essence, is, usually, referred, to, as, brahman, or, atman, but, the, understanding, of, the, nature, of, this, absolute, divine, essence, is, the, line, which, defines, many, hindu, philosophical, traditions, such, as, vedanta, among, lay, hindus, some, believe, in, different, deities, emanating, from, brahman, while, others, practice, more, traditional, polytheism, and, henotheism, focusing, their, worship, on, one, or, more, personal, deities, while, granting, the, existence, of, others, academically, speaking, the, ancient, vedic, scriptures, upon, which, hinduism, is, derived, describe, four, authorized, disciplic, lines, of, teaching, coming, down, over, thousands, of, years, padma, purana, four, of, them, propound, that, the, absolute, truth, is, fully, personal, as, in, judeo, christian, theology, they, say, that, the, primal, original, god, is, personal, both, transcendent, and, immanent, throughout, creation, he, can, be, and, is, often, approached, through, worship, of, prathimas, called, archa, vigraha, which, are, described, in, the, vedas, as, identical, with, his, various, dynamic, spiritual, forms, this, is, the, vaisnava, theology, the, fifth, disciplic, line, of, vedic, spirituality, founded, by, adi, shankaracharya, promotes, the, concept, that, the, absolute, is, brahman, without, clear, differentiations, without, will, without, thought, without, intelligence, in, the, smarta, denomination, of, hinduism, the, philosophy, of, advaita, expounded, by, shankara, allows, veneration, of, numerous, deities, with, the, understanding, that, all, of, them, are, but, manifestations, of, one, impersonal, divine, power, brahman, therefore, according, to, various, schools, of, vedanta, including, shankara, which, is, the, most, influential, and, important, hindu, theological, tradition, there, are, a, great, number, of, deities, in, hinduism, such, as, vishnu, shiva, ganesha, hanuman, lakshmi, kali, parvati, durga, rama, krishna, but, they, are, essentially, different, forms, of, the, same, being, however, many, vedantic, philosophers, also, argue, that, all, individuals, were, united, by, the, same, impersonal, divine, power, in, the, form, of, the, atman, many, other, hindus, however, view, polytheism, as, far, preferable, to, monotheism, ram, swarup, for, example, points, to, the, vedas, as, being, specifically, polytheistic, and, states, that, only, some, form, of, polytheism, alone, can, do, justice, to, this, variety, and, richness, nasadiya, sukta, hymn, of, non, eternity, origin, of, universe, there, was, neither, non, existence, nor, existence, then, neither, the, realm, of, space, nor, the, sky, which, is, beyond, what,

zoroastrianism, is, henotheistic, and, a, dualistic, and, polytheistic, religion, but, with, one, supreme, god, who, is, the, father, of, the, ordered, cosmos, other, scholars, state, that, this, is, unclear, because, historic, texts, present, a, conflicting, picture, ranging, from, zoroastrianism, s, belief, in, one, god, two, gods, or, a, best, god, henotheism, the, nature, of, tengrism, remains, debatable, according, to, many, scholars, tengrism, was, originally, polytheistic, but, a, monotheistic, branch, with, the, sky, god, k, k, tengri, as, the, supreme, being, evolved, as, a, dynastical, legitimation, it, is, at, least, agreed, that, tengrism, formed, from, the, diverse, folk, religions, of, the, local, people, and, may, have, had, diverse, branches, it, is, suggested, that, tengrism, was, a, monotheistic, religion, only, at, the, imperial, level, in, aristocratic, circles, and, perhaps, only, by, the, 12th, 13th, centuries, a, late, form, of, development, of, ancient, animistic, shamanism, in, the, era, of, the, mongol, empire, according, to, jean, paul, roux, the, monotheistic, concept, evolved, later, out, of, a, polytheistic, system, and, was, not, the, original, form, of, tengrism, the, monotheistic, concept, helped, to, legitimate, the, rule, of, the, dynasty, as, there, is, only, one, god, in, heaven, there, can, only, be, one, ruler, on, the, earth, others, point, out, that, tengri, itself, was, never, an, absolute, but, only, one, of, many, gods, of, the, upper, world, the, sky, deity, of, polytheistic, shamanism, later, known, as, tengrism, the, term, also, describes, several, contemporary, turko, mongolic, native, religious, movements, and, teachings, all, modern, adherents, of, political, tengrism, are, monotheists, modern, paganism, also, known, as, neopaganism, and, contemporary, paganism, is, a, group, of, contemporary, religious, movements, influenced, by, or, claiming, to, be, derived, from, the, various,

polytheists, sharply, differ, from, neopagans, in, that, they, consider, their, religion, not, only, as, inspired, by, historical, religions, but, in, many, cases, as, a, continuation, or, revival, of, those, religions, wicca, is, a, duotheistic, faith, created, by, gerald, gardner, that, allows, for, polytheism, wiccans, specifically, worship, the, lord, and, lady, of, the, isles, their, names,

nature, in, africa, polytheism, in, serer, religion, dates, to, the, neolithic, era, or, possibly, earlier, when, the, ancient, ancestors, of, the, serer, people, represented, their, pangool, on, the, tassili, n, ajjer, the, supreme, creator, deity, in, serer, religion, is, roog, however, there, are, many, deities, and, pangool, singular, fangool, the, interceders, with, the, divine, in, serer, religion, each, one, has, its, own, purpose, and, serves, as, roog, s, agent, on, earth, amongst, the, cangin, speakers, a, sub, group, of, the, serers, roog, is, known, as, koox, the, term, polytheist, is, sometimes, used, by, sunni, muslim, extremist, groups, such, as, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, isil, as, a, derogatory, reference, to, shiite, muslims, whom, they, view, as, having, strayed, from, islam, s, monotheistic, creed, because, of, the, reverence, they, show, for, historical, figures, like, imam, ali, professor, paul, vitz, an, opponent, of, selfism, viewed, america, as, a, most, polytheistic, nation, polydeism, from, the, greek, poly, many, and, latin, deus, meaning, god, is, a, portmanteau, referencing, a, polytheistic, form, of, deism, encompassing, the, belief, that, the, universe, was, the, collective, creation, of, multiple, gods, each, of, whom, created, a, piece, of, the, universe, or, multiverse, and, then, ceased, to, intervene, in, its, evolution, this, concept, addresses, an, apparent, contradiction, in, deism, that, a, monotheistic, god, created, the, universe, but, now, expresses, no, apparent, interest, in, it, by, supposing, that, if, the, universe, is, the, construct, of, many, gods, none, of, them, would, have, an, interest, in, the, universe, as, a, whole, creighton, university, philosophy, professor, william, o, stephens, who, has, taught, this, concept, suggests, that, c, d, broad, projected, this, concept, in, broad, s, 1925, article, the, validity, of, belief, in, a, personal, god, broad, noted, that, the, arguments, for, the, existence, of, god, only, tend, to, prove, that, a, designing, mind, had, existed, in, the, past, not, that, it, does, exist, now, it, is, quite, compatible, with, this, argument, that, god, should, have, died, long, ago, or, that, he, should, have, turned, his, attention, to, other, parts, of, the, universe, and, notes, in, the, same, breath, that, there, is, nothing, in, the, facts, to, suggest, that, there, is, only, one, such, being, stephens, contends, that, broad, in, turn, derived, the, concept, from, david, hume, stephens, states, david, hume, s, criticisms, of, the, argument, from, design, include, the, argument, that, for, all, we, know, a, committee, of, very, powerful, but, not, omnipotent, divine, beings, could, have, collaborated, in, creating, the, world, but, then, afterwards, left, it, alone, or, even, ceased, to, exist, this, would, be, polydeism, this, use, of, the, term, appears, to, originate, at, least, as, early, as, robert, m, bowman, jr, s,

are, many, gods, but, they, are, merely, superhuman, beings, they, are, remote, uninvolved, in, the, world, posing, no, threat, and, offering, no, hope, to, human, beings, epicureans, regarded, traditional, religion, and, idolatry, as, harmless, enough, as, long, as, the, gods, were, not, feared, or, expected, to, do, or, say, anything, sociologist, susan, starr, sered, used, the, term, in, her, 1994, book, priestess, mother, sacred, sister, religions, dominated, by, women, which, includes, a, chapter, titled, no, father, in, heaven, androgyny, and, polydeism, she, writes, that, she, has, chosen, to, gloss, on, polydeism, a, range, of, beliefs, in, more, than, one, supernatural, entity, sered, used, this, term, in, a, way, that, would, encompass, polytheism, rather, than, exclude, much, of, it, as, she, intended, to, capture, both, polytheistic, systems, and, nontheistic, systems, that, assert, the, influence, of, spirits, or, ancestors, this, use, of, the, term, however, does, not, accord, with, the, historical, misuse, of, deism, as, a, concept, to, describe, an, absent, creator, god
