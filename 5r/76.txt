idealism, in, philosophy, also, known, as, philosophical, idealism, or, metaphysical, idealism, is, the, set, of, metaphysical, perspectives, asserting, that, most, fundamentally, reality, is, equivalent, to, mind, spirit, or, consciousness, that, reality, is, entirely, a, mental, construct, or, that, ideas, are, the, highest, type, of, reality, or, have, the, greatest, claim, to, being, considered, real, because, there, are, different, types, of, idealism, it, is, difficult, to, define, the, term, uniformly, indian, philosophy, contains, some, of, the, first, defenses, of, idealism, such, as, in, vedanta, and, in, shaiva, pratyabhij, a, thought, these, systems, of, thought, argue, for, an, all, pervading, consciousness, as, the, true, nature, and, ground, of, reality, idealism, is, also, found, in, some, streams, of, mahayana, buddhism, such, as, in, the, yog, c, ra, school, which, argued, for, a, mind, only, cittamatra, philosophy, on, an, analysis, of, subjective, experience, in, the, west, idealism, traces, its, roots, back, to, plato, in, ancient, greece, who, proposed, that, absolute, unchanging, timeless, ideas, constitute, the, highest, form, of, reality, platonic, idealism, this, was, revived, and, transformed, in, the, early, modern, period, by, immanuel, kant, s, arguments, that, our, knowledge, of, reality, is, completely, based, on, mental, structures, transcendental, idealism, epistemologically, idealism, is, accompanied, by, a, rejection, of, the, possibility, of, knowing, the, existence, of, any, thing, independent, of, mind, ontologically, idealism, asserts, that, the, existence, of, all, things, depends, upon, the, mind, thus, ontological, idealism, rejects, the, perspectives, of, physicalism, and, dualism, in, contrast, to, materialism, idealism, asserts, the, primacy, of, consciousness, as, the, origin, and, prerequisite, of, all, phenomena, idealism, came, under, heavy, attack, in, the, west, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, most, influential, critics, were, g, e, moore, and, bertrand, russell, but, its, critics, also, included, the, new, realists, and, marxists, the, attacks, by, moore, and, russell, were, so, influential, that, even, more, than, 100, years, later, any, acknowledgment, of, idealistic, tendencies, is, viewed, in, the, english, speaking, world, with, reservation, however, many, aspects, and, paradigms, of, idealism, did, still, have, a, large, influence, on, subsequent, philosophy, idealism, is, a, term, with, several, related, meanings, it, comes, via, latin, idea, from, the, ancient, greek, idea, from, idein, meaning, to, see, the, term, entered, the, english, language, by, 1743, the, term, idealism, was, first, used, in, the, abstract, metaphysical, sense, of, the, belief, that, reality, is, made, up, only, of, ideas, by, christian, wolff, in, 1747, the, term, re, entered, the, english, language, in, this, abstract, sense, by, 1796, a, c, ewing, gives, this, influential, definition, the, view, that, there, can, be, no, physical, objects, existing, apart, from, some, experience, provided, that, we, regard, thinking, as, part, of, experience, and, do, not, imply, by, experience, passivity, and, provided, we, include, under, experience, not, only, human, experience, but, the, so, called, absolute, experience, or, the, experience, of, a, god, such, as, berkeley, postulates, a, more, recent, definition, by, willem, devries, sees, idealism, as, roughly, the, genus, comprises, theories, that, attribute, ontological, priority, to, the, mental, especially, the, conceptual, or, ideational, over, the, non, mental, as, such, idealism, entails, a, rejection, of, materialism, or, physicalism, as, well, as, the, rejection, of, the, mind, independent, existence, of, matter, and, as, such, also, entails, a, rejection, of, dualism, there, are, two, main, definitions, of, idealism, in, contemporary, philosophy, depending, on, whether, its, thesis, is, epistemic, or, metaphysical, thus, metaphysical, idealism, holds, that, reality, itself, is, non, physical, immaterial, or, experiential, at, its, core, while, epistemological, idealist, arguments, merely, affirm, that, reality, can, only, be, known, through, ideas, and, mental, structures, without, necessarily, making, metaphysical, claims, about, things, in, themselves, because, of, this, a, c, ewing, argued, that, instead, of, thinking, about, these, two, categories, as, forms, of, idealism, proper, we, should, instead, speak, of, epistemic, and, metaphysical, arguments, for, idealism, these, two, ways, of, arguing, for, idealism, are, sometimes, combined, together, to, defend, a, specific, type, of, idealism, as, done, by, berkeley, but, they, may, also, be, defended, as, independent, theses, by, different, thinkers, for, example, while, f, h, bradley, and, mctaggart, focused, on, metaphysical, arguments, josiah, royce, and, brand, blanshard, developed, epistemological, arguments, furthermore, one, might, use, epistemic, arguments, but, remain, neutral, about, the, metaphysical, nature, of, things, in, themselves, this, metaphysically, neutral, position, which, is, not, a, form, of, metaphysical, idealism, proper, may, be, associated, with, figures, like, rudolf, carnap, quine, donald, davidson, and, perhaps, even, kant, himself, though, he, is, difficult, to, categorize, the, most, famous, kind, of, epistemic, idealism, is, associated, with, kantianism, and, transcendental, idealism, as, well, as, with, the, related, neo, kantian, philosophies, transcendental, idealists, like, kant, affirm, epistemic, idealistic, arguments, without, committing, themselves, to, whether, reality, as, such, the, thing, in, itself, is, ultimately, mental, within, metaphysical, idealism, there, are, numerous, further, sub, types, including, forms, of, pluralism, which, hold, that, there, are, many, independent, mental, substances, or, minds, such, as, leibniz, monadology, and, various, forms, of, monism, or, absolute, idealism, e, g, hegelianism, or, advaita, vedanta, which, hold, that, the, fundamental, mental, reality, is, a, single, unity, or, is, grounded, some, kind, of, singular, absolute, beyond, this, idealists, disagree, on, which, aspects, of, the, mental, are, more, metaphysically, basic, platonic, idealism, affirms, that, ideal, forms, are, more, basic, to, reality, than, the, things, we, perceive, while, subjective, idealists, and, phenomenalists, privilege, sensory, experiences, personalism, meanwhile, sees, persons, or, selves, as, fundamental, a, common, distinction, is, between, subjective, and, objective, forms, of, idealism, subjective, idealists, like, george, berkeley, reject, the, existence, of, a, mind, independent, or, external, world, though, not, the, appearance, of, such, phenomena, in, the, mind, however, not, all, idealists, restrict, the, real, to, subjective, experience, objective, idealists, make, claims, about, a, trans, empirical, world, but, simply, deny, that, this, world, is, essentially, divorced, from, or, ontologically, prior, to, mind, or, consciousness, as, such, thus, objective, idealism, asserts, that, the, reality, of, experiencing, includes, and, transcends, the, realities, of, the, object, experienced, and, of, the, mind, of, the, observer, idealism, is, sometimes, categorized, as, a, type, of, metaphysical, anti, realism, or, skepticism, however, idealists, need, not, reject, the, existence, of, an, objective, reality, that, we, can, obtain, knowledge, of, and, can, merely, affirm, that, this, real, natural, world, is, mental, thus, david, chalmers, writes, of, anti, realist, idealisms, which, would, include, berkeley, s, and, realist, forms, of, idealism, such, as, panpsychist, versions, of, idealism, where, fundamental, microphysical, entities, are, conscious, subjects, and, on, which, matter, is, realized, by, these, conscious, subjects, and, their, relations, chalmers, further, outlines, the, following, taxonomy, of, idealism, micro, idealism, is, the, thesis, that, concrete, reality, is, wholly, grounded, in, micro, level, mentality, that, is, in, mentality, associated, with, fundamental, microscopic, entities, such, as, quarks, and, photons, macro, idealism, is, the, thesis, that, concrete, reality, is, wholly, grounded, in, macro, level, mentality, that, is, in, mentality, associated, with, macroscopic, middle, sized, entities, such, as, humans, and, perhaps, non, human, animals, cosmic, idealism, is, the, thesis, that, concrete, reality, is, wholly, grounded, in, cosmic, mentality, that, is, in, mentality, associated, with, the, cosmos, as, a, whole, or, with, a, single, cosmic, entity, such, as, the, universe, or, a, deity, guyer, et, al, also, distinguish, between, forms, of, idealism, which, are, grounded, in, substance, theory, often, found, in, the, anglophone, idealisms, of, the, late, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, and, forms, of, idealism, which, focus, on, activities, or, dynamic, processes, favored, in, post, kantian, german, philosophy, there, some, precursors, of, idealism, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, though, scholars, disagree, on, whether, any, of, these, thinkers, could, be, properly, labeled, idealist, in, the, modern, sense, one, example, is, anaxagoras, 480, bc, who, taught, that, all, things, in, the, universe, apeiron, were, set, in, motion, by, nous, mind, in, the, phaedo, plato, quotes, him, as, saying, it, is, intelligence, that, arranges, and, causes, all, things, similarly, parmenides, famously, stated, that, thinking, and, being, are, the, same, this, has, led, some, scholars, such, as, hegel, and, e, d, phillips, to, label, parmenides, an, idealist, plato, s, theory, of, forms, or, ideas, eidos, as, described, in, dialogues, like, phaedo, parmenides, and, sophist, describes, ideal, forms, for, example, the, platonic, solids, in, geometry, or, abstracts, like, goodness, and, justice, as, perfect, beings, which, exists, by, itself, greek, auto, kath, auto, that, is, independently, of, any, particular, instance, whether, physical, or, in, the, individual, thought, of, any, person, anything, that, exists, in, the, world, exists, by, participating, in, one, of, these, unique, ideas, which, are, nevertheless, interrelated, causally, with, the, world, of, becoming, with, nature, arne, gr, n, calls, this, doctrine, the, classic, example, of, a, metaphysical, idealism, as, a, transcendent, idealism, nevertheless, plato, holds, that, matter, as, perceived, by, us, is, real, though, transitory, imperfect, and, dependent, on, the, eternal, ideas, for, its, existence, because, of, this, some, scholars, have, seen, plato, as, a, dualist, though, others, disagree, and, favor, a, monist, account, the, thought, of, plato, was, widely, influential, and, later, late, platonist, or, neoplatonist, thinkers, developed, platonism, in, new, directions, plotinus, the, most, influential, of, the, later, platonists, wrote, being, and, intellect, are, therefore, one, nature, enneads, v, 9, 8, according, to, scholars, like, nathaniel, alfred, boll, and, ludwig, noir, with, plotinus, a, true, idealism, which, holds, that, only, soul, or, mind, exists, appears, for, the, first, time, in, western, philosophy, similarly, for, maria, luisa, gatti, plotinus, philosophy, is, a, contemplationist, metaphysics, in, which, contemplation, as, creative, constitutes, the, reason, for, the, being, of, everything, for, neoplatonist, thinkers, the, first, cause, or, prinicple, is, the, idea, of, the, good, i, e, the, one, from, which, everything, is, derived, a, hierarchical, procession, proodos, enn, vi, 7, 15, some, christian, theologians, have, held, idealist, views, often, based, on, neoplatonism, christian, neoplatonism, included, figures, like, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, and, influenced, numerous, christian, thinkers, including, the, cappadocian, fathers, and, augustine, despite, the, influence, of, aristotelian, scholasticism, from, the, 12th, century, onward, there, is, certainly, a, sense, in, which, some, medieval, scholastic, philosophers, retained, influences, from, the, platonic, idealism, that, came, via, augustine, for, example, the, work, of, john, scottus, eriugena, c, 800, c, 877, has, been, interpreted, as, an, idealistic, philosophy, by, dermot, moran, who, writes, that, for, scottus, all, spatiotemporal, reality, is, understood, as, immaterial, mind, dependent, and, lacking, in, independent, existence, scottus, thus, wrote, the, intellection, of, all, things, is, the, being, of, all, things, idealism, was, also, defended, in, medieval, jewish, philosophy, according, to, samuel, lebens, early, hassidic, rabbis, like, yitzchak, luria, 1534, 72, defended, a, form, of, kabbalistic, idealism, in, which, the, world, was, god, s, dream, or, a, fictional, tale, told, by, god, later, western, theistic, idealism, such, as, that, of, hermann, lotze, offers, a, theory, of, the, world, ground, in, which, all, things, find, their, unity, it, has, been, widely, accepted, by, protestant, theologians, several, modern, religious, movements, such, as, for, example, the, organizations, within, the, new, thought, movement, and, the, unity, church, may, be, said, to, have, a, particularly, idealist, orientation, the, theology, of, christian, science, includes, a, form, of, idealism, it, teaches, that, all, that, truly, exists, is, god, and, god, s, ideas, that, the, world, as, it, appears, to, the, senses, is, a, distortion, of, the, underlying, spiritual, reality, a, distortion, that, may, be, corrected, both, conceptually, and, in, terms, of, human, experience, through, a, reorientation, spiritualization, of, thought, confucianism, persons, topics, neo, confucianism, new, confucianism, daoism, persons, topics, legalism, mohism, military, and, strategy, han, buddhism, tibetan, buddhism, maoism, general, topics, vedic, philosophy, mimamsa, vedanta, samkhya, yoga, nyaya, navya, ny, ya, vaisheshika, n, stika, heterodox,

confucianism, persons, topics, donghak, modern, thought, persons, topics, there, are, currents, of, idealism, throughout, indian, philosophy, ancient, and, modern, some, forms, of, hindu, idealism, like, advaita, defend, a, type, of, monism, or, non, dualism, in, which, a, single, consciousness, brahman, is, all, that, exists, however, other, traditions, defend, a, theistic, pluralism, e, g, shaiva, siddhanta, in, which, there, are, many, selves, atman, and, one, god, buddhist, idealism, on, the, other, hand, is, non, theistic, and, does, not, accept, the, existence, of, eternal, selves, due, to, their, adherence, to, the, theory, of, not, self, a, type, of, idealistic, monism, can, be, seen, in, the, upanishads, which, often, describe, the, ultimate, reality, of, brahman, as, being, consciousness, bliss, saccid, nanda, the, ch, ndogya, upani, ad, teaches, that, everything, is, an, emanation, of, the, immortal, brahman, which, is, the, essence, and, source, of, all, things, and, is, identical, with, the, self, atman, the, b, had, ra, yaka, upani, ad, also, describes, brahman, as, awaress, and, bliss, and, states, that, this, great, being, mahad, bh, tam, without, an, end, boundless, ap, ra, nothing, but, vij, na, idealist, notions, can, be, found, in, different, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, including, some, schools, of, vedanta, other, schools, like, the, samkhya, and, nyaya, vaisheshika, mimamsa, yoga, vishishtadvaita, dvaita, and, others, opposed, idealism, in, favor, of, realism, different, schools, of, vedanta, have, different, interpretations, of, brahman, atman, their, foundational, theory, advaita, vedanta, posits, an, absolute, idealistic, monism, in, which, reality, is, one, single, absolute, existence, thus, brahman, the, ultimate, ground, of, all, is, absolutely, identical, with, all, atmans, individual, selves, other, forms, of, vedanta, like, the, vishishtadvaita, of, ramanuja, and, the, bhedabheda, of, bh, skara, are, not, as, radical, in, their, non, dualism, accepting, that, there, is, a, certain, difference, between, individual, souls, and, brahman, the, most, influential, advaita, philosopher, was, di, a, kara, 788, 820, in, his, philosophy, brahman, is, the, single, non, dual, foundation, adhi, hana, for, all, existence, this, reality, is, independent, self, established, irreducible, immutable, and, free, of, space, time, and, causation, in, comparison, to, this, reality, the, world, of, plurality, and, appearances, is, illusory, maya, an, unreal, cognitive, error, mithya, this, includes, all, individual, souls, or, selves, which, are, actually, unreal, and, numerically, identical, to, the, one, brahman, a, kara, did, not, believe, it, was, possible, to, prove, the, view, that, reality, is, one, only, without, a, second, chandogya, 6, 2, 1, through, independent, philosophical, reasoning, instead, he, accepts, non, duality, based, on, the, authority, of, the, upani, ads, as, such, most, of, his, extant, works, are, scriptural, commentaries, nevertheless, he, did, provide, various, new, arguments, to, defend, his, theories, a, major, metaphysical, distinction, for, a, kara, is, between, what, changes, and, may, thus, be, negated, the, unreal, and, what, does, not, which, is, what, is, truly, real, he, compares, the, real, to, clay, the, substantial, cause, analogous, to, brahman, and, the, unreal, to, a, pot, which, depends, on, the, clay, for, its, being, analogous, to, all, impermanent, things, in, the, universe, by, relying, on, dependence, relations, and, on, the, reality, of, persistence, a, kara, concludes, that, metaphysical, foundations, are, more, real, than, their, impermanent, effects, and, that, effects, are, fully, reducible, and, indeed, identical, to, their, metaphysical, foundation, through, this, argument, from, dependence, a, kara, concludes, that, since, all, things, in, the, universe, undergoes, change, they, must, depend, on, some, really, existent, cause, for, their, being, and, this, is, the, one, primordial, undifferentiated, existence, chandogya, bh, ya, 6, 2, 1, 2, this, one, reality, is, the, single, cause, that, is, in, every, object, and, every, thing, is, not, different, from, this, brahman, since, all, things, borrow, their, existence, from, it, a, kara, also, provides, a, cosmogony, in, which, the, world, arises, from, an, unmanifest, state, which, is, like, deep, dreamless, sleep, into, a, state, in, which, vara, god, dreams, the, world, into, existence, as, such, the, world, is, not, separate, from, god, s, mind, a, kara, s, philosophy, along, with, that, of, his, contemporary, ma, ana, mi, ra, c, 8th, century, ce, is, at, the, foundation, of, advaita, school, the, opponents, of, this, school, however, labeled, him, a, m, y, v, din, illusionist, for, negating, the, reality, of, the, world, they, also, criticized, what, they, saw, as, a, problematic, explanation, for, how, the, world, arises, from, m, y, as, an, error, for, them, if, m, y, is, in, brahman, then, brahman, has, ignorance, but, if, it, is, not, in, brahman, then, this, collapses, into, a, dualism, of, brahman, and, m, y, perhaps, the, most, influential, critic, of, advaita, was, r, m, nuja, c, 1017, c, 1137, the, main, philosopher, of, the, competing, vi, i, dvaita, qualified, non, dual, school, his, philosophy, affirms, the, reality, of, the, world, and, individual, selves, as, well, as, affirming, an, underlying, unity, of, all, things, with, god, one, of, r, m, nuja, s, critiques, of, advaita, is, epistemological, if, as, advaita, argues, all, cognition, other, than, pure, undifferentiated, consciousness, is, based, in, error, then, it, follows, we, would, have, no, knowledge, of, the, very, fact, that, all, individual, cognition, is, error, r, bh, ya, i, i, 1, furthermore, r, m, nuja, also, argues, contra, advaita, that, individual, selves, are, real, and, not, illusory, this, is, because, the, very, idea, that, an, individual, can, be, ignorant, presupposes, the, very, existence, of, that, individual, furthermore, since, all, ved, ntins, agree, that, brahman, s, nature, is, knowledge, consciousness, and, being, to, say, that, brahman, is, ignorant, is, absurd, and, so, it, must, be, individual, souls, which, are, ignorant, thus, there, must, be, individual, selves, with, a, metaphysically, prior, existence, who, then, fall, into, ignorance, r, bh, ya, i, i, 1, selves, might, be, individual, but, as, the, vedas, state, they, still, share, a, sense, of, unity, with, brahman, for, r, m, nuja, this, is, because, selves, are, distinct, modes, or, qualities, in, the, cosmic, body, of, brahman, and, are, thus, different, and, yet, united, with, brahman, brahman, meanwhile, is, like, the, soul, in, the, body, of, the, world, furthermore, brahman, is, a, theistic, creator, god, for, r, m, nuja, which, really, exists, as, the, union, of, two, deities, vishnu, and, lak, m, the, philosophy, of, the, tantric, tradition, of, trika, shaivism, is, a, non, dual, theistic, idealism, the, key, thinkers, of, this, philosophical, tradition, known, as, the, pratyabhij, recognition, school, are, the, kashmirian, philosophers, utpaladeva, c, 900, 950, ce, and, abhinavagupta, 975, 1025, ce, this, tradition, affirms, a, non, dual, monism, which, sees, god, shiva, as, a, single, cosmic, consciousness, all, selves, atman, are, one, with, god, but, they, have, forgotten, this, and, must, recognize, their, true, nature, in, order, to, reach, liberation, unlike, in, advaita, vedanta, however, the, one, cosmic, consciousness, is, active, and, dynamic, consisting, of, spontaneous, vibration, spanda, since, it, has, the, quality, of, absolute, freedom, sv, t, ntrya, through, the, power, akti, of, dynamic, vibrations, the, absolute, shiva, akti, consciousness, and, its, power, creates, the, world, and, so, the, world, is, a, real, manifestation, of, absolute, consciousness, thus, in, this, system, the, world, and, individual, selves, which, are, dynamic, not, an, unchanging, witness, are, not, an, unreal, illusion, but, are, seen, as, real, and, active, expressions, of, god, s, creative, freedom, idealism, has, remained, influential, in, modern, hindu, philosophy, especially, in, neo, vedanta, modernism, prominent, modern, defenders, include, ram, mohan, roy, 1772, 1833, vivekananda, 1863, 1902, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, an, idealist, view, of, life, 1932, and, aurobindo, 1872, 1950, buddhist, views, reminiscent, of, idealism, appear, in, mahayana, scriptures, like, the, explanation, of, the, profound, secrets, descent, into, la, ka, and, ten, stages, sutra, these, theories, known, as, mind, only, cittamatra, or, the, consciousness, doctrine, vij, anavada, were, mostly, associated, with, the, indian, buddhist, philosophers, of, the, yog, c, ra, school, and, the, related, epistemological, school, pram, av, da, these, figures, include, vasubandhu, asa, ga, dign, ga, dharmak, rti, sthiramati, dharmap, la, j, na, r, mitra, a, karanandana, and, ratn, kara, nti, their, arguments, were, a, lively, subject, of, debate, for, buddhist, and, non, buddhist, philosophers, in, india, for, centuries, these, discussions, had, a, lasting, influence, on, the, later, buddhist, philosophy, of, east, asian, buddhism, and, tibetan, buddhism, there, is, some, modern, scholarly, disagreement, about, whether, indian, yog, c, ra, buddhism, can, be, said, to, be, a, form, of, idealism, some, writers, like, philosopher, jay, garfield, and, german, philologist, lambert, schmithausen, argue, that, indian, yogacarins, are, metaphysical, idealists, that, reject, the, existence, of, a, mind, independent, external, world, others, see, them, as, closer, to, an, epistemic, idealist, like, kant, who, holds, that, our, knowledge, of, the, world, is, simply, knowledge, of, our, own, concepts, and, perceptions, however, a, major, difference, here, is, that, while, kant, holds, that, the, thing, in, itself, is, unknowable, indian, yogacarins, held, that, ultimate, reality, is, knowable, but, only, through, the, non, conceptual, yogic, perception, of, a, highly, trained, meditative, mind, other, scholars, like, dan, lusthaus, and, thomas, kochumuttom, see, yog, c, ra, as, a, kind, of, phenomenology, of, experience, which, seeks, to, understand, how, suffering, dukkha, arises, in, the, mind, not, provide, a, metaphysics, whatever, the, case, the, works, of, vasubandhu, fl, c, 360, certainly, include, a, refutation, of, mind, independent, external, objects, sanskrit, b, hy, rtha, and, argue, that, the, true, nature, of, reality, is, beyond, subject, object, distinctions, he, views, ordinary, conscious, experience, as, deluded, in, its, perceptions, of, an, external, world, separate, from, itself, which, does, not, exist, and, instead, argues, that, all, there, is, vij, apti, ideas, mental, images, conscious, appearances, representations, vasubandhu, begins, his, twenty, verses, vi, ik, by, affirming, that, all, this, is, mere, appearance, of, consciousness, because, of, the, appearance, of, non, existent, objects, just, as, a, man, with, an, eye, disease, sees, non, existent, hairs, vi, 1, his, main, argument, against, external, objects, is, a, critique, of, the, atomist, theories, of, his, realist, opponents, ny, ya, and, abhidharma, theorists, vasubandhu, also, responds, against, three, objections, to, idealism, which, indicate, his, view, that, all, appearances, are, caused, by, mind, 1, the, issue, of, spatio, temporal, continuity, 2, accounting, for, intersubjectivity, and, 3, the, causal, efficacy, of, matter, on, subjects, for, the, first, and, third, objections, vasubandhu, responds, by, arguing, that, dreams, can, also, include, spatio, temporal, continuity, regularity, and, causal, efficacy, regarding, intersubjectivity, vasubandhu, appeals, to, shared, karma, as, well, as, mind, to, mind, causation, after, answering, these, objections, vasubandhu, argues, that, idealism, is, a, better, explanation, than, realism, for, everyday, experiences, to, do, this, he, relies, on, the, indian, principle, of, lightness, an, appeal, to, parsimony, like, occam, s, razor, and, argues, that, idealism, is, the, lighter, theory, since, it, posits, a, smaller, number, of, entities, this, is, thus, an, argument, from, simplicity, and, an, inference, to, the, best, explanation, i, e, an, abductive, argument, as, such, he, affirms, that, our, usual, experience, of, being, a, self, tman, that, knows, objects, is, an, illusory, construct, and, this, constitutes, what, he, calls, the, imagined, nature, aspect, of, reality, thus, for, vasubandhu, there, is, a, more, fundamental, root, consciousness, that, is, empty, of, subject, object, distinctions, and, yet, originates, all, experiences, just, as, waves, originate, on, water, thirty, verses, tri, 17, however, vasubandhu, sees, this, philosophy, is, a, mere, conventional, description, since, ultimate, reality, is, inconceivable, tri, 29, an, ineffable, and, non, conceptual, thusness, which, cannot, be, fully, captured, in, words, and, can, only, be, known, through, meditative, realization, by, yogis, yogacaras, hence, the, name, of, his, school, this, is, why, certain, modern, interpreters, like, jonathan, gold, see, vasubandhu, s, thought, as, a, conventionalist, idealism, or, even, a, type, of, epistemic, idealism, like, kant, s, and, not, a, full, blown, objective, idealism, buddhist, arguments, against, external, objects, were, further, expanded, and, sharpened, by, later, figures, like, dign, ga, fl, 6th, century, and, dharmak, rti, fl, 7th, century, who, led, an, epistemological, turn, in, medieval, indian, philosophy, dign, ga, s, main, arguments, against, external, objects, specifically, atomic, particles, are, found, in, his, lambanapar, k, examination, of, the, object, of, consciousness, dign, ga, argues, that, for, something, to, be, an, object, lambana, of, a, conscious, state, that, object, must, be, causally, related, to, the, consciousness, and, it, must, resemble, that, consciousness, in, appearance, or, content, dign, ga, then, attempts, to, show, that, realism, about, external, particulars, cannot, satisfy, these, two, conditions, since, individual, atoms, lack, a, resemblance, to, the, conscious, state, they, supposedly, cause, they, cannot, be, the, object, of, cognition, furthermore, aggregates, of, atoms, also, cannot, be, the, object, since, they, are, merely, a, conceptual, grouping, of, individual, atoms, and, thus, unreal, and, only, atoms, have, causal, efficacy, dharmak, rti, s, view, is, summed, up, in, the, pram, na, rttika, commentary, on, epistemology, as, follows, cognition, experiences, itself, and, nothing, else, whatsoever, even, the, particular, objects, of, perception, are, by, nature, just, consciousness, itself, one, of, his, main, arguments, for, idealism, is, the, inference, from, the, necessity, of, things, only, ever, being, experienced, together, with, experience, sanskrit, sahopalambhaniyama, dharmak, rti, consicely, states, this, argument, in, the, ascertainment, of, epistemology, pram, avini, caya, blue, and, the, consciousness, of, blue, are, not, different, because, they, must, always, be, apprehended, together, since, an, object, is, never, found, independently, of, consciousness, objects, cannot, be, mind, independent, this, can, be, read, as, an, epistemological, argument, for, idealism, which, attempts, to, show, there, is, no, good, reason, empirically, or, inferentially, to, accept, the, existence, of, external, objects, most, of, the, yog, c, ra, thinkers, and, epistemologists, including, dharmak, rti, defended, the, existence, of, multiple, mindstreams, and, even, tackled, the, problem, of, other, minds, as, such, thinkers, like, dharmak, rti, were, pluralists, who, held, there, were, multiple, minds, in, the, world, in, this, they, differ, with, hindu, advaita, thinkers, who, held, there, was, a, single, cosmic, consciousness, however, there, was, a, certain, sub, school, of, indian, buddhists, exemplified, by, praj, akaragupta, j, na, r, mitra, fl, 975, 1025, c, e, and, ratnak, rti, 11th, century, ce, who, were, not, pluralists, in, his, refutation, of, other, mindstreams, sant, n, ntarad, a, a, ratnak, rti, argues, that, the, existence, of, other, minds, cannot, be, established, ultimately, and, as, such, ultimate, reality, must, be, an, undifferentiated, non, dual, consciousness, vij, n, dvaita, this, monistic, interpretation, of, yog, c, ra, is, known, as, the, citr, dvaitav, da, school, the, view, of, variegated, non, duality, since, it, sees, reality, as, a, single, multifaceted, non, dual, luminosity, citr, dvaitaprak, a, in, chinese, philosophy, yog, c, ra, idealism, was, defended, by, chinese, buddhists, like, xuanzang, 602, 664, and, his, students, kuiji, 632, 682, and, w, nch, k, 613, 696, xuanzang, had, studied, yog, c, ra, buddhism, at, the, great, indian, university, of, nalanda, under, the, indian, philosopher, labhadra, his, work, especially, the, demonstration, of, consciousness, only, was, pivotal, in, the, establishment, of, east, asian, yog, c, ra, buddhism, also, known, as, consciousness, only, ch, weishi, which, in, turn, influenced, east, asian, buddhist, thought, in, general, yog, c, ra, buddhism, also, influenced, the, thought, of, other, chinese, buddhist, philosophical, traditions, such, as, huayan, tiantai, pure, land, and, zen, many, chinese, buddhist, traditions, like, huayan, zen, and, tiantai, were, also, strongly, influenced, by, an, important, text, called, the, awakening, of, faith, in, the, mah, y, na, which, synthesized, consciousness, only, idealism, with, buddha, nature, thought, this, text, promoted, an, influential, theory, of, mind, which, holds, that, all, phenomena, are, manifestations, of, the, one, mind, some, scholars, have, seen, this, as, an, ontological, monism, one, passage, from, the, text, states, the, three, worlds, are, illusory, constructs, created, by, the, mind, alone, and, all, dharmas, are, produced, from, the, mind, s, giving, rise, to, false, thoughts, jorgensen, et, al, note, that, this, indicates, metaphysical, idealism, the, new, philosophical, trend, ushered, in, by, the, awakening, of, faith, was, resisted, by, some, chinese, yog, c, ra, thinkers, and, the, debates, between, the, yog, c, ra, school, of, xuanzang, and, those, who, instead, followed, the, doctrines, of, the, awakening, of, faith, continued, until, the, modern, era, these, debates, happened, in, china, as, well, as, in, japan, and, korea, the, doctrine, that, all, phenomena, arise, from, an, ultimate, principle, the, one, mind, was, adapted, by, the, influential, huayan, school, whose, thought, is, exemplified, by, thinkers, such, as, fazang, 643, 712, and, zongmi, 780, 841, this, tradition, also, promoted, a, kind, of, holism, which, sees, every, phenomenon, in, the, cosmos, as, interfused, and, interconnected, with, every, other, phenomenon, chinese, scholars, like, yu, lan, fung, and, wing, tsit, chan, see, huayan, philosophy, as, a, form, of, idealism, though, other, scholars, have, defended, alternative, interpretations, according, to, wing, tsit, chan, since, huayan, patriarch, fazang, sees, the, one, mind, as, the, basis, for, all, things, including, the, external, world, his, system, is, one, of, objective, idealism, a, key, distinction, between, huayan, s, view, of, the, world, and, that, of, the, yog, c, ra, school, is, that, in, huayan, there, is, a, single, intersubjective, world, which, nevertheless, arises, from, mind, while, yog, c, ra, holds, that, each, mindstream, projects, its, own, world, out, of, their, underlying, root, consciousness, chinese, buddhist, idealism, also, influenced, confucian, philosophy, through, the, work, of, thinkers, like, the, ming, era, 1368, 1644, neo, confucian, wang, yangming, 1472, 1529, wang, s, thought, has, been, interpreted, as, a, kind, of, idealism, according, to, wang, the, ultimate, principle, or, pattern, l, of, the, whole, universe, is, identical, with, the, mind, which, forms, one, body, or, substance, y, t, with, heaven, earth, and, the, myriad, creatures, of, the, world, wang, argues, that, only, this, view, can, explain, the, fact, that, human, beings, experience, innate, care, and, benevolence, for, others, as, well, as, a, sense, of, care, for, inanimate, objects, wang, s, thought, along, with, that, of, lu, xiangshan, led, to, the, creation, of, the, school, of, mind, an, important, neo, confucian, tradition, which, emphasized, these, idealist, views, yog, c, ra, idealism, saw, a, revival, in, the, 20th, century, associated, figures, like, yang, wenhui, 1837, 1911, taixu, liang, shuming, ouyang, jingwu, 1870, 1943, wang, xiaoxu, 1875, 1948, and, lu, cheng, modern, chinese, thinkers, associated, with, consciousness, only, linked, the, philosophy, with, western, philosophy, especially, hegelian, and, kantian, thought, and, modern, science, a, similar, trend, occurred, among, some, japanese, philosophers, like, inoue, enry, who, linked, east, asian, philosophies, like, huayan, with, the, philosophy, of, hegel, both, modern, chinese, buddhists, and, new, confucian, thinkers, participated, in, this, revival, of, consciousness, only, studies, the, thought, of, new, confucians, like, xiong, shili, ma, yifu, tang, junyi, and, mou, zongsan, was, influenced, by, yog, c, ra, consciousness, only, philosophy, as, well, as, by, the, metaphysics, of, the, awakening, of, faith, in, the, mah, y, na, though, their, thought, also, contained, many, critiques, of, buddhist, philosophy, it, is, only, in, the, modern, era, that, idealism, became, a, central, topic, of, argumentation, among, western, philosophers, this, was, also, when, the, term, idealism, coined, by, christian, wolff, 1679, 1754, though, previous, thinkers, like, berkeley, had, argued, for, it, under, different, names, idealistic, tendencies, can, be, found, in, the, work, of, some, rationalist, philosophers, like, leibniz, and, nicolas, malebranche, though, they, did, not, use, the, term, malebranche, argued, that, platonic, ideas, which, exist, only, in, the, mind, of, god, are, the, ultimate, ground, of, our, experiences, and, of, the, physical, world, a, view, that, prefigures, later, idealist, positions, some, scholars, also, see, leibniz, philosophy, as, approaching, idealism, guyer, et, al, write, that, his, view, that, the, states, of, monads, can, be, only, perceptions, and, appetitions, desires, suggests, a, metaphysical, argument, for, idealism, while, his, famous, thesis, that, each, monad, represents, the, entire, universe, from, its, own, point, of, view, might, be, taken, to, be, an, epistemological, ground, for, idealism, even, if, he, does, not, say, as, much, however, there, is, still, much, debate, in, the, contemporary, scholarly, literature, on, whether, leibniz, can, be, considered, an, idealist, one, famous, proponent, of, modern, idealism, was, bishop, george, berkeley, 1685, 1753, an, anglo, irish, philosopher, who, defended, a, theory, he, called, immaterialism, this, kind, of, idealism, is, sometimes, also, called, subjective, idealism, also, known, as, phenomenalistic, idealism, berkeley, held, that, objects, exist, only, to, the, extent, that, a, mind, perceives, them, and, thus, the, physical, world, does, not, exist, outside, of, mind, berkeley, s, epistemic, argument, for, this, view, found, in, his, a, treatise, concerning, the, principles, of, human, knowledge, rests, on, the, premise, that, we, can, only, know, ideas, in, the, mind, thus, knowledge, does, not, extend, to, mind, independent, things, treatise, 1710, part, i, 2, from, this, berkeley, holds, that, the, existence, of, an, idea, consists, in, being, perceived, thus, regarding, ideas, their, esse, is, percipi, that, is, to, be, is, to, be, perceived, 1710, part, i, 3, based, on, this, restriction, of, existence, to, only, what, is, being, perceived, berkeley, holds, that, it, is, meaningless, to, think, that, there, could, exist, objects, that, are, not, being, perceived, this, is, the, basic, idea, behind, what, has, been, called, berkeley, s, master, argument, for, idealism, which, states, that, one, cannot, conceive, of, anything, existing, unconceived, because, in, trying, to, do, so, one, is, still, conceiving, of, the, object, 1710, part, i, 23, as, to, the, question, of, how, objects, which, are, currently, not, being, perceived, by, individual, minds, persist, in, the, world, berkeley, answers, that, a, single, eternal, mind, keeps, all, of, physical, reality, stable, and, causes, ideas, in, the, first, place, and, this, is, god, berkeley, also, argued, for, idealism, based, on, a, second, key, premise, an, idea, can, be, like, nothing, but, an, idea, and, as, such, there, cannot, be, any, things, without, or, outside, mind, this, is, because, for, something, to, be, like, something, else, there, must, be, something, they, have, in, common, if, something, is, mind, independent, then, it, must, be, completely, different, from, ideas, thus, there, can, be, no, relation, between, ideas, in, the, mind, and, things, without, the, mind, since, they, are, not, alike, as, berkeley, writes, i, ask, whether, those, supposed, originals, or, external, things, of, which, our, ideas, are, the, pictures, or, representations, be, themselves, perceivable, or, no, if, they, are, then, they, are, ideas, and, we, have, gained, our, point, but, if, you, say, they, are, not, i, appeal, to, any, one, whether, it, be, sense, to, assert, a, colour, is, like, something, which, is, invisible, hard, or, soft, like, something, which, is, intangible, and, so, of, the, rest, 1710, part, i, 8, a, similar, idealistic, philosophy, was, developed, at, around, the, same, time, as, berkeley, by, anglican, priest, and, philosopher, arthur, collier, clavis, universalis, or, a, new, inquiry, after, truth, being, a, demonstration, of, the, non, existence, or, impossibility, of, an, external, world, 1713, collier, claimed, to, have, developed, his, view, that, all, matter, depends, on, mind, independently, of, berkeley, paul, brunton, a, british, philosopher, and, mystic, also, taught, a, similar, type, of, idealism, called, mentalism, a, a, luce, and, john, foster, are, other, subjective, idealists, luce, in, sense, without, matter, 1954, attempts, to, bring, berkeley, up, to, date, by, modernizing, his, vocabulary, and, putting, the, issues, he, faced, in, modern, terms, and, treats, the, biblical, account, of, matter, and, the, psychology, of, perception, and, nature, foster, s, the, case, for, idealism, argues, that, the, physical, world, is, the, logical, creation, of, natural, non, logical, constraints, on, human, sense, experience, foster, s, latest, defense, of, his, views, phenomenalistic, idealism, is, in, his, book, a, world, for, us, the, case, for, phenomenalistic, idealism, critics, of, subjective, idealism, include, bertrand, russell, s, popular, 1912, book, the, problems, of, philosophy, australian, philosopher, david, stove, alan, musgrave, and, john, searle, transcendental, idealism, was, developed, by, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, who, was, the, first, philosopher, to, label, himself, an, idealist, in, his, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, was, clear, to, distinguish, his, view, which, he, also, called, critical, and, empirical, realism, from, berkeley, s, idealism, and, from, descartes, views, kant, s, philosophy, holds, that, we, only, have, knowledge, of, our, experiences, which, consists, jointly, of, intuitions, and, concepts, as, such, our, experiences, reflect, our, cognitive, structures, not, the, intrinsic, nature, of, mind, independent, things, this, means, even, time, and, space, are, not, properties, of, things, in, themselves, i, e, mind, independent, reality, underlying, appearances, since, it, focuses, on, the, mind, dependent, nature, of, knowledge, and, not, on, metaphysics, per, se, transcendental, idealism, is, a, type, of, epistemological, idealism, unlike, metaphysical, forms, of, idealism, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, does, not, deny, the, existence, of, mind, independent, things, or, affirm, that, they, must, be, mental, he, thus, accepts, that, we, can, conceive, of, external, objects, as, distinct, from, our, representations, of, them, however, he, argues, that, we, cannot, know, what, external, objects, are, in, themselves, as, such, kant, s, system, can, be, called, idealist, in, some, respects, e, g, regarding, space, and, time, and, also, realist, in, that, he, accepts, there, must, be, some, mind, independent, reality, even, if, we, cannot, know, its, ultimate, nature, and, thus, must, remain, agnostic, about, this, kant, s, system, also, affirms, the, reality, of, a, free, truly, existent, self, and, of, a, god, which, he, sees, as, being, possible, because, the, non, temporal, nature, of, the, thing, in, itself, allows, for, a, radical, freedom, and, genuine, spontaneity, kant, s, main, argument, for, his, idealism, found, throughout, the, critique, of, pure, reason, is, based, on, the, key, premise, that, we, always, represent, objects, in, space, and, time, through, our, a, priori, intuitions, knowledge, which, is, independent, from, any, experience, thus, according, to, kant, space, and, time, can, never, represent, any, property, at, all, of, any, things, in, themselves, nor, any, relations, of, them, to, each, other, i, e, no, determination, of, them, that, attaches, to, objects, themselves, and, that, would, remain, even, if, one, were, to, abstract, from, all, subjective, conditions, of, intuition, cpur, a, 26, b, 42, kant, s, main, point, is, that, since, our, mental, representations, have, spatio, temporal, structure, we, have, no, real, grounds, for, positing, that, the, real, objects, our, mind, represents, in, this, way, also, have, spatio, temporal, structure, in, themselves, kant, makes, this, argument, in, different, parts, of, the, critique, such, as, when, he, asks, rhetorically, if, there, did, not, lie, in, you, a, faculty, for, intuiting, a, priori, if, this, subjective, condition, were, not, at, the, same, time, the, universal, a, priori, condition, under, which, alone, the, object, of, intuition, is, possible, if, the, object, the, triangle, were, something, in, itself, without, relation, to, your, subject, then, how, could, you, say, that, what, necessarily, lies, in, your, subjective, conditions, for, constructing, a, triangle, must, also, necessarily, pertain, to, the, triangle, in, itself, a, 48, b, 65, throughout, his, career, kant, labored, to, distinguish, his, philosophy, from, metaphysical, idealism, as, some, of, his, critics, charged, him, with, being, a, berkeleyian, idealist, he, argued, that, even, if, we, cannot, know, how, things, are, in, themselves, we, do, know, they, must, exist, and, that, we, know, this, through, the, representations, which, their, influence, on, our, sensibility, provides, for, us, in, the, second, edition, of, his, critique, he, even, inserted, a, refutation, of, idealism, for, kant, the, perception, of, this, persistent, thing, is, possible, only, through, a, thing, outside, me, and, not, through, the, mere, representation, of, a, thing, outside, me, kant, s, philosophy, was, extremely, influential, on, european, enlightenment, thinkers, and, counter, enlightenment, ones, as, well, and, his, ideas, were, widely, discussed, and, debated, transcendental, idealism, was, also, defended, by, later, kantian, philosophers, who, adopted, his, method, such, as, karl, leonhard, reinhold, and, jakob, sigismund, beck, the, mid, 19th, century, saw, a, revival, of, kantian, philosophy, which, became, known, as, neo, kantianism, with, its, call, of, back, to, kant, this, movement, was, especially, influential, on, 19th, century, german, academic, philosophy, and, also, continental, philosophy, as, a, whole, some, important, figures, include, hermann, cohen, 1842, 1918, wilhelm, windelband, 1848, 1914, ernst, cassirer, hermann, von, helmholtz, eduard, zeller, leonard, nelson, heinrich, rickert, and, friedrich, albert, lange, a, key, concern, of, the, neo, kantians, was, to, update, kantian, epistemology, particularly, in, order, to, provide, an, epistemic, basis, for, the, modern, sciences, all, while, avoiding, ontology, altogether, whether, idealist, or, materialist, neo, kantianism, rejected, metaphysical, idealism, while, also, accepting, the, basic, kantian, premise, that, our, experience, of, reality, is, always, structured, by, the, distinctive, features, of, human, mentality, hence, cassirer, defended, an, epistemic, worldview, that, held, that, one, cannot, reduce, reality, to, any, independent, or, substantial, object, physical, or, mental, instead, there, are, only, different, ways, of, describing, and, organizing, experience, neo, kantianism, influenced, the, work, of, the, vienna, circle, and, its, ambassadors, to, the, anglophone, world, rudolf, carnap, 1891, 1970, and, hans, reichenbach, charles, bernard, renouvier, was, the, first, philosopher, in, france, to, formulate, a, system, based, on, kant, s, critical, idealism, which, he, termed, neo, criticism, n, o, criticisme, it, is, a, transformation, rather, than, a, continuation, of, kantianism, several, important, german, thinkers, who, were, deeply, influenced, by, kant, are, the, german, idealists, johann, gottlieb, fichte, 1762, 1814, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, 1775, 1854, and, georg, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, though, heavily, drawing, on, kant, these, thinkers, were, not, transcendental, idealists, as, such, and, they, sought, to, move, beyond, the, idea, that, things, in, themselves, are, unknowable, an, idea, they, considered, as, opening, the, door, to, skepticism, and, nihilism, post, kantian, german, idealists, thus, rejected, transcendental, idealism, by, arguing, against, the, opposition, of, a, mind, independent, world, of, being, and, a, subjective, world, of, mental, constructs, or, the, separation, between, the, knowledge, and, what, is, known, between, subject, and, object, real, and, ideal, this, new, german, idealism, was, distinguished, by, an, inseparability, of, being, and, thinking, and, a, dynamic, conception, of, self, consciousness, that, sees, reality, as, spontaneous, conscious, activity, and, its, expressions, as, such, this, kind, of, metaphysical, idealism, focused, on, dynamic, processes, and, forces, was, opposed, to, older, forms, of, idealism, which, based, itself, on, substance, theory, which, these, germans, labeled, dogmatism, the, first, thinker, to, elaborate, this, type, of, dynamic, idealism, was, j, g, fichte, doctrine, of, wissenschaft, 1810, 1813, for, fichte, the, primordial, act, at, the, ground, of, being, is, called, self, positing, fichte, argues, that, self, consciousness, or, the, i, is, a, spontaneous, unconditioned, self, creating, act, which, he, also, called, the, deed, act, tathandlung, fichte, argues, that, positing, something, unconditioned, and, independent, at, the, ground, of, all, is, the, only, way, to, avoid, an, epistemic, infinite, regress, according, to, fichte, this, i, am, or, absolute, subject, which, originally, posits, its, own, being, absolutely, doctrine, i, 2, 261, is, at, the, same, time, the, actor, and, the, product, of, the, act, the, actor, and, that, which, the, activity, brings, forth, act, and, deed, are, one, and, the, same, doctrine, i, 2, 259, fichte, also, argues, that, this, i, has, the, capacity, to, counter, posit, a, not, i, leading, to, a, subject, object, relationship, the, i, also, has, a, third, capacity, fichte, calls, divisibility, which, allows, for, the, existence, of, plurality, in, the, world, which, however, must, be, understood, as, manifestations, of, the, i, activity, and, as, being, within, the, i, fichte, s, philosophy, was, adopted, by, schelling, who, defended, this, new, idealism, as, a, full, monistic, ontology, which, tried, to, account, for, all, of, nature, which, he, would, eventually, name, absolute, idealism, for, schelling, reality, is, an, original, unity, urspr, ngliche, einheit, or, a, primordial, totality, uranf, ngliche, ganzheit, of, opposites, this, is, an, absolute, which, he, described, as, an, eternal, act, of, cognition, is, disclosed, in, subjective, and, objective, modes, the, world, of, ideas, and, nature, g, w, f, hegel, also, defended, a, dynamic, absolute, idealism, that, sees, existence, as, an, all, inclusive, whole, however, his, system, differs, from, his, predecessors, in, that, it, is, not, grounded, on, some, initial, subject, mind, or, i, and, tries, to, move, beyond, all, bifurcation, subject, and, object, of, the, dualism, between, thinking, and, being, which, for, hegel, just, leads, to, various, contradictions, as, such, hegel, s, system, is, an, ontological, monism, fundamentally, based, on, on, a, unity, between, being, and, thought, subject, and, object, which, he, saw, as, being, neither, materialistic, realism, nor, subjective, idealism, which, still, stands, in, an, opposition, to, materialism, and, thus, remains, stuck, in, the, subject, object, distinction, in, his, phenomenology, of, spirit, 1807, hegel, provides, an, epistemological, argument, for, idealism, focusing, on, proving, the, metaphysical, priority, of, identities, over, and, against, their, opposed, elements, hegel, s, argument, begins, with, his, conception, of, knowledge, which, he, holds, is, a, relation, between, a, claim, about, a, subject, and, an, object, that, allows, for, a, correspondence, between, their, structural, features, and, is, thus, a, type, of, correspondence, theory, hegel, argues, that, if, knowledge, is, possible, real, objects, must, also, have, a, similar, structure, as, thought, without, however, being, reduced, to, thoughts, if, not, there, could, be, no, correspondence, between, what, the, object, is, and, what, a, subject, believes, to, be, true, about, the, object, for, hegel, any, system, in, which, the, subject, that, knows, and, the, object, which, is, known, are, structurally, independent, would, make, the, relations, necessary, for, knowledge, impossible, hegel, also, argues, that, finite, qualities, and, objects, depend, on, other, finite, things, to, determine, them, an, infinite, thinking, being, on, the, other, hand, would, be, more, self, determining, and, hence, most, fully, real, hegel, argued, that, a, careful, analysis, of, the, act, of, knowledge, would, eventually, lead, to, an, understanding, of, the, unity, of, subjects, and, the, objects, in, a, single, all, encompassing, whole, in, this, system, experiences, are, not, independent, of, the, thing, in, itself, as, in, kant, but, are, manifestations, grounded, in, a, metaphysical, absolute, which, is, also, experiential, but, since, it, resists, the, experiential, subject, can, be, known, through, this, resistance, thus, our, own, experiences, can, lead, us, to, an, insight, into, the, thing, in, itself, furthermore, since, reality, is, a, unity, all, knowledge, is, ultimately, self, knowledge, or, as, hegel, puts, it, it, is, the, subject, being, in, the, other, with, itself, im, anderen, bei, sich, selbst, sein, since, all, things, have, spirit, geist, a, philosopher, can, attain, what, he, termed, absolute, knowing, absolutes, wissen, which, is, the, knowledge, that, all, things, are, ultimately, manifestations, of, an, infinite, absolute, spirit, later, in, his, science, of, logic, 1812, 1814, hegel, further, develops, a, metaphysics, in, which, the, real, and, objective, activity, of, thinking, unfolds, itself, in, numerous, ways, as, objects, and, subjects, this, ultimate, activity, of, thought, which, is, not, the, activity, of, specific, subjects, is, an, immediate, fact, a, given, vorhandenes, which, is, self, standing, and, self, organizing, in, manifesting, the, entire, world, the, absolute, enacts, a, process, of, self, actualization, through, a, grand, structure, or, master, logic, which, is, what, hegel, calls, reason, vernunft, and, which, he, understands, as, a, teleological, reality, hegelianism, was, deeply, influential, throughout, the, 19th, century, even, as, some, hegelians, like, marx, rejected, idealism, later, idealist, hegelians, include, friedrich, adolf, trendelenburg, 1802, 72, and, rudolf, hermann, lotze, 1817, 81, the, philosophy, of, arthur, schopenhauer, owes, much, to, the, thought, of, kant, and, to, that, of, the, german, idealists, which, he, nevertheless, strongly, criticizes, schopenhauer, maintains, kant, s, idealist, epistemology, which, sees, even, space, time, and, causality, are, mere, mental, representations, vorstellungen, conditioned, by, the, subjective, mind, however, he, replaces, kant, s, unknowable, thing, in, itself, with, an, absolute, reality, underlying, all, ideas, that, is, a, single, irrational, will, a, view, that, he, saw, as, directly, opposed, to, hegel, s, rational, spirit, this, philosophy, is, laid, out, in, the, world, as, will, and, representation, wwr, 1818, 2nd, ed, 1844, schopenhauer, accepts, kant, s, view, that, there, can, be, no, appearances, without, there, being, something, which, appears, however, unlike, kant, schopenhauer, writes, that, we, have, immediate, cognition, of, the, thing, in, itself, when, it, appears, to, us, as, our, own, body, wwr, 6, pp, 40, 1, schopenhauer, argues, that, even, though, we, do, experience, our, own, bodies, through, the, categories, of, space, time, and, causality, we, also, experience, it, in, another, more, direct, and, internal, way, through, the, experience, of, willing, this, immediate, experience, reveals, that, it, is, will, alone, which, gives, him, the, key, to, his, own, appearance, reveals, to, him, the, meaning, and, shows, him, the, inner, workings, of, his, essence, his, deeds, his, movements, wwr, 18, p, 124, thus, for, schopenhauer, it, is, desire, a, dark, dull, driving, which, is, at, the, root, of, action, not, reason, furthermore, since, this, is, the, only, form, of, insight, we, have, of, the, inner, essence, of, any, reality, we, must, apply, this, insight, to, appearances, in, the, inorganic, world, as, well, schopenhauer, compares, willing, with, many, natural, forces, as, such, will, is, a, name, signifying, the, being, in, itself, of, every, thing, in, the, world, and, the, sole, kernel, of, every, appearance, wwr, 23, pp, 142, 3, because, irrational, willing, is, the, most, foundational, reality, life, is, filled, with, frustration, irrationality, and, disappointment, this, is, the, metaphysical, foundation, of, schopenhauer, s, pessimistic, philosophy, of, life, the, best, we, can, hope, for, is, to, deny, and, try, to, escape, however, briefly, the, incessant, force, of, the, will, through, art, aesthetic, experience, asceticism, and, compassion, actual, idealism, is, a, form, of, idealism, developed, by, giovanni, gentile, which, argues, that, reality, is, the, ongoing, act, of, thinking, or, in, italian, pensiero, pensante, and, thus, only, thoughts, exist, he, further, argued, that, our, combined, thoughts, defined, and, produced, reality, gentile, also, nationalizes, this, idea, holding, that, the, state, is, a, composition, of, many, minds, coming, together, to, construct, reality, giovanni, gentile, was, a, key, supporter, of, fascism, regarded, by, many, as, the, philosopher, of, fascism, his, idealist, theory, argued, for, the, unity, of, all, society, under, one, leader, which, allows, it, to, act, as, one, body, idealism, was, widespread, in, anglo, american, philosophy, during, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, it, was, the, dominant, metaphysics, in, the, english, speaking, world, during, the, last, decades, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, during, this, time, the, defenders, of, british, idealism, made, significant, contributions, to, all, fields, of, philosophy, however, other, philosophers, like, mctaggart, broke, from, this, trend, and, instead, defended, a, pluralistic, idealism, in, which, the, ultimate, reality, is, a, plurality, of, minds, many, anglo, american, idealists, were, influenced, by, hegelianism, but, they, also, drew, on, kant, plato, and, aristotle, key, figures, of, this, transatlantic, movement, include, many, of, the, british, idealists, such, as, t, h, green, 1836, 1882, f, h, bradley, 1846, 1924, bernard, bosanquet, 1848, 1923, j, h, muirhead, 1855, 1940, h, h, joachim, 1868, 1938, a, e, taylor, 1869, 1945, r, g, collingwood, 1889, 1943, g, r, g, mure, 1893, 1979, and, michael, oakeshott, american, idealist, philosophers, include, josiah, royce, 1855, 1916, and, brand, blanshard, 1892, 1987, one, of, the, early, influential, british, idealists, was, thomas, hill, green, known, for, his, posthumous, prolegomena, to, ethics, green, argues, for, an, idealist, metaphysics, in, this, text, as, a, foundation, for, free, will, and, ethics, in, a, kantian, fashion, green, first, argues, that, knowledge, consists, in, seeing, relations, in, consciousness, and, that, any, sense, of, something, being, real, or, objective, has, no, meaning, outside, of, consciousness, he, then, argues, that, experience, as, consciousness, of, related, events, cannot, be, explained, by, any, natural, history, properly, so, called, and, thus, the, understanding, which, presents, an, order, of, nature, to, us, is, in, principle, one, with, an, understanding, which, constitutes, that, order, itself, green, then, further, argues, that, individual, human, beings, are, aware, of, an, order, of, relations, which, extends, beyond, the, bounds, of, their, individual, mind, for, green, this, greater, order, must, be, in, a, larger, transpersonal, intelligence, while, the, world, is, a, system, of, related, facts, which, is, made, possible, and, revealed, to, individual, beings, by, the, larger, intelligence, furthermore, green, also, holds, that, participation, in, the, transpersonal, mind, is, constituted, by, the, apprehension, of, a, portion, of, the, overall, order, by, animal, organisms, as, such, green, accepts, the, reality, of, biological, bodies, when, he, writes, that, in, the, process, of, our, learning, to, know, the, world, an, animal, organism, which, has, its, history, in, time, gradually, becomes, the, vehicle, of, an, eternally, complete, consciousness, another, paradigmatic, british, absolute, idealist, is, francis, herbert, bradley, who, affirms, that, the, absolute, is, not, many, there, are, no, independent, reals, this, absolute, reality, is, one, system, and, its, contents, are, nothing, but, sentient, experience, it, will, hence, be, a, single, and, all, inclusive, experience, which, embraces, every, partial, diversity, in, concord, bradley, presents, an, anti, realist, idealism, which, rejects, the, ultimate, reality, of, relations, which, for, him, are, mere, appearance, a, makeshift, a, mere, practical, compromise, most, necessary, but, in, the, end, most, indefensible, bradley, presented, his, idealism, in, his, appearance, and, reality, 1893, by, arguing, that, the, ideas, we, use, to, understand, reality, are, contradictory, he, deconstructs, numerous, ideas, including, primary, and, secondary, qualities, substances, and, attributes, quality, and, relation, space, time, and, causality, and, the, self, most, famously, bradley, argued, that, any, ultimate, distinction, between, qualities, and, relations, is, untenable, since, qualities, are, nothing, without, relations, since, their, plurality, depends, on, relation, and, without, that, relation, they, are, not, distinct, but, if, not, distinct, then, not, different, and, therefore, not, qualities, furthermore, for, bradley, the, same, thing, turns, out, to, be, true, of, relations, and, of, both, taken, together, since, for, a, relation, to, relate, to, a, quality, it, would, then, require, a, further, relation, as, such, qualities, and, relations, are, appearance, not, ultimate, truth, since, ultimate, reality, is, such, that, it, does, not, contradict, itself, even, though, all, appearances, are, not, truth, it, is, still, possible, to, have, true, knowledge, of, ultimate, reality, which, must, be, a, unity, beyond, contradictions, but, which, still, allows, for, diversity, bradley, thinks, that, this, character, of, reality, as, a, diverse, unity, is, revealed, to, us, in, sentient, experience, since, our, various, experiences, must, be, grounded, and, caused, by, some, undifferentiated, and, pre, abstract, reality, however, he, also, admits, our, complete, inability, to, understand, this, concrete, unity, in, detail, idealism, also, became, popular, in, the, united, states, with, thinkers, like, charles, sanders, peirce, 1839, 1914, who, defended, an, objective, idealism, in, which, as, he, put, it, matter, is, effete, mind, inveterate, habits, becoming, physical, laws, pierce, initially, defended, a, type, of, representationalism, alongside, his, form, of, pragmatism, which, was, metaphysically, neutral, since, it, is, no, doctrine, of, metaphysics, however, in, later, years, after, c, 1905, pierce, defended, an, objective, idealism, which, held, that, the, universe, evolved, from, a, state, of, maximum, spontaneous, freedom, which, he, associated, with, mind, into, its, present, state, where, matter, were, merely, congealed, mind, in, arguing, for, this, view, he, followed, the, classic, idealist, premise, that, states, there, must, be, a, metaphysical, equality, an, isomorphism, between, thought, and, being, and, as, such, the, root, of, all, being, is, one, a, key, feature, of, pierce, s, idealism, is, tychism, which, he, defined, as, the, doctrine, that, absolute, chance, is, a, factor, of, the, universe, this, allows, for, an, element, of, chance, or, indeterminism, in, the, universe, which, allows, for, cosmological, evolution, under, the, influence, of, pierce, it, was, josiah, royce, 1855, 1916, who, became, the, leading, american, idealist, at, the, turn, of, the, century, royce, s, idealism, incorporated, aspects, of, pierce, s, pragmatism, and, is, defended, in, his, the, spirit, of, modern, philosophy, 1892, one, of, royce, s, arguments, for, idealism, is, his, argument, from, meaning, which, states, the, possibility, of, there, being, meaning, at, all, requires, an, identity, between, what, is, meant, ordinary, objects, and, what, makes, meaning, ordinary, subjects, in, his, the, world, and, the, individual, 2, vols, 1899, and, 1901, royce, also, links, meaning, with, purpose, seeing, the, meaning, of, a, term, as, its, intended, purpose, royce, was, an, absolute, idealist, who, held, that, ultimately, reality, was, a, super, self, an, absolute, mind, royce, argues, that, for, a, mind, to, be, able, represent, itself, and, its, representations, and, not, lead, to, a, vicious, infinite, regress, it, must, be, complex, and, capacious, enough, and, only, an, absolute, mind, has, this, capacity, the, american, philosopher, brand, blanshard, 1892, 1987, was, also, a, proponent, of, idealism, who, accepted, a, necessary, isomorphism, between, knowledge, and, its, object, his, idealism, is, most, obvious, in, the, nature, of, thought, 1939, where, he, discusses, how, all, perception, is, infused, with, concepts, he, then, argues, from, a, coherence, theory, of, truth, that, the, character, of, reality, must, also, include, coherence, itself, and, thus, knowledge, must, be, similar, to, what, it, knows, not, only, that, but, knowledge, must, be, part, of, a, single, system, with, the, world, it, knows, and, causal, relations, must, be, also, involve, logical, relations, these, considerations, lead, to, an, idealism, which, sees, the, world, as, system, of, relations, that, cannot, be, merely, physical, pluralistic, idealism, takes, the, view, that, there, are, many, individual, minds, monads, or, processes, that, together, underlie, the, existence, of, the, observed, world, and, which, make, possible, the, existence, of, the, physical, universe, pluralistic, idealism, does, not, assume, the, existence, of, a, single, ultimate, mind, or, absolute, as, with, the, total, monism, of, absolute, idealism, instead, it, affirms, an, ultimate, plurality, of, ideas, or, beings, personalism, is, the, view, that, the, individual, minds, of, persons, or, selves, are, the, basis, for, ultimate, reality, and, value, and, as, such, emphasizes, the, fundamentality, and, inherent, worth, of, persons, modern, personalist, idealism, emerged, during, the, reaction, against, what, was, seen, as, a, dehumanizing, impersonalism, of, absolute, idealism, a, reaction, which, was, led, by, figures, like, hermann, lotze, 1817, 1881, personalists, affirmed, personal, freedom, against, what, they, saw, as, a, monism, that, lead, to, totalitarianism, by, subordinating, the, individual, to, the, collective, some, idealistic, personalists, defended, a, theistic, personalism, often, influenced, by, aquinas, in, which, reality, is, a, society, of, minds, ultimately, dependent, on, a, supreme, person, god, defenders, of, a, theistic, and, idealistic, personalism, include, borden, parker, bowne, 1847, 1910, andrew, seth, pringle, pattison, 1856, 1931, edgar, s, brightman, and, george, holmes, howison, 1834, 1916, these, theistic, personalists, emphasize, the, dependence, of, all, individual, minds, on, god, however, other, personalists, like, british, idealist, j, m, e, mctaggart, and, thomas, davidson, merely, argued, for, a, community, of, individual, minds, or, spirits, without, positing, a, supreme, personal, deity, who, creates, or, grounds, them, similarly, james, ward, 1843, 1925, was, inspired, by, leibniz, to, defend, a, form, of, pluralistic, idealism, in, which, the, universe, is, composed, of, psychic, monads, of, different, levels, interacting, for, mutual, self, betterment, american, personalism, was, particularly, associated, with, idealism, and, with, boston, university, where, bowne, who, had, studied, with, lotze, developed, his, personalist, idealism, and, published, his, personalism, 1908, bowne, s, students, like, edgar, sheffield, brightman, albert, c, knudson, 1873, 1953, francis, j, mcconnell, 1871, 1953, and, ralph, t, flewelling, 1871, 1960, continued, to, develop, his, personal, idealism, after, his, death, the, boston, personalism, tradition, also, influenced, the, late, rwork, of, peter, a, bertocci, 1910, 1989, as, well, as, the, ideas, of, martin, luther, king, jr, who, studied, at, boston, university, with, personalist, philosophers, and, was, shaped, by, their, worldview, george, holmes, howison, meanwhile, developed, his, own, brand, of, california, personalism, howison, argued, that, both, impersonal, monistic, idealism, and, materialism, run, contrary, to, the, experience, of, moral, freedom, while, personal, idealism, affirms, it, to, deny, freedom, to, pursue, truth, beauty, and, benignant, love, is, to, undermine, every, profound, human, venture, including, science, morality, and, philosophy, howison, in, his, book, the, limits, of, evolution, and, other, essays, illustrating, the, metaphysical, theory, of, personal, idealism, developed, a, democratic, idealism, that, extended, all, the, way, to, god, who, instead, of, a, monarch, was, seen, as, the, ultimate, democrat, in, eternal, relation, to, other, eternal, persons, another, pluralistic, idealism, was, thomas, davidson, s, 1840, 1900, apeirotheism, which, he, defined, as, a, theory, of, gods, infinite, in, number, the, theory, was, indebted, to, aristotle, s, view, of, the, eternal, rational, soul, and, the, nous, identifying, aristotle, s, god, with, rational, thought, davidson, argued, contrary, to, aristotle, that, just, as, the, soul, cannot, exist, apart, from, the, body, god, cannot, exist, apart, from, the, world, another, influential, british, idealist, j, m, e, mctaggart, 1866, 1925, defended, a, theory, in, which, reality, is, a, community, of, individual, spirits, connected, by, the, relation, of, love, mctaggart, defends, ontological, idealism, through, a, mereological, argument, which, argues, only, spirits, can, be, substances, as, well, as, through, an, argument, for, the, unreality, of, time, a, position, he, also, defends, in, the, unreality, of, time, in, the, nature, of, existence, 1927, mctaggart, s, argument, relies, on, the, premise, that, substances, are, infinitely, divisible, and, cannot, have, simple, parts, furthermore, each, of, their, infinite, parts, determines, every, other, part, he, then, analyzes, various, characteristics, of, reality, such, as, time, matter, sensation, and, cogitation, and, attempts, to, show, they, cannot, be, real, elements, of, real, substances, but, must, be, mere, appearances, for, example, the, existence, of, matter, cannot, be, inferred, based, on, sensations, since, they, cannot, be, divided, to, infinity, and, thus, cannot, be, substances, spirits, on, the, other, hand, are, true, infinitely, divisible, substances, they, have, the, quality, of, having, content, all, of, which, is, the, content, of, one, or, more, selves, and, know, themselves, through, direct, perception, as, substances, persisting, through, time, for, mctaggart, there, is, a, multiplicity, of, spirits, which, are, nevertheless, related, to, each, other, harmoniously, through, their, love, for, each, other, mctaggart, also, criticizes, hegel, s, view, of, the, state, in, his, studies, in, hegelian, cosmology, 1901, arguing, that, metaphysics, can, give, very, little, guidance, to, social, and, political, action, just, like, it, can, give, us, very, little, guidance, in, other, practical, matters, like, engineering, in, the, western, world, the, popularity, of, idealism, as, a, metaphysical, view, declined, severely, in, the, 20th, century, especially, in, english, language, analytic, philosophy, this, was, partly, due, to, the, criticisms, of, british, philosophers, like, g, e, moore, and, bertrand, russell, and, also, due, to, the, critiques, of, the, american, new, realists, like, e, b, holt, ralph, barton, perry, and, roy, wood, sellars, moore, famously, critiqued, idealism, and, defended, realism, in, the, refutation, of, idealism, 1903, and, a, defence, of, common, sense, 1925, in, the, refutation, moore, argues, that, arguments, for, idealism, most, often, rely, on, the, premise, that, to, be, is, to, be, perceived, esse, est, percipi, but, that, if, this, is, true, how, can, we, infer, that, anything, whatever, let, alone, everything, is, an, inseparable, aspect, of, any, experience, bertrand, russell, s, popular, 1912, book, the, problems, of, philosophy, also, contained, a, similar, critique, their, main, objection, is, that, idealists, falsely, presuppose, that, the, mind, s, relation, to, any, object, is, a, necessary, condition, for, the, existence, of, the, object, russell, thinks, this, fallacy, fails, to, make, the, distinction, between, act, and, object, in, our, apprehending, of, things, 1912, guyer, et, al, write, that, the, success, of, these, arguments, might, be, controversial, and, that, the, charge, that, they, simply, conflate, knowledge, and, object, hardly, seems, to, do, justice, to, the, elaborate, arguments, of, the, late, nineteenth, century, idealists, it, also, relies, on, a, realist, epistemology, in, which, knowledge, stands, in, an, immediate, relation, to, an, independent, individual, object, regarding, positive, arguments, moore, s, most, famous, argument, for, the, existence, of, external, matter, found, in, proof, of, an, external, world, 1939, was, an, epistemological, argument, from, common, sense, facts, sometimes, known, as, here, is, one, hand, idealism, was, also, more, recently, critiqued, in, the, works, of, australian, philosopher, david, stove, and, by, alan, musgrave, and, john, searle, today, idealism, remains, a, minority, view, in, western, analytic, circles, in, spite, of, this, the, study, of, the, work, of, the, anglo, american, idealists, saw, a, revival, in, the, 21st, century, with, an, increase, in, publications, at, the, turn, of, the, century, and, they, are, now, considered, to, have, made, important, contributions, to, philosophy, several, modern, figures, continue, to, defend, idealism, recent, idealist, philosophers, include, a, a, luce, sense, without, matter, 1954, timothy, sprigge, the, vindication, of, absolute, idealism, 1984, leslie, armour, vittorio, h, sle, objective, idealism, 1998, john, andrew, foster, a, world, for, us, 2008, john, a, leslie, infinite, minds, a, philosophical, cosmology, 2002, and, bernardo, kastrup, the, idea, of, the, world, 2018, in, 2022, howard, robinson, authored, perception, and, idealism, both, foster, and, sprigge, defend, idealism, through, an, epistemic, argument, for, the, unity, of, the, act, of, perception, with, its, object, sprigge, also, made, an, argument, from, grounding, which, held, that, our, phenomenal, objects, presuppose, some, noumenal, ground, as, such, for, sprigge, the, physical, world, consists, in, innumerable, mutually, interacting, centres, of, experience, or, what, comes, to, the, same, of, pulses, and, flows, of, experience, thus, the, noumenal, ground, is, the, totality, of, all, experiences, which, are, one, concrete, universal, that, resembles, bradley, s, absolute, helen, yetter, chappell, has, defended, nontheistic, quasi, berkeleyan, idealism, idealist, notions, took, a, strong, hold, among, physicists, of, the, early, 20th, century, confronted, with, the, paradoxes, of, quantum, physics, and, the, theory, of, relativity, in, the, grammar, of, science, preface, to, the, 2nd, edition, 1900, karl, pearson, wrote, there, are, many, signs, that, a, sound, idealism, is, surely, replacing, as, a, basis, for, natural, philosophy, the, crude, materialism, of, the, older, physicists, this, book, influenced, einstein, s, regard, for, the, importance, of, the, observer, in, scientific, measurements, in, 5, of, that, book, pearson, asserted, that, science,
