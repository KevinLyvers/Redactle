throughout, ireland, but, there, are, numerous, regional, variants, john, o, donovan, s, supplement, to, o, reilly, s, irish, english, dictionary, defines, lugharc, n, lugrac, n, luprac, n, as, a, sprite, a, pigmy, a, fairy, of, a, diminutive, size, who, always, carries, a, purse, containing, a, shilling, the, irish, term, leithbr, gan, in, o, reilly, s, dictionary, has, also, been, recognized, as, an, alternative, spelling, other, variant, spellings, in, english, have, included, lubrican, leprehaun, and, lepreehawn, some, modern, irish, books, use, the, spelling, lioprach, n, the, first, recorded, instance, of, the, word, in, the, english, language, was, in, dekker, s, comedy, the, honest, whore, part, 2, 1604, as, for, your, irish, lubrican, that, spirit, whom, by, preposterous, charms, thy, lust, hath, rais, d, in, a, wrong, circle, the, word, may, have, been, coined, as, a, compound, of, the, roots, l, or, laghu, from, greek, small, and, corp, from, latin, corpus, body, or, so, it, had, been, suggested, by, whitley, stokes, research, published, in, 2019, suggests, the, word, derives, from, the, luperci, and, associated, roman, festival, of, lupercalia, folk, etymology, derives, the, word, from, leith, half, and, br, g, brogue, because, of, the, frequent, portrayal, of, the, leprechaun, as, working, on, a, single, shoe, as, evident, in, the, alternative, spelling, leithbr, gan, the, earliest, known, reference, to, the, leprechaun, appears, in, the, medieval, tale, known, as, the, echtra, fergus, mac, l, ti, adventure, of, fergus, son, of, l, ti, the, saga, exists, in, two, widely, divergent, versions, the, first, of, these, is, written, in, dublin, trinity, college, ms, 1337, pp, 363b, 365a, better, known, as, h, 3, 18, cih, iii, 882, 4, 883, 28, and, has, been, dated, to, the, eighth, century, binchy, 1952, the, second, version, is, a, copy, of, the, 8th, century, text, written, on, a, single, leaf, inserted, into, london, british, library, ms, harley, 432, f, 5, cih, ii, 354, 28, 355, 41, the, saga, was, rewritten, in, the, 13th, century, as, a, burlesque, version, the, text, contains, an, episode, in, which, fergus, mac, l, ti, king, of, ulster, falls, asleep, on, the, beach, and, wakes, to, find, himself, being, dragged, into, the, sea, by, three, l, chorp, in, he, captures, his, abductors, who, grant, him, three, wishes, in, exchange, for, release, the, leprechaun, is, said, to, be, a, solitary, creature, whose, principal, occupation, is, making, and, cobbling, shoes, and, who, enjoys, practical, jokes, in, mcanally, s, 1888, account, the, leprechaun, was, not, a, professional, cobbler, but, was, frequently, seen, mending, his, own, shoes, as, he, runs, about, so, much, he, wears, them, out, with, great, frequency, this, is, he, claims, the, perfect, opportunity, for, a, human, being, to, capture, the, leprechaun, refusing, to, release, him, until, the, leprechaun, gives, his, captor, supernatural, wealth, the, leprechaun, has, been, classed, as, a, solitary, fairy, by, the, writer, and, amateur, folklorist, william, butler, yeats, yeats, was, part, of, the, revivalist, literary, movement, greatly, influential, in, calling, attention, to, the, leprechaun, in, the, late, 19th, century, this, classification, by, yeats, is, derived, from, d, r, mcanally, irish, wonders, 1888, derived, in, turn, from, john, o, hanlon, 1870, it, is, stressed, that, the, leprechaun, though, some, may, call, it, fairy, is, clearly, to, be, distinguished, from, the, aos, s, or, the, good, people, of, the, fairy, mounds, sidhe, and, raths, leprachaun, being, solitary, is, one, distinguishing, characteristic, but, additionally, the, leprachaun, is, thought, to, only, engage, in, pranks, on, the, level, of, mischief, and, requiring, special, caution, but, in, contrast, the, aos, s, may, carry, out, deeds, more, menacing, to, humans, e, g, the, spiriting, away, of, children, this, identification, of, leprechaun, as, a, fairy, has, been, consigned, to, popular, notion, by, modern, folklorist, diarmuid, gioll, in, gioll, in, observes, that, the, dwarf, of, teutonic, and, other, traditions, as, well, as, the, household, familiar, are, more, amenable, to, comparison, according, to, william, butler, yeats, the, great, wealth, of, the, leprechauns, comes, from, the, treasure, crocks, buried, of, old, in, war, time, which, they, have, uncovered, and, appropriated, according, to, david, russell, mcanally, the, leprechaun, is, the, son, of, an, evil, spirit, and, a, degenerate, fairy, and, is, not, wholly, good, nor, wholly, evil, the, leprechaun, originally, had, a, different, appearance, depending, on, where, in, ireland, he, was, found, before, the, 20th, century, it, was, generally, held, that, the, leprechaun, wore, red, not, green, samuel, lover, writing, in, 1831, describes, the, leprechaun, as, quite, a, beau, in, his, dress, notwithstanding, for, he, wears, a, red, square, cut, coat, richly, laced, with, gold, and, inexpressible, of, the, same, cocked, hat, shoes, and, buckles, according, to, yeats, the, solitary, fairies, like, the, leprechaun, wear, red, jackets, whereas, the, trooping, fairies, wear, green, yeats, leprechaun, wore, a, jacket, with, seven, rows, of, buttons, with, seven, buttons, to, each, row, yeats, describes, that, on, the, western, coast, the, red, jacket, is, covered, by, a, frieze, one, whereas, in, ulster, the, creature, wears, a, cocked, hat, and, when, he, is, up, to, anything, unusually, mischievous, he, leaps, onto, a, wall, and, spins, balancing, himself, on, the, point, of, the, hat, with, his, heels, in, the, air, according, to, mcanally, the, universal, leprechaun, is, described, as, follows, he, is, about, three, feet, high, and, is, dressed, in, a, little, red, jacket, or, roundabout, with, red, breeches, buckled, at, the, knee, gray, or, black, stockings, and, a, hat, cocked, in, the, style, of, a, century, ago, over, a, little, old, withered, face, round, his, neck, is, an, elizabethan, ruff, and, frills, of, lace, are, at, his, wrists, on, the, wild, west, coast, where, the, atlantic, winds, bring, almost, constant, rains, he, dispenses, with, ruff, and, frills, and, wears, a, frieze, overcoat, over, his, pretty, red, suit, so, that, unless, on, the, lookout, for, the, cocked, hat, ye, might, pass, a, leprechawn, on, the, road, and, never, know, it, s, himself, that, s, in, it, at, all, this, dress, varied, by, region, in, mcanally, s, account, there, were, differences, between, leprechauns, or, logherymans, from, different, regions, in, a, poem, entitled, the, lepracaun, or, fairy, shoemaker, 18th, century, irish, poet, william, allingham, describes, the, appearance, of, the, leprechaun, as, a, wrinkled, wizen, d, and, bearded, elf, spectacles, stuck, on, his, pointed, nose, silver, buckles, to, his, hose, leather, apron, shoe, in, his, lap, the, modern, image, of, the, leprechaun, sitting, on, a, toadstool, having, a, red, beard, and, green, hat, etc, is, a, more, modern, invention, or, borrowed, from, other, strands, of, european, folklore, the, most, likely, explanation, for, the, modern, day, leprechaun, appearance, is, that, green, is, a, traditional, national, irish, color, dating, back, as, far, as, 1642, the, hat, might, be, derived, from, the, style, of, outdated, fashion, still, common, in, ireland, in, the, 19th, century, this, style, of, fashion, was, commonly, worn, by, irish, immigrants, to, the, united, states, since, some, elizabethan, era, clothes, were, still, common, in, ireland, in, the, 19th, century, long, after, they, were, out, of, fashion, as, depicted, by, the, stage, irish, the, buckle, shoes, and, other, garments, also, have, their, origin, in, the, elizabethan, period, in, ireland, the, leprechaun, is, similar, to, the, clurichaun, and, the, far, darrig, in, that, he, is, a, solitary, creature, some, writers, even, go, as, far, as, to, substitute, these, second, two, less, well, known, spirits, for, the, leprechaun, in, stories, or, tales, to, reach, a, wider, audience, the, clurichaun, is, considered, by, some, to, be, merely, a, leprechaun, on, a, drinking, spree, in, the, politics, of, the, republic, of, ireland, leprechauns, have, been, used, to, refer, to, the, twee, aspects, of, the, tourism, field, in, ireland, this, can, be, seen, from, this, example, of, john, a, costello, addressing, the, oireachtas, in, 1963, for, many, years, we, were, afflicted, with, the, miserable, trivialities, of, our, tourist, advertising, sometimes, it, descended, to, the, lowest, depths, to, the, caubeen, and, the, shillelagh, not, to, speak, of, the, leprechaun, films, animated, cartoons, and, advertising, have, popularised, a, specific, image, of, leprechauns, which, bears, little, resemblance, to, anything, found, in, the, cycles, of, irish, folklore, some, argue, that, the, popularised, image, of, the, leprechaun, is, little, more, than, a, series, of, stereotypes, based, on, derogatory, anti, irish, 19th, century, caricatures, many, celtic, music, groups, have, used, the, term, leprechaun, as, part, of, their, naming, convention, or, as, an, album, title, some, popular, forms, of, american, music, including, heavy, metal, celtic, metal, punk, rock, and, jazz, have, also, made, use, of, the, mythological, character, famous, leprechaun, characters, include, nobel, prize, winning, economist, paul, krugman, coined, the, term, leprechaun, economics, to, describe, distorted, or, unsound, economic, data, which, he, first, used, in, a, tweet, on, 12, july, 2016, in, response, to, the, publication, by, the, irish, central, statistics, office, cso, that, irish, gdp, had, grown, by, 26, 3, and, irish, gnp, had, grown, by, 18, 7, in, the, 2015, irish, national, accounts, the, growth, was, subsequently, shown, to, be, due, to, apple, restructuring, its, double, irish, tax, scheme, which, the, eu, commission, had, fined, 13bn, in, 2004, 2014, irish, unpaid, taxes, the, largest, corporate, tax, fine, in, history, the, term, has, been, used, many, times, since, in, the, u, s, leprechauns, are, often, associated, with, st, patrick, s, day, along, with, the, color, green, and, shamrocks, the, disney, film, darby, o, gill, and, the, little, people, 1959, based, on, herminie, templeton, kavanagh, s, darby, o, gill, books, which, features, a, leprechaun, king, is, a, work, in, which, fergus, mac, l, ti, was, featured, parenthetically, in, the, film, the, captured, leprechaun, king, grants, three, wishes, like, fergus, in, the, saga, while, the, film, project, was, in, development, walt, disney, was, in, contact, with, and, consulting, s, amus, delargy, and, the, irish, folklore, commission, but, never, asked, for, leprechaun, material, even, though, a, large, folkloric, repository, on, such, subject, was, housed, by, the, commission
