chinese, pinyin, zh, n, compassion, chinese, pinyin, sh, n, and, forbearance, chinese, pinyin, r, n, these, principles, have, been, repeated, by, falun, gong, members, to, outsiders, as, a, tactic, for, evading, deeper, inquiry, and, followers, have, been, instructed, by, li, to, lie, about, the, practice, 6, together, these, principles, are, regarded, as, the, fundamental, nature, of, the, cosmos, the, criteria, for, differentiating, right, from, wrong, and, are, held, to, be, the, highest, manifestations, of, the, tao, adherence, to, and, cultivation, of, these, virtues, is, regarded, as, a, fundamental, part, of, falun, gong, practice, in, zhuan, falun, the, foundational, text, published, in, 1995, li, hongzhi, writes, it, doesn, t, matter, how, mankind, s, moral, standard, changes, the, nature, of, the, cosmos, doesn, t, change, and, it, is, the, only, standard, for, determining, who, s, good, and, who, s, bad, so, to, be, a, cultivator, you, have, to, take, the, nature, of, the, cosmos, as, your, guide, for, improving, yourself, practice, of, falun, gong, consists, of, two, features, performance, of, the, exercises, and, the, refinement, of, one, s, xinxing, moral, character, temperament, in, falun, gong, s, central, text, li, states, that, xinxing, includes, virtue, which, is, a, type, of, matter, it, includes, forbearance, it, includes, awakening, to, things, it, includes, giving, up, things, giving, up, all, the, desires, and, all, the, attachments, that, are, found, in, an, ordinary, person, and, you, also, have, to, endure, hardship, to, name, just, a, few, things, the, elevation, of, one, s, moral, character, is, achieved, on, the, one, hand, by, aligning, one, s, life, with, truth, compassion, and, tolerance, and, on, the, other, by, abandoning, desires, and, negative, thoughts, and, behaviors, such, as, greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc, among, the, central, concepts, found, in, the, teachings, of, falun, gong, is, the, existence, of, virtue, chinese, pinyin, d, and, karma, chinese, pinyin, y, the, former, is, generated, through, doing, good, deeds, and, suffering, while, the, latter, is, accumulated, through, doing, wrong, deeds, a, person, s, ratio, of, karma, to, virtue, is, said, to, determine, their, fortunes, in, this, life, or, the, next, while, virtue, engenders, good, fortune, and, enables, spiritual, transformation, an, accumulation, of, karma, results, in, suffering, illness, and, alienation, from, the, nature, of, the, universe, spiritual, elevation, is, achieved, through, the, elimination, of, negative, karma, and, the, accumulation, of, virtue, practitioners, believe, that, through, a, process, of, moral, cultivation, one, can, achieve, tao, and, obtain, special, powers, and, a, level, of, divinity, falun, gong, s, teachings, posit, that, human, beings, are, originally, and, innately, good, even, divine, but, that, they, descended, into, a, realm, of, delusion, and, suffering, after, developing, selfishness, and, accruing, karma, the, practice, holds, that, reincarnation, exists, and, that, different, people, s, reincarnation, processes, are, overseen, by, different, gods, to, re, ascend, and, return, to, the, original, true, self, falun, gong, practitioners, are, supposed, to, assimilate, themselves, to, the, qualities, of, truthfulness, compassion, and, tolerance, let, go, of, attachments, and, desires, and, suffer, to, repay, karma, traditional, chinese, cultural, thought, and, opposition, to, modernity, are, two, focuses, of, li, hongzhi, s, teachings, falun, gong, echoes, traditional, chinese, beliefs, that, humans, are, connected, to, the, universe, through, mind, and, body, and, li, seeks, to, challenge, conventional, mentalities, concerning, the, nature, and, genesis, of, the, universe, time, space, and, the, human, body, the, practice, draws, on, east, asian, mysticism, and, traditional, chinese, medicine, but, claims, to, have, the, power, to, heal, incurable, illnesses, falun, gong, describes, modern, science, as, too, limited, and, views, traditional, chinese, research, and, practice, as, valid, li, says, that, he, is, a, being, who, has, come, to, help, humankind, from, the, destruction, it, could, face, as, the, result, of, rampant, evil, when, asked, if, he, was, a, human, being, li, replied, you, can, think, of, me, as, a, human, being, according, to, the, founder, li, in, his, book, zhuan, falun, he, claims, to, have, cultivated, supernatural, powers, starting, at, age, eight, according, to, radio, france, international, zhuan, falun, also, promises, to, teach, practitioners, to, cultivate, supernatural, powers, such, as, see, through, a, wall, or, into, a, human, body, in, addition, to, its, moral, philosophy, falun, gong, consists, of, four, standing, exercises, and, one, sitting, meditation, the, exercises, are, regarded, as, secondary, to, moral, elevation, though, are, still, an, essential, component, of, falun, gong, cultivation, practice, the, first, exercises, called, buddha, stretching, a, thousand, arms, are, intended, to, facilitate, the, free, flow, of, energy, through, the, body, and, open, up, the, meridians, the, second, exercise, falun, standing, stance, involves, holding, four, static, poses, each, of, which, resembles, holding, a, wheel, for, an, extended, period, the, objective, of, this, exercise, is, to, enhances, wisdom, increases, strength, raises, a, person, s, level, and, strengthens, divine, powers, the, third, penetrating, the, cosmic, extremes, involves, three, sets, of, movements, which, aim, to, enable, the, expulsion, of, bad, energy, e, g, pathogenic, or, black, qi, and, the, absorption, of, good, energy, into, the, body, through, practice, of, this, exercise, the, practitioner, aspires, to, cleanse, and, purify, the, body, the, fourth, exercise, falun, cosmic, orbit, seeks, to, circulate, energy, freely, throughout, the, body, unlike, the, first, through, fourth, exercises, the, fifth, exercise, is, performed, in, the, seated, lotus, position, called, reinforcing, supernatural, powers, it, is, a, meditation, intended, to, be, maintained, as, long, as, possible, falun, gong, exercises, can, be, practiced, individually, or, in, group, settings, and, can, be, performed, for, varying, lengths, of, time, in, accordance, with, the, needs, and, abilities, of, the, individual, practitioner, porter, writes, that, practitioners, of, falun, gong, are, encouraged, to, read, falun, gong, books, and, practice, its, exercises, on, a, regular, basis, preferably, daily, falun, gong, exercises, are, practiced, in, group, settings, in, parks, university, campuses, and, other, public, spaces, in, over, 70, countries, worldwide, and, are, taught, for, free, by, volunteers, in, addition, to, five, exercises, in, 2001, another, meditation, activity, was, introduced, called, sending, righteous, thoughts, which, is, intended, to, reduce, persecution, on, the, spiritual, plane, discussions, of, supernatural, skills, also, feature, prominently, within, the, qigong, movement, and, the, existence, of, these, skills, gained, a, level, of, mainstream, acceptance, in, china, s, scientific, community, in, the, 1980s, 63, 64, falun, gong, s, teachings, hold, that, practitioners, can, acquire, supernatural, skills, through, a, combination, of, moral, cultivation, meditation, and, exercises, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, precognition, clairaudience, telepathy, and, divine, sight, via, the, opening, of, the, third, eye, or, celestial, eye, however, falun, gong, stresses, that, these, powers, can, be, developed, only, as, a, result, of, moral, practice, and, should, not, be, pursued, or, casually, displayed, according, to, david, ownby, falun, gong, teaches, that, pride, in, one, s, abilities, or, the, desire, to, show, off, are, marks, of, dangerous, attachments, and, li, warns, his, followers, not, to, be, distracted, by, the, pursuit, of, such, powers, 117, falun, gong, differentiates, itself, from, buddhist, monastic, traditions, in, that, it, places, great, importance, on, participation, in, the, secular, world, falun, gong, practitioners, are, required, to, maintain, regular, jobs, and, family, lives, to, observe, the, laws, of, their, respective, governments, and, are, instructed, not, to, distance, themselves, from, society, an, exception, is, made, for, buddhist, bhikkhus, and, bhikkhun, s, who, are, permitted, to, continue, a, monastic, lifestyle, while, practicing, falun, gong, as, part, of, its, emphasis, on, ethical, behavior, falun, gong, s, teachings, prescribe, a, strict, personal, morality, for, practitioners, they, are, expected, to, do, good, deeds, and, conduct, themselves, with, patience, and, forbearance, when, encountering, difficulties, for, instance, li, stipulates, that, a, practitioner, of, falun, gong, must, not, hit, back, when, attacked, not, talk, back, when, insulted, in, addition, they, must, abandon, negative, thoughts, and, behaviors, such, as, greed, deception, jealousy, etc, the, teachings, contain, injunctions, against, smoking, and, the, consumption, of, alcohol, as, these, are, considered, addictions, that, are, detrimental, to, health, and, mental, clarity, practitioners, of, falun, gong, are, forbidden, to, kill, living, things, including, animals, for, the, purpose, of, obtaining, food, though, they, are, not, required, to, adopt, a, vegetarian, diet, in, addition, to, these, things, practitioners, of, falun, gong, must, abandon, a, variety, of, worldly, attachments, and, desires, in, the, course, of, cultivation, practice, the, student, of, falun, gong, aims, to, relinquish, the, pursuit, of, fame, monetary, gain, sentimentality, and, other, entanglements, li, s, teachings, repeatedly, emphasize, the, emptiness, of, material, pursuits, although, practitioners, of, falun, gong, are, not, encouraged, to, leave, their, jobs, or, eschew, money, they, are, expected, to, give, up, the, psychological, attachments, to, these, things, falun, gong, doctrine, counsels, against, participation, in, political, or, social, issues, excessive, interest, in, politics, is, viewed, as, an, attachment, to, worldly, power, and, influence, and, falun, gong, aims, for, transcendence, of, such, pursuits, according, to, hu, ping, falun, gong, deals, only, with, purifying, the, individual, through, exercise, and, does, not, touch, on, social, or, national, concerns, it, has, not, suggested, or, even, intimated, a, model, for, social, change, many, religions, pursue, social, reform, to, some, extent, but, there, is, no, such, tendency, evident, in, falun, gong, sexual, desire, and, lust, are, treated, as, attachments, to, be, discarded, though, falun, gong, students, are, still, generally, expected, to, marry, and, have, families, all, sexual, relations, outside, the, confines, of, monogamous, heterosexual, marriage, are, regarded, as, immoral, 211, li, hongzhi, taught, that, homosexuality, makes, one, unworthy, of, being, human, creates, bad, karma, and, is, comparable, to, organized, crime, 285, he, also, taught, that, disgusting, homosexuality, shows, the, dirty, abnormal, psychology, of, the, gay, who, has, lost, his, ability, of, reasoning, and, that, homosexuality, is, a, filthy, deviant, state, of, mind, 283, li, additionally, stated, in, a, 1998, speech, in, switzerland, that, the, gods, first, target, of, annihilation, would, be, homosexuals, although, gay, lesbian, and, bisexual, people, may, practice, falun, gong, founder, li, stated, that, they, must, give, up, the, bad, conduct, of, all, same, sex, sexual, activity, falun, gong, s, cosmology, includes, the, belief, that, different, ethnicities, each, have, a, correspondence, to, their, own, heavens, and, that, individuals, of, mixed, race, lose, some, aspect, of, this, connection, 286, 217, falun, gong, s, teachings, include, belief, in, reincarnation, and, that, one, s, soul, original, spirit, always, maintains, single, racial, identity, despite, having, a, body, of, mixed, race, investigative, journalist, ethan, gutmann, noted, that, interracial, marriage, is, common, in, the, falun, gong, community, li, hongzhi, authored, the, first, book, of, falun, gong, teachings, in, april, 1993, titled, china, falun, gong, or, simply, falun, gong, it, is, an, introductory, text, that, discusses, qigong, falun, gong, s, relationship, to, buddhism, the, principles, of, cultivation, practice, and, the, improvement, of, moral, character, xinxing, the, book, also, provides, illustrations, and, explanations, of, the, exercises, and, meditation, the, main, body, of, teachings, is, articulated, in, the, book, zhuan, falun, published, in, chinese, in, january, 1995, the, book, is, divided, into, nine, lectures, and, was, based, on, edited, transcriptions, of, the, talks, li, gave, throughout, china, in, the, preceding, three, years, falun, gong, texts, have, since, been, translated, into, an, additional, 40, languages, in, addition, to, these, central, texts, li, has, published, several, books, lectures, articles, and, books, of, poetry, which, are, made, available, on, falun, gong, websites, the, falun, gong, teachings, use, numerous, untranslated, chinese, religious, and, philosophical, terms, and, make, frequent, allusion, to, characters, and, incidents, in, chinese, folk, literature, and, concepts, drawn, from, chinese, popular, religion, this, coupled, with, the, literal, translation, style, of, the, texts, which, imitate, the, colloquial, style, of, li, s, speeches, can, make, falun, gong, scriptures, difficult, to, approach, for, westerners, the, main, symbol, of, the, practice, is, the, falun, dharma, wheel, or, dharmacakra, in, sanskrit, in, buddhism, the, dharmacakra, represents, the, completeness, of, the, doctrine, to, turn, the, wheel, of, dharma, zhuan, falun, means, to, preach, the, buddhist, doctrine, and, is, the, title, of, falun, gong, s, main, text, despite, the, invocation, of, buddhist, language, and, symbols, the, law, wheel, as, understood, in, falun, gong, has, distinct, connotations, and, is, held, to, represent, the, universe, it, is, conceptualized, by, an, emblem, consisting, of, one, large, and, four, small, counter, clockwise, swastika, symbols, representing, the, buddha, and, four, small, taiji, yin, yang, symbols, of, the, daoist, tradition, li, situates, his, teaching, of, falun, gong, amidst, the, dharma, ending, period, mo, fa, described, in, buddhist, scriptures, as, an, age, of, moral, decline, when, the, teachings, of, buddhism, would, need, to, be, rectified, the, current, era, is, described, in, falun, gong, s, teachings, as, the, fa, rectification, period, zhengfa, which, might, also, be, translated, as, to, correct, the, dharma, a, time, of, cosmic, transition, and, renewal, the, process, of, fa, rectification, is, necessitated, by, the, moral, decline, and, degeneration, of, life, in, the, universe, and, in, the, post, 1999, context, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, by, the, chinese, government, has, come, to, be, viewed, as, a, tangible, symptom, of, this, moral, decay, through, the, process, of, the, fa, rectification, life, will, be, reordered, according, to, the, moral, and, spiritual, quality, of, each, with, good, people, being, saved, and, ascending, to, higher, spiritual, planes, and, bad, ones, being, eliminated, or, cast, down, in, this, paradigm, li, assumes, the, role, of, rectifying, the, dharma, by, disseminating, through, his, moral, teachings, some, scholars, such, as, maria, hsia, chang, and, susan, palmer, have, described, li, s, rhetoric, about, the, fa, rectification, and, providing, salvation, in, the, final, period, of, the, last, havoc, as, apocalyptic, 91, however, benjamin, penny, a, professor, of, chinese, history, at, the, australian, national, university, argues, that, li, s, teachings, are, better, understood, in, the, context, of, a, buddhist, notion, of, the, cycle, of, the, dharma, or, the, buddhist, law, richard, gunde, wrote, that, unlike, apocalyptic, groups, in, the, west, falun, gong, does, not, fixate, on, death, or, the, end, of, the, world, and, instead, has, a, simple, innocuous, ethical, message, li, hongzhi, does, not, discuss, a, time, of, reckoning, and, has, rejected, predictions, of, an, impending, apocalypse, in, his, teachings, li, in, the, 1990s, repeated, claims, that, aliens, were, responsible, for, scientific, inventions, through, the, manipulation, of, scientists, for, example, in, a, 1999, interview, with, time, li, attributed, the, invention, of, computers, and, airplanes, to, extraterrestrials, as, well, as, war, and, violence, however, his, position, on, aliens, seemed, fairly, inconsistent, to, observers, graeme, lang, and, lu, yunfeng, li, purported, that, in, general, extraterrestrials, disguise, themselves, as, human, in, order, to, corrupt, and, manipulate, humanity, but, some, practitioners, only, believe, that, to, be, metaphorical, in, the, time, interview, li, believed, that, aliens, were, attempting, to, replace, humans, through, a, cloning, process, in, which, human, bodies, would, be, cloned, with, no, soul, so, that, the, aliens, can, replace, the, soul, and, inhabit, human, bodies, which, to, him, are, perfect, scholars, describe, falun, gong, as, a, new, religious, movement, the, organization, is, regularly, featured, in, handbooks, describing, new, religious, movements, while, commonly, described, by, scholars, as, a, new, religious, movement, adherents, may, reject, this, term, yuezhi, zhao, describes, falun, gong, as, a, multifaceted, and, totalizing, movement, that, means, different, things, to, different, people, ranging, from, a, set, of, physical, exercises, and, a, praxis, of, transformation, to, a, moral, philosophy, and, a, new, knowledge, system, in, the, cultural, context, of, china, falun, gong, is, generally, described, either, as, a, system, of, qigong, or, a, type, of, cultivation, practice, xiulian, a, process, by, which, an, individual, seeks, spiritual, perfection, often, through, both, physical, and, moral, conditioning, varieties, of, cultivation, practice, are, found, throughout, chinese, history, spanning, buddhist, daoist, and, confucian, traditions, benjamin, penny, writes, the, best, way, to, describe, falun, gong, is, as, a, cultivation, system, cultivation, systems, have, been, a, feature, of, chinese, life, for, at, least, 2, 500, years, qigong, practices, can, also, be, understood, as, a, part, of, a, broader, tradition, of, cultivation, practice, in, the, west, falun, gong, is, frequently, classified, as, a, religion, on, the, basis, of, its, theological, and, moral, teachings, its, concerns, with, spiritual, cultivation, and, transformation, and, its, extensive, body, of, scripture, falun, gong, practitioners, themselves, have, sometimes, disavowed, this, classification, however, this, rejection, reflects, the, relatively, narrow, definition, of, religion, in, contemporary, china, according, to, david, ownby, religion, in, china, has, been, defined, since, 1912, to, refer, to, world, historical, faiths, that, have, well, developed, institutions, clergy, and, textual, traditions, namely, buddhism, daoism, islam, protestantism, and, catholicism, moreover, if, falun, gong, had, described, itself, as, a, religion, in, china, it, likely, would, have, invited, immediate, suppression, these, historical, and, cultural, circumstances, notwithstanding, the, practice, has, often, been, described, as, a, form, of, chinese, religion, the, performance, arts, group, shen, yun, and, the, media, organization, the, epoch, times, are, the, major, outreach, organizations, of, falun, gong, both, promote, the, spiritual, and, political, teachings, of, falun, gong, they, and, a, variety, of, other, organizations, such, as, new, tang, dynasty, television, ntd, operate, as, extensions, of, falun, gong, these, extensions, promote, the, new, religious, movement, and, its, teachings, in, the, case, of, the, epoch, times, they, also, promote, conspiracy, theories, such, as, qanon, and, anti, vaccine, misinformation, and, far, right, politics, in, both, europe, and, the, united, states, around, the, time, of, the, 2016, united, states, presidential, election, the, epoch, times, began, running, articles, supportive, of, donald, trump, and, critical, of, his, opponents, falun, gong, extensions, have, also, been, active, in, promoting, the, european, radical, right, the, exact, financial, and, structural, connections, between, falun, gong, shen, yun, and, the, epoch, times, remains, unclear, according, to, nbc, news, the, epoch, media, group, along, with, shen, yun, a, dance, troupe, known, for, its, ubiquitous, advertising, and, unsettling, performances, make, up, the, outreach, effort, of, falun, gong, a, relatively, new, spiritual, practice, that, combines, ancient, chinese, meditative, exercises, mysticism, and, often, ultraconservative, cultural, worldviews, falun, gong, s, founder, has, referred, to, epoch, media, group, as, our, media, and, the, group, s, practice, heavily, informs, the, epoch, times, coverage, according, to, former, employees, who, spoke, with, nbc, news, the, epoch, times, digital, production, company, ntd, and, the, heavily, advertised, dance, troupe, shen, yun, make, up, the, nonprofit, network, that, li, calls, our, media, financial, documents, paint, a, complicated, picture, of, more, than, a, dozen, technically, separate, organizations, that, appear, to, share, missions, money, and, executives, though, the, source, of, their, revenue, is, unclear, the, most, recent, financial, records, from, each, organization, paint, a, picture, of, an, overall, business, thriving, in, the, trump, era, according, to, scholar, james, r, lewis, writing, in, 2018, falun, gong, adherents, have, attempted, to, control, english, wikipedia, articles, covering, the, group, and, articles, related, to, it, lewis, highlights, falun, gong, s, extensive, internet, presence, and, how, editors, who, have, to, date, contributed, to, english, wikipedia, entries, associated, with, falun, gong, to, the, point, where, falun, gong, followers, and, or, sympathizers, de, facto, control,

how, the, entries, can, influence, other, media, entities, lewis, notes, also, how, this, fits, in, as, part, of, falun, gong, s, general, media, strategy, such, as, falun, gong, media, like, the,

gong, groups, accepting, material, directly, from, falun, gong, organizations, as, fact, according, to, lewis, has, thus, been, able, to, influence, other, media, via, its, presence, on, the, web,

popularity, among, iranian, protesters, soon, after, its, farsi, version, was, introduced, in, july, 2008, during, the, green, movement, protests, surrounding, the, 2009, election, its, servers, were, overwhelmed, by, iranian, internet, users, in, 2010, the, us, state, department, under, the, obama, administration, offered, a, 1, 5, million, grant, to, the, global, internet, freedom, consortium,

recognized, the, need, for, the, us, government, to, fund, high, performing, technologies, like, ultrasurf, and, freegate, despite, the, stress, it, might, cause, on, the, u, s, china, relationship, but, recommended, the, us, government, diversify, the, technologies, it, funds, in, recent, years, ultrasurf, has, been, a, major, point, of, contention, in, large, part, because, it, is, not, open, source, meaning, that, it, cannot, be, reviewed, by, outside, engineers, for, vulnerabilities, and, back, doors, additionally, as, reported, by, the, verge, since, the, 2000s, the, software, has, drawn, criticism, for, its, content, filtering, which, blocks, pornography, and, its, ability, to, surveil, user, traffic, which, is, often, impossible, by, design, in, competing, tools, although, it, receives, public, funding, both, its, creators, and, owners, have, rejected, attempts, at, allowing, outside, parties, to, review, its, effectiveness, and, utility, a, 2020, audit, by, the, u, s,

network, of, volunteer, contact, persons, regional, falun, dafa, associations, and, university, clubs, exist, in, approximately, 80, countries, li, hongzhi, s, teachings, are, principally, spread, through, the, internet, in, most, mid, to, large, sized, cities, falun, gong, practitioners, organize, regular, group, meditation, or, study, sessions, in, which, they, practice, falun, gong, exercises, and, read, li, hongzhi, s, writings, the, exercise, and, meditation, sessions, are, described, as, informal, groups, of, practitioners, who, gather, in, public, parks, usually, in, the, morning, for, one, to, two, hours, group, study, sessions, typically, take, place, in, the, evenings, in, private, residences, or, university, or, high, school, classrooms, and, are, described, by, david, ownby, as, the, closest, thing, to, a, regular, congregational, experience, that, falun, gong, offers, individuals, who, are, too, busy, isolated, or, who, simply, prefer, solitude, may, elect, to, practice, privately, when, there, are, expenses, to, be, covered, such, as, for, the, rental, of, facilities, for, large, scale, conferences, costs, are, borne, by, self, nominated, and, relatively, affluent, individual, members, of, the, community, in, 1993, the, beijing, based, falun, dafa, research, society, was, accepted, as, a, branch, of, the, state, run, china, qigong, research, society, cqrs, which, oversaw, the, administration, of, the, country, s, various, qigong, schools, and, sponsored, activities, and, seminars, as, per, the, requirements, of, the, cqrs, falun, gong, was, organized, into, a, nationwide, network, of, assistance, centers, main, stations, branches, guidance, stations, and, local, practice, sites, mirroring, the, structure, of, the, qigong, society, or, even, of, the, ccp, itself, falun, gong, assistants, were, self, selecting, volunteers, who, taught, the, exercises, organized, events, and, disseminated, new, writings, from, li, hongzhi, the, falun, dafa, research, society, provided, advice, to, students, on, meditation, techniques, translation, services, and, coordination, for, the, practice, nationwide, following, its, departure, from, the, cqrs, in, 1996, falun, gong, came, under, increased, scrutiny, from, authorities, and, responded, by, adopting, a, more, decentralized, and, loose, organizational, structure, in, 1997, the, falun, dafa, research, society, was, formally, dissolved, along, with, the, regional, main, stations, yet, practitioners, continued, to, organize, themselves, at, local, levels, being, connected, through, electronic, communications, interpersonal, networks, and, group, exercise, sites, both, falun, gong, sources, and, chinese, government, sources, claimed, that, there, were, some, 1, 900, guidance, stations, and, 28, 263, local, falun, gong, exercise, sites, nationwide, by, 1999, though, they, disagree, over, the, extent, of, vertical, coordination, among, these, organizational, units, in, response, to, the, persecution, that, began, in, 1999, falun, gong, was, driven, underground, the, organizational, structure, grew, yet, more, informal, within, china, and, the, internet, took, precedence, as, a, means, of, connecting, practitioners, following, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, in, 1999, chinese, authorities, sought, to, portray, falun, gong, as, a, hierarchical, and, well, funded, organization, james, tong, writes, that, it, was, in, the, government, s, interest, to, portray, falun, gong, as, highly, organized, in, order, to, justify, its, repression, of, the, group, the, more, organized, the, falun, gong, could, be, shown, to, be, then, the, more, justified, the, regime, s, repression, in, the, name, of, social, order, was, he, concluded, that, party, s, claims, lacked, both, internal, and, external, substantiating, evidence, and, that, despite, the, arrests, and, scrutiny, the, authorities, never, credibly, countered, falun, gong, rebuttals, falun, gong, operates, out, of, dragon, springs, a, 160, hectare, 400, acre, compound, located, in, deerpark, new, york, falun, gong, founder, and, leader, li, hongzhi,

and, temples, the, compound, is, registered, as, a, church, dragon, springs, buddhist, which, gives, it, tax, exemptions, and, greater, privacy, scholar, andrew, junker, noted, that, in, 2019, near, dragon, springs, in, middletown, was, an, office, for, the, falun, gong, media, extension, the, epoch, times, which, published, a, special, local, edition, the, compound, has, been, a, point, of, controversy, among, former, residents, according, to, nbc, news, our, former, compound, residents, and, former, falun, gong, practitioners, who, spoke, to, nbc, news, said, that, life, in, dragon, springs, is, tightly, controlled, by, li, that, internet, access, is, restricted, the, use, of, medicines, is, discouraged, and, arranged, relationships, are, common, two, former, residents, on, visas, said, they, were, offered, to, be, set, up, with, u, s, residents, at, the, compound, tiger, huang, a, former, dragon, springs, resident, who, was, on, a, united, states, student, visa, from, taiwan, said, she, was, set, up, on, three, dates, on, the, compound, and, she, believed, her, ability, to, stay, in, the, united, states, was, tied, to, the, arrangement, the, purpose, of, setting, up, the, dates, was, obvious, huang, said, her, now, husband, a, former, dragon, springs, resident, confirmed, the, account, huang, said, she, was, told, by, dragon, springs, officials, her, visa, had, expired, and, was, told, to, go, back, to, taiwan, after, months, of, dating, a, nonpractitioner, in, the, compound, she, later, learned, that, her, visa, had, not, expired, when, she, was, told, to, leave, the, country, acquired, by, falun, gong, in, 2000, the, site, is, closed, to, visitors, and, features, guarded, gates, has, been, a, point, of, contention, for, some, deer, park, residents, concerned, in, 2019, falun, gong, requested, to, expand, the, site, wishing, to, add, a, 920, seat, concert, hall, a, new, parking, garage, a, wastewater, treatment, plant, and, a, conversion, of, meditation, space, into, residential, space, large, enough, to, bring, the, total, residential, capacity, to, 500, people, these, plans, met, with, opposition, from, the, delaware, riverkeeper, network, regarding, the, wastewater, treatment, facility, and, the, elimination, of, local, wetlands, impacting, local, waterways, such, as, the, basher, kill, and, neversink, river, local, residents, opposed, the, expansion, because, it, would, increase, traffic, and, reduce, the, rural, character, of, the, area, falun, gong, adherents, living, in, the, area, have, claimed, that, they, have, experienced, discrimination, from, local, residents, after, visiting, in, 2019, junker, noted, that, the, secrecy, of, dragon, springs, was, obvious, and, a, source, of, tension, for, the, town, junker, adds, that, dragon, springs, s, website, says, its, restricted, access, is, for, security, reasons, and, that, the, site, claims, the, compound, contains, orphans, and, refugees, prior, to, july, 1999, official, chinese, government, estimates, placed, the, number, of, falun, gong, practitioners, at, 70, million, nationwide, rivalling, membership, in, the, ccp, by, the, time, of, the, persecution, on, 22, july, 1999, most, chinese, government, numbers, said, the, population, of, falun, gong, was, between, 2, and, 3, million, though, some, publications, maintained, an, estimate, of, 40, million, the, falun, gong, organization, estimated, in, the, same, period, that, the, total, number, of, practitioners, in, china, was, between, 70, and, 80, million, though, sociologist, david, a, palmer, notes, these, numbers, were, likely, highly, inflated, and, gives, a, more, reasonable, estimate, of, 10, million, other, sources, have, estimated, the, falun, gong, population, in, china, to, have, peaked, between, 10, and, 70, million, practitioners, the, number, of, falun, gong, practitioners, still, practicing, in, china, today, is, difficult, to, confirm, though, freedom, house, estimates, that, seven, to, 20, million, continue, to, practice, privately, demographic, surveys, conducted, in, china, in, 1998, found, a, population, that, was, mostly, female, and, elderly, of, 34,

college, or, graduate, level, several, times, higher, than, the, general, population, falun, gong, is, practiced, by, tens, and, possibly, hundreds, of, thousands, outside, china, with, the, largest, communities, found, in, taiwan, and, north, american, cities, with, large, chinese, populations, such, as, new, york, and, toronto, demographic, surveys, by, palmer, and, ownby, in, these, communities, found, that, 90, of, practitioners, are, ethnic, chinese, the, average, age, was, approximately, 40, among, survey, respondents, 56, were, female, and, 44, male, 80, were, married, the, surveys, found, the, respondents, to, be, highly, educated, 9, held, phds, 34, had, master, s, degrees, and, 24, had, a, bachelor, s, degree, as, of, 2008, the, most, commonly, reported, reasons, for, being, attracted, to, falun, gong, were, intellectual, content, cultivation, exercises, and, health, benefits, non, chinese, falun, gong, practitioners, tend, to, fit, the, profile, of, spiritual, seekers, people, who, had, tried, a, variety, of, qigong, yoga, or, religious, practices, before, finding, falun, gong, according, to, sociologist, richard, madsen, who, specializes, in, studying, modern, chinese, culture, chinese, scientists, with, doctorates, from, prestigious, american, universities, who, practice, falun, gong, claim, that, modern, physics, for, example, superstring, theory, and, biology, specifically, the, pineal, gland, s, function, provide, a, scientific, basis, for, their, beliefs, from, their, point, of, view, falun, dafa, is, knowledge, rather, than, religion, a,

and, was, authorized, to, teach, his, practice, nationwide, like, many, qigong, masters, at, the, time, li, toured, major, cities, in, china, from, 1992, to, 1994, to, teach, the, practice, he, was, granted, a, number, of, awards, by, prc, governmental, organizations, according, to, david, ownby, professor, of, history, and, director, of, the, center, for, east, asian, studies, at, the, universit, de, montr, al, li, became, an, instant, star, of, the, qigong, movement, and, falun, gong, was, embraced, by, the, government, as, an, effective, means, of, lowering, health, care, costs, promoting, chinese, culture, and, improving, public, morality, in, december, 1992, for, instance, li, and, several, falun, gong, students, participated, in, the, asian, health, expo, in, beijing, where, he, reportedly, received, the, most, praise, at, the, fair, and, achieved, very, good, therapeutic, results, according, to, the, fair, s, organizer, the, event, helped, cement, li, s,

benefits, it, rapidly, spread, via, word, of, mouth, attracting, a, wide, range, of, practitioners, from, all, walks, of, life, including, numerous, members, of, the, chinese, communist, party, from, 1992, to, 1994, li, did, charge, fees, for, the, seminars, he, was, giving, across, china, though, the, fees, were, considerably, lower, than, those, of, competing, qigong, practices, and, the, local, qigong, associations, received, a, substantial, share, li, justified, the, fees, as, being, necessary, to, cover, travel, costs, and, other, expenses, and, on, some, occasions, he, donated, the, money, earned, to, charitable, causes, in, 1994, li, ceased, charging, fees, altogether, thereafter, stipulating, that, falun, gong, must, always, be, taught, for, free, and, its, teachings, made, available, without, charge, including, online, although, some, observers, believe, li, continued, to, earn, substantial, income, through, the, sale, of, falun, gong, books, others, dispute, this,

chinese, authorities, began, looking, to, falun, gong, to, solidify, its, organizational, structure, and, ties, to, the, party, state, li, was, approached, by, the, chinese, national, sports, committee, ministry, of, public, health, and, china, qigong, science, research, association, cqrs, to, jointly, establish, a, falun, gong, association, li, declined, the, offer, the, same, year, the, cqrs, issued, a, new, regulation, mandating, that, all, qigong, denominations, establish, a, chinese, communist, party, branch, li, again, refused, tensions, continued, to, mount, between, li, and, the, cqrs, in, 1996, in, the, face, of, falun, gong, s, rise, in, popularity, a, large, part, of, which, was, attributed, to, its, low, cost, competing, qigong, masters, accused, li, of, undercutting, them, according, to, schechter, the, qigong, society, under, which, li, and, other, qigong, masters, belonged, asked, li, to, hike, his, tuition, but, li, emphasized, the, need, for, the, teachings, to, be, free, of, charge, in, march, 1996, falun, gong, withdrew, from, the, cqrs, in, response, to, mounting, disagreements, after, which, time, it, operated, outside, the, official, sanction, of, the, state, falun, gong, representatives, attempted, to, register, with, other, government, entities, but, were, rebuffed, li, and, falun, gong, were, then, outside, the, circuit, of, personal, relations, and, financial, exchanges, through, which, masters, and, their, qigong, organizations, could, find, a, place, within, the, state, system, and, also, the, protections, this, afforded, falun, gong, s, departure, from, the, state, run, cqrs, corresponded, to, a, wider, shift, in, the, government, s, attitudes, towards, qigong, practices, as, qigong, s, detractors, in, government, grew, more, influential, authorities, began, attempting, to, rein, in, the, growth, and, influence, of, these, groups, some, of, which, had, amassed, tens, of, millions, of, followers, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, state, run, media, began, publishing, articles, critical, of, qigong, falun, gong, was, initially, shielded, from, the, mounting, criticism, but, following, its, withdrawal, from, the, cqrs, in, march, 1996, it, lost, this, protection, on, 17, june, 1996, the, guangming, daily, an, influential, state, run, newspaper, published, a, polemic, against, falun, gong, in, which, its, central, text, zhuan, falun, was, described, as, an, example, of, feudal, superstition, the, author, wrote, that, the, history, of, humanity, is, a, struggle, between, science, and, superstition, and, called, on, chinese, publishers, not, to, print, pseudo, scientific, books, of, the, swindlers, the, article, was, followed, by, at, least, twenty, more, in, newspapers, nationwide, soon, after, on, 24, july, the, central, propaganda, department, banned, all, publication, of, falun, gong, books, though, the, ban, was, not, consistently, enforced, the, state, administered, buddhist, association, of, china, also, began, issuing, criticisms, of, falun, gong, urging, lay, buddhists, not, to, take, up, the, practice, the, events, were, an, important, challenge, to, falun, gong, and, one, that, practitioners, did, not, take, lightly, thousands, of, falun, gong, followers, wrote, to, guangming, daily, and, to, the, cqrs, to, complain, against, the, measures, claiming, that, they, violated, hu, yaobang, s, 1982, triple, no, directive, which, prohibited, the, media, from, either, encouraging, or, criticizing, qigong, practices, in, other, instances, falun, gong, practitioners, staged, peaceful, demonstrations, outside, media, or, local, government, offices, to, request, retractions, of, perceived, unfair, coverage, the, polemics, against, falun, gong, were, part, of, a, larger, movement, opposing, qigong, organizations, in, the, state, run, media, although, falun, gong, was, not, the, only, target, of, the, media, criticism, nor, the, only, group, to, protest, theirs, was, the, most, mobilized, and, steadfast, response, many, of, falun, gong, s, protests, against, negative, media, portrayals, were, successful, resulting, in, the, retraction, of, several, newspaper, stories, critical, of, the, practice, this, contributed, to, practitioners, belief, that, the, media, claims, against, them, were, false, or, exaggerated, and, that, their, stance, was, justified, in, june, 1998, he, zuoxiu, an, outspoken, critic, of, qigong, and, a, fierce, defender, of, marxism, appeared, on, a, talk, show, on, beijing, television, and, openly, disparaged, qigong, groups, making,

outlets, in, 1997, the, ministry, of, public, security, launched, an, investigation, into, whether, falun, gong, should, be, deemed, xie, jiao, heretical, teaching, the, report, concluded, that, no, evidence, has, appeared, thus, far, the, following, year, however, on, 21, july, 1998, the, ministry, of, public, security, issued, document, no, 555, notice, of, the, investigation, of, falun, gong, the, document, asserted, that, falun, gong, is, a, heretical, teaching, and, mandated, that, another, investigation, be, launched, to, seek, evidence, in, support, of, the, conclusion, falun, gong, practitioners, reported, having, phone, lines, tapped, homes, ransacked, and, raided, and, falun, gong, exercise, sites, disrupted, by, public, security, agents, in, this, time, period, even, as, criticism, of, qigong, and, falun, gong, mounted, in, some, circles, the, practice, maintained, a, number, of, high, profile, supporters, in, the, government, in, 1998, qiao, shi, the, recently, retired, chairman, of, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, people, s, congress, initiated, his, own, investigation, into, falun, gong, after, months, of, investigations, his, group, concluded, that, falun, gong, has, hundreds, of, benefits, for, the, chinese, people, and, china, and, does, not, have, one, single, bad, effect, in, may, of, the, same, year, china, s, national, sports, commission, launched, its, own, survey, of, falun, gong, based, on, interviews, with, over, 12, 000, falun, gong, practitioners, in, guangdong, province, they, stated, that, they, were,

the, chinese, nationalist, discourse, evocation, of, a, different, vision, of, chinese, tradition, and, its, contemporary, values, are, now, so, threatening, to, the, state, and, the, party, because,

and, transform, their, thoughts, terms, were, also, arbitrarily, extended, by, police, while, some, practitioners, had, ambiguous, charges, levied, against, them, such, as, disrupting, social, order, endangering, national, security, or, subverting, the, socialist, system, according, to, bejesky, the, majority, of, long, term, falun, gong, detainees, are, processed, administratively, through, this,

investigative, journalist, ethan, gutmann, estimated, 65, 000, falun, gong, were, killed, for, their, organs, from, 2000, to, 2008, based, on, extensive, interviews, while, researchers, david, kilgour, and, david, matas, reported, the, source, of, 41, 500, transplants, for, the, six, year, period, 2000, to, 2005, is, unexplained, chinese, authorities, do, not, publish, statistics, on, falun, gong, practitioners, killed, amidst, the, crackdown, in, individual, cases, however, authorities, have, denied, that, deaths, in, custody, were, due, to, torture, in, 2006, allegations, emerged, that, a, large, number, of, falun, gong, practitioners, had, been, killed, to, supply, china, s, organ, transplant, industry, these, allegations, prompted, an, investigation, by, former, canadian, secretary, of, state, david, kilgour, and, human, rights, lawyer, david, matas, the, kilgour, matas, report, was, published, in, july, 2006, and, concluded, that, the, government, of, china, and, its, agencies, in, numerous, parts, of, the, country, in, particular, hospitals, but, also, detention, centers, and, people, s, courts, since, 1999, have, put, to, death, a, large, but, unknown, number, of, falun, gong, prisoners, of, conscience, the, report, which, was, based, mainly, on, circumstantial, evidence, called, attention, to, the, extremely, short, wait, times, for, organs, in, china, one, to, two, weeks, for, a, liver, compared, with, 32, 5, months, in, canada, implying, it, was, indicative, of, organs, being, procured, on, demand, it, also, tracked, a, significant, increase, in, the, number, of, annual, organ, transplants, in, china, beginning, in, 1999, corresponding, with, the, onset, of, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, despite, very, low, levels, of, voluntary, organ, donation, china, performs, the, second, highest, number, of, transplants, per, year, kilgour, and, matas, also, presented, self, accusatory, material, from, chinese, transplant, center, web, sites, advertising, the, immediate, availability, of, organs, from, living, donors, and, transcripts, of, interviews, in, which, hospitals, told, prospective, transplant, recipients, that, they, could, obtain, falun, gong, organs, in, may, 2008, two, united, nations, special, rapporteurs, reiterated, requests, for, the, chinese, authorities, to, respond, to, the, allegations, and, to, explain, a, source, for, the, organs, that, would, account, for, the, sudden, increase, in, organ, transplants, in, china, since, 2000, chinese, officials, have, responded, by, denying, the, organ, harvesting, allegations, and, insisting, that, china, abides, by, world, health, organization, principles, that, prohibit, the, sale, of, human, organs, without, written, consent, from, donors, responding, to, a, u, s, house, of, representatives, resolution, calling, for, an, end, to, abusing, transplant, practices, against, religious, and, ethnic, minorities, a, chinese, embassy, spokesperson, said, the, so, called, organ, harvesting, from, death, row, prisoners, is, totally, a, lie, fabricated, by, falun, gong, in, august, 2009, manfred, nowak, the, united, nations, special, rapporteur, on, torture, said, the, chinese, government, has, yet, to, come, clean, and, be, transparent, it, remains, to, be, seen, how, it, could, be, possible, that, organ, transplant, surgeries, in, chinese, hospitals, have, risen, massively, since, 1999, while, there, are, never, that, many, voluntary, donors, available, in, 2014, investigative, journalist, ethan, gutmann, published, the,

medical, professionals, with, knowledge, of, china, s, transplant, practices, he, reported, that, organ, harvesting, from, political, prisoners, likely, began, in, xinjiang, province, in, the, 1990s, and, then, spread, nationwide, gutmann, estimates, that, some, 64, 000, falun, gong, prisoners, may, have, been, killed, for, their, organs, between, the, years, 2000, and, 2008, in, a, 2016, report, david, kilgour, found, that, he, had, underestimated, in, the, new, report, he, found, that, the, government, s, official, estimates, for, the, volume, of, organs, harvested, since, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, began, to, be, 150, 000, to, 200, 000, media, outlets, have, extrapolated, from, this, study, a, death, toll, of, 1, 5, million, ethan, gutmann, estimated, from, this, update, that, 60, 000, to, 110, 000, organs, are, harvested, in, china, annually, observing, that, it, is, paraphrasing, difficult, but, plausible, to, harvest, 3, organs, from, a, single, body, and, also, calls, the, harvest, a, new, form, of, genocide, using, the, most, respected, members, of, society, in, june, 2019, the, china, tribunal, an, independent, tribunal, set, up, by, the, international, coalition, to, end, transplant, abuse, in, china, concluded, that, detainees, including, imprisoned, followers, of, the, falun, gong, movement, are, still, being, killed, for, organ, harvesting, the, tribunal, chaired, by, sir, geoffrey, nice, qc, said, it, was, certain, that, falun, gong, as, a, source, probably, the, principal, source, of, organs, for, forced, organ, harvesting, in, june, 2021, the, special, procedures, of, the, united, nations, human, rights, council, voiced, concerns, over, having, received, credible, information, that, detainees, from, ethnic, linguistic, or, religious, minorities, may, be, forcibly, subjected, to, blood, tests, and, organ, examinations, such, as, ultrasound, and, x, rays, without, their, informed, consent, while, other, prisoners, are, not, required, to, undergo, such, examinations, the, press, release, stated, that, un, s, human, rights, experts, were, extremely, alarmed, by, reports, of, alleged, organ, harvesting, targeting, minorities, including, falun, gong, practitioners, uyghurs, tibetans, muslims, and, christians, in, detention, in, china, the, chinese, government, s, campaign, against, falun, gong, was, driven, by, large, scale, propaganda, through, television, newspapers, radio, and, internet, the, propaganda, campaign, focused, on, allegations, that, falun, gong, jeopardized, social, stability, was, deceiving, and, dangerous, was, anti, science, and, threatened, progress, and, argued, that, falun, gong, s, moral, philosophy, was, incompatible, with, a, marxist, social, ethic, china, scholars, daniel, wright, and, joseph, fewsmith, stated, that, for, several, months, after, falun, gong, was, outlawed, china, central, television, s, evening, news, contained, little, but, anti, falun, gong, rhetoric, the, government, operation, was, a, study, in, all, out, demonization, they, wrote, falun, gong, was, compared, to, a, rat, crossing, the, street, that, everyone, shouts, out, to, squash, by, beijing, daily, other, officials, said, it, would, be, a, long, term, complex, and, serious, struggle, to, eradicate, falun, gong, state, propaganda, initially, used, the, appeal, of, scientific, rationalism, to, argue, that, falun, gong, s, worldview, was, in, complete, opposition, to, science, and, communism, for, example, the, people, s, daily, asserted, on, 27, july, 1999, that, the, fight, against, falun, gong, was, a, struggle, between, theism, and, atheism, superstition, and, science, idealism, and, materialism, other, editorials, declared, that, falun, gong, s, idealism, and, theism, are, absolutely, contradictory, to, the, fundamental, theories, and, principles, of, marxism, and, that, the, truth, kindness, and, forbearance, principle, preached, by, has, nothing, in, common, with, the, socialist, ethical, and, cultural, progress, we, are, striving, to, achieve, suppressing, falun, gong, was, presented, as, a, necessary, step, to, maintaining, the, vanguard, role, of, the, ccp, in, chinese, society, despite, party, efforts, initial, charges, leveled, against, falun, gong, failed, to, elicit, widespread, popular, support, for, the, persecution, of, the, group, in, the, months, following, july, 1999, the, rhetoric, in, the, state, run, press, escalated, to, include, charges, that, falun, gong, was, colluding, with, foreign, anti, china, forces, in, october, 1999, three, months, after, the, persecution, began, the, people, s, daily, newspaper, claimed, falun, gong, as, a, xiejiao, a, direct, translation, of, that, term, is, heretical, teaching, but, during, the, anti, falun, gong, propaganda, campaign, was, rendered, as, evil, cult, in, english, according, to, a, washington, post, report, it, was, jiang, zemin, who, issued, the, order, to, label, falun, gong, a, cult, in, mainland, china, the, term, xiejiao, has, been, used, to, target, religious, organizations, that, do, not, submit, to, communist, party, authority, ian, johnson, argued, that, applying, the, cult, label, to, falun, gong, effectively, cloaked, the, government, s, crackdown, with, the, legitimacy, of, the, west, s, anticult, movement, he, wrote, that, falun, gong, does, not, satisfy, common, definitions, of, a, cult, its, members, marry, outside, the, group, have, outside, friends, hold, normal, jobs, do, not, live, isolated, from, society, do, not, believe, that, the, world, s, end, is, imminent, and, do, not, give, significant, amounts, of, money, to, the, organisation, it, does, not, advocate, violence, and, is, at, heart, an, apolitical, inward, oriented, discipline, one, aimed, at, cleansing, oneself, spiritually, and, improving, one, s, health, 224, david, ownby, similarly, wrote, that, the, entire, issue, of, the, supposed, cultic, nature, of, falun, gong, was, a, red, herring, from, the, beginning, cleverly, exploited, by, the, chinese, state, to, blunt, the, appeal, of, falun, gong, according, to, john, powers, and, meg, y, m, lee, because, the, falun, gong, was, categorized, in, the, popular, perception, as, an, apolitical, qigong, exercise, club, it, was, not, seen, as, a, threat, to, the, government, the, most, critical, strategy, in, the, falun, gong, suppression, campaign, therefore, was, to, convince, people, to, reclassify, the, falun, gong, into, a, number, of, negatively, charged, religious, labels, like, evil, cult, sect, or, superstition, the, group, s, silent, protests, were, reclassified, as, creating, social, disturbances, in, this, process, of, relabelling, the, government, was, attempting, to, tap, into, a, deep, reservoir, of, negative, feelings, related, to, the, historical, role, of, quasi, religious, cults, as, a, destabilising, force, in, chinese, political, history, a, turning, point, in, the, propaganda, campaign, came, on, the, eve, of, chinese, new, year, on, 23, january, 2001, when, five, people, attempted, to, set, themselves, ablaze, on, tiananmen, square, the, official, chinese, press, agency, xinhua, news, agency, and, other, state, media, asserted, that, the, self, immolators, were, practitioners, though, the, falun, dafa, information, center, disputed, this, on, the, grounds, that, the, movement, s, teachings, explicitly, forbid, suicide, and, killing, 224, further, alleging, that, the, event, was, a, cruel, but, clever, piece, of, stunt, work, the, incident, received, international, news, coverage, and, video, footage, of, the, burnings, were, broadcast, later, inside, china, by, china, central, television, cctv, the, broadcasts, showed, images, of, a, 12, year, old, girl, liu, siying, burning, and, interviews, with, the, other, participants, in, which, they, stated, a, belief, that, self, immolation, would, lead, them, to, paradise, but, one, of, the, cnn, producers, on, the, scene, did, not, even, see, a, child, there, falun, gong, sources, and, other, commentators, pointed, out, that, the, main, participants, account, of, the, incident, and, other, aspects, of, the, participants, behavior, were, inconsistent, with, falun, gong, s, teachings, media, channel, and, the, international, education, development, ied, agree, that, the, supposed, self, immolation, incident, was, staged, by, ccp, to, prove, that, falun, gong, brainwashes, its, followers, to, commit, suicide, and, has, therefore, to, be, banned, as, a, threat, to, the, nation, ied, s, statement, at, the, 53rd, un, session, describes, china, s, violent, assault, on, falun, gong, practitioners, as, state, terrorism, and, that, the, self, immolation, was, staged, by, the, government, washington, post, journalist, phillip, pan, wrote, that, the, two, self, immolators, who, died, were, not, actually, falun, gong, practitioners, on, march, 21, 2001, liu, siying, suddenly, died, after, appearing, very, lively, and, being, deemed, ready, to, leave, the, hospital, to, go, home, time, reported, that, prior, to, the, self, immolation, incident, many, chinese, had, felt, that, falun, gong, posed, no, real, threat, and, that, the, state, s, crackdown, had, gone, too, far, after, the, event, however, the, mainland, chinese, media, campaign, against, falun, gong, gained, significant, traction, as, public, sympathy, for, falun, gong, declined, the, government, began, sanctioning, systematic, use, of, violence, against, the, group, in, february, 2001, the, month, following, the, tiananmen, square, self, immolation, incident, jiang, zemin, convened, a, rare, central, work, conference, to, stress, the, importance, of, continuity, in, the, anti, falun, gong, campaign, and, unite, senior, party, officials, behind, the, effort, under, jiang, s, leadership, the, crackdown, on, falun, gong, became, part, of, the, chinese, political, ethos, of, upholding, stability, much, the, same, rhetoric, employed, by, the, party, during, 1989, tiananmen, square, protests, and, massacre, jiang, s, message, was, echoed, at, the, 2001, national, people, s, congress, where, the, falun, gong, s, eradication, was, tied, to, china, s, economic, progress, though, less, prominent, on, the, national, agenda, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, has, carried, on, after, jiang, was, retired, successive, high, level, strike, hard, campaigns, against, falun, gong, were, initiated, in, both, 2008, and, 2009, in, 2010, a, three, year, campaign, was, launched, to, renew, attempts, at, the, coercive, transformation, of, falun, gong, practitioners, anti, falun, gong, propaganda, efforts, have, also, permeated, the, chinese, education, system, following, jiang, zemin, s, 1999, ban, of, falun, gong, then, minister, of, education, chen, zhili, launched, an, active, campaign, to, promote, the, party, s, line, on, falun, gong, within, all, levels, of, academic, institutions, including, graduate, schools, universities, and, colleges, middle, schools, primary, schools, and, kindergartens, her, efforts, included, a, cultural, revolution, like, pledge, in, chinese, schools, that, required, faculty, members, staff, and, students, to, publicly, denounce, falun, gong, teachers, who, did, not, comply, with, chen, s, program, were, dismissed, or, detained, uncooperative, students, were, refused, academic, advancement, expelled, from, school, or, sent, to, transformation, camps, to, alter, their, thinking, chen, also, worked, to, spread, the, anti, falun, gong, academic, propaganda, movement, overseas, using, domestic, educational, funding, to, donate, aid, to, foreign, institutions, encouraging, them, to, oppose, falun, gong, falun, gong, s, response, to, the, persecution, in, china, began, in, july, 1999, with, appeals, to, local, provincial, and, central, petitioning, offices, in, beijing, it, soon, progressed, to, larger, demonstrations, with, hundreds, of, falun, gong, practitioners, traveling, daily, to, tiananmen, square, to, perform, falun, gong, exercises, or, raise, banners, in, defense, of, the, practice, these, demonstrations, were, invariably, broken, up, by, security, forces, and, the, practitioners, involved, were, arrested, sometimes, violently, and, detained, by, 25, april, 2000, a, total, of, more, than, 30, 000, practitioners, had, been, arrested, on, the, square, seven, hundred, falun, gong, followers, were, arrested, during, a, demonstration, in, the, square, on, 1, january, 2001, public, protests, continued, well, into, 2001, writing, for, the, wall, street, journal, ian, johnson, wrote, that, falun, gong, faithful, have, mustered, what, is, arguably, the, most, sustained, challenge, to, authority, in, 50, years, of, communist, rule, by, late, 2001, demonstrations, in, tiananmen, square, had, become, less, frequent, and, the, practice, was, driven, deeper, underground, as, public, protest, fell, out, of, favor, practitioners, established, underground, material, sites, which, would, produce, literature, and, dvds, to, counter, the, portrayal, of, falun, gong, in, the, official, media, practitioners, then, distribute, these, materials, often, door, to, door, falun, gong, sources, estimated, in, 2009, that, over, 200, 000, such, sites, exist, across, china, today, the, production, possession, or, distribution, of, these, materials, is, frequently, grounds, for, security, agents, to, incarcerate, or, sentence, falun, gong, practitioners, in, 2002, falun, gong, activists, in, china, tapped, into, television, broadcasts, replacing, regular, state, run, programming, with, their, own, content, one, of, the, more, notable, instances, occurred, in, march, 2002, when, falun, gong, practitioners, in, changchun, intercepted, eight, cable, television, networks, in, jilin, province, and, for, nearly, an, hour, televised, a, program, titled, self, immolation, or, a, staged, act, all, six, of, the, falun, gong, practitioners, involved, were, captured, over, the, next, few, months, two, were, killed, immediately, while, the, other, four, were, all, dead, by, 2010, as, a, result, of, injuries, sustained, while, imprisoned, outside, china, falun, gong, practitioners, established, international, media, organizations, to, gain, wider, exposure, for, their, cause, and, challenge, narratives, of, the, chinese, state, run, media, these, include, the, epoch, times, newspaper, new, tang, dynasty, television, and, sound, of, hope, radio, station, according, to, zhao, through, the, epoch, times, it, can, be, discerned, how, falun, gong, is, building, a, de, facto, media, alliance, with, china, s, democracy, movements, in, exile, as, demonstrated, by, its, frequent, printing, of, articles, by, prominent, overseas, chinese, critics, of, the, prc, government, in, 2004, the, epoch, times, published, a, collection, of, nine, editorials, that, presented, a, critical, history, of, the, chinese, communist, party, this, catalyzed, the, tuidang, movement, which, encourages, chinese, citizens, to, renounce, their, affiliations, to, the, chinese, communist, party, including, ex, post, facto, renunciations, of, the, communist, youth, league, and, young, pioneers, the, epoch, times, claims, that, tens, of, millions, have, renounced, the, chinese, communist, party, as, part, of, the, movement, though, these, numbers, have, not, been, independently, verified, in, 2006, falun, gong, practitioners, in, the, united, states, formed, shen, yun, performing, arts, a, dance, and, music, company, that, tours, internationally, falun, gong, software, developers, in, the, united, states, are, also, responsible, for, the, creation, of, several, popular, censorship, circumvention, tools, employed, by, internet, users, in, china, falun, gong, practitioners, outside, china, have, filed, dozens, of, lawsuits, against, jiang, zemin, luo, gan, bo, xilai, and, other, chinese, officials, alleging, genocide, and, crimes, against, humanity, according, to, international, advocates, for, justice, falun, gong, has, filed, the, largest, number, of, human, rights, lawsuits, in, the, 21st, century, and, the, charges, are, among, the, most, severe, international, crimes, defined, by, international, criminal, laws, as, of, 2006, 54, civil, and, criminal, lawsuits, were, under, way, in, 33, countries, in, many, instances, courts, have, refused, to, adjudicate, the, cases, on, the, grounds, of, sovereign, immunity, in, late, 2009, however, separate, courts, in, spain, and, argentina, indicted, jiang, zemin, and, luo, gan, on, charges, of, crimes, of, humanity, and, genocide, and, asked, for, their, arrest, the, ruling, is, acknowledged, to, be, largely, symbolic, and, unlikely, to, be, carried, out, the, court, in, spain, also, indicted, bo, xilai, jia, qinglin, and, wu, guanzheng, falun, gong, practitioners, and, their, supporters, also, filed, a, lawsuit, in, may, 2011, against, the, technology, company, cisco, systems, alleging, that, the, company, helped, design, and, implement, a, surveillance, system, for, the, chinese, government, to, suppress, falun, gong, cisco, denied, customizing, their, technology, for, this, purpose, li, hongzhi, began, teaching, falun, gong, internationally, in, march, 1995, his, first, stop, was, in, paris, where, at, the, invitation, of, the, chinese, ambassador, he, held, a, lecture, seminar, at, the, prc, embassy, this, was, followed, by, lectures, in, sweden, in, may, 1995, between, 1995, and, 1999, li, gave, lectures, in, the, united, states, canada, australia, new, zealand, germany, switzerland, and, singapore, falun, gong, s, growth, outside, china, largely, corresponded, to, the, migration, of, students, from, mainland, china, to, the, west, in, the, early, to, mid, 1990s, falun, gong, associations, and, clubs, began, appearing, in, europe, north, america, and, australia, with, activities, centered, mainly, on, university, campuses, translations, of, falun, gong, teachings, began, appearing, in, the, late, 1990s, as, the, practice, began, proliferating, outside, china, li, hongzhi, was, beginning, to, receive, recognition, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, in, the, western, world, in, may, 1999, li, was, welcomed, to, toronto, with, greetings, from, the, city, s, mayor, and, the, provincial, lieutenant, governor, and, in, the, two, months, that, followed, also, received, recognition, from, the, cities, of, chicago, and, san, jose, although, the, practice, was, beginning, to, attract, an, overseas, constituency, in, the, 1990s, it, remained, relatively, unknown, outside, china, until, the, spring, of, 1999, when, tensions, between, falun, gong, and, the, ccp, became, a, subject, of, international, media, coverage, with, the, increased, attention, the, practice, gained, a, greater, following, outside, china, following, the, launch, of, the, ccp, s, suppression, campaign, against, falun, gong, the, overseas, presence, became, vital, to, the, practice, s, resistance, in, china, and, its, continued, survival, falun, gong, practitioners, overseas, have, responded, to, the, persecution, in, china, through, regular, demonstrations, parades, and, through, the, creation, of, media, outlets, performing, arts, companies, and, censorship, circumvention, software, mainly, intended, to, reach, mainland, chinese, audiences, in, its, study, of, transnational, repression, committed, by, governments, freedom, house, has, reported, that, practitioners, of, falun, gong, have, been, targeted, by, the, chinese, government, s, transnational, repression, campaign, since, 1999, numerous, western, governments, and, human, rights, organizations, have, expressed, condemnation, of, the, chinese, government, s, suppression, of, falun, gong, since, 1999, members, of, the, united, states, congress, have, made, public, pronouncements, and, introduced, several, resolutions, in, support, of, falun, gong, in, 2010, u, s, house, of, representatives, resolution, 605, called, for, an, immediate, end, to, the, campaign, to, persecute, intimidate, imprison, and, torture, falun, gong, practitioners, condemned, the, chinese, authorities, efforts, to, distribute, false, propaganda, about, the, practice, worldwide, and, expressed, sympathy, to, persecuted, falun, gong, practitioners, and, their, families, adam, frank, writes, that, in, reporting, on, the, falun, gong, the, western, tradition, of, casting, the, chinese, as, exotic, took, dominance, and, that, while, the, facts, were, generally, correct, in, western, media, coverage, the, normalcy, that, millions, of, chinese, practitioners, associated, with, the, practice, had, all, but, disappeared, david, ownby, wrote, that, alongside, these, tactics, the, cult, label, applied, to, falun, gong, by, the, chinese, authorities, never, entirely, went, away, in, the, minds, of, some, westerners, and, the, stigma, still, plays, a, role, in, wary, public, perceptions, of, falun, gong, to, counter, the, support, of, falun, gong, in, the, west, the, chinese, government, expanded, their, efforts, against, the, group, internationally, this, included, visits, to, newspaper, officers, by, diplomats, to, extol, the, virtues, of, communist, china, and, the, evils, of, falun, gong, linking, support, for, falun, gong, with, jeopardizing, trade, relations, and, sending, letters, to, local, politicians, telling, them, to, withdraw, support, for, the, practice, according, to, perry, link, pressure, on, western, institutions, also, takes, more, subtle, forms, including, academic, self, censorship, whereby, research, on, falun, gong, could, result, in, a, denial, of, visa, for, fieldwork, in, china, or, exclusion, and, discrimination, from, business, and, community, groups, who, have, connections, with, china, and, fear, angering, chinese, government, although, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, has, drawn, considerable, condemnation, outside, china, some, observers, assert, that, falun, gong, has, failed, to, attract, the, level, of, sympathy, and, sustained, attention, afforded, to, other, chinese, dissident, groups, katrina, lantos, swett, vice, chair, of, the, united, states, commission, on, international, religious, freedom, has, said, most, americans, are, aware, of, the, suppression, of, tibetan, buddhists, and, unregistered, christian, groups, or, pro, democracy, and, free, speech, advocates, such, as, liu, xiaobo, and, ai, weiwei, and, yet, know, little, to, nothing, about, china, s, assault, on, the, falun, gong, ethan, gutmann, a, journalist, reporting, on, china, since, the, early, 1990s, has, attempted, to, explain, this, apparent, dearth, of, public, sympathy, for, falun, gong, as, stemming, in, part, from, the, group, s, shortcomings, in, public, relations, unlike, the, democracy, activists, or, tibetans, who, have, found, a, comfortable, place, in, western, perceptions, falun, gong, marched, to, a, distinctly, chinese, drum, gutmann, writes, moreover, practitioners, attempts, at, getting, their, message, across, carried, some, of, the, uncouthness, of, communist, party, culture, including, a, perception, that, practitioners, tended, to, exaggerate, create, torture, tableaux, straight, out, of, a, cultural, revolution, opera, or, spout, slogans, rather, than, facts, this, is, coupled, with, a, general, doubtfulness, in, the, west, of, persecuted, refugees, gutmann, also, says, that, media, organizations, and, human, rights, groups, also, self, censor, on, the, topic, given, the, prc, governments, vehement, attitude, toward, the, practice, and, the, potential, repercussions, that, may, follow, for, making, overt, representations, on, falun, gong, s, behalf, richard, madsen, writes, that, falun, gong, lacks, robust, backing, from, the, american, constituencies, that, usually, support, religious, freedom, for, instance, falun, gong, s, conservative, moral, beliefs, have, alienated, some, liberal, constituencies, in, the, west, e, g, its, teachings, against, promiscuity, and, homosexual, behavior, 211, he, also, states, that, christian, conservatives, do, not, support, falun, gong, while, they, do, chinese, christians, madsen, charges, that, the, american, political, center, does, not, want, to, push, the, human, rights, issue, so, hard, that, it, would, disrupt, commercial, and, political, relations, with, china, thus, falun, gong, practitioners, have, largely, had, to, rely, on, their, own, resources, in, responding, to, suppression, in, august, 2007, the, newly, reestablished, rabbinic, sanhedrin, deliberated, persecution, of, the, movement, by, the, chinese, government, at, the, request, of, falun, gong
