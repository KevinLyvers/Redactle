upstate, new, york, a, phase, of, the, second, great, awakening, william, miller, predicted, on, the, basis, of, daniel, 8, 14, 16, and, the, day, year, principle, that, jesus, christ, would, return, to, earth, between, the, spring, of, 1843, and, the, spring, of, 1844, in, the, summer, of, 1844, millerites, came, to, believe, that, jesus, would, return, on, october, 22, 1844, understood, to, be, the, biblical, day, of, atonement, for, that, year, miller, s, failed, prediction, became, known, as, the, great, disappointment, hiram, edson, and, other, millerites, came, to, believe, that, miller, s, calculations, were, correct, but, that, his, interpretation, of, daniel, 8, 14, was, flawed, as, he, assumed, christ, would, come, to, cleanse, the, world, these, adventists, came, to, the, conviction, that, daniel, 8, 14, foretold, christ, s, entrance, into, the, most, holy, place, of, the, heavenly, sanctuary, rather, than, his, second, coming, over, the, next, few, decades, this, understanding, of, a, sanctuary, in, heaven, developed, into, the, doctrine, of, the, investigative, judgment, an, eschatological, process, that, commenced, in, 1844, in, which, every, person, would, be, judged, to, verify, their, eligibility, for, salvation, and, god, s, justice, will, be, confirmed, before, the, universe, this, group, of, adventists, continued, to, believe, that, christ, s, second, coming, would, continue, to, be, imminent, however, they, resisted, setting, further, dates, for, the, event, citing, revelation, 10, 6, that, there, should, be, time, no, longer, as, the, early, adventist, movement, consolidated, its, beliefs, the, question, of, the, biblical, day, of, rest, and, worship, was, raised, the, foremost, proponent, of, sabbath, keeping, among, early, adventists, was, joseph, bates, bates, was, introduced, to, the, sabbath, doctrine, through, a, tract, written, by, millerite, preacher, thomas, m, preble, who, in, turn, had, been, influenced, by, rachel, oakes, preston, a, young, seventh, day, baptist, this, message, was, gradually, accepted, and, formed, the, topic, of, the, first, edition, of, the, church, publication, the, present, truth, which, appeared, in, july, 1849, for, about, 20, years, the, adventist, movement, consisted, of, a, small, loosely, knit, group, of, people, who, came, from, many, churches, and, whose, primary, means, of, connection, and, interaction, was, through, james, white, s, periodical, the, advent, review, and, sabbath, herald, they, embraced, the, doctrines, of, the, sabbath, the, heavenly, sanctuary, interpretation, of, daniel, 8, 14, conditional, immortality, and, the, expectation, of, christ, s, premillennial, return, among, its, most, prominent, figures, were, joseph, bates, james, white, and, ellen, g, white, ellen, white, came, to, occupy, a, particularly, central, role, her, many, visions, and, spiritual, leadership, convinced, her, fellow, adventists, that, she, possessed,

formed, its, core, beliefs, and, doctrines, especially, as, a, number, of, the, early, adventist, leaders, came, from, churches, that, held, to, some, form, of, arianism, ellen, g, white, was, not, one, of, them, this, along, with, some, of, the, movement, s, other, theological, views, led, conservative, evangelical, protestants, to, regard, it, as, a, cult, according, to, adventist, scholars, the, teachings, and, writings, of, white, ultimately, proved, influential, in, shifting, the, church, from, largely, semi, arian, roots, towards, trinitarianism, adventists, for, the, most, part, credit, her, with, bringing, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, into, a, more, comprehensive, awareness, of, the, godhead, during, the, 1890s, the, adventist, church, adopted, trinitarian, theology, early, in, the, 20th, century, and, began, to, dialogue, with, other, protestant, groups, toward, the, middle, of, the, century, eventually, gaining, wide, recognition, as, a, protestant, church, christianity, today, recognized, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, as, the, fifth, largest, christian, communion, worldwide, in, its, january, 22, 2015, issue, although, her, husband, claimed, that, her, visions, did, not, support, the, trinitarian, creed, her, writings, reveal, a, growing, awareness, on, the, mystery, of, the, godhead, after, continued, bible, study, and, after, a, decades, long, debate, the, denomination, eventually, concluded, that, scripture, explicitly, teaches, the, belief, in, the, existence, of, a, triune, god, and, it, affirmed, that, biblical, view, in, the, non, credal, 28, fundamental, beliefs, however, mainstream, scholars, are, still, not, convinced, that, ellen, white, was, a, nicene, trinitarian, in, her, writing, she, mentions, a, ceremony, in, heaven, where, jesus, was, recognized, in, front, of, the, heavenly, host, to, be, equal, with, the, father, which, satan, disapproved, of, as, explained, in, her, book, spirit, of,

lives, this, means, that, our, amusement, and, entertainment, should, meet, the, highest, standards, of, christian, taste, and, beauty, while, recognizing, cultural, differences, our, dress, is, to, be, simple, modest, and, neat, befitting, those, whose, true, beauty, does, not, consist, of, outward, adornment, but, in, the, imperishable, ornament, of, a, gentle, and, quiet, spirit, accordingly,

doctrines, and, in, relation, to, ellen, g, white, and, her, status, within, the, church, and, in, relation, to, alleged, exclusivist, issues, several, teachings, which, have, come, under, scrutiny, are, the, annihilationist, view, of, hell, the, investigative, judgment, and, a, related, view, of, the, atonement, and, the, sabbath, critics, such, as, evangelical, anthony, hoekema, who, felt, that, adventists, were, more, in, agreement, with, arminianism, argued, that, some, adventist, doctrines, were, heterodox, in, addition, hoekema, also, claimed, that, adventist, doctrine, suffers, from, legalism, while, critics, such, as, hoekema, have, classified, adventism, as, a, sectarian, group, on, the, basis, of, its, atypical, doctrines, it, has, been, accepted, as, more, mainstream, by, protestant, evangelicals, since, its, meetings, and, discussions, with, evangelicals, in, the, 1950s, billy, graham, invited, adventists, to, be, part, of, his, crusades, after, eternity, a, conservative, christian, magazine, edited, by, donald, barnhouse, asserted, in, 1956, that, adventists, are, christians, he, also, later, stated, they, are, sound, on, the, great, new, testament, doctrines, including, grace, and, redemption, through, the, vicarious, offering, of, jesus, christ, once, for, all, walter, martin, who, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, father, of, the, counter, cult, apologetics, movement, within, evangelicalism, authored, the, truth, about, seventh, day, adventists, 1960, which, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, way, adventism, was, viewed, it, is, perfectly, possible, to, be, a, seventh, day, adventist, and, be, a, true, follower, of, jesus, christ, despite, heterodox, concepts, later, on, martin, planned, to, write, a, new, book, on, seventh, day, adventism, with, the, assistance, of, kenneth, r, samples, samples, subsequently, authored, from, controversy, to, crisis, an, updated, assessment, of, seventh, day, adventism, which, upholds, martin, s, view, for, that, segment, of, adventism, which, holds, to, the, position, stated, in, qod, and, further, expressed, in, the, evangelical, adventist, movement, of, the, last, few, decades, however, samples, also, claimed, that, traditional, adventism, appeared, to, be, moving, further, away, from, a, number, of, positions, taken, in, qod, and, at, least, at, glacier, view, seemed, to, have, gained, the, support, of, many, administrators, and, leaders, ellen, g, white, s, status, as, a, modern, day, prophet, has, also, been, criticized, in, the, questions, on, doctrine, era, evangelicals, expressed, concern, about, adventism, s, understanding, of, the, relationship, of, white, s, writings, to, the, inspired, canon, of, scripture, the, adventist, fundamental, beliefs, maintain, that, the, bible, is, the, standard, by, which, all, teaching, and, experience, must, be, tested, a, common, criticism, of, ellen, white, widely, popularized, by, walter, t, rea, ronald, numbers, and, others, is, the, claim, of, plagiarism, from, other, authors, an, independent, lawyer, specializing, in, plagiarism, vincent, l, ramik, was, engaged, to, undertake, a, study, of, ellen, g, white, s, writings, during, the, early, 1980s, and, concluded, that, they, were, conclusively, unplagiaristic, when, the, plagiarism, charge, ignited, a, significant, debate, during, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, adventist, general, conference, commissioned, a, major, study, by, dr, fred, veltman, the, ensuing, project, became, known, as, the, life, of, christ, research, project, veltman, examined, fifteen, randomly, selected, chapters, of, the, desire, of, ages, for, evidence, of, literary, dependence, and, concluded, on, an, average, we, may, say, that, 31, 4, percent, of, the, da, text, is, dependent, to, some, extent, on, literary, sources, the, results, are, available, at, the, general, conference, archives, dr, roger, w, coon, david, j, conklin, dr, denis, fortin, king, and, morgan, and, morgan, among, others, undertook, the, refutation, of, the, accusations, of, plagiarism, at, the, conclusion, of, his, report, ramik, states, it, is, impossible, to, imagine, that, the, intention, of, ellen, g, white, as, reflected, in, her, writings, and, the, unquestionably, prodigious, efforts, involved, therein, was, anything, other, than, a, sincerely, motivated, and, unselfish, effort, to, place, the, understandings, of, biblical, truths, in, a, coherent, form, for, all, to, see, and, comprehend, most, certainly, the, nature, and, content, of, her, writings, had, but, one, hope, and, intent, namely, the, furthering, of, mankind, s, understanding, of, the, word, of, god, considering, all, factors, necessary, in, reaching, a, just, conclusion, on, this, issue, it, is, submitted, that, the, writings, of, ellen, g, white, were, conclusively, unplagiaristic, critics, have, alleged, that, certain, adventist, beliefs, and, practices, are, exclusivist, in, nature, and, they, point, to, the, adventist, claim, to, be, the, remnant, church, and, the, traditional, protestant, association, of, roman, catholicism, with, babylon, these, attitudes, are, said, to, legitimize, the, proselytising, of, christians, from, other, denominations, in, response, to, such, criticisms, adventist, theologians, have, stated, that, the, doctrine, of, the, remnant, does, not, preclude, the, existence, of, genuine, christians, in, other, denominations, but, is, concerned, with, institutions, throughout, the, history, of, the, denomination, there, have, been, a, number, of, groups, that, have, left, the, church, and, formed, their, own, movements, following, world, war, i, a, group, known, as, the, seventh, day, adventist, reform, movement, was, formed, as, a, result, of, the, actions, of, l, r, conradi, and, certain, european, church, leaders, during, the, war, who, decided, that, it, was, acceptable, for, adventists, to, take, part, in, war, those, who, were, opposed, to, this, stand, and, refused, to, participate, in, the, war, were, declared, disfellowshipped, by, their, local, church, leaders, at, the, time, when, the, church, leaders, from, the, general, conference, came, and, admonished, the, local, european, leaders, after, the, war, to, try, to, heal, the, damage, and, bring, the, members, together, it, met, with, resistance, from, those, who, had, suffered, under, those, leaders, their, attempts, at, reconciliation, failed, after, the, war, and, the, group, became, organized, as, a, separate, church, at, a, conference, that, was, held, on, july, 14, 20, 1925, the, movement, officially, incorporated, in, 1949, in, 2005, in, another, attempt, to, examine, and, resolve, what, its, german, leaders, had, done, the, mainstream, church, apologized, for, its, failures, during, world, war, ii, stating, that, they, deeply, regret, any, participation, in, or, support, of, nazi, activities, during, the, war, by, the, german, and, austrian, leadership, of, the, church, in, the, soviet, union, the, same, issues, produced, the, group, known, as, the, true, and, free, seventh, day, adventists, this, also, formed, as, the, result, of, a, schism, within, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, in, europe, during, world, war, i, over, the, position, its, european, church, leaders, took, on, having, its, members, join, the,
