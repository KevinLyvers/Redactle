dialectic, greek, dialektik, german, dialektik, also, known, as, the, dialectical, method, refers, originally, to, dialogue, between, people, holding, different, points, of, view, about, a, subject, but, wishing, to, arrive, at, the, truth, through, reasoned, argumentation, dialectic, resembles, debate, but, the, concept, excludes, subjective, elements, such, as, emotional, appeal, and, rhetoric, it, has, its, origins, in, ancient, philosophy, and, continued, to, be, developed, in, the, middle, ages, hegelianism, refigured, dialectic, to, no, longer, refer, to, a, literal, dialogue, instead, the, term, takes, on, the, specialized, meaning, of, development, by, way, of, overcoming, internal, contradictions, dialectical, materialism, a, theory, advanced, by, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, adapted, the, hegelian, dialectic, into, a, materialist, theory, of, history, the, legacy, of, hegelian, and, marxian, dialectics, has, been, criticized, by, philosophers, such, as, karl, popper, and, mario, bunge, who, considered, it, unscientific, dialectic, implies, a, developmental, process, and, so, does, not, naturally, fit, within, classical, logic, nevertheless, some, twentieth, century, logicians, have, attempted, to, formalize, it, there, are, a, variety, of, meanings, of, dialectic, or, dialectics, within, western, philosophy, in, classical, philosophy, dialectic, is, a, form, of, reasoning, based, upon, dialogue, of, arguments, and, counter, arguments, advocating, propositions, theses, and, counter, propositions, antitheses, the, outcome, of, such, a, dialectic, might, be, the, refutation, of, a, relevant, proposition, or, a, synthesis, a, combination, of, the, opposing, assertions, or, a, qualitative, improvement, of, the, dialogue, the, term, dialectic, owes, much, of, its, prestige, to, its, role, in, the, philosophies, of, socrates, and, plato, in, the, greek, classical, period, 5th, to, 4th, centuries, bc, aristotle, said, that, it, was, the, pre, socratic, philosopher, zeno, of, elea, who, invented, dialectic, of, which, the, dialogues, of, plato, are, examples, of, the, socratic, dialectical, method, the, socratic, dialogues, are, a, particular, form, of, dialectic, known, as, the, method, of, elenchus, literally, refutation, scrutiny, whereby, a, series, of, questions, clarifies, a, more, precise, statement, of, a, vague, belief, logical, consequences, of, that, statement, are, explored, and, a, contradiction, is, discovered, the, method, is, largely, destructive, in, that, false, belief, is, exposed, and, only, constructive, in, that, this, exposure, may, lead, to, further, search, for, truth, the, detection, of, error, does, not, amount, to, a, proof, of, the, antithesis, for, example, a, contradiction, in, the, consequences, of, a, definition, of, piety, does, not, provide, a, correct, definition, the, principal, aim, of, socratic, activity, may, be, to, improve, the, soul, of, the, interlocutors, by, freeing, them, from, unrecognized, errors, or, indeed, by, teaching, them, the, spirit, of, inquiry, in, common, cases, socrates, uses, enthymemes, as, the, foundation, of, his, argument, for, example, in, the, euthyphro, socrates, asks, euthyphro, to, provide, a, definition, of, piety, euthyphro, replies, that, the, pious, is, that, which, is, loved, by, the, gods, but, socrates, also, has, euthyphro, agreeing, that, the, gods, are, quarrelsome, and, their, quarrels, like, human, quarrels, concern, objects, of, love, or, hatred, therefore, socrates, reasons, at, least, one, thing, exists, that, certain, gods, love, but, other, gods, hate, again, euthyphro, agrees, socrates, concludes, that, if, euthyphro, s, definition, of, piety, is, acceptable, then, there, must, exist, at, least, one, thing, that, is, both, pious, and, impious, as, it, is, both, loved, and, hated, by, the, gods, which, euthyphro, admits, is, absurd, thus, euthyphro, is, brought, to, a, realization, by, this, dialectical, method, that, his, definition, of, piety, is, not, sufficiently, meaningful, in, another, example, in, plato, s, gorgias, dialectic, occurs, between, socrates, the, sophist, gorgias, and, two, men, polus, and, callicles, because, socrates, ultimate, goal, was, to, reach, true, knowledge, he, was, even, willing, to, change, his, own, views, in, order, to, arrive, at, the, truth, the, fundamental, goal, of, dialectic, in, this, instance, was, to, establish, a, precise, definition, of, the, subject, in, this, case, rhetoric, and, with, the, use, of, argumentation, and, questioning, make, the, subject, even, more, precise, in, the, gorgias, socrates, reaches, the, truth, by, asking, a, series, of, questions, and, in, return, receiving, short, clear, answers, in, platonism, and, neoplatonism, dialectic, assumed, an, ontological, and, metaphysical, role, in, that, it, became, the, process, whereby, the, intellect, passes, from, sensibles, to, intelligibles, rising, from, idea, to, idea, until, it, finally, grasps, the, supreme, idea, the, first, principle, which, is, the, origin, of, all, the, philosopher, is, consequently, a, dialectician, in, this, sense, dialectic, is, a, process, of, inquiry, that, does, away, with, hypotheses, up, to, the, first, principle, it, slowly, embraces, multiplicity, in, unity, the, philosopher, simon, blackburn, wrote, that, the, dialectic, in, this, sense, is, used, to, understand, the, total, process, of, enlightenment, whereby, the, philosopher, is, educated, so, as, to, achieve, knowledge, of, the, supreme, good, the, form, of, the, good, logic, which, could, be, considered, to, include, dialectic, was, one, of, the, three, liberal, arts, taught, in, medieval, universities, as, part, of, the, trivium, the, other, elements, were, rhetoric, and, grammar, based, mainly, on, aristotle, the, first, medieval, philosopher, to, work, on, dialectics, was, boethius, 480, 524, after, him, many, scholastic, philosophers, also, made, use, of, dialectics, in, their, works, such, as, abelard, william, of, sherwood, garlandus, compotista, walter, burley, roger, swyneshed, william, of, ockham, and, thomas, aquinas, this, dialectic, a, quaestio, disputata, was, formed, as, follows, the, concept, of, dialectics, was, given, new, life, at, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, by, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, whose, dialectical, model, of, nature, and, of, history, made, dialectics, a, fundamental, aspect, of, reality, instead, of, regarding, the, contradictions, into, which, dialectics, leads, as, evidence, of, the, limits, of, pure, reason, as, immanuel, kant, had, argued, hegel, was, influenced, by, johann, gottlieb, fichte, s, conception, of, synthesis, although, hegel, didn, t, adopt, fichte, s, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, language, except, to, describe, kant, s, philosophy, rather, hegel, argued, that, such, language, was, a, lifeless, schema, imposed, on, various, contents, whereas, he, saw, his, own, dialectic, as, flowing, out, of, the, inner, life, and, self, movement, of, the, content, itself, in, the, mid, 19th, century, hegelian, dialectic, was, appropriated, by, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, and, retooled, in, what, they, considered, to, be, a, nonidealistic, manner, it, would, also, become, a, crucial, part, of, later, representations, of, marxism, as, a, philosophy, of, dialectical, materialism, these, representations, often, contrasted, dramatically, and, led, to, vigorous, debate, among, different, marxist, groups, the, hegelian, dialectic, describes, changes, in, the, forms, of, thought, through, their, own, internal, contradictions, into, concrete, forms, that, overcome, previous, oppositions, this, dialectic, is, sometimes, presented, in, a, threefold, manner, as, first, stated, by, heinrich, moritz, chalyb, us, as, comprising, three, dialectical, stages, of, development, a, thesis, giving, rise, to, its, reaction, an, antithesis, which, contradicts, or, negates, the, thesis, and, the, tension, between, the, two, being, resolved, by, means, of, a, synthesis, although, hegel, opposed, these, terms, by, contrast, the, terms, abstract, negative, and, concrete, suggest, a, flaw, or, an, incompleteness, in, any, initial, thesis, for, hegel, the, concrete, must, always, pass, through, the, phase, of, the, negative, that, is, mediation, this, is, the, essence, of, what, is, popularly, called, hegelian, dialectics, to, describe, the, activity, of, overcoming, the, negative, hegel, often, used, the, term, aufhebung, variously, translated, into, english, as, sublation, or, overcoming, to, conceive, of, the, working, of, the, dialectic, roughly, the, term, indicates, preserving, the, true, portion, of, an, idea, thing, society, and, so, forth, while, moving, beyond, its, limitations, what, is, sublated, on, the, one, hand, is, overcome, but, on, the, other, hand, is, preserved, and, maintained, as, in, the, socratic, dialectic, hegel, claimed, to, proceed, by, making, implicit, contradictions, explicit, each, stage, of, the, process, is, the, product, of, contradictions, inherent, or, implicit, in, the, preceding, stage, on, his, view, the, purpose, of, dialectics, is, to, study, things, in, their, own, being, and, movement, and, thus, to, demonstrate, the, finitude, of, the, partial, categories, of, understanding, for, hegel, even, history, can, be, reconstructed, as, a, unified, dialectic, the, major, stages, of, which, chart, a, progression, from, self, alienation, as, servitude, to, self, unification, and, realization, as, the, rational, constitutional, state, of, free, and, equal, citizens, marxist, dialectic, is, a, form, of, hegelian, dialectic, which, applies, to, the, study, of, historical, materialism, marxist, dialectic, is, thus, a, method, by, which, one, can, examine, social, and, economic, behaviors, it, is, the, foundation, of, the, philosophy, of, dialectical, materialism, which, forms, the, basis, of, historical, materialism, in, the, marxist, tradition, dialectic, refers, to, regular, and, mutual, relationships, interactions, and, processes, in, nature, society, and, human, thought, 257, a, dialectical, relationship, is, a, relationship, in, which, two, phenomena, or, ideas, mutually, impact, each, other, leading, to, development, and, negation, 257, development, refers, to, the, change, and, motion, of, phenomena, and, ideas, from, less, advanced, to, more, advanced, or, from, less, complete, to, more, complete, 257, dialectical, negation, refers, to, a, stage, of, development, in, which, a, contradiction, between, two, previous, subjects, gives, rise, to, a, new, subject, 257, in, the, marxist, view, dialectical, negation, is, never, an, endpoint, but, instead, creates, new, conditions, for, further, development, and, negation, 257, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, writing, several, decades, after, hegel, s, death, proposed, that, hegel, s, dialectic, is, too, abstract, against, this, marx, presented, his, own, dialectic, method, which, he, claimed, to, be, direct, opposite, of, hegel, s, method, marxist, dialectics, is, exemplified, in, das, kapital, as, marx, explained, dialectical, materialism, it, includes, in, its, comprehension, an, affirmative, recognition, of, the, existing, state, of, things, at, the, same, time, also, the, recognition, of, the, negation, of, that, state, of, its, inevitable, breaking, up, because, it, regards, every, historically, developed, social, form, as, in, fluid, movement, and, therefore, takes, into, account, its, transient, nature, not, less, than, its, momentary, existence, because, it, lets, nothing, impose, upon, it, and, is, in, its, essence, critical, and, revolutionary, class, struggle, is, the, primary, contradiction, to, be, resolved, by, marxist, dialectics, because, of, its, central, role, in, the, social, and, political, lives, of, a, society, nonetheless, marx, and, marxists, developed, the, concept, of, class, struggle, to, comprehend, the, dialectical, contradictions, between, mental, and, manual, labor, and, between, town, and, country, hence, philosophic, contradiction, is, central, to, the, development, of, dialectics, the, progress, from, quantity, to, quality, the, acceleration, of, gradual, social, change, the, negation, of, the, initial, development, of, the, status, quo, the, negation, of, that, negation, and, the, high, level, recurrence, of, features, of, the, original, status, quo, friedrich, engels, further, proposed, that, nature, itself, is, dialectical, and, that, this, is, a, very, simple, process, which, is, taking, place, everywhere, and, every, day, his, dialectical, law, of, the, transformation, of, quantity, into, quality, and, vice, versa, corresponds, according, to, christian, fuchs, to, the, concept, of, phase, transition, and, anticipated, the, concept, of, emergence, a, hundred, years, ahead, of, his, time, for, vladimir, lenin, the, primary, feature, of, marx, s, dialectical, materialism, lenin, s, term, is, its, application, of, materialist, philosophy, to, history, and, social, sciences, lenin, s, main, contribution, to, the, philosophy, of, dialectical, materialism, is, his, theory, of, reflection, which, presents, human, consciousness, as, a, dynamic, reflection, of, the, objective, material, world, that, fully, shapes, its, contents, and, structure, later, stalin, s, works, on, the, subject, established, a, rigid, and, formalistic, division, of, marxist, leninist, theory, into, dialectical, materialism, and, historical, materialism, while, the, first, was, supposed, to, be, the, key, method, and, theory, of, the, philosophy, of, nature, the, second, was, the, soviet, version, of, the, philosophy, of, history, soviet, systems, theory, pioneer, alexander, bogdanov, viewed, hegelian, and, materialist, dialectic, as, progressive, albeit, inexact, and, diffuse, attempts, at, achieving, what, he, called, tektology, or, a, universal, science, of, organization, dialectical, naturalism, is, a, term, coined, by, american, philosopher, murray, bookchin, to, describe, the, philosophical, underpinnings, of, the, political, program, of, social, ecology, dialectical, naturalism, explores, the, complex, interrelationship, between, social, problems, and, the, direct, consequences, they, have, on, the, ecological, impact, of, human, society, bookchin, offered, dialectical, naturalism, as, a, contrast, to, what, he, saw, as, the, empyrean, basically, antinaturalistic, dialectical, idealism, of, hegel, and, the, wooden, often, scientistic, dialectical, materialism, of, orthodox, marxists, neo, orthodoxy, in, europe, also, known, as, theology, of, crisis, and, dialectical, theology, is, an, approach, to, theology, in, protestantism, that, was, developed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, 1914, 1918, it, is, characterized, as, a, reaction, against, doctrines, of, 19th, century, liberal, theology, and, a, more, positive, reevaluation, of, the, teachings, of, the, reformation, much, of, which, had, been, in, decline, especially, in, western, europe, since, the, late, 18th, century, it, is, primarily, associated, with, two, swiss, professors, and, pastors, karl, barth, 1886, 1968, and, emil, brunner, 1899, 1966, even, though, barth, himself, expressed, his, unease, in, the, use, of, the, term, in, dialectical, theology, the, difference, and, opposition, between, god, and, human, beings, is, stressed, in, such, a, way, that, all, human, attempts, at, overcoming, this, opposition, through, moral, religious, or, philosophical, idealism, must, be, characterized, as, sin, in, the, death, of, christ, humanity, is, negated, and, overcome, but, this, judgment, also, points, forwards, to, the, resurrection, in, which, humanity, is, reestablished, in, christ, for, barth, this, meant, that, only, through, god, s, no, to, everything, human, can, his, yes, be, perceived, applied, to, traditional, themes, of, protestant, theology, such, as, double, predestination, this, means, that, election, and, reprobation, cannot, be, viewed, as, a, quantitative, limitation, of, god, s, action, rather, it, must, be, seen, as, its, qualitative, definition, as, christ, bore, the, rejection, as, well, as, the, election, of, god, for, all, humanity, every, person, is, subject, to, both, aspects, of, god, s, double, predestination, dialectic, prominently, figured, in, bernard, lonergan, s, philosophy, in, his, books, insight, and, method, in, theology, michael, shute, wrote, about, lonergan, s, use, of, dialectic, in, the, origins, of, lonergan, s, notion, of, the, dialectic, of, history, for, lonergan, dialectic, is, both, individual, and, operative, in, community, simply, described, it, is, a, dynamic, process, that, results, in, something, new, for, the, sake, of, greater, precision, let, us, say, that, a, dialectic, is, a, concrete, unfolding, of, linked, but, opposed, principles, of, change, thus, there, will, be, a, dialectic, if, 1, there, is, an, aggregate, of, events, of, a, determinate, character, 2, the, events, may, be, traced, to, either, or, both, of, two, principles, 3, the, principles, are, opposed, yet, bound, together, and, 4, they, are, modified, by, the, changes, that, successively, result, from, them, dialectic, is, one, of, the, eight, functional, specialties, lonergan, envisaged, for, theology, to, bring, this, discipline, into, the, modern, world, lonergan, believed, that, the, lack, of, an, agreed, method, among, scholars, had, inhibited, substantive, agreement, from, being, reached, and, progress, from, being, made, compared, to, the, natural, sciences, karl, rahner, s, j, however, criticized, lonergan, s, theological, method, in, a, short, article, entitled, some, critical, thoughts, on, functional, specialties, in, theology, where, he, stated, lonergan, s, theological, methodology, seems, to, me, to, be, so, generic, that, it, really, fits, every, science, and, hence, is, not, the, methodology, of, theology, as, such, but, only, a, very, general, methodology, of, science, friedrich, nietzsche, viewed, dialectic, as, a, method, that, imposes, artificial, boundaries, and, suppresses, the, richness, and, diversity, of, reality, he, rejected, the, notion, that, truth, can, be, fully, grasped, through, dialectical, reasoning, and, offered, a, critique, of, dialectic, challenging, its, traditional, framework, and, emphasizing, the, limitations, of, its, approach, to, understanding, reality, he, expressed, skepticism, towards, its, methodology, and, implications, in, his, work, twilight, of, the, idols, i, mistrust, all, systematizers, and, i, avoid, them, the, will, to, a, system, is, a, lack, of, integrity, 42, in, the, same, book, nietzsche, criticized, socrates, dialectics, because, he, believed, it, prioritized, reason, over, instinct, resulting, in, the, suppression, of, individual, passions, and, the, imposition, of, an, artificial, morality, 47, karl, popper, attacked, the, dialectic, repeatedly, in, 1937, he, wrote, and, delivered, a, paper, entitled, what, is, dialectic, in, which, he, criticized, the, dialectics, of, hegel, marx, and, engels, for, their, willingness, to, put, up, with, contradictions, he, argued, that, accepting, contradiction, as, a, valid, form, of, logic, would, lead, to, the, principle, of, explosion, and, thus, trivialism, popper, concluded, the, essay, with, these, words, the, whole, development, of, dialectic, should, be, a, warning, against, the, dangers, inherent, in, philosophical, system, building, it, should, remind, us, that, philosophy, should, not, be, made, a, basis, for, any, sort, of, scientific, system, and, that, philosophers, should, be, much, more, modest, in, their, claims, one, task, which, they, can, fulfill, quite, usefully, is, the, study, of, the, critical, methods, of, science, seventy, years, later, nicholas, rescher, responded, that, popper, s, critique, touches, only, a, hyperbolic, version, of, dialectic, and, he, quipped, ironically, there, is, something, decidedly, dialectical, about, popper, s, critique, of, dialectics, around, the, same, time, as, popper, s, critique, was, published, philosopher, sidney, hook, discussed, the, sense, and, nonsense, in, dialectic, and, rejected, two, conceptions, of, dialectic, as, unscientific, but, accepted, one, conception, as, a, convenient, organizing, category, the, philosopher, of, science, and, physicist, mario, bunge, repeatedly, criticized, hegelian, and, marxian, dialectics, calling, them, fuzzy, and, remote, from, science, and, a, disastrous, legacy, he, concluded, the, so, called, laws, of, dialectics, such, as, formulated, by, engels, 1940, 1954, and, lenin, 1947, 1981, are, false, insofar, as, they, are, intelligible, poe, yu, ze, wan, reviewing, bunge, s, criticisms, of, dialectics, found, bunge, s, arguments, to, be, important, and, sensible, but, he, thought, that, dialectics, could, still, serve, some, heuristic, purposes, for, scientists, wan, pointed, out, that, scientists, such, as, the, american, marxist, biologists, richard, levins, and, richard, lewontin, authors, of, the, dialectical, biologist, and, the, german, american, evolutionary, biologist, ernst, mayr, not, a, marxist, himself, have, found, agreement, between, dialectical, principles, and, their, own, scientific, outlooks, although, wan, opined, that, engels, s, laws, of, dialectics, in, fact, explain, nothing, even, some, marxists, are, critical, of, the, term, dialectics, for, instance, michael, heinrich, wrote, more, often, than, not, the, grandiose, rhetoric, about, dialectics, is, reducible, to, the, simple, fact, that, everything, is, dependent, upon, everything, else, and, is, in, a, state, of, interaction, and, that, it, s, all, rather, complicated, which, is, true, in, most, cases, but, doesn, t, really, say, anything, since, the, late, 20th, century, european, and, american, logicians, have, attempted, to, provide, mathematical, foundations, for, dialectic, through, formalisation, 201, 372, although, logic, has, been, related, to, dialectic, since, ancient, times, 51, 140, there, have, been, pre, formal, and, partially, formal, treatises, on, argument, and, dialectic, from, authors, such, as, stephen, toulmin, the, uses, of, argument, 1958, 203, 256, nicholas, rescher, dialectics, a, controversy, oriented, approach, to, the, theory, of, knowledge, 1977, 330, 336, and, frans, h, van, eemeren, and, rob, grootendorst, pragma, dialectics, 1980s, 517, 614, one, can, include, works, of, the, communities, of, informal, logic, and, paraconsistent, logic, 373, 424, building, on, theories, of, defeasible, reasoning, see, john, l, pollock, systems, have, been, built, that, define, well, formedness, of, arguments, rules, governing, the, process, of, introducing, arguments, based, on, fixed, assumptions, and, rules, for, shifting, burden, 615, 675, many, of, these, logics, appear, in, the, special, area, of, artificial, intelligence, and, law, though, the, computer, scientists, interest, in, formalizing, dialectic, originates, in, a, desire, to, build, decision, support, and, computer, supported, collaborative, work, systems, dialectic, itself, can, be, formalised, as, moves, in, a, game, where, an, advocate, for, the, truth, of, a, proposition, and, an, opponent, argue, 301, 372, such, games, can, provide, a, semantics, of, logic, one, that, is, very, general, in, applicability, 314, mathematician, william, lawvere, interpreted, dialectics, in, the, setting, of, categorical, logic, in, terms, of, adjunctions, between, idempotent, monads, this, perspective, may, be, useful, in, the, context, of, theoretical, computer, science, where, the, duality, between, syntax, and, semantics, can, be, interpreted, as, a, dialectic, in, this, sense, for, example, the, curry, howard, equivalence, is, such, an, adjunction, or, more, generally, the, duality, between, closed, monoidal, categories, and, their, internal, logic
