panentheism, p, n, n, i, z, m, all, in, god, from, the, greek, p, n, all, en, in, and, the, s, god, is, the, belief, that, the, divine, intersects, every, part, of, the, universe, and, also, extends, beyond, space, and, time, the, term, was, coined, by, the, german, philosopher, karl, krause, in, 1828, after, reviewing, hindu, scripture, to, distinguish, the, ideas, of, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, and, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, 1775, 1854, about, the, relation, of, god, and, the, universe, from, the, supposed, pantheism, of, baruch, spinoza, unlike, pantheism, which, holds, that, the, divine, and, the, universe, are, identical, panentheism, maintains, an, ontological, distinction, between, the, divine, and, the, non, divine, and, the, significance, of, both, in, panentheism, the, universal, spirit, is, present, everywhere, which, at, the, same, time, transcends, all, things, created, while, pantheism, asserts, that, all, is, god, panentheism, claims, that, god, is, greater, than, the, universe, some, versions, of, panentheism, suggest, that, the, universe, is, nothing, more, than, the, manifestation, of, god, in, addition, some, forms, indicate, that, the, universe, is, contained, within, god, like, in, the, kabbalah, concept, of, tzimtzum, much, of, hindu, thought, is, highly, characterized, by, panentheism, and, pantheism, the, religious, beliefs, of, neoplatonism, can, be, regarded, as, panentheistic, plotinus, taught, that, there, was, an, ineffable, transcendent, god, the, one, to, en, of, which, subsequent, realities, were, emanations, from, the, one, emanates, the, divine, mind, nous, and, the, cosmic, soul, psyche, in, neoplatonism, the, world, itself, is, god, according, to, plato, s, timaeus, 37, this, concept, of, divinity, is, associated, with, that, of, the, logos, which, had, originated, centuries, earlier, with, heraclitus, c, 535, 475, bc, the, logos, pervades, the, cosmos, whereby, all, thoughts, and, all, things, originate, or, as, heraclitus, said, he, who, hears, not, me, but, the, logos, will, say, all, is, one, neoplatonists, such, as, iamblichus, attempted, to, reconcile, this, perspective, by, adding, another, hypostasis, above, the, original, monad, of, force, or, dynamis, this, new, all, pervasive, monad, encompassed, all, creation, and, its, original, uncreated, emanations, baruch, spinoza, later, claimed, that, whatsoever, is, is, in, god, and, without, god, nothing, can, be, or, be, conceived, individual, things, are, nothing, but, modifications, of, the, attributes, of, god, or, modes, by, which, the, attributes, of, god, are, expressed, in, a, fixed, and, definite, manner, though, spinoza, has, been, called, the, prophet, and, prince, of, pantheism, in, a, letter, to, henry, oldenburg, spinoza, states, that, as, to, the, view, of, certain, people, that, i, identify, god, with, nature, taken, as, a, kind, of, mass, or, corporeal, matter, they, are, quite, mistaken, for, spinoza, our, universe, cosmos, is, a, mode, under, two, attributes, of, thought, and, extension, god, has, infinitely, many, other, attributes, which, are, not, present, in, our, world, according, to, german, philosopher, karl, jaspers, when, spinoza, wrote, deus, sive, natura, god, or, nature, spinoza, did, not, mean, to, say, that, god, and, nature, are, interchangeable, terms, but, rather, that, god, s, transcendence, was, attested, by, his, infinitely, many, attributes, and, that, two, attributes, known, by, humans, namely, thought, and, extension, signified, god, s, immanence, furthermore, martial, gu, roult, suggested, the, term, panentheism, rather, than, pantheism, to, describe, spinoza, s, view, of, the, relation, between, god, and, the, world, the, world, is, not, god, but, it, is, in, a, strong, sense, in, god, yet, american, philosopher, and, self, described, panentheist, charles, hartshorne, referred, to, spinoza, s, philosophy, as, classical, pantheism, and, distinguished, spinoza, s, philosophy, from, panentheism, in, 1828, the, german, philosopher, karl, christian, friedrich, krause, 1781, 1832, seeking, to, reconcile, monotheism, and, pantheism, coined, the, term, panentheism, from, the, ancient, greek, expression, p, n, en, the, literally, all, in, god, this, conception, of, god, influenced, new, england, transcendentalists, such, as, ralph, waldo, emerson, the, term, was, popularized, by, charles, hartshorne, in, his, development, of, process, theology, and, has, also, been, closely, identified, with, the, new, thought, the, formalization, of, this, term, in, the, west, in, the, 19th, century, was, not, new, philosophical, treatises, had, been, written, on, it, in, the, context, of, hinduism, for, millennia, philosophers, who, embraced, panentheism, have, included, thomas, hill, green, 1839, 1882, james, ward, 1843, 1925, andrew, seth, pringle, pattison, 1856, 1931, and, samuel, alexander, 1859, 1938, beginning, in, the, 1940s, hartshorne, examined, numerous, conceptions, of, god, he, reviewed, and, discarded, pantheism, deism, and, pandeism, in, favor, of, panentheism, finding, that, such, a, doctrine, contains, all, of, deism, and, pandeism, except, their, arbitrary, negations, hartshorne, formulated, god, as, a, being, who, could, become, more, perfect, he, has, absolute, perfection, in, categories, for, which, absolute, perfection, is, possible, and, relative, perfection, i, e, is, superior, to, all, others, in, categories, for, which, perfection, cannot, be, precisely, determined, the, reverend, zen, master, soyen, shaku, was, the, first, zen, buddhist, abbot, to, tour, the, united, states, in, 1905, 6, he, wrote, a, series, of, essays, collected, into, the, book, zen, for, americans, in, the, essay, titled, the, god, conception, of, buddhism, he, attempts, to, explain, how, a, buddhist, looks, at, the, ultimate, without, an, anthropomorphic, god, figure, while, still, being, able, to, relate, to, the, term, god, in, a, buddhist, sense, at, the, outset, let, me, state, that, buddhism, is, not, atheistic, as, the, term, is, ordinarily, understood, it, has, certainly, a, god, the, highest, reality, and, truth, through, which, and, in, which, this, universe, exists, however, the, followers, of, buddhism, usually, avoid, the, term, god, for, it, savors, so, much, of, christianity, whose, spirit, is, not, always, exactly, in, accord, with, the, buddhist, interpretation, of, religious, experience, again, buddhism, is, not, pantheistic, in, the, sense, that, it, identifies, the, universe, with, god, on, the, other, hand, the, buddhist, god, is, absolute, and, transcendent, this, world, being, merely, its, manifestation, is, necessarily, fragmental, and, imperfect, to, define, more, exactly, the, buddhist, notion, of, the, highest, being, it, may, be, convenient, to, borrow, the, term, very, happily, coined, by, a, modern, german, scholar, panentheism, according, to, which, god, is, all, and, one, and, more, than, the, totality, of, existence, the, essay, then, goes, on, to, explain, first, utilizing, the, term, god, for, the, american, audience, to, get, an, initial, understanding, of, what, he, means, by, panentheism, and, then, discusses, the, terms, that, buddhism, uses, in, place, of, god, such, as, dharmakaya, buddha, or, adi, buddha, and, tathagata, panentheism, is, also, a, feature, of, some, christian, philosophical, theologies, and, resonates, strongly, within, the, theological, tradition, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, it, also, appears, in, process, theology, process, theological, thinkers, are, generally, regarded, in, the, christian, west, as, unorthodox, furthermore, process, philosophical, thought, is, widely, believed, to, have, paved, the, way, for, open, theism, a, movement, that, tends, to, associate, itself, primarily, with, the, evangelical, branch, of, protestantism, but, is, also, generally, considered, unorthodox, by, most, evangelicals, a, number, of, ordained, catholic, mystics, including, richard, rohr, david, steindl, rast, and, thomas, keating, have, suggested, that, panentheism, is, the, original, view, of, christianity, they, hold, that, such, a, view, is, directly, supported, by, mystical, experience, and, the, teachings, of, jesus, and, saint, paul, richard, rohr, surmises, this, in, his, 2019, book, the, universal, christ, but, paul, merely, took, incarnationalism, to, its, universal, and, logical, conclusions, we, see, that, in, his, bold, exclamation, there, is, only, christ, he, is, everything, and, he, is, in, everything, colossians, 3, 11, if, i, were, to, write, that, today, people, would, call, me, a, pantheist, the, universe, is, god, whereas, i, am, really, a, panentheist, god, lies, within, all, things, but, also, transcends, them, exactly, like, both, jesus, and, paul, similarly, david, steindl, rast, posits, that, christianity, s, original, panentheism, is, being, revealed, through, contemporary, mystical, insight, what, characterizes, our, moment, in, history, is, the, collapse, of, christian, theism, gratefulness, mysticism, makes, us, realize, that, christianity, never, was, theistic, but, panentheistic, faith, in, god, as, triune, implied, this, from, the, very, beginning, now, we, are, becoming, aware, of, it, it, becomes, obvious, at, the, same, time, that, we, share, this, trinitarian, experience, of, divine, life, with, all, human, beings, as, a, spiritual, undercurrent, in, all, religions, an, undercurrent, older, and, more, powerful, than, the, various, doctrines, at, the, core, of, interreligious, dialogue, flows, this, shared, spirituality, of, gratefulness, a, spirituality, strong, enough, to, restore, to, our, broken, world, unity, this, sentiment, is, mirrored, in, thomas, keating, s, 1993, article, clarifications, regarding, centering, prayer, pantheism, is, usually, defined, as, the, identification, of, god, with, creation, in, such, a, way, that, the, two, are, indistinguishable, panentheism, means, that, god, is, present, in, all, creation, by, virtue, of, his, omnipresence, and, omnipotence, sustaining, every, creature, in, being, without, being, identified, with, any, creature, the, latter, understanding, is, what, jesus, seems, to, have, been, describing, when, he, prays, that, all, might, be, one, father, as, we, are, one, and, that, they, may, also, be, in, us, john, 17, 22, again, and, again, in, the, last, supper, discourse, he, speaks, of, this, oneness, and, his, intentions, to, send, his, spirit, to, dwell, within, us, if, we, understand, the, writings, of, the, great, mystics, rightly, they, experience, god, living, within, them, all, the, time, thus, the, affirmation, of, god, s, transcendence, must, always, be, balanced, by, the, affirmation, of, his, imminence, both, on, the, natural, plane, and, on, the, plane, of, grace, panentheistic, conceptions, of, god, occur, amongst, some, modern, theologians, process, theology, and, creation, spirituality, two, recent, developments, in, christian, theology, contain, panentheistic, ideas, charles, hartshorne, 1897, 2000, who, conjoined, process, theology, with, panentheism, maintained, a, lifelong, membership, in, the, methodist, church, but, was, also, a, unitarian, in, later, years, he, joined, the, austin, texas, unitarian, universalist, congregation, and, was, an, active, participant, in, that, church, referring, to, the, ideas, such, as, thomas, oord, s, theocosmocentrism, 2010, the, soft, panentheism, of, open, theism, keith, ward, s, comparative, theology, and, john, polkinghorne, s, critical, realism, 2009, raymond, potgieter, observes, distinctions, such, as, dipolar, and, bipolar, the, former, suggests, two, poles, separated, such, as, god, influencing, creation, and, it, in, turn, its, creator, bangert, 2006, 168, whereas, bipolarity, completes, god, s, being, implying, interdependence, between, temporal, and, eternal, poles, marbaniang, 2011, 133, in, dealing, with, whitehead, s, approach, does, not, make, this, distinction, i, use, the, term, bipolar, as, a, generic, term, to, include, suggestions, of, the, structural, definition, of, god, s, transcendence, and, immanence, to, for, instance, accommodate, a, present, and, future, reality, into, which, deity, must, reasonably, fit, and, function, and, yet, maintain, separation, from, this, world, and, evil, whilst, remaining, within, it, some, argue, that, panentheism, should, also, include, the, notion, that, god, has, always, been, related, to, some, world, or, another, which, denies, the, idea, of, creation, out, of, nothing, creatio, ex, nihilo, nazarene, methodist, theologian, thomas, jay, oord, 1965, advocates, panentheism, but, he, uses, the, word, theocosmocentrism, to, highlight, the, notion, that, god, and, some, world, or, another, are, the, primary, conceptual, starting, blocks, for, eminently, fruitful, theology, this, form, of, panentheism, helps, in, overcoming, the, problem, of, evil, and, in, proposing, that, god, s, love, for, the, world, is, essential, to, who, god, is, the, latter, day, saint, movement, teaches, that, the, light, of, christ, proceeds, from, god, through, christ, and, gives, life, and, light, to, all, things, manichaeists, being, of, another, gnostic, sect, preached, a, very, different, doctrine, in, positioning, the, true, manichaean, god, against, matter, as, well, as, other, deities, that, it, described, as, enmeshed, with, the, world, namely, the, gods, of, jews, christians, and, pagans, nevertheless, this, dualistic, teaching, included, an, elaborate, cosmological, myth, that, narrates, the, defeat, of, primal, man, by, the, powers, of, darkness, that, devoured, and, imprisoned, the, particles, of, light, valentinian, gnosticism, taught, that, matter, came, about, through, emanations, of, the, supreme, being, even, if, to, some, this, event, is, held, to, be, more, accidental, than, intentional, to, other, gnostics, these, emanations, were, akin, to, the, sephirot, of, the, kabbalists, and, deliberate, manifestations, of, a, transcendent, god, through, a, complex, system, of, intermediaries, the, earliest, reference, to, panentheistic, thought, in, hindu, philosophy, is, in, a, creation, myth, contained, in, the, later, section, of, rig, veda, called, the, purusha, sukta, which, was, compiled, before, 1100, bce, the, purusha, sukta, gives, a, description, of, the, spiritual, unity, of, the, cosmos, it, presents, the, nature, of, purusha, or, the, cosmic, being, as, both, immanent, in, the, manifested, world, and, yet, transcendent, to, it, from, this, being, the, sukta, holds, the, original, creative, will, proceeds, by, which, this, vast, universe, is, projected, in, space, and, time, the, most, influential, and, dominant, school, of, indian, philosophy, advaita, vedanta, rejects, theism, and, dualism, by, insisting, that, brahman, is, without, parts, or, attributes, one, without, a, second, since, brahman, has, no, properties, contains, no, internal, diversity, and, is, identical, with, the, whole, reality, it, cannot, be, understood, as, an, anthropomorphic, personal, god, the, relationship, between, brahman, and, the, creation, is, often, thought, to, be, panentheistic, panentheism, is, also, expressed, in, the, bhagavad, gita, in, verse, ix, 4, krishna, states, by, me, all, this, universe, is, pervaded, through, my, unmanifested, form, all, beings, abide, in, me, but, i, do, not, abide, in, them, many, schools, of, hindu, thought, espouse, monistic, theism, which, is, thought, to, be, similar, to, a, panentheistic, viewpoint, nimbarka, s, school, of, differential, monism, dvaitadvaita, ramanuja, s, school, of, qualified, monism, vishistadvaita, and, saiva, siddhanta, and, kashmir, shaivism, are, all, considered, to, be, panentheistic, chaitanya, mahaprabhu, s, gaudiya, vaishnavism, which, elucidates, the, doctrine, of, achintya, bheda, abheda, inconceivable, oneness, and, difference, is, also, thought, to, be, panentheistic, in, kashmir, shaivism, all, things, are, believed, to, be, a, manifestation, of, universal, consciousness, cit, or, brahman, so, from, the, point, of, view, of, this, school, the, phenomenal, world, akti, is, real, and, it, exists, and, has, its, being, in, consciousness, it, thus, kashmir, shaivism, is, also, propounding, of, theistic, monism, or, panentheism, shaktism, or, tantra, is, regarded, as, an, indian, prototype, of, panentheism, shakti, is, considered, to, be, the, cosmos, itself, she, is, the, embodiment, of, energy, and, dynamism, and, the, motivating, force, behind, all, action, and, existence, in, the, material, universe, shiva, is, her, transcendent, masculine, aspect, providing, the, divine, ground, of, all, being, there, is, no, shiva, without, shakti, or, shakti, without, shiva, the, two, in, themselves, are, one, thus, it, is, she, who, becomes, the, time, and, space, the, cosmos, it, is, she, who, becomes, the, five, elements, and, thus, all, animate, life, and, inanimate, forms, she, is, the, primordial, energy, that, holds, all, creation, and, destruction, all, cycles, of, birth, and, death, all, laws, of, cause, and, effect, within, herself, and, yet, is, greater, than, the, sum, total, of, all, these, she, is, transcendent, but, becomes, immanent, as, the, cosmos, mula, prakriti, she, the, primordial, energy, directly, becomes, matter, while, mainstream, rabbinic, judaism, is, classically, monotheistic, and, follows, in, the, footsteps, of, maimonides, c, 1135, 1204, the, panentheistic, conception, of, god, can, be, found, among, certain, mystical, jewish, traditions, a, leading, scholar, of, kabbalah, moshe, idel, ascribes, this, doctrine, to, the, kabbalistic, system, of, moses, ben, jacob, cordovero, 1522, 1570, and, in, the, eighteenth, century, to, the, baal, shem, tov, c, 1700, 1760, founder, of, the, hasidic, movement, as, well, as, his, contemporaries, rabbi, dov, ber, the, maggid, of, mezeritch, died, 1772, and, menahem, mendel, the, maggid, of, bar, this, may, be, said, of, many, if, not, most, subsequent, hasidic, masters, there, is, some, debate, as, to, whether, isaac, luria, 1534, 1572, and, lurianic, kabbalah, with, its, doctrine, of, tzimtzum, can, be, regarded, as, panentheistic, according, to, hasidism, the, infinite, ein, sof, is, incorporeal, and, exists, in, a, state, that, is, both, transcendent, and, immanent, this, appears, to, be, the, view, of, non, hasidic, rabbi, chaim, of, volozhin, as, well, hasidic, judaism, merges, the, elite, ideal, of, nullification, to, a, transcendent, god, via, the, intellectual, articulation, of, inner, dimensions, through, kabbalah, and, with, emphasis, on, the, panentheistic, divine, immanence, in, everything, many, scholars, would, argue, that, panentheism, is, the, best, single, word, description, of, the, philosophical, theology, of, baruch, spinoza, it, is, therefore, no, surprise, that, aspects, of, panentheism, are, also, evident, in, the, theology, of, reconstructionist, judaism, as, presented, in, the, writings, of, mordecai, kaplan, 1881, 1983, who, was, strongly, influenced, by, spinoza, many, newer, contemporary, sikhs, have, suggested, that, human, souls, and, the, monotheistic, god, are, two, different, realities, dualism, distinguishing, it, from, the, monistic, and, various, shades, of, nondualistic, philosophies, of, other, indian, religions, however, sikh, scholars, have, explored, nondualist, exegesis, of, sikh, scriptures, such, as, bhai, vir, singh, according, to, mandair, vir, singh, interprets, the, sikh, scriptures, as, teaching, nonduality, the, renowned, sikh, scholar, bhai, mani, singh, is, quoted, to, saying, that, sikhism, has, all, the, essence, of, vedanta, philosophy, historically, the, sikh, symbol, of, ik, oankaar, has, had, a, monist, meaning, and, has, been, reduced, to, simply, meaning, there, is, but, one, god, which, is, incorrect, older, exegesis, of, sikh, scripture, such, as, the, faridkot, teeka, and, garab, ganjani, teeka, has, always, described, sikh, metaphysics, as, a, non, dual, panentheistic, universe, for, this, reason, sikh, metaphysics, has, often, been, compared, to, the, non, dual, vedanta, metaphysics, the, sikh, poet, bhai, nand, lal, often, used, sufi, terms, to, describe, sikh, philosophy, talking, about, wahdat, ul, wujud, in, his, persian, poetry, wahdat, ul, wujud, the, unity, of, all, things, is, a, concept, sometimes, described, as, pantheism, or, panentheistic, it, is, primarily, associated, with, the, asharite, sufi, scholar, ibn, arabi, some, sufi, orders, notably, the, bektashis, and, the, universal, sufi, movement, adhere, to, similar, panentheistic, beliefs, same, is, said, about, the, nizari, ismaili, who, follow, panentheism, according, to, ismaili, doctrine, the, mesoamerican, empires, of, the, mayas, aztecs, as, well, as, the, south, american, incas, tahuatinsuyu, have, typically, been, characterized, as, polytheistic, with, strong, male, and, female, deities, according, to, charles, c, mann, s, history, book, 1491, new, revelations, of, the, americas, before, columbus, only, the, lower, classes, of, aztec, society, were, polytheistic, philosopher, james, maffie, has, argued, that, aztec, metaphysics, was, pantheistic, rather, than, panentheistic, since, teotl, was, considered, by, aztec, philosophers, to, be, the, ultimate, all, encompassing, yet, all, transcending, force, defined, by, its, inherit, duality, native, american, beliefs, in, north, america, have, been, characterized, as, panentheistic, in, that, there, is, an, emphasis, on, a, single, unified, divine, spirit, that, is, manifest, in, each, individual, entity, north, american, native, writers, have, also, translated, the, word, for, god, as, the, great, mystery, or, as, the, sacred, other, this, concept, is, referred, to, by, many, as, the, great, spirit, philosopher, j, baird, callicott, has, described, lakota, theology, as, panentheistic, in, that, the, divine, both, transcends, and, is, immanent, in, everything, one, exception, can, be, modern, cherokee, who, are, predominantly, monotheistic, but, apparently, not, panentheistic, yet, in, older, cherokee, traditions, many, observe, both, aspects, of, pantheism, and, panentheism, and, are, often, not, beholden, to, exclusivity, encompassing, other, spiritual, traditions, without, contradiction, a, common, trait, among, some, tribes, in, the, americas, in, the, stories, of, keetoowah, storytellers, sequoyah, guess, and, dennis, sixkiller, god, is, known, as, commonly, pronounced, unehlanv, and, visited, earth, in, prehistoric, times, but, then, left, earth, and, her, people, to, rely, on, themselves, this, shows, a, parallel, to, vaishnava, cosmology, konkokyo, is, a, form, of, sectarian, japanese, shinto, and, a, faith, within, the, shinbutsu, sh, g, tradition, traditional, shintoism, holds, that, an, impersonal, spirit, manifests, penetrates, the, material, world, giving, all, objects, consciousness, and, spontaneously, creating, a, system, of, natural, mechanisms, forces, and, phenomena, musubi, konkokyo, deviates, from, traditional, shintoism, by, holding, that, this, spirit, comparable, to, brahman, has, a, personal, identity, and, mind, this, personal, form, is, non, different, from, the, energy, itself, not, residing, in, any, particular, cosmological, location, in, konkokyo, this, god, is, named, tenchi, kane, no, kami, sama, which, can, be, translated, directly, as, spirit, of, the, gilded, golden, heavens, and, earth, though, practitioners, of, konkokyo, are, small, in, number, 300, 000, globally, the, sect, has, birthed, or, influenced, a, multiplicity, of, japanese, new, religions, such, as, oomoto, many, of, these, faiths, carry, on, the, panentheistic, views, of, konkokyo
