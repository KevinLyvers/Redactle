u, 0fd8, left, facing, svasti, sign, with, dots, european, hypotheses, of, the, swastika, are, often, treated, in, conjunction, with, cross, symbols, in, general, such, as, the, sun, cross, of, bronze, age, religion, beyond, its, certain, presence, in, the, proto, writing, symbol, systems, such, as, the, vin, a, script, which, appeared, during, the, neolithic, according, to, ren, gu, non, the, swastika, represents, the, north, pole, and, the, rotational, movement, around, a, centre, or, immutable, axis, axis, mundi, and, only, secondly, it, represents, the, sun, as, a, reflected, function, of, the, north, pole, as, such, it, is, a, symbol, of, life, of, the, vivifying, role, of, the, supreme, principle, of, the, universe, the, absolute, god, in, relation, to, the, cosmic, order, it, represents, the, activity, the, hellenic, logos, the, hindu, om, the, chinese, taiyi, great, one, of, the, principle, of, the, universe, in, the, formation, of, the, world, according, to,

universe, including, the, letters, gamma, and, g, symbolising, the, great, architect, of, the, universe, of, masonic, thought, according, to, the, scholar, reza, assasi, the, swastika, represents, the, north, ecliptic, north, pole, centred, in, draconis, with, the, constellation, draco, as, one, of, its, beams, he, argues, that, this, symbol, was, later, attested, as, the, four, horse, chariot, of, mithra, in, ancient, iranian, culture, they, believed, the, cosmos, was, pulled, by, four, heavenly, horses, who, revolved, around, a, fixed, centre, in, a, clockwise, direction, he, suggests, that, this, notion, later, flourished, in, roman, mithraism, as, the, symbol, appears, in, mithraic, iconography, and, astronomical, representations, according, to, the, russian, archaeologist, gennady, zdanovich, who, studied, some, of, the, oldest, examples, of, the, symbol, in, sintashta, culture, the, swastika, symbolises, the, universe, representing, the, spinning, constellations, of, the, celestial, north, pole, centred, in, ursae, minoris, specifically, the, little, and, big, dipper, or, chariots, or, ursa, minor, and, ursa, major, likewise, according, to, ren, gu, non, the, swastika, is, drawn, by, visualising, the, big, dipper, great, bear, in, the, four, phases, of, revolution, around, the, pole, star, in, their, 1985, book, comet, carl, sagan, and, ann, druyan, argue, that, the, appearance, of, a, rotating, comet, with, a, four, pronged, tail, as, early, as, 2, 000, years, bce, could, explain, why, the, swastika, is, found, in, the, cultures, of, both, the, old, world, and, the, pre, columbian, americas, the, han, dynasty, book, of, silk, 2nd, century, bce, depicts, such, a, comet, with, a, swastika, like, symbol, bob, kobres, in, a, 1992, paper, contends, that, the, swastika, like, comet, on, the, han, dynasty, manuscript, was, labelled, a, long, tailed, pheasant, star, dixing, because, of, its, resemblance, to, a, bird, s, foot, or, footprint, similar, comparisons, had, been, made, by, j, f, hewitt, in, 1907, as, well, as, a, 1908, article, in, good, housekeeping, kobres, goes, on, to, suggest, an, association, of, mythological, birds, and, comets, also, outside, of, china, in, native, american, culture, particularly, among, the, pima, people, of, arizona, the, swastika, is, a, symbol, of, the, four, winds, anthropologist, frank, hamilton, cushing, noted, that, among, the, pima, the, symbol, of, the, four, winds, is, made, from, a, cross, with, the, four, curved, arms, similar, to, a, broken, sun, cross, and, concludes, the, right, angle, swastika, is, primarily, a, representation, of, the, circle, of, the, four, wind, gods, standing, at, the, head, of, their, trails, or, directions, the, earliest, known, swastikas, are, from, 10, 000, bce, part, of, an, intricate, meander, pattern, of, joined, up, swastikas, found, on, a, late, paleolithic, figurine, of, a, bird, carved, from, mammoth, ivory, found, in, mezine, ukraine, however, the, age, of, 10, 000, bce, is, a, conservative, estimate, and, the, true, age, may, be, as, old, as, 17, 000, bce, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, swastika, may, be, a, stylised, picture, of, a, stork, in, flight, as, the, carving, was, found, near, phallic, objects, this, may, also, support, the, idea, that, the, pattern, was, a, fertility, symbol, in, the,

decorated, with, swastikas, 101, 105, 31, 31, hearing, of, this, the, director, of, the, french, school, at, athens, mile, louis, burnouf, wrote, to, schliemann, in, 1872, stating, the, swastika, should, be, regarded, as, a, sign, of, the, aryan, race, burnouf, told, schliemann, that, it, should, also, be, noted, that, the, jews, have, completely, rejected, it, 89, accordingly, schliemann, believed, the, trojans, to, have, been, aryans, the, primitive, trojans, therefore, belonged, to, the, aryan, race, which, is, further, sufficiently, proved, by, the, symbols, on, the, round, terra, cottas, 157, 90, schliemann, accepted, burnouf, s, interpretation, 89, this, winter, i, have, read, in, athens, many, excellent, works, of, celebrated, scholars, on, indian, antiquities, especially, adalbert, kuhn, die, herakunft, des, feuers, max, m, ller, s, essays, mile, burnouf, la, science, des, religions, and, essai, sur, le, v, da, as, well, as, several, works, by, eug, ne, burnouf, and, i, now, perceive, that, these, crosses, upon, the, trojan, terra, cottas, are, of, the, highest, importance, to, arch, ology, schliemann, believed, that, use, of, the, swastika, spread, widely, across, eurasia, i, am, now, able, to, prove, that, the, which, i, find, in, mile, burnouf, s, sanscrit, lexicon, under, the, name, of, suastika, and, with, the, meaning, or, as, the, sign, of, good, wishes, were, already, regarded, thousands, of, years, before, christ, as, religious, symbols, of, the, very, greatest, importance, among, the, early, progenitors, of, the, aryan, races, in, bactria, and, in, the, villages, of, the, oxus, at, a, time, when, germans, indians, pelasgians, celts, persians, slavonians, and, iranians, still, formed, one, nation, and, spoke, one, language, schliemann, established, a, link, between, the, swastika, and, germany, he, connected, objects, he, excavated, at, troy, to, objects, bearing, swastikas, found, in, germany, near, k, nigswalde, on, the, oder, 31, 31, 90, for, i, recognise, at, the, first, glance, the, suastika, upon, one, of, those, three, pot, bottoms, which, were, discovered, on, bishop, s, island, near, k, nigswalde, on, the, right, bank, of, the, oder, and, have, given, rise, to, very, many, learned, discussions, while, no, one, recognised, the, mark, as, that, exceedingly, significant, religious, symbol, of, our, remote, ancestors, sarah, boxer, in, an, article, in, 2000, in, the, new, york, times, described, this, as, a, fateful, link, according, to, steven, heller, schliemann, presumed, that, the, swastika, was, a, religious, symbol, of, his, german, ancestors, which, linked, ancient, teutons, homeric, greeks, and, vedic, india, 31, according, to, bernard, mees, of, all, of, the, pre, runic, symbols, the, swastika, has, always, been, the, most, popular, among, scholars, and, the, origin, of, swastika, studies, must, be, traced, to, the, excitement, generated, by, the, archaeological, finds, of, heinrich, schliemann, at, troy, after, his, excavations, at, troy, schliemann, began, digging, at, mycenae, according, to, cathy, gere, having, burdened, the, swastika, symbol, with, such, cultural, religious, and, racial, significance, in, troy, and, its, remains, it, was, incumbent, on, schliemann, to, find, the, symbol, repeated, at, mycenae, but, its, occurrence, turned, out, to, be, disappointingly, infrequent, 91, gere, writes, that, he, did, his, best, with, what, he, had, 91, the, cross, with, the, marks, of, four, nails, may, often, be, seen, as, well, as, the, which, is, usually, also, represented, with, four, points, indicating, the, four, nails, thus, these, signs, cannot, but, represent, the, suastika, formed, by, two, pieces, of, wood, which, were, laid, across, and, fixed, with, four, nails, and, in, the, joint, of, which, the, holy, fire, was, produced, by, friction, by, a, third, piece, of, wood, but, both, the, cross, and, the, occur, for, the, most, part, only, on, the, vases, with, geometrical, patterns, gere, points, out, that, although, schliemann, wrote, that, the, motif, may, often, be, seen, his, 1878, book, mycen, did, not, have, illustrations, of, any, examples, 91, schliemann, described, a, small, and, thick, terra, cotta, disk, on, which, are, engraved, a, number, of, s, the, sign, which, occurs, so, frequently, in, the, ruins, of, troy, but, as, gere, notes, he, did, not, publish, an, illustration, 77, 91, among, the, gold, grave, goods, at, grave, circles, a, and, b, was, a, repouss, roundel, in, grave, iii, of, grave, circle, a, the, ornamentation, of, which, schliemann, thought, was, derived, from, the, swastika, the, curious, ornamentation, in, the, centre, which, so, often, recurs, here, seems, to, me, to, be, derived, from, the, the, more, so, as, the, points, which, are, thought, to, be, the, marks, of, the, nails, are, seldom, missing, the, artist, has, only, added, two, more, arms, and, curved, all, of, them, according, to, gere, this, motif, is, completely, dissimilar, to, the, swastika, and, that, schliemann, was, straining, desperately, after, the, same, connection, 91, nevertheless, the, mycenaean, greeks, and, the, trojan, people, both, came, to, be, identified, as, representatives, of, the, aryan, race, despite, the, difficulties, with, linking, the, symbolism, of, troy, and, mycenae, the, common, aryan, roots, of, the, two, peoples, became, something, of, a, truism, 91, the, house, schliemann, had, had, built, in, panepistimiou, street, in, athens, by, 1880, iliou, melathron, is, decorated, with, swastika,

interpreted, by, purchasers, as, bearing, a, nazi, symbol, this, has, resulted, in, several, such, products, having, been, boycotted, or, pulled, from, shelves, when, a, ten, year, old, boy, in,

pendant, from, its, website, after, receiving, backlash, on, social, media, the, retailer, apologized, for, the, lack, of, sensitivity, but, noted, that, the, swastika, was, a, buddhist, symbol, beginning, in, the, early, 2000s, partially, as, a, reaction, to, the, publication, of, a, book, titled, the, swastika, symbol, beyond, redemption, by, steven, heller, there, has, been, a, movement, by, hindu, buddhist, indigenous, peoples, jain, historians, anthropologists, linguists, and, other, scholars, to, reclaim, what, was, seen, as, their, swastika, symbol, until, hitler, stole, it, these, groups, argue, that, the, swastika, is, distinct, from, the, nazi, symbol, a, key, part, of, this, argument, rests, on, the, fact, that, adolf, hitler, writing, in, german, referred, to, the, symbol, as, a, hooked, cross, german, hakenkreuz, the, main, barrier, to, the, effort, to, reclaim, restore, or, reassess, the, swastika, comes, from, the, decades, of, extremely, negative, association, in, the, western, world, following, the, nazi, party, s, adoption, of, it, in, the, 1930s, as, well, white, supremacist, groups, still, cling, to, the, symbol, as, an, icon, of, power, and, identity, many, media, organizations, in, the, west, also, continue, to, describe, neo, nazi, usage, of, the, symbol, as, a, swastika, or, sometimes, with, the, nazi, adjective, written, as, nazi, swastika, groups, that, oppose, this, media, terminology, do, not, wish, to, censor, such, usage, but, rather, to, shift, coverage, of, antisemitic, and, hateful, events, to, describe, the, symbol, in, this, context, as, a, hakenkreuz, or, hooked, cross, the, flag, of, the, guna, people, also, kuna, yala, or, guna, yala, of, panama, this, flag, adopted, in, 1925, has, a, swastika, symbol, that, they, call, naa, ukuryaa, according, to, one, explanation, this, ancestral, symbol, symbolises, the, octopus, that, created, the, world, its, tentacles, pointing, to, the, four, cardinal, points, besides, its, use, as, a, religious, symbol, in, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, which, can, be, traced, back, to, pre, modern, traditions, the, swastika, is, also, used, by, adherents, of, a, large, number, of, new, religious, movements, which, were, established, in, the, modern, period, in, the, 1880s, the, u, s, origined, theosophical, society, adopted, a, swastika, as, part, of, its, seal, along, with, an, om, a, hexagram, or, star, of, david, an, ankh, and, an, ouroboros, unlike, the, much, more, recent, ra, lian, movement, the, theosophical, society, symbol, has, been, free, from, controversy, and, the, seal, is, still, used, the, current, seal, also, includes, the, text, there, is, no, religion, higher, than, truth, the, ra, lian, movement, whose, adherents, believe, extraterrestrials, created, all, life, on, earth, use, a, symbol, that, is, often, the, source, of, considerable, controversy, an, interlaced, star, of, david, and, a, swastika, the, ra, lians, say, the, star, of, david, represents, infinity, in, space, whereas, the, swastika, represents, infinity, in, time, no, beginning, and, no, end, in, time, and, everything, being, cyclic, in,
