humanity, which, had, separated, itself, from, god, through, sin, see, the, concept, of, original, sin, according, to, a, view, that, has, featured, prominently, in, western, theology, since, early, in, the, 2nd, millennium, god, s, justice, required, an, atonement, for, sin, from, humanity, if, human, beings, were, to, be, restored, to, their, place, in, creation, and, saved, from, damnation, however, god, knew, limited, human, beings, could, not, make, sufficient, atonement, for, humanity, s, offense, to, god, was, infinite, so, god, created, a, covenant, with, abraham, which, he, fulfilled, when, he, sent, his, only, son, to, become, the, sacrifice, for, the, broken, covenant, according, to, this, theology, christ, s, sacrifice, replaced, the, insufficient, animal, sacrifice, of, the, old, covenant, christ, the, lamb, of, god, replaced, the, lambs, sacrifice, of, the, ancient, korban, todah, the, rite, of, thanksgiving, chief, of, which, is, the, passover, in, the, mosaic, law, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, the, lutheran, churches, the, methodist, churches, and, the, irvingian, churches, the, eucharist, or, mass, as, well, as, the, divine, liturgy, of, the, eastern, catholic, churches, and, eastern, orthodox, church, is, seen, as, a, sacrifice, among, the, anglicans, the, words, of, the, liturgy, make, explicit, that, the, eucharist, is, a, sacrifice, of, praise, and, thanksgiving, and, is, a, material, offering, to, god, in, union, with, christ, using, such, words, as, with, these, thy, holy, gifts, which, we, now, offer, unto, thee, 1789, bcp, or, presenting, to, you, from, the, gifts, you, have, given, us, we, offer, you, these, gifts, prayer, d, bcp, 1976, as, clearly, evidenced, in, the, revised, books, of, common, prayer, from, 1789, in, which, the, theology, of, eucharist, was, moved, closer, to, the, catholic, position, likewise, the, united, methodist, church, in, its, eucharistic, liturgy, contains, the, words, let, us, offer, ourselves, and, our, gifts, to, god, a, service, of, word, and, table, i, the, united, methodist, church, officially, teaches, that, holy, communion, is, a, type, of, sacrifice, that, re, presents, rather, than, repeats, the, sacrifice, of, christ, on, the, cross, she, further, proclaims, that, we, also, present, ourselves, as, sacrifice, in, union, with, christ, romans, 12, 1, 1, peter, 2, 5, to, be, used, by, god, in, the, work, of, redemption, reconciliation, and, justice, in, the, great, thanksgiving, the, church, prays, we, offer, ourselves, in, praise, and, thanksgiving, as, a, holy, and, living, sacrifice, in, union, with, christ, s, offering, for, us, umh, page, 10, a, formal, statement, by, the, usccb, affirms, that, methodists, and, catholics, agree, that, the, sacrificial, language, of, the, eucharistic, celebration, refers, to, the, sacrifice, of, christ, once, for, all, to, our, pleading, of, that, sacrifice, here, and, now, to, our, offering, of, the, sacrifice, of, praise, and, thanksgiving, and, to, our, sacrifice, of, ourselves, in, union, with, christ, who, offered, himself, to, the, father, roman, catholic, theology, speaks, of, the, eucharist, not, being, a, separate, or, additional, sacrifice, to, that, of, christ, on, the, cross, it, is, rather, exactly, the, same, sacrifice, which, transcends, time, and, space, the, lamb, slain, from, the, foundation, of, the, world, rev, 13, 8, renewed, and, made, present, the, only, distinction, being, that, it, is, offered, in, an, unbloody, manner, the, sacrifice, is, made, present, without, christ, dying, or, being, crucified, again, it, is, a, re, presentation, of, the, once, and, for, all, sacrifice, of, calvary, by, the, now, risen, christ, who, continues, to, offer, himself, and, what, he, has, done, on, the, cross, as, an, oblation, to, the, father, the, complete, identification, of, the, mass, with, the, sacrifice, of, the, cross, is, found, in, christ, s, words, at, the, last, supper, over, the, bread, and, wine, this, is, my, body, which, is, given, up, for, you, and, this, is, my, blood, of, the, new, covenant, which, is, shed, unto, the, forgiveness, of, sins, the, bread, and, wine, offered, by, melchizedek, in, sacrifice, in, the, old, covenant, genesis, 14, 18, psalm, 110, 4, are, transformed, through, the, mass, into, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, see, transubstantiation, note, the, orthodox, church, and, methodist, church, do, not, hold, as, dogma, as, do, catholics, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, preferring, rather, to, not, make, an, assertion, regarding, the, how, of, the, sacraments, and, the, offering, becomes, one, with, that, of, christ, on, the, cross, in, the, mass, as, on, the, cross, christ, is, both, priest, offering, the, sacrifice, and, victim, the, sacrifice, he, offers, is, himself, though, in, the, mass, in, the, former, capacity, he, works, through, a, solely, human, priest, who, is, joined, to, him, through, the, sacrament, of, holy, orders, and, thus, shares, in, christ, s, priesthood, as, do, all, who, are, baptized, into, the, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, the, christ, through, the, mass, the, effects, of, the, one, sacrifice, of, the, cross, can, be, understood, as, working, toward, the, redemption, of, those, present, for, their, specific, intentions, and, prayers, and, to, assisting, the, souls, in, purgatory, for, catholics, the, theology, of, sacrifice, has, seen, considerable, change, as, the, result, of, historical, and, scriptural, studies, for, lutherans, the, eucharist, is, a, sacrifice, of, thanksgiving, and, praise, in, that, by, giving, thanks, a, person, acknowledges, that, he, or, she, is, in, need, of, the, gift, and, that, his, or, her, situation, will, change, only, by, receiving, the, gift, the, irvingian, churches, teach, the, real, presence, of, the, sacrifice, of, jesus, christ, in, holy, communion, in, holy, communion, it, is, not, only, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, but, also, his, sacrifice, itself, that, are, truly, present, however, this, sacrifice, has, only, been, brought, once, and, is, not, repeated, in, holy, communion, neither, is, holy, communion, merely, a, reminder, of, the, sacrifice, rather, during, the, celebration, of, holy, communion, jesus, christ, is, in, the, midst, of, the, congregation, as, the, crucified, risen, and, returning, lord, thus, his, once, brought, sacrifice, is, also, present, in, that, its, effect, grants, the, individual, access, to, salvation, in, this, way, the, celebration, of, holy, communion, causes, the, partakers, to, repeatedly, envision, the, sacrificial, death, of, the, lord, which, enables, them, to, proclaim, it, with, conviction, 1, corinthians, 11, 26, 8, 2, 13, the, catechism, of, the, new, apostolic, church, the, concept, of, self, sacrifice, and, martyrs, are, central, to, christianity, often, found, in, roman, catholicism, is, the, idea, of, joining, one, s, own, life, and, sufferings, to, the, sacrifice, of, christ, on, the, cross, thus, one, can, offer, up, involuntary, suffering, such, as, illness, or, purposefully, embrace, suffering, in, acts, of, penance, some, protestants, criticize, this, as, a, denial, of, the, all, sufficiency, of, christ, s, sacrifice, but, according, to, roman, catholic, interpretation, it, finds, support, in, st, paul, now, i, rejoice, in, my, sufferings, for, your, sake, and, in, my, flesh, i, complete, what, is, lacking, in, christ, s, afflictions, for, the, sake, of, his, body, that, is, the, church, col, 1, 24, pope, john, paul, ii, explained, in, his, apostolic, letter, salvifici, doloris, 11, february, 1984, in, the, cross, of, christ, not, only, is, the, redemption, accomplished, through, suffering, but, also, human, suffering, itself, has, been, redeemed, every, man, has, his, own, share, in, the, redemption, each, one, is, also, called, to, share, in, that, suffering, through, which, the, redemption, was, accomplished, in, bringing, about, the, redemption, through, suffering, christ, has, also, raised, human, suffering, to, the, level, of, the, redemption, thus, each, man, in, his, suffering, can, also, become, a, sharer, in, the, redemptive, suffering, of, christ, the, sufferings, of, christ, created, the, good, of, the, world, s, redemption, this, good, in, itself, is, inexhaustible, and, infinite, no, man, can, add, anything, to, it, but, at, the, same, time, in, the, mystery, of, the, church, as, his, body, christ, has, in, a, sense, opened, his, own, redemptive, suffering, to, all, human, suffering, salvifici, doloris, 19, 24, some, christians, reject, the, idea, of, the, eucharist, as, a, sacrifice, inclining, to, see, it, as, merely, a, holy, meal, even, if, they, believe, in, a, form, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, bread, and, wine, as, reformed, christians, do, the, more, recent, the, origin, of, a, particular, tradition, the, less, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, sacrificial, nature, of, the, eucharist, the, roman, catholic, response, is, that, the, sacrifice, of, the, mass, in, the, new, covenant, is, that, one, sacrifice, for, sins, on, the, cross, which, transcends, time, offered, in, an, unbloody, manner, as, discussed, above, and, that, christ, is, the, real, priest, at, every, mass, working, through, mere, human, beings, to, whom, he, has, granted, the, grace, of, a, share, in, his, priesthood, as, priest, carries, connotations, of, one, who, offers, sacrifice, some, protestants, with, the, exception, of, lutherans, and, anglicans, usually, do, not, use, it, for, their, clergy, evangelical, protestantism, emphasizes, the, importance, of, a, decision, to, accept, christ, s, sacrifice, on, the, cross, consciously, and, personally, as, atonement, for, one, s, individual, sins, if, one, is, to, be, saved, this, is, known, as, accepting, christ, as, one, s, personal, lord, and, savior, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, see, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, as, a, continuation, rather, than, a, reenactment, of, the, last, supper, as, fr, john, matusiak, of, the, oca, says, the, liturgy, is, not, so, much, a, reenactment, of, the, mystical, supper, or, these, events, as, it, is, a, continuation, of, these, events, which, are, beyond, time, and, space, the, orthodox, also, see, the, eucharistic, liturgy, as, a, bloodless, sacrifice, during, which, the, bread, and, wine, we, offer, to, god, become, the, body, and, blood, of, jesus, christ, through, the, descent, and, operation, of, the, holy, spirit, who, effects, the, change, this, view, is, witnessed, to, by, the, prayers, of, the, divine, liturgy, of, st, john, chrysostom, when, the, priest, says, accept, o, god, our, supplications, make, us, to, be, worthy, to, offer, unto, thee, supplications, and, prayers, and, bloodless, sacrifices, for, all, thy, people, and, remembering, this, saving, commandment, and, all, those, things, which, came, to, pass, for, us, the, cross, the, grave, the, resurrection, on, the, third, day, the, ascension, into, heaven, the, sitting, down, at, the, right, hand, the, second, and, glorious, coming, again, thine, own, of, thine, own, we, offer, unto, thee, on, behalf, of, all, and, for, all, and, thou, didst, become, man, and, didst, take, the, name, of, our, high, priest, and, deliver, unto, us, the, priestly, rite, of, this, liturgical, and, bloodless, sacrifice, the, modern, practice, of, hindu, animal, sacrifice, is, mostly, associated, with, shaktism, and, in, currents, of, folk, hinduism, strongly, rooted, in, local, popular, or, tribal, traditions, animal, sacrifices, were, part, of, the, ancient, vedic, religion, in, india, and, are, mentioned, in, scriptures, such, as, the, yajurveda, some, puranas, forbid, animal, sacrifice, an, animal, sacrifice, in, arabic, is, called, abi, a, or, qurban, the, term, may, have, roots, from, the, jewish, term, korban, in, some, places, like, bangladesh, india, or, pakistan, qurbani, is, always, used, for, islamic, animal, sacrifice, in, the, islamic, context, an, animal, sacrifice, referred, to, as, abi, a, meaning, sacrifice, as, a, ritual, is, offered, only, in, eid, ul, adha, the, sacrificial, animal, may, be, a, sheep, a, goat, a, camel, or, a, cow, the, animal, must, be, healthy, and, conscious, therefore, to, the, lord, turn, in, prayer, and, sacrifice, quran, 108, 2, qurban, is, an, islamic, prescription, for, the, affluent, to, share, their, good, fortune, with, the, needy, in, the, community, on, the, occasion, of, eid, ul, adha, festival, of, sacrifice, affluent, muslims, all, over, the, world, perform, the, sunnah, of, prophet, ibrahim, abraham, by, sacrificing, a, cow, or, sheep, the, meat, is, then, divided, into, three, equal, parts, one, part, is, retained, by, the, person, who, performs, the, sacrifice, the, second, is, given, to, his, relatives, the, third, part, is, distributed, to, the, poor, the, quran, states, that, the, sacrifice, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, blood, and, gore, quran, 22, 37, it, is, not, their, meat, nor, their, blood, that, reaches, god, it, is, your, piety, that, reaches, him, rather, it, is, done, to, help, the, poor, and, in, remembrance, of, abraham, s, willingness, to, sacrifice, his, son, ismael, at, god, s, command, the, urdu, and, persian, word, qurbani, comes, from, the, arabic, word, qurban, it, suggests, that, associate, act, performed, to, hunt, distance, to, almighty, god, and, to, hunt, his, sensible, pleasure, originally, the, word, qurban, enclosed, all, acts, of, charity, as, a, result, of, the, aim, of, charity, is, nothing, however, to, hunt, allah, s, pleasure, but, in, precise, non, secular, nomenclature, the, word, was, later, confined, to, the, sacrifice, of, associate, animal, slaughtered, for, the, sake, of, allah, a, similar, symbology, which, is, a, reflection, of, abraham, and, ismael, s, dilemma, is, the, stoning, of, the, jamaraat, which, takes, place, during, the, pilgrimage, ritual, sacrifice, was, practiced, in, ancient, israel, with, the, opening, chapters, of, the, book, leviticus, detailing, parts, of, an, overview, referring, to, the, exact, methods, of, bringing, sacrifices, although, sacrifices, could, include, bloodless, offerings, grain, and, wine, the, most, important, were, animal, sacrifices, blood, sacrifices, were, divided, into, burnt, offerings, hebrew, in, which, the, whole, unmaimed, animal, was, burnt, guilt, offerings, in, which, part, was, burnt, and, part, left, for, the, priest, and, peace, offerings, in, which, similarly, only, part, of, the, undamaged, animal, was, burnt, and, the, rest, eaten, in, ritually, pure, conditions, after, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, ritual, sacrifice, ceased, except, among, the, samaritans, maimonides, a, medieval, jewish, rationalist, argued, that, god, always, held, sacrifice, inferior, to, prayer, and, philosophical, meditation, however, god, understood, that, the, israelites, were, used, to, the, animal, sacrifices, that, the, surrounding, pagan, tribes, used, as, the, primary, way, to, commune, with, their, gods, as, such, in, maimonides, view, it, was, only, natural, that, israelites, would, believe, that, sacrifice, was, a, necessary, part, of, the, relationship, between, god, and, man, maimonides, concludes, that, god, s, decision, to, allow, sacrifices, was, a, concession, to, human, psychological, limitations, it, would, have, been, too, much, to, have, expected, the, israelites, to, leap, from, pagan, worship, to, prayer, and, meditation, in, one, step, in, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, he, writes, in, contrast, many, others, such, as, nachmanides, in, his, torah, commentary, on, leviticus, 1, 9, disagreed, contending, that, sacrifices, are, an, ideal, in, judaism, completely, central, the, teachings, of, the, torah, and, tanakh, reveal, the, israelites, s, familiarity, with, human, sacrifices, as, exemplified, by, the, near, sacrifice, of, isaac, by, his, father, abraham, genesis, 22, 1, 24, and, some, believe, the, actual, sacrifice, of, jephthah, s, daughter, judges, 11, 31, 40, while, many, believe, that, jephthah, s, daughter, was, committed, for, life, in, service, equivalent, to, a, nunnery, of, the, day, as, indicated, by, her, lament, over, her, weep, for, my, virginity, and, never, having, known, a, man, v37, the, king, of, moab, gives, his, firstborn, son, and, heir, as, a, whole, burnt, offering, albeit, to, the, pagan, god, chemosh, in, the, book, of, micah, one, asks, shall, i, give, my, firstborn, for, my, sin, the, fruit, of, my, body, for, the, sin, of, my, soul, micah, 6, 7, and, receives, a, response, it, hath, been, told, thee, o, man, what, is, good, and, what, the, lord, doth, require, of, thee, only, to, do, justly, and, to, love, mercy, and, to, walk, humbly, with, thy, god, micah, 6, 8, abhorrence, of, the, practice, of, child, sacrifice, is, emphasized, by, jeremiah, see, jeremiah, 7, 30, 32
