https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism
monism, attributes, oneness, or, singleness, greek, to, a, concept, such, as, to, existence, various, kinds, of, monism, can, be, distinguished, there, are, two, sorts, of, definitions, for, monism, although, the, term, monism, is, derived, from, western, philosophy, to, typify, positions, in, the, mind, body, problem, it, has, also, been, used, to, typify, religious, traditions, in, modern, hinduism, the, term, absolute, monism, has, been, applied, to, advaita, vedanta, though, philip, renard, points, out, that, this, may, be, a, western, interpretation, bypassing, the, intuitive, understanding, of, a, nondual, reality, it, is, more, generally, categorized, by, scholars, as, a, form, of, absolute, nondualism, material, monism, can, be, traced, back, to, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, who, sought, to, understand, the, arche, or, basic, principle, of, the, universe, in, terms, of, different, material, causes, these, included, thales, who, argued, that, the, basis, of, everything, was, water, anaximenes, who, claimed, it, was, air, and, heraclitus, who, believed, it, to, be, fire, later, parmenides, described, the, world, as, one, which, could, not, change, in, any, way, zeno, of, elea, defended, this, view, of, everything, being, a, single, entity, through, his, paradoxes, which, aim, to, show, the, existence, of, time, motion, and, space, to, be, illusionary, baruch, spinoza, argued, that, god, or, nature, deus, sive, natura, is, the, only, substance, of, the, universe, which, can, be, referred, to, as, either, god, or, nature, the, two, being, interchangeable, this, is, because, god, nature, has, all, the, possible, attributes, and, no, two, substances, can, share, an, attribute, which, means, there, can, be, no, other, substances, than, god, nature, monism, has, been, discussed, thoroughly, in, indian, philosophy, and, vedanta, throughout, their, history, starting, as, early, as, the, rig, veda, the, term, monism, was, introduced, in, the, 18th, century, by, christian, von, wolff, in, his, work, logic, 1728, to, designate, types, of, philosophical, thought, in, which, the, attempt, was, made, to, eliminate, the, dichotomy, of, body, and, mind, and, explain, all, phenomena, by, one, unifying, principle, or, as, manifestations, of, a, single, substance, the, mind, body, problem, in, philosophy, examines, the, relationship, between, mind, and, matter, and, in, particular, the, relationship, between, consciousness, and, the, brain, the, problem, was, addressed, by, ren, descartes, in, the, 17th, century, resulting, in, cartesian, dualism, and, by, pre, aristotelian, philosophers, in, avicennian, philosophy, and, in, earlier, asian, and, more, specifically, indian, traditions, it, was, later, also, applied, to, the, theory, of, absolute, identity, set, forth, by, hegel, and, schelling, thereafter, the, term, was, more, broadly, used, for, any, theory, postulating, a, unifying, principle, the, opponent, thesis, of, dualism, also, was, broadened, to, include, pluralism, according, to, urmson, as, a, result, of, this, extended, use, the, term, is, systematically, ambiguous, according, to, jonathan, schaffer, monism, lost, popularity, due, to, the, emergence, of, analytic, philosophy, in, the, early, twentieth, century, which, revolted, against, the, neo, hegelians, rudolf, carnap, and, a, j, ayer, who, were, strong, proponents, of, positivism, ridiculed, the, whole, question, as, incoherent, mysticism, the, mind, body, problem, has, reemerged, in, social, psychology, and, related, fields, with, the, interest, in, mind, body, interaction, and, the, rejection, of, cartesian, mind, body, dualism, in, the, identity, thesis, a, modern, form, of, monism, monism, is, also, still, relevant, to, the, philosophy, of, mind, where, various, positions, are, defended, different, types, of, monism, include, views, contrasting, with, monism, are, monism, in, modern, philosophy, of, mind, can, be, divided, into, three, broad, categories, certain, positions, do, not, fit, easily, into, the, above, categories, such, as, functionalism, anomalous, monism, and, reflexive, monism, moreover, they, do, not, define, the, meaning, of, real, while, the, lack, of, information, makes, it, difficult, in, some, cases, to, be, sure, of, the, details, the, following, pre, socratic, philosophers, thought, in, monistic, terms, pantheism, is, the, belief, that, everything, composes, an, all, encompassing, immanent, god, or, that, the, universe, or, nature, is, identical, with, divinity, pantheists, thus, do, not, believe, in, a, personal, or, anthropomorphic, god, but, believe, that, interpretations, of, the, term, differ, pantheism, was, popularized, in, the, modern, era, as, both, a, theology, and, philosophy, based, on, the, work, of, the, 17th, century, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, whose, ethics, was, an, answer, to, descartes, famous, dualist, theory, that, the, body, and, spirit, are, separate, spinoza, held, that, the, two, are, the, same, and, this, monism, is, a, fundamental, quality, of, his, philosophy, he, was, described, as, a, god, intoxicated, man, and, used, the, word, god, to, describe, the, unity, of, all, substance, although, the, term, pantheism, was, not, coined, until, after, his, death, spinoza, is, regarded, as, its, most, celebrated, advocate, h, p, owen, claimed, that, pantheists, are, monists, they, believe, that, there, is, only, one, being, and, that, all, other, forms, of, reality, are, either, modes, or, appearances, of, it, or, identical, with, it, pantheism, is, closely, related, to, monism, as, pantheists, too, believe, all, of, reality, is, one, substance, called, universe, god, or, nature, panentheism, a, slightly, different, concept, explained, below, however, is, dualistic, some, of, the, most, famous, pantheists, are, the, stoics, giordano, bruno, and, spinoza, panentheism, from, greek, p, n, all, en, in, and, the, s, god, all, in, god, is, a, belief, system, that, posits, that, the, divine, be, it, a, monotheistic, god, polytheistic, gods, or, an, eternal, cosmic, animating, force, interpenetrates, every, part, of, nature, but, is, not, one, with, nature, panentheism, differentiates, itself, from, pantheism, which, holds, that, the, divine, is, synonymous, with, the, universe, in, panentheism, there, are, two, types, of, substance, pan, the, universe, and, god, the, universe, and, the, divine, are, not, ontologically, equivalent, god, is, viewed, as, the, eternal, animating, force, within, the, universe, in, some, forms, of, panentheism, the, cosmos, exists, within, god, who, in, turn, transcends, pervades, or, is, in, the, cosmos, while, pantheism, asserts, that, all, is, god, panentheism, claims, that, god, animates, all, of, the, universe, and, also, transcends, the, universe, in, addition, some, forms, indicate, that, the, universe, is, contained, within, god, like, in, the, judaic, concept, of, tzimtzum, much, hindu, thought, is, highly, characterized, by, panentheism, and, pantheism, paul, tillich, has, argued, for, such, a, concept, within, christian, theology, as, has, liberal, biblical, scholar, marcus, borg, and, mystical, theologian, matthew, fox, an, episcopal, priest, pandeism, or, pan, deism, from, ancient, greek, romanized, pan, lit, all, and, latin, deus, meaning, god, in, the, sense, of, deism, is, a, term, describing, beliefs, coherently, incorporating, or, mixing, logically, reconcilable, elements, of, pantheism, that, god, or, a, metaphysically, equivalent, creator, deity, is, identical, to, nature, and, classical, deism, that, the, creator, god, who, designed, the, universe, no, longer, exists, in, a, status, where, it, can, be, reached, and, can, instead, be, confirmed, only, by, reason, it, is, therefore, most, particularly, the, belief, that, the, creator, of, the, universe, actually, became, the, universe, and, so, ceased, to, exist, as, a, separate, entity, through, this, synergy, pandeism, claims, to, answer, primary, objections, to, deism, why, would, god, create, and, then, not, interact, with, the, universe, and, to, pantheism, how, did, the, universe, originate, and, what, is, its, purpose, the, central, problem, in, asian, religious, philosophy, is, not, the, body, mind, problem, but, the, search, for, an, unchanging, real, or, absolute, beyond, the, world, of, appearances, and, changing, phenomena, and, the, search, for, liberation, from, dukkha, and, the, liberation, from, the, cycle, of, rebirth, in, hinduism, substance, ontology, prevails, seeing, brahman, as, the, unchanging, real, beyond, the, world, of, appearances, in, buddhism, process, ontology, is, prevalent, seeing, reality, as, empty, of, an, unchanging, essence, characteristic, for, various, asian, philosophy, technology, and, religions, is, the, discernment, of, levels, of, truth, an, emphasis, on, intuitive, experiential, understanding, of, the, absolute, such, as, jnana, bodhi, and, jianxing, chinese, and, the, technology, of, yin, and, yang, used, within, east, asian, medicine, with, an, emphasis, on, the, integration, of, these, levels, of, truth, and, its, understanding, vedanta, is, the, inquiry, into, and, systematisation, of, the, vedas, and, upanishads, to, harmonise, the, various, and, contrasting, ideas, that, can, be, found, in, those, texts, within, vedanta, different, schools, exist, the, colonisation, of, india, by, the, british, had, a, major, impact, on, hindu, society, in, response, leading, hindu, intellectuals, started, to, study, western, culture, and, philosophy, integrating, several, western, notions, into, hinduism, this, modernised, hinduism, at, its, turn, has, gained, popularity, in, the, west, a, major, role, was, played, in, the, 19th, century, by, swami, vivekananda, in, the, revival, of, hinduism, and, the, spread, of, advaita, vedanta, to, the, west, via, the, ramakrishna, mission, his, interpretation, of, advaita, vedanta, has, been, called, neo, vedanta, in, advaita, shankara, suggests, meditation, and, nirvikalpa, samadhi, are, means, to, gain, knowledge, of, the, already, existing, unity, of, brahman, and, atman, not, the, highest, goal, itself, oga, is, a, meditative, exercise, of, withdrawal, from, the, particular, and, identification, with, the, universal, leading, to, contemplation, of, oneself, as, the, most, universal, namely, consciousness, this, approach, is, different, from, the, classical, yoga, of, complete, thought, suppression, vivekananda, according, to, gavin, flood, was, a, figure, of, great, importance, in, the, development, of, a, modern, hindu, self, understanding, and, in, formulating, the, west, s, view, of, hinduism, central, to, his, philosophy, is, the, idea, that, the, divine, exists, in, all, beings, that, all, human, beings, can, achieve, union, with, this, innate, divinity, and, that, seeing, this, divine, as, the, essence, of, others, will, further, love, and, social, harmony, according, to, vivekananda, there, is, an, essential, unity, to, hinduism, which, underlies, the, diversity, of, its, many, forms, according, to, flood, vivekananda, s, view, of, hinduism, is, the, most, common, among, hindus, today, this, monism, according, to, flood, is, at, the, foundation, of, earlier, upanishads, to, theosophy, in, the, later, vedanta, tradition, and, in, modern, neo, hinduism, according, to, the, p, li, canon, both, pluralism, n, natta, and, monism, ekatta, are, speculative, views, a, theravada, commentary, notes, that, the, former, is, similar, to, or, associated, with, nihilism, ucch, dav, da, and, the, latter, is, similar, to, or, associated, with, eternalism, sassatavada, within, buddhism, a, rich, variety, of, philosophical, and, pedagogical, models, can, be, found, various, schools, of, buddhism, discern, levels, of, truth, the, prajnaparamita, sutras, and, madhyamaka, emphasize, the, non, duality, of, form, and, emptiness, form, is, emptiness, emptiness, is, form, as, the, heart, sutra, says, in, chinese, buddhism, this, was, understood, to, mean, that, ultimate, reality, is, not, a, transcendental, realm, but, equal, to, the, daily, world, of, relative, reality, this, idea, was, well, situated, for, the, existing, chinese, culture, which, emphasized, the, mundane, world, and, society, but, this, does, not, tell, how, the, absolute, is, present, in, the, relative, world, to, deny, the, duality, of, samsara, and, nirvana, as, the, perfection, of, wisdom, does, or, to, demonstrate, logically, the, error, of, dichotomizing, conceptualization, as, nagarjuna, does, is, not, to, address, the, question, of, the, relationship, between, samsara, and, nirvana, or, in, more, philosophical, terms, between, phenomenal, and, ultimate, reality, what, then, is, the, relationship, between, these, two, realms, this, question, is, answered, in, such, schemata, as, the, five, ranks, of, tozan, the, oxherding, pictures, and, hakuin, s, four, ways, of, knowing, sikhism, complies, with, the, concept, of, absolute, monism, sikh, philosophy, advocates, that, all, that, our, senses, comprehend, is, an, illusion, god, is, the, ultimate, reality, forms, being, subject, to, time, shall, pass, away, god, s, reality, alone, is, eternal, and, abiding, the, thought, is, that, atma, soul, is, born, from, and, a, reflection, of, paramatma, supreme, soul, and, will, again, merge, into, it, in, the, words, of, the, fifth, guru, of, sikhs, guru, arjan, just, as, water, merges, back, into, the, water, god, and, soul, are, fundamentally, the, same, identical, in, the, same, way, as, fire, and, its, sparks, atam, meh, ram, ram, meh, atam, which, means, the, ultimate, eternal, reality, resides, in, the, soul, and, the, soul, is, contained, in, him, as, from, one, stream, millions, of, waves, arise, and, yet, the, waves, made, of, water, again, become, water, in, the, same, way, all, souls, have, sprung, from, the, universal, being, and, would, blend, again, into, it, jewish, thought, considers, god, as, separate, from, all, physical, created, things, and, as, existing, outside, of, time, according, to, maimonides, god, is, an, incorporeal, being, that, caused, all, other, existence, according, to, maimonides, to, admit, corporeality, to, god, is, tantamount, to, admitting, complexity, to, god, which, is, a, contradiction, to, god, as, the, first, cause, and, constitutes, heresy, while, hasidic, mystics, considered, the, existence, of, the, physical, world, a, contradiction, to, god, s, simpleness, maimonides, saw, no, contradiction, according, to, hasidic, thought, particularly, as, propounded, by, the, 18th, century, early, 19th, century, founder, of, chabad, shneur, zalman, of, liadi, god, is, held, to, be, immanent, within, creation, for, two, interrelated, reasons, the, vilna, gaon, was, very, much, against, this, philosophy, for, he, felt, that, it, would, lead, to, pantheism, and, heresy, according, to, some, this, is, the, main, reason, for, the, gaon, s, ban, on, chasidism, christians, maintain, that, god, created, the, universe, ex, nihilo, and, not, from, his, own, substance, so, that, the, creator, is, not, to, be, confused, with, creation, but, rather, transcends, it, there, is, a, movement, of, christian, panentheism, in, on, free, choice, of, the, will, augustine, argued, in, the, context, of, the, problem, of, evil, that, evil, is, not, the, opposite, of, good, but, rather, merely, the, absence, of, good, something, that, does, not, have, existence, in, itself, likewise, c, s, lewis, described, evil, as, a, parasite, in, mere, christianity, as, he, viewed, evil, as, something, that, cannot, exist, without, good, to, provide, it, with, existence, lewis, went, on, to, argue, against, dualism, from, the, basis, of, moral, absolutism, and, rejected, the, dualistic, notion, that, god, and, satan, are, opposites, arguing, instead, that, god, has, no, equal, hence, no, opposite, lewis, rather, viewed, satan, as, the, opposite, of, michael, the, archangel, due, to, this, lewis, instead, argued, for, a, more, limited, type, of, dualism, other, theologians, such, as, greg, boyd, have, argued, in, more, depth, that, the, biblical, authors, held, a, limited, dualism, meaning, that, god, and, satan, do, engage, in, real, battle, but, only, due, to, free, will, given, by, god, for, the, duration, that, god, allows, latter, day, saint, theology, also, expresses, a, form, of, dual, aspect, monism, via, materialism, and, eternalism, claiming, that, creation, was, ex, materia, as, opposed, to, ex, nihilo, in, conventional, christianity, as, expressed, by, parley, pratt, and, echoed, in, view, by, the, movement, s, founder, joseph, smith, making, no, distinction, between, the, spiritual, and, the, material, these, being, not, just, similarly, eternal, but, ultimately, two, manifestations, of, the, same, reality, or, substance, parley, pratt, implies, a, vitalism, paired, with, evolutionary, adaptation, noting, these, eternal, self, existing, elements, possess, in, themselves, certain, inherent, properties, or, attributes, in, a, greater, or, less, degree, or, in, other, words, they, possess, intelligence, adapted, to, their, several, spheres, parley, pratt, s, view, is, also, similar, to, gottfried, leibniz, s, monadology, which, holds, that, reality, consists, of, mind, atoms, that, are, living, centers, of, force, brigham, young, anticipates, a, proto, mentality, of, elementary, particles, with, his, vitalist, view, there, is, life, in, all, matter, throughout, the, vast, extent, of, all, the, eternities, it, is, in, the, rock, the, sand, the, dust, in, water, air, the, gases, and, in, short, in, every, description, and, organization, of, matter, whether, it, be, solid, liquid, or, gaseous, particle, operating, with, particle, the, lds, conception, of, matter, is, essentially, dynamic, rather, than, static, if, indeed, it, is, not, a, kind, of, living, energy, and, that, it, is, subject, at, least, to, the, rule, of, intelligence, john, a, widstoe, held, a, similar, more, vitalist, view, that, life, is, nothing, more, than, matter, in, motion, that, therefore, all, matter, possess, a, kind, of, life, matter, intelligence, hence, everything, in, the, universe, is, alive, however, widstoe, resisted, outright, affirming, a, belief, in, panpsychism, vincent, cornell, argues, that, the, quran, provides, a, monist, image, of, god, by, describing, reality, as, a, unified, whole, with, god, being, a, single, concept, that, would, describe, or, ascribe, all, existing, things, but, most, argue, that, abrahamic, religious, scriptures, especially, the, quran, see, creation, and, god, as, two, separate, existences, it, explains, that, everything, has, been, created, by, god, and, is, under, his, control, but, at, the, same, time, distinguishes, creation, as, being, dependent, on, the, existence, of, god, some, sufi, mystics, advocate, monism, one, of, the, most, notable, being, the, 13th, century, persian, poet, rumi, 1207, 1273, in, his, didactic, poem, masnavi, espoused, monism, rumi, says, in, the, masnavi, in, the, shop, for, unity, wahdat, anything, that, you, see, there, except, the, one, is, an, idol, other, sufi, mystics, however, such, as, ahmad, sirhindi, upheld, dualistic, monotheism, the, separation, of, god, and, the, universe, the, most, influential, of, the, islamic, monists, was, the, sufi, philosopher, ibn, arabi, 1165, 1240, he, developed, the, concept, of, unity, of, being, arabic, wa, dat, al, wuj, d, which, some, argue, is, a, monistic, philosophy, born, in, al, andalus, he, made, an, enormous, impact, on, the, muslim, world, where, he, was, crowned, the, great, master, in, the, centuries, following, his, death, his, ideas, became, increasingly, controversial, ahmad, sirhindi, criticised, monistic, understanding, of, unity, of, being, advocating, the, dualistic, compatible, unity, of, witness, arabic, wahdat, ash, shuhud, maintaining, separation, of, creator, and, creation, later, shah, waliullah, dehlawi, reconciled, the, two, ideas, maintaining, that, their, differences, are, semantic, differences, arguing, that, the, universal, existence, which, is, different, in, creation, to, creator, and, the, divine, essence, are, different, and, that, the, universal, existence, emanates, in, a, non, platonic, sense, from, the, divine, essence, and, that, the, relationship, between, them, is, similar, to, the, relationship, between, the, number, four, and, a, number, being, even, the, doctrine, of, wa, dat, al, wuj, d, also, enjoys, considerable, following, in, the, rationalist, philosophy, of, twelver, shi, ism, with, the, most, famous, modern, day, adherent, being, ruhollah, khomeini, although, the, teachings, of, the, bah, faith, have, a, strong, emphasis, on, social, and, ethical, issues, there, exist, a, number, of, foundational, texts, that, have, been, described, as, mystical, some, of, these, include, statements, of, a, monist, nature, e, g, the, seven, valleys, and, the, hidden, words, the, differences, between, dualist, and, monist, views, are, reconciled, by, the, teaching, that, these, opposing, viewpoints, are, caused, by, differences, in, the, observers, themselves, not, in, that, which, is, observed, this, is, not, a, higher, truth, lower, truth, position, god, is, unknowable, for, man, it, is, impossible, to, acquire, any, direct, knowledge, of, god, or, the, absolute, because, any, knowledge, that, one, has, is, relative
