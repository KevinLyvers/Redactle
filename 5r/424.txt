as, the, vampire, originates, almost, exclusively, from, early, 18th, century, southeastern, europe, when, verbal, traditions, of, many, ethnic, groups, of, the, region, were, recorded, and, published, in, most, cases, vampires, are, revenants, of, evil, beings, suicide, victims, or, witches, but, they, can, also, be, created, by, a, malevolent, spirit, possessing, a, corpse, or, by, being, bitten, by, a, vampire, belief, in, such, legends, became, so, pervasive, that, in, some, areas, it, caused, mass, hysteria, and, even, public, executions, of, people, believed, to, be, vampires, it, is, difficult, to, make, a, single, definitive, description, of, the, folkloric, vampire, though, there, are, several, elements, common, to, many, european, legends, vampires, were, usually, reported, as, bloated, in, appearance, and, ruddy, purplish, or, dark, in, colour, these, characteristics, were, often, attributed, to, the, recent, drinking, of, blood, which, was, often, seen, seeping, from, the, mouth, and, nose, when, one, was, seen, in, its, shroud, or, coffin, and, its, left, eye, was, often, open, it, would, be, clad, in, the, linen, shroud, it, was, buried, in, and, its, teeth, hair, and, nails, may, have, grown, somewhat, though, in, general, fangs, were, not, a, feature, chewing, sounds, were, reported, emanating, from, graves, the, causes, of, vampiric, generation, were, many, and, varied, in, original, folklore, in, slavic, and, chinese, traditions, any, corpse, that, was, jumped, over, by, an, animal, particularly, a, dog, or, a, cat, was, feared, to, become, one, of, the, undead, a, body, with, a, wound, that, had, not, been, treated, with, boiling, water, was, also, at, risk, in, russian, folklore, vampires, were, said, to, have, once, been, witches, or, people, who, had, rebelled, against, the, russian, orthodox, church, while, they, were, alive, in, albanian, folklore, the, dhampir, is, the, hybrid, child, of, the, karkanxholl, a, lycanthropic, creature, with, an, iron, mail, shirt, or, the, lugat, a, water, dwelling, ghost, or, monster, the, dhampir, sprung, of, a, karkanxholl, has, the, unique, ability, to, discern, the,

a, lugat, in, different, regions, animals, can, be, revenants, as, lugats, also, living, people, during, their, sleep, dhampiraj, is, also, an, albanian, surname, cultural, practices, often, arose, that, were, intended, to, prevent, a, recently, deceased, loved, one, from, turning, into, an, undead, revenant, burying, a, corpse, upside, down, was, widespread, as, was, placing, earthly, objects, such, as, scythes, or, sickles, near, the, grave, to, satisfy, any, demons, entering, the, body, or, to, appease, the, dead, so, that, it, would, not, wish, to, arise, from, its, coffin, this, method, resembles, the, ancient, greek, practice, of, placing, an, obolus, in, the, corpse, s, mouth, to, pay, the, toll, to, cross, the, river, styx, in, the, underworld, the, coin, may, have, also, been, intended, to, ward, off, any, evil, spirits, from, entering, the, body, and, this, may, have, influenced, later, vampire, folklore, this, tradition, persisted, in, modern, greek, folklore, about, the, vrykolakas, in, which, a, wax, cross, and, piece, of, pottery, with, the, inscription, jesus, christ, conquers, were, placed, on, the, corpse, to, prevent, the, body, from, becoming, a, vampire, other, methods, commonly, practised, in, europe, included, severing, the, tendons, at, the, knees, or, placing, poppy, seeds, millet, or, sand, on, the, ground, at, the, grave, site, of, a, presumed, vampire, this, was, intended, to, keep, the, vampire, occupied, all, night, by, counting, the, fallen, grains, indicating, an, association, of, vampires, with, arithmomania, similar, chinese, narratives, state, that, if, a, vampiric, being, came, across, a, sack, of, rice, it, would, have, to, count, every, grain, this, is, a, theme, encountered, in, myths, from, the, indian, subcontinent, as, well, as, in, south, american, tales, of, witches, and, other, sorts, of, evil, or, mischievous, spirits, or, beings, many, rituals, were, used, to, identify, a, vampire, one, method, of, finding, a, vampire, s, grave, involved, leading, a, virgin, boy, through, a, graveyard, or, church, grounds, on, a, virgin, stallion, the, horse, would, supposedly, balk, at, the, grave, in, question, generally, a, black, horse, was, required, though, in, albania, it, should, be, white, holes, appearing, in, the, earth, over, a, grave, were, taken, as, a, sign, of, vampirism, corpses, thought, to, be, vampires, were, generally, described, as, having, a, healthier, appearance, than, expected, plump, and, showing, little, or, no, signs, of, decomposition, in, some, cases, when, suspected, graves, were, opened, villagers, even, described, the, corpse, as, having, fresh, blood, from, a, victim, all, over, its, face, evidence, that, a, vampire, was, active, in, a, given, locality, included, death, of, cattle, sheep, relatives, or, neighbours, folkloric, vampires, could, also, make, their, presence, felt, by, engaging, in, minor, poltergeist, styled, activity, such, as, hurling, stones, on, roofs, or, moving, household, objects, and, pressing, on, people, in, their, sleep, apotropaics, items, able, to, ward, off, revenants, are, common, in, vampire, folklore, garlic, is, a, common, example, a, branch, of, wild, rose, and, hawthorn, are, sometimes, associated, with, causing, harm, to, vampires, and, in, europe, mustard, seeds, would, be, sprinkled, on, the, roof, of, a, house, to, keep, them, away, other, apotropaics, include, sacred, items, such, as, crucifix, rosary, or, holy, water, some, folklore, also, states, that, vampires, are, unable, to, walk, on, consecrated, ground, such, as, that, of, churches, or, temples, or, cross, running, water, although, not, traditionally, regarded, as, an, apotropaic, mirrors, have, been, used, to, ward, off, vampires, when, placed, facing, outwards, on, a, door, in, some, cultures, vampires, do, not, have, a, reflection, and, sometimes, do, not, cast, a, shadow, perhaps, as, a, manifestation, of, the, vampire, s, lack, of, a, soul, this, attribute, is, not, universal, the, greek, vrykolakas, tympanios, was, capable, of, both, reflection, and, shadow, but, was, used, by, bram, stoker, in, dracula, and, has, remained, popular, with, subsequent, authors, and, filmmakers, some, traditions, also, hold, that, a, vampire, cannot, enter, a, house, unless, invited, by, the, owner, after, the, first, invitation, they, can, come, and, go, as, they, please, though, folkloric, vampires, were, believed, to, be, more, active, at, night, they, were, not, generally, considered, vulnerable, to, sunlight, reports, in, 1693, and, 1694, concerning, citings, of, vampires, in, poland, and, russia, claimed, that, when, a, vampire, s, grave, was, recognized, eating, bread, baked, with, its, blood, mixed, into, the, flour, or, simply, drinking, it, granted, the, possibility, of, protection, other, stories, primarily, the, arnold, paole, case, claimed, the, eating, of, dirt, from, the, vampire, s, grave, would, have, the, same, effect, methods, of, destroying, suspected, vampires, varied, with, staking, the, most, commonly, cited, method, particularly, in, south, slavic, cultures, ash, was, the, preferred, wood, in, russia, and, the, baltic, states, or, hawthorn, in, serbia, with, a, record, of, oak, in, silesia, aspen, was, also, used, for, stakes, as, it, was, believed, that, christ, s, cross, was, made, from, aspen, aspen, branches, on, the, graves, of, purported, vampires, were, also, believed, to, prevent, their, risings, at, night, potential, vampires, were, most, often, staked, through, the, heart, though, the, mouth, was, targeted, in, russia, and, northern, germany, and, the, stomach, in, north, eastern, serbia, piercing, the, skin, of, the, chest, was, a, way, of, deflating, the, bloated, vampire, this, is, similar, to, a, practice, of, anti, vampire, burial, burying, sharp, objects, such, as, sickles, with, the, corpse, so, that, they, may, penetrate, the, skin, if, the, body, bloats, sufficiently, while, transforming, into, a, revenant, decapitation, was, the, preferred, method, in, german, and, western, slavic, areas, with, the, head, buried, between, the, feet, behind, the, buttocks, or, away, from, the, body, this, act, was, seen, as, a, way, of, hastening, the, departure, of, the, soul, which, in, some, cultures, was, said, to, linger, in, the, corpse, the, vampire, s, head, body, or, clothes, could, also, be, spiked, and, pinned, to, the, earth, to, prevent, rising, romani, people, drove, steel, or, iron, needles, into, a, corpse, s, heart, and, placed, bits, of,

the, legs, in, a, 16th, century, burial, near, venice, a, brick, forced, into, the, mouth, of, a, female, corpse, has, been, interpreted, as, a, vampire, slaying, ritual, by, the, archaeologists, who, discovered, it, in, 2006, in, bulgaria, over, 100, skeletons, with, metal, objects, such, as, plough, bits, embedded, in, the, torso, have, been, discovered, further, measures, included, pouring, boiling, water, over, the, grave, or, complete, incineration, of, the, body, in, southeastern, europe, a, vampire, could, also, be, killed, by, being, shot, or, drowned, by, repeating, the, funeral, service, by, sprinkling, holy, water, on, the, body, or, by, exorcism, in, romania, garlic, could, be, placed, in, the, mouth, and, as, recently, as, the, 19th, century, the, precaution, of, shooting,

by, otto, in, 1732, and, then, by, michael, ranft, in, 1734, the, subject, was, based, on, the, observation, that, when, digging, up, graves, it, was, discovered, that, some, corpses, had, at, some, point, either, devoured, the, interior, fabric, of, their, coffin, or, their, own, limbs, ranft, described, in, his, treatise, of, a, tradition, in, some, parts, of, germany, that, to, prevent, the, dead, from, masticating, they, placed, a, mound, of, dirt, under, their, chin, in, the, coffin, placed, a, piece, of, money, and, a, stone, in, the, mouth, or, tied, a, handkerchief, tightly, around,

traditionally, considered, highly, problematic, within, christianity, as, their, apparent, immortal, existence, ran, against, the, christian, belief, that, all, true, believers, may, look, forward, to, an, eternal, existence, with, body, and, soul, as, they, were, resurrected, but, only, at, the, end, of, time, when, jesus, returns, to, judge, the, living, and, the, dead, those, who, are, resurrected, as, immortal, before, this, are, thus, in, no, way, part, of, the, divine, plan, of, salvation, the, imperfect, state, of, the, vampire, body, and, how, they, in, spite, of, their, immortal, nature, still, needed, to, feed, of, the, blood, of, the, living, further, reflected, the, problematic, aspect, of, the, vampires, contrary, to, how, the, incorruptible, saints, foreshadowed, the, immortality, promised, all, true, christians, at, the, end, of, time, the, immortality, of, the, undead, vampires, was, thus, not, a, sign, of, salvation, but, of, perdition, the, unholy, dimension, of, vampirism, may, also, be, reflected, in, how, in, parts, of, russia, the, very, word, heretic, eretik, was, synonymous, with, a, vampire, whoever, denied, god, or, his, commandments, became, an, eretik, after, his, death, the, improperly, immortal, figure, that, wandered, the, night, in, search, of, people, to, feed, on, a, paragraph, on, vampires, was, included, in,

to, vampires, were, purely, natural, or, the, fruit, of, imagination, terror, and, fear, in, other, words, vampires, did, not, exist, in, the, early, 18th, century, despite, the, decline, of, many, popular, folkloric, beliefs, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, popular, belief, in, vampires, resulting, in, a, mass, hysteria, throughout, much, of, europe, the, panic, began, with, an, outbreak, of, alleged, vampire, attacks, in, east, prussia, in, 1721, and, in, the, habsburg, monarchy, from, 1725, to, 1734, which, spread, to, other, localities, the, first, infamous, vampire, case, involved, the, corpses, of, petar, blagojevi, from, serbia, blagojevi, was, reported, to, have, died, at, the, age, of, 62, but, allegedly, returned, after, his, death, asking, his, son, for, food, when, the, son, refused, he, was, found, dead, the, following, day, blagojevi, supposedly, returned, and, attacked, some, neighbours, who, died, from, loss, of, blood, in, the, second, case, milo, e, ar, an, ex, soldier, turned, farmer, who, allegedly, was, attacked, by, a, vampire, years, before, died, while, haying, after, his, death, people, began, to, die, in, the, surrounding, area, it, was, widely, believed, that, milo, had, returned, to, prey, on, the, neighbours, the, blagojevi, and, e, ar, incidents, were, well, documented, government, officials, examined, the, bodies, wrote, case, reports, and, published, books, throughout, europe, the, problem, was, exacerbated, by, rural, epidemics, of, so, called, vampire, attacks, undoubtedly, caused, by, the, higher, amount, of, superstition, that, was, present, in, village, communities, with, locals, digging, up, bodies, and, in, some, cases, staking, them, even, government, officials, engaged, in, the, hunting, and, staking, of, vampires, the, hysteria, commonly, referred, to, as, the, vampire, controversy, continued, for, a, generation, at, least, sixteen, contemporary, treatises,

titled, treatise, on, the, apparitions, of, spirits, and, on, vampires, or, revenants, which, investigated, and, analysed, the, evidence, for, vampirism, numerous, readers, including, both, voltaire, critical, and, numerous, demonologists, supportive, interpreted, the, treatise, as, claiming, that, vampires, existed, the, controversy, in, austria, ceased, when, empress, maria, theresa, sent, her, personal, physician, gerard, van, swieten, to, investigate, the, claims, of, vampiric, entities, van, swieten, concluded, that, vampires, did, not, exist, and, the, empress, passed, laws, prohibiting, the, opening, of, graves, and, the, desecration, of, bodies, thus, ending, the, vampire, epidemic, other, european, countries, followed, suit, despite, this, condemnation, the, vampire, lived, on, in,

literature, in, hong, kong, and, east, asia, films, like, encounters, of, the, spooky, kind, and, mr, vampire, were, released, during, the, jiangshi, cinematic, boom, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, modern, fiction, the, vampire, tends, to, be, depicted, as, a, suave, charismatic, villain, vampire, hunting, societies, still, exist, but, they, are, largely, formed, for, social, reasons, allegations, of, vampire, attacks, swept, through, malawi, during, late, 2002, and, early, 2003, with, mobs, stoning, one, person, to, death, and, attacking, at, least, four, others, including, governor, eric, chiwaya, based, on, the, belief, that, the, government, was, colluding, with, vampires, fears, and, violence, recurred, in, late, 2017, with, 6, people, accused, of, being, vampires, killed, in, early, 1970, local, press, spread, rumours, that, a, vampire, haunted, highgate, cemetery, in, london, amateur, vampire, hunters, flocked, in, large, numbers, to, the, cemetery, several, books, have, been, written, about, the, case, notably, by, sean, manchester, a, local, man, who, was, among, the, first, to, suggest, the, existence, of, the, highgate, vampire, and, who, later, claimed, to, have, exorcised, and, destroyed, a, whole, nest, of, vampires, in, the, area, in, january, 2005, rumours, circulated, that, an, attacker, had, bitten, a, number, of, people, in, birmingham, england, fuelling, concerns, about, a, vampire, roaming, the, streets, local, police, stated, that, no, such, crime, had, been, reported, and, that, the, case, appears, to, be, an, urban, legend, the, chupacabra, goat, sucker, of, puerto, rico, and, mexico, is, said, to, be, a, creature, that, feeds, upon, the, flesh, or, drinks, the, blood, of, domesticated, animals, leading, some, to, consider, it, a, kind, of, vampire, the, chupacabra, hysteria, was, frequently, associated, with, deep, economic, and, political, crises, particularly, during, the, mid, 1990s, in, europe, where, much, of, the, vampire, folklore, originates, the, vampire, is, usually, considered, a, fictitious, being, many, communities, may, have, embraced, the, revenant, for, economic, purposes, in, some, cases, especially, in, small, localities, beliefs, are, still, rampant, and, sightings, or, claims, of, vampire, attacks, occur, frequently, in, romania, during, february, 2004, several, relatives, of, toma, petre, feared, that, he, had, become, a, vampire, they, dug, up, his, corpse, tore, out, his, heart, burned, it, and, mixed, the, ashes, with, water, in, order, to, drink, it, commentators, have, offered, many, theories, for, the, origins, of, vampire, beliefs, and, related, mass, hysteria, everything, ranging, from, premature, burial, to, the, early, ignorance, of, the, body, s, decomposition, cycle, after, death, has, been, cited, as, the, cause, for, the, belief, in, vampires, author, paul, barber, stated, that, belief, in, vampires, resulted, from, people, of, pre, industrial, societies, attempting, to, explain, the, natural, but, to, them, inexplicable, process, of, death, and, decomposition, people, sometimes, suspected, vampirism, when, a, cadaver, did, not, look, as, they, thought, a, normal, corpse, should, when, disinterred, rates, of, decomposition, vary, depending, on, temperature, and, soil, composition, and, many, of, the, signs, are, little, known, this, has, led, vampire, hunters, to, mistakenly, conclude, that, a, dead, body, had, not, decomposed, at, all, or, to, interpret, signs, of, decomposition, as, signs, of, continued, life, corpses, swell, as, gases, from, decomposition, accumulate, in, the, torso, and, the, increased, pressure, forces, blood, to, ooze, from, the, nose, and, mouth, this, causes, the, body, to, look, plump, well, fed, and, ruddy, changes, that, are, all, the, more, striking, if, the, person, was, pale, or, thin, in, life, in, the, arnold, paole, case, an, old, woman, s, exhumed, corpse, was, judged, by, her, neighbours, to, look, more, plump, and, healthy, than, she, had, ever, looked, in, life, the, exuding, blood, gave, the, impression, that, the, corpse, had, recently, been, engaging, in, vampiric, activity, darkening, of, the, skin, is, also, caused, by, decomposition, the, staking, of, a, swollen, decomposing, body, could, cause, the, body, to, bleed, and, force, the, accumulated, gases, to, escape, the, body, this, could, produce, a, groan, like, sound, when, the, gases, moved, past, the, vocal, cords, or, a, sound, reminiscent, of, flatulence, when, they, passed, through, the, anus, the, official, reporting, on, the, petar, blagojevich, case, speaks, of, other, wild, signs, which, i, pass, by, out, of, high, respect, after, death, the, skin, and, gums, lose, fluids, and, contract, exposing, the, roots, of, the, hair, nails, and, teeth, even, teeth, that, were, concealed, in, the, jaw, this, can, produce, the, illusion, that, the, hair, nails, and, teeth, have, grown, at, a, certain, stage, the, nails, fall, off, and, the, skin, peels, away, as, reported, in, the, blagojevich, case, the, dermis, and, nail, beds, emerging, underneath, were, interpreted, as, new, skin, and, new, nails, vampire, legends, may, have, also, been, influenced, by, individuals, being, buried, alive, because, of, shortcomings, in, the, medical, knowledge, of, the, time, in, some, cases, in, which, people, reported, sounds, emanating, from, a, specific, coffin, it, was, later, dug, up, and, fingernail, marks, were, discovered, on, the, inside, from, the, victim, trying, to, escape, in, other, cases, the, person, would, hit, their, heads, noses, or, faces, and, it, would, appear, that, they, had, been, feeding, a, problem, with, this, theory, is, the, question, of, how, people, presumably, buried, alive, managed, to, stay, alive, for, any, extended, period, without, food, water, or, fresh, air, an, alternate, explanation, for, noise, is, the, bubbling, of, escaping, gases, from, natural, decomposition, of, bodies, another, likely, cause, of, disordered, tombs, is, grave, robbery, folkloric, vampirism, has, been, associated, with, clusters, of, deaths, from, unidentifiable, or, mysterious, illnesses, usually, within, the, same, family, or, the, same, small, community, the, epidemic, allusion, is, obvious, in, the, classical, cases, of, petar, blagojevich, and, arnold, paole, and, even, more, so, in, the, case, of, mercy, brown, and, in, the, vampire, beliefs, of, new, england, generally, where, a, specific, disease, tuberculosis, was, associated, with, outbreaks, of, vampirism, as, with, the, pneumonic, form, of, bubonic, plague, it, was, associated, with, breakdown, of, lung, tissue, which, would, cause, blood, to, appear, at, the, lips, in, 1985, biochemist, david, dolphin, proposed, a, link, between, the, rare, blood, disorder, porphyria, and, vampire, folklore, noting, that, the, condition, is, treated, by, intravenous, haem, he, suggested, that, the, consumption, of, large, amounts, of, blood, may, result, in, haem, being, transported, somehow, across, the, stomach, wall, and, into, the, bloodstream, thus, vampires, were, merely, sufferers, of, porphyria, seeking, to, replace, haem, and, alleviate, their, symptoms, the, theory, has, been, rebuffed, medically, as, suggestions, that, porphyria, sufferers, crave, the, haem, in, human, blood, or, that, the, consumption, of, blood, might, ease, the, symptoms, of, porphyria, are, based, on, a, misunderstanding, of, the, disease, furthermore, dolphin, was, noted, to, have, confused, fictional, bloodsucking, vampires, with, those, of, folklore, many, of, whom, were, not, noted, to, drink, blood, similarly, a, parallel, is, made, between, sensitivity, to, sunlight, by, sufferers, yet, this, was, associated, with, fictional, and, not, folkloric, vampires, in, any, case, dolphin, did, not, go, on, to, publish, his, work, more, widely, despite, being, dismissed, by, experts, the, link, gained, media, attention, and, entered, popular, modern, folklore, juan, g, mez, alonso, a, neurologist, examined, the, possible, link, of, rabies, with, vampire, folklore, the, susceptibility, to, garlic, and, light, could, be, due, to, hypersensitivity, which, is, a, symptom, of, rabies, it, can, also, affect, portions, of, the, brain, that, could, lead, to, disturbance, of, normal, sleep, patterns, thus, becoming, nocturnal, and, hypersexuality, legend, once, said, a, man, was, not, rabid, if, he, could, look, at, his, own, reflection, an, allusion, to, the, legend, that, vampires, have, no, reflection, wolves, and, bats, which, are, often, associated, with, vampires, can, be, carriers, of, rabies, the, disease, can, also, lead, to, a, drive, to, bite, others, and, to, a, bloody, frothing, at, the, mouth, in, his, 1931, treatise, on, the, nightmare, welsh, psychoanalyst, ernest, jones, asserted, that, vampires, are, symbolic, of, several, unconscious, drives, and, defence, mechanisms, emotions, such, as, love, guilt, and, hate, fuel, the, idea, of, the, return, of, the, dead, to, the, grave, desiring, a, reunion, with, loved, ones, mourners, may, project, the, idea, that, the, recently, dead, must, in, return, yearn, the, same, from, this, arises, the, belief, that, folkloric, vampires, and, revenants, visit, relatives, particularly, their, spouses, first, in, cases, where, there, was, unconscious, guilt, associated, with, the, relationship, the, wish, for, reunion, may, be, subverted, by, anxiety, this, may, lead, to, repression, which, sigmund, freud, had, linked, with, the, development, of, morbid, dread, jones, surmised, in, this, case, the, original, wish, of, a, sexual, reunion, may, be, drastically, changed, desire, is, replaced, by, fear, love, is, replaced, by, sadism, and, the, object, or, loved, one, is, replaced, by, an, unknown, entity, the, sexual, aspect, may, or, may, not, be, present, some, modern, critics, have, proposed, a, simpler, theory, people, identify, with, immortal, vampires, because, by, so, doing, they, overcome, or, at, least, temporarily, escape, from, their, fear, of, dying, jones, linked, the, innate, sexuality, of, bloodsucking, with, cannibalism, with, a, folkloric, connection, with, incubus, like, behaviour, he, added, that, when, more, normal, aspects, of, sexuality, are, repressed, regressed, forms, may, be, expressed, in, particular, sadism, he, felt, that, oral, sadism, is, integral, in, vampiric, behaviour, the, reinvention, of, the, vampire, myth, in, the, modern, era, is, not, without, political, overtones, the, aristocratic, count, dracula, alone, in, his, castle, apart, from, a, few, demented, retainers, appearing, only, at, night, to, feed, on, his, peasantry, is, symbolic, of, the, parasitic, ancien, r, gime, in, his, entry, for, vampires, in, the, dictionnaire, philosophique, 1764, voltaire, notices, how, the, mid, 18th, century, coincided, with, the, decline, of, the, folkloric, belief, in, the, existence, of, vampires, but, that, now, there, were, stock, jobbers, brokers, and, men, of, business, who, sucked, the, blood, of, the, people, in, broad, daylight, but, they, were, not, dead, though, corrupted, these, true, suckers, lived, not, in, cemeteries, but, in, very, agreeable, palaces, marx, defined, capital, as, dead, labour, which, vampire, like, lives, only, by, sucking, living, labour, and, lives, the, more, the, more, labour, it, sucks, werner, herzog, in, his, nosferatu, the, vampyre, gives, this, political, interpretation, an, extra, ironic, twist, when, protagonist, jonathan, harker, a, middle, class, solicitor, becomes, the, next, vampire, in, this, way, the, capitalist, bourgeois, becomes, the, next, parasitic, class, a, number, of, murderers, have, performed, seemingly, vampiric, rituals, upon, their, victims, serial, killers, peter, k, rten, and, richard, trenton, chase, were, both, called, vampires, in, the, tabloids, after, they, were, discovered, drinking, the, blood, of, the, people, they, murdered, in, 1932, an, unsolved, murder, case, in, stockholm, sweden, was, nicknamed, the, vampire, murder, because, of, the, circumstances, of, the, victim, s, death, the, late, 16th, century, hungarian, countess, and, mass, murderer, elizabeth, b, thory, became, infamous, in, later, centuries, works, which, depicted, her, bathing, in, her, victims, blood, to, retain, beauty, or, youth, although, many, cultures, have, stories, about, them, vampire, bats, have, only, recently, become, an, integral, part, of, the, traditional, vampire, lore, vampire, bats, were, integrated, into, vampire, folklore, after, they, were, discovered, on, the, south, american, mainland, in, the, 16th, century, there, are, no, vampire, bats, in, europe, but, bats, and, owls, have, long, been, associated, with, the, supernatural, and, omens, mainly, because, of, their, nocturnal, habits, the, three, species, of, vampire, bats, are, all, endemic, to, latin, america, and, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, they, had, any, old, world, relatives, within, human, memory, it, is, therefore, impossible, that, the, folkloric, vampire, represents, a, distorted, presentation, or, memory, of, the, vampire, bat, the, bats, were, named, after, the, folkloric, vampire, rather, than, vice, versa, the, oxford, english, dictionary, records, their, folkloric, use, in, english, from, 1734, and, the, zoological, not, until, 1774, the, danger, of, rabies, infection, aside, the, vampire, bat, s, bite, is, usually, not, harmful, to, a, person, but, the, bat, has, been, known, to, actively, feed, on, humans, and, large, prey, such, as, cattle, and, often, leaves, the, trademark, two, prong, bite, mark, on, its, victim, s, skin, the, literary, dracula, transforms, into, a, bat, several, times, in, the, novel, and, vampire, bats, themselves, are, mentioned, twice, in, it, the, 1927, stage, production, of, dracula, followed, the, novel, in, having, dracula, turn, into, a, bat, as, did, the, film, where, b, la, lugosi, would, transform, into, a, bat, the, bat, transformation, scene, was, used, again, by, lon, chaney, jr, in, 1943, s, son, of, dracula, the, vampire, is, now, a, fixture, in, popular, fiction, such, fiction, began, with, 18th, century, poetry, and, continued, with, 19th, century, short, stories, the, first, and, most, influential, of, which, was, john, polidori, s, the, vampyre, 1819, featuring, the, vampire, lord, ruthven, lord, ruthven, s, exploits, were, further, explored, in, a, series, of, vampire, plays, in, which, he, was, the, antihero, the, vampire, theme, continued, in, penny, dreadful, serial, publications, such, as, varney, the, vampire, 1847, and, culminated, in, the, pre, eminent, vampire, novel, in, history, dracula, by, bram, stoker, published, in, 1897, over, time, some, attributes, now, regarded, as, integral, became, incorporated, into, the, vampire, s, profile, fangs, and, vulnerability, to, sunlight, appeared, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, with, varney, the, vampire, and, count, dracula, both, bearing, protruding, teeth, and, count, orlok, of, murnau, s, nosferatu, 1922, fearing, daylight, the, cloak, appeared, in, stage, productions, of, the, 1920s, with, a, high, collar, introduced, by,

folklore, implied, though, not, often, explicitly, documented, in, folklore, immortality, is, one, attribute, which, features, heavily, in, vampire, films, and, literature, much, is, made, of, the,
