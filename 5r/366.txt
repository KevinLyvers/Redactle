incarnate, of, vishnu, is, found, in, the, burmese, version, of, rama, s, life, story, called, thiri, rama, rama, s, legends, vary, significantly, by, the, region, and, across, manuscripts, while, there, is, a, common, foundation, plot, grammar, and, an, essential, core, of, values, associated, with, a, battle, between, good, and, evil, there, is, neither, a, correct, version, nor, a, single, verifiable, ancient, one, according, to, paula, richman, there, are, hundreds, of, versions, of, the, story, of, rama, in, india, southeast, asia, and, beyond, the, versions, vary, by, region, reflecting, local, preoccupations, and, histories, and, these, cannot, be, called, divergences, or, different, tellings, from, the, real, version, rather, all, the, versions, of, rama, story, are, real, and, true, in, their, own, meanings, to, the, local, cultural, tradition, according, to, scholars, such, as, richman, and, ramanujan, the, stories, vary, in, details, particularly, where, the, moral, question, is, clear, but, the, appropriate, ethical, response, is, unclear, or, disputed, for, example, when, demoness, shurpanakha, disguises, as, a, woman, to, seduce, rama, then, stalks, and, harasses, rama, s, wife, sita, after, rama, refuses, her, lakshmana, is, faced, with, the, question, of, appropriate, ethical, response, in, the, indian, tradition, states, richman, the, social, value, is, that, a, warrior, must, never, harm, a, woman, the, details, of, the, response, by, rama, and, lakshmana, and, justifications, for, it, has, numerous, versions, similarly, there, are, numerous, and, very, different, versions, to, how, rama, deals, with, rumours, against, sita, when, they, return, victorious, to, ayodhya, given, that, the, rumours, can, neither, be, objectively, investigated, nor, summarily, ignored, similarly, the, versions, vary, on, many, other, specific, situations, and, closure, such, as, how, rama, sita, and, lakshmana, die, the, variation, and, inconsistencies, are, not, limited, to, the, texts, found, in, the, hinduism, traditions, the, rama, story, in, the, jain, tradition, also, show, variation, by, author, and, region, in, details, in, implied, ethical, prescriptions, and, even, in, names, the, older, versions, using, the, name, padma, instead, of, rama, while, the, later, jain, texts, just, use, rama, in, some, hindu, texts, rama, is, stated, to, have, lived, in, the, treta, yuga, that, their, authors, estimate, existed, before, about, 5000, bce, archaeologist, h, s, sankalia, who, specialised, in, proto, and, ancient, indian, history, find, such, estimate, to, be, pure, speculation, a, few, other, researchers, place, rama, to, have, more, plausibly, lived, around, 1250, bce, based, on, regnal, lists, of, kuru, and, vrishni, leaders, which, if, given, more, realistic, reign, lengths, would, place, bharat, and, satwata, contemporaries, of, rama, around, that, period, sankalia, dates, various, incidents, of, the, ramayana, to, have, taken, place, as, early, as, 1, 500, bce, the, composition, of, rama, s, epic, story, the, ramayana, in, its, current, form, is, usually, dated, between, 8th, and, 4th, century, bce, according, to, john, brockington, a, professor, of, sanskrit, at, oxford, known, for, his, publications, on, the, ramayana, the, original, text, was, likely, composed, and, transmitted, orally, in, more, ancient, times, and, modern, scholars, have, suggested, various, centuries, in, the, 1st, millennium, bce, in, brockington, s, view, based, on, the, language, style, and, content, of, the, work, a, date, of, roughly, the, fifth, century, bce, is, the, most, reasonable, estimate, historians, often, highlight, that, rama, s, narrative, reflects, not, only, religious, beliefs, but, also, societal, ideals, and, moral, principles, they, explore, the, possibility, of, rama, being, a, composite, figure, embodying, virtues, and, qualities, valued, in, ancient, indian, society, this, perspective, underscores, the, ramayana, s, role, as, both, a, religious, scripture, and, a, cultural, artifact, illustrating, how, legends, like, rama, s, have, shaped, india, s, collective, consciousness, and, ethical, frameworks, over, centuries, ariel, glucklich, about, this, quoted, rama, serve, not, only, as, historical, narratives, but, also, as, moral, and, spiritual, teachings, shaping, cultural, identity, and, religious, beliefs, in, profound, ways, rama, iconography, shares, elements, of, avatars, of, vishnu, but, has, several, distinctive, elements, he, has, two, hands, holds, a, bana, arrow, in, his, right, hand, while, he, holds, the, dhanus, bow, in, his, left, the, most, recommended, icon, for, him, is, that, he, be, shown, standing, in, tribhanga, pose, thrice, bent, s, shape, he, is, shown, black, blue, or, dark, color, typically, wearing, reddish, color, clothes, rama, is, often, accompanied, with, his, brother, lakshmana, on, his, left, side, while, his, consort, sita, always, on, his, right, both, of, golden, yellow, complexion, his, monkey, companion, hanuman, stands, nearby, with, folded, arms, the, group, can, be, accompanied, with, rama, s, brothers, bharata, and, shatrughna, too, who, is, rama, i, think, of, that, rama, who, lives, in, ayodhya, who, is, decorated, with, gems, who, sits, beneath, a, golden, canopy, whose, doorways, are, festooned, with, mandana, flowers, he, who, is, seated, on, a, throne, surrounded, by, celestial, vehicles, who, is, revered, by, rishis, who, has, sita, on, the, left, who, is, served, by, lakshmana, who, is, the, blue, complexioned, whose, face, is, tranquil, who, is, adorned, with, ornaments, rama, rahasya, upanishad, the, ramayana, describes, rama, as, a, charming, well, built, person, of, a, dark, complexion, var, am, y, mam, and, long, arms, j, nab, hu, meaning, a, person, whose, middle, finger, reaches, beyond, their, knee, in, the, sundara, kanda, section, of, the, epic, hanuman, describes, rama, to, sita, when, she, is, held, captive, in, lanka, to, prove, to, her, that, he, is, indeed, a, messenger, from, rama, he, says, he, has, broad, shoulders, mighty, arms, a, conch, shaped, neck, a, charming, countenance, and, coppery, eyes, he, has, his, clavicle, concealed, and, is, known, by, the, people, as, rama, he, has, a, voice, deep, like, the, sound, of, a, kettledrum, and, glossy, skin, is, full, of, glory, square, built, and, of, well, proportioned, limbs, and, is, endowed, with, a, dark, brown, complexion, rama, s, life, story, is, imbued, with, symbolism, according, to, sheldon, pollock, the, life, of, rama, as, told, in, the, indian, texts, is, a, masterpiece, that, offers, a, framework, to, represent, conceptualise, and, comprehend, the, world, and, the, nature, of, life, like, major, epics, and, religious, stories, around, the, world, it, has, been, of, vital, relevance, because, it, tells, the, culture, what, it, is, rama, s, life, is, more, complex, than, the, western, template, for, the, battle, between, the, good, and, the, evil, where, there, is, a, clear, distinction, between, immortal, powerful, gods, or, heroes, and, mortal, struggling, humans, in, the, indian, traditions, particularly, rama, the, story, is, about, a, divine, human, a, mortal, god, incorporating, both, into, the, exemplar, who, transcends, both, humans, and, gods, responding, to, evil, a, superior, being, does, not, render, evil, for, evil, this, is, the, maxim, one, should, observe, the, ornament, of, virtuous, persons, is, their, conduct, a, noble, soul, will, ever, exercise, compassion, even, towards, those, who, enjoy, injuring, others, ramayana, 6, 115, valmiki, abridged, translator, roderick, hindery, as, a, person, rama, personifies, the, characteristics, of, an, ideal, person, purushottama, he, had, within, him, all, the, desirable, virtues, that, any, individual, would, seek, to, aspire, and, he, fulfils, all, his, moral, obligations, rama, is, considered, a, maryada, purushottama, or, the, best, of, upholders, of, dharma, according, to, rodrick, hindery, book, 2, 6, and, 7, are, notable, for, ethical, studies, the, views, of, rama, combine, reason, with, emotions, to, create, a, thinking, hearts, approach, second, he, emphasises, through, what, he, says, and, what, he, does, a, union, of, self, consciousness, and, action, to, create, an, ethics, of, character, third, rama, s, life, combines, the, ethics, with, the, aesthetics, of, living, the, story, of, rama, and, people, in, his, life, raises, questions, such, as, is, it, appropriate, to, use, evil, to, respond, to, evil, and, then, provides, a, spectrum, of, views, within, the, framework, of, indian, beliefs, such, as, on, karma, and, dharma, rama,
