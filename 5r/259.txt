shinto, japanese, romanized, shint, is, a, religion, originating, in, japan, classified, as, an, east, asian, religion, by, scholars, of, religion, its, practitioners, often, regard, it, as, japan, s, indigenous, religion, and, as, a, nature, religion, scholars, sometimes, call, its, practitioners, shintoists, although, adherents, rarely, use, that, term, themselves, there, is, no, central, authority, in, control, of, shinto, with, much, diversity, of, belief, and, practice, evident, among, practitioners, a, polytheistic, and, animistic, religion, shinto, revolves, around, supernatural, entities, called, the, kami, the, kami, are, believed, to, inhabit, all, things, including, forces, of, nature, and, prominent, landscape, locations, the, kami, are, worshipped, at, kamidana, household, shrines, family, shrines, and, jinja, public, shrines, the, latter, are, staffed, by, priests, known, as, kannushi, who, oversee, offerings, of, food, and, drink, to, the, specific, kami, enshrined, at, that, location, this, is, done, to, cultivate, harmony, between, humans, and, kami, and, to, solicit, the, latter, s, blessing, other, common, rituals, include, the, kagura, dances, rites, of, passage, and, seasonal, festivals, public, shrines, facilitate, forms, of, divination, and, supply, religious, objects, such, as, amulets, to, the, religion, s, adherents, shinto, places, a, major, conceptual, focus, on, ensuring, purity, largely, by, cleaning, practices, such, as, ritual, washing, and, bathing, especially, before, worship, little, emphasis, is, placed, on, specific, moral, codes, or, particular, afterlife, beliefs, although, the, dead, are, deemed, capable, of, becoming, kami, the, religion, has, no, single, creator, or, specific, doctrine, and, instead, exists, in, a, diverse, range, of, local, and, regional, forms, although, historians, debate, at, what, point, it, is, suitable, to, refer, to, shinto, as, a, distinct, religion, kami, veneration, has, been, traced, back, to, japan, s, yayoi, period, 300, bc, to, 300, ad, buddhism, entered, japan, at, the, end, of, the, kofun, period, 300, to, 538, ad, and, spread, rapidly, religious, syncretization, made, kami, worship, and, buddhism, functionally, inseparable, a, process, called, shinbutsu, sh, g, the, kami, came, to, be, viewed, as, part, of, buddhist, cosmology, and, were, increasingly, depicted, anthropomorphically, the, earliest, written, tradition, regarding, kami, worship, was, recorded, in, the, 8th, century, kojiki, and, nihon, shoki, in, ensuing, centuries, shinbutsu, sh, g, was, adopted, by, japan, s, imperial, household, during, the, meiji, era, 1868, to, 1912, japan, s, nationalist, leadership, expelled, buddhist, influence, from, kami, worship, and, formed, state, shinto, which, some, historians, regard, as, the, origin, of, shinto, as, a, distinct, religion, shrines, came, under, growing, government, influence, and, citizens, were, encouraged, to, worship, the, emperor, as, a, kami, with, the, formation, of, the, japanese, empire, in, the, early, 20th, century, shinto, was, exported, to, other, areas, of, east, asia, following, japan, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, shinto, was, formally, separated, from, the, state, shinto, is, primarily, found, in, japan, where, there, are, around, 100, 000, public, shrines, although, practitioners, are, also, found, abroad, numerically, it, is, japan, s, largest, religion, the, second, being, buddhism, most, of, the, country, s, population, takes, part, in, both, shinto, and, buddhist, activities, especially, festivals, reflecting, a, common, view, in, japanese, culture, that, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, different, religions, need, not, be, exclusive, aspects, of, shinto, have, been, incorporated, into, various, japanese, new, religious, movements, there, is, no, universally, agreed, definition, of, shinto, however, the, authors, joseph, cali, and, john, dougill, stated, that, if, there, was, one, single, broad, definition, of, shinto, that, could, be, put, forward, it, would, be, that, shinto, is, a, belief, in, kami, the, supernatural, entities, at, the, centre, of, the, religion, the, japanologist, helen, hardacre, stated, that, shinto, encompasses, doctrines, institutions, ritual, and, communal, life, based, on, kami, worship, while, the, scholar, of, religion, inoue, nobutaka, observed, the, term, shinto, was, often, used, in, reference, to, kami, worship, and, related, theologies, rituals, and, practices, various, scholars, have, referred, to, practitioners, of, shinto, as, shintoists, although, this, term, has, no, direct, translation, in, the, japanese, language, scholars, have, debated, at, what, point, in, history, it, is, legitimate, to, start, talking, about, shinto, as, a, specific, phenomenon, the, scholar, of, religion, ninian, smart, suggested, that, one, could, speak, of, the, kami, religion, of, japan, which, lived, symbiotically, with, organized, buddhism, and, only, later, was, institutionalized, as, shinto, while, several, institutions, and, practices, now, associated, with, shinto, existed, in, japan, by, the, 8th, century, various, scholars, have, argued, that, shinto, as, a, distinct, religion, was, essentially, invented, during, the, 19th, century, in, japan, s, meiji, era, the, scholar, of, religion, brian, bocking, stressed, that, especially, when, dealing, with, periods, before, the, meiji, era, the, term, shinto, should, be, approached, with, caution, inoue, nobutaka, stated, that, shinto, cannot, be, considered, as, a, single, religious, system, that, existed, from, the, ancient, to, the, modern, period, while, the, historian, kuroda, toshio, noted, that, before, modern, times, shinto, did, not, exist, as, an, independent, religion, many, scholars, describe, shinto, as, a, religion, a, term, first, translated, into, japanese, as, sh, ky, around, the, time, of, the, meiji, restoration, some, practitioners, instead, view, shinto, as, a, way, thus, characterising, it, more, as, custom, or, tradition, partly, as, an, attempt, to, circumvent, the, modern, separation, of, religion, and, state, and, restore, shinto, s, historical, links, with, the, japanese, state, moreover, many, of, the, categories, of, religion, and, religiosity, defined, in, western, culture, do, not, readily, apply, to, shinto, unlike, religions, familiar, in, western, countries, such, as, christianity, and, islam, shinto, has, no, single, founder, nor, any, single, canonical, text, western, religions, tend, to, stress, exclusivity, but, in, japan, it, has, long, been, considered, acceptable, to, practice, different, religious, traditions, simultaneously, japanese, religion, is, therefore, highly, pluralistic, shinto, is, often, cited, alongside, buddhism, as, one, of, japan, s, two, main, religions, and, the, two, often, differ, in, focus, with, buddhism, emphasising, the, idea, of, transcending, the, cosmos, which, it, regards, as, being, replete, with, suffering, while, shinto, focuses, on, adapting, to, life, s, pragmatic, requirements, shinto, has, integrated, elements, from, religions, imported, from, mainland, asia, such, as, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, and, chinese, divination, practices, and, shares, features, like, its, polytheism, with, other, east, asian, religions, some, scholars, suggest, we, talk, about, types, of, shint, such, as, popular, shint, folk, shint, domestic, shint, sectarian, shint, imperial, house, shint, shrine, shint, state, shint, new, shint, religions, etc, rather, than, regard, shint, as, a, single, entity, this, approach, can, be, helpful, but, begs, the, question, of, what, is, meant, by, shint, in, each, case, particularly, since, each, category, incorporates, or, has, incorporated, buddhist, confucian, taoist, folk, religious, and, other, elements, scholar, of, religion, brian, bocking, scholars, of, religion, have, debated, how, to, classify, shinto, inoue, considered, it, part, of, the, family, of, east, asian, religions, the, philosopher, stuart, d, b, picken, suggested, that, shinto, be, classed, as, a, world, religion, while, the, historian, h, byron, earhart, called, it, a, major, religion, shinto, is, also, often, described, as, an, indigenous, religion, although, this, generates, debates, over, the, different, definitions, of, indigenous, in, the, japanese, context, the, notion, of, shinto, as, japan, s, indigenous, religion, stemmed, from, the, growth, of, modern, nationalism, between, the, edo, and, meiji, periods, this, view, promoted, the, idea, that, shinto, s, origins, were, prehistoric, and, that, it, represented, something, like, the, underlying, will, of, japanese, culture, the, prominent, shinto, theologian, sokyo, ono, for, instance, said, kami, worship, was, an, expression, of, the, japanese, native, racial, faith, which, arose, in, the, mystic, days, of, remote, antiquity, and, that, it, was, as, indigenous, as, the, people, that, brought, the, japanese, nation, into, existence, many, scholars, regard, this, classification, as, inaccurate, earhart, noted, that, shinto, in, having, absorbed, much, chinese, and, buddhist, influence, was, too, complex, to, be, labelled, simply, indigenous, religion, in, the, early, 21st, century, it, became, increasingly, common, for, practitioners, to, call, shinto, a, nature, religion, which, critics, saw, as, a, strategy, to, disassociate, the, tradition, from, controversial, issues, surrounding, militarism, and, imperialism, shinto, displays, substantial, local, variation, the, anthropologist, john, k, nelson, noted, it, was, not, a, unified, monolithic, entity, that, has, a, single, center, and, system, all, its, own, different, types, of, shinto, have, been, identified, shrine, shinto, refers, to, the, practices, centred, around, shrines, and, domestic, shinto, to, the, ways, in, which, kami, are, venerated, in, the, home, some, scholars, have, used, the, term, folk, shinto, to, designate, localised, shinto, practices, or, practices, outside, of, an, institutionalised, setting, in, various, eras, of, the, past, there, was, also, a, state, shinto, in, which, shinto, beliefs, and, practices, were, closely, interlinked, with, the, japanese, state, in, representing, a, portmanteau, term, for, many, varied, traditions, across, japan, the, term, shinto, is, similar, to, the, term, hinduism, used, to, describe, varied, traditions, across, south, asia, the, term, shinto, is, often, translated, into, english, as, the, way, of, the, kami, although, its, meaning, has, varied, throughout, japanese, history, other, terms, are, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, shinto, these, include, kami, no, michi, the, way, of, the, kami, kannagara, no, michi, also, written, or, the, way, of, the, kami, from, time, immemorial, kod, the, ancient, way, daid, the, great, way, and, teid, the, imperial, way, the, term, shinto, derives, from, the, combination, of, two, chinese, characters, shin, which, means, spirit, or, god, and, t, which, means, way, road, or, path, shint, the, way, of, the, gods, was, a, term, already, used, in, the, book, of, changes, referring, to, the, divine, order, of, nature, around, the, time, of, the, spread, of, buddhism, in, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce, it, was, used, to, distinguish, indigenous, chinese, religions, from, the, imported, religion, ge, hong, used, it, in, his, baopuzi, as, a, synonym, for, taoism, the, chinese, term, mc, zyin, daw, x, was, originally, adopted, into, japanese, as, jind, this, was, possibly, first, used, as, a, buddhist, term, to, refer, to, non, buddhist, deities, among, the, earliest, known, appearances, of, the, term, shinto, in, japan, is, in, the, 8th, century, text, nihon, shoki, here, it, may, be, a, generic, term, for, popular, belief, or, alternatively, reference, taoism, as, many, taoist, practices, had, recently, been, imported, from, mainland, asia, in, these, early, japanese, uses, the, word, shinto, did, not, apply, to, a, distinct, religious, tradition, nor, to, anything, uniquely, japanese, the, 11th, century, konjaku, monogatarishui, for, instance, refers, to, a, woman, in, china, practicing, shinto, and, also, to, people, in, india, worshipping, kami, indicating, these, terms, were, being, used, to, describe, religions, outside, japan, itself, in, medieval, japan, kami, worship, was, generally, seen, as, being, part, of, japanese, buddhism, with, the, kami, themselves, often, interpreted, as, buddhas, at, this, point, the, term, shinto, increasingly, referred, to, the, authority, power, or, activity, of, a, kami, being, a, kami, or, in, short, the, state, or, attributes, of, a, kami, it, appears, in, this, form, in, texts, such, as, nakatomi, no, harai, kunge, and, shint, sh, tales, in, the, japanese, portuguese, dictionary, of, 1603, shinto, is, defined, as, referring, to, kami, or, matters, pertaining, to, kami, the, term, shinto, became, common, in, the, 15th, century, during, the, late, edo, period, the, kokugaku, scholars, began, using, the, term, shinto, to, describe, what, they, believed, was, an, ancient, enduring, and, indigenous, japanese, tradition, that, predated, buddhism, they, argued, that, shinto, should, be, used, to, distinguish, kami, worship, from, traditions, like, buddhism, taoism, and, confucianism, this, use, of, the, term, shinto, became, increasingly, popular, from, the, 18th, century, the, term, shinto, has, been, commonly, used, only, since, the, early, 20th, century, when, it, superseded, the, term, taiky, great, religion, as, the, name, for, the, japanese, state, religion, shinto, is, polytheistic, involving, the, veneration, of, many, deities, known, as, kami, or, sometimes, as, jingi, in, japanese, no, distinction, is, made, here, between, singular, and, plural, and, hence, the, term, kami, refers, both, to, individual, kami, and, the, collective, group, of, kami, although, lacking, a, direct, english, translation, the, term, kami, has, sometimes, been, rendered, as, god, or, spirit, the, historian, of, religion, joseph, kitagawa, deemed, these, english, translations, quite, unsatisfactory, and, misleading, and, various, scholars, urge, against, translating, kami, into, english, in, japanese, it, is, often, said, that, there, are, eight, million, kami, a, term, which, connotes, an, infinite, number, and, shinto, practitioners, believe, that, they, are, present, everywhere, they, are, not, regarded, as, omnipotent, omniscient, or, necessarily, immortal, the, term, kami, is, conceptually, fluid, being, vague, and, imprecise, in, japanese, it, is, often, applied, to, the, power, of, phenomena, that, inspire, a, sense, of, wonder, and, awe, in, the, beholder, kitagawa, referred, to, this, as, the, kami, nature, stating, that, he, thought, it, somewhat, analogous, to, the, western, ideas, of, the, numinous, and, the, sacred, kami, are, seen, to, inhabit, both, the, living, and, the, dead, organic, and, inorganic, matter, and, natural, disasters, like, earthquakes, droughts, and, plagues, their, presence, is, seen, in, natural, forces, such, as, the, wind, rain, fire, and, sunshine, accordingly, nelson, commented, that, shinto, regards, the, actual, phenomena, of, the, world, itself, as, being, divine, this, perspective, has, been, characterised, as, being, animistic, in, japan, kami, have, been, venerated, since, prehistory, during, the, yayoi, period, they, were, regarded, as, being, formless, and, invisible, later, coming, to, be, depicted, anthropomorphically, under, buddhist, influence, now, statues, of, the, kami, are, known, as, shinzo, kami, are, usually, associated, with, a, specific, place, often, a, prominent, landscape, feature, such, as, a, waterfall, mountain, large, rock, or, distinctive, tree, physical, objects, or, places, in, which, the, kami, are, believed, to, have, a, presence, are, termed, shintai, objects, inhabited, by, the, kami, that, are, placed, in, the, shrine, are, known, as, go, shintai, objects, commonly, chosen, for, this, purpose, include, mirrors, swords, stones, beads, and, inscribed, tablets, these, go, shintai, are, concealed, from, the, view, of, visitors, and, may, be, hidden, inside, boxes, so, that, even, the, priests, do, not, know, what, they, look, like, kami, are, deemed, capable, of, both, benevolent, and, destructive, deeds, if, warnings, about, good, conduct, are, ignored, the, kami, can, mete, out, punishment, often, illness, or, sudden, death, called, shinbatsu, some, kami, referred, to, as, the, magatsuhi, no, kami, or, araburu, kami, are, regarded, as, malevolent, and, destructive, offerings, and, prayers, are, given, to, the, kami, to, gain, their, blessings, and, to, dissuade, them, from, destructive, actions, shinto, seeks, to, cultivate, and, ensure, a, harmonious, relationship, between, humans, and, the, kami, and, thus, with, the, natural, world, more, localised, kami, may, be, subject, to, feelings, of, intimacy, and, familiarity, from, members, of, the, local, community, that, are, not, directed, towards, more, widespread, kami, like, amaterasu, the, kami, of, a, particular, community, is, referred, to, it, as, their, ujigami, while, that, of, a, particular, house, is, the, yashikigami, kami, are, not, deemed, metaphysically, different, from, humanity, with, it, being, possible, for, humans, to, become, kami, dead, humans, are, sometimes, venerated, as, kami, being, regarded, as, protector, or, ancestral, figures, one, of, the, most, prominent, examples, is, that, of, the, emperor, jin, who, on, his, death, was, enshrined, as, the, kami, hachiman, believed, to, be, a, protector, of, japan, and, a, kami, of, war, in, japanese, culture, ancestors, can, be, viewed, as, a, form, of, kami, in, western, japan, the, term, jigami, is, used, to, describe, the, enshrined, kami, of, a, village, founder, in, some, cases, living, human, beings, were, also, viewed, as, kami, these, were, called, akitsumi, kami, or, arahito, gami, in, the, state, shinto, system, of, the, meiji, era, the, emperor, of, japan, was, declared, to, be, a, kami, while, several, shinto, sects, have, also, viewed, their, leaders, as, living, kami, although, some, kami, are, venerated, only, in, a, single, location, others, have, shrines, across, many, areas, hachiman, for, instance, has, around, 25, 000, shrines, dedicated, to, him, while, inari, has, 40, 000, the, act, of, establishing, a, new, shrine, to, a, kami, who, already, has, one, is, called, bunrei, dividing, the, spirit, as, part, of, this, the, kami, is, invited, to, enter, a, new, place, with, the, instalment, ceremony, known, as, a, kanjo, the, new, subsidiary, shrine, is, known, as, a, bunsha, individual, kami, are, not, believed, to, have, their, power, diminished, by, their, residence, in, multiple, locations, and, there, is, no, limit, on, the, number, of, places, a, kami, can, be, enshrined, in, some, periods, fees, were, charged, for, the, right, to, enshrine, a, particular, kami, in, a, new, place, shrines, are, not, necessarily, always, designed, as, permanent, structures, many, kami, have, messengers, known, as, kami, no, tsukai, or, tsuka, washime, that, generally, take, animal, forms, inari, s, messenger, for, example, is, a, fox, kitsune, while, hachiman, s, is, a, dove, shinto, cosmology, also, includes, spirits, who, cause, malevolent, acts, bakemono, a, category, including, oni, tengu, kappa, mononoke, and, yamanba, japanese, folklore, also, incorporates, belief, in, the, gory, or, onry, unquiet, or, vengeful, spirits, particularly, of, those, who, died, violently, and, without, appropriate, funerary, rites, these, are, believed, to, inflict, suffering, on, the, living, meaning, that, they, must, be, pacified, usually, through, buddhist, rites, but, sometimes, through, enshrining, them, as, a, kami, other, japanese, supernatural, figures, include, the, tanuki, animal, like, creatures, who, can, take, human, form, although, the, narratives, differ, in, detail, the, origin, of, the, kami, and, of, japan, itself, are, recounted, in, two, 8th, century, texts, kojiki, and, nihon, shoki, drawing, heavily, on, chinese, influence, these, texts, were, commissioned, by, ruling, elites, to, legitimize, and, consolidate, their, rule, although, never, of, great, importance, to, japanese, religious, life, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, government, proclaimed, that, their, accounts, were, factual, the, kojiki, recounts, that, the, universe, started, with, ame, tsuchi, the, separation, of, light, and, pure, elements, ame, heaven, from, heavy, elements, tsuchi, earth, three, kami, then, appeared, amenominakanushi, takamimusuhi, no, mikoto, and, kamimusuhi, no, mikoto, other, kami, followed, including, a, brother, and, sister, izanagi, and, izanami, the, kami, instructed, izanagi, and, izanami, to, create, land, on, earth, to, this, end, the, siblings, stirred, the, briny, sea, with, a, jewelled, spear, from, which, onogoro, island, was, formed, izanagi, and, izanami, then, descended, to, earth, where, the, latter, gave, birth, to, further, kami, one, of, these, was, a, fire, kami, whose, birth, killed, izanami, izanagi, descended, to, yomi, to, retrieve, his, sister, but, there, he, saw, her, body, putrefying, embarrassed, to, be, seen, in, this, state, she, chased, him, out, of, yomi, and, he, closed, its, entrance, with, a, boulder, izanagi, bathed, in, the, sea, to, rid, himself, from, the, pollution, brought, about, by, witnessing, izanami, s, putrefaction, through, this, act, further, kami, emerged, from, his, body, amaterasu, the, sun, kami, was, born, from, his, left, eye, tsukuyomi, the, moon, kami, from, his, right, eye, and, susanoo, the, storm, kami, from, his, nose, susanoo, behaved, in, a, destructive, manner, to, escape, him, amaterasu, hid, herself, within, a, cave, plunging, the, earth, into, darkness, the, other, kami, eventually, succeeded, in, coaxing, her, out, susanoo, was, then, banished, to, earth, where, he, married, and, had, children, according, to, the, kojiki, amaterasu, then, sent, her, grandson, ninigi, to, rule, japan, giving, him, curved, beads, a, mirror, and, a, sword, the, symbols, of, japanese, imperial, authority, amaterasu, remains, probably, japan, s, most, venerated, kami, in, shinto, the, creative, principle, permeating, all, life, is, known, as, musubi, and, is, associated, with, its, own, kami, within, traditional, japanese, thought, there, is, no, concept, of, an, overarching, duality, between, good, and, evil, the, concept, of, aki, encompasses, misfortune, unhappiness, and, disaster, although, it, does, not, correspond, precisely, with, the, western, concept, of, evil, there, is, no, eschatology, in, shinto, texts, such, as, the, kojiki, and, nihon, shoki, portray, multiple, realms, in, shinto, cosmology, these, present, a, universe, divided, into, three, parts, the, plane, of, high, heaven, takama, no, hara, where, the, kami, live, the, phenomenal, or, manifested, world, utsushi, yo, where, humans, dwell, and, the, nether, world, yomotsu, kuni, where, unclean, spirits, reside, the, mythological, texts, nevertheless, do, not, draw, firm, demarcations, between, these, realms, modern, shinto, places, greater, emphasis, on, this, life, than, on, any, afterlife, although, it, does, espouse, belief, in, a, human, spirit, or, soul, the, mitama, or, tamashii, which, contains, four, aspects, while, indigenous, ideas, about, an, afterlife, were, probably, well, developed, prior, to, buddhism, s, arrival, contemporary, japanese, people, often, adopt, buddhist, afterlife, beliefs, mythological, stories, like, the, kojiki, describe, yomi, or, yomi, no, kuni, as, a, realm, of, the, dead, although, this, plays, no, role, in, modern, shinto, modern, shinto, ideas, about, the, afterlife, largely, revolve, around, the, idea, that, the, spirit, survives, bodily, death, and, continues, to, assist, the, living, after, 33, years, it, then, becomes, part, of, the, family, kami, these, ancestral, spirits, are, sometimes, thought, to, reside, in, the, mountains, from, where, they, descend, to, take, part, in, agricultural, events, shinto, s, afterlife, beliefs, also, include, the, obake, restless, spirits, who, died, in, bad, circumstances, and, often, seek, revenge, a, key, theme, in, shinto, is, the, avoidance, of, kegare, pollution, or, impurity, while, ensuring, harae, purity, in, japanese, thought, humans, are, seen, as, fundamentally, pure, kegare, is, therefore, seen, as, being, a, temporary, condition, that, can, be, corrected, through, achieving, harae, rites, of, purification, are, conducted, so, as, to, restore, an, individual, to, spiritual, health, and, render, them, useful, to, society, this, notion, of, purity, is, present, in, many, facets, of, japanese, culture, such, as, the, focus, it, places, on, bathing, purification, is, for, instance, regarded, as, important, in, preparation, for, the, planting, season, while, performers, of, noh, theatre, undergo, a, purification, rite, before, they, carry, out, their, performances, among, the, things, regarded, as, particular, pollutants, in, shinto, are, death, disease, witchcraft, the, flaying, alive, of, an, animal, incest, bestiality, excrement, and, blood, associated, with, either, menstruation, or, childbirth, to, avoid, kegare, priests, and, other, practitioners, may, engage, in, abstinence, and, avoid, various, activities, prior, to, a, festival, or, ritual, various, words, termed, imi, kotoba, are, also, regarded, as, taboo, and, people, avoid, speaking, them, when, at, a, shrine, these, include, shi, death, by, illness, and, shishi, meat, a, purification, ceremony, known, as, misogi, involves, the, use, of, fresh, water, salt, water, or, salt, to, remove, kegare, full, immersion, in, the, sea, is,

of, funerals, conducted, through, shinto, rites, the, earliest, examples, are, known, from, the, mid, 17th, century, these, occurred, in, certain, areas, of, japan, and, had, the, support, of, the, local, authorities, following, the, meiji, restoration, in, 1868, the, government, recognised, specifically, shinto, funerals, for, shinto, priests, five, years, later, this, was, extended, to, cover, the, entire, japanese, population, despite, this, meiji, promotion, of, shinto, funerals, the, majority, of, the, population, continued, to, have, buddhist, funeral, rites, in, recent, decades, shinto, funerals, have, usually, been, reserved, for, shinto, priests, and, for, members, of, certain, shinto, sects, after, cremation, the, normal, funerary, process, in, japan, the, ashes, of, a, priest, may, be, interred, near, to, the, shrine, but, not, inside, its, precincts, ancestral, reverence, remains, an, important, part, of, japanese, religious, custom, the, invocation, of, the, dead, and, especially, the, war, dead, is, known, as, sh, kon, various, rites, reference, this, for, instance, at, the, largely, buddhist, festival, of, bon, the, souls, of, the, ancestors, are, believed, to, visit, the, living, and, are, then, sent, away, in, a, ritual, called, sh, r, nagashi, by, which, lanterns, are, inserted, into, small, boats, often, made, of, paper, and, placed, in, a, river, to, float, downstream, shinto, practitioners, believe, that, the, kami, can, possess, a, human, being, and, then, speak, through, them, a, process, known, as, kami, gakari, several, new, religious, movements, drawing, upon, shinto, such, as, tenrikyo, and, oomoto, were, founded, by, individuals, claiming, to, be, guided, by, a, possessing, kami, the, takusen, is, an, oracle, that, is, passed, from, the, kami, via, the, medium, the, itako, and, ichiko, are, blind, women, who, train, to, become, spiritual, mediums, traditionally, in, japan, s, northern, tohoku, region, itako, train, under, other, itako, from, childhood, memorialising, sacred, texts, and, prayers, fasting, and, undertaking, acts, of, severe, asceticism, through, which, they, are, believed, to, cultivate, supernatural, powers, in, an, initiation, ceremony, a, kami, is, believed, to, possess, the, young, woman, and, the, two, are, then, ritually, married, after, this, the, kami, becomes, her, tutelary, spirit, and, she, will, henceforth, be, able, to, call, upon, it, and, a, range, of, other, spirits, in, the, future, through, contacting, these, spirits, she, is, able, to, convey, their, messages, to, the,

invoking, both, kami, and, buddhas, earhart, commented, that, shinto, ultimately, emerged, from, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, prehistoric, japan, although, kitagawa, noted, that, it, was, questionable, whether, prehistoric, japanese, religions, could, be, accurately, termed, early, shinto, it, was, the, yayoi, period, of, japanese, prehistory, which, first, left, traces, of, material, and, iconography, prefiguring, that, later, included, in, shinto, kami, were, worshipped, at, various, landscape, features, during, this, period, at, this, point, their, worship, consisted, largely, of, beseeching, and, placating, them, with, little, evidence, that, they, were, viewed, as, compassionate, entities, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, dotaku, bronze, bells, bronze, weapons, and, metal, mirrors, played, an, important, role, in, kami, based, ritual, during, the, yayoi, period, in, this, early, period, japan, was, not, a, unified, state, by, the, kofun, period, it, was, divided, among, uji, clans, each, with, their, own, tutelary, kami, the, ujigami, korean, migration, during, the, kofun, period, brought, confucianism, and, buddhism, to, japan, buddhism, had, a, particular, impact, on, the, kami, cults, migrant, groups, and, japanese, who, increasingly, aligned, with, these, foreign, influences, built, buddhist, temples, in, various, parts, of, the, japanese, islands, several, rival, clans, who, were, more, hostile, to, these, foreign, influences, began, adapting, the, shrines, of, their, kami, to, more, closely, resemble, the, new, buddhist, structures, in, the, late, 5th, century, the, imperial, dynasty, leader, y, ryaku, declared, himself, dai, great, king, and, established, hegemony, over, much, of, japan, from, the, early, 6th, century, ce, the, style, of, ritual, favored, by, the, yamato, began, spreading, to, other, kami, shrines, around, japan, as, the, yamato, extended, their, territorial, influence, buddhism, was, also, growing, according, to, the, nihon, shoki, in, 587, emperor, y, mei, converted, to, buddhism, and, under, his, sponsorship, buddhism, spread, in, the, mid, 7th, century, a, legal, code, called, ritsury, was, adopted, to, establish, a, chinese, style, centralised, government, as, part, of, this, the, jingikan, council, of, kami, was, created, to, conduct, rites, of, state, and, coordinate, provincial, ritual, with, that, in, the, capital, this, was, done, according, to, a, code, of, kami, law, called, the, jingiry, itself, modelled, on, the, chinese, book, of, rites, the, jingikan, was, located, in, the, palace, precincts, and, maintained, a, register, of, shrines, and, priests, an, annual, calendar, of, state, rites, were, introduced, to, help, unify, japan, through, kami, worship, these, legally, mandated, rites, were, outlined, in, the, y, r, code, of, 718, and, expanded, in, the, jogan, gishiki, of, circa, 872, and, the, engi, shiki, of, 927, under, the, jingikan, some, shrines, were, designated, as, kansha, official, shrines, and, given, specific, privileges, and, responsibilities, hardacre, saw, the, jingikan, as, the, institutional, origin, of, shinto, in, the, early, 8th, century, the, emperor, tenmu, commissioned, a, compilation, of, the, legends, and, genealogies, of, japan, s, clans, resulting, in, the, completion, of, the, kojiki, in, 712, designed, to, legitimate, the, ruling, dynasty, this, text, created, a, fixed, version, of, various, stories, previously, circulating, in, oral, tradition, the, kojiki, omits, any, reference, to, buddhism, in, part, because, it, sought, to, ignore, foreign, influences, and, emphasise, a, narrative, stressing, indigenous, elements, of, japanese, culture, several, years, later, the, nihon, shoki, was, written, unlike, the, kojiki, this, made, various, references, to, buddhism, and, was, aimed, at, a, foreign, audience, both, of, these, texts, sought, to, establish, the, imperial, clan, s, descent, from, the, sun, kami, amaterasu, although, there, were, many, differences, in, the, cosmogonic, narrative, they, provided, quickly, the, nihon, shoki, eclipsed, the, kojiki, in, terms, of, its, influence, other, texts, written, at, this, time, also, drew, on, oral, traditions, regarding, the, kami, the, sendari, kuji, hongi, for, example, was, probably, composed, by, the, mononobe, clan, while, the, kogoshui, was, probably, put, together, for, the, imbe, clan, and, in, both, cases, they, were, designed, to, highlight, the, divine, origins, of, these, respective, lineages, a, government, order, in, 713, called, on, each, region, to, produce, fudoki, records, of, local, geography, products, and, stories, with, the, latter, revealing, more, traditions, about, the, kami, which, were, present, at, this, time, from, the, 8th, century, kami, worship, and, buddhism, were, thoroughly, intertwined, in, japanese, society, while, the, emperor, and, court, performed, buddhist, rites, they, also, performed, others, to, honor, the, kami, tenmu, for, example, appointed, a, virginal, imperial, princess, to, serve, as, the, sai, a, form, of, priestess, at, the, ise, shrine, on, his, behalf, a, tradition, continued, by, subsequent, emperors, from, the, 8th, century, onward, up, until, the, meiji, era, the, kami, were, incorporated, into, a, buddhist, cosmology, in, various, ways, one, view, is, that, the, kami, realised, that, like, all, other, life, forms, they, too, were, trapped, in, the, cycle, of, samsara, rebirth, and, that, to, escape, this, they, had, to, follow, buddhist, teachings, alternative, approaches, viewed, the, kami, as, benevolent, entities, who, protected, buddhism, or, that, the, kami, were, themselves, buddhas, or, beings, who, had, achieved, enlightenment, in, this, they, could, be, either, hongaku, the, pure, spirits, of, the, buddhas, or, honji, suijaku, transformations, of, the, buddhas, in, their, attempt, to, help, all, sentient, beings, this, period, hosted, many, changes, to, the, country, government, and, religion, the, capital, is, moved, again, to, heij, ky, modern, day, nara, in, ad, 710, by, empress, genmei, due, to, the, death, of, the, emperor, this, practice, was, necessary, due, to, the, shinto, belief, in, the, impurity, of, death, and, the, need, to, avoid, this, pollution, however, this, practice, of, moving, the, capital, due, to, death, impurity, is, then, abolished, by, the, taih, code, and, rise, in, buddhist, influence, the, establishment, of, the, imperial, city, in, partnership, with, taih, code, is, important, to, shinto, as, the, office, of, the, shinto, rites, becomes, more, powerful, in, assimilating, local, clan, shrines, into, the, imperial, fold, new, shrines, are, built, and, assimilated, each, time, the, city, is, moved, all, of, the, grand, shrines, are, regulated, under, taih, and, are, required, to, account, for, incomes, priests, and, practices, due, to, their, national, contributions, breen, and, teeuwen, characterise, the, period, between, 1868, and, 1915, during, the, meiji, era, as, being, the, formative, years, of, modern, shinto, it, is, in, this, period, that, various, scholars, have, argued, that, shinto, was, essentially, invented, fridell, argues, that, scholars, call, the, period, from, 1868, to, 1945, the, state, shinto, period, because, during, these, decades, shinto, elements, came, under, a, great, deal, of, overt, state, influence, and, control, as, the, japanese, government, systematically, utilized, shrine, worship, as, a, major, force, for, mobilizing, imperial, loyalties, on, behalf, of, modern, nation, building, however, the, government, had, already, been, treating, shrines, as, an, extension, of, government, before, meiji, see, for, example, the, tenp, reforms, moreover, according, to, the, scholar, jason, nanda, josephson, it, is, inaccurate, to, describe, shrines, as, constituting, a, state, religion, or, a, theocracy, during, this, period, since, they, had, neither, organization, nor, doctrine, and, were, uninterested, in, conversion, the, meiji, restoration, of, 1868, was, fuelled, by, a, renewal, of, confucian, ethics, and, imperial, patriotism, among, japan, s, ruling, class, among, these, reformers, buddhism, was, seen, as, a, corrupting, influence, that, had, undermined, what, they, envisioned, as, japan, s, original, purity, and, greatness, they, wanted, to, place, a, renewed, emphasis, on, kami, worship, as, an, indigenous, form, of, ritual, an, attitude, that, was, also, fuelled, by, anxieties, about, western, expansionism, and, fear, that, christianity, would, take, hold, in, japan, in, 1868, all, shrine, priests, were, placed, under, the, authority, of, the, new, jingikan, or, council, of, kami, affairs, a, project, of, forcibly, separating, kami, worship, from, buddhism, was, implemented, with, buddhist, monks, deities, buildings, and, rituals, banned, from, kami, shrines, much, buddhist, material, was, destroyed, in, 1871, a, new, hierarchy, of, shrines, was, introduced, with, imperial, and, national, shrines, at, the, top, hereditary, priesthoods, were, abolished, and, a, new, state, sanctioned, system, for, appointing, priests, was, introduced, in, 1872, the, jingikan, was, replaced, with, the, kyobusho, or, ministry, of, edification, this, coordinated, a, campaign, whereby, kyodoshoku, national, evangelists, were, sent, through, the, country, to, promote, japan, s, great, teaching, which, included, respect, for, the, kami, and, obedience, to, the, emperor, this, campaign, was, discontinued, in, 1884, in, 1906, thousands, of, village, shrines, were, merged, so, that, most, small, communities, had, only, a, single, shrine, where, rites, in, honor, of, the, emperor, could, be, held, shinto, effectively, became, the, state, cult, one, promoted, with, growing, zeal, in, the, build, up, to, the, second, world, war, in, 1882, the, meiji, government, designated, 13, religious, movements, that, were, neither, buddhist, nor, christian, to, be, forms, of, sect, shinto, the, number, and, name, of, the, sects, given, this, formal, designation, varied, often, they, merged, ideas, with, shinto, from, buddhism, christian, confucian, daoist, and, western, esoteric, traditions, in, the, meiji, period, many, local, traditions, died, out, and, were, replaced, by, nationally, standardised, practices, encouraged, from, tokyo, during, the, u, s, occupation, a, new, japanese, constitution, was, drawn, up, this, enshrined, freedom, of, religion, and, separated, religion, from, the, state, a, measure, designed, to, eradicate, state, shinto, the, emperor, declared, that, he, was, not, a, kami, shinto, rituals, performed, by, the, imperial, family, became, their, own, private, affair, this, disestablishment, ended, government, subsidies, to, shrines, and, gave, them, renewed, freedom, to, organise, their, own, affairs, in, 1946, many, shrines, formed, a, voluntary, organisation, the, association, of, shinto, shrines, jinja, honch, in, 1956, the, association, issued, a, creedal, statement, the, keishin, seikatsu, no, k, ry, general, characteristics, of, a, life, lived, in, reverence, of, the, kami, to, summarise, what, they, regarded, as, shinto, s, principles, by, the, late, 1990s, around, 80, of, japan, s, shinto, shrines, were, part, of, this, association, in, the, post, war, decades, many, japanese, blamed, shinto, for, encouraging, the, militarism, which, had, led, to, defeat, and, occupation, others, remained, nostalgic, for, state, shinto, and, concerns, were, repeatedly, expressed, that, sectors, of, japanese, society, were, conspiring, to, restore, it, various, legal, debates, revolved, around, the, involvement, of, public, officials, in, shinto, in, 1965, for, instance, the, city, of, tsu, mie, prefecture, paid, four, shinto, priests, to, purify, the, site, where, the, municipal, athletic, hall, was, to, be, built, critics, brought, the, case, to, court, claiming, it, contravened, the, constitutional, separation, of, religion, and, state, in, 1971, the, high, court, ruled, that, the, city, administration, s, act, had, been,
