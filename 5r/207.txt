the, 1054, schism, was, the, culmination, of, mounting, theological, political, and, cultural, disputes, particularly, over, the, authority, of, the, pope, between, those, churches, before, the, council, of, ephesus, in, ad, 431, the, church, of, the, east, also, shared, in, this, communion, as, did, the, various, oriental, orthodox, churches, before, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, ad, 451,

which, recognise, the, seven, ecumenical, councils, and, usually, are, in, communion, with, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, the, patriarchate, of, alexandria, the, patriarchate, of, antioch, and, the, patriarchate, of, jerusalem, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, are, defined, positively, by, their, adherence, to, the, dogmatic, definitions, of, the, seven, councils, by, the, strong, sense, of, not, being, a, sect, or, a, denomination, but, simply, continuing, the, christian, church, and, despite, their, varied, origins, by, adherence, to, the, byzantine, rite, those, churches, are,

orthodoxy, it, is, practised, by, a, vicariate, of, the, antiochian, orthodox, church, in, keeping, with, the, church, s, teaching, on, universality, and, with, the, nicene, creed, eastern, orthodox, authorities, such, as, raphael, of, brooklyn, have, insisted, that, the, full, name, of, the, church, has, always, included, the, term, catholic, as, in, holy, orthodox, catholic, apostolic, church, the, official, name, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, is, the, orthodox, catholic, church, it, is, the, name, by, which, the, church, refers, to, itself, and, which, is, issued, in, its, liturgical, or, canonical, texts, eastern, orthodox, theologians, refer, to, the, church, as, catholic, this, name, and, longer, variants, containing, catholic, are, also, recognised, and, referenced, in, other, books, and, publications, by, secular, or, non, eastern, orthodox, writers, the, catechism, of, philaret, drozdov, of, moscow, published, in, the, 19th, century, is, titled, the, longer, catechism, of, the, orthodox, catholic, eastern, church, russian, from, ancient, times, through, the, first, millennium, greek, was, the, most, prevalent, shared, language, in, the, demographic, regions, where, the, byzantine, empire, flourished, and, greek, being, the, language, in, which, the, new, testament, was, written, was, the, primary, liturgical, language, of, the, church, for, this, reason, the, eastern, churches, were, sometimes, identified, as, greek, in, contrast, to, the, roman, or, latin, church, which, used, a, latin, translation, of, the, bible, even, before, the, great, schism, of, 1054, after, 1054, greek, orthodox, or, greek, catholic, marked, a, church, as, being, in, communion, with, constantinople, much, as, catholic, did, for, communion, with, the, catholic, church, in, hungarian, the, church, is, still, commonly, called, eastern, greek, hungarian, g, r, gkeleti, this, identification, with, greek, however, became, increasingly, confusing, with, time, missionaries, brought, eastern, orthodoxy, to, many, regions, without, ethnic, greeks, where, the, greek, language, was, not, spoken, in, addition, struggles, between, rome, and, constantinople, to, control, parts, of, southeastern, europe, resulted, in, the, conversion, of, some, churches, to, the, catholic, church, which, then, also, used, greek, catholic, to, indicate, their, continued, use, of, the, byzantine, rites, today, only, a, minority, of, eastern, orthodox, adherents, use, greek, as, the, language, of, worship, eastern, then, indicates, the, geographical, element, in, the, church, s, origin, and, development, while, orthodox, indicates, the, faith, as, well, as, communion, with, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, there, are, additional, christian, churches, in, the, east, that, are, in, communion, with, neither, the, catholic, church, nor, the, eastern, orthodox, church, who, tend, to, be, distinguished, by, the, category, named, oriental, orthodox, while, the, eastern, orthodox, church, continues, officially, to, call, itself, catholic, for, reasons, of, universality, the, common, title, of, eastern, orthodox, church, avoids, casual, confusion, with, the, catholic, church, the, first, known, use, of, the, phrase, the, catholic, church, he, katholike, ekklesia, occurred, in, a, letter, written, about, ad, 110, from, one, greek, church, to, another, ignatius, of, antioch, to, the, smyrnaeans, the, letter, states, wheresoever, the, bishop, shall, appear, there, let, the, people, be, even, as, where, jesus, may, be, there, is, the, universal, church, thus, almost, from, the, beginning, christians, referred, to, the, christian, church, as, the, one, holy, catholic, from, the, greek, according, to, the, whole, universal, and, apostolic, church, the, eastern, orthodox, church, claims, that, it, is, today, the, continuation, and, preservation, of, that, same, early, church, a, number, of, other, christian, churches, also, make, a, similar, claim, the, roman, catholic, church, the, anglican, communion, the, assyrian, church, and, the, oriental, orthodox, in, the, eastern, orthodox, view, the, assyrians, and, orientals, left, the, orthodox, church, in, the, years, following, the, third, ecumenical, council, of, ephesus, 431, and, the, fourth, ecumenical, council, of, chalcedon, 451, respectively, in, their, refusal, to, accept, those, councils, christological, definitions, similarly, the, churches, in, rome, and, constantinople, separated, in, an, event, known, as, the, east, west, schism, traditionally, dated, to, the, year, 1054, although, it, was, more, a, gradual, process, than, a, sudden, break, to, all, these, churches, the, claim, to, catholicity, universality, oneness, with, the, ancient, church, is, important, for, multiple, doctrinal, reasons, that, have, more, bearing, internally, in, each, church, than, in, their, relation, to, the, others, now, separated, in, faith, the, meaning, of, holding, to, a, faith, that, is, true, is, the, primary, reason, why, anyone, s, statement, of, which, church, split, off, from, which, other, has, any, significance, at, all, the, issues, go, as, deep, as, the, schisms, the, depth, of, this, meaning, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, is, registered, first, in, its, use, of, the, word, orthodox, itself, a, union, of, greek, orthos, straight, correct, true, right, and, doxa, common, belief, from, the, ancient, verb, which, is, translated, to, believe, to, think, to, consider, to, imagine, to, assume, the, dual, meanings, of, doxa, with, glory, or, glorification, of, god, by, the, church, and, of, the, church, by, god, especially, in, worship, yield, the, pair, correct, belief, and, true, worship, together, these, express, the, core, of, a, fundamental, teaching, about, the, inseparability, of, belief, and, worship, and, their, role, in, drawing, the, church, together, with, christ, all, slavic, churches, use, the, title, pravoslavie, cyrillic, meaning, correctness, of, glorification, to, denote, what, is, in, english, orthodoxy, while, the, georgians, use, the, title, martlmadidebeli, the, term, eastern, church, the, geographic, east, in, the, east, west, schism, has, been, used, to, distinguish, it, from, western, christendom, the, geographic, west, which, at, first, came, to, designate, the, catholic, communion, later, also, the, various, protestant, and, anglican, branches, eastern, is, used, to, indicate, that, the, highest, concentrations, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, presence, remain, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, christian, world, although, it, is, growing, worldwide, orthodox, christians, throughout, the, world, use, various, ethnic, or, national, jurisdictional, titles, or, more, inclusively, the, title, eastern, orthodox, orthodox, catholic, or, simply, orthodox, what, unites, orthodox, christians, is, the, catholic, faith, as, carried, through, holy, tradition, that, faith, is, expressed, most, fundamentally, in, scripture, and, worship, and, the, latter, most, essentially, through, baptism, and, in, the, divine, liturgy, the, lines, of, even, this, test, can, blur, however, when, differences, that, arise, are, not, due, to, doctrine, but, to, recognition, of, jurisdiction, as, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, spread, into, the, west, and, over, the, world, the, church, as, a, whole, has, yet, to, sort, out, all, the, inter, jurisdictional, issues, that, have, arisen, in, the, expansion, leaving, some, areas, of, doubt, about, what, is, proper, church, governance, moreover, as, in, the, ancient, church, persecutions, the, aftermath, of, persecutions, of, christians, in, communist, nations, has, complicated, some, issues, of, governance, that, have, yet, to, be, completely, resolved, all, members, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, profess, the, same, faith, regardless, of, race, or, nationality, jurisdiction, or, local, custom, or, century, of, birth, holy, tradition, encompasses, the, understandings, and, means, by, which, that, unity, of, faith, is, transmitted, across, boundaries, of, time, geography, and, culture, it, is, a, continuity, that, exists, only, inasmuch, as, it, lives, within, christians, themselves, it, is, not, static, nor, an, observation, of, rules, but, rather, a, sharing, of, observations, that, spring, both, from, within, and, also, in, keeping, with, others, even, others, who, lived, lives, long, past, the, church, proclaims, the, holy, spirit, maintains, the, unity, and, consistency, of, holy, tradition, to, preserve, the, integrity, of, the, faith, within, the, church, as, given, in, the, scriptural, promises, orthodoxy, asserts, that, its, shared, beliefs, and, its, theology, exist, within, holy, tradition, and, cannot, be, separated, from, it, and, that, their, meaning, is, not, expressed, in, mere, words, alone, that, doctrine, cannot, be, understood, unless, it, is, prayed, and, that, it, must, also, be, lived, in, order, to, be, prayed, that, without, action, the, prayer, is, idle, empty, and, in, vain, and, therefore, the, theology, of, demons, the, eastern, orthodox, church, considers, itself, to, be, both, orthodox, and, catholic, the, doctrine, of, the, catholicity, of, the, church, as, derived, from, the, nicene, creed, is, essential, to, eastern, orthodox, ecclesiology, the, term, catholicity, of, the, church, greek, is, used, in, its, original, sense, as, a, designation, for, the, universality, of, the, christian, church, centred, around, christ, therefore, the, eastern, orthodox, notion, of, catholicity, is, not, centred, around, any, singular, see, unlike, the, catholic, church, which, has, one, earthly, centre, due, to, the, influence, of, the, catholic, church, in, the, west, where, the, english, language, itself, developed, the, words, catholic, and, catholicity, are, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, that, church, specifically, however, the, more, prominent, dictionary, sense, given, for, general, use, is, still, the, one, shared, by, other, languages, implying, breadth, and, universality, reflecting, comprehensive, scope, in, a, christian, context, the, christian, church, as, identified, with, the, original, church, founded, by, christ, and, his, apostles, is, said, to, be, catholic, or, universal, in, regard, to, its, union, with, christ, in, faith, just, as, christ, is, indivisible, so, are, union, with, him, and, faith, in, him, whereby, the, christian, church, is, universal, unseparated, and, comprehensive, including, all, who, share, that, faith, orthodox, bishop, kallistos, ware, has, called, that, simple, christianity, that, is, the, sense, of, early, and, patristic, usage, wherein, the, church, usually, refers, to, itself, as, the, catholic, church, whose, faith, is, the, orthodox, faith, it, is, also, the, sense, within, the, phrase, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, found, in, the, nicene, creed, and, referred, to, in, orthodox, worship, e, g, in, the, litany, of, the, catechumens, in, the, divine, liturgy, with, the, mutual, excommunications, of, the, east, west, schism, in, 1054, the, churches, in, rome, and, constantinople, each, viewed, the, other, as, having, departed, from, the, true, church, leaving, a, smaller, but, still, catholic, church, in, place, each, retained, the, catholic, part, of, its, title, the, roman, catholic, church, or, catholic, church, on, the, one, hand, and, the, orthodox, catholic, church, on, the, other, each, of, which, was, defined, in, terms, of, inter, communion, with, either, rome, or, constantinople, while, the, eastern, orthodox, church, recognises, what, it, shares, in, common, with, other, churches, including, the, catholic, church, it, sees, catholicity, in, terms, of, complete, union, in, communion, and, faith, with, the, church, throughout, all, time, and, the, sharing, remains, incomplete, when, not, shared, fully, paul, and, the, apostles, travelled, extensively, throughout, the, roman, empire, including, asia, minor, establishing, churches, in, major, communities, with, the, first, churches, appearing, in, jerusalem, and, the, holy, land, then, in, antioch, ethiopia, egypt, rome, alexandria, athens, thessalonica, illyricum, and, byzantium, which, centuries, later, would, become, prominent, as, the, new, rome, christianity, encountered, considerable, resistance, in, the, roman, empire, mostly, because, its, adherents, refused, to, comply, with, the, demands, of, the, roman, state, often, even, when, their, lives, were, threatened, by, offering, sacrifices, to, the, pagan, gods, despite, persecution, skepticism, and, initial, social, stigma, the, christian, church, spread, particularly, following, the, conversion, of, emperor, constantine, i, in, ad, 312, by, the, fourth, century, christianity, was, present, in, numerous, regions, well, beyond, the, levant, a, number, of, influential, schools, of, thought, had, arisen, particularly, the, alexandrian, and, antiochian, philosophical, approaches, other, groups, such, as, the, arians, had, also, managed, to, gain, influence, however, their, positions, caused, theological, conflicts, within, the, church, thus, prompting, the, emperor, constantine, to, call, for, a, great, ecumenical, synod, in, order, to, define, the, church, s, position, against, the, growing, often, widely, diverging, philosophical, and, theological, interpretations, of, christianity, he, made, it, possible, for, this, council, to, meet, not, only, by, providing, a, location, but, by, offering, to, pay, for, the, transportation, of, all, the, existing, bishops, of, the, church, most, modern, christian, churches, regard, this, synod, commonly, called, the, first, council, of, nicaea, or, more, generally, the, first, ecumenical, council, as, of, major, importance, several, doctrinal, disputes, from, the, fourth, century, onwards, led, to, the, calling, of, ecumenical, councils, in, the, orthodox, church, an, ecumenical, council, is, the, supreme, authority, that, can, be, invoked, to, resolve, contested, issues, of, the, faith, as, such, these, councils, have, been, held, to, resolve, the, most, important, theological, matters, that, came, to, be, disputed, within, the, christian, church, many, lesser, disagreements, were, resolved, through, local, councils, in, the, areas, where, they, arose, before, they, grew, significant, enough, to, require, an, ecumenical, council, there, are, seven, councils, authoritatively, recognised, as, ecumenical, by, the, eastern, orthodox, church, there, are, also, two, other, councils, which, are, considered, ecumenical, by, some, eastern, orthodox, in, addition, to, these, councils, there, have, been, a, number, of, other, significant, councils, meant, to, further, define, the, eastern, orthodox, position, they, are, the, synods, of, constantinople, in, 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and, 1872, the, synod, of, ia, i, in, 1642, and, the, pan, orthodox, synod, of, jerusalem, in, 1672, another, council, convened, in, june, 2016, to, discuss, many, modern, phenomena, other, christian, confessions, eastern, orthodoxy, s, relation, with, other, religions, and, fasting, disciplines, constantinople, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, centre, and, the, cradle, of, orthodox, christian, civilisation, from, the, mid, 5th, century, to, the, early, 13th, century, constantinople, was, the, largest, and, wealthiest, city, in, europe, eastern, christian, culture, reached, its, golden, age, during, the, high, point, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, continued, to, flourish, in, ukraine, and, russia, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, numerous, autocephalous, churches, were, established, in, europe, greece, georgia, ukraine, as, well, as, in, russia, and, asia, in, the, 530s, the, church, of, the, holy, wisdom, hagia, sophia, was, built, in, constantinople, under, emperor, justinian, i, beginning, with, subsequent, byzantine, architecture, hagia, sophia, became, the, paradigmatic, orthodox, church, form, and, its, architectural, style, was, emulated, by, ottoman, mosques, a, thousand, years, later, being, the, episcopal, see, of, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, constantinople, it, remained, the, world, s, largest, cathedral, for, nearly, a, thousand, years, until, seville, cathedral, was, completed, in, 1520, hagia, sophia, has, been, described, as, holding, a, unique, position, in, the, christian, world, and, architectural, and, cultural, icon, of, byzantine, and, eastern, orthodox, civilisation, and, it, is, considered, the, epitome, of, byzantine, architecture, and, is, said, to, have, changed, the, history, of, architecture, there, are, the, nestorian, churches, resulted, from, the, reaction, of, the, council, of, ephesus, 431, which, are, the, earliest, surviving, eastern, christian, churches, that, keep, the, faith, of, only, the, first, two, ecumenical, councils, i, e, the, first, council, of, nicaea, 325, and, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, as, legitimate, nestorian, is, an, outsider,

theodore, of, mopsuestia, or, diodore, of, tarsus, the, modern, incarnation, of, the, nestorian, church, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, assyrian, church, or, fully, as, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, church, in, egypt, patriarchate, of, alexandria, split, into, two, groups, following, the, council, of, chalcedon, 451, over, a, dispute, about, the, relation, between, the, divine, and, human, natures, of, jesus, eventually, this, led, to, each, group, anathematising, the, other, those, that, remained, in, communion, with, the, other, patriarchs, by, accepting, the, council, of, chalcedon, are, known, today, as, the, greek, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, where, the, adjective, greek, refers, to, their, ties, to, the, greek, speaking, culture, of, the, byzantine, empire, those, who, disagreed, with, the, findings, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, were, the, majority, in, egypt, today, they, are, known, as, the, coptic, orthodox, church, having, maintained, a, separate, patriarchate, the, coptic, orthodox, church, is, currently, the, largest, christian, church, in, egypt, and, in, the, whole, middle, east, there, was, also, a, similar, albeit, smaller, scale, split, in, syria, patriarchate, of, antioch, which, resulted, in, the, separation, of, the, syriac, orthodox, church, from, the, byzantine, patriarchate, of, antioch, those, who, disagreed, with, the, council, of, chalcedon, are, sometimes, called, oriental, orthodox, to, distinguish, them, from, the, eastern, orthodox, who, accepted, the, council, of, chalcedon, oriental, orthodox, are, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, non, chalcedonians, or, anti, chalcedonians, the, oriental, orthodox, church, denies, that, it, is, monophysite, and, prefers, the, term, miaphysite, to, denote, the, united, nature, of, jesus, two, natures, united, into, one, consistent, with, cyril, s, theology, the, term, union, signifies, the, concurrence, in, one, reality, of, those, things, which, are, understood, to, be, united, and, the, word, who, is, ineffably, united, with, it, in, a, manner, beyond, all, description, cyril, of, alexandria, on, the, unity, of, christ, this, is, also, defined, in, the, coptic, liturgy, where, it, is, mentioned, he, made, it, one, with, his, divinity, without, mingling, without, confusion, and, without, alteration, and, his, divinity, parted, not, from, his, humanity, for, a, single, moment, nor, a, twinkling, of, an, eye, they, do, not, accept, the, teachings, of, eutyches, or, eutychianism, both, the, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, formally, believe, themselves, to, be, the, continuation, of, the, true, church, in, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, christianity, made, great, inroads, into, pagan, europe, including, bulgaria, 864, and, later, kievan, rus, 988, this, work, was, made, possible, by, cyril, and, methodius, of, thessaloniki, two, brothers, chosen, by, byzantine, emperor, michael, iii, to, fulfil, the, request, of, rastislav, of, moravia, for, teachers, who, could, minister, to, the, moravians, in, their, own, language, cyril, and, methodius, began, translating, the, divine, liturgy, other, liturgical, texts, and, the, gospels, along, with, some, other, scriptural, texts, into, local, languages, with, time, as, these, translations, were, copied, by, speakers, of, other, dialects, the, hybrid, literary, language, church, slavonic, was, created, originally, sent, to, convert, the, slavs, of, great, moravia, cyril, and, methodius, were, forced, to, compete, with, frankish, missionaries, from, the, roman, diocese, their, disciples, were, driven, out, of, great, moravia, in, ad, 886, and, emigrated, to, bulgaria, after, the, christianisation, of, bulgaria, in, 864, the, disciples, of, cyril, and, methodius, in, bulgaria, the, most, important, being, clement, of, ohrid, and, naum, of, preslav, were, of, great, importance, to, the, orthodox, faith, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, in, a, short, time, they, managed, to, prepare, and, instruct, the, future, bulgarian, clergy, into, the, biblical, texts, and, in, ad, 870, the, fourth, council, of, constantinople, granted, the, bulgarians, the, oldest, organised, autocephalous, slavic, orthodox, church, which, shortly, thereafter, became, patriarchate, the, success, of, the, conversion, of, the, bulgarians, facilitated, the, conversion, of, the, east, slavs, a, major, event, in, this, effort, was, the, development, of, the, cyrillic, script, in, bulgaria, at, the, preslav, literary, school, in, the, ninth, century, this, script, along, with, the, liturgical, old, church, slavonic, also, called, old, bulgarian, was, declared, official, in, bulgaria, in, 893, the, work, of, cyril, and, methodius, and, their, disciples, had, a, major, impact, on, the, serbs, as, well, they, accepted, christianity, collectively, along, familial, and, tribal, lines, a, gradual, process, that, occurred, between, the, seventh, and, ninth, centuries, in, commemoration, of, their, baptisms, each, serbian, family, or, tribe, began, to, celebrate, an, exclusively, serbian, custom, called, slava, patron, saint, in, a, special, way, to, honour, the, saint, on, whose, day, they, received, the, sacrament, of, baptism, it, is, the, most, solemn, day, of, the, year, for, all, serbs, of, the, orthodox, faith, and, has, played, a, role, of, vital, importance, in, the, history, of, the, serbian, people, slava, remains, a, celebration, of, the, conversion, of, the, serbian, people, which, the, church, blessed, and, proclaimed, a, church, institution, the, missionaries, to, the, east, and, south, slavs, had, great, success, in, part, because, they, used, the, people, s, native, language, rather, than, greek, the, predominant, language, of, the, byzantine, empire, or, latin, as, the, roman, priests, did, perhaps, the, greatest, legacy, of, their, efforts, is, the, russian, orthodox, church, which, is, the, largest, of, the, orthodox, churches, in, the, 11th, century, what, was, recognised, as, the, great, schism, took, place, between, rome, and, constantinople, which, led, to, separation, between, the, church, of, the, west, the, catholic, church, and, the, eastern, byzantine, churches, now, the, orthodox, there, were, doctrinal, issues, like, the, filioque, clause, and, the, authority, of, the, roman, pope, involved, in, the, split, but, these, were, greatly, exacerbated, by, political, factors, of, both, church, and, state, and, by, cultural, and, linguistic, differences, between, latins, and, greeks, regarding, papal, supremacy, the, eastern, half, grew, disillusioned, with, the, pope, s, centralisation, of, power, as, well, as, his, blatant, attempts, of, excluding, the, eastern, half, in, regard, to, papal, approvals, it, had, previously, been, the, case, that, the, emperor, would, have, a, say, when, a, new, pope, was, elected, but, towards, the, high, middle, ages, the, christians, in, rome, were, slowly, consolidating, power, and, removing, byzantine, influence, however, even, before, this, exclusionary, tendency, from, the, west, well, before, 1054, the, eastern, and, western, halves, of, the, church, were, in, perpetual, conflict, particularly, during, the, periods, of, eastern, iconoclasm, and, the, photian, schism, the, final, breach, is, often, considered, to, have, arisen, after, the, capture, and, sacking, of, constantinople, by, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, the, final, break, with, rome, occurred, circa, 1450, the, sacking, of, church, of, holy, wisdom, and, establishment, of, the, latin, empire, as, a, seeming, attempt, to, supplant, the, orthodox, byzantine, empire, in, 1204, is, viewed, with, some, rancour, to, the, present, day, in, 2004, pope, john, paul, ii, extended, a, formal, apology, for, the, sacking, of, constantinople, in, 1204, which, had, also, been, strongly, condemned, by, the, pope, at, the, time, innocent, iii, the, apology, was, formally, accepted, by, patriarch, bartholomew, of, constantinople, however, many, items, stolen, during, this, time, such, as, holy, relics, and, riches, are, still, held, in, various, european, cities, particularly, venice, reunion, was, attempted, twice, at, the, 1274, second, council, of, lyon, and, the, 1439, council, of, florence, the, council, of, florence, briefly, reestablished, communion, between, east, and, west, which, lasted, until, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, in, each, case, however, the, councils, were, rejected, by, the, orthodox, people, as, a, whole, and, the, union, of, florence, also, became, very, politically, difficult, after, constantinople, came, under, ottoman, rule, however, in, the, time, since, several, local, orthodox, christian, churches, have, renewed, union, with, rome, known, as, the, eastern, catholic, churches, recent, decades, have, seen, a, renewal, of, ecumenical, spirit, and, dialogue, between, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, the, byzantine, empire, never, fully, recovered, from, the, sack, of, constantinople, in, 1204, over, the, next, two, centuries, it, entered, a, precipitous, decline, in, both, territory, and, influence, in, 1453, a, much, diminished, byzantine, empire, fell, to, the, ottoman, empire, ending, what, was, once, the, most, powerful, state, in, the, orthodox, christian, world, if, not, in, all, christendom, by, this, time, egypt, another, major, centre, of, eastern, christianity, had, been, under, muslim, control, for, some, seven, centuries, most, eastern, orthodox, communities, across, southeastern, europe, gradually, came, under, ottoman, rule, by, the, 16th, century, under, the, ottomans, the, greek, orthodox, church, acquired, substantial, power, as, an, autonomous, millet, the, ecumenical, patriarch, was, the, religious, and, administrative, ruler, of, the, r, m, an, ottoman, administrative, unit, meaning, roman, which, encompassed, all, orthodox, subjects, of, the, empire, regardless, of, ethnicity, while, legally, subordinate, to, muslims, and, subject, to, various, restrictions, the, orthodox, community, was, generally, tolerated, until, the, rise, of, nationalist, movements, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, left, to, govern, its, own, internal, affairs, both, religiously, and, legally, until, the, empire, s, dissolution, in, the, early, 20th, century, orthodox, christians, would, remain, the, largest, non, muslim, minority, and, at, times, among, the, wealthiest, and, most, politically, influential, during, the, period, 1914, 1923, in, asia, minor, anatolia, the, greek, genocide, took, place, by, the, ottomans, as, a, result, of, the, greeks, invading, turkey, and, the, ensuing, greco, turkish, war, 1919, 1922, during, the, greek, genocide, many, orthodox, christians, were, persecuted, and, killed, the, culmination, of, the, martyrdom, was, the, asia, minor, catastrophe, with, the, killing, of, a, large, number, of, orthodox, among, them, 347, clergymen, of, the, smyrna, region, and, metropolitan, of, smyrna, chrysostomos, were, tortured, and, killed, the, period, 1923, 1924, was, followed, by, the, obligatory, population, exchange, between, greece, and, turkey, by, the, time, most, orthodox, communities, came, under, muslim, rule, in, the, mid, 15th, century, orthodoxy, was, very, strong, in, russia, which, had, maintained, close, cultural, and, political, ties, with, the, byzantine, empire, roughly, two, decades, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, ivan, iii, of, russia, married, sophia, palaiologina, a, niece, of, the, last, byzantine, emperor, constantine, xi, and, styled, himself, tsar, caesar, or, imperator, in, 1547, his,

as, the, third, rome, the, cultural, and, religious, heir, of, constantinople, until, 1666, when, patriarch, nikon, was, deposed, by, the, tsar, the, russian, orthodox, church, had, been, independent, of, the, state, in, 1721, the, first, russian, emperor, peter, i, abolished, completely, the, patriarchate, and, effectively, made, the, church, a, department, of, the, government, ruled, by, a, most, holy, synod, composed, of, senior, bishops, and, lay, bureaucrats, appointed, by, the, emperor, himself, over, time, imperial, russia, would, style, itself, a, protector, and, patron, of, all, orthodox, christians, especially, those, within, the, ottoman, empire, for, nearly, 200, years, until, the, bolsheviks, october, revolution, of, 1917, the, russian, orthodox, church, remained, in, effect, a, governmental, agency, and, an, instrument, of, tsarist, rule, it, was, used, to, varying, degrees, in, imperial, campaigns, of, russification, and, was, even, allowed, to, levy, taxes, on, peasants, the, church, s, close, ties, with, the, state, came, to, a, head, under, nicholas, i, 1825, 1855, who, explicitly, made, orthodoxy, a, core, doctrine, of, imperial, unity, and, legitimacy, the, orthodox, faith, became, further, tied, to, russian, identity, and, nationalism, while, the, church, was, further, subordinated, to, the, interests, of, the, state, consequently, russian, orthodox, church, along, with, the, imperial, regime, to, which, it, belonged, came, to, be, presented, as, an, enemy, of, the, people, by, the, bolsheviks, and, other, russian, revolutionaries, after, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, part, of, the, clergy, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, fled, abroad, to, escape, bolshevik, persecutions, founding, an, independent, church, in, exile,

church, considers, jesus, christ, to, be, the, head, of, the, church, and, the, church, to, be, his, body, it, is, believed, that, church, authority, and, the, grace, of, god, is, directly, passed, down, to, orthodox, bishops, and, other, clergy, through, the, laying, on, of, hands, a, practice, started, by, the, new, testament, apostles, and, that, this, unbroken, historical, link, is, an, essential, element, of, the, true, church, acts, 8, 17, 1, timothy, 4, 14, hebrews, 6, 2, the, eastern, orthodox, church, asserts, that, apostolic, succession, requires, apostolic, faith, and,

practising, ritual, and, liturgy, rich, in, mystery, and, symbolism, similar, to, their, views, on, the, sacraments, the, eastern, orthodox, communion, is, organised, into, several, regional, churches, which, are, either, autocephalous, or, lower, ranking, autonomous, self, governing, church, bodies, unified, in, theology, and, worship, these, include, the, fourteen, autocephalous, churches, of, the, constantinople, alexandria, antioch, jerusalem, georgia, cyprus, bulgaria, serbia, russia, greece, poland, romania, albania, and, the, czech, republic, and, slovakia, which, were,

macedonian, orthodox, church, ohrid, archbishopric, granted, autocephaly, by, the, serbian, orthodox, church, in, 2022, and, a, number, of, autonomous, churches, each, church, has, a, ruling, bishop, and, a, holy, synod, to, administer, its, jurisdiction, and, lead, the, eastern, orthodox, church, in, the, preservation, and, teaching, of, the, apostolic, and, patristic, traditions, and, church, practices, each, bishop, has, a, territory, see, over, which, he, governs, his, main, duty, is, to, make, sure, the, traditions, and, practices, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, are, preserved, bishops, are, equal, in, authority, and, cannot, interfere, in, the, jurisdiction, of, another, bishop, administratively, these, bishops, and, their, territories, are, organised, into, various, autocephalous, groups, or, synods, of, bishops, who, gather, together, at, least, twice, each, year, to, discuss, the, state, of, affairs, within, their, respective, sees, while, bishops, and, their, autocephalous, synods, have, the, ability, to, administer, guidance, in, individual, cases, their, actions, do, not, usually, set, precedents, that, affect, the, entire, eastern, orthodox, church, bishops, are, almost, always, chosen, from, the, monastic, ranks, and, must, remain, unmarried, the, ecumenical, councils, followed, a, democratic, form, with, each, bishop, having, one, vote, though, present, and, allowed, to, speak, before, the, council, members, of, the, imperial, roman, byzantine, court, abbots, priests, deacons, monks, and, laymen, were, not, allowed, to, vote, the, primary, goal, of, these, great, synods, was, to, verify, and, confirm, the, fundamental, beliefs, of, the, great, christian, church, as, truth, and, to, remove, as, heresy, any, false, teachings, that, would, threaten, the, christian, church, the, pope, of, rome, at, that, time, held, the, position, of, primus, inter, pares, first, among, equals, and, while, he, was, not, present, at, any, of, the, councils, he, continued, to, hold, this, title, until, the, east, west, schism, of, 1054, other, councils, have, helped, to, define, the, eastern, orthodox, position, specifically, the, quinisext, council, the, synods, of, constantinople, 879, 880, 1341, 1347, 1351, 1583, 1819, and, 1872, the, synod, of, ia, i, 1642, and, the, pan, orthodox, synod, of, jerusalem, 1672, the, pan, orthodox, council, held, in, greece, in, 2016, was, the, only, such, eastern, orthodox, council, in, modern, times, according, to, eastern, orthodox, teaching, the, position, of, first, among, equals, gives, no, additional, power, or, authority, to, the, bishop, that, holds, it, but, rather, that, this, person, sits, as, organisational, head, of, a, council, of, equals, like, a, president, one, of, the, decisions, made, by, the, first, council, of, constantinople, the, second, ecumenical, council, meeting, in, 381, and, supported, by, later, such, councils, was, that, the, patriarch, of,

ecumenical, council, because, is, new, rome, the, bishop, of, constantinople, is, to, enjoy, the, privileges, of, honor, after, the, bishop, of, rome, the, 28th, canon, of, the, fourth, ecumenical, council, clarified, this, point, by, stating, for, the, fathers, rightly, granted, privileges, to, the, throne, of, old, rome, because, it, was, the, royal, city, and, the, one, hundred, and, fifty, most, religious, bishops, i, e, the, second, ecumenical, council, in, 381, actuated, by, the, same, consideration, gave, equal, privileges, to, the, most, holy, throne, of, new, rome, justly, judging, that, the, city, which, is, honoured, with, the, sovereignty, and, the, senate, and, enjoys, equal, privileges, with, the, old, imperial, rome, should, in, ecclesiastical, matters, also, be, magnified, as, she, is, because, of, the, schism, the, eastern, orthodox, no, longer, recognise, the, primacy, of, the, pope, of, rome, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, therefore, like, the, pope, before, him, now, enjoys, the, title, of, first, among, equals, the, most, reliable, estimates, currently, available, number, eastern, orthodox, adherents, at, around, 220, million, worldwide, making, eastern, orthodoxy, the, second, largest, christian, communion, in, the, world, after, the, catholic, church, according, to, the, 2015, yearbook, of, international, religious, demography, as, of,

activity, across, the, world, over, two, thirds, of, all, eastern, orthodox, members, are, concentrated, in, southeast, europe, eastern, europe, and, russia, with, significant, minorities, in,

parishes, has, been, growing, with, a, 16, increase, between, 2000, and, 2010, turkey, which, for, centuries, once, had, one, of, the, largest, eastern, orthodox, communities, saw, its, overall, christian, population, fall, from, roughly, one, fifth, in, 1914, to, 2, 5, in, 1927, this, was, predominantly, due, to, the, dissolution, of, the, ottoman, empire, which, saw, most, christian,

persons, hypostases, without, overlap, or, modality, among, them, who, each, have, one, divine, essence, ousia, greek, uncreated, immaterial, and, eternal, these, three, persons, are, typically, distinguished, by, their, relation, to, each, other, the, father, is, eternal, and, not, begotten, and, does, not, proceed, from, any, the, son, is, eternal, and, begotten, of, the, father, and, the, holy, spirit, is, eternal, and, proceeds, from, the, father, orthodox, doctrine, regarding, the, trinity, is, summarised, in, the, nicene, creed, eastern, orthodox, christians, believe, in, a, monotheistic, conception, of, god, god, is, only, one, which, is, both, transcendent, wholly, independent, of, and, removed, from, the, material, universe, and, immanent, involved, in, the, material, universe, in, discussing, god, s, relationship, to, his, creation, eastern, orthodox, theology, distinguishes, between, god, s, eternal, essence, which, is, totally, transcendent, and, his, uncreated, energies, which, is, how, he, reaches, humanity, the, god, who, is, transcendent, and, the, god, who, touches, mankind, are, one, and, the, same, that, is, these, energies, are, not, something, that, proceed, from, god, or, that, god, produces, but, rather, they, are, god, himself, distinct, yet, inseparable, from, god, s, inner, being, this, view, is, often, called, palamism, in, understanding, the, trinity, as, one, god, in, three, persons, three, persons, is, not, to, be, emphasised, more, than, one, god, and, vice, versa, while, the, three, persons, are, distinct, they, are, united, in, one, divine, essence, and, their, oneness, is, expressed, in, community, and, action, so, completely, that, they, cannot, be, considered, separately, for, example, their, salvation, of, mankind, is, an, activity, engaged, in, common, christ, became, man, by, the, good, will, of, the, father, and, by, the, cooperation, of, the, holy, spirit, christ, sends, the, holy, spirit, who, proceeds, from, the, father, and, the, holy, spirit, forms, christ, in, our, hearts, and, thus, god, the, father, is, glorified, their, communion, of, essence, is, indivisible, trinitarian, terminology, essence, hypostasis, etc, are, used, philosophically, to, answer, the, ideas, of, the, heretics, and, to, place, the, terms, where, they, separate, error, and, truth, the, words, do, what, they, can, do, but, the, nature, of, the, trinity, in, its, fullness, is, believed, to, remain, beyond, man, s, comprehension, and, expression, a, holy, mystery, that, can, only, be, experienced, when, eastern, orthodox, christians, refer, to, fallen, nature, they, are, not, saying, that, human, nature, has, become, evil, in, itself, human, nature, is, still, formed, in, the, image, of, god, humans, are, still, god, s, creation, and, god, has, never, created, anything, evil, but, fallen, nature, remains, open, to, evil, intents, and, actions, it, is, sometimes, said, among, eastern, orthodox, that, humans, are, inclined, to, sin, that, is, people, find, some, sinful, things, attractive, it, is, the, nature, of, temptation, to, make, sinful, things, seem, the, more, attractive, and, it, is, the, fallen, nature, of, humans, that, seeks, or, succumbs, to, the, attraction, orthodox, christians, reject, the, augustinian, position, that, the, descendants, of, adam, and, eve, are, actually, guilty, of, the, original, sin, of, their, ancestors, since, the, fall, of, man, then, it, has, been, mankind, s, dilemma, that, no, human, can, restore, his, nature, to, union, with, god, s, grace, it, was, necessary, for, god, to, effect, another, change, in, human, nature, eastern, orthodox, christians, believe, that, christ, jesus, was, both, god, and, man, absolutely, and, completely, having, two, natures, indivisibly, eternally, begotten, of, the, father, in, his, divinity, he, was, born, in, his, humanity, of, a, woman, mary, by, her, consent, through, descent, of, the, holy, spirit, he, lived, on, earth, in, time, and, history, as, a, man, as, a, man, he, also, died, and, went, to, the, place, of, the, dead, which, is, hades, but, being, god, neither, death, nor, hades, could, contain, him, and, he, rose, to, life, again, in, his, humanity, by, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, thus, destroying, the, power, of, hades, and, of, death, itself, through, christ, s, destruction, of, hades, power, to, hold, humanity, hostage, he, made, the, path, to, salvation, effective, for, all, the, righteous, who, had, died, from, the, beginning, of, time, saving, many, including, adam, and, eve, who, are, remembered, in, the, church, as, saints, the, eastern, orthodox, church, understands, the, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, to, be, real, historical, events, as, described, in, the, gospels, of, the, new, testament, church, teaching, is, that, eastern, orthodox, christians, through, baptism, enter, a, new, life, of, salvation, through, repentance, whose, purpose, is, to, share, in, the, life, of, god, through, the, work, of, the, holy, spirit, the, eastern, orthodox, christian, life, is, a, spiritual, pilgrimage, in, which, each, person, through, the, imitation, of, christ, and, hesychasm, cultivates, the, practice, of, unceasing, prayer, each, life, occurs, within, the, life, of, the, church, as, a, member, of, the, body, of, christ, it, is, then, through, the, fire, of, god, s, love, in, the, action, of, the, holy, spirit, that, each, member, becomes, more, holy, more, wholly, unified, with, christ, starting, in, this, life, and, continuing, in, the, next, the, church, teaches, that, everyone, being, born, in, god, s, image, is, called, to, theosis, fulfilment, of, the, image, in, likeness, to, god, god, the, creator, having, divinity, by, nature, offers, each, person, participation, in, divinity, by, cooperatively, accepting, his, gift, of, grace, the, eastern, orthodox, church, in, understanding, itself, to, be, the, body, of, christ, and, similarly, in, understanding, the, christian, life, to, lead, to, the, unification, in, christ, of, all, members, of, his, body, views, the, church, as, embracing, all, christ, s, members, those, now, living, on, earth, and, also, all, those, through, the, ages, who, have, passed, on, to, the, heavenly, life, in, general, eastern, orthodox, christianity, sees, the, church, as, a, purely, mystical, body, the, understanding, of, which, cannot, be, attained, through, the, development, of, a, rational, or, natural, theology, the, church, includes, the, christian, saints, from, all, times, and, also, judges, prophets, and, righteous, jews, of, the, first, covenant, adam, and, eve, even, the, angels, and, heavenly, hosts, in, eastern, orthodox, services, the, earthly, members, together, with, the, heavenly, members, worship, god, as, one, community, in, christ, in, a, union, that, transcends, time, and, space, and, joins, heaven, to, earth, this, unity, of, the, church, is, sometimes, called, the, communion, of, the, saints, the, order, of, saint, benedict, is, an, affiliation, of, monastics, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, who, strive, to, live,

also, hold, that, the, congregation, of, the, church, comprises, both, the, living, and, the, dead, all, persons, currently, in, heaven, are, considered, to, be, saints, whether, their, names, are, known, or, not, there, are, however, those, saints, of, distinction, whom, god, has, revealed, as, particularly, good, examples, when, a, saint, is, revealed, and, ultimately, recognised, by, a, large, portion, of, the, church, a, service, of, official, recognition, glorification, is, celebrated, this, does, not, make, the, person, a, saint, it, merely, recognises, the, fact, and, announces, it, to, the, rest, of, the, church, a, day, is, prescribed, for, the, saint, s, celebration, hymns, composed, and, icons, created, numerous, saints, are, celebrated, on, each, day, of, the, year, they, are, venerated, shown, great, respect, and, love, but, not, worshipped, for, worship, is, due, god, alone, this, view, is, also, held, by, the, oriental, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, in, showing, the, saints, this, love, and, requesting, their, prayers, the, eastern, orthodox, manifest, their, belief, that, the, saints, thus, assist, in, the, process, of, salvation, for, others, pre, eminent, among, the, saints, is, the, virgin, mary, commonly, referred, to, as, theotokos, or, bogoroditsa, mother, of, god, in, eastern, orthodox, theology, the, mother, of, god, is, the, fulfilment, of, the, old, testament, archetypes, revealed, in, the, ark, of, the, covenant, because, she, carried, the, new, covenant, in, the, person, of, christ, and, the, burning, bush, that, appeared, before, moses, symbolising, the, mother, of, god, s, carrying, of, god, without, being, consumed, the, eastern, orthodox, believe, that, christ, from, the, moment, of, his, conception, was, both, fully, god, and, fully, human, mary, is, thus, called, the, theotokos, or, bogoroditsa, as, an, affirmation, of, the, divinity, of, the, one, to, whom, she, gave, birth, it, is, also, believed, that, her, virginity, was, not, compromised, in, conceiving, god, incarnate, that, she, was, not, harmed, and, that, she, remained, forever, a, virgin, scriptural, references, to, brothers, of, christ, are, interpreted, as, kin, given, that, the, word, brother, was, used, in, multiple, ways, as, was, the, term, father, due, to, her, unique, place, in, salvation, history, mary, is, honoured, above, all, other, saints, and, especially, venerated, for, the, great, work, that, god, accomplished, through, her, the, eastern, orthodox, church, regards, the, bodies, of, all, saints, as, holy, made, such, by, participation, in, the, holy, mysteries, especially, the, communion, of, christ, s, holy, body, and, blood, and, by, the, indwelling, of, the, holy, spirit, within, the, church, indeed, that, persons, and, physical, things, can, be, made, holy, is, a, cornerstone, of, the, doctrine, of, the, incarnation, made, manifest, also, directly, by, god, in, old, testament, times, through, his, dwelling, in, the, ark, of, the, covenant, thus, physical, items, connected, with, saints, are, also, regarded, as, holy, through, their, participation, in, the, earthly, works, of, those, saints, according, to, church, teaching, and, tradition, god, himself, bears, witness, to, this, holiness, of, saints, relics, through, the, many, miracles, connected, with, them, that, have, been, reported, throughout, history, since, biblical, times, often, including, healing, from, disease, and, injury, orthodox, christians, believe, that, when, a, person, dies, the, soul, is, temporarily, separated, from, the, body, though, it, may, linger, for, a, short, period, on, earth, it, is, ultimately, escorted, either, to, paradise, abraham, s, bosom, or, the, darkness, of, hades, following, the, temporary, judgment, orthodox, do, not, accept, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, which, is, held, by, catholicism, the, soul, s, experience, of, either, of, these, states, is, only, a, foretaste, being, experienced, only, by, the, soul, until, the, final, judgment, when, the, soul, and, body, will, be, reunited, the, eastern, orthodox, believe, that, the, state, of, the, soul, in, hades, can, be, affected, by, the, love, and, prayers, of, the, righteous, up, until, the, last, judgment, for, this, reason, the, church, offers, a, special, prayer, for, the, dead, on, the, third, day, ninth, day, fortieth, day, and, the, one, year, anniversary, after, the, death, of, an, orthodox, christian, there, are, also, several, days, throughout, the, year, that, are, set, aside, for, general,

given, in, the, translation, by, theodotion, the, patriarchal, text, is, used, for, the, new, testament, orthodox, christians, hold, that, the, bible, is, a, verbal, icon, of, christ, as, proclaimed, by, the, 7th, ecumenical, council, they, refer, to, the, bible, as, holy, scripture, meaning, writings, containing, the, foundational, truths, of, the, christian, faith, as, revealed, by, christ, and, the, holy, spirit, to, its, divinely, inspired, human, authors, holy, scripture, forms, the, primary, and, authoritative, written, witness, of, holy, tradition, and, is, essential, as, the, basis, for, all, orthodox, teaching, and, belief, once, established, as, holy, scripture, there, has, never, been, any, question, that, the, eastern, orthodox, church, holds, the, full, list, of, books, to,

the, holy, mysteries, or, sacraments, as, well, as, in, many, other, christian, traditions, for, example, in, catholicism, it, serves, to, unite, a, woman, and, a, man, in, eternal, union, and, love, before, god, with, the, purpose, of, following, christ, and, his, gospel, and, raising, up, a, faithful, holy, family, through, their, holy, union, the, church, understands, marriage, to, be, the, union, of, one, man, and, one, woman, and, certain, orthodox, leaders, have, spoken, out, strongly, in, opposition, to, the, civil, institution, of, same, sex, marriage, jesus, said, that, when, they, rise, from, the, dead, they, neither, marry, nor, are, given, in, marriage, but, are, like, angels, in, heaven, mk, 12, 25, for, the, orthodox, christian, this, passage, should, not, be, understood, to, imply, that, christian, marriage, will, not, remain, a, reality, in, the, kingdom, but, points, to, the, fact, that, relations, will, not, be, fleshy, but, spiritual, love, between, wife, and, husband, as, an, icon, of, relationship, between, christ, and, church, is, eternal, the, church, does, recognise, that, there, are, rare, occasions, when, it, is, better, that, couples, do, separate, but, there, is, no, official, recognition, of, civil, divorces, for, the, eastern, orthodox, to, say, that, marriage, is, indissoluble, means, that, it, should, not, be, broken, the, violation, of, such, a, union, perceived, as, holy, being, an, offence, resulting, from, either, adultery, or, the, prolonged, absence, of, one, of, the, partners, thus, permitting, remarriage, is, an, act, of, compassion, of, the, church, towards, sinful, man, widowed, priests, and, deacons, may, not, remarry, and, it, is, common, for, such, members, of, the, clergy, to, retire, to, a, monastery, see, clerical, celibacy, this, is, also, true, of, widowed, wives, of, clergy, who, do, not, remarry, and, become, nuns, when, their, children, are, grown, only, men, are, allowed, to, receive, holy,

deacon, angelic, molen, in, zimbabwe, making, her, the, first, female, deacon, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, this, move, was, met, with, criticism, from, other, autocephalous, orthodox, church, leaders, such, as, the, antiochian, orthodox, christian, archdiocese, of, north, america, s, metropolitan, saba, esber, and, archpriest, john, whiteford, of, the, rocor, who, criticized, the, move,

communions, have, not, been, improved, in, any, relevant, way, dogmatic, and, liturgical, polarities, have, been, significant, even, and, especially, in, recent, times, a, pertinent, point, of, contention, between, the, monarchically, papal, administratively, centralised, catholic, church, and, the, decentralised, confederation, of, orthodox, churches, is, the, theological, significance, of,
