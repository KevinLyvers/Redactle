in, buddhism, the, four, noble, truths, sanskrit, romanized, catvary, ryasaty, ni, pali, catt, ri, ariyasacc, ni, the, four, arya, satya, are, the, truths, of, the, noble, ones, the, truths, or, realities, for, the, spiritually, worthy, ones, the, truths, are, the, four, truths, appear, in, many, grammatical, forms, in, the, ancient, buddhist, texts, and, are, traditionally, identified, as, the, first, teaching, given, by, the, buddha, while, often, called, one, of, the, most, important, teachings, in, buddhism, they, have, both, a, symbolic, and, a, propositional, function, symbolically, they, represent, the, awakening, and, liberation, of, the, buddha, and, of, the, potential, for, his, followers, to, reach, the, same, liberation, and, freedom, as, him, as, propositions, the, four, truths, are, a, conceptual, framework, that, appear, in, the, pali, canon, and, early, hybrid, sanskrit, buddhist, scriptures, as, a, part, of, the, broader, network, of, teachings, the, dhamma, matrix, which, have, to, be, taken, together, they, provide, a, conceptual, framework, for, introducing, and, explaining, buddhist, thought, which, has, to, be, personally, understood, or, experienced, as, a, proposition, the, four, truths, defy, an, exact, definition, but, refer, to, and, express, the, basic, orientation, of, buddhism, unguarded, sensory, contact, gives, rise, to, craving, and, clinging, to, impermanent, states, and, things, which, are, dukkha, unsatisfactory, incapable, of, satisfying, and, painful, this, craving, keeps, us, caught, in, sa, s, ra, wandering, usually, interpreted, as, the, endless, cycle, of, repeated, rebirth, and, the, continued, dukkha, that, comes, with, it, but, also, referring, to, the, endless, cycle, of, attraction, and, rejection, that, perpetuates, the, ego, mind, there, is, a, way, to, end, this, cycle, namely, by, attaining, nirvana, cessation, of, craving, whereafter, rebirth, and, the, accompanying, dukkha, will, no, longer, arise, again, this, can, be, accomplished, by, following, the, eightfold, path, confining, our, automatic, responses, to, sensory, contact, by, restraining, oneself, cultivating, discipline, and, wholesome, states, and, practicing, mindfulness, and, dhyana, meditation, the, function, of, the, four, truths, and, their, importance, developed, over, time, and, the, buddhist, tradition, slowly, recognized, them, as, the, buddha, s, first, teaching, this, tradition, was, established, when, prajna, or, liberating, insight, came, to, be, regarded, as, liberating, in, itself, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, the, practice, of, dhyana, this, liberating, insight, gained, a, prominent, place, in, the, sutras, and, the, four, truths, came, to, represent, this, liberating, insight, as, a, part, of, the, enlightenment, story, of, the, buddha, the, four, truths, grew, to, be, of, central, importance, in, the, theravada, tradition, of, buddhism, by, about, the, 5th, century, ce, which, holds, that, the, insight, into, the, four, truths, is, liberating, in, itself, they, are, less, prominent, in, the, mahayana, tradition, which, sees, the, higher, aims, of, insight, into, sunyata, emptiness, and, following, the, bodhisattva, path, as, central, elements, in, their, teachings, and, practice, the, mahayana, tradition, reinterpreted, the, four, truths, to, explain, how, a, liberated, being, can, still, be, pervasively, operative, in, this, world, beginning, with, the, exploration, of, buddhism, by, western, colonialists, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, development, of, buddhist, modernism, they, came, to, be, often, presented, in, the, west, as, the, central, teaching, of, buddhism, sometimes, with, novel, modernistic, reinterpretations, very, different, from, the, historic, buddhist, traditions, in, asia, the, four, truths, are, best, known, from, their, presentation, in, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, text, which, contains, two, sets, of, the, four, truths, while, various, other, sets, can, be, found, in, the, p, li, canon, a, collection, of, scriptures, in, the, theravadan, buddhist, tradition, the, full, set, which, is, most, commonly, used, in, modern, expositions, contains, grammatical, errors, pointing, to, multiple, sources, for, this, set, and, translation, problems, within, the, ancient, buddhist, community, nevertheless, they, were, considered, correct, by, the, pali, tradition, which, did, not, correct, them, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, setting, the, wheel, of, dhamma, in, motion, contains, the, first, teachings, that, the, buddha, gave, after, attaining, full, awakening, and, liberation, from, rebirth, according, to, l, s, cousins, many, scholars, are, of, the, view, that, this, discourse, was, identified, as, the, first, sermon, of, the, buddha, only, at, a, later, date, and, according, to, professor, of, religion, carol, s, anderson, the, four, truths, may, originally, not, have, been, part, of, this, sutta, but, were, later, added, in, some, versions, within, this, discourse, the, four, noble, truths, are, given, as, follows, bhikkus, is, normally, translated, as, buddhist, monks, now, this, bhikkhus, is, the, noble, truth, of, suffering, birth, is, suffering, aging, is, suffering, illness, is, suffering, death, is, suffering, union, with, what, is, displeasing, is, suffering, separation, from, what, is, pleasing, is, suffering, not, to, get, what, one, wants, is, suffering, in, brief, the, five, aggregates, subject, to, clinging, are, suffering, now, this, bhikkhus, is, the, noble, truth, of, the, origin, of, suffering, it, is, this, craving, which, leads, to, re, becoming, accompanied, by, delight, and, lust, seeking, delight, here, and, there, that, is, craving, for, sensual, pleasures, craving, for, becoming, craving, for, disbecoming, now, this, bhikkhus, is, the, noble, truth, of, the, cessation, of, suffering, it, is, the, remainderless, fading, away, and, cessation, of, that, same, craving, the, giving, up, and, relinquishing, of, it, freedom, from, it, non, reliance, on, it, now, this, bhikkhus, is, the, noble, truth, of, the, way, leading, to, the, cessation, of, suffering, it, is, this, noble, eightfold, path, that, is, right, view, right, intention, right, speech, right, action, right, livelihood, right, effort, right, mindfulness, right, concentration, according, to, this, sutra, with, the, complete, comprehension, of, these, four, truths, release, from, samsara, the, cycle, of, rebirth, was, attained, knowledge, vision, arose, in, me, unprovoked, is, my, release, this, is, the, last, birth, there, is, now, no, further, becoming, the, comprehension, of, these, four, truths, by, his, audience, leads, to, the, opening, of, the, dhamma, eye, that, is, the, attainment, of, right, vision, whatever, is, subject, to, origination, is, subject, to, cessation, according, to, k, r, norman, the, basic, set, is, as, follows, according, to, k, r, norman, the, pali, canon, contains, various, shortened, forms, of, the, four, truths, the, mnemonic, set, which, were, intended, to, remind, the, hearer, of, the, full, form, of, the, nts, the, earliest, form, of, the, mnemonic, set, was, dukkham, samudayo, nirodho, marga, without, the, reference, to, the, pali, terms, sacca, or, arya, which, were, later, added, to, the, formula, the, four, mnemonic, terms, can, be, translated, as, follows, according, to, l, s, cousins, the, four, truths, are, not, restricted, to, the, well, known, form, where, dukkha, is, the, subject, other, forms, take, the, world, the, arising, of, the, world, or, the, savas, the, arising, of, the, savas, as, their, subject, according, to, cousins, the, well, known, form, is, simply, shorthand, for, all, of, the, forms, the, world, refers, to, the, sa, kh, ras, that, is, all, compounded, things, or, to, the, six, sense, spheres, the, various, terms, all, point, to, the, same, basic, idea, of, buddhism, as, described, in, five, skandhas, and, twelve, nid, nas, in, the, five, skandhas, sense, contact, with, objects, leads, to, sensation, and, perception, the, sa, kh, ra, inclinations, c, q, craving, etc, determine, the, interpretation, of, and, the, response, to, these, sensations, and, perceptions, and, affect, consciousness, in, specific, ways, the, twelve, nid, nas, describe, the, further, process, craving, and, clinging, up, d, na, lead, to, bhava, becoming, and, j, ti, birth, in, the, orthodox, interpretation, bhava, is, interpreted, as, kammabhava, that, is, karma, while, j, ti, is, interpreted, as, rebirth, from, sensation, comes, craving, from, craving, comes, karma, from, karma, comes, rebirth, the, aim, of, the, buddhist, path, is, to, reverse, this, causal, chain, when, there, is, no, response, to, sensation, there, is, no, craving, no, karma, no, rebirth, in, thai, buddhism, bhava, is, interpreted, as, behavior, which, serves, craving, and, clinging, while, j, ti, is, interpreted, as, the, repeated, birth, of, the, ego, or, self, sense, which, perpetuates, the, process, of, self, serving, responses, and, actions, the, pali, terms, ariya, sacca, sanskrit, arya, satya, are, commonly, translated, as, noble, truths, this, translation, is, a, convention, started, by, the, earliest, translators, of, buddhist, texts, into, english, according, to, k, r, norman, this, is, just, one, of, several, possible, translations, according, to, paul, williams, here, is, no, particular, reason, why, the, pali, expression, ariyasaccani, should, be, translated, as, noble, truths, it, could, equally, be, translated, as, the, nobles, truths, or, the, truths, for, nobles, or, the, nobilising, truths, or, the, truths, of, possessed, by, the, noble, ones, in, fact, the, pali, expression, and, its, sanskrit, equivalent, can, mean, all, of, these, although, the, pali, commentators, place, the, noble, truths, as, the, least, important, in, their, understanding, the, term, arya, was, later, added, to, the, four, truths, the, term, ariya, sanskrit, arya, can, be, translated, as, noble, not, ordinary, valuable, precious, pure, paul, williams, the, aryas, are, the, noble, ones, the, saints, those, who, have, attained, the, fruits, of, the, path, that, middle, path, the, tathagata, has, comprehended, which, promotes, sight, and, knowledge, and, which, tends, to, peace, higher, wisdom, enlightenment, and, nibbana, the, term, sacca, sanskrit, satya, is, a, central, term, in, indian, thought, and, religion, it, is, typically, translated, as, truth, but, it, also, means, that, which, is, in, accord, with, reality, or, reality, according, to, rupert, gethin, the, four, truths, are, four, true, things, or, realities, whose, nature, we, are, told, the, buddha, finally, understood, on, the, night, of, his, awakening, they, function, as, a, convenient, conceptual, framework, for, making, sense, of, buddhist, thought, according, to, k, r, norman, probably, the, best, translation, is, the, truth, of, the, noble, one, the, buddha, it, is, a, statement, of, how, things, are, seen, by, a, buddha, how, things, really, are, when, seen, correctly, it, is, the, truthful, way, of, seeing, through, not, seeing, things, this, way, and, behaving, accordingly, we, suffer, according, to, anderson, the, four, truths, have, both, a, symbolic, and, a, propositional, function, the, four, noble, truths, are, truly, set, apart, within, the, body, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, not, because, they, are, by, definition, sacred, but, because, they, are, both, a, symbol, and, a, doctrine, and, transformative, within, the, sphere, of, right, view, as, one, doctrine, among, others, the, four, noble, truths, make, explicit, the, structure, within, which, one, should, seek, enlightenment, as, a, symbol, the, four, noble, truths, evoke, the, possibility, of, enlightenment, as, both, they, occupy, not, only, a, central, but, a, singular, position, within, the, theravada, canon, and, tradition, as, a, symbol, they, refer, to, the, possibility, of, awakening, as, represented, by, the, buddha, and, are, of, utmost, importance, hen, the, four, noble, truths, are, regarded, in, the, canon, as, the, first, teaching, of, the, buddha, they, function, as, a, view, or, doctrine, that, assumes, a, symbolic, function, where, the, four, noble, truths, appear, in, the, guise, of, a, religious, symbol, in, the, sutta, pitaka, and, the, vinaya, pitaka, of, the, pali, canon, they, represent, the, enlightenment, experience, of, the, buddha, and, the, possibility, of, enlightenment, for, all, buddhists, within, the, cosmos, as, a, proposition, they, are, part, of, the, matrix, or, network, of, teachings, in, which, they, are, not, particularly, central, but, have, an, equal, place, next, to, other, teachings, describing, how, release, from, craving, is, to, be, reached, a, long, recognized, feature, of, the, theravada, canon, is, that, it, lacks, an, overarching, and, comprehensive, structure, of, the, path, to, nibbana, the, sutras, form, a, network, or, matrix, and, the, four, truths, appear, within, this, network, of, teachings, which, have, to, be, taken, together, within, this, network, the, four, noble, truths, are, one, doctrine, among, others, and, are, not, particularly, central, but, are, a, part, of, the, entire, dhamma, matrix, the, four, noble, truths, are, set, and, learnt, in, that, network, learning, how, the, various, teachings, intersect, with, each, other, and, refer, to, the, various, buddhist, techniques, which, are, all, explicitly, and, implicitly, part, of, the, passages, which, refer, to, the, four, truths, according, to, anderson, there, is, no, single, way, of, understanding, the, teachings, one, teaching, may, be, used, to, explain, another, in, one, passage, the, relationship, may, be, reversed, or, altered, in, other, talks, as, a, proposition, the, four, truths, defy, an, exact, definition, but, refer, to, and, express, the, basic, orientation, of, buddhism, sensory, contact, gives, rise, to, clinging, and, craving, to, temporary, states, and, things, which, is, ultimately, unsatisfactory, dukkha, and, sustains, samsara, the, repeated, cycle, of, bhava, becoming, habitual, tendencies, and, j, ti, birth, interpreted, as, either, rebirth, the, coming, to, be, of, a, new, existence, or, as, the, arising, of, the, sense, of, self, as, a, mental, phenomenon, by, following, the, buddhist, path, craving, and, clinging, can, be, confined, peace, of, mind, and, real, happiness, can, be, attained, and, the, repeated, cycle, of, repeated, becoming, and, birth, will, be, stopped, the, truth, of, dukkha, incapable, of, satisfying, painful, from, dush, stha, standing, unstable, is, the, basic, insight, that, samsara, life, in, this, mundane, world, with, its, clinging, and, craving, to, impermanent, states, and, things, is, dukkha, unsatisfactory, and, painful, we, expect, happiness, from, states, and, things, which, are, impermanent, and, therefore, cannot, attain, real, happiness, the, truth, of, samudaya, arising, coming, together, or, dukkha, samudaya, the, origination, or, arising, of, dukkha, is, the, truth, that, samsara, and, its, associated, dukkha, arises, or, continues, with, ta, h, thirst, craving, for, and, clinging, to, these, impermanent, states, and, things, in, the, orthodox, view, this, clinging, and, craving, produces, karma, which, leads, to, renewed, becoming, keeping, us, trapped, in, rebirth, and, renewed, dissatisfaction, craving, includes, kama, tanha, craving, for, sense, pleasures, bhava, tanha, craving, to, continue, the, cycle, of, life, and, death, including, rebirth, and, vibhava, tanha, craving, to, not, experience, the, world, and, painful, feelings, while, dukkha, samudaya, the, term, in, the, basic, set, of, the, four, truths, is, traditionally, translated, and, explained, as, the, origin, or, cause, of, suffering, giving, a, causal, explanation, of, dukkha, brazier, and, batchelor, point, to, the, wider, connotations, of, the, term, samudaya, coming, into, existence, together, together, with, dukkha, arises, tanha, thirst, craving, does, not, cause, dukkha, but, comes, into, existence, together, with, dukkha, or, the, five, skandhas, it, is, this, craving, which, is, to, be, confined, as, kondanna, understood, at, the, end, of, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, whatever, arises, ceases, the, truth, of, nirodha, cessation, suppression, renouncing, letting, go, or, dukkha, nirodha, the, cessation, of, dukkha, is, the, truth, that, dukkha, ceases, or, can, be, confined, when, one, renounces, or, confines, craving, and, clinging, and, nirvana, is, attained, alternatively, tanha, itself, as, a, response, to, dukkha, is, to, be, confined, nirvana, refers, to, the, moment, of, attainment, itself, and, the, resulting, peace, of, mind, and, happiness, khlesa, nirvana, but, also, to, the, final, dissolution, of, the, five, skandhas, at, the, time, of, death, skandha, nirvana, or, parinirvana, in, the, theravada, tradition, it, also, refers, to, a, transcendental, reality, which, is, known, at, the, moment, of, awakening, according, to, gethin, modern, buddhist, usage, tends, to, restrict, nirv, a, to, the, awakening, experience, and, reserve, parinirv, a, for, the, death, experience, when, nirvana, is, attained, no, more, karma, is, being, produced, and, rebirth, and, dissatisfaction, will, no, longer, arise, again, cessation, is, nirvana, blowing, out, and, peace, of, mind, joseph, goldstein, explains, ajahn, buddhadasa, a, well, known, thai, master, of, the, last, century, said, that, when, village, people, in, india, were, cooking, rice, and, waiting, for, it, to, cool, they, might, remark, wait, a, little, for, the, rice, to, become, nibbana, so, here, nibbana, means, the, cool, state, of, mind, free, from, the, fires, of, the, defilements, as, ajahn, buddhadasa, remarked, the, cooler, the, mind, the, more, nibbana, in, that, moment, we, can, notice, for, ourselves, relative, states, of, coolness, in, our, own, minds, as, we, go, through, the, day, the, truth, of, magga, refers, to, the, path, to, the, cessation, of, or, liberation, from, dukkha, c, q, tanha, by, following, the, noble, eightfold, path, to, moksha, liberation, restraining, oneself, cultivating, discipline, and, practicing, mindfulness, and, meditation, one, starts, to, disengage, from, craving, and, clinging, to, impermanent, states, and, things, and, rebirth, and, dissatisfaction, will, be, ended, the, term, path, is, usually, taken, to, mean, the, noble, eightfold, path, but, other, versions, of, the, path, can, also, be, found, in, the, nikayas, the, theravada, tradition, regards, insight, into, the, four, truths, as, liberating, in, itself, the, well, known, eightfold, path, consists, of, the, understanding, that, this, world, is, fleeting, and, unsatisfying, and, how, craving, keeps, us, tied, to, this, fleeting, world, a, friendly, and, compassionate, attitude, to, others, a, correct, way, of, behaving, mind, control, which, means, not, feeding, on, negative, thoughts, and, nurturing, positive, thoughts, constant, awareness, of, the, feelings, and, responses, which, arise, and, the, practice, of, dhyana, meditation, the, tenfold, path, adds, the, right, liberating, insight, and, liberation, from, rebirth, the, four, truths, are, to, be, internalised, and, understood, or, experienced, personally, to, turn, them, into, a, lived, reality, the, four, truths, describe, dukkha, and, its, ending, as, a, means, to, reach, peace, of, mind, in, this, life, but, also, as, a, means, to, end, rebirth, according, to, geoffrey, samuel, the, four, noble, truths, describe, the, knowledge, needed, to, set, out, on, the, path, to, liberation, from, rebirth, by, understanding, the, four, truths, one, can, stop, this, clinging, and, craving, attain, a, pacified, mind, and, be, freed, from, this, cycle, of, rebirth, and, redeath, patrick, olivelle, explains, that, moksha, is, a, central, concept, in, indian, religions, and, literally, means, freedom, from, samsara, melvin, e, spiro, further, explains, that, desire, is, the, cause, of, suffering, because, desire, is, the, cause, of, rebirth, when, desire, ceases, rebirth, and, its, accompanying, suffering, ceases, peter, harvey, explains, once, birth, has, arisen, ageing, and, death, and, various, other, dukkha, states, follow, while, saying, that, birth, is, the, cause, of, death, may, sound, rather, simplistic, in, buddhism, it, is, a, very, significant, statement, for, there, is, an, alternative, to, being, born, this, is, to, attain, nirv, na, so, bringing, an, end, to, the, process, of, rebirth, and, redeath, nirv, na, is, not, subject, to, time, and, change, and, so, is, known, as, the, unborn, as, it, is, not, born, it, cannot, die, and, so, it, is, also, known, as, the, deathless, to, attain, this, state, all, phenomena, subject, to, birth, the, khandhas, and, nid, nas, must, be, transcended, by, means, of, non, attachment, the, last, sermon, the, maha, parinibbana, sutta, last, days, of, the, buddha, digha, nikaya, 16, states, it, as, follows, it, is, through, not, realizing, through, not, penetrating, the, four, noble, truths, that, this, long, course, of, birth, and, death, has, been, passed, through, and, undergone, by, me, as, well, as, by, you, but, now, bhikkhus, that, these, have, been, realized, and, penetrated, cut, off, is, the, craving, for, existence, destroyed, is, that, which, leads, to, renewed, becoming, and, there, is, no, fresh, becoming, according, to, bhikkhu, buddhadasa, birth, does, refer, not, to, physical, birth, and, death, but, to, the, birth, and, death, of, our, self, concept, the, emergence, of, the, ego, according, to, buddhadhasa, dependent, arising, is, a, phenomenon, that, lasts, an, instant, it, is, impermanent, therefore, birth, and, death, must, be, explained, as, phenomena, within, the, process, of, dependent, arising, in, everyday, life, of, ordinary, people, right, mindfulness, is, lost, during, contacts, of, the, roots, and, surroundings, thereafter, when, vexation, due, to, greed, anger, and, ignorance, is, experienced, the, ego, has, already, been, born, it, is, considered, as, one, birth, some, contemporary, teachers, tend, to, explain, the, four, truths, psychologically, by, taking, dukkha, to, mean, mental, anguish, in, addition, to, the, physical, pain, of, life, and, interpreting, the, four, truths, as, a, means, to, attain, happiness, in, this, life, in, the, contemporary, vipassana, movement, that, emerged, out, of, the, theravada, buddhism, freedom, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, have, become, the, main, goals, not, the, end, of, rebirth, which, is, hardly, mentioned, in, their, teachings, yet, though, freedom, and, happiness, is, a, part, of, the, buddhist, teachings, these, words, refer, to, something, different, in, traditional, asian, buddhism, according, to, gil, fronsdal, when, asian, teachers, do, talk, about, freedom, it, is, primarily, in, reference, to, what, one, is, free, from, that, is, from, greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong, view, self, and, most, significantly, rebirth, nibbana, is, the, final, freedom, and, it, has, no, purpose, beyond, itself, in, contrast, freedom, in, the, creative, modern, interpretation, of, four, noble, truths, and, the, eightfold, path, means, living, happily, and, wisely, without, drastic, changes, in, lifestyle, such, freedom, and, happiness, is, not, the, goal, of, four, noble, truths, and, related, doctrines, within, traditional, buddhism, but, the, vipassana, teachings, in, the, west, make, no, reference, to, traditional, theravada, doctrines, instead, they, present, only, the, pragmatic, and, experiential, goals, in, the, form, of, therapy, for, the, audience, s, current, lives, the, creative, interpretations, are, driven, in, part, because, the, foundational, premises, of, buddhism, do, not, make, sense, to, audiences, outside, of, asia, according, to, spiro, the, buddhist, message, is, not, simply, a, psychological, message, but, an, eschatological, message, according, to, anderson, the, four, truths, are, recognized, as, perhaps, the, most, important, teaching, of, the, buddha, yet, as, early, as, 1935, caroline, rhys, davids, wrote, that, for, a, teaching, so, central, to, theravada, buddhism, it, was, missing, from, critical, passages, in, the, pali, canon, according, to, gethin, the, four, truths, and, the, eightfold, path, are, only, two, lists, of, literally, hundreds, of, similar, lists, covering, the, whole, range, of, the, theory, and, practice, of, ancient, buddhism, the, position, of, the, four, truths, within, the, canon, raises, questions, and, has, been, investigated, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, according, to, academic, scholars, inconsistencies, in, the, oldest, texts, may, reveal, developments, in, the, oldest, teachings, while, the, theravada, tradition, holds, that, the, sutta, pitaka, is, the, definitive, recension, of, the, buddha, word, and, theravadins, argue, that, it, is, likely, that, the, sutras, date, back, to, the, buddha, himself, in, an, unbroken, chain, of, oral, transmission, academic, scholars, have, identified, many, such, inconsistencies, and, tried, to, explain, them, information, of, the, oldest, teachings, of, buddhism, such, as, on, the, four, noble, truths, has, been, obtained, by, analysis, of, the, oldest, texts, and, these, inconsistencies, and, are, a, matter, of, ongoing, discussion, and, research, according, to, schmithausen, three, positions, held, by, scholars, of, buddhism, can, be, distinguished, regarding, the, possibility, to, retain, knowledge, of, the, oldest, buddhism, buddhologist, eviatar, shulman, proposes, that, in, its, original, form, the, four, truths, were, rooted, in, meditative, perception, of, mental, events, building, on, his, analysis, of, the, p, li, term, ayam, which, is, equivalent, he, claims, to, an, immediate, perception, such, as, this, here, right, now, in, front, of, me, according, to, bronkhorst, the, four, truths, may, already, have, been, formulated, in, earliest, buddhism, but, did, not, have, the, central, place, they, acquired, in, later, buddhism, according, to, anderson, only, by, the, time, of, the, commentaries, in, the, fifth, century, ce, did, the, four, truths, come, to, be, identified, in, the, theravada, tradition, as, the, central, teaching, of, the, buddha, according, to, anderson, the, four, noble, truths, were, probably, not, part, of, the, earliest, strata, of, what, came, to, be, recognized, as, buddhism, but, that, they, emerged, as, a, central, teaching, in, a, slightly, later, period, that, still, preceded, the, final, redactions, of, the, various, buddhist, canons, according, to, feer, and, anderson, the, four, truths, probably, entered, the, sutta, pitaka, from, the, vinaya, the, rules, for, monastic, order, they, were, first, added, to, enlightenment, stories, which, contain, the, four, jhanas, replacing, terms, for, liberating, insight, from, there, they, were, added, to, the, biographical, stories, of, the, buddha, scholars, have, noted, inconsistencies, in, the, presentations, of, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, and, the, buddhist, path, to, liberation, in, the, oldest, sutras, they, argue, that, these, inconsistencies, show, that, the, buddhist, teachings, evolved, either, during, the, lifetime, of, the, buddha, or, thereafter, according, to, the, japanese, scholar, ui, the, four, truths, are, not, the, earliest, representation, of, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, instead, they, are, a, rather, late, theory, on, the, content, of, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, according, to, vetter, and, bronkhorst, the, earliest, buddhist, path, consisted, of, a, set, of, practices, which, culminate, in, the, practice, of, dhyana, leading, to, a, calm, of, mind, and, awareness, mindfulness, which, according, to, vetter, is, the, liberation, which, is, being, sought, later, on, liberating, insight, came, to, be, regarded, as, equally, liberating, this, liberating, insight, came, to, be, exemplified, by, prajna, or, the, insight, in, the, four, truths, but, also, by, other, elements, of, the, buddhist, teachings, according, to, vetter, and, bronkhorst, this, growing, importance, of, liberating, insight, was, a, response, to, other, religious, groups, in, india, which, held, that, a, liberating, insight, was, indispensable, for, moksha, liberation, from, rebirth, this, change, is, reflected, in, the, canon, where, according, to, bronkhorst, the, accounts, which, include, the, four, noble, truths, had, a, completely, different, conception, of, the, process, of, liberation, than, the, one, which, includes, the, four, dhyanas, and, the, destruction, of, the, intoxicants, according, to, vetter, and, bonkhorst, the, ideas, on, what, exactly, constituted, this, liberating, insight, was, not, fixed, but, developed, over, time, according, to, bronkhorst, in, earliest, buddhism, the, four, truths, did, not, serve, as, a, description, of, liberating, insight, initially, the, term, prajna, served, to, denote, this, liberating, insight, later, on, prajna, was, replaced, in, the, suttas, by, the, four, truths, this, happened, in, those, texts, where, practicing, the, four, jhanas, preceded, the, attainment, of, liberating, insight, and, where, this, practice, of, the, four, jhanas, then, culminates, in, liberating, insight, this, liberating, insight, came, to, be, defined, as, insight, into, the, four, truths, which, is, presented, as, the, liberating, insight, which, constituted, the, awakening, or, enlightenment, of, the, buddha, when, he, understood, these, truths, he, was, enlightened, and, liberated, as, reflected, in, majjhima, nikaya, 26, 42, his, taints, are, destroyed, by, his, seeing, with, wisdom, bronkhorst, points, to, an, inconsistency, noting, that, the, four, truths, refer, here, to, the, eightfold, path, as, the, means, to, gain, liberation, while, the, attainment, of, insight, into, the, four, truths, is, portrayed, as, liberating, in, itself, according, to, bronkhorst, this, is, an, inconsistency, which, reveals, a, change, which, took, place, over, time, in, the, composition, of, the, sutras, an, example, of, this, substitution, and, its, consequences, is, majjhima, nikaya, 36, 42, 43, which, gives, an, account, of, the, awakening, of, the, buddha, according, to, schmithausen, the, four, truths, were, superseded, by, pratityasamutpada, and, still, later, in, the, hinayana, schools, by, the, doctrine, of, the, non, existence, of, a, substantial, self, or, person, schmithausen, further, states, that, still, other, descriptions, of, this, liberating, insight, exist, in, the, buddhist, canon, that, the, five, skandhas, are, impermanent, disagreeable, and, neither, the, self, nor, belonging, to, oneself, the, contemplation, of, the, arising, and, disappearance, udayabbaya, of, the, five, skandhas, the, realisation, of, the, skandhas, as, empty, rittaka, vain, tucchaka, and, without, any, pith, or, substance, asaraka, in, contrast, thanissaro, bikkhu, presents, the, view, that, the, four, truths, pratityasamutpada, and, anatta, are, inextricably, intertwined, in, their, symbolic, function, the, sutras, present, the, insight, into, the, four, truths, as, the, culmination, of, the, buddha, s, path, to, awakening, in, the, vinayapitaka, and, the, sutta, pitaka, they, have, the, same, symbolic, function, in, a, reenactment, by, his, listeners, of, the, buddha, s, awakening, by, attaining, the, dhamma, eye, in, contrast, here, this, insight, serves, as, the, starting, point, to, path, entry, for, his, audience, these, sutras, present, a, repeated, sequence, of, events, yet, in, other, sutras, where, the, four, truths, have, a, propositional, function, the, comprehension, of, the, four, truths, destroys, the, corruptions, they, do, so, in, combination, with, the, practice, of, the, jhanas, and, the, attainment, of, the, divine, eye, with, which, past, lives, and, the, working, of, rebirth, are, being, seen, according, to, anderson, following, schmithausen, and, bronkhorst, these, two, presentations, give, two, different, models, of, the, path, to, liberation, reflecting, their, function, as, a, symbol, and, as, a, proposition, most, likely, the, four, truths, were, first, associated, with, the, culmination, of, the, path, in, the, destruction, of, the, sav, s, where, they, substituted, the, unspecified, liberating, insight, as, the, canon, developed, they, became, more, logically, associated, with, the, beginning, of, the, buddhist, path, according, to, anderson, there, is, a, strong, tendency, within, scholarship, to, present, the, four, truths, as, the, most, essential, teaching, of, buddhism, according, to, anderson, the, four, truths, have, been, simplified, and, popularized, in, western, writings, due, to, the, colonial, project, of, gaining, control, over, buddhism, according, to, crosby, the, buddhist, teachings, are, reduced, to, a, simple, single, rationalized, account, which, has, parallels, in, the, reinterpretation, of, the, buddha, in, western, literature, the, presentation, of, the, four, truths, as, one, of, the, most, important, teachings, of, the, buddha, has, been, to, reduce, the, four, noble, truths, to, a, teaching, that, is, accessible, pliable, and, therefore, readily, appropriated, by, non, buddhists, there, is, a, great, variety, of, teachings, in, the, buddhist, literature, which, may, be, bewildering, for, those, who, are, unaware, of, this, variety, the, four, truths, are, easily, accessible, in, this, regard, and, are, readily, by, those, outside, the, buddhist, traditions, for, example, walpola, rahula, s, what, the, buddha, taught, a, widely, used, introductory, text, for, non, buddhists, uses, the, four, truths, as, a, framework, to, present, an, overview, of, the, buddhist, teachings, according, to, harris, the, british, in, the, 19th, century, crafted, new, representations, of, buddhism, and, the, buddha, 19th, century, missionaries, studied, buddhism, to, be, more, effective, in, their, missionary, efforts, the, buddha, was, de, mystified, and, reduced, from, a, superhuman, to, a, compassionate, heroic, human, serving, western, historical, method, and, the, missionary, agenda, of, situating, the, buddha, firmly, below, the, divine, the, four, truths, were, discovered, by, the, british, by, reading, the, buddhist, texts, and, were, not, immediately, granted, the, central, position, they, later, received, the, writings, of, british, missionaries, show, a, growing, emphasis, on, the, four, truths, as, being, central, to, buddhism, with, somewhat, different, presentations, of, them, this, colonial, project, had, a, strong, influence, on, some, strands, of, buddhism, culminating, in, so, called, protestant, buddhism, which, incorporated, several, essentially, protestant, attitudes, regarding, religion, such, as, the, emphasis, on, written, texts, according, to, gimello, rahula, s, book, is, an, example, of, this, protestant, buddhism, and, was, created, in, an, accommodating, response, to, western, expectations, and, in, nearly, diametrical, opposition, to, buddhism, as, it, had, actually, been, practised, in, traditional, theravada, hendrik, kern, proposed, in, 1882, that, the, model, of, the, four, truths, may, be, an, analogy, with, classical, indian, medicine, in, which, the, four, truths, function, as, a, medical, diagnosis, and, the, buddha, is, presented, as, a, physician, kern, s, analogy, became, rather, popular, but, there, is, not, sufficient, historical, evidence, to, conclude, that, the, buddha, deliberately, drew, upon, a, clearly, defined, medical, model, for, his, fourfold, analysis, of, human, pain, according, to, anderson, those, scholars, who, did, not, place, the, four, truths, at, the, center, of, buddhism, either, located, the, four, truths, in, a, fuller, reading, of, the, theravada, canon, and, the, larger, context, of, south, asian, literature, or, located, the, teaching, within, an, experience, of, buddhism, as, practiced, in, a, contemporary, setting, according, to, anderson, these, autors, suggest, a, more, complex, reading, of, the, four, noble, truths, than, those, who, locate, the, teaching, as, the, key, to, or, as, a, crucial, element, within, the, grand, scheme, of, buddhism, the, developing, buddhist, tradition, inserted, the, four, truths, using, various, formulations, at, various, sutras, they, are, being, used, both, as, a, symbol, of, all, dhammas, and, the, buddha, s, awakening, and, as, a, set, of, propositions, which, function, within, a, matrix, of, teachings, according, to, anderson, there, is, no, single, way, to, understand, the, teachings, one, teaching, may, be, used, to, explain, another, teaching, and, vice, versa, the, teachings, form, a, network, which, should, be, apprehended, as, such, to, understand, how, the, various, teachings, intersect, with, each, other, the, mahasaccaka, sutta, the, greater, discourse, to, saccaka, majjhima, nikaya, 36, gives, one, of, several, versions, of, the, buddha, s, way, to, liberation, he, attains, the, three, knowledges, namely, knowledge, of, his, former, lifes, knowledge, of, death, and, rebirth, and, knowledge, of, the, destruction, of, the, taints, the, four, noble, truths, after, going, through, the, four, dhyanas, and, gaining, the, first, two, knowledges, the, story, proceeds, i, directed, my, mind, to, the, knowledge, of, the, destruction, of, the, intoxicants, my, mind, was, liberated, the, knowledge, arose, that, it, was, liberated, bronkhorst, dismisses, the, first, two, knowledges, as, later, additions, and, proceeds, to, notice, that, the, recognition, of, the, intoxicants, is, modelled, on, the, four, truths, according, to, bronkhorst, those, are, added, the, bridge, the, original, sequence, of, i, directed, my, mind, to, the, knowledge, of, the, destruction, of, the, intoxicants, my, mind, was, liberated, which, was, interrupted, by, the, addition, of, the, four, truths, bronkhorst, points, out, that, those, do, not, fit, here, since, the, four, truths, culminate, in, the, knowledge, of, the, path, to, be, followed, while, the, buddha, himself, is, already, liberated, at, that, point, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, the, first, talk, of, gautama, buddha, after, he, attained, enlightenment, is, recorded, in, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, setting, in, motion, the, wheel, of, dhamma, samyutta, nikaya, 56, 11, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, provides, details, on, three, stages, in, the, understanding, of, each, truth, for, a, total, of, twelve, insights, the, three, stages, for, understanding, each, truth, are, these, three, stages, of, understanding, are, emphasized, particularly, in, the, theravada, tradition, but, they, are, also, recognized, by, some, contemporary, mahayana, teachers, according, to, cousins, many, scholars, are, of, the, view, that, this, discourse, was, identified, as, the, first, sermon, of, the, buddha, only, at, a, later, date, according, to, stephen, batchelor, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, contains, incongruities, and, states, that, the, first, discourse, cannot, be, treated, as, a, verbatim, transcript, of, what, the, buddha, taught, in, the, deer, park, but, as, a, document, that, has, evolved, over, an, unspecified, period, of, time, until, it, reached, the, form, in, which, it, is, found, today, in, the, canons, of, the, different, buddhist, schools, according, to, bronkhorst, this, first, sermon, is, recorded, in, several, sutras, with, important, variations, in, the, vinaya, texts, and, in, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, which, was, influenced, by, the, vinaya, texts, the, four, truths, are, included, and, konda, a, is, enlightened, when, the, vision, of, dhamma, arises, in, him, whatever, is, subject, to, origination, is, all, subject, to, cessation, yet, in, the, ariyapariyesan, sutta, the, noble, search, majjhima, nikaya, 26, the, four, truths, are, not, included, and, the, buddha, gives, the, five, ascetics, personal, instructions, in, turn, two, or, three, of, them, while, the, others, go, out, begging, for, food, the, versions, of, the, first, sermon, which, include, the, four, truths, such, as, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, omit, this, instruction, showing, that, the, accounts, which, include, the, four, noble, truths, had, a, completely, different, conception, of, the, process, of, liberation, than, the, one, which, includes, the, four, dhyanas, and, the, subsequent, destruction, of, the, intoxicants, according, to, bronkhorst, this, indicates, that, the, four, truths, were, later, added, to, earlier, descriptions, of, liberation, by, practicing, the, four, dhyanas, which, originally, was, thought, to, be, sufficient, for, the, destruction, of, the, arsavas, anderson, following, norman, also, thinks, that, the, four, truths, originally, were, not, part, of, this, sutta, and, were, later, added, in, some, versions, according, to, bronkhorst, the, twelve, insights, are, probably, also, a, later, addition, born, out, of, unease, with, the, substitution, of, the, general, term, prajna, for, the, more, specific, four, truths, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, the, maha, parinibbana, sutta, last, days, of, the, buddha, digha, nikaya, 16, was, given, near, the, end, of, the, buddha, s, life, this, sutta, gives, a, good, general, idea, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, and, the, blessed, one, addressed, the, bhikkhus, saying, bhikkhus, it, is, through, not, realizing, through, not, penetrating, the, four, noble, truths, that, this, long, course, of, birth, and, death, has, been, passed, through, and, undergone, by, me, as, well, as, by, you, what, are, these, four, they, are, the, noble, truth, of, suffering, the, noble, truth, of, the, origin, of, suffering, the, noble, truth, of, the, cessation, of, suffering, and, the, noble, truth, of, the, way, to, the, cessation, of, suffering, but, now, bhikkhus, that, these, have, been, realized, and, penetrated, cut, off, is, the, craving, for, existence, destroyed, is, that, which, leads, to, renewed, becoming, and, there, is, no, fresh, becoming, thus, it, was, said, by, the, blessed, one, and, the, happy, one, the, master, further, said, through, not, seeing, the, four, noble, truths, long, was, the, weary, path, from, birth, to, birth, when, these, are, known, removed, is, rebirth, s, cause, the, root, of, sorrow, plucked, then, ends, rebirth, the, maha, salayatanika, sutta, majjhima, nikaya, 149, 3, plus, 149, 9, give, an, alternative, presentation, of, the, four, truths, when, one, abides, inflamed, by, lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating, gratification, ne, s, bodily, and, mental, troubles, increase, one, s, bodily, and, mental, torments, increase, one, s, bodily, and, mental, fevers, increase, and, one, experiences, bodily, and, mental, suffering, when, one, does, not, know, and, see, as, it, actually, is, felt, as, pleasant, or, painful, or, neither, painful, nor, pleasant, that, arises, with, eye, contact, as, condition, then, one, is, inflamed, by, lust, for, the, eye, for, forms, for, eye, consciousness, for, eye, contact, for, felt, as, pleasant, or, painful, or, neither, painful, nor, pleasant, that, arises, with, eye, contact, as, condition, when, one, abides, uninflamed, by, lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating, danger, one, s, craving, is, abandoned, one, s, bodily, and, mental, troubles, are, abandoned, one, s, bodily, and, mental, torments, are, abandoned, one, s, bodily, and, mental, fevers, are, abandoned, and, one, experiences, bodily, and, mental, pleasure, when, one, knows, and, see, as, it, actually, is, felt, as, pleasant, or, painful, or, neither, painful, nor, pleasant, that, arises, with, eye, contact, as, condition, then, one, is, not, inflamed, by, lust, for, the, eye, for, forms, for, eye, consciousness, for, eye, contact, for, felt, as, pleasant, or, painful, or, neither, painful, nor, pleasant, that, arises, with, eye, contact, as, condition, the, ekavy, vah, rika, sect, emphasized, the, transcendence, of, the, buddha, asserting, that, he, was, eternally, enlightened, and, essentially, non, physical, according, to, the, ekavy, vah, rika, the, words, of, the, buddha, were, spoken, with, one, transcendent, meaning, and, the, four, noble, truths, are, to, be, understood, simultaneously, in, one, moment, of, insight, according, to, the, mah, saka, sect, the, four, noble, truths, should, be, meditated, upon, simultaneously, according, to, carol, anderson, the, four, truths, have, a, singular, position, within, the, theravada, canon, and, tradition, the, theravada, tradition, regards, insight, in, the, four, truths, as, liberating, in, itself, as, walpola, rahula, states, when, the, truth, is, seen, all, the, forces, which, feverishly, produce, the, continuity, of, samsara, in, illusion, become, calm, and, incapable, of, producing, any, more, karma, formations, he, is, free, from, the, thirst, for, becoming, this, liberation, can, be, attained, in, one, single, moment, when, the, four, truths, are, understood, together, within, the, theravada, tradition, great, emphasis, is, placed, upon, reading, and, contemplating, the, discourse, that, sets, turning, the, wheel, of, truth, and, other, suttas, as, a, means, to, study, the, four, noble, truths, and, put, them, into, practice, for, example, ajahn, sumedho, states, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, the, buddha, s, teaching, on, the, four, noble, truths, has, been, the, main, reference, that, i, have, used, for, my, practice, over, the, years, it, is, the, teaching, we, used, in, our, monastery, in, thailand, the, theravada, school, of, buddhism, regards, this, sutta, as, the, quintessence, of, the, teachings, of, the, buddha, this, one, sutta, contains, all, that, is, necessary, for, understanding, the, dhamma, and, for, enlightenment, within, the, theravada, tradition, three, different, stances, on, nirvana, and, the, question, what, happens, with, the, arhat, after, death, can, be, found, nirvana, refers, to, the, cessation, of, the, defilements, and, the, resulting, peace, of, mind, and, happiness, khlesa, nirvana, to, the, final, dissolution, of, the, five, skandhas, at, the, time, of, death, skandha, nirvana, or, parinirvana, and, to, a, transcendental, reality, which, is, known, at, the, moment, of, awakening, according, to, gethin, modern, buddhist, usage, tends, to, restrict, nirv, a, to, the, awakening, experience, and, reserve, parinirv, a, for, the, death, experience, according, to, geisler, and, amano, in, the, minimal, theravada, interpretation, nirvana, is, a, psychological, state, which, ends, with, the, dissolution, of, the, body, and, the, total, extinction, of, existence, according, to, geisler, and, amano, the, orthodox, theravada, interpretation, is, that, nirvana, is, a, transcendent, reality, with, which, the, self, unites, according, to, bronkhorst, while, buddhism, preached, liberation, in, this, life, i, e, before, death, there, was, also, a, tendency, in, buddhism, to, think, of, liberation, happening, after, death, according, to, bronkhorst, this, becomes, visible, in, those, canonical, passages, which, distinguish, between, nirvana, qualified, in, sanskrit, and, pali, as, without, a, remainder, of, upadhi, upadi, anupadhisesa, anupadisesa, and, the, highest, and, complete, enlightenment, anuttara, samyaksambodhi, sammasambodhi, the, former, occurs, at, death, the, latter, in, life, according, to, walpola, rahula, the, cessation, of, dukkha, is, nirvana, the, summum, bonum, of, buddhism, and, is, attained, in, this, life, not, when, one, dies, nirvana, is, perfect, freedom, peace, tranquility, and, happiness, and, absolute, truth, which, simply, is, jayatilleke, also, speaks, of, the, attainment, of, an, ultimate, reality, according, to, bhikkhu, bodhi, the, elimination, of, craving, culminates, not, only, in, the, extinction, of, sorrow, anguish, and, distress, but, in, the, unconditioned, freedom, of, nibbana, which, is, won, with, the, ending, of, repeated, rebirth, according, to, spiro, most, lay, theravada, buddhists, do, not, aspire, for, nirvana, and, total, extinction, but, for, a, pleasurable, rebirth, in, heaven, according, to, spiro, this, presents, a, serious, conflict, since, the, buddhist, texts, and, teaching, describe, life, as, suffering, and, hold, up, nirvana, as, the, summum, bonum, in, response, to, this, deviation, monks, and, others, emphasize, that, the, hope, for, nirvana, is, the, only, legitimate, action, for, buddhist, action, nevertheless, according, to, spiro, most, burmese, lay, buddhists, do, not, aspire, for, the, extinction, of, existence, which, is, nirvana, according, to, b, r, ambedkar, the, indian, buddhist, dalit, leader, the, four, truths, were, not, part, of, the, original, teachings, of, the, buddha, but, a, later, aggregation, due, to, hindu, influences, according, to, ambedkar, total, cessation, of, suffering, is, an, illusion, yet, the, buddhist, middle, path, aims, at, the, reduction, of, suffering, and, the, maximizing, of, happiness, balancing, both, sorrow, and, happiness, the, four, truths, are, less, prominent, in, the, mahayana, traditions, which, emphasize, insight, into, nyat, and, the, bodhisattva, path, as, a, central, elements, in, their, teachings, if, the, sutras, in, general, are, studied, at, all, it, is, through, various, mahayana, commentaries, according, to, makransky, the, mahayana, bodhisattva, ideal, created, tensions, in, the, explanation, of, the, four, truths, in, the, mahayana, view, a, fully, enlightened, buddha, does, not, leave, samsara, but, remains, in, the, world, out, of, compassion, for, all, sentient, beings, the, four, truths, which, aim, at, ending, samsara, do, not, provide, a, doctrinal, basis, for, this, view, and, had, to, be, reinterpreted, in, the, old, view, klesas, and, karma, are, the, cause, of, prolonged, existence, according, to, makransky, o, remove, those, causes, was, at, physical, death, to, extinguish, one, s, conditioned, existence, hence, to, end, forever, one, s, participation, in, the, world, third, truth, according, to, makransky, the, question, of, how, a, liberated, being, can, still, be, pervasively, operative, in, this, world, has, been, a, seminal, source, of, ongoing, doctrinal, tension, over, buddhahood, throughout, the, history, of, the, mahayana, in, india, and, tibet, atisha, in, his, bodhipathaprad, pa, a, lamp, for, the, path, to, awakening, which, forms, the, basis, for, the, lamrim, tradition, discerns, three, levels, of, motivation, for, buddhist, practitioners, at, the, beginning, level, of, motivation, one, strives, toward, a, better, life, in, samsara, at, the, intermediate, level, one, strives, to, a, liberation, from, existence, in, samsara, and, the, end, of, all, suffering, at, the, highest, level, of, motivation, one, strives, after, the, liberation, of, all, living, beings, in, his, commentary, on, the, text, tsenshap, serkong, rinpoche, explains, that, the, four, truths, are, to, be, meditated, upon, as, a, means, of, practice, for, the, intermediate, level, according, to, geshe, tashi, tsering, within, tibetan, buddhism, the, four, noble, truths, are, studied, as, part, of, the, bodhisattva, path, they, are, explained, in, mahayana, commentaries, such, as, the, abhisamayalamkara, a, summary, of, and, commentary, on, the, prajna, paramita, sutras, where, they, form, part, of, the, lower, hinayana, teachings, the, truth, of, the, path, the, fourth, truth, is, traditionally, presented, according, to, a, progressive, formula, of, five, paths, rather, than, as, the, eightfold, path, presented, in, theravada, according, to, tsering, the, study, of, the, four, truths, is, combined, with, the, study, of, the, sixteen, characteristics, of, the, four, noble, truths, some, contemporary, tibetan, buddhist, teachers, have, provided, commentary, on, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, and, the, noble, eightfold, path, when, presenting, the, dharma, to, western, students, nichiren, buddhism, is, based, on, the, teaching, of, the, japanese, priest, and, teacher, nichiren, who, believed, that, the, lotus, s, tra, contained, the, essence, of, all, of, gautama, buddha, s, teachings, the, third, chapter, of, the, lotus, sutra, states, that, the, four, noble, truths, was, the, early, teaching, of, the, buddha, while, the, dharma, of, the, lotus, is, the, most, wonderful, unsurpassed, great, dharma, the, teachings, on, the, four, noble, truths, are, a, provisional, teaching, which, shakyamuni, buddha, taught, according, to, the, people, s, capacity, while, the, lotus, sutra, is, a, direct, statement, of, shakyamuni, s, own, enlightenment, for, many, western, buddhists, the, rebirth, doctrine, in, the, four, noble, truths, teaching, is, a, problematic, notion, according, to, lamb, certain, forms, of, modern, western, buddhism, see, it, as, purely, mythical, and, thus, a, dispensable, notion, according, to, coleman, the, focus, of, most, vipassana, students, in, the, west, is, mainly, on, meditation, practice, and, a, kind, of, down, to, earth, psychological, wisdom, according, to, damien, keown, westerners, find, the, ideas, of, karma, and, rebirth, puzzling, according, to, gowans, many, western, followers, and, people, interested, in, exploring, buddhism, are, skeptical, and, object, to, the, belief, in, karma, and, rebirth, foundational, to, the, four, noble, truths, according, to, konik, since, the, fundamental, problems, underlying, early, indian, buddhism, and, contemporary, western, buddhism, are, not, the, same, the, validity, of, applying, the, set, of, solutions, developed, by, the, first, to, the, situation, of, the, second, becomes, a, question, of, great, importance, simply, putting, an, end, to, rebirth, would, not, necessarily, strike, the, western, buddhist, as, the, ultimate, answer, as, it, certainly, was, for, early, indian, buddhists, according, to, keown, it, is, possible, to, reinterpret, the, buddhist, doctrines, such, as, the, four, noble, truths, since, the, final, goal, and, the, answer, to, the, problem, of, suffering, is, nirvana, and, not, rebirth, some, western, interpreters, have, proposed, what, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, naturalized, buddhism, it, is, devoid, of, rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms, of, existence, and, other, concepts, of, buddhism, with, doctrines, such, as, the, four, noble, truths, reformulated, and, restated, in, modernistic, terms, this, deflated, secular, buddhism, stresses, compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless, persons, no, boddhisattvas, no, nirvana, no, rebirth, and, a, naturalist, s, approach, to, well, being, of, oneself, and, others, according, to, melford, spiro, this, approach, undermines, the, four, noble, truths, for, it, does, not, address, the, existential, question, for, the, buddhist, as, to, why, live, why, not, commit, suicide, hasten, the, end, of, dukkha, in, current, life, by, ending, life, in, traditional, buddhism, rebirth, continues, the, dukkha, and, the, path, to, cessation, of, dukkha, isn, t, suicide, but, the, fourth, reality, of, the, four, noble, truths, the, naturalized, buddhism, according, to, gowans, is, a, radical, revision, to, traditional, buddhist, thought, and, practice, and, it, attacks, the, structure, behind, the, hopes, needs, and, rationalization, of, the, realities, of, human, life, to, traditional, buddhists, in, east, southeast, and, south, asia, according, to, keown, it, may, not, be, necessary, to, believe, in, some, of, the, core, buddhist, doctrines, to, be, a, buddhist, but, the, rebirth, karma, realms, of, existence, and, cyclic, universe, doctrines, underpin, the, four, noble, truths, in, buddhism, traditional, buddhist, scholars, disagree, with, these, modernist, western, interpretations, bhikkhu, bodhi, for, example, states, that, rebirth, is, an, integral, part, of, the, buddhist, teachings, as, found, in, the, sutras, despite, the, problems, that, modernist, interpreters, of, buddhism, seem, to, have, with, it, thanissaro, bhikkhu, as, another, example, rejects, the, modern, argument, that, one, can, still, obtain, all, the, results, of, the, practice, without, having, to, accept, the, possibility, of, rebirth, he, states, rebirth, has, always, been, a, central, teaching, in, the, buddhist, tradition, according, to, owen, flanagan, the, dalai, lama, states, that, buddhists, believe, in, rebirth, and, that, this, belief, has, been, common, among, his, followers, however, the, dalai, lama, s, belief, adds, flanagan, is, more, sophisticated, than, ordinary, buddhists, because, it, is, not, the, same, as, reincarnation, rebirth, in, buddhism, is, envisioned, as, happening, without, the, assumption, of, an, atman, self, soul, but, rather, through, a, consciousness, conceived, along, the, anatman, lines, the, doctrine, of, rebirth, is, considered, mandatory, in, tibetan, buddhism, and, across, many, buddhist, sects, according, to, christopher, gowans, for, most, ordinary, buddhists, today, as, well, as, in, the, past, their, basic, moral, orientation, is, governed, by, belief, in, karma, and, rebirth, buddhist, morality, hinges, on, the, hope, of, well, being, in, this, lifetime, or, in, future, rebirths, with, nirvana, enlightenment, a, project, for, a, future, lifetime, a, denial, of, karma, and, rebirth, undermines, their, history, moral, orientation, and, religious, foundations, according, to, keown, most, buddhists, in, asia, do, accept, these, traditional, teachings, and, seek, better, rebirth, the, navayana, a, modernistic, interpretation, of, buddhism, by, the, indian, leader, and, buddhist, scholar, b, r, ambedkar, rejected, much, of, traditional, buddhism, including, the, four, noble, truths, karma, and, rebirth, thus, turning, his, new, religion, into, a, vehicle, for, class, struggle, and, social, action, according, to, ambedkar, four, noble, truths, was, the, invention, of, wrong, headed, monks, through, not, seeing, the, four, noble, truths, long, was, the, weary, path, from, birth, to, birth, when, these, are, known, removed, is, rebirth, s, cause, the, root, of, sorrow, plucked, then, ends, rebirth, if, nirv, a, is, to, be, expressed, and, explained, in, positive, terms, we, are, likely, immediately, to, grasp, an, idea, associated, with, those, terms, which, may, be, quite, the, contrary, therefore, it, is, generally, expressed, in, negative, terms, because, nirvana, is, thus, expressed, in, negative, terms, there, are, many, who, have, got, a, wrong, notion, that, it, is, negative, and, expresses, self, annihilation, nirv, a, is, definitely, no, annihilation, of, self, because, there, is, no, self, to, annihilate, if, at, all, it, is, the, annihilation, of, the, illusion, of, the, false, idea, of, self, it, is, incorrect, to, say, that, nirv, a, is, negative, or, positive, the, ideas, of, negative, and, positive, are, relative, and, are, within, the, realm, of, duality, these, terms, cannot, be, applied, to, nirv, a, absolute, truth, which, is, beyond, duality, and, relativity, nirv, a, is, neither, cause, nor, effect, it, is, beyond, cause, and, effect, truth, is, not, a, result, nor, an, effect, it, is, not, produced, like, a, mystic, spiritual, mental, state, such, as, dhy, na, or, sam, dhi, truth, is, nirv, a, is, rahula, refers, to, the, dh, tuvibha, ga, sutta, the, majjhima, nik, ya, 140, for, his, interpretation, of, nirv, a, as, absolute, truth, which, according, to, rahula, says, o, bhikkhu, that, which, is, unreality, mosadhamma, is, false, that, which, is, reality, amosadhamma, nibb, na, is, truth, sacca, therefore, o, bhikkhu, a, person, so, endowed, is, endowed, with, this, absolute, truth, for, the, absolute, noble, truth, parama, ariyasacca, is, nibb, na, which, is, reality, while, jayatilleke, translates, amosadhamma, as, ineffable, thanissaro, bhikkhu, gives, a, somewhat, different, translation, his, release, being, founded, on, truth, does, not, fluctuate, for, whatever, is, deceptive, is, false, unbinding, the, undeceptive, is, true, thus, a, monk, so, endowed, is, endowed, with, the, highest, determination, for, truth, for, this, unbinding, the, undeceptive, is, the, highest, noble, truth, in, response, to, rahula, richard, gombrich, states, that, in, proclaiming, in, block, capitals, that, truth, is, rahula, has, for, a, moment, fallen, into, upanisadic, mode, since, truth, can, only, be, a, property, of, propositions, which, have, subjects, and, predicates, and, nirvana, is, not, a, proposition, it, makes, no, sense, in, english, to, say, that, nirvana, is, truth, the, confusion, arises, perhaps, because, the, sanskrit, word, satyam, and, the, corresponding, pali, word, saccam, can, indeed, mean, either, truth, or, reality, but, in, our, language, this, will, not, work, richard, gombrich, also, states, that, rahula, s, book, would, more, aptly, be, titled, what, buddhagosa, taught, according, to, david, kalupahana, buddhagosa, was, influenced, by, mahayana, buddhism, and, introduced, the, substantialist, as, well, as, essentialist, standpoints, of, the, sarvastavadins, and, sautrantikas, no, doubt, according, to, the, early, indian, buddhist, tradition, the, buddha, s, great, discovery, as, condensed, in, his, experience, of, nirvana, involved, the, remembrance, of, his, many, former, existences, presupposing, as, fact, the, reality, of, a, never, ending, process, of, rebirth, as, a, source, of, deep, anxiety, and, an, acceptance, of, the, buddha, s, overcoming, of, that, fate, as, ultimate, liberation
