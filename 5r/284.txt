story, is, more, distinctly, the, creation, of, one, mind, there, has, been, discussion, as, to, whether, the, first, and, the, last, volumes, of, valmiki, s, ramayana, bala, kanda, and, uttara, kanda, were, composed, by, the, original, author, though, bala, kanda, is, sometimes, considered, in, the, main, epic, according, to, many, uttara, kanda, is, certainly, a, later, interpolation, not, attributable, to, valmiki, both, of, these, two, k, ndas, are, absent, in, the, oldest, manuscript, some, think, that, the, uttara, kanda, contradicts, how, rama, and, dharma, are, portrayed, in, the, rest, of, the, epic, m, r, parameswaran, says, that, the, way, the, positions, of, women, and, shudras, are, depicted, shows, that, the, uttara, kanda, is, a, later, insertion, since, rama, was, revered, as, a, dharmatma, his, ideas, seen, in, the, ramayana, proper, cannot, be, replaced, by, new, ideas, as, to, what, dharma, is, except, by, claiming, that, he, himself, adopted, those, new, ideas, that, is, what, the, u, k, does, it, embodies, the, new, ideas, in, two, stories, that, are, usually, referred, to, as, sita, parityaga, the, abandonment, of, sita, after, rama, and, sita,

rama, s, rule, itself, was, r, ma, r, jya, described, to, be, a, just, and, fair, rule, it, is, believed, by, many, that, when, rama, returned, people, celebrated, their, happiness, with, diyas, and, the, festival, of, deepavali, is, connected, with, r, ma, s, return, scholars, note, linguistic, and, rhetorical, differences, between, the, uttara, kanda, and, books, 2, through, 6, of, the, ramayana, especially, in, stories, such, as, sita, s, exile, and, death, of, shambuka, and, together, with, bala, kanda, it, is, considered, by, some, scholars, to, be, an, interpolation, and, that, the, original, poem, ended, with, the, yuddhakanda, this, kanda, narrates, rama, s, reign, of, ayodhya, the, birth, of, lava, and, kusha, the, ashvamedha, yajna, and, last, days, of, rama, at, the,

perhaps, this, is, because, rama, a, liberated, jain, self, in, his, last, life, is, unwilling, to, kill, instead, it, is, lakshmana, who, kills, ravana, as, vasudeva, killes, prativasudeva, in, the, end, rama, who, led, an, upright, life, renounces, his, kingdom, becomes, a, jain, monk, and, attains, moksha, on, the, other, hand, lakshmana, and, ravana, go, to, hell, however, it, is, predicted, that, ultimately, they, both, will, be, reborn, as, upright, persons, and, attain, liberation, in, their, future, births, according, to, jain, texts, ravana, will, be, the, future, tirthankara, omniscient, teacher, of, jainism, the, jain, versions, have, some, variations, from, valmiki, s, ramayana, dasharatha, the, king, of, ayodhya, had, four, queens, aparajita, sumitra, suprabha, and, kaikeyi, these, four, queens, had, four, sons, aparajita, s, son, was, padma, and, he, became, known, by, the, name, of, rama, sumitra, s, son, was, narayana, he, came, to, be, known, by, another,

had, four, chief, queens, maithili, prabhavati, ratinibha, and, sridama, furthermore, sita, takes, renunciation, as, a, jain, ascetic, after, rama, abandons, her, and, is, reborn, in, heaven, as, indra, rama, after, lakshman, s, death, also, renounces, his, kingdom, and, becomes, a, jain, monk, ultimately, he, attains, kevala, jnana, omniscience, and, finally, liberation, rama, predicts, that, ravana, and, lakshmana, who, were, in, the, fourth, hell, will, attain, liberation, in, their, future, births, accordingly, ravana, is, the, future, tirthankara, of, the, next, half, ascending, time,
