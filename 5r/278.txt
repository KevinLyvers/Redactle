says, the, word, nirv, a, is, from, the, verbal, root, v, blow, in, the, form, of, past, participle, v, na, blown, prefixed, with, the, preverb, nis, meaning, out, hence, the, original, meaning, of, the, word, is, blown, out, extinguished, sandhi, changes, the, sounds, the, v, of, v, na, causes, nis, to, become, nir, and, then, the, r, of, nir, causes, retroflexion, of, the, following, n, nis, v,

buddhism, where, the, ultimate, aim, is, the, timeless, state, of, moksa, or, as, the, buddhists, first, seem, to, have, called, it, nirvana, although, the, term, occurs, in, the, literatures, of, a, number, of, ancient, indian, traditions, the, concept, is, most, commonly, associated, with, buddhism, some, writers, believe, the, concept, was, adopted, by, other, indian, religions, after, it,

an, afterlife, in, heaven, and, hell, based, on, cumulative, virtues, merit, or, vices, demerit, however, the, ancient, vedic, rishis, challenged, this, idea, of, afterlife, as, simplistic, because, people, do, not, live, an, equally, moral, or, immoral, life, between, generally, virtuous, lives, some, are, more, virtuous, while, evil, too, has, degrees, and, either, permanent, heaven, or, permanent, hell, is, disproportionate, the, vedic, thinkers, introduced, the, idea, of, an, afterlife, in, heaven, or, hell, in, proportion, to, one, s, merit, and, when, this, runs, out, one,
