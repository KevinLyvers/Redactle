burial, also, known, as, interment, or, inhumation, is, a, method, of, final, disposition, whereby, a, dead, body, is, placed, into, the, ground, sometimes, with, objects, this, is, usually, accomplished, by, excavating, a, pit, or, trench, placing, the, deceased, and, objects, in, it, and, covering, it, over, a, funeral, is, a, ceremony, that, accompanies, the, final, disposition, evidence, suggests, that, some, archaic, and, early, modern, humans, buried, their, dead, burial, is, often, seen, as, indicating, respect, for, the, dead, it, has, been, used, to, prevent, the, odor, of, decay, to, give, family, members, closure, and, prevent, them, from, witnessing, the, decomposition, of, their, loved, ones, and, in, many, cultures, it, has, been, seen, as, a, necessary, step, for, the, deceased, to, enter, the, afterlife, or, to, give, back, to, the, cycle, of, life, methods, of, burial, may, be, heavily, ritualized, and, can, include, natural, burial, sometimes, called, green, burial, embalming, or, mummification, and, the, use, of, containers, for, the, dead, such, as, shrouds, coffins, grave, liners, and, burial, vaults, all, of, which, can, slow, decomposition, of, the, body, sometimes, objects, or, grave, goods, are, buried, with, the, body, which, may, be, dressed, in, fancy, or, ceremonial, garb, depending, on, the, culture, the, manner, in, which, the, body, is, positioned, may, have, great, significance, the, location, of, the, burial, may, be, determined, by, taking, into, account, concerns, surrounding, health, and, sanitation, religious, concerns, and, cultural, practices, some, cultures, keep, the, dead, close, to, provide, guidance, to, the, living, while, others, banish, them, by, locating, burial, grounds, at, a, distance, from, inhabited, areas, some, religions, consecrate, special, ground, to, bury, the, dead, and, some, families, build, private, family, cemeteries, most, modern, cultures, document, the, location, of, graves, with, headstones, which, may, be, inscribed, with, information, and, tributes, to, the, deceased, however, some, people, are, buried, in, anonymous, or, secret, graves, for, various, reasons, sometimes, multiple, bodies, are, buried, in, a, single, grave, either, by, choice, as, in, the, case, of, married, couples, due, to, space, concerns, or, in, the, case, of, mass, graves, as, a, way, to, deal, with, many, bodies, at, once, alternatives, to, burial, include, cremation, and, subsequent, interment, burial, at, sea, and, cryopreservation, some, human, cultures, may, bury, the, remains, of, beloved, animals, intentional, burial, particularly, with, grave, goods, may, be, one, of, the, earliest, detectable, forms, of, religious, practice, since, as, philip, lieberman, suggests, it, may, signify, a, concern, for, the, dead, that, transcends, daily, life, evidence, points, to, the, neanderthals, as, the, first, human, species, known, to, practice, burial, behavior, and, to, intentionally, bury, their, dead, they, did, so, using, shallow, graves, furnished, with, stone, tools, and, animal, bones, exemplary, sites, include, shanidar, in, iraq, kebara, cave, in, israel, and, krapina, in, croatia, some, scholars, however, argue, that, such, buried, bodies, may, have, been, disposed, of, for, secular, reasons, though, there, is, ongoing, debate, regarding, the, reliability, of, the, dating, method, some, scholars, believe, the, earliest, human, burial, dates, back, 100, 000, years, archeological, expeditions, have, discovered, human, skeletal, remains, stained, with, red, ochre, in, the, skhul, cave, at, qafzeh, in, israel, a, variety, of, grave, goods, were, present, at, the, site, including, the, mandible, of, a, wild, boar, in, the, arms, of, one, of, the, skeletons, the, remains, of, a, 3, year, old, child, at, panga, ya, saidi, cave, in, kenya, dating, to, 78, 000, years, ago, also, show, signs, suggestive, of, a, burial, such, as, the, digging, of, a, pit, laying, of, the, body, in, a, fetal, position, and, intentional, rapid, covering, of, the, corpse, in, ancient, egypt, burial, customs, developed, during, the, predynastic, period, round, graves, with, one, pot, were, used, in, the, badarian, period, 4400, 3800, b, c, e, continuing, the, tradition, of, omari, and, maadi, cultures, archeologists, refer, to, unmarked, prehistoric, cemeteries, using, the, neutral, term, grave, field, grave, fields, are, one, of, the, chief, sources, of, information, on, prehistoric, cultures, and, numerous, archaeological, cultures, are, labelled, and, defined, by, their, burial, customs, such, as, the, urnfield, culture, of, the, european, bronze, age, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, reopening, of, graves, and, manipulation, of, the, corpses, or, artifacts, contained, within, them, was, a, widespread, phenomenon, and, a, common, part, of, the, life, course, of, early, medieval, cemeteries, across, western, and, central, europe, the, reopening, of, furnished, or, recent, burials, occurred, especially, from, the, 5th, to, the, 8th, centuries, ce, over, the, broad, zone, of, european, row, grave, style, furnished, inhumation, burial, which, comprised, the, regions, of, romania, hungary, the, czech, republic, slovakia, switzerland, austria, germany, the, low, countries, france, and, south, eastern, england, medieval, european, christianity, sometimes, developed, complex, burial, rituals, and, attached, great, importance, to, their, correct, performance, the, fate, of, the, soul, of, the, deceased, might, depend, on, observing, the, proper, ceremonial, for, example, if, you, were, to, make, it, to, heaven, you, had, to, be, interred, correctly, for, burial, was, the, passage, out, of, this, world, the, body, had, to, be, shrouded, in, the, expectation, that, it, would, be, reborn, into, eternal, life, then, on, the, eve, of, burial, the, corpse, had, to, be, taken, to, church, on, a, torch, lit, bier, and, placed, in, the, darkness, of, the, nave, then, laid, in, front, of, the, high, altar, surrounded, by, candles, the, next, day, in, front, of, the, whole, community, a, requiem, mass, was, to, be, sung, and, the, paschal, candle, lit, following, this, there, were, prayers, hymns, special, masses, and, the, body, was, borne, to, the, grave, sprinkled, with, holy, water, and, buried, in, consecrated, ground, it, must, be, laid, head, up, with, its, feet, to, the, east, for, it, was, from, this, direction, that, christ, would, return, from, new, jerusalem, at, the, apocalypse, when, the, worthy, dead, would, be, resurrected, if, burial, rituals, went, awry, one, s, immortal, soul, was, jeopardised, personal, salvation, breaking, free, from, the, corporeal, prison, and, ascending, to, a, spiritual, sphere, unencumbered, by, materiality, is, the, logical, culmination, of, the, myth, of, humanity, s, supposed, dominion, over, nature, after, death, a, body, will, decay, burial, is, not, necessarily, a, public, health, requirement, contrary, to, conventional, wisdom, the, world, health, organization, advises, that, only, corpses, carrying, an, infectious, disease, strictly, require, burial, human, burial, practices, are, the, manifestation, of, the, human, desire, to, demonstrate, respect, for, the, dead, cultures, vary, in, their, mode, of, respect, some, reasons, follow, in, many, cultures, human, corpses, were, usually, buried, in, soil, the, roots, of, burial, as, a, practice, reach, back, into, the, middle, palaeolithic, and, coincide, with, the, appearance, of, homo, neanderthalensis, and, homo, sapiens, in, europe, and, africa, respectively, as, a, result, burial, grounds, are, found, throughout, the, world, through, time, mounds, of, earth, temples, and, caverns, were, used, to, store, the, dead, bodies, of, ancestors, in, modern, times, the, custom, of, burying, dead, people, below, ground, with, a, stone, marker, to, indicate, the, burial, place, is, used, in, most, cultures, although, other, means, such, as, cremation, are, becoming, more, popular, in, the, west, cremation, is, the, norm, in, india, and, mandatory, in, big, metropolitan, areas, of, japan, some, burial, practices, are, heavily, ritualized, others, are, simply, practical, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, graves, must, be, dug, to, a, depth, of, six, feet, 1, 8, metres, this, is, reflected, in, the, common, euphemism, for, death, of, six, feet, under, in, fact, graves, are, rarely, dug, to, this, depth, except, when, it, is, intended, to, later, bury, a, further, coffin, or, coffins, on, top, of, the, first, one, in, such, cases, more, than, six, feet, may, be, dug, to, provide, the, required, depth, of, soil, above, the, top, coffin, in, the, united, states, there, is, no, nationwide, regulation, of, burial, depth, each, local, authority, is, free, to, determine, its, own, rules, requirements, for, depth, can, vary, according, to, soil, type, and, by, method, of, burial, california, for, instance, requires, only, 19, inches, of, soil, above, the, top, of, the, coffin, but, more, commonly, 30, to, 36, inches, are, required, in, other, places, in, some, areas, such, as, central, appalachia, graves, were, indeed, once, dug, to, a, depth, of, six, feet, to, prevent, the, body, being, disturbed, by, burrowing, animals, however, this, was, unnecessary, once, metal, caskets, and, concrete, vaults, started, to, be, used, in, the, united, kingdom, soil, is, required, to, be, to, a, depth, of, three, feet, above, the, highest, point, of, the, coffin, unless, the, burial, authority, consider, the, soil, to, be, suitable, for, a, depth, of, only, two, feet, the, earliest, known, reference, to, a, requirement, for, a, six, foot, burial, occurred, in, 1665, during, the, great, plague, of, london, john, lawrence, the, lord, mayor, of, london, ordered, that, the, bodies, of, plague, victims, shall, be, at, least, six, foot, deep, the, city, officials, apparently, believed, this, would, inhibit, the, spread, of, the, disease, not, realising, that, the, true, vector, was, fleas, living, on, rats, in, the, streets, in, the, event, there, were, so, many, victims, that, very, few, were, buried, in, individual, graves, most, were, placed, in, massive, plague, pits, so, it, is, unlikely, that, this, event, alone, gave, rise, to, the, six, feet, tradition, natural, burial, also, called, green, burial, is, the, process, by, which, a, body, is, returned, to, the, earth, to, decompose, naturally, in, soil, and, in, some, cases, even, protect, native, and, endangered, wildlife, natural, burial, became, popularized, in, the, uk, in, the, early, 1990s, by, ken, west, a, professional, cremator, operator, for, the, city, of, carlisle, responding, to, the, u, k, s, call, for, changes, in, government, that, aligned, with, the, united, nations, environmental, program, local, agenda, 21, in, addition, there, are, multiple, green, burial, sites, in, the, u, s, green, burials, are, developing, in, canada, victoria, bc, and, cobourg, ontario, as, well, as, in, australia, and, ireland, the, increase, in, popularity, of, alternative, burials, can, be, seen, as, a, direct, choice, of, the, individual, s, want, to, distance, themselves, from, religious, practices, and, spiritual, locations, as, well, as, an, opportunity, to, exercise, their, act, of, choice, the, desire, to, live, through, nature, as, well, as, concern, for, the, environment, have, been, the, backbone, of, the, green, burial, movement, the, use, of, coffins, made, from, alternative, materials, such, as, wicker, and, biodegradable, materials, as, well, as, trees, and, other, flora, are, being, used, in, place, of, headstones, both, practices, provide, sustainable, alternatives, to, traditional, burial, practices, natural, burials, have, been, attracting, people, for, reasons, outside, of, environmental, and, sustainability, factors, as, well, with, the, expansion, of, urban, centres, ecological, corridors, gradually, disappear, cemeteries, for, burial, plots, preclude, alternative, uses, of, the, land, for, a, long, time, by, combining, these, two, aspects, need, for, connectivity, and, land, take, imposed, by, cemeteries, two, positive, results, can, be, achieved, protecting, memories, of, the, past, and, connecting, ecosystems, with, multiple, use, corridors, green, burials, appeal, to, people, for, economic, reasons, traditional, burial, practices, can, be, a, financial, burden, causing, some, to, turn, to, green, burials, as, a, cheaper, alternative, some, people, view, green, burials, as, more, meaningful, especially, for, those, who, have, a, connection, to, a, piece, of, land, such, as, current, residence, or, other, places, that, hold, meaning, for, them, conservation, burial, is, a, type, of, burial, where, burial, fees, fund, the, acquisition, and, management, of, new, land, to, benefit, native, habitat, ecosystems, and, species, this, usually, involves, a, legal, document, such, as, a, conservation, easement, such, burials, go, beyond, other, forms, of, natural, burial, which, aim, to, prevent, environmental, damage, caused, by, conventional, burial, techniques, by, actually, increasing, benefits, for, the, environment, the, idea, is, for, the, burial, process, to, be, a, net, positive, for, the, earth, rather, than, just, neutral, scientists, have, argued, that, such, burials, could, potentially, generate, enough, funds, to, save, every, endangered, species, on, the, planet, the, green, burial, council, certifies, natural, and, conservation, burial, grounds, in, the, u, s, and, canada, the, memorial, reef, is, a, natural, alternative, approach, to, burial, the, cremated, remains, of, a, person, are, mixed, in, with, concrete, and, then, placed, into, a, mold, to, make, the, memorial, reef, or, eternal, reef, after, the, concrete, sets, family, members, are, allowed, to, customize, the, reef, with, writing, hand, prints, and, chalk, drawings, after, this, the, eco, friendly, reefs, are, placed, into, the, ocean, among, other, coral, reefs, where, they, help, to, repair, damage, to, the, reefs, while, also, providing, new, habitats, for, fish, and, other, sea, communities, it, has, become, a, new, way, to, memorialize, the, passing, person, while, also, protecting, the, marine, environment, the, high, cost, of, the, memorial, reefs, has, caused, this, alternative, form, of, burial, to, remain, minimal, and, uncommon, this, kind, of, natural, burial, is, practiced, in, permitted, oceans, in, the, u, s, specifically, in, locations, around, florida, south, carolina, north, carolina, maryland, new, jersey, texas, and, virginia, alkaline, hydrolysis, also, referred, to, as, resomation, is, another, approach, to, natural, burial, it, uses, high, temperature, water, mixed, with, potassium, hydroxide, to, dissolve, human, remains, during, this, process, the, body, is, put, into, an, enclosed, stainless, steel, chamber, the, chamber, fills, with, the, chemical, and, water, solution, and, is, then, lightly, circulated, after, a, couple, of, hours, the, body, is, worn, down, and, bone, is, the, only, thing, that, remains, the, bones, are, then, pressed, down, into, a, powder, and, returned, to, the, associated, family, the, outcome, is, comparable, to, cremation, but, results, in, an, environmentally, friendly, process, that, does, not, release, chemical, emissions, and, greenhouse, gases, into, the, atmosphere, as, was, confirmed, after, a, review, by, the, health, council, of, the, netherlands, after, this, process, the, water, used, goes, to, a, regular, water, treatment, facility, where, it, is, filtered, and, cleaned, and, returned, to, the, water, cycle, at, this, time, resomation, is, permitted, for, commercial, use, in, areas, throughout, the, u, s, however, several, other, countries, including, the, uk, are, considering, using, this, technology, within, their, medical, schools, and, universities, mushroom, burial, has, been, developed, by, jae, rhim, lee, and, her, colleagues, to, address, the, impact, traditional, burial, approaches, have, on, the, environment, it, is, an, eco, friendly, process, which, consists, of, dressing, the, cadaver, in, a, bodysuit, with, mushroom, spores, woven, into, it, nicknamed, the, infinity, burial, suit, rhim, developed, her, own, mushrooms, by, feeding, them, her, hair, skin, and, nails, to, create, a, mushroom, variety, that, will, best, decompose, human, remains, as, the, mushrooms, grow, they, consume, the, remains, within, the, suit, as, well, as, the, toxins, that, are, being, released, by, the, body, rhim, and, her, colleagues, created, this, suit, as, a, symbol, of, a, new, way, for, people, to, think, about, the, relationship, between, their, body, after, death, and, the, environment, another, method, of, natural, burial, is, being, developed, to, plant, the, human, body, in, fetal, position, inside, an, egg, shaped, pod, the, pod, containing, the, body, will, form, a, biodegradable, capsule, that, will, not, harm, the, surrounding, earth, the, biodegradable, capsule, doubles, as, a, seed, which, can, be, customized, to, grow, into, either, a, birch, maple, or, eucalyptus, tree, the, goal, of, this, method, is, to, create, parks, full, of, trees, that, loved, ones, can, walk, through, and, mourn, as, opposed, to, a, graveyard, full, of, tombstones, this, method, aims, to, return, the, body, to, the, earth, in, the, most, environmentally, friendly, way, possible, the, tree, pod, method, originated, in, the, uk, but, is, now, becoming, a, more, popular, method, of, burial, the, definition, of, natural, burial, grounds, suggests, that, people, are, being, buried, without, any, kind, of, formaldehyde, based, embalming, fluid, or, synthetic, ingredients, and, that, the, bodies, that, are, being, returned, to, the, earth, will, also, be, returning, nutrients, to, the, environment, in, a, way, that, is, less, expensive, than, other, available, burial, methods, not, only, are, tree, pods, a, more, cost, effective, and, environmentally, friendly, way, to, memorialize, loved, ones, this, method, also, offers, emotional, support, the, memories, of, loved, ones, will, be, immortalized, through, the, concept, of, a, deceased, person, having, a, medium, trees, that, will, continue, to, live, and, grow, embalming, is, the, practice, of, preserving, a, body, against, decay, and, is, used, in, many, cultures, mummification, is, a, more, extensive, method, of, embalming, further, delaying, the, decay, process, bodies, are, often, buried, wrapped, in, a, shroud, or, placed, in, a, coffin, or, in, some, cases, a, casket, a, larger, container, may, be, used, such, as, a, ship, in, the, u, s, coffins, are, usually, covered, by, a, grave, liner, or, a, burial, vault, which, prevents, the, coffin, from, collapsing, under, the, weight, of, the, earth, or, floating, away, during, a, flood, these, containers, slow, the, decomposition, process, by, partially, physically, blocking, decomposing, bacteria, and, other, organisms, from, accessing, the, corpse, an, additional, benefit, of, using, containers, to, hold, the, body, is, that, if, the, soil, covering, the, corpse, is, washed, away, by, a, flood, or, some, other, natural, process, then, the, corpse, will, still, not, be, exposed, to, open, air, the, body, may, be, dressed, in, fancy, and, or, ceremonial, clothes, personal, objects, of, the, deceased, such, as, a, favorite, piece, of, jewelry, or, photograph, may, be, included, with, the, body, this, practice, also, known, as, the, inclusion, of, grave, goods, serves, several, purposes, burials, may, be, placed, in, a, number, of, different, positions, bodies, with, the, arms, crossed, date, back, to, ancient, cultures, such, as, chaldea, in, the, 10th, century, bc, where, the, x, symbolized, their, sky, god, later, ancient, egyptian, gods, and, royalty, from, approximately, 3500, b, c, are, shown, with, crossed, arms, such, as, the, god, osiris, the, lord, of, the, dead, or, mummified, royalty, with, crossed, arms, in, high, and, low, body, positions, depending, upon, the, dynasty, the, burial, of, bodies, in, the, extended, position, i, e, lying, flat, with, arms, and, legs, straight, or, with, the, arms, folded, upon, the, chest, and, with, the, eyes, and, mouth, closed, extended, burials, may, be, supine, lying, on, the, back, or, prone, lying, on, the, front, however, in, some, cultures, being, buried, face, down, shows, marked, disrespect, like, in, the, case, of, the, sioux, other, ritual, practices, place, the, body, in, a, flexed, position, with, the, legs, bent, or, crouched, with, the, legs, folded, up, to, the, chest, warriors, in, some, ancient, societies, were, buried, in, an, upright, position, in, islam, the, body, is, placed, in, supine, position, hands, along, the, sides, and, the, head, is, turned, to, its, right, with, the, face, towards, the, qibla, many, cultures, treat, placement, of, dead, people, in, an, appropriate, position, to, be, a, sign, of, respect, even, when, burial, is, impossible, in, nonstandard, burial, practices, such, as, mass, burial, the, body, may, be, positioned, arbitrarily, this, can, be, a, sign, of, disrespect, to, the, deceased, or, at, least, nonchalance, on, the, part, of, the, inhumer, or, due, to, considerations, of, time, and, space, most, often, a, burial, will, be, oriented, to, a, specific, direction, for, religious, purposes, as, are, the, case, for, persons, of, the, abrahamic, faiths, standard, jewish, burials, are, made, supine, east, west, with, the, head, at, the, western, end, of, the, grave, in, order, to, face, jerusalem, in, other, cases, the, body, may, be, buried, on, a, north, south, axis, or, simply, facing, towards, the, exit, of, the, cemetery, or, burial, grounds, this, is, done, in, order, to, facilitate, the, return, to, israel, foretold, of, all, those, who, are, resurrected, at, the, end, of, time, following, the, coming, of, the, messiah, historically, christian, burials, followed, similar, principles, where, the, body, was, placed, east, west, to, mirror, the, layout, of, christian, churches, which, were, themselves, oriented, as, such, for, much, the, same, reason, to, view, the, coming, of, christ, on, judgment, day, eschaton, in, many, christian, traditions, ordained, clergy, are, traditionally, buried, in, the, opposite, orientation, and, their, coffins, carried, likewise, so, that, at, the, general, resurrection, they, may, rise, facing, and, ready, to, minister, to, their, people, in, an, islamic, funeral, the, grave, should, be, aligned, perpendicular, to, the, qibla, the, direction, to, the, kaaba, in, mecca, with, the, face, turned, to, the, right, along, the, qibla, for, humans, maintaining, an, upside, down, position, with, the, head, vertically, below, the, feet, is, highly, uncomfortable, for, any, extended, period, of, time, and, consequently, burial, in, that, attitude, as, opposed, to, attitudes, of, rest, or, watchfulness, as, above, is, highly, unusual, and, generally, symbolic, occasionally, suicides, and, assassins, were, buried, upside, down, as, a, post, mortem, punishment, and, as, with, burial, at, cross, roads, to, inhibit, the, activities, of, the, resulting, undead, in, gulliver, s, travels, the, lilliputians, buried, their, dead, upside, down, they, bury, their, dead, with, their, heads, directly, downward, because, they, hold, an, opinion, that, in, eleven, thousand, moons, they, are, all, to, rise, again, in, which, period, the, earth, which, they, conceive, to, be, flat, will, turn, upside, down, and, by, this, means, they, shall, at, their, resurrection, be, found, ready, standing, on, their, feet, the, learn, d, among, them, confess, the, absurdity, of, this, doctrine, but, the, practice, still, continues, in, compliance, to, the, vulgar, swift, s, notion, of, inverted, burial, might, seem, the, highest, flight, of, fancy, but, it, appears, that, among, english, millenarians, the, idea, that, the, world, would, be, turned, upside, down, at, the, apocalypse, enjoyed, some, currency, there, is, at, least, one, attested, case, of, a, person, being, buried, upside, down, by, instruction, a, major, peter, labilliere, of, dorking, d, 4, june, 1800, lies, thus, upon, the, summit, of, box, hill, similar, stories, have, attached, themselves, to, other, noted, eccentrics, particularly, in, southern, england, but, not, always, with, a, foundation, in, truth, south, korea, s, funeral, arrangements, have, drastically, changed, in, the, course, of, only, two, decades, according, to, chang, won, park, park, states, that, around, the, 1980s, at, home, funeral, ceremonies, were, the, general, norm, straying, away, from, anywhere, that, was, not, a, family, home, dying, close, to, home, with, friends, and, family, was, considered, a, good, death, while, dying, away, from, home, was, considered, a, bad, death, this, gradually, changed, as, the, upper, and, middle, class, started, holding, funerals, in, the, mortuaries, of, hospitals, this, posed, an, issue, for, hospitals, because, of, the, rapid, increase, in, funerals, being, held, and, maxing, occupancy, this, resolved, when, a, law, was, passed, to, allow, the, civilian, population, to, hold, funerals, in, the, mortuaries, of, hospitals, the, lower, class, then, followed, suit, copying, the, newly, set, traditions, of, the, upper, classes, with, this, change, the, practice, of, cremation, became, viewed, more, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, burials, cremation, was, first, introduced, by, buddhism, but, was, banned, in, 1470, it, was, not, until, the, japanese, colonization, period, that, cremation, was, reintroduced, in, 1945, and, later, lifted, the, ban, it, took, until, 1998, for, cremation, to, rapidly, grow, in, popularity, a, ted, talk, by, kelli, swazey, discusses, how, tana,

with, funeral, procedures, and, the, location, of, gravesites, of, family, and, friends, specific, slaves, were, assigned, to, prepare, dead, bodies, build, coffins, dig, graves, and, construct, headstones, slave, funerals, were, typically, at, night, when, the, workday, was, over, with, the, master, present, to, view, all, the, ceremonial, procedures, slaves, from, nearby, plantations, were, regularly, in, attendance, at, death, a, slave, s, body, was, wrapped, in, cloth, the, hands, were, placed, across, the, chest, and, a, metal, plate, was, placed, on, top, of, their, hands, the, reasoning, for, the, plate, was, to, hinder, their, return, home, by, suppressing, any, spirits, in, the, coffin, often, personal, property, was, buried, with, slaves, to, appease, spirits, the,

to, be, used, for, those, who, have, reached, 15, years, of, age, apart, from, sanitary, and, other, practical, considerations, the, site, of, burial, can, be, determined, by, religious, and, socio, cultural, considerations, thus, in, some, traditions, especially, with, an, animistic, logic, the, remains, of, the, dead, are, banished, for, fear, their, spirits, would, harm, the, living, if, too, close, others, keep, remains, close, to, help, surviving, generations, religious, rules, may, prescribe, a, specific, zone, e, g, some, christian, traditions, hold, that, christians, must, be, buried, in, consecrated, ground, usually, a, cemetery, an, earlier, practice, burial, in, or, very, near, the, church, hence, the, word, churchyard, was, generally, abandoned, with, individual, exceptions, as, a, high, posthumous, honour, also, many, existing, funeral, monuments, and, crypts, remain, in, use, royalty, and, high, nobility, often, have, one, or, more, traditional, sites, of, burial, generally, monumental, often, in, a, palatial, chapel, or, cathedral, in, north, america, private, family, cemeteries, were, common, among, wealthy, landowners, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, many, prominent, people, were, buried, in, private, cemeteries, on, their, respective, properties, sometimes, in, lead, lined, coffins, many, of, these, family, cemeteries, were, not, documented, and, were, therefore, lost, to, time, and, abandoned, their, grave, markers, having, long, since, been, pilfered, by, vandals, or, covered, by, forest, growth, their, locations, are, occasionally, discovered, during, construction, projects, most, modern, cultures, mark, the, location, of, the, body, with, a, headstone, this, serves, two, purposes, first, the, grave, will, not, accidentally, be, exhumed, second, headstones, often, contain, information, or, tributes, to, deceased, this, is, a, form, of, remembrance, for, loved, ones, it, can, also, be, viewed, as, a, form, of, immortality, especially, in, cases, of, famous, people, s, graves, such, monumental, inscriptions, may, subsequently, be, useful, to, genealogists, and, family, historians, in, many, cultures, graves, will, be, grouped, so, the, monuments, make, up, a, necropolis, a, city, of, the, dead, paralleling, the, community, of, the, living, in, many, cultures, graves, are, marked, with, durable, markers, or, monuments, intended, to, help, remind, people, of, the, buried, person, an, unmarked, grave, is, a, grave, with, no, such, memorial, marker, another, sort, of, unmarked, grave, is, a, burial, site, with, an, anonymous, marker, such, as, a, simple, cross, boots, rifle, and, helmet, a, sword, and, shield, a, cairn, of, stones, or, even, a, monument, this, may, occur, when, identification, of, the, deceased, is, impossible, although, many, unidentified, deceased, are, buried, in, potter, s, fields, some, are, memorialized, especially, in, smaller, communities, or, in, the, case, of, deaths, publicized, by, local, media, anonymous, burials, also, happen, in, poorer, or, disadvantaged, populations, communities, in, countries, such, as, south, africa, where, in, the, past, the, non, white, population, was, simply, too, poor, to, afford, headstones, at, the, cemetery, in, the, small, rural, town, of, harding, kwazulu, natal, many, grave, sites, have, no, identification, and, just, have, a, border, of, stones, which, mark, out, the, dimensions, of, the, grave, site, itself, many, countries, have, buried, an, unidentified, soldier, or, other, member, of, the, military, in, a, prominent, location, as, a, form, of, respect, for, all, unidentified, war, dead, the, uk, memorializes, the, unknown, warrior, in, westminster, abbey, france, s, is, buried,

found, that, depending, on, the, location, within, germany, from, 0, to, 43, of, burials, were, anonymous, according, to, christian, century, magazine, the, perspective, of, the, roman, catholic, church, is, that, anonymous, burials, reflect, a, dwindling, belief, in, god, others, claim, that, this, trend, is, mainly, driven, by, secularism, and, the, high, costs, of, traditional, burials, in, rare, cases, a, known, person, may, be, buried, without, identification, perhaps, to, avoid, desecration, of, the, corpse, grave, robbing, or, vandalism, of, the, burial, site, this, may, be, particularly, the, case, with, infamous, or, notorious, figures, in, other, cases, it, may, be, to, prevent, the, grave, from, becoming, a, tourist, attraction, or, a, destination, of, pilgrimage, survivors, may, cause, the, deceased, to, be, buried, in, a, secret, location, or, other, unpublished, place, or, in, a, grave, with, a, false, name, or, no, name, at, all, on, the, marker, following,

humphrey, bogart, mary, pickford, and, michael, jackson, are, secluded, in, private, gated, gardens, or, mausoleums, with, no, public, access, a, number, of, tombs, are, also, kept, from, the, public,

famous, people, are, buried, some, couples, or, groups, of, people, such, as, a, married, couple, or, other, family, members, may, wish, to, be, buried, in, the, same, plot, in, some, cases, the, coffins, or, urns, may, simply, be, buried, side, by, side, in, others, one, casket, may, be, interred, above, another, if, this, is, planned, for, in, advance, the, first, casket, may, be, buried, more, deeply, than, is, the, usual, practice, so, that, the, second, casket, may, be, placed, over, it, without, disturbing, the, first, in, many, states, in, australia, all, graves, are, designated,

separated, by, a, thin, layer, of, earth, as, such, all, graves, are, dug, to, greater, depth, for, the, initial, burial, than, the, traditional, six, feet, to, facilitate, this, practice, mass, burial, is, the, practice, of, burying, multiple, bodies, in, one, location, civilizations, attempting, genocide, often, employ, mass, burial, for, victims, however, mass, burial, may, in, many, cases, be, the, only, practical, means, of, dealing, with, an, overwhelming, number, of, human, remains, such, as, those, resulting, from, a, natural, disaster, an, act, of, terrorism, an, epidemic, or, an, accident, this, practice, has, become, less, common, in, the, developed, world, with, the, advent, of, genetic, testing, but, even, in, the, 21st, century, remains, which, are, unidentifiable, by, current, methods, may, be, buried, in, a, mass, grave, individuals, who, are, buried, at, the, expense, of, the, local, authorities, and, buried, in, potter, s, fields, may, be, buried, in, mass, graves, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, was, once, believed, to, have, been, buried, in, such, a, manner, but, today, it, is, known, that, such, burials, were, never, allowed, in, mozart, s, vienna, whose, magistrates, refused, to, agree, to, the, burial, regulations, decreed, by, joseph, ii, in, some, cases, the, remains, of, unidentified, individuals, have, been, buried, in, mass, graves, in, potter, s, fields, making, exhumation, and, future, identification, troublesome, for, law, enforcement, naval, ships, sunk, in, combat, are, also, considered, mass, graves, by, many, countries, for, example, u, s, navy, policy, declares, such, wrecks, a, mass, grave, such, as, the, uss, arizona, memorial, and, forbids, the, recovery, of, remains, in, lieu, of, recovery, divers, or, submersibles, may, leave, a, plaque, dedicated, to, the, memory, of, the, ship, or, boat, and, its, crew, and, family, members, are, invited, to, attend, the, ceremony, sites, of, large, former, battlefields, may, also, contain, one, or, more, mass, graves, douaumont, ossuary, is, one, such, mass, grave, and, it, contains, the, remains, of, 130, 000, soldiers, from, both, sides, of, the, battle, of, verdun, catacombs, also, constitute, a, form, of, mass, grave, some, catacombs, for, example, those, in, rome, were, designated, as, a, communal, burial, place, some, such, as, the, catacombs, of, paris, only, became, a, mass, grave, when, individual, burials, were, relocated, from, cemeteries, marked, for, demolition, judaism, does, not, generally, allow, multiple, bodies, in, a, grave, an, exception, to, this, is, a, grave, in, the, military, cemetery, in, jerusalem, where, there, is, a, kever, achim, hebrew, grave, of, brothers, where, two, soldiers, were, killed, together, in, a, tank, and, are, buried, in, one, grave, as, the, bodies, were, so, fused, together, with, the, metal, of, the, tank, that, they, could, not, be, separately, identified, they, were, buried, in, one, grave, along, with, parts, of, the, tank, sometimes, people, are, buried, alive, having, no, way, of, escaping, interment, they, die, in, place, typically, by, asphyxiation, dehydration, starvation, or, exposure, to, climate, people, may, come, to, be, buried, alive, in, a, number, of, different, ways, edgar, allan, poe, wrote, a, number, of, stories, and, poems, about, premature, burial, including, a, story, called, the, premature, burial, these, works, inspired, a, widespread, popular, fear, of, this, appalling, but, unlikely, event, various, expedients, have, been, devised, to, prevent, it, including, burying, telephones, or, sensors, in, graves, historically, burial, at, cross, roads, was, the, method, of, disposing, of, executed, criminals, and, suicides, in, great, britain, this, tradition, was, altered, by, the, burial, of, suicide, act, 1823, which, abolished, the, legal, requirements, of, burying, suicides, and, other, people, at, crossroads, cross, roads, form, a, crude, cross, shape, and, this, may, have, given, rise, to, the, belief, that, these, spots, were, selected, as, the, next, best, burying, places, to, consecrated, ground, another, possible, explanation, is, that, the, ancient, teutonic, germanic, ethnic, groups, often, built, their, altars, at, the, cross, roads, and, since, human, sacrifices, especially, of, criminals, formed, part, of, the, ritual, these, spots, came, to, be, regarded, as, execution, grounds, hence, after, the, introduction, of, christianity, criminals, and, suicides, were, buried, at, the, cross, roads, during, the, night, to, assimilate, as, far, as, possible, their, funeral, to, that, of, the, pagans, an, example, of, a, cross, road, execution, ground, was, the, famous, tyburn, in, london, which, stood, on, the, spot, where, the, roman, road, to, edgware, and, beyond, met, the, roman, road, heading, west, out, of, london, superstition, also, played, a, part, in, the, selection, of, crossroads, in, the, burial, of, suicides, folk, belief, often, held, such, individuals, could, rise, as, some, form, of, undead, such, as, a, vampire, and, burying, them, at, crossroads, would, inhibit, their, ability, to, find, and, wreak, havoc, on, their, living, relations, and, former, associates, in, addition, to, burying, human, remains, many, human, cultures, also, regularly, bury, animal, remains, pets, and, other, animals, of, emotional, significance, are, often, ceremonially, buried, most, families, bury, deceased, pets, on, their, own, properties, mainly, in, a, yard, with, a, shoe, box, or, any, other, type, of, container, served, as, a, coffin, the, ancient, egyptians, are, known, to, have, mummified, and, buried, cats, which, they, considered, deities, humans, are, not, always, the, only, species, to, bury, their, dead, chimpanzees, and, elephants, are, known, to, throw, leaves, and, branches, over, fallen, members, of, their, family, groups, in, a, particularly, odd, case, an, elephant, which, trampled, a, human, mother, and, child, buried, its, victims, under, a, pile, of, leaves, before, disappearing, into, the, bushes, in, 2013, a, viral, video, caught, a, dog, burying, a, dead, puppy, by, pushing, sand, with, its, own, nose, it, is, presumed, however, that, since, dogs, retain, the, instinct, to, bury, food, this, is, what, is, being, depicted, in, the, video, in, social, insects, ants, and, termites, also, bury, their, dead, nestmates, depending, on, the, properties, of, the, corpse, and, the, social, context, laboratory, rats, had, been, observed, using, bedding, material, to, bury, dead, conspecifics, placed, in, their, test, chamber, exhumation, or, disinterment, is, the, act, of, digging, something, up, especially, a, corpse, this, is, most, often, done, to, relocate, a, body, to, a, different, burial, spot, families, may, make, this, decision, to, locate, the, deceased, in, a, more, pertinent, or, convenient, place, in, shared, family, burial, sites, e, g, a, married, couple, if, the, previously, deceased, person, has, been, buried, for, an, insufficient, period, of, time, the, second, body, may, be, buried, elsewhere, until, it, is, safe, to, relocate, it, to, the, shared, grave, exhumation, of, human, remains, occur, for, a, number, of, other, reasons, including, body, identification, or, as, part, of, a, criminal, investigation, if, an, individual, dies, in, suspicious, circumstances, police, may, request, exhumation, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, exhumations, may, also, occur, via, grave, robbery, or, as, an, act, of, desecration, in, rare, historical, cases, e, g, pope, formosus, or, oliver, cromwell, a, body, may, be, exhumed, for, posthumous, execution, dissection, or, gibbeting, notable, individuals, may, be, exhumed, to, answer, historical, questions, exhumation, by, archaeologists, enables, the, study, of, remains, as, with, many, ancient, egyptian, mummies, that, have, been, put, on, public, display, in, most, jurisdictions, a, legal, exhumation, usually, requires, a, court, order, or, permission, by, the, next, of, kin, of, the, deceased, u, s, law, allows, disinterment, only, for, the, most, compelling, of, reasons, and, with, the, permission, of, close, relatives, and, the, cemetery, official, also, in, many, countries, permits, are, required, by, some, governing, agency, to, legally, conduct, a, disinterment, in, folklore, and, mythology, exhumation, has, also, been, frequently, associated, with, the, performance, of, rites, to, banish, undead, manifestations, a, historical, example, is, the, 1892, mercy, brown, vampire, incident, of, rhode, island, remains, may, be, exhumed, for, reinterment, at, a, more, appropriate, location, for, various, reasons, frequently, cultures, have, different, sets, of, exhumation, taboos, occasionally, these, differences, result, in, conflict, especially, in, cases, where, a, culture, with, more, lenient, exhumation, rules, wishes, to, operate, on, the, territory, of, a, different, culture, for, example, u, s, construction, companies, have, run, into, conflict, with, native, american, groups, that, have, wanted, to, preserve, their, burial, grounds, from, disturbance, in, southern, chinese, culture, graves, are, opened, after, a, period, of, years, the, bones, are, removed, cleaned, dried, and, placed, in, a, ceramic, pot, for, reburial, in, taiwan, or, in, a, smaller, coffin, and, to, be, reburied, in, another, location, in, vietnam, the, practice, is, called, ji, ng, in, taiwan, or, b, c, m, in, vietnam, digging, up, bones, and, is, an, important, ritual, in, the, posthumous, care, of, children, for, their, deceased, parents, and, ancestors, jewish, law, forbids, the, exhumation, of, a, corpse, the, majority, of, muslim, jurors, maintain, that, an, individual, buried, in, a, mosque, must, be, exhumed, and, that, offering, prayers, in, such, a, mosque, renders, the, prayer, invalid, jurists, however, hold, that, mosques, built, around, already, existing, graves, are, to, be, demolished, in, england, and, wales, once, the, top, of, a, coffin, has, been, lowered, below, ground, level, in, a, burial, if, it, is, raised, again, say, for, example, the, grave, sides, are, protruding, and, need, further, work, this, is, considered, an, exhumation, and, the, home, office, are, required, to, be, notified, and, a, full, investigation, undertaken, therefore, grave, diggers, in, england, and, wales, are, particularly, careful, to, ensure, that, grave, sites, are, dug, with, plenty, of, room, for, the, coffin, to, pass, reinterment, refers, to, the, reburial, of, a, corpse, secondary, burial, is, a, burial, cremation, or, inhumation, that, is, dug, into, a, pre, existing, barrow, or, grave, any, time, after, its, initial, construction, it, is, often, associated, with, the, belief, that, there, is, a, liminal, phase, between, the, time, that, a, person, dies, and, finally, decays, alternatives, to, burial, variously, show, respect, for, the, dead, accelerate, decomposition, and, disposal, or, prolong, display, of, the, remains, as, the, human, population, progresses, cultures, and, traditions, change, with, it, evolution, is, generally, slow, sometimes, more, rapid, south, korea, s, funeral, arrangements, have, drastically, changed, in, the, course, of, only, two, decades, according, to, chang, won, park, around, the, 1980s, at, home, funeral, ceremonies, were, the, general, norm, straying, away, from, anywhere, that, was, not, a, family, home, dying, close, to, home, with, friends, and, family, was, considered, a, good, death, while, dying, away, from, home, was, considered, a, bad, death, this, gradually, changed, as, the, upper, and, middle, class, started, holding, funerals, in, the, mortuaries, of, hospitals, this, posed, an, issue, for, hospitals, because, of, the, rapid, increase, in, funerals, being, held, and, maxing, occupancy, this, quickly, resolved, when, a, law, was, passed, to, allow, the, civilian, population, holding, funerals, in, the, mortuaries, of, hospitals, the, lower, class, quickly, followed, suit, copying, the, newly, set, traditions, of, the, upper, classes, with, this, change, cremation, also, practice, more, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, burials, cremation, was, first, introduced, by, buddhism, and, was, quickly, banned, in, 1470, it, was, not, until, the, japanese, colonization, period, that, cremation, was, reintroduced, in, 1945, and, later, on, lifted, the, ban, it, took, until, 1998, for, cremation, to, rapidly, grow, in, popularity, according, to, margaret, holloway, funerals, are, believed, to, be, driven, by, the, consumer, s, choice, personalisation, secularization, and, stories, that, place, individual, traditional, meta, narratives, it, has, been, studied, that, funeral, homes, in, the, uk, are, most, concerned, with, comforting, the, grieving, rather, than, focusing, on, the, departed, this, study, found, that, modern, day, funerals, focus, on, the, psycho, social, spiritual, event, modern, day, funerals, also, help, the, transition, of, the, recently, passed, transitioning, to, the, social, status, of, the, deceased, the, article, found, that, funeral, homes, do, not, adhere, to, traditional, religious, beliefs, but, do, follow, religious, traditions
