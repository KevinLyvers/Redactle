members, of, the, world, council, of, churches, to, the, hierarchs, who, would, lead, the, oriental, orthodox, the, latter, phrase, was, tantamount, to, accepting, nestorianism, which, expressed, itself, in, a, terminology, incompatible, with, their, understanding, of, christology, nestorianism, was, understood, as, seeing, christ, in, two, separate, natures, human, and, divine, each, with, different, actions, and, experiences, in, contrast, cyril, of, alexandria, advocated, the, formula, one, nature, of, god, the, incarnate, logos, or, as, others, translate, one, incarnate, nature, of, the, word, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, were, therefore, often, called, monophysite, although, they, reject, this, label, as, it, is, associated, with, eutychian, monophysitism, they, prefer, the, term, miaphysite, in, the, years, following, chalcedon, the, patriarchs, of, constantinople, intermittently, remained, in, communion, with, the, non, chalcedonian, patriarchs, of, alexandria, and, antioch, see, henotikon, while, rome, remained, out, of, communion, with, the, latter, and, in, unstable, communion, with, constantinople, it, was, not, until, 518, that, the, new, byzantine,

seen, with, the, same, importance, and, from, several, meetings, between, the, authorities, of, the, holy, see, and, the, oriental, orthodoxy, reconciling, declarations, emerged, in, the, common, statement, of, syriac, patriarch, mar, ignatius, zakka, i, iwas, and, the, roman, pope, john, paul, ii, in, 1984, the, confusions, and, schisms, that, occurred, between, their, churches, in, the, later, centuries, they, realize, today, in, no, way, affect, or, touch, the, substance, of, their, faith, since, these, arose, only, because, of, differences, in, terminology, and, culture, and, in, the, various, formulae, adopted, by, different, theological, schools, to, express, the, same, matter, accordingly, we, find, today, no, real, basis, for, the, sad, divisions, and, schisms, that, subsequently, arose, between, us, concerning, the, doctrine, of, incarnation, in, words, and, life, we, confess, the, true, doctrine, concerning, christ, our, lord, notwithstanding, the, differences,

number, of, faithful, living, in, the, middle, east, which, along, with, other, eastern, christian, communions, represent, an, autochthonous, christian, presence, whose, origins, date, further, back, than, the, birth, and, spread, of, islam, in, the, middle, east, as, of, 2011, it, was, the, dominant, religion, in, armenia, 94, and, ethnically, armenian, unrecognized, nagorno, karabakh, republic,

churches, among, eastern, and, oriental, churches, exceeded, in, number, only, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, also, of, particular, importance, are, the, armenian, patriarchate, of, constantinople, in, turkey, and, the, armenian, apostolic, church, of, iran, these, oriental, orthodox, churches, represent, the, largest, christian, minority, in, both, of, these, predominantly, muslim, countries, turkey, and, iran, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, are, distinguished, by, their, recognition, of, only, the, first, three, ecumenical, councils, during, the, period, of, the, state, church, of, the, roman, empire, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, the, first, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, and, the, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, oriental, orthodoxy, shares, much, theology, and, many, ecclesiastical, traditions, with, the, eastern, orthodox, church, these, include, a, similar, doctrine, of, salvation, and, a, tradition, of, collegiality, between, bishops, as, well, as, reverence, of, the, theotokos, and, use, of, the, nicene, creed, the, primary, theological, difference, between, the, two, communions, is, the, differing, christology, oriental, orthodoxy, rejects, the, chalcedonian, definition, and, instead, adopts, the, miaphysite, formula, believing, that, the, human, and, divine, natures, of, christ, are, united, historically, the, early, prelates, of, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, thought, that, the, chalcedonian, definition, implied, a, possible, repudiation, of, the, trinity, or, a, concession, to, nestorianism, the, break, in, communion, between, the, imperial, roman, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, did, not, occur, suddenly, but, rather, gradually, over, two, to, three, centuries, following, the, council, of, chalcedon, eventually, the, two, communions, developed, separate, institutions, and, the, oriental, orthodox, did, not, participate, in, any, of, the, later, ecumenical, councils, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, maintain, ancient, apostolic, succession, and, the, historic, episcopacy, the, various, churches, are, governed, by, holy, synods, with, a, primus, inter, pares, bishop, serving, as, primate, the, primates, hold, titles, such, as, patriarch, catholicos, and, pope, the, alexandrian, patriarchate, the, antiochian, patriarchate, along, with, patriarchate, of, rome, was, one, of, the, most, prominent, sees, of, the, early, christian, church, oriental, orthodoxy, does, not, have, a, magisterial, leader, like, the, roman, catholic, church, nor, does, the, communion, have, a, leader, who, can, convene, ecumenical, synods, like, the, eastern, orthodox, church, meanwhile, its, ecumenical, dialogues, and, internal, church, relations, are, led, by, the, standing, conference, of, oriental, orthodox, churches, which, acts, as, the, permanent, representative, council, of, its, member, churches, the, schism, between, oriental, orthodoxy, and, the, adherents, of, chalcedonian, christianity, was, based, on, differences, in, christology, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, declared, that, jesus, christ, is, god, that, is, to, say, consubstantial, with, the, father, later, the, third, ecumenical, council, the, council, of, ephesus, declared, that, jesus, christ, though, divine, as, well, as, human, is, only, one, being, or, person, hypostasis, thus, the, council, of, ephesus, explicitly, rejected, nestorianism, the, christological, doctrine, that, christ, was, two, distinct, persons, one, divine, the, logos, and, one, human, jesus, who, happened, to, inhabit, the, same, body, twenty, years, after, ephesus, the, council, of, chalcedon, reaffirmed, the, view, that, jesus, christ, was, a, single, person, but, at, the, same, time, declared, that, this, one, person, existed, in, two, complete, natures, one, human, and, one, divine, at, times, chalcedonian, christians, have, referred, to, the, oriental, orthodox, as, being, monophysites, that, is, to, say, accusing, them, of, following, the, teachings, of, eutyches, c, 380, c, 456, who, argued, that, jesus, christ, was, not, human, at, all, but, only, divine, monophysitism, was, condemned, as, heretical, alongside, nestorianism, and, to, accuse, a, church, of, being, monophysite, is, to, accuse, it, of, falling, into, the, opposite, extreme, from, nestorianism, however, the, oriental, orthodox, themselves, reject, this, description, as, inaccurate, having, officially, condemned, the, teachings, of, both, nestorius, and, eutyches, they, define, themselves, as, miaphysite, instead, holding, that, christ, has, one, nature, but, this, nature, is, both, human, and, divine, oriental, orthodox, christians, such, as, copts, syrians, and, indians, use, a, breviary, such, as, the, agpeya, and, shehimo, respectively, to, pray, the, canonical, hours, seven, times, a, day, while, facing, in, the, eastward, direction, towards, jerusalem, in, anticipation, of, the, second, coming, of, jesus, this, christian, practice, has, its, roots, in, psalm, 119, 164, in, which, the, prophet, david, prays, to, god, seven, times, a, day, before, praying, they, wash, their, hands, and, face, in, order, to, be, clean, before, and, to, present, their, best, to, god, shoes, are, removed, in, order, to, acknowledge, that, one, is, offering, prayer, before, a, holy, god, in, this, christian, tradition, it, is, customary, for, women, to, wear, a, christian, headcovering, when, praying, some, oriental, orthodox, churches, such, as, the, coptic, orthodox, ethiopian, orthodox, and, eritrean, orthodox, also, place, a, heavier, emphasis, on, old, testament, teachings, than, one, might, find, in, other, christian, denominations, and, its, followers, adhere, to, certain, practices, following, dietary, rules, that, are, similar, to, jewish, kashrut, require, that, their, male, members, undergo, circumcision, and, observes, ritual, purification, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, also, maintain, differing, compilations, of, the, biblical, canon, including, the, peshitta, coptic, and, orthodox, tewahedo, canons, and, the, armenian, canon, there, are, numerous, ongoing, internal, disputes, within, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, these, disputes, result, in, lesser, or, greater, degrees, of, impaired, communion, the, least, divisive, of, these, disputes, is, within, the, armenian, apostolic, church, between, the, catholicosate, of, etchmiadzin, and, the, catholicosate, of, the, great, house, of, cilicia, the, division, between, the, two, sees, intensified, during, the, soviet, period, the, holy, see, of, etchmiadzin, was, seen, as, a, captive, communist, puppet, by, some, western, bishops, and, clergy, sympathizers, of, this, established, congregations, independent, of, etchmiadzin, declaring, loyalty, instead, to, the, see, based, in, antelias, in, lebanon, the, division, was, formalized, in, 1956, when, the, antelias, cilician, see, broke, away, from, the, etchmiadzin, see, in, 1992, following, the, abdication, of, abune, merkorios, and, election, of, abune, paulos, some, ethiopian, orthodox, bishops, in, the, united, states, maintained, that, the, new, election, was, invalid, and, declared, their, independence, from, the, addis, ababa, administration, forming, separate, synod, on, 27, july, 2018, representatives, from, both, synods, reached, an, agreement, according, to, the, terms, of, the, agreement, abune, merkorios, was, reinstated, as, patriarch, alongside, abune, mathias, successor, of, abune, paulos, who, would, continue, to, be, responsible, for, administrative, duties, and, the, two, synods, were, merged, into, one, synod, with, any, excommunications, between, them, lifted, indians, who, follow, the, oriental, orthodox, faith, belong, to, the, malankara, orthodox, syrian, church, and, the, jacobite, syrian, christian, church, the, two, churches, were, united, before, 1912, and, after, 1958, but, again, separated, in, 1975, the, malankara, orthodox, syrian, church, also, known, as, the, indian, orthodox, church, is, an, autocephalous, church, it, is, headed, by, the, catholicos, of, the, east, and, malankara, metropolitan, the, jacobite, syrian, christian, church, is, an, autonomous, maphrianate, of, the, syriac, orthodox, church, in, india, the, malabar, independent, syrian, church, also, follows, the, oriental, orthodox, tradition, but, is, not, in, communion, with, other, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, is, sometimes, incorrectly, described, as, an, oriental, orthodox, church, though, its, origins, lie, in, disputes, that, predated, the, council, of, chalcedon, and, it, follows, a, different, christology, from, oriental, orthodoxy, the, historical, church, of, the, east, was, the, church, of, greater, iran, and, declared, itself, separate, from, the, state, church, of, the, roman, empire, in, 424, 27, years, before, the, ecumenical, councils, of, ephesus, and, chalcedon, theologically, the, church, of, the, east, was, affiliated, with, the, doctrine, of, nestorianism, and, thus, rejected, the, council, of, ephesus, which, declared, nestorianism, heretical, in, 431, the, christology, of, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, in, fact, developed, as, a, reaction, against, nestorian, christology, which, emphasizes, the, distinctness, of, the, human, and, divine, natures, of, christ
