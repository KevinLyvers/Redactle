catholicity, from, ancient, greek, romanized, katholik, s, lit, general, universal, via, latin, catholicus, is, a, concept, pertaining, to, beliefs, and, practices, that, are, widely, accepted, by, numerous, christian, denominations, most, notably, by, those, christian, denominations, that, describe, themselves, as, catholic, in, accordance, with, the, four, marks, of, the, church, as, expressed, in, the, nicene, creed, formulated, at, the, first, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, in, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, the, english, adjective, catholic, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, adjective, romanized, katholikos, meaning, general, universal, thus, catholic, means, that, in, the, church, the, wholeness, of, the, christian, faith, full, and, complete, all, embracing, and, with, nothing, lacking, is, proclaimed, to, all, people, without, excluding, any, part, of, the, faith, or, any, class, or, group, of, people, an, early, definition, for, what, is, catholic, was, summarized, in, what, is, known, as, the, vincentian, canon, in, the, 5th, century, commonitory, what, has, been, believed, everywhere, always, and, by, all, this, is, distinct, from, the, capitalized, word, catholic, referring, specifically, to, the, catholic, church, and, often, further, the, roman, catholic, church, used, especially, in, ecumenical, contexts, and, in, countries, where, other, churches, use, the, term, catholic, to, distinguish, it, from, broader, meanings, of, the, term, though, the, community, led, by, the, pope, in, rome, is, known, as, the, catholic, church, the, traits, of, catholicity, and, thus, the, term, catholic, are, also, ascribed, to, denominations, such, as, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, oriental, orthodox, church, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, it, also, occurs, in, the, language, of, churches, that, decisively, split, from, the, roman, catholic, church, like, lutheranism, and, anglicanism, as, well, as, independent, catholicism, old, catholicism, and, other, christian, denominations, while, traits, used, to, define, catholicity, as, well, as, recognition, of, these, traits, in, other, denominations, vary, among, these, groups, such, attributes, include, formal, sacraments, an, episcopal, polity, apostolic, succession, highly, structured, liturgical, worship, and, other, shared, ecclesiology, among, protestant, and, related, traditions, catholic, is, used, in, the, sense, of, indicating, a, self, understanding, of, the, universality, of, the, confession, and, continuity, of, faith, and, practice, from, early, christianity, encompassing, the, whole, company, of, god, s, redeemed, people, specifically, among, moravian, lutheran, anglican, methodist, and, reformed, denominations, the, term, catholic, is, used, in, claiming, to, be, heirs, of, the, apostolic, faith, these, denominations, consider, themselves, to, be, part, of, the, catholic, universal, church, teaching, that, the, term, designates, the, historic, orthodox, mainstream, of, christianity, whose, doctrine, was, defined, by, the, ecumenical, councils, and, creeds, and, as, such, most, reformers, appealed, to, this, catholic, tradition, and, believed, they, were, in, continuity, with, it, as, such, the, universality, or, catholicity, of, the, church, pertains, to, the, entire, body, or, assembly, of, believers, united, to, christ, a, common, belief, related, to, catholicity, is, institutional, continuity, with, the, early, christian, church, founded, by, jesus, christ, many, churches, or, communions, of, churches, identify, singularly, or, collectively, as, the, authentic, church, the, following, summarizes, the, major, schisms, and, conflicts, within, christianity, particularly, within, groups, that, identify, as, catholic, there, are, several, competing, historical, interpretations, as, to, which, groups, entered, into, schism, with, the, original, early, church, according, to, the, theory, of, pentarchy, the, early, undivided, church, came, to, be, organized, under, the, three, patriarchs, of, rome, alexandria, and, antioch, to, which, later, were, added, the, patriarchs, of, constantinople, and, jerusalem, the, bishop, of, rome, was, at, that, time, recognized, as, first, among, them, as, is, stated, for, instance, in, canon, 3, of, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, many, interpret, first, as, meaning, here, first, among, equals, and, doctrinal, or, procedural, disputes, were, often, referred, to, rome, as, when, on, appeal, by, athanasius, against, the, decision, of, the, council, of, tyre, 335, pope, julius, i, who, spoke, of, such, appeals, as, customary, annulled, the, action, of, that, council, and, restored, athanasius, and, marcellus, of, ancyra, to, their, sees, the, bishop, of, rome, was, also, considered, to, have, the, right, to, convene, ecumenical, councils, when, the, imperial, capital, moved, to, constantinople, rome, s, influence, was, sometimes, challenged, nonetheless, rome, claimed, special, authority, because, of, its, connection, to, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, who, many, believe, were, martyred, and, buried, in, rome, and, because, the, bishop, of, rome, saw, himself, as, the, successor, of, peter, there, are, sources, that, suggest, that, peter, was, not, the, first, pope, and, never, went, to, rome, the, 431, council, of, ephesus, the, third, ecumenical, council, was, chiefly, concerned, with, nestorianism, which, emphasized, the, distinction, between, the, humanity, and, divinity, of, jesus, and, taught, that, in, giving, birth, to, jesus, christ, the, virgin, mary, could, not, be, spoken, of, as, giving, birth, to, god, this, council, rejected, nestorianism, and, affirmed, that, as, humanity, and, divinity, are, inseparable, in, the, one, person, of, jesus, christ, his, mother, the, virgin, mary, is, thus, theotokos, god, bearer, mother, of, god, the, first, great, rupture, in, the, early, church, followed, this, council, those, who, refused, to, accept, the, council, s, ruling, were, largely, persian, and, are, represented, today, by, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, and, related, churches, which, however, do, not, now, hold, a, nestorian, theology, they, are, often, called, ancient, oriental, churches, the, next, major, break, was, after, the, council, of, chalcedon, 451, this, council, repudiated, eutychian, monophysitism, which, stated, that, the, divine, nature, completely, subsumed, the, human, nature, in, christ, this, council, declared, that, christ, though, one, person, exhibited, two, natures, without, confusion, without, change, without, division, without, separation, and, thus, is, both, fully, god, and, fully, human, the, alexandrian, church, rejected, the, terms, adopted, by, this, council, and, the, christian, churches, that, follow, the, tradition, of, non, acceptance, of, the, council, they, are, not, monophysite, in, doctrine, are, referred, to, as, pre, chalcedonian, or, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, next, great, rift, within, christianity, was, in, the, 11th, century, longstanding, doctrinal, disputes, as, well, as, conflicts, between, methods, of, church, government, and, the, evolution, of, separate, rites, and, practices, precipitated, a, split, in, 1054, that, divided, the, church, this, time, between, a, west, and, an, east, spain, england, france, the, holy, roman, empire, poland, bohemia, slovakia, scandinavia, the, baltic, states, and, western, europe, in, general, were, in, the, western, camp, and, greece, romania, russia, and, many, other, slavic, lands, anatolia, and, the, christians, in, syria, and, egypt, who, accepted, the, council, of, chalcedon, made, up, the, eastern, camp, this, division, between, the, western, church, and, the, eastern, church, is, called, the, east, west, schism, in, 1438, the, council, of, florence, convened, which, featured, a, strong, dialogue, focussed, on, understanding, the, theological, differences, between, the, east, and, west, with, the, hope, of, reuniting, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, several, eastern, churches, reunited, constituting, some, of, the, eastern, catholic, churches, another, major, division, in, the, church, occurred, in, the, 16th, century, with, the, protestant, reformation, after, which, many, parts, of, the, western, church, rejected, papal, authority, and, some, of, the, teachings, of, the, western, church, at, that, time, and, became, known, as, reformed, or, protestant, a, much, less, extensive, rupture, occurred, when, after, the, roman, catholic, church, s, first, vatican, council, in, which, it, officially, proclaimed, the, dogma, of, papal, infallibility, small, clusters, of, catholics, in, the, netherlands, and, in, german, speaking, countries, formed, the, old, catholic, altkatholische, church, use, of, the, terms, catholicity, and, catholicism, depends, on, context, for, times, preceding, the, great, schism, it, refers, to, the, nicene, creed, and, especially, to, tenets, of, christology, i, e, the, rejection, of, arianism, for, times, after, the, great, schism, catholicism, with, the, capital, c, in, the, sense, of, the, catholic, church, combines, the, latin, church, the, eastern, catholic, churches, of, greek, tradition, and, the, other, eastern, catholic, churches, liturgical, and, canonical, practices, vary, between, all, these, particular, churches, constituting, the, roman, and, eastern, catholic, churches, or, as, richard, mcbrien, calls, them, the, communion, of, catholic, churches, contrast, this, with, the, term, catholicos, but, not, catholicism, in, reference, to, the, head, of, a, particular, church, in, eastern, christianity, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, term, catholic, is, understood, as, to, cover, those, who, are, baptized, and, in, communion, with, the, pope, other, christians, use, it, in, an, intermediate, sense, neither, just, those, christians, in, communion, with, rome, but, more, narrow, than, all, christians, who, recite, the, creeds, they, use, it, to, distinguish, their, position, from, a, calvinistic, or, puritan, form, of, protestantism, it, is, then, meaningful, to, attempt, to, draw, up, a, list, of, common, characteristic, beliefs, and, practices, of, this, definition, of, catholicity, churches, in, the, roman, catholic, tradition, administer, seven, sacraments, or, sacred, mysteries, baptism, confirmation, or, chrismation, eucharist, penance, also, known, as, reconciliation, anointing, of, the, sick, holy, orders, and, matrimony, for, protestant, christians, only, baptism, and, eucharist, are, considered, sacraments, in, churches, that, consider, themselves, catholic, a, sacrament, is, considered, to, be, an, efficacious, visible, sign, of, god, s, invisible, grace, while, the, word, mystery, is, used, not, only, of, these, rites, but, also, with, other, meanings, with, reference, to, revelations, of, and, about, god, and, to, god, s, mystical, interaction, with, creation, the, word, sacrament, latin, a, solemn, pledge, the, usual, term, in, the, west, refers, specifically, to, these, rites, many, individual, christians, and, christian, denominations, consider, themselves, catholic, on, the, basis, in, particular, of, apostolic, succession, they, may, be, described, as, falling, into, five, groups, for, some, confessions, listed, under, category, 3, the, self, affirmation, refers, to, the, belief, in, the, ultimate, unity, of, the, universal, church, under, one, god, and, one, savior, rather, than, in, one, visibly, unified, institution, as, with, category, 1, above, in, this, usage, catholic, is, sometimes, written, with, a, lower, case, c, the, western, apostles, creed, and, the, nicene, creed, stating, i, believe, in, one, holy, catholic, church, are, recited, in, worship, services, among, some, denominations, in, category, 3, christian, is, substituted, for, catholic, in, order, to, denote, the, doctrine, that, the, christian, church, is, at, least, ideally, undivided, protestant, churches, each, have, their, own, distinctive, theological, and, ecclesiological, notions, of, catholicity, in, its, letter, on, some, aspects, of, the, church, understood, as, communion, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, stressed, the, belief, that, the, idea, of, the, universal, church, as, a, communion, of, churches, must, not, be, presented, as, meaning, that, every, particular, church, is, a, subject, complete, in, itself, and, that, the, universal, church, is, the, result, of, a, reciprocal, recognition, on, the, part, of, the, particular, churches, it, insisted, that, the, universal, church, cannot, be, conceived, as, the, sum, of, the, particular, churches, or, as, a, federation, of, particular, churches, the, catholic, church, considers, only, those, in, full, communion, with, the, holy, see, in, rome, as, catholics, while, recognising, the, valid, episcopates, and, eucharist, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, in, most, cases, it, does, not, consider, protestant, denominations, such, as, lutheran, ones, to, be, genuine, churches, and, so, uses, the, term, ecclesial, communities, to, refer, to, them, because, the, catholic, church, does, not, consider, these, denominations, to, have, valid, episcopal, orders, capable, of, celebrating, a, valid, eucharist, it, does, not, classify, them, as, churches, in, the, proper, sense, the, catholic, church, s, doctrine, of, infallibility, derives, from, the, belief, that, the, authority, jesus, gave, peter, as, head, of, the, church, on, earth, has, been, passed, on, to, his, successors, the, popes, relevant, bible, verses, include, and, i, tell, you, that, you, are, peter, and, on, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, and, the, gates, of, hades, will, not, overcome, it, i, will, give, you, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, whatever, you, bind, on, earth, will, be, bound, in, heaven, and, whatever, you, loose, on, earth, will, be, loosed, in, heaven, the, latin, and, eastern, catholic, churches, together, form, the, catholic, church, often, called, the, roman, catholic, church, the, world, s, largest, single, religious, body, and, the, largest, christian, denomination, as, well, as, its, largest, catholic, church, comprising, over, half, of, all, christians, 1, 27, billion, christians, of, 2, 1, billion, and, nearly, one, sixth, of, the, world, s, population, richard, mcbrien, would, put, the, proportion, even, higher, extending, it, to, those, who, are, in, communion, with, the, bishop, of, rome, only, in, degrees, it, comprises, 24, component, particular, churches, also, called, rites, in, the, second, vatican, council, s, decree, on, the, eastern, catholic, churches, and, in, the, code, of, canon, law, all, of, which, acknowledge, a, primacy, of, jurisdiction, of, the, bishop, of, rome, and, are, in, full, communion, with, the, holy, see, and, each, other, these, particular, churches, or, component, parts, are, the, latin, church, which, uses, a, number, of, different, liturgical, rites, of, which, the, roman, rite, is, by, far, prevalent, and, the, 23, eastern, catholic, churches, of, the, latter, particular, churches, 14, use, the, byzantine, rite, for, their, liturgy, within, the, universal, church, each, particular, church, whether, eastern, or, western, is, of, equal, dignity, finally, in, its, official, documents, the, catholic, church, though, made, up, of, several, particular, churches, continues, to, refer, to, itself, as, the, catholic, church, or, less, frequently, but, consistently, as, the, roman, catholic, church, owing, to, its, essential, link, with, the, bishop, of, rome, richard, mcbrien, in, his, book, catholicism, disagrees, with, the, synonymous, use, of, catholic, and, roman, catholic, but, is, catholic, synonymous, with, roman, catholic, and, is, it, accurate, to, refer, to, the, roman, catholic, church, as, simply, the, roman, church, the, answer, to, both, questions, is, no, the, adjective, roman, applies, more, properly, to, the, diocese, or, see, of, rome, than, to, the, worldwide, communion, of, catholic, churches, that, is, in, union, with, the, bishop, of, rome, indeed, it, strikes, some, catholics, as, contradictory, to, call, the, church, catholic, and, roman, at, one, and, the, same, time, eastern, rite, catholics, of, whom, there, are, more, than, twenty, million, also, find, the, adjective, roman, objectionable, in, addition, to, the, latin, or, roman, tradition, there, are, seven, non, latin, non, roman, ecclesial, traditions, armenian, byzantine, coptic, ethiopian, east, syriac, chaldean, west, syriac, and, maronite, each, to, the, churches, with, these, non, latin, traditions, is, as, catholic, as, the, roman, catholic, church, thus, not, all, catholics, are, roman, catholic, o, be, catholic, whether, roman, or, non, roman, in, the, ecclesiological, sense, is, to, be, in, full, communion, with, the, bishop, of, rome, and, as, such, to, be, an, integral, part, of, the, catholic, communion, of, churches, mcbrien, says, that, on, an, official, level, what, he, calls, the, communion, of, catholic, churches, always, refers, to, itself, as, the, catholic, church, however, counter, examples, such, as, seen, above, of, the, term, roman, catholic, church, being, used, by, popes, and, departments, of, the, holy, see, exist, the, latin, archdiocese, of, detroit, for, example, lists, eight, eastern, catholic, churches, each, with, its, own, bishop, as, having, one, or, more, parishes, in, what, is, also, the, territory, of, the, latin, archdiocese, yet, each, is, designated, as, being, in, full, communion, with, the, roman, church, the, eastern, orthodox, church, maintains, the, position, that, it, is, their, communion, which, actually, constitutes, the, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, eastern, orthodox, christians, consider, themselves, the, heirs, of, the, first, millennium, patriarchal, structure, that, developed, in, the, eastern, church, into, the, model, of, the, pentarchy, recognized, by, ecumenical, councils, a, theory, that, continues, to, hold, sway, in, official, greek, circles, to, the, present, day, since, the, theological, disputes, that, occurred, from, the, 9th, to, 11th, centuries, culminating, in, the, final, split, of, 1054, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, have, regarded, rome, as, a, schismatic, see, that, has, violated, the, essential, catholicity, of, the, christian, faith, by, introducing, innovations, of, doctrine, see, filioque, on, the, other, hand, the, model, of, the, pentarchy, was, never, fully, applied, in, the, western, church, which, preferred, the, theory, of, the, primacy, of, the, bishop, of, rome, favoring, ultramontanism, over, conciliarism, the, title, patriarch, of, the, west, was, rarely, used, by, the, popes, until, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, and, was, included, in, the, annuario, pontificio, from, 1863, to, 2005, being, dropped, in, the, following, year, as, never, very, clear, and, having, become, over, history, obsolete, and, practically, unusable, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, coptic, syriac, armenian, ethiopian, eritrean, malankaran, also, maintain, the, position, that, their, communion, constitutes, the, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, in, this, sense, oriental, orthodoxy, upholds, its, own, ancient, ecclesiological, traditions, of, apostolicity, apostolic, continuity, and, catholicity, universality, of, the, church, similar, notion, of, the, catholicity, was, also, maintained, in, the, former, church, of, the, east, with, its, distinctive, theological, and, ecclesiological, characteristics, and, traditions, that, notion, was, inherited, by, both, of, its, modern, secessions, the, chaldean, catholic, church, that, is, part, of, the, catholic, church, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, whose, full, official, name, is, the, holy, apostolic, catholic, assyrian, church, of, the, east, along, with, its, off, shot, in, turn, the, ancient, church, of, the, east, whose, full, official, name, is, the, holy, apostolic, catholic, ancient, church, of, the, east, these, churches, are, using, the, term, catholic, in, their, names, in, the, sense, of, traditional, catholicity, they, are, not, in, communion, with, the, catholic, church, the, augsburg, confession, found, within, the, book, of, concord, a, compendium, of, belief, of, the, lutheran, churches, teaches, that, the, faith, as, confessed, by, luther, and, his, followers, is, nothing, new, but, the, true, catholic, faith, and, that, their, churches, represent, the, true, catholic, or, universal, church, when, the, lutherans, presented, the, augsburg, confession, to, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1530, they, believe, to, have, showed, that, each, article, of, faith, and, practice, was, true, first, of, all, to, holy, scripture, and, then, also, to, the, teaching, of, the, church, fathers, and, the, councils, following, the, reformation, lutheran, churches, such, as, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, of, finland, and, the, church, of, sweden, retained, apostolic, succession, with, former, roman, catholic, bishops, simply, becoming, lutheran, and, continuing, to, occupy, their, chairs, the, 20th, century, movement, of, high, church, lutheranism, championed, evangelical, catholicity, restoring, in, some, cases, apostolic, succession, to, lutheran, churches, in, germany, where, it, was, lacking, introductory, works, on, anglicanism, such, as, the, study, of, anglicanism, typically, refer, to, the, character, of, the, anglican, tradition, as, catholic, and, reformed, which, is, in, keeping, with, the, understanding, of, anglicanism, articulated, in, the, elizabethan, settlement, of, 1559, and, in, the, works, of, the, earliest, standard, anglican, divines, such, as, richard, hooker, and, lancelot, andrewes, yet, different, strains, in, anglicanism, dating, back, to, the, english, reformation, have, emphasized, either, the, reformed, catholic, or, reformed, catholic, nature, of, the, tradition, anglican, theology, and, ecclesiology, has, thus, come, to, be, typically, expressed, in, three, distinct, yet, sometimes, overlapping, manifestations, anglo, catholicism, often, called, high, church, evangelical, anglicanism, often, called, low, church, and, latitudinarianism, broad, church, whose, beliefs, and, practices, fall, somewhere, between, the, two, though, all, elements, within, the, anglican, communion, recite, the, same, creeds, evangelical, anglicans, generally, regard, the, word, catholic, in, the, ideal, sense, given, above, in, contrast, anglo, catholics, regard, the, communion, as, a, component, of, the, whole, catholic, church, in, spiritual, and, historical, union, with, the, roman, catholic, old, catholic, and, several, eastern, churches, broad, church, anglicans, tend, to, maintain, a, mediating, view, or, consider, the, matter, one, of, adiaphora, these, anglicans, for, example, have, agreed, in, the, porvoo, agreement, to, interchangeable, ministries, and, full, eucharistic, communion, with, lutherans, the, catholic, nature, or, strain, of, the, anglican, tradition, is, expressed, doctrinally, ecumenically, chiefly, through, organizations, such, as, the, anglican, roman, catholic, international, commission, ecclesiologically, through, its, episcopal, governance, and, maintenance, of, the, historical, episcopate, and, in, liturgy, and, piety, the, 39, articles, hold, that, there, are, two, sacraments, ordained, of, christ, our, lord, in, the, gospel, that, is, to, say, baptism, and, the, supper, of, the, lord, and, that, those, five, commonly, called, sacraments, that, is, to, say, confirmation, penance, orders, matrimony, and, extreme, unction, are, not, to, be, counted, for, sacraments, of, the, gospel, some, anglo, catholics, interpret, this, to, mean, that, there, are, a, total, of, seven, sacraments, many, anglo, catholics, practice, marian, devotion, recite, the, rosary, and, the, angelus, practice, eucharistic, adoration, and, seek, the, intercession, of, saints, in, terms, of, liturgy, most, anglicans, use, candles, on, the, altar, or, communion, table, and, many, churches, use, incense, and, bells, at, the, eucharist, which, is, amongst, the, most, pronounced, anglo, catholics, referred, to, by, the, latin, derived, word, mass, used, in, the, first, prayer, book, and, in, the, american, prayer, book, of, 1979, in, numerous, churches, the, eucharist, is, celebrated, facing, the, altar, often, with, a, tabernacle, by, a, priest, assisted, by, a, deacon, and, subdeacon, anglicans, believe, in, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, though, anglo, catholics, interpret, this, to, mean, a, corporeal, presence, rather, than, a, pneumatic, presence, different, eucharistic, rites, or, orders, contain, different, if, not, necessarily, contradictory, understandings, of, salvation, for, this, reason, no, single, strain, or, manifestation, of, anglicanism, can, speak, for, the, whole, even, in, ecumenical, statements, as, issued, for, example, by, the, anglican, roman, catholic, international, commission, the, growth, of, anglo, catholicism, is, strongly, associated, with, the, oxford, movement, of, the, 19th, century, two, of, its, leading, lights, john, henry, newman, and, henry, edward, manning, both, priests, ended, up, joining, the, roman, catholic, church, becoming, cardinals, others, like, john, keble, edward, bouverie, pusey, and, charles, gore, became, influential, figures, in, anglicanism, the, previous, archbishop, of, canterbury, rowan, williams, is, a, patron, of, affirming, catholicism, a, more, liberal, movement, within, catholic, anglicanism, conservative, catholic, groups, also, exist, within, the, tradition, such, as, forward, in, faith, there, are, about, 80, million, anglicans, in, the, anglican, communion, comprising, 3, 6, of, global, christianity, the, 1932, deed, of, union, of, the, methodist, church, of, great, britain, teaches, that, the, methodist, church, claims, and, cherishes, its, place, in, the, holy, catholic, church, which, is, the, body, of, christ, it, rejoices, in, the, inheritance, of, the, apostolic, faith, and, loyally, accepts, the, fundamental, principles, of, the, historic, creeds, and, of, the, protestant, reformation, it, ever, remembers, that, in, the, providence, of, god, methodism, was, raised, up, to, spread, scriptural, holiness, through, the, land, by, the, proclamation, of, the,
