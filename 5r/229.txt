supreme, pontiff, roman, pontiff, or, sovereign, pontiff, from, the, eighth, century, until, 1870, the, pope, was, the, sovereign, or, head, of, state, of, the, papal, states, and, since, 1929, of, the, much, smaller, vatican, city, state, the, current, pope, is, francis, who, was, elected, on, 13, march, 2013, from, a, catholic, viewpoint, the, primacy, of, the, bishop, of, rome, is, largely, derived, from, his, role, as, the, apostolic, successor, to, saint, peter, to, whom, primacy, was, conferred, by, jesus, who, gave, peter, the, keys, of, heaven, and, the, powers, of, binding, and, loosing, naming, him, as, the, rock, upon, which, the, church, would, be, built, while, his, office, is, called, the, papacy, the, jurisdiction, of, the, episcopal, see, is, called, the, holy, see, it, is, the, holy, see, that, is, the, sovereign, entity, under, international, law, headquartered, in, the, distinctively, independent, vatican, city, state, a, city, state, which, forms, a, geographical, enclave, within, the, conurbation, of, rome, established, by, the, lateran, treaty, in, 1929, between, italy, and, the, holy, see, to, ensure, its, temporal, and, spiritual, independence, the, holy, see, is, recognized, by, its, adherence, at, various, levels, to, international, organizations, and, by, means, of, its, diplomatic, relations, and, political, accords, with, many, independent, states, according, to, catholic, tradition, the, apostolic, see, of, rome, was, founded, by, saint, peter, and, saint, paul, in, the, first, century, the, papacy, is, one, of, the, most, enduring, institutions, in, the, world, and, has, had, a, prominent, part, in, human, history, in, ancient, times, the, popes, helped, spread, christianity, and, intervened, to, find, resolutions, in, various, doctrinal, disputes, in, the, middle, ages, they, played, a, role, of, secular, importance, in, western, europe, often, acting, as, arbitrators, between, christian, monarchs, in, addition, to, the, expansion, of, christian, faith, and, doctrine, modern, popes, are, involved, in, ecumenism, and, interfaith, dialogue, charitable, work, and, the, defence, of, human, rights, over, time, the, papacy, accrued, broad, secular, and, political, influence, eventually, rivalling, those, of, territorial, rulers, in, recent, centuries, the, temporal, authority, of, the, papacy, has, declined, and, the, office, is, now, largely, focused, on, religious, matters, by, contrast, papal, claims, of, spiritual, authority, have, been, increasingly, firmly, expressed, over, time, culminating, in, 1870, with, the, proclamation, of, the, dogma, of, papal, infallibility, for, rare, occasions, when, the, pope, speaks, ex, cathedra, literally, from, the, chair, of, saint, peter, to, issue, a, formal, definition, of, faith, or, morals, the, pope, is, considered, one, of, the, world, s, most, powerful, people, due, to, the, extensive, diplomatic, cultural, and, spiritual, influence, of, his, position, on, both, 1, 3, billion, catholics, and, those, outside, the, catholic, faith, and, because, he, heads, the, world, s, largest, non, government, provider, of, education, and, health, care, with, a, vast, network, of, charities, the, word, pope, derives, from, the, greek, p, ppas, meaning, father, in, the, early, centuries, of, christianity, this, title, was, applied, especially, in, the, east, to, all, bishops, and, other, senior, clergy, and, later, became, reserved, in, the, west, to, the, bishop, of, rome, during, the, reign, of, pope, leo, i, 440, 461, a, reservation, made, official, only, in, the, 11th, century, the, earliest, record, of, the, use, of, the, title, of, pope, was, in, regard, to, the, by, then, deceased, patriarch, of, alexandria, heraclas, 232, 248, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, the, title, pope, in, english, dates, to, the, mid, 10th, century, when, it, was, used, in, reference, to, the, 7th, century, roman, pope, vitalian, in, an, old, english, translation, of, bede, s, historia, ecclesiastica, gentis, anglorum, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, the, pastoral, office, the, office, of, shepherding, the, church, that, was, held, by, the, apostles, as, a, group, or, college, with, saint, peter, as, their, head, is, now, held, by, their, successors, the, bishops, with, the, bishop, of, rome, the, pope, as, their, head, thus, is, derived, another, title, by, which, the, pope, is, known, that, of, supreme, pontiff, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, jesus, personally, appointed, peter, as, the, visible, head, of, the, church, and, the, catholic, church, s, dogmatic, constitution, lumen, gentium, makes, a, clear, distinction, between, apostles, and, bishops, presenting, the, latter, as, the, successors, of, the, former, with, the, pope, as, successor, of, peter, in, that, he, is, head, of, the, bishops, as, peter, was, head, of, the, apostles, some, historians, argue, against, the, notion, that, peter, was, the, first, bishop, of, rome, noting, that, the, episcopal, see, in, rome, can, be, traced, back, no, earlier, than, the, 3rd, century, the, writings, of, the, church, father, irenaeus, who, wrote, around, 180, ad, reflect, a, belief, that, peter, founded, and, organized, the, church, at, rome, moreover, irenaeus, was, not, the, first, to, write, of, peter, s, presence, in, the, early, roman, church, the, church, of, rome, wrote, in, a, letter, to, the, corinthians, which, is, traditionally, attributed, to, clement, of, rome, c, 96, about, the, persecution, of, christians, in, rome, as, the, struggles, in, our, time, and, presented, to, the, corinthians, its, heroes, first, the, greatest, and, most, just, columns, the, good, apostles, peter, and, paul, ignatius, of, antioch, wrote, shortly, after, clement, in, his, letter, from, the, city, of, smyrna, to, the, romans, he, said, he, would, not, command, them, as, peter, and, paul, did, given, this, and, other, evidence, such, as, emperor, constantine, s, erection, of, the, old, st, peter, s, basilica, on, the, location, of, st, peter, s, tomb, as, held, and, given, to, him, by, rome, s, christian, community, many, scholars, agree, that, peter, was, martyred, in, rome, under, nero, although, some, scholars, argue, that, he, may, have, been, martyred, in, palestine, though, open, to, historical, debate, first, century, christian, communities, may, have, had, a, group, of, presbyter, bishops, functioning, as, guides, of, their, local, churches, gradually, episcopal, sees, were, established, in, metropolitan, areas, antioch, may, have, developed, such, a, structure, before, rome, in, rome, there, were, over, time, at, various, junctures, rival, claimants, to, be, the, rightful, bishop, though, again, irenaeus, stressed, the, validity, of, one, line, of, bishops, from, the, time, of, st, peter, up, to, his, contemporary, pope, victor, i, and, listed, them, some, writers, claim, that, the, emergence, of, a, single, bishop, in, rome, probably, did, not, occur, until, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, in, their, view, linus, cletus, and, clement, were, possibly, prominent, presbyter, bishops, but, not, necessarily, monarchical, bishops, documents, of, the, 1st, century, and, early, second, century, indicate, that, the, bishop, of, rome, had, some, kind, of, pre, eminence, and, prominence, in, the, church, as, a, whole, as, even, a, letter, from, the, bishop, or, patriarch, of, antioch, acknowledged, the, bishop, of, rome, as, a, first, among, equals, though, the, detail, of, what, this, meant, is, unclear, sources, suggest, that, at, first, the, terms, episcopos, and, presbyter, were, used, interchangeably, with, the, consensus, among, scholars, being, that, by, the, turn, of, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, local, congregations, were, led, by, bishops, and, presbyters, whose, duties, of, office, overlapped, or, were, indistinguishable, from, one, another, some, say, that, there, was, probably, no, single, monarchical, bishop, in, rome, before, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, and, likely, later, in, the, early, christian, era, rome, and, a, few, other, cities, had, claims, on, the, leadership, of, worldwide, church, james, the, just, known, as, the, brother, of, the, lord, served, as, head, of, the, jerusalem, church, which, is, still, honoured, as, the, mother, church, in, orthodox, tradition, alexandria, had, been, a, center, of, jewish, learning, and, became, a, center, of, christian, learning, rome, had, a, large, congregation, early, in, the, apostolic, period, whom, paul, the, apostle, addressed, in, his, epistle, to, the, romans, and, according, to, tradition, paul, was, martyred, there, during, the, 1st, century, of, the, church, c, 30, 130, the, roman, capital, became, recognized, as, a, christian, center, of, exceptional, importance, the, church, there, at, the, end, of, the, century, wrote, an, epistle, to, the, church, in, corinth, intervening, in, a, major, dispute, and, apologizing, for, not, having, taken, action, earlier, there, are, a, few, other, references, of, that, time, to, recognition, of, the, authoritative, primacy, of, the, roman, see, outside, of, rome, in, the, ravenna, document, of, 13, october, 2007, theologians, chosen, by, the, catholic, and, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, stated, both, sides, agree, that, this, canonical, taxis, was, recognised, by, all, in, the, era, of, the, undivided, church, further, they, agree, that, rome, as, the, church, that, presides, in, love, according, to, the, phrase, of, st, ignatius, of, antioch, to, the, romans, prologue, occupied, the, first, place, in, the, taxis, and, that, the, bishop, of, rome, was, therefore, the, protos, among, the, patriarchs, they, disagree, however, on, the, interpretation, of, the, historical, evidence, from, this, era, regarding, the, prerogatives, of, the, bishop, of, rome, as, protos, a, matter, that, was, already, understood, in, different, ways, in, the, first, millennium, in, ad, 195, pope, victor, i, in, what, is, seen, as,

of, clergy, in, their, states, and, fiefdoms, their, personal, interests, causing, corruption, among, the, clergy, this, practice, had, become, common, because, often, the, prelates, and, secular,

of, pope, gregory, vii, in, 1073, who, adopted, a, series, of, measures, in, the, movement, known, as, the, gregorian, reform, in, order, to, fight, strongly, against, simony, and, the, abuse, of, civil, power, and, try, to, restore, ecclesiastical, discipline, including, clerical, celibacy, this, conflict, between, popes, and, secular, autocratic, rulers, such, as, the, holy, roman, emperor, henry, iv, and, king, henry, i, of, england, known, as, the, investiture, controversy, was, only, resolved, in, 1122, by, the, concordat, of, worms, in, which, pope, callixtus, ii, decreed, that, clerics, were, to, be, invested, by, clerical, leaders, and, temporal, rulers, by, lay, investiture, soon, after, pope, alexander, iii, began, reforms, that, would, lead, to, the, establishment, of,

pope, was, effectively, an, ally, of, the, kingdom, of, france, alienating, france, s, enemies, such, as, the, kingdom, of, england, the, pope, was, understood, to, have, the, power, to, draw, on, the, treasury, of, merit, built, up, by, the, saints, and, by, christ, so, that, he, could, grant, indulgences, reducing, one, s, time, in, purgatory, the, concept, that, a, monetary, fine, or, donation, accompanied, contrition, confession, and, prayer, eventually, gave, way, to, the, common, assumption, that, indulgences, depended, on, a, simple, monetary, contribution, the, popes, condemned, misunderstandings, and, abuses, but, were, too, pressed, for, income, to, exercise, effective, control, over, indulgences, popes, also, contended, with, the, cardinals, who, sometimes,

conciliarism, to, gain, broad, acceptance, after, the, 15th, century, is, taken, as, a, factor, in, the, protestant, reformation, various, antipopes, challenged, papal, authority, especially, during, the, western, schism, 1378, 1417, it, came, to, a, close, when, the, council, of, constance, at, the, high, point, of, concilliarism, decided, among, the, papal, claimants, the, eastern, church,

the, bishop, of, rome, as, an, influential, figure, within, the, church, with, some, emphasizing, the, importance, of, adherence, to, rome, s, teachings, and, decisions, such, references, served, to,

switch, the, positions, of, clement, and, anacletus, for, if, the, lineal, succession, of, bishops, is, to, be, taken, into, account, with, how, much, more, certainty, and, benefit, to, the, church, do, we, reckon, back, till, we, reach, peter, himself, to, whom, as, bearing, in, a, figure, the, whole, church, the, lord, said, upon, this, rock, will, i, build, my, church, and, the, gates, of, hell, shall, not, prevail, against, it, matthew, 16, 18, the, successor, of, peter, was, linus, and, his, successors, in, unbroken, continuity, were, these, clement, anacletus, evaristus, eusebius, c, 260, 265, 339, mentions, linus, as, saint, peter, s, successor, and, clement, as, the, third, bishop, of, rome, in, his, book, church, history, as, recorded, by, eusebius, clement, worked, with, saint, paul, as, his, co, laborer, as, to, the, rest, of, his, followers, paul, testifies, that, crescens, was, sent, to, gaul, but, linus, whom, he, mentions, in, the, second, epistle, to, timothy, as, his, companion, at, rome, was, peter, s, successor, in, the, episcopate, of, the, church, there, as, has, already, been, shown, clement, also, who, was, appointed, third, bishop, of, the, church, at, rome, was, as, paul, testifies, his, co, laborer, and, fellow, soldier, tertullian, c, 155, c, 220, ad, wrote, in, his, work, the, prescription, against, heretics, about, the, authority, of, the, church, in, rome, in, this, work, tertullian, said, that, the, church, in, rome, has, the, authority, of, the, apostles, because, of, its, apostolic, foundation, since, moreover, you, are, close, upon, italy, you, have, rome, from, which, there, comes, even, into, our, own, hands, the, very, authority, of, apostles, themselves, how, happy, is, its, church, on, which, apostles, poured, forth, all, their, doctrine, along, with, their, blood, where, peter, endures, a, passion, like, his, lord, s, where, paul, wins, his, crown, in, a, death, like, john, s, where, the, apostle, john, was, first, plunged, unhurt, into, boiling, oil, and, thence, remitted, to, his, island, exile, according, to, the, same, book, clement, of, rome, was, ordained, by, saint, peter, as, the, bishop, of, rome, for, this, is, the, manner, in, which, the, apostolic, churches, transmit, their, registers, as, the, church, of, smyrna, which, records, that, polycarp, was, placed, therein, by, john, as, also, the, church, of, rome, which, makes, clement, to, have, been, ordained, in, like, manner, by, peter, optatus, the, bishop, of, milevis, in, numidia, today, s, algeria, and, a, contemporary, of, the, donatist, schism, presents, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, origins, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, donatists, as, well, as, the, events, and, debates, surrounding, the, schism, in, his, book, the, schism, of, the, donatists, 367, a, d, in, the, book, optatus, wrote, about, the, position, of, the, bishop, of, rome, in, maintaining, the, unity, of, the, church, you, cannot, deny, that, you, are, aware, that, in, the, city, of, rome, the, episcopal, chair, was, given, first, to, peter, the, chair, in, which, peter, sat, the, same, who, was, head, that, is, why, he, is, also, called, cephas, of, all, the, apostles, the, one, chair, in, which, unity, is, maintained, by, all, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, within, the, christian, community, the, bishops, as, a, body, have, succeeded, to, the, body, of, the, apostles, apostolic, succession, and, the, bishop, of, rome, has, succeeded, to, saint, peter, scriptural, texts, proposed, in, support, of, peter, s, special, position, in, relation, to, the, church, include, i, tell, you, you, are, peter, and, on, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, and, the, gates, of, hell, shall, not, prevail, against, it, i, will, give, you, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, and, whatever, you, bind, on, earth, shall, be, bound, in, heaven, and, whatever, you, loose, on, earth, shall, be, loosed, in, heaven, simon, simon, behold, satan, demanded, to, have, you, that, he, might, sift, you, like, wheat, but, i, have, prayed, for, you, that, your, faith, may, not, fail, and, when, you, have, turned, again, strengthen, your, brothers, feed, my, sheep, the, symbolic, keys, in, the, papal, coats, of, arms, are, a, reference, to, the, phrase, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, in, the, first, of, these, texts, some, protestant, writers, have, maintained, that, the, rock, that, jesus, speaks, of, in, this, text, is, jesus, himself, or, the, faith, expressed, by, peter, this, idea, is, undermined, by, the, biblical, usage, of, cephas, which, is, the, masculine, form, of, rock, in, aramaic, to, describe, peter, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, comments, that, the, consensus, of, the, great, majority, of, scholars, today, is, that, the, most, obvious, and, traditional, understanding, should, be, construed, namely, that, rock, refers, to, the, person, of, peter, according, to, the, catholic, church, the, pope, is, also, the, new, eliakim, a, figure, in, the, old, testament, of, the, bible, who, directed, the, affairs, of, the, royal, court, managed, the, palace, staff, and, handled, state, affairs, isaiah, also, describes, him, as, having, the, key, to, the, house, of, david, which, symbolizes, his, authority, and, power, both, matthew, 16, 18, 19, and, isaiah, 22, 22, show, similarities, between, eliakim, and, peter, getting, keys, which, symbolize, power, eliakim, gets, the, power, to, close, and, open, while, peter, gets, the, power, to, bind, and, loose, according, to, the, book, of, isaiah, eliakim, receives, the, keys, and, power, to, close, and, open, i, will, place, the, key, of, the, house, of, david, on, his, shoulder, what, he, opens, no, one, will, shut, what, he, shuts, no, one, will, open, according, to, book, of, matthew, peter, also, gets, keys, and, power, to, bind, and, loose, i, will, give, you, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, and, whatever, you, bind, on, earth, shall, be, bound, in, heaven, and, whatever, you, loose, on, earth, shall, be, loosed, in, heaven, in, the, books, of, isaiah, 22, 3, and, matthew, 16, 18, both, eliakim, and, peter, are, compared, to, an, object, eliakim, to, a, peg, a, structure, that, is, driven, into, a, wall, or, other, structure, to, provide, support, and, stability, while, peter, to, a, rock, and, i, will, fasten, him, like, a, peg, in, a, secure, place, and, he, will, become, a, throne, of, honor, to, his, father, s, house, in, matthew, 16, 18, peter, was, compared, to, a, rock, and, i, tell, you, you, are, peter, and, on, this, rock, i, will, build, my, church, and, the, gates, of, hell, shall, not, prevail, against, it, the, pope, was, originally, chosen, by, those, senior, clergymen, resident, in, and, near, rome, in, 1059, the, electorate, was, restricted, to, the, cardinals, of, the, holy, roman, church, and, the, individual, votes, of, all, cardinal, electors, were, made, equal, in, 1179, the, electors, are, now, limited, to, those, who, have, not, reached, 80, on, the, day, before, the, death, or, resignation, of, a, pope, the, pope, does, not, need, to, be, a, cardinal, elector, or, indeed, a, cardinal, since, the, pope, is, the, bishop, of, rome, only, those, who, can, be, ordained, a, bishop, can, be, elected, which, means, that, any, male, baptized, catholic, is, eligible, the, last, to, be, elected, when, not, yet, a, bishop, was, gregory, xvi, in, 1831, the, last, to, be, elected, when, not, even, a, priest, was, leo, x, in, 1513, and, the, last, to, be, elected, when, not, a, cardinal, was, urban, vi, in, 1378, if, someone, who, is, not, a, bishop, is, elected, he, must, be, given, episcopal, ordination, before, the, election, is, announced, to, the, people, the, second, council, of, lyon, was, convened, on, 7, may, 1274, to, regulate, the, election, of, the, pope, this, council, decreed, that, the, cardinal, electors, must, meet, within, ten, days, of, the, pope, s, death, and, that, they, must, remain, in, seclusion, until, a, pope, has, been, elected, this, was, prompted, by, the, three, year, sede, vacante, following, the, death, of, clement, iv, in, 1268, by, the, mid, 16th, century, the, electoral, process, had, evolved, into, its, present, form, allowing, for, variation, in, the, time, between, the, death, of, the, pope, and, the, meeting, of, the, cardinal, electors, traditionally, the, vote, was, conducted, by, acclamation, by, selection, by, committee, or, by, plenary, vote, acclamation, was, the, simplest, procedure, consisting, entirely, of, a, voice, vote, since, 1878, the, election, of, the, pope, has, taken, place, in, the, sistine, chapel, in, a, sequestered, meeting, called, a, conclave, so, called, because, the, cardinal, electors, are, theoretically, locked, in, cum, clave, i, e, with, key, until, they, elect, a, new, pope, three, cardinals, are, chosen, by, lot, to, collect, the, votes, of, absent, cardinal, electors, by, reason, of, illness, three, are, chosen, by, lot, to, count, the, votes, and, three, are, chosen, by, lot, to, review, the, count, of, the, votes, the, ballots, are, distributed, and, each, cardinal, elector, writes, the, name, of, his, choice, on, it, and, pledges, aloud, that, he, is, voting, for, one, whom, under, god, i, think, ought, to, be, elected, before, folding, and, depositing, his, vote, on, a, plate, atop, a, large, chalice, placed, on, the, altar, for, the, papal, conclave, 2005, a, special, urn, was, used, for, this, purpose, instead, of, a, chalice, and, plate, the, plate, is, then, used, to, drop, the, ballot, into, the, chalice, making, it, difficult, for, electors, to, insert, multiple, ballots, before, being, read, the, ballots, are, counted, while, still, folded, if, the, number, of, ballots, does, not, match, the, number, of, electors, the, ballots, are, burned, unopened, and, a, new, vote, is, held, otherwise, each, ballot, is, read, aloud, by, the, presiding, cardinal, who, pierces, the, ballot, with, a, needle, and, thread, stringing, all, the, ballots, together, and, tying, the, ends, of, the, thread, to, ensure, accuracy, and, honesty, balloting, continues, until, someone, is, elected, by, a, two, thirds, majority, with, the, promulgation, of, universi, dominici, gregis, in, 1996, a, simple, majority, after, a, deadlock, of, twelve, days, was, allowed, but, this, was, revoked, by, pope, benedict, xvi, by, motu, proprio, in, 2007, one, of, the, most, prominent, aspects, of, the, papal, election, process, is, the, means, by, which, the, results, of, a, ballot, are, announced, to, the, world, once, the, ballots, are, counted, and, bound, together, they, are, burned, in, a, special, stove, erected, in, the, sistine, chapel, with, the, smoke, escaping, through, a, small, chimney, visible, from, saint, peter, s, square, the, ballots, from, an, unsuccessful, vote, are, burned, along, with, a, chemical, compound, to, create, black, smoke, or, fumata, nera, traditionally, wet, straw, was, used, to, produce, the, black, smoke, but, this, was, not, completely, reliable, the, chemical, compound, is, more, reliable, than, the, straw, when, a, vote, is, successful, the, ballots, are, burned, alone, sending, white, smoke, fumata, bianca, through, the, chimney, and, announcing, to, the, world, the, election, of, a, new, pope, starting, with, the, papal, conclave, 2005, church, bells, are, also, rung, as, a, signal, that, a, new, pope, has, been, chosen, the, dean, of, the, college, of, cardinals, then, asks, two, solemn, questions, of, the, man, who, has, been, elected, first, he, asks, do, you, freely, accept, your, election, as, supreme, pontiff, if, he, replies, with, the, word, accepto, his, reign, begins, at, that, instant, in, practice, any, cardinal, who, intends, not, to, accept, will, explicitly, state, this, before, he, receives, a, sufficient, number, of, votes, to, become, pope, the, dean, asks, next, by, what, name, shall, you, be, called, the, new, pope, announces, the, regnal, name, he, has, chosen, if, the, dean, himself, is, elected, pope, the, vice, dean, performs, this, task, the, new, pope, is, led, to, the, room, of, tears, a, dressing, room, where, three, sets, of, white, papal, vestments, immantatio, await, in, three, sizes, donning, the, appropriate, vestments, and, reemerging, into, the, sistine, chapel, the, new, pope, is, given, the, fisherman, s, ring, by, the, camerlengo, of, the, holy, roman, church, the, pope, assumes, a, place, of, honour, as, the, rest, of, the, cardinals, wait, in, turn, to, offer, their, first, obedience, adoratio, and, to, receive, his, blessing, the, cardinal, protodeacon, announces, from, a, balcony, over, st, peter, s, square, the, following, proclamation, annuntio, vobis, gaudium, magnum, habemus, papam, i, announce, to, you, a, great, joy, we, have, a, pope, he, announces, the, new, pope, s, christian, name, along, with, his, newly, chosen, regnal, name, until, 1978, the, pope, s, election, was, followed, in, a, few, days, by, the, papal, coronation, which, started, with, a, procession, with, great, pomp, and, circumstance, from, the, sistine, chapel, to, st, peter, s, basilica, with, the, newly, elected, pope, borne, in, the, sedia, gestatoria, after, a, solemn, papal, mass, the, new, pope, was, crowned, with, the, triregnum, papal, tiara, and, he, gave, for, the, first, time, as, pope, the, famous, blessing, urbi, et, orbi, to, the, city, and, to, the, world, another, renowned, part, of, the, coronation, was, the, lighting, of, a, bundle, of, flax, at, the, top, of, a, gilded, pole, which, would, flare, brightly, for, a, moment, and, then, promptly, extinguish, as, he, said, sic, transit, gloria, mundi, thus, passes, worldly, glory, a, similar, warning, against, papal, hubris, made, on, this, occasion, was, the, traditional, exclamation, annos, petri, non, videbis, reminding, the, newly, crowned, pope, that, he, would, not, live, to, see, his, rule, lasting, as, long, as, that, of, st, peter, according, to, tradition, he, headed, the, church, for, 35, years, and, has, thus, far, been, the, longest, reigning, pope, in, the, history, of, the, catholic, church, the, latin, term, sede, vacante, while, the, see, is, vacant, refers, to, a, papal, interregnum, the, period, between, the, death, or, resignation, of, a, pope, and, the, election, of, his, successor, from, this, term, is, derived, the, term, sedevacantism, which, designates, a, category, of, dissident, catholics, who, maintain, that, there, is, no, canonically, and, legitimately, elected, pope, and, that, there, is, therefore, a, sede, vacante, for, centuries, from, 1378, on, those, elected, to, the, papacy, were, predominantly, italians, prior, to, the, election, of, the, polish, born, john, paul, ii, in, 1978, the, last, non, italian, was, adrian, vi, of, the, netherlands, elected, in, 1522, john, paul, ii, was, followed, by, election, of, the, german, born, benedict, xvi, who, was, in, turn, followed, by, argentine, born, francis, the, first, non, european, after, 1272, years, and, the, first, latin, american, albeit, of, italian, ancestry, the, current, regulations, regarding, a, papal, interregnum, that, is, a, sede, vacante, vacant, seat, were, promulgated, by, pope, john, paul, ii, in, his, 1996, document, universi, dominici, gregis, during, the, sede, vacante, period, the, college, of, cardinals, is, collectively, responsible, for, the, government, of, the, church, and, of, the, vatican, itself, under, the, direction, of, the, camerlengo, of, the, holy, roman, church, canon, law, specifically, forbids, the, cardinals, from, introducing, any, innovation, in, the, government, of, the, church, during, the, vacancy, of, the, holy, see, any, decision, that, requires, the, assent, of, the, pope, has, to, wait, until, the, new, pope, has, been, elected, and, accepts, office, in, recent, centuries, when, a, pope, was, judged, to, have, died, it, was, reportedly, traditional, for, the, cardinal, camerlengo, to, confirm, the, death, ceremonially, by, gently, tapping, the, pope, s, head, thrice, with, a, silver, hammer, calling, his, birth, name, each, time, this, was, not, done, on, the, deaths, of, popes, john, paul, i, and, john, paul, ii, the, cardinal, camerlengo, retrieves, the, ring, of, the, fisherman, and, cuts, it, in, two, in, the, presence, of, the, cardinals, the, pope, s, seals, are, defaced, to, keep, them, from, ever, being, used, again, and, his, personal, apartment, is, sealed, the, body, lies, in, state, for, several, days, before, being, interred, in, the, crypt, of, a, leading, church, or, cathedral, all, popes, who, have, died, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, have, been, interred, in, st, peter, s, basilica, a, nine, day, period, of, mourning, novendialis, follows, the, interment, it, is, highly, unusual, for, a, pope, to, resign, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, states, if, it, happens, that, the, roman, pontiff, resigns, his, office, it, is, required, for, validity, that, the, resignation, is, made, freely, and, properly, manifested, but, not, that, it, is, accepted, by, anyone, benedict, xvi, who, vacated, the, holy, see, on, 28, february, 2013, was, the, most, recent, to, do, so, and, the, first, since, gregory, xii, s, resignation, in, 1415, popes, adopt, a, new, name, on, their, accession, known, as, papal, name, in, italian, and, latin, currently, after, a, new, pope, is, elected, and, accepts, the, election, he, is, asked, by, what, name, shall, you, be, called, the, new, pope, chooses, the, name, by, which, he, will, be, known, from, that, point, on, the, senior, cardinal, deacon, or, cardinal, protodeacon, then, appears, on, the, balcony, of, saint, peter, s, to, proclaim, the, new, pope, by, his, birth, name, and, announce, his, papal, name, in, latin, it, s, customary, when, referring, to, popes, to, translate, the, regnal, name, into, all, local, languages, for, example, the, current, pope, bears, the, papal, name, papa, franciscus, in, latin, and, papa, francesco, in, italian, but, papa, francisco, in, his, native, spanish, pope, francis, in, english, etc, the, official, list, of, titles, of, the, pope, in, the, order, in, which, they, are, given, in, the, annuario, pontificio, is, bishop, of, rome, vicar, of, jesus, christ, successor, of, the, prince, of, the, apostles, supreme, pontiff, of, the, universal, church, patriarch, of, the, west, primate, of, italy, archbishop, and, metropolitan, of, the, roman, province, sovereign, of, the, vatican, city, state, servant, of, the, servants, of, god, the, best, known, title, that, of, pope, does, not, appear, in, the, official, list, but, is, commonly, used, in, the, titles, of, documents, and, appears, in, abbreviated, form, in, their, signatures, thus, paul, vi, signed, as, paulus, pp, vi, the, pp, standing, for, papa, pontifex, pope, and, pontiff, the, title, pope, was, from, the, early, 3rd, century, an, honorific, designation, used, for, any, bishop, in, the, west, in, the, east, it, was, used, only, for, the, bishop, of, alexandria, marcellinus, d, 304, is, the, first, bishop, of, rome, shown, in, sources, to, have, had, the, title, pope, used, of, him, from, the, 6th, century, the, imperial, chancery, of, constantinople, normally, reserved, this, designation, for, the, bishop, of, rome, from, the, early, 6th, century, it, began, to, be, confined, in, the, west, to, the, bishop, of, rome, a, practice, that, was, firmly, in, place, by, the, 11th, century, in, eastern, christianity, where, the, title, pope, is, used, also, of, the, bishop, of, alexandria, the, bishop, of, rome, is, often, referred, to, as, the, pope, of, rome, regardless, of, whether, the, speaker, or, writer, is, in, communion, with, rome, or, not, vicar, of, jesus, christ, vicarius, iesu, christi, is, one, of, the, official, titles, of, the, pope, given, in, the, annuario, pontificio, it, is, commonly, used, in, the, slightly, abbreviated, form, vicar, of, christ, vicarius, christi, while, it, is, only, one, of, the, terms, with, which, the, pope, is, referred, to, as, vicar, it, is, more, expressive, of, his, supreme, headship, of, the, church, on, earth, which, he, bears, in, virtue, of, the, commission, of, christ, and, with, vicarial, power, derived, from, him, a, vicarial, power, believed, to, have, been, conferred, on, saint, peter, when, christ, said, to, him, feed, my, lambs, feed, my, sheep, the, first, record, of, the, application, of, this, title, to, a, bishop, of, rome, appears, in, a, synod, of, 495, with, reference, to, gelasius, i, but, at, that, time, and, down, to, the, 9th, century, other, bishops, too, referred, to, themselves, as, vicars, of, christ, and, for, another, four, centuries, this, description, was, sometimes, used, of, kings, and, even, judges, as, it, had, been, used, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, to, refer, to, the, byzantine, emperor, earlier, still, in, the, 3rd, century, tertullian, used, vicar, of, christ, to, refer, to, the, holy, spirit, sent, by, jesus, its, use, specifically, for, the, pope, appears, in, the, 13th, century, in, connection, with, the, reforms, of, pope, innocent, iii, as, can, be, observed, already, in, his, 1199, letter, to, leo, i, king, of, armenia, other, historians, suggest, that, this, title, was, already, used, in, this, way, in, association, with, the, pontificate, of, eugene, iii, 1145, 1153, this, title, vicar, of, christ, is, thus, not, used, of, the, pope, alone, and, has, been, used, of, all, bishops, since, the, early, centuries, the, second, vatican, council, referred, to, all, bishops, as, vicars, and, ambassadors, of, christ, and, this, description, of, the, bishops, was, repeated, by, john, paul, ii, in, his, encyclical, ut, unum, sint, 95, the, difference, is, that, the, other, bishops, are, vicars, of, christ, for, their, own, local, churches, the, pope, is, vicar, of, christ, for, the, whole, church, on, at, least, one, occasion, the, title, vicar, of, god, a, reference, to, christ, as, god, was, used, of, the, pope, the, title, vicar, of, peter, vicarius, petri, is, used, only, of, the, pope, not, of, other, bishops, variations, of, it, include, vicar, of, the, prince, of, the, apostles, vicarius, principis, apostolorum, and, vicar, of, the, apostolic, see, vicarius, sedis, apostolicae, saint, boniface, described, pope, gregory, ii, as, vicar, of, peter, in, the, oath, of, fealty, that, he, took, in, 722, in, today, s, roman, missal, the, description, vicar, of, peter, is, found, also, in, the, collect, of, the, mass, for, a, saint, who, was, a, pope, the, term, pontiff, is, derived, from, the, latin, pontifex, which, literally, means, bridge, builder, pons, facere, and, which, designated, a, member, of, the, principal, college, of, priests, in, pagan, rome, the, latin, word, was, translated, into, ancient, greek, variously, as, ancient, greek, ancient, greek, ancient, greek, ancient, greek, hierophant, or, ancient, greek, archiereus, high, priest, the, head, of, the, college, was, known, as, the, latin, pontifex, maximus, the, greatest, pontiff, in, christian, use, pontifex, appears, in, the, vulgate, translation, of, the, new, testament, to, indicate, the, high, priest, of, israel, in, the, original, koine, greek, the, term, came, to, be,

by, continuing, after, his, election, to, wear, the, white, habit, of, the, dominican, order, in, reality, the, basic, papal, attire, was, white, long, before, the, earliest, document, that, describes, it, as, such, is, the, ordo, xiii, a, book, of, ceremonies, compiled, in, about, 1274, later, books, of, ceremonies, describe, the, pope, as, wearing, a, red, mantle, mozzetta, camauro,

church, of, christ, the, council, established, the, following, canons, if, anyone, says, that, the, blessed, apostle, peter, was, not, established, by, the, lord, christ, as, the, chief, of, all, the, apostles, and, the, visible, head, of, the, whole, militant, church, or, that, the, same, received, great, honour, but, did, not, receive, from, the, same, our, lord, jesus, christ, directly, and, immediately, the, primacy, in, true, and, proper, jurisdiction, let, him, be, anathema, if, anyone, says, that, it, is, not, from, the, institution, of, christ, the, lord, himself, or, by, divine, right, that, the, blessed, peter, has, perpetual, successors, in, the, primacy, over, the, universal, church, or, that, the, roman, pontiff, is, not, the, successor, of, blessed, peter, in, the, same, primacy, let, him, be, anathema, if, anyone, thus, speaks, that, the, roman, pontiff, has, only, the, office, of, inspection, or, direction, but, not, the, full, and, supreme, power, of, jurisdiction, over, the, universal, church, not, only, in, things, which, pertain, to, faith, and, morals, but, also, in, those, which, pertain, to, the, discipline, and, government, of, the, church, spread, over, the, whole, world, or, that, he, possesses, only, the, more, important, parts, but, not, the, whole, plenitude, of, this, supreme, power, or, that, this, power, of, his, is, not, ordinary, and, immediate, or, over, the, churches, altogether, and, individually, and, over, the, pastors, and, the, faithful, altogether, and, individually, let, him, be, anathema, we, adhering, faithfully, to, the, tradition, received, from, the, beginning, of, the, christian, faith, to, the, glory, of, god, our, saviour, the, elevation, of, the, catholic, religion, and, the, salvation, of, christian, peoples, with, the, approbation, of, the, sacred, council, teach, and, explain, that, the, dogma, has, been, divinely, revealed, that, the, roman, pontiff, when, he, speaks, ex, cathedra, that, is, when, carrying, out, the, duty, of, the, pastor, and, teacher, of, all, christians, by, his, supreme, apostolic, authority, he, defines, a, doctrine, of, faith, or, morals, to, be, held, by, the, universal, church, through, the, divine, assistance, promised, him, in, blessed, peter, operates, with, that, infallibility, with, which, the, divine, redeemer, wished, that, his, church, be, instructed, in, defining, doctrine, on, faith, and, morals, and, so, such, definitions, of, the, roman, pontiff, from, himself, but, not, from, the, consensus, of, the, church, are, unalterable, but, if, anyone, presumes, to, contradict, this, definition, of, ours, which, may, god, forbid, let, him, be, anathema, in, its, dogmatic, constitution, on, the, church, 1964, the, second, vatican, council, declared, among, the, principal, duties, of, bishops, the, preaching, of, the, gospel, occupies, an, eminent, place, for, bishops, are, preachers, of, the, faith, who, lead, new, disciples, to, christ, and, they, are, authentic, teachers, that, is, teachers, endowed, with, the, authority, of, christ, who, preach, to, the, people, committed, to, them, the, faith, they, must, believe, and, put, into, practice, and, by, the, light, of, the, holy, spirit, illustrate, that, faith, they, bring, forth, from, the, treasury, of, revelation, new, things, and, old, making, it, bear, fruit, and, vigilantly, warding, off, any, errors, that, threaten, their, flock, bishops, teaching, in, communion, with, the, roman, pontiff, are, to, be, respected, by, all, as, witnesses, to, divine, and, catholic, truth, in, matters, of, faith, and, morals, the, bishops, speak, in, the, name, of, christ, and, the, faithful, are, to, accept, their, teaching, and, adhere, to, it, with, a, religious, assent, this, religious, submission, of, mind, and, will, must, be, shown, in, a, special, way, to, the, authentic, magisterium, of, the, roman, pontiff, even, when, he, is, not, speaking, ex, cathedra, that, is, it, must, be, shown, so, that, his, supreme, magisterium, is, acknowledged, with, reverence, the, judgments, made, by, him, are, sincerely, adhered, to, according, to, his, manifest, mind, and, will, his, mind, and, will, in, the, matter, may, be, known, either, from, the, character, of, the, documents, from, his, frequent, repetition, of, the, same, doctrine, or, from, his, manner, of, speaking, this, infallibility, with, which, the, divine, redeemer, willed, his, church, to, be, endowed, in, defining, doctrine, of, faith, and, morals, extends, as, far, as, the, deposit, of, revelation, extends, which, must, be, religiously, guarded, and, faithfully, expounded, and, this, is, the, infallibility, which, the, roman, pontiff, the, head, of, the, college, of, bishops, enjoys, in, virtue, of, his, office, when, as, the, supreme, shepherd, and, teacher, of, all, the, faithful, who, confirms, his, brethren, in, their, faith, by, a, definitive, act, he, proclaims, a, doctrine, of, faith, or, morals, and, therefore, his, definitions, of, themselves, and, not, from, the, consent, of, the, church, are, justly, styled, irreformable, since, they, are, pronounced, with, the, assistance, of, the, holy, spirit, promised, to, him, in, blessed, peter, and, therefore, they, need, no, approval, of, others, nor, do, they, allow, an, appeal, to, any, other, judgment, for, then, the, roman, pontiff, is, not, pronouncing, judgment, as, a, private, person, but, as, the, supreme, teacher, of, the, universal, church, in, whom, the, charism, of, infallibility, of, the, church, itself, is, individually, present, he, is, expounding, or, defending, a, doctrine, of, catholic, faith, the, infallibility, promised, to, the, church, resides, also, in, the, body, of, bishops, when, that, body, exercises, the, supreme, magisterium, with, the, successor, of, peter, to, these, definitions, the, assent, of, the, church, can, never, be, wanting, on, account, of, the, activity, of, that, same, holy, spirit, by, which, the, whole, flock, of, christ, is, preserved, and, progresses, in, unity, of, faith, on, 11, october, 2012, on, the, occasion, of, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, opening, of, the, second, vatican, council, 60, prominent, theologians, including, hans, k, ng, put, out, a, declaration, stating, that, the, intention, of, vatican, ii, to, balance, authority, in, the, church, has, not, been, realized, many, of, the, key, insights, of, vatican, ii, have, not, at, all, or, only, partially, been, implemented, a, principal, source, of, present, day, stagnation, lies, in, misunderstanding, and, abuse, affecting, the, exercise, of, authority, in, our, church, the, pope, s, official, seat, is, in, the, archbasilica, of, saint, john, lateran, considered, the, cathedral, of, the, diocese, of, rome, and, his, official, residence, is, the, apostolic, palace, he, also, possesses, a, summer, residence, at, castel, gandolfo, situated,

lineal, succession, from, the, saint, peter, one, of, the, twelve, apostles, consequently, rome, has, traditionally, occupied, a, central, position, in, the, catholic, church, although, this, is, not, necessarily, so, the, pope, derives, his, pontificate, from, being, the, bishop, of, rome, but, is, not, required, to, live, there, according, to, the, latin, formula, ubi, papa, ibi, curia, wherever,

wished, to, castigate, his, abuse, of, power, what, lutherans, understood, as, a, papal, claim, to, unlimited, authority, over, everything, and, everyone, reminded, them, of, the, apocalyptic,
