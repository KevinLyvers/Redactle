in, religion, a, relic, is, an, object, or, article, of, religious, significance, from, the, past, it, usually, consists, of, the, physical, remains, or, personal, effects, of, a, saint, or, other, person, preserved, for, the, purpose, of, veneration, as, a, tangible, memorial, relics, are, an, important, aspect, of, some, forms, of, buddhism, christianity, islam, shamanism, and, many, other, religions, relic, derives, from, the, latin, reliquiae, meaning, remains, and, a, form, of, the, latin, verb, relinquere, to, leave, behind, or, abandon, a, reliquary, is, a, shrine, that, houses, one, or, more, religious, relics, in, ancient, greece, a, city, or, sanctuary, might, claim, to, possess, without, necessarily, displaying, the, remains, of, a, venerated, hero, as, a, part, of, a, hero, cult, other, venerable, objects, associated, with, the, hero, were, more, likely, to, be, on, display, in, sanctuaries, such, as, spears, shields, or, other, weaponry, chariots, ships, or, figureheads, furniture, such, as, chairs, or, tripods, and, clothing, the, sanctuary, of, the, leucippides, at, sparta, claimed, to, display, the, egg, of, leda, the, bones, were, not, regarded, as, holding, a, particular, power, derived, from, the, hero, with, some, exceptions, such, as, the, divine, shoulder, of, pelops, held, at, olympia, miracles, and, healing, were, not, regularly, attributed, to, them, rather, their, presence, was, meant, to, serve, a, tutelary, function, as, the, tomb, of, oedipus, was, said, to, protect, athens, the, bones, of, orestes, and, theseus, were, supposed, to, have, been, stolen, or, removed, from, their, original, resting, place, and, reburied, on, the, advice, of, the, delphic, oracle, the, spartans, searched, for, the, bones, of, orestes, and, brought, them, home, without, which, they, had, been, told, they, could, not, expect, victory, in, their, war, against, the, neighboring, tegeans, plutarch, says, that, the, athenians, were, likewise, instructed, by, the, oracle, to, locate, and, steal, the, relics, of, theseus, from, the, dolopians, the, body, of, the, legendary, eurystheus, was, also, supposed, to, protect, athens, from, enemy, attack, and, in, thebes, that, of, the, prophet, amphiaraus, whose, cult, was, oracular, and, healing, plutarch, narrates, transferrals, similar, to, that, of, theseus, for, the, bodies, of, the, historical, demetrius, i, of, macedon, and, phocion, the, good, the, bones, or, ashes, of, aesculapius, at, epidaurus, and, of, perdiccas, i, at, macedon, were, treated, with, the, deepest, veneration, as, with, the, relics, of, theseus, the, bones, are, sometimes, described, in, literary, sources, as, gigantic, an, indication, of, the, hero, s, larger, than, life, status, on, the, basis, of, their, reported, size, it, has, been, conjectured, that, such, bones, were, those, of, prehistoric, creatures, the, startling, discovery, of, which, may, have, prompted, the, sanctifying, of, the, site, the, head, of, the, poet, prophet, orpheus, was, supposed, to, have, been, transported, to, lesbos, where, it, was, enshrined, and, visited, as, an, oracle, the, 2nd, century, geographer, pausanias, reported, that, the, bones, of, orpheus, were, kept, in, a, stone, vase, displayed, on, a, pillar, near, dion, his, place, of, death, and, a, major, religious, center, these, too, were, regarded, as, having, oracular, power, which, might, be, accessed, through, dreaming, in, a, ritual, of, incubation, the, accidental, exposure, of, the, bones, brought, a, disaster, upon, the, town, of, libretha, whence, the, people, of, dion, had, transferred, the, relics, to, their, own, keeping, according, to, the, chronicon, paschale, the, bones, of, the, persian, zoroaster, were, venerated, but, the, tradition, of, zoroastrianism, and, its, scriptures, offer, no, support, of, this, in, buddhism, relics, of, the, buddha, and, various, sages, are, venerated, after, the, buddha, s, death, his, remains, were, divided, into, eight, portions, afterward, these, relics, were, enshrined, in, stupas, wherever, buddhism, was, spread, some, relics, believed, to, be, original, remains, of, the, body, of, the, buddha, still, survive, including, the, relic, of, the, tooth, of, the, buddha, in, sri, lanka, a, stupa, is, a, building, created, specifically, for, the, relics, many, buddhist, temples, have, stupas, and, historically, the, placement, of, relics, in, a, stupa, often, became, the, initial, structure, around, which, the, whole, temple, would, be, based, today, many, stupas, also, hold, the, cremated, remains, or, ringsel, of, prominent, buddhists, in, rare, cases, the, whole, body, is, conserved, as, in, the, case, of, dudjom, rinpoche, a, year, after, his, death, in, 1987, his, physical, body, was, moved, from, france, and, placed, in, a, stupa, in, one, of, his, monasteries, near, boudhanath, nepal, pilgrims, may, view, his, body, through, a, glass, window, in, the, stupa, the, buddha, s, relics, are, used, to, show, people, that, enlightenment, is, possible, to, remind, them, that, the, buddha, was, a, real, person, and, to, also, promote, good, virtue, one, of, the, earliest, sources, that, purports, to, show, the, efficacy, of, relics, is, found, in, 2, kings, 13, 20, 21, and, elisha, died, and, they, buried, him, now, the, bands, of, the, moabites, used, to, invade, the, land, at, the, coming, in, of, the, year, and, it, came, to, pass, as, they, were, burying, a, man, that, behold, they, spied, a, band, and, they, cast, the, man, into, the, sepulchre, of, elisha, and, as, soon, as, the, man, touched, the, bones, of, elisha, he, revived, and, stood, up, on, his, feet, also, cited, is, the, veneration, of, relics, from, the, martyr, and, bishop, saint, polycarp, of, smyrna, recorded, in, the, martyrdom, of, polycarp, written, sometime, from, 150, to, 160, ad, with, regard, to, relics, that, are, objects, an, often, cited, passage, is, acts, 19, 11, 12, which, says, that, paul, the, apostle, s, handkerchiefs, were, imbued, by, god, with, healing, power, in, the, gospel, accounts, of, jesus, healing, the, bleeding, woman, and, again, in, the, gospel, of, mark, 6, 56, those, who, touched, jesus, garment, were, healed, the, practice, of, venerating, relics, seems, to, have, been, taken, for, granted, by, writers, like, augustine, st, ambrose, gregory, of, nyssa, st, chrysostom, and, st, gregory, nazianzen, dom, bernardo, cignitti, o, s, b, wrote, he, remains, of, certain, dead, are, surrounded, with, special, care, and, veneration, this, is, because, the, mortal, remains, of, the, deceased, are, associated, in, some, manner, with, the, holiness, of, their, souls, which, await, reunion, with, their, bodies, in, the, resurrection, thomas, aquinas, d, 1274, pointed, out, that, it, was, natural, that, people, should, treasure, what, is, associated, with, the, dead, much, like, the, personal, effects, of, a, relative, in, an, interview, with, catholic, news, service, fr, mario, conte, executive, editor, of, the, messenger, of, st, anthony, magazine, in, padua, italy, said, saints, relics, help, people, overcome, the, abstract, and, make, a, connection, with, the, holy, saints, do, not, perform, miracles, only, god, performs, miracles, but, saints, are, intercessors, in, the, early, church, the, disturbance, of, the, remains, of, martyrs, and, other, saints, was, not, practiced, they, were, allowed, to, remain, in, their, often, unidentified, resting, places, such, as, in, cemeteries, and, the, catacombs, of, rome, these, places, were, always, outside, the, walls, of, the, city, but, martyriums, began, to, be, built, over, the, site, of, the, burial, since, it, was, considered, beneficial, to, the, soul, to, be, buried, close, to, the, remains, of, saints, several, large, funerary, halls, were, built, over, the, sites, of, martyr, s, graves, including, old, saint, peter, s, basilica, these, were, initially, not, regular, churches, but, covered, cemeteries, crammed, with, graves, wherein, was, celebrated, funerary, and, memorial, services, it, may, have, been, thought, that, when, the, souls, of, the, martyrs, went, to, heaven, on, resurrection, day, they, would, be, accompanied, by, those, interred, nearby, who, would, thus, gain, favour, with, god, some, early, christians, attributed, healing, powers, to, the, dust, from, graves, of, saints, including, gregory, of, tours, the, cult, of, martin, of, tours, was, very, popular, in, merovingian, gaul, and, centered, at, a, great, church, built, just, outside, the, walls, of, tours, when, saint, martin, died, on, november, 8, 397, at, a, village, halfway, between, tours, and, poitiers, the, inhabitants, of, these, cities, were, ready, to, fight, for, his, body, which, the, people, of, tours, managed, to, secure, by, stealth, tours, became, the, chief, point, of, christian, pilgrimage, in, gaul, a, place, for, the, healing, of, the, sick, gregory, of, tours, travelled, to, the, shrine, when, he, had, contracted, a, serious, illness, later, as, bishop, of, tours, gregory, wrote, extensively, about, miracles, attributed, to, the, intercession, of, st, martin, nestorian, christianity, utilized, the, han, n, a, mixture, made, with, the, dust, of, thomas, the, apostle, s, tomb, for, healing, within, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, it, is, consumed, by, a, couple, getting, married, in, the, mystery, of, crowning, the, second, council, of, nicaea, in, 787, drew, on, the, teaching, of, st, john, damascene, that, homage, or, respect, is, not, really, paid, to, an, inanimate, object, but, to, the, holy, person, the, veneration, of, a, holy, person, is, itself, honour, paid, to, god, the, council, decreed, that, every, altar, should, contain, a, relic, making, it, clear, that, this, was, already, the, norm, as, it, remains, to, the, present, day, in, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, the, veneration, of, the, relics, of, the, saints, reflects, a, belief, that, the, saints, in, heaven, intercede, for, those, on, earth, a, number, of, cures, and, miracles, have, been, attributed, to, relics, not, because, of, their, own, power, but, because, of, the, holiness, of, the, saint, they, represent, many, tales, of, miracles, and, other, marvels, were, attributed, to, relics, beginning, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, church, these, became, popular, during, the, middle, ages, they, were, collected, in, books, of, hagiography, such, as, the, golden, legend, or, the, works, of, caesarius, of, heisterbach, these, miracle, tales, made, relics, much, sought, after, during, the, period, by, the, late, middle, ages, the, collecting, of, and, dealing, in, relics, had, reached, enormous, proportions, and, had, spread, from, the, church, to, royalty, and, then, to, the, nobility, and, merchant, classes, the, council, of, trent, of, 1563, enjoined, bishops, to, instruct, their, flocks, that, the, holy, bodies, of, holy, martyrs, are, to, be, venerated, by, the, faithful, for, through, these, many, benefits, are, bestowed, by, god, on, men, the, council, further, insisted, that, in, the, invocation, of, saints, the, veneration, of, relics, and, the, sacred, use, of, images, every, superstition, shall, be, removed, and, all, filthy, lucre, abolished, there, are, also, many, relics, associated, with, jesus, in, his, introduction, to, gregory, s, history, of, the, franks, ernest, brehaut, analyzed, the, romano, christian, concepts, that, gave, relics, such, a, powerful, draw, he, distinguished, gregory, s, constant, usage, of, sanctus, and, virtus, the, first, with, its, familiar, meaning, of, sacred, or, holy, and, the, second, as, the, mystic, potency, emanating, from, the, person, or, thing, that, is, sacred, in, a, practical, way, the, second, word, describes, the, uncanny, mysterious, power, emanating, from, the, supernatural, and, affecting, the, natural, these, points, of, contact, and, yielding, are, the, miracles, we, continually, hear, of, rome, became, a, major, destination, for, christian, pilgrims, as, it, was, easier, to, access, for, european, pilgrims, than, the, holy, land, constantine, the, great, erected, great, basilicas, over, the, tombs, of, saints, peter, and, paul, a, distinction, of, these, sites, was, the, presence, of, holy, relics, over, the, course, of, the, middle, ages, other, religious, structures, acquired, relics, and, became, destinations, for, pilgrimage, in, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, centuries, substantial, numbers, of, pilgrims, flocked, to, santiago, de, compostela, in, spain, in, which, the, supposed, relics, of, the, apostle, james, son, of, zebedee, discovered, c, 830, are, housed, santiago, de, compostela, remains, a, significant, pilgrimage, site, with, around, 200, 000, pilgrims, both, secular, and, christian, completing, the, numerous, pilgrimage, routes, to, the, cathedral, in, 2012, alone, by, venerating, relics, through, visitation, gifts, and, providing, services, medieval, christians, believed, that, they, would, acquire, the, protection, and, intercession, of, the, sanctified, dead, relics, of, local, saints, drew, visitors, to, sites, like, saint, frideswide, s, in, oxford, and, san, nicola, peregrino, in, trani, instead, of, having, to, travel, to, be, near, to, a, venerated, saint, relics, of, the, saint, could, be, venerated, locally, believers, would, make, pilgrimages, to, places, believed, to, have, been, sanctified, by, the, physical, presence, of, christ, or, prominent, saints, such, as, the, site, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, as, holy, relics, attracted, pilgrims, and, these, religious, tourists, needed, to, be, housed, fed, and, provided, with, souvenirs, relics, became, a, source, of, income, not, only, for, the, destinations, that, held, them, but, for, the, abbeys, churches, and, towns, en, route, relics, were, prized, as, they, were, portable, they, could, be, possessed, inventoried, bequeathed, stolen, counterfeited, and, smuggled, they, could, add, value, to, an, established, site, or, confer, significance, on, a, new, location, offerings, made, at, a, site, of, pilgrimage, were, an, important, source, of, revenue, for, the, community, who, received, them, on, behalf, of, the, saint, according, to, patrick, geary, o, the, communities, fortunate, enough, to, have, a, saint, s, remains, in, its, church, the, benefits, in, terms, of, revenue, and, status, were, enormous, and, competition, to, acquire, relics, and, to, promote, the, local, saint, s, virtues, over, those, of, neighboring, communities, was, keen, local, clergy, promoted, their, own, patron, saints, in, an, effort, to, secure, their, own, market, share, on, occasion, guards, had, to, watch, over, mortally, ill, holy, men, and, women, to, prevent, the, unauthorized, dismemberment, of, their, corpses, as, soon, as, they, died, geary, also, suggests, that, the, danger, of, someone, murdering, an, aging, holy, man, in, order, to, acquire, his, relics, was, a, legitimate, concern, relics, were, used, to, cure, the, sick, to, seek, intercession, for, relief, from, famine, or, plague, to, take, solemn, oaths, and, to, pressure, warring, factions, to, make, peace, in, the, presence, of, the, sacred, courts, held, relics, since, merovingian, times, st, angilbert, acquired, for, charlemagne, one, of, the, most, impressive, collections, in, christendom, an, active, market, developed, and, relics, entered, into, commerce, along, the, same, trade, routes, followed, by, other, portable, commodities, matthew, brown, likens, a, ninth, century, italian, deacon, named, deusdona, with, access, to, the, roman, catacombs, as, crossing, the, alps, to, visit, monastic, fairs, of, northern, europe, much, like, a, contemporary, art, dealer, canterbury, was, a, popular, destination, for, english, pilgrims, who, traveled, to, witness, the, miracle, working, relics, of, st, thomas, becket, the, sainted, archbishop, of, canterbury, who, was, assassinated, by, knights, of, king, henry, ii, in, 1170, after, becket, s, death, his, successor, and, the, canterbury, chapter, quickly, used, his, relics, to, promote, the, cult, of, the, as, yet, uncanonized, martyr, the, motivations, included, the, assertion, of, the, church, s, independence, against, rulers, a, desire, to, have, an, english, indeed, norman, english, saint, of, european, reputation, and, the, desire, to, promote, canterbury, as, a, destination, for, pilgrimage, in, the, first, years, after, becket, s, death, donations, at, the, shrine, accounted, for, twenty, eight, percent, of, the, cathedral, s, total, revenues, in, the, absence, of, real, ways, of, assessing, authenticity, relic, collectors, became, prey, to, the, unscrupulous, and, some, extremely, high, prices, were, paid, forgeries, proliferated, from, the, very, beginning, augustine, already, denounced, impostors, who, wandered, around, disguised, as, monks, making, a, profit, from, the, sale, of, spurious, relics, in, his, admonitio, generalis, of, 789, charlemagne, ordered, that, the, false, names, of, martyrs, and, the, uncertain, memorials, of, saints, should, not, be, venerated, the, fourth, lateran, council, 1215, of, the, catholic, church, condemned, abuses, such, as, counterfeit, relics, and, exaggerated, claims, pieces, of, the, true, cross, were, one, of, the, most, highly, sought, after, of, such, relics, many, churches, claimed, to, possess, a, piece, of, it, so, many, that, john, calvin, famously, remarked, that, there, were, enough, pieces, of, the, true, cross, to, build, a, ship, from, a, study, in, 1870, found, that, put, together, the, claimed, relics, of, the, cross, at, that, much, later, time, weighed, less, than, 1, 7, kg, by, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, the, number, of, relics, in, christian, churches, became, enormous, and, there, was, practically, no, possibility, to, distinguish, the, authentic, from, the, falsification, since, both, of, them, had, been, in, the, temples, for, centuries, and, were, objects, for, worship, in, 1543, john, calvin, wrote, about, fake, relics, in, his, treatise, on, relics, in, which, he, described, the, state, of, affairs, with, relics, in, catholic, churches, calvin, says, that, the, saints, have, two, or, three, or, more, bodies, with, arms, and, legs, and, even, a, few, extra, limbs, and, heads, due, to, the, existence, of, counterfeit, relics, the, church, began, to, regulate, the, use, of, relics, canon, law, required, the, authentication, of, relics, if, they, were, to, be, publicly, venerated, they, had, to, be, sealed, in, a, reliquary, and, accompanied, by, a, certificate, of, authentication, signed, and, sealed, by, someone, in, the, congregation, for, saints, or, by, the, local, bishop, where, the, saint, lived, without, such, authentication, relics, are, not, to, be, used, for, public, veneration, the, congregation, for, saints, as, part, of, the, roman, curia, holds, the, authority, to, verify, relics, in, which, documentation, is, lost, or, missing, the, documents, and, reliquaries, of, authenticated, relics, are, usually, affixed, with, a, wax, seal, in, catholic, theology, sacred, relics, must, not, be, worshipped, because, only, god, is, worshipped, and, adored, instead, the, veneration, given, to, them, was, dulia, saint, jerome, declared, we, do, not, worship, we, do, not, adore, for, fear, that, we, should, bow, down, to, the, creature, rather, than, to, the, creator, but, we, venerate, the, relics, of, the, martyrs, in, order, the, better, to, adore, him, whose, martyrs, they, are, until, 2017, the, catholic, church, divided, relics, into, three, classes, in, 2017, the, congregation, for, the, causes, of, saints, abolished, the, relics, of, the, third, degree, introducing, a, two, stage, scale, of, classification, of, relics, significant, insigni, and, non, significant, non, insigni, relics, the, first, are, the, bodies, or, their, significant, parts, as, well, as, the, entire, contents, of, the, urn, with, the, ashes, preserved, after, cremation, the, second, includes, small, fragments, of, the, bodies, as, well, as, objects, used, by, saints, and, blesseds, the, sale, or, disposal, by, other, means, of, sacred, relics, meaning, first, and, second, class, without, the, permission, of, the, apostolic, see, is, now, strictly, forbidden, by, canon, 1190, of, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, however, the, catholic, church, permitted, the, sale, of, third, class, relics, relics, may, not, be, placed, upon, the, altar, for, public, veneration, as, that, is, reserved, for, the, display, of, the, blessed, sacrament, host, or, prosphora, and, eucharistic, wine, after, consecration, in, the, sacrament, of, the, eucharist, the, importance, of, relics, in, the, byzantine, world, can, be, seen, from, the, veneration, given, to, the, pieces, of, the, true, cross, many, great, works, of, byzantine, enamel, are, staurothekes, or, relics, containing, fragments, of, the, true, cross, other, significant, relics, included, the, girdle, worn, by, the, virgin, and, pieces, of, the, body, or, clothing, of, saints, such, relics, called, contact, relics, or, secondary, relics, were, however, scarce, and, did, not, provide, most, believers, with, ready, access, to, proximity, to, the, holy, the, growth, in, the, production, and, popularity, of, reproducible, contact, relics, in, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, testifies, to, the, need, felt, for, more, widespread, access, to, the, divine, these, contact, relics, usually, involved, the, placing, of, readily, available, objects, such, as, pieces, of, cloth, clay, tablets, or, water, then, bottled, for, believers, in, contact, with, a, relic, alternatively, such, objects, could, be, dipped, into, water, which, had, been, in, contact, with, the, relic, such, as, the, bone, of, a, saint, these, relics, a, firmly, embedded, part, of, veneration, by, this, period, increased, the, availability, of, access, to, the, divine, but, were, not, infinitely, reproducible, an, original, relic, was, required, and, still, usually, required, believers, to, undertake, pilgrimage, or, have, contact, with, somebody, who, had, the, earliest, recorded, removal, or, translation, of, saintly, remains, was, that, of, saint, babylas, at, antioch, in, 354, but, partly, perhaps, because, constantinople, lacked, the, many, saintly, graves, of, rome, they, soon, became, common, in, the, eastern, empire, though, still, prohibited, in, the, west, the, eastern, capital, was, therefore, able, to, acquire, the, remains, of, saints, timothy, andrew, and, luke, and, the, division, of, bodies, also, began, the, 5th, century, theologian, theodoretus, declaring, that, grace, remains, entire, with, every, part, in, the, west, a, decree, of, theodosius, only, allowed, the, moving, of, a, whole, sarcophagus, with, its, contents, but, the, upheavals, of, the, barbarian, invasions, relaxed, the, rules, as, remains, needed, to, be, relocated, to, safer, places, the, veneration, of, relics, continues, to, be, of, importance, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, as, a, natural, outgrowth, of, the, concept, in, orthodox, theology, of, theosis, the, physical, bodies, of, the, saints, are, considered, to, be, transformed, by, divine, grace, indeed, all, orthodox, christians, are, considered, to, be, sanctified, by, living, the, mystical, life, of, the, church, and, especially, by, receiving, the, sacred, mysteries, sacraments, in, the, orthodox, service, books, the, remains, of, the, departed, faithful, are, referred, to, as, relics, and, are, treated, with, honour, and, respect, for, this, reason, the, bodies, of, orthodox, christians, are, traditionally, not, embalmed, the, veneration, of, the, relics, of, the, saints, is, of, great, importance, in, orthodoxy, and, very, often, churches, will, display, the, relics, of, saints, prominently, in, a, number, of, monasteries, particularly, those, on, the, semi, autonomous, mount, athos, in, greece, all, of, the, relics, the, monastery, possesses, are, displayed, and, venerated, each, evening, at, compline, as, with, the, veneration, of, icons, the, veneration, greek, dulia, of, relics, in, the, orthodox, church, is, clearly, distinguished, from, adoration, latria, i, e, that, worship, which, is, due, to, god, alone, thus, orthodox, teaching, warns, the, faithful, against, idolatry, and, at, the, same, time, remains, true, to, scriptural, teaching, vis, 2, kings, 13, 20, 21, as, understood, by, orthodox, sacred, tradition, the, examination, of, the, relics, is, an, important, step, in, the, glorification, canonization, of, new, saints, sometimes, one, of, the, signs, of, sanctification, is, the, condition, of, the, relics, of, the, saint, some, saints, will, be, incorrupt, meaning, that, their, remains, do, not, decay, under, conditions, when, they, normally, would, natural, mummification, is, not, the, same, as, incorruption, sometimes, even, when, the, flesh, does, decay, the, bones, themselves, will, manifest, signs, of, sanctity, they, may, be, honey, coloured, or, give, off, a, sweet, aroma, some, relics, will, exude, myrrh, the, absence, of, such, manifestations, is, not, necessarily, a, sign, that, the, person, is, not, a, saint,

absence, of, relics, in, islam, it, is, however, evident, that, the, historical, reality, of, relics, in, islam, was, very, different, and, that, the, classical, islamic, thinkers, posed, various, reasons, for, why, the, veneration, of, the, relics, of, prophets, and, saints, was, permissible, while, various, relics, are, preserved, by, different, muslim, communities, the, most, important, are, those, known, as, the, sacred, trusts, more, than, 600, pieces, treasured, in, the, privy, chamber, of, the, topkap, palace, museum, in, istanbul, muslims, believe, that, these, treasures, include,
