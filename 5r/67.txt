skepticism, also, spelled, scepticism, in, british, english, is, a, questioning, attitude, or, doubt, toward, knowledge, claims, that, are, seen, as, mere, belief, or, dogma, for, example, if, a, person, is, skeptical, about, claims, made, by, their, government, about, an, ongoing, war, then, the, person, doubts, that, these, claims, are, accurate, in, such, cases, skeptics, normally, recommend, not, disbelief, but, suspension, of, belief, i, e, maintaining, a, neutral, attitude, that, neither, affirms, nor, denies, the, claim, this, attitude, is, often, motivated, by, the, impression, that, the, available, evidence, is, insufficient, to, support, the, claim, formally, skepticism, is, a, topic, of, interest, in, philosophy, particularly, epistemology, more, informally, skepticism, as, an, expression, of, questioning, or, doubt, can, be, applied, to, any, topic, such, as, politics, religion, or, pseudoscience, it, is, often, applied, within, restricted, domains, such, as, morality, moral, skepticism, atheism, skepticism, about, the, existence, of, god, or, the, supernatural, some, theorists, distinguish, good, or, moderate, skepticism, which, seeks, strong, evidence, before, accepting, a, position, from, bad, or, radical, skepticism, which, wants, to, suspend, judgment, indefinitely, philosophical, skepticism, is, one, important, form, of, skepticism, it, rejects, knowledge, claims, that, seem, certain, from, the, perspective, of, common, sense, radical, forms, of, philosophical, skepticism, deny, that, knowledge, or, rational, belief, is, possible, and, urge, us, to, suspend, judgment, on, many, or, all, controversial, matters, more, moderate, forms, claim, only, that, nothing, can, be, known, with, certainty, or, that, we, can, know, little, or, nothing, about, nonempirical, matters, such, as, whether, god, exists, whether, human, beings, have, free, will, or, whether, there, is, an, afterlife, in, ancient, philosophy, skepticism, was, understood, as, a, way, of, life, associated, with, inner, peace, skepticism, has, been, responsible, for, many, important, developments, in, science, and, philosophy, it, has, also, inspired, several, contemporary, social, movements, religious, skepticism, advocates, for, doubt, concerning, basic, religious, principles, such, as, immortality, providence, and, revelation, scientific, skepticism, advocates, for, testing, beliefs, for, reliability, by, subjecting, them, to, systematic, investigation, using, the, scientific, method, to, discover, empirical, evidence, for, them, skepticism, also, spelled, scepticism, from, the, greek, skeptomai, to, search, to, think, about, or, look, for, refers, to, a, doubting, attitude, toward, knowledge, claims, so, if, a, person, is, skeptical, of, their, government, s, claims, about, an, ongoing, war, then, the, person, has, doubts, that, these, claims, are, true, or, being, skeptical, that, one, s, favorite, hockey, team, will, win, the, championship, means, that, one, is, uncertain, about, the, strength, of, their, performance, skepticism, about, a, claim, implies, that, one, does, not, believe, the, claim, to, be, true, but, it, does, not, automatically, follow, that, one, should, believe, that, the, claim, is, false, either, instead, skeptics, usually, recommend, a, neutral, attitude, beliefs, about, this, matter, should, be, suspended, in, this, regard, skepticism, about, a, claim, can, be, defined, as, the, thesis, that, the, only, justified, attitude, with, respect, to, is, suspension, of, judgment, it, is, often, motivated, by, the, impression, that, one, cannot, be, certain, about, it, this, is, especially, relevant, when, there, is, significant, expert, disagreement, skepticism, is, usually, restricted, to, a, claim, or, a, field, of, inquiry, so, religious, and, moral, skeptics, have, a, doubtful, attitude, about, religious, and, moral, doctrines, but, some, forms, of, philosophical, skepticism, are, wider, in, that, they, reject, any, form, of, knowledge, some, definitions, often, inspired, by, ancient, philosophy, see, skepticism, not, just, as, an, attitude, but, as, a, way, of, life, this, is, based, on, the, idea, that, maintaining, the, skeptical, attitude, of, doubt, toward, most, concerns, in, life, is, superior, to, living, in, dogmatic, certainty, for, example, because, such, a, skeptic, has, more, happiness, and, peace, of, mind, or, because, it, is, morally, better, in, contemporary, philosophy, on, the, other, hand, skepticism, is, often, understood, neither, as, an, attitude, nor, as, a, way, of, life, but, as, a, thesis, the, thesis, that, knowledge, does, not, exist, skepticism, is, related, to, various, terms, it, is, sometimes, equated, with, agnosticism, and, relativism, however, there, are, slight, differences, in, meaning, agnosticism, is, often, understood, more, narrowly, as, skepticism, about, religious, questions, in, particular, about, the, christian, doctrine, relativism, does, not, deny, the, existence, of, knowledge, or, truth, but, holds, that, they, are, relative, to, a, person, and, differ, from, person, to, person, for, example, because, they, follow, different, cognitive, norms, the, opposite, of, skepticism, is, dogmatism, which, implies, an, attitude, of, certainty, in, the, form, of, an, unquestioning, belief, a, similar, contrast, is, often, drawn, in, relation, to, blind, faith, and, credulity, various, types, of, skepticism, have, been, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, skepticism, is, usually, restricted, to, knowledge, claims, on, one, particular, subject, which, is, why, its, different, forms, can, be, distinguished, based, on, the, subject, for, example, religious, skeptics, distrust, religious, doctrines, and, moral, skeptics, raise, doubts, about, accepting, various, moral, requirements, and, customs, skepticism, can, also, be, applied, to, knowledge, in, general, however, this, attitude, is, usually, only, found, in, some, forms, of, philosophical, skepticism, a, closely, related, classification, distinguishes, based, on, the, source, of, knowledge, such, as, skepticism, about, perception, memory, or, intuition, a, further, distinction, is, based, on, the, degree, of, the, skeptical, attitude, the, strongest, forms, assert, that, there, is, no, knowledge, at, all, or, that, knowledge, is, impossible, weaker, forms, merely, state, that, one, can, never, be, absolutely, certain, some, theorists, distinguish, between, a, good, or, healthy, form, of, moderate, skepticism, in, contrast, to, a, bad, or, unhealthy, form, of, radical, skepticism, on, this, view, the, good, skeptic, is, a, critically, minded, person, who, seeks, strong, evidence, before, accepting, a, position, the, bad, skeptic, on, the, other, hand, wants, to, suspend, judgment, indefinitely, even, in, the, face, of, demonstrable, truth, another, categorization, focuses, on, the, motivation, for, the, skeptical, attitude, some, skeptics, have, ideological, motives, they, want, to, replace, inferior, beliefs, with, better, ones, others, have, a, more, practical, outlook, in, that, they, see, problematic, beliefs, as, the, cause, of, harmful, customs, they, wish, to, stop, some, skeptics, have, very, particular, goals, in, mind, such, as, bringing, down, a, certain, institution, associated, with, the, spread, of, claims, they, reject, philosophical, skepticism, is, a, prominent, form, of, skepticism, and, can, be, contrasted, with, non, philosophical, or, ordinary, skepticism, ordinary, skepticism, involves, a, doubting, attitude, toward, knowledge, claims, that, are, rejected, by, many, almost, everyone, shows, some, form, of, ordinary, skepticism, for, example, by, doubting, the, knowledge, claims, made, by, flat, earthers, or, astrologers, philosophical, skepticism, on, the, other, hand, is, a, much, more, radical, and, rare, position, it, includes, the, rejection, of, knowledge, claims, that, seem, certain, from, the, perspective, of, common, sense, some, forms, of, it, even, deny, that, one, knows, that, i, have, two, hands, or, that, the, sun, will, come, out, tomorrow, it, is, taken, seriously, in, philosophy, nonetheless, because, it, has, proven, very, hard, to, conclusively, refute, philosophical, skepticism, skepticism, has, been, responsible, for, important, developments, in, various, fields, such, as, science, medicine, and, philosophy, in, science, the, skeptical, attitude, toward, traditional, opinions, was, a, key, factor, in, the, development, of, the, scientific, method, it, emphasizes, the, need, to, scrutinize, knowledge, claims, by, testing, them, through, experimentation, and, precise, measurement, in, the, field, of, medicine, skepticism, has, helped, establish, more, advanced, forms, of, treatment, by, putting, into, doubt, traditional, forms, that, were, based, on, intuitive, appeal, rather, than, empirical, evidence, in, the, history, of, philosophy, skepticism, has, often, played, a, productive, role, not, just, for, skeptics, but, also, for, non, skeptical, philosophers, this, is, due, to, its, critical, attitude, that, challenges, the, epistemological, foundations, of, philosophical, theories, this, can, help, to, keep, speculation, in, check, and, may, provoke, creative, responses, transforming, the, theory, in, question, in, order, to, overcome, the, problems, posed, by, skepticism, according, to, richard, h, popkin, the, history, of, philosophy, can, be, seen, in, part, as, a, struggle, with, skepticism, this, struggle, has, led, many, contemporary, philosophers, to, abandon, the, quest, for, absolutely, certain, or, indubitable, first, principles, of, philosophy, which, was, still, prevalent, in, many, earlier, periods, skepticism, has, been, an, important, topic, throughout, the, history, of, philosophy, and, is, still, widely, discussed, today, as, a, philosophical, school, or, movement, skepticism, arose, both, in, ancient, greece, and, india, in, india, the, aj, ana, school, of, philosophy, espoused, skepticism, it, was, a, major, early, rival, of, buddhism, and, jainism, and, possibly, a, major, influence, on, buddhism, two, of, the, foremost, disciples, of, the, buddha, sariputta, and, moggall, na, were, initially, students, of, the, aj, ana, philosopher, sanjaya, belatthiputta, a, strong, element, of, skepticism, is, found, in, early, buddhism, most, particularly, in, the, a, hakavagga, sutra, however, the, total, effect, these, philosophies, had, on, each, other, is, difficult, to, discern, since, skepticism, is, a, philosophical, attitude, and, a, style, of, philosophizing, rather, than, a, position, the, aj, anins, may, have, influenced, other, skeptical, thinkers, of, india, such, as, nagarjuna, jayar, i, bha, a, and, shriharsha, in, greece, philosophers, as, early, as, xenophanes, c, 570, c, 475, bce, expressed, skeptical, views, as, did, democritus, and, a, number, of, sophists, gorgias, for, example, reputedly, argued, that, nothing, exists, that, even, if, there, were, something, we, could, not, know, it, and, that, even, if, we, could, know, it, we, could, not, communicate, it, the, heraclitean, philosopher, cratylus, refused, to, discuss, anything, and, would, merely, wriggle, his, finger, claiming, that, communication, is, impossible, since, meanings, are, constantly, changing, 449, socrates, also, had, skeptical, tendencies, claiming, to, know, nothing, worthwhile, there, were, two, major, schools, of, skepticism, in, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, world, the, first, was, pyrrhonism, founded, by, pyrrho, of, elis, c, 360, 270, bce, the, second, was, academic, skepticism, so, called, because, its, two, leading, defenders, arcesilaus, c, 315, 240, bce, who, initiated, the, philosophy, and, carneades, c, 217, 128, bce, the, philosophy, s, most, famous, proponent, were, heads, of, plato, s, academy, pyrrhonism, s, aims, are, psychological, it, urges, suspension, of, judgment, epoche, to, achieve, mental, tranquility, ataraxia, the, academic, skeptics, denied, that, knowledge, is, possible, acatalepsy, the, academic, skeptics, claimed, that, some, beliefs, are, more, reasonable, or, probable, than, others, whereas, pyrrhonian, skeptics, argue, that, equally, compelling, arguments, can, be, given, for, or, against, any, disputed, view, 450, nearly, all, the, writings, of, the, ancient, skeptics, are, now, lost, most, of, what, we, know, about, ancient, skepticism, is, from, sextus, empiricus, a, pyrrhonian, skeptic, who, lived, in, the, second, or, third, century, ce, his, works, contain, a, lucid, summary, of, stock, skeptical, arguments, ancient, skepticism, faded, out, during, the, late, roman, empire, particularly, after, augustine, 354, 430, ce, attacked, the, skeptics, in, his, work, against, the, academics, 386, ce, there, was, little, knowledge, of, or, interest, in, ancient, skepticism, in, christian, europe, during, the, middle, ages, interest, revived, during, the, renaissance, and, reformation, particularly, after, the, complete, writings, of, sextus, empiricus, were, translated, into, latin, in, 1569, and, after, martin, luther, s, skepticism, of, holy, orders, a, number, of, catholic, writers, including, francisco, sanches, c, 1550, 1623, michel, de, montaigne, 1533, 1592, pierre, gassendi, 1592, 1655, and, marin, mersenne, 1588, 1648, deployed, ancient, skeptical, arguments, to, defend, moderate, forms, of, skepticism, and, to, argue, that, faith, rather, than, reason, must, be, the, primary, guide, to, truth, similar, arguments, were, offered, later, perhaps, ironically, by, the, protestant, thinker, pierre, bayle, in, his, influential, historical, and, critical, dictionary, 1697, 1702, chaps, 1, 2, the, growing, popularity, of, skeptical, views, created, an, intellectual, crisis, in, seventeenth, century, europe, an, influential, response, was, offered, by, the, french, philosopher, and, mathematician, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, in, his, classic, work, meditations, of, first, philosophy, 1641, descartes, sought, to, refute, skepticism, but, only, after, he, had, formulated, the, case, for, skepticism, as, powerfully, as, possible, descartes, argued, that, no, matter, what, radical, skeptical, possibilities, we, imagine, there, are, certain, truths, e, g, that, thinking, is, occurring, or, that, i, exist, that, are, absolutely, certain, thus, the, ancient, skeptics, were, wrong, to, claim, that, knowledge, is, impossible, descartes, also, attempted, to, refute, skeptical, doubts, about, the, reliability, of, our, senses, our, memory, and, other, cognitive, faculties, to, do, this, descartes, tried, to, prove, that, god, exists, and, that, god, would, not, allow, us, to, be, systematically, deceived, about, the, nature, of, reality, many, contemporary, philosophers, question, whether, this, second, stage, of, descartes, s, critique, of, skepticism, is, successful, 210, in, the, eighteenth, century, a, new, case, for, skepticism, was, offered, by, the, scottish, philosopher, david, hume, 1711, 1776, hume, was, an, empiricist, claiming, that, all, genuine, ideas, can, be, traced, back, to, original, impressions, of, sensation, or, introspective, consciousness, hume, argued, that, on, empiricist, grounds, there, are, no, sound, reasons, for, belief, in, god, an, enduring, self, or, soul, an, external, world, causal, necessity, objective, morality, or, inductive, reasoning, in, fact, he, argued, that, philosophy, would, render, us, entirely, pyrrhonian, were, not, nature, too, strong, for, it, 456, as, hume, saw, it, the, real, basis, of, human, belief, is, not, reason, but, custom, or, habit, we, are, hard, wired, by, nature, to, trust, say, our, memories, or, inductive, reasoning, and, no, skeptical, arguments, however, powerful, can, dislodge, those, beliefs, in, this, way, hume, embraced, what, he, called, a, mitigated, skepticism, while, rejecting, an, excessive, pyrrhonian, skepticism, that, he, saw, as, both, impractical, and, psychologically, impossible, hume, s, skepticism, provoked, a, number, of, important, responses, hume, s, scottish, contemporary, thomas, reid, 1710, 1796, challenged, hume, s, strict, empiricism, and, argued, that, it, is, rational, to, accept, common, sense, beliefs, such, as, the, basic, reliability, of, our, senses, our, reason, our, memories, and, inductive, reasoning, even, though, none, of, these, things, can, be, proved, in, reid, s, view, such, common, sense, beliefs, are, foundational, and, require, no, proof, in, order, to, be, rationally, justified, 456, not, long, after, hume, s, death, the, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, argued, that, human, empirical, experience, has, possibility, conditions, which, could, not, have, been, realized, unless, hume, s, skeptical, conclusions, about, causal, synthetic, a, priori, judgements, were, false, today, skepticism, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, lively, debate, among, philosophers, british, philosopher, julian, baggini, posits, that, reason, is, perceived, as, an, enemy, of, mystery, and, ambiguity, but, if, used, properly, can, be, an, effective, tool, for, solving, many, larger, societal, issues, religious, skepticism, generally, refers, to, doubting, particular, religious, beliefs, or, claims, for, example, a, religious, skeptic, might, believe, that, jesus, existed, see, historicity, of, jesus, while, questioning, claims, that, he, was, the, messiah, or, performed, miracles, historically, religious, skepticism, can, be, traced, back, to, xenophanes, who, doubted, many, religious, claims, of, his, time, although, he, recognized, that, god, is, one, supreme, among, gods, and, men, and, not, like, mortals, in, body, or, in, mind, he, maintained, that, there, was, one, greatest, god, god, is, one, eternal, being, spherical, in, form, comprehending, all, things, within, himself, is, the, absolute, mind, and, thought, therefore, is, intelligent, and, moves, all, things, but, bears, no, resemblance, to, human, nature, either, in, body, or, mind, religious, skepticism, is, not, the, same, as, atheism, or, agnosticism, though, these, often, do, involve, skeptical, attitudes, toward, religion, and, philosophical, theology, for, example, towards, divine, omnipotence, religious, people, are, generally, skeptical, about, claims, of, other, religions, at, least, when, the, two, denominations, conflict, concerning, some, belief, additionally, they, may, also, be, skeptical, of, the, claims, made, by, atheists, the, historian, will, durant, writes, that, plato, was, as, skeptical, of, atheism, as, of, any, other, dogma, the, bah, faith, encourages, skepticism, that, is, mainly, centered, around, self, investigation, of, truth, a, scientific, or, empirical, skeptic, is, one, who, questions, beliefs, on, the, basis, of, scientific, understanding, and, empirical, evidence, scientific, skepticism, may, discard, beliefs, pertaining, to, purported, phenomena, not, subject, to, reliable, observation, and, thus, not, systematic, or, empirically, testable, most, scientists, being, scientific, skeptics, test, the, reliability, of, certain, kinds, of, claims, by, subjecting, them, to, systematic, investigation, via, the, scientific, method, as, a, result, a, number, of, ostensibly, scientific, claims, are, considered, to, be, pseudoscience, if, they, are, found, to, improperly, apply, or, to, ignore, the, fundamental, aspects, of, the, scientific, method, professional, skepticism, is, an, important, concept, in, auditing, it, requires, an, auditor, to, have, a, questioning, mind, to, make, a, critical, assessment, of, evidence, and, to, consider, the, sufficiency, of, the, evidence
