the, unicorn, is, a, legendary, creature, that, has, been, described, since, antiquity, as, a, beast, with, a, single, large, pointed, spiraling, horn, projecting, from, its, forehead, in, european, literature, and, art, the, unicorn, has, for, the, last, thousand, years, or, so, been, depicted, as, a, white, horse, or, goat, like, animal, with, a, long, straight, horn, with, spiralling, grooves, cloven, hooves, and, sometimes, a, goat, s, beard, in, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, it, was, commonly, described, as, an, extremely, wild, woodland, creature, a, symbol, of, purity, and, grace, which, could, be, captured, only, by, a, virgin, in, encyclopedias, its, horn, was, described, as, having, the, power, to, render, poisoned, water, potable, and, to, heal, sickness, in, medieval, and, renaissance, times, the, tusk, of, the, narwhal, was, sometimes, sold, as, a, unicorn, horn, a, bovine, type, of, unicorn, is, thought, by, some, scholars, to, have, been, depicted, in, seals, of, the, bronze, age, indus, valley, civilization, the, interpretation, remaining, controversial, an, equine, form, of, the, unicorn, was, mentioned, by, the, ancient, greeks, in, accounts, of, natural, history, by, various, writers, including, ctesias, strabo, pliny, the, younger, aelian, and, cosmas, indicopleustes, the, bible, also, describes, an, animal, the, re, em, which, some, translations, render, as, unicorn, the, unicorn, continues, to, hold, a, place, in, popular, culture, it, is, often, used, as, a, symbol, of, fantasy, or, rarity, in, the, 21st, century, it, has, become, an, lgbt, symbol, a, creature, with, a, single, horn, conventionally, called, a, unicorn, is, the, most, common, image, on, the, soapstone, stamp, seals, of, the, bronze, age, indus, valley, civilization, ivc, from, the, centuries, around, 2000, bc, it, has, a, body, more, like, a, cow, than, a, horse, and, a, curved, horn, that, goes, forward, then, up, at, the, tip, the, mysterious, feature, depicted, coming, down, from, the, front, of, the, back, is, usually, shown, it, may, represent, a, harness, or, other, covering, typically, the, unicorn, faces, a, vertical, object, with, at, least, two, stages, this, is, variously, described, as, a, ritual, offering, stand, an, incense, burner, or, a, manger, the, animal, is, always, in, profile, on, indus, seals, but, the, theory, that, it, represents, animals, with, two, horns, one, hiding, the, other, is, disproved, by, a, much, smaller, number, of, small, terracotta, unicorns, probably, toys, and, the, profile, depictions, of, bulls, where, both, horns, are, clearly, shown, it, is, thought, that, the, unicorn, was, the, symbol, of, a, powerful, clan, or, merchant, community, but, may, also, have, had, some, religious, significance, in, south, asia, the, unicorn, is, only, seen, during, the, ivc, period, and, disappeared, in, south, asian, art, after, this, jonathan, mark, kenoyer, stated, the, ivc, unicorn, has, no, direct, connection, with, later, unicorn, motifs, observed, in, other, parts, of, the, world, nonetheless, it, remains, possible, that, the, ivc, unicorn, had, contributed, to, later, myths, of, fantastical, one, horned, creatures, in, west, asia, unicorns, are, not, found, in, greek, mythology, but, rather, in, the, accounts, of, natural, history, for, greek, writers, of, natural, history, were, convinced, of, the, reality, of, unicorns, which, they, believed, lived, in, india, a, distant, and, fabulous, realm, for, them, the, earliest, description, is, from, ctesias, who, in, his, book, indika, on, india, described, them, as, wild, asses, fleet, of, foot, having, a, horn, a, cubit, and, a, half, 700, mm, 28, inches, in, length, and, colored, white, red, and, black, unicorn, meat, was, said, to, be, too, bitter, to, eat, ctesias, got, his, information, while, living, in, persia, unicorns, or, more, likely, winged, bulls, appear, in, reliefs, at, the, ancient, persian, capital, of, persepolis, in, iran, aristotle, must, be, following, ctesias, when, he, mentions, two, one, horned, animals, the, oryx, a, kind, of, antelope, and, the, so, called, indian, ass, antigonus, of, carystus, also, wrote, about, the, one, horned, indian, ass, strabo, says, that, in, the, caucasus, there, were, one, horned, horses, with, stag, like, heads, pliny, the, elder, mentions, the, oryx, and, an, indian, ox, perhaps, a, greater, one, horned, rhinoceros, as, one, horned, beasts, as, well, as, a, very, fierce, animal, called, the, monoceros, which, has, the, head, of, the, stag, the, feet, of, the, elephant, and, the, tail, of, the, boar, while, the, rest, of, the, body, is, like, that, of, the, horse, it, makes, a, deep, lowing, noise, and, has, a, single, black, horn, which, projects, from, the, middle, of, its, forehead, two, cubits, in, length, in, on, the, nature, of, animals, de, natura, animalium, aelian, quoting, ctesias, adds, that, india, produces, also, a, one, horned, horse, iii, 41, iv, 52, and, says, xvi, 20, that, the, monoceros, was, sometimes, called, cartazonos, which, may, be, a, form, of, the, arabic, karkadann, meaning, rhinoceros, cosmas, indicopleustes, a, merchant, of, alexandria, who, lived, in, the, 6th, century, made, a, voyage, to, india, and, subsequently, wrote, works, on, cosmography, he, gives, a, description, of, a, unicorn, based, on, four, brass, figures, in, the, palace, of, the, king, of, ethiopia, he, states, from, report, that, it, is, impossible, to, take, this, ferocious, beast, alive, and, that, all, its, strength, lies, in, its, horn, when, it, finds, itself, pursued, and, in, danger, of, capture, it, throws, itself, from, a, precipice, and, turns, so, aptly, in, falling, that, it, receives, all, the, shock, upon, the, horn, and, so, escapes, safe, and, sound, medieval, knowledge, of, unicorns, stemmed, from, biblical, and, ancient, sources, and, unicorns, were, variously, represented, as, a, kind, of, wild, ass, goat, or, horse, several, european, medieval, travelers, claimed, to, have, seen, unicorns, in, their, travels, outside, of, europe, for, example, felix, fabri, claimed, to, have, seen, a, unicorn, in, sinai, the, predecessor, of, the, medieval, bestiary, compiled, in, late, antiquity, and, known, as, physiologus, popularized, an, elaborate, allegory, in, which, a, unicorn, trapped, by, a, maiden, representing, the, virgin, mary, stood, for, the, incarnation, as, soon, as, the, unicorn, sees, her, it, lays, its, head, on, her, lap, and, falls, asleep, 160, this, became, a, basic, emblematic, tag, that, underlies, medieval, notions, of, the, unicorn, justifying, its, appearance, in, both, secular, and, religious, art, the, unicorn, is, often, shown, hunted, raising, parallels, both, with, vulnerable, virgins, and, sometimes, the, passion, of, christ, the, myths, refer, to, a, beast, with, one, horn, that, can, only, be, tamed, by, a, virgin, subsequently, some, writers, translated, this, into, an, allegory, for, christ, s, relationship, with, the, virgin, mary, the, unicorn, also, figured, in, courtly, terms, for, some, 13th, century, french, authors, such, as, thibaut, of, champagne, and, richard, de, fournival, the, lover, is, attracted, to, his, lady, as, the, unicorn, is, to, the, virgin, with, the, rise, of, humanism, the, unicorn, also, acquired, more, orthodox, secular, meanings, emblematic, of, chaste, love, and, faithful, marriage, it, plays, this, role, in, petrarch, s, triumph, of, chastity, and, on, the, reverse, of, piero, della, francesca, s, portrait, of, battista, strozzi, paired, with, that, of, her, husband, federico, da, montefeltro, painted, c, 1472, 74, bianca, s, triumphal, car, is, drawn, by, a, pair, of, unicorns, however, when, the, unicorn, appears, in, the, medieval, legend, of, barlaam, and, josaphat, ultimately, derived, from, the, life, of, the, buddha, it, represents, death, as, the, golden, legend, explains, 184, unicorns, in, religious, art, largely, disappeared, after, they, were, condemned, by, molanus, after, the, council, of, trent, 305, the, unicorn, tamable, only, by, a, virgin, woman, was, well, established, in, medieval, lore, by, the, time, marco, polo, described, them, as, scarcely, smaller, than, elephants, they, have, the, hair, of, a, buffalo, and, feet, like, an, elephant, s, they, have, a, single, large, black, horn, in, the, middle, of, the, forehead, they, have, a, head, like, a, wild, boar, s, they, spend, their, time, by, preference, wallowing, in, mud, and, slime, they, are, very, ugly, brutes, to, look, at, they, are, not, at, all, such, as, we, describe, them, when, we, relate, that, they, let, themselves, be, captured, by, virgins, but, clean, contrary, to, our, notions, it, is, clear, that, marco, polo, was, describing, a, rhinoceros, the, horn, itself, and, the, substance, it, was, made, of, was, called, alicorn, and, it, was, believed, that, the, horn, holds, magical, and, medicinal, properties, the, danish, physician, ole, worm, determined, in, 1638, that, the, alleged, alicorns, were, the, tusks, of, narwhals, such, beliefs, were, examined, wittily, and, at, length, in, 1646, by, sir, thomas, browne, in, his, pseudodoxia, epidemica, false, alicorn, powder, made, from, the, tusks, of, narwhals, or, horns, of, various, animals, was, sold, in, europe, for, medicinal, purposes, as, late, as, 1741, the, alicorn, was, thought, to, cure, many, diseases, and, have, the, ability, to, detect, poisons, and, many, physicians, would, make, cures, and, sell, them, cups, were, made, from, alicorn, for, kings, and, given, as, a, gift, these, were, usually, made, of, ivory, or, walrus, ivory, entire, horns, were, very, precious, in, the, middle, ages, and, were, often, really, the, tusks, of, narwhals, one, traditional, method, of, hunting, unicorns, involved, entrapment, by, a, virgin, in, one, of, his, notebooks, leonardo, da, vinci, wrote, the, unicorn, through, its, intemperance, and, not, knowing, how, to, control, itself, for, the, love, it, bears, to, fair, maidens, forgets, its, ferocity, and, wildness, and, laying, aside, all, fear, it, will, go, up, to, a, seated, damsel, and, go, to, sleep, in, her, lap, and, thus, the, hunters, take, it, the, famous, late, gothic, series, of, seven, tapestry, hangings, the, hunt, of, the, unicorn, are, a, high, point, in, european, tapestry, manufacture, combining, both, secular, and, religious, themes, the, tapestries, now, hang, in, the, cloisters, division, of, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, in, the, series, richly, dressed, noblemen, accompanied, by, huntsmen, and, hounds, pursue, a, unicorn, against, mille, fleur, backgrounds, or, settings, of, buildings, and, gardens, they, bring, the, animal, to, bay, with, the, help, of, a, maiden, who, traps, it, with, her, charms, appear, to, kill, it, and, bring, it, back, to, a, castle, in, the, last, and, most, famous, panel, the, unicorn, in, captivity, the, unicorn, is, shown, alive, again, and, happy, chained, to, a, pomegranate, tree, surrounded, by, a, fence, in, a, field, of, flowers, scholars, conjecture, that, the, red, stains, on, its, flanks, are, not, blood, but, rather, the, juice, from, pomegranates, which, were, a, symbol, of, fertility, however, the, true, meaning, of, the, mysterious, resurrected, unicorn, in, the, last, panel, is, unclear, the, series, was, woven, about, 1500, in, the, low, countries, probably, brussels, or, li, ge, for, an, unknown, patron, a, set, of, six, engravings, on, the, same, theme, treated, rather, differently, were, engraved, by, the, french, artist, jean, duvet, in, the, 1540s, another, famous, set, of, six, tapestries, of, dame, la, licorne, lady, with, the, unicorn, in, the, mus, e, de, cluny, paris, were, also, woven, in, the, southern, netherlands, before, 1500, and, show, the, five, senses, the, gateways, to, temptation, and, finally, love, a, mon, seul, desir, the, legend, reads, with, unicorns, featured, in, each, piece, facsimiles, of, these, unicorn, tapestries, were, woven, for, permanent, display, in, stirling, castle, scotland, to, take, the, place, of, a, set, recorded, in, the, castle, in, a, 16th, century, inventory, a, rather, rare, late, 15th, century, variant, depiction, of, the, hortus, conclusus, in, religious, art, combined, the, annunciation, to, mary, with, the, themes, of, the, hunt, of, the, unicorn, and, virgin, and, unicorn, so, popular, in, secular, art, the, unicorn, already, functioned, as, a, symbol, of, the, incarnation, and, whether, this, meaning, is, intended, in, many, prima, facie, secular, depictions, can, be, a, difficult, matter, of, scholarly, interpretation, there, is, no, such, ambiguity, in, the, scenes, where, the, archangel, gabriel, is, shown, blowing, a, horn, as, hounds, chase, the, unicorn, into, the, virgin, s, arms, and, a, little, christ, child, descends, on, rays, of, light, from, god, the, father, the, council, of, trent, finally, banned, this, somewhat, over, elaborated, if, charming, depiction, partly, on, the, grounds, of, realism, as, no, one, now, believed, the, unicorn, to, be, a, real, animal, shakespeare, scholars, describe, unicorns, being, captured, by, a, hunter, standing, in, front, of, a, tree, the, unicorn, goaded, into, charging, the, hunter, would, step, aside, the, last, moment, and, the, unicorn, would, embed, its, horn, deeply, into, the, tree, see, annotations, of,

unicorn, is, often, depicted, as, a, horse, with, a, goat, s, cloven, hooves, and, beard, a, lion, s, tail, and, a, slender, spiral, horn, on, its, forehead, non, equine, attributes, may, be, replaced, with, equine, ones, whether, because, it, was, an, emblem, of, the, incarnation, or, of, the, fearsome, animal, passions, of, raw, nature, the, unicorn, was, not, widely, used, in, early, heraldry, but, became, popular, from, the, 15th, century, though, sometimes, shown, collared, and, chained, which, may, be, taken, as, an, indication, that, it, has, been, tamed, or, tempered, it, is, more, usually, shown, collared, with, a, broken, chain, attached, showing, that, it, has, broken, free, from, its, bondage, in, heraldry, the, unicorn, is, best, known, as, a, symbol, of, scotland, the, unicorn, was, believed, to, be, the, natural, enemy, of, the, lion, a, symbol, that, the, english, royals, had, adopted, around, a, hundred, years, before, two, unicorns, supported, the, royal, arms, of, the, king, of, scots, and, duke, of, rothesay, and, since, the, 1707, union, of, england, and, scotland, the, royal, arms, of, the, united, kingdom, have, been, supported, by, a, unicorn, along, with, an, english, lion, two, versions, of, the, royal, arms, exist, that, used, in, scotland, gives, more, emphasis, to, the, scottish, elements, placing, the, unicorn, on, the, left, and, giving, it, a, crown, whereas, the, version, used, in, england, and, elsewhere, gives, the, english, elements, more, prominence, john, guillim, in, his, book, a, display, of, heraldry, has, illustrated, the, unicorn, as, a, symbol, of, power, honor, and, respect, golden, coins, known, as, the, unicorn, and, half, unicorn, both, with, a, unicorn, on, the, obverse, were, used, in, scotland, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, in, the, same, realm, carved, unicorns, were, often, used, as, finials, on, the, pillars, of, mercat, crosses, and, denoted, that, the, settlement, was, a, royal, burgh, certain, noblemen, such, as, the, earl, of, kinnoull, were, given, special, permission, to, use, the, unicorn, in, their, arms, as, an, augmentation, of, honour, the, crest, for, clan, cunningham, bears, a, unicorn, head, unicorns, as, heraldic, charges, unicorns, as, supporters, by, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, unicorns, became, a, queer, icon, second, only, to, the, rainbow, flag, symbolizing, queerness, the, rainbow, flag, created, by, american, artist, gilbert, baker, in, 1978, as, a, joyous, symbol, of, the, diversity, of, the, queer, community, became, prominent, during, the, gay, rights, protests, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, unicorns, which, were, intrinsically, linked, to, rainbows, since, the, victorian, era, became, a, symbol, of, the, queer, community, there, is, no, consensus, on, how, the, unicorn, became, a, gay, icon, alice, fisher, an, editor, of, observer, design, magazine, notes, that, the, values, of, a, unicorn, as, rare, and, magical, have, resulted, in, the, word, being, used, with, various, connotations, however, she, argues, that, the, victorian, association, between, rainbows, and, unicorns, has, resulted, in, unicorns, becoming, a, queer, icon, when, directly, asked, queer, people, give, different, answers, about, why, they, have, close, personal, relationships, with, unicorns, they, often, relate, to, one, or, more, of, the, following, aspects, uniqueness, magical, quality, elusiveness, and, gender, fluidity, queer, individuals, tend, to, relate, to, the, unicorn, because, of, their, unique, sexual, orientation, and, gender, identity, a, new, orleans, journalist, tracey, anne, duncan, described, her, connection, to, unicorn, when, she, watched, the, last, unicorn, as, a, child, in, the, film, the, protagonist, believed, she, was, one, of, a, kind, throughout, her, life, tracey, was, able, to, relate, to, that, feeling, even, though, she, did, not, really, know, what, her, kind, was, at, that, time, the, unicorn, is, an, imaginary, animal, that, lives, in, a, world, of, myths, and, legends, queer, people, whose, existence, seems, to, blur, the, lines, between, societal, norms, of, masculinity, and, femininity, may, feel, like, they, do, not, fully, belong, in, this, world, it, explains, their, interests, in, mythical, creatures, such, as, unicorns, mermaids, and, fairies, some, argue, that, the, gender, fluidity, of, the, unicorn, makes, it, a, suitable, representation, of, the, lgbt, community, in, ancient, myths, the, unicorn, is, portrayed, as, male, whereas, in, the, modern, times, it, is, depicted, as, a, female, creature, an, animal, called, the, re, em, hebrew, is, mentioned, in, several, places, in, the, hebrew, bible, often, as, a, metaphor, representing, strength, the, allusions, to, the, re, em, as, a, wild, untamable, animal, of, great, strength, and, agility, with, mighty, horn, or, horns, best, fit, the, aurochs, bos, primigenius, this, view, is, further, supported, by, the, assyrian, cognate, word, rimu, which, is, often, used, as, a, metaphor, of, strength, and, is, depicted, as, a, powerful, fierce, wild, mountain, bull, with, large, horns, this, animal, was, often, depicted, in, ancient, mesopotamian, art, in, profile, with, only, one, horn, visible, the, translators, of, the, authorized, king, james, version, of, the, bible, 1611, followed, the, greek, septuagint, monokeros, and, the, latin, vulgate, unicornis, and, employed, unicorn, to, translate, re, em, providing, a, recognizable, animal, that, was, proverbial, for, its, untamable, nature, the, american, standard, version, translates, this, term, wild, ox, in, each, case, the, classical, jewish, understanding, of, the, bible, did, not, identify, the, re, em, animal, as, the, unicorn, however, some, rabbis, in, the, talmud, debate, the, proposition, that, the, tahash, animal, exodus, 25, 26, 35, 36, and, 39, numbers, 4, and, ezekiel, 16, 10, was, a, domestic, single, horned, kosher, creature, that, existed, in, moses, time, or, that, it, was, similar, to, the, keresh, animal, described, in, marcus, jastrow, s, talmudic, dictionary, as, a, kind, of, antelope, unicorn, the, qilin, chinese, a, creature, in, chinese, mythology, is, sometimes, called, the, chinese, unicorn, and, some, ancient, accounts, describe, a, single, horn, as, its, defining, feature, however, it, is, more, accurately, described, as, a, hybrid, animal, that, looks, less, unicorn, than, chimera, with, the, body, of, a, deer, the, head, of, a, lion, green, scales, and, a, long, forwardly, curved, horn, the, japanese, version, kirin, more, closely, resembles, the, western, unicorn, even, though, it, is, based, on, the, chinese, qilin, the, qu, ly, of, vietnamese, myth, similarly, sometimes, mistranslated, unicorn, is, a, symbol, of, wealth, and, prosperity, that, made, its, first, appearance, during, the, duong, dynasty, about, 600, ce, to, emperor, duong, cao, to,
