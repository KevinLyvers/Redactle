abstraction, is, a, process, wherein, general, concepts, and, rules, are, derived, from, the, use, and, classifying, of, specific, examples, literal, real, or, concrete, signifiers, first, principles, or, other, methods, an, abstraction, is, the, outcome, of, this, process, a, concept, that, acts, as, a, common, noun, for, all, subordinate, concepts, and, connects, any, related, concepts, as, a, group, field, or, category, conceptual, abstractions, may, be, made, by, filtering, the, information, content, of, a, concept, or, an, observable, phenomenon, selecting, only, those, aspects, which, are, relevant, for, a, particular, purpose, for, example, abstracting, a, leather, soccer, ball, to, the, more, general, idea, of, a, ball, selects, only, the, information, on, general, ball, attributes, and, behavior, excluding, but, not, eliminating, the, other, phenomenal, and, cognitive, characteristics, of, that, particular, ball, in, a, type, token, distinction, a, type, e, g, a, ball, is, more, abstract, than, its, tokens, e, g, that, leather, soccer, ball, abstraction, in, its, secondary, use, is, a, material, process, discussed, in, the, themes, below, thinking, in, abstractions, is, considered, by, anthropologists, archaeologists, and, sociologists, to, be, one, of, the, key, traits, in, modern, human, behaviour, which, is, believed, to, have, developed, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, years, ago, its, development, is, likely, to, have, been, closely, connected, with, the, development, of, human, language, which, whether, spoken, or, written, appears, to, both, involve, and, facilitate, abstract, thinking, abstraction, involves, induction, of, ideas, or, the, synthesis, of, particular, facts, into, one, general, theory, about, something, it, is, the, opposite, of, specification, which, is, the, analysis, or, breaking, down, of, a, general, idea, or, abstraction, into, concrete, facts, abstraction, can, be, illustrated, by, francis, bacon, s, novum, organum, 1620, a, book, of, modern, scientific, philosophy, written, in, the, late, jacobean, era, of, england, to, encourage, modern, thinkers, to, collect, specific, facts, before, making, any, generalizations, bacon, used, and, promoted, induction, as, an, abstraction, tool, it, complemented, but, was, distinct, from, the, ancient, deductive, thinking, approach, that, had, dominated, the, intellectual, world, since, the, times, of, greek, philosophers, like, thales, anaximander, and, aristotle, thales, c, 624, 546, bce, believed, that, everything, in, the, universe, comes, from, one, main, substance, water, he, deduced, or, specified, from, a, general, idea, everything, is, water, to, the, specific, forms, of, water, such, as, ice, snow, fog, and, rivers, modern, scientists, used, the, approach, of, abstraction, going, from, particular, facts, collected, into, one, general, idea, newton, 1642, 1727, derived, the, motion, of, the, planets, from, copernicus, 1473, 1543, simplification, that, the, sun, is, the, center, of, the, solar, system, kepler, 1571, 1630, compressed, thousands, of, measurements, into, one, expression, to, finally, conclude, that, mars, moves, in, an, elliptical, orbit, about, the, sun, galileo, 1564, 1642, repeated, one, hundred, specific, experiments, into, the, law, of, falling, bodies, an, abstraction, can, be, seen, as, a, compression, process, mapping, multiple, different, pieces, of, constituent, data, to, a, single, piece, of, abstract, data, based, on, similarities, in, the, constituent, data, for, example, many, different, physical, cats, map, to, the, abstraction, cat, this, conceptual, scheme, emphasizes, the, inherent, equality, of, both, constituent, and, abstract, data, thus, avoiding, problems, arising, from, the, distinction, between, abstract, and, concrete, in, this, sense, the, process, of, abstraction, entails, the, identification, of, similarities, between, objects, and, the, process, of, associating, these, objects, with, an, abstraction, which, is, itself, an, object, chains, of, abstractions, can, be, construed, moving, from, neural, impulses, arising, from, sensory, perception, to, basic, abstractions, such, as, color, or, shape, to, experiential, abstractions, such, as, a, specific, cat, to, semantic, abstractions, such, as, the, idea, of, a, cat, to, classes, of, objects, such, as, mammals, and, even, categories, such, as, object, as, opposed, to, action, non, existent, things, in, any, particular, place, and, time, are, often, seen, as, abstract, by, contrast, instances, or, members, of, such, an, abstract, thing, might, exist, in, many, different, places, and, times, those, abstract, things, are, then, said, to, be, multiply, instantiated, in, the, sense, of, picture, 1, picture, 2, etc, shown, below, it, is, not, sufficient, however, to, define, abstract, ideas, as, those, that, can, be, instantiated, and, to, define, abstraction, as, the, movement, in, the, opposite, direction, to, instantiation, doing, so, would, make, the, concepts, cat, and, telephone, abstract, ideas, since, despite, their, varying, appearances, a, particular, cat, or, a, particular, telephone, is, an, instance, of, the, concept, cat, or, the, concept, telephone, although, the, concepts, cat, and, telephone, are, abstractions, they, are, not, abstract, in, the, sense, of, the, objects, in, graph, 1, below, we, might, look, at, other, graphs, in, a, progression, from, cat, to, mammal, to, animal, and, see, that, animal, is, more, abstract, than, mammal, but, on, the, other, hand, mammal, is, a, harder, idea, to, express, certainly, in, relation, to, marsupial, or, monotreme, perhaps, confusingly, some, philosophies, refer, to, tropes, instances, of, properties, as, abstract, particulars, e, g, the, particular, redness, of, a, particular, apple, is, an, abstract, particular, this, is, similar, to, qualia, and, sumbebekos, still, retaining, the, primary, meaning, of, abstrere, or, to, draw, away, from, the, abstraction, of, money, for, example, works, by, drawing, away, from, the, particular, value, of, things, allowing, completely, incommensurate, objects, to, be, compared, see, the, section, on, physicality, below, karl, marx, s, writing, on, the, commodity, abstraction, recognizes, a, parallel, process, the, state, polity, as, both, concept, and, material, practice, exemplifies, the, two, sides, of, this, process, of, abstraction, conceptually, the, current, concept, of, the, state, is, an, abstraction, from, the, much, more, concrete, early, modern, use, as, the, standing, or, status, of, the, prince, his, visible, estates, at, the, same, time, materially, the, practice, of, statehood, is, now, constitutively, and, materially, more, abstract, than, at, the, time, when, princes, ruled, as, the, embodiment, of, extended, power, the, way, that, physical, objects, like, rocks, and, trees, have, being, differs, from, the, way, that, properties, of, abstract, concepts, or, relations, have, being, for, example, the, way, the, concrete, particular, individuals, pictured, in, picture, 1, exist, differs, from, the, way, the, concepts, illustrated, in, graph, 1, exist, that, difference, accounts, for, the, ontological, usefulness, of, the, word, abstract, the, word, applies, to, properties, and, relations, to, mark, the, fact, that, if, they, exist, they, do, not, exist, in, space, or, time, but, that, instances, of, them, can, exist, potentially, in, many, different, places, and, times, a, physical, object, a, possible, referent, of, a, concept, or, word, is, considered, concrete, not, abstract, if, it, is, a, particular, individual, that, occupies, a, particular, place, and, time, however, in, the, secondary, sense, of, the, term, abstraction, this, physical, object, can, carry, materially, abstracting, processes, for, example, record, keeping, aids, throughout, the, fertile, crescent, included, calculi, clay, spheres, cones, etc, which, represented, counts, of, items, probably, livestock, or, grains, sealed, in, containers, according, to, schmandt, besserat, 1981, these, clay, containers, contained, tokens, the, total, of, which, were, the, count, of, objects, being, transferred, the, containers, thus, served, as, something, of, a, bill, of, lading, or, an, accounts, book, in, order, to, avoid, breaking, open, the, containers, for, the, count, marks, were, placed, on, the, outside, of, the, containers, these, physical, marks, in, other, words, acted, as, material, abstractions, of, a, materially, abstract, process, of, accounting, using, conceptual, abstractions, numbers, to, communicate, its, meaning, abstract, things, are, sometimes, defined, as, those, things, that, do, not, exist, in, reality, or, exist, only, as, sensory, experiences, like, the, color, red, that, definition, however, suffers, from, the, difficulty, of, deciding, which, things, are, real, i, e, which, things, exist, in, reality, for, example, it, is, difficult, to, agree, to, whether, concepts, like, god, the, number, three, and, goodness, are, real, abstract, or, both, an, approach, to, resolving, such, difficulty, is, to, use, predicates, as, a, general, term, for, whether, things, are, variously, real, abstract, concrete, or, of, a, particular, property, e, g, good, questions, about, the, properties, of, things, are, then, propositions, about, predicates, which, propositions, remain, to, be, evaluated, by, the, investigator, in, the, graph, 1, below, the, graphical, relationships, like, the, arrows, joining, boxes, and, ellipses, might, denote, predicates, abstractions, sometimes, have, ambiguous, referents, for, example, happiness, can, mean, experiencing, various, positive, emotions, but, can, also, refer, to, life, satisfaction, and, subjective, well, being, likewise, architecture, refers, not, only, to, the, design, of, safe, functional, buildings, but, also, to, elements, of, creation, and, innovation, which, aim, at, elegant, solutions, to, construction, problems, to, the, use, of, space, and, to, the, attempt, to, evoke, an, emotional, response, in, the, builders, owners, viewers, and, users, of, the, building, abstraction, uses, a, strategy, of, simplification, wherein, formerly, concrete, details, are, left, ambiguous, vague, or, undefined, thus, effective, communication, about, things, in, the, abstract, requires, an, intuitive, or, common, experience, between, the, communicator, and, the, communication, recipient, this, is, true, for, all, verbal, abstract, communication, for, example, many, different, things, can, be, red, likewise, many, things, sit, on, surfaces, as, in, picture, 1, to, the, right, the, property, of, redness, and, the, relation, sitting, on, are, therefore, abstractions, of, those, objects, specifically, the, conceptual, diagram, graph, 1, identifies, only, three, boxes, two, ellipses, and, four, arrows, and, their, five, labels, whereas, the, picture, 1, shows, much, more, pictorial, detail, with, the, scores, of, implied, relationships, as, implicit, in, the, picture, rather, than, with, the, nine, explicit, details, in, the, graph, graph, 1, details, some, explicit, relationships, between, the, objects, of, the, diagram, for, example, the, arrow, between, the, agent, and, cat, elsie, depicts, an, example, of, an, is, a, relationship, as, does, the, arrow, between, the, location, and, the, mat, the, arrows, between, the, gerund, present, participle, sitting, and, the, nouns, agent, and, location, express, the, diagram, s, basic, relationship, agent, is, sitting, on, location, elsie, is, an, instance, of, cat, although, the, description, sitting, on, graph, 1, is, more, abstract, than, the, graphic, image, of, a, cat, sitting, on, a, mat, picture, 1, the, delineation, of, abstract, things, from, concrete, things, is, somewhat, ambiguous, this, ambiguity, or, vagueness, is, characteristic, of, abstraction, thus, something, as, simple, as, a, newspaper, might, be, specified, to, six, levels, as, in, douglas, hofstadter, s, illustration, of, that, ambiguity, with, a, progression, from, abstract, to, concrete, in, g, del, escher, bach, 1979, an, abstraction, can, thus, encapsulate, each, of, these, levels, of, detail, with, no, loss, of, generality, but, perhaps, a, detective, or, philosopher, scientist, engineer, might, seek, to, learn, about, something, at, progressively, deeper, levels, of, detail, to, solve, a, crime, or, a, puzzle, in, philosophical, terminology, abstraction, is, the, thought, process, wherein, ideas, are, distanced, from, objects, but, an, idea, can, be, symbolized, typically, abstraction, is, used, in, the, arts, as, a, synonym, for, abstract, art, in, general, strictly, speaking, it, refers, to, art, unconcerned, with, the, literal, depiction, of, things, from, the, visible, world, it, can, however, refer, to, an, object, or, image, which, has, been, distilled, from, the, real, world, or, indeed, another, work, of, art, artwork, that, reshapes, the, natural, world, for, expressive, purposes, is, called, abstract, that, which, derives, from, but, does, not, imitate, a, recognizable, subject, is, called, nonobjective, abstraction, in, the, 20th, century, the, trend, toward, abstraction, coincided, with, advances, in, science, technology, and, changes, in, urban, life, eventually, reflecting, an, interest, in, psychoanalytic, theory, later, still, abstraction, was, manifest, in, more, purely, formal, terms, such, as, color, freedom, from, objective, context, and, a, reduction, of, form, to, basic, geometric, designs, computer, scientists, use, abstraction, to, make, models, that, can, be, used, and, re, used, without, having, to, re, write, all, the, program, code, for, each, new, application, on, every, different, type, of, computer, they, communicate, their, solutions, with, the, computer, by, writing, source, code, in, some, particular, computer, language, which, can, be, translated, into, machine, code, for, different, types, of, computers, to, execute, abstraction, allows, program, designers, to, separate, a, framework, categorical, concepts, related, to, computing, problems, from, specific, instances, which, implement, details, this, means, that, the, program, code, can, be, written, so, that, code, does, not, have, to, depend, on, the, specific, details, of, supporting, applications, operating, system, software, or, hardware, but, on, a, categorical, concept, of, the, solution, a, solution, to, the, problem, can, then, be, integrated, into, the, system, framework, with, minimal, additional, work, this, allows, programmers, to, take, advantage, of, another, programmer, s, work, while, requiring, only, an, abstract, understanding, of, the, implementation, of, another, s, work, apart, from, the, problem, that, it, solves, abstractions, and, levels, of, abstraction, play, an, important, role, in, the, theory, of, general, semantics, originated, by, alfred, korzybski, anatol, rapoport, wrote, abstracting, is, a, mechanism, by, which, an, infinite, variety, of, experiences, can, be, mapped, on, short, noises, words, francis, fukuyama, defines, history, as, a, deliberate, attempt, of, abstraction, in, which, we, separate, out, important, from, unimportant, events, researchers, in, linguistics, frequently, apply, abstraction, so, as, to, allow, an, analysis, of, the, phenomena, of, language, at, the, desired, level, of, detail, a, commonly, used, abstraction, the, phoneme, abstracts, speech, sounds, in, such, a, way, as, to, neglect, details, that, cannot, serve, to, differentiate, meaning, other, analogous, kinds, of, abstractions, sometimes, called, emic, units, considered, by, linguists, include, morphemes, graphemes, and, lexemes, abstraction, also, arises, in, the, relation, between, syntax, semantics, and, pragmatics, pragmatics, involves, considerations, that, make, reference, to, the, user, of, the, language, semantics, considers, expressions, and, what, they, denote, the, designata, abstracted, from, the, language, user, and, syntax, considers, only, the, expressions, themselves, abstracted, from, the, designata, abstraction, in, mathematics, is, the, process, of, extracting, the, underlying, structures, patterns, or, properties, of, a, mathematical, concept, or, object, removing, any, dependence, on, real, world, objects, with, which, it, might, originally, have, been, connected, and, generalizing, it, so, that, it, has, wider, applications, or, matching, among, other, abstract, descriptions, of, equivalent, phenomena, the, advantages, of, abstraction, in, mathematics, are, the, main, disadvantage, of, abstraction, is, that, highly, abstract, concepts, are, more, difficult, to, learn, and, might, require, a, degree, of, mathematical, maturity, and, experience, before, they, can, be, assimilated, in, music, the, term, abstraction, can, be, used, to, describe, improvisatory, approaches, to, interpretation, and, may, sometimes, indicate, abandonment, of, tonality, atonal, music, has, no, key, signature, and, is, characterized, by, the, exploration, of, internal, numeric, relationships, a, recent, meta, analysis, suggests, that, the, verbal, system, has, a, greater, engagement, with, abstract, concepts, when, the, perceptual, system, is, more, engaged, in, processing, concrete, concepts, this, is, because, abstract, concepts, elicit, greater, brain, activity, in, the, inferior, frontal, gyrus, and, middle, temporal, gyrus, compared, to, concrete, concepts, which, elicit, greater, activity, in, the, posterior, cingulate, precuneus, fusiform, gyrus, and, parahippocampal, gyrus, other, research, into, the, human, brain, suggests, that, the, left, and, right, hemispheres, differ, in, their, handling, of, abstraction, for, example, one, meta, analysis, reviewing, human, brain, lesions, has, shown, a, left, hemisphere, bias, during, tool, usage, abstraction, in, philosophy, is, the, process, or, to, some, the, alleged, process, in, concept, formation, of, recognizing, some, set, of, common, features, in, individuals, and, on, that, basis, forming, a, concept, of, that, feature, the, notion, of, abstraction, is, important, to, understanding, some, philosophical, controversies, surrounding, empiricism, and, the, problem, of, universals, it, has, also, recently, become, popular, in, formal, logic, under, predicate, abstraction, another, philosophical, tool, for, the, discussion, of, abstraction, is, thought, space, john, locke, defined, abstraction, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, so, words, are, used, to, stand, as, outward, marks, of, our, internal, ideas, which, are, taken, from, particular, things, but, if, every, particular, idea, that, we, take, in, had, its, own, special, name, there, would, be, no, end, to, names, to, prevent, this, the, mind, makes, particular, ideas, received, from, particular, things, become, general, which, it, does, by, considering, them, as, they, are, in, the, mind, mental, appearances, separate, from, all, other, existences, and, from, the, circumstances, of, real, existence, such, as, time, place, and, so, on, this, procedure, is, called, abstraction, in, it, an, idea, taken, from, a, particular, thing, becomes, a, general, representative, of, all, of, the, same, kind, and, its, name, becomes, a, general, name, that, is, applicable, to, any, existing, thing, that, fits, that, abstract, idea, 2, 11, 9, carl, jung, s, definition, of, abstraction, broadened, its, scope, beyond, the, thinking, process, to, include, exactly, four, mutually, exclusive, different, complementary, psychological, functions, sensation, intuition, feeling, and, thinking, together, they, form, a, structural, totality, of, the, differentiating, abstraction, process, abstraction, operates, in, one, of, these, functions, when, it, excludes, the, simultaneous, influence, of, the, other, functions, and, other, irrelevancies, such, as, emotion, abstraction, requires, selective, use, of, this, structural, split, of, abilities, in, the, psyche, the, opposite, of, abstraction, is, concretism, abstraction, is, one, of, jung, s, 57, definitions, in, chapter, xi, of, psychological, types, there, is, an, abstract, thinking, just, as, there, is, abstract, feeling, sensation, and, intuition, abstract, thinking, singles, out, the, rational, logical, qualities, abstract, feeling, does, the, same, with, its, feeling, values, i, put, abstract, feelings, on, the, same, level, as, abstract, thoughts, abstract, sensation, would, be, aesthetic, as, opposed, to, sensuous, sensation, and, abstract, intuition, would, be, symbolic, as, opposed, to, fantastic, intuition, jung, 1971, par, 678, social, theorists, deal, with, abstraction, both, as, an, ideational, and, as, a, material, process, alfred, sohn, rethel, 1899, 1990, asked, can, there, be, abstraction, other, than, by, thought, he, used, the, example, of, commodity, abstraction, to, show, that, abstraction, occurs, in, practice, as, people, create, systems, of, abstract, exchange, that, extend, beyond, the, immediate, physicality, of, the, object, and, yet, have, real, and, immediate, consequences, this, work, was, extended, through, the, constitutive, abstraction, approach, of, writers, associated, with, the, journal, arena, two, books, that, have, taken, this, theme, of, the, abstraction, of, social, relations, as, an, organizing, process, in, human, history, are, nation, formation, towards, a, theory, of, abstract, community, 1996, and, an, associated, volume, published, in, 2006, globalism, nationalism, tribalism, bringing, theory, back, in, these, books, argue, that, a, nation, is, an, abstract, community, bringing, together, strangers, who, will, never, meet, as, such, thus, constituting, materially, real, and, substantial, but, abstracted, and, mediated, relations, the, books, suggest, that, contemporary, processes, of, globalization, and, mediatization, have, contributed, to, materially, abstracting, relations, between, people, with, major, consequences, for, how, humans, live, their, lives, one, can, readily, argue, that, abstraction, is, an, elementary, methodological, tool, in, several, disciplines, of, social, science, these, disciplines, have, definite, and, different, concepts, of, man, that, highlight, those, aspects, of, man, and, his, behaviour, by, idealization, that, are, relevant, for, the, given, human, science, for, example, homo, sociologicus, is, the, man, as, sociology, abstracts, and, idealizes, it, depicting, man, as, a, social, being, moreover, we, could, talk, about, homo, cyber, sapiens, the, man, who, can, extend, his, biologically, determined, intelligence, thanks, to, new, technologies, or, homo, creativus, who, is, simply, creative, abstraction, combined, with, weberian, idealization, plays, a, crucial, role, in, economics, hence, abstractions, such, as, the, market, and, the, generalized, concept, of, business, breaking, away, from, directly, experienced, reality, was, a, common, trend, in, 19th, century, sciences, especially, physics, and, this, was, the, effort, which, fundamentally, determined, the, way, economics, tried, and, still, tries, to, approach, the, economic, aspects, of, social, life, it, is, abstraction, we, meet, in, the, case, of, both, newton, s, physics, and, the, neoclassical, theory, since, the, goal, was, to, grasp, the, unchangeable, and, timeless, essence, of, phenomena, for, example, newton, created, the, concept, of, the, material, point, by, following, the, abstraction, method, so, that, he, abstracted, from, the, dimension, and, shape, of, any, perceptible, object, preserving, only, inertial, and, translational, motion, material, point, is, the, ultimate, and, common, feature, of, all, bodies, neoclassical, economists, created, the, indefinitely, abstract, notion, of, homo, economicus, by, following, the, same, procedure, economists, abstract, from, all, individual, and, personal, qualities, in, order, to, get, to, those, characteristics, that, embody, the, essence, of, economic, activity, eventually, it, is, the, substance, of, the, economic, man, that, they, try, to, grasp, any, characteristic, beyond, it, only, disturbs, the, functioning, of, this, essential, core
