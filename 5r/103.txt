but, who, interacts, with, humans, positively, or, negatively, in, ways, that, carry, humans, to, new, levels, of, consciousness, beyond, the, grounded, preoccupations, of, ordinary, life, religions, can, be, categorized, by, how, many, deities, they, worship, monotheistic, religions, accept, only, one, deity, predominantly, referred, to, as, god, whereas, polytheistic, religions, accept, multiple, deities, henotheistic, religions, accept, one, supreme, deity, without, denying, other, deities, considering, them, as, aspects, of, the, same, divine, principle, nontheistic, religions, deny, any, supreme, eternal, creator, deity, but, may, accept, a, pantheon, of, deities, which, live, die, and, may, be, reborn, like, any, other, being, 35, 37, 357, 358, although, most, monotheistic, religions, traditionally, envision, their, god, as, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and, eternal, none, of, these, qualities, are, essential, to, the, definition, of, a, deity, and, various, cultures, have, conceptualized, their, deities, differently, monotheistic, religions, typically, refer, to, their, god, in, masculine, terms, 96, while, other, religions, refer, to, their, deities, in, a, variety, of, ways, male, female, hermaphroditic, or, genderless, many, cultures, including, the, ancient, mesopotamians, egyptians, greeks, romans, and, germanic,

actions, yet, tied, up, with, emotions, and, desires, in, other, cases, the, deity, is, a, principle, or, reality, such, as, the, idea, of, soul, the, upanishads, of, hinduism, for, example, characterize, atman, soul, self, as, deva, deity, thereby, asserting, that, the, deva, and, eternal, supreme, principle, brahman, is, part, of, every, living, creature, that, this, soul, is, spiritual, and, divine, and, that, to, realize, self, knowledge, is, to, know, the, supreme, theism, is, the, belief, in, the, existence, of, one, or, more, deities, polytheism, is, the, belief, in, and, worship, of, multiple, deities, which, are, usually, assembled, into, a, pantheon, of, gods, and, goddesses, with, accompanying, rituals, in, most, polytheistic, religions, the, different, gods, and, goddesses, are, representations, of, forces, of, nature, or, ancestral, principles, and, can, be, viewed, either, as, autonomous, or, as, aspects, or, emanations, of, a, creator, god, or, transcendental, absolute, principle, monistic, theologies, which, manifests, immanently, in, nature, henotheism, accepts, the, existence, of, more, than, one, deity, but, considers, all, deities, as, equivalent, representations, or, aspects, of, the, same, divine, principle, the, highest, monolatry, is, the, belief, that, many, deities, exist, but, that, only, one, of, these, deities, may, be, validly, worshipped, monotheism, is, the, belief, that, only, one, deity, exists, a, monotheistic, deity, known, as, god, is, usually, described, as, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and, eternal, however, not, all, deities, have, been, regarded, this, way, and, an, entity, does, not, need, to, be, almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, or, eternal, to, qualify, as, a, deity, deism, is, the, belief, that, only, one, deity, exists, who, created, the, universe, but, does, not, usually, intervene, in, the, resulting, world, deism, was, particularly, popular, among, western, intellectuals, during, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, pantheism, is, the, belief, that, the, universe, itself, is, god, or, that, everything, composes, an, all, encompassing, immanent, deity, pandeism, is, an, intermediate, position, between, these, proposing, that, the, creator, became, a, pantheistic, universe, panentheism, is, the, belief, that, divinity, pervades, the, universe, but, that, it, also, transcends, the, universe, agnosticism, is, the, position, that, it, is, impossible, to, know, for, certain, whether, a, deity, of, any, kind, exists, atheism, is, the, non, belief, in, the, existence, of, any, deity, scholars, infer, the, probable, existence, of, deities, in, the, prehistoric, period, from, inscriptions, and, prehistoric, arts, such, as, cave, drawings, but, it, is, unclear, what, these, sketches, and, paintings, are, and, why, they, were, made, some, engravings, or, sketches, show, animals, hunters, or, rituals, it, was, once, common, for, archaeologists, to, interpret, virtually, every, prehistoric, female, figurine, as, a, representation, of, a, single, primordial, goddess, the, ancestor, of, historically, attested, goddesses, such, as, inanna, ishtar, astarte, cybele, and, aphrodite, this, approach, has, now, generally, been, discredited, modern, archaeologists, now, generally, recognize, that, it, is, impossible, to, conclusively, identify, any, prehistoric, figurines, as, representations, of, any, kind, of, deities, let, alone, goddesses, nonetheless, it, is, possible, to, evaluate, ancient, representations, on, a, case, by, case, basis, and, rate, them, on, how, likely, they, are, to, represent, deities, the, venus, of, willendorf, a, female, figurine, found, in, europe, and, dated, to, about, 25, 000, bce, has, been, interpreted, by, some, as, an, exemplar, of, a, prehistoric, female, deity, a, number, of, probable, representations, of, deities, have, been, discovered, at, ain, ghazal, and, the, works, of, art, uncovered, at, atalh, y, k, reveal, references, to, what, is, probably, a, complex, mythology, diverse, african, cultures, developed, theology, and, concepts, of, deities, over, their, history, in, nigeria, and, neighboring, west, african, countries, for, example, two, prominent, deities, locally, called, r, are, found, in, the, yoruba, religion, namely, the, god, ogun, and, the, goddess, osun, ogun, is, the, primordial, masculine, deity, as, well, as, the, archdivinity, and, guardian, of, occupations, such, as, tools, making, and, use, metal, working, hunting, war, protection, and, ascertaining, equity, and, justice, osun, is, an, equally, powerful, primordial, feminine, deity, and, a, multidimensional, guardian, of, fertility, water, maternal, health, social, relations, love, and, peace, ogun, and, osun, traditions, were, brought, into, the, americas, on, slave, ships, they, were, preserved, by, the, africans, in, their, plantation, communities, and, their, festivals, continue, to, be, observed, in, southern, african, cultures, a, similar, masculine, feminine, deity, combination, has, appeared, in, other, forms, particularly, as, the, moon, and, sun, deities, one, southern, african, cosmology, consists, of, hieseba, or, xuba, deity, god, gaune, evil, spirits, and, khuene, people, the, hieseba, includes, nladiba, male, creator, sky, god, and, nladisara, females, nladiba, s, two, wives, the, sun, female, and, the, moon, male, deities, are, viewed, as, offspring, of, nladiba, and, two, nladisara, the, sun, and, moon, are, viewed, as, manifestations, of, the, supreme, deity, and, worship, is, timed, and, directed, to, them, in, other, african, cultures, the, sun, is, seen, as, male, while, the, moon, is, female, both, symbols, of, the, godhead, 199, 120, in, zimbabwe, the, supreme, deity, is, androgynous, with, male, female, aspects, envisioned, as, the, giver, of, rain, treated, simultaneously, as, the, god, of,

terms, for, deities, were, n, r, god, and, feminine, n, rt, goddess, 42, however, these, terms, may, also, have, applied, to, any, being, spirits, and, deceased, human, beings, but, not, demons, who, in, some, way, were, outside, the, sphere, of, everyday, life, 216, 62, egyptian, deities, typically, had, an, associated, cult, role, and, mythologies, 7, 8, 83, around, 200, deities, are, prominent,

osiris, shu, sia, and, thoth, 11, 12, most, egyptian, deities, represented, natural, phenomenon, physical, objects, or, social, aspects, of, life, as, hidden, immanent, forces, within, these, phenomena, the, deity, shu, for, example, represented, air, the, goddess, meretseger, represented, parts, of, the, earth, and, the, god, sia, represented, the, abstract, powers, of, perception, 91,

involved, in, multiple, phenomena, 85, 86, the, first, written, evidence, of, deities, are, from, early, 3rd, millennium, bce, likely, emerging, from, prehistoric, beliefs, however, deities, became, systematized, and, sophisticated, after, the, formation, of, an, egyptian, state, under, the, pharaohs, and, their, treatment, as, sacred, kings, who, had, exclusive, rights, to, interact, with, the, gods, in, the, later, part, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, 12, 15, through, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, as, egyptians, interacted, and, traded, with, neighboring, cultures, foreign,

alongside, their, own, national, god, yahweh, el, later, became, syncretized, with, yahweh, who, took, over, el, s, role, as, the, head, of, the, pantheon, 13, 17, with, asherah, as, his, divine, consort, 45, 146, and, the, sons, of, el, as, his, offspring, 22, 24, during, the, later, years, of, the, kingdom, of, judah, a, monolatristic, faction, rose, to, power, insisting, that, only, yahweh, was, fit, to, be, worshipped, by, the, people, of, judah, 229, 233, monolatry, became, enforced, during, the, reforms, of, king, josiah, in, 621, bce, 229, finally, during, the, national, crisis, of, the, babylonian, captivity, some, judahites, began, to, teach, that, deities, aside, from, yahweh, were, not, just, unfit, to, be, worshipped, but, did, not, exist, 4, the, sons, of, el, were, demoted, from, deities, to, angels, 22, ancient, mesopotamian, culture, in, southern, iraq, had, numerous, dingir, deities, gods, and, goddesses, 69, 74, mesopotamian, deities, were, almost,

was, affirmed, with, certainty, in, the, sixth, century, second, isaiah, and, has, ever, since, been, the, axiomatic, basis, of, its, theology, 4, the, classical, presentation, of, judaism, has, been, as, a, monotheistic, faith, that, rejected, deities, and, related, idolatry, however, states, breslauer, modern, scholarship, suggests, that, idolatry, was, not, absent, in, biblical, faith, and, it, resurfaced, multiple, times, in, jewish, religious, life, the, rabbinic, texts, and, other, secondary, jewish, literature, suggest, worship, of, material, objects, and, natural, phenomena, through, the, medieval, era, while, the, core, teachings, of, judaism, maintained, monotheism, according, to, aryeh, kaplan, god, is, always, referred, to, as, he, in, judaism, not, to, imply, that, the, concept, of, sex, or, gender, applies, to, god, but, because, there, is, no, neuter, in, the, hebrew, language, and, the, hebrew, word, for, god, is, a, masculine, noun, as, he, is, an, active, rather, than, a, passive, creative, force, in, mandaeism, hayyi, rabbi, lit, the, great, life, or, the, great, living, god, is, the, supreme, god, from, which, all, things, emanate, he, is, also, known, as, the, first, life, since, during, the, creation, of, the, material, world, yushamin, emanated, from, hayyi, rabbi, as, the, second, life, the, principles, of, the, mandaean, doctrine, the, belief, of, the, only, one, great, god, hayyi, rabbi, to, whom, all, absolute, properties, belong, he, created, all, the, worlds, formed, the, soul, through, his, power, and, placed, it, by, means, of, angels, into, the, human, body, so, he, created, adam, and, eve, the, first, man, and, woman, mandaeans, recognize, god, to, be, the, eternal, creator, of, all, the, one, and, only, in,

contributing, to, the, sheer, diversity, of, deities, in, anitism, the, supreme, deity, or, deities, of, ethnic, groups, are, almost, always, the, most, notable, for, example, bathala, is, the, tagalog, supreme, deity, mangechay, is, the, kapampangan, supreme, deity, malayari, is, the, sambal, supreme, deity, melu, is, the, blaan, supreme, deity, kaptan, is, the, bisaya, supreme, deity, and, so, on, although, buddhists, do, not, believe, in, a, creator, deity, deities, are, an, essential, part, of, buddhist, teachings, about, cosmology, rebirth, and, sa, s, ra, buddhist, deities, such, as, devas, and, bodhisattvas, are, believed, to, reside, in, a, pleasant, heavenly, realm, within, buddhist, cosmology, which, is, typically, subdivided, into, twenty, six, sub, realms, 35, devas, are, numerous, but, they, are, still, mortal, they, live, in, the, heavenly, realm, then, die, and, are, reborn, like, all, other, beings, a, rebirth, in, the, heavenly, realm, is, believed, to, be, the, result, of, leading, an, ethical, life, and, accumulating, very, good, karma, a, deva, does, not, need, to, work, and, is, able, to, enjoy, in, the, heavenly, realm, all, pleasures, found, on, earth, however, the, pleasures, of, this, realm, lead, to, attachment, up, d, na, lack, of, spiritual, pursuits, and, therefore, no, nirvana, 37, nonetheless, according, to, kevin, trainor, the, vast, majority, of, buddhist, lay, people, in, countries, practicing, theravada, have, historically, pursued, buddhist, rituals, and, practices, because, they, are, motivated, by, their, potential, rebirth, into, the, deva, realm, the, deva, realm, in, buddhist, practice, in, southeast, asia, and, east, asia, states, keown, include, gods, found, in, hindu, traditions, such, as, indra, and, brahma, and, concepts, in, hindu, cosmology, such, as, mount, meru, 37, 38, mahayana, buddhism, also, includes, different, kinds, of, deities, such, as, numerous, buddhas, bodhisattvas, and, fierce, deities, the, concept, of, god, varies, in, hinduism, it, being, a, diverse, system, of, thought, with, beliefs, spanning, henotheism, monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, and, monism, among, others, in, the, ancient, vedic, texts, of, hinduism, a, deity, is, often, referred, to, as, deva, god, or, devi, goddess, 496, the, root, of, these, terms, mean, heavenly, divine, anything, of, excellence, 492, deva, is, masculine, and, the, related, feminine, equivalent, is, devi, in, the, earliest, vedic, literature, all, supernatural, beings, are, called, asuras, 5, 11, 22, 99, 102, 121, over, time, those, with, a, benevolent, nature, become, deities, and, are, referred, to, as, sura, deva, or, devi, 2, 6, devas, or, deities, in, hindu, texts, differ, from, greek, or, roman, theodicy, states, ray, billington, because, many, hindu, traditions, believe, that, a, human, being, has, the, potential, to, be, reborn, as, a, deva, or, devi, by, living, an, ethical, life, and, building, up, saintly, karma, such, a, deva, enjoys, heavenly, bliss, till, the, merit, runs, out, and, then, the, soul, is, reborn, again, into, sa, s, ra, thus, deities, are, henotheistic, manifestations, embodiments, and, consequence, of, the, virtuous, the, noble, the, saint, like, living, in, many, hindu, traditions, shinto, is, polytheistic, involving, the, veneration, of, many, deities, known, as, kami, or, sometimes, as, jingi, in, japanese, no, distinction, is, made, here, between, singular, and, plural, and, hence, the, term, kami, refers, both, to, individual, kami, and, the, collective, group, of, kami, although, lacking, a, direct, english, translation, the, term, kami, has, sometimes, been, rendered, as, god, or, spirit, the, historian, of, religion, joseph, kitagawa, deemed, these, english, translations, quite, unsatisfactory, and, misleading, and, various, scholars, urge, against, translating, kami, into, english, in, japanese, it, is, often, said, that, there, are, eight, million, kami, a, term, which, connotes, an, infinite, number, and, shinto, practitioners, believe, that, they, are, present, everywhere, they, are, not, regarded, as, omnipotent, omniscient,

tao, persons, with, vast, supernatural, powers, unpredictable, changes, and, immortality, jainism, does, not, believe, in, a, creator, omnipotent, omniscient, eternal, god, however, the, cosmology, of, jainism, incorporates, a, meaningful, causality, driven, reality, including, four, realms, of, existence, gati, one, of, them, being, deva, celestial, beings, gods, 351, 357, a, human, being, can, choose, and, live, an, ethical, life, such, as, being, non, violent, ahimsa, against, all, living, beings, and, thereby, gain, merit, and, be, reborn, as, deva, 357, 358, jain, texts, reject, a, trans, cosmic, god, one, who, stands, outside, of, the, universe, and, lords, over, it, but, they, state, that, the, world, is, full, of, devas, who, are, in, human, image, with, sensory, organs, with, the, power, of, reason, conscious, compassionate, and, with, finite, life, 356, 357, jainism, believes, in, the, existence, of, the, soul, self, atman, and, considers, it, to, have, god, quality, whose, knowledge, and, liberation, is, the, ultimate, spiritual, goal, in, both, religions, jains, also, believe, that, the, spiritual, nobleness, of, perfected, souls, jina, and, devas, make, them, worship, worthy, beings, with, powers, of, guardianship, and, guidance, to, better, karma, in, jain, temples, or, festivals, the, jinas, and, devas, are, revered, 356, 357, ahura, mazda, h, r, m, z, d, is, the, avestan, name, for, the, creator, and, sole, god, of, zoroastrianism, the, literal, meaning, of, the, word, ahura, is, mighty, or, lord, and, mazda, is, wisdom, zoroaster, the, founder, of, zoroastrianism, taught, that, ahura, mazda, is, the, most, powerful, being, in, all, of, the, existence, and, the, only, deity, who, is, worthy, of, the, highest, veneration, nonetheless, ahura, mazda, is, not, omnipotent, because, his, evil, twin, brother, angra, mainyu, is, nearly, as, powerful, as, him, zoroaster, taught, that, the, daevas, were, evil, spirits, created, by, angra, mainyu, to, sow, evil, in, the, world, and, that, all, people, must, choose, between, the, goodness, of, ahura, mazda, and, the, evil, of, angra, mainyu, according, to, zoroaster, ahura, mazda, will, eventually, defeat, angra, mainyu, and, good, will, triumph, over, evil, once, and, for, all, ahura, mazda, was, the, most, important, deity, in, the, ancient, achaemenid, empire, he, was, originally, represented, anthropomorphically, but, by, the, end, of, the, sasanian, empire, zoroastrianism, had, become, fully, aniconic, attempts, to, rationally, explain, belief, in, deities, extend, all, the, way, back, to, ancient, greece, 311, 317, the, greek, philosopher, democritus, argued, that, the, concept, of, deities, arose, when, human, beings, observed, natural, phenomena, such, as, lightning, solar, eclipses, and, the, changing, of, the, seasons, 311, 317, later, in, the, third, century, bce, the, scholar, euhemerus, argued, in, his, book, sacred, history, that, the, gods, were, originally, flesh, and, blood, mortal, kings, who, were, posthumously, deified, and, that, religion, was, therefore, the, continuation, of, these, kings, mortal, reigns, a, view, now, known, as, euhemerism, sigmund, freud, suggested, that, god, concepts, are, a, projection, of, one, s, father, a, tendency, to, believe, in, deities, and, other, supernatural, beings, may, be, an, integral, part, of, the, human, consciousness, 2, 11, children, are, naturally, inclined, to, believe, in, supernatural, entities, such, as, gods, spirits, and, demons, even, without, being, introduced, into, a, particular, religious, tradition, 2, 11, humans, have, an, overactive, agency, detection, system, 25, 27, which, has, a, tendency, to, conclude, that, events, are, caused, by, intelligent, entities, even, if, they, really, are, not, this, is, a, system, which, may, have, evolved, to, cope, with, threats, to, the, survival, of, human, ancestors, in, the, wild, a, person, who, perceived, intelligent, and, potentially, dangerous, beings, everywhere, was, more, likely, to, survive, than, a, person, who, failed, to, perceive, actual, threats, such, as, wild, animals, or, human, enemies, 2, 11, humans, are, also, inclined, to, think, teleologically, and, ascribe, meaning, and, significance, to, their, surroundings, a, trait, which, may, lead, people, to, believe, in, a, creator, deity, this, may, have, developed, as, a, side, effect, of, human, social, intelligence, the, ability, to, discern, what, other, people, are, thinking, stories, of, encounters, with, supernatural, beings, are, especially, likely, to, be, retold, passed, on, and, embellished, due, to, their, descriptions, of, standard, ontological, categories, person, artifact, animal, plant, natural, object, with, counterintuitive, properties, humans, that, are, invisible, houses, that, remember, what, happened, in, them, etc, as, belief, in, deities, spread, humans, may, have, attributed, anthropomorphic, thought, processes, to, them, leading, to, the, idea, of, leaving, offerings, to, the, gods, and, praying, to, them, for, assistance, ideas, which, are, seen, in, all, cultures, around, the, world, sociologists, of, religion, have, proposed, that, the, personality, and, characteristics, of, deities, may, reflect, a, culture, s, sense, of, self, esteem, and, that, a, culture, projects, its, revered, values, into, deities, and, in, spiritual, terms, the, cherished, desired, or, sought, human, personality, is, congruent, with, the, personality, it, defines, to, be, gods, lonely, and, fearful, societies, tend, to, invent, wrathful, violent, submission, seeking, deities, while, happier, and, secure, societies, tend, to, invent, loving, non, violent, compassionate, deities, mile, durkheim, states, that, gods, represent, an, extension, of, human, social, life, to, include, supernatural, beings, according, to, matt, rossano, god, concepts, may, be, a, means, of, enforcing, morality, and, building, more, cooperative, community, groups
