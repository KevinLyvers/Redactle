the, son, of, jupiter, and, juno, and, was, pre, eminent, among, the, roman, army, s, military, gods, most, of, his, festivals, were, held, in, march, the, month, named, for, him, latin, martius, and, in, october, the, months, which, traditionally, began, and, ended, the, season, for, both, military, campaigning, and, farming, under, the, influence, of, greek, culture, mars, was, identified, with, the, greek, god, ares, whose, myths, were, reinterpreted, in, roman, literature, and, art, under, the, name, of, mars, the, character, and, dignity, of, mars, differs, in, fundamental, ways, from, that, of, his, greek, counterpart, who, is, often, treated, with, contempt, and, revulsion, in, greek, literature, mars, s, altar, in, the, campus, martius, the, area, of, rome, that, took, its, name, from, him, was, supposed, to, have, been, dedicated, by, numa, the, peace, loving, semi, legendary, second, king, of, rome, in, republican, times, it, was, a, focus, of, electoral, activities, augustus, shifted, the, focus, of, mars, cult, to, within, the, pomerium, rome, s, ritual, boundary, and, built, a, temple, to, mars, ultor, as, a, key, religious, feature, of, his, new, forum, unlike, ares, who, was, viewed, primarily, as, a, destructive, and, destabilizing, force, mars, represented, military, power, as, a, way, to, secure, peace, and, was, a, father, pater, of, the, roman, people, in, rome, s, mythic, genealogy, and, founding, mars, fathered, romulus, and, remus, through, his, rape, of, rhea, silvia, his, love, affair, with, venus, symbolically, reconciled, two, different, traditions, of, rome, s, founding, venus, was, the, divine, mother, of, the, hero, aeneas, celebrated, as, the, trojan, refugee, who, founded, rome, several, generations, before, romulus, laid, out, the, city, walls, the, word, m, rs, genitive, m, rtis, which, in, old, latin, and, poetic, usage, also, appears, as, m, vors, m, vortis, is, cognate, with, oscan, m, mers, m, mertos, the, oldest, recorded, latin, form, mamart, is, likely, of, foreign, origin, it, has, been, explained, as, deriving, from, maris, the, name, of, an, etruscan, child, god, though, this, is, not, universally, agreed, upon, scholars, have, varying, views, on, whether, the, two, gods, are, related, and, if, so, how, latin, adjectives, from, the, name, of, mars, are, martius, and, martialis, from, which, derive, english, martial, as, in, martial, arts, or, martial, law, and, personal, names, such, as, marcus, mark, and, martin, mars, may, ultimately, be, a, thematic, reflex, of, the, proto, indo, european, god, perkwunos, having, originally, a, thunderer, character, like, ares, who, was, the, son, of, zeus, and, hera, mars, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, son, of, jupiter, and, juno, in, ovid, s, version, of, mars, origin, he, was, the, son, of, juno, alone, jupiter, had, usurped, the, accepted, function, of, women, as, mothers, when, he, gave, birth, to, minerva, directly, from, his, forehead, or, mind, juno, sought, the, advice, of, the, goddess, flora, on, how, to, do, the, same, flora, obtained, a, magic, flower, latin, flos, plural, flores, a, masculine, word, and, tested, it, on, a, heifer, who, became, fecund, at, once, flora, ritually, plucked, a, flower, using, her, thumb, touched, juno, s, belly, and, impregnated, her, juno, withdrew, to, thrace, and, the, shore, of, marmara, for, the, birth, ovid, tells, this, story, in, the, fasti, his, long, form, poetic, work, on, the, roman, calendar, it, may, explain, why, the, matronalia, a, festival, celebrated, by, married, women, in, honor, of, juno, as, a, goddess, of, childbirth, occurred, on, the, first, day, of, mars, s, month, which, is, also, marked, on, a, calendar, from, late, antiquity, as, the, birthday, of, mars, in, the, earliest, roman, calendar, march, was, the, first, month, and, the, god, would, have, been, born, with, the, new, year, ovid, is, the, only, source, for, the, story, he, may, be, presenting, a, literary, myth, of, his, own, invention, or, an, otherwise, unknown, archaic, italic, tradition, either, way, in, choosing, to, include, the, story, he, emphasizes, that, mars, was, connected, to, plant, life, and, was, not, alienated, from, female, nurture, the, consort, of, mars, was, nerio, or, neriene, valor, she, represents, the, vital, force, vis, power, potentia, and, majesty, maiestas, of, mars, her, name, was, regarded, as, sabine, in, origin, and, is, equivalent, to, latin, virtus, manly, virtue, from, vir, man, in, the, early, 3rd, century, bce, the, comic, playwright, plautus, has, a, reference, to, mars, greeting, nerio, his, wife, a, source, from, late, antiquity, says, that, mars, and, neriene, were, celebrated, together, at, a, festival, held, on, march, 23, in, the, later, roman, empire, neriene, came, to, be, identified, with, minerva, nerio, probably, originates, as, a, divine, personification, of, mars, s, power, as, such, abstractions, in, latin, are, generally, feminine, her, name, appears, with, that, of, mars, in, an, archaic, prayer, invoking, a, series, of, abstract, qualities, each, paired, with, the, name, of, a, deity, the, influence, of, greek, mythology, and, its, anthropomorphic, gods, may, have, caused, roman, writers, to, treat, these, pairs, as, marriages, the, union, of, venus, and, mars, held, greater, appeal, for, poets, and, philosophers, and, the, couple, were, a, frequent, subject, of, art, in, greek, myth, the, adultery, of, ares, and, aphrodite, had, been, exposed, to, ridicule, when, her, husband, hephaestus, whose, roman, equivalent, was, vulcan, caught, them, in, the, act, by, means, of, a, magical, snare, although, not, originally, part, of, the, roman, tradition, in, 217, bce, venus, and, mars, were, presented, as, a, complementary, pair, in, the, lectisternium, a, public, banquet, at, which, images, of, twelve, major, gods, of, the, roman, state, were, presented, on, couches, as, if, present, and, participating, scenes, of, venus, and, mars, in, roman, art, often, ignore, the, adulterous, implications, of, their, union, and, take, pleasure, in, the, good, looking, couple, attended, by, cupid, or, multiple, loves, amores, some, scenes, may, imply, marriage, and, the, relationship, was, romanticized, in, funerary, or, domestic, art, in, which, husbands, and, wives, had, themselves, portrayed, as, the, passionate, divine, couple, the, uniting, of, deities, representing, love, and, war, lent, itself, to, allegory, especially, since, the, lovers, were, the, parents, of, concordia, the, renaissance, philosopher, marsilio, ficino, notes, that, only, venus, dominates, mars, and, he, never, dominates, her, in, ancient, roman, and, renaissance, art, mars, is, often, shown, disarmed, and, relaxed, or, even, sleeping, but, the, extramarital, nature, of, their, affair, can, also, suggest, that, this, peace, is, impermanent, virility, as, a, kind, of, life, force, vis, or, virtue, virtus, is, an, essential, characteristic, of, mars, as, an, agricultural, guardian, he, directs, his, energies, toward, creating, conditions, that, allow, crops, to, grow, which, may, include, warding, off, hostile, forces, of, nature, the, priesthood, of, the, arval, brothers, called, on, mars, to, drive, off, rust, lues, with, its, double, meaning, of, wheat, fungus, and, the, red, oxides, that, affect, metal, a, threat, to, both, iron, farm, implements, and, weaponry, in, the, surviving, text, of, their, hymn, the, arval, brothers, invoked, mars, as, ferus, savage, or, feral, like, a, wild, animal, mars, s, potential, for, savagery, is, expressed, in, his, obscure, connections, to, the, wild, woodlands, and, he, may, even, have, originated, as, a, god, of, the, wild, beyond, the, boundaries, set, by, humans, and, thus, a, force, to, be, propitiated, in, his, book, on, farming, cato, invokes, mars, silvanus, for, a, ritual, to, be, carried, out, in, silva, in, the, woods, an, uncultivated, place, that, if, not, held, within, bounds, can, threaten, to, overtake, the, fields, needed, for, crops, mars, s, character, as, an, agricultural, god, may, derive, solely, from, his, role, as, a, defender, and, protector, or, may, be, inseparable, from, his, warrior, nature, as, the, leaping, of, his, armed, priests, the, salii, was, meant, to, quicken, the, growth, of, crops, it, appears, that, mars, was, originally, a, thunderer, or, storm, deity, which, explains, some, of, his, mixed, traits, in, regards, to, fertility, this, role, was, later, taken, in, the, roman, pantheon, by, several, other, gods, such, as, summanus, or, jupiter, the, wild, animals, most, sacred, to, mars, were, the, woodpecker, and, the, wolf, which, in, the, natural, lore, of, the, romans, were, said, always, to, inhabit, the, same, foothills, and, woodlands, plutarch, notes, that, the, woodpecker, picus, is, sacred, to, mars, because, it, is, a, courageous, and, spirited, bird, and, has, a, beak, so, strong, that, it, can, overturn, oaks, by, pecking, them, until, it, has, reached, the, inmost, part, of, the, tree, as, the, beak, of, the, picus, martius, contained, the, god, s, power, to, ward, off, harm, it, was, carried, as, a, magic, charm, to, prevent, bee, stings, and, leech, bites, the, bird, of, mars, also, guarded, a, woodland, herb, paeonia, used, for, treatment, of, the, digestive, or, female, reproductive, systems, those, who, sought, to, harvest, it, were, advised, to, do, so, by, night, lest, the, woodpecker, jab, out, their, eyes, the, picus, martius, seems, to, have, been, a, particular, species, but, authorities, differ, on, which, one, perhaps, picus, viridis, or, dryocopus, martius, the, woodpecker, was, revered, by, the, latin, peoples, who, abstained, from, eating, its, flesh, it, was, one, of, the, most, important, birds, in, roman, and, italic, augury, the, practice, of, reading, the, will, of, the, gods, through, watching, the, sky, for, signs, the, mythological, figure, named, picus, had, powers, of, augury, that, he, retained, when, he, was, transformed, into, a, woodpecker, in, one, tradition, picus, was, the, son, of, mars, the, umbrian, cognate, peiqu, also, means, woodpecker, and, the, italic, picenes, were, supposed, to, have, derived, their, name, from, the, picus, who, served, as, their, guide, animal, during, a, ritual, migration, ver, sacrum, undertaken, as, a, rite, of, mars, in, the, territory, of, the, aequi, another, italic, people, mars, had, an, oracle, of, great, antiquity, where, the, prophecies, were, supposed, to, be, spoken, by, a, woodpecker, perched, on, a, wooden, column, mars, s, association, with, the, wolf, is, familiar, from, what, may, be, the, most, famous, of, roman, myths, the, story, of, how, a, she, wolf, lupa, suckled, his, infant, sons, when, they, were, exposed, by, order, of, king, amulius, who, feared, them, because, he, had, usurped, the, throne, from, their, grandfather, numitor, the, woodpecker, also, brought, nourishment, to, the, twins, the, wolf, appears, elsewhere, in, roman, art, and, literature, in, masculine, form, as, the, animal, of, mars, a, statue, group, that, stood, along, the, appian, way, showed, mars, in, the, company, of, wolves, at, the, battle, of, sentinum, in, 295, bce, the, appearance, of, the, wolf, of, mars, martius, lupus, was, a, sign, that, roman, victory, was, to, come, in, roman, gaul, the, goose, was, associated, with, the, celtic, forms, of, mars, and, archaeologists, have, found, geese, buried, alongside, warriors, in, graves, the, goose, was, considered, a, bellicose, animal, because, it, is, easily, provoked, to, aggression, ancient, greek, and, roman, religion, distinguished, between, animals, that, were, sacred, to, a, deity, and, those, that, were, prescribed, as, the, correct, sacrificial, offerings, for, the, god, wild, animals, might, be, viewed, as, already, belonging, to, the, god, to, whom, they, were, sacred, or, at, least, not, owned, by, human, beings, and, therefore, not, theirs, to, give, since, sacrificial, meat, was, eaten, at, a, banquet, after, the, gods, received, their, portion, mainly, the, entrails, exta, it, follows, that, the, animals, sacrificed, were, most, often, though, not, always, domestic, animals, normally, part, of, the, roman, diet, gods, often, received, castrated, male, animals, as, sacrifices, and, the, goddesses, female, victims, mars, however, regularly, received, intact, males, mars, did, receive, oxen, under, a, few, of, his, cult, titles, such, as, mars, grabovius, but, the, usual, offering, was, the, bull, singly, in, multiples, or, in, combination, with, other, animals, the, two, most, distinctive, animal, sacrifices, made, to, mars, were, the, suovetaurilia, a, triple, offering, of, a, pig, sus, ram, ovis, and, bull, taurus, and, the, october, horse, the, only, horse, sacrifice, known, to, have, been, carried, out, in, ancient, rome, and, a, rare, instance, of, a, victim, the, romans, considered, inedible, the, earliest, center, in, rome, for, cultivating, mars, as, a, deity, was, the, altar, of, mars, ara, martis, in, the, campus, martius, field, of, mars, outside, the, sacred, boundary, of, rome, pomerium, the, romans, thought, that, this, altar, had, been, established, by, the, semi, legendary, numa, pompilius, the, peace, loving, successor, of, romulus, according, to, roman, tradition, the, campus, martius, had, been, consecrated, to, mars, by, their, ancestors, to, serve, as, horse, pasturage, and, an, equestrian, training, ground, for, youths, during, the, roman, republic, 509, 27, bce, the, campus, was, a, largely, open, expanse, no, temple, was, built, at, the, altar, but, from, 193, bce, a, covered, walkway, connected, it, to, the, porta, fontinalis, near, the, office, and, archives, of, the, roman, censors, newly, elected, censors, placed, their, curule, chairs, by, the, altar, and, when, they, had, finished, conducting, the, census, the, citizens, were, collectively, purified, with, a, suovetaurilia, there, a, frieze, from, the, so, called, altar, of, domitius, ahenobarbus, is, thought, to, depict, the, census, and, may, show, mars, himself, standing, by, the, altar, as, the, procession, of, victims, advances, the, main, temple, of, mars, aedes, martis, in, the, republican, period, also, lay, outside, the, sacred, boundary, and, was, devoted, to, the, god, s, warrior, aspect, it, was, built, to, fulfill, a, vow, votum, made, by, a, titus,

literary, sources, the, sculpture, group, of, mars, and, the, wolves, was, displayed, there, soldiers, sometimes, assembled, at, the, temple, before, heading, off, to, war, and, it, was, the, point, of, departure, for, a, major, parade, of, roman, cavalry, held, annually, on, july, 15, a, temple, to, mars, in, the, circus, flaminius, was, built, around, 133, bce, funded, by, decimus, junius,

integrated, mars, into, imperial, cult, the, 4th, century, latin, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, treats, mars, as, one, of, several, classical, roman, deities, who, remained, cultic, realities, up, to, his, own, time, mars, and, specifically, mars, ultor, was, among, the, gods, who, received, sacrifices, from, julian, the, only, emperor, to, reject, christianity, after, the, conversion, of,

implacable, of, the, gods, but, valerius, maximus, concludes, his, history, by, invoking, mars, gradivus, as, author, and, support, of, the, name, roman, gradivus, is, asked, along, with, capitoline, jupiter, and, vesta, as, the, keeper, of, rome, s, perpetual, flame, to, guard, preserve, and, protect, the, state, of, rome, the, peace, and, the, princeps, the, emperor, tiberius, at, the, time, a,

quirites, citizens, or, civilians, as, divided, into, curiae, citizen, assemblies, whose, oaths, were, required, to, make, a, treaty, as, a, guarantor, of, treaties, mars, quirinus, is, thus, a, god, of, peace, when, he, rampages, mars, is, called, gradivus, but, when, he, s, at, peace, quirinus, the, deified, romulus, was, identified, with, mars, quirinus, in, the, capitoline, triad, of, jupiter, mars, and, quirinus, however, mars, and, quirinus, were, two, separate, deities, though, not, perhaps, in, origin, each, of, the, three, had, his, own, flamen, specialized, priest, but, the, functions, of, the, flamen, martialis, and, flamen, quirinalis, are, hard, to, distinguish, mars, is, invoked, as, grabovius, in, the, iguvine, tablets, bronze, tablets, written, in, umbrian, that,
