fulfilled, in, the, mission, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, and, that, he, will, return, in, a, second, coming, to, fulfill, the, rest, of, messianic, prophecies, moreover, unlike, the, judaic, concept, of, the, messiah, jesus, christ, is, considered, the, son, of, god, although, in, the, jewish, faith, the, king, of, israel, was, also, metaphorically, called, the, son, of, god, in, islam, jesus, arabic, romanized, isa, is, held, to, have, been, a, prophet, and, the, messiah, sent, to, the, israelites, who, will, return, to, earth, at, the, end, of, times, along, with, the, mahdi, and, defeat, al, masih, ad, dajjal, the, false, messiah, in, ahmadiyya, theology, these, prophecies, concerning, the, mahdi, and, the, second, coming, of, jesus, are, believed, to, have, been, fulfilled, in, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, 1835, 1908, the, founder, of, the, ahmadiyya, movement, wherein, the, terms, messiah, and, mahdi, are, synonyms, for, one, and, the, same, person, in, controversial, chabad, messianism, yosef, yitzchak, schneersohn, r, 1920, 1950, sixth, rebbe, spiritual, leader, of, chabad, lubavitch, and, menachem, mendel, schneerson, 1902, 1994, seventh, rebbe, of, chabad, are, messiah, claimants, messiah, hebrew, m, a, or, mashiach, imperial, aramaic, classical, syriac, m, latin, messias, literally, means, anointed, one, in, hebrew, the, messiah, is, often, referred, to,

by, caressing, is, the, arabic, word, for, messiah, used, by, both, arab, christians, and, muslims, in, modern, arabic, it, is, used, as, one, of, the, many, titles, of, jesus, referred, to, as, yas, al, masih, by, arab, christians, and, s, al, mas, by, muslims, the, literal, translation, of, the, hebrew, word, mashiach, messiah, is, anointed, which, refers, to, a, ritual, of, consecrating, someone, or, something, by, putting, holy, oil, upon, it, it, is, used, throughout, the, hebrew, bible, in, reference, to, a, wide, variety, of, individuals, and, objects, for, example, kings, priests, and, prophets, the, altar, in, the, temple, vessels, unleavened, bread, and, even, a, non, jewish, king, cyrus, the, great, in, jewish, eschatology, the, term, came, to, refer, to, a, future, jewish, king, from, the, davidic, line, who, will, be, anointed, with, holy, anointing, oil, to, be, king, of, god, s, kingdom, and, rule, the, jewish, people, during, the, messianic, age, in, judaism, the, messiah, is, not, considered, to, be, god, or, a, pre, existent, divine, son, of, god, he, is, considered, to, be, a, great, political, leader, that, has, descended, from, king, david, hence, why, he, is, referred, to, as, messiah, ben, david, messiah, son, of, david, in, judaism, the, messiah, is, considered, to, be, a, great, charismatic, leader, that, is, well, oriented, with, the, laws, that, are, followed, in, judaism, though, originally, a, fringe, idea, somewhat, controversially, belief, in, the, eventual, coming, of, a, future, messiah, is, a, fundamental, part, of, judaism, and, is, one, of, maimonides, 13, principles, of, faith, maimonides, describes, the, identity, of, the, messiah, in, the, following, terms, and, if, a, king, shall, arise, from, among, the, house, of, david, studying, torah, and, occupied, with, commandments, like, his, father, david, according, to, the, written, and, oral, torah, and, he, will, impel, all, of, israel, to, follow, it, and, to, strengthen, breaches, in, its, observance, and, will, fight, god, s, wars, this, one, is, to, be, treated, as, if, he, were, the, anointed, one, if, he, succeeded, and, built, the, holy, temple, in, its, proper, place, and, gathered, the, dispersed, ones, of, israel, together, this, is, indeed, the, anointed, one, for, certain, and, he, will, mend, the, entire, world, to, worship, the, lord, together, as, it, is, stated, for, then, i, shall, turn, for, the, nations, a, clear, tongue, so, that, they, will, all, proclaim, the, name, of, the, lord, and, to, worship, him, with, a, united, resolve, zephaniah, 3, 9, even, though, the, eventual, coming, of, the, messiah, is, a, strongly, upheld, belief, in, judaism, trying, to, predict, the, actual, time, when, the, messiah, will, come, is, an, act, that, is, frowned, upon, these, kinds, of, actions, are, thought, to, weaken, the, faith, the, people, have, in, the, religion, so, in, judaism, there, is, no, specific, time, when, the, messiah, comes, rather, it, is, the, acts, of, the, people, that, determines, when, the, messiah, comes, it, is, said, that, the, messiah, would, come, either, when, the, world, needs, his, coming, the, most, when, the, world, is, so, sinful, and, in, desperate, need, of, saving, by, the, messiah, or, deserves, it, the, most, when, genuine, goodness, prevails, in, the, world, a, common, modern, rabbinic, interpretation, is, that, there, is, a, potential, messiah, in, every, generation, the, talmud, which, often, uses, stories, to, make, a, moral, point, aggadah, tells, of, a, highly, respected, rabbi, who, found, the, messiah, at, the, gates, of, rome, and, asked, him, when, will, you, finally, come, he, was, quite, surprised, when, he, was, told, today, overjoyed, and, full, of, anticipation, the, man, waited, all, day, the, next, day, he, returned, disappointed, and, puzzled, and, asked, you, said, messiah, would, come, today, but, he, didn, t, come, what, happened, the, messiah, replied, scripture, says, today, if, you, will, but, hearken, to, his, voice, a, kabbalistic, tradition, within, judaism, is, that, the, commonly, discussed, messiah, who, will, usher, in, a, period, of, freedom, and, peace, messiah, ben, david, will, be, preceded, by, messiah, ben, joseph, who, will, gather, the, children, of, israel, around, him, leading, them, to, jerusalem, after, overcoming, the, hostile, powers, in, jerusalem, messiah, ben, joseph, will, reestablish, the, temple, worship, and, set, up, his, own, dominion, then, armilus, according, to, one, group, of, sources, or, gog, and, magog, according, to, the, other, will, appear, with, their, hosts, before, jerusalem, wage, war, against, messiah, ben, joseph, and, slay, him, his, corpse, according, to, one, group, will, lie, unburied, in, the, streets, of, jerusalem, according, to, the, other, it, will, be, hidden, by, the, angels, with, the, bodies, of, the, patriarchs, until, messiah, ben, david, comes, and, brings, him, back, to, life, yosef, yitzchak, schneersohn, r, 1920, 1950, sixth, rebbe, hereditary, chassidic, leader, of, chabad, lubavitch, and, menachem, mendel, schneerson, 1902, 1994, seventh, rebbe, of, chabad, are, messiah, claimants, as, per, chabad, lubavitch, messianism, menachem, mendel, schneerson, openly, declared, his, deceased, father, in, law, the, former, 6th, rebbe, of, chabad, lubavitch, to, be, the, messiah, he, published, about, yosef, yitzchak, schneersohn, to, be, atzmus, u, mehus, alein, vi, er, hat, zich, areingeshtalt, in, a, guf, yiddish, and, english, for, essence, and, existence, which, has, placed, itself, in, a, body, the, gravesite, of, his, deceased, father, in, law, yosef, yitzchak, schneersohn, known, as, the, ohel, became, a, central, point, of, focus, for, menachem, mendel, schneerson, s, prayers, and, supplications, regarding, the, deceased, menachem, mendel, schneerson, a, later, chabad, halachic, ruling, claims, that, it, was, incumbent, on, every, single, jew, to, heed, the, rebbe, s, words, and, believe, that, he, is, indeed, king, moshiach, who, will, be, revealed, imminently, outside, of, chabad, messianism, in, judaism, there, is, no, basis, to, these, claims, if, anything, this, resembles, the, faith, in, the, resurrection, of, jesus, and, his, second, coming, in, early, christianity, and, therefore, heretical, in, judaism, still, today, the, deceased, rabbi, menachem, mendel, schneerson, is, believed, to, be, the, messiah, among, adherents, of, the, chabad, movement, and, his, second, coming, is, believed, to, be, imminent, he, is, venerated, and, invocated, to, by, thousands, of, visitors, and, letters, each, year, at, the, ohel, especially, in, a, pilgrimage, each, year, on, the, anniversary, of, his, death, originating, from, the, concept, in, judaism, the, messiah, in, christianity, is, called, the, christ, from, greek, khrist, s, translating, the, hebrew, word, of, the, same, meaning, christ, became, the, accepted, christian, designation, and, title, of, jesus, of, nazareth, as, christians, believe, that, the, messianic, prophecies, in, the, old, testament, that, he, is, descended, from, the, davidic, line, and, was, declared, king, of, the, jews, were, fulfilled, in, his, mission, death, and, resurrection, while, the, rest, of, the, prophecies, that, he, will, usher, in, a, messianic, age, and, the, world, to, come, will, be, fulfilled, at, his, second, coming, some, christian, denominations, such, as, catholicism, instead, believe, in, amillenialist, theology, but, the, catholic, church, has, not, adopted, this, term, the, majority, of, historical, and, mainline, christian, theologies, consider, jesus, to, be, the, son, of, god, and, god, the, son, a, concept, of, the, messiah, fundamentally, different, from, the, jewish, and, islamic, concepts, in, each, of, the, four, new, testament, gospels, the, only, literal, anointing, of, jesus, is, conducted, by, a, woman, in, the, gospels, of, mark, matthew, and, john, this, anointing, occurs, in, bethany, outside, jerusalem, in, the, gospel, of, luke, the, anointing, scene, takes, place, at, an, indeterminate, location, but, the, context, suggests, it, to, be, in, galilee, or, even, a, separate, anointing, altogether, aside, from, jesus, the, book, of, isaiah, refers, to, cyrus, the, great, king, of, the, achaemenid, empire, as, a, messiah, for, his, decree, to, rebuild, the, jerusalem, temple, events, figures, events, and, terms, events, the, islamic, faith, uses, the, arabic, term, al, mas, pronounced, to, refer, to, jesus, however, the, meaning, is, different, from, that, found, in, christianity, and, judaism, though, islam, shares, many, of, the, beliefs, and, characteristics, of, the, two, semitic, abrahamic, monotheistic, religions, which, preceded, it, the, idea, of, messianism, which, is, of, central, importance, in, judaism, and, christianity, is, alien, to, islam, as, represented, by, the, qur, an, unlike, the, christian, view, of, the, death, of, jesus, most, muslims, believe, jesus, was, raised, to, heaven, without, being, put, on, the, cross, and, god, created, a, resemblance, to, appear, exactly, like, jesus, who, was, crucified, instead, of, jesus, and, he, ascended, bodily, to, heaven, there, to, remain, until, his, second, coming, in, the, end, days, the, quran, states, that, jesus, isa, the, son, of, maryam, isa, ibn, maryam, is, the, messiah, al, masih, and, prophet, sent, to, the, children, of, israel, according, to, qadi, al, nu, man, a, famous, muslim, jurist, of, the, fatimid, period, the, quran, identifies, jesus, as, the, messiah, because, he, was, sent, to, the, people, who, responded, to, him, in, order, to, remove, masaha, their, impurities, the, ailments, of, their, faith, whether, apparent, z, hir, or, hidden, b, tin, jesus, is, one, of, the, most, important, prophets, in, the, islamic, tradition, along, with, noah, abraham, moses, and, muhammad, unlike, christians, muslims, see, jesus, as, a, prophet, but, not, as, god, himself, or, the, son, of, god, this, is, because, prophecy, in, human, form, does, not, represent, the, true, powers, of, god, contrary, to, the, popular, depiction, of, jesus, in, christianity, thus, like, all, other, islamic, prophets, jesus, is, one, of, the, grand, prophets, who, receives, revelations, from, god, according, to, religious, scholar, mona, siddiqui, in, islam, rophecy, allows, god, to, remain, veiled, and, there, is, no, suggestion, in, the, qur, an, that, god, wishes, to, reveal, of, himself, just, yet, prophets, guarantee, interpretation, of, revelation, and, that, god, s, message, will, be, understood, in, sura, 19, the, quran, describes, the, birth, of, isa, and, sura, 4, explicitly, states, isa, as, the, son, of, maryam, sunni, muslims, believe, isa, is, alive, in, heaven, and, did, not, die, in, the, crucifixion, sura, 4, verses, 157, 158, also, states, that, but, they, neither, killed, nor, crucified, him, it, was, only, made, to, appear, so, according, to, religious, scholar, mahmoud, ayoub, jesus, close, proximity, or, nearness, qurb, to, god, is, affirmed, in, the, qur, anic, insistence, that, jesus, did, not, die, but, was, taken, up, to, god, and, remains, with, god, while, the, quran, does, not, state, that, he, will, come, back, islamic, tradition, nevertheless, believes, that, jesus, preceded, closely, by, al, mahdi, will, return, at, the, end, of, times, and, exercise, his, power, of, healing, he, will, forever, destroy, the, falsehood, embodied, in, al, masih, ad, dajjal, the, false, messiah, the, great, falsifier, a, figure, similar, to, the, antichrist, in, christianity, who, will, emerge, shortly, before, yawm, al, qiy, mah, the, day, of, resurrection, after, he, has, destroyed, ad, dajjal, his, final, task, will, be, to, become, leader, of, the, muslims, isa, will, unify, the, muslim, ummah, the, followers, of, islam, under, the, common, purpose, of, worshipping, god, alone, in, pure, islam, thereby, ending, divisions, and, deviations, by, adherents, mainstream, muslims, believe, that, at, that, time, isa, will, dispel, christian, and, jewish, claims, about, him, a, hadith, in, abu, dawud, says, the, prophet, said, there, is, no, prophet, between, me, and, him, that, is, isa, he, will, descend, to, the, earth, when, you, see, him, recognise, him, a, man, of, medium, height, reddish, fair, wearing, two, light, yellow, garments, looking, as, if, drops, were, falling, down, from, his, head, though, it, will, not, be, wet, he, will, fight, the, people, for, the, cause, of, islam, he, will, break, the, cross, kill, swine, and, abolish, jizyah, allah, will, perish, all, religions, except, islam, he, will, destroy, the, antichrist, and, will, live, on, the, earth, for, forty, years, and, then, he, will, die, the, muslims, will, pray, over, him, both, sunni, and, shia, muslims, agree, that, al, mahdi, will, arrive, first, and, after, him, isa, isa, will, proclaim, al, mahdi, as, the, islamic, community, leader, a, war, will, be, fought, the, dajjal, against, al, mahdi, and, isa, this, war, will, mark, the, approach, of, the, coming, of, the, last, day, after, isa, slays, al, dajj, l, at, the, gate, of, lud, he, will, bear, witness, and, reveal, that, islam, is, indeed, the, true, and, last, word, from, god, to, humanity, as, yusuf, ali, s, translation, reads, and, there, is, none, of, the, people, of, the, book, but, must, believe, in, him, before, his, death, and, on, the, day, of, judgment, he, will, be, a, witness, against, them, a, hadith, in, sahih, bukhari, says, allah, s, apostle, said, how, will, you, be, when, the, son, of, mariam, descends, among, you, and, your, imam, is, from, among, you, the, quran, denies, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, claiming, that, he, was, neither, killed, nor, crucified, the, quran, also, emphasizes, the, difference, between, god, and, the, messiah, those, who, say, that, allah, is, the, messiah, son, of, mary, are, unbelievers, the, messiah, said, o, children, of, israel, worship, allah, my, lord, and, your, lord, unbelievers, too, are, those, who, have, said, that, allah, is, the, third, of, three, the, messiah, son, of, mary, was, only, a, messenger, before, whom, other, messengers, had, gone, the, twelver, branch, of, shia, or, shi, i, islam, which, significantly, values, and, revolves, around, the, twelve, imams, spiritual, leaders, differs, significantly, from, the, beliefs, of, sunni, islam, unlike, sunni, islam, messianism, is, an, essential, part, of, religious, belief, and, practice, for, almost, all, shi, a, muslims, shi, i, islam, believes, that, the, last, imam, will, return, again, with, the, return, of, jesus, according, to, religious, scholar, mona, siddiqui, shi, is, are, acutely, aware, of, the, existence, everywhere, of, the, twelfth, imam, who, disappeared, in, 874, shi, i, piety, teaches, that, the, hidden, imam, will, return, with, jesus, christ, to, set, up, the, messianic, kingdom, before, the, final, judgement, day, when, all, humanity, will, stand, before, god, there, is, some, controversy, as, to, the, identity, of, this, imam, there, are, sources, that, underscore, how, the, shia, sect, agrees, with, the, jews, and, christians, that, imam, mehdi, al, mahdi, is, another, name, for, elijah, whose, return, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, messiah, was, prophesied, in, the, old, testament, the, imams, and, fatima, will, have, a, direct, impact, on, the, judgements, rendered, that, day, representing, the, ultimate, intercession, there, is, debate, on, whether, shi, i, muslims, should, accept, the, death, of, jesus, religious, scholar, mahmoud, ayoub, argues, modern, shi, i, thinkers, have, allowed, the, possibility, that, jesus, died, and, only, his, spirit, was, taken, up, to, heaven, conversely, siddiqui, argues, that, shi, i, thinkers, believe, jesus, was, neither, crucified, nor, slain, she, also, argues, that, shi, i, muslims, believe, that, the, twelfth, imam, did, not, die, but, was, taken, to, god, to, return, in, god, s, time, and, will, return, at, the, end, of, history, to, establish, the, kingdom, of, god, on, earth, as, the, expected, mahdi, in, the, theology, of, ahmadiyya, the, terms, messiah, and, mahdi, are, synonymous, terms, for, one, and, the, same, person, the, term, mahdi, means, guided, thus, implying, a, direct, ordainment, by, god, of, a, divinely, chosen, individual, according, to, ahmadi, thought, messiahship, is, a, phenomenon, through, which, a, special, emphasis, is, given, on, the, transformation, of, a, people, by, way, of, offering, to, suffer, for, the, sake, of, god, instead, of, giving, suffering, i, e, refraining, from, revenge, ahmadis, believe, that, this, special, emphasis, was, given, through, the, person, of, jesus, and, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, 1835, 1908, among, others, ahmadis, hold, that, the, prophesied, eschatological, figures, of, christianity, and, islam, the, messiah, and, mahdi, were, in, fact, to, be, fulfilled, in, one, person, who, was, to, represent, all, previous, prophets, numerous, hadith, are, presented, by, the, ahmadis, in, support, of, their, view, such, as, one, from, sunan, ibn, majah, which, says, there, is, no, mahdi, other, than, jesus, son, of, mary, ahmadis, believe, that, the, prophecies, concerning, the, mahdi, and, the, second, coming, of, jesus, have, been, fulfilled, in, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, 1835, 1908, the, founder, of, the, ahmadiyya, movement, unlike, mainstream, muslims, the, ahmadis, do, not, believe, that, jesus, is, alive, in, heaven, but, that, he, survived, the, crucifixion, and, migrated, towards, the, east, where, he, died, a, natural, death, and, that, ghulam, ahmad, was, only, the, promised, spiritual, second, coming, and, likeness, of, jesus, the, promised, messiah, and, mahdi, he, also, claimed, to, have, appeared, in, the, likeness, of, krishna, and, that, his, advent, fulfilled, certain, prophecies, found, in, hindu, scriptures, he, stated, that, the, founder, of, sikhism, was, a, muslim, saint, who, was, a, reflection, of, the, religious, challenges, he, perceived, to, be, occurring, ghulam, ahmad, wrote, barahin, e, ahmadiyya, in, 1880, which, incorporated, indian, sufi, islamic, and, western, aspects, in, order, to, give, life, to, islam, in, the, face, of, the, british, raj, protestant, christianity, and, rising, hinduism, he, later, declared, himself, the, promised, messiah, and, the, mahdi, following, divine, revelations, in, 1891, ghulam, ahmad, argued, that, jesus, had, appeared, 1300, years, after, the, formation, of, the, muslim, community, and, stressed, the, need, for, a, current, messiah, in, turn, claiming, that, he, himself, embodied, both, the, mahdi, and, the, messiah, ghulam, ahmad, was, supported, by, muslims, who, especially, felt, oppressed, by, christian, and, hindu, missionaries, in, the, druze, faith, jesus, is, considered, the, messiah, and, one, of, god, s, important, prophets, being, among, the, seven, prophets, who, appeared, in, different, periods, of, history, according, to, the, druze, manuscripts, jesus, is, the, greatest, imam, and, the, incarnation, of, ultimate, reason, akl, on, earth, and, the, first, cosmic, principle, hadd, and, regards, jesus, and, hamza, ibn, ali, as, the, incarnations, of, one, of, the, five, great, celestial, powers, who, form, part, of, their, system, druze, doctrines, include, the, beliefs, that, jesus, was, born, of, a, virgin, named, mary, performed, miracles, and, died, by, crucifixion, in, the, druze, tradition, jesus, is, known, under, three, titles, the, true, messiah, al, masih, al, haq, the, messiah, of, all, nations, masih, al, umam, and, the, messiah, of, sinners, this, is, due, respectively, to, the, belief, that, jesus, delivered, the, true, gospel, message, the, belief, that, he, was, the, saviour, of, all, nations, and, the, belief, that, he, offers, forgiveness, druze, believe, that, hamza, ibn, ali, was, a, reincarnation, of, jesus, and, that, hamza, ibn, ali, is, the, true, messiah, who, directed, the, deeds, of, the, messiah, jesus, the, son, of, joseph, and, mary, but, when, messiah, jesus, the, son, of, joseph, and, mary, strayed, from, the, path, of, the, true, messiah, hamza, filled, the, hearts, of, the, jews, with, hatred, for, him, and, for, that, reason, they, crucified, him, according, to, the, druze, manuscripts, despite, this, hamza, ibn, ali, took, him, down, from, the, cross, and, allowed, him, to, return, to, his, family, in, order, to, prepare, men, for, the, preaching, of, his, religion
