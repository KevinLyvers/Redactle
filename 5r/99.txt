comparative, religion, is, the, branch, of, the, study, of, religions, with, the, systematic, comparison, of, the, doctrines, and, practices, themes, and, impacts, including, migration, of, the, world, s, religions, in, general, the, comparative, study, of, religion, yields, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, fundamental, philosophical, concerns, of, religion, such, as, ethics, metaphysics, and, the, nature, and, forms, of, salvation, it, also, considers, and, compares, the, origins, and, similarities, shared, between, the, various, religions, of, the, world, studying, such, material, facilitates, a, broadened, and, more, sophisticated, understanding, of, human, beliefs, and, practices, regarding, the, sacred, numinous, spiritual, and, divine, in, the, field, of, comparative, religion, a, common, geographical, classification, of, the, main, world, religions, distinguishes, groups, such, as, middle, eastern, religions, including, abrahamic, religions, and, iranian, religions, indian, religions, east, asian, religions, african, religions, american, religions, oceanic, religions, and, classical, hellenistic, religions, there, also, exist, various, sociological, classifications, of, religious, movements, al, biruni, 973, c, 1050, and, ibn, hazm, 994, 1064, both, of, the, islamic, golden, age, and, considered, as, the, fathers, of, comparative, religion, compared, the, study, of, religious, pluralism, and, their, works, have, been, significant, in, the, fields, of, theology, and, philosophy, the, persian, al, biruni, discussed, his, idea, of, history, in, the, remaining, signs, of, past, centuries, c, 1000, ad, which, was, translated, by, eduard, sachau, in, 19th, century, it, is, a, comparative, study, of, calendars, of, different, cultures, and, civilizations, interlaced, with, mathematical, astronomical, and, historical, information, exploring, the, customs, and, religions, of, different, peoples, in, the, seventeenth, century, antiquarians, such, as, athanasius, kircher, along, with, sir, thomas, browne, were, pioneering, scholars, of, comparative, religion, social, scientists, in, the, 19th, century, took, a, strong, interest, in, comparative, and, primitive, religion, through, the, work, of, max, m, ller, edward, burnett, tylor, william, robertson, smith, james, george, frazer, mile, durkheim, max, weber, and, rudolf, otto, nicholas, de, lange, professor, of, hebrew, and, jewish, studies, at, cambridge, university, says, that, the, comparative, study, of, religions, is, an, academic, discipline, which, has, been, developed, within, christian, theology, faculties, and, it, has, a, tendency, to, force, widely, differing, phenomena, into, a, kind, of, strait, jacket, cut, to, a, christian, pattern, the, problem, is, not, only, that, other, religions, may, have, little, or, nothing, to, say, about, questions, which, are, of, burning, importance, for, christianity, but, that, they, may, not, even, see, themselves, as, religions, in, precisely, the, same, way, in, which, christianity, sees, itself, as, a, religion, examples, that, demonstrate, this, point, are, buddhism, and, chinese, folk, religions, these, belief, systems, have, not, historically, been, seen, as, mutually, exclusive, and, have, blended, over, time, into, different, beliefs, such, as, pure, land, buddhism, this, shows, a, marked, difference, from, western, conceptions, of, religions, which, see, adherence, to, one, religion, as, precluding, membership, of, another, faith, hinduism, and, buddhism, provide, another, insight, in, the, form, of, soteriology, comparative, study, of, religions, may, approach, religions, with, a, base, idea, of, salvation, with, eternal, life, after, death, but, religions, like, hinduism, or, buddhism, don, t, necessarily, share, this, view, instead, hinduism, and, theravada, buddhism, both, speak, of, a, falling, back, into, nonexistence, and, escaping, the, cycle, of, reincarnation, rather, than, eternal, life, after, death, according, to, charles, joseph, adams, in, the, field, of, comparative, religion, a, common, geographical, classification, discerns, the, main, world, religions, as, follows, in, the, study, of, comparative, religion, the, category, of, abrahamic, religions, consists, of, the, three, monotheistic, religions, christianity, islam, and, judaism, which, claim, abraham, hebrew, avraham, arabic, ibrahim, as, a, part, of, their, sacred, history, smaller, religions, such, as, bah, faith, that, fit, this, description, are, sometimes, included, but, are, often, omitted, the, original, belief, in, the, god, of, abraham, eventually, became, strictly, monotheistic, present, day, rabbinic, judaism, judaism, is, considered, by, religious, jews, to, be, the, expression, of, the, covenant, that, god, established, with, the, children, of, israel, jews, hold, that, the, torah, is, part, of, the, larger, text, known, as, the, tanakh, or, the, hebrew, bible, they, also, believe, in, a, supplemental, oral, tradition, represented, by, later, texts, such, as, the, midrash, and, the, talmud, christians, believe, that, christianity, is, the, fulfillment, and, continuation, of, the, jewish, old, testament, christians, believe, that, jesus, hebrew, yeshua, is, the, awaited, messiah, christ, foretold, in, the, old, testament, prophecies, and, believe, in, subsequent, new, testament, scripture, christians, in, general, believe, that, jesus, is, the, incarnation, or, son, of, god, their, creeds, generally, hold, in, common, that, the, incarnation, ministry, suffering, death, on, the, cross, and, resurrection, of, jesus, was, for, the, salvation, of, mankind, islam, believes, the, present, christian, and, jewish, scriptures, have, been, corrupted, over, time, and, are, no, longer, the, original, divine, revelations, as, given, to, the, jewish, people, and, to, moses, jesus, and, other, prophets, for, muslims, the, quran, is, the, final, complete, revelation, from, god, arabic, allah, who, believe, it, to, have, been, revealed, to, muhammad, alone, who, is, believed, by, muslims, to, be, the, final, prophet, of, islam, and, the, khatam, an, nabiyyin, meaning, the, last, of, the, prophets, ever, sent, by, allah, seal, of, the, prophets, based, on, the, muslim, figure, of, the, mahd, the, ultimate, savior, of, humankind, and, the, final, im, m, of, the, twelve, imams, ali, muhammad, shirazi, later, known, as, bab, created, the, b, b, movement, out, of, the, belief, that, he, was, the, gate, to, the, twelfth, im, m, this, signaled, a, break, with, islam, and, started, a, new, religious, system, b, bism, however, in, the, 1860s, a, split, occurred, after, which, the, vast, majority, of, b, b, s, who, considered, mirza, husayn, ali, or, bah, u, ll, h, to, be, b, b, s, spiritual, successor, founded, the, bah, movement, while, the, minority, who, followed, subh, i, azal, came, to, be, called, azalis, the, bah, division, eventually, became, a, full, fledged, religion, of, its, own, the, bah, faith, in, comparison, to, the, other, abrahamic, religions, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, number, of, adherents, for, bah, faith, and, other, minor, abrahamic, religions, are, not, very, significant, out, of, the, three, major, abrahamic, faiths, christianity, and, judaism, are, the, two, religions, that, diverge, the, most, in, theology, and, practice, the, historical, interaction, of, islam, and, judaism, started, in, the, 7th, century, ce, with, the, origin, and, spread, of, islam, there, are, many, common, aspects, between, islam, and, judaism, and, as, islam, developed, it, gradually, became, the, major, religion, closest, to, judaism, as, opposed, to, christianity, which, originated, from, interaction, between, ancient, greek, roman, and, hebrew, cultures, judaism, is, very, similar, to, islam, in, its, fundamental, religious, outlook, structure, jurisprudence, and, practice, there, are, many, traditions, within, islam, originating, from, traditions, within, the, hebrew, bible, or, from, post, biblical, jewish, traditions, these, practices, are, known, collectively, as, the, isra, iliyat, the, historical, interaction, between, christianity, and, islam, connects, fundamental, ideas, in, christianity, with, similar, ones, in, islam, islam, accepts, many, aspects, of, christianity, as, part, of, its, faith, with, some, differences, in, interpretation, and, rejects, other, aspects, islam, believes, the, quran, is, the, final, revelation, from, god, and, a, completion, of, all, previous, revelations, including, the, bible, mandaeism, sometimes, also, known, as, sabianism, after, the, mysterious, sabians, mentioned, in, the, quran, a, name, historically, claimed, by, several, religious, groups, is, a, gnostic, and, monotheistic, religion, 4, john, the, baptist, is, their, chief, prophet, and, frequent, baptism, is, part, of, their, core, beliefs, according, to, most, scholars, mandaeism, originated, sometime, in, the, first, three, centuries, ce, in, either, southwestern, mesopotamia, or, the, syro, palestinian, area, however, some, scholars, take, the, view, that, mandaeism, is, older, and, dates, from, pre, christian, times, mandaeans, assert, that, their, religion, predates, judaism, christianity, and, islam, as, a, monotheistic, faith, mandaeans, believe, that, they, descend, directly, from, shem, noah, s, son, 182, and, also, from, john, the, baptist, s, original, disciples, several, important, religions, and, religious, movements, originated, in, greater, iran, that, is, among, speakers, of, various, iranian, languages, they, include, zoroastrianism, mithraism, ts, g, din, yazdanism, ahl, e, haqq, zurvanism, manichaeism, and, mazdakism, perhaps, one, of, the, most, important, religions, to, have, come, out, of, iran, was, zoroastrianism, while, not, properly, speaking, a, world, religion, it, became, widespread, in, the, iranian, world, especially, through, the, achaemenid, and, sasanian, empires, it, went, into, decline, alongside, many, iranian, religions, with, the, rise, of, islam, and, the, caliphates, the, religion, still, survives, today, in, small, numbers, with, a, particularly, notable, example, being, the, parsis, in, india, and, pakistan, scholars, have, often, noted, the, similarities, between, zoroastrianism, and, the, abrahamic, religions, especially, christianity, they, ve, particularly, noted, this, due, to, the, historic, relationship, between, the, jews, and, the, zoroastrian, persian, empires, as, well, as, the, relationship, between, greek, philosophy, persia, and, christianity, they, ve, debated, whether, zoroastrianism, played, an, influencing, role, on, these, religions, or, not, particular, areas, of, concern, are, a, shared, sense, of, duality, between, the, forces, of, good, and, evil, or, light, and, darkness, in, addition, to, this, there, is, a, shared, belief, in, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, as, well, as, an, emphasis, on, free, will, and, the, moral, responsibility, of, mankind, these, are, seen, by, some, as, having, influenced, the, three, major, abrahamic, faiths, as, well, as, gnosticism, and, the, bah, faith, manichaeism, is, another, iranian, faith, that, shares, many, similarities, to, zoroastrianism, in, fact, manichaeism, shares, a, belief, in, the, prophethood, of, zoroaster, while, also, maintaining, the, prophethood, of, gautama, buddha, and, jesus, christ, it, shares, a, dualist, cosmology, that, pits, good, and, light, against, evil, and, darkness, with, an, adversary, to, oppose, the, benevolent, god, manichaeism, and, mandaeism, also, share, a, common, belief, in, many, of, the, figures, and, stories, of, the, abrahamic, faiths, which, has, raised, questions, of, influences, and, origins, in, comparative, religion, indian, religions, are, all, the, religions, that, originated, in, south, asia, it, is, thought, that, the, kinship, of, the, religions, of, india, stems, from, the, fact, that, jains, buddhists, and, sikhs, look, back, to, hinduism, as, their, common, mother, al, biruni, deeply, studied, the, vedic, religions, and, through, his, works, essential, details, about, pre, 11th, century, india, s, religions, and, cultures, were, found, adi, shankaracharya, was, an, early, 8th, century, philosopher, and, theologian, who, consolidated, the, doctrine, of, advaita, vedanta, gautama, buddha, is, mentioned, as, an, avatar, of, vishnu, in, the, puranic, texts, of, hinduism, most, hindus, believe, the, buddha, accepted, and, incorporated, many, tenets, of, hinduism, in, his, doctrine, prominent, modern, hindu, reformers, such, as, mahatma, gandhi, and, vivekananda, acknowledge, buddhist, influence, like, hindus, gandhi, himself, did, not, believe, buddha, established, a, non, hindu, tradition, he, writes, i, do, not, regard, jainism, or, buddhism, as, separate, from, hinduism, a, taoic, religion, is, a, religion, or, religious, philosophy, that, focuses, on, the, east, asian, concept, of, tao, the, way, this, forms, a, large, group, of, eastern, religions, including, taoism, confucianism, jeung, san, do, shintoism, i, kuan, tao, chondogyo, and, chen, tao, in, large, parts, of, east, asia, buddhism, has, taken, on, some, taoic, features, tao, can, be, roughly, stated, to, be, the, flow, of, the, universe, or, the, force, behind, the, natural, order, it, is, believed, to, be, the, influence, that, keeps, the, universe, balanced, and, ordered, and, is, associated, with, nature, due, to, a, belief, that, nature, demonstrates, the, tao, the, flow, of, qi, as, the, essential, energy, of, action, and, existence, is, compared, to, the, universal, order, of, tao, following, the, tao, is, also, associated, with, a, proper, attitude, morality, and, lifestyle, this, is, intimately, tied, to, the, complex, concept, of, de, or, literally, virtue, or, power, de, is, the, active, expression, of, tao, taoism, and, chan, buddhism, for, centuries, had, a, mutual, influence, on, each, other, in, china, japan, korea, and, taiwan, these, influences, were, inherited, by, zen, buddhism, when, chan, buddhism, arrived, in, japan, and, adapted, as, zen, buddhism, despite, being, too, far, from, each, other, to, have, had, any, influence, some, have, historically, noted, similarities, between, traditional, chinese, religious, beliefs, and, christianity, this, was, noted, by, jesuit, missionaries, who, became, known, as, figurists, figurists, promoted, the, idea, that, the, ancient, chinese, knew, the, truth, of, christian, revelation, and, that, many, of, the, figures, described, in, chinese, texts, are, actually, figures, and, concepts, from, christianity, noted, parallels, include, shared, flood, myths, similarities, between, fuxi, and, enoch, as, well, as, parallels, between, christ, and, the, sages, there, is, also, a, noted, similarity, between, the, tao, being, the, way, as, well, as, christ, claiming, to, be, the, way, while, scholarship, rejects, this, view, today, it, was, a, notable, view, in, the, history, of, comparative, religion, these, beliefs, were, ultimately, opposed, and, disavowed, by, the, catholic, church, in, the, 18th, century, the, introduction, of, nestorian, christianity, to, china, under, the, tang, dynasty, also, led, to, increasing, similarities, between, chinese, buddhism, and, nestorian, christianity, christians, began, using, buddhist, and, taoist, concepts, to, explain, their, faith, during, this, time, the, jingjiao, documents, were, created, sometimes, called, sutras, that, demonstrated, the, blending, of, christianity, with, buddhism, the, two, also, formed, a, monastic, tradition, that, furthered, the, similarities, this, fusion, became, so, heavy, that, when, emperor, wuzong, of, the, tang, dynasty, began, persecuting, buddhists, in, the, 9th, century, he, claimed, that, christianity, was, merely, a, heresy, of, buddhism, rather, than, its, own, religion, this, equation, of, the, two, led, to, the, collapse, of, nestorian, christianity, in, china, alongside, the, persecution, of, buddhism, religious, ideologies, can, be, systematically, understood, to, have, formed, many, major, groups, with, tens, of, thousands, of, subbranches, it, is, a, form, of, cultural, evolution, that, can, be, intuitively, illustrated, with, trees, showing, historical, relationships, and, the, diversification, over, time, of, the, various, traditions, some, of, the, most, successful, have, been, those, religions, that, paired, up, with, empires, kingdoms, or, caliphates, early, in, their, history, e, g, christianity, islam, hinduism, buddhism, a, few, major, groups, of, religion, are, given, below
