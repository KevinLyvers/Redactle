unitarianism, from, latin, unitas, unity, oneness, is, a, nontrinitarian, branch, of, christianity, unitarian, christians, affirm, the, unitary, nature, of, god, as, the, singular, and, unique, creator, of, the, universe, believe, that, jesus, christ, was, inspired, by, god, in, his, moral, teachings, and, that, he, is, the, savior, of, humankind, but, he, is, not, equal, to, god, himself, accordingly, unitarians, reject, the, ecumenical, councils, and, ecumenical, creeds, and, sit, outside, traditional, main, stream, christianity, unitarianism, was, established, in, order, to, restore, primitive, christianity, before, later, corruptions, set, in, likewise, unitarian, christians, generally, reject, the, doctrine, of, original, sin, the, churchmanship, of, unitarianism, may, include, liberal, denominations, or, unitarian, christian, denominations, that, are, more, conservative, with, the, latter, being, known, as, biblical, unitarians, the, birth, of, the, unitarian, faith, is, proximate, to, the, radical, reformation, beginning, almost, simultaneously, among, the, protestant, polish, brethren, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, in, the, principality, of, transylvania, in, the, mid, 16th, century, the, first, unitarian, christian, denomination, known, to, have, emerged, during, that, time, was, the, unitarian, church, of, transylvania, founded, by, the, unitarian, preacher, and, theologian, ferenc, d, vid, c, 1520, 1579, among, its, adherents, were, a, significant, number, of, italians, who, took, refuge, in, bohemia, moravia, poland, and, transylvania, in, order, to, escape, from, the, religious, persecution, perpetrated, against, them, by, the, roman, catholic, and, magisterial, protestant, churches, in, the, 17th, century, significant, repression, in, poland, led, many, unitarians, to, flee, or, be, killed, for, their, faith, from, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, unitarians, in, britain, often, faced, significant, political, persecution, including, john, biddle, mary, wollstonecraft, and, theophilus, lindsey, in, england, the, first, unitarian, church, was, established, in, 1774, on, essex, street, london, where, today, s, british, unitarian, headquarters, is, still, located, as, is, typical, of, dissenters, and, nonconformists, unitarianism, does, not, constitute, one, single, christian, denomination, rather, it, refers, to, a, collection, of, both, existing, and, extinct, christian, groups, whether, historically, related, to, each, other, or, not, that, share, a, common, theological, concept, of, the, unitary, nature, of, god, unitarian, christian, communities, and, churches, have, developed, in, central, europe, mostly, romania, and, hungary, ireland, india, jamaica, japan, canada, nigeria, south, africa, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, in, british, america, different, schools, of, unitarian, theology, first, spread, in, the, new, england, colonies, and, subsequently, in, the, mid, atlantic, states, the, first, official, acceptance, of, the, unitarian, faith, on, the, part, of, a, congregation, in, north, america, was, by, king, s, chapel, in, boston, from, where, james, freeman, began, teaching, unitarian, doctrine, in, 1784, and, was, appointed, rector, later, in, 1785, he, created, a, revised, unitarian, book, of, common, prayer, based, on, lindsey, s, work, unitarianism, is, a, proper, noun, and, follows, the, same, english, usage, as, other, christian, theologies, that, have, developed, within, a, religious, group, or, denomination, such, as, calvinism, anabaptism, adventism, lutheranism, wesleyanism, etc, the, term, existed, shortly, before, it, became, the, name, of, a, distinct, religious, tradition, thus, occasionally, it, is, used, as, a, common, noun, to, describe, any, understanding, of, jesus, christ, that, denies, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, or, affirms, the, belief, that, god, is, only, one, person, in, that, case, it, would, be, a, nontrinitarian, belief, system, not, necessarily, associated, with, the, unitarian, movement, for, example, the, unitarian, movement, has, never, accepted, the, godhood, of, jesus, and, therefore, does, not, include, those, nontrinitarian, belief, systems, that, do, such, as, oneness, pentecostalism, united, pentecostal, church, international, the, true, jesus, church, and, the, writings, of, michael, servetus, all, of, which, maintain, that, jesus, is, god, as, a, single, person, recently, some, religious, groups, have, adopted, the, 19th, century, term, biblical, unitarianism, to, distinguish, their, theologies, from, unitarianism, unitarianism, is, a, christian, theology, and, practice, that, precedes, and, is, distinct, from, unitarian, universalism, in, the, 1890s, the, american, unitarian, association, began, to, allow, non, christian, and, non, theistic, churches, and, individuals, to, be, part, of, their, fellowship, as, a, result, people, who, held, no, unitarian, belief, began, to, be, called, unitarians, because, they, were, members, of, churches, that, belonged, to, the, american, unitarian, association, after, several, decades, the, non, theistic, members, outnumbered, the, theological, unitarians, unitarianism, both, as, a, theology, and, as, a, denominational, family, of, churches, was, defined, and, developed, in, poland, transylvania, england, wales, india, japan, jamaica, the, united, states, and, beyond, in, the, 16th, century, through, the, present, although, common, beliefs, existed, among, unitarians, in, each, of, these, regions, they, initially, grew, independently, from, each, other, only, later, did, they, influence, one, another, and, accumulate, more, similarities, the, ecclesia, minor, or, minor, reformed, church, of, poland, better, known, today, as, the, polish, brethren, was, born, as, the, result, of, a, controversy, that, started, on, january, 22, 1556, when, piotr, of, goni, dz, peter, gonesius, a, polish, student, spoke, out, against, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, during, the, general, synod, of, the, reformed, calvinist, churches, of, poland, held, in, the, village, of, secemin, after, nine, years, of, debate, in, 1565, the, anti, trinitarians, were, excluded, from, the, existing, synod, of, the, polish, reformed, church, henceforth, the, ecclesia, maior, and, they, began, to, hold, their, own, synods, as, the, ecclesia, minor, though, frequently, called, arians, by, those, on, the, outside, the, views, of, fausto, sozzini, faustus, socinus, became, the, standard, in, the, church, and, these, doctrines, were, quite, removed, from, arianism, so, important, was, socinus, to, the, formulation, of, their, beliefs, that, those, outside, poland, usually, referred, to, them, as, socinians, the, polish, brethren, were, disbanded, in, 1658, by, the, sejm, polish, parliament, they, were, ordered, to, convert, to, roman, catholicism, or, leave, poland, most, of, them, went, to, transylvania, or, holland, where, they, embraced, the, name, unitarian, between, 1665, and, 1668, a, grandson, of, socinus, andrzej, wiszowaty, sr, published, bibliotheca, fratrum, polonorum, quos, unitarios, vocant, library, of, the, polish, brethren, who, are, called, unitarians, 4, vols, 1665, 1669, the, unitarian, church, in, transylvania, was, first, recognized, by, the, edict, of, torda, issued, by, the, transylvanian, diet, under, prince, john, ii, sigismund, z, polya, january, 1568, and, was, first, led, by, ferenc, d, vid, a, former, calvinist, bishop, who, had, begun, preaching, the, new, doctrine, in, 1566, the, term, unitarian, first, appeared, as, unitaria, religio, in, a, document, of, the, diet, of, l, cfalva, transylvania, on, 25, october, 1600, though, it, was, not, widely, used, in, transylvania, until, 1638, when, the, formal, recepta, unitaria, religio, was, published, the, word, unitarian, had, been, circulating, in, private, letters, in, england, in, reference, to, imported, copies, of, such, publications, as, the, library, of, the, polish, brethren, who, are, called, unitarians, 1665, henry, hedworth, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, unitarian, in, print, in, english, 1673, and, the, word, first, appears, in, a, title, in, stephen, nye, s, a, brief, history, of, the, unitarians, called, also, socinians, 1687, the, movement, gained, popularity, in, england, in, the, wake, of, the, enlightenment, and, began, to, become, a, formal, denomination, in, 1774, when, theophilus, lindsey, organised, meetings, with, joseph, priestley, founding, the, first, avowedly, unitarian, congregation, in, the, country, this, occurred, at, essex, street, church, in, london, official, toleration, came, in, 1813, the, first, official, acceptance, of, the, unitarian, faith, on, the, part, of, a, congregation, in, america, was, by, king, s, chapel, in, boston, which, settled, james, freeman, 1759, 1835, in, 1782, and, revised, the, prayer, book, into, a, mild, unitarian, liturgy, in, 1785, in, 1800, joseph, stevens, buckminster, became, minister, of, the, brattle, street, church, in, boston, where, his, brilliant, sermons, literary, activities, and, academic, attention, to, the, german, new, criticism, helped, shape, the, subsequent, growth, of, unitarianism, in, new, england, unitarian, henry, ware, 1764, 1845, was, appointed, as, the, hollis, professor, of, divinity, at, harvard, college, in, 1805, harvard, divinity, school, then, shifted, from, its, conservative, roots, to, teach, unitarian, theology, see, harvard, and, unitarianism, buckminster, s, close, associate, william, ellery, channing, 1780, 1842, was, settled, over, the, federal, street, church, in, boston, 1803, and, in, a, few, years, he, became, the, leader, of, the, unitarian, movement, a, theological, battle, with, the, congregational, churches, resulted, in, the, formation, of, the, american, unitarian, association, at, boston, in, 1825, certainly, the, unitarian, theology, was, being, adopted, by, the, congregationalists, from, the, 1820s, onwards, this, movement, is, also, evident, in, england, at, this, time, the, first, school, founded, by, the, unitarians, in, the, united, states, was, the, clinton, liberal, institute, in, clinton, oneida, county, new, york, founded, in, 1831, unitarians, charge, that, the, trinity, unlike, unitarianism, fails, to, adhere, to, strict, monotheism, unitarians, maintain, that, jesus, was, a, great, man, and, a, prophet, of, god, perhaps, even, a, supernatural, being, but, not, god, himself, they, believe, jesus, did, not, claim, to, be, god, and, that, his, teachings, did, not, suggest, the, existence, of, a, triune, god, unitarian, christology, can, be, divided, according, to, whether, or, not, jesus, is, believed, to, have, had, a, pre, human, existence, both, forms, maintain, that, god, is, one, being, and, one, person, and, that, jesus, is, the, or, a, son, of, god, but, generally, not, god, himself, in, the, early, 19th, century, unitarian, robert, wallace, identified, three, particular, classes, of, unitarian, doctrines, in, history, unitarianism, is, considered, a, factor, in, the, decline, of, classical, deism, because, there, were, people, who, increasingly, preferred, to, identify, themselves, as, unitarians, rather, than, deists, several, tenets, of, unitarianism, overlap, with, the, predominant, muslim, view, of, jesus, and, islamic, understanding, of, monotheism, the, christology, commonly, called, socinian, after, fausto, sozzini, one, of, the, founders, of, unitarian, theology, refers, to, the, belief, that, jesus, christ, began, his, life, when, he, was, born, as, a, human, in, other, words, the, teaching, that, jesus, pre, existed, his, human, body, is, rejected, there, are, various, views, ranging, from, the, belief, that, jesus, was, simply, a, human, psilanthropism, who, because, of, his, greatness, was, adopted, by, god, as, his, son, adoptionism, to, the, belief, that, jesus, literally, became, the, son, of, god, when, he, was, conceived, by, the, holy, spirit, this, christology, existed, in, some, form, or, another, prior, to, sozzini, theodotus, of, byzantium, artemon, and, paul, of, samosata, denied, the, pre, existence, of, christ, these, ideas, were, continued, by, marcellus, of, ancyra, and, his, pupil, photinus, in, the, 4th, century, ad, in, the, radical, reformation, and, anabaptist, movements, of, the, 16th, century, this, idea, resurfaced, with, sozzini, s, uncle, lelio, sozzini, having, influenced, the, polish, brethren, to, a, formal, declaration, of, this, belief, in, the, racovian, catechism, fausto, sozzini, involuntarily, ended, up, giving, his, name, to, this, christological, position, which, continued, with, english, unitarians, such, as, john, biddle, thomas, belsham, theophilus, lindsey, and, james, martineau, in, america, most, of, the, early, unitarians, were, arian, in, christology, see, below, but, among, those, who, held, to, a, socinian, view, was, james, freeman, regarding, the, virgin, birth, of, jesus, among, those, who, denied, the, preexistence, of, christ, some, held, to, it, and, others, did, not, its, denial, is, sometimes, ascribed, to, the, ebionites, however, origen, contra, celsum, v, 61, and, eusebius, he, iii, 27, both, indicate, that, some, ebionites, did, accept, the, virgin, birth, on, the, other, hand, theodotus, of, byzantium, artemon, and, paul, of, samosata, all, accepted, the, virgin, birth, in, the, early, days, of, unitarianism, the, stories, of, the, virgin, birth, were, accepted, by, most, there, were, a, number, of, unitarians, who, questioned, the, historical, accuracy, of, the, bible, including, symon, budny, jacob, palaeologus, thomas, belsham, and, richard, wright, and, this, made, them, question, the, virgin, birth, story, beginning, in, england, and, america, in, the, 1830s, and, manifesting, itself, primarily, in, transcendentalist, unitarianism, which, emerged, from, the, german, liberal, theology, associated, primarily, with, friedrich, schleiermacher, the, psilanthropist, view, increased, in, popularity, its, proponents, took, an, intellectual, and, humanistic, approach, to, religion, they, embraced, evolutionary, concepts, asserted, the, inherent, goodness, of, man, and, abandoned, the, doctrine, of, biblical, infallibility, rejecting, most, of, the, miraculous, events, in, the, bible, including, the, virgin, birth, notable, examples, are, james, martineau, theodore, parker, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, frederic, henry, hedge, famous, american, unitarian, william, ellery, channing, was, a, believer, in, the, virgin, birth, until, later, in, his, life, after, he, had, begun, his, association, with, the, transcendentalists, arianism, is, often, considered, a, form, of, unitarianism, the, christology, of, arianism, holds, that, jesus, before, his, human, life, existed, as, the, logos, or, the, word, a, being, begotten, or, created, by, god, who, dwelt, with, god, in, heaven, there, are, many, varieties, of, this, form, of, unitarianism, ranging, from, the, belief, that, the, son, was, a, divine, spirit, of, the, same, substance, called, subordinationism, or, of, a, similar, substance, to, that, of, god, called, semi, arianism, to, the, belief, that, he, was, an, angel, or, other, lesser, spirit, creature, of, a, wholly, different, nature, from, god, not, all, of, these, views, necessarily, were, held, by, arius, the, namesake, of, this, christology, it, is, still, nontrinitarian, because, according, to, this, belief, system, jesus, has, always, been, beneath, god, though, higher, than, humans, arian, christology, was, not, a, majority, view, among, unitarians, in, poland, transylvania, or, england, it, was, only, with, the, advent, of, american, unitarianism, that, it, gained, a, foothold, in, the, unitarian, movement, among, early, christian, theologians, who, believed, in, a, pre, existent, jesus, who, was, subordinate, to, god, the, father, were, lucian, of, antioch, eusebius, of, caesarea, arius, eusebius, of, nicomedia, asterius, the, sophist, eunomius, and, ulfilas, as, well, as, felix, bishop, of, urgell, proponents, of, this, christology, also, associate, it, more, controversially, with, justin, martyr, and, hippolytus, of, rome, antitrinitarian, michael, servetus, did, not, deny, the, pre, existence, of, christ, so, he, may, have, believed, in, it, in, his, treatise, concerning, the, divine, trinity, servetus, taught, that, the, logos, word, was, the, reflection, of, christ, and, that, reflection, of, christ, was, the, word, with, god, that, consisted, of, god, himself, shining, brightly, in, heaven, and, it, was, god, himself, and, that, the, word, was, the, very, essence, of, god, or, the, manifestation, of, god, s, essence, and, there, was, in, god, no, other, substance, or, hypostasis, than, his, word, in, a, bright, cloud, where, god, then, seemed, to, subsist, and, in, that, very, spot, the, face, and, personality, of, christ, shone, bright, isaac, newton, had, arian, beliefs, as, well, famous, 19th, century, arian, unitarians, include, andrews, norton, and, william, ellery, channing, in, his, earlier, years, although, there, is, no, specific, authority, on, convictions, of, unitarian, belief, aside, from, rejection, of, the, trinity, the, following, beliefs, are, generally, accepted, in, 1938, the, christian, leader, attributed, the, religion, of, jesus, not, a, religion, about, jesus, to, unitarians, though, the, phrase, was, used, earlier, by, congregationalist, rollin, lynde, hartt, in, 1924, worship, within, the, unitarian, tradition, accommodates, a, wide, range, of, understandings, of, god, while, the, focus, of, the, service, may, be, simply, the, celebration, of, life, itself, each, unitarian, congregation, is, at, liberty, to, devise, its, own, form, of, worship, though, commonly, unitarians, will, light, their, chalice, symbol, of, faith, have, a, story, for, all, ages, and, include, sermons, prayers, hymns, and, songs, some, will, allow, attendees, to, publicly, share, their, recent, joys, or, concerns, this, section, relates, to, unitarian, churches, and, organizations, today, which, are, still, specifically, christian,
