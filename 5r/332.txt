the, order, of, the, universe, and, human, survival, the, aztecs, viewed, people, as, servants, and, warriors, of, the, gods, whom, were, not, merciful, or, generous, but, all, powerful, beings, that, needed, to, be, fed, and, appeased, in, order, to, avoid, disaster, and, punishment, thus, the, concept, of, human, sacrifice, emerged, this, practice, was, not, new, and, had, been, used, in, other, cultures, such, as, the, mayans, but, the, aztecs, made, this, their, main, event, so, to, speak, in, their, ceremonies, these, sacrifices, were, mainly, to, appease, the, sun, god, according, to, the, aztecs, the, creation, of, the, earth, started, with, a, god, called, ometeotl, otherwise, known, as, the, dual, god, as, they, were, made, from, the, union, of, tonacatecuhtli, and, tonacacihuatl, whom, the, aztecs, believed, were, the, lord, and, lady, of, their, sustenance, tonacatecuhtli, and, tonacacihuatl, had, four, children, xipe, totec, which, translates, to, the, flayed, god, in, nahuatl, is, associated, with, the, color, red, he, is, the, god, of, the, seasons, and, all, things, that, grow, on, the, earth, tezcatlipoca, which, translates, to, smoking, mirror, is, associated, with, the, color, black, he, is, the, god, of, the, earth, and, the, most, powerful, of, the, four, children, quetzalcoatl, which, translates, to, plumed, serpent, is, associated, with, the, color, white, he, is, the, god, of, air, finally, huitzilopochtli, which, translates, to, hummingbird, of, the, south, is, associated, with, the, color, blue, he, is, the, god, of, war, the, four, children, decided, they, wanted, to, create, a, world, with, people, to, live, in, it, quetzalcoatl, and, huitzilopochtli, made, the, first, attempt, starting, by, making, fire, this, fire, became, the, sun, but, only, half, a, sun, because, it, was, not, big, or, bright, enough, to, light, their, entire, world, they, then, made, the, first, man, and, woman, which, they, called, cipactonal, and, oxomoco, respectively, their, many, children, were, called, macehuales, and, were, to, be, the, farmers, of, the, land, from, there, they, created, time, and, then, the, underworld, known, as, there, are, many, stories, of, how, the, age, of, the, fifth, and, final, sun, came, to, be, one, story, tells, of, how, tezcatlipoca, took, flint, and, used, it, to, make, fires, to, light, the, world, again, before, discussing, with, his, brothers, what, should, be, done, they, decided, to, make, a, new, sun, that, feeds, on, the, hearts, and, blood, of, humans, to, feed, it, they, made, four, hundred, men, and, five, women, this, is, where, the, story, goes, into, different, directions, some, say, that, both, quetzalcoatl, and, tlaloc, wanted, their, sons, to, become, the, new, sun, so, they, each, threw, their, sons, into, one, of, the, fires, created, by, tezcatlipoca, tlaloc, waited, for, the, fire, to, burn, out, before, throwing, his, son, into, the, embers, so, his, son, became, the, moon, quetzalcoatl, elected, to, throw, his, son, directly, into, the, fiery, blaze, so, he, became, the, fifth, and, final, sun, that, we, see, in, the, sky, today, another, story, tells, of, the, gathering, of, the, gods, at, the, ancient, city, of, teotihuacan, to, discuss, how, to, make, a, new, sun, a, god, by, the, name, of, nanahuatzin, god, of, disease, offered, to, throw, himself, into, the, fire, and, become, the, new, sun, being, a, weak, and, sickly, god, the, others, thought, he, should, not, be, the, one, to, do, it, and, that, a, stronger, and, more, powerful, god, should, be, the, sun, tecuciztecatl, a, very, wealthy, god, stepped, forward, and, said, he, would, do, it, but, was, not, able, to, find, the, courage, to, jump, into, the, flames, nanahuatzin, with, little, hesitation, then, threw, himself, into, the, fire, seeing, his, bravery, tecuciztecatl, decided, to, jump, in, too, they, were, both, transformed, into, suns, but, the, light, was, now, too, bright, to, see, anything, so, one, of, the, other, gods, threw, a, rabbit, at, tecuciztecatl, dimming, his, light, and, turning, him, into, the, moon, nanahuatzin, now, the, new, sun, was, essentially, reborn, as, ollin, tonatiuh, the, problem, they, now, had, was, that, he, would, not, move, from, his, position, in, the, sky, unless, the, other, gods, sacrificed, their, blood, for, him, so, a, god, by, the, name, of, tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, lord, of, dawn, threw, a, dart, at, tonatiuh, but, missed, tonatiuh, then, threw, one, back, at, tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, hitting, him, in, the, head, and, turning, him, into, itzlacoliuhqui, god, of, coldness, frost, and, obsidian, realizing, that, they, could, not, refuse, the, other, gods, offered, their, bare, chests, to, him, and, quetzalcoatl, cut, out, their, hearts, with, a, sacrificial, knife, with, the, blood, of, the, gods, tonatiuh, began, to, move, across, the, sky, in, the, same, pattern, that, we, see, to, this, day, quetzalcoatl, took, the, clothing, and, ornaments, of, the, sacrificed, gods, and, wrapped, them, in, bundles, which, the, people, then, worshipped
