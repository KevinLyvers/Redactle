the, yayoi, district, of, the, japanese, capital, tokyo, is, the, namesake, of, the, yayoi, period, because, archaeologists, discovered, pottery, associated, with, the, time, period, there, contact,

begins, with, the, appearance, of, the, first, generation, of, gods, who, appeared, out, of, primordial, oil, a, trio, of, gods, who, produced, the, next, seven, generations, of, gods, izanagi, and, izanami, were, eventually, born, siblings, and, using, a, naginata, decorated, with, jewels, named, ame, no, nuhoko, heavenly, jeweled, spear, that, was, gifted, to, them, izanagi, created, the, first, islands, of, the, japanese, archipelago, by, dipping, the, naginata, into, the, primordial, waters, historians, have, interpreted, the, myth, of, izanagi, s, creation, of, the, first, japanese, island, onogoro, as, an, early, example, of, phallocentrism, in, japanese, mythology, the, earliest, creation, myths, of, japanese, mythology, generally, involve, topics, such, as, death, decay, loss, infanticide, and, contamination, the, creation, myths, place, great, importance, on, purification, ceremonial, order, and, the, masculine, for, example, the, first, child, born, to, izanagi, and, izanami, after, they, attempt, a, union, ceremony, is, born, with, no, limbs, or, bones, and, the, parents, discard, the, child, by, sending, him, to, sea, in, a, boat, when, izanagi, and, izanami, ask, the, older, gods, why, their, child, was, born, without, bones, or, limbs, they, are, told, it, was, because, they, did, not, conduct, the, ceremony, properly, and, that, the, male, must, always, speak, before, the, female, once, they, follow, the, directions, of, the, older, gods, correctly, they, produce, many, children, many, of, whom, are, the, islands, of, the, japanese, archipelago, among, their, children, are, the, yashima, or, the, eight, great, islands, of, japan, awaji, iyo, oki, tsukushi, iki, tsushima, sado, and, yamato, the, last, child, that, izanami, produces, is, a, fire, god, kagutsuchi, incarnation, of, fire, whose, flames, kill, her, and, izanagi, murders, the, child, in, grief, driven, anger, the, child, s, corpse, creates, even, more, gods, izanami, was, then, buried, on, mount, hiba, at, the, border, of, the, old, provinces, of, izumo, and, hoki, near, modern, day, yasugi, of, shimane, prefecture, scholars, of, japanese, mythology, have, noted, the, incestuous, themes, of, the, creation, myth, as, represented, in, the, kojiki, and, the, first, scholar, to, write, about, izanagi, and, izanami, as, siblings, was, oka, masao, izanami, is, referred, to, in, the, kojiki, as, izanagi, s, imo, meaning, both, wife, or, little, sister, in, japanese, and, other, scholars, dispute, that, the, pair, were, siblings, hattori, asake, another, scholar, argued, that, oka, was, correct, because, he, drew, evidence, from, another, myth, about, humans, who, had, incestuous, relations, because, of, a, great, flood, wiping, out, the, rest, of, the, human, population, essentially, hattori, said, the, myth, oka, used, as, evidence, was, too, different, to, be, the, origin, of, the, izanagi, and, izanami, myth, in, the, man, y, sh, izanami, is, also, referred, to, as, imo, by, the, compiler, suggesting, that, the, compiler, believed, that, izanami, was, izanagi, s, sister, while, scholars, disagree, about, the, nature, of, izanami, and, izanagi, s, relationships, the, gods, amaterasu, and, susanoo, children, of, izanagi, were, sibling, gods, who, created, children, together, in, a, contest, preceding, susanoo, s, desecration, of, amaterasu, s, home, which, leads, to, her, hiding, in, a, cave, a, unique, aspect, of, japanese, mythology, is, its, inclusion, of, graphic, details, with, disgusting, and, horrific, images, that, are, considered, to, be, taboo, in, modern, japanese, society, which, has, many, cultural, practices, associated, with, purification, and, cleanliness, after, izanami, s, death, the, myth, of, izanagi, s, efforts, to, rescue, her, from, yomi, an, underworld, described, in, japanese, mythology, explains, the, origins, of, the, cycle, of, birth, and, death, after, killing, their, child, kagutsuchi, izanagi, was, still, grief, stricken, so, he, undertook, the, task, of, finding, a, way, to, bring, izanami, back, from, the, dead, after, finally, locating, her, he, disobeyed, her, order, to, not, look, at, her, while, she, went, to, ask, permission, to, leave, yomi, he, used, his, hair, to, create, a, flame, and, when, he, gazed, at, izanami, s, rotting, maggot, filled, flesh, he, fled, in, fear, and, disgust, izanami, felt, betrayed, and, tried, to, capture, him, but, he, escaped, by, creating, obstacles, for, izanami, s, horde, of, shikome, including, using, peaches, to, threaten, them, the, myth, of, izanagi, s, journey, into, yomi, features, many, themes, of, food, he, creates, grapes, to, distract, the, shikome, who, stop, to, eat, them, granting, him, time, to, escape, the, peaches, he, uses, to, scare, the, shikome, off, are, then, blessed, and, peaches, appear, in, many, other, japanese, myths, especially, the, tale, of, momotar, the, peach, boy, the, origins, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, are, accounted, for, in, japanese, mythology, through, the, myth, of, izanagi, s, return, from, yomi, after, spending, so, much, time, in, yomi, izanagi, cleansed, himself, with, a, purification, ceremony, as, izanagi, cleansed, himself, the, water, and, robes, that, fell, from, his, body, created, many, more, gods, purification, rituals, still, function, as, important, traditions, in, japan, today, from, shoe, etiquette, in, households, to, sumo, wrestling, purification, ceremonies, amaterasu, the, sun, goddess, and, divine, ancestor, of, the, first, emperor, jimmu, was, born, from, izanagi, s, eye, the, moon, god, and, susanoo, the, storm, god, were, born, at, the, same, time, as, amaterasu, when, izanagi, washed, his, face, myths, related, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, storm, kami, are, full, of, strife, and, conflict, the, sun, goddess, and, her, sibling, the, moon, god, s, interpersonal, conflicts, explain, in, japanese, myth, why, the, sun, and, the, moon, do, not, stay, in, the, sky, at, the, same, time, their, distaste, for, one, another, keeps, them, both, turning, away, from, the, other, meanwhile, the, sun, goddess, and, the, storm, god, susanoo, s, conflicts, were, intense, and, bloody, various, accounts, of, susanoo, s, temper, tantrum, in, amaterasu, s, home, depict, a, variety, of, disgusting, and, brutal, behaviors, everything, from, smearing, his, feces, across, her, home, s, walls, to, skinning, her, favorite, horse, alive, and, throwing, it, at, her, maid, and, killing, the, maid, but, it, is, usually, in, depictions, of, this, particular, myth, susanoo, s, behavior, that, scares, amaterasu, into, hiding, in, a, cave, it, would, take, the, combined, efforts, of, many, other, kami, and, the, erotic, dance, of, a, particular, goddess, named, ame, no, uzume, to, lure, amaterasu, from, the, cave, again, ame, no, uzume, exposed, herself, while, dancing, and, created, such, commotion, that, amaterasu, peeked, out, from, her, cave, the, myth, of, amaterasu, s, entering, and, emerging, from, a, cave, is, depicted, in, one, of, the, most, iconic, images, of, japanese, mythology, which, is, shown, to, the, right, the, sun, goddess, amaterasu, s, importance, in, japanese, mythology, is, two, fold, she, is, the, sun, and, one, of, izanagi, s, most, beloved, of, children, as, well, as, the, ancestor, of, the, japanese, imperial, line, according, to, legend, her, status, as, a, sun, goddess, had, political, ramifications, for, the, imperial, family, and, the, yamato, state, most, likely, benefited, from, the, myth, when, dealing, with, korean, influences, because, korea, also, had, myths, of, sun, god, ancestors, for, the, korean, imperial, family, the, tale, of, first, emperor, jimmu, is, considered, the, origin, of, the, imperial, family, emperor, jimmu, is, considered, to, be, the, human, descendant, of, amaterasu, the, sun, goddess, his, ascension, to, the, throne, marked, the, transition,

to, 660, b, c, at, the, end, of, the, seventh, century, the, imperial, court, finally, moved, from, where, emperor, jimmu, was, said, to, have, founded, it, in, yamato, the, importance, of, this, myth, in, particular, is, that, it, establishes, the, origins, and, the, power, of, the, japanese, imperial, family, as, divine, although, some, scholars, believe, that, the, myths, found, in, the, nihon, shoki, and, kojiki, are, meant, to, give, authority, to, the, imperial, family, others, suggest, that, the, myths, in, the, nihon, shoki, and, kojiki, are, unique, accounts, meant, to, give, authority, to, the, mythic, histories, in, themselves, the, nihon, shoki, and, kojiki, have, varying, accounts, of, the, mythic, history, of, japan, and, there, are, differences, in, the, details, of,
