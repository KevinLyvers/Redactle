humanistic, or, rationalistic, religion, theory, of, government, or, way, of, life, confucianism, developed, from, teachings, of, the, chinese, philosopher, confucius, 551, 479, bce, during, a, time, that, was, later, referred, to, as, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, era, confucius, considered, himself, a, transmitter, of, cultural, values, inherited, from, the, xia, c, 2070, 1600, bce, shang, c, 1600, 1046, bce, and, western, zhou, c, 1046, 771, bce, dynasties, confucianism, was, suppressed, during, the, legalist, and, autocratic, qin, dynasty, 221, 206, bce, but, survived, during, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce, confucian, approaches, edged, out, the, proto, taoist, huang, lao, as, the, official, ideology, while, the, emperors, mixed, both, with, the, realist, techniques, of, legalism, confucianism, regards, principles, contained, in, the, five, classics, the, key, tenets, that, should, be, followed, to, promote, the, harmony, of, the, family, and, the, society, as, a, whole, a, confucian, revival, began, during, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ce, in, the, late, tang, confucianism, further, developed, in, response, to, the, increasing, influence, of, buddhism, and, taoism, and, was, reformulated, as, neo, confucianism, this, reinvigorated, form, was, adopted, as, the, basis, of, the, imperial, exams, and, the, core, philosophy, of, the, scholar, official, class, in, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1297, the, abolition, of, the, examination, system, in, 1905, marked, the, end, of, official, confucianism, the, intellectuals, of, the, new, culture, movement, of, the, early, twentieth, century, blamed, confucianism, for, china, s, weaknesses, they, searched, for, new, doctrines, to, replace, confucian, teachings, some, of, these, new, ideologies, include, the, three, principles, of, the, people, with, the, establishment, of, the, republic, of, china, and, then, maoism, under, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, the, late, twentieth, century, the, confucian, work, ethic, has, been, credited, with, the, rise, of, the, east, asian, economy, with, particular, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, the, family, and, social, harmony, rather, than, on, an, otherworldly, source, of, spiritual, values, the, core, of, confucianism, is, humanistic, according, to, american, philosopher, herbert, fingarette, s, conceptualisation, of, confucianism, as, a, philosophical, system, which, regards, the, secular, as, sacred, confucianism, transcends, the, dichotomy, between, religion, and, humanism, considering, the, ordinary, activities, of, human, life, and, especially, human, relationships, as, a, manifestation, of, the, sacred, because, they, are, the, expression, of, humanity, s, moral, nature, x, ng, which, has, a, transcendent, anchorage, in, tian, ti, n, heaven, while, the, confucian, concept, of, tian, shares, some, similarities, with, the, concept, of, a, deity, it, is, primarily, an, impersonal, absolute, principle, like, the, tao, or, the, brahman, most, scholars, and, practitioners, do, not, think, of, tian, as, a, god, and, the, deities, that, many, confucians, worship, do, not, originate, from, orthodox, confucianism, confucianism, focuses, on, the, practical, order, that, is, given, by, a, this, worldly, awareness, of, tian, the, worldly, concern, of, confucianism, rests, upon, the, belief, that, human, beings, are, fundamentally, good, and, teachable, improvable, and, perfectible, through, personal, and, communal, endeavor, especially, self, cultivation, and, self, creation, confucian, thought, focuses, on, the, cultivation, of, virtue, in, a, morally, organised, world, some, of, the, basic, confucian, ethical, concepts, and, practices, include, ren, yi, li, and, zhi, ren, is, the, essence, of, the, human, being, which, manifests, as, compassion, it, is, the, virtue, form, of, heaven, yi, is, the, upholding, of, righteousness, and, the, moral, disposition, to, do, good, li, is, a, system, of, ritual, norms, and, propriety, that, determines, how, a, person, should, properly, act, in, everyday, life, in, harmony, with, the, law, of, heaven, zhi, zh, is, the, ability, to, see, what, is, right, and, fair, or, the, converse, in, the, behaviors, exhibited, by, others, confucianism, holds, one, in, contempt, either, passively, or, actively, for, failure, to, uphold, the, cardinal, moral, values, of, ren, and, yi, traditionally, cultures, and, countries, in, the, chinese, cultural, sphere, are, strongly, influenced, by, confucianism, including, china, taiwan, korea, japan, and, vietnam, as, well, as, various, territories, settled, predominantly, by, han, chinese, people, such, as, singapore, and, myanmar, s, kokang, today, it, has, been, credited, for, shaping, east, asian, societies, and, overseas, chinese, communities, and, to, some, extent, other, parts, of, asia, most, confucianist, movements, have, had, significant, differences, from, the, original, zhou, era, teachings, and, are, typically, much, more, complex, because, of, their, reliance, on, elaborate, doctrine, and, other, factors, such, as, traditions, with, long, histories, in, the, past, few, decades, there, have, been, talks, of, a, confucian, revival, in, the, academic, and, the, scholarly, community, and, there, has, been, a, grassroots, proliferation, of, various, types, of, confucian, churches, in, late, 2015, many, confucian, personalities, formally, established, a, national, confucian, church, k, ngsh, nghu, in, china, to, unify, the, many, confucian, congregations, and, civil, society, organisations, strictly, speaking, there, is, no, term, in, chinese, which, directly, corresponds, to, confucianism, the, closest, catch, all, term, for, things, related, to, confucianism, is, the, word, ru, r, its, literal, meanings, in, modern, chinese, include, scholar, learned, or, refined, man, in, old, chinese, the, word, had, a, distinct, set, of, meanings, including, to, tame, to, mould, to, educate, and, to, refine, 190, 197, several, different, terms, some, of, which, with, modern, origin, are, used, in, different, situations, to, express, different, facets, of, confucianism, including, three, of, them, use, ru, these, names, do, not, use, the, name, confucius, at, all, but, instead, focus, on, the, ideal, of, the, confucian, man, the, use, of, the, term, confucianism, has, been, avoided, by, some, modern, scholars, who, favor, ruism, and, ruists, instead, robert, eno, argues, that, the, term, has, been, burdened, with, the, ambiguities, and, irrelevant, traditional, associations, ruism, as, he, states, is, more, faithful, to, the, original, chinese, name, for, the, school, 7, the, term, traditionalist, has, been, suggested, by, david, schaberg, to, emphasize, the, connection, to, the, past, its, standards, and, inherited, forms, in, which, confucius, himself, placed, so, much, importance, this, translation, of, the, word, ru, is, followed, by, e, g, yuri, pines, according, to, zhou, youguang, ru, originally, referred, to, shamanic, methods, of, holding, rites, and, existed, before, confucius, s, times, but, with, confucius, it, came, to, mean, devotion, to, propagating, such, teachings, to, bring, civilisation, to, the, people, confucianism, was, initiated, by, the, disciples, of, confucius, developed, by, mencius, c, 372, 289, bce, and, inherited, by, later, generations, undergoing, constant, transformations, and, restructuring, since, its, establishment, but, preserving, the, principles, of, humaneness, and, righteousness, at, its, core, in, the, western, world, the, character, for, water, is, often, used, as, a, symbol, for, confucianism, which, is, not, the, case, in, modern, china, however, the, five, phases, were, used, as, important, symbols, representing, leadership, in, han, dynasty, thought, including, confucianist, works, traditionally, confucius, was, thought, to, be, the, author, or, editor, of, the, five, classics, which, were, the, basic, texts, of, confucianism, all, edited, into, their, received, versions, around, 500, years, later, by, imperial, librarian, liu, xin, 51, the, scholar, yao, xinzhong, allows, that, there, are, good, reasons, to, believe, that, confucian, classics, took, shape, in, the, hands, of, confucius, but, that, nothing, can, be, taken, for, granted, in, the, matter, of, the, early, versions, of, the, classics, yao, suggests, that, most, modern, scholars, hold, the, pragmatic, view, that, confucius, and, his, followers, did, not, intend, to, create, a, system, of, classics, but, nonetheless, contributed, to, their, formation, the, scholar, tu, weiming, explains, these, classics, as, embodying, five, visions, which, underlie, the, development, of, confucianism, confucianism, revolves, around, the, pursuit, of, the, unity, of, the, individual, self, and, tian, heaven, to, put, it, another, way, it, focuses, on, the, relationship, between, humanity, and, heaven, the, principle, or, way, of, heaven, tian, li, or, tian, tao, is, the, order, of, the, world, and, the, source, of, divine, authority, tian, li, or, tian, tao, is, monistic, meaning, that, it, is, singular, and, indivisible, individuals, may, realise, their, humanity, and, become, one, with, heaven, through, the, contemplation, of, such, order, this, transformation, of, the, self, may, be, extended, to, the, family, and, society, to, create, a, harmonious, community, jo, l, thoraval, studied, confucianism, as, a, diffused, civil, religion, in, contemporary, china, finding, that, it, expresses, itself, in, the, widespread, worship, of, five, cosmological, entities, heaven, and, earth, d, the, sovereign, or, the, government, j, n, ancestors, q, n, and, masters, sh, according, to, the, scholar, stephan, feuchtwang, in, chinese, cosmology, which, is, not, merely, confucian, but, shared, by, many, chinese, religions, the, universe, creates, itself, out, of, a, primary, chaos, of, material, energy, hundun, and, qi, and, is, organized, through, the, polarity, of, yin, and, yang, that, characterises, any, thing, and, life, creation, is, therefore, a, continuous, ordering, it, is, not, creation, ex, nihilo, yin, and, yang, are, the, invisible, and, visible, the, receptive, and, the, active, the, unshaped, and, the, shaped, they, characterise, the, yearly, cycle, winter, and, summer, the, landscape, shady, and, bright, the, sexes, female, and, male, and, even, sociopolitical, history, disorder, and, order, confucianism, is, concerned, with, finding, middle, ways, between, yin, and, yang, at, every, new, configuration, of, the, world, confucianism, conciliates, both, the, inner, and, outer, polarities, of, spiritual, cultivation, that, is, to, say, self, cultivation, and, world, redemption, synthesised, in, the, ideal, of, sageliness, within, and, kingliness, without, ren, translated, as, humaneness, or, the, essence, proper, of, a, human, being, is, the, character, of, compassionate, mind, it, is, the, virtue, endowed, by, heaven, and, at, the, same, time, the, means, by, which, man, may, achieve, oneness, with, heaven, comprehending, his, own, origin, in, heaven, and, therefore, divine, essence, in, the, datong, shu, it, is, defined, as, to, form, one, body, with, all, things, and, when, the, self, and, others, are, not, separated, compassion, is, aroused, lord, heaven, and, jade, emperor, were, terms, for, a, confucianist, supreme, deity, who, was, an, anthropromorphized, tian, and, some, conceptions, of, it, thought, of, the, two, names, as, synonymous, tian, a, key, concept, in, chinese, thought, refers, to, the, god, of, heaven, the, northern, culmen, of, the, skies, and, its, spinning, stars, earthly, nature, and, its, laws, which, come, from, heaven, to, heaven, and, earth, that, is, all, things, and, to, the, awe, inspiring, forces, beyond, human, control, there, are, so, many, uses, in, chinese, thought, that, it, is, impossible, to, give, a, single, english, translation, confucius, used, the, term, in, a, mystical, way, he, wrote, in, the, analects, 7, 23, that, tian, gave, him, life, and, that, tian, watched, and, judged, 6, 28, 9, 12, in, 9, 5, confucius, says, that, a, person, may, know, the, movements, of, tian, and, this, provides, with, the, sense, of, having, a, special, place, in, the, universe, in, 17, 19, confucius, says, that, tian, spoke, to, him, though, not, in, words, the, scholar, ronnie, littlejohn, warns, that, tian, was, not, to, be, interpreted, as, a, personal, god, comparable, to, that, of, the, abrahamic, faiths, in, the, sense, of, an, otherworldly, or, transcendent, creator, rather, it, is, similar, to, what, taoists, meant, by, dao, the, way, things, are, or, the, regularities, of, the, world, which, stephan, feuchtwang, equates, with, the, ancient, greek, concept, of, physis, nature, as, the, generation, and, regenerations, of, things, and, of, the, moral, order, tian, may, also, be, compared, to, the, brahman, of, hindu, and, vedic, traditions, the, scholar, promise, hsu, in, the, wake, of, robert, b, louden, explained, 17, 19, what, does, tian, ever, say, yet, there, are, four, seasons, going, round, and, there, are, the, hundred, things, coming, into, being, what, does, tian, say, as, implying, that, even, though, tian, is, not, a, speaking, person, it, constantly, does, through, the, rhythms, of, nature, and, communicates, how, human, beings, ought, to, live, and, act, at, least, to, those, who, have, learnt, to, carefully, listen, to, it, duanmu, ci, a, disciple, of, confucius, said, that, tian, had, set, the, master, on, the, path, to, become, a, wise, man, 9, 6, in, 7, 23, confucius, says, that, he, has, no, doubt, left, that, tian, gave, him, life, and, from, it, he, had, developed, right, virtue, de, in, 8, 19, he, says, that, the, lives, of, the, sages, are, interwoven, with, tian, regarding, personal, gods, shen, energies, who, emanate, from, and, reproduce, tian, enliving, nature, in, the, analects, confucius, says, that, it, is, appropriate, yi, for, people, to, worship, j, ng, them, although, only, through, proper, rites, li, implying, respect, of, positions, and, discretion, confucius, himself, was, a, ritual, and, sacrificial, master, answering, to, a, disciple, who, asked, whether, it, is, better, to, sacrifice, to, the, god, of, the, stove, or, to, the, god, of, the, family, a, popular, saying, in, 3, 13, confucius, says, that, in, order, to, appropriately, pray, to, gods, one, should, first, know, and, respect, heaven, in, 3, 12, he, explains, that, religious, rituals, produce, meaningful, experiences, and, one, has, to, offer, sacrifices, in, person, acting, in, presence, otherwise, it, is, the, same, as, not, having, sacrificed, at, all, rites, and, sacrifices, to, the, gods, have, an, ethical, importance, they, generate, good, life, because, taking, part, in, them, leads, to, the, overcoming, of, the, self, analects, 10, 11, tells, that, confucius, always, took, a, small, part, of, his, food, and, placed, it, on, the, sacrificial, bowls, as, an, offering, to, his, ancestors, some, confucian, movements, worship, confucius, although, not, as, a, supreme, being, or, anything, else, approaching, the, power, of, tian, or, the, tao, and, or, gods, from, chinese, folk, religion, these, movements, are, not, a, part, of, mainstream, confucianism, although, the, boundary, between, chinese, folk, religion, and, confucianism, can, be, blurred, other, movements, such, as, mohism, which, was, later, absorbed, by, taoism, developed, a, more, theistic, idea, of, heaven, feuchtwang, explains, that, the, difference, between, confucianism, and, taoism, primarily, lies, in, the, fact, that, the, former, focuses, on, the, realisation, of, the, starry, order, of, heaven, in, human, society, while, the, latter, on, the, contemplation, of, the, dao, which, spontaneously, arises, in, nature, however, confucianism, does, venerate, many, aspects, of, nature, and, also, respects, various, tao, as, well, as, what, confucius, saw, as, the, main, tao, the, of, heaven, the, way, of, heaven, involves, lifelong, and, sincere, devotion, to, traditional, cultural, forms, and, wu, wei, a, state, of, spontaneous, harmony, between, individual, inclinations, and, the, sacred, way, kelly, james, clark, argued, that, confucius, himself, saw, tian, as, an, anthropomorphic, god, that, clark, hypothetically, refers, to, as, heavenly, supreme, emperor, although, most, other, scholars, on, confucianism, disagree, with, this, view, as, explained, by, stephan, feuchtwang, the, order, coming, from, heaven, preserves, the, world, and, has, to, be, followed, by, humanity, finding, a, middle, way, between, yin, and, yang, forces, in, each, new, configuration, of, reality, social, harmony, or, morality, is, identified, as, patriarchy, which, is, expressed, in, the, worship, of, ancestors, and, deified, progenitors, in, the, male, line, at, ancestral, shrines, confucian, ethical, codes, are, described, as, humanistic, they, may, be, practiced, by, all, the, members, of, a, society, confucian, ethics, is, characterised, by, the, promotion, of, virtues, encompassed, by, the, five, constants, elaborated, by, confucian, scholars, out, of, the, inherited, tradition, during, the, han, dynasty, the, five, constants, are, these, are, accompanied, by, the, classical, four, virtues, s, z, one, of, which, yi, is, also, included, among, the, five, constants, there, are, many, other, traditionally, confucian, values, such, as, honesty, ch, ng, bravery, y, ng, incorruptibility, li, n, kindness, forgiveness, sh, a, sense, of, right, and, wrong, ch, gentleness, w, n, kindheartenedness, li, ng, respect, g, ng, frugality, ji, n, and, r, ng, modesty, ren, is, the, confucian, virtue, denoting, the, good, feeling, a, virtuous, human, experiences, when, being, altruistic, internally, ren, can, mean, to, look, up, meaning, to, aspire, to, higher, heavenly, principles, or, ideals, it, is, exemplified, by, a, normal, adult, s, protective, feelings, for, children, it, is, considered, the, essence, of, the, human, being, endowed, by, heaven, and, at, the, same, time, the, means, by, which, someone, may, act, according, to, the, principle, of, heaven, and, become, one, with, it, yan, hui, confucius, s, most, outstanding, student, once, asked, his, master, to, describe, the, rules, of, ren, and, confucius, replied, one, should, see, nothing, improper, hear, nothing, improper, say, nothing, improper, do, nothing, improper, confucius, also, defined, ren, in, the, following, way, wishing, to, be, established, himself, seeks, also, to, establish, others, wishing, to, be, enlarged, himself, he, seeks, also, to, enlarge, others, another, meaning, of, ren, is, not, to, do, to, others, as, you, would, not, wish, done, to, yourself, confucius, also, said, ren, is, not, far, off, he, who, seeks, it, has, already, found, it, ren, is, close, to, man, and, never, leaves, him, li, is, a, word, which, finds, its, most, extensive, use, in, confucian, and, post, confucian, chinese, philosophy, li, is, variously, translated, as, rite, or, reason, ratio, in, the, pure, sense, of, vedic, ta, right, order, when, referring, to, the, cosmic, law, but, when, referring, to, its, realisation, in, the, context, of, human, social, behaviour, it, has, also, been, translated, as, customs, measures, and, rules, among, other, terms, li, also, means, religious, rites, which, establish, relations, between, humanity, and, the, gods, according, to, stephan, feuchtwang, rites, are, conceived, as, what, makes, the, invisible, visible, making, possible, for, humans, to, cultivate, the, underlying, order, of, nature, correctly, performed, rituals, move, society, in, alignment, with, earthly, and, heavenly, astral, forces, establishing, the, harmony, of, the, three, realms, heaven, earth, and, humanity, this, practice, is, defined, as, centering, y, ng, or, zh, ng, among, all, things, of, creation, humans, themselves, are, central, because, they, have, the, ability, to, cultivate, and, centre, natural, forces, li, embodies, the, entire, web, of, interaction, between, humanity, human, objects, and, nature, confucius, includes, in, his, discussions, of, li, such, diverse, topics, as, learning, tea, drinking, titles, mourning, and, governance, xunzi, cites, songs, and, laughter, weeping, and, lamentation, rice, and, millet, fish, and, meat, the, wearing, of, ceremonial, caps, embroidered, robes, and, patterned, silks, or, of, fasting, clothes, and, mourning, clothes, spacious, rooms, and, secluded, halls, soft, mats, couches, and, benches, as, vital, parts, of, the, fabric, of, li, confucius, envisioned, proper, government, being, guided, by, the, principles, of, li, some, confucians, proposed, that, all, human, beings, may, pursue, perfection, by, learning, and, practising, li, overall, confucians, believe, that, governments, should, place, more, emphasis, on, li, and, rely, much, less, on, penal, punishment, when, they, govern, loyalty, zh, ng, is, particularly, relevant, for, the, social, class, to, which, most, of, confucius, s, students, belonged, because, the, most, important, way, for, an, ambitious, young, scholar, to, become, a, prominent, official, was, to, enter, a, ruler, s, civil, service, confucius, himself, did, not, propose, that, might, makes, right, but, rather, that, a, superior, should, be, obeyed, because, of, his, moral, rectitude, in, addition, loyalty, does, not, mean, subservience, to, authority, this, is, because, reciprocity, is, demanded, from, the, superior, as, well, as, confucius, stated, a, prince, should, employ, his, minister, according, to, the, rules, of, propriety, ministers, should, serve, their, prince, with, faithfulness, loyalty, similarly, mencius, also, said, that, when, the, prince, regards, his, ministers, as, his, hands, and, feet, his, ministers, regard, their, prince, as, their, belly, and, heart, when, he, regards, them, as, his, dogs, and, horses, they, regard, him, as, another, man, when, he, regards, them, as, the, ground, or, as, grass, they, regard, him, as, a, robber, and, an, enemy, moreover, mencius, indicated, that, if, the, ruler, is, incompetent, he, should, be, replaced, if, the, ruler, is, evil, then, the, people, have, the, right, to, overthrow, him, a, good, confucian, is, also, expected, to, remonstrate, with, his, superiors, when, necessary, at, the, same, time, a, proper, confucian, ruler, should, also, accept, his, ministers, advice, as, this, will, help, him, govern, the, realm, better, in, later, ages, however, emphasis, was, often, placed, more, on, the, obligations, of, the, ruled, to, the, ruler, and, less, on, the, ruler, s, obligations, to, the, ruled, like, filial, piety, loyalty, was, often, subverted, by, the, autocratic, regimes, in, china, nonetheless, throughout, the, ages, many, confucians, continued, to, fight, against, unrighteous, superiors, and, rulers, many, of, these, confucians, suffered, and, sometimes, died, because, of, their, conviction, and, action, during, the, ming, qing, era, prominent, confucians, such, as, wang, yangming, promoted, individuality, and, independent, thinking, as, a, counterweight, to, subservience, to, authority, the, famous, thinker, huang, zongxi, also, strongly, criticised, the, autocratic, nature, of, the, imperial, system, and, wanted, to, keep, imperial, power, in, check, many, confucians, also, realised, that, loyalty, and, filial, piety, have, the, potential, of, coming, into, conflict, with, one, another, this, may, be, true, especially, in, times, of, social, chaos, such, as, during, the, period, of, the, ming, qing, transition, in, confucian, philosophy, filial, piety, xi, o, is, a, virtue, of, respect, for, one, s, parents, and, ancestors, and, of, the, hierarchies, within, society, father, son, elder, junior, and, male, female, the, confucian, classic, xiaojing, book, of, piety, thought, to, be, written, during, the, qin, or, han, dynasties, has, historically, been, the, authoritative, source, on, the, confucian, tenet, of, xiao, the, book, a, conversation, between, confucius, and, his, disciple, zeng, shen, is, about, how, to, set, up, a, good, society, using, the, principle, of, xiao, in, more, general, terms, filial, piety, means, to, be, good, to, one, s, parents, to, take, care, of, one, s, parents, to, engage, in, good, conduct, not, just, towards, parents, but, also, outside, the, home, so, as, to, bring, a, good, name, to, one, s, parents, and, ancestors, to, perform, the, duties, of, one, s, job, well, so, as, to, obtain, the, material, means, to, support, parents, as, well, as, carry, out, sacrifices, to, the, ancestors, not, be, rebellious, show, love, respect, and, support, the, wife, in, filial, piety, must, obey, her, husband, absolutely, and, take, care, of, the, whole, family, wholeheartedly, display, courtesy, ensure, male, heirs, uphold, fraternity, among, brothers, wisely, advise, one, s, parents, including, dissuading, them, from, moral, unrighteousness, for,

considered, a, key, virtue, in, chinese, culture, and, it, is, the, main, concern, of, a, large, number, of, stories, one, of, the, most, famous, collections, of, such, stories, is, the, twenty, four, filial, exemplars, these, stories, depict, how, children, exercised, their, filial, piety, in, the, past, while, china, has, always, had, a, diversity, of, religious, beliefs, filial, piety, has, been, common, to, almost, all, of, them, historian, hugh, d, r, baker, calls, respect, for, the, family, the, only, element, common, to, almost, all, chinese, believers, social, harmony, results, in,

and, involves, the, entire, network, of, social, relations, even, the, respect, for, rulers, this, is, shown, in, the, story, where, duke, jing, of, qi, asks, confucius, about, government, by, which, he, meant, proper, administration, so, as, to, bring, social, harmony, the, duke, jing, of, qi, asked, confucius, about, government, confucius, replied, there, is, government, when, the, prince, is,

younger, siblings, students, and, others, while, juniors, are, considered, in, confucianism, to, owe, their, seniors, reverence, seniors, also, have, duties, of, benevolence, and, concern, toward, juniors, the, same, is, true, with, the, husband, and, wife, relationship, where, the, husband, needs, to, show, benevolence, towards, his, wife, and, the, wife, needs, to, respect, the, husband, in,

philosophical, term, often, translated, as, gentleman, or, superior, person, and, employed, by, confucius, in, the, analects, to, describe, the, ideal, man, in, confucianism, the, sage, or, wise, is, the, ideal, personality, however, it, is, very, hard, to, become, one, of, them, confucius, created, the, model, of, junzi, gentleman, which, may, be, achieved, by, any, individual, later, zhu, xi, defined, junzi, as, second, only, to, the, sage, there, are, many, characteristics, of, the, junzi, he, may, live, in, poverty, he, does, more, and, speaks, less, he, is, loyal, obedient, and, knowledgeable, the, junzi, disciplines, himself, ren, is, fundamental, to, become, a, junzi, as, the, potential, leader, of, a, nation, a, son, of, the, ruler, is, raised, to, have, a, superior, ethical, and, moral, position, while, gaining, inner, peace, through, his, virtue, to, confucius, the, junzi, sustained, the, functions, of, government, and, social, stratification, through, his,

person, does, not, grasp, the, value, of, virtues, and, seeks, only, immediate, gains, the, petty, person, is, egotistic, and, does, not, consider, the, consequences, of, his, action, in, the, overall, scheme, of, things, should, the, ruler, be, surrounded, by, xiaoren, as, opposed, to, junzi, his, governance, and, his, people, will, suffer, due, to, their, small, mindness, examples, of, such, xiaoren, individuals, may, range, from, those, who, continually, indulge, in, sensual, and, emotional, pleasures, all, day, to, the, politician, who, is, interested, merely, in, power, and,

virtue, would, lead, others, to, follow, his, example, the, ultimate, goal, is, that, the, government, behaves, much, like, a, family, the, junzi, being, a, beacon, of, filial, piety, confucius, believed, that, social, disorder, often, stemmed, from, failure, to, perceive, understand, and, deal, with, reality, fundamentally, then, social, disorder, may, stem, from, the, failure, to, call, things, by, their, proper, names, and, his, solution, to, this, was, the, rectification, of, names, zh, ngm, ng, he, gave, an, explanation, of, this, concept, to, one, of, his, disciples, zi, lu,

resulting, in, a, period, of, perceived, moral, decline, confucius, saw, an, opportunity, to, reinforce, values, of, compassion, and, tradition, into, society, with, the, intended, goal, of, reconstructing, what, he, believed, to, be, a, lost, perfect, moral, order, of, high, antiquity, disillusioned, with, the, culture, opposing, scholars, and, religious, authorities, of, the, time, he,

humaneness, and, rightness, decency, and, altruism, confucius, conceived, these, qualities, as, the, foundation, needed, to, restore, socio, political, harmony, like, many, contemporaries, confucius, saw, ritual, practices, as, efficacious, ways, to, access, tian, but, he, thought, that, the, crucial, knot, was, the, reverent, inner, state, that, participants, enter, prior, to, engaging, in, the, ritual, acts, confucius, is, said, to, have, amended, and, recodified, the, classical, books, inherited, from, the, xia, shang, zhou, dynasties, and, to, have, composed, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, philosophers, in, the, warring, states, period, both, focused, on, state, endorsed, ritual, and, non, aligned, to, state, ritual, built, upon, confucius, s, legacy, compiled, in, the,

the, one, y, which, in, each, individual, is, the, heaven, bestowed, divine, power, to, rule, one, s, own, life, and, the, world, they, also, extended, the, theory, proposing, the, oneness, of, production, and, reabsorption, into, the, cosmic, source, and, the, possibility, to, understand, and, therefore, reattain, it, through, correct, state, of, mind, this, line, of, thought, would, have, influenced, all, chinese, individual, and, collective, political, mystical, theories, and, practices, thereafter, in, the, han, dynasty, confucians, beginning, with, dong, zhongshu, synthesised, warring, states, confucianism, with, ideas, of, yin, and, yang, and, wuxing, as, well, as, folk, superstition, and, the, prior, schools, that, led, up, to, the, school, of, naturalists, in, the, 460s, confucianism, competed, with, chinese, buddhism, and, traditional, confucianism, was, a, broad, cosmology, that, was, as, much, about, personal, ethics, as, about, spiritual, beliefs, and, had, roots, that, went, back, to, confucianist, philosophers, from, over, a, thousand, years, before, since, the, 2000s, there, has, been, a, growing, identification, of, the, chinese, intellectual, class, with, confucianism, in, 2003, the, confucian, intellectual, kang, xiaoguang, published, a, manifesto, in, which, he, made, four, suggestions, confucian, education, should, enter, official, education, at, any, level, from, elementary, to, high, school, the, state, should, establish, confucianism, as, the, state, religion, by, law, confucian, religion, should, enter, the, daily, life, of, ordinary, people, through, standardisation, and, development, of, doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches, and, activity, sites, the, confucian, religion, should, be, spread, through, non, governmental, organisations, another, modern, proponent, of, the, institutionalisation, of, confucianism, in, a, state, church, is, jiang, qing, in, 2005, the, center, for, the, study, of, confucian, religion, was, established, and, guoxue, started, to, be, implemented, in, public, schools, on, all, levels, being, well, received, by, the, population, even, confucian, preachers, have, appeared, on, television, since, 2006, the, most, enthusiastic, new, confucians, proclaim, the, uniqueness, and, superiority, of, confucian, chinese, culture, and, have, generated, some, popular, sentiment, against, western, cultural, influences, in, china, the, idea, of, a, confucian, church, as, the, state, religion, of, china, has, roots, in, the, thought, of, kang, youwei, an, exponent, of, the, early, new, confucian, search, for, a, regeneration, of, the, social, relevance, of, confucianism, at, a, time, when, it, was, de, institutionalised, with, the, collapse, of, the, qing, dynasty, and, the, chinese, empire, kang, modeled, his, ideal, confucian, church, after, european, national, christian, churches, as, a, hierarchic, and, centralised, institution, closely, bound, to, the, state, with, local, church, branches, devoted, to, the, worship, and, the, spread, of, the, teachings, of, confucius, in, contemporary, china, the, confucian, revival, has, developed, into, various, interwoven, directions, the, proliferation, of, confucian, schools, or, academies, the, resurgence, of, confucian, rites, and, the, birth, of, new, forms, of, confucian, activity, on, the, popular, level, such, as, the, confucian, communities, sh, q, r, xu, some, scholars, also, consider, the, reconstruction, of, lineage, churches, and, their, ancestral, temples, as, well, as, cults, and, temples, of, natural, and, national, gods, within, broader, chinese, traditional, religion, as, part, of, the, renewal, of, confucianism, other, forms, of, revival, are, salvationist, folk, religious, movements, groups, with, a, specifically, confucian, focus, or, confucian, churches, for, example, the, y, d, n, xu, t, ng, of, beijing, the, m, ngm, t, ng, of, shanghai, confucian, shenism, also, known, as, the, phoenix, churches, the, confucian, fellowship, r, ji, o, d, ot, n, in, northern, fujian, which, has, spread, rapidly, over, the, years, after, its, foundation, and, ancestral, temples, of, the, kong, kin, the, lineage, of, the, descendants, of, confucius, himself, operating, as, confucian, teaching, churches, also, the, hong, kong, confucian, academy, one, of, the, direct, heirs, of, kang, youwei, s, confucian, church, has, expanded, its, activities, to, the, mainland, with, the, construction, of, statues, of, confucius, confucian, hospitals, restoration, of, temples, and, other, activities, in, 2009, zhou, beichen, founded, another, institution, which, inherits, the, idea, of, kang, youwei, s, confucian, church, the, holy, hall, of, confucius, k, ngsh, ngt, ng, in, shenzhen, affiliated, with, the, federation, of, confucian, culture, of, qufu, city, it, was, the, first, of, a, nationwide, movement, of, congregations, and, civil, organisations, that, was, unified, in, 2015, in, the,

recently, rediscovered, concept, defining, people, of, the, economic, entrepreneurial, elite, who, recognise, their, social, responsibility, and, therefore, apply, confucian, culture, to, their, business, confucianists, historically, tried, to, proselytize, to, others, although, this, is, rarely, done, in, modern, times, given, confucianism, s, place, of, importance, in, historical, chinese, governments, the, argument, has, been, made, that, imperial, china, s, wars, were, confucianism, s, wars, but, the, connection, between, confucianism, and, war, is, not, so, direct, or, simple, modern, confucianism, is, the, descendant, of, movements, that, greatly, changed, how, they, practiced, the, teachings, of, confucius, and, his, disciples, from, previous, orthodox, teachings, the, master, said, he, who, exercises, government, by, means, of, his, virtue, may, be, compared, to, the, north, polar, star, which, keeps, its, place, and, all, the, stars, turn, towards, it, a, key, confucian, concept, is, that, in, order, to, govern, others, one, must, first, govern, oneself, according, to, the, universal, order, when, actual, the, king, s, personal, virtue, de, spreads, beneficent, influence, throughout, the, kingdom, this, idea, is, developed, further, in, the, great, learning, and, is, tightly, linked, with, the, taoist, concept, of, wu, wei, the, less, the, king, does, the, more, gets, done, by, being, the, calm, center, around, which, the, kingdom, turns, the, king, allows, everything, to, function, smoothly, and, avoids, having, to, tamper, with, the, individual, parts, of, the, whole, this, idea, may, be, traced, back, to, the, ancient, shamanic, beliefs, of, the, king, being, the, axle, between, the, sky, human, beings, and, the, earth, the, emperors, of, china, were, considered, agents, of, heaven, endowed, with, the, mandate, of, heaven, one, of, the, most, vital, concepts, in, imperial, era, political, theory, some, confucianists, believed, they, held, the, power, to, define, the, hierarchy, of, divinities, by, bestowing, titles, upon, mountains, rivers, and, dead, people, acknowledging, them, as, powerful, and, therefore, establishing, their, cults, confucianism, despite, supporting, the, importance, of, obeying, national, authority, places, this, obedience, under, absolute, moral, principles, that, curbed, the, willful, exercise, of, power, rather, than, being, unconditional, submission, to, authority, was, only, taken, within, the, context, of, the, moral, obligations, that, rulers, had, toward, their, subjects, in, particular, ren, confucians, including, the, most, pro, authoritarian, scholars, such, as, xunzi, have, always, recognised, the, right, of, revolution, against, tyranny, the, master, said, in, teaching, there, should, be, no, distinction, of, classes, although, confucius, claimed, that, he, never, invented, anything, but, was, only, transmitting, ancient, knowledge, analects, 7, 1, he, did, produce, a, number, of, new, ideas, many, european, and, american, admirers, such, as, voltaire, and, herrlee, g, creel, point, to, the, revolutionary, idea, of, replacing, nobility, of, blood, with, nobility, of, virtue, junzi, lord, s, son, which, originally, signified, the, younger, non, inheriting, offspring, of, a, noble, became, in, confucius, s, work, an, epithet, having, much, the, same, meaning, and, evolution, as, the, english, gentleman, a, virtuous, commoner, who, cultivates, his, qualities, may, be, a, gentleman, while, a, shameless, son, of, the, king, is, only, a, petty, person, that, confucius, admitted, students, of, different, classes, as, disciples, is, a, clear, demonstration, that, he, fought, against, the, feudal, structures, that, defined, pre, imperial, chinese, society, another, new, idea, that, of, meritocracy, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, imperial, examination, system, in, china, this, system, allowed, anyone, who, passed, an, examination, to, become, a, government, officer, a, position, which, would, bring, wealth, and, honour, to, the, whole, family, the, chinese, imperial, examination, system, started, in, the, sui, dynasty, over, the, following, centuries, the, system, grew, until, finally, almost, anyone, who, wished, to, become, an, official, had, to, prove, his, worth, by, passing, a, set, of, written, government, examinations, confucian, political, meritocracy, is, not, merely, a, historical, phenomenon, the, practice, of, meritocracy, still, exists, across, china, and, east, asia, today, and, a, wide, range, of, contemporary, intellectuals, from, daniel, bell, to, tongdong, bai, joseph, chan, and, jiang, qing, defend, political, meritocracy, as, a, viable, alternative, to, liberal, democracy, in, just, hierarchy, daniel, bell, and, wang, pei, argue, that, hierarchies, are, inevitable, faced, with, ever, increasing, complexity, at, scale, modern, societies, must, build, hierarchies, to, coordinate, collective, action, and, tackle, long, term, problems, such, as, climate, change, in, this, context, people, need, not, and, should, not, want, to, flatten, hierarchies, as, much, as, possible, they, ought, to, ask, what, makes, political, hierarchies, just, and, use, these, criteria, to, decide, the, institutions, that, deserve, preservation, those, that, require, reform, and, those, that, need, radical, transformation, they, call, this, approach, progressive, conservatism, a, term, that, reflects, the, ambiguous, place, of, the, confucian, tradition, within, the, left, right, dichotomy, 8, 21, bell, and, wang, propose, two, justifications, for, political, hierarchies, that, do, not, depend, on, a, one, person, one, vote, system, first, is, raw, efficiency, which, may, require, centralized, rule, in, the, hands, of, the, competent, few, second, and, most, important, is, serving, the, interests, of, the, people, and, the, common, good, more, broadly, 66, 93, in, against, political, equality, tongdong, bai, complements, this, account, by, using, a, proto, rawlsian, political, difference, principle, just, as, rawls, claims, that, economic, inequality, is, justified, so, long, as, it, benefits, those, at, the, bottom, of, the, socioeconomic, ladder, so, bai, argues, that, political, inequality, is, justified, so, long, as, it, benefits, those, materially, worse, off, 102, 106, bell, wang, and, bai, all, criticize, liberal, democracy, to, argue, that, government, by, the, people, may, not, be, government, for, the, people, in, any, meaningful, sense, of, the, term, they, argue, that, voters, tend, to, act, in, irrational, tribal, short, termist, ways, they, are, vulnerable, to, populism, and, struggle, to, account, for, the, interests, of, future, generations, in, other, words, at, a, minimum, democracy, needs, confucian, meritocratic, checks, 32, 47, in, the, china, model, bell, argues, that, confucian, political, meritocracy, provides, and, has, provided, a, blueprint, for, china, s, development, for, bell, the, ideal, according, to, which, china, should, reform, itself, and, has, reformed, itself, follows, a, simple, structure, aspiring, rulers, first, pass, hyper, selective, examinations, then, have, to, rule, well, at, the, local, level, to, be, promoted, to, positions, as, the, provincial, level, then, have, to, excel, at, the, provincial, level, to, access, positions, at, the, national, level, and, so, on, 151, 179, this, system, aligns, with, what, harvard, historian, james, hankins, calls, virtue, politics, or, the, idea, that, institutions, should, be, built, to, select, the, most, competent, and, virtuous, rulers, as, opposed, to, institutions, concerned, first, and, foremost, with, limiting, the, power, of, rulers, while, contemporary, defenders, of, confucian, political, meritocracy, all, accept, this, broad, frame, they, disagree, with, each, other, on, three, main, questions, institutional, design, the, means, by, which, meritocrats, are, promoted, and, the, compatibility, of, confucian, political, meritocracy, with, liberalism, bell, and, wang, favour, a, system, in, which, officials, at, the, local, level, are, democratically, elected, and, higher, level, officials, are, promoted, by, peers, 66, 93, as, bell, puts, it, he, defends, democracy, at, the, bottom, experimentation, in, the, middle, and, meritocracy, at, the, top, 151, 179, bell, and, wang, argue, that, this, combination, conserves, the, main, advantages, of, democracy, involving, the, people, in, public, affairs, at, the, local, level, strengthening, the, legitimacy, of, the, system, forcing, some, degree, of, direct, accountability, etc, while, preserving, the, broader, meritocratic, character, of, the, regime, jiang, qing, by, contrast, imagines, a, tricameral, government, with, one, chamber, selected, by, the, people, the, house, of, the, commoners, one, chamber, composed, of, confucian, meritocrats, selected, via, examination, and, gradual, promotion, the, house, of, confucian, tradition, and, one, body, made, up, of, descendants, of, confucius, himself, the, house, of, national, essence, jiang, s, aim, is, to, construct, a, legitimacy, that, will, go, beyond, what, he, sees, as, the, atomistic, individualist, and, utilitarian, ethos, of, modern, democracies, and, ground, authority, in, something, sacred, and, traditional, while, jiang, s, model, is, closer, to, an, ideal, theory, than, bell, s, proposals, it, represents, a, more, traditionalist, alternative, tongdong, bai, presents, an, in, between, solution, by, proposing, a, two, tiered, bicameral, system, 52, 110, at, the, local, level, as, with, bell, bai, advocates, deweyan, participatory, democracy, at, the, national, level, bai, proposes, two, chambers, one, of, meritocrats, selected, by, examination, by, examination, and, promotion, from, leaders, in, certain, professional, fields, etc, and, one, of, representatives, elected, by, the, people, while, the, lower, house, does, not, have, any, legislative, power, per, se, it, acts, as, a, popular, accountability, mechanism, by, championing, the, people, and, putting, pressure, on, the, upper, house, more, generally, bai, argues, that, his, model, marries, the, best, of, meritocracy, and, democracy, following, dewey, s, account, of, democracy, as, a, way, of, life, he, points, to, the, participatory, features, of, his, local, model, citizens, still, get, to, have, a, democratic, lifestyle, participate, in, political, affairs, and, be, educated, as, democratic, men, similarly, the, lower, house, allows, citizens, to, be, represented, have, a, voice, in, public, affairs, albeit, a, weak, one, and, ensure, accountability, meanwhile, the, meritocratic, house, preserves, competence, statesmanship, and, confucian, virtues, defenders, of, confucian, political, meritocracy, generally, champion, a, system, in, which, rulers, are, selected, on, the, basis, of, intellect, social, skills, and, virtue, bell, proposes, a, model, wherein, aspiring, meritocrats, take, hyper, selective, exams, and, prove, themselves, at, the, local, levels, of, government, before, reaching, the, higher, levels, of, government, where, they, hold, more, centralized, power, 151, 179, in, his, account, the, exams, select, for, intellect, and, other, virtues, for, instance, the, ability, to, argue, three, different, viewpoints, on, a, contentious, issue, may, indicate, a, certain, degree, of, openness, 63, 110, tongdong, bai, s, approach, incorporates, different, ways, to, select, members, of, the, meritocratic, house, from, exams, to, performance, in, various, fields, business, science, administration, and, so, on, in, every, case, confucian, meritocrats, draw, on, china, s, extensive, history, of, meritocratic, administration, to, outline, the, pros, and, cons, of, competing, methods, of, selection, 67, 97, for, those, who, like, bell, defend, a, model, in, which, performance, at, the, local, levels, of, government, determines, future, promotion, an, important, question, is, how, the, system, judges, who, performs, best, in, other, words, while, examinations, may, ensure, that, early, career, officials, are, competent, and, educated, how, is, it, thereafter, ensured, that, only, those, who, rule, well, get, promoted, the, literature, opposes, those, who, prefer, evaluation, by, peers, to, evaluation, by, superiors, with, some, thinkers, including, quasi, democratic, selection, mechanisms, along, the, way, bell, and, wang, favour, a, system, in, which, officials, at, the, local, level, are, democratically, elected, and, higher, level, officials, are, promoted, by, peers, 84, 106, because, they, believe, that, promotion, should, depend, upon, peer, evaluations, only, bell, and, wang, argue, against, transparency, i, e, the, public, should, not, know, how, officials, are, selected, since, ordinary, people, are, in, no, position, to, judge, officials, beyond, the, local, level, 76, 78, others, like, jiang, qing, defend, a, model, in, which, superiors, decide, who, gets, promoted, this, method, is, in, line, with, more, traditionalist, strands, of, confucian, political, thought, which, place, a, greater, emphasis, on, strict, hierarchies, and, epistemic, paternalism, that, is, the, idea, that, older, and, more, experienced, people, know, more, 27, 44, another, key, question, is, whether, confucian, political, thought, is, compatible, with, liberalism, tongdong, bai, for, instance, argues, that, while, confucian, political, thought, departs, from, the, one, person, one, vote, model, it, can, conserve, many, of, the, essential, characteristics, of, liberalism, such, as, freedom, of, speech, and, individual, rights, 97, 110, in, fact, both, daniel, bell, and, tongdong, bai, hold, that, confucian, political, meritocracy, can, tackle, challenges, that, liberalism, wants, to, tackle, but, cannot, by, itself, at, the, cultural, level, for, instance, confucianism, its, institutions, and, its, rituals, offer, bulwarks, against, atomization, and, individualism, at, the, political, level, the, non, democratic, side, of, political, meritocracy, is, for, bell, and, bai, more, efficient, at, addressing, long, term, questions, such, as, climate, change, in, part, because, the, meritocrats, do, not, have, to, worry, about, the, whims, of, public, opinion, 14, 63, joseph, chan, defends, the, compatibility, of, confucianism, with, both, liberalism, and, democracy, in, his, book, confucian, perfectionism, he, argues, that, confucians, can, embrace, both, democracy, and, liberalism, on, instrumental, grounds, that, is, while, liberal, democracy, may, not, be, valuable, for, its, own, sake, its, institutions, remain, valuable, particularly, when, combined, with, a, broadly, confucian, culture, to, serve, confucian, ends, and, inculcate, confucian, virtues, other, confucians, have, criticized, confucian, meritocrats, like, bell, for, their, rejection, of, democracy, for, them, confucianism, does, not, have, to, be, premised, on, the, assumption, that, meritorious, virtuous, political, leadership, is, inherently, incompatible, with, popular, sovereignty, political, equality, and, the, right, to, political, participation, these, thinkers, accuse, the, meritocrats, of, overestimating, the, flaws, of, democracy, mistaking, temporary, flaws, for, permanent, and, inherent, features, and, underestimating, the, challenges, that, the, construction, of, a, true, political, meritocracy, poses, in, practice, including, those, faced, by, contemporary, china, and, singapore, franz, mang, claims, that, when, decoupled, from, democracy, meritocracy, tends, to, deteriorate, into, an, oppressive, regime, under, putatively, meritorious, but, actually, authoritarian, rulers, mang, accuses, bell, s, china, model, of, being, self, defeating, as, mang, claims, the, ccp, s, authoritarian, modes, of, engagement, with, the, dissenting, voices, illustrate, he, baogang, and, mark, warren, add, that, meritocracy, should, be, understood, as, a, concept, describing, a, regime, s, character, rather, than, its, type, which, is, determined, by, distribution, of, political, power, on, their, view, democratic, institutions, can, be, built, which, are, meritocratic, insofar, as, they, favour, competence, roy, tseng, drawing, on, the, new, confucians, of, the, twentieth, century, argues, that, confucianism, and, liberal, democracy, can, enter, into, a, dialectical, process, in, which, liberal, rights, and, voting, rights, are, rethought, into, resolutely, modern, but, nonetheless, confucian, ways, of, life, this, synthesis, blending, confucians, rituals, and, institutions, with, a, broader, liberal, democratic, frame, is, distinct, from, both, western, style, liberalism, which, for, tseng, suffers, from, excessive, individualism, and, a, lack, of, moral, vision, and, from, traditional, confucianism, which, for, tseng, has, historically, suffered, from, rigid, hierarchies, and, sclerotic, elites, against, defenders, of, political, meritocracy, tseng, claims, that, the, fusion, of, confucian, and, democratic, institutions, can, conserve, the, best, of, both, worlds, producing, a, more, communal, democracy, which, draws, on, a, rich, ethical, tradition, addresses, abuses, of, power, and, combines, popular, accountability, with, a, clear, attention, to, the, cultivation, of, virtue, in, elites, the, works, of, confucius, were, translated, into, european, languages, through, the, agency, of, jesuit, missionaries, stationed, in, china, matteo, ricci, was, among, the, very, earliest, to, report, on, the, thoughts, of, confucius, and, father, prospero, intorcetta, wrote, about, the, life, and, works, of, confucius, in, latin, in, 1687, translations, of, confucian, texts, influenced, european, thinkers, of, the, period, particularly, among, the, deists, and, other, philosophical, groups, of, the, enlightenment, who, were, interested, by, the, integration, of, the, system, of, morality, of, confucius, into, western, civilization, confucianism, influenced, the, german, philosopher, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, who, was, attracted, to, the, philosophy, because, of, its, perceived, similarity, to, his, own, it, is, postulated, that, certain, elements, of, leibniz, s, philosophy, such, as, simple, substance, and, pre, established, harmony, were, borrowed, from, his, interactions, with, confucianism, the, french, philosopher, voltaire, leibniz, s, intellectual, rival, was, also, influenced, by, confucius, seeing, the, concept, of, confucian, rationalism, as, an, alternative, to, christian, dogma, he, praised, confucian, ethics, and, politics, portraying, the, sociopolitical, hierarchy, of, china, as, a, model, for, europe, confucius, has, no, interest, in, falsehood, he, did, not, pretend, to, be, prophet, he, claimed, no, inspiration, he, taught, no, new, religion, he, used, no, delusions, flattered, not, the, emperor, under, whom, he, lived, from, the, late, 17th, century, onwards, a, whole, body, of, literature, known, as, the, han, kitab, developed, amongst, the, hui, muslims, of, china, who, infused, islamic, thought, with, confucianism, especially, the, works, of, liu, zhi, such, as, tianfang, dianli, ti, nf, ng, di, nl, sought, to, harmonise, islam, with, not, only, confucianism, but, also, with, taoism, and, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, crowning, achievements, of, the, chinese, islamic, culture, important, military, and, political, figures, in, modern, chinese, history, continued, to, be, influenced, by, confucianism, like, the, muslim, warlord, ma, fuxiang, the, new, life, movement, in, the, early, 20th, century, was, also, influenced, by, confucianism, referred, to, variously, as, the, confucian, hypothesis, and, as, a, debated, component, of, the, more, all, encompassing, asian, development, model, there, exists, among, political, scientists, and, economists, a, theory, that, confucianism, plays, a, large, latent, role, in, the, ostensibly, non, confucian, cultures, of, modern, day, east, asia, in, the, form, of, the, rigorous, work, ethic, it, endowed, those, cultures, with, these, scholars, have, held, that, if, not, for, confucianism, s, influence, on, these, cultures, many, of, the, people, of, the, east, asia, region, would, not, have, been, able, to, modernise, and, industrialise, as, quickly, as, singapore, malaysia, hong, kong, taiwan, japan, south, korea, and, even, china, have, done, for, example, the, impact, of, the, vietnam, war, on, vietnam, was, devastating, but, over, the, last, few, decades, vietnam, has, been, re, developing, in, a, very, fast, pace, most, scholars, attribute, the, origins, of, this, idea, to, futurologist, herman, kahn, s, world, economic, development, 1979, and, beyond, other, studies, for, example, cristobal, kay, s, why, east, asia, overtook, latin, america, agrarian, reform, industrialization, and, development, have, attributed, the, asian, growth, to, other, factors, for, example, the, character, of, agrarian, reforms, state, craft, state, capacity, and, interaction, between, agriculture, and, industry, historical, and, current, confucianists, were, and, are, often, environmentalists, out, of, their, respect, for, tian, and, the, other, aspects, of, nature, and, the, principle, that, comes, from, their, unity, and, more, generally, harmony, as, a, whole, which, is, the, basis, for, a, sincere, mind, after, confucianism, had, become, the, official, state, religion, in, china, its, influence, penetrated, all, walks, of, life, and, all, streams, of, thought, in, chinese, society, for, the, generations, to, come, this, did, not, exclude, martial, arts, culture, though, in, his, own, day, confucius, had, rejected, the, practice, of, martial, arts, with, the, exception, of, archery, he, did, serve, under, rulers, who, used, military, power, extensively, to, achieve, their, goals, in, later, centuries, confucianism, heavily, influenced, many, educated, martial, artists, of, great, influence, such, as, sun, lutang, especially, from, the, 19th, century, onwards, when, bare, handed, martial, arts, in, china, became, more, widespread, and, had, begun, to, more, readily, absorb, philosophical, influences, from, confucianism, buddhism, and, daoism, eastward, spread, of, western, learning, confucius, and, confucianism, were, opposed, or, criticised, from, the, start, including, laozi, s, philosophy, and, mozi, s, critique, and, legalists, such, as, han, fei, ridiculed, the, idea, that, virtue, would, lead, people, to, be, orderly, in, modern, times, waves, of, opposition, and, vilification, showed, that, confucianism, instead, of, taking, credit, for, the, glories, of, chinese, civilisation, now, had, to, take, blame, for, its, failures, the, taiping, rebellion, described, confucianism, sages, as, well, as, gods, in, taoism, and, buddhism, as, devils, in, the, new, culture, movement, lu, xun, criticised, confucianism, for, shaping, chinese, people, into, the, condition, they, had, reached, by, the, late, qing, dynasty, his, criticisms, are, expressed, metaphorically, in, the, work, diary, of, a, madman, in, which, traditional, chinese, confucian, society, is, portrayed, as, feudalistic, hypocritical, socially, cannibalistic, despotic, fostering, a, slave, mentality, favouring, despotism, lack, of, critical, thinking, and, blind, obedience, and, worship, of, authority, fuelling, a, form, of, confucian, authoritarianism, which, persists, into, the, present, day, leftists, during, the, cultural, revolution, described, confucius, as, the, representative, of, the, slave, owning, class, in, south, korea, there, has, long, been, criticism, some, south, koreans, believe, confucianism, has, not, contributed, to, the, modernisation, of, south, korea, for, example, south, korean, writer, kim, kyong, il, wrote, a, book, in, 1998, entitled, confucius, must, die, for, the, nation, to, live, gongjaga, jug, eoya, naraga, sanda, kim, said, that, filial, piety, is, one, sided, and, blind, and, if, it, continues, social, problems, will, continue, as, government, keeps, forcing, confucian, filial, obligations, onto, families, confucianism, largely, defined, the, mainstream, discourse, on, gender, in, china, from, the, han, dynasty, onward, the, gender, roles, prescribed, in, the, three, obediences, and, four, virtues, became, a, cornerstone, of, the, family, and, thus, societal, stability, the, three, obediences, and, four, virtues, is, one, of, the, moral, standards, for, feudal, etiquette, to, bind, women, starting, from, the, han, period, confucians, began, to, teach, that, a, virtuous, woman, was, supposed, to, follow, the, males, in, her, family, the, father, before, her, marriage, the, husband, after, she, marries, and, her, sons, in, widowhood, in, the, later, dynasties, more, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, virtue, of, chastity, the, song, dynasty, confucian, cheng, yi, stated, that, to, starve, to, death, is, a, small, matter, but, to, lose, one, s, chastity, is, a, great, matter, it, was, during, the, song, dynasty, that, the, value, of, chastity, was, so, severe, confucian, scholars, criminalized, the, remarriage, of, widows, widows, were, revered, and, memorialised, during, the, ming, and, qing, periods, the, principle, of, chaste, widowhood, was, made, an, official, institution, during, the, ming, dynasty, this, cult, of, chastity, accordingly, condemned, many, widows, to, poverty, and, loneliness, by, placing, a, social, stigma, on, remarriage, though, the, repercussions, for, widows, at, times, went, beyond, poverty, and, loneliness, as, for, some, the, preservation, of, chastity, resulted, in, suicide, the, ideal, of, a, chaste, widow, became, an, extremely, high, honor, and, esteem, especially, for, a, woman, who, chose, to, end, her, life, after, her, husband, s, death, many, instances, of, such, acts, were, recorded, in, biographies, of, virtuous, women, a, collection, of, stories, of, women, who, distinguished, themselves, by, committing, suicide, after, their, husband, s, deaths, to, guard, their, chastity, and, purity, though, it, can, be, contested, whether, all, these, instances, can, be, deemed, self, sacrificing, for, the, virtue, of, chastity, as, it, became, common, practice, for, women, to, be, forced, to, commit, suicide, after, their, husband, s, death, this, resulted, from, the, honor, which, chaste, widowhood, garnered, lending, itself, to, the, husband, s, family, as, well, as, his, clan, or, village, for, years, many, modern, scholars, have, regarded, confucianism, as, a, sexist, patriarchal, ideology, that, was, historically, damaging, to, chinese, women, 15, 16, it, has, also, been, argued, by, some, chinese, and, western, writers, that, the, rise, of, neo, confucianism, during, the, song, dynasty, had, led, to, a, decline, of, status, of, women, 10, 12, some, critics, have, also, accused, the, prominent, song, neo, confucian, scholar, zhu, xi, for, believing, in, the, inferiority, of, women, and, that, men, and, women, need, to, be, kept, strictly, separate, while, sima, guang, also, believed, that, women, should, remain, indoors, and, not, deal, with, the, matters, of, men, in, the, outside, world, 24, 25, finally, scholars, have, discussed, the, attitudes, toward, women, in, confucian, texts, such, as, analects, in, a, much, discussed, passage, women, are, grouped, together, with, small, people, meaning, people, of, low, status, or, low, morals, and, described, as, being, difficult, to, cultivate, or, deal, with, many, traditional, commentators, and, modern, scholars, have, debated, over, the, precise, meaning, of, the, passage, and, whether, confucius, referred, to, all, women, or, just, certain, groups, of, women, further, analysis, suggests, however, that, women, s, place, in, confucian, society, may, be, more, complex, during, the, han, dynasty, period, the, influential, confucian, text, lessons, for, women, was, written, by, ban, zhao, 45, 114, ce, to, instruct, her, daughters, how, to, be, proper, confucian, wives, and, mothers, that, is, to, be, silent, hard, working, and, compliant, she, stresses, the, complementarity, and, equal, importance, of, the, male, and, female, roles, according, to, yin, yang, theory, but, she, clearly, accepts, the, dominance, of, the, male, however, she, does, present, education, and, literary, power, as, important, for, women, in, later, dynasties, a, number, of, women, took, advantage, of, the, confucian, acknowledgment, of, education, to, become, independent, in, thought, joseph, a, adler, points, out, that, neo, confucian, writings, do, not, necessarily, reflect, either, the, prevailing, social, practices, or, the, scholars, own, attitudes, and, practices, in, regard, to, actual, women, matthew, sommers, has, also, indicated, that, the, qing, dynasty, government, began, to, realise, the, utopian, nature, of, enforcing, the, cult, of, chastity, and, began, to, allow, practices, such, as, widow, remarrying, to, stand, moreover, some, confucian, texts, like, dong, zhongshu, s, luxuriant, dew, of, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, have, passages, that, suggest, a, more, equal, relationship, between, a, husband, and, his, wife, more, recently, some, scholars, have, also, begun, to, discuss, the, viability, of, constructing, a, confucian, feminism, 4, 149, 160, ever, since, europeans, first, encountered, confucianism, the, issue, of, how, confucianism, should, be, classified, has, been, subject, to, debate, in, the, 16th, and, the, 17th, centuries, the, earliest, european, arrivals, in, china, the, christian, jesuits, considered, confucianism, to, be, an, ethical, system, not, a, religion, and, one, that, was, compatible, with, christianity, the, jesuits, including, matteo, ricci, saw, chinese, rituals, as, civil, rituals, that, could, co, exist, alongside, the, spiritual, rituals, of, catholicism, by, the, early, 18th, century, this, initial, portrayal, was, rejected, by, the, dominicans, and, franciscans, creating, a, dispute, among, catholics, in, east, asia, that, was, known, as, the, rites, controversy, the, dominicans, and, franciscans, argued, that, chinese, ancestral, worship, was, a, form, of, idolatry, that, was, contradictory, to, the, tenets, of, christianity, this, view, was, reinforced, by, pope, benedict, xiv, who, ordered, a, ban, on, chinese, rituals, though, this, ban, was, re, assessed, and, repealed, in, 1939, by, pope, pius, xii, provided, that, such, traditions, harmonize, with, the, true, and, authentic, spirit, of, the, liturgy, some, critics, view, confucianism, as, definitely, pantheistic, and, nontheistic, in, that, it, is, not, based, on, the, belief, in, the, supernatural, or, in, a, personal, god, existing, separate, from, the, temporal, plane, confucius, views, about, tian, and, about, the, divine, providence, ruling, the, world, can, be, found, above, in, this, page, and, in, analects, 6, 26, 7, 22, and, 9, 12, for, example, on, spirituality, confucius, said, to, chi, lu, one, of, his, students, you, are, not, yet, able, to, serve, men, how, can, you, serve, spirits, attributes, such, as, ancestor, worship, ritual, and, sacrifice, were, advocated, by, confucius, as, necessary, for, social, harmony, these, attributes, may, be, traced, to, the, traditional, chinese, folk, religion, scholars, recognise, that, classification, ultimately, depends, on, how, one, defines, religion, using, stricter, definitions, of, religion, confucianism, has, been, described, as, a, moral, science, or, philosophy, but, using, a, broader, definition, such, as, frederick, streng, s, characterisation, of, religion, as, a, means, of, ultimate, transformation, confucianism, could, be, described, as, a, sociopolitical, doctrine, having, religious, qualities, with, the, latter, definition, confucianism, is, religious, even, if, non, theistic, in, the, sense, that, it, performs, some, of, the, basic, psycho, social, functions, of, full, fledged, religions
