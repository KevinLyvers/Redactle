https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm
in, science, and, philosophy, a, paradigm, p, r, d, a, m, parr, dyme, is, a, distinct, set, of, concepts, or, thought, patterns, including, theories, research, methods, postulates, and, standards, for, what, constitute, legitimate, contributions, to, a, field, the, word, paradigm, is, greek, in, origin, meaning, pattern, paradigm, comes, from, greek, paradeigma, pattern, example, sample, from, the, verb, paradeiknumi, exhibit, represent, expose, and, that, from, para, beside, beyond, and, deiknumi, to, show, to, point, out, in, classical, greek, based, rhetoric, a, paradeigma, aims, to, provide, an, audience, with, an, illustration, of, a, similar, occurrence, this, illustration, is, not, meant, to, take, the, audience, to, a, conclusion, however, it, is, used, to, help, guide, them, to, get, there, one, way, of, how, a, paradeigma, is, meant, to, guide, an, audience, would, be, exemplified, by, the, role, of, a, personal, accountant, it, is, not, the, job, of, a, personal, accountant, to, tell, a, client, exactly, what, and, what, not, to, spend, money, on, but, to, aid, in, guiding, a, client, as, to, how, money, should, be, spent, based, on, the, client, s, financial, goals, anaximenes, defined, paradeigma, as, actions, that, have, occurred, previously, and, are, similar, to, or, the, opposite, of, those, which, we, are, now, discussing, the, original, greek, term, paradeigma, was, used, by, scribes, in, greek, texts, such, as, plato, s, dialogues, timaeus, and, parmenides, as, one, possibility, for, the, model, or, the, pattern, that, the, demiurge, supposedly, used, to, create, the, cosmos, the, english, language, term, paradigm, has, technical, meanings, in, the, fields, of, grammar, as, applied, for, example, to, declension, and, conjugation, the, 1900, merriam, webster, dictionary, defines, the, technical, use, of, paradigm, only, in, the, context, of, grammar, and, of, rhetoric, as, a, term, for, an, illustrative, parable, or, fable, in, linguistics, ferdinand, de, saussure, 1857, 1913, used, paradigm, to, refer, to, a, class, of, elements, with, similarities, as, opposed, to, syntagma, a, class, of, elements, expressing, relationship, the, merriam, webster, online, dictionary, defines, one, usage, of, paradigm, as, a, philosophical, and, theoretical, framework, of, a, scientific, school, or, discipline, within, which, theories, laws, and, generalizations, and, the, experiments, performed, in, support, of, them, are, formulated, broadly, a, philosophical, or, theoretical, framework, of, any, kind, the, oxford, dictionary, of, philosophy, 2008, attributes, the, following, description, of, the, term, in, the, history, and, philosophy, of, science, to, thomas, kuhn, s, 1962, work, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, kuhn, suggests, that, certain, scientific, works, such, as, newton, s, principia, or, john, dalton, s, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, 1808, provide, an, open, ended, resource, a, framework, of, concepts, results, and, procedures, within, which, subsequent, work, is, structured, normal, science, proceeds, within, such, a, framework, or, paradigm, a, paradigm, does, not, impose, a, rigid, or, mechanical, approach, but, can, be, taken, more, or, less, creatively, and, flexibly, the, oxford, english, dictionary, defines, a, paradigm, as, a, pattern, or, model, an, exemplar, a, typical, instance, of, something, an, example, the, historian, of, science, thomas, kuhn, gave, the, word, its, contemporary, meaning, when, he, adopted, the, word, to, refer, to, the, set, of, concepts, and, practices, that, define, a, scientific, discipline, at, any, particular, period, of, time, in, his, book, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, first, published, in, 1962, kuhn, defines, a, scientific, paradigm, as, universally, recognized, scientific, achievements, that, for, a, time, provide, model, problems, and, solutions, to, a, community, of, practitioners, i, e, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, kuhn, saw, the, sciences, as, going, through, alternating, periods, of, normal, science, when, an, existing, model, of, reality, dominates, a, protracted, period, of, puzzle, solving, and, revolution, when, the, model, of, reality, itself, undergoes, sudden, drastic, change, paradigms, have, two, aspects, firstly, within, normal, science, the, term, refers, to, the, set, of, exemplary, experiments, that, are, likely, to, be, copied, or, emulated, secondly, underpinning, this, set, of, exemplars, are, shared, preconceptions, made, prior, to, and, conditioning, the, collection, of, evidence, these, preconceptions, embody, both, hidden, assumptions, and, elements, that, kuhn, describes, as, quasi, metaphysical, the, interpretations, of, the, paradigm, may, vary, among, individual, scientists, kuhn, was, at, pains, to, point, out, that, the, rationale, for, the, choice, of, exemplars, is, a, specific, way, of, viewing, reality, that, view, and, the, status, of, exemplar, are, mutually, reinforcing, for, well, integrated, members, of, a, particular, discipline, its, paradigm, is, so, convincing, that, it, normally, renders, even, the, possibility, of, alternatives, unconvincing, and, counter, intuitive, such, a, paradigm, is, opaque, appearing, to, be, a, direct, view, of, the, bedrock, of, reality, itself, and, obscuring, the, possibility, that, there, might, be, other, alternative, imageries, hidden, behind, it, the, conviction, that, the, current, paradigm, is, reality, tends, to, disqualify, evidence, that, might, undermine, the, paradigm, itself, this, in, turn, leads, to, a, build, up, of, unreconciled, anomalies, it, is, the, latter, that, is, responsible, for, the, eventual, revolutionary, overthrow, of, the, incumbent, paradigm, and, its, replacement, by, a, new, one, kuhn, used, the, expression, paradigm, shift, see, below, for, this, process, and, likened, it, to, the, perceptual, change, that, occurs, when, our, interpretation, of, an, ambiguous, image, flips, over, from, one, state, to, another, the, rabbit, duck, illusion, is, an, example, it, is, not, possible, to, see, both, the, rabbit, and, the, duck, simultaneously, this, is, significant, in, relation, to, the, issue, of, incommensurability, see, below, an, example, of, a, currently, accepted, paradigm, would, be, the, standard, model, of, physics, the, scientific, method, allows, for, orthodox, scientific, investigations, into, phenomena, that, might, contradict, or, disprove, the, standard, model, however, grant, funding, would, be, proportionately, more, difficult, to, obtain, for, such, experiments, depending, on, the, degree, of, deviation, from, the, accepted, standard, model, theory, the, experiment, would, test, for, to, illustrate, the, point, an, experiment, to, test, for, the, mass, of, neutrinos, or, the, decay, of, protons, small, departures, from, the, model, is, more, likely, to, receive, money, than, experiments, that, look, for, the, violation, of, the, conservation, of, momentum, or, ways, to, engineer, reverse, time, travel, mechanisms, similar, to, the, original, kuhnian, paradigm, have, been, invoked, in, various, disciplines, other, than, the, philosophy, of, science, these, include, the, idea, of, major, cultural, themes, worldviews, and, see, below, ideologies, and, mindsets, they, have, somewhat, similar, meanings, that, apply, to, smaller, and, larger, scale, examples, of, disciplined, thought, in, addition, michel, foucault, used, the, terms, episteme, and, discourse, mathesis, and, taxinomia, for, aspects, of, a, paradigm, in, kuhn, s, original, sense, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, kuhn, wrote, that, the, successive, transition, from, one, paradigm, to, another, via, revolution, is, the, usual, developmental, pattern, of, mature, science, p, 12, paradigm, shifts, tend, to, appear, in, response, to, the, accumulation, of, critical, anomalies, as, well, as, in, the, form, of, the, proposal, of, a, new, theory, with, the, power, to, encompass, both, older, relevant, data, and, explain, relevant, anomalies, new, paradigms, tend, to, be, most, dramatic, in, sciences, that, appear, to, be, stable, and, mature, as, in, physics, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, at, that, time, a, statement, generally, attributed, to, physicist, lord, kelvin, famously, claimed, there, is, nothing, new, to, be, discovered, in, physics, now, all, that, remains, is, more, and, more, precise, measurement, five, years, later, albert, einstein, published, his, paper, on, special, relativity, which, challenged, the, set, of, rules, laid, down, by, newtonian, mechanics, which, had, been, used, to, describe, force, and, motion, for, over, two, hundred, years, in, this, case, the, new, paradigm, reduces, the, old, to, a, special, case, in, the, sense, that, newtonian, mechanics, is, still, a, good, model, for, approximation, for, speeds, that, are, slow, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, many, philosophers, and, historians, of, science, including, kuhn, himself, ultimately, accepted, a, modified, version, of, kuhn, s, model, which, synthesizes, his, original, view, with, the, gradualist, model, that, preceded, it, kuhn, s, original, model, is, now, generally, seen, as, too, limited, some, examples, of, contemporary, paradigm, shifts, include, kuhn, s, idea, was, itself, revolutionary, in, its, time, it, caused, a, major, change, in, the, way, that, academics, talk, about, science, and, so, it, may, be, that, it, caused, or, was, part, of, a, paradigm, shift, in, the, history, and, sociology, of, science, however, kuhn, would, not, recognize, such, a, paradigm, shift, being, in, the, social, sciences, people, can, still, use, earlier, ideas, to, discuss, the, history, of, science, perhaps, the, greatest, barrier, to, a, paradigm, shift, in, some, cases, is, the, reality, of, paradigm, paralysis, the, inability, or, refusal, to, see, beyond, the, current, models, of, thinking, this, is, similar, to, what, psychologists, term, confirmation, bias, and, the, semmelweis, reflex, examples, include, rejection, of, aristarchus, of, samos, copernicus, and, galileo, s, theory, of, a, heliocentric, solar, system, the, discovery, of, electrostatic, photography, xerography, and, the, quartz, clock, kuhn, pointed, out, that, it, could, be, difficult, to, assess, whether, a, particular, paradigm, shift, had, actually, led, to, progress, in, the, sense, of, explaining, more, facts, explaining, more, important, facts, or, providing, better, explanations, because, the, understanding, of, more, important, better, etc, changed, with, the, paradigm, the, two, versions, of, reality, are, thus, incommensurable, kuhn, s, version, of, incommensurability, has, an, important, psychological, dimension, this, is, apparent, from, his, analogy, between, a, paradigm, shift, and, the, flip, over, involved, in, some, optical, illusions, however, he, subsequently, diluted, his, commitment, to, incommensurability, considerably, partly, in, the, light, of, other, studies, of, scientific, development, that, did, not, involve, revolutionary, change, one, of, the, examples, of, incommensurability, that, kuhn, used, was, the, change, in, the, style, of, chemical, investigations, that, followed, the, work, of, lavoisier, on, atomic, theory, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, this, change, the, focus, had, shifted, from, the, bulk, properties, of, matter, such, as, hardness, colour, reactivity, etc, to, studies, of, atomic, weights, and, quantitative, studies, of, reactions, he, suggested, that, it, was, impossible, to, make, the, comparison, needed, to, judge, which, body, of, knowledge, was, better, or, more, advanced, however, this, change, in, research, style, and, paradigm, eventually, after, more, than, a, century, led, to, a, theory, of, atomic, structure, that, accounts, well, for, the, bulk, properties, of, matter, see, for, example, brady, s, general, chemistry, according, to, p, j, smith, this, ability, of, science, to, back, off, move, sideways, and, then, advance, is, characteristic, of, the, natural, sciences, but, contrasts, with, the, position, in, some, social, sciences, notably, economics, this, apparent, ability, does, not, guarantee, that, the, account, is, veridical, at, any, one, time, of, course, and, most, modern, philosophers, of, science, are, fallibilists, however, members, of, other, disciplines, do, see, the, issue, of, incommensurability, as, a, much, greater, obstacle, to, evaluations, of, progress, see, for, example, martin, slattery, s, key, ideas, in, sociology, opaque, kuhnian, paradigms, and, paradigm, shifts, do, exist, a, few, years, after, the, discovery, of, the, mirror, neurons, that, provide, a, hard, wired, basis, for, the, human, capacity, for, empathy, the, scientists, involved, were, unable, to, identify, the, incidents, that, had, directed, their, attention, to, the, issue, over, the, course, of, the, investigation, their, language, and, metaphors, had, changed, so, that, they, themselves, could, no, longer, interpret, all, of, their, own, earlier, laboratory, notes, and, records, however, many, instances, exist, in, which, change, in, a, discipline, s, core, model, of, reality, has, happened, in, a, more, evolutionary, manner, with, individual, scientists, exploring, the, usefulness, of, alternatives, in, a, way, that, would, not, be, possible, if, they, were, constrained, by, a, paradigm, imre, lakatos, suggested, as, an, alternative, to, kuhn, s, formulation, that, scientists, actually, work, within, research, programmes, in, lakatos, sense, a, research, programme, is, a, sequence, of, problems, placed, in, order, of, priority, this, set, of, priorities, and, the, associated, set, of, preferred, techniques, is, the, positive, heuristic, of, a, programme, each, programme, also, has, a, negative, heuristic, this, consists, of, a, set, of, fundamental, assumptions, that, temporarily, at, least, takes, priority, over, observational, evidence, when, the, two, appear, to, conflict, this, latter, aspect, of, research, programmes, is, inherited, from, kuhn, s, work, on, paradigms, and, represents, an, important, departure, from, the, elementary, account, of, how, science, works, according, to, this, science, proceeds, through, repeated, cycles, of, observation, induction, hypothesis, testing, etc, with, the, test, of, consistency, with, empirical, evidence, being, imposed, at, each, stage, paradigms, and, research, programmes, allow, anomalies, to, be, set, aside, where, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, they, arise, from, incomplete, knowledge, about, either, the, substantive, topic, or, some, aspect, of, the, theories, implicitly, used, in, making, observations, larry, laudan, has, also, made, two, important, contributions, to, the, debate, laudan, believed, that, something, akin, to, paradigms, exist, in, the, social, sciences, kuhn, had, contested, this, see, below, he, referred, to, these, as, research, traditions, laudan, noted, that, some, anomalies, become, dormant, if, they, survive, a, long, period, during, which, no, competing, alternative, has, shown, itself, capable, of, resolving, the, anomaly, he, also, presented, cases, in, which, a, dominant, paradigm, had, withered, away, because, its, lost, credibility, when, viewed, against, changes, in, the, wider, intellectual, milieu, kuhn, himself, did, not, consider, the, concept, of, paradigm, as, appropriate, for, the, social, sciences, he, explains, in, his, preface, to, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, that, he, developed, the, concept, of, paradigm, precisely, to, distinguish, the, social, from, the, natural, sciences, while, visiting, the, center, for, advanced, study, in, the, behavioral, sciences, in, 1958, and, 1959, surrounded, by, social, scientists, he, observed, that, they, were, never, in, agreement, about, the, nature, of, legitimate, scientific, problems, and, methods, he, explains, that, he, wrote, this, book, precisely, to, show, that, there, can, never, be, any, paradigms, in, the, social, sciences, mattei, dogan, a, french, sociologist, in, his, article, paradigms, in, the, social, sciences, develops, kuhn, s, original, thesis, that, there, are, no, paradigms, at, all, in, the, social, sciences, since, the, concepts, are, polysemic, involving, the, deliberate, mutual, ignorance, between, scholars, and, the, proliferation, of, schools, in, these, disciplines, dogan, provides, many, examples, of, the, non, existence, of, paradigms, in, the, social, sciences, in, his, essay, particularly, in, sociology, political, science, and, political, anthropology, however, both, kuhn, s, original, work, and, dogan, s, commentary, are, directed, at, disciplines, that, are, defined, by, conventional, labels, such, as, sociology, while, it, is, true, that, such, broad, groupings, in, the, social, sciences, are, usually, not, based, on, a, kuhnian, paradigm, each, of, the, competing, sub, disciplines, may, still, be, underpinned, by, a, paradigm, research, programme, research, tradition, and, or, professional, imagery, these, structures, will, be, motivating, research, providing, it, with, an, agenda, defining, what, is, and, is, not, anomalous, evidence, and, inhibiting, debate, with, other, groups, that, fall, under, the, same, broad, disciplinary, label, a, good, example, is, provided, by, the, contrast, between, skinnerian, radical, behaviourism, and, personal, construct, theory, pct, within, psychology, the, most, significant, of, the, many, ways, these, two, sub, disciplines, of, psychology, differ, concerns, meanings, and, intentions, in, pct, they, are, seen, as, the, central, concern, of, psychology, in, radical, behaviourism, they, are, not, scientific, evidence, at, all, as, they, cannot, be, directly, observed, such, considerations, explain, the, conflict, between, the, kuhn, dogan, view, and, the, views, of, others, including, larry, laudan, see, above, who, do, apply, these, concepts, to, social, sciences, handa, m, l, 1986, introduced, the, idea, of, social, paradigm, in, the, context, of, social, sciences, he, identified, the, basic, components, of, a, social, paradigm, like, kuhn, handa, addressed, the, issue, of, changing, paradigm, the, process, popularly, known, as, paradigm, shift, in, this, respect, he, focused, on, social, circumstances, that, precipitate, such, a, shift, and, the, effects, of, the, shift, on, social, institutions, including, the, institution, of, education, this, broad, shift, in, the, social, arena, in, turn, changes, the, way, the, individual, perceives, reality, another, use, of, the, word, paradigm, is, in, the, sense, of, worldview, for, example, in, social, science, the, term, is, used, to, describe, the, set, of, experiences, beliefs, and, values, that, affect, the, way, an, individual, perceives, reality, and, responds, to, that, perception, social, scientists, have, adopted, the, kuhnian, phrase, paradigm, shift, to, denote, a, change, in, how, a, given, society, goes, about, organizing, and, understanding, reality, a, dominant, paradigm, refers, to, the, values, or, system, of, thought, in, a, society, that, are, most, standard, and, widely, held, at, a, given, time, dominant, paradigms, are, shaped, both, by, the, community, s, cultural, background, and, by, the, context, of, the, historical, moment, hutchin, outlines, some, conditions, that, facilitate, a, system, of, thought, to, become, an, accepted, dominant, paradigm, the, word, paradigm, is, also, still, used, to, indicate, a, pattern, or, model, or, an, outstandingly, clear, or, typical, example, or, archetype, the, term, is, frequently, used, in, this, sense, in, the, design, professions, design, paradigms, or, archetypes, comprise, functional, precedents, for, design, solutions, the, best, known, references, on, design, paradigms, are, design, paradigms, a, sourcebook, for, creative, visualization, by, wake, and, design, paradigms, by, petroski, this, term, is, also, used, in, cybernetics, here, it, means, in, a, very, wide, sense, a, conceptual, protoprogram, for, reducing, the, chaotic, mass, to, some, form, of, order, note, the, similarities, to, the, concept, of, entropy, in, chemistry, and, physics, a, paradigm, there, would, be, a, sort, of, prohibition, to, proceed, with, any, action, that, would, increase, the, total, entropy, of, the, system, to, create, a, paradigm, requires, a, closed, system, that, accepts, changes, thus, a, paradigm, can, only, apply, to, a, system, that, is, not, in, its, final, stage, beyond, its, use, in, the, physical, and, social, sciences, kuhn, s, paradigm, concept, has, been, analysed, in, relation, to, its, applicability, in, identifying, paradigms, with, respect, to, worldviews, at, specific, points, in, history, one, example, is, matthew, edward, harris, book, the, notion, of, papal, monarchy, in, the, thirteenth, century, the, idea, of, paradigm, in, church, history, harris, stresses, the, primarily, sociological, importance, of, paradigms, pointing, towards, kuhn, s, second, edition, of, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, although, obedience, to, popes, such, as, innocent, iii, and, boniface, viii, was, widespread, even, written, testimony, from, the, time, showing, loyalty, to, the, pope, does, not, demonstrate, that, the, writer, had, the, same, worldview, as, the, church, and, therefore, pope, at, the, centre, the, difference, between, paradigms, in, the, physical, sciences, and, in, historical, organisations, such, as, the, church, is, that, the, former, unlike, the, latter, requires, technical, expertise, rather, than, repeating, statements, in, other, words, after, scientific, training, through, what, kuhn, calls, exemplars, one, could, not, genuinely, believe, that, to, take, a, trivial, example, the, earth, is, flat, whereas, thinkers, such, as, giles, of, rome, in, the, thirteenth, century, wrote, in, favour, of, the, pope, then, could, easily, write, similarly, glowing, things, about, the, king, a, writer, such, as, giles, would, have, wanted, a, good, job, from, the, pope, he, was, a, papal, publicist, however, harris, writes, that, scientific, group, membership, is, not, concerned, with, desire, emotions, gain, loss, and, any, idealistic, notions, concerning, the, nature, and, destiny, of, humankind, but, simply, to, do, with, aptitude, explanation, cold, description, of, the, facts, of, the, world, and, the, universe, from, within, a, paradigm
