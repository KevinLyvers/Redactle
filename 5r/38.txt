relativism, is, a, family, of, philosophical, views, which, deny, claims, to, objectivity, within, a, particular, domain, and, assert, that, valuations, in, that, domain, are, relative, to, the, perspective, of, an, observer, or, the, context, in, which, they, are, assessed, there, are, many, different, forms, of, relativism, with, a, great, deal, of, variation, in, scope, and, differing, degrees, of, controversy, among, them, moral, relativism, encompasses, the, differences, in, moral, judgments, among, people, and, cultures, epistemic, relativism, holds, that, there, are, no, absolute, principles, regarding, normative, belief, justification, or, rationality, and, that, there, are, only, relative, ones, alethic, relativism, also, factual, relativism, is, the, doctrine, that, there, are, no, absolute, truths, i, e, that, truth, is, always, relative, to, some, particular, frame, of, reference, such, as, a, language, or, a, culture, cultural, relativism, some, forms, of, relativism, also, bear, a, resemblance, to, philosophical, skepticism, descriptive, relativism, seeks, to, describe, the, differences, among, cultures, and, people, without, evaluation, while, normative, relativism, evaluates, the, word, truthfulness, of, views, within, a, given, framework, anthropological, relativism, refers, to, a, methodological, stance, in, which, the, researcher, suspends, or, brackets, their, own, cultural, prejudice, while, trying, to, understand, beliefs, or, behaviors, in, their, contexts, this, has, become, known, as, methodological, relativism, and, concerns, itself, specifically, with, avoiding, ethnocentrism, or, the, application, of, one, s, own, cultural, standards, to, the, assessment, of, other, cultures, this, is, also, the, basis, of, the, so, called, emic, and, etic, distinction, in, which, philosophical, relativism, in, contrast, asserts, that, the, truth, of, a, proposition, depends, on, the, metaphysical, or, theoretical, frame, or, the, instrumental, method, or, the, context, in, which, the, proposition, is, expressed, or, on, the, person, groups, or, culture, who, interpret, the, proposition, methodological, relativism, and, philosophical, relativism, can, exist, independently, from, one, another, but, most, anthropologists, base, their, methodological, relativism, on, that, of, the, philosophical, variety, the, concept, of, relativism, also, has, importance, both, for, philosophers, and, for, anthropologists, in, another, way, in, general, anthropologists, engage, in, descriptive, relativism, how, things, are, or, how, things, seem, whereas, philosophers, engage, in, normative, relativism, how, things, ought, to, be, although, there, is, some, overlap, for, example, descriptive, relativism, can, pertain, to, concepts, normative, relativism, to, truth, descriptive, relativism, assumes, that, certain, cultural, groups, have, different, modes, of, thought, standards, of, reasoning, and, so, forth, and, it, is, the, anthropologist, s, task, to, describe, but, not, to, evaluate, the, validity, of, these, principles, and, practices, of, a, cultural, group, it, is, possible, for, an, anthropologist, in, his, or, her, fieldwork, to, be, a, descriptive, relativist, about, some, things, that, typically, concern, the, philosopher, e, g, ethical, principles, but, not, about, others, e, g, logical, principles, however, the, descriptive, relativist, s, empirical, claims, about, epistemic, principles, moral, ideals, and, the, like, are, often, countered, by, anthropological, arguments, that, such, things, are, universal, and, much, of, the, recent, literature, on, these, matters, is, explicitly, concerned, with, the, extent, of, and, evidence, for, cultural, or, moral, or, linguistic, or, human, universals, the, fact, that, the, various, species, of, descriptive, relativism, are, empirical, claims, may, tempt, the, philosopher, to, conclude, that, they, are, of, little, philosophical, interest, but, there, are, several, reasons, why, this, is, not, so, first, some, philosophers, notably, kant, argue, that, certain, sorts, of, cognitive, differences, between, human, beings, or, even, all, rational, beings, are, impossible, so, such, differences, could, never, be, found, to, obtain, in, fact, an, argument, that, places, a, priori, limits, on, what, empirical, inquiry, could, discover, and, on, what, versions, of, descriptive, relativism, could, be, true, second, claims, about, actual, differences, between, groups, play, a, central, role, in, some, arguments, for, normative, relativism, for, example, arguments, for, normative, ethical, relativism, often, begin, with, claims, that, different, groups, in, fact, have, different, moral, codes, or, ideals, finally, the, anthropologist, s, descriptive, account, of, relativism, helps, to, separate, the, fixed, aspects, of, human, nature, from, those, that, can, vary, and, so, a, descriptive, claim, that, some, important, aspect, of, experience, or, thought, does, or, does, not, vary, across, groups, of, human, beings, tells, us, something, important, about, human, nature, and, the, human, condition, normative, relativism, concerns, normative, or, evaluative, claims, that, modes, of, thought, standards, of, reasoning, or, the, like, are, only, right, or, wrong, relative, to, a, framework, normative, is, meant, in, a, general, sense, applying, to, a, wide, range, of, views, in, the, case, of, beliefs, for, example, normative, correctness, equals, truth, this, does, not, mean, of, course, that, framework, relative, correctness, or, truth, is, always, clear, the, first, challenge, being, to, explain, what, it, amounts, to, in, any, given, case, e, g, with, respect, to, concepts, truth, epistemic, norms, normative, relativism, say, in, regard, to, normative, ethical, relativism, therefore, implies, that, things, say, ethical, claims, are, not, simply, true, in, themselves, but, only, have, truth, values, relative, to, broader, frameworks, say, moral, codes, many, normative, ethical, relativist, arguments, run, from, premises, about, ethics, to, conclusions, that, assert, the, relativity, of, truth, values, bypassing, general, claims, about, the, nature, of, truth, but, it, is, often, more, illuminating, to, consider, the, type, of, relativism, under, question, directly, in, english, common, law, two, perhaps, three, separate, standards, of, proof, are, recognized, relationism, is, the, theory, that, there, are, only, relations, between, individual, entities, and, no, intrinsic, properties, despite, the, similarity, in, name, it, is, held, by, some, to, be, a, position, distinct, from, relativism, for, instance, because, statements, about, relational, properties, assert, an, absolute, truth, about, things, in, the, world, on, the, other, hand, others, wish, to, equate, relativism, relationism, and, even, relativity, which, is, a, precise, theory, of, relationships, between, physical, objects, nevertheless, this, confluence, of, relativity, theory, with, relativism, became, a, strong, contributing, factor, in, the, increasing, prominence, of, relativism, whereas, previous, investigations, of, science, only, sought, sociological, or, psychological, explanations, of, failed, scientific, theories, or, pathological, science, the, strong, programme, is, more, relativistic, assessing, scientific, truth, and, falsehood, equally, in, a, historic, and, cultural, context, a, common, argument, against, relativism, suggests, that, it, inherently, refutes, itself, the, statement, all, is, relative, classes, either, as, a, relative, statement, or, as, an, absolute, one, if, it, is, relative, then, this, statement, does, not, rule, out, absolutes, if, the, statement, is, absolute, on, the, other, hand, then, it, provides, an, example, of, an, absolute, statement, proving, that, not, all, truths, are, relative, however, this, argument, against, relativism, only, applies, to, relativism, that, positions, truth, as, relative, i, e, epistemological, truth, value, relativism, more, specifically, it, is, only, extreme, forms, of, epistemological, relativism, that, can, come, in, for, this, criticism, as, there, are, many, epistemological, relativists, who, posit, that, some, aspects, of, what, is, regarded, as, factually, true, are, not, universal, yet, still, accept, that, other, universal, truths, exist, e, g, gas, laws, or, moral, laws, another, argument, against, relativism, posits, a, natural, law, simply, put, the, physical, universe, works, under, basic, principles, the, laws, of, nature, some, contend, that, a, natural, moral, law, may, also, exist, for, example, as, argued, by, immanuel, kant, in, critique, of, practical, reason, richard, dawkins, in, the, god, delusion, 2006, and, addressed, by, c, s, lewis, in, mere, christianity, 1952, dawkins, said, i, think, we, face, an, equal, but, much, more, sinister, challenge, from, the, left, in, the, shape, of, cultural, relativism, the, view, that, scientific, truth, is, only, one, kind, of, truth, and, it, is, not, to, be, especially, privileged, philosopher, hilary, putnam, among, others, states, that, some, forms, of, relativism, make, it, impossible, to, believe, one, is, in, error, if, there, is, no, truth, beyond, an, individual, s, belief, that, something, is, true, then, an, individual, cannot, hold, their, own, beliefs, to, be, false, or, mistaken, a, related, criticism, is, that, relativizing, truth, to, individuals, destroys, the, distinction, between, truth, and, belief, sophists, are, considered, the, founding, fathers, of, relativism, in, western, philosophy, elements, of, relativism, emerged, among, the, sophists, in, the, 5th, century, bc, notably, it, was, protagoras, who, coined, the, phrase, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, of, things, which, are, that, they, are, and, of, things, which, are, not, that, they, are, not, the, thinking, of, the, sophists, is, mainly, known, through, their, opponent, plato, in, a, paraphrase, from, plato, s, dialogue, theaetetus, protagoras, said, what, is, true, for, you, is, true, for, you, and, what, is, true, for, me, is, true, for, me, bernard, crick, a, british, political, scientist, and, advocate, of, relativism, suggested, in, in, defence, of, politics, 1962, that, moral, conflict, between, people, is, inevitable, he, thought, that, only, ethics, can, resolve, such, conflict, and, when, that, occurs, in, public, it, results, in, politics, accordingly, crick, saw, the, process, of, dispute, resolution, harms, reduction, mediation, or, peacemaking, as, central, to, all, of, moral, philosophy, he, became, an, important, influence, on, feminists, and, later, on, the, greens, philosopher, of, science, paul, feyerabend, is, often, considered, to, be, a, relativist, although, he, denied, being, one, feyerabend, argued, that, modern, science, suffers, from, being, methodologically, monistic, the, belief, that, only, a, single, methodology, can, produce, scientific, progress, feyerabend, summarises, his, case, in, against, method, with, the, phrase, anything, goes, thomas, kuhn, s, philosophy, of, science, as, expressed, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, is, often, interpreted, as, relativistic, he, claimed, that, as, well, as, progressing, steadily, and, incrementally, normal, science, science, undergoes, periodic, revolutions, or, paradigm, shifts, leaving, scientists, working, in, different, paradigms, with, difficulty, in, even, communicating, thus, the, truth, of, a, claim, or, the, existence, of, a, posited, entity, is, relative, to, the, paradigm, employed, however, it, is, not, necessary, for, him, to, embrace, relativism, because, every, paradigm, presupposes, the, prior, building, upon, itself, through, history, and, so, on, this, leads, to, there, being, a, fundamental, incremental, and, referential, structure, of, development, which, is, not, relative, but, again, fundamental, but, kuhn, rejected, the, accusation, of, being, a, relativist, later, in, his, postscript, some, have, argued, that, one, can, also, read, kuhn, s, work, as, essentially, positivist, in, its, ontology, the, revolutions, he, posits, are, epistemological, lurching, toward, a, presumably, better, understanding, of, an, objective, reality, through, the, lens, presented, by, the, new, paradigm, however, a, number, of, passages, in, structure, do, indeed, appear, to, be, distinctly, relativist, and, to, directly, challenge, the, notion, of, an, objective, reality, and, the, ability, of, science, to, progress, towards, an, ever, greater, grasp, of, it, particularly, through, the, process, of, paradigm, change, george, lakoff, and, mark, johnson, define, relativism, in, metaphors, we, live, by, as, the, rejection, of, both, subjectivism, and, metaphysical, objectivism, in, order, to, focus, on, the, relationship, between, them, i, e, the, metaphor, by, which, we, relate, our, current, experience, to, our, previous, experience, in, particular, lakoff, and, johnson, characterize, objectivism, as, a, straw, man, and, to, a, lesser, degree, criticize, the, views, of, karl, popper, kant, and, aristotle, in, his, book, invariances, robert, nozick, expresses, a, complex, set, of, theories, about, the, absolute, and, the, relative, he, thinks, the, absolute, relative, distinction, should, be, recast, in, terms, of, an, invariant, variant, distinction, where, there, are, many, things, a, proposition, can, be, invariant, with, regard, to, or, vary, with, he, thinks, it, is, coherent, for, truth, to, be, relative, and, speculates, that, it, might, vary, with, time, he, thinks, necessity, is, an, unobtainable, notion, but, can, be, approximated, by, robust, invariance, across, a, variety, of, conditions, although, we, can, never, identify, a, proposition, that, is, invariant, with, regard, to, everything, finally, he, is, not, particularly, warm, to, one, of, the, most, famous, forms, of, relativism, moral, relativism, preferring, an, evolutionary, account, joseph, margolis, advocates, a, view, he, calls, robust, relativism, and, defends, it, in, his, books, historied, thought, constructed, world, chapter, 4, california, 1995, and, the, truth, about, relativism, blackwell, 1991, he, opens, his, account, by, stating, that, our, logics, should, depend, on, what, we, take, to, be, the, nature, of, the, sphere, to, which, we, wish, to, apply, our, logics, holding, that, there, can, be, no, distinctions, which, are, not, privileged, between, the, alethic, the, ontic, and, the, epistemic, he, maintains, that, a, many, valued, logic, just, might, be, the, most, apt, for, aesthetics, or, history, since, because, in, these, practices, we, are, loath, to, hold, to, simple, binary, logic, and, he, also, holds, that, many, valued, logic, is, relativistic, this, is, perhaps, an, unusual, definition, of, relativistic, compare, with, his, comments, on, relationism, to, say, that, true, and, false, are, mutually, exclusive, and, exhaustive, judgements, on, hamlet, for, instance, really, does, seem, absurd, a, many, valued, logic, with, its, values, apt, reasonable, likely, and, so, on, seems, intuitively, more, applicable, to, interpreting, hamlet, where, apparent, contradictions, arise, between, such, interpretations, we, might, call, the, interpretations, incongruent, rather, than, dubbing, either, of, them, false, because, using, many, valued, logic, implies, that, a, measured, value, is, a, mixture, of, two, extreme, possibilities, using, the, subset, of, many, valued, logic, fuzzy, logic, it, can, be, said, that, various, interpretations, can, be, represented, by, membership, in, more, than, one, possible, truth, set, simultaneously, fuzzy, logic, is, therefore, probably, the, best, mathematical, structure, for, understanding, robust, relativism, and, has, been, interpreted, by, bart, kosko, as, philosophically, being, related, to, zen, buddhism, it, was, aristotle, who, held, that, relativism, implies, that, we, should, sticking, with, appearances, only, end, up, contradicting, ourselves, somewhere, if, we, could, apply, all, attributes, to, all, ousiai, beings, aristotle, however, made, non, contradiction, dependent, upon, his, essentialism, if, his, essentialism, is, false, then, so, too, is, his, ground, for, disallowing, relativism, subsequent, philosophers, have, found, other, reasons, for, supporting, the, principle, of, non, contradiction, beginning, with, protagoras, and, invoking, charles, sanders, peirce, margolis, shows, that, the, historic, struggle, to, discredit, relativism, is, an, attempt, to, impose, an, unexamined, belief, in, the, world, s, essentially, rigid, rule, like, nature, plato, and, aristotle, merely, attacked, relationalism, the, doctrine, of, true, for, l, or, true, for, k, and, the, like, where, l, and, k, are, different, speakers, or, different, worlds, or, something, similar, most, philosophers, would, call, this, position, relativism, for, margolis, true, means, true, that, is, the, alethic, use, of, true, remains, untouched, however, in, real, world, contexts, and, context, is, ubiquitous, in, the, real, world, we, must, apply, truth, values, here, in, epistemic, terms, we, might, tout, court, retire, true, as, an, evaluation, and, keep, false, the, rest, of, our, value, judgements, could, be, graded, from, extremely, plausible, down, to, false, judgements, which, on, a, bivalent, logic, would, be, incompatible, or, contradictory, are, further, seen, as, incongruent, although, one, may, well, have, more, weight, than, the, other, in, short, relativistic, logic, is, not, or, need, not, be, the, bugbear, it, is, often, presented, to, be, it, may, simply, be, the, best, type, of, logic, to, apply, to, certain, very, uncertain, spheres, of, real, experiences, in, the, world, although, some, sort, of, logic, needs, to, be, applied, in, order, to, make, that, judgement, those, who, swear, by, bivalent, logic, might, simply, be, the, ultimate, keepers, of, the, great, fear, of, the, flux, philosopher, richard, rorty, has, a, somewhat, paradoxical, role, in, the, debate, over, relativism, he, is, criticized, for, his, relativistic, views, by, many, commentators, but, has, always, denied, that, relativism, applies, to, much, anybody, being, nothing, more, than, a, platonic, scarecrow, rorty, claims, rather, that, he, is, a, pragmatist, and, that, to, construe, pragmatism, as, relativism, is, to, beg, the, question, rorty, takes, a, deflationary, attitude, to, truth, believing, there, is, nothing, of, interest, to, be, said, about, truth, in, general, including, the, contention, that, it, is, generally, subjective, he, also, argues, that, the, notion, of, warrant, or, justification, can, do, most, of, the, work, traditionally, assigned, to, the, concept, of, truth, and, that, justification, is, relative, justification, is, justification, to, an, audience, for, rorty, in, contingency, irony, and, solidarity, he, argues, that, the, debate, between, so, called, relativists, and, so, called, objectivists, is, beside, the, point, because, they, do, not, have, enough, premises, in, common, for, either, side, to, prove, anything, to, the, other, in, his, book, mage, lokaya, my, world, 1986, nalin, de, silva, criticized, the, basis, of, the, established, western, system, of, knowledge, and, its, propagation, which, he, refers, as, domination, throughout, the, world, he, explained, in, this, book, that, mind, independent, reality, is, impossible, and, knowledge, is, not, found, but, constructed, further, he, has, introduced, and, developed, the, concept, of, constructive, relativism, as, the, basis, on, which, knowledge, is, constructed, relative, to, the, sense, organs, culture, and, the, mind, completely, based, on, avidya, in, his, final, book, metaphors, for, the, mind, the, creative, mind, and, its, origins, 1991, colin, murray, turbayne, joins, the, debate, about, relativism, and, realism, by, providing, an, analysis, of, the, manner, in, which, platonic, metaphors, which, were, first, presented, in, the, procreation, model, of, the, timaeus, dialogue, have, evolved, over, time, to, influence, the, philosophical, works, of, both, george, berkeley, and, emmanuel, kant, in, addition, he, illustrates, the, manner, in, which, these, ancient, greek, metaphors, have, subsequently, evolved, to, impact, the, development, of, the, theories, of, substance, and, attribute, which, in, turn, have, dominated, the, development, of, human, thought, and, language, in, the, 20th, century, in, his, the, myth, of, metaphor, 1962, turbayne, argues, that, it, is, perfectly, possible, to, transcend, the, limitations, which, are, inherent, in, such, metaphors, including, those, incorporated, within, the, framework, of, classical, objective, mechanistic, newtonian, cosmology, and, scientific, materialism, in, general, in, turbayne, s, view, one, can, strive, to, embrace, a, more, satisfactory, epistemology, by, first, acknowledging, the, limitations, imposed, by, such, metaphorical, systems, this, can, readily, be, accomplished, by, restoring, plato, s, metaphorical, model, to, its, original, state, in, which, both, male, and, female, aspects, of, the, mind, work, in, concert, within, the, context, of, a, harmonious, balance, during, the, process, of, creation, the, term, relativism, often, comes, up, in, debates, over, postmodernism, poststructuralism, and, phenomenology, critics, of, these, perspectives, often, identify, advocates, with, the, label, relativism, for, example, the, sapir, whorf, hypothesis, is, often, considered, a, relativist, view, because, it, posits, that, linguistic, categories, and, structures, shape, the, way, people, view, the, world, stanley, fish, has, defended, postmodernism, and, relativism, these, perspectives, do, not, strictly, count, as, relativist, in, the, philosophical, sense, because, they, express, agnosticism, on, the, nature, of, reality, and, make, epistemological, rather, than, ontological, claims, nevertheless, the, term, is, useful, to, differentiate, them, from, realists, who, believe, that, the, purpose, of, philosophy, science, or, literary, critique, is, to, locate, externally, true, meanings, important, philosophers, and, theorists, such, as, michel, foucault, max, stirner, political, movements, such, as, post, anarchism, or, post, marxism, can, also, be, considered, as, relativist, in, this, sense, though, a, better, term, might, be, social, constructivist, the, spread, and, popularity, of, this, kind, of, soft, relativism, varies, between, academic, disciplines, it, has, wide, support, in, anthropology, and, has, a, majority, following, in, cultural, studies, it, also, has, advocates, in, political, theory, and, political, science, sociology, and, continental, philosophy, as, distinct, from, anglo, american, analytical, philosophy, it, has, inspired, empirical, studies, of, the, social, construction, of, meaning, such, as, those, associated, with, labelling, theory, which, defenders, can, point, to, as, evidence, of, the, validity, of, their, theories, albeit, risking, accusations, of, performative, contradiction, in, the, process, advocates, of, this, kind, of, relativism, often, also, claim, that, recent, developments, in, the, natural, sciences, such, as, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, quantum, mechanics, chaos, theory, and, complexity, theory, show, that, science, is, now, becoming, relativistic, however, many, scientists, who, use, these, methods, continue, to, identify, as, realist, or, post, positivist, and, some, sharply, criticize, the, association, madhyamaka, buddhism, which, forms, the, basis, for, many, mahayana, buddhist, schools, and, which, was, founded, by, n, g, rjuna, n, g, rjuna, taught, the, idea, of, relativity, in, the, ratn, val, he, gives, the, example, that, shortness, exists, only, in, relation, to, the, idea, of, length, the, determination, of, a, thing, or, object, is, only, possible, in, relation, to, other, things, or, objects, especially, by, way, of, contrast, he, held, that, the, relationship, between, the, ideas, of, short, and, long, is, not, due, to, intrinsic, nature, svabh, va, this, idea, is, also, found, in, the, pali, nik, yas, and, chinese, gamas, in, which, the, idea, of, relativity, is, expressed, similarly, that, which, is, the, element, of, light, is, seen, to, exist, on, account, of, darkness, that, which, is, the, element, of, good, is, seen, to, exist, on, account, of, bad, that, which, is, the, element, of, space, is, seen, to, exist, on, account, of, form, madhyamaka, buddhism, discerns, two, levels, of, truth, relative, and, ultimate, the, two, truths, doctrine, states, that, there, are, relative, or, conventional, common, sense, truth, which, describes, our, daily, experience, of, a, concrete, world, and, ultimate, truth, which, describes, the, ultimate, reality, as, sunyata, empty, of, concrete, and, inherent, characteristics, conventional, truth, may, be, understood, in, contrast, as, obscurative, truth, or, that, which, obscures, the, true, nature, it, is, constituted, by, the, appearances, of, mistaken, awareness, conventional, truth, would, be, the, appearance, that, includes, a, duality, of, apprehender, and, apprehended, and, objects, perceived, within, that, ultimate, truth, is, the, phenomenal, world, free, from, the, duality, of, apprehender, and, apprehended, the, catholic, church, especially, under, john, paul, ii, and, pope, benedict, xvi, has, identified, relativism, as, one, of, the, most, significant, problems, for, faith, and, morals, today, according, to, the, church, and, to, some, theologians, relativism, as, a, denial, of, absolute, truth, leads, to, moral, license, and, a, denial, of, the, possibility, of, sin, and, of, god, whether, moral, or, epistemological, relativism, constitutes, a, denial, of, the, capacity, of, the, human, mind, and, reason, to, arrive, at, truth, truth, according, to, catholic, theologians, and, philosophers, following, aristotle, consists, of, adequatio, rei, et, intellectus, the, correspondence, of, the, mind, and, reality, another, way, of, putting, it, states, that, the, mind, has, the, same, form, as, reality, this, means, when, the, form, of, the, computer, in, front, of, someone, the, type, color, shape, capacity, etc, is, also, the, form, that, is, in, their, mind, then, what, they, know, is, true, because, their, mind, corresponds, to, objective, reality, the, denial, of, an, absolute, reference, of, an, axis, mundi, denies, god, who, equates, to, absolute, truth, according, to, these, christian, theologians, they, link, relativism, to, secularism, an, obstruction, of, religion, in, human, life, pope, leo, xiii, 1810, 1903, was, the, first, known, pope, to, use, the, word, relativism, in, his, encyclical, humanum, genus, 1884, leo, condemned, freemasonry, and, claimed, that, its,
