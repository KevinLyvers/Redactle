and, shur, genesis, 16, 7, 16, describes, the, naming, of, ishmael, and, god, s, promise, to, hagar, concerning, ishmael, and, his, descendants, this, occurred, at, the, well, of, beer, lahai, roi, where, hagar, encountered, the, angel, of, the, lord, who, said, to, her, behold, you, are, with, child, and, shall, bear, a, son, you, shall, call, him, ishmael, for, the, lord, has, paid, heed, to, your, suffering, the, angel, commanded, hagar, return, to, your, mistress, and, submit, to, her, abraham, was, blessed, so, that, his, descendants, would, be, as, numerous, as, the, stars, in, the, sky, god, would, make, of, ishmael, a, great, nation, because, he, was, of, the, seed, of, abraham, however, god, told, hagar, that, her, son, would, be, living, in, conflict, with, his, relatives, when, ishmael, was, born, abraham, was, 86, years, old, when, he, was, 13, years, old, ishmael, was, circumcised, at, the, same, time, as, all, other, males, in, abraham, s, household, becoming, a, part, of, the, covenant, in, a, mass, circumcision, his, father, abram, given, the, new, name, abraham, then, 99, was, circumcised, along, with, the, others, at, the, time, of, the, covenant, god, informed, abraham, that, his, wife, sarah, would, give, birth, to, a, son, whom, he, was, instructed, to, name, isaac, god, told, abraham, that, he, would, establish, his, covenant, through, isaac, and, when, abraham, inquired, as, to, ishmael, s, role, god, answered, that, ishmael, has, been, blessed, and, that, he, will, make, him, fruitful, and, will, multiply, him, exceedingly, twelve, princes, shall, he, beget, and, i, will, make, him, a, great, nation, god, also, mentioned, that, he, will, be, a, wild, donkey, of, a, man, his, hand, will, be, over, against, everyone, and, everyone, s, hand, will, be, against, him, and, he, will, live, in, the, presence, of, his, brethren, a, year, later, ishmael, s, half, brother, isaac, was, born, to, abraham, by, his, first, wife, sarah, when, she, was, 90, years, old, after, she, had, ceased, showing, any, signs, of, fertility, on, the, day, of, feasting, during, which, abraham, celebrated, the, weaning, of, isaac, ishmael, was, mocking, or, playing, with, isaac, the, hebrew, word, me, a, eq, is, ambiguous, and, sarah, asked, abraham, to, expel, ishmael, and, his, mother, saying, get, rid, of, that, slave, woman, and, her, son, for, that, slave, woman, s, son, will, never, share, in, the, inheritance, with, my, son, isaac, her, demand, was, painful, for, abraham, who, loved, ishmael, abraham, agreed, only, after, god, told, him, that, in, isaac, your, seed, shall, be, called, and, that, god, would, make, a, nation, of, the, son, of, the, bondwoman, ishmael, since, he, was, a, descendant, of, abraham, genesis, 21, 11, 13, god, having, previously, told, abraham, i, will, establish, my, covenant, with, while, also, making, promises, concerning, the, ishmaelite, nation, genesis, 17, 18, 21, at, the, age, of, 14, ishmael, was, freed, along, with, his, mother, the, lord, s, covenant, made, clear, ishmael, was, not, to, inherit, abraham, s, house, and, that, isaac, would, be, the, seed, of, the, covenant, take, your, son, your, only, son, whom, you, love, and, go, to, the, region, of, moriah, genesis, 22, 2, 8, abraham, gave, ishmael, and, his, mother, a, supply, of, bread, and, water, and, sent, them, away, hagar, entered, in, the, wilderness, of, beer, sheba, where, the, two, soon, ran, out, of, water, and, hagar, not, wanting, to, witness, the, death, of, her, son, set, the, boy, some, distance, away, from, herself, and, wept, and, god, heard, the, voice, of, the, lad, and, sent, his, angel, to, tell, hagar, arise, lift, up, the, lad, and, hold, him, in, thine, hand, for, i, will, make, him, a, great, nation, and, god, opened, her, eyes, and, she, saw, a, well, of, water, from, which, she, drew, to, save, ishmael, s, life, and, her, own, and, god, was, with, the, lad, and, he, grew, and, dwelt, in, the, wilderness, and, became, an, archer, genesis, 21, 14, 21, after, roaming, the, wilderness, for, some, time, ishmael, and, his, mother, settled, in, the, desert, of, paran, where, he, became, an, expert, in, archery, eventually, his, mother, found, him, a, wife, from, the, land, of, egypt, they, had, twelve, sons, each, of, whom, became, a, tribal, chief, in, one, of, the, regions, from, havilah, to, shur, from, assyria, to, the, border, of, egypt, his, sons, ishmael, also, had, one, known, daughter, mahalath, or, basemath, the, third, wife, of, esau, abraham, s, corpse, was, not, buried, until, ishmael, was, sent, news, and, after, his, arrival, at, the, burial, ishmael, died, at, the, age, of, 137, historians, and, academics, in, the, field, of, source, criticism, believe, that, the, stories, of, ishmael, belong, to, the, three, strata, of, j, or, yahwist, source, the, p, or, priestly, source, and, the, e, or, elohist, source, see, documentary, hypothesis, for, example, the, narration, in, genesis, 16, is, of, j, type, and, the, narration, in, genesis, 21, 8, 21, is, of, e, type, genesis, 25, would, have, been, added, during, the, persian, period, by, the, priestly, source, who, attributed, the, known, ishmaelite, shumu, ilu, tribes, as, the, names, of, the, sons, of, ishmael, although, the, narrative, and, name, of, ishmael, himself, preceded, this, jewish, and, islamic, traditions, consider, ishmael, to, be, the, ancestor, of, arabs, in, later, jewish, texts, ishmael, is, portrayed, as, someone, who, was, inclined, towards, many, things, abraham, considered, wicked, rabbinic, sources, say, that, ishmael, prayed, to, idols, when, he, believed, to, be, alone, although, there, is, no, indication, of, this, behavior, from, the, biblical, narrative, according, to, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, hebrew, bible, isaac, rather, than, ishmael, was, the, true, heir, of, the, abrahamic, tradition, and, covenant, while, at, the, same, time, being, blessed, by, god, with, a, great, nation, in, samaritan, torah, version, ishmael, was, described, in, book, of, genesis, 16, as, a, fertile, of, man, instead, of, a, wild, ass, of, a, man, as, suggested, in, masoretic, pentateuch, which, commonly, used, as, standard, version, of, hebrew, bible, in, jewish, community, in, some, traditions, ishmael, is, said, to, have, had, two, wives, one, of, them, named, aisha, this, name, corresponds, to, the, muslim, tradition, for, the, name, of, muhammad, s, wife, this, is, understood, as, a, metaphoric, representation, of, the, muslim, world, first, arabs, and, then, turks, with, ishmael, rabbinical, commentators, in, the, midrash, genesis, rabbah, also, say, that, ishmael, s, mother, hagar, was, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, making, ishmael, the, pharaoh, s, grandson, this, could, be, why, genesis, 17, 20, refers, to, ishmael, as, the, father, of, 12, mighty, princes, according, to, genesis, 21, 21, hagar, married, ishmael, to, an, egyptian, woman, and, if, rabbinical, commentators, are, correct, that, hagar, was, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, his, marriage, to, a, woman, she, selected, could, explain, how, and, why, his, sons, became, princes, according, to, other, jewish, commentators, ishmael, s, mother, hagar, is, identified, with, keturah, the, woman, abraham, sought, out, and, married, after, sarah, s, death, it, is, suggested, that, keturah, was, hagar, s, personal, name, and, that, hagar, was, a, descriptive, label, meaning, stranger, this, interpretation, is, discussed, in, the, midrash, and, is, supported, by, rashi, gur, aryeh, keli, yakar, and, obadiah, of, bertinoro, rashi, rabbi, shlomo, itzhaki, argues, that, keturah, was, a, name, given, to, hagar, because, her, deeds, were, as, beautiful, as, incense, hebrew, ketoret, and, that, she, remained, chaste, literally, tied, her, opening, with, the, verb, tied, in, aramaic, being, k, t, r, from, the, time, she, was, separated, from, abraham, it, is, also, said, that, sarah, was, motivated, by, ishmael, s, sexually, frivolous, ways, because, of, the, reference, to, his, making, merry, gen, 21, 9, a, translation, of, the, hebrew, word, mitzachek, this, was, developed, into, a, reference, to, idolatry, sexual, immorality, or, even, murder, some, rabbinic, sources, claim, that, sarah, worried, that, ishmael, would, negatively, influence, isaac, or, that, he, would, demand, isaac, s, inheritance, on, the, grounds, of, being, the, firstborn, regarding, the, word, mitzachek, again, in, gen, 21, 9, the, jewish, study, bible, by, oxford, university, press, says, this, word, in, this, particular, context, is, associated, with, playing, is, another, pun, on, isaac, s, name, cf, 17, 17, 18, 12, 19, 14, 26, 8, ishmael, was, isaacing, or, taking, isaac, s, place, others, take, a, more, positive, view, emphasizing, hagar, s, piety, noting, that, she, was, the, one, who, had, sat, by, the, well, and, besought, him, who, is, the, life, of, the, worlds, saying, look, upon, my, misery, n, rabbinical, literature, the, name, of, ishmael, is, an, allusion, to, god, s, promise, to, hear, the, complaints, of, israel, whenever, it, suffered, at, the, hands, of, ishmael, gen, r, xlv, 11, abraham, endeavored, to, bring, up, ishmael, in, righteousness, to, train, him, in, the, laws, of, hospitality, abraham, gave, him, the, calf, to, prepare, gen, r, xlviii, 14, comp, gen, xviii, 7, but, according, to, divine, prediction, ishmael, remained, a, savage, the, ambiguous, expression, in, gen, xxi, 9, see, hagar, is, interpreted, by, some, rabbis, as, meaning, that, ishmael, had, been, idolatrous, by, others, that, he, had, turned, his, bow, against, isaac, according, to, the, interpretation, of, simeon, b, yo, ai, ishmael, mocked, those, who, maintained, that, isaac, would, be, abraham, s, chief, heir, and, said, that, as, he, ishmael, was, the, first, born, son, he, would, receive, two, thirds, of, the, inheritance, tosef, sotah, v, 12, vi, 6, pir, e, r, el, xxx, gen, r, liii, 15, upon, seeing, the, danger, to, isaac, sarah, who, had, till, then, been, attached, to, ishmael, josephus, ant, i, 12, 3,

covenant, of, grace, into, which, her, son, isaac, enters, some, pre, islamic, poetry, mentions, ishmael, his, father, abraham, and, a, sacrifice, story, such, as, the, pre, islamic, poet, umayyah, ibn, abi, as, salt, who, said, in, one, of, his, poems, of, his, first, born, of, whose, separation, he, could, not, bear, neither, could, he, see, him, surrounded, in, foes, also, some, of, the, tribes, of, central, west, arabia, called, themselves, the, people, of, abraham, and, the, offspring, of, ishmael, as, evidenced, by, a, common, opening, of, speeches, and, harangues, of,

these, references, to, ishmael, are, in, each, case, part, of, a, larger, context, in, which, other, holy, prophets, are, mentioned, in, other, chapters, of, the, quran, however, which, date, from, the, medina, period, ishmael, is, mentioned, closely, with, his, father, abraham, ishmael, stands, alongside, abraham, in, their, attempt, to, raised, the, foundation, of, the, kaaba, in, mecca, as,

with, the, hebrew, scriptures, most, modern, commentators, however, regard, the, son, s, identification, as, least, important, in, a, narrative, given, for, its, moral, lesson, the, commentaries, on, the, quran, and, the, numerous, collections, of, stories, of, the, prophets, flesh, out, the, islamic, perspective, of, ishmael, and, detail, what, they, describe, as, his, integral, part, in,

which, abraham, didn, t, reply, the, first, two, times, she, asked, she, then, changed, her, question, and, asked, did, god, command, you, to, do, this, to, which, abraham, stopped, turned, around, looked, back, and, replied, yes, she, responded, then, god, will, provide, for, us, abraham, then, continued, on, his, journey, back, to, sarah, in, the, desert, the, baby, ishmael, cried, with,
