celibacy, from, latin, caelibatus, is, the, state, of, voluntarily, being, unmarried, sexually, abstinent, or, both, usually, for, religious, reasons, it, is, often, in, association, with, the, role, of, a, religious, official, or, devotee, in, its, narrow, sense, the, term, celibacy, is, applied, only, to, those, for, whom, the, unmarried, state, is, the, result, of, a, sacred, vow, act, of, renunciation, or, religious, conviction, in, a, wider, sense, it, is, commonly, understood, to, only, mean, abstinence, from, sexual, activity, celibacy, has, existed, in, one, form, or, another, throughout, history, in, virtually, all, the, major, religions, of, the, world, and, views, on, it, have, varied, classical, hindu, culture, encouraged, asceticism, and, celibacy, in, the, later, stages, of, life, after, one, has, met, one, s, societal, obligations, jainism, on, the, other, hand, preached, complete, celibacy, even, for, young, monks, and, considered, celibacy, to, be, an, essential, behavior, to, attain, moksha, buddhism, is, similar, to, jainism, in, this, respect, there, were, however, significant, cultural, differences, in, the, various, areas, where, buddhism, spread, which, affected, the, local, attitudes, toward, celibacy, a, somewhat, similar, situation, existed, in, japan, where, the, shinto, tradition, also, opposed, celibacy, in, most, native, african, and, native, american, religious, traditions, celibacy, has, been, viewed, negatively, as, well, although, there, were, exceptions, like, periodic, celibacy, practiced, by, some, mesoamerican, warriors, the, romans, viewed, celibacy, as, an, aberration, and, legislated, fiscal, penalties, against, it, with, the, exception, of, the, vestal, virgins, who, took, a, 30, year, vow, of, chastity, in, order, to, devote, themselves, to, the, study, and, correct, observance, of, state, rituals, in, christianity, celibacy, means, the, promise, to, live, either, virginal, or, celibate, in, the, future, such, a, vow, of, celibacy, has, been, normal, for, some, centuries, for, catholic, priests, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, monks, and, nuns, in, addition, a, promise, or, vow, of, celibacy, may, be, made, in, the, anglican, communion, and, some, protestant, churches, or, communities, such, as, the, shakers, for, members, of, religious, orders, and, religious, congregations, for, hermits, consecrated, virgins, and, deaconesses, judaism, and, islam, have, denounced, celibacy, as, both, religions, emphasize, marriage, and, family, life, however, the, priests, of, the, essenes, a, jewish, sect, during, the, second, temple, period, practised, celibacy, several, hadiths, indicate, that, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, denounced, celibacy, the, english, word, celibacy, derives, from, the, latin, caelibatus, state, of, being, unmarried, from, latin, caelebs, meaning, unmarried, this, word, derives, from, two, proto, indo, european, stems, kaiwelo, alone, and, lib, h, s, living, the, words, abstinence, and, celibacy, are, often, used, interchangeably, but, are, not, necessarily, the, same, thing, sexual, abstinence, also, known, as, continence, is, abstaining, from, some, or, all, aspects, of, sexual, activity, often, for, some, limited, period, of, time, while, celibacy, may, be, defined, as, a, voluntary, religious, vow, not, to, marry, or, engage, in, sexual, activity, asexuality, is, commonly, conflated, with, celibacy, and, sexual, abstinence, but, it, is, considered, distinct, from, the, two, as, celibacy, and, sexual, abstinence, are, behavioral, and, those, who, use, those, terms, for, themselves, are, generally, motivated, by, factors, such, as, an, individual, s, personal, or, religious, beliefs, a, w, richard, sipe, while, focusing, on, the, topic, of, celibacy, in, catholicism, states, that, the, most, commonly, assumed, definition, of, celibate, is, simply, an, unmarried, or, single, person, and, celibacy, is, perceived, as, synonymous, with, sexual, abstinence, or, restraint, sipe, adds, that, even, in, the, relatively, uniform, milieu, of, catholic, priests, in, the, united, states, there, seems, to, be, simply, no, clear, operational, definition, of, celibacy, elizabeth, abbott, commented, on, the, terminology, in, her, a, history, of, celibacy, 2001, writing, that, she, drafted, a, definition, of, celibacy, that, discarded, the, rigidly, pedantic, and, unhelpful, distinctions, between, celibacy, chastity, and, virginity, the, concept, of, new, celibacy, was, introduced, by, gabrielle, brown, in, her, 1980, book, the, new, celibacy, in, a, revised, version, 1989, of, her, book, she, claims, abstinence, to, be, a, response, on, the, outside, to, what, s, going, on, and, celibacy, is, a, response, from, the, inside, according, to, her, definition, celibacy, even, short, term, celibacy, that, is, pursued, for, non, religious, reasons, is, much, more, than, not, having, sex, it, is, more, intentional, than, abstinence, and, its, goal, is, personal, growth, and, empowerment, although, brown, repeatedly, states, that, celibacy, is, a, matter, of, choice, she, clearly, suggests, that, those, who, do, not, choose, this, route, are, somehow, missing, out, this, new, perspective, on, celibacy, is, echoed, by, several, authors, including, elizabeth, abbott, wendy, keller, and, wendy, shalit, the, rule, of, celibacy, in, the, buddhist, religion, whether, mahayana, or, theravada, has, a, long, history, celibacy, was, advocated, as, an, ideal, rule, of, life, for, all, monks, and, nuns, by, gautama, buddha, except, in, japan, where, it, is, not, strictly, followed, due, to, historical, and, political, developments, following, the, meiji, restoration, in, japan, celibacy, was, an, ideal, among, buddhist, clerics, for, hundreds, of, years, but, violations, of, clerical, celibacy, were, so, common, for, so, long, that, finally, in, 1872, state, laws, made, marriage, legal, for, buddhist, clerics, subsequently, ninety, percent, of, buddhist, monks, clerics, married, an, example, is, higashifushimi, kunihide, a, prominent, buddhist, priest, of, japanese, royal, ancestry, who, was, married, and, a, father, whilst, serving, as, a, monk, for, most, of, his, lifetime, gautama, later, known, as, the, buddha, is, known, for, his, renunciation, of, his, wife, princess, yasodhar, and, son, rahula, in, order, to, pursue, an, ascetic, life, he, needed, to, renounce, aspects, of, the, impermanent, world, including, his, wife, and, son, later, on, both, his, wife, and, son, joined, the, ascetic, community, and, are, mentioned, in, the, buddhist, texts, to, have, become, enlightened, in, another, sense, a, buddhavacana, recorded, the, zen, patriarch, vimalakirti, as, being, an, advocate, of, marital, continence, instead, of, monastic, renunciation, this, sutra, became, somewhat, popular, due, to, its, brash, humour, as, well, as, its, integration, of, the, role, of, women, in, lay, and, spiritual, life, there, is, no, commandment, in, the, new, testament, that, jesus, christ, s, disciples, have, to, live, in, celibacy, however, it, is, a, general, view, that, christ, himself, lived, a, life, of, perfect, chastity, thus, voluntary, chastity, is, the, imitation, of, him, who, was, the, virgin, son, of, a, virgin, mother, one, of, his, invocations, is, king, of, virgins, and, lover, of, stainless, chastity, rex, virginum, amator, castitatis, furthermore, christ, when, his, disciples, suggest, it, is, better, not, to, marry, stated, not, everyone, can, accept, this, word, but, only, those, to, whom, it, has, been, given, for, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, been, so, from, birth, and, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, been, made, eunuchs, by, others, and, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, made, themselves, eunuchs, for, the, sake, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, let, anyone, accept, this, who, can, matthew, 19, 10, 12, nrsv, while, eunuchs, were, not, generally, celibate, over, subsequent, centuries, this, statement, has, come, to, be, interpreted, as, referring, to, celibacy, paul, the, apostle, emphasized, the, importance, of, overcoming, the, desires, of, the, flesh, and, saw, the, state, of, celibacy, being, superior, to, that, of, marriage, paul, made, parallels, between, the, relations, between, spouses, and, god, s, relationship, with, the, church, husbands, love, your, wives, even, as, christ, loved, the, church, husbands, should, love, their, wives, as, their, own, bodies, ephesians, 5, 25, 28, paul, himself, was, celibate, and, said, that, his, wish, was, that, all, of, you, were, as, i, am, 1, corinthians, 7, 7, in, fact, this, entire, chapter, endorses, celibacy, while, also, clarifying, that, marriage, is, also, acceptable, the, early, christians, lived, in, the, belief, that, the, end, of, the, world, would, soon, come, upon, them, and, saw, no, point, in, planning, new, families, and, having, children, according, to, chadwick, this, was, why, paul, encouraged, both, celibate, and, marital, lifestyles, among, the, members, of, the, corinthian, congregation, regarding, celibacy, as, the, preferable, of, the, two, in, the, counsels, of, perfection, evangelical, counsels, which, include, chastity, alongside, poverty, and, obedience, jesus, is, said, to, have, the, rule, of, the, higher, life, founded, upon, his, own, most, perfect, life, for, those, who, seek, the, highest, perfection, and, feel, called, to, follow, christ, in, this, way, i, e, through, such, exceptional, sacrifices, a, number, of, early, christian, martyrs, were, women, or, girls, who, had, given, themselves, to, christ, in, perpetual, virginity, such, as, saint, agnes, and, saint, lucy, according, to, most, christian, thought, the, first, sacred, virgin, was, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, who, was, consecrated, by, the, holy, spirit, during, the, annunciation, tradition, also, has, it, that, the, apostle, matthew, consecrated, virgins, in, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, churches, a, consecrated, virgin, is, a, woman, who, has, been, consecrated, by, the, church, to, a, life, of, perpetual, virginity, in, the, service, of, the, church, the, desert, fathers, were, christian, hermits, and, ascetics, who, had, a, major, influence, on, the, development, of, christianity, and, celibacy, paul, of, thebes, is, often, credited, with, being, the, first, hermit, or, anchorite, to, go, to, the, desert, but, it, was, anthony, the, great, who, launched, the, movement, that, became, the, desert, fathers, sometime, around, ad, 270, anthony, heard, a, sunday, sermon, stating, that, perfection, could, be, achieved, by, selling, all, of, one, s, possessions, giving, the, proceeds, to, the, poor, and, following, christ, matthew, 19, 21, he, followed, the, advice, and, made, the, further, step, of, moving, deep, into, the, desert, to, seek, complete, solitude, over, time, the, model, of, anthony, and, other, hermits, attracted, many, followers, who, lived, alone, in, the, desert, or, in, small, groups, they, chose, a, life, of, extreme, asceticism, renouncing, all, the, pleasures, of, the, senses, rich, food, baths, rest, and, anything, that, made, them, comfortable, thousands, joined, them, in, the, desert, mostly, men, but, also, a, handful, of, women, religious, seekers, also, began, going, to, the, desert, seeking, advice, and, counsel, from, the, early, desert, fathers, by, the, time, of, anthony, s, death, there, were, so, many, men, and, women, living, in, the, desert, in, celibacy, that, it, was, described, as, a, city, by, anthony, s, biographer, the, first, conciliar, document, on, clerical, celibacy, of, the, western, church, synod, of, elvira, c, 305, can, xxxiii, states, that, the, discipline, of, celibacy, is, to, refrain, from, the, use, of, marriage, i, e, refrain, from, having, carnal, contact, with, one, s, spouse, according, to, the, later, st, jerome, c, 347, 420, celibacy, is, a, moral, virtue, consisting, of, living, in, the, flesh, but, outside, the, flesh, and, so, being, not, corrupted, by, it, vivere, in, carne, praeter, carnem, celibacy, excludes, not, only, libidinous, acts, but, also, sinful, thoughts, or, desires, of, the, flesh, jerome, referred, to, marriage, prohibition, for, priests, when, he, claimed, in, against, jovinianus, that, peter, and, the, other, apostles, had, been, married, before, they, were, called, but, subsequently, gave, up, their, marital, relations, in, the, catholic, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, traditions, bishops, are, required, to, be, celibate, in, the, eastern, catholic, and, orthodox, traditions, priests, and, deacons, are, allowed, to, be, married, yet, have, to, remain, celibate, if, they, are, unmarried, at, the, time, of, ordination, in, the, early, church, higher, clerics, lived, in, marriages, augustine, taught, that, the, original, sin, of, adam, and, eve, was, either, an, act, of, foolishness, insipientia, followed, by, pride, and, disobedience, to, god, or, else, inspired, by, pride, the, first, couple, disobeyed, god, who, had, told, them, not, to, eat, of, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, gen, 2, 17, the, tree, was, a, symbol, of, the, order, of, creation, self, centeredness, made, adam, and, eve, eat, of, it, thus, failing, to, acknowledge, and, respect, the, world, as, it, was, created, by, god, with, its, hierarchy, of, beings, and, values, they, would, not, have, fallen, into, pride, and, lack, of, wisdom, if, satan, had, not, sown, into, their, senses, the, root, of, evil, radix, mali, their, nature, was, wounded, by, concupiscence, or, libido, which, affected, human, intelligence, and, will, as, well, as, affections, and, desires, including, sexual, desire, the, sin, of, adam, is, inherited, by, all, human, beings, already, in, his, pre, pelagian, writings, augustine, taught, that, original, sin, was, transmitted, by, concupiscence, which, he, regarded, as, the, passion, of, both, soul, and, body, making, humanity, a, massa, damnata, mass, of, perdition, condemned, crowd, and, much, enfeebling, though, not, destroying, the, freedom, of, the, will, in, the, early, 3rd, century, the, canons, of, the, apostolic, constitutions, decreed, that, only, lower, clerics, might, still, marry, after, their, ordination, but, marriage, of, bishops, priests, and, deacons, were, not, allowed, one, explanation, for, the, origin, of, obligatory, celibacy, is, that, it, is, based, on, the, writings, of, saint, paul, who, wrote, of, the, advantages, of, celibacy, allowed, a, man, in, serving, the, lord, celibacy, was, popularised, by, the, early, christian, theologians, like, saint, augustine, of, hippo, and, origen, another, possible, explanation, for, the, origins, of, obligatory, celibacy, revolves, around, more, practical, reason, the, need, to, avoid, claims, on, church, property, by, priests, offspring, it, remains, a, matter, of, canon, law, and, often, a, criterion, for, certain, religious, orders, especially, franciscans, that, priests, may, not, own, land, and, therefore, cannot, pass, it, on, to, legitimate, or, illegitimate, children, the, land, belongs, to, the, church, through, the, local, diocese, as, administered, by, the, local, ordinary, usually, a, bishop, who, is, often, an, ex, officio, corporation, sole, celibacy, is, viewed, differently, by, the, catholic, church, and, the, various, protestant, communities, it, includes, clerical, celibacy, celibacy, of, the, consecrated, life, and, voluntary, celibacy, the, protestant, reformation, rejected, celibate, life, and, sexual, continence, for, preachers, protestant, celibate, communities, have, emerged, especially, from, anglican, and, lutheran, backgrounds, a, few, minor, christian, sects, advocate, celibacy, as, a, better, way, of, life, these, groups, included, the, shakers, the, harmony, society, and, the, ephrata, cloister, many, evangelicals, prefer, the, term, abstinence, to, celibacy, assuming, everyone, will, marry, they, focus, their, discussion, on, refraining, from, premarital, sex, and, focusing, on, the, joys, of, a, future, marriage, but, some, evangelicals, particularly, older, singles, desire, a, positive, message, of, celibacy, that, moves, beyond, the, wait, until, marriage, message, of, abstinence, campaigns, they, seek, a, new, understanding, of, celibacy, that, is, focused, on, god, rather, than, a, future, marriage, or, a, lifelong, vow, to, the, church, there, are, also, many, pentecostal, churches, which, practice, celibate, ministry, for, instance, the, full, time, ministers, of, the, pentecostal, mission, are, celibate, and, generally, single, married, couples, who, enter, full, time, ministry, may, become, celibate, and, could, be, sent, to, different, locations, during, the, first, three, or, four, centuries, no, law, was, promulgated, prohibiting, clerical, marriage, celibacy, was, a, matter, of, choice, for, bishops, priests, and, deacons, statutes, forbidding, clergy, from, having, wives, were, written, beginning, with, the, council, of, elvira, 306, but, these, early, statutes, were, not, universal, and, were, often, defied, by, clerics, and, then, retracted, by, hierarchy, the, synod, of, gangra, 345, condemned, a, false, asceticism, whereby, worshipers, boycotted, celebrations, presided, over, by, married, clergy, the, apostolic, constitutions, c, 400, excommunicated, a, priest, or, bishop, who, left, his, wife, under, the, pretense, of, piety, mansi, 1, 51, a, famous, letter, of, synesius, of, cyrene, c, 414, is, evidence, both, for, the, respecting, of, personal, decision, in, the, matter, and, for, contemporary, appreciation, of, celibacy, for, priests, and, deacons, clerical, marriage, continued, to, be, in, vogue, the, second, lateran, council, 1139, seems, to, have, enacted, the, first, written, law, making, sacred, orders, a, direct, impediment, to, marriage, for, the, universal, church, celibacy, was, first, required, of, some, clerics, in, 1123, at, the, first, lateran, council, because, clerics, resisted, it, the, celibacy, mandate, was, restated, at, the, second, lateran, council, 1139, and, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 64, in, places, coercion, and, enslavement, of, clerical, wives, and, children, was, apparently, involved, in, the, enforcement, of, the, law, the, earliest, decree, in, which, the, children, were, declared, to, be, slaves, and, never, to, be, enfranchised, seems, to, have, been, a, canon, of, the, synod, of, pavia, in, 1018, similar, penalties, were, promulgated, against, wives, and, concubines, see, the, synod, of, melfi, 1189, can, xii, who, by, the, very, fact, of, their, unlawful, connexion, with, a, subdeacon, or, clerk, of, higher, rank, became, liable, to, be, seized, by, the, over, lord, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, twelve, apostles, are, considered, to, have, been, the, first, priests, and, bishops, of, the, church, some, say, the, call, to, be, eunuchs, for, the, sake, of, heaven, in, matthew, 19, was, a, call, to, be, sexually, continent, and, that, this, developed, into, celibacy, for, priests, as, the, successors, of, the, apostles, others, see, the, call, to, be, sexually, continent, in, matthew, 19, to, be, a, caution, for, men, who, were, too, readily, divorcing, and, remarrying, the, view, of, the, church, is, that, celibacy, is, a, reflection, of, life, in, heaven, a, source, of, detachment, from, the, material, world, which, aids, in, one, s, relationship, with, god, celibacy, is, designed, to, consecrate, themselves, with, undivided, heart, to, the, lord, and, to, the, affairs, of, the, lord, they, give, themselves, entirely, to, god, and, to, men, it, is, a, sign, of, this, new, life, to, the, service, of, which, the, church, s, minister, is, consecrated, accepted, with, a, joyous, heart, celibacy, radiantly, proclaims, the, reign, of, god, in, contrast, saint, peter, whom, the, church, considers, its, first, pope, was, married, given, that, he, had, a, mother, in, law, whom, christ, healed, matthew, 8, but, some, argue, that, peter, was, a, widower, due, to, the, fact, that, this, passage, does, not, mention, his, wife, and, that, his, mother, in, law, is, the, one, who, serves, christ, and, the, apostles, after, she, is, healed, furthermore, peter, himself, states, then, peter, spoke, up, we, have, left, everything, to, follow, you, truly, i, tell, you, jesus, replied, no, one, who, has, left, home, or, brothers, or, sisters, or, mother, or, father, or, children, or, fields, for, me, and, the, gospel, will, fail, to, receive, a, hundred, times, as, much, mark, 10, 28, 30, usually, only, celibate, men, are, ordained, as, priests, in, the, latin, church, married, clergy, who, have, converted, from, other, christian, denominations, can, be, ordained, roman, catholic, priests, without, becoming, celibate, priestly, celibacy, is, not, doctrine, of, the, church, such, as, the, belief, in, the, assumption, of, mary, but, a, matter, of, discipline, like, the, use, of, the, vernacular, local, language, in, mass, or, lenten, fasting, and, abstinence, as, such, it, can, theoretically, change, at, any, time, though, it, still, must, be, obeyed, by, catholics, until, the, change, were, to, take, place, the, eastern, catholic, churches, ordain, both, celibate, and, married, men, however, in, both, the, east, and, the, west, bishops, are, chosen, from, among, those, who, are, celibate, in, ireland, several, priests, have, fathered, children, the, two, most, prominent, being, bishop, eamonn, casey, and, michael, cleary, the, classical, heritage, flourished, throughout, the, middle, ages, in, both, the, byzantine, greek, east, and, the, latin, west, when, discerning, the, population, of, christendom, in, medieval, europe, during, the, middle, ages, will, durant, referring, to, plato, s, ideal, community, stated, on, the, oratores, clergy, the, clergy, like, plato, s, guardians, were, placed, in, authority, not, by, the, suffrages, of, the, people, but, by, their, talent, as, shown, in, ecclesiastical, studies, and, administration, by, their, disposition, to, a, life, of, meditation, and, simplicity, and, perhaps, it, should, be, added, by, the, influence, of, their, relatives, with, the, powers, of, state, and, church, in, the, latter, half, of, the, period, in, which, they, ruled, the, clergy, were, as, free, from, family, cares, as, even, plato, could, desire, and, in, some, cases, it, would, seem, they, enjoyed, no, little, of, the, reproductive, freedom, accorded, to, the, guardians, celibacy, was, part, of, the, psychological, structure, of, the, power, of, the, clergy, for, on, the, one, hand, they, were, unimpeded, by, the, narrowing, egoism, of, the, family, and, on, the, other, their, apparent, superiority, to, the, call, of, the, flesh, added, to, the, awe, in, which, lay, sinners, held, them, with, respect, to, clerical, celibacy, richard, p, o, brien, stated, in, 1995, that, in, his, opinion, greater, understanding, of, human, psychology, has, led, to, questions, regarding, the, impact, of, celibacy, on, the, human, development, of, the, clergy, the, realization, that, many, non, european, countries, view, celibacy, negatively, has, prompted, questions, concerning, the, value, of, retaining, celibacy, as, an, absolute, and, universal, requirement, for, ordained, ministry, in, the, roman, catholic, church, some, homosexual, christians, choose, to, be, celibate, following, their, denomination, s, teachings, on, homosexuality, in, 2014, the, american, association, of, christian, counselors, amended, its, code, of, ethics, to, eliminate, the, promotion, of, conversion, therapy, for, homosexuals, and, encouraged, them, to, be, celibate, instead, in, hinduism, celibacy, is, usually, associated, with, the, sadhus, holy, men, ascetics, who, withdraw, from, society, and, renounce, all, worldly, ties, celibacy, termed, brahmacharya, in, vedic, scripture, is, the, fourth, of, the, yamas, and, the, word, literally, translated, means, dedicated, to, the, divinity, of, life, the, word, is, often, used, in, yogic, practice, to, refer, to, celibacy, or, denying, pleasure, but, this, is, only, a, small, part, of, what, brahmacharya, represents, the, purpose, of, practicing, brahmacharya, is, to, keep, a, person, focused, on, the, purpose, in, life, the, things, that, instill, a, feeling, of, peace, and, contentment, it, is, also, used, to, cultivate, occult, powers, and, many, supernatural, feats, called, siddhi, in, the, religious, movement, of, brahma, kumaris, celibacy, is, also, promoted, for, peace, and, to, defeat, power, of, lust, islamic, attitudes, toward, celibacy, have, been, complex, muhammad, denounced, it, however, some, sufi, orders, embrace, it, islam, does, not, promote, celibacy, rather, it, condemns, premarital, sex, and, extramarital, sex, in, fact, according, to, islam, marriage, enables, one, to, attain, the, highest, form, of, righteousness, within, this, sacred, spiritual, bond, but, the, qur, an, does, not, state, it, as, an, obligation, the, qur, an, q57, 27, states, but, the, monasticism, which, they, who, followed, jesus, invented, for, themselves, we, did, not, prescribe, for, them, but, only, to, please, god, therewith, but, that, they, did, not,
