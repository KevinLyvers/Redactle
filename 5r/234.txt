ecumenism, k, ju, m, n, z, m, ih, kyoo, m, niz, m, alternatively, spelled, oecumenism, also, called, interdenominationalism, or, ecumenicalism, is, the, concept, and, principle, that, christians, who, belong, to, different, christian, denominations, should, work, together, to, develop, closer, relationships, among, their, churches, and, promote, christian, unity, the, adjective, ecumenical, is, thus, applied, to, any, non, denominational, initiative, that, encourages, greater, cooperation, and, union, among, christian, denominations, and, churches, the, fact, that, all, christians, belonging, to, mainstream, christian, denominations, profess, faith, in, jesus, believe, that, the, bible, is, inspired, by, god, john, 1, 1, and, receive, baptism, according, to, the, trinitarian, formula, is, seen, as, being, a, basis, for, ecumenism, and, its, goal, of, christian, unity, ecumenists, cite, john, 17, 20, 23, as, the, biblical, grounds, of, striving, for, church, unity, in, which, jesus, prays, may, all, be, one, in, order, that, the, world, may, know, and, believe, the, gospel, message, in, 1920, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, germanus, v, of, constantinople, wrote, a, letter, addressed, to, all, the, churches, of, christ, wherever, they, may, be, urging, closer, co, operation, among, separated, christians, and, suggesting, a, league, of, churches, parallel, to, the, newly, founded, league, of, nations, in, 1937, christian, leaders, from, mainstream, christian, churches, resolved, to, establish, the, world, council, of, churches, to, work, for, the, cause, of, christian, unity, it, today, includes, churches, from, most, major, traditions, of, christianity, as, full, members, including, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, old, catholic, church, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, lutheran, world, federation, the, anglican, communion, the, baptist, world, alliance, the, mennonite, churches, the, world, methodist, council, the, moravian, church, the, pentecostal, churches, and, the, world, communion, of, reformed, churches, as, well, as, almost, all, jurisdictions, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, roman, catholic, church, participates, as, an, observer, sending, delegates, to, official, gatherings, many, regional, councils, affiliated, with, the, world, council, of, churches, such, as, the, middle, east, council, of, churches, national, council, of, churches, in, australia, and, christian, churches, together, work, for, the, cause, of, christian, unity, on, the, domestic, level, with, member, denominations, including, churches, from, the, oriental, orthodox, lutheran, roman, catholic, eastern, orthodox, methodist, anglican, and, reformed, traditions, among, others, each, year, many, ecumenical, christians, observe, the, week, of, prayer, for, christian, unity, for, the, goal, of, ecumenism, which, is, coordinated, by, the, world, council, of, churches, and, adopted, by, many, of, its, member, churches, the, terms, ecumenism, and, ecumenical, come, from, the, greek, oikoumene, which, means, the, whole, inhabited, world, and, was, historically, used, with, specific, reference, to, the, roman, empire, the, ecumenical, vision, comprises, both, the, search, for, the, visible, unity, of, the, church, ephesians, 4, 3, and, the, whole, inhabited, earth, matthew, 24, 14, as, the, concern, of, all, christians, in, christianity, the, qualification, ecumenical, was, originally, and, still, is, used, in, terms, such, as, ecumenical, council, and, ecumenical, patriarch, in, the, meaning, of, pertaining, to, the, totality, of, the, larger, church, such, as, the, catholic, church, or, the, eastern, orthodox, church, rather, than, being, restricted, to, one, of, its, constituent, local, churches, or, dioceses, used, in, this, sense, the, term, carries, no, connotation, of, re, uniting, the, historically, separated, christian, denominations, but, presumes, a, unity, of, local, congregations, in, a, worldwide, communion, the, term, ecumenism, as, it, is, now, commonly, used, refers, to, interdenominational, cooperation, between, different, christian, churches, these, initiatives, can, range, from, local, churches, of, different, denominations, operating, a, soup, kitchen, for, the, poor, hosting, an, ecumenical, bible, study, with, participants, from, different, christian, traditions, inviting, all, baptized, christians, to, partake, in, a, lovefeast, when, churches, celebrate, them, to, holding, an, ecumenical, stations, of, the, cross, service, on, fridays, during, the, christian, liturgical, season, of, lent, with, the, service, being, held, at, a, different, local, church, each, friday, e, g, catholic, lutheran, moravian, anglican, reformed, and, methodist, the, ultimate, goal, of, ecumenism, is, the, recognition, of, sacramental, validity, eucharistic, sharing, and, the, reaching, of, full, communion, between, different, christian, denominations, there, are, a, variety, of, different, expectations, of, what, that, christian, unity, looks, like, how, it, is, brought, about, what, ecumenical, methods, ought, to, be, engaged, and, what, both, short, and, long, term, objectives, of, the, ecumenical, movement, should, be, baptism, according, to, the, trinitarian, formula, which, is, done, in, most, mainstream, christian, denominations, is, seen, as, being, the, grounds, for, christian, ecumenism, the, concept, of, unity, amongst, christians, with, respect, to, ecumenism, a, w, tozer, maintained, that, unity, in, christ, is, not, something, to, be, achieved, it, is, something, to, be, recognized, ecumenists, cite, john, 17, 20, 23, as, the, biblical, basis, of, striving, for, church, unity, in, which, jesus, prays, that, christians, may, all, be, one, in, order, that, the, world, may, know, and, believe, the, gospel, message, as, such, ecumenism, has, a, strong, implication, for, the, church, s, mission, of, evangelism, which, is, referenced, in, john, 13, 35, by, this, all, men, will, know, that, you, are, my, disciples, if, you, love, one, another, additionally, jesus, emphasized, that, the, ties, of, christians, to, one, another, are, much, greater, than, those, to, blood, relatives, historically, the, term, ecumenism, was, originally, used, in, the, context, of, the, larger, ecumenical, councils, organised, with, the, support, of, the, roman, emperor, the, aim, of, these, councils, was, to, clarify, matters, of, christian, theology, and, doctrine, leading, to, the, meaning, of, unity, behind, the, term, ecumenical, the, ecumenical, councils, brought, together, bishops, from, across, the, roman, empire, with, a, total, of, seven, ecumenical, councils, accepted, to, have, been, held, by, both, the, eastern, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, before, the, great, schism, dividing, the, two, churches, the, first, four, ecumenical, councils, are, recognized, by, the, lutheran, churches, anglican, communion, and, reformed, churches, though, they, are, considered, subordinate, to, scripture, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, acknowledges, the, first, two, ecumenical, councils, while, oriental, orthodox, churches, accept, the, first, three, ecumenical, councils, christianity, has, not, been, a, monolithic, faith, since, the, first, century, also, known, as, the, apostolic, age, and, in, the, present, day, a, number, of, widely, varied, christian, groups, exist, both, within, and, without, mainstream, christianity, despite, the, division, between, these, groups, a, number, of, commonalities, exist, throughout, their, traditions, understanding, of, theology, governing, church, systems, doctrine, and, language, as, such, many, of, these, groups, are, visibly, divided, into, different, communions, or, denominations, groupings, of, christians, and, their, churches, in, full, communion, with, one, another, but, to, some, degree, set, apart, from, other, christians, the, world, council, of, churches, counts, 348, member, churches, representing, more, than, half, a, billion, members, of, the, major, christian, traditions, this, with, the, catholic, church, s, 1, 25, billion, christians, indicates, that, 349, churches, denominations, already, account, for, nearly, 80, of, the, world, s, christian, population, one, problem, with, the, larger, numbers, is, that, single, denominations, can, be, counted, multiple, times, for, example, the, catholic, church, is, a, single, church, or, communion, comprising, 24, distinct, self, governing, particular, churches, in, full, communion, with, the, bishop, of, rome, the, largest, being, the, latin, church, commonly, called, roman, catholic, further, the, catholic, church, s, presence, in, each, country, is, counted, as, a, different, denomination, though, this, is, in, no, way, an, ecclesiologically, accurate, definition, this, can, result, in, the, one, catholic, church, being, counted, as, 242, distinct, denominations, as, in, the, world, christian, encyclopedia, additionally, single, nondenominational, congregations, or, megachurches, without, denominational, affiliation, are, effectively, counted, each, as, its, own, denomination, resulting, in, cases, where, entire, denominations, may, account, for, only, a, handful, of, people, other, denominations, may, be, very, small, remnants, of, once, larger, churches, the, united, society, of, believers, in, christ, s, second, appearing, shakers, have, only, two, full, members, for, example, yet, are, a, distinct, denomination, most, current, divisions, are, the, result, of, historical, schisms, a, break, in, the, full, communion, between, previously, united, churches, bishops, or, communities, some, historical, schisms, proved, temporary, and, were, eventually, healed, others, have, hardened, into, the, denominations, of, today, however, individual, denominations, are, counted, it, is, generally, acknowledged, that, they, fall, into, the, following, major, families, of, churches, though, certain, parts, of, some, christian, denominations, such, as, quakerism, may, fall, into, the, mainline, category, though, the, majority, are, evangelical, quakers, in, the, united, states, the, historic, racial, ethnic, churches, are, sometimes, counted, as, a, distinct, family, of, churches, though, they, may, otherwise, fit, into, any, one, of, the, previous, categories, some, of, these, families, are, in, themselves, a, single, communion, such, as, the, catholic, church, other, families, are, a, very, general, movement, with, no, universal, governing, authority, protestantism, for, example, includes, such, diverse, groups, as, adventists, anabaptists, baptists, congregationalists, evangelicals, hussites, lutherans, messianic, jews, methodists, inclusive, of, the, holiness, movement, moravians, pentecostals, presbyterians, reformed, and, waldensians, many, of, these, have, as, a, result, of, ecumenical, dialogue, established, full, or, partial, communion, agreements, the, oldest, lasting, schism, in, christianity, resulted, from, fifth, century, disagreements, on, christology, heightened, by, philosophical, linguistic, cultural, and, political, differences, the, first, significant, lasting, split, in, historic, christianity, the, so, called, nestorian, schism, came, from, the, church, of, the, east, consisting, largely, of, eastern, syriac, churches, outside, the, roman, empire, who, left, full, communion, after, 431, in, response, to, misunderstandings, and, personality, conflicts, at, the, council, of, ephesus, after, fifteen, centuries, of, estrangement, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, and, the, catholic, church, entered, into, an, ecumenical, dialogue, in, the, 1980s, resulting, in, agreement, on, the, very, issue, that, split, them, asunder, in, the, 1994, common, christological, declaration, which, identifies, the, origin, of, the, schism, as, largely, linguistic, due, to, problems, of, translating, very, delicate, and, precise, terminology, from, latin, to, aramaic, and, vice, versa, as, part, of, the, then, ongoing, christological, controversy, following, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, 451, the, next, large, split, came, with, the, syriac, and, coptic, churches, dividing, themselves, the, churches, dissented, from, chalcedon, becoming, today, s, oriental, orthodox, churches, these, also, include, the, armenian, apostolic, church, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, and, the, malankara, orthodox, syrian, church, in, india, in, modern, times, there, have, also, been, moves, towards, healing, this, division, with, common, christological, statements, being, made, between, pope, john, paul, ii, and, syriac, patriarch, ignatius, zakka, i, iwas, as, well, as, between, representatives, of, both, oriental, orthodoxy, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, although, the, christian, world, as, a, whole, did, not, experience, any, major, church, divisions, for, centuries, afterward, the, eastern, predominantly, greek, speaking, and, western, predominantly, latin, speaking, cultural, divisions, drifted, toward, isolation, culminating, in, the, mutual, excommunication, of, patriarch, of, constantinople, michael, i, cerularius, and, the, legate, of, then, deceased, pope, of, rome, leo, ix, in, 1054, in, what, is, known, as, the, great, schism, the, canonical, separation, was, sealed, by, the, latin, sacking, of, constantinople, 1204, during, the, fourth, crusade, and, through, the, poor, reception, of, the, council, of, florence, 1449, among, the, orthodox, eastern, churches, the, political, and, theological, reasons, for, the, schism, are, complex, aside, from, the, natural, rivalry, between, the, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, and, the, franco, latin, holy, roman, empire, one, major, controversy, was, the, inclusion, and, acceptance, in, the, west, in, general, and, in, the, diocese, of, rome, in, particular, of, the, filioque, clause, and, the, son, into, the, nicene, constantinopolitan, creed, which, the, east, viewed, as, a, violation, of, ecclesiastical, procedure, at, best, an, abuse, of, papal, authority, as, only, an, ecumenical, council, could, amend, what, had, been, defined, by, a, previous, council, and, a, heresy, at, worst, inasfar, as, the, filioque, implies, that, the, essential, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, is, derived, not, from, the, father, alone, as, arche, singular, head, and, source, but, from, the, perichoretic, union, between, the, father, and, the, son, that, the, hypostasis, or, persona, of, the, spirit, either, is, or, is, produced, by, the, mutual, pre, eternal, love, between, god, and, his, word, is, an, explanation, which, eastern, christian, detractors, have, alleged, is, rooted, in, the, medieval, augustinian, appropriation, of, plotinian, neoplatonism, see, augustine, of, hippo, de, trinitate, both, west, and, east, agreed, that, the, patriarch, of, rome, was, owed, a, primacy, of, honour, by, the, other, patriarchs, those, of, alexandria, antioch, constantinople, and, jerusalem, but, the, west, also, contended, that, this, primacy, extended, to, jurisdiction, a, position, rejected, by, the, eastern, patriarchs, various, attempts, at, dialogue, between, the, two, groups, would, occur, but, it, was, only, in, the, 1960s, under, pope, paul, vi, and, patriarch, athenagoras, that, significant, steps, began, to, be, made, to, mend, the, relationship, between, the, two, in, 1965, the, excommunications, were, committed, to, oblivion, the, resulting, division, remains, however, providing, the, catholic, church, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, both, of, which, are, globally, distributed, bodies, and, no, longer, restricted, geographically, or, culturally, to, the, west, or, east, respectively, there, exist, both, eastern, rite, roman, catholicism, and, western, rite, orthodoxy, for, example, there, is, an, ongoing, and, fruitful, catholic, orthodox, dialogue, in, western, christianity, there, were, a, handful, of, geographically, isolated, movements, that, preceded, in, the, spirit, of, the, protestant, reformation, the, cathars, were, a, very, strong, movement, in, medieval, southwestern, france, but, did, not, survive, into, modern, times, largely, as, a, result, of, the, albigensian, crusade, in, northern, italy, and, southeastern, france, peter, waldo, founded, the, waldensians, in, the, 12th, century, which, remains, the, largest, non, catholic, church, in, italy, and, is, in, full, communion, with, the, italian, methodist, church, in, bohemia, a, movement, in, the, early, 15th, century, by, jan, hus, called, the, hussites, called, for, reform, of, catholic, teaching, and, still, exists, to, this, day, known, as, the, moravian, church, though, generally, counted, among, protestant, churches, groups, such, as, the, waldensians, and, moravians, pre, exist, protestantism, proper, the, protestant, reformation, began, symbolically, with, the, posting, of, martin, luther, s, ninety, five, theses, in, saxony, on, october, 31, 1517, written, as, a, set, of, grievances, to, reform, the, western, church, luther, s, writings, combined, with, the, work, of, swiss, theologian, huldrych, zwingli, and, french, theologian, and, politician, john, calvin, sought, to, reform, existing, problems, in, doctrine, and, practice, due, to, the, reactions, of, ecclesiastical, office, holders, at, the, time, of, the, reformers, the, catholic, church, separated, from, them, instigating, a, rift, in, western, christianity, this, schism, created, the, mainline, protestant, churches, including, especially, the, lutheran, and, reformed, traditions, in, england, henry, viii, of, england, declared, himself, to, be, supreme, head, of, the, church, of, england, with, the, act, of, supremacy, in, 1531, repressing, both, lutheran, reformers, and, those, loyal, to, the, pope, thomas, cranmer, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, introduced, the, english, reformation, in, a, form, compromising, between, the, calvinists, and, lutherans, this, schism, created, today, s, anglican, communion, the, radical, reformation, also, mid, sixteenth, century, moved, beyond, the, magisterial, reformation, emphasizing, the, invisible, spiritual, reality, of, the, church, apart, from, any, visible, ecclesial, manifestation, a, significant, group, of, radical, reformers, were, the, anabaptists, people, such, as, menno, simons, and, jakob, ammann, whose, movements, resulted, in, today, s, communities, of, mennonites, amish, hutterites, and, brethren, churches, and, to, some, extent, the, bruderhof, communities, further, reform, movements, within, anglicanism, during, the, 16th, through, 18th, centuries, with, influence, from, the, radical, reformation, produced, the, puritans, and, separatists, creating, today, s, baptists, congregationalists, quakers, and, eventually, unitarian, universalism, the, methodist, churches, which, uphold, wesleyan, arminian, theology, grew, out, of, a, revival, within, anglicanism, especially, in, england, and, the, american, colonies, under, the, leadership, of, the, brothers, john, wesley, and, charles, wesley, both, priests, in, the, church, of, england, this, movement, also, produced, the, holiness, movement, churches, the, old, catholic, church, split, from, the, catholic, church, in, the, 1870s, because, of, the, promulgation, of, the, dogma, of, papal, infallibility, as, promoted, by, the, first, vatican, council, of, 1869, 1870, the, term, old, catholic, was, first, used, in, 1853, to, describe, the, members, of, the, see, of, utrecht, who, were, not, under, papal, authority, the, old, catholic, movement, grew, in, america, but, has, not, maintained, ties, with, utrecht, although, talks, are, under, way, between, some, independent, old, catholic, bishops, and, utrecht, the, evangelical, movement, takes, form, as, the, result, of, spiritual, renewal, efforts, in, the, anglophone, world, in, the, 18th, century, according, to, religion, scholar, social, activist, and, politician, randall, balmer, evangelicalism, resulted, from, the, confluence, of, pietism, presbyterianism, and, the, vestiges, of, puritanism, evangelicalism, picked, up, the, peculiar, characteristics, from, each, strain, warmhearted, spirituality, from, the, pietists, for, instance, doctrinal, precisionism, from, the, presbyterians, and, individualistic, introspection, from, the, puritans, historian, mark, noll, adds, to, this, list, high, church, anglicanism, which, contributed, to, evangelicalism, a, legacy, of, rigorous, spirituality, and, innovative, organization, pentecostalism, is, likewise, born, out, of, this, context, and, traditionally, traces, its, origins, to, what, it, describes, as, an, outpouring, of, the, holy, spirit, on, 1, january, 1901, in, topeka, kansas, at, the, bethel, bible, college, subsequent, charismatic, revivals, in, wales, in, 1904, and, the, azusa, street, revival, in, 1906, are, held, as, the, beginnings, of, the, pentecostal, movement, these, started, just, a, few, hours, after, pope, leo, xiii, led, a, prayer, veni, spiritus, sanctus, during, an, urbi, et, orbi, message, consecrating, the, 20th, century, to, the, holy, spirit, and, through, this, prayer, to, the, reunion, of, christianity, for, some, protestants, spiritual, unity, and, often, unity, on, the, church, s, teachings, on, central, issues, suffices, according, to, lutheran, theologian, edmund, schlink, most, important, in, christian, ecumenism, is, that, people, focus, primarily, on, christ, not, on, separate, church, organizations, in, schlink, s, book, kumenische, dogmatik, 1983, he, says, christians, who, see, the, risen, christ, at, work, in, the, lives, of, various, christians, or, in, diverse, churches, realize, that, the, unity, of, christ, s, church, has, never, been, lost, but, has, instead, been, distorted, and, obscured, by, different, historical, experiences, and, by, spiritual, myopia, both, are, overcome, in, renewed, faith, in, christ, included, in, that, is, responding, to, his, admonition, john, 17, philippians, 2, to, be, one, in, him, and, love, one, another, as, a, witness, to, the, world, the, result, of, mutual, recognition, would, be, a, discernible, worldwide, fellowship, organized, in, a, historically, new, way, for, a, significant, part, of, the, christian, world, one, of, the, highest, goals, to, be, sought, is, the, reconciliation, of, the, various, denominations, by, overcoming, the, historical, divisions, within, christianity, even, where, there, is, broad, agreement, upon, this, goal, approaches, to, ecumenism, vary, generally, protestants, see, fulfillment, of, the, goal, of, ecumenism, as, consisting, in, general, agreements, on, teachings, about, central, issues, of, faith, with, mutual, pastoral, accountability, between, the, diverse, churches, regarding, the, teachings, of, salvation, for, catholics, and, orthodox, on, the, other, hand, the, true, unity, of, christendom, is, treated, in, accordance, with, their, more, sacramental, understanding, of, the, body, of, christ, this, ecclesiastical, matter, for, them, is, closely, linked, to, key, theological, issues, e, g, regarding, the, eucharist, and, the, historical, episcopate, and, requires, full, dogmatic, assent, to, the, pastoral, authority, of, the, church, for, full, communion, to, be, considered, viable, and, valid, thus, there, are, different, answers, even, to, the, question, of, the, church, which, finally, is, the, goal, of, the, ecumenist, movement, itself, however, the, desire, of, unity, is, expressed, by, many, denominations, generally, that, all, who, profess, faith, in, christ, in, sincerity, would, be, more, fully, cooperative, and, supportive, of, one, another, for, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, the, process, of, approaching, one, another, can, be, described, as, formally, split, in, two, successive, stages, the, dialogue, of, love, and, the, dialogue, of, truth, examples, of, acts, belonging, to, the, former, include, the, mutual, revocation, in, 1965, of, the, anathemas, of, 1054, returning, the, relics, of, sabbas, the, sanctified, a, common, saint, to, mar, saba, in, the, same, year, and, the, first, visit, of, a, pope, to, an, orthodox, country, in, a, millennium, pope, john, paul, ii, accepting, the, invitation, of, the, patriarch, of, the, romanian, orthodox, church, teoctist, in, 1999, among, others, christian, ecumenism, can, be, described, in, terms, of, the, three, largest, divisions, of, christianity, roman, catholic, eastern, orthodox, and, protestant, while, this, underemphasizes, the, complexity, of, these, divisions, it, is, a, useful, model, the, catholic, church, has, always, considered, it, a, duty, of, the, highest, rank, to, seek, full, unity, with, estranged, communions, of, fellow, christians, and, at, the, same, time, to, reject, what, it, sees, as, a, false, union, that, would, mean, being, unfaithful, to, or, glossing, over, the, teaching, of, sacred, scripture, and, tradition, before, the, second, vatican, council, the, main, stress, was, laid, on, this, second, aspect, as, exemplified, in, canon, 1258, of, the, 1917, code, of, canon, law, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, has, no, corresponding, canon, it, absolutely, forbids, catholic, priests, to, concelebrate, the, eucharist, with, members, of, communities, which, are, not, in, full, communion, canon, 908, but, allows, in, certain, circumstances, and, under, certain, conditions, other, sharing, in, the, sacraments, the, directory, for, the, application, of, principles, and, norms, on, ecumenism, 102, states, christians, may, be, encouraged, to, share, in, spiritual, activities, and, resources, i, e, to, share, that, spiritual, heritage, they, have, in, common, in, a, manner, and, to, a, degree, appropriate, to, their, present, divided, state, pope, john, xxiii, who, convoked, the, council, that, brought, this, change, of, emphasis, about, said, that, the, council, s, aim, was, to, seek, renewal, of, the, church, itself, which, would, serve, for, those, separated, from, the, see, of, rome, as, a, gentle, invitation, to, seek, and, find, that, unity, for, which, jesus, christ, prayed, so, ardently, to, his, heavenly, father, some, elements, of, the, catholic, perspective, on, ecumenism, are, illustrated, in, the, following, quotations, from, the, council, s, decree, on, ecumenism, unitatis, redintegratio, of, 21, november, 1964, and, pope, john, paul, ii, s, encyclical, ut, unum, sint, of, 25, may, 1995, every, renewal, of, the, church, is, essentially, grounded, in, an, increase, of, fidelity, to, her, own, calling, undoubtedly, this, is, the, basis, of, the, movement, toward, unity, there, can, be, no, ecumenism, worthy, of, the, name, without, a, change, of, heart, for, it, is, from, renewal, of, the, inner, life, of, our, minds, from, self, denial, and, an, unstinted, love, that, desires, of, unity, take, their, rise, and, develop, in, a, mature, way, we, should, therefore, pray, to, the, holy, spirit, for, the, grace, to, be, genuinely, self, denying, humble, gentle, in, the, service, of, others, and, to, have, an, attitude, of, brotherly, generosity, towards, them, the, words, of, st, john, hold, good, about, sins, against, unity, if, we, say, we, have, not, sinned, we, make, him, a, liar, and, his, word, is, not, in, us, so, we, humbly, beg, pardon, of, god, and, of, our, separated, brethren, just, as, we, forgive, them, that, trespass, against, us, christians, cannot, underestimate, the, burden, of, long, standing, misgivings, inherited, from, the, past, and, of, mutual, misunderstandings, and, prejudices, complacency, indifference, and, insufficient, knowledge, of, one, another, often, make, this, situation, worse, consequently, the, commitment, to, ecumenism, must, be, based, upon, the, conversion, of, hearts, and, upon, prayer, which, will, also, lead, to, the, necessary, purification, of, past, memories, with, the, grace, of, the, holy, spirit, the, lord, s, disciples, inspired, by, love, by, the, power, of, the, truth, and, by, a, sincere, desire, for, mutual, forgiveness, and, reconciliation, are, called, to, re, examine, together, their, painful, past, and, the, hurt, which, that, past, regrettably, continues, to, provoke, even, today, in, ecumenical, dialogue, catholic, theologians, standing, fast, by, the, teaching, of, the, church, and, investigating, the, divine, mysteries, with, the, separated, brethren, must, proceed, with, love, for, the, truth, with, charity, and, with, humility, when, comparing, doctrines, with, one, another, they, should, remember, that, in, catholic, doctrine, there, exists, a, hierarchy, of, truths, since, they, vary, in, their, relation, to, the, fundamental, christian, faith, thus, the, way, will, be, opened, by, which, through, fraternal, rivalry, all, will, be, stirred, to, a, deeper, understanding, and, a, clearer, presentation, of, the, unfathomable, riches, of, christ, the, unity, willed, by, god, can, be, attained, only, by, the, adherence, of, all, to, the, content, of, revealed, faith, in, its, entirety, in, matters, of, faith, compromise, is, in, contradiction, with, god, who, is, truth, in, the, body, of, christ, the, way, and, the, truth, and, the, life, jn, 14, 6, who, could, consider, legitimate, a, reconciliation, brought, about, at, the, expense, of, the, truth, even, so, doctrine, needs, to, be, presented, in, a, way, that, makes, it, understandable, to, those, for, whom, god, himself, intends, it, when, the, obstacles, to, perfect, ecclesiastical, communion, have, been, gradually, overcome, all, christians, will, at, last, in, a, common, celebration, of, the, eucharist, be, gathered, into, the, one, and, only, church, in, that, unity, which, christ, bestowed, on, his, church, from, the, beginning, we, believe, that, this, unity, subsists, in, the, catholic, church, as, something, she, can, never, lose, and, we, hope, that, it, will, continue, to, increase, until, the, end, of, time, while, some, eastern, orthodox, churches, commonly, rebaptize, converts, from, the, catholic, church, thereby, refusing, to, recognize, the, baptism, that, the, converts, have, previously, received, the, catholic, church, has, always, accepted, the, validity, of, all, the, sacraments, administered, by, the, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, catholic, church, likewise, has, very, seldom, applied, the, terms, heterodox, or, heretic, to, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, or, its, members, although, there, are, clear, differences, in, doctrine, notably, about, the, authority, of, the, pope, purgatory, and, the, filioque, clause, more, often, the, term, separated, or, schismatic, has, been, applied, to, the, state, of, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, the, oriental, orthodox, and, eastern, orthodox, churches, are, two, distinct, bodies, of, local, churches, the, churches, within, each, body, share, full, communion, although, there, is, not, official, communion, between, the, two, bodies, both, consider, themselves, to, be, the, original, church, from, which, the, west, was, divided, in, the, 5th, and, 11th, centuries, respectively, after, the, 3rd, and, 7th, ecumenical, councils, many, theologians, of, the, eastern, and, oriental, orthodoxies, engage, in, theological, dialogue, with, each, other, and, with, some, of, the, western, churches, though, short, of, full, communion, the, eastern, orthodox, have, participated, in, the, ecumenical, movement, with, students, active, in, the, world, student, christian, federation, since, the, late, 19th, century, most, eastern, orthodox, and, all, oriental, orthodox, churches, are, members, of, the, world, council, of, churches, kallistos, of, diokleia, a, bishop, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, stated, that, ecumenism, is, important, for, orthodoxy, it, has, helped, to, force, the, various, orthodox, churches, out, of, their, comparative, isolation, making, them, meet, one, another, and, enter, into, a, living, contact, with, non, orthodox, christians, historically, the, relationship, between, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, anglican, communion, has, been, congenial, with, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, in, 1922, recognising, anglican, orders, as, valid, he, wrote, that, the, orthodox, theologians, who, have, scientifically, examined, the, question, have, almost, unanimously, come, to, the, same, conclusions, and, have, declared, themselves, as, accepting, the, validity, of, anglican, orders, moreover, some, eastern, orthodox, bishops, have, assisted, in, the, ordination, of, anglican, bishops, for, example, in, 1870, the, most, reverend, alexander, lycurgus, the, greek, orthodox, archbishop, of, syra, and, tinos, was, one, of, the, bishops, who, consecrated, henry, mackenzie, as, the, suffragan, bishop, of, nottingham, from, 1910, to, 1911, the, era, before, world, war, i, raphael, of, brooklyn, an, eastern, orthodox, bishop, sanctioned, an, interchange, of, ministrations, with, the, episcopalians, in, places, where, members, of, one, or, the, other, communion, are, without, clergy, of, their, own, bishop, raphael, stated, that, in, places, where, there, is, no, resident, orthodox, priest, an, anglican, episcopalian, priest, could, administer, marriage, holy, baptism, and, the, blessed, sacrament, to, an, orthodox, layperson, in, 1912, however, bishop, raphael, ended, the, intercommunion, after, becoming, uncomfortable, with, the, fact, that, the, anglican, communion, contained, different, churchmanships, within, her, e, g, high, church, evangelical, etc, however, after, world, war, i, the, fellowship, of, saint, alban, and, saint, sergius, was, organized, in, 1927, which, much, like, the, anglican, and, eastern, churches, association, worked, on, ecumenism, between, the, two, churches, both, of, these, organisations, continue, their, task, today, in, accordance, with, the, soviet, anti, religious, legislation, under, the, state, atheism, of, the, soviet, union, several, russian, orthodox, churches, and, seminaries, were, closed, with, ecumenical, aid, from, methodists, in, the, united, states, two, russian, orthodox, seminaries, were, reopened, and, hierarchs, of, the, orthodox, church, thankfully, made, the, following, statement, the, services, rendered, by, the, american, methodists, and, other, christian, friends, will, go, down, in, history, of, the, orthodox, church, as, one, of, its, brightest, pages, in, that, dark, and, trying, time, of, the, church, our, church, will, never, forget, the, samaritan, service, which, your, whole, church, unselfishly, rendered, us, may, this, be, the, beginning, of, closer, friendship, for, our, churches, and, nations, protestants, are, involved, in, a, variety, of, ecumenical, groups, working, in, some, cases, toward, organic, denominational, unity, and, in, other, cases, for, cooperative, purposes, alone, because, of, the, wide, spectrum, of, protestant, denominations, and, perspectives, full, cooperation, has, been, difficult, at, times, edmund, schlink, s, kumenische, dogmatik, 1983, 1997, proposes, a, way, through, these,

keep, it, alive, and, acting, as, a, trustee, for, the, inner, coherence, of, the, movement, some, scholars, such, as, antoaneta, sab, u, think, that, the, features, that, ecumenism, may, display, today, could, testify, against, the, idea, of, a, diminished, interest, in, ecumenical, matters, and, rather, for, the, fact, that, essential, concepts, of, ecumenism, have, already, become, integrative, parts, of, contemporary, theologies, the, mutual, anathemas, excommunications, of, 1054, marking, the, great, schism, between, western, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, branches, of, christianity, a, process, spanning, several, centuries, were, revoked, in, 1965, by, pope, paul, vi, and, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, constantinople, the, catholic, church, does, not, regard, orthodox, christians, as, excommunicated, since, they, personally, have, no, responsibility, for, the, separation, of, their, churches, in, fact, catholic, rules, admit, the, orthodox, to, communion, and, the, other, sacraments, in, situations, where, the, individuals, are, in, danger, of, death, or, no, orthodox, churches, exist, to, serve, the, needs, of, their, faithful, however, orthodox, churches, still, generally, regard, roman, catholics, as, excluded, from, the, sacraments, and, some, may, even, not, regard, catholic, sacraments, such, as, baptism, and, ordination, as, valid, in, november, 2006, pope, benedict, xvi, traveled, to, istanbul, at, the, invitation, of, patriarch, bartholomew, i, of, constantinople, and, participated, in, the, feast, day, services, of, st, andrew, the, first, apostle, the, patron, saint, of, the, church, of, constantinople, the, ecumenical, patriarch, and, pope, benedict, had, another, historic, meeting, in, ravenna, italy, in, 2007, the, declaration, of, ravenna, marked, a, significant, rapprochement, between, the, roman, catholic, and, orthodox, positions, the, declaration, recognized, the, bishop, of, rome, as, the, protos, or, first, among, equals, of, the, patriarchs, this, acceptance, and, the, entire, agreement, was, hotly, contested, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, the, signing, of, the, declaration, highlighted, the, pre, existing, tensions, between, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, and, the, moscow, patriarchate, besides, their, theological, concerns, the, russian, orthodox, have, continuing, concerns, over, the, question, of, the, eastern, catholic, churches, that, operate, in, what, they, regard, as, orthodox, territory, this, question, has, been, exacerbated, by, disputes, over, churches, and, other, property, that, the, communist, authorities, once, assigned, to, the, orthodox, church, but, whose, restoration, these, churches, have, obtained, from, the, present, authorities, a, major, obstacle, to, improved, relations, between, the, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, has, been, the, insertion, of, the, latin, term, filioque, into, the, niceno, constantinopolitan, creed, in, the, 8th, and, 11th, centuries, this, obstacle, has, now, been, effectively, resolved, the, catholic, church, now, recognizes, that, the, creed, as, confessed, at, the, first, council, of, constantinople, did, not, add, and, the, son, when, it, spoke, of, the, holy, spirit, as, proceeding, from, the, father, when, quoting, the, niceno, constantinopolitan, creed, as, in, the, 6, august, 2000, document, dominus, iesus, it, does, not, include, filioque, it, views, as, complementary, the, eastern, tradition, expression, who, proceeds, from, the, father, profession, of, which, it, sees, as, affirming, that, he, comes, from, the, father, through, the, son, and, the, western, tradition, expression, who, proceeds, from, the, father, and, the, son, with, the, eastern, tradition, expressing, firstly, the, father, s, character, as, first, origin, of, the, spirit, and, the, western, tradition, giving, expression, firstly, to, the, consubstantial, communion, between, father, and, son, and, it, believes, that, provided, this, legitimate, complementarity, does, not, become, rigid, it, does, not, affect, the, identity, of, faith, in, the, reality, of, the, same, mystery, confessed, continuing, dialogues, at, both, international, and, national, level, continues, between, the, roman, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, a, particularly, close, relationship, has, grown, up, between, pope, francis, and, ecumenical, patriarch, bartholomew, both, church, leaders, have, in, particular, emphasized, their, common, concern, for, refugees, and, persecuted, christians, in, the, middle, east, the, 2016, pan, orthodox, council, that, was, held, in, crete, aroused, great, expectations, for, advances, in, church, unity, however, not, all, orthodox, churches, participated, and, as, a, result, the, russian, patriarch, refused, to, recognize, the, council, as, a, truly, ecumenical, gathering, a, major, milestone, in, the, growing, rapprochement, between, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, was, the, 12, february, 2016, meeting, held, in, havana, cuba, between, patriarch, kirill, and, pope, francis, the, two, church, leaders, issued, a, joint, declaration, of, pope, francis, and, patriarch, kirill, at, the, conclusion, of, their, discussions, the, decision, by, the, u, s, episcopal, church, to, ordain, gene, robinson, an, openly, gay, non, celibate, priest, who, advocates, same, sex, blessings, as, bishop, led, the, russian, orthodox, church, to, suspend, its, cooperation, with, the, episcopal, church, likewise, when, the, church, of, sweden, decided, to, bless, same, sex, marriages, the, russian, patriarchate, severed, all, relations, with, the, church, noting, that, approving, the, shameful, practice, of, same, sex, marriages, is, a, serious, blow, to, the, entire, system, of, european, spiritual, and, moral, values, influenced, by, christianity, bishop, hilarion, alfeyev, commented, that, the, inter, christian, community, is, bursting, at, the, seams, he, sees, the, great, dividing, line, or, abyss, not, so, much, between, old, churches, and, church, families, as, between, traditionalists, and, liberals, the, latter, now, dominating, protestantism, and, predicted, that, other, northern, protestant, churches, will, follow, suit, and, this, means, that, the, ecumenical, ship, will, sink, for, with, the, liberalism, that, is, materializing, in, european, protestant, churches, there, is, no, longer, anything, to, talk, about, organizations, such, as, the, world, council, of, churches, the, national, council, of, churches, usa, churches, uniting, in, christ, pentecostal, charismatic, peace, fellowship, and, christian, churches, together, continue, to, encourage, ecumenical, cooperation, among, protestants, eastern, orthodox, and, at, times, roman, catholics, there, are, universities, such, as, the, university, of, bonn, in, germany, that, offer, degree, courses, in, ecumenical, studies, in, which, theologians, of, various, denominations, teach, their, respective, traditions, and, at, the, same, time, seek, for, common, ground, between, these, traditions, the, global, christian, forum, gcf, was, founded, in, 1998, following, the, proposal, of, the, then, general, secretary, of, the, wcc, rev, konrad, raiser, that, a, new, independent, space, should, be, created, where, participants, could, meet, on, an, equal, basis, to, foster, mutual, respect, and, to, explore, and, address, together, common, concerns, through, a, postmodern, approach, influenced, by, the, ecumenical, movement, the, scandal, of, separation, and, local, developments, a, number, of, united, and, uniting, churches, have, formed, there, are, also, a, range, of, mutual, recognition, strategies, being, practiced, where, formal, union, is, not, feasible, an, increasing, trend, has, been, the, sharing, of, church, buildings, by, two, or, more, denominations, either, holding, separate, services, or, a, single, service, with, elements, of, all, traditions, most, traditionalist, catholics, such, as, society, of, saint, pius, x, society, of, saint, pius, v, congregation, of, mary, immaculate, queen, slaves, of, the, immaculate, heart, of, mary, etc, are, almost, universally, opposed, to, ecumenism, with, other, faith, groups, critics, in, the, catholic, church, are, often, critical, of, vatican, ii, documents, that, promote, ecumenism, such, as, nostra, aetate, and, unitatis, redintegratio, catholic, opponents, to, ecumenism, often, cite, preceding, papal, documents, such, as, mortalium, animos, 1928, by, pope, pius, xi, who, considered, the, position, that, the, church, of, christ, can, be, divided, into, sections, and, that, the, unity, of, the, church, has, not, been, achieved, as, a, false, opinion, considering, these, notions, pius, xi, continued, he, apostolic, see, cannot, on, any, terms, take, part, in, assemblies, nor, is, it, anyway, lawful, for, catholics, either, to, support, or, to, work, for, such, enterprises, for, if, they, do, so, they, will, be, giving, countenance, to, a, false, christianity, quite, alien, to, the, one, church, of, christ, shall, we, suffer, what, would, indeed, be, iniquitous, the, truth, and, a, truth, divinely, revealed, to, be, made, a, subject, for, compromise, for, here, there, is, question, of, defending, revealed, truth, many, traditional, leaning, catholics, often, strictly, interpret, the, teaching, of, extra, ecclesiam, nulla, salus, outside, the, church, there, is, no, salvation, or, that, salvation, can, only, be, found, in, the, catholic, church, in, november, 2015, pope, francis, stirred, controversy, among, catholics, when, he, addressed, a, gathering, of, lutherans, in, rome, regarding, the, issue, of, inter, communion, addressing, the, issue, of, a, whether, a, lutheran, woman, married, to, a, catholic, man, and, attended, mass, together, could, receive, communion, together, francis, said, that, while, he, could, not, give, permission, for, her, to, receive, communion, if, she, would, pray, about, it, and, come, forward, he, could, not, deny, her, communion, cardinal, robert, sarah, and, bishop, athanasius, schneider, reacted, to, the, pope, s, comments, saying, it, would, almost, never, be, acceptable, for, a, non, catholic, to, receive, communion, on, the, matter, of, inter, communion, sarah, said, inter, communion, is, not, permitted, between, catholics, and, non, catholics, you, must, confess, the, catholic, faith, a, non, catholic, cannot, receive, communion, that, is, very, very, clear, it, s, not, a, matter, of, following, your, conscience, in, early, 2019, barry, c, knestout, the, 13th, bishop, of, the, roman, catholic, diocese, of, richmond, gave, permission,

southern, virginia, does, not, have, a, cathedral, and, usually, rotates, where, it, hosts, ordinations, and, other, events, however, the, announcement, was, met, with, opposition, by, many, catholics, who, objected, to, holding, a, non, catholic, worship, service, and, women, s, bishop, ordination, in, a, catholic, church, over, 3, 000, people, signed, an, internet, petition, objecting, to, the, event, on, 17, january, the, episcopal, diocese, of, southern, virginia, announced, it, would, no, longer, hold, haynes, ordination, at, st, bede, most, churches, following, the, doctrine, of, confessional, lutheranism, are, generally, strongly, opposed, to, ecumenical, activities, most, notably, the, lutheran, church, missouri, synod, lcms, bars, its, clergy, from, worshiping, with, other, faiths, contending, that, church, fellowship, or, merger, between, church, bodies, in, doctrinal, disagreement, with, one, another, is, not, in, keeping, with, what, the, bible, teaches, about, church, fellowship, in, keeping, with, this, position, a, connecticut, lcms, pastor, was, asked, to, apologize, by, the, president, of, the, denomination, and, did, so, for, participating, in, an, interfaith, prayer, vigil, for, the, 26, children, and, adults, killed, at, a, newtown, elementary, school, and, a, lcms, pastor, in, new, york, was, suspended, for, praying, at, an, interfaith, vigil, in, 2001, twelve, days, after, the, september, 11, attacks, when, the, manhattan, declaration, was, released, many, prominent, evangelical, figures, particularly, of, the, reformed, calvinist, tradition, opposed, it, including, john, f, macarthur, d, james, kennedy, alistair, begg, and, r, c, sproul, william, david, walker, who, was, the, first, bishop, of, north, dakota, 1883, 1896, and, western, new, york, 1897, 1917, was, strongly, opposed, to, dialogue, with, other, denominations, in, his, address, to, the, 1914, convention, of, the, diocese, of, western, new, york, walker, said, that, in, my, opinion, while, divided, christendom, remains, separated, sects, are, better, apart, each, peaceably, working, out, its, own, salvation, there, are, some, members, of, the, united, methodist, church, who, oppose, ecumenical, efforts, which, are, not, grounded, in, the, doctrines, of, the, church, due, to, concerns, over, theological, compromise, for, example, an, article, published, in, catalyst, online, contemporary, evangelical, perspectives, for, united, methodist, seminarians, stated, that, false, ecumenism, might, result, in, the, blurring, of, theological, and, confessional, differences, in, the, interests, of, unity, the, evangelical, wesleyan, church, a, methodist, connexion, in, the, conservative, holiness, movement, teaches, in, its, book, of, discipline, that, ecumenism, with, denominations, that, teach, doctrines, which, contradict, wesleyan, arminian, theology, should, be, avoided, 1, the, church, warns, all, its, members, that, the, doctrine, of, eternal, security, once, in, grace, always, in, grace, the, absolute, final, perseverance, of, the, saints, is, not, in, accord, with, the, teachings, of, the, scriptures, the, word, of, god, plainly, teaches, the, possibility, of, apostasy, and, eternal, damnation, the, scriptural, references, as, alleged, proofs, favoring, this, doctrine, may, be, showing, to, rest, upon, an, assumption, in, each, case, that, the, word, of, god, will, not, substance, therefore, all, our, people, should, exercise, extreme, caution, in, regard, to, the, eternal, security, movement, whose, teachings, have, been, such, a, detriment, to, true, scriptural, holiness, and, productive, of, lives, of, sinning, religion, in, many, especially, should, they, guard, against, financial, support, to, the, same, 2, we, further, warn, against, the, modern, unknown, tongues, and, commercialized, healing, movements, we, believe, that, the, holy, ghost, distributes, his, gifts, dividing, to, every, man, severally, as, he, will, for, the, purpose, of, edification, and, that, it, is, perilous, to, teach, that, any, one, manifestation, of, the, spirit, is, necessary, to, or, an, invariable, accompaniment, of, any, work, of, divine, grace, none, of, our, people, should, support, or, affiliate, with, these, movements, for, their, teachings, also, have, done, untold, damage, to, the,

assembly, of, the, wcc, at, amsterdam, in, 1948, and, has, been, a, consistent, supporter, of, the, work, of, the, wcc, ever, since, many, orthodox, christians, support, the, cause, of, ecumenism, as, espoused, by, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, and, their, autocephalous, churches, however, some, of, the, eastern, orthodox, laity, vehemently, oppose, ecumenism, with, other, christian, denominations, such, people, view, ecumenism, as, well, as, interfaith, dialogue, as, potentially, pernicious, to, eastern, orthodox, church, tradition, as, a, weakening, of, eastern, orthodoxy, itself, in, the, eastern, orthodox, world, the, theological, committee, of, the, sacred, community, of, mount, athos, arguably, the, most, important, center, of, orthodox, spirituality, has, voiced, its, concerns, regarding, the, ecumenist, movement, and, has, expressed, opposition, to, the, participation, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, they, regard, modern, ecumenism, as, compromising, essential, doctrinal, stands, in, order, to, accommodate, other, christians, and, object, to, the, emphasis, on, dialogue, leading, to, intercommunion, rather, than, conversion, on, the, part, of, participants, in, ecumenical, initiatives, greek, old, calendarists, also, claim, that, the, teachings, of, the, seven, ecumenical, councils, forbid, changing, the, church, calendar, through, abandonment, of, the, julian, calendar, the, inter, eastern, orthodox, theological, conference, entitled, ecumenism, origins, expectations, disenchantment, organized, in, september, 2004, by, the, aristotelian, university, of, thessaloniki, drew, negative, conclusions, on, ecumenism, russian, orthodox, bishop, tikhon, shevkunov, has, strongly, criticised, ecumenism, especially, with, the, catholic, church, saying, catholics, are, not, even, a, church, and, as, a, result, not, even, christian, fr, timothy, evangelinidis, of, the, orthodox, research, institute, notes, orthodoxy, also, sees, itself, in, a, fragile, position, within, the, ecumenical, movement, it, is, neither, completely, at, home, within, ecumenism, nor, is, closed, to, other, christian, groups, wishing, to, dialogue, with, it, opposition, to, ecumenism, in, the, orthodox, church, has, its, roots, in, the, teachings, of, many, modern, day, saints, and, monastics, for, example, the, popular, greek, saint, elder, ephraim, of, katounakia, died, 1998, said, when, asked, about, ecumenism, i, went, to, my, cell, and, prayed, asking, christ, to, inform, me, what, ecumenism, is, i, received, his, reply, which, was, that, ecumenism, has, a, spirit, of, wickedness, and, is, dominated, by, unclean, spirits, similarly, the, well, known, saint, paisios, of, mount, athos, died, 1994, gave, many, teachings, about, ecumenism, in, a, private, letter, to, a, priest, named, fr, haralambos, on, 23, january, 1969, elder, paisios, wrote, with, sadness, i, must, write, that, among, all, the, unionists, i, ve, met, never, have, i, seen, them, to, have, either, a, drop, or, shred, of, spirituality, opposition, to, ecumenism, comes, not, only, from, the, laity, and, from, monastics, but, also, from, the, orthodox, clergy, the, popular, rocor, metropolitan, philaret, of, new, york, died, 1985, wrote, a, series, of, three, sorrowful, epistles, from, 1969, to, 1975, against, ecumenism, in, which, he, called, ecumenism, an, error, the, anti, ecumenical, words, of, such, prominent, and, highly, respected, figures, in, the, orthodox, church, garners, attention, from, many, members, of, the, clergy, and, laity, some, seventh, day, adventists, express, a, visceral, rejection, of, ecumenism, apparently, linked, to, a, traditional, adventist, dislike, of, the, roman, catholic, church, the, state, atheism, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, which, brought, about, a, persecution, of, christians, caused, a, rise, in, christian, nationalism, in, the, west, as, well, as, ecumenical, cooperation, among, christians, across, denominational, lines, for, example, the, united, states, in, 1956, adopted, in, god, we, trust, as, its, official, motto, to, differentiate, itself, from, the, soviet,
