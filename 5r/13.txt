fajia, chinese, pinyin, f, ji, or, the, school, of, fa, laws, methods, often, translated, as, legalism, is, a, school, of, mainly, warring, states, period, classical, chinese, philosophy, whose, ideas, contributed, greatly, to, the, formation, of, the, bureaucratic, chinese, empire, and, daoism, as, prominent, in, the, early, han, the, later, han, takes, guan, zhong, as, a, forefather, of, the, fajia, its, more, legalistic, figures, include, ministers, li, kui, and, shang, yang, and, more, daoistic, figures, shen, buhai, and, philosopher, shen, dao, with, the, late, han, fei, drawing, on, both, it, is, often, characterized, in, the, west, along, realist, lines, the, qin, to, tang, were, more, characterized, by, its, traditions, though, the, origins, of, the, chinese, administrative, system, cannot, be, traced, to, any, one, person, grand, chancellor, shen, buhai, may, have, had, more, influence, than, any, other, for, the, construction, of, the, merit, system, and, could, be, considered, its, founder, his, philosophical, successor, han, fei, regarded, as, their, finest, writer, wrote, the, most, acclaimed, of, their, texts, the, han, feizi, containing, some, of, the, earliest, commentaries, on, the, daodejing, sun, tzu, s, art, of, war, recommends, han, fei, s, concepts, of, power, technique, inaction, impartiality, punishment, and, reward, concerned, largely, with, administrative, and, sociopolitical, innovation, shang, yang, s, reforms, transformed, the, peripheral, qin, state, into, a, militarily, powerful, and, strongly, centralized, kingdom, mobilizing, the, qin, to, ultimate, conquest, of, the, other, states, of, china, in, 221, bce, with, an, administrative, influence, for, the, qin, dynasty, he, had, a, formative, influence, for, chinese, law, succeeding, emperors, and, reformers, often, followed, the, templates, set, by, han, fei, shen, buhai, and, shang, yang, early, a, remote, backwater, to, the, west, although, propelling, the, qin, to, power, china, likely, know, the, qin, state, s, shang, yang, until, at, least, the, eve, of, imperial, unification, knowing, of, shen, buhai, shen, dao, and, the, qin, even, the, late, xun, kuang, would, not, seem, to, know, shang, yang, despite, traditional, comparisons, shen, buhai, can, only, speculatively, be, compared, with, li, kui, or, the, even, older, confucian, zichan, at, the, broad, level, that, they, mutually, sought, more, meritocratic, government, and, with, evidence, of, direct, influence, lacking, as, chancellors, of, neighboring, states, the, doctrines, of, shang, yang, and, shen, buhai, would, have, encountered, one, another, by, the, qin, dynasty, and, the, late, han, feizi, associated, with, the, purported, han, fei, of, the, hann, state, is, shang, yang, s, first, reference, outside, the, qin, state, s, own, book, of, lord, shang, the, han, feizi, would, suggest, that, the, laws, and, methods, of, shang, yang, and, guan, zhong, with, their, associated, works, may, have, circulated, at, that, time, chapter, 24, of, the, book, of, lord, shang, demonstrates, familiarity, with, concepts, associated, with, shen, buhai, and, shen, dao, but, the, concepts, had, become, common, by, that, time, while, the, warring, states, period, otherwise, contains, figures, that, can, partly, be, called, legalistic, with, the, han, feizi, as, shang, yang, s, first, reference, it, is, only, possible, to, trace, the, origins, of, their, later, association, within, the, fajia, to, the, first, direct, connection, between, him, and, shen, buhai, which, yuri, pines, still, placed, in, chapter, 43, of, the, han, feizi, set, against, a, backdrop, of, the, late, warring, states, period, s, hann, state, under, the, threat, of, qin, han, fei, considered, fa, standards, as, including, law, necessary, taking, shang, yang, as, representative, as, well, as, the, use, of, standards, fa, in, the, administration, representative, of, his, own, state, s, shen, buhai, the, latter, he, terms, shu, administrative, method, or, technique, concerned, with, holding, power, selecting, ministers, and, overseeing, performance, potentially, influential, for, the, founding, of, the, imperial, examination, according, to, han, fei, and, the, huainanzi, shen, buhai, had, disorganized, law, in, the, time, of, the, newly, formed, hann, state, no, han, or, earlier, text, individually, connects, him, with, penal, law, but, only, with, control, of, bureaucracy, and, appears, to, have, opposed, penal, punishment, shen, buhai, s, administrative, ideas, would, be, relevant, for, penal, practice, by, the, han, dynasty, but, can, still, be, seen, in, a, fifth, century, work, quoting, liu, xiang, as, a, figure, who, advocated, administrative, technique, supervision, and, accountability, to, abolish, the, punishment, of, ministers, and, likely, did, contribute, to, a, reduction, in, punishment, although, some, prominent, reformers, did, use, them, together, the, three, still, had, their, own, individual, influences, from, the, time, of, the, han, feizi, s, synthesis, onward, shang, yang, shen, buhai, and, han, fei, were, often, identified, under, han, fei, s, administrative, practice, of, xing, ming, form, and, name, inherited, from, shen, buhai, it, would, serve, a, secondary, moniker, though, xing, forms, are, defined, similarly, to, fa, concept, as, a, category, likely, invented, by, sima, tan, 165, 110, bce, in, a, discourse, on, government, their, several, prominent, are, under, the, school, of, fa, fajia, because, liu, xiang, 77, 6bce, and, liu, xin, c, 46bce, 23ce, used, it, as, a, category, in, the, han, dynasty, imperial, library, fajia, legalism, would, become, a, major, category, of, masters, texts, in, han, dynasty, catalogues, namely, the, han, state, s, own, book, of, han, 111ce, it, included, six, other, lost, texts, although, xun, kuang, criticized, shen, dao, as, obsessed, with, fa, fajia, likely, only, meant, law, abiding, families, in, the, time, of, mencius, no, one, had, used, it, as, an, ideological, term, for, himself, his, or, opponent, its, rare, term, might, have, evolved, to, mean, something, like, methods, expert, in, economic, affairs, in, the, context, of, the, guanzi, before, tan, s, variant, before, popular, as, used, in, the, shiji, sima, tan, fajia, would, appear, purely, ideological, referring, to, the, view, that, kinship, and, social, status, should, be, disregarded, by, administrative, protocols, treating, everyone, equally, and, thereby, elevating, the, sovereign, over, the, rest, of, humanity, although, a, broad, earlier, economical, meaning, for, the, term, itself, would, be, more, suppositional, sima, qian, highlights, the, book, of, lord, shang, s, chapter, 3, on, agriculture, and, war, while, liu, xiang, would, go, on, to, suggest, that, shang, yang, and, li, kui, had, been, influenced, by, the, agriculturally, focused, shennong, a, primary, concern, of, the, early, book, of, lord, shang, sinologist, yuri, pines, stanford, encyclopedia, still, considers, an, inclusion, of, rich, states, and, powerful, armies, a, more, accurate, descriptor, for, the, current, than, just, fa, laws, and, methods, while, concepts, like, fa, were, earlier, developed, by, the, mohists, figures, like, shen, buhai, shen, dao, and, han, fei, would, be, otherwise, associated, with, what, would, retrospectively, be, termed, early, daoism, with, the, eclectic, han, feizi, a, daoist, influenced, text, coming, to, mean, something, like, daoism, sima, tan, likely, coined, the, term, daojia, with, huang, lao, content, in, mind, under, which, sima, qian, includes, shen, buhai, shen, dao, and, han, fei, though, han, fei, early, distinguishes, shang, yang, from, shen, buhai, and, the, huainanzi, for, it, s, interests, would, not, seem, to, endorse, shen, buhai, before, the, later, han, the, figures, were, not, yet, distinguished, into, two, different, schools, and, were, likely, not, seen, as, two, distinct, schools, with, no, one, then, named, under, them, daojia, would, be, pointed, to, refer, to, laozi, and, zhuangzi, as, founding, examples, with, the, confucians, interpreting, the, present, figures, into, the, fa, school, placing, the, biographies, of, shen, buhai, and, han, fei, alongside, laozi, and, zhuangzi, along, with, founding, han, figures, sima, qian, claimed, han, fei, shen, buhai, and, shen, dao, as, having, studied, his, same, huang, lao, philosophy, or, yellow, emperor, and, laozi, daoism, shang, yang, is, simply, given, his, own, chapter, shen, dao, is, listed, under, the, jixia, academy, sima, qian, blames, li, si, as, purportedly, combining, shen, buhai, and, han, fei, s, doctrine, identified, as, technique, with, shang, yang, s, doctrine, of, law, depicting, li, si, as, inflicting, heavy, taxes, and, abusing, shen, buha, s, doctrine, to, encourage, the, indolence, and, subservience, of, the, second, emperor, although, earlier, sinologists, might, treat, them, as, belonging, to, the, same, legalism, category, sima, qian, for, his, part, does, not, treat, han, fei, the, same, as, li, si, framing, the, two, as, opponents, han, fei, is, treated, as, a, tragic, figure, han, texts, shiji, gongyang, zhuan, yan, tie, lun, and, huainanzi, instead, depict, confucius, as, a, legalist, probably, alluding, to, a, cruel, official, under, the, emperor, wu, of, han, the, term, huang, lao, might, be, retrospective, and, some, of, the, han, feizi, s, more, daoistic, chapters, might, be, late, additions, but, the, latter, would, be, less, relevant, for, the, case, of, the, qin, or, huang, lao, as, a, view, still, espoused, by, sinologist, hansen, of, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, daoism, a, legalism, as, including, the, guanzi, s, current, and, a, huang, lao, yellow, emperor, daoism, dominant, in, the, qin, to, early, han, would, theoretically, be, borne, out, by, the, mawangdui, silk, texts, if, huang, lao, did, describe, a, self, conscious, current, it, would, have, been, more, of, a, tendency, than, a, unified, doctrine, with, early, huang, lao, han, dynasty, administrators, named, by, sima, qian, like, cao, shen, taking, a, more, hands, off, approach, after, the, fall, of, the, qin, dynasty, more, political, than, a, typical, reading, of, the, daodejing, and, less, metaphysical, than, later, daoist, texts, han, fei, may, be, reading, from, an, older, more, political, version, with, the, mawangdui, found, from, a, member, of, the, political, class, hansen, argued, these, version, should, not, be, simply, assumed, as, originals, interpreting, huang, lao, as, an, early, politically, partisan, variety, of, daoism, their, texts, would, arguably, written, in, the, early, han, when, its, political, positions, would, have, been, more, appealing, but, michael, loewe, still, placed, its, jingfa, before, qin, unification, the, yellow, emperor, is, at, least, major, figure, in, one, of, its, texts, amongst, other, strains, of, thought, its, more, metaphysical, but, still, politically, oriented, boshu, text, includes, contents, bearing, resemblance, to, shen, buhai, shen, dao, and, han, fei, favoring, arguments, more, comparable, to, natural, law, an, interpretation, of, the, daodejing, laozi, as, simply, cynically, political, would, be, flawed, still, together, with, qigong, it, can, be, viewed, as, a, manual, for, politics, and, military, strategy, the, laozi, of, the, early, mawangdui, silk, texts, and, two, of, the, three, earlier, guodian, chu, slips, place, political, commentaries, or, ruling, the, state, first, arguably, lacking, in, metaphysics, associated, content, instead, possesses, mythologies, nonetheless, in, contrast, to, all, prior, ways, the, daodejing, emphasizes, quietude, and, lack, as, wu, wei, a, central, concept, of, daoism, together, especially, with, their, early, laozi, shen, buhai, han, fei, and, so, called, huang, lao, daoism, emphasize, the, political, usages, and, advantages, of, wu, wei, reduced, activity, as, a, method, of, control, for, survival, social, stability, long, life, and, rule, refraining, from, action, in, order, to, take, advantage, of, favorable, developments, in, affairs, the, han, feizi, s, late, daodejing, commentaries, are, comparable, with, the, daoism, of, the, guanzi, neiye, but, otherwise, utilizes, the, laozi, more, as, a, theme, for, methods, of, rule, although, the, han, feizi, has, daoistic, conceptions, of, objective, viewpoints, if, his, sources, had, them, he, lacks, a, conclusive, belief, in, universal, moralities, or, natural, laws, sharing, with, shang, yang, and, shen, dao, a, view, of, man, as, self, interested, advocating, against, manipulation, of, the, mechanisms, of, government, despite, an, advocacy, of, passive, mindfulness, noninterference, and, quiescence, the, ability, to, prescribe, and, command, is, still, built, into, han, fei, s, xing, ming, administration, his, current, is, opposed, with, later, daoism, as, a, practical, state, philosophy, not, accepting, a, permanent, way, of, statecraft, and, applying, the, practice, of, wu, wei, or, non, action, more, to, the, ruler, than, anyone, else, the, early, work, of, feng, youlan, took, the, statesmen, as, fully, understanding, that, needs, change, with, the, times, and, material, circumstances, admitting, that, people, may, have, been, more, virtuous, anciently, han, fei, believes, that, new, problems, require, new, solutions, in, fact, a, changing, with, times, paradigm, itself, was, common, enough, pines, takes, shang, yang, and, han, fei, s, more, specific, view, of, history, as, an, evolutionary, process, as, contrasting, sinologist, hansen, also, once, took, the, dao, of, shen, dao, and, han, fei, as, attempting, to, aim, at, what, they, took, to, be, the, actual, course, of, history, stressing, timeliness, sima, tan, says, it, the, dao, or, way, shifts, with, the, times, and, changes, in, response, to, things, a, view, earlier, found, in, han, fei, and, xun, kuang, hong, kong, professor, xiaogan, liu, takes, the, zhuangzi, and, laozi, tao, te, ching, as, more, focused, on, according, with, nature, than, timeliness, with, the, huang, lao, followers, of, zhuangzi, defining, the, former, according, to, the, latter, considering, shang, yang, to, have, inherited, from, li, kui, and, wu, qi, professor, ch, ien, mu, said, that, people, say, merely, that, legalist, origins, are, in, dao, and, de, power, virtue, apparently, not, aware, that, their, origins, in, fact, are, in, confucianism, their, observance, of, law, and, sense, of, public, justice, are, wholly, in, the, spirit, of, confucius, rectification, of, names, and, return, to, propriety, but, transformed, in, accordance, with, the, conditions, of, the, age, in, the, ancient, society, punishment, by, law, would, typically, only, apply, to, the, people, while, the, nobles, are, only, punished, by, ritual, but, needs, change, with, the, times, hu, shih, took, xun, kuang, han, fei, and, li, si, as, champions, of, the, idea, of, progress, through, conscious, human, effort, with, li, si, abolishing, the, feudal, system, unifying, the, empire, law, language, thought, and, belief, presenting, a, memorial, to, the, throne, in, which, he, condemns, all, those, who, refused, to, study, the, present, and, believed, only, in, the, ancients, on, whose, authority, they, dared, to, criticize, with, a, quotation, from, xun, kuang, you, glorify, nature, and, meditate, on, her, why, not, domesticate, and, regulate, her, you, follow, nature, and, sing, her, praise, why, not, control, her, course, and, use, it, therefore, i, say, to, neglect, man, s, effort, and, speculate, about, nature, is, to, misunderstand, the, facts, of, the, universe, in, contrast, to, xun, kuang, as, the, classically, purported, teacher, of, han, fei, and, li, si, han, fei, does, not, believe, that, a, tendency, to, disorder, demonstrates, that, people, are, evil, or, unruly, in, what, a, c, graham, took, to, be, a, highly, literary, fiction, as, pines, recalls, the, book, of, lord, shang, s, chapter, 1, revising, the, laws, opens, with, a, debate, held, by, duke, xiao, of, qin, seeking, to, consider, the, changes, in, the, affairs, of, the, age, inquire, into, the, basis, for, correcting, standards, and, seek, the, way, to, employ, the, people, gongsun, attempts, to, persuade, the, duke, to, change, with, the, times, with, the, shangjunshu, citing, him, as, saying, orderly, generations, did, not, a, single, way, to, benefit, the, state, one, need, not, imitate, antiquity, graham, compares, han, fei, in, particular, with, the, malthusians, as, unique, in, seeking, a, historical, cause, of, changing, conditions, namely, population, growth, acknowledging, that, an, underpopulated, society, only, need, moral, ties, the, guanzi, text, sees, punishment, as, unnecessary, in, ancient, times, with, an, abundance, of, resources, making, it, a, question, of, poverty, rather, than, human, nature, human, nature, is, a, confucian, issue, graham, otherwise, considers, the, customs, current, of, the, time, as, having, no, significance, to, the, statesmen, even, if, they, may, be, willing, to, conform, the, government, to, them, as, a, counterpoint, han, fei, and, shen, dao, do, still, employ, argumentative, reference, to, sage, kings, han, fei, claims, the, distinction, between, the, ruler, s, interests, and, private, interests, as, said, to, date, back, to, cangjie, while, government, by, fa, standards, is, said, to, date, back, to, time, immemorial, han, fei, considers, the, demarcation, between, public, and, private, a, key, element, in, the, enlightened, governance, of, the, purported, former, kings, with, the, shangjunshu, making, a, predominant, usage, of, law, and, with, han, fei, and, the, han, dynasty, largely, connecting, him, with, penal, law, sinologist, herrlee, g, creel, took, shang, yang, as, ancient, china, s, legalist, school, but, shang, yang, s, program, was, broader, than, law, han, fei, elementalizes, him, under, it, per, michael, loewe, ministerial, recruitment, occurred, amidst, warring, states, period, mobilization, with, the, book, of, lord, shang, a, primary, example, early, ministerial, recruitment, more, broadly, was, focused, more, simply, on, census, and, taxes, for, mobilization, developing, towards, such, offices, as, that, of, diplomats, penal, law, aside, benjamin, i, schwartz, took, shang, yang, s, primary, program, to, be, agriculture, and, war, acknowledging, their, bureaucratic, contributions, pine, s, work, in, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, prefaces, a, shang, yang, han, fei, primary, current, along, realist, lines, as, seeking, rich, states, with, powerful, armies, the, actual, perspective, of, his, current, was, probably, that, of, trying, to, create, a, rich, total, state, with, a, powerful, army, all, geared, for, conquest, as, expressed, in, the, book, of, lord, shang, translator, yuri, pines, frames, him, more, along, these, lines, penal, law, was, one, component, including, a, dominating, focus, on, agriculture, that, was, later, abandoned, together, with, his, harsh, punishments, shang, yang, s, institutional, reforms, can, be, considered, unprecedented, and, his, economic, and, political, reforms, were, unqestionably, more, important, than, his, own, personal, military, achievements, but, the, han, still, recognized, him, as, a, military, strategist, and, he, was, as, much, a, military, reformer, in, his, own, time, even, if, he, wasn, t, as, renowned, a, general, he, is, also, categorized, under, the, han, imperial, library, s, military, books, subjection, strategists, with, shang, yang, said, to, have, reformed, qin, law, the, book, of, lord, shang, does, not, believe, that, fa, laws, will, be, successful, without, investigating, the, people, s, disposition, pines, takes, shang, yang, s, primary, doctrine, to, be, that, of, connecting, people, s, inborn, nature, or, dispositions, xing, with, names, ming, the, work, recommends, enacting, laws, that, allow, people, to, pursue, the, desire, for, a, name, namely, fame, and, high, social, status, or, just, wealth, if, acceptable, ensuring, that, these, names, are, connected, with, actual, benefits, it, was, hoped, that, if, people, are, able, to, pursue, these, they, will, be, less, likely, to, commit, crimes, and, more, likely, to, engage, in, hard, work, or, fight, in, wars, a, figure, in, the, stratagems, of, the, warring, states, although, not, the, primary, focus, of, his, administrative, treatise, shen, buhai, was, also, a, military, reformer, at, least, for, defense, and, is, said, to, have, maintained, the, security, of, his, state, shen, dao, was, early, remembered, for, his, secondary, subject, of, shi, or, situational, authority, of, which, he, is, spoken, in, chapter, 40, of, the, han, feizi, and, incorporated, into, the, art, of, war, but, only, uses, the, term, twice, in, his, fragments, taking, his, opponents, as, beclouded, in, various, ways, xun, kuang, calls, him, beclouded, with, fa, prominent, in, his, work, as, shared, with, the, others, otherwise, teaching, passivity, and, the, elimination, of, desire, taking, his, opponents, as, beclouded, by, particular, aspects, of, the, way, xun, kuang, criticizes, shen, dao, in, particular, as, obsessed, with, the, emulation, of, models, fa, rather, than, the, employment, of, worthy, men, but, not, necessarily, deciding, on, one, as, correct, shen, dao, was, more, concerned, that, there, be, laws, than, with, their, particulars, xun, kuang, is, of, the, opinion, that, his, laws, or, models, lack, proper, foundations, and, will, not, be, successful, in, ordering, the, state, but, he, doesn, t, oppose, him, just, for, advocating, fa, models, or, laws, xun, kuang, also, discusses, fa, rather, than, law, itself, he, opposes, litigation, and, paradoxes, as, found, in, the, school, of, names, prior, sima, tan, doctrines, were, identified, only, by, teachers, in, connection, with, textual, traditions, for, those, later, termed, daoists, namely, the, early, laozi, and, zhuangzi, not, forming, large, scale, organized, continuous, schools, of, masters, and, disciples, in, the, sense, of, the, mohists, and, confucians, those, later, termed, daoists, formed, loose, networks, of, master, and, disciple, in, the, warring, states, period, as, text, based, traditions, brought, together, more, fully, in, the, han, dynasty, some, later, termed, legalists, may, have, been, earlier, than, the, daodejing, but, it, would, almost, go, without, saying, that, a, figure, like, han, fei, would, be, influenced, by, the, emergence, of, daoism, many, confucians, would, come, to, be, influenced, by, it, as, well, early, daoists, were, likely, not, aware, of, their, whole, field, for, the, han, feizi, too, zhuangzi, influences, only, exists, as, traces, and, the, mawangdui, silk, texts, still, lacked, zhuangzi, influences, the, main, evidence, of, zhuangzi, influence, in, the, han, dynasty, is, the, huainanzi, professor, tao, jiang, more, simply, refers, to, han, fei, s, laozi, influences, as, laoist, only, theorizing, zhuangist, type, influences, he, theorizes, these, as, wariness, by, the, monarch, of, manipulation, retreating, into, wu, wei, isolation, rather, than, confucian, style, moral, education, and, cultivation, hermits, in, the, zhuangzi, retreat, into, isolation, to, avoid, the, chaos, of, the, age, while, potentially, late, additions, the, han, feizi, s, authors, wrote, commentaries, on, the, daodejing, these, earlier, commentators, provide, no, comment, distinguishing, themselves, or, han, fei, s, current, from, that, of, laozi, and, did, not, necessarily, see, two, distinct, schools, it, still, modernly, seems, plausible, to, read, hanfei, within, the, daoist, dimension, as, a, thinker, influenced, by, daoism, xun, kuang, individually, distinguishes, shen, dao, for, fa, and, their, figures, have, been, argued, to, be, focused, on, fa, administrative, methods, and, standards, but, it, wasn, t, his, exclusive, theme, and, the, han, feizi, s, authors, were, also, focused, on, daoistic, concepts, wu, wei, and, dao, the, currents, termed, daoist, and, legalist, would, have, had, more, in, common, with, their, contemporaries, than, their, later, division, would, suggest, which, did, not, exist, basing, himself, in, administrative, impartiality, and, showing, both, daoist, and, confucian, characteristics, shen, buhai, can, still, modernly, be, taken, as, a, more, confucian, cooperative, figure, than, might, be, supposed, from, the, scheming, of, han, fei, s, later, chapters, and, does, not, appear, to, directly, attack, confucianism, although, han, fei, would, generally, be, considered, authoritarian, neither, were, figures, like, shen, dao, necessarily, more, authoritarian, for, their, time, advocating, that, administrative, machinery, fa, be, used, to, impartially, determine, rewards, and, punishments, shen, dao, otherwise, advocates, that, the, realm, be, literally, modeled, off, the, natural, world, discarding, the, use, of, his, ears, eyes, and, wisdom, in, contrast, to, daoism, as, later, understood, with, dao, referring, to, such, things, as, the, totality, of, reality, shen,
