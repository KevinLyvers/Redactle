beliefs, three, principles, are, central, to, these, teachings, the, unity, of, god, the, unity, of, religion, and, the, unity, of, humanity, bah, s, believe, that, god, periodically, reveals, his, will, through, divine, messengers, whose, purpose, is, to, transform, the, character, of, humankind, and, to, develop, within, those, who, respond, moral, and, spiritual, qualities, religion, is, thus, seen, as, orderly, unified, and, progressive, from, age, to, age, bah, writings, describe, a, single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and, almighty, god, who, is, the, creator, of, all, things, in, the, universe, the, existence, of, god, and, the, universe, are, thought, to, be, eternal, with, no, beginning, or, end, even, though, god, is, not, directly, accessible, he, is, seen, as, being, conscious, of, creation, with, a, will, and, a, purpose, which, is, expressed, through, messengers, who, are, called, manifestations, of, god, the, bah, conception, of, god, is, of, an, unknowable, essence, who, is, the, source, of, all, existence, and, known, through, the, perception, of, human, virtues, in, another, sense, bah, teachings, on, god, are, also, panentheistic, seeing, signs, of, god, in, all, things, but, the, reality, of, god, being, exalted, and, above, the, physical, world, bah, teachings, state, that, god, is, too, great, for, humans, to, fully, comprehend, and, based, on, them, humans, cannot, create, a, complete, and, accurate, image, of, god, by, themselves, therefore, human, understanding, of, god, is, achieved, through, the, recognition, of, the, person, of, the, manifestation, and, through, the, understanding, of, his, revelations, via, his, manifestations, in, the, bah, faith, god, is, often, referred, to, by, titles, and, attributes, for, example, the, all, powerful, or, the, all, loving, and, there, is, a, substantial, emphasis, on, monotheism, bah, teachings, state, that, these, attributes, do, not, apply, to, god, directly, but, are, used, to, translate, godliness, into, human, terms, and, to, help, people, concentrate, on, their, own, attributes, in, worshipping, god, to, develop, their, potential, on, their, spiritual, path, according, to, the, bah, teachings, the, human, purpose, is, to, learn, to, know, and, love, god, through, such, methods, as, prayer, reflection, and, being, of, service, to, others, bah, notions, of, progressive, religious, revelation, result, in, their, accepting, the, validity, of, the, well, known, religions, of, the, world, whose, founders, and, central, figures, are, seen, as, manifestations, of, god, religious, history, is, interpreted, as, a, series, of, dispensations, where, each, manifestation, brings, a, somewhat, broader, and, more, advanced, revelation, that, is, rendered, as, a, text, of, scripture, and, passed, on, through, history, with, greater, or, lesser, reliability, but, at, least, true, in, substance, suited, for, the, time, and, place, in, which, it, was, expressed, specific, religious, social, teachings, for, example, the, direction, of, prayer, or, dietary, restrictions, may, be, revoked, by, a, subsequent, manifestation, so, that, a, more, appropriate, requirement, for, the, time, and, place, may, be, established, conversely, certain, general, principles, for, example, neighbourliness, or, charity, are, seen, to, be, universal, and, consistent, in, bah, belief, this, process, of, progressive, revelation, will, not, end, it, is, however, believed, to, be, cyclical, bah, s, do, not, expect, a, new, manifestation, of, god, to, appear, within, 1000, years, of, bah, u, ll, h, s, revelation, bah, s, assert, that, their, religion, is, a, distinct, tradition, with, its, own, scriptures, and, laws, and, not, a, sect, of, another, religion, most, religious, specialists, now, see, it, as, an, independent, religion, with, its, religious, background, in, shi, a, islam, being, seen, as, analogous, to, the, jewish, context, in, which, christianity, was, established, bah, s, describe, their, faith, as, an, independent, world, religion, differing, from, the, other, traditions, in, its, relative, age, and, modern, context, the, bah, writings, state, that, human, beings, have, a, rational, soul, and, that, this, provides, the, species, with, a, unique, capacity, to, recognize, god, s, status, and, humanity, s, relationship, with, its, creator, every, human, is, seen, to, have, a, duty, to, recognize, god, through, his, messengers, and, to, conform, to, their, teachings, through, recognition, and, obedience, service, to, humanity, and, regular, prayer, and, spiritual, practice, the, bah, writings, state, that, the, soul, becomes, closer, to, god, the, spiritual, ideal, in, bah, belief, according, to, bah, belief, when, a, human, dies, the, soul, is, permanently, separated, from, the, body, and, carries, on, in, the, next, world, where, it, is, judged, based, on, the, person, s, actions, in, the, physical, world, heaven, and, hell, are, taught, to, be, spiritual, states, of, nearness, or, distance, from, god, that, describe, relationships, in, this, world, and, the, next, and, not, physical, places, of, reward, and, punishment, achieved, after, death, the, bah, writings, emphasize, the, essential, equality, of, human, beings, and, the, abolition, of, prejudice, humanity, is, seen, as, essentially, one, though, highly, varied, its, diversity, of, race, and, culture, are, seen, as, worthy, of, appreciation, and, acceptance, doctrines, of, racism, nationalism, caste, social, class, and, gender, based, hierarchy, are, seen, as, artificial, impediments, to, unity, the, bah, teachings, state, that, the, unification, of, humanity, is, the, paramount, issue, in, the, religious, and, political, conditions, of, the, present, world, when, abdu, l, bah, first, traveled, to, europe, and, america, in, 1911, 1912, he, gave, public, talks, that, articulated, the, basic, principles, of, the, bah, faith, these, included, preaching, on, the, equality, of, men, and, women, race, unity, the, need, for, world, peace, and, other, progressive, ideas, for, the, early, 20th, century, published, summaries, of, the, bah, teachings, often, include, a, list, of, these, principles, and, lists, vary, in, wording, and, what, is, included, the, concept, of, the, unity, of, humankind, seen, by, bah, s, as, an, ancient, truth, is, the, starting, point, for, many, of, the, ideas, the, equality, of, races, and, the, elimination, of, extremes, of, wealth, and, poverty, for, example, are, implications, of, that, unity, another, outgrowth, of, the, concept, is, the, need, for, a, united, world, federation, and, some, practical, recommendations, to, encourage, its, realization, involve, the, establishment, of, a, universal, language, a, standard, economy, and, system, of, measurement, universal, compulsory, education, and, an, international, court, of, arbitration, to, settle, disputes, between, nations, nationalism, according, to, this, viewpoint, should, be, abandoned, in, favor, of, allegiance, to, the, whole, of, humankind, with, regard, to, the, pursuit, of, world, peace, bah, u, ll, h, prescribed, a, world, embracing, collective, security, arrangement, other, bah, social, principles, revolve, around, spiritual, unity, religion, is, viewed, as, progressive, from, age, to, age, but, to, recognize, a, newer, revelation, one, has, to, abandon, tradition, and, independently, investigate, bah, s, are, taught, to, view, religion, as, a, source, of, unity, and, religious, prejudice, as, destructive, science, is, also, viewed, in, harmony, with, true, religion, though, bah, u, ll, h, and, abdu, l, bah, called, for, a, united, world, that, is, free, of, war, they, also, anticipate, that, over, the, long, term, the, establishment, of, a, lasting, peace, the, most, great, peace, and, the, purging, of, the, overwhelming, corruptions, requires, that, the, people, of, the, world, unite, under, a, universal, faith, with, spiritual, virtues, and, ethics, to, complement, material, civilization, shoghi, effendi, the, head, of, the, religion, from, 1921, to, 1957, wrote, the, following, summary, of, what, he, considered, to, be, the, distinguishing, principles, of, bah, u, ll, h, s, teachings, which, he, said, together, with, the, laws, and, ordinances, of, the, kit, b, i, aqdas, constitute, the, bedrock, of, the, bah, faith, the, independent, search, after, truth, unfettered, by, superstition, or, tradition, the, oneness, of, the,
