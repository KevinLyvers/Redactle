group, or, it, may, simply, be, the, voluntary, action, of, its, members, such, punishments, may, include, shunning, excommunication, verbal, abuse, physical, violence, or, even, execution, the, american, sociologist, lewis, a, coser, following, the, german, philosopher, and, sociologist, max, scheler, defines, an, apostate, as, not, just, a, person, who, experienced, a, dramatic, change, in, conviction, but, a, man, who, even, in, his, new, state, of, belief, is, spiritually, living, not, primarily, in, the, content, of, that, faith, in, the, pursuit, of, goals, appropriate, to, it, but, only, in, the, struggle, against, the, old, faith, and, for, the, sake, of, its, negation, the, american, sociologist, david, g, bromley, defined, the, apostate, role, as, follows, and, distinguished, it, from, the, defector, and, whistleblower, roles, stuart, a, wright, an, american, sociologist, and, author, asserts, that, apostasy, is, a, unique, phenomenon, and, a, distinct, type, of, religious, defection, in, which, the, apostate, is, a, defector, who, is, aligned, with, an, oppositional, coalition, in, an, effort, to, broaden, the, dispute, and, embraces, public, claims, making, activities, to, attack, his, or, her, former, group, the, united, nations, commission, on, human, rights, considers, the, recanting, of, a, person, s, religion, a, human, right, legally, protected,

adhere, to, their, religious, beliefs, and, congregations, to, recant, their, religion, or, belief, or, to, convert, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, ad, apostasy, against, the, zoroastrian, faith, in, the, sasanian, empire, was, criminalized, the, high, priest, kidir, instigated, pogroms, against, jews, christians, buddhists, and, others, in, an, effort, to, solidify, the, hold, of, the, state, religion, as, the, roman, empire, adopted, christianity, as, its, state, religion, apostasy, became, formally, criminalized, in, the, theodosian, code, followed, by, the, corpus, juris, civilis, the, justinian, code, the, justinian, code, went, on, to, form, the, basis, of, law, in, most, of, western, europe, during, the, middle, ages, and, so, apostasy, was, similarly, persecuted, to, varying, degrees, in, europe, throughout, this, period, and, into, the, early, modern, period, eastern, europe, similarly, inherited, many, of, its, legal, traditions, regarding, apostasy, from, the, romans, but, not, from, the, justinian, code, medieval, sects, deemed, heretical, such, as, the, waldensians, were, considered, apostates, by, the, church, the, term, atrocity, story, also, referred, to, as, an, atrocity, tale, as, it, is, defined, by, the, american, sociologists, david, g, bromley, and, anson, d, shupe, refers, to, the, symbolic, presentation, of, action, or, events, real, or, imaginary, in, such, a, context, that, they, are, made, flagrantly, to, violate, the, presumably, shared, premises, upon, which, a, given, set, of, social, relationships, should, be, conducted, the, recounting, of, such, tales, is, intended, as, a, means, of, reaffirming, normative, boundaries, by, sharing, the, reporter, s, disapproval, or, horror, an, audience, reasserts, normative, prescription, and, clearly, locates, the, violator, beyond, the, limits, of, public, morality, the, term, was, coined, in, 1979, by, bromley, shupe, and, joseph, ventimiglia, bromley, and, others, define, an, atrocity, as, an, event, that, is, perceived, as, a, flagrant, violation, of, a, fundamental, value, it, contains, the, following, three, elements, the, term, atrocity, story, is, controversial, as, it, relates, to, the, differing, views, amongst, scholars, about, the, credibility, of, the, accounts, of, former, members, bryan, r, wilson, reader, emeritus, of, sociology, of, the, university, of, oxford, says, apostates, of, new, religious, movements, are, generally, in, need, of, self, justification, seeking, to, reconstruct, their, past, and, to, excuse, their, former, affiliations, while, blaming, those, who, were, formerly, their, closest, associates, wilson, thus, challenges, the, reliability, of, the, apostate, s, testimony, by, saying, that, the, apostate, must, always, be, seen, as, one, whose, personal, history, predisposes, him, to, bias, with, respect, to, both, his, previous, religious, commitment, and, affiliations, and, the, suspicion, must, arise, that, he, acts, from, a, personal, motivation, to, vindicate, himself, and, to, regain, his, self, esteem, by, showing, himself, to, have, been, first, a, victim, but, subsequently, to, have, become, a, redeemed, crusader, wilson, also, asserts, that, some, apostates, or, defectors, from, religious, organisations, rehearse, atrocity, stories, to, explain, how, by, manipulation, coercion, or, deceit, they, were, recruited, to, groups, that, they, now, condemn, jean, duhaime, of, the, universit, de, montr, al, writes, referring, to, wilson, based, on, his, analysis, of, three, books, by, apostates, of, new, religious, movements, that, stories, of, apostates, cannot, be, dismissed, only, because, they, are, subjective, danny, jorgensen, professor, at, the, department, of, religious, studies, of, the, university, of, florida, in, his, book, the, social, construction, and, interpretation, of, deviance, jonestown, and, the, mass, media, argues, that, the, role, of, the, media, in, constructing, and, reflecting, reality, is, particularly, apparent, in, its, coverage, of, cults, he, asserts, that, this, complicity, exists, partly, because, apostates, with, an, atrocity, story, to, tell, make, themselves, readily, available, to, reporters, and, partly, because, new, religious, movements, have, learned, to, be, suspicious, of, the, media, and, therefore, have, not, been, open, to, investigative, reporters, writing, stories, on, their, movement, from, an, insider, s, perspective, besides, this, lack, of, information, about, the, experiences, of, people, within, new, religious, movements, the, media, is, attracted, to, sensational, stories, featuring, accusations, of, food, and, sleep, deprivation, sexual, and, physical, abuse, and, excesses, of, spiritual, and, emotional, authority, by, the, charismatic, leader, michael, langone, argues, that, some, will, accept, uncritically, the, positive, reports, of, current, members, without, calling, such, reports, for, example, benevolence, tales, or, personal, growth, tales, he, asserts, that, only, the, critical, reports, of, ex, members, are, called, tales, which, he, considers, to, be, a, term, that, clearly, implies, falsehood, or, fiction, he, states, that, it, wasn, t, until, 1996, that, a, researcher, conducted, a, study, to, assess, the, extent, to, which, so, called, atrocity, tales, might, be, based, on, fact, apostasy, is, a, criminal, offence, in, the, following, countries, from, 1985, to, 2006, the, united, states, commission, on, international, religious, freedom, listed, a, total, of, four, cases, of, execution, for, apostasy, in, the, muslim, world, one, in, sudan, 1985, two, in, iran, 1989, 1998, and, one, in, saudi, arabia, 1992, both, marginal, and, apostate, bah, s, have, existed, in, the, bah, faith, community, who, are, known, as, n, qe, n, muslims, often, regard, adherents, of, the, bah, faith, as, apostates, from, islam, and, there, have, been, cases, in, some, muslim, countries, where, bah, s, have, been, harassed, and, persecuted, the, christian, understanding, of, apostasy, is, a, willful, falling, away, from, or, rebellion, against, christian, truth, apostasy, is, the, rejection, of, christ, by, one, who, has, been, a, christian, but, the, reformed, churches, teach, that, in, contrast, to, the, conditional, salvation, of, lutheran, roman, catholic, methodist, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, theology, salvation, cannot, be, lost, once, accepted, perseverance, of, the, saints, apostasy, is, the, antonym, of, conversion, it, is, deconversion, b, j, oropeza, states, that, apostasy, is, a, phenomenon, that, occurs, when, a, religious, follower, or, group, of, followers, turn, away, from, or, otherwise, repudiate, the, central, beliefs, and, practices, they, once, embraced, in, a, respective, religious, community, the, ancient, greek, noun, apostasia, rebellion, abandonment, state, of, apostasy, defection, is, found, only, twice, in, the, new, testament, acts, 21, 21, 2, thessalonians, 2, 3, however, the, concept, of, apostasy, is, found, throughout, scripture, the, dictionary, of, biblical, imagery, states, that, there, are, at, least, four, distinct, images, in, scripture, of, the, concept, of, apostasy, all, connote, an, intentional, defection, from, the, faith, these, images, are, rebellion, turning, away, falling, away, adultery, speaking, with, specific, regard, to, apostasy, in, christianity, michael, fink, writes, apostasy, is, certainly, a, biblical, concept, but, the, implications, of, the, teaching, have, been, hotly, debated, the, debate, has, centered, on, the, issue, of, apostasy, and, salvation, based, on, the, concept, of, god, s, sovereign, grace, some, hold, that, though, true, believers, may, stray, they, never, totally, fall, away, others, affirm, that, any, who, fall, away, were, never, really, saved, though, they, may, have, believed, for, a, while, they, never, experienced, regeneration, still, others, argue, that, the, biblical, warnings, against, apostasy, are, real, and, that, believers, maintain, the, freedom, at, least, potentially, to, reject, god, s, salvation, in, the, recent, past, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, word, was, also, applied, to, the, renunciation, of, monastic, vows, apostasis, a, monachatu, and, to, the, abandonment, of, the, clerical, profession, for, the, life, of, the, world, apostasis, a, clericatu, without, necessarily, amounting, to, a, rejection, of, christianity, apostasy, was, one, of, the, sins, for, which, the, early, church, imposed, perpetual, penance, and, excommunication, christianity, rejected, the, removal, of, heretics, and, apostates, by, force, leaving, the, final, punishment, to, god, as, a,

schism, apostasy, a, fide, defined, as, total, repudiation, of, the, christian, faith, was, considered, as, different, from, a, theological, standpoint, from, heresy, but, subject, to, the, same, penalty, of, death, by, fire, by, decretist, jurists, the, influential, 13th, century, theologian, hostiensis, recognized, three, types, of, apostasy, the, first, was, conversion, to, another, faith, which, was, considered, traitorous, and, could, bring, confiscation, of, property, or, even, the, death, penalty, the, second, and, third, which, was, punishable, by, expulsion, from, home, and, imprisonment, consisted, of, breaking, major, commandments, and, breaking, the, vows, of, religious, orders, respectively, a, decretal, by, boniface, viii, classified, apostates, together, with,

the, distinction, between, the, apostate, narrative, and, the, role, of, the, apostate, asserting, that, the, former, follows, a, predictable, pattern, in, which, the, apostate, uses, a, captivity,

are, likened, to, pow, camps, and, deprogramming, as, heroic, hostage, rescue, efforts, he, also, makes, a, distinction, between, leavetakers, and, apostates, asserting, that, despite, the, popular, literature, and, lurid, media, accounts, of, stories, of, rescued, or, recovering, ex, cultists, empirical, studies, of, defectors, from, nrms, generally, indicate, favorable, sympathetic, or, at,

to, a, logical, relationship, between, apostates, and, whistleblowers, using, bromley, s, definitions, in, which, the, former, predates, the, latter, a, person, becomes, an, apostate, and, then, seeks, the, role, of, whistleblower, which, is, then, rewarded, for, playing, that, role, by, groups, that, are, in, conflict, with, the, original, group, of, membership, such, as, anti, cult, organizations, these, organizations, further, cultivate, the, apostate, seeking, to, turn, him, or, her, into, a, whistleblower, he, also, describes, how, in, this, context, apostates, accusations, of, brainwashing, are, designed, to, attract, perceptions, of, threats, against, the, well, being, of, young, adults, on, the, part, of, their, families, to, further, establish, their, newfound, role,
