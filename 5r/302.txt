prehistoric, religion, is, the, religious, practice, of, prehistoric, cultures, prehistory, the, period, before, written, records, makes, up, the, bulk, of, human, experience, over, 99, of, human, experience, occurred, during, the, paleolithic, period, alone, prehistoric, cultures, spanned, the, globe, and, existed, for, over, two, and, a, half, million, years, their, religious, practices, were, many, and, varied, and, the, study, of, them, is, difficult, due, to, the, lack, of, written, records, describing, the, details, of, their, faiths, the, cognitive, capacity, for, religion, likely, first, emerged, in, homo, sapiens, sapiens, or, anatomically, modern, humans, although, some, scholars, posit, the, existence, of, neanderthal, religion, and, sparse, evidence, exists, for, earlier, ritual, practice, excluding, sparse, and, controversial, evidence, in, the, middle, paleolithic, 300, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, religion, emerged, with, certainty, in, the, upper, paleolithic, around, 50, 000, years, ago, upper, paleolithic, religion, was, possibly, shamanic, oriented, around, the, phenomenon, of, special, spiritual, leaders, entering, trance, states, to, receive, esoteric, spiritual, knowledge, these, practices, are, extrapolated, based, on, the, rich, and, complex, body, of, art, left, behind, by, paleolithic, artists, particularly, the, elaborate, cave, art, and, enigmatic, venus, figurines, they, produced, the, neolithic, revolution, which, established, agriculture, as, the, dominant, lifestyle, occurred, around, 12, 000, bc, and, ushered, in, the, neolithic, neolithic, society, grew, hierarchical, and, inegalitarian, compared, to, its, paleolithic, forebears, and, their, religious, practices, likely, changed, to, suit, neolithic, religion, may, have, become, more, structural, and, centralised, than, in, the, paleolithic, and, possibly, engaged, in, ancestor, worship, both, of, one, s, individual, ancestors, and, of, the, ancestors, of, entire, groups, tribes, and, settlements, one, famous, feature, of, neolithic, religion, were, the, stone, circles, of, the, british, isles, of, which, the, best, known, today, is, stonehenge, a, particularly, well, known, area, of, late, neolithic, through, chalcolithic, religion, is, proto, indo, european, mythology, the, religion, of, the, people, who, first, spoke, the, proto, indo, european, language, which, has, been, partially, reconstructed, through, shared, religious, elements, between, early, indo, european, language, speakers, bronze, age, and, iron, age, religions, are, understood, in, part, through, archaeological, records, but, also, more, so, than, paleolithic, and, neolithic, through, written, records, some, societies, had, writing, in, these, ages, and, were, able, to, describe, those, which, did, not, these, eras, of, prehistoric, religion, see, particular, cultural, focus, today, by, modern, reconstructionists, with, many, pagan, faiths, today, based, on, the, pre, christian, practices, of, protohistoric, bronze, and, iron, age, societies, prehistory, is, the, period, in, human, history, before, written, records, the, lack, of, written, evidence, demands, the, use, of, archaeological, evidence, which, makes, it, difficult, to, extrapolate, conclusive, statements, about, religious, belief, much, of, the, study, of, prehistoric, religion, is, based, on, inferences, from, historic, textual, and, ethnographic, evidence, for, example, analogies, between, the, religion, of, palaeolithic, and, modern, hunter, gatherer, societies, the, usefulness, of, analogy, in, archaeological, reasoning, is, theoretically, complex, and, contested, but, in, the, context, of, prehistoric, religion, can, be, strengthened, by, circumstantial, evidence, for, instance, it, has, been, observed, that, red, ochre, was, significant, to, many, prehistoric, societies, and, to, modern, hunter, gatherers, religion, exists, in, all, known, human, societies, but, the, study, of, prehistoric, religion, was, only, popularised, around, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, a, founder, effect, in, prehistoric, archaeology, a, field, pioneered, by, nineteenth, century, secular, humanists, who, found, religion, a, threat, to, their, evolution, based, field, of, study, may, have, impeded, the, early, attribution, of, a, religious, motive, to, prehistoric, humans, prehistoric, religion, differs, from, the, religious, format, known, to, most, twenty, first, century, commentators, based, around, orthodox, belief, and, scriptural, study, rather, prehistoric, religion, like, later, hunter, gatherer, religion, possibly, drew, from, shamanism, and, ecstatic, experience, as, well, as, animism, though, analyses, indicate, animism, may, have, emerged, earlier, though, the, nature, of, prehistoric, religion, is, so, speculative, the, evidence, left, in, the, archaeological, record, is, strongly, suggestive, of, a, visionary, framework, where, faith, is, practised, through, entering, trances, personal, experience, with, deities, and, other, hallmarks, of, shamanism, to, the, point, of, some, authors, suggesting, in, the, words, of, archaeologist, of, shamanism, neil, price, that, these, tendencies, and, techniques, are, in, some, way, hard, wired, into, the, human, mind, the, question, of, when, religion, emerged, in, the, evolving, psyche, has, sparked, the, curiosity, of, paleontologists, for, decades, on, the, whole, neither, the, archaeological, record, nor, the, current, understanding, of, how, human, intelligence, evolved, suggests, early, hominins, had, the, cognitive, capacity, for, spiritual, belief, religion, was, certainly, present, during, the, upper, paleolithic, period, dating, to, about, 50, 000, through, 12, 000, years, ago, while, religion, in, the, lower, and, middle, paleolithic, belongs, to, the, realm, of, legend, in, early, research, australopithecus, the, first, hominins, to, emerge, in, the, fossil, record, were, thought, to, have, sophisticated, hunting, patterns, these, hunting, patterns, were, extrapolated, from, those, of, modern, hunter, gatherers, and, in, turn, anthropologists, and, archaeologists, pattern, matched, australopithecus, and, peers, to, the, complex, ritual, surrounding, such, hunts, these, assumptions, were, later, disproved, and, evidence, suggesting, australopithecus, and, peers, were, capable, of, using, tools, such, as, fire, was, deemed, coincidental, for, several, decades, prehistoricist, consensus, has, opposed, the, idea, of, an, australopithecus, faith, the, first, evidence, of, ritual, emerges, in, the, hominin, genus, homo, which, emerged, between, 2, 3, million, years, ago, and, includes, modern, humans, their, ancestors, and, closest, relatives, the, exact, question, of, when, ritual, shaded, into, religious, faith, evades, simple, answer, the, lower, and, middle, paleolithic, periods, dominated, by, early, homo, hominins, were, an, extraordinarily, long, period, from, the, emergence, of, homo, until, 50, 000, years, before, the, present, of, apparent, cultural, stability, no, serious, evidence, for, religious, practice, exists, amongst, homo, habilis, the, first, hominin, to, use, tools, the, picture, complicates, as, homo, erectus, emerges, h, erectus, was, the, point, where, hominins, seem, to, have, developed, an, appreciation, for, ritual, the, intellectual, ability, to, stem, aggression, of, the, kind, seen, in, modern, chimpanzees, and, a, sense, of, moral, responsibility, though, the, emergence, of, ritual, in, h, erectus, should, not, be, understood, as, the, full, flowering, of, religious, capacity, it, marked, a, qualitative, and, quantitative, change, to, its, forebears, an, area, of, particular, scholarly, interest, is, the, evidence, base, for, cannibalism, and, ritual, mutilation, amongst, h, erectus, skulls, found, in, java, and, at, the, chinese, zhoukoudian, archaeological, site, bear, evidence, of, tampering, with, the, brain, case, of, the, skull, in, ways, thought, to, correspond, to, removing, the, brain, for, cannibalistic, purposes, as, observed, in, hunter, gatherers, perhaps, more, tellingly, in, those, sites, and, others, a, number, of, h, erectus, skulls, show, signs, suggesting, that, the, skin, and, flesh, was, cut, away, from, the, skull, in, predetermined, patterns, these, patterns, unlikely, to, occur, by, coincidence, are, associated, in, turn, with, ritual, the, lineage, leading, to, anatomically, modern, humans, originated, around, 500, 000, years, before, the, present, day, modern, humans, are, classified, taxonomically, as, homo, sapiens, sapiens, this, classification, is, controversial, as, it, goes, against, traditional, subspecies, classifications, no, other, hominins, have, been, treated, as, uncontroversial, members, of, h, sapiens, the, 2003, description, of, homo, sapiens, idaltu, drew, attention, as, a, relatively, clear, case, of, a, h, sapiens, subspecies, but, was, disputed, by, authors, such, as, chris, stringer, neanderthals, in, particular, pose, a, taxonomic, problem, the, classification, of, neanderthals, a, close, relative, of, anatomically, modern, humans, as, homo, neanderthalensis, or, homo, sapiens, neanderthalensis, is, a, decades, long, matter, of, dispute, neanderthals, and, h, s, sapiens, were, able, to, interbreed, a, trait, associated, with, membership, in, the, same, species, and, around, 2, of, the, modern, human, genome, is, composed, of, neanderthal, dna, however, strong, negative, selection, existed, against, the, direct, offspring, of, neanderthals, and, h, s, sapiens, consistent, with, the, reduced, fertility, seen, in, hybrid, species, such, as, mules, this, has, been, used, as, recent, argument, against, the, classification, of, neanderthals, as, a, h, sapiens, subspecies, the, study, of, neanderthal, ritual, as, proxy, and, preface, for, religion, revolves, around, death, and, burial, rites, the, first, undisputed, burials, approximately, 150, 000, years, ago, were, performed, by, neanderthals, the, limits, of, the, archaeological, record, stymie, extrapolation, from, burial, to, funeral, rites, though, evidence, of, grave, goods, and, unusual, markings, on, bones, suggest, funerary, practices, in, addition, to, funerals, a, growing, evidence, base, suggests, neanderthals, made, use, of, bodily, ornamentation, through, pigments, feathers, and, even, claws, as, such, ornamentation, is, not, preserved, in, the, archaeological, record, it, is, understood, only, by, comparison, to, modern, hunter, gatherers, where, it, often, corresponds, to, rituals, of, spiritual, significance, unlike, h, s, sapiens, over, equivalent, periods, neanderthal, society, as, preserved, in, the, archaeological, record, is, one, of, remarkable, stability, with, little, change, in, tool, design, over, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, neanderthal, cognition, as, backfilled, from, genetic, and, skeletal, evidence, is, thought, rigid, and, simplistic, compared, to, that, of, contemporary, let, alone, modern, h, s, sapiens, by, extension, neanderthal, ritual, is, speculated, to, have, been, a, teaching, mechanism, that, resulted, in, an, unchanging, culture, by, embedding, a, learning, style, where, orthopraxy, dominated, in, thought, life, and, culture, this, is, contrasted, with, prehistoric, h, s, sapiens, religious, ritual, which, is, understood, as, an, extension, of, art, culture, and, intellectual, curiosity, archaeologists, such, as, brian, hayden, interpret, neanderthal, burial, as, suggestive, of, both, belief, in, an, afterlife, and, of, ancestor, worship, hayden, also, interprets, neanderthals, as, engaging, in, bear, worship, a, hypothesis, driven, by, the, common, finding, of, cave, bear, remains, around, neanderthal, habitats, and, by, the, frequency, of, such, worship, amongst, cold, dwelling, hunter, gatherer, societies, cave, excavations, throughout, the, twentieth, century, found, copious, bear, remains, in, and, around, neanderthal, habitats, including, stacked, skulls, bear, bones, around, human, graves, and, patterns, of, skeletal, remains, consistent, with, animal, skin, displays, other, archaeologists, such, as, ina, wunn, find, the, evidence, for, the, bear, cult, unconvincing, wunn, interprets, neanderthals, as, a, pre, religious, people, and, the, presence, of, bear, remains, around, neanderthal, habitats, as, a, coincidental, association, as, cave, bears, by, their, nature, dwell, in, caves, their, bones, should, be, expected, to, be, found, there, the, broader, archaeological, evidence, overall, suggests, that, bear, worship, was, not, a, major, factor, of, paleolithic, religion, in, recent, years, genetic, and, neurological, research, has, expanded, the, study, of, the, emergence, of, religion, in, 2018, the, cultural, anthropologist, margaret, boone, rappaport, published, her, analysis, of, the, sensory, neurological, and, genetic, differences, between, the, great, apes, neanderthals, h, s, sapiens, and, h, s, idaltu, she, interprets, the, h, s, sapiens, brain, and, genome, as, having, a, unique, capacity, for, religion, through, characteristics, such, as, expanded, parietal, lobes, greater, cognitive, flexibility, and, an, unusually, broad, capacity, for, both, altruism, and, aggression, in, rappaport, s, framework, only, h, s, sapiens, of, the, hominins, is, capable, of, religion, for, much, the, same, reason, as, the, tools, and, artworks, of, prehistoric, h, s, sapiens, are, finer, and, more, detailed, than, those, of, their, neanderthal, contemporaries, all, are, products, of, a, unique, cognition, the, paleolithic, sometimes, called, the, old, stone, age, makes, up, over, 99, of, humanity, s, history, lasting, from, approximately, 2, 5, million, years, ago, through, to, 10, 000, bc, the, paleolithic, comprises, the, emergence, of, the, homo, genus, the, evolution, of, mankind, and, the, emergence, of, art, technology, and, culture, the, paleolithic, is, broadly, divided, into, lower, middle, and, upper, periods, the, lower, paleolithic, 2, 5, mya, 300, 000, bc, sees, the, emergence, of, stone, tools, the, evolution, of, australopithecus, homo, habilis, and, homo, erectus, and, the, first, dispersal, of, humanity, from, africa, the, middle, paleolithic, 300, 000, bc, 50, 000, bc, the, apparent, beginnings, of, culture, and, art, alongside, the, emergence, of, neanderthals, and, anatomically, modern, humans, the, upper, paleolithic, 50, 000, bc, 10, 000, bc, a, sharp, flourishing, of, culture, the, emergence, of, sophisticated, and, elaborate, art, jewellery, and, clothing, and, the, worldwide, dispersal, of, homo, sapiens, sapiens, religion, prior, to, the, upper, paleolithic, is, speculative, and, the, lower, paleolithic, in, particular, has, no, clear, evidence, of, religious, practice, not, even, the, loosest, evidence, for, ritual, exists, prior, to, 500, 000, years, before, the, present, though, archaeologist, gregory, j, wightman, notes, the, limits, of, the, archaeological, record, means, their, practice, cannot, be, thoroughly, ruled, out, the, early, hominins, of, the, lower, paleolithic, an, era, well, before, the, emergence, of, h, s, sapiens, slowly, gained, as, they, began, to, collaborate, and, work, in, groups, the, ability, to, control, and, mediate, their, emotional, responses, their, rudimentary, sense, of, collaborative, identity, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, later, social, aspects, of, religion, australopithecus, the, first, hominins, were, a, pre, religious, people, though, twentieth, century, historian, of, religion, mircea, eliade, felt, that, even, this, earliest, branch, on, the, human, evolutionary, line, had, a, certain, spiritual, awareness, the, twenty, first, century, s, understanding, of, australopithecene, cognition, does, not, permit, the, level, of, abstraction, necessary, for, spiritual, experience, for, all, that, the, hominins, of, the, lower, paleolithic, are, read, as, incapable, of, spirituality, some, writers, read, the, traces, of, their, behaviour, such, as, to, permit, an, understanding, of, ritual, even, as, early, as, australopithecus, durham, university, professor, of, archaeology, paul, pettitt, reads, the, al, 333, fossils, a, group, of, australopithecus, afarensis, found, together, near, hadar, ethiopia, as, perhaps, deliberately, moved, to, the, area, as, a, mortuary, practice, later, lower, paleolithic, remains, have, also, been, interpreted, as, bearing, associations, of, funerary, rites, particularly, cannibalism, though, archaeologist, kit, w, wesler, states, there, is, no, evidence, in, the, lower, paleolithic, of, the, kind, of, cultural, elaboration, that, would, imply, a, rich, imagination, or, the, level, of, intelligence, of, modern, humans, he, discusses, the, findings, of, homo, heidelbergensis, bones, at, sima, de, los, huesos, and, the, evidence, stretching, from, germany, to, china, for, cannibal, practices, amongst, lower, paleolithic, humans, a, number, of, skulls, found, in, archaeological, excavations, of, lower, paleolithic, sites, across, diverse, regions, have, had, significant, proportions, of, the, brain, cases, broken, away, writers, such, as, hayden, speculate, that, this, marks, cannibalistic, tendencies, of, religious, significance, hayden, deeming, cannibalism, the, most, parsimonious, explanation, compares, the, behaviour, to, hunter, gatherer, tribes, described, in, written, records, to, whom, brain, eating, bore, spiritual, significance, by, extension, he, reads, the, skull, s, damage, as, evidence, of, lower, paleolithic, ritual, practice, for, the, opposite, position, wunn, finds, the, cannibalism, hypothesis, bereft, of, factual, backing, she, interprets, the, patterns, of, skull, damage, as, a, matter, of, what, skeletal, parts, are, more, or, less, preserved, over, the, course, of, thousands, or, millions, of, years, even, within, the, cannibalism, framework, she, argues, that, the, practice, would, be, more, comparable, to, brain, eating, in, chimpanzees, than, in, hunter, gatherers, in, the, 2010s, the, study, of, paleolithic, cannibalism, grew, more, complex, due, to, new, methods, of, archaeological, interpretation, which, led, to, the, conclusion, much, paleolithic, cannibalism, was, for, nutritional, rather, than, ritual, reasons, in, the, upper, paleolithic, religion, is, associated, with, symbolism, and, sculpture, one, upper, paleolithic, remnant, that, draws, cultural, attention, are, the, venus, figurines, carved, statues, of, nude, women, speculated, to, represent, deities, fertility, symbols, or, ritual, fetish, objects, archaeologists, have, proposed, the, existence, of, lower, paleolithic, venus, figurines, the, venus, of, berekhat, ram, is, one, such, highly, speculative, figure, a, scoria, dated, 300, 350, thousand, years, ago, with, several, grooves, interpreted, as, resembling, a, woman, s, torso, and, head, scanning, electron, microscopy, found, the, venus, of, berekhat, ram, s, grooves, consistent, with, those, that, would, be, produced, by, contemporary, flint, tools, pettitt, argues, that, though, the, figurine, can, hardly, be, described, as, artistically, achieved, it, and, other, speculative, venuses, of, the, lower, paleolithic, such, as, the, venus, of, tan, tan, demand, further, scrutiny, for, their, implications, for, contemporary, theology, these, figurines, were, possibly, produced, by, h, heidelbergensis, whose, brain, sizes, were, not, far, behind, those, of, neanderthals, and, h, s, sapiens, and, have, been, analysed, for, their, implications, for, the, artistic, understanding, of, such, early, hominins, the, tail, end, of, the, lower, paleolithic, saw, a, cognitive, and, cultural, shift, the, emergence, of, revolutionary, technologies, such, as, fire, coupled, with, the, course, of, human, evolution, extending, development, to, include, a, true, childhood, and, improved, bonding, between, mother, and, infant, perhaps, broke, new, ground, in, cultural, terms, it, is, in, the, last, few, hundred, thousand, years, of, the, period, that, the, archaeological, record, begins, to, demonstrate, hominins, as, creatures, that, influence, their, environment, as, much, as, they, are, influenced, by, it, later, lower, paleolithic, hominins, built, wind, shelters, to, protect, themselves, from, the, elements, they, collected, unusual, natural, objects, they, began, the, use, of, pigments, such, as, red, ochre, these, shifts, do, not, coincide, with, species, level, evolutionary, leaps, being, observed, in, both, h, heidelbergensis, and, h, erectus, different, authors, interpret, these, shifts, with, different, levels, of, skepticism, some, seeing, them, as, a, spiritual, revolution, and, others, as, simply, the, beginning, of, the, beginning, while, the, full, significance, of, these, changes, is, difficult, to, discern, they, clearly, map, to, an, advance, in, cognitive, capacity, in, the, directions, that, would, eventually, lead, to, religion, the, middle, paleolithic, was, the, era, of, coterminous, neanderthal, and, h, s, sapiens, anatomically, modern, human, habitation, h, s, sapiens, originated, in, africa, and, neanderthals, in, eurasia, over, the, course, of, the, period, h, s, sapiens, range, expanded, to, areas, formerly, dominated, by, neanderthals, eventually, supplanting, them, and, ushering, in, the, upper, paleolithic, much, is, unknown, about, neanderthal, cognition, particularly, the, capacities, that, would, give, rise, to, religion, religious, interpretations, of, neanderthals, have, discussed, their, possibly, ritual, use, of, caves, their, burial, practices, and, religious, practices, amongst, h, s, sapiens, hunter, gatherer, tribes, in, recorded, history, considered, to, have, similar, lifestyles, to, neanderthals, pre, religious, interpretations, of, neanderthals, argue, their, archaeological, record, suggests, a, lack, of, creativity, or, supernatural, comprehension, that, neanderthal, associated, archaeological, findings, are, too, quickly, ascribed, religious, motive, and, that, the, genetic, and, neurological, remnants, of, neanderthal, skeletons, do, not, permit, the, cognitive, complexity, required, for, religion, while, the, neanderthals, dominated, europe, middle, paleolithic, h, s, sapiens, ruled, africa, middle, paleolithic, h, s, sapiens, like, its, neanderthal, contemporaries, bears, little, obvious, trace, of, religious, practice, the, art, tools, and, stylistic, practice, of, the, era, s, h, s, sapiens, are, not, suggestive, of, the, complexity, necessary, for, spiritual, belief, and, practice, however, the, middle, paleolithic, is, long, and, the, h, s, sapiens, who, lived, in, it, heterogeneous, models, of, behavioural, modernity, disagree, on, how, humanity, became, behaviourally, and, cognitively, sophisticated, whether, as, a, sudden, emergence, in, the, upper, paleolithic, or, a, slow, process, over, the, last, hundred, thousand, years, of, the, middle, paleolithic, supporters, of, the, second, hypothesis, point, to, evidence, of, increasing, cultural, ritual, and, spiritual, sophistication, 150, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, neanderthals, were, the, earliest, hominins, to, bury, their, dead, although, not, the, chronologically, first, burials, as, earlier, burials, such, as, those, of, the, skhul, and, qafzeh, hominins, are, recorded, amongst, early, h, s, sapiens, though, relatively, few, neanderthal, burials, are, known, spaced, thousands, of, years, apart, over, broad, geographical, ranges, hayden, argues, them, undeniable, hallmarks, of, spiritual, recognition, and, clear, indications, of, concepts, of, the, afterlife, though, pettitt, is, more, cautious, about, the, significance, of, neanderthal, burial, he, deems, it, a, sophisticated, and, more, than, prosaic, practice, pettitt, deems, the, neanderthals, of, at, least, southwest, france, germany, and, the, levant, possessive, of, clear, mortuary, rites, he, presumes, linked, to, an, underlying, belief, system, he, calls, particular, attention, to, potential, grave, markers, found, around, neanderthal, burials, particularly, those, of, children, at, la, ferrassie, in, dordogne, one, matter, discussed, in, the, context, of, neanderthal, burial, is, grave, goods, objects, placed, in, graves, that, are, frequently, seen, in, early, religious, cultures, outside, of, the, controversial, shanidar, iv, flower, burial, now, considered, coincidence, neanderthals, are, not, seen, to, bury, their, dead, with, grave, goods, however, a, burial, of, an, adult, and, child, of, the, kizil, koba, culture, was, accompanied, by, a, flint, stone, with, markings, in, 2018, a, team, at, the, french, national, centre, for, scientific, research, published, their, analysis, that, the, markings, were, intentionally, made, and, possibly, held, symbolic, significance, the, archaeological, record, preserves, neanderthal, associations, with, red, pigments, and, quartz, crystals, hayden, states, it, is, inconceivable, to, me, that, early, hunting, and, gathering, groups, would, have, been, painting, images, or, decorating, their, bodies, without, some, kind, of, symbolic, or, religious, framework, for, such, activities, he, draws, comparison, to, the, use, of, red, ochre, amongst, those, modern, hunter, gatherers, to, whom, it, represents, a, sacred, colour, he, similarly, connects, quartz, collection, to, religious, use, of, crystals, in, later, shamanic, practice, not, all, writers, are, as, convinced, that, this, represents, underlying, spiritual, experience, to, mark, nielsen, evidence, of, ritual, practice, amongst, neanderthals, does, not, represent, religion, he, interprets, their, cultural, remnants, such, as, the, rare, cave, art, they, produced, as, insufficiently, sophisticated, for, such, comprehension, rather, neanderthal, orthopraxy, is, a, cultural, teaching, mechanism, that, permitted, their, unusually, stable, culture, existing, at, the, same, technological, level, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, during, rapid, h, s, sapiens, change, to, nielsen, neanderthal, ritual, is, how, they, preserved, an, intractable, culture, via, teachings, passed, down, through, generations, ultimately, neanderthal, religion, is, speculative, and, hard, evidence, for, religious, practice, exists, only, amongst, upper, paleolithic, h, s, sapiens, though, hayden, and, to, some, degree, pettitt, take, a, spiritualised, interpretation, of, neanderthal, culture, these, interpretations, are, unclear, at, best, as, pettitt, says, the, very, real, possibility, exists, that, religion, sensu, stricto, is, a, unique, characteristic, of, symbolically, and, linguistically, empowered, homo, sapiens, other, writers, such, as, wunn, find, the, concept, of, neanderthal, religion, mere, speculation, that, at, best, is, an, optimistic, interpretation, of, the, archaeological, record, what, ritual, neanderthals, had, rather, than, supernatural, is, oft, interpreted, as, a, mechanism, of, teaching, and, social, bonding, matt, j, rossano, defining, neanderthal, practice, as, proto, religion, compares, it, to, purely, mimetic, community, activities, such, as, marching,

the, bones, of, other, birds, they, then, proposed, some, cult, of, the, sun, bird, where, the, golden, eagle, was, a, symbol, of, power, h, s, sapiens, emerged, in, africa, as, early, as, 300, 000, years, ago, in, the, middle, paleolithic, particularly, its, first, couple, hundred, thousand, years, the, archaeological, record, of, h, s, sapiens, is, barely, distinguishable, from, their, neanderthal, and, h, heidelbergensis, contemporaries, though, these, first, h, s, sapiens, demonstrated, some, ability, to, construct, shelter, use, pigments, and, collect, artifacts, they, yet, lacked, the, behavioural, sophistication, associated, with, humans, today, the, process, through, which, h, s, sapiens, became, cognitively, and, culturally, sophisticated, is, known, as, behavioural, modernity, the, emergence, of, behavioural, modernity, is, unclear, traditionally, conceptualised, as, a, sudden, shock, around, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, modern, accounts, more, often, understand, it, as, a, slow, process, throughout, the, late, middle, paleolithic, where, behavioural, modernity, is, conceptualised, as, originating, in, the, middle, paleolithic, some, authors, also, push, back, the, traditional, framework, of, religion, s, origin, to, account, for, it, wightman, discusses, wonderwerk, cave, in, south, africa, inhabited, 180, 000, years, ago, by, early, h, s, sapiens, and, filled, with, unusual, objects, such, as, quartz, crystals, and, inscribed, stones, he, argues, these, may, have, been, ritual, artifacts, that, served, as, foci, for, rites, performed, by, these, early, humans, wightman, is, even, more, enraptured, by, the, botswanan, tsodilo, sacred, to, modern, hunter, gatherers, which, primarily, houses, upper, paleolithic,

understand, as, spiritually, significant, and, wightman, hypothesises, this, sense, may, have, been, shared, by, their, earliest, forebears, he, is, also, curious, about, the, emergence, of, cave, art, towards, the, very, end, of, the, middle, paleolithic, where, drawings, and, traces, of, red, ochre, finally, emerge, 50, 000, years, ago, this, art, the, first, remnants, of, true, human, creativity, would, usher, in, the, upper, paleolithic, and, the, birth, of, complex, religion, the, emergence, of, the, upper, paleolithic, c, 40, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, was, a, time, of, explosive, development, the, upper, paleolithic, saw, the, worldwide, emergence, of, h, s, sapiens, as, the, sole, species, of, humanity, displacing, their, neanderthal, contemporaries, across, eurasia, and, travelling, to, previously, human, uninhabited, territories, such, as, australia, the, complexity, of, stone, tools, grew, and, the, production, of, complex, art, sculpture, and, decoration, began, long, distance, trade, networks, emerged, to, connect, communities, that, had, complex, house, like, habitations, and, food, storage, networks, true, religion, made, its, clear, emergence, during, this, period, of, flourishing, rossano, following, in, the, footsteps, of, other, authors, ascribes, this, to, shamanism, he, draws, a, line, between, pre, upper, paleolithic, social, bonding, rituals, and, faith, healing, where, the, latter, is, an, evolution, of, the, former, gesturing, at, the, universality, of, faith, healing, concepts, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, throughout, recorded, history, as, well, as, their, tendencies, to, involve, the, altered, states, of, consciousness, ascribed, to, shamanism, and, their, placebo, effect, on, psychologically, inspired, pain, he, conjectures, that, these, rituals, were, the, first, truly, supernatural, tendency, to, reveal, itself, to, the, human, psyche, price, refers, to, an, extension, of, this, as, the,

strong, basis, for, some, psychological, underpinning, to, shamanism, upper, paleolithic, humans, produced, complex, paintings, sculptures, and, other, artforms, much, of, which, held, apparent, ritual, significance, religious, interpretations, of, such, objects, especially, portable, art, such, as, figurines, varies, some, writers, understand, virtually, all, such, art, as, spiritual, while, others, read, only, a, minority, as, such, preferring, more, mundane, functions, for, the, majority, the, study, of, religious, art, in, the, upper, paleolithic, focuses, in, particular, on, cave, art, referred, to, alternatively, by, some, writers, such, as, david, s, whitley, as, rock, art, as, not, all, of, it, was, produced, on, cave, walls, rather, than, rock, formations, elsewhere, cave, art, is, frequently, conceptualised, as, a, tool, of, shamanism, this, model, the, mind, in, the, cave, conjecture, sees, much, cave, art, as, produced, in, altered, states, of, consciousness, as, a, tool, to, connect, the, artist, with, the, spirit, realm, visionary, cave, art, as, shamanic, art, is, referred, to, is, characterised, by, unnatural, imagery, such, as, animal, human, hybrids, and, by, recurring, themes, such, as, sex, death, flight, and, physical, transformation, not, all, religious, cave, art, depicts, shamanic, experience, cave, art, is, also, connected, by, analogy, with, modern, hunter, gatherers, to, initiation, rituals, a, painting, that, depicts, an, animal, to, most, members, of, a, tribe, may, have, a, deeper, symbolic, meaning, to, those, involved, in, smaller, secret, societies, comparative, evidence, for, this, form, of, cave, art, is, difficult, to, gather, as, secret, societies, by, definition, do, not, share, their, nature, with, outsider, anthropologists, in, some, cases, the, lifestyles, of, modern, hunter, gatherers, have, been, rendered, so, peripheral, as, to, lose, that, knowledge, entirely, nonetheless, these, arts, are, still, studied, and, general, ideas, can, still, be, concluded, concepts, associated, with, secret, society, cave, art, include, ancestor, figures, animals, as, metaphors, and, long, distance, travel, another, art, form, of, probable, religious, significance, are, the, venus, figurines, these, are, hand, held, statuettes, of, nude, women, found, in, upper, paleolithic, sites, across, eurasia, speculated, to, hold, significance, to, fertility, rites, though, separated, by, thousands, of, years, and, kilometres, venus, figurines, across, the, upper, paleolithic, share, consistent, features, they, focus, on, the, midsections, of, their, subjects, the, faces, are, blank, or, abstract, and, the, hands, and, feet, small, despite, the, near, nonexistence, of, obesity, amongst, hunter, gatherers, many, depict, realistically, rendered, obese, subjects, the, figures, are, universally, women, often, nude, and, frequently, pregnant, interpretations, of, venus, figurines, range, from, self, portraits, to, anti, climate, change, charms, to, matriarchal, representations, of, a, mother, goddess, hayden, argues, the, fertility, charm, interpretation, is, most, parsimonious, venus, figurines, are, often, found, alongside, other, apparent, fertility, objects, such, as, phallic, representations, and, that, secular, interpretations, in, particular, are, implausible, for, such, widespread, objects, he, similarly, disagrees, with, the, goddess, symbolism, as, seen, in, feminist, anthropology, on, the, basis, that, contemporary, hunter, gatherers, that, venerate, female, fertility, often, lack, actual, matriarchal, structures, indeed, in, more, recent, hunter, gatherer, societies, secret, societies, venerating, female, fertility, are, occasionally, restricted, to, men, contra, the, traditional, fertility, interpretation, patricia, c, rice, argues, nonetheless, that, the, venuses, are, symbols, of, women, throughout, their, lifetime, not, just, throughout, reproduction, and, that, they, represent, a, veneration, of, femaleness, and, femininity, as, a, whole, sculpture, more, broadly, is, a, significant, part, of, upper, paleolithic, art, and, often, analysed, for, its, spiritual, implications, upper, paleolithic, sculpture, is, frequently, seen, through, the, lenses, of, sympathetic, magic, and, ritual, healing, sculptures, found, in, siberia, have, been, analysed, through, such, an, understanding, by, comparison, to, more, recent, siberian, hunter, gatherers, who, made, figurines, while, ill, to, represent, and, ward, off, those, illnesses, venus, figurines, are, not, alone, in, terms, of, sexually, explicit, paleolithic, sculpture, around, a, hundred, phallic, representations, are, known, of, which, a, significant, proportion, are, circumcised, dating, the, origin, of, that, practice, to, the, era, sculptures, of, animals, are, also, recorded, as, are, sculptures, that, appear, to, be, part, human, and, part, animal, the, latter, especially, are, deemed, spiritually, significant, and, possibly, shamanistic, in, intent, representing, the, transformation, of, their, subjects, in, the, spirit, realm, other, interpretations, of, therianthropic, sculpture, include, ancestor, figures, totems, and, gods, though, fully, human, sculptures, in, the, upper, paleolithic, are, generally, female, those, with, mixed, human, and, animal, traits, are, near, universally, male, across, broad, geographic, and, chronological, ranges, the, upper, paleolithic, saw, the, advent, of, complex, burials, with, lavish, grave, goods, burials, seem, to, have, been, relatively, uncommon, in, these, societies, perhaps, reserved, for, people, of, high, social, or, religious, status, many, of, these, burials, seem, to, have, been, accompanied, by, large, quantities, of, red, ochre, but, the, matter, of, decomposition, makes, it, difficult, to, discern, whether, such, pigments, were, applied, to, flesh, or, bone, one, remarkable, case, of, a, pigmented, burial, is, that, of, lake, mungo, 3, in, inland, new, south, wales, australia, the, ochre, in, which, the, body, was, found, covered, must, have, been, transported, for, hundreds, of, kilometres, considering, the, distance, between, the, burial, and, the, nearest, sources, one, of, the, most, elaborate, upper, paleolithic, burials, known, is, that, of, sungir, 1, a, middle, aged, man, buried, at, the, russian, sungir, site, in, good, physical, health, at, the, time, of, his, death, sungir, 1, seems, to, have, been, killed, by, human, weaponry, an, incision, on, his, remains, matching, that, which, would, be, produced, by, contemporary, stone, blades, the, body, was, doused, in, ochre, particularly, around, the, head, and, neck, and, adorned, with, ivory, bead, jewellery, of, around, 3, 000, beads, twelve, fox, canine, teeth, surrounded, his, forehead, while, twenty, five, arm, bands, made, of, mammoth, ivory, were, worn, on, his, arms, and, a, single, pendant, made, of, stone, laid, on, his, chest, two, children, or, young, teenagers, were, additionally, interred, near, him, their, bodies, were, similarly, decorated, with, thousands, of, mammoth, ivory, beads, antlers, mammoth, shaped, ivory, carvings, and, ochre, covered, bones, of, other, humans, the, children, had, abnormal, skeletons, with, one, having, short, bowed, legs, and, the, other, an, unusual, facial, structure, burials, so, elaborate, clearly, suggest, some, concept, of, an, afterlife, and, are, similar, to, shaman, burials, in, cultures, described, in, written, records, burial, is, one, of, the, major, ways, archaeologists, understand, past, societies, in, the, words, of, timothy, taylor, there, can, be, no, clearer, a, priori, demonstration, of, ritual, in, past, societies, than, the, archaeological, uncovery, of, a, formal, human, burial, upper, paleolithic, burials, do, not, appear, to, represent, an, ordinary, cross, section, of, the, population, rather, their, subjects, are, unusual, and, extravagant, three, quarters, of, upper, paleolithic, burials, were, of, men, a, significant, proportion, young, or, disabled, and, many, buried, in, shared, tombs, they, are, frequently, posed, in, unusual, positions, and, buried, with, rich, grave, goods, taylor, supposes, many, of, these, dead, were, human, sacrifices, excluded, from, the, ordinary, means, of, body, disposal, he, presumes, cannibalism, and, warded, by, talismans, hayden, rather, speculates, these, were, shamans, or, otherwise, people, whose, religious, prominence, was, in, life, rather, than, death, he, notes, especially, the, frequency, of, physical, disability, comparing, it, to, the, many, shamans, in, recorded, societies, who, were, singled, out, for, physical, or, psychological, differences, upper, paleolithic, religions, were, presumably, polytheist, venerating, multiple, deities, as, this, form, of, religion, predates, monotheism, in, recorded, history, as, well, as, polytheism, religions, of, the, ancient, world, that, is, those, in, recorded, history, closest, chronologically, to, prehistoric, religion, focused, on, orthopraxy, or, a, focus, on, correct, practice, and, ritual, rather, than, orthodoxy, or, a, focus, on, correct, faith, and, belief, this, is, in, contrast, to, many, mainstream, modern, faiths, such, as, christianity, that, move, the, focus, to, orthodoxy, shamanism, may, have, been, a, major, part, of, upper, paleolithic, religion, shamanism, is, a, broad, term, referring, to, a, range, of, spiritual, experiences, practised, at, many, times, in, many, places, broadly, speaking, it, refers, to, spiritual, practice, involving, altered, states, of, consciousness, where, practitioners, render, themselves, in, ecstatic, or, extreme, psychological, states, in, order, to, commune, with, spirits, or, deities, the, study, of, prehistoric, shamanism, is, controversial, so, controversial, that, people, debating, each, side, of, the, argument, have, dubbed, their, interlocutors, shamaniacs, and, shamanophobes, the, shamanistic, interpretation, of, prehistoric, religion, is, based, in, the, neuropsychological, model, where, shamanic, experience, is, deemed, an, inherent, function, of, the, human, brain, the, symbols, associated, with, shamanic, art, such, as, animal, human, hybrid, figures, are, suggested, to, originate, from, certain, levels, of, trance, the, neuropsychological, model, has, been, criticised, opponents, refer, to, the, relative, rarity, of, some, forms, of, art, associated, with, it, to, tendencies, in, modern, shamanic, cultures, they, find, incompatible, with, it, and, to, the, work, of, pre, model, archaeologists, who, cautioned, against, shamanic, interpretations, a, popular, myth, about, prehistoric, religion, is, bear, worship, early, scholars, of, prehistory, finding, skeletons, of, the, extinct, cave, bear, around, paleolithic, habitats, drew, the, conclusion, humans, of, the, era, worshipped, or, otherwise, venerated, the, bears, the, concept, was, pioneered, by, excavations, in, the, late, 1910s, in, switzerland, where, apparent, deposits, of, cave, bear, bones, from, which, paleontologists, could, not, draw, obvious, function, were, interpreted, ritualistically, the, idea, was, debunked, as, early, as, the, 1970s, as, a, simple, artefact, of, sedimentary, deposits, changing, over, thousands, of, years, another, controversial, hypothesis, in, paleolithic, faith, is, that, it, was, oriented, around, goddess, worship, feminist, analyses, of, prehistoricism, interpret, findings, such, as, the, venus, figurines, as, suggestive, of, fully, realised, goddesses, marija, gimbutas, argued, that, as, evinced, by, eurasian, venus, figurines, the, predominant, deity, in, paleolithic, and, neolithic, religion, throughout, europe, was, a, goddess, with, later, subservient, male, deities, she, supposed, this, religion, was, wiped, out, by, steppe, invaders, later, in, the, neolithic, prior, to, the, beginning, of, the, historical, period, the, broad, geographic, range, of, venuses, has, also, seen, their, goddess, interpretation, in, other, regions, for, instance, bret, hinsch, proposes, a, line, of, descent, from, venuses, to, historical, chinese, goddess, worship, the, goddess, hypothesis, has, been, criticised, for, basis, in, a, limited, geographical, range, and, for, not, mapping, onto, similar, observations, seen, in, modern, hunter, gatherers, the, mesolithic, was, the, transitional, period, between, the, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, in, european, archaeology, it, traditionally, refers, to, hunter, gatherers, living, after, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, ice, age, traditional, archaeology, takes, a, quotidian, view, of, mesolithic, life, perceiving, it, as, an, era, of, cultural, impoverishment, without, great, cultural, artistic, or, societal, advances, the, lack, of, enthusiasm, to, study, the, neolithic, and, the, lack, of, encouragement, to, do, so, by, way, of, an, absence, of, interesting, archaeological, findings, tied, into, one, another, for, instance, no, mesolithic, cemeteries, were, unearthed, until, 1975, serious, study, of, mesolithic, religion, would, not, emerge, until, the, 21st, century, reinvigorating, the, field, and, reinterpreting, prior, assumptions, of, the, mesolithic, as, a, bleak, age, much, research, on, mesolithic, religion, centres, on, scandinavia, where, evidence, has, emerged, for, a, lifecycle, based, around, rites, of, passage, from, the, finding, of, places, that, may, have, been, dedicated, birthing, huts, it, appears, that, mesolithic, people, shared, the, assumption, of, some, more, modern, hunter, gatherers, that, birth, was, a, spiritually, dangerous, experience, and, that, heavily, pregnant, women, needed, to, be, secluded, from, society, for, the, wellbeing, of, both, parties, nonetheless, the, archaeological, findings, thought, to, have, been, birthing, huts, are, disputed, it, is, possible, their, spiritual, significance, was, broader, as, a, place, where, people, who, died, young, in, general, would, be, buried, separate, from, the, older, dead, later, in, life, anders, fischer, argues, for, the, existence, of, a, coming, of, age, ritual, amongst, males, perhaps, circumcision, connected, to, the, use, of, flint, blades, the, bulk, of, modern, understanding, of, mesolithic, religion, comes, from, burial, practices, mesolithic, scandinavian, burial, rites, are, relatively, well, reconstructed, the, dead, were, buried, with, grave, goods, notably, including, food, remnants, of, a, fish, stew, have, been, unearthed, from, some, graves, burial, practices, themselves, varied, heavily, bodies, might, be, buried, whole, or, partially, dismembered, before, burial, in, some, cases, animals, were, found, in, graves, alongside, humans, such, as, deer, pigs, and, cats, bodies, were, often, covered, in, ochre, the, context, of, mesolithic, burial, is, unclear, though, some, have, argued, these, burials, were, reserved, for, prestigious, individuals, others, think, just, the, opposite, noting, that, dedicated, cemeteries, in, the, era, overrepresent, the, very, young, the, very, old, and, young, women, who, may, have, died, in, childbirth, these, dead, are, traditionally, considered, more, liminal, than, the, average, person, and, their, burials, separate, from, the, community, may, have, marked, an, intentional, distancing, the, neolithic, was, the,

artifacts, with, apparent, spiritual, significance, sociologically, speaking, the, neolithic, saw, the, transition, from, nomadic, bands, to, sedentary, villages, this, decreased, the, egalitarianism, of, those, societies, that, transitioned, instead, of, more, loosely, collected, confederates, they, were, now, led, by, individuals, with, increasing, power, over, those, people, within, their,

for, good, harvests, and, threw, celebrations, in, the, harvest, season, the, neolithic, saw, the, emergence, of, a, spiritual, aristocracy, of, people, whose, societal, role, was, as, mages, missionaries, and, monarchs, in, the, neolithic, shamanism, was, increasingly, understood, as, the, domain, of, an, elite, rather, than, the, paleolithic, conceptualisation, where, a, relatively, broad, spectrum, of, society, may, be, able, to, practice, the, era, broadly, seems, to, have, heralded, the, beginning, of, sharp, social, stratification, as, understood, from, skeletal, and, archaeological, remains, particularly, in, its, heartland, of, the, near, east, the, neolithic, was, an, artistically, and, technologically, rich, era, the, rock, art, culturally, associated, with, the, paleolithic, did, not, disappear, in, the, neolithic, and, in, regions, like, south, india, it, indeed, flourished, well, into, the, era, as, well, as, continuing, old, forms, the, neolithic, permitted, the, emergence, of, new, kinds, of, art, and, design, as, people, moved, from, nomadic, to, sedentary, lifestyles, they, built, houses, that, represented, units, united, through, physical, structures, subsum, individuals, into, new, corporate, identities, they, also, built, megaliths, huge, stone, monuments, with, widely, speculated, theological, and, cultural, implications, though, a,

be, host, to, religious, activity, just, as, much, as, shrines, or, temples, one, of, the, most, famous, forms, of, neolithic, art, and, architecture, were, the, megalithic, stone, circles, of, western, europe, of, which, the, most, known, is, stonehenge, in, south, west, england, stone, circles, are, particularly, associated, with, the, british, isles, which, hosts, 1, 303, extant, circles, the, plurality, in, scotland, stone, circles, were, not, simple, constructions, but, built, through, complex, processes, where, the, stones, travelled, long, distances, to, their, foundations, parts, of, stonehenge, were, sourced, 250, kilometres, 160, mi, away, in, wales, this, technically, complex, construction, is, thought, a, herald, of, their, supernatural, power, to, the, people, who, built, them, the, preseli, hills, where, stonehenge, was, sourced, may, have, held, deep, significance, to, the, megalith, s, builders, though, the, exact, role, of, stone, circles, is, unclear, they, seem, to, have, been, in, part, or, whole, mausoleums, many, contain, skeletons, particularly, skulls, these, seem, to, track, to, ancestor, worship, and, in, particular, the, veneration, of, deceased, members, of, elite, spiritual, social, classes, stone, circles, also, appear, linked, to, cycles, of, the, sun, and, moon, stonehenge, for, instance, is, aligned, such, that, on, the, solstice, the,

beads, and, masks, sex, and, gender, play, roles, in, neolithic, burial, the, henan, burial, with, potential, sacrificial, victims, was, composed, of, three, men, and, one, woman, and, was, read, as, a, male, shaman, and, his, followers, other, neolithic, chinese, burials, of, people, interpreted, as, shamans, have, been, of, girls, and, women, such, as, two, girls, found, in, elaborate, tombs, at, a, site, in, shanxi, the, only, non, adults, in, that, burial, ground, sarah, milledge, nelson, wrote, that, burials, of, subjects, of, apparent, religious, importance, were, often, clouded, by, a, lack, of, clarity, as, to, the, subject, s, sex, because, of, the, difficulty, of, determining, sex, with, certainty, from, skeletal, remains, the, focal, decedent, in, the, richest, of, all, mesoamerican, burials, was, sexed, male, but, with, low, confidence, and, could, theoretically, have, been, a, woman, neolithic, burials, broadly, suggest, gender, inequality, with, women, having, fewer, grave, goods, and, poorer, diets, as, determined, from, their, skeletons, much, of, what, is, understood, about, neolithic, life, comes, from, individual, settlements, with, particularly, preserved, archaeological, records, such, as, atalh, y, k, in, southern, anatolia, atalh, y, k, was, settled, for, a, particularly, long, period, of, time, from, around, 7100, bc, to, 6000, bc, and, provides, a, snapshot, of, a, changing, era, residents, of, atalh, y, k, lived, in, shared, houses, with, non, relatives, drawing, their, closest, connections, to, practical, kin, rather, than, official, kin, they, seem, to, have, been, divided, into, two, sub, communities, going, by, different, dental, patterns, in, their, skeletal, remains, and, were, possibly, patrilocal, with, men, staying, in, the, community, of, their, birth, and, women, moving, away, nonetheless, atalh, y, k, is, not, in, all, ways, representative, of, neolithic, communities, most, such, communities, demonstrated, poor, nutrition, and, stunted, growth, but, the, people, of, atalh, y, k, appeared, to, have, adequate, nutrition, and, indeed, were, able, to, support, substantial, population, growth, from, these, preserved, settlements, archaeologists, try, to, extract, religious, practices, in, day, to, day, neolithic, life, in, ain, ghazal, mundane, archaeological, remains, coincide, with, striking, findings, such, as, caches, of, skulls, ceremonially, buried, statues, and, hundreds, of, clay, figurines, many, of, these, figurines, seem, to, have, been, fertility, and, birth, charms, birth, during, the, neolithic, was, the, most, dangerous, time, of, a, woman, s, life, and, spiritual, protection, against, maternal, death, of, the, utmost, importance, other, figurines, seem, to, have, been, used, as, pseudo, sacrifices, ritually, killed, and, buried, around, human, habitations, clay, figurines, broadly, have, been, found, in, many, neolithic, communities, and, the, individual, communities, that, made, them, are, extrapolated, based, on, their, features, sites, in, north, china, for, instance, find, a, paucity, of, figurines, of, humans, compared, to, those, of, animals, while, their, southern, peers, made, more, human, figurines, and, particularly, sexually, explicit, ones, it, is, often, unclear, exactly, what, role, such, figurines, held, to, the, societies, that, made, them, in, addition, to, religious, objects, they, may, have, held, more, mundane, functions, such, as, toys, or, even, been, both, at, once, the, theological, practices, of, people, in, early, state, societies, with, written, records, somewhat, later, than, the, neolithic, revolved, around, their, daily, lives, in, particular, these, societies, focused, on, the, growing, and, harvest, of, grains, and, their, religions, followed, they, worshipped, gods, of, grains, and, had, liturgical, calendars, revolving, around, the, harvest, early, agricultural, societies, also, suffered, high, rates, of, zoonotic, diseases, which, they, opposed, with, ritual, practice, sympathetic, magic, and, prayers, to, healing, deities, like, other, prehistoric, like, societies, described, in, written, records, these, experiences, may, be, comparable, to, those, of, neolithic, agriculturalists, people, in, the, neolithic, possibly, engaged, in, ancestor, worship, it, is, possible, that, inegalitarian, neolithic, societies, practised, two, separate, ancestor, cults, one, based, around, everyday, worship, of, the, ancestors, of, individual, families, and, one, based, around, ancestors, of, entire, tribes, settlements, or, cities, which, the, rulers, of, those, people, deemed, themselves, descended, from, in, bids, to, gain, spiritual, and, earthly, power, these, rulers, would, posit, themselves, the, heirs, of, gods, in, some, regions, evidence, also, exists, for, solar, worship, and, lunar, worship, for, instance, british, and, irish, stone, circles, are, generally, aligned, with, the, movement, of, the, sun, which, plausibly, played, a, role, in, their, ritual, significance, neolithic, religions, were, probably, heavily, ritual, based, these, rituals, would, have, signalled, membership, of, and, investment, in, the, communities, of, those, who, performed, them, these, communities, had, labour, and, health, expensive, initiation, rituals, consider, the, penile, subincision, performed, by, some, indigenous, australians, and, practising, them, marked, people, as, members, of, a, given, community, both, to, the, community, s, allies, and, to, its, enemies, even, if, they, were, later, to, try, to, strike, out, on, their, own, this, preserved, the, health, of, such, communities, their, members, developed, a, deep, identity, as, members, as, people, whose, fortunes, were, tied, to, the, broader, community, and, preferred, to, stay, rather, than, split, one, idea, associated, with, neolithic, religion, in, popular, culture, is, that, of, goddess, worship, some, fancifully, have, promoted, an, idealised, image, of, neolithic, society, as, a, matriarchal, theocracy, at, atalh, y, k, traditionally, considered, a, centre, of, goddess, worship, on, account, of, figurines, found, in, the, area, followers, of, new, religious, movements, would, take, pilgrimages, to, the, ruins, as, a, holy, site, the, sociologist, ayfer, bartu, candan, reported, seeing, a, woman, eat, a, handful, of, soil, from, the, ruins, in, front, of, the, mayor, of, the, nearby, town, of, umra, the, popularity, of, the, great, goddess, concept, of, neolithic, religion, can, be, traced, to, gimbutas, s, concept, of, a, peaceful, matriarchal, neolithic, where, a, goddess, was, worshipped, in, a, pan, european, religion, the, roots, of, the, concept, emerged, as, early, as, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, with, seminal, works, by, robert, graves, jacquetta, hawkes, and, o, g, s, crawford, pioneering, the, concept, however, the, idea, was, based, on, flawed, methodologies, and, conflation, of, different, movements, across, vast, geographical, areas, and, is, unlikely, to, be, representative, of, actual, neolithic, religious, practice, in, the, specific, case, of, atalh, y, k, the, primary, objects, of, worship, do, not, seem, to, have, been, human, deities, but, animal, ones, and, the, figurines, traditionally, interpreted, as, goddesses, were, possibly, anthropomorphic, bears, leopards, and, cattle, this, seems, to, be, reflective, of, a, broad, neolithic, tendency, towards, animal, worship, the, nearby, site, of, g, bekli, tepe, also, bears, significant, evidence, for, ritual, and, religious, significance, of, animals, the, xinglongwa, and, hongshan, cultures, of, northeastern, china, carved, elaborate, jade, sculptures, of, pigs, and, dragons, speculated, to, have, some, religious, role, china, was, one, of, the, first, major, sites, of, animal, domestication, and, domestic, animals, seem, to, have, played, wide, ranging, roles, in, neolithic, chinese, ritual, practice, in, particular, as, sacrificial, goods, for, high, ranking, spiritual, leaders, compared, to, the, paleolithic, shamanism, seems, to, have, become, more, peripheral, over, the, course, of, the, neolithic, in, many, regions, priests, of, increasingly, centralised, faiths, probably, took, over, isolated, shamanic, functions, although, shamanism, and, domestic, cults, of, personal, deities, clearly, continued, meanwhile, in, the, highly, stratified, societies, of, the, neolithic, elite, secret, societies, flourished, amongst, the, powerful, in, these, unequal, worlds, the, spiritually, powerful, were, able, to, manipulate, faith, to, convince, the, general, population, of, their, social, and, spiritual, subordinacy, the, chalcolithic, or, copper, age, was, the, transitional, period, between, the, neolithic, and, bronze, age, in, the, copper, age, an, early, understanding, of, metallurgy, permitted, the, formation, of, simple, copper, tools, to, supplement, stone, but, without, the, deliberate, production, of, its, improved, alloy, bronze, in, the, levant, the, copper, age, is, typified, by, social, agricultural, and, artistic, innovation, horticulture, of, plants, such, as, olives, became, a, major, complement, to, grain, agriculture, while, the, animal, products, available, to, farmers, diversified, settlements, expanded, and, came, to, inhabit, broader, geographical, ranges, while, the, art, and, textiles, of, the, area, made, great, strides, in, both, ornamental, capacities, and, symbolic, representation, this, contrasts, to, their, peers, in, egypt, and, mesopotamia, who, remained, somewhat, more, inhibited, throughout, the, era, further, west, and, especially, north, the, concept, of, the, copper, age, grows, controversial, the, british, chalcolithic, is, particularly, unclear, with, both, support, and, opposition, for, the, idea, that, copper, metallurgy, heralded, a, particular, era, in, british, prehistory, one, of, the, major, hypothesised, cultures, of, the, copper, age, were, the, proto, indo, europeans, from, whom, all, indo, european, language, and, mythology, may,

deities, such, as, a, possible, war, god, indo, europeanists, j, p, mallory, and, douglas, q, adams, are, skeptical, about, the, proto, indo, european, war, god, though, hayden, writing, from, a, more, generalist, perspective, supposes, its, existence, possibly, represented, as, a, bull, hayden, also, argues, for, entheogenic, rites, amongst, the, proto, indo, europeans, particularly, a,

protohistory, depends, on, the, individual, society, protohistoric, societies, have, not, developed, writing, but, have, been, described, in, written, records, of, societies, that, have, though, this, provides, more, evidence, for, their, cultures, and, practices, than, can, be, gleaned, by, archaeological, records, alone, it, poses, the, problem, that, the, only, lens, these, societies, are, understood, through, is, that, of, foreigners, who, may, dislike, mischaracterise, or, simply, misunderstand, the, people, they, write, about, in, north, africa, many, protohistoric, bronze, age, civilisations, are, known, from, description, by, the, egyptians, such, as, the, kerma, culture, of, what, is, now, sudan, the, maghrebinians, and, the, kingdom, of, punt, before, their, destruction,

paganism, and, celtic, paganism, traits, such, as, the, importance, of, bodies, of, water, recur, across, the, continent, but, the, oversimplification, of, this, vast, and, heterogeneous, body, of, religious, faith, into, a, single, religion, never, rises, above, simple, misconception, simultaneously, the, literary, records, of, these, faiths, clearly, miss, significant, aspects, of, their, practice, although, the, archaeological, record, for, iron, age, european, religion, is, so, dominated, by, the, deposition, of, statuettes, and, sculptures, into, water, this, goes, almost, completely, unrecorded, by, the, romans, eventually, the, romans, converted, to, christianity, and, set, to, introduce, their, new, faith, to, the, regions, under, their, sway, christianity, emerged, in, roman, britain, in, the, fourth, century, ad, and, the, religion, was, adopted, disproportionately, by, the, wealthy, residents, of, such, peripheral, regions, of, the, empire, after, decades, even, centuries, of, bloody, war, european, paganism, diminished, throughout, the, first, millennium, ad, and, the, final, sunset, of, the, faith, was, the, conversion, of, the, vikings, in, the, eleventh, century, new, religious, movements, such, as, neopaganism, take, theological, spiritual, and, cultural, positions, unlike, those, of, the, mainstream, religions, which, dominate, world, discourse, one, major, stream, of, neopaganism, is, reconstructionism, where, practitioners, attempt, to, reconstruct, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, long, lost, faiths, this, is, particularly, associated, with, the, prehistoric, and, protohistoric, cultures, of, the, european, bronze, and, iron, ages, major, groups, include, heathenry, which, focuses, on, the, reconstruction, of, germanic, and, particularly, norse, faiths, celtic, neopaganism, focusing, on, the, reconstruction, of, the, pre, christian, religions, of, the, celtic, people, and, neo, druidism, focusing, on, the, druids, popularly, associated, with, protohistoric, britain, an, array, of, minor, prehistoric, reconstructionist, movements, also, exist, such, as, proto, indo, european, reconstructionism, other, forms, of, reconstructionism, exist, working, from, a, more, new, age, perspective, such, as, neo, shamanism, the, western, reconstruction, of, shamanic, practice, pagan, positions, on, prehistoric, religion, proper, are, distinct, from, those, written, by, mainstream, authors, scholar, practitioner, michael, f, strmiska, writing, about, the, christianisation, of, protohistoric, societies, in, the, first, millennium, ad, criticises, the, common, perspective, of, the, rise, of, christianity, he, reinterprets, it, as, a, bloody, and, ruthless, war, where, christian, invaders, conquered, pagan, practitioners, and, suppressed, their, religious, practices, robert, j, wallis, neo, shaman, and, professor, of, visual, culture, at, richmond, university, analyses, the, academic, study, of, such, movements, he, argues, that, the, anthropological, practice, of, trying, to, observe, as, an, outsider, is, impossible, sitting, and, taking, notes, is, not, an, approved, role, in, neo, shamanic, practice, which, requires, either, being, at, the, centre, of, the, practice, or, being, absent, from, it, entirely, he, criticises, the, neglect, of, shamanism, reconstructed, or, otherwise, in, archaeology, as, a, consequence, of, a, lack, of, interest, in, the, form, of, introspective, theoretical, work, such, study, revolves, around, wallis, also, criticises, mainstream, archaeological, practice, as, potentially, offensive, to, reconstructionist, groups, such, as, the, excavation, of, bones, buried, in, stonehenge, the, degree, to, which, reconstructionism, focuses, on, european, ancestral, religions, is, a, matter, of, some, controversy, the, pagan, author, marisol, charbonneau, argues, european, pagan, reconstructionism, carries, notions, of, implicit, ethnic, and, cultural, allegiance, regardless, of, the, practitioner, s, thoughts, and, intent, she, in, part, ascribes, the, lack, of, communication, between, mostly, white, neopagan, practitioners, and, mostly, nonwhite, followers, of, recent, immigrant, spiritual, practices, to, this, implication, not, all, prehistoric, reconstructionism, is, centred, on, european, tradition, for, instance, neo, shamanism, is, generally, interpreted, as, having, a, specifically, non, western, background, heathenry, poses, particular, problems, for, this, issue, one, of, the, fastest, growing, religious, movements, in, northern, europe, and, elsewhere, practitioners, fear, it, being, co, opted, by, white, supremacist, movements, during, the, unite, the, right, rally, in, charlottesville, virginia, in, august, 2017, a, number, of, far, right, protestors, used, heathen, symbolism, alongside, imagery, such, as, nazi, and, confederate, flags, this, was, condemned, by, heathen, leaders, across, the, globe, who, were, dismayed, by, the, association, of, their, religion, with, these, movements, in, the, public, eye, wallis, sees, the, study, of, reconstructionism, from, the, opposite, angle, instead, of, scholar, practitioners, defending, their, religion, from, bad, faith, outside, attacks, he, focuses, on, the, phenomenon, of, outsiders, fearing, going, native, embedding, themselves, within, a, marginalised, spiritual, framework, and, receiving, the, ridicule, of, their, academic, peers, as, a, scholar, practitioner, himself, wallis, dismisses, this, concern, rather, his, concern, is, a, gap, between,
