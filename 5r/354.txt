that, the, cult, of, amun, first, developed, in, ancient, libya, before, spreading, to, ancient, egypt, amun, and, amaunet, are, mentioned, in, the, old, egyptian, pyramid, texts, the, name, amun, written, imn, meant, something, like, the, hidden, one, or, invisible, which, is, also, attested, by, epithets, found, in, the, pyramid, texts, o, you, the, great, god, whose, name, is, unknown, amun, rose, to, the, position, of, tutelary, deity, of, thebes, after, the, end, of, the, first, intermediate, period, under, the, 11th, dynasty, as, the, patron, of, thebes, his, spouse, was, mut, in, thebes, amun, as, father, mut, as, mother, and, the, moon, god, khonsu, as, their, son, formed, the, divine, family, or, the, theban, triad, the, history, of, amun, as, the, patron, god, of, thebes, begins, in, the, 20th, century, bc, with, the, construction, of, the, precinct, of, amun, re, at, karnak, under, senusret, i, the, city, of, thebes, does, not, appear, to, have, been, of, great, significance, before, the, 11th, dynasty, major, construction, work, in, the, precinct, of, amun, ra, took, place, during, the, 18th, dynasty, when, thebes, became, the, capital, of, the, unified, ancient, egypt, construction, of, the, hypostyle, hall, may, have, also, begun, during, the, 18th, dynasty, though, most, building, was, undertaken, under, seti, i, and, ramesses, ii, merenptah, commemorated, his, victories, over, the, sea, peoples, on, the, walls, of, the, cachette, court, the, start, of, the, processional, route, to, the, luxor, temple, this, great, inscription, which, has, now, lost, about, a, third, of, its, content, shows, the, king, s, campaigns, and, eventual, return, with, items, of, potential, value, and, prisoners, next, to, this, inscription, is, the, victory, stela, which, is, largely, a, copy, of, the, more, famous, merneptah, stele, found, in, the, funerary, complex, of, merenptah, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, in, thebes, merenptah, s, son, seti, ii, added, two, small, obelisks, in, front, of, the, second, pylon, and, a, triple, bark, shrine, to, the, north, of, the, processional, avenue, in, the, same, area, this, was, constructed, of, sandstone, with, a, chapel, to, amun, flanked, by, those, of, mut, and, khonsu, the, last, major, change, to, the, precinct, of, amun, re, s, layout, was, the, addition, of, the, first, pylon, and, the, massive, enclosure, walls, that, surrounded, the, whole, precinct, both, constructed, by, nectanebo, i, when, the, army, of, the, founder, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, expelled, the, hyksos, rulers, from, egypt, the, victor, s, city, of, origin, thebes, became, the, most, important, city, in, egypt, the, capital, of, a, new, dynasty, the, local, patron, deity, of, thebes, amun, therefore, became, nationally, important, the, pharaohs, of, that, new, dynasty, attributed, all, of, their, successes, to, amun, and, they, lavished, much, of, their, wealth, and, captured, spoil, on, the, construction, of, temples, dedicated, to, amun, the, victory, against, the, foreign, rulers, achieved, by, pharaohs, who, worshipped, amun, caused, him, to, be, seen, as, a, champion, of, the, less, fortunate, upholding, the, rights, of, justice, for, the, poor, by, aiding, those, who, traveled, in, his, name, he, became, the, protector, of, the, road, since, he, upheld, ma, at, truth, justice, and, goodness, those, who, prayed, to, amun, were, required, first, to, demonstrate, that, they, were, worthy, by, confessing, their, sins, votive, stelae, from, the, artisans, village, at, deir, el, medina, record, who, comes, at, the, voice, of, the, poor, in, distress, who, gives, breath, to, him, who, is, wretched, you, are, amun, the, lord, of, the, silent, who, comes, at, the, voice, of, the, poor, when, i, call, to, you, in, my, distress, you, come, and, rescue, me, though, the, servant, was, disposed, to, do, evil, the, lord, is, disposed, to, forgive, the, lord, of, thebes, spends, not, a, whole, day, in, anger, his, wrath, passes, in, a, moment, none, remains, his, breath, comes, back, to, us, in, mercy, may, your, ka, be, kind, may, you, forgive, it, shall, not, happen, again, subsequently, when, egypt, conquered, kush, they, identified, the, chief, deity, of, the, kushites, as, amun, this, kush, deity, was, depicted, as, ram, headed, more, specifically, a, woolly, ram, with, curved, horns, amun, thus, became, associated, with, the, ram, arising, from, the, aged, appearance, of, the, kush, ram, deity, and, depictions, related, to, amun, sometimes, had, small, ram, s, horns, known, as, the, horns, of, ammon, a, solar, deity, in, the, form, of, a, ram, can, be, traced, to, the, pre, literate, kerma, culture, in, nubia, contemporary, to, the, old, kingdom, of, egypt, the, later, meroitic, period, name, of, nubian, amun, was, amani, attested, in, numerous, personal, names, such, as, tanwetamani, arkamani, and, amanitore, since, rams, were, considered, a, symbol, of, virility, amun, also, became, thought, of, as, a, fertility, deity, and, so, started, to, absorb, the, identity, of, min, becoming, amun, min, this, association, with, virility, led, to, amun, min, gaining, the, epithet, kamutef, meaning, bull, of, his, mother, in, which, form, he, was, found, depicted, on, the, walls, of, karnak, ithyphallic, and, with, a, flail, as, min, was, as, the, cult, of, amun, grew, in, importance, amun, became, identified, with, the, chief, deity, who, was, worshipped, in, other, areas, during, that, period, namely, the, sun, god, ra, this, identification, led, to, another, merger, of, identities, with, amun, becoming, amun, ra, in, the, hymn, to, amun, ra, he, is, described, as, lord, of, truth, father, of, the, gods, maker, of, men, creator, of, all, animals, lord, of, things, that, are, creator, of, the, staff, of, life, during, the, latter, part, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, the, pharaoh, akhenaten, also, known, as, amenhotep, iv, advanced, the, worship, of, the, aten, a, deity, whose, power, was, manifested, in, the, sun, disk, both, literally, and, symbolically, he, defaced, the, symbols, of, many, of, the, old, deities, and, based, his, religious, practices, upon, the, deity, the, aten, he, moved, his, capital, away, from, thebes, but, this, abrupt, change, was, very, unpopular, with, the, priests, of, amun, who, now, found, themselves, without, any, of, their, former, power, the, religion, of, egypt, was, inexorably, tied, to, the, leadership, of, the, country, the, pharaoh, being, the, leader, of, both, the, pharaoh, was, the, highest, priest, in, the, temple, of, the, capital, and, the, next, lower, level, of, religious, leaders, were, important, advisers, to, the, pharaoh, many, being, administrators, of, the, bureaucracy, that, ran, the, country, the, introduction, of, atenism, under, akhenaten, constructed, a, monolatrist, worship, of, aten, in, direct, competition, with, that, of, amun, praises, of, amun, on, stelae, are, strikingly, similar, in, language, to, those, later, used, in, particular, the, hymn, to, the, aten, when, thou, crossest, the, sky, all, faces, behold, thee, but, when, thou, departest, thou, are, hidden, from, their, faces, when, thou, settest, in, the, western, mountain, then, they, sleep, in, the, manner, of, death, the, fashioner, of, that, which, the, soil, produces, a, mother, of, profit, to, gods, and, men, a, patient, craftsman, greatly, wearying, himself, as, their, maker, valiant, herdsman, driving, his, cattle, their, refuge, and, the, making, of, their, living, the, sole, lord, who, reaches, the, end, of, the, lands, every, day, as, one, who, sees, them, that, tread, thereon, every, land, chatters, at, his, rising, every, day, in, order, to, praise, him, when, akhenaten, died, akhenaten, s, successor, smenkhkare, became, pharaoh, and, atenism, remained, established, during, his, brief, 2, year, reign, when, smenkhkare, died, an, enigmatic, female, pharaoh, known, as, neferneferuaten, took, the, throne, for, a, brief, period, but, it, is, unclear, what, happened, during, her, reign, after, neferneferuaten, s, death, akhenaten, s, 9, year, old, son, tutankhaten, succeeded, her, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, the, young, pharaoh, reversed, atenism, re, establishing, the, old, polytheistic, religion, and, renaming, himself, tutankhamun, his, sister, wife, then, named, ankhesenpaaten, followed, him, and, was, renamed, ankhesenamun, worship, of, the, aten, ceased, for, the, most, part, and, worship, of, amun, ra, was, restored, during, the, reign, of, horemheb, akhenaten, s, name, was, struck, from, egyptian, records, all, of, his, religious, and, governmental, changes, were, undone, and, the, capital, was, returned, to, thebes, the, return, to, the, previous, capital, and, its, patron, deity, was, accomplished, so, swiftly, that, it, seemed, this, monolatrist, cult, and, its, governmental, reforms, had, never, existed, the, god, of, wind, amun, came, to, be, identified, with, the, solar, god, ra, and, the, god, of, fertility, and, creation, min, so, that, amun, ra, had, the, main, characteristic, of, a, solar, god, creator, god, and, fertility, god, he, also, adopted, the, aspect, of, the, ram, from, the, nubian, solar, god, besides, numerous, other, titles, and, aspects, as, amun, ra, he, was, petitioned, for, mercy, by, those, who, believed, suffering, had, come, about, as, a, result, of, their, own, or, others, wrongdoing, amun, ra, who, hears, the, prayer, who, comes, at, the, cry, of, the, poor, and, distressed, beware, of, him, repeat, him, to, son, and, daughter, to, great, and, small, relate, him, to, generations, of, generations, who, have, not, yet, come, into, being, relate, him, to, fishes, in, the, deep, to, birds, in, heaven, repeat, him, to, him, who, does, not, know, him, and, to, him, who, knows, him, though, it, may, be, that, the, servant, is, normal, in, doing, wrong, yet, the, lord, is, normal, in, being, merciful, the, lord, of, thebes, does, not, spend, an, entire, day, angry, as, for, his, anger, in, the, completion, of, a, moment, there, is, no, remnant, as, thy, ka, endures, thou, wilt, be, merciful, in, the, leiden, hymns, amun, ptah, and, re, are, regarded, as, a, trinity, who, are, distinct, gods, but, with, unity, in, plurality, the, three, gods, are, one, yet, the, egyptian, elsewhere, insists, on, the, separate, identity, of, each, of, the, three, this, unity, in, plurality, is, expressed, in, one, text, all, gods, are, three, amun, re, and, ptah, whom, none, equals, he, who, hides, his, name, as, amun, he, appears, to, the, face, as, re, his, body, is, ptah, henri, frankfort, suggested, that, amun, was, originally, a, wind, god, and, speculating, pointed, out, that, the, implicit, connection, between, the, winds, and, mysteriousness, was, paralleled, in, a, passage, from, the, gospel, of, john, the, wind, blows, where, it, wishes, and, you, hear, the, sound, of, it, but, do, not, know, where, it, comes, from, and, where, it, is, going, a, leiden, hymn, to, amun, describes, how, he, calms, stormy, seas, for, the, troubled, sailor, the, tempest, moves, aside, for, the, sailor, who, remembers, the, name, of, amon, the, storm, becomes, a, sweet, breeze, for, he, who, invokes, his, name, amon, is, more, effective, than, millions, for, he, who, places, him, in, his, heart, thanks, to, him, the, single, man, becomes, stronger, than, a, crowd, while, not, regarded, as, a, dynasty, the, high, priests, of, amun, at, thebes, were, nevertheless, of, such, power, and, influence, that, they, were, effectively, the, rulers, of, egypt, from, 1080, to, c, 943, bc, by, the, time, herihor, was, proclaimed, as, the, first, ruling, high, priest, of, amun, in, 1080, bc, in, the, 19th, year, of, ramesses, xi, the, amun, priesthood, exercised, an, effective, hold, on, egypt, s, economy, the, amun, priests, owned, two, thirds, of, all, the, temple, lands, in, egypt, and, 90, percent, of, her, ships, and, many, other, resources, consequently, the, amun, priests, were, as, powerful, as, the, pharaoh, if, not, more, so, one, of, the, sons, of, the, high, priest, pinedjem, would, eventually, assume, the, throne, and, rule, egypt, for, almost, half, a, century, as, pharaoh, psusennes, i, while, the, theban, high, priest, psusennes, iii, would, take, the, throne, as, king, psusennes, ii, the, final, ruler, of, the, 21st, dynasty, in, the, 10th, century, bc, the, overwhelming, dominance, of, amun, over, all, of, egypt, gradually, began, to, decline, in, thebes, however, his, worship, continued, unabated, especially, under, the, nubian, twenty, fifth, dynasty, of, egypt, as, amun, was, by, now, seen, as, a, national, god, in, nubia, the, temple, of, amun, jebel, barkal, founded, during, the, new, kingdom, came, to, be, the, center, of, the, religious, ideology, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, the, victory, stele, of, piye, at, gebel, barkal, 8th, century, bc, now, distinguishes, between, an, amun, of, napata, and, an, amun, of, thebes, tantamani, died, 653, bc, the, last, pharaoh, of, the, nubian, dynasty, still, bore, a, theophoric, name, referring, to, amun, in, the, nubian, form, amani, in, areas, outside, egypt, where, the, egyptians, had, previously, brought, the, cult, of, amun, his, worship, continued, into, classical, antiquity, in, nubia, where, his, name, was, pronounced, amane, or, amani, he, remained, a, national, deity, with, his, priests, at, meroe, and, nobatia, regulating, the, whole, government, of, the, country, via, an, oracle, choosing, the, ruler, and, directing, military, expeditions, according, to, diodorus, siculus, these, religious, leaders, were, even, able, to, compel, kings, to, commit, suicide, although, this, tradition, stopped, when, arkamane, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, slew, them, in, sudan, excavation, of, an, amun, temple, at, dangeil,

destruction, the, temple, gradually, decayed, and, collapsed, in, siwa, oasis, located, western, egypt, there, remained, a, solitary, oracle, of, amun, near, the, libyan, desert, the, worship, of, ammon, was, introduced, into, greece, at, an, early, period, probably, through, the, medium, of, the, greek, colony, in, cyrene, which, must, have, formed, a, connection, with, the, great, oracle, of, ammon, in, the, oasis, soon, after, its, establishment, iarbas, a, mythological, king, of, libya, was, also, considered, a, son, of, hammon, according, to, the, 6th, century, ad, author, corippus, a, libyan, people, known, as, the, laguatan, carried, an, effigy, of, their, god, gurzil, whom, they, believed, to, be, the, son, of, ammon, into, battle, against, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, 540s,
