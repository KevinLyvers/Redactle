proposed, etymology, of, the, name, is, luwian, pihassas, lightning, and, pihassassi, a, local, luwian, hittite, name, in, southern, cilicia, of, a, weather, deity, associated, with, thunder, and, lightning, the, proponents, of, this, etymology, adduce, the, role, of, pegasus, reported, as, early, as, hesiod, as, the, bringer, of, thunderbolts, to, zeus, that, interpretation, was, first, suggested, in, 1952, and, remains, widely, accepted, but, robin, lane, fox, 2009, has, criticized, it, as, implausible, according, to, early, myths, everywhere, the, winged, horse, struck, his, hoof, to, the, earth, an, inspiring, water, spring, burst, forth, one, of, these, springs, was, upon, the, muses, mount, helicon, the, hippocrene, horse, spring, antoninus, liberalis, has, suggested, that, it, was, opened, at, the, behest, of, poseidon, to, prevent, the, mountain, from, swelling, with, rapture, at, the, song, of, the, muses, another, spring, associated, with, pegasus, was, at, troezen, hesiod, relates, how, pegasus, was, peacefully, drinking, from, a, spring, when, the, hero, bellerophon, captured, him, hesiod, wrote, that, pegasus, carried, thunderbolts, for, zeus, there, are, several, versions, of, the, birth, of, the, winged, stallion, and, his, brother, chrysaor, in, the, far, distant, place, at, the, edge, of, earth, hesiod, s, springs, of, oceanus, which, encircles, the, inhabited, earth, where, perseus, found, medusa, one, is, that, they, sprang, from, the, blood, issuing, from, medusa, s, neck, as, perseus, was, beheading, her, similar, to, the, manner, in, which, athena, was, born, from, the, head, of, zeus, after, he, swallowed, her, pregnant, mother, in, another, version, when, perseus, beheaded, medusa, the, brothers, were, born, of, the, earth, when, the, gorgon, s, blood, fell, upon, her, a, variation, of, this, story, holds, that, they, were, formed, from, the, mingling, of, medusa, s, blood, pain, and, sea, foam, implying, that, poseidon, had, involvement, in, their, making, the, last, version, bears, resemblance, to, hesiod, s, account, of, the, birth, of, aphrodite, from, the, foam, created, when, the, severed, genitals, of, uranus, were, cast, into, the, sea, by, cronus, pegasus, aided, the, hero, bellerophon, in, his, fight, against, the, chimera, there, are, varying, tales, about, how, bellerophon, found, pegasus, the, most,

next, morning, still, clutching, the, bridle, bellerophon, found, pegasus, drinking, at, the, pierian, spring, caught, him, and, eventually, tamed, him, michaud, s, biographie, universelle, relates, that, when, pegasus, was, born, he, flew, to, where, thunder, and, lightning, are, released, then, according, to, certain, versions, of, the, myth, athena, tamed, him, and, gave, him, to, perseus, who, flew, to, ethiopia, to, help, andromeda, after, bellerophon, fell, off, pegasus, while, trying, to, reach, olympus, pegasus, and, athena, left, him, and, continued, to, olympus, where, he, was, stabled, with, other, steeds, belonging, to, zeus, and, was, given, the, task, of, carrying, zeus, thunderbolts, along, with, other, members, of, his, entourage, his, attendants, handmaidens, shield, bearers, shieldmaidens, astrape, and, bronte, because, of, his, years, of, faithful, service, to, zeus, pegasus, was, later, honoured, with, transformation, into, a, constellation, on, the, day, of,
