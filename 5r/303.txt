ancient, celtic, religion, commonly, known, as, celtic, paganism, was, the, religion, of, the, ancient, celtic, peoples, of, europe, because, there, are, no, extant, native, records, of, their, beliefs, evidence, about, their, religion, is, gleaned, from, archaeology, greco, roman, accounts, some, of, them, hostile, and, probably, not, well, informed, and, literature, from, the, early, christian, period, celtic, paganism, was, one, of, a, larger, group, of, polytheistic, indo, european, religions, of, iron, age, europe, while, the, specific, deities, worshipped, varied, by, region, and, over, time, underlying, this, were, broad, similarities, in, both, deities, and, a, basic, religious, homogeneity, among, the, celtic, peoples, widely, worshipped, celtic, gods, included, lugus, toutatis, taranis, cernunnos, epona, maponos, belenos, ogmios, and, sucellos, sacred, springs, were, often, associated, with, celtic, healing, deities, triplicity, is, a, common, theme, with, a, number, of, deities, seen, as, threefold, for, example, the, three, mothers, the, druids, were, the, priests, of, celtic, religion, but, little, is, definitively, known, about, them, greco, roman, writers, said, the, celts, held, ceremonies, in, sacred, groves, and, other, natural, shrines, called, nemetons, while, some, celtic, peoples, also, built, temples, or, ritual, enclosures, celtic, peoples, often, made, votive, offerings, which, would, be, deposited, in, water, and, wetlands, or, in, ritual, shafts, and, wells, there, is, evidence, that, ancient, celtic, peoples, sacrificed, animals, almost, always, livestock, or, working, animals, there, is, some, evidence, that, ancient, celts, sacrificed, humans, and, caesar, in, his, accounts, of, the, gallic, wars, claims, that, the, gauls, sacrificed, criminals, by, burning, them, in, a, wicker, man, though, this, may, have, been, imperial, propaganda, celtic, paganism, as, practiced, by, the, ancient, celts, is, a, descendant, of, proto, celtic, paganism, itself, derived, from, proto, indo, european, paganism, many, deities, in, celtic, mythologies, have, cognates, in, other, indo, european, mythologies, such, as, celtic, brigantia, with, roman, aurora, vedic, ushas, and, norse, aurvandill, welsh, arianrhod, with, greek, selene, baltic, m, nuo, and, slavic, myesyats, and, irish, danu, with, hindu, danu, and, the, namesake, of, multiple, hydronyms, such, as, the, danube, don, and, dnieper, after, the, roman, empire, s, conquest, of, gaul, 58, 51, bce, and, southern, britain, 43, ce, celtic, religion, there, underwent, some, romanisation, resulting, in, a, syncretic, gallo, roman, religion, with, deities, such, as, lenus, mars, apollo, grannus, and, telesphorus, the, gauls, gradually, converted, to, christianity, from, the, third, century, onward, after, the, end, of, roman, rule, in, britain, c, 410, ce, celtic, paganism, began, to, be, replaced, by, anglo, saxon, paganism, over, much, of, what, became, england, the, celtic, populations, of, britain, and, ireland, gradually, converted, to, christianity, from, the, fifth, century, onward, however, celtic, paganism, left, a, legacy, in, many, of, the, celtic, nations, influenced, mythology, and, in, the, 20th, century, served, as, the, basis, for, a, new, religious, movement, celtic, neopaganism, some, figures, from, medieval, irish, mythology, are, believed, to, be, versions, of, earlier, deities, according, to, miranda, aldhouse, green, the, celts, were, also, animists, believing, that, every, part, of, the, natural, world, had, a, spirit, various, neopagan, groups, claim, association, with, celtic, paganism, these, groups, range, from, the, reconstructionists, who, work, to, practise, ancient, celtic, religion, with, as, much, accuracy, as, possible, to, new, age, eclectic, groups, who, take, some, of, their, inspiration, from, celtic, mythology, and, iconography, the, most, notable, of, which, is, neo, druidry, comparatively, little, is, known, about, celtic, paganism, because, the, evidence, for, it, is, fragmentary, due, largely, to, the, fact, that, the, celts, who, practised, it, wrote, nothing, down, about, their, religion, therefore, all, there, is, to, study, their, religion, from, is, the, literature, from, the, early, christian, period, commentaries, from, classical, greek, and, roman, scholars, and, archaeological, evidence, the, archaeologist, barry, cunliffe, summarised, the, sources, for, celtic, religion, as, fertile, chaos, borrowing, the, term, from, the, irish, scholar, proinsias, maccana, cunliffe, went, on, to, note, that, there, is, more, varied, evidence, for, celtic, religion, than, for, any, other, example, of, celtic, life, the, only, problem, is, to, assemble, it, in, a, systematic, form, which, does, not, too, greatly, oversimplify, the, intricate, texture, of, its, detail, the, archaeological, evidence, does, not, contain, the, bias, inherent, in, the, literary, sources, nonetheless, the, interpretation, of, this, evidence, can, be, coloured, by, the, 21st, century, mindset, various, archaeological, discoveries, have, aided, understanding, of, the, religion, of, the, celts, most, surviving, celtic, art, is, not, figurative, some, art, historians, have, suggested, that, the, complex, and, compelling, decorative, motifs, that, characterize, some, periods, have, a, religious, significance, but, the, understanding, of, what, that, might, be, appears, to, be, irretrievably, lost, surviving, figurative, monumental, sculpture, comes, almost, entirely, from, romano, celtic, contexts, and, broadly, follows, provincial, roman, styles, though, figures, who, are, probably, deities, often, wear, torcs, and, there, may, be, inscriptions, in, roman, letters, with, what, appear, to, be, romanized, celtic, names, the, pillar, of, the, boatmen, from, paris, with, many, deity, figures, is, the, most, comprehensive, example, datable, by, a, dedication, to, the, emperor, tiberius, r, from, 14, ad, monumental, stone, sculptures, from, before, conquest, by, the, romans, are, much, more, rare, and, it, is, far, from, clear, that, deities, are, represented, the, most, significant, are, the, warrior, of, hirschlanden, and, glauberg, prince, respectively, 6th, and, 5th, century, bc, from, germany, the, m, eck, ehrovice, head, probably, 2nd, century, bc, czech, republic, and, sanctuaries, of, some, sort, at, the, southern, french, oppida, of, roquepertuse, and, entremont, there, are, also, a, number, of, celtiberian, standing, warrior, figures, and, several, other, stone, heads, from, various, areas, in, general, even, early, monumental, sculpture, is, found, in, areas, with, higher, levels, of, contact, with, the, classical, world, through, trade, it, is, possible, that, wooden, monumental, sculpture, was, more, common, small, heads, are, more, common, mainly, surviving, as, ornament, in, metalwork, and, there, are, also, animals, and, birds, that, may, have, a, religious, significance, as, on, the, basse, yutz, flagons, the, strettweg, cult, wagon, is, probably, associated, with, libations, or, sacrifices, and, pairs, of, metal, spoons, probably, used, for, divination, have, been, found, celtic, coinage, from, the, late, 4th, century, bc, until, conquest, clearly, copies, greek, and, roman, examples, sometimes, very, closely, but, the, heads, and, horses, that, are, the, most, popular, motifs, may, have, a, local, religious, significance, there, are, also, the, coins, of, the, roman, provinces, in, the, celtic, lands, of, gaul, raetia, noricum, and, britannia, most, of, the, surviving, monuments, and, their, accompanying, inscriptions, belong, to, the, roman, period, and, reflect, a, considerable, degree, of, syncretism, between, celtic, and, roman, gods, even, where, figures, and, motifs, appear, to, derive, from, pre, roman, tradition, they, are, difficult, to, interpret, in, the, absence, of, a, preserved, literature, on, mythology, a, notable, example, of, this, is, the, horned, god, that, was, called, cernunnos, several, depictions, and, inscriptions, of, him, have, been, found, but, very, little, is, known, about, the, myths, that, would, have, been, associated, with, him, or, how, he, was, worshipped, literary, evidence, for, celtic, religion, also, comes, from, sources, written, in, ireland, and, wales, during, the, middle, ages, a, period, when, traditional, celtic, religious, practices, had, become, extinct, and, had, long, been, replaced, by, christianity, the, evidence, from, ireland, has, been, recognised, as, better, than, that, from, wales, being, viewed, as, both, older, and, less, contaminated, from, foreign, material, these, sources, which, are, in, the, form, of, epic, poems, and, tales, were, written, several, centuries, after, christianity, became, the, dominant, religion, in, these, regions, and, were, written, down, by, christian, monks, who, may, not, merely, have, been, hostile, to, the, earlier, paganism, but, actually, ignorant, of, it, instead, of, treating, the, characters, as, deities, they, are, allocated, the, roles, of, being, historical, heroes, who, sometimes, have, supernatural, or, superhuman, powers, for, instance, in, the, irish, sources, the, gods, are, claimed, to, be, an, ancient, tribe, of, humans, known, as, the, tuatha, d, danann, while, it, is, possible, to, single, out, specific, texts, that, can, be, strongly, argued, to, encapsulate, genuine, echoes, or, resonances, of, the, pre, christian, past, opinion, is, divided, as, to, whether, these, texts, contain, substantive, material, derived, from, oral, tradition, as, preserved, by, bards, or, whether, they, were, the, creation, of, the, medieval, monastic, tradition, various, greek, and, roman, writers, of, the, ancient, world, commented, on, the, celts, and, their, beliefs, barry, cunliffe, stated, that, the, greek, and, roman, texts, provide, a, number, of, pertinent, observations, but, these, are, at, best, anecdotal, offered, largely, as, a, colourful, background, by, writers, whose, prime, intention, was, to, communicate, other, messages, the, roman, general, julius, caesar, when, leading, the, conquering, armies, of, the, roman, republic, against, celtic, gaul, made, various, descriptions, of, the, inhabitants, though, some, of, his, claims, such, as, that, the, druids, practised, human, sacrifice, by, burning, people, in, wicker, men, have, come, under, scrutiny, by, modern, scholars, however, the, key, problem, with, the, use, of, these, sources, is, that, they, were, often, biased, against, the, celts, whom, the, classical, peoples, viewed, as, barbarians, in, the, case, of, the, romans, who, conquered, several, celtic, realms, they, would, have, likely, been, biased, in, favour, of, making, the, celts, look, uncivilised, thereby, giving, the, civilised, romans, more, reason, to, conquer, them, celtic, religion, was, polytheistic, believing, in, many, deities, both, gods, and, goddesses, some, of, which, were, venerated, only, in, a, small, area, or, region, or, by, a, particular, tribe, but, others, whose, worship, had, a, wider, geographical, distribution, the, names, of, over, two, hundred, celtic, deities, have, survived, see, list, of, celtic, deities, although, it, is, likely, that, many, of, these, were, alternative, names, regional, names, or, titles, for, the, same, deity, the, various, celtic, peoples, seem, to, have, had, a, father, god, who, was, often, a, god, of, the, tribe, and, of, the, dead, toutatis, probably, being, one, name, for, him, and, a, mother, goddess, who, was, associated, with, the, land, earth, and, fertility, matrona, probably, being, one, name, for, her, the, mother, goddess, could, also, take, the, form, of, a, war, goddess, as, protectress, of, her, tribe, and, its, land, for, example, andraste, there, also, seems, to, have, been, a, male, celestial, god, identified, with, taranis, associated, with, thunder, the, wheel, and, the, bull, there, were, gods, of, skill, and, craft, such, as, the, pan, regional, god, lugus, and, the, smith, god, gobannos, celtic, healing, deities, were, often, associated, with, sacred, springs, such, as, sirona, and, borvo, other, pan, regional, deities, include, the, horned, god, cernunnos, the, horse, and, fertility, goddess, epona, the, divine, son, maponos, as, well, as, belenos, ogmios, and, sucellos, some, deities, were, seen, as, threefold, for, example, the, three, mothers, some, greco, roman, writers, such, as, julius, caesar, did, not, record, the, native, celtic, names, of, the, deities, but, instead, referred, to, them, by, their, apparent, roman, or, greek, equivalents, he, declared, that, the, most, widely, venerated, gaulish, god, was, mercury, the, roman, god, of, trade, saying, they, also, worshipped, apollo, minerva, mars, and, jupiter, caesar, says, the, gauls, believed, they, all, descended, from, a, god, of, the, dead, and, underworld, whom, he, likened, to, d, s, pater, according, to, other, classical, sources, the, celts, worshipped, the, forces, of, nature, and, did, not, envisage, deities, in, anthropomorphic, terms, in, the, irish, and, welsh, vernacular, sources, from, the, middle, ages, various, human, mythological, figures, were, featured, who, have, been, thought, of, by, many, scholars, as, being, based, upon, earlier, gods, the, historian, ronald, hutton, however, cautioned, against, automatically, characterizing, all, irish, and, welsh, mythological, figures, as, former, deities, noting, that, while, some, characters, who, appear, to, be, human, such, as, medb, or, st, brigit, probably, were, indeed, once, regarded, as, divine, the, warriors, who, are, the, main, protagonists, of, the, stories, have, the, same, status, as, those, in, the, greek, myths, standing, between, the, human, and, divine, orders, to, regard, characters, such, as, c, chulainn, fergus, mac, roich, or, conall, cernach, as, former, gods, turned, into, humans, by, a, later, storyteller, is, to, misunderstand, their, literary, and, religious, function, c, chulainn, is, no, more, a, former, god, than, superman, is, examining, these, irish, myths, barry, cunliffe, stated, that, he, believed, they, displayed, a, dualism, between, the, male, tribal, god, and, the, female, deity, of, the, land, while, anne, ross, felt, that, they, displayed, that, the, gods, were, on, the, whole, intellectual, deeply, versed, in, the, native, learning, poets, and, prophets, story, tellers, and, craftsmen, magicians, healers, warriors, in, short, equipped, with, every, quality, admired, and, desired, by, the, celtic, peoples, themselves, insular, celts, swore, their, oaths, by, their, tribal, gods, and, the, land, sea, and, sky, as, in, i, swear, by, the, gods, by, whom, my, people, swear, and, if, i, break, my, oath, may, the, land, open, to, swallow, me, the, sea, rise, to, drown, me, and, the, sky, fall, upon, me, an, example, of, celtic, threefold, death, some, scholars, such, as, prudence, jones, and, nigel, pennick, have, speculated, that, the, celts, venerated, certain, trees, other, scholars, such, as, miranda, aldhouse, green, believe, that, the, celts, were, animists, believing, that, all, aspects, of, the, natural, world, contained, spirits, and, that, communication, was, possible, with, these, spirits, places, such, as, rocks, streams, mountains, and, trees, may, all, have, had, shrines, or, offerings, devoted, to, a, deity, residing, there, these, would, have, been, local, deities, known, and, worshiped, by, inhabitants, living, near, to, the, shrine, itself, and, not, pan, celtic, like, some, of, the, polytheistic, gods, the, importance, of, trees, in, celtic, religion, may, be, shown, by, the, fact, that, the, very, name, of, the, eburonian, tribe, contains, a, reference, to, the, yew, tree, and, that, names, like, mac, cuilinn, son, of, holly, and, mac, ibar, son, of, yew, appear, in, irish, myths, in, ireland, wisdom, was, symbolised, by, the, salmon, who, feed, on, the, hazelnuts, from, the, trees, that, surround, the, well, of, wisdom, tobar, segais, the, relatively, few, animal, figures, in, early, celtic, art, include, many, water, birds, and, it, is, speculated, that, their, ability, to, move, on, the, air, water, and, land, gave, them, a, special, status, or, significance, among, the, celts, examples, include, the, torrs, pony, cap, and, horns, scotland, basse, yutz, flagons, france, wandsworth, shield, england, and, the, dunaverney, flesh, hook, late, bronze, age, ireland, celtic, burial, practices, which, included, burying, grave, goods, of, food, weapons, and, ornaments, with, the, dead, suggest, a, belief, in, life, after, death, a, common, factor, in, later, mythologies, from, christianized, celtic, nations, was, the, otherworld, this, was, the, realm, of, the, fairy, folk, and, other, supernatural, beings, who, would, entice, humans, into, their, realm, sometimes, this, otherworld, was, claimed, to, exist, underground, while, at, other, times, it, was, said, to, lie, far, to, the, west, several, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, otherworld, was, the, celtic, afterlife, though, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, prove, this, evidence, suggests, that, among, the, celts, offerings, to, the, gods, were, made, throughout, the, landscape, both, the, natural, and, the, domestic, there, were, also, sacred, spaces, known, by, the, gallo, brittonic, word, nemeton, plural, nemeta, which, typically, meant, a, sacred, grove, or, clearing, greco, roman, accounts, tell, of, the, celts, worshiping, at, sacred, groves, with, tacitus, describing, how, his, men, cut, down, groves, sacred, to, savage, rites, by, their, very, nature, such, groves, would, not, survive, in, the, archaeological, record, and, so, we, have, no, direct, evidence, for, them, today, certain, springs, were, also, seen, as, sacred, and, used, as, places, of, worship, in, the, celtic, world, notable, gaulish, examples, include, the, sanctuary, of, sequana, at, the, source, of, the, seine, in, burgundy, and, chamalieres, near, to, clermont, ferrand, at, both, of, these, sites, a, large, array, of, votive, offerings, have, been, uncovered, most, of, which, are, wooden, carvings, although, some, of, which, are, embossed, metal, during, the, iron, age, the, celtic, peoples, of, gaul, belgica, and, britain, built, temples, comprising, square, or, circular, timber, buildings, usually, set, within, a, rectangular, enclosure, celtic, peoples, further, east, in, what, is, now, southern, germany, celtic, peoples, built, rectangular, ditched, enclosures, known, as, viereckschanzen, in, some, cases, these, were, sacred, spaces, where, votive, offerings, were, buried, in, deep, shafts, in, ireland, religious, buildings, and, enclosures, were, circular, according, to, barry, cunliffe, the, monumentality, of, the, irish, religious, sites, sets, them, apart, from, their, british, and, continental, european, counterparts, the, most, notable, examples, being, the, hill, of, tara, temair, and, navan, fort, emain, macha, in, many, cases, when, the, roman, empire, conquered, celtic, lands, earlier, iron, age, sacred, sites, were, reused, and, roman, temples, built, on, them, romano, celtic, temples, latin, fanum, are, found, only, in, the, northwestern, celtic, regions, of, the, empire, they, differ, from, classical, roman, temples, and, their, layouts, are, believed, to, be, hugely, influenced, by, earlier, celtic, wooden, temples, the, celts, made, votive, offerings, to, their, deities, which, were, buried, in, the, earth, or, thrown, into, rivers, or, bogs, according, to, barry, cunliffe, in, most, cases, deposits, were, placed, in, the, same, places, on, numerous, occasions, indicating, continual, usage, over, a, period, of, time, perhaps, on, a, seasonal, basis, or, when, a, particular, event, past, or, pending, demanded, a, propitiatory, response, in, particular, there, was, a, trend, to, offer, items, associated, with, warfare, in, watery, areas, evidence, for, which, is, found, not, only, in, the, celtic, regions, but, also, in, late, bronze, age, and, therefore, pre, celtic, societies, and, those, outside, of, the, celtic, area, namely, denmark, one, of, the, most, notable, examples, is, the, river, thames, in, southern, england, where, a, number, of, items, had, been, deposited, only, to, be, discovered, by, archaeologists, millennia, later, some, of, these, like, the, battersea, shield, wandsworth, shield, and, the, waterloo, helmet, would, have, been, prestige, goods, that, would, have, been, labour, intensive, to, make, and, thereby, probably, expensive, another, example, is, at, llyn, cerrig, bach, in, anglesey, wales, where, offerings, primarily, those, related, to, battle, were, thrown, into, the, lake, from, a, rocky, outcrop, in, the, late, first, century, bc, or, early, first, century, ad, at, times, jewellery, and, other, high, prestige, items, that, were, not, related, to, warfare, were, also, deposited, in, a, ritual, context, at, niederzier, in, the, rhineland, for, example, a, post, that, excavators, believed, had, religious, significance, had, a, bowl, buried, next, to, it, in, which, was, contained, forty, five, coins, two, torcs, and, an, armlet, all, made, of, gold, and, similar, deposits, have, been, uncovered, elsewhere, in, celtic, europe, there, is, evidence, that, ancient, celtic, peoples, sacrificed, animals, which, were, almost, always, livestock, or, working, animals, the, idea, seems, to, have, been, that, ritually, transferring, a, life, force, to, the, otherworld, pleased, the, gods, and, established, a, channel, of, communication, between, the, worlds, animal, sacrifices, could, be, acts, of, thanksgiving, appeasement, to, ask, for, good, health, and, fertility, or, as, a, means, of, divination, it, seems, that, some, animals, were, offered, wholly, to, the, gods, by, burying, or, burning, while, some, were, shared, between, gods, and, humans, part, eaten, and, part, set, aside, pliny, the, elder, a, roman, author, and, military, commander, in, the, 1st, century, ad, wrote, of, druids, performing, a, ritual, whereby, they, sacrificed, two, white, bulls, cut, mistletoe, from, a, sacred, oak, with, a, golden, sickle, and, used, it, to, make, an, elixir, to, cure, infertility, and, poison, archaeologists, found, that, at, some, gaulish, and, british, sanctuaries, horses, and, cattle, were, killed, and, their, whole, bodies, carefully, buried, at, gournay, sur, aronde, the, animals, were, left, to, decompose, before, their, bones, were, buried, around, the, bounds, of, the, sanctuary, along, with, numerous, broken, weapons, this, was, repeated, at, regular, intervals, of, about, ten, years, an, avenue, of, animal, pit, burials, led, to, a, sacred, building, at, cadbury, in, southern, britain, some, british, tribes, carefully, buried, animals, especially, horses, and, dogs, in, grain, storage, pits, it, is, believed, these, were, thanksgiving, sacrifices, to, underworld, gods, once, the, stores, reached, the, end, of, their, use, irish, mythology, describes, the, tarbfeis, bull, feast, a, shamanistic, ritual, in, which, a, bull, would, be, sacrificed, and, a, seer, would, sleep, in, the, bull, s, hide, to, have, a, vision, of, the, future, king, following, the, 12th, century, norman, invasion, of, ireland, norman, writer, gerald, of, wales, wrote, in, his, topographia, hibernica, that, the, irish, kings, of, tyrconnell, were, inaugurated, with, a, horse, sacrifice, he, writes, that, a, white, mare, was, sacrificed, and, cooked, into, a, broth, which, the, king, bathed, in, and, drank, from, this, has, been, seen, as, propaganda, meant, to, paint, the, irish, as, a, barbaric, people, however, there, may, be, some, truth, in, the, account, there, are, rare, mentions, of, similar, horse, sacrifices, associated, with, kingship, in, scandinavia, and, india, see, ashvamedha, there, is, some, evidence, that, ancient, celtic, peoples, practiced, human, sacrifice, accounts, of, celtic, human, sacrifice, come, from, roman, and, greek, sources, julius, caesar, and, strabo, wrote, that, the, gauls, burnt, animal, and, human, sacrifices, in, a, large, wickerwork, figure, known, as, a, wicker, man, and, said, the, human, victims, were, usually, criminals, posidonius, wrote, that, druids, who, oversaw, human, sacrifices, foretold, the, future, by, watching, the, death, throes, of, the, victims, caesar, also, wrote, that, slaves, of, gaulish, chiefs, would, be, burnt, along, with, the, body, of, their, master, as, part, of, his, funeral, in, the, 1st, century, ad, roman, writer, lucan, mentioned, human, sacrifices, to, the, gaulish, gods, esus, toutatis, and, taranis, in, a, 4th, century, commentary, on, lucan, an, unnamed, author, added, that, sacrifices, to, esus, were, hanged, from, a, tree, those, to, toutatis, were, drowned, and, those, to, taranis, were, burned, according, to, the, 2nd, century, roman, writer, cassius, dio, boudica, s, forces, impaled, roman, captives, during, her, rebellion, against, the, roman, occupation, to, the, accompaniment, of, revelry, and, sacrifices, in, the, sacred, groves, of, andate, historians, note, that, these, greco, roman, accounts, should, be, taken, with, caution, as, it, benefited, them, to, make, the, celts, sound, barbaric, there, is, some, archaeological, evidence, of, human, sacrifice, among, celtic, peoples, although, it, is, rare, ritual, beheading, and, headhunting, was, a, major, religious, and, cultural, practice, which, has, found, copious, support, in, archaeology, including, the, many, skulls, found, in, londinium, s, river, walbrook, and, the, headless, bodies, at, the, gaulish, sanctuary, of, gournay, sur, aronde, several, ancient, irish, bog, bodies, have, been, interpreted, as, kings, who, were, ritually, killed, presumably, after, serious, crop, failures, or, other, disasters, some, were, deposited, in, bogs, on, territorial, boundaries, which, were, seen, as, liminal, places, or, near, royal, inauguration, sites, and, some, were, found, to, have, eaten, a, ceremonial, last, meal, the, iconography, of, the, human, head, is, believed, by, many, archaeologists, and, historians, to, have, played, a, significant, part, in, celtic, religion, it, has, been, referred, to, as, a, head, cult, or, cult, of, the, severed, head, the, celts, had, a, reputation, as, head, hunters, among, the, romans, and, greeks, writing, in, the, 1st, century, bc, the, greek, historians, posidonius, and, diodorus, siculus, said, celtic, warriors, cut, off, the, heads, of, enemies, slain, in, battle, hung, them, from, the, necks, of, their, horses, then, nailed, them, up, outside, their, homes, strabo, wrote, in, the, same, century, that, celts, embalmed, the, heads, of, their, most, esteemed, enemies, in, cedar, oil, and, put, them, on, display, the, roman, historian, livy, wrote, that, the, boii, beheaded, the, defeated, roman, general, after, the, battle, of, silva, litana, covered, his, skull, in, gold, and, used, it, as, a, ritual, cup, archaeologists, have, found, evidence, that, heads, were, embalmed, and, displayed, by, the, southern, gauls, in, another, example, at, the, southern, gaulish, site, of, entremont, there, was, a, pillar, carved, with, skulls, within, which, were, niches, where, human, skulls, were, kept, nailed, into, position, fifteen, of, which, were, found, roquepertuse, nearby, has, similar, heads, and, skull, niches, many, standalone, carved, stone, heads, have, been, found, in, celtic, regions, some, with, two, or, three, faces, examples, include, the, m, eck, ehrovice, and, corleck, heads, severed, heads, are, a, common, motif, in, insular, celtic, myths, and, there, are, many, tales, in, which, living, heads, preside, over, feasts, and, or, speak, prophecies, the, beheading, game, is, a, trope, found, in, irish, myth, and, arthurian, legend, john, t, koch, says, that, the, efforts, taken, to, preserve, and, display, heads, and, the, frequency, with, which, severed, heads, appear, point, to, a, religious, importance, barry, cunliffe, believed, that, the, celts, held, reverence, for, the, power, of, the, head, and, that, to, own, and, display, a, distinguished, head, was, to, retain, and, control, the, power, of, the, dead, person, likewise, the, archaeologist, anne, ross, asserted, that, the, celts, venerated, the, head, as, a, symbol, of, divinity, and, the, powers, of, the, otherworld, and, regarded, it, as, the, most, important, bodily, member, the, very, seat, of, the, soul, the, folklorist, hilda, ellis, davidson, said, the, early, celts, seem, to, have, venerated, the, head, as, the, seat, of, consciousness, and, wisdom, miranda, aldhouse, green, refuted, suggestions, that, the, head, itself, was, worshipped, but, it, was, clearly, venerated, as, the, most, significant, element, in, a, human, or, divine, image, representing, the, whole, in, contrast, the, historian, ronald, hutton, largely, dismissed, the, idea, of, a, head, cult, believing, that, both, the, literary, and, archaeological, evidence, did, not, warrant, this, conclusion, he, noted, the, frequency, with, which, human, heads, appear, upon, celtic, metalwork, proves, nothing, more, than, they, were, a, favourite, decorative, motif, among, several, and, one, just, as, popular, among, non, celtic, peoples, according, to, a, number, of, greco, roman, writers, such, as, julius, caesar, cicero, tacitus, and, pliny, the, elder, gaulish, and, british, society, held, a, group, of, magico, religious, specialists, known, as, the, druids, in, high, esteem, their, roles, and, responsibilities, differed, somewhat, between, the, different, accounts, but, caesar, s, which, was, the, fullest, and, earliest, original, text, to, describe, the, druids, described, them, as, being, concerned, with, divine, worship, the, due, performance, of, sacrifices, private, or, public, and, the, interpretation, of, ritual, questions, he, also, claimed, that, they, were, responsible, for, officiating, at, human, sacrifices, such, as, the, wicker, man, burnings, nonetheless, a, number, of, historians, have, criticised, these, accounts, believing, them, to, be, biased, or, inaccurate, vernacular, irish, sources, also, referred, to, the, druids, portraying, them, not, only, as, priests, but, as, sorcerers, who, had, supernatural, powers, that, they, used, for, cursing, and, divination, and, who, opposed, the, coming, of, christianity, various, historians, and, archaeologists, have, interpreted, the, druids, in, different, ways, peter, berresford, ellis, for, instance, believed, them, to, be, the, equivalents, of, the, indian, brahmin, caste, while, anne, ross, believed, that, they, were, essentially, tribal, priests, having, more, in, common, with, the, shamans, of, tribal, societies, than, with, the, classical, philosophers, ronald, hutton, meanwhile, held, a, particularly, sceptical, attitude, to, many, claims, made, about, them, and, he, supported, the, view, that, the, evidence, available, was, of, such, a, suspicious, nature, that, we, can, know, virtually, nothing, of, certainty, about, the, ancient, druids, so, that, although, they, certainly, existed, they, function, more, or, less, as, legendary, figures, in, ireland, the, fili, were, visionary, poets, which, many, get, confused, with, vates, associated, with, lorekeeping, versecraft, and, the, memorisation, of, vast, numbers, of, poems, they, were, also, magicians, as, irish, magic, is, intrinsically, connected, to, poetry, and, the, satire, of, a, gifted, poet, was, a, serious, curse, upon, the, one, being, satirised, in, ireland, a, bard, was, considered, a, lesser, grade, of, poet, than, a, fili, more, of, a, minstrel, and, rote, reciter, than, an, inspired, artist, with, magical, powers, in, the, welsh, tradition, the, poet, is, always, referred, to, as, a, bardd, the, celtic, poets, of, whatever, grade, were, composers, of, eulogy, and, satire, and, a, chief, duty, was, that, of, composing, and, reciting, verses, on, heroes, and, their, deeds, and, memorising, the, genealogies, of, their, patrons, it, was, essential, to, their, livelihood, that, they, increase, the, fame, of, their, patrons, via, tales, poems, and, songs, in, the, 1st, century, ad, the, latin, author, lucan, referred, to, bards, as, the, national, poets, or, minstrels, of, gaul, and, britain, in, roman, gaul, the, institution, gradually, disappeared, whereas, in, ireland, and, wales, it, survived, into, the, european, middle, ages, in, wales, the, bardic, order, was, revived, and, codified, by, the, poet, and, forger, iolo, morganwg, this, tradition, has, persisted, centred, around, the, many, eisteddfods, at, every, level, of, welsh, literary, society, the, oldest, attested, celtic, calendar, is, the, coligny, calendar, dated, to, the, 2nd, century, and, as, such, firmly, within, the, gallo, roman, period, some, feast, days, of, the, medieval, irish, calendar, have, sometimes, been, speculated, to, descend, from, prehistoric, festivals, especially, by, comparison, to, terms, found, in, the, coligny, calendar, it, is, not, clear, what, religious, festivals, the, ancient, celts, held, but, the, insular, celtic, peoples, celebrated, four, seasonal, festivals, known, to, the, medieval, gaels, as, beltaine, 1, may, lughnasadh, 1, august, samhain, 1, november, and, imbolc, 1, february, beltane, in, particular, is, attributed, ancient, origin, by, medieval, irish, writers, the, festivals, of, samhain, and, imbolc, are, not, associated, with, paganism, or, druidry, in, irish, legend, but, there, have, nevertheless, been, suggestions, of, a, prehistoric, background, since, the, 19th, century, in, the, case, of, samhain, by, john, rhys, and, james, frazer, who, assumed, that, this, festival, marked, the, celtic, new, year, the, celtic, peoples, of, gaul, and, hispania, under, roman, rule, fused, roman, religious, forms, and, modes, of, worship, with, indigenous, traditions, in, some, cases, gaulish, deity, names, were, used, as, epithets, for, roman, deities, as, with, lenus, mars, or, jupiter, poeninus, in, other, cases, roman, gods, were, given, gaulish, female, partners, for, example, mercury, was, paired, with, rosmerta, and, sirona, was, partnered, with, apollo, in, at, least, one, case, that, of, the, equine, goddess, epona, a, native, celtic, goddess, was, also, adopted, by, romans, this, process, of, identifying, celtic, deities, with, their, roman, counterparts, was, known, as, interpretatio, romana, eastern, mystery, religions, penetrated, gaul, early, on, these, included, the, cults, of, orpheus, mithras, cybele, and, isis, the, imperial, cult, centred, primarily, on, the, numen, of, augustus, came, to, play, a, prominent, role, in, public, religion, in, gaul, most, dramatically, at, the, pan, gaulish, ceremony, venerating, rome, and, augustus, at, the, condate, altar, near, lugdunum, on, 1, august, generally, roman, worship, practices, such, as, offerings, of, incense, and, animal, sacrifice, dedicatory, inscriptions, and, naturalistic, statuary, depicting, deities, in, anthropomorphic, form, were, combined, with, specific, gaulish, practices, such, as, circumambulation, around, a, temple, this, gave, rise, to, a, characteristic, gallo, roman, fanum, identifiable, in, archaeology, from, its, concentric, shape, celtic, societies, under, roman, rule, presumably, underwent, a, gradual, christianisation, in, similar, ways, to, the, rest, of, the, empire, there, is, next, to, nothing, in, christian, sources, about, specific, issues, relating, to, celtic, people, in, the, empire, or, their, religion, saint, paul, s, epistle, to, the, galatians, was, addressed, to, a, congregation, that, might, have, included, people, from, a, celtic, background, in, ireland, the, main, celtic, country, unconquered, by, the, romans, the, conversion, to, christianity, christianisation, inevitably, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, socio, religious, system, from, the, 5th, century, onward, though, its, character, can, only, be, extrapolated, from, documents, of, considerably, later, date, by, the, early, 7th, century, the, church, had, succeeded, in, relegating, irish, druids, to, ignominious, irrelevancy, while, the, filidh, masters, of, traditional, learning, operated, in, easy, harmony, with, their, clerical, counterparts, contriving, at, the, same, time, to, retain, a, considerable, part, of, their, pre, christian, tradition, social, status, and, privilege, but, virtually, all, the, vast, corpus, of, early, vernacular, literature, that, has, survived, was, written, down, in, monastic, scriptoria, and, it, is, part, of, the, task, of, modern, scholarship, to, identify, the, relative, roles, of, traditional, continuity, and, ecclesiastical, innovation, as, reflected, in, the, written, texts, cormac, s, glossary, c, 900, ad, recounts, that, st, patrick, banished, those, mantic, rites, of, the, filidh, that, involved, offerings, to, demons, and, that, the, church, took, particular, pains, to, stamp, out, animal, sacrifice, and, other, rituals, repugnant, to, christian, teaching, what, survived, of, ancient, ritual, practice, tended, to, be, related, to, filidhecht, the, traditional, repertoire, of, the, filidh, or, to, the, central, institution, of, sacral, kingship, a, good, example, is, the, pervasive, and, persistent, concept, of, the, hierogamy, sacred, marriage, of, the, king, with, the, goddess, of, sovereignty, the, sexual, union, or, banais, r, ghi, wedding, of, kingship, which, constituted, the, core, of, the, royal, inauguration, seems, to, have, been, purged, from, the, ritual, at, an, early, date, through, ecclesiastical, influence, but, it, remains, at, least, implicit, and, often, quite, explicit, for, many, centuries, in, the, literary, tradition, nagy, has, noted, the, gaelic, oral, tradition, has, been, remarkably, conservative, the, fact, that, we, have, tales, in, existence, that, were, still, being, told, in, the, 19th, century, in, almost, exactly, the, same, form, as, they, exist, in, ancient, manuscripts, leads, to, the, strong, probability, that, much, of, what, the, monks, recorded, was, considerably, older, though, the, christian, interpolations, in, some, of, these, tales, are, very, obvious, many, of, them, read, like, afterthoughts, or, footnotes, to, the, main, body, of, the, tales, which, most, likely, preserve, traditions, far, older, than, the, manuscripts, themselves, mythology, based, on, though, not, identical, to, the, pre, christian, traditions, was, still, common, place, knowledge, in, celtic, speaking, cultures, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, celtic, revival, such, survivals, were, collected, and, edited, thus, becoming, a, literary, tradition, which, in, turn, influenced, modern, mainstream, celticity, several, celtic, celebrations, have, been, practised, in, some, form, since, ancient, times, such, as, the, beltane, festival, and, the, killorglin, puck, fair, which, seems, to, be, a, survival, of, lughnasadh, various, rituals, involving, acts, of, pilgrimage, to, sites, such, as, hills, and, sacred, wells, that, are, believed, to, have, curative, or, otherwise, beneficial, properties, are, still, performed, including, the, tradition, of, clootie, wells, in, scotland, ireland, and, cornwall, and, the, practice, of, well, dressing, in, the, english, midlands, the, same, applies, to, wish, trees, which, are, considered, part, of, the, clootie, well, tradition, based, on, evidence, from, the, european, continent, various, figures, that, are, still, known, in, folklore, in, the, celtic, countries, up, to, today, or, who, take, part, in, post, christian, mythology, are, known, to, have, also, been, worshiped, in, those, areas, that, did, not, have, records, before, christianity, on, the, inishkea, islands, off, the, west, coast, of, ireland, celtic, pagan, rituals, were, seemingly, performed, well, into, the, nineteenth, century, other, possible, remnants, of, celtic, paganism, include, the, irish, strawboy, tradition, and, wren, day, traditions, as, well, as, the, shetlandic, practice, of, skekling, all, of, which, involve, dressing, in, unusual, costumes, made, of, straw, in, twilight, of, the, celtic, gods, 1996, clarke, and, roberts, describe, a, number, of, particularly, conservative, folkloristic, traditions, in, remote, rural, areas, of, great, britain, including, the, peak, district, and, yorkshire, dales, including, claims, of, surviving, pre, christian, celtic, traditions, of, veneration, of, stones, trees, and, bodies, of, water
