mani, 216, 274, ce, in, the, sasanian, empire, manichaeism, teaches, an, elaborate, dualistic, cosmology, describing, the, struggle, between, a, good, spiritual, world, of, light, and, an, evil, material, world, of, darkness, through, an, ongoing, process, that, takes, place, in, human, history, light, is, gradually, removed, from, the, world, of, matter, and, returned, to, the, world, of, light, whence, it, came, mani, s, teaching, was, intended, to, combine, succeed, and, surpass, the, teachings, of, platonism, christianity, zoroastrianism, buddhism, marcionism, hellenistic, and, rabbinic, judaism, gnostic, movements, ancient, greek, religion, babylonian, and, other, mesopotamian, religions, and, mystery, cults, it, reveres, mani, as, the, final, prophet, after, zoroaster, the, gautama, buddha, and, jesus, christ, manichaeism, was, quickly, successful, and, spread, far, through, aramaic, speaking, regions, it, thrived, between, the, third, and, seventh, centuries, and, at, its, height, was, one, of, the, most, widespread, religions, in, the, world, manichaean, churches, and, scriptures, existed, as, far, east, as, the, han, dynasty, and, as, far, west, as, the, roman, empire, it, was, briefly, the, main, rival, to, early, christianity, in, the, competition, to, replace, classical, polytheism, before, the, spread, of, islam, under, the, roman, dominate, manichaeism, was, persecuted, by, the, roman, state, and, was, eventually, stamped, out, in, the, roman, empire, manichaeism, has, survived, longer, in, the, east, than, it, did, in, the, west, although, it, was, thought, to, have, finally, faded, away, after, the, 14th, century, in, south, china, contemporary, to, the, decline, of, the, church, of, the, east, in, ming, china, there, is, a, growing, corpus, of, evidence, that, shows, manichaeism, persists, in, some, areas, of, china, especially, in, fujian, where, numerous, manichaean, relics, have, been, discovered, over, time, the, currently, known, sects, are, notably, secretive, and, protective, of, their, belief, system, in, an, effort, to, remain, undetected, this, stems, from, fears, relating, to, persecution, and, suppression, during, various, periods, of, chinese, history, while, most, of, manichaeism, s, original, writings, have, been, lost, numerous, translations, and, fragmentary, texts, have, survived, an, adherent, of, manichaeism, is, called, a, manichaean, manichean, or, manichee, the, last, especially, in, older, sources, mani, was, an, iranian, born, in, 216, ce, in, or, near, seleucia, ctesiphon, now, al, mada, in, iraq, in, the, parthian, empire, according, to, the, cologne, mani, codex, mani, s, parents, were, members, of, the, jewish, christian, gnostic, sect, known, as, the, elcesaites, mani, composed, seven, works, six, of, which, were, written, in, the, late, aramaic, syriac, language, the, seventh, the, shabuhragan, was, written, by, mani, in, middle, persian, and, presented, by, him, to, sasanian, emperor, shapur, i, although, there, is, no, proof, shapur, i, was, a, manichaean, he, tolerated, the, spread, of, manichaeism, and, refrained, from, persecuting, it, within, his, empire, s, boundaries, according, to, one, tradition, mani, invented, the, unique, version, of, the, syriac, script, known, as, the, manichaean, alphabet, that, was, used, in, all, of, the, manichaean, works, written, within, the, sasanian, empire, whether, they, were, in, syriac, or, middle, persian, as, well, as, most, of, the, works, written, within, the, uyghur, khaganate, the, primary, language, of, babylon, and, the, administrative, and, cultural, language, of, the, empire, at, that, time, was, eastern, middle, aramaic, which, included, three, main, dialects, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, the, language, of, the, babylonian, talmud, mandaean, the, language, of, mandaeism, and, syriac, which, was, the, language, of, mani, as, well, as, the, syriac, christians, while, manichaeism, was, spreading, existing, religions, such, as, zoroastrianism, were, still, popular, and, christianity, was, gaining, social, and, political, influence, although, having, fewer, adherents, manichaeism, won, the, support, of, many, high, ranking, political, figures, with, the, assistance, of, the, sasanian, empire, mani, began, missionary, expeditions, after, failing, to, win, the, favour, of, the, next, generation, of, persian, royalty, and, incurring, the, disapproval, of, the, zoroastrian, clergy, mani, is, reported, to, have, died, in, prison, awaiting, execution, by, persian, emperor, bahram, i, the, date, of, his, death, is, estimated, at, 276, 277, ce, mani, believed, that, the, teachings, of, buddha, zoroaster, and, jesus, were, incomplete, and, that, his, revelations, were, for, the, entire, world, calling, his, teachings, the, religion, of, light, manichaean, writings, indicate, that, mani, received, revelations, when, he, was, twelve, years, old, and, again, when, he, was, 24, and, over, this, period, he, grew, dissatisfied, with, the, elcesaites, the, jewish, christian, gnostic, sect, he, was, born, into, some, researchers, also, point, to, an, important, jain, influence, on, mani, as, extreme, degrees, of, asceticism, and, some, specific, features, of, jain, doctrine, made, the, influence, of, mah, v, ra, s, religious, community, more, plausible, than, even, the, buddha, fynes, 1996, argues, that, various, jain, influences, particularly, ideas, on, the, existence, of, plant, souls, were, transmitted, from, western, kshatrapa, territories, to, mesopotamia, and, then, integrated, into, manichaean, beliefs, mani, wore, colorful, clothing, abnormal, for, the, time, that, reminded, some, romans, of, a, stereotypical, persian, magus, or, warlord, earning, him, ire, from, the, greco, roman, world, because, of, it, mani, taught, how, the, soul, of, a, righteous, individual, returns, to, paradise, upon, dying, but, the, soul, of, the, person, who, persisted, in, things, of, the, flesh, fornication, procreation, possessions, cultivation, harvesting, eating, of, meat, drinking, of, wine, is, condemned, to, rebirth, in, a, succession, of, bodies, mani, began, preaching, at, an, early, age, and, was, possibly, influenced, by, contemporary, babylonian, aramaic, movements, such, as, mandaeism, aramaic, translations, of, jewish, apocalyptic, works, similar, to, those, found, at, qumran, e, g, the, book, of, enoch, literature, and, by, the, syriac, dualist, gnostic, writer, bardaisan, who, lived, a, generation, before, mani, with, the, discovery, of, the, mani, codex, it, also, became, clear, that, he, was, raised, in, the, jewish, christian, sect, of, the, elcasaites, and, possibly, influenced, by, their, writings, according, to, biographies, preserved, by, ibn, al, nadim, and, the, persian, polymath, al, biruni, mani, received, a, revelation, as, a, youth, from, a, spirit, whom, he, would, later, call, his, twin, imperial, aramaic, t, wm, from, which, is, also, derived, the, greek, name, of, thomas, the, apostle, didymus, the, twin, syzygos, koin, greek, spouse, partner, in, the, cologne, mani, codex, double, protective, angel, or, divine, self, this, spirit, taught, him, wisdom, that, he, then, developed, into, a, religion, it, was, his, twin, who, brought, mani, to, self, realization, mani, claimed, to, be, the, paraclete, of, the, truth, promised, by, jesus, in, the, new, testament, manichaeism, s, views, on, jesus, are, described, by, historians, jesus, in, manichaeism, possessed, three, separate, identities, 1, jesus, the, luminous, 2, jesus, the, messiah, and, 3, jesus, patibilis, the, suffering, jesus, 1, as, jesus, the, luminous, his, primary, role, was, as, supreme, revealer, and, guide, and, it, was, he, who, woke, adam, from, his, slumber, and, revealed, to, him, the, divine, origins, of, his, soul, and, its, painful, captivity, by, the, body, and, mixture, with, matter, 2, jesus, the, messiah, was, an, historical, being, who, was, the, prophet, of, the, jews, and, the, forerunner, of, mani, however, the, manichaeans, believed, he, was, wholly, divine, and, that, he, never, experienced, human, birth, as, the, physical, realities, surrounding, the, notions, of, his, conception, and, his, birth, filled, the, manichaeans, with, horror, however, the, christian, doctrine, of, virgin, birth, was, also, regarded, as, obscene, since, jesus, the, messiah, was, the, light, of, the, world, where, was, this, light, they, reasoned, when, jesus, was, in, the, womb, of, the, virgin, jesus, the, messiah, they, believed, was, truly, born, only, at, his, baptism, as, it, was, on, that, occasion, that, the, father, openly, acknowledged, his, sonship, the, suffering, death, and, resurrection, of, this, jesus, were, in, appearance, only, as, they, had, no, salvific, value, but, were, an, exemplum, of, the, suffering, and, eventual, deliverance, of, the, human, soul, and, a, prefiguration, of, mani, s, own, martyrdom, 3, the, pain, suffered, by, the, imprisoned, light, particles, in, the, whole, of, the, visible, universe, on, the, other, hand, was, real, and, immanent, this, was, symbolized, by, the, mystic, placing, of, the, cross, whereby, the, wounds, of, the, passion, of, our, souls, are, set, forth, on, this, mystical, cross, of, light, was, suspended, the, suffering, jesus, jesus, patibilis, who, was, the, life, and, salvation, of, man, this, mystica, crucifixio, was, present, in, every, tree, herb, fruit, vegetable, and, even, stones, and, the, soil, this, constant, and, universal, suffering, of, the, captive, soul, is, exquisitely, expressed, in, one, of, the, coptic, manichaean, psalms, augustine, of, hippo, also, noted, that, mani, declared, himself, to, be, an, apostle, of, jesus, christ, manichaean, tradition, is, also, noted, to, have, claimed, that, mani, was, the, reincarnation, of, religious, figures, from, previous, eras, such, as, the, buddha, krishna, and, zoroaster, in, addition, to, jesus, himself, academics, note, that, much, of, what, is, known, about, manichaeism, comes, from, later, 10th, and, 11th, century, muslim, historians, like, al, biruni, and, ibn, al, nadim, in, his, al, fihrist, the, latter, ascribed, to, mani, the, claim, to, be, the, seal, of, the, prophets, however, given, the, islamic, milieu, of, arabia, and, persia, at, the, time, it, stands, to, reason, that, manichaens, would, regularly, assert, in, their, evangelism, that, mani, not, muhammad, was, the, seal, of, the, prophets, in, reality, for, mani, the, metaphorical, expression, seal, of, prophets, is, not, a, reference, to, his, finality, in, a, long, succession, of, prophets, as, it, is, used, in, islam, but, rather, as, final, to, his, followers, who, testify, or, attest, to, his, message, as, a, seal, other, sources, of, mani, s, scripture, were, the, aramaic, originals, of, the, book, of, enoch, 2, enoch, and, an, otherwise, unknown, section, of, the, book, of, enoch, entitled, the, book, of, giants, the, latter, was, quoted, directly, and, expanded, upon, by, mani, and, became, one, of, the, original, six, syriac, writings, of, the, manichaean, church, beside, brief, references, by, non, manichaean, authors, through, the, centuries, no, original, sources, of, the, book, of, giants, which, is, actually, part, six, of, the, book, of, enoch, were, available, until, the, 20th, century, scattered, fragments, of, both, the, original, aramaic, book, of, giants, which, were, analyzed, and, published, by, j, zef, milik, in, 1976, and, the, manichaean, version, of, the, same, name, analyzed, and, published, by, walter, bruno, henning, in, 1943, were, discovered, along, with, the, dead, sea, scrolls, in, the, judaean, desert, in, the, 20th, century, and, the, manichaean, writings, of, the, uyghur, manichaean, kingdom, in, turpan, henning, wrote, in, his, analysis, of, them, it, is, noteworthy, that, mani, who, was, brought, up, and, spent, most, of, his, life, in, a, province, of, the, persian, empire, and, whose, mother, belonged, to, a, famous, parthian, family, did, not, make, any, use, of, the, iranian, mythological, tradition, there, can, no, longer, be, any, doubt, that, the, iranian, names, of, s, m, nar, m, n, etc, that, appear, in, the, persian, and, sogdian, versions, of, the, book, of, the, giants, did, not, figure, in, the, original, edition, written, by, mani, in, the, syriac, language, by, comparing, the, cosmology, of, the, books, of, enoch, to, the, book, of, giants, as, well, as, the, description, of, the, manichaean, myth, scholars, have, observed, that, the, manichaean, cosmology, can, be, described, as, being, based, in, part, on, the, description, of, the, cosmology, developed, in, detail, within, the, enochic, literature, this, literature, describes, the, being, that, the, prophets, saw, in, their, ascent, to, heaven, as, a, king, who, sits, on, a, throne, at, the, highest, of, the, heavens, in, the, manichaean, description, this, being, the, great, king, of, honor, becomes, a, deity, who, guards, the, entrance, to, the, world, of, light, placed, at, the, seventh, of, ten, heavens, in, the, aramaic, book, of, enoch, the, qumran, writings, overall, and, in, the, original, syriac, section, of, manichaean, scriptures, quoted, by, theodore, bar, konai, he, is, called, malk, rabb, d, iq, r, the, great, king, of, honor, mani, was, also, influenced, by, writings, of, the, gnostic, bardaisan, 154, 222, ce, who, like, mani, wrote, in, syriac, and, presented, a, dualistic, interpretation, of, the, world, in, terms, of, light, and, darkness, in, combination, with, elements, from, christianity, mani, was, heavily, inspired, by, iranian, zoroastrian, theology, noting, mani, s, travels, to, the, kushan, empire, several, religious, paintings, in, bamyan, are, attributed, to, him, at, the, beginning, of, his, proselytizing, career, richard, foltz, postulates, buddhist, influences, in, manichaeism, buddhist, influences, were, significant, in, the, formation, of, mani, s, religious, thought, the, transmigration, of, souls, became, a, manichaean, belief, and, the, quadripartite, structure, of, the, manichaean, community, divided, between, male, and, female, monks, the, elect, and, lay, followers, the, hearers, who, supported, them, appears, to, be, based, on, that, of, the, buddhist, sangha, the, kushan, monk, lokak, ema, began, translating, pure, land, buddhist, texts, into, chinese, in, the, century, prior, to, mani, arriving, there, and, the, chinese, texts, of, manichaeism, are, full, of, uniquely, buddhist, terms, taken, directly, from, these, chinese, pure, land, scriptures, including, the, term, pure, land, chinese, pinyin, j, ngt, itself, however, the, central, object, of, veneration, in, pure, land, buddhism, amit, bha, the, buddha, of, infinite, light, does, not, appear, in, chinese, manichaeism, and, seems, to, have, been, replaced, by, another, deity, manichaeism, reached, rome, through, the, apostle, psattiq, by, 280, who, was, also, in, egypt, in, 244, and, 251, it, was, flourishing, in, the, faiyum, in, 290, manichaean, monasteries, existed, in, rome, in, 312, during, the, time, of, pope, miltiades, in, 291, persecution, arose, in, the, sasanian, empire, with, the, murder, of, the, apostle, sisin, by, emperor, bahram, ii, and, the, slaughter, of, many, manichaeans, then, in, 302, the, first, official, reaction, and, legislation, against, manichaeism, from, the, roman, state, was, issued, under, diocletian, in, an, official, edict, called, the, de, maleficiis, et, manichaeis, compiled, in, the, collatio, legum, mosaicarum, et, romanarum, and, addressed, to, the, proconsul, of, africa, diocletian, wrote, we, have, heard, that, the, manichaeans, have, set, up, new, and, hitherto, unheard, of, sects, in, opposition, to, the, older, creeds, so, that, they, might, cast, out, the, doctrines, vouchsafed, to, us, in, the, past, by, the, divine, favour, for, the, benefit, of, their, own, depraved, doctrine, they, have, sprung, forth, very, recently, like, new, and, unexpected, monstrosities, among, the, race, of, the, persians, a, nation, still, hostile, to, us, and, have, made, their, way, into, our, empire, where, they, are, committing, many, outrages, disturbing, the, tranquility, of, our, people, and, even, inflicting, grave, damage, to, the, civic, communities, we, have, cause, to, fear, that, with, the, passage, of, time, they, will, endeavour, as, usually, happens, to, infect, the, modest, and, tranquil, of, an, innocent, nature, with, the, damnable, customs, and, perverse, laws, of, the, persians, as, with, the, poison, of, a, malignant, serpent, we, order, that, the, authors, and, leaders, of, these, sects, be, subjected, to, severe, punishment, and, together, with, their, abominable, writings, burnt, in, the, flames, we, direct, their, followers, if, they, continue, recalcitrant, shall, suffer, capital, punishment, and, their, goods, be, forfeited, to, the, imperial, treasury, and, if, those, who, have, gone, over, to, that, hitherto, unheard, of, scandalous, and, wholly, infamous, creed, or, to, that, of, the, persians, are, persons, who, hold, public, office, or, are, of, any, rank, or, of, superior, social, status, you, will, see, to, it, that, their, estates, are, confiscated, and, the, offenders, sent, to, the, quarry, at, phaeno, or, the, mines, at, proconnesus, and, in, order, that, this, plague, of, iniquity, shall, be, completely, extirpated, from, this, our, most, happy, age, let, your, devotion, hasten, to, carry, out, our, orders, and, commands, by, 354, hilary, of, poitiers, wrote, that, manichaeism, was, a, significant, force, in, roman, gaul, in, 381, christians, requested, theodosius, i, to, strip, manichaeans, of, their, civil, rights, starting, in, 382, the, emperor, issued, a, series, of, edicts, to, suppress, manichaeism, and, punish, its, followers, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, converted, to, christianity, from, manichaeism, in, the, year, 387, this, was, shortly, after, the, roman, emperor, theodosius, i, had, issued, a, decree, of, death, for, all, manichaean, monks, in, 382, and, shortly, before, he, declared, christianity, to, be, the, only, legitimate, religion, for, the, roman, empire, in, 391, due, to, the, heavy, persecution, the, religion, almost, disappeared, from, western, europe, in, the, fifth, century, and, from, the, eastern, portion, of, the, empire, in, the, sixth, century, according, to, his, confessions, after, nine, or, ten, years, of, adhering, to, the, manichaean, faith, as, a, member, of, the, group, of, hearers, augustine, of, hippo, became, a, christian, and, a, potent, adversary, of, manichaeism, which, he, expressed, in, writing, against, his, manichaean, opponent, faustus, of, mileve, seeing, their, beliefs, that, knowledge, was, the, key, to, salvation, as, too, passive, and, not, able, to, affect, any, change, in, one, s, life, i, still, thought, that, it, is, not, we, who, sin, but, some, other, nature, that, sins, within, us, it, flattered, my, pride, to, think, that, i, incurred, no, guilt, and, when, i, did, wrong, not, to, confess, it, i, preferred, to, excuse, myself, and, blame, this, unknown, thing, which, was, in, me, but, was, not, part, of, me, the, truth, of, course, was, that, it, was, all, my, own, self, and, my, own, impiety, had, divided, me, against, myself, my, sin, was, all, the, more, incurable, because, i, did, not, think, myself, a, sinner, some, modern, scholars, have, suggested, that, manichaean, ways, of, thinking, influenced, the, development, of, some, of, augustine, s, ideas, such, as, the, nature, of, good, and, evil, the, idea, of, hell, the, separation, of, groups, into, elect, hearers, and, sinners, and, the, hostility, to, the, flesh, and, sexual, activity, and, his, dualistic, theology, some, sogdians, in, central, asia, believed, in, the, religion, uyghur, khagan, boku, tekin, 759, 780, converted, to, the, religion, in, 763, after, a, three, day, discussion, with, its, preachers, the, babylonian, headquarters, sent, high, rank, clerics, to, uyghur, and, manichaeism, remained, the, state, religion, for, about, a, century, before, the, collapse, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, in, 840, in, the, east, it, spread, along, trade, routes, as, far, as, chang, an, the, capital, of, tang, china, after, the, tang, dynasty, some, manichaean, groups, participated, in, peasant, movements, the, religion, was, used, by, many, rebel, leaders, to, mobilise, followers, in, song, and, yuan, china, remnants, of, manichaeism, continued, to, leave, a, legacy, contributing, to, sects, such, as, the, red, turbans, during, the, song, dynasty, the, manichaeans, were, derogatorily, referred, by, the, chinese, as, ch, c, i, sh, m, chinese, meaning, that, they, abstain, from, meat, and, worship, demons, an, account, in, fozu, tongji, an, important, historiography, of, buddhism, in, china, compiled, by, buddhist, scholars, during, 1258, 1269, says, that, the, manichaeans, worshipped, the, white, buddha, and, their, leader, wore, a, violet, headgear, while, the, followers, wore, white, costumes, many, manichaeans, took, part, in, rebellions, against, the, song, government, and, were, eventually, quelled, after, that, all, governments, were, suppressive, against, manichaeism, and, its, followers, and, the, religion, was, banned, in, ming, china, in, 1370, while, it, had, long, been, thought, that, manichaeism, arrived, in, china, only, at, the, end, of, the, seventh, century, a, recent, archaeological, discovery, demonstrated, that, it, was, already, known, there, in, the, second, half, of, the, 6th, century, the, nomadic, uyghur, khaganate, lasted, for, less, than, a, century, 744, 840, in, the, southern, siberian, steppe, with, the, fortified, city, of, ordu, baliq, on, the, upper, orkhon, river, as, its, capital, before, the, end, of, the, year, 763, manichaeism, was, declared, the, official, religion, of, the, uyghur, state, boku, tekin, banned, all, the, shamanistic, rituals, that, had, previously, been, in, use, it, is, likely, that, his, decision, was, accepted, by, his, subjects, that, much, results, from, a, report, that, the, proclamation, of, manichaeism, as, the, state, religion, was, met, with, enthusiasm, in, ordu, baliq, in, an, inscription, in, which, the, kaghan, speaks, for, himself, he, promised, to, the, manichaen, high, priests, the, elect, that, if, they, would, give, orders, he, would, promptly, follow, them, and, respond, to, their, requests, a, fragmentary, manuscript, found, in, the, turfan, oasis, gives, boku, tekin, the, title, of, zahag, i, mani, emanation, of, mani, or, descendant, of, mani, a, title, of, majestic, prestige, among, the, manichaeans, of, central, asia, nonetheless, and, despite, the, apparently, willing, conversion, of, the, uyghurs, to, manichaeanism, traces, and, signs, of, the, previous, shamanistic, practices, persisted, for, instance, in, 765, only, two, years, after, the, official, conversion, during, a, military, campaign, in, china, the, uyghur, troops, called, forth, magicians, to, perform, a, number, of, specific, rituals, manichaean, uyghurs, continued, to, treat, with, great, respect, a, sacred, forest, in, otuken, the, conversion, to, manichaeism, led, to, an, explosion, of, manuscript, production, in, the, tarim, basin, and, gansu, the, region, between, the, tibetan, and, the, huangtu, plateaus, which, lasted, well, into, the, early, 11th, century, in, 840, the, uyghur, khaghanate, collapsed, under, the, attacks, of, the, yenisei, kyrgyz, and, the, new, uyghur, state, of, qocho, was, established, with, a, capital, in, the, city, of, qocho, al, jahiz, 776, 868, or, 869, believed, that, the, peaceful, lifestyle, that, manicheism, brought, to, the, uyghurs, was, responsible, for, their, later, lack, of, military, skills, and, eventual, decline, this, however, is, contradicted, by, the, political, and, military, consequences, of, the, conversion, after, the, migration, of, the, uyghurs, to, turfan, in, ninth, century, the, nobility, maintained, manichaean, beliefs, for, a, while, before, converting, to, buddhism, traces, of, manicheism, among, the, uyghurs, in, turfan, may, be, detected, in, fragments, of, uyghur, manichaean, manuscripts, in, fact, manicheism, continued, to, rival, the, influence, of, buddhism, among, the, uyghurs, until, the, 13th, century, it, was, the, mongols, that, gave, the, final, blow, to, the, manichaeism, among, the, uyghurs, manichaeism, spread, to, tibet, during, the, tibetan, empire, there, was, a, serious, attempt, made, to, introduce, the, religion, to, the, tibetans, as, the, text, criteria, of, the, authentic, scriptures, a, text, attributed, to, tibetan, emperor, trisong, detsen, makes, a, great, effort, to, attack, manichaeism, by, stating, that, mani, was, a, heretic, who, engaged, in, religious, syncretism, into, a, deviating, and, inauthentic, form, manichaeans, in, iran, tried, to, assimilate, their, religion, along, with, islam, in, the, muslim, caliphates, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, religion, during, the, first, century, of, islamic, rule, during, the, early, caliphates, manichaeism, attracted, many, followers, it, had, a, significant, appeal, among, the, muslim, society, especially, among, the, elites, a, part, of, manichaeism, that, specifically, appealed, to, the, sasanians, was, the, names, of, the, manichaean, gods, the, names, mani, had, assigned, to, the, gods, of, his, religion, show, identification, with, those, of, the, zoroastrian, pantheon, even, though, some, divine, beings, he, incorporates, are, non, iranian, for, example, jesus, adam, or, eve, were, respectively, given, the, names, xradesahr, gehmurd, or, murdiyanag, because, of, these, familiar, names, manichaeism, did, not, feel, completely, foreign, to, the, zoroastrians, due, to, the, appeal, of, its, teachings, many, sasanians, adopted, the, ideas, of, its, theology, and, some, even, became, dualists, not, only, were, the, citizens, of, the, sasanian, empire, intrigued, by, manichaeism, but, so, was, the, ruler, at, the, time, of, its, introduction, sabuhr, l, as, the, denkard, states, sabuhr, the, first, king, of, kings, was, very, well, known, for, gaining, and, seeking, knowledge, of, any, kind, because, of, this, knowledge, mani, knew, that, sabuhr, would, lend, an, ear, to, his, teachings, and, accept, him, mani, had, specifically, stated, while, introducing, his, teachings, to, sabuhr, that, his, religion, should, be, seen, as, a, reform, of, zarathrusta, s, ancient, teachings, this, was, of, great, fascination, to, the, king, as, it, perfectly, fit, sabuhr, s, dream, of, creating, a, large, empire, that, incorporated, all, people, and, their, different, creeds, thus, manichaeism, became, popular, and, flourished, throughout, the, sasanian, empire, for, thirty, years, an, apologia, for, manichaeism, ascribed, to, ibn, al, muqaffa, defended, its, phantasmagorical, cosmogony, and, attacked, the, fideism, of, islam, and, other, monotheistic, religions, the, manichaeans, had, sufficient, structure, to, have, a, head, of, their, community, tolerance, towards, manichaeism, decreased, after, the, death, of, sabuhr, i, his, son, ohrmazd, who, became, king, still, allowed, for, manichaeism, in, the, empire, but, he, also, greatly, trusted, the, zoroastrian, priest, kirdir, after, ohrmazd, s, short, reign, his, oldest, brother, wahram, i, became, king, wahram, i, held, kirdir, in, high, esteem, as, well, and, he, also, held, much, different, religious, ideals, than, ohrmazd, and, his, father, sabuhr, i, due, to, influence, from, kirdir, zoroastrianism, was, strengthened, throughout, the, empire, which, in, turn, caused, manichaeism, to, be, diminished, and, weakened, wahram, sentenced, mani, to, prison, and, he, died, there, under, the, eighth, century, abbasid, caliphate, arabic, zind, q, and, the, adjectival, term, zandaqa, could, denote, many, different, things, though, it, seems, primarily, or, at, least, initially, to, have, signified, a, follower, of, manichaeism, however, its, true, meaning, is, not, known, in, the, ninth, century, it, is, reported, that, caliph, al, ma, mun, tolerated, a, community, of, manichaeans, during, the, early, abbasid, period, the, manichaeans, underwent, persecution, the, third, abbasid, caliph, al, mahdi, persecuted, the, manichaeans, establishing, an, inquisition, against, dualists, who, if, being, found, guilty, of, heresy, refused, to, renounce, their, beliefs, were, executed, their, persecution, was, finally, ended, in, 780s, by, harun, al, rashid, during, the, reign, of, the, caliph, al, muqtadir, many, manichaeans, fled, from, mesopotamia, to, khorasan, from, fear, of, persecution, and, the, base, of, the, religion, was, later, shifted, to, samarkand, the, first, indications, and, signs, of, manichaeism, in, bactria, were, actually, during, mani, s, lifetime, while, he, never, physically, traveled, there, he, did, send, a, disciple, by, the, name, of, mar, ammo, to, spread, his, word, mani, called, upon, mar, ammo, the, teacher, who, knew, the, parthian, language, and, script, and, was, well, acquainted, with, lords, and, ladies, and, with, many, nobles, in, those, places, mar, ammo, indeed, did, travel, to, the, old, parthian, lands, of, eastern, iran, which, bordered, bactria, a, translation, of, persian, texts, state, the, following, from, the, perspective, of, mar, ammo, they, had, arrived, at, the, watch, post, of, kush, n, bactria, then, the, spirit, of, the, border, of, the, eastern, province, appeared, in, the, shape, of, a, girl, and, he, the, spirit, asked, me, ammo, what, do, you, intend, from, where, have, you, come, i, said, i, am, a, believer, a, disciple, of, mani, the, apostle, that, spirit, said, i, do, not, receive, you, return, from, where, you, have, come, despite, the, initial, rejection, mar, ammo, faced, we, are, told, in, these, same, persian, texts, that, mani, s, spirit, appeared, to, mar, ammo, in, a, spirit, form, and, requested, him, to, persevere, and, read, the, chapter, the, collecting, of, the, gates, from, the, treasure, of, the, living, once, he, did, this, spirit, returned, converted, and, said, i, am, bag, ard, the, frontier, guard, of, the, eastern, province, when, i, receive, you, then, the, gate, of, the, whole, east, will, be, opened, in, front, of, you, it, seemed, that, this, border, spirit, was, a, reference, to, the, local, eastern, iranian, goddess, ard, oxsho, who, was, incredibly, prevalent, in, bactria, manichaeism, claimed, to, present, the, complete, version, of, teachings, that, were, corrupted, and, misinterpreted, by, the, followers, of, its, predecessors, adam, abraham, noah, zoroaster, the, buddha, and, jesus, accordingly, as, it, spread, it, adapted, new, deities, from, other, religions, into, forms, it, could, use, for, its, scriptures, its, original, eastern, middle, aramaic, texts, already, contained, stories, of, jesus, when, they, moved, eastward, and, were, translated, into, iranian, languages, the, names, of, the, manichaean, deities, or, angels, were, often, transformed, into, the, names, of, zoroastrian, yazatas, thus, abb, rabb, the, father, of, greatness, the, highest, manichaean, deity, of, light, in, middle, persian, texts, might, either, be, translated, literally, as, p, d, wuzurg, h, or, substituted, with, the, name, of, the, deity, zurw, n, similarly, the, manichaean, primal, figure, n, qa, m, y, the, original, man, was, rendered, ohrmazd, bay, after, the, zoroastrian, god, ohrmazd, this, process, continued, in, manichaeism, s, meeting, with, chinese, buddhism, where, for, example, the, original, aramaic, qary, the, call, from, the, world, of, light, to, those, seeking, rescue, from, the, world, of, darkness, is, identified, in, the, chinese, language, scriptures, with, guanyin, or, avalokite, vara, in, sanskrit, literally, watching, perceiving, sounds, the, bodhisattva, of, compassion, manichaeism, influenced, some, writing, and, traditions, of, proto, orthodox, and, other, forms, of, christianity, as, well, as, doing, the, same, for, branches, of, zoroastrianism, judaism, buddhism, and, islam, manichaeism, was, repressed, by, the, sasanian, empire, in, 291, persecution, arose, in, the, persian, empire, with, the, murder, of, the, apostle, sisin, by, bahram, ii, and, the, slaughter, of, many, manichaeans, in, 296, the, roman, emperor, diocletian, decreed, all, the, manichaean, leaders, to, be, burnt, alive, along, with, the, manichaean, scriptures, and, many, manichaeans, in, europe, and, north, africa, were, killed, it, was, not, until, 372, with, valentinian, i, and, valens, that, manichaeism, was, legislated, against, again, theodosius, i, issued, a, decree, of, death, for, all, manichaean, monks, in, 382, ad, the, religion, was, vigorously, attacked, and, persecuted, by, both, the, christian, church, and, the, roman, state, and, the, religion, almost, disappeared, from, western, europe, in, the, fifth, century, and, from, the, eastern, portion, of, the, empire, in, the, sixth, century, in, 732, emperor, xuanzong, of, tang, banned, any, chinese, from, converting, to, the, religion, saying, it, was, a, heretic, religion, that, was, confusing, people, by, claiming, to, be, buddhism, however, the, foreigners, who, followed, the, religion, were, allowed, to, practice, it, without, punishment, after, the, fall, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, in, 840, which, was, the, chief, patron, of, manichaeism, which, was, also, the, state, religion, of, the, khaganate, in, china, all, manichaean, temples, in, china, except, in, the, two, capitals, and, taiyuan, were, closed, down, and, never, reopened, since, these, temples, were, viewed, as, a, symbol, of, foreign, arrogance, by, the, chinese, see, cao, an, even, those, that, were, allowed, to, remain, open, did, not, for, long, the, manichaean, temples, were, attacked, by, chinese, people, who, burned, the, images, and, idols, of, these, temples, manichaean, priests, were, ordered, to, wear, hanfu, instead, of, their, traditional, clothing, which, was, viewed, as, un, chinese, in, 843, emperor, wuzong, of, tang, gave, the, order, to, kill, all, manichaean, clerics, as, part, of, the, huichang, persecution, of, buddhism, and, over, half, died, they, were, made, to, look, like, buddhists, by, the, authorities, their, heads, were, shaved, they, were, made, to, dress, like, buddhist, monks, and, then, killed, although, the, religion, was, mostly, forbidden, and, its, followers, persecuted, thereafter, in, china, it, survives, within, syncretic, sects, throughout, fujian, in, a, form, of, chinese, manichaeism, also, called, mingjiao, under, the, song, dynasty, its, followers, were, derogatorily, referred, to, with, the, chengyu, pinyin, ch, c, i, s, m, vegetarian, demon, worshippers, many, manichaeans, took, part, in, rebellions, against, the, song, dynasty, they, were, quelled, by, song, china, and, were, suppressed, and, persecuted, by, all, successive, governments, before, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, in, 1370, the, religion, was, banned, through, an, edict, of, the, ming, dynasty, whose, hongwu, emperor, had, a, personal, dislike, for, the, religion, its, core, teaching, influences, many, religious, sects, in, china, including, the, white, lotus, movement, according, to, wendy, doniger, manichaeism, may, have, continued, to, exist, in, the, xinjiang, region, until, the, mongol, conquest, in, the, 13th, century, manicheans, also, suffered, persecution, for, some, time, under, the, abbasid, caliphate, of, baghdad, in, 780, the, third, abbasid, caliph, al, mahdi, started, a, campaign, of, inquisition, against, those, who, were, dualist, heretics, or, manichaeans, called, the, zind, q, he, appointed, a, master, of, the, heretics, arabic, hib, al, zan, diqa, an, official, whose, task, was, to, pursue, and, investigate, suspected, dualists, who, were, then, examined, by, the, caliph, those, found, guilty, who, refused, to, abjure, their, beliefs, were, executed, this, persecution, continued, under, his, successor, caliph, al, hadi, and, continued, for, some, time, during, reign, of, harun, al, rashid, who, finally, abolished, it, and, ended, it, during, the, reign, of, the, 18th, abbasid, caliph, al, muqtadir, many, manichaeans, fled, from, mesopotamia, to, khorasan, from, fear, of, persecution, by, him, and, about, 500, of, them, assembled, in, samarkand, the, base, of, the, religion, was, later, shifted, to, this, city, which, became, their, new, patriarchate, manichaean, pamphlets, were, still, in, circulation, in, greek, in, 9th, century, byzantine, constantinople, as, the, patriarch, photios, summarizes, and, discusses, one, that, he, has, read, by, agapius, in, his, bibliotheca, during, the, middle, ages, several, movements, emerged, that, were, collectively, described, as, manichaean, by, the, catholic, church, and, persecuted, as, christian, heresies, through, the, establishment, of, the, inquisition, in, 1184, they, included, the, cathar, churches, of, western, europe, other, groups, sometimes, referred, to, as, neo, manichaean, were, the, paulician, movement, which, arose, in, armenia, and, the, bogomils, in, bulgaria, and, serbia, an, example, of, this, usage, can, be, found, in, the, published, edition, of, the, latin, cathar, text, the, liber, de, duobus, principiis, book, of, the, two, principles, which, was, described, as, neo, manichaean, by, its, publishers, as, there, is, no, presence, of, manichaean, mythology, or, church, terminology, in, the, writings, of, these, groups, there, has, been, some, dispute, among, historians, as, to, whether, these, groups, were, descendants, of, manichaeism, manichaeism, could, have, influenced, the, bogomils, paulicians, and, cathars, however, these, groups, left, few, records, and, the, link, between, them, and, manichaeans, is, tenuous, regardless, of, its, accuracy, the, charge, of, manichaeism, was, leveled, at, them, by, contemporary, orthodox, opponents, who, often, tried, to, make, contemporary, heresies, conform, to, those, combatted, by, the, church, fathers, whether, the, dualism, of, the, paulicians, bogomils, and, cathars, and, their, belief, that, the, world, was, created, by, a, satanic, demiurge, were, due, to, influence, from, manichaeism, is, impossible, to, determine, the, cathars, apparently, adopted, the, manichaean, principles, of, church, organization, priscillian, and, his, followers, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, manichaeism, the, manichaeans, preserved, many, apocryphal, christian, works, such, as, the, acts, of, thomas, that, would, otherwise, have, been, lost, some, sites, are, preserved, in, xinjiang, zhejiang, and, fujian, in, china, the, cao, an, temple, is, the, most, widely, known, and, best, preserved, manichaean, building, 256, 257, though, it, later, became, associated, with, buddhism, other, temples, in, china, associated, with, manichaeism, also, exist, such, as, the, xuanzhen, temple, noted, for, its, stele, chinese, manichaeans, continue, to, practice, the, faith, mainly, in, fujian, and, zhejiang, some, platforms, on, the, internet, and, social, media, are, trying, to, spread, some, of, its, teachings, some, people, are, registered, in, these, electronic, sources, and, some, scholars, and, students, in, the, field, of, religious, studies, and, the, arts, continue, to, study, manichaeism, mani, s, teaching, dealt, with, the, origin, of, evil, by, addressing, a, theoretical, part, of, the, problem, of, evil, denying, the, omnipotence, of, god, and, instead, postulating, two, opposite, powers, manichaean, theology, teaches, a, dualistic, view, of, good, and, evil, a, key, belief, in, manichaeism, is, that, the, powerful, though, not, omnipotent, good, power, god, was, opposed, by, the, eternal, evil, power, devil, humanity, the, world, and, the, soul, are, seen, as, the, by, product, of, the, battle, between, god, s, proxy, primal, man, and, the, devil, the, human, person, is, seen, as, a, battle, ground, for, these, powers, the, soul, defines, the, person, but, it, is, under, the, influence, of, both, light, and, dark, this, contention, plays, out, over, the, world, as, well, as, the, human, body, neither, the, earth, nor, the, flesh, were, seen, as, intrinsically, evil, but, rather, possessed, portions, of, both, light, and, dark, natural, phenomena, such, as, rain, were, seen, as, the, physical, manifestation, of, this, spiritual, contention, therefore, the, manichaean, view, explained, the, existence, of, evil, by, positing, a, flawed, creation, in, the, formation, of, which, god, took, no, part, and, which, constituted, rather, the, product, of, a, battle, by, the, devil, against, god, manichaeism, presents, an, elaborate, description, of, the, conflict, between, the, spiritual, world, of, light, and, the, material, world, of, darkness, the, beings, of, both, the, world, of, darkness, and, the, world, of, light, have, names, there, are, numerous, sources, for, the, details, of, the, manichaean, belief, these, two, portions, of, the, scriptures, are, probably, the, closest, thing, to, the, original, writings, in, their, original, languages, that, will, ever, be, available, these, are, the, syriac, quotation, by, the, church, of, the, east, christian, theodore, bar, konai, in, his, 8th, century, syriac, scholion, the, ketba, de, skolion, and, the, middle, persian, sections, of, mani, s, shabuhragan, discovered, at, turpan, a, summary, of, mani, s, teachings, prepared, for, shapur, i, from, these, and, other, sources, it, is, possible, to, derive, an, almost, complete, description, of, the, detailed, manichaean, vision, a, complete, list, of, manichaean, deities, is, outlined, below, according, to, mani, the, unfolding, of, the, universe, takes, place, with, three, creations, the, original, man, is, armed, with, five, different, shields, of, light, reflections, of, the, five, shekhinas, which, he, loses, to, the, forces, of, darkness, in, the, ensuing, battle, described, as, a, kind, of, bait, to, trick, the, forces, of, darkness, as, the, forces, of, darkness, greedily, consume, as, much, light, as, they, can, when, the, original, man, comes, to, he, is, trapped, among, the, forces, of, darkness, in, the, sixth, century, many, manichaeans, saw, the, earth, as, a, rectangular, parallelepiped, enclosed, by, walls, of, crystal, above, which, three, domes, existed, with, the, other, two, being, above, and, larger, than, the, first, one, and, second, one, respectively, these, represented, the, three, heavens, in, chaldean, religion, beginning, with, the, time, of, its, creation, by, mani, the, manichaean, religion, has, had, a, detailed, description, of, deities, and, events, that, took, place, within, the, manichaean, scheme, of, the, universe, in, every, language, and, region, that, manichaeism, spread, to, these, same, deities, reappear, whether, it, is, in, the, original, syriac, quoted, by, theodore, bar, konai, or, the, latin, terminology, given, by, saint, augustine, from, mani, s, epistola, fundamenti, or, the, persian, and, chinese, translations, found, as, manichaeism, spread, eastward, while, the, original, syriac, retained, the, original, description, that, mani, created, the, transformation, of, the, deities, through, other, languages, and, cultures, produced, incarnations, of, the, deities, not, implied, in, the, original, syriac, writings, chinese, translations, are, especially, syncretic, borrowing, and, adapting, terminology, common, in, chinese, buddhism, the, manichaean, church, was, divided, into, the, elect, who, had, taken, upon, themselves, the, vows, of, manichaeism, and, the, hearers, those, who, had, not, but, still, participated, in, the, church, the, elect, were, forbidden, to, consume, alcohol, and, meat, as, well, as, to, harvest, crops, or, prepare, food, due, to, mani, s, claim, that, harvesting, was, a, form, of, murder, against, plants, the, hearers, would, therefore, commit, the, sin, of, preparing, food, and, would, provide, it, to, the, elect, who, would, in, turn, pray, for, the, hearers, and, cleanse, them, of, these, sins, the, terms, for, these, divisions, were, already, common, since, the, days, of, early, christianity, however, it, had, a, different, meaning, in, christianity, in, chinese, writings, the, middle, persian, and, parthian, terms, are, transcribed, phonetically, instead, of, being, translated, into, chinese, these, were, recorded, by, augustine, of, hippo, evidently, from, manichaean, sources, manichaeans, observed, daily, prayers, either, four, for, the, hearers, or, seven, for, the, elect, the, sources, differ, about, the, exact, time, of, prayer, the, fihrist, by, al, nadim, points, them, after, noon, mid, afternoon, just, after, sunset, and, at, nightfall, al, biruni, places, the, prayers, at, dawn, sunrise, noon, and, nightfall, the, elect, additionally, pray, at, mid, afternoon, half, an, hour, after, nightfall, and, at, midnight, al, nadim, s, account, of, daily, prayers, is, probably, adjusted, to, coincide, with, the, public, prayers, for, the, muslims, while, al, biruni, s, report, may, reflect, an, older, tradition, unaffected, by, islam, when, al, nadim, s, account, of, daily, prayers, had, been, the, only, detailed, source, available, there, was, a, concern, that, these, practises, had, been, only, adapted, by, muslims, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, however, it, is, clear, that, the, arabic, text, provided, by, al, nadim, corresponds, with, the, descriptions, of, egyptian, texts, from, the, fourth, century, every, prayer, started, with, an, ablution, with, water, or, if, water, was, not, available, with, other, substances, comparable, to, ablution, in, islam, and, consisted, of, several, blessings, to, the, apostles, and, spirits, the, prayer, consisted, of, prostrating, oneself, to, the, ground, and, rising, again, twelve, times, during, every, prayer, during, day, manichaeans, turned, towards, the, sun, and, during, night, towards, the, moon, if, the, moon, is, not, visible, at, night, they, turned, towards, north, evident, from, faustus, of, mileve, celestial, bodies, are, not, the, subject, of, worship, themselves, but, are, ships, carrying, the, light, particles, of, the, world, to, the, supreme, god, who, cannot, be, seen, since, he, exists, beyond, time, and, space, and, also, the, dwelling, places, for, emanations, of, the, supreme, deity, such, as, jesus, the, splendour, according, to, the, writings, of, augustine, of, hippo, ten, prayers, were, performed, the, first, devoted, to, the, father, of, greatness, and, the, following, to, lesser, deities, spirits, and, angels, and, finally, towards, the, elect, in, order, to, be, freed, from, rebirth, and, pain, and, to, attain, peace, in, the, realm, of, light, comparably, in, the, uyghur, confession, four, prayers, are, directed, to, the, supreme, god, zrua, the, god, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, and, fivefold, god, and, the, buddhas, mani, wrote, seven, books, which, contained, the, teachings, of, the, religion, only, scattered, fragments, and, translations, of, the, originals, remain, most, having, been, discovered, in, egypt, and, turkistan, during, the, 20th, century, the, original, six, syriac, writings, are, not, preserved, although, their, syriac, names, have, been, there, are, also, fragments, and, quotations, from, them, a, long, quotation, preserved, by, the, eighth, century, nestorian, christian, author, theodore, bar, konai, shows, that, in, the, original, syriac, aramaic, writings, of, mani, there, was, no, influence, of, iranian, or, zoroastrian, terms, the, terms, for, the, manichaean, deities, in, the, original, syriac, writings, are, in, aramaic, the, adaptation, of, manichaeism, to, the, zoroastrian, religion, appears, to, have, begun, in, mani, s, lifetime, however, with, his, writing, of, the, middle, persian, shabuhragan, his, book, dedicated, to, the, sasanian, emperor, shapur, i, in, it, there, are, mentions, of, zoroastrian, divinities, such, as, ahura, mazda, angra, mainyu, and, z, manichaeism, is, often, presented, as, a, persian, religion, mostly, due, to, the, vast, number, of, middle, persian, parthian, and, sogdian, as, well, as, turkish, texts, discovered, by, german, researchers, near, turpan, in, what, is, now, xinjiang, china, during, the, early, 1900s, however, from, the, vantage, point, of, its, original, syriac, descriptions, as, quoted, by, theodore, bar, khonai, and, outlined, above, manichaeism, may, be, better, described, as, a, unique, phenomenon, of, aramaic, babylonia, occurring, in, proximity, to, two, other, new, aramaic, religious, phenomena, talmudic, judaism, and, mandaeism, which, also, appeared, in, babylonia, in, roughly, the, third, century, the, original, but, now, lost, six, sacred, books, of, manichaeism, were, composed, in, syriac, aramaic, and, translated, into, other, languages, to, help, spread, the, religion, as, they, spread, to, the, east, the, manichaean, writings, passed, through, middle, persian, parthian, sogdian, tocharian, and, ultimately, uyghur, and, chinese, translations, as, they, spread, to, the, west, they, were, translated, into, greek, coptic, and, latin, most, manichaean, texts, survived, only, as, coptic, and, medieval, chinese, translations, of, their, original, lost, versions, henning, describes, how, this, translation, process, evolved, and, influenced, the, manichaeans, of, central, asia, beyond, doubt, sogdian, was, the, national, language, of, the, majority, of, clerics, and, propagandists, of, the, manichaean, faith, in, central, asia, middle, persian, p, rs, g, and, to, a, lesser, degree, parthian, pahlav, n, g, occupied, the, position, held, by, latin, in, the, medieval, church, the, founder, of, manichaeism, had, employed, syriac, his, own, language, as, his, medium, but, conveniently, he, had, written, at, least, one, book, in, middle, persian, and, it, is, likely, that, he, himself, had, arranged, for, the, translation, of, some, or, all, of, his, numerous, writings, from, syriac, into, middle, persian, thus, the, eastern, manichaeans, found, themselves, entitled, to, dispense, with, the, study, of, mani, s, original, writings, and, to, continue, themselves, to, reading, the, middle, persian, edition, it, presented, small, difficulty, to, them, to, acquire, a, good, knowledge, of, the, middle, persian, language, owing, to, its, affinity, with, sogdian, in, later, centuries, as, manichaeism, passed, through, eastern, persian, speaking, lands, and, arrived, at, the, uyghur, khaganate, and, eventually, the, uyghur, kingdom, of, turpan, destroyed, around, 1335, middle, persian, and, parthian, prayers, fr, wan, or, furi, n, and, the, parthian, hymn, cycles, the, huw, dagm, n, and, angad, r, nan, created, by, mar, ammo, were, added, to, the, manichaean, writings, a, translation, of, a, collection, of, these, produced, the, manichaean, chinese, hymnscroll, chinese, pinyin, m, n, ji, o, xi, b, z, n, which, lieu, translates, as, hymns, for, the, lower, section, of, the, manichaean, religion, in, addition, to, containing, hymns, attributed, to, mani, it, contains, prayers, attributed, to, mani, s, earliest, disciples, including, m, r, zaku, m, r, ammo, and, m, r, s, sin, another, chinese, work, is, a, complete, translation, of, the, sermon, of, the, light, nous, presented, as, a, discussion, between, mani, and, his, disciple, adda, until, discoveries, in, the, 1900s, of, original, sources, the, only, sources, for, manichaeism, were, descriptions, and, quotations, from, non, manichaean, authors, either, christian, muslim, buddhist, or, zoroastrian, ones, while, often, criticizing, manichaeism, they, also, quoted, directly, from, manichaean, scriptures, this, enabled, isaac, de, beausobre, writing, in, the, 18th, century, to, create, a, comprehensive, work, on, manichaeism, relying, solely, on, anti, manichaean, sources, thus, quotations, and, descriptions, in, greek, and, arabic, have, long, been, known, to, scholars, as, have, the, long, quotations, in, latin, by, saint, augustine, and, the, extremely, important, quotation, in, syriac, by, theodore, bar, konai, eusebius, commented, as, follows, the, error, of, the, manichees, which, commenced, at, this, time, an, example, of, how, inaccurate, some, of, these, accounts, could, be, can, be, seen, in, the, account, of, the, origins, of, manichaeism, contained, in, the, acta, archelai, this, was, a, greek, anti, manichaean, work, written, before, 348, most, well, known, in, its, latin, version, which, was, regarded, as, an, accurate, account, of, manichaeism, until, refuted, by, isaac, de, beausobre, in, the, 18th, century, in, the, time, of, the, apostles, there, lived, a, man, named, scythianus, who, is, described, as, coming, from, scythia, and, also, as, being, a, saracen, by, race, ex, genere, saracenorum, he, settled, in, egypt, where, he, became, acquainted, with, the, wisdom, of, the, egyptians, and, invented, the, religious, system, that, was, afterwards, known, as, manichaeism, finally, he, emigrated, to, palestine, and, when, he, died, his, writings, passed, into, the, hands, of, his, sole, disciple, a, certain, terebinthus, the, latter, betook, himself, to, babylonia, assumed, the, name, of, budda, and, endeavoured, to, propagate, his, master, s, teaching, but, he, like, scythianus, gained, only, one, disciple, who, was, an, old, woman, after, a, while, he, died, in, consequence, of, a, fall, from, the, roof, of, a, house, and, the, books, that, he, had, inherited, from, scythianus, became, the, property, of, the, old, woman, who, on, her, death, bequeathed, them, to, a, young, man, named, corbicius, who, had, been, her, slave, corbicius, thereupon, changed, his, name, to, manes, studied, the, writings, of, scythianus, and, began, to, teach, the, doctrines, that, they, contained, with, many, additions, of, his, own, he, gained, three, disciples, named, thomas, addas, and, hermas, about, this, time, the, son, of, the, persian, king, fell, ill, and, manes, undertook, to, cure, him, the, prince, however, died, whereupon, manes, was, thrown, into, prison, he, succeeded, in, escaping, but, eventually, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, king, by, whose, order, he, was, flayed, and, his, corpse, was, hung, up, at, the, city, gate, a, a, bevan, who, quoted, this, story, commented, that, it, has, no, claim, to, be, considered, historical, according, to, hegemonius, portrayal, of, mani, the, evil, demiurge, who, created, the, world, was, the, jewish, yahweh, hegemonius, reports, that, mani, said, it, is, the, prince, of, darkness, who, spoke, with, moses, the, jews, and, their, priests, thus, the, christians, the, jews, and, the, pagans, are, involved, in, the, same, error, when, they, worship, this, god, for, he, leads, them, astray, in, the, lusts, he, taught, them, he, goes, on, to, state, now, he, who, spoke, with, moses, the, jews, and, the, priests, he, says, is, the, archont, of, darkness, and, the, christians, jews, and, pagans, ethnic, are, one, and, the, same, as, they, revere, the, same, god, for, in, his, aspirations, he, seduces, them, as, he, is, not, the, god, of, truth, and, so, therefore, all, those, who, put, their, hope, in, the, god, who, spoke, with, moses, and, the, prophets, have, this, in, store, for, themselves, namely, to, be, bound, with, him, because, they, did, not, put, their, hope, in, the, god, of, truth, for, that, one, spoke, with, them, only, according, to, their, own, aspirations, in, the, early, 1900s, original, manichaean, writings, started, to, come, to, light, when, german, scholars, led, by, albert, gr, nwedel, and, then, by, albert, von, le, coq, began, excavating, at, gaochang, the, ancient, site, of, the, manichaean, uyghur, kingdom, near, turpan, in, chinese, turkestan, destroyed, around, ad, 1300, while, most, of, the, writings, they, uncovered, were, in, very, poor, condition, there, were, still, hundreds, of, pages, of, manichaean, scriptures, written, in, three, iranian, languages, middle, persian, parthian, and, sogdian, and, old, uyghur, these, writings, were, taken, back, to, germany, and, were, analyzed, and, published, at, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, in, berlin, by, le, coq, and, others, such, as, friedrich, w, k, m, ller, and, walter, bruno, henning, while, the, vast, majority, of, these, writings, were, written, in, a, version, of, the, syriac, script, known, as, manichaean, script, the, german, researchers, perhaps, for, lack, of, suitable, fonts, published, most, of, them, using, the, hebrew, alphabet, which, could, easily, be, substituted, for, the, 22, syriac, letters, perhaps, the, most, comprehensive, of, these, publications, was, manichaeische, dogmatik, aus, chinesischen, und, iranischen, texten, manichaean, dogma, from, chinese, and, iranian, texts, by, ernst, waldschmidt, and, wolfgang, lentz, published, in, berlin, in, 1933, more, than, any, other, research, work, published, before, or, since, this, work, printed, and, then, discussed, the, original, key, manichaean, texts, in, the, original, scripts, and, consists, chiefly, of, sections, from, chinese, texts, and, middle, persian, and, parthian, texts, transcribed, with, the, hebrew, alphabet, after, the, nazi, party, gained, power, in, germany, the, manichaean, writings, continued, to, be, published, during, the, 1930s, but, the, publishers, no, longer, used, hebrew, letters, instead, transliterating, the, texts, into, latin, letters, additionally, in, 1930, german, researchers, in, egypt, found, a, large, body, of, manichaean, works, in, coptic, though, these, were, also, damaged, hundreds, of, complete, pages, survived, and, beginning, in, 1933, were, analyzed, and, published, in, berlin, before, world, war, ii, by, german, scholars, such, as, hans, jakob, polotsky, some, of, these, coptic, manichaean, writings, were, lost, during, the, war, after, the, success, of, the, german, researchers, french, scholars, visited, china, and, discovered, what, is, perhaps, the, most, complete, set, of, manichaean, writings, written, in, chinese, these, three, chinese, writings, all, found, at, the, mogao, caves, among, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, and, all, written, before, the, 9th, century, are, today, kept, in, london, paris, and, beijing, some, of, the, scholars, involved, with, their, initial, discovery, and, publication, were, douard, chavannes, paul, pelliot, and, aurel, stein, the, original, studies, and, analyses, of, these, writings, along, with, their, translations, first, appeared, in, french, english, and, german, before, and, after, world, war, ii, the, complete, chinese, texts, themselves, were, first, published, in, tokyo, japan, in, 1927, in, the, taish, tripi, aka, volume, 54, while, in, the, last, thirty, years, or, so, they, have, been, republished, in, both, germany, with, a, complete, translation, into, german, alongside, the, 1927, japanese, edition, and, china, the, japanese, publication, remains, the, standard, reference, for, the, chinese, texts, in, egypt, a, small, codex, was, found, and, became, known, through, antique, dealers, in, cairo, it, was, purchased, by, the, university, of, cologne, in, 1969, two, of, its, scientists, henrichs, and, koenen, produced, the, first, edition, known, since, as, the, cologne, mani, codex, which, was, published, in, four, articles, in, the, zeitschrift, f, r, papyrologie, und, epigraphik, the, ancient, papyrus, manuscript, contained, a, greek, text, describing, the, life, of, mani, thanks, to, this, discovery, much, more, is, known, about, the, man, who, founded, one, of, the, most, influential, world, religions, of, the, past, the, terms, manichaean, and, manichaeism, are, sometimes, used, figuratively, as, a, synonym, of, the, more, general, term, dualist, with, respect, to, a, philosophy, outlook, or, world, view, the, terms, are, often, used, to, suggest, that, the, world, view, in, question, simplistically, reduces, the, world, to, a, struggle, between, good, and, evil, for, example, zbigniew, brzezinski, used, the, phrase, manichaean, paranoia, in, reference, to, u, s, president, george, w, bush, s, world, view, in, the, daily, show, with, jon, stewart, 14, march, 2007, brzezinski, elaborated, that, he, meant, the, notion, that, he, is, leading, the, forces, of, good, against, the, axis, of, evil, author, and, journalist, glenn, greenwald, followed, up, on, the, theme, in, describing, bush, in, his, book, a, tragic, legacy, 2007, the, term, is, frequently, used, by, critics, to, describe, the, attitudes, and, foreign, policies, of, the, united, states, and, its, leaders, philosopher, frantz, fanon, frequently, invoked, the, concept, of, manicheanism, in, his, discussions, of, violence, between, colonizers, and, the, colonized, in, my, secret, history, author, paul, theroux, s, protagonist, defines, the, word, manichaean, for, the, protagonist, s, son, as, seeing, that, good, and, evil, are, mingled, before, explaining, the, word, to, his, son, the, protagonist, mentions, joseph, conrad, s, short, story, the, secret, sharer, at, least, twice, in, the, book, the, plot, of, which, also, examines, the, idea, of, the, duality, of, good, and, evil
