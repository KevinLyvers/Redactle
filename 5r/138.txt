antiquity, medieval, early, modern, modern, iran, india, east, asia, a, religious, experience, sometimes, known, as, a, spiritual, experience, sacred, experience, mystical, experience, is, a, subjective, experience, which, is, interpreted, within, a, religious, framework, the, concept, originated, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, defense, against, the, growing, rationalism, of, western, society, william, james, popularised, the, concept, in, some, religions, this, is, said, to, sometimes, result, in, unverified, personal, gnosis, many, religious, and, mystical, traditions, see, religious, experiences, particularly, the, knowledge, which, comes, with, them, as, revelations, caused, by, divine, agency, rather, than, ordinary, natural, processes, they, are, considered, real, encounters, with, god, or, gods, or, real, contact, with, higher, order, realities, of, which, humans, are, not, ordinarily, aware, skeptics, may, hold, that, religious, experience, is, an, evolved, feature, of, the, human, brain, amenable, to, normal, scientific, study, the, commonalities, and, differences, between, religious, experiences, across, different, cultures, have, enabled, scholars, to, categorize, them, for, academic, study, psychologist, and, philosopher, william, james, 1842, 1910, described, four, characteristics, of, mystical, experience, in, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, 1901, 1902, according, to, james, such, an, experience, is, the, german, philosopher, and, theologian, rudolf, otto, 1869, 1937, argues, that, there, is, one, common, factor, to, all, religious, experience, independent, of, the, cultural, background, in, his, book, the, idea, of, the, holy, 1923, he, identifies, this, factor, as, the, numinous, the, numinous, experience, has, two, aspects, the, numinous, experience, also, has, a, personal, quality, to, it, in, that, the, person, feels, to, be, in, communion, with, a, holy, other, otto, sees, the, numinous, as, the, only, possible, religious, experience, he, states, there, is, no, religion, in, which, it, does, not, live, as, the, real, innermost, core, and, without, it, no, religion, would, be, worthy, of, the, name, otto, does, not, take, any, other, kind, of, religious, experience, such, as, ecstasy, and, enthusiasm, seriously, and, is, of, the, opinion, that, they, belong, to, the, vestibule, of, religion, biblical, scholar, norman, habel, defines, religious, experiences, as, the, structured, way, in, which, a, believer, enters, into, a, relationship, with, or, gains, an, awareness, of, the, sacred, within, the, context, of, a, particular, religious, tradition, religious, experiences, are, by, their, very, nature, preternatural, that, is, out, of, the, ordinary, or, beyond, the, natural, order, of, things, they, may, be, difficult, to, distinguish, observationally, from, psychopathological, states, such, as, psychoses, or, other, forms, of, altered, awareness, not, all, preternatural, experiences, are, considered, to, be, religious, experiences, following, habel, s, definition, psychopathological, states, or, drug, induced, states, of, awareness, are, not, considered, to, be, religious, experiences, because, they, are, mostly, not, performed, within, the, context, of, a, particular, religious, tradition, moore, and, habel, identify, two, classes, of, religious, experiences, the, immediate, and, the, mediated, religious, experience, in, his, book, faith, and, reason, the, philosopher, richard, swinburne, formulated, five, categories, into, which, all, religious, experiences, fall, swinburne, also, suggested, two, principles, for, the, assessment, of, religious, experiences, the, notion, of, religious, experience, can, be, traced, back, to, william, james, who, used, the, term, religious, experience, in, his, book, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, it, is, considered, to, be, the, classic, work, in, the, field, and, references, to, james, ideas, are, common, at, professional, conferences, james, distinguished, between, institutional, religion, and, personal, religion, institutional, religion, refers, to, the, religious, group, or, organization, and, plays, an, important, part, in, a, society, s, culture, personal, religion, in, which, the, individual, has, mystical, experience, can, be, experienced, regardless, of, the, culture, the, origins, of, the, use, of, this, term, can, be, dated, further, back, in, the, 18th, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, several, historical, figures, put, forth, very, influential, views, that, religion, and, its, beliefs, can, be, grounded, in, experience, itself, while, kant, held, that, moral, experience, justified, religious, beliefs, john, wesley, in, addition, to, stressing, individual, moral, exertion, thought, that, the, religious, experiences, in, the, methodist, movement, paralleling, the, romantic, movement, were, foundational, to, religious, commitment, as, a, way, of, life, wayne, proudfoot, traces, the, roots, of, the, notion, of, religious, experience, to, the, german, theologian, friedrich, schleiermacher, 1768, 1834, who, argued, that, religion, is, based, on, a, feeling, of, the, infinite, the, notion, of, religious, experience, was, used, by, schleiermacher, and, albert, ritschl, to, defend, religion, against, the, growing, scientific, and, secular, critique, and, defend, the, view, that, human, moral, and, religious, experience, justifies, religious, beliefs, the, notion, of, religious, experience, was, adopted, by, many, scholars, of, religion, of, which, william, james, was, the, most, influential, a, broad, range, of, western, and, eastern, movements, have, incorporated, and, influenced, the, emergence, of, the, modern, notion, of, mystical, experience, such, as, the, perennial, philosophy, transcendentalism, universalism, the, theosophical, society, new, thought, neo, vedanta, and, buddhist, modernism, according, to, the, perennial, philosophy, the, mystical, experiences, in, all, religions, are, essentially, the, same, it, supposes, that, many, if, not, all, of, the, world, s, great, religions, have, arisen, around, the, teachings, of, mystics, including, buddha, jesus, lao, tze, and, krishna, it, also, sees, most, religious, traditions, describing, fundamental, mystical, experience, at, least, esoterically, a, major, proponent, in, the, 20th, century, was, aldous, huxley, who, was, heavily, influenced, in, his, description, by, vivekananda, s, neo, vedanta, and, the, idiosyncratic, version, of, zen, exported, to, the, west, by, d, t, suzuki, both, of, these, thinkers, expounded, their, versions, of, the, perennialist, thesis, which, they, originally, received, from, western, thinkers, and, theologians, s, ren, kierkegaard, argued, that, dying, to, the, world, and, possessions, is, a, foundational, aspect, of, religious, experience, in, christianity, transcendentalism, was, an, early, 19th, century, liberal, protestant, movement, which, was, rooted, in, english, and, german, romanticism, the, biblical, criticism, of, herder, and, schleiermacher, and, the, skepticism, of, hume, the, transcendentalists, emphasised, an, intuitive, experiential, approach, of, religion, following, schleiermacher, an, individual, s, intuition, of, truth, was, taken, as, the, criterion, for, truth, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, the, first, translations, of, hindu, texts, appeared, which, were, also, read, by, the, transcendentalists, and, influenced, their, thinking, they, also, endorsed, universalist, and, unitarianist, ideas, leading, to, unitarian, universalism, the, idea, that, there, must, be, truth, in, other, religions, as, well, since, a, loving, god, would, redeem, all, living, beings, not, just, christians, the, theosophical, society, was, formed, in, 1875, by, helena, blavatsky, henry, steel, olcott, william, quan, judge, and, others, to, advance, the, spiritual, principles, and, search, for, truth, known, as, theosophy, the, theosophical, society, has, been, highly, influential, in, promoting, interest, both, in, west, and, east, in, a, great, variety, of, religious, teachings, no, single, organization, or, movement, has, contributed, so, many, components, to, the, new, age, movement, as, the, theosophical, society, it, has, been, the, major, force, in, the, dissemination, of, occult, literature, in, the, west, in, the, twentieth, century, the, theosophical, society, searched, for, secret, teachings, in, asian, religions, it, has, been, influential, on, modernist, streams, in, several, asian, religions, notably, hindu, reform, movements, the, revival, of, theravada, buddhism, and, d, t, suzuki, who, popularized, the, idea, of, enlightenment, as, insight, into, a, timeless, transcendent, reality, another, example, can, be, seen, in, paul, brunton, s, a, search, in, secret, india, which, introduced, ramana, maharshi, to, a, western, audience, the, interplay, between, western, and, eastern, notions, of, religion, is, an, important, factor, in, the, development, of, modern, mysticism, in, the, 19th, century, when, asian, countries, were, colonialised, by, western, states, a, process, of, cultural, mimesis, began, in, this, process, western, ideas, about, religion, especially, the, notion, of, religious, experience, were, introduced, to, asian, countries, by, missionaries, scholars, and, the, theosophical, society, and, amalgamated, in, a, new, understanding, of, the, indian, and, buddhist, traditions, this, amalgam, was, exported, back, to, the, west, as, authentic, asian, traditions, and, acquired, a, great, popularity, in, the, west, due, to, this, western, popularity, it, also, gained, authority, back, in, india, sri, lanka, and, japan, the, best, known, representatives, of, this, amalgamated, tradition, are, annie, besant, theosophical, society, swami, vivekenanda, and, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, neo, vedanta, anagarika, dharmapala, a, 19th, century, sri, lankan, buddhist, activist, who, founded, the, maha, bodhi, society, and, d, t, suzuki, a, japanese, scholar, and, zen, buddhist, a, synonymous, term, for, this, broad, understanding, is, nondualism, this, mutual, influence, is, also, known, as, the, pizza, effect, the, notion, of, experience, has, been, criticised, religious, empiricism, is, seen, as, highly, problematic, and, was, during, the, period, in, between, world, wars, famously, rejected, by, the, theologian, karl, barth, in, the, 20th, century, religious, as, well, as, moral, experience, as, justification, for, religious, beliefs, still, held, sway, some, influential, modern, scholars, who, held, this, liberal, theological, view, were, charles, raven, and, the, oxford, physicist, theologian, charles, coulson, robert, sharf, writes, that, experience, is, a, typical, western, term, which, has, found, its, way, into, asian, religiosity, via, western, influences, the, notion, of, experience, introduces, a, false, notion, of, duality, between, experiencer, and, experienced, whereas, the, essence, of, kensho, is, the, realisation, of, the, non, duality, of, observer, and, observed, pure, experience, does, not, exist, all, experience, is, mediated, by, intellectual, and, cognitive, activity, the, specific, teachings, and, practices, of, a, specific, tradition, may, even, determine, what, experience, someone, has, which, means, that, this, experience, is, not, the, proof, of, the, teaching, but, a, result, of, the, teaching, a, pure, consciousness, without, concepts, reached, by, cleansing, the, doors, of, perception, would, be, an, overwhelming, chaos, of, sensory, input, without, coherence, the, american, scholar, of, religion, and, philosopher, of, social, science, jason, josephson, storm, has, also, critiqued, the, definition, and, category, of, religious, experience, especially, when, such, experiences, are, used, to, define, religion, he, compares, the, appeal, to, experience, to, define, religion, to, failed, attempts, to, defend, an, essentialist, definition, of, art, by, appeal, to, aesthetic, experience, and, implies, that, each, category, lacks, a, common, psychological, feature, across, all, such, experiences, by, which, they, may, be, defined, traditions, offer, a, wide, variety, of, religious, practices, to, induce, religious, experiences, religious, experiences, may, also, be, caused, by, the, use, of, entheogens, such, as, religious, experiences, may, have, neurophysiological, origins, these, are, studied, in, the, field, of, neurotheology, and, the, cognitive, science, of, religion, and, include, near, death, experiences, causes, may, be, neoplatonism, is, the, modern, term, for, a, school, of, religious, and, mystical, philosophy, that, took, shape, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, founded, by, plotinus, and, based, on, the, teachings, of, plato, and, earlier, platonists, neoplatonism, teaches, that, along, the, same, road, by, which, it, descended, the, soul, must, retrace, its, steps, back, to, the, supreme, good, it, must, first, of, all, return, to, itself, this, is, accomplished, by, the, practice, of, virtue, which, aims, at, likeness, to, god, and, leads, up, to, god, by, means, of, ascetic, observances, the, human, becomes, once, more, a, spiritual, and, enduring, being, free, from, all, sin, but, there, is, still, a, higher, attainment, it, is, not, enough, to, be, sinless, one, must, become, god, see, henosis, this, is, reached, through, contemplation, of, the, primeval, being, the, one, in, other, words, through, an, ecstatic, approach, to, it, it, is, only, in, a, state, of, perfect, passivity, and, repose, that, the, soul, can, recognize, and, touch, the, primeval, being, hence, the, soul, must, first, pass, through, a, spiritual, curriculum, beginning, with, the, contemplation, of, corporeal, things, in, their, multiplicity, and, harmony, it, then, retires, upon, itself, and, withdraws, into, the, depths, of, its, own, being, rising, thence, to, the, nous, the, world, of, ideas, but, even, there, it, does, not, find, the, highest, the, one, it, still, hears, a, voice, saying, not, we, have, made, ourselves, the, last, stage, is, reached, when, in, the, highest, tension, and, concentration, beholding, in, silence, and, utter, forgetfulness, of, all, things, it, is, able, as, it, were, to, lose, itself, then, it, may, see, god, the, foundation, of, life, the, source, of, being, the, origin, of, all, good, the, root, of, the, soul, in, that, moment, it, enjoys, the, highest, indescribable, bliss, it, is, as, it, were, swallowed, up, of, divinity, bathed, in, the, light, of, eternity, porphyry, tells, us, that, on, four, occasions, during, the, six, years, of, their, intercourse, plotinus, attained, to, this, ecstatic, union, with, god, the, twelfth, step, of, the, alcoholics, anonymous, program, states, that, having, had, a, spiritual, awakening, as, the, result, of, these, steps, we, tried, to, carry, this, message, to, alcoholics, and, to, practice, these, principles, in, all, our, affairs, the, terms, spiritual, experience, and, spiritual, awakening, are, used, many, times, in, the, big, book, of, alcoholics, anonymous, which, argues, that, a, spiritual, experience, is, needed, to, bring, about, recovery, from, alcoholism, in, evangelical, christianity, becoming, born, again, is, understood, to, be, essential, for, a, believer, to, enter, heaven, upon, death, the, effect, is, life, changing, and, can, also, be, called, a, conversion, experience, noting, that, religious, experience, should, not, be, separated, from, care, for, one, s, neighbour, pope, francis, has, observed, that, there, can, be, no, true, religious, experience, that, is, deaf, to, the, cry, of, the, world, christian, doctrine, generally, maintains, that, god, dwells, in, all, christians, and, that, they, can, experience, god, directly, through, belief, in, jesus, christian, mysticism, aspires, to, apprehend, spiritual, truths, inaccessible, through, intellectual, means, typically, by, emulation, of, christ, william, inge, divides, this, scala, perfectionis, into, three, stages, the, purgative, or, ascetic, stage, the, illuminative, or, contemplative, stage, and, the, third, unitive, stage, in, which, god, may, be, beheld, face, to, face, the, third, stage, usually, called, contemplation, in, the, western, tradition, refers, to, the, experience, of, oneself, as, united, with, god, in, some, way, the, experience, of, union, varies, but, it, is, first, and, foremost, always, associated, with, a, reuniting, with, divine, love, the, underlying, theme, here, is, that, god, the, perfect, goodness, is, known, or, experienced, at, least, as, much, by, the, heart, as, by, the, intellect, since, in, the, words, of, 1, john, 4, 16, god, is, love, and, he, who, abides, in, love, abides, in, god, and, god, in, him, some, approaches, to, classical, mysticism, would, consider, the, first, two, phases, as, preparatory, to, the, third, explicitly, mystical, experience, but, others, state, that, these, three, phases, overlap, and, intertwine, based, on, christ, s, injunction, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, to, go, into, your, closet, to, pray, hesychasm, in, tradition, has, been, the, process, of, retiring, inward, by, ceasing, to, register, the, senses, in, order, to, achieve, an, experiential, knowledge, of, god, see, theoria, the, highest, goal, of, the, hesychast, is, the, experiential, knowledge, of, god, in, the, 14th, century, the, possibility, of, this, experiential, knowledge, of, god, was, challenged, by, a, calabrian, monk, barlaam, who, although, he, was, formally, a, member, of, the, orthodox, church, had, been, trained, in, western, scholastic, theology, barlaam, asserted, that, our, knowledge, of, god, can, only, be, propositional, the, practice, of, the, hesychasts, was, defended, by, st, gregory, palamas, while, all, muslims, believe, that, they, are, on, the, pathway, to, god, and, will, become, close, to, god, in, paradise, after, death, and, after, the, final, judgment, sufis, believe, that, it, is, possible, to, become, close, to, god, and, to, experience, this, closeness, while, one, is, alive, the, tariqa, the, path, on, which, the, mystics, walk, has, been, defined, as, the, path, which, comes, out, of, the, shariah, for, the, main, road, is, called, shar, the, path, tariq, no, mystical, experience, can, be, realized, if, the, binding, injunctions, of, the, shariah, are, not, followed, faithfully, first, the, tariqa, however, is, narrower, and, more, difficult, to, walk, it, leads, the, adept, called, salik, wayfarer, in, his, suluk, wandering, through, different, stations, maqam, until, he, reaches, his, goal, the, perfect, tauhid, the, existential, confession, that, god, is, one, in, theravada, buddhism, practice, is, described, in, the, threefold, training, of, discipline, la, meditative, concentration, sam, dhi, and, transcendent, wisdom, praj, zen, buddhism, emphasises, the, sole, practice, of, meditation, while, vajrayana, buddhism, utilizes, a, wide, variety, of, practices, while, the, main, aim, of, meditation, and, prajna, is, to, let, go, of, attachments, it, may, also, result, in, a, comprehension, of, the, buddha, nature, and, the, inherent, lucidness, of, the, mind, different, varieties, of, religious, experience, are, described, in, detail, in, the, ra, gama, s, tra, in, its, section, on, the, fifty, skandha, maras, each, of, the, five, skandhas, has, ten, skandha, maras, associated, with, it, and, each, skandha, mara, is, described, in, detail, as, a, deviation, from, correct, sam, dhi, these, skandha, maras, are, also, known, as, the, fifty, skandha, demons, in, some, english, language, publications, it, is, also, believed, that, supernormal, abilities, are, developed, from, meditation, which, are, termed, higher, knowledge, abhij, or, spiritual, power, ddhi, one, early, description, found, in, the, samyutta, nikaya, which, mentions, abilities, such, as, he, goes, unhindered, through, a, wall, through, a, rampart, through, a, mountain, as, though, through, space, he, dives, in, and, out, of, the, earth, as, though, it, were, water, he, walks, on, water, without, sinking, as, though, it, were, earth, seated, cross, legged, he, travels, in, space, like, a, bird, with, his, hands, he, touches, and, strokes, the, moon, and, sun, so, powerful, and, mighty, he, exercises, mastery, with, the, body, as, far, as, the, brahm, world, building, on, european, philosophers, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, reduced, religion, to, the, core, experience, of, reality, in, its, fundamental, unity, according, to, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, hinduism, is, not, just, a, faith, it, is, the, union, of, reason, and, intuition, that, cannot, be, defined, but, is, only, to, be, experienced, this, emphasis, on, experience, as, validation, of, a, religious, worldview, is, a, modern, development, which, started, in, the, 19th, century, and, was, introduced, to, indian, thought, by, western, unitarian, missionaries, it, has, been, popularized, in, neo, vedanta, also, known, as, neo, hinduism, which, has, dominated, the, popular, understanding, of, hinduism, since, the, 19th, century, it, emphasizes, mysticism, swami, vivekananda, presented, the, teachings, of, neo, vedanta, as, radical, nondualism, unity, between, all, religions, and, all, persons, early, studies, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, attempted, to, use, eegs, to, study, brain, wave, patterns, correlated, with, spiritual, states, during, the, 1980s, dr, michael, persinger, stimulated, the, temporal, lobes, of, human, subjects, with, a, weak, magnetic, field, his, subjects, claimed, to, have, a, sensation, of, an, ethereal, presence, in, the, room, some, current, studies, use, neuroimaging, to, localize, brain, regions, active, or, differentially, active, during, religious, experiences, these, neuroimaging, studies, have, implicated, a, number, of, brain, regions, including, the, limbic, system, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, superior, parietal, lobe, and, caudate, nucleus, based, on, the, complex, nature, of, religious, experience, it, is, likely, that, they, are, mediated, by, an, interaction, of, neural, mechanisms, that, all, add, a, small, piece, to, the, overall, experience, neuroscience, of, religion, also, known, as, neurotheology, biotheology, or, spiritual, neuroscience, is, the, study, of, correlations, of, neural, phenomena, with, subjective, experiences, of, spirituality, and, hypotheses, to, explain, these, phenomena, proponents, of, neurotheology, claim, that, there, is, a, neurological, and, evolutionary, basis, for, subjective, experiences, traditionally, categorized, as, spiritual, or, religious, the, neuroscience, of, religion, takes, neural, correlates, as, the, basis, of, cognitive, functions, and, religious, experiences, these, religious, experiences, are, thereby, emergent, properties, of, neural, correlates, this, approach, does, not, necessitate, exclusion, of, the, self, but, interprets, the, self, as, influenced, or, otherwise, acted, upon, by, underlying, neural, mechanisms, proponents, argue, that, religious, experience, can, be, evoked, through, stimulus, of, specific, brain, regions, and, or, can, be, observed, through, measuring, increase, in, activity, of, specific, brain, regions, according, to, the, neurotheologist, andrew, b, newberg, and, two, colleagues, neurological, processes, which, are, driven, by, the, repetitive, rhythmic, stimulation, which, is, typical, of, human, ritual, and, which, contribute, to, the, delivery, of, transcendental, feelings, of, connection, to, a, universal, unity, they, posit, however, that, physical, stimulation, alone, is, not, sufficient, to, generate, transcendental, unitive, experiences, for, this, to, occur, they, say, there, must, be, a, blending, of, the, rhythmic, stimulation, with, ideas, once, this, occurs, ritual, turns, a, meaningful, idea, into, a, visceral, experience, moreover, they, say, that, humans, are, compelled, to, act, out, myths, by, the, biological, operations, of, the, brain, due, to, what, they, call, the, inbuilt, tendency, of, the, brain, to, turn, thoughts, into, actions, an, alternate, approach, is, influenced, by, personalism, and, exists, contra, parallel, to, the, reductionist, approach, it, focuses, on, the, self, as, the, object, of, interest, the, same, object, of, interest, as, in, religion, according, to, patrick, mcnamara, a, proponent, of, personalism, the, self, is, a, neural, entity, that, controls, rather, than, consists, of, the, cognitive, functions, being, processed, in, brain, regions, a, biological, basis, for, religious, experience, may, exist, references, to, the, supernatural, or, mythical, beings, first, appeared, approximately, 40, 000, years, ago, a, popular, theory, posits, that, dopaminergic, brain, systems, are, the, evolutionary, basis, for, human, intellect, and, more, specifically, abstract, reasoning, the, capacity, for, religious, thought, arises, from, the, capability, to, employ, abstract, reasoning, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, theory, that, abstract, reasoning, generally, or, with, regard, to, religious, thought, evolved, independent, of, the, dopaminergic, axis, religious, behavior, has, been, linked, to, extrapersonal, brain, systems, that, predominate, the, ventromedial, cortex, and, rely, heavily, on, dopaminergic, transmission, a, biphasic, effect, exists, with, regard, to, activation, of, the, dopaminergic, axis, and, or, ventromedial, cortex, while, mild, activation, can, evoke, a, perceived, understanding, of, the, supernatural, extreme, activation, can, lead, to, delusions, characteristic, of, psychosis, stress, can, cause, the, depletion, of, 5, hydroxytryptamine, also, referred, to, as, serotonin, the, ventromedial, 5, ht, axis, is, involved, in, peripersonal, activities, such, as, emotional, arousal, social, skills, and, visual, feedback, when, 5, ht, is, decreased, or, depleted, one, may, become, subject, to, incorrect, attributions, of, self, initiated, or, internally, generated, activity, e, g, hallucinations, a, 2011, paper, suggested, that, psychiatric, conditions, associated, with, psychotic, spectrum, symptoms, may, be, possible, explanations, for, revelatory, driven, experiences, and, activities, such, as, those, of, abraham, moses, jesus, and, saint, paul, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, has, become, a, popular, field, of, study, due, to, its, correlation, to, religious, experience, religious, experiences, and, hyperreligiosity, are, often, used, to, characterize, those, with, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, visionary, religious, experiences, and, momentary, lapses, of, consciousness, may, point, toward, a, diagnosis, of, geschwind, syndrome, more, generally, the, symptoms,
