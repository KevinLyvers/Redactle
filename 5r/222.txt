authoritatively, guided, by, the, bible, the, god, in, christianity, s, revelation, to, humanity, critics, of, the, conceptualization, of, evangelicalism, argue, that, it, is, too, broad, too, diverse, or, too, ill, defined, to, be, adequately, seen, as, a, movement, or, a, single, movement, the, theological, nature, of, evangelicalism, was, first, explored, during, the, protestant, reformation, in, 16th, century, europe, martin, luther, s, ninety, five, theses, in, 1517, emphasized, that, scripture, and, the, preaching, of, the, gospel, had, ultimate, authority, over, the, practices, of, the, church, the, origins, of, modern, evangelicalism, are, usually, traced, to, 1738, with, various, theological, streams, contributing, to, its, foundation, including, pietism, and, radical, pietism, puritanism, quakerism, and, moravianism, in, particular, its, bishop, nicolaus, zinzendorf, and, his, community, at, herrnhut, preeminently, john, wesley, and, other, early, methodists, were, at, the, root, of, sparking, this, new, movement, during, the, first, great, awakening, today, evangelicals, are, found, across, many, protestant, branches, as, well, as, in, various, denominations, around, the, world, not, subsumed, to, a, specific, branch, among, leaders, and, major, figures, of, the, evangelical, protestant, movement, were, nicolaus, zinzendorf, george, fox, john, wesley, george, whitefield, jonathan, edwards, billy, graham, bill, bright, harold, ockenga, gudina, tumsa, john, stott, francisco, olaz, bal, william, j, seymour, and, martyn, lloyd, jones, evangelicalism, has, long, had, a, presence, in, the, anglosphere, before, spreading, further, afield, in, the, 19th, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, movement, gained, significant, momentum, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, with, the, great, awakening, in, the, united, states, and, also, in, great, britain, s, reformations, as, of, 2016, there, were, an, estimated, 619, million, evangelicals, in, the, world, meaning, that, one, in, four, christians, would, be, classified, as, evangelical, the, united, states, has, the, largest, proportion, of, evangelicals, in, the, world, american, evangelicals, are, a, quarter, of, the, nation, s, population, and, its, single, largest, religious, group, as, a, transdenominational, praxis, evangelicals, may, be, found, in, nearly, every, protestant, denomination, and, tradition, particularly, within, the, reformed, continental, reformed, anglicanism, presbyterian, congregational, plymouth, brethren, baptist, methodist, wesleyan, arminian, lutheran, moravian, free, church, mennonite, quaker, pentecostal, charismatic, and, non, denominational, churches, the, word, evangelical, has, its, etymological, roots, in, the, greek, word, for, gospel, or, good, news, euangelion, from, eu, good, angel, the, stem, of, among, other, words, angelos, messenger, angel, and, the, neuter, suffix, ion, by, the, english, middle, ages, the, term, had, expanded, semantically, to, include, not, only, the, message, but, also, the, new, testament, which, contained, the, message, as, well, as, more, specifically, the, gospels, which, portray, the, life, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, the, first, published, use, of, evangelical, in, english, was, in, 1531, when, william, tyndale, wrote, he, exhorteth, them, to, proceed, constantly, in, the, evangelical, truth, one, year, later, thomas, more, wrote, the, earliest, recorded, use, in, reference, to, a, theological, distinction, when, he, spoke, of, tyndale, his, evangelical, brother, barns, during, the, reformation, protestant, theologians, embraced, the, term, as, referring, to, gospel, truth, martin, luther, referred, to, the, evangelische, kirche, evangelical, church, to, distinguish, protestants, from, catholics, in, the, catholic, church, into, the, 21st, century, evangelical, has, continued, in, use, as, a, synonym, for, mainline, protestant, in, continental, europe, this, usage, is, reflected, in, the, names, of, protestant, denominations, such, as, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, the, german, term, evangelisch, more, accurately, corresponds, to, the, broad, english, term, protestant, and, should, not, be, confused, with, the, narrower, german, term, evangelikal, or, the, term, pietistisch, a, term, etymologically, related, to, the, pietist, and, radical, pietist, movements, which, are, used, to, described, evangelicalism, in, the, sense, used, in, this, article, mainline, protestant, denominations, with, a, lutheran, or, semi, lutheran, background, like, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, canada, and, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, of, england, who, are, not, evangelical, in, the, evangelikal, sense, but, protestant, in, the, evangelisch, sense, have, translated, the, german, term, evangelisch, or, protestant, into, the, english, term, evangelical, although, the, two, german, words, have, different, meanings, in, other, parts, of, the, world, especially, in, the, english, speaking, world, evangelical, german, evangelikal, or, pietistisch, is, commonly, applied, to, describe, the, interdenominational, born, again, believing, movement, christian, historian, david, w, bebbington, writes, that, although, evangelical, with, a, lower, case, initial, is, occasionally, used, to, mean, of, the, gospel, the, term, evangelical, with, a, capital, letter, is, applied, to, any, aspect, of, the, movement, beginning, in, the, 1730s, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, evangelicalism, was, first, used, in, 1831, in, 1812, the, term, evangelicalism, appeared, in, the, history, of, lynn, by, william, richards, in, the, summer, of, 1811, the, term, evangelicalists, was, used, in, the, sin, and, danger, of, schism, by, rev, dr, andrew, burnaby, archdeacon, of, leicester, the, term, may, also, be, used, outside, any, religious, context, to, characterize, a, generic, missionary, reforming, or, redeeming, impulse, or, purpose, for, example, the, times, literary, supplement, refers, to, the, rise, and, fall, of, evangelical, fervor, within, the, socialist, movement, this, usage, refers, to, evangelism, rather, than, evangelicalism, as, discussed, here, though, sharing, an, etymology, and, conceptual, basis, the, words, have, diverged, significantly, in, meaning, one, influential, definition, of, evangelicalism, has, been, proposed, by, historian, david, bebbington, bebbington, notes, four, distinctive, aspects, of, evangelical, faith, conversionism, biblicism, crucicentrism, and, activism, noting, together, they, form, a, quadrilateral, of, priorities, that, is, the, basis, of, evangelicalism, conversionism, or, belief, in, the, necessity, of, being, born, again, has, been, a, constant, theme, of, evangelicalism, since, its, beginnings, to, evangelicals, the, central, message, of, the, gospel, is, justification, by, faith, in, christ, and, repentance, or, turning, away, from, sin, conversion, differentiates, the, christian, from, the, non, christian, and, the, change, in, life, it, leads, to, is, marked, by, both, a, rejection, of, sin, and, a, corresponding, personal, holiness, of, life, a, conversion, experience, can, be, emotional, including, grief, and, sorrow, for, sin, followed, by, great, relief, at, receiving, forgiveness, the, stress, on, conversion, differentiates, evangelicalism, from, other, forms, of, protestantism, by, the, associated, belief, that, an, assurance, will, accompany, conversion, among, evangelicals, individuals, have, testified, to, both, sudden, and, gradual, conversions, biblicism, is, reverence, for, the, bible, and, high, regard, for, biblical, authority, all, evangelicals, believe, in, biblical, inspiration, though, they, disagree, over, how, this, inspiration, should, be, defined, many, evangelicals, believe, in, biblical, inerrancy, while, other, evangelicals, believe, in, biblical, infallibility, crucicentrism, is, the, centrality, that, evangelicals, give, to, the, atonement, the, saving, death, and, the, resurrection, of, jesus, that, offers, forgiveness, of, sins, and, new, life, this, is, understood, most, commonly, in, terms, of, a, substitutionary, atonement, in, which, christ, died, as, a, substitute, for, sinful, humanity, by, taking, on, himself, the, guilt, and, punishment, for, sin, activism, describes, the, tendency, toward, active, expression, and, sharing, of, the, gospel, in, diverse, ways, that, include, preaching, and, social, action, this, aspect, of, evangelicalism, continues, to, be, seen, today, in, the, proliferation, of, evangelical, voluntary, religious, groups, and, parachurch, organizations, the, word, church, has, several, meanings, among, evangelicals, it, can, refer, to, the, universal, church, the, body, of, christ, including, all, christians, everywhere, it, can, also, refer, to, the, church, congregation, which, is, the, visible, representation, of, the, invisible, church, it, is, responsible, for, teaching, and, administering, the, sacraments, or, ordinances, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, but, some, evangelicals, also, count, footwashing, as, an, ordinance, as, well, many, evangelical, traditions, adhere, to, the, doctrine, of, the, believers, church, which, teaches, that, one, becomes, a, member, of, the, church, by, the, new, birth, and, profession, of, faith, this, originated, in, the, radical, reformation, with, anabaptists, but, is, held, by, denominations, that, practice, believer, s, baptism, evangelicals, in, the, anglican, methodist, and, reformed, traditions, practice, infant, baptism, as, one, s, initiation, into, the, community, of, faith, and, the, new, testament, counterpart, to, circumcision, while, also, stressing, the, necessity, of, personal, conversion, later, in, life, for, salvation, some, evangelical, denominations, operate, according, to, episcopal, polity, or, presbyterian, polity, however, the, most, common, form, of, church, government, within, evangelicalism, is, congregational, polity, this, is, especially, common, among, nondenominational, evangelical, churches, many, churches, are, members, of, a, national, and, international,

who, claim, that, homosexuality, is, the, cause, of, many, social, problems, such, as, terrorism, some, churches, have, a, conservative, moderate, position, although, they, do, not, approve, homosexual, practices, they, claim, to, show, sympathy, and, respect, for, homosexuals, some, evangelical, denominations, have, adopted, neutral, positions, leaving, the, choice, to, local, churches, to, decide, for, same, sex, marriage, there, are, some, international, evangelical, denominations, that, are, gay, friendly, christian, marriage, is, presented, by, some, churches, as, a, protection, against, sexual, misconduct, and, a, compulsory, step, to, obtain, a, position, of, responsibility, in, the, church, this, concept, however, has, been, challenged, by, numerous, sex, scandals, involving, married, evangelical, leaders, finally, evangelical, theologians, recalled, that, celibacy, should, be, more, valued, in, the, church, today, since, the, gift, of, celibacy, was, taught, and, lived, by, jesus, christ, and, paul, of, tarsus, for, a, majority, of, evangelical, christians, a, belief, in, biblical, inerrancy, ensures, that, the, miracles, described, in, the, bible, are,

miracles, and, faith, healing, in, certain, churches, a, special, place, is, thus, reserved, for, faith, healings, with, laying, on, of, hands, during, worship, services, or, for, evangelization, campaigns, faith, healing, or, divine, healing, is, considered, to, be, an, inheritance, of, jesus, acquired, by, his, death, and, resurrection, this, view, is, typically, ascribed, to, pentecostal, denominations, and, not, others, that, are, cessationist, believing, that, miraculous, gifts, have, ceased, in, terms, of, denominational, beliefs, regarding, science, and, the, origin, of, the, earth, and, human, life, some, evangelicals, support, young, earth, creationism, for, example, answers, in, genesis, founded, in, australia, in, 1986, is, an, evangelical, organization, that, seeks, to, defend, the, thesis, in, 2007, they, founded, the, creation, museum, in, petersburg, in, kentucky, and, in, 2016, the, ark, encounter, in, williamstown, since, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, literalist, creationism, has, been, abandoned, by, some, evangelicals, in, favor, of, intelligent, design, for, example, the, think, tank, discovery, institute, established, in, 1991, in, seattle, defends, this, thesis, other, evangelicals, who, accept, the, scientific, consensus, on, evolution, and, the, age, of, earth, believe, in, theistic, evolution, or, evolutionary, creation, the, notion, that, god, used, the, process, of, evolution, to, create, life, a, christian, organization, that, espouses, this, view, is, the, biologos, foundation, the, reformed, baptist, methodist, pentecostal, churches, of, christ, plymouth, brethren, charismatic, protestant, and, nondenominational, protestant, traditions, have, all, had, strong, influence, within, contemporary, evangelicalism, some, anabaptist, denominations, such, as, the, brethren, church, are, evangelical, and, some, lutherans, self, identify, as, evangelicals, there, are, also, evangelical, anglicans, and, quakers, in, the, early, 20th, century, evangelical, influence, declined, within, mainline, protestantism, and, christian, fundamentalism, developed, as, a, distinct, religious, movement, between, 1950, and, 2000, a, mainstream, evangelical, consensus, developed, that, sought, to, be, more, inclusive, and, more, culturally, relevant, than, fundamentalism, while, maintaining, theologically, conservative, protestant, teaching, according, to, brian, stanley, professor, of, world, christianity, this, new, postwar, consensus, is, termed, neoevangelicalism, the, new, evangelicalism, or, simply, evangelicalism, in, the, united, states, while, in, great, britain, and, in, other, english, speaking, countries, it, is, commonly, termed, conservative, evangelicalism, over, the, years, less, conservative, evangelicals, have, challenged, this, mainstream, consensus, to, varying, degrees, such, movements, have, been, classified, by, a, variety, of, labels, such, as, progressive, open, postconservative, and, postevangelical, outside, of, self, consciously, evangelical, denominations, there, is, a, broader, evangelical, streak, in, mainline, protestantism, mainline, protestant, churches, predominantly, have, a, liberal, theology, while, evangelical, churches, predominantly, have, a, fundamentalist, or, moderate, conservative, theology, some, commentators, have, complained, that, evangelicalism, as, a, movement, is, too, broad, and, its, definition, too, vague, to, be, of, any, practical, value, theologian, donald, dayton, has, called, for, a, moratorium, on, use, of, the, term, historian, d, g, hart, has, also, argued, that, evangelicalism, needs, to, be, relinquished, as, a, religious, identity, because, it, does, not, exist, christian, fundamentalism, has, been, called, a, subset, or, subspecies, of, evangelicalism, fundamentalism, regards, biblical, inerrancy, the, virgin, birth, of, jesus, penal, substitutionary, atonement, the, literal, resurrection, of, christ, and, the, second, coming, of, christ, as, fundamental, christian, doctrines, fundamentalism, arose, among, evangelicals, in, the, 1920s, primarily, as, an, american, phenomenon, but, with, counterparts, in, britain, and, british, empire, to, combat, modernist, or, liberal, theology, in, mainline, protestant, churches, failing, to, reform, the, mainline, churches, fundamentalists, separated, from, them, and, established, their, own, churches, refusing, to, participate, in, ecumenical, organizations, such, as, the, national, council, of, churches, founded, in, 1950, and, making, separatism, rigid, separation, from, nonfundamentalist, churches, and, their, culture, a, true, test, of, faith, most, fundamentalists, are, baptists, and, dispensationalist, or, pentecostals, and, charismatics, great, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, literal, interpretation, of, the, bible, as, the, primary, method, of, bible, study, as, well, as, the, biblical, inerrancy, and, the, infallibility, of, their, interpretation, mainstream, evangelicalism, is, historically, divided, between, two, main, orientations, confessionalism, and, revivalism, these, two, streams, have, been, critical, of, each, other, confessional, evangelicals, have, been, suspicious, of, unguarded, religious, experience, while, revivalist, evangelicals, have, been, critical, of, overly, intellectual, teaching, that, they, suspect, stifles, vibrant, spirituality, in, an, effort, to, broaden, their, appeal, many, contemporary, evangelical, congregations, intentionally, avoid, identifying, with, any, single, form, of, evangelicalism, these, generic, evangelicals, are, usually, theologically, and, socially, conservative, but, their, churches, often, present, themselves, as, nondenominational, or, if, a, denominational, member, strongly, deemphasize, its, ties, to, such, such, as, a, church, name, which, excludes, the, denominational, name, within, the, broader, evangelical, movement, in, the, words, of, albert, mohler, president, of, the, southern, baptist, theological, seminary, confessional, evangelicalism, refers, to, that, movement, of, christian, believers, who, seek, a, constant, convictional, continuity, with, the, theological, formulas, of, the, protestant, reformation, while, approving, of, the, evangelical, distinctions, proposed, by, bebbington, confessional, evangelicals, believe, that, authentic, evangelicalism, requires, more, concrete, definition, in, order, to, protect, the, movement, from, theological, liberalism, and, from, heresy, according, to, confessional, evangelicals, subscription, to, the, ecumenical, creeds, and, to, the, reformation, era, confessions, of, faith, such, as, the, confessions, of, the, reformed, churches, provides, such, protection, confessional, evangelicals, are, represented, by, conservative, presbyterian, churches, emphasizing, the, westminster, confession, certain, baptist, churches, that, emphasize, historic, baptist, confessions, such, as, the, second, london, confession, evangelical, anglicans, who, emphasize, the, thirty, nine, articles, such, as, in, the, anglican, diocese, of, sydney, australia, methodist, churches, that, adhere, to, the, articles, of, religion, and, some, confessional, lutherans, with, pietistic, convictions, the, emphasis, on, historic, protestant, orthodoxy, among,

by, revivalism, and, by, pietism, revivalist, evangelicals, are, represented, by, some, quarters, of, methodism, the, wesleyan, holiness, churches, the, pentecostal, and, charismatic, churches, some, anabaptist, churches, and, some, baptists, and, presbyterians, revivalist, evangelicals, tend, to, place, greater, emphasis, on, religious, experience, than, their, confessional, counterparts, evangelicals, dissatisfied, with, the, movement, s, fundamentalism, mainstream, have, been, variously, described, as, progressive, evangelicals, postconservative, evangelicals, open, evangelicals, and, postevangelicals, progressive, evangelicals, also, known, as, the, evangelical, left, share, theological, or, social, views, with, other, progressive, christians, while, also, identifying, with, evangelicalism, progressive, evangelicals, commonly, advocate, for, women, s, equality, pacifism, and, social, justice, as, described, by, baptist, theologian, roger, e, olson, postconservative, evangelicalism, is, a, theological, school, of, thought, that, adheres, to, the, four, marks, of, evangelicalism, while, being, less, rigid, and, more, inclusive, of, other, christians, according, to, olson, postconservatives, believe, that, doctrinal, truth, is, secondary, to, spiritual, experience, shaped, by, scripture, postconservative, evangelicals, seek, greater, dialogue, with, other, christian, traditions, and, support, the, development, of, a, multicultural, evangelical, theology, that, incorporates, the, voices, of, women, racial, minorities, and, christians, in, the, developing, world, some, postconservative, evangelicals, also, support, open, theism, and, the, possibility, of, near, universal, salvation, the, term, open, evangelical, refers, to, a, particular, christian, school, of, thought, or, churchmanship, primarily, in, great, britain, especially, in, the, church, of, england, open, evangelicals, describe, their, position, as, combining, a, traditional, evangelical, emphasis, on, the, nature, of, scriptural, authority, the, teaching, of, the, ecumenical, creeds, and, other, traditional, doctrinal, teachings, with, an, approach, towards, culture, and, other, theological, points, of, view, which, tends, to, be, more, inclusive, than, that, taken, by, other, evangelicals, some, open, evangelicals, aim, to, take, a, middle, position, between, conservative, and, charismatic, evangelicals, while, others, would, combine, conservative, theological, emphases, with, more, liberal, social, positions, british, author, dave, tomlinson, coined, the, phrase, postevangelical, to, describe, a, movement, comprising, various, trends, of, dissatisfaction, among, evangelicals, others, use, the, term, with, comparable, intent, often, to, distinguish, evangelicals, in, the, emerging, church, movement, from, postevangelicals, and, antievangelicals, tomlinson, argues, that, linguistically, the, distinction, resembles, the, one, that, sociologists, make, between, the, modern, and, postmodern, eras, evangelicalism, emerged, in, the, 18th, century, first, in, britain, and, its, north, american, colonies, nevertheless, there, were, earlier, developments, within, the, larger, protestant, world, that, preceded, and, influenced, the, later, evangelical, revivals, according, to, religion, scholar, randall, balmer, evangelicalism, resulted, from, the, confluence, of, pietism, presbyterianism, and, the, vestiges, of, puritanism, evangelicalism, picked, up, the, peculiar, characteristics, from, each, strain, warmhearted, spirituality, from, the, pietists, for, instance, doctrinal, precisionism, from, the, presbyterians, and, individualistic, introspection, from, the, puritans, historian, mark, noll, adds, to, this, list, high, church, anglicanism, which, contributed, to, evangelicalism, a, legacy, of, rigorous, spirituality, and, innovative, organization, historian, rick, kennedy, has, identified, new, england, puritan, clergyman, cotton, mather, as, the, first, american, evangelical, during, the, 17th, century, pietism, emerged, in, europe, as, a, movement, for, the, revival, of, piety, and, devotion, within, the, lutheran, church, as, a, protest, against, cold, orthodoxy, or, against, an, overly, formal, and, rational, christianity, pietists, advocated, for, an, experiential, religion, that, stressed, high, moral, standards, both, for, clergy, and, for, lay, people, the, movement, included, both, christians, who, remained, in, the, liturgical, state, churches, as, well, as, separatist, groups, who, rejected, the, use, of, baptismal, fonts, altars, pulpits, and, confessionals, as, radical, pietism, spread, the, movement, s, ideals, and, aspirations, influenced, and, were, absorbed, by, evangelicals, when, george, fox, who, is, considered, the, founder, of, quakerism, was, eleven, he, wrote, that, god, spoke, to, him, about, keeping, pure, and, being, faithful, to, god, and, man, after, being, troubled, when, his, friends, asked, him, to, drink, alcohol, with, them, at, the, age, of, nineteen, fox, spent, the, night, in, prayer, and, soon, afterwards, he, left, his, home, in, a, four, year, search, for, spiritual, satisfaction, in, his, journal, at, age, 23, he, believed, that, he, found, through, faith, in, jesus, christ, the, full, assurance, of, salvation, fox, began, to, spread, his, message, and, his, emphasis, on, the, necessity, of, an, inward, transformation, of, heart, as, well, as, the, possibility, of, christian, perfection, drew, opposition, from, english, clergy, and, laity, in, the, mid, 1600s, many, people, became, attracted, to, fox, s, preaching, and, his, followers, became, known, as, the, religious, society, of, friends, by, 1660, the, quakers, grew, to, 35, 000, and, while, the, two, movements, are, distinct, and, have, important, differences, like, the, doctrine, of, the, inward, light, they, are, considered, by, some, to, be, among, the, first, in, the, evangelical, christian, movement, the, presbyterian, heritage, not, only, gave, evangelicalism, a, commitment, to, protestant, orthodoxy, but, also, contributed, a, revival, tradition, that, stretched, back, to, the, 1620s, in, scotland, and, northern, ireland, central, to, this, tradition, was, the, communion, season, which, normally, occurred, in, the, summer, months, for, presbyterians, celebrations, of, holy, communion, were, infrequent, but, popular, events, preceded, by, several, sundays, of, preparatory, preaching, and, accompanied, with, preaching, singing, and, prayers, puritanism, combined, calvinism, with, a, doctrine, that, conversion, was, a, prerequisite, for, church, membership, and, with, an, emphasis, on, the, study, of, scripture, by, lay, people, it, took, root, in, the, colonies, of, new, england, where, the, congregational, church, became, an, established, religion, there, the, half, way, covenant, of, 1662, allowed, parents, who, had, not, testified, to, a, conversion, experience, to, have, their, children, baptized, while, reserving, holy, communion, for, converted, church, members, alone, by, the, 18th, century, puritanism, was, in, decline, and, many, ministers, expressed, alarm, at, the, loss, of, religious, piety, this, concern, over, declining, religious, commitment, led, many, people, to, support, evangelical, revival, high, church, anglicanism, also, exerted, influence, on, early, evangelicalism, high, churchmen, were, distinguished, by, their, desire, to, adhere, to, primitive, christianity, this, desire, included, imitating, the, faith, and, ascetic, practices, of, early, christians, as, well, as, regularly, partaking, of, holy, communion, high, churchmen, were, also, enthusiastic, organizers, of, voluntary, religious, societies, two, of, the, most, prominent, were, the, society, for, promoting, christian, knowledge, founded, in, london, in, 1698, which, distributed, bibles, and, other, literature, and, built, schools, and, the, society, for, the, propagation, of, the, gospel, in, foreign, parts, which, was, founded, in, england, in, 1701, to, facilitate, missionary, work, in, british, colonies, especially, among, colonists, in, north, america, samuel, and, susanna, wesley, the, parents, of, john, and, charles, wesley, born, 1703, and, 1707, respectively, were, both, devoted, advocates, of, high, church, ideas, in, the, 1730s, evangelicalism, emerged, as, a, distinct, phenomenon, out, of, religious, revivals, that, began, in, britain, and, new, england, while, religious, revivals, had, occurred, within, protestant, churches, in, the, past, the, evangelical, revivals, that, marked, the, 18th, century, were, more, intense, and, radical, evangelical, revivalism, imbued, ordinary, men, and, women, with, a, confidence, and, enthusiasm, for, sharing, the, gospel, and, converting, others, outside, of, the, control, of, established, churches, a, key, discontinuity, with, the, protestantism, of, the, previous, era, it, was, developments, in, the, doctrine, of, assurance, that, differentiated, evangelicalism, from, what, went, before, bebbington, says, the, dynamism, of, the, evangelical, movement, was, possible, only, because, its, adherents, were, assured, in, their, faith, he, goes, on, whereas, the, puritans, had, held, that, assurance, is, rare, late, and, the, fruit, of, struggle, in, the, experience, of, believers, the, evangelicals, believed, it, to, be, general, normally, given, at, conversion, and, the, result, of, simple, acceptance, of, the, gift, of, god, the, consequence, of, the, altered, form, of, the, doctrine, was, a, metamorphosis, in, the, nature, of, popular, protestantism, there, was, a, change, in, patterns, of, piety, affecting, devotional, and, practical, life, in, all, its, departments, the, shift, in, fact, was, responsible, for, creating, in, evangelicalism, a, new, movement, and, not, merely, a, variation, on, themes, heard, since, the, reformation, the, first, local, revival, occurred, in, northampton, massachusetts, under, the, leadership, of, congregationalist, minister, jonathan, edwards, in, the, fall, of, 1734, edwards, preached, a, sermon, series, on, justification, by, faith, alone, and, the, community, s, response, was, extraordinary, signs, of, religious, commitment, among, the, laity, increased, especially, among, the, town, s, young, people, the, revival, ultimately, spread, to, 25, communities, in, western, massachusetts, and, central, connecticut, until, it, began, to, wane, by, the, spring, of, 1735, edwards, was, heavily, influenced, by, pietism, so, much, so, that, one, historian, has, stressed, his, american, pietism, one, practice, clearly, copied, from, european, pietists, was, the, use, of, small, groups, divided, by, age, and, gender, which, met, in, private, homes, to, conserve, and, promote, the, fruits, of, revival, at, the, same, time, students, at, yale, university, at, that, time, yale, college, in, new, haven, connecticut, were, also, experiencing, revival, among, them, was, aaron, burr, sr, who, would, become, a, prominent, presbyterian, minister, and, future, president, of, princeton, university, in, new, jersey, gilbert, tennent, another, presbyterian, minister, was, preaching, the, evangelical, message, and, urging, the, presbyterian, church, to, stress, the, necessity, of, converted, ministers, the, spring, of, 1735, also, marked, important, events, in, england, and, wales, howell, harris, a, welsh, schoolteacher, had, a, conversion, experience, on, may, 25, during, a, communion, service, he, described, receiving, assurance, of, god, s, grace, after, a, period, of, fasting, self, examination, and, despair, over, his, sins, sometime, later, daniel, rowland, the, anglican, curate, of, llangeitho, wales, experienced, conversion, as, well, both, men, began, preaching, the, evangelical, message, to, large, audiences, becoming, leaders, of, the, welsh, methodist, revival, at, about, the, same, time, that, harris, experienced, conversion, in, wales, george, whitefield, was, converted, at, oxford, university, after, his, own, prolonged, spiritual, crisis, whitefield, later, remarked, about, this, time, god, was, pleased, to, enlighten, my, soul, and, bring, me, into, the, knowledge, of, his, free, grace, and, the, necessity, of, being, justified, in, his, sight, by, faith, only, whitefield, s, fellow, holy, club, member, and, spiritual, mentor, charles, wesley, reported, an, evangelical, conversion, in, 1738, in, the, same, week, charles, brother, and, future, founder, of, methodism, john, wesley, was, also, converted, after, a, long, period, of, inward, struggle, during, this, spiritual, crisis, john, wesley, was, directly, influenced, by, pietism, two, years, before, his, conversion, wesley, had, traveled, to, the, newly, established, colony, of, georgia, as, a, missionary, for, the, society, for, promoting, christian, knowledge, he, shared, his, voyage, with, a, group, of, moravian, brethren, led, by, august, gottlieb, spangenberg, the, moravians, faith, and, piety, deeply, impressed, wesley, especially, their, belief, that, it, was, a, normal, part, of, christian, life, to, have, an, assurance, of, one, s, salvation, wesley, recounted, the, following, exchange, with, spangenberg, on, february, 7, 1736, said, my, brother, i, must, first, ask, you, one, or, two, questions, have, you, the, witness, within, yourself, does, the, spirit, of, god, bear, witness, with, your, spirit, that, you, are, a, child, of, god, i, was, surprised, and, knew, not, what, to, answer, he, observed, it, and, asked, do, you, know, jesus, christ, i, paused, and, said, i, know, he, is, the, savior, of, the, world, true, he, replied, but, do, you, know, he, has, saved, you, i, answered, i, hope, he, has, died, to, save, me, he, only, added, do, you, know, yourself, i, said, i, do, but, i, fear, they, were, vain, words, wesley, finally, received, the, assurance, he, had, been, searching, for, at, a, meeting, of, a, religious, society, in, london, while, listening, to, a, reading, from, martin, luther, s, preface, to, the, epistle, to, the, romans, wesley, felt, spiritually, transformed, about, a, quarter, before, nine, while, was, describing, the, change, which, god, works, in, the, heart, through, faith, in, christ, i, felt, my, heart, strangely, warmed, i, felt, i, did, trust, in, christ, christ, alone, for, salvation, and, an, assurance, was, given, me, that, he, had, taken, away, my, sins, even, mine, and, saved, me, from, the, law, of, sin, and, death, pietism, continued, to, influence, wesley, who, had, translated, 33, pietist, hymns, from, german, to, english, numerous, german, pietist, hymns, became, part, of, the, english, evangelical, repertoire, by, 1737, whitefield, had, become, a, national, celebrity, in, england, where, his, preaching, drew, large, crowds, especially, in, london, where, the, fetter, lane, society, had, become, a, center, of, evangelical, activity, whitfield, joined, forces, with, edwards, to, fan, the, flame, of, revival, in, the, thirteen, colonies, in, 1739, 40, soon, the, first, great, awakening, stirred, protestants, throughout, america, evangelical, preachers, emphasized, personal, salvation, and, piety, more, than, ritual, and, tradition, pamphlets, and, printed, sermons, crisscrossed, the, atlantic, encouraging, the, revivalists, the, awakening, resulted, from, powerful, preaching, that, gave, listeners, a, sense, of, deep, personal, revelation, of, their, need, of, salvation, by, jesus, christ, pulling, away, from, ritual, and, ceremony, the, great, awakening, made, christianity, intensely, personal, to, the, average, person, by, fostering, a, deep, sense, of, spiritual, conviction, and, redemption, and, by, encouraging, introspection, and, a, commitment, to, a, new, standard, of, personal, morality, it, reached, people, who, were, already, church, members, it, changed, their, rituals, their, piety, and, their, self, awareness, to, the, evangelical, imperatives, of, reformation,

can, be, defined, in, terms, of, its, evangelicalism, its, insistence, on, the, literal, interpretation, of, scripture, its, recognition, of, stages, in, god, s, dealings, with, humanity, its, expectation, of, the, imminent, return, of, christ, to, rapture, his, saints, and, its, focus, on, both, apocalypticism, and, premillennialism, during, the, 19th, century, the, megachurches, churches,

church, in, the, united, states, of, america, evangelicalism, began, to, reassert, itself, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1930s, one, factor, was, the, advent, of, the, radio, as, a, means, of, mass, communication, when, began, his, old, fashioned, revival, hour, on, october, 3, 1937, he, sought, to, avoid, the, contentious, issues, that, had, caused, fundamentalists, to, be, characterized, as, narrow, one, hundred, forty, seven, representatives, from, thirty, four, denominations, met, from, april, 7, through, 9, 1942, in, st, louis, missouri, for, a, national, conference, for, united,

president, the, nae, was, partly, a, reaction, to, the, founding, of, the, american, council, of, christian, churches, accc, under, the, leadership, of, the, fundamentalist, carl, mcintire, the, accc, in, turn, had, been, founded, to, counter, the, influence, of, the, federal, council, of, churches, later, merged, into, the, national, council, of, churches, which, fundamentalists, saw, as, increasingly, embracing, modernism, in, its, ecumenism, those, who, established, the, nae, had, come, to, view, the, name, fundamentalist, as, an, embarrassment, instead, of, a, badge, of, honor, evangelical, revivalist, radio, preachers, organized, themselves, in, the, national, religious, broadcasters, in, 1944, in, order, to, regulate, their, activity, with, the, founding, of, the, nae, american, protestantism, was, divided, into, three, large, groups, the, fundamentalists, the, modernists, and, the, new, evangelicals, who, sought, to, position, themselves, between, the, other, two, in, 1947, harold, ockenga, coined, the, term, neo, evangelicalism, to, identify, a, movement, distinct, from, fundamentalism, the, neo, evangelicals, had, three, broad, characteristics, that, distinguished, them, from, the, conservative, fundamentalism, of, the, accc, each, of, these, characteristics, took, concrete, shape, by, the, mid, 1950s, in, 1947, carl, f, h, henry, s, book, the, uneasy, conscience, of, fundamentalism, called, on, evangelicals, to, engage, in, addressing, social, concerns, t, remains, true, that, the, evangelical, in, the, very, proportion, that, the, culture, in, which, he, lives, is, not, actually, christian, must, unite, with, non, evangelicals, for, social, betterment, if, it, is, to, be, achieved, at, all, simply, because, the, evangelical, forces, do, not, predominate, to, say, that, evangelicalism, should, not, voice, its, convictions, in, a, non, evangelical, environment, is, simply, to, rob, evangelicalism, of, its, missionary, vision, in, the, same, year, fuller, theological, seminary, was, established, with, ockenga, as, its, president, and, henry, as, the, head, of, its, theology, department, the, strongest, impetus, however, was, the, development, of, the, work, of, billy, graham, in, 1951, with, producer, dick, ross, he, founded, the, film, production, company, world, wide, pictures, graham, had, begun, his, career, with, the, support, of, mcintire, and, fellow, conservatives, bob, jones, sr, and, john, r, rice, however, in, broadening, the, reach, of, his, london, crusade, of, 1954, he, accepted, the, support, of, denominations, that, those, men, disapproved, of, when, he, went, even, further, in, his, 1957, new, york, crusade, conservatives, strongly, condemned, him, and, withdrew, their, support, according,
