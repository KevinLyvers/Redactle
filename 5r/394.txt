the, flood, are, unclear, because, the, portion, of, the, tablet, recording, the, beginning, of, the, story, has, been, destroyed, somehow, a, mortal, known, as, ziusudra, manages, to, survive, the, flood, likely, through, the, help, of, the, god, enki, the, tablet, begins, in, the, middle, of, the, description, of, the, flood, the, flood, lasts, for, seven, days, and, seven, nights, before, it,

epic, of, gilgamesh, enlil, actually, causes, the, flood, seeking, to, annihilate, every, living, thing, on, earth, because, the, humans, who, are, vastly, overpopulated, make, too, much, noise, and, prevent, him, from, sleeping, in, this, version, of, the, story, the, hero, is, utnapishtim, who, is, warned, ahead, of, time, by, ea, the, babylonian, equivalent, of, enki, that, the, flood, is, coming, the, flood, lasts, for, seven, days, when, it, ends, ishtar, who, had, mourned, the, destruction, of, humanity, promises, utnapishtim, that, enlil, will, never, cause, a, flood, again, when, enlil, sees, that, utnapishtim, and, his, family, have, survived, he, is, outraged, but, his, son, ninurta, speaks, up, in, favor, of, humanity, arguing, that, instead, of, causing, floods, enlil, should, simply, ensure, that, humans, never, become, overpopulated, by, reducing, their, numbers, using, wild, animals, and, famines, enlil, goes, into, the, boat, utnapishtim, and, his, wife, bow,
