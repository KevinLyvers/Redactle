satanism, refers, to, a, group, of, religious, ideological, and, or, philosophical, beliefs, based, on, satan, particularly, his, worship, or, veneration, satan, is, commonly, associated, with, the, devil, in, christianity, a, fallen, angel, often, regarded, as, chief, of, the, demons, who, tempt, humans, into, sin, the, phenomenon, of, satanism, shares, historical, connections, and, family, resemblances, with, the, left, hand, path, milieu, of, other, occult, figures, such, as, chaos, hecate, lilith, lucifer, and, set, for, centuries, the, term, was, used, by, various, christian, groups, as, an, accusation, against, ideological, opponents, a, slur, for, assorted, heretics, freethinkers, and, pagans, by, contrast, self, identified, satanism, is, a, relatively, modern, phenomenon, largely, attributed, to, the, 1966, founding, of, the, church, of, satan, by, anton, lavey, in, the, united, states, an, atheistic, group, that, does, not, believe, in, a, supernatural, satan, accusations, of, groups, engaged, in, devil, worship, have, echoed, throughout, much, of, christian, history, during, the, middle, ages, the, inquisition, led, by, the, catholic, church, alleged, that, various, heretical, christian, sects, and, groups, such, as, the, knights, templar, and, the, cathars, performed, secret, satanic, rituals, in, the, subsequent, early, modern, period, belief, in, a, widespread, satanic, conspiracy, of, witches, resulted, in, the, trials, and, executions, of, tens, of, thousands, of, alleged, witches, across, europe, and, the, north, american, colonies, peaking, between, 1560, 1630, ce, the, terms, satanist, and, satanism, emerged, during, the, reformation, and, counter, reformation, 1517, 1700, ce, as, both, catholics, and, protestants, accused, each, other, of, intentionally, being, in, league, with, satan, accusations, of, satanism, made, during, the, 18th, to, 20th, centuries, include, being, the, cause, of, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, the, evil, force, behind, freemasonry, and, an, unfounded, moral, panic, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, during, the, 1980s, and, 90s, since, the, 19th, century, various, small, religious, groups, have, emerged, that, identify, as, satanist, or, use, satanic, iconography, while, the, groups, that, appeared, after, the, 1960s, differed, greatly, they, can, be, broadly, divided, into, theistic, satanism, and, atheistic, satanism, those, venerating, satan, as, a, supernatural, deity, are, unlikely, to, ascribe, omnipotence, instead, relating, to, satan, as, a, patriarch, atheistic, satanists, regard, satan, as, a, symbol, of, certain, human, traits, a, useful, metaphor, without, ontological, reality, contemporary, religious, satanism, is, predominantly, an, american, phenomenon, though, the, rise, of, globalization, and, the, internet, have, seen, these, ideas, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, world, historical, and, anthropological, research, suggests, that, nearly, all, societies, have, developed, the, idea, of, a, sinister, and, anti, human, force, that, can, hide, itself, within, society, this, commonly, involves, a, belief, in, witches, a, group, of, individuals, who, invert, the, norms, of, their, society, and, seek, to, harm, their, community, for, instance, by, engaging, in, incest, murder, and, cannibalism, allegations, of, witchcraft, may, have, different, causes, and, serve, different, functions, within, a, society, for, instance, they, may, serve, to, uphold, social, norms, to, heighten, the, tension, in, existing, conflicts, between, individuals, or, to, scapegoat, certain, individuals, for, various, social, problems, another, contributing, factor, to, the, idea, of, satanism, is, the, concept, that, there, is, an, agent, of, misfortune, and, evil, who, operates, on, a, cosmic, scale, something, usually, associated, with, a, strong, form, of, ethical, dualism, that, divides, the, world, clearly, into, forces, of, good, and, forces, of, evil, the, earliest, such, entity, known, is, angra, mainyu, a, figure, that, appears, in, the, persian, religion, of, zoroastrianism, this, concept, was, also, embraced, by, judaism, and, early, christianity, and, although, it, was, soon, marginalized, within, jewish, thought, it, gained, increasing, importance, within, early, christian, understandings, of, the, cosmos, the, term, satan, has, evolved, from, a, hebrew, term, for, adversary, or, to, oppose, into, the, christian, figure, of, a, fallen, angel, who, tempts, mortals, into, sin, the, word, satan, was, not, originally, a, proper, name, but, rather, an, ordinary, noun, that, means, adversary, in, this, context, it, appears, at, several, points, in, the, old, testament, for, instance, in, the, book, of, samuel, david, is, presented, as, the, satan, adversary, of, the, philistines, while, in, the, book, of, numbers, the, term, appears, as, a, verb, when, jehovah, sent, an, angel, to, satan, to, oppose, balaam, prior, to, the, composition, of, the, new, testament, the, idea, developed, within, jewish, communities, that, satan, was, the, name, of, an, angel, who, had, rebelled, against, jehovah, and, had, been, cast, out, of, heaven, along, with, his, followers, this, account, would, be, incorporated, into, contemporary, texts, like, the, book, of, enoch, this, satan, was, then, featured, in, parts, of, the, new, testament, where, he, was, presented, as, a, figure, who, tempts, humans, to, commit, sin, in, the, book, of, matthew, and, the, book, of, luke, he, attempted, to, tempt, jesus, of, nazareth, as, the, latter, fasted, in, the, wilderness, while, the, early, christian, idea, of, the, devil, was, not, well, developed, it, gradually, adapted, and, expanded, through, the, creation, of, folklore, art, theological, treatises, and, morality, tales, thus, providing, the, character, with, a, range, of, extra, biblical, associations, beginning, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, concept, developed, in, christianity, of, the, devil, as, archrepresentative, of, evil, and, of, the, satanist, as, malign, mirror, image, of, the, good, christian, the, word, satanism, was, adopted, into, english, from, the, french, satanisme, the, terms, satanism, and, satanist, are, first, recorded, as, appearing, in, the, english, and, french, languages, during, the, sixteenth, century, when, they, were, used, by, christian, groups, to, attack, other, rival, christian, groups, in, a, roman, catholic, tract, of, 1565, the, author, condemns, the, heresies, blasphemies, and, sathanismes, of, the, protestants, in, an, anglican, work, of, 1559, anabaptists, and, other, protestant, sects, are, condemned, as, swarmes, of, satanistes, as, used, in, this, manner, the, term, satanism, was, not, used, to, claim, that, people, literally, worshipped, satan, but, instead, that, they, deviated, from, true, christianity, and, thus, were, serving, the, will, of, satan, during, the, nineteenth, century, the, term, satanism, began, to, be, used, to, describe, those, considered, to, lead, a, broadly, immoral, lifestyle, and, it, was, only, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, that, it, came, to, be, applied, in, english, to, individuals, who, were, believed, to, consciously, and, deliberately, venerate, satan, this, latter, meaning, had, appeared, earlier, in, the, swedish, language, the, lutheran, bishop, laurentius, paulinus, gothus, had, described, devil, worshipping, sorcerers, as, sathanister, in, his, ethica, christiana, produced, between, 1615, and, 1630, some, definitions, of, satanism, offered, suggested, by, scholars, include, but, these, definitions, of, satanism, are, limited, to, excluding, and, by, excluding, the, second, group, you, leave, out, most, of, the, history, of, satanism, joseph, p, laycock, argues, if, you, do, include, both, groups, you, have, two, sides, with, very, different, views, on, who, or, what, satan, was, is, and, represented, the, accusers, usually, follow, the, christian, idea, of, satan, as, an, irredeemably, evil, fallen, angel, who, seeks, the, destruction, of, both, god, and, humanity, but, who, along, with, his, followers, is, doomed, to, fail, and, to, suffer, eternal, punishment, while, the, self, identified, satanists, often, do, not, believe, that, satan, actually, exists, as, a, being, they, believe, he, is, a, symbol, and, a, promethean, figure, an, esoteric, symbol, of, a, vital, force, that, permeates, the, universe, let, alone, is, trying, to, destroy, humanity, a, definitions, descriptions, that, would, include, the, satanism, of, heresy, crusades, and, moral, panics, is, in, their, study, of, satanism, the, religious, studies, scholars, asbj, rn, dyrendal, james, r, lewis, and, jesper, aa, petersen, stated, that, the, term, satanism, has, a, history, of, being, a, designation, made, by, people, against, those, whom, they, dislike, it, is, a, term, used, for, othering, eugene, gallagher, noted, that, satanism, was, usually, a, polemical, not, a, descriptive, term, similar, to, the, way, certain, christian, denominations, accuse, each, other, of, heresy, different, satanic, groups, mainly, the, church, of, satan, cos, the, temple, of, set, tos, the, order, of, nine, angles, ona, and, the, satanic, temple, tst, often, accuse, one, another, of, being, fraudulent, satanists, and, or, ignorant, of, true, satanism, because, the, original, concept, of, satan, come, from, the, judeo, christian, heritage, and, because, satanists, almost, by, definition, oppose, the, teachings, of, those, religions, people, drawn, to, satanism, will, often, move, on, to, post, satanism, i, e, to, a, religion, that, does, not, declare, itself, satanic, but, includes, elements, of, satanism, e, g, temple, of, set, others, may, regards, themselves, as, satanists, but, promote, mythological, figures, and, traditions, outside, of, christianity, or, judaism, these, religions, are, sometimes, called, satanic, and, sometimes, post, satanic, diane, e, taub, and, lawrence, d, nelson, complain, that, satanism, is, frequently, defined, either, too, broadly, or, too, narrowly, with, accusers, sometimes, including, non, satanic, groups, like, santeria, witchcraft, eastern, religions, as, well, as, freemasonry, and, academics, for, example, carlson, and, larue, and, others, sometimes, restricting, its, definition, to, recognized, satanic, churches, and, their, members, excluding, those, who, believes, in, a, literal, satan, taub, and, nelson, define, satanism, as, the, literal, or, symbolic, worship, of, satan, the, enemy, of, the, judeo, christian, god, according, to, author, arthur, lyons, satanic, religions, are, as, old, as, monotheism, and, have, their, origins, in, persia, of, the, sixth, century, and, joe, carter, of, the, conservative, ecumenical, journal, first, things, writes, that, real, satanism, has, been, around, since, the, beginning, of, history, selling, an, appealing, message, your, eyes, will, be, opened, and, you, will, be, like, god, but, religious, scholar, joseph, laycock, writes, that, the, available, evidence, suggests, that, satanism, began, as, an, imaginary, religion, christians, invented, to, demonize, their, opponents, confessions, of, worship, of, satan, came, only, after, torture, or, other, forms, of, coercion, in, early, modern, europe, while, early, stories, of, satanic, activity, have, been, commonly, labeled, and, regarded, as, propaganda, based, on, falsehood, they, also, partially, shaped, the, beliefs, of, what, would, become, modern, religious, satanism, those, who, absorbed, and, accepted, the, tales, sometimes, began, to, imitate, them, celebrating, black, masses, for, example, a, process, known, to, folklorists, as, ostension, as, christianity, expanded, throughout, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, europe, it, came, into, contact, with, a, variety, of, other, religions, which, it, regarded, as, pagan, christianity, being, a, monotheist, religion, christian, theologians, believed, that, since, there, was, only, one, god, the, god, of, christianity, the, gods, and, goddesses, with, supernatural, powers, venerated, by, these, pagans, could, not, be, genuine, divinities, but, must, actually, be, demons, however, they, did, not, believe, that, pagans, were, deliberately, worshipping, devils, but, were, instead, simply, misguided, and, unaware, of, the, true, god, those, christian, groups, regarded, as, heretics, by, the, roman, catholic, church, were, treated, differently, with, theologians, arguing, that, they, were, deliberately, worshipping, the, devil, this, was, accompanied, by, claims, that, such, individuals, engaged, in, acts, of, evil, incestuous, sexual, orgies, the, murder, of, infants, and, cannibalism, all, stock, accusations, that, had, previously, been, leveled, at, christians, themselves, in, the, roman, empire, in, christian, iconography, the, devil, and, demons, were, given, the, physical, traits, of, figures, from, classical, mythology, such, as, the, god, pan, fauns, and, satyrs, the, first, recorded, example, of, such, an, accusation, being, made, within, western, christianity, took, place, in, toulouse, in, 1022, when, two, clerics, were, tried, for, allegedly, venerating, a, demon, throughout, the, middle, ages, this, accusation, would, be, applied, to, a, wide, range, of, christian, heretical, groups, including, the, paulicians, bogomils, cathars, waldensians, and, the, hussites, the, knights, templar, were, accused, of, worshipping, an, idol, known, as, baphomet, with, lucifer, having, appeared, at, their, meetings, in, the, form, of, a, cat, as, well, as, these, christian, groups, these, claims, were, also, made, about, europe, s, jewish, community, in, the, thirteenth, century, there, were, also, references, made, to, a, group, of, luciferians, led, by, a, woman, named, lucardis, which, hoped, to, see, satan, rule, in, heaven, references, to, this, group, continued, into, the, fourteenth, century, although, historians, studying, the, allegations, concur, that, these, luciferians, were, likely, a, fictitious, invention, within, christian, thought, the, idea, developed, that, certain, individuals, could, make, a, pact, with, satan, this, may, have, emerged, after, observing, that, pacts, with, gods, and, goddesses, played, a, role, in, various, pre, christian, belief, systems, or, that, such, pacts, were, also, made, as, part, of, the, christian, cult, of, saints, another, possibility, is, that, it, derives, from, a, misunderstanding, of, augustine, of, hippo, s, condemnation, of, augury, in, his, on, christian, doctrine, written, in, the, late, fourth, century, here, he, stated, that, people, who, consulted, augurs, were, entering, quasi, pacts, covenants, with, demons, the, idea, of, the, diabolical, pact, made, with, demons, was, popularized, across, europe, in, the, story, of, faust, likely, based, in, part, on, the, real, life, johann, georg, faust, as, the, late, medieval, gave, way, to, the, early, modern, period, european, christendom, experienced, a, schism, between, the, established, roman, catholic, church, and, the, breakaway, protestant, movement, in, the, ensuing, reformation, and, counter, reformation, 1517, 1700, ce, both, catholics, and, protestants, accused, each, other, of, deliberately, being, in, league, with, satan, it, was, in, this, context, that, the, terms, satanist, and, satanism, emerged, the, early, modern, period, also, saw, fear, of, satanists, reach, its, historical, apogee, in, the, form, of, the, witch, trials, of, the, fifteenth, to, the, eighteenth, centuries, when, between, 30, 000, and, 50, 000, alleged, witches, were, executed, this, came, about, as, the, accusations, which, had, been, leveled, at, medieval, heretics, among, them, that, of, devil, worship, were, applied, to, the, pre, existing, idea, of, the, witch, or, practitioner, of, malevolent, magic, the, idea, of, a, conspiracy, of, satanic, witches, was, developed, by, educated, elites, although, the, concept, of, malevolent, witchcraft, was, a, widespread, part, of, popular, belief, and, folkloric, ideas, about, the, night, witch, the, wild, hunt, and, the, dance, of, the, fairies, were, incorporated, into, it, the, earliest, trials, took, place, in, northern, italy, and, france, before, spreading, it, out, to, other, areas, of, europe, and, to, britain, s, north, american, colonies, being, carried, out, by, the, legal, authorities, in, both, catholic, and, protestant, regions, most, historians, agree, that, the, majority, of, those, persecuted, in, these, witch, trials, were, innocent, of, any, involvement, in, devil, worship, historian, darren, eldridge, writes, that, claims, that, there, actually, was, a, cult, of, devil, worshippers, being, pursued, by, witch, hunters, have, not, survived, the, scrutiny, of, surviving, trial, records, done, by, historians, from, 1962, 2012, however, in, their, summary, of, the, evidence, for, the, trials, the, historians, geoffrey, scarre, and, john, callow, thought, it, without, doubt, that, some, of, those, accused, in, the, trials, had, been, guilty, of, employing, magic, in, an, attempt, to, harm, their, enemies, and, were, thus, genuinely, guilty, of, witchcraft, in, a, scandal, starting, with, the, poisoning, of, three, people, prominent, members, of, the, french, aristocracy, including, members, of, the, king, s, inner, circle, were, implicated, and, sentenced, on, charges, of, poisoning, and, witchcraft, between, 1677, and, 1682, during, the, reign, of, king, louis, xiv, 36, people, were, executed, in, satanic, panic, known, to, history, as, the, affair, of, the, poisons, at, least, some, of, the, accusers, were, implicated, others, under, torture, and, in, hopes, of, saving, their, lives, these, highly, unreliable, reports, include, what, may, be, the, first, report, of, a, satanic, mass, using, a, woman, as, an, altar, the, enlightenment, and, scientific, revolution, changed, humanity, s, understanding, of, the, world, the, mathematics, of, isaac, newton, and, psychology, of, john, locke, left, little, space, for, the, intervention, of, supernatural, beings, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, undermined, the, doctrine, of, the, fall, in, the, garden, of, eden, and, the, role, of, the, diabolical, serpent, while, also, providing, an, alternative, account, of, human, evil, in, the, form, of, a, residual, effect, of, our, animal, nature, the, industrial, revolution, and, urbanization, disturbed, traditional, social, relations, and, folk, ideas, to, undermine, belief, in, witchcraft, and, the, devil, understanding, of, disorders, of, the, mind, undercut, demonic, possession, but, while, the, hunting, and, killing, of, alleged, witches, waned, belief, in, satan, did, not, disappear, during, the, eighteenth, century, gentleman, s, social, clubs, became, increasingly, prominent, in, britain, and, ireland, among, the, most, secretive, of, which, were, the, hellfire, clubs, which, were, first, reported, in, the, 1720s, the, most, famous, of, these, groups, was, the, order, of, the, knights, of, saint, francis, which, was, founded, circa, 1750, by, the, aristocrat, sir, francis, dashwood, and, which, assembled, first, at, his, estate, at, west, wycombe, and, later, in, medmenham, abbey, a, number, of, contemporary, press, sources, portrayed, these, as, gatherings, of, atheist, rakes, where, christianity, was, mocked, and, toasts, were, made, to, the, devil, beyond, these, sensationalist, accounts, which, may, not, be, accurate, portrayals, of, actual, events, little, is, known, about, the, activities, of, the, hellfire, clubs, introvigne, suggested, that, they, may, have, engaged, in, a, form, of, playful, satanism, in, which, satan, was, invoked, to, show, a, daring, contempt, for, conventional, morality, rather, than, to, pay, homage, to, him, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, dealt, a, blow, to, the, hegemony, of, the, roman, catholic, church, in, parts, of, europe, and, soon, a, number, of, catholic, authors, began, making, claims, that, it, had, been, masterminded, by, a, conspiratorial, group, of, satanists, among, the, first, to, do, so, was, french, catholic, priest, jean, baptiste, fiard, who, publicly, claimed, that, a, wide, range, of, individuals, from, the, jacobins, to, tarot, card, readers, were, part, of, a, satanic, conspiracy, fiard, s, ideas, were, furthered, by, alexis, vincent, charles, berbiguier, de, terre, neuve, du, thym, 1765, 1851, who, devoted, a, lengthy, book, to, this, conspiracy, theory, he, claimed, that, satanists, had, supernatural, powers, allowing, them, to, curse, people, and, to, shapeshift, into, both, cats, and, fleas, although, most, of, his, contemporaries, regarded, berbiguier, as, suffering, from, mental, illness, his, ideas, gained, credence, among, many, occultists, including, stanislas, de, guaita, a, cabalist, who, used, them, for, the, basis, of, his, book, the, temple, of, satan, a, reaction, to, this, was, the, taxil, hoax, in, 1890s, france, where, an, anti, clerical, writer, l, o, taxil, aka, marie, joseph, gabriel, antoine, jogand, pag, s, publicly, converted, to, catholicism, and, then, published, several, works, alleging, to, expose, the, satanic, doings, of, freemasons, in, 1897, taxil, called, a, press, conference, promising, to, introduce, a, key, character, of, his, stories, but, instead, announced, that, his, revelations, about, the, freemasons, were, made, up, and, thanked, the, catholic, clergy, for, helping, to, publicize, his, stories, nine, years, later, he, told, an, american, magazine, that, at, first, he, thought, readers, would, recognize, his, tales, as, obvious, nonsense, amusement, pure, and, simple, but, when, he, realized, they, believed, his, stories, and, that, there, was, lots, of, money, to, be, made, in, publishing, them, he, continued, to, perpetrate, the, hoax, around, the, same, time, another, convert, to, catholicism, joris, karl, huysmans, also, helped, promote, the, concept, of, active, satanist, groups, in, his, 1891, work, l, bas, down, there, huysmans, helped, to, cement, the, idea, the, black, mass, as, satanic, rite, and, inversion, of, the, roman, catholic, mass, with, a, naked, woman, for, an, altar, unlike, taxil, his, conversion, was, apparently, genuine, and, his, book, was, published, as, fiction, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, british, novelist, dennis, wheatley, produced, a, range, of, influential, novels, in, which, his, protagonists, battled, satanic, groups, at, the, same, time, non, fiction, authors, like, montague, summers, and, rollo, ahmed, published, books, claiming, that, satanic, groups, practicing, black, magic, were, still, active, across, the, world, although, they, provided, no, evidence, that, this, was, the, case, during, the, 1950s, various, british, tabloid, newspapers, repeated, such, claims, largely, basing, their, accounts, on, the, allegations, of, one, woman, sarah, jackson, who, claimed, to, have, been, a, member, of, such, a, group, in, 1973, the, british, christian, doreen, irvine, published, from, witchcraft, to, christ, in, which, she, claimed, to, have, been, a, member, of, a, satanic, group, that, gave, her, supernatural, powers, such, as, the, ability, to, levitate, before, she, escaped, and, embraced, christianity, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, various, christian, preachers, the, most, famous, being, mike, warnke, in, his, 1972, book, the, satan, seller, claimed, that, they, had, been, members, of, satanic, groups, who, carried, out, sex, rituals, and, animal, sacrifices, before, discovering, christianity, according, to, gareth, medway, in, his, historical, examination, of, satanism, these, stories, were, a, series, of, inventions, by, insecure, people, and, hack, writers, each, one, based, on, a, previous, story, exaggerated, a, little, more, each, time, other, publications, made, allegations, of, satanism, against, historical, figures, the, 1970s, saw, the, publication, of, the, romanian, protestant, preacher, richard, wurmbrand, s, book, in, which, he, argued, without, corroborating, evidence, that, the, socio, political, theorist, karl, marx, had, been, a, satanist, at, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, a, moral, panic, arose, from, claims, that, a, devil, worshipping, cult, was, committing, sexual, abuse, murder, and, cannibalism, in, its, rituals, and, including, children, among, the, victims, of, its, rites, initially, the, alleged, perpetrators, of, such, crimes, were, labeled, witches, although, the, term, satanist, was, soon, adopted, as, a, favored, alternative, and, the, phenomenon, itself, came, to, be, called, the, satanism, scare, those, active, in, the, scare, alleged, that, there, was, a, conspiracy, of, organized, satanists, who, occupied, prominent, positions, throughout, society, from, the, police, to, politicians, and, that, they, had, been, powerful, enough, to, cover, up, their, crimes, preceded, by, some, significant, but, isolated, episodes, in, the, 1970s, a, great, satanism, scare, exploded, in, the, 1980s, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, was, subsequently, exported, towards, england, australia, and, other, countries, it, was, unprecedented, in, history, it, surpassed, even, the, results, of, taxil, s, propaganda, and, has, been, compared, with, the, most, virulent, periods, of, witch, hunting, the, scare, started, in, 1980, and, declined, slowly, between, 1990, and, 1994, when, official, british, and, american, reports, denied, the, real, existence, of, ritual, satanic, crimes, particularly, outside, the, u, s, and, u, k, however, its, consequences, are, still, felt, today, sociologist, of, religion, massimo, introvigne, 2016, one, of, the, primary, sources, for, the, scare, was, michelle, remembers, a, 1980, book, by, the, canadian, psychiatrist, lawrence, pazder, in, which, he, detailed, what, he, claimed, were, the, repressed, memories, of, his, patient, and, wife, michelle, smith, smith, had, claimed, that, as, a, child, she, had, been, abused, by, her, family, in, satanic, rituals, in, which, babies, were, sacrificed, and, satan, himself, appeared, in, 1983, allegations, were, made, that, the, mcmartin, family, owners, of, a, preschool, in, california, were, guilty, of, sexually, abusing, the, children, in, their, care, during, satanic, rituals, the, allegations, resulted, in, a, lengthy, and, expensive, trial, in, which, all, of, the, accused, would, eventually, be, cleared, the, publicity, generated, by, the, case, resulted, in, similar, allegations, being, made, in, various, other, parts, of, the, united, states, a, key, claim, by, the, anti, satanists, of, the, satanic, scare, was, that, any, child, s, claim, about, satanic, ritual, abuse, must, be, true, because, children, do, not, lie, although, some, involved, in, the, anti, satanism, movement, were, from, jewish, and, secular, backgrounds, a, central, part, was, played, by, fundamentalist, and, evangelical, christians, in, particular, pentecostalist, christians, with, christian, groups, holding, conferences, and, producing, books, and, videotapes, to, promote, belief, in, the, conspiracy, various, figures, in, law, enforcement, also, came, to, be, promoters, of, the, conspiracy, theory, with, such, cult, cops, holding, various, conferences, to, promote, it, the, scare, was, later, imported, to, the, united, kingdom, through, visiting, evangelicals, and, became, popular, among, some, of, the, country, s, social, workers, resulting, in, a, range, of, accusations, and, trials, across, britain, in, the, late, 1980s, the, satanic, scare, had, lost, its, impetus, following, increasing, skepticism, about, such, allegations, and, a, number, of, those, who, had, been, convicted, of, perpetrating, satanic, ritual, abuse, saw, their, convictions, overturned, in, 1990, an, agent, of, the, u, s, federal, bureau, of, investigation, ken, lanning, revealed, that, he, had, investigated, 300, allegations, of, satanic, ritual, abuse, and, found, no, evidence, for, satanism, or, ritualistic, activity, in, any, of, them, in, the, uk, the, department, of, health, commissioned, the, anthropologist, jean, la, fontaine, to, examine, the, allegations, of, sra, she, noted, that, while, approximately, half, did, reveal, evidence, of, genuine, sexual, abuse, of, children, none, revealed, any, evidence, that, satanist, groups, had, been, involved, or, that, any, murders, had, taken, place, she, noted, three, examples, in, which, lone, individuals, engaged, in, child, molestation, had, created, a, ritual, performance, to, facilitate, their, sexual, acts, with, the, intent, of, frightening, their, victims, and, justifying, their, actions, but, that, none, of, these, child, molesters, were, involved, in, wider, satanist, groups, by, 1994, the, satanic, ritual, abuse, hysteria, had, died, down, in, the, us, and, uk, and, by, the, 21st, century, hysteria, about, satanism, has, waned, in, most, western, countries, although, allegations, of, satanic, ritual, abuse, continued, to, surface, in, parts, of, continental, europe, and, latin, america, in, the, united, states, sra, ideas, persisted, among, much, of, the, public, even, as, law, enforcement, had, grown, tired, of, false, leads, a, 1994, survey, for, the, women, s, magazine, redbook, reported, in, 1994, another, satanic, conspiracy, theory, arose, in, the, united, states, by, 2017, with, unsubstantiated, allegations, of, organized, devil, worshippers, in, prominent, positions, committing, sexual, abuse, murder, and, cannibalism, the, source, of, such, claims, began, within, a, far, right, political, movement, made, by, an, anonymous, individual, or, individuals, known, as, q, which, were, relayed, and, developed, by, online, communities, and, influencers, the, central, qanon, claim, purports, that, a, global, child, sex, trafficking, ring, made, up, of, democratic, politicians, hollywood, actors, high, ranking, government, officials, business, tycoons, and, medical, experts, were, kidnapping, sexually, abusing, and, eating, children, but, that, then, president, donald, trump, would, round, up, the, cabal, and, bring, them, to, justice, in, a, climactic, event, known, to, supporters, as, the, storm, with, the, lack, of, any, evidence, of, child, abuse, or, harm, and, failure, of, the, prophesized, storm, to, appear, before, the, inauguration, of, a, new, president, the, conspiracy, has, waned, but, not, entirely, disappeared, from, the, late, 1600s, through, to, the, 1800s, the, character, of, satan, was, increasingly, rendered, unimportant, in, western, philosophy, and, ignored, in, christian, theology, while, in, folklore, he, came, to, be, seen, as, a, foolish, rather, than, a, menacing, figure, the, development, of, new, values, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, particular, those, of, reason, and, individualism, contributed, to, a, shift, in, many, europeans, concept, of, satan, in, this, context, a, number, of, individuals, took, satan, out, of, the, traditional, christian, narrative, and, reread, and, reinterpreted, him, in, light, of, their, own, time, and, their, own, interests, in, turn, generating, new, and, different, portraits, of, satan, the, shifting, concept, of, satan, owes, many, of, its, origins, to, john, milton, s, epic, poem, paradise, lost, 1667, in, which, satan, features, as, the, protagonist, milton, was, a, puritan, and, had, never, intended, for, his, depiction, of, satan, to, be, a, sympathetic, one, however, in, portraying, satan, as, a, victim, of, his, own, pride, who, rebelled, against, the, judeo, christian, god, milton, humanized, him, and, also, allowed, him, to, be, interpreted, as, a, rebel, against, tyranny, in, this, vein, the, nineteenth, century, saw, the, emergence, of, what, has, been, termed, literary, satanism, or, romantic, satanism, where, in, poetry, plays, and, novels, god, is, portrayed, not, as, benevolent, but, using, his, omnipotent, power, for, tyranny, whereas, in, christian, doctrine, satan, was, an, enemy, of, not, only, god, but, humanity, in, the, romantic, portrayal, he, was, a, brave, noble, rebel, against, tyranny, a, friend, to, other, victims, of, the, all, powerful, bully, i, e, humans, these, writers, saw, satan, as, a, metaphor, to, criticize, the, power, of, churches, and, state, and, to, champion, the, values, of, reason, and, liberty, this, was, how, milton, s, satan, was, understood, by, john, dryden, and, later, readers, like, the, publisher, joseph, johnson, and, the, anarchist, philosopher, william, godwin, who, reflected, it, in, his, 1793, book, enquiry, concerning, political, justice, paradise, lost, gained, a, wide, readership, in, the, eighteenth, century, both, in, britain, and, in, continental, europe, where, it, had, been, translated, into, french, by, voltaire, milton, thus, became, a, central, character, in, rewriting, satanism, and, would, be, viewed, by, many, later, religious, satanists, as, a, de, facto, satanist, according, to, ruben, van, luijk, this, cannot, be, seen, as, a, coherent, movement, with, a, single, voice, but, rather, as, a, post, factum, identified, group, of, sometimes, widely, divergent, authors, among, whom, a, similar, theme, is, found, for, the, literary, satanists, satan, was, depicted, as, a, benevolent, and, sometimes, heroic, figure, with, these, more, sympathetic, portrayals, proliferating, in, the, art, and, poetry, of, many, romanticist, and, decadent, figures, for, these, individuals, satanism, was, not, a, religious, belief, or, ritual, activity, but, rather, a, strategic, use, of, a, symbol, and, a, character, as, part, of, artistic, and, political, expression, among, the, romanticist, poets, to, adopt, this, concept, of, satan, was, the, english, poet, percy, bysshe, shelley, who, had, been, influenced, by, milton, in, his, poem, laon, and, cythna, shelley, praised, the, serpent, a, reference, to, satan, as, a, force, for, good, in, the, universe, another, was, shelley, s, fellow, british, poet, lord, byron, who, included, satanic, themes, in, his, 1821, play, cain, which, was, a, dramatization, of, the, biblical, story, of, cain, and, abel, these, more, positive, portrayals, also, developed, in, france, one, example, was, the, 1823, work, eloa, by, alfred, de, vigny, satan, was, also, adopted, by, the, french, poet, victor, hugo, who, made, the, character, s, fall, from, heaven, a, central, aspect, of, his, la, fin, de, satan, in, which, he, outlined, his, own, cosmogony, although, the, likes, of, shelley, and, byron, promoted, a, positive, image, of, satan, in, their, work, there, is, no, evidence, that, any, of, them, performed, religious, rites, to, venerate, him, and, thus, they, cannot, be, considered, to, be, religious, satanists, radical, left, wing, political, ideas, had, been, spread, by, the, american, revolution, of, 1775, 83, and, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, 99, the, figure, of, satan, who, was, seen, as, having, rebelled, against, the, tyranny, imposed, by, jehovah, was, appealing, to, many, of, the, radical, leftists, of, the, period, for, them, satan, was, a, symbol, for, the, struggle, against, tyranny, injustice, and, oppression, a, mythical, figure, of, rebellion, for, an, age, of, revolutions, a, larger, than, life, individual, for, an, age, of, individualism, a, free, thinker, in, an, age, struggling, for, free, thought, the, french, anarchist, pierre, joseph, proudhon, who, was, a, staunch, critic, of, christianity, embraced, satan, as, a, symbol, of, liberty, in, several, of, his, writings, another, prominent, 19th, century, anarchist, the, russian, mikhail, bakunin, similarly, described, the, figure, of, satan, as, the, eternal, rebel, the, first, freethinker, and, the, emancipator, of, worlds, in, his, book, god, and, the, state, these, ideas, likely, inspired, the, american, feminist, activist, moses, harman, to, name, his, anarchist, periodical, lucifer, the, lightbearer, the, idea, of, this, leftist, satan, declined, during, the, twentieth, century, although, it, was, used, on, occasion, by, authorities, within, the, soviet, union, who, portrayed, satan, as, a, symbol, of, freedom, and, equality, in, seventeenth, century, sweden, a, number, of, highway, robbers, and, other, outlaws, living, in, the, forests, informed, judges, that, they, venerated, satan, because, he, provided, more, practical, assistance, than, jehovah, practices, now, regarded, as, folkloric, satanism, the, figure, of, lucifer, was, taken, up, by, the, french, ceremonial, magician, liphas, l, vi, 1810, 1875, who, shocked, convention, by, turning, the, traditional, figure, of, evil, into, a, brave, rebel, against, tyranny, l, vi, has, been, described, as, a, romantic, satanist, a, romantic, literary, movement, that, formed, no, organizations, and, did, not, worship, satan, but, did, make, a, crucial, break, away, from, the, traditional, christian, figure, of, the, lord, of, darkness, doomed, to, failure, and, punishment, for, his, wickedness, they, reimagined, satan, as, an, enemy, of, god, the, powerful, but, not, of, the, weak, and, mortal, human, race, in, other, words, a, figure, humans, could, sympathize, with, as, l, vi, moved, toward, political, conservatism, in, later, life, he, retained, the, use, of, the, term, but, instead, applied, it, to, what, he, believed, was, a, morally, neutral, facet, of, the, absolute, l, vi, was, not, the, only, occultist, who, used, the, term, lucifer, without, adopting, the, term, satan, in, a, similar, way, the, early, theosophical, society, believed, that, lucifer, was, a, force, that, aided, humanity, s, awakening, to, its, own, spiritual, nature, the, society, began, publishing, the, journal, lucifer, in, 1887, the, first, person, to, promote, an, explicitly, satanic, philosophy, was, the, polish, writer, stanis, aw, przybyszewski, 1868, 1927, a, decadent, bohemian, who, based, his, ideology, on, social, darwinism, of, the, 1890s, publishing, the, synagogue, of, satan, in, 1897, danish, occultist, carl, william, hansen, 1872, 1936, who, used, the, pen, name, ben, kadosh, listed, luciferian, as, his, religious, affiliation, in, answer, to, the, danish, national, census, his, wife, and, children, were, listed, as, lutheran, making, him, among, the, earliest, self, declared, satanists, hansen, sought, to, spread, a, cult, of, satan, lucifer, and, was, involved, in, a, variety, of, esoteric, groups, including, martinism, freemasonry, and, ordo, templi, orientis, drawing, on, their, ideas, to, establish, his, own, philosophy, he, provided, a, luciferian, interpretation, of, freemasonry, in, a, 1906, pamphlet, though, his, work, had, little, influence, outside, of, denmark, throughout, his, life, british, occultist, aleister, crowley, 1875, 1947, was, widely, described, as, a, satanist, usually, by, detractors, crowley, did, not, consider, himself, a, satanist, nor, did, he, worship, satan, as, he, did, not, accept, the, christian, world, view, in, which, satan, was, believed, to, exist, he, nevertheless, used, imagery, considered, satanic, for, instance, describing, himself, as, the, beast, 666, and, referring, to, the, whore, of, babylon, in, his, work, sending, antichristmas, cards, to, his, friends, later, in, life, crowley, in, many, ways, embodies, the, pre, satanist, esoteric, discourse, on, satan, and, satanism, through, his, lifestyle, and, his, philosophy, with, his, image, and, thought, becoming, an, important, influence, on, the, later, development, of, religious, satanism, both, crowley, and, lavey,

1932, she, promoted, a, theology, centered, on, what, she, called, the, third, term, of, the, trinity, consisting, of, father, son, and, sex, the, last, of, which, she, deemed, to, be, most, important, her, early, disciples, who, underwent, what, she, called, satanic, initiations, included, models, and, art, students, recruited, from, bohemian, circles, the, golden, arrow, disbanded,

to, merit, that, description, and, been, called, instead, a, milieu, dyrendal, lewis, and, petersen, united, by, family, resemblance, and, the, fact, that, most, of, them, were, self, religions, some, of, the, resemblances, in, this, satanic, milieu, are, a, minority, of, satanists, have, some, kind, of, association, with, the, political, far, right, dyrendal, lewis, and, petersen, argue, that, the, groups, within, the, satanic, milieu, can, be, divided, into, three, groups, reactive, satanists, rationalist, satanists, and, esoteric, satanists, diane, e, taub, and, lawrence, d, nelson,

spread, elsewhere, via, globalization, and, the, internet, allowing, for, intra, group, communication, and, creation, of, a, forum, for, satanist, disputes, satanism, started, to, reach, central, and, eastern, europe, in, the, 1990s, in, time, with, the, fall, of, the, communist, bloc, and, most, noticeably, in, poland, and, lithuania, predominantly, roman, catholic, countries, satanism, as, a, self, declared, religion, is, said, by, most, scholars, of, satanism, to, have, truly, begun, in, 1966, with, the, founding, of, the, church, of, satan, cos, by, anton, szandor, lavey, religious, scholars, have, called, the, church, not, only, the, oldest, continuous, satanic, organization, joseph, laycock, james, r, lewis, asprem, granholm, faxneld, and, petersen, but, the, most, influential, with, numerous, imitator, and, breakaway, groups, laycock, r, van, luijk, founded, in, san, francisco, california, in, an, era, when, there, was, much, public, interest, in, the, occult, witchcraft, and, satanism, the, church, enjoyed, a, heyday, for, several, years, after, its, founding, when, a, gigantic, media, circus, developed, around, the, father, of, satanism, and, his, satanic, aesthetics, lavey, shaved, his, head, and, wore, a, goatee, performing, black, masses, with, nude, women, serving, as, altars, was, invited, on, national, talk, shows, and, mingled, with, celebrities, attending, his, satanic, parties, as, an, entrepreneur, he, saw, an, opening, for, a, new, religion, in, the, spiritual, void, of, a, secularizing, post, christian, west, but, lavey, also, promoted, his, ideas, and, his, 1969, satanic, bible, the, best, known, and, most, influential, statement, of, satanic, theology, sold, nearly, a, million, copies, these, had, very, little, connection, with, either, satan, or, the, worship, of, satan, but, were, based, on, the, romantic, literary, concept, of, satan, not, as, a, symbol, of, evil, but, as, a, rebel, anti, hero, defying, god, s, tyranny, with, charisma, and, bravery, together, with, the, romanticism, humanism, hedonism, aspects, of, pop, psychology, and, the, human, potential, movement, were, woven, together, by, lavey, and, publicized, with, a, lot, of, showmanship, philosopher, ayn, rand, who, argued, that, selfishness, is, a, virtue, unfettered, self, interest, is, good, and, altruism, is, destructive, was, a, major, influence, according, to, both, lavey, and, sociologist, of, religion, james, r, lewis, ayn, rand, s, thought, was, a, cornerstone, of, his, philosophy, along, with, ceremony, and, ritual, or, ritual, magic, other, influences, were, friedrich, nietzsche, who, celebrated, the, ubermensch, proclaimed, god, is, dead, and, preached, against, the, slave, s, morality, of, mercy, charity, and, helping, the, weak, english, occultist, aleister, crowley, famous, for, the, axiom, do, what, thou, wilt, shall, be, the, whole, of, the, law, and, arthur, desmond, strongly, associated, with, social, darwinism, and, the, expression, the, survival, of, the, fittest, lavey, used, christianity, as, a, negative, mirror, for, his, new, faith, rejecting, the, basic, principles, theology, and, values, of, christian, belief, along, with, other, major, religions, and, philosophies, such, as, humanitarianism, and, liberal, democracy, which, he, saw, as, negative, forces, instead, of, idealism, humility, abstinence, self, denigration, obedience, herd, behavior, spirituality, and, irrationality, he, praised, the, seven, deadly, sins, pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and, sloth, as, virtues, not, vices, lavey, went, beyond, discouraging, sexual, inhibitions, and, feelings, of, guilt, and, shame, over, fetishes, calling, for, a, celebration, of, and, indulgence, in, humanity, s, animal, nature, and, its, desires, which, christianity, sought, to, suppress, human, beings, should, seek, out, the, carnal, rather, than, the, spiritual, satisfying, the, ego, s, desires, enhanced, an, individual, s, pride, self, respect, and, self, realization, hate, and, aggression, were, necessary, and, advantageous, for, survival, victims, should, not, turn, the, other, cheek, but, take, an, eye, for, an, eye, satanists, should, be, individualistic, non, conformist, contemptuous, of, colorless, mainstream, society, lavey, saw, satanism, as, something, like, a, personality, type, as, much, as, a, belief, since, satanists, are, outsiders, by, their, nature, and, born, not, made, since, gods, are, actually, a, creation, of, man, and, not, the, other, way, around, lavey, asked, why, not, really, be, honest, and, if, you, are, going, to, create, a, god, in, your, image, why, not, create, that, god, as, yourself, every, man, is, a, god, if, he, chooses, to, recognize, himself, as, one, not, everyone, would, measure, up, to, being, a, god, however, human, social, equality, was, a, myth, leading, to, mediocrity, and, support, of, the, weak, at, the, expense, of, the, strong, social, stratification, was, part, of, lavey, and, the, church, s, five, point, program, a, true, satanic, society, was, described, in, lavey, s, church, s, periodical, the, black, flame, and, highlighted, by, anthropologist, jean, la, fontaine, it, would, be, one, in, which, the, population, consists, of, free, spirited, well, armed, fully, conscious, self, disciplined, individuals, who, will, neither, need, nor, tolerate, any, external, entity, protecting, them, or, telling, them, what, they, can, and, cannot, do, another, version, of, the, satanic, society, envisioned, by, lavey, was, the, breeding, of, an, elite, people, superior, in, their, creativity, and, nonconformity, these, would, live, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, human, herd, who, would, be, relegated, into, ghettoes, ideally, space, ghettoes, located, on, other, planets, lavey, s, ideas, were, also, said, to, seem, contradictory, according, to, joseph, laycock, according, to, one, cos, priest, gavin, baddeley, lavey, s, church, combined, a, love, of, life, garbed, in, the, symbols, of, death, and, fear, and, while, lavey, himself, pontificated, on, personal, freedom, he, micromanaged, the, lives, of, his, followers, some, lucien, greaves, doubted, his, atheist, naturalism, lavey, insisted, the, church, scoffed, at, the, supernatural, but, also, told, a, interviewer, he, considered, curses, and, hexes, against, enemies, a, form, of, human, sacrifice, by, proxy, contradictions, in, his, thought, have, been, explained, by, his, wanting, it, to, have, as, wide, appeal, as, possible, balancing, in, his, words, nine, parts, of, respectability, to, one, part, of, outrageousness, if, satanism, was, to, be, satanic, it, required, some, outrageous, anti, social, elements, but, if, it, was, going, to, be, a, viable, organization, these, could, not, be, allowed, to, frighten, off, potential, congregants, and, attract, unwanted, attention, one, outrageous, issue, that, lavey, was, criticized, for, was, his, ambivalent, relationship, with, far, right, groups, united, klans, of, america, national, renaissance, party, and, the, american, nazi, party, that, he, neither, endorsed, nor, rejected, lavey, died, in, 1997, but, the, church, maintains, a, purist, approach, to, his, thought, insisting, he, and, the, church, have, codified, satanism, as, a, religion, and, philosophy, and, dismisses, other, satanist, groups, atheistic, or, otherwise, as, reverse, christians, pseudo, satanists, or, devil, worshipers, the, satanic, temple, tst, has, been, called, the, most, prominent, satanic, organization, in, terms, of, both, size, and, public, activity, as, of, late, 2023, based, in, salem, massachusetts, and, active, since, 2012, it, claims, 700, 000, members, worldwide, like, the, older, church, of, satan, its, congregants, do, not, believe, in, a, supernatural, satan, but, if, the, cos, saw, satanism, as, a, negative, mirror, of, christianity, reversing, christian, principles, of, altruism, helping, the, downtrodden, and, community, mindedness, the, christian, principles, tst, wants, to, reverse, are, politically, conservative, activist, ones, the, elimination, of, the, right, to, abortion, the, teaching, of, evolution, the, separation, of, church, and, state, etc, this, left, wing, socially, engaged, satanism, involves, activism, rather, than, the, individualism, and, right, wing, oriented, getting, what, you, want, for, yourself, of, the, cos, they, have, been, called, rationalist, political, pranksters, by, dyrendal, lewis, and, petersen, with, pranks, designed, to, highlight, religious, hypocrisy, and, advance, the, cause, of, secularism, one, such, prank, was, performing, a, pink, mass, over, the, grave, of, the, mother, of, the, evangelical,

religious, organization, it, was, founded, in, 1975, when, michael, aquino, the, founder, of, a, church, of, satan, grotto, in, louisville, kentucky, and, editor, of, the, church, s, newsletter, the, cloven, hoof, left, the, church, taking, 28, members, with, him, aquino, s, anger, that, lavey, had, devalued, his, high, level, grade, of, magister, in, the, church, may, have, initiated, his, break, but, aquino, also, disagreed, with, lavey, s, materialist, philosophy, arguing, that, while, the, church, might, publicly, be, materialist, satan, as, symbol, was, only, part, of, the, truth, aquino, held, a, ritual, to, ask, satan, where, to, lead, his, cos, defectors, and, on, the, night, of, june, 21, 22, 1975, satan, allegedly, told, him, to, reconsecrate, my, temple, and, my, order, in, the, true, name, of, set, no, longer, will, i, accept, the, bastard, title, of, a, hebrew, fiend, thus, aquino, came, to, believe, that, the, name, satan, was, a, corruption, of, the, name, set, the, egyptian, god, of, darkness, the, philosophy, of, the, temple, of, set, may, be, summed, up, as, enlightened, individualism, enhancement, and, improvement, of, oneself, by, personal, education,

law, abiding, to, be, true, satanists, grew, particularly, among, musicians, and, fans, in, extreme, heavy, metal, music, where, being, more, extreme, meant, being, more, authentic, these, antinomian, and, amoral, satanic, or, post, satanic, groups, are, sometimes, called, the, sinister, tradition, of, satanism, the, order, of, nine, angles, has, been, called, the, ur, type, that, defines, the,

satanist, better, than, other, groups, by, embracing, deeply, shocking, and, illegal, acts, several, british, politicians, including, the, labour, party, s, yvette, cooper, chair, of, the, home,

occult, organization, that, combines, satanism, the, ancient, alien, astronaut, hypothesis, and, antisemitism, it, was, founded, in, the, early, 2000s, by, maxine, dietrich, pseudonym, of, andrea, maxine, dietrich, wife, of, the, american, national, socialist, movement, s, co, founder, and, former, leader, clifford, herrington, with, its, inception, spiritual, satanism, was, born, a, current, that, until, recently, was, regarded, only, as, theist, but, then, defined, into, spiritual, satanism, by, theistic, satanists, who, concluded, that, the, term, spiritual, in, satanism, represented, the, best, answer, to, the, world, considering, it, a, moral, slap, toward, the, earlier, carnal, and, materialistic, laveyan, satanism, and, instead, focusing, its, attention, upon, spiritual, evolution, joy, of, satan, presents, a, unique, synthesis, of, theistic, satanism, nazism, gnosticism, paganism, western, esotericism, ufo, conspiracy, theories, and, extraterrestrial, hypotheses, similar, to, those, popularized, by, zecharia, sitchin, and, david, icke, members, of, joy, of, satan, are, generally, polytheists, believing, that, satan, is, one, of, many, deities, while, satan, and, demons, are, considered, deities, within, jos, the, deities, themselves, are, understood, to, be, highly, evolved, un, aging, sentient, and, powerful, humanoid, extraterrestrial, beings, satan, and, many, demons, are, equated, with, gods, from, ancient, cultures, some, of, which, include, the, sumerian, god, enki, and, the, yazidi, angel, melek, taus, being, seen, as, satan, borrowing, their, theistic, satanist, interpretations, of, enki, from, the, writings, of, zecharia, sitchin, and, melek, taus, partially, deriving, from, the, writings, of, anton, lavey, satan, is, seen, not, only, as, an, important, deity, but, a, powerful, and, sentient, being, responsible, for, the, creation, of, humanity, satan, is, also, revered, by, jos, as, the, true, father, and, creator, god, of, humanity, the, bringer, of, knowledge, and, whose, desire, is, for, his, creations, humans, to, elevate, themselves, through, knowledge, and, understanding, in, their, beliefs, yazidism, a, pre,

functions, as, the, ruler, of, the, world, but, who, muslims, believe, is, a, fallen, angel, is, in, juxtaposition, with, satanism, as, they, consider, the, two, share, similar, elements, such, as, yazidi, devotees, being, defined, by, muslims, as, devotees, to, shaytan, and, regarded, as, satanists, it, is, also, believed, that, the, figure, of, melek, taus, the, peacock, angel, may, derive, from, much, older, pagan, deities, such, as, saraswati, the, hindu, goddess, of, wisdom, who, rides, a, peacock, or, even, the, god, indra, who, transforms, into, a, peacock, the, story, of, melek, taus, itself, is, also, considered, by, jos, to, have, many, satanic, elements, such, as, being, described, as, the, angel, who, rebelled, against, the, abrahamic, god, the, sacred, text, of, the, yazidis, the, al, jilwah, is, claimed, by, the, jos, as, the, word, of, satan, while, maintaining, some, popularity, as, a, theistic, satanist, sect, the, group, has, been, widely, criticized, for, its, association, with, the, national, socialist, movement, and, its, racial, anti, jewish, anti, judaic, and, anti, christian, sentiment, as, well, as, its, anti, semitic, conspiracy, theories, much, of, their, beliefs, on, aliens, meditation, and, telepathic, contacts, with, demons, have, become, popular, in, a, larger, milieu, within, the, currents, of, recent, non, laveyan, theistic, satanism, according, to, petersen, s, survey, 2014, joy, of, satan, s, angelfire, network, has, a, surprising, prominence, among, theistic, satanist, websites, on, the, internet, in, addition, james, r, lewis,

lewis, and, petersen, used, the, term, reactive, satanism, to, describe, one, form, of, modern, satanism, they, described, this, as, an, adolescent, and, anti, social, means, of, rebelling, in, a, christian, society, by, which, an, individual, transgresses, cultural, boundaries, which, tends, to, fall, into, two, tendencies, the, researcher, gareth, medway, noted, that, in, 1995, he, encountered, a, british, woman, who, stated, that, she, had, been, a, practicing, satanist, during, her, teenage, years, she, had, grown, up, in, a, small, mining, village, and, had, come, to, believe, that, she, had, psychic, powers, after, hearing, about, satanism, in, some, library, books, she, declared, herself, a, satanist, and, formulated, a, belief, that, satan, was, the, true, god, after, her, teenage, years, she, abandoned, satanism, and, became, a, chaos, magickian, some, personal, satanists, are, teenagers, or, mentally, disturbed, individuals, who, have, engaged, in,

imagery, introvigne, stated, that, these, incidents, were, more, a, product, of, juvenile, deviance, and, marginalization, than, satanism, in, a, few, cases, the, crimes, of, these, personal, satanists, have, included, murder, a, survey, in, the, encyclopedia, of, satanism, found, that, people, became, involved, with, satanism, in, many, diverse, ways, and, were, found, in, many, countries, the, survey, found, that, more, satanists, were, raised, as, protestant, christians, than, catholic, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, organized, satanism, emerged, out, of, the, occult, subculture, with, the, formation, of, the, church, of, satan, it, was, not, long, however, before, satanism, had, expanded, well, beyond, the, church, of, satan, the, decentralization, of, the, satanist, movement, was, considerably, accelerated, when, anton, lavey, disbanded, the, grotto, system, in, the, mid, 1970s, at, present, religious, satanism, exists, primarily, as, a, decentralized, subculture, unlike, traditional, religions, and, even, unlike, the, early, satanist, bodies, such, as, the, church, of, satan, and, the, temple, of, set, contemporary, satanism, is, for, the, most, part, a, decentralized, movement, in, the, past, this, movement, has, been, propagated, through, the, medium, of, certain, popular, books, especially, lavey, s, satanic, bible, in, more, recent, years, the, internet, has, come, to, play, a, significant, role, in, reaching, potential, converts, particularly, among, disaffected, young, people, religion, scholar, and, researcher, of, new, religious, movements, james, r, lewis, dyrendal, lewis, and, petersen, observed, that, from, surveys, of, satanists, conducted, in, the, early, 21st, century, it, was, clear, that, the, satanic, milieu, was, heavily, dominated, by, young, males, they, nevertheless, noted, that, census, data, from, new, zealand, suggested, that, there, may, be, a, growing, proportion, of, women, becoming, satanists, in, comprising, more, men, than, women, satanism, differs, from, most, other, religious, communities, including, most, new, religious, communities, most, satanists, came, to, their, religion, through, reading, either, online, or, books, rather, than, through, being, introduced, to, it, through, personal, contacts, many, practitioners, do, not, claim, that, they, converted, to, satanism, but, rather, state, that, they, were, born, that, way, and, only, later, in, life, confirmed, that, satanism, served, as, an, appropriate, label, for, their, pre, existing, worldviews, others, have, stated, that, they, had, experiences, with, supernatural, phenomena, that, led, them, to, embracing, satanism, a, number, of, satanists, reported, anger, toward, some, practicing, christians, and, said, that, the, monotheistic, gods, of, christianity, and, other, religions, are, unethical, citing, issues, such, as, the, problem, of, evil, for, some, practitioners, satanism,

numbers, of, theistic, satanists, appeared, to, grow, over, time, beliefs, in, the, afterlife, varied, although, the, most, common, beliefs, about, the, afterlife, were, reincarnation, and, the, idea, that, consciousness, survives, bodily, death, the, surveys, also, demonstrated, that, most, recorded, satanists, practiced, magic, although, there, were, differing, opinions, as, to, whether, magical, acts, operated, according, to, etheric, laws, or, whether, the, effect, of, magic, was, purely, psychological, a, number, of, satanists, described, performing, cursing, in, most, cases, as, a, form, of, vigilante, justice, most, practitioners, conduct, their, religious, observances, in, a, solitary, manner, and, never, or, rarely, meet, fellow, satanists, for, rituals, rather, the, primary, interaction, that, takes, place, between, satanists, is, online, on, websites, or, via, email, from, their, survey, data, dyrendal, lewis, and, petersen, noted, that, the, average, length, of, involvement, in, the, satanic, milieu, was, seven, years, a, satanist, s, involvement, in, the, movement, tends, to, peak, in, their, early, twenties, and, drops, off, sharply, in, their, thirties, a, small, proportion, retain, their, allegiance, to, the, religion, into, their, elder, years, when, asked, about, their, ideology, the, largest, proportion, of, satanists, identified, as, apolitical, or, non, aligned, while, only, a, small, percentage, identified, as, conservative, a, small, minority, of, satanists, expressed, support, for, nazism, conversely, over, two, thirds, expressed, opposition, or, strong, opposition, to, it, the, 2021, canadian, census, states, that, 5, 890, canadians, identify, as, satanist, representing, 0, 02, of, the, population, compared, to, the, general, population, satanists, are, more, likely, to, be, male, aged, in, their, 20s, or, 30s, and, not, a, member, of, any, recognized, minority, group, although, the, japanese, are, an, exception, with,

1970s, for, example, the, band, black, sabbath, made, mention, of, satan, in, their, lyrics, although, some, of, the, band, s, members, were, practicing, christians, and, other, lyrics, affirmed, the, power, of, the, christian, god, over, satan, in, the, 1980s, greater, use, of, satanic, imagery, was, made, by, heavy, metal, bands, like, slayer, kreator, sodom, and, destruction, bands, active, in, the, subgenre, of, death, metal, among, them, deicide, morbid, angel, and, entombed, also, adopted, satanic, imagery, combining, it, with, other, morbid, and, dark, imagery, such, as, that, of, zombies, and, serial, killers, satanism, would, come, to, be, more, closely, associated, with, the, subgenre, of, black, metal, in, which, it, was, foregrounded, over, the, other, themes, that, had, been, used, in, death, metal, a, number, of, black, metal, performers, incorporated, self, injury, into, their, act, framing, this, as, a, manifestation, of, satanic, devotion, the, first, black, metal, band, venom, proclaimed, themselves, to, be, satanists, although, this, was, more, an, act, of, provocation, than, an, expression, of, genuine, devotion, to, the, devil, satanic, themes, were, also, used, by, the, black, metal, bands, bathory, and, hellhammer, however, the, first, black, metal, act, to, more, seriously, adopt, satanism, was, mercyful, fate, whose, vocalist, king, diamond,

referring, to, their, beliefs, as, devil, worship, these, individuals, regarded, satan, as, a, literal, entity, and, in, contrast, to, anton, lavey, they, associated, satanism, with, criminality,
