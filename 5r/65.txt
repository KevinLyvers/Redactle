https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)
in, philosophy, naturalism, is, the, idea, that, only, natural, laws, and, forces, as, opposed, to, supernatural, ones, operate, in, the, universe, in, its, primary, sense, it, is, also, known, as, ontological, naturalism, metaphysical, naturalism, pure, naturalism, philosophical, naturalism, and, antisupernaturalism, ontological, refers, to, ontology, the, philosophical, study, of, what, exists, philosophers, often, treat, naturalism, as, equivalent, to, materialism, but, there, are, important, distinctions, between, the, philosophies, for, example, philosopher, paul, kurtz, argues, that, nature, is, best, accounted, for, by, reference, to, material, principles, these, principles, include, mass, energy, and, other, physical, and, chemical, properties, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, further, this, sense, of, naturalism, holds, that, spirits, deities, and, ghosts, are, not, real, and, that, there, is, no, purpose, in, nature, this, stronger, formulation, of, naturalism, is, commonly, referred, to, as, metaphysical, naturalism, on, the, other, hand, the, more, moderate, view, that, naturalism, should, be, assumed, in, one, s, working, methods, as, the, current, paradigm, without, any, further, consideration, of, whether, naturalism, is, true, in, the, robust, metaphysical, sense, is, called, methodological, naturalism, with, the, exception, of, pantheists, who, believe, that, nature, is, identical, with, divinity, while, not, recognizing, a, distinct, personal, anthropomorphic, god, theists, challenge, the, idea, that, nature, contains, all, of, reality, according, to, some, theists, natural, laws, may, be, viewed, as, secondary, causes, of, god, s, in, the, 20th, century, willard, van, orman, quine, george, santayana, and, other, philosophers, argued, that, the, success, of, naturalism, in, science, meant, that, scientific, methods, should, also, be, used, in, philosophy, according, to, this, view, science, and, philosophy, are, not, always, distinct, from, one, another, but, instead, form, a, continuum, naturalism, is, not, so, much, a, special, system, as, a, point, of, view, or, tendency, common, to, a, number, of, philosophical, and, religious, systems, not, so, much, a, well, defined, set, of, positive, and, negative, doctrines, as, an, attitude, or, spirit, pervading, and, influencing, many, doctrines, as, the, name, implies, this, tendency, consists, essentially, in, looking, upon, nature, as, the, one, original, and, fundamental, source, of, all, that, exists, and, in, attempting, to, explain, everything, in, terms, of, nature, either, the, limits, of, nature, are, also, the, limits, of, existing, reality, or, at, least, the, first, cause, if, its, existence, is, found, necessary, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, working, of, natural, agencies, all, events, therefore, find, their, adequate, explanation, within, nature, itself, but, as, the, terms, nature, and, natural, are, themselves, used, in, more, than, one, sense, the, term, naturalism, is, also, far, from, having, one, fixed, meaning, naturalism, is, most, notably, a, western, phenomenon, but, an, equivalent, idea, has, long, existed, in, the, east, naturalism, was, the, foundation, of, two, out, of, six, orthodox, schools, and, one, heterodox, school, of, hinduism, samkhya, one, of, the, oldest, schools, of, indian, philosophy, puts, nature, prakriti, as, the, primary, cause, of, the, universe, without, assuming, the, existence, of, a, personal, god, or, ishvara, the, carvaka, nyaya, vaisheshika, schools, originated, in, the, 7th, 6th, and, 2nd, century, bce, respectively, similarly, though, unnamed, and, never, articulated, into, a, coherent, system, one, tradition, within, confucian, philosophy, embraced, a, form, of, naturalism, dating, to, the, wang, chong, in, the, 1st, century, if, not, earlier, but, it, arose, independently, and, had, little, influence, on, the, development, of, modern, naturalist, philosophy, or, on, eastern, or, western, culture, western, metaphysical, naturalism, originated, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, the, earliest, pre, socratic, philosophers, especially, the, milesians, thales, anaximander, and, anaximenes, and, the, atomists, leucippus, and, democritus, were, labeled, by, their, peers, and, successors, the, physikoi, from, the, greek, or, physikos, meaning, natural, philosopher, borrowing, on, the, word, or, physis, meaning, nature, because, they, investigated, natural, causes, often, excluding, any, role, for, gods, in, the, creation, or, operation, of, the, world, this, eventually, led, to, fully, developed, systems, such, as, epicureanism, which, sought, to, explain, everything, that, exists, as, the, product, of, atoms, falling, and, swerving, in, a, void, aristotle, surveyed, the, thought, of, his, predecessors, and, conceived, of, nature, in, a, way, that, charted, a, middle, course, between, their, excesses, plato, s, world, of, eternal, and, unchanging, forms, imperfectly, represented, in, matter, by, a, divine, artisan, contrasts, sharply, with, the, various, mechanistic, weltanschauungen, of, which, atomism, was, by, the, fourth, century, at, least, the, most, prominent, this, debate, was, to, persist, throughout, the, ancient, world, atomistic, mechanism, got, a, shot, in, the, arm, from, epicurus, while, the, stoics, adopted, a, divine, teleology, the, choice, seems, simple, either, show, how, a, structured, regular, world, could, arise, out, of, undirected, processes, or, inject, intelligence, into, the, system, this, was, how, aristotle, when, still, a, young, acolyte, of, plato, saw, matters, cicero, preserves, aristotle, s, own, cave, image, if, troglodytes, were, brought, on, a, sudden, into, the, upper, world, they, would, immediately, suppose, it, to, have, been, intelligently, arranged, but, aristotle, grew, to, abandon, this, view, although, he, believes, in, a, divine, being, the, prime, mover, is, not, the, efficient, cause, of, action, in, the, universe, and, plays, no, part, in, constructing, or, arranging, it, but, although, he, rejects, the, divine, artificer, aristotle, does, not, resort, to, a, pure, mechanism, of, random, forces, instead, he, seeks, to, find, a, middle, way, between, the, two, positions, one, which, relies, heavily, on, the, notion, of, nature, or, phusis, with, the, rise, and, dominance, of, christianity, in, the, west, and, the, later, spread, of, islam, metaphysical, naturalism, was, generally, abandoned, by, intellectuals, thus, there, is, little, evidence, for, it, in, medieval, philosophy, it, was, not, until, the, early, modern, era, of, philosophy, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, that, naturalists, like, benedict, spinoza, who, put, forward, a, theory, of, psychophysical, parallelism, david, hume, and, the, proponents, of, french, materialism, notably, denis, diderot, julien, la, mettrie, and, baron, d, holbach, started, to, emerge, again, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, this, period, some, metaphysical, naturalists, adhered, to, a, distinct, doctrine, materialism, which, became, the, dominant, category, of, metaphysical, naturalism, widely, defended, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, thomas, hobbes, was, a, proponent, of, naturalism, in, ethics, who, acknowledged, normative, truths, and, properties, immanuel, kant, rejected, reductionist, materialist, positions, in, metaphysics, but, he, was, not, hostile, to, naturalism, his, transcendental, philosophy, is, considered, to, be, a, form, of, liberal, naturalism, in, late, modern, philosophy, naturphilosophie, a, form, of, natural, philosophy, was, developed, by, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, von, schelling, and, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, as, an, attempt, to, comprehend, nature, in, its, totality, and, to, outline, its, general, theoretical, structure, a, version, of, naturalism, that, arose, after, hegel, was, ludwig, feuerbach, s, anthropological, materialism, which, influenced, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, s, historical, materialism, engels, s, materialist, dialectic, philosophy, of, nature, dialectics, of, nature, and, their, follower, georgi, plekhanov, s, dialectical, materialism, another, notable, school, of, late, modern, philosophy, advocating, naturalism, was, german, materialism, members, included, ludwig, b, chner, jacob, moleschott, and, carl, vogt, the, current, usage, of, the, term, naturalism, derives, from, debates, in, america, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, self, proclaimed, naturalists, from, that, period, included, john, dewey, ernest, nagel, sidney, hook, and, roy, wood, sellars, a, politicized, version, of, naturalism, that, has, arisen, in, contemporary, philosophy, is, ayn, rand, s, objectivism, objectivism, is, an, expression, of, capitalist, ethical, idealism, within, a, naturalistic, framework, an, example, of, a, more, progressive, naturalistic, philosophy, is, secular, humanism, the, current, usage, of, the, term, naturalism, derives, from, debates, in, america, in, the, first, half, of, the, last, century, currently, metaphysical, naturalism, is, more, widely, embraced, than, in, previous, centuries, especially, but, not, exclusively, in, the, natural, sciences, and, the, anglo, american, analytic, philosophical, communities, while, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, of, the, world, remains, firmly, committed, to, non, naturalistic, worldviews, contemporary, defenders, of, naturalism, and, or, naturalistic, theses, and, doctrines, today, include, kai, nielsen, j, j, c, smart, david, malet, armstrong, david, papineau, paul, kurtz, brian, leiter, daniel, dennett, michael, devitt, fred, dretske, paul, and, patricia, churchland, mario, bunge, jonathan, schaffer, hilary, kornblith, leonard, olson, quentin, smith, paul, draper, and, michael, martin, among, many, other, academic, philosophers, according, to, david, papineau, contemporary, naturalism, is, a, consequence, of, the, build, up, of, scientific, evidence, during, the, twentieth, century, for, the, causal, closure, of, the, physical, the, doctrine, that, all, physical, effects, can, be, accounted, for, by, physical, causes, by, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, the, acceptance, of, the, causal, closure, of, the, physical, realm, led, to, even, stronger, naturalist, views, the, causal, closure, thesis, implies, that, any, mental, and, biological, causes, must, themselves, be, physically, constituted, if, they, are, to, produce, physical, effects, it, thus, gives, rise, to, a, particularly, strong, form, of, ontological, naturalism, namely, the, physicalist, doctrine, that, any, state, that, has, physical, effects, must, itself, be, physical, from, the, 1950s, onwards, philosophers, began, to, formulate, arguments, for, ontological, physicalism, some, of, these, arguments, appealed, explicitly, to, the, causal, closure, of, the, physical, realm, feigl, 1958, oppenheim, and, putnam, 1958, in, other, cases, the, reliance, on, causal, closure, lay, below, the, surface, however, it, is, not, hard, to, see, that, even, in, these, latter, cases, the, causal, closure, thesis, played, a, crucial, role, in, contemporary, continental, philosophy, quentin, meillassoux, proposed, speculative, materialism, a, post, kantian, return, to, david, hume, which, can, strengthen, classical, materialist, ideas, the, term, methodological, naturalism, is, much, more, recent, though, according, to, ronald, numbers, it, was, coined, in, 1983, by, paul, de, vries, a, wheaton, college, philosopher, de, vries, distinguished, between, what, he, called, methodological, naturalism, a, disciplinary, method, that, says, nothing, about, god, s, existence, and, metaphysical, naturalism, which, denies, the, existence, of, a, transcendent, god, the, term, methodological, naturalism, had, been, used, in, 1937, by, edgar, s, brightman, in, an, article, in, the, philosophical, review, as, a, contrast, to, naturalism, in, general, but, there, the, idea, was, not, really, developed, to, its, more, recent, distinctions, according, to, steven, schafersman, naturalism, is, a, philosophy, that, maintains, that, or, as, carl, sagan, succinctly, put, it, the, cosmos, is, all, that, is, or, ever, was, or, ever, will, be, in, addition, arthur, c, danto, states, that, naturalism, in, recent, usage, is, a, species, of, philosophical, monism, according, to, which, whatever, exists, or, happens, is, natural, in, the, sense, of, being, susceptible, to, explanation, through, methods, which, although, paradigmatically, exemplified, in, the, natural, sciences, are, continuous, from, domain, to, domain, of, objects, and, events, hence, naturalism, is, polemically, defined, as, repudiating, the, view, that, there, exists, or, could, exist, any, entities, which, lie, in, principle, beyond, the, scope, of, scientific, explanation, arthur, newell, strahler, states, the, naturalistic, view, is, that, the, particular, universe, we, observe, came, into, existence, and, has, operated, through, all, time, and, in, all, its, parts, without, the, impetus, or, guidance, of, any, supernatural, agency, the, great, majority, of, contemporary, philosophers, urge, that, that, reality, is, exhausted, by, nature, containing, nothing, supernatural, and, that, the, scientific, method, should, be, used, to, investigate, all, areas, of, reality, including, the, human, spirit, philosophers, widely, regard, naturalism, as, a, positive, term, and, few, active, philosophers, nowadays, are, happy, to, announce, themselves, as, non, naturalists, philosophers, concerned, with, religion, tend, to, be, less, enthusiastic, about, naturalism, and, that, despite, an, inevitable, divergence, due, to, its, popularity, if, more, narrowly, construed, to, the, chagrin, of, john, mcdowell, david, chalmers, and, jennifer, hornsby, for, example, those, not, so, disqualified, remain, nonetheless, content, to, set, the, bar, for, naturalism, higher, alvin, plantinga, stated, that, naturalism, is, presumed, to, not, be, a, religion, however, in, one, very, important, respect, it, resembles, religion, by, performing, the, cognitive, function, of, a, religion, there, is, a, set, of, deep, human, questions, to, which, a, religion, typically, provides, an, answer, in, like, manner, naturalism, gives, a, set, of, answers, to, these, questions, according, to, robert, priddy, all, scientific, study, inescapably, builds, on, at, least, some, essential, assumptions, that, cannot, be, tested, by, scientific, processes, that, is, that, scientists, must, start, with, some, assumptions, as, to, the, ultimate, analysis, of, the, facts, with, which, it, deals, these, assumptions, would, then, be, justified, partly, by, their, adherence, to, the, types, of, occurrence, of, which, we, are, directly, conscious, and, partly, by, their, success, in, representing, the, observed, facts, with, a, certain, generality, devoid, of, ad, hoc, suppositions, kuhn, also, claims, that, all, science, is, based, on, assumptions, about, the, character, of, the, universe, rather, than, merely, on, empirical, facts, these, assumptions, a, paradigm, comprise, a, collection, of, beliefs, values, and, techniques, that, are, held, by, a, given, scientific, community, which, legitimize, their, systems, and, set, the, limitations, to, their, investigation, for, naturalists, nature, is, the, only, reality, the, correct, paradigm, and, there, is, no, such, thing, as, supernatural, i, e, anything, above, beyond, or, outside, of, nature, the, scientific, method, is, to, be, used, to, investigate, all, reality, including, the, human, spirit, some, claim, that, naturalism, is, the, implicit, philosophy, of, working, scientists, and, that, the, following, basic, assumptions, are, needed, to, justify, the, scientific, method, methodological, naturalism, the, second, sense, of, the, term, naturalism, see, above, is, the, adoption, or, assumption, of, philosophical, naturalism, with, or, without, fully, accepting, or, believing, it, robert, t, pennock, used, the, term, to, clarify, that, the, scientific, method, confines, itself, to, natural, explanations, without, assuming, the, existence, or, non, existence, of, the, supernatural, we, may, therefore, be, agnostic, about, the, ultimate, truth, of, naturalism, but, nevertheless, adopt, it, and, investigate, nature, as, if, nature, is, all, that, there, is, according, to, ronald, numbers, the, term, methodological, naturalism, was, coined, in, 1983, by, paul, de, vries, a, wheaton, college, philosopher, both, schafersman, and, strahler, assert, that, it, is, illogical, to, try, to, decouple, the, two, senses, of, naturalism, while, science, as, a, process, only, requires, methodological, naturalism, the, practice, or, adoption, of, methodological, naturalism, entails, a, logical, and, moral, belief, in, philosophical, naturalism, so, they, are, not, logically, decoupled, this, naturalistic, view, is, espoused, by, science, as, its, fundamental, assumption, but, eugenie, scott, finds, it, imperative, to, do, so, for, the, expediency, of, deprogramming, the, religious, scientists, can, defuse, some, of, the, opposition, to, evolution, by, first, recognizing, that, the, vast, majority, of, americans, are, believers, and, that, most, americans, want, to, retain, their, faith, scott, apparently, believes, that, individuals, can, retain, religious, beliefs, and, still, accept, evolution, through, methodological, naturalism, scientists, should, therefore, avoid, mentioning, metaphysical, naturalism, and, use, methodological, naturalism, instead, even, someone, who, may, disagree, with, my, logic, often, understands, the, strategic, reasons, for, separating, methodological, from, philosophical, naturalism, if, we, want, more, americans, to, understand, evolution, scott, s, approach, has, found, success, as, illustrated, in, ecklund, s, study, where, some, religious, scientists, reported, that, their, religious, beliefs, affect, the, way, they, think, about, the, implications, often, moral, of, their, work, but, not, the, way, they, practice, science, within, methodological, naturalism, papineau, notes, that, philosophers, concerned, with, religion, tend, to, be, less, enthusiastic, about, metaphysical, naturalism, and, that, those, not, so, disqualified, remain, content, to, set, the, bar, for, naturalism, higher, in, contrast, to, schafersman, strahler, and, scott, robert, t, pennock, an, expert, witness, at, the, kitzmiller, v, dover, area, school, district, trial, and, cited, by, the, judge, in, his, memorandum, opinion, described, methodological, naturalism, stating, that, it, is, not, based, on, dogmatic, metaphysical, naturalism, pennock, further, states, that, as, supernatural, agents, and, powers, are, above, and, beyond, the, natural, world, and, its, agents, and, powers, and, are, not, constrained, by, natural, laws, only, logical, impossibilities, constrain, what, a, supernatural, agent, cannot, do, in, addition, he, says, if, we, could, apply, natural, knowledge, to, understand, supernatural, powers, then, by, definition, they, would, not, be, supernatural, because, the, supernatural, is, necessarily, a, mystery, to, us, it, can, provide, no, grounds, on, which, one, can, judge, scientific, models, experimentation, requires, observation, and, control, of, the, variables, but, by, definition, we, have, no, control, over, supernatural, entities, or, forces, the, position, that, the, study, of, the, function, of, nature, is, also, the, study, of, the, origin, of, nature, is, in, contrast, with, opponents, who, take, the, position, that, functioning, of, the, cosmos, is, unrelated, to, how, it, originated, while, they, are, open, to, supernatural, fiat, in, its, invention, and, coming, into, existence, during, scientific, study, to, explain, the, functioning, of, the, cosmos, they, do, not, appeal, to, the, supernatural, they, agree, that, allowing, science, to, appeal, to, untestable, supernatural, powers, to, explain, how, nature, functions, would, make, the, scientist, s, task, meaningless, undermine, the, discipline, that, allows, science, to, make, progress, and, would, be, as, profoundly, unsatisfying, as, the, ancient, greek, playwright, s, reliance, upon, the, deus, ex, machina, to, extract, his, hero, from, a, difficult, predicament, w, v, o, quine, describes, naturalism, as, the, position, that, there, is, no, higher, tribunal, for, truth, than, natural, science, itself, in, his, view, there, is, no, better, method, than, the, scientific, method, for, judging, the, claims, of, science, and, there, is, neither, any, need, nor, any, place, for, a, first, philosophy, such, as, abstract, metaphysics, or, epistemology, that, could, stand, behind, and, justify, science, or, the, scientific, method, therefore, philosophy, should, feel, free, to, make, use, of, the, findings, of, scientists, in, its, own, pursuit, while, also, feeling, free, to, offer, criticism, when, those, claims, are, ungrounded, confused, or, inconsistent, in, quine, s, view, philosophy, is, continuous, with, science, and, both, are, empirical, naturalism, is, not, a, dogmatic, belief, that, the, modern, view, of, science, is, entirely, correct, instead, it, simply, holds, that, science, is, the, best, way, to, explore, the, processes, of, the, universe, and, that, those, processes, are, what, modern, science, is, striving, to, understand, karl, popper, equated, naturalism, with, inductive, theory, of, science, he, rejected, it, based, on, his, general, critique, of, induction, see, problem, of, induction, yet, acknowledged, its, utility, as, means, for, inventing, conjectures, a, naturalistic, methodology, sometimes, called, an, inductive, theory, of, science, has, its, value, no, doubt, i, reject, the, naturalistic, view, it, is, uncritical, its, upholders, fail, to, notice, that, whenever, they, believe, to, have, discovered, a, fact, they, have, only, proposed, a, convention, hence, the, convention, is, liable, to, turn, into, a, dogma, this, criticism, of, the, naturalistic, view, applies, not, only, to, its, criterion, of, meaning, but, also, to, its, idea, of, science, and, consequently, to, its, idea, of, empirical, method, popper, instead, proposed, that, science, should, adopt, a, methodology, based, on, falsifiability, for, demarcation, because, no, number, of, experiments, can, ever, prove, a, theory, but, a, single, experiment, can, contradict, one, popper, holds, that, scientific, theories, are, characterized, by, falsifiability, alvin, plantinga, professor, emeritus, of, philosophy, at, notre, dame, and, a, christian, has, become, a, well, known, critic, of, naturalism, he, suggests, in, his, evolutionary, argument, against, naturalism, that, the, probability, that, evolution, has, produced, humans, with, reliable, true, beliefs, is, low, or, inscrutable, unless, the, evolution, of, humans, was, guided, for, example, by, god, according, to, david, kahan, of, the, university, of, glasgow, in, order, to, understand, how, beliefs, are, warranted, a, justification, must, be, found, in, the, context, of, supernatural, theism, as, in, plantinga, s, epistemology, see, also, supernormal, stimuli, plantinga, argues, that, together, naturalism, and, evolution, provide, an, insurmountable, defeater, for, the, belief, that, our, cognitive, faculties, are, reliable, i, e, a, skeptical, argument, along, the, lines, of, descartes, evil, demon, or, brain, in, a, vat, take, philosophical, naturalism, to, be, the, belief, that, there, aren, t, any, supernatural, entities, no, such, person, as, god, for, example, but, also, no, other, supernatural, entities, and, nothing, at, all, like, god, my, claim, was, that, naturalism, and, contemporary, evolutionary, theory, are, at, serious, odds, with, one, another, and, this, despite, the, fact, that, the, latter, is, ordinarily, thought, to, be, one, of, the, main, pillars, supporting, the, edifice, of, the, former, of, course, i, am, not, attacking, the, theory, of, evolution, or, anything, in, that, neighborhood, i, am, instead, attacking, the, conjunction, of, naturalism, with, the, view, that, human, beings, have, evolved, in, that, way, i, see, no, similar, problems, with, the, conjunction, of, theism, and, the, idea, that, human, beings, have, evolved, in, the, way, contemporary, evolutionary, science, suggests, more, particularly, i, argued, that, the, conjunction, of, naturalism, with, the, belief, that, we, human, beings, have, evolved, in, conformity, with, current, evolutionary, doctrine, is, in, a, certain, interesting, way, self, defeating, or, self, referentially, incoherent, the, argument, is, controversial, and, has, been, criticized, as, seriously, flawed, for, example, by, elliott, sober, robert, t, pennock, states, that, as, supernatural, agents, and, powers, are, above, and, beyond, the, natural, world, and, its, agents, and, powers, and, are, not, constrained, by, natural, laws, only, logical, impossibilities, constrain, what, a, supernatural, agent, cannot, do, he, says, if, we, could, apply, natural, knowledge, to, understand, supernatural, powers, then, by, definition, they, would, not, be, supernatural, as, the, supernatural, is, necessarily, a, mystery, to, us, it, can, provide, no, grounds, on, which, one, can, judge, scientific, models, experimentation, requires, observation, and, control, of, the, variables, but, by, definition, we, have, no, control, over, supernatural, entities, or, forces, science, does, not, deal, with, meanings, the, closed, system, of, scientific, reasoning, cannot, be, used, to, define, itself, allowing, science, to, appeal, to, untestable, supernatural, powers, would, make, the, scientist, s, task, meaningless, undermine, the, discipline, that, allows, science, to, make, progress, and, would, be, as, profoundly, unsatisfying, as, the, ancient, greek, playwright, s, reliance, upon, the, deus, ex, machina, to, extract, his, hero, from, a, difficult, predicament, naturalism, of, this, sort, says, nothing, about, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, the, supernatural, which, by, this, definition, is, beyond, natural, testing, as, a, practical, consideration, the, rejection, of, supernatural, explanations, would, merely, be, pragmatic, thus, it, would, nonetheless, be, possible, for, an, ontological, supernaturalist, to, espouse, and, practice, methodological, naturalism, for, example, scientists, may, believe, in, god, while, practicing, methodological, naturalism, in, their, scientific, work, this, position, does, not, preclude, knowledge, that, is, somehow, connected, to, the, supernatural, generally, however, anything, that, one, can, examine, and, explain, scientifically, would, not, be, supernatural, simply, by, definition, the, australian, philosopher, colin, murray, turbayne, puts, forth, an, objection, to, naturalism, which, is, based, upon, linguistic, grounds, his, objections, refer, to, several, of, the, concepts, which, form, the, a, priori, foundation, for, naturalism, in, general, in, particular, turbayne, calls, attention, to, the, concepts, of, substance, and, substratum, which, in, his, view, convey, little, if, any, meaning, at, best, he, asserts, that, along, with, several, physicalist, constructs, these, concepts, have, been, mistakenly, incorporated, through, the, use, of, deductive, reasoning, into, the, hypotheses, underlying, materialism, in, the, modern, world, in, addition, he, argues, further, that, they, are, more, properly,
