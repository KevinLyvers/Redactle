forbidden, by, the, catholic, church, christian, burials, have, traditionally, occurred, on, consecrated, ground, such, as, in, churchyards, there, are, many, funeral, norms, like, in, christianity, to, follow, burial, rather, than, a, destructive, process, such, as, cremation, was, the, traditional, practice, amongst, christians, because, of, the, belief, in, the, resurrection, of, the, body, cremations, later, came, into, widespread, use, although, some, denominations, forbid, them, the, us, conference, of, catholic, bishops, said, the, church, earnestly, recommends, that, the, pious,

performed, in, harmony, with, the, sacred, premise, that, the, microcosm, of, all, living, beings, is, a, reflection, of, a, macrocosm, of, the, universe, the, soul, atman, brahman, is, believed, to, be, the, immortal, essence, that, is, released, at, the, antyeshti, ritual, but, both, the, body, and, the, universe, are, vehicles, and, transitory, in, various, schools, of, hinduism, they, consist, of, five, elements, air, water, fire, earth, and, space, the, last, rite, of, passage, returns, the, body, to, the, five, elements, and, origins, the, roots, of, this, belief, are, found, in, the, vedas, for, example, in, the, hymns, of, rigveda, in, section, 10, 16, as, follows, burn, him, not, up, nor, quite, consume, him, agni, let, not, his, body, or, his, skin, be, scattered, o, all, possessing, fire, when, thou, hast, matured, him, then, send, him, on, his, way, unto, the, fathers, when, thou, hast, made, him, ready, all, possessing, fire, then, do, thou, give, him, over, to, the, fathers, when, he, attains, unto, the, life, that, waits, him, he, shall, become, subject, to, the, will, of, gods, the, sun, receive, thine, eye, the, wind, thy, prana, life, principle, breathe, go, as, thy, merit, is, to, earth, or, heaven, go, if, it, be, thy, lot, unto, the, waters, go, make, thine, home, in, plants, with, all, thy, members, the, final, rites, of, a, burial, in, case, of, untimely, death, of, a, child, is, rooted, in, rigveda, s, section, 10, 18, where, the, hymns, mourn, the, death, of, the, child, praying, to, deity, mrityu, to, neither, harm, our, girls, nor, our, boys, and, pleads, the, earth, to, cover, protect, the, deceased, child, as, a, soft, wool, among, hindus, the, dead, body, is, usually, cremated, within, a, day, of, death, the, body, is, washed, wrapped, in, white, cloth, for, a, man, or, a, widow, red, for, a, married, woman, the, two, toes, tied, together, with, a, string, a, tilak, red, mark, placed, on, the, forehead, the, dead, adult, s, body, is, carried, to, the, cremation, ground, near, a, river, or, water, by, family, and, friends, and, placed, on, a, pyre, with, feet, facing, south, the, eldest, son, or, a, male, mourner, or, a, priest, then, bathes, before, leading, the, cremation, ceremonial, function, he, circumambulates, the, dry, wood, pyre, with, the, body, says, a, eulogy, or, recites, a, hymn, in, some, cases, places, sesame, seed, in, the, dead, person, s, mouth, sprinkles, the, body, and, the, pyre, with, ghee, clarified, butter, then, draws, three, lines, signifying, yama, deity, of, the, dead, kala, time, deity, of, cremation, and, the, dead, the, pyre, is, then, set, ablaze, while, the, mourners, mourn, the, ash, from, the, cremation, is, consecrated, to, the, nearest, river, or, sea, after, the, cremation, a, period, of, mourning, is, observed, for, 10, to, 12, days, after, which, the, immediate, male, relatives, or, the, sons, of, the, deceased, shave, their, head, trim, their, nails, recites, prayers, with, the, help, of, priest, or, brahmin, and, invite, all, relatives, kins, friends, and, neighbours, to, eat, a, simple, meal, together, in, remembrance, of, the, deceased, this, day, in, some, communities, also, marks, a, day, when, the, poor, and, needy, are, offered, food, in, memory, of, the, dead, the, belief, that, bodies, are, infested, by, nasu, upon, death, greatly, influenced, zoroastrian, burial, ceremonies, and, funeral, rites, burial, and, cremation, of, corpses, was, prohibited, as, such, acts, would, defile, the, sacred, creations, of, earth, and, fire, respectively, burial, of, corpses, was, so, looked, down, upon, that, the, exhumation, of, buried, corpses, was, regarded, as, meritorious, for, these, reasons, towers, of, silence, were, developed, open, air, amphitheater, like, structures, in, which, corpses, were, placed, so, carrion, eating, birds, could, feed, on, them, sagd, d, meaning, seen, by, a, dog, is, a, ritual, that, must, be, performed, as, promptly, after, death, as, possible, the, dog, is, able, to, calculate, the, degree, of, evil, within, the, corpse, and, entraps, the, contamination, so, it, may, not, spread, further, expelling, nasu, from, the, body, nasu, remains, within, the, corpse, until, it, has, been, seen, by, a, dog, or, until, it, has, been, consumed, by, a, dog, or, a, carrion, eating, bird, according, to, chapter, 31, of, the, denkard, the, reasoning, for, the, required, consumption, of, corpses, is, that, the, evil, influences, of, nasu, are, contained, within, the, corpse, until, upon, being, digested, the, body, is, changed, from, the, form, of, nasa, into, nourishment, for, animals, the, corpse, is, thereby, delivered, over, to, the, animals, changing, from, the, state, of, corrupted, nasa, to, that, of, hixr, which, is, dry, dead, matter, considered, to, be, less, polluting, a, path, through, which, a, funeral, procession, has, traveled, must, not, be, passed, again, as, nasu, haunts, the, area, thereafter, until, the, proper, rites, of, banishment, are, performed, nasu, is, expelled, from, the, area, only, after, a, yellow, dog, with, four, eyes, or, a, white, dog, with, yellow, ears, is, walked, through, the, path, three, times, if, the, dog, goes, unwillingly, down, the, path, it, must, be, walked, back, and, forth, up, to, nine, times, to, ensure, that, nasu, has, been, driven, off, zoroastrian, ritual, exposure, of, the, dead, is, first, known, of, from, the, writings, of, the, mid, 5th, century, bce, herodotus, who, observed, the, custom, amongst, iranian,

variety, of, lawmakers, often, the, pomp, and, length, of, rites, could, be, politically, or, socially, motivated, to, advertise, or, aggrandise, a, particular, kin, group, in, roman, society, this, was, seen, as, deleterious, to, society, and, conditions, for, grieving, were, set, for, instance, under, some, laws, women, were, prohibited, from, loud, wailing, or, lacerating, their, faces, and, limits, were, introduced, for, expenditure, on, tombs, and, burial, clothes, the, romans, commonly, built, tombs, for, themselves, during, their, lifetime, hence, these, words, frequently, occur, in, ancient, inscriptions, v, f, vivus, facit, v, s, p, vivus, sibi, posuit, the, tombs, of, the, rich, usually, were, constructed, of, marble, the, ground, enclosed, with, walls, and, planted, around, with, trees, but, common, sepulchres, usually, were, built, below, ground, and, called, hypogea, there, were, niches, cut, out, of, the, walls, in, which, the, urns, were, placed, these, from, their, resemblance, to, the, niche, of, a, pigeon, house, were, called, columbaria, within, the, united, states, and, canada, in, most, cultural, groups, and, regions, the, funeral, rituals, can, be, divided, into, three, parts, visitation, funeral, and, the, burial, service, a, home, funeral, services, prepared, and, conducted, by, the, family, with, little, or, no, involvement, from, professionals, is, legal, in, nearly, every, part, of, north, america, but, in, the, 21st, century, they, are, uncommon, in, the, us, at, the, visitation, also, called, a, viewing, wake, or, calling, hours, in, christian, or, secular, western, custom, the, body, of, the, deceased, person, or, decedent, is, placed, on, display, in, the, casket, also, called, a, coffin, however, almost, all, body, containers, are, caskets, the, viewing, often, takes, place, on, one, or, two, evenings, before, the, funeral, in, the, past, it, was, common, practice, to, place, the, casket, in, the, decedent, s, home, or, that, of, a, relative, for, viewing, this, practice, continues, in, many, areas, of, ireland, and, scotland, the, body, is, traditionally, dressed, in, the, decedent, s, best, clothes, in, recent, times, there, has, been, more, variation, in, what, the, decedent, is, dressed, in, some, people, choose, to, be, dressed, in, clothing, more, reflective, of, how, they, dressed, in, life, the, body, will, often, be, adorned, with, common, jewelry, such, as, watches, necklaces, brooches, etc, the, jewelry, may, be, taken, off, and, given, to, the, family, of, the, deceased, prior, to, burial, or, be, buried, with, the, deceased, jewelry, has, to, be, removed, before, cremation, in, order, to, prevent, damage, to, the, crematory, the, body, may, or, may, not, be, embalmed, depending, upon, such, factors, as, the, amount, of, time, since, the, death, has, occurred, religious, practices, or, requirements, of, the, place, of, burial, the, most, commonly, prescribed, aspects, of, this, gathering, are, that, the, attendees, sign, a, book, kept, by, the, deceased, s, survivors, to, record, who, attended, in, addition, a, family, may, choose, to, display, photographs, taken, of, the, deceased, person, during, his, her, life, often, formal, portraits, with, other, family, members, and, candid, pictures, to, show, happy, times, prized, possessions, and, other, items, representing, his, her, hobbies, and, or, accomplishments, a, more, recent, trend, is, to, create, a, dvd, with, pictures, and, video, of, the, deceased, accompanied, by, music, and, play, this, dvd, continuously, during, the, visitation, the, viewing, is, either, open, casket, in, which, the, embalmed, body, of, the, deceased, has, been, clothed, and, treated, with, cosmetics, for, display, or, closed, casket, in, which, the, coffin, is, closed, the, coffin, may, be, closed, if, the, body, was, too, badly, damaged, because, of, an, accident, or, fire, or, other, trauma, deformed, from, illness, if, someone, in, the, group, is, emotionally, unable, to, cope, with, viewing, the, corpse, or, if, the, deceased, did, not, wish, to, be, viewed, in, cases, such, as, these, a, picture, of, the, deceased, usually, a, formal, photo, is, placed, atop, the, casket, however, this, step, is, foreign, to, judaism, jewish, funerals, are, held, soon, after, death, preferably, within, a, day, or, two, unless, more, time, is, needed, for, relatives, to, come, and, the, corpse, is, never, displayed, torah, law, forbids, embalming, traditionally, flowers, and, music, are, not, sent, to, a, grieving, jewish, family, as, it, is, a, reminder, of, the, life, that, is, now, lost, the, jewish, shiva, tradition, discourages, family, members, from, cooking, so, food, is, brought, by, friends, and, neighbors, see, also, jewish, bereavement, the, decedent, s, closest, friends, and, relatives, who, are, unable, to, attend, frequently, send, flowers, to, the, viewing, with, the, exception, of, a, jewish, funeral, where, flowers, would, not, be, appropriate, donations, are, often, given, to, a, charity, instead, obituaries, sometimes, contain, a, request, that, attendees, do, not, send, flowers, e, g, in, lieu, of, flowers, the, use, of, these, phrases, has, been, on, the, rise, for, the, past, century, in, the, us, in, 1927, only, 6, of, the, obituaries, included, the, directive, with, only, 2, of, those, mentioned, charitable, contributions, instead, by, the, middle, of, the, century, they, had, grown, to, 15, with, over, 54, of, those, noting, a, charitable, contribution, as, the, preferred, method, of, expressing, sympathy, the, deceased, is, usually, transported, from, the, funeral, home, to, a, church, in, a, hearse, a, specialized, vehicle, designed, to, carry, casketed, remains, the, deceased, is, often, transported, in, a, procession, also, called, a, funeral, cort, ge, with, the, hearse, funeral, service, vehicles, and, private, automobiles, traveling, in, a, procession, to, the, church, or, other, location, where, the, services, will, be, held, in, a, number, of, jurisdictions, special, laws, cover, funeral, processions, such, as, requiring, most, other, vehicles, to, give, right, of, way, to, a, funeral, procession, funeral, service, vehicles, may, be, equipped, with, light, bars, and, special, flashers, to, increase, their, visibility, on, the, roads, they, may, also, all, have, their, headlights, on, to, identify, which, vehicles, are, part, of, the, cortege, although, the, practice, also, has, roots, in, ancient, roman, customs, after, the, funeral, service, if, the, deceased, is, to, be, buried, the, funeral, procession, will, proceed, to, a, cemetery, if, not, already, there, if, the, deceased, is, to, be, cremated, the, funeral, procession, may, then, proceed, to, the, crematorium, funeral, customs, vary, from, country, to, country, in, the, united, states, any, type, of, noise, other, than, quiet, whispering, or, mourning, is, considered, disrespectful, a, burial, tends, to, cost, more, than, a, cremation, at, a, religious, burial, service, conducted, at, the, side, of, the, grave, tomb, mausoleum, or, cremation, the, body, of, the, decedent, is, buried, or, cremated, at, the, conclusion, sometimes, the, burial, service, will, immediately, follow, the, funeral, in, which, case, a, funeral, procession, travels, from, the, site, of, the, funeral, to, the, burial, site, in, some, other, cases, the, burial, service, is, the, funeral, in, which, case, the, procession, might, travel, from, the, cemetery, office, to, the, grave, site, other, times, the, burial, service, takes, place, at, a, later, time, when, the, final, resting, place, is, ready, if, the, death, occurred, in, the, middle, of, winter, if, the, decedent, served, in, a, branch, of, the, armed, forces, military, rites, are, often, accorded, at, the, burial, service, in, many, religious, traditions, pallbearers, usually, males, who, are, relatives, or, friends, of, the, decedent, will, carry, the, casket, from, the, chapel, of, a, funeral, home, or, church, to, the, hearse, and, from, the, hearse, to, the, site, of, the, burial, service, most, religions, expect, coffins, to, be, kept, closed, during, the, burial, ceremony, in, eastern, orthodox, funerals, the, coffins, are, reopened, just, before, burial, to, allow, mourners, to, look, at, the, deceased, one, last, time, and, give, their, final, farewells, greek, funerals, are, an, exception, as, the, coffin, is, open, during, the, whole, procedure, unless, the, state, of, the, body, does, not, allow, it, morticians, may, ensure, that, all, jewelry, including, wristwatch, that, were, displayed, at, the, wake, are, in, the, casket, before, it, is, buried, or, entombed, custom, requires, that, everything, goes, into, the, ground, however, this, is, not, true, for, jewish, services, jewish, tradition, stipulates, that, nothing, of, value, is, buried, with, the, deceased, in, the, case, of, cremation, such, items, are, usually, removed, before, the, body, goes, into, the, furnace, pacemakers, are, removed, prior, to, cremation, if, left, in, they, could, explode, funerals, for, indigenous, people, like, many, other, cultures, are, a, method, to, remember, commemorate, and, respect, the, dead, through, their, own, cultural, practices, and, traditions, in, the, past, there, has, been, scrutiny, when, the, topic, of, indigenous, funeral, sites, was, approached, thus, the, federal, government, deemed, it, necessary, to, include, a, series, of, acts, that, would, protect, and, accurately, affiliate, some, of, these, burials, with, their, correct, native, individuals, or, groups, this, was, enacted, through, the, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, furthermore, in, 2001, california, created, the, california, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, that, would, require, all, state, agencies, and, museums, that, receive, state, funding, and, that, have, possession, or, control, over, collections, of, humans, remains, or, cultural, items, to, provide, a, process, for, identification, and, repatriates, of, these, items, to, appropriate, tribes, in, 2020, it, was, amended, to, include, tribes, that, were, beyond, state, and, federal, knowledge, in, the, ipai, tipai, paipai, and, kiliwa, regions, funeral, practices, are, similar, in, their, social, and, power, dynamics, the, way, that, these, funeral, sites, were, created, was, based, on, previous, habitation, meaning, these, were, sites, were, their, peoples, may, have, died, or, if, they, had, been, a, temporary, home, for, some, of, these, groups, additionally, these, individual, burials, were, characterized, by, grave, markers, and, or, grave, offerings, the, markers, included, inverted, metates, fractured, pieces, of, metates, as, well, as, cairns, as, for, offerings, food, shell, and, stone, beads, were, often, found, in, burial, mounds, along, with, portions, human, remains, the, state, of, the, human, remains, found, at, the, site, can, vary, data, suggests, that, cremations, are, recent, in, prehistory, compared, to, just, burials, ranging, from, the, middle, holocene, era, to, the, late, prehistoric, period, additionally, the, position, these, people, were, placed, in, plays, a, role, in, how, the, afterlife, was, viewed, with, recent, ethnographic, evidence, coming, from, the, yuman, people, it, is, believed, that, the, spirits, of, the, dead, could, potentially, harm, the, living, so, they, would, often, layer, the, markers, or, offerings, above, the, body, so, that, they, would, be, unable, to, leave, their, graves, and, enact, harm, in, the, los, angeles, basin, researchers, discovered, communal, mourning, features, at, west, bluffs, and, landing, hill, these, communal, mourning, rituals, were, estimated, to, have, taken, place, during, the, intermediate, period, 3, 000, 1, 000, b, p, archaeologists, have, found, fragmented, pieces, of, a, large, schist, pestle, which, was, deliberately, broken, in, a, methodical, way,

custom, in, the, region, for, thousands, of, years, for, the, purpose, of, releasing, the, spirit, within, the, object, reducing, harm, to, the, community, or, as, an, expression, of, grief, pigmentation, of, grave, goods, also, has, many, interpretations, the, chumash, associate, the, color, red, with, both, earth, and, fire, while, some, researchers, consider, the, usage, of, the, red, pigment, as, an, important, transitional, moment, in, the, adult, life, cycle, a, memorial, service, is, one, given, for, the, deceased, often, without, the, body, present, the, service, takes, place, after, cremation, or, burial, at, sea, after, donation, of, the, body, to, an, academic, or, research, institution, or, after, the, ashes, have, been, scattered, it, is, also, significant, when, the, person, is, missing, and, presumed, dead, or, known, to, be, deceased, though, the, body, is, not, recoverable, these, services, often, take, place, at, a, funeral, home, however, they, can, be, held,

ceremonies, a, main, funeral, and, a, shorter, committal, ceremony, in, the, latter, the, coffin, is, either, handed, over, to, a, crematorium, or, buried, in, a, cemetery, this, allows, the, funeral, to, be, held, at, a, place, without, cremation, or, burial, facilities, alternatively, the, entire, funeral, may, be, held, in, the, chapel, of, the, crematorium, or, cemetery, it, is, not, customary,
