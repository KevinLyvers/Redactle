witchcraft, as, most, commonly, understood, in, both, historical, and, present, day, communities, is, the, use, of, alleged, supernatural, powers, of, magic, a, witch, is, a, practitioner, of, witchcraft, traditionally, witchcraft, means, the, use, of, magic, or, supernatural, powers, to, inflict, harm, or, misfortune, on, others, and, this, remains, the, most, common, and, widespread, meaning, according, to, encyclopedia, britannica, witchcraft, thus, defined, exists, more, in, the, imagination, of, contemporaries, than, in, any, objective, reality, yet, this, stereotype, has, a, long, history, and, has, constituted, for, many, cultures, a, viable, explanation, of, evil, in, the, world, the, belief, in, witchcraft, has, been, found, in, a, great, number, of, societies, worldwide, anthropologists, have, applied, the, english, term, witchcraft, to, similar, beliefs, in, occult, practices, in, many, different, cultures, and, societies, that, have, adopted, the, english, language, have, often, internalised, the, term, in, europe, belief, in, witchcraft, traces, back, to, classical, antiquity, in, medieval, and, early, modern, europe, accused, witches, were, usually, women, who, were, believed, to, have, used, black, magic, or, maleficium, against, their, own, community, usually, accusations, of, witchcraft, were, made, by, their, neighbors, and, followed, from, social, tensions, witches, were, sometimes, said, to, have, communed, with, evil, beings, or, with, the, devil, though, anthropologist, jean, la, fontaine, notes, that, such, accusations, were, mainly, made, against, enemies, of, the, church, it, was, thought, witchcraft, could, be, thwarted, by, protective, magic, or, counter, magic, which, could, be, provided, by, the, cunning, folk, or, wise, people, suspected, witches, were, also, intimidated, banished, attacked, or, killed, often, they, would, be, formally, prosecuted, and, punished, if, found, guilty, or, simply, believed, to, be, guilty, european, witch, hunts, and, witch, trials, in, the, early, modern, period, led, to, tens, of, thousands, of, executions, while, magical, healers, and, midwives, were, sometimes, accused, of, witchcraft, themselves, they, made, up, a, minority, of, those, accused, european, belief, in, witchcraft, gradually, dwindled, during, and, after, the, age, of, enlightenment, many, indigenous, belief, systems, that, include, the, concept, of, witchcraft, likewise, define, witches, as, malevolent, and, seek, healers, and, medicine, people, for, protection, against, witchcraft, some, african, and, melanesian, peoples, believe, witches, are, driven, by, an, evil, spirit, or, substance, inside, them, modern, witch, hunting, takes, place, in, parts, of, africa, and, asia, today, followers, of, certain, types, of, modern, paganism, self, identify, as, witches, and, use, the, term, witchcraft, for, their, beliefs, and, practices, other, neo, pagans, avoid, the, term, due, to, its, negative, connotations, the, concept, of, witchcraft, and, the, belief, in, its, existence, have, persisted, throughout, recorded, history, according, to, the, united, nations, special, rapporteur, on, extrajudicial, summary, or, arbitrary, executions, there, is, difficulty, of, defining, witches, and, witchcraft, across, cultures, terms, that, quite, apart, from, their, connotations, in, popular, culture, may, include, an, array, of, traditional, or, faith, healing, practices, and, are, not, easily, defined, the, most, common, meaning, of, witchcraft, worldwide, is, the, use, of, harmful, magic, belief, in, malevolent, magic, has, been, found, in, cultures, worldwide, regardless, of, development, most, societies, have, feared, an, ability, by, some, individuals, to, cause, supernatural, harm, and, misfortune, to, others, this, may, come, from, mankind, s, tendency, to, want, to, assign, occurrences, of, remarkable, good, or, bad, luck, to, agency, either, human, or, superhuman, historians, and, anthropologists, see, the, concept, of, witchcraft, as, one, of, the, ways, humans, have, tried, to, explain, strange, misfortune, some, cultures, have, feared, witchcraft, much, less, than, others, because, they, tend, to, have, other, explanations, for, strange, misfortune, for, example, the, gaels, of, ireland, and, the, scottish, highlands, historically, held, a, strong, belief, in, fairy, folk, who, could, cause, supernatural, harm, and, witch, hunting, was, very, rare, in, these, regions, compared, to, other, regions, of, the, british, isles, historian, ronald, hutton, outlined, five, key, characteristics, ascribed, to, witches, and, witchcraft, by, most, cultures, that, believe, in, this, concept, the, use, of, magic, to, cause, harm, or, misfortune, to, others, it, was, used, by, the, witch, against, their, own, community, powers, of, witchcraft, were, believed, to, have, been, acquired, through, inheritance, or, initiation, it, was, seen, as, immoral, and, often, thought, to, involve, communion, with, evil, beings, and, witchcraft, could, be, thwarted, by, defensive, magic, persuasion, intimidation, or, physical, punishment, of, the, alleged, witch, it, is, commonly, believed, that, witches, use, objects, words, and, gestures, to, cause, supernatural, harm, or, that, they, simply, have, an, innate, power, to, do, so, hutton, notes, that, both, kinds, of, practitioners, are, often, believed, to, exist, in, the, same, culture, and, that, the, two, often, overlap, in, that, someone, with, an, inborn, power, could, wield, that, power, through, material, objects, one, of, the, most, influential, works, on, witchcraft, and, concepts, of, magic, was, e, e, evans, pritchard, s, witchcraft, oracles, and, magic, among, the, azande, a, study, of, azande, witchcraft, beliefs, published, in, 1937, this, provided, definitions, for, witchcraft, which, became, a, convention, in, anthropology, however, some, researchers, argue, that, the, general, adoption, of, evans, pritchard, s, definitions, constrained, discussion, of, witchcraft, beliefs, and, even, broader, discussion, of, magic, and, religion, in, ways, that, his, work, does, not, support, evans, pritchard, reserved, the, term, witchcraft, for, the, actions, of, those, who, inflict, harm, by, their, inborn, power, and, used, sorcery, for, those, who, needed, tools, to, do, so, historians, found, these, definitions, difficult, to, apply, to, european, witchcraft, where, witches, were, believed, to, use, physical, techniques, as, well, as, some, who, were, believed, to, cause, harm, by, thought, alone, the, distinction, has, now, largely, been, abandoned, although, some, anthropologists, still, sometimes, find, it, relevant, to, the, particular, societies, with, which, they, are, concerned, while, most, cultures, believe, witchcraft, to, be, something, willful, some, indigenous, peoples, in, africa, and, melanesia, believe, witches, have, a, substance, or, an, evil, spirit, in, their, bodies, that, drives, them, to, do, harm, however, such, substances, are, described, in, other, accounts, as, being, able, to, act, on, their, own, while, the, witch, is, sleeping, or, unaware, the, dobu, people, believe, women, work, harmful, magic, in, their, sleep, while, men, work, it, while, awake, further, in, cultures, where, substances, within, the, body, are, believed, to, grant, supernatural, powers, the, substance, may, be, good, bad, or, morally, neutral, hutton, draws, a, distinction, between, those, who, unwittingly, cast, the, evil, eye, and, those, who, deliberately, do, so, describing, only, the, latter, as, witches, the, universal, or, cross, cultural, validity, of, these, terms, are, debated, hutton, states, is, however, only, one, current, usage, of, the, word, in, fact, anglo, american, senses, of, it, now, take, at, least, four, different, forms, although, the, one, discussed, above, seems, still, to, be, the, most, widespread, and, frequent, the, others, define, the, witch, figure, as, any, person, who, uses, magic, or, as, the, practitioner, of, nature, based, pagan, religion, or, as, a, symbol, of, independent, female, authority, and, resistance, to, male, domination, all, have, validity, in, the, present, anthropologist, fiona, bowie, notes, that, the, terms, witchcraft, and, witch, are, used, differently, by, scholars, and, the, general, public, in, at, least, four, different, ways, that, must, be, treated, separately, neopagan, writer, isaac, bonewits, proposed, dividing, witches, into, even, more, distinct, types, including, but, not, limited, to, neopagan, feminist, neogothic, neoclassical, classical, family, traditions, immigrant, traditions, and, ethnic, the, word, is, over, a, thousand, years, old, old, english, formed, the, compound, wiccecr, ft, from, wicce, witch, and, cr, ft, craft, the, masculine, form, was, wicca, male, sorcerer, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, wicce, and, wicca, were, probably, derived, from, the, old, english, verb, wiccian, meaning, to, practice, witchcraft, wiccian, has, a, cognate, in, middle, low, german, wicken, attested, from, the, 13th, century, the, further, etymology, of, this, word, is, problematic, it, has, no, clear, cognates, in, other, germanic, languages, outside, of, english, and, low, german, and, there, are, numerous, possibilities, for, the, indo, european, root, from, which, it, may, have, derived, another, old, english, word, for, witch, was, h, gtes, or, h, gtesse, which, became, the, modern, english, word, hag, and, is, linked, to, the, word, hex, in, most, other, germanic, languages, their, word, for, witch, comes, from, the, same, root, as, these, for, example, german, hexe, and, dutch, heks, in, colloquial, modern, english, the, word, witch, is, particularly, used, for, women, a, male, practitioner, of, magic, or, witchcraft, is, more, commonly, called, a, wizard, or, sometimes, warlock, when, the, word, witch, is, used, to, refer, to, a, member, of, a, neo, pagan, tradition, or, religion, such, as, wicca, it, can, refer, to, a, person, of, any, gender, witches, are, commonly, believed, to, cast, curses, a, spell, or, set, of, magical, words, and, gestures, intended, to, inflict, supernatural, harm, cursing, could, also, involve, inscribing, runes, or, sigils, on, an, object, to, give, that, object, magical, powers, burning, or, binding, a, wax, or, clay, image, a, poppet, of, a, person, to, affect, them, magically, or, using, herbs, animal, parts, and, other, substances, to, make, potions, or, poisons, witchcraft, has, been, blamed, for, many, kinds, of, misfortune, in, europe, by, far, the, most, common, kind, of, harm, attributed, to, witchcraft, was, illness, or, death, suffered, by, adults, their, children, or, their, animals, certain, ailments, like, impotence, in, men, infertility, in, women, and, lack, of, milk, in, cows, were, particularly, associated, with, witchcraft, illnesses, that, were, poorly, understood, were, more, likely, to, be, blamed, on, witchcraft, edward, bever, writes, witchcraft, was, particularly, likely, to, be, suspected, when, a, disease, came, on, unusually, swiftly, lingered, unusually, long, could, not, be, diagnosed, clearly, or, presented, some, other, unusual, symptoms, a, common, belief, in, cultures, worldwide, is, that, witches, tend, to, use, something, from, their, target, s, body, to, work, magic, against, them, for, example, hair, nail, clippings, clothing, or, bodily, waste, such, beliefs, are, found, in, europe, africa, south, asia, polynesia, melanesia, and, north, america, another, widespread, belief, among, indigenous, peoples, in, africa, and, north, america, is, that, witches, cause, harm, by, introducing, cursed, magical, objects, into, their, victim, s, body, such, as, small, bones, or, ashes, james, george, frazer, described, this, kind, of, magic, as, imitative, in, some, cultures, witches, are, believed, to, use, human, body, parts, in, magic, and, they, are, commonly, believed, to, murder, children, for, this, purpose, in, europe, cases, in, which, women, did, undoubtedly, kill, their, children, because, of, what, today, would, be, called, postpartum, psychosis, were, often, interpreted, as, yielding, to, diabolical, temptation, witches, are, believed, to, work, in, secret, sometimes, alone, and, sometimes, with, other, witches, hutton, writes, across, most, of, the, world, witches, have, been, thought, to, gather, at, night, when, normal, humans, are, inactive, and, also, at, their, most, vulnerable, in, sleep, in, most, cultures, witches, at, these, gatherings, are, thought, to, transgress, social, norms, by, engaging, in, cannibalism, incest, and, open, nudity, witches, around, the, world, commonly, have, associations, with, animals, rodney, needham, identified, this, as, a, defining, feature, of, the, witch, archetype, in, some, parts, of, the, world, it, is, believed, witches, can, shapeshift, into, animals, or, that, the, witch, s, spirit, travels, apart, from, their, body, and, takes, an, animal, form, an, activity, often, associated, with, shamanism, another, widespread, belief, is, that, witches, have, an, animal, helper, in, english, these, are, often, called, familiars, and, meant, an, evil, spirit, or, demon, that, had, taken, an, animal, form, as, researchers, examined, traditions, in, other, regions, they, widened, the, term, to, servant, spirit, animals, which, are, described, as, a, part, of, the, witch, s, own, soul, necromancy, is, the, practice, of, conjuring, the, spirits, of, the, dead, for, divination, or, prophecy, although, the, term, has, also, been, applied, to, raising, the, dead, for, other, purposes, the, biblical, witch, of, endor, performed, it, 1, samuel, 28th, chapter, and, it, is, among, the, witchcraft, practices, condemned, by, lfric, of, eynsham, witches, still, go, to, cross, roads, and, to, heathen, burials, with, their, delusive, magic, and, call, to, the, devil, and, he, comes, to, them, in, the, likeness, of, the, man, that, is, buried, there, as, if, he, arises, from, death, most, societies, that, have, believed, in, harmful, or, black, magic, have, also, believed, in, helpful, magic, some, have, called, it, white, magic, at, least, in, more, recent, times, where, belief, in, harmful, magic, exists, its, use, is, typically, forbidden, by, law, as, well, as, hated, and, feared, by, the, general, populace, while, helpful, white, or, apotropaic, magic, is, tolerated, or, even, accepted, wholesale, by, the, population, even, if, the, orthodox, establishment, opposes, it, in, these, societies, practitioners, of, helpful, magic, usually, known, as, cunning, folk, have, traditionally, provided, services, such, as, breaking, the, effects, of, witchcraft, healing, divination, finding, lost, or, stolen, goods, and, love, magic, in, britain, and, some, other, parts, of, europe, they, were, commonly, known, as, cunning, folk, or, wise, people, alan, mcfarlane, wrote, that, while, cunning, folk, is, the, usual, name, some, are, also, known, as, blessers, or, wizards, but, might, also, be, known, as, white, good, or, unbinding, witches, historian, owen, davies, says, the, term, white, witch, was, rarely, used, before, the, 20th, century, ronald, hutton, uses, the, general, term, service, magicians, often, these, people, were, involved, in, identifying, alleged, witches, such, helpful, magic, workers, were, normally, contrasted, with, the, witch, who, practiced, maleficium, that, is, magic, used, for, harmful, ends, in, the, early, years, of, the, witch, hunts, the, cunning, folk, were, widely, tolerated, by, church, state, and, general, populace, some, of, the, more, hostile, churchmen, and, secular, authorities, tried, to, smear, folk, healers, and, magic, workers, by, falsely, branding, them, witches, and, associating, them, with, harmful, witchcraft, but, generally, the, masses, did, not, accept, this, and, continued, to, make, use, of, their, services, the, english, mp, and, skeptic, reginald, scot, sought, to, disprove, magic, and, witchcraft, writing, in, the, discoverie, of, witchcraft, 1584, at, this, day, it, is, indifferent, to, say, in, the, english, tongue, she, is, a, witch, or, she, is, a, wise, woman, historian, keith, thomas, adds, nevertheless, it, is, possible, to, isolate, that, kind, of, witchcraft, which, involved, the, employment, or, presumed, employment, of, some, occult, means, of, doing, harm, to, other, people, in, a, way, which, was, generally, disapproved, of, in, this, sense, the, belief, in, witchcraft, can, be, defined, as, the, attribution, of, misfortune, to, occult, human, agency, emma, wilby, says, folk, magicians, in, europe, were, viewed, ambivalently, by, communities, and, were, considered, as, capable, of, harming, as, of, healing, which, could, lead, to, their, being, accused, as, malevolent, witches, she, suggests, some, english, witches, convicted, of, consorting, with, demons, may, have, been, cunning, folk, whose, supposed, fairy, familiars, had, been, demonised, hutton, says, that, healers, and, cunning, folk, were, sometimes, denounced, as, witches, but, seem, to, have, made, up, a, minority, of, the, accused, in, any, area, studied, likewise, davies, says, relatively, few, cunning, folk, were, prosecuted, under, secular, statutes, for, witchcraft, and, were, dealt, with, more, leniently, than, alleged, witches, the, constitutio, criminalis, carolina, 1532, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, danish, witchcraft, act, of, 1617, stated, that, workers, of, folk, magic, should, be, dealt, with, differently, from, witches, it, was, suggested, by, richard, horsley, that, cunning, folk, devins, guerisseurs, diviner, healers, made, up, a, significant, proportion, of, those, tried, for, witchcraft, in, france, and, switzerland, but, more, recent, surveys, conclude, that, they, made, up, less, than, 2, of, the, accused, however, va, p, cs, says, that, half, the, accused, witches, in, hungary, seem, to, have, been, healers, and, kathleen, stokker, says, the, vast, majority, of, norway, s, accused, witches, were, folk, healers, societies, that, believed, in, witchcraft, also, believed, that, it, could, be, thwarted, in, various, ways, one, common, way, was, to, use, protective, magic, or, counter, magic, of, which, the, cunning, folk, were, experts, this, included, charms, talismans, and, amulets, anti, witch, marks, witch, bottles, witch, balls, and, burying, objects, such, as, horse, skulls, inside, the, walls, of, buildings, another, believed, cure, for, bewitchment, was, to, persuade, or, force, the, alleged, witch, to, lift, their, spell, often, people, would, attempt, to, thwart, the, witchcraft, by, physically, punishing, the, alleged, witch, such, as, by, banishing, wounding, torturing, or, killing, them, in, most, societies, however, a, formal, and, legal, remedy, was, preferred, to, this, sort, of, private, action, whereby, the, alleged, witch, would, be, prosecuted, and, then, formally, punished, if, found, guilty, this, often, resulted, in, execution, throughout, the, world, accusations, of, witchcraft, are, often, linked, to, social, and, economic, tensions, females, are, most, often, accused, but, in, some, cultures, it, is, mostly, males, in, many, societies, accusations, are, directed, mainly, against, the, elderly, but, in, others, age, is, not, a, factor, and, in, some, cultures, it, is, mainly, adolescents, who, are, accused, va, p, cs, writes, that, reasons, for, accusations, of, witchcraft, fall, into, four, general, categories, the, first, three, of, which, were, proposed, by, richard, kieckhefer, and, the, fourth, added, by, christina, larner, witch, hunts, scapegoating, and, the, shunning, or, murder, of, suspected, witches, still, occurs, many, cultures, worldwide, continue, to, have, a, belief, in, the, concept, of, witchcraft, or, malevolent, magic, apart, from, extrajudicial, violence, state, sanctioned, violence, also, occurs, in, some, jurisdictions, for, instance, in, saudi, arabia, practicing, witchcraft, and, sorcery, is, a, crime, punishable, by, death, and, the, country, has, executed, people, for, this, crime, in, 2011, 2012, and, 2014, witchcraft, related, violence, is, often, discussed, as, a, serious, issue, in, the, broader, context, of, violence, against, women, in, tanzania, an, estimated, 500, older, women, are, murdered, each, year, following, accusations, of, witchcraft, or, accusations, of, being, a, witch, according, to, a, 2014, world, health, organization, report, children, who, live, in, some, regions, of, the, world, such, as, parts, of, africa, are, also, vulnerable, to, violence, that, is, related, to, witchcraft, accusations, such, incidents, have, also, occurred, in, immigrant, communities, in, the, uk, including, the, much, publicized, case, of, the, murder, of, victoria, climbi, working, magic, was, widely, accepted, and, deeply, integrated, into, the, religion, and, the, wider, mesopotamian, society, according, to, tzvi, abusch, the, early, stages, of, the, development, of, witchcraft, ip, or, ki, p, in, ancient, mesopotamia, were, comparable, to, the, archaic, shamanistic, stage, of, european, witchcraft, 65, 66, in, this, early, stage, witches, were, not, necessarily, considered, evil, but, took, white, and, black, forms, and, could, help, others, using, a, combination, of, magical, and, medical, knowledge, 65, 66, they, generally, lived, in, rural, areas, and, sometimes, exhibited, ecstatic, behavior, 65, 66, which, was, more, usually, associated, with, the, a, ipu, exorcist, whose, main, function, at, this, stage, of, development, was, to, battle, non, human, supernatural, forces, 65, 66, in, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, witches, m, ka, pu, f, ka, ptu, from, ka, pu, eventually, came, to, be, regarded, as, an, anti, social, and, illegitimate, practitioner, of, destructive, magic, whose, activities, were, motivated, by, malice, and, evil, intent, and, who, was, opposed, by, the, a, ipu, an, exorcist, or, incantation, priest, 65, 66, who, were, predominantly, male, representatives, of, the, official, state, religion, the, individuals, mentioned, in, records, of, mesopotamian, society, as, witches, tended, to, be, those, of, low, status, who, were, weak, or, otherwise, marginalized, including, women, foreigners, actors, and, peddlers, by, the, time, of, the, code, of, hammurabi, about, 2000, bce, the, use, of, magic, to, harm, others, without, justification, was, subject, to, legal, repercussions, if, a, man, has, put, a, spell, upon, another, man, and, it, is, not, justified, he, upon, whom, the, spell, is, laid, shall, go, to, the, holy, river, into, the, holy, river, shall, he, plunge, if, the, holy, river, overcome, him, and, he, is, drowned, the, man, who, put, the, spell, upon, him, shall, take, possession, of, his, house, if, the, holy, river, declares, him, innocent, and, he, remains, unharmed, the, man, who, laid, the, spell, shall, be, put, to, death, he, that, plunged, into, the, river, shall, take, possession, of, the, house, of, him, who, laid, the, spell, upon, him, the, a, ipu, in, their, continued, efforts, to, suppress, witchcraft, developed, an, akkadian, anti, witchcraft, ritual, the, maql, probably, composed, in, the, early, first, millennium, bce, during, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, of, han, 141, bce, to, 87, bce, in, the, western, han, dynasty, of, china, there, were, instances, where, the, imperial, court, took, measures, to, suppress, certain, religious, or, spiritual, practices, including, those, associated, with, shamanism, emperor, wu, was, known, for, his, strong, support, of, confucianism, which, was, the, dominant, ideology, of, the, han, dynasty, and, he, promoted, policies, that, aimed, to, consolidate, central, authority, and, unify, the, cultural, and, social, landscape, of, the, empire, one, notable, event, related, to, the, suppression, of, shamanism, occurred, in, 91, bce, when, emperor, wu, issued, an, edict, that, banned, a, range, of, heterodox, practices, including, shamanistic, rituals, and, divination, in, favor, of, confucianism, the, primary, target, of, these, measures, was, the, wuism, or, wu, tradition, which, involved, the, worship, of, spirits, and, the, use, of, shamanic, practices, to, communicate, with, them, wuism, was, considered, by, the, confucian, elite, to, be, superstitious, witchcraft, and, at, odds, with, confucian, principles, emperor, wu, s, suppression, of, shamanism, was, part, of, a, larger, effort, to, centralize, power, promote, confucian, ethics, and, standardize, cultural, practices, while, the, ban, on, shamanistic, practices, did, impact, certain, communities, and, religious, groups, these, measures, were, not, universally, applied, across, the, vast, territory, of, the, empire, local, variations, and, practices, persisted, in, some, regions, despite, imperial, edicts, the, historical, record, from, that, time, is, limited, and, our, understanding, of, these, events, can, be, influenced, by, the, perspectives, of, the, confucian, scholars, and, officials, who, documented, them, as, a, result, there, might, be, some, variations, in, the, interpretation, of, the, exact, nature, and, extent, of, the, expulsion, of, shamans, and, other, religious, practitioners, during, emperor, wu, s, reign, witchcraft, s, historical, evolution, in, the, middle, east, reveals, a, multi, phase, journey, influenced, by, culture, spirituality, and, societal, norms, ancient, witchcraft, in, the, near, east, intertwined, mysticism, with, nature, through, rituals, and, incantations, aligned, with, local, beliefs, in, ancient, judaism, magic, had, a, complex, relationship, with, some, forms, accepted, due, to, mysticism, while, others, were, considered, heretical, the, medieval, middle, east, experienced, shifting, perceptions, of, witchcraft, under, islamic, and, christian, influences, sometimes, revered, for, healing, and, other, times, condemned, as, heresy, jewish, attitudes, toward, witchcraft, were, rooted, in, its, association, with, idolatry, and, necromancy, and, some, rabbis, even, practiced, certain, forms, of, magic, themselves, references, to, witchcraft, in, the, tanakh, or, hebrew, bible, highlighted, strong, condemnations, rooted, in, the, abomination, of, magical, belief, christianity, similarly, condemned, witchcraft, considering, it, an, abomination, and, even, citing, specific, verses, to, justify, witch, hunting, during, the, early, modern, period, historically, the, christian, concept, of, witchcraft, derives, from, old, testament, laws, against, it, in,

murray, popularized, the, witch, cult, hypothesis, the, idea, that, those, persecuted, as, witches, in, early, modern, europe, were, followers, of, a, benevolent, pagan, religion, that, had, survived, the, christianization, of, europe, this, has, been, discredited, by, further, historical, research, from, the, 1930s, occult, neopagan, groups, began, to, emerge, who, called, their, religion, a,

represents, in, africa, has, been, susceptible, to, misunderstandings, and, confusion, thanks, in, no, small, part, to, a, tendency, among, western, scholars, since, the, time, of, the, now, largely,
