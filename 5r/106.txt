a, ritual, is, a, sequence, of, activities, involving, gestures, words, actions, or, revered, objects, rituals, may, be, prescribed, by, the, traditions, of, a, community, including, a, religious, community, rituals, are, characterized, but, not, defined, by, formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule, governance, sacral, symbolism, and, performance, rituals, are, a, feature, of, all, known, human, societies, they, include, not, only, the, worship, rites, and, sacraments, of, organized, religions, and, cults, but, also, rites, of, passage, atonement, and, purification, rites, oaths, of, allegiance, dedication, ceremonies, coronations, and, presidential, inaugurations, marriages, funerals, and, more, even, common, actions, like, hand, shaking, and, saying, hello, may, be, termed, as, rituals, the, field, of, ritual, studies, has, seen, a, number, of, conflicting, definitions, of, the, term, one, given, by, kyriakidis, is, that, a, ritual, is, an, outsider, s, or, etic, category, for, a, set, activity, or, set, of, actions, that, to, the, outsider, seems, irrational, non, contiguous, or, illogical, the, term, can, be, used, also, by, the, insider, or, emic, performer, as, an, acknowledgement, that, this, activity, can, be, seen, as, such, by, the, uninitiated, onlooker, in, psychology, the, term, ritual, is, sometimes, used, in, a, technical, sense, for, a, repetitive, behavior, systematically, used, by, a, person, to, neutralize, or, prevent, anxiety, it, can, be, a, symptom, of, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, but, obsessive, compulsive, ritualistic, behaviors, are, generally, isolated, activities, the, english, word, ritual, derives, from, the, latin, ritualis, that, which, pertains, to, rite, ritus, in, roman, juridical, and, religious, usage, ritus, was, the, proven, way, mos, of, doing, something, or, correct, performance, custom, the, original, concept, of, ritus, may, be, related, to, the, sanskrit, t, visible, order, in, vedic, religion, the, lawful, and, regular, order, of, the, normal, and, therefore, proper, natural, and, true, structure, of, cosmic, worldly, human, and, ritual, events, the, word, ritual, is, first, recorded, in, english, in, 1570, and, came, into, use, in, the, 1600s, to, mean, the, prescribed, order, of, performing, religious, services, or, more, particularly, a, book, of, these, prescriptions, there, are, hardly, any, limits, to, the, kind, of, actions, that, may, be, incorporated, into, a, ritual, the, rites, of, past, and, present, societies, have, typically, involved, special, gestures, and, words, recitation, of, fixed, texts, performance, of, special, music, songs, or, dances, processions, manipulation, of, certain, objects, use, of, special, dresses, consumption, of, special, food, drink, or, drugs, and, much, more, catherine, bell, argues, that, rituals, can, be, characterized, by, formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule, governance, sacral, symbolism, and, performance, ritual, uses, a, limited, and, rigidly, organized, set, of, expressions, which, anthropologists, call, a, restricted, code, in, opposition, to, a, more, open, elaborated, code, maurice, bloch, argues, that, ritual, obliges, participants, to, use, this, formal, oratorical, style, which, is, limited, in, intonation, syntax, vocabulary, loudness, and, fixity, of, order, in, adopting, this, style, ritual, leaders, speech, becomes, more, style, than, content, because, this, formal, speech, limits, what, can, be, said, it, induces, acceptance, compliance, or, at, least, forbearance, with, regard, to, any, overt, challenge, bloch, argues, that, this, form, of, ritual, communication, makes, rebellion, impossible, and, revolution, the, only, feasible, alternative, ritual, tends, to, support, traditional, forms, of, social, hierarchy, and, authority, and, maintains, the, assumptions, on, which, the, authority, is, based, from, challenge, rituals, appeal, to, tradition, and, are, generally, continued, to, repeat, historical, precedent, religious, rite, mores, or, ceremony, accurately, traditionalism, varies, from, formalism, in, that, the, ritual, may, not, be, formal, yet, still, makes, an, appeal, to, the, historical, trend, an, example, is, the, american, thanksgiving, dinner, which, may, not, be, formal, yet, is, ostensibly, based, on, an, event, from, the, early, puritan, settlement, of, america, historians, eric, hobsbawm, and, terrence, ranger, have, argued, that, many, of, these, are, invented, traditions, such, as, the, rituals, of, the, british, monarchy, which, invoke, thousand, year, old, tradition, but, whose, actual, form, originate, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, to, some, extent, reviving, earlier, forms, in, this, case, medieval, that, had, been, discontinued, in, the, meantime, thus, the, appeal, to, history, is, important, rather, than, accurate, historical, transmission, catherine, bell, states, that, ritual, is, also, invariant, implying, careful, choreography, this, is, less, an, appeal, to, traditionalism, than, a, striving, for, timeless, repetition, the, key, to, invariance, is, bodily, discipline, as, in, monastic, prayer, and, meditation, meant, to, mold, dispositions, and, moods, this, bodily, discipline, is, frequently, performed, in, unison, by, groups, rituals, tend, to, be, governed, by, rules, a, feature, somewhat, like, formalism, rules, impose, norms, on, the, chaos, of, behavior, either, defining, the, outer, limits, of, what, is, acceptable, or, choreographing, each, move, individuals, are, held, to, communally, approved, customs, that, evoke, a, legitimate, communal, authority, that, can, constrain, the, possible, outcomes, historically, war, in, most, societies, has, been, bound, by, highly, ritualized, constraints, that, limit, the, legitimate, means, by, which, war, was, waged, activities, appealing, to, supernatural, beings, are, easily, considered, rituals, although, the, appeal, may, be, quite, indirect, expressing, only, a, generalized, belief, in, the, existence, of, the, sacred, demanding, a, human, response, national, flags, for, example, may, be, considered, more, than, signs, representing, a, country, the, flag, stands, for, larger, symbols, such, as, freedom, democracy, free, enterprise, or, national, superiority, anthropologist, sherry, ortner, writes, that, the, flag, does, not, encourage, reflection, on, the, logical, relations, among, these, ideas, nor, on, the, logical, consequences, of, them, as, they, are, played, out, in, social, actuality, over, time, and, history, on, the, contrary, the, flag, encourages, a, sort, of, all, or, nothing, allegiance, to, the, whole, package, best, summed, our, flag, love, it, or, leave, particular, objects, become, sacral, symbols, through, a, process, of, consecration, which, effectively, creates, the, sacred, by, setting, it, apart, from, the, profane, boy, scouts, and, the, armed, forces, in, any, country, teach, the, official, ways, of, folding, saluting, and, raising, the, flag, thus, emphasizing, that, the, flag, should, never, be, treated, as, just, a, piece, of, cloth, the, performance, of, ritual, creates, a, theatrical, like, frame, around, the, activities, symbols, and, events, that, shape, participant, s, experience, and, cognitive, ordering, of, the, world, simplifying, the, chaos, of, life, and, imposing, a, more, or, less, coherent, system, of, categories, of, meaning, onto, it, as, barbara, myerhoff, put, it, not, only, is, seeing, believing, doing, is, believing, for, simplicity, s, sake, the, range, of, diverse, rituals, can, be, divided, into, categories, with, common, characteristics, generally, falling, into, one, three, major, categories, however, rituals, can, fall, in, more, than, one, category, or, genre, and, may, be, grouped, in, a, variety, of, other, ways, for, example, the, anthropologist, victor, turner, writes, rituals, may, be, seasonal, or, they, may, be, contingent, held, in, response, to, an, individual, or, collective, crisis, other, classes, of, rituals, include, divinatory, rituals, ceremonies, performed, by, political, authorities, to, ensure, the, health, and, fertility, of, human, beings, animals, and, crops, in, their, territories, initiation, into, priesthoods, devoted, to, certain, deities, into, religious, associations, or, into, secret, societies, and, those, accompanying, the, daily, offering, of, food, and, libations, to, deities, or, ancestral, spirits, or, both, a, rite, of, passage, is, a, ritual, event, that, marks, a, person, s, transition, from, one, status, to, another, including, adoption, baptism, coming, of, age, graduation, inauguration, engagement, and, marriage, rites, of, passage, may, also, include, initiation, into, groups, not, tied, to, a, formal, stage, of, life, such, as, a, fraternity, arnold, van, gennep, stated, that, rites, of, passage, are, marked, by, three, stages, anthropologist, victor, turner, defines, rites, of, affliction, actions, that, seek, to, mitigate, spirits, or, supernatural, forces, that, inflict, humans, with, bad, luck, illness, gynecological, troubles, physical, injuries, and, other, such, misfortunes, these, rites, may, include, forms, of, spirit, divination, consulting, oracles, to, establish, causes, and, rituals, that, heal, purify, exorcise, and, protect, the, misfortune, experienced, may, include, individual, health, but, also, broader, climate, related, issues, such, as, drought, or, plagues, of, insects, healing, rites, performed, by, shamans, frequently, identify, social, disorder, as, the, cause, and, make, the, restoration, of, social, relationships, the, cure, turner, uses, the, example, of, the, isoma, ritual, among, the, ndembu, of, northwestern, zambia, to, illustrate, the, isoma, rite, of, affliction, is, used, to, cure, a, childless, woman, of, infertility, infertility, is, the, result, of, a, structural, tension, between, matrilineal, descent, and, virilocal, marriage, i, e, the, tension, a, woman, feels, between, her, mother, s, family, to, whom, she, owes, allegiance, and, her, husband, s, family, among, whom, she, must, live, it, is, because, the, woman, has, come, too, closely, in, touch, with, the, man, s, side, in, her, marriage, that, her, dead, matrikin, have, impaired, her, fertility, to, correct, the, balance, of, matrilinial, descent, and, marriage, the, isoma, ritual, dramatically, placates, the, deceased, spirits, by, requiring, the, woman, to, reside, with, her, mother, s, kin, shamanic, and, other, ritual, may, effect, a, psychotherapeutic, cure, leading, anthropologists, such, as, jane, atkinson, to, theorize, how, atkinson, argues, that, the, effectiveness, of, a, shamanic, ritual, for, an, individual, may, depend, upon, a, wider, audiences, acknowledging, the, shaman, s, power, which, may, lead, to, the, shaman, placing, greater, emphasis, on, engaging, the, audience, than, in, the, healing, of, the, patient, many, cultures, have, rites, associated, with, death, and, mourning, such, as, the, last, rites, and, wake, in, christianity, shemira, in, judaism, the, antyesti, in, hinduism, and, the, antam, sanskar, in, sikhism, these, rituals, often, reflect, deep, spiritual, beliefs, and, provide, a, structured, way, for, communities, to, grieve, and, honor, the, deceased, in, buddhism, for, example, the, bardo, rituals, guide, the, soul, through, the, stages, of, death, and, rebirth, in, islam, the, janazah, prayer, is, an, essential, communal, act, that, underscores, the, unity, of, the, muslim, community, in, life, and, death, indigenous, cultures, may, have, unique, practices, such, as, the, australian, aboriginal, smoking, ceremony, intended, to, cleanse, the, spirit, of, the, departed, and, ensure, a, safe, journey, to, the, afterlife, calendrical, and, commemorative, rites, are, ritual, events, marking, particular, times, of, year, or, a, fixed, period, since, an, important, event, calendrical, rituals, give, social, meaning, to, the, passage, of, time, creating, repetitive, weekly, monthly, or, yearly, cycles, some, rites, are, oriented, towards, a, culturally, defined, moment, of, change, in, the, climatic, cycle, such, as, solar, terms, or, the, changing, of, seasons, or, they, may, mark, the, inauguration, of, an, activity, such, as, planting, harvesting, or, moving, from, winter, to, summer, pasture, during, the, agricultural, cycle, they, may, be, fixed, by, the, solar, or, lunar, calendar, those, fixed, by, the, solar, calendar, fall, on, the, same, day, of, the, gregorian, solar, calendar, each, year, such, as, new, year, s, day, on, the, first, of, january, while, those, calculated, by, the, lunar, calendar, fall, on, different, dates, of, the, gregorian, solar, calendar, each, year, such, as, chinese, lunar, new, year, calendrical, rites, impose, a, cultural, order, on, nature, mircea, eliade, states, that, the, calendrical, rituals, of, many, religious, traditions, recall, and, commemorate, the, basic, beliefs, of, a, community, and, their, yearly, celebration, establishes, a, link, between, past, and, present, as, if, the, original, events, are, happening, over, again, thus, the, gods, did, thus, men, do, this, genre, of, ritual, encompasses, forms, of, sacrifice, and, offering, meant, to, praise, please, or, placate, divine, powers, according, to, early, anthropologist, edward, tylor, such, sacrifices, are, gifts, given, in, hope, of, a, return, catherine, bell, however, points, out, that, sacrifice, covers, a, range, of, practices, from, those, that, are, manipulative, and, magical, to, those, of, pure, devotion, hindu, puja, for, example, appear, to, have, no, other, purpose, than, to, please, the, deity, according, to, marcel, mauss, sacrifice, is, distinguished, from, other, forms, of, offering, by, being, consecrated, and, hence, sanctified, as, a, consequence, the, offering, is, usually, destroyed, in, the, ritual, to, transfer, it, to, the, deities, rites, of, feasting, and, fasting, are, those, through, which, a, community, publicly, expresses, an, adherence, to, basic, shared, religious, values, rather, than, to, the, overt, presence, of, deities, as, is, found, in, rites, of, affliction, where, feasting, or, fasting, may, also, take, place, it, encompasses, a, range, of, performances, such, as, communal, fasting, during, ramadan, by, muslims, the, slaughter, of, pigs, in, new, guinea, carnival, festivities, or, penitential, processions, in, catholicism, victor, turner, described, this, cultural, performance, of, basic, values, a, social, drama, such, dramas, allow, the, social, stresses, that, are, inherent, in, a, particular, culture, to, be, expressed, and, worked, out, symbolically, in, a, ritual, catharsis, as, the, social, tensions, continue, to, persist, outside, the, ritual, pressure, mounts, for, the, ritual, s, cyclical, performance, in, carnival, for, example, the, practice, of, masking, allows, people, to, be, what, they, are, not, and, acts, as, a, general, social, leveller, erasing, otherwise, tense, social, hierarchies, in, a, festival, that, emphasizes, play, outside, the, bounds, of, normal, social, limits, yet, outside, carnival, social, tensions, of, race, class, and, gender, persist, hence, requiring, the, repeated, periodic, release, found, in, the, festival, a, water, rite, is, a, rite, or, ceremonial, custom, that, uses, water, as, its, central, feature, typically, a, person, is, immersed, or, bathed, as, a, symbol, of, religious, indoctrination, or, ritual, purification, examples, include, the, mikveh, in, judaism, a, custom, of, purification, misogi, in, shinto, a, custom, of, spiritual, and, bodily, purification, involving, bathing, in, a, sacred, waterfall, river, or, lake, the, muslim, ritual, ablution, or, wudu, before, prayer, baptism, in, christianity, a, custom, and, sacrament, that, represents, both, purification, and, initiation, into, the, religious, community, the, christian, church, and, amrit, sanskar, in, sikhism, a, rite, of, passage, sanskar, that, similarly, represents, purification, and, initiation, into, the, religious, community, the, khalsa, rites, that, use, water, are, not, considered, water, rites, if, it, is, not, their, central, feature, for, example, having, water, to, drink, during, or, after, ritual, is, common, but, does, not, make, thar, ritual, a, water, ritual, unless, the, drinking, of, water, is, a, central, activity, such, as, in, the, church, of, all, worlds, waterkin, rite, according, to, anthropologist, clifford, geertz, political, rituals, actually, construct, power, that, is, in, his, analysis, of, the, balinese, state, he, argued, that, rituals, are, not, an, ornament, of, political, power, but, that, the, power, of, political, actors, depends, upon, their, ability, to, create, rituals, and, the, cosmic, framework, within, which, the, social, hierarchy, headed, by, the, king, is, perceived, as, natural, and, sacred, as, a, dramaturgy, of, power, comprehensive, ritual, systems, may, create, a, cosmological, order, that, sets, a, ruler, apart, as, a, divine, being, as, in, the, divine, right, of, european, kings, or, the, divine, japanese, emperor, political, rituals, also, emerge, in, the, form, of, uncodified, or, codified, conventions, practiced, by, political, officials, that, cement, respect, for, the, arrangements, of, an, institution, or, role, against, the, individual, temporarily, assuming, it, as, can, be, seen, in, the, many, rituals, still, observed, within, the, procedure, of, parliamentary, bodies, ritual, can, be, used, as, a, form, of, resistance, as, for, example, in, the, various, cargo, cults, that, developed, against, colonial, powers, in, the, south, pacific, in, such, religio, political, movements, islanders, would, use, ritual, imitations, of, western, practices, such, as, the, building, of, landing, strips, as, a, means, of, summoning, cargo, manufactured, goods, from, the, ancestors, leaders, of, these, groups, characterized, the, present, state, often, imposed, by, colonial, capitalist, regimes, as, a, dismantling, of, the, old, social, order, which, they, sought, to, restore, rituals, may, also, attain, political, significance, after, conflict, as, is, the, case, with, the, bosnian, syncretic, holidays, and, festivals, that, transgress, religious, boundaries, nineteenth, century, armchair, anthropologists, were, concerned, with, the, basic, question, of, how, religion, originated, in, human, history, in, the, twentieth, century, their, conjectural, histories, were, replaced, with, new, concerns, around, the, question, of, what, these, beliefs, and, practices, did, for, societies, regardless, of, their, origin, in, this, view, religion, was, a, universal, and, while, its, content, might, vary, enormously, it, served, certain, basic, functions, such, as, the, provision, of, prescribed, solutions, to, basic, human, psychological, and, social, problems, as, well, as, expressing, the, central, values, of, a, society, bronislaw, malinowski, used, the, concept, of, function, to, address, questions, of, individual, psychological, needs, a, r, radcliffe, brown, in, contrast, looked, for, the, function, purpose, of, the, institution, or, custom, in, preserving, or, maintaining, society, as, a, whole, they, thus, disagreed, about, the, relationship, of, anxiety, to, ritual, malinowski, argued, that, ritual, was, a, non, technical, means, of, addressing, anxiety, about, activities, where, dangerous, elements, were, beyond, technical, control, magic, is, to, be, expected, and, generally, to, be, found, whenever, man, comes, to, an, unbridgeable, gap, a, hiatus, in, his, knowledge, or, in, his, powers, of, practical, control, and, yet, has, to, continue, in, his, pursuit, radcliffe, brown, in, contrast, saw, ritual, as, an, expression, of, common, interest, symbolically, representing, a, community, and, that, anxiety, was, felt, only, if, the, ritual, was, not, performed, george, c, homans, sought, to, resolve, these, opposing, theories, by, differentiating, between, primary, anxieties, felt, by, people, who, lack, the, techniques, to, secure, results, and, secondary, or, displaced, anxiety, felt, by, those, who, have, not, performed, the, rites, meant, to, allay, primary, anxiety, correctly, homans, argued, that, purification, rituals, may, then, be, conducted, to, dispel, secondary, anxiety, a, r, radcliffe, brown, argued, that, ritual, should, be, distinguished, from, technical, action, viewing, it, as, a, structured, event, ritual, acts, differ, from, technical, acts, in, having, in, all, instances, some, expressive, or, symbolic, element, in, them, edmund, leach, in, contrast, saw, ritual, and, technical, action, less, as, separate, structural, types, of, activity, and, more, as, a, spectrum, actions, fall, into, place, on, a, continuous, scale, at, one, extreme, we, have, actions, which, are, entirely, profane, entirely, functional, technique, pure, and, simple, at, the, other, we, have, actions, which, are, entirely, sacred, strictly, aesthetic, technically, non, functional, between, these, two, extremes, we, have, the, great, majority, of, social, actions, which, partake, partly, of, the, one, sphere, and, partly, of, the, other, from, this, point, of, view, technique, and, ritual, profane, and, sacred, do, not, denote, types, of, action, but, aspects, of, almost, any, kind, of, action, the, functionalist, model, viewed, ritual, as, a, homeostatic, mechanism, to, regulate, and, stabilize, social, institutions, by, adjusting, social, interactions, maintaining, a, group, ethos, and, restoring, harmony, after, disputes, although, the, functionalist, model, was, soon, superseded, later, neofunctional, theorists, adopted, its, approach, by, examining, the, ways, that, ritual, regulated, larger, ecological, systems, roy, rappaport, for, example, examined, the, way, gift, exchanges, of, pigs, between, tribal, groups, in, papua, new, guinea, maintained, environmental, balance, between, humans, available, food, with, pigs, sharing, the, same, foodstuffs, as, humans, and, resource, base, rappaport, concluded, that, ritual, helps, to, maintain, an, undegraded, environment, limits, fighting, to, frequencies, which, do, not, endanger, the, existence, of, regional, population, adjusts, man, land, ratios, facilitates, trade, distributes, local, surpluses, of, pig, throughout, the, regional, population, in, the, form, of, pork, and, assures, people, of, high, quality, protein, when, they, are, most, in, need, of, it, similarly, j, stephen, lansing, traced, how, the, intricate, calendar, of, hindu, balinese, rituals, served, to, regulate, the, vast, irrigation, systems, of, bali, ensuring, the, optimum, distribution, of, water, over, the, system, while, limiting, disputes, while, most, functionalists, sought, to, link, ritual, to, the, maintenance, of, social, order, south, african, functionalist, anthropologist, max, gluckman, coined, the, phrase, rituals, of, rebellion, to, describe, a, type, of, ritual, in, which, the, accepted, social, order, was, symbolically, turned, on, its, head, gluckman, argued, that, the, ritual, was, an, expression, of, underlying, social, tensions, an, idea, taken, up, by, victor, turner, and, that, it, functioned, as, an, institutional, pressure, valve, relieving, those, tensions, through, these, cyclical, performances, the, rites, ultimately, functioned, to, reinforce, social, order, insofar, as, they, allowed, those, tensions, to, be, expressed, without, leading, to, actual, rebellion, carnival, is, viewed, in, the, same, light, he, observed, for, example, how, the, first, fruits, festival, incwala, of, the, south, african, bantu, kingdom, of, swaziland, symbolically, inverted, the, normal, social, order, so, that, the, king, was, publicly, insulted, women, asserted, their, domination, over, men, and, the, established, authority, of, elders, over, the, young, was, turned, upside, down, claude, l, vi, strauss, the, french, anthropologist, regarded, all, social, and, cultural, organization, as, symbolic, systems, of, communication, shaped, by, the, inherent, structure, of, the, human, brain, he, therefore, argued, that, the, symbol, systems, are, not, reflections, of, social, structure, as, the, functionalists, believed, but, are, imposed, on, social, relations, to, organize, them, l, vi, strauss, thus, viewed, myth, and, ritual, as, complementary, symbol, systems, one, verbal, one, non, verbal, l, vi, strauss, was, not, concerned, to, develop, a, theory, of, ritual, although, he, did, produce, a, four, volume, analysis, of, myth, but, was, influential, to, later, scholars, of, ritual, such, as, mary, douglas, and, edmund, leach, victor, turner, combined, arnold, van, gennep, s, model, of, the, structure, of, initiation, rites, and, gluckman, s, functionalist, emphasis, on, the, ritualization, of, social, conflict, to, maintain, social, equilibrium, with, a, more, structural, model, of, symbols, in, ritual, running, counter, to, this, emphasis, on, structured, symbolic, oppositions, within, a, ritual, was, his, exploration, of, the, liminal, phase, of, rites, of, passage, a, phase, in, which, anti, structure, appears, in, this, phase, opposed, states, such, as, birth, and, death, may, be, encompassed, by, a, single, act, object, or, phrase, the, dynamic, nature, of, symbols, experienced, in, ritual, provides, a, compelling, personal, experience, ritual, is, a, mechanism, that, periodically, converts, the, obligatory, into, the, desirable, mary, douglas, a, british, functionalist, extended, turner, s, theory, of, ritual, structure, and, anti, structure, with, her, own, contrasting, set, of, terms, grid, and, group, in, the, book, natural, symbols, drawing, on, levi, strauss, structuralist, approach, she, saw, ritual, as, symbolic, communication, that, constrained, social, behaviour, grid, is, a, scale, referring, to, the, degree, to, which, a, symbolic, system, is, a, shared, frame, of, reference, group, refers, to, the, degree, people, are, tied, into, a, tightly, knit, community, when, graphed, on, two, intersecting, axes, four, quadrants, are, possible, strong, group, strong, grid, strong, group, weak, grid, weak, group, weak, grid, weak, group, strong, grid, douglas, argued, that, societies, with, strong, group, or, strong, grid, were, marked, by, more, ritual, activity, than, those, weak, in, either, group, or, grid, see, also, section, below, in, his, analysis, of, rites, of, passage, victor, turner, argued, that, the, liminal, phase, that, period, betwixt, and, between, was, marked, by, two, models, of, human, interrelatedness, juxtaposed, and, alternating, structure, and, anti, structure, or, communitas, while, the, ritual, clearly, articulated, the, cultural, ideals, of, a, society, through, ritual, symbolism, the, unrestrained, festivities, of, the, liminal, period, served, to, break, down, social, barriers, and, to, join, the, group, into, an, undifferentiated, unity, with, no, status, property, insignia, secular, clothing, rank, kinship, position, nothing, to, demarcate, themselves, from, their, fellows, these, periods, of, symbolic, inversion, have, been, studied, in, a, diverse, range, of, rituals, such, as, pilgrimages, and, yom, kippur, beginning, with, max, gluckman, s, concept, of, rituals, of, rebellion, victor, turner, argued, that, many, types, of, ritual, also, served, as, social, dramas, through, which, structural, social, tensions, could, be, expressed, and, temporarily, resolved, drawing, on, van, gennep, s, model, of, initiation, rites, turner, viewed, these, social, dramas, as, a, dynamic, process, through, which, the, community, renewed, itself, through, the, ritual, creation, of, communitas, during, the, liminal, phase, turner, analyzed, the, ritual, events, in, 4, stages, breach, in, relations, crisis, redressive, actions, and, acts, of, reintegration, like, gluckman, he, argued, these, rituals, maintain, social, order, while, facilitating, disordered, inversions, thereby, moving, people, to, a, new, status, just, as, in, an, initiation, rite, arguments, melodies, formulas, maps, and, pictures, are, not, idealities, to, be, stared, at, but, texts, to, be, read, so, are, rituals, palaces, technologies, and, social, formations, clifford, geertz, also, expanded, on, the, symbolic, approach, to, ritual, that, began, with, victor, turner, geertz, argued, that, religious, symbol, systems, provided, both, a, model, of, reality, showing, how, to, interpret, the, world, as, is, as, well, as, a, model, for, reality, clarifying, its, ideal, state, the, role, of, ritual, according, to, geertz, is, to, bring, these, two, aspects, the, model, of, and, the, model, for, together, it, is, in, ritual, that, is, consecrated, behaviour, that, this, conviction, that, religious, conceptions, are, veridical, and, that, religious, directives, are, sound, is, somehow, generated, symbolic, anthropologists, like, geertz, analyzed, rituals, as, language, like, codes, to, be, interpreted, independently, as, cultural, systems, geertz, rejected, functionalist, arguments, that, ritual, describes, social, order, arguing, instead, that, ritual, actively, shapes, that, social, order, and, imposes, meaning, on, disordered, experience, he, also, differed, from, gluckman, and, turner, s, emphasis, on, ritual, action, as, a, means, of, resolving, social, passion, arguing, instead, that, it, simply, displayed, them, whereas, victor, turner, saw, in, ritual, the, potential, to, release, people, from, the, binding, structures, of, their, lives, into, a, liberating, anti, structure, or, communitas, maurice, bloch, argued, that, ritual, produced, conformity, maurice, bloch, argued, that, ritual, communication, is, unusual, in, that, it, uses, a, special, restricted, vocabulary, a, small, number, of, permissible, illustrations, and, a, restrictive, grammar, as, a, result, ritual, utterances, become, very, predictable, and, the, speaker, is, made, anonymous, in, that, they, have, little, choice, in, what, to, say, the, restrictive, syntax, reduces, the, ability, of, the, speaker, to, make, propositional, arguments, and, they, are, left, instead, with, utterances, that, cannot, be, contradicted, such, as, i, do, thee, wed, in, a, wedding, these, kinds, of, utterances, known, as, performatives, prevent, speakers, from, making, political, arguments, through, logical, argument, and, are, typical, of, what, weber, called, traditional, authority, instead, bloch, s, model, of, ritual, language, denies, the, possibility, of, creativity, thomas, csordas, in, contrast, analyzes, how, ritual, language, can, be, used, to, innovate, csordas, looks, at, groups, of, rituals, that, share, performative, elements, genres, of, ritual, with, a, shared, poetics, these, rituals, may, fall, along, the, spectrum, of, formality, with, some, less, others, more, formal, and, restrictive, csordas, argues, that, innovations, may, be, introduced, in, less, formalized, rituals, as, these, innovations, become, more, accepted, and, standardized, they, are, slowly, adopted, in, more, formal, rituals, in, this, way, even, the, most, formal, of, rituals, are, potential, avenues, for, creative, expression, in, his, historical, analysis, of, articles, on, ritual, and, rite, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, talal, asad, notes, that, from, 1771, to, 1852, the, brief, articles, on, ritual, define, it, as, a, book, directing, the, order, and, manner, to, be, observed, in, performing, divine, service, i, e, as, a, script, there, are, no, articles, on, the, subject, thereafter, until, 1910, when, a, new, lengthy, article, appeared, that, redefines, ritual, as, a, type, of, routine, behaviour, that, symbolizes, or, expresses, something, as, a, symbolic, activity, it, is, no, longer, confined, to, religion, but, is, distinguished, from, technical, action, the, shift, in, definitions, from, script, to, behavior, which, is, likened, to, a, text, is, matched, by, a, semantic, distinction, between, ritual, as, an, outward, sign, i, e, public, symbol, and, inward, meaning, the, emphasis, has, changed, to, establishing, the, meaning, of, public, symbols, and, abandoning, concerns, with, inner, emotional, states, since, as, evans, pritchard, wrote, such, emotional, states, if, present, at, all, must, vary, not, only, from, individual, to, individual, but, also, in, the, same, individual, on, different, occasions, and, even, at, different, points, in, the, same, rite, asad, in, contrast, emphasizes, behavior, and, inner, emotional, states, rituals, are, to, be, performed, and, mastering, these, performances, is, a, skill, requiring, disciplined, action, in, other, words, apt, performance, involves, not, symbols, to, be, interpreted, but, abilities, to, be, acquired, according, to, rules, that, are, sanctioned, by, those, in, authority, it, presupposes, no, obscure, meanings, but, rather, the, formation, of, physical, and, linguistic, skills, drawing, on, the, example, of, medieval, monastic, life, in, europe, he, points, out, that, ritual, in, this, case, refers, to, its, original, meaning, of, the, book, directing, the, order, and, manner, to, be, observed, in, performing, divine, service, this, book, prescribed, practices, whether, they, had, to, do, with, the, proper, ways, of, eating, sleeping, working, and, praying, or, with, proper, moral, dispositions, and, spiritual, aptitudes, aimed, at, developing, virtues, that, are, put, to, the, service, of, god, monks, in, other, words, were, disciplined, in, the, foucauldian, sense, the, point, of, monastic, discipline, was, to, learn, skills, and, appropriate, emotions, asad, contrasts, his, approach, by, concluding, symbols, call, for, interpretation, and, even, as, interpretive, criteria, are, extended, so, interpretations, can, be, multiplied, disciplinary, practices, on, the, other, hand, cannot, be, varied, so, easily, because, learning, to, develop, moral, capabilities, is, not, the, same, thing, as, learning, to, invent, representations, ethnographic, observation, shows, ritual, can, create, social, solidarity, douglas, foley, went, to, north, town, texas, between, 1973, and, 1974, to, study, public, high, school, culture, he, used, interviews, participant, observation, and, unstructured, chatting, to, study, racial, tension, and, capitalist, culture, in, his, ethnography, learning, capitalist, culture, foley, refers, to, football, games, and, friday, night, lights, as, a, community, ritual, this, ritual, united, the, school, and, created, a, sense, of, solidarity, and, community, on, a, weekly, basis, involving, pep, rallies, and, the, game, itself, foley, observed, judgement, and, segregation, based, on, class, social, status, wealth, and, gender, he, described, friday, night, lights, as, a, ritual, that, overcomes, those, differences, the, other, gentler, more, social, side, of, football, was, of, course, the, emphasis, on, camaraderie, loyalty, friendship, between, players, and, pulling, together, in, his, ethnography, waiting, for, elijah, time, and, encounter, in, a, bosnian, landscape, anthropologist, safet, had, imuhamedovi, suggests, that, shared, festivals, like, st, george, s, day, and, st, elijah, s, day, structure, interfaith, relationships, and, appear, as, acts, of, solidarity, against, ethno, nationalist, purifications, of, territory, in, bosnia, asad, s, work, critiqued, the, notion, that, there, were, universal, characteristics, of, ritual, to, be, found, in, all, cases, catherine, bell, has, extended, this, idea, by, shifting, attention, from, ritual, as, a, category, to, the, processes, of, ritualization, by, which, ritual, is, created, as, a, cultural, form, in, a, society, ritualization, is, a, way, of, acting, that, is, designed, and, orchestrated, to, distinguish, and, privilege, what, is, being, done, in, comparison, to, other, usually, more, quotidian, activities, anthropologists, have, also, analyzed, ritual, via, insights, from, other, behavioral, sciences, the, idea, that, cultural, rituals, share, behavioral, similarities, with, personal, rituals, of, individuals, was, discussed, early, on, by, freud, dulaney, and, fiske, compared, ethnographic, descriptions, of, both, rituals, and, non, ritual, doings, such, as, work, to, behavioral, descriptions, from, clinical, descriptions, of, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, they, note, that, ocd, behavior, often, consists, of, such, behavior, as, constantly, cleaning, objects, concern, or, disgust, with, bodily, waste, or, secretions, repetitive, actions, to, prevent, harm, heavy, emphasis, on, number, or, order, of, actions, etc, they, then, show, that, ethnographic, descriptions, of, cultural, rituals, contain, around, 5, times, more, of, such, content, than, ethnographic, descriptions, of, other, activities, such, as, work, fiske, later, repeated, similar, analysis, with, more, descriptions, from, a, larger, collection, of, different, cultures, also, contrasting, descriptions, of, cultural, rituals, to, descriptions, of, other, behavioral, disorders, in, addition, to, ocd, in, order, to, show, that, only, ocd, like, behavior, not, other, illnesses, shares, properties, with, rituals, the, authors, offer, tentative, explanations, for, these, findings, for, example, that, these, behavioral, traits, are, widely, needed, for, survival, to, control, risk, and, cultural, rituals, are, often, performed, in, the, context, of, perceived, collective, risk, other, anthropologists, have, taken, these, insights, further, and, constructed, more, elaborate, theories, based, on, the, brain, functions, and, physiology, li, nard, and, boyer, suggest, that, commonalities, between, obsessive, behavior, in, individuals, and, similar, behavior, in, collective, contexts, possibly, share, similarities, due, to, underlying, mental, processes, they, call, hazard, precaution, they, suggest, that, individuals, of, societies, seem, to, pay, more, attention, to, information, relevant, to, avoiding, hazards, which, in, turn, can, explain, why, collective, rituals, displaying, actions, of, hazard, precaution, are, so, popular, and, prevail, for, long, periods, in, cultural, transmission, according, to, the, sociologist, mervin, verbit, ritual, may, be, understood, as, one, of, the, key, components, of, religiosity, and, ritual, itself, may, be, broken, down, into, four, dimensions, content, frequency, intensity, and, centrality, the, content, of, a, ritual, may, vary, from, ritual, to, ritual, as, does, the, frequency, of, its, practice, the, intensity, of, the, ritual, how, much, of, an, impact, it, has, on, the, practitioner, and, the, centrality, of, the, ritual, in, that, religious, tradition, in, this, sense, ritual, is, similar, to, charles, glock, s, practice, dimension, of, religiosity, in, religion, a, ritual, can, comprise, the, prescribed, outward, forms, of, performing, the, cultus, or, cult, of, a, particular, observation, within, a, religion, or, religious, denomination, although, ritual, is, often, used, in, context, with, worship, performed, in, a, church, the, actual, relationship, between, any, religion, s, doctrine, and, its, ritual, s, can, vary, considerably, from, organized, religion, to, non, institutionalized, spirituality, such, as, ayahuasca, shamanism, as, practiced, by, the, urarina, of, the, upper, amazon, rituals, often, have, a, close, connection, with, reverence, thus, a, ritual, in, many, cases, expresses, reverence, for, a, deity, or, idealized, state, of, humanity, in, christianity, a, rite, is, used, to, refer, to, a, sacred, ceremony, such, as, anointing, of, the, sick, which, may, or, may, not, carry, the, status, of, a, sacrament, depending, on, the, christian, denomination, in, roman, catholicism, anointing, of, the, sick, is, a, sacrament, while, in, lutheranism, it, is, not, the, word, rite, is, also, used, to, denote, a, liturgical, tradition, usually, emanating, from, a, specific, center, examples, include, the, roman, rite, the, byzantine, rite, and, the, sarum, rite, such, rites, may, include, various, sub, rites, for, example, the, byzantine, rite, which, is, used, by, the, eastern, orthodox, eastern, lutheran, and, eastern, catholic, churches, has, greek, russian, and, other, ethnically, based, variants, for, daily, prayers, practicing, muslims, must, perform, a, ritual, recitation, from, the, quran, in, arabic, while, bowing, and, prostrating, quranic, chapter, 2, prescribes, rituals, such, as, the, direction, to, face, for, prayers, qiblah, pilgrimage, hajj, and,

rituals, are, progressively, taught, to, entrusted, members, during, initiation, into, a, particular, masonic, rite, comprising, a, series, of, degrees, conferred, by, a, masonic, body, the, degrees,
