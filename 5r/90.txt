reductionism, is, any, of, several, related, philosophical, ideas, regarding, the, associations, between, phenomena, which, can, be, described, in, terms, of, simpler, or, more, fundamental, phenomena, it, is, also, described, as, an, intellectual, and, philosophical, position, that, interprets, a, complex, system, as, the, sum, of, its, parts, the, oxford, companion, to, philosophy, suggests, that, reductionism, is, one, of, the, most, used, and, abused, terms, in, the, philosophical, lexicon, and, suggests, a, three, part, division, reductionism, can, be, applied, to, any, phenomenon, including, objects, problems, explanations, theories, and, meanings, for, the, sciences, application, of, methodological, reductionism, attempts, explanation, of, entire, systems, in, terms, of, their, individual, constituent, parts, and, their, interactions, for, example, the, temperature, of, a, gas, is, reduced, to, nothing, beyond, the, average, kinetic, energy, of, its, molecules, in, motion, thomas, nagel, and, others, speak, of, psychophysical, reductionism, the, attempted, reduction, of, psychological, phenomena, to, physics, and, chemistry, and, physico, chemical, reductionism, the, attempted, reduction, of, biology, to, physics, and, chemistry, in, a, very, simplified, and, sometimes, contested, form, reductionism, is, said, to, imply, that, a, system, is, nothing, but, the, sum, of, its, parts, however, a, more, nuanced, opinion, is, that, a, system, is, composed, entirely, of, its, parts, but, the, system, will, have, features, that, none, of, the, parts, have, which, in, essence, is, the, basis, of, emergentism, the, point, of, mechanistic, explanations, is, usually, showing, how, the, higher, level, features, arise, from, the, parts, other, definitions, are, used, by, other, authors, for, example, what, john, polkinghorne, terms, conceptual, or, epistemological, reductionism, is, the, definition, provided, by, simon, blackburn, and, by, jaegwon, kim, that, form, of, reductionism, which, concerns, a, program, of, replacing, the, facts, or, entities, involved, in, one, type, of, discourse, with, other, facts, or, entities, from, another, type, thereby, providing, a, relationship, between, them, richard, jones, distinguishes, ontological, and, epistemological, reductionism, arguing, that, many, ontological, and, epistemological, reductionists, affirm, the, need, for, different, concepts, for, different, degrees, of, complexity, while, affirming, a, reduction, of, theories, the, idea, of, reductionism, can, be, expressed, by, levels, of, explanation, with, higher, levels, reducible, if, need, be, to, lower, levels, this, use, of, levels, of, understanding, in, part, expresses, our, human, limitations, in, remembering, detail, however, most, philosophers, would, insist, that, our, role, in, conceptualizing, reality, does, not, change, the, fact, that, different, levels, of, organization, in, reality, do, have, different, properties, reductionism, does, not, preclude, the, existence, of, what, might, be, termed, emergent, phenomena, but, it, does, imply, the, ability, to, understand, those, phenomena, completely, in, terms, of, the, processes, from, which, they, are, composed, this, reductionist, understanding, is, very, different, from, ontological, or, strong, emergentism, which, intends, that, what, emerges, in, emergence, is, more, than, the, sum, of, the, processes, from, which, it, emerges, respectively, either, in, the, ontological, sense, or, in, the, epistemological, sense, richard, jones, divides, ontological, reductionism, into, two, the, reductionism, of, substances, e, g, the, reduction, of, mind, to, matter, and, the, reduction, of, the, number, of, structures, operating, in, nature, e, g, the, reduction, of, one, physical, force, to, another, this, permits, scientists, and, philosophers, to, affirm, the, former, while, being, anti, reductionists, regarding, the, latter, nancey, murphy, has, claimed, that, there, are, two, species, of, ontological, reductionism, one, that, claims, that, wholes, are, nothing, more, than, their, parts, and, atomist, reductionism, claiming, that, wholes, are, not, really, real, she, admits, that, the, phrase, really, real, is, apparently, senseless, but, she, has, tried, to, explicate, the, supposed, difference, between, the, two, ontological, reductionism, denies, the, idea, of, ontological, emergence, and, claims, that, emergence, is, an, epistemological, phenomenon, that, only, exists, through, analysis, or, description, of, a, system, and, does, not, exist, fundamentally, in, some, scientific, disciplines, ontological, reductionism, takes, two, forms, token, identity, theory, and, type, identity, theory, in, this, case, token, refers, to, a, biological, process, token, ontological, reductionism, is, the, idea, that, every, item, that, exists, is, a, sum, item, for, perceivable, items, it, affirms, that, every, perceivable, item, is, a, sum, of, items, with, a, lesser, degree, of, complexity, token, ontological, reduction, of, biological, things, to, chemical, things, is, generally, accepted, type, ontological, reductionism, is, the, idea, that, every, type, of, item, is, a, sum, type, of, item, and, that, every, perceivable, type, of, item, is, a, sum, of, types, of, items, with, a, lesser, degree, of, complexity, type, ontological, reduction, of, biological, things, to, chemical, things, is, often, rejected, michael, ruse, has, criticized, ontological, reductionism, as, an, improper, argument, against, vitalism, in, a, biological, context, methodological, reductionism, means, attempting, to, explain, all, biological, phenomena, in, terms, of, their, underlying, biochemical, and, molecular, processes, anthropologists, edward, burnett, tylor, and, james, george, frazer, employed, some, religious, reductionist, arguments, theory, reduction, is, the, process, by, which, a, more, general, theory, absorbs, a, special, theory, it, can, be, further, divided, into, translation, derivation, and, explanation, for, example, both, kepler, s, laws, of, the, motion, of, the, planets, and, galileo, s, theories, of, motion, formulated, for, terrestrial, objects, are, reducible, to, newtonian, theories, of, mechanics, because, all, the, explanatory, power, of, the, former, are, contained, within, the, latter, furthermore, the, reduction, is, considered, beneficial, because, newtonian, mechanics, is, a, more, general, theory, that, is, it, explains, more, events, than, galileo, s, or, kepler, s, besides, scientific, theories, theory, reduction, more, generally, can, be, the, process, by, which, one, explanation, subsumes, another, in, mathematics, reductionism, can, be, interpreted, as, the, philosophy, that, all, mathematics, can, or, ought, to, be, based, on, a, common, foundation, which, for, modern, mathematics, is, usually, axiomatic, set, theory, ernst, zermelo, was, one, of, the, major, advocates, of, such, an, opinion, he, also, developed, much, of, axiomatic, set, theory, it, has, been, argued, that, the, generally, accepted, method, of, justifying, mathematical, axioms, by, their, usefulness, in, common, practice, can, potentially, weaken, zermelo, s, reductionist, claim, jouko, v, n, nen, has, argued, for, second, order, logic, as, a, foundation, for, mathematics, instead, of, set, theory, whereas, others, have, argued, for, category, theory, as, a, foundation, for, certain, aspects, of, mathematics, the, incompleteness, theorems, of, kurt, g, del, published, in, 1931, caused, doubt, about, the, attainability, of, an, axiomatic, foundation, for, all, of, mathematics, any, such, foundation, would, have, to, include, axioms, powerful, enough, to, describe, the, arithmetic, of, the, natural, numbers, a, subset, of, all, mathematics, yet, g, del, proved, that, for, any, consistent, recursively, enumerable, axiomatic, system, powerful, enough, to, describe, the, arithmetic, of, the, natural, numbers, there, are, model, theoretically, true, propositions, about, the, natural, numbers, that, cannot, be, proved, from, the, axioms, such, propositions, are, known, as, formally, undecidable, propositions, for, example, the, continuum, hypothesis, is, undecidable, in, the, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, as, shown, by, cohen, reductionist, thinking, and, methods, form, the, basis, for, many, of, the, well, developed, topics, of, modern, science, including, much, of, physics, chemistry, and, molecular, biology, classical, mechanics, in, particular, is, seen, as, a, reductionist, framework, for, instance, we, understand, the, solar, system, in, terms, of, its, components, the, sun, and, the, planets, and, their, interactions, statistical, mechanics, can, be, considered, as, a, reconciliation, of, macroscopic, thermodynamic, laws, with, the, reductionist, method, of, explaining, macroscopic, properties, in, terms, of, microscopic, components, although, it, has, been, argued, that, reduction, in, physics, never, goes, all, the, way, in, practice, the, role, of, reduction, in, computer, science, can, be, thought, as, a, precise, and, unambiguous, mathematical, formalization, of, the, philosophical, idea, of, theory, reductionism, in, a, general, sense, a, problem, or, set, is, said, to, be, reducible, to, another, problem, or, set, if, there, is, a, computable, feasible, method, to, translate, the, questions, of, the, former, into, the, latter, so, that, if, one, knows, how, to, computably, feasibly, solve, the, latter, problem, then, one, can, computably, feasibly, solve, the, former, thus, the, latter, can, only, be, at, least, as, hard, to, solve, as, the, former, reduction, in, theoretical, computer, science, is, pervasive, in, both, the, mathematical, abstract, foundations, of, computation, and, in, real, world, performance, or, capability, analysis, of, algorithms, more, specifically, reduction, is, a, foundational, and, central, concept, not, only, in, the, realm, of, mathematical, logic, and, abstract, computation, in, computability, or, recursive, theory, where, it, assumes, the, form, of, e, g, turing, reduction, but, also, in, the, realm, of, real, world, computation, in, time, or, space, complexity, analysis, of, algorithms, where, it, assumes, the, form, of, e, g, polynomial, time, reduction, philosophers, of, the, enlightenment, worked, to, insulate, human, free, will, from, reductionism, descartes, separated, the, material, world, of, mechanical, necessity, from, the, world, of, mental, free, will, german, philosophers, introduced, the, concept, of, the, noumenal, realm, that, is, not, governed, by, the, deterministic, laws, of, phenomenal, nature, where, every, event, is, completely, determined, by, chains, of, causality, the, most, influential, formulation, was, by, immanuel, kant, who, distinguished, between, the, causal, deterministic, framework, the, mind, imposes, on, the, world, the, phenomenal, realm, and, the, world, as, it, exists, for, itself, the, noumenal, realm, which, as, he, believed, included, free, will, to, insulate, theology, from, reductionism, 19th, century, post, enlightenment, german, theologians, especially, friedrich, schleiermacher, and, albrecht, ritschl, used, the, romantic, method, of, basing, religion, on, the, human, spirit, so, that, it, is, a, person, s, feeling, or, sensibility, about, spiritual, matters, that, comprises, religion, most, common, philosophical, understandings, of, causation, involve, reducing, it, to, some, collection, of, non, causal, facts, opponents, of, these, reductionist, views, have, given, arguments, that, the, non, causal, facts, in, question, are, insufficient, to, determine, the, causal, facts, alfred, north, whitehead, s, metaphysics, opposed, reductionism, he, refers, to, this, as, the, fallacy, of, the, misplaced, concreteness, his, scheme, was, to, frame, a, rational, general, understanding, of, phenomena, derived, from, our, reality, an, alternative, term, for, ontological, reductionism, is, fragmentalism, often, used, in, a, pejorative, sense, in, cognitive, psychology, george, kelly, developed, constructive, alternativism, as, a, form, of, personal, construct, psychology, and, an, alternative, to, what, he, considered, accumulative, fragmentalism, for, this, theory, knowledge, is, seen, as, the, construction, of, successful, mental, models, of, the, exterior, world, rather, than, the, accumulation, of, independent, nuggets, of, truth, others, argue, that, inappropriate, use, of, reductionism, limits, our, understanding, of, complex, systems, in, particular, ecologist, robert, ulanowicz, says, that, science, must, develop, techniques, to, study, ways, in, which, larger, scales, of, organization, influence, smaller, ones, and, also, ways, in, which, feedback, loops, create, structure, at, a, given, level, independently, of, details, at, a, lower, level, of, organization, he, advocates, and, uses, information, theory, as, a, framework, to, study, propensities, in, natural, systems, the, limits, of, the, application, of, reductionism, are, claimed, to, be, especially, evident, at, levels, of, organization, with, greater, complexity, including, living, cells, neural, networks, biology, ecosystems, society, and, other, systems, formed, from, assemblies, of, large, numbers, of, diverse, components, linked, by, multiple, feedback, loops
