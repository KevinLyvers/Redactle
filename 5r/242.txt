sufism, arabic, romanized, al, fiyya, or, arabic, romanized, al, ta, awwuf, is, a, mystic, body, of, religious, practice, found, within, islam, which, is, characterized, by, a, focus, on, islamic, purification, spirituality, ritualism, and, asceticism, practitioners, of, sufism, are, referred, to, as, sufis, from, f, y, and, historically, typically, belonged, to, orders, known, as, tariqa, pl, uruq, congregations, formed, around, a, grand, wali, who, would, be, the, last, in, a, chain, of, successive, teachers, linking, back, to, muhammad, with, the, goal, of, undergoing, tazkiya, self, purification, and, the, hope, of, reaching, the, spiritual, station, of, ihsan, the, ultimate, aim, of, sufis, is, to, seek, the, pleasure, of, god, by, endeavoring, to, return, to, their, original, state, of, purity, and, natural, disposition, known, as, fitra, sufism, emerged, early, on, in, islamic, history, partly, as, a, reaction, against, the, worldliness, of, the, early, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, and, mainly, under, the, tutelage, of, hasan, al, basri, although, sufis, were, opposed, to, dry, legalism, they, strictly, observed, islamic, law, and, belonged, to, various, schools, of, islamic, jurisprudence, and, theology, although, the, overwhelming, majority, of, sufis, both, pre, modern, and, modern, remain, adherents, of, sunni, islam, certain, strands, of, sufi, thought, transferred, over, to, the, ambits, of, shia, islam, during, the, late, medieval, period, this, particularly, happened, after, the, safavid, conversion, of, iran, under, the, concept, of, irfan, important, focuses, of, sufi, worship, include, dhikr, the, practice, of, remembrance, of, god, sufis, also, played, an, important, role, in, spreading, islam, through, their, missionary, and, educational, activities, despite, a, relative, decline, of, sufi, orders, in, the, modern, era, and, attacks, from, fundamentalist, islamic, movements, such, as, salafism, and, wahhabism, sufism, has, continued, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, islamic, world, it, has, also, influenced, various, forms, of, spirituality, in, the, west, and, generated, significant, academic, interest, the, arabic, word, tasawwuf, lit, sufism, generally, translated, as, sufism, is, commonly, defined, by, western, authors, as, islamic, mysticism, the, arabic, term, sufi, has, been, used, in, islamic, literature, with, a, wide, range, of, meanings, by, both, proponents, and, opponents, of, sufism, classical, sufi, texts, which, stressed, certain, teachings, and, practices, of, the, quran, and, the, sunnah, exemplary, teachings, and, practices, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, gave, definitions, of, tasawwuf, that, described, ethical, and, spiritual, goals, and, functioned, as, teaching, tools, for, their, attainment, many, other, terms, that, described, particular, spiritual, qualities, and, roles, were, used, instead, in, more, practical, contexts, some, modern, scholars, have, used, other, definitions, of, sufism, such, as, intensification, of, islamic, faith, and, practice, and, process, of, realizing, ethical, and, spiritual, ideals, the, term, sufism, was, originally, introduced, into, european, languages, in, the, 18th, century, by, orientalist, scholars, who, viewed, it, mainly, as, an, intellectual, doctrine, and, literary, tradition, at, variance, with, what, they, saw, as, sterile, monotheism, of, islam, it, was, often, mistaken, as, a, universal, mysticism, in, contrast, to, legalistic, orthodox, islam, in, recent, times, historian, nile, green, has, argued, against, such, distinctions, stating, in, the, medieval, period, sufism, and, islam, were, more, or, less, the, same, in, modern, scholarly, usage, the, term, serves, to, describe, a, wide, range, of, social, cultural, political, and, religious, phenomena, associated, with, sufis, sufism, has, been, variously, defined, as, islamic, mysticism, the, mystical, expression, of, islamic, faith, the, inward, dimension, of, islam, the, phenomenon, of, mysticism, within, islam, the, main, manifestation, and, the, most, important, and, central, crystallization, of, mystical, practice, in, islam, and, the, interiorization, and, intensification, of, islamic, faith, and, practice, the, original, meaning, of, f, seems, to, have, been, one, who, wears, wool, f, and, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, calls, other, etymological, hypotheses, untenable, woolen, clothes, were, traditionally, associated, with, ascetics, and, mystics, al, qushayri, and, ibn, khaldun, both, rejected, all, possibilities, other, than, f, on, linguistic, grounds, another, explanation, traces, the, lexical, root, of, the, word, to, af, which, in, arabic, means, purity, and, in, this, context, another, similar, idea, of, tasawwuf, as, considered, in, islam, is, tazkiyah, meaning, self, purification, which, is, also, widely, used, in, sufism, these, two, explanations, were, combined, by, the, sufi, al, rudhabari, d, 322, ah, who, said, the, sufi, is, the, one, who, wears, wool, on, top, of, purity, others, have, suggested, that, the, word, comes, from, the, term, ahl, al, uffa, the, people, of, the, suffah, or, the, bench, who, were, a, group, of, impoverished, companions, of, muhammad, who, held, regular, gatherings, of, dhikr, one, of, the, most, prominent, companion, among, them, was, abu, hurayra, these, men, and, women, who, sat, at, al, masjid, an, nabawi, are, considered, by, some, to, be, the, first, sufis, the, current, consensus, is, that, sufism, emerged, in, the, hejaz, present, day, saudi, arabia, and, that, it, has, existed, as, a, practice, of, muslims, from, the, earliest, days, of, islam, even, predating, some, sectarian, divides, sufi, orders, are, based, on, the, bayah, arabic, lit, pledge, that, was, given, to, muhammad, by, his, ahabah, by, pledging, allegiance, to, muhammad, the, sahabah, had, committed, themselves, to, the, service, of, god, verily, those, who, give, bay, h, pledge, to, you, o, muhammad, they, are, giving, bay, h, pledge, to, god, the, hand, of, god, is, over, their, hands, then, whosoever, breaks, his, pledge, breaks, it, only, to, his, own, harm, and, whosoever, fulfils, what, he, has, covenanted, with, god, he, will, bestow, on, him, a, great, reward, sufis, believe, that, by, giving, bay, ah, pledging, allegiance, to, a, legitimate, sufi, shaykh, one, is, pledging, allegiance, to, muhammad, therefore, a, spiritual, connection, between, the, seeker, and, muhammad, is, established, it, is, through, muhammad, that, sufis, aim, to, learn, about, understand, and, connect, with, god, ali, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, major, figures, amongst, the, sahaba, who, have, directly, pledged, allegiance, to, muhammad, and, sufis, maintain, that, through, ali, knowledge, about, muhammad, and, a, connection, with, muhammad, may, be, attained, such, a, concept, may, be, understood, by, the, hadith, which, sufis, regard, to, be, authentic, in, which, muhammad, said, i, am, the, city, of, knowledge, and, ali, is, its, gate, eminent, sufis, such, as, ali, hujwiri, refer, to, ali, as, having, a, very, high, ranking, in, tasawwuf, furthermore, junayd, of, baghdad, regarded, ali, as, sheikh, of, the, principals, and, practices, of, tasawwuf, historian, jonathan, a, c, brown, notes, that, during, the, lifetime, of, muhammad, some, companions, were, more, inclined, than, others, to, intensive, devotion, pious, abstemiousness, and, pondering, the, divine, mysteries, more, than, islam, required, such, as, abu, dharr, al, ghifari, hasan, al, basri, a, tabi, is, considered, a, founding, figure, in, the, science, of, purifying, the, heart, sufism, emerged, early, on, in, islamic, history, partly, as, a, reaction, against, the, worldliness, of, the, early, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, and, mainly, under, the, tutelage, of, hasan, al, basri, practitioners, of, sufism, hold, that, in, its, early, stages, of, development, sufism, effectively, referred, to, nothing, more, than, the, internalization, of, islam, according, to, one, perspective, it, is, directly, from, the, qur, an, constantly, recited, meditated, and, experienced, that, sufism, proceeded, in, its, origin, and, its, development, other, practitioners, have, held, that, sufism, is, the, strict, emulation, of, the, way, of, muhammad, through, which, the, heart, s, connection, to, the, divine, is, strengthened, later, developments, of, sufism, occurred, from, people, like, dawud, tai, and, bayazid, bastami, early, on, sufism, was, known, for, its, strict, adherence, to, the, sunnah, for, example, it, was, reported, bastami, refused, to, eat, a, watermelon, because, he, did, not, find, any, proof, that, muhammad, ever, ate, it, according, to, the, late, medieval, mystic, the, persian, poet, jami, abd, allah, ibn, muhammad, ibn, al, hanafiyyah, died, c, 716, was, the, first, person, to, be, called, a, sufi, the, term, also, had, a, strong, connection, with, kufa, with, three, of, the, earliest, scholars, to, be, called, by, the, term, being, abu, hashim, al, kufi, jabir, ibn, hayyan, and, abdak, al, sufi, later, individuals, included, hatim, al, attar, from, basra, and, al, junayd, al, baghdadi, others, such, as, al, harith, al, muhasibi, and, sari, al, saqati, were, not, known, as, sufis, during, their, lifetimes, but, later, came, to, be, identified, as, such, due, to, their, focus, on, tazkiah, purification, important, contributions, in, writing, are, attributed, to, uwais, al, qarani, hasan, of, basra, harith, al, muhasibi, abu, nasr, as, sarraj, and, said, ibn, al, musayyib, ruwaym, from, the, second, generation, of, sufis, in, baghdad, was, also, an, influential, early, figure, as, was, junayd, of, baghdad, a, number, of, early, practitioners, of, sufism, were, disciples, of, one, of, the, two, historically, sufis, have, often, belonged, to, orders, known, as, tariqa, pl, uruq, congregations, formed, around, a, grand, master, wali, who, will, trace, their, teaching, through, a, chain, of, successive, teachers, back, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, within, the, sufi, tradition, the, formation, of, the, orders, did, not, immediately, produce, lineages, of, master, and, disciple, there, are, few, examples, before, the, eleventh, century, of, complete, lineages, going, back, to, the, prophet, muhammad, yet, the, symbolic, importance, of, these, lineages, was, immense, they, provided, a, channel, to, divine, authority, through, master, disciple, chains, it, was, through, such, chains, of, masters, and, disciples, that, spiritual, power, and, blessings, were, transmitted, to, both, general, and, special, devotees, these, orders, meet, for, spiritual, sessions, majalis, in, meeting, places, known, as, zawiyas, khanqahs, or, tekke, they, strive, for, ihsan, perfection, of, worship, as, detailed, in, a, hadith, ihsan, is, to, worship, allah, as, if, you, see, him, if, you, can, t, see, him, surely, he, sees, you, sufis, regard, muhammad, as, al, ins, n, al, k, mil, the, complete, human, who, personifies, the, attributes, of, absolute, reality, and, view, him, as, their, ultimate, spiritual, guide, sufi, orders, trace, most, of, their, original, precepts, from, muhammad, through, ali, ibn, abi, talib, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, naqshbandi, order, who, trace, their, original, precepts, to, muhammad, through, abu, bakr, however, it, was, not, necessary, to, formally, belong, to, a, tariqa, in, the, medieval, period, sufism, was, almost, equal, to, islam, in, general, and, not, limited, to, specific, orders, p24, sufism, had, a, long, history, already, before, the, subsequent, institutionalization, of, sufi, teachings, into, devotional, orders, tariqa, pl, tar, q, t, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, term, tariqa, is, used, for, a, school, or, order, of, sufism, or, especially, for, the, mystical, teaching, and, spiritual, practices, of, such, an, order, with, the, aim, of, seeking, aq, qah, ultimate, truth, a, tariqa, has, a, murshid, guide, who, plays, the, role, of, leader, or, spiritual, director, the, members, or, followers, of, a, tariqa, are, known, as, mur, d, n, singular, mur, d, meaning, desirous, viz, desiring, the, knowledge, of, knowing, god, and, loving, god, over, the, years, sufi, orders, have, influenced, and, been, adopted, by, various, shi, i, movements, especially, isma, ilism, which, led, to, the, safaviyya, order, s, conversion, to, shia, islam, from, sunni, islam, and, the, spread, of, twelverism, throughout, iran, prominent, tariqa, include, the, ba, alawiyya, badawiyya, bektashi, burhaniyya, chishti, khalwati, kubrawiya, madariyya, mevlevi, muridiyya, naqshbandi, nimatullahi, qadiriyya, qalandariyya, rahmaniyya, rifa, i, safavid, senussi, shadhili, suhrawardiyya, tijaniyyah, uwaisi, and, zahabiya, orders, existing, in, both, sunni, and, shia, islam, sufism, is, not, a, distinct, sect, as, is, sometimes, erroneously, assumed, but, a, method, of, approaching, or, a, way, of, understanding, the, religion, which, strives, to, take, the, regular, practice, of, the, religion, to, the, supererogatory, level, through, simultaneously, fulfilling, religious, duties, and, finding, a, way, and, a, means, of, striking, a, root, through, the, narrow, gate, in, the, depth, of, the, soul, out, into, the, domain, of, the, pure, arid, unimprisonable, spirit, which, itself, opens, out, on, to, the, divinity, academic, studies, of, sufism, confirm, that, sufism, as, a, separate, tradition, from, islam, apart, from, so, called, pure, islam, is, frequently, a, product, of, western, orientalism, and, modern, islamic, fundamentalists, as, a, mystic, and, ascetic, aspect, of, islam, it, is, considered, as, the, part, of, islamic, teaching, that, deals, with, the, purification, of, the, inner, self, by, focusing, on, the, more, spiritual, aspects, of, religion, sufis, strive, to, obtain, direct, experience, of, god, by, making, use, of, intuitive, and, emotional, faculties, that, one, must, be, trained, to, use, tasawwuf, is, regarded, as, a, science, of, the, soul, that, has, always, been, an, integral, part, of, orthodox, islam, in, his, al, risala, al, safadiyya, ibn, taymiyyah, describes, the, sufis, as, those, who, belong, to, the, path, of, the, sunna, and, represent, it, in, their, teachings, and, writings, ibn, taymiyya, s, sufi, inclinations, and, his, reverence, for, sufis, like, abdul, qadir, gilani, can, also, be, seen, in, his, hundred, page, commentary, on, futuh, al, ghayb, covering, only, five, of, the, seventy, eight, sermons, of, the, book, but, showing, that, he, considered, tasawwuf, essential, within, the, life, of, the, islamic, community, in, his, commentary, ibn, taymiyya, stresses, that, the, primacy, of, the, sharia, forms, the, soundest, tradition, in, tasawwuf, and, to, argue, this, point, he, lists, over, a, dozen, early, masters, as, well, as, more, contemporary, shaykhs, like, his, fellow, hanbalis, al, ansari, al, harawi, and, abdul, qadir, and, the, latter, s, own, shaykh, hammad, al, dabbas, the, upright, he, cites, the, early, shaykhs, shuyukh, al, salaf, such, as, al, fu, ayl, ibn, iy, ibrahim, ibn, adham, ma, ruf, al, karkhi, sirri, saqti, junayd, of, baghdad, and, others, of, the, early, teachers, as, well, as, abdul, qadir, gilani, hammad, abu, al, bayan, and, others, of, the, later, masters, that, they, do, not, permit, the, followers, of, the, sufi, path, to, depart, from, the, divinely, legislated, command, and, prohibition, al, ghazali, narrates, in, al, munqidh, min, al, dalal, the, vicissitudes, of, life, family, affairs, and, financial, constraints, engulfed, my, life, and, deprived, me, of, the, congenial, solitude, the, heavy, odds, confronted, me, and, provided, me, with, few, moments, for, my, pursuits, this, state, of, affairs, lasted, for, ten, years, but, whenever, i, had, some, spare, and, congenial, moments, i, resorted, to, my, intrinsic, proclivity, during, these, turbulent, years, numerous, astonishing, and, indescribable, secrets, of, life, were, unveiled, to, me, i, was, convinced, that, the, group, of, aulia, holy, mystics, is, the, only, truthful, group, who, follow, the, right, path, display, best, conduct, and, surpass, all, sages, in, their, wisdom, and, insight, they, derive, all, their, overt, or, covert, behaviour, from, the, illumining, guidance, of, the, holy, prophet, the, only, guidance, worth, quest, and, pursuit, in, the, eleventh, century, sufism, which, had, previously, been, a, less, codified, trend, in, islamic, piety, began, to, be, ordered, and, crystallized, into, orders, which, have, continued, until, the, present, day, all, these, orders, were, founded, by, a, major, islamic, scholar, and, some, of, the, largest, and, most, widespread, included, the, suhrawardiyya, after, abu, al, najib, suhrawardi, qadiriyya, after, abdul, qadir, gilani, the, rifa, iyya, after, ahmed, al, rifa, i, the, chishtiyya, after, moinuddin, chishti, the, shadiliyya, after, abul, hasan, ash, shadhili, the, hamadaniyyah, after, sayyid, ali, hamadani, the, naqshbandiyya, after, baha, ud, din, naqshband, bukhari, contrary, to, popular, perception, in, the, west, however, neither, the, founders, of, these, orders, nor, their, followers, ever, considered, themselves, to, be, anything, other, than, orthodox, sunni, muslims, and, in, fact, all, of, these, orders, were, attached, to, one, of, the, four, orthodox, legal, schools, of, sunni, islam, thus, the, qadiriyya, order, was, hanbali, with, its, founder, abdul, qadir, gilani, being, a, renowned, jurist, the, chishtiyya, was, hanafi, the, shadiliyya, order, was, maliki, and, the, naqshbandiyya, order, was, hanafi, thus, it, is, precisely, because, it, is, historically, proven, that, many, of, the, most, eminent, defenders, of, islamic, orthodoxy, such, as, abdul, qadir, gilani, ghazali, and, the, sultan, al, ad, d, n, saladin, were, connected, with, sufism, that, the, popular, studies, of, writers, like, idries, shah, are, continuously, disregarded, by, scholars, as, conveying, the, fallacious, image, that, sufism, is, somehow, distinct, from, islam, nile, green, has, observed, that, in, the, middle, ages, sufism, more, or, less, was, islam, p24, historically, sufism, became, an, incredibly, important, part, of, islam, and, one, of, the, most, widespread, and, omnipresent, aspects, of, muslim, life, in, islamic, civilization, from, the, early, medieval, period, onwards, when, it, began, to, permeate, nearly, all, major, aspects, of, sunni, islamic, life, in, regions, stretching, from, india, and, iraq, to, the, balkans, and, senegal, the, rise, of, islamic, civilization, coincides, strongly, with, the, spread, of, sufi, philosophy, in, islam, the, spread, of, sufism, has, been, considered, a, definitive, factor, in, the, spread, of, islam, and, in, the, creation, of, integrally, islamic, cultures, especially, in, africa, and, asia, the, senussi, tribes, of, libya, and, the, sudan, are, one, of, the, strongest, adherents, of, sufism, sufi, poets, and, philosophers, such, as, khoja, akhmet, yassawi, rumi, and, attar, of, nishapur, c, 1145, c, 1221, greatly, enhanced, the, spread, of, islamic, culture, in, anatolia, central, asia, and, south, asia, sufism, also, played, a, role, in, creating, and, propagating, the, culture, of, the, ottoman, world, and, in, resisting, european, imperialism, in, north, africa, and, south, asia, between, the, 13th, and, 16th, centuries, sufism, produced, a, flourishing, intellectual, culture, throughout, the, islamic, world, a, renaissance, whose, physical, artifacts, survive, in, many, places, a, person, or, group, would, endow, a, waqf, to, maintain, a, lodge, known, variously, as, a, zawiya, khanqah, or, tekke, to, provide, a, gathering, place, for, sufi, adepts, as, well, as, lodging, for, itinerant, seekers, of, knowledge, the, same, system, of, endowments, could, also, pay, for, a, complex, of, buildings, such, as, that, surrounding, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, in, istanbul, including, a, lodge, for, sufi, seekers, a, hospice, with, kitchens, where, these, seekers, could, serve, the, poor, and, or, complete, a, period, of, initiation, a, library, and, other, structures, no, important, domain, in, the, civilization, of, islam, remained, unaffected, by, sufism, in, this, period, opposition, to, sufi, teachers, and, orders, from, more, literalist, and, legalist, strains, of, islam, existed, in, various, forms, throughout, islamic, history, it, took, on, a, particularly, violent, form, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, emergence, of, the, wahhabi, movement, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, sufi, rituals, and, doctrines, also, came, under, sustained, criticism, from, modernist, islamic, reformers, liberal, nationalists, and, some, decades, later, socialist, movements, in, the, muslim, world, sufi, orders, were, accused, of, fostering, popular, superstitions, resisting, modern, intellectual, attitudes, and, standing, in, the, way, of, progressive, reforms, ideological, attacks, on, sufism, were, reinforced, by, agrarian, and, educational, reforms, as, well, as, new, forms, of, taxation, which, were, instituted, by, westernizing, national, governments, undermining, the, economic, foundations, of, sufi, orders, the, extent, to, which, sufi, orders, declined, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, varied, from, country, to, country, but, by, the, middle, of, the, century, the, very, survival, of, the, orders, and, traditional, sufi, lifestyle, appeared, doubtful, to, many, observers, however, defying, these, predictions, sufism, and, sufi, orders, have, continued, to, play, a, major, role, in, the, muslim, world, also, expanding, into, muslim, minority, countries, its, ability, to, articulate, an, inclusive, islamic, identity, with, greater, emphasis, on, personal, and, small, group, piety, has, made, sufism, especially, well, suited, for, contexts, characterized, by, religious, pluralism, and, secularist, perspectives, in, the, modern, world, the, classical, interpretation, of, sunni, orthodoxy, which, sees, in, sufism, an, essential, dimension, of, islam, alongside, the, disciplines, of, jurisprudence, and, theology, is, represented, by, institutions, such, as, egypt, s, al, azhar, university, and, zaytuna, college, with, al, azhar, s, current, grand, imam, ahmed, el, tayeb, recently, defining, sunni, orthodoxy, as, being, a, follower, of, any, of, the, four, schools, of, thought, hanafi, shafi, i, maliki, or, hanbali, and, of, the, sufism, of, imam, junayd, of, baghdad, in, doctrines, manners, and, purification, current, sufi, orders, include, madariyya, order, alians, bektashi, order, mevlevi, order, ba, alawiyya, chishti, order, jerrahi, naqshbandi, mujaddidi, ni, matull, h, qadiriyya, qalandariyya, sarwari, qadiriyya, shadhiliyya, suhrawardiyya, saifiah, naqshbandiah, and, uwaisi, the, relationship, of, sufi, orders, to, modern, societies, is, usually, defined, by, their, relationship, to, governments, turkey, persia, and, the, indian, subcontinent, have, all, been, a, center, for, many, sufi, lineages, and, orders, the, bektashi, were, closely, affiliated, with, the, ottoman, janissaries, and, are, the, heart, of, turkey, s, large, and, mostly, liberal, alevi, population, they, have, spread, westwards, to, cyprus, greece, albania, bulgaria, north, macedonia, bosnia, and, herzegovina, kosovo, and, more, recently, to, the, united, states, via, albania, sufism, is, popular, in, such, african, countries, as, egypt, tunisia, algeria, sudan, morocco, and, senegal, where, it, is, seen, as, a, mystical, expression, of, islam, sufism, is, traditional, in, morocco, but, has, seen, a, growing, revival, with, the, renewal, of, sufism, under, contemporary, spiritual, teachers, such, as, hamza, al, qadiri, al, boutchichi, mbacke, suggests, that, one, reason, sufism, has, taken, hold, in, senegal, is, because, it, can, accommodate, local, beliefs, and, customs, which, tend, toward, the, mystical, the, life, of, the, algerian, sufi, master, abdelkader, el, djezairi, is, instructive, in, this, regard, notable, as, well, are, the, lives, of, amadou, bamba, and, el, hadj, umar, tall, in, west, africa, and, sheikh, mansur, and, imam, shamil, in, the, caucasus, in, the, twentieth, century, some, muslims, have, called, sufism, a, superstitious, religion, which, holds, back, islamic, achievement, in, the, fields, of, science, and, technology, a, number, of, westerners, have, embarked, with, varying, degrees, of, success, on, the, path, of, sufism, one, of, the, first, to, return, to, europe, as, an, official, representative, of, a, sufi, order, and, with, the, specific, purpose, to, spread, sufism, in, western, europe, was, the, swedish, born, wandering, sufi, ivan, agu, li, ren, gu, non, the, french, scholar, became, a, sufi, in, the, early, twentieth, century, and, was, known, as, sheikh, abdul, wahid, yahya, his, manifold, writings, defined, the, practice, of, sufism, as, the, essence, of, islam, but, also, pointed, to, the, universality, of, its, message, spiritualists, such, as, george, gurdjieff, may, or, may, not, conform, to, the, tenets, of, sufism, as, understood, by, orthodox, muslims, while, all, muslims, believe, that, they, are, on, the, pathway, to, allah, and, hope, to, become, close, to, god, in, paradise, after, death, and, after, the, last, judgment, sufis, also, believe, that, it, is, possible, to, draw, closer, to, god, and, to, more, fully, embrace, the, divine, presence, in, this, life, the, chief, aim, of, all, sufis, is, to, seek, the, pleasure, of, god, by, working, to, restore, within, themselves, the, primordial, state, of, fitra, to, sufis, the, outer, law, consists, of, rules, pertaining, to, worship, transactions, marriage, judicial, rulings, and, criminal, law, what, is, often, referred, to, broadly, as, qanun, the, inner, law, of, sufism, consists, of, rules, about, repentance, from, sin, the, purging, of, contemptible, qualities, and, evil, traits, of, character, and, adornment, with, virtues, and, good, character, to, the, sufi, it, is, the, transmission, of, divine, light, from, the, teacher, s, heart, to, the, heart, of, the, student, rather, than, worldly, knowledge, that, allows, the, adept, to, progress, they, further, believe, that, the, teacher, should, attempt, inerrantly, to, follow, the, divine, law, according, to, moojan, momen, one, of, the, most, important, doctrines, of, sufism, is, the, concept, of, al, insan, al, kamil, the, perfect, man, this, doctrine, states, that, there, will, always, exist, upon, the, earth, a, qutb, pole, or, axis, of, the, universe, a, man, who, is, the, perfect, channel, of, grace, from, god, to, man, and, in, a, state, of, wilayah, sanctity, being, under, the, protection, of, allah, the, concept, of, the, sufi, qutb, is, similar, to, that, of, the, shi, i, imam, however, this, belief, puts, sufism, in, direct, conflict, with, shia, islam, since, both, the, qutb, who, for, most, sufi, orders, is, the, head, of, the, order, and, the, imam, fulfill, the, role, of, the, purveyor, of, spiritual, guidance, and, of, allah, s, grace, to, mankind, the, vow, of, obedience, to, the, shaykh, or, qutb, which, is, taken, by, sufis, is, considered, incompatible, with, devotion, to, the, imam, as, a, further, example, the, prospective, adherent, of, the, mevlevi, order, would, have, been, ordered, to, serve, in, the, kitchens, of, a, hospice, for, the, poor, for, 1001, days, prior, to, being, accepted, for, spiritual, instruction, and, a, further, 1, 001, days, in, solitary, retreat, as, a, precondition, of, completing, that, instruction, some, teachers, especially, when, addressing, more, general, audiences, or, mixed, groups, of, muslims, and, non, muslims, make, extensive, use, of, parable, allegory, and, metaphor, although, approaches, to, teaching, vary, among, different, sufi, orders, sufism, as, a, whole, is, primarily, concerned, with, direct, personal, experience, and, as, such, has, sometimes, been, compared, to, other, non, islamic, forms, of, mysticism, e, g, as, in, the, books, of, seyyed, hossein, nasr, many, sufi, believe, that, to, reach, the, highest, levels, of, success, in, sufism, typically, requires, that, the, disciple, live, with, and, serve, the, teacher, for, a, long, period, of, time, an, example, is, the, folk, story, about, baha, ud, din, naqshband, bukhari, who, gave, his, name, to, the, naqshbandi, order, he, is, believed, to, have, served, his, first, teacher, sayyid, muhammad, baba, as, samasi, for, 20, years, until, as, samasi, died, he, is, said, to, then, have, served, several, other, teachers, for, lengthy, periods, of, time, he, is, said, to, have, helped, the, poorer, members, of, the, community, for, many, years, and, after, this, concluded, his, teacher, directed, him, to, care, for, animals, cleaning, their, wounds, and, assisting, them, his, aspiration, preceded, all, other, aspirations, his, existence, preceded, nothingness, and, his, name, preceded, the, pen, because, he, existed, before, all, peoples, there, is, not, in, the, horizons, beyond, the, horizons, or, below, the, horizons, anyone, more, elegant, more, noble, more, knowing, more, just, more, fearsome, or, more, compassionate, than, the, subject, of, this, tale, he, is, the, leader, of, created, beings, the, one, whose, name, is, glorious, ahmad, mansur, al, hallaj, devotion, to, muhammad, is, the, strongest, practice, within, sufism, sufis, have, historically, revered, muhammad, as, the, prime, personality, of, spiritual, greatness, the, sufi, poet, saadi, shirazi, stated, he, who, chooses, a, path, contrary, to, that, of, the, prophet, shall, never, reach, the, destination, o, saadi, do, not, think, that, one, can, treat, that, way, of, purity, except, in, the, wake, of, the, chosen, one, rumi, attributes, his, self, control, and, abstinence, from, worldly, desires, as, qualities, attained, by, him, through, the, guidance, of, muhammad, rumi, states, i, sewed, my, two, eyes, shut, from, this, world, and, the, next, this, i, learned, from, muhammad, ibn, arabi, regards, muhammad, as, the, greatest, man, and, states, muhammad, s, wisdom, is, uniqueness, fardiya, because, he, is, the, most, perfect, existent, creature, of, this, human, species, for, this, reason, the, command, began, with, him, and, was, sealed, with, him, he, was, a, prophet, while, adam, was, between, water, and, clay, and, his, elemental, structure, is, the, seal, of, the, prophets, attar, of, nishapur, claimed, that, he, praised, muhammad, in, such, a, manner, that, was, not, done, before, by, any, poet, in, his, book, the, ilahi, nama, fariduddin, attar, stated, muhammad, is, the, exemplar, to, both, worlds, the, guide, of, the, descendants, of, adam, he, is, the, sun, of, creation, the, moon, of, the, celestial, spheres, the, all, seeing, eye, the, seven, heavens, and, the, eight, gardens, of, paradise, were, created, for, him, he, is, both, the, eye, and, the, light, in, the, light, of, our, eyes, sufis, have, historically, stressed, the, importance, of, muhammad, s, perfection, and, his, ability, to, intercede, the, persona, of, muhammad, has, historically, been, and, remains, an, integral, and, critical, aspect, of, sufi, belief, and, practice, bayazid, bastami, is, recorded, to, have, been, so, devoted, to, the, sunnah, of, muhammad, that, he, refused, to, eat, a, watermelon, because, he, could, not, establish, that, muhammad, ever, ate, one, in, the, 13th, century, a, sufi, poet, from, egypt, al, busiri, wrote, the, al, kaw, kib, ad, durr, ya, f, mad, khayr, al, bar, ya, the, celestial, lights, in, praise, of, the, best, of, creation, commonly, referred, to, as, qa, dat, al, burda, poem, of, the, mantle, in, which, he, extensively, praised, muhammad, this, poem, is, still, widely, recited, and, sung, amongst, sufi, groups, and, lay, muslims, alike, all, over, the, world, according, to, ibn, arabi, islam, is, the, best, religion, because, of, muhammad, ibn, arabi, regards, that, the, first, entity, that, was, brought, into, existence, is, the, reality, or, essence, of, muhammad, al, aq, qa, al, muhammadiyya, ibn, arabi, regards, muhammad, as, the, supreme, human, being, and, master, of, all, creatures, muhammad, is, therefore, the, primary, role, model, for, human, beings, to, aspire, to, emulate, ibn, arabi, believes, that, god, s, attributes, and, names, are, manifested, in, this, world, and, that, the, most, complete, and, perfect, display, of, these, divine, attributes, and, names, are, seen, in, muhammad, ibn, arabi, believes, that, one, may, see, god, in, the, mirror, of, muhammad, meaning, that, the, divine, attributes, of, god, are, manifested, through, muhammad, ibn, arabi, maintains, that, muhammad, is, the, best, proof, of, god, and, by, knowing, muhammad, one, knows, god, ibn, arabi, also, maintains, that, muhammad, is, the, master, of, all, of, humanity, in, both, this, world, and, the, afterlife, in, this, view, islam, is, the, best, religion, because, muhammad, is, islam, sufis, believe, the, sharia, exoteric, canon, tariqa, order, and, haqiqa, truth, are, mutually, interdependent, sufism, leads, the, adept, called, salik, or, wayfarer, in, his, sul, k, or, road, through, different, stations, maq, m, t, until, he, reaches, his, goal, the, perfect, tawhid, the, existential, confession, that, god, is, one, ibn, arabi, says, when, we, see, someone, in, this, community, who, claims, to, be, able, to, guide, others, to, god, but, is, remiss, in, but, one, rule, of, the, sacred, law, even, if, he, manifests, miracles, that, stagger, the, mind, asserting, that, his, shortcoming, is, a, special, dispensation, for, him, we, do, not, even, turn, to, look, at, him, for, such, a, person, is, not, a, sheikh, nor, is, he, speaking, the, truth, for, no, one, is, entrusted, with, the, secrets, of, god, most, high, save, one, in, whom, the, ordinances, of, the, sacred, law, are, preserved, jami, karamat, al, awliya, it, is, related, moreover, that, malik, one, of, the, founders, of, the, four, schools, of, sunni, law, was, a, strong, proponent, of, combining, the, inward, science, ilm, al, b, tin, of, mystical, knowledge, with, the, outward, science, of, jurisprudence, for, example, the, famous, twelfth, century, maliki, jurist, and, judge, qadi, iyad, later, venerated, as, a, saint, throughout, the, iberian, peninsula, narrated, a, tradition, in, which, a, man, asked, malik, about, something, in, the, inward, science, to, which, malik, replied, truly, none, knows, the, inward, science, except, those, who, know, the, outward, science, when, he, knows, the, outward, science, and, puts, it, into, practice, god, shall, open, for, him, the, inward, science, and, that, will, not, take, place, except, by, the, opening, of, his, heart, and, its, enlightenment, in, other, similar, traditions, it, is, related, that, malik, said, he, who, practices, sufism, tasawwuf, without, learning, sacred, law, corrupts, his, faith, tazandaqa, while, he, who, learns, sacred, law, without, practicing, sufism, corrupts, himself, tafassaqa, only, he, who, combines, the, two, proves, true, tahaqqaqa, the, amman, message, a, detailed, statement, issued, by, 200, leading, islamic, scholars, in, 2005, in, amman, specifically, recognized, the, validity, of, sufism, as, a, part, of, islam, this, was, adopted, by, the, islamic, world, s, political, and, temporal, leaderships, at, the, organisation, of, the, islamic, conference, summit, at, mecca, in, december, 2005, and, by, six, other, international, islamic, scholarly, assemblies, including, the, international, islamic, fiqh, academy, of, jeddah, in, july, 2006, the, definition, of, sufism, can, vary, drastically, between, different, traditions, what, may, be, intended, is, simple, tazkiah, as, opposed, to, the, various, manifestations, of, sufism, around, the, islamic, world, the, literature, of, sufism, emphasizes, highly, subjective, matters, that, resist, outside, observation, such, as, the, subtle, states, of, the, heart, often, these, resist, direct, reference, or, description, with, the, consequence, that, the, authors, of, various, sufi, treatises, took, recourse, to, allegorical, language, for, instance, much, sufi, poetry, refers, to, intoxication, which, islam, expressly, forbids, this, usage, of, indirect, language, and, the, existence, of, interpretations, by, people, who, had, no, training, in, islam, or, sufism, led, to, doubts, being, cast, over, the, validity, of, sufism, as, a, part, of, islam, also, some, groups, emerged, that, considered, themselves, above, the, sharia, and, discussed, sufism, as, a, method, of, bypassing, the, rules, of, islam, in, order, to, attain, salvation, directly, this, was, disapproved, of, by, traditional, scholars, for, these, and, other, reasons, the, relationship, between, traditional, islamic, scholars, and, sufism, is, complex, and, a, range, of, scholarly, opinion, on, sufism, in, islam, has, been, the, norm, some, scholars, such, as, al, ghazali, helped, its, propagation, while, other, scholars, opposed, it, william, chittick, explains, the, position, of, sufism, and, sufis, this, way, in, short, muslim, scholars, who, focused, their, energies, on, understanding, the, normative, guidelines, for, the, body, came, to, be, known, as, jurists, and, those, who, held, that, the, most, important, task, was, to, train, the, mind, in, achieving, correct, understanding, came, to, be, divided, into, three, main, schools, of, thought, theology, philosophy, and, sufism, this, leaves, us, with, the, third, domain, of, human, existence, the, spirit, most, muslims, who, devoted, their, major, efforts, to, developing, the, spiritual, dimensions, of, the, human, person, came, to, be, known, as, sufis, persians, played, a, huge, role, in, developing, and, systematising, islamic, mysticism, one, of, the, first, to, formalise, the, science, was, junayd, of, baghdad, a, persian, from, baghdad, other, great, persian, sufi, poets, include, rudaki, rumi, attar, nizami, hafez, sanai, shamz, tabrizi, and, jami, famous, poems, that, still, resonate, across, the, muslim, world, include, the, masnavi, of, rumi, the, bustan, by, saadi, the, conference, of, the, birds, by, attar, and, the, div, n, of, hafez, the, term, neo, sufism, was, originally, coined, by, fazlur, rahman, and, used, by, other, scholars, to, describe, reformist, currents, among, 18th, century, sufi, orders, whose, goal, was, to, remove, some, of, the, more, ecstatic, and, pantheistic, elements, of, the, sufi, tradition, and, reassert, the, importance, of, islamic, law, as, the, basis, for, inner, spirituality, and, social, activism, in, recent, times, it, has, been, increasingly, used, by, scholars, like, mark, sedgwick, in, the, opposite, sense, to, describe, various, forms, of, sufi, influenced, spirituality, in, the, west, in, particular, the, deconfessionalized, spiritual, movements, which, emphasize, universal, elements, of, the, sufi, tradition, and, de, emphasize, its, islamic, context, the, devotional, practices, of, sufis, vary, widely, prerequisites, to, practice, include, rigorous, adherence, to, islamic, norms, ritual, prayer, in, its, five, prescribed, times, each, day, the, fast, of, ramadan, and, so, forth, additionally, the, seeker, ought, to, be, firmly, grounded, in, supererogatory, practices, known, from, the, life, of, muhammad, such, as, the, sunnah, prayers, this, is, in, accordance, with, the, words, attributed, to, god, of, the, following, a, famous, hadith, qudsi, my, servant, draws, near, to, me, through, nothing, i, love, more, than, that, which, i, have, made, obligatory, for, him, my, servant, never, ceases, drawing, near, to, me, through, supererogatory, works, until, i, love, him, then, when, i, love, him, i, am, his, hearing, through, which, he, hears, his, sight, through, which, he, sees, his, hand, through, which, he, grasps, and, his, foot, through, which, he, walks, it, is, also, necessary, for, the, seeker, to, have, a, correct, creed, aqidah, and, to, embrace, with, certainty, its, tenets, the, seeker, must, also, of, necessity, turn, away, from, sins, love, of, this, world, the, love, of, company, and, renown, obedience, to, satanic, impulse, and, the, promptings, of, the, lower, self, the, way, in, which, this, purification, of, the, heart, is, achieved, is, outlined, in, certain, books, but, must, be, prescribed, in, detail, by, a, sufi, master, the, seeker, must, also, be, trained, to, prevent, the, corruption, of, those, good, deeds, which, have, accrued, to, his, or, her, credit, by, overcoming, the, traps, of, ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and, long, hopes, meaning, the, hope, for, a, long, life, allowing, us, to, mend, our, ways, later, rather, than, immediately, here, and, now, sufi, practices, while, attractive, to, some, are, not, a, means, for, gaining, knowledge, the, traditional, scholars, of, sufism, hold, it, as, absolutely, axiomatic, that, knowledge, of, god, is, not, a, psychological, state, generated, through, breath, control, thus, practice, of, techniques, is, not, the, cause, but, instead, the, occasion, for, such, knowledge, to, be, obtained, if, at, all, given, proper, prerequisites, and, proper, guidance, by, a, master, of, the, way, furthermore, the, emphasis, on, practices, may, obscure, a, far, more, important, fact, the, seeker, is, in, a, sense, to, become, a, broken, person, stripped, of, all, habits, through, the, practice, of, in, the, words, of, imam, al, ghazali, solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and, hunger, dhikr, is, the, remembrance, of, allah, commanded, in, the, quran, for, all, muslims, through, a, specific, devotional, act, such, as, the, repetition, of, divine, names, supplications, and, aphorisms, from, hadith, literature, and, the, quran, more, generally, dhikr, takes, a, wide, range, and, various, layers, of, meaning, this, includes, dhikr, as, any, activity, in, which, the, muslim, maintains, awareness, of, allah, to, engage, in, dhikr, is, to, practice, consciousness, of, the, divine, presence, and, love, or, to, seek, a, state, of, godwariness, the, quran, refers, to, muhammad, as, the, very, embodiment, of, dhikr, of, allah, 65, 10, 11, some, types, of, dhikr, are, prescribed, for, all, muslims, and, do, not, require, sufi, initiation, or, the, prescription, of, a, sufi, master, because, they, are, deemed, to, be, good, for, every, seeker, under, every, circumstance, the, dhikr, may, slightly, vary, among, each, order, some, sufi, orders, engage, in, ritualized, dhikr, ceremonies, or, sema, sema, includes, various, forms, of, worship, such, as, recitation, singing, the, most, well, known, being, the, qawwali, music, of, the, indian, subcontinent, instrumental, music, dance, most, famously, the, sufi, whirling, of, the, mevlevi, order, incense, meditation, ecstasy, and, trance, some, sufi, orders, stress, and, place, extensive, reliance, upon, dhikr, this, practice, of, dhikr, is, called, dhikr, e, qulb, invocation, of, allah, within, the, heartbeats, the, basic, idea, in, this, practice, is, to, visualize, the, allah, as, having, been, written, on, the, disciple, s, heart, the, practice, of, muraqaba, can, be, likened, to, the, practices, of, meditation, attested, in, many, faith, communities, while, variation, exists, one, description, of, the, practice, within, a, naqshbandi, lineage, reads, as, follows, he, is, to, collect, all, of, his, bodily, senses, in, concentration, and, to, cut, himself, off, from, all, preoccupation, and, notions, that, inflict, themselves, upon, the, heart, and, thus, he, is, to, turn, his, full, consciousness, towards, god, most, high, while, saying, three, times, ilah, anta, maqs, d, wa, rid, ka, matl, b, my, god, you, are, my, goal, and, your, good, pleasure, is, what, i, seek, then, he, brings, to, his, heart, the, name, of, the, essence, all, h, and, as, it, courses, through, his, heart, he, remains, attentive, to, its, meaning, which, is, essence, without, likeness, the, seeker, remains, aware, that, he, is, present, watchful, encompassing, of, all, thereby, exemplifying, the, meaning, of, his, saying, may, god, bless, him, and, grant, him, peace, worship, god, as, though, you, see, him, for, if, you, do, not, see, him, he, sees, you, and, likewise, the, prophetic, tradition, the, most, favored, level, of, faith, is, to, know, that, god, is, witness, over, you, wherever, you, may, be, sufi, whirling, or, sufi, spinning, is, a, form, of, sama, or, physically, active, meditation, which, originated, among, some, sufis, and, practised, by, the, sufi, dervishes, of, the, mevlevi, order, it, is, a, customary, dance, performed, within, the, sema, through, which, dervishes, also, called, semazens, from, persian, aim, to, reach, the, source, of, all, perfection, or, kemal, this, is, sought, through, abandoning, one, s, nafs, egos, or, personal, desires, by, listening, to, the, music, focusing, on, god, and, spinning, one, s, body, in, repetitive, circles, which, has, been, seen, as, a, symbolic, imitation, of, planets, in, the, solar, system, orbiting, the, sun, as, explained, by, mevlevi, practitioners, in, the, symbolism, of, the, sema, ritual, the, semazen, s, camel, s, hair, hat, sikke, represents, the, tombstone, of, the, ego, his, wide, white, skirt, tennure, represents, the, ego, s, shroud, by, removing, his, black, cloak, h, rka, he, is, spiritually, reborn, to, the, truth, at, the, beginning, of, the, sema, by, holding, his, arms, crosswise, the, semazen, appears, to, represent, the, number, one, thus, testifying, to, god, s, unity, while, whirling, his, arms, are, open, his, right, arm, is, directed, to, the, sky, ready, to, receive, god, s, beneficence, his, left, hand, upon, which, his, eyes, are, fastened, is, turned, toward, the, earth, the, semazen, conveys, god, s, spiritual, gift, to, those, who, are, witnessing, the, sema, revolving, from, right, to, left, around, the, heart, the, semazen, embraces, all, humanity, with, love, the, human, being, has, been, created, with, love, in, order, to, love, mevl, na, jal, ludd, n, rumi, says, all, loves, are, a, bridge, to, divine, love, yet, those, who, have, not, had, a, taste, of, it, do, not, know, the, traditional, view, of, most, orthodox, sunni, sufi, orders, such, as, the, qadiriyya, and, the, chisti, as, well, as, sunni, muslim, scholars, in, general, is, that, dancing, with, intent, during, dhikr, or, whilst, listening, to, sema, is, prohibited, musical, instruments, except, the, daf, have, traditionally, been, considered, as, prohibited, by, the, four, orthodox, sunni, schools, and, the, more, orthodox, sufi, tariqas, also, continued, to, prohibit, their, use, throughout, history, most, sufi, saints, have, stressed, that, musical, instruments, are, forbidden, however, some, sufi, saints, permitted, and, encouraged, it, whilst, maintaining, that, musical, instruments, and, female, voices, should, not, be, introduced, although, these, are, common, practice, today, for, example, qawwali, was, originally, a, form, of, sufi, devotional, singing, popular, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, is, now, usually, performed, at, dargahs, sufi, saint, amir, khusrau, is, said, to, have, infused,

include, custodian, protector, helper, and, friend, in, the, vernacular, it, is, most, commonly, used, by, muslims, to, indicate, an, islamic, saint, otherwise, referred, to, by, the, more, literal, friend, of, god, in, the, traditional, islamic, understanding, of, saints, the, saint, is, portrayed, as, someone, marked, by, divine, favor, holiness, and, who, is, specifically, chosen, by, god, and, endowed, with, exceptional, gifts, such, as, the, ability, to, work, miracles, the, doctrine, of, saints, was, articulated, by, islamic, scholars, very, early, on, in, muslim, history, and, particular, verses, of, the, quran, and, certain, hadith, were, interpreted, by, early, muslim, thinkers, as, documentary, evidence, of, the, existence, of, saints, since, the, first, muslim, hagiographies, were, written, during, the, period, when, sufism, began, its, rapid, expansion, many, of, the, figures, who, later, came, to, be, regarded, as, the, major, saints, in, sunni, islam, were, the, early, sufi, mystics, like, hasan, of, basra, d, 728, farqad, sabakhi, d, 729, dawud, tai, d, 777, 81, rabi, a, al, adawiyya, d, 801, maruf, karkhi, d, 815, and, junayd, of, baghdad, d, 910, from, the, twelfth, to, the, fourteenth, century, the, general, veneration, of, saints, among, both, people, and, sovereigns, reached, its, definitive, form, with, the, organization, of, sufism,

treated, sufism, and, islam, as, distinct, subjects, leading, to, an, over, emphasis, on, the, translation, of, classical, sufi, mystical, literature, in, the, academic, study, of, sufism, at, the, expense, of, the, lived, practises, in, islam, as, well, as, a, separation, of, sufism, from, its, islamic, roots, in, the, development, of, sufism, as, a, religious, form, in, the, west, figures, like, rumi, have, become, well, known, in, the, united, states, where, sufism, is, perceived, as, a, peaceful, and, apolitical, form, of, islam, seyyed, hossein, nasr, states, that, the, preceding, theories, are, false, according, to, the, point, of, view, of, sufism, the, contemporary, amateur, historian, david, livingstone, writes, sufi, practices, are, merely, attempts, to, attain, psychic, states, for, their, own, sake, though, it, is, claimed, the, pursuit, represents, seeking, closeness, to, god, and, that, the, achieved, magical, powers, are, gifts, of, advanced, spirituality, for, several, reasons, sufism, was, generally, looked, upon, as, heretical, among, muslim, scholars, among, the, deviations, introduced, by, the, sufis, was, the, tendency, to, believe, the, daily, prayers, to, be, only, for, the, masses, who, had, not, achieved, deeper, spiritual, knowledge, but, could, be, disregarded, by, those, more, advanced, spiritually, the, sufis, introduced, the, practice, of, congregational, dhikr, or, religious, oral, exercises, consisting, of, a, continuous, repetition, of, the, name, of, god, these, practices, were, unknown, to, early, islam, and, consequently, regarded, as, bid, ah, meaning, unfounded, innovation, also, many, of, the, sufis, adopted, the, practice, of, total, tawakkul, or, complete, trust, or, dependence, on, god, by, avoiding, all, kinds, of, labor, or, commerce, refusing, medical, care, when, they, were, ill, and, living, by, begging, the, islamic, institute, in, mannheim, germany, which, works, towards, the, integration, of, europe, and, muslims, sees, sufism, as, particularly, suited, for, interreligious, dialogue, and, intercultural, harmonisation, in, democratic, and, pluralist, societies, it, has, described, sufism, as, a, symbol, of, tolerance, and, humanism, nondogmatic, flexible, and, non, violent, according, to, philip, jenkins, a, professor, at, baylor, university, the, sufis, are, much, more, than, tactical, allies, for, the, west, they, are, potentially, the, greatest, hope, for, pluralism, and, democracy, within, muslim, nations, likewise, several, governments, and, organisations, have, advocated, the, promotion, of, sufism, as, a, means, of, combating, intolerant, and, violent, strains, of, islam, for, example, the, chinese, and, russian, governments, openly, favor, sufism, as, the, best, means, of, protecting, against, islamist, subversion, the, british, government, especially, following, the, 7, july, 2005, london, bombings, has, favoured, sufi, groups, in, its, battle, against, muslim, extremist, currents, the, influential, rand, corporation, an, american, think, tank, issued, a, major, report, titled, building, moderate, muslim, networks, which, urged, the, us, government, to, form, links, with, and, bolster, muslim, groups, that, opposed, islamist, extremism, the, report, stressed, the, sufi, role, as, moderate, traditionalists, open, to, change, and, thus, as, allies, against, violence, news, organisations, such, as, the, bbc, economist, and, boston, globe, have, also, seen, sufism, as, a, means, to, deal, with, violent, muslim, extremists, idries, shah, states, that, sufism, is, universal, in, nature, its, roots, predating, the, rise, of, islam, and, christianity, he, quotes, suhrawardi, as, saying, that, this, sufism, was, a, form, of, wisdom, known, to, and, practiced, by, a, succession, of, sages, including, the, mysterious, ancient, hermes, of, egypt, and, that, ibn, al, farid, stresses, that, sufism, lies, behind, and, before, systematization, that, our, wine, existed, before, what, you, call, the, grape, and, the, vine, the, school, and, the, system, shah, s, views, have, however, been, rejected, by, modern, scholars, such, modern, trends, of, neo, sufis, in, western, countries, allow, non, muslims, to, receive, instructions, on, following, the, sufi, path, not, without, opposition, by, muslims, who, consider, such, instruction, outside, the, sphere, of, islam, numerous, comparisons, have, been, made, between, sufism, and, the, mystic, components, of, some, eastern, religions, the, tenth, century, persian, polymath, al, biruni, in, his, book, tahaqeeq, ma, lilhind, min, makulat, makulat, fi, aliaqbal, am, marzula, critical, study, of, indian, speech, rationally, acceptable, or, rejected, discusses, the, similarity, of, some, sufism, concepts, with, aspects, of, hinduism, such, as, atma, with, ruh, tanasukh, with, reincarnation, mokhsha, with, fanafillah, ittihad, with, nirvana, union, between, paramatma, in, jivatma, avatar, or, incarnation, with, hulul, vedanta, with, wahdatul, ujud, mujahadah, with, sadhana, other, scholars, have, likewise, compared, the, sufi, concept, of, wa, dat, al, wuj, d, to, advaita, vedanta, fanaa, to, samadhi, muraqaba, to, dhyana, and, tariqa, to, the, noble, eightfold, path, the, ninth, century, iranian, mystic, bayazid, bostami, is, alleged, to, have, imported, certain, concepts, from, hindusim, into, his, version, of, sufism, under, the, conceptual, umbrella, of, baqaa, meaning, perfection, ibn, al, arabi, and, mansur, al, hallaj, both, referred, to, muhammad, as, having, attained, perfection, and, titled, him, as, al, ins, n, al, k, mil, inayat, khan, believed, that, the, god, worshipped, by, sufis, is, not, specific, to, any, particular, religion, or, creed, but, is, the, same, god, worshipped, by, people, of, all, beliefs, this, god, is, not, limited, by, any, name, whether, it, be, allah, god, gott, dieu, khuda, brahma, or, bhagwan,
