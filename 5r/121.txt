religions, this, classification, dates, back, to, a, lecture, given, by, max, m, ller, in, 1873, and, is, based, on, whether, or, not, a, religion, seeks, to, gain, new, converts, the, three, main, religions, classified, as, missionary, religions, are, buddhism, christianity, and, islam, while, the, non, missionary, religions, include, judaism, zoroastrianism, and, hinduism, other, religions,

meaning, to, make, sure, the, person, they, are, proposing, to, teach, is, open, to, hearing, what, they, have, to, say, bah, pioneers, rather, than, attempting, to, supplant, the, cultural, underpinnings, of, the, people, in, their, adopted, communities, are, encouraged, to, integrate, into, the, society, and, apply, bah, principles, in, living, and, working, with, their, neighbors, bah, s, recognize, the, divine, origins, of, all, revealed, religion, and, believe, that, these, religions, occurred, sequentially, as, part, of, a, divine, plan, see, progressive, revelation, with, each, new, revelation, superseding, and, fulfilling, that, of, its, predecessors, bah, s, regard, their, own, faith, as, the, most, recent, but, not, the, last, and, believe, its, teachings, which, are, centered, around, the, principle, of, the, oneness, of, humanity, are, most, suited, to, meeting, the, needs, of, a, global, community, in, most, countries, conversion, is, a, simple, matter, of, filling, out, a, card, stating, a, declaration, of, belief, this, includes, acknowledgement, of, bah, u, llah, the, founder, of, the, faith, as, the, messenger, of, god, for, this, age, awareness, and, acceptance, of, his, teachings, and, intention, to, be, obedient, to, the, institutions, and, laws, he, established, conversion, to, the, bah, faith, carries, with, it, an, explicit, belief, in, the, common, foundation, of, all, revealed, religion, a, commitment, to, the, unity, of, mankind, and, active, service, to, the, community, at, large, especially, in, areas, that, will, foster, unity, and, concord, since, the, bah, faith, has, no, clergy, converts, are, encouraged, to, be, active, in, all, aspects, of, community, life, even, a, recent, convert, may, be, elected, to, serve, on, a, local, spiritual, assembly, the, guiding, bah, institution, at, the, community, level, within, christianity, conversion, refers, variously, to, three, different, phenomena, a, person, becoming, christian, who, was, previously, not, christian, a, christian, moving, from, one, christian, denomination, to, another, a, particular, spiritual, development, sometimes, called, the, second, conversion, or, the, conversion, of, the, baptised, conversion, to, christianity, is, the, religious, conversion, of, a, previously, non, christian, person, to, some, form, of, christianity, some, christian, sects, require, full, conversion, for, new, members, regardless, of, any, history, in, other, christian, sects, or, from, certain, other, sects, the, exact, requirements, vary, between, different, churches, and, denominations, baptism, is, traditionally, seen, as, a, sacrament, of, admission, to, christianity, christian, baptism, has, some, parallels, with, jewish, immersion, by, mikvah, in, the, new, testament, jesus, commanded, his, disciples, in, the, great, commission, to, go, and, make, disciples, of, all, nations, evangelization, sharing, the, gospel, message, or, good, news, in, deed, and, word, is, an, expectation, of, christians, this, table, summarizes, three, protestant, beliefs, much, of, the, theology, of, latter, day, saint, baptism, was, established, during, the, early, latter, day, saint, movement, founded, by, joseph, smith, jr, according, to, this, theology, baptism, must, be, by, immersion, for, the, remission, of, sins, meaning, that, through, baptism, past, sins, are, forgiven, and, occurs, after, one, has, shown, faith, and, repentance, mormon, baptism, does, not, purport, to, remit, any, sins, other, than, personal, ones, as, adherents, do, not, believe, in, original, sin, latter, day, saints, baptisms, also, occur, only, after, an, age, of, accountability, which, is, defined, as, the, age, of, eight, years, the, theology, thus, rejects, infant, baptism, in, addition, latter, day, saint, theology, requires, that, baptism, may, only, be, performed, with, one, who, has, been, called, and, ordained, by, god, with, priesthood, authority, because, the, churches, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, operate, under, a, lay, priesthood, children, raised, in, a, mormon, family, are, usually, baptized, by, a, father, or, close, male, friend, or, family, member, who, has, achieved, the, office, of, priest, which, is, conferred, upon, worthy, male, members, at, least, 16, years, old, in, the, lds, church, baptism, is, seen, as, symbolic, both, of, jesus, death, burial, and, resurrection, and, is, also, symbolic, of, the, baptized, individual, putting, off, of, the, natural, or, sinful, man, and, becoming, spiritually, reborn, as, a, disciple, of, jesus, membership, into, a, latter, day, saint, church, is, granted, only, by, baptism, whether, or, not, a, person, has, been, raised, in, the, church, latter, day, saint, churches, do, not, recognize, baptisms, of, other, faiths, as, valid, because, they, believe, baptisms, must, be, performed, under, the, church, s, unique, authority, thus, all, who, come, into, one, of, the, latter, day, saint, faiths, as, converts, are, baptized, even, if, they, have, previously, received, baptism, in, another, faith, when, performing, a, baptism, latter, day, saints, say, the, following, prayer, before, performing, the, ordinance, having, been, commissioned, of, jesus, christ, i, baptize, you, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, ghost, amen, baptisms, inside, and, outside, the, temples, are, usually, done, in, a, baptistry, although, they, can, be, performed, in, any, body, of, water, in, which, the, person, may, be, completely, immersed, the, person, administering, the, baptism, must, recite, the, prayer, exactly, and, immerse, every, part, limb, hair, and, clothing, of, the, person, being, baptized, if, there, are, any, mistakes, or, if, any, part, of, the, person, being, baptized, is, not, fully, immersed, the, baptism, must, be, redone, in, addition, to, the, baptizer, two, members, of, the, church, witness, the, baptism, to, ensure, that, it, is, performed, properly, following, baptism, latter, day, saints, receive, the, gift, of, the, holy, ghost, by, the, laying, on, of, hands, of, a, melchizedek, priesthood, holder, latter, day, saints, hold, that, one, may, be, baptized, after, death, through, the, vicarious, act, of, a, living, individual, and, holders, of, the, melchezidek, priesthood, practice, baptism, for, the, dead, as, a, missionary, ritual, this, doctrine, answers, the, question, of, the, righteous, non, believer, and, the, unevangelized, by, providing, a, post, mortem, means, of, repentance, and, salvation, converting, to, islam, requires, one, to, declare, the, shah, dah, the, muslim, profession, of, faith, there, is, no, god, but, god, muhammad, is, the, messenger, of, god, according, to, clinton, bennett, british, american, scholar, of, religious, studies, one, s, declaration, of, the, muslim, profession, of, faith, does, not, imply, faith, in, god, alone, since, the, conversion, to, islam, includes, other, distinct, islamic, beliefs, as, well, as, part, of, the, muslim, creed, aq, dah, technically, the, shahadah, first, pillar, is, the, only, obligatory, statement, of, faith, in, islam, however, over, time, a, list, of, six, items, evolved, the, essentials, of, faith, iman, mufassal, namely, belief, in, god, in, god, s, angels, scriptures, messengers, day, of, judgment, and, god, s, power, in, the, islamic, religion, it, is, believed, that, everyone, is, muslim, at, birth, due, to, this, those, who, convert, are, typically, referred, to, as, reverts, in, islam, the, practice, of, religious, circumcision, is, considered, a, sunnah, custom, not, a, requirement, for, conversion, and, furthermore, it, is, never, mentioned, in, the, quran, the, majority, of, clerical, opinions, holds, that, circumcision, is, not, required, upon, entering, the, muslim, faith, in, the, sunn, branch, of, islam, the, sh, fi, and, anbal, schools, regard, both, male, and, female, circumcision, as, legally, obligatory, for, muslims, while, the, m, lik, and, anaf, schools, regard, it, as, non, binding, and, only, recommended, for, both, sexes, conversion, to, judaism, is, the, religious, conversion, of, non, jews, to, become, members, of, the, jewish, religion, and, jewish, ethnoreligious, community, the, procedure, and, requirements, for, conversion, depend, on, the, sponsoring, denomination, a, conversion, in, accordance, with, the, process, of, a, denomination, is, not, a, guarantee, of, recognition, by, another, denomination, a, formal, conversion, is, also, sometimes, undertaken, by, individuals, whose, jewish, ancestry, is, questioned, even, if, they, were, raised, jewish, but, may, not, actually, be, considered, jews, according, to, traditional, jewish, law, as, late, as, the, 6th, century, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, caliph, umar, ibn, khattab, were, issuing, decrees, against, conversion, to, judaism, implying, that, this, was, still, occurring, in, some, cases, a, person, may, forgo, a, formal, conversion, to, judaism, and, adopt, some, or, all, beliefs, and, practices, of, judaism, however, without, a, formal, conversion, many, highly, observant, jews, will, reject, a, convert, s, jewish, status, there, are, no, rituals, or, dogmas, nor, any, sort, of, procedures, in, conversion, to, spiritism, the, doctrine, is, first, considered, as, science, then, philosophy, and, lastly, as, a, religion, allan, kardec, s, codification, of, spiritism, occurred, between, the, years, 1857, and, 1868, currently, there, are, 25, to, 60, million, people, studying, spiritism, in, various, countries, mainly, in, brazil, through, its, essential, books, which, include, the, spirits, book, the, book, on, mediums, the, gospel, according, to, spiritism, heaven, and, hell, and, the, genesis, according, to, spiritism, chico, xavier, wrote, over, 490, additional, books, which, expand, on, the, spiritualist, doctrine, as, explained, in, the, first, of, the, 1, 019, questions, and, answers, in, the, spirits, book, 1, what, is, god, answer, god, is, the, supreme, intelligence, first, cause, of, all, things, the, consensus, in, spiritism, is, that, god, the, great, creator, is, above, everything, including, all, human, things, such, as, rituals, dogmas, denominations, or, any, other, thing, persons, newly, adhering, to, buddhism, traditionally, taking, three, refuge, express, faith, in, the, three, jewels, buddha, dhamma, and, sangha, before, a, monk, nun, or, similar, representative, with, often, the, sangha, the, community, of, practitioners, also, in, ritual, attendance, throughout, the, timeline, of, buddhism, conversions, of, entire, countries, and, regions, to, buddhism, were, frequent, as, buddhism, spread, throughout, asia, for, example, in, the, 11th, century, in, burma, king, anoratha, converted, his, entire, country, to, theravada, buddhism, at, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, jayavarman, vii, set, the, stage, for, conversion, of, the, khmer, people, to, theravada, buddhism, mass, conversions, of, areas, and, communities, to, buddhism, occur, up, to, the, present, day, for, example, in, the, dalit, buddhist, movement, in, india, there, have, been, organized, mass, conversions, exceptions, to, encouraging, conversion, may, occur, in, some, buddhist, movements, in, tibetan, buddhism, for, example, the, current, dalai, lama, discourages, active, attempts, to, win, converts, hinduism, is, a, diverse, system, of, thought, with, beliefs, spanning, monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, pandeism, monism, and, atheism, among, others, hinduism, has, no, traditional, ecclesiastical, order, no, centralized, religious, authorities, no, universally, accepted, governing, body, no, binding, holy, book, nor, any, mandatory, prayer, attendance, requirements, in, its, diffuse, and, open, structure, numerous, schools, and, sects, of, hinduism, have, developed, and, spun, off, in, india, with, help, from, its, ascetic, scholars, since, the, vedic, age, the, six, astika, and, two, nastika, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, in, its, history, did, not, develop, a, missionary, or, proselytization, methodology, and, they, co, existed, with, each, other, most, hindu, sub, schools, and, sects, do, not, actively, seek, converts, individuals, have, had, a, choice, to, enter, leave, or, change, their, god, s, spiritual, convictions, accept, or, discard, any, rituals, and, practices, and, pursue, spiritual, knowledge, and, liberation, moksha, in, different, ways, however, various, schools, of, hinduism, do, have, some, core, common, beliefs, such, as, the, belief, that, all, living, beings, have, atman, soul, a, belief, in, karma, theory, spirituality, ahimsa, non, violence, as, the, greatest, dharma, or, virtue, and, others, religious, conversion, to, hinduism, has, a, long, history, outside, india, merchants, and, traders, of, india, particularly, from, indian, peninsula, carried, their, religious, ideas, which, led, to, religious, conversions, to, hinduism, in, indonesia, champa, cambodia, and, burma, some, sects, of, hindus, particularly, of, the, bhakti, schools, began, seeking, or, accepting, converts, in, early, to, mid, 20th, century, for, example, groups, like, the, international, society, for, krishna, consciousness, accept, those, who, have, a, desire, to, follow, their, sects, of, hinduism, and, have, their, own, religious, conversion, procedure, since, 1800, ce, religious, conversion, from, and, to, hinduism, has, been, a, controversial, subject, within, hinduism, some, have, suggested, that, the, concept, of, missionary, conversion, either, way, is, contrary, to, the, precepts, of, hinduism, religious, leaders, of, some, of, hinduism, sects, such, as, brahmo, samaj, have, seen, hinduism, as, a, non, missionary, religion, yet, welcomed, new, members, while, other, leaders, of, hinduism, s, diverse, schools, have, stated, that, with, the, arrival, of, missionary, islam, and, christianity, in, india, the, view, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, proselytism, in, hinduism, must, be, re, examined, in, recent, decades, mainstream, hinduism, schools, have, attempted, to, systematize, ways, to, accept, religious, converts, with, an, increase, in, inter, religious, mixed, marriages, the, steps, involved, in, becoming, a, hindu, have, variously, included, a, period, where, the, interested, person, gets, an, informal, ardha, hindu, name, and, studies, ancient, literature, on, spiritual, path, and, practices, english, translations, of, upanishads, agama, itihasa, ethics, in, sutra, hindu, festivals, yoga, if, after, a, period, of, study, the, individual, still, wants, to, convert, a, namakarana, samskara, ceremony, is, held, where, the, individual, adopts, a, traditional, hindu, name, the, initiation, ceremony, may, also, include, yajna, i, e, fire, ritual, with, sanskrit, hymns, under, guidance, of, a, local, hindu, priest, some, of, these, places, are, mathas, and, asramas, hermitage, monastery, where, one, or, more, gurus, spiritual, guide, conduct, the, conversion, and, offer, spiritual, discussions, some, schools, encourage, the, new, convert, to, learn, and, participate, in, community, activities, such, as, festivals, diwali, etc, read, and, discuss, ancient, literature, learn, and, engage, in, rites, of, passages, ceremonies, of, birth, first, feeding, first, learning, day, age, of, majority, wedding, cremation, and, others, jainism, accepts, anyone, who, wants, to, embrace, the, religion, there, is, no, specific, ritual, for, becoming, a, jain, one, does, not, need, to, ask, any, authorities, for, admission, one, becomes, a, jain, on, one, s, own, by, observing, the, five, vows, vratas, the, five, main, vows, as, mentioned, in, the, ancient, jain, texts, like, tattvarthasutra, are, following, the, five, vows, is, the, main, requirement, in, jainism, all, other, aspects, such, as, visiting, temples, are, secondary, jain, monks, and, nuns, are, required, to, observe, these, five, vows, strictly, sikhism, is, not, known, to, openly, proselytize, conversions, however, it, is, open, and, accepting, to, anyone, wanting, to, take, on, the, sikh, faith, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, rapid, growth, of, new, religious, movements, nrms, led, some, psychologists, and, other, scholars, to, propose, that, these, groups, were, using, brainwashing, or, mind, control, techniques, to, gain, converts, this, theory, was, publicized, by, the, popular, news, media, but, disputed, by, other, scholars, including, some, sociologists, of, religion, in, the, 1960s, sociologist, john, lofland, lived, with, unification, church, missionary, young, oon, kim, and, a, small, group, of, american, church, members, in, california, and, studied, their, activities, in, trying, to, promote, their, beliefs, and, win, converts, to, their, church, lofland, noted, that, most, of, their, efforts, were, ineffective, and, that, most, of, the, people, who, joined, did, so, because, of, personal, relationships, often, family, relationships, with, existing, members, lofland, summarised, his, findings, in, 1964, in, a, doctoral, thesis, entitled, the, world, savers, a, field, study, of, cult, processes, and, in, 1966, in, book, form, published, by, prentice, hall, as, doomsday, cult, a, study, of, conversion, proselytization, and, maintenance, of, faith, it, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, widely, cited, studies, of, the, process, of, religious, conversion, and, one, of, the, first, modern, sociological, studies, of, a, new, religious, movement, the, church, of, scientology, attempts, to, gain, converts, by, offering, free, stress, tests, it, has, also, used, the, celebrity, status, of, some, of, its, members, most, notably, that, of, the, american, actor, tom, cruise, to, attract, converts, the, church, of, scientology, requires, that, all, converts, sign, a, legal, waiver, which, covers, their, relationship, with, the, church, of, scientology, before, engaging, in, scientology, services, research, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, netherlands, has, shown, a, positive, correlation, between, areas, lacking, mainstream, churches, and, the, percentage, of, people, who, are, members, of, a, new, religious, movement, this, applies, also, for, the, presence, of, new, age, centres, on, the, other, end, of, the, proselytising, scale, are, religions, that, do, not, accept, any, converts, often, these, are, relatively, small, close, knit, minority, religions, that, are, ethnically, based, such, as, the, yazidis, druze, and, mandaeans, the, parsis, a, zoroastrianism, group, based, in, india, classically, does, not, accept, converts, but, this, issue, became, controversial, in, the, 20th, century, due, to, a, rapid, decline, in, membership, chinese, traditional, religion, lacks, clear, criteria, for, membership, and, hence, for, conversion, however, taoism, does, have, its, own, religious, conversion, ceremony, which, seems, to, be, adopted, and, modified, from, chinese, buddhist, refuge, taking, ceremonies, the, shakers, and, some, indian, eunuch, brotherhoods, do, not, allow, procreation, so, that, every, member, is, a, convert, different, factors, and, circumstances, may, operate, and, interact, to, persuade, individuals, of, groups, to, convert, and, adopt, a, new, set, of, religious, doctrines, and, habits, religious, enthusiasm, for, proselytism, can, play, a, role, for, example, the, new, testament, chronicles, the, personal, activities, of, the, apostles, and, their, followers, in, inspired, preaching, miracle, working, and, the, subsequent, gathering, of, followers, freshly, converted, irish, and, anglo, saxon, priests, spread, their, new, found, faith, among, pagan, british, and, germanic, peoples, missions, of, the, 19th, century, spread, against, a, background, of, north, atlantic, revivalism, with, its, emotionalism, and, mass, meeting, crowd, psychological, behaviours, messianism, may, prepare, groups, for, the, coming, of, a, messiah, or, of, a, saviour, thus, the, 1st, century, levant, steeped, in, expectations, of, overturning, the, political, situation, provided, fertile, ground, for, nascent, christianity, and, other, jewish, messianic, sects, such, as, the, zealots, some, religious, traditions, rather, than, stressing, emotion, in, the, conversion, process, emphasise, the, importance, of, philosophical, thought, as, a, pathway, to, adopting, a, new, religion, saint, paul, in, athens, fits, here, as, do, some, of, the, indic, religions, such, as, buddhism, insofar, as, it, ranks, as, a, religion, and, jainism, the, historical, god, fearers, may, represent, a, philosophical, bridge, between, hellenism, and, abrahamic, faith, a, religious, creed, which, can, capture, the, ear, and, support, of, secular, power, can, become, a, prestige, movement, encouraging, the, mass, of, a, people, to, follow, its,
