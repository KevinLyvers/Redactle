believed, to, have, created, or, for, controlling, some, part, of, the, universe, or, life, for, which, such, a, deity, is, often, worshipped, belief, in, the, existence, of, at, least, one, god, is, called, theism, conceptions, of, god, vary, considerably, many, notable, theologians, and, philosophers, have, developed, arguments, for, and, against, the, existence, of, god, atheism, rejects, the, belief, in, any, deity, agnosticism, is, the, belief, that, the, existence, of, god, is, unknown, or, unknowable, some, theists, view, knowledge, concerning, god, as, derived, from, faith, god, is, often, conceived, as, the, greatest, entity, in, existence, god, is, often, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, all, things, and, so, is, seen, as, the, creator, sustainer, and, ruler, of, the, universe, god, is, often, thought, of, as, incorporeal, and, independent, of, the, material, creation, while, pantheism, holds, that, god, is, the, universe, itself, god, is, sometimes, seen, as, omnibenevolent, while, deism, holds, that, god, is, not, involved, with, humanity, apart, from, creation, some, traditions, attach, spiritual, significance, to, maintaining, some, form, of, relationship, with, god, often, involving, acts, such, as, worship, and, prayer, and, see, god, as, the, source, of, all, moral, obligation, god, is, sometimes, described, without, reference, to, gender, while, others, use, terminology, that, is, gender, specific, god, is, referred, to, by, different, names, depending, on, the, language, and, cultural, tradition, sometimes, with, different, titles, of, god, used, in, reference, to, god, s, various, attributes, the, earliest, written, form, of, the, germanic, word, god, comes, from, the, 6th, century, christian, codex, argenteus, the, english, word, itself, is, derived, from, the, proto, germanic, u, an, the, reconstructed, proto, indo, european, form, hu, t, m, was, likely, based, on, the, root, hau, which, meant, either, to, call, or, to, invoke, the, germanic, words, for, god, were, originally, neuter, but, during, the, process, of, the, christianization, of, the, germanic, peoples, from, their, indigenous, germanic, paganism, the, words, became, a, masculine, syntactic, form, in, the, english, language, capitalization, is, used, when, the, word, is, used, as, a, proper, noun, as, well, as, for, other, names, by, which, a, god, is, known, consequently, the, capitalized, form, of, god, is, not, used, for, multiple, gods, or, when, used, to, refer, to, the, generic, idea, of, a, deity, the, english, word, god,

creator, of, the, universe, chukwu, in, igbo, and, hayyi, rabbi, in, mandaeism, the, existence, of, god, is, a, subject, of, debate, in, theology, philosophy, of, religion, and, popular, culture, in, philosophical, terms, the, question, of, the, existence, of, god, involves, the, disciplines, of, epistemology, the, nature, and, scope, of, knowledge, and, ontology, study, of, the, nature, of, being, or, existence, and, the, theory, of, value, since, some, definitions, of, god, include, perfection, ontological, arguments, refer, to, any, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, that, is, based, on, a, priori, reasoning, notable, ontological, arguments, were, formulated, by, anselm, and, ren, descartes, cosmological, arguments, such, as, those, described, below, use, concepts, around, the, origin, of, the, universe, to, argue, for, the, existence, of, god, the, teleological, argument, also, called, the, argument, from, design, uses, the, complexity, within, the, universe, as, a, proof, of, the, existence, of, god, it, is, countered, that, the, fine, tuning, required, for, a, stable, universe, with, life, on, earth, is, illusionary, as, humans, are, only, able, to, observe, the, small, part, of, this, universe, that, succeeded, in, making, such, observation, possible, called, the, anthropic, principle, and, so, would, not, learn, of, for, example, life, on, other, planets, or, of, universes, that, did, not, occur, because, of, different, laws, of, physics, non, theists, have, argued, that, complex, processes, that, have, natural, explanations, yet, to, be, discovered, are, referred, to, the, supernatural, called, god, of, the, gaps, other, theists, such, as, john, henry, newman, who, believed, theistic, evolution, was, acceptable, have, also, argued, against, versions, of, the, teleological, argument, and, held, that, it, is, limiting, of, god, to, view, him, having, to, only, intervene, specially, in, some, instances, rather, than, having, complex, processes, designed, to, create, order, the, argument, from, beauty, states, that, this, universe, happens, to, contain, special, beauty, in, it, and, that, there, would, be, no, particular, reason, for, this, over, aesthetic, neutrality, other, than, god, this, has, been, countered, by, pointing, to, the, existence, of, ugliness, in, the, universe, this, has, also, been, countered, by, arguing, that, beauty, has, no, objective, reality, and, so, the, universe, could, be, seen, as, ugly, or, that, humans, have, made, what, is, more, beautiful, than, nature, the, argument, from, morality, argues, for, the, existence, of, god, given, the, assumption, of, the, objective, existence, of, morals, while, prominent, non, theistic, philosophers, such, as, the, atheist, j, l, mackie, agreed, that, the, argument, is, valid, they, disagreed, with, its, premises, david, hume, argued, that, there, is, no, basis, to, believe, in, objective, moral, truths, while, biologist, e, o, wilson, theorized, that, the, feelings, of, morality, are, a, by, product, of, natural, selection, in, humans, and, would, not, exist, independent, of, the, mind, philosopher, michael, lou, martin, argued, that, a, subjective, account, for, morality, can, be, acceptable, similar, to, the, argument, from, morality, is, the, argument, from, conscience, which, argues, for, the, existence, of, god, given, the, existence, of, a, conscience, that, informs, of, right, and, wrong, even, against, prevailing, moral, codes, philosopher, john, locke, instead, argued, that, conscience, is, a, social, construct, and, thus, could, lead, to, contradicting, morals, atheism, is, in, a, broad, sense, the, rejection, of, belief, in, the, existence, of, deities, agnosticism, is, the, view, that, the, truth, values, of, certain, claims, especially, metaphysical, and, religious, claims, such, as, whether, god, the, divine, or, the, supernatural, exist, are, unknown, and, perhaps, unknowable, theism, generally, holds, that, god, exists, objectively, and, independently, of, human, thought, and, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, any, belief, in, god, or, gods, some, view, the, existence, of, god, as, an, empirical, question, richard, dawkins, states, that, a, universe, with, a, god, would, be, a, completely, different, kind, of, universe, from, one, without, and, it, would, be, a, scientific, difference, carl, sagan, argued, that, the, doctrine, of, a, creator, of, the, universe, was, difficult, to, prove, or, disprove, and, that, the, only, conceivable, scientific, discovery, that, could, disprove, the, existence, of, a, creator, not, necessarily, a, god, would, be, the, discovery, that, the, universe, is, infinitely, old, some, theologians, such, as, alister, mcgrath, argue, that, the, existence, of, god, is, not, a, question, that, can, be, answered, using, the, scientific, method, agnostic, stephen, jay, gould, argued, that, science, and, religion, are, not, in, conflict, and, proposed, an, approach, dividing, the, world, of, philosophy, into, what, he, called, non, overlapping, magisteria, noma, in, this, view, questions, of, the, supernatural, such, as, those, relating, to, the, existence, and, nature, of, god, are, non, empirical, and, are, the, proper, domain, of, theology, the, methods, of, science, should, then, be, used, to, answer, any, empirical, question, about, the, natural, world, and, theology, should, be, used, to, answer, questions, about, ultimate, meaning, and, moral, value, in, this, view, the, perceived, lack, of, any, empirical, footprint, from, the, magisterium, of, the, supernatural, onto, natural, events, makes, science, the, sole, player, in, the, natural, world, stephen, hawking, and, co, author, leonard, mlodinow, state, in, their, 2010, book, the, grand, design, that, it, is, reasonable, to, ask, who, or, what, created, the, universe, but, if, the, answer, is, god, then, the, question, has, merely, been, deflected, to, that, of, who, created, god, both, authors, claim, however, that, it, is, possible, to, answer, these, questions, purely, within, the, realm, of, science, and, without, invoking, divine, beings, a, deity, or, god, with, lowercase, g, refers, to, a, supernatural, being, monotheism, is, the, belief, that, there, is, only, one, deity, referred, to, as, god, with, uppercase, g, comparing, or, equating, other, entities, to, god, is, viewed, as, idolatry, in, monotheism, and, is, often, strongly, condemned, judaism, is, one, of, the, oldest, monotheistic, traditions, in, the, world, islam, s, most, fundamental, concept, is, tawhid, meaning, oneness, or, uniqueness, the, first, pillar, of, islam, is, an, oath, that, forms, the, basis, of, the, religion, and, which, non, muslims, wishing, to, convert, must, recite, declaring, that, i, testify, that, there, is, no, deity, except, god, in, christianity, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, describes, god, as, one, god, in, father, son, jesus, and, holy, spirit, in, past, centuries, this, fundamental, mystery, of, the, christian, faith, was, also, summarized, by, the, latin, formula, sancta, trinitas, unus, deus, holy, trinity, unique, god, reported, in, the, litanias, lauretanas, god, in, hinduism, is, viewed, differently, by, diverse, strands, of, the, religion, with, most, hindus, having, faith, in, a, supreme, reality, brahman, who, can, be, manifested, in, numerous, chosen, deities, thus, the, religion, is, sometimes, characterized, as, polymorphic, monotheism, henotheism, is, the, belief, and, worship, of, a, single, god, at, a, time, while, accepting, the, validity, of, worshiping, other, deities, monolatry, is, the, belief, in, a, single, deity, worthy, of, worship, while, accepting, the, existence, of, other, deities, transcendence, is, the, aspect, of, god, s, nature, that, is, completely, independent, of, the, material, universe, and, its, physical, laws, many, supposed, characteristics, of, god, are, described, in, human, terms, anselm, thought, that, god, did, not, feel, emotions, such, as, anger, or, love, but, appeared, to, do, so, through, our, imperfect, understanding, the, incongruity, of, judging, being, against, something, that, might, not, exist, led, many, medieval, philosophers, approach, to, knowledge, of, god, through, negative, attributes, called, negative, theology, for, example, one, should, not, say, that, god, is, wise, but, can, say, that, god, is, not, ignorant, i, e, in, some, way, god, has, some, properties, of, knowledge, christian, theologian, alister, mcgrath, writes, that, one, has, to, understand, a, personal, god, as, an, analogy, to, say, that, god, is, like, a, person, is, to, affirm, the, divine, ability, and, willingness, to, relate, to, others, this, does, not, imply, that, god, is, human, or, located, at, a, specific, point, in, the, universe, pantheism, holds, that, god, is, the, universe, and, the, universe, is, god, and, denies, that, god, transcends, the, universe, for, pantheist, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, the, whole, of, the, natural, universe, is, made, of, one, substance, god, or, its, equivalent, nature, pantheism, is, sometimes, objected, to, as, not, providing, any, meaningful, explanation, of, god, with, the, german, philosopher, schopenhauer, stating, pantheism, is, only, a, euphemism, for, atheism, pandeism, holds, that, god, was, a, separate, entity, but, then, became, the, universe, panentheism, holds, that, god, contains, but, is, not, identical, to, the, universe, god, is, often, viewed, as, the, cause, of, all, that, exists, for, pythagoreans, monad, variously, referred, to, divinity, the, first, being, or, an, indivisible, origin, the, philosophy, of, plato, and, plotinus, refers, to, the, one, which, is, the, first, principle, of, reality, that, is, beyond, being, and, is, both, the, source, of, the, universe, and, the, teleological, purpose, of, all, things, aristotle, theorized, a, first, uncaused, cause, for, all, motion, in, the, universe, and, viewed, it, as, perfectly, beautiful, immaterial, unchanging, and, indivisible, aseity, is, the, property, of, not, depending, on, any, cause, other, than, itself, for, its, existence, avicenna, held, that, there, must, be, a, necessarily, existent, guaranteed, to, exist, by, its, essence, it, cannot, not, exist, and, that, humans, identify, this, as, god, secondary, causation, refers, to, god, creating, the, laws, of, the, universe, which, then, can, change, themselves, within, the, framework, of, those, laws, in, addition, to, the, initial, creation, occasionalism, refers, to, the, idea, that, the, universe, would, not, by, default, continue, to, exist, from, one, instant, to, the, next, and, so, would, need, to, rely, on, god, as, a, sustainer, while, divine, providence, refers, to, any, intervention, by, god, it, is, usually, used, to, refer, to, special, providence, where, there, is, an, extraordinary, intervention, by, god, such, as, miracles, deism, holds, that, god, exists, but, does, not, intervene, in, the, world, beyond, what, was, necessary, to, create, it, such, as, answering, prayers, or, producing, miracles, deists, sometimes, attribute, this, to, god, having, no, interest, in, or, not, being, aware, of, humanity, pandeists, would, hold, that, god, does, not, intervene, because, god, is, the, universe, of, those, theists, who, hold, that, god, has, an, interest, in, humanity, most, hold, that, god, is, omnipotent, omniscient, and, benevolent, this, belief, raises, questions, about, god, s, responsibility, for, evil, and, suffering, in, the, world, dystheism, which, is, related, to, theodicy, is, a, form, of, theism, which, holds, that, god, is, either, not, wholly, good, or, is, fully, malevolent, as, a, consequence, of, the, problem, of, evil, omnipotence, all, powerful, is, an, attribute, often, ascribed, to, god, the, omnipotence, paradox, is, most, often, framed, with, the, example, could, god, create, a, stone, so, heavy, that, even, he, could, not, lift, it, as, god, could, either, be, unable, to, create, that, stone, or, lift, that, stone, and, so, could, not, be, omnipotent, this, is, often, countered, with, variations, of, the, argument, that, omnipotence, like, any, other, attribute, ascribed, to, god, only, applies, as, far, as, it, is, noble, enough, to, befit, god, and, thus, god, cannot, lie, or, do, what, is, contradictory, as, that, would, entail, opposing, himself, omniscience, all, knowing, is, an, attribute, often, ascribed, to, god, this, implies, that, god, knows, how, free, agents, will, choose, to, act, if, god, does, know, this, either, their, free, will, might, be, illusory, or, foreknowledge, does, not, imply, predestination, and, if, god, does, not, know, it, god, may, not, be, omniscient, open, theism, limits, god, s, omniscience, by, contending, that, due, to, the, nature, of, time, god, s, omniscience, does, not, mean, the, deity, can, predict, the, future, and, process, theology, holds, that, god, does, not, have, immutability, so, is, affected, by, his, creation, theologians, of, theistic, personalism, the, view, held, by, ren, descartes, isaac, newton, alvin, plantinga, richard, swinburne, william, lane, craig, and, most, modern, evangelicals, argue, that, god, is, most, generally, the, ground, of, all, being, immanent, in, and, transcendent, over, the, whole, world, of, reality, with, immanence, and, transcendence, being, the, contrapletes, of, personality, god, has, also, been, conceived, as, being, incorporeal, immaterial, a, personal, being, the, source, of, all, moral, obligation, and, the, greatest, conceivable, existent, these, attributes, were, all, supported, to, varying, degrees, by, the, early, jewish, christian, and, muslim, theologian, philosophers, including, maimonides, augustine, of, hippo, and, al, ghazali, respectively, jainism, has, generally, rejected, creationism, holding, that, soul, substances, j, va, are, uncreated, and, that, time, is, beginningless, some, interpretations, and, traditions, of, buddhism, can, be, conceived, as, being, non, theistic, buddhism, has, generally, rejected, the, specific, monotheistic, view, of, a, creator, god, the, buddha, criticizes, the, theory, of, creationism, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, also, major, indian, buddhist, philosophers, such, as, nagarjuna, vasubandhu, dharmakirti, and, buddhaghosa, consistently, critiqued, creator, god, views, put, forth, by, hindu, thinkers, however, as, a, non, theistic, religion, buddhism, leaves, the, existence, of, a, supreme, deity, ambiguous, there, are, significant, numbers, of, buddhists, who, believe, in, god, and, there, are, equally, large, numbers, who, deny, god, s, existence, or, are, unsure, taoic, religions, such, as, confucianism, and, taoism, are, silent, on, the, existence, of, creator, gods, however, keeping, with, the, tradition, of, ancestor, veneration, in, china, adherents, worship, the, spirits, of, people, such, as, confucius, and, lao, tzu, in, a, similar, manner, to, god, some, atheists, have, argued, that, a, single, omniscient, god, who, is, imagined, to, have, created, the, universe, and, is, particularly, attentive, to, the, lives, of, humans, has, been, imagined, and, embellished, over, generations, pascal, boyer, argues, that, while, there, is, a, wide, array, of, supernatural, concepts, found, around, the, world, in, general, supernatural, beings, tend, to, behave, much, like, people, the, construction, of, gods, and, spirits, like, persons, is, one, of, the, best, known, traits, of, religion, he, cites, examples, from, greek, mythology, which, is, in, his, opinion, more, like, a, modern, soap, opera, than, other, religious, systems, bertrand, du, castel, and, timothy, jurgensen, demonstrate, through, formalization, that, boyer, s, explanatory, model, matches, physics, epistemology, in, positing, not, directly, observable, entities, as, intermediaries, anthropologist, stewart, guthrie, contends, that, people, project, human, features, onto, non, human, aspects, of, the, world, because, it, makes, those, aspects, more, familiar, sigmund, freud, also, suggested, that, god, concepts, are, projections, of, one, s, father, likewise, mile, durkheim, was, one, of, the, earliest, to, suggest, that, gods, represent, an, extension, of, human, social, life, to, include, supernatural, beings, in, line, with, this, reasoning, psychologist, matt, rossano, contends, that, when, humans, began, living, in, larger, groups, they, may, have, created, gods, as, a, means, of, enforcing, morality, in, small, groups, morality, can, be, enforced, by, social, forces, such, as, gossip, or, reputation, however, it, is, much, harder, to, enforce, morality, using, social, forces, in, much, larger, groups, rossano, indicates, that, by, including, ever, watchful, gods, and, spirits, humans, discovered, an, effective, strategy, for, restraining, selfishness, and, building, more, cooperative, groups, sam, harris, has, interpreted, some, findings, in, neuroscience, to, argue, that, god, is, an, imaginary, entity, only, with, no, basis, in, reality, johns, hopkins, researchers, studying, the, effects, of, the, spirit, molecule, dmt, which, is, both, an, endogenous, molecule, in, the, human, brain, and, the, active, molecule, in, the, psychedelic, ayahuasca, found, that, a, large, majority, of, respondents, said, dmt, brought, them, into, contact, with, a, conscious, intelligent, benevolent, and, sacred, entity, and, describe, interactions, that, oozed, joy, trust, love, and, kindness, more, than, half, of, those, who, had, previously, self, identified, as, atheists, described, some, type, of, belief, in, a, higher, power, or, god, after, the, experience, about, a, quarter, of, those, afflicted, by, temporal, lobe, seizures, experience, what, is, described, as, a, religious, experience, and, may, become, preoccupied, by, thoughts, of, god, even, if, they, were, not, previously, neuroscientist, v, s, ramachandran, hypothesizes, that, seizures, in, the, temporal, lobe, which, is, closely, connected, to, the, emotional, center, of, the, brain, the, limbic, system, may, lead, to, those, afflicted, to, view, even, banal, objects, with, heightened, meaning, psychologists, studying, feelings, of, awe, found, that, participants, feeling, awe, after, watching, scenes, of, natural, wonders, become, more, likely, to, believe, in, a, supernatural, being, and, to, see, events, as, the, result, of, design, even, when, given, randomly, generated, numbers, theistic, religious, traditions, often, require, worship, of, god, and, sometimes, hold, that, the, purpose, of, existence, is, to, worship, god, to, address, the, issue, of, an, all, powerful, being, demanding, to, be, worshipped, it, is, held, that, god, does, not, need, or, benefit, from, worship, but, that, worship, is, for, the, benefit, of, the, worshipper, gandhi, expressed, the, view, that, god, does, not, need, his, supplication, and, that, prayer, is, not, an, asking, it, is, a, longing, of, the, soul, it, is, a, daily, admission, of, one, s, weakness, invoking, god, in, prayer, plays, a, significant, role, among, many, believers, depending, on, the, tradition, god, can, be, viewed, as, a, personal, god, who, is, only, to, be, invoked, directly, while, other, traditions, allow, praying, to, intermediaries, such, as, saints, to, intercede, on, their, behalf, prayer, often, also, includes, supplication, such, as, asking, forgiveness, god, is, often, believed, to, be, forgiving, for, example, a, hadith, states, god, would, replace, a, sinless, people, with, one, who, sinned, but, still, asked, repentance, sacrifice, for, the, sake, of, god, is, another, act, of, devotion, that, includes, fasting, and, almsgiving, remembrance, of, god, in, daily, life, include, mentioning, interjections, thanking, god, when, feeling, gratitude, or, phrases, of, adoration, such, as, repeating, chants, while, performing, other, activities, transtheistic, religious, traditions, may, believe, in, the, existence, of, deities, but, deny, any, spiritual, significance, to, them, the, term, has, been, used, to, describe, certain, strands, of, buddhism, jainism, and, stoicism, among, religions, that, do, attach, spirituality, to, the, relationship, with, god, disagree, as, how, to, best, worship, god, and, what, is, god, s, plan, for, mankind, there, are, different, approaches, to, reconciling, the, contradictory, claims, of, monotheistic, religions, one, view, is, taken, by, exclusivists, who, believe, they, are, the, chosen, people, or, have, exclusive, access, to, absolute, truth, generally, through, revelation, or, encounter, with, the, divine, which, adherents, of, other, religions, do, not, another, view, is, religious, pluralism, a, pluralist, typically, believes, that, his, religion, is, the, right, one, but, does, not, deny, the, partial, truth, of, other, religions, the, view, that, all, theists, actually, worship, the, same, god, whether, they, know, it, or, not, is, especially, emphasized, in, the, bah, faith, hinduism, and, sikhism, the, bah, faith, preaches, that, divine, manifestations, include, great, prophets, and, teachers, of, many, of, the, major, religious, traditions, such, as, krishna, buddha, jesus, zoroaster, muhammad, bah, ll, h, and, also, preaches, the, unity, of, all, religions, and, focuses, on, these, multiple, epiphanies, as, necessary, for, meeting, the, needs, of, humanity, at, different, points, in, history, and, for, different, cultures, and, as, part, of, a, scheme, of, progressive, revelation, and, education, of, humanity, an, example, of, a, pluralist, view, in, christianity, is, supersessionism, i, e, the, belief, that, one, s, religion, is, the, fulfillment, of, previous, religions, a, third, approach, is, relativistic, inclusivism, where, everybody, is, seen, as, equally, right, an, example, being, universalism, the, doctrine, that, salvation, is, eventually, available, for, everyone, a, fourth, approach, is, syncretism, mixing, different, elements, from, different, religions, an, example, of, syncretism, is, the, new, age, movement, fideism, is, the, position, that, in, certain, topics, notably, theology, such, as, in, reformed, epistemology, faith, is, superior, than, reason, in, arriving, at, truths, some, theists, argue, that, there, is, value, to, the, risk, in, having, faith, and, that, if, the, arguments, for, god, s, existence, were, as, rational, as, the, laws, of, physics, then, there, would, be, no, risk, such, theists, often, argue, that, the, heart, is, attracted, to, beauty, truth, and, goodness, and, so, would, be, best, for, dictating, about, god, as, illustrated, through, blaise, pascal, who, said, the, heart, has, its, reasons, that, reason, does, not, know, a, hadith, attributes, a, quote, to, god, as, i, am, what, my, slave, thinks, of, me, inherent, intuition, about, god, is, referred, to, in, islam, as, fitra, or, innate, nature, in, confucian, tradition, confucius, and, mencius, promoted, that, the, only, justification, for, right, conduct, called, the, way, is, what, is, dictated, by, heaven, a, more, or, less, anthropomorphic, higher, power, and, is, implanted, in, humans, and, thus, there, is, only, one, universal, foundation, for, the, way, revelation, refers, to, some, form, of, message, communicated, by, god, this, is, usually, proposed, to, occur, through, the, use, of, prophets, or, angels, al, maturidi, argued, for, the, need, for, revelation, because, even, though, humans, are, intellectually, capable, of, realizing, god, human, desire, can, divert, the, intellect, and, because, certain, knowledge, cannot, be, known, except, when, specially, given, to, prophets, such, as, the, specifications, of, acts, of, worship, it, is, argued, that, there, is, also, that, which, overlaps, between, what, is, revealed, and, what, can, be, derived, according, to, islam, one, of, the, earliest, revelations, to, ever, be, revealed, was, if, you, feel, no, shame, then, do, as, you, wish, the, term, general, revelation, is, used, to, refer, to, knowledge, revealed, about, god, outside, of, direct, or, special, revelation, such, as, scriptures, notably, this, includes, studying, nature, sometimes, seen, as, the, book, of, nature, an, idiom, in, arabic, states, the, qur, an, is, a, universe, that, speaks, the, universe, is, a, silent, qur, an, on, matters, of, theology, some, such, as, richard, swinburne, take, an, evidentialist, position, where, a, belief, is, only, justified, if, it, has, a, reason, behind, it, as, opposed, to, holding, it, as, a, foundational, belief, traditionalist, theology, holds, that, one, should, not, opinionate, beyond, revelation, to, understand, god, s, nature, and, frown, upon, rationalizations, such, as, speculative, theology, notably, for, anthropomorphic, descriptions, such, as, the, hand, of, god, and, attributes, of, god, they, neither, nullify, such, texts, nor, accept, a, literal, hand, but, leave, any, ambiguity, to, god, called, tafwid, without, asking, how, physico, theology, provides, arguments, for, theological, topics, based, on, reason, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, the, bible, has, been, the, principal, source, of, the, conceptions, of, god, that, the, bible, includes, many, different, images, concepts, and, ways, of, thinking, about, god, has, resulted, in, perpetual, disagreements, about, how, god, is, to, be, conceived, and, understood, throughout, the, hebrew, and, christian, bibles, there, are, titles, for, god, who, revealed, his, personal, name, as, yhwh, often, vocalized, as, yahweh, or, jehovah, one, of, them, is, elohim, another, one, is, el, shaddai, translated, god, almighty, a, third, notable, title, is, el, elyon, which, means, the, high, god, also, noted, in, the, hebrew, and, christian, bibles, is, the, name, i, am, that, i, am, god, is, described, and, referred, in, the, quran, and, hadith, by, certain, names, or, attributes, the, most, common, being, al, rahman, meaning, most, compassionate, and, al, rahim, meaning, most, merciful, many, of, these, names, are, also, used, in, the, scriptures, of, the, bah, faith, vaishnavism, a, tradition, in, hinduism, has, a, list, of, titles, and, names, of, krishna, the, gender, of, god, may, be, viewed, as, either, a, literal, or, an, allegorical, aspect, of, a, deity, who, in, classical, western, philosophy, transcends, bodily, form, polytheistic, religions, commonly, attribute, to, each, of, the, gods, a, gender, allowing, each, to, interact, with, any, of, the, others, and, perhaps, with, humans, sexually, in, most, monotheistic, religions, god, has, no, counterpart, with, which, to, relate, sexually, thus, in, classical, western, philosophy, the, gender, of, this, one, and, only, deity, is, most, likely, to, be, an, analogical, statement, of, how, humans, and, god, address, and, relate, to, each, other, namely, god, is, seen, as, begetter, of, the, world, and, revelation, which, corresponds, to, the, active, as, opposed, to, the, receptive, role, in, sexual, intercourse, biblical, sources, usually, refer, to, god, using, male, or, paternal, words, and, symbolism, except, genesis, 1, 26, 27, psalm, 123, 2, 3, and, luke, 15, 8, 10, female, hosea, 11, 3, 4, deuteronomy, 32, 18, isaiah, 66, 13, isaiah, 49, 15, isaiah, 42, 14, psalm, 131, 2, a, mother, deuteronomy, 32, 11, 12, a, mother, eagle, and, matthew, 23, 37, and, luke, 13, 34, a, mother, hen, in, sikhism, god, is, ajuni, without, incarnations, which, means, that, god, is, not, bound, to, any, physical, forms, this, concludes, that, the, all, pervading, lord, is, gender, less, however, the, guru, granth, sahib, constantly, refers, to, god, as, he, and, father, with, some, exceptions, typically, because, the, guru, granth, sahib, was, written, in, north, indian, indo, aryan, languages, mixture, of, punjabi, and, sant, bhasha, sanskrit, with, influences, of, persian, which, have, no, neutral, gender, from, further, insights, into, the, sikh, philosophy, it, can, be, deduced, that, god, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, husband, to, the, soul, brides, in, order, to, make, a, patriarchal, society, understand, what, the, relationship, with, god, is, like, also, god, is, considered, to, be, the, father, mother, and, companion, in, zoroastrianism, during, the, early, parthian, empire, ahura, mazda, was, visually, represented, for, worship, this, practice, ended, during, the, beginning, of, the, sasanian, empire, zoroastrian, iconoclasm, which, can, be, traced, to, the, end, of, the, parthian, period, and, the, beginning, of, the, sassanid, eventually, put, an, end, to, the, use, of, all, images, of, ahura, mazda, in, worship, however, ahura, mazda, continued, to, be, symbolized, by, a, dignified, male, figure, standing, or, on, horseback, which, is, found, in, sassanian, investiture, deities, from, near, eastern, cultures, are, often, thought, of, as, anthropomorphic, entities, who, have, a, human, like, body, which, is, however, not, equal, to, a, human, body, such, bodies, were, often, thought, to, be, radiant, or, fiery, of, superhuman, size, or, extreme, beauty, the, ancient, deity, of, the, israelites, yahweh, too, was, imagined, as, a, transcendent, but, still, anthropomorphic, deity, humans, could, not, see, him, because, of, their, impurity, in, contrast, to, yahweh, s, holiness, yahweh, being, described, as, radiating, fire, and, light, which, could, kill, a, human, if, looking, at, him, further, more, religious, or, spiritual, people, tend, to, have, less, anthropomorphic, depictions, of, god, in, judaism, the, torah, often, ascribes, human, features, to, god, however, many, other, passages, describe, god, as, formless, and, otherworldly, judaism, is, aniconic, meaning, it, overly, lacks, material, physical, representations, of, both, the, natural, and, supernatural, worlds, furthermore, the, worship, of, idols, is, strictly, forbidden, the, traditional, view, elaborated, by, figures, such, as, maimonides, reckons, that, god, is, wholly, incomprehensible, and, therefore, impossible, to, envision, resulting, in, a, historical, tradition, of, divine, incorporeality, as, such, attempting, to, describe, god, s, appearance, in, practical, terms, is, considered, disrespectful, to, the, deity, and, thus, is, taboo, and, arguably, heretical, gnostic, cosmogony, often, depicts, the, creator, god, of, the, old, testament, as, an, evil, lesser, deity, or, demiurge, while, the, higher, benevolent, god, or, monad, is, thought, of, as, something, beyond, comprehension, having, immeasurable, light, and, not, in, time, or, among, things, that, exist, but, rather, is, greater, than, them, in, a, sense, all, people, are, said, to, have, a, piece, of, god, or, divine, spark, within, them, which, has, fallen, from, the, immaterial, world, into, the, corrupt, material, world, and, is, trapped, unless, gnosis, is, attained, early, christians, believed, that, the, words, of, the, gospel, of, john, 1, 18, no, man, has, seen, god, at, any, time, and, numerous, other, statements, were, meant, to, apply, not, only, to, god, but, to, all, attempts, at, the, depiction, of, god, however, later, depictions, of, god, are, found, some, like, the, hand, of, god, are, depiction, borrowed, from, jewish, art, prior, to, the, 10th, century, no, attempt, was, made, to, use, a, human, to, symbolize, god, the, father, in, western, art, yet, western, art, eventually, required, some, way, to, illustrate, the, presence, of, the, father, so, through, successive, representations, a, set, of, artistic, styles, for, symbolizing, the, father, using, a, man, gradually, emerged, around, the, 10th, century, ad, a, rationale, for, the, use, of, a, human, is, the, belief, that, god, created, the, soul, of, man, in, the, image, of, his, own, thus, allowing, humans, to, transcend, the, other, animals, it, appears, that, when, early, artists, designed, to, represent, god, the, father, fear, and, awe, restrained, them, from, a, usage, of, the, whole, human, figure, typically, only, a, small, part, would, be, used, as, the, image, usually, the, hand, or, sometimes, the, face, but, rarely, a, whole, human, in, many, images, the, figure, of, the, son, supplants, the, father, so, a, smaller, portion, of, the, person, of, the, father, is, depicted, by, the, 12th, century, depictions, of, god, the, father, had, started, to, appear, in, french, illuminated, manuscripts, which, as, a, less, public, form, could, often, be, more, adventurous, in, their, iconography, and, in, stained, glass, church, windows, in, england, initially, the, head, or, bust, was, usually, shown, in, some, form, of, frame, of, clouds, in, the, top, of, the, picture, space, where, the, hand, of, god, had, formerly, appeared, the, baptism, of, christ, on, the, famous, baptismal, font, in, li, ge, of, rainer, of, huy, is, an, example, from, 1118, a, hand, of, god, is, used, in, another, scene, gradually, the, amount, of, the, human, symbol, shown, can, increase, to, a, half, length, figure, then, a, full, length, usually, enthroned, as, in, giotto, s, fresco, of, c, 1305, in, padua, in, the, 14th, century, the, naples, bible, carried, a, depiction, of, god, the, father, in, the, burning, bush, by, the, early, 15th, century, the, tr, s, riches, heures, du, duc, de, berry, had, a, considerable, number, of, symbols, including, an, elderly, but, tall, and, elegant, full, length, figure, walking, in, the, garden, of, eden, which, show, a, considerable, diversity, of, apparent, ages, and, dress, the, gates, of, paradise, of, the, florence, baptistry, by, lorenzo, ghiberti, begun, in, 1425, use, a, similar, tall, full, length, symbol, for, the, father, the, rohan, book, of, hours, of, about, 1430, also, included, depictions, of, god, the, father, in, half, length, human, form, which, were, now, becoming, standard, and, the, hand, of, god, becoming, rarer, at, the, same, period, other, works, like, the, large, genesis, altarpiece, by, the, hamburg, painter, meister, bertram, continued, to, use, the, old, depiction, of, christ, as, logos, in, genesis, scenes, in, the, 15th, century, there, was, a, brief, fashion, for, depicting, all, three, persons, of, the, trinity, as, similar, or, identical, figures, with, the, usual, appearance, of, christ, in, a, trinitarian, piet, god, the, father, is, often, symbolized, using, a, man, wearing, a, papal, dress, and, a, papal, crown, supporting, the, dead, christ, in, his, arms, in, 1667, the, 43rd, chapter, of, the, great, moscow, council, specifically, included, a, ban, on, a, number, of, symbolic, depictions, of, god, the, father, and, the, holy, spirit, which, then, also, resulted, in, a, range, of, other, icons, being, placed, on, the, forbidden, list, mostly, affecting, western, style, depictions, which, had, been, gaining, ground, in, orthodox, icons, the, council, also, declared, that, the, person, of, the, trinity, who, was, the, ancient, of, days, was, christ, as, logos, not, god, the, father, however, some, icons, continued, to, be, produced, in, russia, as, well, as, greece, romania, and, other, orthodox, countries, in, islam, muslims, believe, that, god, allah, is, beyond, all, comprehension, and, does, not, resemble, any, of, his, creations, in, any, way, muslims, tend, to, use, the, least, anthropomorphism, among, monotheists, they, are, not, iconodules, and, have, religious, calligraphy, of, titles, of, god, instead, of, pictures, footnotes,
