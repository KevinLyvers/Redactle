anglicanism, is, a, western, christian, tradition, which, developed, from, the, practices, liturgy, and, identity, of, the, church, of, england, following, the, english, reformation, in, the, context, of, the, protestant, reformation, in, europe, it, is, one, of, the, largest, branches, of, christianity, with, around, 110, million, adherents, worldwide, as, of, 2001, adherents, of, anglicanism, are, called, anglicans, they, are, also, called, episcopalians, in, some, countries, the, majority, of, anglicans, are, members, of, national, or, regional, ecclesiastical, provinces, of, the, international, anglican, communion, which, forms, the, third, largest, christian, communion, in, the, world, after, the, catholic, church, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, world, s, largest, protestant, communion, these, provinces, are, in, full, communion, with, the, see, of, canterbury, and, thus, with, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, whom, the, communion, refers, to, as, its, primus, inter, pares, latin, first, among, equals, the, archbishop, calls, the, decennial, lambeth, conference, chairs, the, meeting, of, primates, and, is, the, president, of, the, anglican, consultative, council, some, churches, that, are, not, part, of, the, anglican, communion, or, recognised, by, it, also, call, themselves, anglican, including, those, that, are, within, the, continuing, anglican, movement, and, anglican, realignment, anglicans, base, their, christian, faith, on, the, bible, traditions, of, the, apostolic, church, apostolic, succession, historic, episcopate, and, the, writings, of, the, church, fathers, as, well, as, historically, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, religion, and, the, books, of, homilies, anglicanism, forms, a, branch, of, western, christianity, having, definitively, declared, its, independence, from, the, holy, see, at, the, time, of, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, many, of, the, anglican, formularies, of, the, mid, 16th, century, correspond, closely, to, those, of, historical, protestantism, these, reforms, were, understood, by, one, of, those, most, responsible, for, them, thomas, cranmer, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, others, as, navigating, a, middle, way, between, two, of, the, emerging, protestant, traditions, namely, lutheranism, and, calvinism, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, church, of, england, and, the, associated, church, of, ireland, were, presented, by, some, anglican, divines, as, comprising, a, distinct, christian, tradition, with, theologies, structures, and, forms, of, worship, representing, a, different, kind, of, middle, way, or, via, media, originally, between, lutheranism, and, calvinism, and, later, between, protestantism, and, catholicism, a, perspective, that, came, to, be, highly, influential, in, later, theories, of, anglican, identity, and, expressed, in, the, description, of, anglicanism, as, catholic, and, reformed, the, degree, of, distinction, between, protestant, and, catholic, tendencies, within, anglicanism, is, routinely, a, matter, of, debate, both, within, specific, anglican, churches, and, the, anglican, communion, the, book, of, common, prayer, is, unique, to, anglicanism, the, collection, of, services, in, one, prayer, book, used, for, centuries, the, book, is, acknowledged, as, a, principal, tie, that, binds, the, anglican, communion, as, a, liturgical, tradition, after, the, american, revolution, anglican, congregations, in, the, united, states, and, british, north, america, which, would, later, form, the, basis, for, the, modern, country, of, canada, were, each, reconstituted, into, autonomous, churches, with, their, own, bishops, and, self, governing, structures, these, were, known, as, the, american, episcopal, church, and, the, church, of, england, in, the, dominion, of, canada, through, the, expansion, of, the, british, empire, and, the, activity, of, christian, missions, this, model, was, adopted, as, the, model, for, many, newly, formed, churches, especially, in, africa, australasia, and, the, asia, pacific, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, anglicanism, was, coined, to, describe, the, common, religious, tradition, of, these, churches, and, also, that, of, the, scottish, episcopal, church, which, though, originating, earlier, within, the, church, of, scotland, had, come, to, be, recognised, as, sharing, this, common, identity, the, word, anglican, originates, in, anglicana, ecclesia, libera, sit, a, phrase, from, magna, carta, dated, 15, june, 1215, meaning, the, english, church, shall, be, free, adherents, of, anglicanism, are, called, anglicans, as, an, adjective, anglican, is, used, to, describe, the, people, institutions, churches, liturgical, traditions, and, theological, concepts, developed, by, the, church, of, england, as, a, noun, an, anglican, is, a, church, member, in, the, anglican, communion, the, word, is, also, used, by, followers, of, separated, groups, that, have, left, the, communion, or, have, been, founded, separately, from, it, the, word, originally, referred, only, to, the, teachings, and, rites, of, christians, throughout, the, world, in, communion, with, the, see, of, canterbury, but, has, come, to, sometimes, be, extended, to, any, church, following, those, traditions, rather, than, actual, membership, in, the, anglican, communion, although, the, term, anglican, is, found, referring, to, the, church, of, england, as, far, back, as, the, 16th, century, its, use, did, not, become, general, until, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, in, british, parliamentary, legislation, referring, to, the, english, established, church, there, is, no, need, for, a, description, it, is, simply, the, church, of, england, though, the, word, protestant, is, used, in, many, legal, acts, specifying, the, succession, to, the, crown, and, qualifications, for, office, when, the, union, with, ireland, act, created, the, united, church, of, england, and, ireland, it, is, specified, that, it, shall, be, one, protestant, episcopal, church, thereby, distinguishing, its, form, of, church, government, from, the, presbyterian, polity, that, prevails, in, the, church, of, scotland, the, word, episcopal, is, preferred, in, the, title, of, the, episcopal, church, the, province, of, the, anglican, communion, covering, the, united, states, and, the, scottish, episcopal, church, though, the, full, name, of, the, former, is, the, protestant, episcopal, church, in, the, united, states, of, america, elsewhere, however, the, term, anglican, church, came, to, be, preferred, as, it, distinguished, these, churches, from, others, that, maintain, an, episcopal, polity, in, its, structures, theology, and, forms, of, worship, anglicanism, emerged, as, a, distinct, christian, tradition, representing, a, middle, ground, between, lutheran, and, reformed, varieties, of, protestantism, after, the, oxford, movement, anglicanism, has, often, been, characterized, as, representing, a, via, media, middle, way, between, protestantism, as, a, whole, and, catholicism, the, faith, of, anglicans, is, founded, in, the, scriptures, and, the, gospels, the, traditions, of, the, apostolic, church, the, historical, episcopate, the, first, four, ecumenical, councils, and, the, early, church, fathers, especially, those, active, during, the, five, initial, centuries, of, christianity, according, to, the, quinquasaecularist, principle, proposed, by, the, english, bishop, lancelot, andrewes, and, the, lutheran, dissident, georg, calixtus, anglicans, understand, the, old, and, new, testaments, as, containing, all, things, necessary, for, salvation, and, as, being, the, rule, and, ultimate, standard, of, faith, reason, and, tradition, are, seen, as, valuable, means, to, interpret, scripture, a, position, first, formulated, in, detail, by, richard, hooker, but, there, is, no, full, mutual, agreement, among, anglicans, about, exactly, how, scripture, reason, and, tradition, interact, or, ought, to, interact, with, each, other, anglicans, understand, the, apostles, creed, as, the, baptismal, symbol, and, the, nicene, creed, as, the, sufficient, statement, of, the, christian, faith, anglicans, believe, the, catholic, and, apostolic, faith, is, revealed, in, holy, scripture, and, the, ecumenical, creeds, apostles, nicene, and, athanasian, and, interpret, these, in, light, of, the, christian, tradition, of, the, historic, church, scholarship, reason, and, experience, anglicans, celebrate, the, traditional, sacraments, with, special, emphasis, being, given, to, the, eucharist, also, called, holy, communion, the, lord, s, supper, or, the, mass, the, eucharist, is, central, to, worship, for, most, anglicans, as, a, communal, offering, of, prayer, and, praise, in, which, the, life, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, are, proclaimed, through, prayer, reading, of, the, bible, singing, giving, god, thanks, over, the, bread, and, wine, for, the, innumerable, benefits, obtained, through, the, passion, of, christ, the, breaking, of, the, bread, the, blessing, of, the, cup, and, the, partaking, of, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, as, instituted, at, the, last, supper, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, which, are, considered, by, anglican, formularies, to, be, the, true, body, and, blood, of, christ, in, a, spiritual, manner, and, as, outward, symbols, of, an, inner, grace, given, by, christ, which, to, the, repentant, convey, forgiveness, and, cleansing, from, sin, while, many, anglicans, celebrate, the, eucharist, in, similar, ways, to, the, predominant, latin, catholic, tradition, a, considerable, degree, of, liturgical, freedom, is, permitted, and, worship, styles, range, from, simple, to, elaborate, unique, to, anglicanism, is, the, book, of, common, prayer, bcp, the, collection, of, services, which, worshippers, in, most, anglican, churches, have, used, for, centuries, it, was, called, common, prayer, originally, because, it, was, intended, for, use, in, all, church, of, england, churches, which, had, previously, followed, differing, local, liturgies, the, term, was, kept, when, the, church, became, international, because, all, anglicans, used, to, share, in, its, use, around, the, world, in, 1549, the, first, book, of, common, prayer, was, compiled, by, thomas, cranmer, the, then, archbishop, of, canterbury, while, it, has, since, undergone, many, revisions, and, anglican, churches, in, different, countries, have, developed, other, service, books, the, prayer, book, is, still, acknowledged, as, one, of, the, ties, that, bind, anglicans, together, according, to, legend, the, founding, of, christianity, in, britain, is, commonly, attributed, to, joseph, of, arimathea, and, is, commemorated, at, glastonbury, abbey, many, of, the, early, church, fathers, wrote, of, the, presence, of, christianity, in, roman, britain, with, tertullian, stating, those, parts, of, britain, into, which, the, roman, arms, had, never, penetrated, were, become, subject, to, christ, saint, alban, who, was, executed, in, ad, 209, is, the, first, christian, martyr, in, the, british, isles, for, this, reason, he, is, venerated, as, the, british, protomartyr, the, historian, heinrich, zimmer, writes, that, just, as, britain, was, a, part, of, the, roman, empire, so, the, british, church, formed, during, the, fourth, century, a, branch, of, the, catholic, church, of, the, west, and, during, the, whole, of, that, century, from, the, council, of, arles, 316, onward, took, part, in, all, proceedings, concerning, the, church, after, roman, troops, withdrew, from, britain, the, absence, of, roman, military, and, governmental, influence, and, overall, decline, of, roman, imperial, political, power, enabled, britain, and, the, surrounding, isles, to, develop, distinctively, from, the, rest, of, the, west, a, new, culture, emerged, around, the, irish, sea, among, the, celtic, peoples, with, celtic, christianity, at, its, core, what, resulted, was, a, form, of, christianity, distinct, from, rome, in, many, traditions, and, practices, the, historian, charles, thomas, in, addition, to, the, celticist, heinrich, zimmer, writes, that, the, distinction, between, sub, roman, and, post, roman, insular, christianity, also, known, as, celtic, christianity, began, to, become, apparent, around, ad, 475, with, the, celtic, churches, allowing, married, clergy, observing, lent, and, easter, according, to, their, own, calendar, and, having, a, different, tonsure, moreover, like, the, eastern, orthodox, and, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, celtic, churches, operated, independently, of, the, pope, s, authority, as, a, result, of, their, isolated, development, in, the, british, isles, in, what, is, known, as, the, gregorian, mission, pope, gregory, i, sent, augustine, of, canterbury, to, the, british, isles, in, ad, 596, with, the, purpose, of, evangelising, the, pagans, there, who, were, largely, anglo, saxons, as, well, as, to, reconcile, the, celtic, churches, in, the, british, isles, to, the, see, of, rome, in, kent, augustine, persuaded, the, anglo, saxon, king, thelberht, and, his, people, to, accept, christianity, augustine, on, two, occasions, met, in, conference, with, members, of, the, celtic, episcopacy, but, no, understanding, was, reached, between, them, eventually, the, christian, church, of, the, anglo, saxon, kingdom, of, northumbria, convened, the, synod, of, whitby, in, 663, 664, to, decide, whether, to, follow, celtic, or, roman, usages, this, meeting, with, king, oswiu, as, the, final, decision, maker, led, to, the, acceptance, of, roman, usage, elsewhere, in, england, and, brought, the, english, church, into, close, contact, with, the, continent, as, a, result, of, assuming, roman, usages, the, celtic, church, surrendered, its, independence, and, from, this, point, on, the, church, in, england, was, no, longer, purely, celtic, but, became, anglo, roman, celtic, the, theologian, christopher, l, webber, writes, that, although, the, roman, form, of, christianity, became, the, dominant, influence, in, britain, as, in, all, of, western, europe, anglican, christianity, has, continued, to, have, a, distinctive, quality, because, of, its, celtic, heritage, the, church, in, england, remained, united, with, rome, until, the, english, parliament, though, the, act, of, supremacy, 1534, declared, king, henry, viii, to, be, the, supreme, head, of, the, church, of, england, to, fulfill, the, english, desire, to, be, independent, from, continental, europe, religiously, and, politically, as, the, change, was, mostly, political, done, in, order, to, allow, for, the, annulment, of, henry, viii, s, marriage, the, english, church, under, henry, viii, continued, to, maintain, catholic, doctrines, and, liturgical, celebrations, of, the, sacraments, despite, its, separation, from, rome, with, little, exception, henry, viii, allowed, no, changes, during, his, lifetime, under, king, edward, vi, 1547, 1553, however, the, church, in, england, first, began, to, undergo, what, is, known, as, the, english, reformation, in, the, course, of, which, it, acquired, a, number, of, characteristics, that, would, subsequently, become, recognised, as, constituting, its, distinctive, anglican, identity, with, the, elizabethan, settlement, of, 1559, the, protestant, identity, of, the, english, and, irish, churches, was, affirmed, by, means, of, parliamentary, legislation, which, mandated, allegiance, and, loyalty, to, the, english, crown, in, all, their, members, the, elizabethan, church, began, to, develop, distinct, religious, traditions, assimilating, some, of, the, theology, of, reformed, churches, with, the, services, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, which, drew, extensively, on, the, sarum, rite, native, to, england, under, the, leadership, and, organisation, of, a, continuing, episcopate, over, the, years, these, traditions, themselves, came, to, command, adherence, and, loyalty, the, elizabethan, settlement, stopped, the, radical, protestant, tendencies, under, edward, vi, by, combining, the, more, radical, elements, of, the, 1552, prayer, book, with, the, conservative, catholic, 1549, prayer, book, into, the, 1559, book, of, common, prayer, from, then, on, protestantism, was, in, a, state, of, arrested, development, regardless, of, the, attempts, to, detach, the, church, of, england, from, its, idiosyncratic, anchorage, in, the, medieval, past, by, various, groups, which, tried, to, push, it, towards, a, more, reformed, theology, and, governance, in, the, years, 1560, 1660, although, two, important, constitutive, elements, of, what, later, would, emerge, as, anglicanism, were, present, in, 1559, scripture, the, historic, episcopate, the, book, of, common, prayer, the, teachings, of, the, first, four, ecumenical, councils, as, the, yardstick, of, catholicity, the, teaching, of, the, church, fathers, and, catholic, bishops, and, informed, reason, neither, the, laypeople, nor, the, clergy, perceived, themselves, as, anglicans, at, the, beginning, of, elizabeth, i, s, reign, as, there, was, no, such, identity, neither, does, the, term, via, media, appear, until, the, 1627, to, describe, a, church, which, refused, to, identify, itself, definitely, as, catholic, or, protestant, or, as, both, and, had, decided, in, the, end, that, this, is, virtue, rather, than, a, handicap, historical, studies, on, the, period, 1560, 1660, written, before, the, late, 1960s, tended, to, project, the, predominant, conformist, spirituality, and, doctrine, of, the, 1660s, on, the, ecclesiastical, situation, one, hundred, years, before, and, there, was, also, a, tendency, to, take, polemically, binary, partitions, of, reality, claimed, by, contestants, studied, such, as, the, dichotomies, protestant, popish, or, laudian, puritan, at, face, value, since, the, late, 1960s, these, interpretations, have, been, criticised, studies, on, the, subject, written, during, the, last, forty, five, years, have, however, not, reached, any, consensus, on, how, to, interpret, this, period, in, english, church, history, the, extent, to, which, one, or, several, positions, concerning, doctrine, and, spirituality, existed, alongside, the, more, well, known, and, articulate, puritan, movement, and, the, durham, house, party, and, the, exact, extent, of, continental, calvinism, among, the, english, elite, and, among, the, ordinary, churchgoers, from, the, 1560s, to, the, 1620s, are, subjects, of, current, and, ongoing, debate, in, 1662, under, king, charles, ii, a, revised, book, of, common, prayer, was, produced, which, was, acceptable, to, high, churchmen, as, well, as, some, puritans, and, is, still, considered, authoritative, to, this, day, in, so, far, as, anglicans, derived, their, identity, from, both, parliamentary, legislation, and, ecclesiastical, tradition, a, crisis, of, identity, could, result, wherever, secular, and, religious, loyalties, came, into, conflict, and, such, a, crisis, indeed, occurred, in, 1776, with, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, most, of, whose, signatories, were, at, least, nominally, anglican, for, these, american, patriots, even, the, forms, of, anglican, services, were, in, doubt, since, the, prayer, book, rites, of, matins, evensong, and, holy, communion, all, included, specific, prayers, for, the, british, royal, family, consequently, the, conclusion, of, the, war, of, independence, eventually, resulted, in, the, creation, of, two, new, anglican, churches, the, episcopal, church, in, the, united, states, in, those, states, that, had, achieved, independence, and, in, the, 1830s, the, church, of, england, in, canada, became, independent, from, the, church, of, england, in, those, north, american, colonies, which, had, remained, under, british, control, and, to, which, many, loyalist, churchmen, had, migrated, reluctantly, legislation, was, passed, in, the, british, parliament, the, consecration, of, bishops, abroad, act, 1786, to, allow, bishops, to, be, consecrated, for, an, american, church, outside, of, allegiance, to, the, british, crown, since, no, dioceses, had, ever, been, established, in, the, former, american, colonies, both, in, the, united, states, and, in, canada, the, new, anglican, churches, developed, novel, models, of, self, government, collective, decision, making, and, self, supported, financing, that, would, be, consistent, with, separation, of, religious, and, secular, identities, in, the, following, century, two, further, factors, acted, to, accelerate, the, development, of, a, distinct, anglican, identity, from, 1828, and, 1829, dissenters, and, catholics, could, be, elected, to, the, house, of, commons, which, consequently, ceased, to, be, a, body, drawn, purely, from, the, established, churches, of, scotland, england, and, ireland, but, which, nevertheless, over, the, following, ten, years, engaged, in, extensive, reforming, legislation, affecting, the, interests, of, the, english, and, irish, churches, which, by, the, acts, of, union, of, 1800, had, been, reconstituted, as, the, united, church, of, england, and, ireland, the, propriety, of, this, legislation, was, bitterly, contested, by, the, oxford, movement, tractarians, who, in, response, developed, a, vision, of, anglicanism, as, religious, tradition, deriving, ultimately, from, the, ecumenical, councils, of, the, patristic, church, those, within, the, church, of, england, opposed, to, the, tractarians, and, to, their, revived, ritual, practices, introduced, a, stream, of, bills, in, parliament, aimed, to, control, innovations, in, worship, this, only, made, the, dilemma, more, acute, with, consequent, continual, litigation, in, the, secular, and, ecclesiastical, courts, over, the, same, period, anglican, churches, engaged, vigorously, in, christian, missions, resulting, in, the, creation, by, the, end, of, the, century, of, over, ninety, colonial, bishoprics, which, gradually, coalesced, into, new, self, governing, churches, on, the, canadian, and, american, models, however, the, case, of, john, colenso, bishop, of, natal, reinstated, in, 1865, by, the, english, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, over, the, heads, of, the, church, in, south, africa, demonstrated, acutely, that, the, extension, of, episcopacy, had, to, be, accompanied, by, a, recognised, anglican, ecclesiology, of, ecclesiastical, authority, distinct, from, secular, power, consequently, at, the, instigation, of, the, bishops, of, canada, and, south, africa, the, first, lambeth, conference, was, called, in, 1867, to, be, followed, by, further, conferences, in, 1878, and, 1888, and, thereafter, at, ten, year, intervals, the, various, papers, and, declarations, of, successive, lambeth, conferences, have, served, to, frame, the, continued, anglican, debate, on, identity, especially, as, relating, to, the, possibility, of, ecumenical, discussion, with, other, churches, this, ecumenical, aspiration, became, much, more, of, a, possibility, as, other, denominational, groups, rapidly, followed, the, example, of, the, anglican, communion, in, founding, their, own, transnational, alliances, the, alliance, of, reformed, churches, the, ecumenical, methodist, council, the, international, congregational, council, and, the, baptist, world, alliance, anglicanism, was, seen, as, a, middle, way, or, via, media, between, two, branches, of, protestantism, lutheranism, and, reformed, christianity, in, their, rejection, of, absolute, parliamentary, authority, the, tractarians, especially, john, henry, newman, looked, back, to, the, writings, of, 17th, century, anglican, divines, finding, in, these, texts, the, idea, of, the, english, church, as, a, via, media, between, the, protestant, and, catholic, traditions, this, view, was, associated, especially, in, the, writings, of, edward, bouverie, pusey, with, the, theory, of, anglicanism, as, one, of, three, branches, alongside, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, churches, historically, arising, out, of, the, common, tradition, of, the, earliest, ecumenical, councils, newman, himself, subsequently, rejected, his, theory, of, the, via, media, as, essentially, historicist, and, static, and, hence, unable, to, accommodate, any, dynamic, development, within, the, church, nevertheless, the, aspiration, to, ground, anglican, identity, in, the, writings, of, the, 17th, century, divines, and, in, faithfulness, to, the, traditions, of, the, church, fathers, reflects, a, continuing, theme, of, anglican, ecclesiology, most, recently, in, the, writings, of, henry, robert, mcadoo, the, tractarian, formulation, of, the, theory, of, the, via, media, between, protestantism, and, catholicism, was, essentially, a, party, platform, and, not, acceptable, to, anglicans, outside, the, confines, of, the, oxford, movement, however, this, theory, of, the, via, media, was, reworked, in, the, ecclesiological, writings, of, frederick, denison, maurice, in, a, more, dynamic, form, that, became, widely, influential, both, maurice, and, newman, saw, the, church, of, england, of, their, day, as, sorely, deficient, in, faith, but, whereas, newman, had, looked, back, to, a, distant, past, when, the, light, of, faith, might, have, appeared, to, burn, brighter, maurice, looked, forward, to, the, possibility, of, a, brighter, revelation, of, faith, in, the, future, maurice, saw, the, protestant, and, catholic, strands, within, the, church, of, england, as, contrary, but, complementary, both, maintaining, elements, of, the, true, church, but, incomplete, without, the, other, such, that, a, true, catholic, and, evangelical, church, might, come, into, being, by, a, union, of, opposites, central, to, maurice, s, perspective, was, his, belief, that, the, collective, elements, of, family, nation, and, church, represented, a, divine, order, of, structures, through, which, god, unfolds, his, continuing, work, of, creation, hence, for, maurice, the, protestant, tradition, had, maintained, the, elements, of, national, distinction, which, were, amongst, the, marks, of, the, true, universal, church, but, which, had, been, lost, within, contemporary, catholicism, in, the, internationalism, of, centralised, papal, authority, within, the, coming, universal, church, that, maurice, foresaw, national, churches, would, each, maintain, the, six, signs, of, catholicity, baptism, eucharist, the, creeds, scripture, an, episcopal, ministry, and, a, fixed, liturgy, which, could, take, a, variety, of, forms, in, accordance, with, divinely, ordained, distinctions, in, national, characteristics, this, vision, of, a, becoming, universal, church, as, a, congregation, of, autonomous, national, churches, proved, highly, congenial, in, anglican, circles, and, maurice, s, six, signs, were, adapted, to, form, the, chicago, lambeth, quadrilateral, of, 1888, in, the, latter, decades, of, the, 20th, century, maurice, s, theory, and, the, various, strands, of, anglican, thought, that, derived, from, it, have, been, criticised, by, stephen, sykes, who, argues, that, the, terms, protestant, and, catholic, as, used, in, these, approaches, are, synthetic, constructs, denoting, ecclesiastic, identities, unacceptable, to, those, to, whom, the, labels, are, applied, hence, the, catholic, church, does, not, regard, itself, as, a, party, or, strand, within, the, universal, church, but, rather, identifies, itself, as, the, universal, church, moreover, sykes, criticises, the, proposition, implicit, in, theories, of, via, media, that, there, is, no, distinctive, body, of, anglican, doctrines, other, than, those, of, the, universal, church, accusing, this, of, being, an, excuse, not, to, undertake, systematic, doctrine, at, all, contrariwise, sykes, notes, a, high, degree, of, commonality, in, anglican, liturgical, forms, and, in, the, doctrinal, understandings, expressed, within, those, liturgies, he, proposes, that, anglican, identity, might, rather, be, found, within, a, shared, consistent, pattern, of, prescriptive, liturgies, established, and, maintained, through, canon, law, and, embodying, both, a, historic, deposit, of, formal, statements, of, doctrine, and, also, framing, the, regular, reading, and, proclamation, of, scripture, sykes, nevertheless, agrees, with, those, heirs, of, maurice, who, emphasise, the, incompleteness, of, anglicanism, as, a, positive, feature, and, quotes, with, qualified, approval, the, words, of, michael, ramsey, for, while, the, anglican, church, is, vindicated, by, its, place, in, history, with, a, strikingly, balanced, witness, to, gospel, and, church, and, sound, learning, its, greater, vindication, lies, in, its, pointing, through, its, own, history, to, something, of, which, it, is, a, fragment, its, credentials, are, its, incompleteness, with, the, tension, and, the, travail, of, its, soul, it, is, clumsy, and, untidy, it, baffles, neatness, and, logic, for, it, is, not, sent, to, commend, itself, as, the, best, type, of, christianity, but, by, its, very, brokenness, to, point, to, the, universal, church, wherein, all, have, died, the, distinction, between, reformed, and, catholic, and, the, coherence, of, the, two, is, a, matter, of, debate, within, the, anglican, communion, the, oxford, movement, of, the, mid, 19th, century, revived, and, extended, doctrinal, liturgical, and, pastoral, practices, similar, to, those, of, roman, catholicism, this, extends, beyond, the, ceremony, of, high, church, services, to, even, more, theologically, significant, territory, such, as, sacramental, theology, see, anglican, sacraments, while, anglo, catholic, practices, particularly, liturgical, ones, have, become, more, common, within, the, tradition, over, the, last, century, there, are, also, places, where, practices, and, beliefs, resonate, more, closely, with, the, evangelical, movements, of, the, 1730s, see, sydney, anglicanism, for, high, church, anglicans, doctrine,

ecumenical, creeds, such, as, the, lutheran, book, of, concord, for, them, the, earliest, anglican, theological, documents, are, its, prayer, books, which, they, see, as, the, products, of, profound, theological, reflection, compromise, and, synthesis, they, emphasise, the, book, of, common, prayer, as, a, key, expression, of, anglican, doctrine, the, principle, of, looking, to, the, prayer,

anglican, clergy, had, to, formally, subscribe, to, the, articles, today, however, the, articles, are, no, longer, binding, but, are, seen, as, a, historical, document, which, has, played, a, significant, role, in, the, shaping, of, anglican, identity, the, degree, to, which, each, of, the, articles, has, remained, influential, varies, on, the, doctrine, of, justification, for, example,

some, evangelical, anglicans, ascribe, to, the, reformed, emphasis, on, sola, fide, faith, alone, in, their, doctrine, of, justification, see, sydney, anglicanism, still, other, anglicans, adopt, a, nuanced, view, of, justification, taking, elements, from, the, early, church, fathers, catholicism, protestantism, liberal, theology, and, latitudinarian, thought, arguably, the, most, influential, of, the, original, articles, has, been, article, vi, on, the, sufficiency, of, scripture, which, says, that, scripture, containeth, all, things, necessary, to, salvation, so, that, whatsoever, is, not, read, therein, nor, may, be, proved, thereby, is, not, to, be, required, of, any, man, that, it, should, be, believed, as, an, article, of, the, faith, or, be, thought, requisite, or, necessary, to, salvation, this, article, has, informed, anglican, biblical, exegesis, and, hermeneutics, since, earliest, times, anglicans, look, for, authority, in, their, standard, divines, see, below, historically, the, most, influential, of, these, apart, from, cranmer, has, been, the, 16th, century, cleric, and, theologian, richard, hooker, who, after, 1660, was, increasingly, portrayed, as, the, founding, father, of, anglicanism, hooker, s, description, of, anglican, authority, as, being, derived, primarily, from, scripture, informed, by, reason, the, intellect, and, the, experience, of, god, and, tradition, the, practices, and, beliefs, of, the, historical, church, has, influenced, anglican, self, identity, and, doctrinal, reflection, perhaps, more, powerfully, than, any, other, formula, the, analogy, of, the, three, legged, stool, of, scripture, reason, and, tradition, is, often, incorrectly, attributed, to, hooker, rather, hooker, s, description, is, a, hierarchy, of, authority, with, scripture, as, foundational, and, reason, and, tradition, as, vitally, important, but, secondary, authorities, finally, the, extension, of, anglicanism, into, non, english, cultures, the, growing, diversity, of, prayer, books, and, the, increasing, interest, in, ecumenical, dialogue, have, led, to, further, reflection, on, the, parameters, of, anglican, identity, many, anglicans, look, to, the, chicago, lambeth, quadrilateral, of, 1888, as, the, sine, qua, non, of, communal, identity, in, brief, the, quadrilateral, s, four, points, are, the, scriptures, as, containing, all, things, necessary, to, salvation, the, creeds, specifically, the, apostles, and, nicene, creeds, as, the, sufficient, statement, of, christian, faith, the, dominical, sacraments, of, baptism, and, holy, communion, and, the, historic, episcopate, within, the, anglican, tradition, divines, are, clergy, of, the, church, of, england, whose, theological, writings, have, been, considered, standards, for, faith, doctrine, worship, and, spirituality, and, whose, influence, has, permeated, the, anglican, communion, in, varying, degrees, through, the, years, while, there, is, no, authoritative, list, of, these, anglican, divines, there, are, some, whose, names, would, likely, be, found, on, most, lists, those, who, are, commemorated, in, lesser, feasts, of, the, anglican, churches, and, those, whose, works, are, frequently, anthologised, the, corpus, produced, by, anglican, divines, is, diverse, what, they, have, in, common, is, a, commitment, to, the, faith, as, conveyed, by, scripture, and, the, book, of, common, prayer, thus, regarding, prayer, and, theology, in, a, manner, akin, to, that, of, the, apostolic, fathers, on, the, whole, anglican, divines, view, the, via, media, of, anglicanism, not, as, a, compromise, but, as, a, positive, position, witnessing, to, the, universality, of, god, and, god, s, kingdom, working, through, the, fallible, earthly, ecclesia, anglicana, these, theologians, regard, scripture, as, interpreted, through, tradition, and, reason, as, authoritative, in, matters, concerning, salvation, reason, and, tradition, indeed, are, extant, in, and, presupposed, by, scripture, thus, implying, co, operation, between, god, and, humanity, god, and, nature, and, between, the, sacred, and, secular, faith, is, thus, regarded, as, incarnational, and, authority, as, dispersed, amongst, the, early, anglican, divines, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, names, of, thomas, cranmer, john, jewel, matthew, parker, richard, hooker, lancelot, andrewes, and, jeremy, taylor, predominate, the, influential, character, of, hooker, s, of, the, laws, of, ecclesiastical, polity, cannot, be, overestimated, published, in, 1593, and, subsequently, hooker, s, eight, volume, work, is, primarily, a, treatise, on, church, state, relations, but, it, deals, comprehensively, with, issues, of, biblical, interpretation, soteriology, ethics, and, sanctification, throughout, the, work, hooker, makes, clear, that, theology, involves, prayer, and, is, concerned, with, ultimate, issues, and, that, theology, is, relevant, to, the, social, mission, of, the, church, the, 17th, century, saw, the, rise, of, two, important, movements, in, anglicanism, cambridge, platonism, with, its, mystical, understanding, of, reason, as, the, candle, of, the, lord, and, the, evangelical, revival, with, its, emphasis, on, the, personal, experience, of, the, holy, spirit, the, cambridge, platonist, movement, evolved, into, a, school, called, latitudinarianism, which, emphasised, reason, as, the, barometer, of, discernment, and, took, a, stance, of, indifference, towards, doctrinal, and, ecclesiological, differences, the, evangelical, revival, influenced, by, such, figures, as, john, wesley, and, charles, simeon, re, emphasised, the, importance, of, justification, through, faith, and, the, consequent, importance, of, personal, conversion, some, in, this, movement, such, as, wesley, and, george, whitefield, took, the, message, to, the, united, states, influencing, the, first, great, awakening, and, creating, an, anglo, american, movement, called, methodism, that, would, eventually, break, away, structurally, from, the, anglican, churches, after, the, american, revolution, by, the, 19th, century, there, was, a, renewed, interest, in, pre, reformation, english, religious, thought, and, practice, theologians, such, as, john, keble, edward, bouverie, pusey, and, john, henry, newman, had, widespread, influence, in, the, realm, of, polemics, homiletics, and, theological, and, devotional, works, not, least, because, they, largely, repudiated, the, old, high, church, tradition, and, replaced, it, with, a, dynamic, appeal, to, antiquity, which, looked, beyond, the, reformers, and, anglican, formularies, their, work, is, largely, credited, with, the, development, of, the, oxford, movement, which, sought, to, reassert, catholic, identity, and, practice, in, anglicanism, in, contrast, to, this, movement, clergy, such, as, the, bishop, of, liverpool, j, c, ryle, sought, to, uphold, the, distinctly, reformed, identity, of, the, church, of, england, he, was, not, a, servant, of, the, status, quo, but, argued, for, a, lively, religion, which, emphasised, grace, holy, and, charitable, living, and,

phillips, brooks, and, charles, brent, churchmanship, can, be, defined, as, the, manifestation, of, theology, in, the, realms, of, liturgy, piety, and, to, some, extent, spirituality, anglican, diversity, in, this, respect, has, tended, to, reflect, the, diversity, in, the, tradition, s, reformed, and, catholic, identity, different, individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses, and, provinces, may, identify, more, closely, with, one, or, the, other, or, some, mixture, of, the, two, the, range, of, anglican, belief, and, practice, became, particularly, divisive, during, the, 19th, century, when, some, clergy, were, disciplined, and, even, imprisoned, on, charges, of, introducing, illegal, ritual, while, at, the, same, time, others, were, criticised, for, engaging, in, public, worship, services, with, ministers, of, reformed, churches, resistance, to, the, growing, acceptance, and, restoration, of, traditional, catholic, ceremonial, by, the, mainstream, of, anglicanism, ultimately, led, to, the, formation, of, small, breakaway, churches, such, as, the, free, church, of, england, in, england, 1844, and, the, reformed, episcopal, church, in, north, america, 1873, anglo, catholic, and, some, broad, church, anglicans, celebrate, public, liturgy, in, ways, that, understand, worship, to, be, something, very, special, and, of, utmost, importance, vestments, are, worn, by, the, clergy, sung, settings, are, often, used, and, incense, may, be, used, nowadays, in, most, anglican, churches, the, eucharist, is, celebrated, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, usage, of, roman, catholics, and, some, lutherans, though, in, many, churches, more, traditional, pre, vatican, ii, models, of, worship, are, common, e, g, an, eastward, orientation, at, the, altar, whilst, many, anglo, catholics, derive, much, of, their, liturgical, practice, from, that, of, the, pre, reformation, english, church, others, more, closely, follow, traditional, roman, catholic, practices, the, eucharist, may, sometimes, be, celebrated, in, the, form, known, as, high, mass, with, a, priest, deacon, and, subdeacon, usually, actually, a, layman, dressed, in, traditional, vestments, with, incense, and, sanctus, bells, and, prayers, adapted, from, the, roman, missal, or, other, sources, by, the, celebrant, such, churches, may, also, have, forms, of, eucharistic, adoration, such, as, benediction, of, the, blessed, sacrament, in, terms, of, personal, piety, some, anglicans, may, recite, the, rosary, and, angelus, be, involved, in, a, devotional, society, dedicated, to, our, lady, the, blessed, virgin, mary, and, seek, the, intercession, of, the, saints, in, recent, decades, the, prayer, books, of, several, provinces, have, out, of, deference, to, a, greater, agreement, with, eastern, conciliarism, and, a, perceived, greater, respect, accorded, anglicanism, by, eastern, orthodoxy, than, by, roman, catholicism, instituted, a, number, of, historically, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, elements, in, their, liturgies, including, introduction, of, the, trisagion, and, deletion, of, the, filioque, clause, from, the, nicene, creed, for, their, part, those,

emphasise, the, two, dominical, sacraments, of, baptism, and, eucharist, viewing, the, other, five, as, lesser, rites, some, evangelical, anglicans, may, even, tend, to, take, the, inerrancy, of, scripture, literally, adopting, the, view, of, article, vi, that, it, contains, all, things, necessary, to, salvation, in, an, explicit, sense, worship, in, churches, influenced, by, these,

uncommon, to, find, typically, charismatic, postures, music, and, other, themes, evident, during, the, services, of, otherwise, anglo, catholic, or, evangelical, parishes, the, spectrum, of, anglican, beliefs, and, practice, is, too, large, to, be, fit, into, these, labels, many, anglicans, locate, themselves, somewhere, in, the, spectrum, of, the, broad, church, tradition, and, consider, themselves, an, amalgam, of, evangelical, and, catholic, such, anglicans, stress, that, anglicanism, is, the, via, media, middle, way, between, the, two, major, strains, of, western, christianity, and, that, anglicanism, is, like, a, bridge, between, the, two, strains, in, accord, with, its, prevailing, self, identity, as, a, via, media, or, middle, path, of, western, christianity, anglican, sacramental, theology, expresses, elements, in, keeping, with, its, status, as, being, both, a, church, in, the, catholic, tradition, as, well, as, a, reformed, church, with, respect, to, sacramental, theology, the, catholic, heritage, is, perhaps, most, strongly, asserted, in, the, importance, anglicanism, places, on, the, sacraments, as, a, means, of, grace, sanctification, and, salvation, as, expressed, in, the, church, s, liturgy, and, doctrine, of, the, seven, sacraments, all, anglicans, recognise, baptism, and, the, eucharist, as, being, directly, instituted, by, christ, the, other, five, confession, absolution, matrimony, confirmation, holy, orders, also, called, ordination, and, anointing, of, the, sick, also, called, unction, are, regarded, variously, as, full, sacraments, by, anglo, catholics, and, many, high, church, and, some, broad, church, anglicans, but, merely, as, sacramental, rites, by, other, broad, church, and, low, church, anglicans, especially, evangelicals, associated, with, reform, uk, and, the, diocese, of, sydney, anglican, eucharistic, theology, is, divergent, in, practice, reflecting, the, essential, comprehensiveness, of, the, tradition, a, few, low, church, anglicans, take, a, strictly, memorialist, zwinglian, view, of, the, sacrament, in, other, words, they, see, holy, communion, as, a, memorial, to, christ, s, suffering, and, participation, in, the, eucharist, as, both, a, re, enactment, of, the, last, supper, and, a, foreshadowing, of, the, heavenly, banquet, the, fulfilment, of, the, eucharistic, promise, other, low, church, anglicans, believe, in, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, but, deny, that, the, presence, of, christ, is, carnal, or, is, necessarily, localised, in, the, bread, and, wine, despite, explicit, criticism, in, the, thirty, nine, articles, many, high, church, or, anglo, catholic, anglicans, hold, more, or, less, the, catholic, view, of, the, real, presence, as, expressed, in, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, seeing, the, eucharist, as, a, liturgical, representation, of, christ, s, atoning, sacrifice, with, the, elements, actually, transformed, into, christ, s, body, and, blood, the, majority, of, anglicans, however, have, in, common, a, belief, in, the, real, presence, defined, in, one, way, or, another, to, that, extent, they, are, in, the, company, of, the, continental, reformer, martin, luther, and, calvin, rather, than, ulrich, zwingli, the, catechism, of, the, american, bcp, of, 1976, repeats, the, standard, anglican, view, the, outward, and, visible, sign, in, the, eucharist, is, the, bread, and, wine, the, inward, and, spiritual, grace, in, the, holy, communion, is, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, given, to, his, people, and, received, by, faith, without, further, definition, it, should, be, remembered, that, anglicanism, has, no, official, doctrine, on, this, matter, believing, it, is, wiser, to, leave, the, presence, a, mystery, the, faithful, can, believe, privately, whatever, explanation, they, favour, be, it, transubstantiation, consubstantiation, receptionism, or, virtualism, the, two, most, congenial, to, anglicans, for, centuries, until, the, oxford, movement, each, of, which, espouses, belief, in, the, real, presence, in, one, way, or, another, or, memorialism, which, has, never, been, an, option, with, anglicans, a, famous, anglican, aphorism, regarding, christ, s, presence, in, the, sacrament, commonly, misattributed, to, queen, elizabeth, i, is, first, found, in, print, in, a, poem, by, john, donne, he, was, the, word, that, spake, it, he, took, the, bread, and, brake, it, and, what, that, word, did, make, it, i, do, believe, and, take, it, an, anglican, position, on, the, eucharistic, sacrifice, sacrifice, of, the, mass, was, expressed, in, the, response, saepius, officio, of, the, archbishops, of, canterbury, and, york, to, pope, leo, xiii, s, papal, encyclical, apostolicae, curae, viz, that, the, prayer, book, contained, a, strong, sacrificial, theology, later, revisions, of, the, prayer, book, influenced, by, the, scottish, canon, of, 1764, first, adopted, by, the, protestant, episcopal, church, in, 1789, made, this, assertion, quite, evident, we, do, make, and, celebrate, before, thy, divine, majesty, with, these, thy, holy, gifts, which, we, now, offer, unto, thee, the, memorial, thy, son, has, commanded, us, to, make, which, is, repeated, in, the, 1929, english, bcp, and, included, in, such, words, or, others, such, as, present, or, show, forth, in, subsequent, revisions, anglican, and, roman, catholic, representatives, declared, that, they, had, substantial, agreement, on, the, doctrine, of, the, eucharist, in, the, windsor, statement, on, eucharistic, doctrine, by, the, anglican, roman, catholic, international, consultation, 1971, and, the, elucidation, of, the, arcic, windsor, statement, 1979, the, final, response, 1991, to, these, documents, by, the, vatican, made, it, plain, that, it, did, not, consider, the, degree, of, agreement, reached, to, be, satisfactory, in, anglicanism, there, is, a, distinction, between, liturgy, which, is, the, formal, public, and, communal, worship, of, the, church, and, personal, prayer, and, devotion, which, may, be, public, or, private, liturgy, is, regulated, by, the, prayer, books, and, consists, of, the, eucharist, some, call, it, holy, communion, or, mass, the, other, six, sacraments, and, the, daily, offices, such, as, morning, prayer, and, evening, prayer, the, book, of, common, prayer, bcp, is, the, foundational, prayer, book, of, anglicanism, the, original, book, of, 1549, revised, in, 1552, was, one, of, the, instruments, of, the, english, reformation, replacing, the, various, uses, or, rites, in, latin, that, had, been, used, in, different, parts, of, the, country, with, a, single, compact, volume, in, the, language, of, the, people, so, that, now, from, henceforth, all, the, realm, shall, have, but, one, use, suppressed, under, queen, mary, i, it, was, revised, in, 1559, and, then, again, in, 1662, after, the, restoration, of, charles, ii, this, version, was, made, mandatory, in, england, and, wales, by, the, act, of, uniformity, and, was, in, standard, use, until, the, mid, 20th, century, with, british, colonial, expansion, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, anglican, churches, were, planted, around, the, globe, these, churches, at, first, used, and, then, revised, the, book, of, common, prayer, until, they, like, their, parent, church, produced, prayer, books, which, took, into, account, the, developments, in, liturgical, study, and, practice, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, which, come, under, the, general, heading, of, the, liturgical, movement, anglican, worship, services, are, open, to, all, visitors, anglican, worship, originates, principally, in, the, reforms, of, thomas, cranmer, who, aimed, to, create, a, set, order, of, service, like, that, of, the, pre, reformation, church, but, less, complex, in, its, seasonal, variety, and, said, in, english, rather, than, latin, this, use, of, a, set, order, of, service, is, not, unlike, the, catholic, tradition, traditionally, the, pattern, was, that, laid, out, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, although, many, anglican, churches, now, use, a, wide, range, of, modern, service, books, written, in, the, local, language, the, structures, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, are, largely, retained, churches, which, call, themselves, anglican, will, have, identified, themselves, so, because, they, use, some, form, or, variant, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, in, the, shaping, of, their, worship, anglican, worship, however, is, as, diverse, as, anglican, theology, a, contemporary, low, church, service, may, differ, little, from, the, worship, of, many, mainstream, non, anglican, protestant, churches, the, service, is, constructed, around, a, sermon, focused, on, biblical, exposition, and, opened, with, one, or, more, bible, readings, and, closed, by, a, series, of, prayers, both, set, and, extemporised, and, hymns, or, songs, a, high, church, or, anglo, catholic, service, by, contrast, is, usually, a, more, formal, liturgy, celebrated, by, clergy, in, distinctive, vestments, and, may, be, almost, indistinguishable, from, a, roman, catholic, service, often, resembling, the, pre, vatican, ii, tridentine, rite, between, these, extremes, are, a, variety, of, styles, of, worship, often, involving, a, robed, choir, and, the, use, of, the, organ, to, accompany, the, singing, and, to, provide, music, before, and, after, the, service, anglican, churches, tend, to, have, pews, or, chairs, and, it, is, usual, for, the, congregation, to, kneel, for, some, prayers, but, to, stand, for, hymns, and, other, parts, of, the, service, such, as, the, gloria, collect, gospel, reading, creed, and, either, the, preface, or, all, of, the, eucharistic, prayer, anglicans, may, genuflect, or, cross, themselves, in, the, same, way, as, roman, catholics, other, more, traditional, anglicans, tend, to, follow, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, and, retain, the, use, of, the, king, james, bible, this, is, typical, in, many, anglican, cathedrals, and, particularly, in, royal, peculiars, such, as, the, savoy, chapel, and, the, queen, s, chapel, these, anglican, church, services, include, classical, music, instead, of, songs, hymns, from, the, new, english, hymnal, usually, excluding, modern, hymns, such, as, lord, of, the, dance, and, are, generally, non, evangelical, and, formal, in, practice, until, the, mid, 20th, century, the, main, sunday, service, was, typically, morning, prayer, but, the, eucharist, has, once, again, become, the, standard, form, of, sunday, worship, in, most, anglican, churches, this, again, is, similar, to, roman, catholic, practice, other, common, sunday, services, include, an, early, morning, eucharist, without, music, an, abbreviated, eucharist, following, a, service, of, morning, prayer, and, a, service, of, evening, prayer, often, called, evensong, when, sung, usually, celebrated, between, 3, 00, and, 6, 00, pm, the, late, evening, service, of, compline, was, revived, in, parish, use, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, anglican, churches, will, also, have, daily, morning, and, evening, prayer, and, some, have, midweek, or, even, daily, celebration, of, the, eucharist, an, anglican, service, whether, or, not, a, eucharist, will, include, readings, from, the, bible, that, are, generally, taken, from, a, standardised, lectionary, which, provides, for, much, of, the, bible, and, some, passages, from, the, apocrypha, to, be, read, out, loud, in, the, church, over, a, cycle, of, one, two, or, three, years, depending, on, which, eucharistic, and, office, lectionaries, are, used, respectively, the, sermon, or, homily, is, typically, about, ten, to, twenty, minutes, in, length, often, comparably, short, to, sermons, in, evangelical, churches, even, in, the, most, informal, anglican, services, it, is, common, for, set, prayers, such, as, the, weekly, collect, to, be, read, there, are, also, set, forms, for, intercessory, prayer, though, this, is, now, more, often, extemporaneous, in, high, and, anglo, catholic, churches, there, are, generally, prayers, for, the, dead, although, anglican, public, worship, is, usually, ordered, according, to, the, canonically, approved, services, in, practice, many, anglican, churches, use, forms, of, service, outside, these, norms, liberal, churches, may, use, freely, structured, or, experimental, forms, of, worship, including, patterns, borrowed, from, ecumenical, traditions, such, as, those, of, the, taiz, community, or, the, iona, community, anglo, catholic, parishes, might, use, the, modern, roman, catholic, liturgy, of, the, mass, or, more, traditional, forms, such, as, the, tridentine, mass, which, is, translated, into, english, in, the, english, missal, the, anglican, missal, or, less, commonly, the, sarum, rite, catholic, devotions, such, as, the, rosary, angelus, and, benediction, of, the, blessed, sacrament, are, also, common, among, anglo, catholics, only, baptised, persons, are, eligible, to, receive, communion, although, in, many, churches, communion, is, restricted, to, those, who, have, not, only, been, baptised, but, also, confirmed, in, many, anglican, provinces, however, all, baptised, christians, are, now, often, invited, to, receive, communion, and, some, dioceses, have, regularised, a, system, for, admitting, baptised, young, people, to, communion, before, they, are, confirmed, the, discipline, of, fasting, before, communion, is, practised, by, some, anglicans, most, anglican, priests, require, the, presence, of, at, least, one, other, person, for, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, referring, back, to, christ, s, statement, in, matthew, 18, 20, when, two, or, more, are, gathered, in, my, name, i, will, be, in, the, midst, of, them, though, some, anglo, catholic, priests, like, roman, catholic, priests, may, say, private, masses, as, in, the, roman, catholic, church, it, is, a, canonical, requirement, to, use, fermented, wine, for, communion, unlike, in, roman, catholicism, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, are, normally, offered, to, the, congregation, at, a, eucharistic, service, communion, in, both, kinds, this, practice, is, becoming, more, frequent, in, the, roman, catholic, church, as, well, especially, through, the, neocatechumenal, way, in, some, churches, the, sacrament, is, reserved, in, a, tabernacle, or, aumbry, with, a, lighted, candle, or, lamp, nearby, in, anglican, churches, only, a, priest, or, a, bishop, may, be, the, celebrant, at, the, eucharist, all, anglican, prayer, books, contain, offices, for, morning, prayer, matins, and, evening, prayer, evensong, in, the, original, book, of, common, prayer, these, were, derived, from, combinations, of, the, ancient, monastic, offices, of, matins, and, lauds, and, vespers, and, compline, respectively, the, prayer, offices, have, an, important, place, in, anglican, history, prior, to, the, catholic, revival, of, the, 19th, century, which, eventually, restored, the, eucharist, as, the, principal, sunday, liturgy, and, especially, during, the, 18th, century, a, morning, service, combining, matins, the, litany, and, ante, communion, comprised, the, usual, expression, of, common, worship, while, matins, and, evensong, were, sung, daily, in, cathedrals, and, some, collegiate, chapels, this, nurtured, a, tradition, of, distinctive, anglican, chant, applied, to, the, canticles, and, psalms, used, at, the, offices, although, plainsong, is, often, used, as, well, in, some, official, and, many, unofficial, anglican, service, books, these, offices, are, supplemented, by, other, offices, such, as, the, little, hours, of, prime, and, prayer, during, the, day, such, as, terce, sext, none, and, compline, some, anglican, monastic, communities, have, a, daily, office, based, on, that, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, but, with, additional, antiphons, and, canticles, etc, for, specific, days, of, the, week, specific, psalms, etc, see, for, example, order, of, the, holy, cross, and, order, of, st, helena, editors, a, monastic, breviary, wilton, conn, morehouse, barlow, 1976, the, all, saints, sisters, of, the, poor, with, convents, in, catonsville, maryland, and, elsewhere, use, an, elaborated, version, of, the, anglican, daily, office, the, society, of, st, francis, publishes, celebrating, common, prayer, which, has, become, especially, popular, for, use, among, anglicans, in, england, the, united, states, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, some, other, anglican, provinces, the, modern, prayer, books, contain, four, offices, in, addition, most, prayer, books, include, a, section, of, prayers, and, devotions, for, family, use, in, the, us, these, offices, are, further, supplemented, by, an, order, of, worship, for, the, evening, a, prelude, to, or, an, abbreviated, form, of, evensong, partly, derived, from, orthodox, prayers, in, the, united, kingdom, the, publication, of, daily, prayer, the, third, volume, of, common, worship, was, published, in, 2005, it, retains, the, services, for, morning, and, evening, prayer, and, compline, and, includes, a, section, entitled, prayer, during, the, day, a, new, zealand, prayer, book, of, 1989, provides, different, outlines, for, matins, and, evensong, on, each, day, of, the, week, as, well, as, midday, prayer, night, prayer, and, family, prayer, some, anglicans, who, pray, the, office, on, daily, basis, use, the, present, divine, office, of, the, roman, catholic, church, in, many, cities, especially, in, england, anglican, and, roman, catholic, priests, and, lay, people, often, meet, several, times, a, week, to, pray, the, office, in, common, a, small, but, enthusiastic, minority, use, the, anglican, breviary, or, other, translations, and, adaptations, of, the, pre, vatican, ii, roman, rite, and, sarum, rite, along, with, supplemental, material, from, cognate, western, sources, to, provide, such, things, as, a, common, of, octaves, a, common, of, holy, women, and, other, additional, material, others, may, privately, use, idiosyncratic, forms, borrowed, from, a, wide, range, of, christian, traditions, in, the, late, medieval, period, many, english, cathedrals, and, monasteries, had, established, small, choirs, of, trained, lay, clerks, and, boy, choristers, to, perform, polyphonic, settings, of, the, mass, in, their, lady, chapels, although, these, lady, masses, were, discontinued, at, the, reformation, the, associated, musical, tradition, was, maintained, in, the, elizabethan, settlement, through, the, establishment, of, choral, foundations, for, daily, singing, of, the, divine, office, by, expanded, choirs, of, men, and, boys, this, resulted, from, an, explicit, addition, by, elizabeth, herself, to, the, injunctions, accompanying, the, 1559, book, of, common, prayer, that, had, itself, made, no, mention, of, choral, worship, by, which, existing, choral, foundations, and, choir, schools, were, instructed, to, be, continued, and, their, endowments, secured, consequently, some, thirty, four, cathedrals, collegiate, churches, and, royal, chapels, maintained, paid, establishments, of, lay, singing, men, and, choristers, in, the, late, 16th, century, all, save, four, of, these, have, with, interruptions, during, the, commonwealth, and, the, covid, 19, pandemic, continued, daily, choral, prayer, and, praise, to, this, day, in, the, offices, of, matins, and, evensong, in, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, these, choral, establishments, are, specified, as, quires, and, places, where, they, sing, for, nearly, three, centuries, this, round, of, daily, professional, choral, worship, represented, a, tradition, entirely, distinct, from, that, embodied, in, the, intoning, of, parish, clerks, and, the, singing, of, west, gallery, choirs, which, commonly, accompanied, weekly, worship, in, english, parish, churches, in, 1841, the, rebuilt, leeds, parish, church, established, a, surpliced, choir, to, accompany, parish, services, drawing, explicitly, on, the, musical, traditions, of, the, ancient, choral, foundations, over, the, next, century, the, leeds, example, proved, immensely, popular, and, influential, for, choirs, in, cathedrals, parish, churches, and, schools, throughout, the, anglican, communion, more, or, less, extensively, adapted, this, choral, tradition, also, became, the, direct, inspiration, for, robed, choirs, leading, congregational, worship, in, a, wide, range, of, christian, denominations, in, 1719, the, cathedral, choirs, of, gloucester, hereford, and, worcester, combined, to, establish, the, annual, three, choirs, festival, the, precursor, for, the, multitude, of, summer, music, festivals, since, by, the, 20th, century, the, choral, tradition, had, become, for, many, the, most, accessible, face, of, worldwide, anglicanism, especially, as, promoted, through, the, regular, broadcasting, of, choral, evensong, by, the, bbc, and, also, in, the, annual, televising, of, the, festival, of, nine, lessons, and, carols, from, king, s, college, cambridge, composers, closely, concerned, with, this, tradition, include, edward, elgar, ralph, vaughan, williams, gustav, holst, charles, villiers, stanford, and, benjamin, britten, a, number, of, important, 20th, century, works, by, non, anglican, composers, were, originally, commissioned, for, the, anglican, choral, tradition, for, example, the, chichester, psalms, of, leonard, bernstein, and, the, nunc, dimittis, of, arvo, p, rt, contrary, to, popular, misconception, the, british, monarch, is, not, the, constitutional, head, of, the, church, of, england, but, is, in, law, the, church, s, supreme, governor, nor, does, the, monarch, have, any, role, in, provinces, outside, england, the, role, of, the, crown, in, the, church, of, england, is, practically, limited, to, the, appointment, of, bishops, including, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, even, this, role, is, limited, as, the, church, presents, the, government, with, a, short, list, of, candidates, from, which, to, choose, this, process, is, accomplished, through, collaboration, with, and, consent, of, ecclesial, representatives, see, ecclesiastical, commissioners, although, the, monarch, has, no, constitutional, role, in, anglican, churches, in, other, parts, of, the, world, the, prayer, books, of, several, countries, where, the, monarch, is, head, of, state, contain, prayers, for, him, or, her, as, sovereign, a, characteristic, of, anglicanism, is, that, it, has, no, international, juridical, authority, all, forty, two, provinces, of, the, anglican, communion, are, autonomous, each, with, their, own, primate, and, governing, structure, these, provinces, may, take, the, form, of, national, churches, such, as, in, canada, uganda, or, japan, or, a, collection, of, nations, such, as, the, west, indies, central, africa, or, south, asia, or, geographical, regions, such, as, vanuatu, and, solomon, islands, etc, within, these, provinces, there, may, exist, subdivisions, called, ecclesiastical, provinces, under, the, jurisdiction, of, a, metropolitan, archbishop, all, provinces, of, the, anglican, communion, consist, of, dioceses, each, under, the, jurisdiction, of, a, bishop, in, the, anglican, tradition, bishops, must, be, consecrated, according, to, the, strictures, of, apostolic, succession, which, anglicans, consider, one, of, the, marks, of, catholicity, apart, from, bishops, there, are, two, other, orders, of, ordained, ministry, deacon, and, priest, no, requirement, is, made, for, clerical, celibacy, though, many, anglo, catholic, priests, have, traditionally, been, bachelors, because, of, innovations, that, occurred, at, various, points, after, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, women, may, be, ordained, as, deacons, in, almost, all, provinces, as, priests, in, most, and, as, bishops, in, many, anglican, religious, orders, and, communities, suppressed, in, england, during, the, reformation, have, re, emerged, especially, since, the, mid, 19th, century, and, now, have, an, international, presence, and, influence, government, in, the, anglican, communion, is, synodical, consisting, of, three, houses, of, laity, usually, elected, parish, representatives, clergy, and, bishops, national, provincial, and, diocesan, synods, maintain, different, scopes, of, authority, depending, on, their, canons, and, constitutions, anglicanism, is, not, congregational, in, its, polity, it, is, the, diocese, not, the, parish, church, which, is, the, smallest, unit, of, authority, in, the, church, see, episcopal, polity, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, has, a, precedence, of, honour, over, the, other, primates, of, the, anglican, communion, and, for, a, province, to, be, considered, a, part, of, the, communion, means, specifically, to, be, in, full, communion, with, the, see, of, canterbury, though, this, principle, is, currently, subject, to, considerable, debate, especially, among, those, in, the, so, called, global, south, including, american, anglicans, the, archbishop, is, therefore, recognised, as, primus, inter, pares, first, amongst, equals, even, though, he, does, not, exercise, any, direct, authority, in, any, province, outside, england, of, which, he, is, chief, primate, rowan, williams, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, from, 2002, to, 2012, was, the, first, archbishop, appointed, from, outside, the, church, of, england, since, the, reformation, he, was, formerly, the, archbishop, of, wales, as, spiritual, head, of, the, communion, the,

lambeth, conferences, of, anglican, communion, bishops, and, decides, who, will, be, invited, to, them, he, also, hosts, and, chairs, the, anglican, communion, primates, meeting, and, is, responsible,

threefold, ministry, of, deacons, presbyters, usually, called, priests, and, bishops, bishops, who, possess, the, fullness, of, christian, priesthood, are, the, successors, of, the, apostles, primates, archbishops, and, metropolitans, are, all, bishops, and, members, of, the, historical, episcopate, who, derive, their, authority, through, apostolic, succession, an, unbroken, line, of, bishops, that, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 12, apostles, of, jesus, bishops, are, assisted, by, priests, and, deacons, most, ordained, ministers, in, the, anglican, communion, are, priests, who, usually, work, in, parishes, within, a, diocese, priests, are, in, charge, of, the, spiritual, life, of, parishes, and, are, usually, called, the, rector, or, vicar, a, curate, or, more, correctly, an, assistant, curate, is, a, priest, or, deacon, who, assists, the, parish, priest, non, parochial, priests, may, earn, their, living, by, any, vocation, although, employment, by, educational, institutions, or, charitable, organisations, is, most, common, priests, also, serve, as, chaplains, of, hospitals, schools, prisons, and, in, the, armed, forces, an, archdeacon, is, a, priest, or, deacon, responsible, for, administration, of, an, archdeaconry, which, is, often, the, name, given, to, the, principal, subdivisions, of, a, diocese, an, archdeacon, represents, the, diocesan, bishop, in, his, or, her, archdeaconry, in, the, church, of, england, the, position, of, archdeacon, can, only, be, held, by, someone, in, priestly, orders, who, has, been, ordained, for, at, least, six, years, in, some, other, parts, of, the, anglican, communion, the, position, can, also, be, held, by, deacons, in, parts, of, the, anglican, communion, where, women, cannot, be, ordained, as, priests, or, bishops, but, can, be, ordained, as, deacons, the, position, of, archdeacon, is, effectively, the, most, senior, office, to, which, an, ordained, woman, can, be, appointed, a, dean, is, a, priest, who, is, the, principal, cleric, of, a, cathedral, or, other, collegiate, church, and, the, head, of, the, chapter, of, canons, if, the, cathedral, or, collegiate, church, has, its, own, parish, the, dean, is, usually, also, rector, of, the, parish, however, in, the, church, of, ireland, the, roles, are, often, separated, and, most, cathedrals, in, the, church, of, england, do, not, have, associated, parishes, in, the, church, in, wales, however, most, cathedrals, are, parish, churches, and, their, deans, are, now, also, vicars, of, their, parishes, the, anglican, communion, recognises, roman, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, ordinations, as, valid, outside, the, anglican, communion, anglican, ordinations, at, least, of, male, priests, are, recognised, by, the, old, catholic, church, porvoo, communion, lutherans, and, various, independent, catholic, churches, in, anglican, churches, deacons, often, work, directly, in, ministry, to, the, marginalised, inside, and, outside, the, church, the, poor, the, sick, the, hungry, the, imprisoned, unlike, orthodox, and, most, roman, catholic, deacons, who, may, be, married, only, before, ordination, deacons, are, permitted, to, marry, freely, both, before, and, after, ordination, as, are, priests, most, deacons, are, preparing, for, priesthood, and, usually, only, remain, as, deacons, for, about, a, year, before, being, ordained, priests, however, there, are, some, deacons, who, remain, so, many, provinces, of, the, anglican, communion, ordain, both, men, and, women, as, deacons, many, of, those, provinces, that, ordain, women, to, the, priesthood, previously, allowed, them, to, be, ordained, only, to, the, diaconate, the, effect, of, this, was, the, creation, of, a, large, and, overwhelmingly, female, diaconate, for, a, time, as, most, men, proceeded, to, be, ordained, priest, after, a, short, time, as, a, deacon, deacons, in, some, dioceses, can, be, granted, licences, to,

ministry, often, on, a, full, time, and, long, term, basis, such, as, lay, readers, also, known, as, readers, churchwardens, vergers, and, sextons, other, lay, positions, include, acolytes, male, or, female, often, children, lay, eucharistic, ministers, also, known, as, chalice, bearers, and, lay, eucharistic, visitors, who, deliver, consecrated, bread, and, wine, to, shut, ins, or, members, of, the, parish, who, are, unable, to, leave, home, or, hospital, to, attend, the, eucharist, lay, people, also, serve, on, the, parish, altar, guild, preparing, the, altar, and, caring, for, its, candles, linens, flowers, etc, in, the, choir, and, as, cantors, as, ushers, and, greeters, and, on, the, church, council, called, the, vestry, in, some, countries, which, is, the, governing, body, of, a, parish, a, small, yet, influential, aspect, of, anglicanism, is, its, religious, orders, and, communities, shortly, after, the, beginning, of, the, catholic, revival, in, the, church, of, england, there, was, a, renewal, of, interest, in, re, establishing, religious, and, monastic, orders, and, communities, one, of, henry, viii, s, earliest, acts, was, their, dissolution, and, seizure, of, their, assets, in, 1841, marian, rebecca, hughes, became, the, first, woman, to, take, the, vows, of, religion, in, communion, with, the, province, of, canterbury, since, the, reformation, in, 1848, priscilla, lydia, sellon, became, the, superior, of, the, society, of, the, most, holy, trinity, at, devonport, plymouth, the, first, organised, religious, order, sellon, is, called, the, restorer, after, three, centuries, of, the, religious, life, in, the, church, of, england, for, the, next, one, hundred, years, religious, orders, for, both, men, and, women, proliferated, throughout, the, world, becoming, a, numerically, small, but, disproportionately, influential, feature, of, global, anglicanism, anglican, religious, life, at, one, time, boasted, hundreds, of, orders, and, communities, and, thousands, of, religious, an, important, aspect, of, anglican, religious, life, is, that, most, communities, of, both, men, and, women, lived, their, lives, consecrated, to, god, under, the, vows, of, poverty, chastity, and, obedience, or, in, benedictine, communities, stability, conversion, of, life, and, obedience, by, practising, a, mixed, life, of, reciting, the, full, eight, services, of, the, breviary, in, choir, along, with, a, daily, eucharist, plus, service, to, the, poor, the, mixed, life, combining, aspects, of, the, contemplative, orders, and, the, active, orders, remains, to, this, day, a, hallmark, of, anglican, religious, life, another, distinctive, feature, of, anglican, religious, life, is, the, existence, of, some, mixed, gender, communities, since, the, 1960s, there, has, been, a, sharp, decline, in, the, number, of, professed, religious, in, most, parts, of, the, anglican, communion, especially, in, north, america, europe, and, australia, many, once, large, and, international, communities, have, been, reduced, to, a, single, convent, or, monastery, with, memberships, of, elderly, men, or, women, in, the, last, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, novices, have, for, most, communities, been, few, and, far, between, some, orders, and, communities, have, already, become, extinct, there, are, however, still, thousands, of, anglican, religious, working, today, in, approximately, 200, communities, around, the, world, and, religious, life, in, many, parts, of, the, communion, especially, in, developing, nations, flourishes, the, most, significant, growth, has, been, in, the, melanesian, countries, of, the, solomon, islands, vanuatu, and, papua, new, guinea, the, melanesian, brotherhood, founded, at, tabalia, guadalcanal, in, 1925, by, ini, kopuria, is, now, the, largest, anglican, community, in, the, world, with, over, 450, brothers, in, the, solomon, islands, vanuatu, papua, new, guinea, the, philippines, and, the, united, kingdom, the, sisters, of, the, church, started, by, mother, emily, ayckbowm, in, england, in, 1870, has, more, sisters, in, the, solomons, than, all, their, other, communities, the, community, of, the, sisters, of, melanesia, started, in, 1980, by, sister, nesta, tiboe, is, a, growing, community, of, women, in, the, solomon, islands, the, society, of, saint, francis, founded, as, a, union, of, various, franciscan, orders, in, the, 1920s, has, experienced, great, growth, in, the, solomon, islands, other, communities, of, religious, have, been, started, by, anglicans, in, papua, new, guinea, and, in, vanuatu, most, melanesian, anglican, religious, are, in, their, early, to, mid, 20s, vows, may, be, temporary, and, it, is, generally, assumed, that, brothers, at, least, will, leave, and, marry, in, due, course, making, the, average, age, 40, to, 50, years, younger, than, their, brothers, and, sisters, in, other, countries, growth, of, religious,

and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, number, of, anglicans, in, the, world, is, over, 85, million, as, of, 2011, the, 11, provinces, in, africa, saw, growth, in, the, last, two, decades, they, now, include, 36, 7, million, members, more, anglicans, than, there, are, in, england, england, remains, the, largest, single, anglican, province, with, 26, million, members, in, most, industrialised, countries, church, attendance, has, decreased, since, the, 19th, century, anglicanism, s, presence, in, the, rest, of, the, world, is, due, to, large, scale, emigration, the, establishment, of, expatriate, communities, or, the, work, of, missionaries, the, church, of, england, has, been, a, church, of, missionaries, since, the, 17th, century, when, the, church, first, left, english, shores, with, colonists, who, founded, what, would, become, the, united, states, australia, canada, new, zealand, and, south, africa, and, established, anglican, churches, for, example, an, anglican, chaplain, robert, wolfall, with, martin, frobisher, s, arctic, expedition, celebrated, the, eucharist, in, 1578, in, frobisher, bay, the, first, anglican, church, in, the, americas, was, built, at, jamestown, virginia, in, 1607, by, the, 18th, century, missionaries, worked, to, establish, anglican, churches, in, asia, africa, and, latin, america, the, great, church, of, england, missionary, societies, were, founded, for, example, the, society, for, promoting, christian, knowledge, spck, in, 1698, the, society, for, the, propagation, of, the, gospel, in, foreign, parts, spg, in, 1701, and, the, church, mission, society, cms, in, 1799, in, the, 19th, century, social, oriented, evangelism, with, societies, were, founded, and, developed, including, the, church, pastoral, aid, society,

in, the, 20th, century, the, church, of, england, developed, new, forms, of, evangelism, including, the, alpha, course, in, 1990, which, was, developed, and, propagated, from, holy, trinity, brompton, church, in, london, in, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, renewed, effort, to, reach, children, and, youth, fresh, expressions, is, a, church, of, england, missionary, initiative, to, youth, begun, in, 2005, and, has, ministries, at, a, skate, park, through, the, efforts, of, st, george, s, church, benfleet, essex, the, diocese, of, chelmsford, or, youth, groups, with, evocative, names, like, the, c, l, a, w, christ, little, angels, whatever, youth, group, at, coventry, cathedral, for, those, who, prefer, not, to, actually, visit, a, brick, and, mortar, church, there, are, internet, ministries, such, as, the, diocese, of, oxford, s, online, anglican, i, church, which, was, founded, on, the, web, in, 2005, anglican, interest, in, ecumenical, dialogue, can, be, traced, back, to, the, time, of, the, reformation, and, dialogues, with, both, orthodox, and, lutheran, churches, in, the, 16th, century, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, rise, of, the, oxford, movement, there, arose, greater, concern, for, reunion, of, the, churches, of, catholic, confession, this, desire, to, work, towards, full, communion, with, other, denominations, led, to, the, development, of, the, chicago, lambeth, quadrilateral, approved, by, the, third, lambeth, conference, of, 1888, the, four, points, the, sufficiency, of, scripture, the, historic, creeds, the, two, dominical, sacraments, and, the, historic, episcopate, were, proposed, as, a, basis, for, discussion, although, they, have, frequently, been, taken, as, a, non, negotiable, bottom, line, for, any, form, of, reunion, anglicanism, in, general, has, always, sought, a, balance, between, the, emphases, of, catholicism, and, protestantism, while, tolerating, a, range, of, expressions, of, evangelicalism, and, ceremony, clergy, and, laity, from, all, anglican, churchmanship, traditions, have, been, active, in, the, formation, of, the, continuing, movement, while, there, are, high, church, broad, church, and, low, church, continuing, anglicans, many, continuing, churches, are, anglo, catholic, with, highly, ceremonial, liturgical, practices, others, belong, to, a, more, evangelical, or, low, church, tradition, and, tend, to, support, the, thirty, nine, articles, and, simpler, worship, services, morning, prayer, for, instance, is, often, used, instead, of, the, holy, eucharist, for, sunday, worship, services, although, this, is, not, necessarily, true, of, all, low, church, parishes, most, continuing, churches, in, the, united, states, reject, the, 1979, revision, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, by, the, episcopal, church, and, use, the, 1928, version, for, their, services, instead, in, addition, anglo, catholic, bodies, may, use, the, anglican, missal, anglican, service, book, or, english, missal, when, celebrating, mass, a, changing, focus, on, social, issues, after, the, world, war, ii, led, to, lambeth, conference, resolutions, countenancing, contraception, and, the, remarriage, of, divorced, persons, eventually, most, provinces, approved, the, ordination, of, women, in, more, recent, years, some, jurisdictions, have, permitted, the, ordination, of, people, in, same, sex, relationships, and, authorised, rites, for, the, blessing, of, same, sex, unions, see, homosexuality, and, anglicanism, the, more, liberal, provinces, that, are, open, to, changing, church, doctrine, on, marriage, in, order, to, allow, for, same, sex, unions, include, brazil, canada, new, zealand, scotland, south, india, south, africa, the, us, and, wales, while, the, more, conservative, provinces, are, primarily, located, in, the, global, south, the, lack, of, social, consensus, among, and, within, provinces, of, diverse, cultural, traditions, has, resulted, in, considerable, conflict, and, even, schism, concerning, some, or, all, of, these, developments, as, was, the, case, in, the, anglican, realignment, more, conservative, elements, within, and, outside, of, anglicanism, primarily, african, churches, and, factions, within, north, american, anglicanism, have, opposed, these, changes, while, some, liberal, and, moderate, anglicans, see, this, opposition, as, representing, a, new, fundamentalism, within, anglicanism, and, believe, a, split, is, inevitable, and, preferable, to, continued, infighting, and, paralysis, some, anglicans, opposed, to, various, liberalising, changes, in, particular, the, ordination, of, women, have, become, roman, catholics, or, orthodox, others, have, at, various, times, joined, the, continuing, anglican, movement, or, departed, for, non, anglican, evangelical, churches, the, term, continuing, anglicanism, refers, to, a, number, of, church, bodies, which, have, formed, outside, of, the, anglican, communion, in, the, belief, that, traditional, forms, of, anglican, faith, worship, and, order, have, been, unacceptably, revised, or, abandoned, within, some, anglican, communion, churches, in, recent, decades, they, therefore, claim, that, they, are, continuing, traditional, anglicanism, the, modern, continuing, anglican, movement, principally, dates, to, the, congress, of, st, louis, held, in, the, united, states, in, 1977, where, participants, rejected, changes, that, had, been, made, in, the, episcopal, church, s, book, of, common, prayer, and, also, the, episcopal, church, s, approval, of, the, ordination, of, women, to, the, priesthood, more, recent, changes, in, the, north, american, churches, of, the, anglican, communion, such, as, the, introduction, of, same, sex, marriage, rites, and, the, ordination, of, gay, and, lesbian, people, to, the, priesthood, and, episcopate, have, created, further, separations, continuing, churches, have, generally, been, formed, by, people, who, have, left, the, anglican, communion, the, original, anglican, churches, are, charged, by, the, continuing, anglicans, with, being, greatly, compromised, by, secular, cultural, standards, and, liberal, theology, many, continuing, anglicans, believe, that, the, faith, of, some, churches, in, communion, with, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, has, become, unorthodox, and, therefore, have, not, sought, to, also, be, in, communion, with, him, the, original, continuing, parishes, in, the, united, states, were, found, mainly, in, metropolitan, areas, since, the, late, 1990s, a, number, have, appeared, in, smaller, communities, often, as, a, result, of, a, division, in, the, town, s, existing, episcopal, churches, the, 2007, 08, directory, of, traditional, anglican, and, episcopal, parishes, published, by, the, fellowship, of, concerned, churchmen, contained, information, on, over, 900, parishes, affiliated, with, either, the, continuing, anglican, churches, or, the, anglican, realignment, movement, a, more, recent, wave, of, anglicans, withdrawing, from, the, anglican, communion, s, north, american, provinces, a, concern, for, social, justice, can, be, traced, to, very, early, anglican, beliefs, relating, to, an, intertwined, theology, of, god, nature, and, humanity, the, anglican, theologian, richard, hooker, wrote, in, his, book, the, works, of, that, learned, and, judicious, divine, that, god, hath, created, nothing, simply, for, itself, but, each, thing, in, all, things, and, of, every, thing, each, part, in, other, have, such, interest, that, in, the, whole, world, nothing, is, found, whereunto, any, thing, created, can, say, i, need, thee, not, such, statements, demonstrate, a, theological, anglican, interest, in, social, activism, which, has, historically, appeared, in, movements, such, as, evangelical, anglican, william, wilberforce, s, campaign, against, slavery, in, the, 18th, century, or, 19th, century, issues, concerning, industrialisation, lord, shaftesbury, a, devout, evangelical, campaigned, to, improve, the, conditions, in, factories, in, mines, for, chimney, sweeps, and, for, the, education, of, the, very, poor, for, years, he, was, chairman, of, the, ragged, school, board, frederick, denison, maurice, was, a, leading, figure, advocating, reform, founding, so, called, producer, s, co, operatives, and, the, working, men, s, college, his, work, was, instrumental, in, the, establishment, of, the, christian, socialist, movement, although, he, himself, was, not, in, any, real, sense, a, socialist, but, a, tory, paternalist, with, the, unusual, desire, to, theories, his, acceptance, of, the, traditional, obligation, to, help, the, poor, influenced, anglo, catholics, such, as, charles, gore, who, wrote, that, the, principle, of, the, incarnation, is, denied, unless, the, christian, spirit, can, be, allowed, to, concern, itself, with, everything, that, interests, and, touches, human, life, anglican, focus, on, labour, issues, culminated, in, the, work, of, william, temple, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, a, question, of, whether, or, not, christianity, is, a, pacifist, religion, has, remained, a, matter, of, debate, for, anglicans, the, leading, anglican, spokesman, for, pacifist, ideas, from, 1914, to, 1945, was, ernest, barnes, bishop, of, birmingham, from, 1924, to, 1953, he, opposed, both, world, wars, in, 1937, the, anglican, pacifist, fellowship, emerged, as, a, distinct, reform, organisation, seeking, to, make, pacifism, a, clearly, defined, part, of, anglican, theology, the, group, rapidly, gained, popularity, amongst, anglican, intellectuals, including, vera, brittain, evelyn, underhill, and, the, former, british, political, leader, george, lansbury, furthermore, dick, sheppard, who, during, the, 1930s, was, one, of, britain, s, most, famous, anglican, priests, due, to, his, landmark, sermon, broadcasts, for, bbc, radio, founded, the, peace, pledge, union, a, secular, pacifist, organisation, for, the, non, religious, that, gained, considerable, support, throughout, the, 1930s, whilst, never, actively, endorsed, by, anglican, churches, many, anglicans, unofficially, have, adopted, the, augustinian, just, war, doctrine, the, anglican, pacifist, fellowship, remains, highly, active, throughout, the, anglican, world, it, rejects, this, doctrine, of, just, war, and, seeks, to, reform, the, church, by, reintroducing, the, pacifism, inherent, in, the, beliefs, of, many, of, the, earliest, christians, and, present, in, their, interpretation, of, christ, s, sermon, on, the, mount, the, principles, of, the, anglican, pacifist, fellowship, are, often, formulated, as, a, statement, of, belief, that, jesus, teaching, is, incompatible, with, the, waging, of, war, that, a, christian, church, should, never, support, or, justify, war, that, our, christian, witness, should, include, opposing, the, waging, or, justifying, of, war, confusing, the, matter, was, that, the, 37th, article, of, religion, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, states, that, it, is, lawful, for, christian, men, at, the, commandment, of, the, magistrate, to, wear, weapons, and, serve, in, the, wars, therefore, the, lambeth, council, in, the, modern, era, has, sought, to, provide, a, clearer, position, by, repudiating, modern, war, and, developed, a, statement, that, has, been, affirmed, at, each, subsequent, meeting, of, the, council, this, statement, was, strongly, reasserted, when, the, 67th, general, convention, of, the, episcopal, church, reaffirms, the, statement, made, by, the, anglican, bishops, assembled, at, lambeth, in, 1978, and, adopted, by, the, 66th, general, convention, of, the, episcopal, church, in, 1979, calling, christian, people, everywhere, to, engage, themselves, in, non, violent, action, for, justice, and, peace, and, to, support, others, so, engaged, recognising, that, such, action, will, be, controversial, and, may, be, personally, very, costly, this, general, convention, in, obedience, to, this, call, urges, all, members, of, this, church, to, support, by, prayer, and, by, such, other, means, as, they, deem, appropriate, those, who, engaged, in, such, non, violent, action, and, particularly, those, who, suffer, for, conscience, sake, as, a, result, and, be, it, further, resolved, that, this, general, convention, calls, upon, all, members, of, this, church, seriously, to, consider, the, implications, for, their, own, lives, of, this, call, to, resist, war, and, work, for, peace, for, their, own, lives, the, focus, on, other, social, issues, became, increasingly, diffuse, after, world, war, ii, the, growing, independence, and, strength, of, anglican, churches, in, the, global, south, brought, new, emphasis, to, issues, of, global, poverty, the, inequitable, distribution, of, resources, and, the, lingering, effects, of, colonialism, in, this, regard, figures, such, as, desmond, tutu, and, ted, scott, were, instrumental, in, mobilising, anglicans, worldwide, against, the, apartheid, policies, of, south, africa, while, individual, anglicans, and, member, churches, within, the, communion, differ, in, practice, over, the, circumstances, in, which, abortion, should, or, should, not, be, permitted, lambeth, conference, resolutions, have, consistently, held, to, a, conservative, view, on, the, issue, the, 1930, conference, the, first, to, be, held, since, the, initial, legalisation, of, abortion, in, europe, in, russia, in, 1920, stated, the, conference, further, records, its, abhorrence, of, the, sinful, practice, of, abortion, the, 1958, conference, s, family, in, contemporary, society, report, affirmed, the, following, position, on, abortion, and, was, commended, by, the, 1968, conference, in, the, strongest, terms, christians, reject, the, practice, of, induced, abortion, or, infanticide, which, involves, the, killing, of, a, life, already, conceived, as, well, as, a, violation, of, the, personality, of, the, mother, save, at, the, dictate, of, strict, and, undeniable, medical, necessity, the, sacredness, of, life, is, in, christian, eyes, an, absolute, which, should, not, be, violated, the, subsequent, lambeth, conference, in, 1978, made, no, change, to, this, position, and, commended, the, need, for, programmes, at, diocesan, level, involving, both, men, and, women, to, emphasise, the, sacredness, of, all, human, life, the, moral, issues, inherent, in, clinical, abortion, and, the, possible, implications, of, genetic, engineering, in, the, context, of, debates, around, and, proposals, for, the, legalisation, of, euthanasia, and, assisted, suicide, the, 1998, conference, affirmed, that, life, is, god, given, and, has, intrinsic, sanctity, significance, and, worth, on, 4, november, 2009, pope, benedict, xvi, issued, an, apostolic, constitution, anglicanorum, coetibus, to, allow, groups, of, former, anglicans, to, enter, into, full, communion, with, the, roman, catholic, church, as, members, of, personal, ordinariates, 20, october, 2009, announcement, of, the, imminent, constitution, mentioned, today, s, announcement, of, the, apostolic, constitution, is, a, response, by, pope, benedict, xvi, to, a, number, of, requests, over, the, past, few, years, to, the, holy, see, from, groups, of, anglicans, who, wish, to, enter, into, full, visible, communion, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, are, willing, to, declare, that, they, share, a, common, catholic, faith, and, accept, the, petrine, ministry, as, willed, by, christ, for, his, church, pope, benedict, xvi, approved, within, the, apostolic, constitution, a, canonical, structure, that, provides, for, personal, ordinariates, which, will, allow, former, anglicans, to, enter, full, communion, with, the, roman, catholic, church, while, preserving, elements, of, distinctive, anglican, spiritual, patrimony, for, each, personal, ordinariate, the, ordinary, may, be, a, former, anglican, bishop, or, priest, it, was, expected, that, provision, would, be, made, to, allow, the, retention, of, aspects, of, anglican, liturgy, the, most, famous, and, beautiful, legend, of, all, related, to, the, conversion, of, britain, is, of, course, that, of, joseph, of, arimathea, who, is, said, to, have, arrived, in, britain, with, twelve, companions, in, the, year, 63, at, the, bidding, of, the, apostle, philip, according, to, this, legend, joseph, brought, with, him, the, holy, grail, and, built, at, glastonbury, the, first, british, church, celtic, christianity, is, a, phrase, used, with, varying, degrees, of, specificity, to, designate, a, complex, of, features, held, to, have, been, common, to, the, celtic, speaking, countries, in, the, early, middle, ages, doubts, concerning, the, term, s, usefulness, have, repeatedly, been, expressed, however, and, the, majority, of, scholars, consider, it, to, be, problematic, while, there, is, considerable, evidence, for, divergent, irish, and, to, an, even, greater, degree, british, practice, in, matters, of, liturgy, baptism, and, ecclesiastical, administration, the, usages, in, question, seem, only, to, have, characterized, specific, regions, and, not, necessarily, to, have, been, uniformly, present, there, only, the, britons, were, accused, of, practising, a, heterodox, baptism, traces, of, an, archaic, liturgy, in, wales, find, no, counterpart, in, the, eclectic, but, largely, gallican, worship, attested, from, ireland, and, the, superiority, of, abbots, to, bishops, appears, to, have, been, limited, to, some, parts, of, gaelic, sphere, of, influence, it, is, important, to, remember, that, there, was, never, any, such, thing, as, the, celtic, church, it, was, never, an, organized, system, in, the, way, that, we, understand, churches, today, rather, each, celtic, church, was, highly, independent, and, if, there, was, a, relationship, between, any, of, them, the, relationship, tended, to, be, one, of, spiritual, support, through, missionary, endeavour, rather, than, through, any, particular, church, structure, it, is, also, important, to, remember, that, the, celtic, church, life, as, it, emerged, in, fifth, century, ireland, would, be, quite, different, to, that, which, emerged, in, nineteenth, century, hebridean, communities, even, on, the, mainland, the, patterns, of, church, life, would, vary, considerably, from, one, place, to, another, and, from, one, age, to, another
