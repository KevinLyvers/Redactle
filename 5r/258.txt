impersonal, enigmatic, process, of, transformation, ultimately, underlying, reality, the, concept, originates, in, the, chinese, word, pinyin, d, o, wade, giles, tao, 4, although, taoism, has, no, simple, definitions, possible, translations, of, tao, include, way, road, and, technique, taoist, thought, has, informed, the, development, of, various, practices, within, the, taoist, tradition, and, beyond, including, forms, of, meditation, astrology, qigong, feng, shui, and, internal, alchemy, a, common, goal, of, taoist, practice, is, self, cultivation, a, deeper, appreciation, of, the, tao, and, more, harmonious, existence, taoist, ethics, vary, but, generally, emphasize, such, virtues, as, effortless, action, naturalness, simplicity, and, the, three, treasures, of, compassion, frugality, and, humility, the, core, of, taoist, thought, crystallized, during, the, early, warring, states, period, c, 450, c, 300, bce, during, which, the, epigrammatic, tao, te, ching, and, the, anecdotal, zhuangzi, widely, regarded, as, the, fundamental, texts, of, taoist, philosophy, were, largely, composed, they, form, the, core, of, a, body, of, taoist, writings, accrued, over, the, following, centuries, which, was, assembled, by, monks, into, the, daozang, canon, starting, in, the, 5th, century, ce, early, taoism, drew, upon, diverse, influences, including, the, shang, and, zhou, state, religions, naturalism, mohism, confucianism, various, legalist, theories, as, well, as, the, i, ching, and, spring, and, autumn, annals, while, taoism, and, confucianism, often, developed, in, a, manner, informed, by, the, significant, differences, between, the, two, traditions, they, are, not, understood, to, be, incompatible, or, mutually, exclusive, the, relationship, between, taoism, and, buddhism, upon, the, latter, s, introduction, to, china, is, characterized, as, one, of, mutual, influence, with, long, running, discourses, shared, between, taoists, and, buddhists, the, distinct, mahayana, tradition, of, zen, that, emerged, during, the, tang, dynasty, 607, 917, incorporates, many, ideas, from, taoism, many, taoist, denominations, recognize, deities, often, ones, shared, with, other, traditions, which, are, venerated, as, superhuman, figures, exemplifying, taoist, virtues, they, can, be, roughly, divided, into, two, categories, of, gods, and, xian, or, immortals, xian, were, immortal, beings, with, vast, supernatural, powers, also, describing, a, principled, moral, person, since, taoist, thought, is, syncretic, and, deeply, rooted, in, chinese, culture, for, millennia, it, is, often, unclear, which, denominations, should, be, considered, taoist, the, status, of, daoshi, or, taoist, master, is, traditionally, attributed, only, to, clergy, in, taoist, organizations, who, distinguish, between, their, traditions, and, others, in, chinese, folk, religion, though, generally, lacking, motivation, for, strong, hierarchies, taoist, philosophy, has, often, served, as, a, theoretical, foundation, for, politics, warfare, and, taoist, organizations, taoist, secret, societies, precipitated, the, yellow, turban, rebellion, during, the, late, han, dynasty, attempting, to, create, what, has, been, characterized, as, a, taoist, theocracy, today, taoism, is, one, of, five, religious, doctrines, officially, recognized, by, the, chinese, government, also, having, official, status, in, hong, kong, and, macau, it, is, considered, a, major, religion, in, taiwan, and, also, has, significant, populations, of, adherents, throughout, the, sinosphere, and, southeast, asia, in, the, west, taoism, has, taken, on, various, forms, both, those, hewing, to, historical, practice, as, well, as, highly, synthesized, practices, variously, characterized, as, new, religious, movements, taoism, and, daoism, are, alternate, spellings, of, the, same, word, tao, is, in, the, wade, giles, romanization, system, which, until, the, late, 20th, century, was, predominant, in, english, speaking, countries, and, remains, in, use, for, certain, terms, with, strongly, established, spellings, dao, is, the, spelling, in, the, hanyu, pinyin, system, officially, adopted, in, china, in, the, 1950s, which, has, largely, replaced, wade, giles, the, standard, chinese, pronunciation, of, both, romanizations, of, the, character, dao, is, the, same, that, is, da, much, like, the, english, dow, one, authority, calls, the, pronunciation, with, a, t, as, in, tie, to, be, a, mispronunciation, originally, caused, by, the, clumsy, wade, giles, system, which, misled, most, readers, the, word, taoism, is, used, to, translate, two, related, but, distinct, chinese, terms, the, distinction, between, taoism, in, philosophy, and, taoist, religion, is, an, ancient, deeply, rooted, one, taoism, is, a, positive, philosophy, that, aims, for, the, holistic, unification, of, an, individual, s, reality, with, everything, that, is, not, only, real, but, also, valuable, encompassing, both, the, natural, world, and, society, the, earliest, references, to, the, tao, per, se, are, largely, devoid, of, liturgical, or, explicitly, supernatural, character, used, in, contexts, either, of, abstract, metaphysics, or, of, the, ordinary, conditions, required, for, human, flourishing, this, distinction, is, still, understood, in, everyday, contexts, among, chinese, people, and, has, been, echoed, by, modern, scholars, of, chinese, history, and, philosophy, such, as, feng, youlan, and, wing, tsit, chan, use, of, the, term, daojia, dates, to, the, western, han, c, 100, bce, referring, to, the, purported, authors, of, the, emerging, taoist, canon, such, as, lao, dan, and, zhuang, zhou, neither, the, tao, te, ching, and, zhuangzi, themselves, nor, the, early, secondary, sources, written, about, them, put, forward, any, particular, supernatural, ontology, nonetheless, that, religious, taoism, emerged, from, a, synthesis, of, folk, religion, with, philosophical, taoist, precepts, is, clear, the, earlier, naturalistic, was, employed, by, pre, han, and, han, thinkers, and, continued, to, be, used, well, into, the, song, including, among, those, who, explicitly, rejected, cults, both, private, and, state, sanctioned, that, were, often, either, labeled, or, self, identified, as, taoist, however, this, distinction, has, been, challenged, or, rejected, by, some, scholars, of, religion, often, those, from, a, western, or, japanese, background, who, often, use, distinct, interpretive, models, and, techniques, this, point, of, view, characterizes, the, religious, and, philosophical, characteristics, of, the, taoist, tradition, as, being, inseparable, sinologists, such, as, isabelle, robinet, and, livia, kohn, state, that, taoism, has, never, been, a, unified, religion, and, has, constantly, consisted, of, a, combination, of, teachings, based, on, a, variety, of, original, revelations, the, distinction, is, fraught, with, hermeneutic, difficulties, when, attempting, to, categorize, different, schools, sects, and, movements, russell, kirkland, writes, that, most, scholars, who, have, seriously, studied, taoism, both, in, asia, and, in, the, west, have, abandoned, this, simplistic, dichotomy, louis, komjathy, writes, that, this, is, an, untenable, misconception, because, the, association, of, daojia, with, thought, sixiang, and, of, daojiao, with, religion, zongjiao, is, a, modern, chinese, construction, largely, rooted, in, earlier, chinese, literati, european, colonialist, and, protestant, missionary, interpretations, contemporaneous, neo, confucianists, for, example, often, self, identify, as, taoist, without, partaking, in, any, rituals, in, contrast, komjathy, characterizes, taoism, as, a, unified, religious, tradition, characterized, by, complexity, and, diversity, arguing, that, historically, none, of, these, terms, were, understood, according, to, a, bifurcated, philosophy, versus, religion, model, daojia, was, a, taxonomical, category, for, taoist, texts, that, was, eventually, applied, to, taoist, movements, and, priests, in, the, early, medieval, period, meanwhile, daojiao, was, originally, used, to, specifically, distinguish, taoist, tradition, from, buddhism, thus, daojiao, included, daojia, komjathy, notes, that, the, earliest, taoist, texts, also, reveal, a, religious, community, composed, of, master, disciple, lineages, and, therefore, that, taoism, was, a, religious, tradition, from, the, beginning, philosopher, chung, ying, cheng, likewise, views, taoism, as, a, religion, embedded, into, chinese, history, and, tradition, while, also, assuming, many, different, forms, of, philosophy, and, practical, wisdom, chung, ying, cheng, also, noted, that, the, taoist, view, of, heaven, mainly, from, observation, and, meditation, the, teaching, of, can, also, include, the, way, of, heaven, independently, of, human, nature, taoism, is, generally, not, understood, as, a, variant, of, chinese, folk, religion, per, se, while, the, two, umbrella, terms, have, considerable, cultural, overlap, core, themes, of, both, also, diverge, considerably, from, one, another, traditionally, the, chinese, language, does, not, have, terms, defining, lay, people, adhering, to, the, doctrines, or, the, practices, of, taoism, who, fall, instead, within, the, field, of, folk, religion, taoist, in, western, sinology, is, traditionally, used, to, translate, daoshi, taoshih, master, of, the, tao, thus, strictly, defining, the, priests, of, taoism, ordained, clergymen, of, a, taoist, institution, who, represent, taoist, culture, on, a, professional, basis, are, experts, of, taoist, liturgy, and, therefore, can, employ, this, knowledge, and, ritual, skill, for, the, benefit, of, a, community, this, role, of, taoist, priests, reflects, the, definition, of, taoism, as, a, liturgical, framework, for, the, development, of, local, cults, in, other, words, a, scheme, or, structure, for, chinese, religion, proposed, first, by, the, scholar, and, taoist, initiate, kristofer, schipper, in, the, taoist, body, 1986, taoshi, are, comparable, to, the, non, taoist, ritual, masters, of, vernacular, traditions, the, so, called, faism, within, chinese, religion, the, term, d, oji, ot, follower, of, dao, with, the, meaning, of, taoist, as, lay, member, or, believer, of, taoism, is, a, modern, invention, that, goes, back, to, the, introduction, of, the, western, category, of, organized, religion, in, china, in, the, 20th, century, but, it, has, no, significance, for, most, of, chinese, society, in, which, taoism, continues, to, be, an, order, of, the, larger, body, of, chinese, religion, scholars, like, harold, roth, argue, that, early, taoism, was, a, series, of, inner, cultivation, lineages, of, master, disciple, communities, according, to, roth, these, practitioners, emphasized, a, contentless, and, nonconceptual, apophatic, meditation, as, a, way, of, achieving, union, with, the, tao, according, to, louis, komjathy, their, worldview, emphasized, the, dao, as, sacred, and, the, universe, and, each, individual, being, as, a, manifestation, of, the, dao, these, communities, were, also, closely, related, to, and, intermixed, with, the, fangshi, method, master, communities, other, scholars, like, russell, kirkland, argue, that, before, the, han, dynasty, there, were, no, real, taoists, or, taoism, instead, there, were, various, sets, of, behaviors, practices, and, interpretative, frameworks, like, the, ideas, of, the, yijing, yin, yang, thought, as, well, as, mohist, legalist, and, confucian, ideas, which, were, eventually, synthesized, in, the, medieval, era, into, the, first, forms, of, taoism, some, of, the, main, early, taoist, sources, include, the, neiye, the, zhuangzi, and, the, tao, te, ching, the, tao, te, ching, attributed, to, laozi, is, dated, by, scholars, to, sometime, between, the, 4th, and, 6th, century, bce, a, common, tradition, holds, that, laozi, founded, taoism, laozi, s, historicity, is, disputed, with, many, scholars, seeing, him, as, a, legendary, founding, figure, while, taoism, is, often, regarded, in, the, west, as, arising, from, laozi, many, chinese, taoists, claim, that, the, yellow, emperor, formulated, many, of, their, precepts, including, the, quest, for, long, life, traditionally, the, yellow, emperor, s, founding, of, taoism, was, said, to, have, been, because, he, dreamed, of, an, ideal, kingdom, whose, tranquil, inhabitants, lived, in, harmonious, accord, with, the, natural, law, and, possessed, virtues, remarkably, like, those, espoused, by, early, taoism, on, waking, from, his, dream, huangdi, sought, to, bring, about, these, virtues, in, his, own, kingdom, to, ensure, order, and, prosperity, among, the, inhabitants, afterwards, taoism, developed, and, grew, into, two, sects, one, is, zhengyi, taoism, which, mainly, focuses, on, spells, and, the, other, is, quanzhen, taoism, which, mainly, focuses, on, practicing, inner, alchemy, overall, traditional, taoist, thought, content, and, sects, are, varied, reflecting, the, ideal, of, absorbing, everything, inside, and, mixing, everything, outside, early, taoism, drew, on, the, ideas, found, in, the, religion, of, the, shang, dynasty, and, the, zhou, dynasty, such, as, their, use, of, divination, ancestor, worship, and, the, idea, of, heaven, tian, and, its, relationship, to, humanity, according, to, modern, scholars, of, taoism, such, as, kirkland, and, livia, kohn, taoist, philosophy, also, developed, by, drawing, on, numerous, schools, of, thought, from, the, warring, states, period, 4th, to, 3rd, centuries, bce, including, mohism, confucianism, legalist, theorists, like, shen, buhai, and, han, fei, which, speak, of, wu, wei, the, school, of, naturalists, from, which, taoism, draws, its, main, cosmological, ideas, yin, and, yang, and, the, five, phases, and, the, chinese, classics, especially, the, i, ching, and, the, l, shi, chunqiu, meanwhile, isabelle, robinet, identifies, four, components, in, the, emergence, of, taoism, the, teachings, found, in, the, tao, te, ching, and, zhuangzi, techniques, for, achieving, ecstasy, practices, for, achieving, longevity, and, becoming, an, immortal, xian, and, practices, for, exorcism, robinet, states, that, some, elements, of, taoism, may, be, traced, to, prehistoric, folk, religions, in, china, in, particular, many, taoist, practices, drew, from, the, warring, states, era, phenomena, of, the, wu, chinese, shamans, and, the, fangshi, method, masters, which, probably, derived, from, the, archivist, soothsayers, of, antiquity, both, terms, were, used, to, designate, individuals, dedicated, to, magic, medicine, divination, methods, of, longevity, and, to, ecstatic, wanderings, as, well, as, exorcism, the, fangshi, were, philosophically, close, to, the, school, of, naturalists, and, relied, greatly, on, astrological, and, calendrical, speculations, in, their, divinatory, activities, female, shamans, played, an, important, role, in, the, early, taoist, tradition, which, was, particularly, strong, in, the, southern, state, of, chu, early, taoist, movements, developed, their, own, tradition, in, contrast, to, shamanism, while, also, absorbing, shamanic, elements, during, the, early, period, some, taoists, lived, as, hermits, or, recluses, who, did, not, participate, in, political, life, while, others, sought, to, establish, a, harmonious, society, based, on, taoist, principles, zhuang, zhou, c, 370, 290, bce, was, the, most, influential, of, the, taoist, hermits, some, scholars, holds, that, since, he, lived, in, the, south, he, may, have, been, influenced, by, chinese, shamanism, zhuang, zhou, and, his, followers, insisted, they, were, the, heirs, of, ancient, traditions, and, the, ways, of, life, of, by, then, legendary, kingdoms, pre, taoist, philosophers, and, mystics, whose, activities, may, have, influenced, taoism, included, shamans, naturalists, skilled, in, understanding, the, properties, of, plants, and, geology, diviners, early, environmentalists, tribal, chieftains, court, scribes, and, commoner, members, of, governments, members, of, the, nobility, in, chinese, states, and, the, descendants, of, refugee, communities, significant, movements, in, early, taoism, disregarded, the, existence, of, gods, and, many, who, believed, in, gods, thought, they, were, subject, to, the, natural, law, of, the, tao, in, a, similar, nature, to, all, other, life, roughly, contemporaneously, to, the, tao, te, ching, some, believed, the, tao, was, a, force, that, was, the, basis, of, all, existence, and, more, powerful, than, the, gods, while, being, a, god, like, being, that, was, an, ancestor, and, a, mother, goddess, early, taoists, studied, the, natural, world, in, attempts, to, find, what, they, thought, were, supernatural, laws, that, governed, existence, taoists, created, scientific, principles, that, were, the, first, of, their, kind, in, china, and, the, belief, system, has, been, known, to, merge, scientific, philosophical, and, religious, conceits, from, close, to, its, beginning, by, the, han, dynasty, 206, bce, 220, ce, the, various, sources, of, taoism, had, coalesced, into, a, coherent, tradition, of, ritualists, in, the, state, of, shu, modern, sichuan, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, taoism, was, the, han, era, 2nd, century, bce, huang, lao, movement, which, was, an, influential, school, of, thought, at, this, time, the, huainanzi, and, the, taipingjing, are, important, sources, from, this, period, an, unorganized, form, of, taoism, was, popular, in, the, han, dynasty, that, syncretized, many, preexisting, forms, in, multiple, ways, for, different, groups, existed, during, a, rough, span, of, time, throughout, the, 2nd, century, bce, also, during, the, han, the, earliest, extant, commentaries, on, the, tao, te, ching, were, written, the, heshang, gong, commentary, and, the, xiang, er, commentary, the, first, organized, form, of, taoism, was, the, way, of, the, celestial, masters, which, developed, from, the, five, pecks, of, rice, movement, at, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, ce, the, latter, had, been, founded, by, zhang, daoling, who, was, said, to, have, had, a, vision, of, laozi, in, 142, ce, and, claimed, that, the, world, was, coming, to, an, end, zhang, sought, to, teach, people, to, repent, and, prepare, for, the, coming, cataclysm, after, which, they, would, become, the, seeds, of, a, new, era, of, great, peace, it, was, a, mass, movement, in, which, men, and, women, could, act, as, libationers, and, tend, to, the, commoners, a, related, movement, arose, in, shandong, called, the, way, of, great, peace, seeking, to, create, a, new, world, by, replacing, the, han, dynasty, this, movement, led, to, the, yellow, turban, rebellion, and, after, years, of, bloody, war, they, were, crushed, the, celestial, masters, movement, survived, this, period, and, did, not, take, part, in, attempting, to, replace, the, han, as, such, they, grew, and, became, an, influential, religion, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, focusing, on, ritual, confession, and, petition, as, well, as, developing, a, well, organized, religious, structure, the, celestial, masters, school, was, officially, recognized, by, the, warlord, cao, cao, in, 215, ce, legitimizing, cao, cao, s, rise, to, power, in, return, laozi, received, imperial, recognition, as, a, divinity, in, the, mid, 2nd, century, bce, another, important, early, taoist, movement, was, taiqing, great, clarity, which, was, a, tradition, of, external, alchemy, weidan, that, sought, immortality, through, the, concoction, of, elixirs, often, using, toxic, elements, like, cinnabar, lead, mercury, and, realgar, as, well, as, ritual, and, purificatory, practices, after, this, point, taoism, did, not, have, nearly, as, significant, an, effect, on, the, passing, of, law, as, the, syncretic, confucian, legalist, tradition, the, three, kingdoms, period, saw, the, rise, of, the, xuanxue, mysterious, learning, or, deep, wisdom, tradition, which, focused, on, philosophical, inquiry, and, integrated, confucian, teachings, with, taoist, thought, the, movement, included, scholars, like, wang, bi, 226, 249, he, yan, d, 249, xiang, xiu, 223, 300, guo, xiang, d, 312, and, pei, wei, 267, 300, another, later, influential, figure, was, the, 4th, century, alchemist, ge, hong, who, wrote, a, key, taoist, work, on, inner, cultivation, the, baopuzi, master, embracing, simplicity, the, six, dynasties, 316, 589, era, saw, the, rise, of, two, new, taoist, traditions, the, shangqing, and, lingbao, schools, shangqing, was, based, on, a, series, of, revelations, by, gods, and, spirits, to, a, certain, yang, xi, between, 364, and, 370, as, livia, kohn, writes, these, revelations, included, detailed, descriptions, of, the, heavens, as, well, as, specific, methods, of, shamanic, travels, or, ecstatic, excursions, visualizations, and, alchemical, concoctions, the, shangqing, revelations, also, introduced, many, new, taoist, scriptures, similarly, between, 397, and, 402, ge, chaofu, compiled, a, series, of, scriptures, that, later, served, as, the, foundation, of, the, lingbao, school, which, was, most, influential, during, the, later, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, and, focused, on, scriptural, recitation, and, the, use, of, talismans, for, harmony, and, longevity, the, lingbao, school, practiced, purification, rituals, called, purgations, in, which, talismans, were, empowered, lingbao, also, adopted, mahayana, buddhist, elements, according, to, kohn, they, integrated, aspects, of, buddhist, cosmology, worldview, scriptures, and, practices, and, created, a, vast, new, collection, of, taoist, texts, in, close, imitation, of, buddhist, sutras, louis, komjathy, also, notes, that, they, adopted, the, mahayana, buddhist, universalism, in, its, promotion, of, universal, salvation, pudu, during, this, period, louguan, the, first, taoist, monastic, institution, influenced, by, buddhist, monasticism, was, established, in, the, zhongnan, mountains, by, a, local, taoist, master, named, yin, tong, this, tradition, was, called, the, northern, celestial, masters, and, their, main, scripture, was, the, xisheng, jing, scripture, of, western, ascension, during, the, sixth, century, taoists, attempted, to, unify, the, various, traditions, into, one, integrated, taoism, that, could, compete, with, buddhism, and, confucianism, to, do, this, they, adopted, the, schema, known, as, the, three, caverns, first, developed, by, the, scholar, lu, xiujing, 406, 477, based, on, the, three, vehicles, of, buddhism, the, three, caverns, were, perfection, dongzhen, associated, with, the, three, sovereigns, mystery, dongxuan, associated, with, lingbao, and, spirit, dongshen, associated, with, the, supreme, clarity, tradition, lu, xiujing, also, used, this, schema, to, arrange, the, taoist, scriptures, and, taoist, deities, lu, xiujing, worked, to, compile, the, first, edition, of, the, daozang, the, taoist, canon, which, was, published, at, the, behest, of, the, chinese, emperor, thus, according, to, russell, kirkland, in, several, important, senses, it, was, really, lu, hsiu, ching, who, founded, taoism, for, it, was, he, who, first, gained, community, acceptance, for, a, common, canon, of, texts, which, established, the, boundaries, and, contents, of, the, teachings, of, the, tao, tao, chiao, lu, also, reconfigured, the, ritual, activities, of, the, tradition, and, formulated, a, new, set, of, liturgies, which, continue, to, influence, taoist, practice, to, the, present, day, this, period, also, saw, the, development, of, the, three, pure, ones, which, merged, the, high, deities, from, different, taoist, traditions, into, a, common, trinity, that, has, remained, influential, until, today, the, new, integrated, taoism, now, with, a, united, taoist, identity, gained, official, status, in, china, during, the, tang, dynasty, this, tradition, was, termed, daojiao, the, teaching, of, the, tao, the, tang, was, the, height, of, taoist, influence, during, which, taoism, led, by, the, patriarch, of, supreme, clarity, was, the, dominant, religion, in, china, according, to, russell, kirkland, this, new, taoist, synthesis, had, its, main, foundation, in, the, lingbao, school, s, teachings, which, was, appealing, to, all, classes, of, society, and, drew, on, mahayana, buddhism, perhaps, the, most, important, figure, of, the, tang, was, the, court, taoist, and, writer, du, guangting, 850, 933, du, wrote, numerous, works, about, taoist, rituals, history, myth, and, biography, he, also, reorganized, and, edited, the, taotsang, after, a, period, of, war, and, loss, during, the, tang, several,

taoist, who, wrote, various, taoist, works, and, according, to, livia, kohn, had, frequent, meetings, with, senior, masters, ritual, specialists, taoist, poets, and, official, patriarchs, such, as, sima, chengzhen, he, reorganized, imperial, rituals, based, on, taoist, forms, sponsored, taoist, shrines, and, monasteries, and, introduced, a, separate, examination, system, based, on, taoism,

this, time, led, by, figures, like, yang, chengfu, and, sun, lutang, early, proponents, of, tai, chi, quan, like, sun, lutang, claimed, that, tai, chi, was, a, taoist, internal, practice, created, by, the, taoist, immortal, zhang, sanfeng, though, modern, scholars, note, that, this, claim, lacks, credible, historical, evidence, taoism, began, to, recover, during, the, reform, and, opening, up, period, beginning, in, 1979, during, which, mainland, china, experienced, increased, religious, freedom, this, led, to, the, restoration, of, many, temples, and, communities, the, publishing, of,

influenced, practices, like, tai, chi, and, qigong, are, also, popular, around, the, world, its, influence, is, ubiquitous, especially, in, divination, and, magical, practices, as, such, taoism, is, now, a, religion, with, a, global, distribution, taoism, has, been, traditionally, associated, with, northern, china, southern, china, and, western, china, and, originated, from, southern, china, during, the, late, 20th, century, taoism, began, to, spread, to, the, western, world, leading, to, various, forms, of, taoist, communities, in, the, west, with, taoist, publications, websites, meditation, and, tai, chi, centers, and, translations, of, taoist, texts, by, western, scholars, as, well, as, non, specialists, taoist, classics, like, the, tao, te, ching, have, also, become, popular, in, the, new, age, movement, and, in, popular, western, taoism, a, kind, of, popularized, hybrid, spirituality, according, to, louis, komjathy, this, popular, western, taoism, is, associated, with, popular, translations, and, interpretations, of, the, tao, te, ching, and, the, work, of, popular, figures, like, james, legge, alan, watts, john, blofeld, gia, fu, feng, and, bruce, lee, this, popular, spirituality, also, draws, on, chinese, martial, arts, which, are, often, unrelated, to, taoism, proper, american, transcendentalism, 1960s, counterculture, new, age, spirituality, the, perennial, philosophy, and, alternative, medicine, on, the, other, hand, traditionally, minded, taoists, in, the, west, are, often, either, ethnically, chinese, or, generally, assume, some, level, of, sinicization, especially, the, adoption, of, chinese, language, and, culture, this, is, because, for, most, traditional, taoists, the, religion, is, not, seen, as, separate, from, chinese, ethnicity, and, culture, as, such, most, western, convert, taoist, groups, are, led, either, by, chinese, teachers, or, by, teachers, who, studied, with, chinese, teachers, some, prominent, western, taoist, associations, include, associacion, de, taoism, de, espa, a, association, francaise, daoiste, british, daoist, association, daoist, foundation, san, diego, california, american, taoist, and, buddhist, association, new, york, ching, chung, taoist, association, san, francisco, universal, society, of, the, integral, way, ni, hua, ching, and, sociedade, taoista, do, brasil, particularly, popular, in, the, west, are, groups, that, focus, on, internal, martial, arts, like, taijiquan, as, well, as, qigong, and, meditation, a, smaller, set, of, groups, also, focus, around, internal, alchemy, such, as, mantak, chia, s, healing, tao, while, traditional, taoism, initially, arrived, in, the, west, through, chinese, immigrants, more, recently, western, run, taoist, temples, have, also, appeared, such, as, the, taoist, sanctuary, in, san, diego, and, the, dayuan, circle, in, san, francisco, kohn, notes, that, all, of, these, centers, combine, traditional, ritual, services, with, tao, te, ching, and, yijing, philosophy, as, well, as, with, various, health, practices, such, as, breathing, diet, meditation, qigong, and, soft, martial, arts, tao, or, dao, can, mean, way, road, channel, path, doctrine, or, line, the, tao, is, a, natural, order, that, enables, all, things, to, exist, and, dominate, every, action, not, so, much, through, force, as, through, a, natural, curvature, of, space, and, time, it, is, the, origin, and, power, of, all, creation, its, essence, is, unknown, but, it, can, be, observed, in, its, manifestation, this, is, behind, the, operation, and, change, of, nature, livia, kohn, describes, the, tao, as, the, underlying, cosmic, power, which, creates, the, universe, supports, culture, and, the, state, saves, the, good, and, punishes, the, wicked, literally, the, way, tao, refers, to, the, way, things, develop, naturally, the, way, nature, moves, along, and, living, beings, grow, and, decline, in, accordance, with, cosmic, laws, the, tao, is, ultimately, indescribable, and, transcends, all, analysis, and, definition, thus, the, tao, te, ching, begins, with, the, tao, that, can, be, told, is, not, eternal, tao, likewise, louis, komjathy, writes, that, the, tao, has, been, described, by, taoists, as, dark, xuan, indistinct, hu, obscure, huang, and, silent, mo, according, to, komjathy, the, tao, has, four, primary, characteristics, 1, source, of, all, existence, 2, unnamable, mystery, 3, all, pervading, sacred, presence, and, 4, universe, as, cosmological, process, as, such, taoist, thought, can, be, seen, as, monistic, the, tao, is, one, reality, panenhenic, seeing, nature, as, sacred, and, panentheistic, the, tao, is, both, the, sacred, world, and, what, is, beyond, it, immanent, and, transcendent, similarly, wing, tsit, chan, describes, the, tao, as, an, ontological, ground, and, as, the, one, which, is, natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and, indescribable, it, is, at, once, the, beginning, of, all, things, and, the, way, in, which, all, things, pursue, their, course, the, tao, is, thus, an, organic, order, which, is, not, a, willful, or, self, conscious, creator, but, an, infinite, and, boundless, natural, pattern, furthermore, the, tao, is, something, that, individuals, can, find, immanent, in, themselves, as, well, as, in, natural, and, social, patterns, thus, the, tao, is, also, the, innate, nature, xing, of, all, people, a, nature, which, is, seen, by, taoists, as, being, ultimately, good, in, a, naturalistic, sense, the, tao, as, visible, pattern, the, tao, that, can, be, told, that, is, the, rhythmic, processes, and, patterns, of, the, natural, world, that, can, be, observed, and, described, thus, kohn, writes, that, tao, can, be, explained, as, twofold, the, transcendent, ineffable, mysterious, tao, and, the, natural, visible, and, tangible, tao, dao, is, a, process, of, reality, itself, a, way, for, things, to, gather, together, while, still, changing, all, of, these, reflect, the, deep, rooted, belief, of, the, chinese, people, that, change, is, the, most, fundamental, characteristic, of, things, in, the, book, of, changes, this, pattern, of, change, is, symbolized, by, numbers, representing, 64, related, force, relationships, known, as, hexagrams, dao, is, the, change, of, these, forces, usually, simply, referred, to, as, yin, and, yang, throughout, taoist, history, taoists, have, developed, different, metaphysical, views, regarding, the, tao, for, example, while, the, xuanxue, thinker, wang, bi, described, tao, as, w, nothingness, negativity, not, being, guo, xiang, rejected, w, as, the, source, and, held, that, instead, the, true, source, was, spontaneous, self, production, z, sh, ng, and, self, transformation, z, hu, another, school, the, ch, ngxu, n, twofold, mystery, developed, a, metaphysics, influenced, by, buddhist, madhyamaka, philosophy, the, active, expression, of, tao, is, called, de, d, also, spelled, te, or, teh, often, translated, with, virtue, or, power, in, a, sense, that, de, results, from, an, individual, living, and, cultivating, the, tao, the, term, de, can, be, used, to, refer, to, ethical, virtue, in, the, conventional, confucian, sense, as, well, as, to, a, higher, spontaneous, kind, of, sagely, virtue, or, power, that, comes, from, following, the, tao, and, practicing, wu, wei, thus, it, is, a, natural, expression, of, the, tao, s, power, and, not, anything, like, conventional, morality, louis, komjathy, describes, de, as, the, manifestation, of, one, s, connection, to, the, tao, which, is, a, beneficial, influence, of, one, s, cosmological, attunement, ziran, z, r, n, tzu, jan, lit, self, so, self, organization, is, regarded, as, a, central, concept, and, value, in, taoism, and, as, a, way, of, flowing, with, the, tao, it, describes, the, primordial, state, of, all, things, as, well, as, a, basic, character, of, the, tao, and, is, usually, associated, with, spontaneity, and, creativity, according, to, kohn, in, the, zhuangzi, ziran, refers, to, the, fact, that, there, is, thus, no, ultimate, cause, to, make, things, what, they, are, the, universe, exists, by, itself, and, of, itself, it, is, existence, just, as, it, is, nothing, can, be, added, or, substracted, from, it, it, is, entirely, sufficient, upon, itself, to, attain, naturalness, one, has, to, identify, with, the, tao, and, flow, with, its, natural, rhythms, as, expressed, in, oneself, this, involves, freeing, oneself, from, selfishness, and, desire, and, appreciating, simplicity, it, also, involves, understanding, one, s, nature, and, living, in, accordance, with, it, without, trying, to, be, something, one, is, not, or, overthinking, one, s, experience, one, way, of, cultivating, ziran, found, in, the, zhuangzi, is, to, practice, the, fasting, of, the, mind, a, kind, of, taoist, meditation, in, which, one, empties, the, mind, it, is, held, that, this, can, also, activate, qi, vital, energy, in, some, passages, found, in, the, zhuangzi, and, in, the, tao, te, ching, naturalness, is, also, associated, with, rejection, of, the, state, anarchism, and, a, desire, to, return, to, simpler, pre, technological, times, primitivism, an, often, cited, metaphor, for, naturalness, is, pu, p, p, p, u, uncut, wood, the, uncarved, log, which, represents, the, original, nature, prior, to, the, imprint, of, culture, of, an, individual, it, is, usually, referred, to, as, a, state, one, may, return, to, the, term, wu, wei, constitutes, the, leading, ethical, concept, in, taoism, wei, refers, to, any, intentional, or, deliberated, action, while, wu, carries, the, meaning, of, there, is, no, or, lacking, without, common, translations, are, nonaction, effortless, action, action, without, intent, noninterference, and, nonintervention, the, meaning, is, sometimes, emphasized, by, using, the, paradoxical, expression, wei, wu, wei, action, without, action, kohn, writes, that, wuwei, refers, to, letting, go, of, egoistic, concerns, and, to, abstain, from, forceful, and, interfering, measures, that, cause, tensions, and, disruption, in, favor, of, gentleness, adaptation, and, ease, in, ancient, taoist, texts, wu, wei, is, associated, with, water, through, its, yielding, nature, and, the, effortless, way, it, flows, around, obstacles, taoist, philosophy, in, accordance, with, the, i, ching, proposes, that, the, universe, works, harmoniously, according, to, its, own, ways, when, someone, exerts, their, will, against, the, world, in, a, manner, that, is, out, of, rhythm, with, the, cycles, of, change, they, may, disrupt, that, harmony, and, unintended, consequences, may, more, likely, result, rather, than, the, willed, outcome, thus, the, tao, te, ching, says, act, of, things, and, you, will, ruin, them, grasp, for, things, and, you, will, lose, them, therefore, the, sage, acts, with, inaction, and, has, no, ruin, lets, go, of, grasping, and, has, no, loss, taoism, does, not, identify, one, s, will, as, the, root, problem, rather, it, asserts, that, one, must, place, their, will, in, harmony, with, the, natural, way, of, the, universe, thus, a, potentially, harmful, interference, may, be, avoided, and, in, this, way, goals, can, be, achieved, effortlessly, by, wu, wei, the, sage, seeks, to, come, into, harmony, with, the, great, tao, which, itself, accomplishes, by, nonaction, the, taoist, view, of, the, self, is, a, holistic, one, that, rejects, the, idea, of, a, separate, individualized, self, as, russell, kirkland, writes, taoists, generally, assume, that, one, s, self, cannot, be, understood, or, fulfilled, without, reference, to, other, persons, and, to, the, broader, set, of, realities, in, which, all, persons, are, naturally, and, properly, embedded, in, taoism, one, s, innate, or, fundamental, nature, xing, is, ultimately, the, tao, expressing, or, manifesting, itself, as, an, embodied, person, innate, nature, is, connected, with, one, s, heartmind, xin, which, refers, to, consciousness, the, heart, and, one, s, spirit, the, focus, of, taoist, psychology, is, the, heartmind, xin, the, intellectual, and, emotional, center, zhong, of, a, person, it, is, associated, with, the, chest, cavity, the, physical, heart, as, well, as, with, emotions, thoughts, consciousness, and, the, storehouse, of, spirit, shen, when, the, heartmind, is, unstable, and, separated, from, the, tao, it, is, called, the, ordinary, heartmind, suxin, on, the, other, hand, the, original, heartmind, benxin, pervades, tao, and, is, constant, and, peaceful, the, neiye, ch, 14, calls, this, pure, original, heartmind, the, inner, heartmind, an, awareness, that, precedes, language, and, a, lodging, place, of, the, numinous, later, taoist, sources, also, refer, to, it, by, other, terms, like, awakened, nature, wuxing, original, nature, benxing, original, spirit, yuanshen, and, scarlet, palace, this, pure, heartmind, is, seen, as, being, characterized, by, clarity, and, stillness, qingjing, purity, pure, yang, spiritual, insight, and, emptiness, taoists, see, life, sheng, as, an, expression, of, the, tao, the, tao, is, seen, as, granting, each, person, a, ming, life, destiny, which, is, one, s, corporeal, existence, one, s, body, and, vitality, generally, speaking, taoist, cultivation, seeks, a, holistic, psychosomatic, form, of, training, that, is, described, as, dual, cultivation, of, innate, nature, and, life, destiny, xingming, shuanxiu, taoism, believes, in, a, pervasive, spirit, world, that, is, both, interlocked, with, and, separate, from, the, world, of, humans, the, cultivation, of, innate, nature, is, often, associated, with, the, practice, of, stillness, jinggong, or, quiet, meditation, while, the, cultivation, of, life, destiny, generally, revolves, around, movement, based, practices, dongong, like, daoyin, and, health, and, longevity, practices, yangsheng, many, taoist, practices, work, with, ancient, chinese, understandings, of, the, body, its, organs, and, parts, elixir, fields, dantien, inner, substances, such, as, essence, or, jing, animating, forces, like, the, hun, and, po, and, meridians, qi, channels, the, complex, taoist, schema, of, the, body, and, its, subtle, body, components, contains, many, parallels, with, traditional, chinese, medicine, and, is, used, for, health, practices, as, well, as, for, somatic, and, spiritual, transformation, through, neidan, psychosomatic, transmutation, or, internal, alchemy, taoist, physical, cultivation, rely, on, purifying, and, transforming, the, body, s, qi, vital, breath, energy, in, various, ways, such, as, dieting, and, meditation, according, to, livia, kohn, qi, is, the, cosmic, energy, that, pervades, all, the, concrete, aspect, of, tao, qi, is, the, material, force, of, the, universe, the, basic, stuff, of, nature, according, to, the, zhuangzi, human, life, is, the, accumulation, of, qi, death, is, its, dispersal, everyone, has, some, amount, of, qi, and, can, gain, and, lose, qi, in, various, ways, therefore, taoists, hold, that, through, various, qi, cultivation, methods, they, can, harmonize, their, qi, and, thus, improve, health, and, longevity, and, even, attain, magic, powers, social, harmony, and, immortality, the, neiye, inward, training, is, one, of, the, earliest, texts, that, teach, qi, cultivation, methods, qi, is, one, of, the, three, treasures, which, is, a, specifically, taoist, schema, of, the, main, elements, in, taoist, physical, practices, like, qigong, and, neidan, the, three, are, jing, essence, the, foundation, for, one, s, vitality, qi, and, sh, n, spirit, subtle, consciousness, a, capacity, to, connect, with, the, subtle, spiritual, reality, these, three, are, further, associated, with, the, three, elixir, fields, dantien, and, the, organs, in, different, ways, the, body, in, taoist, political, philosophy, was, important, and, their, differing, views, on, it, and, humanity, s, place,

revered, and, respect, for, the, dead, as, irrelevant, and, others, within, groups, that, followed, these, beliefs, viewed, almost, all, traditions, as, worthless, daoist, ethics, tends, to, emphasize, various, themes, from, the, taoist, classics, such, as, naturalness, pu, spontaneity, ziran, simplicity, detachment, from, desires, and, most, important, of, all, wu, wei, the, classic, daoist, view, is, that, humans, are, originally, and, naturally, aligned, with, tao, thus, their, original, nature, is, inherently, good, it, emphasizes, doing, things, that, are, natural, following, the, tao, which, is, a, cosmic, force, that, flows, through, all, things, and, binds, and, releases, them, however, one, can, fall, away, from, this, due, to, personal, habits, desires, and, social, conditions, returning, to, one, s, nature, requires, active, attunement, through, daoist, practice, and, ethical, cultivation, some, popular, daoist, beliefs, such, as, the, early, shangqing, school, do, not, believe, this, and, believe, that, some, people, are, irredeemably, evil, and, destined, to, be, so, many, taoist, movements, from, around, the, time, buddhist, elements, started, being, syncretized, with, daoism, had, an, extremely, negative, view, of, foreigners, referring, to, them, as, yi, or, barbarians, and, some, of, these, thought, of, foreigners, as, people, who, do, not, feel, human, feelings, and, who, never, live, out, the, correct, norms, of, conduct, until, they, became, taoist, at, this, time, china, was, widely, viewed, by, taoists, as, a, holy, land, because, of, influence, from, the, chinese, public, that, viewed, being, born, in, china, as, a, privilege, and, that, outsiders, were, enemies, preserving, a, sense, of, chineseness, in, the, country, and, rewarding, nativist, policies, such, as, the, building, of, the, great, wall, of, china, was, important, to, many, taoist, groups, foreigners, who, joined, these, taoist, sects, were, made, to, repent, for, their, sins, in, another, life, that, caused, them, to, be, born, in, the, frontier, wilds, because, of, buddhist, ideas, of, reincarnation, coming, into, their, doctrines, some, daoist, movements, viewed, human, nature, neutrally, however, some, of, the, movements, that, were, dour, or, skeptical, about, human, nature, did, not, believe, that, evil, is, permanent, and, believed, that, evil, people, can, become, good, korean, daoists, tended, to, think, extremely, positively, of, human, nature, some, of, the, most, important, virtues, in, taoism, are, the, three, treasures, or, three, jewels, s, nb, o, these, are, ci, c, usually, translated, as, compassion, jian, ji, n, usually, translated, as, moderation, and, bugan, wei, tianxia, xian, b, g, n, w, i, ti, nxi, xi, n,

aggressive, war, and, capital, punishment, absolute, simplicity, of, living, and, refusal, to, assert, active, authority, taoism, also, adopted, the, buddhist, doctrines, of, karma, and, reincarnation, into, its, religious, ethical, system, medieval, taoist, thought, developed, the, idea, that, ethics, was, overseen, by, a, celestial, administration, that, kept, records, of, people, s, actions, and, their, fate, as, well, as, handed, out, rewards, and, punishments, through, particular, celestial, administrators, in, its, original, form, the, religion, does, not, involve, political, affairs, or, complex, rituals, on, the, contrary, it, encourages, the, avoidance, of, public, responsibility, and, the, search, for, a, vision, of, a, spiritual, transcendent, world, taoists, have, different, religious, goals, that, include, taoist, conceptions, of, sagehood, zhenren, spiritual, self, cultivation, a, happy, afterlife, or, longevity, and, some, form, of, immortality, xian, variously, understood, as, a, kind, of, transcendent, post, mortem, state, of, the, spirit, taoists, views, about, what, happens, in, the, afterlife, tend, to, include, the, soul, becoming, a, part, of, the, cosmos, which, was, often, thought, of, as, an, illusionary, place, where, qi, and, physical, matter, were, thought, of, as, being, the, same, in, a, way, held, together, by, the, microcosm, of, the, spirits, of, the, human, body, and, the, macrocosm, of, the, universe, itself, represented, and, embodied, by, the, three, pure, ones, somehow, aiding, the, spiritual, functions, of, nature, or, tian, after, death, or, being, saved, by, either, achieving, spiritual, immortality, in, an, afterlife, or, becoming, a, xian, who, can, appear, in, the, human, world, at, will, but, normally, lives, in, another, plane, acred, forests, and, mountains, or, a, yin, yang, yin, yang, or, tao, realm, inconceivable, and, incomprehensible, by, normal, humans, and, even, the, virtuous, confucius, and, confucianists, such, as, the, mental, realm, sometimes, called, the, heavens, where, higher, spiritual, versions, of, daoists, such, as, laozi, were, thought, to, exist, when, they, were, alive, and, absorb, the, purest, yin, and, yang, were, all, possibilities, for, a, potential, xian, to, be, reborn, in, these, spiritual, versions, were, thought, to, be, abstract, beings, that, can, manifest, in, that, world, as, mythical, beings, such, as, xian, dragons, who, eat, yin, and, yang, energy, and, ride, clouds, and, their, qi, more, specifically, possibilities, for, the, spirit, of, the, body, include, join, the, universe, after, death, exploring, or, serving, various, functions, in, parts, of, ti, n, or, other, spiritual, worlds, or, becoming, a, xian, who, can, do, one, or, more, of, those, things, taoist, xian, are, often, seen, as, being, eternally, young, because, of, their, life, being, totally, at, one, with, the, tao, of, nature, they, are, also, often, seen, as, being, made, up, of, pure, breath, and, light, and, as, being, able, to, shapeshift, and, some, taoists, believed, their, afterlife, natural, paradises, were, palaces, of, heaven, taoists, who, sought, to, become, one, of, the, many, different, types, of, immortals, such, as, xian, or, zhenren, wanted, to, ensure, complete, physical, and, spiritual, immortality, in, the, quanzhen, school, of, wang, chongyang, the, goal, is, to, become, a, sage, which, he, equates, with, being, a, spiritual, immortal, shen, xien, and, with, the, attainment, of, clarity, and, stillness, qingjing, through, the, integration, of, inner, nature, xing, and, worldly, reality, ming, those, who, know, the, tao, who, flow, with, the, natural, way, of, the, tao, and, thus, embody, the, patterns, of, the, tao, are, called, sages, or, perfected, persons, zhenren, this, is, what, is, often, considered, salvation, in, taoist, soteriology, they, often, are, depicted, as, living, simple, lives, as, craftsmen, or, hermits, in, other, cases, they, are, depicted, as, the, ideal, rulers, which, practice, ruling, through, non, intervention, and, under, which, nations, prosper, peacefully, sages, are, the, highest, humans, mediators, between, heaven, and, earth, and, the, best, guides, on, the, taoist, path, they, act, naturally, and, simply, with, a, pure, mind, and, with, wuwei, they, may, have, supernatural, powers, and, bring, good, fortune, and, peace, some, sages, are, also, considered, to, have, become, one, of, the, immortals, xian, through, their, mastery, of, the, tao, after, shedding, their, mortal, form, spiritual, immortals, may, have, many, superhuman, abilities, like, flight, and, are, often, said, to, live, in, heavenly, realms, the, sages, as, thus, because, they, have, attained, the, primary, goal, of, taoism, a, union, with, the, tao, and, harmonization, or, alignment, with, its, patterns, and, flows, this, experience, is, one, of, being, attuned, to, the, tao, and, to, our, own, original, nature, which, already, has, a, natural, capacity, for, resonance, ganying, with, tao, this, is, the, main, goal, that, all, daoist, practices, are, aiming, towards, and, can, be, felt, in, various, ways, such, as, a, sense, of, psychosomatic, vitality, and, aliveness, as, well, as, stillness, and, a, true, joy, zhenle, or, celestial, joy, that, remains, unaffected, by, mundane, concerns, like, gain, and, loss, the, taoist, quest, for, immortality, was, inspired, by, confucian, emphasis, on, filial, piety, and, how, worshipped, ancestors, were, thought, to, exist, after, death, becoming, an, immortal, through, the, power, of, yin, yang, and, heaven, but, also, specifically, taoist, interpretations, of, the, tao, was, sometimes, thought, of, as, possible, in, chinese, folk, religion, and, taoist, thoughts, on, immortality, were, sometimes, drawn, from, confucian, views, on, heaven, and, its, status, as, an, afterlife, that, permeates, the, mortal, world, as, well, taoist, cosmology, is, cyclic, the, universe, is, seen, as, being, in, constant, change, with, various, forces, and, energies, qi, affecting, each, other, in, different, complex, patterns, taoist, cosmology, shares, similar, views, with, the, school, of, naturalists, taoist, cosmology, focuses, on, the, impersonal, transformations, zaohua, of, the, universe, which, are, spontaneous, and, unguided, livia, kohn, explains, the, basic, taoist, cosmological, theory, as, the, root, of, creation, tao, rested, in, deep, chaos, ch, 42, next, it, evolved, into, the, one, a, concentrated, state, cosmic, unity, that, is, full, of, creative, potential, and, often, described, in, i, ching, terms, as, the, taiji, the, one, then, brought, forth, the, two, the, two, energies, yin, and, yang, which, in, turn, merged, in, harmony, to, create, the, next, level, of, existence, the, three, yin, yang, combined, from, which, the, myriad, beings, came, forth, from, original, oneness, the, world, thus, continued, to, move, into, ever, greater, states, of, distinction, and, differentiation, the, main, distinction, in, taoist, cosmology, is, that, between, yin, and, yang, which, applies, to, various, sets, of, complementary, ideas, bright, dark, light, heavy, soft, hard, strong, weak, above, below, ruler, minister, male, female, and, so, on, cosmically, these, two, forces, exist, in, mutual, harmony, and, interdependence, yin, and, yang, are, further, divided, into, five, phases, wu, xing, or, five, materials, minor, yang, major, yang, yin, yang, minor, yin, major, yin, each, of, these, correlates, with, a, specific, substance, wood, fire, earth, metal, and, water, respectively, this, schema, is, used, in, many, different, ways, in, taoist, thought, and, practice, from, nourishing, life, yangsheng, and, medicine, to, astrology, and, divination, taoists, also, generally, see, all, things, as, being, animated, and, constituted, by, qi, vital, air, subtle, breath, which, is, seen, as, a, force, that, circulates, throughout, the, universe, and, throughout, human, bodies, as, both, air, in, the, lungs, and, as, a, subtle, breath, throughout, the, body, s, meridians, and, organs, qi, is, in, constant, transformation, between, its, condensed, state, life, and, diluted, state, potential, these, two, different, states, of, qi, are, embodiments, of, yin, and, yang, two, complementary, forces, that, constantly, play, against, and, with, each, other, and, where, one, cannot, exist, without, the, other, taoist, texts, present, various, creation, stories, and, cosmogonies, classic, cosmogonies, are, nontheistic, presenting, a, natural, undirected, process, in, which, an, apophatic, undifferentiated, potentiality, called, wuwuji, without, non, differentiation, naturally, unfolds, into, wuji, primordial, oneness, non, differentiation, which, then, evolves, into, yin, yang, taiji, and, then, into, the, myriad, beings, as, in, the, tao, te, ching, later, medieval, models, included, the, idea, of, a, creator, god, mainly, seen, as, lord, lao, representing, order, and, creativity, taoist, cosmology, influences, taoist, soteriology, which, holds, that, one, can, return, to, the, root, guigen, of, the, universe, and, of, ourselves, which, is, also, the, tao, the, impersonal, source, yuan, of, all, things, in, taoism, human, beings, are, seen, as, a, microcosm, of, the, universe, and, thus, the, cosmological, forces, like, the, five, phases, are, also, present, in, the, form, of, the, zang, fu, organs, another, common, belief, is, that, there, are, various, gods, that, reside, in, human, bodies, as, a, consequence, it, is, believed, that, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, universe, can, be, achieved, by, understanding, oneself, another, important, element, of, taoist, cosmology, is, the, use, of, chinese, astrology, taoist, theology, can, be, defined, as, apophatic, given, its, philosophical, emphasis, on, the, formlessness, and, unknowable, nature, of, the, tao, and, the, primacy, of, the, way, rather, than, anthropomorphic, concepts, of, god, nearly, all, the, sects, share, this, core, belief, arguments, do, exist, the, monotheistic, concepts, in, taoism, however, taoism, does, include, many, deities, and, spirits, and, thus, can, also, be, considered, animistic, and, polytheistic, in, a, secondary, sense, since, they, are, considered, to, be, emanations, from, the, impersonal, and, nameless, ultimate, principle, some, taoist, theology, presents, the, three, pure, ones, at, the, top, of, the, pantheon, of, deities, which, was, a, hierarchy, emanating, from, the, tao, laozi, lao, tzu, is, considered, the, incarnation, of, one, of, the, three, and, worshiped, as, the, ancestral, founder, of, taoism, the, gods, and, immortals, believed, in, by, taoism, can, be, roughly, divided, into, two, categories, namely, gods, and, xian, gods, refers, to, deities, and, there, are, many, kinds, heaven, gods, celestials, earth, spirits, wuling, animism, the, spirit, of, all, things, netherworld, gods, gods, of, the, human, body, gods, of, the, human, ghost, etc, xian, are, those, who, have, acquired, perfect, cultivation, of, the, tao, persons, with, vast, supernatural, powers, unpredictable, changes, and, immortality, different, branches, of, taoism, often, have, differing, pantheons, of, lesser, deities, where, these, deities, reflect, different, notions, of, cosmology, lesser, deities, also, may, be, promoted, or, demoted, for, their, activity, some, varieties, of, popular, chinese, religion, incorporate, the, jade, emperor, y, huang, or, y, di, one, of, the, three, pure, ones, as, the, highest, god, historical, taoist, figures, and, people, who, are, considered, to, have, become, immortals, xian, are, also, venerated, as, well, by, both, clergy, and, laypeople, despite, these, hierarchies, of, deities, most, conceptions, of, tao, should, not, be, confused, with, the, western, sense, of, theism, being, one, with, the, tao, does, not, necessarily, indicate, a, union, with, an, eternal, spirit, in, for, example, the, hindu, theistic, sense, some, key, elements, of, taoist, practice, include, a, commitment, to, self, cultivation, wu, wei, and, attunement, to, the, patterns, of, the, tao, the, practice, of, taoism, seeks, to, develop, the, body, back, to, its, original, level, of, energy, and, restore, it, to, its, original, state, of, creation, the, body, is, no, longer, just, a, means, of, living, in, harmony, in, the, world, it, is, itself, a, universe, most, taoists, throughout, history, have, agreed, on, the, importance, of, self, cultivation, through, various, practices, which, were, seen, as, ways, to, transform, oneself, and, integrate, oneself, to, the, deepest, realities, communal, rituals, are, important, in, most, taoist, traditions, as, are, methods, of, self, cultivation, taoist, self, cultivation, practices, tend, to, focus, on, the, transformation, of, the, heartmind, together, with, bodily, substances, and, energies, like, jing, and, qi, and, their, connection, to, natural, and, universal, forces, patterns, and, powers, despite, the, detachment, from, reality, and, dissent, from, confucian, humanism, that, the, tao, te, ching, teaches, taoists, were, and, are, generally, not, misanthropes, or, nihilists, and, see, humans, as, an, important, class, of, things, in, the, world, however, in, most, taoist, views, humans, were, not, held, to, be, especially, important, in, comparison, to, other, aspects, of, the, world, and, taoist, metaphysics, that, were, seen, as, equally, or, more, special, similarly, some, taoists, had, similar, views, on, their, gods, or, the, gods, of, other, religions, according, to, louis, komjathy, taoist, practice, is, a, diverse, and, complex, subject, that, can, include, aesthetics, art, dietetics, ethics, health, and, longevity, practice, meditation, ritual, seasonal, attunement, scripture, study, and, so, forth, throughout, the, history, of, taoism, mountains, have, occupied, a, special, place, for, taoist, practice, they, are, seen, as, sacred, spaces, and, as, the, ideal, places, for, taoist, cultivation, and, taoist, monastic, or, eremitic, life, which, may, include, cloud, wandering, yunyou, in, the, mountains, and, dwelling, in, mountain, hermitages, an, or, grottoes, dong, tao, can, serve, as, a, life, energy, instead, of, qi, in, some, taoist, belief, systems, one, of, the, earliest, schemas, for, taoist, practice, was, the, nine, practices, or, nine, virtues, ji, x, ng, which, were, taught, in, the, celestial, masters, school, these, were, drawn, from, classic, taoist, sources, mainly, the, tao, te, ching, and, are, presented, in, the, laojun, jinglu, scriptural, statutes, of, lord, lao, dz, 786, the, nine, practices, are, ancient, chinese, religion, made, much, use, of, sacrifices, to, gods, and, ancestors, which, could, include, slaughtered, animals, such, as, pigs, and, ducks, or, fruit, the, taoist, celestial, master, zhang, daoling, rejected, food, and, animal, sacrifices, to, the, gods, today, many, taoist, temples, reject, animal, sacrifice, sacrifices, to, the, deities, remains, a, key, element, of, taoist, rituals, however, there, are, various, kinds, of, taoist, rituals, which, may, include, presenting, offerings, scripture, reading, sacrifices, incantations, purification, rites, confession, petitions, and, announcements, to, the, gods, observing, the, ethical, precepts, memorials, chanting, lectures, and, communal, feasts, on, particular, holidays, such, as, the, qingming, ching, ming, festival, street, parades, take, place, these, are, lively, affairs, that, involve, firecrackers, the, burning, of, hell, money, and, flower, covered, floats, broadcasting, traditional, music, they, also, variously, include, lion, dances, and, dragon, dances, human, occupied, puppets, often, of, the, seventh, lord, and, eighth, lord, gongfu, and, palanquins, carrying, images, of, deities, the, various, participants, are, not, considered, performers, but, rather, possessed, by, the, gods, and, spirits, in, question, taking, up, and, living, by, sets, of, ethical, precepts, is, another, important, practice, in, taoism, by, the, tang, dynasty, taoism, had, created, a, system, of, lay, discipleship, in, which, one, took, a, set, of, ten, precepts, taoism, the, five, precepts, taoism, are, identical, to, the, buddhist, five, precepts, which, are, to, avoid, killing, theft, sexual, misconduct, lying, and, intoxicants, like, alcohol, the, other, five, were, a, set, of, five, injunctions, 6, i, will, maintain, harmony, with, my, ancestors, and, family, and, never, disregard, my, kin, 7, when, i, see, someone, do, good, i, will, support, him, with, joy, and, delight, 8, when, i, see, someone, unfortunate, i, will, support, him, with, dignity, to, recover, good, fortune, 9, when, someone, comes, to, do, me, harm, i, will, not, harbor, thoughts, of, revenge, 10, as, long, as, all, beings, have, not, attained, the, dao, i, will, not, expect, to, do, so, myself, apart, from, these, common, ethical, precepts, taoist, traditions, also, have, larger, sets, of, precepts, that, are, often, reserved, for, ordained, priests, or, monastics, a, key, part, of, many, taoist, traditions, is, the, practice, of, divination, there, are, many, methods, used, by, chinese, taoists, including, i, ching, divination, chinese, astrological, divination, feng, shui, geomantic, divination, and, the, interpretation, of, various, omens, mediumship, and, exorcism, is, a, key, element, of, some, taoist, traditions, these, can, include, tongji, mediumship, and, the, practice, of, planchette, writing, or, spirit, writing, taoist, longevity, methods, are, closely, related, to, ancient, chinese, medicine, many, of, these, methods, date, back, to, tang, dynasty, figures, like, alchemist, sun, simiao, 582, 683, and, the, highest, clarity, patriarch, sima, chengzhen, 647, 735, the, goal, of, these, methods, range, from, better, health, and, longevity, to, immortality, key, elements, of, these, nourishing, life, yangsheng, methods, include, moderation, in, all, things, drink, food, etc, adapting, to, the, cycles, of, the, seasons, by, following, injunctions, regarding, healing, exercises, daoyin, and, breathwork, a, number, of, physical, practices, like, modern, forms, of, qigong, as, well, as, modern, internal, martial, arts, neijia, like, taijiquan, baguazhang, xingyiquan, and, liuhebafa, are, practiced, by, taoists, as, methods, of, cultivating, health, and, longevity, as, well, as, eliciting, internal, alchemical, transformations, however, these, methods, are, not, specifically, taoist, and, are, often, practiced, outside, of, taoist, contexts, another, key, longevity, method, is, ingestion, which, focuses, on, what, one, absorbs, or, consumes, from, one, s, environment, and, is, seen, as, affecting, what, one, becomes, diatectics, closely, influenced, by, chinese, medicine, is, a, key, element, of, ingestion, practice, and, there, are, numerous, taoist, diet, regimens, for, different, effects, such, as, ascetic, diets, monastic, diets, therapeutic, diets, and, alchemical, diets, that, use, herbs, and, minerals, one, common, practice, is, the, avoidance, of, grains, bigu, in, certain, cases, practices, like, vegetarianism, and, true, fasting, is, also, adopted, which, may, also, be, termed, bigu, some, taoists, thought, of, the, human, body, as, a, spiritual, nexus, with, thousands, of, shen, often, 36, 000, gods, who, were, likely, thought, of, as, at, least, somewhat, mental, in, nature, because, of, the, word, s, other, meaning, of, consciousness, that, could, be, communed, with, by, doing, various, methods, to, manipulate, the, yin, and, yang, of, the, body, as, well, as, its, qi, these, taoists, also, thought, of, the, human, body, as, a, metaphorical, existence, where, three, cinnabar, fields, that, represented, a, higher, level, of, reality, or, a, spiritual, kind, of, cinnabar, that, does, not, exist, in, normal, reality, a, method, of, meditation, used, by, these, taoists, was, visualizing, light, that, was, thought, to, be, qi, or, another, kind, of, life, energy, a, taoist, substituted, for, qi, or, believed, in, the, existence, of, instead, the, light, was, then, channeled, through, the, three, cinnabar, fields, forming, a, microcosmic, orbit, or, through, the, hands, and, feet, for, a, macrocosmic, orbit, the, 36, 000, shen, regulated, the, body, and, bodily, functions, through, a, bureaucratic, system, modeled, after, the, chinese, system, of, government, death, occurs, only, when, these, gods, leave, but, life, can, be, extended, by, meditating, while, visualizing, them, doing, good, deeds, and, avoiding, meat, and, wine, there, are, many, methods, of, taoist, meditation, often, referred, to, as, stillness, practice, jinggong, some, of, which, were, strongly, influenced, by, buddhist, methods, some, of, the, key, forms, of, taoist, meditation, are, a, key, element, of, many, schools, of, taoism, are, alchemical, practices, which, include, rituals, meditations, exercises, and, the, creation, of, various, alchemical, substances, the, goals, of, alchemy, include, physical, and, spiritual, transformation, aligning, oneself, spiritually, with, cosmic, forces, undertaking, ecstatic, spiritual, journeys, improving, physical, health, extending, one, s, life, and, even, becoming, an, immortal, xian, taoist, alchemy, can, be, found, in, early, taoist, scriptures, like, the, taiping, jing, and, the, baopuzi, there, are, two, main, kinds, of, alchemy, internal, alchemy, neidan, and, external, alchemy, waidan, internal, alchemy, neidan, literally, internal, elixir, which, focuses, on, the, transformation, and, increase, of, qi, in, the, body, developed, during, the, late, imperial, period, especially, during, the, tang, and, is, found, in, almost, all, taoist, schools, today, though, it, is, most, closely, associated, with, the, quanzhen, school, there, are, many, systems, of, internal, alchemy, with, different, methods, such, as, visualization, and, breathwork, in, the, late, imperial, period, neidan, developed, into, complex, systems, that, drew, on, numerous, elements, including, classic, taoist, texts, and, meditations, yangsheng, i, ching, symbology, taoist, cosmology, external, alchemy, concepts, and, terms, chinese, medicine, and, buddhist, influences, neidan, systems, tend, to, be, passed, on, through, oral, master, disciple, lineages, that, are, often, to, be, secret, livia, kohn, writes, that, the, main, goal, of, internal, alchemy, is, generally, understood, as, a, set, of, three, transformations, from, essence, jing, to, energy, qi, from, energy, to, spirit, shen, and, from, spirit, to, dao, common, methods, for, this, include, engaging, the, subtle, body, and, activating, the, microcosmic, orbit, louis, komjathy, adds, that, neidan, seeks, to, create, a, transcendent, spirit, usually, called, the, immortal, embryo, xiantai, or, yang, spirit, yangshen, some, religious, taoist, movements, view, traditional, texts, as, scriptures, that, are, considered, sacred, authoritative, binding, and, divinely, inspired, or, revealed, however, the, tao, te, ching, was, originally, viewed, as, human, wisdom, and, written, by, humans, for, humans, it, and, other, important, texts, acquired, authority, that, caused, them, to, be, regarded, as, sacred, perhaps, the, most, influential, texts, are, the, tao, te, ching, and, the, zhuangzi, throughout, the, history, of, taoism, the, tao, te, ching, has, been, a, central, text, used, for, ritual, self, cultivation, and, philosophical, purposes, according, to, legend, the, tao, te, ching, also, known, as, the, laozi, was, written, by, laozi, authorship, precise, date, of, origin, and, even, unity, of, the, text, are, still, subject, of, debate, and, will, probably, never, be, known, with, certainty, the, earliest, manuscripts, of, this, work, written, on, bamboo, tablets, date, back, to, the, late, 4th, century, bce, and, these, contain, significant, differences, from, the, later, received, edition, of, wang, bi, c, 226, 249, apart, from, the, guodian, text, and, the, wang, bi, edition, another, alternative, version, exists, the, mawangdui, tao, te, chings, louis, komjathy, writes, that, the, tao, te, ching, is, actually, a, multi, vocal, anthology, consisting, of, a, variety, of, historical, and, textual, layers, in, certain, respects, it, is, a, collection, of, oral, teachings, of, various, members, of, the, inner, cultivation, lineages, meanwhile, russell, kirkland, argues, that, the, text, arose, out, of, various, traditions, of, oral, wisdom, from, the, state, of, chu, that, were, written, circulated, edited, and, rewritten, by, different, hands, he, also, suggests, that, authors, from, the, jixia, academy, may, have, been, involved, in, the, editing, process, the, tao, te, ching, is, not, organized, in, any, clear, fashion, and, is, a, collection, of, different, sayings, on, various, themes, the, leading, themes, of, the, tao, te, ching, revolve, around, the, nature, of, tao, how, to, attain, it, and, de, the, inner, power, of, tao, as, well, as, the, idea, of, wei, wu, wei, tao, is, said, to, be, ineffable, and, accomplishes, great, things, through, small, lowly, effortless, and, feminine, yin, ways, which, are, compared, to, the, behavior, of, water, ancient, commentaries, on, the, tao, te, ching, are, important, texts, in, their, own, right, perhaps, the, oldest, one, the, heshang, gong, commentary, was, most, likely, written, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, other, important, commentaries, include, the, one, from, wang, bi, and, the, xiang, er, commentary, the, zhuangzi, book, of, master, zhuang, named, after, its, supposed, author, zhuang, zhou, is, a, highly, influential, composite, text, of, multi, vocal, writings, from, various, sources, and, historical, periods, the, commentator, and, editor, guo, xiang, c, ce, 300, helped, establish, the, text, as, an, important, source, for, taoist, thought, one, traditional, view, is, that, a, sage, called, zhuang, zhou, wrote, the, first, seven, chapters, the, inner, chapters, and, his, students, and, related, thinkers, were, responsible, for, the, other, parts, the, outer, and, miscellaneous, chapters, however, some, modern, scholars, like, russell, kirkland, argue, that, guo, xiang, is, actually, the, creator, of, the, 33, chapter, zhuangzi, text, and, that, there, is, no, solid, historical, data, for, the, existence, of, zhuang, zhou, himself, other, than, the, sparse, and, unreliable, mentions, in, sima, qian, zhuangzi, also, introduced, seven, versions, of, the, meeting, between, laozi, and, confucius, laozi, is, portrayed, as, growing, old, and, his, taoist, teachings, confuse, his, famous, interlocutors, zhuangzi, also, provides, the, only, record, of, laozi, s, death, the, zhuangzi, uses, anecdotes, parables, and, dialogues, to, express, one, of, its, main, themes, avoiding, cultural, constructs, and, instead, living, in, a, spontaneous, way, aligned, with, the, natural, world, this, way, of, living, might, be, perceived, as, useless, by, most, people, who, follow, their, own, common, sense, and, social, and, political, rules, but, this, uselessness, is, actually, a, wiser, alternative, since, it, is, more, in, accord, with, reality, taoism, draws, on, numerous, chinese, classics, that, are, not, themselves, taoist, texts, but, that, remain, important, sources, for, taoists, perhaps, the, most, important, of, these, is, the, ancient, divination, text, called, the, yijing, circa, 1150, bce, the, divination, method, in, the, yijing, and, its, associated, concepts, of, yin, and, yang, mapped, into, 64, hexagrams, combinations, of, the, 8, trigrams, has, influenced, taoism, from, its, inception, until, today, taoism, also, drew, on, other, non, taoist, chinese, classic, texts, including, there, are, many, other, important, taoist, texts, including, the, taoist, canon, treasury, of, tao, is, also, referred, to, as, the, daozang, it, was, originally, compiled, during, the, jin, tang, and, song, dynasties, the, extant, version, was, published, during, the, ming, dynasty, the, ming, daozang, includes, almost, 1, 500, texts, following, the, example, of, the, buddhist, tripi, aka, it, is, divided, into, three, dong, caves, or, grottoes, they, are, arranged, from, highest, to, lowest, taoist, generally, do, not, consult, published, versions, of, the, daozang, but, individually, choose, or, inherit, texts, included, in, the, daozang, these, texts, have, been, passed, down, for, generations, from, teacher, to, student, the, shangqing, school, has, a, tradition, of, approaching, taoism, through, scriptural, study, it, is, believed, that, by, reciting, certain, texts, often, enough, one, will, be, rewarded, with, immortality, the, taijitu, commonly, known, as, the, yin, and, yang, symbol, or, simply, the, yin, yang, and, the, bagua, are, important, symbols, in, taoism, because, they, represent, key, elements, of, taoist, cosmology, see, above, many, taoist, as, well, as, non, taoist, organizations, make, use, of, these, symbols, and, they, may, appear, on, flags, and, logos, temple, floors, or, stitched, into, clerical, robes, what, has, become, the, standardised, yin, yang, taijitu, originated, as, a, taoist, symbol, in, the, 10th, century, ce, during, the, early, song, dynasty, the, tiger, and, dragon, are, more, ancient, symbols, for, yin, and, yang, respectively, and, these, two, animals, are, still, widely, used, in, taoist, art, taoist, temples, in, southern, china, and, taiwan, may, often, be, identified, by, their, roofs, which, feature, dragons, tigers, and, phoenixes, with, the, phoenix, also, standing, for, yin, made, from, multicolored, ceramic, tiles, in, general, though, chinese, taoist, architecture, lacks, universal, features, that, distinguish, it, from, other, structures, taoist, temples, may, fly, square, or, triangular, flags, they, typically, feature, mystical, writing, talismans, or, diagrams, and, are, intended, to, fulfill, various, functions, including, providing, guidance, for, the, spirits, of, the, dead, bringing, good, fortune, increasing, life, span, etc, other, flags, and, banners, may, be, those, of, the, gods, or, immortals, themselves, drawings, of, the, big, dipper, also, called, the, bushel, are, also, important, symbols, in, the, shang, dynasty, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, chinese, thought, regarded, the, big, dipper, as, a, deity, while, in, later, periods, it, came, to, symbolize, taiji, a, related, symbol, is, the, flaming, pearl, which, stands, for, the, pole, star, and, may, be, seen, on, such, roofs, between, two, dragons, as, well, as, on, the, hairpin, of, a, celestial, master, some, taoists, saw, the, stars, as, knots, in, the, net, of, heaven, that, connected, everything, in, heaven, and, earth, many, taoists, saw, the, tao, as, the, pearl, of, the, sage, and, a, conjunction, between, yin, yang, taoists, also, revered, pearls, more, generally, seeing, lung, dragon, celestials, as, emerging, from, the, glint, of, light, off, of, a, pearl, that, existed, in, the, mists, of, chaos, and, trapped, in, an, endless, cycle, where, they, continually, retrieve, the, pearl, that, makes, them, out, of, the, mists, some, internal, alchemy, taoists, worshipped, mercury, as, divine, water, and, an, embodiment, of, consciousness, that, was, a, flowing, pearl, in, the, later, qing, dynasty, taoists, and, intellectuals, who, leaned, towards, taoism, used, the, wuxing, as, symbols, of, leadership, and, good, governance, using, old, religious, texts, and, various, historiographies, made, in, prior, dynasties, to, assign, a, phase, from, the, five, wuxing, to, different, chinese, dynasties, symbols, that, represent, longevity, and, immortality, are, particularly, popular, and, these, include, cranes, pine, trees, and, the, peaches, of, immortality, associated, with, the, queen, mother, of, the, west, natural, symbols, are, also, common, and, include, gourds, caves, clouds, mountains, and, the, animals, of, the, chinese, zodiac, other, symbols, used, by, taoists, include, the, yellow, river, map, the, luoshu, square, i, ching, coins, taoist, talismans, fulu, the, four, symbols, mythical, creatures, and, various, chinese, characters, such, as, the, character, for, tao, and, the, shou, longevity, character, taoist, priests, also, wear, distinctive, robes, such, as, the, daojiao, fushi, and, taoist, versions, of, the, daopao, which, symbolize, their, status, and, school, affiliation, taoist, communities, can, include, a, wide, variety, of, people, and, groups, including, daoshi, hermits, monastics, teachers, householders, ascetics, family, lineages, teacher, disciple, lineages, urban, associations, temples, and, monasteries, according, to, russell, kirkland, throughout, most, of, its, history, most, taoist, traditions, were, founded, and, maintained, by, aristocrats, or, by, members, of, the, later, well, to, do, gentry, class, the, only, real, exception, is, the, celestial, masters, movement, which, had, a, strong, basis, in, the, lower, classes, though, even, this, movement, had, a, hereditary, leadership, made, up, of, figures, of, the, chang, clan, for, generations, the, number, of, taoists, is, difficult, to, estimate, due, to, a, variety, of, factors, including, defining, taoism, according, to, a, survey, of, religion, in, china, in, 2010, the, number, of, people, practicing, some, form, of, chinese, folk, religion, is, near, to, 950, million, which, is, 70, of, chinese, among, these, 173, million, 13, claim, an, affiliation, with, taoist, practices, 12, million, people, stated, that, they, were, taoists, a, term, traditionally, used, exclusively, for, initiates, priests, and, experts, of, taoist, rituals, and, methods, since, the, creation, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, government, has, encouraged, a, revival, of, taoist, traditions, in, codified, settings, in, 1956, the, chinese, taoist, association, was, formed, to, administer, the, activities, of, all, registered, taoist, orders, and, received, official, approval, in, 1957, it, was, disbanded, during, the, cultural, revolution, under, mao, zedong, but, was, reestablished, in, 1980, the, headquarters, of, the, association, are, at, the, baiyunguan, or, white, cloud, temple, of, beijing, belonging, to, the, longmen, branch, of, the, quanzhen, tradition, since, 1980, many, taoist, monasteries, and, temples, have, been, reopened, or, rebuilt, both, belonging, to, the, zhengyi, or, quanzhen, schools, and, clergy, ordination, has, been, resumed, taoist, literature, and, art, has, influenced, the, cultures, of, korea, japan, and, vietnam, organized, taoism, seems, not, to, have, attracted, a, large, non, chinese, following, until, modern, times, in, taiwan, 7, 5, million, people, 33, of, the, population, identify, themselves, as, taoists, data, collected, in, 2010, for, religious, demographics, of, hong, kong, and, singapore, show, that, respectively, 14, and, 11, of, the, people, of, these, cities, identify, as, taoists, followers, of, daoism, are, present, in, chinese, migr, communities, outside, asia, it, has, attracted, followers, with, no, chinese, heritage, for, example, in, brazil, there, are, daoist, temples, in, s, o, paulo, and, rio, de, janeiro, that, are, affiliated, with, the, taoist, society, of, china, membership, of, these, temples, is, entirely, of, non, chinese, ancestry, throughout, chinese, history, there, have, been, many, examples, of, art, being, influenced, by, taoism, notable, painters, influenced, by, taoism, include, wu, wei, huang, gongwang, mi, fu, muqi, fachang, shitao, ni, zan, tang, mi, and, wang, zengzu, taoist, arts, and, belles, lettres, represents, the, different, regions, dialects, and, time, spans, that, are, commonly, associated, with, taoism, ancient, taoist, art, was, commissioned, by, the, aristocracy, however, scholars, masters, and, adepts, also, directly, engaged, in, the, art, themselves, taoism, never, had, a, unified, political, theory, while, huang, lao, positions, justified, a, strong, emperor, as, the, legitimate, ruler, the, taoist, primitivists, of, chapters, 8, 11, of, the, zhuangzi, argued, for, a, kind, of, anarchism, a, more, moderate, position, is, presented, in, the, inner, chapters, of, the, zhuangzi, in, which, the, political, life, is, presented, with, disdain, and, some, kind, of, pluralism, or, perspectivism, is, preferred, the, syncretist, position, found, in, texts, like, the, huainanzi, and, some, of, the, outer, chapters, of, the, zhuangzi, blend, taoist, positions, with, confucian, views, many, scholars, believe, taoism, arose, as, a, countermovement, to, confucianism, the, philosophical, terms, tao, and, de, are, indeed, shared, by, both, taoism, and, confucianism, zhuangzi, explicitly, criticized, confucian, and, mohist, tenets, in, his, work, in, general, taoism, rejects, the, confucian, emphasis, on, rituals, hierarchical, social, order, and, conventional, morality, and, favors, naturalness, spontaneity, and, individualism, instead, the, entry, of, buddhism, into, china, was, marked, by, significant, interaction, and, syncretism, with, taoism, originally, seen, as, a, kind, of, foreign, taoism, buddhism, s, scriptures, were, translated, into, chinese, using, the, taoist, vocabulary, representatives, of, early, chinese, buddhism, like, sengzhao, and, tao, sheng, knew, and, were, deeply, influenced, by, the, taoist, keystone, texts, taoism, especially, shaped, the, development, of, chan, buddhism, introducing, elements, like, the, concept, of, naturalness, distrust, of, scripture, and, text, and, emphasis, on, embracing, this, life, and, living, in, the, every, moment, zhuangzi, s, statements, that, the, tao, was, omnipresent, and, that, creation, escorts, animals, and, humans, to, death, influenced, chinese, buddhist, practitioners, and, scholars, especially, chan, buddhists, on, the, other, hand, taoism, also, incorporated, buddhist, elements, during, the, tang, dynasty, examples, of, such, influence, include, monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition, of, alcohol, the, doctrine, of, emptiness, and, collecting, scripture, in, tripartite, organization, in, certain, sects, ideological, and, political, rivals, for, centuries, taoism, confucianism, hinduism, and, buddhism, deeply, influenced, one, another, for, example, wang, bi, one, of, the, most, influential, philosophical, commentators, on, laozi, and, the, i, ching, was, a, confucian, the, three, rivals, also, share, some, similar, values, with, all, three, embracing, a, humanist, philosophy, emphasizing, moral, behavior, and, human, perfection, in, time, most, chinese, people, identified, to, some, extent, with, all, three, traditions, simultaneously, this, became, institutionalized, when, aspects, of, the, three, schools, were, synthesized, in, the, neo, confucian, school, christian, and, taoist, contact, often, took, place, in, the, tang, dynasty, and, some, scholars, believe, that, the, church, of, the, east, influenced, taoist, thought, on, the, three, pure, ones, emperor, taizong, encouraged, this, and, taoists, who, agreed, with, him, and, his, laws, incorporated, elements, of, christianity, islam, manichaeism, judaism, confucianism, and, buddhism, into, their, faith, comparisons, between, taoism, and, epicureanism, have, focused, on, the,

prominence, of, the, epicurus, like, chinese, sage, yang, chu, in, the, foundational, taoist, writings, some, authors, have, undertaken, comparative, studies, of, taoism, and, christianity, this, has, been, of, interest, for, students, of, the, history, of, religion, such, as, j, j, m, de, groot, among, others, a, comparison, of, the, teachings, of, laozi, and, jesus, of, nazareth, has, been, made, by, several, authors, such, as, martin, aronson, and, toropov, hansen, 2002, who, believe, that, there, are, parallels, that, should, not, be, ignored, in, the, opinion, of, j, isamu, yamamoto, the, main, difference, is, that, christianity, preaches, a, personal, god, while, daoism, does, not, yet, a, number, of, authors, including, lin, yutang, have, argued, that, some, moral, and, ethical, tenets, of, the, religions, are, similar, in, neighboring, vietnam, taoist, values, have, been, shown, to, adapt, to, social, norms, and, formed, emerging, sociocultural, beliefs, together, with,
