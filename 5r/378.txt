in, ancient, greek, religion, and, mythology, demeter, d, m, i, t, r, attic, d, m, t, r, doric, d, m, t, r, is, the, olympian, goddess, of, the, harvest, and, agriculture, presiding, over, crops, grains, food, and, the, fertility, of, the, earth, although, demeter, is, mostly, known, as, a, grain, goddess, she, also, appeared, as, a, goddess, of, health, birth, and, marriage, and, had, connections, to, the, underworld, she, is, also, called, deo, d, in, greek, tradition, demeter, is, the, second, child, of, the, titans, rhea, and, cronus, and, sister, to, hestia, hera, hades, poseidon, and, zeus, like, her, other, siblings, except, zeus, she, was, swallowed, by, her, father, as, an, infant, and, rescued, by, zeus, through, her, brother, zeus, she, became, the, mother, of, persephone, a, fertility, goddess, and, resurrection, deity, one, of, the, most, notable, homeric, hymns, the, homeric, hymn, to, demeter, tells, the, story, of, persephone, s, abduction, by, hades, and, demeter, s, search, for, her, when, hades, the, king, of, the, underworld, wished, to, make, persephone, his, wife, he, abducted, her, from, a, field, while, she, was, picking, flowers, with, zeus, leave, demeter, searched, everywhere, to, find, her, missing, daughter, to, no, avail, until, she, was, informed, that, hades, had, taken, her, to, the, underworld, in, response, demeter, neglected, her, duties, as, goddess, of, agriculture, plunging, the, earth, into, a, deadly, famine, where, nothing, would, grow, causing, mortals, to, die, zeus, ordered, hades, to, return, persephone, to, her, mother, to, avert, the, disaster, however, because, persephone, had, eaten, food, from, the, underworld, she, could, not, stay, with, demeter, forever, but, had, to, divide, the, year, between, her, mother, and, her, husband, explaining, the, seasonal, cycle, as, demeter, does, not, let, plants, grow, while, persephone, is, gone, her, cult, titles, include, sito, she, of, the, grain, as, the, giver, of, food, or, grain, and, thesmophoros, thesmos, divine, order, unwritten, law, phoros, bringer, bearer, giver, of, customs, or, legislator, in, association, with, the, secret, female, only, festival, called, the, thesmophoria, though, demeter, is, often, described, simply, as, the, goddess, of, the, harvest, she, presided, also, over, the, sacred, law, and, the, cycle, of, life, and, death, she, and, her, daughter, persephone, were, the, central, figures, of, the, eleusinian, mysteries, a, religious, tradition, that, predated, the, olympian, pantheon, and, which, may, have, its, roots, in, the, mycenaean, period, c, 1400, 1200, bc, demeter, was, often, considered, to, be, the, same, figure, as, the, anatolian, goddess, cybele, and, she, was, identified, with, the, roman, goddess, ceres, demeter, may, appear, in, linear, a, as, da, ma, te, on, three, documents, ar, zf, 1, and, 2, and, ky, za, 2, all, three, dedicated, to, religious, situations, and, all, three, bearing, just, the, name, i, da, ma, te, on, ar, zf, 1, and, 2, it, is, unlikely, that, demeter, appears, as, da, ma, te, in, a, linear, b, mycenean, greek, inscription, py, en, 609, the, word, da, ma, te, probably, refers, to, households, on, the, other, hand, si, to, po, ti, ni, ja, potnia, of, the, grain, is, regarded, as, referring, to, her, bronze, age, predecessor, or, to, one, of, her, epithets, demeter, s, character, as, mother, goddess, is, identified, in, the, second, element, of, her, name, meter, derived, from, proto, indo, european, pie, m, h, t, r, mother, in, antiquity, different, explanations, were, already, proffered, for, the, first, element, of, her, name, it, is, possible, that, da, a, word, which, corresponds, to, g, in, attic, is, the, doric, form, of, de, earth, the, old, name, of, the, chthonic, earth, goddess, and, that, demeter, is, mother, earth, liddell, scott, find, this, improbable, and, beekes, writes, there, is, no, indication, that, means, earth, although, it, has, also, been, assumed, in, the, name, of, poseidon, found, in, the, linear, b, inscription, e, ne, si, da, o, ne, earth, shaker, john, chadwick, also, argues, that, the, d, element, in, the, name, of, demeter, is, not, so, simply, equated, with, earth, m, l, west, has, proposed, that, the, word, demeter, initially, damater, could, be, a, borrowing, from, an, illyrian, deity, attested, in, the, messapic, goddess, damatura, with, a, form, d, earth, from, pie, d, e, m, attached, to, matura, mother, akin, to, the, illyrian, god, dei, paturos, dei, sky, attached, to, paturos, father, the, lesbian, form, d, may, simply, reflect, a, different, colloquial, pronunciation, of, the, non, greek, name, another, theory, suggests, that, the, element, de, might, be, connected, with, deo, an, epithet, of, demeter, and, it, could, derive, from, the, cretan, word, dea, ionic, zeia, variously, identified, with, emmer, spelt, rye, or, other, grains, by, modern, scholars, so, that, she, is, the, mother, and, the, giver, of, food, generally, this, view, is, shared, by, british, scholar, jane, ellen, harrison, who, suggests, that, d, meter, s, name, means, grain, mother, instead, of, earth, mother, an, alternative, proto, indo, european, etymology, comes, through, potnia, and, despoina, where, des, represents, a, derivative, of, pie, dem, house, dome, and, demeter, is, mother, of, the, house, from, pie, dems, m, h, t, r, r, s, p, beekes, rejects, a, greek, interpretation, but, not, necessarily, an, indo, european, one, demeter, was, frequently, associated, with, images, of, the, harvest, including, flowers, fruit, and, grain, she, was, also, sometimes, pictured, with, her, daughter, persephone, however, demeter, is, not, generally, portrayed, with, any, of, her, consorts, the, exception, is, iasion, the, youth, of, crete, who, lay, with, her, in, a, thrice, ploughed, field, and, was, killed, afterward, by, a, jealous, zeus, with, a, thunderbolt, demeter, is, assigned, the, zodiac, constellation, virgo, the, virgin, by, marcus, manilius, in, his, 1st, century, roman, work, astronomicon, in, art, the, constellation, virgo, holds, spica, a, sheaf, of, wheat, in, her, hand, and, sits, beside, constellation, leo, the, lion, in, arcadia, she, was, known, as, black, demeter, she, was, said, to, have, taken, the, form, of, a, mare, to, escape, the, pursuit, of, her, younger, brother, poseidon, and, having, been, raped, by, him, despite, her, disguise, she, dressed, all, in, black, and, retreated, into, a, cave, to, mourn, and, to, purify, herself, she, was, consequently, depicted, with, the, head, of, a, horse, in, this, region, a, sculpture, of, the, black, demeter, was, made, by, onatas, in, the, earliest, conceptions, of, demeter, she, is, the, goddess, of, grain, and, threshing, however, her, functions, were, extended, beyond, the, fields, and, she, was, often, identified, with, the, earth, goddess, gaia, some, of, the, epithets, of, gaia, and, demeter, are, similar, showing, the, identity, of, their, nature, in, most, of, her, myths, and, cults, demeter, is, the, grain, mother, or, the, earth,

death, and, fertility, demeter, is, the, giver, of, the, secret, rites, and, the, giver, of, the, laws, of, cereal, agriculture, she, was, occasionally, identified, with, the, great, mother, rhea, cybele, who, was, worshipped, in, crete, and, asia, minor, with, the, music, of, cymbals, and, violent, rites, it, seems, that, poppies, were, connected, with, the, cult, of, the, great, mother, in, epic, poetry, and, hesiod, s, theogony, demeter, is, the, grain, mother, the, goddess, of, cereals, who, provides, grain, for, bread, and, blesses, its, harvesters, in, homer, s, iliad, the, blonde,

karpophoros, bringer, of, fruits, malophoros, apple, bearer, and, sometimes, oria, all, the, fruits, of, the, season, these, epithets, show, an, identity, in, nature, with, the, earth, goddess, the, central, theme, in, the, eleusinian, mysteries, was, the, reunion, of, persephone, with, her, mother, demeter, when, new, crops, were, reunited, with, the, old, seed, a, form, of, eternity, according, to, the, athenian, rhetorician, isocrates, demeter, s, greatest, gifts, to, humankind, were, agriculture, which, gave, to, men, a, civilized, way, of, life, and, the, mysteries, which, give, the, initiate, higher, hopes, in, this, life, and, the, afterlife, these, two, gifts, were, intimately, connected, in, demeter, s, myths, and, mystery, cults, demeter, is, the, giver, of, mystic, rites, and, the, giver, of, the, civilized, way, of, life, teaching, the, laws, of, agriculture, her, epithet, eleusinia, relates, her, with, the, eleusinian, mysteries, however, at, sparta, eleusinia, had, an, early, use, and, it, was, probably, a, name, rather, than, an, epithet, demeter, thesmophoros, law, giving, is, closely, associated, to, the, laws, of, cereal, agriculture, the, festival, thesmophoria, was, celebrated, throughout, greece, and, was, connected, to, a, form, of, agrarian, magic, near, pheneus, in, arcadia, she, was, known, as, demeter, thesmia, lawfull, and, she, received, rites, according, to, the, local, version, demeter, s, emblem, is, the, poppy, a, bright, red, flower, that, grows, among, the, barley, in, addition, to, her, role, as, an, agricultural, goddess, demeter, was, often, worshipped, more, generally, as, a, goddess, of, the, earth, from, which, crops, spring, up, her, individuality, was, rooted, to, the, less, developed, personality, of, gaia, earth, in, arcadia, demeter, melaina, the, black, demeter, was, represented, as, snake, haired, with, a, horse, s, head, holding, a, dove, and, dolphin, perhaps, to, symbolize, her, power, over, the, underworld, the, air, and, the, water, the, cult, of, demeter, in, the, region, was, related, to, despoina, a, very, old, chthonic, divinity, demeter, shares, the, double, function, of, death, and, fertility, with, her, daughter, persephone, demeter, and, persephone, were, called, despoinai, the, mistresses, and, demeters, this, duality, was, also, used, in, the, classical, period, thesmophoroi, double, named, goddesses, and, particularly, in, an, oath, by, the, two, goddesses, in, the, cult, of, phlya, she, was, worshipped, as, anesidora, who, sends, up, gifts, from, the, underworld, in, sparta, she, was, known, as, demeter, chthonia, chthonic, demeter, after, each, death, the, mourning, should, end, with, a, sacrifice, to, the, goddess, pausanias, believes, that, her, cult, was, introduced, from, hermione, where, demeter, was, associated, with, hades, in, a, local, legend, a, hollow, in, the, earth, was, the, entrance, to, the, underworld, by, which, the, souls, could, pass, easily, in, elis, she, was, called, demeter, chamyne, goddess, of, the, ground, in, an, old, chthonic, cult, associated, with, the, descent, to, hades, at, levadia, the, goddess, was,

goddess, of, an, ancient, amphictyony, thermopylae, is, the, place, of, hot, springs, considered, to, be, entrances, to, hades, since, demeter, was, a, chthonic, goddess, in, the, older, local, cults, the, athenians, called, the, dead, demetrioi, and, this, may, reflect, a, link, between, demeter, and, the, ancient, cult, of, the, dead, linked, to, the, agrarian, belief, that, a, new, life, would, sprout, from, the, dead, body, as, a, new, plant, arises, from, buried, seed, this, was, most, likely, a, belief, shared, by, initiates, in, demeter, s, mysteries, as, interpreted, by, pindar, blessed, is, he, who, has, seen, before, he, goes, under, the, earth, for, he, knows, the, end, of, life, and, knows, also, its, divine, beginning, in, arcadia, demeter, had, the, epithets, erinys, fury, and, melaina, black, which, are, associated, with, the, myth, of, demeter, s, rape, by, poseidon, the, epithets, stress, the, darker, side, of, her, character, and, her, relation, to, the, dark, underworld, in, an, old, chthonic, cult, associated, with, wooden, structures, xoana, erinys, had, a, similar, function, with, the, avenging, dike, justice, in, the, mysteries, of, pheneus, the, goddess, was, known, as, cidaria, her, priest, would, put, on, the, mask, of, demeter, which, was, kept, secret, the, cult, may, have, been, connected, with, both, the, underworld, and, a, form, of, agrarian, magic, theocritus, described, one, of, demeter, s, earlier, roles, as, that, of, a, goddess, of, poppies, for, the, greeks, demeter, was, still, a, poppy, goddess, bearing, sheaves, and, poppies, in, both, hands, karl, ker, nyi, asserted, that, poppies, were, connected, with, a, cretan, cult, which, was, eventually, carried, to, the, eleusinian, mysteries, in, classical, greece, in, a, clay, statuette, from, gazi, the, minoan, poppy, goddess, wears, the, seed, capsules, sources, of, nourishment, and, narcosis, in, her, diadem, according, to, ker, nyi, it, seems, probable, that, the, great, mother, goddess, who, bore, the, names, rhea, and, demeter, brought, the, poppy, with, her, from, her, cretan, cult, to, eleusis, and, it, is, almost, certain, that, in, the, cretan, cult, sphere, opium, was, prepared, from, poppies, in, an, older, tradition, in, crete, the, vegetation, cult, was, related, with, the, deity, of, the, cave, during, the, bronze, age, a, goddess, of,

stated, that, it, was, considered, sacred, by, the, locals, because, it, protected, their, crops, they, called, the, statue, saint, demetra, a, saint, whose, story, had, many, similarities, to, the, myth, of, demeter, and, persephone, except, that, her, daughter, had, been, abducted, by, the, turks, and, not, by, hades, the, locals, covered, the, statue, with, flowers, to, ensure, the, fertility, of, their, fields, this, tradition, continued, until, the, 19th, century, when, the, statue, was, forcibly, removed, by, edward, daniel, clarke, who, presented, it, to, the, university, of, cambridge,

3rd, century, bc, demeter, s, temple, at, enna, in, sicily, was, acknowledged, as, ceres, oldest, most, authoritative, cult, centre, and, libera, was, recognized, as, proserpina, roman, equivalent, to, persephone, their, joint, cult, recalls, demeter, s, search, for, persephone, after, the, latter, s, abduction, into, the, underworld, by, hades, at, the, aventine, the, new, cult, took, its, place, alongside, the, old, it, did, not, refer, to, liber, whose, open, and, gender, mixed, cult, played, a, central, role, in, plebeian, culture, as, a, patron, and, protector, of, plebeian, rights, freedoms, and, values, the, exclusively, female, initiates, and, priestesses, of, the, new, greek, style, mysteries, of, ceres, and, proserpina, were, expected, to, uphold, rome, s, traditional,

century, bce, in, asia, minor, demeter, was, also, considered, equivalent, to, the, phrygian, goddess, cybele, demeter, s, festival, of, thesmophoria, was, popular, throughout, asia, minor, and, the, myth, of, persephone, and, adonis, in, many, ways, mirrors, the, myth, of, cybele, and, attis, some, late, antique, sources, syncretized, several, great, goddess, figures, into, a, single, deity, for, example, the, platonist, philosopher, apuleius, writing, in, the, late, 2nd, century, identified, ceres, demeter, with, isis, having, her, declare, i, mother, of, the, universe, mistress, of, all, the, elements, first, born, of, the, ages, highest, of, the, gods, queen, of, the, shades, first, of, those, who, dwell, in, heaven, representing, in, one, shape, all, gods, and, goddesses, my, will, controls, the, shining, heights, of, heaven, the, health, giving, sea, winds, and, the, mournful, silences, of, hell, the, entire, world, worships, my, single, godhead, in, a, thousand, shapes, with, divers, rites, and, under, many, a, different, name, the, phrygians, first, born, of, mankind, call, me, the, pessinuntian, mother, of, the, gods, the, ancient, eleusinians, actaean, ceres, and, the, egyptians, who, excel, in, ancient, learning, honour, me, with, the, worship, which, is, truly, mine, and, call, me, by, my, true, name, queen, isis, alongside, the, rest, of, her, siblings, with, the, exception, of, her, youngest, brother, zeus, she, was, swallowed, as, a, newborn, by, her, father, due, to, his, fear, of, being, overthrown, by, one, of, his, children, she, was, later, freed, when, zeus, made, cronus, disgorge, all, of, his, children, by, giving, him, a, special, potion, demeter, is, notable, as, the, mother, of, persephone, described, by, both, hesiod, and, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, demeter, as, the, result, of, a, union, with, her, younger, brother, zeus, an, alternate, recounting, of, the, matter, appears, in, a, fragment, of, the, lost, orphic, theogony, which, preserves, part, of, a, myth, in, which, zeus, mates, with, his, mother, rhea, in, the, form, of, a, snake, explaining, the, origin, of, the, symbol, on, hermes, staff, their, daughter, is, said, to, be, persephone, whom, zeus, in, turn, mates, with, to, conceive, dionysus, according, to, the, orphic, fragments, after, becoming, the, mother, of, zeus, she, who, was, formerly, rhea, became, demeter, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, figures, of, the, queen, of, the, underworld, and, the, daughter, of, demeter, were, initially, considered, separate, goddesses, however, they, must, have, become, conflated, by, the, time, of, hesiod, in, the, 7th, century, bc, demeter, and, persephone, were, often, worshipped, together, and, were, often, referred, to, by, joint, cultic, titles, in, their, cult, at, eleusis, they, were, referred, to, simply, as, the, goddesses, usually, distinguished, as, the, older, and, the, younger, in, rhodes, and, sparta, they, were, worshipped, as, the, demeters, in, the, thesmophoria, they, were, known, as, the, thesmophoroi, the, legislators, in, arcadia, they, were, known, as, the, great, goddesses, and, the, mistresses, in, mycenaean, pylos, demeter, and, persephone, were, probably, called, the, queens, wa, na, ssoi, both, homer, and, hesiod, writing, c, 700, bc, described, demeter, making, love, with, the, agricultural, hero, iasion, in, a, ploughed, field, during, the, marriage, of, cadmus, and, harmonia, according, to, hesiod, this, union, resulted, in, the, birth, of, plutus, according, to, diodorus, siculus, in, his, bibliotheca, historica, written, in, the, 1st, century, bc, demeter, and, zeus, were, also, the, parents, of, dionysus, diodorus, described, the, myth, of, dionysus, double, birth, once, from, the, earth, i, e, demeter, when, the, plant, sprouts, and, once, from, the, vine, when, the, fruit, sprouts, from, the, plant, diodorus, also, related, a, version, of, the, myth, of, dionysus, destruction, by, the, titans, sons, of, gaia, who, boiled, him, and, how, demeter, gathered, up, his, remains, so, that, he, could, be, born, a, third, time, diod, iii, 62, diodorus, states, that, dionysus, birth, from, zeus, and, his, older, sister, demeter, was, somewhat, of, a, minority, belief, possibly, via, conflation, of, demeter, with, her, daughter, as, most, sources, state, that, the, parents, of, dionysus, were, zeus, and, persephone, and, later, zeus, and, semele, hesiod, s, theogony, c, 700, bc, describes, demeter, as, the, second, daughter, of, cronus, and, rhea, and, the, sister, of, hestia, hera, hades, poseidon, and, zeus, in, arcadia, a, major, arcadian, deity, known, as, despoina, mistress, was, said, to, be, the, daughter, of, demeter, and, poseidon, according, to, pausanias, a, thelpusian, tradition, said, that, during, demeter, s, search, for, persephone, poseidon, pursued, her, demeter, turned, into, a, horse, to, avoid, her, younger, brother, s, advances, however, he, turned, into, a, stallion, and, mated, with, the, goddess, resulting, in, the, birth, of, the, horse, god, arion, and, a, daughter, whose, name, they, are, not, wont, to, divulge, to, the, uninitiated, elsewhere, he, says, that, the, phigalians, assert, that, the, offspring, of, poseidon, and, demeter, was, not, a, horse, but, despoina, as, the, arcadians, call, her, in, orphic, literature, demeter, seems, to, be, the, mother, of, the, witchcraft, goddess, hecate, the, goddess, took, mecon, a, young, athenian, as, a, lover, he, was, at, some, point, transformed, into, a, poppy, flower, demeter, s, daughter, persephone, was, abducted, to, the, underworld, by, hades, who, received, permission, from, her, father, zeus, to, take, her, as, his, bride, demeter, searched, for, her, ceaselessly, for, nine, days, preoccupied, with, her, grief, hecate, then, approached, her, and, said, that, while, she, had, not, seen, what, happened, to, persephone, she, heard, her, screams, together, the, two, goddesses, went, to, helios, the, sun, god, who, witnessed, everything, that, happened, on, earth, thanks, to, his, lofty, position, helios, then, revealed, to, demeter, that, hades, had, snatched, a, screaming, persephone, to, make, her, his, wife, with, the, permission, of, zeus, the, girl, s, father, demeter, then, filled, with, anger, the, seasons, halted, living, things, ceased, their, growth, and, began, to, die, faced, with, the, extinction, of, all, life, on, earth, zeus, sent, his, messenger, hermes, to, the, underworld, to, bring, persephone, back, hades, agreed, to, release, her, if, she, had, eaten, nothing, while, in, his, realm, but, persephone, had, eaten, a, small, number, of, pomegranate, seeds, this, bound, her, to, hades, and, the, underworld, for, certain, months, of, every, year, most, likely, the, dry, mediterranean, summer, when, plant, life, is, threatened, by, drought, despite, the, popular, belief, that, it, is, autumn, or, winter, there, are, several, variations, on, the, basic, myth, the, earliest, account, the, homeric, hymn, to, demeter, relates, that, persephone, is, secretly, slipped, a, pomegranate, seed, by, hades, and, in, ovid, s, version, persephone, willingly, and, secretly, eats, the, pomegranate, seeds, thinking, to, deceive, hades, but, is, discovered, and, made, to, stay, contrary, to, popular, perception, persephone, s, time, in, the, underworld, does, not, correspond, with, the, unfruitful, seasons, of, the, ancient, greek, calendar, nor, her, return, to, the, upper, world, with, springtime, demeter, s, descent, to, retrieve, persephone, from, the, underworld, is, connected, to, the, eleusinian, mysteries, the, myth, of, the, capture, of, persephone, seems, to, be, pre, greek, in, the, greek, version, ploutos, wealth, represents, the, wealth, of, the, corn, that, was, stored, in, underground, silos, or, ceramic, jars, pithoi, similar, subterranean, pithoi, were, used, in, ancient, times, for, funerary, practices, at, the, beginning, of, the, autumn, when, the, corn, of, the, old, crop, is, laid, on, the, fields, she, ascends, and, is, reunited, with, her, mother, demeter, for, at, this, time, the, old, crop, and, the, new, meet, each, other, in, the, orphic, tradition, while, she, was, searching, for, her, daughter, a, mortal, woman, named, baubo, received, demeter, as, her, guest, and, offered, her, a, meal, and, wine, demeter, declined, them, both, because, she, mourned, the, loss, of, persephone, baubo, then, thinking, she, had, displeased, the, goddess, lifted, her, skirt, and, showed, her, genitalia, to, the, goddess, simultaneously, revealing, iacchus, demeter, s, son, demeter, was, most, pleased, with, the, sight, and, delighted, she, accepted, the, food, and, wine, this, tale, survives, in, the, account, of, clement, of, alexandria, an, early, christian, writer, who, wrote, about, pagan, practices, and, mythology, several, baubo, figurines, figurines, of, women, revealing, their, vulvas, have, been, discovered, supporting, the, story, demeter, s, search, for, her, daughter, persephone, took, her, to, the, palace, of, celeus, the, king, of, eleusis, in, attica, she, assumed, the, form, of, an, old, woman, and, asked, him, for, shelter, he, took, her, in, to, nurse, demophon, and, triptolemus, his, sons, by, metanira, to, reward, his, kindness, she, planned, to, make, demophon, immortal, she, secretly, anointed, the, boy, with, ambrosia, and, laid, him, in, the, hearth, s, flames, to, gradually, burn, away, his, mortal, self, but, metanira, walked, in, saw, her, son, in, the, fire, and, screamed, in, fright, demeter, abandoned, the, attempt, instead, she, taught, triptolemus, the, secrets, of, agriculture, and, he, in, turn, taught, them, to, any, who, wished, to, learn, them, thus, humanity, learned, how, to, plant, grow, and, harvest, grain, the, myth, has, several, versions, some, are, linked, to, figures, such, as, eleusis, rarus, and, trochilus, the, demophon, element, may, be, based, on, an, earlier, folk, tale, homer, s, odyssey, c, late, 8th, century, bc, contains, perhaps, the, earliest, direct, references, to, the, myth, of, demeter, and, her, consort, iasion, a, samothracian, hero, whose, name, may, refer, to, bindweed, a, small, white, flower, that, frequently, grows, in, wheat, fields, in, the, odyssey, calypso, describes, how, demeter, without, disguise, made, love, to, iasion, so, it, was, when, demeter, of, the, braided, tresses, followed, her, heart, and, lay, in, love, with, iasion, in, the, triple, furrowed, field, zeus, was, aware, of, it, soon, enough, and, hurled, the, bright, thunderbolt, and, killed, him, however, ovid, states, that, iasion, lived, up, to, old, age, as, the, husband, of, demeter, in, ancient, greek, culture, part, of, the, opening, of, each, agricultural, year, involved, the, cutting, of, three, furrows, in, the, field, to, ensure, its, fertility, hesiod, expanded, on, the, basics, of, this, myth, according, to, him, the, liaison, between, demeter, and, iasion, took, place, at, the, wedding, of, cadmus, and, harmonia, in, crete, demeter, in, this, version, had, lured, iasion, away, from, the, other, revellers, hesiod, says, that, demeter, subsequently, gave, birth, to, plutus, in, arcadia, located, in, what, is, now, southern, greece, the, major, goddess, despoina, was, considered, the, daughter, of, demeter, and, poseidon, hippios, horse, poseidon, in, the, associated, myths, poseidon, represents, the, river, spirit, of, the, underworld, and, he, appears, as, a, horse, as, often, happens, in, northern, european, folklore, the, myth, describes, how, he, pursued, his, older, sister, demeter, who, hid, from, him, among, the, horses, of, the, king, onkios, but, even, in, the, form, of, a, mare, she, could, not, conceal, her, divinity, poseidon, caught, and, raped, his, older, sister, in, the, form, of, a, stallion, demeter, was, furious, at, poseidon, s, assault, in, this, furious, form, she, became, known, as, demeter, erinys, her, anger, at, poseidon, drove, her, to, dress, all, in, black, and, retreat, into, a, cave, to, purify, herself, an, act, which, was, the, cause, of, a, universal, famine, demeter, s, absence, caused, the, death, of, crops, livestock, and, eventually, of, the, people, who, depended, on, them, later, arcadian, tradition, held, that, it, was, both, her, rage, at, poseidon, and, her, loss, of, her, daughter, caused, the, famine, merging, the, two, myths, demeter, washed, away, her, anger, in, the, river, ladon, becoming, demeter, lousia, the, bathed, demeter, in, her, alliance, with, poseidon, ker, nyi, noted, she, was, earth, who, bears, plants, and, beasts, and, could, therefore, assume, the, shape, of, an, ear, of, grain, or, a, mare, moreover, she, bore, a, daughter, despoina, the, mistress, whose, name, should, not, be, uttered, outside, the, arcadian, mysteries, and, a, horse, named, arion, with, a, black, mane, and, tail, at, phigaleia, a, xoanon, wood, carved, statue, of, demeter, was, erected, in, a, cave, which, tradition, held, was, the, cave, into, which, black, demeter, retreated, the, statue, depicted, a, medusa, like, figure, with, a, horse, s, head, and, snake, like, hair, holding, a, dove, and, a, dolphin, which, probably, represented, her, power, over, air, and, water, the, second, mountain, mount, elaius, is, some, thirty, stades, away, from, phigalia, and, has, a, cave, sacred, to, demeter, surnamed, black, the, phigalians, say, they, concluded, that, this, cavern, was, sacred, to, demeter, and, set, up, in, it, a, wooden, image, the, image, they, say, was, made, after, this, fashion, it, was, seated, on, a, rock, like, to, a, woman, in, all, respects, save, the, head, she, had, the, head, and, hair, of, a, horse, and, there, grew, out, of, her, head, images, of, serpents, and, other, beasts, her, tunic, reached, right, to, her, feet, on, one, of, her, hands, was, a, dolphin, on, the, other, a, dove, now, why, they, had, the, image, made, after, this, fashion, is, plain, to, any, intelligent, man, who, is, learned, in, traditions, they, say, that, they, named, her, black, because, the, goddess, had, black, apparel, they, cannot, relate, either, who, made, this, wooden, image, or, how, it, caught, fire, but, the, old, image, was, destroyed, and, the, phigalians, gave, the, goddess, no, fresh, image, while, they, neglected, for, the, most, part, her, festivals, and, sacrifices, until, the, barrenness, fell, on, the, land, another, myth, involving, demeter, s, rage, resulting, in, famine, is, that, of, erysichthon, king, of, thessaly, the, myth, tells, of, erysichthon, ordering, all, of, the, trees, in, one, of, demeter, s, sacred, groves, to, be, cut, down, as, he, wanted, to, build, an, extension, of, his, palace, and, hold, feasts, there, one, tree, a, huge, oak, was, covered, with, votive, wreaths, symbols, of, the, prayers, demeter, had, granted, so, erysichthon, s, men, refused, to, cut, it, down, the, king, used, an, axe, to, cut, it, down, killing, a, dryad, nymph, in, the, process, the, nymph, s, dying, words, were, a, curse, on, erysichthon, demeter, punished, the, king, by, calling, upon, limos, the, spirit, of, unrelenting, and, insatiable, hunger, to, enter, his, stomach, the, more, the, king, ate, the, hungrier, he, became, erysichthon, sold, all, his, possessions, to, buy, food, but, was, still, hungry, finally, he, sold, his, daughter, mestra, into, slavery, mestra, was, freed, from, slavery, by, her, former, lover, poseidon, who, gave, her, the, gift, of, shape, shifting, into, any, creature, to, escape, her, bonds, erysichthon, used, her, shape, shifting, ability, to, sell, her, numerous, times, to, make, more, money, to, feed, himself, but, no, amount, of, food, was, enough, eventually, erysichthon, ate, himself, in, a, variation, erysichthon, tore, down, a, temple, of, demeter, wishing, to, build, a, roof, for, his, house, she, punished, him, the, same, way, and, near, the, end, of, his, life, she, sent, a, snake, to, plague, him, afterwards, demeter, put, him, among, the, stars, the, constellation, ophiuchus, as, she, did, the, snake, to, continue, to, inflict, its, punishment, on, erysichthon, in, the, pergamon, altar, which, depicts, the, battle, of, the, gods, against, the, giants, gigantomachy, survive, remains, of, what, seems, to, have, been, demeter, fighting, a, giant, labelled, erysichthon, demeter, is, also, depicted, fighting, against, the, giants, next, to, hermes, in, the, suessula, gigantomachy, vase, now, housed, in, the, louvre, museum, usually, ancient, depictions, of, the, gigantomachy, tend, to, exclude, demeter, due, to, her, non, martial, nature, while, travelling, far, and, wide, looking, for, her, daughter, demeter, arrived, exhausted, in, attica, a, woman, named, misme, took, her, in, and, offered, her, a, cup, of, water, with, pennyroyal, and, barley, groats, for, it, was, a, hot, day, demeter, in, her, thirst, swallowed, the, drink, clumsily, witnessing, that, misme, s, son, ascalabus, laughed, mocked, her, and, asked, her, if, she, would, like, a, deep, jar, of, that, drink, demeter, then, poured, her, drink, over, him, and, turned, him, into, a, gecko, hated, by, both, men, and, gods, it, was, said, that, demeter, showed, her, favour, to, those, who, killed, geckos, before, hades, abducted, her, daughter, he, had, kept, the, nymph, minthe, as, his, mistress, but, after, he, married, persephone, he, set, minthe, aside, minthe, would, often, brag, about, being, lovelier, than, persephone, and, say, hades, would, soon, come, back, to, her, and, kick, persephone, out, of, his, halls, demeter, hearing, that, grew, angry, and, trampled, minthe, from, the, earth, then, sprang, a, lovely, smelling, herb, named, after, the, nymph, in, other, versions, persephone, herself, is, the, one, who, kills, and, turns, minthe, into, a, plant, for, sleeping, with, hades, in, an, argive, myth, when, demeter, arrived, in, argolis, a, man, named, colontas, refused, to, receive, her, in, his, house, whereas, his, daughter, chthonia, disapproved, of, his, actions, colontas, was, punished, by, being, burnt, along, with, his, house, while, demeter, took, chthonia, to, hermione, where, she, built, a, sanctuary, for, the, goddess, demeter, pinned, ascalaphus, under, a, rock, for, reporting, as, sole, witness, to, hades, that, persephone, had, consumed, some, pomegranate, seeds, later, after, heracles, rolled, the, stone, off, ascalaphus, demeter, turned, him, into, a, short, eared, owl, instead, demeter, also, turned, the, sirens, into, half, bird, monsters, for, not, helping, her, daughter, persephone, when, she, was, abducted, by, hades, once, the, colchian, princess, medea, ended, a, famine, that, plagued, corinth, by, making, sacrifices, to, demeter, and, the, nymphs, demeter, gave, triptolemus, her, serpent, drawn, chariot, one, of, the, serpents, that, drew, this, chariot, was, kykreides, and, seed, and, bade, him, scatter, it, across, the, earth, teach, humankind, the, knowledge, of, agriculture, triptolemus, rode, through, europe, and, asia, until, he, came, to, the, land, of, lyncus, a, scythian, king, lyncus, pretended, to, offer, what, s, accustomed, of, hospitality, to, him, but, once, triptolemus, fell, asleep, he, attacked, him, with, a, dagger, wanting, to, take, credit, for, his, work, demeter, then, saved, triptolemus, by, turning, lyncus, into, a, lynx, and, ordered, triptolemus, to, return, home, airborne, hyginus, records, a, very, similar, myth, in, which, demeter, saves, triptolemus, from, an, evil, king, named, carnabon, who, additionally, seized, triptolemus, chariot, and, killed, one, of, the, dragons, so, he, might, not, escape, demeter, restored, the, chariot, to, triptolemus, substituted, the, dead, dragon, with, another, one, and, punished, carnabon, by, putting, him, among, the, stars, holding, a, dragon, as, if, to, kill, it, during, her, wanderings, demeter, came, upon, the, town, of, pheneus, to, the, pheneates, that, received, her, warmly, and, offered, her, shelter, she, gave, all, sorts, of, pulse, except, for, beans, deeming, it, impure, two, of, the, pheneates, trisaules, and, damithales, had, a, temple, of, demeter, built, for, her, demeter, also, gifted, a, fig, tree, to, phytalus, an, eleusinian, man, for, welcoming, her, in, his, home, in, the, tale, of, eros, and, psyche, demeter, along, with, her, sister, hera, visited, aphrodite, raging, with, fury, about, the, girl, who, had, married, her, son, aphrodite, asks, the, two, to, search, for, her, the, two, try, to, talk, sense, into, her, arguing, that, her, son, is, not, a, little, boy, although, he, might, appear, as, one, and, there, s, no, harm, in, him, falling, in, love, with, psyche, aphrodite, took, offence, at, their, words, sometime, later, psyche, in, her, wanderings, came, across, an, abandoned, shrine, of, demeter, and, sorted, out, the, neglected, sickles, and, harvest, implements, she, found, there, as, she, was, doing, so, demeter, appeared, to, her, and, called, from, afar, she, warned, the, girl, of, aphrodite, s, great, wrath, and, her, plan, to, take, revenge, on, her, then, psyche, begged, the, goddess, to, help, her, but, demeter, answered, that, she, could, not, interfere, and, incur, aphrodite, s, anger, at, her, and, for, that, reason, psyche, had, to, leave, the, shrine, or, else, be, kept, as, a, captive, of, hers, when, her, son, philomelus, invented, the, plough, and, used, it, to, cultivate, the, fields, demeter, was, so, impressed, by, his, good, work, that, she, immortalized, him, in, the, sky, by, turning, him, into, a, constellation, the, bo, tes, hierax, a, man, of, justice, and, distinction, set, up, sanctuaries, for, demeter, and, received, plenteous, harvests, from, her, in, return, when, the, tribe, neglected, poseidon, favour, of, demeter, the, sea, god, destroyed, all, of, her, crops, so, hierax, sent, them, instead, his, own, food, and, was, transformed, into, a, hawk, by, poseidon, besides, giving, gifts, to, those, who, were, welcoming, to, her, demeter, was, also, a, goddess, who, nursed, the, young, all, of, plemaeus, s, children, born, by, his, first, wife, died, in, a, cradle, demeter, took, pity, on, him, and, reared, herself, his, son, orthopolis, plemaeus, built, a, temple, to, her, to, thank, her, demeter, also, raised, trophonius, the, prophetic, son, of, either, apollo, or, erginus, demeter, seems, to, have, accompanied, dionysus, when, he, descended, into, the, underworld, to, retrieve, his, mother, semele, in, order, to, visit, her, now, married, daughter, and, perhaps, lead, her, back, to, the, land, of, the, living, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, in, many, vases, from, athens, dionysus, is, seen, in, the, company, of, mother, and, daughter, once, tantalus, a, son, of, zeus, invited, the, gods, over, for, dinner, tantalus, wanting, to, test, them, cut, his, son, pelops, cooked, him, and, offered, him, as, a, meal, to, them, they, all, saw, through, tantalus, crime, except, demeter, who, ate, pelops, shoulder, before, the, gods, brought, him, back, to, life
