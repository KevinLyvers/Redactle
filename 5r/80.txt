https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms
in, philosophy, and, specifically, metaphysics, the, theory, of, forms, theory, of, ideas, platonic, idealism, or, platonic, realism, is, a, theory, widely, credited, to, the, classical, greek, philosopher, plato, the, theory, suggests, that, the, physical, world, is, not, as, real, or, true, as, forms, according, to, this, theory, forms, conventionally, capitalized, and, also, commonly, translated, as, ideas, are, the, non, physical, timeless, absolute, and, unchangeable, essences, of, all, things, of, which, objects, and, matter, in, the, physical, world, are, merely, imitations, plato, speaks, of, these, entities, only, through, the, characters, primarily, socrates, in, his, dialogues, who, sometimes, suggest, that, these, forms, are, the, only, objects, of, study, that, can, provide, knowledge, scriptures, written, by, pythagoras, suggest, that, he, developed, a, similar, theory, earlier, than, plato, with, pythagoras, s, theory, specifically, proposing, that, the, world, is, entirely, composed, of, numbers, the, early, greek, concept, of, form, precedes, attested, philosophical, usage, and, is, represented, by, a, number, of, words, which, mainly, relate, to, vision, sight, and, appearance, plato, uses, these, aspects, of, sight, and, appearance, from, the, early, greek, concept, in, his, dialogues, to, explain, his, forms, including, the, form, of, the, good, the, theory, itself, is, contested, by, characters, within, plato, s, dialogues, and, it, remains, a, general, point, of, controversy, in, philosophy, nonetheless, it, is, considered, to, be, a, classical, solution, to, the, problem, of, universals, the, original, meaning, of, the, term, e, dos, visible, form, and, related, terms, morph, shape, and, phain, mena, appearances, from, pha, n, shine, indo, european, b, eh, or, bh, remained, stable, over, the, centuries, until, the, beginning, of, western, philosophy, when, they, became, equivocal, acquiring, additional, specialized, philosophic, meanings, plato, used, the, terms, eidos, and, idea, interchangeably, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, starting, with, thales, noted, that, appearances, change, and, began, to, ask, what, the, thing, that, changes, really, is, the, answer, was, substance, which, stands, under, the, changes, and, is, the, actually, existing, thing, being, seen, the, status, of, appearances, now, came, into, question, what, is, the, form, really, and, how, is, that, related, to, substance, the, forms, are, expounded, upon, in, plato, s, dialogues, and, general, speech, in, that, every, object, or, quality, in, reality, dogs, human, beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and, goodness, has, a, form, form, answers, the, question, what, is, that, plato, was, going, a, step, further, and, asking, what, form, itself, is, he, supposed, that, the, object, was, essentially, or, really, the, form, and, that, the, phenomena, were, mere, shadows, mimicking, the, form, that, is, momentary, portrayals, of, the, form, under, different, circumstances, the, problem, of, universals, how, can, one, thing, in, general, be, many, things, in, particular, was, solved, by, presuming, that, form, was, a, distinct, singular, thing, but, caused, plural, representations, of, itself, in, particular, objects, for, example, in, the, dialogue, parmenides, socrates, states, nor, again, if, a, person, were, to, show, that, all, is, one, by, partaking, of, one, and, at, the, same, time, many, by, partaking, of, many, would, that, be, very, astonishing, but, if, he, were, to, show, me, that, the, absolute, one, was, many, or, the, absolute, many, one, i, should, be, truly, amazed, 129, matter, is, considered, particular, in, itself, for, plato, forms, such, as, beauty, are, more, real, than, any, objects, that, imitate, them, though, the, forms, are, timeless, and, unchanging, physical, things, are, in, a, constant, change, of, existence, where, forms, are, unqualified, perfection, physical, things, are, qualified, and, conditioned, these, forms, are, the, essences, of, various, objects, they, are, that, without, which, a, thing, would, not, be, the, kind, of, thing, it, is, for, example, there, are, countless, tables, in, the, world, but, the, form, of, tableness, is, at, the, core, it, is, the, essence, of, all, of, them, plato, s, socrates, held, that, the, world, of, forms, is, transcendent, to, our, own, world, the, world, of, substances, and, also, is, the, essential, basis, of, reality, super, ordinate, to, matter, forms, are, the, most, pure, of, all, things, furthermore, he, believed, that, true, knowledge, intelligence, is, the, ability, to, grasp, the, world, of, forms, with, one, s, mind, a, form, is, aspatial, transcendent, to, space, and, atemporal, transcendent, to, time, in, the, world, of, plato, atemporal, means, that, it, does, not, exist, within, any, time, period, rather, it, provides, the, formal, basis, for, time, it, therefore, formally, grounds, beginning, persisting, and, ending, it, is, neither, eternal, in, the, sense, of, existing, forever, nor, mortal, of, limited, duration, it, exists, transcendent, to, time, altogether, forms, are, aspatial, in, that, they, have, no, spatial, dimensions, and, thus, no, orientation, in, space, nor, do, they, even, like, the, point, have, a, location, they, are, non, physical, but, they, are, not, in, the, mind, forms, are, extra, mental, i, e, real, in, the, strictest, sense, of, the, word, a, form, is, an, objective, blueprint, of, perfection, the, forms, are, perfect, and, unchanging, representations, of, objects, and, qualities, for, example, the, form, of, beauty, or, the, form, of, a, triangle, for, the, form, of, a, triangle, say, there, is, a, triangle, drawn, on, a, blackboard, a, triangle, is, a, polygon, with, 3, sides, the, triangle, as, it, is, on, the, blackboard, is, far, from, perfect, however, it, is, only, the, intelligibility, of, the, form, triangle, that, allows, us, to, know, the, drawing, on, the, chalkboard, is, a, triangle, and, the, form, triangle, is, perfect, and, unchanging, it, is, exactly, the, same, whenever, anyone, chooses, to, consider, it, however, time, only, affects, the, observer, and, not, the, triangle, it, follows, that, the, same, attributes, would, exist, for, the, form, of, beauty, and, for, all, forms, plato, explains, how, we, are, always, many, steps, away, from, the, idea, or, form, the, idea, of, a, perfect, circle, can, have, us, defining, speaking, writing, and, drawing, about, particular, circles, that, are, always, steps, away, from, the, actual, being, the, perfect, circle, partly, represented, by, a, curved, line, and, a, precise, definition, cannot, be, drawn, even, the, ratio, of, pi, is, an, irrational, number, that, only, partly, helps, to, fully, describe, the, perfect, circle, the, idea, of, the, perfect, circle, is, discovered, not, invented, plato, often, invokes, particularly, in, his, dialogues, phaedo, republic, and, phaedrus, poetic, language, to, illustrate, the, mode, in, which, the, forms, are, said, to, exist, near, the, end, of, the, phaedo, for, example, plato, describes, the, world, of, forms, as, a, pristine, region, of, the, physical, universe, located, above, the, surface, of, the, earth, phd, 109a, 111c, in, the, phaedrus, the, forms, are, in, a, place, beyond, heaven, hyperouranios, topos, phdr, 247c, ff, and, in, the, republic, the, sensible, world, is, contrasted, with, the, intelligible, realm, no, ton, topon, in, the, famous, allegory, of, the, cave, it, would, be, a, mistake, to, take, plato, s, imagery, as, positing, the, intelligible, world, as, a, literal, physical, space, apart, from, this, one, plato, emphasizes, that, the, forms, are, not, beings, that, extend, in, space, or, time, but, subsist, apart, from, any, physical, space, whatsoever, thus, we, read, in, the, symposium, of, the, form, of, beauty, it, is, not, anywhere, in, another, thing, as, in, an, animal, or, in, earth, or, in, heaven, or, in, anything, else, but, itself, by, itself, with, itself, 211b, and, in, the, timaeus, plato, writes, since, these, things, are, so, we, must, agree, that, that, which, keeps, its, own, form, unchangingly, which, has, not, been, brought, into, being, and, is, not, destroyed, which, neither, receives, into, itself, anything, else, from, anywhere, else, nor, itself, enters, into, anything, anywhere, is, one, thing, 52a, emphasis, added, plato, s, conception, of, forms, actually, differs, from, dialogue, to, dialogue, and, in, certain, respects, it, is, never, fully, explained, so, many, aspects, of, the, theory, are, open, to, interpretation, forms, are, first, introduced, in, the, phaedo, but, in, that, dialogue, the, concept, is, simply, referred, to, as, something, the, participants, are, already, familiar, with, and, the, theory, itself, is, not, developed, similarly, in, the, republic, plato, relies, on, the, concept, of, forms, as, the, basis, of, many, of, his, arguments, but, feels, no, need, to, argue, for, the, validity, of, the, theory, itself, or, to, explain, precisely, what, forms, are, commentators, have, been, left, with, the, task, of, explaining, what, forms, are, and, how, visible, objects, participate, in, them, and, there, has, been, no, shortage, of, disagreement, some, scholars, advance, the, view, that, forms, are, paradigms, perfect, examples, on, which, the, imperfect, world, is, modeled, others, interpret, forms, as, universals, so, that, the, form, of, beauty, for, example, is, that, quality, that, all, beautiful, things, share, yet, others, interpret, forms, as, stuffs, the, conglomeration, of, all, instances, of, a, quality, in, the, visible, world, under, this, interpretation, we, could, say, there, is, a, little, beauty, in, one, person, a, little, beauty, in, another, all, the, beauty, in, the, world, put, together, is, the, form, of, beauty, plato, himself, was, aware, of, the, ambiguities, and, inconsistencies, in, his, theory, of, forms, as, is, evident, from, the, incisive, criticism, he, makes, of, his, own, theory, in, the, parmenides, in, cratylus, plato, writes, but, if, the, very, nature, of, knowledge, changes, at, the, time, when, the, change, occurs, there, will, be, no, knowledge, and, according, to, this, view, there, will, be, no, one, to, know, and, nothing, to, be, known, but, if, that, which, knows, and, that, which, is, known, exist, ever, and, the, beautiful, and, the, good, and, every, other, thing, also, exist, then, i, do, not, think, that, they, can, resemble, a, process, of, flux, as, we, were, just, now, supposing, plato, believed, that, long, before, our, bodies, ever, existed, our, souls, existed, and, inhabited, heaven, where, they, became, directly, acquainted, with, the, forms, themselves, real, knowledge, to, him, was, knowledge, of, the, forms, but, knowledge, of, the, forms, cannot, be, gained, through, sensory, experience, because, the, forms, are, not, in, the, physical, world, therefore, our, real, knowledge, of, the, forms, must, be, the, memory, of, our, initial, acquaintance, with, the, forms, in, heaven, therefore, what, we, seem, to, learn, is, in, fact, just, remembering, no, one, has, ever, seen, a, perfect, circle, nor, a, perfectly, straight, line, yet, everyone, knows, what, a, circle, and, a, straight, line, are, plato, uses, the, tool, maker, s, blueprint, as, evidence, that, forms, are, real, when, a, man, has, discovered, the, instrument, which, is, naturally, adapted, to, each, work, he, must, express, this, natural, form, and, not, others, which, he, fancies, in, the, material, perceived, circles, or, lines, are, not, exactly, circular, or, straight, and, true, circles, and, lines, could, never, be, detected, since, by, definition, they, are, sets, of, infinitely, small, points, but, if, the, perfect, ones, were, not, real, how, could, they, direct, the, manufacturer, one, difficulty, lies, in, the, conceptualization, of, the, participation, of, an, object, in, a, form, or, form, the, young, socrates, conceives, of, his, solution, to, the, problem, of, the, universals, in, another, metaphor, nay, but, the, idea, may, be, like, the, day, which, is, one, and, the, same, in, many, places, at, once, and, yet, continuous, with, itself, in, this, way, each, idea, may, be, one, and, the, same, in, all, at, the, same, time, but, exactly, how, is, a, form, like, the, day, in, being, everywhere, at, once, the, solution, calls, for, a, distinct, form, in, which, the, particular, instances, which, are, not, identical, to, the, form, participate, i, e, the, form, is, shared, out, somehow, like, the, day, to, many, places, the, concept, of, participate, represented, in, greek, by, more, than, one, word, is, as, obscure, in, greek, as, it, is, in, english, plato, hypothesized, that, distinctness, meant, existence, as, an, independent, being, thus, opening, himself, to, the, famous, third, man, argument, of, parmenides, which, proves, that, forms, cannot, independently, exist, and, be, participated, if, universal, and, particulars, say, man, or, greatness, all, exist, and, are, the, same, then, the, form, is, not, one, but, is, multiple, if, they, are, only, like, each, other, then, they, contain, a, form, that, is, the, same, and, others, that, are, different, thus, if, we, presume, that, the, form, and, a, particular, are, alike, then, there, must, be, another, or, third, form, man, or, greatness, by, possession, of, which, they, are, alike, an, infinite, regression, would, then, result, that, is, an, endless, series, of, third, men, the, ultimate, participant, greatness, rendering, the, entire, series, great, is, missing, moreover, any, form, is, not, unitary, but, is, composed, of, infinite, parts, none, of, which, is, the, proper, form, the, young, socrates, did, not, give, up, the, theory, of, forms, over, the, third, man, but, took, another, tack, that, the, particulars, do, not, exist, as, such, whatever, they, are, they, mime, the, forms, appearing, to, be, particulars, this, is, a, clear, dip, into, representationalism, that, we, cannot, observe, the, objects, as, they, are, in, themselves, but, only, their, representations, that, view, has, the, weakness, that, if, only, the, mimes, can, be, observed, then, the, real, forms, cannot, be, known, at, all, and, the, observer, can, have, no, idea, of, what, the, representations, are, supposed, to, represent, or, that, they, are, representations, socrates, later, answer, would, be, that, men, already, know, the, forms, because, they, were, in, the, world, of, forms, before, birth, the, mimes, only, recall, these, forms, to, memory, the, topic, of, aristotle, s, criticism, of, plato, s, theory, of, forms, is, a, large, one, and, continues, to, expand, rather, than, quote, plato, aristotle, often, summarized, classical, commentaries, thus, recommended, aristotle, as, an, introduction, to, plato, even, when, in, disagreement, the, platonist, syrianus, used, aristotelian, critiques, to, further, refine, the, platonic, position, on, forms, in, use, in, his, school, a, position, handed, down, to, his, student, proclus, as, a, historian, of, prior, thought, aristotle, was, invaluable, however, this, was, secondary, to, his, own, dialectic, and, in, some, cases, he, treats, purported, implications, as, if, plato, had, actually, mentioned, them, or, even, defended, them, in, examining, aristotle, s, criticism, of, the, forms, it, is, helpful, to, understand, aristotle, s, own, hylomorphic, forms, by, which, he, intends, to, salvage, much, of, plato, s, theory, plato, distinguished, between, real, and, non, real, existing, things, where, the, latter, term, is, used, of, substance, the, figures, that, the, artificer, places, in, the, gold, are, not, substance, but, gold, is, aristotle, stated, that, for, plato, all, things, studied, by, the, sciences, have, form, and, asserted, that, plato, considered, only, substance, to, have, form, uncharitably, this, leads, him, to, something, like, a, contradiction, forms, existing, as, the, objects, of, science, but, not, existing, as, substance, scottish, philosopher, w, d, ross, objects, to, this, as, a, mischaracterization, of, plato, plato, did, not, claim, to, know, where, the, line, between, form, and, non, form, is, to, be, drawn, as, cornford, points, out, those, things, about, which, the, young, socrates, and, plato, asserted, i, have, often, been, puzzled, about, these, things, in, reference, to, man, fire, and, water, appear, as, forms, in, later, works, however, others, do, not, such, as, hair, mud, dirt, of, these, socrates, is, made, to, assert, it, would, be, too, absurd, to, suppose, that, they, have, a, form, ross, also, objects, to, aristotle, s, criticism, that, form, otherness, accounts, for, the, differences, between, forms, and, purportedly, leads, to, contradictory, forms, the, not, tall, the, not, beautiful, etc, that, particulars, participate, in, a, form, is, for, aristotle, much, too, vague, to, permit, analysis, by, one, way, in, which, he, unpacks, the, concept, the, forms, would, cease, to, be, of, one, essence, due, to, any, multiple, participation, as, ross, indicates, plato, didn, t, make, that, leap, from, a, is, not, b, to, a, is, not, b, otherness, would, only, apply, to, its, own, particulars, and, not, to, those, of, other, forms, for, example, there, is, no, form, not, greek, only, particulars, of, form, otherness, that, somehow, suppress, form, greek, regardless, of, whether, socrates, meant, the, particulars, of, otherness, yield, not, greek, not, tall, not, beautiful, etc, the, particulars, would, operate, specifically, rather, than, generally, each, somehow, yielding, only, one, exclusion, plato, had, postulated, that, we, know, forms, through, a, remembrance, of, the, soul, s, past, lives, and, aristotle, s, arguments, against, this, treatment, of, epistemology, are, compelling, for, plato, particulars, somehow, do, not, exist, and, on, the, face, of, it, that, which, is, non, existent, cannot, be, known, see, metaphysics, iii, 3, 4, nominalism, from, latin, nomen, name, says, that, ideal, universals, are, mere, names, human, creations, the, blueness, shared, by, sky, and, blue, jeans, is, a, shared, concept, communicated, by, our, word, blueness, blueness, is, held, not, to, have, any, existence, beyond, that, which, it, has, in, instances, of, blue, things, this, concept, arose, in, the, middle, ages, as, part, of, scholasticism, scholasticism, was, a, highly, multinational, polyglottal, school, of, philosophy, and, the, nominalist, argument, may, be, more, obvious, if, an, example, is, given, in, more, than, one, language, for, instance, colour, terms, are, strongly, variable, by, language, some, languages, consider, blue, and, green, the, same, colour, others, have, monolexemic, terms, for, several, shades, of, blue, which, are, considered, different, other, languages, like, the, mandarin, qing, denote, both, blue, and, black, the, german, word, stift, means, a, pen, or, a, pencil, and, also, anything, of, the, same, shape, the, english, pencil, originally, meant, small, paintbrush, the, term, later, included, the, silver, rod, used, for, silverpoint, the, german, blei, stift, and, silber, stift, can, both, be, called, stift, but, this, term, also, includes, felt, tip, pens, which, are, clearly, not, pencils, the, shifting, and, overlapping, nature, of, these, concepts, makes, it, easy, to, imagine, them, as, mere, names, with, meanings, not, rigidly, defined, but, specific, enough, to, be, useful, for, communication, given, a, group, of, objects, how, is, one, to, decide, if, it, contains, only, instances, of, a, single, form, or, several, mutually, exclusive, forms, the, theory, is, presented, in, the, following, dialogues
