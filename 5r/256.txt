jainism, d, e, n, z, m, jay, niz, m, also, known, as, jain, dharma, is, an, indian, religion, jainism, traces, its, spiritual, ideas, and, history, through, the, succession, of, twenty, four, tirthankara, s, supreme, preachers, of, dharma, with, the, first, in, the, current, time, cycle, being, rishabhadeva, whom, the, tradition, holds, to, have, lived, millions, of, years, ago, the, twenty, third, tirthankara, parshvanatha, whom, historians, date, to, the, 9th, century, bce, and, the, twenty, fourth, tirthankara, mahavira, around, 600, bce, jainism, is, considered, an, eternal, dharma, with, the, tirthankaras, guiding, every, time, cycle, of, the, cosmology, the, three, main, pillars, of, jainism, are, ahi, s, non, violence, anek, ntav, da, non, absolutism, and, aparigraha, asceticism, jain, monks, take, five, main, vows, ahi, s, non, violence, satya, truth, asteya, not, stealing, brahmacharya, chastity, and, aparigraha, non, possessiveness, these, principles, have, affected, jain, culture, in, many, ways, such, as, leading, to, a, predominantly, lacto, vegetarian, lifestyle, parasparopagraho, j, v, n, m, the, function, of, souls, is, to, help, one, another, is, the, faith, s, motto, and, the, namokar, mantra, is, its, most, common, and, strongest, prayer, jainism, is, one, of, the, oldest, religions, still, practiced, today, it, has, two, major, ancient, sub, traditions, digambaras, and, v, t, mbaras, which, hold, different, views, on, ascetic, practices, gender, and, the, texts, considered, canonical, both, sub, traditions, have, mendicants, supported, by, laypersons, r, vakas, and, r, vikas, the, v, t, mbara, tradition, in, turn, has, two, sub, traditions, deravasi, also, known, as, mandirmargis, and, sth, nakavas, the, religion, has, between, four, and, five, million, followers, known, as, jains, or, jainas, who, reside, mostly, in, india, where, they, numbered, around, 4, 5, million, at, the, 2011, census, outside, india, some, of, the, largest, jain, communities, can, be, found, in, canada, europe, and, the, united, states, japan, is, also, home, to, a, fast, growing, community, of, converts, major, festivals, include, paryushana, and, das, lakshana, ashtanika, mahavir, janma, kalyanak, akshaya, tritiya, and, dipawali, jainism, is, transtheistic, and, forecasts, that, the, universe, evolves, without, violating, the, law, of, substance, dualism, and, the, actual, realization, of, this, principle, plays, out, through, the, phenomena, of, both, parallelism, and, interactionism, dravya, means, substances, or, entity, in, sanskrit, jains, believe, the, universe, is, made, up, of, six, eternal, substances, sentient, beings, or, souls, j, va, non, sentient, substance, or, matter, pudgala, the, principle, of, motion, dharma, the, principle, of, rest, adharma, space, k, a, and, time, k, la, the, last, five, are, united, as, the, ajiva, non, living, jains, distinguish, a, substance, from, a, complex, body, or, thing, by, declaring, the, former, a, simple, indestructible, element, while, the, latter, is, a, compound, made, of, one, or, more, substances, that, can, be, destroyed, tattva, connotes, reality, or, truth, in, jain, philosophy, and, is, the, framework, for, salvation, according, to, digambara, jains, there, are, seven, tattvas, the, sentient, jiva, or, living, the, insentient, ajiva, or, non, living, the, karmic, influx, to, the, soul, srava, which, is, a, mix, of, living, and, non, living, the, bondage, of, karmic, particles, to, the, soul, bandha, the, stoppage, of, karmic, particles, sa, vara, the, wiping, away, of, past, karmic, particles, nirjar, and, the, liberation, moksha, v, t, mbaras, add, two, further, tattvas, namely, good, karma, punya, and, bad, karma, paapa, the, true, insight, in, jain, philosophy, is, considered, as, faith, in, the, tattvas, the, spiritual, goal, in, jainism, is, to, reach, moksha, for, ascetics, but, for, most, jain, laypersons, it, is, to, accumulate, good, karma, that, leads, to, better, rebirth, and, a, step, closer, to, liberation, jain, philosophy, accepts, three, reliable, means, of, knowledge, pramana, it, holds, that, correct, knowledge, is, based, on, perception, pratyaksa, inference, anumana, and, testimony, sabda, or, the, word, of, scriptures, these, ideas, are, elaborated, in, jain, texts, such, as, tattvarthas, tra, parvacanasara, nandi, and, anuyogadvarini, some, jain, texts, add, analogy, upamana, as, the, fourth, reliable, means, in, a, manner, similar, to, epistemological, theories, found, in, other, indian, religions, in, jainism, jn, na, knowledge, is, said, to, be, of, five, kinds, mati, j, na, sensory, knowledge, rutu, j, na, scriptural, knowledge, avadhi, j, na, clairvoyance, manah, pray, ya, j, na, telepathy, and, kevala, jnana, omniscience, according, to, the, jain, text, tattvartha, s, tra, the, first, two, are, indirect, knowledge, and, the, remaining, three, are, direct, knowledge, according, to, jainism, the, existence, of, a, bound, and, ever, changing, soul, is, a, self, evident, truth, an, axiom, which, does, not, need, to, be, proven, it, maintains, that, there, are, numerous, souls, but, every, one, of, them, has, three, qualities, gu, a, consciousness, chaitanya, the, most, important, bliss, sukha, and, vibrational, energy, virya, it, further, claims, the, vibration, draws, karmic, particles, to, the, soul, and, creates, bondages, but, is, also, what, adds, merit, or, demerit, to, the, soul, jain, texts, state, that, souls, exist, as, clothed, with, material, bodies, where, it, entirely, fills, up, the, body, karma, as, in, other, indian, religions, connotes, in, jainism, the, universal, cause, and, effect, law, however, it, is, envisioned, as, a, material, substance, subtle, matter, that, can, bind, to, the, soul, travel, with, the, soul, in, bound, form, between, rebirths, and, affect, the, suffering, and, happiness, experienced, by, the, jiva, in, the, lokas, karma, is, believed, to, obscure, and, obstruct, the, innate, nature, and, striving, of, the, soul, as, well, as, its, spiritual, potential, in, the, next, rebirth, the, conceptual, framework, of, the, sa, s, ra, doctrine, differs, between, jainism, and, other, indian, religions, soul, jiva, is, accepted, as, a, truth, as, in, hinduism, but, not, buddhism, the, cycle, of, rebirths, has, a, definite, beginning, and, end, in, jainism, jain, theosophy, asserts, that, each, soul, passes, through, 8, 400, 000, birth, situations, as, they, circle, through, sa, s, ra, going, through, five, types, of, bodies, earth, bodies, water, bodies, fire, bodies, air, bodies, and, vegetable, lives, constantly, changing, with, all, human, and, non, human, activities, from, rainfall, to, breathing, harming, any, life, form, is, a, sin, in, jainism, with, negative, karmic, effects, jainism, states, that, souls, begin, in, a, primordial, state, and, either, evolve, to, a, higher, state, or, regress, if, driven, by, their, karma, it, further, clarifies, that, abhavya, incapable, souls, can, never, attain, moksha, liberation, it, explains, that, the, abhavya, state, is, entered, after, an, intentional, and, shockingly, evil, act, souls, can, be, good, or, evil, in, jainism, unlike, the, nondualism, of, some, forms, of, hinduism, and, buddhism, according, to, jainism, a, siddha, liberated, soul, has, gone, beyond, sa, s, ra, is, at, the, apex, is, omniscient, and, remains, there, eternally, jain, texts, propound, that, the, universe, consists, of, many, eternal, lokas, realms, of, existence, as, in, buddhism, and, hinduism, both, time, and, the, universe, are, eternal, but, the, universe, is, transient, the, universe, body, matter, and, time, are, considered, separate, from, the, soul, jiva, their, interaction, explains, life, living, death, and, rebirth, in, jain, philosophy, the, jain, cosmic, universe, has, three, parts, the, upper, middle, and, lower, worlds, urdhva, loka, madhya, loka, and, adho, loka, jainism, states, that, k, la, time, is, without, beginning, and, eternal, the, cosmic, wheel, of, time, k, lachakra, rotates, ceaselessly, in, this, part, of, the, universe, it, explains, there, are, six, periods, of, time, within, two, eons, ara, and, in, the, first, eon, the, universe, generates, and, in, the, next, it, degenerates, thus, it, divides, the, worldly, cycle, of, time, into, two, half, cycles, utsarpi, ascending, progressive, prosperity, and, happiness, and, avasarpi, descending, increasing, sorrow, and, immorality, it, states, that, the, world, is, currently, in, the, fifth, ara, of, avasarpi, full, of, sorrow, and, religious, decline, where, the, height, of, living, beings, shrinks, according, to, jainism, after, the, sixth, ara, the, universe, will, be, reawakened, in, a, new, cycle, jainism, is, a, transtheistic, religion, holding, that, the, universe, was, not, created, and, will, exist, forever, it, is, independent, having, no, creator, governor, judge, or, destroyer, in, this, it, is, unlike, the, abrahamic, religions, and, the, theistic, strands, of, hinduism, but, similar, to, buddhism, however, jainism, believes, in, the, world, of, heavenly, and, hellish, beings, who, are, born, die, and, are, reborn, like, earthly, beings, the, souls, who, live, happily, in, the, body, of, a, heavenly, celestial, do, so, because, of, their, positive, karma, it, is, further, stated, that, they, possess, a, more, transcendent, knowledge, about, material, things, and, can, anticipate, events, in, the, human, realms, however, once, their, past, karmic, merit, is, exhausted, it, is, explained, that, their, souls, are, reborn, again, as, humans, animals, or, other, beings, the, perfect, enlightened, souls, with, a, body, are, called, arihants, victors, and, perfect, souls, without, a, body, are, called, siddhas, liberated, souls, only, a, soul, with, human, body, can, attain, enlightenment, and, liberation, the, liberated, beings, are, the, supreme, beings, and, are, worshipped, by, all, heavenly, earthly, and, hellish, beings, who, aspire, to, attain, liberation, themselves, purification, of, soul, and, liberation, can, be, achieved, through, the, path, of, three, jewels, samyak, dar, ana, correct, view, meaning, faith, acceptance, of, the, truth, of, soul, j, va, samyak, gyana, correct, knowledge, meaning, undoubting, knowledge, of, the, tattvas, and, samyak, charitra, correct, conduct, meaning, behavior, consistent, with, the, five, vows, jain, texts, often, add, samyak, tapas, correct, asceticism, as, a, fourth, jewel, emphasizing, belief, in, ascetic, practices, as, the, means, to, liberation, moksha, the, four, jewels, are, called, moksha, marga, the, path, of, liberation, the, principle, of, ahimsa, non, violence, or, non, injury, is, a, fundamental, tenet, of, jainism, it, holds, that, one, must, abandon, all, violent, activity, and, that, without, such, a, commitment, to, non, violence, all, religious, behavior, is, worthless, in, jain, theology, it, does, not, matter, how, correct, or, defensible, the, violence, may, be, one, must, not, kill, or, harm, any, being, and, non, violence, is, the, highest, religious, duty, jain, texts, such, as, c, r, ga, s, tra, and, tattvarthas, tra, state, that, one, must, renounce, all, killing, of, living, beings, whether, tiny, or, large, movable, or, immovable, its, theology, teaches, that, one, must, neither, kill, another, living, being, nor, cause, another, to, kill, nor, consent, to, any, killing, directly, or, indirectly, furthermore, jainism, emphasizes, non, violence, against, all, beings, not, only, in, action, but, also, in, speech, and, in, thought, it, states, that, instead, of, hate, or, violence, against, anyone, all, living, creatures, must, help, each, other, jains, believe, that, violence, negatively, affects, and, destroys, one, s, soul, particularly, when, the, violence, is, done, with, intent, hate, or, carelessness, or, when, one, indirectly, causes, or, consents, to, the, killing, of, a, human, or, non, human, living, being, the, doctrine, exists, in, hinduism, and, buddhism, but, is, most, highly, developed, in, jainism, the, theological, basis, of, non, violence, as, the, highest, religious, duty, has, been, interpreted, by, some, jain, scholars, not, to, be, driven, by, merit, from, giving, or, compassion, to, other, creatures, nor, a, duty, to, rescue, all, creatures, but, resulting, from, continual, self, discipline, a, cleansing, of, the, soul, that, leads, to, one, s, own, spiritual, development, which, ultimately, affects, one, s, salvation, and, release, from, rebirths, jains, believe, that, causing, injury, to, any, being, in, any, form, creates, bad, karma, which, affects, one, s, rebirth, future, well, being, and, causes, suffering, late, medieval, jain, scholars, re, examined, the, ahi, s, doctrine, when, faced, with, external, threat, or, violence, for, example, they, justified, violence, by, monks, to, protect, nuns, according, to, dundas, the, jain, scholar, jinadattasuri, wrote, during, a, time, of, destruction, of, temples, and, persecution, that, anybody, engaged, in, a, religious, activity, who, was, forced, to, fight, and, kill, somebody, would, not, lose, any, spiritual, merit, but, instead, attain, deliverance, however, examples, in, jain, texts, that, condone, fighting, and, killing, under, certain, circumstances, are, relatively, rare, the, second, main, principle, of, jainism, is, anek, ntav, da, from, anek, nta, many, sidedness, and, vada, doctrine, the, doctrine, states, that, truth, and, reality, are, complex, and, always, have, multiple, aspects, it, further, states, that, reality, can, be, experienced, but, cannot, be, fully, expressed, with, language, it, suggests, that, human, attempts, to, communicate, are, naya, partial, expression, of, the, truth, according, to, it, one, can, experience, the, taste, of, truth, but, cannot, fully, express, that, taste, through, language, it, holds, that, attempts, to, express, experience, are, sy, t, or, valid, in, some, respect, but, remain, perhaps, just, one, perspective, incomplete, it, concludes, that, in, the, same, way, spiritual, truths, can, be, experienced, but, not, fully, expressed, it, suggests, that, the, great, error, is, belief, in, ek, nta, one, sidedness, where, some, relative, truth, is, treated, as, absolute, the, doctrine, is, ancient, found, in, buddhist, texts, such, as, the, sama, aphala, sutta, the, jain, agamas, suggest, that, mah, v, ra, s, approach, to, answering, all, metaphysical, philosophical, questions, was, a, qualified, yes, sy, t, these, texts, identify, anek, ntav, da, as, a, key, difference, from, the, buddha, s, teachings, the, buddha, taught, the, middle, way, rejecting, extremes, of, the, answer, it, is, or, it, is, not, to, metaphysical, questions, the, mah, v, ra, in, contrast, taught, his, followers, to, accept, both, it, is, and, it, is, not, qualified, with, perhaps, to, understand, absolute, reality, the, permanent, being, is, conceptualized, as, jiva, soul, and, ajiva, matter, within, a, dualistic, anek, ntav, da, framework, according, to, paul, dundas, in, contemporary, times, the, anek, ntav, da, doctrine, has, been, interpreted, by, some, jains, as, intending, to, promote, a, universal, religious, tolerance, and, a, teaching, of, plurality, and, benign, attitude, to, other, positions, dundas, states, this, is, a, misreading, of, historical, texts, and, mah, v, ra, s, teachings, according, to, him, the, many, pointedness, multiple, perspective, teachings, of, the, mah, v, ra, is, about, the, nature, of, absolute, reality, and, human, existence, he, claims, that, it, is, not, about, condoning, activities, such, as, killing, animals, for, food, nor, violence, against, disbelievers, or, any, other, living, being, as, perhaps, right, the, five, vows, for, jain, monks, and, nuns, for, example, are, strict, requirements, and, there, is, no, perhaps, about, them, similarly, since, ancient, times, jainism, co, existed, with, buddhism, and, hinduism, according, to, dundas, but, jainism, disagreed, in, specific, areas, with, the, knowledge, systems, and, beliefs, of, these, traditions, and, vice, versa, the, third, main, principle, in, jainism, is, aparigraha, which, means, non, attachment, to, worldly, possessions, for, monks, and, nuns, jainism, requires, a, vow, of, complete, non, possession, of, any, property, relations, and, emotions, the, ascetic, is, a, wandering, mendicant, in, the, digambara, tradition, or, a, resident, mendicant, in, the, v, t, mbara, tradition, for, jain, laypersons, it, recommends, limited, possession, of, property, that, has, been, honestly, earned, and, giving, excess, property, to, charity, according, to, natubhai, shah, aparigraha, applies, to, both, the, material, and, the, psychic, material, possessions, refer, to, various, forms, of, property, psychic, possessions, refer, to, emotions, likes, and, dislikes, and, attachments, of, any, form, unchecked, attachment, to, possessions, is, said, to, result, in, direct, harm, to, one, s, personality, jainism, teaches, five, ethical, duties, which, it, calls, five, vows, these, are, called, anuvratas, small, vows, for, jain, laypersons, and, mahavratas, great, vows, for, jain, mendicants, for, both, its, moral, precepts, preface, that, the, jain, has, access, to, a, guru, teacher, counsellor, deva, jina, god, doctrine, and, that, the, individual, is, free, from, five, offences, doubts, about, the, faith, indecisiveness, about, the, truths, of, jainism, sincere, desire, for, jain, teachings, recognition, of, fellow, jains, and, admiration, for, their, spiritual, pursuits, such, a, person, undertakes, the, following, five, vows, of, jainism, jainism, prescribes, seven, supplementary, vows, including, three, gu, a, vratas, merit, vows, and, four, ik, vratas, the, sallekhana, or, santhara, vow, is, a, religious, death, ritual, observed, at, the, end, of, life, historically, by, jain, monks, and, nuns, but, rare, in, the, modern, age, in, this, vow, there, is, voluntary, and, gradual, reduction, of, food, and, liquid, intake, to, end, one, s, life, by, choice, and, with, dispassion, this, is, believed, to, reduce, negative, karma, that, affects, a, soul, s, future, rebirths, of, the, major, indian, religions, jainism, has, had, the, strongest, ascetic, tradition, ascetic, life, may, include, nakedness, symbolizing, non, possession, even, of, clothes, fasting, body, mortification, and, penance, to, burn, away, past, karma, and, stop, producing, new, karma, both, of, which, are, believed, essential, for, reaching, siddha, and, moksha, liberation, from, rebirths, and, salvation, jain, texts, like, tattvartha, s, tra, and, uttaradhyayana, s, tra, discuss, austerities, in, detail, six, outer, and, six, inner, practices, are, oft, repeated, in, later, jain, texts, outer, austerities, include, complete, fasting, eating, limited, amounts, eating, restricted, items, abstaining, from, tasty, foods, mortifying, the, flesh, and, guarding, the, flesh, avoiding, anything, that, is, a, source, of, temptation, inner, austerities, include, expiation, confession, respecting, and, assisting, mendicants, studying, meditation, and, ignoring, bodily, wants, in, order, to, abandon, the, body, lists, of, internal, and, external, austerities, vary, with, the, text, and, tradition, asceticism, is, viewed, as, a, means, to, control, desires, and, to, purify, the, jiva, soul, the, tirthankaras, such, as, the, mah, v, ra, vardhamana, set, an, example, by, performing, severe, austerities, for, twelve, years, monastic, organization, sangh, has, a, four, fold, order, consisting, of, sadhu, male, ascetics, muni, sadhvi, female, ascetics, aryika, r, vaka, laymen, and, r, vik, laywomen, the, latter, two, support, the, ascetics, and, their, monastic, organizations, called, gacch, or, samuday, in, autonomous, regional, jain, congregations, jain, monastic, rules, have, encouraged, the, use, of, mouth, cover, as, well, as, the, dandasan, a, long, stick, with, woolen, threads, to, gently, remove, ants, and, insects, that, may, come, in, their, path, the, practice, of, non, violence, towards, all, living, beings, has, led, to, jain, culture, being, vegetarian, devout, jains, practice, lacto, vegetarianism, meaning, that, they, eat, no, eggs, but, accept, dairy, products, if, there, is, no, violence, against, animals, during, their, production, veganism, is, encouraged, if, there, are, concerns, about, animal, welfare, jain, monks, nuns, and, some, followers, avoid, root, vegetables, such, as, potatoes, onions, and, garlic, because, tiny, organisms, are, injured, when, the, plant, is, pulled, up, and, because, a, bulb, or, tuber, s, ability, to, sprout, is, seen, as, characteristic, of, a, higher, living, being, jain, monks, and, advanced, lay, people, avoid, eating, after, sunset, observing, a, vow, of, ratri, bhojana, tyaga, vrata, monks, observe, a, stricter, vow, by, eating, only, once, a, day, jains, fast, particularly, during, festivals, this, practice, is, called, upavasa, tapasya, or, vrata, and, may, be, practiced, according, to, one, s, ability, digambaras, fast, for, dasa, laksana, parvan, eating, only, one, or, two, meals, per, day, drinking, only, boiled, water, for, ten, days, or, fasting, completely, on, the, first, and, last, days, of, the, festival, mimicking, the, practices, of, a, jain, mendicant, for, the, period, v, t, mbara, jains, do, similarly, in, the, eight, day, paryusana, with, samvatsari, pratikramana, the, practice, is, believed, to, remove, karma, from, one, s, soul, and, provides, merit, punya, a, one, day, fast, lasts, about, 36, hours, starting, at, sunset, before, the, day, of, the, fast, and, ending, 48, minutes, after, sunrise, the, day, after, among, laypeople, fasting, is, more, commonly, observed, by, women, as, it, shows, their, piety, and, religious, purity, gains, merit, earning, and, helps, ensure, future, well, being, for, their, family, some, religious, fasts, are, observed, in, a, social, and, supportive, female, group, long, fasts, are, celebrated, by, friends, and, families, with, special, ceremonies, jainism, considers, meditation, dhyana, a, necessary, practice, but, its, goals, are, very, different, from, those, in, buddhism, and, hinduism, in, jainism, meditation, is, concerned, more, with, stopping, karmic, attachments, and, activity, not, as, a, means, to, transformational, insights, or, self, realization, in, other, indian, religions, according, to, padmanabh, jaini, s, m, yika, is, a, practice, of, brief, periods, in, meditation, in, jainism, that, is, a, part, of, siksavrata, ritual, restraint, the, goal, of, s, m, yika, is, to, achieve, equanimity, and, it, is, the, second, siksavrata, the, samayika, ritual, is, practiced, at, least, three, times, a, day, by, mendicants, while, a, layperson, includes, it, with, other, ritual, practices, such, as, puja, in, a, jain, temple, and, doing, charity, work, according, to, johnson, as, well, as, jaini, samayika, connotes, more, than, meditation, and, for, a, jain, householder, is, the, voluntary, ritual, practice, of, assuming, temporary, ascetic, status, there, are, many, rituals, in, jainism, s, various, sects, according, to, dundas, the, ritualistic, lay, path, among, v, t, mbara, jains, is, heavily, imbued, with, ascetic, values, where, the, rituals, either, revere, or, celebrate, the, ascetic, life, of, tirthankaras, or, progressively, approach, the, psychological, and, physical, life, of, an, ascetic, the, ultimate, ritual, is, sallekhana, a, religious, death, through, ascetic, abandonment, of, food, and, drinks, the, digambara, jains, follow, the, same, theme, but, the, life, cycle, and, religious, rituals, are, closer, to, a, hindu, liturgy, the, overlap, is, mainly, in, the, life, cycle, rites, of, passage, rituals, and, likely, developed, because, jain, and, hindu, societies, overlapped, and, rituals, were, viewed, as, necessary, and, secular, jains, ritually, worship, numerous, deities, especially, the, jinas, in, jainism, a, jina, as, deva, is, not, an, avatar, incarnation, but, the, highest, state, of, omniscience, that, an, ascetic, tirthankara, achieved, out, of, the, 24, tirthankaras, jains, predominantly, worship, four, mah, v, ra, parshvanatha, neminatha, and, rishabhanatha, among, the, non, tirthankara, saints, devotional, worship, is, common, for, bahubali, among, the, digambaras, the, panch, kalyanaka, rituals, remember, the, five, life, events, of, the, tirthankaras, including, the, panch, kalyanaka, pratishtha, mahotsava, panch, kalyanaka, puja, and, snatrapuja, the, basic, ritual, is, darsana, seeing, of, deva, which, includes, jina, or, other, yaksas, gods, and, goddesses, such, as, brahmadeva, 52, viras, padmavati, ambika, and, 16, vidyadevis, including, sarasvati, and, lakshmi,
