the, socratic, method, also, known, as, method, of, elenchus, or, socratic, debate, is, a, form, of, argumentative, dialogue, between, individuals, based, on, asking, and, answering, questions, in, plato, s, dialogue, theaetetus, socrates, describes, his, method, as, a, form, of, midwifery, because, it, is, employed, to, help, his, interlocutors, develop, their, understanding, in, a, way, analogous, to, a, child, developing, in, the, womb, the, socratic, method, begins, with, commonly, held, beliefs, and, scrutinizes, them, by, way, of, questioning, to, determine, their, internal, consistency, and, their, coherence, with, other, beliefs, and, so, to, bring, everyone, closer, to, the, truth, in, modified, forms, it, is, employed, today, in, a, variety, of, pedagogical, contexts, in, the, second, half, of, the, 5th, century, bc, sophists, were, teachers, who, specialized, in, using, the, tools, of, philosophy, and, rhetoric, to, entertain, impress, or, persuade, an, audience, to, accept, the, speaker, s, point, of, view, socrates, promoted, an, alternative, method, of, teaching, which, came, to, be, called, the, socratic, method, socrates, began, to, engage, in, such, discussions, with, his, fellow, athenians, after, his, friend, from, youth, chaerephon, visited, the, oracle, of, delphi, which, asserted, that, no, man, in, greece, was, wiser, than, socrates, socrates, saw, this, as, a, paradox, and, began, using, the, socratic, method, to, answer, his, conundrum, diogenes, la, rtius, however, wrote, that, protagoras, invented, the, socratic, method, plato, famously, formalized, the, socratic, elenctic, style, in, prose, presenting, socrates, as, the, curious, questioner, of, some, prominent, athenian, interlocutor, in, some, of, his, early, dialogues, such, as, euthyphro, and, ion, and, the, method, is, most, commonly, found, within, the, so, called, socratic, dialogues, which, generally, portray, socrates, engaging, in, the, method, and, questioning, his, fellow, citizens, about, moral, and, epistemological, issues, but, in, his, later, dialogues, such, as, theaetetus, or, sophist, plato, had, a, different, method, to, philosophical, discussions, namely, dialectic, elenchus, ancient, greek, romanized, elenkhos, lit, argument, of, disproof, or, refutation, cross, examining, testing, scrutiny, esp, for, purposes, of, refutation, is, the, central, technique, of, the, socratic, method, the, latin, form, elenchus, plural, elenchi, is, used, in, english, as, the, technical, philosophical, term, the, most, common, adjectival, form, in, english, is, elenctic, elenchic, and, elenchtic, are, also, current, this, was, also, very, important, in, plato, s, early, dialogues, socrates, as, depicted, by, plato, generally, applied, his, method, of, examination, to, concepts, such, as, the, virtues, of, piety, wisdom, temperance, courage, and, justice, such, an, examination, challenged, the, implicit, moral, beliefs, of, the, interlocutors, bringing, out, inadequacies, and, inconsistencies, in, their, beliefs, and, usually, resulting, in, aporia, in, view, of, such, inadequacies, socrates, himself, professed, ignorance, socrates, said, that, his, awareness, of, his, ignorance, made, him, wiser, than, those, who, though, ignorant, still, claimed, knowledge, this, claim, was, based, on, a, reported, delphic, oracular, pronouncement, that, no, man, was, wiser, than, socrates, while, this, belief, seems, paradoxical, at, first, glance, in, fact, it, allowed, socrates, to, discover, his, own, errors, socrates, used, this, claim, of, wisdom, as, the, basis, of, moral, exhortation, he, claimed, that, the, chief, goodness, consists, in, the, caring, of, the, soul, concerned, with, moral, truth, and, moral, understanding, that, wealth, does, not, bring, goodness, but, goodness, brings, wealth, and, every, other, blessing, both, to, the, individual, and, to, the, state, and, that, life, without, examination, is, not, worth, living, socrates, rarely, used, the, method, to, actually, develop, consistent, theories, and, he, even, made, frequent, use, of, creative, myths, and, allegories, the, parmenides, dialogue, shows, parmenides, using, the, socratic, method, to, point, out, the, flaws, in, the, platonic, theory, of, forms, as, presented, by, socrates, it, is, not, the, only, dialogue, in, which, theories, normally, expounded, by, plato, s, socrates, are, broken, down, through, dialectic, instead, of, arriving, at, answers, the, method, breaks, down, the, theories, we, hold, to, go, beyond, the, axioms, and, postulates, we, take, for, granted, therefore, myth, and, the, socratic, method, are, not, meant, by, plato, to, be, incompatible, they, have, different, purposes, and, are, often, described, as, the, left, hand, and, right, hand, paths, to, good, and, wisdom, in, plato, s, early, dialogues, the, elenchus, is, the, technique, socrates, uses, to, investigate, for, example, the, nature, or, definition, of, ethical, concepts, such, as, justice, or, virtue, according, to, gregory, vlastos, it, has, the, following, steps, one, elenctic, examination, can, lead, to, a, new, more, refined, examination, of, the, concept, being, considered, in, this, case, it, invites, an, examination, of, the, claim, courage, is, wise, endurance, of, the, soul, most, socratic, inquiries, consist, of, a, series, of, elenchi, and, typically, end, in, puzzlement, known, as, aporia, michael, frede, points, out, vlastos, conclusion, in, step, no, 5, above, makes, nonsense, of, the, aporetic, nature, of, the, early, dialogues, having, shown, a, proposed, thesis, is, false, is, insufficient, to, conclude, some, other, competing, thesis, must, be, true, rather, the, interlocutors, have, reached, aporia, an, improved, state, of, still, not, knowing, what, to, say, about, the, subject, under, discussion, the, exact, nature, of, the, elenchus, is, subject, to, a, great, deal, of, debate, in, particular, concerning, whether, it, is, a, positive, method, leading, to, knowledge, or, a, negative, method, used, solely, to, refute, false, claims, to, knowledge, some, qualitative, research, shows, that, the, use, of, the, socratic, method, within, a, traditional, yeshiva, education, setting, helps, students, succeed, in, law, school, although, it, remains, an, open, question, as, to, whether, that, relationship, is, causal, or, merely, correlative, yet, w, k, c, guthrie, in, the, greek, philosophers, sees, it, as, an, error, to, regard, the, socratic, method, as, a, means, by, which, one, seeks, the, answer, to, a, problem, or, knowledge, guthrie, claims, that, the, socratic, method, actually, aims, to, demonstrate, one, s, ignorance, socrates, unlike, the, sophists, did, believe, that, knowledge, was, possible, but, believed, that, the, first, step, to, knowledge, was, recognition, of, one, s, ignorance, guthrie, writes, was, accustomed, to, say, that, he, did, not, himself, know, anything, and, that, the, only, way, in, which, he, was, wiser, than, other, men, was, that, he, was, conscious, of, his, own, ignorance, while, they, were, not, the, essence, of, the, socratic, method, is, to, convince, the, interlocutor, that, whereas, he, thought, he, knew, something, in, fact, he, does, not, a, socratic, seminar, also, known, as, a, socratic, circle, is, a, pedagogical, approach, based, on, the, socratic, method, and, uses, a, dialogic, approach, to, understand, information, in, a, text, its, systematic, procedure, is, used, to, examine, a, text, through, questions, and, answers, founded, on, the, beliefs, that, all, new, knowledge, is, connected, to, prior, knowledge, that, all, thinking, comes, from, asking, questions, and, that, asking, one, question, should, lead, to, asking, further, questions, a, socratic, seminar, is, not, a, debate, the, goal, of, this, activity, is, to, have, participants, work, together, to, construct, meaning, and, arrive, at, an, answer, not, for, one, student, or, one, group, to, win, the, argument, this, approach, is, based, on, the, belief, that, participants, seek, and, gain, deeper, understanding, of, concepts, in, the, text, through, thoughtful, dialogue, rather, than, memorizing, information, that, has, been, provided, for, them, while, socratic, seminars, can, differ, in, structure, and, even, in, name, they, typically, involve, a, passage, of, text, that, students, must, read, beforehand, and, facilitate, dialogue, sometimes, a, facilitator, will, structure, two, concentric, circles, of, students, an, outer, circle, and, an, inner, circle, the, inner, circle, focuses, on, exploring, and, analysing, the, text, through, the, act, of, questioning, and, answering, during, this, phase, the, outer, circle, remains, silent, students, in, the, outer, circle, are, much, like, scientific, observers, watching, and, listening, to, the, conversation, of, the, inner, circle, when, the, text, has, been, fully, discussed, and, the, inner, circle, is, finished, talking, the, outer, circle, provides, feedback, on, the, dialogue, that, took, place, this, process, alternates, with, the, inner, circle, students, going, to, the, outer, circle, for, the, next, meeting, and, vice, versa, the, length, of, this, process, varies, depending, on, the, text, used, for, the, discussion, the, teacher, may, decide, to, alternate, groups, within, one, meeting, or, they, may, alternate, at, each, separate, meeting, the, most, significant, difference, between, this, activity, and, most, typical, classroom, activities, involves, the, role, of, the, teacher, in, socratic, seminar, the, students, lead, the, discussion, and, questioning, the, teacher, s, role, is, to, ensure, the, discussion, advances, regardless, of, the, particular, direction, the, discussion, takes, teachers, use, socratic, seminar, in, different, ways, the, structure, it, takes, may, look, different, in, each, classroom, while, this, is, not, an, exhaustive, list, teachers, may, use, one, of, the, following, structures, to, administer, socratic, seminar, no, matter, what, structure, the, teacher, employs, the, basic, premise, of, the, seminar, circles, is, to, turn, partial, control, and, direction, of, the, classroom, over, to, the, students, the, seminars, encourage, students, to, work, together, creating, meaning, from, the, text, and, to, stay, away, from, trying, to, find, a, correct, interpretation, the, emphasis, is, on, critical, and, creative, thinking, a, socratic, seminar, text, is, a, tangible, document, that, creates, a, thought, provoking, discussion, the, text, ought, to, be, appropriate, for, the, participants, current, level, of, intellectual, and, social, development, it, provides, the, anchor, for, dialogue, whereby, the, facilitator, can, bring, the, participants, back, to, the, text, if, they, begin, to, digress, furthermore, the, seminar, text, enables, the, participants, to, create, a, level, playing, field, ensuring, that, the, dialogical, tone, within, the, classroom, remains, consistent, and, pure, to, the, subject, or, topic, at, hand, some, practitioners, argue, that, texts, do, not, have, to, be, confined, to, printed, texts, but, can, include, artifacts, such, as, objects, physical, spaces, and, the, like, socratic, seminar, texts, are, able, to, challenge, participants, thinking, skills, by, having, these, characteristics, socratic, texts, can, be, divided, into, two, main, categories, socratic, seminars, are, based, upon, the, interaction, of, peers, the, focus, is, to, explore, multiple, perspectives, on, a, given, issue, or, topic, socratic, questioning, is, used, to, help, students, apply, the, activity, to, their, learning, the, pedagogy, of, socratic, questions, is, open, ended, focusing, on, broad, general, ideas, rather, than, specific, factual, information, the, questioning, technique, emphasizes, a, level, of, questioning, and, thinking, where, there, is, no, single, right, answer, socratic, seminars, generally, start, with, an, open, ended, question, proposed, either, by, the, leader, or, by, another, participant, there, is, no, designated, first, speaker, as, individuals, participate, in, socratic, dialogue, they, gain, experience, that, enables, them, to, be, effective, in, this, role, of, initial, questioner, the, leader, keeps, the, topic, focused, by, asking, a, variety, of, questions, about, the, text, itself, as, well, as, questions, to, help, clarify, positions, when, arguments, become, confused, the, leader, also, seeks, to, coax, reluctant, participants, into, the, discussion, and, to, limit, contributions, from, those, who, tend, to, dominate, she, or, he, prompts, participants, to, elaborate, on, their, responses, and, to, build, on, what, others, have, said, the, leader, guides, participants, to, deepen, clarify, and, paraphrase, and, to, synthesize, a, variety, of, different, views, the, participants, share, the, responsibility, with, the, leader, to, maintain, the, quality, of, the, socratic, circle, they, listen, actively, to, respond, effectively, to, what, others, have, contributed, this, teaches, the, participants, to, think, and, speak, persuasively, using, the, discussion, to, support, their, position, participants, must, demonstrate, respect, for, different, ideas, thoughts, and, values, and, must, not, interrupt, each, other, questions, can, be, created, individually, or, in, small, groups, all, participants, are, given, the, opportunity, to, take, part, in, the, discussion, socratic, circles, specify, three, types, of, questions, to, prepare, scholars, such, as, peter, boghossian, suggest, that, although, the, method, improves, creative, and, critical, thinking, there, is, a, flip, side, to, the, method, he, states, that, the, teachers, who, use, this, method, wait, for, the, students, to, make, mistakes, thus, creating, negative, feelings, in, the, class, exposing, the, student, to, possible, ridicule, and, humiliation, some, have, countered, this, thought, by, stating, that, the, humiliation, and, ridicule, is, not, caused, by, the, method, rather, it, is, due, to, the, lack, of, knowledge, of, the, student, boghossian, mentions, that, even, though, the, questions, may, be, perplexing, they, are, not, originally, meant, for, it, in, fact, such, questions, provoke, the, students, and, can, be, countered, by, employing, counterexamples, the, socratic, method, in, the, form, of, socratic, questioning, has, been, adapted, for, psychotherapy, most, prominently, in, classical, adlerian, psychotherapy, logotherapy, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, cognitive, therapy, and, reality, therapy, it, can, be, used, to, clarify, meaning, feeling, and, consequences, as, well, as, to, gradually, unfold, insight, or, explore, alternative, actions, the, socratic, method, has, also, recently, inspired, a, new, form, of, applied, philosophy, socratic, dialogue, also, called, philosophical, counseling, in, europe, gerd, b, achenbach, is, probably, the, best, known, practitioner, and, michel, weber, has, also, proposed, another, variant, of, the, practice
