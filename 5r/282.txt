traditional, in, hinduism, brahman, sanskrit, iast, brahman, connotes, the, highest, universal, principle, the, ultimate, reality, of, the, universe, in, major, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, it, is, the, non, physical, efficient, formal, and, final, cause, of, all, that, exists, it, is, the, pervasive, infinite, eternal, truth, consciousness, and, bliss, which, does, not, change, yet, is, the, cause, of, all, changes, brahman, as, a, metaphysical, concept, refers, to, the, single, binding, unity, behind, diversity, in, all, that, exists, brahman, is, a, vedic, sanskrit, word, and, it, is, conceptualized, in, hinduism, states, paul, deussen, as, the, creative, principle, which, lies, realized, in, the, whole, world, brahman, is, a, key, concept, found, in, the, vedas, and, it, is, extensively, discussed, in, the, early, upanishads, the, vedas, conceptualize, brahman, as, the, cosmic, principle, in, the, upanishads, it, has, been, variously, described, as, sat, cit, nanda, truth, consciousness, bliss, and, as, the, unchanging, permanent, highest, reality, brahman, is, discussed, in, hindu, texts, with, the, concept, of, atman, sanskrit, self, personal, impersonal, or, para, brahman, or, in, various, combinations, of, these, qualities, depending, on, the, philosophical, school, in, dualistic, schools, of, hinduism, such, as, the, theistic, dvaita, vedanta, brahman, is, different, from, atman, self, in, each, being, in, non, dual, schools, such, as, the, advaita, vedanta, the, substance, of, brahman, is, identical, to, the, substance, of, atman, is, everywhere, and, inside, each, living, being, and, there, is, connected, spiritual, oneness, in, all, existence, sanskrit, brahman, an, n, stem, nominative, br, hma, from, a, root, b, h, to, swell, expand, grow, enlarge, is, a, neuter, noun, to, be, distinguished, from, the, masculine, brahm, n, denoting, a, person, associated, with, brahman, and, from, brahm, the, creator, god, in, the, hindu, trinity, the, trimurti, brahman, is, thus, a, gender, neutral, concept, that, implies, greater, impersonality, than, masculine, or, feminine, conceptions, of, the, deity, brahman, is, referred, to, as, the, supreme, self, puligandla, states, it, as, the, unchanging, reality, amidst, and, beyond, the, world, while, sinar, states, brahman, is, a, concept, that, cannot, be, exactly, defined, in, vedic, sanskrit, in, later, sanskrit, usage, these, are, distinct, from, brahman, is, a, concept, present, in, vedic, samhitas, the, oldest, layer, of, the, vedas, dated, to, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bce, for, example, the, cs, are, limited, parimita, the, samans, are, limited, and, the, yajuses, are, limited, but, of, the, word, brahman, there, is, no, end, the, concept, brahman, is, referred, to, in, hundreds, of, hymns, in, the, vedic, literature, the, word, brahma, is, found, in, rig, veda, hymns, such, as, 2, 2, 10, 6, 21, 8, 10, 72, 2, and, in, atharva, veda, hymns, such, as, 6, 122, 5, 10, 1, 12, and, 14, 1, 131, the, concept, is, found, in, various, layers, of, the, vedic, literature, for, example, aitareya, brahmana, 1, 18, 3, kausitaki, brahmana, 6, 12, satapatha, brahmana, 13, 5, 2, 5, taittiriya, brahmana, 2, 8, 8, 10, jaiminiya, brahmana, 1, 129, taittiriya, aranyaka, 4, 4, 1, through, 5, 4, 1, vajasaneyi, samhita, 22, 4, through, 23, 25, maitrayani, samhita, 3, 12, 1, 16, 2, through, 4, 9, 2, 122, 15, the, concept, is, extensively, discussed, in, the, upanishads, embedded, in, the, vedas, see, next, section, and, also, mentioned, in, the, ved, ga, the, limbs, of, vedas, such, as, the, srauta, sutra, 1, 12, 12, and, paraskara, gryhasutra, 3, 2, 10, through, 3, 4, 5, jan, gonda, states, that, the, diverse, reference, of, brahman, in, the, vedic, literature, starting, with, rigveda, samhitas, convey, different, senses, or, different, shades, of, meaning, there, is, no, one, single, word, in, modern, western, languages, that, can, render, the, various, shades, of, meaning, of, the, word, brahman, in, the, vedic, literature, according, to, jan, gonda, in, verses, considered, as, the, most, ancient, the, vedic, idea, of, brahman, is, the, power, immanent, in, the, sound, words, verses, and, formulas, of, vedas, however, states, gonda, the, verses, suggest, that, this, ancient, meaning, was, never, the, only, meaning, and, the, concept, evolved, and, expanded, in, ancient, india, barbara, holdrege, states, that, the, concept, brahman, is, discussed, in, the, vedas, along, four, major, themes, as, the, word, or, verses, sabdabrahman, as, knowledge, embodied, in, creator, principle, as, creation, itself, and, a, corpus, of, traditions, hananya, goodman, states, that, the, vedas, conceptualize, brahman, as, the, cosmic, principles, underlying, all, that, exists, gavin, flood, states, that, the, vedic, era, witnessed, a, process, of, abstraction, where, the, concept, of, brahman, evolved, and, expanded, from, the, power, of, sound, words, and, rituals, to, the, essence, of, the, universe, the, deeper, foundation, of, all, phenomena, the, essence, of, the, self, atman, self, and, the, deeper, truth, of, a, person, beyond, apparent, difference, the, central, concern, of, all, upanishads, is, to, discover, the, relations, between, ritual, cosmic, realities, including, gods, and, the, human, body, person, the, texts, do, not, present, a, single, unified, theory, rather, they, present, a, variety, of, themes, with, multiple, possible, interpretations, which, flowered, in, post, vedic, era, as, premises, for, the, diverse, schools, of, hinduism, paul, deussen, states, that, the, concept, of, brahman, in, the, upanishads, expands, to, metaphysical, ontological, and, soteriological, themes, such, as, it, being, the, primordial, reality, that, creates, maintains, and, withdraws, within, it, the, universe, the, principle, of, the, world, the, absolute, the, general, universal, the, cosmic, principle, the, ultimate, that, is, the, cause, of, everything, including, all, gods, the, divine, being, lord, distinct, god, or, god, within, oneself, the, knowledge, the, self, sense, of, self, of, each, human, being, that, is, fearless, luminuous, exalted, and, blissful, the, essence, of, liberation, of, spiritual, freedom, the, universe, within, each, living, being, and, the, universe, outside, the, essence, and, everything, innate, in, all, that, exists, inside, outside, and, everywhere, gavin, flood, summarizes, the, concept, of, brahman, in, the, upanishads, to, be, the, essence, the, smallest, particle, of, the, cosmos, and, the, infinite, universe, the, essence, of, all, things, which, cannot, be, seen, though, it, can, be, experienced, the, self, within, each, person, each, being, the, truth, the, reality, the, absolute, the, bliss, ananda, according, to, radhakrishnan, the, sages, of, the, upanishads, teach, brahman, as, the, ultimate, essence, of, material, phenomena, that, cannot, be, seen, or, heard, but, whose, nature, can, be, known, through, the, development, of, self, knowledge, atma, jnana, the, upanishads, contain, several, mah, v, kyas, or, great, sayings, on, the, concept, of, brahman, the, upanishad, discuss, the, metaphysical, concept, of, brahman, in, many, ways, such, as, the, ilya, doctrine, in, chapter, 3, of, the, chandogya, upanishad, among, of, the, oldest, upanishadic, texts, the, ilya, doctrine, on, brahman, is, not, unique, to, chandogya, upanishad, but, found, in, other, ancient, texts, such, as, the, satapatha, brahmana, in, section, 10, 6, 3, it, asserts, that, atman, the, inner, essence, self, inside, man, exists, the, brahman, is, identical, with, atman, that, the, brahman, is, inside, man, thematic, quotations, that, are, frequently, cited, by, later, schools, of, hinduism, and, modern, studies, on, indian, philosophies, this, whole, universe, is, brahman, in, tranquility, let, one, worship, it, as, tajjalan, that, from, which, he, came, forth, as, that, into, which, he, will, be, dissolved, as, that, in, which, he, breathes, man, is, a, creature, of, his, kratumaya, will, purpose, let, him, therefore, have, for, himself, this, will, this, purpose, the, intelligent, whose, body, is, imbued, with, life, principle, whose, form, is, light, whose, thoughts, are, driven, by, truth, whose, self, is, like, space, invisible, but, ever, present, from, whom, all, works, all, desires, all, sensory, feelings, encompassing, this, whole, world, the, silent, the, unconcerned, this, is, me, my, self, my, soul, within, my, heart, this, is, my, soul, in, the, innermost, heart, greater, than, the, earth, greater, than, the, aerial, space, greater, than, these, worlds, this, soul, this, self, of, mine, is, that, brahman, paul, deussen, notes, that, teachings, similar, to, above, on, brahman, re, appeared, centuries, later, in, the, words, of, the, 3rd, century, ce, neoplatonic, roman, philosopher, plotinus, in, enneades, 5, 1, 2, the, concept, brahman, has, a, lot, of, undertones, of, meaning, and, is, difficult, to, understand, it, has, relevance, in, metaphysics, ontology, axiology, ethics, aesthetics, teleology, and, soteriology, brahman, is, the, key, metaphysical, concept, in, various, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, it, is, the, theme, in, its, diverse, discussions, to, the, two, central, questions, of, metaphysics, what, is, ultimately, real, and, are, there, principles, applying, to, everything, that, is, real, brahman, is, the, ultimate, eternally, constant, reality, while, the, observed, universe, is, a, different, kind, of, reality, but, one, which, is, temporary, changing, maya, in, various, orthodox, hindu, schools, maya, pre, exists, and, co, exists, with, brahman, the, ultimate, reality, the, highest, universal, the, cosmic, principles, in, addition, to, the, concept, of, brahman, hindu, metaphysics, includes, the, concept, of, atman, or, self, which, is, also, considered, ultimately, real, the, various, schools, of, hinduism, particularly, the, dual, and, non, dual, schools, differ, on, the, nature, of, atman, whether, it, is, distinct, from, brahman, or, same, as, brahman, those, that, consider, brahman, and, atman, as, distinct, are, theistic, and, dvaita, vedanta, and, later, nyaya, schools, illustrate, this, premise, those, that, consider, brahman, and, atman, as, same, are, monist, or, pantheistic, and, advaita, vedanta, later, samkhya, and, yoga, schools, illustrate, this, metaphysical, premise, in, schools, that, equate, brahman, with, atman, brahman, is, the, sole, ultimate, reality, the, predominant, teaching, in, the, upanishads, is, the, spiritual, identity, of, self, within, each, human, being, with, the, self, of, every, other, human, being, and, living, being, as, well, as, with, the, supreme, ultimate, reality, brahman, in, the, metaphysics, of, the, major, schools, of, hinduism, maya, is, perceived, reality, one, that, does, not, reveal, the, hidden, principles, the, true, reality, the, brahman, maya, is, unconscious, brahman, atman, is, conscious, maya, is, the, literal, and, the, effect, brahman, is, the, figurative, up, d, na, the, principle, and, the, cause, maya, is, born, changes, evolves, dies, with, time, from, circumstances, due, to, invisible, principles, of, nature, atman, brahman, is, eternal, unchanging, invisible, principle, unaffected, absolute, and, resplendent, consciousness, maya, concept, states, archibald, gough, is, the, indifferent, aggregate, of, all, the, possibilities, of, emanatory, or, derived, existences, pre, existing, with, brahman, just, like, the, possibility, of, a, future, tree, pre, exists, in, the, seed, of, the, tree, brahman, the, ultimate, reality, is, both, with, and, without, attributes, in, this, context, para, brahman, is, formless, and, omniscient, ishvara, the, god, or, paramatman, and, om, where, as, saguna, brahman, is, manifestation, or, avatara, of, god, in, personified, form, while, hinduism, sub, schools, such, as, advaita, vedanta, emphasize, the, complete, equivalence, of, brahman, and, atman, they, also, expound, on, brahman, as, saguna, brahman, the, brahman, with, attributes, and, nirguna, brahman, the, brahman, without, attributes, the, nirguna, brahman, is, the, brahman, as, it, really, is, however, the, saguna, brahman, is, posited, as, a, means, to, realizing, nirguna, brahman, but, the, hinduism, schools, declare, saguna, brahman, to, be, a, part, of, the, ultimate, nirguna, brahman, the, concept, of, the, saguna, brahman, such, as, in, the, form, of, avatars, is, considered, in, these, schools, of, hinduism, to, be, a, useful, symbolism, path, and, tool, for, those, who, are, still, on, their, spiritual, journey, but, the, concept, is, finally, cast, aside, by, the, fully, enlightened, brahman, along, with, self, atman, are, part, of, the, ontological, premises, of, indian, philosophy, different, schools, of, indian, philosophy, have, held, widely, dissimilar, ontologies, buddhism, and, carvaka, school, of, hinduism, deny, that, there, exists, anything, called, a, self, individual, atman, or, brahman, in, the, cosmic, sense, while, the, orthodox, schools, of, hinduism, jainism, and, ajivikas, hold, that, there, exists, a, self, brahman, as, well, the, atman, in, every, human, being, and, living, being, is, considered, equivalent, and, the, sole, reality, the, eternal, self, born, unlimited, innately, free, blissful, absolute, in, schools, of, hinduism, such, as, the, advaita, vedanta, and, yoga, knowing, one, s, own, self, is, knowing, the, god, inside, oneself, and, this, is, held, as, the, path, to, knowing, the, ontological, nature, of, brahman, universal, self, as, it, is, identical, to, the, atman, individual, self, the, nature, of, atman, brahman, is, held, in, these, schools, states, barbara, holdrege, to, be, as, a, pure, being, sat, consciousness, cit, and, full, of, bliss, ananda, and, it, is, formless, distinctionless, nonchanging, and, unbounded, in, theistic, schools, in, contrast, such, as, dvaita, vedanta, the, nature, of, brahman, is, held, as, eternal, unlimited, innately, free, blissful, absolute, while, each, individual, s, self, is, held, as, distinct, and, limited, which, can, at, best, come, close, in, eternal, blissful, love, of, the, brahman, therein, viewed, as, the, godhead, other, schools, of, hinduism, have, their, own, ontological, premises, relating, to, brahman, reality, and, nature, of, existence, vaisheshika, school, of, hinduism, for, example, holds, a, substantial, realist, ontology, the, carvaka, school, denied, brahman, and, atman, and, held, a, materialist, ontology, brahman, and, atman, are, key, concepts, to, hindu, theories, of, axiology, ethics, and, aesthetics, ananda, bliss, state, michael, myers, and, other, scholars, has, axiological, importance, to, the, concept, of, brahman, as, the, universal, inner, harmony, some, scholars, equate, brahman, with, the, highest, value, in, an, axiological, sense, the, axiological, concepts, of, brahman, and, atman, is, central, to, hindu, theory, of, values, a, statement, such, as, i, am, brahman, states, shaw, means, i, am, related, to, everything, and, this, is, the, underlying, premise, for, compassion, for, others, in, hinduism, for, each, individual, s, welfare, peace, or, happiness, depends, on, others, including, other, beings, and, nature, at, large, and, vice, versa, tietge, states, that, even, in, non, dual, schools, of, hinduism, where, brahman, and, atman, are, treated, ontologically, equivalent, the, theory, of, values, emphasizes, individual, agent, and, ethics, in, these, schools, of, hinduism, states, tietge, the, theory, of, action, are, derived, from, and, centered, in, compassion, for, the, other, and, not, egotistical, concern, for, the, self, the, axiological, theory, of, values, emerges, implicitly, from, the, concepts, of, brahman, and, atman, states, bauer, the, aesthetics, of, human, experience, and, ethics, are, one, consequence, of, self, knowledge, in, hinduism, one, resulting, from, the, perfect, timeless, unification, of, one, s, self, with, the, brahman, the, self, of, everyone, everything, and, all, eternity, wherein, the, pinnacle, of, human, experience, is, not, dependent, on, an, afterlife, but, pure, consciousness, in, the, present, life, itself, it, does, not, assume, that, an, individual, is, weak, nor, does, it, presume, that, he, is, inherently, evil, but, the, opposite, human, self, and, its, nature, is, held, as, fundamentally, unqualified, faultless, beautiful, blissful, ethical, compassionate, and, good, ignorance, is, to, assume, it, evil, liberation, is, to, know, its, eternal, expansive, pristine, happy, and, good, nature, the, axiological, premises, in, the, hindu, thought, and, indian, philosophies, in, general, states, nikam, is, to, elevate, the, individual, exalting, the, innate, potential, of, man, where, the, reality, of, his, being, is, the, objective, reality, of, the, universe, the, upanishads, of, hinduism, summarizes, nikam, hold, that, the, individual, has, the, same, essence, and, reality, as, the, objective, universe, and, this, essence, is, the, finest, essence, the, individual, self, is, the, universal, self, and, atman, is, the, same, reality, and, the, same, aesthetics, as, the, brahman, brahman, and, atman, are, very, important, teleological, concepts, teleology, deals, with, the, apparent, purpose, principle, or, goal, of, something, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, these, questions, are, addressed, it, says, people, who, make, inquiries, about, brahman, say, what, is, the, cause, of, brahman, why, were, we, born, by, what, do, we, live, on, what, are, we, established, governed, by, whom, o, you, who, know, brahman, do, we, live, in, pleasure, and, in, pain, each, in, our, respective, situation, according, to, the, upanishads, the, main, purpose, meaning, of, anything, or, everything, can, be, explained, or, achieved, understood, only, through, the, realization, of, the, brahman, the, apparent, purpose, of, everything, can, be, grasped, by, obtaining, the, brahman, as, the, brahman, is, referred, to, that, when, known, all, things, become, known, what, is, that, my, lord, by, which, being, known, all, of, this, becomes, known, angiras, told, him, two, types, of, knowledge, a, man, should, learn, those, who, know, brahman, tell, us, the, higher, and, the, lower, the, lower, of, the, two, consists, of, the, rgveda, yajurveda, samaveda, whereas, the, higher, is, that, by, which, one, grasps, the, imperishable, brahman, elsewhere, in, the, upanishads, the, relationship, between, brahman, all, knowledge, is, established, such, that, any, questions, of, apparent, purpose, teleology, are, resolved, when, the, brahman, is, ultimately, known, this, is, found, in, the, aitareya, upanishad, 3, 3, and, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, 4, 4, 17, knowledge, is, the, eye, of, all, that, and, on, knowledge, it, is, founded, knowledge, is, the, eye, of, the, world, and, knowledge, the, foundation, brahman, is, knowing, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, brahman, should, be, realized, is, because, it, removes, suffering, from, a, person, s, life, following, on, advaita, vedanta, tradition, this, is, because, the, person, has, the, ability, and, knowledge, to, discriminate, between, the, unchanging, purusha, atman, brahman, and, the, ever, changing, prakriti, maya, and, so, the, person, is, not, attached, to, the, transient, fleeting, impermanent, hence, the, person, is, only, content, with, their, true, self, and, not, the, body, or, anything, else, further, elaborations, of, brahman, as, the, central, teleological, issue, are, found, in, shankara, s, commentaries, of, the, brahma, sutras, his, vivekachudamani, in, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, 3, 9, 26, it, mentions, that, the, atman, neither, trembles, in, fear, nor, suffers, injury, and, the, isha, upanishad, 6, 7, too, talks, about, suffering, as, non, existent, when, one, becomes, the, brahman, as, they, see, the, self, in, all, beings, and, all, beings, in, the, self, the, famous, advaita, vedanta, commentator, shankara, noted, that, sabda, pramana, scriptural, epistemology, anubhava, personal, experience, is, the, ultimate, only, source, of, knowing, learning, the, brahman, and, that, its, purpose, or, existence, cannot, be, verified, independently, because, it, is, not, an, object, of, perception, inference, unless, one, is, spiritually, advanced, thereby, it, s, truth, becomes, self, evident, intuitive, is, beyond, conceptualizations, but, he, does, note, the, upanishads, themselves, are, ultimately, derived, from, use, of, the, various, pramanas, to, derive, at, ultimate, truths, as, seen, in, yalnavalkya, s, philosophical, inquires, all, vedanta, schools, agree, on, this, these, teleological, discussions, inspired, some, refutations, from, competing, philosophies, about, the, origin, purpose, of, brahman, avidya, ignorance, and, the, relationship, between, the, two, leading, to, variant, schools, like, kashmiri, shaivism, others, the, orthodox, schools, of, hinduism, particularly, vedanta, samkhya, and, yoga, schools, focus, on, the, concept, of, brahman, and, atman, in, their, discussion, of, moksha, the, advaita, vedanta, holds, there, is, no, being, non, being, distinction, between, atman, and, brahman, the, knowledge, of, atman, self, knowledge, is, synonymous, to, the, knowledge, of, brahman, inside, the, person, and, outside, the, person, furthermore, the, knowledge, of, brahman, leads, to, a, sense, of, oneness, with, all, existence, self, realization, indescribable, joy, and, moksha, freedom, bliss, because, brahman, atman, is, the, origin, and, end, of, all, things, the, universal, principle, behind, and, at, source, of, everything, that, exists, consciousness, that, pervades, everything, and, everyone, the, theistic, sub, school, such, as, dvaita, vedanta, of, hinduism, starts, with, the, same, premises, but, adds, the, premise, that, individual, self, and, brahman, are, distinct, and, thereby, reaches, entirely, different, conclusions, where, brahman, is, conceptualized, in, a, manner, similar, to, god, in, other, major, world, religions, the, theistic, schools, assert, that, moksha, is, the, loving, eternal, union, or, nearness, of, one, s, self, with, the, distinct, and, separate, brahman, vishnu, shiva, or, equivalent, henotheism, brahman, in, these, sub, schools, of, hinduism, is, considered, the, highest, perfection, of, existence, which, every, self, journeys, towards, in, its, own, way, for, moksha, the, concept, of, brahman, its, nature, and, its, relationship, with, atman, and, the, observed, universe, is, a, major, point, of, difference, between, the, various, sub, schools, of, the, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, shaivism, tantra, nath, new, movements, kashmir, shaivism, gaudapada, adi, shankara, advaita, yoga, nath, kashmir, shaivism, neo, vedanta, inchegeri, sampradaya, contemporary, shaivism, tantra, nath, neo, advaita, hinduism, buddhism, modern, advaita, vedanta, neo, vedanta, advaita, vedanta, espouses, nondualism, brahman, is, the, sole, unchanging, reality, there, is, no, duality, no, limited, individual, self, nor, a, separate, unlimited, cosmic, self, rather, all, self, all, of, existence, across, all, space, and, time, is, one, and, the, same, the, universe, and, the, self, inside, each, being, is, brahman, and, the, universe, and, the, self, outside, each, being, is, brahman, brahman, is, the, origin, and, end, of, all, things, material, and, spiritual, brahman, is, the, root, source, of, everything, that, exists, he, states, that, brahman, can, neither, be, taught, nor, perceived, as, an, object, of, intellectual, knowledge, but, it, can, be, learned, and, realized, by, all, human, beings, the, goal, of, advaita, vedanta, is, to, realize, that, one, s, self, atman, gets, obscured, by, ignorance, and, false, identification, avidya, when, avidya, is, removed, the, atman, self, inside, a, person, is, realized, as, identical, with, brahman, the, brahman, is, not, an, outside, separate, dual, entity, the, brahman, is, within, each, person, states, advaita, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, brahman, is, all, that, is, eternal, unchanging, and, that, which, truly, exists, this, view, is, stated, in, this, school, in, many, different, forms, such, as, ekam, sat, truth, is, one, and, all, is, brahman, the, universe, does, not, simply, come, from, brahman, it, is, brahman, according, to, adi, shankara, a, proponent, of, advaita, vedanta, the, knowledge, of, brahman, that, shruti, provides, cannot, be, obtained, by, any, other, means, besides, self, inquiry, in, advaita, vedanta, nirguna, brahman, is, held, to, be, the, ultimate, and, sole, reality, consciousness, is, not, a, property, of, brahman, but, rather, its, very, nature, in, this, respect, advaita,

by, his, own, nature, is, free, from, all, imperfections, and, in, possession, of, host, of, innumerable, auspicious, qualities, of, unsurpassable, excellence, using, this, definition, ramanuja, argues, that, brahman, must, be, god, because, brahman, s, qualities, are, unsurpassably, superior, to, all, and, thus, only, the, lord, of, all, can, thus, be, denoted, and, brahman, primarily, denotes, him, alone, ramanuja, asserts, that, the, relationship, between, god, and, the, individual, selves, must, be, one, of, devotion, and, moksha, or, liberation, is, said, by, him, to, be,

which, is, devotion, the, acintya, bheda, abheda, philosophy, is, similar, to, dvaitadvaita, differential, monism, in, this, philosophy, brahman, is, not, just, impersonal, but, also, personal, that, brahman, is, supreme, personality, of, godhead, though, on, first, stage, of, realization, by, process, called, jnana, of, absolute, truth, he, is, realized, as, impersonal, brahman, then, as, personal, brahman, having, eternal, vaikuntha, abode, also, known, as, brahmalokah, sanatana, then, as, paramatma, by, process, of, yoga, meditation, on, superself, vishnu, god, in, heart, vishnu, narayana, also, in, everyone, s, heart, who, has, many, abodes, known, as, vishnulokas, vaikunthalokas, and, finally, absolute, truth, is, realized, by, bhakti, as, bhagavan, supreme, personality, of,

and, saguna, nirguna, brahman, was, the, concept, of, the, ultimate, reality, as, formless, without, attributes, or, quality, saguna, brahman, in, contrast, was, envisioned, and, developed, as, with, form, attributes, and, quality, the, two, had, parallels, in, the, ancient, pantheistic, unmanifest, and, theistic, manifest, traditions, respectively, and, traceable, to, arjuna, krishna, dialogue, in, the, bhagavad, gita, it, is, the, same, brahman, but, viewed, from, two, perspectives, one, from, nirguni, knowledge, focus, and, other, from, saguni, love, focus, united, as, krishna, an, 8th, incarnation, of, lord, vishnu, in, the, gita, nirguna, bhakta, s, poetry, were, jnana, shrayi, or, had, roots, in, knowledge, saguna, bhakta, s, poetry, were, prema, shrayi, or, with, roots, in, love, in, bhakti, the, emphasis, is, reciprocal, love, and, devotion, where, the, devotee, loves, god, and, god, loves, the, devotee, jeaneane, fowler, states, that, the, concepts, of, nirguna, and, saguna, brahman, at, the, root, of, bhakti, movement, theosophy, underwent, more, profound, development, with, the, ideas, of, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, particularly, those, of, adi, shankara, s, advaita, vedanta, ramanuja, s, vishishtadvaita, vedanta, and, madhvacharya, s, dvaita, vedanta, two, 12th, century, influential, treatises, on, bhakti, were, sandilya, bhakti, sutra, a, treatise, resonating, with, nirguna, bhakti, and, narada, bhakti, sutra, a, treatise, that, leans, towards, saguna, bhakti, nirguna, and, saguna, brahman, concepts, of, the, bhakti, movement, has, been, a, baffling, one, to, scholars, particularly, the, nirguni, tradition, because, it, offers, states, david, lorenzen, heart, felt, devotion, to, a, god, without, attributes, without, even, any, definable, personality, yet, given, the, mountains, of, nirguni, bhakti, literature, adds, lorenzen, bhakti, for, nirguna, brahman, has, been, a, part, of, the, reality, of, the, hindu, tradition, along, with, the, bhakti, for, saguna, brahman, these, were, two, alternate, ways, of, imagining, god, during, the, bhakti, movement, buddhism, rejects, the, upanishadic, doctrine, of, brahman, and, atman, permanent, self, essence, according, to, damien, keown, the, buddha, said, he, could, find, no, evidence, for, the, existence, of, either, the, personal, self, atman, or, its, cosmic, counterpart, brahman, the, metaphysics, of, buddhism, rejects, brahman, ultimate, being, brahman, like, essence, self, and, anything, metaphysically, equivalent, through, its, anatta, doctrine, but, their, belief, of, trikaya, is, very, similar, to, the, sat, cit, ananda, characteristics, of, brahman, according, to, merv, fowler, some, forms, of, buddhism, have, incorporated, concepts, that, resemble, that, of, brahman, as, an, example, fowler, cites, the, early, sarvastivada, school, of, buddhism, which, had, come, to, accept, a, very, pantheistic, religious, philosophy, and, are, important, because, of, the, impetus, they, gave, to, the, development, of, mahayana, buddhism, according, to, william, theodore, de, bary, in, the, doctrines, of, the, yogacara, school, of, mahayana, buddhism, the, body, of, essence, the, ultimate, buddha, who, pervaded, and, underlay, the, whole, universe, was, in, fact, the, world, self, the, brahman, of, the, upanishads, in, a, new, form, according, to, fowler, some, scholars, have, identified, the, buddhist, nirvana, conceived, of, as, the, ultimate, reality, with, the, hindu, brahman, atman, fowler, claims, that, this, view, has, gained, little, support, in, buddhist, circles, fowler, asserts, that, the, authors, of, a, number, of, mahayana, texts, took, pains, to, differentiate, their, ideas, from, the, upanishadic, doctrine, of, brahman, the, spiritual, concept, of, brahman, is, far, older, in, the, vedic, literature, and, some, scholars, suggest, deity, brahma, may, have, emerged, as, a, personal, conception, and, icon, with, form, and, attributes, saguna, version, of, the, impersonal, nirguna, without, attributes, formless, universal, principle, called, brahman, in, the, hindu, texts, one, of, the, earliest, mentions, of, deity, brahma, along, with, vishnu, and, shiva, is, in, the, fifth, prapathaka, lesson, of, the, maitrayaniya, upanishad, probably, composed, in, late, 1st, millennium, bce, after, the, rise, of, buddhism, the, early, buddhists, attacked, the, concept, of, brahma, states, gananath, obeyesekere, and, thereby, polemically, attacked, the, vedic, and, upanishadic, concept, of, gender, neutral, abstract, metaphysical, brahman, this, critique, of, brahma, in, early, buddhist, texts, aims, at, ridiculing, the, vedas, but, the, same, texts, simultaneously, call, metta, loving, kindness, compassion, as, the, state, of, union, with, brahma, the, early, buddhist, approach, to, brahma, was, to, reject, any, creator, aspect, while, retaining, the, value, system, in, the, vedic, brahmavihara, concepts, in, the, buddhist, value, system, according, to, martin, wiltshire, the, term, brahma, loka, in, the, buddhist, canon, instead, of, svarga, loka, is, likely, a, buddhist, attempt, to, choose, and, emphasize, the, truth, power, and, knowledge, focus, of, the, brahman, concept, in, the, upanishads, simultaneously, by, reformulating, brahman, as, brahma, and, relegating, it, within, its, devas, and, samsara, theories, early, buddhism, rejected, the, atman, brahman, premise, of, the, vedas, to, present, its, own, dhamma, doctrines, anicca, dukkha, and, anatta, l, s, vasil, ev, writing, for, the, university, of, pennsylvania, argued, that, syncretic, taoists, used, brahman, in, their, worship, as, a, substitute, for, tao, victor, h, mair, thought, that, taoists, in, the, early, history, of, the, faith, had, positive, cultural, relations, with, hindu, groups, and, that, the, tao, te, ching, was, written, in, reaction, to, indian, philosophy, and, that, the, author, s, viewed, brahman, as, being, the, same, as, tao, the, metaphysical, concept, of, brahman, particularly, as, nirguni, brahman, attributeless, formless, eternal, highest, reality, is, at, the, foundation, of, sikhism, this, belief, is, observed, through, nirguni, bhakti, by, the, sikhs, in, gauri, which, is, part, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, brahman, is, declared, as, one, without, a, second, in, sri, rag, everything, is, born, of, him, and, is, finally, absorbed, in, him, in, var, asa, whatever, we, see, or, hear, is, the, manifestation, of, brahman, nesbitt, states, that, the, first, two, words, ik, onkar, in, the, twelve, word, mul, mantar, at, the, opening, of, the, sikh, scripture, guru, granth, sahib, has, been, translated, in, three, different, ways, by, scholars, there, is, one, god, this, being, is, one, and, as, one, reality, is, similar, emphasis, on, one, without, a, second, for, metaphysical, concept, of, brahman, is, found, in, ancient, texts, of, hinduism, such, as, the, chandogya, upanishad, s, chapter, 6, 2, the, ideas, about, god, and, highest, reality, in, sikhism, share, themes, found, in, the, saguna, and, nirguna, concepts, of, brahman, in, hinduism, the, concept, of, ultimate, reality, brahman, is, also, referred, in, sikhism, as, nam, sat, naam, or, naam, and, ik, oankar, like, hindu, om, symbolizes, this, reality, scholars, contest, whether, the, concept, of, brahman, is, rejected, or, accepted, in, jainism, the, concept, of, a, theistic, god, is, rejected, by, jainism, but, jiva, or, atman, self, exists, is, held, to, be, a, metaphysical, truth, and, central, to, its, theory, of, rebirths, and, kevala, jnana, bissett, states, that, jainism, accepts, the, material, world, and, atman, but, rejects, brahman, the, metaphysical, concept, of, ultimate, reality, and, cosmic, principles, found, in, the, ancient, texts, of, hinduism, goswami, in, contrast, states, that, the, literature, of, jainism, has, an, undercurrent, of, monist, theme, where, the, self, who, gains, the, knowledge, of, brahman, highest, reality, supreme, knowledge, is, identical, to, brahman, itself, jaini, states, that, jainism, neither, accepts, nor, rejects, the, premise, of, ultimate, reality, brahman, instead, jain, ontology, adopts, a, many, sided, doctrine, called, anekantavada, this, doctrine, holds, that, reality, is, irreducibly, complex, and, no, human, view, or, description, can, represent, the, absolute, truth, those, who, have, understood, and, realized, the, absolute, truth, are, the, liberated, ones, and, the, supreme, self, paramatman, with, kevala, jnana, brahma, is, distinct, from, brahman, brahma, is, a, male, deity, in, the, post, vedic, puranic, literature, who, creates, but, neither, preserves, nor, destroys, anything, he, is, envisioned, in, some, hindu, texts, to, have, emerged, from, the, metaphysical, brahman, along, with, vishnu, preserver, shiva, destroyer, all, other, gods, goddesses, matter, and, other, beings, brahman, is, a, metaphysical, concept, of, hinduism, referring, to, the, ultimate, unchanging, reality, that, is, uncreated, eternal, infinite, transcendent, the, cause, the, foundation, the, source, and, the, goal, of, all, existence, it, is, envisioned, as, either, the, cause, or, that, which, transforms, itself, into, everything, that, exists, in, the, universe, as, well, as, all, beings, that, which, existed, before, the, present, universe, and, time, which, exists, as, current, universe, and, time, and, that, which, will, absorb, and, exist, after, the, present, universe, and, time, ends, it, is, a, gender, neutral, abstract, concept, the, abstract, brahman, concept, is, predominant, in, the, vedic, texts, particularly, the, upanishads, while, the, deity, brahma, finds, minor, mention, in, the, vedas, and, the, upanishads, in, the, puranic, and, the, epics, literature, the, deity, brahma, appears, more, often, but, inconsistently, some, texts, suggest, that, the, god, vishnu, created, brahma, vaishnavism, others, suggest, god, shiva, created, brahma, shaivism, yet, others, suggest, goddess, devi, created, brahma, shaktism, and, these, texts, then, go, on, to, state, that, brahma, is, a, secondary, creator, of, the, world, working, respectively, on, their, behalf, a, similarity, between, brahma, and, brahman, is, that, brahman, is, said, to, be, an, anchor, for, the, world, and, the, relations, between, all, things, including, opposites, in, it, whereas, brahma, is, a, creator, god, who, aids, the, world, in, many, hindu, and, buddhist, traditions, further, the, medieval, era, texts, of, these, major, theistic, traditions, of, hinduism, assert, that, the, saguna, brahman, is, vishnu, is, shiva, or, is, devi, respectively, they, are, different, names, or, aspects, of, the, brahman, and, that, the, atman, self, within, every, living, being, is, the, same, or, part, of, this, ultimate, eternal, brahman, brahmin, is, a, varna, in, hinduism, specialising, in, theory, as, priests, preservers, and, transmitters, of, sacred, literature, across, generations, the, brahmanas, are, one, of, the, four, ancient, layers, of, texts, within, the, vedas, they, are, primarily, a, digest, incorporating, myths, legends, the, explanation, of, vedic, rituals, and, in, some, cases, philosophy, they, are, embedded, within, each, of, the, four, vedas, and, form, a, part, of, the, hindu, ruti, literature
