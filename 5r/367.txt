bali, indonesia, shiva, has, pre, vedic, tribal, roots, having, his, origins, in, primitive, tribes, signs, and, symbols, the, figure, of, shiva, as, he, is, known, today, is, an, amalgamation, of, various, older, deities, into, a, single, figure, due, to, the, process, of, sanskritization, and, the, emergence, of, the, hindu, synthesis, in, post, vedic, times, how, the, persona, of, shiva, converged, as, a, composite, deity, is, not, well, documented, a, challenge, to, trace, and, has, attracted, much, speculation, according, to, vijay, nath, vishnu, and, siva, began, to, absorb, countless, local, cults, and, deities, within, their, folds, the, latter, were, either, taken, to, represent, the, multiple, facets, of, the, same, god, or, else, were, supposed, to, denote, different, forms, and, appellations, by, which, the, god, came, to, be, known, and, worshipped, siva, became, identified, with, countless, local, cults, by, the, sheer, suffixing, of, isa, or, isvara, to, the, name, of, the, local, deity, e, g, bhutesvara, hatakesvara, chandesvara, an, example, of, assimilation, took, place, in, maharashtra, where, a, regional, deity, named, khandoba, is, a, patron, deity, of, farming, and, herding, castes, the, foremost, center, of, worship, of, khandoba, in, maharashtra, is, in, jejuri, khandoba, has, been, assimilated, as, a, form, of, shiva, himself, in, which, case, he, is, worshipped, in, the, form, of, a, lingam, khandoba, s, varied, associations, also, include, an, identification, with, surya, and, karttikeya, myths, about, shiva, that, were, roughly, contemporary, with, early, christianity, existed, that, portrayed, shiva, with, many, differences, than, how, he, is, thought, of, now, and, these, mythical, portrayals, of, shiva, were, incorporated, into, later, versions, of, him, for, instance, he, and, the, other, gods, from, the, highest, gods, to, the, least, powerful, gods, were, thought, of, as, somewhat, human, in, nature, creating, emotions, they, had, limited, control, over, and, having, the, ability, to, get, in, touch, with, their, inner, natures, through, asceticism, like, humans, in, that, era, shiva, was, widely, viewed, as, both, the, god, of, lust, and, of, asceticism, in, one, story, he, was, seduced, by, a, prostitute, sent, by, the, other, gods, who, were, jealous, of, shiva, s, ascetic, lifestyle, he, had, lived, for, 1000, years, prehistoric, rock, paintings, dating, to, the, mesolithic, from, bhimbetka, rock, shelters, have, been, interpreted, by, some, authors, as, depictions, of, shiva, however, howard, morphy, states, that, these, prehistoric, rock, paintings, of, india, when, seen, in, their, context, are, likely, those, of, hunting, party, with, animals, and, that, the, figures, in, a, group, dance, can, be, interpreted, in, many, different, ways, of, several, indus, valley, seals, that, show, animals, one, seal, that, has, attracted, attention, shows, a, large, central, figure, either, horned, or, wearing, a, horned, headdress, and, possibly, ithyphallic, seated, in, a, posture, reminiscent, of, the, lotus, position, surrounded, by, animals, this, figure, was, named, by, early, excavators, of, mohenjo, daro, as, pashupati, lord, of, animals, sanskrit, pa, upati, an, epithet, of, the, later, hindu, deities, shiva, and, rudra, sir, john, marshall, and, others, suggested, that, this, figure, is, a, prototype, of, shiva, with, three, faces, seated, in, a, yoga, posture, with, the, knees, out, and, feet, joined, semi, circular, shapes, on, the, head, were, interpreted, as, two, horns, scholars, such, as, gavin, flood, john, keay, and, doris, meth, srinivasan, have, expressed, doubts, about, this, suggestion, gavin, flood, states, that, it, is, not, clear, from, the, seal, that, the, figure, has, three, faces, is, seated, in, a, yoga, posture, or, even, that, the, shape, is, intended, to, represent, a, human, figure, he, characterizes, these, views, as, speculative, but, adds, that, it, is, nevertheless, possible, that, there, are, echoes, of, shaiva, iconographic, themes, such, as, half, moon, shapes, resembling, the, horns, of, a, bull, john, keay, writes, that, he, may, indeed, be, an, early, manifestation, of, lord, shiva, as, pashu, pati, but, a, couple, of, his, specialties, of, this, figure, does, not, match, with, rudra, writing, in, 1997, srinivasan, interprets, what, john, marshall, interpreted, as, facial, as, not, human, but, more, bovine, possibly, a, divine, buffalo, man, the, interpretation, of, the, seal, continues, to, be, disputed, mcevilley, for, example, states, that, it, is, not, possible, to, account, for, this, posture, outside, the, yogic, account, asko, parpola, states, that, other, archaeological, finds, such, as, the, early, elamite, seals, dated, to, 3000, 2750, bce, show, similar, figures, and, these, have, been, interpreted, as, seated, bull, and, not, a, yogi, and, the, bovine, interpretation, is, likely, more, accurate, gregory, l, possehl, in, 2002, associated, it, with, the, water, buffalo, and, concluded, that, while, it, would, be, appropriate, to, recognize, the, figure, as, a, deity, and, its, posture, as, one, of, ritual, discipline, regarding, it, as, a, proto, shiva, would, go, too, far, the, vedic, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, pre, classical, era, were, closely, related, to, the, hypothesised, proto, indo, european, religion, and, the, pre, islamic, indo, iranian, religion, the, similarities, between, the, iconography, and, theologies, of, shiva, with, greek, and, european, deities, have, led, to, proposals, for, an, indo, european, link, for, shiva, or, lateral, exchanges, with, ancient, central, asian, cultures, his, contrasting, aspects, such, as, being, terrifying, or, blissful, depending, on, the, situation, are, similar, to, those, of, the, greek, god, dionysus, as, are, their, iconic, associations, with, bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing, and, carefree, life, the, ancient, greek, texts, of, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, call, shiva, indian, dionysus, or, alternatively, call, dionysus, god, of, the, orient, similarly, the, use, of, phallic, symbol, as, an, icon, for, shiva, is, also, found, for, irish, nordic, greek, dionysus, and, roman, deities, as, was, the, idea, of, this, aniconic, column, linking, heaven, and, earth, among, early, indo, aryans, states, roger, woodward, others, contest, such, proposals, and, suggest, shiva, to, have, emerged, from, indigenous, pre, aryan, tribal, origins, shiva, as, we, know, him, today, shares, many, features, with, the, vedic, god, rudra, and, both, shiva, and, rudra, are, viewed, as, the, same, personality, in, hindu, scriptures, the, two, names, are, used, synonymously, rudra, a, rigvedic, deity, with, fearsome, powers, was, the, god, of, the, roaring, storm, he, is, usually, portrayed, in, accordance, with, the, element, he, represents, as, a, fierce, destructive, deity, in, rv, 2, 33, he, is, described, as, the, father, of, the, rudras, a, group, of, storm, gods, flood, notes, that, rudra, is, an, ambiguous, god, peripheral, in, the, vedic, pantheon, possibly, indicating, non, vedic, origins, nevertheless, both, rudra, and, shiva, are, akin, to, wodan, the, germanic, god, of, rage, w, tte, and, the, wild, hunt, according, to, sadasivan, during, the, development, of, the, hindu, synthesis, attributes, of, the, buddha, were, transferred, by, brahmins, to, shiva, who, was, also, linked, with, rudra, the, rigveda, has, 3, out, of, 1, 028, hymns, dedicated, to, rudra, and, he, finds, occasional, mention, in, other, hymns, of, the, same, text, hymn, 10, 92, of, the, rigveda, states, that, deity, rudra, has, two, natures, one, wild, and, cruel, rudra, another, that, is, kind, and, tranquil, shiva, the, term, shiva, also, appears, simply, as, an, epithet, that, means, kind, auspicious, one, of, the, adjectives, used, to, describe, many, different, vedic, deities, while, fierce, ruthless, natural, phenomenon, and, storm, related, rudra, is, feared, in, the, hymns, of, the, rigveda, the, beneficial, rains, he, brings, are, welcomed, as, shiva, aspect, of, him, this, healing, nurturing, life, enabling, aspect, emerges, in, the, vedas, as, rudra, shiva, and, in, post, vedic, literature, ultimately, as, shiva, who, combines, the, destructive, and, constructive, powers, the, terrific, and, the, gentle, as, the, ultimate, recycler, and, rejuvenator, of, all, existence, the, vedic, texts, do, not, mention, bull, or, any, animal, as, the, transport, vehicle, vahana, of, rudra, or, other, deities, however, post, vedic, texts, such, as, the, mahabharata, and, the, puranas, state, the, nandi, bull, the, indian, zebu, in, particular, as, the, vehicle, of, rudra, and, of, shiva, thereby, unmistakably, linking, them, as, same, rudra, and, agni, have, a, close, relationship, the, identification, between, agni, and, rudra, in, the, vedic, literature, was, an, important, factor, in, the, process, of, rudra, s, gradual, transformation, into, rudra, shiva, the, identification, of, agni, with, rudra, is, explicitly, noted, in, the, nirukta, an, important, early, text, on, etymology, which, says, agni, is, also, called, rudra, the, interconnections, between, the, two, deities, are, complex, and, according, to, stella, kramrisch, the, fire, myth, of, rudra, iva, plays, on, the, whole, gamut, of, fire, valuing, all, its, potentialities, and, phases, from, conflagration, to, illumination, in, the, atarudr, ya, some, epithets, of, rudra, such, as, sasipa, jara, of, golden, red, hue, as, of, flame, and, tiva, mati, flaming, bright, suggest, a, fusing, of, the, two, deities, agni, is, said, to, be, a, bull, and, shiva, possesses, a, bull, as, his, vehicle, nandi, the, horns, of, agni, who, is, sometimes, characterized, as, a, bull, are, mentioned, in, medieval, sculpture, both, agni, and, the, form, of, shiva, known, as, bhairava, have, flaming, hair, as, a, special, feature, according, to, wendy, doniger, the, saivite, fertility, myths, and, some, of, the, phallic, characteristics, of, shiva, are, inherited, from, indra, doniger, gives, several, reasons, for, her, hypothesis, both, are, associated, with, mountains, rivers, male, fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the, transgression, of, established, mores, the, aum, sound, the, supreme, self, in, the, rig, veda, the, term, iva, is, used, to, refer, to, indra, 2, 20, 3, 6, 45, 17, and, 8, 93, 3, indra, like, shiva, is, likened, to, a, bull, in, the, rig, veda, rudra, is, the, father, of, the, maruts, but, he, is, never, associated, with, their, warlike, exploits, as, is, indra, indra, himself, may, have, been, adopted, by, the, vedic, aryans, from, the, bactria, margiana, culture, according, to, anthony, many, of, the, qualities, of, indo, iranian, god, of, might, victory, verethraghna, were, transferred, to, the, adopted, god, indra, who, became, the, central, deity, of, the, developing, old, indic, culture, indra, was, the, subject, of, 250, hymns, a, quarter, of, the, rig, veda, he, was, associated, more, than, any, other, deity, with, soma, a, stimulant, drug, perhaps, derived, from, ephedra, probably, borrowed, from, the, bmac, religion, his, rise, to, prominence, was, a, peculiar, trait, of, the, old, indic, speakers, the, texts, and, artwork, of, jainism, show, indra, as, a, dancer, although, not, identical, generally, resembling, the, dancing, shiva, artwork, found, in, hinduism, particularly, in, their, respective, mudras, for, example, in, the, jain, caves, at, ellora, extensive, carvings, show, dancing, indra, next, to, the, images, of, tirthankaras, in, a, manner, similar, to, shiva, nataraja, the, similarities, in, the, dance, iconography, suggests, that, there, may, be, a, link, between, ancient, indra, and, shiva, a, few, texts, such, as, atharvashiras, upanishad, mention, rudra, and, assert, all, gods, are, rudra, everyone, and, everything, is, rudra, and, rudra, is, the, principle, found, in, all, things, their, highest, goal, the, innermost, essence, of, all, reality, that, is, visible, or, invisible, the, kaivalya, upanishad, similarly, states, paul, deussen, a, german, indologist, and, professor, of, philosophy, describes, the, self, realized, man, as, who, feels, himself, only, as, the, one, divine, essence, that, lives, in, all, who, feels, identity, of, his, and, everyone, s, consciousness, with, shiva, highest, atman, who, has, found, this, highest, atman, within, in, the, depths, of, his, heart, rudra, s, evolution, from, a, minor, vedic, deity, to, a, supreme, being, is, first, evidenced, in, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, 400, 200, bce, according, to, gavin, flood, presenting, the, earliest, seeds, of, theistic, devotion, to, rudra, shiva, here, rudra, shiva, is, identified, as, the, creator, of, the, cosmos, and, liberator, of, selfs, from, the, birth, rebirth, cycle, the, svetasvatara, upanishad, set, the, tone, for, early, shaivite, thought, especially, in, chapter, 3, verse, 2, where, shiva, is, equated, with, brahman, rudra, is, truly, one, for, the, knowers, of, brahman, do, not, admit, the, existence, of, a, second, the, period, of, 200, bc, to, 100, ad, also, marks, the, beginning, of, the, shaiva, tradition, focused, on, the, worship, of, shiva, as, evidenced, in, other, literature, of, this, period, other, scholars, such, as, robert, hume, and, doris, srinivasan, state, that, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, presents, pluralism, pantheism, or, henotheism, rather, than, being, a, text, just, on, shiva, theism, self, realization, and, shaiva, upanishads, he, who, sees, himself, in, all, beings, and, all, beings, in, him, attains, the, highest, brahman, not, by, any, other, means, kaivalya, upanishad, 10, shaiva, devotees, and, ascetics, are, mentioned, in, patanjali, s, mah, bh, ya, 2nd, century, bce, and, in, the, mahabharata, the, earliest, iconic, artworks, of, shiva, may, be, from, gandhara, and, northwest, parts, of, ancient, india, there, is, some, uncertainty, as, the, artwork, that, has, survived, is, damaged, and, they, show, some, overlap, with, meditative, buddha, related, artwork, but, the, presence, of, shiva, s, trident, and, phallic, symbolism, in, this, art, suggests, it, was, likely, shiva, numismatics, research, suggests, that, numerous, coins, of, the, ancient, kushan, empire, 30, 375, ce, that, have, survived, were, images, of, a, god, who, is, probably, shiva, the, shiva, in, kushan, coins, is, referred, to, as, oesho, of, unclear, etymology, and, origins, but, the, simultaneous, presence, of, indra, and, shiva, in, the, kushan, era, artwork, suggest, that, they, were, revered, deities, by, the, start, of, the, kushan, empire, the, shaiva, upanishads, are, a, group, of, 14, minor, upanishads, of, hinduism, variously, dated, from, the, last, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, through, the, 17th, century, these, extol, shiva, as, the, metaphysical, unchanging, reality, brahman, and, the, atman, self, and, include, sections, about, rites, and, symbolisms, related, to, shiva, the, shaiva, puranas, particularly, the, shiva, purana, and, the, linga, purana, present, the, various, aspects, of, shiva, mythologies, cosmology, and, pilgrimage, tirtha, associated, with, him, the, shiva, related, tantra, literature, composed, between, the, 8th, and, 11th, centuries, are, regarded, in, devotional, dualistic, shaivism, as, sruti, dualistic, shaiva, agamas, which, consider, self, within, each, living, being, and, shiva, as, two, separate, realities, dualism, dvaita, are, the, foundational, texts, for, shaiva, siddhanta, other, shaiva, agamas, teach, that, these, are, one, reality, monism, advaita, and, that, shiva, is, the, self, the, perfection, and, truth, within, each, living, being, in, shiva, related, sub, traditions, there, are, ten, dualistic, agama, texts, eighteen, qualified, monism, cum, dualism, agama, texts, and, sixty, four, monism, agama, texts, shiva, related, literature, developed, extensively, across, india, in, the, 1st, millennium, ce, and, through, the, 13th, century, particularly, in, kashmir, and, tamil, shaiva, traditions, shaivism, gained, immense, popularity, in, tamilakam, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, ce, with, poets, such, as, appar, and, sambandar, composing, rich, poetry, that, is, replete, with, present, features, associated, with, the, deity, such, as, his, tandava, dance, the, mulavam, dumru, the, aspect, of, holding, fire, and, restraining, the, proud, flow, of, the, ganga, upon, his, braid, the, monist, shiva, literature, posit, absolute, oneness, that, is, shiva, is, within, every, man, and, woman, shiva, is, within, every, living, being, shiva, is, present, everywhere, in, the, world, including, all, non, living, being, and, there, is, no, spiritual, difference, between, life, matter, man, and, shiva, the, various, dualistic, and, monist, shiva, related, ideas, were, welcomed, in, medieval, southeast,

revere, shiva, as, the, supreme, being, shaivas, believe, that, shiva, is, all, and, in, all, the, creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer, and, concealer, of, all, that, is, he, is, not, only, the, creator, in, shaivism, but, he, is, also, the, creation, that, results, from, him, he, is, everything, and, everywhere, shiva, is, the, primal, self, the, pure, consciousness, and, absolute, reality, in, the, shaiva, traditions, shiva, is, also, part, of, om, as, a, u, the, shaivism, theology, is, broadly, grouped, into, two, the, popular, theology, influenced, by, shiva, rudra, in, the, vedas,

is, typically, present, in, its, sanctum, sanctorum, and, is, the, focus, of, votary, offerings, such, as, milk, water, flower, petals, fruit, fresh, leaves, and, rice, according, to, monier, williams, and, yudit, greenberg, linga, literally, means, mark, sign, or, emblem, and, also, refers, to, a, mark, or, sign, from, which, the, existence, of, something, else, can, be, reliably, inferred, it, implies, the, regenerative, divine, energy, innate, in, nature, symbolized, by, shiva, some, scholars, such, as, wendy, doniger, view, linga, as, merely, a, phallic, symbol, although, this, interpretation, is, criticized, by, others, including, swami, vivekananda, sivananda, saraswati, stella, kramrisch, swami, agehananda, bharati, s, n, balagangadhara, and, others, according, to, moriz, winternitz, the, linga, in, the, shiva, tradition, is, only, a, symbol, of, the, productive, and, creative, principle, of, nature, as, embodied, in, shiva, and, it, has, no, historical, trace, in, any, obscene, phallic, cult, according, to, sivananda, saraswati, westerners, who, are, curiously, passionate, and, have, impure, understanding, or, intelligence, incorrectly, assume, siva, linga, as, a, phallus, or, sex, organ, later, on, sivananda, saraswati, mentions, that, this, is, not, only, a, serious, mistake, but, also, a, grave, blunder, the, worship, of, the, lingam, originated, from, the, famous, hymn, in, the, atharva, veda, samhit, sung, in, praise, of, the, yupa, stambha, the, sacrificial, post, in, that, hymn, a, description, is, found, of, the, beginningless, and, endless, stambha, or, skambha, and, it, is, shown, that, the, said, skambha, is, put, in, place, of, the, eternal, brahman, just, as, the, yajna, sacrificial, fire, its, smoke, ashes, and, flames, the, soma, plant, and, the, ox, that, used, to, carry, on, its, back, the, wood, for, the, vedic, sacrifice, gave, place, to, the, conceptions, of, the, brightness, of, shiva, s, body, his, tawny, matted, hair, his, blue, throat, and, the, riding, on, the, bull, of, the, shiva, the, yupa, skambha, gave, place, in, time, to, the, shiva, linga, in, the, text, linga, purana, the, same, hymn, is,

and, these, are, located, across, india, puranic, scriptures, contain, occasional, references, to, ansh, literally, portion, or, avatars, of, shiva, but, the, idea, of, shiva, avatars, is, not, universally, accepted, in, shaivism, the, linga, purana, mentions, twenty, eight, forms, of, shiva, which, are, sometimes, seen, as, avatars, however, such, mention, is, unusual, and, the, avatars, of, shiva, is, relatively, rare, in, shaivism, compared, to, the, well, emphasized, concept, of, vishnu, avatars, in, vaishnavism, some, vaishnava, literature, reverentially, link, shiva, to, characters, in, its, puranas, for, example, in, the, hanuman, chalisa, hanuman, is, identified, as, the, eleventh, avatar, of, shiva, the, bhagavata, purana, and, the, vishnu, purana, claim, sage,
