a, fallacy, is, the, use, of, invalid, or, otherwise, faulty, reasoning, in, the, construction, of, an, argument, that, may, appear, to, be, well, reasoned, if, unnoticed, the, term, was, introduced, in, the, western, intellectual, tradition, by, the, aristotelian, de, sophisticis, elenchis, fallacies, may, be, committed, intentionally, to, manipulate, or, persuade, by, deception, unintentionally, because, of, human, limitations, such, as, carelessness, cognitive, or, social, biases, and, ignorance, or, potentially, due, to, the, limitations, of, language, and, understanding, of, language, these, delineations, include, not, only, the, ignorance, of, the, right, reasoning, standard, but, also, the, ignorance, of, relevant, properties, of, the, context, for, instance, the, soundness, of, legal, arguments, depends, on, the, context, in, which, they, are, made, fallacies, are, commonly, divided, into, formal, and, informal, a, formal, fallacy, is, a, flaw, in, the, structure, of, a, deductive, argument, that, renders, the, argument, invalid, while, an, informal, fallacy, originates, in, an, error, in, reasoning, other, than, an, improper, logical, form, arguments, containing, informal, fallacies, may, be, formally, valid, but, still, fallacious, a, special, case, is, a, mathematical, fallacy, an, intentionally, invalid, mathematical, proof, with, a, concealed, or, subtle, error, mathematical, fallacies, are, typically, crafted, and, exhibited, for, educational, purposes, usually, taking, the, form, of, false, proofs, of, obvious, contradictions, fallacies, are, types, of, erroneous, reasoning, that, render, arguments, logically, unsound, according, to, the, new, handbook, of, cognitive, therapy, techniques, they, include, unsubstantiated, assertions, that, are, often, delivered, with, a, conviction, that, makes, them, sound, as, though, they, are, proven, facts, informal, fallacies, in, particular, are, frequently, found, in, mass, media, such, as, television, and, newspapers, understanding, fallacies, may, allow, one, to, recognize, them, in, either, one, s, own, or, others, writing, avoiding, fallacies, may, help, improve, one, s, ability, to, produce, sound, arguments, it, can, be, difficult, to, evaluate, whether, an, argument, is, fallacious, as, arguments, exist, along, a, continuum, of, soundness, and, an, argument, that, has, several, stages, or, parts, might, have, some, sound, sections, and, some, fallacious, ones, moreover, whether, a, specific, argument, is, fallacious, often, depends, on, the, content, rather, than, the, form, of, the, argument, an, example, is, a, probabilistically, valid, instance, of, the, formally, invalid, argument, form, of, denying, the, antecedent, or, affirming, the, consequent, thus, fallacious, arguments, usually, have, the, deceptive, appearance, of, being, good, arguments, because, for, most, fallacious, instances, of, an, argument, form, a, similar, but, non, fallacious, instance, can, be, found, evaluating, an, instance, of, an, argument, as, fallacious, is, therefore, often, a, matter, of, evaluating, the, context, of, the, argument, recognizing, fallacies, in, everyday, arguments, may, be, difficult, since, arguments, are, often, embedded, in, rhetorical, patterns, that, obscure, the, logical, connections, between, statements, informal, fallacies, may, also, exploit, the, emotional, intellectual, or, psychological, weaknesses, of, the, audience, recognizing, fallacies, can, develop, reasoning, skills, to, expose, the, weaker, links, between, premises, and, conclusions, to, better, discern, between, what, appears, to, be, true, and, what, is, true, argumentation, theory, provides, a, different, approach, to, understanding, and, classifying, fallacies, in, the, pragma, dialectical, theory, for, instance, an, argument, is, regarded, as, an, interactive, protocol, between, individuals, who, attempt, to, resolve, their, disagreement, on, the, merits, of, a, case, the, protocol, consists, of, normative, rules, of, interaction, and, violations, of, these, rules, are, considered, fallacies, because, they, frustrate, the, attempt, at, resolving, the, disagreement, fallacies, are, used, in, place, of, valid, reasoning, to, communicate, a, point, with, the, intention, to, persuade, examples, in, the, mass, media, today, include, but, are, not, limited, to, propaganda, advertisements, politics, newspaper, editorials, and, opinion, based, news, shows, fallacies, are, generally, classified, strictly, by, either, their, structure, or, their, content, such, as, by, classifying, them, as, formal, fallacies, or, informal, fallacies, respectively, the, classification, of, informal, fallacies, may, be, subdivided, into, categories, such, as, linguistic, relevance, through, omission, relevance, through, intrusion, and, relevance, through, presumption, alternatively, fallacies, may, be, classified, by, the, process, by, which, they, occur, such, as, material, fallacies, content, verbal, fallacies, linguistic, and, formal, fallacies, error, in, inference, in, turn, material, fallacies, may, be, placed, into, the, more, general, category, of, informal, fallacies, verbal, fallacies, may, be, placed, in, either, formal, or, informal, classifications, compare, equivocation, which, is, a, word, or, phrase, based, ambiguity, to, the, fallacy, of, composition, which, is, premise, and, inference, based, ambiguity, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, was, the, first, to, systematize, logical, errors, into, a, list, to, make, it, easier, to, refute, an, opponent, s, thesis, and, thus, win, an, argument, 2, aristotle, s, sophistical, refutations, de, sophisticis, elenchis, identifies, thirteen, fallacies, he, divided, them, up, into, two, major, types, linguistic, fallacies, and, non, linguistic, fallacies, some, of, which, depend, on, language, and, others, that, do, not, these, fallacies, are, called, verbal, fallacies, and, material, fallacies, respectively, a, material, fallacy, is, an, error, in, what, the, arguer, is, talking, about, while, a, verbal, fallacy, is, an, error, in, how, the, arguer, is, talking, verbal, fallacies, are, those, in, which, a, conclusion, is, obtained, by, improper, or, ambiguous, use, of, words, an, example, of, a, language, dependent, fallacy, is, given, as, a, debate, as, to, who, in, humanity, are, learners, the, wise, or, the, ignorant, 3, a, language, independent, fallacy, is, for, example, indian, logicians, took, great, pains, to, identify, fallacies, in, arguments, an, influential, collection, of, texts, on, logic, and, reason, the, ny, ya, s, tras, attributed, to, aksapada, gautama, variously, estimated, to, have, been, composed, between, the, 6th, century, bce, and, the, 2nd, century, ce, lists, in, its, theory, of, inference, five, such, reasons, used, in, an, argument, that, was, further, developed, by, later, logicians, english, scholar, and, theologian, richard, whately, 1787, 1863, defines, a, fallacy, broadly, as, any, argument, or, apparent, argument, which, professes, to, be, decisive, of, the, matter, at, hand, while, in, reality, it, is, not, 8, whately, divided, fallacies, into, two, groups, logical, and, material, according, to, whately, logical, fallacies, are, arguments, where, the, conclusion, does, not, follow, from, the, premises, material, fallacies, are, not, logical, errors, because, the, conclusion, follows, from, the, premises, he, then, divided, the, logical, group, into, two, groups, purely, logical, and, semi, logical, the, semi, logical, group, included, all, of, aristotle, s, sophisms, except, ignoratio, elenchi, petitio, principii, and, non, causa, pro, causa, which, are, in, the, material, group, other, famous, methods, of, classifying, fallacies, are, those, of, francis, bacon, and, j, s, mill, bacon, novum, organum, aph, 33, 38, sqq, divided, fallacies, into, four, idola, idols, i, e, false, appearances, which, summarize, the, various, kinds, of, mistakes, to, which, the, human, intellect, is, prone, j, s, mill, discussed, the, subject, in, book, five, of, his, logic, and, jeremy, bentham, s, book, of, fallacies, 1824, contains, valuable, remarks, a, formal, fallacy, deductive, fallacy, logical, fallacy, or, non, sequitur, latin, for, it, does, not, follow, is, a, flaw, in, the, structure, of, a, deductive, argument, that, renders, the, argument, invalid, the, flaw, can, be, expressed, in, the, standard, system, of, logic, such, an, argument, is, always, considered, to, be, wrong, the, presence, of, the, formal, fallacy, does, not, imply, anything, about, the, argument, s, premises, or, its, conclusion, both, may, actually, be, true, or, may, even, be, more, probable, as, a, result, of, the, argument, but, the, deductive, argument, is, still, invalid, because, the, conclusion, does, not, follow, from, the, premises, in, the, manner, described, even, non, deductive, arguments, can, be, said, to, be, fallacious, for, example, an, inductive, argument, that, incorrectly, applies, principles, of, probability, or, causality, but, since, deductive, arguments, depend, on, formal, properties, and, inductive, arguments, don, t, formal, fallacies, apply, only, to, deductive, arguments, a, logical, form, such, as, a, and, b, is, independent, of, any, particular, conjunction, of, meaningful, propositions, logical, form, alone, can, guarantee, that, given, true, premises, a, true, conclusion, must, follow, however, formal, logic, makes, no, such, guarantee, if, any, premise, is, false, the, conclusion, can, be, either, true, or, false, any, formal, error, or, logical, fallacy, similarly, invalidates, the, deductive, guarantee, both, the, argument, and, all, its, premises, must, be, true, for, a, conclusion, to, be, true, the, term, logical, fallacy, is, in, a, sense, self, contradictory, because, logic, refers, to, valid, reasoning, whereas, a, fallacy, is, the, use, of, poor, reasoning, therefore, the, term, formal, fallacy, is, preferred, in, informal, discourse, however, logical, fallacy, is, used, to, mean, an, argument, that, is, problematic, for, any, reason, the, term, non, sequitur, denotes, a, general, formal, fallacy, often, meaning, one, that, does, not, belong, to, any, named, subclass, of, formal, fallacies, like, affirming, the, consequent, an, ecological, fallacy, is, committed, when, one, draws, an, inference, from, data, based, on, the, premise, that, qualities, observed, for, groups, necessarily, hold, for, individuals, for, example, if, countries, with, more, protestants, tend, to, have, higher, suicide, rates, then, protestants, must, be, more, likely, to, commit, suicide, maarten, boudry, and, others, have, argued, that, formal, deductive, fallacies, rarely, occur, in, real, life, and, that, arguments, that, would, be, fallacious, in, formally, deductive, terms, are, not, necessarily, so, when, context, and, prior, probabilities, are, taken, into, account, thus, making, the, argument, defeasible, and, or, inductive, boudry, coined, the, term, fallacy, fork, for, a, given, fallacy, one, must, either, characterize, it, by, means, of, a, deductive, argumentation, scheme, which, rarely, applies, the, first, prong, of, the, fork, or, one, must, relax, definitions, and, add, nuance, to, take, the, actual, intent, and, context, of, the, argument, into, account, the, other, prong, of, the, fork, to, argue, for, example, that, one, became, nauseated, after, eating, a, mushroom, because, the, mushroom, was, poisonous, could, be, an, example, of, the, post, hoc, ergo, propter, hoc, fallacy, in, contrast, to, a, formal, fallacy, an, informal, fallacy, originates, from, a, reasoning, error, other, than, a, flaw, in, the, logical, form, of, the, argument, a, deductive, argument, containing, an, informal, fallacy, may, be, formally, valid, but, still, remain, rationally, unpersuasive, nevertheless, informal, fallacies, apply, to, both, deductive, and, non, deductive, arguments, though, the, form, of, the, argument, may, be, relevant, fallacies, of, this, type, are, types, of, mistakes, in, reasoning, that, arise, from, the, mishandling, of, the, content, of, the, propositions, constituting, the, argument, a, special, subclass, of, the, informal, fallacies, is, the, set, of, faulty, generalizations, also, known, as, inductive, fallacies, here, the, most, important, issue, concerns, inductive, strength, or, methodology, for, example, statistical, inference, in, the, absence, of, sufficient, evidence, drawing, conclusions, based, on, induction, is, unwarranted, and, fallacious, with, the, backing, of, sufficient, amounts, of, the, right, type, of, empirical, evidence, however, the, conclusions, may, become, warranted, and, convincing, at, which, point, the, arguments, are, no, longer, considered, fallacious, hasty, generalization, is, described, as, making, assumptions, about, a, whole, group, or, range, of, cases, based, on, a, sample, that, is, inadequate, usually, because, it, is, atypical, or, just, too, small, stereotypes, about, people, frat, boys, are, drunkards, grad, students, are, nerdy, women, don, t, enjoy, sports, etc, are, common, examples, of, the, principle, hasty, generalization, often, follows, a, pattern, such, as, while, never, a, valid, logical, deduction, if, such, an, inference, can, be, made, on, statistical, grounds, it, may, nonetheless, be, convincing, this, is, because, with, enough, empirical, evidence, the, generalization, is, no, longer, a, hasty, one, the, fallacies, of, relevance, are, a, broad, class, of, informal, fallacies, generically, represented, by, missing, the, point, presenting, an, argument, that, may, be, sound, but, fails, to, address, the, issue, in, question, an, argument, from, silence, is, a, faulty, conclusion, that, is, drawn, based, on, the, absence, of, evidence, rather, than, on, the, presence, of, evidence, the, post, hoc, fallacy, assumes, that, because, b, comes, after, a, a, caused, b, it, gets, its, name, from, the, latin, phrase, post, hoc, ergo, propter, hoc, which, translates, as, after, this, therefore, because, of, this, sometimes, one, event, really, does, cause, another, one, that, comes, later, for, example, if, one, registers, for, a, class, and, their, name, later, appears, on, the, roll, it, s, true, that, the, first, event, caused, the, one, that, came, later, but, sometimes, two, events, that, seem, related, in, time, are, not, really, related, as, cause, and, event, that, is, temporal, correlation, does, not, necessarily, entail, causation, for, example, if, one, eats, a, sandwich, and, then, gets, food, poisoning, that, does, not, necessarily, mean, the, sandwich, caused, the, food, poisoning, something, else, eaten, earlier, might, have, caused, the, food, poisoning, for, an, argument, to, be, a, slippery, slope, type, of, argument, it, must, meet, the, requirements, of, that, argumentation, scheme, a, slippery, slope, argument, originates, from, a, conversation, or, debate, in, which, two, actors, take, turns, it, usually, originates, from, one, actor, giving, advice, on, a, decision, or, act, along, the, way, the, actor, must, make, additional, choices, on, similar, matters, through, which, the, actor, enters, the, grey, area, of, the, slippery, slope, at, this, point, the, actor, potentially, loses, control, over, the, direction, of, the, arguments, thus, leading, to, a, fatal, outcome, such, an, argument, is, built, up, according, to, the, following, argumentation, scheme, initial, premise, sequential, premise, indeterminacy, premise, control, premise, loss, of, control, premise, catastrophic, outcome, premise, and, conclusion, slippery, slope, arguments, may, be, defeated, by, asking, critical, questions, or, giving, counterarguments, there, are, several, reasons, for, a, slippery, slope, to, be, fallacious, for, example, the, argument, is, going, too, far, into, the, future, it, is, a, too, complex, argument, whose, structure, is, hard, to, identify, or, the, argument, makes, emotional, appeals, it, may, be, that, a, slippery, slope, is, not, necessarily, fallacious, if, context, is, taken, into, account, and, there, is, an, effort, to, assess, plausibility, informally, known, as, the, apples, and, oranges, fallacy, a, false, analogy, uses, unsound, comparisons, the, straw, man, fallacy, refers, to, the, refutation, of, a, standpoint, in, an, argument, that, was, never, proposed, the, fallacy, usually, occurs, in, the, presentation, of, an, opponent, s, standpoint, as, more, extreme, distorted, or, simplistic, than, it, actually, is, compared, to, criticizing, the, opponent, s, actual, standpoint, this, allows, the, arguer, to, offer, a, seeming, refutation, of, what, is, however, not, the, actual, standpoint, such, an, argument, involves, two, arguers, with, one, criticizing, the, other, s, perspective, the, reason, for, the, straw, man, argument, to, be, fallacious, originates, from, the, problem, of, how, to, deal, with, natural, discourse, the, opponent, s, argument, is, not, reflected, by, the, arguments, that, are, proposed, by, the, speaker, some, of, the, fallacies, described, above, may, be, committed, in, the, context, of, measurement, where, mathematical, fallacies, are, subtle, mistakes, in, reasoning, leading, to, invalid, mathematical, proofs, measurement, fallacies, are, unwarranted, inferential, leaps, involved, in, the, extrapolation, of, raw, data, to, a, measurement, based, value, claim, the, ancient, greek, sophist, protagoras, was, one, of, the, first, thinkers, to, propose, that, humans, can, generate, reliable, measurements, through, his, human, measure, principle, and, the, practice, of, dissoi, logoi, arguing, multiple, sides, of, an, issue, this, history, helps, explain, why, measurement, fallacies, are, informed, by, informal, logic, and, argumentation, theory, the, increasing, availability, and, circulation, of, big, data, are, driving, a, proliferation, of, new, metrics, for, scholarly, authority, and, there, is, lively, discussion, regarding, the, relative, usefulness, of, such, metrics, for, measuring, the, value, of, knowledge, production, in, the, context, of, an, information, tsunami, for, example, anchoring, fallacies, can, occur, when, unwarranted, weight, is, given, to, data, generated, by, metrics, that, the, arguers, themselves, acknowledge, are, flawed, for, example, the, limitations, of, the, journal, impact, factor, jif, are, well, documented, and, even, jif, pioneer, eugene, garfield, notes, that, while, citation, data, create, new, tools, for, analyses, of, research, performance, it, should, be, stressed, that, they, supplement, rather, than, replace, other, quantitative, and, qualitative, indicators, to, the, extent, that, arguers, jettison, the, acknowledged, limitations, of, jif, generated, data, in, evaluative, judgments, or, leave, behind, garfield, s, supplement, rather, than, replace, caveat, they, commit, anchoring, fallacies, a, naturalistic, fallacy, can, occur, for, example, in, the, case, of, sheer, quantity, metrics, based, on, the, premise, more, is, better, or, in, the, case, of, developmental, assessment, in, the, field, of, psychology, higher, is, better, a, false, analogy, occurs, when, claims, are, supported, by, unsound, comparisons, between, data, points, for, example, the, scopus, and, web, of, science, bibliographic, databases, have, difficulty, distinguishing, between, citations, of, scholarly, work, that, are, arms, length, endorsements, ceremonial, citations, or, negative, citations, indicating, the, citing, author, withholds, endorsement, of, the, cited, work, hence, measurement, based, value, claims, premised, on, the, uniform, quality, of, all, citations, may, be, questioned, on, false, analogy, grounds, as, another, example, consider, the, faculty, scholarly, productivity, index, of, academic, analytics, this, tool, purports, to, measure, overall, faculty, productivity, yet, it, does, not, capture, data, based, on, citations, in, books, this, creates, a, possibility, that, low, productivity, measurements, using, the, tool, commit, argument, from, silence, fallacies, to, the, extent, that, such, measurements, are, supported, by, the, absence, of, book, citation, data, ecological, fallacies, can, be, committed, when, one, measures, the, scholarly, productivity, of, a, sub, group, of, individuals, e, g, puerto, rican, faculty, via, reference, to, aggregate, data, about, a, larger, and, different, group, e, g, hispanic, faculty, sometimes, a, speaker, or, writer, uses, a, fallacy, intentionally, in, any, context, including, academic, debate, a, conversation, among, friends, political, discourse, advertising, or, comedic, purposes, the, arguer, may, use, fallacious, reasoning, to, try, to, persuade, the, listener, or, reader, by, means, other, than, offering, relevant, evidence, that, the, conclusion, is, true, examples, of, this, include, the, speaker, or, writer, in, humor, errors, of, reasoning, are, used, for, comical, purposes, groucho, marx, used, fallacies, of, amphiboly, for, instance, to, make, ironic, statements, gary, larson, and, scott, adams, employed, fallacious, reasoning, in, many, of, their, cartoons, wes, boyer, and, samuel, stoddard, have, written, a, humorous, essay, teaching, students, how, to, be, persuasive, by, means, of, a, whole, host, of, informal, and, formal, fallacies, when, someone, uses, logical, fallacies, intentionally, to, mislead, in, academic, political, or, other, high, stakes, contexts, the, breach, of, trust, calls, into, question, the, authority, and, intellectual, integrity, of, that, person, according, to, the, pragmatic, theory, a, fallacy, can, be, either, a, heuristic, error, or, a, ploy, used, intentionally, to, unfairly, win, an, argument, there, are, always, two, parties, to, an, argument, containing, a, fallacy, the, perpetrator, and, the, intended, victim, the, dialogue, framework, required, to, support, the, pragmatic, theory, of, fallacy, is, built, on, the, presumption, that, argumentative, dialogue, has, both, an, adversarial, component, and, a, collaborative, component, a, dialogue, has, individual, goals, for, each, participant, as, well, as, shared, goals, that, apply, to, all, participants, a, fallacy, of, the, second, kind, is, seen, as, more, than, simply, a, violation, of, the, rule, of, reasonable, dialogue, it, is, also, a, deceptive, tactic, of, argumentation, based, on, sleight, of, hand, aristotle, explicitly, compared, contentious, reasoning, to, unfair, fighting, in, athletic, contests, but, the, roots, of, the, pragmatic, theory, go, back, even, further, in, history, to, the, sophists, the, pragmatic, theory, finds, its, roots, in, the, aristotelian, conception, of, a, fallacy, as, a, sophistical, refutation, but, also, supports, the, view, that, many, of, the, types, of, arguments, traditionally, labeled, as, fallacies, are, in, fact, reasonable, techniques, of, argumentation, that, can, be, used, in, many, cases, to, support, legitimate, goals, of, dialogue, hence, under, the, pragmatic, approach, each, case, needs, to, be, analyzed, individually, to, determine, whether, the, argument, is, fallacious, or, reasonable, concepts, works
