reformed, christianity, also, called, calvinism, is, a, major, branch, of, protestantism, that, began, during, the, sixteenth, century, protestant, reformation, a, schism, in, the, western, church, in, the, modern, day, it, is, largely, represented, by, the, continental, presbyterian, and, congregational, traditions, as, well, as, parts, of, the, anglican, and, baptist, traditions, a, foundational, event, that, divided, the, reformed, from, the, lutheran, tradition, occurred, in, 1529, when, reformer, huldrych, zwingli, of, z, rich, broke, with, martin, luther, on, the, topic, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, zwingli, believing, jesus, christ, is, spiritually, present, but, not, corporally, physically, present, a, separate, reformed, tradition, developed, over, several, generations, especially, in, switzerland, scotland, and, the, netherlands, in, the, seventeenth, century, jacobus, arminius, and, the, remonstrants, were, expelled, from, the, dutch, reformed, church, over, disputes, regarding, predestination, and, salvation, and, from, that, time, arminians, are, usually, considered, to, be, a, distinct, tradition, from, the, reformed, this, dispute, produced, the, canons, of, dort, the, basis, for, the, doctrines, of, grace, or, five, points, of, calvinism, reformed, theology, emphasizes, the, authority, of, the, bible, the, sovereignty, of, god, and, covenant, theology, a, framework, for, understanding, the, bible, based, on, god, s, covenants, with, people, reformed, churches, have, emphasized, simplicity, in, worship, several, forms, of, ecclesiastical, polity, are, exercised, by, reformed, churches, including, presbyterian, congregational, and, some, episcopal, christianity, protestantism, reformed, christianity, is, often, called, calvinism, after, john, calvin, influential, reformer, of, geneva, the, term, was, first, used, by, opposing, lutherans, in, the, 1550s, calvin, did, not, approve, of, the, use, of, this, term, and, scholars, have, argued, that, use, of, the, term, is, misleading, inaccurate, unhelpful, and, inherently, distortive, the, definitions, and, boundaries, of, the, terms, reformed, christianity, and, calvinism, are, contested, by, scholars, as, a, historical, movement, reformed, christianity, began, during, the, reformation, with, huldrych, zwingli, in, z, rich, switzerland, following, the, failure, of, the, marburg, colloquy, between, zwingli, s, followers, and, those, of, martin, luther, in, 1529, to, mediate, disputes, regarding, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, lord, s, supper, reformed, protestants, were, defined, by, their, opposition, to, lutherans, the, reformed, also, opposed, anabaptist, radicals, thus, remaining, within, the, magisterial, reformation, during, the, seventeenth, century, arminian, controversy, followers, of, jacobus, arminius, were, forcibly, removed, from, the, dutch, reformed, church, for, their, views, regarding, predestination, and, salvation, and, thenceforth, arminians, would, be, considered, outside, the, pale, of, reformed, orthodoxy, though, some, use, the, term, reformed, to, include, arminians, while, using, the, term, calvinist, to, exclude, arminians, reformed, christianity, also, has, a, complicated, relationship, with, anglicanism, the, branch, of, protestantism, originating, in, the, church, of, england, the, anglican, confessions, are, considered, reformed, and, leaders, of, the, english, reformation, were, influenced, by, reformed, rather, than, lutheran, theologians, but, the, church, of, england, retained, elements, of, catholicism, such, as, bishops, and, vestments, unlike, most, reformed, churches, and, thus, was, sometimes, called, but, halfly, reformed, beginning, in, the, seventeenth, century, anglicanism, broadened, to, the, extent, that, reformed, theology, is, no, longer, dominant, in, anglicanism, anglicanism, is, generally, classified, as, a, discrete, tradition, from, reformed, some, scholars, argue, that, reformed, baptists, who, hold, many, of, the, same, beliefs, as, reformed, christians, but, not, infant, baptism, should, be, considered, part, of, reformed, christianity, though, this, would, not, have, been, the, view, of, early, modern, reformed, theologians, others, disagree, asserting, that, baptists, should, be, considered, a, separate, religious, tradition, the, first, wave, of, reformed, theologians, included, huldrych, zwingli, 1484, 1531, martin, bucer, 1491, 1551, wolfgang, capito, 1478, 1541, john, oecolampadius, 1482, 1531, and, guillaume, farel, 1489, 1565, while, from, diverse, academic, backgrounds, their, work, already, contained, key, themes, within, reformed, theology, especially, the, priority, of, scripture, as, a, source, of, authority, scripture, was, also, viewed, as, a, unified, whole, which, led, to, a, covenantal, theology, of, the, sacraments, of, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, as, visible, signs, of, the, covenant, of, grace, another, shared, perspective, was, their, denial, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, each, understood, salvation, to, be, by, grace, alone, and, affirmed, a, doctrine, of, unconditional, election, the, teaching, that, some, people, are, chosen, by, god, to, be, saved, martin, luther, and, his, successor, philipp, melanchthon, were, significant, influences, on, these, theologians, and, to, a, larger, extent, those, who, followed, the, doctrine, of, justification, by, faith, alone, also, known, as, sola, fide, was, a, direct, inheritance, from, luther, the, second, generation, featured, john, calvin, 1509, 1564, heinrich, bullinger, 1504, 1575, thomas, cranmer, 1489, 1556, wolfgang, musculus, 1497, 1563, peter, martyr, vermigli, 1500, 1562, andreas, hyperius, 1511, 1564, and, john, lasco, 1499, 1560, written, between, 1536, and, 1539, calvin, s, institutes, of, the, christian, religion, was, one, of, the, most, influential, works, of, the, era, toward, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, these, beliefs, were, formed, into, one, consistent, creed, which, would, shape, the, future, definition, of, the, reformed, faith, the, 1549, consensus, tigurinus, unified, zwingli, and, bullinger, s, memorialist, theology, of, the, eucharist, which, taught, that, it, was, simply, a, reminder, of, christ, s, death, with, calvin, s, view, of, it, as, a, means, of, grace, with, christ, actually, present, though, spiritually, rather, than, bodily, as, in, catholic, doctrine, the, document, demonstrates, the, diversity, as, well, as, unity, in, early, reformed, theology, giving, it, a, stability, that, enabled, it, to, spread, rapidly, throughout, europe, this, stands, in, marked, contrast, to, the, bitter, controversy, experienced, by, lutherans, prior, to, the, 1579, formula, of, concord, due, to, calvin, s, missionary, work, in, france, his, program, of, reform, eventually, reached, the, french, speaking, provinces, of, the, netherlands, calvinism, was, adopted, in, the, electorate, of, the, palatinate, under, frederick, iii, which, led, to, the, formulation, of, the, heidelberg, catechism, in, 1563, this, and, the, belgic, confession, were, adopted, as, confessional, standards, in, the, first, synod, of, the, dutch, reformed, church, in, 1571, in, 1573, william, the, silent, joined, the, calvinist, church, calvinism, was, declared, the, official, religion, of, the, kingdom, of, navarre, by, the, queen, regnant, jeanne, d, albret, after, her, conversion, in, 1560, leading, divines, either, calvinist, or, those, sympathetic, to, calvinism, settled, in, england, including, martin, bucer, peter, martyr, and, john, aski, as, did, john, knox, in, scotland, during, the, first, english, civil, war, english, and, scots, presbyterians, produced, the, westminster, confession, which, became, the, confessional, standard, for, presbyterians, in, the, english, speaking, world, having, established, itself, in, europe, the, movement, continued, to, spread, to, areas, including, north, america, south, africa, and, korea, while, calvin, did, not, live, to, see, the, foundation, of, his, work, grow, into, an, international, movement, his, death, allowed, his, ideas, to, spread, far, beyond, their, city, of, origin, and, their, borders, and, to, establish, their, own, distinct, character, although, much, of, calvin, s, work, was, in, geneva, his, publications, spread, his, ideas, of, a, correctly, reformed, church, to, many, parts, of, europe, in, switzerland, some, cantons, are, still, reformed, and, some, are, catholic, calvinism, became, the, dominant, doctrine, within, the, church, of, scotland, the, dutch, republic, some, communities, in, flanders, and, parts, of, germany, especially, those, adjacent, to, the, netherlands, in, the, palatinate, kassel, and, lippe, spread, by, olevianus, and, zacharias, ursinus, among, others, protected, by, the, local, nobility, calvinism, became, a, significant, religion, in, eastern, hungary, and, hungarian, speaking, areas, of, transylvania, as, of, 2007, there, are, about, 3, 5, million, hungarian, reformed, people, worldwide, calvinism, was, influential, in, france, lithuania, and, poland, before, being, mostly, erased, during, the, counter, reformation, one, of, the, most, important, polish, reformed, theologists, was, john, a, lasco, who, was, also, involved, into, organising, churches, in, east, frisia, and, stranger, s, church, in, london, later, a, faction, called, the, polish, brethren, broke, away, from, calvinism, on, january, 22, 1556, when, piotr, of, goni, dz, a, polish, student, spoke, out, against, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, during, the, general, synod, of, the, reformed, churches, of, poland, held, in, the, village, of, secemin, calvinism, gained, some, popularity, in, scandinavia, especially, sweden, but, was, rejected, in, favor, of, lutheranism, after, the, synod, of, uppsala, in, 1593, many, 17th, century, european, settlers, in, the, thirteen, colonies, in, british, america, were, calvinists, who, emigrated, because, of, arguments, over, church, structure, including, the, pilgrim, fathers, others, were, forced, into, exile, including, the, french, huguenots, dutch, and, french, calvinist, settlers, were, also, among, the, first, european, colonizers, of, south, africa, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, who, became, known, as, boers, or, afrikaners, sierra, leone, was, largely, colonized, by, calvinist, settlers, from, nova, scotia, many, of, whom, were, black, loyalists, who, fought, for, the, british, empire, during, the, american, war, of, independence, john, marrant, had, organized, a, congregation, there, under, the, auspices, of, the, huntingdon, connection, some, of, the, largest, calvinist, communions, were, started, by, 19th, and, 20th, century, missionaries, especially, large, are, those, in, indonesia, korea, and, nigeria, in, south, korea, there, are, 20, 000, presbyterian, congregations, with, about, 9, 10, million, church, members, scattered, in, more, than, 100, presbyterian, denominations, in, south, korea, presbyterianism, is, the, largest, christian, denomination, a, 2011, report, of, the, pew, forum, on, religious, and, public, life, estimated, that, members, of, presbyterian, or, reformed, churches, make, up, 7, of, the, estimated, 801, million, protestants, globally, or, approximately, 56, million, people, though, the, broadly, defined, reformed, faith, is, much, larger, as, it, constitutes, congregationalist, 0, 5, most, of, the, united, and, uniting, churches, unions, of, different, denominations, 7, 2, and, most, likely, some, of, the, other, protestant, denominations, 38, 2, all, three, are, distinct, categories, from, presbyterian, or, reformed, 7, in, this, report, the, reformed, family, of, churches, is, one, of, the, largest, christian, denominations, according, to, adherents, com, the, reformed, presbyterian, congregational, united, churches, represent, 75, million, believers, worldwide, the, world, communion, of, reformed, churches, which, includes, some, united, churches, has, 80, million, believers, wcrc, is, the, third, largest, christian, communion, in, the, world, after, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, many, conservative, reformed, churches, which, are, strongly, calvinistic, formed, the, world, reformed, fellowship, which, has, about, 70, member, denominations, most, are, not, part, of, the, world, communion, of, reformed, churches, because, of, its, ecumenical, attire, the, international, conference, of, reformed, churches, is, another, conservative, association, church, of, tuvalu, is, an, officially, established, state, church, in, the, calvinist, tradition, reformed, theologians, believe, that, god, communicates, knowledge, of, himself, to, people, through, the, word, of, god, people, are, not, able, to, know, anything, about, god, except, through, this, self, revelation, with, the, exception, of, general, revelation, of, god, his, invisible, attributes, his, eternal, power, and, divine, nature, have, been, clearly, seen, being, understood, through, what, has, been, made, so, that, they, are, without, excuse, romans, 1, 20, speculation, about, anything, which, god, has, not, revealed, through, his, word, is, not, warranted, the, knowledge, people, have, of, god, is, different, from, that, which, they, have, of, anything, else, because, god, is, infinite, and, finite, people, are, incapable, of, comprehending, an, infinite, being, while, the, knowledge, revealed, by, god, to, people, is, never, incorrect, it, is, also, never, comprehensive, according, to, reformed, theologians, god, s, self, revelation, is, always, through, his, son, jesus, christ, because, christ, is, the, only, mediator, between, god, and, people, revelation, of, god, through, christ, comes, through, two, basic, channels, the, first, is, creation, and, providence, which, is, god, s, creating, and, continuing, to, work, in, the, world, this, action, of, god, gives, everyone, knowledge, about, god, but, this, knowledge, is, only, sufficient, to, make, people, culpable, for, their, sin, it, does, not, include, knowledge, of, the, gospel, the, second, channel, through, which, god, reveals, himself, is, redemption, which, is, the, gospel, of, salvation, from, condemnation, which, is, punishment, for, sin, in, reformed, theology, the, word, of, god, takes, several, forms, jesus, christ, himself, is, the, word, incarnate, the, prophecies, about, him, said, to, be, found, in, the, old, testament, and, the, ministry, of, the, apostles, who, saw, him, and, communicated, his, message, are, also, the, word, of, god, further, the, preaching, of, ministers, about, god, is, the, very, word, of, god, because, god, is, considered, to, be, speaking, through, them, god, also, speaks, through, human, writers, in, the, bible, which, is, composed, of, texts, set, apart, by, god, for, self, revelation, reformed, theologians, emphasize, the, bible, as, a, uniquely, important, means, by, which, god, communicates, with, people, people, gain, knowledge, of, god, from, the, bible, which, cannot, be, gained, in, any, other, way, reformed, theologians, affirm, that, the, bible, is, true, but, differences, emerge, among, them, over, the, meaning, and, extent, of, its, truthfulness, conservative, followers, of, the, princeton, theologians, take, the, view, that, the, bible, is, true, and, inerrant, or, incapable, of, error, or, falsehood, in, every, place, this, view, is, similar, to, that, of, catholic, orthodoxy, as, well, as, modern, evangelicalism, another, view, influenced, by, the, teaching, of, karl, barth, and, neo, orthodoxy, is, found, in, the, presbyterian, church, u, s, a, s, confession, of, 1967, those, who, take, this, view, believe, the, bible, to, be, the, primary, source, of, our, knowledge, of, god, but, also, that, some, parts, of, the, bible, may, be, false, not, witnesses, to, christ, and, not, normative, for, the, church, in, this, view, christ, is, the, revelation, of, god, and, the, scriptures, witness, to, this, revelation, rather, than, being, the, revelation, itself, reformed, theologians, use, the, concept, of, covenant, to, describe, the, way, god, enters, into, fellowship, with, people, in, history, the, concept, of, covenant, is, so, prominent, in, reformed, theology, that, reformed, theology, as, a, whole, is, sometimes, called, covenant, theology, however, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, century, theologians, developed, a, particular, theological, system, called, covenant, theology, or, federal, theology, which, many, conservative, reformed, churches, continue, to, affirm, this, framework, orders, god, s, life, with, people, primarily, in, two, covenants, the, covenant, of, works, and, the, covenant, of, grace, the, covenant, of, works, is, made, with, adam, and, eve, in, the, garden, of, eden, the, terms, of, the, covenant, are, that, god, provides, a, blessed, life, in, the, garden, on, condition, that, adam, and, eve, obey, god, s, law, perfectly, because, adam, and, eve, broke, the, covenant, by, eating, the, forbidden, fruit, they, became, subject, to, death, and, were, banished, from, the, garden, this, sin, was, passed, down, to, all, mankind, because, all, people, are, said, to, be, in, adam, as, a, covenantal, or, federal, head, federal, theologians, usually, imply, that, adam, and, eve, would, have, gained, immortality, had, they, obeyed, perfectly, a, second, covenant, called, the, covenant, of, grace, is, said, to, have, been, made, immediately, following, adam, and, eve, s, sin, in, it, god, graciously, offers, salvation, from, death, on, condition, of, faith, in, god, this, covenant, is, administered, in, different, ways, throughout, the, old, and, new, testaments, but, retains, the, substance, of, being, free, of, a, requirement, of, perfect, obedience, through, the, influence, of, karl, barth, many, contemporary, reformed, theologians, have, discarded, the, covenant, of, works, along, with, other, concepts, of, federal, theology, barth, saw, the, covenant, of, works, as, disconnected, from, christ, and, the, gospel, and, rejected, the, idea, that, god, works, with, people, in, this, way, instead, barth, argued, that, god, always, interacts, with, people, under, the, covenant, of, grace, and, that, the, covenant, of, grace, is, free, of, all, conditions, whatsoever, barth, s, theology, and, that, which, follows, him, has, been, called, mono, covenantal, as, opposed, to, the, bi, covenantal, scheme, of, classical, federal, theology, conservative, contemporary, reformed, theologians, such, as, john, murray, have, also, rejected, the, idea, of, covenants, based, on, law, rather, than, grace, michael, horton, however, has, defended, the, covenant, of, works, as, combining, principles, of, law, and, love, for, the, most, part, the, reformed, tradition, did, not, modify, the, medieval, consensus, on, the, doctrine, of, god, god, s, character, is, described, primarily, using, three, adjectives, eternal, infinite, and, unchangeable, reformed, theologians, such, as, shirley, guthrie, have, proposed, that, rather, than, conceiving, of, god, in, terms, of, his, attributes, and, freedom, to, do, as, he, pleases, the, doctrine, of, god, is, to, be, based, on, god, s, work, in, history, and, his, freedom, to, live, with, and, empower, people, reformed, theologians, have, also, traditionally, followed, the, medieval, tradition, going, back, to, before, the, early, church, councils, of, nicaea, and, chalcedon, on, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, god, is, affirmed, to, be, one, god, in, three, persons, father, son, and, holy, spirit, the, son, christ, is, held, to, be, eternally, begotten, by, the, father, and, the, holy, spirit, eternally, proceeding, from, the, father, and, son, however, contemporary, theologians, have, been, critical, of, aspects, of, western, views, here, as, well, drawing, on, the, eastern, tradition, these, reformed, theologians, have, proposed, a, social, trinitarianism, where, the, persons, of, the, trinity, only, exist, in, their, life, together, as, persons, in, relationship, contemporary, reformed, confessions, such, as, the, barmen, confession, and, brief, statement, of, faith, of, the, presbyterian, church, usa, have, avoided, language, about, the, attributes, of, god, and, have, emphasized, his, work, of, reconciliation, and, empowerment, of, people, feminist, theologian, letty, russell, used, the, image, of, partnership, for, the, persons, of, the, trinity, according, to, russell, thinking, this, way, encourages, christians, to, interact, in, terms, of, fellowship, rather, than, reciprocity, conservative, reformed, theologian, michael, horton, however, has, argued, that, social, trinitarianism, is, untenable, because, it, abandons, the, essential, unity, of, god, in, favor, of, a, community, of, separate, beings, reformed, theologians, affirm, the, historic, christian, belief, that, christ, is, eternally, one, person, with, a, divine, and, a, human, nature, reformed, christians, have, especially, emphasized, that, christ, truly, became, human, so, that, people, could, be, saved, christ, s, human, nature, has, been, a, point, of, contention, between, reformed, and, lutheran, christology, in, accord, with, the, belief, that, finite, humans, cannot, comprehend, infinite, divinity, reformed, theologians, hold, that, christ, s, human, body, cannot, be, in, multiple, locations, at, the, same, time, because, lutherans, believe, that, christ, is, bodily, present, in, the, eucharist, they, hold, that, christ, is, bodily, present, in, many, locations, simultaneously, for, reformed, christians, such, a, belief, denies, that, christ, actually, became, human, some, contemporary, reformed, theologians, have, moved, away, from, the, traditional, language, of, one, person, in, two, natures, viewing, it, as, unintelligible, to, contemporary, people, instead, theologians, tend, to, emphasize, jesus, s, context, and, particularity, as, a, first, century, jew, john, calvin, and, many, reformed, theologians, who, followed, him, describe, christ, s, work, of, redemption, in, terms, of, three, offices, prophet, priest, and, king, christ, is, said, to, be, a, prophet, in, that, he, teaches, perfect, doctrine, a, priest, in, that, he, intercedes, to, the, father, on, believers, behalf, and, offered, himself, as, a, sacrifice, for, sin, and, a, king, in, that, he, rules, the, church, and, fights, on, believers, behalf, the, threefold, office, links, the, work, of, christ, to, god, s, work, in, ancient, israel, many, but, not, all, reformed, theologians, continue, to, make, use, of, the, threefold, office, as, a, framework, because, of, its, emphasis, on, the, connection, of, christ, s, work, to, israel, they, have, however, often, reinterpreted, the, meaning, of, each, of, the, offices, for, example, karl, barth, interpreted, christ, s, prophetic, office, in, terms, of, political, engagement, on, behalf, of, the, poor, christians, believe, jesus, death, and, resurrection, make, it, possible, for, believers, to, receive, forgiveness, for, sin, and, reconciliation, with, god, through, the, atonement, reformed, protestants, generally, subscribe, to, a, particular, view, of, the, atonement, called, penal, substitutionary, atonement, which, explains, christ, s, death, as, a, sacrificial, payment, for, sin, christ, is, believed, to, have, died, in, place, of, the, believer, who, is, accounted, righteous, as, a, result, of, this, sacrificial, payment, in, christian, theology, people, are, created, good, and, in, the, image, of, god, but, have, become, corrupted, by, sin, which, causes, them, to, be, imperfect, and, overly, self, interested, reformed, christians, following, the, tradition, of, augustine, of, hippo, believe, that, this, corruption, of, human, nature, was, brought, on, by, adam, and, eve, s, first, sin, a, doctrine, called, original, sin, although, earlier, christian, authors, taught, the, elements, of, physical, death, moral, weakness, and, a, sin, propensity, within, original, sin, augustine, was, the, first, christian, to, add, the, concept, of, inherited, guilt, reatus, from, adam, whereby, every, infant, is, born, eternally, damned, and, humans, lack, any, residual, ability, to, respond, to, god, reformed, theologians, emphasize, that, this, sinfulness, affects, all, of, a, person, s, nature, including, their, will, this, view, that, sin, so, dominates, people, that, they, are, unable, to, avoid, sin, has, been, called, total, depravity, as, a, consequence, every, one, of, their, descendants, inherited, a, stain, of, corruption, and, depravity, this, condition, innate, to, all, humans, is, known, in, christian, theology, as, original, sin, calvin, thought, original, sin, was, a, hereditary, corruption, and, depravity, of, our, nature, extending, to, all, the, parts, of, the, soul, calvin, asserted, people, were, so, warped, by, original, sin, that, everything, which, our, mind, conceives, meditates, plans, and, resolves, is, always, evil, the, depraved, condition, of, every, human, being, is, not, the, result, of, sins, people, commit, during, their, lives, instead, before, we, are, born, while, we, are, in, our, mother, s, womb, we, are, in, god, s, sight, defiled, and, polluted, calvin, thought, people, were, justly, condemned, to, hell, because, their, corrupted, state, is, naturally, hateful, to, god, in, colloquial, english, the, term, total, depravity, can, be, easily, misunderstood, to, mean, that, people, are, absent, of, any, goodness, or, unable, to, do, any, good, however, the, reformed, teaching, is, actually, that, while, people, continue, to, bear, god, s, image, and, may, do, things, that, appear, outwardly, good, their, sinful, intentions, affect, all, of, their, nature, and, actions, so, that, they, are, not, pleasing, to, god, some, contemporary, theologians, in, the, reformed, tradition, such, as, those, associated, with, the, presbyterian, church, usa, s, confession, of, 1967, have, emphasized, the, social, character, of, human, sinfulness, these, theologians, have, sought, to, bring, attention, to, issues, of, environmental, economic, and, political, justice, as, areas, of, human, life, that, have, been, affected, by, sin, reformed, theologians, along, with, other, protestants, believe, salvation, from, punishment, for, sin, is, to, be, given, to, all, those, who, have, faith, in, christ, faith, is, not, purely, intellectual, but, involves, trust, in, god, s, promise, to, save, protestants, do, not, hold, there, to, be, any, other, requirement, for, salvation, but, that, faith, alone, is, sufficient, justification, is, the, part, of, salvation, where, god, pardons, the, sin, of, those, who, believe, in, christ, it, is, historically, held, by, protestants, to, be, the, most, important, article, of, christian, faith, though, more, recently, it, is, sometimes, given, less, importance, out, of, ecumenical, concerns, people, are, not, on, their, own, able, to, fully, repent, of, their, sin, or, prepare, themselves, to, repent, because, of, their, sinfulness, therefore, justification, is, held, to, arise, solely, from, god, s, free, and, gracious, act, sanctification, is, the, part, of, salvation, in, which, god, makes, believers, holy, by, enabling, them, to, exercise, greater, love, for, god, and, for, other, people, the, good, works, accomplished, by, believers, as, they, are, sanctified, are, considered, to, be, the, necessary, outworking, of, the, believer, s, salvation, though, they, do, not, cause, the, believer, to, be, saved, sanctification, like, justification, is, by, faith, because, doing, good, works, is, simply, living, as, the, child, of, god, one, has, become, reformed, theologians, teach, that, sin, so, affects, human, nature, that, they, are, unable, even, to, exercise, faith, in, christ, by, their, own, will, while, people, are, said, to, retain, free, will, in, that, they, willfully, sin, they, are, unable, not, to, sin, because, of, the, corruption, of, their, nature, due, to, original, sin, reformed, christians, believe, that, god, predestined, some, people, to, be, saved, and, others, were, predestined, to, eternal, damnation, this, choice, by, god, to, save, some, is, held, to, be, unconditional, and, not, based, on, any, characteristic, or, action, on, the, part, of, the, person, chosen, this, view, is, opposed, to, the, arminian, view, that, god, s, choice, of, whom, to, save, is, conditional, or, based, on, his, foreknowledge, of, who, would, respond, positively, to, god, karl, barth, reinterpreted, the, reformed, doctrine, of, predestination, to, apply, only, to, christ, individual, people, are, only, said, to, be, elected, through, their, being, in, christ, reformed, theologians, who, followed, barth, including, j, rgen, moltmann, david, migliore, and, shirley, guthrie, have, argued, that, the, traditional, reformed, concept, of, predestination, is, speculative, and, have, proposed, alternative, models, these, theologians, claim, that, a, properly, trinitarian, doctrine, emphasizes, god, s, freedom, to, love, all, people, rather, than, choosing, some, for, salvation, and, others, for, damnation, god, s, justice, towards, and, condemnation, of, sinful, people, is, spoken, of, by, these, theologians, as, out, of, his, love, for, them, and, a, desire, to, reconcile, them, to, himself, much, attention, surrounding, calvinism, focuses, on, the, five, points, of, calvinism, also, called, the, doctrines, of, grace, the, five, points, have, been, summarized, under, the, acrostic, tulip, the, five, points, are, popularly, said, to, summarize, the, canons, of, dort, however, there, is, no, historical, relationship, between, them, and, some, scholars, argue, that, their, language, distorts, the, meaning, of, the, canons, calvin, s, theology, and, the, theology, of, 17th, century, calvinistic, orthodoxy, particularly, in, the, language, of, total, depravity, and, limited, atonement, the, five, points, were, more, recently, popularized, in, the, 1963, booklet, the, five, points, of, calvinism, defined, defended, documented, by, david, n, steele, and, curtis, c, thomas, the, origins, of, the, five, points, and, the, acrostic, are, uncertain, but, they, appear, to, be, outlined, in, the, counter, remonstrance, of, 1611, a, lesser, known, reformed, reply, to, the, arminians, which, was, written, prior, to, the, canons, of, dort, the, acrostic, was, used, by, cleland, boyd, mcafee, as, early, as, circa, 1905, an, early, printed, appearance, of, the, acrostic, can, be, found, in, loraine, boettner, s, 1932, book, the, reformed, doctrine, of, predestination, reformed, christians, see, the, christian, church, as, the, community, with, which, god, has, made, the, covenant, of, grace, a, promise, of, eternal, life, and, relationship, with, god, this, covenant, extends, to, those, under, the, old, covenant, whom, god, chose, beginning, with, abraham, and, sarah, the, church, is, conceived, of, as, both, invisible, and, visible, the, invisible, church, is, the, body, of, all, believers, known, only, to, god, the, visible, church, is, the, institutional, body, which, contains, both, members, of, the, invisible, church, as, well, as, those, who, appear, to, have, faith, in, christ, but, are, not, truly, part, of, god, s, elect, in, order, to, identify, the, visible, church, reformed, theologians, have, spoken, of, certain, marks, of, the, church, for, some, the, only, mark, is, the, pure, preaching, of, the, gospel, of, christ, others, including, john, calvin, also, include, the, right, administration, of, the, sacraments, others, such, as, those, following, the, scots, confession, include, a, third, mark, of, rightly, administered, church, discipline, or, exercise, of, censure, against, unrepentant, sinners, these, marks, allowed, the, reformed, to, identify, the, church, based, on, its, conformity, to, the, bible, rather, than, the, magisterium, or, church, tradition, the, regulative, principle, of, worship, is, a, teaching, shared, by, some, calvinists, and, anabaptists, on, how, the, bible, orders, public, worship, the, substance, of, the, doctrine, regarding, worship, is, that, god, institutes, in, the, scriptures, everything, he, requires, for, worship, in, the, church, and, that, everything, else, is, prohibited, as, the, regulative, principle, is, reflected, in, calvin, s, own, thought, it, is, driven, by, his, evident, antipathy, toward, the, roman, catholic, church, and, its, worship, practices, and, it, associates, musical, instruments, with, icons, which, he, considered, violations, of, the, ten, commandments, prohibition, of, graven, images, on, this, basis, many, early, calvinists, also, eschewed, musical, instruments, and, advocated, a, cappella, exclusive, psalmody, in, worship, though, calvin, himself, allowed, other, scriptural, songs, as, well, as, psalms, and, this, practice, typified, presbyterian, worship, and, the, worship, of, other, reformed, churches, for, some, time, the, original, lord, s, day, service, designed, by, john, calvin, was, a, highly, liturgical, service, with, the, creed, alms, confession, and, absolution, the, lord, s, supper, doxologies, prayers, psalms, being, sung, the, lords, prayer, being, sung, and, benedictions, since, the, 19th, century, however, some, of, the, reformed, churches, have, modified, their, understanding, of, the, regulative, principle, and, make, use, of, musical, instruments, believing, that, calvin, and, his, early, followers, went, beyond, the, biblical, requirements, and, that, such, things, are, circumstances, of, worship, requiring, biblically, rooted, wisdom, rather, than, an, explicit, command, despite, the, protestations, of, those, who, hold, to, a, strict, view, of, the, regulative, principle, today, hymns, and, musical, instruments, are, in, common, use, as, are, contemporary, worship, music, styles, with, elements, such, as, worship, bands, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, limits, the, sacraments, to, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, sacraments, are, denoted, signs, and, seals, of, the, covenant, of, grace, westminster, speaks, of, a, sacramental, relation, or, a, sacramental, union, between, the, sign, and, the, thing, signified, whence, it, comes, to, pass, that, the, names, and, effects, of, the, one, are, attributed, to, the, other, baptism, is, for, infant, children, of, believers, as, well, as, believers, as, it, is, for, all, the, reformed, except, baptists, and, some, congregationalists, baptism, admits, the, baptized, into, the, visible, church, and, in, it, all, the, benefits, of, christ, are, offered, to, the, baptized, on, the, lord, s, supper, the, westminster, confession, takes, a, position, between, lutheran, sacramental, union, and, zwinglian, memorialism, the, lord, s, supper, really, and, indeed, yet, not, carnally, and, corporally, but, spiritually, receive, and, feed, upon, christ, crucified, and, all, benefits, of, his, death, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, being, then, not, corporally, or, carnally, in, with, or, under, the, bread, and, wine, yet, as, really, but, spiritually, present, to, the, faith, of, believers, in, that, ordinance, as, the, elements, themselves, are, to, their, outward, senses, the, 1689, london, baptist, confession, of, faith, does, not, use, the, term, sacrament, but, describes, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, as, ordinances, as, do, most, baptists, calvinist, or, otherwise, baptism, is, only, for, those, who, actually, profess, repentance, towards, god, and, not, for, the, children, of, believers, baptists, also, insist, on, immersion, or, dipping, in, contradistinction, to, other, reformed, christians, the, baptist, confession, describes, the, lord, s, supper, as, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, being, then, not, corporally, or, carnally, but, spiritually, present, to, the, faith, of, believers, in, that, ordinance, similarly, to, the, westminster, confession, there, is, significant, latitude, in, baptist, congregations, regarding, the, lord, s, supper, and, many, hold, the, zwinglian, view, there, are, two, schools, of, thought, regarding, the, logical, order, of, god, s, decree, to, ordain, the, fall, of, man, supralapsarianism, from, the, latin, supra, above, here, meaning, before, lapsus, fall, and, infralapsarianism, from, the, latin, infra, beneath, here, meaning, after, lapsus, fall, the, former, view, sometimes, called, high, calvinism, argues, that, the, fall, occurred, partly, to, facilitate, god, s, purpose, to, choose, some, individuals, for, salvation, and, some, for, damnation, infralapsarianism, sometimes, called, low, calvinism, is, the, position, that, while, the, fall, was, indeed, planned, it, was, not, planned, with, reference, to, who, would, be, saved, supralapsarianism, is, based, on, the, belief, that, god, chose, which, individuals, to, save, logically, prior, to, the, decision, to, allow, the, race, to, fall, and, that, the, fall, serves, as, the, means, of, realization, of, that, prior, decision, to, send, some, individuals, to, hell, and, others, to, heaven, that, is, it, provides, the, grounds, of, condemnation, in, the, reprobate, and, the, need, for, salvation, in, the, elect, in, contrast, infralapsarians, hold, that, god, planned, the, race, to, fall, logically, prior, to, the, decision, to, save, or, damn, any, individuals, because, it, is, argued, in, order, to, be, saved, one, must, first, need, to, be, saved, from, something, and, therefore, the, decree, of, the, fall, must, precede, predestination, to, salvation, or, damnation, these, two, views, vied, with, each, other, at, the, synod, of, dort, an, international, body, representing, calvinist, christian, churches, from, around, europe, and, the, judgments, that, came, out, of, that, council, sided, with, infralapsarianism, canons, of, dort,

articles, of, 1563, both, commit, the, church, of, england, to, the, fundamentals, of, the, reformed, faith, both, sets, of, articles, affirm, the, centrality, of, scripture, and, take, a, monergist, position, on, justification, both, sets, of, articles, affirm, that, the, church, of, england, accepts, the, doctrine, of, predestination, and, election, as, a, comfort, to, the, faithful, but, warn, against, over, much, speculation, concerning, that, doctrine, indeed, a, casual, reading, of, the, wurttemburg, confession, of, 1551, the, second, helvetic, confession, the, scots, confession, of, 1560, and, the, xxxix, articles, of, religion, reveal, them, to, be, cut, from, the, same, bolt, of, cloth, amyraldism, or, sometimes, amyraldianism, also, known, as, the, school, of, saumur, hypothetical, universalism, post, redemptionism, moderate, calvinism, or, four, point, calvinism, is, the, belief, that, god, prior, to, his, decree, of, election, decreed, christ, s, atonement, for, all, alike, if, they, believe, but, seeing, that, none, would, believe, on, their, own, he, then, elected, those, whom, he, will, bring, to, faith, in, christ, thereby, preserving, the, calvinist, doctrine, of, unconditional, election, the, efficacy, of, the, atonement, remains, limited, to, those, who, believe, named, after, its, formulator, moses, amyraut, this, doctrine, is, still, viewed, as, a, variety, of, calvinism, in, that, it, maintains, the, particularity, of, sovereign, grace, in, the, application, of, the, atonement, however, detractors, like, b, b, warfield, have, termed, it, an, inconsistent, and, therefore, unstable, form, of, calvinism, hyper, calvinism, first, referred, to, a, view, that, appeared, among, the, early, english, particular, baptists, in, the, 18th, century, their, system, denied, that, the, call, of, the, gospel, to, repent, and, believe, is, directed, to, every, single, person, and, that, it, is, the, duty, of, every, person, to, trust, in, christ, for, salvation, the, term, also, occasionally, appears, in, both, theological, and, secular, controversial, contexts, where, it, usually, connotes, a, negative, opinion, about, some, variety, of, theological, determinism, predestination, or, a, version, of, evangelical, christianity, or, calvinism, that, is, deemed, by, the, critic, to, be, unenlightened, harsh, or, extreme, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, says, that, the, gospel, is, to, be, freely, offered, to, sinners, and, the, larger, catechism, makes, clear, that, the, gospel, is, offered, to, the, non, elect,

identified, a, number, of, different, types, of, dutch, calvinism, the, seceders, split, into, the, reformed, church, west, and, the, confessionalists, and, the, neo, calvinists, the, positives, and, the, antithetical, calvinists, the, seceders, were, largely, infralapsarian, and, the, neo, calvinists, usually, supralapsarian, kuyper, wanted, to, awaken, the, church, from, what, he, viewed, as, its, pietistic, slumber, he, declared, no, single, piece, of, our, mental, world, is, to, be, sealed, off, from, the, rest, and, there, is, not, a, square, inch, in, the, whole, domain, of, human, existence, over, which, christ, who, is, sovereign, over, all, does, not, cry, mine, this, refrain, has, become, something, of, a, rallying, call, for, neo, calvinists, christian, reconstructionism, is, a, fundamentalist, calvinist, theonomic, movement, that, has, remained, rather, obscure, founded, by, r, j, rushdoony, the, movement, has, had, an, important, influence, on, the, christian, right, in, the, united, states, the, movement, peaked, in, the, 1990s, however, it, lives, on, in, small, denominations, such, as, the, reformed, presbyterian, church, in, the, united, states, and, as, a,

10, ideas, changing, the, world, some, of, the, major, figures, who, have, been, associated, with, the, new, calvinism, are, john, piper, mark, driscoll, al, mohler, mark, dever, c, j, mahaney, and, tim, keller, new, calvinists, have, been, criticized, for, blending, calvinist, soteriology, with, popular, evangelical, positions, on, the, sacraments, and, continuationism, and, for, rejecting, tenets, seen, as, crucial, to, the, reformed, faith, such, as, confessionalism, and, covenant, theology, calvin, expressed, himself, on, usury, in, a, 1545, letter, to, a, friend, claude, de, sachin, in, which, he, criticized, the, use, of, certain, passages, of, scripture, invoked, by, people, opposed, to, the, charging, of, interest, he, reinterpreted, some, of, these, passages, and, suggested, that, others, of, them, had, been, rendered, irrelevant, by, changed, conditions, he, also, dismissed, the, argument, based, upon, the, writings, of, aristotle, that, it, is, wrong, to, charge, interest, for, money, because, money, itself, is, barren, he, said, that, the, walls, and, the, roof, of, a, house, are, barren, too, but, it, is, permissible, to, charge, someone, for, allowing, him, to, use, them, in, the, same, way, money, can, be, made, fruitful, he, qualified, his, view, however, by, saying, that, money, should, be, lent, to, people, in, dire, need, without, hope, of, interest, while, a, modest, interest, rate, of, 5, should, be, permitted, in, relation, to, other, borrowers, in, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, max, weber, wrote, that, capitalism, in, northern, europe, evolved, when, the, protestant, particularly, calvinist, ethic, influenced, large, numbers, of, people, to, engage, in, work, in, the, secular, world, developing, their, own, enterprises, and, engaging, in, trade, and, the, accumulation, of, wealth, for, investment, in, other, words, the, protestant, work, ethic, was, an, important, force, behind, the,

to, political, absolutism, and, furthered, the, cause, of, democracy, the, congregationalists, who, founded, plymouth, colony, 1620, and, massachusetts, bay, colony, 1628, were, convinced, that, the,
