a, worldview, or, a, world, view, or, weltanschauung, is, the, fundamental, cognitive, orientation, of, an, individual, or, society, encompassing, the, whole, of, the, individual, s, or, society, s, knowledge, culture, and, point, of, view, a, worldview, can, include, natural, philosophy, fundamental, existential, and, normative, postulates, or, themes, values, emotions, and, ethics, the, term, worldview, is, a, calque, of, the, german, word, weltanschauung, composed, of, welt, world, and, anschauung, perception, or, view, the, german, word, is, also, used, in, english, it, is, a, concept, fundamental, to, german, philosophy, especially, epistemology, and, refers, to, a, wide, world, perception, additionally, it, refers, to, the, framework, of, ideas, and, beliefs, forming, a, global, description, through, which, an, individual, group, or, culture, watches, and, interprets, the, world, and, interacts, with, it, as, a, social, reality, within, cognitive, philosophy, and, the, cognitive, sciences, is, the, german, concept, of, weltanschauung, this, expression, is, used, to, refer, to, the, wide, worldview, or, wide, world, perception, of, a, people, family, or, person, the, weltanschauung, of, a, people, originates, from, the, unique, world, experience, of, a, people, which, they, experience, over, several, millennia, the, language, of, a, people, reflects, the, weltanschauung, of, that, people, in, the, form, of, its, syntactic, structures, and, untranslatable, connotations, and, its, denotations, the, term, weltanschauung, is, often, wrongly, attributed, to, wilhelm, von, humboldt, the, founder, of, german, ethnolinguistics, however, humboldt, s, key, concept, was, weltansicht, weltansicht, was, used, by, humboldt, to, refer, to, the, overarching, conceptual, and, sensorial, apprehension, of, reality, shared, by, a, linguistic, community, nation, on, the, other, hand, weltanschauung, first, used, by, immanuel, kant, and, later, popularized, by, hegel, was, always, used, in, german, and, later, in, english, to, refer, more, to, philosophies, ideologies, and, cultural, or, religious, perspectives, than, to, linguistic, communities, and, their, mode, of, apprehending, reality, in, 1911, the, german, philosopher, wilhelm, dilthey, published, an, essay, entitled, the, types, of, weltanschauung, and, their, development, in, metaphysics, that, became, quite, influential, dilthey, characterized, worldviews, as, providing, a, perspective, on, life, that, encompasses, the, cognitive, evaluative, and, volitional, aspects, of, human, experience, although, worldviews, have, always, been, expressed, in, literature, and, religion, philosophers, have, attempted, to, give, them, conceptual, definition, in, their, metaphysical, systems, on, that, basis, dilthey, found, it, possible, to, distinguish, three, general, recurring, types, of, worldview, the, first, of, these, he, called, naturalism, because, it, gives, priority, to, the, perceptual, and, experimental, determination, of, what, is, and, allows, contingency, to, influence, how, we, evaluate, and, respond, to, reality, naturalism, can, be, found, in, democritus, hobbes, hume, and, many, other, modern, philosophers, the, second, type, of, worldview, is, called, the, idealism, of, freedom, and, is, represented, by, plato, descartes, kant, and, bergson, among, others, it, is, dualistic, and, gives, primacy, to, the, freedom, of, the, will, the, organizational, order, of, our, world, is, structured, by, our, mind, and, the, will, to, know, the, third, type, is, called, objective, idealism, and, dilthey, sees, it, in, heraclitus, parmenides, spinoza, leibniz, and, hegel, in, objective, idealism, the, ideal, does, not, hover, above, what, is, actual, but, inheres, in, it, this, third, type, of, worldview, is, ultimately, monistic, and, seeks, to, discern, the, inner, coherence, and, harmony, among, all, things, dilthey, thought, it, impossible, to, come, up, with, a, universally, valid, metaphysical, or, systematic, formulation, of, any, of, these, worldviews, but, regarded, them, as, useful, schema, for, his, own, more, reflective, kind, of, life, philosophy, see, makkreel, and, rodi, wilhelm, dilthey, selected, works, volume, 6, 2019, anthropologically, worldviews, can, be, expressed, as, the, fundamental, cognitive, affective, and, evaluative, presuppositions, a, group, of, people, make, about, the, nature, of, things, and, which, they, use, to, order, their, lives, if, it, were, possible, to, draw, a, map, of, the, world, on, the, basis, of, weltanschauung, it, would, probably, be, seen, to, cross, political, borders, weltanschauung, is, the, product, of, political, borders, and, common, experiences, of, a, people, from, a, geographical, region, environmental, climatic, conditions, the, economic, resources, available, socio, cultural, systems, and, the, language, family, the, work, of, the, population, geneticist, luigi, luca, cavalli, sforza, aims, to, show, the, gene, linguistic, co, evolution, of, people, according, to, james, w, underhill, worldview, can, periodically, be, used, very, differently, by, certain, linguists, and, sociologists, it, is, for, this, reason, that, underhill, and, those, who, influenced, him, attempted, to, wed, metaphor, in, for, example, the, sociology, of, religion, with, discourse, analysis, underhill, also, proposed, five, subcategories, for, the, study, of, worldview, world, perceiving, world, conceiving, cultural, mindset, personal, world, and, perspective, one, can, think, of, a, worldview, as, comprising, a, number, of, basic, beliefs, which, are, philosophically, equivalent, to, the, axioms, of, the, worldview, considered, as, a, logical, or, consistent, theory, these, basic, beliefs, cannot, by, definition, be, proven, in, the, logical, sense, within, the, worldview, precisely, because, they, are, axioms, and, are, typically, argued, from, rather, than, argued, for, however, their, coherence, can, be, explored, philosophically, and, logically, if, two, different, worldviews, have, sufficient, common, beliefs, it, may, be, possible, to, have, a, constructive, dialogue, between, them, on, the, other, hand, if, different, worldviews, are, held, to, be, basically, incommensurate, and, irreconcilable, then, the, situation, is, one, of, cultural, relativism, and, would, therefore, incur, the, standard, criticisms, from, philosophical, realists, additionally, religious, believers, might, not, wish, to, see, their, beliefs, relativized, into, something, that, is, only, true, for, them, subjective, logic, is, a, belief, reasoning, formalism, where, beliefs, explicitly, are, subjectively, held, by, individuals, but, where, a, consensus, between, different, worldviews, can, be, achieved, a, third, alternative, sees, the, worldview, approach, as, only, a, methodological, relativism, as, a, suspension, of, judgment, about, the, truth, of, various, belief, systems, but, not, a, declaration, that, there, is, no, global, truth, for, instance, the, religious, philosopher, ninian, smart, begins, his, worldviews, cross, cultural, explorations, of, human, beliefs, with, exploring, religions, and, analysing, worldviews, and, argues, for, the, neutral, dispassionate, study, of, different, religious, and, secular, systems, a, process, i, call, worldview, analysis, the, comparison, of, religious, philosophical, or, scientific, worldviews, is, a, delicate, endeavor, because, such, worldviews, start, from, different, presuppositions, and, cognitive, values, cl, ment, vidal, has, proposed, metaphilosophical, criteria, for, the, comparison, of, worldviews, classifying, them, in, three, broad, categories, while, leo, apostel, and, his, followers, clearly, hold, that, individuals, can, construct, worldviews, other, writers, regard, worldviews, as, operating, at, a, community, level, or, in, an, unconscious, way, for, instance, if, one, s, worldview, is, fixed, by, one, s, language, as, according, to, a, strong, version, of, the, sapir, whorf, hypothesis, one, would, have, to, learn, or, invent, a, new, language, in, order, to, construct, a, new, worldview, according, to, apostel, a, worldview, is, an, ontology, or, a, descriptive, model, of, the, world, it, should, comprise, these, six, elements, a, worldview, according, to, terror, management, theory, tmt, serves, as, a, buffer, against, death, anxiety, it, is, theorized, that, living, up, to, the, ideals, of, one, s, worldview, provides, a, sense, of, self, esteem, which, provides, a, sense, of, transcending, the, limits, of, human, life, e, g, literally, as, in, religious, belief, in, immortality, symbolically, as, in, art, works, or, children, to, live, on, after, one, s, death, or, in, contributions, to, one, s, culture, evidence, in, support, of, terror, management, theory, includes, a, series, of, experiments, by, jeff, schimel, and, colleagues, in, which, a, group, of, canadians, found, to, score, highly, on, a, measure, of, patriotism, were, asked, to, read, an, essay, attacking, the, dominant, canadian, worldview, using, a, test, of, death, thought, accessibility, dta, involving, an, ambiguous, word, completion, test, e, g, coff, could, either, be, completed, as, either, coffee, or, coffin, or, coffer, participants, who, had, read, the, essay, attacking, their, worldview, were, found, to, have, a, significantly, higher, level, of, dta, than, the, control, group, who, read, a, similar, essay, attacking, australian, cultural, values, mood, was, also, measured, following, the, worldview, threat, to, test, whether, the, increase, in, death, thoughts, following, worldview, threat, were, due, to, other, causes, for, example, anger, at, the, attack, on, one, s, cultural, worldview, no, significant, changes, on, mood, scales, were, found, immediately, following, the, worldview, threat, to, test, the, generalisability, of, these, findings, to, groups, and, worldviews, other, than, those, of, nationalistic, canadians, schimel, et, al, conducted, a, similar, experiment, on, a, group, of, religious, individuals, whose, worldview, included, that, of, creationism, participants, were, asked, to, read, an, essay, which, argued, in, support, of, the, theory, of, evolution, following, which, the, same, measure, of, dta, was, taken, as, for, the, canadian, group, religious, participants, with, a, creationist, worldview, were, found, to, have, a, significantly, higher, level, of, death, thought, accessibility, than, those, of, the, control, group, goldenberg, et, al, found, that, highlighting, the, similarities, between, humans, and, other, animals, increases, death, thought, accessibility, as, does, attention, to, the, physical, rather, than, meaningful, qualities, of, sex, nishida, kitaro, wrote, extensively, on, the, religious, worldview, in, exploring, the, philosophical, significance, of, eastern, religions, according, to, neo, calvinist, david, naugle, s, world, view, the, history, of, a, concept, conceiving, of, christianity, as, a, worldview, has, been, one, of, the, most, significant, developments, in, the, recent, history, of, the, church, the, christian, thinker, james, w, sire, defines, a, worldview, as, a, commitment, a, fundamental, orientation, of, the, heart, that, can, be, expressed, as, a, story, or, in, a, set, of, presuppositions, assumptions, which, may, be, true, partially, true, or, entirely, false, which, we, hold, consciously, or, subconsciously, consistently, or, inconsistently, about, the, basic, construction, of, reality, and, that, provides, the, foundation, on, which, we, live, and, move, and, have, our, being, he, suggests, that, we, should, all, think, in, terms, of, worldviews, that, is, with, a, consciousness, not, only, of, our, own, way, of, thought, but, also, that, of, other, people, so, that, we, can, first, understand, and, then, genuinely, communicate, with, others, in, our, pluralistic, society, the, commitment, mentioned, by, james, w, sire, can, be, extended, further, the, worldview, increases, the, commitment, to, serve, the, world, with, the, change, of, a, person, s, view, towards, the, world, he, she, can, be, motivated, to, serve, the, world, this, serving, attitude, has, been, illustrated, by, tareq, m, zayed, as, the, emancipatory, worldview, in, his, writing, history, of, emancipatory, worldview, of, muslim, learners, david, bell, has, also, raised, questions, on, religious, worldviews, for, the, designers, of, superintelligences, machines, much, smarter, than, humans
