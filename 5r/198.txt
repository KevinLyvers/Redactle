the, hebrew, bible, or, tanakh, t, n, x, hebrew, tana, also, known, in, hebrew, as, miqra, m, i, k, r, hebrew, m, qr, is, the, canonical, collection, of, hebrew, scriptures, comprising, the, torah, the, nevi, im, and, the, ketuvim, different, branches, of, judaism, and, samaritanism, have, maintained, different, versions, of, the, canon, including, the, 3rd, century, bce, septuagint, text, used, in, second, temple, judaism, the, syriac, peshitta, the, samaritan, pentateuch, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, most, recently, the, 10th, century, medieval, masoretic, text, compiled, by, the, masoretes, currently, used, in, rabbinic, judaism, the, terms, hebrew, bible, or, hebrew, canon, are, frequently, confused, with, the, masoretic, text, however, this, is, a, medieval, version, and, one, of, several, texts, considered, authoritative, by, different, types, of, judaism, throughout, history, the, current, edition, of, the, masoretic, text, is, mostly, in, biblical, hebrew, with, a, few, passages, in, biblical, aramaic, in, the, books, of, daniel, and, ezra, and, the, verse, jeremiah, 10, 11, the, authoritative, form, of, the, modern, hebrew, bible, used, in, rabbinic, judaism, is, the, masoretic, text, 7th, to, 10th, century, ce, which, consists, of, 24, books, divided, into, chapters, and, pesuqim, verses, the, hebrew, bible, developed, during, the, second, temple, period, as, the, jews, decided, which, religious, texts, were, of, divine, origin, the, masoretic, text, compiled, by, the, jewish, scribes, and, scholars, of, the, early, middle, ages, comprises, the, hebrew, and, aramaic, 24, books, that, they, considered, authoritative, the, hellenized, greek, speaking, jews, of, alexandria, produced, a, greek, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, called, the, septuagint, that, included, books, later, identified, as, the, apocrypha, while, the, samaritans, produced, their, own, edition, of, the, torah, the, samaritan, pentateuch, according, to, the, dutch, israeli, biblical, scholar, and, linguist, emanuel, tov, professor, of, bible, studies, at, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, both, of, these, ancient, editions, of, the, hebrew, bible, differ, significantly, from, the, medieval, masoretic, text, in, addition, to, the, masoretic, text, modern, biblical, scholars, seeking, to, understand, the, history, of, the, hebrew, bible, use, a, range, of, sources, these, include, the, septuagint, the, syriac, language, peshitta, translation, the, samaritan, pentateuch, the, dead, sea, scrolls, collection, the, targum, onkelos, and, quotations, from, rabbinic, manuscripts, these, sources, may, be, older, than, the, masoretic, text, in, some, cases, and, often, differ, from, it, these, differences, have, given, rise, to, the, theory, that, yet, another, text, an, urtext, of, the, hebrew, bible, once, existed, and, is, the, source, of, the, versions, extant, today, however, such, an, urtext, has, never, been, found, and, which, of, the, three, commonly, known, versions, septuagint, masoretic, text, samaritan, pentateuch, is, closest, to, the, urtext, is, debated, there, are, many, similarities, between, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, christian, old, testament, the, protestant, old, testament, has, the, same, books, as, the, hebrew, bible, but, the, books, are, arranged, in, different, orders, the, roman, catholic, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, include, the, deuterocanonical, books, which, are, not, included, in, the, hebrew, bible, in, islam, the, tawrat, arabic, is, identified, not, only, with, the, pentateuch, the, five, books, of, moses, but, also, with, the, other, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, tanakh, is, an, acronym, made, from, the, first, hebrew, letter, of, each, of, the, masoretic, text, s, three, traditional, divisions, torah, literally, instruction, or, law, nevi, im, prophets, and, ketuvim, writings, hence, tanakh, the, three, part, division, reflected, in, the, acronym, tanakh, is, well, attested, in, the, rabbinic, literature, during, that, period, however, tanakh, was, not, used, instead, the, proper, title, was, mikra, or, miqra, meaning, reading, or, that, which, is, read, because, the, biblical, texts, were, read, publicly, the, acronym, tanakh, is, first, recorded, in, the, medieval, era, mikra, continues, to, be, used, in, hebrew, to, this, day, alongside, tanakh, to, refer, to, the, hebrew, scriptures, in, modern, spoken, hebrew, they, are, interchangeable, many, biblical, studies, scholars, advocate, use, of, the, term, hebrew, bible, or, hebrew, scriptures, as, a, substitute, for, less, neutral, terms, with, jewish, or, christian, connotations, e, g, tanakh, or, old, testament, the, society, of, biblical, literature, s, handbook, of, style, which, is, the, standard, for, major, academic, journals, like, the, harvard, theological, review, and, conservative, protestant, journals, like, the, bibliotheca, sacra, and, the, westminster, theological, journal, suggests, that, authors, be, aware, of, the, connotations, of, alternative, expressions, such, as, hebrew, bible, old, testament, without, prescribing, the, use, of, either, hebrew, refers, to, the, original, language, of, the, books, but, it, may, also, be, taken, as, referring, to, the, jews, of, the, second, temple, era, and, their, descendants, who, preserved, the, transmission, of, the, masoretic, text, up, to, the, present, day, the, hebrew, bible, includes, small, portions, in, aramaic, mostly, in, the, books, of, daniel, and, ezra, written, and, printed, in, aramaic, square, script, which, was, adopted, as, the, hebrew, alphabet, after, the, babylonian, exile, the, tanakh, includes, a, variety, of, genres, including, narratives, of, events, set, in, the, past, the, torah, genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, and, deuteronomy, contains, legal, material, the, book, of, psalms, is, a, collection, of, hymns, but, songs, are, included, elsewhere, in, the, tanakh, such, as, exodus, 15, 1, samuel, 2, and, jonah, 2, books, such, as, proverbs, and, ecclesiastes, are, examples, of, wisdom, literature, other, books, are, examples, of, prophecy, in, the, prophetic, books, a, prophet, denounces, evil, or, predicts, what, god, will, do, in, the, future, a, prophet, might, also, describe, and, interpret, visions, the, book, of, daniel, is, the, only, book, in, the, tanakh, usually, described, as, apocalyptic, literature, however, other, books, or, parts, of, books, have, been, called, proto, apocalyptic, such, as, isaiah, 24, 27, joel, and, zechariah, 9, 14, a, central, theme, throughout, the, tanakh, is, monotheism, worshiping, one, god, the, tanakh, was, created, by, the, israelites, a, people, who, lived, within, the, cultural, and, religious, context, of, the, ancient, near, east, the, religions, of, the, ancient, near, east, were, polytheistic, but, the, israelites, rejected, polytheism, in, favor, of, monotheism, biblical, scholar, christine, hayes, writes, that, the, hebrew, bible, was, the, record, of, religious, and, cultural, revolution, according, to, biblical, scholar, john, barton, yhwh, is, consistently, presented, throughout, the, as, the, god, who, created, the, world, and, as, the, only, god, with, whom, israel, is, to, be, concerned, this, special, relationship, between, god, and, israel, is, described, in, terms, of, covenant, as, part, of, the, covenant, god, gives, his, people, the, promised, land, as, an, eternal, possession, the, god, of, the, covenant, is, also, a, god, of, redemption, god, liberates, his, people, from, egypt, and, continually, intervenes, to, save, them, from, their, enemies, the, tanakh, imposes, ethical, requirements, including, social, justice, and, ritual, purity, see, tumah, and, taharah, the, tanakh, forbids, the, exploitation, of, widows, orphans, and, other, vulnerable, groups, in, addition, the, tanakh, condemns, murder, theft, bribery, corruption, deceitful, trading, adultery, incest, bestiality, and, homosexual, acts, another, theme, of, the, tanakh, is, theodicy, showing, that, god, is, just, even, though, evil, and, suffering, are, present, in, the, world, the, tanakh, begins, with, the, genesis, creation, narrative, genesis, 12, 50, traces, israelite, origins, to, the, patriarchs, abraham, his, son, isaac, and, grandson, jacob, god, promises, abraham, and, his, descendants, blessing, and, land, the, covenant, god, makes, with, abraham, is, signified, by, male, circumcision, the, children, of, jacob, become, the,

law, of, moses, to, guide, their, behavior, the, law, includes, rules, for, both, religious, ritual, and, ethics, see, ethics, in, the, bible, this, moral, code, requires, justice, and, care, for, the, poor, widows, and, orphans, the, biblical, story, affirms, god, s, unconditional, love, for, his, people, but, he, still, punishes, them, when, they, fail, to, live, by, the, covenant, god, leads, israel, into, the, promised, land, of, canaan, which, they, conquer, after, five, years, for, the, next, 470, years, the, israelites, were, led, by, judges, in, time, a, new, enemy, emerged, called, the, philistines, they, continued, to, trouble, israel, when, the, prophet, samuel, was, judge, 1, samuel, 4, 1, 7, 1, when, samuel, grew, old, the, people, requested, that, he, choose, a, king, because, samuel, s, sons, were, corrupt, and, they, wanted, to, be, like, other, nations, 1, samuel, 8, the, tanakh, presents, this, negatively, as, a, rejection, of, god, s, kingship, nevertheless, god, permits, it, and, saul, of, the, tribe, of, benjamin, is, anointed, king, this, inaugurates, the, united, monarchy, of, the, kingdom, of, israel, an, officer, in, saul, s, army,

location, between, judah, in, the, southern, hills, and, the, northern, israelite, tribes, made, it, an, ideal, location, from, which, to, rule, over, all, the, tribes, he, further, increased, jerusalem, s, importance, by, bringing, the, ark, of, the, covenant, there, from, shiloh, 2, samuel, 6, david, s, son, solomon, built, the, first, temple, in, jerusalem, after, solomon, s, death, the, united, kingdom, split, into, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, also, known, as, the, kingdom, of, samaria, with, its, capital, at, samaria, and, the, southern, kingdom, of, judah, with, its, capital, at, jerusalem, the, kingdom, of, samaria, survived, for, 200, years, until, it, was, conquered, by, the, assyrians, in, 722, bce, the, kingdom, of, judah, survived, for, longer, but, it, was, conquered, by, the, babylonians, in, 586, bce, the, temple, was, destroyed, and, many, judeans, were, exiled, to, babylon, in, 539, bce, babylon, was, conquered, by, cyrus, the, great, of, persia, who, allowed, the, exiles, to, return, to, judah, between, 520, and, 515, bce, the, temple, was, rebuilt, see, second, temple, religious, tradition, ascribes, authorship, of, the, torah, to, moses, in, later, biblical, texts, such, as, daniel, 9, 11, and, ezra, 3, 2, it, is, referred, to, as, the, torah, law, of, moses, however, the, torah, itself, only, credits, moses, with, writing, certain, sections, according, to, scholars, moses, would, have, lived, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, but, this, was, before, the, development, of, hebrew, writing, the, torah, is, dated, to, the, 1st, millennium, bce, after, israel, and, judah, had, already, developed, as, states, nevertheless, it, is, highly, likely, that, extensive, oral, transmission, of, proverbs, stories, and, songs, took, place, during, this, period, and, these, may, have, been, included, in, the, hebrew, bible, elements, of, genesis, 12, 50, which, describes, the, patriarchal, age, and, the, book, of, exodus, may, reflect, oral, traditions, in, these, stories, israelite, ancestors, such, as, jacob, or, moses, use, trickery, and, deception, to, survive, and, thrive, king, david, c, 1000, bce, is, credited, as, the, author, of, at, least, 73, psalms, his, son, solomon, is, identified, as, the, author, of, proverbs, ecclesiastes, and, song, of, solomon, the, tanakh, describes, their, reigns, as, a, golden, age, when, israel, flourished, both, culturally, and, militarily, however, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, and, it, is, most, likely, a, retrospective, extrapolation, of, conditions, under, king, jeroboam, ii, r, 781, 742, modern, scholars, believe, that, the, ancient, israelites, mostly, originated, from, within, canaan, their, material, culture, was, closely, related, to, their, canaanite, neighbors, and, hebrew, was, a, canaanite, dialect, archaeological, evidence, indicates, israel, began, as, loosely, organized, tribal, villages, in, the, hill, country, of, modern, day, israel, c, 1250, c, 1000, bce, during, crises, these, tribes, formed, temporary, alliances, the, book, of, judges, written, c, 600, bce, around, 500, years, after, the, events, it, describes, portrays, israel, as, a, grouping, of, decentralized, tribes, and, the, song, of, deborah, in, judges, 5, may, reflect, older, oral, traditions, it, features, archaic, elements, of, hebrew, and, a, tribal, list, that, identifies, israel, exclusively, with, the, northern, tribes, by, the, 9th, or, 8th, centuries, bce, the, scribal, culture, of, samaria, and, judah, was, sufficiently, developed, enough, to, produce, biblical, texts, the, kingdom, of, samaria, was, more, powerful, and, culturally, advanced, than, the, kingdom, of, judah, it, also, featured, multiple, cultic, sites, including, the, sanctuaries, at, bethel, and, dan, scholars, estimate, the, jacob, tradition, genesis, 25, 35, was, first, written, down, in, the, 8th, century, bce, and, probably, originated, in, the, north, because, the, stories, take, place, there, based, on, the, prominence, given, to, the, sanctuary, at, bethel, genesis, 28, these, stories, were, likely, preserved, and, written, down, at, that, religious, center, this, means, the, jacob, cycle, must, be, older, than, the, time, of, king, josiah, of, judah, r, 640, 609, bce, who, pushed, for, the, centralization, of, worship, at, jerusalem, the, story, of, moses, and, the, exodus, appears, to, also, originate, in, the, north, it, existed, as, a, self, contained, story, in, its, oral, and, earliest, written, forms, but, it, was, connected, to, the, patriarchal, stories, during, the, exile, or, post, exile, periods, the, account, of, moses, birth, exodus, 2, shows, similarities, to, the, birth, of, sargon, of, akkad, which, suggests, neo, assyrian, influence, sometime, after, 722, bce, while, the, moses, story, is, set, in, egypt, it, is, used, to, tell, both, an, anti, assyrian, and, anti, imperial, message, all, while, appropriating, assyrian, story, patterns, david, m, carr, notes, the, possibility, of, an, early, oral, tradition, for, the, exodus, story, to, be, sure, there, may, have, been, a, moses, group, themselves, of, canaanite, extraction, who, experienced, slavery, and, liberation, from, egypt, but, most, scholars, believe, that, such, a, group, if, it, existed, was, only, a, small, minority, in, early, israel, even, though, their, story, came, to, be, claimed, by, all, scholars, believe, psalm, 45, could, have, northern, origins, since, it, refers, to, a, king, marrying, a, foreign, princess, a, policy, of, the, omrides, some, psalms, may, have, originated, from, the, shrine, in, the, northern, city, of, dan, these, are, the, sons, of, korah, psalms, psalm, 29, and, psalm, 68, the, city, of, dan, probably, became, an, israelite, city, during, the, reign, of, king, jeroboam, ii, 781, 742, bce, before, then, it, belonged, to, aram, and, psalm, 20, is, nearly, identical, to, an, aramaic, psalm, found, in, the, 4th, century, bce, papyrus, amherst, 63, the, author, of, the, books, of, kings, likely, lived, in, jerusalem, the, text, shows, a, clear, bias, in, favor, of, judah, where, worship, of, god, was, centralized, at, jerusalem, the, kingdon, of, samaria, is, portrayed, as, a, godless, breakaway, region, whose, rulers, refuse, to, worship, at, jerusalem, the, books, that, make, up, the, hebrew, bible, were, composed, and, edited, in, stages, over, several, hundred, years, according, to, biblical, scholar, john, j, collins, it, now, seems, clear, that, all, the, hebrew, bible, received, its, final, shape, in, the, postexilic, or, second, temple, period, traditionally, moses, was, considered, the, author, of, the, torah, and, this, part, of, the, tanakh, achieved, authoritative, or, canonical, status, first, possibly, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, bce, this, is, suggested, by, ezra, 7, 6, which, describes, ezra, as, a, scribe, skilled, in, the, law, torah, of, moses, that, the, lord, the, god, of, israel, had, given, the, nevi, im, had, gained, canonical, status, by, the, 2nd, century, bce, there, are, references, to, the, law, and, the, prophets, in, the, book, of, sirach, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, the, new, testament, the, book, of, daniel, written, c, 164, bce, was, not, grouped, with, the, prophets, presumably, because, the, nevi, im, collection, was, already, fixed, by, this, time, the, ketuvim, was, the, last, part, of, the, tanakh, to, achieve, canonical, status, the, prologue, to, the, book, of, sirach, mentions, other, writings, along, with, the, law, and, prophets, but, does, not, specify, content, the, gospel, of, luke, refers, to, the, law, of, moses, the, prophets, and, the, psalms, luke, 24, 44, these, references, suggest, that, the, content, of, the, writings, remained, fluid, until, the, canonization, process, was, completed, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, as, to, when, the, hebrew, bible, canon, was, fixed, some, scholars, argue, that, it, was, fixed, by, the, hasmonean, dynasty, while, others, argue, it, was, not, fixed, until, the, second, century, ce, or, even, later, the, late, 1st, century, council, of, jamnia, was, once, credited, with, fixing, the, hebrew, canon, but, modern, scholars, believe, there, was, no, such, authoritative, council, of, rabbis, between, 70, and, 100, ce, rabbis, debated, whether, certain, books, make, the, hands, unclean, meaning, the, books, are, holy, and, should, be, considered, scripture, and, references, to, fixed, numbers, of, canonical, books, appear, there, were, several, criteria, for, inclusion, books, had, to, be, older, than, the, 4th, century, bce, or, attributed, to, an, author, who, had, lived, before, that, period, the, original, language, had, to, be, hebrew, and, books, needed, to, be, in, wide, use, many, books, considered, scripture, by, certain, jewish, communities, were, excluded, during, this, time, there, are, various, textual, variants, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, result, of, centuries, of, hand, copying, scribes, introduced, thousands, of, minor, changes, into, the, biblical, texts, sometimes, these, changes, were, by, accident, at, other, times, scribes, intentionally, added, clarifications, or, theological, material, in, the, middle, ages, jewish, scribes, produced, the, masoretic, text, which, became, the, authoritative, version, of, the, tanakh, ancient, hebrew, was, written, without, vowels, but, the, masoretes, added, vowel, markings, to, the, text, to, ensure, accuracy, rabbi, and, talmudic, scholar, louis, ginzberg, wrote, in, legends, of, the, jews, published, in, 1909, that, the, twenty, four, book, canon, was, fixed, by, ezra, and, the, scribes, in, the, second, temple, period, according, to, the, talmud, much, of, the, tanakh, was, compiled, by, the, men, of, the, great, assembly, anshei, k, nesset, hagedolah, a, task, completed, in, 450, bce, and, it, has, remained, unchanged, ever, since, the, 24, book, canon, is, mentioned, in, the, midrash, koheleth, 12, 12, whoever, brings, together, in, his, house, more, than, twenty, four, books, brings, confusion, the, original, writing, system, of, the, hebrew, text, was, an, abjad, consonants, written, with, some, applied, vowel, letters, matres, lectionis, during, the, early, middle, ages, scholars, known, as, the, masoretes, created, a, single, formalized, system, of, vocalization, this, was, chiefly, done, by, aaron, ben, moses, ben, asher, in, the, tiberias, school, based, on, the, oral, tradition, for, reading, the, tanakh, hence, the, name, tiberian, vocalization, it, also, included, some, innovations, of, ben, naftali, and, the, babylonian, exiles, despite, the, comparatively, late, process, of, codification, some, traditional, sources, and, some, orthodox, jews, hold, the, pronunciation, and, cantillation, to, derive, from, the, revelation, at, sinai, since, it, is, impossible, to, read, the, original, text, without, pronunciations, and, cantillation, pauses, the, combination, of, a, text, mikra, pronunciation, niqqud, and, cantillation, te, amim, enable, the, reader, to, understand, both, the, simple, meaning, and, the, nuances, in, sentence, flow, of, the, text, the, number, of, distinct, words, in, the, hebrew, bible, is, 8, 679, of, which, 1, 480, are, hapax, legomena, 112, words, or, expressions, that, occur, only, once, the, number, of, distinct, semitic, roots, on, which, many, of, these, biblical, words, are, based, is, roughly, 2000, 112, the, tanakh, consists, of, twenty, four, books, counting, as, one, book, each, 1, samuel, and, 2, samuel, 1, kings, and, 2, kings, 1, chronicles, and, 2, chronicles, and, ezra, nehemiah, the, twelve, minor, prophets, are, also, counted, as, a, single, book, in, hebrew, the, books, are, often, referred, to, by, their, prominent, first, words, the, torah, literally, teaching, is, also, known, as, the, pentateuch, or, as, the, five, books, of, moses, printed, versions, rather, than, scrolls, of, the, torah, are, often, called, chamisha, chumshei, torah, five, fifth, sections, of, the, torah, and, informally, as, chumash, nevi, im, n, m, prophets, is, the, second, main, division, of, the, tanakh, between, the, torah, and, ketuvim, this, division, includes, the, books, which, cover, the, time, from, the, entrance, of, the, israelites, into, the, land, of, israel, until, the, babylonian, captivity, of, judah, the, period, of, prophecy, their, distribution, is, not, chronological, but, substantive, the, former, prophets, nevi, im, rishonim, the, latter, prophets, nevi, im, aharonim, the, twelve, minor, prophets, trei, asar, the, twelve, which, are, considered, one, book, k, m, writings, consists, of, eleven, books, in, masoretic, manuscripts, and, some, printed, editions, psalms, proverbs, and, job, are, presented, in, a, special, two, column, form, emphasizing, the, parallel, stichs, in, the, verses, which, are, a, function, of, their, poetry, collectively, these, three, books, are, known, as, sifrei, emet, an, acronym, of, the, titles, in, hebrew, yields, emet, which, is, also, the, hebrew, for, truth, these, three, books, are, also, the, only, ones, in, tanakh, with, a, special, system, of, cantillation, notes, that, are, designed, to, emphasize, parallel, stichs, within, verses, however, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, book, of, job, are, in, the, normal, prose, system, the, five, relatively, short, books, of, the, song, of, songs, ruth, lamentations, ecclesiastes, and, esther, are, collectively, known, as, the, amesh, megillot, five, megillot, in, many, jewish, communities, these, books, are, read, aloud, in, the,
