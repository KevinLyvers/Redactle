in, philosophy, more, specifically, in, its, sub, fields, semantics, semiotics, philosophy, of, language, metaphysics, and, metasemantics, meaning, is, a, relationship, between, two, sorts, of, things, signs, and, the, kinds, of, things, they, intend, express, or, signify, the, types, of, meanings, vary, according, to, the, types, of, the, thing, that, is, being, represented, there, are, the, major, contemporary, positions, of, meaning, come, under, the, following, partial, definitions, of, meaning, the, question, of, what, is, a, proper, basis, for, deciding, how, words, symbols, ideas, and, beliefs, may, properly, be, considered, to, truthfully, denote, meaning, whether, by, a, single, person, or, by, an, entire, society, has, been, considered, by, five, major, types, of, theory, of, meaning, and, truth, each, type, is, discussed, below, together, with, its, principal, exponents, correspondence, theories, emphasise, that, true, beliefs, and, true, statements, of, meaning, correspond, to, the, actual, state, of, affairs, and, that, associated, meanings, must, be, in, agreement, with, these, beliefs, and, statements, this, type, of, theory, stresses, a, relationship, between, thoughts, or, statements, on, one, hand, and, things, or, objects, on, the, other, it, is, a, traditional, model, tracing, its, origins, to, ancient, greek, philosophers, such, as, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, this, class, of, theories, holds, that, the, truth, or, the, falsity, of, a, representation, is, determined, in, principle, entirely, by, how, it, relates, to, things, by, whether, it, accurately, describes, those, things, an, example, of, correspondence, theory, is, the, statement, by, the, thirteenth, century, philosopher, theologian, thomas, aquinas, veritas, est, adaequatio, rei, et, intellectus, truth, is, the, equation, of, things, and, intellect, a, statement, which, aquinas, attributed, to, the, ninth, century, neoplatonist, isaac, israeli, aquinas, also, restated, the, theory, as, a, judgment, is, said, to, be, true, when, it, conforms, to, the, external, reality, correspondence, theory, centres, heavily, around, the, assumption, that, truth, and, meaning, are, a, matter, of, accurately, copying, what, is, known, as, objective, reality, and, then, representing, it, in, thoughts, words, and, other, symbols, many, modern, theorists, have, stated, that, this, ideal, cannot, be, achieved, without, analysing, additional, factors, for, example, language, plays, a, role, in, that, all, languages, have, words, to, represent, concepts, that, are, virtually, undefined, in, other, languages, the, german, word, zeitgeist, is, one, such, example, one, who, speaks, or, understands, the, language, may, know, what, it, means, but, any, translation, of, the, word, apparently, fails, to, accurately, capture, its, full, meaning, this, is, a, problem, with, many, abstract, words, especially, those, derived, in, agglutinative, languages, thus, some, words, add, an, additional, parameter, to, the, construction, of, an, accurate, truth, predicate, among, the, philosophers, who, grappled, with, this, problem, is, alfred, tarski, whose, semantic, theory, is, summarized, further, below, in, this, article, for, coherence, theories, in, general, the, assessment, of, meaning, and, truth, requires, a, proper, fit, of, elements, within, a, whole, system, very, often, though, coherence, is, taken, to, imply, something, more, than, simple, logical, consistency, often, there, is, a, demand, that, the, propositions, in, a, coherent, system, lend, mutual, inferential, support, to, each, other, so, for, example, the, completeness, and, comprehensiveness, of, the, underlying, set, of, concepts, is, a, critical, factor, in, judging, the, validity, and, usefulness, of, a, coherent, system, a, pervasive, tenet, of, coherence, theories, is, the, idea, that, truth, is, primarily, a, property, of, whole, systems, of, propositions, and, can, be, ascribed, to, individual, propositions, only, according, to, their, coherence, with, the, whole, among, the, assortment, of, perspectives, commonly, regarded, as, coherence, theory, theorists, differ, on, the, question, of, whether, coherence, entails, many, possible, true, systems, of, thought, or, only, a, single, absolute, system, some, variants, of, coherence, theory, are, claimed, to, describe, the, essential, and, intrinsic, properties, of, formal, systems, in, logic, and, mathematics, however, formal, reasoners, are, content, to, contemplate, axiomatically, independent, and, sometimes, mutually, contradictory, systems, side, by, side, for, example, the, various, alternative, geometries, on, the, whole, coherence, theories, have, been, rejected, for, lacking, justification, in, their, application, to, other, areas, of, truth, especially, with, respect, to, assertions, about, the, natural, world, empirical, data, in, general, assertions, about, practical, matters, of, psychology, and, society, particularly, when, used, without, support, from, the, other, major, theories, of, truth, coherence, theories, distinguish, the, thought, of, rationalist, philosophers, particularly, of, spinoza, leibniz, and, g, w, f, hegel, along, with, the, british, philosopher, f, h, bradley, other, alternatives, may, be, found, among, several, proponents, of, logical, positivism, notably, otto, neurath, and, carl, hempel, social, constructivism, holds, that, meaning, and, truth, are, constructed, by, social, processes, are, historically, and, culturally, specific, and, are, in, part, shaped, through, power, struggles, within, a, community, constructivism, views, all, of, our, knowledge, as, constructed, because, it, does, not, reflect, any, external, transcendent, realities, as, a, pure, correspondence, theory, might, hold, rather, perceptions, of, truth, are, viewed, as, contingent, on, convention, human, perception, and, social, experience, it, is, believed, by, constructivists, that, representations, of, physical, and, biological, reality, including, race, sexuality, and, gender, are, socially, constructed, giambattista, vico, was, among, the, first, to, claim, that, history, and, culture, along, with, their, meaning, are, human, products, vico, s, epistemological, orientation, gathers, the, most, diverse, rays, and, unfolds, in, one, axiom, verum, ipsum, factum, truth, itself, is, constructed, hegel, and, marx, were, among, the, other, early, proponents, of, the, premise, that, truth, is, or, can, be, socially, constructed, marx, like, many, critical, theorists, who, followed, did, not, reject, the, existence, of, objective, truth, but, rather, distinguished, between, true, knowledge, and, knowledge, that, has, been, distorted, through, power, or, ideology, for, marx, scientific, and, true, knowledge, is, in, accordance, with, the, dialectical, understanding, of, history, and, ideological, knowledge, is, an, epiphenomenal, expression, of, the, relation, of, material, forces, in, a, given, economic, arrangement, consensus, theory, holds, that, meaning, and, truth, are, whatever, is, agreed, upon, or, in, some, versions, might, come, to, be, agreed, upon, by, some, specified, group, such, a, group, might, include, all, human, beings, or, a, subset, thereof, consisting, of, more, than, one, person, among, the, current, advocates, of, consensus, theory, as, a, useful, accounting, of, the, concept, of, truth, is, the, philosopher, j, rgen, habermas, habermas, maintains, that, truth, is, what, would, be, agreed, upon, in, an, ideal, speech, situation, among, the, recent, strong, critics, of, consensus, theory, has, been, the, philosopher, nicholas, rescher, the, three, most, influential, forms, of, the, pragmatic, theory, of, truth, and, meaning, were, introduced, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, by, charles, sanders, peirce, william, james, and, john, dewey, although, there, are, wide, differences, in, viewpoint, among, these, and, other, proponents, of, pragmatic, theory, they, hold, in, common, that, meaning, and, truth, are, verified, and, confirmed, by, the, results, of, putting, one, s, concepts, into, practice, peirce, defines, truth, as, follows, truth, is, that, concordance, of, an, abstract, statement, with, the, ideal, limit, towards, which, endless, investigation, would, tend, to, bring, scientific, belief, which, concordance, the, abstract, statement, may, possess, by, virtue, of, the, confession, of, its, inaccuracy, and, one, sidedness, and, this, confession, is, an, essential, ingredient, of, truth, this, statement, stresses, peirce, s, view, that, ideas, of, approximation, incompleteness, and, partiality, what, he, describes, elsewhere, as, fallibilism, and, reference, to, the, future, are, essential, to, a, proper, conception, of, meaning, and, truth, although, peirce, uses, words, like, concordance, and, correspondence, to, describe, one, aspect, of, the, pragmatic, sign, relation, he, is, also, quite, explicit, in, saying, that, definitions, of, truth, based, on, mere, correspondence, are, no, more, than, nominal, definitions, which, he, accords, a, lower, status, than, real, definitions, william, james, s, version, of, pragmatic, theory, while, complex, is, often, summarized, by, his, statement, that, the, true, is, only, the, expedient, in, our, way, of, thinking, just, as, the, right, is, only, the, expedient, in, our, way, of, behaving, by, this, james, meant, that, truth, is, a, quality, the, value, of, which, is, confirmed, by, its, effectiveness, when, applying, concepts, to, practice, thus, pragmatic, john, dewey, less, broadly, than, james, but, more, broadly, than, peirce, held, that, inquiry, whether, scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical, or, cultural, is, self, corrective, over, time, if, openly, submitted, for, testing, by, a, community, of, inquirers, in, order, to, clarify, justify, refine, and, or, refute, proposed, meanings, and, truths, a, later, variation, of, the, pragmatic, theory, was, william, ernest, hocking, s, negative, pragmatism, what, works, may, or, may, not, be, true, but, what, fails, cannot, be, true, because, the, truth, and, its, meaning, always, works, james, s, and, dewey, s, ideas, also, ascribe, meaning, and, truth, to, repeated, testing, which, is, self, corrective, over, time, pragmatism, and, negative, pragmatism, are, also, closely, aligned, with, the, coherence, theory, of, truth, in, that, any, testing, should, not, be, isolated, but, rather, incorporate, knowledge, from, all, human, endeavors, and, experience, the, universe, is, a, whole, and, integrated, system, and, testing, should, acknowledge, and, account, for, its, diversity, as, physicist, richard, feynman, said, if, it, disagrees, with, experiment, it, is, wrong, some, have, asserted, that, meaning, is, nothing, substantially, more, or, less, than, the, truth, conditions, they, involve, for, such, theories, an, emphasis, is, placed, upon, reference, to, actual, things, in, the, world, to, account, for, meaning, with, the, caveat, that, reference, more, or, less, explains, the, greater, part, or, all, of, meaning, itself, the, logical, positivists, argued, that, the, meaning, of, a, statement, arose, from, how, it, is, verified, in, his, paper, ber, sinn, und, bedeutung, now, usually, translated, as, on, sense, and, reference, gottlob, frege, argued, that, proper, names, present, at, least, two, problems, in, explaining, meaning, frege, can, be, interpreted, as, arguing, that, it, was, therefore, a, mistake, to, think, that, the, meaning, of, a, name, is, the, thing, it, refers, to, instead, the, meaning, must, be, something, else, the, sense, of, the, word, two, names, for, the, same, person, then, can, have, different, senses, or, meanings, one, referent, might, be, picked, out, by, more, than, one, sense, this, sort, of, theory, is, called, a, mediated, reference, theory, frege, argued, that, ultimately, the, same, bifurcation, of, meaning, must, apply, to, most, or, all, linguistic, categories, such, as, to, quantificational, expressions, like, all, boats, float, logical, analysis, was, further, advanced, by, bertrand, russell, and, alfred, north, whitehead, in, their, groundbreaking, principia, mathematica, which, attempted, to, produce, a, formal, language, with, which, the, truth, of, all, mathematical, statements, could, be, demonstrated, from, first, principles, russell, differed, from, frege, greatly, on, many, points, however, he, rejected, frege, s, sense, reference, distinction, he, also, disagreed, that, language, was, of, fundamental, significance, to, philosophy, and, saw, the, project, of, developing, formal, logic, as, a, way, of, eliminating, all, of, the, confusions, caused, by, ordinary, language, and, hence, at, creating, a, perfectly, transparent, medium, in, which, to, conduct, traditional, philosophical, argument, he, hoped, ultimately, to, extend, the, proofs, of, the, principia, to, all, possible, true, statements, a, scheme, he, called, logical, atomism, for, a, while, it, appeared, that, his, pupil, wittgenstein, had, succeeded, in, this, plan, with, his, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, russell, s, work, and, that, of, his, colleague, g, e, moore, developed, in, response, to, what, they, perceived, as, the, nonsense, dominating, british, philosophy, departments, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, which, was, a, kind, of, british, idealism, most, of, which, was, derived, albeit, very, distantly, from, the, work, of, hegel, in, response, moore, developed, an, approach, common, sense, philosophy, which, sought, to, examine, philosophical, difficulties, by, a, close, analysis, of, the, language, used, in, order, to, determine, its, meaning, in, this, way, moore, sought, to, expunge, philosophical, absurdities, such, as, time, is, unreal, moore, s, work, would, have, significant, if, oblique, influence, largely, mediated, by, wittgenstein, on, ordinary, language, philosophy, the, vienna, circle, a, famous, group, of, logical, positivists, from, the, early, 20th, century, closely, allied, with, russell, and, frege, adopted, the, verificationist, theory, of, meaning, a, type, of, truth, theory, of, meaning, the, verificationist, theory, of, meaning, in, at, least, one, of, its, forms, states, that, to, say, that, an, expression, is, meaningful, is, to, say, that, there, are, some, conditions, of, experience, that, could, exist, to, show, that, the, expression, is, true, as, noted, frege, and, russell, were, two, proponents, of, this, way, of, thinking, a, semantic, theory, of, truth, was, produced, by, alfred, tarski, for, formal, semantics, according, to, tarski, s, account, meaning, consists, of, a, recursive, set, of, rules, that, end, up, yielding, an, infinite, set, of, sentences, p, is, true, if, and, only, if, p, covering, the, whole, language, his, innovation, produced, the, notion, of, propositional, functions, discussed, on, the, section, on, universals, which, he, called, sentential, functions, and, a, model, theoretic, approach, to, semantics, as, opposed, to, a, proof, theoretic, one, finally, some, links, were, forged, to, the, correspondence, theory, of, truth, tarski, 1944, perhaps, the, most, influential, current, approach, in, the, contemporary, theory, of, meaning, is, that, sketched, by, donald, davidson, in, his, introduction, to, the, collection, of, essays, truth, and, meaning, in, 1967, there, he, argued, for, the, following, two, theses, the, result, is, a, theory, of, meaning, that, rather, resembles, by, no, accident, tarski, s, account, davidson, s, account, though, brief, constitutes, the, first, systematic, presentation, of, truth, conditional, semantics, he, proposed, simply, translating, natural, languages, into, first, order, predicate, calculus, in, order, to, reduce, meaning, to, a, function, of, truth, saul, kripke, examined, the, relation, between, sense, and, reference, in, dealing, with, possible, and, actual, situations, he, showed, that, one, consequence, of, his, interpretation, of, certain, systems, of, modal, logic, was, that, the, reference, of, a, proper, name, is, necessarily, linked, to, its, referent, but, that, the, sense, is, not, so, for, instance, hesperus, necessarily, refers, to, hesperus, even, in, those, imaginary, cases, and, worlds, in, which, perhaps, hesperus, is, not, the, evening, star, that, is, hesperus, is, necessarily, hesperus, but, only, contingently, the, morning, star, this, results, in, the, curious, situation, that, part, of, the, meaning, of, a, name, that, it, refers, to, some, particular, thing, is, a, necessary, fact, about, that, name, but, another, part, that, it, is, used, in, some, particular, way, or, situation, is, not, kripke, also, drew, the, distinction, between, speaker, s, meaning, and, semantic, meaning, elaborating, on, the, work, of, ordinary, language, philosophers, paul, grice, and, keith, donnellan, the, speaker, s, meaning, is, what, the, speaker, intends, to, refer, to, by, saying, something, the, semantic, meaning, is, what, the, words, uttered, by, the, speaker, mean, according, to, the, language, in, some, cases, people, do, not, say, what, they, mean, in, other, cases, they, say, something, that, is, in, error, in, both, these, cases, the, speaker, s, meaning, and, the, semantic, meaning, seem, to, be, different, sometimes, words, do, not, actually, express, what, the, speaker, wants, them, to, express, so, words, will, mean, one, thing, and, what, people, intend, to, convey, by, them, might, mean, another, the, meaning, of, the, expression, in, such, cases, is, ambiguous, w, v, o, quine, attacked, both, verificationism, and, the, very, notion, of, meaning, in, his, famous, essay, two, dogmas, of, empiricism, in, it, he, suggested, that, meaning, was, nothing, more, than, a, vague, and, dispensable, notion, instead, he, asserted, what, was, more, interesting, to, study, was, the, synonymy, between, signs, he, also, pointed, out, that, verificationism, was, tied, to, the, distinction, between, analytic, and, synthetic, statements, and, asserted, that, such, a, divide, was, defended, ambiguously, he, also, suggested, that, the, unit, of, analysis, for, any, potential, investigation, into, the, world, and, perhaps, meaning, would, be, the, entire, body, of, statements, taken, as, a, collective, not, just, individual, statements, on, their, own, other, criticisms, can, be, raised, on, the, basis, of, the, limitations, that, truth, conditional, theorists, themselves, admit, to, tarski, for, instance, recognized, that, truth, conditional, theories, of, meaning, only, make, sense, of, statements, but, fail, to, explain, the, meanings, of, the, lexical, parts, that, make, up, statements, rather, the, meaning, of, the, parts, of, statements, is, presupposed, by, an, understanding, of, the, truth, conditions, of, a, whole, statement, and, explained, in, terms, of, what, he, called, satisfaction, conditions, still, another, objection, noted, by, frege, and, others, was, that, some, kinds, of, statements, do, not, seem, to, have, any, truth, conditions, at, all, for, instance, hello, has, no, truth, conditions, because, it, does, not, even, attempt, to, tell, the, listener, anything, about, the, state, of, affairs, in, the, world, in, other, words, different, propositions, have, different, grammatical, moods, deflationist, accounts, of, truth, sometimes, called, irrealist, accounts, are, the, staunchest, source, of, criticism, of, truth, conditional, theories, of, meaning, according, to, them, truth, is, a, word, with, no, serious, meaning, or, function, in, discourse, for, instance, for, the, deflationist, the, sentences, it, s, true, that, tiny, tim, is, trouble, and, tiny, tim, is, trouble, are, equivalent, in, consequence, for, the, deflationist, any, appeal, to, truth, as, an, account, of, meaning, has, little, explanatory, power, the, sort, of, truth, theories, presented, here, can, also, be, attacked, for, their, formalism, both, in, practice, and, principle, the, principle, of, formalism, is, challenged, by, the, informalists, who, suggest, that, language, is, largely, a, construction, of, the, speaker, and, so, not, compatible, with, formalization, the, practice, of, formalism, is, challenged, by, those, who, observe, that, formal, languages, such, as, present, day, quantificational, logic, fail, to, capture, the, expressive, power, of, natural, languages, as, is, arguably, demonstrated, in, the, awkward, character, of, the, quantificational, explanation, of, definite, description, statements, as, laid, out, by, bertrand, russell, finally, over, the, past, century, forms, of, logic, have, been, developed, that, are, not, dependent, exclusively, on, the, notions, of, truth, and, falsity, some, of, these, types, of, logic, have, been, called, modal, logics, they, explain, how, certain, logical, connectives, such, as, if, then, work, in, terms, of, necessity, and, possibility, indeed, modal, logic, was, the, basis, of, one, of, the, most, popular, and, rigorous, formulations, in, modern, semantics, called, the, montague, grammar, the, successes, of, such, systems, naturally, give, rise, to, the, argument, that, these, systems, have, captured, the, natural, meaning, of, connectives, like, if, then, far, better, than, an, ordinary, truth, functional, logic, ever, could, throughout, the, 20th, century, english, philosophy, focused, closely, on, analysis, of, language, this, style, of, analytic, philosophy, became, very, influential, and, led, to, the, development, of, a, wide, range, of, philosophical, tools, the, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, was, originally, an, ideal, language, philosopher, following, the, influence, of, russell, and, frege, in, his, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, he, had, supported, the, idea, of, an, ideal, language, built, up, from, atomic, statements, using, logical, connectives, see, picture, theory, of, meaning, and, logical, atomism, however, as, he, matured, he, came, to, appreciate, more, and, more, the, phenomenon, of, natural, language, philosophical, investigations, published, after, his, death, signalled, a, sharp, departure, from, his, earlier, work, with, its, focus, upon, ordinary, language, use, see, use, theory, of, meaning, and, ordinary, language, philosophy, his, approach, is, often, summarised, by, the, aphorism, the, meaning, of, a, word, is, its, use, in, a, language, however, following, in, frege, s, footsteps, in, the, tractatus, wittgenstein, declares, only, in, the, context, of, a, proposition, has, a, name, meaning, his, work, would, come, to, inspire, future, generations, and, spur, forward, a, whole, new, discipline, which, explained, meaning, in, a, new, way, meaning, in, a, natural, language, was, seen, as, primarily, a, question, of, how, the, speaker, uses, words, within, the, language, to, express, intention, this, close, examination, of, natural, language, proved, to, be, a, powerful, philosophical, technique, practitioners, who, were, influenced, by, wittgenstein, s, approach, have, included, an, entire, tradition, of, thinkers, featuring, p, f, strawson, paul, grice, r, m, hare, r, s, peters, and, j, rgen, habermas, at, around, the, same, time, ludwig, wittgenstein, was, re, thinking, his, approach, to, language, reflections, on, the, complexity, of, language, led, to, a, more, expansive, approach, to, meaning, following, the, lead, of, george, edward, moore, j, l, austin, examined, the, use, of, words, in, great, detail, he, argued, against, fixating, on, the, meaning, of, words, he, showed, that, dictionary, definitions, are, of, limited, philosophical, use, since, there, is, no, simple, appendage, to, a, word, that, can, be, called, its, meaning, instead, he, showed, how, to, focus, on, the, way, in, which, words, are, used, in, order, to, do, things, he, analysed, the, structure, of, utterances, into, three, distinct, parts, locutions, illocutions, and, perlocutions, his, pupil, john, searle, developed, the, idea, under, the, label, speech, acts, their, work, greatly, influenced, pragmatics, past, philosophers, had, understood, reference, to, be, tied, to, words, themselves, however, peter, strawson, disagreed, in, his, seminal, essay, on, referring, where, he, argued, that, there, is, nothing, true, about, statements, on, their, own, rather, only, the, uses, of, statements, could, be, considered, to, be, true, or, false, indeed, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, the, ordinary, use, perspective, is, its, insistence, upon, the, distinctions, between, meaning, and, use, meanings, for, ordinary, language, philosophers, are, the, instructions, for, usage, of, words, the, common, and, conventional, definitions, of, words, usage, on, the, other, hand, is, the, actual, meanings, that, individual, speakers, have, the, things, that, an, individual, speaker, in, a, particular, context, wants, to, refer, to, the, word, dog, is, an, example, of, a, meaning, but, pointing, at, a, nearby, dog, and, shouting, this, dog, smells, foul, is, an, example, of, usage, from, this, distinction, between, usage, and, meaning, arose, the, divide, between, the, fields, of, pragmatics, and, semantics, yet, another, distinction, is, of, some, utility, in, discussing, language, mentioning, mention, is, when, an, expression, refers, to, itself, as, a, linguistic, item, usually, surrounded, by, quotation, marks, for, instance, in, the, expression, opopanax, is, hard, to, spell, what, is, referred, to, is, the, word, itself, opopanax, and, not, what, it, means, an, obscure, gum, resin, frege, had, referred, to, instances, of, mentioning, as, opaque, contexts, in, his, essay, reference, and, definite, descriptions, keith, donnellan, sought, to, improve, upon, strawson, s, distinction, he, pointed, out, that, there, are, two, uses, of, definite, descriptions, attributive, and, referential, attributive, uses, provide, a, description, of, whoever, is, being, referred, to, while, referential, uses, point, out, the, actual, referent, attributive, uses, are, like, mediated, references, while, referential, uses, are, more, directly, referential, the, philosopher, paul, grice, working, within, the, ordinary, language, tradition, understood, meaning, in, his, 1957, article, to, have, two, kinds, natural, and, non, natural, natural, meaning, had, to, do, with, cause, and, effect, for, example, with, the, expression, these, spots, mean, measles, non, natural, meaning, on, the, other, hand, had, to, do, with, the, intentions, of, the, speaker, in, communicating, something, to, the, listener, in, his, essay, logic, and, conversation, grice, went, on, to, explain, and, defend, an, explanation, of, how, conversations, work, his, guiding, maxim, was, called, the, cooperative, principle, which, claimed, that, the, speaker, and, the, listener, will, have, mutual, expectations, of, the, kind, of, information, that, will, be, shared, the, principle, is, broken, down, into, four, maxims, quality, which, demands, truthfulness, and, honesty, quantity, demand, for, just, enough, information, as, is, required, relation, relevance, of, things, brought, up, and, manner, lucidity, this, principle, if, and, when, followed, lets, the, speaker, and, listener, figure, out, the, meaning, of, certain, implications, by, way, of, inference, the, works, of, grice, led, to, an, avalanche, of, research, and, interest, in, the, field, both, supportive, and, critical, one, spinoff, was, called, relevance, theory, developed, by, dan, sperber, and, deirdre, wilson, during, the, mid, 1980s, whose, goal, was, to, make, the, notion, of, relevance, more, clear, similarly, in, his, work, universal, pragmatics, j, rgen, habermas, began, a, program, that, sought, to, improve, upon, the, work, of, the, ordinary, language, tradition, in, it, he, laid, out, the, goal, of, a, valid, conversation, as, a, pursuit, of, mutual, understanding, although, he, has, focused, on, the, structure, and, functioning, of, human, syntax, in, many, works, noam, chomsky, has, discussed, many, philosophical, problems, too, including, the, problem, of, meaning, and, reference, in, human, language, chomsky, has, formulated, a, strong, criticism, against, both, the, externalist, notion, of, reference, reference, consists, in, a, direct, or, causal, relation, among, words, and, objects, and, the, internalist, one, reference, is, a, mind, mediated, relation, holding, among, words, and, reality, according, to, chomsky, both, these, notions, and, many, others, widely, used, in, philosophy, such, as, that, of, truth, are, basically, inadequate, for, the, naturalistic, scientific, inquiry, on, human, mind, they, are, common, sense, notions, not, scientific, notions, which, cannot, as, such, enter, in, the, scientific, discussion, chomsky, argues, that, the, notion, of, reference, can, be, used, only, when, we, deal, with, scientific, languages, whose, symbols, refers, to, specific, things, or, entities, but, when, we, consider, human, language, expressions, we, immediately, understand, that, their, reference, is, vague, in, the, sense, that, they, can, be, used, to, denote, many, things, for, example, the, word, book, can, be, used, to, denote, an, abstract, object, e, g, he, is, reading, the, book, or, a, concrete, one, e, g, the, book, is, on, the, chair, the, name, london, can, denote, at, the, same, time, a, set, of, buildings, the, air, of, a, place, and, the, character, of, a, population, think, to, the, sentence, london, is, so, gray, polluted, and, sad, these, and, other, cases, induce, chomsky, to, argue, that, the, only, plausible, although, not, scientific, notion, of, reference, is, that, of, act, of, reference, a, complex, phenomenon, of, language, use, performance, which, includes, many, factors, linguistic, and, not, i, e, beliefs, desires, assumptions, about, the, world, premises, etc, as, chomsky, himself, has, pointed, out, this, conception, of, meaning, is, very, close, to, that, adopted, by, john, austin, peter, strawson, and, the, late, wittgenstein, michael, dummett, argued, against, the, kind, of, truth, conditional, semantics, presented, by, davidson, instead, he, argued, that, basing, semantics, on, assertion, conditions, avoids, a, number, of, difficulties, with, truth, conditional, semantics, such, as, the, transcendental, nature, of, certain, kinds, of, truth, condition, he, leverages, work, done, in, proof, theoretic, semantics, to, provide, a, kind, of, inferential, role, semantics, where, a, semantics, based, upon, assertion, conditions, is, called, a, verificationist, semantics, cf, the, verificationism, of, the, vienna, circle, this, work, is, closely, related, though, not, identical, to, one, factor, theories, of, conceptual, role, semantics, sometimes, between, the, 1950, 1990s, cognitive, scientist, jerry, fodor, said, that, use, theories, of, meaning, of, the, wittgensteinian, kind, seem, to, assume, that, language, is, solely, a, public, phenomenon, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, private, language, fodor, thinks, it, is, necessary, to, create, or, describe, the, language, of, thought, which, would, seemingly, require, the, existence, of, a, private, language, in, the, 1960s, david, kellogg, lewis, described, meaning, as, use, a, feature, of, a, social, convention, and, conventions, as, regularities, of, a, specific, sort, lewis, work, was, an, application, of, game, theory, in, philosophical, topics, conventions, he, argued, are, a, species, of, coordination, equilibria, the, idea, theory, of, meaning, also, ideational, theory, of, meaning, most, commonly, associated, with, the, british, empiricist, john, locke, claims, that, meanings, are, mental, representations, provoked, by, signs, the, term, ideas, is, used, to, refer, to, either, mental, representations, or, to, mental, activity, in, general, those, who, seek, an, explanation, for, meaning, in, the, former, sort, of, account, endorse, a, stronger, sort, of, idea, theory, of, mind, than, the, latter, each, idea, is, understood, to, be, necessarily, about, something, external, and, or, internal, real, or, imaginary, for, example, in, contrast, to, the, abstract, meaning, of, the, universal, dog, the, referent, this, dog, may, mean, a, particular, real, life, chihuahua, in, both, cases, the, word, is, about, something, but, in, the, former, it, is, about, the, class, of, dogs, as, generally, understood, while, in, the, latter, it, is, about, a, very, real, and, particular, dog, in, the, real, world, john, locke, considered, all, ideas, to, be, both, imaginable, objects, of, sensation, and, the, very, un, imaginable, objects, of, reflection, he, said, in, his, essay, concerning, human, understanding, that, words, are, used, both, as, signs, for, ideas, and, also, to, signify, a, lack, of, certain, ideas, david, hume, held, that, thoughts, were, kinds, of, imaginable, entities, his, enquiry, concerning, human, understanding, section, 2, he, argued, that, any, words, that, could, not, call, upon, any, past, experience, were, without, meaning, in, contrast, to, locke, and, hume, george, berkeley, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, held, that, ideas, alone, are, unable, to, account, for, the, different, variations, within, a, general, meaning, for, example, any, hypothetical, image, of, the, meaning, of, dog, has, to, include, such, varied, images, as, a, chihuahua, a, pug, and, a, black, labrador, and, this, seems, impossible, to, imagine, since, all, of, those, particular, breeds, look, very, different, from, one, another, another, way, to, see, this, point, is, to, question, why, it, is, that, if, we, have, an, image, of, a, specific, type, of, dog, say, of, a, chihuahua, it, should, be, entitled, to, represent, the, entire, concept, another, criticism, is, that, some, meaningful, words, known, as, non, lexical, items, do, not, have, any, meaningfully, associated, image, for, example, the, word, the, has, a, meaning, but, one, would, be, hard, pressed, to, find, a, mental, representation, that, fits, it, still, another, objection, lies, in, the, observation, that, certain, linguistic, items, name, something, in, the, real, world, and, are, meaningful, yet, which, we, have, no, mental, representations, to, deal, with, for, instance, it, is, not, known, what, newton, s, father, looked, like, yet, the, phrase, newton, s, father, still, has, meaning, another, problem, is, that, of, composition, that, it, is, difficult, to, explain, how, words, and, phrases, combine, into, sentences, if, only, ideas, are, involved, in, meaning, eleanor, rosch, and, george, lakoff, have, advanced, a, theory, of, prototypes, which, suggests, that, many, lexical, categories, at, least, on, the, face, of, things, have, radial, structures, that, is, to, say, there, are, some, ideal, member, s, in, the, category, that, seem, to, represent, the, category, better, than, other, members, for, example, the, category, of, birds, may, feature, the, robin, as, the, prototype, or, the, ideal, kind, of, bird, with, experience, subjects, might, come, to, evaluate, membership, in, the, category, of, bird, by, comparing, candidate, members, to, the, prototype, and, evaluating, for, similarities, so, for, example, a, penguin, or, an, ostrich, would, sit, at, the, fringe, of, the, meaning, of, bird, because, a, penguin, is, unlike, a, robin, intimately, related, to, these, researches, is, the, notion, of, a, psychologically, basic, level, which, is, both, the, first, level, named, and, understood, by, children, and, the, highest, level, at, which, a, single, mental, image, can, reflect, the, entire, category, lakoff, 1987, 46, the, basic, level, of, cognition, is, understood, by, lakoff, as, crucially, drawing, upon, image, schemas, along, with, various, other, cognitive, processes, philosophers, ned, block, gilbert, harman, and, hartry, field, and, cognitive, scientists, g, miller, and, p, johnson, laird, say, that, the, meaning, of, a, term, can, be, found, by, investigating, its, role, in, relation, to, other, concepts, and, mental, states, they, endorse, a, conceptual, role, semantics, those, proponents, of, this, view, who, understand, meanings, to, be, exhausted, by, the, content, of, mental, states, can, be, said, to, endorse, one, factor, accounts, of, conceptual, role, semantics, and, thus, to, fit, within, the, tradition, of, idea, theories
