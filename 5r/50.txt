a, paradox, is, a, logically, self, contradictory, statement, or, a, statement, that, runs, contrary, to, one, s, expectation, it, is, a, statement, that, despite, apparently, valid, reasoning, from, true, or, apparently, true, premises, leads, to, a, seemingly, self, contradictory, or, a, logically, unacceptable, conclusion, a, paradox, usually, involves, contradictory, yet, interrelated, elements, that, exist, simultaneously, and, persist, over, time, they, result, in, persistent, contradiction, between, interdependent, elements, leading, to, a, lasting, unity, of, opposites, in, logic, many, paradoxes, exist, that, are, known, to, be, invalid, arguments, yet, are, nevertheless, valuable, in, promoting, critical, thinking, while, other, paradoxes, have, revealed, errors, in, definitions, that, were, assumed, to, be, rigorous, and, have, caused, axioms, of, mathematics, and, logic, to, be, re, examined, one, example, is, russell, s, paradox, which, questions, whether, a, list, of, all, lists, that, do, not, contain, themselves, would, include, itself, and, showed, that, attempts, to, found, set, theory, on, the, identification, of, sets, with, properties, or, predicates, were, flawed, others, such, as, curry, s, paradox, cannot, be, easily, resolved, by, making, foundational, changes, in, a, logical, system, examples, outside, logic, include, the, ship, of, theseus, from, philosophy, a, paradox, that, questions, whether, a, ship, repaired, over, time, by, replacing, each, and, all, of, its, wooden, parts, one, at, a, time, would, remain, the, same, ship, paradoxes, can, also, take, the, form, of, images, or, other, media, for, example, m, c, escher, featured, perspective, based, paradoxes, in, many, of, his, drawings, with, walls, that, are, regarded, as, floors, from, other, points, of, view, and, staircases, that, appear, to, climb, endlessly, informally, the, term, paradox, is, often, used, to, describe, a, counterintuitive, result, self, reference, contradiction, and, infinite, regress, are, core, elements, of, many, paradoxes, other, common, elements, include, circular, definitions, and, confusion, or, equivocation, between, different, levels, of, abstraction, self, reference, occurs, when, a, sentence, idea, or, formula, refers, to, itself, although, statements, can, be, self, referential, without, being, paradoxical, this, statement, is, written, in, english, is, a, true, and, non, paradoxical, self, referential, statement, self, reference, is, a, common, element, of, paradoxes, one, example, occurs, in, the, liar, paradox, which, is, commonly, formulated, as, the, self, referential, statement, this, statement, is, false, another, example, occurs, in, the, barber, paradox, which, poses, the, question, of, whether, a, barber, who, shaves, all, and, only, those, men, who, do, not, shave, themselves, will, shave, himself, in, this, paradox, the, barber, is, a, self, referential, concept, contradiction, along, with, self, reference, is, a, core, feature, of, many, paradoxes, the, liar, paradox, this, statement, is, false, exhibits, contradiction, because, the, statement, cannot, be, false, and, true, at, the, same, time, the, barber, paradox, is, contradictory, because, it, implies, that, the, barber, shaves, himself, if, and, only, if, the, barber, does, not, shave, himself, as, with, self, reference, a, statement, can, contain, a, contradiction, without, being, a, paradox, this, statement, is, written, in, french, is, an, example, of, a, contradictory, self, referential, statement, that, is, not, a, paradox, and, is, instead, false, another, core, aspect, of, paradoxes, is, non, terminating, recursion, in, the, form, of, circular, reasoning, or, infinite, regress, when, this, recursion, creates, a, metaphysical, impossibility, through, contradiction, the, regress, or, circularity, is, vicious, again, the, liar, paradox, is, an, instructive, example, this, statement, is, false, if, the, statement, is, true, then, the, statement, is, false, thereby, making, the, statement, true, thereby, making, the, statement, false, and, so, on, the, barber, paradox, also, exemplifies, vicious, circularity, the, barber, shaves, those, who, do, not, shave, themselves, so, if, the, barber, does, not, shave, himself, then, he, shaves, himself, then, he, does, not, shave, himself, and, so, on, other, paradoxes, involve, false, statements, and, half, truths, impossible, is, not, in, my, vocabulary, or, rely, on, hasty, assumptions, a, father, and, his, son, are, in, a, car, crash, the, father, is, killed, and, the, boy, is, rushed, to, the, hospital, the, doctor, says, i, can, t, operate, on, this, boy, he, s, my, son, there, is, no, contradiction, the, doctor, is, the, boy, s, mother, paradoxes, that, are, not, based, on, a, hidden, error, generally, occur, at, the, fringes, of, context, or, language, and, require, extending, the, context, or, language, in, order, to, lose, their, paradoxical, quality, paradoxes, that, arise, from, apparently, intelligible, uses, of, language, are, often, of, interest, to, logicians, and, philosophers, this, sentence, is, false, is, an, example, of, the, well, known, liar, paradox, it, is, a, sentence, that, cannot, be, consistently, interpreted, as, either, true, or, false, because, if, it, is, known, to, be, false, then, it, can, be, inferred, that, it, must, be, true, and, if, it, is, known, to, be, true, then, it, can, be, inferred, that, it, must, be, false, russell, s, paradox, which, shows, that, the, notion, of, the, set, of, all, those, sets, that, do, not, contain, themselves, leads, to, a, contradiction, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, modern, logic, and, set, theory, thought, experiments, can, also, yield, interesting, paradoxes, the, grandfather, paradox, for, example, would, arise, if, a, time, traveler, were, to, kill, his, own, grandfather, before, his, mother, or, father, had, been, conceived, thereby, preventing, his, own, birth, this, is, a, specific, example, of, the, more, general, observation, of, the, butterfly, effect, or, that, a, time, traveller, s, interaction, with, the, past, however, slight, would, entail, making, changes, that, would, in, turn, change, the, future, in, which, the, time, travel, was, yet, to, occur, and, would, thus, change, the, circumstances, of, the, time, travel, itself, often, a, seemingly, paradoxical, conclusion, arises, from, an, inconsistent, or, inherently, contradictory, definition, of, the, initial, premise, in, the, case, of, that, apparent, paradox, of, a, time, traveler, killing, his, own, grandfather, it, is, the, inconsistency, of, defining, the, past, to, which, he, returns, as, being, somehow, different, from, the, one, that, leads, up, to, the, future, from, which, he, begins, his, trip, but, also, insisting, that, he, must, have, come, to, that, past, from, the, same, future, as, the, one, that, it, leads, up, to, w, v, o, quine, 1962, distinguished, between, three, classes, of, paradoxes, a, veridical, paradox, produces, a, result, that, appears, counter, to, intuition, but, is, demonstrated, to, be, true, nonetheless, a, falsidical, paradox, establishes, a, result, that, appears, false, and, actually, is, false, due, to, a, fallacy, in, the, demonstration, therefore, falsidical, paradoxes, can, be, classified, as, fallacious, arguments, an, antinomy, is, a, paradox, which, reaches, a, self, contradictory, result, by, properly, applying, accepted, ways, of, reasoning, for, example, the, grelling, nelson, paradox, points, out, genuine, problems, in, our, understanding, of, the, ideas, of, truth, and, description, sometimes, described, since, quine, s, work, a, dialetheia, is, a, paradox, that, is, both, true, and, false, at, the, same, time, it, may, be, regarded, as, a, fourth, kind, or, alternatively, as, a, special, case, of, antinomy, in, logic, it, is, often, assumed, following, aristotle, that, no, dialetheia, exist, but, they, are, allowed, in, some, paraconsistent, logics, frank, ramsey, drew, a, distinction, between, logical, paradoxes, and, semantic, paradoxes, with, russell, s, paradox, belonging, to, the, former, category, and, the, liar, paradox, and, grelling, s, paradoxes, to, the, latter, ramsey, introduced, the, by, now, standard, distinction, between, logical, and, semantical, contradictions, logical, contradictions, involve, mathematical, or, logical, terms, like, class, and, number, and, hence, show, that, our, logic, or, mathematics, is, problematic, semantical, contradictions, involve, besides, purely, logical, terms, notions, like, thought, language, and, symbolism, which, according, to, ramsey, are, empirical, not, formal, terms, hence, these, contradictions, are, due, to, faulty, ideas, about, thought, or, language, and, they, properly, belong, to, epistemology, a, taste, for, paradox, is, central, to, the, philosophies, of, laozi, zeno, of, elea, zhuangzi, heraclitus, bhartrhari, meister, eckhart, hegel, kierkegaard, nietzsche, and, g, k, chesterton, among, many, others, s, ren, kierkegaard, for, example, writes, in, the, philosophical, fragments, that, but, one, must, not, think, ill, of, the, paradox, for, the, paradox, is, the, passion, of, thought, and, the, thinker, without, the, paradox, is, like, the, lover, without, passion, a, mediocre, fellow, but, the, ultimate, potentiation, of, every, passion, is, always, to, will, its, own, downfall, and, so, it, is, also, the, ultimate, passion, of, the, understanding, to, will, the, collision, although, in, one, way, or, another, the, collision, must, become, its, downfall, this, then, is, the, ultimate, paradox, of, thought, to, want, to, discover, something, that, thought, itself, cannot, think, a, paradoxical, reaction, to, a, drug, is, the, opposite, of, what, one, would, expect, such, as, becoming, agitated, by, a, sedative, or, sedated, by, a, stimulant, some, are, common, and, are, used, regularly, in, medicine, such, as, the, use, of, stimulants, such, as, adderall, and, ritalin, in, the, treatment, of, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, also, known, as, adhd, while, others, are, rare, and, can, be, dangerous, as, they, are, not, expected, such, as, severe, agitation, from, a, benzodiazepine, the, actions, of, antibodies, on, antigens, can, rarely, take, paradoxical, turns, in, certain, ways, one, example, is, antibody, dependent, enhancement, immune, enhancement, of, a, disease, s, virulence, another, is, the, hook, effect, prozone, effect, of, which, there, are, several, types, however, neither, of, these, problems, is, common, and, overall, antibodies, are, crucial, to, health, as, most, of, the, time, they, do, their, protective, job, quite, well, in, the, smoker, s, paradox, cigarette, smoking, despite, its, proven, harms, has, a, surprising, inverse, correlation, with, the, epidemiological, incidence, of, certain, diseases
