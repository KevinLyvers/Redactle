several, thousand, years, some, can, be, found, in, the, i, ching, the, book, of, changes, an, ancient, compendium, of, divination, which, dates, back, to, at, least, 672, bce, the, han, dynasty, records, of, the, grand, historian, by, sima, tan, looked, back, on, the, warring, states, era, and, grouped, the, thinkers, into, the, major, philosophical, schools, confucianism, legalism, and, taoism, along, with, philosophies, that, later, fell, into, obscurity, like, agriculturalism, mohism, chinese, naturalism, and, the, logicians, even, in, modern, society, confucianism, is, still, the, creed, of, social, behaviour, the, debate, over, whether, the, thought, of, ancient, chinese, masters, should, be, called, philosophy, has, been, discussed, since, the, introduction, of, this, academic, discipline, into, china, see, legitimacy, of, chinese, philosophy, for, details, early, shang, dynasty, thought, was, based, on, cycles, like, the, 10, stems, and, 12, earthly, branches, this, notion, stems, from, what, the, people, of, the, shang, dynasty, could, observe, around, them, day, and, night, cycles, the, seasons, progressed, again, and, again, and, even, the, moon, waxed, and, waned, until, it, waxed, again, thus, this, notion, which, remained, relevant, throughout, chinese, history, reflects, the, order, of, nature, in, juxtaposition, it, also, marks, a, fundamental, distinction, from, western, philosophy, in, which, the, dominant, view, of, time, is, a, linear, progression, during, the, shang, ancestor, worship, was, present, and, universally, recognized, when, the, shang, were, overthrown, by, the, zhou, a, new, political, religious, and, philosophical, concept, was, introduced, called, the, mandate, of, heaven, this, mandate, was, said, to, be, taken, when, rulers, became, unworthy, of, their, position, and, provided, a, justification, for, zhou, rule, it, is, said, that, the, duke, of, zhou, made, the, early, solar, terms, by, measuring, with, a, gnomon, that, was, added, to, make, the, complete, solar, terms, he, is, also, said, to, have, used, try, squares, and, wrote, the, zhoubi, suanjing, with, his, astrologer, several, early, beliefs, might, be, found, in, the, guicang, and, perhaps, the, earliest, chinese, book, the, small, calendar, of, the, xia, in, da, dai, liji, though, debated, to, exist, the, xia, dynasty, is, said, to, be, its, origin, confucianism, developed, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, from, the, teachings, of, the, chinese, philosopher, confucius, 551, 479, bce, who, considered, himself, a, retransmitter, of, zhou, values, his, philosophy, concerns, the, fields, of, ethics, and, politics, emphasizing, personal, and, governmental, morality, correctness, of, social, relationships, justice, traditionalism, and, sincerity, the, analects, stress, the, importance, of, ritual, but, also, the, importance, of, ren, which, loosely, translates, as, human, heartedness, confucianism, along, with, legalism, is, responsible, for, creating, one, of, the, world, s, first, meritocracies, which, holds, that, one, s, status, should, be, determined, by, education, and, character, rather, than, ancestry, wealth, or, friendship, confucianism, was, and, continues, to, be, a, major, influence, in, chinese, culture, the, state, of, china, and, the, surrounding, areas, of, east, asia, before, the, han, dynasty, the, largest, rivals, to, confucianism, were, chinese, legalism, and, mohism, confucianism, largely, became, the, dominant, philosophical, school, of, china, during, the, early, han, dynasty, following, the, replacement, of, its, contemporary, the, more, taoist, huang, lao, legalism, as, a, coherent, philosophy, disappeared, largely, due, to, its, relationship, with, the, unpopular, authoritarian, rule, of, qin, shi, huang, however, many, of, its, ideas, and, institutions, would, continue, to, influence, chinese, philosophy, throughout, the, han, dynasty, and, after, mohism, though, initially, popular, due, to, its, emphasis, on, brotherly, love, versus, harsh, legalism, fell, out, of, favour, during, the, han, dynasty, due, to, the, efforts, of, confucians, in, establishing, their, views, as, political, orthodoxy, the, six, dynasties, era, saw, the, rise, of, the, xuanxue, philosophical, school, and, the, maturation, of, chinese, buddhism, which, had, entered, china, from, india, during, the, late, han, dynasties, by, the, time, of, the, tang, dynasty, five, hundred, years, after, buddhism, s, arrival, into, china, it, had, transformed, into, a, thoroughly, chinese, religious, philosophy, dominated, by, the, school, of, zen, buddhism, neo, confucianism, became, highly, popular, during, the, song, dynasty, and, ming, dynasty, due, in, large, part, to, the, eventual, combination, of, confucian, and, buddhist, and, even, taoist, philosophy, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, chinese, philosophy, integrated, concepts, from, western, philosophy, anti, qing, dynasty, revolutionaries, involved, in, the, xinhai, revolution, saw, western, philosophy, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, philosophical, schools, students, in, the, may, fourth, movement, called, for, completely, abolishing, the, old, imperial, institutions, and, practices, of, china, during, this, era, chinese, scholars, attempted, to, incorporate, western, philosophical, ideologies, such, as, democracy, marxism, socialism, liberalism, republicanism, anarchism, and, nationalism, into, chinese, philosophy, the, most, notable, examples, are, sun, yat, sen, s, three, principles, of, the, people, ideology, and, mao, zedong, s, maoism, a, variant, of, marxism, leninism, in, the, modern, people, s, republic, of, china, the, official, ideology, is, deng, xiaoping, s, market, economy, socialism, although, the, people, s, republic, of, china, has, been, historically, hostile, to, the, philosophy, of, ancient, china, the, influences, of, past, are, still, deeply, ingrained, in, the, chinese, culture, in, the, post, chinese, economic, reform, era, modern, chinese, philosophy, has, reappeared, in, forms, such, as, new, confucianism, as, in, japan, philosophy, in, china, has, become, a, melting, pot, of, ideas, it, accepts, new, concepts, while, attempting, also, to, accord, old, beliefs, their, due, chinese, philosophy, still, carries, profound, influence, amongst, the, people, of, east, asia, and, even, southeast, asia, around, 500, bce, after, the, zhou, state, weakened, and, china, moved, into, the, spring, and, autumn, period, the, classic, period, of, chinese, philosophy, began, this, is, known, as, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, zh, z, b, iji, various, scholars, hundred, schools, this, period, is, considered, the, golden, age, of, chinese, philosophy, of, the, many, schools, founded, at, this, time, and, during, the, subsequent, warring, states, period, the, four, most, influential, ones, were, confucianism, daoism, often, spelled, taoism, mohism, and, legalism, confucianism, is, a, philosophical, school, developed, from, the, teachings, of, confucius, collected, and, written, by, his, disciples, after, his, death, in, the, analects, and, in, the, warring, states, period, mencius, in, the, mencius, and, xunzi, in, the, xunzi, it, is, a, system, of, moral, social, political, and, religious, thought, that, has, had, tremendous, influence, on, chinese, history, thought, and, culture, down, to, the, 20th, century, some, westerners, have, considered, it, to, have, been, the, state, religion, of, imperial, china, because, of, its, lasting, influence, on, asian, culture, its, influence, also, spread, to, korea, japan, vietnam, and, many, other, asian, countries, confucianism, reached, its, peak, of, influence, during, the, tang, and, song, dynasties, under, a, rebranded, confucianism, called, neo, confucianism, confucius, expanded, on, the, already, present, ideas, of, chinese, religion, and, culture, to, reflect, the, time, period, and, environment, of, political, chaos, during, the, warring, states, period, because, confucius, embedded, the, chinese, culture, so, heavily, into, his, philosophy, it, was, able, to, resonate, with, the, people, of, china, this, high, approval, of, confucianism, can, be, seen, through, the, reverence, of, confucius, in, modern, day, china, the, major, confucian, concepts, include, filial, piety, loyalty, zh, ng, li, ritual, ren, humanity, or, humaneness, the, rectification, of, names, i, e, to, ensure, everything, is, what, its, name, implies, it, should, be, confucius, taught, both, positive, and, negative, versions, of, the, golden, rule, the, concepts, yin, and, yang, represent, two, opposing, forces, that, are, permanently, in, conflict, with, each, other, leading, to, perpetual, contradiction, and, change, the, confucian, idea, of, rid, of, the, two, ends, take, the, middle, is, a, chinese, equivalent, of, the, idea, of, thesis, antithesis, and, synthesis, often, attributed, to, hegel, which, is, a, way, of, reconciling, opposites, arriving, at, some, middle, ground, combining, the, best, of, both, confucius, heavily, emphasized, the, idea, of, microcosms, in, society, subunits, of, family, and, community, success, s, were, the, foundations, for, a, successful, state, or, country, confucius, believed, in, the, use, of, education, to, further, knowledge, the, people, in, ethics, societal, behavior, and, reverence, in, other, humans, with, the, combination, of, education, successful, family, and, his, ethical, teachings, he, believed, he, could, govern, a, well, established, society, in, china, taoism, arose, as, a, philosophy, and, later, also, developed, into, a, religion, based, on, the, texts, the, tao, te, ching, ascribed, to, laozi, and, the, zhuangzi, partly, ascribed, to, zhuang, zhou, the, word, tao, also, transliterated, as, dao, literally, means, path, or, way, however, in, taoism, it, refers, more, often, to, a, meta, physical, force, that, encompasses, the, entire, universe, but, which, cannot, be, described, nor, felt, all, major, chinese, philosophical, schools, have, investigated, the, correct, way, to, go, about, a, moral, life, but, in, taoism, it, takes, on, the, most, abstract, meanings, leading, this, school, to, be, named, after, it, it, advocated, nonaction, wu, wei, the, strength, of, softness, spontaneity, and, relativism, although, it, serves, as, a, rival, to, confucianism, a, school, of, active, morality, this, rivalry, is, compromised, and, given, perspective, by, the, idiom, practice, confucianism, on, the, outside, taoism, on, the, inside, most, of, taoism, s, focus, is, on, the, notion, that, human, attempts, to, make, the, world, better, actually, make,

some, as, the, intrastate, realpolitik, of, the, warring, states, period, was, highly, progressive, and, extremely, critical, of, the, confucian, and, mohist, schools, but, that, of, the, qin,

his, theory, attempted, to, explain, the, universe, in, terms, of, basic, forces, in, nature, the, complementary, agents, of, yin, dark, cold, female, negative, and, yang, light, hot, male, positive, and, the, five, elements, or, five, phases, water, fire, wood, metal, and, earth, in, its, early, days, this, theory, was, most, strongly, associated, with, the, states, of, yan, and, qi, in, later, periods, these, epistemological, theories, came, to, hold, significance, in, both, philosophy, and, popular, belief, this, school, was, absorbed, into, taoism, s, alchemic, and, magical, dimensions, as, well, as, into, the, chinese, medical, framework, the, earliest, surviving, recordings, of, this, are, in, the, mawangdui, texts, and, huangdi, neijing, mohism, moism, founded, by, mozi, promotes, universal, love, with, the, aim, of, mutual, benefit, everyone, must, love, each, other, equally, and, impartially, to, avoid, conflict, and, war, mozi, was, strongly, against, confucian, ritual,

peasant, utopian, communalism, and, egalitarianism, the, philosophy, is, founded, on, the, notion, that, human, society, originates, with, the, development, of, agriculture, and, societies, are, based, upon, people, s, natural, propensity, to, farm, the, agriculturalists, believed, that, the, ideal, government, modeled, after, the, semi, mythical, governance, of, shennong, is, led, by, a, benevolent, king, one, who, works, alongside, the, people, in, tilling, the, fields, the, agriculturalist, king, is, not, paid, by, the, government, through, its, treasuries, his, livelihood, is, derived, from, the, profits, he, earns, working, in, the, fields, not, his, leadership, unlike, the, confucians, the, agriculturalists, did, not, believe, in, the, division, of, labour, arguing, instead, that, the, economic, policies, of, a, country, need, to, be, based, upon, an, egalitarian, self, sufficiency, the, agriculturalists, supported, the, fixing, of, prices, in, which, all, similar, goods, regardless, of, differences, in, quality, and, demand, are, set, at, exactly, the, same, unchanging, price, the, short, founder, qin, dynasty, where, legalism, was, the, official, philosophy, quashed, mohist, and, confucianist, schools, legalism, remained, influential, during, the, early, han, dynasty, under, the, taoist, realist, ideology, huang, lao, until, emperor, wu, of, han, adopted, confucianism, as, official, doctrine, confucianism, and, taoism, became, the, determining, forces, of, chinese, thought, until, the, introduction, of, buddhism, confucianism, was, particularly, strong, during, the, han, dynasty, whose, greatest, thinker, was, dong, zhongshu, who, integrated, confucianism, with, the, thoughts, of, the, zhongshu, school, and, the, theory, of, the, five, elements, he, also, was, a, promoter, of, the, new, text, school, which, considered, confucius, as, a, divine, figure, and, a, spiritual, ruler, of, china, who, foresaw, and, started, the, evolution, of, the, world, towards, the, universal, peace, in, contrast, there, was, an, old, text, school, that, advocated, the, use, of, confucian, works, written, in, ancient, language, from, this, comes, the, denomination, old, text, that, were, so, much, more, reliable, in, particular, they, refuted, the, assumption, of, confucius, as, a, godlike, figure, and, considered, him, as, the, greatest, sage, but, simply, a, human, and, mortal, the, 3rd, and, 4th, centuries, saw, the, rise, of, the, xuanxue, mysterious, learning, also, called, neo, taoism, buddhism, arrived, in, china, around, the, 1st, century, ad, but, it, was, not, until, the, northern, and, southern, sui, and, tang, dynasties, that, it, gained, considerable, influence, and, acknowledgement, at, the, beginning, it, was, considered, a, sort, of, taoist, sect, mahayana, buddhism, was, far, more, successful, in, china, than, its, rival, hinayana, and, both, indian, schools, and, local, chinese, sects, arose, from, the, 5th, century, two, chiefly, important, monk, philosophers, were, sengzhao, and, daosheng, but, probably, the, most, influential, and, original, of, these, schools, was, the, chan, sect, which, had, an, even, stronger, impact, in, japan, as, the, zen, sect, in, the, mid, tang, buddhism, reached, its, peak, and, reportedly, there, were, 4, 600, monasteries, 40, 000, hermitages, and, 260, 500, monks, and, nuns, the, power, of, the, buddhist, clergy, was, so, great, and, the, wealth, of, the, monasteries, so, impressive, that, it, instigated, criticism, from, confucian, scholars, who, considered, buddhism, as, a, foreign, religion, in, 845, emperor, wuzong, ordered, the, great, anti, buddhist, persecution, confiscating, the, riches, and, returning, monks, and, nuns, to, lay, life, from, then, on, buddhism, lost, much, of, its, influence, xuanxue, was, a, philosophical, school, that, combined, elements, of, confucianism, and, taoism, to, reinterpret, the, i, ching, tao, te, ching, and, zhuangzi, the, most, important, philosophers, of, this, movement, were, wang, bi, xiang, xiu, and, guo, xiang, the, main, question, of, this, school, was, whether, being, came, before, not, being, in, chinese, ming, and, wuming, a, peculiar, feature, of, these, taoist, thinkers, like, the, seven, sages, of, the, bamboo, grove, was, the, concept, of, feng, liu, lit, wind, and, flow, a, sort, of, romantic, spirit, which, encouraged, following, the, natural, and, instinctive, impulse, buddhism, is, a, religion, a, practical, philosophy, and, arguably, a, psychology, focusing, on, the, teachings, of, gautama, buddha, who, lived, on, the, indian, subcontinent, most, likely, from, the, mid, 6th, to, the, early, 5th, century, bce, when, used, in, a, generic, sense, a, buddha, is, generally, considered, to, be, someone, who, discovers, the, true, nature, of, reality, buddhism, until, the, 4th, century, ad, had, little, impact, on, china, but, in, the, 4th, century, its, teachings, hybridized, with, those, of, taoism, buddhism, brought, to, china, the, idea, of, many, hells, where, sinners, went, but, the, deceased, sinners, souls, could, be, saved, by, pious, acts, since, chinese, traditional, thought, focused, more, on, ethics, rather, than, metaphysics, the, merging, of, buddhist, and, taoist, concepts, developed, several, schools, distinct, from, the, originating, indian, schools, the, most, prominent, examples, with, philosophical, merit, are, sanlun, tiantai, huayan, and, chan, a, k, a, zen, they, investigate, consciousness, levels, of, truth, whether, reality, is, ultimately, empty, and, how, enlightenment, is, to, be, achieved, buddhism, has, a, spiritual, aspect, that, complements, the, action, of, neo, confucianism, with, prominent, neo, confucians, advocating, certain, forms, of, meditation, neo, confucianism, was, a, revived, version, of, old, confucian, principles, that, appeared, around, the, song, dynasty, with, buddhist, taoist, and, legalist, features, the, first, philosophers, such, as, shao, yong, zhou, dunyi, and, chang, zai, were, cosmologists, and, worked, on, the, i, ching, the, cheng, brothers, cheng, yi, and, cheng, hao, are, considered, the, founders, of, the, two, main, schools, of, thought, of, neo, confucianism, the, school, of, principle, the, first, the, school, of, mind, the, latter, the, school, of, principle, gained, supremacy, during, the, song, dynasty, with, the, philosophical, system, elaborated, by, zhu, xi, which, became, mainstream, and, officially, adopted, by, the, government, for, the, imperial, examinations, under, the, yuan, dynasty, the, school, of, mind, was, developed, by, lu, jiuyuan, zhu, xi, s, main, rival, but, was, soon, forgotten, only, during, the, ming, dynasty, was, the, school, of, mind, revived, by, wang, shouren, whose, influence, is, equal, to, that, of, zhu, xi, this, school, was, particularly, important, in, japan, during, the, qing, dynasty, many, philosophers, objected, against, neo, confucianism, and, there, was, a, return, to, the, han, dynasty, confucianism, and, also, the, reprise, of, the, controversy, between, old, text, and, new, text, in, this, period, also, started, the, penetration, of, western, culture, but, most, chinese, thought, that, the, westerners, were, maybe, more, advanced, in, technology, and, warfare, but, that, china, had, primacy, in, moral, and, intellectual, fields, chinese, culture, was, highly, influential, on, the, traditions, of, other, east, asian, states, and, its, philosophy, directly, influenced, korean, philosophy, vietnamese, philosophy, and, japanese, philosophy, during, later, chinese, dynasties, like, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, as, well, as, in, the, korean, joseon, dynasty, 1392, 1897, a, resurgent, neo, confucianism, led, by, thinkers, such, as, wang, yangming, 1472, 1529, became, the, dominant, school, of, thought, and, was, promoted, by, the, imperial, state, in, japan, the, tokugawa, shogunate, 1603, 1867, was, also, strongly, influenced, by, confucian, philosophy, despite, confucianism, losing, popularity, to, taoism, and, buddhism, neo, confucianism, combined, those, ideas, into, a, more, metaphysical, framework, its, concepts, include, li, principle, akin, to, plato, s, forms, qi, vital, or, material, force, taiji, the, great, ultimate, and, xin, mind, song, dynasty, philosopher, zhou, dunyi, 1017, 1073, is, commonly, seen, as, the, first, true, pioneer, of, neo, confucianism, using, daoist, metaphysics, as, a, framework, for, his, ethical, philosophy, neo, confucianism, developed, both, as, a, renaissance, of, traditional, confucian, ideas, and, as, a, reaction, to, the, ideas, of, buddhism, and, religious, daoism, although, the, neo, confucianists, denounced, buddhist, metaphysics, neo, confucianism, did, borrow, daoist, and, buddhist, terminology, and, concepts, neo, confucianist, philosophers, like, zhu, xi, and, wang, yangming, are, seen, as, the, most, important, figures, of, neo, confucianism, during, the, industrial, and, modern, ages, chinese, philosophy, had, also, begun, to, integrate, concepts, of, western, philosophy, as, steps, toward, modernization, chinese, philosophy, never, developed, the, concept, of, human, rights, so, that, classical, chinese, lacked, words, for, them, in, 1864, w, a, p, martin, had, to, invent, the, word, quanli, chinese, to, translate, the, western, concept, of, rights, in, the, process, of, translating, henry, wheaton, s, elements, of, international, law, into, classical, chinese, by, the, time, of, the, xinhai, revolution, in, 1911, there, were, many, calls, such, as, the, may, fourth, movement, to, completely, abolish, the, old, imperial, institutions, and, practices, of, china, there, have, been, attempts, to, incorporate, democracy, republicanism, and, industrialism, into, chinese, philosophy, notably, by, sun, yat, sen, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, mao, zedong, added, marxism, stalinism, chinese, marxist, philosophy, and, other, communist, thought, when, the, chinese, communist, party, took, over, the, reign, previous, schools, of, thought, excepting, notably, legalism, were, denounced, as, backward, and, later, even, purged, during, the, cultural, revolution, whereas, their, influences, on, chinese, thoughts, remain, until, today, the, current, government, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, is, trying, to, encourage, a, form, of, market, socialism, since, the, radical, movement, of, the, cultural, revolution, the, chinese, government, has, become, much, more, tolerant, with, the, practice, of, traditional, beliefs, the, 1978, constitution, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, guarantees, freedom, of,
