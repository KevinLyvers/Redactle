mesopotamian, religion, refers, to, the, religious, beliefs, concerning, the, gods, creation, and, the, cosmos, the, origin, of, man, and, so, forth, and, practices, of, the, civilizations, of, ancient, mesopotamia, particularly, sumer, akkad, assyria, and, babylonia, between, circa, 6000, bc, and, 400, ad, the, religious, development, of, mesopotamia, and, mesopotamian, culture, in, general, especially, in, the, south, were, not, particularly, influenced, by, the, movements, of, the, various, peoples, into, and, throughout, the, area, rather, mesopotamian, religion, was, a, consistent, and, coherent, tradition, which, adapted, to, the, internal, needs, of, its, adherents, over, millennia, of, development, the, earliest, undercurrents, of, mesopotamian, religious, thought, are, believed, to, have, developed, in, mesopotamia, in, the, 6th, millennium, bc, coinciding, with, when, the, region, began, to, be, permanently, settled, the, earliest, evidence, of, mesopotamian, religion, dates, to, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, coincides, with, the, invention, of, writing, and, involved, the, worship, of, forces, of, nature, as, providers, of, sustenance, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, objects, of, worship, were, personified, and, became, an, expansive, cast, of, divinities, with, particular, functions, the, last, stages, of, mesopotamian, polytheism, which, developed, in, the, 2nd, and, 1st, millennia, bc, introduced, greater, emphasis, on, personal, religion, and, structured, the, gods, into, a, monarchical, hierarchy, with, the, national, god, being, the, head, of, the, pantheon, mesopotamian, religion, finally, declined, with, the, spread, of, iranian, religions, during, the, achaemenid, empire, and, with, the, christianization, of, mesopotamia, the, very, earliest, undercurrents, of, mesopotamian, religious, thought, are, believed, to, have, developed, in, the, first, half, of, the, sixth, millennium, bc, at, the, time, people, first, began, to, permanently, settle, in, mesopotamia, owing, to, improved, irrigation, the, early, religious, developments, of, the, region, are, unknown, since, they, preceded, the, invention, of, writing, the, first, evidence, for, what, is, recognisably, mesopotamian, religion, can, be, seen, with, the, invention, in, mesopotamia, of, writing, circa, 3500, bc, the, people, of, mesopotamia, originally, consisted, of, two, groups, east, semitic, speakers, of, akkadian, and, the, people, of, sumer, who, spoke, sumerian, a, language, isolate, these, peoples, were, members, of, various, city, states, and, small, kingdoms, the, sumerians, left, the, first, records, and, are, believed, to, have, been, the, founders, of, the, civilization, of, the, ubaid, period, 6500, bc, to, 3800, bc, in, upper, mesopotamia, by, historical, times, they, resided, in, southern, mesopotamia, which, was, known, as, sumer, and, much, later, babylonia, and, had, considerable, influence, on, the, akkadian, speakers, and, their, culture, akkadian, speakers, are, believed, to, have, entered, the, region, at, some, point, between, 3500, bc, and, 3000, bc, with, akkadian, names, first, appearing, in, the, regnal, lists, of, these, states, c, 29th, century, bc, the, sumerians, were, advanced, as, well, as, inventing, writing, they, developed, early, forms, of, mathematics, early, wheeled, vehicles, chariots, astronomy, astrology, written, code, of, law, organised, medicine, advanced, agriculture, and, architecture, and, the, calendar, they, created, the, first, city, states, such, as, uruk, ur, lagash, isin, kish, umma, eridu, adab, akshak, sippar, nippur, and, larsa, each, of, them, ruled, by, an, ens, the, sumerians, remained, largely, dominant, in, this, synthesised, culture, however, until, the, rise, of, the, akkadian, empire, under, sargon, of, akkad, circa, 2335, bc, which, united, all, of, mesopotamia, under, one, ruler, there, was, increasing, syncretism, between, the, sumerian, and, akkadian, cultures, and, deities, with, the, akkadians, typically, preferring, to, worship, fewer, deities, but, elevating, them, to, greater, positions, of, power, like, many, nations, in, mesopotamian, history, assyria, was, originally, to, a, great, extent, an, oligarchy, rather, than, a, monarchy, authority, was, considered, to, lie, with, the, city, and, the, polity, had, three, main, centres, of, power, an, assembly, of, elders, a, hereditary, ruler, and, an, eponym, the, ruler, presided, over, the, assembly, and, carried, out, its, decisions, he, was, not, referred, to, with, the, usual, akkadian, term, for, king, arrum, that, was, instead, reserved, for, the, city, s, patron, deity, ashur, of, whom, the, ruler, was, the, high, priest, the, ruler, himself, was, only, designated, as, steward, of, assur, i, iak, assur, where, the, term, for, steward, is, a, borrowing, from, sumerian, ens, the, third, centre, of, power, was, the, eponym, limmum, who, gave, the, year, his, name, similarly, to, the, eponymous, archon, and, roman, consuls, of, classical, antiquity, he, was, annually, elected, by, lot, and, was, responsible, for, the, economic, administration, of, the, city, which, included, the, power, to, detain, people, and, confiscate, property, the, institution, of, the, eponym, as, well, as, the, formula, i, iak, assur, lingered, on, as, ceremonial, vestiges, of, this, early, system, throughout, the, history, of, the, assyrian, monarchy, the, religion, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, centered, around, the, assyrian, king, as, the, king, of, their, lands, as, well, however, kingship, at, the, time, was, linked, very, closely, with, the, idea, of, divine, mandate, the, assyrian, king, while, not, being, a, god, himself, was, acknowledged, as, the, chief, servant, of, the, chief, god, ashur, in, this, manner, the, king, s, authority, was, seen, as, absolute, so, long, as, the, high, priest, reassured, the, peoples, that, the, gods, or, in, the, case, of, the, henotheistic, assyrians, the, god, was, pleased, with, the, current, ruler, for, the, assyrians, who, lived, in, assur, and, the, surrounding, lands, this, system, was, the, norm, for, the, conquered, peoples, however, it, was, novel, particularly, to, the, people, of, smaller, city, states, in, time, ashur, was, promoted, from, being, the, local, deity, of, assur, to, the, overlord, of, the, vast, assyrian, domain, which, spread, from, the, caucasus, and, armenia, in, the, north, to, egypt, nubia, and, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, south, and, from, cyprus, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, sea, in, the, west, to, central, iran, in, the, east, assur, the, patron, deity, of, the, city, of, assur, from, the, late, bronze, age, was, in, constant, rivalry, with, the, patron, deity, of, babylon, marduk, worship, was, conducted, in, his, name, throughout, the, lands, dominated, by, the, assyrians, with, the, worship, of, assur, across, much, of, the, fertile, crescent, the, assyrian, king, could, command, the, loyalty, of, his, fellow, servants, of, assur, in, 539, bc, mesopotamia, was, conquered, by, the, achaemenid, empire, 539, 332, bc, then, ruled, by, cyrus, the, great, this, brought, to, an, end, over, 3000, years, of, mesopotamian, dominance, of, the, near, east, the, persians, maintained, and, did, not, interfere, in, the, native, culture, and, religion, and, assyria, and, babylon, continued, to, exist, as, entities, although, chaldea, and, the, chaldeans, disappeared, and, assyria, was, strong, enough, to, launch, major, rebellions, against, the, achaemenids, in, 522, and, 482, bc, during, this, period, the, syriac, language, and, syriac, alphabet, evolved, in, assyria, among, the, assyrian, people, and, were, centuries, later, to, be, the, vehicle, for, the, spread, of, syriac, christianity, throughout, the, near, east, then, two, centuries, later, in, 330, bc, the, macedonian, emperor, alexander, the, great, overthrew, the, persians, and, took, control, of, mesopotamia, itself, after, alexander, s, death, increased, hellenistic, influence, was, brought, to, the, region, by, the, seleucid, empire, assyria, and, babylonia, later, became, provinces, under, the, parthian, empire, achaemenid, assyria, and, province, of, babylonia, rome, province, of, assyria, and, sasanian, empire, province, of, asoristan, babylonia, was, dissolved, as, an, entity, during, the, parthian, empire, though, assyria, endured, as, a, geopolitical, entity, until, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, while, the, assyrians, are, still, present, today, during, the, parthian, empire, there, was, a, major, revival, in, assyria, between, the, second, century, bc, and, fourth, century, ad, with, temples, once, more, being, dedicated, to, gods, such, as, assur, sin, shamash, hadad, and, ishtar, in, various, parthian, vassal, states, in, mesopotamia, in, the, third, century, ad, manichaeism, which, incorporated, elements, of, christianity, judaism, buddhism, zoroastrianism, and, local, mesopotamian, religion, developed, with, the, exception, of, the, enuma, elish, there, are, no, surviving, records, that, systematically, explain, mesopotamian, cosmology, nonetheless, modern, scholars, have, reconstructed, a, roughly, accurate, depiction, from, the, surviving, evidence, including, sumerian, and, akkadian, cuneiform, and, the, hebrew, bible, in, the, enuma, elish, ca, 12th, century, bc, the, god, marduk, kills, tiamat, the, mother, of, the, gods, and, from, the, two, halves, of, her, carcass, constructs, the, heavens, and, the, earth, to, shape, the, modern, observable, cosmos, a, document, from, a, similar, period, stated, that, the, heavens, and, the, earth, can, each, be, divided, into, three, layers, the, gods, dwell, in, the, higher, levels, of, heaven, with, the, stars, being, fixed, into, the, lowermost, heavenly, layer, mesopotamian, religion, was, polytheistic, thereby, accepting, the, existence, of, many, different, deities, both, male, and, female, though, it, was, also, henotheistic, with, certain, gods, being, viewed, as, superior, to, others, by, their, specific, devotees, these, devotees, were, often, from, a, particular, city, or, city, state, that, held, that, deity, as, its, tutelary, deity, for, instance, enki, was, often, associated, with, the, city, of, eridu, in, sumer, assur, with, assur, and, assyria, enlil, with, the, sumerian, city, of, nippur, ishtar, with, the, assyrian, city, of, arbela, and, the, god, marduk, with, babylon, though, the, full, number, of, gods, and, goddesses, found, in, mesopotamia, is, not, known, k, tallqvist, in, his, akkadische, g, tterepitheta, 1938, counted, around, 2, 400, that, scholars, know, most, of, which, had, sumerian, names, in, the, sumerian, language, the, gods, were, referred, to, as, dingir, while, in, the, akkadian, language, they, were, known, as, ilu, and, it, seems, that, there, was, syncretism, between, the, gods, worshipped, by, the, two, groups, adopting, one, another, s, deities, the, mesopotamian, gods, bore, many, similarities, with, humans, and, were, anthropomorphic, thereby, having, humanoid, form, similarly, they, often, acted, like, humans, requiring, food, and, drink, as, well, as, drinking, alcohol, and, subsequently, suffering, the, effects, of, drunkenness, but, were, thought, to, have, a, higher, degree, of, perfection, than, common, men, they, were, thought, to, be, more, powerful, all, seeing, and, all, knowing, unfathomable, and, above, all, immortal, one, of, their, prominent, features, was, a, terrifying, brightness, melammu, which, surrounded, them, producing, an, immediate, reaction, of, awe, and, reverence, among, men, in, many, cases, the, various, deities, were, family, relations, of, one, another, a, trait, found, in, many, other, polytheistic, religions, the, historian, j, bott, ro, was, of, the, opinion, that, the, gods, were, not, viewed, mystically, but, were, instead, seen, as, high, up, masters, who, had, to, be, obeyed, and, feared, as, opposed, to, loved, and, adored, nonetheless, many, mesopotamians, of, all, classes, often, had, names, that, were, devoted, to, a, certain, deity, this, practice, appeared, to, have, begun, in, the, third, millennium, bc, among, the, sumerians, but, also, was, later, adopted, by, the, akkadians, assyrians, and, babylonians, as, well, initially, the, pantheon, was, not, ordered, but, later, mesopotamian, theologians, came, up, with, the, concept, of, ranking, the, deities, in, order, of, importance, a, sumerian, list, of, around, 560, deities, that, did, this, was, uncovered, at, farm, and, tell, ab, al, b, kh, and, dated, to, circa, 2600, bc, ranking, five, primary, deities, as, being, of, particular, importance, one, of, the, most, important, of, these, early, mesopotamian, deities, was, the, god, enlil, who, was, originally, a, sumerian, divinity, viewed, as, a, king, of, the, gods, and, a, controller, of, the, world, who, was, later, adopted, by, the, akkadians, another, was, the, sumerian, god, an, who, served, a, similar, role, to, enlil, and, became, known, as, anu, among, the, akkadians, the, sumerian, god, enki, was, later, also, adopted, by, the, akkadians, initially, under, his, original, name, and, later, as, a, similarly, the, sumerian, moon, god, nanna, became, the, akkadian, s, n, while, the, sumerian, sun, god, utu, became, the, akkadian, shamash, one, of, the, most, notable, goddesses, was, the, sumerian, sex, and, war, deity, inanna, with, the, later, rise, to, power, of, the, babylonians, in, the, 18th, century, bc, the, king, hammurabi, declared, marduk, a, deity, who, before, then, had, not, been, of, significant, importance, to, a, position, of, supremacy, alongside, anu, and, enlil, in, southern, mesopotamia, although, marduk, may, have, been, modelled, after, the, sumerian, storm, god, ninurta, whose, exploits, share, great, similarity, perhaps, the, most, significant, legend, to, survive, from, mesopotamian, religion, is, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, which, tells, the, story, of, the, heroic, king, gilgamesh, and, his, wild, friend, enkidu, and, the, former, s, search, for, immortality, which, is, entwined, with, all, the, gods, and, their, approval, it, also, contains, the, earliest, reference, to, the, great, flood, akkadian, religion, sometimes, took, inspiration, from, influential, sumerian, religious, leaders, and, beliefs, and, deified, sumerian, kings, at, some, points, enlil, his, authority, is, far, reaching, his, word, is, sublime, and, holy, his, decisions, are, unalterable, he, decides, fate, forever, his, eyes, scrutinize, the, entire, world, a, prayer, to, the, god, enlil, each, mesopotamian, city, was, home, to, a, deity, and, each, of, the, prominent, deities, was, the, patron, of, a, city, and, all, known, temples, were, located, in, cities, though, there, may, have, been, shrines, in, the, suburbs, the, temple, itself, was, constructed, of, mud, brick, in, the, form, of, a, ziggurat, which, rose, to, the, sky, in, a, series, of, stairstep, stages, its, significance, and, symbolism, have, been, the, subject, of, much, discussion, but, most, regard, the, tower, as, a, kind, of, staircase, or, ladder, for, the, god, to, descend, from, and, ascend, to, the, heavens, though, there, are, signs, which, point, towards, an, actual, cult, having, been, practiced, in, the, upper, temple, so, the, entire, temple, may, have, been, regarded, as, a, giant, altar, other, theories, treat, the, tower, as, an, image, of, the, cosmic, mountain, where, a, dying, and, rising, god, lay, buried, some, temples, such, as, the, temple, of, enki, in, eridu, contained, a, holy, tree, kiskanu, in, a, holy, grove, which, was, the, central, point, of, various, rites, performed, by, the, king, who, functioned, as, a, master, gardener, mesopotamian, temples, were, originally, built, to, serve, as, dwelling, places, for, the, god, who, was, thought, to, reside, and, hold, court, on, earth, for, the, good, of, the, city, and, kingdom, his, presence, was, symbolized, by, an, image, of, the, god, in, a, separate, room, the, god, s, presence, within, the, image, seems, to, have, been, thought, of, in, a, very, concrete, way, as, instruments, for, the, presence, of, the, deity, this, is, evident, from, the, poem, how, erra, wrecked, the, world, in, which, erra, deceived, the, god, marduk, into, leaving, his, cult, statue, once, constructed, idols, were, consecrated, through, special, nocturnal, rituals, where, they, were, given, life, and, their, mouth, was, opened, pet, p, and, washed, mes, p, so, they, could, see, and, eat, if, the, deity, approved, it, would, accept, the, image, and, agree, to, inhabit, it, these, images, were, also, entertained, and, sometime, escorted, on, hunting, expeditions, in, order, to, service, the, gods, the, temple, was, equipped, with, a, household, with, kitchens, and, kitchenware, sleeping, rooms, with, beds, and, side, rooms, for, the, deity, s, family, as, well, as, a, courtyard, with, a, basin, and, water, for, cleansing, visitors, as, well, as, a, stable, for, the, god, s, chariot, and, draft, animals, generally, the, god, s, well, being, was, maintained, through, service, or, work, dullu, the, image, was, dressed, and, served, banquets, twice, a, day, it, is, not, known, how, the, god, was, thought, to, consume, the, food, but, a, curtain, was, drawn, before, the, table, while, he, or, she, ate, just, as, the, king, himself, was, not, allowed, to, be, seen, by, the, masses, while, he, ate, occasionally, the, king, shared, in, these, meals, and, the, priests, may, have, had, some, share, in, the, offerings, as, well, incense, was, also, burned, before, the, image, because, it, was, thought, that, the, gods, enjoyed, the, smell, sacrificial, meals, were, also, set, out, regularly, with, a, sacrificial, animal, seen, as, a, replacement, p, hu, or, substitute, din, nu, for, a, man, and, it, was, considered, that, the, anger, of, the, gods, or, demons, was, then, directed, towards, the, sacrificial, animal, additionally, certain, days, required, extra, sacrifices, and, ceremonies, for, certain, gods, and, every, day, was, sacred, to, a, particular, god, the, king, was, thought, in, theory, to, be, the, religious, leader, enu, or, ang, of, the, cult, and, exercised, a, large, number, of, duties, within, the, temple, with, a, large, number, of, specialists, whose, task, was, to, mediate, between, men, and, gods, a, supervising, or, watchman, priest, e, gallu, priests, for, individual, purification, against, demons, and,

also, paid, homage, to, a, personal, deity, as, with, other, deities, the, personal, gods, changed, over, time, and, little, is, known, about, early, practice, as, they, are, rarely, named, or, described, in, the, mid, third, millennium, bc, some, rulers, regarded, a, particular, god, or, gods, as, being, their, personal, protector, in, the, second, millennium, bc, personal, gods, began, to, function, more, on, behalf, of, the, common, man, with, whom, he, had, a, close, personal, relationship, maintained, through, prayer, and, maintenance, of, his, god, s, statue, a, number, of, written, prayers, have, survived, from, ancient, mesopotamia, each, of, which, typically, exalt, the, god, that, they, are, describing, above, all, others, the, historian, j, bott, ro, stated, that, these, poems, display, extreme, reverence, profound, devotion, the, unarguable, emotion, that, the, supernatural, evoked, in, the, hearts, of, those, ancient, believers, but, that, they, showed, a, people, who, were, scared, of, their, gods, rather, than, openly, celebrating, them, they, were, thought, to, offer, good, luck, success, and, protection, from, disease, and, demons, and, one, s, place, and, success, in, society, was, thought, to, depend, on, his, personal, deity, including, the, development, of, his, certain, talents, and, even, his, personality, this, was, even, taken, to, the, point, that, everything, he, experienced, was, considered, a, reflection, of, what, was, happening, to, his, personal, god, when, a, man, neglected, his, god, it, was, assumed, that, the, demons, were, free, to, inflict, him, and, when, he, revered, his, god, that, god, was, like, a, shepherd, who, seeks, food, for, him, there, was, a, strong, belief, in, demons, in, mesopotamia, and, private, individuals, like, the, temple, priests, also, participated, in, incantations, iptu, to, ward, them, off, although, there, was, no, collective, term, for, these, beings, either, in, sumerian, or, akkadian, they, were, merely, described, as, harmful, or, dangerous, beings, or, forces, and, they, were, used, as, a, logical, way, to, explain, the, existence, of, evil, in, the, world, they, were, thought, to, be, countless, in, number, and, were, thought, to, even, attack, the, gods, as, well, besides, demons, there, were, also, spirits, of, the, dead, etimmu, who, could, also, cause, mischief, amulets, were, occasionally, used, and, sometimes, a, special, priest, or, exorcist, ipu, or, ma, ma, u, was, required, incantations, and, ceremonies, were, also, used, to, cure, diseases, which, were, also, thought, to, be, associated, with, demonic, activity, sometimes, making, use, of, sympathetic, magic, sometimes, an, attempt, was, made, to, capture, a, demon, by, making, an, image, of, it, placing, it, above, the, head, of, a, sick, person, then, destroying, the, image, which, the, demon, was, somehow, likely, to, inhabit, images, of, protecting, spirits, were, also, made, and, placed, at, gates, to, ward, off, disaster, divination, was, also, employed, by, private, individuals, with, the, assumption, that, the, gods, have, already, determined, the, destinies, of, men, and, these, destinies, could, be, ascertained, through, observing, omens, and, through, rituals, e, g, casting, lots, it, was, believed, that, the, gods, expressed, their, will, through, words, amatu, and, commandments, qibitu, which, were, not, necessarily, spoken, but, were, thought, to, manifest, in, the, unfolding, routine, of, events, and, things, there, were, countless, ways, to, divine, the, future, such, as, observing, oil, dropped, into, a, cup, of, water, lecanomancy, observing, the, entrails, of, sacrificial, animals, extispicy, observation, of, the, behavior, of, birds, augury, and, observing, celestial, and, meteorological, phenomena, astrology, as, well, as, through, interpretation, of, dreams, often, interpretation, of, these, phenomena, required, the, need, for, two, classes, of, priests, askers, sa, ilu, and, observer, baru, and, also, sometimes, a, lower, class, of, ecstatic, seer, mahhu, that, was, also, associated, with, witchcraft, do, not, return, evil,

from, the, urpu, series, although, ancient, paganism, tended, to, focus, more, on, duty, and, ritual, than, morality, a, number, of, general, moral, virtues, can, be, gleaned, from, surviving, prayers, and, myths, it, was, believed, that, man, originated, as, a, divine, act, of, creation, and, the, gods, were, believed, to, be, the, source, of, life, and, held, power, over, sickness, and, health, as, well, as, the, destinies, of, men, personal, names, show, that, each, child, was, considered, a, gift, from, divinity, man, was, believed, to, have, been, created, to, serve, the, gods,

seem, to, have, been, primarily, of, a, cultic, and, ritual, nature, although, some, prayers, express, a, positive, psychological, relationship, or, a, sort, of, conversion, experience, in, regard, to, a, god, generally, the, reward, to, mankind, is, described, as, success, and, long, life, every, man, also, had, duties, to, his, fellow, man, which, had, some, religious, character, particularly, the, king, s, duties, to, his, subjects, it, was, thought, that, one, of, the, reasons, the, gods, gave, power, to, the, king, was, to, exercise, justice, and, righteousness, described, as, m, aru, and, kettu, literally, straightness, rightness, firmness, truth, examples, of, this, include, not, alienating, and, causing, dissension, between, friends, and, relatives, setting, innocent, prisoners, free, being, truthful, being, honest, in, trade, respecting, boundary, lines, and, property, rights, and, not, putting, on, airs, with, subordinates, some, of, these, guidelines, are, found, in, the, second, tablet, of, the, urpu, incantation, series, sin, on, the, other, hand, was, expressed, by, the, words, hitu, mistake, false, step, annu, or, arnu, rebellion, and, qillatu, sin, or, curse, with, strong, emphasis, on, the, idea, of, rebellion, sometimes, with, the, idea, that, sin, is, man, s, wishing, to, live, on, his, own, terms, ina, ramanisu, sin, also, was, described, as, anything, which, incited, the, wrath, of, the, gods, punishment, came, through, sickness, or, misfortune, which, inevitably, lead, to, the, common, reference, to, unknown, sins, or, the, idea, that, one, can, transgress, a, divine, prohibition, without, knowing, it, psalms, of, lamentation, rarely, mention, concrete, sins, this, idea, of, retribution, was, also, applied, to, the, nation, and, history, as, a, whole, a, number, of, examples, of, mesopotamian, literature, show, how, war, and, natural, disasters, were, treated, as, punishment, from, the, gods, and, how, kings, were, used, as, a, tool, for, deliverance, sumerian, myths, suggest, a, prohibition, against, premarital, sex, marriages, were, often, arranged, by, the, parents, of, the, bride, and, groom, engagements, were, usually, completed, through, the, approval, of, contracts, recorded, on, clay, tablets, these, marriages, became, legal, as, soon, as, the, groom, delivered, a, bridal, gift, to, his, bride, s, father, nonetheless, evidence, suggests, that, premarital, sex, was, a, common, but, surreptitious, occurrence, 78, the, worship, of, inanna, ishtar, which, was, prevalent, in, mesopotamia, could, involve, wild, frenzied, dancing, and, bloody, ritual, celebrations, of, social, and, physical, abnormality, it, was, believed, that, nothing, is, prohibited, to, inanna, and, that, by, depicting, transgressions, of, normal, human, social, and, physical, limitations, including, traditional, gender, definition, one, could, cross, over, from, the, conscious, everyday, world, into, the, trance, world, of, spiritual, ecstasy, mesopotamians, believed, in, an, afterlife, that, took, place, in, a, region, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, inhabited, by, living, humans, this, was, the, ancient, mesopotamian, underworld, known, by, many, names, including, arall, ganzer, or, irkallu, great, below, it, was, believed, everyone, went, to, this, region, after, death, irrespective, of, social, status, or, the, actions, performed, during, their, lifetime, unlike, christian, hell, the, mesopotamians, considered, the, underworld, neither, a, punishment, nor, a, reward, nevertheless, the, condition, of, the, dead, was, hardly, considered, the, same, as, the, life, previously, enjoyed, on, earth, they, were, considered, merely, weak, and, powerless, ghosts, the, myth, of, ishtar, s, descent, into, the, underworld, relates, that, dust, is, their, food, and, clay, their, nourishment, they, see, no, light, where, they, dwell, in, darkness, stories, such, as, the, adapa, myth, resignedly, relate, that, due, to, a, blunder, all, men, must, die, and, that, true, everlasting, life, is, the, sole, property, of, the, gods, there, are, no, known, mesopotamian, tales, about, the, end, of, the, world, although, it, has, been, speculated, that, they, believed, that, this, would, eventually, occur, this, is, largely, because, berossus, wrote, that, the, mesopotamians, believed, the, world, to, last, twelve, times, twelve, sars, in, his, babyloniaca, with, a, sar, being, 3, 600, years, this, would, indicate, that, at, least, some, of, the, mesopotamians, believed, that, the, earth, would, only, last, 518, 400, years, berossus, does, not, report, what, was, thought, to, follow, this, event, however, as, with, most, dead, religions, many, aspects, of, the, common, practices, and, intricacies, of, the, doctrine, have, been, lost, and, forgotten, over, time, however, much, of, the, information, and, knowledge, has, survived, and, great, work, has, been, done, by, historians, and, scientists, with, the, help, of, religious, scholars, and, translators, to, re, construct, a, working, knowledge, of, the, religious, history, customs, and, the, role, these, beliefs, played, in, everyday, life, in, sumer, akkad, assyria, babylonia, ebla, and, chaldea, during, this, time, mesopotamian, religion, is, thought, to, have, been, an, influence, on, subsequent, religions, throughout, the, world, including, canaanite, israelite, aramean, and, ancient, greek, mesopotamian, religion, was, polytheistic, worshipping, over, 2, 100, different, deities, many, of, which, were, associated, with, a, specific, state, within, mesopotamia, such, as, sumer, akkad, assyria, or, babylonia, or, a, specific, mesopotamian, city, mesopotamian, religion, has, historically, the, oldest, body, of, recorded, literature, of, any, religious, tradition, what, is, known, about, mesopotamian, religion, comes, from, archaeological, evidence, uncovered, in, the, region, particularly, numerous, literary, sources, which, are, usually, written, in, sumerian, akkadian, assyro, babylonian, or, aramaic, using, cuneiform, script, on, clay, tablets, and, which, describe, both, mythology, and, cultic, practices, other, artifacts, can, also, be, useful, when, reconstructing, mesopotamian, religion, as, is, common, with, most, ancient, civilizations, the, objects, made, of, the, most, durable, and, precious, materials, and, thus, more, likely, to, survive, were, associated, with, religious, beliefs, and, practices, this, has, prompted, one, scholar, to, make, the, claim, that, the, mesopotamian, s, entire, existence, was, infused, by, their, religiosity, just, about, everything, they, have, passed, on, to, us, can, be, used, as, a, source, of, knowledge, about, their, religion, the, modern, study, of, mesopotamia, assyriology, is, still, a, fairly, young, science, beginning, only, in, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, study, of, mesopotamian, religion, can, be, a, complex, and, difficult, subject, because, by, nature, their, religion, was, governed, only, by, usage, not, by, any, official, decision, and, by, nature, it, was, neither, dogmatic, nor, systematic, deities, characters, and, their, actions, within, myths, changed, in, character, and, importance, over, time, and, occasionally, depicted, different, sometimes, even, contrasting, images, or, concepts, this, is, further, complicated, by, the, fact, that, scholars, are, not, entirely, certain, what, role, religious, texts, played, in, the, mesopotamian, world, a, number, of, scholars, once, argued, that, defining, a, single, mesopotamian, religion, was, not, possible, and, as, such, a, systematic, exposition, of, mesopotamian, religion, should, not, be, produced, other, have, rebutted, that, this, is, a, mistaken, approach, insofar, as, it, would, fracture, the, study, of, religion, among, social, divisions, such, as, private, religion, religion, of, the, educated, individual, cities, and, provinces, ebla, mari, assyria, and, time, periods, seleucid, achaemenid, etc, and, that, this, fracture, would, be, counterproductive, as, the, succession, of, ancient, near, eastern, states, did, not, impact, the, presence, of, a, broadly, shared, religious, system, across, them, according, to, panbabylonism, a, school, of, thought, founded, by, hugo, winckler, and, held, in, the, early, 20th, century, among, primarily, german, assyriologists, there, was, a, common, cultural, system, extending, over, the, ancient, near, east, which, was, overwhelmingly, influenced, by, the, babylonians, according, to, this, theory, the, religions, of, the, near, east, were, rooted, in, babylonian, astral, science, including, the, hebrew, bible, and, judaism, this, theory, of, a, babylonian, derived, bible, originated, from, the, discovery, of, a, stele, in, the, acropolis, of, susa, bearing, a, babylonian, flood, myth, with, many, similarities, to, the, flood, of, genesis, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, however, flood, myths, appear, in, almost, every, culture, around, the, world, including, cultures, that, never, had, contact, with, mesopotamia, the, fundamental, tenets, of, panbabylonism, were, eventually, dismissed, as, pseudoscientific, however, assyriologists, and, biblical, scholars, recognize, the, influence, of, babylonian, mythology, on, jewish, mythology, and, other, near, eastern, mythologies, albeit, indirect, indeed, similarities, between, both, religious, traditions, may, draw, from, even, older, sources, in, march, 2020, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, a, 5, 000, year, old, cultic, area, filled, with, more, than, 300, broken, ceremonial, ceramic, cups, bowls, jars, animal, bones, and, ritual, processions, dedicated, to, ningirsu, at, the, site, of, girsu, one, of, the, remains, was, a, duck, shaped, bronze, figurine, with, eyes, made, from, bark, which, is, thought, to, be, dedicated, to, nanshe, while, mesopotamian, religion, had, almost, completely, died, out, by, approximately, 400, 500, ce, after, its, indigenous, adherents, had, largely, become, assyrian, christians, it, has, still, had, an, influence, on, the, modern, world, predominantly, because, many, biblical, stories, that, are, today, found, in, judaism, christianity, islam, and, mandaeism, were, possibly, based, upon, earlier, mesopotamian, myths, in, particular, that, of, the, creation, myth, the, garden, of, eden, the, flood, myth, the, tower, of, babel, figures, such, as, nimrod, and, lilith, and, the, book, of, esther, it, has, also, inspired, various, contemporary, neo, pagan, groups, in, the, new, testament, book, of, revelation, babylonian, religion, is, associated, with, religious, apostasy, of, the, lowest, order, the, archetype, of, a, political, religious, system, heavily, tied, to, global, commerce, and, it, is, depicted, as, a, system, which, according, to, the, author, continued, to, hold, sway, in, the, first, century, ce, eventually, to, be, utterly, annihilated, 17, 5, 18, 9, according, to, some, interpretations, this, is, believed, to, refer, to, the, roman, empire, but, according, to, other, interpretations, this, system, remains, extant, in, the, world, until, the, second, coming
