in, the, philosophy, of, mind, mind, body, dualism, denotes, either, the, view, that, mental, phenomena, are, non, physical, or, that, the, mind, and, body, are, distinct, and, separable, thus, it, encompasses, a, set, of, views, about, the, relationship, between, mind, and, matter, as, well, as, between, subject, and, object, and, is, contrasted, with, other, positions, such, as, physicalism, and, enactivism, in, the, mind, body, problem, aristotle, shared, plato, s, view, of, multiple, souls, and, further, elaborated, a, hierarchical, arrangement, corresponding, to, the, distinctive, functions, of, plants, animals, and, humans, a, nutritive, soul, of, growth, and, metabolism, that, all, three, share, a, perceptive, soul, of, pain, pleasure, and, desire, that, only, humans, and, other, animals, share, and, the, faculty, of, reason, that, is, unique, to, humans, only, in, this, view, a, soul, is, the, hylomorphic, form, of, a, viable, organism, wherein, each, level, of, the, hierarchy, formally, supervenes, upon, the, substance, of, the, preceding, level, for, aristotle, the, first, two, souls, based, on, the, body, perish, when, the, living, organism, dies, whereas, there, remains, an, immortal, and, perpetual, intellective, part, of, mind, for, plato, however, the, soul, was, not, dependent, on, the, physical, body, he, believed, in, metempsychosis, the, migration, of, the, soul, to, a, new, physical, body, it, has, been, considered, a, form, of, reductionism, by, some, philosophers, since, it, enables, the, tendency, to, ignore, very, big, groups, of, variables, by, its, assumed, association, with, the, mind, or, the, body, and, not, for, its, real, value, when, it, comes, to, explaining, or, predicting, a, studied, phenomenon, dualism, is, closely, associated, with, the, thought, of, ren, descartes, 1641, who, holds, that, the, mind, is, a, nonphysical, and, therefore, non, spatial, substance, descartes, clearly, identified, the, mind, with, consciousness, and, self, awareness, and, distinguished, this, from, the, physical, brain, as, the, seat, of, intelligence, hence, he, was, the, first, documented, western, philosopher, to, formulate, the, mind, body, problem, in, the, form, in, which, it, exists, today, however, the, theory, of, substance, dualism, has, many, advocates, in, contemporary, philosophy, such, as, richard, swinburne, william, hasker, j, p, morland, e, j, low, charles, taliaferro, seyyed, jaaber, mousavirad, and, john, foster, dualism, is, contrasted, with, various, kinds, of, monism, substance, dualism, is, contrasted, with, all, forms, of, materialism, but, property, dualism, may, be, considered, a, form, of, emergent, materialism, or, non, reductive, physicalism, in, some, sense, ontological, dualism, makes, dual, commitments, about, the, nature, of, existence, as, it, relates, to, mind, and, matter, and, can, be, divided, into, three, different, types, substance, dualism, asserts, that, mind, and, matter, are, fundamentally, distinct, kinds, of, foundations, there, are, several, types, of, substance, dualism, most, substance, dualists, hold, the, view, that, the, mind, and, body, are, capable, of, causally, affecting, each, other, known, as, interactionism, notable, defenders, of, substance, dualism, include, john, foster, stewart, goetz, richard, swinburne, and, charles, taliaferro, cartesian, dualism, most, famously, defended, by, ren, descartes, argues, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, substances, mental, and, physical, descartes, states, that, the, mental, can, exist, outside, of, the, body, and, the, body, cannot, think, substance, dualism, is, important, historically, for, having, given, rise, to, much, thought, regarding, the, famous, mind, body, problem, it, is, compatible, with, theologies, which, claim, that, immortal, souls, occupy, an, independent, realm, of, existence, distinct, from, that, of, the, physical, world, cartesians, tend, to, equate, the, soul, to, the, mind, the, copernican, revolution, and, the, scientific, discoveries, of, the, 17th, century, reinforced, the, belief, that, the, scientific, method, was, the, unique, way, of, knowledge, bodies, were, seen, as, biological, organisms, to, be, studied, in, their, constituent, parts, materialism, by, means, of, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and, physics, reductionism, mind, body, dualism, remained, the, biomedical, paradigm, and, model, for, the, following, three, centuries, thomistic, substance, dualism, has, been, defended, by, j, p, moreland, and, scott, b, rae, thomistic, substance, dualism, distinguishes, itself, from, cartesian, substance, dualism, by, denying, that, the, body, and, soul, are, different, substances, instead, a, person, is, composed, of, only, one, substance, the, soul, whilst, the, body, is, considered, an, ensouled, physical, structure, another, type, of, substance, dualism, has, been, defended, by, william, hasker, called, emergent, dualism, property, dualism, asserts, that, an, ontological, distinction, lies, in, the, differences, between, properties, of, mind, and, matter, and, that, consciousness, may, be, ontologically, irreducible, to, neurobiology, and, physics, it, asserts, that, when, matter, is, organized, in, the, appropriate, way, i, e, in, the, way, that, living, human, bodies, are, organized, mental, properties, emerge, hence, it, is, a, sub, branch, of, emergent, materialism, what, views, properly, fall, under, the, property, dualism, rubric, is, itself, a, matter, of, dispute, there, are, different, versions, of, property, dualism, some, of, which, claim, independent, categorisation, non, reductive, physicalism, is, a, form, of, property, dualism, in, which, it, is, asserted, that, all, mental, states, are, causally, reducible, to, physical, states, one, argument, for, this, has, been, made, in, the, form, of, anomalous, monism, expressed, by, donald, davidson, where, it, is, argued, that, mental, events, are, identical, to, physical, events, however, strict, law, governed, causal, relationships, cannot, describe, relations, of, mental, events, another, argument, for, this, has, been, expressed, by, john, searle, who, is, the, advocate, of, a, distinctive, form, of, physicalism, he, calls, biological, naturalism, his, view, is, that, although, mental, states, are, ontologically, irreducible, to, physical, states, they, are, causally, reducible, he, has, acknowledged, that, to, many, people, his, views, and, those, of, property, dualists, look, a, lot, alike, but, he, thinks, the, comparison, is, misleading, non, reductive, physicalism, is, the, idea, that, while, there, is, one, kind, of, substance, physical, it, has, two, kinds, of, properties, mental, and, physical, mental, properties, aren, t, reducible, to, physical, properties, in, that, an, ontological, distinction, lies, in, the, differences, between, the, properties, of, mind, and, matter, according, to, non, reductive, physicalism, all, mental, states, may, be, causally, reducible, to, physical, states, where, mental, properties, map, to, physical, properties, and, vice, versa, a, prominent, form, of, non, reductive, physicalism, called, anomalous, monism, was, first, proposed, by, donald, davidson, in, his, 1970, paper, mental, events, in, which, he, claims, that, mental, events, are, identical, with, physical, events, and, that, the, mental, is, anomalous, i, e, under, their, mental, descriptions, these, mental, events, are, not, regulated, by, strict, physical, laws, epiphenomenalism, is, a, form, of, property, dualism, in, which, it, is, asserted, that, one, or, more, mental, states, do, not, have, any, influence, on, physical, states, both, ontologically, and, causally, irreducible, it, asserts, that, while, material, causes, give, rise, to, sensations, volitions, ideas, etc, such, mental, phenomena, themselves, cause, nothing, further, they, are, causal, dead, ends, this, can, be, contrasted, to, interactionism, on, the, other, hand, in, which, mental, causes, can, produce, material, effects, and, vice, versa, predicate, dualism, is, a, view, espoused, by, such, non, reductive, physicalists, as, donald, davidson, and, jerry, fodor, who, maintain, that, while, there, is, only, one, ontological, category, of, substances, and, properties, of, substances, usually, physical, the, predicates, that, we, use, to, describe, mental, events, cannot, be, redescribed, in, terms, of, or, reduced, to, physical, predicates, of, natural, languages, predicate, dualism, is, most, easily, defined, as, the, negation, of, predicate, monism, predicate, monism, can, be, characterized, as, the, view, subscribed, to, by, eliminative, materialists, who, maintain, that, such, intentional, predicates, as, believe, desire, think, feel, etc, will, eventually, be, eliminated, from, both, the, language, of, science, and, from, ordinary, language, because, the, entities, to, which, they, refer, do, not, exist, predicate, dualists, believe, that, so, called, folk, psychology, with, all, of, its, propositional, attitude, ascriptions, is, an, ineliminable, part, of, the, enterprise, of, describing, explaining, and, understanding, human, mental, states, and, behavior, for, example, davidson, subscribes, to, anomalous, monism, according, to, which, there, can, be, no, strict, psychophysical, laws, which, connect, mental, and, physical, events, under, their, descriptions, as, mental, and, physical, events, however, all, mental, events, also, have, physical, descriptions, it, is, in, terms, of, the, latter, that, such, events, can, be, connected, in, law, like, relations, with, other, physical, events, mental, predicates, are, irreducibly, different, in, character, rational, holistic, and, necessary, from, physical, predicates, contingent, atomic, and, causal, this, part, is, about, causation, between, properties, and, states, of, the, thing, under, study, not, its, substances, or, predicates, here, a, state, is, the, set, of, all, properties, of, what, s, being, studied, thus, each, state, describes, only, one, point, in, time, interactionism, is, the, view, that, mental, states, such, as, beliefs, and, desires, causally, interact, with, physical, states, this, is, a, position, which, is, very, appealing, to, common, sense, intuitions, notwithstanding, the, fact, that, it, is, very, difficult, to, establish, its, validity, or, correctness, by, way, of, logical, argumentation, or, empirical, proof, it, seems, to, appeal, to, common, sense, because, we, are, surrounded, by, such, everyday, occurrences, as, a, child, s, touching, a, hot, stove, physical, event, which, causes, him, to, feel, pain, mental, event, and, then, yell, and, scream, physical, event, which, causes, his, parents, to, experience, a, sensation, of, fear, and, protectiveness, mental, event, and, so, on, epiphenomenalism, states, that, all, mental, events, are, caused, by, a, physical, event, and, have, no, physical, consequences, and, that, one, or, more, mental, states, do, not, have, any, influence, on, physical, states, so, the, mental, event, of, deciding, to, pick, up, a, rock, m1, is, caused, by, the, firing, of, specific, neurons, in, the, brain, p1, when, the, arm, and, hand, move, to, pick, up, the, rock, p2, this, is, not, caused, by, the, preceding, mental, event, m1, nor, by, m1, and, p1, together, but, only, by, p1, the, physical, causes, are, in, principle, reducible, to, fundamental, physics, and, therefore, mental, causes, are, eliminated, using, this, reductionist, explanation, if, p1, causes, both, m1, and, p2, there, is, no, overdetermination, in, the, explanation, for, p2, the, idea, that, even, if, the, animal, were, conscious, nothing, would, be, added, to, the, production, of, behavior, even, in, animals, of, the, human, type, was, first, voiced, by, la, mettrie, 1745, and, then, by, cabanis, 1802, and, was, further, explicated, by, hodgson, 1870, and, huxley, 1874, jackson, gave, a, subjective, argument, for, epiphenomenalism, but, later, rejected, it, and, embraced, physicalism, psychophysical, parallelism, is, a, very, unusual, view, about, the, interaction, between, mental, and, physical, events, which, was, most, prominently, and, perhaps, only, truly, advocated, by, gottfried, wilhelm, von, leibniz, like, malebranche, and, others, before, him, leibniz, recognized, the, weaknesses, of, descartes, account, of, causal, interaction, taking, place, in, a, physical, location, in, the, brain, malebranche, decided, that, such, a, material, basis, of, interaction, between, material, and, immaterial, was, impossible, and, therefore, formulated, his, doctrine, of, occasionalism, stating, that, the, interactions, were, really, caused, by, the, intervention, of, god, on, each, individual, occasion, leibniz, s, idea, is, that, god, has, created, a, pre, established, harmony, such, that, it, only, seems, as, if, physical, and, mental, events, cause, and, are, caused, by, one, another, in, reality, mental, causes, only, have, mental, effects, and, physical, causes, only, have, physical, effects, hence, the, term, parallelism, is, used, to, describe, this, view, occasionalism, is, a, philosophical, doctrine, about, causation, which, says, that, created, substances, cannot, be, efficient, causes, of, events, instead, all, events, are, taken, to, be, caused, directly, by, god, itself, the, theory, states, that, the, illusion, of, efficient, causation, between, mundane, events, arises, out, of, a, constant, conjunction, that, god, had, instituted, such, that, every, instance, where, the, cause, is, present, will, constitute, an, occasion, for, the, effect, to, occur, as, an, expression, of, the, aforementioned, power, this, occasioning, relation, however, falls, short, of, efficient, causation, in, this, view, it, is, not, the, case, that, the, first, event, causes, god, to, cause, the, second, event, rather, god, first, caused, one, and, then, caused, the, other, but, chose, to, regulate, such, behaviour, in, accordance, with, general, laws, of, nature, some, of, its, most, prominent, historical, exponents, have, been, al, ghazali, louis, de, la, forge, arnold, geulincx, and, nicolas, malebranche, according, to, the, philosophy, of, immanuel, kant, there, is, a, distinction, between, actions, done, by, desire, and, those, performed, by, reason, in, liberty, categorical, imperative, thus, not, all, physical, actions, are, caused, either, by, matter, alone, or, by, freedom, alone, some, actions, are, purely, animal, in, nature, while, others, are, the, result, of, mind, s, free, action, on, matter, hermotimus, of, clazomenae, fl, c, 6th, century, bce, was, a, philosopher, who, first, proposed, the, idea, of, mind, being, fundamental, in, the, cause, of, change, he, proposed, that, physical, entities, are, static, while, reason, causes, the, change, sextus, empiricus, places, him, with, hesiod, parmenides, and, empedocles, as, belonging, to, the, class, of, philosophers, who, held, a, dualistic, theory, of, a, material, and, an, active, principle, being, together, the, origin, of, the, universe, similar, ideas, were, expounded, by, anaxagoras, in, the, dialogue, phaedo, plato, formulated, his, famous, theory, of, forms, as, distinct, and, immaterial, substances, of, which, the, objects, and, other, phenomena, that, we, perceive, in, the, world, are, nothing, more, than, mere, shadows, in, the, phaedo, plato, makes, it, clear, that, the, forms, are, the, universalia, ante, res, i, e, they, are, ideal, universals, by, which, we, are, able, to, understand, the, world, in, his, allegory, of, the, cave, plato, likens, the, achievement, of, philosophical, understanding, to, emerging, into, the, sunlight, from, a, dark, cave, where, only, vague, shadows, of, what, lies, beyond, that, prison, are, cast, dimly, upon, the, wall, plato, s, forms, are, non, physical, and, non, mental, they, exist, nowhere, in, time, or, space, but, neither, do, they, exist, in, the, mind, nor, in, the, pleroma, of, matter, rather, matter, is, said, to, participate, in, form, methexis, it, remained, unclear, however, even, to, aristotle, exactly, what, plato, intended, by, that, aristotle, argued, at, length, against, many, aspects, of, plato, s, forms, creating, his, own, doctrine, of, hylomorphism, wherein, form, and, matter, coexist, ultimately, however, aristotle, s, aim, was, to, perfect, a, theory, of, forms, rather, than, to, reject, it, although, aristotle, strongly, rejected, the, independent, existence, plato, attributed, to, forms, his, metaphysics, do, agree, with, plato, s, a, priori, considerations, quite, often, for, example, aristotle, argues, that, changeless, eternal, substantial, form, is, necessarily, immaterial, because, matter, provides, a, stable, substratum, for, a, change, in, form, matter, always, has, the, potential, to, change, thus, if, given, an, eternity, in, which, to, do, so, it, will, necessarily, exercise, that, potential, part, of, aristotle, s, psychology, the, study, of, the, soul, is, his, account, of, the, ability, of, humans, to, reason, and, the, ability, of, animals, to, perceive, in, both, cases, perfect, copies, of, forms, are, acquired, either, by, direct, impression, of, environmental, forms, in, the, case, of, perception, or, else, by, virtue, of, contemplation, understanding, and, recollection, he, believed, the, mind, can, literally, assume, any, form, being, contemplated, or, experienced, and, it, was, unique, in, its, ability, to, become, a, blank, slate, having, no, essential, form, as, thoughts, of, earth, are, not, heavy, any, more, than, thoughts, of, fire, are, causally, efficient, they, provide, an, immaterial, complement, for, the, formless, mind, the, philosophical, school, of, neoplatonism, most, active, in, late, antiquity, claimed, that, the, physical, and, the, spiritual, are, both, emanations, of, the, one, neoplatonism, exerted, a, considerable, influence, on, christianity, as, did, the, philosophy, of, aristotle, via, scholasticism, in, the, scholastic, tradition, of, saint, thomas, aquinas, a, number, of, whose, doctrines, have, been, incorporated, into, roman, catholic, dogma, the, soul, is, the, substantial, form, of, a, human, being, aquinas, held, the, quaestiones, disputate, de, anima, or, disputed, questions, on, the, soul, at, the, roman, studium, provinciale, of, the, dominican, order, at, santa, sabina, the, forerunner, of, the, pontifical, university, of, saint, thomas, aquinas, angelicum, during, the, academic, year, 1265, 1266, by, 1268, aquinas, had, written, at, least, the, first, book, of, the, sententia, libri, de, anima, aquinas, commentary, on, aristotle, s, de, anima, the, translation, of, which, from, the, greek, was, completed, by, aquinas, dominican, associate, at, viterbo, william, of, moerbeke, in, 1267, like, aristotle, aquinas, held, that, the, human, being, was, a, unified, composite, substance, of, two, substantial, principles, form, and, matter, the, soul, is, the, substantial, form, and, so, the, first, actuality, of, a, material, organic, body, with, the, potentiality, for, life, while, aquinas, defended, the, unity, of, human, nature, as, a, composite, substance, constituted, by, these, two, inextricable, principles, of, form, and, matter, he, also, argued, for, the, incorruptibility, of, the, intellectual, soul, in, contrast, to, the, corruptibility, of, the, vegetative, and, sensitive, animation, of, plants, and, animals, his, argument, for, the, subsistence, and, incorruptibility, of, the, intellectual, soul, takes, its, point, of, departure, from, the, metaphysical, principle, that, operation, follows, upon, being, agiture, sequitur, esse, i, e, the, activity, of, a, thing, reveals, the, mode, of, being, and, existence, it, depends, upon, since, the, intellectual, soul, exercises, its, own, per, se, intellectual, operations, without, employing, material, faculties, i, e, intellectual, operations, are, immaterial, the, intellect, itself, and, the, intellectual, soul, must, likewise, be, immaterial, and, so, incorruptible, even, though, the, intellectual, soul, of, man, is, able, to, subsist, upon, the, death, of, the, human, being, aquinas, does, not, hold, that, the, human, person, is, able, to, remain, integrated, at, death, the, separated, intellectual, soul, is, neither, a, man, nor, a, human, person, the, intellectual, soul, by, itself, is, not, a, human, person, i, e, an, individual, supposit, of, a, rational, nature, hence, aquinas, held, that, soul, of, st, peter, pray, for, us, would, be, more, appropriate, than, st, peter, pray, for, us, because, all, things, connected, with, his, person, including, memories, ended, with, his, corporeal, life, the, catholic, doctrine, of, the, resurrection, of, the, body, does, not, subscribe, that, sees, body, and, soul, as, forming, a, whole, and, states, that, at, the, second, coming, the, souls, of, the, departed, will, be, reunited, with, their, bodies, as, a, whole, person, substance, and, witness, to, the, apocalypse, the, thorough, consistency, between, dogma, and, contemporary, science, was, maintained, here, in, part, from, a, serious, attendance, to, the, principle, that, there, can, be, only, one, truth, consistency, with, science, logic, philosophy, and, faith, remained, a, high, priority, for, centuries, and, a, university, doctorate, in, theology, generally, included, the, entire, science, curriculum, as, a, prerequisite, this, doctrine, is, not, universally, accepted, by, christians, today, many, believe, that, one, s, immortal, soul, goes, directly, to, heaven, upon, death, of, the, body, in, his, meditations, on, first, philosophy, ren, descartes, embarked, upon, a, quest, in, which, he, called, all, his, previous, beliefs, into, doubt, in, order, to, find, out, what, he, could, be, certain, of, in, so, doing, he, discovered, that, he, could, doubt, whether, he, had, a, body, it, could, be, that, he, was, dreaming, of, it, or, that, it, was, an, illusion, created, by, an, evil, demon, but, he, could, not, doubt, whether, he, had, a, mind, this, gave, descartes, his, first, inkling, that, the, mind, and, body, were, different, things, the, mind, according, to, descartes, was, a, thinking, thing, latin, res, cogitans, and, an, immaterial, substance, this, thing, was, the, essence, of, himself, that, which, doubts, believes, hopes, and, thinks, the, body, the, thing, that, exists, res, extensa, regulates, normal, bodily, functions, such, as, heart, and, liver, according, to, descartes, animals, only, had, a, body, and, not, a, soul, which, distinguishes, humans, from, animals, the, distinction, between, mind, and, body, is, argued, in, meditation, vi, as, follows, i, have, a, clear, and, distinct, idea, of, myself, as, a, thinking, non, extended, thing, and, a, clear, and, distinct, idea, of, body, as, an, extended, and, non, thinking, thing, whatever, i, can, conceive, clearly, and, distinctly, god, can, so, create, the, central, claim, of, what, is, often, called, cartesian, dualism, in, honor, of, descartes, is, that, the, immaterial, mind, and, the, material, body, while, being, ontologically, distinct, substances, causally, interact, this, is, an, idea, that, continues, to, feature, prominently, in, many, non, european, philosophies, mental, events, cause, physical, events, and, vice, versa, but, this, leads, to, a, substantial, problem, for, cartesian, dualism, how, can, an, immaterial, mind, cause, anything, in, a, material, body, and, vice, versa, this, has, often, been, called, the, problem, of, interactionism, descartes, himself, struggled, to, come, up, with, a, feasible, answer, to, this, problem, in, his, letter, to, elisabeth, of, bohemia, princess, palatine, he, suggested, that, spirits, interacted, with, the, body, through, the, pineal, gland, a, small, gland, in, the, centre, of, the, brain, between, the, two, hemispheres, the, term, cartesian, dualism, is, also, often, associated, with, this, more, specific, notion, of, causal, interaction, through, the, pineal, gland, however, this, explanation, was, not, satisfactory, how, can, an, immaterial, mind, interact, with, the, physical, pineal, gland, because, descartes, was, such, a, difficult, theory, to, defend, some, of, his, disciples, such, as, arnold, geulincx, and, nicolas, malebranche, proposed, a, different, explanation, that, all, mind, body, interactions, required, the, direct, intervention, of, god, according, to, these, philosophers, the, appropriate, states, of, mind, and, body, were, only, the, occasions, for, such, intervention, not, real, causes, these, occasionalists, maintained, the, strong, thesis, that, all, causation, was, directly, dependent, on, god, instead, of, holding, that, all, causation, was, natural, except, for, that, between, mind, and, body, in, addition, to, already, discussed, theories, of, dualism, particularly, the, christian, and, cartesian, models, there, are, new, theories, in, the, defense, of, dualism, naturalistic, dualism, comes, from, australian, philosopher, david, chalmers, born, 1966, who, argues, there, is, an, explanatory, gap, between, objective, and, subjective, experience, that, cannot, be, bridged, by, reductionism, because, consciousness, is, at, least, logically, autonomous, of, the, physical, properties, upon, which, it, supervenes, according, to, chalmers, a, naturalistic, account, of, property, dualism, requires, a, new, fundamental, category, of, properties, described, by, new, laws, of, supervenience, the, challenge, being, analogous, to, that, of, understanding, electricity, based, on, the, mechanistic, and, newtonian, models, of, materialism, prior, to, maxwell, s, equations, a, similar, defense, comes, from, australian, philosopher, frank, jackson, born, 1943, who, revived, the, theory, of, epiphenomenalism, which, argues, that, mental, states, do, not, play, a, role, in, physical, states, jackson, argues, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, dualism, he, claims, that, functions, of, the, mind, soul, are, internal, very, private, experiences, that, are, not, accessible, to, observation, by, others, and, therefore, not, accessible, by, science, at, least, not, yet, we, can, know, everything, for, example, about, a, bat, s, facility, for, echolocation, but, we, will, never, know, how, the, bat, experiences, that, phenomenon, an, important, fact, is, that, minds, perceive, intra, mental, states, differently, from, sensory, phenomena, and, this, cognitive, difference, results, in, mental, and, physical, phenomena, having, seemingly, disparate, properties, the, subjective, argument, holds, that, these, properties, are, irreconcilable, under, a, physical, mind, mental, events, have, a, certain, subjective, quality, to, them, whereas, physical, ones, seem, not, to, so, for, example, one, may, ask, what, a, burned, finger, feels, like, or, what, the, blueness, of, the, sky, looks, like, or, what, nice, music, sounds, like, philosophers, of, mind, call, the, subjective, aspects, of, mental, events, qualia, there, is, something, that, it, s, like, to, feel, pain, to, see, a, familiar, shade, of, blue, and, so, on, there, are, qualia, involved, in, these, mental, events, and, the, claim, is, that, qualia, cannot, be, reduced, to, anything, physical, thomas, nagel, first, characterized, the, problem, of, qualia, for, physicalistic, monism, in, his, article, what, is, it, like, to, be, a, bat, nagel, argued, that, even, if, we, knew, everything, there, was, to, know, from, a, third, person, scientific, perspective, about, a, bat, s, sonar, system, we, still, wouldn, t, know, what, it, is, like, to, be, a, bat, however, others, argue, that, qualia, are, consequent, of, the, same, neurological, processes, that, engender, the, bat, s, mind, and, will, be, fully, understood, as, the, science, develops, frank, jackson, formulated, his, well, known, knowledge, argument, based, upon, similar, considerations, in, this, thought, experiment, known, as, mary, s, room, he, asks, us, to, consider, a, neuroscientist, mary, who, was, born, and, has, lived, all, of, her, life, in, a, black, and, white, room, with, a, black, and, white, television, and, computer, monitor, where, she, collects, all, the, scientific, data, she, possibly, can, on, the, nature, of, colours, jackson, asserts, that, as, soon, as, mary, leaves, the, room, she, will, come, to, have, new, knowledge, which, she, did, not, possess, before, the, knowledge, of, the, experience, of, colours, i, e, what, they, are, like, although, mary, knows, everything, there, is, to, know, about, colours, from, an, objective, third, person, perspective, she, has, never, known, according, to, jackson, what, it, was, like, to, see, red, orange, or, green, if, mary, really, learns, something, new, it, must, be, knowledge, of, something, non, physical, since, she, already, knew, everything, about, the, physical, aspects, of, colour, however, jackson, later, rejected, his, argument, and, embraced, physicalism, he, notes, that, mary, obtains, knowledge, not, of, color, but, of, a, new, intramental, state, seeing, color, also, he, notes, that, mary, might, say, wow, and, as, a, mental, state, affecting, the, physical, this, clashed, with, his, former, view, of, epiphenomenalism, david, lewis, response, to, this, argument, now, known, as, the, ability, argument, is, that, what, mary, really, came, to, know, was, simply, the, ability, to, recognize, and, identify, color, sensations, to, which, she, had, previously, not, been, exposed, daniel, dennett, and, others, also, provide, arguments, against, this, notion, the, zombie, argument, is, based, on, a, thought, experiment, proposed, by, david, chalmers, over, the, issue, of, qualia, or, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, the, basic, idea, is, that, one, can, imagine, and, therefore, conceive, the, existence, of, an, apparently, functioning, human, being, body, without, any, conscious, states, being, associated, with, it, chalmers, argument, is, that, it, seems, plausible, that, such, a, being, could, exist, because, all, that, is, needed, is, that, all, and, only, the, things, that, the, physical, sciences, describe, and, observe, about, a, human, being, must, be, true, of, the, zombie, none, of, the, concepts, involved, in, these, sciences, make, reference, to, consciousness, or, other, mental, phenomena, and, any, physical, entity, can, be, described, scientifically, via, physics, whether, it, is, conscious, or, not, the, mere, logical, possibility, of, a, p, zombie, demonstrates, that, consciousness, is, a, natural, phenomenon, beyond, the, current, unsatisfactory, explanations, chalmers, states, that, one, probably, could, not, build, a, living, p, zombie, because, living, things, seem, to, require, a, level, of, consciousness, however, unconscious, robots, built, to, simulate, humans, may, become, the, first, real, p, zombies, hence, chalmers, half, joking, calls, for, the, need, to, build, a, consciousness, meter, to, ascertain, if, any, given, entity, human, or, robot, is, conscious, or, not, others, such, as, dennett, have, argued, that, the, notion, of, a, philosophical, zombie, is, an, incoherent, or, unlikely, concept, in, particular, nothing, proves, that, an, entity, e, g, a, computer, or, robot, which, would, perfectly, mimic, human, beings, and, especially, perfectly, mimic, expressions, of, feelings, like, joy, fear, anger, would, not, indeed, experience, them, thus, having, similar, states, of, consciousness, to, what, a, real, human, would, have, it, is, argued, that, under, physicalism, one, must, either, believe, that, anyone, including, oneself, might, be, a, zombie, or, that, no, one, can, be, a, zombie, following, from, the, assertion, that, one, s, own, conviction, about, being, or, not, being, a, zombie, is, a, product, of, the, physical, world, and, is, therefore, no, different, from, anyone, else, s, howard, robinson, argues, that, if, predicate, dualism, is, correct, then, there, are, special, sciences, that, are, irreducible, to, physics, these, allegedly, irreducible, subjects, which, contain, irreducible, predicates, differ, from, hard, sciences, in, that, they, are, interest, relative, here, interest, relative, fields, depend, on, the, existence, of, minds, that, can, have, interested, perspectives, psychology, is, one, such, science, it, completely, depends, on, and, presupposes, the, existence, of, the, mind, physics, is, the, general, analysis, of, nature, conducted, in, order, to, understand, how, the, universe, behaves, on, the, other, hand, the, study, of, meteorological, weather, patterns, or, human, behavior, is, only, of, interest, to, humans, themselves, the, point, is, that, having, a, perspective, on, the, world, is, a, psychological, state, therefore, the, special, sciences, presuppose, the, existence, of, minds, which, can, have, these, states, if, one, is, to, avoid, ontological, dualism, then, the, mind, that, has, a, perspective, must, be, part, of, the, physical, reality, to, which, it, applies, its, perspective, if, this, is, the, case, then, in, order, to, perceive, the, physical, world, as, psychological, the, mind, must, have, a, perspective, on, the, physical, this, in, turn, presupposes, the, existence, of, mind, however, cognitive, science, and, psychology, do, not, require, the, mind, to, be, irreducible, and, operate, on, the, assumption, that, it, has, physical, basis, in, fact, it, is, common, in, science, to, presuppose, a, complex, system, while, fields, such, as, chemistry, biology, or, geology, could, be, verbosely, expressed, in, terms, of, quantum, field, theory, it, is, convenient, to, use, levels, of, abstraction, like, molecules, cells, or, the, mantle, it, is, often, difficult, to, decompose, these, levels, without, heavy, analysis, and, computation, sober, has, also, advanced, philosophical, arguments, against, the, notion, of, irreducibility, this, argument, concerns, the, differences, between, the, applicability, of, counterfactual, conditionals, to, physical, objects, on, the, one, hand, and, to, conscious, personal, agents, on, the, other, in, the, case, of, any, material, object, e, g, a, printer, we, can, formulate, a, series, of, counterfactuals, in, the, following, manner, somewhere, along, the, way, from, the, printer, s, being, made, up, exactly, of, the, parts, and, materials, which, actually, constitute, it, to, the, printer, s, being, made, up, of, some, different, matter, at, say, 20, the, question, of, whether, this, printer, is, the, same, printer, becomes, a, matter, of, arbitrary, convention, imagine, the, case, of, a, person, frederick, who, has, a, counterpart, born, from, the, same, egg, and, a, slightly, genetically, modified, sperm, imagine, a, series, of, counterfactual, cases, corresponding, to, the, examples, applied, to, the, printer, somewhere, along, the, way, one, is, no, longer, sure, about, the, identity, of, frederick, in, this, latter, case, it, has, been, claimed, overlap, of, constitution, cannot, be, applied, to, the, identity, of, mind, as, madell, puts, it, if, the, counterpart, of, frederick, frederickus, is, 70, constituted, of, the, same, physical, substance, as, frederick, does, this, mean, that, it, is, also, 70, mentally, identical, with, frederick, does, it, make, sense, to, say, that, something, is, mentally, 70, frederick, a, possible, solution, to, this, dilemma, is, that, of, open, individualism, richard, swinburne, in, his, book, the, existence, of, god, put, forward, an, argument, for, mind, body, dualism, based, upon, personal, identity, he, states, that, the, brain, is, composed, of, two, hemispheres, and, a, cord, linking, the, two, and, that, as, modern, science, has, shown, either, of, these, can, be, removed, without, the, person, losing, any, memories, or, mental, capacities, he, then, cites, a, thought, experiment, for, the, reader, asking, what, would, happen, if, each, of, the, two, hemispheres, of, one, person, were, placed, inside, two, different, people, either, swinburne, claims, one, of, the, two, is, me, or, neither, is, and, there, is, no, way, of, telling, which, as, each, will, have, similar, memories, and, mental, capacities, to, the, other, in, fact, swinburne, claims, even, if, one, s, mental, capacities, and, memories, are, far, more, similar, to, the, original, person, than, the, others, are, they, still, may, not, be, him, from, here, he, deduces, that, even, if, we, know, what, has, happened, to, every, single, atom, inside, a, person, s, brain, we, still, do, not, know, what, has, happened, to, them, as, an, identity, from, here, it, follows, that, a, part, of, our, mind, or, our, soul, is, immaterial, and, as, a, consequence, that, mind, body, dualism, is, true, christian, list, argues, that, benj, hellie, s, vertiginous, question, i, e, why, people, exist, as, themselves, and, not, as, someone, else, and, the, existence, of, first, personal, facts, are, a, refutation, of, physicalist, philosophies, of, consciousness, however, list, also, argues, that, this, also, refutes, standard, versions, of, mind, body, dualism, that, have, purely, third, personal, metaphysics, philosophers, and, scientists, such, as, victor, reppert, william, hasker, and, alvin, plantinga, have, developed, an, argument, for, dualism, dubbed, the, argument, from, reason, they, credit, c, s, lewis, with, first, bringing, the, argument, to, light, in, his, book, miracles, lewis, called, the, argument, the, cardinal, difficulty, of, naturalism, which, was, the, title, of, chapter, three, of, miracles, the, argument, postulates, that, if, as, naturalism, entails, all, of, our, thoughts, are, the, effect, of, a, physical, cause, then, we, have, no, reason, for, assuming, that, they, are, also, the, consequent, of, a, reasonable, ground, however, knowledge, is, apprehended, by, reasoning, from, ground, to, consequent, therefore, if, naturalism, were, true, there, would, be, no, way, of, knowing, it, or, anything, else, except, by, a, fluke, through, this, logic, the, statement, i, have, reason, to, believe, naturalism, is, valid, is, inconsistent, in, the, same, manner, as, i, never, tell, the, truth, that, is, to, conclude, its, truth, would, eliminate, the, grounds, from, which, to, reach, it, to, summarize, the, argument, in, the, book, lewis, quotes, j, b, s, haldane, who, appeals, to, a, similar, line, of, reasoning, if, my, mental, processes, are, determined, wholly, by, the, motions, of, atoms, in, my, brain, i, have, no, reason, to, suppose, that, my, beliefs, are, true, and, hence, i, have, no, reason, for, supposing, my, brain, to, be, composed, of, atoms, in, his, essay, is, theology, poetry, lewis, himself, summarises, the, argument, in, a, similar, fashion, when, he, writes, if, minds, are, wholly, dependent, on, brains, and, brains, on, biochemistry, and, biochemistry, in, the, long, run, on, the, meaningless, flux, of, the, atoms, i, cannot, understand, how, the, thought, of, those, minds, should, have, any, more, significance, than, the, sound, of, the, wind, in, the, trees, but, lewis, later, agreed, with, elizabeth, anscombe, s, response, to, his, miracles, argument, she, showed, that, an, argument, could, be, valid, and, ground, consequent, even, if, its, propositions, were, generated, via, physical, cause, and, effect, by, non, rational, factors, similar, to, anscombe, richard, carrier, and, john, beversluis, have, written, extensive, objections, to, the, argument, from, reason, on, the, untenability, of, its, first, postulate, descartes, puts, forward, two, main, arguments, for, dualism, in, meditations, firstly, the, modal, argument, or, the, clear, and, distinct, perception, argument, and, secondly, the, indivisibility, or, divisibility, argument, the, argument, is, distinguished, from, the, zombie, argument, as, it, establishes, that, the, mind, could, continue, to, exist, without, the, body, rather, than, that, the, unaltered, body, could, exist, without, the, mind, alvin, plantinga, j, p, moreland, and, edward, feser, have, both, supported, the, argument, although, feser, and, moreland, think, that, it, must, be, carefully, reformulated, in, order, to, be, effective, the, indivisibility, argument, for, dualism, was, phrased, by, descartes, as, follows, here, is, a, great, difference, between, a, mind, and, a, body, because, the, body, by, its, very, nature, is, something, divisible, whereas, the, mind, is, plainly, indivisible, insofar, as, i, am, only, a, thing, that, thinks, i, cannot, distinguish, any, parts, in, me, although, the, whole, mind, seems, to, be, united, to, the, whole, body, nevertheless, were, a, foot, or, an, arm, or, any, other, bodily, part, amputated, i, know, that, nothing, would, be, taken, away, from, the, mind, the, argument, relies, upon, leibniz, principle, of, the, identity, of, indiscernibles, which, states, that, two, things, are, the, same, if, and, only, if, they, share, all, their, properties, a, counterargument, is, the, idea, that, matter, is, not, infinitely, divisible, and, thus, that, the, mind, could, be, identified, with, material, things, that, cannot, be, divided, or, potentially, leibnizian, monads, one, argument, against, dualism, is, with, regard, to, causal, interaction, if, consciousness, the, mind, can, exist, independently, of, physical, reality, the, brain, one, must, explain, how, physical, memories, are, created, concerning, consciousness, dualism, must, therefore, explain, how, consciousness, affects, physical, reality, one, of, the, main, objections, to, dualistic, interactionism, is, lack, of, explanation, of, how, the, material, and, immaterial, are, able, to, interact, varieties, of, dualism, according, to, which, an, immaterial, mind, causally, affects, the, material, body, and, vice, versa, have, come, under, strenuous, attack, from, different, quarters, especially, in, the, 20th, century, critics, of, dualism, have, often, asked, how, something, totally, immaterial, can, affect, something, totally, material, this, is, the, basic, problem, of, causal, interaction, first, it, is, not, clear, where, the, interaction, would, take, place, for, example, burning, one, s, finger, causes, pain, apparently, there, is, some, chain, of, events, leading, from, the, burning, of, skin, to, the, stimulation, of, nerve, endings, to, something, happening, in, the, peripheral, nerves, of, one, s, body, that, lead, to, one, s, brain, to, something, happening, in, a, particular, part, of, one, s, brain, and, finally, resulting, in, the, sensation, of, pain, but, pain, is, not, supposed, to, be, spatially, locatable, it, might, be, responded, that, the, pain, takes, place, in, the, brain, but, evidently, the, pain, is, in, the, finger, this, may, not, be, a, devastating, criticism, however, there, is, a, second, problem, about, the, interaction, namely, the, question, of, how, the, interaction, takes, place, where, in, dualism, the, mind, is, assumed, to, be, non, physical, and, by, definition, outside, of, the, realm, of, science, the, mechanism, which, explains, the, connection, between, the, mental, and, the, physical, would, therefore, be, a, philosophical, proposition, as, compared, to, a, scientific, theory, for, example, compare, such, a, mechanism, to, a, physical, mechanism, that, is, well, understood, take, a, very, simple, causal, relation, such, as, when, a, cue, ball, strikes, an, eight, ball, and, causes, it, to, go, into, the, pocket, what, happens, in, this, case, is, that, the, cue, ball, has, a, certain, amount, of, momentum, as, its, mass, moves, across, the, pool, table, with, a, certain, velocity, and, then, that, momentum, is, transferred, to, the, eight, ball, which, then, heads, toward, the, pocket, compare, this, to, the, situation, in, the, brain, where, one, wants, to, say, that, a, decision, causes, some, neurons, to, fire, and, thus, causes, a, body, to, move, across, the, room, the, intention, to, cross, the, room, now, is, a, mental, event, and, as, such, it, does, not, have, physical, properties, such, as, force, if, it, has, no, force, then, it, would, seem, that, it, could, not, possibly, cause, any, neuron, to, fire, however, with, dualism, an, explanation, is, required, of, how, something, without, any, physical, properties, has, physical, effects, alfred, north, whitehead, and, later, david, ray, griffin, framed, a, new, ontology, process, philosophy, seeking, precisely, to, avoid, the, pitfalls, of, ontological, dualism, the, explanation, provided, by, arnold, geulincx, and, nicolas, malebranche, is, that, of, occasionalism, where, all, mind, body, interactions, require, the, direct, intervention, of, god, at, the, time, c, s, lewis, wrote, miracles, quantum, mechanics, and, physical, indeterminism, was, only, in, the, initial, stages, of, acceptance, but, still, lewis, stated, the, logical, possibility, that, if, the, physical, world, was, proved, to, be, indeterministic, this, would, provide, an, entry, interaction, point, into, the, traditionally, viewed, closed, system, where, a, scientifically, described, physically, probable, improbable, event, could, be, philosophically, described, as, an, action, of, a, non, physical, entity, on, physical, reality, he, states, however, that, none, of, the, arguments, in, his, book, will, rely, on, this, although, some, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, consider, wave, function, collapse, to, be, indeterminate, in, others, this, event, is, defined, as, deterministic, colin, murray, turbayne, put, forth, an, argument, that, the, mind, body, dualism, codified, within, the, cartesian, ontological, system, is, particularly, problematic, on, purely, linguistic, grounds, in, turbayne, s, view, descartes, bifurcation, of, the, substance, which, presumably, underlies, reality, as, a, whole, into, res, cogitans, and, res, extensa, is, more, properly, characterized, as, a, prime, example, of, a, category, mistake, which, is, often, associated, with, metaphorical, constructs, rather, than, an, objective, truth, citing, the, work, of, berkeley, turbayne, holds, that, the, cartesian, concepts, of, substance, and, substratum, convey, little, if, any, meaning, at, best, he, further, argues, that, mankind, s, general, acceptance, of, the, mind, body, dualism, can, be, traced, to, an, inadvertent, use, of, deductive, logic, to, incorporate, mechanistic, and, physicalist, metaphors, from, the, works, of, both, descartes, and, isaac, newton, into, modern, scientific, hypotheses, in, short, turbayne, holds, that, as, a, result, of, a, misguided, and, literal, interpretation, of, the, concepts, underlying, mind, body, dualism, mankind, has, fallen, victim, to, a, metaphor, which, has, taken, on, the, guise, of, an, objective, scientific, truth, the, argument, from, physics, is, closely, related, to, the, argument, from, causal, interaction, many, physicists, and, consciousness, researchers, have, argued, that, any, action, of, a, nonphysical, mind, on, the, brain, would, entail, the, violation, of, physical, laws, such, as, the, conservation, of, energy, by, assuming, a, deterministic, physical, universe, the, objection, can, be, formulated, more, precisely, when, a, person, decides, to, walk, across, a, room, it, is, generally, understood, that, the, decision, to, do, so, a, mental, event, immediately, causes, a, group, of, neurons, in, that, person, s, brain, to, fire, a, physical, event, which, ultimately, results, in, his, walking, across, the, room, the, problem, is, that, if, there, is, something, totally, non, physical, causing, a, bunch, of, neurons, to, fire, then, there, is, no, physical, event, which, causes, the, firing, this, means, that, some, physical, energy, is, required, to, be, generated, against, the, physical, laws, of, the, deterministic, universe, this, is, by, definition, a, miracle, and, there, can, be, no, scientific, explanation, of, repeatable, experiment, performed, regarding, where, the, physical, energy, for, the, firing, came, from, such, interactions, would, violate, the, fundamental, laws, of, physics, in, particular, if, some, external, source, of, energy, is, responsible, for, the, interactions, then, this, would, violate, the, law, of, the, conservation, of, energy, dualistic, interactionism, has, therefore, been, criticized, for, violating, a, general, heuristic, principle, of, science, the, causal, closure, of, the, physical, world, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, and, the, new, catholic, encyclopedia, provide, two, possible, replies, to, the, above, objections, the, first, reply, is, that, the, mind, may, influence, the, distribution, of, energy, without, altering, its, quantity, the, second, possibility, is, to, deny, that, the, human, body, is, causally, closed, as, the, conservation, of, energy, applies, only, to, closed, systems, however, physicalists, object, that, no, evidence, exists, for, the, causal, non, closure, of, the, human, body, robin, collins, responds, that, energy, conservation, objections, misunderstand, the, role, of, energy, conservation, in, physics, well, understood, scenarios, in, general, relativity, violate, energy, conservation, and, quantum, mechanics, provides, precedent, for, causal, interactions, or, correlation, without, energy, or, momentum, exchange, however, this, does, not, mean, the, mind, spends, energy, and, despite, that, it, still, doesn, t, exclude, the, supernatural, another, reply, is, akin, to, parallelism, mills, holds, that, behavioral, events, are, causally, overdetermined, and, can, be, explained, by, either, physical, or, mental, causes, alone, an, overdetermined, event, is, fully, accounted, for, by, multiple, causes, at, once, however, j, j, c, smart, and, paul, churchland, have, pointed, out, that, if, physical, phenomena, fully, determine, behavioral, events, then, by, occam, s, razor, an, unphysical, mind, is, unnecessary, howard, robinson, suggests, that, the, interaction, may, involve, dark, energy, dark, matter, or, some, other, currently, unknown, scientific, process, another, reply, is, that, the, interaction, taking, place, in, the, human, body, may, not, be, described, by, billiard, ball, classical, mechanics, if, a, nondeterministic, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, is, correct, then, microscopic, events, are, indeterminate, where, the, degree, of, determinism, increases, with, the, scale, of, the, system, philosophers, karl, popper, and, john, eccles, and, physicist, henry, stapp, have, theorized, that, such, indeterminacy, may, apply, at, the, macroscopic, scale, however, max, tegmark, has, argued, that, classical, and, quantum, calculations, show, that, quantum, decoherence, effects, do, not, play, a, role, in, brain, activity, yet, another, reply, to, the, interaction, problem, is, to, note, that, it, doesn, t, seem, that, there, is, an, interaction, problem, for, all, forms, of, substance, dualism, for, instance, thomistic, dualism, doesn, t, obviously, face, any, issue, with, regards, to, interaction, for, in, this, view, the, soul, and, the, body, are, related, as, form, and, matter, this, argument, has, been, formulated, by, paul, churchland, among, others, the, point, is, that, in, instances, of, some, sort, of, brain, damage, e, g, caused, by, automobile, accidents, drug, abuse, pathological, diseases, etc, it, is, always, the, case, that, the, mental, substance, and, or, properties, of, the, person, are, significantly, changed, or, compromised, if, the, mind, were, a, completely, separate, substance, from, the, brain, how, could, it, be, possible, that, every, single, time, the, brain, is, injured, the, mind, is, also, injured, indeed, it, is, very, frequently, the, case, that, one, can, even, predict, and, explain, the, kind, of, mental, or, psychological, deterioration, or, change, that, human, beings, will, undergo, when, specific, parts, of, their, brains, are, damaged, so, the, question, for, the, dualist, to, try, to, confront, is, how, can, all, of, this, be, explained, if, the, mind, is, a, separate, and, immaterial, substance, from, or, if, its, properties, are, ontologically, independent, of, the, brain, phineas, gage, who, suffered, destruction, of, one, or, both, frontal, lobes, by, a, projectile, iron, rod, is, often, cited, as, an, example, illustrating, that, the, brain, causes, mind, gage, certainly, exhibited, some, mental, changes, after, his, accident, suggesting, a, correlation, between, brain, states, and, mental, states, it, has, been, noted, however, that, gage, s, most, serious, mental, changes, were, only, temporary, and, that, he, made, a, reasonable, social, and, mental, recovery, the, changes, in, question, have, almost, always, been, distorted, and, exaggerated, by, scientific, and, popular, literature, often, relying, on, hearsay, similar, examples, abound, neuroscientist, david, eagleman, describes, the, case, of, another, individual, who, exhibited, escalating, pedophilic, tendencies, at, two, different, times, and, in, each, case, was, found, to, have, tumors, growing, in, a, particular, part, of, his, brain, case, studies, aside, modern, experiments, have, demonstrated, that, the, relation, between, brain, and, mind, is, much, more, than, simple, correlation, by, damaging, or, manipulating, specific, areas, of, the, brain, repeatedly, under, controlled, conditions, e, g, in, monkeys, and, reliably, obtaining, the, same, results, in, measures, of, mental, state, and, abilities, neuroscientists, have, shown, that, the, relation, between, damage, to, the, brain, and, mental, deterioration, is, likely, causal, this, conclusion, is, further, supported, by, data, from, the, effects, of, neuro, active, chemicals, e, g, those, affecting, neurotransmitters, on, mental, functions, but, also, from, research, on, neurostimulation, direct, electrical, stimulation, of, the, brain, including, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, property, dualism, and, william, hasker, s, emergent, dualism, seek, to, avoid, this, problem, they, assert, that, the, mind, is, a, property, or, substance, that, emerges, from, the, appropriate, arrangement, of, physical, matter, and, therefore, could, be, affected, by, any, rearrangement, of, matter, writing, in, the, 13th, century, st, thomas, aquinas, writes, that, the, body, is, necessary, for, the, action, of, the, intellect, not, as, it, s, origin, of, action, thus, if, the, body, is, dysfunctional, the, intellect, will, not, actualize, as, it, intends, to, according, to, the, philosopher, stephen, evans, we, did, not, need, neurophysiology, to, come, to, know, that, a, person, whose, head, is, bashed, in, with, a, club, quickly, loses, his, or, her, ability, to, think, or, have, any, conscious, processes, why, should, we, not, think, of, neurophysiological, findings, as, giving, us, detailed, precise, knowledge, of, something, that, human, beings, have, always, known, or, at, least, could, have, known, which, is, that, the, mind, at, least, in, this, mortal, life, requires, and, depends, on, a, functioning, brain, we, now, know, a, lot, more, than, we, used, to, know, about, precisely, how, the, mind, depends, on, the, body, however, that, the, mind, depends, on, the, body, at, least, prior, to, death, is, surely, not, something, discovered, in, the, 20th, century, in, some, contexts, the, decisions, that, a, person, makes, can, be, detected, up, to, 10, seconds, in, advance, by, means, of, scanning, their, brain, activity, subjective, experiences, and, covert, attitudes, can, be, detected, as, can, mental, imagery, this, is, strong, empirical, evidence, that, cognitive, processes, have, a, physical, basis, in, the, brain, the, argument, from, simplicity, is, probably, the, simplest, and, also, the, most, common, form, of, argument, against, dualism, of, the, mental, the, dualist, is, always, faced, with, the, question, of, why, anyone, should, find, it, necessary, to, believe, in, the, existence, of, two, ontologically, distinct, entities, mind, and, brain, when, it, seems, possible, and, would, make, for, a, simpler, thesis, to, test, against, scientific, evidence, to, explain, the, same, events, and, properties, in, terms, of, one, it, is, a, heuristic, principle, in, science, and, philosophy, not, to, assume, the, existence, of, more, entities, than, is, necessary, for, clear, explanation, and, prediction, this, argument, was, criticized, by, peter, glassen, in, a, debate, with, j, j, c, smart, in, the, pages, of, philosophy, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, glassen, argued, that, because, it, is, not, a, physical, entity, occam, s, razor, cannot, consistently, be, appealed, to, by, a, physicalist, or, materialist, as, a, justification, of, mental, states, or, events, such, as, the, belief, that, dualism, is, false, the, idea, is, that, occam, s, razor, may, not, be, as, unrestricted, as, it, is, normally, described, applying, to, all, qualitative, postulates, even, abstract, ones, but, instead, concrete, only, applies, to, physical, objects, if, one, applies, occam, s, razor, unrestrictedly, then, it, recommends, monism, until, pluralism, either, receives, more, support, or, is, disproved, if, one, applies, occam, s, razor, only, concretely, then, it, may, not, be, used, on, abstract, concepts, this, route, however, has, serious, consequences, for, selecting, between, hypotheses, about, the, abstract, this, argument, has, also, been, criticized, by, seyyed, jaaber, mousavirad, who, argues, that, the, principle, of, simplicity, could, only, be, applied, when, there, is, no, need, for, an, additional, entity, despite, arguments, indicating, the, need, for, the, soul, the, principle, of, simplicity, does, not, apply, therefore, if, there, were, no, argument, establishing, the, existence, of, the, soul, one, could, deny, its, existence, based, on, the, principle, of, simplicity, however, various, arguments, have, been, put, forth, to, establish, its, existence, these, arguments, demonstrate, that, while, neuroscience, can, explain, the, mysteries, of, the, material, brain, certain, significant, issues, such, as, personal, identity, and, free, will, remain, beyond, the, scope, of, neuroscience, the, crux, of, the, matter, lies, in, the, essential, limitations, of, neuroscience, and, the, potency, of, substance, dualism, in, explaining, these, phenomena
