produced, the, book, three, worlds, which, combined, restitutionist, views, with, end, time, prophecy, the, book, taught, that, god, s, dealings, with, humanity, were, divided, dispensationally, each, ending, with, a, harvest, that, jesus, had, returned, as, an, invisible, spirit, being, in, 1874, inaugurating, the, harvest, of, the, gospel, age, and, that, 1914, would, mark, the, end, of, a, 2,

his, election, was, disputed, and, members, of, the, board, of, directors, accused, him, of, acting, in, an, autocratic, and, secretive, manner, the, divisions, between, his, supporters, and, opponents, triggered, a, major, turnover, of, members, over, the, next, decade, in, june, 1917, he, released, the, finished, mystery, as, a, seventh, volume, of, russell, s, studies, in, the, scriptures, series, the, book, published, as, russell, s, posthumous, work, was, a, compilation, of, his, commentaries, on, the, bible, books, of, ezekiel, and, revelation, with, numerous, additions, by, bible, students, clayton, woodworth, and, george, fisher, it, strongly, criticized, catholic, and, protestant, clergy, and, christian, involvement, in, the, great, war, as, a, result, watch, tower, society, directors, were, jailed, for, sedition, under, the, espionage, act, in, 1918, and, members, were, subjected, to, mob, violence, the, directors, were, released, in, march, 1919, and,

each, congregation, and, a, year, later, all, members, were, instructed, to, report, their, weekly, preaching, activity, to, the, brooklyn, headquarters, significant, changes, in, doctrine, and, administration, were, regularly, introduced, during, rutherford, s, 25, years, as, president, including, the, 1920, announcement, that, the, hebrew, patriarchs, such, as, abraham, and, isaac, would, be, resurrected, in, 1925, marking, the, beginning, of, christ, s, thousand, year, earthly, kingdom, because, of, disappointment, over, the, changes, and, unfulfilled, predictions, tens, of, thousands, of, defections, occurred, during, the, first, half, of, rutherford, s, tenure, leading, to, the, formation, of, several, bible, student, organizations, independent, of, the, watch, tower, society, most, of, which, still, exist, by, mid, 1919, as, many, as, one, in, seven, of, russell, era, bible, students, had, ceased, their, association, with, the, society, and, as, many, as, three, quarters, by, the, end, of, the, 1920s, on, july, 26, 1931, at, a, convention, in, columbus, ohio, rutherford, introduced, the, new, name, jehovah, s, witnesses, based, on, isaiah, 43, 10, ye, are, my, witnesses, saith, the, lord, and, my, servant, whom, i, have, chosen, that, ye, may, know, and, believe, me, and, understand, that, i, am, he, before, me, there, was, no, god, formed, neither, shall, there, be, after, me, king, james, version, it, was, adopted, by, resolution, the, name, was, chosen, to, distinguish, his, group, of, bible, students, from, other, independent, groups, that, had, severed, ties, with, the, society, as, well, as, to, symbolize, the, instigation, of, new, outlooks, and, the, promotion, of, fresh, evangelizing, methods, in, 1932, rutherford, eliminated, the, system, of, locally, elected, elders, and, in, 1938, he, introduced, what, he, called, a, theocratic, literally, god, ruled, organizational, system, under, which, appointments, in, congregations, worldwide, were, made, from, the, brooklyn, headquarters, from, 1932, it, was, taught, that, the, little, flock, of, 144, 000, would, not, be, the, only, people, to, survive, armageddon, rutherford, explained, that, in, addition, to, the, 144, 000, anointed, who, would, be, resurrected, or, transferred, at, death, to, live, in, heaven, to, rule, over, earth, with, jesus, a, separate, class, of, members, the, great, multitude, would, live, in, a, paradise, restored, on, earth, from, 1935, new, converts, to, the, movement, were, considered, part, of, that, class, by, the, mid, 1930s, the, timing, of, the, beginning, of, jesus, presence, greek, parous, a, his, enthronement, as, king, and, the, start, of, the, last, days, were, each, moved, to, 1914, as, their, interpretations, of, the, bible, evolved, witness, publications, decreed, that, saluting, national, flags, is, a, form, of, idolatry, which, led, to, a, new, outbreak, of, mob, violence, and, government, opposition, in, the, united, states, canada, germany, and, other, countries, nathan, knorr, was, appointed, as, third, president, of, the, watch, tower, bible, and, tract, society, in, 1942, he, commissioned, a, new, translation, of, the, bible, the, new, world, translation, of, the, holy, scriptures, the, full, version, of, which, was, released, in, 1961, he, organized, large, international, assemblies, instituted, new, training, programs, for, members, and, expanded, missionary, activity, and, branch, offices, throughout, the, world, knorr, s, presidency, was, also, marked, by, increased, use, of, explicit, instructions, guiding, jehovah, s, witnesses, lifestyle, and, conduct, and, a, greater, use, of, congregational, judicial, procedures, to, enforce, a, strict, moral, code, from, 1966, witness, publications, and, convention, talks, built, anticipation, of, the, possibility, that, jesus, thousand, year, reign, might, begin, in, 1975, or, shortly, thereafter, the, number, of,

tower, society, admitted, its, responsibility, in, building, up, hope, for, that, year, the, offices, of, elder, and, ministerial, servant, were, restored, to, witness, congregations, in, 1972, with, appointments, made, from, headquarters, and, later, by, branch, committees, too, it, was, announced, that, as, of, september, 2014, appointments, would, be, made, by, traveling, overseers, in, a, major, organizational, overhaul, in, 1976, the, power, of, the, watch, tower, society, president, was, diminished, with, authority, for, doctrinal, and, organizational, decisions, passed, to, the, governing, body, since, knorr, s, death, in, 1977, the, presidency, has, been, held, by, frederick, franz, milton, henschel, don, alden, adams, and, robert, ciranko, in, 1995, jehovah, s, witnesses,

witness, members, would, no, longer, be, required, to, report, the, number, of, hours, spent, proselytizing, jehovah, s, witnesses, are, organized, hierarchically, in, what, the, leadership, calls, a, theocratic, organization, reflecting, their, belief, that, it, is, god, s, visible, organization, on, earth, jehovah, s, witnesses, establish, local, branch, offices, to, centralize, their, activities, in, any, given, country, these, branch, offices, are, also, referred, to, as, bethel, supporting, staff, live, on, these, properties, where, they, operate, as, a, religious, community, and, administrative, unit, their, living, expenses, and, those, of, other, full, time, volunteers, are, covered, along, with, a, basic, monthly, stipend, these, volunteers, are, called, bethelites,

established, by, the, governing, body, which, assumes, responsibility, for, interpreting, and, applying, scripture, the, governing, body, does, not, issue, a, single, comprehensive, statement, of, faith, but, expresses, its, doctrinal, positions, in, a, variety, of, ways, through, publications, published, by, the, watch, tower, society, the, publications, teach, that, doctrinal, changes, and, refinements, result, from, a, process, of, progressive, revelation, in, which, god, gradually, reveals, his, will, and, purpose, and, that, such, enlightenment, or, new, light, results, from, the, application, of, reason, and, study, sociologist, andrew, holden, s, ethnographic, study, of, the, group, concluded, that, pronouncements, of, the, governing, body, through, watch, tower, society, publications, carry, almost, as, much, weight, as, the, bible, jehovah, s, witnesses, consider, the, bible, scientifically, and, historically, accurate, and, reliable, and, interpret, much, of, it, literally, but, accept, parts, of, it, as, symbolic, the, entire, protestant, canon, of, scripture, is, considered, the, inspired, inerrant, word, of, god, regular, personal, bible, reading, is,

emphasized, for, both, men, and, women, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, their, denomination, is, a, restoration, of, first, century, christianity, jehovah, s, witnesses, emphasize, the, use, of, god, s, name, and, they, prefer, the, form, jehovah, a, vocalization, of, god, s, name, based, on, the, tetragrammaton, they, believe, that, jehovah, is, the, only, true, god, the, creator, of, all, things, and, the, universal, sovereign, they, believe, that, all, worship, should, be, directed, toward, him, and, that, he, is, not, part, of, a, trinity, consequently, the, group, places, more, emphasis, on, god, than, on, christ, they, believe, that, the, holy, spirit, is, god, s, applied, power, or, active, force, rather, than, a, person, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, jesus, is, god, s, only, direct, creation, that, everything, else, was, created, through, him, by, means, of, god, s, power, and, that, the, initial, unassisted, act, of, creation, uniquely, identifies, jesus, as, god, s, only, begotten, son, however, as, part, of, their, nontrinitarian, beliefs, they, do, not, believe, that, jesus, is, god, the, son, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, mary, conceived, jesus, as, a, virgin, but, do, not, believe, that, she, was, born, free, from, sin, or, that, she, remained, a, virgin, after, his, birth, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, jesus, served, as, a, redeemer, and, a, ransom, sacrifice, to, pay, for, the, sins, of, humanity, they, believe, that, he, died, on, a, single, upright, post, rather, than, a, cross, which, they, regard, as, a, pagan, symbol, accordingly, they, refrain, from, using, the, word, crucifixion, when, referring, to, jesus, death, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, jesus, was, resurrected, with, a, spirit, body, and, that, he, assumed, human, form, only, temporarily, after, his, resurrection, biblical, references, to, the, archangel, michael, abaddon, apollyon, and, the, word, are, interpreted, as, names, for, jesus, in, various, roles, jesus, is, considered, the, only, intercessor, and, high, priest, between, god, and, humanity, appointed, by, god, as, the, king, and, judge, of, his, kingdom, his, role, as, a, mediator, referred, to, in, 1, timothy, 2, 5, is, applied, to, the, anointed, class, though, the, other, sheep, are, said, to, also, benefit, from, the, arrangement, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, death, is, a, state, of, nonexistence, with, no, consciousness, there, is, no, hell, of, fiery, torment, hades, and, sheol, are, understood, to, refer, to, the, condition, of, death, termed, the, common, grave, they, consider, the, soul, a, life, or, a, living, body, that, can, die, they, believe, that, humanity, is, in, a, sinful, state, from, which, release, is, possible, only, by, means, of, jesus, shed, blood, as, a, ransom, or, atonement, for, humankind, s, sins, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, a, little, flock, of, 144, 000, selected, humans, go, to, heaven, but, that, god, will, resurrect, the, majority, the, other, sheep, to, a, cleansed, earth, after, armageddon, they, interpret, revelation, 14, 1, 5, to, mean, that, the, number, of, christians, going, to, heaven, is, limited, to, exactly, 144, 000, who, will, rule, with, jesus, as, kings, and, priests, over, earth, they, believe, that, baptism, as, a, jehovah, s, witness, is, vital, for, salvation, and, do, not, recognize, baptism, from, other, denominations, as, valid, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, some, people, who, died, before, armageddon, will, be, resurrected, will, be, taught, the, proper, way, to, worship, god, and, face, a, final, test, at, the, end, of, the, millennial, reign, this, judgment, will, be, based, on, their, actions, after, resurrection, rather, than, past, deeds, at, the, end, of, the, thousand, years, jesus, will, hand, all, authority, back, to, god, then, a, final, test, will, take, place, when, satan, is, released, to, mislead, humankind, those, who, fail, will, die, along, with, satan, and, his, demons, they, also, believe, that, those, who, rejected, their, beliefs, while, still, alive, will, not, be, resurrected, and, will, continue, to, experience, a, state, of, non, existence, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, satan, was, originally, a, perfect, angel, who, developed, feelings, of, self, importance, and, craved, worship, satan, influenced, adam, and, eve, to, disobey, god, and, humanity, subsequently, became, participants, in, a, challenge, involving, the, competing, claims, of, jehovah, and, satan, to, universal, sovereignty, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, jesus, began, to, rule, invisibly, in, heaven, as, king, of, god, s, kingdom, in, october, 1914, and, that, satan, was, subsequently, ousted, from, heaven, to, the, earth, they, base, this, belief, on, a, rendering, of, the, greek, word, parousia, usually, translated, as, coming, when, referring, to, jesus, as, presence, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, they, are, the, kingdom, s, representatives, on, earth, they, also, believe, that, they, must, remain, separate, from, human, governments, which, they, consider, to, be, controlled, by, satan, the, kingdom, is, viewed, as, the, means, by, which, god, will, accomplish, his, original, purpose, for, the, earth, transforming, it, into, a, paradise, without, sickness, or, death, a, central, teaching, of, jehovah, s, witnesses, is, that, the, world, faces, imminent, destruction, through, intervention, by, god, and, jesus, christ, this, belief, has, been, present, since, the, group, s, founding, they, believe, that, jesus, inauguration, as, king, in, 1914, is, a, sign, that, the, great, tribulation, is, about, to, take, place, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, all, other, present, day, religions, are, false, identifying, them, with, babylon, the, great, the, harlot, of, revelation, 17, they, also, believe, that, the, united, nations, is, the, scarlet, colored, wild, beast, satan, will, subsequently, use, world, governments, to, attack, jehovah, s, witnesses, which, will, prompt, god, to, begin, the, war, of, armageddon, during, which, all, forms, of,
