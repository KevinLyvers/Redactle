western, esotericism, also, known, as, esotericism, esoterism, and, sometimes, the, western, mystery, tradition, is, a, term, scholars, use, to, classify, a, wide, range, of, loosely, related, ideas, and, movements, that, developed, within, western, society, these, ideas, and, currents, are, united, since, they, are, largely, distinct, both, from, orthodox, judeo, christian, religion, and, age, of, enlightenment, rationalism, it, has, influenced, or, contributed, to, various, forms, of, western, philosophy, mysticism, religion, pseudoscience, art, literature, and, music, the, idea, of, grouping, a, wide, range, of, western, traditions, and, philosophies, together, under, the, term, esotericism, developed, in, 17th, century, europe, various, academics, have, debated, numerous, definitions, of, western, esotericism, one, view, adopts, a, definition, from, certain, esotericist, schools, of, thought, themselves, treating, esotericism, as, a, perennial, hidden, inner, tradition, a, second, perspective, sees, esotericism, as, a, category, of, movements, that, embrace, an, enchanted, worldview, in, the, face, of, increasing, disenchantment, a, third, views, western, esotericism, as, encompassing, all, of, western, culture, s, rejected, knowledge, that, is, accepted, neither, by, the, scientific, establishment, nor, orthodox, religious, authorities, the, earliest, traditions, of, western, esotericism, emerged, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, during, late, antiquity, where, hermeticism, gnosticism, and, neoplatonism, developed, as, schools, of, thought, distinct, from, what, became, mainstream, christianity, renaissance, europe, saw, increasing, interest, in, many, of, these, older, ideas, with, various, intellectuals, combining, pagan, philosophies, with, the, kabbalah, and, christian, philosophy, resulting, in, the, emergence, of, esoteric, movements, like, christian, kabbalah, and, christian, theosophy, the, 17th, century, saw, the, development, of, initiatory, societies, professing, esoteric, knowledge, such, as, rosicrucianism, and, freemasonry, while, the, age, of, enlightenment, of, the, 18th, century, led, to, the, development, of, new, forms, of, esoteric, thought, the, 19th, century, saw, the, emergence, of, new, trends, of, esoteric, thought, now, known, as, occultism, significant, groups, in, this, century, included, the, societas, rosicruciana, in, anglia, the, theosophical, society, and, the, hermetic, order, of, the, golden, dawn, also, important, in, this, connection, is, martinus, thomsen, s, spiritual, science, modern, paganism, developed, within, occultism, and, includes, religious, movements, such, as, wicca, esoteric, ideas, permeated, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, and, later, cultural, tendencies, which, led, to, the, new, age, phenomenon, in, the, 1970s, the, idea, that, these, disparate, movements, could, be, classified, as, western, esotericism, developed, in, the, late, 18th, century, but, these, esoteric, currents, were, largely, ignored, as, a, subject, of, academic, enquiry, the, academic, study, of, western, esotericism, only, emerged, in, the, late, 20th, century, pioneered, by, scholars, like, frances, yates, and, antoine, faivre, the, concept, of, the, esoteric, originated, in, the, 2nd, century, with, the, coining, of, the, ancient, greek, adjective, es, terik, s, belonging, to, an, inner, circle, the, earliest, known, example, of, the, word, appeared, in, a, satire, authored, by, lucian, of, samosata, c, 125, after, 180, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, differentiations, in, latin, between, exotericus, and, esotericus, along, with, internus, and, externus, were, common, in, the, scholar, discourse, on, ancient, philosophy, the, categories, of, doctrina, vulgaris, and, doctrina, arcana, are, found, among, cambridge, platonists, perhaps, for, the, first, time, in, english, thomas, stanley, between, 1655, and, 1660, would, refer, to, the, pythagorean, exoterick, and, esoterick, john, toland, in, 1720, would, state, that, the, so, called, nowadays, esoteric, distinction, was, a, universal, phenomenon, present, in, both, the, west, and, the, east, as, for, the, noun, esotericism, probably, the, first, mention, in, german, of, esoterismus, appeared, in, a, 1779, work, by, johann, georg, hamann, and, the, use, of, esoterik, in, 1790, by, johann, gottfried, eichhorn, but, the, word, esoterisch, had, already, existed, at, least, since, 1731, 1736, as, found, in, the, works, of, johann, jakob, brucker, this, author, rejected, everything, that, is, characterized, today, as, an, esoteric, corpus, in, this, 18th, century, context, these, terms, referred, to, pythagoreanism, or, neoplatonic, theurgy, but, the, concept, was, particularly, sedimentated, by, two, streams, of, discourses, speculations, about, the, influences, of, the, egyptians, on, ancient, philosophy, and, religion, and, their, associations, with, masonic, discourses, and, other, secret, societies, who, claimed, to, keep, such, ancient, secrets, until, the, enlightenment, and, the, emergence, of, orientalist, academic, studies, which, since, the, 17th, century, identified, the, presence, of, mysteries, secrets, or, esoteric, ancient, wisdom, in, persian, arab, indian, and, far, eastern, texts, and, practices, see, also, early, western, reception, of, eastern, esotericism, the, noun, esotericism, in, its, french, form, sot, risme, first, appeared, in, 1828, in, the, work, by, protestant, historian, of, gnosticism, jacques, matter, 1791, 1864, histoire, critique, du, gnosticisme, 3, vols, the, term, esotericism, thus, came, into, use, in, the, wake, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, of, its, critique, of, institutionalised, religion, during, which, alternative, religious, groups, such, as, the, rosicrucians, began, to, disassociate, themselves, from, the, dominant, christianity, in, western, europe, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, scholars, increasingly, saw, the, term, esotericism, as, meaning, something, distinct, from, christianity, as, a, subculture, at, odds, with, the, christian, mainstream, from, at, least, the, time, of, the, renaissance, after, being, introduced, by, jacques, matter, in, french, the, occultist, and, ceremonial, magician, eliphas, l, vi, 1810, 1875, popularized, the, term, in, the, 1850s, l, vi, also, introduced, the, term, l, occultisme, a, notion, that, he, developed, against, the, background, of, contemporary, socialist, and, catholic, discourses, esotericism, and, occultism, were, often, employed, as, synonyms, until, later, scholars, distinguished, the, concepts, in, the, context, of, ancient, greek, philosophy, the, terms, esoteric, and, exoteric, were, sometimes, used, by, scholars, not, to, denote, that, there, was, secrecy, but, to, distinguish, two, procedures, of, research, and, education, the, first, reserved, for, teachings, that, were, developed, within, the, walls, of, the, philosophical, school, among, a, circle, of, thinkers, eso, indicating, what, is, unseen, as, in, the, classes, internal, to, the, institution, and, the, second, referring, to, those, whose, works, were, disseminated, to, the, public, in, speeches, and, published, exo, outside, the, initial, meaning, of, this, last, word, is, implied, when, aristotle, coined, the, term, exoteric, speeches, perhaps, to, refer, to, the, speeches, he, gave, outside, his, school, however, aristotle, never, employed, the, term, esoteric, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, dealt, with, specialized, secrets, there, is, a, dubious, report, by, aulus, gellius, according, to, which, aristotle, disclosed, the, exoteric, subjects, of, politics, rhetoric, and, ethics, to, the, general, public, in, the, afternoon, while, he, reserved, the, morning, for, akroatika, acroamatics, referring, to, natural, philosophy, and, logic, taught, during, a, walk, with, his, students, furthermore, the, term, exoteric, for, aristotle, could, have, another, meaning, hypothetically, referring, to, an, extracosmic, reality, ta, exo, superior, to, and, beyond, heaven, requiring, abstraction, and, logic, this, reality, stood, in, contrast, to, what, he, called, enkyklioi, logoi, knowledge, from, within, the, circle, involving, the, intracosmic, physics, that, surrounds, everyday, life, there, is, a, report, by, strabo, and, plutarch, however, which, states, that, the, lyceum, s, school, texts, were, circulated, internally, their, publication, was, more, controlled, than, the, exoteric, ones, and, that, these, esoteric, texts, were, rediscovered, and, compiled, only, with, the, efforts, of, andronicus, of, rhodes, plato, would, have, orally, transmitted, intramural, teachings, to, his, disciples, the, supposed, esoteric, content, of, which, regarding, the, first, principles, is, particularly, highlighted, by, the, t, bingen, school, as, distinct, from, the, apparent, written, teachings, conveyed, in, his, books, or, public, lectures, hegel, commented, on, the, analysis, of, this, distinction, in, the, modern, hermeneutics, of, plato, and, aristotle, to, express, an, external, object, not, much, is, required, but, to, communicate, an, idea, a, capacity, must, be, present, and, this, always, remains, something, esoteric, so, that, there, has, never, been, anything, purely, exoteric, about, what, philosophers, say, in, any, case, drawing, from, the, tradition, of, discourses, that, supposedly, revealed, a, vision, of, the, absolute, and, truth, present, in, mythology, and, initiatory, rites, of, mystery, religions, plato, and, his, philosophy, began, the, western, perception, of, esotericism, to, the, point, that, kocku, von, stuckrad, stated, esoteric, ontology, and, anthropology, would, hardly, exist, without, platonic, philosophy, in, his, dialogues, he, uses, expressions, that, refer, to, cultic, secrecy, for, example, aporrh, ton, one, of, the, ancient, greek, expressions, referring, to, the, prohibition, of, revealing, a, secret, in, the, context, of, mysteries, in, theaetetus, 152c, there, is, an, example, of, this, concealment, strategy, can, it, be, then, that, protagoras, was, a, very, ingenious, person, who, threw, out, this, obscure, utterance, for, the, unwashed, like, us, but, reserved, the, truth, as, a, secret, doctrine, to, be, revealed, to, his, disciples, the, neoplatonists, intensified, the, search, for, a, hidden, truth, under, the, surface, of, teachings, myths, and, texts, developing, the, hermeneutics, and, allegorical, exegesis, of, plato, homer, orpheus, and, others, plutarch, for, example, developed, the, justification, of, a, theological, esotericism, and, numenius, wrote, on, the, secrets, of, plato, peri, t, n, para, platoni, aporrh, ta, probably, based, on, the, ex, tikos, es, tikos, dichotomy, the, hellenic, world, developed, the, classical, distinction, between, exoteric, esoteric, stimulated, by, criticism, from, various, currents, such, as, the, patristics, according, to, examples, in, lucian, galen, and, clement, of, alexandria, at, that, time, it, was, a, common, practice, among, philosophers, to, keep, secret, writings, and, teachings, a, parallel, secrecy, and, reserved, elite, was, also, found, in, the, contemporary, environment, of, gnosticism, later, iamblichus, would, present, his, definition, close, to, the, modern, one, as, he, classified, the, ancient, pythagoreans, as, either, exoteric, mathematicians, or, esoteric, acousmatics, the, latter, being, those, who, disseminated, enigmatic, teachings, and, hidden, allegorical, meanings, western, esotericism, is, not, a, natural, term, but, an, artificial, category, applied, retrospectively, to, a, range, of, currents, and, ideas, that, were, known, by, other, names, at, least, prior, to, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, means, that, originally, not, all, those, currents, and, ideas, were, necessarily, seen, as, belonging, together, it, is, only, as, recently, as, the, later, seventeenth, century, that, we, find, the, first, attempts, at, presenting, them, as, one, single, coherent, field, or, domain, and, at, explaining, what, they, have, in, common, in, short, western, esotericism, is, a, modern, scholarly, construct, not, an, autonomous, tradition, that, already, existed, out, there, and, merely, needed, to, be, discovered, by, historians, the, scholar, of, esotericism, wouter, hanegraaff, 2013, the, concept, of, western, esotericism, represents, a, modern, scholarly, construct, rather, than, a, pre, existing, self, defined, tradition, of, thought, in, the, late, 17th, century, several, european, christian, thinkers, presented, the, argument, that, one, could, categorise, certain, traditions, of, western, philosophy, and, thought, together, thus, establishing, the, category, now, labelled, western, esotericism, the, first, to, do, so, ehregott, daniel, colberg, 1659, 1698, a, german, lutheran, theologian, wrote, platonisch, hermetisches, christianity, 1690, 91, a, hostile, critic, of, various, currents, of, western, thought, that, had, emerged, since, the, renaissance, among, them, paracelsianism, weigelianism, and, christian, theosophy, in, his, book, he, labelled, all, of, these, traditions, under, the, category, of, platonic, hermetic, christianity, portraying, them, as, heretical, to, what, he, saw, as, true, christianity, despite, his, hostile, attitude, toward, these, traditions, of, thought, colberg, became, the, first, to, connect, these, disparate, philosophies, and, to, study, them, under, one, rubric, also, recognising, that, these, ideas, linked, back, to, earlier, philosophies, from, late, antiquity, in, 18th, century, europe, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, these, esoteric, traditions, came, to, be, regularly, categorised, under, the, labels, of, superstition, magic, and, the, occult, terms, often, used, interchangeably, the, modern, academy, then, in, the, process, of, developing, consistently, rejected, and, ignored, topics, coming, under, the, occult, thus, leaving, research, into, them, largely, to, enthusiasts, outside, of, academia, indeed, according, to, historian, of, esotericism, wouter, j, hanegraaff, born, 1961, rejection, of, occult, topics, was, seen, as, a, crucial, identity, marker, for, any, intellectuals, seeking, to, affiliate, themselves, with, the, academy, scholars, established, this, category, in, the, late, 18th, century, after, identifying, structural, similarities, between, the, ideas, and, world, views, of, a, wide, variety, of, thinkers, and, movements, that, previously, had, not, been, in, the, same, analytical, grouping, according, to, the, scholar, of, esotericism, wouter, j, hanegraaff, the, term, provided, a, useful, generic, label, for, a, large, and, complicated, group, of, historical, phenomena, that, had, long, been, perceived, as, sharing, an, air, de, famille, various, academics, have, emphasised, that, esotericism, is, a, phenomenon, unique, to, the, western, world, as, faivre, stated, an, empirical, perspective, would, hold, that, esotericism, is, a, western, notion, as, scholars, such, as, faivre, and, hanegraaff, have, pointed, out, there, is, no, comparable, category, of, eastern, or, oriental, esotericism, the, emphasis, on, western, esotericism, was, nevertheless, primarily, devised, to, distinguish, the, field, from, a, universal, esotericism, hanegraaff, has, characterised, these, as, recognisable, world, views, and, approaches, to, knowledge, that, have, played, an, important, though, always, controversial, role, in, the, history, of, western, culture, historian, of, religion, henrik, bogdan, asserted, that, western, esotericism, constituted, a, third, pillar, of, western, culture, alongside, doctrinal, faith, and, rationality, being, deemed, heretical, by, the, former, and, irrational, by, the, latter, scholars, nevertheless, recognise, that, various, non, western, traditions, have, exerted, a, profound, influence, over, western, esotericism, citing, the, example, of, the, theosophical, society, s, incorporation, of, hindu, and, buddhist, concepts, like, reincarnation, into, its, doctrines, given, these, influences, and, the, imprecise, nature, of, the, term, western, the, scholar, of, esotericism, kennet, granholm, has, argued, that, academics, should, cease, referring, to, western, esotericism, altogether, instead, simply, favouring, esotericism, as, a, descriptor, of, this, phenomenon, egil, asprem, has, endorsed, this, approach, the, historian, of, esotericism, antoine, faivre, noted, that, never, a, precise, term, has, begun, to, overflow, its, boundaries, on, all, sides, with, both, faivre, and, karen, claire, voss, stating, that, western, esotericism, consists, of, a, vast, spectrum, of, authors, trends, works, of, philosophy, religion, art, literature, and, music, scholars, broadly, agree, on, which, currents, of, thought, fall, within, a, category, of, esotericism, ranging, from, ancient, gnosticism, and, hermeticism, through, to, rosicrucianism, and, the, kabbalah, and, on, to, more, recent, phenomenon, such, as, the, new, age, movement, nevertheless, esotericism, itself, remains, a, controversial, term, with, scholars, specialising, in, the, subject, disagreeing, as, to, how, best, to, define, it, some, scholars, have, used, western, esotericism, to, refer, to, inner, traditions, concerned, with, a, universal, spiritual, dimension, of, reality, as, opposed, to, the, merely, external, exoteric, religious, institutions, and, dogmatic, systems, of, established, religions, this, approach, views, western, esotericism, as, just, one, variant, of, a, worldwide, esotericism, at, the, heart, of, all, world, religions, and, cultures, reflecting, a, hidden, esoteric, reality, this, use, is, closest, to, the, original, meaning, of, the, word, in, late, antiquity, where, it, applied, to, secret, spiritual, teachings, that, were, reserved, for, a, specific, elite, and, hidden, from, the, masses, this, definition, was, popularised, in, the, published, work, of, 19th, century, esotericists, like, a, e, waite, who, sought, to, combine, their, own, mystical, beliefs, with, a, historical, interpretation, of, esotericism, it, subsequently, became, a, popular, approach, within, several, esoteric, movements, most, notably, martinism, and, traditionalism, this, definition, originally, developed, by, esotericists, themselves, became, popular, among, french, academics, during, the, 1980s, exerting, a, strong, influence, over, the, scholars, mircea, eliade, henry, corbin, and, the, early, work, of, faivre, within, the, academic, field, of, religious, studies, those, who, study, different, religions, in, search, of, an, inner, universal, dimension, to, them, all, are, termed, religionists, such, religionist, ideas, also, exerted, an, influence, on, more, recent, scholars, like, nicholas, goodrick, clarke, and, arthur, versluis, versluis, for, instance, defined, western, esotericism, as, inner, or, hidden, spiritual, knowledge, transmitted, through, western, european, historical, currents, that, in, turn, feed, into, north, american, and, other, non, european, settings, he, added, that, these, western, esoteric, currents, all, shared, a, core, characteristic, a, claim, to, gnosis, or, direct, spiritual, insight, into, cosmology, or, spiritual, insight, and, accordingly, he, suggested, that, these, currents, could, be, referred, to, as, western, gnostic, just, as, much, as, western, esoteric, there, are, various, problems, with, this, model, for, understanding, western, esotericism, the, most, significant, is, that, it, rests, upon, the, conviction, that, there, really, is, a, universal, hidden, esoteric, dimension, of, reality, that, objectively, exists, the, existence, of, this, universal, inner, tradition, has, not, been, discovered, through, scientific, or, scholarly, enquiry, this, had, led, some, to, claim, that, it, does, not, exist, though, hanegraaff, thought, it, better, to, adopt, a, view, based, in, methodological, agnosticism, by, stating, that, we, simply, do, not, know, and, cannot, know, if, it, exists, or, not, he, noted, that, even, if, such, a, true, and, absolute, nature, of, reality, really, existed, it, would, only, be, accessible, through, esoteric, spiritual, practices, and, could, not, be, discovered, or, measured, by, the, exoteric, tools, of, scientific, and, scholarly, enquiry, hanegraaff, pointed, out, that, an, approach, that, seeks, a, common, inner, hidden, core, of, all, esoteric, currents, masks, that, such, groups, often, differ, greatly, being, rooted, in, their, own, historical, and, social, contexts, and, expressing, mutually, exclusive, ideas, and, agendas, a, third, issue, was, that, many, of, those, currents, widely, recognised, as, esoteric, never, concealed, their, teachings, and, in, the, 20th, century, came, to, permeate, popular, culture, thus, problematizing, the, claim, that, esotericism, could, be, defined, by, its, hidden, and, secretive, nature, he, noted, that, when, scholars, adopt, this, definition, it, shows, that, they, subscribe, to, the, religious, doctrines, espoused, by, the, very, groups, they, are, studying, another, approach, to, western, esotericism, treats, it, as, a, world, view, that, embraces, enchantment, in, contrast, to, world, views, influenced, by, post, cartesian, post, newtonian, and, positivist, science, that, sought, to, dis, enchant, the, world, that, approach, understands, esotericism, as, comprising, those, world, views, that, eschew, a, belief, in, instrumental, causality, and, instead, adopt, a, belief, that, all, parts, of, the, universe, are, interrelated, without, a, need, for, causal, chains, it, stands, as, a, radical, alternative, to, the, disenchanted, world, views, that, have, dominated, western, culture, since, the, scientific, revolution, and, must, therefore, always, be, at, odds, with, secular, culture, an, early, exponent, of, this, definition, was, the, historian, of, renaissance, thought, frances, yates, in, her, discussions, of, a, hermetic, tradition, which, she, saw, as, an, enchanted, alternative, to, established, religion, and, rationalistic, science, the, primary, exponent, of, this, view, was, faivre, who, published, a, series, of, criteria, for, how, to, define, western, esotericism, in, 1992, faivre, claimed, that, esotericism, was, identifiable, by, the, presence, of, six, fundamental, characteristics, or, components, four, of, which, were, intrinsic, and, thus, vital, to, defining, something, as, being, esoteric, while, the, other, two, were, secondary, and, thus, not, necessarily, present, in, every, form, of, esotericism, he, listed, these, characteristics, as, follows, faivre, s, form, of, categorisation, has, been, endorsed, by, scholars, like, goodrick, clarke, and, by, 2007, bogdan, could, note, that, faivre, s, had, become, the, standard, definition, of, western, esotericism, in, use, among, scholars, in, 2013, the, scholar, kennet, granholm, stated, only, that, faivre, s, definition, had, been, the, dominating, paradigm, for, a, long, while, and, that, it, still, exerts, influence, among, scholars, outside, the, study, of, western, esotericism, the, advantage, of, faivre, s, system, is, that, it, facilitates, comparing, varying, esoteric, traditions, with, one, another, in, a, systematic, fashion, other, scholars, criticised, his, theory, pointing, out, various, weaknesses, hanegraaff, claimed, that, faivre, s, approach, entailed, reasoning, by, prototype, in, that, it, relied, upon, already, having, a, best, example, of, what, western, esotericism, should, look, like, against, which, other, phenomena, then, had, to, be, compared, the, scholar, of, esotericism, kocku, von, stuckrad, born, 1966, noted, that, faivre, s, taxonomy, was, based, on, his, own, areas, of, specialism, renaissance, hermeticism, christian, kabbalah, and, protestant, theosophy, and, that, it, was, thus, not, based, on, a, wider, understanding, of, esotericism, as, it, has, existed, throughout, history, from, the, ancient, world, to, the, contemporary, period, accordingly, von, stuckrad, suggested, that, it, was, a, good, typology, for, understanding, christian, esotericism, in, the, early, modern, period, but, lacked, utility, beyond, that, somewhat, crudely, esotericism, can, be, described, as, a, western, form, of, spirituality, that, stresses, the, importance, of, the, individual, effort, to, gain, spiritual, knowledge, or, gnosis, whereby, man, is, confronted, with, the, divine, aspect, of, existence, historian, of, religion, henrik, bogdan, 2007, as, an, alternative, to, faivre, s, framework, kocku, von, stuckrad, developed, his, own, variant, though, he, argued, that, this, did, not, represent, a, definition, but, rather, a, framework, of, analysis, for, scholarly, usage, he, stated, that, on, the, most, general, level, of, analysis, esotericism, represented, the, claim, of, higher, knowledge, a, claim, to, possessing, wisdom, that, is, superior, to, other, interpretations, of, cosmos, and, history, that, serves, as, a, master, key, for, answering, all, questions, of, humankind, accordingly, he, believed, that, esoteric, groups, placed, a, great, emphasis, on, secrecy, not, because, they, were, inherently, rooted, in, elite, groups, but, because, the, idea, of, concealed, secrets, that, can, be, revealed, was, central, to, their, discourse, examining, the, means, of, accessing, higher, knowledge, he, highlighted, two, themes, that, he, believed, could, be, found, within, esotericism, that, of, mediation, through, contact, with, non, human, entities, and, individual, experience, accordingly, for, von, stuckrad, esotericism, could, be, best, understood, as, a, structural, element, of, western, culture, rather, than, as, a, selection, of, different, schools, of, thought, hanegraaff, proposed, an, additional, definition, that, western, esotericism, is, a, category, that, represents, the, academy, s, dustbin, of, rejected, knowledge, in, this, respect, it, contains, all, of, the, theories, and, world, views, rejected, by, the, mainstream, intellectual, community, because, they, do, not, accord, with, normative, conceptions, of, religion, rationality, and, science, his, approach, is, rooted, within, the, field, of, the, history, of, ideas, and, stresses, the, role, of, change, and, transformation, over, time, goodrick, clarke, was, critical, of, this, approach, believing, that, it, relegated, western, esotericism, to, the, position, of, a, casualty, of, positivist, and, materialist, perspectives, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, thus, reinforces, the, idea, that, western, esoteric, traditions, were, of, little, historical, importance, bogdan, similarly, expressed, concern, regarding, hanegraaff, s, definition, believing, that, it, made, the, category, of, western, esotericism, all, inclusive, and, thus, analytically, useless, the, origins, of, western, esotericism, are, in, the, hellenistic, eastern, mediterranean, then, part, of, the, roman, empire, during, late, antiquity, this, was, a, milieu, that, mixed, religious, and, intellectual, traditions, from, greece, egypt, the, levant, babylon, and, persia, in, which, globalisation, urbanisation, and, multiculturalism, were, bringing, about, socio, cultural, change, one, component, of, this, was, hermeticism, an, egyptian, hellenistic, school, of, thought, that, takes, its, name, from, the, legendary, egyptian, wise, man, hermes, trismegistus, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, a, number, of, texts, attributed, to, hermes, trismegistus, appeared, including, the, corpus, hermeticum, asclepius, and, the, discourse, on, the, eighth, and, ninth, some, still, debate, whether, hermeticism, was, a, purely, literary, phenomenon, or, had, communities, of, practitioners, who, acted, on, these, ideas, but, it, has, been, established, that, these, texts, discuss, the, true, nature, of, god, emphasising, that, humans, must, transcend, rational, thought, and, worldly, desires, to, find, salvation, and, be, reborn, into, a, spiritual, body, of, immaterial, light, thereby, achieving, spiritual, unity, with, divinity, another, tradition, of, esoteric, thought, in, late, antiquity, was, gnosticism, various, gnostic, sects, existed, and, they, broadly, believed, that, the, divine, light, had, been, imprisoned, within, the, material, world, by, a, malevolent, entity, known, as, the, demiurge, who, was, served, by, demonic, helpers, the, archons, it, was, the, gnostic, belief, that, people, who, were, imbued, with, the, divine, light, should, seek, to, attain, gnosis, and, thus, escape, from, the, world, of, matter, and, rejoin, the, divine, source, a, third, form, of, esotericism, in, late, antiquity, was, neoplatonism, a, school, of, thought, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, the, philosopher, plato, advocated, by, such, figures, as, plotinus, porphyry, iamblichus, and, proclus, neoplatonism, held, that, the, human, soul, had, fallen, from, its, divine, origins, into, the, material, world, but, that, it, could, progress, through, a, number, of, hierarchical, spheres, of, being, to, return, to, its, divine, origins, once, more, the, later, neoplatonists, performed, theurgy, a, ritual, practice, attested, in, such, sources, as, the, chaldean, oracles, scholars, are, still, unsure, of, precisely, what, theurgy, involved, but, know, it, involved, a, practice, designed, to, make, gods, appear, who, could, then, raise, the, theurgist, s, mind, to, the, reality, of, the, divine, after, the, fall, of, rome, alchemy, and, philosophy, and, other, aspects, of, the, tradition, were, largely, preserved, in, the, arab, and, near, eastern, world, and, reintroduced, into, western, europe, by, jews, and, by, the, cultural, contact, between, christians, and, muslims, in, sicily, and, southern, italy, the, 12th, century, saw, the, development, of, the, kabbalah, in, southern, italy, and, medieval, spain, the, medieval, period, also, saw, the, publication, of, grimoires, which, offered, often, elaborate, formulas, for, theurgy, and, thaumaturgy, many, of, the, grimoires, seem, to, have, kabbalistic, influence, figures, in, alchemy, from, this, period, seem, to, also, have, authored, or, used, grimoires, medieval, sects, deemed, heretical, such, as, the, waldensians, were, thought, to, have, utilized, esoteric, concepts, during, the, renaissance, a, number, of, european, thinkers, began, to, synthesize, pagan, that, is, not, christian, philosophies, which, were, then, being, made, available, through, arabic, translations, with, christian, thought, and, the, jewish, kabbalah, the, earliest, of, these, individuals, was, the, byzantine, philosopher, plethon, 1355, 60, 1452, who, argued, that, the, chaldean, oracles, represented, an, example, of, a, superior, religion, of, ancient, humanity, that, had, been, passed, down, by, the, platonists, plethon, s, ideas, interested, the, ruler, of, florence, cosimo, de, medici, who, employed, florentine, thinker, marsilio, ficino, 1433, 1499, to, translate, plato, s, works, into, latin, ficino, went, on, to, translate, and, publish, the, works, of, various, platonic, figures, arguing, that, their, philosophies, were, compatible, with, christianity, and, allowing, for, the, emergence, of, a, wider, movement, in, renaissance, platonism, or, platonic, orientalism, ficino, also, translated, part, of, the, corpus, hermeticum, though, the, rest, was, translated, by, his, contemporary, lodovico, lazzarelli, 1447, 1500, another, core, figure, in, this, intellectual, milieu, was, giovanni, pico, della, mirandola, 1463, 1494, who, achieved, notability, in, 1486, by, inviting, scholars, from, across, europe, to, come, and, debate, with, him, 900, theses, that, he, had, written, pico, della, mirandola, argued, that, all, of, these, philosophies, reflected, a, grand, universal, wisdom, pope, innocent, viii, condemned, these, ideas, criticising, him, for, attempting, to, mix, pagan, and, jewish, ideas, with, christianity, pico, della, mirandola, s, increased, interest, in, jewish, kabbalah, led, to, his, development, of, a, distinct, form, of, christian, kabbalah, his, work, was, built, on, by, the, german, johannes, reuchlin, 1455, 1522, who, authored, an, influential, text, on, the, subject, de, arte, cabalistica, christian, kabbalah, was, expanded, in, the, work, of, the, german, heinrich, cornelius, agrippa, 1486, 1535, 36, who, used, it, as, a, framework, to, explore, the, philosophical, and, scientific, traditions, of, antiquity, in, his, work, de, occulta, philosophia, libri, tres, the, work, of, agrippa, and, other, esoteric, philosophers, had, been, based, in, a, pre, copernican, worldview, but, following, the, arguments, of, copernicus, a, more, accurate, understanding, of, the, cosmos, was, established, copernicus, theories, were, adopted, into, esoteric, strains, of, thought, by, giordano, bruno, 1548, 1600, whose, ideas, were, deemed, heresy, by, the, roman, catholic, church, which, eventually, publicly, executed, him, a, distinct, strain, of, esoteric, thought, developed, in, germany, where, it, became, known, as, naturphilosophie, though, influenced, by, traditions, from, late, antiquity, and, medieval, kabbalah, it, only, acknowledged, two, main, sources, of, authority, biblical, scripture, and, the, natural, world, the, primary, exponent, of, this, approach, was, paracelsus, 1493, 94, 1541, who, took, inspiration, from, alchemy, and, folk, magic, to, argue, against, the, mainstream, medical, establishment, of, his, time, which, as, in, antiquity, still, based, its, approach, on, the, ideas, of, the, second, century, physician, and, philosopher, galen, a, greek, in, the, roman, empire, instead, paracelsus, urged, doctors, to, learn, medicine, through, an, observation, of, the, natural, world, though, in, later, work, he, also, began, to, focus, on, overtly, religious, questions, his, work, gained, significant, support, in, both, areas, over, the, following, centuries, one, of, those, influenced, by, paracelsus, was, the, german, cobbler, jakob, b, hme, 1575, 1624, who, sparked, the, christian, theosophy, movement, through, his, attempts, to, solve, the, problem, of, evil, b, hme, argued, that, god, had, been, created, out, of, an, unfathomable, mystery, the, ungrund, and, that, god, himself, was, composed, of, a, wrathful, core, surrounded, by, the, forces, of, light, and, love, though, condemned, by, germany, s, lutheran, authorities, b, hme, s, ideas, spread, and, formed, the, basis, for, a, number, of, small, religious, communities, such, as, johann, georg, gichtel, s, angelic, brethren, in, amsterdam, and, john, pordage, and, jane, leade, s, philadelphian, society, in, england, from, 1614, to, 1616, the, three, rosicrucian, manifestos, were, published, in, germany, these, texts, purported, to, represent, a, secret, initiatory, brotherhood, founded, centuries, before, by, a, german, adept, named, christian, rosenkreutz, there, is, no, evidence, that, rosenkreutz, was, a, genuine, historical, figure, nor, that, a, rosicrucian, order, had, ever, existed, before, then, instead, the, manifestos, are, likely, literary, creations, of, lutheran, theologian, johann, valentin, andreae, 1586, 1654, they, interested, the, public, so, several, people, described, themselves, as, rosicrucian, claiming, access, to, secret, esoteric, knowledge, a, real, initiatory, brotherhood, was, established, in, late, 16th, century, scotland, through, the, transformation, of, medieval, stonemason, guilds, to, include, non, craftsmen, freemasonry, soon, spreading, into, other, parts, of, europe, in, england, it, largely, rejected, its, esoteric, character, and, embraced, humanism, and, rationalism, while, in, france, it, embraced, new, esoteric, concepts, particularly, those, from, christian, theosophy, the, age, of, enlightenment, witnessed, a, process, of, increasing, secularisation, of, european, governments, and, an, embrace, of, modern, science, and, rationality, within, intellectual, circles, in, turn, a, modernist, occult, emerged, that, reflected, varied, ways, esoteric, thinkers, came, to, terms, with, these, developments, one, of, the, esotericists, of, this, period, was, the, swedish, naturalist, emanuel, swedenborg, 1688, 1772, who, attempted, to, reconcile, science, and, religion, after, experiencing, a, vision, of, jesus, christ, his, writings, focused, on, his, visionary, travels, to, heaven, and, hell, and, his, communications, with, angels, claiming, that, the, visible, materialist, world, parallels, an, invisible, spiritual, world, with, correspondences, between, the, two, that, do, not, reflect, causal, relations, following, his, death, followers, founded, the, swedenborgian, new, church, though, his, writings, influenced, a, wider, array, of, esoteric, philosophies, another, major, figure, within, the, esoteric, movement, of, this, period, was, the, german, physician, franz, anton, mesmer, 1734, 1814, who, developed, the, theory, of, animal, magnetism, which, later, became, known, more, commonly, as, mesmerism, mesmer, claimed, that, a, universal, life, force, permeated, everything, including, the, human, body, and, that, illnesses, were, caused, by, a, disturbance, or, block, in, this, force, s, flow, he, developed, techniques, he, claimed, cleansed, such, blockages, and, restored, the, patient, to, full, health, one, of, mesmer, s, followers, the, marquis, de, puys, gur, discovered, that, mesmeric, treatment, could, induce, a, state, of, somnumbulic, trance, in, which, they, claimed, to, enter, visionary, states, and, communicate, with, spirit, beings, these, somnambulic, trance, states, heavily, influenced, the, esoteric, religion, of, spiritualism, which, emerged, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1840s, and, spread, throughout, north, america, and, europe, spiritualism, was, based, on, the, concept, that, individuals, could, communicate, with, spirits, of, the, deceased, during, s, ances, most, forms, of, spiritualism, had, little, theoretical, depth, being, largely, practical, affairs, but, full, theological, worldviews, based, on, the, movement, were, articulated, by, andrew, jackson, davis, 1826, 1910, and, allan, kardec, 1804, 1869, scientific, interest, in, the, claims, of, spiritualism, resulted, in, the, development, of, the, field, of, psychical, research, somnambulism, also, exerted, a, strong, influence, on, the, early, disciplines, of, psychology, and, psychiatry, esoteric, ideas, pervade, the, work, of, many, early, figures, in, this, field, most, notably, carl, gustav, jung, though, with, the, rise, of, psychoanalysis, and, behaviourism, in, the, 20th, century, these, disciplines, distanced, themselves, from, esotericism, also, influenced, by, artificial, somnambulism, was, the, religion, of, new, thought, founded, by, the, american, mesmerist, phineas, p, quimby, 1802, 1866, it, revolved, around, the, concept, of, mind, over, matter, believing, that, illness, and, other, negative, conditions, could, be, cured, through, the, power, of, belief, in, europe, a, movement, usually, termed, occultism, emerged, as, various, figures, attempted, to, find, a, third, way, between, christianity, and, positivist, science, while, building, on, the, ancient, medieval, and, renaissance, traditions, of, esoteric, thought, in, france, following, the, social, upheaval, of, the, 1789, revolution, various, figures, emerged, in, this, occultist, milieu, who, were, heavily, influenced, by, traditional, catholicism, the, most, notable, of, whom, were, liphas, l, vi, 1810, 1875, and, papus, 1865, 1916, also, significant, was, ren, gu, non, 1886, 1951, whose, concern, with, tradition, led, him, to, develop, an, occult, viewpoint, termed, traditionalism, it, espoused, the, idea, of, an, original, universal, tradition, and, thus, a, rejection, of, modernity, his, traditionalist, ideas, strongly, influenced, later, esotericists, like, julius, evola, 1898, 1974, founder, of, the, ur, group, and, frithjof, schuon, 1907, 1998, in, the, anglophone, world, the, burgeoning, occult, movement, owed, more, to, enlightenment, libertines, and, thus, was, more, often, of, an, anti, christian, bent, that, saw, wisdom, as, emanating, from, the, pre, christian, pagan, religions, of, europe, various, spiritualist, mediums, came, to, be, disillusioned, with, the, esoteric, thought, available, and, sought, inspiration, in, pre, swedenborgian, currents, including, emma, hardinge, britten, 1823, 1899, and, helena, blavatsky, 1831, 1891, the, latter, of, whom, called, for, the, revival, of, the, occult, science, of, the, ancients, which, could, be, found, in, both, the, east, and, west, authoring, the, influential, isis, unveiled, 1877, and, the, secret, doctrine, 1888, she, co, founded, the, theosophical, society, in, 1875, subsequent, leaders, of, the, society, namely, annie, besant, 1847, 1933, and, charles, webster, leadbeater, 1854, 1934, interpreted, modern, theosophy, as, a, form, of, ecumenical, esoteric, christianity, resulting, in, their, proclamation, of, indian, jiddu, krishnamurti, 1895, 1986, as, world, messiah, in, rejection, of, this, was, the, breakaway, anthroposophical, society, founded, by, rudolf, steiner, 1861, 1925, according, to, maria, carlson, both, turned, out, to, be, positivistic, religions, offering, a, seemingly, logical, theology, based, on, pseudoscience, another, form, of, esoteric, christianity, is, the, spiritual, science, of, the, danish, mystic, martinus, 1890, 1981, who, is, popular, in, scandinavia, new, esoteric, understandings, of, magic, also, developed, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, one, of, the, pioneers, of, this, was, american, paschal, beverly, randolph, 1825, 1875, who, argued, that, sexual, energy, and, psychoactive, drugs, could, be, used, for, magical, purposes, in, england, the, hermetic, order, of, the, golden, dawn, an, initiatory, order, devoted, to, magic, based, on, kabbalah, was, founded, in, the, latter, years, of, the, century, one, of, the, members, of, that, order, was, aleister, crowley, 1875, 1947, who, went, on, to, proclaim, the, religion, of, thelema, and, become, a, member, of, ordo, templi, orientis, some, of, their, contemporaries, developed, esoteric, schools, of, thought, that, did, not, entail, magic, namely, the, greco, armenian, teacher, george, gurdjieff, 1866, 1949, and, his, russian, pupil, p, d, ouspensky, 1878, 1947, emergent, occult, and, esoteric, systems, found, increasing, popularity, in, the, early, 20th, century, especially, in, western, europe, occult, lodges, and, secret, societies, flowered, among, european, intellectuals, of, this, era, who, had, largely, abandoned, traditional, forms, of, christianity, the, spreading, of, secret, teachings, and, magical, practices, found, enthusiastic, adherents, in, the, chaos, of, germany, during, the, interwar, years, notable, writers, such, as, guido, von, list, spread, neo, pagan, nationalist, ideas, based, on, wotanism, and, the, kabbalah, many, influential, and, wealthy, germans, were, drawn, to, secret, societies, such, as, the, thule, society, thule, society, activist, karl, harrer, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, german, workers, party, which, later, became, the, nazi, party, some, nazi, party, members, like, alfred, rosenberg, and, rudolf, hess, were, listed, as, guests, of, the, thule, society, as, was, adolf, hitler, s, mentor, dietrich, eckart, after, their, rise, to, power, the, nazis, persecuted, occultists, while, many, nazi, party, leaders, like, hitler, and, joseph, goebbels, were, hostile, to, occultism, heinrich, himmler, used, karl, maria, wiligut, as, a, clairvoyant, and, was, regularly, consulting, for, help, in, setting, up, the, symbolic, and, ceremonial, aspects, of, the, ss, but, not, for, important, political, decisions, by, 1939, wiligut, was, forcibly, retired, from, the, ss, due, to, being, institutionalised, for, insanity, on, the, other, hand, the, german, hermetic, magic, order, fraternitas, saturni, was, founded, on, easter, 1928, and, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, continuously, running, magical, groups, in, germany, in, 1936, the, fraternitas, saturni, was, prohibited, by, the, nazi, regime, the, leaders, of, the, lodge, emigrated, to, avoid, imprisonment, but, in, the, course, of, the, war, eugen, grosche, one, of, their, main, leaders, was, arrested, for, a, year, by, the, nazi, government, after, world, war, ii, they, reformed, the, fraternitas, saturni, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, esotericism, came, to, be, increasingly, associated, with, the, growing, counter, culture, in, the, west, whose, adherents, understood, themselves, in, participating, in, a, spiritual, revolution, that, marked, the, age, of, aquarius, by, the, 1980s, these, millenarian, currents, had, come, to, be, widely, known, as, the, new, age, movement, and, it, became, increasingly, commercialised, as, business, entrepreneurs, exploited, a, growth, in, the, spiritual, market, conversely, other, forms, of, esoteric, thought, retained, the, anti, commercial, and, counter, cultural, sentiment, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, namely, the, techno, shamanic, movement, promoted, by, figures, such, as, terence, mckenna, and, daniel, pinchbeck, which, built, on, the, work, of, anthropologist, carlos, castaneda, this, trend, was, accompanied, by, the, increased, growth, of, modern, paganism, a, movement, initially, dominated, by, wicca, the, religion, propagated, by, gerald, gardner, wicca, was, adopted, by, members, of, the, second, wave, feminist, movement, most, notably, starhawk, and, developing, into, the, goddess, movement, wicca, also, greatly, influenced, the, development, of, pagan, neo, druidry, and, other, forms, of, celtic, revivalism, in, response, to, wicca, there, has, also, appeared, literature, and, groups, who, label, themselves, followers, of, traditional, witchcraft, in, opposition, to, the, growing, visibility, of, wicca, and, these, claim, older, roots, than, the, system, proposed, by, gardner, other, trends, that, emerged, in, western, occultism, in, the, later, 20th, century, included, satanism, as, exposed, by, groups, such, as, the, church, of, satan, and, temple, of, set, as, well, as, chaos, magick, through, the, illuminates, of, thanateros, group, additionally, since, the, start, of, the, 1990s, countries, inside, of, the, former, iron, curtain, have, undergone, a, radiative, and, varied, religious, revival, with, a, large, number, of, occult, and, new, religious, movements, gaining, popularity, gnostic, revivalists, new, age, organizations, and, scientology, splinter, groups, have, found, their, way, into, much, of, the, former, soviet, bloc, since, the, cultural, and, political, shift, resulting, from, the, dissolution, of, the, ussr, in, hungary, a, significant, number, of, citizens, relative, to, the, size, of, the, country, s, population, and, compared, to, its, neighbors, practice, or, adhere, to, new, currents, of, western, esotericism, in, april, 1997, the, fifth, esoteric, spiritual, forum, was, held, for, two, days, in, the, country, and, was, attended, at, capacity, in, august, of, the, same, year, the, international, shaman, expo, began, being, broadcast, on, live, tv, and, ultimately, taking, place, for, two, months, wherein, various, neo, shamanist, millenarian, mystic, neo, pagan, and, even, ufo, religion, congregations, and, figures, were, among, the, attendees, the, academic, study, of, western, esotericism, was, pioneered, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, historians, of, the, ancient, world, and, the, european, renaissance, who, came, to, recognise, that, even, though, previous, scholarship, had, ignored, it, the, effect, of, pre, christian, and, non, rational, schools, of, thought, on, european, society, and, culture, was, worthy, of, academic, attention, one, of, the, key, centres, for, this, was, the, warburg, institute, in, london, where, scholars, like, frances, yates, edgar, wind, ernst, cassirer, and, d, p, walker, began, arguing, that, esoteric, thought, had, had, a, greater, effect, on, renaissance, culture, than, had, been, previously, accepted, the, work, of, yates, in, particular, most, notably, her, 1964, book, giordano, bruno, and, the, hermetic, tradition, has, been, cited, as, an, important, starting, point, for, modern, scholarship, on, esotericism, succeeding, at, one, fell, swoop, in, bringing, scholarship, onto, a, new, track, by, bringing, wider, awareness, of, the, effect, that, esoteric, ideas, had, on, modern, science, in, 1965, at, the, instigation, of, the, scholar, henry, corbin, cole, pratique, des, hautes, tudes, in, the, sorbonne, established, the, world, s, first, academic, post, in, the, study, of, esotericism, with, a, chair, in, the, history, of, christian, esotericism, its, first, holder, was, fran, ois, secret, a, specialist, in, the, christian, kabbalah, though, he, had, little, interest, in, developing, the, wider, study, of, esotericism, as, a, field, of, research, in, 1979, faivre, assumed, secret, s, chair, at, the, sorbonne, which, was, renamed, the, history, of, esoteric, and, mystical, currents, in, modern, and, contemporary, europe, faivre, has, since, been, cited, as, being, responsible, for, developing, the, study, of, western, esotericism, into, a, formalised, field, with, his, 1992, work, l, sot, risme, having, been, cited, as, marking, the, beginning, of, the, study, of, western, esotericism, as, an, academic, field, of, research, he, remained, in, the, chair, until, 2002, when, he, was, succeeded, by, jean, pierre, brach, faivre, noted, two, significant, obstacles, to, establishing, the, field, one, was, an, ingrained, prejudice, toward, esotericism, within, academia, resulting, in, the, widespread, perception, that, the, history, of, esotericism, was, not, worthy, of, academic, research, the, other, was, esotericism, s, status, as, a, trans, disciplinary, field, the, study, of, which, did, not, fit, clearly, within, any, particular, discipline, as, hanegraaff, noted, western, esotericism, had, to, be, studied, as, a, separate, field, to, religion, philosophy, science, and, the, arts, because, while, it, participates, in, all, these, fields, it, does, not, squarely, fit, into, any, of, them, elsewhere, he, noted, that, there, was, probably, no, other, domain, in, the, humanities, that, has, been, so, seriously, neglected, as, western, esotericism, in, 1980, the, u, s, based, hermetic, academy, was, founded, by, robert, a, mcdermott, as, an, outlet, for, american, scholars, interested, in, western, esotericism, from, 1986, to, 1990, members, of, the, hermetic, academy, participated, in, panels, at, the, annual, meeting, of, the, american, academy, of, religion, under, the, rubric, of, the, esotericism, and, perennialism, group, by, 1994, faivre, could, comment, that, the, academic, study, of, western, esotericism, had, taken, off, in, france, italy, england, and, the, united, states, but, he, lamented, that, it, had, not, done, so, in, germany, in, 1999, the, university, of, amsterdam, established, a, chair, in, the, history, of, hermetic, philosophy, and, related, currents, which, was, occupied, by, hanegraaff, while, in, 2005, the, university, of, exeter, created, a, chair, in, western, esotericism, which, was, taken, by, goodrick, clarke, who, headed, the, exeter, center, for, the, study, of, esotericism, thus, by, 2008, there, were, three, dedicated, university, chairs, in, the, subject, with, amsterdam, and, exeter, also, offering, master, s, degree, programs, in, it, several, conferences, on, the, subject, were, held, at, the, quintennial, meetings, of, the, international, association, for, the, history, of, religions, while, a, peer, reviewed, journal, aries, journal, for, the, study, of, western, esotericism, began, publication, in, 2001, 2001, also, saw, the, foundation, of, the, north, american, association, for, the, study, of, esotericism, ase, with, the, european, society, for, the, study, of, western, esotericism, esswe, being, established, shortly, after, within, a, few, years, michael, bergunder, expressed, the, view, that, it, had, become, an, established, field, within, religious, studies, with, asprem, and, granholm, observing, that, scholars, within, other, sub, disciplines, of, religious, studies, had, begun, to, take, an, interest, in, the, work, of, scholars, of, esotericism, asprem, and, granholm, noted, that, the, study, of, esotericism, had, been, dominated, by, historians, and, thus, lacked, the, perspective, of, social, scientists, examining, contemporary, forms, of, esotericism, a, situation, that, they, were, attempting, to, correct, through, building, links, with, scholars, operating, in, pagan, studies, and, the, study, of, new, religious, movements, on, the, basis, that, english, culture, and, literature, have, been, traditional, strongholds, of, western, esotericism, in, 2011, pia, br, nzeu, and, gy, rgy, sz, nyi, urged, that, english, studies, also, have, a, role, in, this, interdisciplinary, field, emic, and, etic, refer, to, two, kinds, of, field, research, done, and, viewpoints, obtained, emic, from, within, the, social, group, from, the, perspective, of, the, subject, and, etic, from, outside, from, the, perspective, of, the, observer, wouter, hanegraaff, follows, a, distinction, between, an, emic, and, an, etic, approach, to, religious, studies, the, emic, approach, is, that, of, the, alchemist, or, theosopher, the, etic, approach, is, that, of, the, scholar, as, an, historian, a, researcher, with, a, critical, view, an, empirical, study, of, esotericism, needs, emic, material, and, etic, interpretation, emic, denotes, the, believer, s, point, of, view, on, the, part, of, the, researcher, the, reconstruction, of, this, emic, perspective, requires, an, attitude, of, empathy, which, excludes, personal, biases, as, far, as, possible, scholarly, discourse, about, religion, on, the, other, hand, is, not, emic, but, etic, scholars, may, introduce, their, own, terminology, and, make, theoretical, distinctions, which, are, different, from, those, of, the, believers, themselves, arthur, versluis, proposes, approaching, esotericism, through, an, imaginative, participation, esotericism, given, all, its, varied, forms, and, its, inherently, multidimensional, nature, cannot, be, conveyed, without, going, beyond, purely, historical, information, at, minimum, the, study, of, esotericism, and, in, particular, mysticism, requires, some, degree, of, imaginative, participation, in, what, one, is, studying, many, scholars, of, esotericism, have, come, to, be, regarded, as, respected, intellectual, authorities, by, practitioners, of, various, esoteric, traditions, many, esotericism, scholars, have, sought, to, emphasise, that, esotericism, is, not, a, single, object, but, practitioners, who, read, this, scholarship, have, begun, to, regard, it, and, think, of, it, as, a, singular, object, with, which, they, affiliate, themselves, thus, asprem, and, granholm, noted, that, the, use, of, the, term, esotericism, among, scholars, significantly, contributes, to, the, reification, of, the, category, for, the, general, audience, despite, the, explicated, contrary, intentions, of, most, scholars, in, the, field, in, 2013, asprem, and, granholm, highlighted, that, contemporary, esotericism, is, intimately, and, increasingly, connected, with, popular, culture, and, new, media, granholm, noted, that, esoteric, ideas, and, images, appear, in, many, aspects, of, western, popular, media, citing, such, examples, as, buffy, the, vampire, slayer, avatar, hellblazer, and, his, dark, materials, granholm, has, argued, that, there, are, problems, with, the, field, in, that, it, draws, a, distinction, between, esotericism, and, non, esoteric, elements, of, culture, that, draw, upon, esotericism, he, cites, extreme, metal, as, an, example, noting, that, it, is, extremely, difficult, to, differentiate, between, artists, who, were, properly, occult, and, those, who, superficially, referenced, occult, themes, and, aesthetics, writers, interested, in, occult, themes, have, adopted, three, different, strategies, for, dealing, with, the, subject, those, who, are, knowledgeable, on, the, subject, including, attractive, images, of, the, occult, and, occultists, in, their, work, those, who, disguise, occultism, within, a, web, of, intertextuality, and, those, who, oppose, it, and, seek, to, deconstruct, it
