catholic, churches, which, are, in, communion, with, rome, and, maintain, eastern, liturgies, and, the, eastern, protestant, churches, most, eastern, churches, do, not, normally, refer, to, themselves, as, eastern, with, the, exception, of, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, and, its, offshoot, the, ancient, church, of, the, east, the, eastern, orthodox, are, the, largest, body, within, eastern, christianity, with, a, worldwide, population, of, 220, million, followed, by, the, oriental, orthodox, at, 60, million, the, eastern, catholic, churches, consist, of, about, 16, 18,

centered, in, constantinople, in, contrast, with, the, western, latin, church, centered, on, rome, which, uses, the, latin, liturgical, rites, the, terms, eastern, and, western, in, this, regard, originated, with, geographical, divisions, in, christianity, mirroring, the, cultural, divide, between, the, hellenistic, east, and, the, latin, west, and, the, political, divide, of, 395, ad, between, the, western, and, eastern, roman, empires, since, the, protestant, reformation, of, the, 16th, century, the, term, eastern, christianity, may, be, used, in, contrast, with, western, christianity, which, contains, not, only, the, latin, church, but, also, forms, of, protestantism, and, independent, catholicism, some, eastern, churches, have, more, in, common, historically, and, theologically, with, western, christianity, than, with, one, another, because, the, largest, church, in, the, east, is, the, body, currently, known, as, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, term, orthodox, is, often, used, in, a, similar, fashion, to, eastern, to, refer, to, specific, historical, christian, communions, however, strictly, speaking, most, christian, denominations, whether, eastern, or, western, regard, themselves, as, orthodox, meaning, following, correct, beliefs, as, well, as, catholic, meaning, universal, and, as, sharing, in, the, four, marks, of, the, church, listed, in, the, nicene, constantinopolitan, creed, 381, ad, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, greek, eastern, churches, excepting, the, non, liturgical, dissenting, bodies, utilize, several,

the, antiochian, rite, eastern, christians, do, not, all, share, the, same, religious, traditions, but, many, do, share, cultural, traditions, christianity, divided, itself, in, the, east, during, its, early, centuries, both, within, and, outside, of, the, roman, empire, in, disputes, about, christology, and, fundamental, theology, as, well, as, through, national, divisions, roman, persian, etc, it, would, be, many, centuries, later, that, western, christianity, fully, split, from, these, traditions, as, its, own, communion, major, branches, or, families, of, eastern, christianity, each, holding, a, distinct, theology, and, dogma, include, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, oriental, orthodox, communion, the, eastern, catholic, churches, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, in, most, eastern, churches, parish, priests, administer, the, sacrament, of, chrismation, to, infants, after, baptism, and, priests, are, allowed, to, marry, before, ordination, the, eastern, catholic, churches, recognize, the, authority, of, the, pope, of, rome, but, some, of, them, who, have, originally, been, part, of, the, orthodox, church, or, oriental, orthodox, churches, closely, follow, the, traditions, of, orthodoxy, or, oriental, orthodoxy, including, the, tradition, of, allowing, married, men, to, become, priests, the, eastern, churches, differences, from, western, christianity, have, to, do, with, theology, as, well, as, liturgy, culture, language, and, politics, for, the, non, catholic, eastern, churches, a, definitive, date, for, the, commencement, of, schism, cannot, usually, be, given, see, east, west, schism, the, church, of, the, east, declared, independence, from, the, churches, of, the, roman, empire, at, its, general, council, in, 424, which, was, before, the, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, and, so, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, theology, declared, at, that, council, oriental, orthodoxy, separated, after, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, 451, but, did, not, immediately, form, separate, patriarchates, until, 518, in, the, case, of, the, syriac, patriarchate, of, antioch, and, 536, in, the, case, of, the, coptic, patriarchate, of, alexandria, since, the, time, of, the, historian, edward, gibbon, the, split, between, the, church, of, rome, and, the, orthodox, church, has, been, conveniently, dated, to, 1054, though, the, reality, is, more, complex, this, split, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, great, schism, but, is, now, more, usually, called, the, east, west, schism, this, final, schism, reflected, a, larger, cultural, and, political, division, which, had, developed, in, europe, and, southwest, asia, during, the, middle, ages, and, coincided, with, western, europe, s, re, emergence, from, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, ukrainian, lutheran, church, developed, within, galicia, around, 1926, with, its, rites, being, based, on, the, liturgy, of, saint, john, chrysostom, rather, than, on, the, western, formula, missae, the, eastern, orthodox, church, is, a, christian, body, whose, adherents, are, largely, based, in, western, asia, particularly, syria, lebanon, jordan, israel, and, palestine, and, turkey, eastern, europe, the, balkans, and, the, caucasus, georgia, abkhazia, ossetia, etc, with, a, growing, presence, in, the, western, world, eastern, orthodox, christians, accept, the, decisions, of, the, first, seven, ecumenical, councils, eastern, orthodox, christianity, identifies, itself, as, the, original, christian, church, see, early, centers, of, christianity, founded, by, christ, and, the, apostles, and, traces, its, lineage, back, to, the, early, church, through, the, process, of, apostolic, succession, and, unchanged, theology, and, practice, characteristics, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, include, the, byzantine, rite, shared, with, some, eastern, catholic, churches, and, an, emphasis, on, the, continuation, of, holy, tradition, which, it, holds, to, be, apostolic, in, nature, the, eastern, orthodox, church, is, organized, into, self, governing, jurisdictions, along, geographical, national, ethnic, or, linguistic, lines, eastern, orthodoxy, is, thus, made, up, of, fourteen, or, sixteen, autocephalous, bodies, smaller, churches, are, autonomous, and, each, have, a, mother, church, that, is, autocephalous, all, eastern, orthodox, are, united, in, doctrinal, agreement, with, each, other, though, a, few, are, not, in, communion, at, present, for, non, doctrinal, reasons, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, catholic, church, and, its, various, churches, members, of, the, latter, are, all, in, communion, with, each, other, parts, of, a, top, down, hierarchy, see, primus, inter, pares, the, eastern, orthodox, reject, the, filioque, clause, as, contrast, to, catholics, the, catholic, church, was, once, in, communion, with, the, eastern, orthodox, church, but, the, two, split, after, the, east, west, schism, and, are, no, longer, in, communion, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, approximately, 240, million, eastern, orthodox, christians, in, the, world, today, many, adherents, shun, the, term, eastern, as, denying, the, church, s, universal, character, they, refer, to, eastern, orthodoxy, simply, as, the, orthodox, church, oriental, orthodoxy, refers, to, the, churches, of, eastern, christian, tradition, that, keep, the, faith, of, the, first, three, ecumenical, councils, of, the, undivided, christian, church, the, first, council, of, nicaea, ad, 325, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, and, the, council, of, ephesus, 431, while, rejecting, the, dogmatic, definitions, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, 451, hence, these, churches, are, also, called, the, old, oriental, churches, they, comprise, the, coptic, orthodox, church, the, malankara, orthodox, church, india, the, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, the, syriac, orthodox, church, and, the, armenian, apostolic, church, oriental, orthodoxy, developed, in, reaction, to, chalcedon, on, the, eastern, limit, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, in, egypt, syria, and, mesopotamia, in, those, locations, there, are, also, eastern, orthodox, patriarchs, but, the, rivalry, between, the, two, has, largely, vanished, in, the, centuries, since, the, schism, historically, the, church, of, the, east, was, the, widest, reaching, branch, of, eastern, christianity, at, its, height, spreading, from, its, heartland, in, persian, ruled, assyria, to, the, mediterranean, india, and, china, originally, the, only, christian, church, recognized, by, zoroastrian, led, sassanid, persia, through, its, alliance, with, the, lakhmids, the, regional, rivals, to, the, byzantines, and, its, ghassanid, vassal, the, church, of, the, east, declared, itself, independent, of, other, churches, in, 424, and, over, the, next, century, became, affiliated, with, nestorianism, a, christological, doctrine, advanced, by, nestorius, patriarch, of, constantinople, from, 428, to, 431, which, had, been, declared, heretical, in, the, roman, empire, thereafter, it, was, often, known, in, the, west, possibly, inaccurately, as, the, nestorian, church, surviving, a, period, of, persecution, within, persia, the, church, of, the, east, flourished, under, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, branched, out, establishing, dioceses, throughout, asia, after, another, period, of, expansion, under, the, mongol, empire, the, church, went, into, decline, starting, in, the, 14th, century, and, was, eventually, largely, confined, to, its, founding, assyrian, adherent, s, heartland, in, the, assyrian, homeland, although, another, remnant, survived, on, the, malabar, coast, of, india, in, the, 16th, century, dynastic, struggles, sent, the, church, into, schism, resulting, in, the, formation, of, two, rival, churches, the, chaldean, catholic, church, which, entered, into, communion, with, rome, as, an, eastern, catholic, church, and, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, followers, of, these, two, churches, are, almost, exclusively, ethnic, assyrians, in, india, the, local, church, of, the, east, community, known, as, the, saint, thomas, christians, experienced, its, own, rifts, as, a, result, of, portuguese, influence, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, emerged, from, the, historical, church, of, the, east, which, was, centered, in, mesopotamia, assyria, then, part, of, the, persian, empire, and, spread, widely, throughout, asia, the, modern, assyrian, church, of, the, east, emerged, in, the, 16th, century, following, a, split, with, the, chaldean, church, which, later, entered, into, communion, with, rome, as, an, eastern, catholic, church, the, church, of, the, east, was, associated, with, the, doctrine, of, nestorianism, advanced, by, nestorius, patriarch, of, constantinople, from, 428, to, 431, which, emphasized, the, disunion, between, the, human, and, divine, natures, of, jesus, nestorius, and, his, doctrine, were, condemned, at, the, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, leading, to, the, nestorian, schism, in, which, churches, supporting, nestorius, split, from, the, rest, of, christianity, many, followers, relocated, to, persia, and, became, affiliated, with, the, local, christian, community, there, this, community, adopted, an, increasingly, nestorian, theology, and, was, thereafter, often, known, as, the, nestorian, church, as, such, the, church, of, the, east, accepts, only, the, first, two, ecumenical, councils, of, the, undivided, church, the, first, council, of, nicaea, and, the, first, council, of, constantinople, as, defining, its, faith, tradition, and, rapidly, took, a, different, course, from, other, eastern, christians, the, church, of, the, east, spread, widely, through, persia, and, into, asia, being, introduced, to, india, by, the, 6th, century, and, to, the, mongols, and, china, in, the, 7th, century, it, experienced, periodic, expansion, until, the, 14th, century, when, the, church, was, nearly, destroyed, by, the, collapse, of, the, mongol, empire, and, the, conquests, of, timur, by, the, 16th, century, it, was, largely, confined, to, iraq, northeast, syria, southeast, turkey, northwest, iran, and, the, malabar, coast, of, india, kerala, the, split, of, the, 15th, century, which, saw, the, emergence, of, separate, assyrian, and, chaldean, churches, left, only, the, former, as, an, independent, sect, additional, splits, into, the, 20th, century, further, affected, the, history, of, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, saint, thomas, syrian, christians, are, an, ancient, body, of, syrian, christians, in, kerala, malabar, coast, of, india, who, trace, their, origins, to, the, evangelical, activity, of, thomas, the, apostle, in, the, 1st, century, many, assyrian, and, jewish, communities, like, the, knanaya, and, the, cochin, jews, assimilated, into, the, saint, thomas, syrian, christian, community, by, the, 5th, century, the, saint, thomas, syrian, christians, were, part, of, the, church, of, the, east, nestorian, church, until, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, and, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, the, thomas, christians, were, all, one, in, faith, and, rite, thereafter, divisions, arose, among, them, and, consequently, they, are, today, of, several, different, rites, the, east, syriac, chaldean, rite, edessan, rite, churches, among, the, saint, thomas, syrian, christians, are, the, syro, malabar, church, and, the, chaldean, syrian, church, the, west, syriac, antiochian, rite, churches, among, the, saint, thomas, syrian, christians, are, the, malankara, jacobite, syrian, church, the, malankara, orthodox, syrian, church, the, mar, thoma, syrian, church, the, syro, malankara, church, and, the, thozhiyur, church, the, twenty, three, eastern, catholic, churches, are, in, communion, with, the, holy, see, at, the, vatican, whilst, being, rooted, in, the, theological, and, liturgical, traditions, of, eastern, christianity, most, of, these, churches, were, originally, part, of, the, orthodox, east, but, have, since, been, reconciled, to, the, latin, church, many, of, these, churches, were, originally, part, of, one, of, the, above, families, and, so, are, closely, related, to, them, by, way, of, ethos, and, liturgical, practice, as, in, the, other, eastern, churches, married, men, may, become, priests, and, parish, priests, administer, the, mystery, of, confirmation, to, newborn, infants, immediately, after, baptism, via, the, rite, of, chrismation, the, infants, are, then, administered, holy, communion, the, syro, malabar, church, which, is, part, of, the, saint, thomas, christian, community, in, india, follows, east, syriac, traditions, and, liturgy, other, saint, thomas, christians, of, india, who, were, originally, of, the, same, east, syriac, tradition, passed, instead, to, the, west, syriac, tradition, and, now, form, part, of, oriental, orthodoxy, some, from, the, oriental, orthodox, in, india, united, with, the, catholic, church, in, 1930, and, became, the, syro, malankara, catholic, church, the, maronite, church, claims, never, to, have, been, separated, from, rome, and, has, no, counterpart, orthodox, church, out, of, communion, with, the, pope, it, is, therefore, inaccurate, to, refer, to, it, as, a, uniate, church, the, italo, albanian, catholic, church, has, also, never, been, out, of, communion, with, rome, but, unlike, the, maronite, church, it, resembles, the, liturgical, rite, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, in, addition, to, these, four, mainstream, branches, there, are, a, number, of, much, smaller, groups, which, originated, from, disputes, with, the, dominant, tradition, of, their, original, areas, most, of, these, are, either, part, of, the, more, traditional, old, believer, movement, which, arose, from, a, schism, within, russian, orthodoxy, or, the, more, radical, spiritual, christianity, movement, the, latter, includes, a, number, of, diverse, low, church, groups, from, the, bible, centered, molokans, to, the, anarchic, doukhobors, to, the, self, mutilating, skoptsy, none, of, these, groups, are, in, communion, with, the, mainstream, churches, listed, above, there, are, also, national, dissidents, where, ethnic, groups, want, their, own, nation, church, such, as, the, macedonian, orthodox, church, and, the, montenegrin, orthodox, church, both, are, domiciles, of, the, serbian, orthodox, church, there, are, also, some, reformed, churches, which, share, characteristics, of, eastern, christianity, to, varying, extents, starting, in, the, 1920s, parallel, hierarchies, formed, in, opposition, to, local, orthodox, churches, over, ecumenism, and, other, matters, these, jurisdictions, sometimes, refer, to, themselves, as, being, true, orthodox, in, russia, underground, churches, formed, and, maintained, solidarity, with, the, russian, orthodox, church, outside, russia, until, the, late, 1970s, there, are, now, traditionalist, orthodox, in, every, area, though, in, asia, and, egypt, their, presence, is, negligible, eastern, protestant, christianity, comprises, a, collection, of, heterogeneous, protestant, denominations, which, are, mostly, the, result, of, protestant, churches, adopting, reformation, variants, of, orthodox, christian, liturgy, and, worship, some, others, are, the, result, of, reformations, of, orthodox, christian, beliefs, and, practices, inspired, by, the, teachings, of, western, protestant, missionaries, denominations, of, this, category, include, the, malankara, mar, thoma, syrian, church, ukrainian, lutheran, church, st, thomas, evangelical, church,

since, the, 1964, meeting, between, pope, paul, vi, and, orthodox, patriarch, athenagoras, i, has, awoken, the, nearly, 1, 000, year, hopes, for, christian, unity, since, the, lifting, of,

dialogue, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, church, declared, that, these, initiatives, that, led, to, the, union, of, certain, communities, with, the, see, of, rome, and, brought, with, them, as, a, consequence, the, breaking, of, communion, with, their, mother, churches, of, the, east, took, place, not, without, the, interference, of, extra, ecclesial, interests, and, that, what, has, been, called, uniatism, can, no, longer, be, accepted, either, as, a, method, to, be, followed, nor, as, a, model, of, the, unity, our, churches, are, seeking, section, 12, at, the, same,
