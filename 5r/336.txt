abraham, originally, abram, is, the, common, hebrew, patriarch, of, the, abrahamic, religions, including, judaism, christianity, and, islam, in, judaism, he, is, the, founding, father, of, the, special, relationship, between, the, jews, and, god, in, christianity, he, is, the, spiritual, progenitor, of, all, believers, whether, jewish, or, non, jewish, and, in, islam, he, is, a, link, in, the, chain, of, islamic, prophets, that, begins, with, adam, and, culminates, in, muhammad, as, the, namesake, of, the, abrahamic, religions, abraham, is, also, revered, in, other, abrahamic, religions, such, as, druze, faith, and, bah, faith, the, story, of, the, life, of, abraham, as, told, in, the, narrative, of, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, hebrew, bible, revolves, around, the, themes, of, posterity, and, land, he, is, said, to, have, been, called, by, god, to, leave, the, house, of, his, father, terah, and, settle, in, the, land, of, canaan, which, god, now, promises, to, abraham, and, his, progeny, this, promise, is, subsequently, inherited, by, isaac, abraham, s, son, by, his, wife, sarah, while, isaac, s, half, brother, ishmael, is, also, promised, that, he, will, be, the, founder, of, a, great, nation, abraham, purchases, a, tomb, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, at, hebron, to, be, sarah, s, grave, thus, establishing, his, right, to, the, land, and, in, the, second, generation, his, heir, isaac, is, married, to, a, woman, from, his, own, kin, to, earn, his, parents, approval, abraham, later, marries, keturah, and, has, six, more, sons, but, on, his, death, when, he, is, buried, beside, sarah, it, is, isaac, who, receives, all, abraham, s, goods, while, the, other, sons, receive, only, gifts, most, scholars, view, the, patriarchal, age, along, with, the, exodus, and, the, period, of, the, biblical, judges, as, a, late, literary, construct, that, does, not, relate, to, any, particular, historical, era, and, after, a, century, of, exhaustive, archaeological, investigation, no, evidence, has, been, found, for, a, historical, abraham, it, is, largely, concluded, that, the, torah, the, series, of, books, that, includes, genesis, was, composed, during, the, early, persian, period, c, 500, bc, as, a, result, of, tensions, between, jewish, landowners, who, had, stayed, in, judah, during, the, babylonian, captivity, and, traced, their, right, to, the, land, through, their, father, abraham, and, the, returning, exiles, who, based, their, counterclaim, on, moses, and, the, exodus, tradition, of, the, israelites, the, abraham, cycle, is, not, structured, by, a, unified, plot, centered, on, a, conflict, and, its, resolution, or, a, problem, and, its, solution, the, episodes, are, often, only, loosely, linked, and, the, sequence, is, not, always, logical, but, it, is, unified, by, the, presence, of, abraham, himself, as, either, actor, or, witness, and, by, the, themes, of, posterity, and, land, these, themes, form, narrative, programs, set, out, in, genesis, 11, 27, 31, concerning, the, sterility, of, sarah, and, 12, 1, 3, in, which, abraham, is, ordered, to, leave, the, land, of, his, birth, for, the, land, yhwh, will, show, him, terah, the, ninth, in, descent, from, noah, was, the, father, of, abram, nahor, haran, hebrew, h, r, n, and, sarah, haran, was, the, father, of, lot, who, was, abram, s, nephew, the, family, lived, in, ur, of, the, chaldees, haran, died, there, abram, married, sarah, sarai, terah, abram, sarai, and, lot, departed, for, canaan, but, settled, in, a, place, named, haran, hebrew, r, n, where, terah, died, at, the, age, of, 205, according, to, some, exegetes, like, nahmanides, abram, was, actually, born, in, haran, and, he, later, relocated, to, ur, while, some, of, his, family, remained, in, haran, god, had, told, abram, to, leave, his, country, and, kindred, and, go, to, a, land, that, he, would, show, him, and, promised, to, make, of, him, a, great, nation, bless, him, make, his, name, great, bless, them, that, bless, him, and, curse, them, who, may, curse, him, abram, was, 75, years, old, when, he, left, haran, with, his, wife, sarai, his, nephew, lot, and, the, substance, and, souls, that, they, had, acquired, and, traveled, to, shechem, in, canaan, then, he, pitched, his, tent, in, the, east, of, bethel, and, built, an, altar, which, was, between, bethel, and, ai, there, was, a, severe, famine, in, the, land, of, canaan, so, that, abram, lot, and, their, households, traveled, to, egypt, on, the, way, abram, told, sarai, to, say, that, she, was, his, sister, so, that, the, egyptians, would, not, kill, him, when, they, entered, egypt, the, pharaoh, s, officials, praised, sarai, s, beauty, to, pharaoh, and, they, took, her, into, the, palace, and, gave, abram, goods, in, exchange, god, afflicted, pharaoh, and, his, household, with, plagues, which, led, pharaoh, to, try, to, find, out, what, was, wrong, upon, discovering, that, sarai, was, a, married, woman, pharaoh, demanded, that, abram, and, sarai, leave, when, they, lived, for, a, while, in, the, negev, after, being, banished, from, egypt, and, came, back, to, the, bethel, and, ai, area, abram, s, and, lot, s, sizable, herds, occupied, the, same, pastures, this, became, a, problem, for, the, herdsmen, who, were, assigned, to, each, family, s, cattle, the, conflicts, between, herdsmen, had, become, so, troublesome, that, abram, suggested, that, lot, choose, a, separate, area, either, on, the, left, hand, or, on, the, right, hand, that, there, be, no, conflict, between, them, lot, decided, to, go, eastward, to, the, plain, of, jordan, where, the, land, was, well, watered, everywhere, as, far, as, zoara, and, he, dwelled, in, the, cities, of, the, plain, toward, sodom, abram, went, south, to, hebron, and, settled, in, the, plain, of, mamre, where, he, built, another, altar, to, worship, god, during, the, rebellion, of, the, jordan, river, cities, sodom, and, gomorrah, against, elam, abram, s, nephew, lot, was, taken, prisoner, along, with, his, entire, household, by, the, invading, elamite, forces, the, elamite, army, came, to, collect, the, spoils, of, war, after, having, just, defeated, the, king, of, sodom, s, armies, lot, and, his, family, at, the, time, were, settled, on, the, outskirts, of, the, kingdom, of, sodom, which, made, them, a, visible, target, one, person, who, escaped, capture, came, and, told, abram, what, happened, once, abram, received, this, news, he, immediately, assembled, 318, trained, servants, abram, s, force, headed, north, in, pursuit, of, the, elamite, army, who, were, already, worn, down, from, the, battle, of, siddim, when, they, caught, up, with, them, at, dan, abram, devised, a, battle, plan, by, splitting, his, group, into, more, than, one, unit, and, launched, a, night, raid, not, only, were, they, able, to, free, the, captives, abram, s, unit, chased, and, slaughtered, the, elamite, king, chedorlaomer, at, hobah, just, north, of, damascus, they, freed, lot, as, well, as, his, household, and, possessions, and, recovered, all, of, the, goods, from, sodom, that, had, been, taken, upon, abram, s, return, sodom, s, king, came, out, to, meet, with, him, in, the, valley, of, shaveh, the, king, s, dale, also, melchizedek, king, of, salem, jerusalem, a, priest, of, el, elyon, brought, out, bread, and, wine, and, blessed, abram, and, god, abram, then, gave, melchizedek, a, tenth, of, everything, the, king, of, sodom, then, offered, to, let, abram, keep, all, the, possessions, if, he, would, merely, return, his, people, abram, declined, to, accept, anything, other, than, the, share, to, which, his, allies, were, entitled, the, voice, of, the, lord, came, to, abram, in, a, vision, and, repeated, the, promise, of, the, land, and, descendants, as, numerous, as, the, stars, abram, and, god, made, a, covenant, ceremony, and, god, told, of, the, future, bondage, of, israel, in, egypt, god, described, to, abram, the, land, that, his, offspring, would, claim, the, land, of, the, kenites, kenizzites, kadmonites, hittites, perizzites, rephaims, amorites, canaanites, girgashites, and, jebusites, abram, and, sarai, tried, to, make, sense, of, how, he, would, become, a, progenitor, of, nations, because, after, 10, years, of, living, in, canaan, no, child, had, been, born, sarai, then, offered, her, egyptian, slave, hagar, to, abram, with, the, intention, that, she, would, bear, him, a, son, after, hagar, found, she, was, pregnant, she, began, to, despise, her, mistress, sarai, sarai, responded, by, mistreating, hagar, and, hagar, fled, into, the, wilderness, an, angel, spoke, with, hagar, at, the, fountain, on, the, way, to, shur, he, instructed, her, to, return, to, abram, s, camp, and, that, her, son, would, be, a, wild, ass, of, a, man, his, hand, shall, be, against, every, man, and, every, man, s, hand, against, him, and, he, shall, dwell, in, the, face, of, all, his, brethren, she, was, told, to, call, her, son, ishmael, hagar, then, called, god, who, spoke, to, her, el, roi, thou, god, seest, me, kjv, from, that, day, onward, the, well, was, called, beer, lahai, roi, the, well, of, him, that, liveth, and, seeth, me, kjv, margin, located, between, kadesh, and, bered, she, then, did, as, she, was, instructed, by, returning, to, her, mistress, in, order, to, have, her, child, abram, was, 86, years, of, age, when, ishmael, was, born, thirteen, years, later, when, abram, was, 99, years, of, age, god, declared, abram, s, new, name, abraham, a, father, of, many, nations, abraham, then, received, the, instructions, for, the, covenant, of, the, pieces, of, which, circumcision, was, to, be, the, sign, god, declared, sarai, s, new, name, sarah, blessed, her, and, told, abraham, i, will, give, thee, a, son, also, of, her, abraham, laughed, and, said, in, his, heart, shall, a, child, be, born, unto, him, that, is, a, hundred, years, old, and, shall, sarah, that, is, ninety, years, old, bear, immediately, after, abraham, s, encounter, with, god, he, had, his, entire, household, of, men, including, himself, age, 99, and, ishmael, age, 13, circumcised, not, long, afterward, during, the, heat, of, the, day, abraham, had, been, sitting, at, the, entrance, of, his, tent, by, the, terebinths, of, mamre, he, looked, up, and, saw, three, men, in, the, presence, of, god, then, he, ran, and, bowed, to, the, ground, to, welcome, them, abraham, then, offered, to, wash, their, feet, and, fetch, them, a, morsel, of, bread, to, which, they, assented, abraham, rushed, to, sarah, s, tent, to, order, ash, cakes, made, from, choice, flour, then, he, ordered, a, servant, boy, to, prepare, a, choice, calf, when, all, was, prepared, he, set, curds, milk, and, the, calf, before, them, waiting, on, them, under, a, tree, as, they, ate, one, of, the, visitors, told, abraham, that, upon, his, return, next, year, sarah, would, have, a, son, while, at, the, tent, entrance, sarah, overheard, what, was, said, and, she, laughed, to, herself, about, the, prospect, of, having, a, child, at, their, ages, the, visitor, inquired, of, abraham, why, sarah, laughed, at, bearing, a, child, at, her, age, as, nothing, is, too, hard, for, god, frightened, sarah, denied, laughing, after, eating, abraham, and, the, three, visitors, got, up, they, walked, over, to, the, peak, that, overlooked, the, cities, of, the, plain, to, discuss, the, fate, of, sodom, and, gomorrah, for, their, detestable, sins, that, were, so, great, it, moved, god, to, action, because, abraham, s, nephew, was, living, in, sodom, god, revealed, plans, to, confirm, and, judge, these, cities, at, this, point, the, two, other, visitors, left, for, sodom, then, abraham, turned, to, god, and, pleaded, decrementally, with, him, from, fifty, persons, to, less, that, if, there, were, at, least, ten, righteous, men, found, in, the, city, would, not, god, spare, the, city, for, the, sake, of, ten, righteous, people, god, declared, that, he, would, not, destroy, the, city, when, the, two, visitors, arrived, in, sodom, to, conduct, their, report, they, planned, on, staying, in, the, city, square, however, abraham, s, nephew, lot, met, with, them, and, strongly, insisted, that, these, two, men, stay, at, his, house, for, the, night, a, rally, of, men, stood, outside, of, lot, s, home, and, demanded, that, lot, bring, out, his, guests, so, that, they, may, know, v, 5, them, however, lot, objected, and, offered, his, virgin, daughters, who, had, not, known, v, 8, man, to, the, rally, of, men, instead, they, rejected, that, notion, and, sought, to, break, down, lot, s, door, to, get, to, his, male, guests, thus, confirming, the, wickedness, of, the, city, and, portending, their, imminent, destruction, early, the, next, morning, abraham, went, to, the, place, where, he, stood, before, god, he, looked, out, toward, sodom, and, gomorrah, and, saw, what, became, of, the, cities, of, the, plain, where, not, even, ten, righteous, v, 18, 32, had, been, found, as, the, smoke, of, the, land, went, up, as, the, smoke, of, a, furnace, abraham, settled, between, kadesh, and, shur, in, what, the, bible, anachronistically, calls, the, land, of, the, philistines, while, he, was, living, in, gerar, abraham, openly, claimed, that, sarah, was, his, sister, upon, discovering, this, news, king, abimelech, had, her, brought, to, him, god, then, came, to, abimelech, in, a, dream, and, declared, that, taking, her, would, result, in, death, because, she, was, a, man, s, wife, abimelech, had, not, laid, hands, on, her, so, he, inquired, if, he, would, also, slay, a, righteous, nation, especially, since, abraham, had, claimed, that, he, and, sarah, were, siblings, in, response, god, told, abimelech, that, he, did, indeed, have, a, blameless, heart, and, that, is, why, he, continued, to, exist, however, should, he, not, return, the, wife, of, abraham, back, to, him, god, would, surely, destroy, abimelech, and, his, entire, household, abimelech, was, informed, that, abraham, was, a, prophet, who, would, pray, for, him, early, next, morning, abimelech, informed, his, servants, of, his, dream, and, approached, abraham, inquiring, as, to, why, he, had, brought, such, great, guilt, upon, his, kingdom, abraham, stated, that, he, thought, there, was, no, fear, of, god, in, that, place, and, that, they, might, kill, him, for, his, wife, then, abraham, defended, what, he, had, said, as, not, being, a, lie, at, all, and, yet, indeed, she, is, my, sister, she, is, the, daughter, of, my, father, but, not, the, daughter, of, my, mother, and, she, became, my, wife, abimelech, returned, sarah, to, abraham, and, gave, him, gifts, of, sheep, oxen, and, servants, and, invited, him, to, settle, wherever, he, pleased, in, abimelech, s, lands, further, abimelech, gave, abraham, a, thousand, pieces, of, silver, to, serve, as, sarah, s, vindication, before, all, abraham, then, prayed, for, abimelech, and, his, household, since, god, had, stricken, the, women, with, infertility, because, of, the, taking, of, sarah, after, living, for, some, time, in, the, land, of, the, philistines, abimelech, and, phicol, the, chief, of, his, troops, approached, abraham, because, of, a, dispute, that, resulted, in, a, violent, confrontation, at, a, well, abraham, then, reproached, abimelech, due, to, his, philistine, servant, s, aggressive, attacks, and, the, seizing, of, abraham, s, well, abimelech, claimed, ignorance, of, the, incident, then, abraham, offered, a, pact, by, providing, sheep, and, oxen, to, abimelech, further, to, attest, that, abraham, was, the, one, who, dug, the, well, he, also, gave, abimelech, seven, ewes, for, proof, because, of, this, sworn, oath, they, called, the, place, of, this, well, beersheba, after, abimelech, and, phicol, headed, back, to, philistia, abraham, planted, a, tamarisk, grove, in, beersheba, and, called, upon, the, name, of, the, l, ord, the, everlasting, god, as, had, been, prophesied, in, mamre, the, previous, year, sarah, became, pregnant, and, bore, a, son, to, abraham, on, the, first, anniversary, of, the, covenant, of, circumcision, abraham, was, an, hundred, years, old, when, his, son, whom, he, named, isaac, was, born, and, he, circumcised, him, when, he, was, eight, days, old, for, sarah, the, thought, of, giving, birth, and, nursing, a, child, at, such, an, old, age, also, brought, her, much, laughter, as, she, declared, god, hath, made, me, to, laugh, so, that, all, who, hear, will, laugh, with, me, isaac, continued, to, grow, and, on, the, day, he, was, weaned, abraham, held, a, great, feast, to, honor, the, occasion, during, the, celebration, however, sarah, found, ishmael, mocking, an, observation, that, would, begin, to, clarify, the, birthright, of, isaac, ishmael, was, fourteen, years, old, when, abraham, s, son, isaac, was, born, to, sarah, when, she, found, ishmael, teasing, isaac, sarah, told, abraham, to, send, both, ishmael, and, hagar, away, she, declared, that, ishmael, would, not, share, in, isaac, s, inheritance, abraham, was, greatly, distressed, by, his, wife, s, words, and, sought, the, advice, of, his, god, god, told, abraham, not, to, be, distressed, but, to, do, as, his, wife, commanded, god, reassured, abraham, that, in, isaac, shall, seed, be, called, to, thee, he, also, said, ishmael, would, make, a, nation, because, he, is, thy, seed, early, the, next, morning, abraham, brought, hagar, and, ishmael, out, together, he, gave, her, bread, and, water, and, sent, them, away, the, two, wandered, in, the, wilderness, of, beersheba, until, her, bottle, of, water, was, completely, consumed, in, a, moment, of, despair, she, burst, into, tears, after, god, heard, the, boy, s, voice, an, angel, of, the, lord, confirmed, to, hagar, that, he, would, become, a, great, nation, and, will, be, living, on, his, sword, a, well, of, water, then, appeared, so, that, it, saved, their, lives, as, the, boy, grew, he, became, a, skilled, archer, living, in, the, wilderness, of, paran, eventually, his, mother, found, a, wife, for, ishmael, from, her, home, country, the, land, of, egypt, at, some, point, in, isaac, s, youth, abraham, was, commanded, by, god, to, offer, his, son, up, as, a, sacrifice, in, the, land, of, moriah, the, patriarch, traveled, three, days, until, he, came, to, the, mount, that, god, told, him, of, he, then, commanded, the, servants, to, remain, while, he, and, isaac, proceeded, alone, into, the, mount, isaac, carried, the, wood, upon, which, he, would, be, sacrificed, along, the, way, isaac, asked, his, father, where, the, animal, for, the, burnt, offering, was, to, which, abraham, replied, god, will, provide, himself, a, lamb, for, a, burnt, offering, just, as, abraham, was, about, to, sacrifice, his, son, he, was, interrupted, by, the, angel, of, the, lord, and, he, saw, behind, him, a, ram, caught, in, a, thicket, by, his, horns, which, he, sacrificed, instead, of, his, son, the, place, was, later, named, as, jehovah, jireh, for, his, obedience, he, received, another, promise, of, numerous, descendants, and, abundant, prosperity, after, this, event, abraham, went, to, beersheba, sarah, died, and, abraham, buried, her, in, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, the, cave, of, machpelah, near, hebron, which, he, had, purchased, along, with, the, adjoining, field, from, ephron, the, hittite, after, the, death, of, sarah, abraham, took, another, wife, a, concubine, named, keturah, by, whom, he, had, six, sons, zimran, jokshan, medan, midian, ishbak, and, shuah, according, to, the, bible, reflecting, the, change, of, his, name, to, abraham, meaning, a, father, of, many, nations, abraham, is, considered, to, be, the, progenitor, of, many, nations, mentioned, in, the, bible, among, others, the, israelites, ishmaelites, edomites, amalekites, kenizzites, midianites, and, assyrians, and, through, his, nephew, lot, he, was, also, related, to, the, moabites, and, ammonites, abraham, lived, to, see, isaac, marry, rebekah, and, to, see, the, birth, of, his, twin, grandsons, jacob, and, esau, he, died, at, age, 175, and, was, buried, in, the, cave, of, machpelah, by, his, sons, isaac, and, ishmael, in, the, early, and, middle, 20th, century, leading, archaeologists, such, as, william, f, albright, and, g, ernest, wright, and, biblical, scholars, such, as, albrecht, alt, and, john, bright, believed, that, the, patriarchs, and, matriarchs, were, either, real, individuals, or, believable, composites, of, people, who, lived, in, the, patriarchal, age, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, but, in, the, 1970s, new, arguments, concerning, israel, s, past, and, the, biblical, texts, challenged, these, views, these, arguments, can, be, found, in, thomas, l, thompson, s, the, historicity, of, the, patriarchal, narratives, 1974, and, john, van, seters, abraham, in, history, and, tradition, 1975, thompson, a, literary, scholar, based, his, argument, on, archaeology, and, ancient, texts, his, thesis, centered, on, the, lack, of, compelling, evidence, that, the, patriarchs, lived, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, and, noted, how, certain, biblical, texts, reflected, first, millennium, conditions, and, concerns, van, seters, examined, the, patriarchal, stories, and, argued, that, their, names, social, milieu, and, messages, strongly, suggested, that, they, were, iron, age, creations, van, seters, and, thompson, s, works, were, a, paradigm, shift, in, biblical, scholarship, and, archaeology, which, gradually, led, scholars, to, no, longer, consider, the, patriarchal, narratives, as, historical, some, conservative, scholars, attempted, to, defend, the, patriarchal, narratives, in, the, following, years, but, this, has, not, found, acceptance, among, scholars, by, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, archaeologists, had, stopped, trying, to, recover, any, context, that, would, make, abraham, isaac, or, jacob, credible, historical, figures, abraham, s, story, like, those, of, the, other, patriarchs, most, likely, had, a, substantial, oral, prehistory, he, is, mentioned, in, the, book, of, ezekiel, and, the, book, of, isaiah, as, with, moses, abraham, s, name, is, apparently, very, ancient, as, the, tradition, found, in, the, book, of, genesis, no, longer, understands, its, original, meaning, probably, father, is, exalted, the, meaning, offered, in, genesis, 17, 5, father, of, a, multitude, is, a, folk, etymology, at, some, stage, the, oral, traditions, became, part, of, the, written, tradition, of, the, pentateuch, a, majority, of, scholars, believe, this, stage, belongs, to, the, persian, period, roughly, 520, 320, bce, the, mechanisms, by, which, this, came, about, remain, unknown, but, there, are, currently, at, least, two, hypotheses, the, first, called, persian, imperial, authorisation, is, that, the, post, exilic, community, devised, the, torah, as, a, legal, basis, on, which, to, function, within, the, persian, imperial, system, the, second, is, that, the, pentateuch, was, written, to, provide, the, criteria, for, determining, who, would, belong, to, the, post, exilic, jewish, community, and, to, establish, the, power, structures, and, relative, positions, of, its, various, groups, notably, the, priesthood, and, the, lay, elders, the, completion, of, the, torah, and, its, elevation, to, the, centre, of, post, exilic, judaism, was, as, much, or, more, about, combining, older, texts, as, writing, new, ones, the, final, pentateuch, was, based, on, existing, traditions, in, the, book, of, ezekiel, written, during, the, exile, i, e, in, the, first, half, of, the, 6th, century, bce, ezekiel, an, exile, in, babylon, tells, how, those, who, remained, in, judah, are, claiming, ownership, of, the, land, based, on, inheritance, from, abraham, but, the, prophet, tells, them, they, have, no, claim, because, they, do, not, observe, torah, the, book, of, isaiah, similarly, testifies, of, tension, between, the, people, of, judah, and, the, returning, post, exilic, jews, the, g, l, stating, that, god, is, the, father, of, israel, and, that, israel, s, history, begins, with, the, exodus, and, not, with, abraham, the, conclusion, to, be, inferred, from, this, and, similar, evidence, e, g, ezra, nehemiah, is, that, the, figure, of, abraham, must, have, been, preeminent, among, the, great, landowners, of, judah, at, the, time, of, the, exile, and, after, serving, to, support, their, claims, to, the, land, in, opposition, to, those, of, the, returning, exiles, in, 1915, lewis, bayles, paton, suggested, that, abraham, was, an, amorite, based, on, his, early, name, which, was, identical, with, the, amorite, name, abi, ramu, that, name, was, found, in, a, tablet, of, apil, sin, the, fourth, king, of, the, first, dynasty, of, babylon, which, was, amorite, dominated, but, ultimately, he, concluded, that, abraham, was, an, amorite, aramean, to, explain, away, discrepancies, within, the, biblical, text, more, recently, scholars, like, daniel, e, fleming, and, alice, mandell, have, argued, that, the, biblical, portrayal, of, the, patriarchs, lifestyle, appears, to, reflect, the, amorite, culture, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, as, attested, in, texts, from, the, ancient, city, state, of, mari, suggesting, that, the, genesis, stories, retain, historical, memories, of, the, ancestral, origins, of, some, of, the, israelites, the, earliest, possible, reference, to, abraham, may, be, the, name, of, a, town, in, the, negev, listed, in, a, victory, inscription, of, pharaoh, sheshonq, i, biblical, shishak, which, is, referred, as, the, fortress, of, abraham, suggesting, the, possible, existence, of, an, abraham, tradition, in, the, 10th, century, bce, the, orientalist, mario, liverani, proposed, to, see, in, the, name, abraham, the, mythical, eponym, of, a, palestinian, tribe, from, the, 13th, century, bce, that, of, the, raham, of, which, mention, was, found, in, the, stele, of, seti, i, found, in, beth, she, an, and, dating, back, to, around, 1289, bce, the, tribe, probably, lived, in, the, area, surrounding, or, close, to, beth, she, an, in, galilee, the, stele, in, fact, refers, to, fights, that, took, place, in, the, area, the, semi, nomadic, and, pastoral, semitic, tribes, of, the, time, used, to, prefix, their, names, with, the, term, ban, sons, of, so, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, raham, called, themselves, banu, raham, furthermore, many, interpreted, blood, ties, between, tribe, members, as, common, descent, from, an, eponymous, ancestor, i, e, one, who, gave, the, tribe, its, name, rather, than, as, the, result, of, intra, tribal, ties, the, name, of, this, eponymous, mythical, ancestor, was, constructed, with, the, patronymic, prefix, ab, father, followed, by, the, name, of, the, tribe, in, the, case, of, the, raham, it, would, have, been, abu, raham, later, to, become, ab, raham, abraham, abraham, s, journey, from, ur, to, harran, could, be, explained, as, a, retrospective, reflection, of, the, story, of, the, return, of, the, jews, from, the, babylonian, exile, indeed, israel, finkelstein, suggested, that, the, oldest, abraham, traditions, originated, in, the, iron, age, monarchic, period, and, that, they, contained, an, autochthonous, hero, story, as, the, oldest, mentions, of, abraham, outside, the, book, of, genesis, ezekiel, 33, and, isaiah, 51, do, not, depend, on, genesis, 12, 26, do, not, have, an, indication, of, a, mesopotamian, origin, of, abraham, and, present, only, two, main, themes, of, the, abraham, narrative, in, genesis, land, and, offspring, yet, unlike, liverani, finkelstein, considered, abraham, as, ancestor, who, was, worshiped, in, hebron, which, is, too, far, from, beit, she, an, and, the, oldest, tradition, of, him, might, be, about, the, altar, he, built, in, hebron, abraham, is, given, a, high, position, of, respect, in,

leading, to, the, belief, that, the, jews, are, the, chosen, people, of, god, in, christianity, paul, the, apostle, taught, that, abraham, s, faith, in, god, preceding, the, mosaic, law, made, him, the, prototype, of, all, believers, jewish, or, gentile, and, in, islam, he, is, seen, as, a, link, in, the, chain, of, prophets, that, begins, with, adam, and, culminates, in, muhammad, in, jewish,

heaven, and, earth, for, the, sake, of, the, merits, of, abraham, after, the, biblical, flood, abraham, was, the, only, one, among, the, pious, who, solemnly, swore, never, to, forsake, god, studied, in, the, house, of, noah, and, shem, to, learn, about, the, ways, of, god, continued, the, line, of, high, priest, from, noah, and, shem, and, assigning, the, office, to, levi, and, his, seed,

of, abraham, as, described, in, the, gospel, of, luke, became, an, iconic, image, in, christian, works, according, to, o, kane, artists, often, chose, to, divert, from, the, common, literary, portrayal, of, lazarus, sitting, next, to, abraham, at, a, banquet, in, heaven, and, instead, focus, on, the, somewhat, incongruous, notion, of, abraham, the, most, venerated, of, patriarchs, holding,
