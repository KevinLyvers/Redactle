ancient, greek, philosophy, arose, in, the, 6th, century, bc, philosophy, was, used, to, make, sense, of, the, world, using, reason, it, dealt, with, a, wide, variety, of, subjects, including, astronomy, epistemology, mathematics, political, philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric, and, aesthetics, greek, philosophy, continued, throughout, the, hellenistic, period, and, later, evolved, into, roman, philosophy, greek, philosophy, has, influenced, much, of, western, culture, since, its, inception, and, can, be, found, in, many, aspects, of, public, education, alfred, north, whitehead, once, claimed, the, safest, general, characterization, of, the, european, philosophical, tradition, is, that, it, consists, of, a, series, of, footnotes, to, plato, clear, unbroken, lines, of, influence, lead, from, ancient, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophers, to, roman, philosophy, early, islamic, philosophy, medieval, scholasticism, the, european, renaissance, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, greek, philosophy, was, influenced, to, some, extent, by, the, older, wisdom, literature, and, mythological, cosmogonies, of, the, ancient, near, east, though, the, extent, of, this, influence, is, widely, debated, the, classicist, martin, litchfield, west, states, contact, with, oriental, cosmology, and, theology, helped, to, liberate, the, early, greek, philosophers, imagination, it, certainly, gave, them, many, suggestive, ideas, but, they, taught, themselves, to, reason, philosophy, as, we, understand, it, is, a, greek, creation, subsequent, philosophic, tradition, was, so, influenced, by, socrates, as, presented, by, plato, that, it, is, conventional, to, refer, to, philosophy, developed, prior, to, socrates, as, pre, socratic, philosophy, the, periods, following, this, up, to, and, after, the, wars, of, alexander, the, great, are, those, of, classical, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophy, respectively, the, convention, of, terming, those, philosophers, who, were, active, prior, to, the, death, of, socrates, as, the, pre, socratics, gained, currency, with, the, 1903, publication, of, hermann, diels, fragmente, der, vorsokratiker, although, the, term, did, not, originate, with, him, the, term, is, considered, useful, because, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, athenian, school, composed, of, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, signaled, the, rise, of, a, new, approach, to, philosophy, friedrich, nietzsche, s, thesis, that, this, shift, began, with, plato, rather, than, with, socrates, hence, his, nomenclature, of, pre, platonic, philosophy, has, not, prevented, the, predominance, of, the, pre, socratic, distinction, since, 2016, however, current, scholarship, has, transitioned, from, calling, philosophy, before, the, athenian, school, pre, socratic, to, simply, early, greek, philosophy, andr, laks, and, glenn, w, most, have, been, partly, responsible, for, popularizing, this, shift, in, describing, the, era, preceding, the, athenian, school, through, their, comprehensive, nine, volume, loeb, editions, of, early, greek, philosophy, in, their, first, volume, they, distinguish, their, systematic, approach, from, that, of, hermann, diels, beginning, with, the, choice, of, early, greek, philosophy, over, pre, socratic, philosophy, most, notably, because, socrates, is, contemporary, and, sometimes, even, prior, to, philosophers, traditionally, considered, pre, socratic, e, g, the, atomists, the, early, greek, philosophers, or, pre, socratics, were, primarily, concerned, with, cosmology, ontology, and, mathematics, they, were, distinguished, from, non, philosophers, insofar, as, they, rejected, mythological, explanations, in, favor, of, reasoned, discourse, thales, of, miletus, regarded, by, aristotle, as, the, first, philosopher, held, that, all, things, arise, from, a, single, material, substance, water, it, is, not, because, he, gave, a, cosmogony, that, john, burnet, calls, him, the, first, man, of, science, but, because, he, gave, a, naturalistic, explanation, of, the, cosmos, and, supported, it, with, reasons, according, to, tradition, thales, was, able, to, predict, an, eclipse, and, taught, the, egyptians, how, to, measure, the, height, of, the, pyramids, thales, inspired, the, milesian, school, of, philosophy, and, was, followed, by, anaximander, who, argued, that, the, substratum, or, arche, could, not, be, water, or, any, of, the, classical, elements, but, was, instead, something, unlimited, or, indefinite, in, greek, the, apeiron, he, began, from, the, observation, that, the, world, seems, to, consist, of, opposites, e, g, hot, and, cold, yet, a, thing, can, become, its, opposite, e, g, a, hot, thing, cold, therefore, they, cannot, truly, be, opposites, but, rather, must, both, be, manifestations, of, some, underlying, unity, that, is, neither, this, underlying, unity, substratum, arche, could, not, be, any, of, the, classical, elements, since, they, were, one, extreme, or, another, for, example, water, is, wet, the, opposite, of, dry, while, fire, is, dry, the, opposite, of, wet, this, initial, state, is, ageless, and, imperishable, and, everything, returns, to, it, according, to, necessity, anaximenes, in, turn, held, that, the, arche, was, air, although, john, burnet, argues, that, by, this, he, meant, that, it, was, a, transparent, mist, the, aether, despite, their, varied, answers, the, milesian, school, was, searching, for, a, natural, substance, that, would, remain, unchanged, despite, appearing, in, different, forms, and, thus, represents, one, of, the, first, scientific, attempts, to, answer, the, question, that, would, lead, to, the, development, of, modern, atomic, theory, the, milesians, says, burnet, asked, for, the, of, all, things, xenophanes, was, born, in, ionia, where, the, milesian, school, was, at, its, most, powerful, and, may, have, picked, up, some, of, the, milesians, cosmological, theories, as, a, result, what, is, known, is, that, he, argued, that, each, of, the, phenomena, had, a, natural, rather, than, divine, explanation, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, anaximander, s, theories, and, that, there, was, only, one, god, the, world, as, a, whole, and, that, he, ridiculed, the, anthropomorphism, of, the, greek, religion, by, claiming, that, cattle, would, claim, that, the, gods, looked, like, cattle, horses, like, horses, and, lions, like, lions, just, as, the, ethiopians, claimed, that, the, gods, were, snub, nosed, and, black, and, the, thracians, claimed, they, were, pale, and, red, haired, xenophanes, was, highly, influential, to, subsequent, schools, of, philosophy, he, was, seen, as, the, founder, of, a, line, of, philosophy, that, culminated, in, pyrrhonism, possibly, an, influence, on, eleatic, philosophy, and, a, precursor, to, epicurus, total, break, between, science, and, religion, pythagoras, lived, at, approximately, the, same, time, that, xenophanes, did, and, in, contrast, to, the, latter, the, school, that, he, founded, sought, to, reconcile, religious, belief, and, reason, little, is, known, about, his, life, with, any, reliability, however, and, no, writings, of, his, survive, so, it, is, possible, that, he, was, simply, a, mystic, whose, successors, introduced, rationalism, into, pythagoreanism, that, he, was, simply, a, rationalist, whose, successors, are, responsible, for, the, mysticism, in, pythagoreanism, or, that, he, was, actually, the, author, of, the, doctrine, there, is, no, way, to, know, for, certain, pythagoras, is, said, to, have, been, a, disciple, of, anaximander, and, to, have, imbibed, the, cosmological, concerns, of, the, ionians, including, the, idea, that, the, cosmos, is, constructed, of, spheres, the, importance, of, the, infinite, and, that, air, or, aether, is, the, arche, of, everything, pythagoreanism, also, incorporated, ascetic, ideals, emphasizing, purgation, metempsychosis, and, consequently, a, respect, for, all, animal, life, much, was, made, of, the, correspondence, between, mathematics, and, the, cosmos, in, a, musical, harmony, pythagoras, believed, that, behind, the, appearance, of, things, there, was, the, permanent, principle, of, mathematics, and, that, the, forms, were, based, on, a, transcendental, mathematical, relation, heraclitus, must, have, lived, after, xenophanes, and, pythagoras, as, he, condemns, them, along, with, homer, as, proving, that, much, learning, cannot, teach, a, man, to, think, since, parmenides, refers, to, him, in, the, past, tense, this, would, place, him, in, the, 5th, century, bc, contrary, to, the, milesian, school, which, posits, one, stable, element, as, the, arche, heraclitus, taught, that, panta, rhei, everything, flows, the, closest, element, to, this, eternal, flux, being, fire, all, things, come, to, pass, in, accordance, with, logos, which, must, be, considered, as, plan, or, formula, and, the, logos, is, common, he, also, posited, a, unity, of, opposites, expressed, through, dialectic, which, structured, this, flux, such, as, that, seeming, opposites, in, fact, are, manifestations, of, a, common, substrate, to, good, and, evil, itself, heraclitus, called, the, oppositional, processes, eris, strife, and, hypothesized, that, the, apparently, stable, state, of, dik, or, justice, is, the, harmonic, unity, of, these, opposites, parmenides, of, elea, cast, his, philosophy, against, those, who, held, it, is, and, is, not, the, same, and, all, things, travel, in, opposite, directions, presumably, referring, to, heraclitus, and, those, who, followed, him, whereas, the, doctrines, of, the, milesian, school, in, suggesting, that, the, substratum, could, appear, in, a, variety, of, different, guises, implied, that, everything, that, exists, is, corpuscular, parmenides, argued, that, the, first, principle, of, being, was, one, indivisible, and, unchanging, being, he, argued, by, definition, implies, eternality, while, only, that, which, is, can, be, thought, a, thing, which, is, moreover, cannot, be, more, or, less, and, so, the, rarefaction, and, condensation, of, the, milesians, is, impossible, regarding, being, lastly, as, movement, requires, that, something, exist, apart, from, the, thing, moving, viz, the, space, into, which, it, moves, the, one, or, being, cannot, move, since, this, would, require, that, space, both, exist, and, not, exist, while, this, doctrine, is, at, odds, with, ordinary, sensory, experience, where, things, do, indeed, change, and, move, the, eleatic, school, followed, parmenides, in, denying, that, sense, phenomena, revealed, the, world, as, it, actually, was, instead, the, only, thing, with, being, was, thought, or, the, question, of, whether, something, exists, or, not, is, one, of, whether, it, can, be, thought, in, support, of, this, parmenides, pupil, zeno, of, elea, attempted, to, prove, that, the, concept, of, motion, was, absurd, and, as, such, motion, did, not, exist, he, also, attacked, the, subsequent, development, of, pluralism, arguing, that, it, was, incompatible, with, being, his, arguments, are, known, as, zeno, s, paradoxes, the, power, of, parmenides, logic, was, such, that, some, subsequent, philosophers, abandoned, the, monism, of, the, milesians, xenophanes, heraclitus, and, parmenides, where, one, thing, was, the, arche, in, place, of, this, they, adopted, pluralism, such, as, empedocles, and, anaxagoras, there, were, they, said, multiple, elements, which, were, not, reducible, to, one, another, and, these, were, set, in, motion, by, love, and, strife, as, in, empedocles, or, by, mind, as, in, anaxagoras, agreeing, with, parmenides, that, there, is, no, coming, into, being, or, passing, away, genesis, or, decay, they, said, that, things, appear, to, come, into, being, and, pass, away, because, the, elements, out, of, which, they, are, composed, assemble, or, disassemble, while, themselves, being, unchanging, leucippus, also, proposed, an, ontological, pluralism, with, a, cosmogony, based, on, two, main, elements, the, vacuum, and, atoms, these, by, means, of, their, inherent, movement, are, crossing, the, void, and, creating, the, real, material, bodies, his, theories, were, not, well, known, by, the, time, of, plato, however, and, they, were, ultimately, incorporated, into, the, work, of, his, student, democritus, sophism, arose, from, the, juxtaposition, of, physis, nature, and, nomos, law, john, burnet, posits, its, origin, in, the, scientific, progress, of, the, previous, centuries, which, suggested, that, being, was, radically, different, from, what, was, experienced, by, the, senses, and, if, comprehensible, at, all, was, not, comprehensible, in, terms, of, order, the, world, in, which, people, lived, on, the, other, hand, was, one, of, law, and, order, albeit, of, humankind, s, own, making, at, the, same, time, nature, was, constant, while, what, was, by, law, differed, from, one, place, to, another, and, could, be, changed, the, first, person, to, call, themselves, a, sophist, according, to, plato, was, protagoras, whom, he, presents, as, teaching, that, all, virtue, is, conventional, it, was, protagoras, who, claimed, that, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, of, the, things, that, are, that, they, are, and, of, the, things, that, are, not, that, they, are, not, which, plato, interprets, as, a, radical, perspectivism, where, some, things, seem, to, be, one, way, for, one, person, and, so, actually, are, that, way, and, another, way, for, another, person, and, so, actually, are, that, way, as, well, the, conclusion, being, that, one, cannot, look, to, nature, for, guidance, regarding, how, to, live, one, s, life, protagoras, and, subsequent, sophists, tended, to, teach, rhetoric, as, their, primary, vocation, prodicus, gorgias, hippias, and, thrasymachus, appear, in, various, dialogues, sometimes, explicitly, teaching, that, while, nature, provides, no, ethical, guidance, the, guidance, that, the, laws, provide, is, worthless, or, that, nature, favors, those, who, act, against, the, laws, socrates, believed, to, have, been, born, in, athens, in, the, 5th, century, bc, marks, a, watershed, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, athens, was, a, center, of, learning, with, sophists, and, philosophers, traveling, from, across, greece, to, teach, rhetoric, astronomy, cosmology, and, geometry, while, philosophy, was, an, established, pursuit, prior, to, socrates, cicero, credits, him, as, the, first, who, brought, philosophy, down, from, the, heavens, placed, it, in, cities, introduced, it, into, families, and, obliged, it, to, examine, into, life, and, morals, and, good, and, evil, by, this, account, he, would, be, considered, the, founder, of, political, philosophy, the, reasons, for, this, turn, toward, political, and, ethical, subjects, remain, the, object, of, much, study, the, fact, that, many, conversations, involving, socrates, as, recounted, by, plato, and, xenophon, end, without, having, reached, a, firm, conclusion, or, aporetically, has, stimulated, debate, over, the, meaning, of, the, socratic, method, socrates, is, said, to, have, pursued, this, probing, question, and, answer, style, of, examination, on, a, number, of, topics, usually, attempting, to, arrive, at, a, defensible, and, attractive, definition, of, a, virtue, while, socrates, recorded, conversations, rarely, provide, a, definite, answer, to, the, question, under, examination, several, maxims, or, paradoxes, for, which, he, has, become, known, recur, socrates, taught, that, no, one, desires, what, is, bad, and, so, if, anyone, does, something, that, truly, is, bad, it, must, be, unwillingly, or, out, of, ignorance, consequently, all, virtue, is, knowledge, he, frequently, remarks, on, his, own, ignorance, claiming, that, he, does, not, know, what, courage, is, for, example, plato, presents, him, as, distinguishing, himself, from, the, common, run, of, mankind, by, the, fact, that, while, they, know, nothing, noble, and, good, they, do, not, know, that, they, do, not, know, whereas, socrates, knows, and, acknowledges, that, he, knows, nothing, noble, and, good, the, great, statesman, pericles, was, closely, associated, with, this, new, learning, and, a, friend, of, anaxagoras, however, and, his, political, opponents, struck, at, him, by, taking, advantage, of, a, conservative, reaction, against, the, philosophers, it, became, a, crime, to, investigate, the, things, above, the, heavens, or, below, the, earth, subjects, considered, impious, anaxagoras, is, said, to, have, been, charged, and, to, have, fled, into, exile, when, socrates, was, about, twenty, years, of, age, there, is, a, story, that, protagoras, too, was, forced, to, flee, and, that, the, athenians, burned, his, books, socrates, however, is, the, only, subject, recorded, as, charged, under, this, law, convicted, and, sentenced, to, death, in, 399, bc, see, trial, of, socrates, in, the, version, of, his, defense, speech, presented, by, plato, he, claims, that, it, is, the, envy, he, arouses, on, account, of, his, being, a, philosopher, that, will, convict, him, numerous, subsequent, philosophical, movements, were, inspired, by, socrates, or, his, younger, associates, plato, casts, socrates, as, the, main, interlocutor, in, his, dialogues, deriving, from, them, the, basis, of, platonism, and, by, extension, neoplatonism, plato, s, student, aristotle, in, turn, criticized, and, built, upon, the, doctrines, he, ascribed, to, socrates, and, plato, forming, the, foundation, of, aristotelianism, antisthenes, founded, the, school, that, would, come, to, be, known, as, cynicism, and, accused, plato, of, distorting, socrates, teachings, zeno, of, citium, in, turn, adapted, the, ethics, of, cynicism, to, articulate, stoicism, epicurus, studied, with, platonic, and, pyrrhonist, teachers, before, renouncing, all, previous, philosophers, including, democritus, on, whose, atomism, the, epicurean, philosophy, relies, the, philosophic, movements, that, were, to, dominate, the, intellectual, life, of, the, roman, empire, were, thus, born, in, this, febrile, period, following, socrates, activity, and, either, directly, or, indirectly, influenced, by, him, they, were, also, absorbed, by, the, expanding, muslim, world, in, the, 7th, through, 10th, centuries, ad, from, which, they, returned, to, the, west, as, foundations, of, medieval, philosophy, and, the, renaissance, as, discussed, below, plato, was, an, athenian, of, the, generation, after, socrates, ancient, tradition, ascribes, thirty, six, dialogues, and, thirteen, letters, to, him, although, of, these, only, twenty, four, of, the, dialogues, are, now, universally, recognized, as, authentic, most, modern, scholars, believe, that, at, least, twenty, eight, dialogues, and, two, of, the, letters, were, in, fact, written, by, plato, although, all, of, the, thirty, six, dialogues, have, some, defenders, a, further, nine, dialogues, are, ascribed, to, plato, but, were, considered, spurious, even, in, antiquity, plato, s, dialogues, feature, socrates, although, not, always, as, the, leader, of, the, conversation, one, dialogue, the, laws, instead, contains, an, athenian, stranger, along, with, xenophon, plato, is, the, primary, source, of, information, about, socrates, life, and, beliefs, and, it, is, not, always, easy, to, distinguish, between, the, two, while, the, socrates, presented, in, the, dialogues, is, often, taken, to, be, plato, s, mouthpiece, socrates, reputation, for, irony, his, caginess, regarding, his, own, opinions, in, the, dialogues, and, his, occasional, absence, from, or, minor, role, in, the, conversation, serve, to, conceal, plato, s, doctrines, much, of, what, is, said, about, his, doctrines, is, derived, from, what, aristotle, reports, about, them, the, political, doctrine, ascribed, to, plato, is, derived, from, the, republic, the, laws, and, the, statesman, the, first, of, these, contains, the, suggestion, that, there, will, not, be, justice, in, cities, unless, they, are, ruled, by, philosopher, kings, those, responsible, for, enforcing, the, laws, are, compelled, to, hold, their, women, children, and, property, in, common, and, the, individual, is, taught, to, pursue, the, common, good, through, noble, lies, the, republic, says, that, such, a, city, is, likely, impossible, however, generally, assuming, that, philosophers, would, refuse, to, rule, and, the, people, would, refuse, to, compel, them, to, do, so, whereas, the, republic, is, premised, on, a, distinction, between, the, sort, of, knowledge, possessed, by, the, philosopher, and, that, possessed, by, the, king, or, political, man, socrates, explores, only, the, character, of, the, philosopher, in, the, statesman, on, the, other, hand, a, participant, referred, to, as, the, eleatic, stranger, discusses, the, sort, of, knowledge, possessed, by, the, political, man, while, socrates, listens, quietly, although, rule, by, a, wise, man, would, be, preferable, to, rule, by, law, the, wise, cannot, help, but, be, judged, by, the, unwise, and, so, in, practice, rule, by, law, is, deemed, necessary, both, the, republic, and, the, statesman, reveal, the, limitations, of, politics, raising, the, question, of, what, political, order, would, be, best, given, those, constraints, that, question, is, addressed, in, the, laws, a, dialogue, that, does, not, take, place, in, athens, and, from, which, socrates, is, absent, the, character, of, the, society, described, there, is, eminently, conservative, a, corrected, or, liberalized, timocracy, on, the, spartan, or, cretan, model, or, that, of, pre, democratic, athens, plato, s, dialogues, also, have, metaphysical, themes, the, most, famous, of, which, is, his, theory, of, forms, it, holds, that, non, material, abstract, but, substantial, forms, or, ideas, and, not, the, material, world, of, change, known, to, us, through, our, physical, senses, possess, the, highest, and, most, fundamental, kind, of, reality, he, argued, extensively, in, the, phaedo, phaedrus, and, republic, for, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, he, believed, specifically, in, reincarnation, plato, often, uses, long, form, analogies, usually, allegories, to, explain, his, ideas, the, most, famous, is, perhaps, the, allegory, of, the, cave, it, likens, most, humans, to, people, tied, up, in, a, cave, who, look, only, at, shadows, on, the, walls, and, have, no, other, conception, of, reality, if, they, turned, around, they, would, see, what, is, casting, the, shadows, and, thereby, gain, a, further, dimension, to, their, reality, if, some, left, the, cave, they, would, see, the, outside, world, illuminated, by, the, sun, representing, the, ultimate, form, of, goodness, and, truth, if, these, travelers, then, re, entered, the, cave, the, people, inside, who, are, still, only, familiar, with, the, shadows, would, not, be, equipped, to, believe, reports, of, this, outside, world, this, story, explains, the, theory, of, forms, with, their, different, levels, of, reality, and, advances, the, view, that, philosopher, kings, are, wisest, while, most, humans, are, ignorant, one, student, of, plato, aristotle, who, would, become, another, of, the, most, influential, philosophers, of, all, time, stressed, the, implication, that, understanding, relies, upon, first, hand, observation, aristotle, moved, to, athens, from, his, native, stageira, in, 367, bc, and, began, to, study, philosophy, perhaps, even, rhetoric, under, isocrates, eventually, enrolling, at, plato, s, academy, he, left, athens, approximately, twenty, years, later, to, study, botany, and, zoology, became, a, tutor, of, alexander, the, great, and, ultimately, returned, to, athens, a, decade, later, to, establish, his, own, school, the, lyceum, at, least, twenty, nine, of, his, treatises, have, survived, known, as, the, corpus, aristotelicum, and, address, a, variety, of, subjects, including, logic, physics, optics, metaphysics, ethics, rhetoric, politics, poetry, botany, and, zoology, aristotle, is, often, portrayed, as, disagreeing, with, his, teacher, plato, e, g, in, raphael, s, school, of, athens, he, criticizes, the, regimes, described, in, plato, s, republic, and, laws, and, refers, to, the, theory, of, forms, as, empty, words, and, poetic, metaphors, he, is, generally, presented, as, giving, greater, weight, to, empirical, observation, and, practical, concerns, aristotle, s, fame, was, not, great, during, the, hellenistic, period, when, stoic, logic, was, in, vogue, but, later, peripatetic, commentators, popularized, his, work, which, eventually, contributed, heavily, to, islamic, jewish, and, medieval, christian, philosophy, his, influence, was, such, that, avicenna, referred, to, him, simply, as, the, master, maimonides, alfarabi, averroes, and, aquinas, as, the, philosopher, aristotle, opposed, the, utopian, style, of, theorizing, deciding, to, rely, on, the, understood, and, observed, behaviors, of, people, in, reality, to, formulate, his, theories, stemming, from, an, underlying, moral, assumption, that, life, is, valuable, the, philosopher, makes, a, point, that, scarce, resources, ought, to, be, responsibly, allocated, to, reduce, poverty, and, death, this, fear, of, goods, led, aristotle, to, exclusively, support, natural, trades, in, which, personal, satiation, was, kept, at, natural, limit, of, consumption, unnatural, trade, as, opposed, to, the, intended, limit, was, classified, as, the, acquisition, of, wealth, to, attain, more, wealth, instead, of, to, purchase, more, goods, cutting, more, along, the, grain, of, reality, aristotle, did, not, only, set, his, mind, on, how, to, give, people, direction, to, make, the, right, choices, but, wanted, each, person, equipped, with, the, tools, to, perform, this, moral, duty, in, his, own, words, property, should, be, in, a, certain, sense, common, but, as, a, general, rule, private, for, when, everyone, has, a, distinct, interest, men, will, not, complain, of, one, another, and, they, will, make, more, progress, because, everyone, will, be, attending, to,

contemporary, their, aim, was, to, live, according, to, nature, and, against, convention, antisthenes, was, inspired, by, the, ascetism, of, socrates, and, accused, plato, of, pride, and, conceit, diogenes, his, follower, took, the, ideas, to, their, limit, living, in, extreme, poverty, and, engaging, in, anti, social, behaviour, crates, of, thebes, was, in, turn, inspired, by, diogenes, to, give, away, his, fortune, and, live, on, the, streets, of, athens, the, cyrenaics, were, founded, by, aristippus, of, cyrene, who, was, a, pupil, of, socrates, the, cyrenaics, were, hedonists, and, held, that, pleasure, was, the, supreme, good, in, life, especially, physical, pleasure, which, they, thought, more, intense, and, more, desirable, than, mental, pleasures, pleasure, is, the, only, good, in, life, and, pain, is, the, only, evil, socrates, had, held, that, virtue, was, the, only, human, good, but, he, had, also, accepted, a, limited, role, for, its, utilitarian, side, allowing, pleasure, to, be, a, secondary, goal, of, moral, action, aristippus, and, his, followers, seized, upon, this, and, made, pleasure, the, sole, final, goal, of, life, denying, that, virtue, had, any, intrinsic, value, the, megarian, school, flourished, in, the, 4th, century, bc, it, was, founded, by, euclides, of, megara, one, of, the, pupils, of, socrates, its, ethical, teachings, were, derived, from, socrates, recognizing, a, single, good, which, was, apparently, combined, with, the, eleatic, doctrine, of, unity, their, work, on, modal, logic, logical, conditionals, and, propositional, logic, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, logic, in, antiquity, and, were, influences, on, the, subsequent, creation, of, stoicism, and, pyrrhonism, during, the, hellenistic, and, roman, periods, many, different, schools, of, thought, developed, in, the, hellenistic, world, and, then, the, greco, roman, world, the, spread, of, christianity, throughout, the, roman, world, followed, by, the, spread, of, islam, ushered, in, the, end, of, hellenistic, philosophy, and, the, beginnings, of, medieval, philosophy, which, was, dominated, by, the, three, abrahamic, traditions, jewish, philosophy, christian, philosophy, and, early, islamic, philosophy, pyrrho, of, elis, a, democritean, philosopher, traveled, to, india, with, alexander, the, great, s, army, where, pyrrho, was, influenced, by, buddhist, teachings, most, particularly, the, three, marks, of, existence, after, returning, to, greece, pyrrho, started, a, new, school, of, philosophy, pyrrhonism, which, taught, that, it, is, one, s, opinions, about, non, evident, matters, i, e, dogma, that, prevent, one, from, attaining, eudaimonia, pyrrhonism, places, the, attainment, of, ataraxia, a, state, of, equanimity, as, the, way, to, achieve, eudaimonia, to, bring, the, mind, to, ataraxia, pyrrhonism, uses, epoch, suspension, of, judgment, regarding, all, non, evident, propositions, pyrrhonists, dispute, that, the, dogmatists, which, includes, all, of, pyrrhonism, s, rival, philosophies, have, found, truth, regarding, non, evident, matters, for, any, non, evident, matter, a, pyrrhonist, makes, arguments, for, and, against, such, that, the, matter, cannot, be, concluded, thus, suspending, belief, and, thereby, inducing, ataraxia, epicurus, studied, in, athens, with, nausiphanes, who, was, a, follower, of, democritus, and, a, student, of, pyrrho, of, elis, he, accepted, democritus, theory, of, atomism, with, improvements, made, in, response, to, criticisms, by, aristotle, and, others, his, ethics, were, based, on, the, pursuit, of, pleasure, and, the, avoidance, of, pain, this, was, however, not, simple, hedonism, as, he, noted, that, we, do, not, mean, the, pleasures, of, the, prodigal, or, of, sensuality, we, mean, the, absence, of, pain, in, the, body, and, trouble, in, the, mind, the, founder, of, stoicism, zeno, of, citium, was, taught, by, crates, of, thebes, and, he, took, up, the, cynic, ideals, of, continence, and, self, mastery, but, applied, the, concept, of, apatheia, indifference, to, personal, circumstances, rather, than, social, norms, and, switched, shameless, flouting, of, the, latter, for, a, resolute, fulfillment, of, social, duties, logic, and, physics, were, also, part, of, early, stoicism, further, developed, by, zeno, s, successors, cleanthes, and, chrysippus, their, metaphysics, was, based, in, materialism, which, was, structured, by, logos, reason, but, also, called, god, or, fate, their, logical, contributions, still, feature, in, contemporary, propositional, calculus, their, ethics, was, based, on, pursuing, happiness, which, they, believed, was, a, product, of, living, in, accordance, with, nature, this, meant, accepting, those, things, which, one, could, not, change, one, could, therefore, choose, whether, to, be, happy, or, not, by, adjusting, one, s, attitude, towards, their, circumstances, as, the, freedom, from, fears, and, desires, was, happiness, itself, around, 266, bc, arcesilaus, became, head, of, the, platonic, academy, and, adopted, skepticism, as, a, central, tenet, of, platonism, making, platonism, nearly, the, same, as, pyrrhonism, after, arcesilaus, academic, skepticism, diverged, from, pyrrhonism, this, skeptical, period, of, ancient, platonism, from, arcesilaus, to, philo, of, larissa, became, known, as, the, new, academy, although, some, ancient, authors, added, further, subdivisions, such, as, a, middle, academy, the, academic, skeptics, did, not, doubt, the, existence, of, truth, they, just, doubted, that, humans, had, the, capacities, for, obtaining, it, they, based, this, position, on, plato, s, phaedo, sections, 64, 67, in, which, socrates, discusses, how, knowledge, is, not, accessible, to, mortals, while, the, objective, of, the, pyrrhonists, was, the, attainment, of, ataraxia, after, arcesilaus, the, academic, skeptics, did, not, hold, up, ataraxia, as, the, central, objective, the, academic, skeptics, focused, on, criticizing, the, dogmas, of, other, schools, of, philosophy, in, particular, of, the, dogmatism, of, the, stoics, they, acknowledged, some, vestiges, of, a, moral, law, within, at, best, but, a, plausible, guide, the, possession, of, which, however, formed, the, real, distinction, between, the, sage, and, the, fool, slight, as, the, difference, may, appear, between, the, positions, of, the, academic, skeptics, and, the, pyrrhonists, a, comparison, of, their, lives, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, a, practical, philosophical, moderation, was, the, characteristic, of, the, academic, skeptics, whereas, the, objectives, of, the, pyrrhonists, were, more, psychological, following, the, end, of, the, skeptical, period, of, the, academy, with, antiochus, of, ascalon, platonic, thought, entered, the, period, of, middle, platonism, which, absorbed, ideas, from, the, peripatetic, and, stoic, schools, more, extreme, syncretism, was, done, by, numenius, of, apamea, who, combined, it, with, neopythagoreanism, also, affected, by, the, neopythagoreans, the, neoplatonists, first, of, them, plotinus, argued, that, mind, exists, before, matter, and, that, the, universe, has, a, singular, cause, which, must, therefore, be, a, single, mind, as, such, neoplatonism, became, essentially, a, religion, and, had, great, impact, on, gnosticism, and, christian, theology, during, the, middle, ages, greek, ideas, were, largely, forgotten, in, western, europe, due, to, the, decline, in, literacy, during, the, migration, period, in, the, byzantine, empire, however, greek, ideas, were, preserved, and, studied, islamic, philosophers, such, as, al, kindi, alkindus, al, farabi, alpharabius, ibn, sina, avicenna, and, ibn, rushd, averroes, also, reinterpreted, these, works, after, the, caliphs, authorized, the, gathering, of, greek, manuscripts, and, hired, translators, to, increase, their, prestige, during, the, high, middle, ages, greek, philosophy, re, entered, the, west, through, both, translations, from, arabic, to, latin, and, original, greek, manuscripts, from, the, byzantine, empire, the, re, introduction, of, these, philosophies, accompanied, by, the, new, arabic, commentaries, had, a, great, influence, on, medieval, philosophers, such, as, thomas, aquinas
