hajj, at, some, other, point, in, their, lifetime, if, they, have, the, means, to, do, so, according, to, the, official, published, statistics, between, 2000, and, 2019, the, average, number, of,

161, 573, in, june, 2020, while, not, cancelling, the, hajj, outright, the, saudi, government, announced, that, they, would, only, welcome, very, limited, numbers, of, pilgrims, who, are, residents, of, saudi, arabia, due, to, the, global, covid, 19, pandemic, similar, restrictions, applied, in, 2021, but, women, were, permitted, to, attend, without, a, male, guardian, mahram, provided, they, went, in, a, trustworthy, group, the, word, in, arabic, ajj, is, similar, to, the, hebrew, ag, which, means, festival, from, the, triliteral, semitic, root, the, term, was, used, to, refer, to, the, three, pilgrimage, festivals, israelites, would, make, to, the, temple, in, jerusalem, each, year, similarly, the, arabic, ajj, in, islam, refers, to, act, of, traveling, to, mecca, to, perform, the, various, rituals, associated, with, the, pilgrimage, the, present, pattern, of, hajj, was, established, by, muhammad, however, according, to, the, quran, elements, of, hajj, trace, back, to, the, time, of, abraham, according, to, islamic, tradition, abraham, was, ordered, by, god, to, leave, his, wife, hajar, and, his, son, ishmael, alone, in, the, desert, of, ancient, mecca, in, search, of, water, hajar, desperately, ran, seven, times, between, the, two, hills, of, safa, and, marwah, but, found, none, returning, in, despair, to, ishmael, she, saw, the, baby, scratching, the, ground, with, his, leg, and, a, water, fountain, sprang, forth, underneath, his, foot, later, abraham, was, commanded, to, build, the, kaaba, which, he, did, with, the, help, of, ishmael, and, to, invite, people, to, perform, pilgrimage, there, the, quran, refers, to, these, incidents, in, verses, 2, 124, 127, and, 22, 27, 30, according, to, the, tafsir, of, zamakhshari, d, 1144, c, e, the, archangel, gabriel, brought, the, black, stone, from, heaven, to, be, attached, to, the, kaaba, when, it, was, built, by, the, prophet, abraham, in, pre, islamic, arabia, a, time, known, as, age, of, ignorance, jahiliyya, the, kaaba, became, surrounded, by, pagan, idols, in, ad, 630, muhammad, led, his, followers, from, medina, to, mecca, cleansed, the, kaaba, by, destroying, all, the, pagan, idols, and, then, consecrated, the, building, to, god, in, ad, 632, muhammad, performed, his, only, and, last, pilgrimage, with, a, large, number, of, followers, and, instructed, them, on, the, rites, of, hajj, it, was, from, this, point, that, hajj, became, one, of, the, five, pillars, of, islam, during, medieval, times, pilgrims, would, gather, in, the, big, cities, of, syria, egypt, and, iraq, to, go, to, mecca, in, groups, and, caravans, comprising, tens, of, thousands, of, pilgrims, often, under, state, patronage, hajj, caravans, particularly, with, the, advent, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, and, its, successor, the, ottoman, empire, were, escorted, by, a, military, force, accompanied, by, physicians, under, the, command, of, an, amir, al, hajj, this, was, done, to, protect, the, caravan, from, bedouin, robbers, or, natural, hazards, and, to, ensure, that, the, pilgrims, were, supplied, with, the, necessary, provisions, muslim, travelers, like, ibn, jubayr, and, ibn, battuta, have, recorded, detailed, accounts, of, hajj, journeys, in, medieval, times, the, caravans, followed, well, established, routes, called, in, arabic, darb, al, hajj, lit, pilgrimage, road, which, usually, followed, ancient, routes, such, as, the, king, s, highway, the, date, of, hajj, is, determined, by, the, islamic, calendar, known, as, the, hijri, calendar, or, ah, which, is, based, on, the, lunar, year, every, year, the, events, of, hajj, take, place, in, a, ten, day, period, starting, on, 1, and, ending, on, 10, dhu, al, hijjah, the, twelfth, and, last, month, of, the, islamic, calendar, among, these, ten, days, the, 9th, dhul, hijjah, is, known, as, day, of, arafah, and, this, day, is, called, the, day, of, hajj, because, the, islamic, calendar, is, lunar, and, the, islamic, year, is, about, eleven, days, shorter, than, the, gregorian, year, the, gregorian, date, for, hajj, changes, from, year, to, year, thus, each, year, in, the, gregorian, calendar, the, pilgrimage, starts, eleven, days, sometimes, ten, days, earlier, this, makes, it, possible, for, the, hajj, season, to, fall, twice, in, one, gregorian, year, and, it, does, so, every, 33, years, the, last, time, this, phenomenon, occurred, was, in, 2006, the, table, below, shows, the, gregorian, dates, of, hajj, in, recent, years, the, dates, correspond, to, 9, dhul, hijjah, of, the, hijri, calendar, prospective, dates, are, approximate, fiqh, literature, describes, in, detail, the, manners, of, carrying, out, the, rites, of, hajj, and, pilgrims, generally, follow, handbooks, and, expert, guides, to,

with, abraham, ihram, is, the, name, given, to, the, special, spiritual, state, state, of, holiness, which, marks, the, start, of, the, ritual, of, hajj, for, each, person, ihram, is, initiated, upon, the, arrival, to, the, miqat, or, prior, to, reaching, it, depending, on, where, they, have, come, from, when, pilgrims, enter, into, the, state, of, ihram, they, are, required, to, abstain, from, certain, actions, while, in, ihram, males, are, required, to, wear, two, white, seamless, cloths, with, one, wrapped, around, the, waist, reaching, below, the, knee, and, the, other, draped, over, the, left, shoulder, and, tied, at, the, right, side, for, females, this, involves, wearing, ordinary, dress, that, fulfills, the, islamic, condition, of, public, dress, with, hands, and, face,

difference, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, donning, such, unsewn, white, garments, entirely, is, believed, to, distance, man, from, material, ostentation, and, engross, him, in, a, world, of, purity, and, spirituality, since, clothes, are, believed, to, show, individuality, and, distinction, and, create, superficial, barriers, that, separate, individuals, the, garments, of, ihram, are, seen, as, the, antithesis, of, that, individualism, ihram, clothing, is, also, a, reminder, of, shrouds, worn, after, death, the, ritual, of, tawaf, involves, walking, seven, times, counterclockwise,

hateem, an, area, at, the, north, side, of, the, kaaba, inside, their, path, each, circuit, starts, and, ends, with, the, kissing, or, touching, of, the, black, stone, pilgrims, also, point, to, the, stone, and, recite, a, prayer, known, as, talbiyah, if, kissing, or, touching, the, stone, is, not, possible, because, of, crowds, pilgrims, may, simply, point, towards, the, stone, with, their, right, hand, on, each, circuit, eating, is, not, permitted, but, the, drinking, of, water, is, permitted, and, encouraged, because, of, the, risk, of, dehydration, men, are, encouraged, to, perform, the, first, three, circuits, at, a, hurried, pace, known, as, ramal, and, the, following, four, at, a, more, leisurely, pace, the, completion, of, tawaf, is, followed, by, two, rakaat, prayers, at, the, place, of, abraham, muqam, ibrahim, a, site, near, the, kaaba, inside, the, mosque, however, again, because, of, large, crowds, during, the, days, of, hajj, they, may, instead, pray, anywhere, in, the, mosque, after, prayer, pilgrims, also, drink, water, from, the, zamzam, well, which, is, made, available, in, coolers, throughout, the, mosque, although, the, circuits, around, the, kaaba, are, traditionally, done, on, the, ground, level, tawaf, is, now, also, performed, on, the, first, floor, and, roof, of, the, mosque, because, of, the, large, crowds, this, rite, is, said, to, be, the, manifestation, of, tawhid, the, oneness, of, god, the, heart, and, soul, of, the, pilgrim, should, move, around, kaaba, the, symbol, of, the, house, of, god, in, a, way, that, no, worldly,

mount, arafat, on, the, 8th, day, of, dhu, al, hijjah, if, pilgrims, wanted, to, stay, at, arafat, they, would, have, prepared, water, from, mecca, and, carried, it, by, themselves, there, so, they, told, each, other, to, drink, enough, finally, this, day, called, tarwiyah, that, means, to, quench, thirst, in, the, arabic, language, tarwiyah, day, is, the, first, day, of, hajj, ritual, also, on,

contains, the, tomb, of, muhammad, the, quba, mosque, and, masjid, al, qiblatayn, are, also, usually, visited, to, muslims, hajj, is, associated, with, religious, as, well, as, social, significance, the, obligation, for, performing, this, pilgrimage, is, only, fulfilled, if, it, is, done, on, the, eighth, to, twelfth, day, of, the, last, month, of, the, islamic, calendar, if, in, a, given, year, an, adult, muslim, is, in, good, health, and, their, life, and, wealth, are, safe, they, must, perform, the, hajj, in, the, same, year, delaying, it, is, considered, sinful, unless, the, delay, is, caused, by, reasons, beyond, their, control, apart, from, being, an, obligatory, religious, duty, the, hajj, is, seen, to, have, a, spiritual, merit, that, provides, muslims, with, an, opportunity, of, self, renewal, hajj, serves, as, a, reminder, of, the, day, of, judgment, when, muslims, believe, people, will, stand, before, god, hadith, literature, sayings, of, muhammad, lists, various, merits, a, pilgrim, achieves, upon, successful, completion, of, their, hajj, after, successful, pilgrimage, pilgrims, can, prefix, their, names, with, the, title, al, hajji, and, are, held, with, respect, in, muslim, society, however, islamic, scholars, suggest, hajj, should, signify, a, muslim, s, religious, commitment, and, should, not, be, a, measurement, of, their, social, status, hajj, brings, together, and, unites, the, muslims, from, different, parts, of, the, world, irrespective, of, their, race, colour, and, culture, which, acts, as, a, symbol, of, equality, a, 2008, study, on, the, impact, of, participating, in, the, islamic, pilgrimage, found, that, muslim, communities, become, more, positive, and, tolerant, after, hajj, titled, estimating, the, impact, of, the, hajj, religion, and, tolerance, in, islam, s, global, gathering, and, conducted, in, conjunction, with, harvard, university, s, john, f, kennedy, school, of, government, the, study, noted, that, the, hajj, increases, belief, in, equality, and, harmony, among, ethnic, groups, and, islamic, sects, and, leads, to, more, favourable, attitudes, toward, women, including, greater, acceptance, of, female, education, and, employment, and, that, hajjis, show, increased, belief, in, peace, equality, and, harmony, among, adherents, of, different, religions, malcolm, x, an, american, activist, during, the, civil, rights, movement, describes, the, sociological, atmosphere, he, experienced, at, his, hajj, in, the, 1960s, as, follows, there, were, tens, of, thousands, of, pilgrims, from, all, over, the, world, they, were, of, all, colors, from, blue, eyed, blondes, to, black, skinned, africans, but, we, were, all, participating, in, the, same, ritual, displaying, a, spirit, of, unity, and, brotherhood, that, my, experiences, in, america, had, led, me, to, believe, never, could, exist, between, the, white, and, the, non, white, america, needs, to, understand, islam, because, this, is, the, one, religion, that, erases, from, its, society, the, race, problem, you, may, be, shocked, by, these, words, coming, from, me, but, on, this, pilgrimage, what, i, have, seen, and, experienced, has, forced, me, to, rearrange, much, of, my, thought, patterns, previously, held, most, of, the, hajj, related, issues, are, handled, by, the, ministry, of, hajj, and, umrah, making, necessary, arrangements, each, year, for, the, growing, number, of, pilgrims, poses, a, logistic, challenge, for, the, government, of, saudi, arabia, which, has, since, the, 1950s, spent, more, than, 100, billion, to, increase, pilgrimage, facilities, major, issues, like, housing, transportation, sanitation, and, health, care, have, been, addressed, and, improved, greatly, by, the, government, by, introducing, various, development, programs, with, the, result, that, pilgrims, now, enjoy, modern, facilities, and, perform, various, rites, at, ease, the, saudi, government, often, sets, quotas, for, various, countries, to, keep, the, pilgrims, number, at, a, manageable, level, and, arranges, huge, security, forces, and, cctv, cameras, to, maintain, overall, safety, during, hajj, various, institutions, and, government, programs, such, as, the, haj, subsidy, offered, in, pakistan, or, the, tabung, haji, based, in, malaysia, assist, pilgrims, in, covering, the, costs, of, the, journey,
