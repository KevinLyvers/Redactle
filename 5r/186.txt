the, consequences, of, turning, away, from, god, the, books, that, compose, the, old, testament, canon, and, their, order, and, names, differ, between, various, branches, of, christianity, the, canons, of, the, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, comprise, up, to, 49, books, the, catholic, canon, comprises, 46, books, and, the, most, common, of, the, protestant, canons,

are, some, differences, in, text, the, greater, count, of, books, reflects, the, splitting, of, several, texts, samuel, kings, chronicles, ezra, nehemiah, and, the, twelve, minor, prophets, into, separate, books, in, christian, bibles, the, books, that, are, part, of, the, christian, old, testament, but, that, are, not, part, of, the, hebrew, canon, are, sometimes, described, as, deuterocanonical, books, in, general, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, include, these, books, in, the, old, testament, most, protestant, bibles, do, not, include, the, deuterocanonical, books, in, their, canon, but, some, versions, of, anglican, and, lutheran, bibles, place, such, books, in, a, separate, section, called, apocrypha, these, books, are, ultimately, derived, from, the, earlier, septuagint, the, earliest, extant, greek, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, and, are, also, jewish, in, origin, some, are, also, contained, in, the, dead, sea, scrolls, the, old, testament, contains, 39, protestant, 46, catholic, or, more, orthodox, and, other, books, divided, very, broadly, into, the, pentateuch, torah, the, historical, books, the, wisdom, books, and, the, prophets,

version, references, some, of, these, books, by, the, traditional, spelling, when, referring, to, them, in, the, new, testament, such, as, esaias, for, isaiah, in, the, spirit, of, ecumenism, more, recent, catholic, translations, e, g, the, new, american, bible, jerusalem, bible, and, ecumenical, translations, used, by, catholics, such, as, the, revised, standard, version, catholic, edition,

instead, of, 1, 4, kings, in, those, books, which, are, universally, considered, canonical, the, protocanonicals, the, talmud, the, jewish, commentary, on, the, scriptures, in, bava, batra, 14b, gives, a, different, order, for, the, books, in, nevi, im, and, ketuvim, this, order, is, also, cited, in, mishneh, torah, hilchot, sefer, torah, 7, 15, the, order, of, the, books, of, the, torah, is, universal, through, all, denominations, of, judaism, and, christianity, the, disputed, books, included, in, most, canons, but, not, in, others, are, often, called, the, biblical, apocrypha, a, term, that, is, sometimes, used, specifically, to, describe, the, books, in, the, catholic, and, orthodox, canons, that, are, absent, from, the, jewish, masoretic, text, and, most, modern, protestant, bibles, catholics, following, the, canon, of, trent, 1546, describe, these, books, as, deuterocanonical, while, greek, orthodox, christians, following, the, synod, of, jerusalem, 1672, use, the, traditional, name, of, anagignoskomena, meaning, that, which, is, to, be, read, they, are, present, in, a, few, historic, protestant, versions, the, german, luther, bible, included, such, books, as, did, the, english, 1611, king, james, version, empty, table, cells, indicate, that, a, book, is, absent, from, that, canon, several, of, the, books, in, the, eastern, orthodox, canon, are, also, found, in, the, appendix, to, the, latin, vulgate, formerly, the, official, bible, of, the, roman, catholic, church, some, of, the, stories, of, the, pentateuch, may, derive, from, older, sources, scholars, such, as, andrew, r, george, point, out, the, similarity, of, the, genesis, flood, narrative, and, the, gilgamesh, flood, myth, similarities, between, the, origin, story, of, moses, and, that, of, sargon, of, akkad, were, noted, by, psychoanalyst, otto, rank, in, 1909, and, popularized, by, 20th, century, writers, such, as, h, g, wells, and, joseph, campbell, jacob, bronowski, writes, that, the, bible, is, part, folklore, and, part, record, history, is, written, by, the, victors, and, the, israelis, when, they, burst, through, became, the, carriers, of, history, in, 2007, a, historian, of, ancient, judaism, lester, l, grabbe, explained, that, earlier, biblical, scholars, such, as, julius, wellhausen, 1844, 1918, could, be, described, as, maximalist, accepting, biblical, text, unless, it, has, been, disproven, continuing, in, this, tradition, both, the, substantial, historicity, of, the, patriarchs, and, the, unified, conquest, of, the, land, were, widely, accepted, in, the, united, states, until, about, the, 1970s, contrarily, grabbe, says, that, those, in, his, field, now, are, all, minimalists, at, least, when, it, comes, to, the, patriarchal, period, and, the, settlement, ery, few, are, willing, to, operate, in, 2022, archaeologist, avraham, faust, wrote, that, in, the, 1990s, a, school, known, as, biblical, minimalism, rejected, the, historical, value, of, the, bible, for, the, study, of, ancient, israel, during, the, iron, age, but, this, extreme, approach, was, rejected, by, mainstream, scholarship, the, first, five, books, genesis, exodus, leviticus, book, of, numbers, and, deuteronomy, reached, their, present, form, in, the, persian, period, 538, 332, bc, and, their, authors, were, the, elite, of, exilic, returnees, who, controlled, the, temple, at, that, time, the, books, of, joshua, judges, samuel, and, kings, follow, forming, a, history, of, israel, from, the, conquest, of, canaan, to, the, siege, of, jerusalem, c, 587, bc, there, is, a, broad, consensus, among, scholars, that, these, originated, as, a, single, work, the, so, called, deuteronomistic, history, during, the, babylonian, exile, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, two, books, of, chronicles, cover, much, the, same, material, as, the, pentateuch, and, deuteronomistic, history, and, probably, date, from, the, 4th, century, bc, chronicles, and, ezra, nehemiah, was, probably, finished, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, catholic, and, orthodox, old, testaments, contain, two, catholic, old, testament, to, four, orthodox, books, of, the, maccabees, written, in, the, 2nd, and, 1st, centuries, bc, these, history, books, make, up, around, half, the, total, content, of, the, old, testament, of, the, remainder, the, books, of, the, various, prophets, isaiah, jeremiah, ezekiel, and, the, twelve, minor, prophets, were, written, between, the, 8th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, with, the, exceptions, of, jonah, and, daniel, which, were, written, much, later, the, wisdom, books, job, proverbs, ecclesiastes, psalms, song, of, songs, have, various, dates, proverbs, possibly, was, completed, by, the, hellenistic, time, 332, 198, bc, though, containing, much, older, material, as, well, job, was, completed, by, the, 6th, century, bc, ecclesiastes, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, throughout, the, old, testament, god, is, consistently, depicted, as, the, one, who, created, the, world, although, the, god, of, the, old, testament, is, not, consistently, presented, as, the, only, god, who, exists, he, is, always, depicted, as, the, only, god, whom, israel, is, to, worship, or, the, one, true, god, that, only, yahweh, or, yhwh, is, almighty, the, old, testament, stresses, the, special, relationship, between, god, and, his, chosen, people, israel, but, includes, instructions, for, proselytes, as, well, this, relationship, is, expressed, in, the, biblical, covenant, contract, between, the, two, received, by, moses, the, law, codes, in, books, such, as, exodus, and, especially, deuteronomy, are, the, terms, of, the, contract, israel, swears, faithfulness, to, god, and, god, swears, to, be, israel, s, special, protector, and, supporter, however, the, jewish, study, bible, denies, that, the, word, covenant, brit, in, hebrew, means, contract, in, the, ancient, near, east, a, covenant, would, have, been, sworn, before, the, gods, who, would, be, its, enforcers, as, god, is, part, of, the, agreement, and, not, merely, witnessing, it, the, jewish, study, bible, instead, interprets, the, term, to, refer, to, a, pledge, further, themes, in, the, old, testament, include, salvation, redemption, divine, judgment, obedience, and, disobedience, faith, and, faithfulness, among, others, throughout, there, is, a, strong, emphasis, on, ethics, and, ritual, purity, both, of, which, god, demands, although, some, of, the, prophets, and, wisdom, writers, seem, to, question, this, arguing, that, god, demands, social, justice, above, purity, and, perhaps, does, not, even, care, about, purity, at, all, the, old, testament, s, moral, code, enjoins, fairness, intervention, on, behalf, of, the, vulnerable, and, the, duty, of, those, in, power, to, administer, justice, righteously, it, forbids, murder, bribery, and, corruption, deceitful, trading, and, many, sexual, misdemeanours, all, morality, is, traced, back, to, god, who, is, the, source, of, all, goodness, the, problem, of, evil, plays, a, large, part, in, the, old, testament, the, problem, the, old, testament, authors, faced, was, that, a, good, god, must, have, had, just, reason, for, bringing, disaster, meaning, notably, but, not, only, the, babylonian, exile, upon, his, people, the, theme, is, played, out, with, many, variations, in, books, as, different, as, the, histories, of, kings, and, chronicles, the, prophets, like, ezekiel, and, jeremiah, and, in, the, wisdom, books, like, job, and, ecclesiastes, the, process, by, which, scriptures, became, canons, and, bibles, was, a, long, one, and, its, complexities, account, for, the, many, different, old, testaments, which, exist, today, timothy, h, lim, a, professor, of, hebrew, bible, and, second, temple, judaism, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, identifies, the, old, testament, as, a, collection, of, authoritative, texts, of, apparently, divine, origin, that, went, through, a, human, process, of, writing, and, editing, he, states, that, it, is, not, a, magical, book, nor, was, it, literally, written, by, god, and, passed, to, mankind, by, about, the, 5th, century, bc, jews, saw, the, five, books, of, the, torah, the, old, testament, pentateuch, as, having, authoritative, status, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, prophets, had, a, similar, status, although, without, quite, the, same, level, of, respect, as, the, torah, beyond, that, the, jewish, scriptures, were, fluid, with, different, groups, seeing, authority, in, different, books, hebrew, texts, began, to, be, translated, into, greek, in, alexandria, in, about, 280, bc, and, continued, until, about, 130, bc, these, early, greek, translations, supposedly, commissioned, by, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, were, called, the, septuagint, latin, for, seventy, from, the, supposed, number, of, translators, involved, hence, its, abbreviation, lxx, this, septuagint, remains, the, basis, of, the, old, testament, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, it, varies, in, many, places, from, the, masoretic, text, and, includes, numerous, books, no, longer, considered, canonical, in, some, traditions, 1, esdras, judith, tobit, the, books, of, maccabees, the, book, of, wisdom, sirach, and, baruch, early, modern, biblical, criticism, typically, explained, these, variations, as, intentional, or, ignorant, corruptions, by, the, alexandrian, scholars, but, most, recent, scholarship, holds, it, is, simply, based, on, early, source, texts, differing, from, those, later, used, by, the, masoretes, in, their, work, the, septuagint, was, originally, used, by, hellenized, jews, whose, knowledge, of, greek, was, better, than, hebrew, however, the, texts, came, to, be, used, predominantly, by, gentile, converts, to, christianity, and, by, the, early, church, as, its, scripture, greek, being, the, lingua, franca, of, the, early, church, the, three, most, acclaimed, early, interpreters, were, aquila, of, sinope, symmachus, the, ebionite, and, theodotion, in, his, hexapla, origen, placed, his, edition, of, the, hebrew, text, beside, its, transcription, in, greek, letters, and, four, parallel, translations, aquila, s, symmachus, s, the, septuagint, s, and, theodotion, s, the, so, called, fifth, and, sixth, editions, were, two, other, greek, translations, supposedly, miraculously, discovered, by, students, outside, the, towns, of, jericho, and, nicopolis, these, were, added, to, origen, s, octapla, in, 331, constantine, i, commissioned, eusebius, to, deliver, fifty, bibles, for, the, church, of, constantinople, athanasius, recorded, alexandrian, scribes, around, 340, preparing, bibles, for, constans, little, else, is, known, though, there, is, plenty, of, speculation, for, example, it, is, speculated, that, this, may, have, provided, motivation, for, canon, lists, and, that, codex, vaticanus, and, codex, sinaiticus, are, examples, of, these, bibles, together, with, the, peshitta, and, codex, alexandrinus, these, are, the, earliest, extant, christian, bibles, there, is, no, evidence, among, the, canons, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, of, any, determination, on, the, canon, however, jerome, 347, 420, in, his, prologue, to, judith, claims, that, the, book, of, judith, was, found, by, the, nicene, council, to, have, been, counted, among, the, number, of, the, sacred, scriptures, in, western, christianity, or, christianity, in, the, western, half, of, the, roman, empire, latin, had, displaced, greek, as, the, common, language, of, the, early, christians, and, in, 382, ad, pope, damasus, i, commissioned, jerome, the, leading, scholar, of, the, day, to, produce, an, updated, latin, bible, to, replace, the, vetus, latina, which, was, a, latin, translation, of, the, septuagint, jerome, s, work, called, the, vulgate, was, a, direct, translation, from, hebrew, since, he, argued, for, the, superiority, of, the, hebrew, texts, in, correcting, the, septuagint, on, both, philological, and, theological, grounds, his, vulgate, old, testament, became, the, standard, bible, used, in, the, western, church, specifically, as, the, sixto, clementine, vulgate, while, the, churches, in, the, east, continued, and, continue, to, use, the, septuagint, jerome, however, in, the, vulgate, s, prologues, describes, some, portions, of, books, in, the, septuagint, not, found, in, the, hebrew, bible, as, being, non, canonical, he, called, them, apocrypha, for, baruch, he, mentions, by, name, in, his, prologue, to, jeremiah, and, notes, that, it, is, neither, read, nor, held, among, the, hebrews, but, does, not, explicitly, call, it, apocryphal, or, not, in, the, canon, the, synod, of, hippo, in, 393, followed, by, the, council, of, carthage, 397, and, the, council, of, carthage, 419, may, be, the, first, council, that, explicitly, accepted, the, first, canon, which, includes, the, books, that, did, not, appear, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, councils, were, under, significant, influence, of, augustine, of, hippo, who, regarded, the, canon, as, already, closed, in, the, 16th, century, the, protestant, reformers, sided, with, jerome, yet, although, most, protestant, bibles, now, have, only, those, books, that, appear, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, order, is, that, of, the, greek, bible, rome, then, officially, adopted, a, canon, the, canon, of, trent, which, is, seen, as, following, augustine, s, carthaginian, councils, or, the, council, of, rome, and, includes, most, but, not, all, of, the, septuagint, 3, ezra, and, 3, and, 4, maccabees, are, excluded, the, anglicans, after, the, english, civil, war, adopted, a, compromise, position, restoring, the, 39, articles, and, keeping, the, extra, books, that, were, excluded, by, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, both, for, private, study, and, for, reading, in, churches, but, not, for, establishing, any, doctrine, while, lutherans, kept, them, for, private, study, gathered, in, an, appendix, as, biblical, apocrypha, while, the, hebrew, greek, and, latin, versions, of, the, hebrew, bible, are, the, best, known, old, testaments, there, were, others, at, much, the, same, time, as, the, septuagint, was, being, produced, translations, were, being, made, into, aramaic, the, language, of, jews, living, in, palestine, and, the, near, east, and, likely, the, language, of, jesus, these, are, called, the, aramaic, targums, from, a, word, meaning, translation, and, were, used, to, help, jewish, congregations, understand, their, scriptures, for, aramaic, christians, there, was, a, syriac, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, called, the, peshitta, as, well, as, versions, in, coptic, the, everyday, language, of, egypt, in, the, first, christian, centuries, descended, from, ancient, egyptian, ethiopic, for, use, in, the, ethiopian, church, one, of, the, oldest, christian, churches, armenian, armenia, was, the, first, to, adopt, christianity, as, its, official, religion, and, arabic, christianity, is, based, on, the, belief, that, the, historical, jesus, is, also, the, christ, as, in, the, confession, of, peter, this, belief, is, in, turn, based, on, jewish, understandings, of, the, meaning, of, the, hebrew, term, messiah, which, like, the, greek, christ, means, anointed, in, the, hebrew, scriptures, it, describes, a, king, anointed, with, oil, on, his, accession, to, the, throne, he, becomes, the, l, ord, s, anointed, or, yahweh, s, anointed, by, the, time, of, jesus, some, jews, expected, that, a, flesh, and, blood, descendant, of, david, the, son, of, david, would, come, to, establish, a, real, jewish, kingdom, in, jerusalem, instead, of, the, roman, province, of, judaea, others, stressed, the, son, of, man, a, distinctly, other, worldly, figure, who, would, appear, as, a, judge, at, the, end, of, time, some, expounded, a, synthesised, view, of, both, positions, where, a, messianic, kingdom, of, this, world, would, last, for, a, set, period, and, be, followed, by, the, other, worldly, age, or, world, to, come, some, thought, the, messiah, was, already, present, but, unrecognised, due, to, israel, s, sins, some, thought, that, the, messiah, would, be, announced, by, a, forerunner, probably, elijah, as, promised, by, the, prophet, malachi, whose, book, now, ends, the, old, testament, and, precedes, mark, s, account, of, john, the, baptist, however, no, view, of, the, messiah, as, based, on, the, old, testament, predicted, a, messiah, who, would, suffer, and, die, for, the, sins, of, all, people, the, story, of, jesus, death, therefore, involved, a, profound, shift, in, meaning, from, the, old, testament, tradition, the, name, old, testament, reflects, christianity, s, understanding, of, itself, as, the, fulfillment, of, jeremiah, s, prophecy, of, a, new, covenant, which, is, similar, to, testament, and, often, conflated, to, replace, the, existing, covenant, between, god, and, israel, jeremiah, 31, 31, the, emphasis, however, has, shifted, from, judaism, s, understanding, of, the, covenant, as, a, racially, or, tribally, based, pledge, between, god, and, the, jewish, people, to, one, between, god, and, any, person, of, faith, who, is, in, christ
