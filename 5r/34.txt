https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism
in, moral, philosophy, consequentialism, is, a, class, of, normative, teleological, ethical, theories, that, holds, that, the, consequences, of, one, s, conduct, are, the, ultimate, basis, for, judgement, about, the, rightness, or, wrongness, of, that, conduct, thus, from, a, consequentialist, standpoint, a, morally, right, act, including, omission, from, acting, is, one, that, will, produce, a, good, outcome, consequentialism, along, with, eudaimonism, falls, under, the, broader, category, of, teleological, ethics, a, group, of, views, which, claim, that, the, moral, value, of, any, act, consists, in, its, tendency, to, produce, things, of, intrinsic, value, consequentialists, hold, in, general, that, an, act, is, right, if, and, only, if, the, act, or, in, some, views, the, rule, under, which, it, falls, will, produce, will, probably, produce, or, is, intended, to, produce, a, greater, balance, of, good, over, evil, than, any, available, alternative, different, consequentialist, theories, differ, in, how, they, define, moral, goods, with, chief, candidates, including, pleasure, the, absence, of, pain, the, satisfaction, of, one, s, preferences, and, broader, notions, of, the, general, good, consequentialism, is, usually, contrasted, with, deontological, ethics, or, deontology, deontology, in, which, rules, and, moral, duty, are, central, derives, the, rightness, or, wrongness, of, one, s, conduct, from, the, character, of, the, behaviour, itself, rather, than, the, outcomes, of, the, conduct, it, is, also, contrasted, with, both, virtue, ethics, which, focuses, on, the, character, of, the, agent, rather, than, on, the, nature, or, consequences, of, the, act, or, omission, itself, and, pragmatic, ethics, which, treats, morality, like, science, advancing, collectively, as, a, society, over, the, course, of, many, lifetimes, such, that, any, moral, criterion, is, subject, to, revision, some, argue, that, consequentialist, theories, such, as, utilitarianism, and, deontological, theories, such, as, kantian, ethics, are, not, necessarily, mutually, exclusive, for, example, t, m, scanlon, advances, the, idea, that, human, rights, which, are, commonly, considered, a, deontological, concept, can, only, be, justified, with, reference, to, the, consequences, of, having, those, rights, similarly, robert, nozick, argued, for, a, theory, that, is, mostly, consequentialist, but, incorporates, inviolable, side, constraints, which, restrict, the, sort, of, actions, agents, are, permitted, to, do, derek, parfit, argued, that, in, practice, when, understood, properly, rule, consequentialism, kantian, deontology, and, contractualism, would, all, end, up, prescribing, the, same, behavior, the, term, consequentialism, was, coined, by, g, e, m, anscombe, in, her, essay, modern, moral, philosophy, in, 1958, however, the, meaning, of, the, word, has, changed, over, the, time, since, anscombe, used, it, in, the, sense, she, coined, it, she, had, explicitly, placed, j, s, mill, in, the, nonconsequentialist, and, w, d, ross, in, the, consequentialist, camp, whereas, in, the, contemporary, sense, of, the, word, they, would, be, classified, the, other, way, round, this, is, due, to, changes, in, the, meaning, of, the, word, not, due, to, changes, in, perceptions, of, w, d, ross, s, and, j, s, mill, s, views, one, common, view, is, to, classify, consequentialism, together, with, virtue, ethics, under, a, broader, label, of, teleological, ethics, proponents, of, teleological, ethics, greek, telos, end, purpose, logos, science, argue, that, the, moral, value, of, any, act, consists, in, its, tendency, to, produce, things, of, intrinsic, value, meaning, that, an, act, is, right, if, and, only, if, it, or, the, rule, under, which, it, falls, produces, will, probably, produce, or, is, intended, to, produce, a, greater, balance, of, good, over, evil, than, any, alternative, act, this, concept, is, exemplified, by, the, famous, aphorism, the, end, justifies, the, means, variously, attributed, to, machiavelli, or, ovid, i, e, if, a, goal, is, morally, important, enough, any, method, of, achieving, it, is, acceptable, teleological, ethical, theories, are, contrasted, with, deontological, ethical, theories, which, hold, that, acts, themselves, are, inherently, good, or, bad, rather, than, good, or, bad, because, of, extrinsic, factors, such, as, the, act, s, consequences, or, the, moral, character, of, the, person, who, acts, nature, has, placed, mankind, under, the, governance, of, two, sovereign, masters, pain, and, pleasure, it, is, for, them, alone, to, point, out, what, we, ought, to, do, as, well, as, to, determine, what, we, shall, do, on, the, one, hand, the, standard, of, right, and, wrong, on, the, other, the, chain, of, causes, and, effects, are, fastened, to, their, throne, they, govern, us, in, all, we, do, in, all, we, say, in, all, we, think, in, summary, jeremy, bentham, states, that, people, are, driven, by, their, interests, and, their, fears, but, their, interests, take, precedence, over, their, fears, their, interests, are, carried, out, in, accordance, with, how, people, view, the, consequences, that, might, be, involved, with, their, interests, happiness, in, this, account, is, defined, as, the, maximization, of, pleasure, and, the, minimization, of, pain, it, can, be, argued, that, the, existence, of, phenomenal, consciousness, and, qualia, is, required, for, the, experience, of, pleasure, or, pain, to, have, an, ethical, significance, historically, hedonistic, utilitarianism, is, the, paradigmatic, example, of, a, consequentialist, moral, theory, this, form, of, utilitarianism, holds, that, what, matters, is, the, aggregate, happiness, the, happiness, of, everyone, and, not, the, happiness, of, any, particular, person, john, stuart, mill, in, his, exposition, of, hedonistic, utilitarianism, proposed, a, hierarchy, of, pleasures, meaning, that, the, pursuit, of, certain, kinds, of, pleasure, is, more, highly, valued, than, the, pursuit, of, other, pleasures, however, some, contemporary, utilitarians, such, as, peter, singer, are, concerned, with, maximizing, the, satisfaction, of, preferences, hence, preference, utilitarianism, other, contemporary, forms, of, utilitarianism, mirror, the, forms, of, consequentialism, outlined, below, in, general, consequentialist, theories, focus, on, actions, however, this, need, not, be, the, case, rule, consequentialism, is, a, theory, that, is, sometimes, seen, as, an, attempt, to, reconcile, consequentialism, with, deontology, or, rules, based, ethics, and, in, some, cases, this, is, stated, as, a, criticism, of, rule, consequentialism, like, deontology, rule, consequentialism, holds, that, moral, behavior, involves, following, certain, rules, however, rule, consequentialism, chooses, rules, based, on, the, consequences, that, the, selection, of, those, rules, has, rule, consequentialism, exists, in, the, forms, of, rule, utilitarianism, and, rule, egoism, various, theorists, are, split, as, to, whether, the, rules, are, the, only, determinant, of, moral, behavior, or, not, for, example, robert, nozick, held, that, a, certain, set, of, minimal, rules, which, he, calls, side, constraints, are, necessary, to, ensure, appropriate, actions, there, are, also, differences, as, to, how, absolute, these, moral, rules, are, thus, while, nozick, s, side, constraints, are, absolute, restrictions, on, behavior, amartya, sen, proposes, a, theory, that, recognizes, the, importance, of, certain, rules, but, these, rules, are, not, absolute, that, is, they, may, be, violated, if, strict, adherence, to, the, rule, would, lead, to, much, more, undesirable, consequences, one, of, the, most, common, objections, to, rule, consequentialism, is, that, it, is, incoherent, because, it, is, based, on, the, consequentialist, principle, that, what, we, should, be, concerned, with, is, maximizing, the, good, but, then, it, tells, us, not, to, act, to, maximize, the, good, but, to, follow, rules, even, in, cases, where, we, know, that, breaking, the, rule, could, produce, better, results, in, ideal, code, real, world, brad, hooker, avoids, this, objection, by, not, basing, his, form, of, rule, consequentialism, on, the, ideal, of, maximizing, the, good, he, writes, he, best, argument, for, rule, consequentialism, is, not, that, it, derives, from, an, overarching, commitment, to, maximise, the, good, the, best, argument, for, rule, consequentialism, is, that, it, does, a, better, job, than, its, rivals, of, matching, and, tying, together, our, moral, convictions, as, well, as, offering, us, help, with, our, moral, disagreements, and, uncertainties, derek, parfit, described, hooker, s, book, as, the, best, statement, and, defence, so, far, of, one, of, the, most, important, moral, theories, it, is, the, business, of, the, benevolent, man, to, seek, to, promote, what, is, beneficial, to, the, world, and, to, eliminate, what, is, harmful, and, to, provide, a, model, for, the, world, what, benefits, he, will, carry, out, what, does, not, benefit, men, he, will, leave, alone, chinese, state, consequentialism, also, known, as, mohist, consequentialism, is, an, ethical, theory, that, evaluates, the, moral, worth, of, an, action, based, on, how, much, it, contributes, to, the, welfare, of, a, state, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, mohist, consequentialism, dating, back, to, the, 5th, century, bce, is, the, world, s, earliest, form, of, consequentialism, a, remarkably, sophisticated, version, based, on, a, plurality, of, intrinsic, goods, taken, as, constitutive, of, human, welfare, unlike, utilitarianism, which, views, utility, as, the, sole, moral, good, the, basic, goods, in, mohist, consequentialist, thinking, are, order, material, wealth, and, increase, in, population, the, word, order, refers, to, mozi, s, stance, against, warfare, and, violence, which, he, viewed, as, pointless, and, a, threat, to, social, stability, material, wealth, of, mohist, consequentialism, refers, to, basic, needs, like, shelter, and, clothing, and, increase, in, population, relates, to, the, time, of, mozi, war, and, famine, were, common, and, population, growth, was, seen, as, a, moral, necessity, for, a, harmonious, society, in, the, cambridge, history, of, ancient, china, stanford, sinologist, david, shepherd, nivison, writes, that, the, moral, goods, of, mohism, are, interrelated, more, basic, wealth, then, more, reproduction, more, people, then, more, production, and, wealth, if, people, have, plenty, they, would, be, good, filial, kind, and, so, on, unproblematically, the, mohists, believed, that, morality, is, based, on, promoting, the, benefit, of, all, under, heaven, and, eliminating, harm, to, all, under, heaven, in, contrast, to, jeremy, bentham, s, views, state, consequentialism, is, not, utilitarian, because, it, is, not, hedonistic, or, individualistic, the, importance, of, outcomes, that, are, good, for, the, community, outweigh, the, importance, of, individual, pleasure, and, pain, the, term, state, consequentialism, has, also, been, applied, to, the, political, philosophy, of, the, confucian, philosopher, xunzi, on, the, other, hand, legalist, han, fei, is, motivated, almost, totally, from, the, ruler, s, point, of, view, ethical, egoism, can, be, understood, as, a, consequentialist, theory, according, to, which, the, consequences, for, the, individual, agent, are, taken, to, matter, more, than, any, other, result, thus, egoism, will, prescribe, actions, that, may, be, beneficial, detrimental, or, neutral, to, the, welfare, of, others, some, like, henry, sidgwick, argue, that, a, certain, degree, of, egoism, promotes, the, general, welfare, of, society, for, two, reasons, because, individuals, know, how, to, please, themselves, best, and, because, if, everyone, were, an, austere, altruist, then, general, welfare, would, inevitably, decrease, ethical, altruism, can, be, seen, as, a, consequentialist, theory, which, prescribes, that, an, individual, take, actions, that, have, the, best, consequences, for, everyone, not, necessarily, including, themselves, similar, to, selflessness, this, was, advocated, by, auguste, comte, who, coined, the, term, altruism, and, whose, ethics, can, be, summed, up, in, the, phrase, live, for, others, the, two, level, approach, involves, engaging, in, critical, reasoning, and, considering, all, the, possible, ramifications, of, one, s, actions, before, making, an, ethical, decision, but, reverting, to, generally, reliable, moral, rules, when, one, is, not, in, a, position, to, stand, back, and, examine, the, dilemma, as, a, whole, in, practice, this, equates, to, adhering, to, rule, consequentialism, when, one, can, only, reason, on, an, intuitive, level, and, to, act, consequentialism, when, in, a, position, to, stand, back, and, reason, on, a, more, critical, level, this, position, can, be, described, as, a, reconciliation, between, act, consequentialism, in, which, the, morality, of, an, action, is, determined, by, that, action, s, effects, and, rule, consequentialism, in, which, moral, behavior, is, derived, from, following, rules, that, lead, to, positive, outcomes, the, two, level, approach, to, consequentialism, is, most, often, associated, with, r, m, hare, and, peter, singer, another, consequentialist, application, view, is, motive, consequentialism, which, looks, at, whether, the, state, of, affairs, that, results, from, the, motive, to, choose, an, action, is, better, or, at, least, as, good, as, each, alternative, state, of, affairs, that, would, have, resulted, from, alternative, actions, this, version, gives, relevance, to, the, motive, of, an, act, and, links, it, to, its, consequences, an, act, can, therefore, not, be, wrong, if, the, decision, to, act, was, based, on, a, right, motive, a, possible, inference, is, that, one, can, not, be, blamed, for, mistaken, judgments, if, the, motivation, was, to, do, good, most, consequentialist, theories, focus, on, promoting, some, sort, of, good, consequences, however, negative, utilitarianism, lays, out, a, consequentialist, theory, that, focuses, solely, on, minimizing, bad, consequences, one, major, difference, between, these, two, approaches, is, the, agent, s, responsibility, positive, consequentialism, demands, that, we, bring, about, good, states, of, affairs, whereas, negative, consequentialism, requires, that, we, avoid, bad, ones, stronger, versions, of, negative, consequentialism, will, require, active, intervention, to, prevent, bad, and, ameliorate, existing, harm, in, weaker, versions, simple, forbearance, from, acts, tending, to, harm, others, is, sufficient, an, example, of, this, is, the, slippery, slope, argument, which, encourages, others, to, avoid, a, specified, act, on, the, grounds, that, it, may, ultimately, lead, to, undesirable, consequences, often, negative, consequentialist, theories, assert, that, reducing, suffering, is, more, important, than, increasing, pleasure, karl, popper, for, example, claimed, that, from, the, moral, point, of, view, pain, cannot, be, outweighed, by, pleasure, while, popper, is, not, a, consequentialist, per, se, this, is, taken, as, a, classic, statement, of, negative, utilitarianism, when, considering, a, theory, of, justice, negative, consequentialists, may, use, a, statewide, or, global, reaching, principle, the, reduction, of, suffering, for, the, disadvantaged, is, more, valuable, than, increased, pleasure, for, the, affluent, or, luxurious, since, pure, consequentialism, holds, that, an, action, is, to, be, judged, solely, by, its, result, most, consequentialist, theories, hold, that, a, deliberate, action, is, no, different, from, a, deliberate, decision, not, to, act, this, contrasts, with, the, acts, and, omissions, doctrine, which, is, upheld, by, some, medical, ethicists, and, some, religions, it, asserts, there, is, a, significant, moral, distinction, between, acts, and, deliberate, non, actions, which, lead, to, the, same, outcome, this, contrast, is, brought, out, in, issues, such, as, voluntary, euthanasia, the, normative, status, of, an, action, depends, on, its, consequences, according, to, consequentialism, the, consequences, of, the, actions, of, an, agent, may, include, other, actions, by, this, agent, actualism, and, possibilism, disagree, on, how, later, possible, actions, impact, the, normative, status, of, the, current, action, by, the, same, agent, actualists, assert, that, it, is, only, relevant, what, the, agent, would, actually, do, later, for, assessing, the, value, of, an, alternative, possibilists, on, the, other, hand, hold, that, we, should, also, take, into, account, what, the, agent, could, do, even, if, she, would, not, do, it, for, example, assume, that, gifre, has, the, choice, between, two, alternatives, eating, a, cookie, or, not, eating, anything, having, eaten, the, first, cookie, gifre, could, stop, eating, cookies, which, is, the, best, alternative, but, after, having, tasted, one, cookie, gifre, would, freely, decide, to, continue, eating, cookies, until, the, whole, bag, is, finished, which, would, result, in, a, terrible, stomach, ache, and, would, be, the, worst, alternative, not, eating, any, cookies, at, all, on, the, other, hand, would, be, the, second, best, alternative, now, the, question, is, should, gifre, eat, the, first, cookie, or, not, actualists, are, only, concerned, with, the, actual, consequences, according, to, them, gifre, should, not, eat, any, cookies, at, all, since, it, is, better, than, the, alternative, leading, to, a, stomach, ache, possibilists, however, contend, that, the, best, possible, course, of, action, involves, eating, the, first, cookie, and, this, is, therefore, what, gifre, should, do, one, counterintuitive, consequence, of, actualism, is, that, agents, can, avoid, moral, obligations, simply, by, having, an, imperfect, moral, character, for, example, a, lazy, person, might, justify, rejecting, a, request, to, help, a, friend, by, arguing, that, due, to, her, lazy, character, she, would, not, have, done, the, work, anyway, even, if, she, had, accepted, the, request, by, rejecting, the, offer, right, away, she, managed, at, least, not, to, waste, anyone, s, time, actualists, might, even, consider, her, behavior, praiseworthy, since, she, did, what, according, to, actualism, she, ought, to, have, done, this, seems, to, be, a, very, easy, way, to, get, off, the, hook, that, is, avoided, by, possibilism, but, possibilism, has, to, face, the, objection, that, in, some, cases, it, sanctions, and, even, recommends, what, actually, leads, to, the, worst, outcome, douglas, w, portmore, has, suggested, that, these, and, other, problems, of, actualism, and, possibilism, can, be, avoided, by, constraining, what, counts, as, a, genuine, alternative, for, the, agent, on, his, view, it, is, a, requirement, that, the, agent, has, rational, control, over, the, event, in, question, for, example, eating, only, one, cookie, and, stopping, afterward, only, is, an, option, for, gifre, if, she, has, the, rational, capacity, to, repress, her, temptation, to, continue, eating, if, the, temptation, is, irrepressible, then, this, course, of, action, is, not, considered, to, be, an, option, and, is, therefore, not, relevant, when, assessing, what, the, best, alternative, is, portmore, suggests, that, given, this, adjustment, we, should, prefer, a, view, very, closely, associated, with, possibilism, called, maximalism, one, important, characteristic, of, many, normative, moral, theories, such, as, consequentialism, is, the, ability, to, produce, practical, moral, judgements, at, the, very, least, any, moral, theory, needs, to, define, the, standpoint, from, which, the, goodness, of, the, consequences, are, to, be, determined, what, is, primarily, at, stake, here, is, the, responsibility, of, the, agent, one, common, tactic, among, consequentialists, particularly, those, committed, to, an, altruistic, selfless, account, of, consequentialism, is, to, employ, an, ideal, neutral, observer, from, which, moral, judgements, can, be, made, john, rawls, a, critic, of, utilitarianism, argues, that, utilitarianism, in, common, with, other, forms, of, consequentialism, relies, on, the, perspective, of, such, an, ideal, observer, the, particular, characteristics, of, this, ideal, observer, can, vary, from, an, omniscient, observer, who, would, grasp, all, the, consequences, of, any, action, to, an, ideally, informed, observer, who, knows, as, much, as, could, reasonably, be, expected, but, not, necessarily, all, the, circumstances, or, all, the, possible, consequences, consequentialist, theories, that, adopt, this, paradigm, hold, that, right, action, is, the, action, that, will, bring, about, the, best, consequences, from, this, ideal, observer, s, perspective, in, practice, it, is, very, difficult, and, at, times, arguably, impossible, to, adopt, the, point, of, view, of, an, ideal, observer, individual, moral, agents, do, not, know, everything, about, their, particular, situations, and, thus, do, not, know, all, the, possible, consequences, of, their, potential, actions, for, this, reason, some, theorists, have, argued, that, consequentialist, theories, can, only, require, agents, to, choose, the, best, action, in, line, with, what, they, know, about, the, situation, however, if, this, approach, is, na, vely, adopted, then, moral, agents, who, for, example, recklessly, fail, to, reflect, on, their, situation, and, act, in, a, way, that, brings, about, terrible, results, could, be, said, to, be, acting, in, a, morally, justifiable, way, acting, in, a, situation, without, first, informing, oneself, of, the, circumstances, of, the, situation, can, lead, to, even, the, most, well, intended, actions, yielding, miserable, consequences, as, a, result, it, could, be, argued, that, there, is, a, moral, imperative, for, agents, to, inform, themselves, as, much, as, possible, about, a, situation, before, judging, the, appropriate, course, of, action, this, imperative, of, course, is, derived, from, consequential, thinking, a, better, informed, agent, is, able, to, bring, about, better, consequences, moral, action, always, has, consequences, for, certain, people, or, things, varieties, of, consequentialism, can, be, differentiated, by, the, beneficiary, of, the, good, consequences, that, is, one, might, ask, consequences, for, whom, a, fundamental, distinction, can, be, drawn, between, theories, which, require, that, agents, act, for, ends, perhaps, disconnected, from, their, own, interests, and, drives, and, theories, which, permit, that, agents, act, for, ends, in, which, they, have, some, personal, interest, or, motivation, these, are, called, agent, neutral, and, agent, focused, theories, respectively, agent, neutral, consequentialism, ignores, the, specific, value, a, state, of, affairs, has, for, any, particular, agent, thus, in, an, agent, neutral, theory, an, actor, s, personal, goals, do, not, count, any, more, than, anyone, else, s, goals, in, evaluating, what, action, the, actor, should, take, agent, focused, consequentialism, on, the, other, hand, focuses, on, the, particular, needs, of, the, moral, agent, thus, in, an, agent, focused, account, such, as, one, that, peter, railton, outlines, the, agent, might, be, concerned, with, the, general, welfare, but, the, agent, is, more, concerned, with, the, immediate, welfare, of, herself, and, her, friends, and, family, these, two, approaches, could, be, reconciled, by, acknowledging, the, tension, between, an, agent, s, interests, as, an, individual, and, as, a, member, of, various, groups, and, seeking, to, somehow, optimize, among, all, of, these, interests, for, example, it, may, be, meaningful, to, speak, of, an, action, as, being, good, for, someone, as, an, individual, but, bad, for, them, as, a, citizen, of, their, town, many, consequentialist, theories, may, seem, primarily, concerned, with, human, beings, and, their, relationships, with, other, human, beings, however, some, philosophers, argue, that, we, should, not, limit, our, ethical, consideration, to, the, interests, of, human, beings, alone, jeremy, bentham, who, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, utilitarianism, argues, that, animals, can, experience, pleasure, and, pain, thus, demanding, that, non, human, animals, should, be, a, serious, object, of, moral, concern, more, recently, peter, singer, has, argued, that, it, is, unreasonable, that, we, do, not, give, equal, consideration, to, the, interests, of, animals, as, to, those, of, human, beings, when, we, choose, the, way, we, are, to, treat, them, such, equal, consideration, does, not, necessarily, imply, identical, treatment, of, humans, and, non, humans, any, more, than, it, necessarily, implies, identical, treatment, of, all, humans, one, way, to, divide, various, consequentialisms, is, by, the, types, of, consequences, that, are, taken, to, matter, most, that, is, which, consequences, count, as, good, states, of, affairs, according, to, utilitarianism, a, good, action, is, one, that, results, in, an, increase, in, pleasure, and, the, best, action, is, one, that, results, in, the, most, pleasure, for, the, greatest, number, closely, related, is, eudaimonic, consequentialism, according, to, which, a, full, flourishing, life, which, may, or, may, not, be, the, same, as, enjoying, a, great, deal, of, pleasure, is, the, ultimate, aim, similarly, one, might, adopt, an, aesthetic, consequentialism, in, which, the, ultimate, aim, is, to, produce, beauty, however, one, might, fix, on, non, psychological, goods, as, the, relevant, effect, thus, one, might, pursue, an, increase, in, material, equality, or, political, liberty, instead, of, something, like, the, more, ephemeral, pleasure, other, theories, adopt, a, package, of, several, goods, all, to, be, promoted, equally, as, the, consequentialist, approach, contains, an, inherent, assumption, that, the, outcomes, of, a, moral, decision, can, be, quantified, in, terms, of, goodness, or, badness, or, at, least, put, in, order, of, increasing, preference, it, is, an, especially, suited, moral, theory, for, a, probabilistic, and, decision, theoretical, approach, consequentialism, can, also, be, contrasted, with, aretaic, moral, theories, such, as, virtue, ethics, whereas, consequentialist, theories, posit, that, consequences, of, action, should, be, the, primary, focus, of, our, thinking, about, ethics, virtue, ethics, insists, that, it, is, the, character, rather, than, the, consequences, of, actions, that, should, be, the, focal, point, some, virtue, ethicists, hold, that, consequentialist, theories, totally, disregard, the, development, and, importance, of, moral, character, for, example, philippa, foot, argues, that, consequences, in, themselves, have, no, ethical, content, unless, it, has, been, provided, by, a, virtue, such, as, benevolence, however, consequentialism, and, virtue, ethics, need, not, be, entirely, antagonistic, iain, king, has, developed, an, approach, that, reconciles, the, two, schools, other, consequentialists, consider, effects, on, the, character, of, people, involved, in, an, action, when, assessing, consequence, similarly, a, consequentialist, theory, may, aim, at, the, maximization, of, a, particular, virtue, or, set, of, virtues, finally, following, foot, s, lead, one, might, adopt, a, sort, of, consequentialism, that, argues, that, virtuous, activity, ultimately, produces, the, best, consequences, the, ultimate, end, is, a, concept, in, the, moral, philosophy, of, max, weber, in, which, individuals, act, in, a, faithful, rather, than, rational, manner, we, must, be, clear, about, the, fact, that, all, ethically, oriented, conduct, may, be, guided, by, one, of, two, fundamentally, differing, and, irreconcilably, opposed, maxims, conduct, can, be, oriented, to, an, ethic, of, ultimate, ends, or, to, an, ethic, of, responsibility, there, is, an, abysmal, contrast, between, conduct, that, follows, the, maxim, of, an, ethic, of, ultimate, ends, that, is, in, religious, terms, the, christian, does, rightly, and, leaves, the, results, with, the, lord, and, conduct, that, follows, the, maxim, of, an, ethic, of, responsibility, in, which, case, one, has, to, give, an, account, of, the, foreseeable, results, of, one, s, action, g, e, m, anscombe, objects, to, the, consequentialism, of, sidgwick, on, the, grounds, that, the, moral, worth, of, an, action, is, premised, on, the, predictive, capabilities, of, the, individual, relieving, them, of, the, responsibility, for, the, badness, of, an, act, should, they, make, out, a, case, for, not, having, foreseen, negative, consequences, immanuel, kant, makes, a, similar, argument, against, consequentialism, in, the, case, of, the, inquiring, murder, the, example, asks, whether, or, not, it, would, be, right, to, give, false, statement, to, an, inquiring, murderer, in, order, to, misdirect, the, individual, away, from, the, intended, victim, he, argues, in, on, a, supposed, right, to, tell, lies, from, benevolent, motives, that, lying, from, benevolent, motives, here, the, motive, to, maximize, the, good, consequences, by, protecting, the, intended, victim, should, then, make, the, liar, responsible, for, the, consequences, of, the, act, for, example, it, could, be, that, by, misdirecting, the, inquiring, murder, away, from, where, one, thought, the, intended, victim, was, actually, directed, the, murder, to, the, intended, victim, that, such, an, act, is, immoral, mirrors, anscombe, s, objection, to, sidgwick, that, his, consequentialism, would, problematically, absolve, the, consequentalist, of, moral, responsibility, when, the, consequentalist, fails, to, foresee, the, true, consequences, of, an, act, the, future, amplification, of, the, effects, of, small, decisions, is, an, important, factor, that, makes, it, more, difficult, to, predict, the, ethical, value, of, consequences, even, though, most, would, agree, that, only, predictable, consequences, are, charged, with, a, moral, responsibility, bernard, williams, has, argued, that, consequentialism, is, alienating, because, it, requires, moral, agents, to, put, too, much, distance, between, themselves, and, their, own, projects, and, commitments, williams, argues, that, consequentialism, requires, moral, agents, to, take, a, strictly, impersonal, view, of, all, actions, since, it, is, only, the, consequences, and, not, who, produces, them, that, are, said, to, matter, williams, argues, that, this, demands, too, much, of, moral, agents, since, he, claims, consequentialism, demands, that, they, be, willing, to, sacrifice, any, and, all, personal, projects, and, commitments, in, any, given, circumstance, in, order, to, pursue, the, most, beneficent, course, of, action, possible, he, argues, further, that, consequentialism, fails, to, make, sense, of, intuitions, that, it, can, matter, whether, or, not, someone, is, personally, the, author, of, a, particular, consequence, for, example, that, participating, in, a, crime, can, matter, even, if, the, crime, would, have, been, committed, anyway, or, would, even, have, been, worse, without, the, agent, s, participation, some, consequentialists, most, notably, peter, railton, have, attempted, to, develop, a, form, of, consequentialism, that, acknowledges, and, avoids, the, objections, raised, by, williams, railton, argues, that, williams, s, criticisms, can, be, avoided, by, adopting, a, form, of, consequentialism, in, which, moral, decisions, are, to, be, determined, by, the, sort, of, life, that, they, express, on, his, account, the, agent, should, choose, the, sort, of, life, that, will, on, the, whole, produce, the, best, overall, effects
