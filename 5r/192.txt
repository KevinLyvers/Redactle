brad, warner, states, that, in, buddhism, there, is, no, concept, of, sin, at, all, the, buddha, dharma, education, association, also, expressly, states, the, idea, of, sin, or, original, sin, has, no, place, in, buddhism, ethnologist, christoph, von, f, rer, haimendorf, explained, in, buddhist, thinking, the, whole, universe, men, as, well, as, gods, are, subject, to, a, reign, of, law, every, action, good, or, bad, has, an, inevitable, and, automatic, effect, in, a, long, chain, of, causes, an, effect, that, is, independent, of, the, will, of, any, deity, even, though, this, may, leave, no, room, for, the, concept, of, sin, in, the, sense, of, an, act, of, defiance, against, the, authority, of, a, personal, god, buddhists, speak, of, sin, when, referring, to, transgressions, against, the, universal, moral, code, however, there, are, five, heinous, crimes, in, buddhism, that, bring, immediate, disaster, through, karmic, process, these, five, crimes, are, collectively, referred, to, as, anantarika, karma, in, theravada, buddhism, and, pa, c, nantarya, p, li, in, the, mahayana, sutra, preached, by, the, buddha, on, the, total, extinction, of, the, dharma, the, five, crimes, or, sins, are, the, doctrine, of, sin, is, central, to, christianity, since, its, basic, message, is, about, redemption, in, christ, christian, hamartiology, describes, sin, as, an, act, of, offense, against, god, by, despising, his, persons, and, christian, biblical, law, and, by, injuring, others, in, christian, views, it, is, an, evil, human, act, which, violates, the, rational, nature, of, man, as, well, as, god, s, nature, and, his, eternal, law, according, to, the, classical, definition, of, st, augustine, of, hippo, sin, is, a, word, deed, or, desire, in, opposition, to, the, eternal, law, of, god, thus, sin, requires, redemption, a, metaphor, alluding, to, atonement, in, which, the, death, of, jesus, is, the, price, that, is, paid, to, release, the, faithful, from, the, bondage, of, sin, in, some, forms, of, christianity, it, also, requires, reparation, see, penance, among, some, scholars, sin, is, understood, mostly, as, a, legal, infraction, or, contract, violation, of, non, binding, philosophical, frameworks, and, perspectives, of, christian, ethics, and, so, salvation, tends, to, be, viewed, in, legal, terms, other, christian, scholars, understand, sin, to, be, fundamentally, relational, a, loss, of, love, for, the, christian, god, and, an, elevation, of, self, love, concupiscence, in, this, sense, as, was, later, propounded, by, augustine, in, his, debate, with, the, pelagians, as, with, the, legal, definition, of, sin, this, definition, also, affects, the, understanding, of, christian, grace, and, salvation, which, are, thus, viewed, in, relational, terms, this, condition, has, been, characterized, in, many, ways, ranging, from, something, as, insignificant, as, the, tendency, toward, sin, referred, to, as, a, sin, nature, to, something, as, drastic, as, total, depravity, the, teaching, that, humans, apart, from, god, s, grace, are, incapable, of, choosing, to, do, good, the, concept, of, original, sin, was, first, alluded, to, in, the, 2nd, century, by, irenaeus, bishop, of, lyon, in, his, controversy, with, certain, dualist, gnostics, other, church, fathers, such, as, augustine, also, shaped, and, developed, the, doctrine, seeing, it, as, based, on, the, new, testament, teaching, of, paul, the, apostle, romans, 5, 12, 21, and, 1, corinthians, 15, 21, 22, and, the, old, testament, verse, of, psalms, 51, 5, tertullian, cyprian, ambrose, and, ambrosiaster, considered, that, humanity, shares, in, adam, s, sin, transmitted, by, human, generation, augustine, s, formulation, of, original, sin, after, 412, ce, was, popular, among, protestant, reformers, such, as, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, who, equated, original, sin, with, concupiscence, or, hurtful, desire, affirming, that, it, persisted, even, after, baptism, and, completely, destroyed, freedom, to, do, good, before, 412, ce, augustine, said, that, free, will, was, weakened, but, not, destroyed, by, original, sin, but, after, 412, ce, this, changed, to, a, loss, of, free, will, except, to, sin, modern, augustinian, calvinism, holds, this, later, view, the, jansenist, movement, which, the, catholic, church, declared, to, be, heretical, also, maintained, that, original, sin, destroyed, freedom, of, will, instead, the, catholic, church, declares, that, baptism, erases, original, sin, methodist, theology, teaches, that, original, sin, is, eradicted, through, entire, sanctification, sin, khi, is, an, important, concept, in, islamic, ethics, muslims, see, sin, as, anything, that, goes, against, the, commands, of, god, allah, a, breach, of, the, laws, and, norms, laid, down, by, religion, islam, teaches, that, sin, is, an, act, and, not, a, state, of, being, it, is, believed, that, god, weighs, an, individual, s, good, deeds, against, his, or, her, sins, on, the, day, of, judgement, and, punishes, those, individuals, whose, evil, deeds, outweigh, their, good, deeds, these, individuals, are, thought, to, be, sentenced, to, an, afterlife, in, the, fires, of, jahannam, hell, islamic, terms, for, sin, include, dhanb, and, kha, a, which, are, synonymous, and, refer, to, intentional, sins, khi, which, means, simply, a, sin, and, ithm, which, is, used, for, grave, sins, judaism, regards, the, violation, of, any, of, the, 613, commandments, as, a, sin, judaism, teaches, that, sin, is, a, part, of, life, since, there, is, no, perfect, man, and, everyone, has, an, inclination, to, do, evil, sin, has, many, classifications, and, degrees, but, the, principal, classification, is, that, of, missing, the, mark, cheit, in, hebrew, some, sins, are, punishable, with, death, by, the, court, others, with, death, by, heaven, others, with, lashes, and, others, without, such, punishment, but, no, sins, committed, with, willful, intentions, go, without, consequence, sins, committed, out, of, lack, of, knowledge, are, not, considered, sins, since, sin, cannot, be, a, sin, if, the, one, who, committed, it, did, not, know, it, was, wrong, unintentional, sins, are, considered, less, severe, sins, sins, between, people, are, considered, much, more, serious, in, judaism, than, sins, between, man, and, god, yom, kippur, the, main, day, of, repentance, in, judaism, can, atone, for, sins, between, man, and, god, but, not, for, sins, between, man, and, his, fellow, that, is, until, he, has, appeased, his, friend, eleazar, ben, azariah, derived, from, all, your, sins, before, god, you, shall, be, cleansed, book, of, leviticus, 16, 30, for, sins, between, man, and, god, yom, kippur, atones, but, for, sins, between, man, and, his, fellow, yom, kippur, does, not, atone, until, he, appeases, his, fellow, when, the, temple, yet, stood, in, jerusalem, people, would, offer, korbanot, sacrifices, for, their, misdeeds, the, atoning, aspect, of, korbanot, is, carefully, circumscribed, for, the, most, part, korbanot, only, expiates, unintentional, sins, that, is, sins, committed, because, a, person, forgot, that, this, thing, was, a, sin, or, by, mistake, no, atonement, is, needed, for, violations, committed, under, duress, or, through, lack, of, knowledge, and, for, the, most, part, korbanot, cannot, atone, for, a, malicious, deliberate, sin, in, addition, korbanot, have, no, expiating, effect, unless, the, person, making, the, offering, sincerely, repents, of, his, or, her, actions, before, making, the, offering, and, makes, restitution, to, any, person, who, was, harmed, by, the, violation, judaism, teaches, that, all, willful, sin, has, consequences, the, completely, righteous, suffer, for, their, sins, by, humiliation, poverty, and, suffering, that, god, sends, them, in, this, world, and, receive, their, reward, in, the, world, to, come, the, in, between, not, completely, righteous, or, completely, wicked, suffer, for, and, repent, their, sins, after, death, and, thereafter, join, the, righteous, the, very, evil, do, not, repent, even, at, the, gates, of, hell, such, people, prosper, in, this, world, to, receive, their, reward, for, any, good, deed, but, cannot, be, cleansed, by, and, hence, cannot, leave, gehinnom, because, they, do, not, or, cannot, repent, this, world, can, therefore, seem, unjust, where, the, righteous, suffer, while, the, wicked, prosper, many, great, thinkers, have, contemplated, this, the, shinto, concept, of, sin, is, inexorably, linked, to, concepts, of, purity, and, pollution, shinto, does, not, have, a, concept, of, original, sin, and, instead, believes, that, all, human, beings, are, born, pure, sin, also, called, tsumi, is, anything, that, makes, people, impure, i, e, anything, that, separates, them, from, the, kami, however, shinto, does, not, believe, this, impurity, is, the, result, of, human, actions, but, rather, the, result, of, evil, spirits, or, other, external, factors, sin, can, have, a, variety, of, consequences, in, japan, including, disaster, and, disease, therefore, purification, rituals, or, harae, are, viewed, as, important, not, just, to, the, spiritual, and, physical, health, of, the, individual, but, also, to, the, well, being, of, the, nation
