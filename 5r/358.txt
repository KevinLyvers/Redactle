meroitic, wos, or, wusa, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, k, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, isis, was, a, major, goddess, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, whose, worship, spread, throughout, the, greco, roman, world, isis, was, first, mentioned, in, the, old, kingdom, c, 2686, c, 2181, bce, as, one, of, the, main, characters, of, the, osiris, myth, in, which, she, resurrects, her, slain, brother, and, husband, the, divine, king, osiris, and, produces, and, protects, his, heir, horus, she, was, believed, to, help, the, dead, enter, the, afterlife, as, she, had, helped, osiris, and, she, was, considered, the, divine, mother, of, the, pharaoh, who, was, likened, to, horus, her, maternal, aid, was, invoked, in, healing, spells, to, benefit, ordinary, people, originally, she, played, a, limited, role, in, royal, rituals, and, temple, rites, although, she, was, more, prominent, in, funerary, practices, and, magical, texts, she, was, usually, portrayed, in, art, as, a, human, woman, wearing, a, throne, like, hieroglyph, on, her, head, during, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, c, 1070, bce, as, she, took, on, traits, that, originally, belonged, to, hathor, the, preeminent, goddess, of, earlier, times, isis, was, portrayed, wearing, hathor, s, headdress, a, sun, disk, between, the, horns, of, a, cow, in, the, first, millennium, bce, osiris, and, isis, became, the, most, widely, worshipped, egyptian, deities, and, isis, absorbed, traits, from, many, other, goddesses, rulers, in, egypt, and, its, southern, neighbor, nubia, built, temples, dedicated, primarily, to, isis, and, her, temple, at, philae, was, a, religious, center, for, egyptians, and, nubians, alike, her, reputed, magical, power, was, greater, than, that, of, all, other, gods, and, she, was, said, to, govern, the, natural, world, and, wield, power, over, fate, itself, in, the, hellenistic, period, 323, 30, bce, when, egypt, was, ruled, and, settled, by, greeks, isis, was, worshipped, by, greeks, and, egyptians, along, with, a, new, god, serapis, their, worship, diffused, into, the, wider, mediterranean, world, isis, s, greek, devotees, ascribed, to, her, traits, taken, from, greek, deities, such, as, the, invention, of, marriage, and, the, protection, of, ships, at, sea, as, hellenistic, culture, was, absorbed, by, rome, in, the, first, century, bce, the, cult, of, isis, became, a, part, of, roman, religion, her, devotees, were, a, small, proportion, of, the, roman, empire, s, population, but, were, found, all, across, its, territory, her, following, developed, distinctive, festivals, such, as, the, navigium, isidis, as, well, as, initiation, ceremonies, resembling, those, of, other, greco, roman, mystery, cults, some, of, her, devotees, said, she, encompassed, all, feminine, divine, powers, in, the, world, the, worship, of, isis, was, ended, by, the, rise, of, christianity, in, the, fourth, through, sixth, centuries, ce, her, worship, may, have, influenced, christian, beliefs, and, practices, such, as, the, veneration, of, mary, but, the, evidence, for, this, influence, is, ambiguous, and, often, controversial, isis, continues, to, appear, in, western, culture, particularly, in, esotericism, and, modern, paganism, often, as, a, personification, of, nature, or, the, feminine, aspect, of, divinity, whereas, some, egyptian, deities, appeared, in, the, late, predynastic, period, before, c, 3100, bce, neither, isis, nor, her, husband, osiris, were, mentioned, by, name, before, the, fifth, dynasty, c, 2494, 2345, bce, an, inscription, that, may, refer, to, isis, dates, to, the, reign, of, nyuserre, ini, during, that, period, and, she, appears, prominently, in, the, pyramid, texts, which, began, to, be, written, down, at, the, end, of, the, dynasty, and, whose, content, may, have, developed, much, earlier, several, passages, in, the, pyramid, texts, link, isis, with, the, region, of, the, nile, delta, near, behbeit, el, hagar, and, sebennytos, and, her, cult, may, have, originated, there, many, scholars, have, focused, on, isis, s, name, in, trying, to, determine, her, origins, her, egyptian, name, was, written, as, st, the, pronunciation, of, which, changed, over, time, r, sat, r, sa, sa, s, which, became, se, in, the, coptic, form, of, egyptian, wusa, in, the, meroitic, language, of, nubia, and, on, which, her, modern, name, is, based, in, greek, the, hieroglyphic, writing, of, her, name, incorporates, the, sign, for, a, throne, which, isis, also, wears, on, her, head, as, a, sign, of, her, identity, the, symbol, serves, as, a, phonogram, spelling, the, st, sounds, in, her, name, but, it, may, have, also, represented, a, link, with, actual, thrones, the, egyptian, term, for, a, throne, was, also, st, and, may, have, shared, a, common, etymology, with, isis, s, name, therefore, the, egyptologist, kurt, sethe, suggested, she, was, originally, a, personification, of, thrones, henri, frankfort, agreed, believing, that, the, throne, was, considered, the, king, s, mother, and, thus, a, goddess, because, of, its, power, to, make, a, man, into, a, king, other, scholars, such, as, j, rgen, osing, and, klaus, p, kuhlmann, have, disputed, this, interpretation, because, of, dissimilarities, between, isis, s, name, and, the, word, for, a, throne, or, a, lack, of, evidence, that, the, throne, was, ever, deified, the, cycle, of, myth, surrounding, osiris, s, death, and, resurrection, was, first, recorded, in, the, pyramid, texts, and, grew, into, the, most, elaborate, and, influential, of, all, egyptian, myths, isis, plays, a, more, active, role, in, this, myth, than, the, other, protagonists, so, as, it, developed, in, literature, from, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, 1070, bce, to, the, ptolemaic, period, 305, 30, bce, she, became, the, most, complex, literary, character, of, all, egyptian, deities, at, the, same, time, she, absorbed, characteristics, from, many, other, goddesses, broadening, her, significance, well, beyond, the, osiris, myth, isis, is, part, of, the, ennead, of, heliopolis, a, family, of, nine, deities, descended, from, the, creator, god, atum, or, ra, she, and, her, siblings, osiris, set, and, nephthys, are, the, last, generation, of, the, ennead, born, to, geb, god, of, the, earth, and, nut, goddess, of, the, sky, the, creator, god, the, world, s, original, ruler, passes, down, his, authority, through, the, male, generations, of, the, ennead, so, that, osiris, becomes, king, isis, who, is, osiris, s, wife, as, well, as, his, sister, is, his, queen, set, kills, osiris, and, in, several, versions, of, the, story, dismembers, his, corpse, isis, and, nephthys, along, with, other, deities, such, as, anubis, search, for, the, pieces, of, their, brother, s, body, and, reassemble, it, their, efforts, are, the, mythic, prototype, for, mummification, and, other, ancient, egyptian, funerary, practices, according, to, some, texts, they, must, also, protect, osiris, s, body, from, further, desecration, by, set, or, his, servants, isis, is, the, epitome, of, a, mourning, widow, her, and, nephthys, s, love, and, grief, for, their, brother, help, restore, him, to, life, as, does, isis, s, recitation, of, magical, spells, funerary, texts, contain, speeches, by, isis, in, which, she, expresses, her, sorrow, at, osiris, s, death, her, sexual, desire, for, him, and, even, anger, that, he, has, left, her, all, these, emotions, play, a, part, in, his, revival, as, they, are, meant, to, stir, him, into, action, finally, isis, restores, breath, and, life, to, osiris, s, body, and, copulates, with, him, conceiving, their, son, horus, after, this, point, osiris, lives, on, only, in, the, duat, or, underworld, but, by, producing, a, son, and, heir, to, avenge, his, death, and, carry, out, funerary, rites, for, him, isis, has, ensured, that, her, husband, will, endure, in, the, afterlife, isis, s, role, in, afterlife, beliefs, was, based, on, that, in, the, myth, she, helped, to, restore, the, souls, of, deceased, humans, to, wholeness, as, she, had, done, for, osiris, like, other, goddesses, such, as, hathor, she, also, acted, as, a, mother, to, the, deceased, providing, protection, and, nourishment, thus, like, hathor, she, sometimes, took, the, form, of, imentet, the, goddess, of, the, west, who, welcomed, the, deceased, soul, into, the, afterlife, as, her, child, but, for, much, of, egyptian, history, male, deities, such, as, osiris, were, believed, to, provide, the, regenerative, powers, including, sexual, potency, that, were, crucial, for, rebirth, isis, was, thought, to, merely, assist, by, stimulating, this, power, feminine, divine, powers, became, more, important, in, afterlife, beliefs, in, the, late, new, kingdom, various, ptolemaic, funerary, texts, emphasize, that, isis, took, the, active, role, in, horus, s, conception, by, sexually, stimulating, her, inert, husband, some, tomb, decoration, from, the, roman, period, in, egypt, depicts, isis, in, a, central, role, in, the, afterlife, and, a, funerary, text, from, that, era, suggests, that, women, were, thought, able, to, join, the, retinue, of, isis, and, nephthys, in, the, afterlife, isis, is, treated, as, the, mother, of, horus, even, in, the, earliest, copies, of, the, pyramid, texts, yet, there, are, signs, that, hathor, was, originally, regarded, as, his, mother, and, other, traditions, make, an, elder, form, of, horus, the, son, of, nut, and, a, sibling, of, isis, and, osiris, isis, may, only, have, come, to, be, horus, s, mother, as, the, osiris, myth, took, shape, during, the, old, kingdom, but, through, her, relationship, with, him, she, came, to, be, seen, as, the, epitome, of, maternal, devotion, in, the, developed, form, of, the, myth, isis, gives, birth, to, horus, after, a, long, pregnancy, and, a, difficult, labor, in, the, papyrus, thickets, of, the, nile, delta, as, her, child, grows, she, must, protect, him, from, set, and, many, other, hazards, snakes, scorpions, and, simple, illness, in, some, texts, isis, travels, among, humans, and, must, seek, their, help, according, to, one, such, story, seven, minor, scorpion, deities, travel, with, and, guard, her, they, take, revenge, on, a, wealthy, woman, who, has, refused, to, help, isis, by, stinging, the, woman, s, son, making, it, necessary, for, the, goddess, to, heal, the, blameless, child, isis, s, reputation, as, a, compassionate, deity, willing, to, relieve, human, suffering, contributed, greatly, to, her, appeal, isis, continues, to, assist, her, son, when, he, challenges, set, to, claim, the, kingship, that, set, has, usurped, although, mother, and, son, are, sometimes, portrayed, in, conflict, as, when, horus, beheads, isis, and, she, replaces, her, original, head, with, that, of, a, cow, an, origin, myth, explaining, the, cow, horn, headdress, that, isis, wears, isis, s, maternal, aspect, extended, to, other, deities, as, well, the, coffin, texts, from, the, middle, kingdom, c, 2055, 1650, bce, say, the, four, sons, of, horus, funerary, deities, who, were, thought, to, protect, the, internal, organs, of, the, deceased, were, the, offspring, of, isis, and, the, elder, form, of, horus, in, the, same, era, horus, was, syncretized, with, the, fertility, god, min, so, isis, was, regarded, as, min, s, mother, a, form, of, min, known, as, kamutef, bull, of, his, mother, who, represented, the, cyclical, regeneration, of, the, gods, and, of, kingship, was, said, to, impregnate, his, mother, to, engender, himself, thus, isis, was, also, regarded, as, min, s, consort, the, same, ideology, of, kingship, may, lie, behind, a, tradition, found, in, a, few, texts, that, horus, raped, isis, amun, the, foremost, egyptian, deity, during, the, middle, and, new, kingdoms, also, took, on, the, role, of, kamutef, and, when, he, was, in, this, form, isis, often, acted, as, his, consort, apis, a, bull, that, was, worshipped, as, a, living, god, at, memphis, was, said, to, be, isis, s, son, fathered, by, a, form, of, osiris, known, as, osiris, apis, the, biological, mother, of, each, apis, bull, was, thus, known, as, the, isis, cow, isis, was, said, to, be, the, mother, of, bastet, by, ra, a, story, in, the, westcar, papyrus, from, the, middle, kingdom, includes, isis, among, a, group, of, goddesses, who, serve, as, midwives, during, the, delivery, of, three, future, kings, she, serves, a, similar, role, in, new, kingdom, texts, that, describe, the, divinely, ordained, births, of, reigning, pharaohs, in, the, westcar, papyrus, isis, calls, out, the, names, of, the, three, children, as, they, are, born, barbara, s, lesko, sees, this, story, as, a, sign, that, isis, had, the, power, to, predict, or, influence, future, events, as, did, other, deities, who, presided, over, birth, such, as, shai, and, renenutet, texts, from, much, later, times, call, isis, mistress, of, life, ruler, of, fate, and, destiny, and, indicate, she, has, control, over, shai, and, renenutet, just, as, other, great, deities, such, as, amun, were, said, to, do, in, earlier, eras, of, egyptian, history, by, governing, these, deities, isis, determined, the, length, and, quality, of, human, lives, horus, was, equated, with, each, living, pharaoh, and, osiris, with, the, pharaoh, s, deceased, predecessors, isis, was, therefore, the, mythological, mother, and, wife, of, kings, in, the, pyramid, texts, her, primary, importance, to, the, king, was, as, one, of, the, deities, who, protected, and, assisted, him, in, the, afterlife, her, prominence, in, royal, ideology, grew, in, the, new, kingdom, temple, reliefs, from, that, time, on, show, the, king, nursing, at, isis, s, breast, her, milk, not, only, healed, her, child, but, symbolized, his, divine, right, to, rule, royal, ideology, increasingly, emphasized, the, importance, of, queens, as, earthly, counterparts, of, the, goddesses, who, served, as, wives, to, the, king, and, mothers, to, his, heirs, initially, the, most, important, of, these, goddesses, was, hathor, whose, attributes, in, art, were, incorporated, into, queens, crowns, but, because, of, her, own, mythological, links, with, queenship, isis, too, was, given, the, same, titles, and, regalia, as, human, queens, isis, s, actions, in, protecting, osiris, against, set, became, part, of, a, larger, more, warlike, aspect, of, her, character, new, kingdom, funerary, texts, portray, isis, in, the, barque, of, ra, as, he, sails, through, the, underworld, acting, as, one, of, several, deities, who, subdue, ra, s, archenemy, apep, kings, also, called, upon, her, protective, magical, power, against, human, enemies, in, her, ptolemaic, temple, at, philae, which, lay, near, the, frontier, with, nubian, peoples, who, raided, egypt, she, was, described, as, the, protectress, of, the, entire, nation, more, effective, in, battle, than, millions, of, soldiers, supporting, ptolemaic, kings, and, roman, emperors, in, their, efforts, to, subdue, egypt, s, enemies, isis, was, also, known, for, her, magical, power, which, enabled, her, to, revive, osiris, and, to, protect, and, heal, horus, and, for, her, cunning, by, virtue, of, her, magical, knowledge, she, was, said, to, be, more, clever, than, a, million, gods, in, several, episodes, in, the, new, kingdom, story, the, contendings, of, horus, and, set, isis, uses, these, abilities, to, outmaneuver, set, during, his, conflict, with, her, son, on, one, occasion, she, transforms, into, a, young, woman, who, tells, set, she, is, involved, in, an, inheritance, dispute, similar, to, set, s, usurpation, of, osiris, s, crown, when, set, calls, this, situation, unjust, isis, taunts, him, saying, he, has, judged, himself, to, be, in, the, wrong, in, later, texts, she, uses, her, powers, of, transformation, to, fight, and, destroy, set, and, his, followers, many, stories, about, isis, appear, as, historiolae, prologues, to, magical, texts, that, describe, mythic, events, related, to, the, goal, that, the, spell, aims, to, accomplish, in, one, spell, isis, creates, a, snake, that, bites, ra, who, is, older, and, greater, than, she, is, and, makes, him, ill, with, its, venom, she, offers, to, cure, ra, if, he, will, tell, her, his, true, secret, name, a, piece, of, knowledge, that, carries, with, it, incomparable, power, after, much, coercion, ra, tells, her, his, name, which, she, passes, on, to, horus, bolstering, his, royal, authority, the, story, may, be, meant, as, an, origin, story, to, explain, why, isis, s, magical, ability, surpasses, that, of, other, deities, but, because, she, uses, magic, to, subdue, ra, the, story, seems, to, treat, her, as, having, such, abilities, even, before, learning, his, name, many, of, the, roles, isis, acquired, gave, her, an, important, position, in, the, sky, passages, in, the, pyramid, texts, connect, isis, closely, with, sopdet, the, goddess, representing, the, star, sirius, whose, relationship, with, her, husband, sah, the, constellation, orion, and, their, son, sopdu, parallels, isis, s, relations, with, osiris, and, horus, sirius, s, heliacal, rising, just, before, the, start, of, the, nile, flood, gave, sopdet, a, close, connection, with, the, flood, and, the, resulting, growth, of, plants, partly, because, of, her, relationship, with, sopdet, isis, was, also, linked, with, the, flood, which, was, sometimes, equated, with, the, tears, she, shed, for, osiris, by, ptolemaic, times, she, was, connected, with, rain, which, egyptian, texts, call, a, nile, in, the, sky, with, the, sun, as, the, protector, of, ra, s, barque, and, with, the, moon, possibly, because, she, was, linked, with, the, greek, lunar, goddess, artemis, by, a, shared, connection, with, an, egyptian, fertility, goddess, bastet, in, hymns, inscribed, at, philae, she, is, called, the, lady, of, heaven, whose, dominion, over, the, sky, parallels, osiris, s, rule, over, the, duat, and, horus, s, kingship, on, earth, in, ptolemaic, times, isis, s, sphere, of, influence, could, include, the, entire, cosmos, as, the, deity, that, protected, egypt, and, endorsed, its, king, she, had, power, over, all, nations, and, as, the, provider, of, rain, she, enlivened, the, natural, world, the, philae, hymn, that, initially, calls, her, ruler, of, the, sky, goes, on, to, expand, her, authority, so, at, its, climax, her, dominion, encompasses, the, sky, earth, and, duat, it, says, her, power, over, nature, nourishes, humans, the, blessed, dead, and, the, gods, other, greek, language, hymns, from, ptolemaic, egypt, call, her, the, beautiful, essence, of, all, the, gods, in, the, course, of, egyptian, history, many, deities, major, and, minor, had, been, described, in, similar, grand, terms, amun, was, most, commonly, described, this, way, in, the, new, kingdom, whereas, in, roman, egypt, such, terms, tended, to, be, applied, to, isis, such, texts, do, not, deny, the, existence, of, other, deities, but, treat, them, as, aspects, of, the, supreme, deity, a, type, of, theology, sometimes, called, summodeism, in, the, late, ptolemaic, and, roman, periods, many, temples, contained, a, creation, myth, that, adapted, long, standing, ideas, about, creation, to, give, the, primary, roles, to, local, deities, at, philae, isis, is, described, as, the, creator, in, the, same, way, that, older, texts, speak, of, the, work, of, the, god, ptah, who, was, said, to, have, designed, the, world, with, his, intellect, and, sculpted, it, into, being, like, him, isis, formed, the, cosmos, through, what, her, heart, conceived, and, her, hands, created, like, other, deities, throughout, egyptian, history, isis, had, many, forms, in, her, individual, cult, centers, and, each, cult, center, emphasized, different, aspects, of, her, character, local, isis, cults, focused, on, the, distinctive, traits, of, their, deity, more, than, on, her, universality, whereas, some, egyptian, hymns, to, isis, treat, other, goddesses, in, cult, centers, from, across, egypt, and, the, mediterranean, as, manifestations, of, her, a, text, in, her, temple, at, dendera, says, in, each, nome, it, is, she, who, is, in, every, town, in, every, nome, with, her, son, horus, in, ancient, egyptian, art, isis, was, most, commonly, depicted, as, a, woman, with, the, typical, attributes, of, a, goddess, a, sheath, dress, a, staff, of, papyrus, in, one, hand, and, an, ankh, sign, in, the, other, her, original, headdress, was, the, throne, sign, used, in, writing, her, name, she, and, nephthys, often, appear, together, particularly, when, mourning, osiris, s, death, supporting, him, on, his, throne, or, protecting, the, sarcophagi, of, the, dead, in, these, situations, their, arms, are, often, flung, across, their, faces, in, a, gesture, of, mourning, or, outstretched, around, osiris, or, the, deceased, as, a, sign, of, their, protective, role, in, these, circumstances, they, were, often, depicted, as, kites, or, women, with, the, wings, of, kites, this, form, may, be, inspired, by, a, similarity, between, the, kites, calls, and, the, cries, of, wailing, women, or, by, a, metaphor, likening, the, kite, s, search, for, carrion, to, the, goddesses, search, for, their, dead, brother, isis, sometimes, appeared, in, other, animal, forms, as, a, sow, representing, her, maternal, character, as, a, cow, particularly, when, linked, with, apis, or, as, a, scorpion, she, also, took, the, form, of, a, tree, or, a, woman, emerging, from, a, tree, sometimes, offering, food, and, water, to, deceased, souls, this, form, alluded, to, the, maternal, nourishment, she, provided, beginning, in, the, new, kingdom, thanks, to, the, close, links, between, isis, and, hathor, isis, took, on, hathor, s, attributes, such, as, a, sistrum, rattle, and, a, headdress, of, cow, horns, enclosing, a, sun, disk, sometimes, both, headdresses, were, combined, so, the, throne, glyph, sat, atop, the, sun, disk, in, the, same, era, she, began, to, wear, the, insignia, of, a, human, queen, such, as, a, vulture, shaped, crown, on, her, head, and, the, royal, uraeus, or, rearing, cobra, on, her, brow, in, ptolemaic, and, roman, times, statues, and, figurines, of, isis, often, showed, her, in, a, greek, sculptural, style, with, attributes, taken, from, egyptian, and, greek, tradition, some, of, these, images, reflected, her, linkage, with, other, goddesses, in, novel, ways, isis, thermuthis, a, combination, of, isis, and, renenutet, who, represented, agricultural, fertility, was, depicted, in, this, style, as, a, woman, with, the, lower, body, of, a, snake, figurines, of, a, woman, wearing, an, elaborate, headdress, and, exposing, her, genitals, may, represent, isis, aphrodite, the, tyet, symbol, a, looped, shape, similar, to, the, ankh, came, to, be, seen, as, isis, s, emblem, at, least, as, early, as, the, new, kingdom, though, it, existed, long, before, it, was, often, made, of, red, jasper, and, likened, to, isis, s, blood, used, as, a, funerary, amulet, it, was, said, to, confer, her, protection, on, the, wearer, despite, her, significance, in, the, osiris, myth, isis, was, originally, a, minor, deity, in, the, ideology, surrounding, the, living, king, she, played, only, a, small, role, for, instance, in, the, dramatic, ramesseum, papyrus, the, script, for, royal, rituals, performed, in, the, reign, of, senusret, i, in, the, middle, kingdom, her, importance, grew, during, the, new, kingdom, when, she, was, increasingly, connected, with, hathor, and, the, human, queen, the, early, first, millennium, bce, saw, an, increased, emphasis, on, the, family, triad, of, osiris, isis, and, horus, and, an, explosive, growth, in, isis, s, popularity, in, the, fourth, century, bce, nectanebo, i, of, the, thirtieth, dynasty, claimed, isis, as, his, patron, deity, tying, her, still, more, closely, to, political, power, the, kingdom, of, kush, which, ruled, nubia, from, the, eighth, century, bce, to, the, fourth, century, ce, absorbed, and, adapted, the, egyptian, ideology, surrounding, kingship, it, equated, isis, with, the, kandake, the, queen, or, queen, mother, of, the, kushite, king, the, ptolemaic, greek, kings, who, ruled, egypt, as, pharaohs, from, 305, to, 30, bce, developed, an, ideology, that, linked, them, with, both, egyptian, and, greek, deities, to, strengthen, their, claim, to, the, throne, in, the, eyes, of, their, greek, and, egyptian, subjects, for, centuries, before, greek, colonists, and, visitors, to, egypt, had, drawn, parallels, between, egyptian, deities, and, their, own, in, a, process, known, as, interpretatio, graeca, herodotus, a, greek, who, wrote, about, egypt, in, the, fifth, century, bce, likened, isis, to, demeter, whose, mythical, search, for, her, daughter, persephone, resembled, isis, s, search, for, osiris, demeter, was, one, of, the, few, greek, deities, to, be, widely, adopted, by, egyptians, in, ptolemaic, times, so, the, similarity, between, her, and, isis, provided, a, link, between, the, two, cultures, in, other, cases, isis, was, linked, with, aphrodite, through, the, sexual, aspects, of, her, character, building, on, these, traditions, the, first, two, ptolemies, promoted, the, cult, of, the, new, god, serapis, who, combined, aspects, of, osiris, and, apis, with, those, of, greek, gods, such, as, zeus, and, dionysus, isis, portrayed, in, a, hellenized, form, was, regarded, as, the, consort, of, serapis, as, well, as, of, osiris, ptolemy, ii, and, his, sister, and, wife, arsinoe, ii, developed, a, ruler, cult, around, themselves, so, that, they, were, worshipped, in, the, same, temples, as, serapis, and, isis, and, arsinoe, was, likened, to, both, isis, and, aphrodite, some, later, ptolemaic, queens, identified, themselves, still, more, closely, with, isis, cleopatra, iii, in, the, second, century, bce, used, isis, s, name, in, place, of, her, own, in, inscriptions, and, cleopatra, vii, the, last, ruler, of, egypt, before, it, was, annexed, by, rome, used, the, epithet, the, new, isis, down, to, the, end, of, the, new, kingdom, isis, s, cult, was, closely, tied, to, those, of, male, deities, such, as, osiris, min, or, amun, she, was, commonly, worshipped, alongside, them, as, their, mother, or, consort, and, she, was, especially, widely, worshipped, as, the, mother, of, various, local, forms, of, horus, nevertheless, she, had, independent, priesthoods, at, some, sites, and, at, least, one, temple, of, her, own, at, osiris, s, cult, center, of, abydos, during, the, late, new, kingdom, the, earliest, known, major, temples, to, isis, were, the, iseion, at, behbeit, el, hagar, in, northern, egypt, and, philae, in, the, far, south, both, began, construction, during, the, thirtieth, dynasty, and, were, completed, or, enlarged, by, ptolemaic, kings, thanks, to, isis, s, widespread, fame, philae, drew, pilgrims, from, across, the, mediterranean, many, other, temples, of, isis, sprang, up, in, ptolemaic, times, ranging, from, alexandria, and, canopus, on, the, mediterranean, coast, to, egypt, s, frontier, with, nubia, a, series, of, temples, of, isis, stood, in, that, region, stretching, from, philae, south, to, maharraqa, and, were, sites, of, worship, for, both, egyptians, and, various, nubian, peoples, the, nubians, of, kush, built, their, own, temples, to, isis, at, sites, as, far, south, as, wad, ban, naqa, including, one, in, their, capital, meroe, the, most, frequent, temple, rite, for, any, deity, was, the, daily, offering, ritual, in, which, priests, clothed, the, deity, s, cult, image, and, offered, it, food, in, roman, times, temples, to, isis, in, egypt, could, be, built, either, in, egyptian, style, in, which, the, cult, image, was, in, a, secluded, sanctuary, accessible, only, to, priests, and, in, a, greco, roman, style, in, which, devotees, were, allowed, to, see, the, cult, image, greek, and, egyptian, culture, were, highly, intermingled, by, this, time, and, there, may, have, been, no, ethnic, separation, between, isis, s, worshippers, the, same, people, may, have, prayed, to, isis, outside, egyptian, style, temples, and, in, front, of, her, statue, inside, greek, style, temples, temples, celebrated, many, festivals, in, the, course, of, the, year, some, nationwide, and, some, very, local, an, elaborate, series, of, rites, were, performed, all, across, egypt, for, osiris, during, the, month, of, khoiak, and, isis, and, nephthys, were, prominent, in, these, rites, at, least, as, early, as, the, new, kingdom, in, ptolemaic, times, two, women, acted, out, the, roles, of, isis, and, nephthys, during, khoiak, singing, or, chanting, in, mourning, for, their, dead, brother, their, chants, are, preserved, in, the, festival, songs, of, isis, and, nephthys, and, lamentations, of, isis, and, nephthys, festivals, dedicated, to, isis, eventually, developed, in, roman, times, egyptians, across, the, country, celebrated, her, birthday, the, amesysia, by, carrying, the, local, cult, statue, of, isis, through, their, fields, probably, celebrating, her, powers, of, fertility, the, priests, at, philae, held, a, festival, every, ten, days, when, the, cult, statue, of, isis, visited, the, neighboring, island, of, bigeh, which, was, said, to, be, osiris, s, place, of, burial, and, the, priests, performed, funerary, rites, for, him, the, cult, statue, also, visited, the, neighboring, temples, to, the, south, even, during, the, last, centuries, of, activity, at, philae, when, those, temples, were, run, by, nubian, peoples, outside, roman, rule, christianity, became, the, dominant, religion, in, the, roman, empire, including, egypt, during, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, ce, egyptian, temple, cults, died, out, gradually, and, at, various, times, from, a, combination, of, lack, of, funds, and, christian, hostility, isis, s, temple, at, philae, supported, by, its, nubian, worshippers, still, had, an, organized, priesthood, and, regular, festivals, until, at, least, the, mid, fifth, century, ce, making, it, the, last, fully, functioning, temple, in, egypt, in, many, spells, in, the, pyramid, texts, isis, and, nephthys, help, the, deceased, king, reach, the, afterlife, in, the, coffin, texts, from, the, middle, kingdom, isis, appears, still, more, frequently, though, in, these, texts, osiris, is, credited, with, reviving, the, dead, more, often, than, she, is, new, kingdom, sources, such, as, the, book, of, the, dead, describe, isis, as, protecting, deceased, souls, as, they, face, the, dangers, in, the, duat, they, also, describe, isis, as, a, member, of, the, divine, councils, that, judge, souls, moral, righteousness, before, admitting, them, into, the, afterlife, and, she, appears, in, vignettes, standing, beside, osiris, as, he, presides, over, this, tribunal, isis, and, nephthys, took, part, in, funeral, ceremonies, where, two, wailing, women, much, like, those, in, the, festival, at, abydos, mourned, the, deceased, as, the, two, goddesses, mourned, osiris, isis, was, frequently, shown, or, alluded, to, in, funerary, equipment, on, sarcophagi, and, canopic, chests, as, one, of, the, four, goddesses, who, protected, the, four, sons, of, horus, in, tomb, art, offering, her, enlivening, milk, to, the, dead, and, in, the, tyet, amulets, that, were, often, placed, on, mummies, to, ensure, that, isis, s, power, would, shield, them, from, harm, late, funerary, texts, prominently, featured, her, mourning, for, osiris, and, one, such, text, one, of, the, books, of, breathing, was, said, to, have, been, written, by, her, for, osiris, s, benefit, in, nubian, funerary, religion, isis, was, regarded, as, more, significant, than, her, husband, because, she, was, the, active, partner, while, he, only, passively, received, the, offerings, she, made, to, sustain, him, in, the, afterlife, unlike, many, egyptian, deities, isis, was, rarely, addressed, in, prayers, or, invoked, in, personal, names, before, the, end, of, the, new, kingdom, from, the, late, period, on, she, became, one, of, the, deities, most, commonly, mentioned, in, these, sources, which, often, refer, to, her, kindly, character, and, her, willingness, to, answer, those, who, call, upon, her, for, help, hundreds, of, thousands, of, amulets, and, votive, statues, of, isis, nursing, horus, were, made, during, the, first, millennium, bce, and, in, roman, egypt, she, was, among, the, deities, most, commonly, represented, in, household, religious, art, such, as, figurines, and, panel, paintings, isis, was, prominent, in, magical, texts, from, the, middle, kingdom, onward, the, dangers, horus, faces, in, childhood, are, a, frequent, theme, in, magical, healing, spells, in, which, isis, s, efforts, to, heal, him, are, extended, to, cure, any, patient, in, many, of, these, spells, isis, forces, ra, to, help, horus, by, declaring, that, she, will, stop, the, sun, in, its, course, through, the, sky, unless, her, son, is, cured, other, spells, equated, pregnant, women, with, isis, to, ensure, that, they, would, deliver, their, children, successfully, egyptian, magic, began, to, incorporate, christian, concepts, as, christianity, was, established, in, egypt, but, egyptian, and, greek, deities, continued, to, appear, in, spells, long, after, their, temple, worship, had, ceased, spells, that, may, date, to, the, sixth, seventh, or, eighth, centuries, ce, invoke, the, name, of, isis, alongside, christian, figures, cults, based, in, a, particular, city, or, nation, were, the, norm, across, the, ancient, world, until, the, mid, to, late, first, millennium, bce, when, increased, contact, between, different, cultures, allowed, some, cults, to, spread, more, widely, greeks, were, aware, of, egyptian, deities, including, isis, at, least, as, early, as, the, archaic, period, c, 700, 480, bce, and, her, first, known, temple, in, greece, was, built, during, or, before, the, fourth, century, bce, by, egyptians, living, in, athens, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, late, in, that, century, created, hellenistic, kingdoms, around, the, mediterranean, and, near, east, including, ptolemaic, egypt, and, put, greek, and, non, greek, religions, in, much, closer, contact, the, resulting, diffusion, of, cultures, allowed, many, religious, traditions, to, spread, across, the, hellenistic, world, in, the, last, three, centuries, bce, the, new, mobile, cults, adapted, greatly, to, appeal, to, people, from, a, variety, of, cultures, the, cults, of, isis, and, serapis, were, among, those, that, expanded, in, this, way, spread, by, merchants, and, other, mediterranean, travelers, the, cults, of, isis, and, serapis, were, established, in, greek, port, cities, at, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, bce, and, expanded, throughout, greece, and, asia, minor, during, the, third, and, second, centuries, the, greek, island, of, delos, was, an, early, cult, center, for, both, deities, and, its, status, as, a, trading, center, made, it, a, springboard, for, the, egyptian, cults, to, diffuse, into, italy, isis, and, serapis, were, also, worshipped, at, scattered, sites, in, the, seleucid, empire, the, hellenistic, kingdom, in, the, middle, east, as, far, east, as, iran, though, they, disappeared, from, the, region, as, the, seleucids, lost, their, eastern, territory, to, the, parthian, empire, greeks, regarded, egyptian, religion, as, exotic, and, sometimes, bizarre, yet, full, of, ancient, wisdom, like, other, cults, from, the, eastern, regions, of, the, mediterranean, the, cult, of, isis, attracted, greeks, and, romans, by, playing, upon, its, exotic, origins, but, the, form, it, took, after, reaching, greece, was, heavily, hellenized, isis, s, cult, reached, italy, and, the, roman, sphere, of, influence, at, some, point, in, the, second, century, bce, it, was, one, of, many, cults, that, were, introduced, to, rome, as, the, roman, republic, s, territory, expanded, in, the, last, centuries, bce, authorities, in, the, republic, tried, to, define, which, cults, were, acceptable, and, which, were, not, as, a, way, of, defining, roman, cultural, identity, amid, the, cultural, changes, brought, on, by, rome, s, expansion, in, isis, s, case, shrines, and, altars, to, her, were, set, up, on, the, capitoline, hill, at, the, heart, of, the, city, by, private, persons, in, the, early, first, century, bce, the, independence, of, her, cult, from, the, control, of, roman, authorities, made, it, potentially, unsettling, to, them, in, the, 50s, and, 40s, bce, when, the, crisis, of, the, roman, republic, made, many, romans, fear, that, peace, among, the, gods, was, being, disrupted, the, roman, senate, destroyed, these, shrines, although, it, did, not, ban, isis, from, the, city, outright, egyptian, cults, faced, further, hostility, during, the, final, war, of, the, roman, republic, 32, 30, bce, when, rome, led, by, octavian, the, future, emperor, augustus, fought, egypt, under, cleopatra, vii, after, octavian, s, victory, he, banned, shrines, to, isis, and, serapis, within, the, pomerium, the, city, s, innermost, sacred, boundary, but, allowed, them, in, parts, of, the, city, outside, the, pomerium, thus, marking, egyptian, deities, as, non, roman, but, acceptable, to, rome, despite, being, temporarily, expelled, from, rome, during, the, reign, of, tiberius, 14, 37, ce, the, egyptian, cults, gradually, became, an, accepted, part, of, the, roman, religious, landscape, the, flavian, emperors, in, the, late, first, century, ce, treated, serapis, and, isis, as, patrons, of, their, rule, in, much, the, same, manner, as, traditional, roman, deities, such, as, jupiter, and, minerva, even, as, it, was, being, integrated, into, roman, culture, isis, s, worship, developed, new, features, that, emphasized, its, egyptian, background, the, cults, also, expanded, into, rome, s, western, provinces, beginning, along, the, mediterranean, coast, in, early, imperial, times, at, their, peak, in, the, late, second, and, early, third, centuries, ce, isis, and, serapis, were, worshipped, in, most, towns, across, the, western, empire, though, without, much, presence, in, the, countryside, their, temples, were, found, from, petra, and, palmyra, in, the, arabian, and, syrian, provinces, to, italica, in, spain, and, londinium, in, britain, by, this, time, they, were, on, a, comparable, footing, with, native, roman, deities, isis, s, cult, like, others, in, the, greco, roman, world, had, no, firm, dogma, and, its, beliefs, and, practices, may, have, stayed, only, loosely, similar, as, it, diffused, across, the, region, and, evolved, over, time, greek, aretalogies, that, praise, isis, provide, much, of, the, information, about, these, beliefs, parts, of, these, aretalogies, closely, resemble, ideas, in, late, egyptian, hymns, like, those, at, philae, while, other, elements, are, thoroughly, greek, other, information, comes, from, plutarch, c, 46, 120, ce, whose, book, on, isis, and, osiris, interprets, the, egyptian, deities, based, on, his, middle, platonist, philosophy, and, from, several, works, of, greek, and, latin, literature, that, refer, to, isis, s, worship, especially, a, novel, by, apuleius, c, 125, 180, ce, known, as, metamorphoses, or, the, golden, ass, which, ends, by, describing, how, the, main, character, has, a, vision, of, the, goddess, and, becomes, her, devotee, elaborating, upon, isis, s, role, as, a, wife, and, mother, in, the, osiris, myth, aretalogies, call, her, the, inventor, of, marriage, and, parenthood, she, was, invoked, to, protect, women, in, childbirth, and, in, ancient, greek, novels, such, as, the, ephesian, tale, to, protect, their, virginity, some, ancient, texts, called, her, the, patroness, of, women, in, general, her, cult, may, have, served, to, promote, women, s, autonomy, in, a, limited, way, with, isis, s, power, and, authority, serving, as, a, precedent, but, in, myth, she, was, devoted, to, and, never, fully, independent, of, her, husband, and, son, the, aretalogies, show, ambiguous, attitudes, toward, women, s, independence, one, says, isis, made, women, equal, to, men, whereas, another, says, she, made, women, subordinate, to, their, husbands, isis, was, often, characterized, as, a, moon, goddess, paralleling, the, solar, characteristics, of, serapis, she, was, also, seen, as, a, cosmic, goddess, more, generally, various, texts, claim, she, organized, the, behavior, of, the, sun, moon, and, stars, governing, time, and, the, seasons, which, in, turn, guaranteed, the, fertility, of, the, earth, these, texts, also, credit, her, with, inventing, agriculture, establishing, laws, and, devising, or, promoting, other, elements, of, human, society, this, idea, derives, from, older, greek, traditions, about, the, role, of, various, greek, deities, and, culture, heroes, including, demeter, in, establishing, civilization, she, also, oversaw, seas, and, harbors, sailors, left, inscriptions, calling, upon, her, to, ensure, the, safety, and, good, fortune, of, their, voyages, in, this, role, she, was, called, isis, pelagia, isis, of, the, sea, or, isis, pharia, referring, to, a, sail, or, to, the, island, of, pharos, site, of, the, lighthouse, of, alexandria, this, form, of, isis, which, emerged, in, hellenistic, times, may, have, been, inspired, by, egyptian, images, of, isis, in, a, barque, as, well, as, by, greek, deities, who, protected, seafaring, such, as, aphrodite, isis, pelagia, developed, an, added, significance, in, rome, rome, s, food, supply, was, dependent, on, grain, shipments, from, its, provinces, especially, egypt, isis, therefore, guaranteed, fertile, harvests, and, protected, the, ships, that, carried, the, resulting, food, across, the, seas, and, thus, ensured, the, well, being, of, the, empire, as, a, whole, her, protection, of, the, state, was, said, to, extend, to, rome, s, armies, much, as, it, was, in, ptolemaic, egypt, and, she, was, sometimes, called, isis, invicta, unconquered, isis, her, roles, were, so, numerous, that, she, came, to, be, called, myrionymos, one, with, countless, names, and, panthea, all, goddess, both, plutarch, and, a, later, philosopher, proclus, mentioned, a, veiled, statue, of, the, egyptian, goddess, neith, whom, they, conflated, with, isis, citing, it, as, an, example, of, her, universality, and, enigmatic, wisdom, it, bore, the, words, i, am, all, that, has, been, and, is, and, will, be, and, no, mortal, has, ever, lifted, my, mantle, isis, was, also, said, to, benefit, her, followers, in, the, afterlife, which, was, not, much, emphasized, in, greek, and, roman, religion, the, golden, ass, and, inscriptions, left, by, worshippers, of, isis, suggest, that, many, of, her, followers, thought, she, would, guarantee, them, a, better, afterlife, in, return, for, their, devotion, they, characterized, this, afterlife, inconsistently, some, said, they, would, benefit, from, osiris, s, enlivening, water, while, others, expected, to, sail, to, the, fortunate, isles, of, greek, tradition, as, in, egypt, isis, was, said, to, have, power, over, fate, which, in, traditional, greek, religion, was, a, power, not, even, the, gods, could, defy, valentino, gasparini, says, this, control, over, destiny, binds, together, isis, s, disparate, traits, she, governs, the, cosmos, yet, she, also, relieves, people, of, their, comparatively, trivial, misfortunes, and, her, influence, extends, into, the, realm, of, death, which, is, individual, and, universal, at, the, same, time, more, than, a, dozen, egyptian, deities, were, worshipped, outside, egypt, in, hellenistic, and, roman, times, in, a, series, of, interrelated, cults, though, many, were, fairly, minor, of, the, most, important, of, these, deities, serapis, was, closely, connected, with, isis, and, often, appeared, with, her, in, art, but, osiris, remained, central, to, her, myth, and, prominent, in, her, rituals, temples, to, isis, and, serapis, sometimes, stood, next, to, each, other, but, it, was, rare, for, a, single, temple, to, be, dedicated, to, both, osiris, as, a, dead, deity, unlike, the, immortal, gods, of, greece, seemed, strange, to, greeks, and, played, only, a, minor, role, in, egyptian, cults, in, hellenistic, times, in, roman, times, he, became, like, dionysus, a, symbol, of, a, joyous, afterlife, and, the, isis, cult, increasingly, focused, on, him, horus, often, under, the, name, harpocrates, also, appeared, in, isis, s, temples, as, her, son, by, osiris, or, serapis, he, absorbed, traits, from, greek, deities, such, as, apollo, and, served, as, a, god, of, the, sun, and, of, crops, another, member, of, the, group, was, anubis, who, was, linked, to, the, greek, god, hermes, in, his, hellenized, form, hermanubis, isis, was, also, sometimes, said, to, have, learned, her, wisdom, from, or, even, be, the, daughter, of, thoth, the, egyptian, god, of, writing, and, knowledge, who, was, known, in, the, greco, roman, world, as, hermes, trismegistus, isis, also, had, an, extensive, network, of, connections, with, greek, and, roman, deities, as, well, as, some, from, other, cultures, she, was, not, fully, integrated, into, the, greek, pantheon, but, she, was, at, different, times, equated, with, a, variety, of, greek, mythological, figures, including, demeter, aphrodite, or, io, a, human, woman, who, was, turned, into, a, cow, and, chased, by, the, goddess, hera, from, greece, to, egypt, the, cult, of, demeter, was, an, especially, important, influence, on, isis, s, worship, after, its, arrival, in, greece, isis, s, relationship, with, women, was, influenced, by, her, frequent, equation, with, artemis, who, had, a, dual, role, as, a, virgin, goddess, and, a, promoter, of, fertility, because, of, isis, s, power, over, fate, she, was, linked, with, the, greek, and, roman, personifications, of, fortune, tyche, and, fortuna, at, byblos, in, phoenicia, in, the, second, millennium, bce, hathor, had, been, worshipped, as, a, form, of, the, local, goddess, baalat, gebal, isis, gradually, replaced, hathor, there, in, the, course, of, the, first, millennium, bce, and, became, syncretized, with, another, goddess, from, the, region, astarte, in, noricum, in, central, europe, isis, was, syncretized, with, the, local, tutelary, deity, noreia, and, at, petra, she, may, have, been, linked, with, the, arab, goddess, al, uzza, the, roman, author, tacitus, said, isis, was, worshipped, by, the, suebi, a, germanic, people, living, outside, the, empire, but, he, may, have, mistaken, a, germanic, goddess, for, isis, because, like, her, the, goddess, was, symbolized, by, a, ship, many, of, the, aretalogies, include, long, lists, of, goddesses, with, whom, isis, was, linked, these, texts, treat, all, the, deities, they, list, as, forms, of, her, suggesting, that, in, the, eyes, of, the, authors, she, was, a, summodeistic, being, the, one, goddess, for, the, entire, civilized, world, in, the, roman, religious, world, many, deities, were, referred, to, as, one, or, unique, in, religious, texts, like, these, at, the, same, time, hellenistic, philosophers, frequently, saw, the, unifying, abstract, principle, of, the, cosmos, as, divine, many, of, them, reinterpreted, traditional, religions, to, fit, their, concept, of, this, highest, being, as, plutarch, did, with, isis, and, osiris, in, the, golden, ass, isis, says, my, one, person, manifests, the, aspects, of, all, the, gods, and, goddesses, and, that, she, is, worshipped, by, all, the, world, under, different, forms, with, various, rites, and, by, manifold, names, although, the, egyptians, and, nubians, use, her, true, name, isis, but, when, she, lists, the, forms, in, which, various, mediterranean, peoples, worship, her, she, mentions, only, female, deities, greco, roman, deities, were, firmly, divided, by, gender, thus, limiting, how, universal, isis, could, truly, be, one, aretalogy, avoids, this, problem, by, calling, isis, and, serapis, who, was, often, said, to, subsume, many, male, gods, the, two, unique, deities, similarly, both, plutarch, and, apuleius, limit, isis, s, importance, by, treating, her, as, ultimately, subordinate, to, osiris, the, claim, that, she, was, unique, was, meant, to, emphasize, her, greatness, more, than, to, make, a, precise, theological, statement, images, of, isis, made, outside, egypt, were, hellenistic, in, style, like, many, of, the, images, of, her, made, in, egypt, in, hellenistic, and, roman, times, the, attributes, she, bore, varied, widely, she, sometimes, wore, the, hathoric, cow, horn, headdress, but, greeks, and, romans, reduced, its, size, and, often, interpreted, it, as, a, crescent, moon, she, could, also, wear, headdresses, incorporating, leaves, flowers, or, ears, of, grain, other, common, traits, included, corkscrew, locks, of, hair, and, an, elaborate, mantle, tied, in, a, large, knot, over, the, breasts, which, originated, in, ordinary, egyptian, clothing, but, was, treated, as, a, symbol, of, the, goddess, outside, egypt, in, her, hands, she, could, carry, a, uraeus, or, a, sistrum, both, taken, from, her, egyptian, iconography, or, a, situla, a, vessel, used, for, libations, of, water, or, milk, that, were, performed, in, isis, s, cult, as, isis, fortuna, or, isis, tyche, she, held, a, rudder, representing, control, of, fate, in, her, right, hand, and, a, cornucopia, standing, for, abundance, in, her, left, as, isis, pharia, she, wore, a, cloak, that, billowed, behind, her, like, a, sail, and, as, isis, lactans, she, nursed, harpocrates, at, times, she, was, shown, resting, a, foot, on, a, celestial, sphere, representing, her, control, of, the, cosmos, the, diverse, imagery, sprang, from, her, varied, roles, as, robert, steven, bianchi, says, isis, could, represent, anything, to, anyone, and, could, be, represented, in, any, way, imaginable, like, most, cults, of, the, time, the, isis, cult, did, not, require, its, devotees, to, worship, isis, exclusively, and, their, level, of, commitment, probably, varied, greatly, some, devotees, of, isis, served, as, priests, in, a, variety, of, cults, and, underwent, several, initiations, dedicated, to, different, deities, nevertheless, many, emphasized, their, strong, devotion, to, her, and, some, considered, her, the, focus, of, their, lives, they, were, among, the, very, few, religious, groups, in, the, greco, roman, world, to, have, a, distinctive, name, for, themselves, loosely, equivalent, to, jew, or, christian, that, might, indicate, they, defined, themselves, by, their, religious, affiliation, however, the, word, isiacus, or, isiac, was, rarely, used, isiacs, were, a, very, small, proportion, of, the, roman, empire, s, population, but, they, came, from, every, level, of, society, from, slaves, and, freedmen, to, high, officials, and, members, of, the, imperial, family, ancient, accounts, imply, that, isis, was, popular, with, lower, social, classes, providing, a, possible, reason, why, authorities, in, the, roman, republic, troubled, by, struggles, between, classes, regarded, her, cult, with, suspicion, women, were, more, strongly, represented, in, the, isis, cult, than, in, most, greco, roman, cults, and, in, imperial, times, they, could, serve, as, priestesses, in, many, of, the, same, positions, in, the, hierarchy, as, their, male, counterparts, women, make, up, much, less, than, half, of, the, isiacs, known, from, inscriptions, and, are, rarely, listed, among, the, higher, ranks, of, priests, but, because, women, are, underrepresented, in, roman, inscriptions, their, participation, may, have, been, greater, than, is, recorded, several, roman, writers, accused, isis, s, cult, of, encouraging, promiscuity, among, women, jaime, alvar, suggests, the, cult, attracted, male, suspicion, simply, because, it, gave, women, a, venue, to, act, outside, their, husbands, control, priests, of, isis, were, known, for, their, distinctive, shaven, heads, and, white, linen, clothes, both, characteristics, drawn, from, egyptian, priesthoods, and, their, requirements, of, ritual, purity, a, temple, of, isis, could, include, several, ranks, of, priests, as, well, as, various, cultic, associations, and, specialized, duties, for, lay, devotees, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, hierarchy, overseeing, multiple, temples, and, each, temple, may, well, have, functioned, independently, of, the, others, temples, to, egyptian, deities, outside, egypt, such, as, the, red, basilica, in, pergamon, the, temple, of, isis, at, pompeii, or, the, iseum, campense, in, rome, were, built, in, a, largely, greco, roman, style, but, like, egyptian, temples, were, surrounded, by, large, courts, enclosed, by, walls, they, were, decorated, with, egyptian, themed, artwork, sometimes, including, antiquities, imported, from, egypt, their, layout, was, more, elaborate, than, that, of, traditional, roman, temples, and, included, rooms, for, housing, priests, and, for, various, ritual, functions, with, a, cult, statue, of, the, goddess, in, a, secluded, sanctuary, unlike, egyptian, cult, images, isis, s, hellenistic, and, roman, statues, were, life, size, or, larger, the, daily, ritual, still, entailed, dressing, the, statue, in, elaborate, clothes, each, morning, and, offering, it, libations, but, in, contrast, with, egyptian, tradition, the, priests, allowed, ordinary, devotees, of, isis, to, see, the, cult, statue, during, the, morning, ritual, pray, to, it, directly, and, sing, hymns, before, it, another, object, of, veneration, in, these, temples, was, water, which, was, treated, as, a, symbol, of, the, waters, of, the, nile, isis, temples, built, in, hellenistic, times, often, included, underground, cisterns, that, stored, this, sacred, water, raising, and, lowering, the, water, level, in, imitation, of, the, nile, flood, many, roman, temples, instead, used, a, pitcher, of, water, that, was, worshipped, as, a, cult, image, or, manifestation, of, osiris, roman, lararia, or, household, shrines, contained, statuettes, of, the, penates, a, varied, group, of, protective, deities, chosen, based, on, the, preferences, of, the, members, of, the, household, isis, and, other, egyptian, deities, were, found, in, lararia, in, italy, from, the, late, first, century, bce, to, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, century, ce, the, cult, asked, both, ritual, and, moral, purity, of, its, devotees, periodically, requiring, ritual, baths, or, days, long, periods, of, sexual, abstinence, isiacs, sometimes, displayed, their, piety, on, irregular, occasions, singing, isis, s, praises, in, the, streets, or, as, a, form, of, penance, declaring, their, misdeeds, in, public, some, temples, to, greek, deities, including, serapis, practiced, incubation, in, which, worshippers, slept, in, a, temple, hoping, that, the, god, would, appear, to, them, in, a, dream, and, give, them, advice, or, heal, their, ailments, some, scholars, believe, that, this, practice, took, place, in, isis, s, temples, but, there, is, no, firm, evidence, that, it, did, isis, was, however, thought, to, communicate, through, dreams, in, other, circumstances, including, to, call, worshippers, to, undergo, initiation, some, temples, of, isis, performed, mystery, rites, to, initiate, new, members, of, the, cult, these, rites, were, claimed, to, be, of, egyptian, origin, and, may, have, drawn, on, the, secretive, tendencies, of, some, egyptian, rites, however, they, were, mainly, based, on, greek, mystery, cults, especially, the, eleusinian, mysteries, dedicated, to, demeter, colored, with, egyptian, elements, although, mystery, rites, are, among, the, best, known, elements, of, isis, s, greco, roman, cult, they, are, only, known, to, have, been, performed, in, italy, greece, and, asia, minor, by, giving, the, devotee, a, dramatic, mystical, experience, of, the, goddess, initiations, added, emotional, intensity, to, the, process, of, joining, her, following, the, golden, ass, in, describing, how, the, protagonist, joins, isis, s, cult, gives, the, only, detailed, account, of, isiac, initiation, apuleius, s, motives, for, writing, about, the, cult, and, the, accuracy, of, his, fictionalized, description, are, much, debated, but, the, account, is, broadly, consistent, with, other, evidence, about, initiations, and, scholars, rely, heavily, on, it, when, studying, the, subject, ancient, mystery, rites, used, a, variety, of, intense, experiences, such, as, nocturnal, darkness, interrupted, by, bright, light, and, loud, music, and, noise, to, overwhelm, their, senses, and, give, them, an, intense, religious, experience, that, felt, like, direct, contact, with, the, god, they, devoted, themselves, to, apuleius, s, protagonist, lucius, undergoes, a, series, of, initiations, though, only, the, first, is, described, in, detail, after, entering, the, innermost, part, of, isis, s, temple, at, night, he, says, i, came, to, the, boundary, of, death, and, having, trodden, on, the, threshold, of, proserpina, i, travelled, through, all, the, elements, and, returned, in, the, middle, of, the, night, i, saw, the, sun, flashing, with, bright, light, i, came, face, to, face, with, the, gods, below, and, the, gods, above, and, paid, reverence, to, them, from, close, at, hand, this, cryptic, description, suggests, that, the, initiate, s, symbolic, journey, to, the, world, of, the, dead, was, likened, to, osiris, s, rebirth, as, well, as, to, ra, s, journey, through, the, underworld, in, egyptian, myth, possibly, implying, that, isis, brought, the, initiate, back, from, death, as, she, did, her, husband, roman, calendars, listed, the, two, most, important, festivals, of, isis, as, early, as, the, first, century, ce, the, first, festival, was, the, navigium, isidis, in, march, which, celebrated, isis, s, influence, over, the, sea, and, served, as, a, prayer, for, the, safety, of, seafarers, and, eventually, of, the, roman, people, and, their, leaders, it, consisted, of, an, elaborate, procession, including, isiac, priests, and, devotees, with, a, wide, variety, of, costumes, and, sacred, emblems, carrying, a, model, ship, from, the, local, isis, temple, to, the, sea, or, to, a, nearby, river, the, other, was, the, isia, in, late, october, and, early, november, like, its, egyptian, forerunner, the, khoiak, festival, the, isia, included, a, ritual, reenactment, of, isis, s, search, for, osiris, followed, by, jubilation, when, the, god, s, body, was, found, several, more, minor, festivals, were, dedicated, to, isis, including, the, pelusia, in, late, march, that, may, have, celebrated, the, birth, of, harpocrates, and, the, lychnapsia, or, lamp, lit, festival, that, celebrated, isis, s, own, birth, on, august, 12, festivals, of, isis, and, other, polytheistic, deities, were, celebrated, throughout, the, fourth, century, ce, despite, the, growth, of, christianity, in, that, era, and, the, persecution, of, pagans, that, intensified, toward, the, end, of, the, century, the, isia, was, celebrated, at, least, as, late, as, 417, ce, and, the, navigium, isidis, lasted, well, into, the, sixth, century, increasingly, the, religious, meaning, of, all, roman, festivals, was, forgotten, or, ignored, even, as, the, customs, continued, in, some, cases, these, customs, became, part, of, the, combined, classical, and, christian, culture, of, the, early, middle, ages, a, contentious, question, about, isis, is, whether, her, cult, influenced, christianity, some, isiac, customs, may, have, been, among, the, pagan, religious, practices, that, were, incorporated, into, christian, traditions, as, the, roman, empire, was, christianized, andreas, alf, ldi, for, instance, argued, in, the, 1930s, that, the, medieval, carnival, festival, in, which, a, model, boat, was, carried, developed, from, the, navigium, isidis, much, attention, focuses, on, whether, traits, of, christianity, were, borrowed, from, pagan, mystery, cults, including, that, of, isis, the, more, devoted, members, of, isis, s, cult, made, a, personal, commitment, to, a, deity, they, regarded, as, superior, to, others, as, christians, did, both, christianity, and, the, isis, cult, had, an, initiation, rite, the, mysteries, for, isis, baptism, in, christianity, one, of, the, mystery, cults, shared, themes, a, god, whose, death, and, resurrection, may, be, connected, with, the, individual, worshipper, s, well, being, in, the, afterlife, resembles, the, central, theme, of, christianity, the, suggestion, that, christianity, s, basic, beliefs, were, taken, from, mystery, cults, has, provoked, heated, debate, for, more, than, 200, years, in, response, to, these, controversies, both, hugh, bowden, and, jaime, alvar, scholars, who, study, ancient, mystery, cults, suggest, that, similarities, between, christianity, and, the, mystery, cults, were, not, produced, by, direct, borrowing, of, ideas, but, by, their, common, background, the, greco, roman, culture, in, which, they, all, developed, similarities, between, isis, and, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, have, also, been, scrutinized, they, have, been, subject, to, controversy, between, protestant, christians, and, the, catholic, church, as, many, protestants, have, argued, that, catholic, veneration, of, mary, is, a, remnant, of, paganism, the, classicist, r, e, witt, saw, isis, as, the, great, forerunner, of, mary, he, suggested, that, converts, to, christianity, who, had, formerly, worshipped, isis, would, have, seen, mary, in, much, the, same, terms, as, their, traditional, goddess, he, pointed, out, that, the, two, had, several, spheres, of, influence, in, common, such, as, agriculture, and, the, protection, of, sailors, he, compared, mary, s, title, mother, of, god, to, isis, s, epithet, mother, of, the, god, and, mary, s, queen, of, heaven, to, isis, s, queen, of, heaven, stephen, benko, a, historian, of, early, christianity, argues, that, devotion, to, mary, was, deeply, influenced, by, the, worship, of, several, goddesses, not, just, isis, in, contrast, john, mcguckin, a, church, historian, says, that, mary, absorbed, superficial, traits, from, these, goddesses, such, as, iconography, but, the, fundamentals, of, her, cult, were, thoroughly, christian, images, of, isis, with, horus, in, her, lap, are, often, suggested, as, an, influence, on, the, iconography, of, mary, particularly, images, of, the, mary, nursing, the, infant, jesus, as, images, of, nursing, women, were, rare, in, the, ancient, mediterranean, world, outside, egypt, vincent, tran, tam, tinh, points, out, that, the, latest, images, of, isis, nursing, horus, date, to, the, fourth, century, ce, while, the, earliest, images, of, mary, nursing, jesus, date, to, the, seventh, century, ce, sabrina, higgins, drawing, on, his, study, argues, that, if, there, is, a, connection, between, the, iconographies, of, isis, and, mary, it, is, limited, to, images, from, egypt, in, contrast, thomas, f, mathews, and, norman, muller, think, isis, s, pose, in, late, antique, panel, paintings, influenced, several, types, of, marian, icons, inside, and, outside, egypt, elizabeth, bolman, says, these, early, egyptian, images, of, mary, nursing, jesus, were, meant, to, emphasize, his, divinity, much, as, images, of, nursing, goddesses, did, in, ancient, egyptian, iconography, higgins, argues, that, such, similarities, prove, that, images, of, isis, influenced, those, of, mary, but, not, that, christians, deliberately, adopted, isis, s, iconography, or, other, elements, of, her, cult, the, memory, of, isis, survived, the, extinction, of, her, worship, like, the, greeks, and, romans, many, modern, europeans, have, regarded, ancient, egypt, as, the, home, of, profound, and, often, mystical, wisdom, and, this, wisdom, has, often, been, linked, with, isis, giovanni, boccaccio, s, biography, of, isis, in, his, 1374, work, de, mulieribus, claris, based, on, classical, sources, treated, her, as, a, historical, queen, who, taught, skills, of, civilization, to, humankind, some, renaissance, thinkers, elaborated, this, perspective, on, isis, annio, da, viterbo, in, the, 1490s, claimed, isis, and, osiris, had, civilized, italy, before, greece, thus, drawing, a, direct, connection, between, his, home, country, and, egypt, the, borgia, apartments, painted, for, annio, s, patron, pope, alexander, vi, incorporate, this, same, theme, in, their, illustrated, rendition, of, the, osiris, myth, western, esotericism, has, often, made, reference, to, isis, two, roman, esoteric, texts, used, the, mythic, motif, in, which, isis, passes, down, secret, knowledge, to, horus, in, kore, kosmou, she, teaches, him, wisdom, passed, down, from, hermes, trismegistus, and, in, the, early, alchemical, text, isis, the, prophetess, to, her, son, horus, she, gives, him, alchemical, recipes, early, modern, esoteric, literature, which, saw, hermes, trismegistus, as, an, egyptian, sage, and, frequently, made, use, of, texts, attributed, to, his, hand, sometimes, referred, to, isis, as, well, in, a, different, vein, apuleius, s, description, of, isiac, initiation, has, influenced, the, practices, of, many, secret, societies, jean, terrasson, s, 1731, novel, sethos, used, apuleius, as, inspiration, for, a, fanciful, egyptian, initiation, rite, dedicated, to, isis, it, was, imitated, by, actual, rituals, in, various, masonic, and, masonic, inspired, societies, during, the, eighteenth, century, as, well, as, in, other, literary, works, most, notably, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, s, 1791, opera, the, magic, flute, from, the, renaissance, on, the, veiled, statue, of, isis, that, plutarch, and, proclus, mentioned, was, interpreted, as, a, personification, of, nature, based, on, a, passage, in, the, works, of, macrobius, in, the, fifth, century, ce, that, equated, isis, with, nature, authors, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, ascribed, a, wide, variety, of, meanings, to, this, image, isis, represented, nature, as, the, mother, of, all, things, as, a, set, of, truths, waiting, to, be, unveiled, by, science, as, a, symbol, of, the, pantheist, concept, of, an, anonymous, enigmatic, deity, who, was, immanent, within, nature, or, as, an, awe, inspiring, sublime, power, that, could, be, experienced, through, ecstatic, mystery, rites, in, the, dechristianization, of, france, during, the, french, revolution, she, served, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, christianity, a, symbol, that, could, represent, nature, modern, scientific, wisdom, and, a, link, to, the, pre, christian, past, for, these, reasons, isis, s, image, appeared, in, artwork, sponsored, by, the, revolutionary, government, such, as, the, fontaine, de, la, r, g, n, ration, and, by, the, first, french, empire, the, metaphor, of, isis, s, veil, continued, to, circulate, through, the, nineteenth, century, helena, blavatsky, the, founder, of, the, esoteric, theosophical, tradition, titled, her, 1877, book, on, theosophy, isis,

movement, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, as, egypt, gained, independence, from, british, rule, in, works, such, as, mohamed, naghi, s, painting, in, the, parliament, of, egypt, titled, egypt, s,

disparate, as, advertisements, and, personal, names, the, name, isidoros, meaning, gift, of, isis, in, greek, survived, in, christianity, despite, its, pagan, origins, giving, rise, to, the, english, name, isidore, and, its, variants, in, the, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, isis, itself, became, a, popular, feminine, given, name, isis, continues, to, appear, in, modern, esoteric, and, pagan, belief, systems, the, concept, of, a, single, goddess, incarnating, all, feminine, divine, powers, partly, inspired, by, apuleius, became, a, widespread, theme, in, literature, of, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, influential, groups, and, figures, in, esotericism, such, as, the, hermetic, order, of, the, golden, dawn, in, the, late, nineteenth, century,
