protestantism, is, a, branch, of, christianity, that, emphasizes, justification, of, sinners, through, faith, alone, the, teaching, that, salvation, comes, by, unmerited, divine, grace, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, and, the, bible, as, the, sole, infallible, source, of, authority, for, christian, faith, and, practice, the, five, solae, summarize, the, basic, theological, beliefs, of, mainstream, protestantism, protestants, follow, the, theological, tenets, of, the, protestant, reformation, a, movement, that, began, in, the, 16th, century, with, the, goal, of, reforming, the, catholic, church, from, perceived, errors, abuses, and, discrepancies, the, reformation, began, in, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1517, when, martin, luther, published, his, ninety, five, theses, as, a, reaction, against, abuses, in, the, sale, of, indulgences, by, the, catholic, church, which, purported, to, offer, the, remission, of, the, temporal, punishment, of, sins, to, their, purchasers, the, term, however, derives, from, the, letter, of, protestation, from, german, lutheran, princes, in, 1529, against, an, edict, of, the, diet, of, speyer, condemning, the, teachings, of, martin, luther, as, heretical, in, the, 16th, century, lutheranism, spread, from, germany, into, denmark, norway, sweden, finland, livonia, and, iceland, calvinist, churches, spread, in, germany, hungary, the, netherlands, scotland, switzerland, france, poland, and, lithuania, by, protestant, reformers, such, as, john, calvin, huldrych, zwingli, and, john, knox, the, political, separation, of, the, church, of, england, from, the, roman, catholic, church, under, king, henry, viii, began, anglicanism, bringing, england, and, wales, into, this, broad, reformation, movement, under, the, leadership, of, reformer, thomas, cranmer, whose, work, forged, anglican, doctrine, and, identity, protestantism, is, diverse, being, divided, into, various, denominations, on, the, basis, of, theology, and, ecclesiology, not, forming, a, single, structure, as, with, the, catholic, church, eastern, orthodoxy, or, oriental, orthodoxy, protestants, adhere, to, the, concept, of, an, invisible, church, in, contrast, to, the, catholic, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, and, the, ancient, church, of, the, east, which, all, understand, themselves, as, the, one, and, only, original, church, the, one, true, church, founded, by, jesus, christ, though, certain, protestant, denominations, including, historic, lutheranism, hold, to, this, position, some, denominations, do, have, a, worldwide, scope, and, distribution, of, church, membership, while, others, are, confined, to, a, single, country, a, majority, of, protestants, are, members, of, a, handful, of, protestant, denominational, families, adventists, anabaptists, anglicans, episcopalians, baptists, calvinist, reformed, lutherans, methodists, moravians, plymouth, brethren, presbyterians, and, quakers, nondenominational, charismatic, and, independent, churches, are, also, on, the, rise, having, recently, expanded, rapidly, throughout, much, of, the, world, and, constitute, a, significant, part, of, protestantism, these, various, movements, collectively, labeled, popular, protestantism, by, scholars, such, as, peter, l, berger, have, been, called, one, of, the, contemporary, world, s, most, dynamic, religious, movements, today, it, is, the, second, largest, form, of, christianity, with, a, total, of, 0, 8, 1, 05, billion, adherents, worldwide, or, about, 36, 7, to, 40, of, all, christians, six, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, rulers, of, fourteen, imperial, free, cities, who, issued, a, protest, or, dissent, against, the, edict, of, the, diet, of, speyer, 1529, were, the, first, individuals, to, be, called, protestants, the, edict, reversed, concessions, made, to, the, lutherans, with, the, approval, of, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, three, years, earlier, the, term, protestant, though, initially, purely, political, in, nature, later, acquired, a, broader, sense, referring, to, a, member, of, any, western, church, which, subscribed, to, the, main, protestant, principles, a, protestant, is, an, adherent, of, any, of, those, christian, bodies, that, separated, from, the, church, of, rome, during, the, reformation, or, of, any, group, descended, from, them, during, the, reformation, the, term, protestant, was, hardly, used, outside, of, german, politics, people, who, were, involved, in, the, religious, movement, used, the, word, evangelical, german, evangelisch, for, further, details, see, the, section, below, gradually, protestant, became, a, general, term, meaning, any, adherent, of, the, reformation, in, the, german, speaking, area, it, was, ultimately, somewhat, taken, up, by, lutherans, even, though, martin, luther, himself, insisted, on, christian, or, evangelical, as, the, only, acceptable, names, for, individuals, who, professed, faith, in, christ, french, and, swiss, protestants, instead, preferred, the, word, reformed, french, r, form, which, became, a, popular, neutral, and, alternative, name, for, calvinists, the, word, evangelical, german, evangelisch, which, refers, to, the, gospel, was, widely, used, for, those, involved, in, the, religious, movement, in, the, german, speaking, area, beginning, in, 1517, evangelical, is, still, preferred, among, some, of, the, historical, protestant, denominations, in, the, lutheran, calvinist, and, united, lutheran, and, reformed, protestant, traditions, in, europe, and, those, with, strong, ties, to, them, above, all, the, term, is, used, by, protestant, bodies, in, the, german, speaking, area, such, as, the, protestant, church, in, germany, thus, the, german, word, evangelisch, means, protestant, while, the, german, evangelikal, refers, to, churches, shaped, by, evangelicalism, the, english, word, evangelical, usually, refers, to, evangelical, protestant, churches, and, therefore, to, a, certain, part, of, protestantism, rather, than, to, protestantism, as, a, whole, the, english, word, traces, its, roots, back, to, the, puritans, in, england, where, evangelicalism, originated, and, then, was, brought, to, the, united, states, martin, luther, always, disliked, the, term, lutheran, preferring, the, term, evangelical, which, was, derived, from, euangelion, a, greek, word, meaning, good, news, i, e, gospel, the, followers, of, john, calvin, huldrych, zwingli, and, other, theologians, linked, to, the, reformed, tradition, also, began, to, use, that, term, to, distinguish, the, two, evangelical, groups, others, began, to, refer, to, the, two, groups, as, evangelical, lutheran, and, evangelical, reformed, the, word, also, pertains, in, the, same, way, to, some, other, mainline, groups, for, example, evangelical, methodist, as, time, passed, by, the, word, evangelical, was, dropped, lutherans, themselves, began, to, use, the, term, lutheran, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, in, order, to, distinguish, themselves, from, other, groups, such, as, the, philippists, and, calvinists, the, german, word, reformatorisch, which, roughly, translates, to, english, as, reformational, or, reforming, is, used, as, an, alternative, for, evangelisch, in, german, and, is, different, from, english, reformed, german, reformiert, which, refers, to, churches, shaped, by, ideas, of, john, calvin, huldrych, zwingli, and, other, reformed, theologians, derived, from, the, word, reformation, the, term, emerged, around, the, same, time, as, evangelical, 1517, and, protestant, 1529, various, experts, on, the, subject, tried, to, determine, what, makes, a, christian, denomination, a, part, of, protestantism, a, common, consensus, approved, by, most, of, them, is, that, if, a, christian, denomination, is, to, be, considered, protestant, it, must, acknowledge, the, following, three, fundamental, principles, of, protestantism, the, belief, emphasized, by, luther, in, the, bible, as, the, highest, source, of, authority, for, the, church, the, early, churches, of, the, reformation, believed, in, a, critical, yet, serious, reading, of, scripture, and, holding, the, bible, as, a, source, of, authority, higher, than, that, of, church, tradition, the, many, abuses, that, had, occurred, in, the, western, church, before, the, protestant, reformation, led, the, reformers, to, reject, much, of, its, tradition, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, less, critical, reading, of, the, bible, developed, in, the, united, states, leading, to, a, fundamentalist, reading, of, scripture, christian, fundamentalists, read, the, bible, as, the, inerrant, infallible, word, of, god, as, do, the, catholic, eastern, orthodox, anglican, and, lutheran, churches, but, interpret, it, in, a, literalist, fashion, without, using, the, historical, critical, method, methodists, and, anglicans, differ, from, lutherans, and, the, reformed, on, this, doctrine, as, they, teach, prima, scriptura, which, holds, that, scripture, is, the, primary, source, for, christian, doctrine, but, that, tradition, experience, and, reason, can, nurture, the, christian, religion, as, long, as, they, are, in, harmony, with, the, bible, protestant, canon, biblical, christianity, focused, on, a, deep, study, of, the, bible, is, characteristic, of, most, protestants, as, opposed, to, church, christianity, focused, on, performing, rituals, and, good, works, represented, by, catholic, and, orthodox, traditions, however, quakers, pentecostalists, and, spiritual, christians, emphasize, the, holy, spirit, and, personal, closeness, to, god, the, belief, that, believers, are, justified, or, pardoned, for, sin, solely, on, condition, of, faith, in, christ, rather, than, a, combination, of, faith, and, good, works, for, protestants, good, works, are, a, necessary, consequence, rather, than, cause, of, justification, however, while, justification, is, by, faith, alone, there, is, the, position, that, faith, is, not, nuda, fides, john, calvin, explained, that, it, is, therefore, faith, alone, which, justifies, and, yet, the, faith, which, justifies, is, not, alone, just, as, it, is, the, heat, alone, of, the, sun, which, warms, the, earth, and, yet, in, the, sun, it, is, not, alone, lutheran, and, reformed, christians, differ, from, methodists, in, their, understanding, of, this, doctrine, the, universal, priesthood, of, believers, implies, the, right, and, duty, of, the, christian, laity, not, only, to, read, the, bible, in, the, vernacular, but, also, to, take, part, in, the, government, and, all, the, public, affairs, of, the, church, it, is, opposed, to, the, hierarchical, system, which, puts, the, essence, and, authority, of, the, church, in, an, exclusive, priesthood, and, which, makes, ordained, priests, the, necessary, mediators, between, god, and, the, people, it, is, distinguished, from, the, concept, of, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, which, did, not, grant, individuals, the, right, to, interpret, the, bible, apart, from, the, christian, community, at, large, because, universal, priesthood, opened, the, door, to, such, a, possibility, there, are, scholars, who, cite, that, this, doctrine, tends, to, subsume, all, distinctions, in, the, church, under, a, single, spiritual, entity, calvin, referred, to, the, universal, priesthood, as, an, expression, of, the, relation, between, the, believer, and, his, god, including, the, freedom, of, a, christian, to, come, to, god, through, christ, without, human, mediation, he, also, maintained, that, this, principle, recognizes, christ, as, prophet, priest, and, king, and, that, his, priesthood, is, shared, with, his, people, protestants, who, adhere, to, the, nicene, creed, believe, in, three, persons, god, the, father, god, the, son, and, the, god, the, holy, spirit, as, one, god, movements, that, emerged, around, the, time, of, the, protestant, reformation, but, are, not, a, part, of, protestantism, e, g, unitarianism, reject, the, trinity, this, often, serves, as, a, reason, for, exclusion, of, the, unitarian, universalism, oneness, pentecostalism, and, other, movements, from, protestantism, by, various, observers, unitarianism, continues, to, have, a, presence, mainly, in, transylvania, england, and, the, united, states, the, five, solae, are, five, latin, phrases, or, slogans, that, emerged, during, the, protestant, reformation, and, summarize, the, reformers, basic, differences, in, theological, beliefs, in, opposition, to, the, teaching, of, the, catholic, church, of, the, day, the, latin, word, sola, means, alone, only, or, single, the, use, of, the, phrases, as, summaries, of, teaching, emerged, over, time, during, the, reformation, based, on, the, overarching, lutheran, and, reformed, principle, of, sola, scriptura, by, scripture, alone, this, idea, contains, the, four, main, doctrines, on, the, bible, that, its, teaching, is, needed, for, salvation, necessity, that, all, the, doctrine, necessary, for, salvation, comes, from, the, bible, alone, sufficiency, that, everything, taught, in, the, bible, is, correct, inerrancy, and, that, by, the, holy, spirit, overcoming, sin, believers, may, read, and, understand, truth, from, the, bible, itself, though, understanding, is, difficult, so, the, means, used, to, guide, individual, believers, to, the, true, teaching, is, often, mutual, discussion, within, the, church, clarity, the, necessity, and, inerrancy, were, well, established, ideas, garnering, little, criticism, though, they, later, came, under, debate, from, outside, during, the, enlightenment, the, most, contentious, idea, at, the, time, though, was, the, notion, that, anyone, could, simply, pick, up, the, bible, and, learn, enough, to, gain, salvation, though, the, reformers, were, concerned, with, ecclesiology, the, doctrine, of, how, the, church, as, a, body, works, they, had, a, different, understanding, of, the, process, in, which, truths, in, scripture, were, applied, to, life, of, believers, compared, to, the, catholics, idea, that, certain, people, within, the, church, or, ideas, that, were, old, enough, had, a, special, status, in, giving, understanding, of, the, text, the, second, main, principle, sola, fide, by, faith, alone, states, that, faith, in, christ, is, sufficient, alone, for, eternal, salvation, and, justification, though, argued, from, scripture, and, hence, logically, consequent, to, sola, scriptura, this, is, the, guiding, principle, of, the, work, of, luther, and, the, later, reformers, because, sola, scriptura, placed, the, bible, as, the, only, source, of, teaching, sola, fide, epitomizes, the, main, thrust, of, the, teaching, the, reformers, wanted, to, get, back, to, namely, the, direct, close, personal, connection, between, christ, and, the, believer, hence, the, reformers, contention, that, their, work, was, christocentric, the, other, solas, as, statements, emerged, later, but, the, thinking, they, represent, was, also, part, of, the, early, reformation, the, protestant, movement, began, to, diverge, into, several, distinct, branches, in, the, mid, to, late, 16th, century, one, of, the, central, points, of, divergence, was, controversy, over, the, eucharist, early, protestants, rejected, the, catholic, dogma, of, transubstantiation, which, teaches, that, the, bread, and, wine, used, in, the, sacrificial, rite, of, the, mass, lose, their, natural, substance, by, being, transformed, into, the, body, blood, soul, and, divinity, of, christ, they, disagreed, with, one, another, concerning, the, presence, of, christ, and, his, body, and, blood, in, holy, communion, protestants, reject, the, catholic, doctrine, of, papal, supremacy, and, have, variant, views, on, the, number, of, sacraments, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, and, matters, of, ecclesiastical, polity, and, apostolic, succession, many, of, the, individual, ideas, that, were, taken, up, by, various, reformers, had, historical, pre, cursors, however, calling, them, proto, reformers, is, controversial, as, often, their, theology, also, had, components, that, are, not, associated, with, later, protestants, or, that, were, asserted, by, some, protestants, but, denied, by, others, or, that, were, only, superficially, similar, one, of, the, earliest, persons, to, be, praised, as, a, protestant, forerunner, is, jovinian, who, lived, in, the, fourth, century, ad, he, attacked, monasticism, ascetism, and, believed, that, a, saved, believer, can, never, be, overcome, by, satan, in, the, 9th, century, the, theologian, gottschalk, of, orbais, was, condemned, for, heresy, by, the, catholic, church, gottschalk, believed, that, the, salvation, of, jesus, was, limited, and, that, his, redemption, was, only, for, the, elect, the, theology, of, gottschalk, anticipated, the, protestant, reformation, ratramnus, also, defended, the, theology, of, gottschalk, and, denied, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, his, writings, also, influenced, the, later, protestant, reformation, claudius, of, turin, in, the, 9th, century, also, held, protestant, ideas, such, as, faith, alone, and, rejection, of, the, supremacy, of, peter, in, the, late, 1130s, arnold, of, brescia, an, italian, canon, regular, became, one, of, the, first, theologians, to, attempt, to, reform, the, catholic, church, after, his, death, his, teachings, on, apostolic, poverty, gained, currency, among, arnoldists, and, later, more, widely, among, waldensians, and, the, spiritual, franciscans, though, no, written, word, of, his, has, survived, the, official, condemnation, in, the, early, 1170s, peter, waldo, founded, the, waldensians, he, advocated, an, interpretation, of, the, gospel, that, led, to, conflicts, with, the, catholic, church, by, 1215, the, waldensians, were, declared, heretical, and, subject, to, persecution, despite, that, the, movement, continues, to, exist, to, this, day, in, italy, as, a, part, of, the, wider, reformed, tradition, in, the, 1370s, oxford, theologian, and, priest, john, wycliffe, later, dubbed, the, morning, star, of, reformation, started, his, activity, as, an, english, reformer, he, rejected, papal, authority, over, secular, power, in, that, any, person, in, mortal, sin, lost, their, authority, and, should, be, resisted, a, priest, with, possessions, such, as, a, pope, was, in, such, grave, sin, may, have, translated, the, bible, into, vernacular, english, and, preached, anticlerical, and, biblically, centred, reforms, his, rejection, of, a, real, divine, presence, in, the, elements, of, the, eucharist, foreshadowed, huldrych, zwingli, s, similar, ideas, in, the, 16th, century, wycliffe, s, admirers, came, to, be, known, as, lollards, beginning, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 15th, century, jan, hus, a, catholic, priest, czech, reformist, and, professor, influenced, by, john, wycliffe, s, writings, founded, the, hussite, movement, he, strongly, advocated, his, reformist, bohemian, religious, denomination, he, was, excommunicated, and, burned, at, the, stake, in, constance, bishopric, of, constance, in, 1415, by, secular, authorities, for, unrepentant, and, persistent, heresy, after, his, execution, a, revolt, erupted, hussites, defeated, five, continuous, crusades, proclaimed, against, them, by, the, pope, later, theological, disputes, caused, a, split, within, the, hussite, movement, utraquists, maintained, that, both, the, bread, and, the, wine, should, be, administered, to, the, people, during, the, eucharist, another, major, faction, were, the, taborites, who, opposed, the, utraquists, in, the, battle, of, lipany, during, the, hussite, wars, there, were, two, separate, parties, among, the, hussites, moderate, and, radical, movements, other, smaller, regional, hussite, branches, in, bohemia, included, adamites, orebites, orphans, and, praguers, the, hussite, wars, concluded, with, the, victory, of, holy, roman, emperor, sigismund, his, catholic, allies, and, moderate, hussites, and, the, defeat, of, the, radical, hussites, tensions, arose, as, the, thirty, years, war, reached, bohemia, in, 1620, both, moderate, and, radical, hussitism, was, increasingly, persecuted, by, catholics, and, holy, roman, emperor, s, armies, in, the, 14th, century, a, german, mysticist, group, called, the, gottesfreunde, criticized, the, catholic, church, and, its, corruption, many, of, their, leaders, were, executed, for, attacking, the, catholic, church, and, they, believed, that, god, s, judgement, would, soon, come, upon, the, church, the, gottesfreunde, were, a, democratic, lay, movement, and, forerunner, of, the, reformation, and, put, heavy, stress, of, holiness, and, piety, starting, in, 1475, an, italian, dominican, friar, girolamo, savonarola, was, calling, for, a, christian, renewal, later, on, martin, luther, himself, read, some, of, the, friar, s, writings, and, praised, him, as, a, martyr, and, forerunner, whose, ideas, on, faith, and, grace, anticipated, luther, s, own, doctrine, of, justification, by, faith, alone, some, of, hus, followers, founded, the, unitas, fratrum, unity, of, the, brethren, which, was, renewed, under, the, leadership, of, count, nicolaus, von, zinzendorf, in, herrnhut, saxony, in, 1722, after, its, almost, total, destruction, in, the, thirty, years, war, and, the, counterreformation, catholic, reformation, today, it, is, usually, referred, to, in, english, as, the, moravian, church, and, in, german, as, the, herrnhuter, br, dergemeine, in, the, 15th, century, three, german, theologians, anticipated, the, reformation, wessel, gansfort, johann, ruchat, von, wesel, and, johannes, von, goch, they, held, ideas, such, as, predestination, sola, scriptura, and, the, church, invisible, and, denied, the, roman, catholic, view, on, justification, and, the, authority, of, the, pope, also, questioning, monasticism, wessel,

liturgies, hymnals, monuments, calendrical, commemoration, the, protestant, reformation, began, as, an, attempt, to, reform, the, catholic, church, on, 31, october, 1517, known, as, all, hallows, eve, martin, luther, allegedly, nailed, his, ninety, five, theses, also, known, as, the, disputation, on, the, power, of, indulgences, on, the, door, of, the, all, saints, church, in, wittenberg, germany, detailing, doctrinal, and, practical, abuses, of, the, catholic, church, especially, the, selling, of, indulgences, the, theses, debated, and, criticized, many, aspects, of, the, church, and, the, papacy, including, the, practice, of, purgatory, particular, judgment, and, the, authority, of, the, pope, luther, would, later, write, works, against, the, catholic, devotion, to, virgin, mary, the, intercession, of, and, devotion, to, the, saints, mandatory, clerical, celibacy, monasticism, the, authority, of, the, pope, the, ecclesiastical, law, censure, and, excommunication, the, role, of, secular, rulers, in, religious, matters, the, relationship, between, christianity, and, the, law, good, works, and, the, sacraments, the, reformation, was, a, triumph, of, literacy, and, the, new, printing, press, invented, by, johannes, gutenberg, luther, s, translation, of, the, bible, into, german, was, a, decisive, moment, in, the, spread, of, literacy, and, stimulated, as, well, the, printing, and, distribution, of, religious, books, and, pamphlets, from, 1517, onward, religious, pamphlets, flooded, much, of, europe, following, the, excommunication, of, luther, and, condemnation, of, the, reformation, by, the, pope, the, work, and, writings, of, john, calvin, were, influential, in, establishing, a, loose, consensus, among, various, groups, in, switzerland, scotland, hungary, germany, and, elsewhere, after, the, expulsion, of, its, bishop, in, 1526, and, the, unsuccessful, attempts, of, the, bern, reformer, william, farel, calvin, was, asked, to, use, the, organizational, skill, he, had, gathered, as, a, student, of, law, to, discipline, the, city, of, geneva, his, ordinances, of, 1541, involved, a, collaboration, of, church, affairs, with, the, city, council, and, consistory, to, bring, morality, to, all, areas, of, life, after, the, establishment, of, the, geneva, academy, in, 1559, geneva, became, the, unofficial, capital, of, the, protestant, movement, providing, refuge, for, protestant, exiles, from, all, over, europe, and, educating, them, as, calvinist, missionaries, the, faith, continued, to, spread, after, calvin, s, death, in, 1563, protestantism, also, spread, from, the, german, lands, into, france, where, the, protestants, were, nicknamed, huguenots, a, term, of, somewhat, inexplicable, origin, calvin, continued, to, take, an, interest, in, the, french, religious, affairs, from, his, base, in, geneva, he, regularly, trained, pastors, to, lead, congregations, there, despite, heavy, persecution, the, reformed, tradition, made, steady, progress, across, large, sections, of, the, nation, appealing, to, people, alienated, by, the, obduracy, and, the, complacency, of, the, catholic, establishment, french, protestantism, came, to, acquire, a, distinctly, political, character, made, all, the, more, obvious, by, the, conversions, of, nobles, during, the, 1550s, this, established, the, preconditions, for, a, series, of, conflicts, known, as, the, french, wars, of, religion, the, civil, wars, gained, impetus, with, the, sudden, death, of, henry, ii, of, france, in, 1559, atrocity, and, outrage, became, the, defining, characteristics, of, the, time, illustrated, at, their, most, intense, in, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, of, august, 1572, when, the, catholic, party, annihilated, between, 30, 000, and, 100, 000, huguenots, across, france, the, wars, only, concluded, when, henry, iv, of, france, issued, the, edict, of, nantes, promising, official, toleration, of, the, protestant, minority, but, under, highly, restricted, conditions, catholicism, remained, the, official, state, religion, and, the, fortunes, of, french, protestants, gradually, declined, over, the, next, century, culminating,

frederick, william, i, elector, of, brandenburg, declared, the, edict, of, potsdam, giving, free, passage, to, huguenot, refugees, in, the, late, 17th, century, many, huguenots, fled, to, england, the, netherlands, prussia, switzerland, and, the, english, and, dutch, overseas, colonies, a, significant, community, in, france, remained, in, the, c, vennes, region, parallel, to, events, in, germany, a, movement, began, in, switzerland, under, the, leadership, of, huldrych, zwingli, zwingli, was, a, scholar, and, preacher, who, in, 1518, moved, to, zurich, although, the, two, movements, agreed, on, many, issues, of, theology, some, unresolved, differences, kept, them, separate, a, long, standing, resentment, between, the, german, states, and, the, swiss, confederation, led, to, heated, debate, over, how, much, zwingli, owed, his, ideas, to, lutheranism, the, german, prince, philip, of, hesse, saw, potential, in, creating, an, alliance, between, zwingli, and, luther, a, meeting, was, held, in, his, castle, in, 1529, now, known, as, the, colloquy, of, marburg, which, has, become, infamous, for, its, failure, the, two, men, could, not, come, to, any, agreement, due, to, their, disputation, over, one, key, doctrine, in, 1534, king, henry, viii, put, an, end, to, all, papal, jurisdiction, in, england, after, the, pope, failed, to, annul, his, marriage, to, catherine, of, aragon, due, to, political, considerations, involving, the, holy, roman, emperor, this, opened, the, door, to, reformational, ideas, reformers, in, the, church, of, england, alternated, between, sympathies, for, ancient, catholic, tradition, and, more, reformed, principles, gradually, developing, into, a, tradition, considered, a, middle, way, via, media, between, the, catholic, and, protestant, traditions, the, english, reformation, followed, a, particular, course, the, different, character, of, the, english, reformation, came, primarily, from, the, fact, that, it, was, driven, initially, by, the, political, necessities, of, henry, viii, king, henry, decided, to, remove, the, church, of, england, from, the, authority, of, rome, in, 1534, the, act, of, supremacy, recognized, henry, as, the, only, supreme, head, on, earth, of, the, church, of, england, between, 1535, and, 1540, under, thomas, cromwell, the, policy, known, as, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, was, put, into, effect, following, a, brief, catholic, restoration, during, the, reign, of, mary, i, a, loose, consensus, developed, during, the, reign, of, elizabeth, i, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, largely, formed, anglicanism, into, a, distinctive, church, tradition, the, compromise, was, uneasy, and, was, capable, of, veering, between, extreme, calvinism, on, the, one, hand, and, catholicism, on, the, other, it, was, relatively, successful, until, the, puritan, revolution, or, english, civil, war, in, the, 17th, century, the, success, of, the, counterreformation, catholic, reformation, on, the, continent, and, the, growth, of, a, puritan, party, dedicated, to, further, protestant, reform, polarized, the, elizabethan, age, the, early, puritan, movement, was, a, movement, for, reform, in, the, church, of, england, whose, proponents, desired, for, the, church, of, england, to, resemble, more, closely, the, protestant, churches, of, europe, especially, that, of, geneva, the, later, puritan, movement, often, referred, to, as, dissenters, and, nonconformists, eventually, led, to, the, formation, of, various, reformed, denominations, the, scottish, reformation, of, 1560, decisively, shaped, the, church, of, scotland, the, reformation, in, scotland, culminated, ecclesiastically, in, the, establishment, of, a, church, along, reformed, lines, and, politically, in, the, triumph, of, english, influence, over, that, of, france, john, knox, is, regarded, as, the, leader, of, the, scottish, reformation, the, scottish, reformation, parliament, of, 1560, repudiated, the, pope, s, authority, by, the, papal, jurisdiction, act, 1560, forbade, the, celebration, of, the, mass, and, approved, a, protestant, confession, of, faith, it, was, made, possible, by, a, revolution, against, french, hegemony, under, the, regime, of, the, regent, mary, of, guise, who, had, governed, scotland, in, the, name, of, her, absent, daughter, some, of, the, most, important, activists, of, the, protestant, reformation, included, jacobus, arminius, theodore, beza, martin, bucer, andreas, von, carlstadt, heinrich, bullinger, balthasar, hubmaier, thomas, cranmer, william, farel, thomas, m, ntzer, laurentius, petri, olaus, petri, philipp, melanchthon, menno, simons, louis, de, berquin, primo, trubar, and, john, smyth, in, the, course, of, this, religious, upheaval, the, german, peasants, war, of, 1524, 25, swept, through, the, bavarian, thuringian, and, swabian, principalities, after, the, eighty, years, war, in, the, low, countries, and, the, french, wars, of, religion, the, confessional, division, of, the, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, eventually, erupted, in, the, thirty, years, war, between, 1618, and, 1648, it, devastated, much, of, germany, killing, between, 25, and, 40, of, its, population, the, main, tenets, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, which, ended, the, thirty, years, war, were, the, great, awakenings, were, periods, of, rapid, and, dramatic, religious, revival, in, anglo, american, religious, history, the, first, great, awakening, was, an, evangelical, and, revitalization, movement, that, swept, through, protestant, europe, and, british, america, especially, the, american, colonies, in, the, 1730s, and, 1740s, leaving, a, permanent, impact, on, american, protestantism, it, resulted, from, powerful, preaching, that, gave, listeners, a, sense, of, deep, personal, revelation, of, their, need, of, salvation, by, jesus, christ, pulling, away, from, ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism, and, hierarchy, it, made, christianity, intensely, personal, to, the, average, person, by, fostering, a, deep, sense, of, spiritual, conviction, and, redemption, and, by, encouraging, introspection, and, a, commitment, to, a, new, standard, of, personal, morality, the, second, great, awakening, began, around, 1790, it, gained, momentum, by, 1800, after, 1820, membership, rose, rapidly, among, baptist, and, methodist, congregations, whose, preachers, led, the, movement, it, was, past, its, peak, by, the, late, 1840s, it, has, been, described, as, a, reaction, against, skepticism, deism, and, rationalism, although, why, those, forces, became, pressing, enough, at, the, time, to, spark, revivals, is, not, fully, understood, it, enrolled, millions, of, new, members, in, existing, evangelical, denominations, and, led, to, the, formation, of, new, denominations, the, third, great, awakening, refers, to, a, hypothetical, historical, period, that, was, marked, by, religious, activism, in, american, history, and, spans, the, late, 1850s, to, the, early, 20th, century, it, affected, pietistic, protestant, denominations, and, had, a, strong, element, of, social, activism, it, gathered, strength, from, the, postmillennial, belief, that, the, second, coming, of, christ, would, occur, after, mankind, had, reformed, the, entire, earth, it, was, affiliated, with, the, social, gospel, movement, which, applied, christianity, to, social, issues, and, gained, its, force, from, the, awakening, as, did, the, worldwide, missionary, movement, new, groupings, emerged, such, as, the, holiness, nazarene, and, christian, science, movements, the, fourth, great, awakening, was, a, christian, religious, awakening, that, some, scholars, most, notably, robert, fogel, say, took, place, in, the, united, states, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, while, others, look, at, the, era, following, world, war, ii, the, terminology, is, controversial, thus, the, idea, of, a, fourth, great, awakening, itself, has, not, been, generally, accepted, in, 1814, le, r, veil, swept, through, calvinist, regions, in, switzerland, and, france, in, 1904, a, protestant, revival, in, wales, had, a, tremendous, impact, on, the, local, population, a, part, of, british, modernization, it, drew, many, people, to, churches, especially, methodist, and, baptist, ones, a, noteworthy, development, in, 20th, century, protestant, christianity, was, the, rise, of, the, modern, pentecostal, movement, sprung, from, methodist, and, wesleyan, roots, it, arose, out, of, meetings, at, an, urban, mission, on, azusa, street, in, los, angeles, from, there, it, spread, around, the, world, carried, by, those, who, experienced, what, they, believed, to, be, miraculous, moves, of, god, there, these, pentecost, like, manifestations, have, steadily, been, in, evidence, throughout, history, such, as, seen, in, the, two, great, awakenings, pentecostalism, which, in, turn, birthed, the, charismatic, movement, within, already, established, denominations, continues, to, be, an, important, force, in, western, christianity, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, in, the, world, there, has, been, a, marked, rise, in, the, evangelical, wing, of, protestant, denominations, especially, those, that, are, more, exclusively, evangelical, and, a, corresponding, decline, in, the, mainstream, liberal, churches, in, the, post, world, war, i, era, liberal, christianity, was, on, the, rise, and, a, considerable, number, of, seminaries, held, and, taught, from, a, liberal, perspective, as, well, in, the, post, world, war, ii, era, the, trend, began, to, swing, back, towards, the, conservative, camp, in, america, s, seminaries, and, church, structures, in, europe, there, has, been, a, general, move, away, from, religious, observance, and, belief, in, christian, teachings, and, a, move, towards, secularism, the, enlightenment, is, largely, responsible, for, the, spread, of, secularism, some, scholars, debate, the, link, between, protestantism, and, the, rise, of, secularism, and, take, as, argument, the, wide, ranging, freedom, in, protestant, majority, countries, however, the, sole, example, of, france, demonstrates, that, even, in, catholic, majority, countries, the, overwhelming, impact, of, the, enlightenment, has, brought, even, stronger, secularism, and, freedom, of, thought, five, centuries, later, it, is, more, reliable, to, consider, that, the, reformation, influenced, the, critical, thinkers, of, the, subsequent, centuries, providing, intellectual, religious, and, philosophical, ground, on, which, future, philosophers, could, extend, their, criticism, of, the, church, of, its, theological, philosophical, social, assumptions, of, the, time, one, should, be, reminded, though, that, initial, philosophers, of, the, enlightenment, were, defending, a, christian, conception, of, the, world, but, it, was, developed, together, with, a, fierce, and, decisive, criticism, of, the, church, its, politics, its, ethics, its, worldview, its, scientific, and, cultural, assumptions, leading, to, the, devaluation, of, all, forms, of, institutionalized, christianity, which, extended, over, the, centuries, unlike, mainstream, lutheran, calvinist, and, zwinglian, movements, the, radical, reformation, which, had, no, state, sponsorship, generally, abandoned, the, idea, of, the, church, visible, as, distinct, from, the, church, invisible, it, was, a, rational, extension, of, the, state, approved, protestant, dissent, which, took, the, value, of, independence, from, constituted, authority, a, step, further, arguing, the, same, for, the, civic, realm, the, radical, reformation, was, non, mainstream, though, in, parts, of, germany, switzerland, and, austria, a, majority, would, sympathize, with, the, radical, reformation, despite, the, intense, persecution, it, faced, from, both, catholics, and, magisterial, protestants, the, early, anabaptists, believed, that, their, reformation, must, purify, not, only, theology, but, also, the, actual, lives, of, christians, especially, their, political, and, social, relationships, therefore, the, church, should, not, be, supported, by, the, state, neither, by, tithes, and, taxes, nor, by, the, use, of, the, sword, christianity, was, a, matter, of, individual, conviction, which, could, not, be, forced, on, anyone, but, rather, required, a, personal, decision, for, it, protestant, ecclesial, leaders, such, as, hubmaier, and, hofmann, preached, the, invalidity, of, infant, baptism, advocating, baptism, as, following, conversion, believer, s, baptism, instead, this, was, not, a, doctrine, new, to, the, reformers, but, was, taught, by, earlier, groups, such, as, the, albigenses, in, 1147, though, most, of, the, radical, reformers, were, anabaptist, some, did, not, identify, themselves, with, the, mainstream, anabaptist, tradition, thomas, m, ntzer, was, involved, in, the, german, peasants, war, andreas, karlstadt, disagreed, theologically, with, huldrych, zwingli, and, martin, luther, teaching, nonviolence, and, refusing, to, baptize, infants, while, not, rebaptizing, adult, believers, kaspar, schwenkfeld, and, sebastian, franck, were, influenced, by, german, mysticism, and, spiritualism, in, the, view, of, many, associated, with, the, radical, reformation, the, magisterial, reformation, had, not, gone, far, enough, radical, reformer, andreas, von, bodenstein, karlstadt, for, example, referred, to, the, lutheran, theologians, at, wittenberg, as, the, new, papists, since, the, term, magister, also, means, teacher, the, magisterial, reformation, is, also, characterized, by, an, emphasis, on, the, authority, of, a, teacher, this, is, made, evident, in, the, prominence, of, luther, calvin, and, zwingli, as, leaders, of, the, reform, movements, in, their, respective, areas, of, ministry, because, of, their, authority, they, were, often, criticized, by, radical, reformers, as, being, too, much, like, the, roman, popes, a, more, political, side, of, the, radical, reformation, can, be, seen, in, the, thought, and, practice, of, hans, hut, although, typically, anabaptism, has, been, associated, with, pacifism, anabaptism, in, shape, of, its, various, diversification, such, as, the, amish, mennonites, and, hutterites, came, out, of, the, radical, reformation, later, in, history, schwarzenau, brethren, and, the, apostolic, christian, church, would, emerge, in, anabaptist, circles, protestants, refer, to, specific, groupings, of, congregations, or, churches, that, share, in, common, foundational, doctrines, and, the, name, of, their, groups, as, denominations, the, term, denomination, national, body, is, to, be, distinguished, from, branch, denominational, family, tradition, communion, international, body, and, congregation, church, an, example, this, is, no, universal, way, to, classify, protestant, churches, as, these, may, sometimes, vary, broadly, in, their, structures, to, show, the, difference, protestants, reject, the, catholic, church, s, doctrine, that, it, is, the, one, true, church, with, some, teaching, belief, in, the, invisible, church, which, consists, of, all, who, profess, faith, in, jesus, christ, the, lutheran, church, traditionally, sees, itself, as, the, main, trunk, of, the, historical, christian, tree, founded, by, christ, and, the, apostles, holding, that, during, the, reformation, the, church, of, rome, fell, away, individual, denominations, also, have, formed, over, very, subtle, theological, differences, other, denominations, are, simply, regional, or, ethnic, expressions, of, the, same, beliefs, because, the, five, solas, are, the, main, tenets, of, the, protestant, faith, non, denominational, groups, and, organizations, are, also, considered, protestant, various, ecumenical, movements, have, attempted, cooperation, or, reorganization, of, the, various, divided, protestant, denominations, according, to, various, models, of, union, but, divisions, continue, to, outpace, unions, as, there, is, no, overarching, authority, to, which, any, of, the, churches, owe, allegiance, which, can, authoritatively, define, the, faith, most, denominations, share, common, beliefs, in, the, major, aspects, of, the, christian, faith, while, differing, in, many, secondary, doctrines, although, what, is, major, and, what, is, secondary, is, a, matter, of, idiosyncratic, belief, several, countries, have, established, their, national, churches, linking, the, ecclesiastical, structure, with, the, state, jurisdictions, where, a, protestant, denomination, has, been, established, as, a, state, religion, include, several, nordic, countries, denmark, including, greenland, the, faroe, islands, its, church, being, independent, since, 2007, iceland, and, norway, have, established, evangelical, lutheran, churches, tuvalu, has, the, only, established, church, in, reformed, tradition, in, the, world, while, tonga, in, the, methodist, tradition, the, church, of, england, is, the, officially, established, religious, institution, in, england, and, also, the, mother, church, of, the, worldwide, anglican, communion, in, 1869, finland, was, the, first, nordic, country, to, disestablish, its, evangelical, lutheran, church, by, introducing, the, church, act, although, the, church, still, maintains, a, special, relationship, with, the, state, it, is, not, described, as, a, state, religion, in, the, finnish, constitution, or, other, laws, passed, by, the, finnish, parliament, in, 2000, sweden, was, the, second, nordic, country, to, do, so, united, and, uniting, churches, are, churches, formed, from, the, merger, or, other, form, of, union, of, two, or, more, different, protestant, denominations, historically, unions, of, protestant, churches, were, enforced, by, the, state, usually, in, order, to, have, a, stricter, control, over, the, religious, sphere, of, its, people, but, also, for, other, organizational, reasons, as, modern, christian, ecumenism, progresses, unions, between, various, protestant, traditions, are, becoming, more, and, more, common, resulting, in, a, growing, number, of, united, and, uniting, churches, some, of, the, recent, major, examples, are, the, church, of, north, india, 1970, united, protestant, church, of, france, 2013, and, the, protestant, church, in, the, netherlands, 2004, as, mainline, protestantism, shrinks, in, europe, and, north, america, due, to, the, rise, of, secularism, or, in, areas, where, christianity, is, a, minority, religion, as, with, the, indian, subcontinent, reformed, anglican, and, lutheran, denominations, merge, often, creating, large, nationwide, denominations, the, phenomenon, is, much, less, common, among, evangelical, nondenominational, and, charismatic, churches, as, new, ones, arise, and, plenty, of, them, remain, independent, of, each, other, what, is, perhaps, the, oldest, official, united, church, is, found, in, germany, where, the, protestant, church, in, germany, is, a, federation, of, lutheran, united, prussian, union, and, reformed, churches, a, union, dating, back, to, 1817, the, first, of, the, series, of, unions, was, at, a, synod, in, idstein, to, form, the, protestant, church, in, hesse, and, nassau, in, august, 1817, commemorated, in, naming, the, church, of, idstein, unionskirche, one, hundred, years, later, around, the, world, each, united, or, uniting, church, comprises, a, different, mix, of, predecessor, protestant, denominations, trends, are, visible, however, as, most, united, and, uniting, churches, have, one, or, more, predecessors, with, heritage, in, the, reformed, tradition, and, many, are, members, of, the, world, alliance, of, reformed, churches, protestants, can, be, differentiated, according, to, how, they, have, been, influenced, by, important, movements, since, the, reformation, today, regarded, as, branches, some, of, these, movements, have, a, common, lineage, sometimes, directly, spawning, individual, denominations, due, to, the, earlier, stated, multitude, of, denominations, this, section, discusses, only, the, largest, denominational, families, or, branches, widely, considered, to, be, a, part, of, protestantism, these, are, in, alphabetical, order, adventist, anglican, baptist, calvinist, reformed, hussite, lutheran, methodist, pentecostal, plymouth, brethren, and, quaker, a, small, but, historically, significant, anabaptist, branch, is, also, discussed, the, chart, below, shows, the, mutual, relations, and, historical, origins, of, the, main, protestant, denominational, families, or, their, parts, due, to, factors, such, as, counterreformation, catholic, reformation, and, the, legal, principle, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, many, people, lived, as, nicodemites, where, their, professed, religious, affiliations, were, more, or, less, at, odds, with, the, movement, they, sympathized, with, as, a, result, the, boundaries, between, the, denominations, do, not, separate, as, cleanly, as, this, chart, indicates, when, a, population, was, suppressed, or, persecuted, into, feigning, an, adherence, to, the, dominant, faith, over, the, generations, they, continued, to, influence, the, church, they, outwardly, adhered, to, because, calvinism, was, not, specifically, recognized, in, the, holy, roman, empire, until, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, many, calvinists, lived, as, crypto, calvinists, due, to, counterreformation, catholic, reformation, related, suppressions, in, catholic, lands, during, the, 16th, through, 19th, centuries, many, protestants, lived, as, crypto, protestants, meanwhile, in, protestant, areas, catholics, sometimes, lived, as, crypto, papists, although, in, continental, europe, emigration, was, more, feasible, so, this, was, less, common, adventism, began, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, context, of, the, second, great, awakening, revival, in, the, united, states, the, name, refers, to, belief, in, the, imminent, second, coming, or, second, advent, of, jesus, christ, william, miller, started, the, adventist, movement, in, the, 1830s, his, followers, became, known, as, millerites, although, the, adventist, churches, hold, much, in, common, their, theologies, differ, on, whether, the, intermediate, state, is, unconscious, sleep, or, consciousness, whether, the, ultimate, punishment, of, the, wicked, is, annihilation, or, eternal, torment, the, nature, of, immortality, whether, or, not, the, wicked, are, resurrected, after, the, millennium, and, whether, the, sanctuary, of, daniel, 8, refers, to, the, one, in, heaven, or, one, on, earth, the, movement, has, encouraged, the, examination, of, the, whole, bible, leading, seventh, day, adventists, and, some, smaller, adventist, groups, to, observe, the, sabbath, the, general, conference, of, seventh, day, adventists, has, compiled, that, church, s, core, beliefs, in, the, 28, fundamental, beliefs, 1980, and, 2005, which, use, biblical, references, as, justification, in, 2010, adventism, claimed, some, 22, million, believers, scattered, in, various, independent, churches, the, largest, church, within, the, movement, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, has, more, than, 18, million, members, anabaptism, traces, its, origins, to, the, radical, reformation, anabaptists, believe, in, delaying, baptism, until, the, candidate, confesses, his, or, her, faith, although, some, consider, this, movement, to, be, an, offshoot, of, protestantism, others, see, it, as, a, distinct, one, the, amish, hutterites, and, mennonites, are, direct, descendants, of, the, movement, schwarzenau, brethren, bruderhof, and, the, apostolic, christian, church, are, considered, later, developments, among, the, anabaptists, the, name, anabaptist, meaning, one, who, baptizes, again, was, given, to, them, by, their, persecutors, in, reference, to, the, practice, of, re, baptizing, converts, who, already, had, been, baptized, as, infants, anabaptists, required, that, baptismal, candidates, be, able, to, make, their, own, confessions, of, faith, and, so, rejected, baptism, of, infants, the, early, members, of, this, movement, did, not, accept, the, name, anabaptist, claiming, that, since, infant, baptism, was, unscriptural, and, null, and, void, the, baptizing, of, believers, was, not, a, re, baptism, but, in, fact, their, first, real, baptism, as, a, result, of, their, views, on, the, nature, of, baptism, and, other, issues, anabaptists, were, heavily, persecuted, during, the, 16th, century, and, into, the, 17th, by, both, magisterial, protestants, and, catholics, while, most, anabaptists, adhered, to, a, literal, interpretation, of, the, sermon, on, the, mount, which, precluded, taking, oaths, participating, in, military, actions, and, participating, in, civil, government, some, who, practiced, re, baptism, felt, otherwise, they, were, thus, technically, anabaptists, even, though, conservative, amish, mennonites, and, hutterites, and, some, historians, tend, to, consider, them, as, outside, of, true, anabaptism, anabaptist, reformers, of, the, radical, reformation, are, divided, into, radical, and, the, so, called, second, front, some, important, radical, reformation, theologians, were, john, of, leiden, thomas, m, ntzer, kaspar, schwenkfeld, sebastian, franck, menno, simons, second, front, reformers, included, hans, denck, conrad, grebel, balthasar, hubmaier, and, felix, manz, many, anabaptists, today, still, use, the, ausbund, which, is, the, oldest, hymnal, still, in, continuous, use, anglicanism, consists, of, the, church, of, england, and, churches, which, are, historically, tied, to, it, or, hold, similar, beliefs, worship, practices, and, church, structures, the, word, anglican, originates, in, ecclesia, anglicana, a, medieval, latin, phrase, dating, to, at, least, 1246, that, means, the, english, church, there, is, no, single, anglican, church, with, universal, juridical, authority, since, each, national, or, regional, church, has, full, autonomy, as, the, name, suggests, the, communion, is, an, association, of, churches, in, full, communion, with, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, the, great, majority, of, anglicans, are, members, of, churches, which, are, part, of, the, international, anglican, communion, which, has, 85, million, adherents, the, church, of, england, declared, its, independence, from, the, catholic, church, at, the, time, of, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, many, of, the, new, anglican, formularies, of, the, mid, 16th, century, corresponded, closely, to, those, of, contemporary, reformed, tradition, these, reforms,

identical, with, methodism, the, two, systems, of, calvinism, and, arminianism, share, both, history, and, many, doctrines, and, the, history, of, christian, theology, however, because, of, their, differences, over, the, doctrines, of, divine, predestination, and, election, many, people, view, these, schools, of, thought, as, opposed, to, each, other, in, short, the, difference, can, be, seen, ultimately, by, whether, god, allows, his, desire, to, save, all, to, be, resisted, by, an, individual, s, will, in, the, arminian, doctrine, or, if, god, s, grace, is, irresistible, and, limited, to, only, some, in, calvinism, some, calvinists, assert, that, the, arminian, perspective, presents, a, synergistic, system, of, salvation, and, therefore, is, not, only, by, grace, while, arminians,

the, puritan, movement, and, the, two, are, often, confused, there, are, important, differences, particularly, in, the, concept, of, the, role, of, religion, in, government, the, puritans, were, a, group, of, english, protestants, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, which, sought, to, purify, the, church, of, england, of, what, they, considered, to, be, catholic, practices, maintaining, that,

churches, of, his, day, for, dead, orthodoxy, neo, orthodoxy, is, associated, primarily, with, karl, barth, j, rgen, moltmann, and, dietrich, bonhoeffer, neo, orthodoxy, sought, to, counter, act, the, tendency, of, liberal, theology, to, make, theological, accommodations, to, modern, scientific, perspectives, sometimes, called, crisis, theology, in, the, existentialist, sense, of, the, word, crisis, also, sometimes, called, neo, evangelicalism, which, uses, the, sense, of, evangelical, pertaining, to, continental, european, protestants, rather, than, american, evangelicalism, evangelical, was, the, originally, preferred, label, used, by, lutherans, and, calvinists, but, it, was, replaced, by, the, names, some, catholics, used, to, label, a, heresy, with, the, name, of, its, founder, paleo, orthodoxy, is, a, movement, similar, in, some, respects, to, neo, evangelicalism, but, emphasizing, the, ancient, christian, consensus, of, the, undivided, church, of, the, first, millennium, ad, including, in, particular, the, early, creeds, and, church, councils, as, a, means, of, properly, understanding, the, scriptures, this, movement, is, cross, denominational, a, prominent, theologian, in, this, group, is, thomas, oden, a, methodist, in, reaction, to, liberal, bible, critique, fundamentalism, arose, in, the, 20th, century, primarily, in, the, united, states, among, those, denominations, most, affected, by, evangelicalism, fundamentalist, theology, tends, to, stress, biblical, inerrancy, and, biblical, literalism, toward, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, some, have, tended, to, confuse, evangelicalism, and, fundamentalism, however, the, labels, represent, very, distinct, differences, of, approach, that, both, groups, are, diligent, to, maintain, although, because, of, fundamentalism, s, dramatically, smaller, size, it, often, gets, classified, simply, as, an, ultra, conservative, branch, of, evangelicalism, modernism, and, liberalism, do, not, constitute, rigorous, and, well, defined, schools, of, theology, but, are, rather, an, inclination, by, some, writers, and, teachers, to, integrate, christian, thought, into, the, spirit, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, new, understandings, of, history, and, the, natural, sciences, of, the, day, led, directly, to, new, approaches, to, theology, its, opposition, to, the, fundamentalist, teaching, resulted, in, religious, debates, such, as, the, fundamentalist, modernist, controversy, within, the, presbyterian, church, in, the, united, states, of, america, in, the, 1920s, although, the, reformation, was, a, religious, movement, it, also, had, a, strong, impact, on, all, other, aspects, of, life, including, marriage, and, family, education, the, humanities, and, sciences, the, political, and, social, order, the, economy, and, the, arts, protestant, churches, reject, the, idea, of, a, celibate, priesthood, and, thus, allow, their, clergy, to, marry, many, of, their, families, contributed, to, the, development, of, intellectual, elites, in, their, countries, since, about, 1950, women, have, entered, the, ministry, in, most, protestant, churches, and, some, have, assumed, leading, positions, e, g, bishops, protestantism, has, promoted, economic, growth, and, entrepreneurship, especially, in, the, period, after, the, scientific, and, the, industrial, revolution, scholars, have, identified, a, positive, correlation, between, the, rise, of, protestantism, and, human, capital, formation, work, ethic, economic, development, the, rise, of, early, experimental, science, and, the, development, of, the, state, system, as, the, reformers, wanted, all, members, of, the, church, to, be, able, to, read, the, bible, education, on, all, levels, was, strongly, encouraged, by, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, century, the, literacy, rate, in, england, was, about, 60, percent, in, scotland, 65, percent, and, in, sweden, 80, percent, colleges, and, universities, were, founded, for, example, the, puritans, who, established, massachusetts, bay, colony, in, 1628, founded, harvard, college, only, eight, years, later, about, a, dozen, other, colleges, followed, in, the, 18th, century, including, yale, 1701, pennsylvania, also, became, a, center, of, learning, members, of, mainline, protestant, denominations, have, played, leadership, roles, in, many, aspects, of, american, life, including, politics, business, science, the, arts, and, education, they, founded, most, of, the, country, s, leading, institutes, of, higher, education, the, protestant, concept, of, god, and, man, allows, believers, to, use, all, their, god, given, faculties, including, the, power, of, reason, that, means, that, they, are, allowed, to, explore, god, s, creation, and, according, to, genesis, 2, 15, make, use, of, it, in, a, responsible, and, sustainable, way, thus, a, cultural, climate, was, created, that, greatly, enhanced, the, development, of, the, humanities, and, the, sciences, another, consequence, of, the, protestant, understanding, of, man, is, that, the, believers, in, gratitude, for, their, election, and, redemption, in, christ, are, to, follow, god, s, commandments, industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and, a, strong, sense, of, responsibility, are, at, the, heart, of, their, moral, code, in, particular, calvin, rejected, luxury, therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and, other, businessmen, were, able, to, reinvest, the, greater, part, of, their, profits, in, the, most, efficient, machinery, and, the, most, modern, production, methods, that, were, based, on, progress, in, the, sciences, and, technology, as, a, result, productivity, grew, which, led, to, increased, profits, and, enabled, employers, to, pay, higher, wages, in, this, way, the, economy, the, sciences, and, technology, reinforced, each, other, the, chance, to, participate, in, the, economic, success, of, technological, inventions, was, a, strong, incentive, to, both, inventors, and, investors, the, protestant, work, ethic, was, an, important, force, behind, the, unplanned, and, uncoordinated, mass, action, that, influenced, the, development, of, capitalism, and, the, industrial, revolution, this, idea, is, also, known, as, the, protestant, ethic, thesis, however, eminent, historian, fernand, braudel, d, 1985, a, leader, of, the, important, annales, school, wrote, all, historians, have, opposed, this, tenuous, theory, although, they, have, not, managed, to, be, rid, of, it, once, and, for, all, yet, it, is, clearly, false, the, northern, countries, took, over, the, place, that, earlier, had, been, so, long, and, brilliantly, been, occupied, by, the, old, capitalist, centers, of, the, mediterranean, they, invented, nothing, either, in, technology, or, business, management, social, scientist, rodney, stark, moreover, comments, that, during, their, critical, period, of, economic, development, these, northern, centers, of, capitalism, were, catholic, not, protestant, the, reformation, still, lay, well, into, the, future, while, british, historian, hugh, trevor, roper, d, 2003, said, the, idea, that, large, scale, industrial, capitalism, was, ideologically, impossible, before, the, reformation, is, exploded, by, the, simple, fact, that, it, existed, in, a, factor, analysis, of, the, latest, wave, of, world, values, survey, data, arno, tausch, corvinus, university, of, budapest, found, that, protestantism, emerges, to, be, very, close, to, combining, religion, and, the, traditions, of, liberalism, the, global, value, development, index, calculated, by, tausch, relies, on, the, world, values, survey, dimensions, such, as, trust, in, the, state, of, law, no, support, for, shadow, economy, postmaterial, activism, support, for, democracy, a, non, acceptance, of, violence, xenophobia, and, racism, trust, in, transnational, capital, and, universities, confidence, in, the, market, economy, supporting, gender, justice, and, engaging, in, environmental, activism, etc, episcopalians, and, presbyterians, as, well, as, other, wasps, tend, to, be, considerably, wealthier, and, better, educated, having, graduate, and, post, graduate, degrees, per, capita, than, most, other, religious, groups, in, united, states, and, are, disproportionately, represented, in, the, upper, reaches, of, american, business, law, and, politics, especially, the, republican, party, numbers, of, the, most, wealthy, and, affluent, american, families, as, the, vanderbilts, the, astors, rockefellers, du, ponts, roosevelts, forbes, fords, whitneys, mellons, the, morgans, and, harrimans, are, mainline, protestant, families, protestantism, has, had, an, important, influence, on, science, according, to, the, merton, thesis, there, was, a, positive, correlation, between, the, rise, of, english, puritanism, and, german, pietism, on, the, one, hand, and, early, experimental, science, on, the, other, the, merton, thesis, has, two, separate, parts, firstly, it, presents, a, theory, that, science, changes, due, to, an, accumulation, of, observations, and, improvement, in, experimental, technique, and, methodology, secondly, it, puts, forward, the, argument, that, the, popularity, of, science, in, 17th, century, england, and, the, religious, demography, of, the, royal, society, english, scientists, of, that, time, were, predominantly, puritans, or, other, protestants, can, be, explained, by, a, correlation, between, protestantism, and, the, scientific, values, merton, focused, on, english, puritanism, and, german, pietism, as, having, been, responsible, for, the, development, of, the, scientific, revolution, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, he, explained, that, the, connection, between, religious, affiliation, and, interest, in, science, was, the, result, of, a, significant, synergy, between, the, ascetic, protestant, values, and, those, of, modern, science, protestant, values, encouraged, scientific, research, by, allowing, science, to, identify, god, s, influence, on, the, world, his, creation, and, thus, providing, a, religious, justification, for, scientific, research, according, to, scientific, elite, nobel, laureates, in, the, united, states, by, harriet, zuckerman, a, review, of, american, nobel, prizes, awarded, between, 1901, and, 1972, 72, of, american, nobel, prize, laureates, identified, a, protestant, background, overall, 84, of, all, the, nobel, prizes, awarded, to, americans, in, chemistry, 60, in, medicine, and, 59, in, physics, between, 1901, and, 1972, were, won, by, protestants, according, to, 100, years, of, nobel, prize, 2005, a, review, of, nobel, prizes, awarded, between, 1901, and, 2000, 65, of, nobel, prize, laureates, have, identified, christianity, in, its, various, forms, as, their, religious, preference, 423, prizes, while, 32, have, identified, with, protestantism, in, its, various, forms, 208, prizes, although, protestants, are, 12, to, 13, of, the, world, s, population, during, the, middle, ages, the, church, and, the, worldly, authorities, were, closely, related, martin, luther, separated, the, religious, and, the, worldly, realms, in, principle, doctrine, of, the, two, kingdoms, the, believers, were, obliged, to, use, reason, to, govern, the, worldly, sphere, in, an, orderly, and, peaceful, way, luther, s, doctrine, of, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, upgraded, the, role, of, laymen, in, the, church, considerably, the, members, of, a, congregation, had, the, right, to, elect, a, minister, and, if, necessary, to, vote, for, his, dismissal, treatise, on, the, right, and, authority, of, a, christian, assembly, or, congregation, to, judge, all, doctrines, and, to, call, install, and, dismiss, teachers, as, testified, in, scripture, 1523, calvin, strengthened, this, basically, democratic, approach, by, including, elected, laymen, church, elders, presbyters, in, his, representative, church, government, the, huguenots, added, regional, synods, and, a, national, synod, whose, members, were, elected, by, the, congregations, to, calvin, s, system, of, church, self, government, this, system, was, taken, over, by, the, other, reformed, churches, and, was, adopted, by, some, lutherans, beginning, with, those, in, j, lich, cleves, berg, during, the, 17th, century, politically, calvin, favored, a, mixture, of, aristocracy, and, democracy, he, appreciated, the, advantages, of, democracy, it, is, an, invaluable, gift, if, god, allows, a, people, to, freely, elect, its, own, authorities, and, overlords, calvin, also, thought, that, earthly, rulers, lose, their, divine, right, and, must, be, put, down, when, they, rise, up, against, god, to, further, protect, the, rights, of, ordinary, people, calvin, suggested, separating, political, powers, in, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, separation, of, powers, thus, he, and, his, followers, resisted, political, absolutism, and, paved, the, way, for, the, rise, of, modern, democracy, besides, england, the, netherlands, were, under, calvinist, leadership, the, freest, country, in, europe, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, it, granted, asylum, to, philosophers, like, baruch, spinoza, and, pierre, bayle, hugo, grotius, was, able, to, teach, his, natural, law, theory, and, a, relatively, liberal, interpretation, of, the, bible, consistent, with, calvin, s, political, ideas, protestants, created, both, the, english, and, the, american, democracies, in, seventeenth, century, england, the, most, important, persons, and, events, in, this, process, were, the, english, civil, war, oliver, cromwell, john, milton, john, locke, the, glorious, revolution, the, english, bill, of, rights, and, the, act, of, settlement, later, the, british, took, their, democratic, ideals, to, their, colonies, e, g, australia, new, zealand, and, india, in, north, america, plymouth, colony, pilgrim, fathers, 1620, and, massachusetts, bay, colony, 1628, practised, democratic, self, rule, and, separation, of, powers, these, congregationalists, were, convinced, that, the, democratic, form, of, government, was, the, will, of, god, the, mayflower, compact, was, a, social, contract, protestants, also, took, the, initiative, in, advocating, for, religious, freedom, freedom, of, conscience, had, a, high, priority, on, the, theological, philosophical, and, political, agendas, since, luther, refused, to, recant, his, beliefs, before, the, diet, of, the, holy, roman, empire, at, worms, 1521, in, his, view, faith, was, a, free, work, of, the, holy, spirit, and, could, therefore, not, be, forced, on, a, person, the, persecuted, anabaptists, and, huguenots, demanded, freedom, of, conscience, and, they, practiced, separation, of, church, and, state, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, baptists, like, john, smyth, and, thomas, helwys, published, tracts, in, defense, of, religious, freedom, their, thinking, influenced, john, milton, and, john, locke, s, stance, on, tolerance, under, the, leadership, of, baptist, roger, williams, congregationalist,

strongly, supported, the, independence, movement, all, major, protestant, churches, were, represented, in, the, first, and, second, continental, congresses, in, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, the, american, democracy, became, a, model, for, numerous, other, countries, and, regions, throughout, the, world, e, g, latin, america, japan, and, germany, the, strongest, link, between, the, american, and, french, revolutions, was, marquis, de, lafayette, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, american, constitutional, principles, the, french, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, was, mainly, based, on, lafayette, s, draft, of, this, document, the, declaration, by, united, nations, and, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, also, echo, the, american, constitutional, tradition, democracy, social, contract, theory, separation, of, powers, religious, freedom, separation, of, church, and, state, these, achievements, of, the, reformation, and, early, protestantism, were, elaborated, on, and, popularized, by, age, of, enlightenment, thinkers, some, of, the, philosophers, of, the, english, scottish, german, and, swiss, enlightenment, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, john, toland, david, hume, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, christian, wolff, immanuel, kant, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, had, protestant, backgrounds, for, example, john, locke, whose, political, thought, was, based, on, a, set, of, protestant, christian, assumptions, derived, the, equality, of, all, humans, including, the, equality, of, the, genders, adam, and, eve, from, genesis, 1, 26, 28, as, all, persons, were, created, equally, free, all, governments, needed, the, consent, of, the, governed, also, other, human, rights, were, advocated, for, by, some, protestants, for, example, torture, was, abolished, in, prussia, in, 1740, slavery, in, britain, in, 1834, and, in, the, united, states, in, 1865, william, wilberforce, harriet, beecher, stowe, abraham, lincoln, against, southern, protestants, hugo, grotius, and, samuel, pufendorf, were, among, the, first, thinkers, who, made, significant, contributions, to, international, law, the, geneva, convention, an, important, part, of, humanitarian, international, law, was, largely, the, work, of, henry, dunant, a, reformed, pietist, he, also, founded, the, red, cross, protestants, have, founded, hospitals, homes, for, disabled, or, elderly, people, educational, institutions, organizations, that, give, aid, to, developing, countries, and, other, social, welfare, agencies, in, the, nineteenth, century, throughout, the, anglo, american, world, numerous, dedicated, members, of, all, protestant, denominations, were, active, in, social, reform, movements, such, as, the, abolition, of, slavery, prison, reforms, and, woman, suffrage, as, an, answer, to, the, social, question, of, the, nineteenth, century, germany, under, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, introduced, insurance, programs, that, led, the, way, to, the, welfare, state, health, insurance, accident, insurance, disability, insurance, old, age, pensions, to, bismarck, this, was, practical, christianity, these, programs, too, were, copied, by, many, other, nations, particularly, in, the, western, world, the, young, men, s, christian, association, was, founded, by, congregationalist, george, williams, aimed, at, empowering,

and, many, others, the, view, of, the, catholic, church, is, that, protestant, denominations, cannot, be, considered, churches, but, rather, that, they, are, ecclesial, communities, or, specific, faith, believing, communities, because, their, ordinances, and, doctrines, are, not, historically, the, same, as, the, catholic, sacraments, and, dogmas, and, the, protestant, communities, have, no, sacramental, ministerial, priesthood, and, therefore, lack, true, apostolic, succession, according, to, bishop, hilarion, alfeyev, the, eastern, orthodox, church, shares, the, same, view, on, the, subject, contrary, to, how, the, protestant, reformers, were, often, characterized, the, concept, of, a, catholic, or, universal, church, was, not, brushed, aside, during, the, protestant, reformation, on, the, contrary, the, visible, unity, of, the, catholic, or, universal, church, was, seen, by, the, protestant, reformers, as, an, important, and, essential, doctrine, of, the, reformation, the, magisterial, reformers, such, as, martin, luther, john, calvin, and, huldrych, zwingli, believed, that, they, were, reforming, the, catholic, church, which, they, viewed, as, having, become, corrupted, each, of, them, took, very, seriously, the, charges, of, schism, and, innovation, denying, these, charges, and, maintaining, that, it, was, the, catholic, church, that, had, left, them, the, protestant, reformers, formed, a, new, and, radically, different, theological, opinion, on, ecclesiology, that, the, visible, church, is, catholic, lower, case, c, rather, than, catholic, upper, case, c, accordingly, there, is, not, an, indefinite, number, of, parochial, congregational, or, national, churches, constituting, as, it, were, so, many, ecclesiastical, individualities, but, one, great, spiritual, republic, of, which, these, various, organizations, form, a, part, although, they, each, have, very, different, opinions, this, was, markedly, far, removed, from, the, traditional, and, historic, catholic, understanding, that, the, roman, catholic, church, was, the, one, true, church, of, christ, yet, in, the, protestant, understanding, the, visible, church, is, not, a, genus, so, to, speak, with, so, many, species, under, it, in, order, to, justify, their, departure, from, the, catholic, church, protestants, often, posited, a, new, argument, saying, that, there, was, no, real, visible, church, with, divine, authority, only, a, spiritual, invisible, and, hidden, church, this, notion, began, in, the, early, days, of, the, protestant, reformation, wherever, the, magisterial, reformation, which, received, support, from, the, ruling, authorities, took, place, the, result, was, a, reformed, national, protestant, church, envisioned, to, be, a, part, of, the, whole, invisible, church, but, disagreeing, in, certain, important, points, of, doctrine, and, doctrine, linked, practice, with, what, had, until, then, been, considered, the, normative, reference, point, on, such, matters, namely, the, papacy, and, central, authority, of, the, catholic, church, the, reformed, churches, thus, believed, in, some, form, of, catholicity, founded, on, their, doctrines, of, the, five, solas, and, a, visible, ecclesiastical, organization, based, on, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, conciliar, movement, rejecting, the, papacy, and, papal, infallibility, in, favor, of, ecumenical, councils, but, rejecting, the, latest, ecumenical, council, the, council, of, trent, religious, unity, therefore, became, not, one, of, doctrine, and, identity, but, one, of, invisible, character, wherein, the, unity, was, one, of, faith, in, jesus, christ, not, common, identity, doctrine, belief, and, collaborative, action, there, are, protestants, especially, of, the, reformed, tradition, that, either, reject, or, down, play, the, designation, protestant, because, of, the, negative, idea, that, the, word, invokes, in, addition, to, its, primary, meaning, preferring, the, designation, reformed, evangelical, or, even, reformed, catholic, expressive, of, what, they, call, a, reformed, catholicity, and, defending, their, arguments, from, the, traditional, protestant, confessions, the, ecumenical, movement, has, had, an, influence, on, mainline, churches, beginning, at, least, in, 1910, with, the, edinburgh, missionary, conference, its, origins, lay, in, the, recognition, of, the, need, for, cooperation, on, the, mission, field, in, africa, asia, and, oceania, since, 1948, the, world, council, of, churches, has, been, influential, but, ineffective, in, creating, a, united, church, there, are, also, ecumenical, bodies, at, regional, national, and, local, levels, across, the, globe, but, schisms, still, far, outnumber, unifications, one, but, not, the, only, expression, of, the, ecumenical, movement, has, been, the, move, to, form, united, churches, such, as, the, church, of, south, india, the, church,
