and, activities, of, deities, heroes, and, mythological, creatures, and, the, origins, and, significance, of, the, ancient, persians, own, cult, and, ritual, practices, modern, scholars, study, the, myths, to, shed, light, on, the, religious, and, political, institutions, of, not, only, iran, but, of, the, persosphere, which, includes, regions, of, west, asia, central, asia, south, asia, and, transcaucasia, where, the, culture, of, iran, has, had, significant, influence, historically, these, were, regions, long, ruled, by, dynasties, of, various, iranian, empires, that, incorporated, considerable, aspects, of, persian, culture, through, extensive, contact, with, them, or, where, sufficient, iranian, peoples, settled, to, still, maintain, communities, who, patronize, their, respective, cultures, it, roughly, corresponds, to, the, iranian, plateau, and, its, bordering, plains, the, encyclop, dia, iranica, project, uses, the, term, iranian, cultural, continent, for, this, region, most, characters, in, persian, mythology, are, either, good, or, they, are, evil, the, resultant, discord, mirrors, the, nationalistic, ideals, of, the, early, islamic, era, as, well, as, the, moral, and, ethical, perceptions, of, the, zoroastrian, period, in, which, the, world, was, perceived, to, be, locked, in, a, battle, between, the, destructive, ahriman, and, his, hordes, of, demonic, div, s, and, their, aneran, supporters, versus, the, creator, ahura, mazda, who, although, not, participating, in, the, day, to, day, affairs, of, mankind, was, represented, in, the, world, by, the, izad, s, and, the, righteous, ahlav, iranians, the, only, written, texts, relating, to, religious, come, from, prophet, zoroaster, initiated, the, reforms, which, would, become, zoroastrianism, iranian, mythology, is, based, on, the, battle, between, good, and, evil, indo, iranian, peoples, believed, in, two, general, categories, of, gods, ahuras, and, evil, divan, the, characteristics, of, these, two, ranks, of, gods, among, iranians, and, hindus, and, were, transformed, into, each, other, in, the, sense, that, among, indians, ahuras, became, evil, and, divan, became, good, and, among, iranians, ahuras, became, good, and, divan, became, evil, they, sacrificed, for, both, types, of, gods, the, purpose, of, the, sacrifice, for, the, evil, gods, was, to, pay, them, a, ransom, to, stop, killing, people, sacrifice, was, made, for, good, gods, to, seek, help, and, blessing, from, them, on, the, other, side, of, the, fence, is, zahhak, a, symbol, of, despotism, who, was, finally, defeated, by, k, ve, who, led, a, popular, uprising, against, him, zahhak, avestan, a, i, dah, ka, was, guarded, by, two, vipers, which, grew, out, from, both, of, his, shoulders, no, matter, how, many, times, they, were, beheaded, new, heads, grew, on, them, to, guard, him, the, snake, like, in, many, other, mythologies, was, a, symbol, of, evil, but, many, other, animals, and, birds, appear, in, iranian, mythology, and, especially, the, birds, were, signs, of, good, omens, most, famous, of, these, is, the, simurgh, a, large, beautiful, and, powerful, bird, and, the, huma, bird, a, royal, bird, of, victory, whose, plume, adorned, persian, crowns, peri, avestan, pairika, a, beautiful, albeit, evil, woman, in, early, mythology, gradually, became, less, evil, and, more, beautiful, the, conflict, between, good, and, evil, is, prevalent, in, persian, myths, as, well, as, zoroastrianism, before, the, medes, individual, aryan, civilizations, lived, in, this, land, which, mostly, had, no, linguistic, racial, or, even, religious, kinship, with, their, neighbors, outside, the, iranian, plateau, and, sometimes, they, had, solidarity, these, tribes, included, lullubi, gutian, kassites, and, urartu, the, elamites, also, had, an, old, and, well, known, civilization, in, the, southwest, of, the, iranian, plateau, but, they, were, not, of, the, aryan, race, these, tribes, who, controlled, the, southern, half, of, iran, the, west, and, the, northwest, had, their, own, special, myths, not, much, is, known, about, their, mythology, however, kassites, mythology, has, some, similarities, with, later, iranian, civilizations, namely, the, medes, and, persians, especially, in, the, names, the, mythology, of, the, elamites, who, were, a, separate, people, and, had, linguistic, affinities, with, the, non, aryans, of, india, shares, some, myths, contained, in, the, rigveda, the, traditions, and, beliefs, of, these, people, influenced, the, beliefs, of, their, later, society, which, was, under, the, cultural, domination, of, the, aryans, with, the, power, of, the, medes, and, then, the, persians, a, newer, mythology, known, as, the, comprehensive, mythology, of, iran, began, researchers, believe, that, before, the, power, of, the, medes, a, branch, of, aryans, migrated, from, iran, to, india, that, is, why, the, ancient, forms, of, indian, mythology, are, very, similar, to, the, ancient, forms, of, iranian, mythology, the, mythology, of, iran, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, myths, of, the, native, peoples, of, the, iranian, plateau, and, the, myths, of, the, middle, river, researchers, have, shown, these, influences, in, many, places, in, iranian, mythology, indian, and, iranian, mythology, are, close, in, many, ways, this, proximity, is, sometimes, to, the, extent, of, the, similarity, of, the, names, of, persons, and, places, the, close, languages, of, these, two, groups, also, confirm, their, common, roots, therefore, the, origin, of, the, mythology, of, these, two, nations, has, been, the, same, in, the, distant, past, but, the, migration, of, indians, from, the, aryan, plateau, to, lands, with, different, nature, and, climatic, conditions, as, well, as, indigenous, peoples, has, brought, about, fundamental, changes, in, their, mythology, and, religious, beliefs, there, are, good, and, evil, forces, in, both, of, these, myths, the, names, of, their, gods, are, close, to, each, other, fire, is, sacred, and, praised, in, iranian, and, indian, beliefs, and, they, used, to, perform, sacrifices, for, the, gods, in, a, similar, manner, the, oldest, examples, of, the, ancient, form, of, iranian, mythology, are, references, in, avesta, especially, in, yashta, because, yashta, are, above, all, a, collection, of, prayer, hymns, there, are, no, detailed, references, to, myths, in, them, everything, is, closed, and, short, the, most, detailed, texts, about, iranian, mythology, are, in, zoroastrian, writings, in, middle, persian, the, final, compilation, of, most, of, them, is, in, the, early, islamic, era, but, most, of, them, are, based, on, the, texts, of, the, late, sassanid, period, some, of, the, most, famous, of, these, books, are, bundahisn, denkard, and, the, vendidad, the, other, major, source, for, persian, mythology, is, the, shahnameh, the, book, of, kings, written, by, the, persian, poet, abolqasem, ferdowsi, 940, 1020, ce, in, the, mythological, beliefs, of, iranians, before, zoroastrian, the, world, was, round, and, flat, like, a, plate, the, sky, was, also, imagined, as, stone, and, hard, as, a, diamond, the, earth, in, the, center, was, completely, flat, and, untouched, and, there, was, no, movement, between, the, earth, the, moon, and, the, stars, but, everything, changed, by, ahura, mazda, the, dynamism, arose, the, mountains, were, created, the, rivers, flowed, and, the, moon, and, stars, began, to, rotate, in, the, general, picture, of, the, world, at, that, time, the, world, was, divided, into, seven, regions, the, center, of, which, was, called, khoonirth, and, six, satellite, lands, were, around, it, the, sky, had, three, levels, of, star, base, moon, base, and, sun, base, dark, mountain, which, was, located, in, alborz, was, considered, the, center, of, the, universe, the, message, of, iranian, myths, is, the, confrontation, of, two, gems, of, good, and, evil, one, is, truth, and, the, other, is, untruth, one, is, fragrant, and, the, other, is, bright, one, is, light, and, the, other, is, darkness, in, fact, serving, good, concepts, is, still, one, of, the, great, mythological, messages, of, iran, in, iranian, mythology, what, can, be, seen, everywhere, in, all, mythological, narratives, is, the, presence, of, evil, and, evil, forces, in, the, world, these, evil, forces, which, are, considered, to, be, the, assistants, of, angra, mainyu, ahriman, are, mentioned, by, the, names, of, div, and, druq, these, two, have, male, and, female, genders, and, against, every, good, thing, in, the, world, in, iranian, mythology, the, world, is, always, the, scene, of, conflict, between, these, evil, and, good, forces, ahura, mazda, and, ahriman, have, been, at, war, with, each, other, since, eternity, and, life, in, the, world, is, a, reflection, of, the, cosmic, struggle, of, the, two, ahriman, s, place, of, residence, is, the, north, of, the, earth, where, the, whole, divan, of, zeed, and, islah, ahriman, appears, in, 3, forms, other, than, his, image, chelpasa, lizard, snake, and, young, although, he, is, mentioned, in, the, shahnameh, of, the, mardosh, kingdom, in, the, avesta, he, is, a, three, headed, six, eyed, and, three, nosed, demon, with, a, body, full, of, scorpions, however, based, on, zoroastrian, writings, in, the, final, days, of, the, world, it, is, ahura, mazda, who, will, win, over, ahriman, and, destroy, him, forever, and, after, that, only, goodness, light, and, health, will, remain, in, the, world, creation, takes, place, within, twelve, thousand, mythological, years, these, twelve, thousand, years, are, divided, into, four, periods, of, three, thousand, years, the, first, three, thousand, years, begins, with, the, birth, of, two, children, named, ahura, maza, and, ahriman, from, zarvan, in, the, first, three, thousand, years, the, world, is, minoan, and, there, is, still, neither, place, nor, time, in, this, period, two, entities, are, mentioned, one, is, the, world, belonging, to, ahura, maza, which, is, full, of, light, life, knowledge, beauty, and, fragrance, and, the, second, is, the, world, belonging, to, ahriman, which, is, dark, ugly, smelly, and, full, of, sorrow, and, disease, ahura, maza, first, creates, amesha, spenta, which, are, sepand, mino, khordad, mordad, bahman, ordibehesht, shahrivar, and, spandarmad, after, the, creation, of, amshaspandan, ahura, mazda, creates, the, gods, ahriman, also, creates, sardivan, for, each, of, amshaspandans, to, deal, with, ahura, maza, at, the, end, of, the, first, three, thousand, years, a, peace, is, made, between, ahura, mazda, and, ahriman, that, the, last, battle, between, the, forces, of, evil, and, good, will, take, place, nine, thousand, years, later, after, the, pact, is, concluded, ahura, mazda, utters, the, true, prayer, ahunur, and, as, a, result, ahriman, falls, to, hell, and, remains, unconscious, there, for, the, second, three, thousand, years, the, second, three, thousand, years, after, ahriman, s, unconsciousness, ahura, mazda, begins, the, creation, of, the, world, he, creates, the, sky, water, earth, plants, animals, and, humans, in, one, year, the, anniversary, of, these, creations, are, six, festivals, which, are, known, as, gahambars, the, main, prototypes, of, creation, are, the, cow, four, legged, animals, and, the, human, beings, at, the, end, of, the, second, three, thousand, years, ahriman, with, the, help, of, his, allies, returns, and, decides, to, destroy, the, current, world, the, third, three, thousand, years, in, this, period, we, see, the, conflict, of, ahriman, and, his, demons, with, ahura, maza, and, his, gods, meanwhile, ahriman, kills, the, created, cow, grains, plants, and, animals, are, created, after, 40, years, a, rhubarb, branch, grows, from, the, seed, of, keyumars, which, has, two, stalks, and, fifteen, leaves, these, fifteen, leaves, are, in, accordance, with, the, years, that, mishiyeh, and, mishyaneh, the, first, adam, couple, have, at, that, time, mishiyeh, is, male, and, mishyaneh, is, female, mishiyeh, is, known, as, the, father, of, humans, and, mishyaneh, as, the, mother, of, humans, ahriman, attacks, their, thoughts, and, they, utter, the, first, lie, and, attribute, creation, to, ahriman, they, both, repent, and, have, seven, pairs, of, children, and, die, after, living, for, a, hundred, years, the, genealogy, of, the, descendants, of, mishiyeh, and, mishyaneh, includes, the, origins, of, many, different, races, the, iranian, race, is, from, a, couple, called, siamak, and, neshak, after, them, farag, farwagin, and, after, them, the, couple, hushang, and, guzak, are, born, the, fourth, three, thousand, years, the, third, three, thousand, years, ends, in, the, middle, of, the, era, of, kay, lohrasp, the, most, important, feature, of, this, period, is, the, emergence, of, zoroaster, this, period, is, the, period, of, religious, revelation, ahura, mazda, reveals, the, secrets, of, religion, to, zoroaster, and, he, declares, himself, a, prophet, of, zoroastrianism, religion, and, his, mission, mazdaism, is, a, religion, that, has, ahura, mazda, at, the, head, of, their, gods, and, in, other, words, it, is, zoroastrian, religion, after, zoroaster, s, death, oshidar, oshidar, mah, and, saoshyant, take, over, the, leadership, of, behdinan, sushyant, period, is, the, period, of, evolution, of, urmazdi, creatures, and, all, divans, from, the, generation, of, bipeds, and, quadrupeds,

iranian, history, according, to, mythological, texts, which, are, related, to, kay, lohrasp, this, series, of, kings, who, brought, the, beginning, of, human, civilization, to, iranians, and, were, able, to, record, fire, and, use, of, metals, and, other, living, things, and, capturing, the, court, in, their, records, it, starts, from, kay, lohrasp, and, ends, at, garshasp, however, all, these, are, mythological, characters, in, the, avesta, and, in, the, zoroastrian, texts, of, the, sasanian, period, they, are, gods, of, the, izder, race, kayanian, dynasty, the, kayanians, are, the, second,

history, this, period, corresponds, to, the, time, when, the, iranian, mythological, narrative, coincides, with, concrete, historical, data, such, as, stone, inscriptions, and, greek, texts, it, means, the, fall, of, iran, at, the, hands, of, alexander, however, the, iranian, narrative, considered, the, reign, of, alexander, and, the, greeks, to, be, very, short, and, did, not, assume, any, time, for, the, seleucids, it, also, estimated, the, period, of, 450, years, of, rule, of, the, parthians, to, be, only, 200, years, the, final, data, of, the, parthian, era, in, iranian, mythology,
