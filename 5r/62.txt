reportedly, haunted, locations, a, superstition, is, any, belief, or, practice, considered, by, non, practitioners, to, be, irrational, or, supernatural, attributed, to, fate, or, magic, perceived, supernatural, influence, or, fear, of, that, which, is, unknown, it, is, commonly, applied, to, beliefs, and, practices, surrounding, luck, amulets, astrology, fortune, telling, spirits, and, certain, paranormal, entities, particularly, the, belief, that, future, events, can, be, foretold, by, specific, unrelated, prior, events, the, word, superstition, is, also, used, to, refer, to, a, religion, not, practiced, by, the, majority, of, a, given, society, regardless, of, whether, the, prevailing, religion, contains, alleged, superstitions, or, to, all, religions, by, the, antireligious, definitions, of, the, term, vary, but, they, commonly, describe, superstitions, as, irrational, beliefs, at, odds, with, scientific, knowledge, of, the, world, stuart, vyse, proposes, that, a, superstition, s, presumed, mechanism, of, action, is, inconsistent, with, our, understanding, of, the, physical, world, with, jane, risen, adding, that, these, beliefs, are, not, merely, scientifically, wrong, but, impossible, similarly, lysann, damisch, defines, superstition, as, irrational, beliefs, that, an, object, action, or, circumstance, that, is, not, logically, related, to, a, course, of, events, influences, its, outcome, dale, martin, says, they, presuppose, an, erroneous, understanding, about, cause, and, effect, that, have, been, rejected, by, modern, science, the, oxford, english, dictionary, describes, them, as, irrational, unfounded, merriam, webster, as, a, false, conception, about, causation, or, belief, or, practice, and, the, cambridge, dictionary, as, sans, grounding, in, human, reason, or, scientific, knowledge, this, notion, of, superstitious, practices, is, not, causally, related, to, the, outcomes, both, vyse, and, martin, argue, that, what, is, considered, superstitious, varies, across, cultures, and, time, for, vyse, if, a, culture, has, not, yet, adopted, science, as, its, standard, then, what, we, consider, magic, or, superstition, is, more, accurately, the, local, science, or, religion, dale, points, out, that, superstitions, are, often, considered, out, of, place, in, modern, times, and, are, influenced, by, modern, science, and, its, notions, of, what, is, rational, or, irrational, surviving, as, remnants, of, older, popular, beliefs, and, practices, vyse, proposes, that, in, addition, to, being, irrational, and, culturally, dependent, superstitions, have, to, be, instrumental, an, actual, effect, is, expected, by, the, person, holding, a, belief, such, as, increased, odds, of, winning, a, prize, this, distinction, excludes, practices, where, participants, merely, expect, to, be, entertained, religious, practices, that, differ, from, commonly, accepted, religions, in, a, given, culture, are, sometimes, called, superstitious, similarly, new, practices, brought, into, an, established, religious, community, can, also, be, labeled, as, superstitious, in, an, attempt, to, exclude, them, also, an, excessive, display, of, devoutness, has, often, been, labelled, as, superstitious, behavior, in, antiquity, the, latin, term, superstitio, like, its, equivalent, greek, deisidaimonia, came, to, be, associated, with, exaggerated, ritual, and, a, credulous, attitude, towards, prophecies, greek, and, roman, polytheists, who, modeled, their, relations, with, the, gods, on, political, and, social, terms, scorned, the, man, who, constantly, trembled, with, fear, at, the, thought, of, the, gods, as, a, slave, feared, a, cruel, and, capricious, master, such, fear, of, the, gods, was, what, the, romans, meant, by, superstition, veyne, 1987, p, 211, diderot, s, encyclop, die, defines, superstition, as, any, excess, of, religion, in, general, and, links, it, specifically, with, paganism, in, his, prelude, on, the, babylonian, captivity, of, the, church, martin, luther, who, called, the, papacy, that, fountain, and, source, of, all, superstitions, accuses, the, popes, of, superstition, for, there, was, scarce, another, of, the, celebrated, bishoprics, that, had, so, few, learned, pontiffs, only, in, violence, intrigue, and, superstition, has, it, hitherto, surpassed, the, rest, for, the, men, who, occupied, the, roman, see, a, thousand, years, ago, differ, so, vastly, from, those, who, have, since, come, into, power, that, one, is, compelled, to, refuse, the, name, of, roman, pontiff, either, to, the, former, or, to, the, latter, the, current, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, considers, superstition, sinful, in, the, sense, that, it, denotes, a, perverse, excess, of, religion, as, a, demonstrated, lack, of, trust, in, divine, providence, 2110, and, a, violation, of, the, first, of, the, ten, commandments, the, catechism, is, a, defense, against, the, accusation, that, catholic, doctrine, is, superstitious, superstition, is, a, deviation, of, religious, feeling, and, of, the, practices, this, feeling, imposes, it, can, even, affect, the, worship, we, offer, the, true, god, e, g, when, one, attributes, an, importance, in, some, way, magical, to, certain, practices, otherwise, lawful, or, necessary, to, attribute, the, efficacy, of, prayers, or, of, sacramental, signs, to, their, mere, external, performance, apart, from, the, interior, dispositions, that, they, demand, is, to, fall, into, superstition, cf, matthew, 23, 16, 22, 2111, dieter, harmening, s, book, superstitio, categorizes, superstitions, in, three, categories, magic, divination, and, observances, he, further, divides, observances, category, in, signs, and, time, time, sub, category, constitutes, temporal, prognostics, like, observances, of, various, days, related, like, dog, days, egyptian, days, year, prognosis, and, lunaries, where, as, signs, category, constitutes, signs, like, particular, animal, behaviors, like, the, call, of, birds, or, neighing, of, horses, or, sighting, of, comets, or, dreams, according, to, l, szl, s, ndor, chardonnens, the, signs, subcategory, usually, needs, an, observer, who, might, help, in, interpreting, the, signs, and, such, observer, does, not, need, necessarily, to, be, an, active, participant, of, the, observation, according, to, chardonnens, category, of, divination, participant, need, to, go, beyond, mere, observation, and, need, to, be, active, participant, in, given, action, examples, of, divination, superstitions, are, judicial, astrology, necromancy, haruspex, lot, casting, geomancy, aeromancy, and, prophecy, chardonnens, says, superstitions, belonging, to, magic, category, are, exceedingly, hermetical, and, ritualistic, and, its, examples, are, witchcraft, potions, incantations, amulets, etc, chardonnens, says, observation, category, needs, an, observer, divination, category, needs, participant, to, tell, what, is, to, be, observed, where, as, magic, requires, a, participant, who, must, follow, a, protocol, to, influence, the, future, and, that, these, three, types, of, superstition, need, increasing, stages, of, participation, and, knowledge, chardonnens, defines, prognostication, as, that, component, of, superstition, which, expects, knowledge, of, the, future, on, systematic, application, of, given, ritual, and, order, and, moves, to, classify, saying, prognostication, appear, to, occupy, a, place, somewhere, between, observation, and, divination, of, which, due, to, the, primacy, of, temporal, prognostics, the, observation, of, times, is, represented, most, frequently, chardonnens, classifies, prophecy, under, topic, of, divination, examples, being, the, prophets, of, the, old, testament, biblical, typological, allegory, the, fifteen, signs, before, judgement, day, and, the, many, prophecies, expressed, by, saints, chardonnens, further, points, out, that, since, many, aspects, of, religious, experience, are, tied, up, with, prophecy, church, condones, the, same, chardonnens, says, one, could, differentiate, between, those, kinds, of, prophecy, which, are, 1, inspired, by, god, or, satan, and, their, minions, 2, gecyndelic, and, 3, wiglung, examples, lacking, divine, or, infernal, inspiration, and, not, gecyndelic, either, but, practically, however, most, if, not, all, words, relating, to, prophecy, ought, to, be, interpreted, as, inspired, identifying, something, as, superstition, is, generally, pejorative, items, referred, to, as, such, in, common, parlance, are, commonly, referred, to, as, folk, belief, in, folkloristics, according, to, l, szl, s, ndor, chardonnens, oed, definitions, pass, value, judgement, and, attribution, to, fear, and, ignorance, do, not, do, enough, justice, to, elaborate, systems, of, superstitions, chardonnens, says, the, religious, element, in, oed, denotations, are, not, understood, as, system, of, observance, and, testifies, to, a, belief, in, higher, power, on, part, of, the, compiler, of, the, dictionary, webster, s, the, encyclopedia, of, superstitions, points, out, that, many, superstitions, are, related, with, religion, people, have, been, carrying, individual, subjective, perceptions, vis, a, vis, superstitions, against, one, another, people, of, one, belief, are, likely, to, call, people, of, another, belief, superstitious, constantine, regarded, paganism, as, a, superstition, tacitus, on, other, hand, regarded, christianity, as, pernicious, superstition, saul, of, tarsus, and, martin, luther, perceived, any, thing, that, was, not, centered, on, christ, to, be, superstitious, according, to, dale, difference, of, opinion, on, what, constitutes, superstition, become, apparent, when, one, moves, form, one, culture, to, another, culture, while, the, formation, of, the, latin, word, is, clear, from, the, verb, super, stare, to, stand, over, stand, upon, survive, its, original, intended, sense, is, less, clear, it, can, be, interpreted, as, standing, over, a, thing, in, amazement, or, awe, but, other, possibilities, have, been, suggested, e, g, the, sense, of, excess, i, e, over, scrupulousness, or, over, ceremoniousness, in, the, performing, of, religious, rites, or, else, the, survival, of, old, irrational, religious, habits, the, earliest, known, use, as, a, noun, is, found, in, plautus, ennius, and, later, by, pliny, with, the, meaning, of, art, of, divination, from, its, use, in, the, classical, latin, of, livy, and, ovid, it, is, used, in, the, pejorative, sense, that, it, holds, today, of, an, excessive, fear, of, the, gods, or, unreasonable, religious, belief, as, opposed, to, religio, the, proper, reasonable, awe, of, the, gods, cicero, derived, the, term, from, superstitiosi, lit, those, who, are, left, over, i, e, survivors, descendants, connecting, it, with, excessive, anxiety, of, parents, in, hoping, that, their, children, would, survive, them, to, perform, their, necessary, funerary, rites, according, to, michael, david, bailey, it, was, with, pliny, s, usage, that, magic, came, close, to, superstition, and, charges, of, being, superstitious, were, first, leveled, by, roman, authorities, on, their, christian, subjects, in, turn, early, christian, writers, pronounced, all, roman, and, pagan, cults, to, be, superstitious, worshipping, false, gods, fallen, angels, and, demons, it, is, with, christian, usage, that, almost, all, forms, of, magic, started, being, described, as, forms, of, superstition, in, 1948, behavioral, psychologist, b, f, skinner, published, an, article, in, the, journal, of, experimental, psychology, in, which, he, described, his, pigeons, exhibiting, what, appeared, to, be, superstitious, behaviour, one, pigeon, was, making, turns, in, its, cage, another, would, swing, its, head, in, a, pendulum, motion, while, others, also, displayed, a, variety, of, other, behaviours, because, these, behaviors, were, all, done, ritualistically, in, an, attempt, to, receive, food, from, a, dispenser, even, though, the, dispenser, had, already, been, programmed, to, release, food, at, set, time, intervals, regardless, of, the, pigeons, actions, skinner, believed, that, the, pigeons, were, trying, to, influence, their, feeding, schedule, by, performing, these, actions, he, then, extended, this, as, a, proposition, regarding, the, nature, of, superstitious, behavior, in, humans, skinner, s, theory, regarding, superstition, being, the, nature, of, the, pigeons, behaviour, has, been, challenged, by, other, psychologists, such, as, staddon, and, simmelhag, who, theorised, an, alternative, explanation, for, the, pigeons, behaviour, despite, challenges, to, skinner, s, interpretation, of, the, root, of, his, pigeons, superstitious, behaviour, his, conception, of, the, reinforcement, schedule, has, been, used, to, explain, superstitious, behaviour, in, humans, originally, in, skinner, s, animal, research, some, pigeons, responded, up, to, 10, 000, times, without, reinforcement, when, they, had, originally, been, conditioned, on, an, intermittent, reinforcement, basis, compared, to, the, other, reinforcement, schedules, e, g, fixed, ratio, fixed, interval, these, behaviours, were, also, the, most, resistant, to, extinction, this, is, called, the, partial, reinforcement, effect, and, this, has, been, used, to, explain, superstitious, behaviour, in, humans, to, be, more, precise, this, effect, means, that, whenever, an, individual, performs, an, action, expecting, a, reinforcement, and, none, seems, forthcoming, it, actually, creates, a, sense, of, persistence, within, the, individual, from, a, simpler, perspective, natural, selection, will, tend, to, reinforce, a, tendency, to, generate, weak, associations, or, heuristics, that, are, overgeneralized, if, there, is, a, strong, survival, advantage, to, making, correct, associations, then, this, will, outweigh, the, negatives, of, making, many, incorrect, superstitious, associations, it, has, also, been, argued, that, there, may, be, connections, between, ocd, and, superstition, it, is, stated, that, superstition, is, at, the, end, of, the, day, long, held, beliefs, that, are, rooted, in, coincidence, and, or, cultural, tradition, rather, than, logic, and, facts, ocd, that, involves, superstition, is, often, referred, to, as, magical, thinking, people, with, this, kind, of, manifestation, of, ocd, believe, that, if, they, do, not, follow, through, with, a, certain, compulsion, then, something, bad, will, happen, to, either, themselves, or, others, superstitious, ocd, while, can, appear, in, anyone, with, ocd, more, often, appears, in, people, with, a, religious, background, or, with, people, who, grew, up, in, a, culture, that, believes, in, magic, and, perform, rituals, like, stated, before, in, the, article, above, superstition, and, prophecies, are, sometimes, linked, together, people, with, religious, or, superstitious, ocd, may, have, compulsions, and, perform, rituals, or, behaviors, in, order, to, fulfill, or, get, closer, to, fulfilling, a, prophecy, those, with, magical, thinking, ocd, may, realize, that, doing, an, action, will, not, actually, save, someone, but, the, fear, that, if, they, do, not, perform, a, certain, behavior, someone, could, get, hurt, is, so, overwhelming, that, they, do, it, just, to, be, sure, people, with, superstitious, ocd, will, go, out, of, their, way, to, avoid, something, deemed, unlucky, such, as, the, 13th, floor, of, a, building, the, 13th, room, certain, numbers, or, colors, because, if, they, do, not, they, believe, something, horrible, may, happen, though, superstitious, ocd, may, work, in, reverse, where, one, will, always, wear, a, certain, item, of, clothing, or, jewelry, or, carry, a, certain, item, like, a, bag, because, it, brings, them, luck, and, allow, good, things, to, happen, a, recent, theory, by, jane, risen, proposes, that, superstitions, are, intuitions, that, people, acknowledge, to, be, wrong, but, acquiesce, to, rather, than, correct, when, they, arise, as, the, intuitive, assessment, of, a, situation, her, theory, draws, on, dual, process, models, of, reasoning, in, this, view, superstitions, are, the, output, of, system, 1, reasoning, that, are, not, corrected, even, when, caught, by, system, 2, people, seem, to, believe, that, superstitions, influence, events, by, changing, the, likelihood, of, currently, possible, outcomes, rather, than, by, creating, new, possible, outcomes, in, sporting, events, for, example, a, lucky, ritual, or, object, is, thought, to, increase, the, chance, that, an, athlete, will, perform, at, the, peak, of, their, ability, rather, than, increasing, their, overall, ability, at, that, sport, psychologist, stuart, vyse, has, pointed, out, that, until, about, 2010, ost, researchers, assumed, superstitions, were, irrational, and, focused, their, attentions, on, discovering, why, people, were, superstitious, vyse, went, on, to, describe, studies, that, looked, at, the, relationship, between, performance, and, superstitious, rituals, preliminary, work, has, indicated, that, such, rituals, can, reduce, stress, and, thereby, improve, performance, but, vyse, has, said, not, because, they, are, superstitious, but, because, they, are, rituals, so, there, is, no, real, magic, but, there, is, a, bit, of, calming, magic, in, performing, a, ritualistic, sequence, before, attempting, a, high, pressure, activity, any, old, ritual, will, do, people, tend, to, attribute, events, to, supernatural, causes, in, psychological, terms, external, causes, most, often, under, two, circumstances, according, to, consumer, behavior, analytics, of, john, c, mowen, et, al, superstitions, are, employed, as, a, heuristic, tool, hence, those, influence, a, variety, of, consumer, behaviors, john, c, mowen, et, al, says, after, taking, into, account, for, a, set, of, antecedents, trait, superstitions, are, predictive, of, a, wide, variety, of, consumer, beliefs, like, beliefs, in, astrology, or, in, common, negative, superstitions, e, g, fear, of, black, cats, a, general, proneness, to, be, superstitious, leads, to, enduring, temperament, to, gamble, participation, in, promotional, games, investments, in, stocks, forwarding, of, superstitious, e, mails, keeping, good, luck, charms, and, exhibit, sport, fanship, etc, additionally, it, has, been, estimated, that, between, 700, million, and, 800, million, are, lost, every, friday, the, 13th, because, of, people, s, refusal, to, travel, purchase, major, items, or, conduct, business, ancient, greek, historian, polybius, in, his, histories, uses, the, word, superstition, explaining, that, in, ancient, rome, that, belief, maintained, the, cohesion, of, the, empire, operating, as, an, instrumentum, regni, in, the, classical, era, the, existence, of, gods, was, actively, debated, both, among, philosophers, and, theologians, and, opposition, to, superstition, arose, consequently, the, poem, de, rerum, natura, written, by, the, roman, poet, and, philosopher, lucretius, further, developed, the, opposition, to, superstition, cicero, s, work, de, natura, deorum, also, had, a, great, influence, on, the, development, of, the, modern, concept, of, superstition, as, well, as, the, word, itself, where, cicero, distinguished, superstitio, and, religio, lucretius, used, only, the, word, religio, cicero, for, whom, superstitio, meant, excessive, fear, of, the, gods, wrote, that, superstitio, non, religio, tollenda, est, which, means, that, only, superstition, and, not, religion, should, be, abolished, the, roman, empire, also, made, laws, condemning, those, who, excited, excessive, religious, fear, in, others, during, the, middle, ages, the, idea, of, god, s, influence, on, the, world, s, events, went, mostly, undisputed, trials, by, ordeal, were, quite, frequent, even, though, frederick, ii, 1194, 1250, ad, was, the, first, king, who, explicitly, outlawed, trials, by, ordeal, as, they, were, considered, irrational, the, rediscovery, of, lost, classical, works, the, renaissance, and, scientific, advancement, led, to, a, steadily, increasing, disbelief, in, superstition, a, new, more, rationalistic, lens, was, beginning, to, see, use, in, exegesis, opposition, to, superstition, was, central, to, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, first, philosopher, who, dared, to, criticize, superstition, publicly, and, in, a, written, form, was, baruch, spinoza, who, was, a, key, figure, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, most, superstitions, arose, over, the, course, of, centuries, and, are, rooted, in, regional, and, historical, circumstances, such, as, religious, beliefs, or, the, natural, environment, for, instance, geckos, are, believed, to, be, of, medicinal, value, in, many, asian, countries, including, china, in, china, feng, shui, is, a, belief, system, that, different, places, have, negative, effects, e, g, that, a, room, in, the, northwest, corner, of, a, house, is,
