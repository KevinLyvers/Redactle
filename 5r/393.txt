man, that, until, then, had, been, one, in, the, sumerian, version, of, the, flood, myth, the, causes, of, the, flood, and, the, reasons, for, the, hero, s, survival, are, unknown, due, to, the, fact, that, the, beginning, of, the, tablet, describing, the, story, has, been, destroyed, nonetheless, kramer, has, stated, that, it, can, probably, be, reasonably, inferred, that, the, hero, ziusudra, survives, due, to, enki, s, aid, because, that, is, what, happens, in, the, later, akkadian, and, babylonian, versions, of, the, story, 97, 99, in, the, later, legend, of, atrahasis, enlil, the, king, of, the, gods, sets, out, to, eliminate, humanity, whose, noise, is, disturbing, his, rest, he, successively, sends, drought, famine, and, plague, to, eliminate, humanity, but, enki, thwarts, his, half, brother, s, plans, by, teaching, atrahasis, how, to, counter, these, threats, each, time, atrahasis, asks, the, population, to, abandon, worship, of, all, gods, except, the, one, responsible, for, the, calamity, and, this, seems, to, shame, them, into, relenting, humans, however, proliferate, a, fourth, time, enraged, enlil, convenes, a, council, of, deities, and, gets, them, to, promise, not, to, tell, humankind, that, he, plans, their, total, annihilation, enki, does, not, tell, atrahasis, directly, but, speaks, to, him, in, secret, via, a, reed, wall, he, instructs, atrahasis, to, build, a, boat, in, order, to, rescue, his, family, and, other, living, creatures, from, the, coming, deluge, after, the, seven, day, deluge, the, flood, hero, frees, a, swallow, a, raven, and, a,

is, named, as, the, culprit, enki, explains, that, enlil, is, unfair, to, punish, the, guiltless, and, the, gods, institute, measures, to, ensure, that, humanity, does, not, become, too, populous, in, the, future, this, is, one, of, the, oldest, of, the, surviving, middle, eastern, deluge, myths, the, myth, enki, and, inanna, tells, the, story, of, how, the, young, goddess, of, the, anna, temple, of, uruk, feasts, with, her, father, enki, the, two, deities, participate, in, a, drinking, competition, then, enki, thoroughly, inebriated, gives, inanna, all, of, the, mes, the, next, morning, when, enki, awakes, with, a, hangover, he, asks, his, servant, isimud, for, the, mes, only, to, be, informed, that, he, has, given, them, to, inanna, upset, he, sends, galla, to, recover, them, inanna, sails, away, in, the, boat, of, heaven, and, arrives, safely, back, at, the, quay, of, uruk, eventually, enki, admits, his, defeat, and, accepts, a, peace, treaty, with, uruk, politically, this, myth, would, seem, to, indicate, events, of, an, early, period, when, political, authority, passed, from, enki, s, city, of, eridu, to, inanna, s, city, of, uruk, in, the, myth, of, inanna, s, descent, inanna, in, order, to, console, her, grieving, sister, ereshkigal, who, is, mourning, the, death, of, her, husband, gugalana, gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky, heaven, slain, by, gilgamesh, and, enkidu, sets, out, to, visit, her, sister, inanna, tells, her, servant, ninshubur, lady, evening, a, reference, to, inanna, s, role, as, the, evening, star, to, get, help, from, anu, enlil, or, enki, if, she, does, not, return, in, three, days, after, inanna, has, not, come, back, ninshubur, approaches, anu, only, to, be, told, that, he, knows, the, goddess, s, strength, and, her, ability, to, take, care, of, herself, while, enlil, tells, ninshubur, he, is, busy, running, the, cosmos, enki, immediately, expresses, concern, and, dispatches, his, galla, galaturra, or, kurgarra, sexless, beings, created, from, the, dirt, from, beneath, the, god, s, finger, nails, to, recover, the, young, goddess, these, beings, may, be, the, origin, of, the, greco, roman, galli, androgynous, beings, of, the, third, sex, who, played, an, important, part, in, early, religious, ritual, in, the, story, inanna, and, shukaletuda, shukaletuda, the, gardener, set, by, enki, to, care, for, the, date, palm, he, had, created, finds, inanna, sleeping, under, the, palm, tree, and, rapes, the, goddess, in, her, sleep, awaking, she, discovers, that, she, has, been, violated, and, seeks, to, punish, the, miscreant, shukaletuda, seeks, protection, from, enki, whom, bott, ro, believes, to, be, his, father, in, classic, enkian, fashion, the, father, advises, shukaletuda, to, hide, in, the, city, where, inanna, will, not, be, able, to, find, him, enki, as, the, protector, of, whoever, comes, to, seek, his, help, and, as, the, empowerer, of, inanna, here, challenges, the, young, impetuous, goddess, to, control, her, anger, so, as, to, be, better, able, to, function, as, a, great, judge, eventually, after, cooling, her, anger, she, too, seeks, the, help, of, enki, as, spokesperson, of, the, assembly, of, the, gods, the, igigi, and, the, anunnaki, after, she, presents, her, case, enki, sees, that, justice, needs, to, be, done, and, promises, help, delivering, knowledge, of, where, the, miscreant, is, hiding, enki, and, later, ea, were, apparently, depicted, sometimes, as, a, man, covered, with, the, skin, of, a, fish, and, this, representation, as, likewise, the, name, of, his, temple, e, apsu, house, of, the, watery, deep, points, decidedly, to, his, original, character, as, a, god, of, the, waters, see, oannes, around, the, excavation, of, the, 18, shrines, found, on, the, spot, thousands, of, carp, bones, were, found, consumed, possibly, in, feasts, to, the, god, of, his, cult, at, eridu, which, goes, back, to, the, oldest, period, of, mesopotamian, history, nothing, definite, is, known, except, that, his, temple, was, also, associated, with, ninhursag, s, temple, which, was, called, esaggila, the, lofty, head, house, e, house, sag, head, ila, high, or, akkadian, goddess, ila, a, name, shared, with, marduk, s, temple, in, babylon, pointing, to, a, staged, tower, or, ziggurat, as, with, the, temple, of, enlil, at, nippur, which, was, known, as, e, kur, kur, hill, and, that, incantations, involving, ceremonial, rites, in, which, water, as, a, sacred, element, played, a, prominent, part, formed, a, feature, of, his, worship, this, seems, also, implicated, in, the, epic, of, the, hieros, gamos, or, sacred, marriage, of, enki, and, ninhursag, above, which, seems, an, etiological, myth, of, the, fertilisation, of, the, dry, ground, by, the, coming, of, irrigation, water, from, sumerian, a, ab, water, or, semen, the, early, inscriptions, of, urukagina, in, fact, go, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, the, divine, pair, enki, and, ninki, were, the, progenitors, of, seven, pairs, of, gods, including, enki, as, god, of, eridu, enlil, of, nippur, and, su, en, or, sin, of, ur, and, were, themselves, the, children, of, an, sky, heaven, and, ki, earth, the, pool, of, the, abzu, at, the, front, of, his, temple, was, adopted, also, at, the, temple, to, nanna, akkadian, sin, the, moon, at, ur, and, spread, from, there, throughout, the, middle, east, it, is, believed, to, remain, today, as, the, sacred, pool, at, mosques, or, as, the, holy, water, font, in, catholic, or, eastern, orthodox, churches, whether, eridu, at, one, time, also, played, an, important, political, role, in, sumerian, affairs, is, not, certain, though, not, improbable, at, all, events, the, prominence, of, ea, led, as, in, the, case, of, nippur, to, the, survival, of, eridu, as, a, sacred, city, long, after, it, had, ceased, to, have, any, significance, as, a, political, center, myths, in, which, ea, figures, prominently, have, been, found, in, assurbanipal, s, library, and, in, the, hattusas, archive, in, hittite, anatolia, as, ea, enki, had, a, wide, influence, outside, of, sumer, being, equated, with, el, at, ugarit, and, possibly, yah, at, ebla, in, the, canaanite, ilhm, pantheon, he, is, also, found, in, hurrian, and, hittite, mythology, as, a, god, of, contracts, and, is, particularly, favourable, to, humankind, it, has, been, suggested, that, etymologically, the, name, ea, comes, from, the, term, hyy, life, referring, to, enki, s, waters, as, life, giving, enki, ea, is, essentially, a, god, of, civilization, wisdom, and, culture, he, was, also, the, creator, and, protector, of, man, and, of, the, world, in, general, traces, of, this, version, of, ea, appear, in, the, marduk, epic, celebrating, the, achievements, of, this, god, and, the, close, connection, between, the, ea, cult, at, eridu, and, that, of, marduk, the, correlation, between, the, two, rises, from, two, other, important, connections, 1, that, the, name, of, marduk, s, sanctuary, at, babylon, bears, the, same, name, esaggila, as, that, of, a, temple, in, eridu, and, 2, that, marduk, is, generally, termed, the, son, of, ea, who, derives, his, powers, from, the, voluntary, abdication, of, the, father, in, favour, of, his, son, accordingly, the, incantations, originally, composed, for, the, ea, cult, were, re, edited, by, the, priests, of, babylon, and, adapted, to, the, worship, of, marduk, and, similarly, the, hymns, to, marduk, betray, traces, of, the, transfer, to, marduk, of, attributes, which, originally, belonged, to, ea, it, is, however, as, the, third, figure, in, the, triad, the, two, other, members, of, which, were, anu, and, enlil, that, ea, acquires, his, permanent, place, in, the, pantheon, to, him, was, assigned, the, control, of, the, watery, element, and, in, this, capacity, he, becomes, the, shar, apsi, i, e, king, of, the, apsu, or, the, abyss, the, apsu, was, figured, as, the, abyss, of, water, beneath, the, earth, and, since, the, gathering, place, of, the, dead, known, as, aralu, was, situated, near, the, confines, of, the, apsu, he, was, also, designated, as, en, ki, i, e, lord, of, that, which, is, below, in, contrast, to, anu, who, was, the, lord, of, the, above, or, the, heavens, the, cult, of, ea, extended, throughout, babylonia, and, assyria, we, find, temples, and, shrines, erected, in, his, honour, e, g, at, nippur, girsu, ur, babylon, sippar, and, nineveh, and, the, numerous, epithets, given, to, him, as, well, as, the, various, forms, under, which, the, god, appears, alike, bear, witness, to, the, popularity, which, he, enjoyed, from, the, earliest, to, the, latest, period, of, babylonian, assyrian, history, the, consort, of, ea, known, as, ninhursag, ki, uriash, damkina, lady, of, that, which, is, below, or, damgalnunna, big, lady, of, the, waters, originally, was, fully, equal, with, ea, but, in, more, patriarchal, assyrian, and, neo, babylonian, times, plays, a, part, merely, in, association, with, her, lord, generally, however, enki, seems, to, be, a, reflection, of, pre, patriarchal, times, in, which, relations, between, the, sexes, were, characterised, by, a, situation, of, greater, gender, equality, in, his, character, he, prefers, persuasion, to, conflict, which, he, seeks, to, avoid, if, possible, in, 1964, a, team, of, italian, archaeologists, under, the, direction, of, paolo, matthiae, of, the, university, of, rome, la, sapienza, performed, a, series, of, excavations, of, material, from, the, third, millennium, bce, city, of, ebla, much, of, the, written, material, found, in, these, digs, was, later, translated, by, giovanni, pettinato, among, other, conclusions, he, found, a, tendency, among, the, inhabitants, of, ebla, after, the, reign, of, sargon, of, akkad, to, replace, the, name, of, el, king, of, the, gods, of, the, canaanite, pantheon, found, in, names, such, as, mikael, and, ishmael, with, ia, mikaia, ishmaia, jean, bott, ro, 1952, and, others, suggested, that, ia, in, this, case, is, a, west, semitic, canaanite, way, of, pronouncing, the, akkadian, name, ea, scholars, largely, reject, the, theory, identifying, this, ia, with, the, israelite, theonym, yhwh, while, explaining, how, it, might, have, been, misinterpreted, ia, has, also, been, compared, by, william, hallo, with, the, ugaritic, god, yamm, sea, also, called, judge, nahar, or, judge, river, whose, earlier, name, in, at, least, one, ancient, source, was, yaw, or, ya, a, ea, was, also, known, as, dagon, and, uanna, grecised, oannes, the, first,
