brahma, sanskrit, iast, brahm, is, a, hindu, god, referred, to, as, the, creator, within, the, trimurti, the, trinity, of, supreme, divinity, that, includes, vishnu, and, shiva, he, is, associated, with, creation, knowledge, and, the, vedas, brahma, is, prominently, mentioned, in, creation, legends, in, some, puranas, he, created, himself, in, a, golden, embryo, known, as, the, hiranyagarbha, brahma, is, frequently, identified, with, the, vedic, god, prajapati, during, the, post, vedic, period, brahma, was, a, prominent, deity, and, his, sect, existed, however, by, the, 7th, century, he, had, lost, his, significance, he, was, also, overshadowed, by, other, major, deities, like, vishnu, shiva, and, mahadevi, and, demoted, to, the, role, of, a, secondary, creator, who, was, created, by, the, major, deities, brahma, is, commonly, depicted, as, a, red, or, golden, complexioned, bearded, man, with, four, heads, and, hands, his, four, heads, represent, the, four, vedas, and, are, pointed, to, the, four, cardinal, directions, he, is, seated, on, a, lotus, and, his, vahana, mount, is, a, hamsa, swan, goose, or, crane, according, to, the, scriptures, brahma, created, his, children, from, his, mind, and, thus, they, are, referred, to, as, manasaputra, in, contemporary, hinduism, brahma, does, not, enjoy, popular, worship, and, has, substantially, less, importance, than, the, other, two, members, of, the, trimurti, brahma, is, revered, in, the, ancient, texts, yet, rarely, worshipped, as, a, primary, deity, in, india, owing, to, the, absence, of, any, significant, sect, dedicated, to, his, reverence, few, temples, dedicated, to, him, exist, in, india, the, most, famous, being, the, brahma, temple, pushkar, in, rajasthan, some, brahma, temples, are, found, outside, india, such, as, at, the, erawan, shrine, in, bangkok, which, in, turn, has, found, immense, popularity, within, the, thai, buddhist, community, the, origins, of, the, term, brahm, are, uncertain, partly, because, several, related, words, are, found, in, the, vedic, literature, such, as, brahman, for, the, ultimate, reality, and, br, hma, a, for, priest, a, distinction, between, the, spiritual, concept, of, brahman, and, the, deity, brahm, is, that, the, former, is, a, genderless, abstract, metaphysical, concept, in, hinduism, while, the, latter, is, one, of, the, many, masculine, gods, in, hindu, tradition, the, spiritual, concept, of, brahman, is, quite, old, and, some, scholars, suggest, that, the, deity, brahma, may, have, emerged, as, a, personification, and, visible, icon, of, the, impersonal, universal, principle, of, brahman, the, existence, of, a, distinct, deity, named, brahma, is, evidenced, in, late, vedic, texts, grammatically, the, nominal, stem, brahma, has, two, distinct, forms, the, neuter, noun, br, hman, whose, nominative, singular, form, is, brahma, and, the, masculine, noun, brahm, n, whose, nominative, singular, form, is, brahm, the, former, the, neuter, form, has, a, generalized, and, abstract, meaning, while, the, latter, the, masculine, form, is, used, as, the, proper, name, of, the, deity, brahma, however, brahman, was, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, brahma, s, name, during, the, time, the, mahabharata, was, written, one, of, the, earliest, mentions, of, brahma, with, vishnu, and, shiva, is, in, the, fifth, prapathaka, lesson, of, the, maitrayaniya, upanishad, probably, composed, around, the, late, 1st, millennium, bce, brahma, is, first, discussed, in, verse, 5, 1, also, called, the, kutsayana, hymn, and, then, expounded, in, verse, 5, 2, in, the, pantheistic, kutsayana, hymn, the, upanishad, asserts, that, one, s, soul, is, brahman, and, this, ultimate, reality, cosmic, universal, or, god, is, within, each, living, being, it, equates, the, atman, soul, self, within, to, be, brahma, and, various, alternate, manifestations, of, brahman, as, follows, thou, art, brahma, thou, art, vishnu, thou, art, rudra, shiva, thou, art, agni, varuna, vayu, indra, thou, art, all, in, verse, 5, 2, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, are, mapped, into, the, theory, of, gu, a, that, is, qualities, psyche, and, innate, tendencies, the, text, describes, can, be, found, in, all, living, beings, this, chapter, of, the, maitri, upanishad, asserts, that, the, universe, emerged, from, darkness, tamas, first, as, passion, characterized, by, innate, quality, rajas, which, then, refined, and, differentiated, into, purity, and, goodness, sattva, of, these, three, qualities, rajas, are, then, mapped, to, brahma, as, follows, now, then, that, part, of, him, which, belongs, to, tamas, that, o, students, of, sacred, knowledge, brahmacharins, is, this, rudra, that, part, of, him, which, belongs, to, rajas, that, o, students, of, sacred, knowledge, is, this, brahma, that, part, of, him, which, belongs, to, sattva, that, o, students, of, sacred, knowledge, is, this, vishnu, verily, that, one, became, threefold, became, eightfold, elevenfold, twelvefold, into, infinite, fold, this, being, neuter, entered, all, beings, he, became, the, overlord, of, all, beings, that, is, the, atman, soul, self, within, and, without, yea, within, and, without, while, the, maitri, upanishad, maps, brahma, with, one, of, the, elements, of, the, gu, a, theory, of, hinduism, the, text, does, not, depict, him, as, one, of, the, trifunctional, elements, of, the, hindu, trimurti, idea, found, in, later, puranic, literature, during, the, post, vedic, period, brahma, was, a, prominent, deity, and, his, sect, existed, during, the, 2nd, to, 6th, century, ce, early, texts, like, brahmananda, purana, describe, that, there, was, nothing, but, an, eternal, ocean, from, this, a, golden, egg, called, hiranyagarbha, emerged, the, egg, broke, open, and, brahma, who, had, created, himself, within, it, came, into, existence, gaining, the, name, svayambhu, then, he, created, the, universe, the, earth, and, other, things, he, also, created, people, to, populate, and, live, on, his, creation, however, by, the, 7th, century, brahma, lost, his, importance, historians, believe, that, some, of, the, major, reasons, for, brahma, s, downfall, were, the, rise, of, shaivism, and, vaishnavism, their, replacement, of, him, with, shakti, in, the, smarta, tradition, and, the, frequent, attacks, by, buddhists, jains, and, even, by, hindu, followers, of, vaishnavas, and, shaivites, puranic, legends, mention, various, reasons, for, his, downfall, there, are, primarily, two, prominent, versions, of, why, brahma, lost, his, ground, the, first, version, refers, to, the, shiva, purana, where, brahma, and, vishnu, argued, about, who, was, the, greatest, among, them, while, they, debated, they, saw, a, huge, column, of, fire, piercing, through, the, sky, they, decided, to, locate, the, source, and, extent, of, this, column, vishnu, assumed, the, form, of, a, boar, and, journeyed, towards, the, netherworld, and, brahma, mounted, a, goose, and, travelled, towards, the, heavens, vishnu, accepted, his, defeat, declaring, that, he, had, been, unable, to, locate, the, source, however, brahma, recruited, the, ketaki, flower, as, a, false, witness, to, support, his, lie, that, he, had, located, the, source, shiva, emerged, from, the, fire, in, his, bodily, form, and, cut, off, one, of, brahma, s, heads, for, his, dishonesty, proclaiming, that, he, would, no, longer, receive, worship, pleased, with, vishnu, shiva, offered, him, a, high, status, and, an, active, following, dedicated, to, his, worship, the, post, vedic, texts, of, hinduism, offer, multiple, theories, of, cosmogony, many, involving, brahma, these, include, sarga, primary, creation, of, the, universe, and, visarga, secondary, creation, ideas, related, to, the, indian, thought, that, there, are, two, levels, of, reality, one, primary, that, is, unchanging, metaphysical, and, other, secondary, that, is, always, changing, empirical, and, that, all, observed, reality, of, the, latter, is, in, an, endlessly, repeating, cycle, of, existence, that, cosmos, and, life, we, experience, is, continually, created, evolved, dissolved, and, then, re, created, the, primary, creator, is, extensively, discussed, in, vedic, cosmogonies, with, brahman, or, purusha, or, devi, among, the, terms, used, for, the, primary, creator, in, contrast, the, vedic, and, post, vedic, texts, name, different, gods, and, goddesses, as, secondary, creators, often, brahma, in, post, vedic, texts, and, in, some, cases, a, different, god, or, goddess, is, the, secondary, creator, at, the, start, of, each, cosmic, cycle, kalpa, aeon, brahma, is, a, secondary, creator, as, described, in, the, mahabharata, and, puranas, and, among, the, most, studied, and, described, some, texts, suggest, that, brahma, was, born, from, a, lotus, emerging, from, the, navel, of, the, god, vishnu, and, from, brahma, s, wrath, shiva, was, born, in, contrast, the, shiva, focused, puranas, describe, brahma, and, vishnu, to, have, been, created, by, ardhanarishvara, half, shiva, and, half, parvati, or, alternatively, brahma, was, born, from, rudra, or, vishnu, shiva, and, brahma, creating, each, other, cyclically, in, different, aeons, kalpa, yet, others, suggest, the, goddess, devi, created, brahma, and, these, texts, then, state, that, brahma, is, a, secondary, creator, of, the, world, working, respectively, on, their, behalf, brahma, creates, all, the, forms, in, the, universe, but, not, the, primordial, universe, itself, thus, in, most, puranic, texts, brahma, s, creative, activity, depends, on, the, presence, and, power, of, a, higher, god, further, the, medieval, era, texts, of, these, major, theistic, traditions, of, hinduism, assert, that, the, saguna, representation, with, face, and, attributes, brahma, is, vishnu, shiva, or, devi, respectively, in, the, post, vedic, puranic, literature, brahma, creates, but, neither, preserves, nor, destroys, anything, he, is, envisioned, in, some, hindu, texts, to, have, emerged, from, the, metaphysical, brahman, along, with, vishnu, preserver, shiva, destroyer, all, other, deities, matter, and, other, beings, in, theistic, schools, of, hinduism, where, the, deity, brahma, is, described, as, part, of, its, cosmology, he, is, a, mortal, like, all, deities, and, dissolves, into, the, abstract, immortal, brahman, when, the, universe, ends, a, new, cosmic, cycle, kalpa, restarts, in, the, bhagavata, purana, brahma, is, portrayed, several, times, as, the, one, who, rises, from, the, ocean, of, causes, brahma, states, this, purana, emerges, at, the, moment, when, time, and, universe, are, born, inside, a, lotus, rooted, in, the, navel, of, hari, deity, vishnu, whose, praise, is, the, primary, focus, in, the, purana, the, scriptures, assert, that, brahma, is, drowsy, errs, and, is, temporarily, incompetent, as, he, puts, together, the, universe, he, then, becomes, aware, of, his, confusion, and, drowsiness, meditates, as, an, ascetic, then, realizes, hari, in, his, heart, sees, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, universe, and, then, his, creative, powers, are, revived, brahma, states, bhagavata, purana, thereafter, combines, prakriti, nature, matter, and, purusha, spirit, soul, to, create, a, dazzling, variety, of, living, creatures, and, a, tempest, of, causal, nexus, the, bhagavata, purana, thus, attributes, the, creation, of, maya, to, brahma, wherein, he, creates, for, the, sake, of, creation, imbuing, everything, with, both, the, good, and, the, evil, the, material, and, the, spiritual, a, beginning, and, an, end, the, puranas, describe, brahma, as, the, deity, creating, time, they, correlate, human, time, to, brahma, s, time, such, as, a, mah, kalpa, being, a, large, cosmic, period, correlating, to, one, day, and, one, night, in, brahma, s, existence, the, stories, about, brahma, in, various, puranas, are, diverse, and, inconsistent, in, skanda, purana, for, example, goddess, parvati, is, called, the, mother, of, the, universe, and, she, is, credited, with, creating, brahma, gods, and, the, three, worlds, she, is, the, one, states, skanda, purana, who, combined, the, three, gunas, sattva, rajas, and, tamas, into, matter, prakrti, to, create, the, empirically, observed, world, the, vedic, discussion, of, brahma, as, a, rajas, quality, god, expands, in, the, puranic, and, tantric, literature, however, these, texts, state, that, his, wife, saraswati, has, sattva, quality, of, balance, harmony, goodness, purity, holistic, constructive, creative, positive, peaceful, virtuous, thus, complementing, brahma, s, rajas, quality, of, passion, activity, neither, good, nor, bad, and, sometimes, either, action, qua, action, individualizing, driven, dynamic, sangam, literature, mentions, several, hindu, gods, and, vedic, practices, around, ancient, tamilakam, tamilians, considered, the, vedas, as, a, book, of, righteousness, and, used, it, to, perform, yagams, or, velvi, several, kings, have, performed, vedic, sacrifices, and, prayed, various, gods, of, hinduism, several, sangam, texts, mentions, brahma,

the, father, of, the, universe, silappathikaram, also, has, several, mentions, of, brahma, as, the, four, faced, god, brahma, is, traditionally, depicted, with, four, faces, and, four, arms, each, face, of, his, points, to, a, cardinal, direction, his, hands, hold, no, weapons, rather, symbols, of, knowledge, and, creation, in, one, hand, he, holds, the, sacred, texts, of, vedas, in, second, he, holds, mala, symbolizing, time, in, third, he, holds, a, sruva, or, shruk, ladle, symbolizing, means, to, feed, sacrificial, fire, and, in, fourth, a, kamandalu, utensil, with, water, symbolizing, the, means, from, where, all, creation, emits, his, four, mouths, are, credited, with, creating, the, four, vedas, he, is, often, depicted, with, a, white, beard, implying, his, sage, like,
