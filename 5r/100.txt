in, religious, studies, and, folkloristics, folk, religion, traditional, religion, or, vernacular, religion, comprises, various, forms, and, expressions, of, religion, that, are, distinct, from, the, official, doctrines, and, practices, of, organized, religion, the, precise, definition, of, folk, religion, varies, among, scholars, sometimes, also, termed, popular, belief, it, consists, of, ethnic, or, regional, religious, customs, under, the, umbrella, of, a, religion, but, outside, official, doctrine, and, practices, the, term, folk, religion, is, generally, held, to, encompass, two, related, but, separate, subjects, the, first, is, the, religious, dimension, of, folk, culture, or, the, folk, cultural, dimensions, of, religion, the, second, refers, to, the, study, of, syncretism, between, two, cultures, with, different, stages, of, formal, expression, such, as, the, melange, of, african, folk, beliefs, and, roman, catholicism, that, led, to, the, development, of, vodun, and, santer, a, and, similar, mixtures, of, formal, religions, with, folk, cultures, in, china, folk, protestantism, had, its, origins, with, the, taiping, rebellion, chinese, folk, religion, folk, christianity, folk, hinduism, and, folk, islam, are, examples, of, folk, religion, associated, with, major, religions, the, term, is, also, used, especially, by, the, clergy, of, the, faiths, involved, to, describe, the, desire, of, people, who, otherwise, infrequently, attend, religious, worship, do, not, belong, to, a, church, or, similar, religious, society, and, who, have, not, made, a, formal, profession, of, faith, in, a, particular, creed, to, have, religious, weddings, or, funerals, or, among, christians, to, have, their, children, baptised, in, the, concise, oxford, dictionary, of, world, religions, john, bowker, characterized, folk, religion, as, either, religion, which, occurs, in, small, local, communities, which, does, not, adhere, to, the, norms, of, large, systems, or, the, appropriation, of, religious, beliefs, and, practices, at, a, popular, level, don, yoder, argued, that, there, were, five, separate, ways, of, defining, folk, religion, the, first, was, a, perspective, rooted, in, a, cultural, evolutionary, framework, which, understood, folk, religion, as, representing, the, survivals, of, older, forms, of, religion, in, this, it, would, constitute, the, survivals, in, an, official, religious, context, of, beliefs, and, behaviour, inherited, from, earlier, stages, of, the, culture, s, development, this, definition, would, view, folk, religion, in, catholic, europe, as, the, survivals, of, pre, christian, religion, and, the, folk, religion, in, protestant, europe, as, the, survivals, of, medieval, catholicism, the, second, definition, identified, by, yoder, was, the, view, that, folk, religion, represented, the, mixture, of, an, official, religion, with, forms, of, ethnic, religion, this, was, employed, to, explain, the, place, of, folk, religion, in, the, syncretic, belief, systems, of, the, americas, where, christianity, had, blended, with, the, religions, of, indigenous, american, and, african, communities, yoder, s, third, definition, was, that, often, employed, within, folkloristics, which, held, that, folk, religion, was, the, interaction, of, belief, ritual, custom, and, mythology, in, traditional, societies, representing, that, which, was, often, pejoratively, characterised, as, superstition, the, fourth, definition, provided, by, yoder, stated, that, folk, religion, represented, the, folk, interpretation, and, expression, of, religion, noting, that, this, definition, would, not, encompass, beliefs, that, were, largely, unconnected, from, organised, religion, such, as, in, witchcraft, he, therefore, altered, this, definition, by, including, the, concept, of, folk, religiosity, thereby, defining, folk, religion, as, the, deposit, in, culture, of, folk, religiosity, the, full, range, of, folk, attitudes, to, religion, his, fifth, and, final, definition, represented, a, practical, working, definition, that, combined, elements, from, these, various, other, definitions, thus, he, summarized, folk, religion, as, the, totality, of, all, those, views, and, practices, of, religion, that, exist, among, the, people, apart, from, and, alongside, the, strictly, theological, and, liturgical, forms, of, the, official, religion, yoder, described, folk, religion, as, existing, in, a, complex, society, in, relation, to, and, in, tension, with, the, organized, religion, s, of, that, society, its, relatively, unorganized, character, differentiates, it, from, organized, religion, alternately, the, sociologist, of, religion, matthias, zic, varul, defined, folk, religion, as, the, relatively, un, reflected, aspect, of, ordinary, practices, and, beliefs, that, are, oriented, towards, or, productive, of, something, beyond, the, immediate, here, and, now, everyday, transcendence, in, sociology, folk, religion, is, often, contrasted, with, elite, religion, folk, religion, is, defined, as, the, beliefs, practices, rituals, and, symbols, originating, from, sources, other, than, the, religion, s, leadership, folk, religion, in, many, instances, is, tolerated, by, the, religion, s, leadership, although, they, may, consider, it, an, error, a, similar, concept, is, lived, religion, the, study, of, religion, as, practiced, by, believers, the, term, folk, religion, came, to, be, increasingly, rejected, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, by, scholars, seeking, more, precise, terminology, yoder, noted, that, one, problem, with, the, use, of, the, term, folk, religion, was, that, it, did, not, fit, into, the, work, of, those, scholars, who, used, the, term, religion, in, reference, solely, to, organized, religion, he, highlighted, the, example, of, the, prominent, sociologist, of, religion, mile, durkheim, who, insisted, that, religion, was, organized, in, order, to, contrast, it, with, magic, yoder, noted, that, scholars, adopting, these, perspectives, often, preferred, the, term, folk, belief, over, folk, religion, a, second, problem, with, the, use, of, the, term, folk, religion, that, yoder, highlighted, was, that, some, scholars, particularly, those, operating, in, the, sociology, of, religion, used, the, term, as, a, synonym, for, ethnic, religion, which, is, alternately, known, as, national, religion, or, tribal, religion, meaning, a, religion, closely, tied, to, a, particular, ethnic, or, national, group, and, is, thus, contrasted, with, a, universal, religion, which, cuts, across, ethnic, and, national, boundaries, among, the, scholars, to, have, adopted, this, use, of, terminology, are, e, wilbur, bock, the, folklorist, leonard, norman, primiano, argued, that, the, use, of, the, term, folk, religion, as, well, as, related, terms, like, popular, religion, and, unofficial, religion, by, scholars, does, an, extreme, disservice, to, the, forms, of, religiosity, that, scholars, are, examining, because, in, his, opinion, such, terms, are, residualistic, derogatory, he, argued, that, using, such, terminology, implies, that, there, is, a, pure, element, to, religion, which, is, in, some, way, transformed, even, contaminated, by, its, exposure, to, human, communities, as, a, corrective, he, suggested, that, scholars, use, vernacular, religion, as, an, alternative, defining, this, term, primiano, stated, that, vernacular, religion, is, by, definition, religion, as, it, is, lived, as, human, beings, encounter, understand, interpret, and, practice, it, since, religion, inherently, involves, interpretation, it, is, impossible, for, the, religion, of, an, individual, not, to, be, vernacular, kapal, was, critical, of, this, approach, deeming, it, mistaken, and, arguing, that, switching, from, folk, religion, to, vernacular, religion, results, in, the, scholar, picking, up, a, different, selection, of, things, from, the, world, he, cautioned, that, both, terms, carried, an, ideological, and, semantic, load, and, warned, scholars, to, pay, attention, to, the, associations, that, each, word, had, in, europe, the, study, of, folk, religion, emerged, from, the, study, of, religi, se, volkskunde, a, german, term, which, was, used, in, reference, to, the, religious, dimension, of, folk, culture, or, the, folk, cultural, dimension, of, religion, this, term, was, first, employed, by, a, german, lutheran, preacher, paul, drews, in, a, 1901, article, that, he, published, which, was, titled, religi, se, volkskunde, eine, aufgabe, der, praktischen, theologie, this, article, was, designed, to, be, read, by, young, lutheran, preachers, leaving, the, seminary, to, equip, them, for, the, popular, variants, of, lutheranism, that, they, would, encounter, among, their, congregations, and, which, would, differ, from, the, official, doctrinal, lutheranism, that, they, had, been, accustomed, to, although, developing, within, a, religious, environment, the, term, came, to, be, adopted, by, german, academics, in, the, field, of, folkloristics, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, theoretical, studies, of, religi, se, volkskunde, had, been, produced, by, the, folklorists, josef, weigert, werner, boette, and, max, rumpf, all, of, whom, had, focused, on, religiosity, within, german, peasant, communities, over, the, coming, decades, georg, schreiber, established, an, institut, f, r, religi, se, volkskund, in, munich, while, a, similar, department, was, established, in, salzburg, by, hanns, koren, other, prominent, academics, involved, in, the, study, of, the, phenomenon, were, heinrich, schauert, and, rudolf, kriss, the, latter, of, whom, collected, one, of, the, largest, collections, of, folk, religious, art, and, material, culture, in, europe, later, housed, in, munich, s, bayerisches, nationalmuseum, throughout, the, 20th, century, many, studies, were, made, of, folk, religion, in, europe, paying, particular, attention, to, such, subjects, as, pilgrimage, and, the, use, of, shrines, in, the, americas, the, study, of, folk, religion, developed, among, cultural, anthropologists, studying, the, syncretistic, cultures, of, the, caribbean, and, latin, america, the, pioneer, in, this, field, was, robert, redfield, whose, 1930, book, tepoztl, n, a, mexican, village, contrasted, and, examined, the, relationship, between, folk, religion, and, official, religion, in, a, peasant, community, yoder, later, noted, that, although, the, earliest, known, usage, of, the, term, folk, religion, in, the, english, language, was, unknown, it, probably, developed, as, a, translation, of, the, german, volksreligion, one, of, the, earliest, prominent, usages, of, the, term, was, in, the, title, of, joshua, trachtenberg, s, 1939, work, jewish, magic, and, superstition, a, study, in, folk, religion, the, term, also, gained, increasing, usage, within, the, academic, field, of, comparative, religion, appearing, in, the, titles, of, ichiro, hori, s, folk, religion, in, japan, martin, nilsson, s, greek, folk, religion, and, charles, leslie, s, reader, the, anthropology, of, folk, religion, courses, on, the, study, of, folk, religion, came, to, be, taught, at, various, universities, in, the, united, states, such, as, john, messenger, s, at, indiana, university, and, don, yoder, s, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, although, the, subject, of, folk, religion, fell, within, the, remit, of, scholars, operating, in, both, folkloristics, and, religious, studies, by, 1974, yoder, noted, that, u, s, based, academics, in, the, latter, continued, to, largely, ignore, it, instead, focusing, on, the, study, of, theology, and, institutionalised, religion, he, contrasted, this, with, the, situation, in, europe, where, historians, of, religion, had, devoted, much, time, to, studying, folk, religiosity, he, also, lamented, that, many, u, s, based, folklorists, also, neglected, the, subject, of, religion, because, it, did, not, fit, within, the, standard, genre, based, system, for, cataloguing, folklore, chinese, folk, religion, is, one, of, the, labels, used, to, describe, the, collection, of, ethnic, religious, traditions, which, have, historically, comprised, the, predominant, belief, system, in, china, and, among, han, chinese, ethnic, groups, up, to, the, present, day, the, devotion, includes, the, veneration, of, forces, of, nature, and, ancestors, exorcism, of, demonic, forces, and, a, belief, in, the, rational, order, of, nature, balance, in, the, universe, and, reality, that, can, be, influenced, by, human, beings, and, their, rulers, as, well, as, spirits, and, gods, worship, is, devoted, to, a, hierarchy, of, gods, and, immortals, chinese, pinyin, sh, n, who, can, be, deities, of, phenomena, of, human, behaviour, or, progenitors, of, lineages, stories, regarding, some, of, these, gods, are, collected, into, the, body, of, chinese, mythology, by, the, 11th, century, song, period, these, practices, had, been, blended, with, buddhist, ideas, of, karma, one, s, own, doing, and, rebirth, and, taoist, teachings, about, hierarchies, of, deities, to, form, the, popular, religious, system, which, has, lasted, in, many, ways, until, the, present, day, chinese, folk, religion, is, sometimes, categorized, with, taoism, since, over, the, centuries, institutional, taoism, has, been, attempting, to, assimilate, or, administer, local, religions, more, accurately, taoism, emerged, from, and, overlaps, with, folk, religion, and, chinese, philosophy, chinese, folk, religion, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, constituent, part, of, chinese, traditional, religion, but, more, often, the, two, are, regarded, as, synonymous, with, around, 454, million, adherents, or, about, 6, 6, of, the, world, population, chinese, folk, religion, is, one, of, the, major, religious, traditions, in, the, world, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, more, than, 30, of, the, population, follows, chinese, popular, religion, or, taoism, despite, being, heavily, suppressed, during, the, last, two, centuries, from, the, taiping, rebellion, to, the, cultural, revolution, it, is, currently, experiencing, a, modern, revival, in, both, mainland, china, and, taiwan, various, forms, have, received, support, by, the, government, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, such, as, mazuism, in, southern, china, officially, about, 160, million, chinese, people, are, worshippers, of, mazu, huangdi, worship, black, dragon, worship, in, shaanxi, and, cai, shen, worship, the, term, shenism, was, first, published, by, aja, elliot, in, 1955, to, describe, chinese, folk, religion, in, southeast, asia, indigenous, philippine, folk, religions, are, the, distinct, native, religions, of, various, ethnic, groups, in, the, philippines, where, most, follow, belief, systems, in, line, with, animism, generally, these, indigenous, folk, religions, are, referred, to, as, anitism, or, bathalism, some, of, these, beliefs, stem, from, pre, christian, religions, that, were, especially, influenced, by, hinduism, and, were, regarded, by, the, spanish, as, myths, and, superstitions, in, an, effort, to, de, legitimize, legitimate, precolonial, beliefs, by, forcefully, replacing, those, native, beliefs, with, colonial, catholic, christian, myths, and, superstitions, today, some, of, these, precolonial, beliefs, are, still, held, by, filipinos, especially, in, the, provinces, folk, islam, is, an, umbrella, term, used, to, collectively, describe, forms, of, islam, that, incorporate, native, folk, beliefs, and, practices, folk, islam, has, been, described, as, the, islam, of, the, urban, poor, country, people, and, tribes, in, contrast, to, orthodox, or, high, islam, gellner, 1992, sufi, concepts, which, are, found, in, orthodox, islam, as, well, and, perennialism, and, syncretism, are, often, integrated, into, folk, islam, folk, christianity, is, defined, differently, by, various, scholars, christianity, as, most, people, live, it, a, term, used, to, overcome, the, division, of, beliefs, into, mainstream, and, heterodox, christianity, as, impacted, by, superstition, as, practiced, by, certain, geographical, christian, groups, and, christianity, defined, in, cultural, terms, without, reference, to, the, theologies, and, histories, in, one, of, the, first, major, academic, works, on, the, subject, titled, jewish, magic, and, superstition, a, study, in, folk, religion, joshua, trachtenberg, provided, a, definition, of, jewish, folk, religion, as, consisting, of, ideas, and, practices, that, whilst, not, meeting, with, the, approval, of, religious, leaders, enjoyed, wide, popularity, such, that, they, must, be, included, in, what, he, termed, the, field, of, religion, this, included, unorthodox, beliefs, about, demons, and, angels, and, magical, practices, later, studies, have, emphasized, the, significance, of, the, destruction, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, to, the, many, jewish, folk, customs, linked, to, mourning, and, in, particular, to, the, belief, in, hibbut, ha, qever, torture, of, the, grave, a, belief, that, the, dead, are, tortured, in, their, grave, for, three, days, after, burial, by, demons, until, they, remember, their, names, this, idea, began, with, early, eschatological, aggadah, and, was, then, further, developed, by, the, kabbalists, raphael, patai, has, been, acknowledged, as, one, of, the, first, to, utilize, anthropology, to, study, jewish, folk, religion, in, particular, he, has, drawn, attention, to, the, important, role, of, the, female, divine, element, which, he, sees, in, the, goddess, asherah, the, shekhinah, the, matronit, and, lilith, writer, stephen, sharot, has, stated, that, jewish, popular, religion, in, common, with, other, forms, of, folk, religion, has, a, focus, on, the, apotropaic, or, thaumaturgical, i, e, it, is, used, to, assist, in, protecting, the, individual, from, sickness, and, misfortune, he, emphasizes, that, while, rabbinical, judaism, dealt, with, orthodox, jewish, ritual, and, halakha, magicians, claimed, to, use, unorthodox, magical, rituals, to, help, people, in, everyday, life, he, points, to, the, example, of, a, relatively, professionalised, type, of, magician, being, the, baal, shem, of, poland, who, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, thrived, with, the, popularity, of, practical, kabbalah, in, the, 18th, century, these, ba, alei, shem, promised, to, use, their, knowledge, of, the, names, of, god, and, the, angels, along, with, exorcism, chiromancy, and, herbal, medicine, to, bring, harm, to, enemies, and, success, in, areas, of, social, life, such, as, marriage, and, childbirth, charles, liebman, has, written, that, the, essence, of, the, folk, religion, of, american, jews, is, their, social, ties, to, one, another, illustrated, by, the, finding, that, religious, practices, that, would, prevent, social, integration, such, as, a, strict, interpretation, of, dietary, laws, and, the, sabbath, have, been, abandoned, whilst, the, practices, that, are, followed, such, as, the, passover, seder, social, rites, of, passage, and, the, high, holy, days, are, ones, that, strengthen, jewish, family, and, community, integration, liebman, described, the, rituals, and, beliefs, of, contemporary, jewish, folk, religion, in, his, works, the, ambivalent, american, jew, 1973, and, american, jewry, identity, and, affiliation, june, mcdaniel, 2007, classifies, hinduism, into, six, major, kinds, and, numerous, minor, kinds, in, order, to, understand, the, expression, of, emotions, among, the, hindus, according, to, mcdaniel, one, of, the, major, kinds, is, folk, hinduism, based, on, local, ethnic, traditions, and, tribal, cults, of, local, deities, and, is, the, oldest, non, literate, system, of, indian, religions, folk, hinduism, involves, worship, of, deities, which, are, not, found, in, hindu, scriptures, it, involves, worship, of, gramadevata, village, deity, kuladevata, household, deity, and, local, deities, it, is, a, folk, religion, polytheist, and, animistic, belief, based, on, locality, these, religions, have, their, own, priests, who, worship, regional, deities, during, the, 19th, century, scholars, had, divided, hinduism, and, brahmanism, brahmanism, was, referred, to, as, an, intellectual, classical, tradition, based, on, sanskrit, scriptures, while, hinduism, was, associated, with, superstitious, folk, tradition, the, folk, tradition, refers, to, the, aspects, of, the, hindu, tradition, that, exist, in, tension, with, the, sanskritic, tradition, based, on, textual, authority, according, to, m, n, srinivas, 1976, folk, hinduism, is, relevant, in, the, urban, context, but, it, is, neglected, in, ethnographic, studies, due, to, its, negative, connotations, with, folk, rural, masses, illiterate, according, to, chris, fuller, 1994, popular, hinduism, is, not, degenerate, textual, hinduism, in, light, of, ethnographic, evidence, although, the, category, of, folk, hinduism, remains, tenuous, according, to, michael, witzel, 1998, the, folk, religion, is, the, religion, of, prakrit, speaking, and, dravidian, speaking, lower, caste, while, the, vedic, hinduism, which, comprises, vedas, and, upanishads, is, the, religion, of, sanskrit, speaking, upper, caste, according, to, asko, parpola, 2015, the, folk, village, hinduism, is, surviving, from, pre, rig, vedic, indo, aryan, times, and, indus, valley, culture
