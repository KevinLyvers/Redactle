animism, from, latin, anima, meaning, breath, spirit, life, is, the, belief, that, objects, places, and, creatures, all, possess, a, distinct, spiritual, essence, animism, perceives, all, things, animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather, systems, human, handiwork, and, in, some, cases, words, as, being, animated, having, agency, and, free, will, animism, is, used, in, anthropology, of, religion, as, a, term, for, the, belief, system, of, many, indigenous, peoples, in, contrast, to, the, relatively, more, recent, development, of, organized, religions, animism, is, a, metaphysical, belief, which, focuses, on, the, supernatural, universe, specifically, on, the, concept, of, the, immaterial, soul, although, each, culture, has, its, own, mythologies, and, rituals, animism, is, said, to, describe, the, most, common, foundational, thread, of, indigenous, peoples, spiritual, or, supernatural, perspectives, the, animistic, perspective, is, so, widely, held, and, inherent, to, most, indigenous, peoples, that, they, often, do, not, even, have, a, word, in, their, languages, that, corresponds, to, animism, or, even, religion, the, term, animism, is, an, anthropological, construct, largely, due, to, such, ethnolinguistic, and, cultural, discrepancies, opinions, differ, on, whether, animism, refers, to, an, ancestral, mode, of, experience, common, to, indigenous, peoples, around, the, world, or, to, a, full, fledged, religion, in, its, own, right, the, currently, accepted, definition, of, animism, was, only, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, 1871, by, edward, tylor, it, is, one, of, anthropology, s, earliest, concepts, if, not, the, first, animism, encompasses, beliefs, that, all, material, phenomena, have, agency, that, there, exists, no, categorical, distinction, between, the, spiritual, and, physical, world, and, that, soul, spirit, or, sentience, exists, not, only, in, humans, but, also, in, other, animals, plants, rocks, geographic, features, such, as, mountains, and, rivers, and, other, entities, of, the, natural, environment, examples, include, water, sprites, vegetation, deities, and, tree, spirits, among, others, animism, may, further, attribute, a, life, force, to, abstract, concepts, such, as, words, true, names, or, metaphors, in, mythology, some, members, of, the, non, tribal, world, also, consider, themselves, animists, such, as, author, daniel, quinn, sculptor, lawson, oyekan, and, many, contemporary, pagans, english, anthropologist, sir, edward, tylor, initially, wanted, to, describe, the, phenomenon, as, spiritualism, but, he, realized, that, it, would, cause, confusion, with, the, modern, religion, of, spiritualism, which, was, then, prevalent, across, western, nations, he, adopted, the, term, animism, from, the, writings, of, german, scientist, georg, ernst, stahl, who, had, developed, the, term, animismus, in, 1708, as, a, biological, theory, that, souls, formed, the, vital, principle, and, that, the, normal, phenomena, of, life, and, the, abnormal, phenomena, of, disease, could, be, traced, to, spiritual, causes, the, origin, of, the, word, comes, from, the, latin, word, anima, which, means, life, or, soul, the, first, known, usage, in, english, appeared, in, 1819, earlier, anthropological, perspectives, which, have, since, been, termed, the, old, animism, were, concerned, with, knowledge, on, what, is, alive, and, what, factors, make, something, alive, the, old, animism, assumed, that, animists, were, individuals, who, were, unable, to, understand, the, difference, between, persons, and, things, critics, of, the, old, animism, have, accused, it, of, preserving, colonialist, and, dualistic, worldviews, and, rhetoric, the, idea, of, animism, was, developed, by, anthropologist, sir, edward, tylor, through, his, 1871, book, primitive, culture, in, which, he, defined, it, as, the, general, doctrine, of, souls, and, other, spiritual, beings, in, general, according, to, tylor, animism, often, includes, an, idea, of, pervading, life, and, will, in, nature, a, belief, that, natural, objects, other, than, humans, have, souls, this, formulation, was, little, different, from, that, proposed, by, auguste, comte, as, fetishism, but, the, terms, now, have, distinct, meanings, for, tylor, animism, represented, the, earliest, form, of, religion, being, situated, within, an, evolutionary, framework, of, religion, that, has, developed, in, stages, and, which, will, ultimately, lead, to, humanity, rejecting, religion, altogether, in, favor, of, scientific, rationality, thus, for, tylor, animism, was, fundamentally, seen, as, a, mistake, a, basic, error, from, which, all, religions, grew, he, did, not, believe, that, animism, was, inherently, illogical, but, he, suggested, that, it, arose, from, early, humans, dreams, and, visions, and, thus, was, a, rational, system, however, it, was, based, on, erroneous, unscientific, observations, about, the, nature, of, reality, stringer, notes, that, his, reading, of, primitive, culture, led, him, to, believe, that, tylor, was, far, more, sympathetic, in, regard, to, primitive, populations, than, many, of, his, contemporaries, and, that, tylor, expressed, no, belief, that, there, was, any, difference, between, the, intellectual, capabilities, of, savage, people, and, westerners, the, idea, that, there, had, once, been, one, universal, form, of, primitive, religion, whether, labelled, animism, totemism, or, shamanism, has, been, dismissed, as, unsophisticated, and, erroneous, by, archaeologist, timothy, insoll, who, stated, that, it, removes, complexity, a, precondition, of, religion, now, in, all, its, variants, tylor, s, definition, of, animism, was, part, of, a, growing, international, debate, on, the, nature, of, primitive, society, by, lawyers, theologians, and, philologists, the, debate, defined, the, field, of, research, of, a, new, science, anthropology, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, an, orthodoxy, on, primitive, society, had, emerged, but, few, anthropologists, still, would, accept, that, definition, the, 19th, century, armchair, anthropologists, argued, that, primitive, society, an, evolutionary, category, was, ordered, by, kinship, and, divided, into, exogamous, descent, groups, related, by, a, series, of, marriage, exchanges, their, religion, was, animism, the, belief, that, natural, species, and, objects, had, souls, with, the, development, of, private, property, the, descent, groups, were, displaced, by, the, emergence, of, the, territorial, state, these, rituals, and, beliefs, eventually, evolved, over, time, into, the, vast, array, of, developed, religions, according, to, tylor, as, society, became, more, scientifically, advanced, fewer, members, of, that, society, would, believe, in, animism, however, any, remnant, ideologies, of, souls, or, spirits, to, tylor, represented, survivals, of, the, original, animism, of, early, humanity, the, term, clearly, began, as, an, expression, of, a, nest, of, insulting, approaches, to, indigenous, peoples, and, the, earliest, putatively, religious, humans, it, was, and, sometimes, remains, a, colonialist, slur, graham, harvey, 2005, in, 1869, three, years, after, tylor, proposed, his, definition, of, animism, edinburgh, lawyer, john, ferguson, mclennan, argued, that, the, animistic, thinking, evident, in, fetishism, gave, rise, to, a, religion, he, named, totemism, primitive, people, believed, he, argued, that, they, were, descended, from, the, same, species, as, their, totemic, animal, subsequent, debate, by, the, armchair, anthropologists, including, j, j, bachofen, mile, durkheim, and, sigmund, freud, remained, focused, on, totemism, rather, than, animism, with, few, directly, challenging, tylor, s, definition, anthropologists, have, commonly, avoided, the, issue, of, animism, and, even, the, term, itself, rather, than, revisit, this, prevalent, notion, in, light, of, their, new, and, rich, ethnographies, according, to, anthropologist, tim, ingold, animism, shares, similarities, with, totemism, but, differs, in, its, focus, on, individual, spirit, beings, which, help, to, perpetuate, life, whereas, totemism, more, typically, holds, that, there, is, a, primary, source, such, as, the, land, itself, or, the, ancestors, who, provide, the, basis, to, life, certain, indigenous, religious, groups, such, as, the, australian, aboriginals, are, more, typically, totemic, in, their, worldview, whereas, others, like, the, inuit, are, more, typically, animistic, from, his, studies, into, child, development, jean, piaget, suggested, that, children, were, born, with, an, innate, animist, worldview, in, which, they, anthropomorphized, inanimate, objects, and, that, it, was, only, later, that, they, grew, out, of, this, belief, conversely, from, her, ethnographic, research, margaret, mead, argued, the, opposite, believing, that, children, were, not, born, with, an, animist, worldview, but, that, they, became, acculturated, to, such, beliefs, as, they, were, educated, by, their, society, stewart, guthrie, saw, animism, or, attribution, as, he, preferred, it, as, an, evolutionary, strategy, to, aid, survival, he, argued, that, both, humans, and, other, animal, species, view, inanimate, objects, as, potentially, alive, as, a, means, of, being, constantly, on, guard, against, potential, threats, his, suggested, explanation, however, did, not, deal, with, the, question, of, why, such, a, belief, became, central, to, the, religion, in, 2000, guthrie, suggested, that, the, most, widespread, concept, of, animism, was, that, it, was, the, attribution, of, spirits, to, natural, phenomena, such, as, stones, and, trees, many, anthropologists, ceased, using, the, term, animism, deeming, it, to, be, too, close, to, early, anthropological, theory, and, religious, polemic, however, the, term, had, also, been, claimed, by, religious, groups, namely, indigenous, communities, and, nature, worshippers, who, felt, that, it, aptly, described, their, own, beliefs, and, who, in, some, cases, actively, identified, as, animists, it, was, thus, readopted, by, various, scholars, who, began, using, the, term, in, a, different, way, placing, the, focus, on, knowing, how, to, behave, toward, other, beings, some, of, whom, are, not, human, as, religious, studies, scholar, graham, harvey, stated, while, the, old, animist, definition, had, been, problematic, the, term, animism, was, nevertheless, of, considerable, value, as, a, critical, academic, term, for, a, style, of, religious, and, cultural, relating, to, the, world, the, new, animism, emerged, largely, from, the, publications, of, anthropologist, irving, hallowell, produced, on, the, basis, of, his, ethnographic, research, among, the, ojibwe, communities, of, canada, in, the, mid, 20th, century, for, the, ojibwe, encountered, by, hallowell, personhood, did, not, require, human, likeness, but, rather, humans, were, perceived, as, being, like, other, persons, who, for, instance, included, rock, persons, and, bear, persons, for, the, ojibwe, these, persons, were, each, willful, beings, who, gained, meaning, and, power, through, their, interactions, with, others, through, respectfully, interacting, with, other, persons, they, themselves, learned, to, act, as, a, person, hallowell, s, approach, to, the, understanding, of, ojibwe, personhood, differed, strongly, from, prior, anthropological, concepts, of, animism, he, emphasized, the, need, to, challenge, the, modernist, western, perspectives, of, what, a, person, is, by, entering, into, a, dialogue, with, different, worldwide, views, hallowell, s, approach, influenced, the, work, of, anthropologist, nurit, bird, david, who, produced, a, scholarly, article, reassessing, the, idea, of, animism, in, 1999, seven, comments, from, other, academics, were, provided, in, the, journal, debating, bird, david, s, ideas, more, recently, postmodern, anthropologists, are, increasingly, engaging, with, the, concept, of, animism, modernism, is, characterized, by, a, cartesian, subject, object, dualism, that, divides, the, subjective, from, the, objective, and, culture, from, nature, in, the, modernist, view, animism, is, the, inverse, of, scientism, and, hence, is, deemed, inherently, invalid, by, some, anthropologists, drawing, on, the, work, of, bruno, latour, some, anthropologists, question, modernist, assumptions, and, theorize, that, all, societies, continue, to, animate, the, world, around, them, in, contrast, to, tylor, s, reasoning, however, this, animism, is, considered, to, be, more, than, just, a, remnant, of, primitive, thought, more, specifically, the, animism, of, modernity, is, characterized, by, humanity, s, professional, subcultures, as, in, the, ability, to, treat, the, world, as, a, detached, entity, within, a, delimited, sphere, of, activity, human, beings, continue, to, create, personal, relationships, with, elements, of, the, aforementioned, objective, world, such, as, pets, cars, or, teddy, bears, which, are, recognized, as, subjects, as, such, these, entities, are, approached, as, communicative, subjects, rather, than, the, inert, objects, perceived, by, modernists, these, approaches, aim, to, avoid, the, modernist, assumption, that, the, environment, consists, of, a, physical, world, distinct, from, the, world, of, humans, as, well, as, the, modernist, conception, of, the, person, being, composed, dualistically, of, a, body, and, a, soul, nurit, bird, david, argues, that, positivistic, ideas, about, the, meaning, of, nature, life, and, personhood, misdirected, these, previous, attempts, to, understand, the, local, concepts, classical, theoreticians, it, is, argued, attributed, their, own, modernist, ideas, of, self, to, primitive, peoples, while, asserting, that, the, primitive, peoples, read, their, idea, of, self, into, others, she, explains, that, animism, is, a, relational, epistemology, rather, than, a, failure, of, primitive, reasoning, that, is, self, identity, among, animists, is, based, on, their, relationships, with, others, rather, than, any, distinctive, features, of, the, self, instead, of, focusing, on, the, essentialized, modernist, self, the, individual, persons, are, viewed, as, bundles, of, social, relationships, dividuals, some, of, which, include, superpersons, i, e, non, humans, stewart, guthrie, expressed, criticism, of, bird, david, s, attitude, towards, animism, believing, that, it, promulgated, the, view, that, the, world, is, in, large, measure, whatever, our, local, imagination, makes, it, this, he, felt, would, result, in, anthropology, abandoning, the, scientific, project, like, bird, david, tim, ingold, argues, that, animists, do, not, see, themselves, as, separate, from, their, environment, hunter, gatherers, do, not, as, a, rule, approach, their, environment, as, an, external, world, of, nature, that, has, to, be, grasped, intellectually, indeed, the, separation, of, mind, and, nature, has, no, place, in, their, thought, and, practice, rane, willerslev, extends, the, argument, by, noting, that, animists, reject, this, cartesian, dualism, and, that, the, animist, self, identifies, with, the, world, feeling, at, once, within, and, apart, from, it, so, that, the, two, glide, ceaselessly, in, and, out, of, each, other, in, a, sealed, circuit, the, animist, hunter, is, thus, aware, of, himself, as, a, human, hunter, but, through, mimicry, is, able, to, assume, the, viewpoint, senses, and, sensibilities, of, his, prey, to, be, one, with, it, shamanism, in, this, view, is, an, everyday, attempt, to, influence, spirits, of, ancestors, and, animals, by, mirroring, their, behaviors, as, the, hunter, does, its, prey, cultural, ecologist, and, philosopher, david, abram, proposed, an, ethical, and, ecological, understanding, of, animism, grounded, in, the, phenomenology, of, sensory, experience, in, his, books, the, spell, of, the, sensuous, and, becoming, animal, abram, suggests, that, material, things, are, never, entirely, passive, in, our, direct, perceptual, experience, holding, rather, that, perceived, things, actively, solicit, our, attention, or, call, our, focus, coaxing, the, perceiving, body, into, an, ongoing, participation, with, those, things, in, the, absence, of, intervening, technologies, he, suggests, that, sensory, experience, is, inherently, animistic, in, that, it, discloses, a, material, field, that, is, animate, and, self, organizing, from, the, beginning, david, abram, used, contemporary, cognitive, and, natural, science, as, well, as, the, perspectival, worldviews, of, diverse, indigenous, oral, cultures, to, propose, a, richly, pluralist, and, story, based, cosmology, in, which, matter, is, alive, he, suggested, that, such, a, relational, ontology, is, in, close, accord, with, humanity, s, spontaneous, perceptual, experience, by, drawing, attention, to, the, senses, and, to, the, primacy, of, sensuous, terrain, enjoining, a, more, respectful, and, ethical, relation, to, the, more, than, human, community, of, animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters, and, weather, patterns, that, materially, sustains, humanity, in, contrast, to, a, long, standing, tendency, in, the, western, social, sciences, which, commonly, provide, rational, explanations, of, animistic, experience, abram, develops, an, animistic, account, of, reason, itself, he, holds, that, civilised, reason, is, sustained, only, by, intensely, animistic, participation, between, human, beings, and, their, own, written, signs, for, instance, as, soon, as, someone, reads, letters, on, a, page, or, screen, they, can, see, what, it, says, the, letters, speak, as, much, as, nature, spoke, to, pre, literate, peoples, reading, can, usefully, be, understood, as, an, intensely, concentrated, form, of, animism, one, that, effectively, eclipses, all, of, the, other, older, more, spontaneous, forms, of, animistic, participation, in, which, humans, were, once, engaged, to, tell, the, story, in, this, manner, to, provide, an, animistic, account, of, reason, rather, than, the, other, way, around, is, to, imply, that, animism, is, the, wider, and, more, inclusive, term, and, that, oral, mimetic, modes, of, experience, still, underlie, and, support, all, our, literate, and, technological, modes, of, reflection, when, reflection, s, rootedness, in, such, bodily, participatory, modes, of, experience, is, entirely, unacknowledged, or, unconscious, reflective, reason, becomes, dysfunctional, unintentionally, destroying, the, corporeal, sensuous, world, that, sustains, it, religious, studies, scholar, graham, harvey, defined, animism, as, the, belief, that, the, world, is, full, of, persons, only, some, of, whom, are, human, and, that, life, is, always, lived, in, relationship, with, others, he, added, that, it, is, therefore, concerned, with, learning, how, to, be, a, good, person, in, respectful, relationships, with, other, persons, in, his, handbook, of, contemporary, animism, 2013, harvey, identifies, the, animist, perspective, in, line, with, martin, buber, s, i, thou, as, opposed, to, i, it, in, such, harvey, says, the, animist, takes, an, i, thou, approach, to, relating, to, the, world, whereby, objects, and, animals, are, treated, as, a, thou, rather, than, as, an, it, there, is, ongoing, disagreement, and, no, general, consensus, as, to, whether, animism, is, merely, a, singular, broadly, encompassing, religious, belief, or, a, worldview, in, and, of, itself, comprising, many, diverse, mythologies, found, worldwide, in, many, diverse, cultures, this, also, raises, a, controversy, regarding, the, ethical, claims, animism, may, or, may, not, make, whether, animism, ignores, questions, of, ethics, altogether, or, by, endowing, various, non, human, elements, of, nature, with, spirituality, or, personhood, it, in, fact, promotes, a, complex, ecological, ethics, animism, is, not, the, same, as, pantheism, although, the, two, are, sometimes, confused, moreover, some, religions, are, both, pantheistic, and, animistic, one, of, the, main, differences, is, that, while, animists, believe, everything, to, be, spiritual, in, nature, they, do, not, necessarily, see, the, spiritual, nature, of, everything, in, existence, as, being, united, monism, the, way, pantheists, do, as, a, result, animism, puts, more, emphasis, on, the, uniqueness, of, each, individual, soul, in, pantheism, everything, shares, the, same, spiritual, essence, rather, than, having, distinct, spirits, or, souls, for, example, giordano, bruno, equated, the, world, soul, with, god, and, espoused, a, pantheistic, animism, in, many, animistic, world, views, the, human, being, is, often, regarded, as, on, a, roughly, equal, footing, with, other, animals, plants, and, natural, forces, traditional, african, religions, most, religious, traditions, of, sub, saharan, africa, are, basically, a, complex, form, of, animism, with, polytheistic, and, shamanistic, elements, and, ancestor, worship, in, east, africa, the, kerma, culture, display, animistic, elements, similar, to, other, traditional, african, religions, in, contrast, the, later, polytheistic, napatan, and, meroitic, periods, with, displays, of, animals, in, amulets, and, the, esteemed, antiques, of, lions, appear, to, be, an, animistic, culture, rather, than, a, polytheistic, culture, the, kermans, likely, treated, jebel, barkal, as, a, special, sacred, site, and, passed, it, on, to, the, kushites, and,

v, i, the, ima, ni, ei, the, v, nt, plus, the, ashkun, and, tregami, speakers, the, kalash, are, considered, to, be, an, indigenous, people, of, asia, with, their, ancestors, migrating, to, chitral, valley, from, another, location, possibly, further, south, which, the, kalash, call, tsiyam, in, their, folk, songs, and, epics, they, claim, to, descend, from, the, armies, of, alexander, who, were, left, behind, from, his, armed, campaign, though, no, evidence, exists, for, him, to, have, passed, the, area, efn, the, neighbouring, nuristani, people, of, the, adjacent, nuristan, historically, known, as, kafiristan, province, of, afghanistan, once, had, the, same, culture, and, practised, a, faith, very, similar, to, that, of, the, kalash, differing, in, a, few, minor, particulars, the, first, historically, recorded, islamic, invasions, of, their, lands, were, by, the, ghaznavids, in, the, 11th, century, while, they, themselves, are, first, attested, in, 1339, during, timur, s, invasions, nuristan, had, been, forcibly, converted, to, islam, in, 1895, 96, although, some, evidence, has, shown, the, people, continued, to, practice, their, customs, the, kalash, of, chitral, have, maintained, their, own, separate, cultural, traditions, muism, the, native, korean, belief, has, many, animist, aspects, the, various, deities, called, kwisin, are, capable, of, interacting, with, humans, and, causing, problems, if, they, are, not, honoured, appropriately, in, the, indigenous, philippine, folk, religions, pre, colonial, religions, of, philippines, and, philippine, mythology, animism, is, part, of, their, core, beliefs, as, demonstrated, by, the, belief, in, anito, and, bathala, as, well, as, their, conservation, and, veneration, of, sacred, indigenous, philippine, shrines, forests, mountains, and, sacred, grounds, anito, lit, spirit, refers, to, the, various, indigenous, shamanistic, folk, religions, of, the, philippines, led, by, female, or, feminized, male, shamans, known, as, babaylan, it, includes, belief, in, a, spirit, world, existing, alongside, and, interacting, with, the, material, world, as, well, as, the, belief, that, everything, has, a, spirit, from, rocks, and, trees, to, animals, and, humans, to, natural, phenomena, in, indigenous, filipino, belief, the, bathala, is, the, omnipotent, deity, which, was, derived, from, sanskrit, word, for, the, hindu, supreme, deity, bhattara, as, one, of, the, ten, avatars, of, the, hindu, god, vishnu, the, omnipotent, bathala, also, presides, over, the, spirits, of, ancestors, called, anito, anitos, serve, as, intermediaries, between, mortals, and, the, divine, such, as, agni, hindu, who, holds, the, access, to, divine, realms, for, this, reason, they, are, invoked, first, and, are, the, first, to, receive, offerings, regardless, of, the, deity, the, worshipper, wants, to, pray, to, animism, also, has, influences, in, abrahamic, religions, the, old, testament, and, the, wisdom, literature, preach, the, omnipresence, of, god, jeremiah, 23, 24, proverbs, 15, 3, 1, kings, 8, 27, and, god, is, bodily, present, in, the, incarnation, of, his, son, jesus, christ, gospel, of, john, 1, 14, colossians, 2, 9, animism, is, not, peripheral, to, christian, identity, but, is, its, nurturing, home, ground, its, axis, mundi, in, addition, to, the, conceptual, work, the, term, animism, performs, it, provides, insight, into, the, relational, character, and, common, personhood, of, material, existence, with, rising, awareness, of, ecological, preservation, recently, theologians, like, mark, i, wallace, argue, for, animistic, christianity, with, a, biocentric, approach, that, understands, god, being, present, in, all, earthly, objects, such, as, animals, trees, and, rocks, pre, islamic, arab, religion, can, refer, to, the, traditional, polytheistic, animist, and, in, some, rare, cases, shamanistic, religions, of, the, peoples, of, the, arabian, peninsula, the, belief, in, jinn, invisible, entities, akin, to, spirits, in, the, western, sense, dominant, in, the, arab, religious, systems, hardly, fit, the, description, of, animism, in, a, strict, sense, the, jinn, are, considered, to, be, analogous, to, the, human, soul, by, living, lives, like, that, of, humans, but, they, are, not, exactly, like, human, souls, neither, are, they, spirits, of, the, dead, 49, it, is, unclear, if, belief, in, jinn, derived, from, nomadic, or, sedentary, populations, 51, some, modern, pagan, groups, including, eco, pagans, describe, themselves, as, animists, meaning, that, they, respect, the, diverse, community, of, living, beings, and, spirits, with, whom, humans, share, the, world, and, cosmos, the, new, age, movement, commonly, demonstrates, animistic, traits, in, asserting, the, existence, of, nature, spirits, a, shaman, is, a, person, regarded, as, having, access, to, and, influence, in, the, world, of, benevolent, and, malevolent, spirits, who, typically, enters, into, a, trance, state, during, a, ritual, and, practices, divination, and, healing, according, to, mircea, eliade, shamanism, encompasses, the, premise, that, shamans, are, intermediaries, or, messengers, between, the, human, world, and, the, spirit, worlds, shamans, are, said, to, treat, ailments, and, illnesses, by, mending, the, soul, alleviating, traumas, affecting, the, soul, or, spirit, restores, the, physical, body, of, the, individual, to, balance, and, wholeness, the, shaman, also, enters, supernatural, realms, or, dimensions, to, obtain, solutions, to, problems, afflicting, the, community, shamans, may, visit, other, worlds, or, dimensions, to, bring, guidance, to, misguided, souls, and, to, ameliorate, illnesses, of, the, human, soul, caused, by, foreign, elements, the, shaman, operates, primarily, within, the, spiritual, world, which, in, turn, affects, the, human, world, the, restoration, of, balance, results, in, the, elimination, of, the, ailment, abram, however, articulates, a, less, supernatural, and, much, more, ecological, understanding, of, the, shaman, s, role, than, that, propounded, by, eliade, drawing, upon, his, own, field, research, in, indonesia, nepal, and, the, americas, abram, suggests, that, in, animistic, cultures, the, shaman, functions, primarily, as, an, intermediary, between, the, human, community, and, the, more, than, human, community, of, active, agencies, the, local, animals, plants, and, landforms, mountains, rivers, forests, winds, and, weather, patterns, all, of, which, are, felt, to, have, their, own, specific, sentience, hence, the, shaman, s, ability, to, heal, individual, instances, of, disease, or, imbalance, within, the, human, community, is, a, byproduct, of, their, more, continual, practice, of, balancing, the, reciprocity, between, the, human, community, and, the, wider, collective, of, animate, beings, in, which, that, community, is, embedded, animism, entails, the, belief, that, all, living, things, have, a, soul, and, thus, a, central, concern, of, animist, thought, surrounds, how, animals, can, be, eaten, or, otherwise, used, for, humans, subsistence, needs, the, actions, of, non, human, animals, are, viewed, as, intentional, planned, and, purposive, and, they, are, understood, to, be, persons, as, they, are, both, alive, and, communicate, with, others, in, animist, worldviews, non, human, animals, are, understood, to, participate, in, kinship, systems, and, ceremonies, with, humans, as, well, as, having, their, own, kinship, systems, and, ceremonies, graham, harvey, cited, an, example, of, an, animist, understanding, of, animal, behavior, that, occurred, at, a, powwow, held, by, the, conne, river, mi, kmaq, in, 1996, an, eagle, flew, over, the, proceedings, circling, over, the, central, drum, group, the, assembled, participants, called, out, kitpu, eagle, conveying, welcome, to, the, bird, and, expressing, pleasure, at, its, beauty, and, they, later, articulated, the, view, that, the, eagle, s, actions, reflected, its, approval, of, the, event, and, the, mi, kmaq, s, return, to, traditional, spiritual, practices, in, animism, rituals, are, performed, to, maintain, relationships, between, humans, and, spirits, indigenous, peoples, often, perform, these, rituals, to, appease, the, spirits, and, request, their, assistance, during, activities, such, as, hunting, and, healing, in, the, arctic, region, certain, rituals, are, common, before, the, hunt, as, a, means, to, show, respect, for, the, spirits, of, animals, some, animists, also, view, plant, and, fungi, life, as, persons, and, interact, with, them, accordingly, the, most, common, encounter, between, humans, and, these, plant, and, fungi, persons, is, with, the, former, s, collection, of, the, latter, for, food, and, for, animists, this, interaction, typically, has, to, be, carried, out, respectfully, harvey, cited, the, example, of, m, ori, communities, in, new, zealand, who, often, offer, karakia, invocations, to, sweet, potatoes, as, they, dig, up, the, latter, while, doing, so, there, is, an, awareness, of, a, kinship, relationship, between, the, m, ori, and, the, sweet, potatoes, with, both, understood, as, having, arrived, in, aotearoa, together, in, the, same, canoes, in, other, instances, animists, believe, that, interaction, with, plant, and, fungi, persons, can, result, in, the, communication, of, things, unknown, or, even, otherwise, unknowable, among, some, modern, pagans, for, instance, relationships, are, cultivated, with, specific, trees, who, are, understood, to, bestow, knowledge, or, physical, gifts, such, as, flowers, sap, or, wood, that, can, be, used, as, firewood, or, to, fashion, into, a, wand, in, return, these, pagans, give, offerings, to, the, tree, itself, which, can, come, in, the, form, of, libations, of, mead, or, ale, a, drop, of, blood, from, a, finger, or, a, strand, of, wool, various, animistic, cultures, also, comprehend, stones, as, persons, discussing, ethnographic, work, conducted, among, the, ojibwe, harvey, noted, that, their, society, generally, conceived, of, stones, as, being, inanimate, but, with, two, notable, exceptions, the, stones, of, the, bell, rocks, and, those, stones, which, are, situated, beneath, trees, struck, by, lightning, which, were, understood, to, have, become, thunderers, themselves, the, ojibwe, conceived, of, weather, as, being, capable, of, having, personhood, with, storms, being, conceived, of, as, persons, known, as, thunderers, whose, sounds, conveyed, communications, and, who, engaged, in, seasonal, conflict, over, the, lakes, and, forests, throwing, lightning, at, lake, monsters, wind, similarly, can, be, conceived, as, a, person, in, animistic, thought, the, importance, of, place, is, also, a, recurring, element, of, animism, with, some, places, being, understood, to, be, persons, in, their, own, right, animism, can, also, entail, relationships, being, established, with, non, corporeal, spirit, entities, in, the, early, 20th, century, william, mcdougall, defended, a, form, of, animism, in, his, book, body, and, mind, a, history, and, defence, of, animism, 1911, physicist, nick, herbert, has, argued, for, quantum, animism, in, which, the, mind, permeates, the, world, at, every, level, the, quantum, consciousness, assumption, which, amounts, to, a, kind, of, quantum, animism, likewise, asserts, that, consciousness, is, an, integral, part, of, the, physical, world, not, an, emergent, property, of, special, biological, or, computational, systems, since, everything, in, the, world, is, on, some, level, a, quantum, system, this, assumption, requires, that, everything, be, conscious, on, that, level, if, the, world, is, truly, quantum, animated, then, there, is, an, immense, amount, of, invisible, inner, experience, going, on, all, around, us, that, is, presently, inaccessible, to, humans, because, our, own, inner, lives, are, imprisoned, inside, a, small, quantum, system, isolated, deep, in, the, meat, of, an, animal, brain, werner, krieglstein, wrote, regarding, his, quantum, animism, herbert, s, quantum, animism, differs, from, traditional, animism, in, that, it, avoids, assuming, a, dualistic, model, of, mind, and, matter, traditional, dualism, assumes, that, some, kind, of, spirit, inhabits, a, body, and, makes, it, move, a, ghost, in, the, machine, herbert, s, quantum, animism, presents, the, idea, that, every, natural, system, has, an, inner, life, a, conscious, center, from, which, it, directs, and, observes, its, action, in, error, and, loss, a, licence, to, enchantment, ashley, curtis, 2018, has, argued, that, the, cartesian, idea, of, an, experiencing, subject, facing, off, with, an, inert, physical, world, is, incoherent, at, its, very, foundation, and, that, this, incoherence, is, consistent, with, rather, than, belied, by, darwinism, human, reason, and, its, rigorous, extension, in, the, natural, sciences, fits, an, evolutionary, niche, just, as, echolocation, does, for, bats, and, infrared, vision, does, for, pit, vipers, and, is, epistemologically, on, a, par, with, rather, than, superior, to, such, capabilities, the, meaning, or, aliveness, of, the, objects, we, encounter, rocks, trees, rivers, and, other, animals, thus, depends, for, its, validity, not, on, a, detached, cognitive, judgment, but, purely, on, the, quality, of, our, experience, the, animist, experience, or, the, wolf, s, or, raven, s, experience, thus, become, licensed, as, equally, valid, worldviews, to, the, modern, western, scientific, one, they, are, indeed, more, valid, since, they, are, not, plagued, with, the, incoherence, that, inevitably, arises, when, objective, existence, is, separated, from, subjective, experience, harvey, opined, that, animism, s, views, on, personhood, represented, a, radical, challenge, to, the, dominant, perspectives, of, modernity, because, it, accords, intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language, and, desire, to, non, humans, similarly, it, challenges, the, view, of, human, uniqueness, that, is, prevalent, in, both, abrahamic, religions, and, western, rationalism, animist, beliefs, can, also, be, expressed, through, artwork, for, instance, among, the, m, ori, communities, of, new, zealand, there, is, an, acknowledgement, that, creating, art, through, carving, wood, or, stone, entails, violence, against, the, wood, or, stone, person, and, that, the, persons, who, are, damaged, therefore, have, to, be, placated, and, respected, during, the, process, any, excess, or, waste, from, the, creation, of, the, artwork, is, returned, to, the, land, while, the, artwork, itself, is, treated, with, particular, respect, harvey, therefore, argued, that, the, creation, of, art, among, the, m, ori, was, not, about, creating, an, inanimate, object, for, display, but, rather, a, transformation, of, different, persons, within, a, relationship, harvey, expressed, the, view, that, animist, worldviews, were, present, in, various, works, of, literature, citing, such, examples, as, the, writings, of, alan, garner, leslie, silko, barbara, kingsolver, alice, walker, daniel, quinn, linda, hogan, david, abram, patricia, grace, chinua, achebe, ursula, le, guin, louise, erdrich, and, marge, piercy, animist, worldviews, have, also, been, identified, in, the, animated, films, of, hayao,
