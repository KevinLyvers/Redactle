text, containing, detailed, descriptions, of, krishna, as, a, personality, is, the, epic, mahabharata, which, depicts, krishna, as, an, incarnation, of, vishnu, krishna, is, central, to, many, of, the, main, stories, of, the, epic, the, eighteen, chapters, of, the, sixth, book, bhishma, parva, of, the, epic, that, constitute, the, bhagavad, gita, contain, the, advice, of, krishna, to, arjuna, on, the, battlefield, during, the, ancient, times, that, the, bhagavad, gita, was, composed, in, krishna, was, widely, seen, as, an, avatar, of, vishnu, rather, than, an, individual, deity, yet, he, was, immensely, powerful, and, almost, everything, in, the, universe, other, than, vishnu, was, somehow, present, in, the, body, of, krishna, krishna, had, no, beginning, or, end, fill, space, and, every, god, but, vishnu, was, seen, as, ultimately, him, including, brahma, storm, gods, sun, gods, bright, gods, light, gods, and, gods, of, ritual, other, forces, also, existed, in, his, body, such, as, hordes, of, varied, creatures, that, included, celestial, serpents, he, is, also, the, essence, of, humanity, the, harivamsa, a, later, appendix, to, the, mahabharata, contains, a, detailed, version, of, krishna, s, childhood, and, youth, the, chandogya, upanishad, verse, iii, xvii, 6, mentions, krishna, in, krishnaya, devakiputraya, as, a, student, of, the, sage, ghora, of, the, angirasa, family, ghora, is, identified, with, neminatha, the, twenty, second, tirthankara, in, jainism, by, some, scholars, this, phrase, which, means, to, krishna, the, son, of, devaki, has, been, mentioned, by, scholars, such, as, max, m, ller, as, a, potential, source, of, fables, and, vedic, lore, about, krishna, in, the, mahabharata, and, other, ancient, literature, only, potential, because, this, verse, could, have, been, interpolated, into, the, text, or, the, krishna, devakiputra, could, be, different, from, the, deity, krishna, these, doubts, are, supported, by, the, fact, that, the, much, later, age, sandilya, bhakti, sutras, a, treatise, on, krishna, cites, later, age, compilations, such, as, the, narayana, upanishad, but, never, cites, this, verse, of, the, chandogya, upanishad, other, scholars, disagree, that, the, krishna, mentioned, along, with, devaki, in, the, ancient, upanishad, is, unrelated, to, the, later, hindu, god, of, the, bhagavad, gita,

lost, to, history, but, was, quoted, in, secondary, literature, by, later, greeks, such, as, arrian, diodorus, and, strabo, according, to, these, texts, megasthenes, mentioned, that, the, sourasenoi, tribe, of, india, who, worshipped, herakles, had, two, major, cities, named, methora, and, kleisobora, and, a, navigable, river, named, the, jobares, according, to, edwin, bryant, a, professor, of, indian, religions, known, for, his, publications, on, krishna, there, is, little, doubt, that, the, sourasenoi, refers, to, the, shurasenas, a, branch, of, the, yadu, dynasty, to, which, krishna, belonged, the, word, herakles, states, bryant, is, likely, a, greek, phonetic, equivalent, of, hari, krishna, as, is, methora, of, mathura, kleisobora, of, krishnapura, and, the, jobares, of, jamuna, later, when, alexander, the, great, launched, his, campaign, in, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, his, associates, recalled, that, the, soldiers, of, porus, were, carrying, an, image, of,

about, tirthankaras, this, inclusion, of, krishna, related, legends, in, ancient, buddhist, and, jaina, literature, suggests, that, krishna, theology, was, existent, and, important, in, the, religious, landscape, observed, by, non, hindu, traditions, of, ancient, india, the, ancient, sanskrit, grammarian, patanjali, in, his, mahabhashya, makes, several, references, to, krishna, and, his,

parva, feeling, that, krishna, deliberately, did, not, put, an, end, to, the, war, in, a, fit, of, rage, and, sorrow, gandhari, said, thou, were, indifferent, to, the, kurus, and, the, pandavas, whilst, they, slew, each, other, therefore, o, govinda, thou, shalt, be, the, slayer, of, thy, own, kinsmen, according, to, the, mahabharata, a, fight, breaks, out, at, a, festival, among, the, yadavas, who, end, up, killing, each, other, mistaking, the, sleeping, krishna, for, a, deer, a, hunter, named, jara, shoots, an, arrow, towards, krishna, s, foot, that, fatally, injures, him, krishna, forgives, jara, and, dies, the, pilgrimage, tirtha, site, of, bhalka, in, gujarat, marks, the, location, where, krishna, is, believed, to, have, died, it, is, also, known, as, dehotsarga, states, diana, l, eck, a, term, that, literally, means, the, place, where, krishna, gave, up, his, body, the, bhagavata, purana, in, book, 11, chapter, 31, states, that, after, his, death, krishna, returned, to, his, transcendent, abode, directly, because, of, his, yogic, concentration, waiting, gods, such, as, brahma, and, indra, were, unable, to, trace, the, path, krishna, took, to, leave, his, human, incarnation, and, return, to, his, abode, there, are, numerous, versions, of, krishna, s, life, story, of, which, three, are, most, studied, the, harivamsa, the, bhagavata, purana, and, the, vishnu, purana, they, share, the, basic, storyline, but, vary, significantly, in, their, specifics, details, and, styles, the, most, original, composition, the, harivamsa, is, told, in, a, realistic, style, that, describes, krishna, s, life, as, a, poor, herder, but, weaves, in, poetic, and, allusive, fantasy, it, ends, on, a, triumphal, note, not, with, the, death, of, krishna, differing, in, some, details, the, fifth, book, of, the, vishnu, purana, moves, away, from, harivamsa, realism, and, embeds, krishna, in, mystical, terms, and, eulogies, the, vishnu, purana, manuscripts, exist, in, many, versions, the, tenth, and, eleventh, books, of, the, bhagavata, purana, are, widely, considered, to, be, a, poetic, masterpiece, full, of, imagination, and, metaphors, with, no, relation, to, the, realism, of, pastoral, life, found, in, the, harivamsa, krishna, s, life, is, presented, as, a, cosmic, play, lila, where, his, youth, is, set, as, a, princely, life, with, his, foster, father, nanda, portrayed, as, a, king, krishna, s, life, is, closer, to, that, of, a, human, being, in, harivamsa, but, is, a, symbolic, universe, in, the, bhagavata, purana, where, krishna, is, within, the, universe, and, beyond, it, as, well, as, the, universe, itself, always, the, bhagavata, purana, manuscripts, also, exist, in, many, versions, in, numerous, indian, languages, chaitanya, mahaprabhu, is, considered, as, the, incarnation, of, krishna, in, gaudiya, vaishnavism, and, by, the, iskcon, community, the, date, of, krishna, s, birth, is, celebrated, every, year, as, janmashtami, according, to, guy, beck, most, scholars, of, hinduism, and, indian, history, accept, the, historicity, of, krishna, that, he, was, a, real, male, person, whether, human, or, divine, who, lived, on, indian, soil, by, at, least, 1000, bce, and, interacted, with, many, other, historical, persons, within, the, cycles, of, the, epic, and, puranic, histories, yet, beck, also, notes, that, there, is, an, enormous, number, of, contradictions, and, discrepancies, surrounding, the, chronology, of, krishna, s, life, as, depicted, in, the, sanskrit, canon, some, scholars, believe, that, among, others, the, detailed, description, of, krishna, s, peace, mission, in, the, 5th, book, of, the, mahabharata, udyogaparvan, is, likely, to, be, based, on, real, events, the, epic, s, translator, j, a, b, van, buitenen, in, this, context, assumes, that, there, was, some, degree, of, verisimilitude, in, the, mahabharata, s, depictions, of, life, a, wide, range, of, theological, and, philosophical, ideas, are, presented, through, krishna, in, hindu, texts, the, teachings, of, the, bhagavad, gita, can, be, considered, according, to, friedhelm, hardy, as, the, first, krishnaite, system, of, theology, ramanuja, a, hindu, theologian, and, philosopher, whose, works, were, influential, in, bhakti, movement, presented, him, in, terms, of, qualified, monism, or, nondualism, namely, vishishtadvaita, school, madhvacharya, a, philosopher, whose, works, led, to, the, founding, of, haridasa, tradition, of, vaishnavism, presented, krishna, in, the, framework, of, dualism, dvaita, bhedabheda, a, group, of, schools, which, teaches, that, the, individual, self, is, both, different, and, not, different, from, the, ultimate, reality, predates, the, positions, of, monism, and, dualism, among, medieval, bhedabheda, thinkers, are, nimbarkacharya, who, founded, the, kumara, sampradaya, dvaitadvaita, philosophical, school, and, jiva, goswami, a, saint, from, gaudiya, vaishnava, school, who, described, krishna, theology, in, terms, of, bhakti, yoga, and, achintya, bheda, abheda, krishna, theology, is, presented, in, a, pure, monism, shuddhadvaita, framework, by, vallabha, acharya, the, founder, of, pushti, sect, of, vaishnavism, madhusudana, sarasvati, an, india, philosopher, presented, krishna, theology, in, nondualism, monism, framework, advaita, vedanta, while, adi, shankara, credited, with, unifying, and, establishing, the, main, currents, of, thought, in, hinduism, mentioned, krishna, in, his, early, eighth, century, discussions, on, panchayatana, puja, the, bhagavata, purana, synthesizes, an, advaita, samkhya, and, yoga, framework, for, krishna, but, it, does, so, through, loving, devotion, to, krishna, bryant, describes, the, synthesis, of, ideas, in, bhagavata, purana, as, the, philosophy, of, the, bhagavata, is, a, mixture, of, vedanta, terminology, samkhyan, metaphysics, and, devotionalized, yoga, praxis, the, tenth, book, promotes, krishna, as, the, highest, absolute, personal, aspect, of, godhead, the, personality, behind, the, term, ishvara, and, the, ultimate, aspect, of, brahman, while, sheridan, and, pintchman, both, affirm, bryant, s, view, the, latter, adds, that, the, vedantic, view, emphasized, in, the, bhagavata, is, non, dualist, with, a, difference, in, conventional, nondual, vedanta, all, reality, is, interconnected, and, one, the, bhagavata, posits, that, the, reality, is, interconnected, and, plural, across, the, various, theologies, and, philosophies, the, common, theme, presents, krishna, as, the, essence, and, symbol, of, divine, love, with, human, life, and, love, as, a, reflection, of, the, divine, the, longing, and, love, filled, legends, of, krishna, and, the, gopis, his, playful, pranks, as, a, baby, as, well, as, his, later, dialogues, with, other, figures, are, philosophically, treated, as, metaphors, for, the, human, longing, for, the, divine, and, for, meaning, and, the, play, between, the, universals, and, the, human, soul, krishna, s, lila, is, a, theology, of, love, play, according, to, john, koller, love, is, presented, not, simply, as, a, means, to, salvation, it, is, the, highest, life, human, love, is, god, s, love, other, texts, that, include, krishna, such, as, the, bhagavad, gita, have, attracted, numerous, bhasya, commentaries, in, the, hindu, traditions, though, only, a, part, of, the, hindu, epic, mahabharata, it, has, functioned, as, an, independent, spiritual, guide, it, allegorically, raises, the, ethical, and, moral, dilemmas, of, human, life, through, krishna, and, arjuna, it, then, presents, a, spectrum, of, answers, addressing, the, ideological, questions, on, human, freedoms, choices, and, responsibilities, towards, self, and, others, this, krishna, dialogue, has, attracted, numerous, interpretations, from, being, a, metaphor, for, inner, human, struggle, that, teaches, non, violence, to, being, a, metaphor, for, outer, human, struggle, that, advocates, a, rejection, of, quietism, and, persecution, madhusudana, sarasvati, known, for, his, contributions, to, classical, advaita, vedanta, was, also, a, devout, follower, of, krishna, and, expressed, his, devotion, in, various, verses, within, his, works, notably, in, his, bhagavad, gita, commentary, bhagavad, gita, gudarthadipika, in, his, works, krishna, is, often, interpreted, as, representing, nirguna, brahman, leading, to, a, transtheistic, understanding, of, deity, where, krishna, symbolizes, the, nondual, self, embodying, being, consciousness, and, bliss, and, the, pure, existence, underlying, all, the, worship, of, krishna, is, part, of, vaishnavism, a, major, tradition, within, hinduism, krishna, is, considered, a, full, avatar, of, vishnu, or, one, with, vishnu, himself, however, the, exact, relationship, between, krishna, and, vishnu, is, complex, and, diverse, with, krishna, of, krishnaite, sampradayas, considered, an, independent, deity, and, supreme, vaishnavas, accept, many, incarnations, of, vishnu, but, krishna, is, particularly, important, their, theologies, are, generally, centered, either, on, vishnu, or, an, avatar, such, as, krishna, as, supreme, the, terms, krishnaism, and, vishnuism, have, sometimes, been, used, to, distinguish, the, two, the, former, implying, that, krishna, is, the, transcendent, supreme, being, some, scholars, as, friedhelm, hardy, do, not, define, krishnaism, as, a, sub, order, or, offshoot, of, vaishnavism, considering, it, a, parallel, and, no, less, ancient, current, of, hinduism, all, vaishnava, traditions, recognise, krishna, as, the, eighth, avatar, of, vishnu, others, identify, krishna, with, vishnu, while, krishnaite, traditions, such, as, gaudiya, vaishnavism, ekasarana, dharma, mahanam, sampraday, nimbarka, sampradaya, and, the, vallabha, sampradaya, regard, krishna, as, the, svayam, bhagavan, the, original, form, of, lord, or, the, same, as, the, concept, of, brahman, in, hinduism, gitagovinda, of, jayadeva, considers, krishna, to, be, the, supreme, lord, while, the, ten, incarnations, are, his, forms, swaminarayan, the, founder, of, the, swaminarayan, sampradaya, also,

and, nine, sets, of, triads, one, of, these, triads, is, krishna, as, the, vasudeva, balarama, as, the, baladeva, and, jarasandha, as, the, prati, vasudeva, in, each, age, of, the, jain, cyclic, time, is, born, a, vasudeva, with, an, elder, brother, termed, the, baladeva, between, the, triads, baladeva, upholds, the, principle, of, non, violence, a, central, idea, of, jainism, the, villain, is, the, prati, vasudeva, who, attempts, to, destroy, the, world, to, save, the, world, vasudeva, krishna, has, to, forsake, the, non, violence, principle, and, kill, the, prati, vasudeva, the, stories, of, these, triads, can, be, found, in, the, harivamsa, purana, 8th, century, ce, of, jinasena, not, be, confused, with, its, namesake, the, addendum, to, mah, bh, rata, and, the, trishashti, shalakapurusha, charita, of, hemachandra, the, story, of, krishna, s, life, in, the, puranas, of, jainism, follows, the, same, general, outline, as, those, in, the, hindu, texts, but, in, details, they, are, very, different, they, include, jain, tirthankaras, as, figures, in, the, story, and, generally, are, polemically, critical, of, krishna, unlike, the, versions, found, in, the, mahabharata, the, bhagavata, purana, and, the, vishnu, purana, for, example, krishna, loses, battles, in, the, jain, versions, and, his, gopis, and, his, clan, of, yadavas, die, in, a, fire, created, by, an, ascetic, named, dvaipayana, similarly, after, dying, from, the, hunter, jara, s, arrow, the, jaina, texts, state, krishna, goes, to, the, third, hell, in, jain, cosmology, while, his, brother, is, said, to, go, to, the, sixth, heaven, vimalasuri, is, attributed, to, be, the, author, of, the, jain, version, of, the, harivamsa, purana, but, no, manuscripts, have, been, found, that, confirm, this, it, is, likely, that, later, jain, scholars, probably, jinasena, of, the, 8th, century, wrote, a, complete, version, of, krishna, legends, in, the, jain, tradition, and, credited, it, to, the, ancient, vimalasuri, partial, and, older, versions, of, the, krishna, story, are, available, in, jain, literature, such, as, in, the, antagata, dasao, of, the, svetambara, agama, tradition, in, other, jain, texts, krishna, is, stated, to, be, a, cousin, of, the, twenty, second, tirthankara, neminatha, the, jain, texts, state, that, neminatha, taught, krishna, all, the, wisdom, that, he, later, gave, to, arjuna, in, the, bhagavad, gita, according, to, jeffery, d, long, a, professor, of, religion, known, for, his, publications, on, jainism, this, connection, between, krishna, and, neminatha, has, been, a, historic, reason, for, jains, to, accept, read, and, cite, the, bhagavad, gita, as, a, spiritually, important, text, celebrate, krishna, related, festivals, and, intermingle, with,
