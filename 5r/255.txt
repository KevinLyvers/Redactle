attributed, to, the, buddha, a, wandering, teacher, who, lived, in, the, 6th, or, 5th, century, bce, it, is, the, world, s, fourth, largest, religion, with, over, 520, million, followers, known, as, buddhists, who, comprise, seven, percent, of, the, global, population, buddhism, arose, in, the, eastern, gangetic, plain, as, a, rama, a, movement, in, the, 5th, century, bce, and, gradually, spread, throughout, much, of, asia, it, has, subsequently, played, a, major, role, in, asian, culture, and, spirituality, eventually, spreading, to, the, west, in, the, 20th, century, according, to, tradition, the, buddha, taught, that, attachment, or, clinging, is, the, cause, of, dukkha, often, translated, as, suffering, or, unease, but, that, there, is, a, path, of, development, which, leads, to, awakening, and, full, liberation, from, dukkha, this, path, employs, meditation, practices, and, ethical, precepts, rooted, in, non, harming, with, the, buddha, regarding, it, as, the, middle, way, between, extremes, such, as, asceticism, or, sensual, indulgence, widely, observed, teachings, include, the, four, noble, truths, the, eightfold, noble, path, and, the, doctrines, of, dependent, origination, karma, and, the, three, marks, of, existence, other, commonly, observed, elements, include, the, triple, gem, the, taking, of, monastic, vows, and, the, cultivation, of, perfections, p, ramit, buddhist, schools, vary, in, their, interpretation, of, the, paths, to, liberation, m, rga, as, well, as, the, relative, importance, and, canonicity, assigned, to, various, buddhist, texts, and, their, specific, teachings, and, practices, two, major, extant, branches, of, buddhism, are, generally, recognized, by, scholars, therav, da, lit, school, of, the, elders, and, mah, y, na, lit, great, vehicle, the, theravada, tradition, emphasizes, the, attainment, of, nirv, a, lit, extinguishing, as, a, means, of, transcending, the, individual, self, and, ending, the, cycle, of, death, and, rebirth, sa, s, ra, while, the, mahayana, tradition, emphasizes, the, bodhisattva, ideal, in, which, one, works, for, the, liberation, of, all, sentient, beings, additionally, vajray, na, lit, indestructible, vehicle, a, body, of, teachings, incorporating, esoteric, tantric, techniques, may, be, viewed, as, a, separate, branch, or, tradition, within, mah, y, na, the, buddhist, canon, is, vast, with, many, different, textual, collections, in, different, languages, such, as, sanskrit, pali, tibetan, and, chinese, the, therav, da, branch, has, a, widespread, following, in, sri, lanka, as, well, as, in, southeast, asia, namely, myanmar, thailand, laos, and, cambodia, the, mah, y, na, branch, which, includes, the, east, asian, traditions, of, tiantai, chan, pure, land, zen, nichiren, and, tendai, is, predominantly, practised, in, nepal, bhutan, china, malaysia, vietnam, taiwan, korea, and, japan, tibetan, buddhism, a, form, of, vajray, na, is, practised, in, the, himalayan, states, as, well, as, in, mongolia, and, russian, kalmykia, japanese, shingon, also, preserves, the, vajrayana, tradition, as, transmitted, to, china, historically, until, the, early, 2nd, millennium, buddhism, was, widely, practiced, in, the, indian, subcontinent, before, declining, there, it, also, had, a, foothold, to, some, extent, elsewhere, in, asia, namely, afghanistan, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, and, tajikistan, the, names, buddha, dharma, and, bauddha, dharma, come, from, sanskrit, and, respectively, doctrine, of, the, enlightened, one, and, doctrine, of, buddhists, dharmavinaya, comes, from, sanskrit, literally, meaning, doctrines, disciplines, the, buddha, the, awakened, one, was, a, rama, a, who, lived, in, south, asia, c, 6th, or, 5th, century, bce, followers, of, buddhism, called, buddhists, in, english, referred, to, themselves, as, sakyan, s, or, sakyabhiksu, in, ancient, india, buddhist, scholar, donald, s, lopez, asserts, they, also, used, the, term, bauddha, although, scholar, richard, cohen, asserts, that, that, term, was, used, only, by, outsiders, to, describe, buddhists, details, of, the, buddha, s, life, are, mentioned, in, many, early, buddhist, texts, but, are, inconsistent, his, social, background, and, life, details, are, difficult, to, prove, and, the, precise, dates, are, uncertain, although, the, 5th, century, bce, seems, to, be, the, best, estimate, early, texts, have, the, buddha, s, family, name, as, gautama, pali, gotama, while, some, texts, give, siddhartha, as, his, surname, he, was, born, in, lumbini, present, day, nepal, and, grew, up, in, kapilavastu, a, town, in, the, ganges, plain, near, the, modern, nepal, india, border, and, he, spent, his, life, in, what, is, now, modern, bihar, and, uttar, pradesh, some, hagiographic, legends, state, that, his, father, was, a, king, named, suddhodana, his, mother, was, queen, maya, scholars, such, as, richard, gombrich, consider, this, a, dubious, claim, because, a, combination, of, evidence, suggests, he, was, born, in, the, shakya, community, which, was, governed, by, a, small, oligarchy, or, republic, like, council, where, there, were, no, ranks, but, where, seniority, mattered, instead, some, of, the, stories, about, the, buddha, his, life, his, teachings, and, claims, about, the, society, he, grew, up, in, may, have, been, invented, and, interpolated, at, a, later, time, into, the, buddhist, texts, various, details, about, the, buddha, a, background, are, contested, in, modern, scholarship, for, example, buddhist, texts, assert, that, buddha, described, himself, as, a, kshatriya, warrior, class, but, gombrich, writes, that, little, is, known, about, his, father, and, there, is, no, proof, that, his, father, even, knew, the, term, kshatriya, mahavira, whose, teachings, helped, establish, the, ancient, religion, jainism, is, also, claimed, to, be, ksatriya, by, his, early, followers, according, to, early, texts, such, as, the, pali, ariyapariyesan, sutta, the, discourse, on, the, noble, quest, mn, 26, and, its, chinese, parallel, at, m, 204, gautama, was, moved, by, the, suffering, dukkha, of, life, and, death, and, its, endless, repetition, due, to, rebirth, he, thus, set, out, on, a, quest, to, find, liberation, from, suffering, also, known, as, nirvana, early, texts, and, biographies, state, that, gautama, first, studied, under, two, teachers, of, meditation, namely, ra, k, l, ma, sanskrit, arada, kalama, and, uddaka, ramaputta, sanskrit, udraka, ramaputra, learning, meditation, and, philosophy, particularly, the, meditative, attainment, of, the, sphere, of, nothingness, from, the, former, and, the, sphere, of, neither, perception, nor, non, perception, from, the, latter, finding, these, teachings, to, be, insufficient, to, attain, his, goal, he, turned, to, the, practice, of, severe, asceticism, which, included, a, strict, fasting, regime, and, various, forms, of, breath, control, this, too, fell, short, of, attaining, his, goal, and, then, he, turned, to, the, meditative, practice, of, dhyana, he, famously, sat, in, meditation, under, a, ficus, religiosa, tree, now, called, the, bodhi, tree, in, the, town, of, bodh, gaya, and, attained, awakening, bodhi, according, to, various, early, texts, like, the, mah, saccaka, sutta, and, the, sama, aphala, sutta, on, awakening, the, buddha, gained, insight, into, the, workings, of, karma, and, his, former, lives, as, well, as, achieving, the, ending, of, the, mental, defilements, asavas, the, ending, of, suffering, and, the, end, of, rebirth, in, sa, s, ra, this, event, also, brought, certainty, about, the, middle, way, as, the, right, path, of, spiritual, practice, to, end, suffering, as, a, fully, enlightened, buddha, he, attracted, followers, and, founded, a, sangha, monastic, order, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, teaching, the, dharma, he, had, discovered, and, then, died, achieving, final, nirvana, at, the, age, of, 80, in, kushinagar, india, the, buddha, s, teachings, were, propagated, by, his, followers, which, in, the, last, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, became, various, buddhist, schools, of, thought, each, with, its, own, basket, of, texts, containing, different, interpretations, and, authentic, teachings, of, the, buddha, these, over, time, evolved, into, many, traditions, of, which, the, more, well, known, and, widespread, in, the, modern, era, are, theravada, mahayana, and, vajrayana, buddhism, historically, the, roots, of, buddhism, lie, in, the, religious, thought, of, iron, age, india, around, the, middle, of, the, first, millennium, bce, this, was, a, period, of, great, intellectual, ferment, and, socio, cultural, change, known, as, the, second, urbanisation, marked, by, the, growth, of, towns, and, trade, the, composition, of, the, upanishads, and, the, historical, emergence, of, the, rama, a, traditions, new, ideas, developed, both, in, the, vedic, tradition, in, the, form, of, the, upanishads, and, outside, of, the, vedic, tradition, through, the, rama, a, movements, the, term, rama, a, refers, to, several, indian, religious, movements, parallel, to, but, separate, from, the, historical, vedic, religion, including, buddhism, jainism, and, others, such, as, j, vika, several, rama, a, movements, are, known, to, have, existed, in, india, before, the, 6th, century, bce, pre, buddha, pre, mahavira, and, these, influenced, both, the, stika, and, n, stika, traditions, of, indian, philosophy, according, to, martin, wilshire, the, rama, a, tradition, evolved, in, india, over, two, phases, namely, paccekabuddha, and, savaka, phases, the, former, being, the, tradition, of, individual, ascetic, and, the, latter, of, disciples, and, that, buddhism, and, jainism, ultimately, emerged, from, these, brahmanical, and, non, brahmanical, ascetic, groups, shared, and, used, several, similar, ideas, but, the, rama, a, traditions, also, drew, upon, already, established, brahmanical, concepts, and, philosophical, roots, states, wiltshire, to, formulate, their, own, doctrines, brahmanical, motifs, can, be, found, in, the, oldest, buddhist, texts, using, them, to, introduce, and, explain, buddhist, ideas, for, example, prior, to, buddhist, developments, the, brahmanical, tradition, internalised, and, variously, reinterpreted, the, three, vedic, sacrificial, fires, as, concepts, such, as, truth, rite, tranquility, or, restraint, buddhist, texts, also, refer, to, the, three, vedic, sacrificial, fires, reinterpreting, and, explaining, them, as, ethical, conduct, the, rama, a, religions, challenged, and, broke, with, the, brahmanic, tradition, on, core, assumptions, such, as, atman, soul, self, brahman, the, nature, of, afterlife, and, they, rejected, the, authority, of, the, vedas, and, upanishads, buddhism, was, one, among, several, indian, religions, that, did, so, early, buddhist, positions, in, the, theravada, tradition, had, not, established, any, deities, but, were, epistemologically, cautious, rather, than, directly, atheist, later, buddhist, traditions, were, more, influenced, by, the, critique, of, deities, within, hinduism, and, therefore, more, committed, to, a, strongly, atheist, stance, these, developments, were, historic, and, epistemological, as, documented, in, verses, from, ntideva, s, bodhicary, vat, ra, and, supplemented, by, reference, to, suttas, and, j, takas, from, the, pali, canon, the, history, of, indian, buddhism, may, be, divided, into, five, periods, early, buddhism, occasionally, called, pre, sectarian, buddhism, nikaya, buddhism, or, sectarian, buddhism, the, period, of, the, early, buddhist, schools, early, mahayana, buddhism, late, mahayana, and, the, era, of, vajrayana, or, the, tantric, age, according, to, lambert, schmithausen, pre, sectarian, buddhism, is, the, canonical, period, prior, to, the, development, of, different, schools, with, their, different, positions, the, early, buddhist, texts, include, the, four, principal, pali, nik, yas, and, their, parallel, agamas, found, in, the, chinese, canon, together, with, the, main, body, of, monastic, rules, which, survive, in, the, various, versions, of, the, patimokkha, however, these, texts, were, revised, over, time, and, it, is, unclear, what, constitutes, the, earliest, layer, of, buddhist, teachings, one, method, to, obtain, information, on, the, oldest, core, of, buddhism, is, to, compare, the, oldest, extant, versions, of, the, theravadin, p, li, canon, and, other, texts, the, reliability, of, the, early, sources, and, the, possibility, to, draw, out, a, core, of, oldest, teachings, is, a, matter, of, dispute, according, to, vetter, inconsistencies, remain, and, other, methods, must, be, applied, to, resolve, those, inconsistencies, according, to, schmithausen, three, positions, held, by, scholars, of, buddhism, can, be, distinguished, according, to, mitchell, certain, basic, teachings, appear, in, many, places, throughout, the, early, texts, which, has, led, most, scholars, to, conclude, that, gautama, buddha, must, have, taught, something, similar, to, the, four, noble, truths, the, noble, eightfold, path, nirvana, the, three, marks, of, existence, the, five, aggregates, dependent, origination, karma, and, rebirth, according, to, n, ross, reat, all, of, these, doctrines, are, shared, by, the, theravada, pali, texts, and, the, mahasamghika, school, s, listamba, s, tra, a, recent, study, by, bhikkhu, analayo, concludes, that, the, theravada, majjhima, nikaya, and, sarvastivada, madhyama, agama, contain, mostly, the, same, major, doctrines, richard, salomon, in, his, study, of, the, gandharan, texts, which, are, the, earliest, manuscripts, containing, early, discourses, has, confirmed, that, their, teachings, are, consistent, with, non, mahayana, buddhism, which, survives, today, in, the, theravada, school, of, sri, lanka, and, southeast, asia, but, which, in, ancient, times, was, represented, by, eighteen, separate, schools, however, some, scholars, argue, that, critical, analysis, reveals, discrepancies, among, the, various, doctrines, found, in, these, early, texts, which, point, to, alternative, possibilities, for, early, buddhism, the, authenticity, of, certain, teachings, and, doctrines, have, been, questioned, for, example, some, scholars, think, that, karma, was, not, central, to, the, teaching, of, the, historical, buddha, while, other, disagree, with, this, position, likewise, there, is, scholarly, disagreement, on, whether, insight, was, seen, as, liberating, in, early, buddhism, or, whether, it, was, a, later, addition, to, the, practice, of, the, four, jh, nas, scholars, such, as, bronkhorst, also, think, that, the, four, noble, truths, may, not, have, been, formulated, in, earliest, buddhism, and, did, not, serve, in, earliest, buddhism, as, a, description, of, liberating, insight, according, to, vetter, the, description, of, the, buddhist, path, may, initially, have, been, as, simple, as, the, term, the, middle, way, in, time, this, short, description, was, elaborated, resulting, in, the, description, of, the, eightfold, path, according, to, numerous, buddhist, scriptures, soon, after, the, parinirv, a, from, sanskrit, highest, extinguishment, of, gautama, buddha, the, first, buddhist, council, was, held, to, collectively, recite, the, teachings, to, ensure, that, no, errors, occurred, in, oral, transmission, many, modern, scholars, question, the, historicity, of, this, event, however, richard, gombrich, states, that, the, monastic, assembly, recitations, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, likely, began, during, buddha, s, lifetime, and, they, served, a, similar, role, of, codifying, the, teachings, the, so, called, second, buddhist, council, resulted, in, the, first, schism, in, the, sangha, modern, scholars, believe, that, this, was, probably, caused, when, a, group, of, reformists, called, sthaviras, elders, sought, to, modify, the, vinaya, monastic, rule, and, this, caused, a, split, with, the, conservatives, who, rejected, this, change, they, were, called, mah, s, ghikas, while, most, scholars, accept, that, this, happened, at, some, point, there, is, no, agreement, on, the, dating, especially, if, it, dates, to, before, or, after, the, reign, of, ashoka, buddhism, may, have, spread, only, slowly, throughout, india, until, the, time, of, the, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, 304, 232, bce, who, was, a, public, supporter, of, the, religion, the, support, of, a, oka, and, his, descendants, led, to, the, construction, of, more, st, pas, such, as, at, sanchi, and, bharhut, temples, such, as, the, mahabodhi, temple, and, to, its, spread, throughout, the, maurya, empire, and, into, neighbouring, lands, such, as, central, asia, and, to, the, island, of, sri, lanka, during, and, after, the, mauryan, period, 322, 180, bce, the, sthavira, community, gave, rise, to, several, schools, one, of, which, was, the, theravada, school, which, tended, to, congregate, in, the, south, and, another, which, was, the, sarv, stiv, da, school, which, was, mainly, in, north, india, likewise, the, mah, s, ghika, groups, also, eventually, split, into, different, sanghas, originally, these, schisms, were, caused, by, disputes, over, monastic, disciplinary, codes, of, various, fraternities, but, eventually, by, about, 100, ce, if, not, earlier, schisms, were, being, caused, by, doctrinal, disagreements, too, following, or, leading, up, to, the, schisms, each, sa, gha, started, to, accumulate, their, own, version, of, tripi, aka, triple, basket, of, texts, in, their, tripi, aka, each, school, included, the, suttas, of, the, buddha, a, vinaya, basket, disciplinary, code, and, some, schools, also, added, an, abhidharma, basket, which, were, texts, on, detailed, scholastic, classification, summary, and, interpretation, of, the, suttas, the, doctrine, details, in, the, abhidharmas, of, various, buddhist, schools, differ, significantly, and, these, were, composed, starting, about, the, third, century, bce, and, through, the, 1st, millennium, ce, according, to, the, edicts, of, a, oka, the, mauryan, emperor, sent, emissaries, to, various, countries, west, of, india, to, spread, dharma, particularly, in, eastern, provinces, of, the, neighbouring, seleucid, empire, and, even, farther, to, hellenistic, kingdoms, of, the, mediterranean, it, is, a, matter, of, disagreement, among, scholars, whether, or, not, these, emissaries, were, accompanied, by, buddhist, missionaries, in, central, and, west, asia, buddhist, influence, grew, through, greek, speaking, buddhist, monarchs, and, ancient, asian, trade, routes, a, phenomenon, known, as, greco, buddhism, an, example, of, this, is, evidenced, in, chinese, and, pali, buddhist, records, such, as, milindapanha, and, the, greco, buddhist, art, of, gandh, ra, the, milindapanha, describes, a, conversation, between, a, buddhist, monk, and, the, 2nd, century, bce, greek, king, menander, after, which, menander, abdicates, and, himself, goes, into, monastic, life, in, the, pursuit, of, nirvana, some, scholars, have, questioned, the, milindapanha, version, expressing, doubts, whether, menander, was, buddhist, or, just, favourably, disposed, to, buddhist, monks, the, kushan, empire, 30, 375, ce, came, to, control, the, silk, road, trade, through, central, and, south, asia, which, brought, them, to, interact, with, gandharan, buddhism, and, the, buddhist, institutions, of, these, regions, the, kushans, patronised, buddhism, throughout, their, lands, and, many, buddhist, centres, were, built, or, renovated, the, sarvastivada, school, was, particularly, favored, especially, by, emperor, kanishka, 128, 151, ce, kushan, support, helped, buddhism, to, expand, into, a, world, religion, through, their, trade, routes, buddhism, spread, to, khotan, the, tarim, basin, and, china, eventually, to, other, parts, of, the, far, east, some, of, the, earliest, written, documents, of, the, buddhist, faith, are, the, gandharan, buddhist, texts, dating, from, about, the, 1st, century, ce, and, connected, to, the, dharmaguptaka, school, the, islamic, conquest, of, the, iranian, plateau, in, the, 7th, century, followed, by, the, muslim, conquests, of, afghanistan, and, the, later, establishment, of, the, ghaznavid, kingdom, with, islam, as, the, state, religion, in, central, asia, between, the, 10th, and, 12th, century, led, to, the, decline, and, disappearance, of, buddhism, from, most, of, these, regions, the, origins, of, mah, y, na, great, vehicle, buddhism, are, not, well, understood, and, there, are, various, competing, theories, about, how, and, where, this, movement, arose, theories, include, the, idea, that, it, began, as, various, groups, venerating, certain, texts, or, that, it, arose, as, a, strict, forest, ascetic, movement, the, first, mah, y, na, works, were, written, sometime, between, the, 1st, century, bce, and, the, 2nd, century, ce, much, of, the, early, extant, evidence, for, the, origins, of, mah, y, na, comes, from, early, chinese, translations, of, mah, y, na, texts, mainly, those, of, lokak, ema, 2nd, century, ce, some, scholars, have, traditionally, considered, the, earliest, mah, y, na, s, tras, to, include, the, first, versions, of, the, prajnaparamita, series, along, with, texts, concerning, ak, obhya, which, were, probably, composed, in, the, 1st, century, bce, in, the, south, of, india, there, is, no, evidence, that, mah, y, na, ever, referred, to, a, separate, formal, school, or, sect, of, buddhism, with, a, separate, monastic, code, vinaya, but, rather, that, it, existed, as, a, certain, set, of, ideals, and, later, doctrines, for, bodhisattvas, records, written, by, chinese, monks, visiting, india, indicate, that, both, mah, y, na, and, non, mah, y, na, monks, could, be, found, in, the, same, monasteries, with, the, difference, that, mah, y, na, monks, worshipped, figures, of, bodhisattvas, while, non, mahayana, monks, did, not, mah, y, na, initially, seems, to, have, remained, a, small, minority, movement, that, was, in, tension, with, other, buddhist, groups, struggling, for, wider, acceptance, however, during, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, ce, there, seems, to, have, been, a, rapid, growth, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, which, is, shown, by, a, large, increase, in, epigraphic, and, manuscript, evidence, in, this, period, however, it, still, remained, a, minority, in, comparison, to, other, buddhist, schools, mah, y, na, buddhist, institutions, continued, to, grow, in, influence, during, the, following, centuries, with, large, monastic, university, complexes, such, as, nalanda, established, by, the, 5th, century, ce, gupta, emperor, kumaragupta, i, and, vikramashila, established, under, dharmapala, c, 783, to, 820, becoming, quite, powerful, and, influential, during, this, period, of, late, mah, y, na, four, major, types, of, thought, developed, m, dhyamaka, yog, c, ra, buddha, nature, tath, gatagarbha, and, the, epistemological, tradition, of, dignaga, and, dharmakirti, according, to, dan, lusthaus, m, dhyamaka, and, yog, c, ra, have, a, great, deal, in, common, and, the, commonality, stems, from, early, buddhism, during, the, gupta, period, 4th, 6th, centuries, and, the, empire, of, har, avardana, c, 590, 647, ce, buddhism, continued, to, be, influential, in, india, and, large, buddhist, learning, institutions, such, as, nalanda, and, valabahi, universities, were, at, their, peak, buddhism, also, flourished, under, the, support, of, the, p, la, empire, 8th, 12th, centuries, under, the, guptas, and, palas, tantric, buddhism, or, vajrayana, developed, and, rose, to, prominence, it, promoted, new, practices, such, as, the, use, of, mantras, dharanis, mudras, mandalas, and, the, visualization, of, deities, and, buddhas, and, developed, a, new, class, of, literature, the, buddhist, tantras, this, new, esoteric, form, of, buddhism, can, be, traced, back, to, groups, of, wandering, yogi, magicians, called, mahasiddhas, the, question, of, the, origins, of, early, vajrayana, has, been, taken, up, by, various, scholars, david, seyfort, ruegg, has, suggested, that, buddhist, tantra, employed, various, elements, of, a, pan, indian, religious, substrate, which, is, not, specifically, buddhist, shaiva, or, vaishnava, according, to, indologist, alexis, sanderson, various, classes, of, vajrayana, literature, developed, as, a, result, of, royal, courts, sponsoring, both, buddhism, and, saivism, sanderson, has, argued, that, buddhist, tantras, can, be, shown, to, have, borrowed, practices, terms, rituals, and, more, form, shaiva, tantras, he, argues, that, buddhist, texts, even, directly, copied, various, shaiva, tantras, especially, the, bhairava, vidyapitha, tantras, ronald, m, davidson, meanwhile, argues, that, sanderson, s, claims, for, direct, influence, from, shaiva, vidyapitha, texts, are, problematic, because, the, chronology, of, the, vidyapitha, tantras, is, by, no, means, so, well, established, and, that, the, shaiva, tradition, also, appropriated, non, hindu, deities, texts, and, traditions, thus, while, there, can, be, no, question, that, the, buddhist, tantras, were, heavily, influenced, by, kapalika, and, other, saiva, movements, argues, davidson, the, influence, was, apparently, mutual, already, during, this, later, era, buddhism, was, losing, state, support, in, other, regions, of, india, including, the, lands, of, the, karkotas, the, pratiharas, the, rashtrakutas, the, pandyas, and, the, pallavas, this, loss, of, support, in, favor, of, hindu, faiths, like, vaishnavism, and, shaivism, is, the, beginning, of, the, long, and, complex, period, of, the, decline, of, buddhism, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, islamic, invasions, and, conquest, of, india, 10th, to, 12th, century, further, damaged, and, destroyed, many, buddhist, institutions, leading, to, its, eventual, near, disappearance, from, india, by, the, 1200s, the, silk, road, transmission, of, buddhism, to, china, is, most, commonly, thought, to, have, started, in, the, late, 2nd, or, the, 1st, century, ce, though, the, literary, sources, are, all, open, to, question, the, first, documented, translation, efforts, by, foreign, buddhist, monks, in, china, were, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, probably, as, a, consequence, of, the, expansion, of, the, kushan, empire, into, the, chinese, territory, of, the, tarim, basin, the, first, documented, buddhist, texts, translated, into, chinese, are, those, of, the, parthian, an, shigao, 148, 180, ce, the, first, known, mah, y, na, scriptural, texts, are, translations, into, chinese, by, the, kushan, monk, lokak, ema, in, luoyang, between, 178, and, 189, ce, from, china, buddhism, was, introduced, into, its, neighbours, korea, 4th, century, japan, 6th, 7th, centuries, and, vietnam, c, 1st, 2nd, centuries, during, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, chinese, esoteric, buddhism, was, introduced, from, india, and, chan, buddhism, zen, became, a, major, religion, chan, continued, to, grow, in, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, and, it, was, during, this, era, that, it, strongly, influenced, korean, buddhism, and, japanese, buddhism, pure, land, buddhism, also, became, popular, during, this, period, and, was, often, practised, together, with, chan, it, was, also, during, the, song, that, the, entire, chinese, canon, was, printed, using, over, 130, 000, wooden, printing, blocks, during, the, indian, period, of, esoteric, buddhism, from, the, 8th, century, onwards, buddhism, spread, from, india, to, tibet, and, mongolia, johannes, bronkhorst, states, that, the, esoteric, form, was, attractive, because, it, allowed, both, a, secluded, monastic, community, as, well, as, the, social, rites, and, rituals, important, to, laypersons, and, to, kings, for, the, maintenance, of, a, political, state, during, succession, and, wars, to, resist, invasion, during, the, middle, ages, buddhism, slowly, declined, in, india, while, it, vanished, from, persia, and, central, asia, as, islam, became, the, state, religion, the, theravada, school, arrived, in, sri, lanka, sometime, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, sri, lanka, became, a, base, for, its, later, spread, to, southeast, asia, after, the, 5th, century, ce, myanmar, malaysia, indonesia, thailand, cambodia, and, coastal, vietnam, theravada, buddhism, was, the, dominant, religion, in, burma, during, the, mon, hanthawaddy, kingdom, 1287, 1552, it, also, became, dominant, in, the, khmer, empire, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, and, in, the, thai, sukhothai, kingdom, during, the, reign, of, ram, khamhaeng, 1237, 1247, 1298, the, term, buddhism, is, an, occidental, neologism, commonly, and, rather, roughly, according, to, donald, s, lopez, jr, used, as, a, translation, for, the, dharma, of, the, buddha, f, ji, o, in, chinese, bukky, in, japanese, nang, pa, sangs, rgyas, pa, i, chos, in, tibetan, buddhadharma, in, sanskrit, buddha, sana, in, pali, the, four, noble, truths, or, the, truths, of, the, noble, ones, taught, in, buddhism, are, most, schools, of, buddhism, teach, three, marks, of, existence, buddhism, teaches, that, the, idea, that, anything, is, permanent, or, that, there, is, self, in, any, being, is, ignorance, or, misperception, avijj, and, that, this, is, the, primary, source, of, clinging, and, dukkha, some, schools, describe, four, characteristics, or, four, seals, of, the, dharma, adding, to, the, above, sa, s, ra, means, wandering, or, world, with, the, connotation, of, cyclic, circuitous, change, it, refers, to, the, theory, of, rebirth, and, cyclicality, of, all, life, matter, existence, a, fundamental, assumption, of, buddhism, as, with, all, major, indian, religions, samsara, in, buddhism, is, considered, to, be, dukkha, unsatisfactory, and, painful, perpetuated, by, desire, and, avidya, ignorance, and, the, resulting, karma, liberation, from, this, cycle, of, existence, nirvana, has, been, the, foundation, and, the, most, important, historical, justification, of, buddhism, buddhist, texts, assert, that, rebirth, can, occur, in, six, realms, of, existence, namely, three, good, realms, heavenly, demi, god, human, and, three, evil, realms, animal, hungry, ghosts, hellish, samsara, ends, if, a, person, attains, nirvana, the, blowing, out, of, the, afflictions, through, insight, into, impermanence, and, non, self, rebirth, refers, to, a, process, whereby, beings, go, through, a, succession, of, lifetimes, as, one, of, many, possible, forms, of, sentient, life, each, running, from, conception, to, death, in, buddhist, thought, this, rebirth, does, not, involve, a, soul, or, any, fixed, substance, this, is, because, the, buddhist, doctrine, of, anatt, sanskrit, an, tman, no, self, doctrine, rejects, the, concepts, of, a, permanent, self, or, an, unchanging, eternal, soul, found, in, other, religions, the, buddhist, traditions, have, traditionally, disagreed, on, what, it, is, in, a, person, that, is, reborn, as, well, as, how, quickly, the, rebirth, occurs, after, death, some, buddhist, traditions, assert, that, no, self, doctrine, means, that, there, is, no, enduring, self, but, there, is, avacya, inexpressible, personality, pudgala, which, migrates, from, one, life, to, another, the, majority, of, buddhist, traditions, in, contrast, assert, that, vij, na, a, person, s, consciousness, though, evolving, exists, as, a, continuum, and, is, the, mechanistic, basis, of, what, undergoes, the, rebirth, process, the, quality, of, one, s, rebirth, depends, on, the, merit, or, demerit, gained, by, one, s, karma, i, e, actions, as, well, as, that, accrued, on, one, s, behalf, by, a, family, member, buddhism, also, developed, a, complex, cosmology, to, explain, the, various, realms, or, planes, of, rebirth, in, buddhism, karma, from, sanskrit, action, work, drives, sa, s, ra, the, endless, cycle, of, suffering, and, rebirth, for, each, being, good, skilful, deeds, p, li, kusala, and, bad, unskilful, deeds, p, li, akusala, produce, seeds, in, the, unconscious, receptacle, laya, that, mature, later, either, in, this, life, or, in, a, subsequent, rebirth, the, existence, of, karma, is, a, core, belief, in, buddhism, as, with, all, major, indian, religions, and, it, implies, neither, fatalism, nor, that, everything, that, happens, to, a, person, is, caused, by, karma, diseases, and, suffering, induced, by, the, disruptive, actions, of, other, people, are, examples, of, non, karma, suffering, a, central, aspect, of, buddhist, theory, of, karma, is, that, intent, cetan, matters, and, is, essential, to, bring, about, a, consequence, or, phala, fruit, or, vip, ka, result, the, emphasis, on, intent, in, buddhism, marks, a, difference, from, the, karmic, theory, of, jainism, where, karma, accumulates, with, or, without, intent, the, emphasis, on, intent, is, also, found, in, hinduism, and, buddhism, may, have, influenced, karma, theories, of, hinduism, in, buddhism, good, or, bad, karma, accumulates, even, if, there, is, no, physical, action, and, just, having, ill, or, good, thoughts, creates, karmic, seeds, thus, actions, of, body, speech, or, mind, all, lead, to, karmic, seeds, in, the, buddhist, traditions, life, aspects, affected, by, the, law, of, karma, in, past, and, current, births, of, a, being, include, the, form, of, rebirth, realm, of, rebirth, social, class, character, and, major, circumstances, of, a, lifetime, according, to, the, theory, it, operates, like, the, laws, of, physics, without, external, intervention, on, every, being, in, all, six, realms, of, existence, including, human, beings, and, gods, a, notable, aspect, of, the, karma, theory, in, modern, buddhism, is, merit, transfer, a, person, accumulates, merit, not, only, through, intentions, and, ethical, living, but, also, is, able, to, gain, merit, from, others, by, exchanging, goods, and, services, such, as, through, d, na, charity, to, monks, or, nuns, the, theory, also, states, a, person, can, transfer, one, s, own, good, karma, to, living, family, members, and, ancestors, this, buddhist, idea, may, have, roots, in, the, quid, pro, quo, exchange, beliefs, of, the, hindu, vedic, rituals, the, karma, merit, transfer, concept, has, been, controversial, not, accepted, in, later, jainism, and, hinduism, traditions, unlike, buddhism, where, it, was, adopted, in, ancient, times, and, remains, a, common, practice, according, to, bruce, reichenbach, the, merit, transfer, idea, was, generally, absent, in, early, buddhism, and, may, have, emerged, with, the, rise, of, mahayana, buddhism, he, adds, that, while, major, hindu, schools, such, as, yoga, advaita, vedanta, and, others, do, not, believe, in, merit, transfer, some, bhakti, hindu, traditions, later, adopted, the, idea, just, like, buddhism, the, cessation, of, the, kleshas, and, the, attainment, of, nirvana, nibb, na, with, which, the, cycle, of, rebirth, ends, has, been, the, primary, and, the, soteriological, goal, of, the, buddhist, path, for, monastic, life, since, the, time, of, the, buddha, the, term, path, is, usually, taken, to, mean, the, noble, eightfold, path, but, other, versions, of, the, path, can, also, be, found, in, the, nikayas, in, some, passages, in, the, pali, canon, a, distinction, is, being, made, between, right, knowledge, or, insight, samm, a, and, right, liberation, or, release, samm, vimutti, as, the, means, to, attain, cessation, and, liberation, nirvana, literally, means, blowing, out, quenching, becoming, extinguished, in, early, buddhist, texts, it, is, the, state, of, restraint, and, self, control, that, leads, to, the, blowing, out, and, the, ending, of, the, cycles, of, sufferings, associated, with, rebirths, and, redeaths, many, later, buddhist, texts, describe, nirvana, as, identical, with, anatta, with, complete, emptiness, nothingness, in, some, texts, the, state, is, described, with, greater, detail, such, as, passing, through, the, gate, of, emptiness, sunyata, realising, that, there, is, no, soul, or, self, in, any, living, being, then, passing, through, the, gate, of, signlessness, animitta, realising, that, nirvana, cannot, be, perceived, and, finally, passing, through, the, gate, of, wishlessness, apranihita, realising, that, nirvana, is, the, state, of, not, even, wishing, for, nirvana, the, nirvana, state, has, been, described, in, buddhist, texts, partly, in, a, manner, similar, to, other, indian, religions, as, the, state, of, complete, liberation, enlightenment, highest, happiness, bliss, fearlessness, freedom, permanence, non, dependent, origination, unfathomable, and, indescribable, it, has, also, been, described, in, part, differently, as, a, state, of, spiritual, release, marked, by, emptiness, and, realisation, of, non, self, while, buddhism, considers, the, liberation, from, sa, s, ra, as, the, ultimate, spiritual, goal, in, traditional, practice, the, primary, focus, of, a, vast, majority, of, lay, buddhists, has, been, to, seek, and, accumulate, merit, through, good, deeds, donations, to, monks, and, various, buddhist, rituals, in, order, to, gain, better, rebirths, rather, than, nirvana, pratityasamutpada, also, called, dependent, arising, or, dependent, origination, is, the, buddhist, theory, to, explain, the, nature, and, relations, of, being, becoming, existence, and, ultimate, reality, buddhism, asserts, that, there, is, nothing, independent, except, the, state, of, nirvana, all, physical, and, mental, states, depend, on, and, arise, from, other, pre, existing, states, and, in, turn, from, them, arise, other, dependent, states, while, they, cease, the, dependent, arisings, have, a, causal, conditioning, and, thus, pratityasamutpada, is, the, buddhist, belief, that, causality, is, the, basis, of, ontology, not, a, creator, god, nor, the, ontological, vedic, concept, called, universal, self, brahman, nor, any, other, transcendent, creative, principle, however, buddhist, thought, does, not, understand, causality, in, terms, of, newtonian, mechanics, rather, it, understands, it, as, conditioned, arising, in, buddhism, dependent, arising, refers, to, conditions, created, by, a, plurality, of, causes, that, necessarily, co, originate, a, phenomenon, within, and, across, lifetimes, such, as, karma, in, one, life, creating, conditions, that, lead, to, rebirth, in, one, of, the, realms, of, existence, for, another, lifetime, buddhism, applies, the, theory, of, dependent, arising, to, explain, origination, of, endless, cycles, of, dukkha, and, rebirth, through, twelve, nid, nas, or, twelve, links, it, states, that, because, avidy, ignorance, exists, sa, sk, ras, karmic, formations, exist, because, sa, sk, ras, exist, therefore, vij, na, consciousness, exists, and, in, a, similar, manner, it, links, n, mar, pa, the, sentient, body, a, yatana, our, six, senses, spar, a, sensory, stimulation, vedan, feeling, ta, h, craving, up, d, na, grasping, bhava, becoming, j, ti, birth, and, jar, mara, a, old, age, death, sorrow, and, pain, by, breaking, the, circuitous, links, of, the, twelve, nidanas, buddhism, asserts, that, liberation, from, these, endless, cycles, of, rebirth, and, dukkha, can, be, attained, a, related, doctrine, in, buddhism, is, that, of, anatt, pali, or, an, tman, sanskrit, it, is, the, view, that, there, is, no, unchanging, permanent, self, soul, or, essence, in, phenomena, the, buddha, and, buddhist, philosophers, who, follow, him, such, as, vasubandhu, and, buddhaghosa, generally, argue, for, this, view, by, analyzing, the, person, through, the, schema, of, the, five, aggregates, and, then, attempting, to, show, that, none, of, these, five, components, of, personality, can, be, permanent, or, absolute, this, can, be, seen, in, buddhist, discourses, such, as, the, anattalakkhana, sutta, emptiness, or, voidness, skt, nyat, pali, su, at, is, a, related, concept, with, many, different, interpretations, throughout, the, various, buddhisms, in, early, buddhism, it, was, commonly, stated, that, all, five, aggregates, are, void, rittaka, hollow, tucchaka, coreless, as, raka, for, example, as, in, the, phe, api, pama, sutta, sn, 22, 95, similarly, in, theravada, buddhism, it, often, means, that, the, five, aggregates, are, empty, of, a, self, emptiness, is, a, central, concept, in, mah, y, na, buddhism, especially, in, nagarjuna, s, madhyamaka, school, and, in, the, praj, p, ramit, sutras, in, madhyamaka, philosophy, emptiness, is, the, view, which, holds, that, all, phenomena, are, without, any, svabhava, literally, own, nature, or, self, nature, and, are, thus, without, any, underlying, essence, and, so, are, empty, of, being, independent, this, doctrine, sought, to, refute, the, heterodox, theories, of, svabhava, circulating, at, the, time, all, forms, of, buddhism, revere, and, take, spiritual, refuge, in, the, three, jewels, triratna, buddha, dharma, and, sangha, while, all, varieties, of, buddhism, revere, buddha, and, buddhahood, they, have, different, views, on, what, these, are, regardless, of, their, interpretation, the, concept, of, buddha, is, central, to, all, forms, of, buddhism, in, theravada, buddhism, a, buddha, is, someone, who, has, become, awake, through, their, own, efforts, and, insight, they, have, put, an, end, to, their, cycle, of, rebirths, and, have, ended, all, unwholesome, mental, states, which, lead, to, bad, action, and, thus, are, morally, perfected, while, subject, to, the, limitations, of, the, human, body, in, certain, ways, for, example, in, the, early, texts, the, buddha, suffers, from, backaches, a, buddha, is, said, to, be, deep, immeasurable, hard, to, fathom, as, is, the, great, ocean, and, also, has, immense, psychic, powers, abhij, theravada, generally, sees, gautama, buddha, the, historical, buddha, sakyamuni, as, the, only, buddha, of, the, current, era, mah, y, na, buddhism, meanwhile, has, a, vastly, expanded, cosmology, with, various, buddhas, and, other, holy, beings, aryas, residing, in, different, realms, mah, y, na, texts, not, only, revere, numerous, buddhas, besides, shakyamuni, such, as, amitabha, and, vairocana, but, also, see, them, as, transcendental, or, supramundane, lokuttara, beings, mah, y, na, buddhism, holds, that, these, other, buddhas, in, other, realms, can, be, contacted, and, are, able, to, benefit, beings, in, this, world, in, mah, y, na, a, buddha, is, a, kind, of, spiritual, king, a, protector, of, all, creatures, with, a, lifetime, that, is, countless, of, eons, long, rather, than, just, a, human, teacher, who, has, transcended, the, world, after, death, shakyamuni, s, life, and, death, on, earth, is, then, usually, understood, as, a, mere, appearance, or, a, manifestation, skilfully, projected, into, earthly, life, by, a, long, enlightened, transcendent, being, who, is, still, available, to, teach, the, faithful, through, visionary, experiences, the, second, of, the, three, jewels, is, dharma, pali, dhamma, which, in, buddhism, refers, to, the, buddha, s, teaching, which, includes, all, of, the, main, ideas, outlined, above, while, this, teaching, reflects, the, true, nature, of, reality, it, is, not, a, belief, to, be, clung, to, but, a, pragmatic, teaching, to, be, put, into, practice, it, is, likened, to, a, raft, which, is, for, crossing, over, to, nirvana, not, for, holding, on, to, it, also, refers, to, the, universal, law, and, cosmic, order, which, that, teaching, both, reveals, and, relies, upon, it, is, an, everlasting, principle, which, applies, to, all, beings, and, worlds, in, that, sense, it, is, also, the, ultimate, truth, and, reality, about, the, universe, it, is, thus, the, way, that, things, really, are, the, third, jewel, which, buddhists, take, refuge, in, is, the, sangha, which, refers, to, the, monastic, community, of, monks, and, nuns, who, follow, gautama, buddha, s, monastic, discipline, which, was, designed, to, shape, the, sangha, as, an, ideal, community, with, the, optimum, conditions, for, spiritual, growth, the, sangha, consists, of, those, who, have, chosen, to, follow, the, buddha, s, ideal, way, of, life, which, is, one, of, celibate, monastic, renunciation, with, minimal, material, possessions, such, as, an, alms, bowl, and, robes, the, sangha, is, seen, as, important, because, they, preserve, and, pass, down, buddha, dharma, as, gethin, states, the, sangha, lives, the, teaching, preserves, the, teaching, as, scriptures, and, teaches, the, wider, community, without, the, sangha, there, is, no, buddhism, the, sangha, also, acts, as, a, field, of, merit, for, laypersons, allowing, them, to, make, spiritual, merit, or, goodness, by, donating, to, the, sangha, and, supporting, them, in, return, they, keep, their, duty, to, preserve, and, spread, the, dharma, everywhere, for, the, good, of, the, world, there, is, also, a, separate, definition, of, sangha, referring, to, those, who, have, attained, any, stage, of, awakening, whether, or, not, they, are, monastics, this, sangha, is, called, the, ryasa, gha, noble, sangha, all, forms, of, buddhism, generally, reveres, these, ryas, pali, ariya, noble, ones, or, holy, ones, who, are, spiritually, attained, beings, aryas, have, attained, the, fruits, of, the, buddhist, path, becoming, an, arya, is, a, goal, in, most, forms, of, buddhism, the, ryasa, gha, includes, holy, beings, such, as, bodhisattvas, arhats, and, stream, enterers, mah, y, na, buddhism, also, differs, from, theravada, and, the, other, schools, of, early, buddhism, in, promoting, several, unique, doctrines, which, are, contained, in, mah, y, na, sutras, and, philosophical, treatises, one, of, these, is, the, unique, interpretation, of, emptiness, and, dependent, origination, found, in, the, madhyamaka, school, another, very, influential, doctrine, for, mah, y, na, is, the, main, philosophical, view, of, the, yog, c, ra, school, variously, termed, vij, aptim, trat, v, da, the, doctrine, that, there, are, only, ideas, or, mental, impressions, or, vij, nav, da, the, doctrine, of, consciousness, according, to, mark, siderits, what, classical, yog, c, ra, thinkers, like, vasubandhu, had, in, mind, is, that, we, are, only, ever, aware, of, mental, images, or, impressions, which, may, appear, as, external, objects, but, there, is, actually, no, such, thing, outside, the, mind, there, are, several, interpretations, of, this, main, theory, many, scholars, see, it, as, a, type, of, idealism, others, as, a, kind, of, phenomenology, another, very, influential, concept, unique, to, mah, y, na, is, that, of, buddha, nature, buddhadh, tu, or, tathagata, womb, tath, gatagarbha, buddha, nature, is, a, concept, found, in, some, 1st, millennium, ce, buddhist, texts, such, as, the, tath, gatagarbha, s, tras, according, to, paul, williams, these, sutras, suggest, that, all, sentient, beings, contain, a, tathagata, as, their, essence, core, inner, nature, self, according, to, karl, brunnholzl, the, earliest, mahayana, sutras, that, are, based, on, and, discuss, the, notion, of, tath, gatagarbha, as, the, buddha, potential, that, is, innate, in, all, sentient, beings, began, to, appear, in, written, form, in, the, late, second, and, early, third, century, for, some, the, doctrine, seems, to, conflict, with, the, buddhist, anatta, doctrine, non, self, leading, scholars, to, posit, that, the, tath, gatagarbha, sutras, were, written, to, promote, buddhism, to, non, buddhists, this, can, be, seen, in, texts, like, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, which, state, that, buddha, nature, is, taught, to, help, those, who, have, fear, when, they, listen, to, the, teaching, of, anatta, buddhist, texts, like, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, clarify, that, the, self, implied, in, tathagatagarbha, doctrine, is, actually, not, self, various, interpretations, of, the, concept, have, been, advanced, by, buddhist, thinkers, throughout, the, history, of, buddhist, thought, and, most, attempt, to, avoid, anything, like, the, hindu, atman, doctrine, these, indian, buddhist, ideas, in, various, synthetic, ways, form, the, basis, of, subsequent, mah, y, na, philosophy, in, tibetan, buddhism, and, east, asian, buddhism, the, bodhipakkhiy, dhamm, are, seven, lists, of, qualities, or, factors, that, promote, spiritual, awakening, bodhi, each, list, is, a, short, summary, of, the, buddhist, path, and, the, seven, lists, substantially, overlap, the, best, known, list, in, the, west, is, the, noble, eightfold, path, but, a, wide, variety, of, paths, and, models, of, progress, have, been, used, and, described, in, the, different, buddhist, traditions, however, they, generally, share, basic, practices, such, as, sila, ethics, samadhi, meditation, dhyana, and, praj, a, wisdom, which, are, known, as, the, three, trainings, an, important, additional, practice, is, a, kind, and, compassionate, attitude, toward, every, living, being, and, the, world, devotion, is, also, important, in, some, buddhist, traditions, and, in, the, tibetan, traditions, visualisations, of, deities, and, mandalas, are, important, the, value, of, textual, study, is, regarded, differently, in, the, various, buddhist, traditions, it, is, central, to, theravada, and, highly, important, to, tibetan, buddhism, while, the, zen, tradition, takes, an, ambiguous, stance, an, important, guiding, principle, of, buddhist, practice, is, the, middle, way, madhyamapratipad, it, was, a, part, of, buddha, s, first, sermon, where, he, presented, the, noble, eightfold, path, that, was, a, middle, way, between, the, extremes, of, asceticism, and, hedonistic, sense, pleasures, in, buddhism, states, harvey, the, doctrine, of, dependent, arising, conditioned, arising, prat, tyasamutp, da, to, explain, rebirth, is, viewed, as, the, middle, way, between, the, doctrines, that, a, being, has, a, permanent, soul, involved, in, rebirth, eternalism, and, death, is, final, and, there, is, no, rebirth, annihilationism, a, common, presentation, style, of, the, path, m, rga, to, liberation, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, is, the, graduated, talk, in, which, the, buddha, lays, out, a, step, by, step, training, in, the, early, texts, numerous, different, sequences, of, the, gradual, path, can, be, found, one, of, the, most, important, and, widely, used, presentations, among, the, various, buddhist, schools, is, the, noble, eightfold, path, or, eightfold, path, of, the, noble, ones, skt, ry, gam, rga, this, can, be, found, in, various, discourses, most, famously, in, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, the, discourse, on, the, turning, of, the, dharma, wheel, other, suttas, such, as, the, tevijja, sutta, and, the, cula, hatthipadopama, sutta, give, a, different, outline, of, the, path, though, with, many, similar, elements, such, as, ethics, and, meditation, according, to, rupert, gethin, the, path, to, awakening, is, also, frequently, summarized, by, another, a, short, formula, abandoning, the, hindrances, practice, of, the, four, establishings, of, mindfulness, and, development, of, the, awakening, factors, the, eightfold, path, consists, of, a, set, of, eight, interconnected, factors, or, conditions, that, when, developed, together, lead, to, the, cessation, of, dukkha, these, eight, factors, are, right, view, or, right, understanding, right, intention, or, right, thought, right, speech, right, action, right, livelihood, right, effort, right, mindfulness, and, right, concentration, this, eightfold, path, is, the, fourth, of, the, four, noble, truths, and, asserts, the, path, to, the, cessation, of, dukkha, suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness, the, path, teaches, that, the, way, of, the, enlightened, ones, stopped, their, craving, clinging, and, karmic, accumulations, and, thus, ended, their, endless, cycles, of, rebirth, and, suffering, the, noble, eightfold, path, is, grouped, into, three, basic, divisions, as, follows, in, various, suttas, which, present, the, graduated, path, taught, by, the, buddha, such, as, the, sama, aphala, sutta, and, the, cula, hatthipadopama, sutta, the, first, step, on, the, path, is, hearing, the, buddha, teach, the, dharma, this, then, said, to, lead, to, the, acquiring, of, confidence, or, faith, in, the, buddha, s, teachings, mahayana, buddhist, teachers, such, as, yin, shun, also, state, that, hearing, the, dharma, and, study, of, the, buddhist, discourses, is, necessary, if, one, wants, to, learn, and, practice, the, buddha, dharma, likewise, in, indo, tibetan, buddhism, the, stages, of, the, path, lamrim, texts, generally, place, the, activity, of, listening, to, the, buddhist, teachings, as, an, important, early, practice, traditionally, the, first, step, in, most, buddhist, schools, requires, taking, of, the, three, refuges, also, called, the, three, jewels, sanskrit, triratna, pali, tiratana, as, the, foundation, of, one, s, religious, practice, this, practice, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, brahmanical, motif, of, the, triple, refuge, found, in, the, rigveda, 9, 97, 47, rigveda, 6, 46, 9, and, chandogya, upanishad, 2, 22, 3, 4, tibetan, buddhism, sometimes, adds, a, fourth, refuge, in, the, lama, the, three, refuges, are, believed, by, buddhists, to, be, protective, and, a, form, of, reverence, the, ancient, formula, which, is, repeated, for, taking, refuge, affirms, that, i, go, to, the, buddha, as, refuge, i, go, to, the, dhamma, as, refuge, i, go, to, the, sangha, as, refuge, reciting, the, three, refuges, according, to, harvey, is, considered, not, as, a, place, to, hide, rather, a, thought, that, purifies, uplifts, and, strengthens, the, heart, la, sanskrit, or, s, la, p, li, is, the, concept, of, moral, virtues, that, is, the, second, group, and, an, integral, part, of, the, noble, eightfold, path, it, generally, consists, of, right, speech, right, action, and, right, livelihood, one, of, the, most, basic, forms, of, ethics, in, buddhism, is, the, taking, of, precepts, this, includes, the, five, precepts, for, laypeople, eight, or, ten, precepts, for, monastic, life, as, well, as, rules, of, dhamma, vinaya, or, patimokkha, adopted, by, a, monastery, other, important, elements, of, buddhist, ethics, include, giving, or, charity, d, na, mett, good, will, heedfulness, appamada, self, respect, hri, and, regard, for, consequences, apatrapya, buddhist, scriptures, explain, the, five, precepts, pali, pa, cas, la, sanskrit, pa, ca, la, as, the, minimal, standard, of, buddhist, morality, it, is, the, most, important, system, of, morality, in, buddhism, together, with, the, monastic, rules, the, five, precepts, are, seen, as, a, basic, training, applicable, to, all, buddhists, they, are, undertaking, and, upholding, the, five, precepts, is, based, on, the, principle, of, non, harming, p, li, and, sanskrit, ahi, sa, the, pali, canon, recommends, one, to, compare, oneself, with, others, and, on, the, basis, of, that, not, to, hurt, others, compassion, and, a, belief, in, karmic, retribution, form, the, foundation, of, the, precepts, undertaking, the, five, precepts, is, part, of, regular, lay, devotional, practice, both, at, home, and, at, the, local, temple, however, the, extent, to, which, people, keep, them, differs, per, region, and, time, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, r, vakay, na, precepts, in, the, mah, y, na, tradition, contrasting, them, with, the, bodhisattva, precepts, vinaya, is, the, specific, code, of, conduct, for, a, sangha, of, monks, or, nuns, it, includes, the, patimokkha, a, set, of, 227, offences, including, 75, rules, of, decorum, for, monks, along, with, penalties, for, transgression, in, the, theravadin, tradition, the, precise, content, of, the, vinaya, pitaka, scriptures, on, the, vinaya, differs, in, different, schools, and, tradition, and, different, monasteries, set, their, own, standards, on, its, implementation, the, list, of, pattimokkha, is, recited, every, fortnight, in, a, ritual, gathering, of, all, monks, buddhist, text, with, vinaya, rules, for, monasteries, have, been, traced, in, all, buddhist, traditions, with, the, oldest, surviving, being, the, ancient, chinese, translations, monastic, communities, in, the, buddhist, tradition, cut, normal, social, ties, to, family, and, community, and, live, as, islands, unto, themselves, within, a, monastic, fraternity, a, sangha, has, its, own, rules, a, monk, abides, by, these, institutionalised, rules, and, living, life, as, the, vinaya, prescribes, it, is, not, merely, a, means, but, very, nearly, the, end, in, itself, transgressions, by, a, monk, on, sangha, vinaya, rules, invites, enforcement, which, can, include, temporary, or, permanent, expulsion, another, important, practice, taught, by, the, buddha, is, the, restraint, of, the, senses, indriyasamvara, in, the, various, graduated, paths, this, is, usually, presented, as, a, practice, which, is, taught, prior, to, formal, sitting, meditation, and, which, supports, meditation, by, weakening, sense, desires, that, are, a, hindrance, to, meditation, according, to, an, layo, sense, restraint, is, when, one, guards, the, sense, doors, in, order, to, prevent, sense, impressions, from, leading, to, desires, and, discontent, this, is, not, an, avoidance, of, sense, impression, but, a, kind, of, mindful, attention, towards, the, sense, impressions, which, does, not, dwell, on, their, main, features, or, signs, nimitta, this, is, said, to, prevent, harmful, influences, from, entering, the, mind, this, practice, is, said, to, give, rise, to, an, inner, peace, and, happiness, which, forms, a, basis, for, concentration, and, insight, a, related, buddhist, virtue, and, practice, is, renunciation, or, the, intent, for, desirelessness, nekkhamma, generally, renunciation, is, the, giving, up, of, actions, and, desires, that, are, seen, as, unwholesome, on, the, path, such, as, lust, for, sensuality, and, worldly, things, renunciation, can, be, cultivated, in, different, ways, the, practice, of, giving, for, example, is, one, form, of, cultivating, renunciation, another, one, is, the, giving, up, of, lay, life, and, becoming, a, monastic, bhiksu, or, bhiksuni, practicing, celibacy, whether, for, life, as, a, monk, or, temporarily, is, also, a, form, of, renunciation, many, jataka, stories, focus, on, how, the, buddha, practiced, renunciation, in, past, lives, one, way, of, cultivating, renunciation, taught, by, the, buddha, is, the, contemplation, anupassana, of, the, dangers, or, negative, consequences, of, sensual, pleasure, k, m, na, d, nava, as, part, of, the, graduated, discourse, this, contemplation, is, taught, after, the, practice, of, giving, and, morality, another, related, practice, to, renunciation, and, sense, restraint, taught, by, the, buddha, is, restraint, in, eating, or, moderation, with, food, which, for, monks, generally, means, not, eating, after, noon, devout, laypersons, also, follow, this, rule, during, special, days, of, religious, observance, uposatha, observing, the, uposatha, also, includes, other, practices, dealing, with, renunciation, mainly, the, eight, precepts, for, buddhist, monastics, renunciation, can, also, be, trained, through, several, optional, ascetic, practices, called, dhuta, ga, in, different, buddhist, traditions, other, related, practices, which, focus, on, fasting, are, followed, the, training, of, the, faculty, called, mindfulness, pali, sati, sanskrit, sm, ti, literally, meaning, recollection, remembering, is, central, in, buddhism, according, to, analayo, mindfulness, is, a, full, awareness, of, the, present, moment, which, enhances, and, strengthens, memory, the, indian, buddhist, philosopher, asanga, defined, mindfulness, thus, it, is, non, forgetting, by, the, mind, with, regard, to, the, object, experienced, its, function, is, non, distraction, according, to, rupert, gethin, sati, is, also, an, awareness, of, things, in, relation, to, things, and, hence, an, awareness, of, their, relative, value, there, are, different, practices, and, exercises, for, training, mindfulness, in, the, early, discourses, such, as, the, four, satipa, h, nas, sanskrit, sm, tyupasth, na, establishments, of, mindfulness, and, n, p, nasati, sanskrit, n, p, nasm, ti, mindfulness, of, breathing, a, closely, related, mental, faculty, which, is, often, mentioned, side, by, side, with, mindfulness, is, sampaja, a, clear, comprehension, this, faculty, is, the, ability, to, comprehend, what, one, is, doing, and, is, happening, in, the, mind, and, whether, it, is, being, influenced, by, unwholesome, states, or, wholesome, ones, a, wide, range, of, meditation, practices, has, developed, in, the, buddhist, traditions, but, meditation, primarily, refers, to, the, attainment, of, sam, dhi, and, the, practice, of, dhy, na, pali, jh, na, sam, dhi, is, a, calm, undistracted, unified, and, concentrated, state, of, awareness, it, is, defined, by, asanga, as, one, pointedness, of, mind, on, the, object, to, be, investigated, its, function, consists, of, giving, a, basis, to, knowledge, j, na, dhy, na, is, state, of, perfect, equanimity, and, awareness, upekkh, sati, parisuddhi, reached, through, focused, mental, training, the, practice, of, dhy, na, aids, in, maintaining, a, calm, mind, and, avoiding, disturbance, of, this, calm, mind, by, mindfulness, of, disturbing, thoughts, and, feelings, the, earliest, evidence, of, yogis, and, their, meditative, tradition, states, karel, werner, is, found, in, the, ke, in, hymn, 10, 136, of, the, rigveda, while, evidence, suggests, meditation, was, practised, in, the, centuries, preceding, the, buddha, the, meditative, methodologies, described, in, the, buddhist, texts, are, some, of, the, earliest, among, texts, that, have, survived, into, the, modern, era, these, methodologies, likely, incorporate, what, existed, before, the, buddha, as, well, as, those, first, developed, within, buddhism, there, is, no, scholarly, agreement, on, the, origin, and, source, of, the, practice, of, dhy, na, some, scholars, like, bronkhorst, see, the, four, dhy, nas, as, a, buddhist, invention, alexander, wynne, argues, that, the, buddha, learned, dhy, na, from, brahmanical, teachers, whatever, the, case, the, buddha, taught, meditation, with, a, new, focus, and, interpretation, particularly, through, the, four, dhy, nas, methodology, in, which, mindfulness, is, maintained, further, the, focus, of, meditation, and, the, underlying, theory, of, liberation, guiding, the, meditation, has, been, different, in, buddhism, for, example, states, bronkhorst, the, verse, 4, 4, 23, of, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, with, its, become, calm, subdued, quiet, patiently, enduring, concentrated, one, sees, soul, in, oneself, is, most, probably, a, meditative, state, the, buddhist, discussion, of, meditation, is, without, the, concept, of, soul, and, the, discussion, criticises, both, the, ascetic, meditation, of, jainism, and, the, real, self, soul, meditation, of, hinduism, often, grouped, into, the, jh, na, scheme, are, four, other, meditative, states, referred, to, in, the, early, texts, as, arupa, sam, pattis, formless, attainments, these, are, also, referred, to, in, commentarial, literature, as, immaterial, formless, jh, nas, ar, pajh, nas, the, first, formless, attainment, is, a, place, or, realm, of, infinite, space, k, s, na, c, yatana, without, form, or, colour, or, shape, the, second, is, termed, the, realm, of, infinite, consciousness, vi, a, c, yatana, the, third, is, the, realm, of, nothingness, ki, ca, yatana, while, the, fourth, is, the, realm, of, neither, perception, nor, non, perception, the, four, rupa, jh, nas, in, buddhist, practice, leads, to, rebirth, in, successfully, better, rupa, brahma, heavenly, realms, while, arupa, jh, nas, leads, into, arupa, heavens, in, the, pali, canon, the, buddha, outlines, two, meditative, qualities, which, are, mutually, supportive, samatha, p, li, sanskrit, amatha, calm, and, vipassan, sanskrit, vipa, yan, insight, the, buddha, compares, these, mental, qualities, to, a, swift, pair, of, messengers, who, together, help, deliver, the, message, of, nibbana, sn, 35, 245, the, various, buddhist, traditions, generally, see, buddhist, meditation, as, being, divided, into, those, two, main, types, samatha, is, also, called, calming, meditation, and, focuses, on, stilling, and, concentrating, the, mind, i, e, developing, samadhi, and, the, four, dhy, nas, according, to, damien, keown, vipassan, meanwhile, focuses, on, the, generation, of, penetrating, and, critical, insight, pa, there, are, numerous, doctrinal, positions, and, disagreements, within, the, different, buddhist, traditions, regarding, these, qualities, or, forms, of, meditation, for, example, in, the, pali, four, ways, to, arahantship, sutta, an, 4, 170, it, is, said, that, one, can, develop, calm, and, then, insight, or, insight, and, then, calm, or, both, at, the, same, time, meanwhile, in, vasubandhu, s, abhidharmako, ak, rik, vipa, yan, is, said, to, be, practiced, once, one, has, reached, samadhi, by, cultivating, the, four, foundations, of, mindfulness, sm, tyupasth, na, s, beginning, with, comments, by, la, vallee, poussin, a, series, of, scholars, have, argued, that, these, two, meditation, types, reflect, a, tension, between, two, different, ancient, buddhist, traditions, regarding, the, use, of, dhy, na, one, which, focused, on, insight, based, practice, and, the, other, which, focused, purely, on, dhy, na, however, other, scholars, such, as, analayo, and, rupert, gethin, have, disagreed, with, this, two, paths, thesis, instead, seeing, both, of, these, practices, as, complementary, the, four, immeasurables, or, four, abodes, also, called, brahma, viharas, are, virtues, or, directions, for, meditation, in, buddhist, traditions, which, helps, a, person, be, reborn, in, the, heavenly, brahma, realm, these, are, traditionally, believed, to, be, a, characteristic, of, the, deity, brahma, and, the, heavenly, abode, he, resides, in, the, four, brahma, vihara, are, some, buddhist, traditions, especially, those, associated, with, tantric, buddhism, also, known, as, vajrayana, and, secret, mantra, use, images, and, symbols, of, deities, and, buddhas, in, meditation, this, is, generally, done, by, mentally, visualizing, a, buddha, image, or, some, other, mental, image, like, a, symbol, a, mandala, a, syllable, etc, and, using, that, image, to, cultivate, calm, and, insight, one, may, also, visualize, and, identify, oneself, with, the, imagined, deity, while, visualization, practices, have, been, particularly, popular, in, vajrayana, they, may, also, found, in, mahayana, and, theravada, traditions, in, tibetan, buddhism, unique, tantric, techniques, which, include, visualization, but, also, mantra, recitation, mandalas, and, other, elements, are, considered, to, be, much, more, effective, than, non, tantric, meditations, and, they, are, one, of, the, most, popular, meditation, methods, the, methods, of, unsurpassable, yoga, tantra, anuttarayogatantra, are, in, turn, seen, as, the, highest, and, most, advanced, anuttarayoga, practice, is, divided, into, two, stages, the, generation, stage, and, the, completion, stage, in, the, generation, stage, one, meditates, on, emptiness, and, visualizes, oneself, as, a, deity, as, well, as, visualizing, its, mandala, the, focus, is, on, developing, clear, appearance, and, divine, pride, the, understanding, that, oneself, and, the, deity, are, one, this, method, is, also, known, as, deity, yoga, devata, yoga, there, are, numerous, meditation, deities, yidam, used, each, with, a, mandala, a, circular, symbolic, map, used, in, meditation, praj, sanskrit, or, pa, p, li, is, wisdom, or, knowledge, of, the, true, nature, of, existence, another, term, which, is, associated, with, praj, and, sometimes, is, equivalent, to, it, is, vipassan, p, li, or, vipa, yan, sanskrit, which, is, often, translated, as, insight, in, buddhist, texts, the, faculty, of, insight, is, often, said, to, be, cultivated, through, the, four, establishments, of, mindfulness, in, the, early, texts, pa, is, included, as, one, of, the, five, faculties, indriya, which, are, commonly, listed, as, important, spiritual, elements, to, be, cultivated, see, for, example, an, i, 16, pa, along, with, samadhi, is, also, listed, as, one, of, the, trainings, in, the, higher, states, of, mind, adhicittasikkha, the, buddhist, tradition, regards, ignorance, avidy, a, fundamental, ignorance, misunderstanding, or, mis, perception, of, the, nature, of, reality, as, one, of, the, basic, causes, of, dukkha, and, samsara, overcoming, this, ignorance, is, part, of, the, path, to, awakening, this, overcoming, includes, the, contemplation, of, impermanence, and, the, non, self, nature, of, reality, and, this, develops, dispassion, for, the, objects, of, clinging, and, liberates, a, being, from, dukkha, and, sa, s, ra, praj, is, important, in, all, buddhist, traditions, it, is, variously, described, as, wisdom, regarding, the, impermanent, and, not, self, nature, of, dharmas, phenomena, the, functioning, of, karma, and, rebirth, and, knowledge, of, dependent, origination, likewise, vipa, yan, is, described, in, a, similar, way, such, as, in, the, pa, isambhid, magga, where, it, is, said, to, be, the, contemplation, of, things, as, impermanent, unsatisfactory, and, not, self, most, forms, of, buddhism, consider, saddh, sanskrit, raddh, trustful, confidence, or, faith, as, a, quality, which, must, be, balanced, by, wisdom, and, as, a, preparation, for, or, accompaniment, of, meditation, because, of, this, devotion, sanskrit, bhakti, pali, bhatti, is, an, important, part, of, the, practice, of, most, buddhists, devotional, practices, include, ritual, prayer, prostration, offerings, pilgrimage, and, chanting, buddhist, devotion, is, usually, focused, on, some, object, image, or, location, that, is, seen, as, holy, or, spiritually, influential, examples, of, objects, of, devotion, include, paintings, or, statues, of, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, stupas, and, bodhi, trees, public, group, chanting, for, devotional, and, ceremonial, is, common, to, all, buddhist, traditions, and, goes, back, to, ancient, india, where, chanting, aided, in, the, memorization, of, the, orally, transmitted, teachings, rosaries, called, malas, are, used, in, all, buddhist, traditions, to, count, repeated, chanting, of, common, formulas, or, mantras, chanting, is, thus, a, type, of, devotional, group, meditation, which, leads, to, tranquility, and, communicates, the, buddhist, teachings, based, on, the, indian, principle, of, ahimsa, non, harming, the, buddha, s, ethics, strongly, condemn, the, harming, of, all, sentient, beings, including, all, animals, he, thus, condemned, the, animal, sacrifice, of, the, brahmins, as, well, hunting, and, killing, animals, for, food, however, early, buddhist, texts, depict, the, buddha, as, allowing, monastics, to, eat, meat, this, seems, to, be, because, monastics, begged, for, their, food, and, thus, were, supposed, to, accept, whatever, food, was, offered, to, them, this, was, tempered, by, the, rule, that, meat, had, to, be, three, times, clean, they, had, not, seen, had, not, heard, and, had, no, reason, to, suspect, that, the, animal, had, been, killed, so, that, the, meat, could, be, given, to, them, also, while, the, buddha, did, not, explicitly, promote, vegetarianism, in, his, discourses, he, did, state, that, gaining, one, s, livelihood, from, the, meat, trade, was, unethical, in, contrast, to, this, various, mahayana, sutras, and, texts, like, the, mahaparinirvana, sutra, surangama, sutra, and, the, lankavatara, sutra, state, that, the, buddha, promoted, vegetarianism, out, of, compassion, indian, mahayana, thinkers, like, shantideva, promoted, the, avoidance, of, meat, throughout, history, the, issue, of, whether, buddhists, should, be, vegetarian, has, remained, a, much, debated, topic, and, there, is, a, variety, of, opinions, on, this, issue, among, modern, buddhists, buddhism, like, all, indian, religions, was, initially, an, oral, tradition, in, ancient, times, the, buddha, s, words, the, early, doctrines, concepts, and, their, traditional, interpretations, were, orally, transmitted, from, one, generation, to, the, next, the, earliest, oral, texts, were, transmitted, in, middle, indo, aryan, languages, called, prakrits, such, as, pali, through, the, use, of, communal, recitation, and, other, mnemonic, techniques, the, first, buddhist, canonical, texts, were, likely, written, down, in, sri, lanka, about, 400, years, after, the, buddha, died, the, texts, were, part, of, the, tripitakas, and, many, versions, appeared, thereafter, claiming, to, be, the, words, of, the, buddha, scholarly, buddhist, commentary, texts, with, named, authors, appeared, in, india, around, the, 2nd, century, ce, these, texts, were, written, in, pali, or, sanskrit, sometimes, regional, languages, as, palm, leaf, manuscripts, birch, bark, painted, scrolls, carved, into, temple, walls, and, later, on, paper, unlike, what, the, bible, is, to, christianity, and, the, quran, is, to, islam, but, like, all, major, ancient, indian, religions, there, is, no, consensus, among, the, different, buddhist, traditions, as, to, what, constitutes, the, scriptures, or, a, common, canon, in, buddhism, the, general, belief, among, buddhists, is, that, the, canonical, corpus, is, vast, this, corpus, includes, the, ancient, sutras, organised, into, nikayas, or, agamas, itself, the, part, of, three, basket, of, texts, called, the, tripitakas, each, buddhist, tradition, has, its, own, collection, of, texts, much, of, which, is, translation, of, ancient, pali, and, sanskrit, buddhist, texts, of, india, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, for, example, includes, 2184, texts, in, 55, volumes, while, the, tibetan, canon, comprises, 1108, texts, all, claimed, to, have, been, spoken, by, the, buddha, and, another, 3461, texts, composed, by, indian, scholars, revered, in, the, tibetan, tradition, the, buddhist, textual, history, is, vast, over, 40, 000, manuscripts, mostly, buddhist, some, non, buddhist, were, discovered, in, 1900, in, the, dunhuang, chinese, cave, alone, the, early, buddhist, texts, refers, to, the, literature, which, is, considered, by, modern, scholars, to, be, the, earliest, buddhist, material, the, first, four, pali, nikayas, and, the, corresponding, chinese, gamas, are, generally, considered, to, be, among, the, earliest, material, apart, from, these, there, are, also, fragmentary, collections, of, ebt, materials, in, other, languages, such, as, sanskrit, khotanese, tibetan, and, g, ndh, r, the, modern, study, of, early, buddhism, often, relies, on, comparative, scholarship, using, these, various, early, buddhist, sources, to, identify, parallel, texts, and, common, doctrinal, content, one, feature, of, these, early, texts, are, literary, structures, which, reflect, oral, transmission, such, as, widespread, repetition, after, the, development, of, the, different, early, buddhist, schools, these, schools, began, to, develop, their, own, textual, collections, which, were, termed, tripi, akas, triple, baskets, many, early, tripi, akas, like, the, p, li, tipitaka, were, divided, into, three, sections, vinaya, pitaka, focuses, on, monastic, rule, sutta, pitaka, buddhist, discourses, and, abhidhamma, pitaka, which, contain, expositions, and, commentaries, on, the, doctrine, the, p, li, tipitaka, also, known, as, the, pali, canon, of, the, theravada, school, constitutes, the, only, complete, collection, of, buddhist, texts, in, an, indic, language, which, has, survived, until, today, however, many, sutras, vinayas, and, abhidharma,

philosophical, schools, and, traditions, from, which, contemporary, therav, da, emerged, but, as, the, hinayana, term, is, considered, derogatory, a, variety, of, other, terms, are, used, instead, including, r, vakay, na, nikaya, buddhism, early, buddhist, schools, sectarian, buddhism, and, conservative, buddhism, not, all, traditions, of, buddhism, share, the, same, philosophical, outlook, or,

states, like, other, religions, the, findings, of, modern, science, have, challenged, its, basic, premises, one, response, to, some, of, these, challenges, has, come, to, be, called, buddhist, modernism, early, buddhist, modernist, figures, such, as, the, american, convert, henry, olcott, 1832, 1907, and, anagarika, dharmapala, 1864, 1933, reinterpreted, and, promoted, buddhism, as, a, scientific, and, rational, religion, which, they, saw, as, compatible, with, modern, science, east, asian, buddhism, meanwhile, suffered, under, various, wars, which, ravaged, china, during, the, modern, era, such, as, the, taiping, rebellion, and, world, war, ii, which, also, affected, korean, buddhism, during, the, republican, period, 1912, 49, a, new, movement, called, humanistic, buddhism, was, developed, by, figures, such, as, taixu, 1899, 1947, and, though, buddhist, institutions, were, destroyed, during, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 76, there, has, been, a, revival, of, the, religion, in, china, after, 1977, japanese, buddhism, also, went, through, a, period, of, modernisation, during, the, meiji, period, in, central, asia, meanwhile, the, arrival, of, communist, repression, to, tibet, 1966, 1980, and, mongolia, between, 1924, and, 1990, had, a, strong, negative, impact, on, buddhist, institutions, though, the, situation, has, improved, somewhat, since, the, 80s, and, 90s, in, afghanistan, and, pakistan, militants, have, destroyed, some, historic, buddhist, monuments, while, there, were, some, encounters, of, western, travellers, or, missionaries, such, as, st, francis, xavier, and, ippolito, desideri, with, buddhist, cultures, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, century, that, buddhism, began, to, be, studied, by, western, scholars, it, was, the, work, of, pioneering, scholars, such, as, eug, ne, burnouf, max, m, ller, hermann, oldenberg, and, thomas, william, rhys, davids, that, paved, the, way, for, modern, buddhist, studies, in, the, west, the, english, words, such, as, buddhism, boudhist, bauddhist, and, buddhist, were, coined, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, west, while, in, 1881, rhys, davids, founded, the, pali, text, society, an, influential, western, resource, of, buddhist, literature, in, the, pali, language, and, one, of, the, earliest, publisher, of, a, journal, on, buddhist, studies, it, was, also, during, the, 19th, century, that, asian, buddhist, immigrants, mainly, from, china, and, japan, began, to, arrive, in, western, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, canada, bringing, with, them, their, buddhist, religion, this, period, also, saw, the, first, westerners, to, formally, convert, to, buddhism, such, as, helena, blavatsky, and, henry, steel, olcott, an, important, event, in, the, introduction, of, buddhism, to, the, west, was, the, 1893, world, parliament, of, religions, which, for, the, first, time, saw, well, publicized, speeches, by, major, buddhist, leaders, alongside, other, religious, leaders, the, 20th, century, saw, a, prolific, growth, of, new, buddhist, institutions, in, western, countries, including, the, buddhist, society, london, 1924, das, buddhistische, haus, 1924, and, datsan, gunzechoinei, in, st, petersburg, the, publication, and, translations, of, buddhist, literature, in, western, languages, thereafter, accelerated, after, the, second, world, war, further, immigration, from, asia, globalisation, the, secularisation, on, western, culture, as, well, a, renewed, interest, in, buddhism, among, the, 60s, counterculture, led, to, further, growth, in, buddhist, institutions, influential, figures, on, post, war, western, buddhism, include, shunryu, suzuki, jack, kerouac, alan, watts, th, ch, nh, t, h, nh, and, the, 14th, dalai, lama, while, buddhist, institutions, have, grown, some, of, the, central, premises, of, buddhism, such, as, the, cycles, of, rebirth, and, four, noble, truths, have, been, problematic, in, the, west, in, contrast, states, christopher, gowans, for, most, ordinary, buddhists, today, as, well, as, in, the, past, their, basic, moral, orientation, is, governed, by, belief, in, karma, and, rebirth, most, asian, buddhist, laypersons, states, kevin, trainor, have, historically, pursued, buddhist, rituals, and, practices, seeking, better, rebirth, not, nirvana, or, freedom, from, rebirth, buddhism, has, spread, across, the, world, and, buddhist, texts, are, increasingly, translated, into, local, languages, while, buddhism, in, the, west, is, often, seen, as, exotic, and, progressive, in, the, east, it, is, regarded, as, familiar, and, traditional, in, countries, such, as, cambodia, and, bhutan, it, is, recognised, as, the, state, religion, and, receives, government, support, a, number, of, modern, movements, in, buddhism, emerged, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, these, new, forms, of, buddhism, are, diverse, and, significantly, depart, from, traditional, beliefs, and, practices, in, india, b, r, ambedkar, launched, the, navayana, tradition, literally, new, vehicle, ambedkar, s, buddhism, rejects, the, foundational, doctrines, and, historic, practices, of,

of, navayana, buddhism, in, india, the, thai, king, mongkut, r, 1851, 68, and, his, son, chulalongkorn, r, 1868, 1910, were, responsible, for, modern, reforms, of, thai, buddhism, modern, buddhist,

sei, kai, or, soka, gakkai, some, of, these, movements, have, brought, internal, disputes, and, strife, within, regional, buddhist, communities, for, example, the, dhammakaya, movement, in, thailand, teaches, a, true, self, doctrine, which, traditional, theravada, monks, consider, as, heretically, denying, the, fundamental, anatta, not, self, doctrine, of, buddhism, buddhism, has, not, been, immune, from, sexual, abuse, and, misconduct, scandals, with, victims, coming, forward, in, various, buddhist, schools, such, as, zen, and, tibetan, there, are, huge, cover, ups, in, the, catholic, church, but, what, has, happened, within, tibetan, buddhism, is, totally, along, the, same, lines, says, mary, finnigan, an, author, and, journalist, who, has, been, chronicling, such, alleged, abuses, since, the, mid, 80s, one, notably, covered, case, in, media, of, various, western, countries, was, that, of, sogyal, rinpoche, which, began, in, 1994, and, ended, with, his, retirement, from, his, position, as, rigpa, s, spiritual, director, in, 2017, there, is, consensus, among, religious, studies, scholars, that, buddhism, is, a, religion, however, buddhism, has, posed, problems, to, western, scholars, of, religion, who, define, religion, based, solely, on, a, theistic, conception, further, some, western, buddhists, and, commentators, like, alan, watts, maintain, that, buddhism, does, not, constitute, a, religion, but, rather, a, philosophy, a, psychotherapy, or, a, way, of, life, this, conception, is, rooted, in, 19th, century, orientalist, writers, such, as, theosophist, henry, steel, olcott, which, reinterpreted, buddhism, in, a, protestant, lens, and, viewed, buddhism, in, asia, as, representing, a, debased, religious, form, of, what, was, originally, non, religious, and, rational, some, buddhist, teachers, and, commentators, such, as, dharmavidya, david, brazier, have, criticized, the, persistence, of, this, view, among, buddhists, in, sri, lanka,
