hathor, ancient, egyptian, wt, r, lit, house, of, horus, ancient, greek, hath, r, coptic, meroitic, atari, was, a, major, goddess, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, who, played, a, wide, variety, of, roles, as, a, sky, deity, she, was, the, mother, or, consort, of, the, sky, god, horus, and, the, sun, god, ra, both, of, whom, were, connected, with, kingship, and, thus, she, was, the, symbolic, mother, of, their, earthly, representatives, the, pharaohs, she, was, one, of, several, goddesses, who, acted, as, the, eye, of, ra, ra, s, feminine, counterpart, and, in, this, form, she, had, a, vengeful, aspect, that, protected, him, from, his, enemies, her, beneficent, side, represented, music, dance, joy, love, sexuality, and, maternal, care, and, she, acted, as, the, consort, of, several, male, deities, and, the, mother, of, their, sons, these, two, aspects, of, the, goddess, exemplified, the, egyptian, conception, of, femininity, hathor, crossed, boundaries, between, worlds, helping, deceased, souls, in, the, transition, to, the, afterlife, hathor, was, often, depicted, as, a, cow, symbolizing, her, maternal, and, celestial, aspect, although, her, most, common, form, was, a, woman, wearing, a, headdress, of, cow, horns, and, a, sun, disk, she, could, also, be, represented, as, a, lioness, a, cobra, or, a, sycamore, tree, cattle, goddesses, similar, to, hathor, were, portrayed, in, egyptian, art, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, but, she, may, not, have, appeared, until, the, old, kingdom, c, 2686, 2181, bc, with, the, patronage, of, old, kingdom, rulers, she, became, one, of, egypt, s, most, important, deities, more, temples, were, dedicated, to, her, than, to, any, other, goddess, her, most, prominent, temple, was, dendera, in, upper, egypt, she, was, also, worshipped, in, the, temples, of, her, male, consorts, the, egyptians, connected, her, with, foreign, lands, such, as, nubia, and, canaan, and, their, valuable, goods, such, as, incense, and, semiprecious, stones, and, some, of, the, peoples, in, those, lands, adopted, her, worship, in, egypt, she, was, one, of, the, deities, commonly, invoked, in, private, prayers, and, votive, offerings, particularly, by, women, desiring, children, during, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, 1070, bc, goddesses, such, as, mut, and, isis, encroached, on, hathor, s, position, in, royal, ideology, but, she, remained, one, of, the, most, widely, worshipped, deities, after, the, end, of, the, new, kingdom, hathor, was, increasingly, overshadowed, by, isis, but, she, continued, to, be, venerated, until, the, extinction, of, ancient, egyptian, religion, in, the, early, centuries, ad, images, of, cattle, appear, frequently, in, the, artwork, of, predynastic, egypt, before, c, 3100, bc, as, do, images, of, women, with, upraised, curved, arms, reminiscent, of, the, shape, of, bovine, horns, both, types, of, imagery, may, represent, goddesses, connected, with, cattle, cows, are, venerated, in, many, cultures, including, ancient, egypt, as, symbols, of, motherhood, and, nourishment, because, they, care, for, their, calves, and, provide, humans, with, milk, the, gerzeh, palette, a, stone, palette, from, the, naqada, ii, period, of, prehistory, c, 3500, 3200, bc, shows, the, silhouette, of, a, cow, s, head, with, inward, curving, horns, surrounded, by, stars, the, palette, suggests, that, this, cow, was, also, linked, with, the, sky, as, were, several, goddesses, from, later, times, who, were, represented, in, this, form, hathor, mehet, weret, and, nut, despite, these, earlier, precedents, hathor, is, not, unambiguously, mentioned, or, depicted, until, the, fourth, dynasty, c, 2613, 2494, bc, of, the, old, kingdom, although, several, artifacts, that, refer, to, her, may, date, to, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 3100, 2686, bc, when, hathor, does, clearly, appear, her, horns, curve, outward, rather, than, inward, like, those, in, predynastic, art, a, bovine, deity, with, inward, curving, horns, appears, on, the, narmer, palette, from, near, the, start, of, egyptian, history, both, atop, the, palette, and, on, the, belt, or, apron, of, the, king, narmer, the, egyptologist, henry, george, fischer, suggested, this, deity, may, be, bat, a, goddess, who, was, later, depicted, with, a, woman, s, face, and, inward, curling, horns, seemingly, reflecting, the, curve, of, the, cow, horns, the, egyptologist, lana, troy, however, identifies, a, passage, in, the, pyramid, texts, from, the, late, old, kingdom, that, connects, hathor, with, the, apron, of, the, king, reminiscent, of, the, goddess, on, narmer, s, garments, and, suggests, the, goddess, on, the, narmer, palette, is, hathor, rather, than, bat, in, the, fourth, dynasty, hathor, rose, rapidly, to, prominence, she, supplanted, an, early, crocodile, god, who, was, worshipped, at, dendera, in, upper, egypt, to, become, dendera, s, patron, deity, and, she, increasingly, absorbed, the, cult, of, bat, in, the, neighboring, region, of, hu, so, that, in, the, middle, kingdom, c, 2055, 1650, bc, the, two, deities, fused, into, one, the, theology, surrounding, the, pharaoh, in, the, old, kingdom, unlike, that, of, earlier, times, focused, heavily, on, the, sun, god, ra, as, king, of, the, gods, and, father, and, patron, of, the, earthly, king, hathor, ascended, with, ra, and, became, his, mythological, wife, and, thus, divine, mother, of, the, pharaoh, hathor, took, many, forms, and, appeared, in, a, wide, variety, of, roles, the, egyptologist, robyn, gillam, suggests, that, these, diverse, forms, emerged, when, the, royal, goddess, promoted, by, the, old, kingdom, court, subsumed, many, local, goddesses, worshipped, by, the, general, populace, who, were, then, treated, as, manifestations, of, her, egyptian, texts, often, speak, of, the, manifestations, of, the, goddess, as, seven, hathors, or, less, commonly, of, many, more, hathors, as, many, as, 362, for, these, reasons, gillam, calls, her, a, type, of, deity, rather, than, a, single, entity, hathor, s, diversity, reflects, the, range, of, traits, that, the, egyptians, associated, with, goddesses, more, than, any, other, deity, she, exemplifies, the, egyptian, perception, of, femininity, hathor, was, given, the, epithets, mistress, of, the, sky, and, mistress, of, the, stars, and, was, said, to, dwell, in, the, sky, with, ra, and, other, sun, deities, egyptians, thought, of, the, sky, as, a, body, of, water, through, which, the, sun, god, sailed, and, they, connected, it, with, the, waters, from, which, according, to, their, creation, myths, the, sun, emerged, at, the, beginning, of, time, this, cosmic, mother, goddess, was, often, represented, as, a, cow, hathor, and, mehet, weret, were, both, thought, of, as, the, cow, who, birthed, the, sun, god, and, placed, him, between, her, horns, like, nut, hathor, was, said, to, give, birth, to, the, sun, god, each, dawn, hathor, s, egyptian, name, was, wt, rw, or, wt, r, it, is, typically, translated, house, of, horus, but, can, also, be, rendered, as, my, house, is, the, sky, the, falcon, god, horus, represented, among, other, things, the, sun, and, sky, the, house, referred, to, may, be, the, sky, in, which, horus, lives, or, the, goddess, s, womb, from, which, he, as, a, sun, god, is, born, each, day, hathor, was, a, solar, deity, a, feminine, counterpart, to, sun, gods, such, as, horus, and, ra, and, was, a, member, of, the, divine, entourage, that, accompanied, ra, as, he, sailed, through, the, sky, in, his, barque, she, was, commonly, called, the, golden, one, referring, to, the, radiance, of, the, sun, and, texts, from, her, temple, at, dendera, say, her, rays, illuminate, the, whole, earth, she, was, sometimes, fused, with, another, goddess, nebethetepet, whose, name, can, mean, lady, of, the, offering, lady, of, contentment, or, lady, of, the, vulva, at, ra, s, cult, center, of, heliopolis, hathor, nebethetepet, was, worshipped, as, his, consort, and, the, egyptologist, rudolf, anthes, argued, that, hathor, s, name, referred, to, a, mythical, house, of, horus, at, heliopolis, that, was, connected, with, the, ideology, of, kingship, she, was, one, of, many, goddesses, to, take, the, role, of, the, eye, of, ra, a, feminine, personification, of, the, disk, of, the, sun, and, an, extension, of, ra, s, own, power, ra, was, sometimes, portrayed, inside, the, disk, which, troy, interprets, as, meaning, that, the, eye, goddess, was, thought, of, as, a, womb, from, which, the, sun, god, was, born, hathor, s, seemingly, contradictory, roles, as, mother, wife, and, daughter, of, ra, reflected, the, daily, cycle, of, the, sun, at, sunset, the, god, entered, the, body, of, the, sky, goddess, impregnating, her, and, fathering, the, deities, born, from, her, womb, at, sunrise, himself, and, the, eye, goddess, who, would, later, give, birth, to, him, ra, gave, rise, to, his, daughter, the, eye, goddess, who, in, turn, gave, rise, to, him, her, son, in, a, cycle, of, constant, regeneration, the, eye, of, ra, protected, the, sun, god, from, his, enemies, and, was, often, represented, as, a, uraeus, or, rearing, cobra, or, as, a, lioness, a, form, of, the, eye, of, ra, known, as, hathor, of, the, four, faces, represented, by, a, set, of, four, cobras, was, said, to, face, in, each, of, the, cardinal, directions, to, watch, for, threats, to, the, sun, god, a, group, of, myths, known, from, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, 1070, bc, onward, describe, what, happens, when, the, eye, goddess, rampages, uncontrolled, in, the, funerary, text, known, as, the, book, of, the, heavenly, cow, ra, sends, hathor, as, the, eye, of, ra, to, punish, humans, for, plotting, rebellion, against, his, rule, she, becomes, the, lioness, goddess, sekhmet, and, massacres, the, rebellious, humans, but, ra, decides, to, prevent, her, from, killing, all, humanity, he, orders, that, beer, be, dyed, red, and, poured, out, over, the, land, the, eye, goddess, drinks, the, beer, mistaking, it, for, blood, and, in, her, inebriated, state, reverts, to, being, the, benign, and, beautiful, hathor, related, to, this, story, is, the, myth, of, the, distant, goddess, from, the, late, and, ptolemaic, periods, the, eye, goddess, sometimes, in, the, form, of, hathor, rebels, against, ra, s, control, and, rampages, freely, in, a, foreign, land, libya, west, of, egypt, or, nubia, to, the, south, weakened, by, the, loss, of, his, eye, ra, sends, another, god, such, as, thoth, to, bring, her, back, to, him, once, pacified, the, goddess, returns, to, become, the, consort, of, the, sun, god, or, of, the, god, who, brings, her, back, the, two, aspects, of, the, eye, goddess, violent, and, dangerous, versus, beautiful, and, joyful, reflected, the, egyptian, belief, that, women, as, the, egyptologist, carolyn, graves, brown, puts, it, encompassed, both, extreme, passions, of, fury, and, love, egyptian, religion, celebrated, the, sensory, pleasures, of, life, believed, to, be, among, the, gods, gifts, to, humanity, egyptians, ate, drank, danced, and, played, music, at, their, religious, festivals, they, perfumed, the, air, with, flowers, and, incense, many, of, hathor, s, epithets, link, her, to, celebration, she, is, called, the, mistress, of, music, dance, garlands, myrrh, and, drunkenness, in, hymns, and, temple, reliefs, musicians, play, tambourines, harps, lyres, and, sistra, in, hathor, s, honor, the, sistrum, a, rattle, like, instrument, was, particularly, important, in, hathor, s, worship, sistra, had, erotic, connotations, and, by, extension, alluded, to, the, creation, of, new, life, these, aspects, of, hathor, were, linked, with, the, myth, of, the, eye, of, ra, the, eye, was, pacified, by, beer, in, the, story, of, the, destruction, of, mankind, in, some, versions, of, the, distant, goddess, myth, the, wandering, eye, s, wildness, abated, when, she, was, appeased, with, products, of, civilization, like, music, dance, and, wine, the, water, of, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, colored, red, by, sediment, was, likened, to, wine, and, to, the, red, dyed, beer, in, the, destruction, of, mankind, festivals, during, the, inundation, therefore, incorporated, drink, music, and, dance, as, a, way, to, appease, the, returning, goddess, a, text, from, the, temple, of, edfu, says, of, hathor, the, gods, play, the, sistrum, for, her, the, goddesses, dance, for, her, to, dispel, her, bad, temper, a, hymn, to, the, goddess, raet, tawy, as, a, form, of, hathor, at, the, temple, of, medamud, describes, the, festival, of, drunkenness, tekh, festival, as, part, of, her, mythic, return, to, egypt, women, carry, bouquets, of, flowers, drunken, revelers, play, drums, and, people, and, animals, from, foreign, lands, dance, for, her, as, she, enters, the, temple, s, festival, booth, the, noise, of, the, celebration, drives, away, hostile, powers, and, ensures, the, goddess, will, remain, in, her, joyful, form, as, she, awaits, the, male, god, of, the, temple, her, mythological, consort, montu, whose, son, she, will, bear, hathor, s, joyful, ecstatic, side, indicates, her, feminine, procreative, power, in, some, creation, myths, she, helped, produce, the, world, itself, atum, a, creator, god, who, contained, all, things, within, himself, was, said, to, have, produced, his, children, shu, and, tefnut, and, thus, begun, the, process, of, creation, by, masturbating, the, hand, he, used, for, this, act, the, hand, of, atum, represented, the, female, aspect, of, himself, and, could, be, personified, by, hathor, nebethetepet, or, another, goddess, iusaaset, in, a, late, creation, myth, from, the, ptolemaic, period, 332, 30, bc, the, god, khonsu, is, put, in, a, central, role, and, hathor, is, the, goddess, with, whom, khonsu, mates, to, enable, creation, hathor, could, be, the, consort, of, many, male, gods, of, whom, ra, was, only, the, most, prominent, mut, was, the, usual, consort, of, amun, the, preeminent, deity, during, the, new, kingdom, who, was, often, linked, with, ra, but, mut, was, rarely, portrayed, alongside, amun, in, contexts, related, to, sex, or, fertility, and, in, those, circumstances, hathor, or, isis, stood, at, his, side, instead, in, the, late, periods, of, egyptian, history, the, form, of, hathor, from, dendera, and, the, form, of, horus, from, edfu, were, considered, husband, and, wife, and, in, different, versions, of, the, myth, of, the, distant, goddess, hathor, raettawy, was, the, consort, of, montu, and, hathor, tefnut, the, consort, of, shu, hathor, s, sexual, side, was, seen, in, some, short, stories, in, a, cryptic, fragment, of, a, middle, kingdom, story, known, as, the, tale, of, the, herdsman, a, herdsman, encounters, a, hairy, animal, like, goddess, in, a, marsh, and, reacts, with, terror, on, another, day, he, encounters, her, as, a, nude, alluring, woman, most, egyptologists, who, study, this, story, think, this, woman, is, hathor, or, a, goddess, like, her, one, who, can, be, wild, and, dangerous, or, benign, and, erotic, thomas, schneider, interprets, the, text, as, implying, that, between, his, two, encounters, with, the, goddess, the, herdsman, has, done, something, to, pacify, her, in, the, contendings, of, horus, and, set, a, new, kingdom, short, story, about, the, dispute, between, those, two, gods, ra, is, upset, after, being, insulted, by, another, god, babi, and, lies, on, his, back, alone, after, some, time, hathor, exposes, her, genitals, to, ra, making, him, laugh, and, get, up, again, to, perform, his, duties, as, ruler, of, the, gods, life, and, order, were, thought, to, be, dependent, on, ra, s, activity, and, the, story, implies, that, hathor, averted, the, disastrous, consequences, of, his, idleness, her, act, may, have, lifted, ra, s, spirits, partly, because, it, sexually, aroused, him, although, why, he, laughed, is, not, fully, understood, hathor, was, praised, for, her, beautiful, hair, egyptian, literature, contains, allusions, to, a, myth, not, clearly, described, in, any, surviving, texts, in, which, hathor, lost, a, lock, of, hair, that, represented, her, sexual, allure, one, text, compares, this, loss, with, horus, s, loss, of, his, divine, eye, and, set, s, loss, of, his, testicles, during, the, struggle, between, the, two, gods, implying, that, the, loss, of, hathor, s, lock, was, as, catastrophic, for, her, as, the, maiming, of, horus, and, set, was, for, them, hathor, was, called, mistress, of, love, as, an, extension, of, her, sexual, aspect, in, the, series, of, love, poems, from, papyrus, chester, beatty, i, from, the, twentieth, dynasty, c, 1189, 1077, bc, men, and, women, ask, hathor, to, bring, their, lovers, to, them, i, prayed, to, her, and, she, heard, my, prayer, she, destined, my, mistress, for, me, and, she, came, of, her, own, free, will, to, see, me, hathor, was, considered, the, mother, of, various, child, deities, as, suggested, by, her, name, she, was, often, thought, of, as, both, horus, s, mother, and, consort, as, both, the, king, s, wife, and, his, heir, s, mother, hathor, was, the, divine, counterpart, of, human, queens, isis, and, osiris, were, considered, horus, s, parents, in, the, osiris, myth, as, far, back, as, the, late, old, kingdom, but, the, relationship, between, horus, and, hathor, may, be, older, still, if, so, horus, only, came, to, be, linked, with, isis, and, osiris, as, the, osiris, myth, emerged, during, the, old, kingdom, even, after, isis, was, firmly, established, as, horus, s, mother, hathor, continued, to, appear, in, this, role, especially, when, nursing, the, pharaoh, images, of, the, hathor, cow, with, a, child, in, a, papyrus, thicket, represented, his, mythological, upbringing, in, a, secluded, marsh, goddesses, milk, was, a, sign, of, divinity, and, royal, status, thus, images, in, which, hathor, nurses, the, pharaoh, represent, his, right, to, rule, hathor, s, relationship, with, horus, gave, a, healing, aspect, to, her, character, as, she, was, said, to, have, restored, horus, s, missing, eye, or, eyes, after, set, attacked, him, in, the, version, of, this, episode, in, the, contendings, of, horus, and, set, hathor, finds, horus, with, his, eyes, torn, out, and, heals, the, wounds, with, gazelle, s, milk, beginning, in, the, late, period, 664, 323, bc, temples, focused, on, the, worship, of, a, divine, family, an, adult, male, deity, his, wife, and, their, immature, son, satellite, buildings, known, as, mammisis, were, built, in, celebration, of, the, birth, of, the, local, child, deity, the, child, god, represented, the, cyclical, renewal, of, the, cosmos, and, an, archetypal, heir, to, the, kingship, hathor, was, the, mother, in, many, of, these, local, divine, triads, at, dendera, the, mature, horus, of, edfu, was, the, father, and, hathor, the, mother, while, their, child, was, ihy, a, god, whose, name, meant, sistrum, player, and, who, personified, the, jubilation, associated, with, the, instrument, at, kom, ombo, hathor, s, local, form, tasenetnofret, was, mother, to, horus, s, son, panebtawy, other, children, of, hathor, included, a, minor, deity, from, the, town, of, hu, named, neferhotep, and, several, child, forms, of, horus, the, milky, sap, of, the, sycamore, tree, which, the, egyptians, regarded, as, a, symbol, of, life, became, one, of, her, symbols, the, milk, was, equated, with, water, of, the, nile, inundation, and, thus, fertility, in, the, late, ptolemaic, and, roman, periods, many, temples, contained, a, creation, myth, that, adapted, long, standing, ideas, about, creation, the, version, from, hathor, s, temple, at, dendera, emphasizes, that, she, as, a, female, solar, deity, was, the, first, being, to, emerge, from, the, primordial, waters, that, preceded, creation, and, her, life, giving, light, and, milk, nourished, all, living, things, hathor, s, maternal, aspects, can, be, compared, with, those, of, isis, and, mut, yet, there, are, many, contrasts, between, them, isis, s, devotion, to, her, husband, and, care, for, their, child, represented, a, more, socially, acceptable, form, of, love, than, hathor, s, uninhibited, sexuality, and, mut, s, character, was, more, authoritative, than, sexual, the, text, of, the, 1st, century, ce, insinger, papyrus, likens, a, faithful, wife, the, mistress, of, a, household, to, mut, while, comparing, hathor, to, a, strange, woman, who, tempts, a, married, man, like, meskhenet, another, goddess, who, presided, over, birth, hathor, was, connected, with, shai, the, egyptian, concept, of, fate, particularly, when, she, took, the, form, of, the, seven, hathors, in, two, new, kingdom, works, of, fiction, the, tale, of, two, brothers, and, the, tale, of, the, doomed, prince, the, hathors, appear, at, the, births, of, major, characters, and, foretell, the, manner, of, their, deaths, the, egyptians, tended, to, think, of, fate, as, inexorable, yet, in, the, tale, of, the, doomed, prince, the, prince, who, is, its, protagonist, is, able, to, escape, one, of, the, possible, violent, deaths, that, the, seven, hathors, have, foretold, for, him, and, while, the, end, of, the, story, is, missing, the, surviving, portions, imply, that, the, prince, can, escape, his, fate, with, the, help, of, the, gods, hathor, was, connected, with, trade, and, foreign, lands, possibly, because, her, role, as, a, sky, goddess, linked, her, with, stars, and, hence, navigation, and, because, she, was, believed, to, protect, ships, on, the, nile, and, in, the, seas, beyond, egypt, as, she, protected, the, barque, of, ra, in, the, sky, the, mythological, wandering, of, the, eye, goddess, in, nubia, or, libya, gave, her, a, connection, with, those, lands, as, well, egypt, maintained, trade, relations, with, the, coastal, cities, of, syria, and, canaan, particularly, byblos, placing, egyptian, religion, in, contact, with, the, religions, of, that, region, at, some, point, perhaps, as, early, as, the, old, kingdom, the, egyptians, began, to, refer, to, the, patron, goddess, of, byblos, baalat, gebal, as, a, local, form, of, hathor, so, strong, was, hathor, s, link, to, byblos, that, texts, from, dendera, say, she, resided, there, the, egyptians, sometimes, equated, anat, an, aggressive, canaanite, goddess, who, came, to, be, worshipped, in, egypt, during, the, new, kingdom, with, hathor, some, canaanite, artworks, depict, a, nude, goddess, with, a, curling, wig, taken, from, hathor, s, iconography, which, goddess, these, images, represent, is, not, known, but, the, egyptians, adopted, her, iconography, and, came, to, regard, her, as, an, independent, deity, qetesh, whom, they, associated, with, hathor, hathor, was, closely, connected, with, the, sinai, peninsula, which, was, not, considered, part, of, egypt, proper, but, was, the, site, of, egyptian, mines, for, copper, turquoise, and, malachite, during, the, middle, and, new, kingdoms, one, of, hathor, s, epithets, lady, of, mefkat, may, have, referred, specifically, to, turquoise, or, to, all, blue, green, minerals, she, was, also, called, lady, of, faience, a, blue, green, ceramic, that, egyptians, likened, to, turquoise, hathor, was, also, worshipped, at, various, quarries, and, mining, sites, in, egypt, s, eastern, desert, such, as, the, amethyst, mines, of, wadi, el, hudi, where, she, was, sometimes, called, lady, of, amethyst, south, of, egypt, hathor, s, influence, was, thought, to, have, extended, over, the, land, of, punt, which, lay, along, the, red, sea, coast, and, was, a, major, source, for, the, incense, with, which, hathor, was, linked, as, well, as, with, nubia, northwest, of, punt, the, autobiography, of, harkhuf, an, official, in, the, sixth, dynasty, c, 2345, 2181, bc, describes, his, expedition, to, a, land, in, or, near, nubia, from, which, he, brought, back, great, quantities, of, ebony, panther, skins, and, incense, for, the, king, the, text, describes, these, exotic, goods, as, hathor, s, gift, to, the, pharaoh, egyptian, expeditions, to, mine, gold, in, nubia, introduced, her, cult, to, the, region, during, the, middle, and, new, kingdoms, and, new, kingdom, pharaohs, built, several, temples, to, her, in, the, portions, of, nubia, that, they, ruled, although, the, pyramid, texts, the, earliest, egyptian, funerary, texts, rarely, mention, her, hathor, was, invoked, in, private, tomb, inscriptions, from, the, same, era, and, in, the, middle, kingdom, coffin, texts, and, later, sources, she, is, frequently, linked, with, the, afterlife, just, as, she, crossed, the, boundary, between, egypt, and, foreign, lands, hathor, passed, through, the, boundary, between, the, living, and, the, duat, the, realm, of, the, dead, she, helped, the, spirits, of, deceased, humans, enter, the, duat, and, was, closely, linked, with, tomb, sites, where, that, transition, began, the, necropolises, or, clusters, of, tombs, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, were, personified, as, imentet, the, goddess, of, the, west, who, was, frequently, regarded, as, a, manifestation, of, hathor, the, theban, necropolis, for, example, was, often, portrayed, as, a, stylized, mountain, with, the, cow, of, hathor, emerging, from, it, her, role, as, a, sky, goddess, was, also, linked, to, the, afterlife, because, the, sky, goddess, either, nut, or, hathor, assisted, ra, in, his, daily, rebirth, she, had, an, important, part, in, ancient, egyptian, afterlife, beliefs, according, to, which, deceased, humans, were, reborn, like, the, sun, god, coffins, tombs, and, the, underworld, itself, were, interpreted, as, the, womb, of, this, goddess, from, which, the, deceased, soul, would, be, reborn, nut, hathor, and, imentet, could, each, in, different, texts, lead, the, deceased, into, a, place, where, they, would, receive, food, and, drink, for, eternal, sustenance, thus, hathor, as, imentet, often, appears, on, tombs, welcoming, the, deceased, person, as, her, child, into, a, blissful, afterlife, in, new, kingdom, funerary, texts, and, artwork, the, afterlife, was, often, illustrated, as, a, pleasant, fertile, garden, over, which, hathor, sometimes, presided, the, welcoming, afterlife, goddess, was, often, portrayed, as, a, goddess, in, the, form, of, a, tree, giving, water, to, the, deceased, nut, most, commonly, filled, this, role, but, the, tree, goddess, was, sometimes, called, hathor, instead, the, afterlife, also, had, a, sexual, aspect, in, the, osiris, myth, the, murdered, god, osiris, was, resurrected, when, he, copulated, with, isis, and, conceived, horus, in, solar, ideology, ra, s, union, with, the, sky, goddess, allowed, his, own, rebirth, sex, therefore, enabled, the, rebirth, of, the, deceased, and, goddesses, like, isis, and, hathor, served, to, rouse, the, deceased, to, new, life, but, they, merely, stimulated, the, male, deities, regenerative, powers, rather, than, playing, the, central, role, ancient, egyptians, prefixed, the, names, of, the, deceased, with, osiris, s, name, to, connect, them, with, his, resurrection, for, example, a, woman, named, henutmehyt, would, be, dubbed, osiris, henutmehyt, over, time, they, increasingly, associated, the, deceased, with, both, male, and, female, divine, powers, as, early, as, the, late, old, kingdom, women, were, sometimes, said, to, join, the, worshippers, of, hathor, in, the, afterlife, just, as, men, joined, the, following, of, osiris, in, the, third, intermediate, period, c, 1070, 664, bc, egyptians, began, to, add, hathor, s, name, to, that, of, deceased, women, in, place, of, that, of, osiris, in, some, cases, women, were, called, osiris, hathor, indicating, that, they, benefited, from, the, revivifying, power, of, both, deities, in, these, late, periods, hathor, was, sometimes, said, to, rule, the, afterlife, as, osiris, did, hathor, was, often, depicted, as, a, cow, bearing, the, sun, disk, between, her, horns, especially, when, shown, nursing, the, king, she, could, also, appear, as, a, woman, with, the, head, of, a, cow, her, most, common, form, however, was, a, woman, wearing, a, headdress, of, the, horns, and, sun, disk, often, with, a, red, or, turquoise, sheath, dress, or, a, dress, combining, both, colors, sometimes, the, horns, stood, atop, a, low, modius, or, the, vulture, headdress, that, egyptian, queens, often, wore, in, the, new, kingdom, because, isis, adopted, the, same, headdress, during, the, new, kingdom, the, two, goddesses, can, be, distinguished, only, if, labeled, in, writing, when, in, the, role, of, imentet, hathor, wore, the, emblem, of, the, west, upon, her, head, instead, of, the, horned, headdress, the, seven, hathors, were, sometimes, portrayed, as, a, set, of, seven, cows, accompanied, by, a, minor, sky, and, afterlife, deity, called, the, bull, of, the, west, some, animals, other, than, cattle, could, represent, hathor, the, uraeus, was, a, common, motif, in, egyptian, art, and, could, represent, a, variety, of, goddesses, who, were, identified, with, the, eye, of, ra, when, hathor, was, depicted, as, a, uraeus, it, represented, the, ferocious, and, protective, aspects, of, her, character, she, also, appeared, as, a, lioness, and, this, form, had, a, similar, meaning, in, contrast, the, domestic, cat, which, was, sometimes, connected, with, hathor, often, represented, the, eye, goddess, s, pacified, form, when, portrayed, as, a, sycamore, tree, hathor, was, usually, shown, with, the, upper, body, of, her, human, form, emerging, from, the, trunk, like, other, goddesses, hathor, might, carry, a, stalk, of, papyrus, as, a, staff, though, she, could, instead, hold, a, was, staff, a, symbol, of, power, that, was, usually, restricted, to, male, deities, the, only, goddesses, who, used, the, was, were, those, like, hathor, who, were, linked, with, the, eye, of, ra, she, also, commonly, carried, a, sistrum, or, a, menat, necklace, the, sistrum, came, in, two, varieties, a, simple, loop, shape, or, the, more, complex, naos, sistrum, which, was, shaped, to, resemble, a, naos, shrine, and, flanked, by, volutes, resembling, the, antennae, of, the, bat, emblem, mirrors, were, another, of, her, symbols, because, in, egypt, they, were, often, made, of, gold, or, bronze, and, therefore, symbolized, the, sun, disk, and, because, they, were, connected, with, beauty, and, femininity, some, mirror, handles, were, made, in, the, shape, of, hathor, s, face, the, menat, necklace, made, up, of, many, strands, of, beads, was, shaken, in, ceremonies, in, hathor, s, honor, similarly, to, the, sistrum, images, of, it, were, sometimes, seen, as, personifications, of, hathor, herself, hathor, was, sometimes, represented, as, a, human, face, with, bovine, ears, seen, from, the, front, rather, than, in, the, profile, based, perspective, that, was, typical, of, egyptian, art, when, she, appears, in, this, form, the, tresses, on, either, side, of, her, face, often, curl, into, loops, this, mask, like, face, was, placed, on, the, capitals, of, columns, beginning, in, the, late, old, kingdom, columns, of, this, style, were, used, in, many, temples, to, hathor, and, other, goddesses, these, columns, have, two, or, four, faces, which, may, represent, the, duality, between, different, aspects, of, the, goddess, or, the, watchfulness, of, hathor, of, the, four, faces, the, designs, of, hathoric, columns, have, a, complex, relationship, with, those, of, sistra, both, styles, of, sistrum, can, bear, the, hathor, mask, on, the, handle, and, hathoric, columns, often, incorporate, the, naos, sistrum, shape, above, the, goddess, s, head, during, the, early, dynastic, period, neith, was, the, preeminent, goddess, at, the, royal, court, while, in, the, fourth, dynasty, hathor, became, the, goddess, most, closely, linked, with, the, king, sneferu, the, founder, of, the, fourth, dynasty, may, have, built, a, temple, to, her, and, neferhetepes, a, daughter, of, djedefra, was, the, first, recorded, priestess, of, hathor, old, kingdom, rulers, donated, resources, only, to, temples, dedicated, to, particular, kings, or, to, deities, closely, connected, with, kingship, hathor, was, one, of, the, few, deities, to, receive, such, donations, late, old, kingdom, rulers, especially, promoted, the, cult, of, hathor, in, the, provinces, as, a, way, of, binding, those, regions, to, the, royal, court, she, may, have, absorbed, the, traits, of, contemporary, provincial, goddesses, many, female, royals, though, not, reigning, queens, held, positions, in, the, cult, during, the, old, kingdom, mentuhotep, ii, who, became, the, first, pharaoh, of, the, middle, kingdom, despite, having, no, relation, to, the, old, kingdom, rulers, sought, to, legitimize, his, rule, by, portraying, himself, as, hathor, s, son, the, first, images, of, the, hathor, cow, suckling, the, king, date, to, his, reign, and, several, priestesses, of, hathor, were, depicted, as, though, they, were, his, wives, although, he, may, not, have, actually, married, them, in, the, course, of, the, middle, kingdom, queens, were, increasingly, seen, as, directly, embodying, the, goddess, just, as, the, king, embodied, ra, the, emphasis, on, the, queen, as, hathor, continued, through, the, new, kingdom, queens, were, portrayed, with, the, headdress, of, hathor, beginning, in, the, late, eighteenth, dynasty, an, image, of, the, sed, festival, of, amenhotep, iii, meant, to, celebrate, and, renew, his, rule, shows, the, king, together, with, hathor, and, his, queen, tiye, which, could, mean, that, the, king, symbolically, married, the, goddess, in, the, course, of, the, festival, hatshepsut, a, woman, who, ruled, as, a, pharaoh, in, the, early, new, kingdom, emphasized, her, relationship, to, hathor, in, a, different, way, she, used, names, and, titles, that, linked, her, to, a, variety, of, goddesses, including, hathor, so, as, to, legitimize, her, rule, in, what, was, normally, a, male, position, she, built, several, temples, to, hathor, and, placed, her, own, mortuary, temple, which, incorporated, a, chapel, dedicated, to, the, goddess, at, deir, el, bahari, which, had, been, a, cult, site, of, hathor, since, the, middle, kingdom, the, preeminence, of, amun, during, the, new, kingdom, gave, greater, visibility, to, his, consort, mut, and, in, the, course, of, the, period, isis, began, appearing, in, roles, that, traditionally, belonged, to, hathor, alone, such, as, that, of, the, goddess, in, the, solar, barque, despite, the, growing, prominence, of, these, deities, hathor, remained, important, particularly, in, relation, to, fertility, sexuality, and, queenship, throughout, the, new, kingdom, after, the, new, kingdom, isis, increasingly, overshadowed, hathor, and, other, goddesses, as, she, took, on, their, characteristics, in, the, ptolemaic, period, 305, 30, bc, when, greeks, governed, egypt, and, their, religion, developed, a, complex, relationship, with, that, of, egypt, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, adopted, and, modified, the, egyptian, ideology, of, kingship, beginning, with, arsinoe, ii, wife, of, ptolemy, ii, the, ptolemies, closely, linked, their, queens, with, isis, and, with, several, greek, goddesses, particularly, their, own, goddess, of, love, and, sexuality, aphrodite, nevertheless, when, the, greeks, referred, to, egyptian, gods, by, the, names, of, their, own, gods, a, practice, called, interpretatio, graeca, they, sometimes, called, hathor, aphrodite, traits, of, isis, hathor, and, aphrodite, were, all, combined, to, justify, the, treatment, of, ptolemaic, queens, as, goddesses, thus, the, poet, callimachus, alluded, to, the, myth, of, hathor, s, lost, lock, of, hair, in, the, aetia, when, praising, berenice, ii, for, sacrificing, her, own, hair, to, aphrodite, and, iconographic, traits, that, isis, and, hathor, shared, such, as, the, bovine, horns, and, vulture, headdress, appeared, on, images, portraying, ptolemaic, queens, as, aphrodite, more, temples, were, dedicated, to, hathor, than, to, any, other, egyptian, goddess, during, the, old, kingdom, her, most, important, center, of, worship, was, in, the, region, of, memphis, where, hathor, of, the, sycamore, was, worshipped, at, many, sites, throughout, the, memphite, necropolis, during, the, new, kingdom, era, the, temple, of, hathor, of, the, southern, sycamore, was, her, main, temple, in, memphis, at, that, site, she, was, described, as, the, daughter, of, the, city, s, main, deity, ptah, the, cult, of, ra, and, atum, at, heliopolis, northeast, of, memphis, included, a, temple, to, hathor, nebethetepet, that, was, probably, built, in, the, middle, kingdom, a, willow, and, a, sycamore, tree, stood, near, the, sanctuary, and, may, have, been, worshipped, as, manifestations, of, the, goddess, a, few, cities, farther, north, in, the, nile, delta, such, as, yamu, and, terenuthis, also, had, temples, to, her, dendera, hathor, s, oldest, temple, in, upper, egypt, dates, to, at, least, to, the, fourth, dynasty, after, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, it, surpassed, her, memphite, temples, in, importance, many, kings, made, additions, to, the, temple, complex, through, egyptian, history, the, last, version, of, the, temple, was, built, in, the, ptolemaic, and, roman, periods, and, is, today, one, of, the, best, preserved, egyptian, temples, from, that, time, as, the, rulers, of, the, old, kingdom, made, an, effort, to, develop, towns, in, upper, and, middle, egypt, several, cult, centers, of, hathor, were, founded, across, the, region, at, sites, such, as, cusae, akhmim, and, naga, ed, der, in, the, first, intermediate, period, c, 2181, 2055, bc, her, cult, statue, from, dendera, was, periodically, carried, to, the, theban, necropolis, during, the, beginning, of, the, middle, kingdom, mentuhotep, ii, established, a, permanent, cult, center, for, her, in, the, necropolis, at, deir, el, bahari, the, nearby, village, of, deir, el, medina, home, to, the, tomb, workers, of, the, necropolis, during, the, new, kingdom, also, contained, temples, of, hathor, one, continued, to, function, and, was, periodically, rebuilt, as, late, as, the, ptolemaic, period, centuries, after, the, village, was, abandoned, in, the, old, kingdom, most, priests, of, hathor, including, the, highest, ranks, were, women, many, of, these, women, were, members, of, the, royal, family, in, the, course, of, the, middle, kingdom, women, were, increasingly, excluded, from, the, highest, priestly, positions, at, the, same, time, that, queens, were, becoming, more, closely, tied, to, hathor, s, cult, thus, non, royal, women, disappeared, from, the, high, ranks, of, hathor, s, priesthood, although, women, continued, to, serve, as, musicians, and, singers, in, temple, cults, across, egypt, the, most, frequent, temple, rite, for, any, deity, was, the, daily, offering, ritual, in, which, the, cult, image, or, statue, of, a, deity, would, be, clothed, and, given, food, the, daily, ritual, was, largely, the, same, in, every, egyptian, temple, although, the, goods, given, as, offerings, could, vary, according, to, which, deity, received, them, wine, and, beer, were, common, offerings, in, all, temples, but, especially, in, rituals, in, hathor, s, honor, and, she, and, the, goddesses, related, to, her, often, received, sistra, and, menat, necklaces, in, late, and, ptolemaic, times, they, were, also, offered, a, pair, of, mirrors, representing, the, sun, and, the, moon, many, of, hathor, s, annual, festivals, were, celebrated, with, drinking, and, dancing, that, served, a, ritual, purpose, revelers, at, these, festivals, may, have, aimed, to, reach, a, state, of, religious, ecstasy, which, was, otherwise, rare, or, nonexistent, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, graves, brown, suggests, that, celebrants, in, hathor, s, festivals, aimed, to, reach, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, to, allow, them, interact, with, the, divine, realm, an, example, is, the, festival, of, drunkenness, commemorating, the, return, of, the, eye, of, ra, which, was, celebrated, on, the, twentieth, day, of, the, month, of, thout, at, temples, to, hathor, and, to, other, eye, goddesses, it, was, celebrated, as, early, as, the, middle, kingdom, but, it, is, best, known, from, ptolemaic, and, roman, times, the, dancing, eating, and, drinking, that, took, place, during, the, festival, of, drunkenness, represented, the, opposite, of, the, sorrow, hunger, and, thirst, that, the, egyptians, associated, with, death, whereas, the, rampages, of, the, eye, of, ra, brought, death, to, humans, the, festival, of, drunkenness, celebrated, life, abundance, and, joy, in, a, local, theban, festival, known, as, the, beautiful, festival, of, the, valley, which, began, to, be, celebrated, in, the, middle, kingdom, the, cult, image, of, amun, from, the, temple, of, karnak, visited, the, temples, in, the, theban, necropolis, while, members, of, the, community, went, to, the, tombs, of, their, deceased, relatives, to, drink, eat, and, celebrate, hathor, was, not, involved, in, this, festival, until, the, early, new, kingdom, after, which, amun, s, overnight, stay, in, the, temples, at, deir, el, bahari, came, to, be, seen, as, his, sexual, union, with, her, several, temples, in, ptolemaic, times, including, that, of, dendera, observed, the, egyptian, new, year, with, a, series, of, ceremonies, in, which, images, of, the, temple, deity, were, supposed, to, be, revitalized, by, contact, with, the, sun, god, on, the, days, leading, up, to, the, new, year, dendera, s, statue, of, hathor, was, taken, to, the, wabet, a, specialized, room, in, the, temple, and, placed, under, a, ceiling, decorated, with, images, of, the, sky, and, sun, on, the, first, day, of, the, new, year, the, first, day, of, the, month, of, thoth, the, hathor, image, was, carried, up, to, the, roof, to, be, bathed, in, genuine, sunlight, the, best, documented, festival, focused, on, hathor, is, another, ptolemaic, celebration, the, festival, of, the, beautiful, reunion, it, took, place, over, fourteen, days, in, the, month, of, epiphi, hathor, s, cult, image, from, dendera, was, carried, by, boat, to, several, temple, sites, to, visit, the, gods, of, those, temples, the, endpoint, of, the, journey, was, the, temple, of, horus, at, edfu, where, the, hathor, statue, from, dendera, met, that, of, horus, of, edfu, and, the, two, were, placed, together, on, one, day, of, the, festival, these, images, were, carried, out, to, a, shrine, where, primordial, deities, such, as, the, sun, god, and, the, ennead, were, said, to, be, buried, the, texts, say, the, divine, couple, performed, offering, rites, for, these, entombed, gods, many, egyptologists, regard, this, festival, as, a, ritual, marriage, between, horus, and, hathor, although, martin, stadler, challenges, this, view, arguing, that, it, instead, represented, the, rejuvenation, of, the, buried, creator, gods, c, j, bleeker, thought, the, beautiful, reunion, was, another, celebration, of, the, return, of, the, distant, goddess, citing, allusions, in, the, temple, s, festival, texts, to, the, myth, of, the, solar, eye, barbara, richter, argues, that, the, festival, represented, all, three, things, at, once, she, points, out, that, the, birth, of, horus, and, hathor, s, son, ihy, was, celebrated, at, dendera, nine, months, after, the, festival, of, the, beautiful, reunion, implying, that, hathor, s, visit, to, horus, represented, ihy, s, conception, the, third, month, of, the, egyptian, calendar, hathor, or, athyr, was, named, for, the, goddess, festivities, in, her, honor, took, place, throughout, the, month, although, they, are, not, recorded, in, the, texts, from, dendera, egyptian, kings, as, early, as, the, old, kingdom, donated, goods, to, the, temple, of, baalat, gebal, in, byblos, using, the, syncretism, of, baalat, with, hathor, to, cement, their, close, trading, relationship, with, byblos, a, temple, to, hathor, as, lady, of, byblos, was, built, during, the, reign, of, thutmose, iii, although, it, may, simply, have, been, a, shrine, within, the, temple, of, baalat, after, the, breakdown, of, the, new, kingdom, hathor, s, prominence, in, byblos, diminished, along, with, egypt, s, trade, links, to, the, city, a, few, artifacts, from, the, early, first, millennium, bc, suggest, that, the, egyptians, began, equating, baalat, with, isis, at, that, time, a, myth, about, isis, s, presence, in, byblos, related, by, the, greek, author, plutarch, in, his, work, on, isis, and, osiris, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, suggests, that, by, his, time, isis, had, entirely, supplanted, hathor, in, the, city, a, pendant, found, in, a, mycenaean, tomb, at, pylos, from, the, 16th, century, bc, bears, hathor, s, face, its, presence, in, the, tomb, suggests, the, mycenaeans, may, have, known, that, the, egyptians, connected, hathor, with, the, afterlife, egyptians, in, the, sinai, peninsula, built, a, few, temples, in, the, region, the, largest, was, a, complex, dedicated, primarily, to, hathor, as, patroness, of, mining, at, serabit, el, khadim, on, the, west, side, of, the, peninsula, it, was, occupied, from, the, middle, of, the, middle, kingdom, to, near, the, end, of, the, new, the, timna, valley, on, the, fringes, of, the, egyptian, empire, on, the, east, side, of, the, peninsula, was, the, site, of, seasonal, mining, expeditions, during, the, new, kingdom, it, included, a, shrine, to, hathor, that, was, probably, deserted, during, the, off, season, the, local, midianites, whom, the, egyptians, used, as, part, of, the, mining, workforce, may, have, given, offerings, to, hathor, as, their, overseers, did, after, the, egyptians, abandoned, the, site, in, the, twentieth, dynasty, however, the, midianites, converted, the, shrine, to, a, tent, shrine, devoted, to, their, own, deities, in, contrast, the, nubians, in, the, south, fully, incorporated, hathor, into, their, religion, during, the, new, kingdom, when, most, of, nubia, was, under, egyptian, control, pharaohs, dedicated, several, temples, in, nubia, to, hathor, such, as, those, at, faras, and, mirgissa, amenhotep, iii, and, ramesses, ii, both, built, temples, in, nubia, that, celebrated, their, respective, queens, as, manifestations, of, female, deities, including, hathor, amenhotep, s, wife, tiye, at, sedeinga, and, ramesses, s, wife, nefertari, at, the, small, temple, of, abu, simbel, the, independent, kingdom, of, kush, which, emerged, in, nubia, after, the, collapse, of, the, new, kingdom, based, its, beliefs, about, kushite, kings, on, the, royal, ideology, of, egypt, therefore, hathor, isis, mut, and, nut, were, all, seen, as, the, mythological, mother, of, each, kushite, king, and, equated, with, his, female, relatives, such, as, the, kandake, the, kushite, queen, or, queen, mother, who, had, prominent, roles, in, kushite, religion, at, jebel, barkal, a, site, sacred, to, amun, the, kushite, king, taharqa, built, a, pair, of, temples, one, dedicated, to, hathor, and, one, to, mut, as, consorts, of, amun, replacing, new, kingdom, egyptian, temples, that, may, have, been, dedicated, to, these, same, goddesses, but, isis, was, the, most, prominent, of, the, egyptian, goddesses, worshipped, in, nubia, and, her, status, there, increased, over, time, thus, in, the, meroitic, period, of, nubian, history, c, 300, bc, ad, 400, hathor, appeared, in, temples, mainly, as, a, companion, to, isis, in, addition, to, formal, and, public, rituals, at, temples, egyptians, privately, worshipped, deities, for, personal, reasons, including, at, their, homes, birth, was, hazardous, for, both, mother, and, child, in, ancient, egypt, yet, children, were, much, desired, thus, fertility, and, safe, childbirth, are, among, the, most, prominent, concerns, in, popular, religion, and, fertility, deities, such, as, hathor, and, taweret, were, commonly, worshipped, in, household, shrines, egyptian, women, squatted, on, bricks, while, giving, birth, and, the, only, known, surviving, birth, brick, from, ancient, egypt, is, decorated, with, an, image, of, a, woman, holding, her, child, flanked, by, images, of, hathor, in, roman, times, terracotta, figurines, sometimes, found, in, a, domestic, context, depicted, a, woman, with, an, elaborate, headdress, exposing, her, genitals, as, hathor, did, to, cheer, up, ra, the, meaning, of, these, figurines, is, not, known, but, they, are, often, thought, to, represent, hathor, or, isis, combined, with, aphrodite, making, a, gesture, that, represented, fertility, or, protection, against, evil, hathor, was, one, of, a, handful, of, deities, including, amun, ptah, and, thoth, who, were, commonly, prayed, to, for, help, with, personal, problems, many, egyptians, left, offerings,
