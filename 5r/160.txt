a, schism, s, z, m, siz, m, s, k, z, m, skiz, m, or, less, commonly, z, m, shiz, m, is, a, division, between, people, usually, belonging, to, an, organization, movement, or, religious, denomination, the, word, is, most, frequently, applied, to, a, split, in, what, had, previously, been, a, single, religious, body, such, as, the, great, east, west, schism, or, the, western, schism, it, is, also, used, of, a, split, within, a, non, religious, organization, or, movement, or, more, broadly, of, a, separation, between, two, or, more, people, be, it, brothers, friends, lovers, etc, a, schismatic, is, a, person, who, creates, or, incites, schism, in, an, organization, or, who, is, a, member, of, a, splinter, group, schismatic, as, an, adjective, means, pertaining, to, a, schism, or, schisms, or, to, those, ideas, policies, etc, that, are, thought, to, lead, towards, or, promote, schism, in, religion, the, charge, of, schism, is, distinguished, from, that, of, heresy, since, the, offence, of, schism, concerns, not, differences, of, belief, or, doctrine, but, promotion, of, or, the, state, of, division, especially, among, groups, with, differing, pastoral, jurisdictions, and, authority, however, schisms, frequently, involve, mutual, accusations, of, heresy, and, also, that, of, the, great, apostasy, in, roman, catholic, teaching, every, heresy, is, a, schism, while, there, may, be, some, schisms, free, of, the, added, guilt, of, heresy, liberal, protestantism, however, has, often, preferred, heresy, over, schism, presbyterian, scholar, james, i, mccord, quoted, with, approval, by, the, episcopalian, bishop, of, virginia, peter, lee, drew, a, distinction, between, them, teaching, if, you, must, make, a, choice, between, heresy, and, schism, always, choose, heresy, as, a, schismatic, you, have, torn, and, divided, the, body, of, christ, choose, heresy, every, time, the, word, schism, comes, from, the, greek, word, which, means, cleft, division, in, buddhism, the, first, schism, was, set, up, by, devadatta, during, buddha, s, life, this, schism, lasted, only, a, short, time, later, after, buddha, s, death, the, early, buddhist, schools, came, into, being, but, were, not, schismatic, only, focusing, on, different, interpretations, for, the, same, monastic, community, in, the, old, texts, 18, or, 20, early, schools, are, mentioned, later, there, were, the, mahayana, and, vajrayana, movements, which, can, be, regarded, as, being, schismatic, in, origin, each, school, has, various, subgroups, which, often, are, schismatic, in, origin, for, example, in, thai, theravadin, buddhism, there, are, two, groups, mahanikaya, and, dhammayut, of, which, the, dhammayut, has, its, origin, partly, in, the, mahanikaya, and, is, the, new, and, schismatic, group, both, mahanikaya, and, dhammayut, have, many, subgroups, which, usually, do, not, have, schismatic, origins, but, came, into, being, in, a, natural, way, through, the, popularity, of, a, leader, monk, tibetan, buddhism, has, seen, schisms, in, the, past, of, which, most, were, healed, although, the, drukpa, school, centred, in, bhutan, perhaps, remains, in, a, state, of, schism, since, 1616, from, the, other, tibetan, schools, the, words, schism, and, schismatic, are, used, to, denote, splits, within, a, church, denomination, or, religious, body, in, this, context, schismatic, as, a, noun, denotes, a, person, who, creates, or, incites, schism, in, a, church, or, a, person, who, is, a, member, of, a, splinter, church, as, an, adjective, schismatic, refers, to, ideas, and, activities, that, are, thought, to, lead, to, or, constitute, schism, and, ultimately, to, departure, from, what, the, user, of, the, word, considers, to, be, the, true, christian, church, these, words, have, been, used, to, denote, both, the, phenomenon, of, christian, group, splintering, in, general, and, certain, significant, historical, splits, in, particular, one, can, make, a, distinction, between, heresy, and, schism, heresy, is, rejection, of, a, doctrine, that, a, church, considered, to, be, essential, schism, is, a, rejection, of, communion, with, the, authorities, of, a, church, and, not, every, break, of, communion, is, necessarily, about, doctrine, as, is, clear, from, examples, such, as, the, western, schism, and, the, breaking, of, the, communion, that, existed, between, patriarch, bartholomew, i, of, constantinople, and, archbishop, christodoulos, of, athens, in, 2004, however, when, for, any, reason, people, withdraw, from, communion, two, distinct, ecclesiastical, entities, may, result, each, of, which, or, at, least, some, members, thereof, may, then, accuse, the, other, s, of, heresy, in, roman, catholic, church, canon, law, an, act, of, schism, like, an, act, of, apostasy, or, heresy, automatically, brings, the, penalty, of, excommunication, on, the, individual, who, commits, it, as, stated, in, canon, 1312, 1, 1, of, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, this, penalty, is, intended, to, be, medicinal, so, as, to, lead, to, restoration, of, unity, roman, catholic, theology, considers, formal, schismatics, to, be, outside, the, church, understanding, by, formal, schismatics, persons, who, knowing, the, true, nature, of, the, church, have, personally, and, deliberately, committed, the, sin, of, schism, the, situation, for, instance, of, those, who, have, been, brought, up, from, childhood, within, a, group, not, in, full, communion, with, rome, but, who, have, orthodox, faith, is, different, these, are, considered, to, be, imperfectly, though, not, fully, related, to, the, church, this, nuanced, view, applies, especially, to, the, churches, of, eastern, christianity, more, particularly, still, to, the, eastern, orthodox, church, while, they, don, t, possess, full, communion, communio, in, sacris, with, the, catholic, church, they, are, still, considered, much, more, linked, to, it, than, the, protestant, ecclesial, communities, which, have, markedly, different, theological, beliefs, and, rejected, the, concept, of, apostolic, succession, with, the, exception, of, the, anglicans, which, however, are, viewed, by, the, catholic, church, as, not, having, a, valid, priesthood, the, first, council, of, nicaea, a, d, 325, distinguished, between, schism, and, heresy, it, declared, arian, and, non, trinitarian, teachings, to, be, heretical, and, excluded, their, adherents, from, the, church, it, also, addressed, the, schism, between, peter, of, alexandria, and, meletius, of, lycopolis, considering, their, quarrel, to, be, a, matter, of, discipline, not, of, faith, the, divisions, that, came, to, a, head, at, the, councils, of, ephesus, a, d, 431, and, chalcedon, a, d, 451, were, seen, as, matters, of, heresy, not, merely, of, schism, thus, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, oriental, orthodoxy, regard, each, other, as, heretical, not, orthodox, because, of, the, oriental, orthodox, church, s, rejection, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, s, acceptance, of, the, confession, of, chalcedon, about, the, two, natures, human, and, divine, of, christ, however, this, view, has, been, challenged, in, the, recent, ecumenical, discussion, between, these, two, groups, classifying, the, matter, of, chalcedon, as, a, matter, of, schism, not, of, heresy, in, its, extended, and, final, form, possibly, derived, from, the, first, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, although, only, known, from, the, acts, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, seventy, years, later, what, is, commonly, called, the, nicene, creed, declares, belief, in, the, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, some, who, accept, this, creed, believe, they, should, be, united, in, a, single, church, or, group, of, churches, in, communion, with, each, other, others, who, accept, this, creed, believe, it, does, not, speak, of, a, visible, organization, but, of, all, those, baptized, who, hold, the, christian, faith, referred, to, as, christendom, some, churches, consider, themselves, to, be, the, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, for, instance, the, roman, catholic, church, claims, that, title, and, considers, the, eastern, orthodox, church, to, be, in, schism, while, the, eastern, orthodox, church, also, claims, that, title, and, holds, the, view, that, the, catholic, church, is, schismatic, some, protestant, churches, believe, that, they, also, represent, the, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, and, consider, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, to, be, in, error, while, others, do, not, expect, a, union, of, all, christian, churches, on, earth, see, also, one, true, church, and, great, apostasy, protestant, groups, lacking, the, stronger, traditional, authority, structures, of, say, roman, catholicism, or, eastern, orthodoxy, and, often, riven, by, politico, national, divides, sometimes, resulting, from, cuius, regio, eius, religio, show, a, high, degree, of, fissibility, which, ecumenical, efforts, may, only, intensify, schisms, have, occurred, particularly, frequently, among, anabaptists, to, the, extent, that, divisions, over, even, minute, details, of, doctrine, and, theology, are, common, and, scholars, have, dubbed, the, phenomenon, t, uferkrankheit, or, the, anabaptist, disease, emphasizing, fully, voluntary, membership, in, the, church, and, without, an, established, authority, of, hierarchical, structure, anabaptists, especially, mennonites, have, experienced, dozens, of, schisms, resulting, in, the, establishment, of, dozens, of, various, unaffiliated, mennonite, churches, a, current, dispute, with, an, acknowledged, risk, of, schism, for, the, anglican, communion, involves, responses, to, homosexuality, in, 2018,

mainstream, smarta, denomination, it, became, a, schismatic, institution, when, tanjore, and, the, wodeyars, of, mysore, went, to, war, against, each, other, it, is, on, record, that, in, 1839, the, kumbakonam, mutt, applied, for, permission, to, the, english, collector, of, arcot, to, perform, the, kumbhabhishekham, of, the, kamakshi, temple, in, kanchipuram, in, 1842, the, east, india, company, headquartered, at, fort, william, calcutta, appointed, the, head, of, the, mutt, as, the, sole, trustee, of, the, kamakshi, temple, the, protests, of, the, traditional, priests, of, the, kamakshi, temple, are, well, documented, and, preserved, incidentally, fort, william, is, also, the, first, freemason, lodge, of, india, since, then, the, math, has, maintained, cordial, relations, with, the, british, raj, though, the, main, math, at, sringeri, fell, sour, with, the, colonial, power, thus, the, kanchi, mutt, can, at, best, claim, its, origin, to, be, in, 1842, after, the, death, of, the,
