a, fact, is, a, true, datum, about, one, or, more, aspects, of, a, circumstance, standard, reference, works, are, often, used, to, check, facts, scientific, facts, are, verified, by, repeatable, careful, observation, or, measurement, by, experiments, or, other, means, for, example, this, sentence, contains, words, accurately, describes, a, linguistic, fact, and, the, sun, is, a, star, accurately, describes, an, astronomical, fact, further, abraham, lincoln, was, the, 16th, president, of, the, united, states, and, abraham, lincoln, was, assassinated, both, accurately, describe, historical, facts, generally, speaking, facts, are, independent, of, belief, and, of, knowledge, and, opinion, facts, are, different, from, inferences, theories, values, and, objects, the, word, fact, derives, from, the, latin, factum, it, was, first, used, in, english, with, the, same, meaning, a, thing, done, or, performed, a, meaning, now, obsolete, the, common, usage, of, something, that, has, really, occurred, or, is, the, case, dates, from, the, mid, 16th, century, barbara, j, shapiro, wrote, in, her, book, a, culture, of, fact, how, the, concept, of, a, fact, evolved, starting, within, the, english, legal, tradition, of, the, 16th, century, in, 1870, charles, sanders, peirce, described, in, his, book, the, fixation, of, belief, four, methods, which, people, use, to, decide, what, they, should, believe, tenacity, method, of, authority, a, priori, and, scientific, method, the, term, fact, also, indicates, a, matter, under, discussion, deemed, to, be, true, or, correct, such, as, to, emphasize, a, point, or, prove, a, disputed, issue, e, g, the, fact, of, the, matter, is, alternatively, fact, may, also, indicate, an, allegation, or, stipulation, of, something, that, may, or, may, not, be, a, true, fact, e, g, the, author, s, facts, are, not, trustworthy, this, alternate, usage, although, contested, by, some, has, a, long, history, in, standard, english, according, to, the, american, heritage, dictionary, of, the, english, language, the, oxford, english, dictionary, dates, this, use, to, 1729, fact, may, also, indicate, findings, derived, through, a, process, of, evaluation, including, review, of, testimony, direct, observation, or, otherwise, as, distinguishable, from, matters, of, inference, or, speculation, this, use, is, reflected, in, the, terms, fact, find, and, fact, finder, e, g, set, up, a, fact, finding, commission, facts, may, be, checked, by, reason, experiment, personal, experience, or, may, be, argued, from, authority, roger, bacon, wrote, if, in, other, sciences, we, should, arrive, at, certainty, without, doubt, and, truth, without, error, it, behooves, us, to, place, the, foundations, of, knowledge, in, mathematics, in, philosophy, the, concept, fact, is, considered, in, the, branch, of, philosophy, concerned, with, knowledge, called, epistemology, and, ontology, which, studies, concepts, such, as, existence, being, becoming, and, reality, questions, of, objectivity, and, truth, are, closely, associated, with, questions, of, fact, a, fact, can, be, defined, as, something, that, is, the, case, in, other, words, a, state, of, affairs, facts, may, be, understood, as, information, which, makes, a, true, sentence, true, a, fact, is, traditionally, the, worldly, correlate, of, a, true, proposition, a, state, of, affairs, whose, obtaining, makes, that, proposition, true, facts, may, also, be, understood, as, those, things, to, which, a, true, sentence, refers, the, statement, jupiter, is, the, largest, planet, in, the, solar, system, is, about, the, fact, that, jupiter, is, the, largest, planet, in, the, solar, system, pascal, engel, s, version, of, the, correspondence, theory, of, truth, explains, that, what, makes, a, sentence, true, is, that, it, corresponds, to, a, fact, this, theory, presupposes, the, existence, of, an, objective, world, the, slingshot, argument, claims, to, show, that, all, true, statements, stand, for, the, same, thing, the, truth, value, true, if, this, argument, holds, and, facts, are, taken, to, be, what, true, statements, stand, for, then, one, arrives, at, the, counter, intuitive, conclusion, that, there, is, only, one, fact, the, truth, any, non, trivial, true, statement, about, reality, is, necessarily, an, abstraction, composed, of, a, complex, of, objects, and, properties, or, relations, facts, possess, internal, structure, being, complexes, of, objects, and, properties, or, relations, for, example, the, fact, described, by, the, true, statement, paris, is, the, capital, city, of, france, implies, that, there, is, such, a, place, as, paris, there, is, such, a, place, as, france, there, are, such, things, as, capital, cities, as, well, as, that, france, has, a, government, that, the, government, of, france, has, the, power, to, define, its, capital, city, and, that, the, french, government, has, chosen, paris, to, be, the, capital, that, there, is, such, a, thing, as, a, place, or, a, government, and, so, on, the, verifiable, accuracy, of, all, of, these, assertions, if, facts, themselves, may, coincide, to, create, the, fact, that, paris, is, the, capital, of, france, difficulties, arise, however, in, attempting, to, identify, the, constituent, parts, of, negative, modal, disjunctive, or, moral, facts, moral, philosophers, since, david, hume, have, debated, whether, values, are, objective, and, thus, factual, in, a, treatise, of, human, nature, hume, pointed, out, there, is, no, obvious, way, for, a, series, of, statements, about, what, ought, to, be, the, case, to, be, derived, from, a, series, of, statements, of, what, is, the, case, this, is, called, the, is, ought, distinction, those, who, insist, there, is, a, logical, gulf, between, facts, and, values, such, that, it, is, fallacious, to, attempt, to, derive, values, e, g, it, is, good, to, give, food, to, hungry, people, from, facts, e, g, people, will, die, if, they, can, t, eat, include, g, e, moore, who, called, attempting, to, do, so, the, naturalistic, fallacy, factuality, what, has, occurred, can, also, be, contrasted, with, counterfactuality, what, might, have, occurred, but, did, not, a, counterfactual, conditional, or, subjunctive, conditional, is, a, conditional, or, if, then, statement, indicating, what, would, be, the, case, if, events, had, been, other, than, they, were, for, example, if, alexander, had, lived, his, empire, would, have, been, greater, than, rome, this, contrasts, with, an, indicative, conditional, which, indicates, what, is, in, fact, the, case, if, its, antecedent, is, in, fact, true, for, example, if, you, drink, this, it, will, make, you, well, such, sentences, are, important, to, modal, logic, especially, since, the, development, of, possible, world, semantics, in, mathematics, a, fact, is, a, statement, called, a, theorem, that, can, be, proven, by, logical, argument, from, certain, axioms, and, definitions, the, definition, of, a, scientific, fact, is, different, from, the, definition, of, fact, as, it, implies, knowledge, a, scientific, fact, is, the, result, of, a, repeatable, careful, observation, or, measurement, by, experimentation, or, other, means, also, called, empirical, evidence, these, are, central, to, building, scientific, theories, various, forms, of, observation, and, measurement, lead, to, fundamental, questions, about, the, scientific, method, and, the, scope, and, validity, of, scientific, reasoning, in, the, most, basic, sense, a, scientific, fact, is, an, objective, and, verifiable, observation, in, contrast, with, a, hypothesis, or, theory, which, is, intended, to, explain, or, interpret, facts, various, scholars, have, offered, significant, refinements, to, this, basic, formulation, philosophers, and, scientists, are, careful, to, distinguish, between, 1, states, of, affairs, in, the, external, world, and, 2, assertions, of, fact, that, may, be, considered, relevant, in, scientific, analysis, the, term, is, used, in, both, senses, in, the, philosophy, of, science, scholars, and, clinical, researchers, in, both, the, social, and, natural, sciences, have, written, about, numerous, questions, and, theories, that, arise, in, the, attempt, to, clarify, the, fundamental, nature, of, scientific, fact, pertinent, issues, raised, by, this, inquiry, include, consistent, with, the, idea, of, confirmation, holism, some, scholars, assert, fact, to, be, necessarily, theory, laden, to, some, degree, thomas, kuhn, points, out, that, knowing, what, facts, to, measure, and, how, to, measure, them, requires, the, use, of, other, theories, for, example, the, age, of, fossils, is, based, on, radiometric, dating, which, is, justified, by, reasoning, that, radioactive, decay, follows, a, poisson, process, rather, than, a, bernoulli, process, similarly, percy, williams, bridgman, is, credited, with, the, methodological, position, known, as, operationalism, which, asserts, that, all, observations, are, not, only, influenced, but, necessarily, defined, by, the, means, and, assumptions, used, to, measure, them, apart, from, the, fundamental, inquiry, into, the, nature, of, scientific, fact, there, remain, the, practical, and, social, considerations, of, how, fact, is, investigated, established, and, substantiated, through, the, proper, application, of, the, scientific, method, 181, ff, scientific, facts, are, generally, believed, independent, of, the, observer, no, matter, who, performs, a, scientific, experiment, all, observers, agree, on, the, outcome, in, addition, to, these, considerations, there, are, the, social, and, institutional, measures, such, as, peer, review, and, accreditation, that, are, intended, to, promote, factual, accuracy, among, other, interests, in, scientific, study, a, common, rhetorical, clich, states, history, is, written, by, the, winners, this, phrase, suggests, but, does, not, examine, the, use, of, facts, in, the, writing, of, history, e, h, carr, in, his, 1961, volume, what, is, history, argues, that, the, inherent, biases, from, the, gathering, of, facts, makes, the, objective, truth, of, any, historical, perspective, idealistic, and, impossible, facts, are, like, fish, in, the, ocean, of, which, we, may, only, happen, to, catch, a, few, only, an, indication, of, what, is, below, the, surface, even, a, dragnet, cannot, tell, us, for, certain, what, it, would, be, like, to, live, below, the, ocean, s, surface, even, if, we, do, not, discard, any, facts, or, fish, presented, we, will, always, miss, the, majority, the, site, of, our, fishing, the, methods, undertaken, the, weather, and, even, luck, play, a, vital, role, in, what, we, will, catch, additionally, the, composition, of, history, is, inevitably, made, up, by, the, compilation, of, many, different, biases, of, fact, finding, all, compounded, over, time, he, concludes, that, for, a, historian, to, attempt, a, more, objective, method, one, must, accept, that, history, can, only, aspire, to, a, conversation, of, the, present, with, the, past, and, that, one, s, methods, of, fact, gathering, should, be, openly, examined, the, set, of, highlighted, historical, facts, and, their, interpretations, therefore, changes, over, time, and, reflect, present, consensuses, this, section, of, the, article, emphasizes, common, law, jurisprudence, as, primarily, represented, in, anglo, american, based, legal, tradition, nevertheless, the, principles, described, herein, have, analogous, treatment, in, other, legal, systems, such, as, civil, law, systems, as, well, in, most, common, law, jurisdictions, the, general, concept, and, analysis, of, fact, reflects, fundamental, principles, of, jurisprudence, and, is, supported, by, several, well, established, standards, matters, of, fact, have, various, formal, definitions, under, common, law, jurisdictions, these, include, a, party, e, g, plaintiff, to, a, civil, suit, generally, must, clearly, state, the, relevant, allegations, of, fact, that, form, the, basis, of, a, claim, the, requisite, level, of, precision, and, particularity, of, these, allegations, varies, depending, on, the, rules, of, civil, procedure, and, jurisdiction, parties, who, face, uncertainties, regarding, facts, and, circumstances, attendant, to, their, side, in, a, dispute, may, sometimes, invoke, alternative, pleading, in, this, situation, a, party, may, plead, separate, sets, of, facts, that, when, considered, together, may, be, contradictory, or, mutually, exclusive, this, seemingly, logically, inconsistent, presentation, of, facts, may, be, necessary, as, a, safeguard, against, contingencies, such, as, res, judicata, that, would, otherwise, preclude, presenting, a, claim, or, defense, that, depends, on, a, particular, interpretation, of, the, underlying, facts, and, ruling, of, the, court
