a, conscience, is, a, cognitive, process, that, elicits, emotion, and, rational, associations, based, on, an, individual, s, moral, philosophy, or, value, system, conscience, stands, in, contrast, to, elicited, emotion, or, thought, due, to, associations, based, on, immediate, sensory, perceptions, and, reflexive, responses, as, in, sympathetic, central, nervous, system, responses, in, common, terms, conscience, is, often, described, as, leading, to, feelings, of, remorse, when, a, person, commits, an, act, that, conflicts, with, their, moral, values, the, extent, to, which, conscience, informs, moral, judgment, before, an, action, and, whether, such, moral, judgments, are, or, should, be, based, on, reason, has, occasioned, debate, through, much, of, modern, history, between, theories, of, basics, in, ethic, of, human, life, in, juxtaposition, to, the, theories, of, romanticism, and, other, reactionary, movements, after, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, religious, views, of, conscience, usually, see, it, as, linked, to, a, morality, inherent, in, all, humans, to, a, beneficent, universe, and, or, to, divinity, the, diverse, ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional, and, material, features, of, religion, may, not, necessarily, cohere, with, experiential, emotive, spiritual, or, contemplative, considerations, about, the, origin, and, operation, of, conscience, common, secular, or, scientific, views, regard, the, capacity, for, conscience, as, probably, genetically, determined, with, its, subject, probably, learned, or, imprinted, as, part, of, a, culture, commonly, used, metaphors, for, conscience, include, the, voice, within, the, inner, light, or, even, socrates, reliance, on, what, the, greeks, called, his, daim, nic, sign, an, averting, apotreptikos, inner, voice, heard, only, when, he, was, about, to, make, a, mistake, conscience, as, is, detailed, in, sections, below, is, a, concept, in, national, and, international, law, is, increasingly, conceived, of, as, applying, to, the, world, as, a, whole, has, motivated, numerous, notable, acts, for, the, public, good, and, been, the, subject, of, many, prominent, examples, of, literature, music, and, film, although, humanity, has, no, generally, accepted, definition, of, conscience, or, universal, agreement, about, its, role, in, ethical, decision, making, three, approaches, have, addressed, it, in, the, literary, traditions, of, the, upanishads, brahma, sutras, and, the, bhagavad, gita, conscience, is, the, label, given, to, attributes, composing, knowledge, about, good, and, evil, that, a, soul, acquires, from, the, completion, of, acts, and, consequent, accretion, of, karma, over, many, lifetimes, according, to, adi, shankara, in, his, vivekachudamani, morally, right, action, characterised, as, humbly, and, compassionately, performing, the, primary, duty, of, good, to, others, without, expectation, of, material, or, spiritual, reward, helps, purify, the, heart, and, provide, mental, tranquility, but, it, alone, does, not, give, us, direct, perception, of, the, reality, this, knowledge, requires, discrimination, between, the, eternal, and, non, eternal, and, eventually, a, realization, in, contemplation, that, the, true, self, merges, in, a, universe, of, pure, consciousness, in, the, zoroastrian, faith, after, death, a, soul, must, face, judgment, at, the, bridge, of, the, separator, there, evil, people, are, tormented, by, prior, denial, of, their, own, higher, nature, or, conscience, and, to, all, time, will, they, be, guests, for, the, house, of, the, lie, the, chinese, concept, of, ren, indicates, that, conscience, along, with, social, etiquette, and, correct, relationships, assist, humans, to, follow, the, way, tao, a, mode, of, life, reflecting, the, implicit, human, capacity, for, goodness, and, harmony, conscience, also, features, prominently, in, buddhism, in, the, pali, scriptures, for, example, buddha, links, the, positive, aspect, of, conscience, to, a, pure, heart, and, a, calm, well, directed, mind, it, is, regarded, as, a, spiritual, power, and, one, of, the, guardians, of, the, world, the, buddha, also, associated, conscience, with, compassion, for, those, who, must, endure, cravings, and, suffering, in, the, world, until, right, conduct, culminates, in, right, mindfulness, and, right, contemplation, santideva, 685, 763, ce, wrote, in, the, bodhicaryavatara, which, he, composed, and, delivered, in, the, great, northern, indian, buddhist, university, of, nalanda, of, the, spiritual, importance, of, perfecting, virtues, such, as, generosity, forbearance, and, training, the, awareness, to, be, like, a, block, of, wood, when, attracted, by, vices, such, as, pride, or, lust, so, one, can, continue, advancing, towards, right, understanding, in, meditative, absorption, conscience, thus, manifests, in, buddhism, as, unselfish, love, for, all, living, beings, which, gradually, intensifies, and, awakens, to, a, purer, awareness, where, the, mind, withdraws, from, sensory, interests, and, becomes, aware, of, itself, as, a, single, whole, the, roman, emperor, marcus, aurelius, wrote, in, his, meditations, that, conscience, was, the, human, capacity, to, live, by, rational, principles, that, were, congruent, with, the, true, tranquil, and, harmonious, nature, of, our, mind, and, thereby, that, of, the, universe, to, move, from, one, unselfish, action, to, another, with, god, in, mind, only, there, delight, and, stillness, the, only, rewards, of, our, existence, here, are, an, unstained, character, and, unselfish, acts, the, islamic, concept, of, taqwa, is, closely, related, to, conscience, in, the, qur, n, verses, 2, 197, 22, 37, taqwa, refers, to, right, conduct, or, piety, guarding, of, oneself, or, guarding, against, evil, qur, n, verse, 47, 17, says, that, god, is, the, ultimate, source, of, the, believer, s, taqw, which, is, not, simply, the, product, of, individual, will, but, requires, inspiration, from, god, in, qur, n, verses, 91, 7, 8, god, the, almighty, talks, about, how, he, has, perfected, the, soul, the, conscience, and, has, taught, it, the, wrong, fuj, r, and, right, taqw, hence, the, awareness, of, vice, and, virtue, is, inherent, in, the, soul, allowing, it, to, be, tested, fairly, in, the, life, of, this, world, and, tried, held, accountable, on, the, day, of, judgment, for, responsibilities, to, god, and, all, humans, qur, n, verse, 49, 13, states, o, humankind, we, have, created, you, out, of, male, and, female, and, constituted, you, into, different, groups, and, societies, so, that, you, may, come, to, know, each, other, the, noblest, of, you, in, the, sight, of, god, are, the, ones, possessing, taqw, in, islam, according, to, eminent, theologians, such, as, al, ghazali, although, events, are, ordained, and, written, by, god, in, al, lawh, al, mahf, z, the, preserved, tablet, humans, possess, free, will, to, choose, between, wrong, and, right, and, are, thus, responsible, for, their, actions, the, conscience, being, a, dynamic, personal, connection, to, god, enhanced, by, knowledge, and, practise, of, the, five, pillars, of, islam, deeds, of, piety, repentance, self, discipline, and, prayer, and, disintegrated, and, metaphorically, covered, in, blackness, through, sinful, acts, marshall, hodgson, wrote, the, three, volume, work, the, venture, of, islam, conscience, and, history, in, a, world, civilization, in, the, protestant, christian, tradition, martin, luther, insisted, in, the, diet, of, worms, that, his, conscience, was, captive, to, the, word, of, god, and, it, was, neither, safe, nor, right, to, go, against, conscience, to, luther, conscience, falls, within, the, ethical, rather, than, the, religious, sphere, john, calvin, saw, conscience, as, a, battleground, the, enemies, who, rise, up, in, our, conscience, against, his, kingdom, and, hinder, his, decrees, prove, that, god, s, throne, is, not, firmly, established, therein, many, christians, regard, following, one, s, conscience, as, important, as, or, even, more, important, than, obeying, human, authority, according, to, the, bible, written, in, romans, 2, 15, conscience, is, the, one, bearing, witness, accusing, or, excusing, one, another, so, we, would, know, when, we, break, the, law, written, in, our, hearts, the, guilt, we, feel, when, we, do, something, wrong, tells, us, that, we, need, to, repent, this, can, sometimes, as, with, the, conflict, between, william, tyndale, and, thomas, more, over, the, translation, of, the, bible, into, english, lead, to, moral, quandaries, do, i, unreservedly, obey, my, church, priest, military, political, leader, or, do, i, follow, my, own, inner, feeling, of, right, and, wrong, as, instructed, by, prayer, and, a, personal, reading, of, scripture, some, contemporary, christian, churches, and, religious, groups, hold, the, moral, teachings, of, the, ten, commandments, or, of, jesus, as, the, highest, authority, in, any, situation, regardless, of, the, extent, to, which, it, involves, responsibilities, in, law, in, the, gospel, of, john, 7, 53, 8, 11, king, james, version, jesus, challenges, those, accusing, a, woman, of, adultery, stating, he, that, is, without, sin, among, you, let, him, first, cast, a, stone, at, her, and, again, he, stooped, down, and, wrote, on, the, ground, and, they, which, heard, it, being, convicted, by, their, own, conscience, went, out, one, by, one, see, jesus, and, the, woman, taken, in, adultery, in, the, gospel, of, luke, 10, 25, 37, jesus, tells, the, story, of, how, a, despised, and, heretical, samaritan, see, parable, of, the, good, samaritan, who, out, of, compassion, pity, the, word, conscience, is, not, used, helps, an, injured, stranger, beside, a, road, qualifies, better, for, eternal, life, by, loving, his, neighbor, than, a, priest, who, passes, by, on, the, other, side, this, dilemma, of, obedience, in, conscience, to, divine, or, state, law, was, demonstrated, dramatically, in, antigone, s, defiance, of, king, creon, s, order, against, burying, her, brother, an, alleged, traitor, appealing, to, the, unwritten, law, and, to, a, longer, allegiance, to, the, dead, than, to, the, living, catholic, theology, sees, conscience, as, the, last, practical, judgment, of, reason, which, at, the, appropriate, moment, enjoins, to, do, good, and, to, avoid, evil, the, second, vatican, council, 1962, 65, describes, deep, within, his, conscience, man, discovers, a, law, which, he, has, not, laid, upon, himself, but, which, he, must, obey, its, voice, ever, calling, him, to, love, and, to, do, what, is, good, and, to, avoid, evil, tells, him, inwardly, at, the, right, movement, do, this, shun, that, for, man, has, in, his, heart, a, law, inscribed, by, god, his, dignity, lies, in, observing, this, law, and, by, it, he, will, be, judged, his, conscience, is, man, s, most, secret, core, and, his, sanctuary, there, he, is, alone, with, god, whose, voice, echoes, in, his, depths, thus, conscience, is, not, like, the, will, nor, a, habit, like, prudence, but, the, interior, space, in, which, we, can, listen, to, and, hear, the, truth, the, good, the, voice, of, god, it, is, the, inner, place, of, our, relationship, with, him, who, speaks, to, our, heart, and, helps, us, to, discern, to, understand, the, path, we, ought, to, take, and, once, the, decision, is, made, to, move, forward, to, remain, faithful, in, terms, of, logic, conscience, can, be, viewed, as, the, practical, conclusion, of, a, moral, syllogism, whose, major, premise, is, an, objective, norm, and, whose, minor, premise, is, a, particular, case, or, situation, to, which, the, norm, is, applied, thus, catholics, are, taught, to, carefully, educate, themselves, as, to, revealed, norms, and, norms, derived, therefrom, so, as, to, form, a, correct, conscience, catholics, are, also, to, examine, their, conscience, daily, and, with, special, care, before, confession, catholic, teaching, holds, that, man, has, the, right, to, act, according, to, his, conscience, and, in, freedom, so, as, personally, to, make, moral, decisions, he, must, not, be, forced, to, act, contrary, to, his, conscience, nor, must, he, be, prevented, from, acting, according, to, his, conscience, especially, in, religious, matters, this, right, of, conscience, does, not, allow, one, to, arbitrarily, disagree, with, church, teaching, and, claim, that, one, is, acting, in, accordance, with, conscience, a, sincere, conscience, presumes, one, is, diligently, seeking, moral, truth, from, authentic, sources, that, is, seeking, to, conform, oneself, to, that, moral, truth, by, listening, to, the, authority, established, by, christ, to, teach, it, nevertheless, despite, one, s, best, effort, t, can, happen, that, moral, conscience, remains, in, ignorance, and, makes, erroneous, judgments, about, acts, to, be, performed, or, already, committed, this, ignorance, can, often, be, imputed, to, personal, responsibility, in, such, cases, the, person, is, culpable, for, the, wrong, he, commits, thus, if, one, realizes, one, may, have, made, a, mistaken, judgment, one, s, conscience, is, said, to, be, vincibly, erroneous, and, it, is, not, a, valid, norm, for, action, one, must, first, remove, the, source, of, error, and, do, one, s, best, to, achieve, a, correct, judgment, if, however, one, is, not, aware, of, one, s, error, or, if, despite, an, honest, and, diligent, effort, one, cannot, remove, the, error, by, study, or, seeking, advice, then, one, s, conscience, may, be, said, to, be, invincibly, erroneous, it, binds, since, one, has, subjective, certainty, that, one, is, correct, the, act, resulting, from, acting, on, the, invincibly, erroneous, conscience, is, not, good, in, itself, yet, this, deformed, act, or, material, sin, against, god, s, right, order, and, the, objective, norm, is, not, imputed, to, the, person, the, formal, obedience, given, to, such, a, judgment, of, conscience, is, good, some, catholics, appeal, to, conscience, in, order, to, justify, dissent, not, on, the, level, of, conscience, properly, understood, but, on, the, level, of, the, principles, and, norms, which, are, supposed, to, inform, conscience, for, example, some, priests, make, on, the, use, of, the, so, called, internal, forum, solution, which, is, not, sanctioned, by, the, magisterium, to, justify, actions, or, lifestyles, incompatible, with, church, teaching, such, as, christ, s, prohibition, of, remarriage, after, divorce, or, sexual, activity, outside, marriage, the, catholic, church, has, warned, that, rejection, of, the, church, s, authority, and, her, teaching, can, be, at, the, source, of, errors, in, judgment, in, moral, conduct, an, example, of, someone, following, his, conscience, to, the, point, of, accepting, the, consequence, of, being, condemned, to, death, is, sir, thomas, more, 1478, 1535, a, theologian, who, wrote, on, the, distinction, between, the, sense, of, duty, and, the, moral, sense, as, two, aspects, of, conscience, and, who, saw, the, former, as, some, feeling, that, can, only, be, explained, by, a, divine, lawgiver, was, john, henry, cardinal, newman, a, well, known, saying, of, him, is, that, he, would, first, toast, on, his, conscience, and, only, then, on, the, pope, since, his, conscience, brought, him, to, acknowledge, the, authority, of, the, pope, judaism, arguably, does, not, require, uncompromising, obedience, to, religious, authority, the, case, has, been, made, that, throughout, jewish, history, rabbis, have, circumvented, laws, they, found, unconscionable, such, as, capital, punishment, similarly, although, an, occupation, with, national, destiny, has, been, central, to, the, jewish, faith, see, zionism, many, scholars, including, moses, mendelssohn, stated, that, conscience, as, a, personal, revelation, of, scriptural, truth, was, an, important, adjunct, to, the, talmudic, tradition, the, concept, of, inner, light, in, the, religious, society, of, friends, or, quakers, is, associated, with, conscience, freemasonry, describes, itself, as, providing, an, adjunct, to, religion, and, key, symbols, found, in, a, freemason, lodge, are, the, square, and, compasses, explained, as, providing, lessons, that, masons, should, square, their, actions, by, the, square, of, conscience, learn, to, circumscribe, their, desires, and, keep, their, passions, within, due, bounds, toward, all, mankind, the, historian, manning, clark, viewed, conscience, as, one, of, the, comforters, that, religion, placed, between, man, and, death, but, also, a, crucial, part, of, the, quest, for, grace, encouraged, by, the, book, of, job, and, the, book, of, ecclesiastes, leading, us, to, be, paradoxically, closest, to, the, truth, when, we, suspect, that, what, matters, most, in, life, being, there, when, everyone, suddenly, understands, what, it, has, all, been, for, can, never, happen, leo, tolstoy, after, a, decade, studying, the, issue, 1877, 1887, held, that, the, only, power, capable, of, resisting, the, evil, associated, with, materialism, and, the, drive, for, social, power, of, religious, institutions, was, the, capacity, of, humans, to, reach, an, individual, spiritual, truth, through, reason, and, conscience, many, prominent, religious, works, about, conscience, also, have, a, significant, philosophical, component, examples, are, the, works, of, al, ghazali, avicenna, aquinas, joseph, butler, and, dietrich, bonhoeffer, all, discussed, in, the, philosophical, views, section, the, secular, approach, to, conscience, includes, psychological, physiological, sociological, humanitarian, and, authoritarian, views, lawrence, kohlberg, considered, critical, conscience, to, be, an, important, psychological, stage, in, the, proper, moral, development, of, humans, associated, with, the, capacity, to, rationally, weigh, principles, of, responsibility, being, best, encouraged, in, the, very, young, by, linkage, with, humorous, personifications, such, as, jiminy, cricket, and, later, in, adolescents, by, debates, about, individually, pertinent, moral, dilemmas, erik, erikson, placed, the, development, of, conscience, in, the, pre, schooler, phase, of, his, eight, stages, of, normal, human, personality, development, the, psychologist, martha, stout, terms, conscience, an, intervening, sense, of, obligation, based, in, our, emotional, attachments, thus, a, good, conscience, is, associated, with, feelings, of, integrity, psychological, wholeness, and, peacefulness, and, is, often, described, using, adjectives, such, as, quiet, clear, and, easy, sigmund, freud, regarded, conscience, as, originating, psychologically, from, the, growth, of, civilisation, which, periodically, frustrated, the, external, expression, of, aggression, this, destructive, impulse, being, forced, to, seek, an, alternative, healthy, outlet, directed, its, energy, as, a, superego, against, the, person, s, own, ego, or, selfishness, often, taking, its, cue, in, this, regard, from, parents, during, childhood, according, to, freud, the, consequence, of, not, obeying, our, conscience, is, guilt, which, can, be, a, factor, in, the, development, of, neurosis, freud, claimed, that, both, the, cultural, and, individual, super, ego, set, up, strict, ideal, demands, with, regard, to, the, moral, aspects, of, certain, decisions, disobedience, to, which, provokes, a, fear, of, conscience, antonio, damasio, considers, conscience, an, aspect, of, extended, consciousness, beyond, survival, related, dispositions, and, incorporating, the, search, for, truth, and, desire, to, build, norms, and, ideals, for, behavior, michel, glautier, argues, that, conscience, is, one, of, the, instincts, and, drives, which, enable, people, to, form, societies, groups, of, humans, without, these, drives, or, in, whom, they, are, insufficient, cannot, form, societies, and, do, not, reproduce, their, kind, as, successfully, as, those, that, do, charles, darwin, considered, that, conscience, evolved, in, humans, to, resolve, conflicts, between, competing, natural, impulses, some, about, self, preservation, but, others, about, safety, of, a, family, or, community, the, claim, of, conscience, to, moral, authority, emerged, from, the, greater, duration, of, impression, of, social, instincts, in, the, struggle, for, survival, in, such, a, view, behavior, destructive, to, a, person, s, society, either, to, its, structures, or, to, the, persons, it, comprises, is, bad, or, evil, thus, conscience, can, be, viewed, as, an, outcome, of, those, biological, drives, that, prompt, humans, to, avoid, provoking, fear, or, contempt, in, others, being, experienced, as, guilt, and, shame, in, differing, ways, from, society, to, society, and, person, to, person, a, requirement, of, conscience, in, this, view, is, the, capacity, to, see, ourselves, from, the, point, of, view, of, another, person, persons, unable, to, do, this, psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists, therefore, often, act, in, ways, which, are, evil, fundamental, in, this, view, of, conscience, is, that, humans, consider, some, other, as, being, in, a, social, relationship, thus, nationalism, is, invoked, in, conscience, to, quell, tribal, conflict, and, the, notion, of, a, brotherhood, of, man, is, invoked, to, quell, national, conflicts, yet, such, crowd, drives, may, not, only, overwhelm, but, redefine, individual, conscience, friedrich, nietzsche, stated, communal, solidarity, is, annihilated, by, the, highest, and, strongest, drives, that, when, they, break, out, passionately, whip, the, individual, far, past, the, average, low, level, of, the, herd, conscience, jeremy, bentham, noted, that, fanaticism, never, sleeps, it, is, never, stopped, by, conscience, for, it, has, pressed, conscience, into, its, service, hannah, arendt, in, her, study, of, the, trial, of, adolf, eichmann, in, jerusalem, notes, that, the, accused, as, with, almost, all, his, fellow, germans, had, lost, track, of, his, conscience, to, the, point, where, they, hardly, remembered, it, this, wasn, t, caused, by, familiarity, with, atrocities, or, by, psychologically, redirecting, any, resultant, natural, pity, to, themselves, for, having, to, bear, such, an, unpleasant, duty, so, much, as, by, the, fact, that, anyone, whose, conscience, did, develop, doubts, could, see, no, one, who, shared, them, eichmann, did, not, need, to, close, his, ears, to, the, voice, of, conscience, not, because, he, had, none, but, because, his, conscience, spoke, with, a, respectable, voice, with, the, voice, of, the, respectable, society, around, him, sir, arthur, keith, in, 1948, developed, the, amity, enmity, complex, we, evolved, as, tribal, groups, surrounded, by, enemies, thus, conscience, evolved, a, dual, role, the, duty, to, save, and, protect, members, of, the, in, group, and, the, duty, to, show, hatred, and, aggression, towards, any, out, group, an, interesting, area, of, research, in, this, context, concerns, the, similarities, between, our, relationships, and, those, of, animals, whether, animals, in, human, society, pets, working, animals, even, animals, grown, for, food, or, in, the, wild, one, idea, is, that, as, people, or, animals, perceive, a, social, relationship, as, important, to, preserve, their, conscience, begins, to, respect, that, former, other, and, urge, actions, that, protect, it, similarly, in, complex, territorial, and, cooperative, breeding, bird, communities, such, as, the, australian, magpie, that, have, a, high, degree, of, etiquettes, rules, hierarchies, play, songs, and, negotiations, rule, breaking, seems, tolerated, on, occasions, not, obviously, related, to, survival, of, the, individual, or, group, behaviour, often, appearing, to, exhibit, a, touching, gentleness, and, tenderness, contemporary, scientists, in, evolutionary, biology, seek, to, explain, conscience, as, a, function, of, the, brain, that, evolved, to, facilitate, altruism, within, societies, in, his, book, the, god, delusion, richard, dawkins, states, that, he, agrees, with, robert, hinde, s, why, good, is, good, michael, shermer, s, the, science, of, good, and, evil, robert, buckman, s, can, we, be, good, without, god, and, marc, hauser, s, moral, minds, that, our, sense, of, right, and, wrong, can, be, derived, from, our, darwinian, past, he, subsequently, reinforced, this, idea, through, the, lens, of, the, gene, centered, view, of, evolution, since, the, unit, of, natural, selection, is, neither, an, individual, organism, nor, a, group, but, rather, the, selfish, gene, and, these, genes, could, ensure, their, own, selfish, survival, by, inter, alia, pushing, individuals, to, act, altruistically, towards, its, kin, numerous, case, studies, of, brain, damage, have, shown, that, damage, to, areas, of, the, brain, such, as, the, anterior, prefrontal, cortex, results, in, the, reduction, or, elimination, of, inhibitions, with, a, corresponding, radical, change, in, behaviour, when, the, damage, occurs, to, adults, they, may, still, be, able, to, perform, moral, reasoning, but, when, it, occurs, to, children, they, may, never, develop, that, ability, attempts, have, been, made, by, neuroscientists, to, locate, the, free, will, necessary, for, what, is, termed, the, veto, of, conscience, over, unconscious, mental, processes, see, neuroscience, of, free, will, and, benjamin, libet, in, a, scientifically, measurable, awareness, of, an, intention, to, carry, out, an, act, occurring, 350, 400, microseconds, after, the, electrical, discharge, known, as, the, readiness, potential, jacques, pitrat, claims, that, some, kind, of, artificial, conscience, is, beneficial, in, artificial, intelligence, systems, to, improve, their, long, term, performance, and, direct, their, introspective, processing, the, word, conscience, derives, etymologically, from, the, latin, conscientia, meaning, privity, of, knowledge, or, with, knowledge, the, english, word, implies, internal, awareness, of, a, moral, standard, in, the, mind, concerning, the, quality, of, one, s, motives, as, well, as, a, consciousness, of, our, own, actions, thus, conscience, considered, philosophically, may, be, first, and, perhaps, most, commonly, a, largely, unexamined, gut, feeling, or, vague, sense, of, guilt, about, what, ought, to, be, or, should, have, been, done, conscience, in, this, sense, is, not, necessarily, the, product, of, a, process, of, rational, consideration, of, the, moral, features, of, a, situation, or, the, applicable, normative, principles, rules, or, laws, and, can, arise, from, parental, peer, group, religious, state, or, corporate, indoctrination, which, may, or, may, not, be, presently, consciously, acceptable, to, the, person, traditional, conscience, conscience, may, be, defined, as, the, practical, reason, employed, when, applying, moral, convictions, to, a, situation, critical, conscience, in, purportedly, morally, mature, mystical, people, who, have, developed, this, capacity, through, daily, contemplation, or, meditation, combined, with, selfless, service, to, others, critical, conscience, can, be, aided, by, a, spark, of, intuitive, insight, or, revelation, called, marifa, in, islamic, sufi, philosophy, and, synderesis, in, medieval, christian, scholastic, moral, philosophy, conscience, is, accompanied, in, each, case, by, an, internal, awareness, of, inner, light, and, approbation, or, inner, darkness, and, condemnation, as, well, as, a, resulting, conviction, of, right, or, duty, either, followed, or, declined, the, medieval, islamic, scholar, and, mystic, al, ghazali, divided, the, concept, of, nafs, soul, or, self, spirituality, into, three, categories, based, on, the, qur, an, the, medieval, persian, philosopher, and, physician, muhammad, ibn, zakariya, al, razi, believed, in, a, close, relationship, between, conscience, or, spiritual, integrity, and, physical, health, rather, than, being, self, indulgent, man, should, pursue, knowledge, use, his, intellect, and, apply, justice, in, his, life, the, medieval, islamic, philosopher, avicenna, whilst, imprisoned, in, the, castle, of, fardajan, near, hamadhan, wrote, his, famous, isolated, but, awake, floating, man, sensory, deprivation, thought, experiment, to, explore, the, ideas, of, human, self, awareness, and, the, substantiality, of, the, soul, his, hypothesis, being, that, it, is, through, intelligence, particularly, the, active, intellect, that, god, communicates, truth, to, the, human, mind, or, conscience, according, to, the, islamic, sufis, conscience, allows, allah, to, guide, people, to, the, marifa, the, peace, or, light, upon, light, experienced, where, a, muslim, s, prayers, lead, to, a, melting, away, of, the, self, in, the, inner, knowledge, of, god, this, foreshadowing, the, eternal, paradise, depicted, in, the, qur, n, some, medieval, christian, scholastics, such, as, bonaventure, made, a, distinction, between, conscience, as, a, rational, faculty, of, the, mind, practical, reason, and, inner, awareness, an, intuitive, spark, to, do, good, called, synderesis, arising, from, a, remnant, appreciation, of, absolute, good, and, when, consciously, denied, for, example, to, perform, an, evil, act, becoming, a, source, of, inner, torment, early, modern, theologians, such, as, william, perkins, and, william, ames, developed, a, syllogistic, understanding, of, the, conscience, where, god, s, law, made, the, first, term, the, act, to, be, judged, the, second, and, the, action, of, the, conscience, as, a, rational, faculty, produced, the, judgement, by, debating, test, cases, applying, such, understanding, conscience, was, trained, and, refined, i, e, casuistry, in, the, 13th, century, st, thomas, aquinas, regarded, conscience, as, the, application, of, moral, knowledge, to, a, particular, case, s, t, i, q, 79, a, 13, thus, conscience, was, considered, an, act, or, judgment, of, practical, reason, that, began, with, synderesis, the, structured, development, of, our, innate, remnant, awareness, of, absolute, good, which, he, categorised, as, involving, the, five, primary, precepts, proposed, in, his, theory, of, natural, law, into, an, acquired, habit, of, applying, moral, principles, according, to, singer, aquinas, held, that, conscience, or, conscientia, was, an, imperfect, process, of, judgment, applied, to, activity, because, knowledge, of, the, natural, law, and, all, acts, of, natural, virtue, implicit, therein, was, obscured, in, most, people, by, education, and, custom, that, promoted, selfishness, rather, than, fellow, feeling, summa, theologiae, i, ii, i, aquinas, also, discussed, conscience, in, relation, to, the, virtue, of, prudence, to, explain, why, some, people, appear, to, be, less, morally, enlightened, than, others, their, weak, will, being, incapable, of, adequately, balancing, their, own, needs, with, those, of, others, aquinas, reasoned, that, acting, contrary, to, conscience, is, an, evil, action, but, an, errant, conscience, is, only, blameworthy, if, it, is, the, result, of, culpable, or, vincible, ignorance, of, factors, that, one, has, a, duty, to, have, knowledge, of, aquinas, also, argued, that, conscience, should, be, educated, to, act, towards, real, goods, from, god, which, encouraged, human, flourishing, rather, than, the, apparent, goods, of, sensory, pleasures, in, his, commentary, on, aristotle, s, nicomachean, ethics, aquinas, claimed, it, was, weak, will, that, allowed, a, non, virtuous, man, to, choose, a, principle, allowing, pleasure, ahead, of, one, requiring, moral, constraint, thomas, a, kempis, in, the, medieval, contemplative, classic, the, imitation, of, christ, ca, 1418, stated, that, the, glory, of, a, good, man, is, the, witness, of, a, good, conscience, preserve, a, quiet, conscience, and, you, will, always, have, joy, a, quiet, conscience, can, endure, much, and, remains, joyful, in, all, trouble, but, an, evil, conscience, is, always, fearful, and, uneasy, the, anonymous, medieval, author, of, the, christian, mystical, work, the, cloud, of, unknowing, similarly, expressed, the, view, that, in, profound, and, prolonged, contemplation, a, soul, dries, up, the, root, and, ground, of, the, sin, that, is, always, there, even, after, one, s, confession, and, however, busy, one, is, in, holy, things, therefore, whoever, would, work, at, becoming, a, contemplative, must, first, cleanse, his, conscience, the, medieval, flemish, mystic, john, of, ruysbroeck, likewise, held, that, true, conscience, has, four, aspects, that, are, necessary, to, render, a, man, just, in, the, active, and, contemplative, life, a, free, spirit, attracting, itself, through, love, an, intellect, enlightened, by, grace, a, delight, yielding, propension, or, inclination, and, an, outflowing, losing, of, oneself, in, the, abyss, of, that, eternal, object, which, is, the, highest, and, chief, blessedness, those, lofty, amongst, men, are, absorbed, in, it, and, immersed, in, a, certain, boundless, thing, benedict, de, spinoza, in, his, ethics, published, after, his, death, in, 1677, argued, that, most, people, even, those, that, consider, themselves, to, exercise, free, will, make, moral, decisions, on, the, basis, of, imperfect, sensory, information, inadequate, understanding, of, their, mind, and, will, as, well, as, emotions, which, are, both, outcomes, of, their, contingent, physical, existence, and, forms, of, thought, defective, from, being, chiefly, impelled, by, self, preservation, the, solution, according, to, spinoza, was, to, gradually, increase, the, capacity, of, our, reason, to, change, the, forms, of, thought, produced, by, emotions, and, to, fall, in, love, with, viewing, problems, requiring, moral, decision, from, the, perspective, of, eternity, thus, living, a, life, of, peaceful, conscience, means, to, spinoza, that, reason, is, used, to, generate, adequate, ideas, where, the, mind, increasingly, sees, the, world, and, its, conflicts, our, desires, and, passions, sub, specie, aeternitatis, that, is, without, reference, to, time, hegel, s, obscure, and, mystical, philosophy, of, mind, held, that, the, absolute, right, of, freedom, of, conscience, facilitates, human, understanding, of, an, all, embracing, unity, an, absolute, which, was, rational, real, and, true, nevertheless, hegel, thought, that, a, functioning, state, would, always, be, tempted, not, to, recognize, conscience, in, its, form, of, subjective, knowledge, just, as, similar, non, objective, opinions, are, generally, rejected, in, science, a, similar, idealist, notion, was, expressed, in, the, writings, of, joseph, butler, who, argued, that, conscience, is, god, given, should, always, be, obeyed, is, intuitive, and, should, be, considered, the, constitutional, monarch, and, the, universal, moral, faculty, conscience, does, not, only, offer, itself, to, show, us, the, way, we, should, walk, in, but, it, likewise, carries, its, own, authority, with, it, butler, advanced, ethical, speculation, by, referring, to, a, duality, of, regulative, principles, in, human, nature, first, self, love, seeking, individual, happiness, and, second, benevolence, compassion, and, seeking, good, for, another, in, conscience, also, linked, to, the, agape, of, situational, ethics, conscience, tended, to, be, more, authoritative, in, questions, of, moral, judgment, thought, butler, because, it, was, more, likely, to, be, clear, and, certain, whereas, calculations, of, self, interest, tended, to, probable, and, changing, conclusions, john, selden, in, his, table, talk, expressed, the, view, that, an, awake, but, excessively, scrupulous, or, ill, trained, conscience, could, hinder, resolve, and, practical, action, it, being, like, a, horse, that, is, not, well, wayed, he, starts, at, every, bird, that, flies, out, of, the, hedge, as, the, sacred, texts, of, ancient, hindu, and, buddhist, philosophy, became, available, in, german, translations, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, they, influenced, philosophers, such, as, schopenhauer, to, hold, that, in, a, healthy, mind, only, deeds, oppress, our, conscience, not, wishes, and, thoughts, for, it, is, only, our, deeds, that, hold, us, up, to, the, mirror, of, our, will, the, good, conscience, thought, schopenhauer, we, experience, after, every, disinterested, deed, arises, from, direct, recognition, of, our, own, inner, being, in, the, phenomenon, of, another, it, affords, us, the, verification, that, our, true, self, exists, not, only, in, our, own, person, this, particular, manifestation, but, in, everything, that, lives, by, this, the, heart, feels, itself, enlarged, as, by, egotism, it, is, contracted, immanuel, kant, a, central, figure, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, likewise, claimed, that, two, things, filled, his, mind, with, ever, new, and, increasing, admiration, and, awe, the, oftener, and, more, steadily, they, were, reflected, on, the, starry, heavens, above, me, and, the, moral, law, within, me, the, latter, begins, from, my, invisible, self, my, personality, and, exhibits, me, in, a, world, which, has, true, infinity, but, which, i, recognise, myself, as, existing, in, a, universal, and, necessary, and, not, only, as, in, the, first, case, contingent, connection, the, universal, connection, referred, to, here, is, kant, s, categorical, imperative, act, only, according, to, that, maxim, by, which, you, can, at, the, same, time, will, that, it, should, become, a, universal, law, kant, considered, critical, conscience, to, be, an, internal, court, in, which, our, thoughts, accuse, or, excuse, one, another, he, acknowledged, that, morally, mature, people, do, often, describe, contentment, or, peace, in, the, soul, after, following, conscience, to, perform, a, duty, but, argued, that, for, such, acts, to, produce, virtue, their, primary, motivation, should, simply, be, duty, not, expectation, of, any, such, bliss, rousseau, expressed, a, similar, view, that, conscience, somehow, connected, man, to, a, greater, metaphysical, unity, john, plamenatz, in, his, critical, examination, of, rousseau, s, work, considered, that, conscience, was, there, defined, as, the, feeling, that, urges, us, in, spite, of, contrary, passions, towards, two, harmonies, the, one, within, our, minds, and, between, our, passions, and, the, other, within, society, and, between, its, members, the, weakest, can, appeal, to, it, in, the, strongest, and, the, appeal, though, often, unsuccessful, is, always, disturbing, however, corrupted, by, power, or, wealth, we, may, be, either, as, possessors, of, them, or, as, victims, there, is, something, in, us, serving, to, remind, us, that, this, corruption, is, against, nature, other, philosophers, expressed, a, more, sceptical, and, pragmatic, view, of, the, operation, of, conscience, in, society, john, locke, in, his, essays, on, the, law, of, nature, argued, that, the, widespread, fact, of, human, conscience, allowed, a, philosopher, to, infer, the, necessary, existence, of, objective, moral, laws, that, occasionally, might, contradict, those, of, the, state, locke, highlighted, the, metaethics, problem, of, whether, accepting, a, statement, like, follow, your, conscience, supports, subjectivist, or, objectivist, conceptions, of, conscience, as, a, guide, in, concrete, morality, or, as, a, spontaneous, revelation, of, eternal, and, immutable, principles, to, the, individual, if, conscience, be, a, proof, of, innate, principles, contraries, may, be, innate, principles, since, some, men, with, the, same, bent, of, conscience, prosecute, what, others, avoid, thomas, hobbes, likewise, pragmatically, noted, that, opinions, formed, on, the, basis, of, conscience, with, full, and, honest, conviction, nevertheless, should, always, be, accepted, with, humility, as, potentially, erroneous, and, not, necessarily, indicating, absolute, knowledge, or, truth, william, godwin, expressed, the, view, that, conscience, was, a, memorable, consequence, of, the, perception, by, men, of, every, creed, when, the, descend, into, the, scene, of, busy, life, that, they, possess, free, will, adam, smith, considered, that, it, was, only, by, developing, a, critical, conscience, that, we, can, ever, see, what, relates, to, ourselves, in, its, proper, shape, and, dimensions, or, that, we, can, ever, make, any, proper, comparison, between, our, own, interests, and, those, of, other, people, john, stuart, mill, believed, that, idealism, about, the, role, of, conscience, in, government, should, be, tempered, with, a, practical, realisation, that, few, men, in, society, are, capable, of, directing, their, minds, or, purposes, towards, distant, or, unobvious, interests, of, disinterested, regard, for, others, and, especially, for, what, comes, after, them, for, the, idea, of, posterity, of, their, country, or, of, humanity, whether, grounded, on, sympathy, or, on, a, conscientious, feeling, mill, held, that, certain, amount, of, conscience, and, of, disinterested, public, spirit, may, fairly, be, calculated, on, in, the, citizens, of, any, community, ripe, for, representative, government, but, that, it, would, be, ridiculous, to, expect, such, a, degree, of, it, combined, with, such, intellectual, discernment, as, would, be, proof, against, any, plausible, fallacy, tending, to, make, that, which, was, for, their, class, interest, appear, the, dictate, of, justice, and, of, the, general, good, josiah, royce, 1855, 1916, built, on, the, transcendental, idealism, view, of, conscience, viewing, it, as, the, ideal, of, life, which, constitutes, our, moral, personality, our, plan, of, being, ourself, of, making, common, sense, ethical, decisions, but, he, thought, this, was, only, true, insofar, as, our, conscience, also, required, loyalty, to, a, mysterious, higher, or, deeper, self, in, the, modern, christian, tradition, this, approach, achieved, expression, with, dietrich, bonhoeffer, who, stated, during, his, imprisonment, by, the, nazis, in, world, war, ii, that, conscience, for, him, was, more, than, practical, reason, indeed, it, came, from, a, depth, which, lies, beyond, a, man, s, own, will, and, his, own, reason, and, it, makes, itself, heard, as, the, call, of, human, existence, to, unity, with, itself, for, bonhoeffer, a, guilty, conscience, arose, as, an, indictment, of, the, loss, of, this, unity, and, as, a, warning, against, the, loss, of, one, s, self, primarily, he, thought, it, is, directed, not, towards, a, particular, kind, of, doing, but, towards, a, particular, mode, of, being, it, protests, against, a, doing, which, imperils, the, unity, of, this, being, with, itself, conscience, for, bonhoeffer, did, not, like, shame, embrace, or, pass, judgment, on, the, morality, of, the, whole, of, its, owner, s, life, it, reacted, only, to, certain, definite, actions, it, recalls, what, is, long, past, and, represents, this, disunion, as, something, which, is, already, accomplished, and, irreparable, the, man, with, a, conscience, he, believed, fights, a, lonely, battle, against, the, overwhelming, forces, of, inescapable, situations, which, demand, moral, decisions, despite, the, likelihood, of, adverse, consequences, simon, soloveychik, has, similarly, claimed, that, the, truth, distributed, in, the, world, as, the, statement, about, human, dignity, as, the, affirmation, of, the, line, between, good, and, evil, lives, in, people, as, conscience, as, hannah, arendt, pointed, out, however, following, the, utilitarian, john, stuart, mill, on, this, point, a, bad, conscience, does, not, necessarily, signify, a, bad, character, in, fact, only, those, who, affirm, a, commitment, to, applying, moral, standards, will, be, troubled, with, remorse, guilt, or, shame, by, a, bad, conscience, and, their, need, to, regain, integrity, and, wholeness, of, the, self, representing, our, soul, or, true, self, by, analogy, as, our, house, arendt, wrote, that, conscience, is, the, anticipation, of, the, fellow, who, awaits, you, if, and, when, you, come, home, arendt, believed, that, people, who, are, unfamiliar, with, the, process, of, silent, critical, reflection, about, what, they, say, and, do, will, not, mind, contradicting, themselves, by, an, immoral, act, or, crime, since, they, can, count, on, its, being, forgotten, the, next, moment, bad, people, are, not, full, of, regrets, arendt, also, wrote, eloquently, on, the, problem, of, languages, distinguishing, the, word, consciousness, from, conscience, one, reason, she, held, was, that, conscience, as, we, understand, it, in, moral, or, legal, matters, is, supposedly, always, present, within, us, just, like, consciousness, and, this, conscience, is, also, supposed, to, tell, us, what, to, do, and, what, to, repent, before, it, became, the, lumen, naturale, or, kant, s, practical, reason, it, was, the, voice, of, god, albert, einstein, as, a, self, professed, adherent, of, humanism, and, rationalism, likewise, viewed, an, enlightened, religious, person, as, one, whose, conscience, reflects, that, he, has, to, the, best, of, his, ability, liberated, himself, from, the, fetters, of, his, selfish, desires, and, is, preoccupied, with, thoughts, feelings, and, aspirations, to, which, he, clings, because, of, their, super, personal, value, einstein, often, referred, to, the, inner, voice, as, a, source, of, both, moral, and, physical, knowledge, quantum, mechanics, is, very, impressive, but, an, inner, voice, tells, me, that, it, is, not, the, real, thing, the, theory, produces, a, good, deal, but, hardly, brings, one, closer, to, the, secrets, of, the, old, one, i, am, at, all, events, convinced, that, he, does, not, play, dice, simone, weil, who, fought, for, the, french, resistance, the, maquis, argued, in, her, final, book, the, need, for, roots, prelude, to, a, declaration, of, duties, towards, mankind, that, for, society, to, become, more, just, and, protective, of, liberty, obligations, should, take, precedence, over, rights, in, moral, and, political, philosophy, and, a, spiritual, awakening, should, occur, in, the, conscience, of, most, citizens, so, that, social, obligations, are, viewed, as, fundamentally, having, a, transcendent, origin, and, a, beneficent, impact, on, human, character, when, fulfilled, simone, weil, also, in, that, work, provided, a, psychological, explanation, for, the, mental, peace, associated, with, a, good, conscience, the, liberty, of, men, of, goodwill, though, limited, in, the, sphere, of, action, is, complete, in, that, of, conscience, for, having, incorporated, the, rules, into, their, own, being, the, prohibited, possibilities, no, longer, present, themselves, to, the, mind, and, have, not, to, be, rejected, alternatives, to, such, metaphysical, and, idealist, opinions, about, conscience, arose, from, realist, and, materialist, perspectives, such, as, those, of, charles, darwin, darwin, suggested, that, any, animal, whatever, endowed, with, well, marked, social, instincts, the, parental, and, filial, affections, being, here, included, would, inevitably, acquire, a, moral, sense, or, conscience, as, soon, as, its, intellectual, powers, had, become, as, well, or, as, nearly, as, well, developed, as, in, man, mile, durkheim, held, that, the, soul, and, conscience, were, particular, forms, of, an, impersonal, principle, diffused, in, the, relevant, group, and, communicated, by, totemic, ceremonies, aj, ayer, was, a, more, recent, realist, who, held, that, the, existence, of, conscience, was, an, empirical, question, to, be, answered, by, sociological, research, into, the, moral, habits, of, a, given, person, or, group, of, people, and, what, causes, them, to, have, precisely, those, habits, and, feelings, such, an, inquiry, he, believed, fell, wholly, within, the, scope, of, the, existing, social, sciences, george, edward, moore, bridged, the, idealistic, and, sociological, views, of, critical, and, traditional, conscience, in, stating, that, the, idea, of, abstract, rightness, and, the, various, degrees, of, the, specific, emotion, excited, by, it, are, what, constitute, for, many, persons, the, specifically, moral, sentiment, or, conscience, for, others, however, an, action, seems, to, be, properly, termed, internally, right, merely, because, they, have, previously, regarded, it, as, right, the, idea, of, rightness, being, present, in, some, way, to, his, or, her, mind, but, not, necessarily, among, his, or, her, deliberately, constructed, motives, the, french, philosopher, simone, de, beauvoir, in, a, very, easy, death, une, mort, tr, s, douce, 1964, reflects, within, her, own, conscience, about, her, mother, s, attempts, to, develop, such, a, moral, sympathy, and, understanding, of, others, the, sight, of, her, tears, grieved, me, but, i, soon, realised, that, she, was, weeping, over, her, failure, without, caring, about, what, was, happening, inside, me, we, might, still, have, come, to, an, understanding, if, instead, of, asking, everybody, to, pray, for, my, soul, she, had, given, me, a, little, confidence, and, sympathy, i, know, now, what, prevented, her, from, doing, so, she, had, too, much, to, pay, back, too, many, wounds, to, salve, to, put, herself, in, another, s, place, in, actual, doing, she, made, every, sacrifice, but, her, feelings, did, not, take, her, out, of, herself, besides, how, could, she, have, tried, to, understand, me, since, she, avoided, looking, into, her, own, heart, as, for, discovering, an, attitude, that, would, not, have, set, us, apart, nothing, in, her, life, had, ever, prepared, her, for, such, a, thing, the, unexpected, sent, her, into, a, panic, because, she, had, been, taught, never, to, think, act, or, feel, except, in, a, ready, made, framework, simone, de, beauvoir, a, very, easy, death, penguin, books, london, 1982, p, 60, michael, walzer, claimed, that, the, growth, of, religious, toleration, in, western, nations, arose, amongst, other, things, from, the, general, recognition, that, private, conscience, signified, some, inner, divine, presence, regardless, of, the, religious, faith, professed, and, from, the, general, respectability, piety, self, limitation, and, sectarian, discipline, which, marked, most, of, the, men, who, claimed, the, rights, of, conscience, walzer, also, argued, that, attempts, by, courts, to, define, conscience, as, a, merely, personal, moral, code, or, as, sincere, belief, risked, encouraging, an, anarchy, of, moral, egotisms, unless, such, a, code, and, motive, was, necessarily, tempered, with, shared, moral, knowledge, derived, either, from, the, connection, of, the, individual, to, a, universal, spiritual, order, or, from, the, common, principles, and, mutual, engagements, of, unselfish, people, ronald, dworkin, maintains, that, constitutional, protection, of, freedom, of, conscience, is, central, to, democracy, but, creates, personal, duties, to, live, up, to, it, freedom, of, conscience, presupposes, a, personal, responsibility, of, reflection, and, it, loses, much, of, its, meaning, when, that, responsibility, is, ignored, a, good, life, need, not, be, an, especially, reflective, one, most, of, the, best, lives, are, just, lived, rather, than, studied, but, there, are, moments, that, cry, out, for, self, assertion, when, a, passive, bowing, to, fate, or, a, mechanical, decision, out, of, deference, or, convenience, is, treachery, because, it, forfeits, dignity, for, ease, edward, conze, stated, it, is, important, for, individual, and, collective, moral, growth, that, we, recognise, the, illusion, of, our, conscience, being, wholly, located, in, our, body, indeed, both, our, conscience, and, wisdom, expand, when, we, act, in, an, unselfish, way, and, conversely, repressed, compassion, results, in, an, unconscious, sense, of, guilt, the, philosopher, peter, singer, considers, that, usually, when, we, describe, an, action, as, conscientious, in, the, critical, sense, we, do, so, in, order, to, deny, either, that, the, relevant, agent, was, motivated, by, selfish, desires, like, greed, or, ambition, or, that, he, acted, on, whim, or, impulse, moral, anti, realists, debate, whether, the, moral, facts, necessary, to, activate, conscience, supervene, on, natural, facts, with, a, posteriori, necessity, or, arise, a, priori, because, moral, facts, have, a, primary, intension, and, naturally, identical, worlds, may, be, presumed, morally, identical, it, has, also, been, argued, that, there, is, a, measure, of, moral, luck, in, how, circumstances, create, the, obstacles, which, conscience, must, overcome, to, apply, moral, principles, or, human, rights, and, that, with, the, benefit, of, enforceable, property, rights, and, the, rule, of, law, access, to, universal, health, care, plus, the, absence, of, high, adult, and, infant, mortality, from, conditions, such, as, malaria, tuberculosis, hiv, aids, and, famine, people, in, relatively, prosperous, developed, countries, have, been, spared, pangs, of, conscience, associated, with, the, physical, necessity, to, steal, scraps, of, food, bribe, tax, inspectors, or, police, officers, and, commit, murder, in, guerrilla, wars, against, corrupt, government, forces, or, rebel, armies, roger, scruton, has, claimed, that, true, understanding, of, conscience, and, its, relationship, with, morality, has, been, hampered, by, an, impetuous, belief, that, philosophical, questions, are, solved, through, the, analysis, of, language, in, an, area, where, clarity, threatens, vested, interests, susan, sontag, similarly, argued, that, it, was, a, symptom, of, psychological, immaturity, not, to, recognise, that, many, morally, immature, people, willingly, experience, a, form, of, delight, in, some, an, erotic, breaking, of, taboo, when, witnessing, violence, suffering, and, pain, being, inflicted, on, others, jonathan, glover, wrote, that, most, of, us, do, not, spend, our, lives, on, endless, landscape, gardening, of, our, self, and, our, conscience, is, likely, shaped, not, so, much, by, heroic, struggles, as, by, choice, of, partner, friends, and, job, as, well, as, where, we, choose, to, live, garrett, hardin, in, a, famous, article, called, the, tragedy, of, the, commons, argues, that, any, instance, in, which, society, appeals, to, an, individual, exploiting, a, commons, to, restrain, himself, or, herself, for, the, general, good, by, means, of, his, or, her, conscience, merely, sets, up, a, system, which, by, selectively, diverting, societal, power, and, physical, resources, to, those, lacking, in, conscience, while, fostering, guilt, including, anxiety, about, his, or, her, individual, contribution, to, over, population, in, people, acting, upon, it, actually, works, toward, the, elimination, of, conscience, from, the, race, john, ralston, saul, expressed, the, view, in, the, unconscious, civilization, that, in, contemporary, developed, nations, many, people, have, acquiesced, in, turning, over, their, sense, of, right, and, wrong, their, critical, conscience, to, technical, experts, willingly, restricting, their, moral, freedom, of, choice, to, limited, consumer, actions, ruled, by, the, ideology, of, the, free, market, while, citizen, participation, in, public, affairs, is, limited, to, the, isolated, act, of, voting, and, private, interest, lobbying, turns, even, elected, representatives, against, the, public, interest, some, argue, on, religious, or, philosophical, grounds, that, it, is, blameworthy, to, act, against, conscience, even, if, the, judgement, of, conscience, is, likely, to, be, erroneous, say, because, it, is, inadequately, informed, about, the, facts, or, prevailing, moral, humanist, or, religious, professional, ethical, legal, and, human, rights, norms, failure, to, acknowledge, and, accept, that, conscientious, judgements, can, be, seriously, mistaken, may, only, promote, situations, where, one, s, conscience, is, manipulated, by, others, to, provide, unwarranted, justifications, for, non, virtuous, and, selfish, acts, indeed, insofar, as, it, is, appealed, to, as, glorifying, ideological, content, and, an, associated, extreme, level, of, devotion, without, adequate, constraint, of, external, altruistic, normative, justification, conscience, may, be, considered, morally, blind, and, dangerous, both, to, the, individual, concerned, and, humanity, as, a, whole, langston, argues, that, philosophers, of, virtue, ethics, have, unnecessarily, neglected, conscience, for, once, conscience, is, trained, so, that, the, principles, and, rules, it, applies, are, those, one, would, want, all, others, to, live, by, its, practise, cultivates, and, sustains, the, virtues, indeed, amongst, people, in, what, each, society, considers, to, be, the, highest, state, of, moral, development, there, is, little, disagreement, about, how, to, act, emmanuel, levinas, viewed, conscience, as, a, revelatory, encountering, of, resistance, to, our, selfish, powers, developing, morality, by, calling, into, question, our, naive, sense, of, freedom, of, will, to, use, such, powers, arbitrarily, or, with, violence, this, process, being, more, severe, the, more, rigorously, the, goal, of, our, self, was, to, obtain, control, in, other, words, the, welcoming, of, the, other, to, levinas, was, the, very, essence, of, conscience, properly, conceived, it, encouraged, our, ego, to, accept, the, fallibility, of, assuming, things, about, other, people, that, selfish, freedom, of, will, does, not, have, the, last, word, and, that, realising, this, has, a, transcendent, purpose, i, am, not, alone, in, conscience, i, have, an, experience, that, is, not, commensurate, with, any, a, priori, framework, a, conceptless, experience, in, the, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, english, litigants, began, to, petition, the, lord, chancellor, of, england, for, relief, from, unjust, judgments, as, keeper, of, the, king, s, conscience, the, chancellor, intervened, to, allow,

chancellor, s, decisions, evolved, into, the, body, of, law, known, as, equity, english, humanist, lawyers, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, interpreted, conscience, as, a, collection, of, universal, principles, given, to, man, by, god, at, creation, to, be, applied, by, reason, this, gradually, reforming, the, medieval, roman, law, based, system, with, forms, of, action, written, pleadings, use, of, juries, and, patterns, of, litigation, such, as, demurrer, and, assumpsit, that, displayed, an, increased, concern, for, elements, of, right, and, wrong, on, the, actual, facts, a,

not, excused, on, the, ground, that, the, person, considered, his, behaviour, required, by, his, conscience, or, the, prescripts, of, his, religion, the, united, nations, universal, declaration, on,

teaching, it, has, been, argued, that, these, articles, provide, international, legal, obligations, protecting, conscientious, objectors, from, service, in, the, military, john, rawls, in, his, a, theory, of, justice, defines, a, conscientious, objector, as, an, individual, prepared, to, undertake, in, public, and, often, despite, widespread, condemnation, an, action, of, civil, disobedience, to, a, legal, rule, justifying, it, also, in, public, by, reference, to, contrary, foundational, social, virtues, such, as, justice, as, liberty, or, fairness, and, the, principles, of, morality, and, law, derived, from, them, rawls, considered, civil, disobedience, should, be, viewed, as, an, appeal, warning, or, admonishment, showing, general, respect, and, fidelity, to, the, rule, of, law, by, the, non, violence, and, transparency, of, methods, adopted, that, a, law, breaches, a, community, s, fundamental, virtue, of, justice, objections, to, rawls, theory, include, first, its, inability, to, accommodate, conscientious, objections, to, the, society, s, basic, appreciation, of, justice, or, to, emerging, moral, or, ethical, principles, such, as, respect, for, the, rights, of, the, natural, environment, which, are, not, yet, part, of, it, and, second, the, difficulty, of, predictably, and, consistently, determining, that, a, majority, decision, is, just, or, unjust, conscientious, objection, also, called, conscientious, refusal, or, evasion, to, obeying, a, law, should, not, arise, from, unreasoning, naive, traditional, conscience, for, to, do, so, merely, encourages, infantile, abdication, of, responsibility, to, calibrate, the, law, against, moral, or, human, rights, norms, and, disrespect, for, democratic, institutions, instead, it, should, be, based, on, critical, conscience, seriously, thought, out, conceptually, mature, personal, moral, or, religious, beliefs, held, to, be, fundamentally, incompatible, that, is, not, merely, inconsistent,

support, the, state, in, a, particular, war, a, famous, example, arose, when, henry, david, thoreau, the, author, of, walden, was, willingly, jailed, for, refusing, to, pay, a, tax, because, he, profoundly, disagreed, with, a, government, policy, and, was, frustrated, by, the, corruption, and, injustice, of, the, democratic, machinery, of, the, state, a, more, recent, case, concerned, kimberly, rivera, a, private, in, the, us, army, and, mother, of, four, children, who, having, served, 3, months, in, iraq, war, decided, the, conflict, was, immoral, and, sought, refugee, status, in,

not, necessary, that, he, should, do, something, wrong, it, is, for, no, particular, item, in, the, tax, bill, that, i, refuse, to, pay, it, i, simply, wish, to, refuse, allegiance, to, the, state, to, withdraw, and, stand, aloof, from, it, effectually, i, do, not, care, to, trace, the, course, of, my, dollar, if, i, could, till, it, buys, a, man, or, a, musket, to, shoot, one, with, the,

great, britain, granted, conscientious, objection, status, not, just, to, complete, pacifists, but, to, those, who, objected, to, fighting, in, that, particular, war, this, was, done, partly, out, of, genuine, respect, but, also, to, avoid, the, disgraceful, and, futile, persecutions, of, conscientious, objectors, that, occurred, during, the, first, world, war, amnesty, international, organises, campaigns, to, protect, those, arrested, and, or, incarcerated, as, a, prisoner, of, conscience, because, of, their, conscientious, beliefs, particularly, concerning, intellectual, political, and, artistic, freedom, of, expression, and, association, aung, san, suu, kyi, of, burma, was, the, winner, of, the, 2009, amnesty, international, ambassador, of, conscience, award, in, legislation, a, conscience, clause, is, a, provision, in, a, statute, that, excuses, a, health, professional, from, complying, with, the, law, for, example, legalising, surgical, or, pharmaceutical, abortion, if, it, is, incompatible, with, religious, or, conscientious, beliefs, expressed, justifications, for, refusing, to, obey, laws, because, of, conscience, vary, many, conscientious, objectors, are, so, for, religious, reasons, notably, members, of, the, historic, peace, churches, are, pacifist, by, doctrine, other, objections, can, stem, from, a, deep, sense, of, responsibility, toward, humanity, as, a, whole, or, from, the, conviction, that, even, acceptance, of, work, under, military, orders, acknowledges, the, principle, of, conscription, that, should, be, everywhere, condemned, before, the, world, can, ever, become, safe, for, real, democracy, a, conscientious, objector, however, does, not, have, a, primary, aim, of, changing, the, law, john, dewey, considered, that, conscientious, objectors, were, often, the, victims, of, moral, innocency, and, inexpertness, in, moral, training, the, moving, force, of, events, is, always, too, much, for, conscience, the, remedy, was, not, to, deplore, the, wickedness, of, those, who, manipulate, world, power, but, to, connect, conscience, with, forces, moving, in, another, direction, to, build, institutions, and, social, environments, predicated, on, the, rule, of, law, for, example, then, will, conscience, itself, have, compulsive, power, instead, of, being, forever, the, martyred, and, the, coerced, as, an, example, albert, einstein, who, had, advocated, conscientious, objection, during, the, first, world, war, and, had, been, a, longterm, supporter, of, war, resisters, international, reasoned, that, radical, pacifism, could, not, be, justified, in, the, face, of, nazi, rearmament, and, advocated, a, world, federalist, organization, with, its, own, professional, army, samuel, johnson, pointed, out, that, an, appeal, to, conscience, should, not, allow, the, law, to, bring, unjust, suffering, upon, another, conscience, according, to, johnson, was, nothing, more, than, a, conviction, felt, by, ourselves, of, something, to, be, done, or, something, to, be, avoided, in, questions, of, simple, unperplexed, morality, conscience, is, very, often, a, guide, that, may, be, trusted, but, before, conscience, can, conclusively, determine, what, morally, should, be, done, he, thought, that, the, state, of, the, question, should, be, thoroughly, known, no, man, s, conscience, said, johnson, can, tell, him, the, right, of, another, man, it, is, a, conscience, very, ill, informed, that, violates, the, rights, of, one, man, for, the, convenience, of, another, civil, disobedience, as, non, violent, protest, or, civil, resistance, are, also, acts, of, conscience, but, are, designed, by, those, who, undertake, them, chiefly, to, change, by, appealing, to, the, majority, and, democratic, processes, laws, or, government, policies, perceived, to, be, incoherent, with, fundamental, social, virtues, and, principles, such, as, justice, equality, or, respect, for, intrinsic, human, dignity, civil, disobedience, in, a, properly, functioning, democracy, allows, a, minority, who, feel, strongly, that, a, law, infringes, their, sense, of, justice, but, have, no, capacity, to, obtain, legislative, amendments, or, a, referendum, on, the, issue, to, make, a, potentially, apathetic, or, uninformed, majority, take, account, of, the, intensity, of, opposing, views, a, notable, example, of, civil, resistance, or,
