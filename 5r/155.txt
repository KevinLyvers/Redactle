held, a, dominant, role, in, pre, revolutionary, france, during, a, two, year, period, known, as, the, reign, of, terror, the, episodes, of, anti, clericalism, grew, more, violent, than, europe, would, see, until, the, rise, of, state, atheism, in, communist, eastern, europe, the, new, revolutionary, authorities, suppressed, the, church, abolished, the, catholic, monarchy, nationalized, church, property, exiled, 30, 000, priests, and, killed, hundreds, more, many, churches, were, converted, into, temples, of, reason, in, which, atheistical, services, were, held, there, has, been, much, scholarly, debate, over, whether, the, movement, was, popularly, motivated, as, part, of, the, campaign, to, dechristianize, france, in, october, 1793, the, christian, calendar, was, replaced, with, one, reckoning, from, the, date, of, the, revolution, and, festivals, of, liberty, reason, and, the, supreme, being, were, scheduled, new, forms, of, moral, religion, emerged, including, the,

dechristianization, and, forced, members, of, the, clergy, who, had, resigned, to, conduct, mass, again, eventually, maximilien, robespierre, and, the, committee, of, public, safety, denounced, the, dechristianization, campaign, and, tried, to, establish, their, own, religion, without, the, superstitions, of, catholicism, when, pope, pius, vi, took, sides, against, the, revolution, in, the, first, coalition, 1792, 1797, napoleon, bonaparte, invaded, italy, 1796, french, troops, imprisoned, the, pope, in, 1797, and, he, died, after, six, weeks, of, captivity, after, a, change, of, heart,

continued, when, napoleonic, armies, entered, a, territory, monasteries, were, often, sacked, and, church, property, secularized, a, further, phase, of, anti, clericalism, occurred, in, the, context, of, the, french, third, republic, and, its, dissensions, with, the, catholic, church, after, the, concordat, of, 1801, the, catholic, church, enjoyed, preferential, treatment, from, the, french, state, formally, along, with, the, jewish, lutheran, and, calvinist, minority, religions, but, in, practice, with, much, more, influence, than, those, during, the, 19th, century, public, schools, employed, primarily, priests, as, teachers, and, religion, was, taught, in, schools, teachers, also, lead, the, class, to, mass, this, changed, during, the, 1880s, as, several, anti, clerical,

temporal, demise, in, 25, years, duterte, however, has, underscored, that, his, animosity, toward, the, church, was, purely, personal, and, warned, the, otherwise, uninvolved, public, against, taking, unethical, action, against, the, clergy, in, french, canada, following, the, conquest, much, like, in, ireland, or, poland, under, foreign, rule, the, catholic, church, was, the, sole, national, institution, not, under, the, direct, control, of, the, british, colonial, government, it, was, also, a, major, marker, of, social, difference, from, the, incoming, anglo, protestant, settlers, french, canadian, identity, was, almost, entirely, centred, around, catholicism, and, to, a, much, lesser, extent, the, french, language, however, there, was, a, small, anti, clerical, movement, in, french, canada, in, the, early, nineteenth, drawing, inspiration, from, american, and, french, liberal, revolutions, this, group, was, one, current, but, by, no, means, the, dominant, one, in, the, parti, canadien, and, its, associated, lower, canada, rebellion, of, 1837, in, the, more, democratic, politics, that, followed, the, rebellions, the, more, radical, and, anti, clerical, tendency, eventually, formed, the, parti, rouge, in, 1848, at, the, same, time, in, english, canada, a, related, phenomenon, occurred, where, the, primarily, nonconformist, mostly, presbyterian, and, methodist, reform, movement, conflicted, with, an, anglican, establishment, in, upper, canada, the, reform, movement, began, as, protest, against, the, establishment, of, the, anglican, church, the, vastly, different, religious, backgrounds, of, the, reformers, and, rouges, was, one, of, the, factors, which, prevented, them, from, working, together, well, during, the, era, of, two, party, coalition, government, in, canada, 1840, 1867, by, 1861, however, the, two, groups, fused, to, create, a, united, liberal, block, after, 1867, this, party, added, like, minded, reformers, from, the, maritime, provinces, but, struggled, to, win, power, especially, in, still, strongly, catholic, quebec, once, wilfrid, laurier, became, party, leader, however, the, party, dropped, its, anti, clerical, stance, and, went, on, to, dominate, canadian, politics, throughout, most, of, the, 20th, century, since, that, time, liberal, prime, ministers, have, been, overwhelmingly, catholic, st, laurent, both, pierre, and, justin, trudeau, chr, tien, martin, but, since, the, 1960s, liberals, have, again, had, a, strained, relationship, with, the, catholic, church, and, have, increasingly, parted, with, the, catholic, church, s, teachings, on, sexual, morality, as, when, pierre, trudeau, legalized, homosexuality, and, streamlined, divorce, as, justice, minister, under, pearson, and, martin, legalized, same, sex, marriage, in, quebec, itself, the, quiet, revolution, of, the, 1960s, broke, the, hold, of, the, church, on, provincial, politics, the, quebec, liberal, party, embraced, formerly, taboo, social, democratic, ideas, and, the, state, intervened, in, fields, once, dominated, by, the, church, especially, health, and, education, which, were, taken, over, by, the, provincial, government, quebec, is, now, considered, canada, s, most, secular, province, although, anti, clericalism, is, more, often, spoken, of, regarding, the, history, or, current, politics, of, latin, countries, where, the, catholic, church, was, established, and, where, the, clergy, had, privileges, philip, jenkins, notes, in, his, 2003, book, the, new, anti, catholicism, that, the, u, s, despite, the, lack, of, catholic, establishments, has, always, had, anti, clericals, of, the, population, of, latin, america, about, 71, acknowledge, allegiance, to, the, catholic, church, consequently, about, 43, of, the, world, s, catholics, inhabit, the, latin, countries, of, south, central, and, north, america, the, slowness, to, embrace, religious, freedom, in, latin, america, is, related, to, its, colonial, heritage, and, to, its, post, colonial, history, the, aztec, maya, and, inca, cultures, made, substantial, use, of, religious, leaders, to, ideologically, support, governing, authority, and, power, this, pre, existing, role, of, religion, as, ideological, adjunct, to, the, state, in, pre, columbian, culture, made, it, relatively, easy, for, the, spanish, conquistadors, to, replace, native, religious, structures, with, those, of, a, catholicism, that, was, closely, linked, to, the, spanish, throne, anti, clericalism, was, a, common, feature, of, 19th, century, liberalism, in, latin, america, this, anti, clericalism, was, often, purportedly, based, on, the, idea, that, the, clergy, especially, the, prelates, who, ran, the, administrative, offices, of, the, church, were, hindering, social, progress, in, areas, such, as, public, education, and, economic, development, beginning, in, the, 1820s, a, succession, of, liberal, regimes, came, to, power, in, latin, america, some, members, of, these, liberal, regimes, sought, to, imitate, the, spain, of, the, 1830s, and, revolutionary, france, of, a, half, century, earlier, in, expropriating, the, wealth, of, the, catholic, church, and, in, imitating, the, 18th, century, benevolent, despots, in, restricting, or, prohibiting, the, religious, orders, as, a, result, a, number, of, these, liberal, regimes, expropriated, church, property, and, tried, to, bring, education, marriage, and, burial, under, secular, authority, the, confiscation, of, church, properties, and, changes, in, the, scope, of, religious, liberties, in, general, increasing, the, rights, of, non, catholics, and, non, observant, catholics, while, licensing, or, prohibiting, the, orders, generally, accompanied, secularist, and, governmental, reforms, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1824, had, required, the, republic, to, prohibit, the, exercise, of, any, religion, other, than, the, catholic, faith, starting, in, 1855, president, benito, ju, rez, issued, decrees, nationalizing, church, property, separating, church, and, state, and, suppressing, religious, orders, church, properties, were, confiscated, and, basic, civil, and, political, rights, were, denied, to, religious, orders, and, the, clergy, more, severe, laws, called, calles, law, during, the, rule, of, plutarco, el, as, calles, eventually, led, to, the, cristero,

only, 334, priests, licensed, by, the, government, to, serve, fifteen, million, people, the, rest, having, been, eliminated, by, emigration, expulsion, and, assassination, it, appears, that, ten,

cases, public, school, teachers, were, tortured, and, murdered, by, the, former, cristero, rebels, it, is, calculated, that, almost, 300, rural, teachers, were, murdered, in, this, way, between, 1935, and, 1939, this, issue, was, one, of, the, bases, for, the, lasting, dispute, between, conservatives, who, represented, primarily, the, interests, of, the, sierra, and, the, church, and, the, liberals, who, represented, those, of, the, costa, and, anti, clericalism, tensions, came, to, a, head, in, 1875, when, the, conservative, president, gabriel, garc, a, moreno, after, being, elected, to, his, third, term, was, allegedly, assassinated, by, anti, clerical, freemasons, colombia, enacted, anti, clerical, legislation, and, its, enforcement, during, more, than, three, decades, 1849, 84, la, violencia, refers, to, an, era, of, civil, conflict, in, various, areas, of, the, colombian, countryside, between, supporters, of, the, colombian, liberal, party, and, the, colombian, conservative, party, a, conflict, which, took, place, roughly, from, 1948, to, 1958, across, the, country, militants, attacked, churches, convents, and, monasteries, killing, priests, and, looking, for, arms, since, the, conspiracy, theory, maintained, that, the, religious, had, guns, and, this, despite, the, fact, that, not, a, single, serviceable, weapon, was, located, in, the, raids, when, their, party, came, to, power, in, 1930, anti, clerical, liberals, pushed, for, legislation, to, end, church, influence, in, public, schools, these, liberals, held, that, the, church, and, its, intellectual, backwardness, were, responsible, for, a, lack, of, spiritual, and, material, progress, in, colombia, liberal, controlled, local, departmental, and, national, governments, ended, contracts, with, religious, communities, who, operated, schools, in, government, owned, buildings, and, set, up, secular, schools, in, their, place, these, actions, were, sometimes, violent, and, were, met, by, a, strong, opposition, from, clerics, conservatives, and, even, a, good, number, of, more, moderate, liberals, the, original, argentine, constitution, of, 1853, provided, that, all, argentine, presidents, must, be, catholic, and, stated, that, the, duty, of, the, argentine, congress, was, to, convert, the, indians, to, catholicism, all, of, these, provisions, have, been, eliminated, with, the, exception, of, the, mandate, to, sustain, catholicism, liberal, anti, clericalists, of, the, 1880s, established, a, new, pattern, of, church, state, relations, in, which, the, official, constitutional, status, of, the, church, was, preserved, while, the, state, assumed, control, of, many, functions, formerly, the, province, of, the, church, conservative, catholics, asserting, their, role, as, definers, of, national, values, and, morality, responded, in, part, by, joining, in, the, rightist, religio, political, movement, known, as, catholic, nationalism, which, formed, successive, opposition, parties, this, began, a, prolonged, period, of, conflict, between, church, and, state, that, persisted, until, the, 1940s, when, the, church, enjoyed, a, restoration, of, its, former, status, under, the, presidency, of, colonel, juan, per, n, per, n, claimed, that, peronism, was, the, true, embodiment, of, catholic, social, teaching, indeed, more, the, embodiment, of, catholicism, than, the, catholic, church, itself, in, 1954, argentina, saw, extensive, destruction, of, churches, denunciations, of, clergy, and, confiscation, of, catholic, schools, as, per, n, attempted, to, extend, state, control, over, national, institutions, the, renewed, rupture, in, church, state, relations, was, completed, when, per, n, was, excommunicated, however, in, 1955, he, was, overthrown, by, a, military, general, who, was, a, leading, member, of, the, catholic, nationalist, movement, in, venezuela, the, government, of, antonio, guzm, n, blanco, in, office, from, 1870, to, 1877, from, 1879, to, 1884, and, from, 1886, to, 1887, virtually, crushed, the, institutional, life, of, the, church, even, attempting, to, legalize, the, marriage, of, priests, these, anti, clerical, policies, remained, in, force, for, decades, afterward, cuba, under, the, rule, of, atheist, fidel, castro, succeeded, in, reducing, the, church, s, ability, to, work, by, deporting, the, archbishop, and, 150, spanish, priests, by, discriminating, against, catholics, in, public, life, and, education, and, by, refusing, to, accept, them, as, members, of, the, communist, party, the, subsequent, flight, of, 300, 000, people, from, the, island, also, helped, to, diminish, the, church, there, a, number, of, countries, have, practiced, state, atheism, most, of, them, though, not, all, were, communist, states, in, the, soviet, union, anti, clericalism, was, expressed, through, the, state, in, the, first, five, years, alone, after, the, bolshevik, revolution, 28, bishops, and, 1, 200, priests, were, executed, traditionally, muslims, who, are, not, experts, in, islamic, jurisprudence, fiqh, are, legally, required, in, islam, to, follow, or, imitate, the, instructions, of, the, expert, i, e, the, mujtahid, with, the, exception, of, matters, of, belief, or, usulu, d, din, they, are, to, obey, or, imitate, the, experts, in, a, broad, range, of, matters, a, practice, known, as, taqlid, in, practice, this, means, asking, a, cleric, trained, in, islamic, law, for, a, fatwa, on, the, issue, the, muslim, is, concerned, about, in, shia, islam, this, practice, was, somewhat, more, systematic, and, as, of, the, 19th, century, the, shia, ulama, taught, believers, to, turn, to, the, highest, ranking, clerics, known, as, sources, of, taqlid, marja, at, taqlid, following, the, 1979, islamic, revolution, in, iran, the, one, muslim, country, where, shia, form, an, overwhelming, majority, even, more, systematic, power, was, given, to, clerics, under, the, doctrine, of, rule, by, islamic, jurists, or, velayat, e, faqih, islamic, clerics, must, rule, or, islam, will, whither, away, a, cleric, is, head, of, state, in, iran, and, clerics, control, many, powerful, governmental, positions, during, the, first, democratic, revolution, of, asia, the, iranian, constitutional, revolution, the, shia, marja, akhund, khurasani, and, his, colleagues, theorized, a, model, of, religious, secularity, in, the, absence, of, imam, that, still, prevails, in, shia, seminaries, in, absence, of, the, ideal, ruler, that, is, imam, al, mahdi, democracy, was, the, best, available, option, he, considers, opposition, to, constitutional, democracy, as, hostility, towards, the, twelfth, imam, he, declared, his, full, support, for, constitutional, democracy, and, announced, that, objection, to, foundations, of, constitutionalism, was, un, islamic, according, to, akhund, a, rightful, religion, imposes, conditions, on, the, actions, and, behavior, of, human, beings, which, stem, from, either, holy, text, or, logical, reasoning, and, these, constraints, are, essentially, meant, to, prevent, despotism, he, believes, that, an, islamic, system, of, governance, can, not, be, established, without, the, infallible, imam, leading, it, thus, the, clergy, and, modern, scholars, have, concluded, that, a, proper, legislation, can, help, reduce, the, state, tyranny, and, maintain, peace, and, security, he, said, persian, english, according, to, shia, doctrine, only, the, infallible, imam, has, the, right, to, govern, to, run, the, affairs, of, the, people, to, solve, the, problems, of, the, muslim, society, and, to, make, important, decisions, as, it, was, in, the, time, of, the, prophets, or, in, the, time, of, the, caliphate, of, the, commander, of, the, faithful, and, as, it, will, be, in, the, time, of, the, reappearance, and, return, of, the, mahdi, if, the, absolute, guardianship, is, not, with, the, infallible, then, it, will, be, a, non, islamic, government, since, this, is, a, time, of, occultation, there, can, be, two, types, of, non, islamic, regimes, the, first, is, a, just, democracy, in, which, the, affairs, of, the, people, are, in, the, hands, of, faithful, and, educated, men, and, the, second, is, a, government, of, tyranny, in, which, a, dictator, has, absolute, powers, therefore, both, in, the, eyes, of, the, sharia, and, reason, what, is, just, prevails, over, the, unjust, from, human, experience, and, careful, reflection, it, has, become, clear, that, democracy, reduces, the, tyranny, of, state, and, it, is, obligatory, to, give, precedence, to, the, lesser, evil, as, sanctioned, by, sacred, law, and, religion, akhund, believes, a, theocratic, government, can, only, be, formed, by, the, infallible, imam, aqa, buzurg, tehrani, also, quoted, akhund, khurasani, saying, that, if, there, was, a, possibility, of, establishment, of, a, truly, legitimate, islamic, rule, in, any, age, god, must, end, occultation, of, the, imam, of, age, hence, he, refuted, the, idea, of, absolute, guardianship, of, jurist, therefore, according, to, akhund, shia, jurists, must, support, the, democratic, reform, he, prefers, collective, wisdom, persian, over, individual, opinions, and, limits, the, role, of, jurist, to, provide, religious, guidance, in, personal, affairs, of, a, believer, he, defines, democracy, as, a, system, of, governance, that, enforces, a, set, of, limitations, and, conditions, on, the, head, of, state, and, government, employees, so, that, they, work, within, boundaries, that, the, laws, and, religion, of, every, nation, determines, akhund, believes, that, modern, secular, laws, complement, traditional, religion, he, asserts, that, both, religious, rulings, and, the, laws, outside, the, scope, of, religion, confront, state, despotism, constitutionalism, is, based, on, the, idea, of, defending, the, nation, s, inherent, and, natural, liberties, and, as, absolute, power, corrupts, a, democratic, distribution, of, power, would, make, it, possible, for, the, nation, to, live, up, to, its, full, potential, in, 1925, rez, khan, proclaimed, himself, shah, of, the, country, as, part, of, his, westernization, program, the, traditional, role, of, the, ruling, clergy, was, minimized, islamic, schools, were, secularized, women, were, forbidden, to, wear, the, hijab, sharia, law, was, abolished, and, men, and, women, were, desegregated, in, educational, and, religious, environments, all, this, infuriated, the, ultraconservative, clergy, as, a, class, rez, khan, s, son, and, heir, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, continued, such, practices, they, ultimately, contributed, to, the, islamic, revolution, of, 1978, 79, and, the, shah, s, flight, from, his, country, when, ayatollah, khomeini, took, power, a, month, after, the, revolution, the, shah, s, anti, clerical, measures, were, largely, overturned, replaced, by, an, islamic, republic, based, on, the, principle, of, rule, by, islamic, jurists, velayat, e, faqih, where, clerics, serve, as, heads, of, state, and, judges, veto, legislation, they, consider, un, islamic, and, control, who, may, run, for, president, or, parliament, however, by, the, late, 1990s, and, 2000s, anti, clericalism, was, reported, to, be, significant, in, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, iran, although, an, islamic, state, imbued, with, religion, and, religious, symbolism, is, an, increasingly, anti, clerical, country, in, a, sense, it, resembles, some, catholic, countries, where, religion, is, taken, for, granted, without, public, display, and, with, ambiguous, feelings, towards, the, clergy, iranians, tend, to, mock, their, mullahs, making, mild, jokes, about, them, demonstrators, using, slogans, such, as, the, clerics, live, like, kings, while, we, live, in, poverty, one, report, claims, working, class, iranian, lamented, clerical, wealth, in, the, face, of, their, own, poverty, and, stories, about, swiss, bank, accounts, of, leading, clerics, circulated, on, tehran, s, rumor, mill, during, the, fall, of, suharto, in, 1998, a, witch, hunt, in, banyuwangi, against, alleged, sorcerers, spiraled, into, widespread, riots, and, violence, in, addition, to, alleged, sorcerers, islamic, clerics, were, also, targeted, and, killed, nahdlatul, ulama, members, were, murdered, by, rioters, according, to, the, 1913, catholic, encyclopedia, freemasonry, was, historically, viewed, by, the, catholic, church, as, being, a, principal, source, of, anti, clericalism, especially, in, but, not, limited, to, historically, catholic, countries
