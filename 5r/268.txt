buddhism, the, term, tantra, in, the, indian, traditions, also, means, any, systematic, broadly, applicable, text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique, or, practice, a, key, feature, of, these, traditions, is, the, use, of, mantras, and, thus, they, are, commonly, referred, to, as, mantram, rga, path, of, mantra, in, hinduism, or, mantray, na, mantra, vehicle, and, guhyamantra, secret, mantra, in, buddhism, in, buddhism, the, vajrayana, traditions, are, known, for, tantric, ideas, and, practices, which, are, based, on, indian, buddhist, tantras, they, include, indo, tibetan, buddhism, chinese, esoteric, buddhism, japanese, shingon, buddhism, and, nepalese, newar, buddhism, although, southern, esoteric, buddhism, does, not, directly, reference, the, tantras, its, practices, and, ideas, parallel, them, in, buddhism, tantra, has, influenced, the, art, and, iconography, of, tibetan, and, east, asian, buddhism, as, well, as, historic, cave, temples, of, india, and, the, art, of, southeast, asia, tantric, hindu, and, buddhist, traditions, have, also, influenced, other, eastern, religious, traditions, such, as, jainism, the, tibetan, b, n, tradition, daoism, and, the, japanese, shint, tradition, certain, modes, of, non, vedic, worship, such, as, puja, are, considered, tantric, in, their, conception, and, rituals, hindu, temple, building, also, generally, conforms, to, the, iconography, of, tantra, hindu, texts, describing, these, topics, are, called, tantras, gamas, or, samhit, s, tantra, sanskrit, literally, means, loom, warp, weave, according, to, padoux, the, verbal, root, tan, means, to, extend, to, spread, to, spin, out, weave, display, put, forth, and, compose, therefore, by, extension, it, can, also, mean, system, doctrine, or, work, some, scholars, argue, that, the, connotation, of, the, word, tantra, to, mean, an, esoteric, practice, or, religious, ritualism, is, a, colonial, era, european, invention, this, term, is, based, on, the, metaphor, of, weaving, states, ron, barrett, where, the, sanskrit, root, tan, means, the, warping, of, threads, on, a, loom, it, implies, interweaving, of, traditions, and, teachings, as, threads, into, a, text, technique, or, practice, the, word, appears, in, the, hymns, of, the, rigveda, such, as, in, 10, 71, with, the, meaning, of, warp, weaving, it, is, found, in, many, other, vedic, era, texts, such, as, in, section, 10, 7, 42, of, the, atharvaveda, and, many, brahmanas, in, these, and, post, vedic, texts, the, contextual, meaning, of, tantra, is, that, which, is, principal, or, essential, part, main, point, model, framework, feature, in, the, smritis, and, epics, of, hinduism, and, jainism, the, term, means, doctrine, rule, theory, method, technique, or, chapter, and, the, word, appears, both, as, a, separate, word, and, as, a, common, suffix, such, as, atma, tantra, meaning, doctrine, or, theory, of, atman, self, the, term, tantra, after, about, 500, bce, in, buddhism, hinduism, and, jainism, is, a, bibliographic, category, just, like, the, word, sutra, which, means, sewing, together, mirroring, the, metaphor, of, weaving, together, in, tantra, the, same, buddhist, texts, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, tantra, or, sutra, for, example, vairocabhisambodhi, tantra, is, also, referred, to, as, vairocabhisambodhi, sutra, the, various, contextual, meanings, of, the, word, tantra, vary, with, the, indian, text, and, are, summarized, in, the, appended, table, the, 5th, century, bce, scholar, p, ini, in, his, sutra, 1, 4, 54, 55, of, sanskrit, grammar, cryptically, explains, tantra, through, the, example, of, sva, tantra, sanskrit, which, he, states, means, independent, or, a, person, who, is, his, own, warp, cloth, weaver, promoter, karta, actor, patanjali, in, his, mah, bh, ya, quotes, and, accepts, panini, s, definition, then, discusses, or, mentions, it, at, a, greater, length, in, 18, instances, stating, that, its, metaphorical, definition, of, warp, weaving, extended, cloth, is, relevant, to, many, contexts, the, word, tantra, states, patanjali, means, principal, main, he, uses, the, same, example, of, svatantra, as, a, composite, word, of, sva, self, and, tantra, then, stating, svatantra, means, one, who, is, self, dependent, one, who, is, his, own, master, the, principal, thing, for, whom, is, himself, thereby, interpreting, the, definition, of, tantra, patanjali, also, offers, a, semantic, definition, of, tantra, stating, that, it, is, structural, rules, standard, procedures, centralized, guide, or, knowledge, in, any, field, that, applies, to, many, elements, starting, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, newly, revealed, tantras, centering, on, vishnu, shiva, or, shakti, emerged, there, are, tantric, lineages, in, all, main, forms, of, modern, hinduism, such, as, the, shaiva, siddhanta, tradition, the, shakta, sect, of, shri, vidya, the, kaula, and, kashmir, shaivism, the, ancient, mimamsa, school, of, hinduism, uses, the, term, tantra, extensively, and, its, scholars, offer, various, definitions, for, example, when, an, action, or, a, thing, once, complete, becomes, beneficial, in, several, matters, to, one, person, or, to, many, people, that, is, known, as, tantra, for, example, a, lamp, placed, amidst, many, priests, in, contrast, that, which, benefits, by, its, repetition, is, called, v, pa, such, as, massaging, with, oil, medieval, texts, present, their, own, definitions, of, tantra, k, mik, tantra, for, example, gives, the, following, explanation, of, the, term, tantra, because, it, elaborates, tan, copious, and, profound, matters, especially, relating, to, the, principles, of, reality, tattva, and, sacred, mantras, and, because, it, provides, liberation, tra, it, is, called, a, tantra, the, occultist, and, businessman, pierre, bernard, 1875, 1955, is, widely, credited, with, introducing, the, philosophy, and, practices, of, tantra, to, the, american, people, at, the, same, time, creating, a, somewhat, misleading, impression, of, its, connection, to, sex, that, popular, sexualization, is, more, accurately, regarded, as, the, western, neo, tantra, movement, in, modern, scholarship, tantra, has, been, studied, as, an, esoteric, practice, and, ritualistic, religion, sometimes, referred, to, as, tantrism, there, is, a, wide, gap, between, what, tantra, means, to, its, followers, and, the, way, tantra, has, been, represented, or, perceived, since, colonial, era, writers, began, commenting, on, it, many, definitions, of, tantra, have, been, proposed, since, and, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, andr, padoux, in, his, review, of, tantra, definitions, offers, two, then, rejects, both, one, definition, according, to, padoux, is, found, among, tantra, practitioners, it, is, any, system, of, observances, about, the, vision, of, man, and, the, cosmos, where, correspondences, between, the, inner, world, of, the, person, and, the, macrocosmic, reality, play, an, essential, role, another, definition, more, common, among, observers, and, non, practitioners, is, some, set, of, mechanistic, rituals, omitting, entirely, the, ideological, side, tantric, traditions, have, been, studied, mostly, from, textual, and, historical, perspectives, anthropological, work, on, living, tantric, tradition, is, scarce, and, ethnography, has, rarely, engaged, with, the, study, of, tantra, this, is, arguably, a, result, of, the, modern, construction, of, tantrism, as, occult, esoteric, and, secret, some, scholars, have, tried, to, demystify, the, myth, of, secrecy, in, contemporary, tantric, traditions, suggesting, new, methodological, avenues, to, overcome, the, ethical, and, epistemological, problems, in, the, study, of, living, tantric, traditions, according, to, david, n, lorenzen, two, different, kinds, of, definitions, of, tantra, exist, narrow, and, broad, according, to, the, narrow, definition, tantrism, or, tantric, religion, is, the, elite, traditions, directly, based, on, the, sanskrit, texts, called, the, tantras, samhitas, and, agamas, lorenzen, s, broad, definition, extends, this, by, including, a, broad, range, of, magical, beliefs, and, practices, such, as, yoga, and, shaktism, the, term, yoga, is, broadly, attributed, to, many, traditions, and, practices, including, the, western, assumption, that, yoga, is, synonymous, with, physical, stretching, and, little, more, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, define, yoga, as, the, stilling, of, the, disturbances, of, the, mind, richard, payne, states, that, tantra, has, been, commonly, but, incorrectly, associated, with, sex, given, popular, culture, s, prurient, obsession, with, intimacy, tantra, has, been, labelled, as, the, yoga, of, ecstasy, driven, by, senseless, ritualistic, libertinism, this, is, far, from, the, diverse, and, complex, understanding, of, what, tantra, means, to, those, buddhists, hindu, and, jains, who, practice, it, david, gray, disagrees, with, broad, generalizations, and, states, that, defining, tantra, is, a, difficult, task, because, tantra, traditions, are, manifold, spanning, several, religious, traditions, and, cultural, worlds, as, a, result, they, are, also, diverse, which, makes, it, a, significant, challenge, to, come, up, with, an, adequate, definition, the, challenge, of, defining, tantra, is, compounded, by, the, fact, that, it, has, been, a, historically, significant, part, of, major, indian, religions, including, buddhism, hinduism, and, jainism, both, in, and, outside, south, asia, and, east, asia, to, its, practitioners, tantra, is, defined, as, a, combination, of, texts, techniques, rituals, monastic, practices, meditation, yoga, and, ideology, according, to, georg, feuerstein, the, scope, of, topics, discussed, in, the, tantras, is, considerable, they, deal, with, the, creation, and, history, of, the, world, the, names, and, functions, of, a, great, variety, of, male, and, female, deities, and, other, higher, beings, the, types, of, ritual, worship, especially, of, goddesses, magic, sorcery, and, divination, esoteric, physiology, the, mapping, of, the, subtle, or, psychic, body, the, awakening, of, the, mysterious, serpent, power, kundalin, shakti, techniques, of, bodily, and, mental, purification, the, nature, of, enlightenment, and, not, least, sacred, sexuality, hindu, puja, temples, and, iconography, all, show, tantric, influence, these, texts, states, gavin, flood, contain, representation, of, the, body, in, philosophy, in, ritual, and, in, art, which, are, linked, to, techniques, of, the, body, methods, or, technologies, developed, within, the, tantric, traditions, intended, to, transform, body, and, self, the, term, tantrism, is, a, 19th, century, european, invention, not, present, in, any, asian, language, compare, sufism, of, similar, orientalist, origin, according, to, padoux, tantrism, is, a, western, term, and, notion, not, a, category, that, is, used, by, tantrikas, themselves, the, term, was, introduced, by, 19th, century, indologists, with, limited, knowledge, of, india, and, in, whose, view, tantrism, was, a, particular, unusual, and, minority, practice, in, contrast, to, indian, traditions, they, believed, to, be, mainstream, robert, brown, similarly, notes, that, tantrism, is, a, construct, of, western, scholarship, not, a, concept, of, the, religious, system, itself, he, defines, tantrism, as, an, apologetic, label, of, westerners, for, a, system, that, they, little, understand, that, is, not, coherent, and, which, is, an, accumulated, set, of, practices, and, ideas, from, various, sources, that, has, varied, between, its, practitioners, within, a, group, varied, across, groups, across, geography, and, over, its, history, it, is, a, system, adds, brown, that, gives, each, follower, the, freedom, to, mix, tantric, elements, with, non, tantric, aspects, to, challenge, and, transgress, any, and, all, norms, experiment, with, the, mundane, to, reach, the, supramundane, teun, goudriaan, in, his, 1981, review, of, hindu, tantrism, states, that, tantrism, usually, means, a, systematic, quest, for, salvation, or, spiritual, excellence, by, realizing, and, fostering, the, divine, within, one, s, own, body, one, that, is, simultaneous, union, of, the, masculine, feminine, and, spirit, matter, and, has, the, ultimate, goal, of, realizing, the, primal, blissful, state, of, non, duality, it, is, typically, a, methodically, striven, system, consisting, of, voluntarily, chosen, specific, practices, which, may, include, tantric, items, such, as, mantras, bijas, geometric, patterns, and, symbols, mandala, gestures, mudra, mapping, of, the, microcosm, within, one, s, body, to, the, macrocosmic, elements, outside, as, the, subtle, body, kundalini, yoga, assignments, of, icons, and, sounds, nyasa, meditation, dhyana, ritual, worship, puja, initiation, diksha, and, others, tantrism, adds, goudriaan, is, a, living, system, that, is, decidedly, monistic, but, with, wide, variations, and, it, is, impossible, to, be, dogmatic, about, a, simple, or, fixed, definition, tantrism, is, an, overarching, term, for, tantric, traditions, states, david, gray, in, a, 2016, review, that, combine, vedic, yogic, and, meditative, traditions, from, ancient, hinduism, as, well, as, rival, buddhist, and, jain, traditions, it, is, a, neologism, of, western, scholars, and, does, not, reflect, the, self, understanding, of, any, particular, tantric, tradition, while, goudriaan, s, description, is, useful, adds, gray, there, is, no, single, defining, universal, characteristic, common, to, all, tantra, traditions, being, an, open, evolving, system, tantrism, whether, buddhist, or, hindu, can, best, be, characterized, as, practices, a, set, of, techniques, with, a, strong, focus, on, rituals, and, meditation, by, those, who, believe, that, it, is, a, path, to, liberation, that, is, characterized, by, both, knowledge, and, freedom, according, to, padoux, the, term, tantrika, is, based, on, a, comment, by, kulluka, bhatta, on, manava, dharmasastra, 2, 1, who, contrasted, vaidika, and, tantrika, forms, of, sruti, canonical, texts, the, tantrika, to, bhatta, is, that, literature, which, forms, a, parallel, part, of, the, hindu, tradition, independent, of, the, vedic, corpus, the, vedic, and, non, vedic, tantric, paths, are, seen, as, two, different, approaches, to, ultimate, reality, the, vedic, approach, based, on, brahman, and, tantrika, being, based, on, the, non, vedic, gama, texts, despite, bhatta, attempt, to, clarify, states, padoux, in, reality, hindus, and, buddhists, have, historically, felt, free, to, borrow, and, blend, ideas, from, all, sources, vedic, non, vedic, and, in, the, case, of, buddhism, its, own, canonical, works, one, of, the, key, differences, between, the, tantric, and, non, tantric, traditions, whether, it, be, orthodox, buddhism, hinduism, or, jainism, is, their, assumptions, about, the, need, for, monastic, or, ascetic, life, non, tantrika, or, orthodox, traditions, in, all, three, major, ancient, indian, religions, hold, that, the, worldly, life, of, a, householder, is, one, driven, by, desires, and, greeds, which, are, a, serious, impediment, to, spiritual, liberation, moksha, nirvana, kaivalya, these, orthodox, traditions, teach, renunciation, of, householder, life, a, mendicant, s, life, of, simplicity, and, leaving, all, attachments, to, become, a, monk, or, nun, in, contrast, the, tantrika, traditions, hold, states, robert, brown, that, both, enlightenment, and, worldly, success, are, achievable, and, that, this, world, need, not, be, shunned, to, achieve, enlightenment, yet, even, this, supposed, categorical, divergence, is, debatable, e, g, bhagavad, gita, v, 2, 48, 53, including, yoga, is, skill, in, actions, the, ke, in, hymn, of, the, rig, veda, 10, 136, describes, the, wild, loner, who, states, karel, werner, carrying, within, oneself, fire, and, poison, heaven, and, earth, ranging, from, enthusiasm, and, creativity, to, depression, and, agony, from, the, heights, of, spiritual, bliss, to, the, heaviness, of, earth, bound, labor, the, rigveda, uses, words, of, admiration, for, these, loners, and, whether, it, is, related, to, tantra, or, not, has, been, variously, interpreted, according, to, david, lorenzen, it, describes, munis, sages, experiencing, tantra, like, ecstatic, altered, states, of, consciousness, and, gaining, the, ability, to, fly, on, the, wind, in, contrast, werner, suggests, that, these, are, early, yoga, pioneers, and, accomplished, yogis, of, the, ancient, pre, buddhist, indian, tradition, and, that, this, vedic, hymn, is, speaking, of, those, lost, in, thoughts, whose, personalities, are, not, bound, to, earth, for, they, follow, the, path, of, the, mysterious, wind, the, two, oldest, upanishadic, scriptures, of, hinduism, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, in, section, 4, 2, and, chandogya, upanishad, in, section, 8, 6, refer, to, nadis, hati, in, presenting, their, theory, on, how, the, atman, self, and, the, body, are, connected, and, interdependent, through, energy, carrying, arteries, when, one, is, awake, or, sleeping, but, they, do, not, mention, anything, related, to, tantric, practices, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, describes, breath, control, that, became, a, standard, part, of, yoga, but, tantric, practices, do, not, appear, in, it, likewise, the, taittiriya, upanishad, discusses, a, central, channel, running, through, the, body, and, various, vedic, texts, mention, the, bodily, pranas, vital, breaths, that, move, around, in, the, body, and, animate, it, however, the, idea, of, consciously, moving, the, bodily, pranas, through, yoga, is, not, found, in, these, sources, according, to, lorenzen, vedic, ideas, related, to, the, body, later, diversified, into, the, mystical, anatomy, of, nadis, and, chakras, found, in, tantra, the, yogic, component, of, tantrism, appears, clearly, in, b, abha, a, s, harshacharita, and, da, in, s, dashakumaracharita, in, contrast, to, this, theory, of, lorenzen, other, scholars, such, as, mircea, eliade, consider, yoga, and, the, evolution, of, yogic, practices, to, be, separate, and, distinct, from, the, evolution, of, tantra, and, tantric, practices, according, to, geoffrey, samuel, the, inner, development, of, a, spiritual, energy, called, tapas, becomes, a, central, element, of, vedic, religion, in, the, brahmanas, and, srauta, texts, in, these, texts, ascetic, practices, allow, a, holy, man, to, build, up, tapas, a, kind, of, magical, inner, heat, which, allows, them, to, perform, all, sorts, of, magical, feats, as, well, as, granting, visions, and, divine, revelations, samuel, also, notes, that, in, the, mahabharata, one, of, the, commonest, use, of, the, term, yoga, refers, to, a, dying, warrior, transferring, himself, at, death, to, the, sphere, of, the, sun, through, yoga, a, practice, that, links, up, with, upanisadic, references, to, the, channel, to, the, crown, of, the, head, as, the, pathway, by, which, one, can, travel, through, the, solar, orb, to, the, world, of, brahman, this, practice, of, transferring, one, s, consciousness, at, death, is, still, an, important, practice, in, tibetan, buddhism, samuel, also, notes, that, sexual, rituals, and, a, spiritualized, sexuality, are, mentioned, in, the, late, upanishads, according, to, samuel, late, vedic, texts, treat, sexual, intercourse, as, symbolically, equivalent, to, the, vedic, sacrifice, and, ejaculation, of, semen, as, the, offering, this, theme, can, be, found, in, the, jaiminiya, brahmana, the, chandogya, upanisad, and, the, brhadaranyaka, upanisad, the, brhadaranyaka, contains, various, sexual, rituals, and, practices, which, are, mostly, aimed, at, obtaining, a, child, which, are, concerned, with, the, loss, of, male, virility, and, power, david, gordon, white, views, yogini, cults, as, foundational, to, early, tantra, but, disagrees, with, scholars, who, maintain, that, the, roots, of, such, cults, lie, in, an, autochthonous, non, vedic, source, such, as, indigenous, tribes, or, the, indus, valley, civilization, instead, white, suggests, vedic, srauta, texts, mention, offerings, to, goddesses, r, k, sin, v, l, and, kuh, in, a, manner, similar, to, a, tantric, ritual, frederick, smith, a, professor, of, sanskrit, and, classical, indian, religions, considers, tantra, to, be, a, religious, movement, parallel, to, the, bhakti, movement, of, the, 1st, millennium, ad, tantra, along, with, ayurveda, states, smith, has, traditionally, been, attributed, to, atharvaveda, but, this, attribution, is, one, of, respect, not, of, historicity, ayurveda, has, primarily, been, an, empirical, practice, with, vedic, roots, but, tantra, has, been, an, esoteric, folk, movement, without, grounding, that, can, be, traced, to, anything, in, atharvaveda, or, any, other, vedic, text, pre, tantric, buddhism, contains, elements, which, could, be, seen, as, proto, tantric, and, which, may, have, influenced, the, development, of, the, buddhist, tantric, tradition, the, use, of, magical, chants, or, incantations, can, be, found, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, as, well, as, in, some, mahayana, sutras, these, magical, spells, or, chants, were, used, for, various, reasons, such, as, for, protection, and, for, the, generation, of, auspiciousness, mahayana, incantations, are, called, dh, ra, s, some, mahayana, sutras, incorporate, the, use, of, mantras, a, central, feature, of, tantric, practice, according, to, geoffrey, samuel, sramana, groups, like, the, buddhists, and, jains, were, associated, with, the, dead, samuel, notes, that, they, frequently, settled, at, sites, associated, with, the, dead, and, seem, to, have, taken, over, a, significant, role, in, relation, to, the, spirits, of, the, dead, to, step, into, this, realm, required, entering, a, dangerous, and, impure, supernatural, realm, from, the, indian, perspective, this, association, with, death, remains, a, feature, of, modern, buddhism, and, in, buddhist, countries, today, buddhist, monks, and, other, ritual, specialists, are, in, charge, of, the, dead, thus, the, association, of, tantric, practitioners, with, charnel, grounds, and, death, imagery, is, preceded, by, early, buddhist, contact, with, these, sites, of, the, dead, some, scholars, think, that, the, development, of, tantra, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, cults, of, nature, spirit, deities, like, yak, as, and, nagas, yak, a, cults, were, an, important, part, of, early, buddhism, yak, as, are, powerful, nature, spirits, which, were, sometimes, seen, as, guardians, or, protectors, yak, as, like, kubera, are, also, associated, with, magical, incantations, kubera, is, said, to, have, provided, the, buddhist, sangha, with, protection, spells, in, the, n, iya, sutta, these, spirit, deities, also, included, numerous, female, deities, yak, i, that, can, be, found, depicted, in, major, buddhist, sites, like, sanchi, and, bharhut, in, early, buddhist, texts, there, is, also, mention, of, fierce, demon, like, deities, called, r, k, asa, and, r, k, as, like, the, children, eating, h, r, t, they, are, also, present, in, mahayana, texts, such, as, in, chapter, 26, of, the, lotus, sutra, which, includes, a, dialogue, between, the, buddha, and, a, group, of, r, k, as, s, who, swear, to, uphold, and, protect, the, sutra, these, figures, also, teach, magical, dh, ra, s, to, protect, followers, of, the, lotus, sutra, a, key, element, of, buddhist, tantric, practice, is, the, visualization, of, deities, in, meditation, this, practice, is, actually, found, in, pre, tantric, buddhist, texts, as, well, in, mahayana, sutras, like, the, pratyutpanna, sam, dhi, and, the, three, amitabha, pure, land, sutras, there, are, other, mah, y, na, sutras, which, contain, what, may, be, called, proto, tantric, material, such, as, the, gandavyuha, and, the, dasabhumika, which, might, have, served, as, a, source, for, the, imagery, found, in, later, tantric, texts, according, to, samuel, the, golden, light, sutra, c, 5th, century, at, the, latest, contains, what, could, be, seen, as, a, proto, mandala, in, the, second, chapter, a, bodhisattva, has, a, vision, of, a, vast, building, made, of, beryl, and, with, divine, jewels, and, celestial, perfumes, four, lotus, seats, appear, in, the, four, directions, with, four, buddhas, seated, upon, them, aksobhya, in, the, east, ratnaketu, in, the, south, amitayus, in, the, west, and, dundubh, vara, in, the, north, a, series, of, artwork, discovered, in, gandhara, in, modern, day, pakistan, dating, from, about, the, 1st, century, ce, show, buddhist, and, hindu, monks, holding, skulls, the, legend, corresponding, to, these, artworks, is, found, in, buddhist, texts, and, describes, monks, who, tap, skulls, and, forecast, the, future, rebirths, of, the, person, to, whom, that, skull, belonged, according, to, robert, brown, these, buddhist, skull, tapping, reliefs, suggest, that, tantric, practices, may, have, been, in, vogue, by, the, 1st, century, ce, the, mahabharata, the, harivamsa, and, the, devi, mahatmya, in, the, markandeya, purana, all, mention, the, fierce, demon, killing, manifestations, of, the, great, goddess, mahishamardini, identified, with, durga, parvati, these, suggest, that, shaktism, reverence, and, worship, for, the, goddess, in, indian, culture, was, an, established, tradition, by, the, early, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, padoux, mentions, an, inscription, from, 423, to, 424, ce, which, mentions, the, founding, of, a, temple, to, terrifying, deities, called, the, mothers, however, this, does, not, mean, tantric, rituals, and, practices, were, as, yet, a, part, of, either, hindu, or, buddhist, traditions, apart, from, the, somewhat, dubious, reference, to, tantra, in, the, gangadhar, inscription, of, 423, ce, states, david, lorenzen, it, is, only, 7th, century, banabhatta, s, kadambari, which, provide, convincing, proof, of, tantra, and, tantric, texts, shaivite, ascetics, seem, to, have, been, involved, in, the, initial, development, of, tantra, particularly, the, transgressive, elements, dealing, with, the, charnel, ground, according, to, samuel, one, group, of, shaiva, ascetics, the, pasupatas, practiced, a, form, of, spirituality, that, made, use, of, shocking, and, disreputable, behavior, later, found, in, a, tantric, context, such, as, dancing, singing, and, smearing, themselves, with, ashes, early, tantric, practices, are, sometimes, attributed, to, shaiva, ascetics, associated, with, bhairava, the, kapalikas, skull, men, also, called, somasiddhatins, or, mahavartins, besides, the, shocking, fact, that, they, frequented, cremation, grounds, and, carried, human, skulls, little, is, known, about, them, and, there, is, a, paucity, of, primary, sources, on, the, kapalikas, samuel, also, states, that, the, sources, depict, them, as, using, alcohol, and, sex, freely, that, they, were, associated, with, terrfying, female, spirit, deities, called, yoginis, and, dakinis, and, that, they, were, believed, to, possess, magical, powers, such, as, flight, kapalikas, are, depicted, in, fictional, works, and, also, widely, disparaged, in, buddhist, hindu, and, jain, texts, of, the, 1st, millennium, ce, in, h, la, s, gatha, saptasati, composed, by, the, 5th, century, ad, for, example, the, story, calls, a, female, character, kapalika, whose, lover, dies, he, is, cremated, she, takes, his, cremation, ashes, and, smears, her, body, with, it, the, 6th, century, var, hamihira, mentions, kapalikas, in, his, literary, works, some, of, the, k, p, lika, practices, mentioned, in, these, texts, are, those, found, in, shaiva, hinduism, and, vajrayana, buddhism, and, scholars, disagree, on, who, influenced, whom, these, early, historical, mentions, are, in, passing, and, appear, to, be, tantra, like, practices, they, are, not, detailed, nor, comprehensive, presentation, of, tantric, beliefs, and, practices, epigraphic, references, to, the, kaulas, tantric, practices, are, rare, reference, is, made, in, the, early, 9th, century, to, vama, left, hand, tantras, of, the, kaulas, literary, evidence, suggests, tantric, buddhism, was, probably, flourishing, by, the, 7th, century, matrikas, or, fierce, mother, goddesses, that, later, are, closely, linked, to, tantra, practices, appear, both, in, buddhist, and, hindu, arts, and, literature, between, the, 7th, and, 10th, centuries, according, to, gavin, flood, the, earliest, date, for, the, tantra, texts, related, to, tantric, practices, is, 600, ce, though, most, of, them, were, probably, composed, after, the, 8th, century, onwards, according, to, flood, very, little, is, known, about, who, created, the, tantras, nor, much, is, known, about, the, social, status, of, these, and, medieval, era, tantrikas, flood, states, that, the, pioneers, of, tantra, may, have, been, ascetics, who, lived, at, the, cremation, grounds, possibly, from, above, low, caste, groups, and, were, probably, non, brahmanical, and, possibly, part, of, an, ancient, tradition, by, the, early, medieval, times, their, practices, may, have, included, the, imitation, of, deities, such, as, kali, and, bhairava, with, offerings, of, non, vegetarian, food, alcohol, and, sexual, substances, according, to, this, theory, these, practitioners, would, have, invited, their, deities, to, enter, them, then, reverted, the, role, in, order, to, control, that, deity, and, gain, its, power, these, ascetics, would, have, been, supported, by, low, castes, living, at, the, cremation, places, samuel, states, that, transgressive, and, antinomian, tantric, practices, developed, in, both, buddhist, and, brahmanical, mainly, aiva, ascetics, like, the, kapalikas, contexts, and, that, aivas, and, buddhists, borrowed, extensively, from, each, other, with, varying, degrees, of, acknowledgement, according, to, samuel, these, deliberately, transgressive, practices, included, night, time, orgies, in, charnel, grounds, involving, the, eating, of, human, flesh, the, use, of, ornaments, bowls, and, musical, instruments, made, from, human, bones, sexual, relations, while, seated, on, corpses, and, the, like, according, to, samuel, another, key, element, of, in, the, development, of, tantra, was, the, gradual, transformation, of, local, and, regional, deity, cults, through, which, fierce, male, and, particularly, female, deities, came, to, take, a, leading, role, in, the, place, of, the, yaksa, deities, samuel, states, that, this, took, place, between, the, fifth, to, eighth, centuries, ce, according, to, samuel, there, are, two, main, scholarly, opinions, on, these, terrifying, goddesses, which, became, incorporated, into, aiva, and, buddhist, tantra, the, first, view, is, that, they, originate, out, of, a, pan, indian, religious, substrate, that, was, not, vedic, another, opinion, is, to, see, these, fierce, goddesses, as, developing, out, of, the, vedic, religion, alexis, sanderson, has, argued, that, tantric, practices, originally, developed, in, a, aiva, milieu, and, was, later, adopted, by, buddhists, he, cites, numerous, elements, that, are, found, in, the, aiva, vidyapitha, literature, including, whole, passages, and, lists, of, pithas, that, seem, to, have, been, directly, borrowed, by, vajrayana, texts, this, has, been, criticized, by, ronald, m, davidson, however, due, to, the, uncertain, date, of, the, vidyapitha, texts, davidson, argues, that, the, pithas, seem, to, have, been, neither, uniquely, buddhist, nor, aiva, but, frequented, by, both, groups, he, also, states, that, the, aiva, tradition, was, also, involved, in, the, appropriation, of, local, deities, and, that, tantra, may, have, been, influenced, by, tribal, indian, religions, and, their, deities, samuel, writes, that, the, female, divinities, may, well, best, be, understood, in, terms, of, a, distinct, kta, milieu, from, which, both, aivas, and, buddhists, were, borrowing, but, that, other, elements, like, the, kapalika, style, practices, are, more, clearly, derived, from, a, aiva, tradition, samuel, writes, that, the, saiva, tantra, tradition, appears, to, have, originated, as, ritual, sorcery, carried, out, by, hereditary, caste, groups, kulas, and, associated, with, sex, death, and, fierce, goddesses, the, initiation, rituals, involved, the, consumption, of, the, mixed, sexual, secretions, the, clan, essence, of, a, male, guru, and, his, consort, these, practices, were, adopted, by, kapalika, styled, ascetics, and, influenced, the, early, nath, siddhas, over, time, the, more, extreme, external, elements, were, replaced, by, internalized, yogas, that, make, use, of, the, subtle, body, sexual, ritual, became, a, way, to, reach, the, liberating, wisdom, taught, in, the, tradition, the, buddhists, developed, their, own, corpus, of, tantras, which, also, drew, on, various, mahayana, doctrines, and, practices, as, well, as, on, elements, of, the, fierce, goddess, tradition, and, also, on, elements, from, the, aiva, traditions, such, as, deities, like, bhairava, which, were, seen, as, having, been, subjugated, and, converted, to, buddhism, some, buddhist, tantras, sometimes, called, lower, or, outer, tantras, which, are, earlier, works, do, not, make, use, of, transgression, sex, and, fierce, deities, these, earlier, buddhist, tantras, mainly, reflect, a, development, of, mahayana, theory, and, practice, like, deity, visualization, and, a, focus, on, ritual, and, purity, between, the, eighth, and, tenth, centuries, new, tantras, emerged, which, included, fierce, deities, kula, style, sexual, initiations, subtle, body, practices, and, sexual, yoga, the, later, buddhist, tantras, are, known, as, the, inner, or, unsurpassed, yoga, anuttarayoga, or, yogini, tantras, according, to, samuel, it, seems, that, these, sexual, practices, were, not, initially, practiced, by, buddhist, monastics, and, instead, developed, outside, of, the, monastic, establishments, among, traveling, siddhas, tantric, practices, also, included, secret, initiation, ceremonies, in, which, individuals, would, enter, the, tantric, family, kula, and, receive, the, secret, mantras, of, the, tantric, deities, these, initiations, included, the, consumption, of, the, sexual, substances, semen, and, female, sexual, secretions, produced, through, ritual, sex, between, the, guru, and, his, consort, these, substances, were, seen, as, spiritually, powerful, and, were, also, used, as, offerings, for, tantric, deities, for, both, aivas, and, buddhists, tantric, practices, often, took, place, at, important, sacred, sites, pithas, associated, with, fierce, goddesses, samuel, writes, that, we, do, not, have, a, clear, picture, of, how, this, network, of, pilgrimage, sites, arose, whatever, the, case, it, seems, that, it, was, in, these, ritual, spaces, visited, by, both, buddhists, and, aivas, that, the, practice, of, kaula, and, anuttarayoga, tantra, developed, during, the, eighth, and, ninth, centuries, besides, the, practices, outlined, above, these, sites, also, saw, the, practice, of, animal, sacrifice, as, blood, offerings, to, kta, goddesses, like, kamakhya, this, practice, is, mentioned, in, kta, texts, like, the, k, lik, pur, a, and, the, yogin, tantra, in, some, of, these, sites, such, as, kamakhya, pitha, animal, sacrifice, is, still, widely, practiced, by, ktas, another, key, and, innovative, feature, of, medieval, tantric, systems, was, the, development, of, internal, yogas, based, on, elements, of, the, subtle, body, s, k, ma, ar, ra, this, subtle, anatomy, held, that, there, were, channels, in, the, body, nadis, through, which, certain, substances, or, energies, such, as, vayu, prana, kundalini, and, shakti, flowed, these, yogas, involved, moving, these, energies, through, the, body, to, clear, out, certain, knots, or, blockages, granthi, and, to, direct, the, energies, to, the, central, channel, avadhuti, sushumna, these, yogic, practices, are, also, closely, related, to, the, practice, of, sexual, yoga, since, sexual, intercourse, was, seen, as, being, involved, in, the, stimulation, of, the, flow, of, these, energies, samuel, thinks, that, these, subtle, body, practices, may, have, been, influenced, by, chinese, daoist, practices, one, of, the, earliest, mentions, of, sexual, yoga, practice, is, in, the, buddhist, mah, y, nas, tr, lamk, ra, of, asanga, c, 5th, century, which, states, supreme, self, control, is, achieved, in, the, reversal, of, sexual, intercourse, in, the, blissful, buddha, poise, and, the, untrammelled, vision, of, one, s, spouse, according, to, david, snellgrove, the, text, s, mention, of, a, reversal, of, sexual, intercourse, might, indicate, the, practice, of, withholding, ejaculation, snellgrove, states, that, it, is, possible, that, sexual, yoga, was, already, being, practiced, in, buddhist, circles, at, this, time, and, that, asanga, saw, it, as, a, valid, practice, likewise, samuel, thinks, that, there, is, a, possibility, that, sexual, yoga, existed, in, the, fourth, or, fifth, centuries, though, not, in, the, same, transgressive, tantric, contexts, where, it, was, later, practiced, it, is, only, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, however, that, we, find, substantial, evidence, for, these, sexual, yogas, unlike, previous, upanishadic, sexual, rituals, however, which, seem, to, have, been, associated, with, vedic, sacrifice, and, mundane, ends, like, childbirth, these, sexual, yogas, were, associated, with, the, movement, of, subtle, body, energies, like, kundalini, and, chandali, which, were, also, seen, as, goddesses, and, also, with, spiritual, ends, these, practices, seemed, to, have, developed, at, around, the, same, time, in, both, saiva, and, buddhist, circles, and, are, associated, with, figures, such, as, tirum, lar, gorakhnath, virupa, naropa, the, tantric, mahasiddhas, developed, yogic, systems, with, subtle, body, and, sexual, elements, which, could, lead, to, magical, powers, siddhis, immortality, as, well, as, spiritual, liberation, moksha, nirvana, sexual, yoga, was, seen, as, one, way, of, producing, a, blissful, expansion, of, consciousness, that, could, lead, to, liberation, according, to, jacob, dalton, ritualized, sexual, yoga, along, with, the, sexual, elements, of, the, tantric, initiation, ritual, like, the, consumption, of, sexual, fluids, first, appears, in, buddhist, works, called, mahayoga, tantras, which, include, the, guhyagarbha, and, guhyasamaja, these, texts, focused, on, the, body, s, interior, on, the, anatomical, details, of, the, male, and, female, sexual, organs, and, the, pleasure, generated, through, sexual, union, in, these, texts, sexual, energy, was, also, seen, as, a, powerful, force, that, could, be, harnessed, for, spiritual, practice, and, according, to, samuel, perhaps, create, the, state, of, bliss, and, loss, of, personal, identity, which, is, homologised, with, liberating, insight, these, sexual, yogas, continued, to, develop, further, into, more, complex, systems, which, are, found, in, texts, dating, from, about, the, ninth, or, tenth, century, including, the, saiva, kaulaj, nanir, aya, and, kubjik, tantra, as, well, as, the, buddhist, hevajra, and, cakrasamvara, tantras, which, make, use, of, charnel, ground, symbolism, and, fierce, goddesses, samuel, writes, that, these, later, texts, also, combine, the, sexual, yoga, with, a, system, of, controlling, the, energies, of, the, subtle, body, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, the, hevajra, and, cakrasamvara, tantras, borrow, significant, portions, from, saiva, sources, the, text, cakrasamvara, and, its, commentaries, have, revealed, numerous, attempts, by, the, buddhists, to, enlarge, and, modify, it, both, to, remove, references, to, saiva, deities, and, to, add, more, buddhist, technical, terminology, from, the, 8th, to, the, 14th, century, tantric, traditions, rose, to, prominence, and, flourished, throughout, india, and, beyond, by, the, 10th, century, the, main, elements, of, tantric, practice, had, reached, maturity, and, were, being, practiced, in, saiva, and, buddhist, contexts, this, period, has, been, referred, to, as, the, tantric, age, by, some, scholars, due, to, prevalence, of, tantra, also, by, the, 10th, century, numerous, tantric, texts, variously, called, agamas, samhitas, and, tantras, had, been, written, particularly, in, kashmir, nepal, and, bengal, by, this, time, tantric, texts, had, also, been, translated, into, regional, languages, such, as, tamil, and, tantric, practices, had, spread, across, south, asia, tantra, also, spread, into, tibet, indonesia, and, china, gavin, flood, describes, the, tantric, age, as, follows, tantrism, has, been, so, pervasive, that, all, of, hinduism, after, the, eleventh, century, perhaps, with, the, exception, of, the, vedic, srauta, tradition, is, influenced, by, it, all, forms, of, saiva, vaisnava, and, smarta, religion, even, those, forms, which, wanted, to, distance, themselves, from, tantrism, absorbed, elements, derived, from, the, tantras, though, the, whole, northern, and, himalayan, part, of, india, was, involved, in, the, development, of, tantra, kashmir, was, a, particularly, important, center, both, saiva, and, buddhist, and, numerous, key, tantric, texts, were, written, there, according, to, padoux, according, to, alexis, sanderson, the, aiva, tantra, traditions, of, medieval, kashmir, were, mainly, divided, between, the, dualistic, aiva, siddhanta, and, the, non, dualist, theology, found, in, akta, lineages, like, the, trika, krama, and, kaula, the, non, dualists, generally, accepted, and, made, use, of, sexual, and, transgressive, practices, while, the, dualists, mostly, rejected, them, saiva, tantra, was, especially, successful, because, it, managed, to, forge, strong, ties, with, south, asian, kings, who, valued, the, power, shakti, of, fierce, deities, like, the, warrior, goddess, durga, as, a, way, to, increase, their, own, royal, power, these, kings, took, part, in, royal, rituals, led, by, saiva, royal, gurus, in, which, they, were, symbolically, married, to, tantric, deities, and, thus, became, the, earthly, representative, of, male, gods, like, shiva, saiva, tantra, could, also, employ, a, variety, of, protection, and, destruction, rituals, which, could, be, used, for, the, benefit, of, the, kingdom, and, the, king, tantric, shaivism, was, adopted, by, the, kings, of, kashmir, as, well, as, by, the, somavamshis, of, odisha, the, kalachuris, and, the, chandelas, of, jejakabhukti, in, bundelkhand, there, is, also, evidence, of, state, support, from, the, cambodian, khmer, empire, as, noted, by, samuel, in, spite, of, the, increased, depiction, of, female, goddesses, these, tantric, traditions, all, seemed, to, have, been, mostly, male, directed, and, male, controlled, during, the, tantric, age, buddhist, tantra, was, embraced, by, the, mahayana, buddhist, mainstream, and, was, studied, at, the, great, universities, such, as, nalanda, and, vikramashila, from, which, it, spread, to, tibet, and, to, the, east, asian, states, of, china, korea, and, japan, this, new, tantric, buddhism, was, supported, by, the, pala, dynasty, 8th, 12th, century, which, supported, these, centers, of, learning, and, also, built, grand, tantric, temples, and, monasteries, such, as, somapura, mahavihara, and, odantapuri, while, establishing, good, relations, with, the, tibetan, empire, and, srivijaya, empire, where, the, buddhist, mahasiddhas, of, the, vajrayana, tradition, spread, their, influence, via, songs, of, realization, like, those, collected, in, the, charyapada, which, were, orally, transmitted, in, various, lineages, and, translated, into, many, different, languages, over, time, the, later, khmer, kings, and, the, indonesian, srivijaya, kingdom, also, supported, tantric, buddhism, according, to, samuel, while, the, sexual, and, transgressive, practices, were, mostly, undertaken, in, symbolic, form, or, through, visualization, in, later, tibetan, buddhist, monastic, contexts, it, seems, that, in, the, eighth, to, tenth, century, indian, context, they, were, actually, performed, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, both, shaiva, and, buddhist, tantra, evolved, into, more, tame, philosophical, and, liberation, oriented, religions, this, transformation, saw, a, move, from, external, and, transgressive, rituals, towards, a, more, internalized, yogic, practice, focused, on, attaining, spiritual, insight, this, recasting, also, made, tantric, religions, much, less, open, to, attack, by, other, groups, in, shaivism, this, development, is, often, associated, with, the, kashmiri, master, abhinavagupta, c, 950, 1016, ce, and, his, followers, as, well, the, movements, which, were, influenced, by, their, work, like, the, sri, vidya, tradition, which, spread, as, far, as, south, india, and, has, been, referred, to, as, high, tantra, in, buddhism, this, taming, of, tantra, is, associated, with, the, adoption, of, tantra, by, buddhist, monastics, who, sought, to, incorporate, it, within, the, buddhist, mahayana, scholastic, framework, buddhist, tantras, were, written, down, and, scholars, like, abhayakaragupta, wrote, commentaries, on, them, another, important, figure, the, bengali, teacher, atisha, wrote, a, treatise, which, placed, tantra, as, the, culmination, of, a, graduated, mahayana, path, to, awakening, the, bodhipathaprad, pa, in, his, view, one, needed, to, first, begin, practicing, non, tantric, mahayana, and, then, later, one, might, be, ready, for, tantra, this, system, became, the, model, for, tantric, practice, among, some, tibetan, buddhist, schools, like, the, gelug, in, tibet, the, transgressive, and, sexual, practices, of, tantra, became, much, less, central, and, tantric, practice, was, seen, as, suitable, only, for, a, small, elite, group, new, tantras, continued, to, be, composed, during, this, later, period, as, well, such, as, the, kalachakra, c, 11th, century, which, seems, to, be, concerned, with, converting, buddhists, and, non, buddhists, alike, and, uniting, them, together, against, islam, the, kalachakra, teaches, sexual, yoga, but, also, warns, not, to, introduce, the, practice, of, ingesting, impure, substances, to, beginners, since, this, is, only, for, advanced, yogis, this, tantra, also, seems, to, want, to, minimize, the, impact, of, the, transgressive, practices, since, it, advises, tantrikas, to, outwardly, follow, the, customs, of, their, country, another, influential, development, during, this, period, was, the, codification, of, tantric, yogic, techniques, that, would, later, become, the, separate, movement, known, as, hatha, yoga, according, to, james, mallinson, the, original, source, text, for, hatha, yoga, is, the, vajrayana, buddhist, am, tasiddhi, 11th, century, ce, attributed, to, the, mahasiddha, virupa, this, text, was, later, adopted, by, saiva, yogic, traditions, such, as, the, naths, and, is, quoted, in, their, texts, another, tradition, of, hindu, tantra, developed, among, the, vaishnavas, this, was, called, the, p, car, tra, agama, tradition, this, tradition, avoided, the, transgressive, and, sexual, elements, that, were, embraced, by, the, saivas, and, the, buddhists, there, is, also, a, smaller, tantric, tradition, associated, with, surya, the, sun, god, jainism, also, seems, to, have, developed, a, substantial, tantra, corpus, based, on, the, saura, tradition, with, rituals, based, on, yakshas, and, yakshinis, however, this, jain, tantrism, was, mainly, used, for, pragmatic, purposes, like, protection, and, was, not, used, to, attain, liberation, complete, manuscripts, of, these, jain, tantras, have, not, survived, the, jains, also, seem, to, have, adopted, some, of, the, subtle, body, practices, of, tantra, but, not, sexual, yoga, the, svetambara, thinker, hemacandra, c, 1089, 1172, discusses, tantric, practices, extensively, such, as, internal, meditations, on, chakras, which, betray, kaula, and, nath, influences, there, seems, to, have, been, some, debate, regarding, the, appropriateness, of, tantra, among, the, hindus, those, belonging, to, the, more, orthodox, vedic, traditions, rejected, the, tantras, meanwhile, tantrikas, incorporated, vedic, ideas, within, their, own, systems, while, considering, the, tantras, as, the, higher, more, refined, understanding, meanwhile, some, tantrikas, considered, the, tantras, to, be, superior, to, the, vedas, while, others, considered, them, complementary, such, as, umapati, who, is, quoted, as, stating, the, veda, is, the, cow, the, true, agama, its, milk, according, to, samuel, the, great, advaita, philosopher, shankara, 9th, century, is, portrayed, in, his, biography, the, sankaravijaya, as, condemning, the, approaches, of, various, kinds, of, tantric, practitioners, and, defeating, them, through, argument, or, spiritual, power, he, also, is, said, to, have, encouraged, the, replacement, of, fierce, goddesses, with, benign, female, deities, and, thus, to, have, promoted, the, sri, vidya, tradition, which, worships, a, peaceful, and, sweet, goddess, tripura, sundari, though, it, is, far, from, certain, that, shankara, actually, campaigned, against, tantra, he, is, traditionally, seen, as, someone, who, purified, hinduism, from, transgressive, and, antinomian, tantric, practices, the, 14th, century, indian, scholar, m, dhav, c, rya, in, sarva, darsana, sangraha, wrote, copious, commentaries, on, then, existing, major, schools, of, indian, philosophies, and, practices, and, cited, the, works, of, the, 10th, century, abhinavagupta, who, was, considered, a, major, and, influential, tantra, scholar, however, madhavacarya, does, not, mention, tantra, as, a, separate, distinct, religious, or, ritual, driven, practice, the, early, 20th, century, indian, scholar, pandurang, vaman, kane, conjectured, that, madhavacharya, ignored, tantra, because, it, may, have, been, considered, scandalous, in, contrast, padoux, suggests, that, tantra, may, have, been, so, pervasive, by, the, 13th, century, that, it, was, not, regarded, as, being, a, distinct, system, hindu, tantra, while, practiced, by, some, of, the, general, lay, population, was, eventually, overshadowed, by, the, more, popular, bhakti, movements, that, swept, throughout, india, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, according, to, samuel, these, new, devotional, styles, of, religion, with, their, emphasis, on, emotional, submission, to, a, supreme, saviour, deity, whether, saivite, or, vaisnavite, were, better, adapted, perhaps, to, the, subaltern, role, of, non, muslim, groups, under, muslim, rule, saiva, tantra, did, remain, an, important, practice, among, most, saiva, ascetics, however, tantric, traditions, also, survived, in, certain, regions, such, as, among, the, naths, of, rajasthan, in, the, sri, vidya, tradition, of, south, india, and, in, the, bengali, bauls, in, buddhism, while, tantra, became, accepted, in, the, great, mahayana, establishments, of, nalanda, and, vikramashila, and, spread, to, the, himalayan, regions, it, also, experienced, serious, setbacks, in, other, regions, particularly, southeast, asia, in, burma, for, example, king, anawratha, 1044, 1077, is, said, to, have, disbanded, tantric, ari, monks, as, theravada, buddhism, became, dominant, in, south, east, asian, states, tantric, religions, became, marginalised, in, those, regions, in, sri, lanka, tantric, buddhism, also, suffered, debilitating, setbacks, initially, the, large, abhayagiri, monastery, was, a, place, where, the, practice, of, vajrayana, seems, to, have, flourished, during, the, 8th, century, however, abhayagiri, was, disbanded, and, forced, to, convert, to, the, orthodox, mah, vih, ra, sect, during, the, reign, of, parakramabahu, i, 1153, 1186, regarding, the, reception, of, tantra, during, the, period, of, hindu, modernism, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, samuel, writes, that, this, period, saw, a, radical, reframing, of, yogic, practices, away, from, the, tantric, context, samuel, notes, that, while, hindu, hatha, yoga, had, its, origins, in, a, saiva, tantric, context, given, the, extremely, negative, views, of, tantra, and, its, sexual, and, magical, practices, which, prevailed, in, middle, class, india, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, and, still, largely, prevail, today, this, was, an, embarrassing, heritage, much, effort, was, given, by, people, such, as, swami, vivekananda, into, reconstructing, yoga, generally, in, terms, of, a, selective, vedantic, reading, of, pata, jali, s, yogasutra, de, michelis, 2004, the, effort, was, largely, successful, and, many, modern, western, practitioners, of, yoga, for, health, and, relaxation, have, little, or, no, knowledge, of, its, original, function, as, a, preparation, for, the, internal, sexual, practices, of, the, nath, tradition, buddhist, tantra, has, survived, in, modern, indo, tibetan, buddhism, in, various, japanese, traditions, such, as, shingon, and, in, the, newar, buddhism, of, the, kathmandu, valley, there, are, also, magical, quasi, tantric, traditions, in, southeast, asia, sometimes, termed, esoteric, southern, buddhism, though, they, are, not, called, tantric, and, have, been, marginalised, by, state, supported, modernist, forms, of, theravada, buddhism, within, hinduism, the, word, tantra, often, refers, to, a, text, which, may, or, may, not, be, tantric, conversely, various, tantric, texts, are, actually, not, always, called, tantras, instead, they, may, be, called, gama, j, na, sa, hit, siddh, nta, vidy, there, are, also, tantric, upanishads, which, are, late, upanishads, as, well, as, tantric, puranas, and, puranas, influenced, by, tantric, ideas, besides, these, types, of, texts, there, are, also, various, types, of, tantric, sastras, treatises, which, may, be, commentaries, digests, compilations, monographs, collections, of, hymns, or, of, names, of, deities, and, mantras, and, works, on, mantras, though, much, of, this, vast, body, of, tantric, literature, is, in, sanskrit, others, have, also, been, written, in, indian, vernacular, languages, as, noted, by, padoux, the, largest, portion, of, these, tantric, works, are, shaiva, texts, tantric, texts, and, practitioners, tantrikas, and, tantrinis, are, often, contrasted, with, vedic, texts, and, those, who, practice, vedic, religion, vaidikas, this, non, vedic, path, was, often, termed, mantramarga, the, way, of, mantras, or, tantrasastra, tantra, teaching, one, of, the, most, well, known, comments, on, this, dichotomy, is, kulluka, bhatta, s, statement, in, his, 15th, century, commentary, to, the, manusmriti, which, states, that, revelation, sruti, is, twofold, vedic, and, tantric, hindu, tantric, teachings, are, generally, seen, as, revelations, from, a, divine, being, such, as, iva, or, the, goddess, which, are, considered, by, tantrikas, to, be, superior, to, the, vedas, in, leading, beings, to, liberation, they, are, also, considered, to, be, more, effective, during, the, kali, yuga, a, time, of, much, passion, kama, however, tantric, thinkers, like, abhinavagupta, while, considering, tantra, as, superior, do, not, totally, reject, vedic, teachings, and, instead, consider, them, valid, on, a, lower, level, since, they, also, derive, from, the, same, source, the, supreme, godhead, there, are, various, hindu, tantric, traditions, within, shaivism, shaktism, and, vaishnavism, there, are, numerous, tantric, texts, for, these, different, traditions, with, different, philosophical, points, of, view, ranging, from, theistic, dualism, to, absolute, monism, according, to, david, b, gray, one, of, the, most, important, tropes, in, the, history, of, the, dissemination, of, tantric, traditions, is, that, of, lineage, the, transmission, of, teachings, along, an, uninterrupted, lineage, from, master, to, disciple, the, so, called, gurupara, par, these, various, traditions, also, differ, among, themselves, on, how, heterodox, and, transgressive, they, are, vis, a, vis, the, vedic, tradition, since, tantric, rituals, became, so, widespread, certain, forms, of, tantra, were, eventually, accepted, by, many, orthodox, vedic, thinkers, such, as, jayanta, bhatta, and, yamunacarya, as, long, as, they, did, not, contradict, vedic, teaching, and, social, rules, tantric, scriptures, such, as, the, kali, centered, jayadrathayamala, also, state, that, tantrikas, can, follow, the, vedic, social, rules, out, of, convenience, and, for, the, benefit, of, their, clan, and, guru, however, not, all, vedic, thinkers, accepted, tantra, for, example, kumarila, bhatta, wrote, that, one, should, have, no, contact, with, tantrikas, nor, speak, to, them, aiva, tantra, is, called, the, mantram, rga, and, is, often, seen, as, being, a, separate, teaching, than, the, ascetic, atim, rga, tradition, which, includes, the, p, upatas, and, k, p, likas, there, are, various, doctrines, textual, classes, and, schools, of, shaiva, tantra, which, often, overlap, with, the, shakta, tradition, in, different, ways, the, aiva, siddh, nta, tradition, is, the, earliest, aiva, tantra, school, and, was, characterized, by, public, rituals, performed, by, priests, some, of, their, texts, like, the, ni, v, satattvasa, hit, have, been, dated, to, the, fifth, century, their, scriptures, the, aiva, agamas, and, basic, doctrines, are, also, shared, by, the, other, traditions, as, a, common, aiva, doctrine, and, many, of, their, rites, are, also, used, in, other, schools, of, shaiva, tantra, the, prescriptions, and, rituals, of, the, aiva, siddh, nta, agamas, are, generally, followed, by, aiva, temples, in, south, india, and, they, are, mostly, compatible, with, orthodox, brahmanism, lacking, terrifying, deities, and, animal, sacrifice, the, mantrap, ha, tradition, on, the, other, hand, worships, svacchanda, bhairava, a, terrifying, form, of, shiva, also, known, as, aghora, not, fearsome, this, tradition, promotes, the, skull, observance, kapalavrata, that, is, carrying, a, skull, a, skull, staff, khatavanga, and, worshipping, in, cremation, grounds, one, contemporary, group, of, kapalika, ascetics, are, the, aghoris, there, are, also, various, traditions, who, are, classified, as, vidy, p, ha, the, texts, of, this, tradition, focus, on, worshipping, goddesses, known, as, yogin, s, or, kin, s, and, include, antinomian, practices, dealing, with, charnel, grounds, and, sexuality, these, goddess, centered, traditions, of, the, kta, tantras, are, mostly, of, the, left, current, vamachara, and, are, thus, considered, more, heterodox, there, are, various, vidy, p, ha, traditions, which, focus, on, a, bipolar, bisexual, divinity, that, is, equal, parts, male, and, female, aiva, and, kta, the, yamalatantras, worship, bhairava, along, with, kapalini, the, goddess, of, the, skull, the, goddess, centered, traditions, are, known, as, the, kulam, rga, path, of, the, clans, referring, to, the, clans, of, the, goddesses, and, their, shakti, tantras, which, may, have, been, established, around, the, 9th, century, it, includes, sexual, rituals, sanguinary, practices, the, ritual, consumption, of, liquor, and, the, importance, of, spirit, possession, it, includes, various, sub, traditions, the, developed, in, different, regions, of, india, such, as, the, trika, lineage, which, worships, a, trio, of, deities, par, par, par, and, apar, the, tradition, of, the, fierce, goddess, guhyak, l, krama, tradition, focusing, on, the, goddess, k, l, the, kubjik, cult, and, the, southern, tradition, which, worships, the, beautiful, goddess, k, me, var, or, tripurasundar, during, the, 10th, century, the, syncretic, nondual, tradition, of, kashmir, aivism, developed, according, to, alexis, sanderson, this, tradition, arose, out, of, the, confrontation, between, the, dualistic, and, more, orthodox, aiva, siddh, nta, and, the, nondual, transgressive, traditions, of, the, trika, and, krama, according, to, david, b, gray, this, school, integrated, elements, from, both, of, these, traditions, the, end, result, was, a, nondualistic, system, in, which, the, transgressive, elements, were, internalized, and, hence, rendered, less, offensive, to, the, orthodox, the, philosophers, of, kashmir, aivism, especially, abhinavagupta, c, 975, 1025, ce, and, his, student, jayaratha, are, some, of, the, most, influential, philosophers, who, wrote, on, hindu, tantra, these, thinkers, synthesized, the, various, goddess, and, aiva, lineages, and, philosophies, into, a, comprehensive, and, influential, religious, system, according, to, david, white, abhinavagupta, sublimates, cosmeticizes, and, semanticizes, many, of, its, practices, into, a, type, of, meditative, asceticism, whose, aim, is, to, realize, a, transcendent, subjectivity, thus, his, work, domesticated, the, radically, antinomian, practices, of, vidy, p, ha, lineages, into, meditative, exercises, in, nepal, the, sarvamnaya, tantra, system, evolved, as, a, tantrik, tradition, which, drew, upon, the, mn, ya, system, amnaya, is, often, translated, as, transmission, this, system, serves, as, the, guiding, source, for, the, tradition, of, worship, of, deities, that, emanate, from, the, five, different, aspects, of, lord, iva, at, its, core, the, concept, of, mn, ya, revolves, around, the, idea, that, iva, with, his, five, faces, referred, to, as, sadashiva, imparts, the, secret, tantric, teachings, to, the, goddess, through, her, corresponding, five, emanations, scholarly, work, on, sarvamnaya, can, be, found, in, the, article, the, transmission, of, all, powers, sarv, mn, ya, kta, tantra, and, the, semiotics, of, power, in, nep, la, ma, ala, by, jeffrey, s, lidke, the, last, major, aiva, tantric, tradition, is, that, of, the, n, th, or, split, ear, k, npha, a, tradition, which, emerged, in, the, 12th, or, 13th, century, they, produced, various, ha, hayoga, texts, which, draw, on, tantric, yogas, while, the, kta, traditions, continued, to, develop, in, different, ways, sometimes, in, a, more, popular, and, devotional, direction, many, of, them, retain, various, tantric, elements, today, the, two, most, important, and, popular, kta, tantra, traditions, today, are, the, southern, kaula, transmission, which, focus, on, the, beautiful, goddess, r, r, kula, or, lalit, tripurasundar, and, the, northern, and, eastern, transmission, focusing, on, the, ferocious, goddess, k, l, k, l, kula, the, southern, transmission, gave, rise, to, the, r, vidy, tradition, an, important, tantric, religion, in, south, india, though, it, takes, much, of, its, philosophical, and, doctrinal, system, from, kashmir, shaivism, it, generally, avoids, the, transgressive, elements, and, is, orthodox, or, right, handed, bhaskararaya, 18th, century, is, considered, a, key, thinker, of, this, tradition, the, k, l, kula, tradition, is, particularly, important, in, east, and, south, india, and, k, l, remains, a, popular, goddess, in, india, a, focus, of, much, devotion, the, main, vai, ava, tradition, that, is, associated, with, tantra, is, the, pa, charatra, this, tradition, produced, a, number, of, tantric, texts, including, lakshmi, tantra, but, most, of, the, other, tantras, are, lost, however, this, sect, does, not, identify, itself, as, tantric, the, worship, and, ritual, of, most, of, the, vai, ava, temples, in, south, india, follow, this, tradition, which, is, ritually, similar, to, the, shaiva, siddhanta, according, to, padoux, from, the, doctrinal, point, of, view, they, are, nearer, to, brahmanical, orthodoxy, proudly, asserted, by, some, of, their, affiliates, and, their, mantras, are, indeed, often, vedic, according, to, david, b, gray, during, the, medieval, period, another, tantric, vai, ava, tradition, emerged, in, bengal, known, as, the, sahajiy, tradition, it, flourished, in, bengal, around, the, 16th, through, 19th, centuries, it, taught, that, each, individual, is, a, divinity, embodying, the, divine, couple, k, a, and, his, consort, r, dh, this, tradition, integrated, earlier, hindu, and, buddhist, tantric, practices, within, a, vai, ava, theological, framework, new, branches, tantric, techniques, fourfold, division, twofold, division, thought, forms, and, visualisation, yoga, there, are, various, buddhist, tantric, traditions, with, the, goal, of, attaining, enlightenment, which, are, called, by, different, names, such, as, vajrayana, secret, mantra, mantrayana, and, so, on, the, indo, tibetan, buddhist, tradition, has, been, dominant, in, tibet, and, the, himalayan, regions, it, first, spread, to, tibet, in, the, 8th, century, and, quickly, rose, to, prominence, the, tibetan, buddhist, tantric, teachings, have, recently, been, spread, to, the, western, world, by, the, tibetan, diaspora, nepalese, newar, buddhism, meanwhile, is, still, practiced, in, the, kathmandu, valley, by, the, newar, people, the, tradition, maintains, a, canon, of, sanskrit, texts, the, only, buddhist, tantric, tradition, to, still, do, so, buddhist, tantric, practices, and, texts, which, developed, from, the, 5th, to, the, 8th, centuries, were, translated, into, chinese, and, are, preserved, in, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, as, well, as, in, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, tantric, materials, involving, the, use, of, mantras, and, dharanis, began, to, appear, in, china, during, the, fifth, century, period, and, buddhist, masters, such, as, zhiyi, developed, proto, tantric, rituals, based, on, esoteric, texts, chinese, esoteric, buddhism, became, especially, influential, in, china, in, the, tang, dynasty, period, with, the, arrival, of, esoteric, masters, such, as, vajrabodhi, and, amoghavajra, to, the, capital, city, of, chang, an, the, succeeding, song, dynasty, saw, an, influx, of, new, esoteric, texts, being, transmitted, by, monks, from, central, asia, chinese, esoteric, buddhist, rituals, were, also, noted, to, be, particularly, popular, in, the, liao, dynasty, which, contended, with, the, song, for, control, of, northern, china, due, to, the, highly, eclectic, nature, of, chinese, buddhism, where, sectarian, denominations, were, not, strictly, drawn, between, the, various, buddhist, schools, even, during, the, tang, dynasty, and, where, most, buddhist, masters, mixed, practices, from, the, different, traditions, chinese, esoteric, buddhist, practices, were, absorbed, by, lineages, from, the, other, buddhist, traditions, such, as, chan, and, tiantai, for, example, the, northern, school, of, chan, even, became, known, for, its, esoteric, practices, of, dh, ra, s, and, mantras, during, the, yuan, and, ming, dynasty, periods, certain, esoteric, elements, from, tibetan, buddhism, were, also, adapted, and, incorporated, into, general, chinese, buddhist, practices, and, rituals, in, modern, chinese, buddhism, the, esoteric, traditions, continue, to, be, passed, on, and, practiced, through, numerous, tantric, rituals, such, as, the, liberation, rite, of, water, and, land, and, the, universal, crossing, p, d, rites, for, hungry, ghosts, which, involve, practices, like, deity, yoga, and, mandala, offerings, as, well, as, the, recitation, of, tantric, mantras, such, as, the, cund, dh, ra, the, hundred, syllable, mantra, of, vajrasattva, the, mah, cakravidy, r, ja, dh, ra, and, the, shurangama, mantra, esoteric, practices, also, spread, to, korea, and, to, japan, where, it, exists, as, an, independent, tradition, called, shingon, the, hindu, and, buddhist, tantric, traditions, significantly, influenced, other, religions, such, as, jainism, sikhism, the, tibetan, b, n, tradition, daoism, shint, sufi, islam, and, the, western, new, age, movement, in, the, sikh, literature, the, ideas, related, to, shakti, and, goddess, reverence, attributed, to, guru, gobind, singh, particularly, in, the, dasam, granth, are, related, to, tantra, ideas, found, in, buddhism, and, hinduism, the, jain, worship, methods, states, ellen, gough, were, likely, influenced, by, shaktism, ideas, and, this, is, attested, by, the, tantric, diagrams, of, the, rishi, mandala, where, the, tirthankaras, are, portrayed, the, tantric, traditions, within, jainism, use, verbal, spells, or, mantra, and, rituals, that, are, believed, to, accrue, merit, for, rebirth, realms, one, of, the, main, elements, of, the, tantric, literature, is, ritual, rather, than, one, coherent, system, tantra, is, an, accumulation, of, practices, and, ideas, from, different, sources, as, samuel, writes, the, tantric, traditions, are, a, confluence, of, a, variety, of, different, factors, and, components, these, elements, include, mandalas, mantras, internal, sexual, yogic, practices, fierce, male, and, female, deities, cremation, ground, symbolism, as, well, as, concepts, from, indian, philosophy, andr, padoux, notes, that, there, is, no, consensus, among, scholars, as, to, which, elements, are, characteristic, for, tantra, nor, is, there, any, text, that, contains, all, those, elements, also, most, of, those, elements, can, also, be, found, in, non, tantric, traditions, because, of, the, wide, range, of, communities, covered, by, the, term, it, is, problematic, to, describe, tantric, practices, definitively, however, there, are, sets, of, practices, and, elements, which, are, shared, by, numerous, tantric, traditions, and, thus, a, family, resemblance, relationship, can, be, established, among, them, different, scholars, give, different, main, features, of, tantra, for, example, david, n, lorenzen, writes, that, tantra, shares, various, shamanic, and, yogic, practices, worship, of, goddesses, association, with, specific, schools, like, the, kaulas, and, kapalikas, as, well, as, tantric, texts, christopher, wallis, meanwhile, basing, himself, on, the, definition, given, the, tantric, scholar, r, maka, ha, gives, four, main, features, of, tantra, 1, concern, with, ritual, modes, of, manipulation, of, the, environment, or, one, s, own, awareness, 2, requirement, for, esoteric, initiation, to, receive, access, to, the, scriptural, teachings, and, practices, 3, a, twofold, goal, of, practice, the, soteriological, and, supramundane, one, of, liberation, variously, conceived, and, or, the, mundane, one, of, extraordinary, power, over, other, beings, and, one, s, environment, and, 4, the, claim, that, these, three, are, explicated, in, scriptures, that, are, the, word, of, god, gama, or, the, buddha, buddhavacana, according, to, anthony, tribe, a, scholar, of, buddhist, tantra, tantra, has, the, following, defining, features, there, are, a, wide, array, of, tantric, techniques, or, spiritual, practices, sadhana, such, as, worship, or, puja, in, hindu, tantra, differs, from, vedic, forms, somewhat, while, in, the, vedic, practice, of, yajna, there, are, no, idols, shrines, and, symbolic, art, in, tantra, they, are, important, means, of, worship, rituals, are, particularly, important, in, the, dualistic, aiva, siddh, nta, which, according, to, padoux, is, typically, characterized, by, an, overabundance, of, rituals, which, are, necessarily, accompanied, by, mantras, these, rituals, are, not, so, much, a, succession, of, actions, as, a, play, of, mentally, visualized, and, experienced, images, a, situation, common, to, all, tantric, traditions, where, rites, meditation, and, yoga, are, exercises, in, creative, identifying, imagination, the, theory, behind, these, rituals, is, the, idea, that, all, humans, have, a, fundamental, impurity, mala, that, binds, them, to, rebirth, this, impurity, can, be, removed, by, ritual, action, along, with, proper, knowledge, the, initial, step, in, this, path, is, the, ritual, of, initiation, diksa, which, opens, to, door, to, future, liberation, at, death, in, the, non, dualistic, and, transgressive, or, left, hand, traditions, like, the, kali, cults, and, the, trika, school, rituals, and, pujas, can, include, certain, left, hand, path, elements, that, are, not, found, in, the, more, orthodox, traditions, these, transgressive, elements, include, the, use, of, skulls, and, other, human, bone, implements, as, part, of, the, kapalika, vow, fierce, deities, like, bhairava, kubjika, and, kali, which, were, used, as, part, of, meditative, visualizations, ritual, possession, by, the, deities, avesa, sexual, rites, and, offering, the, deity, as, well, as, consuming, certain, impure, substances, like, meat, alcohol, and, sexual, fluids, padoux, explains, the, transgressive, practices, as, follows, on, the, ritual, and, mental, plane, transgression, was, an, essential, trait, by, which, the, nondualistic, tantric, traditions, set, themselves, apart, from, other, traditions, so, much, so, that, they, used, the, term, nondualistic, practice, advaitacara, to, refer, to, the, kaula, transgressive, practices, as, a, rejection, of, the, duality, dvaita, of, pure, and, impure, in, brahmanical, society, let, us, also, note, that, for, the, nondualistic, saiva, systems, the, yoginis, were, not, active, merely, in, the, world, of, spirits, they, were, also, powers, present, in, humans, mistresses, of, their, senses, governing, their, affects, which, acquired, an, intensity, and, super, natural, dimension, through, this, divinization, this, led, adepts, to, an, identification, of, their, individual, consciousness, with, the, infinite, divine, consciousness, thus, also, helping, them, transcend, the, sexual, plane, in, both, the, buddhist, and, saiva, contexts, the, sexual, practices, are, often, seen, as, a, way, to, expand, one, s, consciousness, through, the, use, of, bliss, there, is, also, a, fundamental, philosophical, disagreement, between, aiva, siddh, nta, and, the, non, dualistic, schools, like, the, trika, regarding, ritual, in, aiva, siddh, nta, only, ritual, can, do, away, with, innate, impurities, anavamala, that, bind, individual, selfs, though, the, ritual, must, be, performed, with, an, understanding, of, their, nature, and, purpose, as, well, as, with, devotion, in, the, view, of, the, trika, school, especially, in, the, work, of, abhinavagupta, only, knowledge, j, ana, which, is, a, recognition, pratyabhij, a, of, our, true, nature, leads, to, liberation, according, to, padoux, this, is, also, with, nuances, the, position, of, the, p, caratra, and, of, other, vaisnava, tantric, traditions, tantric, yoga, is, first, and, foremost, an, embodied, practice, which, is, seen, as, having, a, divine, esoteric, structure, as, noted, by, padoux, tantric, yoga, makes, use, of, a, mystic, physiology, which, includes, various, psychosomatic, elements, known, as, the, subtle, body, this, imaginary, inner, structure, includes, chakras, wheels, nadis, channels, and, energies, like, kundalini, chandali, different, pranas, and, vital, winds, etc, the, tantric, body, is, also, held, to, be, a, microcosmic, reflection, of, the, universe, and, is, thus, seen, as, containing, gods, and, goddesses, according, to, padoux, the, internalized, image, of, the, yogic, body, is, a, fundamental, element, for, nearly, all, meditative, and, tantric, ritual, practices, the, use, of, mantras, is, one, of, the, most, common, and, widespread, elements, of, tantric, practice, they, are, used, in, rituals, as, well, as, during, various, meditative, and, yogic, practices, mantra, recitation, japa, is, often, practiced, along, with, nyasa, depositing, the, mantra, mudras, seals, i, e, hand, gestures, and, complex, visualizations, involving, divine, symbols, mandalas, and, deities, nyasa, involves, touching, various, parts, of, the, body, while, reciting, mantra, which, is, thought, to, connect, the, deity, with, the, yogis, body, and, transform, the, body, into, that, of, the, deity, mantras, are, also, often, visualized, as, being, located, within, the, yogi, s, body, as, part, of, tantric, meditations, for, example, in, the, yogini, heart, tantra, a, r, vidy, text, the, yogi, is, instructed, to, imagine, the, five, syllables, ha, sa, ka, la, hrim, of, the, deity, s, mantra, in, the,

of, the, deity, the, practitioner, may, use, visualizations, identifying, with, a, deity, to, the, degree, that, the, aspirant, becomes, the, ishta, deva, or, meditational, deity, in, other, meditations, the, deities, are, visualized, as, being, inside, the, tantrika, s, body, for, example, in, abhinavagupta, s, tantraloka, chapter, 15, the, trika, trinity, of, goddesses, par, par, par, and, apar, are, visualized, on, the, ends, of, the, three, prongs, of, a, trident, located, above, the, head, the, rest, of, the, trident, is, imagined, positioned, along, the, central, axis, of, the, yogi, s, body, with, the, blazing, corpse, of, shiva, visualized, in, the, head, yantra, are, mystical, diagrams, which, are, used, in, tantric, meditation, and, ritual, they, are, usually, associated, with, specific, hindu, deities, such, as, shiva, shakti, or, kali, similarly, a, puja, may, involve, focusing, on, a, yantra, or, mandala, associated, with, a, deity, according, to, david, gordon, white, geometrical, mandalas, are, a, key, element, of, tantra, they, are, used, to, represent, numerous, tantric, ideas, and, concepts, as, well, as, used, for, meditative, focus, mandalas, symbolically, communicate, the, correspondences, between, the, transcendent, yet, immanent, macrocosm, and, the, microcosm, of, mundane, human, experience, the, godhead, or, principal, buddha, is,

actions, as, part, of, a, tantric, sadhana, practice, while, tantra, involves, a, wide, range, of, ideas, and, practices, which, are, not, always, of, a, sexual, nature, flood, and, padoux, both, note, that, in, the, west, tantra, is, most, often, thought, of, as, a, kind, of, ritualized, sex, or, a, spiritualized, yogic, sexuality, according, to, padoux, this, is, a, misunderstanding, for, though, the, place, of, sex, in, tantra, is, ideologically, essential, it, is, not, always, so, in, action, and, ritual, padoux, further, notes, that, while, sexual, practices, do, exist, and, were, used, by, certain, tantric, groups, they, lost, their, prevalence, when, tantra, spread, to, other, larger, social, groups, in, the, tantric, traditions, which, do, use, sex, as, part, of, spiritual, practice, this, refers, mainly, to, the, kaulas, and, also, tibetan, buddhism, sex, and, desire, are, often, seen, as, a, means, of, transcendence, that, is, used, to, reach, the, absolute, thus, sex, and, desire, are, not, seen, as, ends, in, themselves, because, these, practices, transgress, orthodox, hindu, ideas, of, ritual, purity, they, have, often, given, tantra, a, bad, image, in, india, where, it, is, often, condemned, by, the, orthodox, according, to, padoux, even, among, the, traditions, which, accept, these, practices, they, are, far, from, prominent, and, practiced, only, by, a,

avalon, and, is, known, as, the, founding, father, of, tantric, studies, unlike, previous, western, scholars, woodroffe, advocated, for, tantra, defending, and, presenting, it, as, an, ethical, and, philosophical, system, in, accord, with, the, vedas, and, vedanta, woodroffe, practised, tantra, and, while, trying, to, maintain, scholastic, objectivity, was, a, student, of, hindu, tantra, the, shiva, shakta, tradition, following, woodroffe, a, number, of, scholars, began, investigating, tantric, teachings, including, scholars, of, comparative, religion, and, indology, such, as, agehananda, bharati, mircea, eliade, julius, evola, carl, jung, alexandra, david, n, el, giuseppe, tucci, and, heinrich, zimmer, according, to, hugh, urban, zimmer, evola, and, eliade, viewed, tantra, as, the, culmination, of, all, indian, thought, the, most, radical, form, of, spirituality, and, the, archaic, heart, of, aboriginal, india, regarding, it, as, the, ideal, religion, for, the, modern, era, all,
