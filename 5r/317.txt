them, have, more, than, a, million, members, there, is, no, single, agreed, upon, criterion, for, defining, a, new, religious, movement, debate, continues, as, to, how, the, term, new, should, be, interpreted, in, this, context, one, perspective, is, that, it, should, designate, a, religion, that, is, more, recent, in, its, origins, than, large, well, established, religions, like, hinduism, judaism, buddhism, christianity, and, islam, some, scholars, view, the, 1950s, or, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, in, 1945, as, the, defining, time, while, others, look, as, far, back, as,

out, information, recruit, members, and, sometimes, to, hold, online, meetings, and, rituals, that, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, cybersectarianism, sabina, magliocco, professor, of, anthropology, and, folklore, at, california, state, university, northridge, has, discussed, the, growing, popularity, of, new, religious, movements, on, the, internet, in, 2006, j, gordon, melton, executive, director, of, the, institute, for, the, study, of, american, religions, at, the, university, of, california, santa, barbara, told, the, new, york, times, that, 40, to, 45, new, religious, movements, emerge, each, year, in, the, united, states, in, 2007, religious, scholar, elijah, siegler, said, that, though, no, nrm, had, become, the, dominant, faith, in, any, country, many, of, the, concepts, they, first, introduced, often, referred, to, as, new, age, ideas, have, become, part, of, worldwide, mainstream, culture, eileen, barker, has, argued, that, nrms, should, not, be, lumped, together, as, they, differ, from, one, another, on, many, issues, virtually, no, generalisation, can, be, made, about, nrms, that, applies, to, every, group, with, david, v, barrett, noting, that, generalizations, tend, not, to, be, very, helpful, when, studying, nrms, j, gordon, melton, expressed, the, view, that, there, is, no, single, characteristic, or, set, of, characteristics, that, all, new, religions, share, not, even, their, newness, bryan, wilson, wrote, chief, among, the, miss, directed, assertions, has, been, the, tendency, to, speak, of, new, religious, movements, as, if, they, differed, very, little, if, at, all, one, from, another, the, tendency, has, been, to, lump, them, together, and, indiscriminately, attribute, all, of, the, characteristics, which, are, in, fact, valid, for, only, one, or, two, nrms, themselves, often, claim, that, they, exist, at, a, crucial, place, in, time, and, space, some, nrms, venerate, unique, scriptures, while, others, reinterpret, existing, texts, utilizing, a, range, of, older, elements, they, frequently, claim, that, these, are, not, new, but, rather, forgotten, truths, that, are, being, revived, nrm, scriptures, often, incorporate, modern, scientific, knowledge, sometimes, with, the, claim, that, they, are, bringing, unity, to, science, and, religion, some, nrms, believe, that, their, scriptures, are, received, through, mediums, the, urantia, book, the, core, scripture, of, the, urantia, movement, was, published, in, 1955, and, is, said, to, be, the, product, of, a, continuous, process, of, revelation, from, celestial, beings, which, began, in, 1911, some, nrms, particularly, those, that, are, forms, of, occultism, have, a, prescribed, system, of, courses, and, grades, through, which, members, can, progress, some, nrms, promote, celibacy, the, state, of, voluntarily, being, unmarried, sexually, abstinent, or, both, some, including, the, shakers, and, more, recent, nrms, inspired, by, hindu, traditions, see, it, as, a, lifelong, commitment, others, including, the, unification, church, as, a, stage, in, spiritual, development, in, some, buddhist, nrms, celibacy, is, practiced, mostly, by, older, women, who, become, nuns, some, people, join, nrms, and, practice, celibacy, as, a, rite, of, passage, in, order, to, move, beyond, previous, sexual, problems, or, bad, experiences, groups, that, promote, celibacy, require, a, strong, recruitment, drive, to, survive, the, shakers, established, orphanages, hoping, that, the, children, would, become, members, of, their, community, violent, incidents, involving, nrms, are, very, rare, in, events, having, a, large, number, of, casualties, the, new, religion, was, led, by, a, charismatic, leader, beginning, in, 1978, the, deaths, of, 913, members, of, the, peoples, temple, in, jonestown, guyana, by, both, murder, and, suicide, brought, an, image, of, killer, cults, to, public, attention, several, subsequent, events, contributed, to, the, concept, in, 1994, members, of, the, order, of, the, solar, temple, committed, suicide, in, canada, and, switzerland, in, 1997, 39, members, of, the, heaven, s, gate, group, committed, suicide, in, the, belief, that, their, spirits, would, leave, the, earth, and, join, a, passing, comet, there, have, also, been, cases, in, which, members, of, nrms, have, been, killed, after, they, engaged, in, dangerous, actions, due, to, mistaken, belief, in, their, own, invincibility, for, example, in, uganda, several, hundred, members, of, the, holy, spirit, movement, were, killed, as, they, approached, gunfire, because, its, leader, alice, lakwena, told, them, that, they, would, be, protected, from, bullets, by, the, oil, of, the, shea, tree, the, history, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, includes, multiple, cases, of, significant, violence, committed, by, or, against, mormons, nrms, are, typically, founded, and, led, by, a, charismatic, leader, the, death, of, any, religion, s, founder, represents, a, significant, moment, in, its, history, over, the, months, and, years, following, its, leader, s, death, the, movement, can, die, out, fragment, into, multiple, groups, consolidate, its, position, or, change, its, nature, to, become, something, quite, different, from, what, its, founder, intended, in, some, cases, a, nrm, moves, closer, to, the, religious, mainstream, after, the, death, of, its, founder, a, number, of, founders, of, new, religions, established, plans, for, succession, to, prevent, confusion, after, their, deaths, mary, baker, eddy, the, american, founder, of, christian, science, spent, fifteen, years, working, on, her, book, the, manual, of, the, mother, church, which, laid, out, how, the, group, should, be, run, by, her, successors, the, leadership, of, the, bah, faith, passed, through, a, succession, of, individuals, until, 1963, when, it, was, assumed, by, the, universal, house, of, justice, members, of, which, are, elected, by, the, worldwide, congregation, a, c, bhaktivedanta, swami, prabhupada, the, founder, of, the, international, society, for, krishna, consciousness, appointed, 11, western, gurus, to, act, as, initiating, gurus, and, to, continue, to, direct, the, organisation, however, according, to, british, scholar, of, religion, gavin, flood, many, problems, followed, from, their, appointment, and, the, movement, has, since, veered, away, from, investing, absolute, authority, in, a, few, fallible, human, teachers, nrms, typically, consist, largely, of, first, generation, believers, and, thus, often, have, a, younger, average, membership, than, mainstream, religious, congregations, some, nrms, have, been, formed, by, groups, who, have, split, from, a, pre, existing, religious, group, as, these, members, grow, older, many, have, children, who, are, then, brought, up, within, the, nrm, in, the, third, world, nrms, most, often, appeal, to, the, poor, and, oppressed, sectors, of, society, within, western, countries, they, are, more, likely, to, appeal, to, members, of, the, middle, and, upper, middle, classes, with, barrett, stating, that, new, religions, in, the, uk, and, us, largely, attract, white, middle, class, late, teens, and, twenties, there, are, exceptions, such, as, the, rastafari, movement, and, the, nation, of, islam, which, have, primarily, attracted, black, members, a, popular, conception, unsupported, by, evidence, holds, that, those, who, convert, to, new, religions, are, either, mentally, ill, or, become, so, through, their, involvement, with, them, dick, anthony, a, forensic, psychologist, noted, for, his, writings, on, the, brainwashing, controversy, has, defended, nrms, and, in, 1988, argued, that, involvement, in, such, movements, may, often, be, beneficial, there, s, a, large, research, literature, published, in, mainstream, journals, on, the, mental, health, effects, of, new, religions, for, the, most, part, the, effects, seem, to, be, positive, in, any, way, that, s, measurable, those, who, convert, to, a, nrm, typically, believe, that, in, doing, so, they, are, gaining, some, benefit, in, their, life, this, can, come, in, many, forms, from, an, increasing, sense, of, freedom, to, a, release, from, drug, dependency, and, a, feeling, of, self, respect, and, direction, many, of, those, who, have, left, nrms, report, that, they, have, gained, from, their, experience, there, are, various, reasons, as, to, why, an, individual, would, join, and, then, remain, part, of, a, nrm, including, both, push, and, pull, factors, according, to, marc, galanter, professor, of, psychiatry, at, nyu, typical, reasons, why, people, join, nrms, include, a, search, for, community, and, a, spiritual, quest, sociologists, stark, and, bainbridge, in, discussing, the, process, by, which, people, join, new, religious, groups, have, questioned, the, utility, of, the, concept, of, conversion, suggesting, that, affiliation, is, a, more, useful, concept, a, popular, explanation, for, why, people, join, new, religious, movements, is, that, they, have, been, brainwashed, or, subject, to, mind, control, by, the, nrm, itself, this, explanation, provides, a, rationale, for, deprogramming, a, process, in, which, members, of, nrms, are, illegally, kidnapped, by, individuals, who, then, attempt, to, convince, them, to, reject, their, beliefs, professional, deprogrammers, therefore, have, a, financial, interest, in, promoting, the, brainwashing, explanation, academic, research, however, has, demonstrated, that, these, brainwashing, techniques, simply, do, not, exist, many, members, of, nrms, leave, these, groups, of, their, own, free, will, some, of, those, who, do, so, retain, friends, within, the, movement, some, of, those, who, leave, a, religious, community, are, unhappy, with, the, time, that, they, spent, as, part, of, it, leaving, a, nrm, can, pose, a, number, of, difficulties, it, may, result, in, their, having, to, abandon, a, daily, framework, that, they, had, previously, adhered, to, it, may, also, generate, mixed, emotions, as, ex, members, lose, the, feelings, of, absolute, certainty, which, they, may, have, held, while, in, the, group, three, basic, questions, have, been, paramount, in, orienting, theory, and, research, on, nrms, what, are, the, identifying, markers, of, nrms, that, distinguish, them, from, other, types, of, religious, groups, what, are, the, different, types, of, nrms, and, how, do, these, different, types, relate, to, the, established, institutional, order, of, the, host, society, and, what, are, the, most, important, ways, that, nrms, respond, to, the, sociocultural, dislocation, that, leads, to, their, formation, sociologist, of, religion, david, g, bromley, the, academic, study, of, new, religious, movements, is, known, as, new, religions, studies, nrs, the, study, draws, from, the, disciplines, of, anthropology, psychiatry, history, psychology, sociology, religious, studies, and, theology, barker, noted, that, there, are, five, sources, of, information, on, nrms, the, information, provided, by, such, groups, themselves, that, provided, by, ex, members, as, well, as, the, friends, and, relatives, of, members, organisations, that, collect, information, on, nrms, the, mainstream, media, and, academics, studying, such, phenomena, the, study, of, new, religions, is, unified, by, its, topic, of, interest, rather, than, by, its, methodology, and, is, therefore, interdisciplinary, in, nature, a, sizeable, body, of, scholarly, literature, on, new, religions, has, been, published, most, of, it, produced, by, social, scientists, among, the, disciplines, that, nrs, utilises, are, anthropology, history, psychology, religious, studies, and, sociology, of, these, approaches, sociology, played, a, particularly, prominent, role, in, the, development, of, the, field, resulting, in, it, being, initially, confined, largely, to, a, narrow, array, of, sociological, questions, this, came, to, change, in, later, scholarship, which, began, to, apply, theories, and, methods, initially, developed, for, examining, more, mainstream, religions, to, the, study, of, new, ones, most, research, has, been, directed, toward, those, new, religions, that, attract, public, controversy, less, controversial, nrms, tend, to, be, the, subject, of, less, scholarly, research, it, has, also, been, noted, that, scholars, of, new, religions, often, avoid, researching, certain, movements, that, scholars, from, other, backgrounds, study, the, feminist, spirituality, movement, is, usually, examined, by, scholars, of, women, s, studies, african, american, new, religions, by, scholars, of, africana, studies, and, native, american, new, religions, by, scholars, of, native, american, studies, j, gordon, melton, argued, that, new, religious, movements, should, be, defined, by, the, way, dominant, religious, and, secular, forces, within, a, given, society, treat, them, according, to, him, nrms, constituted, those, religious, groups, that, have, been, found, from, the, perspective, of, the, dominant, religious, community, and, in, the, west, that, is, almost, always, a, form, of, christianity, to, be, not, just, different, but, unacceptably, different, barker, cautioned, against, melton, s, approach, arguing, that, negating, the, newness, of, new, religious, movements, raises, problems, for, it, is, the, very, fact, that, nrms, are, new, that, explains, many, of, the, key, characteristics, they, display, george, chryssides, favors, simple, definition, for, him, nrm, is, an, organization, founded, within, the, past, 150, or, so, years, which, cannot, be, easily, classified, within, one, of, the, world, s, main, religious, traditions, scholars, of, religion, olav, hammer, and, mikael, rothstein, argued, that, new, religions, are, just, young, religions, and, as, a, result, they, are, not, inherently, different, from, mainstream, and, established, religious, movements, with, the, differences, between, the, two, having, been, greatly, exaggerated, by, the, media, and, popular, perceptions, melton, has, stated, that, those, nrms, that, were, offshoots, of, older, religious, groups, tended, to, resemble, their, parent, groups, far, more, than, they, resembled, each, other, one, question, that, faces, scholars, of, religion, is, when, a, new, religious, movement, ceases, to, be, new, as, noted, by, barker, in, the, first, century, christianity, was, new, in, the, seventh, century, islam, was, new, in, the, eighteenth, century, methodism, was, new, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, seventh, day, adventists, christadelphians, and, jehovah, s, witnesses, were, new, in, the, twenty, first, century, the, unification, church, the, iskcon, and, scientology, are, beginning, to, look, old, the, roman, catholic, church, has, observed, that, the, growth, of, sects, and, new, religious, movements, is, one, of, the, most, noticeable, and, highly, complex, developments, in, recent, years, and, in, relation, to, the, ecumenical, movement, their, desire, for, peaceful, relations, with, the, catholic, church, may, be, weak, or, non, existent, some, nrms, are, strongly, counter, cultural, and, alternative, in, the, society, where, they, appear, while, others, are, far, more, similar, to, a, society, s, established, traditional, religions, generally, christian, denominations, are, not, seen, as, new, religious, movements, nevertheless, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, jehovah, s, witnesses, christian, science, and, the, shakers, have, been, studied, as, nrms, the, same, situation, with, jewish, religious, movements, when, reform, judaism, and, newer, divisions, have, been, named, among, nrm, there, are, also, problems, in, the, use, of, religion, within, the, term, new, religious, movements, this, is, because, various, groups, particularly, active, within, the, new, age, milieu, have, many, traits, in, common, with, different, nrms, but, emphasise, personal, development, and, humanistic, psychology, and, are, not, clearly, religious, in, nature, since, at, least, the, early, 2000s, most, sociologists, of, religion, have, used, the, term, new, religious, movement, in, order, to, avoid, the, pejorative, undertones, of, terms, like, cult, and, sect, these, are, words, that, have, been, used, in, different, ways, by, different, groups, for, instance, from, the, nineteenth, century, onward, a, number, of, sociologists, used, the, terms, cult, and, sect, in, very, specific, ways, the, sociologist, ernst, troeltsch, for, instance, differentiated, churches, from, sect, by, claiming, that, the, former, term, should, apply, to, groups, that, stretch, across, social, strata, while, sects, typically, contain, converts, from, socially, disadvantaged, sectors, of, society, the, term, cult, is, used, in, reference, to, devotion, or, dedication, to, a, particular, person, or, place, for, instance, within, the, roman, catholic, church, devotion, to, mary, mother, of, jesus, may, be, termed, the, cult, of, mary, it, is, also, used, in, non, religious, contexts, to, refer, to, fandoms, devoted, to, television, shows, like, the, prisoner, the, x, files, and, buffy, the, vampire, slayer, in, the, united, states, people, began, to, use, cult, in, a, pejorative, manner, to, refer, to, spiritualism, and, christian, science, during, the, 1890s, as, commonly, used, for, instance, in, sensationalist, tabloid, articles, the, term, cult, continues, to, have, pejorative, associations, the, term, new, religions, is, a, calque, of, shinsh, ky, a, japanese, term, developed, to, describe, the, proliferation, of, japanese, new, religions, in, the, years, following, the, second, world, war, from, japan, this, term, was, translated, and, used, by, several, american, authors, including, jacob, needleman, to, describe, the, range, of, groups, that, appeared, in, the, san, francisco, bay, area, during, the, 1960s, this, term, amongst, others, was, adopted, by, western, scholars, as, an, alternative, to, cult, however, new, religious, movements, has, failed, to, gain, widespread, public, usage, in, the, manner, that, cult, has, other, terms, that, have, been, employed, for, many, nrms, are, alternative, religion, and, alternative, spirituality, something, used, to, convey, the, difference, between, these, groups, and, established, or, mainstream, religious, movements, while, at, the, same, time, evading, the, problem, posed, by, groups, that, are, not, particularly, new, the, 1970s, was, the, era, of, the, so, called, cult, wars, led, by, cult, watching, groups, the, efforts, of, the, anti, cult, movement, condensed, a, moral, panic, around, the, concept, of, cults, public, fears, around, satanism, in, particular, came, to, be, known, as, a, distinct, phenomenon, the, satanic, panic, consequently, scholars, such, as, eileen, barker, james, t, richardson, timothy, miller, and, catherine, wessinger, argued, that, the, term, cult, had, become, too, laden, with, negative, connotations, and, advocated, dropping, its, use, in, academia, a, number, of, alternatives, to, the, term, new, religious, movement, are, used, by, some, scholars, these, include, alternative, religious, movements, miller, emergent, religions, ellwood, and, marginal, religious, movements, harper, and, le, beau, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, saw, the, emergence, of, a, number, of, highly, visible, new, religious, movements, seemed, so, outlandish, that, many, people, saw, them, as, evil, cults, fraudulent, organizations, or, scams, that, recruited, unaware, people, by, means, of, mind, control, techniques, real, or, serious, religions, it, was, felt, should, appear, in, recognizable, institutionalized, forms, be, suitably, ancient, and, above, all, advocate, relatively, familiar, theological, notions,
