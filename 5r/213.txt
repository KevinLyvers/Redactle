https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism
nontrinitarianism, is, a, form, of, christianity, that, rejects, the, mainstream, christian, theology, of, the, trinity, the, belief, that, god, is, three, distinct, hypostases, or, persons, who, are, coeternal, coequal, and, indivisibly, united, in, one, being, or, essence, from, the, ancient, greek, ousia, certain, religious, groups, that, emerged, during, the, protestant, reformation, have, historically, been, known, as, antitrinitarian, according, to, churches, that, consider, the, decisions, of, ecumenical, councils, final, trinitarianism, was, definitively, declared, to, be, christian, doctrine, at, the, 4th, century, ecumenical, councils, that, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, 325, which, declared, the, full, divinity, of, the, son, and, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, which, declared, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, in, terms, of, number, of, adherents, nontrinitarian, denominations, comprise, a, small, minority, of, modern, christians, after, the, denominations, in, the, oneness, pentecostal, movement, the, largest, nontrinitarian, christian, denominations, are, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, jehovah, s, witnesses, la, luz, del, mundo, and, iglesia, ni, cristo, there, are, a, number, of, other, smaller, groups, including, christadelphians, church, of, the, blessed, hope, christian, scientists, dawn, bible, students, living, church, of, god, assemblies, of, yahweh, members, church, of, god, international, unitarian, christians, unitarian, universalist, christians, the, way, international, the, philadelphia, church, of, god, the, church, of, god, international, the, united, church, of, god, church, of, god, general, conference, restored, church, of, god, christian, disciples, church, and, church, of, god, of, the, faith, of, abraham, nontrinitarian, views, differ, widely, on, the, nature, of, god, jesus, and, the, holy, spirit, various, nontrinitarian, philosophies, such, as, adoptionism, and, monarchianism, existed, prior, to, the, codification, of, the, trinity, doctrine, in, ad, 325, 381, and, 431, at, the, councils, of, nicaea, constantinople, and, ephesus, nontrinitarianism, was, later, renewed, by, cathars, in, the, 11th, through, 13th, centuries, in, the, unitarian, movement, during, the, protestant, reformation, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, of, the, 18th, century, and, in, some, groups, arising, during, the, second, great, awakening, of, the, 19th, century, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, as, held, in, mainstream, christianity, is, not, present, in, the, other, major, monotheistic, abrahamic, religions, christian, apologists, and, other, church, fathers, of, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, having, adopted, and, formulated, the, logos, christology, considered, the, son, of, god, as, the, instrument, used, by, the, supreme, god, the, father, to, bring, the, creation, into, existence, justin, martyr, theophilus, of, antioch, hippolytus, of, rome, and, tertullian, in, particular, state, that, the, internal, logos, of, god, gr, logos, endiathetos, lat, ratio, his, impersonal, divine, reason, was, begotten, as, logos, uttered, gr, logos, prophorikos, lat, sermo, verbum, the, word, personified, becoming, an, actual, person, to, be, used, for, the, purpose, of, creation, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, 11th, edition, states, to, some, christians, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, appeared, inconsistent, with, the, unity, of, god, they, therefore, denied, it, and, accepted, jesus, christ, not, as, incarnate, god, but, as, god, s, highest, creature, by, whom, all, else, was, created, view, in, the, early, church, long, contended, with, the, orthodox, doctrine, although, the, trinitarian, view, became, the, orthodox, doctrine, in, mainstream, christianity, variations, of, the, nontrinitarian, view, are, still, held, by, a, relatively, small, number, of, christian, groups, and, denominations, various, views, exist, regarding, the, relationships, between, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, although, nontrinitarian, beliefs, continued, and, were, dominant, among, some, peoples, for, example, the, lombards, ostrogoths, visigoths, and, vandals, for, hundreds, of, years, the, trinity, doctrine, eventually, gained, prominence, in, the, roman, empire, nontrinitarians, typically, argue, that, early, nontrinitarian, beliefs, such, as, arianism, were, systematically, suppressed, often, to, the, point, of, death, after, the, first, council, of, nicaea, roman, emperor, constantine, i, issued, an, edict, against, arius, writings, which, included, systematic, book, burning, in, spite, of, the, decree, constantine, ordered, the, readmission, of, arius, to, the, church, removed, the, bishops, including, athanasius, who, upheld, the, teaching, of, nicaea, allowed, arianism, to, grow, within, the, empire, and, to, spread, to, germanic, tribes, on, the, frontier, and, was, himself, baptized, by, an, arian, bishop, eusebius, of, nicomedia, his, successors, as, christian, emperors, promoted, arianism, until, theodosius, i, came, to, the, throne, in, 379, and, supported, nicene, christianity, the, easter, letter, that, athanasius, issued, in, 367, when, the, eastern, empire, was, ruled, by, the, arian, emperor, valens, specified, the, books, that, belong, to, the, old, testament, and, the, new, testament, together, with, seven, other, books, to, be, read, for, instruction, in, the, word, of, godliness, it, also, excluded, what, athanasius, called, apocryphal, writings, falsely, presented, as, ancient, elaine, pagels, writes, in, ad, 367, athanasius, the, zealous, bishop, of, alexandria, issued, an, easter, letter, in, which, he, demanded, that, egyptian, monks, destroy, all, such, unacceptable, writings, except, for, those, he, specifically, listed, as, acceptable, even, canonical, a, list, that, constitutes, the, present, new, testament, nontrinitarians, see, the, nicene, creed, and, the, results, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, as, essentially, political, documents, resulting, from, the, subordination, of, true, doctrine, to, state, interests, by, leaders, of, the, catholic, church, so, that, the, church, became, in, their, view, an, extension, of, the, roman, empire, nontrinitarians, both, modalists, and, unitarians, assert, that, athanasius, and, others, at, nicaea, adopted, greek, platonic, philosophy, and, concepts, and, incorporated, them, in, their, views, of, god, and, christ, the, author, h, g, wells, later, famous, for, his, contribution, to, science, fiction, wrote, in, the, outline, of, history, we, shall, see, presently, how, later, on, all, christendom, was, torn, by, disputes, about, the, trinity, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, apostles, of, jesus, ever, heard, of, the, trinity, at, any, rate, from, him, the, question, of, why, such, a, central, doctrine, to, the, christian, faith, would, never, have, been, explicitly, stated, in, scripture, or, taught, in, detail, by, jesus, himself, was, sufficiently, important, to, 16th, century, historical, figures, such, as, michael, servetus, to, lead, them, to, argue, the, question, the, geneva, city, council, in, accord, with, the, judgment, of, the, cantons, of, z, rich, bern, basel, and, schaffhausen, condemned, servetus, to, be, burned, at, the, stake, for, this, and, his, opposition, to, infant, baptism, the, encyclop, dia, of, religion, and, ethics, describes, the, five, stages, that, led, to, the, formulation, of, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, by, 1530, following, the, protestant, reformation, and, the, german, peasants, war, of, 1524, 1525, large, areas, of, northern, europe, were, protestant, and, forms, of, nontrinitarianism, began, to, surface, among, some, radical, reformation, groups, particularly, anabaptists, the, first, recorded, english, antitrinitarian, was, john, assheton, 1548, an, anglican, priest, the, italian, anabaptist, council, of, venice, 1550, and, the, trial, of, michael, servetus, 1553, marked, the, clear, emergence, of, markedly, antitrinitarian, protestants, though, the, only, organised, nontrinitarian, churches, were, the, polish, brethren, who, split, from, the, calvinists, 1565, expelled, from, poland, 1658, and, the, unitarian, church, of, transylvania, founded, 1568, nonconformists, dissenters, and, latitudinarians, in, britain, were, often, arians, or, unitarians, and, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, act, 1813, allowed, nontrinitarian, worship, in, britain, in, america, arian, and, unitarian, views, were, also, found, among, some, millennialist, and, adventist, groups, though, the, unitarian, church, itself, began, to, decline, in, numbers, and, influence, after, the, 1870s, nontrinitarian, christians, with, arian, or, semi, arian, views, contend, that, the, weight, of, scriptural, evidence, supports, subordinationism, the, son, s, total, submission, to, the, father, and, god, s, paternal, supremacy, over, the, son, in, every, aspect, they, acknowledge, the, son, s, high, rank, at, god, s, right, hand, but, teach, that, the, father, is, still, greater, than, the, son, in, all, things, while, acknowledging, that, the, father, son, and, spirit, are, essential, in, creation, and, salvation, they, argue, that, that, in, itself, does, not, confirm, that, the, three, are, each, co, equal, or, co, eternal, they, also, affirm, that, god, is, only, explicitly, identified, as, one, in, the, bible, and, that, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, which, word, literally, meaning, a, set, of, three, ascribes, a, co, equal, threeness, to, the, being, of, the, infinite, god, that, is, not, explicitly, scriptural, critics, of, the, trinity, doctrine, argue, that, for, a, teaching, described, as, fundamental, it, lacks, direct, scriptural, support, proponents, of, the, doctrine, assert, that, although, the, doctrine, is, not, stated, directly, in, the, new, testament, it, is, instead, an, interpretation, of, elements, contained, therein, that, imply, the, doctrine, that, was, later, formulated, in, the, 4th, century, william, barclay, a, church, of, scotland, minister, stated, that, it, is, important, and, helpful, to, remember, that, the, word, trinity, is, not, itself, a, new, testament, word, it, is, even, true, in, at, least, one, sense, to, say, that, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, not, directly, new, testament, doctrine, it, is, rather, a, deduction, from, and, an, interpretation, of, the, thought, and, the, language, of, the, new, testament, the, new, catholic, encyclopedia, states, the, doctrine, of, the, holy, trinity, is, not, taught, in, the, the, formulation, one, god, in, three, persons, was, not, solidly, established, prior, to, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, similarly, encyclopedia, encarta, states, the, doctrine, is, not, taught, explicitly, in, the, new, testament, where, the, word, god, almost, invariably, refers, to, the, father, the, term, trinitas, was, first, used, in, the, 2nd, century, by, the, latin, theologian, tertullian, but, the, concept, was, developed, in, the, course, of, the, debates, on, the, nature, of, christ, in, the, 4th, century, the, doctrine, was, finally, formulated, encyclop, dia, britannica, says, neither, the, word, trinity, nor, the, explicit, doctrine, appears, in, the, new, testament, nor, did, jesus, and, his, followers, intend, to, contradict, the, shema, in, the, old, testament, hear, o, israel, the, lord, our, god, is, one, lord, deuteronomy, 6, 4, the, doctrine, developed, gradually, over, several, centuries, and, through, many, controversies, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, under, the, leadership, of, basil, of, caesarea, gregory, of, nyssa, and, gregory, of, nazianzus, the, cappadocian, fathers, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, took, substantially, the, form, it, has, maintained, ever, since, the, anchor, bible, dictionary, states, one, does, not, find, in, the, nt, the, trinitarian, paradox, of, the, coexistence, of, the, father, son, and, spirit, within, a, divine, unity, catholic, historian, joseph, f, kelly, speaking, of, legitimate, theological, development, writes, the, bible, may, not, use, the, word, trinity, but, it, refers, to, god, the, father, frequently, the, gospel, of, john, emphasized, the, divinity, of, the, son, several, new, testament, books, treat, the, holy, spirit, as, divine, the, ancient, theologians, did, not, violate, biblical, teaching, but, sought, to, develop, its, implications, potent, arguments, forced, other, christians, to, refine, their, thinking, about, the, trinity, at, two, ecumenical, councils, nicea, i, in, 325, and, constantinople, i, in, 381, the, church, at, large, defined, the, trinity, in, the, way, now, so, familiar, to, us, from, the, nicene, creed, this, exemplifies, development, of, doctrine, at, its, best, the, bible, may, not, use, the, word, trinity, but, trinitarian, theology, does, not, go, against, the, bible, on, the, contrary, catholics, believe, that, trinitarianism, has, carefully, developed, a, biblical, teaching, for, later, generations, american, catholic, priest, and, trinitarian, r, e, brown, 1928, 1988, wrote, a, journal, article, that, sorted, relevant, biblical, verses, into, three, classes, he, described, the, following, block, as, texts, that, seem, to, imply, that, the, title, god, was, not, used, for, jesus, and, are, negative, evidence, which, is, often, somewhat, neglected, in, catholic, treatments, of, the, subject, he, lists, these, as, texts, where, by, reason, of, textual, variants, or, syntax, the, use, of, god, for, jesus, is, dubious, and, only, finds, the, following, three, as, texts, where, clearly, jesus, is, called, god, the, septuagint, translate, elohim, as, theos, at, deuteronomy, 6, 4, the, shema, yisrael, quoted, by, jesus, at, mark, 12, 29, the, plural, form, of, the, hebrew, word, god, elohim, is, used, generally, understood, to, denote, majesty, excellence, and, the, superlative, it, has, been, stated, that, in, the, original, greek, in, mark, 12, 29, there, are, no, plural, modifiers, in, that, greek, word, there, for, one, heis, but, that, in, mark, 12, it, is, simply, a, masculine, singular, one, and, that, because, of, that, there, is, no, valid, reason, to, believe, that, the, hebrew, word, for, one, in, deuteronomy, 6, echad, was, necessarily, a, plural, one, rather, than, just, simply, numerical, one, at, deuteronomy, 6, 4, the, tetragrammaton, appears, twice, in, this, verse, leading, jehovah, s, witnesses, and, certain, jewish, scholars, to, conclude, that, belief, in, a, singular, and, therefore, indivisible, supremely, powerful, god, is, essential, to, the, shema, in, matthew, 26, 39, jesus, prays, with, a, distinction, between, god, and, himself, o, my, father, if, it, be, possible, let, this, cup, pass, from, me, nevertheless, not, as, i, will, but, as, thou, wilt, in, john, 1, 1, there, is, a, distinction, between, god, and, the, logos, non, trinitarians, claim, a, mistranslation, of, the, second, part, of, john, 1, 1, which, when, literally, translated, word, for, word, reads, and, the, word, was, with, the, god, trinitarians, contend, that, the, third, part, of, the, verse, john, 1, 1c, translates, as, and, the, word, was, god, pointing, to, a, distinction, as, subjects, between, god, and, the, logos, but, an, equivalence, in, nature, some, nontrinitarians, assert, that, the, koine, greek, kai, theos, n, ho, logos, should, be, translated, as, and, a, god, was, the, word, or, and, the, word, was, a, god, based, on, their, contention, that, the, article, of, theos, is, anarthrous, lacking, a, definite, article, they, believe, the, verse, refers, to, jesus, pre, human, existence, as, a, god, or, a, divine, one, as, distinct, from, the, god, nontrinitarians, also, contend, that, the, author, of, john, s, gospel, could, have, written, kai, ho, theos, n, ho, logos, and, the, word, was, the, god, if, that, were, his, intended, meaning, john, 10, 30, nontrinitarians, such, as, arians, believe, that, when, jesus, said, i, and, the, father, are, one, he, did, not, mean, that, they, were, actually, one, substance, or, one, god, or, co, equal, and, co, eternal, but, rather, that, he, and, the, father, have, a, unity, of, purpose, and, that, the, context, indicates, that, jesus, was, saying, that, they, were, one, in, pastoral, work, the, point, being, that, the, father, and, the, son, were, united, in, the, divine, work, of, saving, the, sheep, nontrinitarian, christians, also, cite, john, 17, 21, wherein, jesus, prayed, regarding, his, disciples, that, they, may, all, be, one, as, you, father, are, in, me, and, i, in, you, that, they, may, be, in, us, adding, that, they, may, be, one, even, as, we, are, one, they, argue, that, the, same, greek, word, hen, for, one, throughout, john, 17, indicates, that, jesus, did, not, expect, for, his, followers, to, literally, become, a, single, being, or, one, in, substance, with, each, other, or, with, god, and, therefore, that, jesus, also, did, not, expect, his, hearers, to, think, that, he, and, god, the, father, were, one, entity, either, while, trinitarians, often, use, john, 10, 33, as, proof, for, the, divinity, of, jesus, unitarian, critics, argue, that, the, pharisees, accusing, jesus, of, making, himself, god, shouldn, t, be, the, center, of, attention, when, reading, this, passage, instead, they, emphasize, that, jesus, response, to, the, accusations, in, john, 10, 34, 36, is, of, much, greater, concern, in, fact, he, refuses, to, be, god, but, instead, claims, to, be, the, son, of, god, and, makes, a, direct, reference, to, psalms, 82, 6, in, which, god, calls, his, children, gods, without, taking, away, from, his, own, glory, john, 20, 28, 29, and, thomas, answered, and, said, to, him, my, lord, and, my, god, jesus, said, to, him, thomas, because, you, have, seen, me, you, have, believed, blessed, are, those, who, have, not, seen, and, yet, have, believed, since, thomas, called, jesus, god, jesus, s, statement, appears, to, endorse, thomas, s, assertion, nontrinitarians, sometimes, respond, that, it, is, plausible, that, thomas, is, addressing, the, lord, jesus, and, then, the, father, another, possible, answer, is, that, jesus, himself, said, is, it, not, written, in, your, law, i, said, ye, are, gods, john, 10, 34, referring, to, psalm, 82, 6, 8, the, word, gods, in, verse, 6, and, god, in, verse, 8, is, the, same, hebrew, word, elohim, which, means, gods, in, the, ordinary, sense, but, specifically, used, in, the, plural, thus, especially, with, the, article, of, the, supreme, god, occasionally, applied, by, way, of, deference, to, magistrates, and, sometimes, as, a, superlative, and, can, also, refer, to, powers, and, potentates, in, general, or, as, god, god, gods, rulers, judges, or, angels, and, as, divine, ones, goddess, godlike, one, therefore, the, point, being, that, jesus, was, a, power, or, mighty, one, to, the, apostles, as, the, resurrected, messiah, and, as, the, reflection, of, god, the, father, 2, corinthians, 13, 14, the, grace, of, the, lord, jesus, christ, and, the, love, of, god, and, the, sharing, in, the, holy, spirit, be, with, all, of, you, it, is, argued, by, trinitarians, that, the, appearance, of, father, son, and, spirit, together, in, paul, s, prayer, for, grace, on, all, believers, and, are, considered, essential, for, salvation, that, the, verse, is, consistent, with, a, triune, godhead, nontrinitarians, such, as, arians, reply, that, they, do, not, disagree, that, all, three, are, necessary, for, salvation, and, grace, but, argue, that, the, passage, does, not, explicitly, say, that, all, three, are, co, equal, or, co, eternal, philippians, 2, 5, 6, have, this, mind, among, yourselves, which, is, yours, in, christ, jesus, who, though, he, was, in, the, form, of, god, did, not, count, equality, with, god, a, thing, to, be, grasped, esv, the, word, translated, in, the, english, standard, version, as, a, thing, to, be, grasped, is, other, translations, of, the, word, are, indicated, in, the, holman, christian, standard, bible, make, your, own, attitude, that, of, christ, jesus, who, existing, in, the, form, of, god, did, not, consider, equality, with, god, as, something, to, be, used, for, his, own, advantage, the, king, james, version, has, let, this, mind, be, in, you, which, was, also, in, christ, jesus, who, being, in, the, form, of, god, thought, it, not, robbery, to, be, equal, with, god, nontrinitarians, make, the, argument, that, the, passage, is, simply, saying, that, christ, did, not, consider, equality, with, god, something, graspable, and, that, better, english, translations, make, it, clearer, another, point, is, that, the, original, greek, had, no, definite, article, for, form, of, god, which, would, mean, a, form, of, divinity, and, also, that, the, term, morphe, for, form, in, koine, greek, would, simply, mean, a, general, external, quality, or, station, but, not, necessarily, the, absolute, thing, itself, and, therefore, they, argue, that, the, passage, does, not, explicitly, teach, either, co, equality, co, eternity, or, consubstantiality, hebrews, 9, 14, how, much, more, will, the, blood, of, christ, who, through, an, eternal, spirit, offered, himself, without, blemish, to, god, cleanse, our, consciences, from, dead, works, that, we, may, render, sacred, service, to, the, living, god, most, nontrinitarians, agree, that, the, holy, spirit, had, no, beginning, but, believe, it, is, not, an, actual, person, nontrinitarians, contend, that, it, is, obvious, that, god, the, father, in, the, passage, is, the, one, who, is, ultimately, reached, and, therefore, is, greater, than, the, other, two, entities, and, that, a, co, equal, trinity, is, not, explicitly, taught, in, the, passage, but, only, inferred, the, term, trinity, is, not, in, the, bible, and, some, nontrinitarians, use, this, as, an, argument, to, state, that, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, relies, on, non, biblical, terminology, and, that, the, number, three, is, never, clearly, associated, with, god, necessarily, other, than, within, the, comma, johanneum, which, is, of, spurious, or, disputed, authenticity, they, argue, that, the, only, number, clearly, unambiguously, ascribed, to, god, in, the, bible, is, one, and, that, the, trinity, literally, meaning, three, in, one, ascribes, a, co, equal, threeness, to, god, that, is, not, explicitly, biblical, nontrinitarians, cite, other, examples, of, terms, or, phrases, not, found, in, the, bible, multiple, persons, in, relation, to, god, the, terms, god, the, son, god, man, god, the, holy, spirit, eternal, son, and, eternally, begotten, while, the, trinitarian, term, hypostasis, is, found, in, the, bible, it, is, used, only, once, in, reference, to, god, where, it, states, that, jesus, is, the, express, image, of, god, s, person, the, bible, does, not, explicitly, use, the, term, in, relation, to, the, holy, spirit, nor, explicitly, mentions, the, son, having, a, distinct, hypostasis, from, the, father, the, first, council, of, nicaea, included, in, its, creed, the, major, term, homoousios, of, the, same, essence, which, was, used, also, by, the, council, of, chalcedon, to, speak, of, a, double, consubstantiality, of, christ, consubstantial, with, the, father, as, touching, his, godhead, and, consubstantial, with, us, as, touching, his, manhood, nontrinitarians, accept, what, pier, franco, beatrice, wrote, the, main, thesis, of, this, paper, is, that, homoousios, came, straight, from, constantine, s, hermetic, background, the, plato, recalled, by, constantine, is, just, a, name, used, to, cover, precisely, the, egyptian, and, hermetic, theology, of, the, consubstantiality, of, the, logos, son, with, the, nous, father, having, recourse, to, a, traditional, apologetic, argument, in, the, years, of, the, outbreak, of, the, arian, controversy, lactantius, might, have, played, a, decisive, role, in, influencing, constantine, s, hermetic, interpretation, of, plato, s, theology, and, consequently, the, emperor, s, decision, to, insert, homoousios, in, the, creed, of, nicaea, trinitarians, see, the, absence, of, the, actual, word, trinity, and, other, trinity, related, terms, in, the, bible, as, no, more, significant, than, the, absence, in, the, bible, of, the, words, monotheism, omnipotence, oneness, pentecostal, apostolic, incarnation, and, even, bible, itself, they, maintain, that, while, the, word, trinity, is, not, in, the, bible, the, substance, or, drift, of, the, doctrine, is, definitely, biblical, if, not, explicitly, than, at, least, implicitly, nontrinitarian, views, about, the, holy, spirit, differ, from, mainstream, christian, doctrine, and, generally, fall, into, several, distinct, categories, most, scriptures, traditionally, used, in, support, of, the, trinity, refer, to, the, father, and, the, son, but, not, to, the, holy, spirit, groups, with, unitarian, theology, such, as, polish, socinians, the, 18th, 19th, century, unitarian, church, and, christadelphians, consider, the, holy, spirit, to, be, an, aspect, of, god, s, power, rather, than, a, person, christadelphians, believe, that, the, phrase, holy, spirit, refers, to, god, s, power, or, character, depending, on, the, context, similarly, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, the, holy, spirit, is, not, an, actual, person, but, is, god, s, active, force, that, he, uses, to, accomplish, his, will, groups, with, binitarian, theology, such, as, armstrongites, believe, that, the, logos, and, god, the, father, are, co, equal, and, co, eternal, but, they, do, not, believe, that, the, holy, spirit, is, an, actual, person, like, the, father, and, the, son, they, believe, the, holy, spirit, is, the, power, mind, or, character, of, god, depending, on, the, context, they, teach, the, holy, spirit, is, the, very, essence, the, mind, life, and, power, of, god, it, is, not, a, being, the, spirit, is, inherent, in, the, father, and, the, son, and, emanates, from, them, throughout, the, entire, universe, oneness, pentecostalism, as, with, other, modalist, groups, teach, that, the, holy, spirit, is, a, mode, of, god, rather, than, a, distinct, or, separate, person, in, the, godhead, and, that, the, holy, spirit, is, another, name, for, god, the, father, according, to, oneness, theology, the, holy, spirit, is, the, father, operating, in, a, certain, capacity, or, manifestation, the, united, pentecostal, church, teaches, that, there, is, no, personal, distinction, between, god, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, the, two, titles, father, and, holy, spirit, as, well, as, others, are, said, to, not, reflect, separate, persons, within, the, godhead, but, rather, two, different, ways, in, which, the, one, god, reveals, himself, to, his, creatures, the, oneness, view, of, bible, verses, that, mention, god, and, his, spirit, e, g, isaiah, 48, 16, is, that, they, do, not, imply, two, persons, any, more, than, various, scriptural, references, to, a, man, and, his, spirit, or, soul, such, as, in, luke, 12, 19, imply, two, persons, existing, within, one, body, in, the, lds, church, the, holy, ghost, usually, synonymous, with, holy, spirit, is, considered, to, be, the, third, distinct, member, of, the, godhead, father, son, and, holy, ghost, and, to, have, a, body, of, spirit, which, makes, him, unlike, the, father, and, the, son, who, are, said, to, have, bodies, as, tangible, as, man, s, according, to, lds, doctrine, the, holy, spirit, is, believed, to, be, a, person, with, a, body, of, spirit, able, to, pervade, all, worlds, latter, day, saints, believe, that, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, ghost, are, part, of, the, godhead, but, that, the, father, is, greater, than, the, son, and, that, the, son, is, greater, than, the, holy, spirit, in, position, and, authority, but, not, in, nature, i, e, they, equally, share, the, god, nature, they, teach, that, the, father, son, and, spirit, are, three, ontologically, separate, self, aware, entities, who, share, a, common, god, nature, distinct, from, our, human, nature, who, are, one, god, in, the, sense, of, being, united, in, the, same, sense, that, a, husband, and, wife, are, said, to, be, one, similar, to, social, trinitarianism, a, number, of, latter, day, saint, sects, most, notably, the, community, of, christ, the, second, largest, latter, day, saint, denomination, the, church, of, christ, temple, lot, and, derived, groups, follow, a, traditional, protestant, trinitarian, theology, the, unity, church, interprets, the, religious, terms, father, son, and, holy, spirit, metaphysically, as, three, aspects, of, mind, action, mind, idea, and, expression, they, believe, this, is, the, process, through, which, all, manifestation, takes, place, groups, in, the, rastafari, movement, generally, state, that, it, is, haile, selassie, who, embodies, both, god, the, father, and, god, the, son, while, the, holy, or, hola, spirit, is, to, be, found, within, every, human, being, rastas, also, say, that, the, true, church, is, the, human, body, and, that, it, is, this, church, or, structure, that, contains, the, holy, spirit, as, the, nicene, creed, s, declaration, of, the, trinity, is, held, as, the, foundational, belief, for, mainstream, christians, nontrinitarian, sects, may, be, regarded, as, cults, or, heresies, by, other, christians, or, accused, of, not, being, christians, at, all, on, the, other, hand, nontrinitarians, may, see, mainstream, christians, as, having, fallen, or, apostasized, from, the, original, christian, church, ecumenism, is, a, type, of, interfaith, dialogue, within, christianity, based, on, shared, essential, core, beliefs, ecumenism, is, usually, built, on, the, basis, of, shared, belief, in, trinitarian, baptism, which, by, definition, excludes, nontrinitarians, this, makes, it, especially, difficult, for, trinitarian, and, nontrinitarian, churches, to, recognize, the, other, side, s, baptisms, and, communions, or, for, them, to, worship, together, however, unity, of, action, on, shared, community, goals, is, easier, to, accomplish, orthodoxy, sets, certain, beliefs, as, correct, by, tradition, beliefs, not, within, those, guidelines, be, designated, heterodox, or, heretical, many, nontrinitarians, believe, that, the, traditions, of, mainstream, christianity, itself, are, incorrect, in, a, great, apostasy, foretold, by, paul, the, catholic, church, has, specifically, designated, many, varieties, of, nontrinitarianism, heresies, including, arianism, modalism, and, tritheism, they, have, also, specifically, named, mormonism, and, jehovah, s, witnesses, as, heresies, as, well, as, protestantism, and, calvinism, fundamentalist, or, evangelical, protestantism, has, also, targeted, some, nontrinitarians, as, part, of, the, christian, countercult, movement, however, more, cautious, authors, argue, that, strange, beliefs, alone, are, not, enough, to, designate, a, cult, the, group, s, behavior, is, a, more, important, factor, pentecostalism, has, a, peculiar, relationship, with, ecumenism, there, is, a, theological, division, between, oneness, and, trinitarian, pentecostals, and, ecumenical, groups, within, pentecostalism, tend, to, follow, those, lines, however, many, pentecostals, think, of, ecumenism, less, as, a, need, for, a, formal, cooperative, institution, between, groups, and, more, as, a, spiritual, experience, in, addition, many, pentecostal, believers, are, insufficiently, focused, on, abstract, theology, to, identify, as, trinitarian, or, nontrinitarian, mormonism, particularly, its, largest, sect, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, has, a, complex, relationship, with, mainstream, christianity, due, in, part, to, its, nontrinitarianism, it, also, has, other, unusual, doctrines, which, lead, many, evangelical, christians, to, challenge, its, inclusion, within, christianity, mormonism, s, second, largest, sect, the, community, of, christ, is, a, trinitarian, group, and, participates, in, a, variety, of, ecumenical, organizations, such, as, the, national, council, of, churches, of, christ, ecumenical, and, interfaith, ministries, community, of, christ, the, trinity, doctrine, is, integral, in, inter, religious, disagreements, with, the, other, two, main, abrahamic, religions, judaism, and, islam, the, former, rejects, jesus, divine, mission, entirely, and, the, latter, accepts, jesus, as, a, human, prophet, and, the, messiah, but, not, as, the, son, of, god, although, accepting, virgin, birth, the, rejection, of, the, trinity, doctrine, has, led, to, comparisons, between, nontrinitarian, theology, and, judaism, and, islam, in, an, 1897, article, in, the, jewish, quarterly, review, montefiore, describes, unitarianism, as, a, bridge, between, judaism, and, mainstream, christianity, calling, it, both, a, phase, of, judaism, and, a, phase, of, christianity, in, islam, the, concept, of, a, co, equal, trinity, is, totally, rejected, with, quranic, verses, calling, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, blasphemous, early, islam, was, originally, seen, as, a, variant, of, arianism, a, heresy, in, orthodox, and, catholic, christianity, by, the, byzantine, emperor, in, the, 600s, in, the, 700s, many, arians, in, spain, considered, muhammad, a, prophet, in, the, mid, 1500s, many, socinian, unitarians, were, suspected, of, having, islamic, leanings, socinians, praised, islam, though, considering, the, qur, an, to, contain, errors, for, its, belief, in, the, unity, of, god, bilal, cleland, claimed, that, an, anonymous, writer, in, a, letter, of, resolution, concerning, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, and, incarnation, 1693, states, that, islam, s, greater, number, of, adherents, and, military, supremacy, resulted, from, more, closely, maintaining, correct, doctrine, than, mainstream, christianity, some, nontrinitarians, also, say, that, a, link, between, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, and, the, egyptian, christian, theologians, of, alexandria, suggests, that, alexandrian, theology, with, its, strong, emphasis, on, the, deity, of, jesus, served, to, infuse, egypt, s, pagan, religious, heritage, into, christianity, they, accuse, the, church, of, adopting, these, egyptian, tenets, after, adapting, them, to, christian, thinking, by, means, of, greek, philosophy, they, say, the, development, of, the, idea, of, a, co, equal, triune, godhead, was, based, on, pagan, greek, and, platonic, influence, including, many, basic, concepts, from, aristotelian, philosophy, incorporated, into, the, biblical, god, as, an, example, they, mention, that, aristotle, stated, all, things, are, three, and, thrice, is, all, and, let, us, use, this, number, in, the, worship, of, the, gods, for, as, pythagoreans, say, everything, and, all, things, are, bound, by, threes, for, the, end, the, middle, and, the, beginning, have, this, number, in, everything, and, these, compose, the, number, of, the, trinity, however, trinitarians, have, argued, that, the, words, attributed, to, aristotle, differ, in, a, number, of, ways, from, what, has, been, published, as, the, philosopher, s, original, text, in, greek, which, omits, let, us, use, this, number, in, the, worship, of, the, gods, and, are, not, supported, by, translations, of, the, works, of, aristotle, by, scholars, such, as, stuart, leggatt, w, k, c, guthrie, j, l, stocks, thomas, taylor, and, jules, barth, lemy, saint, hilaire, some, anti, trinitarians, note, also, that, the, greek, philosopher, plato, believed, in, a, special, threeness, in, life, and, in, the, universe, in, phaedo, he, introduces, the, word, triad, in, greek, which, is, rendered, in, english, as, trinity, this, was, adopted, by, 3rd, and, 4th, century, professed, christians, as, roughly, corresponding, to, father, word, and, spirit, soul, nontrinitarian, christians, contend, that, such, notions, and, adoptions, make, the, trinity, doctrine, extra, biblical, they, say, there, is, a, widely, acknowledged, synthesis, of, christianity, with, platonic, philosophy, evident, in, trinitarian, formulas, appearing, by, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, they, allege, that, beginning, with, the, constantinian, period, these, pagan, ideas, were, forcibly, imposed, on, the, churches, as, catholic, doctrine, most, groups, subscribing, to, the, theory, of, a, great, apostasy, generally, concur, in, this, thesis, the, early, apologists, including, justin, martyr, tertullian, and, irenaeus, frequently, discussed, the, parallels, and, contrasts, between, christianity, paganism, and, other, syncretic, religions, and, answered, charges, of, borrowing, from, paganism, in, their, apologetical, writings, stuart, g, hall, formerly, professor, of, ecclesiastical, history, at, king, s, college, london, describes, the, subsequent, process, of, philosophical, theological, amalgamation, in, doctrine, and, practice, in, the, early, church, 1991, where, he, writes, the, apologists, began, to, claim, that, greek, culture, pointed, to, and, was, consummated, in, the, christian, message, just, as, the, old, testament, was, this, process, was, done, most, thoroughly, in, the, synthesis, of, clement, of, alexandria, it, can, be, done, in, several, ways, you, can, rake, through, greek, literature, and, find, especially, in, the, oldest, seers, and, poets, references, to, god, which, are, more, compatible, with, monotheism, than, with, polytheism, so, at, length, athenagoras, you, can, work, out, a, common, chronology, between, the, legends, of, prehistoric, homer, greece, and, the, biblical, record, so, theophilus, you, can, adapt, a, piece, of, pre, christian, jewish, apologetic, which, claimed, that, plato, and, other, greek, philosophers, got, their, best, ideas, indirectly, from, the, teachings, of, moses, in, the, bible, which, was, much, earlier, this, theory, combines, the, advantage, of, making, out, the, greeks, to, be, plagiarists, and, therefore, second, rate, or, criminal, while, claiming, that, they, support, christianity, by, their, arguments, at, least, some, of, the, time, especially, this, applied, to, the, question, of, god, the, neo, platonic, trinities, such, as, that, of, the, one, the, nous, and, the, soul, are, not, considered, a, trinity, necessarily, of, consubstantial, equals, as, in, mainstream, christianity, however, the, neo, platonic, trinity, has, the, doctrine, of, emanation, or, eternal, derivation, a, timeless, procedure, of, generation, having, as, a, source, the, one, and, claimed, to, be, paralleled, with, the, generation, of, the, light, from, the, sun, this, was, adopted, by, origen, and, later, on, by, athanasius, and, applied, to, the, generation, of, the, son, from, the, father, because, they, believed, that, this, analogy, could, be, used, to, support, the, notion, that, the, father, as, immutable, always, had, been, a, father, and, that, the, generation, of, the, son, is, therefore, eternal, and, timeless, the, synthesis, of, christianity, with, platonic, philosophy, was, further, incorporated, in, the, trinitarian, formulas, that, appeared, by, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, the, greek, philosophical, theology, was, developed, during, the, trinitarian, controversies, over, the, relationships, among, the, persons, of, the, godhead, the, allegation, of, borrowing, was, raised, by, some, disputants, when, the, nicene, doctrine, was, being, formalized, and, adopted, by, the, bishops, for, example, in, the, 4th, century, marcellus, of, ancyra, who, taught, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, were, one, person, hypostasis, said, in, his, on, the, holy, church, 9, now, with, the, heresy, of, the, ariomaniacs, which, has, corrupted, the, church, of, god, these, then, teach, three, hypostases, just, as, valentinus, the, heresiarch, first, invented, in, the, book, entitled, by, him, on, the, three, natures, for, he, was, the, first, to, invent, three, hypostases, and, three, persons, of, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, and, he, is, discovered, to, have, filched, this, from, hermes, and, plato, in, his, introduction, to, the, 1964, book, meditations, the, anglican, priest, maxwell, staniforth, discussed, the, profound, influence, of, stoic, philosophy, on, christianity, in, particular, again, in, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, the, ecclesiastical, conception, of, father, word, and, spirit, finds, its, germ, in, the, different, stoic, names, of, the, divine, unity, thus, seneca, writing, of, the, supreme, power, which, shapes, the, universe, states, this, power, we, sometimes, call, the, all, ruling, god, sometimes, the, incorporeal, wisdom, sometimes, the, holy, spirit, sometimes, destiny, the, church, had, only, to, reject, the, last, of, these, terms, to, arrive, at, its, own, acceptable, definition, of, the, divine, nature, while, the, further, assertion, these, three, are, one, which, the, modern, mind, finds, paradoxical, was, no, more, than, commonplace, to, those, familiar, with, stoic, notions
