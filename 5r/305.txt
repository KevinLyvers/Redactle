religious, practices, in, ancient, greece, encompassed, a, collection, of, beliefs, rituals, and, mythology, in, the, form, of, both, popular, public, religion, and, cult, practices, the, application, of, the, modern, concept, of, religion, to, ancient, cultures, has, been, questioned, as, anachronistic, the, ancient, greeks, did, not, have, a, word, for, religion, in, the, modern, sense, likewise, no, greek, writer, known, to, us, classifies, either, the, gods, or, the, cult, practices, into, separate, religions, instead, for, example, herodotus, speaks, of, the, hellenes, as, having, common, shrines, of, the, gods, and, sacrifices, and, the, same, kinds, of, customs, most, ancient, greeks, recognized, the, twelve, major, olympian, gods, and, goddesses, zeus, hera, poseidon, demeter, athena, ares, aphrodite, apollo, artemis, hephaestus, hermes, and, either, hestia, or, dionysus, although, philosophies, such, as, stoicism, and, some, forms, of, platonism, used, language, that, seems, to, assume, a, single, transcendent, deity, the, worship, of, these, deities, and, several, others, was, found, across, the, greek, world, though, they, often, have, different, epithets, that, distinguished, aspects, of, the, deity, and, often, reflect, the, absorption, of, other, local, deities, into, the, pan, hellenic, scheme, the, religious, practices, of, the, greeks, extended, beyond, mainland, greece, to, the, islands, and, coasts, of, ionia, in, asia, minor, to, magna, graecia, sicily, and, southern, italy, and, to, scattered, greek, colonies, in, the, western, mediterranean, such, as, massalia, marseille, early, italian, religions, such, as, the, etruscan, religion, were, influenced, by, greek, religion, and, subsequently, influenced, much, of, the, ancient, roman, religion, there, was, no, centralization, of, authority, over, greek, religious, practices, and, beliefs, change, was, regulated, only, at, the, civic, level, thus, the, phenomenon, we, are, studying, is, not, in, fact, an, organized, religion, instead, we, might, think, of, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, greeks, in, relation, to, the, gods, as, a, group, of, closely, related, religious, dialects, that, resembled, each, other, far, more, than, they, did, those, of, non, greeks, ancient, greek, theology, was, polytheistic, based, on, the, assumption, that, there, were, many, gods, and, goddesses, as, well, as, a, range, of, lesser, supernatural, beings, of, various, types, there, was, a, hierarchy, of, deities, with, zeus, the, king, of, the, gods, having, a, level, of, control, over, all, the, others, although, he, was, not, almighty, some, deities, had, dominion, over, certain, aspects, of, nature, for, instance, zeus, was, the, sky, god, sending, thunder, and, lightning, poseidon, ruled, over, the, sea, and, earthquakes, hades, projected, his, remarkable, power, throughout, the, realms, of, death, and, the, underworld, and, helios, controlled, the, sun, other, deities, ruled, over, abstract, concepts, for, instance, aphrodite, controlled, love, all, significant, deities, were, visualized, as, human, in, form, although, often, able, to, transform, themselves, into, animals, or, natural, phenomena, while, being, immortal, the, gods, were, certainly, not, all, good, or, even, all, powerful, they, had, to, obey, fate, known, to, greek, mythology, as, the, moirai, which, overrode, any, of, their, divine, powers, or, wills, for, instance, in, mythology, it, was, odysseus, fate, to, return, home, to, ithaca, after, the, trojan, war, and, the, gods, could, only, lengthen, his, journey, and, make, it, harder, for, him, not, stop, him, the, gods, had, human, vices, and, many, behaved, with, arguably, less, morality, than, a, typical, human, they, interacted, with, humans, sometimes, even, spawning, children, called, demigods, with, them, at, times, certain, gods, would, be, opposed, to, others, and, they, would, try, to, outdo, each, other, in, the, iliad, aphrodite, ares, and, apollo, support, the, trojan, side, in, the, trojan, war, while, hera, athena, and, poseidon, support, the, greeks, see, theomachy, some, gods, were, specifically, associated, with, a, certain, city, athena, was, associated, with, athens, apollo, with, delphi, and, delos, zeus, with, olympia, and, aphrodite, with, corinth, but, other, gods, were, also, worshipped, in, these, cities, other, deities, were, associated, with, nations, outside, of, greece, poseidon, was, associated, with, ethiopia, and, troy, and, ares, with, thrace, identity, of, names, was, not, a, guarantee, of, a, similar, cultus, the, greeks, themselves, were, well, aware, that, the, artemis, worshipped, at, sparta, the, virgin, huntress, was, a, very, different, deity, from, the, artemis, who, was, a, many, breasted, fertility, goddess, at, ephesus, though, worship, of, the, major, deities, spread, from, one, locality, to, another, and, though, most, larger, cities, had, temples, to, several, major, gods, the, identification, of, different, gods, with, different, places, remained, strong, to, the, end, ancient, sources, for, greek, religion, tell, a, good, deal, about, cult, but, very, little, about, creed, in, no, small, measure, because, the, greeks, in, general, considered, what, one, believed, to, be, much, less, importance, than, what, one, did, the, greeks, believed, in, an, underworld, inhabited, by, the, spirits, of, the, dead, one, of, the, most, widespread, areas, of, this, underworld, was, ruled, by, hades, a, brother, of, zeus, and, was, also, known, as, hades, originally, called, the, place, of, hades, other, well, known, realms, are, tartarus, a, place, of, torment, for, the, damned, and, elysium, a, place, of, pleasures, for, the, virtuous, in, the, early, mycenaean, religion, all, the, dead, went, to, hades, but, the, rise, of, mystery, cults, in, the, archaic, age, led, to, the, development, of, places, such, as, tartarus, and, elysium, a, few, greeks, like, achilles, alcmene, amphiaraus, ganymede, ino, melicertes, menelaus, peleus, and, a, great, number, of, those, who, fought, in, the, trojan, and, theban, wars, were, considered, to, have, been, physically, immortalized, and, brought, to, live, forever, in, either, elysium, the, islands, of, the, blessed, heaven, the, ocean, or, beneath, the, ground, such, beliefs, are, found, in, the, most, ancient, greek, sources, such, as, homer, and, hesiod, this, belief, remained, strong, even, into, the, christian, era, for, most, people, at, the, moment, of, death, there, was, however, no, hope, of, anything, but, continued, existence, as, a, disembodied, soul, some, greeks, such, as, the, philosophers, pythagoras, and, plato, also, embraced, the, idea, of, reincarnation, though, this, was, only, accepted, by, a, few, epicurus, taught, that, the, soul, was, simply, atoms, which, were, dissolved, at, death, so, one, ceased, to, exist, on, dying, greek, religion, had, an, extensive, mythology, it, consisted, largely, of, stories, of, the, gods, and, how, they, interacted, with, humans, myths, often, revolved, around, heroes, and, their, actions, such, as, heracles, and, his, twelve, labors, odysseus, and, his, voyage, home, jason, and, the, quest, for, the, golden, fleece, and, theseus, and, the, minotaur, many, species, existed, in, greek, mythology, chief, among, these, were, the, gods, and, humans, though, the, titans, who, predated, the, olympian, gods, also, frequently, appeared, in, greek, myths, lesser, species, included, the, half, man, half, horse, centaurs, the, nature, based, nymphs, tree, nymphs, were, dryads, sea, nymphs, were, nereids, and, the, half, man, half, goat, satyrs, some, creatures, in, greek, mythology, were, monstrous, such, as, the, one, eyed, giant, cyclopes, the, sea, beast, scylla, whirlpool, charybdis, gorgons, and, the, half, man, half, bull, minotaur, there, was, no, set, greek, cosmogony, or, creation, myth, different, religious, groups, believed, that, the, world, had, been, created, in, different, ways, one, greek, creation, myth, was, told, in, hesiod, s, theogony, it, stated, that, at, first, there, was, only, a, primordial, deity, called, chaos, after, which, came, various, other, primordial, gods, such, as, gaia, tartarus, and, eros, who, then, gave, birth, to, more, gods, the, titans, who, then, gave, birth, to, the, first, olympians, the, mythology, largely, survived, and, was, expanded, to, form, the, later, roman, mythology, the, greeks, and, romans, were, literate, societies, and, much, mythology, although, initially, shared, orally, was, written, down, in, the, forms, of, epic, poetry, such, as, the, iliad, the, odyssey, and, the, argonautica, and, plays, such, as, euripides, the, bacchae, and, aristophanes, the, frogs, the, mythology, became, popular, in, christian, post, renaissance, europe, where, it, was, often, used, as, a, basis, for, the, works, of, artists, like, botticelli, michelangelo, and, rubens, one, of, the, most, important, moral, concepts, to, the, greeks, was, aversion, to, hubris, hubris, constituted, many, things, from, rape, to, desecration, of, a, corpse, and, was, a, crime, in, athens, although, pride, and, vanity, were, not, considered, sins, themselves, the, greeks, emphasized, moderation, pride, only, became, hubris, when, it, went, to, extremes, like, any, other, vice, the, same, was, thought, of, eating, and, drinking, anything, done, to, excess, was, not, considered, proper, ancient, greeks, placed, for, example, importance, on, athletics, and, intellect, equally, in, fact, many, of, their, competitions, included, both, pride, was, not, evil, until, it, became, all, consuming, or, hurtful, to, others, the, greeks, had, no, religious, texts, they, regarded, as, revealed, scriptures, of, sacred, origin, but, very, old, texts, including, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, and, the, homeric, hymns, regarded, as, later, productions, today, hesiod, s, theogony, and, works, and, days, and, pindar, s, odes, were, regarded, as, authoritative, and, perhaps, inspired, they, usually, begin, with, an, invocation, to, the, muses, for, inspiration, plato, even, wanted, to, exclude, the, myths, from, his, ideal, state, described, in, the, republic, because, of, their, low, moral, tone, while, some, traditions, such, as, mystery, cults, upheld, certain, texts, as, canonic, within, their, praxis, such, texts, were, respected, but, not, necessarily, accepted, as, canonic, outside, their, circle, in, this, field, of, particular, importance, are, certain, texts, referring, to, orphic, cults, multiple, copies, ranging, from, between, 450, bce, and, 250, ce, have, been, found, in, various, parts, of, the, greek, world, even, the, words, of, the, oracles, never, became, a, sacred, text, other, texts, were, specially, composed, for, religious, events, and, some, have, survived, within, the, lyric, tradition, although, they, had, a, cult, function, they, were, bound, to, performance, and, never, developed, into, a, common, standard, prayer, form, comparable, to, the, christian, pater, noster, an, exception, to, this, rule, were, the, already, named, orphic, and, mystery, rituals, which, in, this, set, themselves, aside, from, the, rest, of, the, greek, religious, system, finally, some, texts, called, ieri, logi, greek, sacred, texts, by, the, ancient, sources, originated, from, outside, the, greek, world, or, were, supposedly, adopted, in, remote, times, representing, yet, more, different, traditions, within, the, greek, belief, system, the, lack, of, a, unified, priestly, class, meant, that, a, unified, canonic, form, of, the, religious, texts, or, practices, never, existed, just, as, there, was, no, unified, common, sacred, text, for, the, greek, belief, system, there, was, no, standardization, of, practices, instead, religious, practices, were, organized, on, local, levels, with, priests, normally, being, magistrates, for, the, city, or, village, or, gaining, authority, from, one, of, the, many, sanctuaries, pausanias, notes, that, the, priest, of, the, temple, of, athena, alea, at, tegea, was, a, boy, who, held, office, only, until, reaching, the, age, of, puberty, some, priestly, functions, like, the, care, for, a, particular, local, festival, could, be, given, by, tradition, to, a, certain, family, to, a, large, extent, in, the, absence, of, scriptural, sacred, texts, religious, practices, derived, their, authority, from, tradition, and, every, omission, or, deviation, arouses, deep, anxiety, and, calls, forth, sanctions, greek, ceremonies, and, rituals, were, mainly, performed, at, altars, which, were, never, inside, temples, but, often, just, outside, or, standing, by, themselves, somewhere, these, were, typically, devoted, to, one, or, a, few, gods, and, supported, a, statue, of, the, particular, deity, votive, deposits, were, left, at, the, altar, such, as, food, drinks, as, well, as, precious, objects, sometimes, animal, sacrifices, were, performed, here, with, most, of, the, flesh, taken, for, eating, and, the, offal, burnt, as, an, offering, to, the, gods, libations, often, of, wine, would, be, offered, to, the, gods, as, well, not, only, at, shrines, but, also, in, everyday, life, such, as, during, a, symposium, one, rite, of, passage, was, the, amphidromia, celebrated, on, the, fifth, or, seventh, day, after, the, birth, of, a, child, childbirth, was, extremely, significant, to, athenians, especially, if, the, baby, was, a, boy, one, ceremony, was, pharmakos, a, ritual, involving, expelling, a, symbolic, scapegoat, such, as, a, slave, or, an, animal, from, a, city, or, village, in, a, time, of, hardship, it, was, hoped, that, by, casting, out, the, ritual, scapegoat, the, hardship, would, go, with, it, worship, in, greece, typically, consisted, of, sacrificing, domestic, animals, at, the, altar, with, hymn, and, prayer, the, altar, was, outside, any, temple, building, and, might, not, be, associated, with, a, temple, at, all, the, animal, which, should, be, perfect, of, its, kind, was, decorated, with, garlands, and, the, like, and, led, in, procession, to, the, altar, a, girl, with, a, basket, on, her, head, containing, the, concealed, knife, led, the, way, after, various, rituals, the, animal, was, slaughtered, over, the, altar, as, it, fell, all, the, women, present, out, in, high, shrill, tones, its, blood, was, collected, and, poured, over, the, altar, it, was, butchered, on, the, spot, and, various, internal, organs, bones, and, other, inedible, parts, burnt, as, the, deity, s, portion, of, the, offering, while, the, meat, was, removed, to, be, prepared, for, the, participants, to, eat, the, leading, figures, tasted, it, on, the, spot, the, temple, usually, kept, the, skin, to, sell, to, tanners, that, humans, got, more, use, from, the, sacrifice, than, the, deity, did, not, escape, the, greeks, and, was, often, the, subject, of, humor, in, greek, comedy, the, animals, used, were, in, order, of, preference, bulls, or, oxen, cows, sheep, the, most, common, sacrifice, goats, pigs, with, piglets, being, the, cheapest, mammal, and, poultry, but, rarely, other, birds, or, fish, horses, and, asses, are, seen, on, some, vases, in, the, geometric, style, 900, 750, bce, but, are, very, rarely, mentioned, in, literature, they, were, relatively, late, introductions, to, greece, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, greek, preferences, in, this, matter, were, established, earlier, the, greeks, liked, to, believe, that, the, animal, was, glad, to, be, sacrificed, and, interpreted, various, behaviors, as, showing, this, divination, by, examining, parts, of, the, sacrificed, animal, was, much, less, important, than, in, roman, or, etruscan, religion, or, near, eastern, religions, but, was, practiced, especially, of, the, liver, and, as, part, of, the, cult, of, apollo, generally, the, greeks, put, more, faith, in, observing, the, behavior, of, birds, for, a, smaller, and, simpler, offering, a, grain, of, incense, could, be, thrown, on, the, sacred, fire, and, outside, the, cities, farmers, made, simple, sacrificial, gifts, of, plant, produce, as, the, first, fruits, were, harvested, the, libation, a, ritual, pouring, of, fluid, was, part, of, everyday, life, and, libations, with, a, prayer, were, often, made, at, home, whenever, wine, was, drunk, with, just, a, part, of, the, cup, s, contents, the, rest, being, drunk, more, formal, ones, might, be, made, onto, altars, at, temples, and, other, fluids, such, as, olive, oil, and, honey, might, be, used, although, the, grand, form, of, sacrifice, called, the, hecatomb, meaning, 100, bulls, might, in, practice, only, involve, a, dozen, or, so, at, large, festivals, the, number, of, cattle, sacrificed, could, run, into, the, hundreds, and, the, numbers, feasting, on, them, well, into, the, thousands, the, evidence, of, the, existence, of, such, practices, is, clear, in, some, ancient, greek, literature, especially, homer, s, epics, throughout, the, poems, the, use, of, the, ritual, is, apparent, at, banquets, where, meat, is, served, in, times, of, danger, or, before, some, important, endeavor, to, gain, the, gods, favor, for, example, in, the, odyssey, eumaeus, sacrifices, a, pig, with, prayer, for, his, unrecognizable, master, odysseus, but, in, the, iliad, which, partly, reflects, very, early, greek, civilization, not, every, banquet, of, the, princes, begins, with, a, sacrifice, these, sacrificial, practices, share, much, with, recorded, forms, of, sacrificial, rituals, known, from, later, furthermore, throughout, the, poem, special, banquets, are, held, whenever, gods, indicated, their, presence, by, some, sign, or, success, in, war, before, setting, out, for, troy, this, type, of, animal, sacrifice, is, offered, odysseus, offers, zeus, a, sacrificial, ram, in, vain, the, occasions, of, sacrifice, in, homer, s, epic, poems, may, shed, some, light, onto, the, view, of, gods, as, members, of, society, rather, than, external, entities, indicating, social, ties, sacrificial, rituals, played, a, major, role, in, forming, the, relationship, between, humans, and, the, divine, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, chthonic, deities, distinguished, from, olympic, deities, by, typically, being, offered, the, holocaust, mode, of, sacrifice, where, the, offering, is, wholly, burnt, may, be, remnants, of, the, native, pre, hellenic, religion, and, that, many, of, the, olympian, deities, may, come, from, the, proto, greeks, who, overran, the, southern, part, of, the, balkan, peninsula, in, the, late, third, millennium, bce, various, religious, festivals, were, held, in, ancient, greece, many, were, specific, only, to, a, particular, deity, or, city, state, for, example, the, festival, of, lykaia, was, celebrated, in, arcadia, in, greece, which, was, dedicated, to, the, pastoral, god, pan, like, the, other, panhellenic, games, the, ancient, olympic, games, were, a, religious, festival, held, at, the, sanctuary, of, zeus, at, olympia, other, festivals, centered, on, greek, theatre, of, which, the, dionysia, in, athens, was, the, most, important, more, typical, festivals, featured, a, procession, large, sacrifices, and, a, feast, to, eat, the, offerings, and, many, included, entertainments, and, customs, such, as, visiting, friends, wearing, fancy, dress, and, unusual, behavior, in, the, streets, sometimes, risky, for, bystanders, in, various, ways, altogether, the, year, in, athens, included, some, 140, days, that, were, religious, festivals, of, some, sort, though, they, varied, greatly, in, importance, the, main, greek, temple, building, sat, within, a, larger, precinct, or, temenos, usually, surrounded, by, a, peribolos, fence, or, wall, the, whole, is, usually, called, a, sanctuary, the, acropolis, of, athens, is, the, most, famous, example, though, this, was, apparently, walled, as, a, citadel, before, a, temple, was, ever, built, there, the, tenemos, might, include, many, subsidiary, buildings, sacred, groves, or, springs, animals, dedicated, to, the, deity, and, sometimes, people, who, had, taken, sanctuary, from, the, law, which, some, temples, offered, for, example, to, runaway, slaves, the, earliest, greek, sanctuaries, probably, lacked, temple, buildings, though, our, knowledge, of, these, is, limited, and, the, subject, is, controversial, a, typical, early, sanctuary, seems, to, have, consisted, of, a, tenemos, often, around, a, sacred, grove, cave, rock, baetyl, or, spring, and, perhaps, defined, only, by, marker, stones, at, intervals, with, an, altar, for, offerings, many, rural, sanctuaries, probably, stayed, in, this, style, but, the, more, popular, were, gradually, able, to, afford, a, building, to, house, a, cult, image, especially, in, cities, this, process, was, certainly, under, way, by, the, 9th, century, and, probably, started, earlier, the, temple, interiors, did, not, serve, as, meeting, places, since, the, sacrifices, and, rituals, dedicated, to, the, respective, deity, took, place, outside, them, at, altars, within, the, wider, precinct, of, the, sanctuary, which, might, be, large, as, the, centuries, passed, both, the, inside, of, popular, temples, and, the, area, surrounding, them, accumulated, statues, and, small, shrines, or, other, buildings, as, gifts, and, military, trophies, paintings, and, items, in, precious, metals, effectively, turning, them, into, a, type, of, museum, some, sanctuaries, offered, oracles, people, who, were, believed, to, receive, divine, inspiration, in, answering, questions, put, by, pilgrims, the, most, famous, of, these, by, far, was, the, female, priestess, called, the, pythia, at, the, temple, of, apollo, at, delphi, and, that, of, zeus, at, dodona, but, there, were, many, others, some, dealt, only, with, medical, agricultural, or, other, specialized, matters, and, not, all, represented, gods, like, that, of, the, hero, trophonius, at, livadeia, the, temple, was, the, house, of, the, deity, it, was, dedicated, to, who, in, some, sense, resided, in, the, cult, image, in, the, cella, or, main, room, inside, normally, facing, the, only, door, the, cult, image, normally, took, the, form, of, a, statue, of, the, deity, typically, roughly, life, size, but, in, some, cases, many, times, life, size, in, early, days, these, were, in, wood, marble, or, terracotta, or, in, the, specially, prestigious, form, of, a, chryselephantine, statue, using, ivory, plaques, for, the, visible, parts, of, the, body, and, gold, for, the, clothes, around, a, wooden, framework, the, most, famous, greek, cult, images, were, of, this, type, including, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, and, phidias, s, athena, parthenos, in, the, parthenon, in, athens, both, colossal, statues, now, completely, lost, fragments, of, two, chryselephantine, statues, from, delphi, have, been, excavated, bronze, cult, images, were, less, frequent, at, least, until, hellenistic, times, early, images, seem, often, to, have, been, dressed, in, real, clothes, and, at, all, periods, images, might, wear, real, jewelry, donated, by, devotees, the, acrolith, was, another, composite, form, this, time, a, cost, saving, one, with, a, wooden, body, a, xoanon, was, a, primitive, and, symbolic, wooden, image, perhaps, comparable, to, the, hindu, lingam, many, of, these, were, retained, and, revered, for, their, antiquity, even, when, a, new, statue, was, the, main, cult, image, xoana, had, the, advantage, that, they, were, easy, to, carry, in, processions, at, festivals, the, trojan, palladium, famous, from, the, myths, of, the, epic, cycle, and, supposedly, ending, up, in, rome, was, one, of, these, the, sacred, boulder, or, baetyl, is, another, very, primitive, type, found, around, the, mediterranean, and, ancient, near, east, many, of, the, greek, statues, well, known, from, roman, marble, copies, were, originally, temple, cult, images, which, in, some, cases, such, as, the, apollo, barberini, can, be, credibly, identified, a, very, few, actual, originals, survive, for, example, the, bronze, piraeus, athena, 2, 35, m, 7, 7, ft, high, including, a, helmet, the, image, stood, on, a, base, from, the, 5th, century, often, carved, with, reliefs, it, used, to, be, thought, that, access, to, the, cella, of, a, greek, temple, was, limited, to, the, priests, and, it, was, entered, only, rarely, by, other, visitors, except, perhaps, during, important, festivals, or, other, special, occasions, in, recent, decades, this, picture, has, changed, and, scholars, now, stress, the, variety, of, local, access, rules, pausanias, was, a, gentlemanly, traveller, of, the, 2nd, century, ce, who, declares, that, the, special, intention, of, his, travels, around, greece, was, to, see, cult, images, and, usually, managed, to, do, so, it, was, typically, necessary, to, make, a, sacrifice, or, gift, and, some, temples, restricted, access, either, to, certain, days, of, the, year, or, by, class, race, gender, with, either, men, or, women, forbidden, or, even, more, tightly, garlic, eaters, were, forbidden, in, one, temple, in, another, women, unless, they, were, virgins, restrictions, typically, arose, from, local, ideas, of, ritual, purity, or, a, perceived, whim, of, the, deity, in, some, places, visitors, were, asked, to, show, they, spoke, greek, elsewhere, dorians, were, not, allowed, entry, some, temples, could, only, be, viewed, from, the, threshold, some, temples, are, said, never, to, be, opened, at, all, but, generally, greeks, including, slaves, had, a, reasonable, expectation, of, being, allowed, into, the, cella, once, inside, the, cella, it, was, possible, to, pray, to, or, before, the, cult, image, and, sometimes, to, touch, it, cicero, saw, a, bronze, image, of, heracles, with, its, foot, largely, worn, away, by, the, touch, of, devotees, famous, cult, images, such, as, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, functioned, as, significant, visitor, attractions, in, addition, to, the, role, that, women, performed, in, sacrifices, the, only, public, roles, that, greek, women, could, perform, were, priestesses, either, hiereiai, meaning, sacred, women, or, amphipolis, a, term, for, lesser, attendants, as, priestesses, they, gained, social, recognition, and, access, to, more, luxuries, than, other, greek, women, who, worked, or, stayed, in, the, home, they, were, mostly, from, local, elite, families, some, roles, required, virgins, who, typically, only, served, for, a, year, or, so, before, marriage, while, other, roles, went, to, married, women, women, who, voluntarily, chose, to, become, priestesses, received, an, increase, in, social, and, legal, status, to, the, public, and, after, death, they, received, a, public, burial, site, greek, priestesses, had, to, be, healthy, and, of, a, sound, mind, the, reasoning, being, that, the, ones, serving, the, gods, had, to, be, as, high, quality, as, their, offerings, this, was, also, true, of, male, greek, priests, it, is, contested, whether, there, were, gendered, divisions, when, it, came, to, serving, a, particular, god, or, goddess, who, was, devoted, to, what, god, gods, and, or, goddesses, could, have, both, priests, and, priestesses, to, serve, them, gender, specifics, did, come, into, play, when, it, came, to, who, would, perform, certain, acts, of, sacrifice, or, worship, per, the, significance, of, the, male, or, female, role, to, a, particular, god, or, goddess, a, priest, would, lead, the, priestess, or, the, reverse, in, some, greek, cults, priestesses, served, both, gods, and, goddesses, pythia, or, female, oracle, of, apollo, at, delphi, and, that, at, didyma, were, priestesses, but, both, were, overseen, by, male, priests, the, festival, of, dionosyus, was, practiced, by, both, and, the, god, was, served, by, women, and, female, priestesses, known, as, the, gerarai, or, the, venerable, ones, there, were, segregated, religious, festivals, in, ancient, greece, the, thesmophoria, plerosia, kalamaia, adonia, and, skira, were, festivals, that, were, only, for, women, the, thesmophoria, festival, and, many, others, represented, agricultural, fertility, which, was, considered, to, be, closely, connected, to, women, it, gave, women, a, religious, identity, and, purpose, in, greek, religion, in, which, the, role, of, women, in, worshipping, goddesses, demeter, and, her, daughter, persephone, reinforced, traditional, lifestyles, the, festivals, relating, to, agricultural, fertility, were, valued, by, the, polis, because, this, is, what, they, traditionally, worked, for, women, centered, festivals, that, involved, private, matters, were, less, important, in, athens, the, festivals, honoring, demeter, were, included, in, the, calendar, and, promoted, by, athens, they, constructed, temples, and, shrines, like, the, thesmophorion, where, women, could, perform, their, rites, and, worship, those, who, were, not, satisfied, by, the, public, cult, of, the, gods, could, turn, to, various, mystery, religions, that, operated, as, cults, into, which, members, had, to, be, initiated, in, order, to, learn, their, secrets, here, they, could, find, religious, consolations, that, traditional, religion, could, not, provide, a, chance, at, mystical, awakening, a, systematic, religious, doctrine, a, map, to, the, afterlife, a, communal, worship, and, a, band, of, spiritual, fellowship, some, of, these, mysteries, like, the, mysteries, of, eleusis, and, samothrace, were, ancient, and, local, others, were, spread, from, place, to, place, like, the, mysteries, of, dionysus, during, the, hellenistic, period, and, the, roman, empire, exotic, mystery, religions, became, widespread, not, only, in, greece, but, all, across, the, empire, some, of, these, were, new, creations, such, as, mithras, while, others, had, been, practiced, for, hundreds, of, years, before, like, the, egyptian, mysteries, of, osiris, mainstream, greek, religion, appears, to, have, developed, out, of, proto, indo, european, religion, and, although, very, little, is, known, about, the, earliest, periods, there, are, suggestive, hints, that, some, local, elements, go, back, even, further, than, the, bronze, age, or, helladic, period, to, the, farmers, of, neolithic, greece, there, was, also, clearly, cultural, evolution, from, the, late, helladic, mycenaean, religion, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, both, the, literary, settings, of, some, important, myths, and, many, important, sanctuaries, relate, to, locations, that, were, important, helladic, centers, that, had, become, otherwise, unimportant, by, greek, times, the, mycenaeans, perhaps, treated, poseidon, to, them, a, god, of, earthquakes, as, well, as, the, sea, as, their, chief, deity, and, forms, of, his, name, along, with, several, other, olympians, are, recognizable, in, records, in, linear, b, while, apollo, and, aphrodite, are, absent, only, about, half, of, the, mycenaean, pantheon, seems, to, survive, the, greek, dark, ages, the, archaeological, evidence, for, continuity, in, religion, is, far, clearer, for, crete, and, cyprus, than, the, greek, mainland, greek, religious, concepts, may, also, have, absorbed, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, earlier, nearby, cultures, such, as, minoan, religion, and, other, influences, came, from, the, near, east, especially, via, cyprus, and, phoenicia, herodotus, writing, in, the, 5th, century, bce, traced, many, greek, religious, practices, to, egypt, robert, g, boling, argues, that, greek, and, ugaritic, canaanite, mythology, share, many, parallel, relationships, and, that, historical, trends, in, canaanite, religion, can, help, date, works, such, as, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, the, great, goddess, hypothesis, that, a, stone, age, religion, dominated, by, a, female, great, goddess, was, displaced, by, a, male, dominated, indo, european, hierarchy, has, been, proposed, for, greece, as, for, minoan, crete, and, other, regions, but, has, not, been, in, favor, with, specialists, for, some, decades, though, the, question, remains, too, poorly, evidenced, for, a, clear, conclusion, at, the, least, the, evidence, from, minoan, art, shows, more, goddesses, than, gods, the, twelve, olympians, with, zeus, as, sky, father, certainly, have, a, strong, indo, european, flavor, by, the, time, of, the, epic, works, of, homer, all, are, well, established, except, for, dionysus, but, several, of, the, homeric, hymns, probably, composed, slightly, later, are, dedicated, to, him, archaic, and, classical, greece, saw, the, development, of, flourishing, cities, and, of, stone, built, temples, to, the, gods, which, were, rather, consistent, in, design, across, the, greek, world, religion, was, closely, tied, to, civic, life, and, priests, were, mostly, drawn, from, the, local, elite, religious, works, led, the, development, of, greek, sculpture, though, apparently, not, the, now, vanished, greek, painting, while, much, religious, practice, was, as, well, as, personal, aimed, at, developing, solidarity, within, the, polis, a, number, of, important, sanctuaries, developed, a, panhellenic, status, drawing, visitors, from, all, over, the, greek, world, these, served, as, an, essential, component, in, the, growth, and, self, consciousness, of, greek, nationalism, the, mainstream, religion, of, the, greeks, did, not, go, unchallenged, within, greece, as, greek, philosophy, developed, its, ideas, about, ethics, the, olympians, were, found, wanting, several, notable, philosophers, criticized, belief, in, the, gods, the, earliest, of, these, was, xenophanes, who, chastised, the, gods, human, vices, and, their, anthropomorphic, depiction, plato, wrote, that, there, was, one, supreme, god, whom, he, called, the, form, of, the, good, which, he, believed, was, the, emanation, of, perfection, in, the, universe, plato, s, disciple, aristotle, also, disagreed, that, polytheistic, deities, existed, because, he, could, not, find, enough, empirical, evidence, for, it, he, believed, in, a, prime, mover, which, had, set, creation, going, but, was, not, connected, to, or, interested, in, the, universe, in, the, hellenistic, period, between, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bce, and, the, roman, conquest, of, greece, 146, bce, greek, religion, developed, in, various, ways, including, expanding, over, at, least, some, of, alexander, s, conquests, the, new, dynasties, of, diadochi, kings, and, tyrants, often, spent, lavishly, on, temples, often, following, alexander, in, trying, to, insinuate, themselves, into, religious, cult, this, was, much, easier, for, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, of, egypt, where, the, traditional, ancient, egyptian, religion, had, long, had, deified, monarchs, the, enormous, raised, pergamon, altar, now, in, berlin, and, the, altar, of, hieron, in, sicily, are, examples, of, unprecedentedly, large, constructions, of, the, period, new, cults, of, imported, deities, such, as, isis, from, egypt, atargatis, from, syria, and, cybele, from, anatolia, became, increasingly, important, as, well, as, several, philosophical, movements, such, as, platonism, stoicism, and, epicureanism, both, tended, to, detract, from, the, traditional, religion, although, many, greeks, were, able, to, hold, beliefs, from, more, than, one, of, these, groups, serapis, was, essentially, a, hellenistic, creation, if, not, devised, then, spread, in, egypt, for, political, reasons, by, ptolemy, i, soter, as, a, hybrid, of, greek, and, local, styles, of, deity, various, philosophical, movements, including, the, orphics, and, pythagoreans, began, to, question, the, ethics, of, animal, sacrifice, and, whether, the, gods, really, appreciated, it, from, the, surviving, texts, empedocles, and, theophrastus, both, vegetarians, were, notable, critics, hellenistic, astrology, developed, late, in, the, period, as, another, distraction, from, the, traditional, practices, although, traditional, myths, festivals, and, beliefs, all, continued, these, trends, probably, reduced, the, grip, on, the, imagination, of, the, traditional, pantheon, especially, among, the, educated, but, also, in, the, general, population, when, the, roman, republic, conquered, greece, in, 146, bce, it, took, much, of, greek, religion, along, with, many, other, aspects, of, greek, culture, such, as, literary, and, architectural, styles, and, incorporated, it, into, its, own, the, greek, gods, were, equated, with, the, ancient, roman, deities, zeus, with, jupiter, hera, with, juno, poseidon, with, neptune, aphrodite, with, venus, ares, with, mars, artemis, with, diana, athena, with, minerva, hermes, with, mercury, hephaestus, with, vulcan, hestia, with, vesta, demeter, with, ceres, hades, with, pluto, tyche, with, fortuna, and, pan, with, faunus, some, of, the, gods, such, as, apollo, and, bacchus, had, earlier, been, adopted, by, the, romans, there, were, also, many, deities, that, existed, in, the, roman, religion, before, its, interaction, with, greece, that, were, not, associated, with, a, greek, deity, including, janus, and, quirinus, the, romans, generally, did, not, spend, much, on, new, temples, in, greece, other, than, those, for, their, imperial, cult, which, were, placed, in, all, important, cities, exceptions, include, antoninus, pius, r, 138, 161, ce, whose, commissions, include, the, baalbec, temple, of, bacchus, arguably, the, most, impressive, survival, from, the, imperial, period, though, the, temple, of, jupiter, baal, next, to, it, was, larger, it, could, be, said, the, greek, world, was, by, this, time, well, furnished, with, sanctuaries, roman, governors, and, emperors, often, pilfered, famous, statues, from, sanctuaries, sometimes, leaving, contemporary, reproductions, in, their, place, verres, governor, of, sicily, from, 73, to, 70, bce, was, an, early, example, who, unusually, was, prosecuted, after, his, departure, after, the, huge, roman, conquests, beyond, greece, new, cults, from, egypt, and, asia, became, popular, in, greece, as, well, as, the, western, empire, the, initial, decline, of, greco, roman, polytheism, was, due, in, part, to, its, syncretic, nature, assimilating, beliefs, and, practices, from, a, variety, of, foreign, religious, traditions, as, the, roman, empire, expanded, greco, roman, philosophical, schools, incorporated, elements, of, judaism, and, early, christianity, and, mystery, religions, like, christianity, and, mithraism, also, became, increasingly, popular, constantine, i, became, the, first, roman, emperor, to, convert, to, christianity, and, the, edict, of, milan, in, 313, ce, enacted, official, tolerance, for, christianity, within, the, empire, still, in, greece, and, elsewhere, there, is, evidence, that, pagan, and, christian, communities, remained, essentially, segregated, from, each, other, with, little, mutual, cultural, influence, urban, pagans, continued, to, use, the, civic, centers, and, temple, complexes, while, christians, set, up, their, own, new, places, of, worship, in, suburban, areas, contrary, to, some, older, scholarship, newly, converted, christians, did, not, simply, continue, worshiping, in, converted, temples, rather, new, christian, communities, formed, as, older, pagan, communities, declined, and, were, eventually, suppressed, and, disbanded, the, roman, emperor, julian, a, nephew, of, constantine, initiated, an, effort, to, end, the, ascension, of, christianity, within, the, empire, and, reorganize, a, syncretic, version, of, greco, roman, polytheism, that, he, termed, hellenism, later, known, as, the, apostate, julian, had, been, raised, christian, but, embraced, his, ancestors, paganism, in, early, adulthood, taking, notice, of, how, christianity, ultimately, flourished, under, suppression, julian, pursued, a, policy, of, marginalization, but, not, destruction, towards, the, church, tolerating, and, at, times, lending, state, support, to, other, prominent, faiths, particularly, judaism, when, he, believed, doing, so, would, be, likely, to, weaken, christianity, julian, s, christian, training, influenced, his, decision, to, create, a, single, organized, version, of, the, various, old, pagan, traditions, with, a, centralized, priesthood, and, a, coherent, body, of, doctrine, ritual, and, liturgy, based, on, neoplatonism, on, the, other, hand, julian, forbade, christian, educators, from, utilizing, many, of, the, great, works, of, philosophy, and, literature, associated, with, greco, roman, paganism, he, believed, christianity, had, benefited, significantly, from, not, only, access, to, but, influence, over, classical, education, julian, s, successors, jovian, valentinian, i, and, valens, continued, julian, s, policy, of, religious, toleration, within, the, empire, garnering, them, both, praise, from, pagan, writers, official, persecution, of, paganism, in, the, eastern, empire, began, under, theodosius, i, in, 381, ce, theodosius, strictly, enforced, anti, pagan, laws, had, priesthoods, disbanded, temples, destroyed, and, actively, participated, in, christian, actions, against, pagan, holy, sites, he, enacted, laws, that, prohibited, worship, of, pagan, gods, not, only, in, public, but, also, within, private, homes, the, last, olympic, games, were, held, in, 393, ce, and, theodosius, likely, suppressed, any, further, attempts, to, hold, the, games, western, empire, emperor, gratian, under, the, influence, of, his, adviser, ambrose, ended, the, widespread, unofficial, tolerance, that, had, existed, in, the, western, roman, empire, since, the, reign, of, julian, in, 382, ce, gratian, appropriated, the, income, and, property, of, the, remaining, orders, of, pagan, priests, disbanded, the, vestal, virgins, removed, altars, and, confiscated, temples, despite, official, suppression, by, the, roman, government, worship, of, the, greco, roman, gods, persisted, in, some, rural, and, remote, regions, into, the, early, middle, ages, a, claimed, temple, to, apollo, with, a, community, of, worshipers, and, associated, sacred, grove, survived, at, monte, cassino, until, 529, ce, when, it, was, forcefully, converted, to, a, christian, chapel, by, saint, benedict, of, nursia, who, destroyed, the, altar, and, cut, down, the, grove, other, pagan, communities, namely, the, maniots, persisted, in, the, mani, peninsula, of, greece, until, at, least, the, 9th, century, greek, religion, and, philosophy, have, experienced, a, number, of, revivals, firstly, in, the, arts, humanities, and, spirituality, of, renaissance, neoplatonism, which, many, believed, had, effects, in, the, real, world, during, the, period, 14th, 17th, centuries, when, ancient, greek, literature, and, philosophy, gained, widespread, appreciation, in, europe, this, new, popularity, did, not, extend, to, ancient, greek, religion, especially, the, original, theist, forms, and, most, new, examinations, of, greek, philosophy, were, written, in, a, solidly, christian, context, early, revivalists, with, varying, degrees, of, commitment, were, the, englishmen, john, fransham, 1730, 1810, interested, in, neoplatonism, and, thomas, taylor, 1758, 1835, who, produced, the, first, english, translations, of, many, neoplatonic, philosophical, and, religious, texts, more, recently, a, revival, has, begun, with, contemporary, hellenism, as, it, is, often, called, in, greece, the, term, is, hellenic, national, religion, modern, hellenism, reflects, neoplatonic, and, platonic, speculation, represented, in, porphyry, libanius, proclus, and, julian, as, well, as, classical, cult, practice, but, it, has, far, fewer, followers, than, greek, orthodox, christianity, according, to, estimates, reported, by, the, u, s, state, department, in, 2006, there, were, perhaps, as, many, as, 2, 000, followers, of, the, ancient, greek, religion, out, of, a, total, greek, population, of, 11, million, but, hellenism, s, leaders, place, that, figure, at, 100, 000
