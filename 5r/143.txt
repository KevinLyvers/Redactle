a, cemetery, burial, ground, gravesite, graveyard, or, a, green, space, called, a, memorial, park, is, a, place, where, the, remains, of, dead, people, are, buried, or, otherwise, interred, the, word, cemetery, from, greek, sleeping, place, implies, that, the, land, is, specifically, designated, as, a, burial, ground, and, originally, applied, to, the, roman, catacombs, the, term, graveyard, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, cemetery, but, a, graveyard, primarily, refers, to, a, burial, ground, within, a, churchyard, the, intact, or, cremated, remains, of, people, may, be, interred, in, a, grave, commonly, referred, to, as, burial, or, in, a, tomb, an, above, ground, grave, resembling, a, sarcophagus, a, mausoleum, a, columbarium, a, niche, or, another, edifice, in, western, cultures, funeral, ceremonies, are, often, observed, in, cemeteries, these, ceremonies, or, rites, of, passage, differ, according, to, cultural, practices, and, religious, beliefs, modern, cemeteries, often, include, crematoria, and, some, grounds, previously, used, for, both, continue, as, crematoria, as, a, principal, use, long, after, the, interment, areas, have, been, filled, the, taforalt, cave, in, morocco, is, possibly, the, oldest, known, cemetery, in, the, world, it, was, the, resting, place, of, at, least, 34, iberomaurusian, individuals, the, bulk, of, whom, have, been, dated, to, 15, 100, to, 14, 000, years, ago, neolithic, cemeteries, are, sometimes, referred, to, by, the, term, grave, field, they, are, one, of, the, chief, sources, of, information, on, ancient, and, prehistoric, cultures, and, numerous, archaeological, cultures, are, defined, by, their, burial, customs, such, as, the, urnfield, culture, of, the, european, bronze, age, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, reopening, of, graves, and, manipulation, of, the, corpses, or, artifacts, contained, within, them, was, a, widespread, phenomenon, and, a, common, part, of, the, life, course, of, early, medieval, cemeteries, across, western, and, central, europe, the, reopening, of, furnished, or, recent, burials, occurred, over, the, broad, zone, of, european, row, grave, style, furnished, inhumation, burial, especially, from, the, 5th, to, the, 8th, centuries, ce, which, comprised, the, regions, of, today, s, romania, hungary, the, czech, republic, slovakia, switzerland, austria, germany, the, low, countries, france, and, south, eastern, england, from, about, the, 7th, century, ce, in, europe, a, burial, was, under, the, control, of, the, church, and, could, only, take, place, on, consecrated, church, ground, practices, varied, but, in, continental, europe, bodies, were, usually, buried, in, a, mass, grave, until, they, had, decomposed, the, bones, were, then, exhumed, and, stored, in, ossuaries, either, along, the, arcaded, bounding, walls, of, the, cemetery, or, within, the, church, under, floor, slabs, and, behind, walls, in, most, cultures, those, who, were, vastly, rich, had, important, professions, were, part, of, the, nobility, or, were, of, any, other, high, social, status, were, usually, buried, in, individual, crypts, inside, or, beneath, the, relevant, place, of, worship, with, an, indication, of, their, name, date, of, death, and, other, biographical, data, in, europe, this, was, often, accompanied, by, a, depiction, of, their, coat, of, arms, most, others, were, buried, in, graveyards, again, divided, by, social, status, mourners, who, could, afford, the, work, of, a, stonemason, had, a, headstone, engraved, with, a, name, dates, of, birth, and, death, and, sometimes, other, biographical, data, and, set, up, over, the, place, of, burial, usually, the, more, writing, and, symbols, carved, on, the, headstone, the, more, expensive, it, was, as, with, most, other, human, property, such, as, houses, and, means, of, transport, richer, families, used, to, compete, for, the, artistic, value, of, their, family, headstone, in, comparison, to, others, around, it, sometimes, adding, a, statue, such, as, a, weeping, angel, on, the, top, of, the, grave, those, who, could, not, pay, for, a, headstone, at, all, usually, had, some, religious, symbol, made, from, wood, on, the, place, of, burial, such, as, a, christian, cross, however, this, would, quickly, deteriorate, under, the, rain, or, snow, some, families, hired, a, blacksmith, and, had, large, crosses, made, from, various, metals, put, on, the, places, of, burial, starting, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, burial, of, the, dead, in, graveyards, began, to, be, discontinued, due, to, rapid, population, growth, in, the, early, stages, of, the, industrial, revolution, continued, outbreaks, of, infectious, disease, near, graveyards, and, the, increasingly, limited, space, in, graveyards, for, new, interments, in, many, european, states, burial, in, graveyards, was, eventually, outlawed, altogether, through, legislation, instead, of, graveyards, completely, new, places, of, burial, were, established, away, from, heavily, populated, areas, and, outside, of, old, towns, and, city, centers, many, new, cemeteries, became, municipally, owned, or, were, run, by, their, own, corporations, and, thus, independent, from, churches, and, their, churchyards, in, some, cases, skeletons, were, exhumed, from, graveyards, and, moved, into, ossuaries, or, catacombs, a, large, action, of, this, type, occurred, in, 18th, century, paris, when, human, remains, were, transferred, from, graveyards, all, over, the, city, to, the, catacombs, of, paris, the, bones, of, an, estimated, six, million, people, are, to, be, found, there, an, early, example, of, a, landscape, style, cemetery, is, p, re, lachaise, in, paris, this, embodied, the, idea, of, state, rather, than, church, controlled, burial, a, concept, that, spread, through, the, continent, of, europe, with, the, napoleonic, invasions, this, could, include, the, opening, of, cemeteries, by, private, or, joint, stock, companies, the, shift, to, municipal, cemeteries, or, those, established, by, private, companies, was, usually, accompanied, by, the, establishing, of, landscaped, burial, grounds, outside, the, city, e, g, extramural, in, britain, the, movement, was, driven, by, dissenters, and, public, health, concerns, the, rosary, cemetery, in, norwich, was, opened, in, 1819, as, a, burial, ground, for, all, religious, backgrounds, similar, private, non, denominational, cemeteries, were, established, near, industrialising, towns, with, growing, populations, such, as, manchester, 1821, and, liverpool, 1825, each, cemetery, required, a, separate, act, of, parliament, for, authorisation, although, the, capital, was, raised, through, the, formation, of, joint, stock, companies, in, the, first, 50, years, of, the, 19th, century, the, population, of, london, more, than, doubled, from, 1, million, to, 2, 3, million, the, small, parish, churchyards, were, rapidly, becoming, dangerously, overcrowded, and, decaying, matter, infiltrating, the, water, supply, was, causing, epidemics, the, issue, became, particularly, acute, after, the, cholera, epidemic, of, 1831, which, killed, 52, 000, people, in, britain, alone, putting, unprecedented, pressure, on, the, country, s, burial, capacity, concerns, were, also, raised, about, the, potential, public, health, hazard, arising, from, the, inhalation, of, gases, generated, from, human, putrefaction, under, the, then, prevailing, miasma, theory, of, disease, legislative, action, was, slow, in, coming, but, in, 1832, parliament, finally, acknowledged, the, need, for, the, establishment, of, large, municipal, cemeteries, and, encouraged, their, construction, outside, london, the, same, bill, also, closed, all, inner, london, churchyards, to, new, deposits, the, magnificent, seven, seven, large, cemeteries, around, london, were, established, in, the, following, decade, starting, with, kensal, green, in, 1832, urban, planner, and, author, john, claudius, loudon, was, one, of, the, first, professional, cemetery, designers, and, his, book, on, the, laying, out, planting, and, managing, of, cemeteries, 1843, was, very, influential, on, designers, and, architects, of, the, period, loudon, himself, designed, three, cemeteries, bath, abbey, cemetery, histon, road, cemetery, cambridge, and, southampton, old, cemetery, the, metropolitan, burial, act, of, 1852, legislated, for, the, establishment, of, the, first, national, system, of, government, funded, municipal, cemeteries, across, the, country, opening, the, way, for, a, massive, expansion, of, burial, facilities, throughout, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, united, states, rural, cemeteries, became, recreational, areas, in, a, time, before, public, parks, hosting, events, from, casual, picnics, to, hunts, and, carriage, races, there, are, a, number, of, different, styles, of, cemetery, in, use, many, cemeteries, have, areas, based, on, different, styles, reflecting, the, diversity, of, cultural, practices, around, death, and, how, it, changes, over, time, the, urban, cemetery, is, a, burial, ground, located, in, the, interior, of, a, village, town, or, city, early, urban, cemeteries, were, churchyards, which, filled, quickly, and, exhibited, a, haphazard, placement, of, burial, markers, as, sextons, tried, to, squeeze, new, burials, into, the, remaining, space, as, new, burying, grounds, were, established, in, urban, areas, to, compensate, burial, plots, were, often, laid, out, in, a, grid, to, replace, the, chaotic, appearance, of, the, churchyard, urban, cemeteries, developed, over, time, into, a, more, landscaped, form, as, part, of, civic, development, of, beliefs, and, institutions, that, sought, to, portray, the, city, as, civilized, and, harmonious, urban, cemeteries, were, more, sanitary, a, place, to, safely, dispose, of, decomposing, corpses, than, they, were, aesthetically, pleasing, corpses, were, usually, buried, wrapped, in, cloth, since, coffins, burial, vaults, and, above, ground, crypts, inhibited, the, process, of, decomposition, nonetheless, urban, cemeteries, which, were, heavily, used, were, often, very, unhealthy, receiving, vaults, and, crypts, often, needed, to, be, aired, before, entering, as, decomposing, corpses, used, up, so, much, oxygen, that, even, candles, could, not, remain, lit, the, sheer, stench, from, decomposing, corpses, even, when, buried, deeply, was, overpowering, in, areas, adjacent, to, the, urban, cemetery, decomposition, of, the, human, body, releases, significant, pathogenic, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and, viruses, which, can, cause, disease, and, illness, and, many, urban, cemeteries, were, located, without, consideration, for, local, groundwater, modern, burials, in, urban, cemeteries, also, release, toxic, chemicals, associated, with, embalming, such, as, arsenic, formaldehyde, and, mercury, coffins, and, burial, equipment, can, also, release, significant, amounts, of, toxic, chemicals, such, as, arsenic, used, to, preserve, coffin, wood, and, formaldehyde, used, in, varnishes, and, as, a, sealant, and, toxic, metals, such, as, copper, lead, and, zinc, from, coffin, handles, and, flanges, urban, cemeteries, relied, heavily, on, the, fact, that, the, soft, parts, of, the, body, would, decompose, in, about, 25, years, although, in, moist, soil, decomposition, can, take, up, to, 70, years, if, room, for, new, burials, was, needed, older, bones, could, be, dug, up, and, interred, elsewhere, such, as, in, an, ossuary, to, make, space, for, new, interments, it, was, not, uncommon, in, some, places, such, as, england, for, fresher, corpses, to, be, chopped, up, to, aid, decomposition, and, for, bones, to, be, burned, to, create, fertilizer, the, re, use, of, graves, allowed, for, a, steady, stream, of, income, which, enabled, the, cemetery, to, remain, well, maintained, and, in, good, repair, not, all, urban, cemeteries, engaged, in, re, use, of, graves, and, cultural, taboos, often, prevented, it, many, urban, cemeteries, have, fallen, into, disrepair, and, become, overgrown, as, they, lacked, endowments, to, fund, perpetual, care, many, urban, cemeteries, today, are, thus, home, to, wildlife, birds, and, plants, which, cannot, be, found, anywhere, else, in, the, urban, area, and, many, urban, cemeteries, in, the, late, 20th, century, touted, their, role, as, an, environmental, refuge, many, urban, cemeteries, are, characterized, by, multiple, burials, in, the, same, grave, multiple, burials, is, a, consequence, of, the, limited, size, of, the, urban, cemetery, which, cannot, easily, expand, due, to, adjacent, building, development, it, was, not, uncommon, for, an, urban, cemetery, to, begin, adding, soil, to, the, top, of, the, cemetery, to, create, new, burial, space, a, monumental, cemetery, is, the, traditional, style, of, cemetery, where, headstones, or, other, monuments, made, of, marble, granite, or, similar, materials, rise, vertically, above, the, ground, typically, around, 50, cm, but, some, can, be, over, 2, metres, high, often, the, entire, grave, is, covered, by, a, slab, commonly, concrete, but, it, can, be, more, expensive, materials, such, as, marble, or, granite, and, or, has, its, boundaries, delimited, by, a, fence, which, may, be, made, of, concrete, cast, iron, or, timber, where, a, number, of, family, members, are, buried, together, either, vertically, or, horizontally, the, slab, or, boundaries, may, encompass, a, number, of, graves, monumental, cemeteries, are, often, regarded, as, unsightly, due, to, the, random, collection, of, monuments, and, headstones, they, contain, also, as, maintenance, of, the, headstones, is, the, responsibility, of, family, members, in, the, absence, of, a, proscribed, perpetual, care, and, maintenance, fund, over, time, many, headstones, are, forgotten, about, and, decay, and, become, damaged, for, cemetery, authorities, monumental, cemeteries, are, difficult, to, maintain, while, cemeteries, often, have, grassed, areas, between, graves, the, layout, of, graves, makes, it, difficult, to, use, modern, equipment, such, as, ride, on, lawn, mowers, in, the, cemetery, often, the, maintenance, of, grass, must, be, done, by, more, labour, intensive, and, therefore, expensive, methods, in, order, to, reduce, the, labour, cost, devices, such, as, string, trimmers, are, increasingly, used, in, cemetery, maintenance, but, such, devices, can, damage, the, monuments, and, headstones, cemetery, authorities, dislike, the, criticism, they, receive, for, the, deteriorating, condition, of, the, headstones, arguing, that, they, have, no, responsibility, for, the, upkeep, of, headstones, and, typically, disregard, their, own, maintenance, practices, as, being, one, of, the, causes, of, that, deterioration, the, rural, cemetery, or, garden, cemetery, is, a, style, of, burial, ground, that, uses, landscaping, in, a, park, like, setting, it, was, conceived, in, 1711, by, the, british, architect, sir, christopher, wren, who, advocated, the, creation, of, landscaped, burial, grounds, which, featured, well, planned, walkways, which, gave, extensive, access, to, graves, and, planned, plantings, of, trees, bushes, and, flowers, wren, s, idea, was, not, immediately, accepted, but, by, the, early, 1800s, existing, churchyards, were, growing, overcrowded, and, unhealthy, with, graves, stacked, upon, each, other, or, emptied, and, reused, for, new, burials, as, a, reaction, to, this, the, first, garden, cemetery, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, paris, opened, in, 1804, because, these, cemeteries, were, usually, on, the, outskirts, of, town, where, land, was, plentiful, and, cheap, they, were, called, rural, cemeteries, a, term, still, used, to, describe, them, today, the, concept, quickly, spread, across, europe, garden, rural, cemeteries, were, not, necessarily, outside, city, limits, when, land, within, a, city, could, be, found, the, cemetery, was, enclosed, with, a, wall, to, give, it, a, garden, like, quality, these, cemeteries, were, often, not, sectarian, nor, co, located, with, a, house, of, worship, inspired, by, the, english, landscape, garden, movement, they, often, looked, like, attractive, parks, the, first, garden, rural, cemetery, in, the, united, states, was, mount, auburn, cemetery, near, boston, massachusetts, founded, by, the, massachusetts, horticultural, society, in, 1831, following, the, establishment, of, mount, auburn, dozens, of, other, rural, cemeteries, were, established, in, the, united, states, perhaps, in, part, because, of, supreme, court, justice, joseph, story, s, dedication, address, and, there, were, dozens, of, dedication, addresses, including, the, famous, gettysburg, address, of, president, abraham, lincoln, the, cost, of, building, a, garden, rural, cemetery, often, meant, that, only, the, wealthy, could, afford, burial, there, subsequently, garden, rural, cemeteries, often, feature, above, ground, monuments, and, memorials, mausoleums, and, columbaria, the, excessive, filling, of, rural, garden, cemeteries, with, elaborate, above, ground, memorials, many, of, dubious, artistic, quality, or, taste, created, a, backlash, which, led, to, the, development, of, the, lawn, cemetery, in, a, review, of, british, burial, and, death, practises, julie, rugg, wrote, that, there, were, four, closely, interlinked, factors, that, explain, the, invention, and, widespread, adoption, of, the, lawn, cemetery, the, deterioration, of, the, victorian, cemetery, a, self, conscious, rejection, of, victorian, aesthetics, in, favour, of, modern, alternatives, resource, difficulties, that, particularly, after, world, war, ii, increasingly, constrained, what, might, be, achieved, in, terms, of, cemetery, maintenance, and, growing, professionalism, in, the, field, of, cemetery, management, typically, lawn, cemeteries, comprise, a, number, of, graves, in, a, lawn, setting, with, trees, and, gardens, on, the, perimeter, adolph, strauch, introduced, this, style, in, 1855, in, cincinnati, while, aesthetic, appeal, to, family, members, has, been, the, primary, driver, for, the, development, of, lawn, cemeteries, cemetery, authorities, initially, welcomed, this, new, style, of, cemetery, enthusiastically, expecting, easier, maintenance, selecting, or, grading, the, land, intended, for, a, lawn, cemetery, so, that, it, is, completely, flat, allows, the, use, of, large, efficient, mowers, such, as, ride, on, mowers, or, lawn, tractors, the, plaques, being, horizontally, set, in, the, ground, lie, below, the, level, of, the, blades, and, are, not, damaged, by, the, blades, in, practice, while, families, are, often, initially, attracted, to, the, uncluttered, appearance, of, a, lawn, cemetery, the, common, practice, of, placing, flowers, sometimes, in, vases, and, increasingly, other, items, e, g, small, toys, on, children, s, graves, re, introduces, some, clutter, to, the, cemetery, and, makes, it, difficult, to, use, the, larger, mowers, while, cemetery, authorities, increasingly, impose, restrictions, on, the, nature, and, type, of, objects, that, can, be, placed, on, lawn, graves, and, actively, remove, prohibited, items, grieving, families, are, often, unwilling, to, comply, with, these, restrictions, and, become, very, upset, if, the, items, are, removed, another, problem, with, lawn, cemeteries, involves, grass, over, growth, over, time, the, grass, can, grow, over, and, cover, the, plaque, to, the, distress, of, families, who, can, no, longer, easily, locate, the, grave, grasses, that, propagate, by, an, above, ground, stolon, runner, can, cover, a, plaque, very, quickly, grasses, that, propagate, by, a, below, ground, rhizome, tend, not, to, cover, the, plaque, as, easily, the, lawn, beam, cemetery, a, recent, development, seeks, to, solve, the, problems, of, the, lawn, cemetery, while, retaining, many, of, its, benefits, low, 10, 15, cm, raised, concrete, slabs, beams, are, placed, across, the, cemetery, commemorative, plaques, usually, standardised, in, terms, of, size, and, materials, similar, to, lawn, cemeteries, stand, on, these, beams, adjacent, to, each, grave, as, in, a, lawn, cemetery, grass, grows, over, the, graves, themselves, the, areas, between, the, beams, are, wide, enough, to, permit, easy, mowing, with, a, larger, mower, as, the, mower, blades, are, set, lower, than, the, top, of, the, beam, and, the, mowers, do, not, go, over, the, beam, the, blades, cannot, damage, the, plaques, up, on, the, beam, the, plaques, cannot, be, easily, overgrown, by, grass, and, spaces, between, the, plaques, permit, families, to, place, flowers, and, other, objects, out, of, reach, of, the, mowing, a, natural, cemetery, eco, cemetery, green, cemetery, or, conservation, cemetery, is, a, new, style, of, cemetery, as, an, area, set, aside, for, natural, burials, with, or, without, coffins, natural, burials, are, motivated, by, a, desire, to, be, environmentally, conscious, with, the, body, rapidly, decomposing, and, becoming, part, of, the, natural, environment, without, incurring, the, environmental, cost, of, traditional, burials, certifications, may, be, granted, for, various, levels, of, green, burial, green, burial, certifications, are, issued, in, a, tiered, system, reflecting, level, of, natural, burial, practice, green, burial, certification, standards, designate, a, cemetery, as, hybrid, natural, or, conservation, burial, grounds, many, scientists, have, argued, that, natural, burials, would, be, a, highly, efficient, use, of, land, if, designed, specifically, to, save, endangered, habitats, ecosystems, and, species, the, opposite, has, also, been, proposed, instead, of, letting, natural, burials, permanently, protect, wild, landscapes, others, have, argued, that, the, rapid, decomposition, of, a, natural, burial, in, principle, allows, for, the, quick, re, use, of, grave, sites, in, comparison, with, conventional, burials, however, it, is, unclear, if, reusing, cemetery, land, will, be, culturally, acceptable, to, most, people, in, keeping, with, the, intention, of, returning, to, nature, and, the, early, re, use, potential, natural, cemeteries, do, not, normally, have, conventional, grave, markings, such, as, headstones, instead, exact, gps, recordings, and, or, the, placing, of, a, tree, bush, or, rock, often, marks, the, location, of, the, dead, so, grieving, family, and, friends, can, visit, the, precise, location, of, a, grave, columbarium, walls, are, a, common, feature, of, many, cemeteries, reflecting, the, increasing, use, of, cremation, rather, than, burial, while, cremated, remains, can, be, kept, at, home, by, families, in, urns, or, scattered, in, some, significant, or, attractive, place, neither, of, these, approaches, allows, for, a, long, lasting, commemorative, plaque, to, honour, the, dead, nor, provide, a, place, for, the, wider, circle, of, friends, and, family, to, come, to, mourn, or, visit, therefore, many, cemeteries, now, provide, walls, typically, of, brick, or, rendered, brick, construction, with, a, rectangular, array, of, niches, with, each, niche, being, big, enough, to, accommodate, a, person, s, cremated, remains, columbarium, walls, are, a, very, space, efficient, use, of, land, in, a, cemetery, compared, with, burials, and, a, niche, in, a, columbarium, wall, is, a, much, cheaper, alternative, to, a, burial, plot, a, small, plaque, about, 15, cm, x, 10, cm, can, be, affixed, across, the, front, of, each, niche, and, is, generally, included, as, part, of, the, price, of, a, niche, as, the, writing, on, the, plaques, has, to, be, fairly, small, to, fit, on, the, small, size, of, the, plaque, the, design, of, columbarium, walls, is, constrained, by, the, ability, of, visitors, to, read, the, plaques, thus, the, niches, are, typically, placed, between, 1, metre, to, 2, metres, above, the, ground, so, the, plaques, can, be, easily, read, by, an, adult, some, columbarium, walls, have, niches, going, close, to, ground, level, but, these, niches, are, usually, unpopular, with, families, as, it, is, difficult, to, read, the, plaque, without, bending, down, very, low, something, older, people, in, particular, find, difficult, or, uncomfortable, to, do, as, with, graves, the, niches, may, be, assigned, by, the, cemetery, authorities, or, families, may, choose, from, the, unoccupied, niches, available, it, is, usually, possible, to, purchase, or, pay, a, deposit, to, reserve, the, use, of, adjacent, niches, for, other, family, members, the, use, of, adjacent, niches, vertically, or, horizontally, usually, permits, a, larger, plaque, spanning, all, the, niches, involved, which, provides, more, space, for, the, writing, as, with, graves, there, may, be, separate, columbarium, walls, for, different, religions, or, for, war, veterans, as, with, lawn, cemeteries, the, original, expectation, was, that, people, would, prefer, the, uncluttered, simplicity, of, a, wall, of, plaques, but, the, practice, of, leaving, flowers, is, very, entrenched, mourners, leave, flowers, and, other, objects, on, top, of, columbarium, walls, or, at, the, base, as, close, as, they, can, to, the, plaque, of, their, family, member, in, some, cases, it, is, possible, to, squeeze, a, piece, of, wire, or, string, under, the, plaque, allowing, a, flower, or, small, posy, to, be, placed, on, the, plaque, itself, or, clips, are, glued, onto, the, plaque, for, that, purpose, newer, designs, of, columbarium, walls, take, this, desire, to, leave, flowers, into, account, by, incorporating, a, metal, clip, or, loop, beside, each, plaque, typically, designed, to, hold, a, single, flower, stem, or, a, small, posy, as, the, flowers, decay, they, simply, fall, to, the, ground, and, do, not, create, a, significant, maintenance, problem, while, uncommon, today, family, or, private, cemeteries, were, a, matter, of, practicality, during, the, settlement, of, america, if, a, municipal, or, religious, cemetery, had, not, been, established, settlers, would, seek, out, a, small, plot, of, land, often, in, wooded, areas, bordering, their, fields, to, begin, a, family, plot, sometimes, several, families, would, arrange, to, bury, their, dead, together, while, some, of, these, sites, later, grew, into, true, cemeteries, many, were, forgotten, after, a, family, moved, away, or, died, out, today, it, is, not, unheard, of, to, discover, groupings, of, tombstones, ranging, from, a, few, to, a, dozen, or, more, on, undeveloped, land, as, late, 20th, century, suburban, sprawl, pressured, the, pace, of, development, in, formerly, rural, areas, it, became, increasingly, common, for, larger, exurban, properties, to, be, encumbered, by, religious, easements, which, are, legal, requirements, for, the, property, owner, to, permit, periodic, maintenance, of, small, burial, plots, located, on, the, property, but, technically, not, owned, with, it, often, cemeteries, are, relocated, to, accommodate, building, however, if, the, cemetery, is, not, relocated, descendants, of, people, buried, there, may, visit, the, cemetery, there, is, also, the, practice, of, families, with, large, estates, choosing, to, create, private, cemeteries, in, the, form, of, burial, sites, monuments, crypts, or, mausoleums, on, their, property, the, mausoleum, at, fallingwater, is, an, example, of, this, practice, burial, of, a, body, at, a, site, may, protect, the, location, from, redevelopment, with, such, estates, often, being, placed, in, the, care, of, a, trust, or, foundation, in, the, united, states, state, regulations, have, made, it, increasingly, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, start, private, cemeteries, many, require, a, plan, to, care, for, the, site, in, perpetuity, private, cemeteries, are, nearly, always, forbidden, on, incorporated, residential, zones, many, people, will, bury, a, beloved, pet, on, the, family, property, all, of, the, saudis, in, al, baha, are, muslims, and, this, is, reflected, in, their, cemetery, and, funeral, customs, the, southern, tribal, hinterland, of, baha, home, to, especially, the, al, ghamdi, and, al, zahrani, tribes, has, been, renowned, for, centuries, for, their, tribal, cemeteries, that, are, now, slowly, vanishing, according, to, the, asharq, al, awsat, newspaper, one, old, villager, explained, how, tribal, cemeteries, came, about, people, used, to, die, in, large, numbers, and, very, rapidly, one, after, the, other, because, of, diseases, so, the, villagers, would, dig, graves, close, by, burying, members, of, the, same, family, in, one, area, that, was, how, the, family, and, tribal, burial, grounds, came, about, if, the, family, ran, out, of, space, they, would, open, old, graves, where, family, members, had, been, buried, before, and, add, more, people, to, them, this, process, is, known, as, khashf, during, famines, and, outbreaks, of, epidemics, huge, numbers, of, people, would, die, and, many, tribes, faced, difficulties, in, digging, new, graves, because, of, the, difficult, weather, in, the, past, some, arab, winters, lasted, for, more, than, six, months, and, would, be, accompanied, with, much, rain, and, fog, impeding, movement, but, due, to, tribal, rivalries, many, families, would, guard, their, cemeteries, and, put, restrictions, on, who, was, buried, in, them, across, baha, burial, grounds, have, been, constructed, in, different, ways, some, cemeteries, consist, of, underground, vaults, or, concrete, burial, chambers, with, the, capacity, of, holding, many, bodies, simultaneously, such, vaults, include, windows, for, people, to, peer, through, and, are, usually, decorated, ornately, with, text, drawings, and, patterns, at, least, one, resident, believes, that, the, graves, unique, in, the, region, because, many, are, not, oriented, toward, mecca, and, therefore, must, pre, date, islam, graves, are, terraced, in, yagoto, cemetery, which, is, an, urban, cemetery, situated, in, a, hilly, area, in, nagoya, japan, effectively, creating, stone, walls, blanketing, hillsides, the, cross, bones, is, a, burial, ground, for, prostitutes, in, london, the, neptune, memorial, reef, is, an, underwater, columbarium, near, key, biscayne, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, it, has, become, increasingly, common, for, cemeteries, and, funeral, homes, to, offer, online, services, there, are, also, stand, alone, online, cemeteries, such, as, discovereverafter, find, a, grave, canadian, headstones, interment, net, and, the, world, wide, cemetery, in, western, countries, and, many, others, visitors, to, graves, commonly, leave, cut, flowers, especially, during, major, holidays, and, on, birthdays, or, relevant, anniversaries, cemeteries, usually, dispose, of, these, flowers, after, a, few, weeks, in, order, to, keep, the, space, maintained, some, companies, offer, perpetual, flower, services, to, ensure, a, grave, is, always, decorated, with, fresh, flowers, flowers, may, often, be, planted, on, the, grave, as, well, usually, immediately, in, front, of, the, gravestone, for, this, purpose, roses, are, highly, common, in, some, regions, flowers, are, put, out, at, specific, times, called, decoration, days, visitors, to, loved, ones, interred, in, jewish, cemeteries, often, leave, a, small, stone, on, the, top, of, the, headstone, there, are, prayers, said, at, the, gravesite, and, the, stone, is, left, on, the, visitor, s, departure, it, is, done, as, a, show, of, respect, as, a, general, rule, flowers, are, not, placed, at, jewish, graves, flowers, are, fleeting, the, symbology, inherent, in, the, use, of, a, stone, is, to, show, that, the, love, honor, memories, and, soul, of, the, loved, one, are, eternal, this, practice, is, seen, in, the, closing, scene, of, the, film, schindler, s, list, although, in, that, case, it, is, not, on, a, jewish, grave, war, graves, will, commonly, have, small, timber, remembrance, crosses, left, with, a, red, poppy, attached, to, its, centre, these, will, often, have, messages, written, on, the, cross, more, formal, visits, will, often, leave, a, poppy, wreath, jewish, war, graves, are, sometimes, marked, by, a, timber, star, of, david, placing, burning, grave, candles, on, the, cemetery, to, commemorate, the, dead, is, a, very, common, tradition, in, catholic, nations, for, example, poland, it, is, mostly, practised, on, all, souls, day, the, traditional, grave, candles, are, called, znicz, in, polish, a, similar, practice, of, grave, candles, is, also, used, in, eastern, orthodox, christian, nations, as, well, as, the, lutheran, christian, nordic, countries, in, the, american, south, graves, of, children, are, often, decorated, with, emblems, of, childhood, these, include, favorite, toys, balloons, seasonal, decorations, religious, figurines, and, more, traditionally, cemetery, management, only, involves, the, allocation, of, land, for, burial, the, digging, and, filling, of, graves, and, the, maintenance, of, the, grounds, and, landscaping, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, headstones, and, other, grave, monuments, are, usually, the, responsibilities, of, surviving, families, and, friends, however, increasingly, many, people, regard, the, resultant, collection, of, individual, headstones, concrete, slabs, and, fences, some, of, which, may, be, decayed, or, damaged, to, be, aesthetically, unappealing, leading, to, new, cemetery, developments, either, standardising, the, shape, or, design, of, headstones, or, plaques, sometimes, by, providing, a, standard, shaped, marker, as, part, of, the, service, provided, by, the, cemetery, cemetery, authorities, normally, employ, a, full, time, staff, of, caretakers, to, dig, graves, the, term, gravedigger, is, still, used, in, casual, speech, though, many, cemeteries, have, adopted, the, term, caretaker, since, their, duties, often, involve, maintenance, of, the, cemetery, grounds, and, facilities, the, employment, of, skilled, personnel, for, the, preparation, of, graves, is, done, not, only, to, ensure, the, grave, is, dug, in, the, correct, location, and, at, the, correct, depth, but, also, to, relieve, families, from, having, to, dig, the, grave, for, a, recently, dead, relative, and, as, a, matter, of, public, safety, in, order, to, prevent, inexperienced, visitors, from, injuring, themselves, to, ensure, unused, graves, are, properly, covered, and, to, avoid, legal, liability, that, would, result, from, an, injury, related, to, an, improperly, dug, or, uncovered, grave, preparation, of, the, grave, is, usually, begins, before, mourners, arrive, for, the, burial, the, cemetery, caretakers, fill, the, grave, after, the, burial, generally, after, the, mourners, have, departed, mechanical, equipment, such, as, backhoes, are, used, to, reduce, labour, cost, of, digging, and, filling, but, some, hand, shovelling, may, still, be, required, in, the, united, kingdom, the, minimum, depth, from, the, surface, to, the, highest, lid, is, 36, inches, 91, cm, there, must, be, 6, inches, 15, cm, between, each, coffin, which, on, average, is, 15, inches, 38, cm, high, if, the, soil, is, free, draining, and, porous, only, 24, inches, 61, cm, of, soil, on, top, is, required, coffins, may, be, interred, at, lesser, depths, or, even, above, ground, as, long, as, they, are, encased, in, a, concrete, chamber, before, 1977, double, graves, were, dug, to, 8, feet, 240, cm, and, singles, to, 6, feet, 180, cm, as, a, single, grave, is, now, dug, to, 54, inches, 140, cm, old, cemeteries, contain, many, areas, where, new, single, graves, can, be, dug, on, old, ground, this, is, considered, a, valid, method, of, resource, management, and, provides, income, to, keep, older, cemeteries, viable, thus, forestalling, the, need, for, permanent, closure, which, would, result, in, a, reduction, of, their, work, force, the, key, is, a, central, element, of, christianity, keys, of, death, and, hell, as, a, metaphor, and, synonym, for, these, often, stands, the, cemetery, key, today, it, is, also, integrated, in, many, games, as, the, graveyard, key, holder, usually, there, is, a, legal, requirement, to, maintain, records, regarding, the, burials, or, interment, of, ashes, within, a, cemetery, these, burial, registers, usually, contain, at, a, minimum, the, name, of, the, person, buried, the, date, of, burial, and, the, location, of, the, burial, plots, within, the, cemetery, although, some, contain, far, more, detail, the, arlington, national, cemetery, one, of, the, united, states, largest, military, cemeteries, has, a, registry, the, anc, explorer, which, contains, details, such, as, photographs, of, the, front, and, back, of, the, tombstones, burial, registers, are, an, important, resource, for, genealogy, in, order, to, physically, manage, the, space, within, the, cemetery, to, avoid, burials, in, existing, graves, and, to, record, locations, in, the, burial, register, most, cemeteries, have, some, systematic, layout, of, graves, in, rows, generally, grouped, into, larger, sections, as, required, often, the, cemetery, displays, this, information, in, the, form, of, a, map, which, is, used, both, by, the, cemetery, administration, in, managing, their, land, use, and, also, by, friends, and, family, members, seeking, to, locate, a, particular, grave, within, the, cemetery, cemetery, authorities, face, a, number, of, tensions, in, regard, to, the, management, of, cemeteries, one, issue, relates, to, cost, traditionally, a, single, payment, is, made, at, the, time, of, burial, but, the, cemetery, authority, incurs, expenses, in, cemetery, maintenance, over, many, decades, many, cemetery, authorities, find, that, their, accumulated, funds, are, not, sufficient, for, the, costs, of, long, term, maintenance, this, shortfall, in, funds, for, maintenance, results, in, three, main, options, charge, much, higher, prices, for, new, burials, obtain, some, other, kind, of, public, subsidy, or, neglect, maintenance, for, cemeteries, without, space, for, new, burials, the, options, are, even, more, limited, public, attitudes, towards, subsidies, are, highly, variable, people, with, family, buried, in, local, cemeteries, are, usually, quite, concerned, about, neglect, of, cemetery, maintenance, and, will, usually, argue, in, favour, of, public, subsidy, of, local, cemetery, maintenance, whereas, other, people, without, personal, connection, to, the, cemetery, often, argue, that, public, subsidies, of, private, cemeteries, is, an, inappropriate, use, of, their, taxes, some, jurisdictions, require, a, certain, amount, of, money, be, set, aside, in, perpetuity, and, invested, so, that, the, interest, earned, can, be, used, for, maintenance, another, issue, relates, to, limited, amount, of, land, in, many, larger, towns, and, cities, the, older, cemeteries, which, were, initially, considered, to, be, large, often, run, out, of, space, for, new, burials, and, there, is, no, vacant, adjacent, land, available, to, extend, the, cemetery, or, even, land, in, the, same, general, area, to, create, new, cemeteries, new, cemeteries, are, generally, established, on, the, periphery, of, towns, and, cities, where, large, tracts, of, land, are, still, available, however, people, often, wish, to, be, buried, in, the, same, cemetery, as, other, relatives, and, are, not, interested, in, being, buried, in, new, cemeteries, with, which, there, is, no, sense, of, connection, to, their, family, creating, pressure, to, find, more, space, in, existing, cemeteries, a, third, issue, is, the, maintenance, of, monuments, and, headstones, which, are, generally, the, responsibility, of, families, but, often, become, neglected, over, time, decay, and, damage, through, vandalism, or, cemetery, maintenance, practices, can, render, monuments, and, headstones, either, unsafe, or, at, least, unsightly, on, the, other, hand, some, families, do, not, forget, the, grave, but, constantly, visit, leaving, behind, flowers, plants, and, other, decorative, items, that, create, their, own, maintenance, problem, all, of, these, issues, tend, to, put, pressure, on, the, re, use, of, grave, sites, within, cemeteries, the, re, use, of, graves, already, used, for, burial, can, cause, considerable, upset, to, family, members, although, the, authorities, might, declare, that, the, grave, is, sufficiently, old, that, there, will, be, no, human, remains, still, present, nonetheless, many, people, regard, the, re, use, of, graves, particularly, their, family, s, graves, as, a, desecration, also, re, use, of, a, used, grave, involves, the, removal, of, any, monuments, and, headstones, which, may, cause, further, distress, to, families, although, families, will, typically, be, allowed, to, take, away, the, monuments, and, headstones, if, they, wish, on, the, other, hand, cemetery, authorities, are, well, aware, that, many, old, graves, are, forgotten, and, not, visited, and, that, their, re, use, will, not, cause, distress, to, anyone, however, there, may, be, some, older, graves, in, a, cemetery, for, whom, there, are, local, and, vocal, descendants, who, will, mount, a, public, campaign, against, re, use, one, pragmatic, strategy, is, to, publicly, announce, plans, to, re, use, older, graves, and, invite, families, to, respond, if, they, are, willing, or, not, re, use, then, only, occurs, where, there, are, no, objections, allowing, the, forgotten, graves, to, be, re, used, sometimes, the, cemetery, authorities, request, a, further, payment, to, avoid, re, use, of, a, grave, but, often, this, backfires, politically, a, practical, problem, with, regard, to, contacting, families, is, that, the, person, who, initially, purchased, the, burial, plot, s, may, have, subsequently, died, and, locating, living, family, members, if, any, many, decades, later, is, virtually, impossible, or, at, least, prohibitively, expensive, public, notice, about, the, proposed, re, use, of, graves, may, or, may, not, reach, family, members, living, further, afield, who, may, object, to, such, practices, therefore, it, is, possible, that, re, use, could, occur, without, family, awareness, some, cemeteries, did, foresee, the, need, for, re, use, and, included, in, their, original, terms, and, conditions, a, limited, tenure, on, a, grave, site, and, most, new, cemeteries, follow, this, practice, having, seen, the, problems, faced, by, older, cemeteries, common, practice, in, europe, is, to, place, bones, in, an, ossuary, after, the, proscribed, burial, period, is, over, however, even, when, the, cemetery, has, the, legal, right, to, re, use, a, grave, strong, public, opinion, often, forces, the, authorities, to, back, down, on, that, re, use, also, even, when, cemeteries, have, a, limited, tenure, provision, in, place, funding, shortages, can, force, them, to, contemplate, re, use, earlier, than, the, original, arrangements, provided, for, another, type, of, grave, site, considered, for, re, use, are, empty, plots, purchased, years, ago, but, never, used, in, principle, it, would, seem, easier, to, re, use, such, grave, sites, as, there, can, be, no, claims, of, desecration, but, often, this, is, made, complicated, by, the, legal, rights, to, be, buried, obtained, by, the, pre, purchase, as, any, limited, tenure, clause, only, takes, effect, after, there, has, been, a, burial, again, cemetery, authorities, suspect, that, in, many, cases, the, holders, of, these, burial, rights, are, probably, dead, and, that, nobody, will, exercise, that, burial, right, but, again, some, families, are, aware, of, the, burial, rights, they, possess, and, do, intend, to, exercise, them, as, and, when, family, members, die, again, the, difficulty, of, being, unable, to, locate, the, holders, of, these, burial, rights, complicates, the, re, use, of, those, graves, as, historic, cemeteries, begin, to, reach, their, capacity, for, full, burials, alternative, memorialization, such, as, collective, memorials, for, cremated, individuals, is, becoming, more, common, different, cultures, have, different, attitudes, to, destruction, of, cemeteries, and, use, of, the, land, for, construction, in, some, countries, it, is, considered, normal, to, destroy, the, graves, while, in, others, the, graves, are, traditionally, respected, for, a, century, or, more, in, many, cases, after, a, suitable, period, of, time, has, elapsed, the, headstones, are, removed, and, the, now, former, cemetery, is, converted, to, a, recreational, park, or, construction, site, a, more, recent, trend, particularly, in, south, american, cities, involves, constructing, high, rise, buildings, to, house, graves, cemeteries, in, the, us, may, be, relocated, if, the, land, is, required, for, other, reasons, for, instance, many, cemeteries, in, the, southeastern, united, states, were, relocated, by, the, tennessee, valley, authority, from, areas, about, to, be, flooded, by, dam, construction, cemeteries, may, also, be, moved, so, that, the, land, can, be, reused, for, transportation, structures, public, buildings, or, even, private, development, cemetery, relocation, is, not, necessarily, possible, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, alberta, canada, for, instance, the, cemetery, act, expressly, forbids, the, relocation, of, cemeteries, or, the, mass, exhumation, of, marked, graves, for, any, reason, whatsoever, this, has, caused, significant, problems, in, the, provision, of, transportation, services, to, the, southern, half, of, calgary, as, the, main, southbound, road, connecting, the, south, end, of, the, city, with, downtown, threads, through, a, series, of, cemeteries, founded, in, the, 1930s, the, light, rail, transit, line, running, to, the, south, end, eventually, had, to, be, built, directly, under, the, road, in, singapore, burials, are, limited, to, 15, years, before, graves, are, exhumed, this, has, led, to, a, preference, of, cremation, over, burial, among, singaporeans, in, many, countries, cemeteries, are, places, believed, to, hold, both, superstition, and, legend, characteristics, being, used, usually, at, night, times, as, an, altar, in, supposed, black, magic, ceremonies, or, similarly, clandestine, happenings, such, as, devil, worshipping, grave, robbing, gold, teeth, and, jewelry, are, preferred, thrilling, sex, encounters, or, drug, and, alcohol, abuse, not, related, to, the, cemetery, aura, the, legend, of, zombies, as, romanticized, by, wade, davis, in, the, serpent, and, the, rainbow, is, not, exceptional, among, cemetery, myths, as, cemeteries, are, believed, to, be, places, where, witches, and, sorcerers, get, skulls, and, bones, needed, for, their, sinister, rituals, in, the, afro, brazilian, urban, mythos, such, as, umbanda, there, is, a, character, loosely, related, to, cemeteries, and, its, aura, the, z, pilintra, in, fact, z, pilintra, is, more, related, to, bohemianism, and, night, life, than, with, cemeteries, where, the, reigning, entity, is, exu, caveira, or, exu, cemit, rio, similar, to, voodoo, baron, samedi
