agnosticism, is, the, view, or, belief, that, the, existence, of, god, the, divine, or, the, supernatural, is, either, unknowable, in, principle, or, unknown, in, fact, it, can, also, mean, an, apathy, towards, such, religious, belief, and, refer, to, personal, limitations, rather, than, a, worldview, another, definition, is, the, view, that, human, reason, is, incapable, of, providing, sufficient, rational, grounds, to, justify, either, the, belief, that, god, exists, or, the, belief, that, god, does, not, exist, the, english, biologist, thomas, henry, huxley, said, that, he, originally, coined, the, word, agnostic, in, 1869, to, denote, people, who, like, confess, themselves, to, be, hopelessly, ignorant, concerning, a, variety, of, matters, about, which, metaphysicians, and, theologians, both, orthodox, and, heterodox, dogmatise, with, the, utmost, confidence, earlier, thinkers, had, written, works, that, promoted, agnostic, points, of, view, such, as, sanjaya, belatthiputta, a, 5th, century, bce, indian, philosopher, who, expressed, agnosticism, about, any, afterlife, and, protagoras, a, 5th, century, bce, greek, philosopher, who, expressed, agnosticism, about, the, existence, of, the, gods, principle, may, be, stated, in, various, ways, but, they, all, amount, to, this, that, it, is, wrong, for, a, man, to, say, that, he, is, certain, of, the, objective, truth, of, any, proposition, unless, he, can, produce, evidence, which, logically, justifies, that, certainty, this, is, what, agnosticism, asserts, and, in, my, opinion, it, is, all, that, is, essential, to, agnosticism, agnosticism, in, fact, is, not, a, creed, but, a, method, the, essence, of, which, lies, in, the, rigorous, application, of, a, single, principle, positively, the, principle, may, be, expressed, in, matters, of, the, intellect, follow, your, reason, as, far, as, it, will, take, you, without, regard, to, any, other, consideration, and, negatively, in, matters, of, the, intellect, do, not, pretend, that, conclusions, are, certain, which, are, not, demonstrated, or, demonstrable, that, which, agnostics, deny, and, repudiate, as, immoral, is, the, contrary, doctrine, that, there, are, propositions, which, men, ought, to, believe, without, logically, satisfactory, evidence, and, that, reprobation, ought, to, attach, to, the, profession, of, disbelief, in, such, inadequately, supported, propositions, consequently, agnosticism, puts, aside, not, only, the, greater, part, of, popular, theology, but, also, the, greater, part, of, anti, theology, on, the, whole, the, bosh, of, heterodoxy, is, more, offensive, to, me, than, that, of, orthodoxy, because, heterodoxy, professes, to, be, guided, by, reason, and, science, and, orthodoxy, does, not, being, a, scientist, above, all, else, huxley, presented, agnosticism, as, a, form, of, demarcation, a, hypothesis, with, no, supporting, objective, testable, evidence, is, not, an, objective, scientific, claim, as, such, there, would, be, no, way, to, test, said, hypotheses, leaving, the, results, inconclusive, his, agnosticism, was, not, compatible, with, forming, a, belief, as, to, the, truth, or, falsehood, of, the, claim, at, hand, karl, popper, would, also, describe, himself, as, an, agnostic, according, to, philosopher, william, l, rowe, in, this, strict, sense, agnosticism, is, the, view, that, human, reason, is, incapable, of, providing, sufficient, rational, grounds, to, justify, either, the, belief, that, god, exists, or, the, belief, that, god, does, not, exist, george, h, smith, while, admitting, that, the, narrow, definition, of, atheist, was, the, common, usage, definition, of, that, word, and, admitting, that, the, broad, definition, of, agnostic, was, the, common, usage, definition, of, that, word, promoted, broadening, the, definition, of, atheist, and, narrowing, the, definition, of, agnostic, smith, rejects, agnosticism, as, a, third, alternative, to, theism, and, atheism, and, promotes, terms, such, as, agnostic, atheism, the, view, of, those, who, do, not, hold, a, belief, in, the, existence, of, any, deity, but, claim, that, the, existence, of, a, deity, is, unknown, or, inherently, unknowable, and, agnostic, theism, the, view, of, those, who, believe, in, the, existence, of, a, deity, s, but, claim, that, the, existence, of, a, deity, is, unknown, or, inherently, unknowable, agnostic, from, ancient, greek, a, without, and, gn, sis, knowledge, was, used, by, thomas, henry, huxley, in, a, speech, at, a, meeting, of, the, metaphysical, society, in, 1869, to, describe, his, philosophy, which, rejects, all, claims, of, spiritual, or, mystical, knowledge, early, christian, church, leaders, used, the, greek, word, gnosis, knowledge, to, describe, spiritual, knowledge, agnosticism, is, not, to, be, confused, with, religious, views, opposing, the, ancient, religious, movement, of, gnosticism, in, particular, huxley, used, the, term, in, a, broader, more, abstract, sense, huxley, identified, agnosticism, not, as, a, creed, but, rather, as, a, method, of, skeptical, evidence, based, inquiry, the, term, agnostic, is, also, cognate, with, the, sanskrit, word, aj, asi, which, translates, literally, to, not, knowable, and, relates, to, the, ancient, indian, philosophical, school, of, aj, ana, which, proposes, that, it, is, impossible, to, obtain, knowledge, of, metaphysical, nature, or, ascertain, the, truth, value, of, philosophical, propositions, and, even, if, knowledge, was, possible, it, is, useless, and, disadvantageous, for, final, salvation, in, recent, years, scientific, literature, dealing, with, neuroscience, and, psychology, has, used, the, word, to, mean, not, knowable, in, technical, and, marketing, literature, agnostic, can, also, mean, independence, from, some, parameters, for, example, platform, agnostic, referring, to, cross, platform, software, or, hardware, agnostic, scottish, enlightenment, philosopher, david, hume, contended, that, meaningful, statements, about, the, universe, are, always, qualified, by, some, degree, of, doubt, he, asserted, that, the, fallibility, of, human, beings, means, that, they, cannot, obtain, absolute, certainty, except, in, trivial, cases, where, a, statement, is, true, by, definition, e, g, tautologies, such, as, all, bachelors, are, unmarried, or, all, triangles, have, three, corners, also, called, hard, closed, strict, or, permanent, agnosticism, strong, agnosticism, is, the, view, that, the, question, of, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, a, deity, or, deities, and, the, nature, of, ultimate, reality, is, unknowable, by, reason, of, our, natural, inability, to, verify, any, experience, with, anything, but, another, subjective, experience, a, strong, agnostic, would, say, i, cannot, know, whether, a, deity, exists, or, not, and, neither, can, you, also, called, soft, open, empirical, hopeful, or, temporal, agnosticism, weak, agnosticism, is, the, view, that, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, any, deities, is, currently, unknown, but, is, not, necessarily, unknowable, therefore, one, will, withhold, judgment, until, evidence, if, any, becomes, available, a, weak, agnostic, would, say, i, don, t, know, whether, any, deities, exist, or, not, but, maybe, one, day, if, there, is, evidence, we, can, find, something, out, the, view, that, no, amount, of, debate, can, prove, or, disprove, the, existence, of, one, or, more, deities, and, if, one, or, more, deities, exist, they, do, not, appear, to, be, concerned, about, the, fate, of, humans, therefore, their, existence, has, little, to, no, impact, on, personal, human, affairs, and, should, be, of, little, interest, an, apathetic, agnostic, would, say, i, don, t, know, whether, any, deity, exists, or, not, and, i, don, t, care, if, any, deity, exists, or, not, throughout, the, history, of, hinduism, there, has, been, a, strong, tradition, of, philosophic, speculation, and, skepticism, the, rig, veda, takes, an, agnostic, view, on, the, fundamental, question, of, how, the, universe, and, the, gods, were, created, nasadiya, sukta, creation, hymn, in, the, tenth, chapter, of, the, rig, veda, says, but, after, all, who, knows, and, who, can, say, whence, it, all, came, and, how, creation, happened, the, gods, themselves, are, later, than, creation, so, who, knows, truly, whence, it, has, arisen, whence, all, creation, had, its, origin, he, whether, he, fashioned, it, or, whether, he, did, not, he, who, surveys, it, all, from, highest, heaven, he, knows, or, maybe, even, he, does, not, know, aristotle, anselm, aquinas, descartes, and, g, del, presented, arguments, attempting, to, rationally, prove, the, existence, of, god, the, skeptical, empiricism, of, david, hume, the, antinomies, of, immanuel, kant, and, the, existential, philosophy, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, convinced, many, later, philosophers, to, abandon, these, attempts, regarding, it, impossible, to, construct, any, unassailable, proof, for, the, existence, or, non, existence, of, god, in, his, 1844, book, philosophical, fragments, kierkegaard, writes, let, us, call, this, unknown, something, god, it, is, nothing, more, than, a, name, we, assign, to, it, the, idea, of, demonstrating, that, this, unknown, something, god, exists, could, scarcely, suggest, itself, to, reason, for, if, god, does, not, exist, it, would, of, course, be, impossible, to, prove, it, and, if, he, does, exist, it, would, be, folly, to, attempt, it, for, at, the, very, outset, in, beginning, my, proof, i, would, have, presupposed, it, not, as, doubtful, but, as, certain, a, presupposition, is, never, doubtful, for, the, very, reason, that, it, is, a, presupposition, since, otherwise, i, would, not, begin, readily, understanding, that, the, whole, would, be, impossible, if, he, did, not, exist, but, if, when, i, speak, of, proving, god, s, existence, i, mean, that, i, propose, to, prove, that, the, unknown, which, exists, is, god, then, i, express, myself, unfortunately, for, in, that, case, i, do, not, prove, anything, least, of, all, an, existence, but, merely, develop, the, content, of, a, conception, hume, was, huxley, s, favourite, philosopher, calling, him, the, prince, of, agnostics, diderot, wrote, to, his, mistress, telling, of, a, visit, by, hume, to, the, baron, d, holbach, and, describing, how, a, word, for, the, position, that, huxley, would, later, describe, as, agnosticism, did, not, seem, to, exist, or, at, least, was, not, common, knowledge, at, the, time, the, first, time, that, m, hume, found, himself, at, the, table, of, the, baron, he, was, seated, beside, him, i, don, t, know, for, what, purpose, the, english, philosopher, took, it, into, his, head, to, remark, to, the, baron, that, he, did, not, believe, in, atheists, that, he, had, never, seen, any, the, baron, said, to, him, count, how, many, we, are, here, we, are, eighteen, the, baron, added, it, isn, t, too, bad, a, showing, to, be, able, to, point, out, to, you, fifteen, at, once, the, three, others, haven, t, made, up, their, minds, raised, in, a, religious, environment, charles, darwin, 1809, 1882, studied, to, be, an, anglican, clergyman, while, eventually, doubting, parts, of, his, faith, darwin, continued, to, help, in, church, affairs, even, while, avoiding, church, attendance, darwin, stated, that, it, would, be, absurd, to, doubt, that, a, man, might, be, an, ardent, theist, and, an, evolutionist, although, reticent, about, his, religious, views, in, 1879, he, wrote, that, i, have, never, been, an, atheist, in, the, sense, of, denying, the, existence, of, a, god, i, think, that, generally, an, agnostic, would, be, the, most, correct, description, of, my, state, of, mind, agnostic, views, are, as, old, as, philosophical, skepticism, but, the, terms, agnostic, and, agnosticism, were, created, by, huxley, 1825, 1895, to, sum, up, his, thoughts, on, contemporary, developments, of, metaphysics, about, the, unconditioned, william, hamilton, and, the, unknowable, herbert, spencer, though, huxley, began, to, use, the, term, agnostic, in, 1869, his, opinions, had, taken, shape, some, time, before, that, date, in, a, letter, of, september, 23, 1860, to, charles, kingsley, huxley, discussed, his, views, extensively, i, neither, affirm, nor, deny, the, immortality, of, man, i, see, no, reason, for, believing, it, but, on, the, other, hand, i, have, no, means, of, disproving, it, i, have, no, a, priori, objections, to, the, doctrine, no, man, who, has, to, deal, daily, and, hourly, with, nature, can, trouble, himself, about, a, priori, difficulties, give, me, such, evidence, as, would, justify, me, in, believing, in, anything, else, and, i, will, believe, that, why, should, i, not, it, is, not, half, so, wonderful, as, the, conservation, of, force, or, the, indestructibility, of, matter, it, is, no, use, to, talk, to, me, of, analogies, and, probabilities, i, know, what, i, mean, when, i, say, i, believe, in, the, law, of, the, inverse, squares, and, i, will, not, rest, my, life, and, my, hopes, upon, weaker, convictions, that, my, personality, is, the, surest, thing, i, know, may, be, true, but, the, attempt, to, conceive, what, it, is, leads, me, into, mere, verbal, subtleties, i, have, champed, up, all, that, chaff, about, the, ego, and, the, non, ego, noumena, and, phenomena, and, all, the, rest, of, it, too, often, not, to, know, that, in, attempting, even, to, think, of, these, questions, the, human, intellect, flounders, at, once, out, of, its, depth, and, again, to, the, same, correspondent, may, 6, 1863, i, have, never, had, the, least, sympathy, with, the, a, priori, reasons, against, orthodoxy, and, i, have, by, nature, and, disposition, the, greatest, possible, antipathy, to, all, the, atheistic, and, infidel, school, nevertheless, i, know, that, i, am, in, spite, of, myself, exactly, what, the, christian, would, call, and, so, far, as, i, can, see, is, justified, in, calling, atheist, and, infidel, i, cannot, see, one, shadow, or, tittle, of, evidence, that, the, great, unknown, underlying, the, phenomenon, of, the, universe, stands, to, us, in, the, relation, of, a, father, loves, us, and, cares, for, us, as, christianity, asserts, so, with, regard, to, the, other, great, christian, dogmas, immortality, of, soul, and, future, state, of, rewards, and, punishments, what, possible, objection, can, i, who, am, compelled, perforce, to, believe, in, the, immortality, of, what, we, call, matter, and, force, and, in, a, very, unmistakable, present, state, of, rewards, and, punishments, for, our, deeds, have, to, these, doctrines, give, me, a, scintilla, of, evidence, and, i, am, ready, to, jump, at, them, of, the, origin, of, the, name, agnostic, to, describe, this, attitude, huxley, gave, the, following, account, when, i, reached, intellectual, maturity, and, began, to, ask, myself, whether, i, was, an, atheist, a, theist, or, a, pantheist, a, materialist, or, an, idealist, christian, or, a, freethinker, i, found, that, the, more, i, learned, and, reflected, the, less, ready, was, the, answer, until, at, last, i, came, to, the, conclusion, that, i, had, neither, art, nor, part, with, any, of, these, denominations, except, the, last, the, one, thing, in, which, most, of, these, good, people, were, agreed, was, the, one, thing, in, which, i, differed, from, them, they, were, quite, sure, they, had, attained, a, certain, gnosis, had, more, or, less, successfully, solved, the, problem, of, existence, while, i, was, quite, sure, i, had, not, and, had, a, pretty, strong, conviction, that, the, problem, was, insoluble, and, with, hume, and, kant, on, my, side, i, could, not, think, myself, presumptuous, in, holding, fast, by, that, opinion, so, i, took, thought, and, invented, what, i, conceived, to, be, the, appropriate, title, of, agnostic, it, came, into, my, head, as, suggestively, antithetic, to, the, gnostic, of, church, history, who, professed, to, know, so, much, about, the, very, things, of, which, i, was, ignorant, to, my, great, satisfaction, the, term, took, in, 1889, huxley, wrote, therefore, although, it, be, as, i, believe, demonstrable, that, we, have, no, real, knowledge, of, the, authorship, or, of, the, date, of, composition, of, the, gospels, as, they, have, come, down, to, us, and, that, nothing, better, than, more, or, less, probable, guesses, can, be, arrived, at, on, that, subject, william, stewart, ross, 1844, 1906, wrote, under, the, name, of, saladin, he, was, associated, with, victorian, freethinkers, and, the, organization, the, british, secular, union, he, edited, the, secular, review, from, 1882, it, was, renamed, agnostic, journal, and, eclectic, review, and, closed, in, 1907, ross, championed, agnosticism, in, opposition, to, the, atheism, of, charles, bradlaugh, as, an, open, ended, spiritual, exploration, in, why, i, am, an, agnostic, c, 1889, he, claims, that, agnosticism, is, the, very, reverse, of, atheism, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, declared, why, i, am, not, a, christian, in, 1927, a, classic, statement, of, agnosticism, he, calls, upon, his, readers, to, stand, on, their, own, two, feet, and, look, fair, and, square, at, the, world, with, a, fearless, attitude, and, a, free, intelligence, in, 1939, russell, gave, a, lecture, on, the, existence, and, nature, of, god, in, which, he, characterized, himself, as, an, atheist, he, said, the, existence, and, nature, of, god, is, a, subject, of, which, i, can, discuss, only, half, if, one, arrives, at, a, negative, conclusion, concerning, the, first, part, of, the, question, the, second, part, of, the, question, does, not, arise, and, my, position, as, you, may, have, gathered, is, a, negative, one, on, this, matter, however, later, in, the, same, lecture, discussing, modern, non, anthropomorphic, concepts, of, god, russell, states, that, sort, of, god, is, i, think, not, one, that, can, actually, be, disproved, as, i, think, the, omnipotent, and, benevolent, creator, can, in, russell, s, 1947, pamphlet, am, i, an, atheist, or, an, agnostic, subtitled, a, plea, for, tolerance, in, the, face, of, new, dogmas, he, ruminates, on, the, problem, of, what, to, call, himself, as, a, philosopher, if, i, were, speaking, to, a, purely, philosophic, audience, i, should, say, that, i, ought, to, describe, myself, as, an, agnostic, because, i, do, not, think, that, there, is, a, conclusive, argument, by, which, one, can, prove, that, there, is, not, a, god, on, the, other, hand, if, i, am, to, convey, the, right, impression, to, the, ordinary, man, in, the, street, i, think, i, ought, to, say, that, i, am, an, atheist, because, when, i, say, that, i, cannot, prove, that, there, is, not, a, god, i, ought, to, add, equally, that, i, cannot, prove, that, there, are, not, the, homeric, gods, in, his, 1953, essay, what, is, an, agnostic, russell, states, an, agnostic, thinks, it, impossible, to, know, the, truth, in, matters, such, as, god, and, the, future, life, with, which, christianity, and, other, religions, are, concerned, or, if, not, impossible, at, least, impossible, at, the, present, time, are, agnostics, atheists, no, an, atheist, like, a, christian, holds, that, we, can, know, whether, or, not, there, is, a, god, the, christian, holds, that, we, can, know, there, is, a, god, the, atheist, that, we, can, know, there, is, not, the, agnostic, suspends, judgment, saying, that, there, are, not, sufficient, grounds, either, for, affirmation, or, for, denial, later, in, the, essay, russell, adds, i, think, that, if, i, heard, a, voice, from, the, sky, predicting, all, that, was, going, to, happen, to, me, during, the, next, twenty, four, hours, including, events, that, would, have, seemed, highly, improbable, and, if, all, these, events, then, produced, to, happen, i, might, perhaps, be, convinced, at, least, of, the, existence, of, some, superhuman, intelligence, in, 1965, christian, theologian, leslie, weatherhead, 1893, 1976, published, the, christian, agnostic, in, which, he, argues, many, professing, agnostics, are, nearer, belief, in, the, true, god, than, are, many, conventional, church, goers, who, believe, in, a, body, that, does, not, exist, whom, they, miscall, god, although, radical, and, unpalatable, to, conventional, theologians, weatherhead, s, agnosticism, falls, far, short, of, huxley, s, and, short, even, of, weak, agnosticism, of, course, the, human, soul, will, always, have, the, power, to, reject, god, for, choice, is, essential, to, its, nature, but, i, cannot, believe, that, anyone, will, finally, do, this, robert, g, ingersoll, 1833, 1899, an, illinois, lawyer, and, politician, who, evolved, into, a, well, known, and, sought, after, orator, in, 19th, century, america, has, been, referred, to, as, the, great, agnostic, in, an, 1896, lecture, titled, why, i, am, an, agnostic, ingersoll, related, why, he, was, an, agnostic, is, there, a, supernatural, power, an, arbitrary, mind, an, enthroned, god, a, supreme, will, that, sways, the, tides, and, currents, of, the, world, to, which, all, causes, bow, i, do, not, deny, i, do, not, know, but, i, do, not, believe, i, believe, that, the, natural, is, supreme, that, from, the, infinite, chain, no, link, can, be, lost, or, broken, that, there, is, no, supernatural, power, that, can, answer, prayer, no, power, that, worship, can, persuade, or, change, no, power, that, cares, for, man, i, believe, that, with, infinite, arms, nature, embraces, the, all, that, there, is, no, interference, no, chance, that, behind, every, event, are, the, necessary, and, countless, causes, and, that, beyond, every, event, will, be, and, must, be, the, necessary, and, countless, effects, is, there, a, god, i, do, not, know, is, man, immortal, i, do, not, know, one, thing, i, do, know, and, that, is, that, neither, hope, nor, fear, belief, nor, denial, can, change, the, fact, it, is, as, it, is, and, it, will, be, as, it, must, be, in, the, conclusion, of, the, speech, he, simply, sums, up, the, agnostic, position, as, we, can, be, as, honest, as, we, are, ignorant, if, we, are, when, asked, what, is, beyond, the, horizon, of, the, known, we, must, say, that, we, do, not, know, in, 1885, ingersoll, explained, his, comparative, view, of, agnosticism, and, atheism, as, follows, the, agnostic, is, an, atheist, the, atheist, is, an, agnostic, the, agnostic, says, i, do, not, know, but, i, do, not, believe, there, is, any, god, the, atheist, says, the, same, canon, bernard, iddings, bell, 1886, 1958, a, popular, cultural, commentator, episcopal, priest, and, author, lauded, the, necessity, of, agnosticism, in, beyond, agnosticism, a, book, for, tired, mechanists, calling, it, the, foundation, of, all, intelligent, christianity, agnosticism, was, a, temporary, mindset, in, which, one, rigorously, questioned, the, truths, of, the, age, including, the, way, in, which, one, believed, god, his, view, of, robert, ingersoll, and, thomas, paine, was, that, they, were, not, denouncing, true, christianity, but, rather, a, gross, perversion, of, it, part, of, the, misunderstanding, stemmed, from, ignorance, of, the, concepts, of, god, and, religion, historically, a, god, was, any, real, perceivable, force, that, ruled, the, lives, of, humans, and, inspired, admiration, love, fear, and, homage, religion, was, the, practice, of, it, ancient, peoples, worshiped, gods, with, real, counterparts, such, as, mammon, money, and, material, things, nabu, rationality, or, ba, al, violent, weather, bell, argued, that, modern, peoples, were, still, paying, homage, with, their, lives, and, their, children, s, lives, to, these, old, gods, of, wealth, physical, appetites, and, self, deification, thus, if, one, attempted, to, be, agnostic, passively, he, or, she, would, incidentally, join, the, worship, of, the, world, s, gods, in, unfashionable, convictions, 1931, he, criticized, the, enlightenment, s, complete, faith, in, human, sensory, perception, augmented, by, scientific, instruments, as, a, means, of, accurately, grasping, reality, firstly, it, was, fairly, new, an, innovation, of, the, western, world, which, aristotle, invented, and, thomas, aquinas, revived, among, the, scientific, community, secondly, the, divorce, of, pure, science, from, human, experience, as, manifested, in, american, industrialization, had, completely, altered, the, environment, often, disfiguring, it, so, as, to, suggest, its, insufficiency, to, human, needs, thirdly, because, scientists, were, constantly, producing, more, data, to, the, point, where, no, single, human, could, grasp, it, all, at, once, it, followed, that, human, intelligence, was, incapable, of, attaining,

ways, of, knowing, however, humanism, like, agnosticism, was, also, temporal, and, would, eventually, lead, to, either, scientific, materialism, or, theism, he, lays, out, the, following, thesis, demographic, research, services, normally, do, not, differentiate, between, various, types, of, non, religious, respondents, so, agnostics, are, often, classified, in, the, same, category, as, atheists, or, other, non, religious, people, a, 2010, survey, published, in, encyclop, dia, britannica, found, that, the, non, religious, people, or, the, agnostics, made, up, about, 9, 6, of, the, world, s, population, a, november, december, 2006, poll, published, in, the, financial, times, gives, rates, for, the, united, states, and, five, european, countries, the, rates, of, agnosticism, in, the, united, states, were, at, 14, while, the, rates, of, agnosticism, in, the, european, countries, surveyed, were, considerably, higher, italy, 20, spain, 30, great, britain, 35, germany, 25, and, france, 32, a, study, conducted, by, the, pew, research, center, found, that, about, 16, of, the, world, s, people, the, third, largest, group, after, christianity, and, islam, have, no, religious, affiliation, according, to, a, 2012, report, by, the, pew, research, center, agnostics, made, up, 3, 3, of, the, us, adult, population, in, the, u, s, religious, landscape, survey, conducted, by, the, pew, research, center, 55, of, agnostic, respondents, expressed, a, belief, in, god, or, a, universal, spirit, whereas, 41, stated, that, they, thought, that, they, felt, a, tension, being, non, religious, in, a, society, where, most, people, are, religious, according, to, the, 2021, australian, bureau, of, statistics, 38, 9, of, australians, have, no, religion, a, category, that, includes, agnostics, between, 64, and, 65, of, japanese, and, up, to, 81, of, vietnamese, are, atheists, agnostics, or, do, not, believe, in, a, god, an, official, european, union, survey, reported, that, 3, of, the, eu, population, is, unsure, about, their, belief, in, a, god, or, spirit, agnosticism, is, criticized, from, a, variety, of, standpoints, some, atheists, criticize, the, use, of, the, term, agnosticism, as, functionally, indistinguishable, from, atheism, this, results, in, frequent, criticisms, of, those, who, adopt, the, term, as, avoiding, the, atheist, label, theistic, critics, claim, that, agnosticism, is, impossible, in, practice, since, a, person, can, live, only, either, as, if, god, did, not, exist, etsi, deus, non, daretur, or, as, if, god, did, exist, etsi, deus, daretur, according, to, pope, benedict, xvi, strong, agnosticism, in, particular, contradicts, itself, in, affirming, the, power, of, reason, to, know, scientific, truth, he, blames, the, exclusion, of, reasoning, from, religion, and, ethics, for, dangerous, pathologies, such, as, crimes, against, humanity, and, ecological, disasters, agnosticism, said, benedict, is, always, the, fruit, of, a, refusal, of, that, knowledge, which, is, in, fact, offered, to, man, the, knowledge, of, god, has, always, existed, he, asserted, that, agnosticism, is, a, choice, of, comfort, pride, dominion, and, utility, over, truth, and, is, opposed, by, the, following, attitudes, the, keenest, self, criticism, humble, listening, to, the, whole, of, existence, the, persistent, patience, and, self, correction, of, the, scientific, method, a, readiness, to, be, purified, by, the, truth, the, catholic, church, sees, merit, in, examining, what, it, calls, partial, agnosticism, specifically, those, systems, that, do, not, aim, at, constructing, a, complete, philosophy, of, the, unknowable, but, at, excluding, special, kinds, of, truth, notably, religious, from, the, domain, of, knowledge, however, the, church, is, historically, opposed, to, a, full, denial, of, the, capacity, of, human, reason, to, know, god, the, council, of, the, vatican, declares, god, the, beginning, and, end, of, all, can, by, the, natural, light, of, human, reason, be, known, with, certainty, from, the, works, of, creation, blaise, pascal, argued, that, even, if, there, were, truly, no, evidence, for, god, agnostics, should, consider, what, is, now, known, as, pascal, s, wager, the, infinite, expected, value, of, acknowledging, god, is, always, greater, than, the, finite, expected, value, of, not, acknowledging, his, existence, and, thus, it, is, a, safer, bet, to, choose, god, according, to, richard, dawkins, a, distinction, between, agnosticism, and, atheism, is, unwieldy, and, depends, on, how, close, to, zero, a, person, is, willing, to, rate, the, probability, of, existence, for, any, given, god, like, entity, about, himself, dawkins, continues, i, am, agnostic, only, to, the, extent, that, i, am, agnostic, about, fairies, at, the, bottom, of, the, garden, dawkins, also, identifies, two, categories, of, agnostics, temporary, agnostics, in, practice, taps, and, permanent, agnostics, in, principle, paps, he, states, that, agnosticism, about, the, existence, of, god, belongs, firmly, in, the, temporary, or, tap, category, either, he, exists, or, he, doesn, t, it, is, a, scientific, question, one, day, we, may, know, the, answer, and, meanwhile, we, can, say, something, pretty, strong, about, the, probability, and, considers, pap, a, deeply, inescapable, kind, of, fence, sitting, a, related, concept, is, ignosticism, the, view, that, a, coherent, definition, of, a, deity, must, be, put, forward, before, the, question, of, the, existence, of, a, deity, can, be, meaningfully, discussed, if, the, chosen, definition, is, not, coherent, the, ignostic, holds, the, noncognitivist, view, that, the, existence, of, a, deity, is, meaningless, or, empirically, untestable, a, j, ayer, theodore, drange, and, other, philosophers, see, both, atheism, and, agnosticism, as, incompatible, with, ignosticism, on, the, grounds, that, atheism, and, agnosticism, accept, the, statement, a, deity, exists, as, a, meaningful, proposition, that, can, be, argued, for, or, against
